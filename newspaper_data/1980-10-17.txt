State is 
losing 
top ed'l 
position 

LOS ANGELES (AP) -
An education larm has been 
sounded by a UC task force, 
which says current funding 
cutbacks for public schools 
are "tragic" at a time when 
academic achievement has 
been falling at all levels. 

The study report was 
presented to the UC Board of 
Regents as their two-day 
meeting, which opened at the 
Los Angeles Convention 
Center yesterday. Several 
regents agreed the report was 
disturbing, but something 
that could help chan~e the 
attitudes of the pubhc and 
lawmakers. 

Agreement may disinte-
grate when the regents tackle 
today's agenda , which 
includes a regents committee 
report on a controversial 
proposal endorsed by Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr, who 
also is one of the 26 regents. 
Brown asked the board last 
month to create an oversight 
committee to deal with 
environment, safety and 
personnel matters at the UC 
Laboratories . 

Four UC laboratories 
operate under $867 million a 
year in contracts with the 
Federal Department of 
Energy. Research on 
weapons and nuclear projects 
are among the UC lab 
actiVities at Los Alamos, 
N.M., and Livermore. 

The governor's motion 
called for an oversight 
committee which would have 
complete access to all

Reagan gives up campus 
to Anderson campaign 
BY CARMELITA ROSAL 

JUdging from the number 
of Anderson posters 
plastered across campus and 
the constant activity that 
surrounds the independent 
presidential candidate's table 
on Revelle Plaza, one might 
conclude that UCSD is an 
"Anderson cam~us." 

In fact, that s what the 
local organizer for Ronald 
Reagan's university cam-
paign said as he packed up his 
buttons and leaflet and 
headed off for greener 

, pastures at San Diego State. 
And according to Bruce 

Lyons, Anderson's UCSD 
campaign coordinator, 

literally hundreds of 
students have turned out in 
suport for the so-called 
"alternative to Carter and 
Reagan." 

A total of 150 students are 
currently working to 
r,romote the Anderson 
'crusade," and many others 

stop by the plaza table daily 
to get informatin on their 
candidate, Lyons says. 

Perhaps the strength of the 
Anderson campaign on this 
campus can be measured by 
the appearance of the tables 
set up for each candidate. 
Anderson offers t-shirts, 
buttons and bumperstickers 
- all for a donation, of 

course. The Carter support-
ers arejust beginnin~tocome 
forward with their hterature 
aimed at the university 
student, and, as mentioned, 
~eagan's crews gave up due 
to lack of interest here. 

Indeed, other third party 
presidential candidates have 
their following, but Ander-
son's is by far the most 
visible. 

All this is encouraging to 
Lyons and his associates, but 
they are well aware that 
Anderson lags far behind the 
major-party candidates in the 
polls.

]. William Hollingsworth, 
M.D. has been appointed 
acting Dean of the UCSD 
School of Medicine, Chancel-
lor Richard Atki nson 
announced today. The 
appointment is effective on 
November 1. 

Hollingsworth has been on 
the School of Medicine 
faculty since 1978 as a 
professor of medicine, vice-
chairman of the department 
and as chief of medicine at 
the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in La Jolla. 

Hollingsworth will be the 
interim dean while a search 
com m i ttee chooses a 
replacement for John H. 
Moxley, M.D., who recently 
resigned as dean in order to 
continue his sabbatical 
activities as the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for 
Health Affairs. Marvin R. 
Dunn, M.D. , current Acting

faculty both through his 
energetic and effective work 
over the pas~ two years, and

clinician, investigator, 
teacher, and department 
chair, and I am confident that ' 
he can provide the leadership 
essential to the continued 
progress of the School of 
Medicine during the search 
process for a permanent 
dean. " 

Hollingsworth received his 
medical degree from Duke 
University in 1948. After 
completing internship and

A Health 
Center 
attack? 
Interw is 
dissatisfied 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
A.lIOClate New. Editor 

"I've talked to many 
people, both students and 
staff at the Health Center. 
Everyone says this task force 
investigation sounds like a 
witch hunt," said Diane 
Rosenberg, Reg Fee Commit-
tee intern at the Health 
Center. 

Rosenberg, whose position 
is officially "Student Health 
Om buds Person," attended 
yesterday's AS Task Force on 
the Health Center meeting, 
and voiced her discontent 
with the task force's 
priorities. 

The task force, chaired by 
the AS Council member Pam 
Gerber, hopes to "identify the 
probiems at the Health 
Center and then formulate 
effective proposals that (Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard) Armitage can do 
something with," said 
Gerber.' 

But .. Rosenberg argues, "I 
work in the Health Center, 
dealing with students and 
complaints they have about • 
the health services." She is 
offended because "no one 
approached me" about the 
task force. 

"Personally, I believe the 
biggest issue facing us now is 
student insurance and 
alternatives to existing 
coverage available," she 
added. 

While insurance is one area 
the AS task force plans to 
investigate, other issues such 
as cost-effectiveness and 
quality ,of Health Center 
services, peer health 
counseling and prescription 
and grievance procedures 
wjll be explored . 

Rosenberg appeared 
receptive to an idea of 
separating the task force 
committees. Vice Chancellor 
Armitage will consider that 
idea. 

On the issue of grievance 
procedur~osenberg said a 
" mechanism for student 
grievances already exists on 
campus," and that it was 
"unfair" cJf the task force to 
assert otherwise. 

One area of responsibility 
Rosenberg has is to "serve as 
an advocate to solicit and 
facilitate complaints and 
suggestions" from students 
and staff about the Health 
Center, the Vice Chancellor's 
office said . 

Gerber believes, though, 
that "students aren 't aware 
(Rosenberg's) position exists 
and don 't know where to go 
with their complaints." 

AS official Nancy Lap 
added that the ta k force 
"hopes to establish hearing 
procedures so student can 
voice complaints again t the

unpredictability which is 
reality, and by and large they 
had to be discarded.

Abernathy backs 
Ronald Reagan 

(AP) - One of the nation's 
best known Black leader gave 
Ronald Reagan a surprise 
endorsemen yesterday, 
while the White House 
disavowed a claim by another 
prominent Wack, Andrew 
Youn~, that Reagan's 
campaIgn rhetoric means 
"it's going to be all right top 
kill niglfers when he's 
president. ' 

With President Carter and 
his GOP rival campaigning 
their way toward a joint 
evening appearance at a 
charity dinner in New York, 
White House Spokesman Ray 
jenkins said Young 's 
statement last week does not 
represent the president's 
view. 

The Rev. Ralph David 
Abernathy, like YoungacJose 
associate of the late Martin 
Luther King Kr., offered his 
endorsement at a news 
conference in Detroit with 
Reagan and GOP vice 
presidential candidate 
George Bush. 

"Crie has increased, 
inflation has increased, 
unemployment has increased 
and interest rates have 

increased since Carter took 
office," he said. 

"Poor Black people cannot 
make it under this type of 
system, for another six 
months, and we don't need 
this doctor any more, because 
we as the patient are getting 
sicker. .. " 

Independent candidate 
john B. Anderson, mean· 
while, told supporters that all 
the plJs showing he is sinking 
are inaccurate and meaning· 
less. 

"I think when all the 
results are in the polls are 
going to have the worst time 
they have had since theX 
elected Alf Landon in 1936, ' 
he said. "I think victory is 
st ilJ out there. I think this 
election still can be won." 

Young's aide, confirmed 
the statement attributed to 
the former U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations, who 
was criticizing Reagan 's use 
of the phrase "states rights" 
- early in the campaign. 

Reagan, campaigning in 
Philadelphia, Miss. , on Aug.,

Fornter USC president 
defends adntissions record 

LOS ANGELES (AP) -Former president 
Jobo Hubbud III the University of Southern 
California said athletes were admitted to the 
achool just as were law students who might be 
"biah risk." . 

H'e did admit that two members of the staff 
dn:umvented rules in giving grades to 
athletes who did not attend classes. 

"Where we got into trouble was that one 
instance," said Hubbard. now president· 
emeritus and a professor of history. 

He referred to charges, sustained by the 
current president, that 330 scholasticly 
deficient athletes had been admitted to the 
school over the past ten years. 

(UCSD's Chancellor Atkinson was one of 
the finalists in a search to replace Hubbard, 
but withdrew from the process) 

". take serious disagreement with this 
phrase academically deficient," said Hubbard, 

Prepare for; 

the school's president for ten yws. 
"What • determined to do when I became 

president here wa to try to open up the 
accessibility to private sector institutions in 
the same fashion that has been opened in the 
pu III ic sector." 

Hubbard said enrollment in the law school, 
for instance, was increased by 50 to allow 
minority and educationatly underpriviliged 
students to enroll. The size of the freshman 
class was also increased. 

"We did it with the notion that if we could 
provide the proper kind of remedial support 
and attention that a gooJi percentage would 
make it." 

He blamed the current USC athletic 
problem on two men, Jeff Birren, academic 
athletic advisor, and Prof. John DeBross ofthe 
speech communications department. 

Both have resigned from USC.

Weather is ruining 
campus computers 

Power "blinks" during the 
last two weeks have 
wreaked havoc with campus 
computer systems, accord· ins. to Tom Tribble, a central 
utilities supervisor. 

Tribble says that the 11 
momentary breaks in power 
occured outside the 
university on San Diego Gas 
and Electric lines. He says 
SDG&E blames the power 
failures on the heavy fog 
that has blanketed the area 
lately. 

When the power fails, the 
"most frequently noticed 
equipment is computers," 
Tribble says. He explains 
that computers are "on line" 
constantly and are most 

suceptible to a drop in 
electricity. 

The brief power outges 
have caused some damage to 
computer discs and software 
around cameras, but Tribble 
says the damage is 
repairable. SDG&E officials 
have told him that they are 
not liable for any costs 
involved in fixing the 
equipment. 

Tribble warns that any 
sensitive equipment that 
used electricity during the 
last 14 days may have been 
affected adversely and that 
in assessing recent equip-
ment damage, operators 
should take into account the 
ongoing power problems. 

Com'ty colleges 
not aiding UC 

LOS ANGELES - The 
number of students transfer· 
ring from community 
colleges to the University of 
California has declined 
steadily from 1975 to the 
present. At the same time, 
more students are coming to 
UC directly from high school 
rather than through the 
community college transfer 
route. 

These findings are 
contained in a report of the 
UC Task Force on Retention 
and Transfer and were 
discussed Thursday, October 
16 wit" UC Regents by Task 
Force 'chairman, Gerald R. 
Kissler, associate director of 
planning at UCLA. 

In the fall of 1975, 8,000 
students transferred to UC 
m.n community colleges. In 
the same year, UC had 15,460 
students as first·time 
freshmen from California 
high schools. The numbers 
for the fall of 1979 are 5,336 
and 15.977 respectively. 

In addition, in Fall 1975, 23 
percent of the high school 
graduates who were eligible 
for admission to UC chose to 
go to a community college. 
Current data indicate that 

only 13 percent of UC·eligible 
high school students say 
their first choice is to attend a 
community college. 

Pointing out tht in 1978,20 
out 72 community college 
districts sent fewer than 20 
students to the UC campus· 
es the Task Force reprt 
states, "the demographic 
trends, the changes in 
student interests and the 
reduction in State funding 
have resuted in a downward 
spiral that threatens the 
transfer function at many 
community colleges . . 

"A consequence, if this 
trend continues, could be 
that community colleges will 
not be able to afford to offer 
both the vocational and 
community service programs 
their students demand and 
the breadth and quality of 
academic work that will 
prepare students for transfer 
to UC." 

The Task Force group 
recommended that chancel-
lors, in cooperation with the 
faculty, "make every effort to 
improve communication and 
articulation with the 
community colleges in their 
local areas."

Peace Corps, VISTA push 
recruiting on 20th birthday 

In the decades s ince the 
Peace Corps was fir s t 
proposed to University of 
Michigan students 20 years 
ago , the international 
program has continued to 
draw most of its over 80,000 
volunteers from campuses 
such as the University of 
California, according to an 
agency spokesman. 

The trend is expected to 
continue through the 1980s, 
says Dennis Ferguson, a San 
Diego-based representat ive of 
the ACTION umbrella 
agency which federally funds 
and administers the Peace 
Corps, VISTA (Volunteers In 
Service To America) and 
other volunteer programs 
such as the University Year 
for ACTION program on the 
UCSD campus. 

The 33·year·old former 
Peace Corps volunteer 
arrives on campus Oct. 21 for 
three days of handing out 
applications and information 
in Revelle Plaza, followed one 
day of applicant interviews in 
the Career Planning Center 
Oct. 27. The information 
booth will be open from 9 am 
to 3 pm each day on the 
Revelle campus. 

While idealism has been 
observed to wane since Oct. 
14, 1960 when then · 
Jresidential hopeful John F. 
Kennedy first advanced the 
idea of a Peace Corps to the 
Ann Arbor, Mich. students 
and faculty, campuses have 
continued to be responsive to 
volunteer service, if for 
different and IOmetimes less 

idealistic reasons than 
originally envisioned. 

Most university students 
today are looking for jobs, 
Ferguson thinks, and a year 
of practical job experience is 
holding more appeal to 
graduating seniors. He said 
that the UCSD drive will 
match many academic 
specialties with "areas of 
current need" in Peace Corps 
host countries in Asia , 
Africa, Latin America and 
the Pacific. 

Ferguson, who technically 
assited small businesses and 
helped establish a school and 
sports complex while a Peace 
Corps volunteer in Ecuador, 
identified those overseas 
needs as improving health 
care programs and facilities 
and teaching an array of 
subjects, including math, 
science and english . 

He pointed to over ten 
different programs open to 
biologists in West Africa, 
Central America and other 
global regions for classroom 
assignments and working in 
developing fisheries projects. 

'A minor or major can qualify 
seniors for secondary level 
teaching assignments in 
Belize or Malaysia. 

For liberal arts majors, 
openings can be found that 
match interests in agricul· 
ture, health, the trades and in 
recently developed internat· 
ional technologies such as 
showing Central African 
Republic villagers how to 
save firewood by building 
mud stoves and using solar 

devices. 
The tw'o years·plus of 

living and working in 
another, often totally 
different culture encourage 
volunteer self·reliance and 
creativity but Ferguson also 
s tressed that the assign-
ments also require a high 
degree of flexibility and 
patience. 

In VISTA, the domestic 
equivilant of the Corps, 
volunteers work through 
sponsoring neighborhood 
non· profit agencies to bring 
low·income people together 
so they can collectively solve 
community problems of 
common concern. One· year 
assignments in all 50 states 
are now open to UCSD 
seniors. 

The widest range of 
activities may be found in 
community development 
projects, Ferguson said. Most 
of the 4,000 VISTA volunters 
who are scattered across the 
country work in community 
development which encom· 
passes everything from 
solving housing problems to 
improving health care servics 
for the elderly. Ferguson is 
hopeful of attracting social 
science, health and liberal 
arts majors . Like their 
overseas counterparts, 
VISTAs receive a monthly 
subsistence allowance, 
medical coverage, plus $75 to 
set aside for each month of 
service . 

Peace Corps and VISTA 
can both be reached by phone

The demand for books about motion

just a n08taJgia aaze; it reflects the 
public's sincere interest in movie

'Somewhere' a place for 
Chris Reeves and Jane Seymor 

LYNETTE TOM 
StaU Wriler 

Ever wonder what happened to the good old 
days of the "bigger than life" romantic films? 
No need to: the genre's just been dusted off and 
restored to its former glory by director Jeannot 
Szwac in his latest picture, Somewhere In 
Time. 

Those who have read Bid Time Relurn by 
Richard Matheson will see the bare bones of 
the science fiction author's novel fleshed out 
in the film. After eight years of stage success, 
playwright Richard Colleir has exhausted all 
his literary resources. His writer's block leads 
him to a nostalgic escape: alma mater Millfield 
College and th~ Grand Hotel. 

It's during his stopover at the second 
location that he falls hopelessly in love with 
the portrait 0 Elsie McKenna, a renowned 
actress at the turn of the century. But there's 
80mething hauntingly familiar about her face, 
and after a series of coincedental dates and 
suspcious tum of events Richard comes to a 
startling conclusion: Eight years ago, Elsie 
had given him an antique gold watch - a 
timepiece that he left behind with her another 
60 years before. When the shock of the news 
finally sinks in, the playwright resolves, 
through hypnosis, to return to (and this time, 
remain in) 1912. 

Matheson has made co n siderab le 
modifications of his original work to come up 
with the script. A case in point is the 
protagonist, who suffered from an inoperable 
brain tumor in the novel; this devise has been 
used to excess in film . What's left is a clean 
and simple script. 

Szwarc, in turn, takes the script and adds 
polish. Sometimes, though, the blance isn't 
even. The ending, in all its etheral splendor, is 
a bit over·blown, while the scenes of Richard's 
languishings over Elsie's portait and his 
hypnotic session stagnate and spoil the overall 
effect. 

Not the kind of actor to wallow miserably in 
the typecasting pool, Christopher Reeve is 
superb as Richard Collier. His portrayal of a 
playwright who challanges the time barrier in 
his search for a lost love demonstrates that 
Reeves' talents aren't reserved for soap operas 
and comicbooks. Jane Seymor as McKenna is 
breathtaking. In recent years, Christopher 
Plummer has played extreme 'good/ bad 
incarnates, such as Sherlock Holmes, 
in Murder By Decree and the sadistic murder 
Reilker in The Siknt Par/~r. 

Somwhere In Time is now showing at the

Fontana's 'sound sculpture' uses two tape 
recorders over 30ft. apart to create a sound delay 

commerate its one hundredt h 
anniversary. 

"I'd like to do something 
special with the Brooklyn 
Brid~e - a traveling 
exposition," says Fontana. 
"What I'd like to do is pick up 
live sOunds up along the 
bridge and transmit them to 
distant locations like Paris or 
San Francisco. 

"With help from the phone 
company anyone could hear a 
live signal sent from the 
bridge to anywhere in the 
world ," he adds. 

Fontana is also looking 
forward to exploring building 
design. While he admits that 
"it seems abnormal to design 
something out of concern for 
what it will sound like," says 

he is willing to challenge 
tqlditional architecture. 

Along with "Incoming 
Wavefronts" the Mandeville 
Gallery exhibit included a 
recorded portion of "Oscilla· 
ting Steel Grids" and a 
sculpture which recorded 
and played back the sounds 
within the gallery.

Basketball practice begins in two weeks under the 
direction of John Block, new head basketball coach. 
Block was named to replace Ron Carter, who resigned 
!!l8t month citing conflicting time requirements.

Block named to replace 
Carter as bask'ball coach 

BY TIM LIOTTA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Former San Diego Rocket 
and ten-year NBA veteran 
lohn Block has been named 
as the new head coach of the 
UCSD varsity basketball 
team. 

Block replaces Ron 
Carter, who resigned from 
the position on Sept. 30 after 
just one year in the post. 

Though virtually untried 
in the coaching ranks, Block 
brings a wealth of experience 
to coaching. He spent ten 
years in the NBA with seven 
different teams. 

His career in the NBA 
began after he was selected in 
the second round of the 1966 
college draft by the Los 
Angeles Lakers after being 
named an All-American in his 
senior year at USC. 

The highlight of Block's 
professional career came in 
1972 when he was named to 
the NBA AII·Star team. 

Back surgery ended his 
playing career in 1976, so 
Block spent two years as an 
assistant coach to Tim Vieze 
at San Diego State. SDSU 

won the conference cham· 
pionship both years. 

The new coach takes over a 
team coming off its most 
successfu l year ever. The 
Tritons amassed a 17-12 
regular season record, giving 
them a three·way tie for first 
place in the NAJA District III 
Southern Division. 

Last year's Tritons played 
an exciting brand of run and 
gun basketball, setting new 
highs in point production 
(83.0 per game) and field goal 
percentage (49.7%). 

With nine returning 
players and those recruited 
by Carter in the off season, 
competition on this year's 
squad should be fierce. 

The position of head 
basketball coach at UCSD 
has been unstable and 
chaotic in the UCSD 
program. Block is the fourth 
coach in three years. 

After Barry Cunningham 
resigned at the end of the 
1978·79 season, the depart· 
ment hired Robert Kloppen-
burg. He never coached a 
game, resigning just before 
schoolbeganlastyear~otake 

a scouting position WIth the 
NBA's Seattle Supersonics. 

As late as October, the post 
was still unfilled. The 
department finally decided 
on Carter. the vice principal 
at Romoria junior High 
School. 

After just one season, 
Carter handed in his 
resignation, stating that the 
two jobs were too much for 
him to handle.' "( wanted to 
do the very best job (can and ( 
find it difficult todoon a part· 
time basis," he said. 

The part-time status of the 
intercollegiate coaches has 
plagued the intercollesriate 
department with the high 
turnover in a number of 
positions. 

Coach Block's ideas on 
coaching seem to fit UCSD. 
He considers himself an 
offensively oriented coach, 
which is the style the 
Tritons used last year. 

"We wi\l be a running 
team," said Block, "which 
means we have to play 
fundementally sound 
defense."

The United States Air Force will send representatives to campus tomorrow although the 

visit will be for recreational rather than for recruiting purposes. ' 
The women's volleyball team hosts the women cadets from the Colorado's Air Force 

Academy for a 2 pm contest in the main gym tomorrow. The Academy enrollees' appearance 
here stems from their wish to branch ut in their area of competitIOn. 

A match against Westmont College at 9 am precedes the Tnton contest. The Cadets fly

Men's swiID teaDl moves to 
NCAA; wOlDen get new coach 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
Four years ago when Bill 

Mor_an inherited the 
positIOn of head swim coach 
at UCSD, he inherited a team 
with little talent and little 
direction. After only one 
short season, Morgan 

man~ to reverse this 
trend and was on his way to 
building a powerful swim 

'~~r talented waik-on 
awimmers and a handful of 
others, UCSD capped its first 
season under Coach Morgan 
with a 14th place finish at the 
NAIA nationals. 

talent which will give the 
team some needed depth, 
especially in the butterfly 
and backstroke. 

Perhaps the most imp'or' 
tant aspect of the upcoming 
season is the team s move 
from the NAJA to NCAA. 

This is important finan· 
cially because the NCAA 
pays all transportation cost s 
to the nationals. . 

"The NCAA qualifying 
standards are sliJhtly faster, 
and the competition is a little 
tougher, but I think we 
should place well," says 
MorRan. 

harder this year and I'm 
willing to give 100 percent 
effort if they put in 100 
percent," he said. 

Dann is supportive of 
Morgan . "I think his 
workouts are demanding," 
she said, "but he's 
reasonable, and any women 
who shows up and partic-
ipates at the workouts is 
almost guaranteed to go to 
the nationals." 

She is also very positive 
about combining the men's 
and women's teams under 
one coach: "combining the 
teams will make the women 

work harder and wi1\ create a 
situation where everyone has 
more support." 

The swimmers begin their 
season in early October with 
one workout a day - a mere 
5,000 yards - at 6 am. 

This leads into more 
intense practices later in the 
season, with the two grueling 
workouts a day in addition to 
Nautilus weight training. 
During this time, each 
swimmer wi\1 average 
between eight and fifteen 
thousand yards per day 
(approximately five to ten 
miles). 

The hi¥hlight of this 
intense tralOing period is two 
weeks of winter vacation 
during which Morgan 
devotes special attention to 
all the swimmers. These ae 

known as Hell Weeks. Hell 
Weeks are times of dedica· 
tion, headaches, muscle 
aches, and personal confron-
tations with the Piano Man. 

The fabled Piano Man 
strikes when the swimmer 
reaches a high level of fatigue 
which forces him to settle 
into a pace suitable for 
dragging a piano the length of 
the pool. 

The culmination of the 
season comes in March when 
the Nautilus weight training 
ends, workouts are cut back 
to one a day, and the yardage 
is drastically reduced. The 
mental aspects of the sport 
become important as the 
swimmers enter this 
tapering·of{ period and 
psychologically prepare 
themselves for important 
meets. . The following year saw six 

swimmers carry the Triton 
name to Alabama, where 
they finished 10th in the 1979 
natlOllals. 

Not to be outdone by the 
previous year's performance, 
a team of ten UCSD 
swimmers broke into the top 
ten teams at the 1980 NAIA 
nationals with a strong 8th 
place finish. Receiving All-
American honors were Mark 
Allen, Steve Beal, John 
Beckley, Bob Conlin, Chris 
Dixon, Lance Halsted, Joe 
Hernandez, Roger Kirton and 
Kevin Lingle. A tenth 
swimmer, Steve Best, 
narrowly missed qualifying 
88 an AIl-American. 

The women's swim-
ming season will be a 
periOd of change. Both new 
and returning athletes must 
adjust to Morgan's coaching 
style. Morgan replaces Diana 
Dann, who retired from 
coaching last year. She left on 
a high note, with four 
swimmers qualifying for the 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics for Women 
Division m nationals durng 
the 1980 season. Fortunately 
for Morgan, three of last 
year's Qualifie-rs are 
returning, and this year's 
team will definitely look to 
Sandy Groos, Claudia 
O'Brien and Natalie Pierce 
for leadership. 

Triton record drops to 3-2

The Tritons are moving up

has a good shot at the title.

Morgan approaches his 
new role as women's coach

The Women's volleyball 
team fell to Azusa Pacific 
Tuesday in a four·game 
contest, 15-10, HH5, 15-3 and 
15-2. 

The loss to the national 
champions and the Triton 
nemesis took UCSD's league 
record to 3-2, following a split 
of two weekend contests. 

Over the weekend the team 
won over Westmont on

Friday but succumbed to Cal 
Lutheran Saturday. 

Azusa-Pacific, though not 
as impressive as last year, 
was still in championship 
form, led by two All· 
Americans. Their experience 
intimidated the Triton's 
young, and experienced 
team. Although the team's 
defense was very weak, it put 
up an admirable offensive 
stand, led by spikers Michele 
Whitmore and Cheryl

Wright. 

The Tritons consistently 
got off to slow starts against 
Azusa-Pacific and soon grew 
frustrated by careless 
mistakes. 

The two road games prior 
to the match took their toll on 
the rookies. Doug Dannevik, 
roach for the team, still feels 
that despite the two recent 
losses, the team still has time 
to pull itself together.

against them dropped. 

And to mark the culmina-
tion of National Anti·Draft 
Week, SDSP plans an 
informational rally at noon 
on ReveIle Plaza. Following 
the rally, SDSPorganizersay 
that transportation will be 
provided for students who 
wish to attend the downtown 
hearing. 

Sosna says a picket line 
will be set up in front of the 
courthouse from 12:15 - 1:15 
pm. The picketin~ is 
endorsed by San Diego's 
Coalition Against Registra-
tion for the Draft. 

After the picketing, Sosna 
says, participants are 
encouraged to watch the 
hearing. 

The hearing was continued 
until today because not 
enough judges were present 
to hear cases at the first 
hearing Oct. 3. 

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Interior Secretary Cecil D. 
Andrus announced yesterday 
a tentative decision to 
auction oil and gas leases off 
the coast of central California 
next May, but erased the 
northern California offshore 
area from his list. 

Andrus said he would 
reach a final decision after 
receiving and considering 
comments from the govern-
ors of California and Oregon. 
Andrus deleted from the sale 
127 tracts in four basins off 
northern California: Point 
Arena, Bodega, Santa Cruz 
and Eel River. 

He proposed offering 115 
tracts in the Santa Maria 
basin, covering a total of 
006,2:77 acres. 

The U.S. Geological 
Survey has estimated that 
the area may contain some 
788 million barrels of oil and 
just over one trillion cubic 
feet of natural gas. 

The proposed lease area 
lies from three to 27 miles off 
the shores of San Luis Obispo 
and northern Santa Barbara 
County, in water ranging 
from 165 to 2,300 feet deep (50 
to 700 meters). 

The tracts would be 
auctioned through a variety 
of bidding systems now 
offered by the department. 

The Interior Department 
took the first steps toward 
petroleum leasing off central 
and northern California on 
Nov. 29, 1977, when it invited 
the oil industry and other 
interested parties to suggest 
which tracts should be offere 
or withheld within a broad 
area of more than 10.7 million 
acres. 

Peripheral canal 
will go to a vote 

SACRAMENTO (AP) -
The author of the Peripheral 
Canal bin said yesterday he 
was not perturbed that 
opponents have succeeded in 
putting the issue on the 
statewide ballot, and 
predicted the people will 
endorse the canal. 

But sponsors of the first 
CalifornIa referendum since 
1952 said they were confident 
the people will overrule the 
Legislature's approval of the 
43 -mile canal on the 
periphery of the Sacramento-
San Joaquin Delta. 

The $600 million canal 
would take Sacr amento River 
water straight to the 
aqueduct leading south, 
increasing export of northern 
water to the San Joaquin 
Valley and Southern 
California. 

"The people in Southern 
California are not going to 
roll over and play dead," said 
Sen Ruben Ayala, D-Chirno, 
whose bill calling for 
construction of the canal 
passed the Legislature earlier 
this year after a four·year 
fight. The vote was split 
along North·South lines. 

He said the proponents of 
the canal had doen nothing to 
oppose qualification of the 
referendum, but predicted a 
well-financed campaign to 
defeat it at the polls. 

Opponents say the canal 
would damage the Delta and 
the San Francisco Bay and 
most of the water would 
unjustly enrich corporate 
landowners . Proponents 
ay the south will soon be 

desperate for the extra water 
and that the canal would 
lmprove conditions in the 
Delta and Bay. 

Medical 
School 
Dean 
continued from page 1 
over the next thirteen rears. 
He was the director 0 both 
the Rheumatology Division 
and the Clinical Research 
Center at Yale and was chief 
of the Medical Service at the 
West Haven Veterans 
Administration Hospital. 

While at Yale, Hollings· 
worth also spent two years in 
Hiroshima as chief of the 
Medical Service for the 
Atomic Bomb Casualty 
Commission. 

From 1968 - 1978 Hollings-
worth was a professor of 
medicine and chairman of 
that department at the 
University of Kentucky 
College of Medicine. 

Despite the administrative 
demands on his time 
throughout his career, 
Hollingsworth has also 
purused research in the fields 
of hematology and rheumato-
logy and has published 
numerous scientific articles 
and two books based on his 
studies. 

His wife, Dorothy, is also 
on the School of Medicine 
faculty as a profesor of 
reproductive medicine. 

The industry nominated 
more than 8.4 million acres, 
but the department said it got 
47 .comments opposing 
leaslOg, a record number for 
an undeveloped area. 

The department narrowed 
the propsal down to some 1.3 
mi1l!on acres and performed 
envIronmental studies on 
them. 

Explaining his deletion of 
the Pt. Arena, Bodega and 
Santa Cruz basins, Andrus 
said, "My decision reflects 
my best judgement as to the 
balance between ou r 
continuing need for domestic 
sources of energy and other 
important considerations 
inc\udingthe preferences and 
the well· being of people in 

coastal areas who may be 
affected by offshore oil and 
gas activities. 

Of the Eel River deletion, 
Andrus said his decision was 
strongly influenced by the 
lack of analysis of the · 
environmental impacts of 
possible discoveries of oil 
there.

Anderson 
continued from page 1 

"If Reagan sways his 
decision on an issue, 53 
percent of Reagan voters will 
plump for Anderson and 27 
percent (will vote) for 
Carter," Lyons says. "If 
Carter falters on a sensitive 
issue such as the hostages 
situation in Iran , there are 
chances that 49 percent will 
vote for Reagan,' 

Citing these statistics, 
Lyons says it is not 
altogether impossible that 
Anderson rou ld come out 
ahead on Nov. 4. "If the 
election is going to be held 
tomorrow, Anderson will 
have a marginal chance of 
winning the office," he says. 

Although Anderson's poll 
rankings have been fluctua-
tinf a great deal lately , Lyons 
be ieves many UCSD 
students have stuck with 
him because of his platform 
position against registration 
and the draft. 

Ly ons <ldd s tht "in 
California, a vote for John 

Anderson is definitely a vote 
against Reagan's and 
Carter's stances on current 
issues such as the Equal 
Rights Amendment, abor-
tion, education, draft and 
foreign policy," 

In an effort to increase the 
number of Anderson voters 
here, Lyons has assigned 
precinct captains and 
volunteers to campaign and 
take preference polls in 
residence haJls and local off· 
campus student housing 
areas_ 

Times poll shows Reagan 
ahead with 40 percent of the 
vote, Carter second with 28 
percent and Anderson 
trailing third with only 11 
percent, 

Although Anderson 's 
chances of winning in 
November seem dismal , 
Lyons expresses optimism 
that Reagan and Carter 
supporters will sh ift their 
votes to Anderson at the last 
minu te. 

Health Center Task 
Force is questioned 
continued from page 1 
Health Center,' 

Rosenberg went on to 
comment that the task 
force's questionnaire for the 
Health Center to survey 
student and personnel 
opinion on quality of services 
there, would "ignore an 
untapped resource ... 

"A questionnaire in the 
Health Center only addresses 
people who use the services," 
said Rosenberg. "By not 
reaching the students who 
don't use the services, you're 
not drawing from a wide 
range of student opinions_" 

Task force mem bers 

agreed with Rosenberg on 
that point , but Gerber noted 
that there "should be 
something visible and 
accessible to students who 
use the Health Center now." 

Rosen berg was also critical 
of the task force's lack of 
familiarity with procedures 
at the Health Center: 

"To have a constructive 
effect on the total welfare of 
students, you have to do your 
homework and you have to be 
organized," she said. 

Gerber ron ceded that she 
has a lot to learn and that the 
investigation is "stil in the 
planning stages." 

DC Regents 
continued from page 1 
information pertaining to the 
laboratories operation_ 

Regent rommenting on tJte 
task force report that was 
presented yesterday, agreed 
that an all-out campaign 
must be carried to voters and 
state legislators, with the 
message that educational 
funding needs higher 
priority. 

"I am particularly 
roncemed about the quality 
of preparation for roJlege in 
the high schools from which 
the university's underrepre-
sented ethnic minority 
students gradujlte." said 
Gerald R. Kissler, chairman 
of the university task force 
studying undergraduate 
enrollment factors. 

"The outlook is bleak for 
the future of elementary and 
secondary education, 
because of state voter 
approval of spending 
limitation measures Prop. 13 
and Prop, 4," said Kissler, 
associate director of planning 
at UCLA. 

"Spending per pupil in 
California has declined from 
near the top among the 50 
states to 24th in the 1970s 
and students in California 
take fewer academic courses 
in high school than student 
in other states," Ki ss ler 
wrote. 

"I am afraid that the 
growing gap between a 
university of the highest 
standards and a below 
average system of public 
schools will ultimately result 
in rising attrition rollege 
dropout rates,"he said. 

"Democracy is dependent 
on a good education for the 
people who vote," Regent 
William Wilson said of the 
report. "Democracy lives or 
dies on the ability to educate 
people." 

The task fOrce report dealt 
in part with the changing role 
of the community colleges. 
The course\ifork in rommun-
ity rolleges has become more 
career-oriented, and the 
number of students transfer-
ring to UC campuses has 
declined sharply in the late 
197Os, Also, the dropout rate 
of community college 
transfers to the UC system 
nearly doubled from 1972 to 
1978, the task force reported. 

Because of pro-
duction problems, this 
issue will contain more 
than its share of typos. 
We apologize for any 
problems in reading 
they may cause.

· The Daily Gu..-dian Friday. October 17. 1980 

When !:ou need some 
notes atl:OOa.m.,you find out 

who your friends are. 

You left the notes for 
chapter 6 in the library. A sure 
sign that tomorrow's test will 
be heavy with questions from 
chapter 6. Someone you know 
is about to get a phone call. 
He's not going to like it, but he's 
going to come through. When 
this is over, do something 
special for him. Tonight, let it 
be Lowenbrau.
