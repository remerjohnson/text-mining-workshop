The lobsler has a simple ner-

rons. By studying a simple paucm. 
the researcher~ say they hope to 
uncover the key to how more com-

function. 

Nerve cells act like an electri -
cal system. A wave of electricity, 
termed an "acti on potential ," trav-
els down the neuron as a ~e sult of 
varying concentrations of sodium 
and potassium ions. At the end of 
the nerve cell. the action potential 
forces the release of a neurotrans-
miller into the synapse, Ihe micro-
scopic space between ce lls. 

The neurolransmiller bonds at 
the urface of the neighbori ng ce ll , 
produci ng another aClion pOlen-
tial. The signal is Ihus passed fur-

Sclverslon approached the prob-

"[The multi -disciplinary aspect] 
of Ihis work creales a kind of syn-
ergy that you wouldn ' t have with

The cooperation between the 
sciences i s somethin g th at 
Selverston says opened the door-

~ay for their current work. 
The inclusion of physicislS in 

the project exposed biologists to 
the mathematica l Iheory behind 
electrical ci rcuits. Usi ng these pri n-

ci ple~, they have been able to de-
ri ve several simple equations to 
describe the way nerve pathways 
funclion .

6 OPINION 

CONNERLY: 
Regent's honor 
unfairly attacked 
Continued from page 4 
You can' t point to just one thing he 
sa id and say that 's what he "rea lly 
believed." King 's true beliefs are .. 
mailer of interpretal ion, and 

() nne rl y'~ interpretation of 
King's "I Have a Drea m" ~peec h i\ 
no les\ plausinle than ones made 
ny Iibera l ~ . 

While there is eV ldcm:e that 
King ~ upp{lncd at lea~t ~omc kind 
or affi rmatl vc action, there i, no 
cV ldence 10 ~ugge~t that he ,up-
ported the va~1 race- and gender-
na~ed spoil , ,y,tem in place today. 
According to King, affirmat ive 
ac ti on wa\ a tcmporary mea\ure 
needed to rectify a deploranle 
Icgacy of sfavery and government -
\p<lI1\ored discrimination again~t 
nlach. 

Certainly King did not expecl 
affirmative action to continuc 
indefinit cly . Hi ~ idea l was Ihe 
color-nlind society, so mething 
Ihal t(xlllY's "civil ri ght s" leaders 
oft en decry as impossinle. Who's 
more In step with K111g\ Vision '!

Cunniff: Well . he was

were a lot of changes ... 

What kind of changes?

to prett y much tran ' late every-

because we always play, but I 
think Vivienne's hav ing more fun 
now because she's playing less 
samples. Peoplc would go "Why 
isn't she playing piano? Why is

be playing various samples. Kate

How did you decide to have

he's a fri end of Daniel's, and 
she was in town whi le we were

We actually playcd a gig with

been making big reco rds, they've 
been making really tiny releases 
They don 'l want 10 be big. When 
we performed with them, they were 
still li ving in ew York, and basi-

Why did you tone down on 
the "gender themes" so

I don't know, thi s one's sort of a

DOUG PRAY'S IIHYPE!" 
Seattle stars kill rock in new documentary 

By Esther Yoon 
Hiatus Editor 

When di~c u ~~in g "Hype!," a 
documentary on Scali Ie \ corne-
and -gonc "grungc" mu, ic ,cenc, 
director Doug Pray u~u ­
ally add~ a disc laimer: 
"What I tell people IS. i I 
the idea of a Scali Ie 
musIc scene rcpul se~ 
you, you' ve gOlla go ~ec 
thiS movlc. \ :au se that '~ 
really what it 's ahout." 

"Hype!" takc~ a com-
prehensi ve. well-
researched look into the evolution of 
Seattle's music scene between 19l:!5 
and 1992. Beyond Nirvana. Pearl 
Jam and Soundgarden, the film digs 
into the roots and forerunners of 
what transpired internationally into 
"grunge." and the promOlers and 
individual artists who packaged and 
marketed the "Seattle sound." 

In an interview with the 
Guardian , Pray discussed his inspi-
ration. which transpired into the 
years of research and ed iting 
behind the documentary. 

"Hype!" will be screened at the 
Price Celller Theater at 8 p.m. next 
Tuesday, Feb. 25, as a part of the 
Guess Independent Film Tour. For 
information. ca ll 534-4022. 
GUlll'dian: What inspired you 
to do a documentary about 
Seattle? 

Pray: Steve Helvey, the producer, 
had the idea in 1992 - which really 
was when the scene in Seattle had 
already peaked, in terms of the 
world's media. He was just like, 

"Why I ~n ' t there a movie about Seat-
tle"" I had done Just a few music 
videos up there, and he fi gured that it 
was Ju, t enough to Ju~tify us gOing 
up there and ca lling some people. I 

my~e ll wa, ~ Ick of hear-
Ing ahout it. I was ~o tired 
of Seattle and the long 
hai r and the grun ge. I wa~ 
thlllking "no way, 

hecau ~c they ' re reall y 
cynica l ahout the cam-
era" medi a, and wh y 
would they want to be 
p,lckaged yet again '! 

So there began the project. and I 
did begin to start talking to my 
friends up there ahout it. And 

i n~ lead of ~ay il1g "No. get out of 
here," it was actually interesllng. It 

wa~ kind of the opposite. The peo-
ple up there were on of thirsty for 
something that would be different. 
People up there did reali/e that 
there wa~ a viable, amaling music 
scene. and the story of how it had 
happened between 19l:!5 to 1992, 
the story of how about 20 people 
and ahout five or ix bands came to 
change pop culture throughout the 
world, was a fascinating story. 

Whether the fad is dead or not 
isn ' t even important - it hap-
pened. Seattle was kind of the per-
fect case study of that kind of phe-
nomenon which happens in a lot of 
places, in a lot of different decade 
- it was jusl the classic Slory. How 
long did it take? Is the film dated? 

The secret to thi s movie was 
that it took a long time. The film's 
not dated, because there's no way it

could have come out earlier. The 
fad i~ dated, and I ex pec t and 
understand when people look at the 
poster and say, "Gi ve me a hreak." 
The idea of the~e pa~\Jng fads. how 
they hap[lCn and how t hey die. how 
they're hom 
Were you already familiar 
with the more obscure 
artists and producers 
involved with the scene at 
the time? 

I was kind of flllniliar and kind of 
not. I do have a long musical back-
ground, so I knew about half of the 
hands up there pretty well and I'd 
seen a lot of them play. But to be 

honC~I . 1 wasn' l a big fan of. say. Suh 
Pop hands. And that '~ ok - you 
don 't really have to he a fan to do a 
movie. It 's almost beuer to be an 
outsider. We could almost defend the 
fact that wc were not from Seattle, 
because people from Seattle were 
too d ose to it. It ju~t was a mailer of 
talking to them. and if they under-
stood the vision I had for thi movie. 

We just listened, and we talked to 
so many people like Charles Peter-
son (photographer), and we drove 
down to Olympia and talked to 
Calvin Johnson (the owner of K 
Records). Steve Fisk (music produc-
er) was a really early adviser, he was 
somebody I met in a bar one night, 
and he just totally went off. 
What makes the whole 
grunge thing any different 
from every other musical or 
artistic genre that gets 
exploited?

Cou rtesy 
Master Thief: Cli nt Eastwood s tars In "Absolute Power. · 

ABSOLUTE 
POWER 

Eastwood film disappoints fan 
By Dan Sweeney 
Senior Staff Wnter 

C hancc~ are, the 20th annl vcr-
sary of "Ahsolute Power" in 20 17 
wi ll not see a re-release of the 
film wi th digitally re-mastered 
effecI' and added stcne~ . That IS 
not to say, however, that some 
additional ~cenes wouldn' t do the 
film '>ome gOOd. Dc pite havlllg 
all the ingrethents necessary to be 
grea t, "Abso lute Power" ends up 
JUSI barely being good . 

The opening of the film finds 
master thief Luther Whitney 
(Clint Eastwood) robbing the 
mansion of Washington rich man 
Walter Sullivan. In the process C'f 
pocketing the valuables, he inad-
vertently witnesse an inebriated 
sexual encounter between Sulli -
van's young wife and the PresI-
dent (Gene Hackman). Things get 
out of hand, two secret service 
guys respond to cries for help 
with guns blazing, and - Oops! 
- 0 )' Mrs. Sullivan has been 
reduced to a fine red mi st. 

Whitney, conveniently hidden 
behind a one-way mirror during 
the entire incident, makes off with 
a key piece of evidence. Before 
long, everybody from the Pre i-
dent 's goons to police detective 
Se th Frank (Ed Harris) are on his 
tail because - goshdarnit - he's 
the prime su pect! Being a world-
renowned thief can really wreak 
havoc wi th a guy 's alibis . 

The set-up is fine, but from 

there the film doesn' t quite ca tch 
fire. Fo r starters, suspen seful 
~eque n cc~ are few and far 
between. and when they linally 
do roll around they lack urgenc y. 

The pseUdo-gripping scene 
midway through the film in which 
the cops - led by the Prc~ident 's 
underlill 'S - try to lure Whitney 
mto a trap I ~ supposed to be the 
epi sode that makes us fall over 
each other with excitement. but the 
payofr never materialiles. He 
escapes, as we knew he would, and 
the elaborate scene ends up being 
nothing more than a cheap thrill. 

Add to that a slew of incompe-
tent baddies. and you have a pret-
t y less- t han -thri 11 i ng thri lIer. 
Hackman wa~ an exquisite villain 
in "Un forgiven," bUI here he just 
comes off as an inept politician 
who docs little. 

Surpri ingly, Eastwood and 
Hackman never interact , so a 
potentially great face-off is never 
realized. We have to settle for a 
nice li tt le scene in which Harris 
and Easlwood share coffee and 
engage in a li ttle verbal cat-and-
mouse. a la the famed DeNiro-
Pacino cafe scene in "Heat." It 's a 
nice moment, bul in this case 
hardly the heavy-hilling Sluff one 
expects from the genre. 

The only way I could get the 
bad taste oul of my mouth was by 
rushing home 10 Walch "Unforgiv-
en" on video. It 's whal "Absolute" 
could have been, bul wasn'l.

premiere of playwright Tina 
Howe's "Pride's Cross ing," 
directed by Jack O'Brien. 

The play focuses on the excit-
ing li fe of Mabel1idings Bigelow, 
who in 1928, at the age of 19, 
broke the world record for swim-
ming across the English Channel. 
Defying social barriers, her tri-
umph came during an era when 
women were supposed to be seen 
and not heard. 

The audience witnesses this 
momentous achievement through 
the musings of the 91 -year-old 
Bigelow as she reflects upon the 
pasl through vibrant flashbacks. 
Retracing her life with family, 
friends, children and lovers, she 
paints a captivating portrait of life 
in the early 19OOs. 

As Bigelow refl ects, the cast 
change~ roles, reg ressi ng (0 the 
characters of her past. In each 
stage of her lif.!. a cOlllplex histo-
ry unfolds as an aged woman 
leads us through her his tory. 

In thi s latest work by play-

wright Howe, we sec more than the 
lribute to one woman 's personal 
accomplishment. "Pride 's Cro s-
ing" is based upon the journey of 
all women who stood up to social 
pressures and found their trength 
from within. 

Cherry Jones gives a remark-
able performance as Bigelow. 
Leading the way, she effectively 
maintains her roles as both a 
young, ambilious woman and a 
nearly deaf, bedridden old 
woman. At times her portrayal of 
an elderly woman is all too vivid. 

Through the usc of new age 
music and a carefully constructed 
set, the transition from the present 
to the past flows quite smoothly. 
As Bigelow steps back in time, 
the audience is swept away by the 
use of shadows and music. 

Ovcrall , the artistic direction 
adds a strong clement to the play, 
buuressing the concept that the 
~tory of thi s one woman tran-
scends time. Her story of hoth tn -
umph and tragedy refl ect the 
experience~ of all women, past 
and present. 

"Pride's Crossing" runs until 
March 2.

What's the worst thing 
about any form of music 
being overly hyped? 

I don 't really think it was totally a 
bad thing. I wouldn't say that what 
happened in Seattle was totally 
awful . The movie definitely suggests 
that, hut the real ad ness behind hyp-
ing is the loss of community. I don't 
feel sorry for the hmld~. On the other 
hand. whenever anything IS diSCOV-
ered, there is always a price to pay. I 
don' t look at Suh Pop and think 
they're had for promoting the scene,

Jam are had because they got shot to 
the top. Frankly, both of tho e bands 
wanted to be successful to some 
degree. I think Sub Pop is great. I 
don' t think they really thought it 
would get so out of hand. If they 
hadn't done whalthey did, then none 
of those bands would have ever been 
heard. and maybe we'd still be lis-
tening to Madonna aillhe time. 

I think it's more JUS! a geneml 
fact - and there' nothing you can 
do about it - that art is great, and 
then it 's di scovered, and then it 
alTects the art. In this case, it really 
affected the whole community.

"Las Vegas is a place where

"Fools Rush In " 
whieh opened on

tells the story of two 
supposed ly " fated"

risky game of love. 

Matthew Perry (of "Friends") 
stars a Alex Wittman, a prag-
matic, straight-laced New York 
night clu b developer who arri ves 
in Las Vegas completely focused 
on hi s work. Salma Hayek plays 
Isabe l Fuentes, a pass ionate 
Mexican-American photograph-
er who believes in the power of 
destiny. 

A night of passion between 
the two ensues, which re~ ul t. In 
I. abel's pregnancy and a w dden 
marri age proposal. 

As newlyweds, Alex 
and Salma mu~t over-
come the obstacles that

On top of these challenges 
are the usual trial s and tribula-

CLOSE: Ahead by three in the eighth inning, UCSD rounds 
out a tough two-game road trip with a 7-6 to S to Concordia 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

l oe DiMagg io, Babe Ruth , l ae ki e 
Robinson and Willie Mays have pl aces re-
served nOI just in Ihe Baseball Hall of Famc 

ing a very positive lirst inni ng \l end they 
have been developing - bomb the tarter 
and gel an early big lead . Aga inst Bio la they 
• cored four in the first and aga inst Concordia 
Ihey put three on Ihe board . 

Geo rge Washin gton led a new nation

swimming and diving team 
fo ll owed Ihe tradi t ion of 
American greatn ess by con-
linu ing to qualify athleles for 
the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionsh ip Meet. 

Among those who swam well were Kelly 
Byrne in the 200-yard Indi vidu al Medley, 
Shawna Caball ero in the 50-ya rd frees tyle 
and Li nda Monroe in the 400-yard Indi -

person who transcended the 
ga llll' was Yankee great Yogi

two prev ious relief appearances. Although 

The Tritons traveled 10 Long Beach to 
parti cipate in the NCAA Wes te rn Confer-
ence meet. Swimm ing aga insl some of the 
top squ ads in. the West, UCS D had an ex -
tremely successful weekend . BOl h the men 
and women finished in the ame posi tion -
fo urth pl ace. 

"All in a ll we had a reall y good meet," 
Trilon Head Coac h Doug Boyd said. 

The T ritons' pr imary objective wa~ nut 
to wi n the conference meet, hut to quali fy as 
many swimmers as pos.iblc fur the champi -
onship meet. For some leams, this could 
have p rc~ented a pres~u re-fi ll ed ~itua lion . 
But the Tri lons, who will he ~endi ng a full

"The girls did n' t have a lot of rre,~u re

The women have qualified 18 swi mmers 
for the championshi p meet. bUI CAA regu-
lati ons permi t onl y 17 to attend Ihe eyent. 
This leaves Coach Boyd with Ihc tllugh 

d eci~io n of deciding who wi ll trave l to Ohio 
in March. 

As for Ihe men. three more swi mmers 
qualilied forthecham pionships. Mark Bei ter 
will swim the 20D-yard . 500-yard and 1650-

10D-yard breaststroke, while freshman 
phcnom Kent Wehde wi II partici pate in both 
the 200-yard and 400-yard ind ividual med -

The Triton men have 13 swi mmers with

alU rday thc Trilons were up hy as much as

Eagles, 7-6, m II innings. 

Yesterday, the Tritons were once again 
on the road, aga in doing bailie against the 

Eagh.:~ of Concordia Universi ty. UCSD led

that and ~hu t Concordia down for the next 
four innings. Whi Ie Wi lIi s was domi nating, 
the Tritons got a run in the sixth and another 
in the eighth to make it 5-2. 

Then came the di sastrous bollom of the 
eighth . Will is continued 10 bail ie the Eagle 
hitters, bul he was tiri ng. He allowed two 
runs. but he also fought for two outs. 

Fl etcher th e n in se rt ed Yos haya h 
Goldfarb. The freshman faced two balters 
and both of them reached base. Fletcher then 
wen I with l ohn Gherini. Wilh the bases 
loaded, Gherini gave up a three-run double. 
After the storm, Gherin i did get the Tritons 
out of Ihe inning. 

In the LOp of the ninth, the Tri lons rall ied. 
T hree 'onsec ut ive hit s b}l George 
Escanllelas, lon Goldsmith and Ryan Hill 
produt:ed a run , CUlling it 10 7-6, but that wa 
all the Tritons could muster. 

Rega rd less o f thei r two tough losses, the 
Tritons remain upbeat for their big game 
with hapman on Satu rday. 

" We ha ven' t heen overmatched [by Biola

Division I Streak Ends in Lion's Lair 
ALAS: The UCSD men's volleyball team's incredible two-game winning streak again t top Divi. ion I squad. fi nally came to 
a clo e as they traveled to Loyola Marymount University and dropped the match in three straight game, 12- 15, 6- 15, 5- 15 

CIDirC Schneider/ Guardian 

By Steve Walsh 
Co·Assoclate Sports Editor 

It i ~ ~ald that all good thlng~ must 
come to an end . 

On Tuesday I1Ight . the CS D 
men' ~ volleyball team 
~aw its two-matc h 
winning weak broken 
at Loyo la Marymount 
Uni ve r\ lt y. Coming 
off upset wln~ against 
No. 10 . • and o. 
<) Long Beach State, 
the Tntons sa\ their 

dominance of DI VI\lOn l opponenh 
end at the hands of the LIOns. 

FollOWing two of the most hls-
tonc wi n~ in UCS D vo ll eyball hi!o. -
tory , the Tn tom, were forced to 
leave the friendly c()nflne~ of 
RIMAC and trave l north to Lm 
Angele\ 

Again\! SC and Long Beach 
State, CS [) had been ab le to u\e 
a voca l home crowd and tremen -
dou!o. scrambling defen\e to force 
t he match to a fi fth game where 
the Tnton~ were able to use their 
sideout kills to win the match . 
But again~t Loyola Marymount . 

' SD was never able tn turn the 
tide. and wa~ elimi nated in three 
straight ga mes. 

fir~t game ~aw CSO usc Its aggre!o.-
\ Ive offe n~e to ~ t ay c1o~e to It~ taller 
opponent~ . 

With Junior opposi te hiller Jon 
Yarri~ leading the way with 17 
klll~ for the match. the Tri ton~ 
converted over 40 percent of their 
kill oppo rtunlll e~ In the first game. 

nfortunately lor CSD, the LI-
() n ~ were able to mai ntain and In -
crea~e thl~ pace th roug hout the 
match . 

DC!o.plte ~ tay lng c1o~e through the 
fiN game. the Tri ton!o. were unable 
to replicate the heroic effom ofthei r 
prevlou\ matche\ and Loyola 
Marymount took the game, 15-12. 

A~ the t eam~ ~wi tc hed ~ Ide .. , 
UCSD 10M any momentum that it 
:'ad from the rir~ t game. While the 
Triton~ had been able to ~ tay close in 
the fir!o.t game, the !o.econd ~aw Loyola 
Marymount !lex It~ mu 'c1e and show 
It, dominance. 

Agaln ~t S and Long Beach. 
CSD had'been able to usc it~ ag-
gre~sive jump ~ervi ng to keep its 
bigger opponents on their hee ls. 
Fm:lI1g the LlOn~. the normally reli-
able ser ing of the Tritons did not 
produce. with the team logging 15 
service error ... eight more than their 
hOMS. 

started , the Lion offense continued 
to heat up while the Triton attack 

wa~ reduced to a simmer. This wa 
a reci pe for di saster for UC 0 , as 
Loyola Marymount dominated the 
,econd game. 15-6. 

For the Tritons, the problem~ of 
game two were not to be overcome 
In the third. Again, the Lion attack 

wa~ too much for UCSD to handle 
and by the time the smoke cleared. 
Loyola Marymount had four play-
e r~ In double figures for kill s and a 
15-S vlclory to win the match. 

Del,pite the l os~, the Tri tons did 
get some good news. They were 
ranked n. 2 In DiVision I!I and 
recei ved vo te~ in t he most recent 

Divi~ion I poll. To be mentioned In 
the Divi~lon I poll ~how~ the re~pect 
that the UCSD program now re -
ceives following its two previous 

wl n~ . 
The Tritonl, wi ll have to rebound 

from their letdown again~t the Li -
ons before their next match agai nst 
the ni ve rsi ty of La Verne at 
RIMAC on Friday. CSD is look-
ing to avenge an earli er loss to the 
Leopard,>, with whom they arc bJt -
tling 10 represent the West Coa~t at 
the Di vi~ion III ati nal Champi -
onships. 

Up and Over: UCSD captain Jon Yarris (2) recorded 17 kills 
aga inst Loyola Marymount University in a three-game defeat. 

The Tntons opened the match 
playing the same t pe of vo lleyball 
that had allowed them to upset their 

prev l ou ~ l y ranked opponents. The 

Without their normall y ~trong 
\e rvll1g game. UCSD wa~ forced to 
go head-to-head With the Loyo la 
Marymount alt<ll:k. As game two 

"La Verne was the worst match 
that we have played this year by 
far," Yarri s sa id." ow we ' re look-
Ing to put the pre sure on them."
