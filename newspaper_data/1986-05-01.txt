UCSB chancellor 
accused of dishonesty 

University of California 
President David Gardner has 
responded to a letter from nine 
UC Santa Barbara faculty 
members who suggested that 
Chancellor Roben Hunenback 
consider resigning. 

Gardner's lener stated that he 
would not formally meet with 
members of UCSB's faculty until 
they confer with Huttenback. 

In the faculty members' lener, 
nine key Academic Senate 
officers outline a number of their 
concerns about Huttenback's 
ability to govern the university. 
The letter represented the 
opinions of the professors, not 
the Academic Senate . 

The half-page correspondence 
to the president outlined in 
vague terms a number of key 
issues affecting the campus 
community. Included were the 
chancellor's abilities in fiduciary 
responsibility, judgement 
priorities and effectiveness in 
academic maners, stewardship of 
the UCSB Foundation - the 
university development branch 
- alienation of student leadets 
and "diminished capacity to 
provide the moral authority to 
lead and represent the campus." 

"If there are complaints, no 
one from the Academic Senate or 
any of its committees has ever 
come to me to voice those 
complaints," Huttenback said 
Thursday. 

,....-------, 

The chancellor is expected to 
release a statement today to 
address his alleged misuse of 
funds, which are reponedly 
invested in his home. Sources 
confirm that thousands of dollars 
were charged to university 
accounts to pay for 
improvements i ii the Huttenback 
home. 

Huttenback said the 
systemwide administration was 
aware of the expenditures and 
he justified the use of funds . He 
said he entenained many people 
at his residence on behalf of the 
university. 

ACLU addresses laws 
and civil liberties 

Ira Glasser, executive director 
of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU), will deliver the 
DeWitt Higgs lecture at this

May 2 lecture titled "Law 
Enforcement and Civil Liberties: 
We Can Have Both," is free and 
open to the public . 

Glasser's lecrure will be held 
Friday, May 2 at 8 pm in UCSO's 
Peterson Hall. A public reception, 
hosted by the San Diego Chapter 
of the ACLU, will be held 
immediately following.

Ventilation problems resulted in a delay in the : construction of 
the ne'N elevator for the Muir Biology Building, according to 
spokespersons trom Facilities, Construction and Design. 

"There was a problem with the fumes from the construction 
eqUipment geaing into the air," Chuck Powers, assistant vice-
chancellor of Facilities, Construction and Design said Friday. ·We 
set up a bypass for air supply to draw air from each end of the 
building," he said. 

The one-week delay was "no big deal ," Powers said . "We just 
wanted to assure ourselves of the solution," he commented. 

The second elevator, financed by private funds , is being built in 
the Muir Biology Building to relieve the load of the existing elevator. 
"(The project) provides a second elevator in this busy major lab 
bUilding to relieve the existing single elevator," a spokesperson 
from Resource Management said.

UCSD demonstrator arrested 
By NONIE GANAKIS, Contributing News Editor 

ANTI-WAR demonstrations began last Thursday at UCSD and 
escalated after the arrest of 
UCSD student Arnie Schoenberg 
on Tuesday. 

Schoenberg was charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon 
and malicious mischief 
(vandalism), shortly before noon . 

Anti -war protestors from UC 
Berkeley and UClA made a "call 
for action" on Tuesday asking 
that all concerned students of 
UC campuses demonstrate 
against U.S. foreign policy in 
Central America , Lib}"l and South 
Africa. 

Since Thursday, April 24, 
approximately 25 UCSD students 
have been occupying the Career 
Services Center specifically to 
protest the on-campus militaty 
recruitment by the ClA, FBI , INS 
(Immigration and Naturalization 
Service), and funher use of 
student fees to fund such 
services. 

Intended to be a form a 
protest against military 
recruitment on campus, 
Schoenberg, an anti-war 
demonstrator, threw a bucket of 
red paint on an ROTC table in 
Revelle Plaza , splattering ROTC 
literature, 2 ROTC recruiters and 
a flag , said campus police. 

Schoenberg apparently ran 
from the table to the front of 
USB, where he was confronted 
by one of the recruiters . He then 
reponedly turned and swung at 
the recruiter with what was 

thought to be a lead pipe, 
according to Lt. J Dyer of the 
UCSO police . 

Yesterday, detective Sergeant 
Bob Jones of campus police 
disclosed information that the 
metal object now "appears 10 
have been a metal type of 
musical instrument," and went 
on to sa y that "any object, a 
stapler. etc ., used in the proper 
fashion , can be assault with a 
deadly weapon." 

Sue Spalding, a fellow anti-war 
activist , said that the "supposed 
lead pipe was Arnie 's penny 
whistle (flute)," and that "the 
bucket of paint was more like a 
cup ." 

"My action was a 1l0litical one 
intended to raise the issue or 
militarization on this campus 
and in the world ," Schoenberg 
said. "I meant no harm to any 
individual nor did I threaten 
them physicaUy. 1 merely 
threatened their ideology," he 
said . 

"The red paint is meant to 
symbolize the military's pan in 
the slaughtering of hundreds of 
thousands in Central America 
and Libya," Spalding said. 

Schoenberg continued to flee 
until he entered the Che Cafe , 
where he was arrested and taken 
to the campus police station. 

From the station , Schoenberg 
was taken to the county jail, 
because, according to Dyer, 
"assault with a deadly weapon is 
a felony and can only be 
processed downtown ." 

According to a police repo~t , 
Schoenberg dropped the metal 
object somewhere berween USB 
and the Che Cafe. At 2:30 am 
Wednesday morning, Schoenberg 
was charged with a felony and 
released after friends posted the 
bail set dt $3,100. Schoenberg 
could not be released on his own 
recognisance because of the 
felony charge. 

Approximately 15 
demonstrators marched to the 
UCSD Police Station , blocked 
both the front and back 
entrances and demanded the 
release of Schoenberg on 
Tuesday at 2:45 pm. OlTicers 
esconed Schoenberg OUt a side 
door. 

The anti-war activists joined 
other protestors at the Career 
Services Center shonly after 
Schoenberg'S departure . 

The 25 protestors in the Lobby 
of the Career Services Center, 
sat-in, sang and chanted anti-
war jingles until 4:30 when the 
bUilding closed and all persons 
were ordered by Dyer to leave or 
be charged with trespaSSing. 

Four uniformed campus police 
officers, under the command of 
Dyer, began to carry the 
remaining 15 protestors, one by 
one out the front entrance of the 
building. 

One "female protestor was 
dragged out of the building by 
her backpack, causing the 
enraged crowd to exclaim cries 
of "pig" and "UCPD backs white 
supremacy." ~

Ruinous obstinancy 
We learn much too slowly. Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki we hav~ known in . 

graphic terms the destructive po~ential of nuclear energy. We have tned to hamess the 
power of atom-splitting for practlcal use ; ho~~~er, the energy that we have 
encountered is much too great for our capablimes. 

By now it should be obvious that we ar~ inventing our own d~ath . Whatever proud 
rush we have received from our technological accomphshrnents In the past, we must 
now realize that we have overcome our limits. 

A nuclear fire is burning and expanding just north of Kiev [Oday,. yet we soothe 
ourselves with the thought that the tragedy has overcome our enemies and not our 
families. We endanger ourselves and the intemational community, but even when such 
a disaster occurs we still contend that we are safe. More than 2,000 people are dead 
and more than 10,000 are hospitalized, but we still believe that we are right in 
inventing machines that we cannot. manag~ . . . .. 

Worse than showing simple obstmancy In our de~lslons, we ~ommue t~ Judge 
manifestations of universal problems in terms of Soviet or ~encan pa:adlgms. We 
think that the nuclear reactors in this country are technologically supenor to and free 
from the problems of those in Chemobyl; we rest easily thinking that their town . 
exploded, and we forget that we have ~id f~r ourselves the same tr~ps .that w~re laid 
in the Soviet Union. Our pride has agam dnven us [0 Ignore a crucLallssue With 
which we aU struggle. . . .. 

The events of this week should have been an educatIOn m the makmgs of tragLc . 
circumstances. For many, it is instead another opponuniry t? argue that the U .S.~.R IS 
more vulnerable than the United States. We are also susceptIble to such destructIon. 

How many more times will we need to see utter ruin before ~~ admit to our~lves 
that we have not controlled our technology? How many more cltles must we pOlson 
with radiation before we begin to fight the hazards with which nuclear technology 
presents us? . , .. . '11 

Tomorrow we will receIve the reSidue of the Chemobyl explOSIOn. Our CIties WI not 
be destroyed. Most likely, none of us will ever be able to tell that we have taken i~ . ' 
more radioactive particles than usual. But we must not forget that such an explOSIOn IS 
a danger here as well. We should not .have to learn to prot~ct our~lves by seeing orner 
people die. But now that we have agam seen what devastation awaits us, we must at 
least take the initiative to avoid that end.

Qarter'til 

'ADlerican DrealIls' 
By PHIL W1LLON 

W HO ARE the Americans? I'd have to say it really depends upon who you ask. I'm sure that an 18-year-old unwed mother of twO would have a different answer than 
an average UCSD student living in University City, a w,est German 
protestor or a Libyan refugee. I've lived in Southern Californlamost 
of my life and I have a g~ idea of what it's like bei~ a San Dlegan 
and a Californian - but I m still not sure about what It means to be 
an American. 

I see Iranians burning American Oags, Lib~ns sacrificing their 
lives to kill Americans, and 7-year-old Nicaraguan children 
chanting "death to the yankee" slogans. An~ I re.alize that these are 
not recent trends - this has been happemng sm~e the begmmn.g 
of the century. Americans are nearsighted when It comes to their 
inDuence on the rest of the world. They are so nearsighted, in fact, 
that small nations reson to extreme measures to have their voices 
heard in the face of unfair situations. The current hostility toward 
our country is the delayed cost of the benefits of enterprising 
American excavation from the world in the past. 

The U nired States is a great country. It is wealthy in both natural 
and human resources. Its principles of freedom and democracy are 
admirable, but we are running out of room. We are suc,h a small 
people yet we use such a large ponion of the worl~ s natural 
resources. Our wealth is compensated by someone else ~ poveny. 
You see Americans. being killed today - who was being ki~ed 
yesterday? Or don't we care? It is hypOCritical for a nati~n that ttled 
to poison Fidel CaStro and initiated a plot to assassinate South 
Viemam's Ngo Dinh Diem to condemn acts of terronsm only now 
when it is the victim of terrorist acts. _ 

When, over 200 years ago, a group of scrappy colonialists 
decided to create a nation based on the ideals that everyone has 
certain unalienable rights (including life, libeny, and the pursuit of 
happiness) they never said those rights were meant o~y for the 
citizens of the United States. They never said that those nghts could 
be twisted at the convenience of the government either. America 
revolted against England to escape political and economic 
domination, to create a nation where everyone was equal under the 
law in spite of their differing beliefs and ethnicities. . . 

Today America has become a commodity. It 15 selling 1t~lf and It 
is buying itself. Aagwaving stereotypes us as white, male, 
middleclass consumers, and it endangers the world's only haven for 
all people of aD nations. There is no o~e American ~y or people -
that is our power. We must not redefme freedom .m terms of profit 
or majority beliefs. We must be cntlcal of our nation. The. freedom 
to be a critical minority is precisely what makes us Amencans. ~

Revived apathy 
Editor: 

laSt Thursday (April 24), the 
ReveDe College Council 
sponsored an open forum to 
address the recently proposed 
parking rate increase. The 
proposal, which would increase 

the -fees of students, staff and 
faculty by 26 percent, 20 percent 
and 17 percent respectively, 
comes as a direct result of debts 
incurred by the financing of the 
UCSD Medical Center's Bachman 
Canyon parking structure 
downtown. For those of you who 
remember last year's fee increase, 
you will recall that it was due to

that vel)' same problem; that is, 
the financing of the Med 
Center's parking structure. You 
see, the building of this structure 
was facilitated by a loan, rather 
than a builiding bond , the end 
result· of which being that we 
incur a debt service of over $1 
miUion annuaUy on the principal 
alone. So much for creative 
finanCing. 

Parking directors Bob Umstead 
and Laura Rey were invited to 
the parking fourm to discuss the 
problem with students and to 
clarify cenain issues re~rding 
the Parking Committee's role in 
the increase . George Hime, the 
asst. vice chanceUor for business 
affairs, was also invited . 

~n~o~nately, ~hey decline.d the 
inVitatiOn, oITenng to appear 
sometime after May 5. 

A question: Why another 
increase? And funhermore, for 
the exact same reason as last 
year's? Laura Rey had told 
students that there would be no 
more parking increases for the 
next/ive years. ("Midyear parking 
fee hike," The Guardian, 
11 / 12/84). Funhermore, the 
minutes of the Parking 
Committee's meeting of 
10/22/84 speCifically outline a 
leveUing-oIT of parking fees 
through spring 1989. 

Another question: The 
students were promised that the 
structure would be refinanced. 
Why has this not been done? 

' •• 

And anOther: Students were 
told that alternative funding 
sources, such as Bookstore 
revenue surplus, would be 
investigated ('''Surprise' fee 
increase ... ," The Guardian , 
11 / 26/ 84). Why hasn't this been 
done? 

And yet one more. and this 
one is probably the most 
profound question of aU: Do you, 
the student, care that your fees 
are being increased? If you don 't. 
you needn 't continue reading; 
I'm waSting my breath . If, on the 
other hand , you do take an 
active interest in your affairs, 
why don't you show it? The 
response to the parking forum 
was minimal (and this 
euphemistically.) Why? NOt due 
to advenising (The Guardian, 
Revellations. and the Community 
Center aU advenised.) Those 
people who did attend the forum 
were not the least bit interested; 
besides queStions from forum 
members, there was only one 
question from the audience, and 
this concerned the building of 
Muir's Bio Building elevator! I do 
realize there was a rally on 
campus at the same time. I was 
there 15 minutes after the 
parking forum began (that is, 
when the parking forum ended). 
Aside from co-op members who 
had sponsored the 
demonstration, there were very 
few people there; cenainly not as 
many as there could have been 
Oesse Jackson brought out over 
3000 people). 

People consistently come to 
me and ask why it is that they 
neYer hear anything from their 
local governments; why they 
consistently "get road-rolled" by 
the upper administration; why 
they don't have a voice in what 
happens on campus. They say, 
"Well , it's too late now, but we'll 
chalk it up to experience. We'll 
be ready next time!" As they did 
last year. And the year before . 
And the year before that. Come 
on , folks, get a clue! The old 
bromide "You can't ger 
something for nothing" is quite 
true. "The administration" may 
"road-roll" the students, as a 
friend of mine is fond of 
propounding, but they won't 
know that the students really 
give a damn unless the students 
take an interest in what's going 
on around them. 

Anyway, your fees are being 
increased . I just thought you 
might want to know.

A SUDSy image 
EdUor: 

I feel that it is about time to 
clear up some misunderstandings 
that have been floating around 
lately concerning the elections in 
general and the S.U.D.S. slate in 
panicular. This slate has been 
perceived by many as being the 
new indicator and radical slate. It 
is not. I m specifically referring 
to the letter written by Bill Eggers 
to the Guardian (4/26), which 
seemed to imply how our slate 
huns the causes of "groups like 
BSU, MEChA, etc." That Mr. 
Eggers is referring to the S.U.D.S. 
slate can only be inferred by how 
our slate has been associated 
with both the n.i. and the various 

SAAC constituency organizations, 
but prrdominantly with the 
former. I am surr these 
organizations appreciate Mr. 
Eggers' concern, but if they feel 
in any way minimized or hun, I 
am confident that they will speak 
for themselves, as they always 
do. 

What students must be aware 
of when they vOte and judge the

As far as the other slates are

an oxymoron to me), it is 
imponant to note that two of the

Potluck and two from the slate of

exactly who makes up the slates 
and what they stand for.

Ending the frustration of infertility 
By STEVE TATRO. Staff Writer 

SUE AND JOHN DAVIS' greatest dream has always been to have children, to 
nunure their 0}Vl1 offspring from 
infancy to adulthood. The 
Davises bought a three-bedroom 
house, looking forward to the 
day when its hallways would be 
filled with voices other than their 
own. 

Yet after six years of 
frustration , this young couple is 
afraid that their dream will 
always be just a dream, but then 
they heard about the Fenility 
Center of California. 

The Davis' doctor told them 
about the possibility of anificial 
insemination at the Fenility 
Center, and the next day the 
DaVlSes called to make an 
appointment for consultation 
with their expens there . 

The Fenility Center of 
California, previously called 
Sperm Bank Incorporated, is 
located in Santa Ana and is one 
of fewer than 30 facilities 
nationwide that specialize in 
increasing human fertility 
through sperm management and 
artificial insemination . Since its 
conception in 1981, when 
founder Herlinda Sullivan was 
the center's only employee, the 
business has grown to employ 
nine people full time . 

knowledge that his sperm count 
is fewer than 20 million per 
milliliter, compared with an 
average of around 180 million 
per milliliter for most men. 
Faced with this deficiency, the 
center can offer the Davises 
three options. 

First, they can choose to pod 
a large amount of John's sperm, 
storing it temporarily in liquid 
nitrogen, then washing it of 
impurities to increase its motility, 

and then attempting to 
inseminate Sue with the pooled 
and washed sperm. n1is 
procedure is very expensive and 
offers the Davises only a 5 to 15 
percent chance for pregnancy, 
but it is the only method 
available that, if Sue becomes 
pregnant, will ensure that the 
resulting child is genetically 
"their own." 

The second possibility is to 
use the sperm of a donor, who 

has been genetically screened . 
and matched as closely as 
possible to the Davises, to 
anificiaUy inseminate Sue . This 
procedure costs only about one-
third of the pooling and washing 
technique, and offers the Davises 
an 80 percent chance of 
pregnancy within three 
repetitions. 

The Davis' third option is to 
attempt to inseminate Sue with a 
mixture of John's sperm and that 

of a donor. The likelihood of 
pregnancy with this procedure is 
about the same as if only donor 
sperm Were used, and it is only 
slightly more expensive than 
insemination with pure donor 
sperm. But what appeals to the 
Davises most about the sperm 
mixture procedure is the 
possibility that the child 
engendered by it might be John's 
genetiC offspring, while it will 
cenainly be Sue's. 

After deciding to go ahe~d 
with the donor/husband mIxed 
sperm insemination, the Davises 
first fill out a number of forms to 
determine their genetic 
backgrounds based on their 
physical characteristics and 
family histories. There is also a 
form stating that the Davises 
formally accept as their own any 
child begotten byanificial 
insemination involving donor 
sperm, and another absolving the 
Fenility Center from 
responsibility for any possible 
birth defects, although their 
incidence is rare , due to the 
rigorous screening of all parties 
involved. 

Next, a suitable donor must be 
found . This is done by the 
experts at the Fertility Center, 
who select one of their 33 
donors who is best matched 
physically and geneticaUy to the 
Davises. 

The center's donors go 
through even closer physical and 
genetic examination than the 
couple requesting the 
insemination, and are selected 
on the basis of phYSical features , 
intelligence and good-
naturedness. 

The identi ties of the donors 
Please tum to page 7 

During a long, frank 
consultation with Sullivan, the 
Davises learned that hundreds of 
couples have had children with 
the .help of the Fertility Center, 
but that there is no guarantee 
that anificial insemination will 
result in pregn. ancy. The Davises 
also learned that there could be 
several reasons for rheir 
infenility: Maybe John's sperm 
has a low count or poor motility, 
or possibly Sue's Fallopian tubes 
are obstructed or tangled , it is 
even remotely possible that there 
has never been intercourse when 
Sue has been ovulating, which is 
the only time when conception 
is possible . 

A showing off of UCSD 
In order to determine the 

reason or reasons for the Davis' 
infenility, several tests are 
performed to evalu::te the 
reproductive systems of both 
husband and wife . 

Sue's laparascopy, a procedure 
inVOlving the insertion of a 
fiberoptic laser through the navel 
to examine the FaUopian tubes, 
ovaries and uterus, discovers no 
abnormalities. But John's semen 
analysis yields the sad

In the two weeks follOwing her 
insemination, Sue went through 
18 home pregnancy detection 
kits. One time the kit showed a 
color that is almost the same as 
·pregnant blue," but Sue 
discovers she has used chemical 
number three instead of number 
two. 

As the Davises realized that 
they are not going to be parents 
jUst yet, John pointed out that 
although the total cost of the first 
insemination, including 
consultation, was $600, each 
subsequent insemination will 
cost less than $200, which they 
can afford for several months to

come. After their next 
insemination the Davises are 
more guarded in meir 
enthusiasm, but there was no 
reason to be, because this time 
Sue is pregnant, and a bouquet of 
flowers is immediatelr sent to 
the Fenility Center 0 
California. fi3 are kept confidential, and payment of $30 is made for each 

usable semen sample . A sample 
must be a sinlde ejaculate 
produced exc[usively by 
masturbation after two or three 
days of sexual abstinence and 
delivered to the center in a 
sterilized glass container within 
one hour of production. It is 
often most convenient to 
produce samples at the center 
itself, where the lockmg 
bathrooms are equipped with 
sterile jars as well as P/a)boy and 
Penthouse magazines. 

which measures the surge in 
human luteinizing hormone that 
occurs just prior to ovulation. 
The bright blue color of the 
Ovustick confirms Sue's 
ovulation. 

As Sue's third measured 
ovulation approaches, the 
Davises abstain· from intercourse 
so that when the day of 
ovulation comes, John wil be able 
to produce a usable sperm 
sample to mix with that of the 
selected donor. John chose not 

Opening up the house 

Timing is the crucial factor in 
performing an anificial 
insemination, because the 
procedure must be performed 
wjthin 24 hours of the patient's 
ovulation. For this reason , Sue 
Davis keeps a careful record for 
three months prior to her 
insemination, using two methods 
to detect her exact day of 
ovulation. 

By measuring her body 
temperature every morning 
before gening out of bed, Sue 
uses the Basal Body Temperature 
Method to chan ovulation. A 
drop of about one-half of a 
degree Fahrenheit on a morning 
around the middle of her 
menstural cycle tells Sue that she 
is ovulating, and therefore fenile 
on that day and the follOwing 
one. 

Just to be sure , Sue uses an 
Ovustick ovulation detection kit, 

to freeze a sample in liquid 
nitrogen at the center, since this 
might further decrease the 
already low motility of his sperm. 

The sperm of the donor 
selected for the Davises is stored 
at the center, along with the 
semen of chemotherapy patients, 
radiation workers, vasectomy 
recipients and other men who, 
for one reason or another, are 
storing their sperm for possible 
future use. 

The day arrives; Sue is 
ovulating. At 9:30 John takes his 
sperm sample to the center in an 
oven-sterilized baby food jar and 
is informed that his wife may 
come in for insemination that 
afternoon. 

The insemination procedure is 
a simple one : The 
husband/ doncr sperm mixture is 
injected into the vagina and held 
in place· near the cervi l( by a 
small sponge. The entire process 
takes only half an hour.

Hard luck starter Frank Califano didn't receive much support as USD beat UCSD 8-2. 

more than one hit on the day, 
going two for three. 

Despite the loss, UCSD finds 
itself in a good position to pluck 
one of the [WO regional playoff 
spots for Division m. The 
Tritons' overan recorri is the best 
among the four tearns in 
competition for those [WO spots, 
with laVerne (21-18), Stanislaus 
(16-17-1) and Claremont (22-18). 

The Tritons ha~ [WO games 
remaining (after a game 
yesterday against Pt. Loma), a 
monstrously important double-
header against La Verne at La 
Verne this Saturday. 

"We're going to ha~ to play 
well," said Yates, "But we got a 
big boost this weekend when we 
learned that Mark Sloan, (a 
starter) is fully recovered . He's 

going to toss a couple innings 
against Pt. Lorna. I'd say he's 
thmwing the ball better now 
than he has at any time this 
year." Sloan, who was out of 
action for three weeks, will also 
pitch this weekend versus La 
Verne.

'Nomads tab two Tritons 
T WO UCSD SOCCER players, Joe Giaccalone and Alberto Gomez, ha~ 
made the final cuts for San 
Diego's Western Alliance 
Nomads, an amateur team that 
marks the rerum of outdoor 
soccer to San Diego. The league 
- made up of seven 
professional, semi-professional 
and amateur tearns from 
Edmonton, Seanle, Portland, San 
Jose , Hollywood, Los Angeles 
proper and the Nomads -
begins play May 18 when the 
Nomads take on the Earthquakes 
from San Jose at Balboa Stadium 
at 7 pm. 

The highlight of the team's 
;;eason includes games against 

Dundee, Scotland (May 27) and 
Manchester City, a Division I 
team in Great Britain (June 5). 
All home games will be played at 
Balboa Stadium. 

San Diego's entry is coached 
by UCSD soccer coach Derek 
Armstrong. "The great thing 
about this team is that it's made 
up equally of youth and 
experience," said Armstrong, 
"and college players like Joe and 
Alberto"make a great 
combination with \'rterans like 
Vidal and Leo." Vidal Fernandez 
and Leonardo Cuellar, both 
former Sockers, are also assistant 
coaches, along with Brian 
McMannis, who coached me 
Hollywood Stars, a 

championship, semi-pro ream the 
last two years. Cuellar, a m~mberof 
the Mexican National Tearit, is also, 
assistant coach for USIU. 

Questions about the eligibility 
of Giaccalone and Gomez are 
moot since the Nomads do not 
get any pay. According to 
Armstrong, both Giaccalone and 
Gomez are "Not violating any 
NCAA rules, and are in the final 
stages of clearance for the start 
of the season." 

Other members of the team 
include players of USA

year that we wouldn't normally

think you can attribute that to 
our lack of experience." 

Lack 01 experience is 
something La Plante will have to

Criminal activity at UCSD over 

the last two weeks: 
-Anhur "Skipp" Armson a 
UCSD student laS! quane~, was 
arraigned Tuesday for a felony 
hit-and-run incident hwich 
occurred March 6, injuring Yang 
Cheng Yang, a visiting scholar 
from China. Armson wa s also 
charged with burglarizing the 
Che Cafe. 
-Mari Yguerabide wa s arraigned 
Wednesday, charged with aiding 
and abening the felony hit and 
run. 
-Arnold Schoenberg, a current 
student here, was arrested 
Tuesday for assault with a deadly 
weapon. Schoenberg was 
protesting military recruitment at 
UCSD by throwing red paint on 
an ROTC booth at Revelle Plaza. 
After throwing the paint, 
Schoenberg was chased down by 
one of the reserves from the 
booth . Schoenberg then anegedly 
swung a flute he was carrying at 
the ROTC member. The flute is 
considered the "deadly weapon ." 
-A university van was stolen 
and recovered by the Broder 
Patrol. This was the school's 
third van theft in three weeks. 
All of the incidents involved the 
transponation of illegal aliens. 
"The undocumented alien influx 
into the United States is having 
an impact on crime on the 
UCSD campus and in the city as 
was identified by (San Diego 
Police Chief) Bill Kolender before 
the City Council: Sergeant 
Raben Jones of the campus 
police said . 
-Police arrested an iUegal alien 
for tampering with a vehicle on 
North Torrey Pines Road. 
-23 parking permits were 
reponed lost/stolen. 
-One motorcycle and two cars 
were stolen. 
-10 auto burglaries. 
-;:-A computer terminal valued at 
$1000 was stolen from POSS at 
Scripps. ~ 

Sun God 
Continued (rom page 1 

According to Smith, "There are 
four reasons why thr Sun God 
Committee solicited sponsors: to 
integrate the community with the 
festival ; to resolve accounting 
problems: to decrease expenses 
for the AS and other 
organizations; and to shift the 
focus of the festival from profit 
to charity." 

The format at the e\ICnt has 
changed drastically over the past 
three years. According to lizzy 
La Cagnina, director of the Sun 
God Festival, when Henry Choo 
was preSident of UCSD in '82-
'S3, the AS and Campus 
Recreation Department wanted to 
stan some ~ of major spring 
campus event, similar LO UCU's 
Mardi Gras. That same year, 
UCSD acquired the Sun God an 
piece by anist Niki de SI. PhaUe 
which determined the name and 
location of the feSli val. 

La Cagnina said that 1985 
went well . "We made $4,000 that 
year. It 5elVed its purpose and 
the anendance and panicipation 
were greater," she said . 

Next year, La Cagnina hopes 
that the festival will last for two 
days instead of one. "Hopefully, 
if the festival Is for two days we 
can also have rides," she said . 
This, she pointed Out , will be r,!'I 
difficult but benefi cial. !WI

First Annual 
Sun God Indoor Soccer Tournament 

If the number of requests by crazed soccer players is any indication, then 
the First Annual Sun God Indoor Soccer Toumament should be a smashing 
success, The 1M office has been flooded by many requests [Q have an indoor 
soccer toumament, It's either the tremendous success of the World 
Champion San Diego Sockers, the up and coming intercollegiate soccer 
team, or the growing number of soccer players in the intramural program, 
but the interest is unbelievable , 

The toumament will take place Saturday and Sunday May 10 & 11. All 
games will be played in the Rec Gym (Reckerdome). It will last all day, at 
least for those fortunate winners, The format will be single elimination with 
the championship games being played Sunday night. There will be four 
divisions; Men's Open division open to all players, Men's Limited division 
open to all who have not played intercollegiate or club soccer. Coed Open 
division to all , and Coed Umited division open to those who have not 
played intercollegiate or club soccer. Sign-ups are now being taken at the 
Canyonview Recreation Offices on a first come first served basis. The entry 
fee is 510.00 per team. Contact Scott Bemdes for more informaLion. 

Come on out and give it a try. Ste if you really are aJulie Vee or a Branko 
SegOta.

A Mexican celebration 
by dan palomino 

\'<.'ell , here we are again for 
round three - Spring! Spring 
may mean different things to 
different people, especially on 
the UCSD campus. Spring 
means the Sun God Festival, 
the Renaissance Faire, the 
watermelon drop off Urey 
Hall, outrageous weather, 
longer days, graduation and, 
of course, summer being just 
around the corner. But spring 
also means the annual Cinco 
de Mayo celebration. 

That is right, the Cinco de 
Mayo celebration is coming 
up, and better yet, it is going 
to be in conjunction with the 
T .G. that takes place on May 
1. (Yes, Cinco de Mayo means 
the fifth of May, but May 5th 
happens to be on a Monday 
this year and it would not 

:..IIIIII .. ----IIII!~, make much sense to have a 
T.G. on a Monday, now 
would it?) There ~ill be a lot 
happening, including the 
prepa ra tion of fantastic 
Mexican food. (What did you 
expect? Chinese?) 

Read on for a basic run~ 
down on the schedule of 
festivities. To find this event, 
just follow your nose (the 
food), or follow your ears (the 
music), or you can follow 
everyone else because you can 
be sure they are heading out to 
the Gym steps and Student

San Diego's English Pub 
Princess of Wales 
Eating the Princess 

It would be hard for me to sa y whether The Princess of Wales is a 
truly authentic English restaurant for two reasons. One,l have never 
been to England and two, it . is hard to sa y how well an ethnic 
restaurant in the United States can adhere to tradition and still be 
successful. Still, one can judge a restaurant of this sort by its c1ientel. 
Much in the sa"\e way that many Asians in a Chinese restaurant 
(excluding the staff) are a good sign, many English in The Princess of 
Wales is a good indication that, while it may not be exactly like an 
English pub, it certainly is the closest thing·in San Diego. 

The Princess of Wales is named after the Princess of Wales. This 
concept is punctuated by the dozens of pictures of Princess Diana 
that line the walls interspersed among pictures of the queen and 
other notable figures from British history. The atmosphere of 
P.O. W . is unique. Seating is strictly on a first-come-first-served 
basis and on a weekend night it is often difficult to find a table. 
Despite this minor inconvenience, P.O.W . is an excellent starting 
point for an evening out. 

The food at Princess of Wales is wnatone would expectata typical 
English restaurant: fish and chips, steak and kidney pie, eel pie, etc . I 
first asked what the soup of the day was. "Well," said the waitress, 
"it's cold and it's made with potatoes." Later she confided that she 
could not pronounce vichicois and a nearby Englishman said, "Oy, 
that's not nice!" I opted for the fish and chips which seemed like the 
typic;:al thinlil for an American to order at P.O.W . I was very relieved 
to find that when my meal arrived, the pieces of fish did not look like 
each other nor did they look like any others in the restaurant. This 
meant mat either the tish (lId not come out ot a large box from a 
freezer at the Price Club or that someone in the kitchen had gone to a 
good deal of trouble to make it look like it hadn't. 

There was no cause for complaining in any case, in fact, it was 
quite good. In addition to a full English menu, P.O .W. offers an 
incredibly wide assortment of English beers. Fortunately, dark beers 
are not served warm. The pints are big, perhaps even too big. Rather 
than having a full pint , two half pints are advised.

Do you retnell1ber Sean Kelly? 
by iue peten 

I remember Sean Kelly -
didn't he dye his hair green 
once? Wasn't he in the group 
"Sean Kelly and the Teenage 
Radio Stars?" Then in 
Melbourne a few years ago, a 
story went around about his 
new band, the Models, and 
their exploits on a first visit to 
London - they all got terribly 
drunk and were promptly 
arrested by a London 
policeman. 

That was when they wrote 
songs with titles like "Tow 
Cabs to the Toucan," and 
"Atlantic Romantic, " and 
chose album titles with 
obnoxius lengths - Alphabra 
ocharliedeltaechofoztrot~ 
golf." The Sean Kelly , 
(reputed descendant of Ned 
Kelly, an infamous Australian 
highwayman and folk hero), 
the band's lead vocalist, 
projected his voice from his 
nasal passages (rather than his 
diaphragm, that is). He also 
liked to shout a lot - punkish 
snarls of cynical but witty 
lyrics.

Although the band was 
never quite commercially 
successful, it had a strong 
underground following 
through o ut Melbourne. 
Returning Singer/ songwriter 
James Freud managed a minor 
commercial success with a 
boppy tune called "Modern 
Girl," (and a brilliant s..side 
called "Enemy Lines," which 
no one ever paid any attention 
to). 

The band may finally have 
broken through. Out of Mind 
Our of Sight, the band 's latest 
album, features 10 songs, one 
of which, "I Hear Motion, " is 
off their previous album. The 
band has come a long way 
from the days of singing about 
toucans - perhaps too far. 

It seems there's a certain 
point bands tend to reach -
particularly those which start 
off with a rough, garage sound 
- where suddenly all the 
unprofessional , unhewn 
sounds which mark and make 
a young band so appealing are 
traded in for a "sophistica-
tion" - sometimes known as 

overproduction. One need 
only look at bands like the 
Psychedelic Furs - compare 
the first album with Mirror 
Mooes or Japan's Adolescent 
Sex with Gentlemen Take 
Polaroids. It 's not that the 
third album syndrome of 
overproduction produces bad 
albums - it's just that it gets 
to a point where the music 
becomes "numb." 

This is somewhat the case 
with the Model's latest album. 
Even Sean's vocals have been 
polished. (Horrors!) It's not a 
bad album - the band has 
always been innovative and 
daring. Now they're even 
danceable. The title track is 
very smooth - unlike 
anything they've done before. 
And if radio stations in San 
Diego are playing their music, 
the band just might be on the 
verge of success in the United 
States. (You can already see 
their video on MTV.) Sean 
said recently that he'd like to 
come out here - to L.A. at 
least. I recommend their 
E.P. called Cut Lunch.

13 ways to skin a tree 

If you are into music, don't 
miss L.A.'s hottest Chic-
ano/Latino band, "califas." 
Of course, there will be ' the 
traditional MariachiS, 
"Cachanilla," and if you 
enjoy dance, the Ballet 
Folklorico of UCSD and 
Tijuana's Centro Cultural will 
be there. Heading the program 
will be Dana Azteca -
"Mexicayotl," a pre-
Colombian dance group. 

the Drama Department's Dr. 
Jorge Huerta, will be 
performed in Spanish and 
English. Hureta recommends 
that even the non-bilingual 
view the play in both 
languages just to see what a 
difficult exercise it is for an 
actor to perform the same 
thing in two different 
languages. Nora was translated 
into English by John 
Herschel-DobIes, a graduate 
of UCSD's M.F.A. program 
in playwriting. The English 
version is at 1 pm and the 
Spanish version at 3 pm, in 
the Mandeville Recital Hall. 
The Teatro will also be 
touring Nora in Southern 
California. It is the group's 
10th year in existence, since 
founded by Huerta in 1976. 

Thirteen folk artworks of 
hand-made and hand-painted 
bark paper from the state of 
Guerrero, Mexico, will be on 
display at the UCSD's Grove 
Gallery from April 29 
through May 17. 

The exhibition, called "A 
Mano: Bark Paintings of 
Guerrero" is a generous loan 
from the CentrO Cultural in 
Tijuana to UCSD. 

The exhibition will host 
two public receptions at the 
gallery: the first, on May 2 
from 12 to 2 pm is in 
conjuntion with UCSD's 
celebration of Cinco de Mayo; 

the second, on May 4, from 
nooon to 2 pm, will take place 
during UCSD's annual Open 
House. 

The exhibition contains 14 
paintings, the majority are 
black and white, a few are in 
color. The paintings are done 
on bark paper made from the 
amate tree, a type of fig which 
grows in the state of Guerrero. 
Bark painting is an ancient 
tradition which is still 
practiced there . 

The exhibit was made 
possible through the 
generosity and cooperation of 

the followi ng Mexian 
agencies: The Secreta ria de 
Educacion Publica, Subsecre-
taria de Cultura, Direccion, 
General de Culturas 
Populares, Museo Nacional 
de Culturas Populares, 
Centro Cultural Tijuana and 
the Programa Cultural de Las 
Fronteras. 

The UCSD Crafts Center 
/ Grove Gallery is open 
Tuesday through Saturday, 
from to am to 5 pm. Free 
parking is available on 
weekends. For additional 
information, telephone 452-
2637. 

Also on the program will be 
an art show, located in the 
Grove Gallery in the Crafts 
Center, called, itA Mano: 
Bark Paintin~s of Guerrero." 
which opens on April 29 and 
continues through May 1 7. 
The exhibition contains 14 
hand-painted folk artworks, 
done on handmade bark 
paper from the state of 
Guerrero, Mexico. 

Speaking of Open House, 
and staying in the Mexican 
theme, there will be two 
performances of Emilio 
Carballido's Nora, staged by 
the Teatro Ensemble de 
UCSD. The play, direc~ed by 

It should be a memorable 
event, and a nice way to end a 
week. Don't miss the 
Lowrider Car Show and carne 
asada and frijoles. The'T.G. 
begins at 4 pm. 

Put this down in your 
appointment calenders so you 
don't forget to be there. You'll 
have fun, eat great food, 
witness some fantastic 
performances and art. And, 
who knows? Maybe you'll 
meet someone special. After 
all, it's spring.

As execizes in style, two 

new film nair throwbacks, 
Alan Rudolph's Trouble in 
Mind and Hal Ashby's 8 
Million Ways to Die can't be 
beat. It is only when their 
makers decide to get down to 
the dirty business of telling a 
story that both films fall apart, 
each to differing degrees, and 
each in different wa ys.

why the critics are falling all 
over themselves in support of 
this film: the moments the 
film gives us are great). 

Take, for instance, the first 
"meeting" between Kristoffer 
on and Singer. Or the wild 
lovers' chase above and 
beneath the streets of 
RainCity. Or the fight at 
Wanda's. And then there's 
the already classic response 
when Coop asks Wanda 
where his wife is: "Who 
knows? Shopping, maybe? 
Movie? Life goes on." 

It may well be that Trouble 
in Mind (at Mann's Valley 
Circle) is the more successful 
of the two, but average movie-
goers may disagree. This, 
above aLL, is an art film: full of 
moody hues and technical 
flair. Unfortunately, there's 
not much substance. 

At the core of this 

atmospheric romance is Hawk 
(Kris Kristofferson), an ex-
cop who has finally been 
sprung from prison after 
serving almost eight years for 
murder. Without hesitation, 
Hawk heads back to RainCity 
to find whatever it is he lost. 
Also heading to RainCity are 
Coop (Keith Carradine) and 
Georgia (Lori Singer), a small-
town hick and his ingenuous 
wife. They all meet one dismal 
evening at Wanda's Cafe. 
Wanda (Genevieve Bujold) 
will unWittingly become 

caught in the middle of the 
soon-to-form love triangle, 
after she aLLows Coop and 
Georgia to stay on her 
property. 

Apart from Coop's slow 
descent into a life of crime, 
little else happens in Trouble in 
Mind, and that's too bad, 
because 20 minutes or so into 
the movie we expect 
something to happen; no, 
more than that - we deserve 
it. 

Rudolph's last film, Choose 
Me, succeeded because it paid 

off wonderfully. He followed 
an unwritten rule of the film 
nair heyday: let the audience 
wait around for a while, then 
give them what they came for. 
So, as Choose Me slowly 
progressed, we found 
ourselves entangled in a sexy, 
serio-comic series of 
misundersta nd i ngs. 

Unfortunately, Trouble in 
Mind has no payoff. It seems 
to exist just like so much 
padding in between some 
undeniably classic movie 
moments (which is probably 

It's too bad the whole film 
couldn't have been more like 
these glimmering moments. 
Then this movie would truly 
have been something to see.

How much do you 
to go to college? 

The most difficult test some students face this faU isn't getting into college. It's paying for it. 
Because for many students, financial assistance such as scholarships, grants, work-study programs, 
and family resources don't cover the bill. 

That's why Chase offers four different educational loans, with affardable interest rates and flex-
ible repayment plans~ 

What's more, you don't etien need to hatie 
an account with us. Chase makes loans to 
qualified students and parents throughout the 
US. And we usually process your application 
within 24 hours. 

Complete the coupon or call 1-800-

cation, and we'll send you "The Student Guide,"

On the other hand, it's too 
bad 8 Milion Ways to Die 
couldn't have been more like 
Trouble in Mind: quieter, more 
subdued and relaxed. This is a 
psychopathically constructed 
film if ever there was one. 

a Million Ways to Die 
( wh ich gets its ti tie from a pia y 
on words with the prologue to 
The Naked City), also 
concerns the exploits of an ex-
cop who killed a man. It also 
has a romantic tinge and takes 
place in the underbelly of a 
dark city, this time a more 
recognizable Los Angeles. 

Jeff Bridges plays the cop 
this time, with absolutely no 
signs that he ever belonged to 
the police force . The film has 
to tell us this; for all we know 
he could have been a mailman. 
All that matters about his 
previous job, though, is that 
he killed a man at the 
breakfast table, in front of his 
terrified wife and children. 
And this made him become an 
alcoholic. Or maybe he was 
already one; it is just one of 
the many unanswered 
questions the film, based on 
Lawrence Block's novel, 
throws at us. 

Somehow, somewhere 
along the line, Bridges meets 
up with Rosanna Arquette 
(it's all too difficult and 
convoluted to try to explain), 
and together they must try to 
find out who murdered a 
high-priced hooker who was 
apparently in love with 
Bridges before her death. 

Why they decide to take it 
upon themselves to find this 
murderer, I don't know. If 
they had just forgotten about 
it, life would have been much 
easier for all involved, 
including us. What I do know 
is that in the course of 8 
Million Wa ys to Die, the 
record number of times for 
saying " f---," previously held 
by Brian de Palma's equally 
contrived Scarface is broken. 

It is actually very difficult to 
watch actors as good as 
Bridges and Arquette 
wandering around in this film, 
especially after both gave such 
memorable performances last 
year in movies likeJagged Edge 
and SiltJeTado. At least director 
Ashby and screenwriters 
Oliver Stone and David Lee 
Henry (the former, not 
surprisingly, was also 
responsible for Scarface) have 
given us one of the most 
dubiously romantic scenes of 
the year: after a passionate 
kiss, Arquette throws Bridges 
on the bed and promptly 
throws up in his pants. So 
much for art. 

Again, this is a nice film to 
watch; in fact, there are some 
great scenes and even some 
tense moments toward the 
end of the film. Unfortunate-
ly, what has preceded these 
moments is often so ludicrous 
that there may not be much of 
an audience to watch the final 
shoot-out. 

As it stands, take your 
choice. Despite Arquette's 
gorgeous looks, I think I'd go 
for a few great movie 
mome nts, But given the 
choices, it might be better just 
to stay home.
