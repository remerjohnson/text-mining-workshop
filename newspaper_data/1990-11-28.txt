CEP Approves Change to PINP Deadline 
By Tammy Crawford 
Staff Writer 

AssociatedStudentsPresidentJorul 
Edson's proposal for an extension of 
the pass/no pass grading option de.!d-
line has been approved by the Com-
mittee on Educational Policy (CEP). 

In October, Edson proposed that 
the deadline, currently set at the end of 
the second week, be moved to the 
fourth week in order to give students 
more time to assess their ability in their 
classes. 

Even though the proposal has been 
approved, it must still be put up for 
public comment by the faculty and 
taffofUCSD, who will besentletters 

explaining the proposal and given a 

certain amount of time to corrunent If 
there are any strong objections, the 
proposal may be reconsidered 

1ben, at the beginning of Winter 
Quarter, the proposal will go to the 
Academic Senate's Representative 

Assemblywhere~jectionsmayagain 
be voiced. 

"I need to be there to debate any 
objections," Edson said. 

However, Edson explained that he 
is very optimistic about the approval 
of the proposal because the CEP had 
no objections. 

''They all supported it," Edson said. 
"Having CEP endorse it i half the 
battle." 

Edson also explained that there 

was an outpouring of student support 
for the proposal. 

"We received 2,044 signatures in 
seven days on a petition of the ex-
tended deadline," he said. 

Edson explained that the main 
concern about the pass/no pass grad-
ing option is not the deadline but rather 
the concept of pass/no pass. 

"Two years ago, [college] provosts 
and deans were against the idea of a 
pass/no pass grade." he said 'They 
were worried that tudents wouldn't 
work as hard if they weren't working 
for a grade. 1ben the grading option

Committee Votes to 
Permanently Ban 
Alcohol at Beaches 
By Jennifer Meadows 
Staff Writer 

After reviewing the effects of the 
temporary alcohol ban imposed on La 
Jolla Shores and North Park Commu-
nity Park last June, the San Diego City 
Council's Committee on Public Fa-
cilities and Recreation (PF&R) has 
voted not only to make the ban perma-
nent, but also to extend it to include all 
San Diego beaches and horelineparks. 

The committee, which consists of 
five of the nine San Diego City Coun-
cil members, voted unanimously to 
recommend the approval of the alco-
hol ban. The matter will be considered 
by the full council in mid-January. 

'The committee voted to make 
those bans pennanent, and also to ex-
tend the bans to include all the beaches 
and shoreline parks from the Mission 
Beach Jetty oorth to the Del Mar city 
limits," said PF&R Committee Con-
sultant Gwen Davis. 

Davis also said that the issue of 
even further expansion of the bans to 
include Mission Bay Park and some 
streets thatareconsidered public rights-
of-way in Mi ion Beach and Pacific 
Beach, mainly along Mission Boule-
vard, will be sent back to committee for 
additional discussion in mid-January. 

Lisa Gonzalez of Councilwoman 
Abbe Wolfsheimer's office said that 
Wolf heimer would continue to surr 
port the ban, and would also push for 
further expan:.ion to the areas under 
consideration. Wolf: heirnerrepresents 
di trict one of San Diego, which in-
clud La Jolla and University City. 

Gonzalez also said that police re-
ports and citizen feedback howed 
thatthe trial ban at La Jolla Shores and 
North Park had been "very effective." 

"We received lotsofletters saying 
that now families can go back to the 
beach," Gonzalez explained. 

According to Francisco Estrada, 
theexecutiveas i tanttoCouncilman 
and PF&R Committee Chair Bob 
Filner, "Most of the mail and phone 
calls that we received were in upport 
of the ban, contrary to the ituation 
when the ban was initially propo ed 
last year, and most of the correspon-
dence and testimony we got was 
against the alcohol ban." 

Estrada said that a report prepared 
on the trial ban indicated that calls for 
police service, instances of vandal-
i m, and the transient population have 
all dropped at the North Park Com-
munity Park, and the number of chil-
dren using the park has increased. 

Estrada added that the number of 
complaints to po]jceat LaJoila Shore 
and the amount of trash on the beach 
have also decreased. 

Paul Downey, press ecretary for 
San Diego MayorMaureenO' Connor, 
said that O'Connor continues to op-
pose the ban. 

"Her feeling i that there are al-
ready laws on the books that make it 
illegal to do the thing people are 
complaining about. What we need to 
do i work out a way to better enforce 
tho e existing law ," Downey said.

Tougher Parking Ticket Regulations Will Not Be Enforced at UCSD 
â€¢ San Diego Police can now ticket cars three times a day, 
but UCSD parking officials say they're 'not out for blood' 
By Eric Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

Parking illegally in San Diego can 
now cost up to $96 per day, according 
to revised San Diegotraffic laws which 
took effect Nov. 26, but a campus 
parking official said that the change 
will not affect parking at UCSD which 
took effect Nov. 26. 

1be new regulations allow park-
ing officers to ticket illegally parked 
cars up to three times per day for the 
same offense. 

Previously,acar ittinginaone-or 
two-hour time limit zone could only 
be ticketed once for a $14 fine. Now, 
traffic officers can ticket that car three 
times, increasing the fme to $42. 

More expensive violation, uch 
as parking in a metered zone without 
payingor t ppinginaredzone,could 

lbackth violat rupto$96perday, 
trebled m th usual $32 per ticket. 

According to Howard Finnecy, 
assistantmanagerofUCSD's Depart-
ment of Parking and Transportation 
Services, the new city regulations are 
not being enforced on campus at this 
time. 

Finnecy cited the harshness of the 
regulations as the reason they will not 
be used on the UCSD campu . 

"The only way to get an additional 
ticket j if someone comes along and 
takes the citation from [the] car," 
Finnecy said "We don't repeatedly 
cite a car in one pace." 

Finnecy also said he does not forsee 
any po ibility of additional ticketing 
in the future. "We have no plan to 
change anything here along that line," 
he aid 

A cording to Finnecy, U Dtr'.ll-
fic patrols are not intended to take 
m ney from tudents' wallet. 

"We're not utfi rblood," Finnecy 

said 
According to Janet Reyman of the 

San Diego Police Department, there is 
a minimum one hour delay between 
tickets in a limited time or metered 
zone. 

Traffic police are supposed to wait 
two hours for expensive violations, 
such as parking in a red zone. 

Reyman added that traffic police 
have been warning offenders since 
October about the new harsher policy. 
1be regulations, he said, were not 
designed to hurt motorists. 

''TIle whole purpose was to tum 
over traffic. [Previou ly] if someone 
got a ticket in the moming, they could 
stay there all day and not be cited 
again," he said. 

' 'The intent was that vehi Ie need 
to leave 'pac . We need the maxi-
mum number of pa for as many 
people as PO ' ittl ," Reyman added. Parking violations will still cost at UCSD, but they won 't be tripled.

Berkeley Activists Protest Tien's 
Acceptance of Arizona Bowl Bid 

BERKELEY - Demonstrators at UC Berkeley on 
ov. 20 condemned Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien 's deci-

sion to support the UC Berkeley football team' accep-
tance ora tentative bid to Arizona's Copper Bowl. 

Marching from Tien' s office to Sproul Plaza, the 1,'fOUp 
of pro1estors grew from 15 to 50, and included UC 
Berkeley rudentS, representatives from the NAACP, and 
members of the Black Men United for Change (BMUC). 

The protestors focused on Tien' support of the deci-
sion to accept the Copper Bowl bid and what they charge 
is the use of African-American team members to justify 
the decision. 

The protest was sparked by a recent vote in Arizona on 
whether the state should celebrate Martin Luther King 
Day. The holiday referendum was defeated. 

Despite student protests and condemnations by the 
NAACP and members ofthe faculty, a university spokes-
person said on Nov. 20 that the chancellor stands fiml on 
his decision to accept the bowl bid. 

'''The concerns that people have raised are important 
concerns that need to be addressed, but the decision has 
been made and that will not change," said campus spokes-
man Ray Colvig. 

He added that the university iscollsideringsuggestions 
to commemorate King on the day of the bowl. 

Shyaam Shabaka, secretary for BMUC, claims that 
Tien's decision presents a moral and political issue not 
only about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but also about aU 
African-American struggles. 

'The decision was insensitive to the needs of the black 
community .It was wrong for the chancellorlo put football 
above moral issues," Shabaka said. 

Thordie Ashley, a regional West Coast director for the 
AACP, said that the organization would attempt to 

influence the chancellor's final decision on Nov. 24, in 
hopes that he would reject the bowl bid. She said the 
chancellor indicated he was confident in his decision.

Gardner Outlines UC System Future, 
Laments Loss of Prop. 143 Funding 

BERKELEY -UC President David Gardneroutlined the 
univel ity ' goals for the coming yearduringthe first system-
wide Academic Senate meeting of the semester. 

Speaking Nov. 20 to about 40 representati ves from the nine 
campuses gathered in UC Berkeley's Faculty Club, Gardner 
aid that the University of Califomia's operating budget will 

increase eight or nine percent, even though the tate' overall 
budget is projected to increa e by 12 percent. 

Gardner al 0 stated that overaU enrollment at the nine 
campuses will increase to a total of about 65,000 by the year 
2005. 

UCBerkeley, the only campus without enrollment growth 
plans, is expected to drop it total number of students by 1,500 
over the next 15 years. 

In order to accommodate the influx of students, Gardner 
said the university will either have to build a new campus or 
expand its available facilities. 

Gardnerexpresseddismay over the rejection of Propos tit ion 
143. which would have provided $ 132million for the UC,and 
over the legislature 's inability to meet the financial needs of 
theUC. 

This, he said, has placed in jeopardy the University 'S 
ability to pay for long-tenn projects. One of these is a new 
campus to be located in the Central Valley. 

"Eighty-five percent of this state's budget is protected 
either by constitution or statute and we're not in that 85 
percent. Mo t of the members of the state legislature know 
that's untenable," Gardner said. 

Gardner also expressed concern over the quality of under-
graduate education, pointing a critical finger at lower -division 
courses. 

Rising Costs Threaten Grad Student 
Health Insurance Program at UCR 

RIVERSIDE - UC Riverside's first-ever mandatory 
graduate student health insurance program may soon be 
canceled if administrative problems force a referendum to 
increase the fee for the program. â€¢ 

High costs for the implementation of tlte program could 
lead campus officials to propose a $20-$30 increase, which, 
when coupled with an expected jump in the premium, could 
require student approval through a referendum. 

Under a referendum passed last year to approve the insur-
ance program, a student vote is required on any increase of

UCSB Professionals, Students Talk 
About Benefits of Legalizing Drugs 

SANTA BARBARA - Students gathered in Storke 
Plaza at UC Santa Barbara Nov. 7 to listen to arguments 
in favor ofthe legalization of marijuana. 

Five speakers, including a doctor, a lawyer, and two 
UCSB students tried to convince the laughing, cheering, 
and sometimes pot-smoking crowd of more than 300 that 
there are sound medical, political, 3Tld economic reasons 
why drugs should be legal in the United States. 

A main theme was that the U.S. government's cam-
paign to eradicate drugs is fraudulent, and that marijuana 
plants could make a good alternative energy source if"big 
business" was not standing in the way. 

David Bearman, founder of the Isla Vista Open Door 
Clinic and the first professor to teach a course on drugs at 
UCSB, opened the rally with a medical argument fort he 
legalization of marijuana. 

"Marl juana has some side effects. It's not hannless ... 
but I would have to say it is less hannfulthan many legal 
recreational drugs.. . . It is much safer than alcohol or 
barbiturates," Bearman said. 

Gerald Horne, Black Studies chair, urged students to 
research more about the U.S. government's "War on 
Drugs" anti-drugcampaign. According to Home, the U.s. 
government is actually involved in the sale of drugs, thus 
making its war unfounded. 

"One would think that if this administration in Wash-
ington, D.C. was honestly concerned about a drug war, 
they would begin by prosecuting themselves," Home 
said. 

Deviating from the theme of drug legalization, UCSB 
students Shari Menard and Chris Peterson discussed the 
use of hemp plant as an environmentally sound altemati ve 
fuel source. Citing the fact that the U.S. Constitution was 
printed on paper made from hemp, Menard and Peterson 
imagined a hemp-based economy, using hemp in the 
petroleum, textile, paper, and food industries. The ob-
stacle, according to Menard and Peterson, is big business. 

"Because this country's elite [doesn't] want to sacri-
fice profits for a healthier planet," they don't pursue the 
development of alternative, safer forms of fuel, Menard 
said.

UCSA Searches for Students to Sit on 
California Higher Education Committee 
By Rachel Blackburn 
Staff Writer 

Earlier this year, the California 
Legislature passed a bill which es-
tablished two new student positions 
on the California Postsecondary 
Education Commission (CPEC). 

1be CPEC is the main advisory 
body to the state legislature and the 
governor on higher education is-
sues, and consists of representatives 
from all segments of California 
higher education, the State Board of 
Education, and the general public. 

According to Jeremy Pasternak, 
UCSD's representative to the Uni-
ve_rsity of California Student Ass0-
ciation (UCSA), the appoinb1lentof 
students to the commission is com-
parable to the appointment of a stu-
dent to the UC Board of Regents, 
and will provide an "incredible op-
portunity" to students. 

"nlis is a huge step forward, 
particularly because these individu-
als are going to have a voice- they 
are not going to be drowned out," he 
said. 

''1be bill gives students much 
more of an influence over decisions 
that affect them. Before, it was not 
always easy for [the CPEe] to know 
what's in a student's best interest In 
the future it will be easy to tum to the 
students on the board and ask them 
what the students think," he said. 

Previously, the CPEC has had to 
rely on surveys to try to find out 
what students at each of the nine UC 
campuses want. Now, students will 
have a "unified voice" through their 
representatives on the commission, 
Pasternak said. 

Elaine Yamaguchi, the UCSA 
university affairs advocate, agreed 
with Pasternak that the students will 
be influential on the commission. 

"We will have a direct voice and 
vote with two voting vocal students 
on a commission of fifteen," she 
said. 

The nominations for the two p0-
sitions will come from each of the 
five segments of higher education 
in California: the UC, California 
State Universities, community col-
leges, private universities, and tech-
nical and trade schools. 

Students from these segments 
will have the opportunity to nomi-
nate up to five students for the posi-
tions. By February, two of those 
five will be appointed by Governor 
Pete Wilson to serve staggered two-
yeartenns. 

According to Pastemak, students 
from the public sector - the ues, 
theCalifomiaState Universities, and 
thecommunitycolJeges-arethose 
"most affected" by CPEC decisions. 

"Given the more serious interest 
and the fact that UCSA sponsored 

the bill I hope we can get one of our 
people onto CPEC," he said. 

Applications will be accepted 
until Dec. 14 for any UC student 
who wishes to apply for a position 
on the commission. Application 
forms, which require candidates to 
respond to three essay questions 
and provide three references, are 
available from the Associated Stu-
dents office on the third floor ofthe 
Price Center. 

"1be Executive Committee of 
the UCSA will serve as a prelimi-
nary screening committee for the 
applications at its December meet-
ing," UCSA President Susan Polan 
said. "[The committee] will nomi-
nate five students to the full board, 
from which the board will nominate 
two students for the governor's con-
sideration. " 

However, it is not definite that 
exactly two students will be nomi-
nated by the UCSA. 

"It is already detennined that the 
nwnber will be [between two and 
four]," Pasternak said. "It will cer-
tainly be less than five." 

"We don't want to inundate [the 
Governor). We want to keep the 
choice narrow," he said. 

The UCSA's nominations will 
be detennined at its January board 
meeting, which takes placeat UCSD 
from Ian. 4.6,1991.

THE RIMAC DECISION 

Kudos For Atkinson 
For what seems to be the first time in recent memory, 

Chancellor Atkinson actually supported a major student con-
cern. Last Monday, Atkinson rejected proposed changes to the 
planned Recreational Intramural and Athletic Cenler(RIMAC) 
submitted by the Academic Senate, and approved the facility 
plan as is. All that's left now is a thumbs-up from the regents , 
and the heavy equipment could be rolling in within a year. 

With Atkinson's endorsement of RIMAC comes a collec-
tive sigh of relief from administrators and students. Atkinson 
was clearly aware that altering the RIMAC plan could have 
compromised the student referendum approved last Winter 
Quarter. Such a compromise could have led to the nullification 
of the referendum and required a re-vote. Rather than gamble 
with the fate of RlMAC by pUlling it in the hands of the fickle 
student body for a second time, Atkinson did the right thing. 

Additionally, Atkinson's stamp of approval will help allay 
many of the doubts and fears of RIMAC critics. Atkinson 
gracefully chastised the faculty . calling the Academic Senate's 
concerns "overly pe simistic." 

With this decision, Atkinson has fonnally acknowledged 
many students' feelings, while pointing out that current athletic 
and recreational facilities at UCSD are dreadfully inadequate. 

In his memo, Atkinson said, '"Our present facilities are 
totally inadequate even for present needs, let alone those of a 
future student population projected to be 26,000 by the year 
2005." 

The chancellor's approval was es ential\y the final, major 
obstacle to be overcome on the road to RIMAe. His foresight 
and good judgement are well worth applause. 

ISIS 

Fee Process Made Easier 
Students will be happy to know that the snake-like payment 

lines traditionally seen at the beginning of each quarter will 
soon be a thing of the pasl. The Integrated Student Information 
System, or ISIS as it is better known, will be the snake-killer 
as it were. ISIS is a new campus-wide computer system which, 
once it is fuJly operational, will bring all student financial and 
academic information into one system. UCSD Bursar Howard 
Fisher is telling the truth when he says there is no other 
university with beller service. ISIS will not only end the fee-
payment nightmare, but will eventually make registration for 
classes even easier. 

Quite simply, ISIS is yet another convenient way to make 
students' lives easiel. According to the bursar, all billings will 
be centralized. Hou ing payments will be able to be made at 
the Central Cashiers Office along with registration fees. Fi-
nancial aid recipient will no longer be burdened with going 
from office-to-office and line-to-line, trying to pick up their 
check. With the new system, registration fees will be auto-
matically offset against financial aid. 

ISIS will eventually be integrated with the T-REG system. 
The centralized informal ion system, in addition to a proposed 
increase in telephones, could make the registration process 
much faster and reduce the possibility - however remote-
ofa student'S records being "lost in the huffle." 

ISIS basically amounts to what Fisher calls a "one-stop 
shop." Of course, because payment will be completely com-
puterized, students will have to be extra-careful to pay their 
fees on time. 

As repugnant the thought of paying fees may be, at least the 
administration has made things a bit easier. While other UC 
campuses are still toying with the idea of telephone registra-
tion and computer-assisted tudent infonnation systems, UCSD 
seems to be well ahead of the pack. 

With a projected student population of26,050 by the year 
2005, these new systems are an absolute must for effective 
op!ralion. 

After all, if you have a bureaucracy, you might as well make 
it the finest.

BENSON 

Founding Fathers Know Best 
â€¢ America was built on the right to keep and bear arms 

" ... The right of the people to keep and bear 
arms, shall not be infringed," 

Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
"I do not believe in people owning guns, only 

police and military. I am going to do everything I 
can to disarm this state." 

Michael Dukakis, June 16, 1986 

When citing theimpor-
tanceoffreedomofspeech, 
religion and the press, 
people often point to the 
fact that these ri ghts were 
placed first among the 
other rights. If placement 
of rights in the Constitution 
is a signal of their impor-
tance, then the right guar-
anteed by the Second 
Amendment must be of 
great worth. The founders 
were ingenious men who 
carefully thought out the 
numerical placement in 
relationship to importance, 
of our freedoms. It is thus not surprising that the right 
to keep and bear arms was placed second among all our 
rights. To gain a better understanding of the right to 
bear.arms. let us look at the events and thoughts of the 
founders which lead to the Second Amendment. 

Shortly before the outbreak of the WarofIndepen-
dence, Ihe Brirish General Gage attempted to register 
and confiscate a\1 of the colonial firearms. This was 
one of the pri mary grievances stated by Samuel Adams 
and unfortunately has been overlooked by many histo-
rians as one of the primary causes of the War of 
lndependence. . 

During the framing oftheConstitution ,the founders 
recalled the many attempts by the British to confiscate 
American tireanns and encroach on the freedom of the 
people. At the Constitutional convention James Madi-
son remarked that "one of the main diffesences be-
tween a free American republic and the despotic 
monarchies of Europe was armed citizemy." The 
founding fathers knew the only way tho people could 
have true power over their goverrunent and thus be 
able to prevent totalitarian exploitation by it. was 
through armed revolt. 1bomasIefferson even went as 
far as to say "a little revolution every now and then is 
a good thing. I' The founders knew they were about to 
set in motion a fonn of government that had never 
existed before. To have power in the hands of the 
people instead of a monarch was a unique, fragile. and 
easily changed scenario. 

The founders knew if power was to be taken away 
from the people it would occur in small steps so as to 

prevent the sudden backlash of the populace. The first 
stage would be the removal of arms from the citiuns. 
At the drafting Patrick Heory wrote. "Guard with 
jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone 
who approaches that jewel Unfortuoately nothing 
will preserve it but dowo right force. Whenever you 
give up tbal force you are inevitably ruined." 

One could Only imagine the outrage . of PaItIck 
Henry upon reading the quote at the beginning of this 
article by presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. 

To be fuUy coovinced that the right to bear anns 
was intended for all people (with the exception of 
convicted criminals), not just some collective state 
army, a deeper look into the Constitution may be in 
order. 

The phrase "The peop\e" is used not only in the 
Second Amendment, but also in the first, fourth,ninth 
and tenth. To say that the rights listed in these amend-
ments are assigned to someone other than individual 
citizens, such as the right of the "people"to bear anns 
referring to a state military makes absolutely no 
sense. 

To believe that the tenn "militia" implies a state-
run military organization is to ignore all historical 
facts. The whole idea of a militia is that free men of a 
community. anned with their personal firearms, be 
able to defend that cl.>mmunity. Time and time again, 
whether it be in their documents or speeches, the 
founders referred to a citizen-run militia. and not that 
of the government. 

I find it ironic that people speak of a vague, 
unwritten, and implied right to privacy that is guar-
anteed by the Constitution, as supreme to a\1 other 
govemment interests. Yet a right so explicitly stated 
as the right to bear arms can be diluted anddisregarded. 
The Second Amendment should be treated like all 
other amendments. Could one imagine if the situation 
were reversed and all the other amendments were 
treated like the Second Amendment. We would have 
to get a permit to run a newspaper and only certain 
kindsof newspapers could be circulated. If we wanted 
to open a chwch we would have to get government 
approval and an operating permit. As one can see. it 
is setting a dangerous precedent to go beYQnd the 
original meaniog of the Constitution. 

In I1'U1h 1 do realize why there is such a strong 
movement to outlaw the private ownership of guns. 
America has an alanningly high homicide rate and it 
is believed thai removal of guns from me private 
sector will lower it. Ironically, nothing could be 
further from the truth. 

To fully understand gun related deaths we must 
look at the nature of these deaths, why they continue, 
and the effectiveness of gun control in preventing 
homicides.

Homophobia Is the Real Problem 
Editor: 

I was angered and saddened at 
the Guardian's printing of Zachary 
Berman 's article ("People Infected 
With AI.D.S. Need to be Identi-
fied," Nov. 16). Ten years into an 
epidemic, we don ' I need to hear yet 
another grossly misinformed 
"opinion" about a condition Ihat 
seriously jeopardizes all of us. 

Homophobia, which Mr. Bennan 
declares is something we're afraid 
of developing - as if it isn't deeply 
rooted in all of us - is the main 
reason for the government's inac-
tion from day one of this epidemic 
to today with one AI.D.S. death 
every 12 minutes and still no Na-
tional AI.D.S. Education program. 
In one day the Pentagon spends 
more money than the total spent for 
A.I.D.S. research and education 
since 1982. 

By 1991 , more Americans will 
die from A.I.D.S. each year than 
were killed in the entire Vietnam 
War. Mr. Bennan is unable to get up 
the nerve to use the word gay in the 
first paragraph, chOOSing instead to 
politely call us a "unique group." 
When he finally mentions IV drug 
users and prostitutes, he tells us how 
they "kill innocent victims." 

This idea resurrects a medieval 
belief in some sort of divine punish-
ment, and begs the question of h0w 
Mr. Bennan is able to tell the gUilty 
from the innocent. Nowhere is the 
African-American and Latino com-
munity mentioned. Fifty-five per-
cent of AI.D.S. cases are African-
American and Latino. 

What is passed off for as facts in 
the article are twisted misconcep-
tions and lies:

Guns 
Continued from page 4 

According to Allen R. llodgkins 
IH, a foremost expert on gun fatali -
ties, 55 percent of all firemTIl dealhs 
are from suicide, 4 percent flOm 
a cidents and I percent are "unde-
teITIlined." TIle remaining 40 per-
cent fall into the category of homi-
cides. Of this 40 percent, 25 percent 
are considered self-defense Gustifi-
able homicide). Out of the remain-
ing homicides, 55 percent are com-
mitted by people with prior violelll 
criminal records. Herein lies the crux 
of the problem. 

Our criminal justice system can 
best be characterized as "revolving 
door." Criminals spend too much 
time on the outside and too little 
time on the inside. This is why 55 
percent of all homicides were com-
mitted by people with past criminal 
records. The amount of actual time 
these men spend in prison i fright-
eningly low. 

For every 500 serious crimes, 20 
adults and 5 juveniles go to prison. 
Those unfortunate enough to go to 
jail can expectto pend 7.5 years for 
murder, 4.5 years for rape, 3 years 
for robbery, and 2.5 years for as-
sault. 

The solution to the problem is 
not the banning of private gun 
ownership; it is the hiring of more 
prosecutors and judges. it is the 
building of more jails. We must put 
and keep violent criminals away 
from society and behind bars where 
they belong. 

To believe that these people le-
gally acquire guns is extremely na-
ive. The U.S. Attorney General states 
thatfiveoutofsixofallgunsu edin 
acrimewereillegallyobtained. The 
U.S. Custom Agency notes that since 
198680,OOOSovietAKMrifleshave 
illegally entered the country and 
this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

Two facls are blalantly obvious. 
People with prior criminal records 
are theonescommittingthe murders 
and they are the people who obtain 
handguns illegally. Is outlawing 
handguns going to stop people who 
already obtain and use illegal fire-
arms? 

Oddly enough, some state legis-
lators believe banning gun will keep 
them out of the hands of criminals. 
Washington D.C. and New York 
City fall into this category. In 1976, 
our nation's capitol enacted a total 
handgun ban and impo ed a strict 
long-gun registration law. Since thm 
time, there has been a 168 percent 
increase in homicides. Additionally, 
the homicide rate attributed to fire-
anns kyrocketed 250 percent. 

Hopefully, these figures will 
prove the point that criminals who 
want to acquire and use handguns 
will do so, regardless of any local , 
state, or federal laws. 

We afeonly hurting ourselves by 
banning firealTIls. The man whose 
house is robbed, children beaten, 
and wife raped will be the loser. He 
will no longer be able to defend his 
life, fami ly, and propeny from the 
criminals we so expediently release 
from jail. The right to own fireanns 
is one of the most important aspects 
of a free society. It is the ultimate 
vestige of power in the people. Are 
we ready to forever lay down our 
ann and pennit the government to 
have the ultimate authority owr us? 

Fortunately, there is one faction 
of our sociely that will al way re-
main amled,even in the face of total 
gun restriction. Criminals. nd per-
hap if the time comes that we may 
need to defend ourselves, they will 
protect u .

point victories in the Triton Tip-
Off Tournament. 

"No one was satisfied with how 
the Tip-Off went, we weren't sat-
isfied with our level of play ," 
Marshall said. 

"The close scores are not in-
dicative of our play, rather that 
others are playing on emoiion and 
gunning for us because of our high 
[third] ranking." 

Defensively, the Tritons worked 
on foot positioning and being 
quicker on clo e-outs on cross-
court passes. 

On the other end, UCSD will be 
working on opening lanes and cre-
ating other options, such as getting

"Rick ha been getting four to 

eight shots per game. We want him 
in double digit in shot attempts," 
Marshall said. "Going inside will 
make things doubly difficult for de-
fenses to key on Tim [Rapp) . 

"Rapp has been carrying us, and 
he's a great player, but we need to be 
more flexible and versatile." 

Marshall fet!ls that his team needs 
to establish its inside game, and that 
the Norton game will provide a 
chance for UCSD to experiment. 

"Rapp and Tom [S hawcroft] will 
get their points, and Erik Johnson 
and John Spence will help carry us 
off the bench, but Rick (Batt], Chris 
Moore, Andy Swindall , and Gordon 
[McNeill] need to have solid perfor-
mances in the paint," Marshall said.

Men's Basketball 'Refining and Defining' 

Brian Morris/Guardian 
John Spence and the Tritons hope to rise above the competition this weekend at the Redlands Tournament. 

â€¢ Preview: UCSD travels to the 
Redlands Tournament, beginning 
tomorrow with a first-round matchup 
against Norton Air Force Base 
By Dana Chaiken 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's ba ketball team enter the University 
of Redland Tournament tomorrow afternoon with a 4-0 
record. Win or 10 e, the Tritons will sti ll be 4-0. 

No, that is not a typo. 
UCSD i paired with Norton Air Force Base in the opener 

of the eight-team tourney, a game which will not count 
toward the Tritons' ea on record or tatistics because 
Norton is not an NCAA team. 

In fact, according to Triton Head Coach Tom Marshall, 
"as a military team, they have a lot of guys in and out. 
They're a team in flux , and that make them hard to scout 
because you never know who you'l\ see from one night to 
the next." 

Marshall said, though, that he expects to face a running 
team, and knows that Norton has a 6'7" center. 

Though the game is es entially meaningles outside the 
context of the tournament, Marshall doesn't feel his squad 
doesn't views the matchup as just another crimmage. 

"The way to look at the situation is that Norton i 011 the 
road to winning the tournament. We have to get by them to 
get to the next hurdle." 

That hurdle may come either in the form of UCSD's 
nemesis from la t season - Menlo College - or Menlo' 
first round opponent, Cal Baptist. 

Last year in this tournament, in what Marshall called 
UCSD's best game of the eason, Menlo edged the Tritons 
on a last-second shot in double overtime in the semifinal . 

Marshall predicts that Menlo will emerge victoriou in 
an extremely physical battle with the Lancers. But ifhe had 
his druthers, the Tritons would face Cal Bapti t, a team 
UCSD will not see again this season. 

"We have two other games against Menlo this year, and 
three games against any team is too many," Marshall said. 

"If we have a relatively easy time again t Norton, get a 
lot of different players in the game and keep our starters 
re ted, we'll have an advantage against either Menlo or Cal 
Baptist, because they will have fought a war the day before." 

On the other half of the tournament bracket - which 
Marshall said is highly rated in term of strength of teams -
The Master's opens with Cal State San Bernardino, and ho t 
Redlands takes on Christ College of Irvine. 

Marshall expects The Master's to advance to Saturday 
night's final with a semifinal win over Redlands, expressing 
that The Master's i "rumored to be the be t small college 
team in California." The Mu tangs are comparable with the 
Tritons in the middle, po ting uptwo players at 6'S" or6'9". 

UCSD has spent the past week "refining and defining," 
according to Marshall , as the Tritons come off two two-

NCAA Polls, Elvis, Disneyland, and Paulina 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

Just a few note : 
â€¢ The NCAA poll system for ranking 

team epitomizes stupidity. 
Miami was college football' consensus 

number one pick at the beginning of the 
eason, but the Hurricanes were upset by 

COMMENTARY 
BYU in their season opener. 

What followed was a total los of com-
mon sen e. The coaches and media (who 
vote on the ranking ) pent the next 12 
weeks or so shuttl ing team in and out of the 
top pot faster than George Steinbrenner 
changed manager . 

Why in the world do the expert ' insist on 
b ting a team off the top of the poll imply 
becau e of one 10 's? 

Nobody'~ perfect. Brando flubs lines. 
Carson bombs. The 4ger lo:.e. Jordan mis e 

hots. Little Al crashes. And Paulina wakes 
up in the morning. 

Everyone has a bad day. One mistake is 
not indicative of a sudden loss of ability. 

Case in point: Colorado is currently the 
number one team in the country. The real 
news, however, is that Miami ha atoned for 
its two early-sea on losses and, in at least 
two polls, has climbed all the way back to 
the second slot. 

If Colorado loses to Notre Dame in the 
Orange Bowl, and Miami beats Texas in the 
Cotton Bowl, take one gues who the na-
tional champion will be. 

Miami wa th be t at the beginning of 
the year, and Miami could be the best at the 
end of the year. 

Where exactly does that put them during 
the rest of the year? 

â€¢ While we're on the topic of bowl 
games ... the Blockbuster Bowl? sin, 
B/ockbustC'r I-de-o ... WOW! What a dlf-

ference! Sure it's a quick buck, but have 
NCAA officials gone mad? 

â€¢ La t weekend, Michigan quarterback 
Elvis Grbac tried to get an Ohio State crowd 
to cooperate and quiet down by waving his 
arms up and down the way quarterba ks do. 

The fans might have listened to Presley. 
But, Grbac ... I don ' t think so. 

â€¢ There are only two players in football 
who make you think they are going to do 
something special every time they touch the 
ball - Bo Jackson and Raghib Ismail. 

â€¢ John Czarnecki of The National says 
that the Los Angele Rams should hire former 
4gers Head Coach Bill Walsh for the Ram ' 
front office. Among hi argument is that 
Walsh 's root ar in Southern alifornia. 

Walsh attended high school in Northern 
alifornia, graduated from an J eState, 

coa hed at Stanford, and pent 10 year with 
the 49 r. urrently, he reside~ and runs hi 
bu me in Palo Alto. 

What, did he visit Di neyland once? 
â€¢ Speaking of The National, check out 

thedaily's ad fora spiffy var ity jacket, with 
a big 'N' on the front, and The National's 
masthead on the back. 

According to the ad, it 's "just like the 
ones worn by such Nationa/luminaries a 
Mike Lupica, Scott Ostler, Dave Kindred, 
and Frank Deford." 

And only $195 . 
Editor in chief Deford must think every-

one is a dumb a the Oklahoma football 
team. 

â€¢ Joe Montana has 14 interception this 
year. That 's his career high. 

â€¢ The Lakers have already 10 t three home 
games this year. They lost only four all of 
la 'r season. 

â€¢ Picture 76er harles Barkley and 
Manute Bol standing next to each other . 

â€¢ It would be ab~olutely meaningles ' if
