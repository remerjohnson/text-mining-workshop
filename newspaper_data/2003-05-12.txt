The vote to increase student 
fees at the University of California 
has been delayed due to uncertain 
circumstances surroundi ng the 
state budget, a UC spokesperson 
said May 9. 

The UC Board of Regents was 
previou ly scheduled to vote on a 
proposed student fee increase at 
its May 14 meeting in San 
Francisco - the same day Gov. 

ray Davis will relca e his May 
revision to the 2003-04 budget. 
UC officials say the uncertainty of 
the governor's revi ion could pos-
sibly include an inflated increase 
because of skepticism surrounding 
the current economic situation in 
California. 

U officials felt delaying the 
vote would allow the Regents to 
assess the univer ity' financial SItu-
ation more clearly while al 0 avoid-
ing the po ible confuSIOn of more 
than one fee increase bemg passed 
within months. 

" It seems prudent to address 
the e is ue in a single action, 
rather than acting now and return-
ing again in a few weeks for anoth-
er vote - an approach that could 
produce considerable confusion 

GSA cuts graduation event funding 
New budget leaves out Med. School, IRIPS 

By LAUREN RAU 
Staff Writer 

The Graduate tudent 
Association determined its bud-
get for the 2003-04 year last 
week, deciding to eliminate two 
direct disbursements from the 
budget, which previously went to 
the chool of Medicine and the 
Interna tional Relations and 
Pacific StudIes departments. 
These two graduate programs 
formerly received amounts of 
S2,400 and S600, respectively, 
toward each program's gradua-
tion events. 

"Our goal in this change was 
to level the playing field by mak-

ing all departmental funding 
requests subject to the sa me 
approval and oversight proce-
dures," said GSA President Tom 
Fleming. 

Other changes to the GSA 
budget included an increase in the 
salary paid to the G A staff and 
elected officials, a decrea e in dis-
cretionary fu nds and the elimina-
tion of the mail ballot due to avai l-
ability on StudentLink. 

'' It 's not the details of the 
action that bother me," said 

lass of 2004 School of 
Medicine President Rambod 
Amirnovin . .. It'~ the sentiment 
behind it."

aid, is a part of the alienation that 
the medical students feel within 
the general graduate student 
group, specifically within the G A 
meetings. 

"It's not fair for a mall minor-
ity to receive line-item funding," 
said G A Vice President of 
Finance Lee Lovejoy. 

Accord ing to Lovejoy, there 
will be a general decrease in grad-
uate enrollment fall quarter. As 
such, the amount of money com-
ing in from the graduate student 
fees will refl ect a comparable 
decline. 

"We just can't afford to give that 
much money out," Lovejoy aid. 
"Regardless of the fairness is uc, we 
just don't have the funding." 

Lovejoy also noted that the 
S 150 increase to each of the G A 
offiCIals' annual tipend is a part 
of an effort panning the last 
three years. The staff wages allo-
cation increased by S5,000 10 
that time. 

According to Lovejoy, the

for students and their families," 
said UC President Richard C . 
Atkinson in a May 9 statement. " In 
the meantime, we will continue 
working aggressively in 
Sacramento to fight any additional 
budget cuts that could lead to fur-
ther fee increases or program 
reductions." 

UC officials ay that the uni-
versi ty has been the target of other 
lawmakers' proposed cuts to over-
come a mounti ng state budget 
problem. Assembly Speaker Herb 
J . Wesson (D-Los Angeles) has 
proposed a budget version with an 
additional S80 million cut from 
the Univer ity of California, in 
addition to the S900 million-plus 
that has been reduced from the 
UC budget within the last year. 

Assembly Republicans have 
backed a budget proposal that 
lashes an additional S400 mJlhon 

from the University of California's 
allocation. 

The University of California 
receives about 25 percent of its 
revenue from the state of 
California, UC budget analysts 
say. 

In January, the 2003-04 state 
budget was estimated to have a 
S34.6 billion shortfall, but Davis' 
May revision will include the 

recently collected tax revenue 
from 2002. According to UC 
Associate Vice President of Budget 
Planning and Fiscal Analysis Jerry 
I<is ler, the economic problems in 
California have grown since the 
January version. 

"The situation has become 
worse," Kisslcr said. "According to 
the indications we have now, the 
governor will probably be releasing 
estimates that are lower than the 
ones he had in January." 

Meanwhile, the Board of 
Regents were expected to vote on a 
S795-per-year student fee increa e 
for re ident undergraduates and a 
S855-per-year increase in resident 
graduate student fees at their May 
H meeting. 

The increase was proposed by 
Davis in January and would be 
effecuve fall 2003 

The Regent~ voted 10 
December 2002 to ral e under-
graduate s tudent fees by -+0 5 
annually, an increase whIch took 
effect pring 2003 . 

U spokesper on Hanan 
Eisenmalm said the Regents will 
probably vote on an increase at the 
June or July meetings. 

The deadline for a 2003-04 
budget is to be passed by June 30 as 
mandated in the state con titution.

Racial preiudice shown to 
affect children at early age 

A report by two UC Berkeley researchers 
indicates that children are aware of and 
affected by prejudices and stereotyping. 

Psychology professors Clark McKown and 
Rhona Weinstein found that children develop 
awareness of each others' stereotypes 
between the ages of six and 10. 

They found that black and Latino children 
who were aware of broadly held stereotypes 
performed less well on cognitive tasks when 
these were presented as a measure of ability 
than when they were described as problem-
solving tasks. Asian and white children per-
formed the same regardless of description. 

The researchers concluded that when 
children are aware of stereotypes, their per-
formance may be adversely impacted under 
conditions resembling standardized testing 
due to their concem that they will be judged 
on the basis of a stereotype. 

The report was published in the May 
issue of the Child Development 

Scientists examine 
methane release 

Scientists from around the world, includ-
ing UC Santa Cruz, arrived in Rio de Janeiro 
on May 6 after spending two months at sea 
near an ancient submarine mountain chain 
off Africa where they studied evidence of a 
massive release of methane that caused 
extreme global warming 55 million years ago. 

Scientists believe that about 2,000 giga-
tons of methane was released Into the 
atmosphere dunng the Paleocene-Eocene 
Thermal MaXimum penod, triggering massive 
global warming. This decompOSition process 
fasted about 40,000 years, warming the 
plane by more than five degrees CelSIUS. 

The scientists, as part of the Ocean Drilling 
Program Leg 208, set out to test hypotheses 
about the era. Sediments below the sea floor 
hold eIIIdence of thIS methane release. 

TechniCians needed to retneve the Sedi-
ments WIthOUt deformation of layers to accu-
rately reconstruct past dlmates. Some layers 
were about one meter thick with the consis-
tency of mud according to saentlsts aboard 
the research vessel, causing much difficulty. 

Imllal results suggest that the depositing of 
calbonate shells on deeper shells did not 
resume for at least SO,OOO years. The total 
recavery state would then take 100,000 years.

SARS concems could 
restrict int'I enrollment 

UCSD adopts 'wait and see' 
approach to summer session 

By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD will adopt a "wait and 
see" approach when deciding 
whether or not to enroll students 
from severe acute respiratory syn-
drome-affected regions for summer 
se sion classes, a committee decid-
ed on May 7. The decision follows 
UC Berkeley's decision ro restrict 
students from Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and China because of the increased 
severity of the disease. 

While on May 9, the University 
of California Office of ' the 
President issued more detailed 
guidelines regarding students from 
affected areas, it had said in a May 5 
statement that it "recommends that 
campus officials strongly consider 
suspending or postponing upcom-
ing programs hosti ng groups of sru-
dents from SARS-affecled coun-
tries or regions until travel advi -
sories are modified or rescinded." 

UC Berkeley, which holds classes 
on the semester system and has sum-
mer school students arriving in late 
May, initially restricted enrollment 
by all students from SARS-affected 
regions, but Berkeley Chancellor 
Roben M. Berdahl announced on 
May 10 that the university would 
admit about 80 students from China, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong for core 
academic classes. Berdahl said UC 
Berkeley will still hold off on the 
deci ion of enrolling around 500 
additional students in that campus' 
English as a Second Language pro-
gram run through extension. 

"We are able to do so because as 
of late yesterday, we have succeed-
ed in identifying and preparing suf-
ficient space to identify students 
who might present symptoms after 
arriving," Berdahl said. "We now 
have the capacity to deal with a 
limited number of enrollees from 
areas listed on the [Center for 
Disease Control] advisory." 

UCSD's summer session, which 
begins on June 30, only has about 
35 students from SARS-affected 
regions , all of whom are from 
Taiwan, according to Peter 
Thomas, director of international 
programs for UCSD Extension. 
The "wait and see" decision by the 
campus means that there will be no 
change in enrollment for students 
from those regions. 

The UCOP guidelines ro cam-
puses, issued on May 9, advises 
postponement of travel to affected 
countries and dictates that campus-
es receivi ng individuals from 
affected areas "take appropriate 
steps" to ensure that incoming stu-
dents monitor their own health, 
including taking their own temper-
ature on a daily basis and phone 
health care providers to set up an 
in-person checkup should they 
develop symptoms of the disease. 

"Individuals from countries that 
have an advisory in effect risk 
exporting SARS or becoming ill 
themselves during travel," said UC 
Vice President for Heal th Affairs 
Michael Drake. "We support the 
CDC recommendation to avoid 
nonessential travel."

College online offerings examined 
Expert talks of successful student services 

By CHRlmNE PM 
Staff Writer 

A presentation regarding 
online student services was made 
at the Career Services Center on 
May 9, featuring "E-Services in 
Higher Education" expert Robert 
Kvavik. 

Kvavik, an associate vice presi-
dent and vice provost for the 
University of Minnesota, spoke 
about improving student services 
mainly through the implementa-
tion of advanced Internet tech-
nology. 

UCSD Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed 
Spriggs was also present for the 
event and noted that such imple-
mentation is essential for "doing 
business more student and user 
friendly, in order to pursue edu-
cation in a more effective man-
ner." 

With the fine tuning of 
Internet programs for students, 
bener services will ease the com-
plications of managing the boom 
of enrollment growth and the cur-
rem budget pTOblems with more 
efficient systems that are at par 
with the latest advancements in 
integrating the Internet with stu-
dent services. 

An example of such a program 
is UCSD's StudentLink, which 
was first launched in 1996. The 
online service Web page offers an 
abundance of services to students 
such as individual e-mail accounts, 
class enrollment, viewing academ-
ic history, voting for campus eJec-
tions and a recent add-on that 
allows students to pay their bills. 

"There are always new 
improvements to make it easier 

for students and make the profits 
more seamless," said one member 
of the StudentLink Advisory 
Committee. "It's an ongoing 
process." 

One task that the committee 
hopes to fuI fill is the removal of 
the wait list option for classes 
since many academic deparunents 
do not offer a wait listing for class-
es anyway. 

Administrators across the 
nation are interested in expand-
ing their student services through 
the ever-growing technology of 
the Internet. Technological 

" The question is about 
raising the bar and doing 

it better, Sometimes 
we're not as quick as the 

students are. " 
- Robert KvaviJc. "E-Services in 

Higher Education .. expert 

advancement has made student 
services more conveniently acces-
sible according to some, but 
Kvavik noted otherwise. 

"It 's not about technology: it's 
how you do business," Kvavik 
said. "The culture on how to do 
business, and the culrnre that dri-
ves the busi ness. n 

As Kvavik noted, e-business is 
not limited to trade or careers, but 
created to "tailor to the local enVI-
ronment" of university student 
service. It includes "strategic plan-

ning analysis" as a managmg insti-
tution. 

Currently, 480 univerSity insti-
tutions have implemented online 
programs Similar to tudentLink. 
As an example of the extent in 
which these programs are utilized, 
Kvavik stated that the University 
of Minnesota's online srudem ser-
vice Web site receives 13,000 hits 
a month and four to five pages of 
material are downloaded on a 
daily basis. 

As the student population 
increases and the demands for 
effective student service esca-
lates, quality service becomes a 
priority. 

"There is a demand for cus-
tomer action and control, and 
there are rising expectations," 
Kvavik said. "The balance of 
power is shifting, and you have to 
deal with the way students want 
it." 

According to Kvavik, 80 per-
cent of all admission applications 
are completed online and 7S per-
cent of all university tudent ser-
vices are provided on the 
Internet. 

Although college students may 
appreciate online student service. 
there are condition in wruch per-
sonal and office assistance 's of 
more help. 

An example one member of 
the audience gave was when stu-
dents need psychological adVlce 
from an administration. 
Receiving coun cling from the 
Internet would reduce the sense 
of per onal help.

University Centers must expand 
despite protests, complaints 

Referendum would not meet 
students' needs; fee is too high 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

People can say a lot of things about 
the Price Center: that the automated 
paper towel dispensing machines are 
wasteful, that the resta uran ts are too 
expensive, that the lighting is too dark. 
I t's safe to say, though, that one of the 
loudest complaints about the Price 
Center is that it is JUSt tOO crowded . On 
any given weekday from around noon to 
2 p.m., the interior of the food court is 
bursting at the seams WIth crowds. Add 
a sprinkle or two of rain and the food 
court becomes a VIrtual bomb heller 
for scampering students . If that i n't 
problematic enough, Imagine that In 
even years the student pop-

ulation will bloat to some 

the plan, and it is doubtful to find any 
student who cannot find a use for such 
additions. The actual referendum text 
itself states, "a Building Advisory 
Committee, overseeing the planning, 
design, and construction of the expand-
ed facility, shall have at least two-thirds 
students and shall be co-chaired by a 
student." If that's not enough, the A.S. 
Council itself passed a resolution urging 
a "Yes" vote. As the voice of the under-
graduate student body, this fact cannot 
be brushed off as mere politics. 

As for wasteful use of fund, it is true 
that orne of the money gOlOg toward

By IESSICA UNGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

In what seems to be coming an 
annual bout of debate and debauchery, 
student voting on the University 
Centers Expansion and Renovation Fee 
Referendum is once again the center of 
attention. The issue of whether or not 
the referendum should be passed isn't so 
much about the concept, but rather the 
content. UCSD is a growing school in 
need of more space for student organi-
zations, improvement of existing facili-
ties and money for projects that are sim-
ply necessary for a university increasing 
In size and enrollment. 

Those opposing the referendum are 
not ignorant of the needs 
that the money would meet. 

able funding, especially when there 
have been no assurances that the cur-
rent tendency to use student funds for 
nonstudent resources will be changed. 

It could perhaps be argued that 
regardless of who is controlling the 
funds, there are certain needs that must 
be met. Beams in the Student Center 
are rotting and infested with bees . 
Meanwhile, the Price Center offers 
overpriced food, unused bits of tech -
nology that don't actually contribute to 
the academic environment and a lot of 
clutter and claustrophobia . But it can't 
be ignored that the arne people who 
have crea ted that wasteful glut are now 
asking for more funding. urely, if the 
situation is to be fixed, it will involve a 

new set of deci sion-makers. 
And certa inl y those deci-

They are mostly concerned 
with how the money is being 
raised and how it would be 
used. Already there has been 
reason to believe that the fee 
referendum should be voted 
down for three basic, but 

(ON sion-makers should at the very least be relying heavily on student input. The com-mittee that wrote the pro-posed referendum have bla-
tantly ignored student-dri -

inherently important rea-
sons. The referendum would be taking 
student money without student control, 
ha been marked by accusations of cor-
rupt behaVIOr and IS an overly expensive 
measure that doesn't look at other meth -
ods of cost-effectiveness. 

If tudcn15 are going to be asked to 
front the bill for the Price Center 
expansion, then they should undoubt-
edly have control over that money. 
Even more intuitively, tudents are the 
most capable of maJong deCIsion about 
what IS neees ary for the alleged

A glimpse into UCSD's future 
Sciences rule as vegans sent to detox 

Editor: 
As a member of the UCSD 

men's tennis program and long-
time reader of the GUllrdilln, I 
would like to express my disgust 
for the article, "Pum's Points," in 
the May 5 edition of the 
GUllrdian. 

This past weekend our team 
played Hawaii Pacific University 
in the second round of the 
NCAA playoffs for a chance to 
make UCSD history and attend 
the Final 16 tournament in 
Florida . To our 

" 

The article gOt worse as I 
read, as Kumar went on to say 
that Emil should learn from Jim 
Courier, one of the best 
American tennis players to live, 
making an extremely unfair 
comparison. He finished off the 
article by inaccurately saying 
that Emil retired and that he had 
lost his dignity. Emil did not 
retire, bur the match was 
stopped by Jan Tribbler (his 
opponent) himself who knew the 
team match was decided. What 
could be more insulting than the 

accusation of giv-
dismay, we were 
not able to 
accomplish our 
goal and lost the 
match 7-1. 
Adding insult to 
this, I picked up 
the Guardian on 
May 5 and read 
an article by Anu 
Kumar scrutiniz-
ing my teammate 
and brother Emil 
Novak. 

True men accept 
their losses, but 

never give up, Emil 
has always adhered

nonscholarship 
athletes, we play 
and fight for our 
own personal

the article full of 
inaccuracies, but 
it completely

because Kumar went further than 
this and made it a personal 
attack. He wrote that Emil was 
"flailing" on the court and "act-
ing out a dramatic theatrical 
scene." This implies that Emil 
was purposely faking his extreme 
physical circumstances. Emil 
began to cramp in the middle of 
the econd et and, because of 
this, was limited in his ability to 
move. Kumar made the implica-
tion that this was poor sports-
man hip because Emil never

petitor we have. In his match 
against Tribbler, he was put in an 
extremely tough situation with 
our team goi ng down 4-1. Emil 
was being very emotional, and he 
knew the urgency of his win. He 
knew that if he lost, our team's 
hopes of making school hi tory 
would be lost. Tribbler served 
for the match at 5-4, and Emil 
fought back winning four points

Flash forward to the year 2030. Not "two thousand and thirty," but "twenty-thirty." Fewer syl-
lables, sounds cooler. Let's move on. 

Under continual pressure to 
expand funding to the sciences 
under increasi ng budget pressure, 
UCSD has axed other programs 
left and right. Scrambling for fund -
ing, all humanities and social sci-
ences departments make a desper-
ate bid for survival. Some seek pro-
tection under the communication 
department's umbrella group. 

Due to the large payments of 
protection money from the grow-
ing Greek system, communication 
is able to weather the storm 
untouched. For frat boys and other 
genetic accidents of the nouveau-
riche, communications is the only 
major that can offer the sort of 
uncritical grading environment 
needed for proper esteem develop-
ment. As such, it has become a bud-
getary sacred cow. 

The once-illustrious theatre 
department was the first to go. Mer 
the North American Free Trade 
Agreement n, much of the prime 
acting talent went south to the cut-
ting-edge departments at UC 
MexicaJi , UC Cabo San Lucas and 
UC Offshore Oil Rig. It turns out 
that deep-sea divers have a taste for 
Bertolt Brecht th.at borders on the 
insatiable. Mer the failed fundra iser 
to save the department - a nude 
revue of "Waiting For Godot" 

showcasing the premier model of 
the Mitsubishi Galant in the role of 
Pozza - all hopes for the depart-
ment died. The tone of the show's 
reviews bordered on genocidal rage. 

At the commencement of bud-
get-cutting season, it was decided 
that all stage-related materials that 
could not be sold on 
bttp:IICTfligiist.(rmt would be melted 
down and used in the fashioning of 
the Next Generation Sun God stat-
ue, a giant bust of Chancellor Robert 
C. Dynes. The five theatre majors 
with the highest GPAs would be 
given three-month interns hi ps as 
local hockey team mascots, and 25 
runners-up would be entered in a 
fixed raffle for expired coupon books . 

" Jazz fans had to defend 
their music taste in public 
struggle sessions loaded 

with rabid Ja Rule 
fundamentnlists . " 

to the defunct Fins fish tacO eatery. 
At this point, what was left of the 

theatre department went under-
ground, cooperating with the Visual 
Arts Liberation Front and the scat-
tered emo guerrillas to stage 
impromptu mime-bys of lab scs-
sions, lilculty luncheons and campus 
tours. While UCSD students soon 
became relatively accustomed to the 
baffling political incorrectness of 
white face paint, incoming freshmen 
were terrified by the mimes' antics, 
often paranoid that the enore cam-
pus was teeming \vith a network of 

invisible walls, "claustrophobi a-
boxes" and trap-door elevators that 
led to underground torture cham-
bers. Only the torture chambers 
actually existed, but it was campus 
policy to tell all undergraduates that 
humans were only used in research 
when absolutely necessary and that 
they were always killed humanely. 

It was at this point that The 
Purge began. Community Service 
Officers were converted to several 
cadres of cultural sedition opera-
tives, armed with an array of non-
fatal weaponry and told to tear gas 
and subdue anyone speaking enthu-
siastically to strangers. Video cam-
eras used for any purpose otl. f· r than 
the making of "Jackass" and "Girls 
Gone Wild" imi tations were confis-
cated. Vegans were sent to 
detox. Gay men were forced to con-
form to "naming" stereotypes. Jazz 
fans had to defend their music taste 
in public suuggle sessions loaded 
with rabid Ja Rule 
fundamentalists. Rumors circulated 
of "Clockwork Orange" -like reedu-
cation camps, where women's eyes 
were forced open with botox to view 
Celine Dion Cellulite Aid telethons. 

Mer The Purge, the political cli-
mate began to change. There was a 
general feeling that the university 
had gone too far in suppressing dis-
sent. While even the most radical 
members of the administration 
grudgingly acknowledged that reviv-
ing the theater department was cam-
pus suicide, many also fel t that the 
role of theatre was valuable for pro-
moting cultural values and providing 
an oudet for student creativity. 

Finally, it was decided that the-
atre would be reestablished as a sub-

Pro: Fee would improve campus, student life 
continued {rOIn page 4 

awfully excessIve in the light of 
uch tiscal troubles. IIowever -

and this is integral to the expan-
sion referendum debate - the fee 
will not be collected until 2007. 
That' right, that's a full four 
years from now. 

inlllar to the RIMAe con-
strucrion a few year ago, the 
Improvements and exp:lI1 ion will 
be fully completed before any fee 
IS assessed. \ Vhat thi means is 
that the current student popula-
tion may very well see the fruit of 
the referendum before any 

money is handed over. Most of us 
will not have to pay anything, but 
will be able to acce s many of the 
improvements. As for the stu-
dents who do have to pay for it 
beginning in fall 2007 quarter, 
they will be amidst a much larger 
population that will see the justi-
fication for the accommodations 
even more than we do. And per-
haps four years from now, the 
money crunch at the university 
will be les oppressive and stu-
dents will not be faced with the 
continued cutbacks and tuition 
hikes that are currently being 

negotiated that make tl, is fee so 
difficul t for some to swallow. 

UeS D is already starting to 
fee l the growing pains of an explo-
sion in student population, as each 
comjng year seemingly tops the 
last in applications and is poised to 
continue for years to comc. The 
housing mess this year shows the 
po sible repercussions of lack of 
foresight on the part of the uni-
versity. As such, improving areas 
of the campus which are tanta-
mount to the vita lity of snldent 
life - the University enters-
are increasingly im portant to 

accommodate the masses of stu-
dents that will be gushing through 
Gi lman Dri ve. An affi rmative vote 
on the referendum wi ll get started 
on th is predicament right away. 
Regardless, however, of where 
students stand, it is important for 
them to sign onto StudentLink 
this week and vote. It may seem 
not to affect the livelihood of 
some students, e,pccially older 
ones, but it is essential for the 
body 3S a whole to point the direc-
tion of the university in the stu-
dents' way. If you want student 
control - well, there it is. 

Con: Cheaper alternatives were ignored 
conrmued {rom page 4 

although the rea ons for that 
potential increase are entirely 
separate from those of the pro-
posed fee , it should nOt be taken 
entirely out of context that this 
fee IS yet another request for 
more money from those least 
equipped to offer it: college Stu-
dents. 

Admittedly, the burden is slat-
ed to take effect in 2007, when 
this year' fee increase that was 
engineered to a sist in 
California's budget crisis wi ll be 
long forgotten . And as of yet, 
there has been no guarantee that 
the per-student increase of $11 7 
dollars will be covered by fi nan-
cial aid. And the fact that this ref-

erendum is to affect students in 
th e furure does not change the 
glaring lack of voice heard in the 
present. 

It 's possible tha t mo ney should

the content of the referendum 
matches its contcnt as a binding

Article neglected points 
about Iraq war 

Editor: 
In response to Du tin Frelich's 

" aysayers forced to pay the price" 
(May I, 2003) I would like to offer 
the Guard/Ol1 congratulations . 
Thank you for giving us an opll1jon 
so unresearched and bass-ackwards 
that uninvolved and apolitical peo-
ple like me feci rhe need to write in 
and ~ay our pIece. 

Freltch ob\~ousJy buys IJlto all 
the backpedaling the governmcnt 
has done. I would like to remind 
hlln that the reason Bush stJrtcd

IJlg to do Wlth liberation for Iral) . 
Instead, it had everything to do 
\vith disarming the country (Few, if 
any, weapons of ma~~ destruction 
have been found) . Also, 1 would not 
be thc first to note that while the 
war lover, the fighting is not yet 
finished. T he infrastructure of Iraq 
still needs to be rebuilt, and the 
many re idents are unhappy to see 
the United States as a presence in 
the country (See "U.S. troops, con-
servative religion a fiery combina-
tion in heartland town" Associated 
Press, May i , 2003). Dubya and his 
government have attempted to hj de 
the case of the missing weapons 
behind a nice picture of Saddam 
Hussei n 's statue toppl ing in 
Baghdad. 

I would encourage Frelich to 
take a look at all the news sources 
next time and perhaps even listen to 
the "extreme fri nge of the 

American public" he mentioned , 
who are wondering where the 
weapons of mass destruction are 
and asking what wi ll happen to Iraq 
now that the poli tica l fight has

percent m the next ten years. 

The children of our parents'

the enormous influx of students

" We have a responsibility 
to ensure that the tudents 

who come after us are 
able to enjoy the same 

quality of experience that 
we have had." 

- Devin W. Phillips, Registration 
Fee Advisory Committee Chair 

C D. The Caliform3 ~1.lSter 
PI.ln for I hgher EducJuon has 
111<111l1.lted that the UC S}"tCIIl pro-
Vide for the top 12 percent of Its 
high school graduates, and in order 
to fulfill that mandate, medlum-
sized ue campuses like U D 
must grow. 

As students of ue 0 today, we 
have a re ponsibility to ensure that 
the students who come after us are 
able to enjoy the arne quality of 
experience that we have had. A 
Price Center and Srudent Center, 
which are large enough to accom-
modate UCSD's projected popula-
tion, is an essentia l part of that 
experience. 

It i fo r th is reason that UCSD 
students must pass thjs proposed 
referendum to expand the 
University Centers. 

Over two years ago, the tudents 
of UCS D voted down an admi nis-
tration-in itiated referendum to, 
among other things, expand the 
University Centers. Immediately 

after the referendum's failure, Vice 
Chancellor Watson presented the 
admini stration's pl ans to the 
Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee. He outlined his plans 
to cut all student services funding 
by 10 percent, in order to pay for 
the University Centers expansion. 
After significant lobbying by the 
Registration Fce Advisory 
Committee and the councils of 
provosts and deans, Vice 

hanccllor Watson agrecd to post-
pone such a plan of budget cuts, In 
the hopes that student.~ would find 
another way to fund the expansion. 

That's what students did. 
Last year, A.S. President Jeff 

Dodge initiated an A.S. Task force 
designed to explore ways to deal 
with the projected population 
increase at UCSD. This task force 
included representatives from all 
over UCSD, from the socia ted 
Students, the Graduate Student 
Association, the six colleges, the 
tudent cooperatives and the 

University Centers. Through a 
consensus-based decision-making 
proces , the task force decided that 
the best way to handle UC D's 
impending crisis was through a stu-
dent referendum. 

This referendum is not only 
necessary for the quality of life here 
at UCSD, but it is also a product of 
student agency and initiative. 
Passmg this referendum will ensure 
that student services are not 
impacted by budget cuts made to 
fund a University Centers expan-
sion. 

There is also sometlling to say 
abollt the broad student support for

A Mother's Day to remember Marshall students 
compete to conserve 
Energy-saving contest 

rewarded with tunnel tour 
ByUSAMAK 

Staff Writer 

For the entire month of May, 
Thurgood Marshall College resi -
dents will be competing in an ener-
gy conservation and recycling con-
test. Each residentia l bui lding is 
competing to conserve the most 
energy, and the winning building 
will get a chance to take a tour of the 
underground tunnels at UCSD. 
The residential halls, Marshall 
Uppers and Lowers Apartments are 
also competing against each other in 
a recycling contest 

remind her roommates to con-
serve energy. 

" I think energy conservation IS 
incredibly important, especially 
for tho e in on-campus housing," 
Wurden said . "Since utilities are 
included in the housing cost, many 
students take the cost of electriCity 
for granted. This contest i defi-
nitely giving me some new habits 
that will not only benefit the envI -
ronment, but will also come in 
handy upon living off-campus." 

The recycling contest pits the 
residence halls against the two 
Marshall apartment areas. Each 
area ha two bins in a specific loca-
tion - one for paper and the other 
for plastic, aluminum and glass 
beverage containers. The bins wi ll 
be weighed to determine which 
area recycled the most.

For the energy conservation 
contest, each building's energy out-
put for this month will be mea-
sured and compared to the energy 
output for the month of February. 
I n an effort to remain fair for 
buildings with fewer residents, a 
ratio will be calculated by dividing 
the output difference by the num-
ber of residents in the building. 
The building with the highest 
amount of energy saved per resi-
dent will win the contest. 

Isaac Pearlman, a Marshall resi-
dential advisor who came up with 
the contest idea, said the prize for 
this COntest is yet to be determined. 
Possibilities include renting out the 
AMC La Jolla Theater for a 
screening of "The Matrix: Online: Interhet student services discussed Students have been pursuing 

different str3tegies to save energy 
for the contest. Katie Wurden, a 
Marsha ll freshman, and her apart-
ment-mates have been unplugging 
TVs and VCRs when the app li-
ances are not in use, using only 
one light while showering and 
putting their computers in sleep 
mode.

sus self service on the Internet, the 
latter is preferred. 

"We have some srudents who 
would rather do it personally, but 
we find mo t students are interest-
ed in using the online service," 
Kvavik said. 

The presentation also raised 
the subject of online textbook ser-

vices raking away profits from uni-
versity book stores. Kvavik noted 
that Web sites like htrp:II'IJIWW. text-
hoob.cum have an "enormous com-
petitive advantage." 

Because of this factor, univer-
sity-affiliated textbook sales on 
the Internet is advocated, not 
only to benefit the university in 
terms of profits, but to provide 

better options for the student as 
well. 

As more and more services are 
provided, a threshold that limits 
students' demands becomes an 
Issue. 

"The question is about raising 
the bar and doing it better," 
Kvavik said. "Sometimes we're 
not as quick as the students are." 

NO STUDENT CONTROL

notes around the apartment to 

WE ARE THE ONES THAT SHOULD DECIDE HOW OUR MONEY IS SPENT 

Pearlman said he came up with 
the idea for these contests from 
seeing residents wasting energy, 
water and recyclable material . As 
an environmental systems major, 
Pearlman himself has been dedi-
cated to recycling since before col-
lege, and he i also trying to watch 
his energy usage. His strategie~

" I figured if we could give res-
idents an incentive to conserve, 
they can hopefully see how easy it 
is and that they can easily make a 
difference," Pearlman said. "Also,

tion skills for when they move

event. 
"With our budget crisis, we're 

looking at all kinds of ways to save 
money," said Marciano Perez, 
assistant residential dean for 
Marshall college. "] think this is a 
great way for students to help out 
with the budget crisis." 

A free barbecue and concert 
will take place on May 29 to 
announce the winners of each con-
test. Pearlman also hopes to have 
tables \vith information from stu-

dent environmen-

Pearlman 
organized the 
event with the 
help of the 
Marshall residen-
tial deans, pro-
gramming 
interns and the 
other residential 
advisors - all 
who have been 
highly supportive 
of the idea. 

Since utilities are 
included in the 

tal organizations at 
the concert, along 
with a showcase of 
hybrid cars and 
demonstrations

company. housing cost, many 

students take the 
cost of electricity far 

According to 
Perez, the event 
will be evaluated 
at the end of the 
month. If the 
results are posi-
tive, the contests 
could potentially 
be made an annual 
event, possibly

it's just for the sake of conserv-
ing," said Steve Geist, a third-year 
programming intern at Marshall 
who helped coordinate the event 
among the residential advisors. 

Other administrative members 
have also been receptive to 
Pearlman's idea. Gary Matthews, 
assistant vice chancellor in charge 
of the AuxiJiary and Plant Services, 
and Steve Benedict, director of the 
Environment, Health and Safety 
Department, have both agreed to 
donate $250 to the contests. The 
UCSD Recycling Department has 
also enthusiastically supported the 

including the 
other colleges at UCSD and other 
universities in the area. 

"When I first developed the 
idea, I thought of it as something 
that could be a fun annual event," 
Pearlman said. "And the pleasant-
ly surprising support we've had 
this year from the administration 
... adds to my hope that in the 
future, this could become an 
inter-campus competition. But 
first we JUSt have to concentrate 
on making this year successfuJ."

Lecture Notes. 

The initial plan, which mem-
bers of the A.S. Council present-
ed to the C/CPC on April 24, 
proposed that the ropes course be 
located in the eucalyptus grove 
across Hopkins Drive from 
RIMAC Arena. According to A.S. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher, 
the plan was rejected because of 
potential environmental ramifica-
tions that the ropes course might 
have on that specific area . 

Gallagher, A.S. Commissioner 
of Enterprise Operations Jeremy 
Cogan and former Commissioner 
of Athletics Robin Shelton were 
involved in the plan 's develop-
ment. Members of the Campus 
Planning Office and the recre-
ation department were also 
involved in the process. The 
group's proposal originally called 
for the removal of six trees, but 
when presen ting the plan to the 
CICPC, the group agreed to 
lower the number of trees 
removed to one, Gallagher said. 

"The ClCPC liked the idea 
but were not in favor of the loca-
tion," Gallagher said. "We're 
regrouping, and we're going to 
figure out a new location and 
move forward ." 

Recreation affiliates and AS. 
Council members will be looking 
at other potential locations for the 
ropes course and will formulate a 
new proposal in fall 2003, accord-
ing to Cogan. Alternate locations 
in the original proposal included 
an area north of the Spanos Center 
and an are:! in Pepper Canyon. 
The Spanos Center site was unfa-
vorable because of its proximity to 
Genessee Avenue, while the 
Pepper Canyon site was too steep

and might be used for a light tran-
sit line in the future, Cogan said. 
However, both si tes will be recon-
sidered for the next proposal. 

The ropes course would be 
designed for student, faculty, staff 
and external group use. The stu-
dent admission price would be 
about $10 to $15, according to 
Gallagher. Faculty and staff use of 
the course would cost slightly 
more . However, both prices 
would be well below a typical 
ropes course's admission price, 
Cogan said. 

"With over 350 student orgs 
on campus, we could really impact 
the university," Gallagher said. 

The ropes course would cost 
about $120,000 to construct, with 
A.S. Reserves and the recreation 
department splitting the co t at 
$60,000 apiece, Gallagher said. 
Profits from the ropes course 
would be split at a ratio of 65 to 
35 percent between recreation 
and the Associated Students, 
respectively, according to Cogan. 

The ropes course would be 
about 30 to 50 feet high and 
would be built around siJl poles. 
Gallagher said it could be built in 
only two weeks. 

The recreation departmen t 
approached the A.S. Council with 
the idea of a joint-sponsored 
ropes course. Several other uni-
versities, including California 
State University and other 
University of California campus-
es, opera te ropes courses. 

The ClCPC advises the chan-
cellor on matters of pnysical cam-
pus and surrounding community 
development. 

Members of the ClCPC and 
the recrea tion deparonent coul d 
not be reached for comment.

"We have fought to get that 

position reclassified from an 
administrative assistant to a student 
affairs officer," Fleming said. "The 
position is currently vacant, and we 
want to fill it with someone who 
will help the organization grow." 

Lovejoy sai d the remaining 
monies from the budget change~ 
will be in the general request fund 
for Fall 2003 . 

According to Amlrnovm, the 
Office of Graduate Stud ,es and 
Research provides fundmg for 
other graduate program gradua-
tions. 

However, as a rule, they do not 
provide funding to professional 
school commencement events. 
Amirnovin said that the medical 
school is the only graduate depart-
ment that is not included in the 
OGSR. 

The $2 ,400 cut from the G A 
budget is only a fraction of the 
cost of the medical school gradu-
ation events, which will total 
about $20,000 . 

However, Amirnovm said that 
the GSA funding is used to offset 
an extensive amount of fundrais-
ing done by the medical students 
that is necessary to pay for the 
commencement banquet. 

Despite this year's line-item 
cuts, these departments are invited 
to make a request from the general 
request fund next fall for a reason-
able and justified amount of fund-
ing, Lovejoy said. 

Representatives from IRiPS 
were not available for comment.

Although A.S. e lecti ons ended last mon th, stu -dents have the opportuni -ty to cast yet another vote 
this week that is crucial to deciding 
the fate of student recreational areas 
on campus. During the entire week 
of May 12, students can vote to 
accept or reject the proposed Price 
Center and Student Center 
Expansion Referendum. 

The referendum calls for an addi -
tional fee of $39 dollars per quarter 
for university ruition to cover the 
cost of renovation and expansion in 
both these popular, yet crowded stu-
dent centers on campus. However, if 
the proposal gets a majority of the 
needed 20 percent of the student 
population to be considered a valid 
vote (which is about 4,400 students 
of the total student population of 
about 22,000), the fec would not 
actually be charged to students until 
2007, when the expan ion is project-
ed to be complete. 

The student populat ion at U SD 
IS growing by about 1,000 srudents 
per year, meaning there will be 
approximately 30,000 students in 
20 I O. The current University 
Centers facilitie were not designed 
to accommodate the needs of 30,000 
s rudents . The proposed expansIOn 
will include refurbishing current 
facilities as well as the construction 
of additional space fo r bu ine es 
and rudent organizations. 

In the Price enter, there would 
be a N -hour rudy lou nge with a 
computer lab, group study rooms 
and resources for commuter stu-
dents such a lockers and a kitchen. 
In respon e to rudent reque {S, the 
restaurant pace ava Il able would be 
gIven to some late-night restaurants, 

including one connected to the 24-
hour study lounge. 

There would also be more variety 
in food offerings. Though unable to 
ensure any specific restaurants, the 
referendum language promises 
healthy, low-cost options will be 
available in the Pri ce Center. T here 
would be a mixture of srudent-run 
co-op organizations and commercial 
re tauunts. Additional indoor and 
outdoor dining-area seati ng would 
be added to circumvent the ove r-
crowding during peak meal times. 
The plans for the expanded Price 
Center also include a grocery store, 
retail spaces to accommodate busi-
ne ses such as a hair stylist, full -ser-
vice bank and an expanded full -ser-
vice post office. 

In addition to expansion, the 
Student Center, which was built in 
the early 1970 - not long afte r 
UCSD opened - would undergo an 
exterior renova tion as well. A prior-
ity for such renovation includes 
improved lighting for more safety in 
the area. T he Grove Caffe would be 
expanded to include more interior 
dining seati ng, and there are plans to 
move the General Store to a larger 
location just north of Porter's Pub. 
Soft Reserves and Lecture otes 
would al 0 become larger to accom-
modate the growing demands of a 
growing student popul ation. 

At both Univer ity enters there 
would be additional space allotted for 
new snldent o rganizanon offices, as 
well as renovations of currently exist-
ing spaces. There would al 0 be more 
space designed specifically for hold-
ing student events and programming 
than i currently available.

Conversing 
openly: is 

there sexual 
freedom? 

let's talk 
About sex 

Jessica Lingel 

I t ju t so happens that my friend and I have the arne vibrator. We happened to be talking 
about the various pros and cons 
about this vibrator on the phone. 
She was frustrated that it only went 
one speed. I advised her to play 
around \\'ith the on switch, which if 
properly fines ed can actually pro-
duced two speed . She hung up, 
happy to have a whole new option 
available to her. I hung up to face a 
crowd of stunned bystanders. look-
ing at me as if I'd actually been 
using my vibrator instead of talk-
ing about it. 

Perhaps, I shouldn't nave had a 
private conversation in front of a 
bus stop. Perhaps, it was simply a 
case of being a somewhat liberally-
minded individual surrounded by 
extremely conservative prude . 
And perhaps. it's an example of 
people needing to loosen up when 
it comes to sex and to open up to 
the idea that sexuality is something 
to be embraced. nor condemned. 

What ever happened to the sex-
ual revolution? What ever hap-
pened to the promised liberation of 
o ur bodies, and what we did with 
them' The societal freedom of the 
1960s and 1970s, the an ti-war 
protests, the feminist movement, 
an increasing acceptance of homo-

exuality all seemed to indicate thai 
a certain amount of experimenta-
tion was simply a part of elf-dis-
covery. 

Flash forward thirty years and 
we're in another war that many 
find suspect. instead of not objecti-
fymg women, we objecnfy both 
genders and homophobia is sti ll 
running rampant. And the kind of 
sexual freedom that once appeared 
to be JUSI a ex talk away is now 
deemed unacceptable behavior. 

To some extent, dus is probably 
explained by the Influx of STD 
made public in the early 19905. 
T he awareness o f A.I .D.S., HIV, 
Human Papilloma Viru and many 
others often depended on scare 
tactics rather than information. 
Deadly diseases certainly m ent a 
certain amount 0 fear. But not to 
the extent that people should be 
afraid even to discuss it. Indeed, 
perhaps one of the best methods of 
prevenllng such diseases is not 
spreading fear, but rather open dIS-
cussion that could dispel rumors 
in tead of encouraging them 
through whispered gossip s tem-
ming from ignorance. 

There :S a difference be tween 
lewd, tactless dutchal and earnest, 
CuriOUS conversation. There's a dif-
ference between bragging a bout

Expansion: steps to proposed innovation 
continued from page II 

Much of the construction 
would start around 2005. after it 
is designed and approved by a 
Building Advisory Committee. 
Although there will be represen-
tatives from several administra-
tive departments, two-thirds of 
the committee would be made up 
of students. However, some of 
the office renovations could 
begin as early a this summer. 

The niverSitY Center 
Advisory Board claim the con-
struction will cause minimal 
Impact on tudent life. The exist-
mg services will remain open and 
work on student orga ni zation 
paces would be Jone duri ng the 

summer, while they are inactive. 
The process of the actual con-

struction may seem small in com-
parison to the complex course of 
actIOn that has been taken to even 
prepare a proposal for the stu-
dent body to be able to vote on. 
The planning for the referendum 
that students will pass or reject 
this week began almost two years 
ago. 

According to UCAB Chair 
James Lynch, the expansion 
process was initiated in 
December of 200 I, by then-A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge and then -
A.S. Vice President Internal Jenn 
Brown. The two are reported to 
have collaborated in composing a 
charter document that outlined 
the procedure. 

Jessica Horton/Guord.,n 
CAmp1il"inl: Students educate others on the pros and cons for voting on the PfOPOSed expansion fee referendum. 

Once the charter was com-
pleted, the next step was to create 
a task force. comprised of various 
tudent and faculty repre enta-

tion from each of the colleges, 
UCAB (of which 50 percent must 
be students). the co-ops and the 
Cross Cultural Center, among 
other student organizations. The 
task force was intended to over-
see the development of this 
involved procedure. 

Every tudent senator was con-
sidered an ex-officio member of the 
taskforce. However, much to 
Lynch's disappointment, many 
never attended their meetings. only 
recently voicing opposition to the 
expansion. 

"Students definitely had the 
opportunity to comment on it, but 
no one took initiative until the ref-
erendum wa about to go on the 
bailor," Lynch said. "They made 
no effort to work with it at the 
time. and now they claim their 
voices aren't heard." 

Several members of the oppo i-
tion to the referendum declined to 

comment on this issue, but instead 
direct students to their Web site, 
hit p:/ /www.studen fcontrol.arg, 
which emphasizes the importance 
of maintaining student autonomy 
over student fees to keep already 
outrageous costs as low as possible. 

T he expansion taskforce then 
faced the challenge of determining 
ways to assess students' interest in 
the expansion. They surveyed a 
total of over 3,000 students. 
including both graduates and 
undergraduates, to fi nd out el(actly 
what kinds of new places students 
would desire to see available for 
use in an el(panded Price Center 

and Student Center. The surveys 
were conducted partia lly by tele-
phone and largely by Internet, 
thoroughly questioning a random 
sample of students. 

Many of the questions that 
were most usefu l to the task force 
touched on students' sen itivity 
to paying additional fees . 
However, the surveys reported 
tha t most students were willi ng 
to pay the highest-proposed fees 
on the Web site to receive the 
projected benefits of expanded 
university centers.

Students compete in argumentation 
Speech and debate team is young but successful 

By CHRImNE PAl 
Staff Writer 

Prominent leaders such as 
1arnn Luther King Jr., Malcolm 

X.John F. Kennedy and others have 
channeled their deeply rooted 

belie~ 10 the public through their 
brilliant ski lls in debate. Such a gift 
of being able to vOice opInions and 
belllg able to a rgue them can be 
attained through academic organi-
zations such as speech and debate, 
which can condition one's ability to 
SpelIx well . 

The peech and delnte team at 
UCSD aims. according to their 
Web site, to ~improve the public 
peaking, critical thinking, argu-

mentation skills and the self confi-
dence of irs members and to help 

promote these slaUs throughout the 
university." 

Closely imilar to speech and 
debate in nigh school, this UCSD 
academic organization consists of 
Parliamentary debate teams and 
speech teams, which branch out 
into imprOVised peech, interpreta-
Don of poetry and other linuted 
preparaoon events. 

Ind iVidual teams in UC D 
Speech and Debate have been 
ranked 35th naoonWide and have 
won nwncrous awards, notably this 
past 2002-03 season with teams 
placing in finals at the Fresno, 
Azusa Pacific and CSU orthridge 
invitationals. 

In parliamentary debate, many 
political issues are argued, talong 
heed of considering both sides of

the issue. Some issues debated in 
the past include the U .S- govern-
ments funding of stem cell 
research, national missile defense 
and this past season's hot topic of 
the war in Iraq. 

UCSD Speech and Debate is a 
fairly new team, officially compet-
Ing in 1992 while the current team 
start out In 1999 with just five mem-
bers. Yet III the next few years, the 
team expanded with its natural 
momentum. 

"We've been competing for 
about four yeus, and at that time 
we were student run," said Danny 
Cantrell , Thurgood Marshall 
College senior and president of the 
team. "It was a real pleasant atmos-
phere because we all taught each 
other." 

The team blossomed frOIll a sin-
gle team to ix parliamentary debate 
tearns dunng the 200 1 season after 
the novice and]V teams placed sec-
ond in Modesto, Calif., and third in 
Point Loma. 

For many members, being on 
the team has parlced amblOon, and 
prepares them for their futures. 

"I t1unk the reason why I wantlo 
go to law school is beca~e I do 
debate," said member and Marshall 
freshman Abigail MillOn. " I thJl1k 
most of the people on the team now 
want to go to law school, and I 
believe law !>Chools look at Idebate 
on your record] . We've had 
instlnces when you see debaters 't 
out for jolY.. where they speclfi ally 
look for debate, and a lot of It i for 
lcareers in] busin ,dipl macy and 
public poliCY." 

For many rudents. JOining the 
delntc team may seem not only 
intimiJating, but time consuming 

as well . But the benefits that arise 
from practicing debate are aid to 
be worth it. 

"I definitely think that debate is 
a worthwnile activity. It improves 
your communication skills, argu-
mentation skills and quick thinking, 
wnich are key throughout life and 
are all needed in the busi ness 
world," antrell said. 

Many of today's youth can be 
highly opinionated, ranging from 
cia hing political stances to the 
rights of etlmic groups. J laving an 
opinion is one thing, but being able 
to express it with power and III a 
vibrant tone is another. 

"Ln terms of being able ro aroc-
ulate yourself, spealcing your opin-
ion and arguing logica lly, I believe it 
applies to JUSt about everything you 
do," said Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Raj Kumar. 

Regarding the differences 
between high school debate and 
debate here in UCSD, Kumar ~ald, 
"I didn 't like one more than the 
other, It Just had different Jem:lmi!.. 
Ilere it:S not a question of outdolllg 
anybody, It' more of a qu~oon of 
helping Ollt the team and 111 Ih,lt 
way, it's act\lally bener." 

Cantrell nmed thai despite the 
tcm.e arcn,1 of college debate , It 
IruJlntalllS Its SOCiable ~Ide. 

"Its a IInle lJit more compeutlve, 
hut Il '~ also Illore laid back Jt the 
sallie ume. We're mainly there to 
have a good time," Cantrell S3IJ. 

Most tournaments are held over 
ule weekend, usually on Saturda~ 
and ' undays. 

"'Inc almO phcrc is pretty 'lock 
back at the tournaments," Milton

Ambition to think beyond college 
AEP offers career networking options 

By ANNIE YANG 
Contributing Writer 

A student and his professor 
casually chat about the day's events 
over a cu p of coffee before they 
begin to engage in a serious con-
versation urrounding the tudent's 
research Ii ndings. 

Another student, thinking about 
attending medical school, interacts 
with a physician in an Diego to 
gain insight about the profession 
while experiencing the worlcing 
environment of a health care clinic. 

A group of student scholars take a 
tour of a local high-tech company to 
better understand the working con-
ditions of a site at wh.ich they might 
consider working in the near furure. 
These tudents mend UC D, and 
uch occasions are all part of the 

Academic Ennchment Program 
experience that more than 1,200 stu-
dents take advantage of yearly. 

The AEP, which wa e tablished 
in 1989 by Joseph , arson, vice 
chancellor of student a ffairs, now 
consISts of even programs that are 
closely connected with each other, 
but differ in size, objective and tu-
dents served . Each of the programs 
in the AEP serve undergraduate 
students who are thinking about 
a ttending graduate or professional 
school by providing them with 
research opportunities and other 
academic enrichment experiences 
beyond the classroom. 

"[ think the idea of AEP has been 
consistent over the years," said 
David Artis, director of AEP. "The 
AEP staff and our supporters among 
the faculty, adminisD'ation and com-
muruty believe that students consid-
ering graduate or professional school 
will benefit j,'Teatly from the experi-
ence of menrored research in all 
fields, or expo ure to workmg condi-
tions in the sciences or medicine.» 

Students who paroClpate In one 
of four individual research-oriented 
programs within the AEP have the 
opportunity to perform research

where they attend seminars on how 
to ",me and present a research paper, 
receive graduate school and fellow-
ship information, Witness the routine 
of scholarly life and participate in 
many more enrich.ing activities. 

Research programs are designed 
III conjunction with the smdents' 
resea.rch interests. Students have the 
opportunity to work closely \vith a 
UCSD fAculty member who serves 
both as a role model and a mentor. 

"All who complete these pro-
grams hould be in a position to 
receive enthusiastic and thorough 
leners of recommendation from 
their mentors," Artis said. 

Through the Faculty 
Mentorship Program, students 
have the opportunity to present 
their findings at the annual FMP 
Research Sympo ium that ukes 
place at the end of the academic 
year. tudents work as research 
assistants to UC D faculty mem-
bers for a t least ten hours per week 
for two quarters and receive four 
units of independent swdy credit 
for each of the quarters. 

"This program gave me the 
opportunity to learn more about 
research with legitimate training 
Instead of just looking at books," aid 
Stella Chern, a FMP alumnus and 

Eleanor Roosevelt College eni or. 
The UC Leadership and 

Excellence through Advanced 
Degrees in Science program, with 
the goal to develQp future leaders 
of California in government, indus-
try and academia, gives tudents 
the opportunity to partake in two 
years (including two summers) of 
mentored research and scholarly 
activities. One summer of research 
experience is conducted at UCSD 
while the other is completed at 
another UC campus . UC 
L.E.A.D.S. students have a strong 
interest in pursuing a doctoral 
degree in math or science at a U 
campu . Also, UC L.E. .D.S. 
scholars travel to rc~earch confer-
ences at other U , campuses.

Program. The SRI' is a rughly com-
petitive program that provides

Graduate Record Examination 
training for all jUniors and se;Uors.

income and first-generation college 
students or underrepresented 
minority junior and seniors WIth a

strong interest in obtaining a doc-
toral degree in any field. 

The program's main oblective is

Life doesn't end in 
your 20s, ladies 

Julia Bourland's new sur .. 
vival guide for 20 year aIds 

By VAURIE NG 
Staff Writer 

In a society in which young 
women feel pressured to idolize 
and model themselves after glam-
orous celebrities, it is difficult for 
them to embrace the uniqueness 
that makes them special. But as col-
lege women enter their 20s, they 
struggle with both their identities 
and with life. Reality definitely 
doesn't rrurror many of the images 
seen on television and in movies, 
depicting people as beautiful, thin 
and having nothing to worry about. 

Julia Bourland, the author of 
"The Go- irl Gwde: Surviving our 
ZOs with Savvy, oul and Style," 
spoke with a group of young women 
as part of o.b.U lndie Days on April 
21 on the importance of indiVIduali-
ty and getting the most out of life, 
especially during your 20s. The full-
time freelance writer and former 
associate editor of Parenting knows 
a thing or two about the subject. IIcr 
writing, which has appeared in 
major magazines such as Shape, 
Parenting and 

" 

ketable in business and give you 
relationsh.ip slcills," shc said. 

Bourland also discussed factors 
that could discourage women from 
embracing their uniqueness. 

"The media and Hollywood 
present images of women that 
don't look anything like us - that 
are similar and perfect. When we 
are consta ntly confronted with 
these images, we wonder why our 
bodies aren 't represented, and it is 
difficult [Q be happy in your own 
skin," she sa id. 

Bad body images are often trig-
gered by such images and life expe-
ri ences. 

"Jealou y also discourages 
women from being individuals," 
she said. ''It dampens ambitions 
and indiVIduality and won't let you 
go after what you want." 

She al 0 noted that low self-
esteem is another barrier to cele-
brating life. 

"Loneliness is another detri-
ment to expressing individuality. 
With changes going on - people 
changing and a support system 

reinvents itself - it 
osmopo l itan, 

focuses on celebrat-
ing the individual 
spiri t and go-getter 
attitude, empower-
ingwomen and giv-
ing them the confi-
dence and ability to 
feel sure about 
themselves. 

Bourland wrote 
"The Go- irl 

The media and 
Hollywood present 
images of women 

that don't look 
anything like US." 

leads to desires to 
conform, become 
part of a group you 
don't feel support-
ed in, and discour-
ages individuality," 
he said. 

Guide" at the age _ Julia Bourland. author 
of 29, in the hopes of "The Go-Girl Guide'" 

In dealing with 
selbacks, BourianJ 
encourages women 
[0 "be themselves 
and feel comfort-
able in their own 
skin. You should 
trust your elf and of putting together 

a ulllver al glllde 
for what the 20s are all about. 
Although the 20 are "a fa ntastic 
decade," he notes that it does not 
come without its frustrations. 

"Having gone through my 20s, [ 
realized there wasn 't a guide to deal 
with the issues, litre how to manage 
your finances, the climb women go 
through in their careers and the 
discouragements they go through. 
I hadn't expected the challenges. I 
thought life would be like a 
'Friends' episode," she said . 

After turning 28 and having 
been through the difficult stage of 
her 20, he realized that there was 
a lot she could do to help other 
women. Soon, she began to take 
the teps to make "The Go-Girl 
Guide" a reality. 

In preparing the book, Bourland 
spoke wi th women and experts 
about relationsh.ips, careers, finances 
and friendships women find 111 their 
20s. he combined this with hlllnor 
and hopeful anecdutes to give the 
guide a pt'Cial lOuch. Most of the 
feedba k Bourland has received on 
her book has come from customer 
reviews on Amawn.com. 

"The feedback on Amawn.com 
has been amazing," he aid. "(The 
customers I feel that it' so great to 
hear about other women goi ng 
through the same challenges and 
how they dealt with il. It's encour-
aging (for me) to know that the 
book i helping other women." 

Attributes that are often 
thought of as flaws can al 0 COIl -
tribute to one's uniqueness, she 
said . 

"People often confuse fl aws 
with individuality," Bourland said. 
"Even the smallest things can make 
you a unique person and eparate 
you from everyone el;e 111 busint'Ss, 
acadcmlcs and relationships. 
Knuw1l1g how unique you are is a 
valuable assel." 

She cncollrage; womcn to rc -
ognlze dnd I>ehevt! In thClf ulllquc 
tr.lIl' 

"'Illey make (youl more 1l1Ar-

take risks - as 
many as possible. Surround your-
self with supportive friends and rel-
atives, and stay away from people 
who pressure you to conform and 
are not supportive. It will help you 
get through the rough times." 

Some students were atD'acted to 
the subject of the event. 

"1 came out of interest. It seemed 
like an interesting topic," said 
ReveUe College junior Lacy Hines. 

Others had been inspired by 
Bourland's book. 

"It was really good and thought-
ful," said John Muir College junior 
Amanda Miller. "She shared a lot 
of her experiences and put a lot of 
hard work into it." 

Bourland' next book, "Hitched: 
The Go-Girl Guide to the First Year 
of Marriage," wh.ich deals with the 
changes women go through in their 
identities after marriage, will be 
relea ed in June. I [er next project, a 
go-gul guIde to nesong, will be 
more fWl and lighter than her preVI-
ous work. This time, the focus will 
be on turning a house or apartment 
into a cozy and creative sanCtuary. 

Currently, Bourland is living 
her dream of being a full -time 
writer. With the same attitude and 
per pective, other young women 
may also be able to accomplish 
what they want in life while allow-
ing themsclves to seek out the 
attributes that make them unique.

Uniting religions with 
an all-encompassing 

Interfaith Center 
Proposal for faith center to 

bring people together 
By RUTH KOGEN 

Staff Writer 

Currently, UCSD has everal 
resource centers available to stu-
dents and the community. The e 
include facilities like the Women's 
Center, the Cross Cultural Center 
and the Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Resource Office. In 
200 I, a group was formed to over-
see the creation of an additional 
location for information: an 
Interfaith Center. 

According to Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore 
Emily Allen, the proposed center 
would serve the spiritual needs of 
students with spaces for student 
organizations to hold meetings and 
events pertaining to religious orga-
nizations. There would be informa-
tional resources and personnel 
available to help integrate students 
into the university to give counsel 
and guidance, to create an inter-
faith network and to educate 
inquiring students about different 
faiths. 

"The committee sees an inter-
faith center as expanding the 
kinds of resources available to stu-
dents," said Allen, who was cho-
sen to attend the Interfaith Center 
Advocacy Committee meetings as 
a represen tative of 
the Methodist stu-
dent community 
(the Wesley 
ChrIstian 
Fellowship). 

The committee 
also enjoys upport 
from 10 other reli-
giou group on 
campus, several 
professors and faces 
no official opposi-
tion. The main 

" 

most important purpose of the cen-
ter will be that people from differ-
ent faith traditions will be "rubbing 
elbows" with each other because 
they will share space in tight quar-
ters. 

"I think that the more people 
get to know and understand one 
another. The greater the chance for 
collaboration, understanding and 
respect," Neu aid. 

Many religious groups have 
permanent space in the area sur-
rounding the university. However, 
members of the committee find 
this to be insufficient to support 
the large campus religious com-
munity. 

"It's difficult for first years," said 
Angela Santos, John Muir College 
senior and repre entative of the 
Catholic Student Commwuty. She 
claims that the lnterfaith Center 
would be a place for different groups 
on campus to come together as peo-
ple of faith. 

The proposed Interfaith 
Center would include a kitchen, 
several conference room, an 
office, a quiet space and bath-
rooms in or near the facility. As 
UC 0 currently stand, there i 
not enough room for individual 
student organization meeting 
spaces, let alone a permanent 

facility dedicated 
to religious orga-
nizations. ICAC i 
therefore pre Cnt-
Iy putting all of it~ 
efforts behind 
promoting the 
upcommg fee re -
erendum vote that 
will take place this 
week. 

"A 20 percent 
voter turn Ollt i;. 
needed for the 

obstacles in the way 
of creating this 
facility are money 
and space. Though 
the project was 
originally stalled 20 
years ago due to 
issues surrounding

church and state, 
there is great

Allen aid. "This 
amounts to 4,400 
students. I believe 
a failed referenda 
is generally ca used 
by poor voung

university needs a 
clear mandate

Interfaith Centers

ties.

Community at UCSD 

either way before 
it can take action 
on the expan ion 

According to 
Kimberly Mer ch, member of 
Catholic Community at UCSD 
and leader of ICAC, there are 
over 14 public universitie that 
have Interfaith Centers, including 
UC Irvine. The issue with the 
separation between church and 
sta te is tha t there is no issue 
according to Mersch. An 
Interfaith Center is not designed 
to promote any religion, but 
rather be a spiritual resource cen-
rer. 

There are currently 41 religIOUS 
student organizations registered 
on campus, which causes difficul -
ties III reserving rooms for large 
events. 

Wlule this lack of space affects 
all studem organizations, "religJOu 
organization are particularly hard 
rut becau e the nature of their pur-
pose often leads them to meet on a 
weekly or even dally ba IS for 
prayer, scrtpture tudy or olher

~ald.

and ICAe member, feel. th t the 

... whichever way 
students feel about the referen-
dum, voting is the way to express 
that opinion." 

However, the wording of the 
University Centers referendum 
does not specifically include 
plans to dedicate part of the expan-
sion to an Interfaith Center. 
According to Mersch, former A.S. 
President Jenn Brown referred 
ICAC to the IlIversity Center 
Expansion Task force , but by the 
time the groups gOt in cOnla t, the 
pace wa already allocated. 

"Once again, the rehgiou~ orgs 
seemed to have gonen lost In tlle 
huffle," Mersch said. "I am appre-

ciauve of what the currenl referen-
dum IS offering us, but as the very 
wnter of the referendum have told 
me themselves, It IS not an Inter-
faith center."

MONDAY, MAY 12, 200) 

Referendum: Assessing 
student needs is extensive 

continued from page 12 
Finding a patron to finance the 

project has proven to be a less-
than-easy task. Although Saul 
Price donated 10 percent of the 
$20 million that it took to build 
the Price Center, the family was 
somewhat insulted upon being 
approached for additional money 
and declined to contribute to the 
renovations, claiming commit-
ments to other philanthropic 
organizations according to Lynch. 

The state only provides funds 
for the university's educational 
facilities like offices, classrooms 
and laboratortes, but additional 
cost that include residential 
housi ng, lounges, recreational 
centers and campus restaurants 
arc not covered. As a result, stu-
dents arc responsible for bearing 
the financial bur-

vote, but Brown vetoed the reso-
lution, vocalizing an opposition 
argument that the referendum was 
not in the best interest of the stu-
dents . 

Much of the opposition's 
sta nce is based upon the fear that 
student control would be dimin-
ished and student government 
would not retain much of its 
desired control over the new facil-
ity. 

Several pamphlets have been 
distributed by those against the 
expansion referendum to motivate 
students to strongly oppose the 
placement of the referendum on 
the ballot, and the May 2003 issue 
of the Ntw Indicator calls for edu-
cating students about exactly 
where their money is going. 

"If we get students who are 
accountable to the 

den of this co tly 
expansion. 

After evaluating 
students' feedback, 
the taskforce set 
out to wme the 
actual referendum 
that is to be voted 
on this week, 
which plan to 
finance the con-
struction and ren-
ovation with the 
$39 quarterl y fee 
that would be

rest of the studen ts 
making these deci-
sions, the build-
ings we pay for 
will run better. For 
example, students 
wouldn't devote 
huge chunks of the 
Price Center to 

Much of the 
opposition's stance 
is based upon the 
fear that student 
control would be 

the UCSD 
Catering and 
other administra-
tive departments 
that don't have diminished ... 

instituted upon the 
expansion's completion. 

llhough there have been con-
cerns that financial aid will not 
cover the expanded fees, Financial 
Aid Director Vince De Anda is 
confident th3t thi will be funded 
just like any other mandatory uni-
versity fee. 

"While J can't see into the 
future, it would be very unlikely 
that II viable financial aid program 
would not fund anythlllg as baSIC 
and predictable a an increase in 
mandatory fees," De Anda saId . 

ThiS is not the first time that a 
univer ity centers expansion refer-
endum has been propo ed to the 
UC 0 student body. A similar idea 
was composed three years ago, but 
failed, no! because of opposition to 
expal1Sion, but because of a lack of 
votes to meet the 20 percent 
threshold. Of the students who 
voted at that time, 55 percent voted 
in favor of expanding the university 
centers. 

The A.S. Council passed the 
referendum this time by a 14-to-4 

anything to do 
with students -

that space could all be student 
organization office space and 
meeting rooms," said the NroJ 
Indicator. "Think of what we could 
do with all of these spaces if they 
were allocated with students' 
needs in mind!" 

A debate that will present both 
the pro and con views of the expan-
ion referendum will be held on May 

13 at 12:30 p.m. in Price Center 
Pla7..a. tudents who are WlSure how 
to vote on this issue are encouraged 
to attend to learn about all of the 
detaIls and Implications of the refer-
endum of which they may not be 
aware - but nonetheless affect them 
- so they can take the mo ! educat-

seeking increased funding

said orienne Saign, Mc air 
Program coordinator. "We al 0 
have 24 students who have com-
pleted their PhDs and many more 
who are about to finish ." 

aign meets with MCl air ru-
dents tndividually and works clo e-
ly with the tudents, helping them 
to fine-tune their graduate school 
applications. 

"This program was 3 big impact 
for me because I gai ned actual 
research experience, and now I 
know that I want to become a 
research scientist," said Eun Hee 
Han, an Earl Warren College junior. 
"Prior to the program, I did not per-
ceive that as a concrete goal." 

Students who enroll in the 
Health and Medical Professions 
Preparation Program (HMP3) or 
the California Alliance for Minority 
Participation, or who receive the 
Computer Science, Engineering, 
and Mathematics Scholarship, pre-
pare to become bencr candidates 
for admission to highly competitive 
graduate or professional chools 
through contact with UC 0 facul-
ty and professional in the San 
Diego community. 

In the HMP3, students have the 
chance to interact with faculty 
members of the U SO School of

said. "It ail depends on how we/J 
you're doing, and how well you 
want to do. Evetyone is 0 tense, 
you just want [team members] to 
win, and then the deci ion 
comes." 

However, there have been 
cenain drawbacks for the team, 
resulting from the lack of funding 
from the vice chancellor of stu-
dents affairs and the AssOCIated 

tudents. Participation In tourna-
ments is not free, and some come 
with a hefty price tag in order to 
pay )udgmg fees. The ma)onty of 
fees accumulated from the 
Associated Students are u cd to 
pay for the tournaments the team 
attends, and the rest comes from 
their own pockets . 

"We definitely make do with 
the funding we receive. It helps 
us compete," Cantrell said. 
"However, we're competing 
against schools that are well-
funded and also have a paid facul-
ty coach." 

In national tournaments, 
hotel and rranspolT~tion fees are 
to be considered as well, creat-
ing additional COSts for competi-
tion . Cantrell said that for 
National this season, the total 
cost wa about $3 ,000, and the 
As ociated tudents contributed 
$450 for the rrip. This in turn 
required each team member to 
spend $300 in order to attend. 
Cantrell also noted that !inuted 
funding equaI limited number 
of people to take to the tourna-

men . 
For team members, Iugher 

funding benefits the team overall. 
"llhere is a direct correlation 

between fundlllg and success. 
The more tournaments we're 
able to compete .It, the better we 
get. The more experience we get, 
the better we're able to com-
pete," Cantrell said. 

According to team members, 
the reason why fundmg is limited 
is because nearly all of the tour-
naments they attend are held off 
campus and that the AsSOCIated 

tudents gives panngl)' to orga-
nizations that primanly parucI-
pate in events that are not held on 
campus. In order to help pay for 
these tournaments, the team con-
ducts fundraisers and judge for 
high school tournaments in 
Orange County. Members of 
UCSD peech and Debate feel 
that funding is essential to the 
success of their team, as it i a 
competing team that character-
izes UCSD to other colleges. 

"They don't necessariJ y feel 
the need to fund us, even though 
we ue representing UCSD 
nationally in a competinve, acad-
emic activity, which we thinJc is 
definitely a big, representation of 
the school," Cantrell s~id . 

Despite such shortcollungs, 
the team is open to anyone with 
the zeal to debate. 

"There are no tryouts, JUSt 
come with intere t," Cantrell 
said. "If you are dedicated to 
compete, you can."

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Three to leave Triton fencing teams 
UCSD will lose top epee athlete in Davis-Allen 

Iy JON MILES 
Staff Writer 

Three seniors have finished 
their careers as members of the 
UCSD fencing team. Michael 
Davis-Allen and Scott Kim from 
the men 's team and Rebecca 
Dowd from the women's team 
represented the minority as 
seniors on teams that were very 
young this season . 

Davis-Allen played a key role 
on the team as a senior. He was 
the top epee for the Tritons and 
finished third in the 
Intercollegiate Fencing 
Conference of Southern 
California in competition with 
that weapon. He also was the epee 
team captain. 

"Michael was a team leader," 
said UCSD head coach Stuart 
Lee. 
. Lee asked Davis-Allen to be a 

captain for the entire team, but 
Davis-Allen declined because he 
felt that with his studies, he could 
not put in the amount of time 
necessary to be captain. 

SCOrt Kim did not get to play 
as much as a senior as he did as an 
underclassman. Kim started 
before this sea on, but lost his 
starting slot to some talented 

Pulling down their swords 

freshmen, including Jeremy 
Runyan . Kim competed in all 
three weapons, foil. sabre and 
epee. Lee emphasized that Kim 
did not lose his spot because of his 
struggles but because of the out-
standing play of the young players 
on the team. 

Rebecca Dowd started for the 
UCSD women's fencing team and 
had a successful season. She com-
peted as the second foil for the 
women's team and finished 10th 
in the conference in foil. 

"Rebecca W3S definitely a con-
tributor for our team," Lee said. 

Both the men's and women's 
fencing teams were extremely 
young this year after losing many 
seniors from last year's team. Of 
18 starters from that team, only 
five returned this year. Still, the 
coach was excited about the 
young talent from this year's 
team. 

The men's and women's fenc-
ing teams will both miss the con-
tributions and leadership of this 
year's seniors. Despite the loss, 
however, with their young talent, 
both teams have a lot to look for -
ward to next year. 

Triton: Triton is a fitting mascot for UCSD 
contmued fram page :l2 

Gods, lriton is the only one that's 
really tuck around (it helps that 
he's on all the T-shirts, caps, balls 
and such that you find) . 

So now that we've all been 
enlightened as to who Triton is, 
what should we do with this infor-
mation? We always all complain 
birterly about school spirit, but I 
think Triton Pride has potential to 
become as contagious as SARS. 

Raise yoW" hand if you own any-
thing with Triton on it! Something 

that says ucsm That, my friend, is 
school pride. Have you ever enjoyed 
your~f at a school event? Two 
words: Sun God. Spealcing of which, 
our yearly keg-a-thon is fast 
approaching and here are some sug-
gestions on how to prepare: attend a 
sporting event on campus, even if its 
just an excuse to get a tlln; YOW" pres-
ence will help. But here's a good one: 
next time you see a tour group, walk 
by with some of your buddies, yell, 
"Tri-ton

' 
Hurrah!" Cheesy? Urn, 

yeah! But who said school pride had 

to be elegant? 
"Looking at the other nick-

names in the UC system .. . 
UCSD's Triton may be the most 
representative of the campus from 
which it emanates," said Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse. 

Which brings me to my final 
point: clearly, we should take pride 
in who and what we are here at 
UCSD. ByaU laws of deduction, WI! 
- at UCSD - are gods and god-
desses. And that's reason enough to 
StaTt the Sun God celebf1ltions early.

COMMENTARY 

Why are we the Tritons? 
A quick look behind the UCSD mascot 

By MAlIA EVANS 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD is suffering trom an 
identity crisis. If you aren't sure 
exactly how, here's a test for 
you: turn to your inner self and 
ask., "Self, what are we here at 
UCSO?" And your inner self will 
answer, "We're the forks," or better 
yet, "We're male mennaids." Both 
of these answers have reverberated 
through the minds of many per-
plexed UCSD students, but it's 
time to put an end to this echo. 

Let's begin with some Greek 
Mythology 101. Poseidon, broth-
er of the all-powerful Zeus, was 
ruler of the oceans, among other 
things. Like all Greek gods, he 
had many lady friends, one of 
whom was Amphitrite, a lesser-
known sea nymph. To make a long 
story short, Amphitrite gave birth 
to one of Poseidon's sons: Triton. 
While it's true that Triton was a 
memnn, he did share Poseidon's 
powerful control of the ocean. H e 
did so with a conch shell, which he 
blew mightily when the waves 

needed to be whipped 
into shape. 

Obviously, 
there is a connec-
ti on between the 
mighty Triton men-
tioned above and the 
merman who we see on 
so many logos around 
campus. But thjs is where the 
UC D identity becomes even 
more bafflmg. Triton on the 
UCSD logos IS holding a rather 
large, three-pronged pitchfork. 

What happened to the conch? 
Pay attention people! That 

fork is called a trident; It's 
Poseidon~ weapon of mass 
chaos, and apparently Triton 

liked to borrow it every now and 
then. 

Admittedly, it is confusing that 
UCSD's mascot, Triton, carries a 
trident when it's just been 
explained that he shouldn't. But 
let's try and act like the well-edu-
cated people we are, and handle 
m;s with reason. Our mascot is 
Triton, therefore we, at UCSD, 

are the TritOns. It seems fair to 
me, then, that our symbol is the 
trident. It would have been 
more convenient to have had 

Triton pictured with a conch 
shell, but honestly, there's noth-

ing too intimidating about a 
sea hell . I won't even begin to dis-
cuss the perils of a potential foot-
ball team with a seashell logo on 

their helmets. Enough said. 
According to UCSD 

Athletic D irector Earl W. 
Edwards, "The Triton was 

picked because of its a 50-
ciation with the ocean, 
which was the founda-

tion for UCSD. The 

co n -
sid e re d 
one of the 
better 
mascots due 
to its uniqueness 
as well as its 
design." 

Triton is

Well there you go, U SO: Our 
school and our traditions were

Softball's captain, 
catcher will be missed 
Lone senior Hunstad started all 
but two games in her four years 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD softball team will 
only be losing one senior to grad-
uation this year, but her absence 
will be felt; the team, which fin-
ished 13-19 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and 24-32 overall, will mjss 
Kristin Hunstad's talent and lead-
ership. 

"Kristin has been our starting 
catcher for four years and has start-
ed all but 10 games or so; she has 
worked with all k;nds of pitchers; 
she is incredibly knowledgeable, 
and she calls a great game berund 
the plate," said UCSD head coach 
Patti Gerclcens. 

For her part, Hunstad willlOiss 
the rest of the Triton team, espe-
cially the memories and friend -
ships she has accrued over the 
four years. 

"One of my best memories will 
be going to regionals two years," 
Hunsud said. "Also, the team 
morale this year and playing with 
such a great group of girls." 

Hunstad finished the 2003 sea-
son with a .243 batting average 
while sco ring 14 runs and knock-
ing in 14 more. She had a .333 on 
base percentage and ended up 
with fewer strikeouts ( \6) than 
walks (18). Hunstad had a .279 
slugging percentage and hit three 
doubles and a triple over the 
course of the sea on. Her 38 total 
base were fourth highest on the 
team and her .980 fielding per-
cen tage belund the plate wa the 
second rughest on the te3m , com-
mitting only five error in 52 

games. 
"Kristin just had great skills," 

Gerckens said . "She had a great 
arm, almost no one stole on her, 
and hardly anyone even attempted 

Kristin HunsYd 
Softball 

Courtesy of UCSD 
Athletics 

to steal on her; 
other teams 
respected her." 

In her final 
seaso n , 
Hunstad served 
the tri pie role 
of tcam captain, 
her second year 
in this position; 
starting catch -
er; and mentor 
for freshman 
Jennifer 

Leonard, who will most likely be 
the Tritons ' starting catcher next 
year. 

"Losing your starting catcher is 
hard, and we're really going to mis 
her leadership," Gercken~ aid . 
"She had good balance; she was 
both a good winner and a good 
loser." 

Hunstad poke incredibly hjgh-
Iy of her four years of experience 
while playing on the UCSD sofl-
ball team. 

"It has been a pleasure working 
with thi coaching staff and learn-
ing all four of my years, knowing 
that the coaches want it as much as 
you," Hunstad said. 

Gerckens heaped praise on 
Hunstand, and it wa~ clear the 
team liked and respected her as 
well, but all these feelings can he 
best summed up In one )Imple sen-
tence by Gercken). 

"The team played for her this 
year," she said.

nerup In [he shot put then won 
the shot put on May 9 With a 
school record toss of 50'4". The 
mark easily ecli psed the prevIOus 
record she al ready held . 

"The competition was finished 
after that - no one came within 
SIX feet of her mark - It was one 
of the most dominant perfor-
mances I have seen," Salerno said. 

The only other Triton event 
winner was freshman Kendra 
Canape, who won the }ugh Jump

while Meredith Perry captured

Lmdsay Stalker took seventh in 
the 800, timing In at 2:21.64. 

"Sung was a real force, but she 
was a bttle off due to Ickne s," 

alerno said . 
Illness sapped the trength of

espeCially on the men 's Side, but 
many star shone despite the rainY

Other sprint events had good 
performances, such as the sixth-

UCSD's Trevor Talcayama and 
C.j . Lawrence, who raced in at 
11.09 and 11.1 0, respectively, in

the Mavericks was Chris Webber. 
With him out, Sacramento simply 
can't outscore the Mavs enough 
times to win the series. Peja is the 
only big-time scoring threat left, 
and he's not dom;nant enough to 
carry a tcam. The Kings have little-
to-no low post presence with 
Floppy Divac and overrated Keon 
Clark as their best options. 

Maybe San Antonio can beat 
the Mavs. Maybe whoever comes 
out of the East will put up a fight. 
But maybe ick "I've never met a 
shot I didn't like" Van Exel, Steve 
"My hair goes one way, I go the 
other" Nash, Dirk "I can shoot 
over anybody" Nowitzki and 
Michael "Don't forget about me" 
Finley can pull it off. 

I might be wrong, but like my 
team, being defensive isn't my 
style. Don't despair though, Kings 
and Lakers fans . An NBA champi-
onship ring will probably find its 
way to California this year. As long

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

I 'm as excited as anybody to see a Lakers-King rematch of last year's classic showdown. It's 
roo bad the NBA doesn't have a 
fifth-place game. 

This campus seems to be polar-
Ized into twO different sects. The 
one from the nonh that bleeds 
black and purple, thinks V1ade' 
flop are genuine and believes that 
the Kings have a hell a good chance 
of wInning It all this year. The 
other tribe is from the south. A 
band of loyalists and bandwagoners 
alike who live and die by Kobe 's 
jumper, think the Lakers deserve all 
the calls they get and don't find it 
odd thatJack icholson wears sun-
glasses indoors. And then there's 
me. 

I grew up in the Bay Area, in a 
CIty named Santa Clara, where a 
respectable Jesuit university sits 
about 10 blocks from my house. 

Growing up a Warnors fan In 
the day of Chris Mullin and Tim 
Hardaway, I gained an apprecia-
tion for the BA, though it was 
never my first love. A few yea rs of 
following the Warriors is enough 
for anyone though. Bad draft 
picks, poor leadership and a string 
of bad apples including Latrell 
Sprewell, Joe Smith and ChrIS 
Webber left me sympathetIc to 
the cau e, but in search of a new 
team. 

At about that time, a young 
Canadian point guard who I 'd 
watched at Santa Clara University 
was traded from the Phoenix Suns 
to the Dallas Mavericks. The 
Mavericks also changed owner-
lup - gOIng into the hands of a 

renegade billionaire who runs hIS 
bUSInesses like they are games he 
plans to win. Around the same 
Ume, a seven-foOl tall German 
who prefers the perImeter to the 
post landed in Dallas as well. 
With the convergence of Steve 

ash , Mark Cuban and Dirk 
OWl tzki , a revolutionary brand 

of basketball was born, and 1 
found my team. 

ow that they're winning, I 
realize you're going to doubt my 
genuinene s, but I love the Mavs 
for the way they play, win or lose. 

It' a mindset that defense IS 
merely the way to start the fast 
break, and that every shot is make-
able. It's basketball In the 120s 
every night, a pace that never low 
down, and thIS year, it' the best 
brand of basketball out there. 

orry, Kings fans. I apologize, 
Lakers fans. The road to the finals 
goes through Texas this season. 

The Lakers are fatally flawed . 
There's no Zen magIc there, jU$t 
two superstars and a couple of rol e 
players. WIth injuries to RIck Fox 
and Devean George, the cast of 
role players has shrunk to a dan-
gerous level. There's no magIc 
left. The Lakers are a ured bunch 
that was pushed to the IInlIt by a 
medIoc re MInnesota team, and 
anybody that lets Bruce Bowen 
lIght them up IS no champIonshIp 
contender.
