UCSD Professor Stabbed To Death 
• Charles Thomas, the 'Father of Black Psychology' dead at 64 
By Jason Snell 
News Editor 

UCSD Professor Charles William Tho-
mas n, considered by some as the 'Father of 
Black Psychology,' was fatally stabbed in 
San Diego late Friday night. 

suffering from multiple stab wounds to his 
chest and side, but he was pronounced dead at 
1 :48 a.m. Saturday moming. 

According to police, an investigation is 
continuing, but few details about the stabbing 
were available at press time. 

lbomas joined the UCSD faculty as a full 
professor in 1971 as part of the Urban and 
Rural Studies program at the newly-founded 
Third College, according to UCSD Public 
Information Director Winifred Cox. Until his 
death he was still part of that program, now 
known as Urban Studies and Planning. 

According to Cox, he was an expert on 
urban culture and Afro-American culture 
and psychology. 

"I'm deeply saddened by his death - It 
is a great loss for UCSD," Vice Chancellor 
for Undergraduate Affairs Joseph Watson 
said. Watson was provost of Third College 
when Thomas arrived at UCSD.

According to police, Thomas, 64, was 
found slumped over the steering wheel of his 
car by a group of people using a nearby 
automated teller machine who had heard him 
call for help. They called police at 11 : 14 p.m., 
and lbomas was taken from the site in the 
4100 block of El Cajon Blvd. to Villa View 
Community Hospital. 

Surgeons at the hospital performed 
emergency surgery on lbomas, who was

"He was an individual of distinctive 
talents and ideas, and it won't be possible to 
replace him," Watson said. "A large num-
ber of students looked to him as not just an 
instructor, but as a personal advisor. Long

Over 650 Students Join New Credit Union 
By Kent Korzon 
Senior Staff Writer 

After several years of delays, the 
Associated Students-sponsored 
UeSDStudentCreditUnion(SCU) 
opened on Sept. 4. Since its opening, 
over 659 members have joined and 
16 loans have been granted. 

SCU Branch Manager Dee Rice 
says that business has exceeded 
original expectations, which, she 
said "had projected 500 new ac-
counts in a year." 

"The students are excited to have 
their own financial institution right 
on campus where it can be t erve 
their unique financial needs," Rice 
said. 

A.S. Pre ident John Ed on ex-
plained that he ee the CU a an 

"exciting example of student induc-
tion on this campus. 

"While most people have little 
idea what the A.S. does, here is an 
[example] of some of the services 
we have created for students," he 
said. 

The SCU is non-profit and open 
to all UeSD students and recent 
alumni. Graduate students may join 
the University & State Employee 
Credit Union (U.S.E.). 

The SCU is a subsidiary of 
U.S.E., as well as a service of the 
A sociated Students. It provides a 
full line of banking ervice ', in-
cluding checking and avings ac-
counts, VlSA card , A TM service, 
new and u ed auto loan , personal 
loans up to $5,000, and a free tele-

phone information and transaction 
system. 

'The SCU interest rate on VlSA 
accounts is 15.9%. However, stu-
dent loans are not offered at this 
time. 

"There won't be any in the near 
future," Rice said 

When asked ifit will be easier for 
UeSD students to get credit at the 
SCU than elsewhere, Rice aid, 
"We're cautious ... [the borrower] 
has to be able to repay." 

Rice also pointed out that "a 
tudent's parents may co- ign [the 

loan ]."

and promoted four and a half years 
ago by Doug Hut hing, a UCSD

Delays Caused by New 
UCSD Power Project 
• 69kV upgrade will cost $6.1 million 
By Jennifer Meadows 
Staff Writer 

In order to meet the increasing 
power demands caused by rapid uni-
versity growth, UCSD and San Di-
ego Gas & Electric will begin con-
struction of a massive power ex-
pansion project which is expected to 
bring traffic delays on some campus 
roads from early October until late 
January. 

Until now, the campus has been 
served by three separate off -campus 
substations that, it is estimated, will 
be sufficient to meet UCSD's power 
needs for only two more years. 

According to Ed Mazur, an archi-
tect on the UCSD Design Review 
Board, "It's adequate now, but it's 
reaching its peak capacity." 

He cited the campus' projected 
speedy growth as the catalyst for the 
endeavor. 

"Many of the new buildings we'll 
be bringing on-line are very sophis-
ticated buildings, requiring a lot of 
research equipment and so forth and 
they have a high energy demand, so 
we just don't have enough [power] 
right now to handle it," Mazur said. 

To change that, the university 
and SDG&E have agreed on a joint 
project where each of the two will 
have separate and distinct construc-
tion responsibilities. 

The total construction bill for 
UCSD is calculated at about 6.1 
million dollars. 

SDG&E will be building a 69 
kilovolt (k V) power substation within 
a university-constructed enclo ure 
at Genesee Avenue on the north side 
of campus. 

The ubstation will contain me-
tering and protection eq ui pment, and 
the transformer that will convert the 
69kV power to the 12kV level that 
can be di tributed throughout the 
campu. 

In addition to building and land-
caping the enclo ure, the uni-

versity's tasks will include the 
construction of a switching station 
to control distribution, and the un-
derground installation of the actual 
cables needed to carry power to the 
different areas of campus. 

Mazur pointed out that it is the 
digging up of roads to bury these 
cables that will cause disruptions in 
traffic flow. 

"From the 69kV substation, to 
and throughout the entire UCSD 
campus, all the networking will be 
underground and that's why we're 
talking about the various inconve-
niences to the public due to traffic 
control on the roads," Mazur ex-
plained. 

Mazur added that there would 
always be at least one flag-person at 
the work sites tv control traffic, but 
assured that " the roads will be pass-
able." 

He also confirmed reports that 
delays are not expected to exceed 
five minutes at any site. 

According to Paul Alatorre, the 
project manager, planners negoti-
ated diligently with SDG&E for al-
most an entire day to reach the most 
cost-effective decision for the uni-
versity. 

Alatorre, who participated in the 
negotiations, said that alternatives 
included a plan that would use an 
existing station and build two more, 
one at a northern and one at an 
eastern location on campu . Nego-
tiators con idered another plan that 
called for one 69k V substation to be 
built at the east side of the campus, 
we t of Interstate 5. 

Alatorre li ted as a benefit of the 
adopted plan the fact that mainte-
nance would be facilitated by good 
communication between the two 
partie involved, meaning that there 
is a definite and recognizable point 
where UCSD' and SDG&E' 
maiutenance re pon ibilities part

General Store Joins Bookstore, 
Groundworks in Selling Textbooks Want to write for The Guardian? 
• Hyperlearning decides not to get into the business alone 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

The General Store Co-op, lo-
cated in the Student Center, began 
selling textbooks for the firs t time 
this quarter in conjunction with Hy-
perleaming, a professional tutori ng 
service. 

JeffCorben, the geneml manager 
of Ihe General Siore, said that the 
store's goal is to sell the books for as 
Iowa price as possible, staying at 
least 10 percent below the Univer-
sity Bookstore' s prices. 

"SelJing books is something 
we've wantedtodo foralongtime," 
Corben said He cited the small size 
of the store's previous location in 
another part of the Student Center as 
the reason books were not sold 
earlier. The store moved to its cur-
rent location early last year. 

The co-op currently offers a 
limited selection of texts. Corben 
said that the store targeted large first 
quarter freshman classes and or-
dered conservatively. 

A few professors ordered through 
the General Store, according to 
Corben. The co-op also sells used 
books that were bought back from 
students at the end of Spring Quar-
ter last year. 

Corbett said he was swprised 
that the experiment was so suc-
cessful after having stayed awake 
some nights worrying that the books . 

would not sell. 
"Now that we know people will 

come, we will expand," he added. 
Hyperleaming, which had also 

planned to begin selling books to 
students, sold its stock to the co-op 
after it was discovered thai the co-
op would be selling books. 

"We didn't want to be in com-
petition with [the co-op]," said John 
Smart, a partner of Hyperleaming. 
"We have the same general philoso-
phy as the co-op." 

Hyperleaming actually helped 
the General Store out by selling the 
store its stock, according to Corbett. 
He explained that because he was 
not sure how many books would 
sell, the store ordered 175 books for 
a class that had I, I 00 students en-
roUed. The texts quickly sold out, 
but the books from Hyperleaming 
supplemented the stock, Corbett 
said. 

Smart said that Hyperleaming 
had decided to start selling books to 
prov ide a service to help the students. 
Many of the books that 
Hyper-leaming planned to sell were 
texts for the classes they offered 
tutoring for, mainly science and math 
courses. 

"We had noticed that no used 
books had appeared in these cat-
egories," Smart said. 

TIle General Store also plans to 
buy back student texts again at the 

end of the quarter. 
Corbett explained that the texts 

that can be resold in the futu re will 
be bought back for 10 percent more 
than the bookstore will pay. Other 
texts will be bought back by used 
book companies, which pay signifi-
cantly less. 

Paul Mares, director of the Uni-
versity Bookstore in the Price Center, 
seemed unconcerned about the new 
competition. 

"Part of our job is to deal with 
whatever competition we have," 
Mares said. "We have never been 
without competition." 

"Our job is to have texts for all 
Ihe students," Mares said . 

"It's a tricky business to buy and 
sell books. It's very easy to end up 
with a lot of books and lose a lot of 
money very quickly," Mares con-
tinued. 

The texts in the University 
Bookstore are priced according to 
the profit margin, the markup on a 
given item above the wholesale 
price. Bookstore texts have a profit 
margin of about 25 percent, while 
other items sold at the bookstore 
llave margins of 40-50 percent, ac-
cording to Mares. 

He said all of the overhead for 
the books, such as freight, rent, 
employee salaries, and other costs, 
is paid for with the money made on 
the profit margin.

ERRATA 
The Guardian article "A.S. Questions RIMAC's Validity" con-

tained a mistake and several statements requiring clarification. 
The article stated that the A.S. council passed a resolution authored 

by Vice-President External Molly McKay which expressed concem 
over several discrepancies regarding the administration 's role in 
RlMAC by a vote of 8-2. The vote was in fact 18-2. The Guardian 
regrets tltis error. 

In addition, the article stated that the subject of the A.S. special 
meeting last Monday was the RIMAC referendum. In fact, the entire 
RlMAC facility was the subject of the meeting, and the referendum 
was only one topic discussed. 

The article a1so stated that grievances about tileRlMAC referendum 
had been completed. According to McKay, the grievances are still 
pending. 

The article misquoted McKay and John Edson as saying that 
members of the faculty were manipulating students and that faculty 
members were pressuring the A.S. In those statements, Edson and 
McKay was not actually referring to facu lty members, but to mem-
bers of the UCSD administration. 

The Guardian apologizes if any misunderstandings were created 
due to the unclear and incorrect statements in this article.

RIMAe 

Some Reasonable Doubt 
RlMAC, it seem ,is nOl a done deal after all. Qu lions about the 

Validity of the election last February, in which -rudents voted to 
approve the multi-million dollar recreational facility and the $70 fee 
increase that accompanies it, are now being debated in the AS. 

Everyone agrees that we need the facility-desperately. RlMAC 
will meet the recreational needs of a growing university population 
well into the 21st century. Unfortunately. the means to that end are 
looking more and more questionable. 

Themain ubjectofdebate is the election itself. There is a distinct 
pos ibility that the election was bogus-a carefully constructed ruse 
to attract a bare majority, mostly of those who would benefit rno t 
from the facility - athletes. 

If anything, the election was conducted in a highly irregular 
fashion. For instance, it was held as a "Special Election," completely 
separate from the general AS. elections in the spring. 

Election orgaruzers took the unorthodox and unprecedented step 
of not requiring a two-thirds majority vote in order for the referendum 
to pass. Usually, when a fee increase i~ at i ue, a two-thirds vote is 
tandard. A1w, at least 20 percent of the student populanon - both 

graduate and undergraduate - had to vOle in order to make the 
elections valid. Twenty percent IS only about 3000 students. The 
election passed with 51.3 percent (or I ,811 student's) approval, with 
a voter turnout of 21.4 percent (about 3,531 Students). 

Theelections were not conducted by theAS .. and were not bound 
by AS. election bylaws. Rather, the referendum was conducted 
using UC system-wide Student Fee Funded Facilities and Student 
Fee Referenda guidelrnes. 

Without the resoictions of AS. bylaws, the RlMAC referendum 
organizers were freed from a number of inconveniences, including 
campaign spending limits. Opponents of the election allege that 
organizer,; spent in excess of $2600 on campaign materials. AS. 
bylaws place a limit of $250 on campaign materials. 

Furthermore, the so-caIJed informational brochure was far from 
objective, and anything but neutral. Yet the brochure was the only 
piece of information available to students asked to decide whether 
they wanted to levy an additional $70 a quarter upon themselves. 
Also, there was little opponunity for public debate, and no opposition 
campaign literature. 

The biggest strike against RIMAC is its heer expense. $70 per 
student, per quarter is a lot of money. There is still the realistic hope 
of acquiring corporate sponsorships t(}help deffer the massive costs 
of RIMAe. 

The election controversy most recently came to a head at the last 
AS. meeting, when V.P. External Molly McKay proposed a res0-
lution stating that the university administration overstepped its 
boundaries by influencing the RIMAC Planning Committee and 
"made conscious efforts to limit public debateconceming RIMAC." 
According to McKay, RIMAC would be under the control of the 
administration, rather than students, despite the fact that students are 
footing most of the bill. 

McKay's resolution calls for-amongotherthings-a"prompt, 
fair, an<! irnpanial hearing," to address all outstanding grievances 
concerning elections irregularities, and for full and unconditional 
student control of all aspects of RIMAC operations. 

Although the AS. council passed the resolution, President John 
Edson vetoed it The resolution would have been a step in the right 
direction. If anything, the McKay resolution is a protest of principle. 
Students want RlMAC. Students need RIMAe. But students do not 
like being railroaded inlo a biased and unfair election. 

The administration was afraid that if the RIMAC referendum did 
not pass, it would face the W1popular decision of overriding the vote 
and going ahead with RIMAC anyway. After all, RlMAC presents 
a number oflucrative opportunities for the future, including helping 
to solve any logistical problems with space that may arise if an<! when 
the athletic depamnent decides to go Division n, or 1 

This issue needs to be swept clean of all doubt The RIMAC 
referendwn must be revised and brought to a vote yet again. This 
time, however, the elections committee must set up clear campaign 
regUlations, allow sufficient opportunity for debate, and provide an 
independent hearing body for any grievances. But, should RIMAC 
actually come to a vote, we would once again strongly urge all 
students to VOle yes.

Life Lessons in the Surf 
• The Thrill of Trying New Things, Like Surfing, 
Can Hold the Key ·to True Understanding 
By Robin Mac Lean, Managing Editor 

[ have always lived within five minutes of the 
beach and have spent countless hours sitting in the 
sun, walking along the edge of the water, swim· 
ming, playing Smashball, and I've even done 
beach clean up projects. Lately I've found a new 
fascination at tbe beacb - the surf. 

I have this 
overwhelming 
desire to be 
able to surf, to 
ride a wave 
along the shore 
and feel the 
power of the 
ocean. I'm not 
even sure it's 
learning how to 
surf that's 
gonenme so 

perplexed. Instead,lthink: it's the challenge of 
doing something new, learning a new skill, feeling 
in control of something that I'm not sure about-
something of which I am in awe. 

All my life I have been interested in new things 
and events, so it's not surprising that I've become 
hooked on surfmg. I like trying something new 
and finding out that 1 can succeed. 

However, I hate it when someone tells me wbat 
to do. I'll even go out of my way not to do 
whatever it was, no matter bow much I wanted to 
do it in the first place. Nobody told me to go learn 
how to surf. It was just out there waiting for me to 
try - waiting for me to fail- and I was ready to 
conquer. 

When I walked to the water's edge and 
watched the surf pound into shore, I stopped and 
asked myself: Why? Why am I here? What do J 
have to prove? 

It's amazing how many times I've asked myself 
these questions - when I applied for a job which 
I knew I wasn '[ going to get, when I tried out for 
cheerleading in the ninth grade, when I came to 
UCSD where I did not know anyone imtead of 
playing it safe and going to Ua.A where a bunch 
of my friends were. 

I stood at the surf line zipping up my wetsuit 
thinking that I just had to go for it - just get my 
head wet and stan paddling. All the other surfers 
who were out knew what they were doing or at 
least I thought they did. I did not think about the 
fact that they might be in the same position as I 
was and still learning. Even if they were not, they 

might be nice enough to help me out - or at 
least stay out of my way. I felt the same way my 
freshman year when I moved into an apartment 
with three people I didn't know, but who all 
knew each other. 

Once I was out there with my $15, swap meet 
special, seven foot board I realized that this was 
not going to be as easy as some of the things I'd 
mastered in my life. The waves seemed a lot 
bigger close up than they did from the parking 
lot. 

UCSD seemed a lot bigger when I first 
arrived, and quite a few of the buildings that are 
here now didn't exist then. I had trouble finding 
my classes, I used to wonder about the people 
who seemed to know everyone as they walked 
down the main pathway, and felt intimidated by 
professors and TAs. 

I picked a wave that wasn't too big and 
decided I'd give it a ny. I paddled and paddled 
and caught the wave and my nose promptly 
buried in the water and the board flipped over, 
my mouth filled with salt water as did my nose, 
my ears, my wetsuit, etc. 

I felt the board give me a tl!g where I was 
connected to the leash - at least that helped me 
figure out which way was up. This is more than I 
can say about some of my first year classes. I 
was so buried in Chemistry and periodic tables 
and reactions and enthalpies and entropys that I 
did not know which way was up or out. I sneezed 
a few times. took a few big breaths of air and 
p;lddled back out I figured that if I gave up now 
I'd never go back out. Likewise, I jumped right 
into another chemistry class, and kept walking 
down the main path. 

It took a while - and a few friends laughing 
at me - until I stood up. It was brief time on my 
feet I'll admit, but at least there was a glimmer of 
hope. 

I'd figtnd out where I needed to stand on the 
board 10 keep it from plummeting straight to the 
bottom IDd keep myself from falling off before I 
even stood up. It took some guts and even some 
risks, but I began 10 get the bang of it. I could 
stand. not vel)' steadily, but I could stand and 
ride the wave. There was no turning involved but 
it was a start and I was never going to learn if I 
wasn't out there practicing. 

I felt quite a bit more comfortable once I had 
been at UCSD for a while. I began to know 
where I was going, I met people in my classes

Public Is Fed-Up with Dirty Politics 
NEW YORK - Well, it's offi-

cial. The theme of the 1990 fall 
elections has been certi fied by The 
Committee, validated by The Tri-
bunal, and disseminated among The 
People. And the winner is... The 
Public Is Fed-Up. 

It all came to a head this week. 
On Tuesday, the Times-Mirror Co. 
released a huge survey of thousands 
of voters, demonstrating that most 
of us regard the Democrats as inca-
pable of keeping the pro perity, 
while looking at Republicans as the 
party of greed. The poll also showed 
big jumps in the number believing 
that those in power don' t care about 
ordinary Americans and are out of 
touch. 

That same day, voters in everal 
states exacted heavy tribute from 
political insiders: In Massachusetts, 
both parties chose "outsider" candi-
dates for governor. Democrats not 
only nominated an acerbic maver-
ick, Boston University President 
John Silber. but brushed aside the 
incumbent anomey general and the 
once-powerful house speaker, who 
was seeking statewide office. 

In Oklahoma, voters over-
whelmingly approved a 12-year 
limit for state legislators; other states, 
including California, are likely to 
adopt similar restrictions in No-
vember. 

By week's end, front-page sto-
ries in our biggest newspapers were 
trumpeting the "fed-up" theme, and 
by the time the leaves begin to tum, 
that story will have filled the 
news magazines and weekend talk 
shows. 

Now there is ample reason for 
the electorate to be fed-up about a 
lot of things, both locally and na-

tionally. For instance, District of 
Columbia Democrats picked out-
sider Sharon Pratt Dixon as their 
mayoral candidate. Is it surprising 
that a city whose mayor stands re-
vealed as a chron ic crack user should 
feel a sense of betrayal? In Massa-
chusetts, the reputation of outgoing 
Governor Michael Dukakis has 
fallen faster than that state 's bond 
ratings. 

Nationally, the specter of a gov-
ernment unable to deal with $200 
billion-a-year budget deficits, con-
fronting the half-triUion-dollar cost 
of the savings and loan debacle (the 
comptroller general now says the 
final cost might be much higher), is 
fully capable of eaming the distrust 
and contempt of the voters. 

But before this official theme 
drowns out every other idea about 
the current state of our politics, 
consider: When we move away from 
local races, a far murkier picture \ 
emerges. 

For instance, of the 33 senators 
and 4QO..plus repre entatives seek-
ing renomination thiS season, only 
one was turned aside by his party. 
And that congressman, Ohio's 
Donald Lukens, had admitted to 
having sex with a teen-age girl. All 
the others - including those with 
ties to the beleaguered S&L indus-

try - mlUlaged to win their party's 
nomination again. 

Moreover, the idea of a fed-up 
public rising against those in power 
confronts a clas ic political di-
lemma: Just who is in charge? 

In past years, the target for voter 
disaffection was easier to define: In 
1932, a depression-weary America 
threw out President Hoover and a 
bushelfull of congressional Repub-
licans. In 1946, war-weary voters 
tumed the Congress over to the Re-
publicans. In 1974, Watergate-
weary voters pummeled every Re-
publican they could find. In 1980, 
i nfl at ion-and-hostage- wea ry 
Americans gave the WhiteHouse to 
Reagan and the Senate to the GOP. 

This time, the picture is decid-
edly muddled. If, for instance, vot-
ers are furious over the S&L mess, 
do they blame the Republicans, who 
have run the White House for 10 
years and who went hog-wild for 
reckless deregulation, or congres-
sional Democrats, many of whom 
took big bucks from the S&L insiders 
and pressured regulators to-look the 
other way? 

Do they blame George Bu h for 
an impossibly optimistic view of 
growth, or the Congress for failing 
to rein in spending? 

Do they vent their anger at the 
Congress in general or at their own 
representatives, whom they have 
been returning to office with 98 
percent certainty? 

Maybe this time the anger will 
grow; maybe this time a tidal wave 
will engulf the "ins" by November. 
My own view is that, while it makes 
a great story, the "throw-the-ra..,-
cals-out" sentiment is more a possi-
bility than a probability.

people. Ijoined a club or two, went to sports events, hung out at 
Canyonview and sat on the Gym steps. 

Gradually I began to feel like I belonged here. Now J hardly 
ever leave San Diego. I still have my friends at home, we still 
call and write, and sometimes we'll make a group road trip or at 
least get together on vacations, but now J have my San Diego 
world that they real1y aren ' t a part of. 

I must have done something right; I still live with one of the 
people I moved in with three years ago. I have a lot of good 
friends as well as surfing buddies. I know where most every-
thing on campus is although some of the new building names 
have caused some problems. I know most of my professors and 
TAs these days and I'm not as nervous about talking in front of 
a class (although it is still not my favorite thing to do). I've 
passed five chemistry classes (though I still have one more to 
take), and when I walk down the main path I almost always see 
at least one person I know (if not a few more), in which case 
I'm often late for class. 

I've been surfing for about four months now. I'm still not 
great, in fact I wouldn't even say good. I still get pounded a lot 
but I think I stand up on at least as may waves as I don't. 
Nobody told me to go learn how to surf. It is one of those 
challenges that I gave myself. If I stick with it long enough I'm 
bound to succeed, to gain that critical edge before I move on to 
something new. In the meantime I'm going to go buy a new 
longboard.

Construction 
Worker Found 
With Stolen 
Equipment 
By Kent Korzon 
Senior Staff Writer 

An unu ual pair of coincidences 
helped UCSD Police detectives to 
recover a stolen are-welder, and to 
arrest Curtis Frace, 22, as a suspect 
in the case. 

On Thursday, Frace, a labor at 
the Mandell Weiss Forum Theater 
construction site, pleaded guilty to 
burglary in San Diego Superior 
Court, according to UCSD Police 
Detective Sgt. Bob Jones. 

The $3,000 arc-welder, on a 
trailer, was stolen from the Central 
Utility Building on -Sept. 10. 

According to Jone , a subcon-
tractor who worked at the building 
and was familiar with the custom-
ized arc-welder happened to pull up 
behind a pickup truck towing it at 
the intersection of Villa La Jolla 
Drive and La Jolla Village Drive. 
He was only able to seethe first digit 
of the license plate, a three, as well 
as provideadescriptionofthe truck. 

The subcontrac tor's information 
led UCSD Police detectives to the 
Mandell Weiss Forum Theatercon-
struction site acro s the street from 
the Central Utility Building on 
Tuesday, Sept. II , Jones said. 

Police found a truck matching 
the description of the suspected ve-
hicle after checking the con truc-
tion site, Jones said, who described 
the truck as having dents on the 
license plate and fresh scratches on 
the rear bumper consistent with re-
cent towing . 

The truck was impounded as 
evidence, and on Sept. 12, police 
interviewed several people in 
Poway, where theownerofthe truck 
lived. Based on these interviews, 
Frace was arrested that day on a 
charge of burglary. The officers 
"made the arrest [of Frace] without 
[the stolen] property," Jones said. 

According to Jones, UCSD Po-
lice received a call on Sept. 20 from 
the wife of a UCSD professor who 
owns rental property in Poway. 
During the course of a property in-
spection, the professor had noticed 
an arc-welder with UCSD identifi-
cation on it and reported the find to 
the police.

him." 

Psychology Professor Philip 
Raphael remembered Thomas as an 
important figure on both academic 
and personal level . 

"He was a key person in getting 
African-American students in-
volved in psychology," Raphael 
said. "His book [BoysNoMore] gave 
a number of students an opportunity 
to get published in the field." 

Like Watson, Raphael Singled 
out Thomas' efforts in working with 
students, and spoke of the personal 
loss that comes with Thomas' death. 

"He has alway been a forerun-
ner in developing and encouraging 
students . ... He will be sorely missed, 
but his influence will continue to be 
felt in the years to come, not only 
through his own work. but also 
through the students he has 
influenced and inspired," Raphael 
said.

The opening of the fac ility, 
Originally scheduled for Fall Quar-
ter 1989, was postponed because 
the process took longer than antici-
pated, according to U.S.E. Credit 
Union President Jim Kieweg. 

The steps included facility plan-

Hunt spoke hi ghly of 
Chadwell, " Diana is special in a

herself all the time. Anyone in 
the community knows that [if she 
is needed] she will come out and 
do a lecture or anything to 
promote fitness." 

Schlicht mentioned how 
remarkable Chadwell 's qualities 
are as a teacher as well, "She's a 
very fun, animated teacher. 
Versus reading out of a book, she 
gives lots of hands on demon-
strations by bringing in labels to 
Tead or plastic models of food to 
talk about." 

Chadwell was recommended 
by 1 00 percent of her students 
last year according to the Course 
And Professor Evaluation 
(CAPE) publication. 

Her dedication to teaching is 
hardly affected by her cancer, as 
Schlicht said, "She's still very 
upbeat and positive. After her 
last treatment, she went right 
back to teaching, even though 
she had to wear a wig. She 
wanted to be there for her 
students and taught until the end 
of school. Then she went to 
Texas." 

Texas is where Chadwell is 
currently undergoing treatment. 
Schlicht explained the procedure 
specifically called Bone Marrow 
Development Therapy, "They 
harvest 25 percent of the bone 
marrow and use chemotherapy to 
kill cancer cells which also kills 
remaining bone marrow. They 
install the bone marrow, and if it

she has an 80 percent chance of

Series of Seminars Discuss Current U.S.-Mexican Relations 
By Traci Powell 
Staff Writer 

Several nations have altered 
their political structure, and among 
these countries is our neighbor to 
the south. 

With Mexico 's political 
changes comes a variety of ques-
tions. Janice Cramer, a Hispanic 
student, wishes "infonnation was 
more readily obtainable since 
Mexico is one of our neighbors." 

This quarter, infonnation on 
the current changes in the politi-
cal structure of Mexico and how 
these changes are affecting U.S. -

Mexican relations will be ad-
dressed in a series of seminars of-
fered by the Center for U.S.-Mexi-
can Studies. The next session will 
be held this Wednesday. 

A total of 15 ociologists, po-
litical scientists, and other exp<.rts 
from UCSD and around the world 
will present new research in U.S.-
Mexican interaction and public 
policy perspectives affecting U .S.-
Mexico relations every year. Also 
covered in these seminars are top-
ics dealing wi th with Mexico's 
general development. 

The seminars are open to all 

interested UCS D community 
members as well as the general 
public and students from other 
schools. 

Patty Rosas, as istant director 
of the Center for U.S.-Mexican 
Studies, says that these seminars 
are used to inform the public about 
certain current issues that affect us 
all in some way. 

"Students especiall y need to be 
aware of the developments in U.S.-
Mexican relations," she said. 

"Mexico is one of our neigh-
bors and the Center for U.S.-Mexi-
can Studies wants to stimulate in-

terest and an exchange of ideas 
between the audience and the fac-
ulty presenters. All who attend will 
grow and learn from this experi-
ence," she said. 

Wednesday's 4 p.m. meeting 
will focus on immigrant students in 
Californ ia public schools. T his 
meeting, along wi th the other 
meetings this quarter, will be held 
on the second-floor confe rence 
room of the Institute of the Ameri-
cas Building. 

Fi ve meeti ngs are scheduled for 
the rest of the quarter, all at 3 p.m. 
They are: 

• Oct. 17. "Changing Perspec-
tives on Mexican Migration to the 
United States: From Migrant Ad-
aptation to the Cultural Policies of 
Class Fonnation." 

• Nov. 7. "Human Rights in 
Mex ico." 

• Nov. 14. "Political Implica-
tions of Restructu ring Parastatals 
in Mexico." 

• Nov. 28. "Round-table Analy-
sis of Elections in the State of 
Mexico." 

• Dec. 12. "Negotiations of a 
Free Trade Agreement Belween 
the United States and Mexico." 

Monday, October 1, 1990 The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 9 

Brazilian Dance Company to Peform at Mandeville 
Jelon Vierira's DanccBrazil 

company will perfonn at 8 p.m. 
Sunday, Oct. 14, in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

The ensemble, made up of more 
than a dozen dancers and musi -
cians, is known for its spon taneous 
perfonnances of martial arts dance 
fonns, capoeira (pronounced "kop-
warc-uh") and maculele. The pro-
ductions are colorfully costumed 
and are perfonned to Afro-Brazil-
ian music . 

Included in the program will be 
the traditional samba, Brazil's na-
tional dance, contemporary dances, 
and the hypnotic Candomble ritual 
dances depicting the orizas (Afro-
Br.lZilian gods). 

Capoeira has its roots in Africa, 
brought to Brazil by slaves. The art 
fonn was developed under the slave 
owners, the motions stylized and 
often perfonned to music to cam-
ouflage the lethal intention. His-
torically, capoeira uses the move-
ments of the feet, elbows and head, 
as the hands of the slaves were 
often manacled. 

Maculele was developed in ihe 
cane fields and evolved into a 
stylized fighting fonn, using sticks 
and steel machetes. The two arts 
were usually practiced in the slums 
of Brazil , although they were pe-
riodically banned or suppressed by 
the Braz ilian penal code as a "so-
cial infinnily." 

"Capoeira had always had a bad 
reputation. ]t is a dance which is a 
fight and a fi ght which is a dance," 
Vieira said. Many of the move-
ments of urban breakdancing ha ve 
their origins in capoeira. 

The fonn has also been used in 
such films as "Lethal Weapon" 

and " Roof top ,"and itwill be seen 
in Brooke Shields' new film , 
"Brenda Starr:' 

Since Vieira came to the United 

States in 1975,he has devoted much 
of his tin:e to teaching the fonn and 
bringing it respectability . Cur-
rently , there are more than 30 

capoeira academies across the 
country. 

Tickets for DanceBrazil are $18 
for general admission, $15 for se-

niors and $13 for students , and 
may be purchased at the UCSD 
Box Office (534-4559) or from 
TicketMaster outlets.

The Gospel According 
To the Dead Milkmen 
Interview by Jennifer Vancey, A&E Editor, and Lara Heisler, AssoclBteA&E Editor 

Imagine what it would be like to inter-
view ·five sixth-grade boys. They would be 
squirrely and impatient. They would be 
immature and nasty. They would be dirty 
and silly. Such was the case with the Dead 
Milkmen. After they performed to a full 
crowd at the BGIF on Friday, they were led 
to the Guardian offices where dley gave a 
performance of a different kind.

COMMENTARY 

Censorship? 
• Is Congress Doing the Right Thing 
for the National Endowment for Arts? 
By Christina Huizar 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

The air is hot and thick and I can/eel it as I move about my studio. My 
paints and brushes sit in a pile on the floor. So much time has passed that some 
0/ the paint tubes have hardened. My brushes have become stiff and useless. 
I want to fill my palette with Cadmium red and strike the canvas with 
thoughts. Thoughts that can come/orth in three dimensions. thick strokes 
atop thicker ones. I ache to paint pictures that wjff be exposed and not 
covered, but the stodgy man from North Carolina wouldn't like that. 

... ... ... 

In the air conditioned auditorium on Pennsylvania Avenue Senator Jesse 
Helms pokes his head over the congressional podium and screams. Surpris-
ingly, people listen. Those with paint on their hands and turpentine in their 
lungs scream back, but the stodgy man from North Carolina has a louder 
voice. 

'" '" '" 
"These are dangerous days - to say what you feel is to dig your own 

grave." - Sinead O'Connor. 

These words have become frighteningly true in the past eighteen months. 
Republican Senators Jesse Helms and Dana Robacher attacked the NationaJ 
Endowment for the Arts, questioning federal funding of controversial 
"obscene" art. The NEA which was created 25 years ago by Congress to help 
support artists of all mediums, is now being ripped apart by the very 
organization that created it. 

Here is a quick look at just what led to the initial eruption between 
Congress and the NEA and the events that followed: 

• According to U.S. News & World Report, Reverend Donald 
Wildmon got a hold of an exhibition catalog containing Andres 
Serrano's photograph "Piss Christ," which was partially funded 
through an NEA grant. The photograph depicts a plastic crucifix 
submerged ina vat of the artist's urine. 
• The AFA notified Helms of another controversial artist whose 
work was partially funded througb and NEA grant, Robert 
Mapplethorpe. Mapplethorpe 's black and white photographs, some 
homoerotic, made the senator'S eyes widen and his face redden. 
• Helms introduced an amendment to Congress which would refuse 
funding art defined as obscene and offensive. 
• The NEA did nothing in response. 
• The House voted 264-153 against allowing a vote on tbe Helms 
plan. 
• The NEA implemented a clause in the award agreement which 
requires the recipient to sign a document stating they will not 
produce any work which others might find obscene. 
• Congress cut the NEA budget by $45,000, the exact amount of 
money allocated to Serrano and Mapplethorpe combined.

And so continued tbe removaJ of the most basic of human rights -
freedom of expression. In a parallel development, more restrictions began 
to pop up in other industries -cinema, music, and theater. A precedent was 
set that one man could decide what was obscene and what was not. Out of 
fear, people in these industries began backing down rather than fighting. 

The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. was the first to back down 
when the Mapplethorpe exhibition was cancelled before it had even opened. 
Smaller venues followed for fear of Congress finding out and removing 
their funds. In Cincinnati, museum director Dennis Barrie was sent to jail 
for fighting the system and refusing to close the Mapplethorpe exhibit. Most 
artists agree that the fear of being ignored is far greater than the fear of being 
banned. 

Jesse Helms is coming up for re-election in North Carolina. Past 
experience suggests that he clings to a particu1arpolitical issue to propel him 
forward in the elections of his conservative-dominated state. First there was 
school busing, then abortion. And now art funding? 

So where are we now? Will the rush of conservatism sweeping the nation 
drive us back to the McCarthy era? Congress will adjourn on Oct. 5 to decide 
the future of the National Endowment for the Arts. Newsweek facts show us. 
that the Department of Defense receives $193 million from Congress to 
support the military bands which play patriotic reminders to high-ranking 
military personnel for ceremonial purposes. The NEA receives $22 million 
less to fund an entire nation of artists. 

This is not just an issue concerning artists. What is happening concerns 
everyone who cares about their various freedoms. The NEA represents 
artists, ideas, and movements, just as hospitals represent doctors, health 
care, and humanity. We need to join and form a voice of the common good 
that will be heard loud and clear, louder than the voice of Jesse Helms.

UCSD Student Or anization 

University Events 

Welcome 
back! 
Here are a few reminders and dates you should know about: 

.AII Student Organizations must re-register for the 
Fall Quarter by Friday, October 12, 1990 to access 
allocated ASUCSD funds for this quarter. Failure to re-register 
may result in the loss of those funds. To re-register, please see 
you UE&SA advisor for a registration packet. 

. Soon, it will be required that any student organiza-
tion event funded, in full or part, by the ASUCSD must in-
clude "Co-sponsored by ASUCSDnin its publicity (i.e., 
flyers, posters, ads, public announcements, etc.) Also, a copy 
of the flyer publicizing your event shou.ld be sent 10 the Finan-
cial Controller, and the Vice President of Finance. Newslet-
ters will be funded in the future, but will have to follow certain 
specifications. Copies of these will be required. 

• Programming budget requests for Winter Quarter 
1991 will be due on Friday, October 26, 1990 (note 
that this will be during the fifth week of the quarter, rather 
than the traditional seventh week). Budget Hearings for these 
requests will be held the following week, from October 31 , 
to November 2, 1990. 

• If your organization would like to sell food/merchan-
dise at a TG, please contact MaHhew Schnurer, Commis-
sioner of Programming, at the AS Offices. This is a good 
fundraising opportunity for your organization. 

If, at any time during the quarter, you have any questions 
regarding student organization funding, guidelines, etc., 
please feel free to call Joseph Cruz, Financial Controller or 
or Sergio Langarica, Vice President of Finance, at 534-
4450, or drop a note in one of their boxes at the AS Offices. 

What ' s New : 
• The first thing you w i ll notice is the first addition of the 
quarterly"Hotwire." It replaces the student organizations' 
quarterly newsletter as a means of communication with the 
members of student organizations and the campus as a 
whole. Save it for referencel 
• Another change, the new Student Organization informa-
tion line is 534·0501 . Linda Sargent in University Events and 
Student Activities (UE&SA) will assist you. UE&SA now has 
complete responsibility for the registration and development 
of student organizations. (The Associated Students is still the 
major funding source for student organizations an the Student 
Government Services business office staff will supervise the 
accounting for student organizations) . These three organiza-
tions will continue to work very closely together in providing 
services for you . 
• If you have suggestions on how to improve services to 
student organizations please give your suggestions to anyone 
at UE&SA.

RICKEY 
Continued from page 22 

So, how do you stop Rickey 
Henderson? Players and mangers 
have been trying to figure it out 
ever since he hit the major league 
cene in 1979. The an wer? You 

don'!. You can pitch him high, 
low, or away, but you'll risk 
walking him because of hi 
crouching stance. And a walk to 
Rickey Henderson has an uncanny 

knack of turning into a triple. So 
you pitch him down the pipe, lind 
hold your breath. 

There was a time when Hender-
on was definitely not one of the 

greate t players around. A time 
when he was still leading the AL in 
stolen bases, but also a time when 
he wa ranked among the league 
leader in strikeouts, and well ahead 
of the league in itting out games 
with questionable excu es. 

But tho e day are fewer now.

Fli;- HEWLETT 
~~ PACKARD 

Monday, October 1, 1990 

The day where he virtually had to 
carry the entire Oakland ballclub 
on his houlders are gone. The 
days when he played under 
Steinbrenner' regime intheBronx 
zoo are gone. 

Henderson has returned to his 
native land of Oakland, and he i 
playing on a team full of all-star 
whotakealotofthe pre sureaway. 
allowing Rickey to just be Rickey. 

And that ' bad news for t he rest 
of baseball. 

VI. V-BALL 
Continued from page 24 
comeback, tallying II of her 21 
kill in the final two sets, mcluding 
one that ended game four in tri-
umph for UCSD. 

The Tritons also managed to 
salvage several points in the piv-
otal fOUI1h game with sophomore 
Liz Vesanovic getting four of her 
13 digs in the game. 

"Wedugalotofball inthela t 
two games," Dannevik said. "We 
[had] the ability to concentrate and 
focus real well." 

Freshmen Jennifer Cross and 
Karen Grometer also lent added 
support, a Cross donated II kills 
and four digs, and Grometer came 
off the bench and put the Golden 
Eagles away , serving out the match 
with six straight points. 

Freshman se tte r Amy 
Banachowski spread around 60 
assists on the night. 

Saturday evening did not prove 
to be as fruitful an encounter for 
UCSD,astherewouldbenocome-
back against the Panthers, losing 
infour sets 15-10, 15-7, 1O-15,and 
15-1 2. 

The Tritons appeared to come 
out a little flat after Friday's ex-
hausting win, not putting Chapman 
away at crucial times. 

" We didn ' t come out as 
enthusiatic [against Chapman] ," 
Dannev ik said. "We let [the match] 
slip away." 

Though ranked 14th in Div ision 
II, the Panthers played somewhat 
sluggishly, offering UCSD nu-
merous opportunities for an upset. 

The Tritons, however, never 
took advantage, and were forced to 
concede their fifth 10 s. 

"Wejustdidn ' t have very much 
killer instinct," Dannevik noted. 
" I was real disappointed about 
Saturday 'S match. We have to 
learn how 10 play [back-Io-back] 
matches." 

Vesanovic led the Tritons in 
kills with 11 , while Van Duyne 
and junior Dana Simone contrib-
uted nine each. 

Although compiling a formi-
dable 19-5 overall mark, UCSD 
has yet to win a road game (0-2) 
other than in a tournament, a ten-
dency Dannevik insists must not 
continue. 

The consecutive matches over 
the weekend were the first experi-
enced by the Tritons this season, 
who will confront a similar situa-
tion with home matches against 
Cal Poly Pomona, ranked third in 
Division II, and arch-rival Divi-
sion III foe La Verne this Friday 
and Saturday. 

The Tritons host Biola Univer-
s ity in thei rnext march Wedne day 
at 7 p.m., a match which could be 
indicative of UCSD's season. 

During all five seasons in which 
the Tritons won the national 
championShip, UCSD lost its head-
to-head match with Biola , accord-
ing to a supersti tious Dannevik. 
who noted that the Tritons failed to 
advance past the regionals last sea-
son after defeating Biola.

MEET THE FUTURE 
OF CRFA1WE THINKING. 

The UCSD Guardian 

, Amiga doesn't just improve your work. It improves your 
thinking. Just working hard isn't enough anymore. 
Creative thinking is what sets winners apart. 

E ,..... j 
r::::=J... 

The Amiga computer was designed precisely with 
that thought in mind. It starts with the ability LO handle 
routine tasks, then lets you go all the way to innovation 
and invention. • 
Whatever you can imagine, Amiga 
has the power to produce. Easily. 
Its built-in technology is 
a major advancement 
in a computer of this 
size and price range. 

With a mouse and 
simple icons, Amiga com-
bines a full color display, full 
stereo sound, graphics, 3-D 
animation, video capability and 
text as no other computer can. 

It has the power to run soft-
ware sophisticated enough to 
manipulate vast amounts of data, 
as well as the creative genius to 
create the complete score for an 
orchestral composition. 
It's like tapping into the brains 
of Einstein, Bach, Galileo and 
Cecil B. DeMille all at once. 
Thanks to our new ArnigaVision;" 
an innovative authoring system, 
you can put on multimedia pres-
entations that rival Hollywood 
productions, by calling up soft-
ware for painting, scanned-in 

graphics, titling, animation, full -
motion VIdeo and audio. Then 
see and hear it all at the same 
time, on a single monitor. That's 
real multimedia! 

We deliver today, what others 
promise tomorrow. 
Amiga was designed to keep 
up with you, from schoolwork 
demands through career needs. 
You'll find standard what other 
people make optional. As well 
as sophisticated technology that 
doesn't exist on comparably 
powered and priced computers. 

Creative educational discounts 
make Amiga an easy decision. 
The Amiga Education Purchase 

Program for college and uni-
verSity students, faculty and 
administrator, offers a wide 
range of fully loaded, specially 
bundled hardware systems, with 
a complete system starting under 
$ 700~ All include a one year lim-
ited warranty and AmigaVision. 

Try Amiga on forsile, get a 
FREE J·shirt. 
The best way to make up your 
own mind about Amiga is to 
try one. Stop by your Campus 
Authorized Amiga Dealer and 
get your hands on the future of 
computing. And just for put-
ting one to the test, you'll get 
a Free T-shirt (hurry, supplies 
are limited).

YOUNG GUNS 
Continued from page 24 
is that if you ' re ajunior or senior on Ihis team, you're 
old. 

The leading vel is junior midlielder Kalyn Shea. 
Shea has played omewhat of a supponing role for the 
previous two years, but, this season she's moving into 
the spotlight as the motherly figure the kids will look 
to for leadership. 

"She's a tremendou influence," McManus said. 
Not the only influence, though. Also moving into 

a more prominent role is junior forward Karin lind-
say, who spent the previous two years coming off the 
bench. This eason, she's being counted on to pick up 
some of the lack left by Dulock's injury. 

The defense is also led by a wily vet in junior Amy 
Wayte, whom McManus said is "playing like an AU-
American at sweeper." 

If he i named All-American, Wayte will have 
made a big jump in two years. Last season, Wayte, 
along with senior defender Jennifer Kingsbury, was 
named the team's most improved player. 

Kingsbury is one of the few Tritons who returns to 
her old position. 

"She' s rock steady. She always doe!: her job, and 
she's really strong," McManus said. 

Junior Danielle Placek is another member of the 
Geritol Club, as well as the back line. 

Is it the newcomers? 
Couldbe. Rightnow,you 'resaying "Look dummy, 

what's the difference between a kid and a newcomer?" 
Hold your horses. The newcomers, primarily three, 

are actually old vets who are in their first years with the 
team. Got that? Follow closely. 

The major name among the newcomers is Diana 
Klintwonh. 

Klintworth is a two-time UCSD volleyball All-
American who played on three consecutive national 
championship teams. Having used up her four years of 
volleyball eligibility, she decided to gi ve soccer a run. 

Good idea. She' s moved in and made herself a 
fixture on defense. 

Another newcomer is goalie Karin Carper. Carper, 
ajunior, has some Louie Keleher-sized shoes to fill in 
trying to replace Friess, who remains one of the most 
vivid memories oflast season's championship drive. 

"[Carper's] very brave. Against [CS U] Dominguez 
[Hills] she went down and tookafewkicks. She's very 
aggressive on the ground," McManus said. 

The other major newcomer is junior midfielder 
Sally Weigand, who transferred crosstown from USIU. 

Okay, you've looked at the players. They 're obvi-
ously talented. But talent isn't everything. !fit was ... 
well, we already mentioned the Padres. There's gotta 

Monday, October 1, 1990 

be something else. 
Is it the offense? 
Could be. But probably not. De pite the 8-0 oul-

bur t againsl Redland , the Triton offense has been 
unusually quiet this eason. Unlike previous years, 
this team lacks the big cannon who can rack up 
mUltiple-goal games, and carry a team. 

One obviously missing element is Dulock who 
McManus admits, "we're missing bad." 

"We make up for it by being aggressive, trying to 
slrikequick, and having more of a team effon. We're 
not quite as fine e as last year," he said. 

Is it the younger players? 
Could be. Youth can be both good and bad, de-

pending on McManus ' mood. 
"They've come together really well for a young 

team," he said. 
But he also noted that because they're young, they 

tend to get "overanxious. "They're not quite as physi-
cal as I'd like, and they don 't realize when they're 
pressing or hould try somelhing unonhodox. 

"This team hasn 'tquite got the fluency of [previous 
years] . Basically, it 's just confidence. Last year, we 
were very experienced, very focused and committed. 
I didn ' t really have to coach. I could just sit back and 
watch the games," he chuckled. 

"This year I might have to do a little coaching." 
Is it the defense? 
Bingo. As in the recent past, the heart and soul of 

this team is still the defense. And it's not one of those 
fancy, chalkboard-drawn, matchup-zone 1-2-2-5 
gimmicks either. This defense is good because it's a 
team effort, all the way up and down the field. 

McManus is one coach who subscribes to the best-
defense-is-a-good-offense theory. 

"We play well together. Everyone works. We 
control the ball. I mean, if you keep the ball in your 
own 18-yard line, eventually someone' s gonna score," 
he said. 

With all the youngsters, the extended future is 
obviously in good s~ape for the Tritons. But what 
about the immediate future? 

As in postseason hopes. 
Well, the Tritons already made it over one big 

hurdle in a 3-1 win over CSU San Bernardino. Only 
one team is selected from the West region, and the 
Coyotes figure to be among the leading contenders. 

If McManus were a betting man, however, he 
would pick Methodist College (NC) to win it all. 

"They 've been knockin ' on the door for three 
straight years, and this year they 've gO! 10 players 
retumi'1g," he said. 

Still, he's not conceding anything. 
"Anything can happen in soccer. If the breaks go 

our way, and we avoid injuries, you never know." 

RICKEY: A Celebration of the .Finest 
Continued from page 24 
are 15 better than his next competitor, and his 63 stolen 
bases leads the AL by 22. But this year, he leads the 
league in on-base percentage (.441), is second in 
hilling (.326), and is third in walks with 96. 

Henderson is at least the greatest leadoff hitter of all-
time. Belter then Bobby Bonds. Better than Lou 
Brock. Even better than Pete Rose. A survey con-
ductedbythe I 990 edition of theA' s Yearbook polled 
six different former and current managers, including 
Sparky Anderson and Roger Craig. Though there 
was not unanimous consent, Henderson appeared 
atop the polls more frequently than anybody because 
of his combination of speed and power, and the utter 
mayhem he creates for pitchers and opposing manag-
ers when he is on the Dasepaths. 

And for good measure Henderson ' s .584 slugging 
pereentage places him second, and his 28 home runs 
are in sixth. Incidentally, Henderson's home run 
provided the difference in the A's West-clinching 
game last week. All this in a year when he has missed 
25 games.

1990 FALL SPORTS PREVIEW - SECOND IN A SERIES 

• The defending national champion UCSD 
women's soccer team is young, aggressive, 
and, surprisingly, ranked No.2 in the nation 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

The defending national champion U SD women's occer team is 
6-1-1, currently ranked econd in the nation, and ha allowed only two 
goals in eight game . 

It wa a while ago, but I clearly remember omeone writing (wa it 
me?) that this team wa losing six eniors to graduation, including AIl-
Ameri an defender Toni Krumme, All-National Tournament goalie 
Julie Frie ,All-American forward and leading corer Heather Mauro, 
and All-American midfielder and e ond-leading corer Felicia Faro. 

Didn't this team also 10 e forward Katy Dulock at the beginning of 
the year to a tre s fracture? Isn ' t thi the ame Dulock who two years 
ago set the all-time UCSD single season scoring record? 

Isn't thi the arne team that, despite being defending champ ,was 
generating very little re pect and con idered a non-entity among 
national champion hip contenders because it was undergoing a major 
rebuilding year? 

Boy, am I confused. Am I in the wrong La Jolla? Am I in Mexico? 
So, uh, Head Coach Brian McManu • what give ? 
"They hate to get beat. This team i willing to work like hell. 

Doe n't matter if the opponent is Divi ion I, thi team hates to lose." 
WeB, gee Coach ... that's nice, but if hating to lose were a prereq-

ui ite to winning, the San Diego Padres would be in first place. Sorry 
Coach, I don 't buy it. There's got to be more. 

Is it the kids? 
Could be. Who are the kids, you ask? Damn good que tion my man, 

eeing as how just about everyone from the Revelle custodial staff to 
Richard Atkin on i a king, "Who are the e people?" 

The kids are the eight freshmen and ophomore who make up 
almost half of the Triton ro ter. 

The kids have played a major role in the Tnlon 6-1-1 record, as 
they have filled in ju t about everywhere where an opening from last 
ea on could be found. 

The leader of the kid is Katie Ashley, a 5' 1" sophomore right wing, 
in_her first year with the team. She made the team after asking 
McManus during a P.E. course if she could try out. He said yes, and 
Ashley has emerged as an offen ive force. 

"She's been tremendous . .. just great," McManus said. 
Second-in-command of the kids is Katie Larkin, a freshman starting 

at left midfielder. Larkin has added spark to both the offense and 
defense, and is playing well above ex pectations, according to McManus. 

I it the old vet ? 
Could be. They won't like being called old, but the fact of the matter

Tritons Shoot Down Eagles 
By Ken Boulton 
Guardian Reporter 

Youth is a double-edged sword 
on any sports team: along with 
enthusiasm comes inexperience. 

The UCSDwomen'svolleyball 
team was served a dose of both in 
splitting a pair of matches against 
the Cal State Los Angeles Golden 
Eagles and the Chapman College 
Panthers this past weekend. 

Friday night's BGIF (Blue and 
Gold Incredible Friday) match and 

season home opener proved to be a 
grueling mental and physical test 
for the Tritons, having been pushed 
to five sets by CSULA before 
emerging victorious 15-3, 11-15, 
8-15, 15-7, and 15-5. 

Without breaking a sweat in the 
first game, UCSD - which went 
into the weekend ranked first na-
tionally among Division ill schools 
- soon found itself staring defeat 
in the face, down two sets to one, 
and playing uncharacteristically 

poor. 
"We lost a little bit of momen-

tum," UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik stated. "!think the [ease) 
of the first game was attributed to 
the fact that we were playing at 
home." 

The Tritons displayed excellent 
poise and regrouped, however, to 
take the final two ets by a com-
bined score of 30-12.

Rickey: A Case for MVP 
By Phil Gruen 
Senior Staff Writer 

When Rickey Hender on hits a 
home run, he knows it. And he 
makes sure the world knows it. In 
fact, you don't even have to watch 
the flight of the ball to know 
whether or not it is going to land 

COMMENTARY 
beyond the fence - you can merely 
direct your undivided attention 
towards the Oakland A ' all-star 
left field r who lam the bat down 
in triumph, glare m nacingly 

down the line as if to tell somebody 
who doubted him sitting some-
where in the right field stands be-
yond the foul pole, "I told you so," 
and begin his trademark slow gail 
around the bases, with his hands 
dangling from his wrist as if they 
were orne ort of dispossessed 
body-part. 1 he cocky? Oh yes, 
definitely. But he can be. 

He's Rickey Henderson. 
Calling somebody the best -

truly thebe t- inanysportalways 
eems to be a touchy i sue. Rickey 

Henderson i not the greate t player 

of aU-time. He is probably not the 
greatest player of today. And he 
may not even be the best player 
this ea on. 

But he ure comes close. 
Henderson can hit for power. 

He can hit for average. He can do 
th big things and the little things 
to win ballgames. He can field. 
And he can run. Boy, can he run. 

Henderson is almost alway 
amotlg the league leaders in runs 
and stolen ba e ,and this year is no 
exception. Hender on' 116 run
