A.S. 
Presidential 
Election 
Contested 
VIOLA nONS: Charges 
filed against Tesak similar 
to those against Guevara 
By Judy Wlederhom 
Associate News Editor 

Marshall College sophomore Eu-
gene Kim filed charges against AS, 
President Carla Tesak on Tuesday, 
alleging that Tesak violated seven' 
election bylaws during the recent 
presidential reelections. 

According to Muir sophomore 
Kelly Lytle, spokeswoman for Kim's 
case, Tesak violated election bylaws 
VIB(3c) and (3m), and VI(Bl) by 
claiming campaign material pub-
lished by the Union of Jewish Stu-
dents (UJS) which allegedly libeled 
her opponent, Poncho Guevara. Lytle 
alleges that although Tesak claimed 
the fliers as campaign material, she 
did not include them in her budget, 
thus violating bylaws VIq3d) and 
(4d). 

Additionally, Lytle maintains 
that Tesak violated bylaw VJB(3k) 
because the UJS flier contained a 
University Extension phone num-
ber, which is specifically prohib-
ited. Finally, Lytle alleges that 
Tesak violated one bylaw which 
mandates that candidates must 
follow election rules. 

"She {Tesak] must be held ac-
countable for the UJS mailing and 
the slander and libel. .. which it 
contains," Lytle said. 

Tesak said she was unaware of 
the specific charges filed against 
her, and declined to comment un-
til she had further information. 

"From what I can see, what con-
spired in the recent elections is a 
clear indication that the election 
process is an unrealistic and de-
ceitful one that serves to disen-
franchise the UCSD voting stu-
dent body by invalidating our 
votes," said Kim, who refers to

'Uttle Bald Eagles' 
Land on Campus 
KIDS: Fifth grade children shave their heads in 
support of classmate undergoing cancer therapy 
By FrMClsco DeVries 
Senior Steff 

It wasn 't until fifth-grader Ian

has at least 13 hats sent by admir-
ers from all over the country. The 
No Fear clothing company even 
sent a batch of custom-made "little

group. 

After he was di-
agnosed with non-
Hodgkin ' s 
Lymphoma in Feb-
ruary, Ian was ad-
vised to shave his 
hair to avoid having 
to watch it fall out 
during the treatment 
for his cancer. Thir-
teen , of Ian's class-
mates in Jim Alter's 
fifth grade class at 
Lake Elementary in 
Vista, as well as Al-
ter himsllf, decided 
to shave their heads 
with Ian.

As the story of 
the little bald . 
eagles· began to 
spread and media 
attention grew, 
Alter said that 
many of the fifth 
graders didn't 
understand why 
everyone was 
making such a 
big deal about the 
haircuts. After 
the first radio 
show put the 
group on the air, 
Alter said that 
one of his stu-
dents came up to 
him and asked, 
simply, "Why'" 

"This is an

out," Ian explained. 
But, he added, it

motherapy started

lan, and his fellow "little bald 
eagles," as they are now known, 
visited UCSD for a tour on Thurs-
day. The day turned out to have 
special significance for the group 
because the night before, Ian was 
officially pronounced in remission, 
meaning an end to his chemo-
therapy. 

The group was invited to UCSD 
by Marshall College Provost Cecil 
Lytle after he read about the little 
bald eagles in March. "You and 
your classmates (and Mr. Alter) 
have shown everyone a great les-
son in friendship and compassion," 
he wrote to Ian. 

Lytle, whose wife is currently 
undergoing chemotherapy, wrote 
that he "would like to express the 
gratitude of many" by having them 
over to UCSD for lunch and a tour 
of the campus and the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center. 

UCSD has only been one stop 
on what has turned into a media 
circus for 'Ian and his compatriots. 
Since the head-shaving was first 
reported in March, they have ap-
peared on everything from a Los 
Angeles radio show to "Good 
Morning America," and have re-
ceived free passes to visit every-
where from Disneyland to Moun-
tain High ski resort. 

Then there are the hats - at 

people help each 
other, especially kids." 

This is not to say that Alter was 
not surprised by the attention. "All 
we expected was the Vista Press to 
come up and cover it," he said. 

"We had no idea this all was 
going to happen," agreed lan's 
mother, Heather O'Gorman. 

According to those close to him, 
[an has benefited greatly from the 
support he received from his class-
mates. "He's been surrounded by 
his friends. He's never had a mo-
ment to think about what's hap-
pening," Alter said. 

Ian's recovery, from the sur-
gery and from the cancer, has been 
"incredibly fast" according to 
Heather. Ian continued to play 
baseball and go skiing throughout 
his treatment, surprising even his 
doctors. 

It has "been a real education" 
for the whole class, Alter said. 
Beyond the crash course he gave 
them on cancer and on kidneys -
after one oflan's failed and had to 
be removed - the kids are learn-
ing about life. "This has made 
them all stronger," Alter said. 

Now that the chemotherapy 
is over, most of the "little bald 
eagles" plan to let their hair 
grow back. But several said they 
are planning to keep their buzz 
haircuts - that is, as one stu-
dents said, "if their parents will 
let them."

University officials announced lISt week that the 
UCSD Medical Center will not lose the money they 
anticipated for this fiscal year as 8 result of a $3.5 
million subsidy given by the state for treating the poor. 
The state Legislature allocated several million dollars 
to hospitals that treat larae numbers of the poor under 
government programs, Including the UCSD Medical 
Center In Hillcrest. 

Interim Chief Rnanciat OffIcer for the UCSO HospI-
tals Kim Roberts said that the hospital In Hillcrest as 
well as the new Thornton Hospital In La Jolla wOuld 
have lost approximately $3 million from their operating 
budget this fiscal year because of contlnulng budget 

cuts, but the subsidy given by the legislature will 
offset the operating loss. Roberts added that the

According to Associate Vice

"When there is a potential for

Monday. May 16.1994 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: The recently passed ban on assault weapons is a strike against the freedom and saftey of Americans 

AsSAULT ON RIGHTS 
ByAnnllv ........ 
ConttibutltW Opinion Wrtter 

The House of Rep~ntalives ap-
proved I bill on May 5 which bans the 
manufacture, sale or possession of 19 
types of semiautomatic (rapid-fire) 
weapons, yet allows current ownen 
to keep these weapons and excludes 
over 650 hunting and target-shooting 
guns. Supporters of this bill say that 
these guns have no purpose other than 
to kill quicldy and efficiently. 

Thepoliticiansoo Capitol Hill have 
been arguing over what constitutes an 
assault weapon for years. After pass-
ing this bill, they have yet to reach a 
conclusion. There are no established 
statistics on how many people a~ 
killed each year by the 19 weapons 
that willbe banned, nor are the~ any 
firm numbers demonstrating how of-
ten they are used in crimes. The Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacw and Fi~­
arms provides the most accurate sta-
tistics available. 

According to the bureau, assault 
weapons account for about 1.5 to 2 
million guns out of the 200 million in 
circulation in the United States and 
account for only six to eight percent 
of the weapons UICd in criines. In 
fact, a study oouducted by Tulane 
University shows that the weapon of 
choice in shootings is not the semi-
automatic weapon, but the handgun. 

In addition, only 17 peJtICIIt of con-
victed felons buy their guns from 
licensed gun dealers, which means 
that 83 percent either steal them, 
smuggle them or purchase them on 
the black market. 

One of the major arguments for 
gun control is that the~ are far too 
many accidental shootings involvina 
chil~n who find their parents' guns. 
While this is true, a better solution to 
these accidental gun deaths is to inte-
grate the issues of gun safety into 
educational programs for children in 
the public schools. We must teach 
them about the dangers of guns just as 
we teach them about the dangers of 
crossing the s~t, talking to strang· 
ers, AIDS and drugs. 

Many parents who own guns do 
not tell their cbi1~n about them for 
fear that they will find !hem and play 
with them, resulting in an accidental 
shooting. When youngerchi~n dis-
cover guns in the house, they often do 
not realize whaI they have found. Older 
chiI~n who find guns are not edu-
cated on the the dangers of handling 
guns nor tile selllCIessness of bring-
ing them to school. Oilldren need to 
be taught proper safety proced~. 

The propoDCnts of this 1atest mea-
sure have 10ng profeaaed that banning 
semiautomatic weapons, and eventu-
ally all firearms, will greatly diminish 

Only 17 percent of 
convicted felons

the number of guns owned by people 
in this countly, thus curtailing the 
widesprud violence on our streets. 

The truth is that the aime rate is 

only minimally affected by the prohi-
bition of guns, and criminals have 
8CCIC5I to guns whether or not they are 
legally available. The gun~lrollaws 
in Washington, D.C., prohibit aU band-
gun sales, and hunters may only have 
riDes or shotguns if they are kept 
unloaded and disassembled; the city 
nevertheless has the highest crime 
rate in the country. 

Another myth propagated by gun. 
control advocates is that most mur-
derers kiU because a gun is readily 
available to them at the moment of the 
crime. In reality, nearly every study of 
homicide shows that the majority of 
murderers are career criminals with 
lifelong histories of violence. These 
are people who methodically plan their 
actions and have a total disregard for 
human life and the laws of the land. 
Even if a gun is not available to them 
when they want it, criminals still find 
other means to hurt and kill people. 

Some of the most notorious mur-
ders in modem history did not involve 
guns. In 1969, Charles Manson and 
his "family" of cult members, some of 
the most infamous murderers in the 
United States, did not shoot any of 
their victims, but stabbed them to 
death. ID 1982, 12 people were killed 
in a mass-poisoning involving Extra-
Strength Tylenol capsules which had 
been laced with cyanide. More ~-

cendy, terrorists hombed the World 
Trade Center, killing six people, in-
juring over 1,000 others and tearing a 
five-story hole into the building. 

This new gun-(X)ntrol measure is 
not only an infringement on our rights 
as citizens of the United States, but is 
actually causing a rush of people buy-
ing larger quantities of these weapons 
- including the Vzi, the TRC-9 and 
tbe Street Sweeper - before the law 
goes into effect. The last time there 
was such a rush to buy guns was 
during the los Angeles riots, when 
IXllice retreated and people felt like 
tbey had protect themselves from the 
thieves, arsonists and thugs who 
roamed the streets. 

The knee-jerk reaction of many 
IXlliticians to shootings-gone-public 
is to place greater restrictions on the 
legal availability of guns, regardless 
of the fact that citizens who own guns 
for self-defense purposes are greatly 
hurt by such actions. These politi-
cians are dealing with the method of 
murder rather tban the cause: the indi-
vidual who pulls the trigger. Instead 
of blaming the guns that violent crimi-
nals use, we need to place more em-
phasis on criminals themselves by 
eliminating plea-bargaining, particu-
larly by mass murders, and requiring 
tougher sentences for criminals in 
general.

6 OPINION The UCSD GuanIi ... MODda" Ma,16, 1994 

WE MUST NOT LET THE ACTIONS OF A FEw DIVIDE Us 
EdItor: 

During Spring Quarter a number 
of acts of vandalism and graffiti and 
the statements of a few have raised 
deep concerns among members of the 
campus community and many of our 
friends and supporters in the greater 
San Diego community. I share these 
concerns and ask that all individuals 
of goodwill join together and not al-
low theseoocurrences to promote big-
otry, prejudice and animosity toward 
individuals and groups. 

As an institution dedicated to aca-
demic freedom and the pursuit of 
knowledge and truth, our campus 
should neither foster nor condone ha-
tred and prejudice. We must constantly 
strive to find positive ways to engage 
and learn from the rich diversity of 
California and our campus. We must 
all be committed to free and open dis-
cussion of the diverse beliefs and ideas 
which exist in our community without 
resort to incivility, ad IwminmI attacks 
or appeals to prejudice and fear. 

Our society is far from perfect; 
prejudice and discrimination, inequi-
ties and inequalities of opportunity 
still exist. These failings also exist on 
our campus, and our progress toward 
affirmative action, diversity and aca-
demic excellence goals are far from 
satisfactory. Nevertheless, we must not 
let these failings or the acts of a few 
divide or distract us from our shared 
goals as an academic community.

......... 1I.I.d 
And Inaccurate 
EdItor: 

I have long ago given up on ex-
pecting even a shred of journalistic 
integrity from the Guarditul, and I am 
tired of writing letters to correct its 
mistakes. But I feel that I have to write 
just one more because the campus 
desetves better than the biased mis-
representations and outright lies that 
il is subjected to every Monday and 
Thursday. 

I have had an opportunity to 00-
serve many of the recent events on 
campus firsthand, and your cover· 
age has left me outraged by the mn-
sistent stringofinaccuracies that have 
been presented. During the A.S.elec-
tions, your endorsements of candi-
dates and referenda questions clearly 
showed a lack of understanding of 
the issues involved. That is not sur-
prising, given the fact that no one 
from your paper even bothered to 
contact anyone on council regarding 
the referenda. 

The same election issue also in-
cluded such callous errors as end0rs-
ing one candidate for AS. program-
ming while checking her opponent's 
box on the sample ballot. In a later 
issue, you boldly ran a picture of 
Emelyn de la Peiia with a caption 
identifying her as "vice president ad-
ministrative." As it turned out, the 
voting students had other plans. 

Just when I thought it could get no 
worac, along came the Nation of Is-

lam (N01) forum. The event was so 
full of racist hate speech that it left 
some audience members ia tears, yet 
the Guarditut cbosc not to print a 
single anti-Semitic quote. After read-
ing the GuardUuJ's version of the 
event one could almosI come away 
with the feeling that the commotion 
was rno&dy the fault of the Union of 
Jewish Students. 

I will not even go into detail about 
the recent cove ... of the Judicial 
Board cases, both of which I attended. 
Suffice to say that the students are 
being grossly misinformed. 

But I must contend that your May 

9 issue reac:bed new 1ows. When four 
people wrote letters saying that Pon-
cho Guevara was seen giving the NOI 
a standingovatioo, you wrote editors' 
notes after each letter claiming that 
you bad "evidence" to the contrary. 
But where was youredilors' note when 
Steve Lutz based an entire opinion 
editorial on the false assumption that 
RandoIphSiwabessyservedasajudge 
on the Judicial Board? He was a 
spokesman for the prosecution, not a 
judgel 

'lbcn in the very same issue, you . 
editorialized that Carla Tesak won 
her position through "politicking. not 
by being elected." Excuse me. but I 
seem to remember 1,752 students lin-
ing up to do something on Tuesday 
and Wednesday oflut week. In fact, 
turnout was greater than that of the 
general election, and Tesak won a 
dear 58 pefClCnt majority. But let me 
guess, according to the Guardian's 
"evidence" those elections never hap-
pened. 

By the way, there's no need to put 
an editors' note aftcr this one. By now 
we all know that the Guardian stands 
by its biased journalism. 

EDIotKamla 

EdItor: 
As the A.S. election fiasco boils 

down to a simmer andstudcnts begin 
to forget this year's circus elections, 
we also forget to rectify the injustices 

forced upon the UCSDstudent body. 
I believe there is a larger picture 

that needs to be examined beyond 
the injustices done unto the candi-
dates sponsored by the SAAC fliers. 
When the Judicial Board invalidated 
the victories of Guevara, Craig and 
FaIk, they invalidated the rights of 
the UCSD students who voted in 
these elections. 'The invalidation of 
candidates indicated to the student 
body that voting is a mere formality 
and thatA.S. positions are appointed 
rather than elec:tod. It is important 
that the Judicial Board fully under-
stand the consequences of its ac-
tions. Because of the printing of 
SAAC endorsement fliers. the Judi-
cial Board justified the disenfran-
chisement of the entire student vot-
ing population. 

To address these injusticbs, I ask 
that all candidates be held equally 
responsible for their accountability 
to the election bylaws. As Tcsak 
panicipated in the slandering of 
Guevara's political reputation dur-
ing the second election, she violated 
these bylaws. 

It is auciaI that attempts be made 
to rectify the injustices do unto the 
student body to- prevent further era-
sionoftheelectoral process at UCSD. 
One may say my attempts arc use-
less, then again, so was my vote.

LEGISLA11JRE: 
Bonds slated to 
increase construction 
ContInued from ..... 1 
Vaughan Hml at SIO. Also in-
cluded would be' space renovation 
for the Biology Department on 
campus, and the expansion and 
consolidation of undergraduate 
teaching laboratories. In addition, 
there would be construction of a 
new North Annex at the School of 
Medicine to meet seismic stan-
dards. 

Assistant Vice ChanceHor of 
UCSD Facilities Design and Con-
struction Boone Hellman said that 
he supports Proposition IC. 

"In general, UCSD has had a 
very ambitious capital improve- . 
ment program for the past eight to 
nine years, and we've had tremen-
dous expansion plans for this cam-
pus, both teaching and resource 
facilities . Proposition ICwill pro-
vide us additional funds for addi-
tional changes," Hellman said. 

Hellman cited projects such as 
laboratory and mechanical system 
repair as crucial. "Some systems 
are in despcra~ need of renova-
tion and rehabilitation and need to 
meet the standards of construction 
codes because the research going 
on inside these buildings is con-
stantly expanding," he said. 

There are also renovations plans 
for the various San Diego commu-
nity colleges, as well as San Diego 
State University, to instaH disabled 
ramps and seismically upgrade 
classroom buildings. 

"If California is to regain its 
greatness, we must invest in our 
community colleges and state uni-

versities," said Senator Gary Han. 
author of Proposition I C and chair 
of the Senate Education Commit-
tee. "Since 1985, state suppon for 
public higher education systems 
has declined by one-third. That 
trend must be reversed if we are to 
have an economy that is strong . 
and growing." 

Economists estimate that 65 
percent of the new jobs created in 
the next five years will require 
some form of college education. 
In addition, an increasing number 
of older Californians arc having to 
return to college for skill and job 
retraining. 

"All Californians benefit from 
a healthy higher education sys-
tem, whether you arc a recent high 
school graduate planning for your 
career or & recently out-of-work 
Californian in need of job retrain-
ing," said Molly CorbeU Broad, 
chair of Californians for Higher 
Education, the campaign commit-
tee in support of Propositon 1C. 
"Public higher education is a re-
source we must all protect." 

Broad also said that because 
Proposition IC will help struc-
turally strengthen buildings on 
college campuses it will help 
mitigate injuries and lessen 
costly damages from future 
earthquakes. "The images from 
California State University at 
Northridge arc still fresh in the 
minds of many Californians, 
and they arc images that we do 
notwant repeated," Broad said. 

Opponents of Proposition lC 
contend in their ballot argument 
that students should bear the en-
tire cost of their education, includ-
ing the cost of facilities. Hellman 
acknowledged that with the recent 

The UCSD Guardiao 

focus on student fee increases and 
negative presa on the UC system, 
Proposition IC might not pass. 

"I'm hopeful it will pass, but 
I'm skeptical. The voting public 
of California is geUing tired of 
bond isaues and in general, the 
recent bad press of the UC sys-
tem," Hellman said. 
.Two.t.te ...... - ..... 
T ......... KatII .... Iro .. 

In addition to Proposition IC, 
California State Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown has proposed to 
finance university projects through 
two separate bond sales. The first, 
a $66- million bond, will finance 
construction projccts at UCSD, UC 
Riverside and UC Santa Barbara. 
UCSD will receive approximately 
S12.7 million to construct a 
45,OOO-square-foot Social Sci-
ences Building for the Depart-
ments and Programs of Anthro-
pology, Ethnic Studies, Political 
Science and Sociology. Expected 
to be completed by August of 1995, 
the facility will include self-in-
structionallaboratories, a com put-
ing facility and an archive room. 

In addition, Brown has initi-
ated another $307 million bond to 
help fmance educational projects 
at each of the nine UC campuses 
and create jobs for the local econo-
mies. Brown said the projects, 
which range from student hous-
ing, health service facilities and 
parking sturctures to academic fa-
cilities, bookstores, conference 
centers and seismic upgrades, will 
be refinanced in whole or in part 
with the proceeds from the sale. 
All are expected to be completed 
by May, 1997. 

The UCSD projects to benefit 
from the Brown bond will be up-

grading of the Physical Oceanog-
raphy Building, the Warren Col-
lege Student Housing facility, 
RIMAC and the School of Medi-
cine Administrative Services 
Building. 

"They are two different bond 
sales, financing different bond 
projects. We sell bonds, in addi-
tion to [having] voter-approved 
bonds to help the state's public 
universities to finance a range of 
projects, especially quality educa-
tion," said Brown's press secre-
tary Jennifer Openshaw.

ABUSE: In the often high-pressure environment of studying and 
socializing at UCSD, some students tum to. alcohol and other 
drugs as a way of dealing with their problems 
By .. nih Pitt. 
St,." Writer 

I N 114!! FOUR OR FIVE YEARS 114I!Y SPI!ND AT college, many students have to bal-ance heavy course loads, part-time jobs and involvement in clubs and organizations along with their social 
lives. Free from the restrictive eyes of par-
ents and community, students may tum to 
alcohol and other mind-altering substances 
as a form of experimentation, celebration, 
relaxation or as an escape from the pres-
sures of school and work. 

However, substance use may become a 
detrimental habit or addiction requiring in-
tervention from counselors, friends and 
loved ones. As students are well aware, 

percent of all males and five percent of all 
females wiU heavily use drugs or alcohol. 
He added that this number is "extremely 
conservative and not necessarily an accu-
rate reflection of what I encounter in coun-
seling." 

Not all abuse starts in the college years. 
Most experimentation begins earlier in the 
teens and then escalates to heavier use. By 
the time students reach a level of break-
down, a majority' have been long-term us-
ers. 

"Approximately 60 percent of students 
that describe themselves as addicts prob-
ably began usage in junior high school or 
earlier," Munoz said, adding that only 10 to 
15 percent of students slide into addiction 

what starts out as fun can 
quickly snowball out of con-
trol. 

GUARDIAN as a result of substance use beginning in their college 
years. 

For many students, part 
of the college experience 
involves exploration and a 

FEHTURES For the students inter-
viewed, the results of heavy 
drinking can be serious, 

leading to violence, injury or the destruc-
tion of relationships. 

search for self-knowledge. The notion of 
"it's now or never" hangs over many stu-
dents' heads reminding them not to forego 
any new experience up at the apex of their 
youth and freedom. 

Some students turn to the bottle as a 
refuge from stress, as the balance between 
studying and socializing becomes unstable 
and too much to bear. 

"Usually when I drink, I drink heavily. 
There's usually a hangover the next day 
... Like last night, 1 had a quiz and a midterm 
to study for, but 1 went out drinking," said 
Warren College junior Mike Dobbins, who 
acknowleges that he abuses alcohol. "I do 
abuse it. You just want to alter your state of 
mind. It 's really relaxing." 

Psychologist Dan Munoz, of UCSD's 
Psychological and Counseling Services, 
said there are generally three levels of dif-
ferentiation used to discuss alcohol and 
substance abuse. There are "users," "abus-
ers" and "addicts." According to Munoz, 
one cannot easily assign these categories to 
peop!e because there are many factors that 
contribute to each individual's ·struggle, 
such as the pressure of academics, peers 
and romantic relationships. 

"It could be [that I drink] be-
cause of stress, or out of sheer 
boredom, just [as an] everyday ac-
tivity," said Dobbins. . 

According to a Revelle College sopho-
more, drinking is a way to celebrate the end 
of his work week. 

"I work hard all week, so when the 
weekend comes I just want to relax and 
have fun, [which I do] by partying, " he said. 

For others, alcohol abuse can be a matter 
of not knowing when to lay when. 

'" know I can control the frequency of 
[how often] , drink, but once' start drink~ 
ing, I do have a problem stopping. To me, 
beer is like potato chips, you can't just have 
one," Dobbins said. 

Munoz said that he aslcs the students he 
counsels to determine which category they 
might fit into. In this ·way, users must 
acknowledge their problem, a step which 
helps them understand and overcome it. 

According to Muftoz, research shows 
that between the ages of 18 and 22, 15 

"You make an ass out of yourself. I've 
ended up in bed with strange-looking things 
... I've made stupid decisions - walking 
home from parties, getting lost, barfing on 
people's cars or in people's houses. I can 
honestly say I've lost a few friends because 
of it," said Dobbins. 

"[One of my friends] gets really violent 
and he doesn't realize it because of the 
alcohol. He gets into a lot of fights when he 
drinks," said a Revelle College sophomore. 

Students come to Munoz and his staff of 
peer counselors for various reasons. Some 
students reach a low point and want help; 
others are referred to counseling sessions as 
a a disciplinary requirement from their col-
lege. According to Munoz, 10 to 20 per-
cent of the students who are 
part of the alcohol 
and sub-

stance abuse program are required to attend 
because of diaciplinary issues. 

"Substance abuse is seldom the fiRt rea-
son reported for visits [to the peer counsel-
ing office J," said Genie Maoeci, who runs 
the peer counseling program at UCSD. She 
added that a student's dependency is usu-
ally revealed later in counseling sessions as 
they talk about how alcohol and drugs con-
tribute to other problems in their lives. 

Peer counselor Michele Miller, a senior 
at Marshall College, said that it is very hard 
for those who deal with substance abuse to 
acknowlege they have a problem because It 
is such a sensitive issue. Miller said she 
encounters a lot of denial from the students 
who are sent to peer counselina because 
Ihey generally do not think they have a 
problem. 

"There is a stigma attached to substance 

abuse which does not allow for an inflated 
account of addictioo [among students who 
go to peer COUDICUnaJ," abe said. 

It is also difficult to enlist students in the 
support pro8fIIDI which Psychological and 
Counseling Services provide, such as peer 
counseling. Miller added that abuse and 
addiction is not a topic that .one can ap-
proach people about in public. Aside from 
rcqulringstudents to attend counseling, there 
is not much one can do until a student wants 
help. 

Munoz said that participation in the de-
pendency programs generally increases 
around November and during Spring Quar-
ter. According to Munoz, the holiday sea-
son, which starts with Thanksgiving, tends 
to generate depression, and people abuse 
drugs and alcohol at a more significant rate 
around this time. As a result of this increase, 

students may decide they are in need of 
counseling.

which is mediated by Mui\oz meets every

Office.

SuD .God Festival Secmity Increased 
By ErIk Johneon 
St,.ff Writer 

This Friday's Sun God Festival 
will be bigger, better and feature 
more entertainment than ever be-
fore, but according to festival chair 
Cecelia Lucero, it will also in-
clude nearly twice as much secu-
rity as last year's festival. 

The event has been growing 
every year, and after numerous 
security problems last year Lucero 
and UCSD Police Sergeant 
Hutch"inson said they felt the need 
for extra security. 

"Last year it took almost a half 
an hour to walk from one side of 
the plaza to the other," Lucero 
said. "The day after the festival, 
the fire marshal called." 

"It looks I ike a lot more officers 
from the standpoint of numbers, 
but it's less police and more stu-
dent security officers," said 
Lucero. 

"It's a bummer from the stand-
point of funds, but we do need the 
extra security," said A.S. Com-
missioner of Programmer Jessica 
Nathanson, who is assisting Lucero 
with organization of the event. 

Lucero said she hopes that 
this year programmers will 
monitor the number of people 
in the plaza more carefully and 
keep it closer to the 11,000-
person maximum occ;upancy 
level. 

The festival has always been a 
problem for organizeR because of 
its size. Last year, UC police rep-
resentatives said that due to "alco-
hol abuse, injuries, arrests and 

slam-dancing, the UCSD Police 
Department will not approve this 
event for evening houR." The fes-
tival, however, went on as planned. 

Lucero said that Hutchinson, 
this year's new police representa-
tive, is in charge of approving se-
curity, and he has made every ef-
fort to work with the event's orga-
nizers. "We learned a lot from our 
mistakes last year," Lucero said. 

This year's affair will fea-
ture 67 student organizations, 
up from 55 last year. Accord-
ing to festival programmers, 
there will be more of a "c'arni-
val atmosphere," including cot-
ton candy, sumo wrestling and 
an inverted bungee. 

A dunk tank featuring several 
campus notables will also be part 
of the festivities. "Dr. Watson 
agreed to do the dunk tank, "Lucero 
said, "but he had to cancel because 
he won't be in town." A.S. Com-
missioner of Operations and Ser-
vices Wally Lockwood, AS. Presi-
dent Carla Tesak and former A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming 
Robb Earnest have agreed to take 
the plunge, as has student organi-
zations advisor Paul Dewine. 
Lucero said that she is open to 
student suggestions for additional 
people to s.it in the tank. 

The day's events will culmi-
nate with the evening concert at 
the Price Center, featuring bands 
Tiley Might Be Giants, No 
Doubt, Frente!, and Brian 
Dewan. During the day, music 
will be provided by KSDT and 
92.5 The Flash. 

Another format change is that 
Porter's Pub and Round Table 
Pizza will be open later than last 
year, when they were forced 10 
close at 7 p.m. Lucero encourages 
students to party responsibly and 
said that if students cannot walk 
into the Price Center unassisted 
they will not be admitted. 

Next year the festival may be 
moved to the RIMAC facility to 
overcome staging problems at the 
Price Center. Lucero said that there 
has also been talk of increasing the 
duration of the festival to a several 
days, with more campus and ad-
ministration involvement. 

Other upcoming A.S. pro-
gramming events include a free 
TGIO concert on June 3, featur-
ing an undisclosed band that 
programmers say is currently 
receiving "tremendous San Di-
ego airplsy."

THE UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Cycling 

It WU obvious that the 
UCSD cycling team Iwt the 
froat-numers it needed toc:ap-
tare the rilor08s Western 
Coafmace Cyclina awn· 

piOMbips (Wccc.) on May 7, but a slight 
lack in team deptb undermined the squada' 
brilliant national qualifyinl outing two 
weekend' • ..,. 

UCSD bcIded into the WCCCS at the 
Univenity of Nevada .t Reno deadlocked in 
a fint-place tie with defendina national cbam· 
pion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and barely 
ahead of hard-cbarJing Stanford. 

Despite illlPirinl performances from a 
number of Triton cyclers, Cal Poly and 
Stanford edged out the San Diego contingent 

in the three-event format. However, all three 
squads quali6ed for the United States Colle· 
giate Cycling Assocation Championships to 
be held May 21·22 in Wichitaw Falls, Texas . 

A·team staple Glenn Sanders dominated 
the field in the regionals' opening event, the 
56-mile Caughlin Road Race. A solo 

breakaway in the final S.S·mile lap uaured 
him first place, while Adam UviDpton aossed 
in 10th place. 

In the men's 0 race, Tim Knudsen pedaled 
to a fifth-place performance in the 44-mile 
event. Knudsen wu able to bold OIl durins a 
small pack sprint thanb to his climbiDa abil-
ity and stamina at high altitudes. 

In the men's D race, Ben Boones, who hu 
come into form in time for the final raca of 
the seaIIOII, pulJedoffasixt1s-place taUy. Team-
mate Kevin Lunde followed him closely in 
ninth place. 

Kate EIJIey of the women's 0 team show. 
cased her climbing abilities in a strong 
women's competition, where she took third. 

After the first event, UCSD found itself in 
third place behind Cal 
Poly, whose depth 
proved to be the dif· 
ference in the final 
scores . 

In the team time· 
trial event, UCSD's 
five·m.n A·team 
contingent, consist-
ing of Sanders, Dave 
Edw.rds, Ian Bet· 
tinger, Livingston 
and Lee Lefkowitz, 
suffered a heartbreak· 
ing one·second loss 
to a strong UC Davis 
squad despite a thrill· 
ing sprint at the end. 

The women's A 
team, which included 
Esther Davis, Rachel 

Tobin, Karina Francis, Rachel Kay and E1sley 
fmished two minutes behind favored Stanford 
for a seventh-plac:e time trial. 

With two of the three events completed, 
UCSD was firmly entrenched in third place, 
but Stanford's second-place lead was shrink· 
ing while Cal Poly had maintained its stroDg· 

hold on first. 
1be UNR Criterium was the final event of 

the weekend with a O.9·mile lap courae that 
included a 40 mile-per·hour downhill race 
IDCI a steep SO-metcr climb that led to the 
finish. 

Sanders once apin led the men's A team, 
positioning himself in a four-man brealtaw.y 
midway through the race. He kept pace with 
the front-runners and placed fourth as he 
croucd the line in a wild final sprint. 

Ryan Cady captured second for the men's 
B team, while teammates Dylan McReynolds 
IDCI Knudsen took sixth and seventh, respec· 
tively. The strong showing by all three riders 
confirmed that the Bs were not to be taken 
lightly. 

Jed Brintzenhoffhad some technical prob-
lems wilh his bike in the men's C race and 
ended up riding a borrowed bike, but managed 
to overcome his difficulties for a fourth·place 
finish.

tionals were cut short after a disappointing 
opening day of competition at the 1994 West 
Coast Regionals held in Santa Barbara last 
weekend. 

Saturday's venue placed the UC San Di-
ego Air Squids in pool play to determine 
which squads would qualify for tournament 
play and ultimately .dvance to the national 
event. 

Although the team played well on a day 
when il needed to be at ita best, an uncharac· 
teristic 1-4 record stifled any ideas of moving 
on to tournament play. 

Out UCSD's losing' record was certainly 
not indicative of its level of play, as the Air 
Squids threatened to upsel both UC Berkeley 

Bonnes remained impressive, c:apturiDs 
sixth in the men's D competition and proviD& 
once again that he is an up-and-coming rider 
for the team. 

In the women's A race, the pack quietly 
split into two groups. Davis stayed in tight 
with the first pack IDCI emerged in fifth after 
the final sprint. Tobin wu also able to sprint 
from the second pack to elllUl'e heraelf a 12th· 
place finish. 

Finally, in the women '. B race, FJsley took 
seventh place to cap off her solid weekend . 

In a repeat of last yeu's performance, Cal 
Poly SLO captured the Western Conference 
Cllampionship and Stanford held onto a nar· 
row lead, defeating UCSD by 12 points to 
take second pl.ce. 

The Tritons' third-place finish in one of 
the nation's toughest conferenc:es was suffi-
cient enough to advance them to Nationals 
later this month.

and Las Positas College in the morning's 
early rounds. Unfortunately, Cal came up 
with big plays in the clutch, winning 11·8. In 
an emotional contest, Las Positas also outlasted 
UCSD,11·9 . 

UCSD then had to contend with Humbolt 
State, which scorched it 11-4, and I multi-
talented University of Oregon squad, which 
squashed the Air Squids by a final tally of 11-
3. 

UCSD's lone win of the day came in lhe 
final contest. The Air Squids jumped allover 
the Stanford 0 team early, successfully taking 
advantage of key turnovers to record an 11-6 
triumph. 

While the team 's season was prematurely 
baited, it can still look back on a successful 
season that showed remarltable improvement 
for the young Air Squid squad.

'The win over South set up a cru-
cial semifinal club against number-
one seed Trinity. They had met once 
before in April, and UCSD had 
walked away from the contest worse 
for the wear. 

However. LaPlante and company 
have come a long \Vay since that 
earlier defeat, and this time they 
managed to tum the tables on the 
favorite. 6-3. 

Again. the combination of 
Takemoto-Wilbur proved to be the 
key factor. Against a tough Feulner-
Klemmer team, they managed to 
eek out a 7-5. 7-5 win that clinched 
the victory. 

UCSD Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
is no stranger to the the chamfion-
ship scene. 'The 1994 NCAA: Na-
tional banner is the fourth in her 
illustrious coachingc:areer81 UCSD, 
the others coming in 1985. 1987 and 
1989. 

"We hadn't won it for five years; 
[the championship] was a nice thing 
to have," LaPlante said. "This is a 
special team. Everyone is so to-
gether."

without telling his opponent exactly 
what he thinks of his mother? 

I'll be frank - I enjoy a good 
fight as much as the next guy, but, 
hey, this is basketball, not hockey. 
We'vecof1le to expect violence from 
the pucksters, not the hoopsters. 
Hockey is so famous for its fighting 
that Rodney Dangerfield once re-
marked, "I went to a fight the other 
night. and a hockey game broke 
out" Perhaps the same could be said 
of basketball. 

No matter how many times [ 
sprinted back to the television for 
the replay of that solid left-right 
combination to English's forehead, 
I couldn't help but wonder how this 
disruptive violence was tainting the 
image of the game. 

The problem isn't restric:ted to 
basketball, thoUgh. These days. 
when a batter gets hit with a pitch in 
a Major League baseball lame, he 
will more often than not charge !he 
mound. triggering a bench-c:learing 
hunicane of punches on the mound. 

It's not like !he old days when 
the guys "took one for the leam." 
Now a man doesn't simply walk to 
first base and "play ball." he bies to 
separate the pitcher from his head 
with one mighty swing of his arm. 
As the commissioners struale to 
determine the cause of the hot tem-
pers. the common buuword among 
the athletes has been respect. 

After onother recent brawl be-
tween the NBA's Atlanta Hawks

he couldn't stand there and take !he

DUFFERS' DEUGHT: 
UCSD golfers prepare to 
defend 1993 NCAA 
National Championship 
8yG,..WNM 
Senior St." Writer 

UCSD golf Head Coacb Mike 
Wydra finds himself in a familiar 
spot at this week's Division III Na-
tional OIampionships. This time, 
however, he bas more questions than 
answers going into the NCAAs. 

The Tritons have had a solid sec-
ond half of the season and arc again 
peaking at the right time, but as 
UCSD begins its national title de-
fense tomorrow at the King's Grant 
Country aub in Fayetteville, North 
Carolina, Wydra must try to upset 
heavily favored Methodist. 

Not only does Methodist boast 
last year's individual titlist, junior 
Ryan Jenkins, but King's Grant is 
Methodist's bome rourse to boot. 
To top it all off, before UCSD won 
the 1993 title, Methodist had cap-
tured three cbampionships in a row. 

"We'd probably have to steal this 
one away from them," Wydra said. 

But Wydra has not given up hope 
even though two of his five golfers, 
Mike Hartford and Arnie Campbell, 
are frea.bmen ud a third, Brock 
Shafer, sat out the entire season with 
a broken leg. 

Fortunately, his other two golf-
ers are still playing well. Dale 
Abraham, who has been the team's 
top golfer all year, is "playing the 
best golf of his career, " according to 
Wydra. Besides Abraham, UCSD 
will rely on Tom Brown, who the 
roach wls, "a very smart player, 
the consummate manager," to spear-
head the Triton attack. . 

As for Shafer, the national tour-
nament will be his first competition 
since hi. injury. The junior has been 
busy rehabilitating and was able to 
play 36 boles lut Monday, but is 
still trying to get back on his game. 
"Once the flag ia up, he'll play bet-

SPORTS 17 

Oen McDowell/Gun,., 
UCSO'. Mike Hlrttord hopea to chip In tow..,. Tritons' title .......... 
ter," said Wydra. 

Hartford, the Tritons' "freshman 
phenom," certainly has the skills to 
have an impact forUCSD. He has 
been averaging only slightly higher 
scores than those of graduated 
UCSD All-American Jeremy Moe, 

and Wydra promises that "if Hart-
ford isn't Freshman of the Year at 
this tournament then I'll eat my hat. " 

Campbell bas carried his share 
of the load as well and is looking 
forward to tbe opportunity to com-
pete on the national level. 

"We stand a good chance be-
cause we've rome on strong in the 
second halfofthe season. As forme, 
['m just going to try and help the 
team out," Cambell said. 

Wydra is concerned about 
Shafer'S uncertain health, for if he 
gets injured, the two freshmen will 
be under enormous pressure to per· 
form well. 

Campbell remains unconcerned. 
"I'm kind of nervous, but I'm look-
ing forward to the rompetition," he 
said. "We just have to ignore the 
pressure and go out and play." 

Wydra. though optimistic about 
his team's chances, remains cau-
tious. 

"Methodist is clearly the favor-
ite, based on talent and intangibles," 
the coacb said. "But we've played 
with Division I teams this year that 
could handle Methodist on their 
worst day. We're just looking for a 
chink in their armor." 

Wydra has trained his team well 
in case that chink ever becomes large 
enough to exploit. 

For instance, to instill discipline 
in his Tritons, the roach mandates 
that anyone wbo misses a putt and is 
left with an easy one-to two-footer 
must mark his ball first before lip-
ping it in. Failure to do so is pun-
isbed by forcing the player to pur-
chase dinner for the rest of the team. 

There was no comment from 
Wydra on how often team members 
have suddenly found their ball mark-
ers stolen after missing a putt.

NCAA Division III

doing so, the Tritons 
captured their fourth 
national champion-
ship. 

While the final 
game was much 
closer than the lop-
sided score indicated, 
UCSD prevailed in 
five of the six hotly-contested singles 
match ups. 

Diane Chandler's rousing victory in a mara-
thon match at the number-one singles spot 
proved to be the title clincher. 

"Diane stayed in t.he rallies and ran down

Fortunately for 
tbe Tritons, Chandler has a habit of playing 
her best at the Nationals. After stumbling 
through what was, for her, a sub-par season, 
everything finally came together for the Tri-
tons' top player. 

"It washer best win of the season," LaPlante 
said. "Sbe peaked at the right time." 

Michelle Malephansukul's conquest of 
Porter Harris at the number-two spot was 
equaJly instrumental in UCSD's victory. 
Though only a fresbman, sbe displayed matu-

Number-three Hilary Somers, who had 
been a central cog in UCSD's lineup all yeu, 
simply owned Williams' Julie Greenwood (6-

record in the Tritons' run to the title.

defeating her counterput, Sabrina Oel, at tbe 
number-five bole. After running away with 
tbe first set, 6-3, Wilbur battled Ocl to tbe wire

CALL FOR DESIGNS 
, ELEANOR ROOSEVELT COLLEGE 

Since Fifth College was founded , a 
wing-like brush stroke above an 
abstract globe has identified the 
mission and spirit of the college. 
With the adoption of the name 
Eleanor Roosevelt, it is time to 
incorporate our existing symbol into 
a logo with the new name or to 
choose a new, perhaps even more 
fitting symbol and logo. 

An honorarium of up to $300 will be paid for camera-
ready copy of the deSign that Is chosen. A good logo 
will 1) reflect the essence of the mission of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College , 2) be simple and instafltly 
recognizable, 3) be suitable for use at different scales 
of size, and 4) be readily reproducible . 

SUBMIT DESIGNS BY JUNE 15, 1~, camera ready 
or nearly so, in black & white on &.5xll ' stock, to 
Provost, Eleanor Roosevelt College (0069), UCSD, 
9500 Gilman Dr., La JOlla, CA 92093-0069. Attach 
name, address & phone. Pick up Info flyer at 412 UCtr.

awarded Slippery Rock the premier. 
seed heading into this year's top-
eight team field. 

"We knew what kind of compe-
tition Slippery Rock bad to deal 
with over in the East," Harper said. 
"But I didn' t mind going in as the 
underdog. We knew what we had to 
do and we did it." 

And once again the Tritons did it 
with defense, stifling Slippery 
Rock's potent offense and especially 
its leading-scorer Tracy Proietti (16 
goals). 

Freshman Shawna Caballero, 
Allison "Blender" Dunn, Brandy 
Rost and goalie Leona Mason 
worked the team-oriented drop-back 
defense to sheer perfection, deflat-
ing the Rock's 11.6 goals-per-game 
average. 

All-American two-meter 
standout Julie Swail paced the Tri-
ton offense throughout the title run. 

The Tritons opened the tourna-
ment on Friday by slamming Mary-
land 15-2 in a very one-sided affair. 
Both Mason and reserve Dana Byrd 
saw plenty of action in the cage 
while Alison Westfall (tbree goals), 
Rost (three goals) and Swail (five 
goals) had the Maryland keeper see-
iog stars all game long. 

Host Michigan played round-two 
victim, falling 10-3 to another Tri-
ton slaying. Swail rammed home 
six goals in the winning effort, and 
Mason amassed six saves. 

In a hotly-contested third ses-
sion matchup, it took a late three-
goal rally in the fourth quarter for 
UCSD to overcome the always dan-
gerous UC Davis Aggies, 7-4. 

Davis evened the score at three 
in the third period, but the Tritons 
craolted up the defense and Rost 
nailed three goals to certify the win. 

In Saturday's final round both 
Slippery Rock and UCSD overcame 
furious last-ditch attempts from' 
SDSU and UC Davis, respectively, 
to qualify for Sunday's final. 

The Rock barely edged the Az-
tees, 8-6, in one of the most exciting 
matches of the tournament, while 
UCSD once again had its hands full 
with tbe Aggies. 

But when the going got tough, 
the Tritons' defense transformed into 
a brick wall, stopping nearly all of 
Davis' offensive attacks when it 
counted most. In the end, UCSD 
prevailed 11-10 to advance to the 
finals.

Too Much 
Basketbrawl 1994 USA COLLEGIATE NATIONAL WOMEN 'S WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIPS 

Is it just me or is the NBA 
beginning to resemble the 
National Basketbrawl Associa-
tion ? Now that the playoffs are 
in full swing and the stakes 
have been raised, there is a 
super-testosterone insurgence 
on the court. Players seem to 
taunt one another after every 
big play. Usually it doesn' t go 
over well with the player on 
the receiving end of a big-time 
rejection when he has to listen 
to his opponent scream into his 
face, "get that @!#* out of my 
house!" 

Friday night's ballgame 
between the New York 
Knickerbrawlers and the 
Chicago Bulls is the most 
recent example. In the second 
quarter, the Knicks' Derek 
Harper exchanged insults and 
then punches with the Bulls' 10 
10 English before slamming 
him to the ground at the feet of 
front row fans in the Chicago 
Stadium. 

The ensuing bench-clearing 
melee managed to pour over 
into the second row as fans 
formed a tight circle around the 
combatants to cheer on their 
favorite boxer, er, I mean ball 
player.

Ironically, the incident 
occurred just one row in front 
of esteemed NBA commis-
sioner Donald Stem who, no 
doubt, spent hours reviewing 
the tapes afterward. The 
NBA's verdict was surprisingly 
stem: Harper received a two-
game suspension and a fine 
while English was hit with a 
one-game suspension and a 
fine.

NCAA NATIONAL 'IIILIIT: Tritons defeat Slippery Rock, AK, 6-5, to capture the 
USA Collegiate women's water polo National Championship in Ann Arbor, MI 
By BrIM K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Pe~aps the annual USA Colle-
giate women's water polo National 
Championships should be renamed 
simply the Triton Cup. UCSD (28-
2) has rarely shared its yearly prize 
with outsiders. 

"We start out every season know-
ing exactly what we want to accom-

plish," Triton Head Coach Denny 
Harper said. "We have never trained 
for second-best here and it usually 
shows at the end of the season." 

Indeed. Harper certainly wasn't 
playing second fiddle in the 1994 
rendition hosted by the University 
of Michigan in Ann Arbor last week-
end. His UCSD banner-bearingjug-
gernaut kept on chugging yesterday 

after the Tritons· 6-5 squeaker over 
Slippery Rock, AK, in the 
toumaJllCnt's championship final. 
It was UCSO's fourth national title 
in the last five years. 

UCSO may have had a little more 
incentive for this one, however, af-
ter it was slighted by the tourna-
ment-rankings committee, which 

See POLO, Page 22 

One question that immedi-
ately comes to my mind when I 
witness such incidents is why 
these men are seemingly above 
the law of not only the NBA 
but the system of justice we 
live under. If such an incident 
were to occur in say, a bar with 
' real people,' a large group of 
them would be hauled down to 
the station and charged with 
something along the lines of 
disturbing the peace or assault 
and battery . Yet we stand and 
scream madly as pro players 
attempt to beat the life out of 
each other. 

Baseball Hosts NCAA Regionals WHAT'S INSIDE 

The question that remains is 
why NBA competitors can't 
simply play ball without all the 
trash- talking and posturing 
that eventually leads to such 
shameful incidents? Why can't a

I WOMEN ' S TENNIS 1994 NCAA CHAMPIONS 

NMJN8 ALL ACES 
Triton's top-seeded sin,les 
player Diane Chandler 
helped UCSD upset top-
ranked Trinity, TX on the 
fOld to its fourth NCAA Di-
vision III Team National 
Championship. 

Julie SwaU capped off a storybook women's water polo 
season by guiding the Tritons' talented squad (28-2) to its fourth 
USA Collegiate National Championship in the last five yem. 

The All-American two-meter superstar continually forced 
UCSO's overwhelmed opponents to drop back on her in the hole, 
yet the sophomore still managed to net 13 pis over the coune 
of the 1994 tournament. 

"She is without a doubt the best player in the country ri,ht 
now," Head Coach Denny Harper said.
