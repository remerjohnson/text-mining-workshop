Connerly Targets 
Affirmative Action 
SAN DIEGO - Reaffirming 
his oppostion to affirmative 
action programs, UC Regent 
Ward Connerly said on 
Sunday 's "This Week with 
David Brinkley" that, though 
some affirmative action 
policies should continue, racial 
preferences in the student 
application process should 
end. "It is stigmatizing many 
that are considered to be 
products of affirmative action. 
I just believe that the liabilities 
now outweigh the benefits to a 
very great extent," he said. 
"When we give preferential 
treatment we are almost by 
definition discriminating 
against something." Elizabeth 
Toledo, spokeswoman for the 
National Organization for 
Women's California chapter, 
also appeared on the show and 
argued in favor of affirmative 
action.

UCSD Seho .. SUSpect in Assassination 
CRIME: Guest lecturer 
arrested for murder of 
Mexican leader 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

The Center for U.S.-Mexican 
Studies at UCSD was playing host 
to the brother of former Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
last year while he was allegedly 
plotting the assassination of a senior 

official of the Mexican governing 
party. 

Raul Salinas de Gortari, the 
former president's older brother, was 
arrested Tuesday in MtIIIico City on 
charges of ordering and paying for 
the Sept. 28 assassination of Jose 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, second in 
command of the Institutional Revo-
lutionary Party (PRI). 

Salinas was a guest scholar at the 
UCSD research center during the 
time when the Mexican Federal At-

COOKIN' IT UP 

torney General's Office alleged he 
was plotting the assassination. 

According to Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies Director Kevin 
Middlebrook, Salinas was at UCSD 
conducting research on reform of 
the Mexican ejidocommunal-farm-
ing system from October 1992 to 
September 1993. Special prosecu-
tor Pablo Chapa Bezanilla said at a 
press conference that Salinas began 
planning the assassination in March 
1993. 

Middlebrook said Salinas was 
not on campus very often because 
of his research in the Carmarca 
Lagunera region of Mexico, in the 
eastern state of Caohuila. "He did 
do a lot of traveling and he worked 
at home much of the time ," 
Middlebrook said. 

Salinas gave a seminar in June 
1993 and published a short study 
with a fellow researcher, entitled, 
"Rural Reform in Mexico: The View

Rethinking California'. 
Faltering Master Plan 

By Doug Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

B acked to the wall by five years of devastat-ing budget cuts, California's public univer-sities are retreating from their historic prom-
ise to provide re idents with low-cost education. 
The Master Plan, which has served as a blueprint of 
California's commitment to higher education since 
1960, is collapsing, observers warn. In April 1993, 
the Assembly Committee for Higher Education 
wrote, "The convent of the Master Plan is being 
undone." 

Fees at the University of California, California 
State University and the California Community 
Colleges have skyrocketed since 1990, and finan-
cial aid has been unable to keep pace. According to 
critic, the e "high fee, low aid" policies have barred 
a significant number of would-be students from the 
ivory tower. California, once sporting high post-
secondary enrollment growth, is now ranks eight 
percent below the national average. 

Chuck Nguyen/ Guardian 
Charles KIm from SIgma Chi fraternity dishes up a bowl of chill durIng the Greek 
Week Red Hot Chili Bash, yesterday at the Price Center. 

But the worst may be yet to come. Education 
analysts warn that California 's systems of higher 
education have an even na tier road ahead of them. 
Though the state's economy may boom again, 
critics say it is unlikely that economic growth alone 
will be sufficient to fuel higher education in the 
21st century. The Golden Age of education, they 
say, is unequivocally over.

Davis' Controversial Nomination Supported by Peltason 
ALUMNI: UeSD 
graduate accused of 
being racist 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Controversy continues to plagu~ 
the academic career of UC Santa 
Cruz Professor Angela Davis, a 
former Black Panther and Commu-
nist Party leader who was appoi,nted' 
last month to the University of 
California's Presidential Chair. 

Her appointment was challenged 
, by California Sen. Bill Leonard, R-

San Bernadino, who wiote a letter 
of protest to UC President Jack 
Peltason on Feb. 8. Calling Davis a 
racist and anti-Semite, the chairman 
of the Senate Republican Caucus 
said he intends to ' raise the issue at 
the UC Board of Regents meeting in 
March. 
. "It reminds Americans of 
California's flaky pastata tim~when 
we're trying to build up our reputa-
tion," Leonard stated in the letter. 

"The entire integrity of the system is 
on the line when it appoints some-
one with Ms. Davis ' reputation for 
racism, violence and communism." 

In,a Jetter sent to Leonard last 
Friday, P.eltason refused to recon-. 
sider the appointment. "I would have 
no reason for revoking my decision 
other tha.n th.e fact that the appoint-
ment is, for some, a controversial 
one " he stated. 

Faculty in the History of Con-
Â·sciousness Department and the Hu-
manities Division of UC Santa Cruz 

stated in a press release that Davis ' 
appointment has been "grossly mis-
represented. " 

Without mentioning Leonard by 
name, they wrote that critics of 
Davis ' appointment are ignorant of 
her work. "Far from encouraging 
divisi.on among ethnic and racial 
groups, she is internationally known 
for her effort to bui Id bridge across 
them and to Mercome racial, eth-
nic, and national antagoni. ms."

Atkinson and a gi-

famous cal. His wife, Audrey Stone 
Geisel, will also attend the celebra-
tion which will commemorate her 
husband 's life and work. 

Dr. Seuss was widely recognized 
for such literary staples of Ameri-
can childhood as The Cat in the Hal 
series and his holiday favorite, How 
the Grinch Stole Christmas. Dr. 
Seuss also attempted to teach chil-
dren about social issues while enter-
taining them with such books as The 
Butter Battle Book which had a 
distinctly anti-war message and his 
environmentally conscious book, 
The Lorax. 

A recipient of honorary degrees 
from Princeton, Brown and 
Dartmouth, which was his under-
graduate alma mater, as well as the 
National Education Association 
Lifetime Learning Achievement 
award, Dr. Seuss was one of the 
most recognized children's authors 
of his time. 

Dr. Seuss originally came to La 
Jolla for getaway weekends from 
his hectic life in Hollywood accord-
ing to his wife. "He finally realized 

Gerry Lowell, the head librarian," 
said Mrs. Geisel. 

The collection items are housed 
in the Special Collections Depari Â· 
ment in the west wing of the main 
floor of the University Library. "It 
is available to researchers and cer-
tain items can be loaned to institu-
tions for exhibition," said 
Mandeville Department of Special 
Collections Head Lynda Claassen. 

Atthe 1978 commencement cer-
emony for Revelle College, Dr. 
Seuss concluded his poem-like 
speech with, "I just wish you good 
luck! and a Hasta Luego/ from UC 
La Jolla ... / .. .I mean San Diego." 

According to Mrs. Geisel, her 
husband would have wished UCSD 
students to see him as "a very ongo-
ing man whose [timeless] reality 
has started with their grandparents 
and their parents, and this reality 
will come out when the student de-
livers a student of their own. 

"He just wanted to leave his lit-
erary footprints behind and wanted 
them to be deep enough, so that 
people could follow those foot-
prints," she added.

Winter Fest to Host Untouchables SUSPECT: 
Plans for crime 
made at UCSD EVENT: First mini 

Mardi Gras supported 
by $20,000 budget 
By Ivan Dew.nth.l 
Senior Staff Writer 

Stilt-walkers, palm readers , 
psychics' and others will join the 
"mini" Mardi Gras celebration on 
the Price Center walkway Friday, in 
UCSD's first annual Winter Fest. 

The ASUCSD Winter Fest '95, 
which is free to all students, will be 
held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. tomor-
row. The carnival will be followed 
by a TGIf featuring The Untouch-
ables, starting at 5:30 p.m. in the 
Price Center Plaza 

" I'm really excited that we are 
establishing a festival with a Mardi 
Gras theme," s ... :d A.S. President 
Carla Tesak. 

"We are hoping it can become an 
annual tradition like the Sun God

voked an angry response from the 
California Black Legislative Cau-
cus, which said he was threatening 
academic freedom by making the 
appointment a political issue. 

"for the past 14 years, Califor-
nians have trusted the UC president 
to utilize his judgment in making 
appointments based on scholastic 
achievement and peer recommen-
dations, not political pressure," said 
Assemblywoman Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles) 
who chairs the Assembly Commit-

festival," added Tesak. 
Daytime festivities will include 

the band The Rugburns, which will 
play at noon, tarot-card readers, ice 
sculpting, ticket giveaways, 
rollerblading, mask-making and a 
velcro wall. A float parade will be-
gin at 4 p.m. in front of the Career 
Services Center. Cajun-style food 
will also be sold during the carnival. 

"There will be so much going on 
that we have never had before," said 
Winter fest Chairperson Cecelia 
Lucero. 

The budget for Winter fest '95 is 
$20,000, comparable to the amount 
allotted for the annual Sun God fes-
tival. The Sun God festival has raised 
an additional $10,000 from corpo-
rate sponsors. . 

Despite its budget, the A.S. pro-
gram m ing com mittee had a difficult 
time booking bands for Winter fest. 
Many bands prefer touring during 
the spring and summer, when the 

tee Higher Education. "Now, when 
an African-American womanof An-
gela Da vis 'sconsiderable stature and 
scholastic accomplishments is 
awarded a chair on the basis of her 
academic excellence, the conserva-
tive, intolerant right wing cries foul. " 

Davis was unavailable for com-
ment. 

This is not the first time that 
Davis, a former UCSD philosophy 
graduate student and doctoral canÂ· 
didate, has been in the center of 
controversy. She made the FBI 's 
"10 Most Wanted List" in 1970, 
following a shooting at the Marin 
County Courthouse which killed 

weathtr is more favorable for open-
ai r concerts. 

"It was very frustrating," said 
Assistant Director of Student Gov-
ernment Services Randy Woodard. 
Woodard said that bands Toad the 
Wet Sprocket, Primus, Gin Blos-
soms and Collective Soul all de-
clined the A.S. bids. 

"It was either The Untouchables 
or nobody," said Lucero, who 
changed the date of the carnival 
twice in hopes that another band 
could be found. Lucero has been in 
charge of the Sun God festival for 
the last two years. 

Whereas a typical Sun God Fes-
tival band earns roughly $17,000, 
The Untouchables will receive be-
tween $10,000 and $12,000 for their 
performance. The rest of the money, 
according to programming officials, 
will be used to fund the daytime 
activities. 

Originally a beer garden was to 

four people with guns she had pur-
chased. Davis was later acquitted in 
the kidnapping, murder and con-
spiracy trial in which she served as 
her own counsel. 

After discovering her affiliation 
with the Communist Party in 1969, 
Gov. Ronald Reagan and the UC 
Board of Regents won a year-long 
campaign to fire Davis, who later 
ran for vice president on the Com-
munistParty ticket in 1980and 1984. 
In the much-publicized battle, 
UCLA Chancellor Charles Young 
refused to fire her, and professors 
and stutlents protested. 

The Presidential Chair carries a 

be installed on the Price Center Lawn, 
but Winter fest programmers were 
unable to obtain a liquor license from 
the Alcoholic Beverage Control de-
partment (ABq. 

"The university doesn ' t have the 
best reputation with ABC," said 
Woodard, who added that 60 percent 
of UCSD undergraduates are under 
21 . Woodard said he is not optimistic 
the A.S. will be able to get the license 
for future Winter fests . 

Winter fest '95 has not received 
considerable publicity because the 
printing of posters advertising the 
event was delayed. 

"I 'm worried students don 't know 
about the event," Tesak said, "But 
things like this get stronger as the 
years go on." 

Winter fest '95 is occurring in 
conjunction with the 'Spring Break 
On-Campu3 Tour', which will take 
place March 2 and 3 at the Price 
Center. 

$75,000 stipend for use in developing 
innovative teaching programs. Davis, 
whose term began in January, plans to 
use her three-year appointment to cre-
ate the Research Cluster on Women 
of Color in Collaboration and Con-
flict and to' develop new ethnic-stud-
ies courses. She will also work with 
faculty at UC Santa Barbara to de-
velop a doctoral program in African-
American studies. 

Davis has written several articles 
and books, including Women, Cul-
ture, and Politics, in 1988; Women, 
Race, and Class, in 1982; and an 
autobiography, in 1974. She has re-
cently completed another book. 

Continued from pas. 1 
from the Comarca Lagunera in 
1993," based upon oral tradiÂ· 
tions he had collected. 

Ruiz Massieu's murder was 
the second assassination of a 
party leader in 1994. Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, next in line 
to succeed President Salinas 
for the PRI candidacy, was 
killed at a campaign rally in 
March. 

According to Chapa, Sali-
nas planned the assassination 
with ruling-party legislator 
Manuel Munoz Rocha, a fugi-
tive who was charged last fall 
for the murder. He said the two 
attempted to have Ruiz Massieu 
killed twice before. 

Salinas released a statement 
in which he denied having any 
relationship with Munoz 
Rocha. 

However, accord i ng to 
Chapa, Munoz Rocha tele-
phoned Salinas in Mexico the 
day after the assassination. 
Seven witnesses, including 
Munoz Rocha 's private secre-
tary, testified that the two men 
had a close relationship, Chapa 
said. 

According to some specuÂ· 
lators, the assassins' motivaÂ· 
tions for killing Ruiz Massieu 
could have been the legislator's 
democratic views. Salinas was 
also widely suspected of abus-
ing posts which he held under 
his brother's governance.

The U.S. Embargo Against 
Cuba Is a Futile Obsession 

The United States has had a long love affair with the 
idea that an economic embargo will bring about Fidel 
Castro's demise. One would think after 33 years of 
failure, Washington politicians would see the embargo 
against Cuba as a futile obsession. Recently, however, 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse 
Helms introduced a bill which would tighten the embargo. 
This initiative would not only renew the offensively 
imperialistic measures of the embargo, but would also 
alienate U.S. allies and hurt American business opportuni-
ties. 

Helms seems to feel his initiative, which would punish 
foreign countries who do business with Cuba, would 
finally break Castro: "Let me be clear .... Whether Castro 
leaves Cuba in a vertical or horizontal position is up to 
him and the Cuban people. But he must and will leave 
Cuba." 

However, it is unlikely that a senator from South 
Carolina, or the entire U.S. government, will scare Castro 
out of his own country. Castro has proved himself to be a 
strong contender in the face of tougher challenges than the 
current embargo. He has managed to not only rally against 
U.S. opposition time and again, but he has also survived 
the fall of communism. Since the late 1980s and early 
1990s, when communism and the Soviet Union - Cuba's 
main economic backer - crumbled, he refused to faJl by 
the wayside. 

Although Cuba has experienced a major economic 
crisis, Castro has tried to adapt to a world where capital-
ism reigns. He has opened up trade with Canadian, Mexi-
can and European businesspeople, bringing in telecommu-
nications, oil exploration and mining. In December of 
1994, Cuba had signed deals for 185 joint ventures with 
foreign investors. 

The renewed embargo would allow Americans whose 
property was expropriated by Cuba to sue any foreign 
companies which currently own it; it would deny 
U.S. visas to company officers and shareholders; and it 
would restrict American banks from making loans to these 
companies. 

However, the tightening of the embargo fails to take 
into account several factors which prove the utter useless-
ness of Helms' bill. 

Although Cuba's economy may be weak, Castro has 
taken steps to ensure that he will not be deposed, at least 
by his own people. His recent reforms - such as legaliz-
ing trade in dollars, opening up opportunities for self-
employment and allowing farmers to sell their food in the 
open markets - have spurred economic growth and 
increased Castro's popularity among Cubans. Dissident 
Cubans may ideologically oppose Castro, yet most agree 
it would be easier to escape to the United States than to 
overthrow him. 

Furthermore, by restricting trade with Cuba, the U.S. 
government is inflicting damage upon its own economy. 
Foreign firms see the embargo as the chance to do busi-
ness without U.S. competition. American economists 
estimate that if the embargo were lifted, U. S. business 
could total as much as $1 billion in the first year. 

Finally, Helms' bill would considerably damage 
relations between the United States and Cuba's investors. 
Even the U.N. General Assembly voted 101 to 2 with the 
United States and Israel dissenting, to end the embargo. 
Gary Jannin, the head of the new U.S.-Cuba Foundation, 
believes that Helms' new take on the embargo "will only 
help Castro score anti-American propaganda points." 

The U.S. government is not only employing aggres-
sive tactics against Cuba, it is also ensuring its own 
economic setbacks. The Clinton administration and House 
Republicans should heed the advice of Jarmin, who argues 
that "a massive infusion of capital and contacts will have 
tbe best chance of encouraging refonn." While Castro's 
rule may be contemptible, the United States' 33-year 
campaign to derail Cuba is equaUy subject to scorn.

STARSHIP CENTRAL LmRARY: 
MISSION ABORTED 

COMMENTARY: Bow down before the gods of the library - the 
. keepers of the secrets - or be forever doomed to ignorance 

BRENT 

J0JH150n 
Smells Like 
The Truth 

The birds are singing, the 
sun is shining - it's another 
beautiful weekend morning 
at UCSD. Taking your Rai-
sin Bran and cranberry juice 
out onto your balcony, the 
nearly empty beach and 
waves beckon you. I should 
go and enjoy myself for 
once, you think. I should 
have a life. 

But the memory of your 
joyous 
childhood 
quickly 
passes; it's 
time to get 
down and 

dirty with a little research at the 
crown jewel of the UCSD campus-
The Federation Starship Central li-
brary. 

. 

"LO," the gods answer, "THIS rs THY LIST OF 
READING RESOURCES. GO FORTH AND BE 
LEARNED." 

Thinking you might find something interesting 
about education in an article about Japanese suicides, 
you jot down all the information needed to locate it. 
Mter an hour of searching, you find it in the huge, 
dusty collection of books on the "to be returned" cart. 
Feverishly turning through the pages, searching for that 
all-elusive article, which probably won 't help you in 
your research anyway, you find nothing. Absolutely 
nothing. 

You decide to double check with the 
gods. 

"LO," announce the guardians of 
the secrets, "THIS IS THE LOCA-
TION OF THY ARTICLE. GO 
FORTH AND BE LEARNED." 

rf the library were more like a li-
bnry than a spaceship, perhaps stu-
dents you could find the information 
you need. II's a wonder that the uni-
versity calls the Central Library a li-
brary at all (but then again, when you 
compare it to the Undergraduate li-
brary, or "UGLy," UCSD's version of 
a good time, you stop asking ques-
tions. I think the administrators 
planned it that way). 

Let's suppose you want to do up-
tooodate research on, oh, I don't know, 
the state of education in the United 
States as compared to that of foreign 
nations. You do your duty and pray 

'Have you 
prayed to the 
godsottlle 
library?' 'Of 
course I've 
prayed.' 'Yes, 
but did you 
pray really 
hard?' 

A quick comparison of the bound 
articles with the announcement re-
veals you weren't mistaken - your 
article should be in this volume. 
You're about to cry, but then, hope 
arises - you've spotted the informa-
tion desk. 

And just as quickly, all hope is 
dashed. "Hmm," considers the master 
librarian, eyeing you suspiciously. 
"Have you prayed to the gods of the 
library?" 

"Of course I've prayed." 
"Yes. but did you pray really hard?" 
Exasperated, you leave and try to 

locate: an article about the Great 
Argentinean Potato Disaster, which, 
surprisingly, is in the Tunes EdMcation 
Supplement (Sept 9, 1994): 12, L 16 

to the electric gods of the library - the terminals 
which access Melvyl and Roger. Intimidated, you 
type, "F SU STATE OF EDUCATION IN THE U.S. 
AS COMPARED TO THAT OF FOREIGN NA-
TIONS." 

"LO," the terminal replies, "ZERO CITATIONS IN 
THE DATABASE. TRY AGAIN, MORTAL" 

After trying 23 times to find anything at all, you 
can only find articles which pertain to either the Great 
AlJcntincan Potato Disaster or suicide rates of Japa-
nese high school students. 

T6 Current Shelves Bound In Staclcs. 
Not surprisi ngly, the Tunes EdllCation Supplement and 
L 16 T6 aren't there. 

"Well," the master librarian announces, "the bound 
stacks do circulate, as you are aware." 

"You're telling me that the entire bound collection 
of the ~s EdMcatiofl Supplement is being used right 
now?" 

"The bound stacks do circulate. But try the current 
editions. "

might have otherwise, it also makes them cringe with fear by the mere though of attending a lecture

LInD-
Jaundiced I 

over the somnolent 
ranks of an under-
graduate history 
class I attend, I 
longingly recall 
what I now realize 
were my blissful 
college years. At-
tending lectures 
meant taking copi-
ous notes punctu-
ated by the occa-
sional snooze or 
whispered ex-
change with a class-
mate. But due to the 

bizarre educational experiment being inflicted 
on me at the Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies (I RIPS), those 
days are gone. During the orientation, pro-
fessors informed us about their use of "cold 
calls" - that is, calling on students at ran-
dom from the roll sheet to answer questions 
about the reading and the subject of discus-
sion. My first realization (after "hey, they 
never mentioned this in the brochure") was 
that everything we say - or don't say - in 
class can and will be used against us. Re-
sponses to cold calls count toward our class 
participation grade. 

Continuing with the 
lecture, the professor 
moves to the "safe" area 
of the room - namely, far 
from the roll sheet on the 
podium - where, as long 
as she stays there, students 
can relax and raise hands 
to volunteer answers. But 
as soon as the professor 
realizes she has been par-
ticipating in a discussion 
with willing participants 
for far too long, back to 
the podium she will sud-
denly stride. Tensed 
shoulders spread a ripple

are those who not only 
didn 't do the reading, but 
aren 't paying attention or 
aren't even going to class. 
Risky. Very risky. 

Students end up em-
ploying various strategies 
with cold calls. Here are 
some: 

â¢ The Overachiever: 
He doesn ' t mind cold 
calls a nd he enjoys the 
chance to share his opin-
ions. He knows all the 
answers anyway, so being 
called on makes no differ-
ence. 

â¢ The Unlucky: Ev-
erybody knows he always 
does the reading, but he 
gets caught with an ob-

A typical class proceeds as follows. The 
professor speaks for a few moments, and the 
students begin taking notes. Then she will say, 
" ... which brings us to the piece I asked you to 
read about .... " Pens freeze in mid-sentence as 
the professor peers down at the roll sheet on 
the podium, her eyes scanning the list in what 
must be the longest pause in the history of 
ti me. "M ichael X," she'll say, and the rest of 

across the rows of the lec- 'Jenny L' 
ture hall. Her eyes will run 
down the list in that tormenting pause, and 
then she will call- "Jenny L." 

With cold calls, as with anything, 
Murphy's Law reigns true. One could have 
spent four hours outlining the reading, thought 
of every possible angle from which questions 
will be asked, and the question which is asked 
will be unrelated to the reading and part of 
some obscure argument which the professor 
has just introduced. If a student totally ne-

scure question which he doesn't know how 
to answer. He does his best and wins points 
for courage. 

â¢ The Comedian: Regardless of whether 
or not he prepared for class, he doesn't un-
derstand the question. He makes a witty com-
ment which sends the students howling but 
leaves the professor onty mildly amused -
and the question unanswered. A dangerous 
strategy in IRIPS, because political scientists 

regard humor as a cover-up for a lack of ideas 
- which, in this case, it is. This wins style 
points only. 

â¢ The Forthright: He doesn 't know, and 
says, "I don ' t know." This wins honesty points 
and finally-someone-who-doesn 't-BS points 
with both students and professor. 

Professors assure us that cold calling is a 
mild tactic employed to encourage students 
to prepare for class, and form and voice opin-
ions. If they had meant it as a gentle impetus, 
they would never use the term "cold" call, 
which conjures up images of "cold cocked" 
or "cold feet. " Or perhaps "cold day in hell," 
which might accurately predict when I'll be 
able to respond coherently to being called on. 

Given the "warm" educational trends of 
the day (calling teachers "facilitators" and so 
on) I find the cold call a dubious German 
military school-scare tactic amidst UCSD 
modernity. Though it seems motivation by 
fear has long been accepted as an inferior edu-
cational strategy, IRiPS apparently believes 
the pros (encouraging preparation and opin-
ion forming) outweigh the cons (the looming 
threat of public humiliation before your peers 
and professor). 

To be fair, r must admit that my prepara-
tion for these lectures is more thorough than 
it would be without cold calling. We even go 
so far to meet before class to discuss readings 
- something 1 seriously doubt we would do 
if all calls were warm. 

How effective would a "warm call" be? 
The professor would ask the class, "Does any-
one have anything to say about the reading?" 
Encouraging smile. "Or, if you don't have 
anything to say about the reading, does any-
one have anything to say about anything 
else?" Maybe IRIPS has a point.

The predictions are grim. Ac-
cording to numerous analysIS and 
think tanks, California's public uni-
versities will be hit by a massive 
increase of new students in the next 
century. Dubbed "Tidal Wave 11," 
an estimated 450,000 additional 
college students are scheduled to 
flood California's universities by 
the year 2004. 
While this would 
be difficult to cope 
with during the 
best of times, ana-
lyst say this "tidal 
wave" will be ac-

massive funding 
shortfalls.

Harvard Professor David

California," contends university and 
government leaders have failed to 
address the long-term problems fac-
ing the state's universities.

for the chal-
lenges of the next 

higher education. 
"Generally, we're going to have 

to accommodate hundreds of thou-
sands of new students, and right 
now we don't have the resources," 
said Assembly Committee for 
Higher Education Senior Consult-
ant Andy Shaw. "There's clearly a

lature and the governor attempt to

It.te of the Debllte 

Though some may quibble with 
the specifics of the doomsday pre-
dictions, virtually everyone work-
ing in higher education agrees the 
state's public universities are facing 
a crisis of monumental proportions. 
This somber fact has raised the stakes 
of the ongoing debate about higher 
education, and policy analysts say 
long-range planning - a fundamen-
tal rethinking of the goals and strat-
egies of delivering education - are 
essential to the continued viability 
of the state's universities. 

"The status quo will not bold," 
said CPEC Senior Analyst Daniel 
Parker said. "And I think that under 
the scenario if nothing is done or if 
there are only changes on the mar-
gin, if everyone sort ofbunkers down 
as if to weather this 'tidal wave,' 

decade. "Ifwe're 
going to see any changes, they won't 
come until external pressures [force 
them)," Finney said. 

However, according to UC Of-
fice of the President Spokesman 
Mike Alva, "There is a sense from 
(Breneman] that nothing is being 
done to accommodate the increase 
in students, and this is wrong." He 
added, "The state knows these pro-
jections .. . and the goal is to accom-
modate as many students as pos-
sible .... " 

Professor Sheldon Rothblatt, di-
rector of UC Berkeley's Center for 
Studies in Higher Education, said 
the universities are continuously 
planning, but added that forging a 
broad, long-range plan, especially 
for institutions as "bottom heavy" 
and complex as the University of 
California, is extraordinarily diffi-
cult. 

"We [the UC) arc not one com-
munity, we're a conglomerate of 
3,000 different segments, each with 
their own histories, each with their 
own networks and so on," he said. 
"It's very difficult to get a handle on 
this one, very diffICUlt to do it .... ," 
Rotbblatt added. 

AJthough debate about prcserv-
in,quality andaccea in higheredu-

cation has been ongoing, neither the 
state nor the universities have de-
veloped broad, long-term plans for 
coping with the economic and de-
mographic realities of tomorrow. In 
the last two months, however, 
CHEPC and CPEC have narrowed 
the gap: They have each released 
blueprints for moving higher educa-
tion - and if not the letter, the spirit 
of the Master Plan - into the 21st 
century. 
Blueprints for .... Future 

Calling on Gov. Pete Wilson to 
declare "a state of emergency of 
infinite duration" in higher educa-
tion, Breneman laid out 12 recom-
mendations to keep the state's uni-
versities afloat. "Most of these ac-
tions will have a cost for some par-
ticipants in the system," Breneman 
admitted, "but each involves a bal-
ancing of those costs against the 
greater social good." 

Breneman's most controversial 
proposals - those Â·which pushed 
him onto the front pages of 
California's dailies - include his 
call to give enrollment priority to 
17- to 24-year-olds and to freeze 
enrollment in master's programs at 
all CSUs and doctoral programs at 
five UCs-Santa Cruz,Davis, Santa 
Barbara, Riverside and Irvine. 

Although the UC and CSU have 
not officially responded to these pro-
posals, at the UC Board of Regents 

.meeting at 
UCSD ' two 

Emergency?" Both recommend ex-
panding private college enrollment 
by increasing financial aid, explor-
ing new educational technologies, 
finding ways of getting students out 
of college faster and linking state 
funding to enrollment figures. 

The proposals to tie higher edu-
cation funding to enrollment figures 
represent a call to t he state to re-
commit to the faltering Master Plan. 
Now, the state simply commits 
"block grants" to the three systems, 
regardless of actual enrollment or 
demand. Under the CPEC proposal, 
if the state is unable to pay for total 
enrollment, "it must explicitly state 
the level of enrollment it is willing 
to support - and consequently, the 
level of rationing .... " 

Student fees, of course, have been 
the most contentious issue in higher 
education in the '90s. According to 
Breneman and CPEC, the Master 
Plan's traditional promise of pro-
vidinga low-cost education toquali-
fied citizens regardless of their fi-
nancial status is flawed in an era of 
such limited resources. "Many stu-
dents in the UC system come from 
relatively wealthy fam i I ies, and there 
is no economic reason for these stu-
dents to conti nue to receive the high 
level of subsidy currently provided," 
he wrote. Breneman suggests tying 
fees to the median household in-
come within each system. 

The CPEC re-
port similarly pro-
poses basing fees 
on a set percentage 
of instruction cost. 
The UC, for ex-
ample, would beset 
at40percent, while 
CSU would be set 
at 30 percent. U n-
der this plan, fee 
hikes would be 
based either on in-
creases in the cost 
of instruction or 
changes in per-
capita income.

Provost Walter 
Massey sharply 
criticized 
Breneman's rec-
ommendation to 
freeze doctoral 
enrollment, say-
ingsuch a policy 
would be a 
"grave mistake." 
According to 
Massey, gradu-
ate students are 
crucial to the 
economy, fuel-
ing innovation 
and competitive-
ness in Califor-
nia industry.

he added_ 

Though CPEC has not proposed

there are several similarities between

Rothblalt stands out as a dissent-
in, voice in this debale_ The Iong-

Thursday, March 2, 1995 

contends, is primarily a threat to 
research and graduate programs, not 
undergraduate education. 

"Most people arguing about the

cess in the broadest terms. I'd like to 
shift that discussion and say that if 
we don't provide access in conven-
tional terms, we can provide it in 
other terms. Conceiving new ways 
of delivering education on the 
cheap," he said. . 

Pointing to computer-based 
learning and different forms oflong-
distance education, Rothblatt said 
new and existing technologies will 
enable universities to provide un-
dergraduate education to a great 
number at a lowercosl. The Internet, 
or its hoped-for predecessor, the so-
call Information Superhighway, 
could be central to the education of 
the 21st century, say adherents such 
as Rothblatt . 

Most high-level education and 
rescarch, howevcr, cannol be ab-
sorbed by these new forms of edu-
cational technology, according to 
Rothblatt. "The question [in this 
crisis] is the preservation of certain 
costly functions, which are not eas-
ily duplicated and upon which our 
society has come to rest," he added. 

According to CPEC, the costs of 
implemenlingsuch technologies will 
be prohibitive in the short term -
campus infrastructure, hardware and 
software, and student and faculty 
training represent a huge investment. 
In the long term, however, CPEC 
claims such technology could be 
highly beneficial to California, 
stretching fewer resources to more 
people. 

Breneman is not as convinced 
aboutthe benefits of the virtual class-
room. " .. .I am not as optimistic as 
some about the potential cost sav-
ings to be found along the informa-
tion highway," he wrote. However, 
he added it would be irresponsible 
not to explore these technologies 
and how they might increase educa-
tional opportunities. 
More ThIIn Word. 

Although some of the recommen-
dations contained in the CPEC and 
CHEPC reports could stem the rising 
tide of catastrophe, they cannot be 
effective without the economic and 
political support of the state. Under 
any long-term plan for higher educa-
tion, California will inevitably need 
to make a reasonable commitment to 
higher education. 

"One of the big questions is, do 
we have the will to do that, as the 
people? Will we put higher 'educa-
tion in terms of importance on the 
same plane as building prisons?" 
Parker asked. 

Student Regent-elect Edward 
Gomez said, "I always like to take 
the optimistic point of view on hu-
mankind, thai is, if we work to-
gether to get rid of the crap that's 
being perpetuated, we can find It 
solution. But we have to have the 
idea that education is actually one of 
the only solutions, not that educa-
tion is one of the expendable solu-
tions .... "

OPINION 7 

SEARCH: 
Continued from .,..e 4 
west wing of the library. You ' ve 
experienced the horrors of the west 
wing before: the wait list for one 
of Ihe microfilm viewers, the torn 
periodicals shoved into tiny plas-
tic holders in no apparent tempo-
ral order, the lack of Mad Maga-
zine. 

You haven't prayed hard enough. 
You find the Times Education 
Supplement missing from the cur-
rent periodicals shelves. It simply 
doesn'l exist. 

Suddenly, these important is-
sues can wait, for the restroom de-
mands your attention. lillie did 
you know that the Central Library 
is often the scene of the most hor-
rendous gastric explosions in the 
history of modern civilization. You 
walk in and see one of the foulest 
spectacles ever to be combined 
with scent. The perpetrators must 
be eating some serious bran for a 
modern art project, because it 
looks so deliberate and so thought 
out, it can' t possibly be the pass-
ing whimsy of a bored sixth-year-
senior fratboy. Retching, you de-
cide to hold off your gastrointesti-
nal needs and quickly exit the bath-
room. 

When did the library stop be-
ing a library, you wonder as you 
leave it in desperate search for a 
decent toilet. Was it when the 
master librarians decided to stop 
ordering new books after 1989? 
Was it when they decided that it 
was okay to send out relatively re-

. cent magazines to be bound up, 
leaving students with no other 
means of oblaining those articles 
in the meantime? Or perhaps it 
was when they decided it was 
okay to charge JO cents per pho-
tocopy, when they charge only 
five cents at Pu Ise in the Price 
Cenler? 

For a major university library 
that appears ready to launch into 
the farthest reaches of academia, 
Central Library is slowly, but cer-
tainly, sinking into the mire of me-
diocrity. 

, . 

I believe tbat Jesus Christ 
is tbe Son of God.

Tritons Ground Grossmont 
WAR.wJP: The Tritons got little more than hitting practice vs. Grossmont 
&yD_S ... ..., 
Staff Writ!!r 

With two tough Division III op-
ponenls on the horizon in Pamona-
Pitzer College and Emory Univer-

sity of Georgia, 
the UCSD 
women's tennis 
team is looking 
for all the prac-
tice il can get 10 
be fully pre-
pared. 

Practice is ex-
actly what Ihe 
team received 
from Junior Col-

lege adversary Grossmonl College, 
whom it defeated convincingly, 9-

0, on Tuesday at the Spanos courts. 
Head Coach Liz laPlante appre-

ciated Ihe match, even though the 
Tritons were hardly pushed through-
out Ihe day. 
. "You always playa little harder 
against another school than against 
a teammate," laPlante said, accen-
tuating the ract Ihe match was prepa-
ration more than anything else. The 
contest had no bearing on UCSD's 
record, and technically was re-
garded as a scrimmage. 

The Tritons, playing wilhout 
Yumi Takemolo, set the tone wilh 
their typically slrong doubles play, 
sweeping alllhree matches in brisk 
fashion. 

Miki Kurokawa and Susan 

Drage continued to dominate atlheir 
top sPOI. The duo overwhelmed 
Grossmont's Carin Crawford and 
TlSh Hunnecut, 8-2. 

Michelle Malephansakul and 
Susan Huberman teamed up at Ihe 
second spot to oust Yuko Hayashi 
and Heather Romero, 8-4. 

Meanwhile, Morgan Gessford 
and Hilary Somers provided the 
exclamalion point, mercilessly 
bageling their hapless opponenls at 
the third slot, 8-0. 

Malephansakul seems to have 
completely recovered from the 
sprained ankle that sidelined her a 
few weeks ago. She outlasted hard-
hilling Hayashi 6-2, 7-6. 

The rest of Ihe Triton lineup, led 
by number-Iwo Somers's 
6-0, 6-3 defeat of 
Crawford, enjoyed even 
smoolher sailing. 

Third-seeded Drage 
overcame a slight quadri-
ceps pull that kept her out 
a few days last week to put 
away Hunnecut in a brief 
6-2, 6-2 trouncing ; 
Kurokawa siomped 
Romero wilh a dominaling 
6-1, 6-0 performance; 
Gessford pummeled Eden 
Looney 10 Ihe tune of a 6-
1,6-0 roul; and in the most 
lopsided contesl of the day, 
Huberman annihilated 
Kelly Gangwisch 6-0, 6-0. 

Suzy Drace conquered her opponents In .Inll.' and double. on Tuesday.

NIPPED: Tritons 
lose third to La Verne 
Continued from pce 12 

After that, the Tritons were held 
scoreless for Ihe next six innings. 
La Verne broke into the lead with a 
run in the fourth inning and then 
padded it with two in the seventh. 
Doen continually kept Ihe Triton 
bailers al bay with off-speed pilches 
and good location. 

"[Doen) Ihrew a good game, but 
he 's not a pitcher who should domi-
nate us," Coach Fletcher said. "We 
were just a little tight. We need some 
more consistent offense 10 back up 
the good pitching we're getting." 

The Tritons finally awoke in-the 
bottom of the eighth inning with two 
runs, closing the game 104-3. Pinch-
hitter Mark Mason walked, and 
Chris Miyake drove him in wilh a 
long triple 10 righi-center field . 
DelFavero then came through in the 
c1ulch once again with a deep fly 10 
lefl field, driving in his second run 
of the game. 

Craig Burke - representing Ihe 
tying run - came up with Iwo outs, 
but his bid for homerun number four 
was snagged down in the warning 
track of the centerfield wall. UCSD 
still had a shot in the ninth, but it 
wenl down one-two-three. 

"We gave them their first Iwo 
runs," Triton Head Coach Robert 
Fletcher said. "You can' l do that in 
any ballgame and expect to win." 

SNAPPED: 
Volleyball ends streak 
Continued from pce 12 
game-high five digs, while his coun-
terpart Black stymied the Leopards 
with Ihree service aces. 

La Verne, suiting up only seven 
players, never really got into the 
malch - due to shooling itself in 
the foot with error upon error. The 
Leopards only mustered a .076 al-
tack percentage in the three-game 
malch, compared to a .290 mark 
posled by the Trilons. 

Wilh one victory under ils belt, 
UCSD can now refocus its goals 
which begins Saturday night when 
Brigham Young University comes 
to lown. 

.. Although it is the team's first 
win, it's not the win we're looking 
for," Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
said. "We're striving for a confer-
ence win against a Div. I opponenl."

UCSD Spikes Losing Streak Pt. Lorna Pulls a 
Lazarus 

VICTORY: The Tritons 
crush La Verne in three sets 
to end their losing ways 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

With the midway point of the season 
rapidly approaching, the UCSD men 's vol-
leyball team was still on the hunt for that 

elusive first victory_ 
On Tuesday night, the 

hunt was over. The Tri-
tons got the perfect rem-
edy to Â·their early season 
woes - a visit to 
RIMAC by the winless 
La Verne Leopards (0-7). 

Not wanting to pass 
up the opportunity to get 
the "first win" monkey 
off its back, UCSD (1-

11) jumped all over its visitors from the 
north. The Tritons wasted little time in dis-
posing of a weak Leopard team, tallying 
an easy three-set total, 15-4, 15-7, 15-9. 

In fact, once the game began, the con-
test was never much in question - the Tri-
tons coasted the whole way, taking advan-
tage of numerous physical mismatches to 
virtually domi nate La Verne. 

UCSD also used the match as an op-
portunity to give its less-seasoned players 
some val uable game experience. The 
fres hl y shaved-head combo of Dan 
Thomassen and Ed McMaco'n led the Tri-
tons' offensive attack, as the duo combined 
for 18 kills in the match. 

Not to be outdone, bleached-blonde vet-
erans Tom Black and Tyson Kerr provided 
their usual strong play. Kerr racked up a 

STROKE: Crusaders 
rise up and defeat 
UCSD by one point 
By Tadd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

It was history in the making. 
Point Loma - perennial door-

mat of the golfing world - rose 
from the dead, de-
feating the UCSD 
golf team by a 
single stroke, 311-
310, last Monday. 

"This is the first 
time Point Loma 
has beaten us in 
anything," Triton 
Head Coach Mike 
Wydra said. " I bet 

they ' re still partying as we speak." 
The teams squared off at Rancho 

San Diego Golf Course, and theTri-
tons knew it was going to be a bad 
day from the moment they arrived. 
Due to a lineup mixup, UCSD was 
absent a key player. 

With only five men from which 
to draw their top-four scores instead 
of the usual six - and a squad al-
ready depleted by injuries - UCSD 
gave it the old college try against 
its local-area nemesis. 

"Pete [Roberts) is still injured. 

See SNAPPED, Page 11 Matt Mlnehan Iplke. through the La Verne defenle during UCSD'I three-set victory. 

He's going in for a MRI tomorrow," 
Wydra sa id . "We' re the walking 
wounded." 

Leopards Spot Tritons a Home Loss 
Jim O 'G rady and Arnie 

Campbell led the way for the em-
battled Tritons, tying for the top 
team spot with a pair of 76s. 

Brian Walters was in the third

BAnLE: La Verne wins the pitching duel,

hcal singer celebrates release of her debut album 

To say that San Diego-based singer Jewel has won over a local following would be an understatement. Although Jewel's debut Pieces of You only came out 
two days ago, her single "Who Will Save Your 
Soul" is already in heavy rotation on 91X, and 
tickets to her performances Ionight at the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan Theatre sold out minutes after 
going on sale. 

Jewel's challenge will be to win an audience 
in other parts of the country. But popular success 
should come easily for the 20-year-old, espe-
cially considering the strength of Pieces, an al-
bum which showcases her soaring vocals and 
surprisingly mature lyrics. 

In fact, Jewel has spent the last few 
weeks on the East Coast, playing at 
small bars and cafes not unlike the 
Innerchange Olffeehouse in Pa-
cific Beach where she at-

tracted a following of local fans last year. 
"I've been driving from Boslon 10 New York 

10 Washington, D.C., 10 Philadelphia to play 
clubsandcafes. It'slikeablinddateshow," Jewel 
said, during a recent phone interview from New 
York. "I go 10 every place the same time. It's 
working really well. By the third or fourth week, 
I have had 10 do two shows at each club a night 
because they are sold out. It's a very sincere way 
10 do something." 

Bom in Alaska, Jewel starting singing when 

she was six. She would follow her father as he 
played at various clubs. After rnovi ng from Alaska 
10 cities in the American South, she settled in San 
Diego and lived out of a Volkswagen Van for 
some time, surviving on tips from her coffee-
house shows. Jewel said that performing at an 
early age has helped her career. 

"My parents were singers. They put out al-
bums in the '70s. I sang with them in hotels. I 
started singing in bars when I was 8," she said_ 
"I've been writing about that experience a lot 
lately. I've started writing short slories about my 

life. I loved performing, but I remember 
that some guy came up to me when 

I was 12 and gave me a dime and 
said, 'Call mewhen you' re 16.'

Massive Attack 
Protection 

VI .... n Recorda 
Most post modem works attempt 

to soar mile-high in ingenuity and 
creativity by recycling already-used 
styles. The sad truth is that, at least in 
this neck of the woods, the majority of 
these endeavors fail miserably, as 
witnessed by the chi<hi pink hotel 
across from campus. An example of 
innovative postmodern art is the 
Bristol-based music group Massive 
Attack. 

The band's second album, Protec-
lion, has the mood of a good cigarette 
buzz: it's irreverently confident, 
appeasingly escapist, and 
blissfully numbing. It is 
the perfect antidote to 
midterm stress - whisk-
ing you away from the 
clawsofUCboredom and 
transporting you to a more 
civilized, exciting place. 

The amalgamated 
style of music played by 
Attack members 3-D, 
Mushroom and Daddy G draws from 
dancehall, techno, rap, jazz and other 
influences so obscure you ' ll have to 
dig deep into your memory bank to 
identify them. 

After so many disco, classic rock 
and old-school funk revivals, it 'sabout 
time that a new genre besides grunge 
makes an appearance in the main-
stream. Massive Attack may very well 
be the band to lead such a musical 
movement. 

The title track, "Protection," has a 

slow, spongy beat, mothering lyrics 
and soothing brassy vocals (read: 
Sade's "LoveDcluxe" deconstrucled). 
Guest vocalist, Tracey Thorn, from 
Everything But the Girl, sings the 
vocals on thc title track and also ar-
ticulates lipsticked retorts to a squab-
bling adversary in "Better Things," 
uttering words like "bullshit" with the 
composure of a parlor conversation. 

"Spying Glass," which has gar-
nered radio airplay, is the most trium-
phantlrack on the album, and heralds 
a long-awaited alternative 10 Ace of 

Base or the ump-teenth 
Eddie Vedder hymn. Com-
bining a sweeping techno 
beat and distorted, yet con-
struable lead and back-
ground ululations, this track 
summons bubble-gum illu-
sions and deep-blue under-
water encounters. 

All is not heaven in Pro-
teetion, however. Massive 

Attack's cover of the Doors' "Light 
My Fire" is both disrespectful to a 
classic and bordering on ennui. 

Although claiming to have been 
inspired by the Jose Feliciano version 
of the song rather than Ihe original, 
this alteration detracts from the stan-
dard; it doesn't make you want to 
listen to the already over-played '60s 
hit (thanks to director Oliver Stone), it 
makes you want to fling it across the 
room.

JEWEL: Singer 
shows maturity 
Continued from pate H5 
to put out. It was an invaluable 
experience. Without it, I don 'I think 
I could do the shows when you go 
in and it 's a small place and no one 
wants to hear a girl play her guitar. 
All those years of playing with my 
dad taught me how to tum a crowd 
around." 

One of the most remarkable 
qualities of Jewel 's album is that 
in songs such as Â«Adrian" (which 
was co-written by Steve Poltz of 
the Rugburns) and "Daddy," she 
explores human relationships with 
a maturity tharbelieS her age. Al-
though "Daddy" is nol about her 
own father, the song astutely ex-
amines an abusive father and the 
way a child subconsciously imi-
tates his mentality. 

"I wrote it about when I went to 
a friend 's house for dinner and we 
went to the kids ' room- to watch 
TV. We were watching 'The 
Jeffersons,' and her dad came into 
the room and turned it off because 
she wasn 't allowed to watch black 
people on TV," Jewel said. 

"I had never heard sucha thing, 
and I think it's just amazing what 
an influence parents haveoverour 
lives in ways that we aren't even 
capable of comprehending. I origi-
nally called the song ' Me about 
You,' but it was 100 abstract a 
title. " 

Jewel will perform today at 
7:30 and 10 p.m. atthe Hahn Cos-
mopolitan Theatre downtown. 
Tickets for both shows are sold 
out.

The 
Rug burns 

Group will play 
at Winter Fest 

celebration 
By Jeff Nlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

Two years ago the band King 
Missile scored an alternative radio hit 
with its offbeat song "Detachable 
Penis." The Rugbums, a San Diego-
based band, has had similar success 
with their hit "Hitchhiker Joe," a song 
about a hitchhiking serial kiUer, from 
last year's Morning Wood. During a 
recent phone interview, singer Steve 
Poltz, who lives near Wind and Sea 
beach in La Jolla, said he didn't think 
his band would be reduced to obscu-
rity like King Missile and 
other "novelty acts" such 
as the Dead Milkmen and 
Timbuk3. 

"'Detachable Penis' 
was King Missile's 'Hitch-
hiker Joe.' I think the dif-
ference between us and 
them is that we have a 
strong nucleus in what we 
do," said Poltz, who has 
been recording with gui-
tarist Robert Driscoll for over 1 0 years. 
"I don't expect success, and it actu-
ally embarrasses me. As far as I'm 
concerned we made it. We made it 10 
years ago when we made our first 
tape." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Courtesy of Bizarre/Planel Records 
The R....,...... wi. pIQ -' the PrIce Center tomorrow -' noon. 

Although Poltz said he was pleased 
with the band's status as a indepen-
dent band, he hopes to sign to a major 
label to attain wider distribution. He 
said the group was scheduled to per-
form in front of record industry repre-
sentatives at Austin's South by South-
west Music Festival in the middle of 
March. 

"It's really different when you're 
not on a major label, be-
cause you don't have the 
distribution. Everyone is 
like, 'It's cool, it's charm-
ing' to be on an indie la-
bel, but it's a drag when 
you go to a city like Santa 
Fe, NM, and out of six 
record stores, only one has 
our album. And they were 
huge Rugburns fans. 
When I told them I was in 

the Rugburns, as far as they were 
concerned, Elvis Presley had walked 
in. The other stores had never heard of 
us. It 's so humbling." 

Poltz said that the band's live 
shows usually convince fans to boy a 

copy of their albums. For the last 10 
years, the band has played at Kelly's 
Old Town Pub in San Diego and now 
regularly fills the 600-capacity Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. 

"The live shows are great. We're 
there to give the people a show. A lot 
of bands just stand there. I see them 
there on TV and I think, 'Give my 
band an opportunity,' Poltz said. 

"Our live shows are selling our 
albums now. We go out and bring 
albums and tee-shirts with us. No one 
knows who we are, and people are 
indifferent at first. Then, if you're 
doing it right, you suck their souls 
right into you, so by the end of the 
show, people are really grooving and 
having a good time. I feel like I ran 
away and joi ned the circus. We're like 
snake-oil salesmen." 

As part of the Winter Fest festival, 
the Rugburns will perform at noon 
tomorrow at the Price Center Plaza. 
The Untouchables will also perform 
tomorrow at 5 p. m. atthe Price Center 
Plaza. For more information, call 534-

65,000 copies. The band's video 
for the single "Plowed" has gotten 
frequent exposure on MTV. Con-
stant touring (the group started 
playing live dates be-
fore the album was re-
leased and will perform 
tomorrow at Dream 
Street) has also helped 
increaseexposure. Dur-
ing a recent phone in-
terview from a tour stop 
in Sacramento, bassist 
Tim Cross said he was 
pleased that the band 
was slowly becoming successful. 

"I'm very happy about it. I was 
always confident about our music 
and thought people would like it. 
I'm really glad the album's doing 
well," Cross said. "Every week 
when we get the numbers in, it just 
keeps amazing me." 

Cross was originally in 
Loudhouse, a Detroit band which 
included current Sponge guitarist 
Mike Cross (his brother) and vo-
calist Vinnie. The band was 
dropped by its record label after 
one album, and Cross said 
Loudhouse was simply a stepping 

stone. 
"Loudhouse was totally different. 

It's just part of the past that got us to 
where we are now," Cross said. "We 
haven't brought anything from that 
band into Sponge." 

Sponge's lyrics, which are about 
topics such as missed freeway exits 
("Neenah Menasha") and burying 
seeds ("Plowed"), often provide meta-

phors fora despondent ex-
istence. Cross said that 
although critics often note 
the band's apparent pes-
simism, it's not an accu-
rate depidion of the group. 

"I've seen in a couple 
of articles, people pointed 
out that the album makes 
it sound like we are ex-
tremely depressed. I don't 

think anyone of us is neurotic by any 
means, but a lot of the songs just deal 
with everyday experience," Cross said. 

"We had a kid in one town who 
came up to Vinnie and he said, 'Dude, 
I love that song "Giants." I'm just 
going through a hard time in my rela-
tionship right now, and I can totally 
relate to what you're talking about.' 
That 's great when someone actually 
gets the point or they come up to you 
and totally relate to what you're talk-
ing about. That's a great feeling." 

Sponge will perform with Com-
pulsion tomorrow at 9 p.m. at Dream 
Street in Pacific Beach.
