UNA to Picket Against Discriminatory Hiring 
In protest against discriminatory 

employment practices of the California 
Department of Human Resources and 
Development, United Native Americans 
has scheduled a statewide series of 
picketlines, Tuesday, January 29. 

demand that native Americans occupy 
at least two of the top 100 managerial 
and professional positions, 15 among 
the top 1,000 positions, and 100 among 
the top 5,000 positions in California's 
HRD offices. 

native American job developers, 
although funds were available for 
other minority job developers," said 
Brightman. "Today there are still no 
Indian HRD job developers in San 
Francisco, los Angeles or Bishop." 

saying that it was just a piece of paper. 
He further stated that Hansen in-
dicated that he would make no moves 
to ' comply and so far he hasn't." 
Removal of HRD Director Hansen is 
the final demand of the UNA picketers. 

United Native Americans, a national 
Indian organization, demands HRD 
increase native American employment 
from the present level of 36 to 245 
positions. 

"Right now only 36 of 12,162 HRD 
employees are native Americans," 
stated lehman Brightman, Chairman of 
UNA. 

"Of the native Americans presently 
employed by HRD, none are in the top 
1,000 managerial or professional 
positions, three are in the top 5,000 
positions, and less than .3 percent of all 
full-time positions are filled by native 
Americans," stated Brightman. 

A full-scale investigation of HRD by 
. the labor Department to force HRD 

compliance with the equal services 
clause in the Civil Rights Act is the 
third UNA demand. 

"In April 1971, the labor Depart-
ment determined HRD a 'de facto 
discriminator against native 
Americans,''' stated Brightman. "That 
September the labor Department 
issued an order to HRD which 
demanded they comply with the equal 
services clause in the Civil Rights act by 
providing equal services and employ-
ment for minorities." 

"Hansen dislikes m in orities, es-
pecially Indians," explained Bright-
man. "He refused to comply with the 
Civil Rights Act and with the rulings of 
the labor Department. Under 
Hansen 's direction, HRD refuses equal 
employment for native Americans and 
other minorities through indifference, 
bureaucratic incompetence and con-
tinued domination by anglo personnel. 
Hansen is a racist." concluded Bright-
man . 

"Because of poverty, lack of educa-
tion and under-employment, Indians 
are 2Y2 times more likely than Anglos 
to require HRD services," added 
Brightman, "yet HRD has virtually no 
native Americans in managerial , 
counseling or Job developing 
positions." 

UNA's 'picket line represents the 

"According to the Department of 
Industrial Relations , the 160,000 
California Indians have a 20 percent 
higher unemployment rate than 
blacks, earn 25 percent less than black 
or chicanos, and 75 percent of native 
Americans over 25 years of age earn 
less than $5,000 annually." pointed out 
Brightman. 

"In 1967 HRD stated that their 
department had no funds to employ 

Brightman added, "Sigmund Han-
son, executive director of HRD, replied 
to the labor Department's order 

The San Diego picket line will 
organize at 9 a.m. in the parking lot of 
HRD's downtown office. Various 
Women's groups, black, chicano, 
radical Asian, and native American 
groups will participate.

President Thieu Denies 
Suppression, Corruption 

Amidst the news of the peace settlement, a sen-
sational interview with South Vietnamese President 
Nguyen Van Thieu by journalist Oriana Fallaci has gone 
virtually unnoticed. Released four days ago to 
American audiences in the journal The New Republic, 
the interview examines the events leading to the 
breakdown of the October peace agreement and the 
resumption of the bombing, and also contains Thieu's 
answers to the common charges that he is wealthy and 
his regime corrupt and dictatorial. Excerpts are as 
follows: (the interview took place in Saigon on 
December 30). 

Q. President Thieu ... How do you answer those who 
call you the dictator of South Vietnam? 

A. Tiens! Mademoiselle, I don't know if we should 
tape this too with your tape recorder but. .. take a look 
at the countries of Southeast Asia today and then tell 
me which can be called democratic according to your 
concept of democracy. Thailand? Korea? Philippines? 
In all sincerity, it seems to me that Vietnam is the most 
democratic of them all. Maybe not democratic as you 
would like, but democracy isn't a standard to apply in 
an identical way everywhere. Decocracy as they have it 
in America or as you have it in Europe cannot exist here 
as yet. We aren't ready for it yet. Don't forget that 
Vietnam never knew democratic life in the sense that 
you mean it. Until 1945 we were a French colony. Until 
1954 we were dominated by the Vietminh. Until 1963 
we were under President Diem. I take the liberty of 
affirming that democracy began to exist here in 1965 
when I became president. What is your next question? 

Q. I hate to be brutal but I have a series of rather 
brutal questions. First. What about the fact that you're 
called an American puppet or the milln of the 
Americans? 

A. Do the Americans say that? 
Q. Yes, millny Americillns. 

A. I'm the man of the Vietnamese, not the milln of the 
Americans. Even less am I an American puppet and I 
think I have demonstrated that recently, also' in this 
interview. Towards the Americans I feel as a friend and 
an ally, nothing more. I belong to nobody. Pile ase, go 
on. 

Q. Second. What about those who say that you are 
corrupt, the most corrupt man in Vietnam? 

A. Mademoiselle ... lt isn't even worth answering. 
What should I answer? When the slan.der 
machine starts up, there is no way to stop It. Those 
accusations are not made by mistake, they are inten-
tional and made with a purpose. One can correct a 
mistake, not a purpose. So I'll only answer with a 
question I Have you ever seen the daughter of ill 
president living in a pension run by nuns in london? 
Mine lives there. 

Q . Well .. .Iet's put it like this. Is It true that you were 
born very poorf 

A. Very true. My father was In orphan at the ale of 
ten. When he lot married, my mother had to brlnl rice 
and coconuts to the villale mlrket, she hid to sell her

little hut and go live on the other side of the river 
because she needed money. Thanks to her, my elder 
brother could study in Paris; my younger one could 
study in Hue; but I had to attend school in the village. 
My brothers are ambassadors today; they are two self-
made men, but my sisters still bring the basketsofrice 
and chickens to the market as my mother did . Please, 
go on . 

Q . third. Is it true that today you are immensely rich, 
that you have bank accounts and houses in 
Switzerland, in london, in Paris, in Australia? 

A. It isn't true and I swear it on the head of my 
children, that I have nothing abroad. Not the house in 
london, not the house in Paris, not the house in 
Australia, or .in Switzerland. Rumors of this last one 
came to me some time ago, through some Americans 
and I replied: "Messieurs les Americaisn, you have all 
the means for discovering this house and all the best 
cameras to take pictures of it. Show me the photos of 
that house."Mademoiselle, I only have something in 
Vietnam and do you want to know what I have? I have a 
place at headquarters because, being a general, I am 
entitled to possess two bachelor apartments. So I have 
made one apartment out of those two and I have 
modernized it a little to go there and rest on weekends. 
But it doesn't belong to me really; it belongs to the 
army and in fact I'll transform it into a museum when I 
retire. Then I have a wooden house on the river and I 
use it on Sundays when I go waterskIIng on the river. 
It's a prefabricated house, rather Inexpensive, iIInd It 
was given to me by the Union of the lumbermen as a 
gift. Then I have the house where I was born, and It is 
the poorest in the villile. People pass It Ind joke:

little farm where I amuse myself in agricultural ex-
periments. There I grow rice, watermelons; I raise 
chickens and ducks and pigs; and I also have fish in the 
ponds. Thats all. Since I became president, I haven't 
even bought a car ... 

Q. I think it's time to speak about the Vietcong and 
the other major disagreement you had with Dr. 
Kissinger. 

A. Tres bien What I maintain is that the political 
formula accepted by the Americans in October is a 
formula of coalition government that the Communists 
want to impose on us. What I maintain is that we'll 
never accept such a formula, no matter how well 
disguised . I do not impose any form of government on 
Hanoi, and I do not want Hanoi to impose any form of 
government on Saigon ... 

Q. President Thieu, allow me to believe that your 
advice to be patient wasn't the only thing you said to 
Henry Kissinger. Allow me to believe that impatience is 
not the only thing you have to reproach him with . 

A. It isn't. Et voila what I told the Americans : "You ' re 
a giant: you don 't care about anyth ing because you 
having nothing to be afraid of. You weigh 200 pounds, 
and if you swallow 
a pill which is bad for your health, nothing happens to 
you . I am a small man, however, and maybe ... un peu 
ma/ade. I only weigh 100 pounds, and if I swallow the 
same pill, I might die ... A bad agreement means nothing 
to you. To me, it's a matter of life and death . What do 
these 300,000 orth Vietnamese (troops in the South) 
mean to you? Nothing. What is the loss of South 
Vietnam if you look at it on the world's map? Just a 
speck. The loss of South Vietnam may even be good for 
you, sure! It may be good to contain China, good for 
your world strategy. But for me ... it isn't a question of 
choosing between Moscow and Peking. It's a question 
of choosing between life and death." 

Q. I wonder what Dr. Kissinger answered, or at least, 
what he thought. 

A. Mademoiselle ... his strategic conception of the 
world is very smart; a Southeast Asia controlled by the 
Russians, or an Indochina controlled by the Russians, in 
order to control and contain China. Russians are less 
dangerous than the Chinese, so it's necessary to ask the 
Russians to contain the Chinese and to pose Indochina 
as a threat to the south of China .... (But) a little Viet-
namese doesn 't play with a strategic map of the world . 
He has no group interest on this plJnet. He has nothing 
to exchange, no Middle East to exchange with Vietnam, 
no Germany to exchange with Vietnam; he has nothing 
but life and death for 17 million inhabitants! And his 
danger is to fall under the sway of Hanoi, or of Moscow 
and Peking, because it is the same thing ... We're a small 
country, dear American friends . 0 Jr problem is ur-
vival, not the worldly interest of the great powers. Oh, 
these great powers who divide t .1e world among 
them elvesl They have free trade everywhere. and who 
cares if this costs the life ot a small country? 

Q . In other words, President Thieu, your opinion i 
that Dr. Kissinger was going to sell South Vietnam in 
the interest of his world strategy. 

A. 'ft bien. I don 't know if that was hi intention. 
Maybe he thought in complete good faith that it was a 
good agreement, a right iIIgreement. But I know that for 
us it WIS a matter of survival, to be or not to be ...

QUESTION: During 
orgasm, a friend of mine 
passes considerable air 
from the vaginal opening 
with accompanying noises 
not unlike the ordinary 
paSSing of gas. While it is 
true that the phenomenon 
is associated with some 
pattern of vaginal contrac-
tions, neither of us nave 
encountered it in others. 
Would you comment on 
the cause and relative fre-
quency of the occurence 
among women? 

ANSWER: A good char-
coal lighter fluid would 
have the following proper-
ties : it would ignite slowly 
rather than suddenly and 
explosively; it would not 
burn with a high flame and 
smoke excessively; it 
would burn off rapidly and 
would not leave any 
residual odor. Gasoline is 
not an appropriate fluid to 
use to light charcoal fires. It 
is highly explosive and 
flares very highly. Liquid 
charcoal lighter fluids 
should not be added to a 
charcoal fire once the coals 
have been burning since 
there is a risk of the fluid 
catching fire and exploding 
backward into its con-
tainer. The lighter fluid 
usually burns off complete-
ly before one begins to 
cook so there is no danger 
from it.

that every time someone in 
the house gets ill, they 
need a hot, .soapy enema.

violently, but to no avail.

Taking moving pictures 

indoors using photo floods 
is far more difficult for the 
child since the great inten-
sity of the light is unrelen-
ting. Infants have poorly 
pigmented irises and even 
though the eye adjusts to 
the light intensity, a large 
amount of brightness still 
reaches the retina, causing 
considerable discomfort.

ANSWER: The role of 
enemas in medicine has 
declined in importance 
compared to what it was 
earlier in the century. In 
years past when much less 
was known, many illnesses 
were attributed to the large 
intestine and its contents. 
There was a theory of il-
lness based on the absorp-
tion of bacterial toxins 
from the large intestine, for 
insta1]ce. The anus, by 
proyiding such ready 
access to the "filth" - con-
taining intestines, became 
a favorite place to stick in 

ANSWER : During sexual 
excitement in a woman, 
the inner two-thirds of the 
vagina tend to expand con-
siderably in size, 
ballooning outward. Air 
can become trapped in the 
vagina with the in inter-
vaginal pressure, the air 
can escape nOisily. The oc-
curence of the 
phenomenon would be 
dependent upon the 
vigorousness with which 
intercourse is engaged in, 
the position assumed, the 
anatomy of the people in-
volved, and auditory acui-
ty. Be assured, there is no 
way that I can comment on 
the frequency of this oc-
curence. As with most 
other erotic phenomena, 
the fact that it can be ex-
plained on normal 
physiological grounds 
should be sufficiently 
reassuring, and the need 
for precise statistical defini-
tion is gilding the lily. 

An additional word of 
caution : charcoal fires 
produce tremendous 
amounts of carbon monox-
ide and under no cir-
cumstances should they be 
used indoors. Therehave 
been a number of reported 
deaths from using charcoal 
fires indoors and quite a 
few of these have come 
from peopleusing them in 
camper trailers where the 
enclosed space is small and 
toxic levels of corbon 
monoxide can build up 
within a few minutes.

Little children almost in-

with terror and link it with 
punishment. For your 
mother to persist in giving 
you an enema at age 20 is 
not justified on 
physiological grounds and

What Price Peace? 
There is a weariness in many people across 

America today. Tomorrow there may be rejoicing, 
there may be relief. But the odds are great that 
there will stili be that weariness-a moral 
weariness-as the people of this country watch like 
a deaf, dumb, and blind audience, the final act of 
the spectacle of the last two decades. They 
bought their admission tickets with their 
birthrights. It used to seem a bargain"Amerlca" 
was the Greatest Show in Earth; at least, that ws 
what they were told and may have even believed. 
But with changes In age, awareness, and 
affluence, there occurs a curious split In attitude. 
Too many can no longer be dazzled by the 
spectacle of America any more than they can by 
the circus. 

The bubble has burst and too many are just 
plain tired; they are tired of restraining the anger, 
frustration, and disillusion of awareness. The 
ringleader is no longer that magnificent man he 
once appeared to be; he is now treacherous, 
ruthless, and truly a master of only ceremonies. 

Some found themselves clowns; they broke the 
tension and provided some comic relief while the 
lions and tigers and bears of Industry, labor, and 
politics danced and pranced for their master . The 
audience laughed because they could not un-
derstand what was being said. But the ringmaster 
raged, because he feared what the clowns knew, 
and whipped them Into mute submission. 

Perhaps some remain clowns. But most have 
sensed the futility of their role, and it is that sense 
of futility which leaves them powerless. In the 
pragmatics of practical politics, the Intelligentsia 
finds itself powerless. And that is who we clowns 
are, Richard Nixon. You wln ... but you play dirty. 
The make-up is off, now. There is no longer 
anything with which to disguise the moral 
questions that have hovered above our shoulders 
and yours. You win, Richard Nixon, but at what 
price? America, Mr. President. You have 
destroyed this country morally, pOlitically, 
economically, and some have gladly let you do 
so. But where is your bag of tricks now? How can 
you cope with a big-top full of customer and NO 
SHOW? You , sir, are in the center ring, and the 
spotlight is precisely where you have always 
wanted it on you . You now bear the moral 
responsibility of every man, woman, and child In 
this country; that is the nature of your position. 

And perhaps now you think it Is a one-man 
show? The show is over, Mr. President. Take a 
look around you: the audience is gone. Oh, you 
have a full house? They're only dummies, 
because we finally saw the strings. You tuned us 
out long ago, when we still though what we said , 
and did , and cared about really mattered. But you 
managed to systematically destroy, intim idate, or 
buy your way Into every show in town. Big-time 
operators we don't enjoy. For us, the circus just 
isn 't any fun any more.

The Freed 
One of the most dangerous notions currently being 

propogated by this nation's anti-intellectual establishment is 
the idea of selective censorship. According to this notion, 
the propogators of "correct" ideas have a right to forcibly 
suppress the expression of "incorrect" ideas, whether based 
on the bourgeois tenets of capitalism, racism, sexism, or war. 
Such a view has manifested itself in such diverse attempts as 
those of a group of women's liberationists to block a debat~ 
on the legal status of abortion, or of a group of students and 
faculty to prevent the teaching of "racist" ideas or to 
violently suppress military recruitment on campus, or of all 
among this nation's professional Intellectuals who have 
resorted to every subtle form of threat, intimidation, ca-
jolery and coercion to suppress the ideas they opposed and 
to the'reby create an atmosphere not of intellectual freedom, 
but of uneasiness, regimentation, and fear. 

But these efforts, according to their proponents, are not. 
abrogations of freedom of speech; they are merely reinter-
pretations of the meaning of this most fundar:nental of 
human rights within the context of a new and enlightened 
age. They are merely manifestations of "repressive 
tolerance" designed to protect the innocent and unsuspec-
ting masses from ideas injurious to their class welfare. 
Freedom of speech must now be reinterpreted as the right of 
individuals to express "correct" ideas, these to be deter-
mined by the verdict of those in authority. It should not be 
taken to include the expression of ideas by fat-cat capitalists, 
male-chauvinist-pigs, genocidal racists, or imperialist war-
mongers. 

To understand the deeper implications behind the doc-
trine of selective censorship, we must ask ourselves two 
fundamental questions: what is the meaning of freedom of 
speech, and what is the purpose and function of free~m of 
speech within the context of a free or even semi-free 
society? 

Freedom of speech is the right of every individual to freely 
express his ideas without fear of violent and forcible suppres-
sion from others. It is the right of every individual to think for 
himself, to draw his own conclusions, and to attempt to non-
coercively persuade others of the validity of his conclusions. 
It must be emphasized that this does not bestow upon any 
individual the right to violently invade the person or proper-
ty of another. 

What is the purpose of freedom of speech? Historically, 
the idea of freedom of speech originated in response to the 
arbitrary attempts of despotic rulers to forcibly suppress the 
expression of ideas contrary to the liking of the despot. 
Throughout history, the authoritarian institutions of church 
and state had attempted to suppress unpopular ideas and 
persecute their propogators as heretics and rebels. The great 
victims of this policy of mental genocide were always the 
same the ihinkers, the innovators, the audacious young men 
and women of creative genius who challenged and uprooted 
the entire foundation of human knowledge, the great 
benefactors of mankind, the fountainheads ' of human 
progress. How many such great human beings perished in 
obscurity along with such gifts as they possessed will never 
be known. What is important is that mankind learn the lesson 
of their destruction. 

It was to prevent the suppression not of popular, but of 
unpopular ideas, that led to the establishment of freedom of 
speech as a basic human right. People had always had the 

Ciao! Manhattan: Trahiso 
Time was when the artist served a positive and respectable 

function in society. He may have been a mild-mannered 
Bach, a tortured Rimbaud, an egocentric Wagner, but he 
belonged and contributed to the value and distinction of his 
civilization. The richness of human experience, from radiat 
pulchritude to dark tragedy, was his substance; the wisdom 
and edification of high culture were the lasting products of 
his endeavors. 

Such inspiring thoughts must remain in the past tense, 
however, for it is a truism that they have been under 
sustained and direct attack throughout our generation. The 
very foundations of civility, of what Russell Kirk calls the 
"moral imagination," are arrogantly and peremptorily 
challenged by the literary-intellectual Zeitgeist as never 
before. And the result, the inevitable harvest of what has 
been sown, is the accelerating moral and cultural decay of 
our society. 

The decade of the Sixties in particular seems to bring out, 
in garish psychedelic colours, the various aberrances and 
depravities produced by modern "artists." Woodstock-
Altamont, street theater, the drug cult, "sensory awareness," 
such are the phenomena at which future historians will shake 
their heads, wondering what happened to the Western 
civilization that produced Sophocles, Dante, Mozart. 
Perhaps they will mark our generation as an affluent Dark 
Age, a cemetery of the human spirit ruled by barbarism and 
decadence. 

Ciao! Manhattan a film currently receiving lavish praise 
from the critics, is a prime example of contemporary trends. 
It is the story, more or less, of Edie Sedgwick, a lovely 
socialite who Joined the nightmare world of Andy Warhol in 
the Sixties, ran the gamut of drugs and schizophrenia, and 
consummated her marriage to haUl monde by dying of an 
overdose at the age of 28. Set in the dissolute whirlwind of 
New York's avant-garde, Ciaol confronts us with a dis-
organized kaleidoscope of pathetic characters, tragicomic 
semiscenes, and black-and-white flashbacks to Edie's past 
interspersed with the rainbow surrealism of her present. 
Most of the movie is spent watching this oddly charming 
creature stumble about in an amphetamine stupor, float In 
and out of weird subplots, and amiably wallow In the utmost 
depths of human depravity, until we are left only with 

to agree with the Ideas of those In power; it was the 
to disagree even with the established doctrines of the 

re world that had to be protected. It was precisely to 
ntain a society in which each person could freely and 
nly express his ideas, irrespective of their content, that 

, ....... ,rinm of speech became established as a -fundamental 
n right. 

Freedom of speech has always been incomprehensible to 
who viewed human communication as just so many 

rds, phrases, sentences, and grammatical structures. It has 
seemed superfluous to those who viewed human 

munication as ,an exchange of arbitrary, meaningless 
ysical sounds having no relation to the real world. It was to 
e glory of those who understood that the purpose of 
man communication is the exchange of ideas, that 

Ire'ea,om of speech is the political implementation of the 
hrinrinl .. of f~eedom of thought, that human beings may live 

enjoy the greatest and most treasured of all freedoms. 
What protection do men have against false, destructive 

The greatest of all human capacities reason. To the 
n who refuses to betray the verdict of his own mind, no 

er on earth may force him to act otherwise. He is 
ne from all the world's corruption and betrayal. And 
the free market for goods maximizes men's wealth of 

and services, the free market for ideas maximizes 
's wealth of facts and ideas, enabling them to select 
e ideas which they believe to be true and to discard 

ideas which they believe to be false, just as they would 
those products and services which maximize their 
and discard all others. In an atmosphere of freedom 
each person is free to draw his own conclusions and 

his own ideas, where every individual has access to a 
flow of information, false ideas have no way to win. False 
s have never been able to stand up to the rigor of logical 
"~OIV(I( . Where they have won, they have won not by 

umph, but by default. The propogators of fallacies must

An Open 
Letter To All 
You '5exua/s' 
Editor, TRITON TIMES: 

This is an open letter' to 
J., Jeff W., J.R., the "mad 
Armenian," my friend 
Morgan J., and all 
members of the UCSD 
community, homosexual, 
heterosexual, and just plain 
sexual. 

First, let me join with Jeff 
in expressing gratitude to J. 
for opening the discussion. 
I would also like to thank 
,.R. for demonstrating how 
completely insensitive to 
the problem some non-
homosexuals can be. Both 
he and Jeff seem to think 
that the main reason we 
don't all wear 1.0. buttons 
telling our sexual orienta-
tion is fear of losing our 
friends or of being beaten 
up. Even J. misses the point 
by saying the reason is our 
own "inhibitions" im-
planted by society. I'm not 
being inhibited, I'm being 
silenced under duressl 

Morgan points out that a 
debate cannot begin 
without facts, so let me 
point out a few: First, as in 
42 other states, homosex-
ual acts are illegal in the 
state of California (Penal 
Code Sections 286 and 
288a). Second, the Federal 
government holds that 
even an admission of viola-
tion of these laws (not 
necessarily a conviction) 
shows a "criminal propen-
sity" which can cost a man 
a job with a federal con-
tractor. This is, of course, 
being contested in the 
courts, but that takes time 
and money and in the 
meantime, the law holds. 

Morgan feels " financially 
liberated" and thinks this 
gives us a good apportunity 
to dedicate ourselves to 
civil liberties. Good. 
Working for federal con-
tractors is nat exactly liber-
tarian work anyway, so 
how about working for the 

Equal Emplo~ment Oppor-
tunities Commlssionl Third 
fact : A clerk-typist with the 
Seattle office of the 
E.E.O.C. was fired by order 
of the U.S. Civil Services 
Commission as of January 
5 ,1973, because of 
"notoriously disgracefu I 
conduct" in that he openly 
admitted to being a 
homosexual. A plea for an 
injunction to prevent this 
was denied in U.S. district 
court on the grounds that 
the Civil Service Commis-
sion has "very wide dis-
cression" as to whom it will 
keep on after a 
probationary period. 

The fou rth fact involves 
my personal reasons for 
not identifying myself: I 
have invested many years 
in preparing myself for a 
ca reer of research and 
teaching which will very 
likely involve employment 
by either a state or the 
Federal government. You, 
Morgan, have not. This is 
the main reason you can 
sign your letter and I can-
not sign mine. Not because 
you are less " radical," not 
because of your, shall we 
say, " pan -sexua l " 
philosophy, but because of 
a lack of previous com-
mitments. 

Morgan, in spite of our 
differences, you know I 
love you, and I hope you 
never know the loneliness 
of " being gay." Because of 
your philosophy, and your 
early commitment to it, I 
don't think you ever will. 
But I, and others like me do 
feel a loneliness and 
frustration born of en-
forced silence. We don't 
need to shout it to the 
world, but just to let it be 
understood, in every sense 
of the word, that we are 
Homosexuals. 

What can we do to fight 
this repression? One th ing 
is to pluck up our courage, 
declare ourselves, and do 
battle. I intend to, one day, 
but I intend to pick my 
battlefield carefully. I'm 
not going to be caught in a

My recommendation, to 
those who feel they can, is 
to follow Morgan 's ex-
ample: Decide early what 
your own se xual 
philosophy and orientation 
is, and how important it is 
to you. If freedom of ex-
pression is going to be of 
value, claim it now, before 
circumstances rob you of 
it. 

You see, J.R., I don't care 
if my straight friends figure 
out who I am and what I 
am . I know, and they 
know, that I am a person of 
worth, no matter what my 
sex life is. If they don 't, and 

source of facts : the 
biweekly newspaper "The 
Advocate." I hate to sound 
like a paper Hawker, but 
it's really the only place I 
know to get facts like the 
ones 1 mentioned earlier, 
especially in. San Diego. 
Ask your gay friends, or try 
one of the "adult" 
bookstores in town. 

Above all , be com-
passionate : if the gay world 
feels threatened by, and 
fears the straight, the con-
verse is also true. Whatever 
role we choose, or fate 
chooses for us, there is a 
little of Morgan's pan-
sexuality in all of us. Can 
you imagine the fear an 
uptight, straight male must 
feel when a little of that 
bubles to the surface upon 
seeing a beautiful young 
man at the beach? 

I lose them as f riends, I 
haven't lost much. I can 
find new f riends. I am 
stuck, however, with 
myself, and with society, 
After much emotional 
pain, I have managed to 
accept myself both in-
tellectually and emotional-
ly. 1 like myself as I am. I 
don't ask society to like 
me, just to understand me 
and to grant me my rights 

"I don ' t know where to 
start 

There are scars I could 
show 

as a human being. The fact 
that this was not the case 
was of no help to me, and 
will be of no help to the 
"mad Armenian, " who is in C 
the first stages of trying to 
learn to like himself. 

You can help, if you will, 
all you pan-sexuals , 
heterosexuals, and fellow 
homosexuals, by be ing 
aware that the battle exists. 
Homosexu als especially : if 
you can ' t afford to let 
others become aware of 
you, at least be aware of 
yourself. May I suggest, for 
the education of all, a good

Tuesday night's opening 
of "One flew over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" at the 
Cassius Carter Centre StaRe 
in Balboa Park was a 
resounding success. The 
opening performance was 
lauded by both the 
audience and actorS in an 
opening night symposium 
held after the perfor -
mance. 

The Dale Wasse rman 
drama is based on the well 
known novel by Ken 
Kesey. The play seems to 
retain much of the original 

Ph lorescence 
Tomorrow 

Two of the zaniest comics who ever 
played music, and a far-out comedian , 
are headlining a concert Jan. 27 at 
UCSD. 

The musicians are Mark Volman and 
Howard Kaylan, now leaders of the 
Phlorescent leech & Eddie group. The 
comedian is Murray Roman, also a com-
edy writer for many top TV shows and 
various comics. 

Vol man and Kaylan started with Frank 
Zappa and the Mothers of Invention -:-
or possibly with the Turtles. They dId 
play with both groups, but in an int~rÂ­
view said they never remembered which 
came first - the Mothers or the Turtles. 

Coincidentally, as Phlorescent leech 
& Eddie, the two men broke in the new 
group at the Funky Quarters in Sa.n 
Diego, to fine reviews and good public 
acclaim. "We were big in San Diego for a 
couple of nights," admitted Kaylan . 
"Then they caught on to us and ran us 
out of town on a PSA Jumbo Jet ." 

The band clowns around on stage, and 
enjoys itself, but underneath it all is 
excellent musicianship. Enough for 
Reprise Records to cut two albums with 
Phlo & Eddie, as they prefer being 
called. 

" But only because they think we' re 
really the Rolling Stones," laughed 
Volman. "I told them I was Mick 
Jagger." 

flavor of the novel and, 
with the exception of the 
fishing trip, which would 
be hard to do on a stage, 
most of the scenes one 
remembers from the novel 
appear in the play version. 

For those who have 
never read the novel, 
" One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" involves 
the invasion of a mental 
ward by a rather picares-
que and/ or revolutionary 
hero known as Randall P. 
McMurphy . Russell T. 
Rohrer, making his Old 
Globe debut along with 13 
other members of the 20 
member cast, makes an 
almost excellent 
McMurphy. Combining a 
verite type realism and an 
apparently inborn feeling 
for the rouguish , Rohrer 
turns in a rather convincing 
performance. One can 
laugh, one can cry, one can 
face McMurphy's despair

a5 he discovers that the 
system always has one 
more weapon available 
with which to beat one into 
submission . 

Big Nurse, or Miss 
Ratched, played by Tyler 
Wynn, is the representative 
of that system. She con-
sistently finds a way to 
defeat Mc Murphy. For in-
s tance, at one point 
McMurphy ucceeds in 
getting the members of the 
ward to vote for changing 
television time so that the 
members can watch the 
World Series, but Nurse 
Ratched claims that the 
meeting was over after the 
majority vote was raised so 
the group cannot watch 
the World Series. Tyler 
Wynn is a most impressive 
Nurse Ratched. She is so 
intimidating with her eyes 
that at one point in the play 
I felt like telling her 
something. During the 
after play symposium , 
many of those commenting 
made the same charg It 
may sound like a criticism, 
but indeed it is a high com-
pliment for this role.

authority of a diclatoriai

The subord inate ca5t 
fares equally as well 15 
Rohrer and Wynn. Robert 
Barranger as Chief Broom 
performs a difficult role 
excellently. As Director 
Craig Noel pointed out in 
the symposium, "We had 
someone who was a 
behaviorist come in and 
show Robert how a 
catatonic should act." 

"One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" is playing 
at the Cassius Carter Cen-
tre Stage through Feb. 18.

teresting contest of the day 
was a rough and hard-
hitting game with ruggers 
on both sides tired but 
determined . The teams 
battled to a 0-0 tie at half 
time with strong defensive 
play by Dr. Ric Jones and 
almost-a-doctor Phil 
Maseritti. Both Bob Beck 
and Joe Simmian were also 
in ther leading a fine 
defensive surge. The se-
cond half got moving when 
John I-wa nt - to-be-a-Dr. 
Ringwood, playing his se-
cond game of the day, 
danced 35 yards for a hard-
fought score. The Tritons 
gained momentum and 
scored again a few minutes 
later on a smart run by 
Mike Capp, assisted by a 
very neat fake by the 
novice Phil Maseritti. Doc-
tor Ric, between ad -
min is terin g to the 
wounded , converted 
successfully. The final score 
ended up 10-0.
