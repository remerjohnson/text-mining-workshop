Researchers develop 
diagnostic method 

A new computer-imaging 
technique that provides a 
precise, three-dimensional image 
of the thigh bone may prove to 
be a useful tool in the early 
detection of osteoporosis, as well 
as for monitoring the course of 
the disease . 

Using computed tomography 
(CT) scanning, radiologists at the 
UCSD School of Medicine have 
developed a way to measure the 
density of the thigh bone (femur) 
and accurately assess early, subtle 
changes in bone mass. Excessive 
loss of bone mass leads to 
osteoporosis, a dibilitating 
disease wwhose victims are at 
high risk of hip fracture . 

In a paper published in the 
September issue of Radiology, the 
UCSD physicians report that 
their technique is as reliable as 
other diagnostic methods 
currently in use for measuring 
thigh bone density. The 
procedure involves less radiation 
than conventional x-rays and 
utilizes equipment available at 
most hospitals . 

The new technique is called 
three-dimensional volumetric CT 
bone denSitometry. CT scanning 
is an x-ray technique which 
produces detailed images of 
selected planes, or slices, of 
various Types of tissue . Computer 
software analyzes the data from a 
series of slices and provides a 
mean bone density measurement 
of the area being studied . The 
procedure takes a~ut twenry . 
minutes of the patients tlme, ts 
painless and evaluates both 
femurs simultaneously. 

Philosophy meeting to 
discuss phenomenology 

The Southern California 
Instinue for Hussenlian 
Phenomenlogy (SCIHP) will hold 

its inaugural meeting in the 
seminar room of the UCSD 
Philosophy Department on 
October 16 at 5:30. The 
meeting will offer an opportunity 
for phenomenologists who wish 
to discuss special topics, read 
papers or share their own work 
in phenomenology. 

Phenomenology is a 
philosophical method developed 
by the German logician Edmund 
Husserl in the early nineteen 
hundreds. Its use is widespread 
on the European continent, but 
is relatively unknown in the 
United States. 

SCIHP is trying to spread the 
use of phenomenology in 
universities and colleges 
throughout California. 

Dr. James L. Ruddy, a visiting 
scholar at the UCSD Philosophy 
Department, and founder of 
SCIHP will host the meeting. 

Chern prof awarded 
honoraty degree 

Ernest Wenkert. Professor of 
Chemistty at UCSD was awarded 
a degree of Doctor honoris causa 
from the University of Perugia. 
This was the 24th such honoraty 
degree to be issued in the 700-
year hiStory of the presti~ous 
Italian university. A speCial, 
ancient ceremony in Latin with 
participation of the science 
faculty, university administration 
and distingUished community 
members accompanied the 
granting of the award. 

Dr. Wenkert IS an 

inte rnationally recognized expert 
in the field of organochemical 
synthesiS, especially of naturally 
occurring substances. His 
research spans a broad range of 
structurally complex compounds 
from terpenic perfumery 
chemicals, prostaglandins and 
leukotrienes to anticancer and 
antihypertension alkaloid drugs. 
For some time he has been 
engaged in close collabora rive 
research with chemistry groups 
abroud, especially in France and 
Italy. He was the recipient of an 
honorary degree from the 
Unive rsity of Paris in 1978.

$5 billon budget 
proposed for UC 
A proposed University of California budget of close to $5 billion was 
presented to the Regents last 
wee k, allocating more m oney for 
fac ulty and facilities . 

UC President David Gardner 
proposed an increase of $295 
million , or 6 .5 percent, over the 
current budget. It was the first 
budget in four years that did not 
seek a double-digit increase in 
suppOrt for. the University. 

However, Gardner told a joint 
meeting of the regents' Finance 
Committee and the Grounds a nd 
Buildings Committee that hi s 
figures were not yet final. They 
did not include any money for 
higher salaries for the faculty and 
staff. 

Gardner said that the salary 
figures , to be presented at the 

ovember regents' meeting, may 
increase his budget p roposal 
increase to 10 percent. 

It will be necessary, Gardner 
ad ded , to retain the gains that 
were made iR recent years, when 
state support brought UC sa laries 
back "to a competitive level" and 
made it possible to stem the loss 
of faculty to better-paying 
I nstitutions. "We must not lose 
our momentum," he declared . 

Although the committees will 
nor vore on the budget until 
November, Gardner appeared to 
win unanimous backing from 
regents who listened to his 
proposal. No regent proposed 
that any items be deleted . 

The major hurdle for approval 
is expected to come later, when 
the budget is submitted to 
Governor Deukmejian and the 
Legislature. Although both have 
proved receptive to the 
university'S needs in recent 
years, the budgets have not gone 
through Sacramento unscathed . 

The recent panern has seen 
the budget trimmed back by 
about $100 million before

winning final approval. 
"This will not lund all our 

needs," Gardner said during a 
meeting at the Laurel Heights 
campus of UC San Francisco. "I 
have chosen to defer some 
requests and to stretch others 
over a longer period of time ." 

He and other administration 
officials provided the regents 
with a thick sheaf of documents 
to bolster the case that some 
increases are inevitable . 

The reports predicted that 
enrollment would rise by 2893 In 
the 1987-88 academic year to a 
total of 148.137 - of whom 
109,960 would be 
undergraduates. The remainder 
would be graduate students and 
medical students. 

Every time 17 1/2 students are 
added to the enrollment, the 
regents were told , it is necessary 
to hi re another faculty member 
and provide him or her with 
olTice facilities and eouioment. 

Gardner said he was seeking 
$750,000 to improve the training 
of graduate teaching assistants 
who provide much of the 
instruction to freshman and 
soph omore undergraduates. 

Modest increases in spending 
will also be needed to enable the 
univesity to live up to itS 
commitment in affirmative action 
programs, Gardner said . 

According to Gardner's 
proposal. nearly $2 billion of the 
budget for the nine-campus 
institution would be financed by 
the state - or about $125 
million more than the university 
presently receives in state funds . 

The remainder would include 
$835 million in income from fees 
at the five UC hospi tals , $600 
million in federal funds , $300 
million in student fees, $200 
million in gifts and contractS, as 
well as income from 
miscelleneous sources. Student 
fees are expected to rise nearly 9 
percent. ~

"(The Navajo) don 't have the

Monico continued . 'The land

past 100 years the Navajo have

unfortunate part is that (the

The Navajo have lived on the

generations, Deal said. Deal's 
grandmother, who died at the

The problem was caused partly 
by the difference in the tribes'

The Navajo are nomadic sheep

Coochyouma's claim 
contradicts traditional Hopi 
beliefs. Deal said . "(Hopi)

Below them at the foot of the

he said, citing information he 
had learned from Hopi elders.

and the head of the household ." 

Relocation benefits include 
$500 for moving expenses, up to 
$55 ,000 for housing a family of

for families of four or more , 
Tessler said. Reimbursement for

The center, described by the

The enforcers challenge enforcement 
Last Friday afternoon, while walking amidst the tables set up by 

various student organizations at Fall Festival on the Green, we 
happened upon an organizational name that was unfamiliar to us. The 
organization itself is not a stranger to us - it is the U.S. Navy - nor 
are their woeful techniques at disquising themselves. In this instance 
they asked their student R.0.T.c. representatives to think of a clever 
pseudonym for the controversial recruiting ann of the Pentagon . The 
RO.T.C.ies thought of "Zero - Zero Yacht Club," and it stuck like 

dividing itself from the rest of campus when push comes to shove, and 
last year called student referenda "merely adviSOry." Knowing this, and 
that the student activists who have fought against on campus 
recruitement in the past are themselves essentially divided, the Navy 
believed that they could walk on to campus and plant their "yachting" 
table. This was not to be. 

On Friday, the Navy met up with a group of vocal opponents who 
demanded that they leave. A compromise was reached, and the 
opponents agreed to let them recruit unhindered for the day as long as 
the AS President would see to it that they would not return again. The 
activists claim tha President Riley consented to thiS, but come Monday, 
the Air Force RO.T.C. had appeared . The activists marched the Air 
Force representative (along with his table) down to the AS office to be 
dealt with . The AS President then apparently asked the administration 
to handle the problem. Yesterday, the Air Force showed-up, and Revelle 
Dean Ernie Mort gave them the boc~. 

mildew does on the bottoms of old aircraft carriers. 
With the knowledge ~hat in the last rwo years the UCSD student body 

had overwhelmingly supponed a referenda that prevents the CIA, FBI, 
INS, apd the military from recruiting warriors on campus, the Navy was 
put in a very uncomfortable position in regards to attracting our 
campus's finest misguided parriots to military service. Although the 
military is presendy allowed to sponsor RO.T.C. students at UCSD, 
(though they must go to SDSU to panicipate in RO.T.C. training and 
coursework), they have been effectively checked in their efforts to 
establish a visible, uniform presence on the plazas and counyards. This 
does not please the Pentagon or Depanment of Defense, however, 
especially after UCSD acquired $30 million dollars worth of DOD and 
DOE (Department of Energy) research projects in this year alone. So this 
Fall they tried a new tactic , instt::ad of lobbying UCSD administrators to 
eliminate student opposition to their soliciting presence, (which has 
failed abysmally in the past), they ordered their recruits to establish a 

The story has not ended though, it has only just begun. For the 
military will not quit in their quest to govern the entire county of San 
Diego, and the AS Council must decide whether or not they will stick to 
their campaign pledges of "honoring and enforcing student referenda." 
The AS Constitution does not help them in this question, as that sparse 
and vague doctrine gives no binding defini tion of the meaning and 
lawfullness of referenda.

The Navy, which has not always been aware of what weaknesses an 

opposition holds, must have decided that it is the AS Council that is 
mostl exploitable . They realize that the Council is young, has a history of 

The time has come then, to begin ammending the constitution so it 
does not place the entire student body in a dangerously ambiguous 
position of not knOwing whether or not their elected representatives will 
stand behind them and enforce their democratic convictions, or be left 
to defend themselves against the world's most powerful recruiting body. 

Praise the Lord, the cash is coming! 
By JOHN RSHER 

With eyes closed tightly and a 
quivering, fervently prayerful 
visage. the blue-suited man 
speaks in a trembling voice. 
"One 0{ our television viewers is 
a carpenter who's been OUt of 
work for eleven months with 
back problems. Even now, he lies 
in bed, unable to move. Sir, m 
the name of the Lord and 
Saviour I command you to rise 
and walk!" 

After several ecsratlc chants of 
"Praise the Lord," the picture 
blurs and, as a choir begins 
humming "The Old Rugged 
Cross" in the background, the 
screen re-focuses and we see a 
previously recorded SpOt in 
which the evangelist walks slowly 
..long the shore of a secluded 
beach, spectacles in one hand , 
Bible in the Other. With mist 
formmg in his eyes, he begins 
relating the triumphs of hIS 
ministry in Africa. "But, " he 
says, "we are on the verge of a 
severe financial crisis. Unless we 
receive offerings of at least forty 
dollars a month from each of our 
viewers. we'U be forcd to shut 
down our operations. Without 
your financial suppOrt, the 
ministry will die ." 

If you've ever scanned the tube 
on a Sunday morning. chances 
are you've heard something like 
this before - testimonials of 
God's healing power, followed by 
extensive pleas for "love 
offerings." Unless a viewer is a 
regularly donating "prayer 
parmer," his typical reaction IS to 
either keep watching for 
entertamment, or to continue 
pressing the channel selector 
before finally settling on "Popeye 
and Friends." 

Yet, there are many Americans 
who take the nationally televised 
evangelists seriously. The 
practice of saving souls and 
healing 'hangnails via the 
airwaves has blossomed into a 

megabucks industry, and these 
ubiquitous messengers of the 
Good News of Salvation, together 
with the not-so-good news of 
"send us your money," see not 
reason to end their involvement 
in the hard-sell techniques. 

But, it's okay, right? I mean, if 
I want to waste my money on 
Pac-Man and someone else 
wants to blow his on magic 
napkins personally touched by 
Oral Roberts which guarantee 
financial prosperity within a year 
("or your money back"), u's his 
prerogative. After all, the freedom 
to worship (or not worship) God 
in the way one chooses is a 
liberty Americans hold dear to 
their hearts; and it's not 
something that has been 
historically taken lightly. For 
instance, recall the recent 
prosecution of the Reverend 
Syung Moon for income tax 
evasIOn. Despite the fact that 
most informed people outside of 
the Unification Church know 
that it's nothing more than an 
opportunistic cuit, many 
politlcally active churches. as 
well as members of the news 
media, banded together to decry 
the "persecution" he was 
suffering. So, as far as religion 
goes, I'm okay, you're okay and 
faith healers are okay, right? 

Wrong. Typically, the faithful 
viewers of television healers are 
old or low-wage eamers who 
have termmal diseases or are 
people Just looking for better 
luck in life. They desperately 
hope that the lies they are being 
fed on television might be true , 
and that maybe someday they 
can be the guest who testifies 
how God healed them . So they 
continue to empty their bank 
accounts and deduct from their 
SOCial Secumy checks. 

Where does this money go? 
According to an article in the Los 
Angeles Times, televangelist Oral 

Roberts bought a Beverly Hills 
mansion in 1982 for $2.4 million 
and he belongs to twO country 
clubs (one of which required an 
initial membership fee of 
$35,000). and regularly travels in 
a "company-owned" eight-
passenger jet. When confronted 
with the apparent hypocrisy of 
his family's lifestyle, Roberts 
shrugged it off, saying he 
worships a God who "doesn't 
deserve second-best." He added, 
"We don 't live like paupers." 
Patti Roberts, Roberts' former 
daughter-in-law, wrote in her 
bOOk Ashes to Gold, "It is hard to 
maintain a servant's heart when 
you dress bener than 99 percent 
of the world land] when you 
play golf with senators and 
VJlcation with heads of multi-
million -dollar corporations .... " 

So much for Oral Roberts. 

Surely most of the other 
preachers are legit. Jimmy 
Swaggert, for example. That man 
seems really sincere - about 
your money. 

An investigative reporter, 
concerned about the veraCity of 
some of Swaggert's claims, did 
some research into the 
destination of funds VIewers had 
donated to feed starving children 
in Africa. He found that of the 
$62 million raised, only $3 
million reached Africa. That's not 
even five percent! The reporter 
says that when he told Swaggert 
of his findings, the preacher 
cited the $3 million figure as 
probably toO low and began 
talking about the high cost of 
purchasing airtime on lV. 

Understand, I write this nor as 
a cynical atheist bent on 
destroying people's faith, but 

rather as a Christian who is 
nauseated by the flagrantly 
fraudulent promises these 
charlatans are knocking 
terminally-ill people over the 
head with. Simony--the practice 
of buyi ng and selling the 
miraculous gifts of the Holy 
Spirit - was condemned as 
wrong two thousand years ago by 
the apostle Peter, and it's wrong 
today. Remember,that what 
touched off the Protestant 
Reformation in the sixteenth 
century was the sale of 
indulgences to fi nance the re-
construction of Saint Peter's 
Cathedral in Rome. 
I once heard a Ch ristian wonder 
aloud if God saves the deepest 
pits of hell for faith-healing 
quacks. While his wording was 
perhaps a bit strong, I can 
understand his bitterness. ~

Editor: 

I present to you a problem 
and a solution The problem IS 
one that I have noticed since my 
earhest days In the Third College 
Writing Program. The solution IS 
the only pIa usible answer to thr 
problem. In order to hange the 
program so that more emphasis 
IS placed on Improvmg writing 
skills, the grading policy of the 
TCWP mU~1 be changed . 

As lhe grading policy currently 
~tands, the Instructors offer 
comments and crmclsm rather 
than letter grades for each paper. 
Yet, letter grades are given at the 
mld - and end of quaner marks. 
The reason for this policy, I have 
been told . IS 50 that the students 
Will contmue LO try harder and 
Improve. Ideally, every student 
WIll leam to Wnte beuer Without 
the pressure of grades. 

Unfonunalely, there a.e many 

flaws in thiS gradmg theory. ftrst 
of all , the facl that grades arc 
given at the midterm and fmal 
period defeats the ennre purpose 
of not glvmg grades at other 
times. Why would instructors 
give gmdes at these two times 
and not during other periods? A 
typical answer to thiS IS that 
students Will then have an Idea 
of where they stand m the • 
course. This would be acceplable 
only if the student had an idea 
upon what crtlcna the mStrucLOrs 
based their grades. Some 
instru LOrs claim to grade on 
gradual improvement; but 
wouldn't this entice sludents to 
pend less time on Ihelr first 

drafts to conserve their effons for 
final revisions? Olher teachers 
grade students a cordmg to style. 
If the student follows the 
teacher' style, hiS or her grade 

will pr bably Improve. The 
mstructOr~ rationalize thiS by 
saying that sludents need to be 
exposed to ot her styles of 
writing However , Slnt:e most 
stude nts have already developed 
their own unique, and very 
pos51bly ohere nt, styles, why 
would the program atlempt to 
change the one coherent positive 
writing characteristic that the 
student an all hi or her own. 
II is the teacher's resp nsibility

Part II 

A socialist prescription for South Africa 
By GLENN SACKS 

T HE American left has completely Ignored the deep multi-ethmc and 
inter-tnbal hatred whIch exists 
In South Afnca. Contract to what 
Simplistic liberal rhetonc would 
have us believe South Afnca 
does not con51st Simply of whites 
and blacks. but also of Dutch 
English, Portuguese , Jndlans. ' 
Jdpanese. Chinese, Zulus, 
Xhosas, and many other mbal 
and ethni groups, many of 
whom hale each other JUSt as 
much as they hate the 

government. Conservative critics 
are correct when they poin~o 
the disastrous effects of 
independence on such Afric;an 
nations as Ethiopia , Zimbabwe , 
Nigeria , Zaire, and Uganda, 
where "national liberation" has 
brought only inter-tribal 
genOcide, repressive 
dictatorships, and increased 
poverty 

Amertcan liberals have also 
presented a biased and unfair 

picture of white South Africans. 
From what they say, the vast 
majority of the whites are 
faSCistic , racist, petty tyrants who 
want to subjugate and make 
miserable the non white 
population. 

False. Whire South Africa 
certainly has more than its share 
of fascists and fascist groups, 
most South African whites are 
not racist extremists but merely 
s ared bigots who cling to their 
unjust privileges because they see 
no other alternatives. 

In lieu of the white political 
CriSIS, It IS also important to 
recognize that there are no major 
black organizations In South 
Africa with a workable solution , 
ei ther. 

The bourgeois-nationalist 
African National Congress and 
has so far been a rallYing center 
for blacks. However, upon taking 
power, the ANC, which has 
garnered the total suppOrt of 
Amencan liberals. Will be exactly 
the same position that the 
current Botha regime is tn. 

With its proclaimed hberal 
democratic , capitalist program, 
the ANC will be no more able to 
ra ise the liVing slandards of the 
blacks than the current white 
regtme is. Indeed, If the ANC 
were to take power, it is more 
than likely that a multi-racial 
bloodbath would ensue. 

Frustrated wuh the inability of 
the ANC regime to raise living 
standards, blacks would point 
the blame at the still-entrenched 
white industrial system and take 
vengeance. White VIgilantes 
would return their VIOlence. The 
inter-tribal violence and blood-

letting which already plagues 
South Africa would most likely 
break out in full force . Like the 
Botha regime, under the ANC 
inter-tribal and inter-racial 
haued would be intensified by 
the sharp competition for the all 
too few jobs. 

one of this is to say. 
however, that South Africa is on 
the verge of a revolution. To the 
contrary, no matter how much 
the nonwhite majority hates the 
white regime , the guns are still m 

the hands of the whites. and 
most of the whites support the 
government, either 
wholeheartedly or, more 
commonly, as the lesser of twO 
eVils.

Should the current wave of 
VIOlence ever become tntolerable 
to the South African regime . the 
South Afm.an army could Simply 
surround the IsolateJ townShiPS, 
cut off all food and water and 
walt Hundreds of thousa~ds of 
Jeath. later, the blacks would be 
fo rced IntO submiSSion and the 
regime v,111 have bought peace 
fo r a generation. 

As hopeless as the current 
situation may seem, there is a 
solution . The solution is 
socialism. What is needed now 
in South Africa is not a black 
bourgeOis-na tionalist group like 
the ANC, but a multi-racial 
socialist party centered in lhe 
labor unions which could draw 
allegiance from all ethnic groups, 
inclu ding the whites. 

A South African socialist 
regime would nationalize the 
tremendous mineral wealth of 
South Africa, sell the minerals on 
the world market, and use the 
p rofi ts to b utld new tnd UStri es.

The government could bnng 
the wage levels of the skilled and 
non-sktlled laborers a slgmficant 
wage Increase Without fear of the 
boom-and-bust effect of 
capltaitsm 

It could use the mtneral 
profits , the readily available 
technology, and lhe technologlcal 
expertise of the skilled whl[es 10 
diversify the South Afncan 
economy in a way unimaginable 
under the present profit-motive 
system. It could use the rich land 
of South Africa to grow food for 
a hungry population , rather than 
cash crops for export 

It could end the needless cycle 
of violence which South Africa 
has cnminally mflicted upon ItS 
neighbors. It could form a 

cialist federa tion WIth I[S 
diamond-rIch and sparsely 
populated colony Namibia, and 
perhaps even hnk up With 011-
rich, revolutionary Angola. 

Most Imporrant, a South 
African planned economy could 
ease racial tensions by spreading 
the nation's wealth more or less 
equally among the various racial 
groups. White capitalism has 
and will continue to fall woefully 
in this task , this IS something 
which socialism has proven itself 
able to do in countries such as 
Cuba and Yugoslavia. 

Indeed, the prototype for this 
type of progam IS Yugoslavia. 
YugoslaVIa IS a SOCialist nation 
consisting of eight major ethniC 
groups. all of whom have hated 
and waged war upon each other for 
ce nturies 

However. dunng World War [[ 
a multi-raCial. communist 
partisan group Unified the 

various eth nlC groups and 
effectively fought the azi armies 
against overwhelmi ng odds. After 
the war, because of ItS SOCialist 
program, I[ was able to unify its 
vanous ethntcllles and 
su ce sfully reSist the Soviet 
Unton's attempts to make I[ a 
satehte state. 

Since then , YugoslaVIa, a Third 
World nation which was 95 
percent peasant farmers and 
which hand no mdustry when 
the Communists took power, has 
seen a dramatic rise in living 
standards. Indeed . between the 
years 1950 and 1965 the 
Yugoslavian gross national 
product rose at a rate second in 
the world only to that of Japan. 

While economic problems 
have come with the recent world 
recession , Yugoslavians enJoy a 
reasonably good standard of 
living, great personal freedoms , 
and many (though by no means 
all) political freedoms . In 
addition , each ethnic group has 
been given a large amount of 
sovereignty and independence 
within the larger republic. 

Problems remain , but socialism 
has been a huge success in 
Yugoslavia and it can work in 
the same way for South Africa. 

The strategies of all the current 
factions in South Africa, black or 
while, lead to a dead end. The 
South African government can 
only fall when black and white 
workers link up agamst their real 
enemy, which is nor the legal 
structure of apanheid , but the 
driving forces behind it. 
capitalism. This and only this 
can lead to a democratic South 
Africa where blacks and whites 
can live and govern themselves 
in peace , equality, and 
harmony. ~

work. For example, if a student 
receives "Overall, good work" as 
a comment, how ... he know if 
this represents of an "A" or "C" 
grade? Even the midtenn grades 
don't reflect the quahty of a 
student's work. 1 do not know of 
one instructor who doesn't admit 
to grading more conservatively 
during midterm conferences. 
What is the purpose of giving a 
grade that doesn't reflect a 
student's work? The instructor 
justifies this policy by saying it 
makes students work harder to 
improve. But to this I vehemently 
disa8lfe. 1 am going to work just 
as hard to maintain a high grade 
as I would rryi ng to raise a low 
grade. This deflation of grades 
comes as a shock when a 
student expectS something a little 
more representative of his or her 
work in a class. In fact, I am 
more likely not to work in a class 
in which I feel hoplessly stuck 
with a deflated grade. 

One possible solution would 
be to eliminate aU grades in the 
course, including midtenn 
evaluations and final grades. This 
would eliminate the hypocrisy of 
the few grading times. This 
however, is not feasible, because 
the average Third College 
freshman is urged to enroll in 
only 12 units of classes. If the 
TCWP were not to distribute 
grades. then students would not 
receive proper credit. Thus, their 
12 credits would be reduced to 
eight, and they would become 
part-time students. 

Another solution is to change 
the grading option to a passi no 
pass system. However, prior 
experience teUs me that students 
will then only do the minimum 
to achieve a passing grade of c-
or better. By my observations , the 
percentage of students who earn 
a grade less than C- is 
outstandingly low. What good is 
a writing class that requires only 
satisfactory work? 

This leaves one solution. A 
student has the right and need 
to know, via a uniform seale, his 
or her grade and standing in the 
class. The award of grades on 
papers and other assignments in 
the TCWP would allow a student 
to be aware of his or her 
progress and improvement. 
Moreover, instructors should be 
obhgated to give grades. as well 
as important comments, which 
represent the true quality of the 
paper. The journals and papers 
should be given predetermined 
weights in the grading process, 
which would aUow for fairer 
grading in proportion to the 
actual writing improvement 
involved. 

I have little doubt that this 
subject has been considered 
be lore . I hope that I have been 
able to shed some inSight into it 
that may improve the Third 
College Wming Program.

from his family'S San Ysidro

[WO hours each way. The 
commute would take forty 
minutes by car, but car 
maintenance , insurance. and 
parkrng are 100 expensive , said 
Castellanos. A northern 
extension of the trolley may 
reduce the commute to an hour 
each way. 

Carpools are nOt readily

come to UCSD from San Ysidro.

"The northern extension of the 
trolley may help get some 
students from the inner ciry to 
UCSD. Minonty high school 
students can take advantage of 
evening and weekend programs 
like Annual College Nighr and 
the Early AdmlsslOns Honor 
Program in which the high 
school students need to be at 

UCSD around three times a 
week," sa id Russell Murphy, 
Outreach Officer for the 
Educational Opportunity 
Program. 

'The rapid gro ..... th , without 
concurrent growth in staff and 
resourccs, has impactcd heavily 
on aU students, but most heavily 
on commuters who have larger 
,J~lnand on their tlme and utilize 
less monetary and staff support 
per student," reported the 
Commuter Life Committee in 
June 1985, under the direction of 

Beverly Varga . The report 
deemed com muters "the 
disadvantaged maJonty." 

"Some (born and bred San 
Diegansl may be tom by two 
worlds - the university in 
which they feel 'out of place' and 
'home' with family, 
neighborhood , and high school 
friends .. DiverSity of the 
commuter popuh!lon calls for 
diverse approache to meeting 
their needs," the report added . 

According to the statistical 
data from the Offtce of the 

Registrar in July 1984, 67 percent 
of all UCSD students were 
commuters, 36 percent of which 
lived With kin . 55 percent of all

Will be here at UCSD Jar the

all came around and , "Well, 
wtylr do you want to do?" And I 
said , "Oh, I don't know," bur just 
to pl.ease them I saId I would 
have liked to go to a umversity. 
They said , "Right, you're going to 
a university; we'll get the fonns

wouldn't get tn, so there was no 
need to wony. But I got in to the 
Australian National UniYersiry. 
Kalhy. What courses chd you 
take at the university? 
Ph)t I thought I'd take English 
and get really proficient in 
writing, (so 1 could) write my

didn't take English, but of course 
I had to take a CuD COI.I1"SC. One

absolutely loved anthropology, I 
reaDy got hooked on it. It's

major in anth ropology. But at the 
university we had t() take twO 
major , and so I also took

Kathy: What type of classes are' 
you taking here in San Diego? 
Phyl: I'm laking two anthropology 
classes (anthropology in myth 
and anOther that does include 
the Kwakiutl) and a Greek and 
Roman literature class. I find it 
tremendously interesting. The 
thing that I have had [rouble

Kathy; What do you think about 
the exchange program? 
Phyl: I came here vinually to 
study, bur I've been absolutely 
impressed with what's been done 
In the field of international 
relations. I feel like I've been 
given some intimation of . 
fellowship . I have found that rhis 
feeling (of peace) is strong here 
In San Diego, much stronger 
than in the universities 1 have 
attended before. I hear young 
people talk about their countries 
and end up hearing, "Oh, I'd 
love to go there !" Unless you 
actually have contact with people

Today, sea suppOrtS the interior 
of Australia because it brings 
water up by artesian bores They 
put thiS tube down 0 far. .. 
somellmes the water comes up 
boiling because it comes from 
such a depth. 

Of course, the aborigine tribes 
are no longer in their native 
state. They're all son of "semi-
detribalized" and there's a lot of 
conflict between them and the 
authorities. However, I assure 
you that the autorities do the 
very best for the aborigines. But, 
it's not always in the best 
possible way. 

I have friends tAm. whose 
stations (ranches) were measured 
16,000 square miles. It takes all 
day to drive from one end to the 
other. It's virtUally all desen, but 
they have these bores down and 
they run cattle. The bores empty 
into trenches and 

from other countries, you can't 
gel an understanding of them . 
So, I think that the International 
Gub and Centlr are marvelous 
things. They don't spare any 
effon, such as getting a host 
family for each student. 
Kathy. What exactly does a host 
family do? 
Phyl: These people give their 
time and homes for the benefit 
of the (exchange) students. I've 
checked around a lot by saying 
that I had the very best host 
family, and they (the other 
exchange students) all said, "No, 
you have not! No host famrly 
could have been better than 
mine ." The family could not do 
enough for me! They have taken 
me to see things in San Diego. 1 
came from my country not 
knowing anyone or anything. To 
step on foreign soil and have 
this wonderful host lady holding 
up a placard with my name on it 
made me feel at home right

staned lO do th ings out of sheer 
kindness. 
Kdlhy. TeU me more about your

PII,t When I married , 54 years 
ago, my husband had sIre,dy 
been prevtously married and he 
had been hvina in Ind ia under 
the British Raj for a number of 
years. His wife at the time chose 
not to be vaccinated , because in 
those days it was not mandatory 
to receive the inoculation. 
Consequently, she caught small 
pox and died. Well , she left him 
wah twO smaU toddlers. In the 
meantime, his parents had 
migrated down to Canberra, 
Australia, where I was. They lived 
very close to us, so our families 
became friends. I became friends 
With his twO daughters, who 
were qUite a bit younger than he , 
but only a few years younger 
than I When he came home, I 
was at the great age of l5 , I 
think, and we were m,lrrled

Kathy: What do you think of 
young people today? 
PhyI: People have asked me how 
1 find young people: AIe young 
people as good today as they 
were when I was young? I have 
great faith in them , because in 
my own experience the fact that 
I've been older than them, that 
there may have been thought of 
some generation gap, hasn't 
happened. They've accepted me 
as one of them, and I've been 
able to see what they think. I've 
been able to hear their problems, 
and to discuss them with tI:Ie 
young people. I think movements 
like the International Club are so 
useful , because young people 
come together and they talk 
about their counrnes. They talk 
about the problems they ftnd , 
and they find that the problems 
are similar back in their own 
co untry. I do belive that very 
many young people are 
dedicated to the pursuit of 
peace. 
Kathy: What are you doing with 
your free tum? 
Phyf; Well , I plan to go about 
and help out at the International 
Center, because I think it's such 
a wonderful idea. 
Kathy; What do you plan to do 
when you go back home? 
Phyl; Well, I have collected 14 
tapes of my husband's life Story 
(which we recorded whi le he 
was alive). He was a marvelous 
man. You see, he had seen cars 
ce me, airplanes, fast trains and 
electricity. He lived in India and 
he knew Gandhi . He was there 
during the Gandhi riots. That's 
why I went to the umversity in 
the first place , to write his 
memoirs. 

The Consul General here is 
sending me a film on Australia 
which I'm gOing to show at the 
International Club It's going to 
be open to the public , so 
perhaps some people from 
around here will actually orne 
and see it, 100. I think it's a good 
thing for people to know things 
about Austraha that pedlap they 
don't. Well , some people have 
said to me , "What made you 
come when you're over 707" I 
said, "I might have been Inspired 
by your president!" ~

An unfulfilling kegger 
By TROY CARDENAS 

Pablo sa t in a comer and watched in dismay. The freshmen were doing 
deformed cartwheels on th e lawn 
while some of the seasoned 
senIors were danCi ng with 
pineapple rings on their heads 
and snapping coeds' bras. The 
highlight of this pany was when 
one drunk man with a huge 
paunch took his shi rt off and 
began to play bongo drums on 
his stomach. Pablo watched the 
groupies swarm around the team 
athletes gathered around the keg. 

Disinterested in becoming a 
groupie, Pablo looked for the fat 
man with the hope that he could 
get him to play "Teenage Enema 
Nurse in Bondage" and infuse 
some lift into this boresome 
fiesta . 

"Hi' I haven't seen you around 
before . Are you new on the 
team?" a neo-punk coed giggled 
to Pablo between beer hiccoughs. 

"No, I'm a junior transfer from 
the University of Arizona," Pablo 
smiled and watched the grin on 
her face tum to a blank stare. 
She took a long sip of beer, in 
hopes of gaining enough courage 
to ask him another question . 

"Arizona , 1 hear that's a party 
school," she said , trying not to 
insult its academics. 

"Arizona!" shouted one of the 
athletes from the living room. 
"We're the paniers!' We own 

them!" 
"You tell 'em Bruno", his 

teammates cheered . 
And we're going to kick on 

them at the meet this weekend ," 
he said proudly as he put his 
ann around an orange-haired 
girl. 

Pablo lOok a huge gulp of beer 
and tried not to be too offended. 
But it was a hard thing to ask of 
hi mself at a dull pany that 
se rved Old Milwaukee in Coors 
kegs to try and get an extra buck 
out of the party-goers. Bruno put 
down his cup hoping that he 
and the girl would put pineapple 
rings on their heads and go off 
to the dance floor. However, 
Lady Luck was with him only 
half way that night. Pablo 
watched the girl walk around the 
crowd and stand in line at the 
bathrooms, leaving the guy 
behind . . 

"What a rad chick!" Bruno 
said as she disappeared in line. 

"She's hot for me, too, dude, 
- didn't you notice how she 
looked at me? I mean it was 
practically an open invitation, 
dude! "Wasn't it, buddy?" he 
said to Pablo. 

"By the way, dude, my name's 
Cam ." 

"Nice to meet you," Pablo said 
without volunteering his name. 
He was always amazed at how 
some guys interpreted a woman's 
glante. About tne only thing 
unique in the way she had

stared at Cam was that she had 
used both eyes. 

"So dude, you're from 
Arizona ," Cam said . "Which 
school do you like better?" 

Pablo thought about this one 
long and hard . He had always 
had bad results when he said he 
liked Arizona, so he decided lO

California," Pablo responded 
unobtrusively. 

Cam nodded his head 
knowingly and took another sip 
of beer. He .sat down next to 
Pablo and became serious. 

"00 you know the name of the 
chick who just walked oID" Cam 
asked, breathing heavily. 

"No, she didn't get to that. 
Why?" Pablo inquired. 

"Because dude, this is a team 
pany. As far as athletics go on 
this campus, we're it!" Cam 
laughed proudly. "111 give her 
something to remember," he said 
and looked down at his cup. 

Pablo hesitated to think what 
kind of a sexual experknce this 
guy was planning to offer her. 

"Cam, you're toO rad, dude ," 
Pablo said, imitating his 
inflection. "She'd be stoked for 
you. There she is. She just left 
the bathroom." 

Cam stood up quickly and 
eyed her across the room. He ' 
turned one last time to Pablo and 
slapped him on the shoulder. 

"Hey dude, it's been real! " 
Cam smiled and ran down the 
stairs after her. 

The next morning Pablo woke 
up with one of the worst 
hangovers he had ever had. He 
was feeling the kind of pain that 
only Old Milwaukee and 
Robeno's could give you. Later 
on in the afternoon , when he felt 
well enough to crawl out of bed , 
Pablo went over to his desk and 
opened up his chemistry book. 
Studying on any pan of a Friday 
or Saturday had always been 
against his religion, but after last 
night'S pany, he realized he 
would have to re-evaluate his 
position in life. Hell , he thought, 
he might even make it into 
medic;il school after all. ~

N EVER tell a man from England he needs the luck 0 ' the Irish , bur If 
things don't get better fo r UCSD 
men's soccer coach Derek 
Armstrong, he may be wearing 
Celtic green very , very soon. 

For the second game In a row. 
UCSD dominated play and for 
the second game In a row, UCSD 
lost, thIS llme at the hands of 
DIVISIOn [[ Cal Poly Pomona by 
the score of 3-0 . Although 
Armstrong was pleased . It was 

still an exercIse In frustration. 
"We dId very well but we JUSt 

hit a siTUation where lady luck 
has gone In the other direc[lon 
with the help of bad offICiating," 
said Armstrong. 

Not only bad officia ting, but 
also inJunes have seriously 
affected the team. "We've Just 
been deCImated by inJuries and 
II 'S something.we havC'(1't had 
to deal with in the past two 
years, so I guess now It'S our tum 
to suffer a bit ," said Armstrong. 

PatchIng things up has not 
been easy and UCSD's playoff 
picture is very precarious, and 
co uld hinge on the game this 
weekend WIth Division I USD. 
Claremont-Mudd, the other team 

fIghting for a playoff spm, has 
fo ur 10 scs. but UCSD's losses 
have come at the hand of 
DiVISion I and 11 opponents. (UC 
Irvine TWice , USU I, Chap man, . 
and Cal Polv Pomona), so the 
Tmons gam'e against the Toreros 

Defense name of game 
for women's soccer 
By CHARLES W ALoHANZ 

ITS been so easy for the women's soccer team. Going into the All-Cal tournament 
In Irvine last weekend, they had 
averaged over five goals In theIr 
fI rst nine games. In that same 
span they've only gIven up a 
total of three goals , TWO In the 
first game of the season 

The good news for the Tmons 
IS that theIr defense continued to 
domInate, and did not allow any 
goals In the five -team , round-
rob in tournament. The bad news 
IS that they also failed to score In 
three of their four games, and 
ended up WIth one win, three 
lles and a second-place finish . 

UCSD's four opponents In the 
tourrtament were UC Santa Cruz 
UC Irvine , UCLA and UC Davis ' 
with the only win coming agai~t 
UCLA 

Coach Leaney was forced this 
weekend to use some reserves 
due to injuries to three key 
players. Leading scorer Adrienne 
dark was "definitely missed ," as 
evIdenced by the two goals In 
four games. But defenders Toni 
Krumme and Susan Kramer were 
replaced WIth excellent play by 
Marisa Ortiz and Lisa Lubely 
The Injuries aUowed the reserves 
to play under pres!>ure, rather 
than only durIng blowouts. 
whIch should help the [earn 
down the stretch , aCcordIng [0 
Coach Leaney. 

"There's no other team of any 
rankmg In the state that 's gOt 
stats like that: Leaney said when 
describing hiS team's defense. 
The TrItons would have to self-
destruct at this POInt not to 

make the playoffs. They are 
ranked number one in the Far 
West RegIOn , and ha.cn 't lost 
since their 2-1 defeat to Division 
I Santa Barbara in the first game 
of the season . ll:il

At Bakersfield 
'UCSD 
places 
second 
By lAURA DOUGlAS 

Bakersfield may not be a 
thriving metropolis, but for fast 
running it is the place to go . At 
least that's what the UCSD 
women's cross-country team 
would say after it took second 
place at the Road Runner 
Invitational in Bakersfield last 
SaTUrday, October 4, in which 
every member of the team ran 
her personal best time for a five-
kilometer course . 

"It was a fast, flat course, that's 
all I have to say," said Cassy 
Shepperd, number six runner at 
UCSD. 

While the men 's team was in 
Berkeley for the All-Cal meet, the 
women's team battled the dry 
heat and the TUmbleweeds in 
Bakersfield . 

"I didn't mind the heat at all: 
said team member Andrea 
Veatch. "I'm from a small town 
east of Bakersfield , so I felt right 
at home in the heat and dry 
weather. I only wish my mom 
could have seen the race." 

Cal Scale Bakersfield's 
cheerleaders were out for the 
exciting event, complete with 
pompons and running cheers. 
Bakersfield made a good 
shOWIng by coming first in the 
team competillon , bur Cal State 
los Angeles' top twO runners 
dominated the race by capturing 
both first and second place. 

First-place finisher Sllvla 
Mosqueda came in more than a 
minute ahead of the next 
runnmer, her own teammate , 
with a time of 16: lO. This was 

'S more than a minute faster than 
::: her first-place time last week at 
..., the SDSU Aztec Invitational in 

Marisa OrtiZ

Cal State Los Angeles did not 

have a complete team, however,

X-country 
Continued from page 12 
so it couldn't caprure a team title , 
This opened the way for Cal 
State Bakerfsfie1d to take first 
place, with 20 pOints, and UCSD 
to take second, with a total of 45 
points. UCSD was the fastest 
Division UI team at the 
invitational. 

First for UCSD, and fourth 
overall was Sabrina Jensen, with 
a time of 17:52, who was 
followed by Gisele English in 
thirteenth place, with a time of 
18:57. Third for UCSD, and 
seventeenth overall was Andrea 
Veatch, witn a time 19:14. Just a 

few seconds behind at 19: 17, 
and eighteenth overall was 
Nicole Rainey. 

"I'm bouncing off the walls," 
said Rainey. "My goal for the 
whole season was to run under 
20:00, but this was an 
exceptionally flat course." 

In fifth place for UCSD, and 
twenty-seventh overall, with a 
time of 20:20, was freshman 
Corry Cam~ll, in her first race 
of the season. 

"I had a great time out there : 
said Campbell. "No pun 
intended. I am so glad we are 
running together now; we've 
really got a lot of tealTl unity and 
team spirit. It was an eXCiting 
first race." ~ 

Mets 
Continued from page 12 
baseman Keith Hernandez, along 
with third baseman Ray Knight 
to proVide a steadying influence 
during tight situanons. Astro 
veterans Davey Lopes, Phil 
Gamer, and Jose Cruz are clutch 
performers, but other than 
Gamer, their exuberence level is 
inconsistent. 

HITTING: no real comparison 
here, the Mets lead the league in 
team batting average, RBI's , hits. 
runscored , and were 2nd in 
home run totals. Their first seven 
batters are all threats, as is their 

bench . compared to the Aslros. 
who have little depth and are 
weak after the sixth batter leaves 
the plate . 

BAllPARKS: The Astrodome 
will severly limit the Mets power 
outage. and Shea Stadium fan 
behavior will scare the pants off 
of small-town boys like Astro 
reliever Charlie Derfeld . Call this 
even . .. 

DEFENSE: Slight edge to the 
Astros here, mostly because they 
know how to play the Astrodome 
and the Mets don 't. 

PREDICTION: The Mets in 6, 
as history will not absolve the 
Astros. ~ 

Astros 
Continued from page 12 

still have the offensive edge. 
They lead the league in team 
baning and have great clutch 
hitters in Keith Hernandez and 
Gary Carter, especially when the 
world is watching. 

The bench has played an 
important role for the Astros this 
season , and this may continue 
during the series. 

1 also believe tha t Houston has 
a defensive advantage. Up the 
middle they are strong with 
Ashby at catcher, Doran at 
second, Reynolds at short and 
Hatcher in center. 

The Astros are no fluke and 
should challenge News York; 
they've proven that they can play 
under pressure. Of the twelve 
games played against the MelS 
this season, they've won five, so 
this certianly is no mi smatch. 
The starting pitching of New 
York , however, may be 100 
strong. My pick is the Mels in 
!>even . ~ 

Polo 
goes 
4-1 
By BRIAN ITOW 

LAST Thursday, the UCSD water polo travelled up the coast to tranquil northern 
California. They were there to 
play in th e Nor Cal, a 
tournament featuring some of the 
nations' most dominant teams. 
By Sunday, the tranquility of the 
Bay Area had disappeared and 
the Tritons had come home with 
a 4-1 record . 

After easily winning a rune-up 
match with Dominican CoUege 
19-1 Thursday eveni ng, UCSD 
was ready to face formidable 
competition in the Nor Cal. 

The Tritons opened the 
tournament with an impressive 
8-3 win over Santa Clara 
Un iversity as they prepared for 
what was to be their toughest 
match of the tournament - the 
eighth ranked Fresno State 
Bulldogs. 

UCSD coach Denny Harper 
seemed like a prophet when he 
sta ted "We knew we were in for 
a good match." That it was -
and much more . The Tritons had 
entered the match with an even 

serie~ record of 3-3-1 versus the 
Bulldogs a very large team with a 
large number of scholarship 
players. Going into the closing 
seconds of the game the two 
teams were tied at seven when 
Chris Carrillo mi ssed a high . 
percentage shot in front of the 
Fresno goal. Thus, the game 
went into overtime. In ovenime , 
the Bulldogs score fWO quick 
goals and held on to win 9-7. 

After [heir tough loss, [he 
Tritons were flat for [he 
remainder of the tournament. 
Still, they were able to sli p by Air 
Force 6-5 and th e University of 
[he Pacific 7-6 to fini sh a 
successful road Iri p. 

Still , only eight teams are 
invited to the NCAA 
Championship tournament so 
[he Tritons are looking forward 
to haVIng a chance to repeat a 
Nallonal Invi taitional 
Tournament Champions. 

The team is also looking 
forward to ils big match wi th [he 
Universiry of Southern California 
TrOjans on Salurday, October 11 
at 2:30. [J

INTRAMURAL FlAG 
FOOTBALL PREVIEW 

Here I am dire t from the l\:CAA 
onl'enllon on drug abusc and Illegal 

recrumng vlOlallons Bo)' did 1 learn a 
lot. Did you know that I f you smoke the 
Illegal weed It can be detected up to one 
month dfter you have used it Gee I 
wonder who goes one wh Ie month 
without lighting up] Even more 
intere tlng I the fact that the use of 
cocaine can be dc.rected for three 
months after It'S use. 

ThiS means all of you better keep you 
noses and your lungs clean The rumor 
has It that mandatory drug testing Will 
be in tituted for 1M athletes whose 
teams qualify for 1M football playoffs 
The 1M Czars have eliminated many 1M 
teams In the past for illegal players, but 
for Illegal drugs] Times they are a 
changlng

' 
I guess all those who don't 

qualify for the playofTs may come out 
the real winner . 
MEN'S AM 

Dynasty is the key word here. As In 
York Hum Club. As 10 'AAA' football 
champions for three out of the last four 
years. My goodness can't anybody beat 
a team with an old man for a 
quarterback. I gucss it helps to surround 
yourself with perennial All-1M wide 
receivers 'Flyboy' Chris Ferrez and 
Doug Roche. The only two teams who 
looked to give York a run for the money 
both lost their season openers. 
Chocolate City looked like they were 
ready to dethrone the champs. 
BasicaUy, the whole team returned and 
they have been practicing aU summer 
long to refine their skills. I guess their 
loss means practice doesn 't make for 
perfect. The Herd went out and 
recruited the best team that a Dallas 
boy's money could buy Captain Mequet 
went out and took aU the stars ofT of aU 
of last year's teams to form thiS group of 
studs. Seems that they forgot one thing 
Pre -season predictlons don't win 
games. They also lost their first game to 
an up and coming Beachheads squad. 

ow there's a team for you. BasebaU 
coach Lyle Yate's finest can almost play 
football better than baseball . At least that 
is what Lyle tells me. 
Budman's Preseason Prediction: Butt

COED 
This diVISion could he a runaway It 

looks like Team Desparados and 
everyone else. ThiS tram IS loaded With 
talent But talent IS not usually what 
WinS games for these ,Jnlmals. The 
name of the game for the De~perados IS 
'mllmidation'. These guys and gals are 
so rough they taught the Oakland 
Raiders how to play dirty (Yes folks . h ' 
Still the Oakland Raiders to yours truly). 

If anyone IS gOing to have a chance 
agaInst the Desperados it could be the 
rerum of Hot Fudge. Once a Dynasty at 
UCSD. [he), have fallen on rough times 
and poor leadership m past years. ThiS 
year they look read)' to put It together 
5th and Inches has a chance but time IS 
not on your Side. 
Budman's Prediction: Roche watters 
over Team Desparados. 

MEN'S AA 
ThIS IS a diVISion m transition. The 

loss of top teams by real graduation and 
graduation to 'AAA' always makes for a 
new and interesting season . 
Unfortunately one top 'M ' team did not 
move up to the 'AAA' level. The 
defendmg champIOns from last year, 
Phuck It Without Wood, rerum almost 
intact. Noth Ing worse than a 
sandbagger! I'm sure I echo aU 'M' 
teams In hoping that "the bird of 
paradise puts a hole in your footbaU". 

On to the real 'M ' football teams. 
Leading the pack for the coveted 
Banana Bowl title are two fratemi ty 
teams. ZBT led by talented Kevin 
Simon, and Wet Inner Phis (P hi Deltas) 
led by dynamo Eddie Tael could meet 
for TWO titles this year Each team has 
the big lme, the speedy wideouts and 
that one intangible, good lookmg 
girlfriends. 
Teams to watch for: 
Last chance - Likes to run up scores. 
La Machine - One half of the Matz 
tandem IS gone . 
Sneak It m - Big loss m last year's 'A' 
fmal Will inspire . 
Bullwinkle's Boner - Always plays 
hard . 
MEN'S 'A' 

As always, thIS diVIsion is a 
nightmare for a mystic like myself. 
What I usually do is give a list of teams 
who have played Men's 'A' football the 
longest and why they have never 
smelled the sweamess of glory.

BUD LIGHT TEAM OF THE WEEK 
The first of our coveted Bud Light Team of the week awards goes to 

a bunch of med-school studems from a team called Lonely Huns. 
These Docs-to-be-overpowered a tough FRIGIDAIRE team 22-8. 
Through a barrage of both long and short range passes, quanerback 
Brett Stompro was able to dissect the always intimidating defense of 
FRIGIDAIRE. The HEARTS also posess three of the finest receivers 
anywhere . Preston Neumayer, Greg Paige, and Brian Moore all 
demonstrated the soft hands necessary for surgery-nothing was 
dropped. Fierce line play was also an imegral pan of the Victory. 
Standouts on the line were Francisco Garcia and Mike Basco. 

When asked what ignited them to their awesome victory, many of 
the team members replied that they begin every game with the goal of 
a Bud Light victory - sounds like a piece of good advice for you 1M 
teams that staned on a less higher note.

The American-made film "A Great Wall", filmed in the People's 

Republic of China, is a moving, "must-see movie," because it paints a very 
true picture of the reunion of two families after a 30-year separation. One 
of the topics "A Great Wall" deals with is the different aspects of family 
upbringing due to vastly different cultural influences. Paul Wang, who in 
real life is a naturalized American citizen from Beijing, co-wrote, directed, 
and starred in this movie. 

This film offers a sad but true glimpse of the future of the youth in 
communist China which may be the reason why "A Great Wall" has not 
been viewed by the general public in China. Lili, Leo's niece, plans for and 
awaits the national college entrance examination, a test which supposedly 
determines a person's entire future. Disenchantment with the present and 
a bleak outlook on the future are seen in "upper class" Lili and in her 
tentative boyfriend Liu, a boy of lesser means. Liu is also studying for the 
college entrance exam, which he has failed before. 

While they study together, each reveals lifelong dream" which show a 
great longing for the West. As sadly implied in "A Great Wall" and 
unfortunately true in the real life of the two, only Lili would be able to 
realize her dream, because she has American relatives who could help her 
further her education in America. 

In addition to these two pertinent topics, which many Chinese and 
American-Chinese are facing today, this movie also offers beautiful 
displays of the ancient arts of tai chi and jing yuen da gu (the art of 
storytelling in song), scenic views of Beijing, and an exciting ping-pong 
~me which pits East aga.inst W~st. "A 0eat ~all," which is ~hown in 
Mandarin and English (Wlth Enghsh subntles), 1S currently runmng a t the 
Guild Theatre. For more information, 295-2000.

A movie of a lesser god 

Phil: How many times have 
I seen this movie? Children of a 
Lesser God is a rip-off of at 
least three movies that I can 
remember. The most obvious 
is The Other Side of the 
Mountain, in which a 
handsome and persistent 
young man breaks through to 
a beautiful handicapped girl, 
and they fall in love. In The 
Other Side, the girl was 
paralyzed. 

In Lesser God, Mariee 
Matline, Sara, is deaf. William 
Hurt plays her lover James, a 
teacher of the deaf, in a role 
for which Nick Nolte (the 
man with the ultimate teacher 
face, but with less talent) 
would have been better 
suited. 

Gita: Lesser Gxl begins by 
presenting a school teacher 
dedicated to his students. 
Everything moves along fine 
and dandy: James gets setded 
at the deaf school, does some 
brilliant teaching moves on 
his students ... then, one day, 
he sees her. The picture 
switches from his fascinated 
stare to her angry thrashing 
about, from his enraptured 
face to her throwing pots and 
pans, from his devoted eyes to 
her gutter-mouthed hands. 

Phil: Of course, they fall in 
love, move in together, and 
J ames takes it as his calling 

by phil maclovem and pta reddy 

from God (presumably the 
lesser one) to teach her to 
speak. They have tumultuous 
arguments, ones that I feel 
would have more force if I 
could read sign language. 
True, Matlin does an 
admirable job using her face 
and speeding hands to express 
her emotions, but it is sort of 
like watching a movie with the 
sound off. 

We have' to rely on James' 

translatiOns, which do not 
always carry the same impact. 
You have to piece together his 
words with what you 
remember of her emotions. 
Some of the 'time he does not 
translate, and the audience is 
left to wonder what she said. 

Gita: Subtitles might have 
been more effective in that 
department, but director 
Randa Haines reveals her 
television background 

through too many close-ups, 
presumably used to intensify 
the "unspoken" emotion. 
Less emotion might have 
worked better for the movie 
as a whole, but it definitely 
furthers the love story - a 
great hokey one, I think . 

Phil: Stupid is a more 
accurate description. The 
glassy stares are endless -
especially William Hurt's. 

Gita: Well, true. But that is 
the focus of the movie, isn't it? 
The movie shifts focus from 
the teacher-student bit to the 
teacher-lover bit, doesn't it? 

This becomes one of those 
project movies. He finds her, 
he seeks to rebuild her, make 
her better than she was before. 

Phil: We have the 
technology . . . to make a 
better movie . The deafness is 
used as a gimmick in the hope 
of winning some sort of 
condolence Oscar. It could 
have been any handicap, but I 
think all of the good ones ha ve 
been done. The movie could 
have been done better without 
any handicap, and been a 
deeper, if unoriginal, love 
story. The deafness gets in the 
way. 

Gita: In the way of what? 
Lesser God was originally a 
play, one that must have made 
better use of the intriguing 
title. The idea of a "lesser" 
creater / creation is never 
addressed, because the movie 
shifts too quickly from the 
deaf children to the deaf 
"project. " There is no 
balance. But, this mush is 
worth a lot of Kleenex. 

Children of a Lesser God is 
currently being shown at the 
Mann Lorna and Pacific 
Cinerama theatres.

Knocked Out Loaded proves 
that it is still possible for an 
artist to make great records 
after 25 years in the business. 
Bob Dylan's 31st album, 
released this past August, may 
not possess songs with the 
traditional acoustic guitar and 
harmonica sound that created 
his fame, but it does have a 

made up for by the music ofT. 
Bone Burnett and Dylan on 
guitar, and AI Kooper on 
keyboards, combining for a 
rock 'n' roll sound matching 
that of the Blonde on Blonde 
era. 

"They Killed Him," written 
by longtime friend Kris 

Kristoferson, is definitely one 
of the most moving pieces 
sung by Dylan since his folk 
days . A horn section, along 
with a choir of 15 children 
added to Dylan and the Girls, 
make this mellow, gospel-type 
tune an anthem crying out to 
society for the "holy men" 
killed, such as Gandhi, Martin 
Luther King, Jr . and Jesus 
Christ. 

The three songs that finish 
off Side One, "Driftin' Too 
Far From Shore," "Precious 

perils of relationships. 
" Precious Memories, " a 
traditional song with a new 
calypso- like arrangement, 
reveals Dylan in an almost 
mournful, retrospective style 
as he sings, Precious memories, 
how they linger, how they ever 
flood my soul. In the stillness of 
the midnight, precious sacred 
scenes unfold. 

Side Two begins with 
"Brownsville Girl," a definite 
candidate to be considered as 

record in revue 
by mark pinkus 

Memories," and "Maybe a classic Dylan song. Written 
Someday," are all solid, both in the vein of " Like a Rolling 
musically and lyrically . Stone," Dylan uses the first 
"Driftin'" offers the first taste person as he sings for eleven 
ofwhatisonDylan'smindas minutes in an almost 
he bemoans a girl to whom he storytelling voice about 
gave all he had, only to have various events occurring with 
her drift away. The song is not him and /or a girlfriend. Near 
to be mistaken for a the end of the song, he boldly 
meaningless love song, states, I don't have any regretS. 
because the driving beat set by They can talk about me plenty 
Rolling Stones guitarist Ron after I'm gone, erasing the 
Wo~ takes you through the shattering concept that Dylan 

might have done things 
differently had he been given 
the chance. 

"Got My Mind Made Up," 
co-written with Tom Petty 
and featuring the Heart-
breakers as the musicians, is 
the only song currently 
receiving radio playas a result 
of its easily digested, steady 
beat sound. The song picks up 
where the past one left off by 
staring, Don't etJeT try CO change 
me, I've been in this thing too 
long, reaffirming his personal 
contentment. 

Dylan closes off the album 
with "Under Your Spell," a 
highly reflective song 
featuring Eurythmic guitarist 
Dave Stewart. Dylan concedes 
that he was left "knocked out 
and loaded" by the end of a 
romance, but realizes he will 
survive. The title of the song, 
as most of the album, points 
out to the listener that the 
freewheelin' Bob Dylan of 
yesteryear is now more under 
the control of others; yet, his 
words and music remain his. 
Dylan has managed to survive 
a quarter of a century so far , 
and Knocked Out Loaded 
shows no signs of his letting 
up. 

new style of its own which ,----------------------------------------------
leaves the listener, as the title 
states, knocked out and 
loaded. The album, which was 
accompanied by a U.S. 
summer tour, has placed 
Dylan back into the spotlight 
at a level he has not 
experienced for more than a 
decade. 

Knocked Out Loaded leaves 
one confused as to what 
exactly is Dylan's style of 
music in the Eighties. The 
album begins with a dance 
tune covered with driving 
guitars, and concludes with a 
slow, gospel-sounding song, 
with just about everything else 
in between. This, Dylan's 
sixth album of the decade (not 
including the five-record 
collection Biograph), stands 
above the others as a complete 
album, containing the basics 
from each previous one and 
combining them into a 
successful and original blend 
of music. 

All eight tracks on the 
album are filled not only with 
Dylan's vocals, but also are 
accompanied by the gospel-
sounding sextt!t Highway 
Blues Girls. The powerful 
sound given by female back-
up singers originated on the 
born-again Christian albums 
Saved and Shot of l...cNe in the 
early Eighties, and was 
completely abandoned in 
1983 on Infidels. Empire 
Burlesque, of 1985, experi-
mented with the sound of the 
Highway Blues Girls on just 
two songs, and this time 
around, Dylan went all out by 
employing them not only for 
the album but also for the 
concert tour. 

Lyrics, which have always 
been the essence of Dylan's 
work, are up to his usual 
standards, yet only two songs 
were solely written by the man 
who is often referred to as the 
best songwriter ever. The 
album opens up with Herman 
Parker, Jr . and Kris 
Kristoferson songs; it is a very 
rare occurrence to hear Dylan 
recording other artists' songs. 
The Parker song, "You 
Wanna Ramble," is the 
weakest lyric-wise, but it is

In its quest for "non-boring 
radio," UCSD's radio station , 
KSDT, slices the airwaves 
with new music in an 
otherwise mundane market. 
KSDT, which is basically 
student-run on a volunteer 
basis, began about 17 years 
ago. Being involved in KSDT 
is an excellent opportunity to 
gain valuable experience in 

radio, because it operates in a 
highly professional manner. It 
is part of the UC radio 
network. 

KSDT is funded by the A.S. 
and by its own KSDT party 
packages. Due to KSDT's 
large selection of music, its 
party package, which consists 
of a mobile deejay unit with 
two deejays atld an engineer, 

plays five hours of an 
assortment of music, 
depending on preference. 
KSDT will play for student 
organizations, weddings, 
dances or other activities for 
$100, and charges $150 for 
last-minute calls. 

KSDT hits the airwaves 
with a variety of alternative 
music. It does not play Top 40 

or music regularly heard on 
other radio stations. 91 X's 
playlist is KSDT's blacklist. 
Groups such as Virgin Prunes, 
Kill Ugly Pop, The Smiths, 
Steel Pulse, and the Dead 
Milkmen are a few heard over 
KSDT. 

Deej~ys at KSDT must play 
a mix of all different music

KSDT 
Continued from page 6 
types on their shows. KSDT 
also has feature plays, in 
which the best of all new 
music is highlighted. This 
means one-fourth to one-
third of its airtime is devoted 
to new funk, reggae, punk, 
blues, country and folk tunes; 
the rest of the music played is 
what the deejay wants and 
what is requested. 

KSDT isn't all music. There 
is also news at noon and at 6 
pm, on-air interviews with 
different people and groups , 
public service announce-
ments, and any other mayhem 
that can be conjured up. 
Anyone can be a part of 
KSDT, in any of its 
departments, which include 
music, personnel, publicity, 
promotion, production, 
engineering, news and 
management. 

Becoming a deejay atKSDT 
takes longer than any other 
position because it involves 
training from the Music 
Department, learning to use 
equipment and on-air training 
of voice and production. A 
prospective deejay must work 
in another department for a 
quarter and make an audition 
tape. The first step for any 
position at the radio station is 
orientation, which took place 
October 7 this year, but a 
student can join KSDT at any 
time. 

Staff members pay $5 per 
quarter and have the right to 

vote on station issues, 
including revising the 
constitution, electing non-
student members, approving 
managers and ilssistant 
directors, buying equipment, 
investing money in promo-
tionals, editorial issues and 
discipline. 

A problem KSDT finds 
quite irritating is that it cannot 
broaden its listening audience 
much further than the 
campus. Since KSDT is a 
campus station, it broadcasts 
with an educational license. In 
1972, KSDT put an 
application in to the FCC to 
broadcast on an open FM 
frequency, but was denied due 
to the positioning of its tower, 
which was not up to FCC 
standards. Now, KSDT is 
concentrating on being 
received through cable hook-
up. KSDT can be received off 
campus in stereo over the 
television via a cable hook-up 
from Southwestern or Cox 
cable companies. 

KSDT evokes an air of 
profeSSionalism mixed with 
the bizarre, offering 
something for everyone and 
plenty of new music. This 
year, it is planning to offer 
more feature plays and 
giveaways (of albums and 
concert tickets) and by next 
week, it will be playing 24 
hours a day, seven days a 
week. 

KSDT can be heard on 95.7 
FM cable or 540 AM at the 
Revelle, Muir, and Third 
dorms from 6 am to 3 am. 
KSDT's request line is 534-
4225, and its business line is 
534-3673.

VOLUNTEERING AT UCSD 

The Volunteer Connection at UC D 
(VCUCSD) would like to invite Warren 
students to join us in our ongOing dfon 
to improve student participation in 
volunteer work in San Diego. The 
V UC D is a student organization , or 
teeri ng ommittee, whic h seeks to 

in pire and faci litate a minimum of350 
undergraduate and graduate student 
to volunteer approximately 3 hours per 
week, per quarter, each year, to 
community work related to poverty and 
ed ucation . The hos ts fo r uch 
voluntee r are the an Diego Unified 

hool District and about 60 of the 
area's nonprofi t organizations. 

The VCUC D represe nts a n 
exce llent opportunity for UCSD 
students to connect with the people of 
an Diego. UCSD students could be 

tutors , counselors, and role models for 
an Diego youth, as well as provide 

needed social welfare services to the 
San Diego and Tijuana poor. With your 
support , we can help alleviate the 
problems associated with poverty and 
increaSing drop-out rate in our 
econdary and junior high schools. 

Responding to the growing desire 
and enormous potential of the UCSD 
student body to volunteer in local 
community service projects, the 
VCUCSD began in the summer as an 
ad-hoc committee of students working 
closely with Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Affairs, Tom Tucker, 
and Committee on University--
Community Services head , Bob Choate . 
We believe there is more to a college 
edu c ation than ac ademi c s . 
Volunteering is a way to gain valuable 
experience and sa ti sfaction In helping 
our adopted home of San Diego. 

Currently, the VCUC D is planning a 
volunteer Awa reness Day on November 
12, from lOam to 2pm, in front of the 
Student Ce nter. If you are interested in 
helping us and an Diego, please 
contact Ellen Caprio at 534-0540, or 
leave a message in the Student Center, 
Code B-023, A-2 (in the EDNA 
mailboxes). Thank you!
