UC  SYSTEM

Napolitano 
Announces 
Scholarship 
Allocation
The UC president says 
$5 million will support 
undocumented students 
under the DREAM Act. 
BY  justi n e  liang  contributing  writer

UC President Janet Napolitano 
announced last Wednesday that the 
UC system would allocate $5 million 
for financial aid and counseling for 
undocumented students.

This funding — coupled with the 
California DREAM Act, which passed 
in 2011 — aims to aid undocument-
ed students, as they are not eligible 
for federal financial aid. While the 
DREAM Act has 
not yet passed fed-
erally, California 
has implemented its 
own DREAM Act, 
according to the 
UC admissions website, which allows 
undocumented students to qualify for 
institutional and state aid and exempts 
them from paying nonresident supple-
mental tuition.

After Napolitano’s appointment, 
UC students protested largely due to 
her prior appointment as U.S. Secretary 
of Homeland Security. UCSD was the 
third university with a vote of no-con-
fidence prior to Napolitano’s appoint-
ment as UC president. 

“[It] was not about her being 
the first UC female president; it was 
about her background as former U.S. 
Secretary of Homeland Security,” A.S. 
President Andy Buselt said.

One of the largest groups of pro-
testors is the undocumented student 
coalition. The UC system has an esti-
mated 900 undocumented students, 
according to a figure from the Los 
Angeles Times, some of who rallied 
in organizations and coalitions against 
Napolitano’s appointment. Protestors 
argued that during her term as U.S. 
Secretary of Homeland Security, 
Napolitano oversaw a record number 
of 2 million deportations, according to 
the Washington Times.  

According to Buselt, Napolitano’s 
decision is perhaps a result of stu-
dent coalitions, who reportedly met 
with Napolitano the second day of her 
appointment as UC president. 

“I feel [the] $5 million was a direct 
result of student power,” Buselt said.” 

The funds for the financial aid will 
come from the Office of the President 
and will be distributed equally among 
the UC campuses. While it is not yet 
specified how these funds are distrib-
uted, there will be a conference with 
undocumented coalitions to make the 
decision, which will be clarified during 
the next Regents meeting Nov. 12–14.

Several UC campuses, such as 
UCLA and UC Berkeley, already have 
resource centers and opportunities for 
undocumented students, and it is not 
the first time that the UC system has 
provided support for these students. 

“This is a great first step, and I’m 
eager to see its effect,” Buselt said.

UCTV LAUNCHES NEW UCSD
LIBRARY TELEVISION CHANNEL
The channel will provide virtual access to the library’s content 
and will be available through YouTube and iTunes University.

T he UCSD Library launched a new televi-sion channel last week that will focus on the center’s various activities and events. 
This channel — created in partnership with 
the UC television station — aims to attract 
the attention of viewers by providing virtual 
access to the library’s content.   

UCTV — one of the founding EDU part-
ners of YouTube — is an award-winning 
television station, a video playlist that hosts 
educational videos for students and the educa-
tional content provider of iTunesU, an online 
database of course material for students. 
Together, UCTV’s videos receive 49 million 

views, while its iTunes content receives 10 to 
15 million views and downloads per month. 
The station aims to cover developments in 
education, research and technology through-
out the entire UC system.

Through UCTV’s relationship with UCSD, 
the Geisel Library has the capacity to broad-
cast its content to millions of viewers via the 
Library Channel — which is available on most 
local cable TV channels, YouTube, iTunes or 
the UCTV website.  

The channel currently features footage 
from the recent Dinner in the Library event 
that highlighted author Jay Parini and his

Large Grant Will Fund New Stem Cell Center
HEALTH

The $100 million grant will also help expand research operations at UCSD.

UCSD announced a $100 million 
donation last week that will fund 
the creation of a new Sanford Stem 
Cell Clinical Center. Seventy-seven-
year-old billionaire philanthropist T. 
Denny Sanford donated the money 
hoping to begin a project which aims 
to develop cutting-edge treatments 
using stem cells.

The Sanford Stem Cell Clinical 
Center will expand on existing stem 
cell research facilities at UCSD; most 

importantly, it will allow researchers 
to conduct clinical trials, or experi-
mental treatments, on patients. The 
project, called  “collaboratory” by its 
creators, will bring together scientists 
from UCSD, the Sanford-Burnham 
Medical Research Institute, the J. 
Craig Venter Institute and many 
other research facilities in the San 
Diego area for the purpose of advanc-
ing stem cell therapy.

Director of the UC San Diego Stem 
Cell Program Lawrence Goldstein 
has emphasized the importance the 

upcoming clinical trials will hold to 
stem cell research.

“We have made profound prog-
ress in understanding the basic 
nature and abilities of stem cells,” 
Goldstein said in a UCSD News 
Center press release on Monday. 
“We know a great deal about how 
they work and differentiate and, in a 
number of cases, how to make them 
become the kinds of cells we think 
we need. Now we have to put that

FLEETING THOUGHTS By Irene Chiang

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk

UCSD cosmochemists recently 
answered the long-standing ques-
tion of why the Earth’s crust and 
asteroid’s oxygen ratio chemical 
composition differ, after being pre-
sented with the problem for over 40 
years when a meteorite first entered 
the Earth’s atmosphere over Pueblito 
de Allende, Mexico. 

What scientists in UCSD chemis-
try professor Mark Thiemens’ Stable 
Isotope Lab discovered is that these 
meteorites maintained a 1:1 ratio 
of slightly heavier oxygen atoms, 
oxygen-17 and oxygen-18. This is 
comparable to Earth’s crust, which 
maintains a 2:1 ratio, with the larg-
er amount belonging to the typical 
oxygen weight at oxygen-16. UCSD 
Assistant Project Scientist Subrata 
Chakraborty, Ph.D., who authored 
the recent report, was interested in 
this subtle difference and its poten-
tial to help answer questions about 
how objects were formed in the 
beginning of time.

“We [at the lab] are so crazy about 
this topic, and people ask why we need 
to know this,” Chakraborty said. “We 
need to know because we have to have 
a terrestrial planet full of rocks. Every 
rock is [silicon dioxide] and some 
other minerals. Rocks are full of oxy-
gen. This one element is so abundant, 
but varies greatly from Earth to space.”

According to Chakraborty, under-
standing begins with knowledge of 
ozone chemistry. Although the Earth’s 
crust maintains a 2:1 ratio of oxygen 
isotopes, the ratio for the ozone layer is 
1:1, similar to that of asteroids. 

In researching the ozone chemis-
try,  principal investigator Thiemens 
revealed a chemical process that allows 
atmospheric oxygen to not necessarily 

have a preference on its adopted iso-
tope forms. When O2 combines with 
a lone oxygen molecule to form O3, 
or ozone, it achieves an excited energy 
state and can exist in three forms: 
O-16:O-16:O-16, O-16:O-16:O-17 and 
O-16:O-17:O-17. The first version of 
ozone is symmetric and is intuitively 
preferred, although Thiemens realized 
that ozone is not governed symmetri-
cally, and can prefer the latter two 
molecules just as readily.

Chakraborty and his lab recreated 
the process of forming asteroids to 
then answer the question of why the 
ratios in asteroids and in the earth’s 
crust differ, by placing hydrogen, oxy-
gen and silicon inside a small reaction 
chamber. Flash heated with UV rays, 

the atoms turned to the gaseous phase 
and began coagulating to form rocks. 
These rocks — just like extraterrestrial 
asteroids — also had a 1:1 ratio of oxy-
gen atoms. 

With the knowledge of how the 
earliest asteroids were formed, Subatra 
and other cosmochemists hope to 
become more informed on how Earth 
and other celestial bodies were created.

“We were satisfied,” Chakraborty 
said regarding his research, “We thrive 
for new science; that’s the thing we do.”

Last night’s A.S. meeting was sur-
prisingly short, but I soon learned 
that this was not without reason. It 
seems that A.S. Council can work 
much more efficiently with a retreat 
scheduled for later that night. Can 
there please be A.S. retreats every 
Wednesday?

To begin with, Emalie Chandras 
was appointed as a new Campuswide 
Senator. In this 
week’s public 
input, Richard 
Thompson, 1983 
UCSD alumnus, 
gave very insight-
ful advice for protesting the painting 
of Graffiti Hall: He suggested students 
threaten to turn the location into a 
copy of Stanford’s “kissing tree” as 
an intentional breeder of meningitis. 
Please, no. 

After that awkwardness came a 
presentation from the Coalition of 
South Asian Peoples that gave me a 
fresh and informative dose of Cold 
War history and South Asian geog-
raphy, perhaps the most useful five 
minutes of the night.

Next, Triton TV requested funding 
for equipment necessary to start their 
upcoming Triton News Network. In a 
follow-up from last week’s contentious 
discussion, Social Sciences Senator 
Colin King recommended they ask 
individual college councils for fund-
ing rather than dipping into man-
date reserves — which is supposed 
to be earmarked for emergencies — 
because, as he reminded us, “they 
really have excess funding this year.”

TTV’s demo video sparked more 
enthusiasm from A.S. Council than I 
have ever seen, including the shock-
ing ring of audible applause (I did 
catch a few members throwing in 
hand twinkles). Executives from 
TTV then went on to explain their 
projects and the response they hope 

to elicit from students.
“Make ‘em laugh, make ‘em cry, 

all those great emotions,” Station 
Manager Taylor Chan said. 

And then, to throw on the pres-
sure, he added, “This is a pivotal 
moment in TTV history. The ball’s in 
your court. What are you going to do 
with it?”

Council got the ball rolling by 
approving the allo-
cation of funds.

On a less pro-
gressive note, 
there were no 
applications for 

the second Revelle Senator position, 
so council announced that the appli-
cation had been re-opened. Revelle 
Senator Soren Nelson then reboosted 
A.S.’s confidence from his observa-
tions as the undergraduate representa-
tive at Tuesday’s Transportation Town 
Hall: “Transportation looked kind of 
bad, because we’re looking real good.”

My farmost favorite moment of 
the night was the music that came 
when AVP Student Advocacy Alex 
Noronha was named A.S. Council 
Factor of the Week: “I’ll Make a Man 
Out of You” from “Mulan.” It took 
serious discipline not to sing along 
— sadly, several A.S. councilmembers 
were unable to restrain themselves — 
stopping the video short after the first 
verse made me cry a little inside, and 
several councilmembers seemed to 
feel the same way.

As a part of Sikh appreciation and 
awareness, AVP Academic Affairs 
Robby Boparai announced that Nov. 
21 is “Take a Pic with a Sikh” day.

Finally, President Andy Buselt 
made a request for next week to be 
“hat week.” I expect an illustrious 
display of hats next week, council-
members!

 Yes, please. Anything that will 
keep me awake.

new  business thoughts on the 13 books that changed 
America. Moreover, the channel high-
lights UCSD’s diverse education system 
by airing footage of various interviews 
with UCSD department of psychiatry 
professor Joel Dimsdale and professor 
of political science Steve Erie.

In the future, the channel aims to 
broadcast more segments of author 
talks, faculty lectures and student 
research. Their next project includes 
interviews with the winners of the 
Undergraduate Library Research Prize.

“Students are very important to 
us at the library,” university librarian 
Brian Schottlaender said. “We want to 
engage them in this initiative.”

In highlighting student and faculty 
achievements, Schottlaender hopes 
that the channel will raise awareness 
of the initiatives in which the library is 
involved, providing patrons of Geisel 
and members of the community with 
up-to-date information on research 
projects and their benefits.  

Another aspect of this initiative 
includes airing content from the San 
Diego Technology Archive, a collec-

tion of information that documents 
the history of companies that form the 
San Diego region. The channel hopes 
to air interviews of San Diego’s tech-
nology leaders who could highlight 
the region’s development as one of the 
nation’s largest technology hubs.

“We plan to work with our stu-
dents, librarians, faculty and members 
of the community,” Schottlaender said. 
“[We want] to develop a wide range of 
compelling programming.”

New Stem Cell Clinic Will Have Two On-Campus Facilities

knowledge to the test in people, for 
people.”

The Sanford Stem Cell Clinical 
Center will consist of facilities at four 
different locations in the Torrey Pines 
area. Two will be on campus, including 
a new outpatient clinic on Campus 
Point Drive and an inpatient facility 
at Jacobs Medical Center. These loca-
tions, which will be used for conduct-
ing clinical trials, are expected to fin-
ish construction in 2016. Additionally, 
the center will conduct research and 
imaging off-campus at the Center 
for Advanced Laboratory Medicine 
and the Sanford Consortium for 
Regenerative Medicine.

Stem cell therapy is currently one 
of the most promising areas of research 
in the medical field. Using stem cells, 
which are capable of regenerating dam-
aged neural tissue, researchers hope 
to someday treat debilitating ailments 
such as Alzheimer’s, Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease and spinal cord injuries.

Chancellor Pradeep Khosla has 
expressed high hopes for the new 
research center.

“This gift and the creation of the 
Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center will 
further UC San Diego’s leadership in 
stem cell science and therapeutics and 
advance our region’s reputation as an 
international, collaborative hub for 
stem cell research,” Khosla said in a 
UCSD News Center press release.

This donation marks the second 
time that Sanford has funded such a 
facility; in September 2008 he donated 
$30 million to UCSD to create the 
Sanford Consortium for Regenerative 
Medicine.

Sanford is optimistic about the 
impact the new clinical center will 
have on stem cell research.

“I believe we’re on the cusp of turn-
ing years of hard-earned knowledge 
into actual treatments for real people 
in need,” Sanford said in a press release 
to the UCSD News Center. “I want 
this gift to push that reality faster and 
farther.”

Attempted Rape Reported Near UCSD Campus

An attempted rape occurred 
near UCSD at the San Diego Villas 
apartment parking garage this past 
Monday evening.

According to an NBC San Diego 
release, the armed suspect confront-
ed a 23-year-old female exchange 
student in the garage and attempted 
to “reach up her shirt.” 

Officials reported on Tuesday 
that San Diego police are currently 
searching for the suspect, who was 

described in the NBC San Diego 
report as a man “in his early 20s 
with a thin build.”

Police have yet to release a sketch 
of the suspect.

When I first got an iPhone, everyone told me to turn off my “Location 
Services” setting. I heard the same 
speech from my parents, countless 
uncles, aunts and friends: Allowing 
Apple access to “determine your 
approximate location” could 
potentially show dangerous people 
where I am at all times, where I 
take my photos and even where I 
live. I guess you could say I’m liv-
ing life on the edge: I always keep 
“Location Services” on, and I’ll 
continue to do so until my phone 
sees its grave. 

Now, before anyone tries to send 
me an email with a lecture about 
why I need to protect this informa-
tion, I do have a valid reason for 
why I love the “Location Services” 
feature. I am notorious for mis-
placing anything of mine that falls 
under the categories of small and 
prized. And since my phone falls 
into both of those categories, it 
needs the extra protection.

Though “Location Services” is, 
admittedly, useless in the situations 
in which your iPhone is out of bat-
tery or has no cell reception, it’s 
just too convenient to deactivate. 
“Location Services” saves you from 
awkwardly calling a restaurant or 
walking into a lecture hall to ask 
about a misplaced phone. 

Instead of looking around all the 
wrong places, “Location Services” 
saves you time and grief. When you 
can’t find your phone, you simply 
log into your iCloud account on the 
“Find my iPhone” website to see 
exactly where it is on a GPS map. 
The website even allows you to 
register your other Apple products, 
like your MacBook or iPad, to keep 
tabs on them as well.

For almost every instance that 
I’ve “lost” my phone, the scenario 
plays out exactly the same way: 
“Locations Services” comes to 
my rescue every time. Whenever 
I’m out with a friend or running 
errands alone, I inevitably get 
caught up in whatever it is I’m 
doing, forget about where I put my 
phone and become convinced that 
my phone slipped out of my pocket. 
The following ensues: I frantically 
empty my purse and have a mini 
panic attack at the mere thought of 
blowing big bucks to buy a replace-
ment phone — all this before I rush 
home to my computer to access 
“Find My iPhone.” 

In almost every instance, it 
turns out that my phone left itself 
at my friends’ houses or slid its 
way out of my pocket and under 
the seat of my car. Last summer, 
the tag team of “Location Services” 
and Find My iPhone prevented a 
class-act Lauren Koa breakdown 
by showing me that my phone was 
actually in my car, not on a table 
at the sketchy Taco Bell where my 
boyfriend and I chose to grab a 
late-night dinner. 

Now, those who are skeptical of 
the access that private organizations 
or the NSA have in our lives may 
call me an easy target, but I wish 
there was a GPS feature on almost 
every other thing I own. I probably 
should be more responsible with 
my personal belongings, but if luck 
is not on my side, at least I know 
my iPhone is.

Two years after California’s Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act was signed into law, improving university accessibility for all 
of California’s high-achieving students remains on state 
leaders’ radar. And that’s a good thing.

New UC President Janet Napolitano’s first major proj-
ect — her $5 million allocation to provide scholarships 
for undocumented students at UC campuses — shows 
promise for her ability to address issues that affect a 
diverse range of constituents. 

However, Napolitano’s announcement comes right on 
the heels of the “No to NapolitaNO” movement, which 
leads to the concern that the new UC head is only making 
this move to gain political popularity.

Those critical of the record-setting number of 
deportations — including over 400,000 in 2012 — that 
Napolitano oversaw as Secretary of Homeland Security 
argue that she has personal disdain for undocumented 
immigrants. But as we’ve argued before, Napolitano is 
working for California, not the federal government, and 
as UC president she has a vastly different set of objectives. 
Her job is no longer to keep the country safe from attacks 
but to improve education for California’s (and the coun-
try’s) best and brightest students.

Though she has yet to deport a single undocumented 
UC student (or make any indication that it’s on her agen-
da), much of the contention thus far over her position as 
UC chief has focused on her Homeland Security record.

Then, out of the blue, this new $5 million project 
appears. While we always applaud scholarships and hope 
that they will enable a growing group of students to afford 
a UC education, it’s pretty clear to us that this scholarship 
was engineered purely to appease those opposed to her 
appointment.

Taking the politically popular route sets a pretty dan-
gerous precedent for the UC Office of the President. In 
this instance, she might get away with it, but if future 
UCOP action is only based on who yells the loudest dur-
ing demonstrations, we could be in for a money-losing 
roller coaster ride.

As California wraps up a year that saw a state budget 
surplus and increased funding to UC and CSU campuses, 
a UC president that throws money to dispel criticism 
could prove costly for a system that has struggled to 
stabilize tuition levels over the past three years. As we’re 

A.S. Council, led by Vice 
President of Finance Sean O’Neal, 
has recently made significant strides 
in working to reduce a six-figure gap 
in its annual budget. The finalized 
budget reflects an over-allocation of 
a whopping $2 in this year’s annual 
budget, which is commendable, but 
it still raised some eyebrows over 
decisions of where funding was cut. 
Or where it was added. 

The revised budget — which 
council finally passed last week — 
actually reflects hasty and question-
able judgment. While council mem-
bers are probably tired of hearing it, 
we’re tired of saying it: A.S. Council 
needs to get its act together and make 
better financial decisions. 

When the budget negotiations 
were over and the dust was cleared, 
we saw a few red flags when we com-
pared the final budget with the pre-
liminary one from three weeks ago. 
While A.S. Council did have to adjust 
for a drop-off of 195 students from 
its projected enrollment of an even 
24,000 undergraduates, serious cuts 
were made to a range of A.S. Services 
and operations. The Office of College 
Affairs saw a 25-percent reduction in 
funding, and the offices of Diversity 
Affairs and Athletics Relations also 
saw cuts of $1,000 apiece.

These cuts, which are harmful to 
anyone who benefits from College 
Affairs education campaigns and 
diversity activities, are justified if all 
of the expenditure across the board is 
seeing cuts. Unfortunately, that is not 
the case. While the five Bear Garden 
events for this year saw a com-
bined $2,000 loss, the quarterly A.S. 
Pancake Breakfast actually saw a net 
increase of $1,500 from its projected 
funding or 2013–14 funding. 

An increase of that caliber is not 
justifiable for what is a largely cos-
metic event during finals week. While 
the study break is usually appreciated 
by many students, there comes a 
point when there’s actually a prohibi-
tive cost attached to free pancakes.

This mismanagement of funds 
only becomes more obvious with a 
look at the $4,000 cut made to A.S. 
Grants. That cut is, by and large, the 
most heinous as it takes money (and 
a lot of it) directly out of the pockets 
of undergraduate students hoping 
to get funding for extracurricular 
research. Considering the amount 
that was added to Pancake Breakfast 
funding, it is ridiculous that grant 
funding got battered as a result.

Moreover, just when we thought 
that the political battles going on 
among A.S. members (namely the 

cold war between Vice President of 
External Affairs Vanessa Garcia and 
seemingly the rest of council) were 
over, we can’t help but speculate that 
part of the motivation to cut A.S. 
Grants, which operate under the aus-
pices of the Associated Vice President 
of Academic Affairs, has some politi-
cal background. The current AVP is 
Robby Boparai, who served as the 
biological sciences senator candidate 
for the One Voice slate during last 
spring’s election. Considering the 
number of grievances filed between 
One Voice and the victorious Keep it 
Real slate last year, we can only hope 
that bad blood isn’t still a factor in 
A.S. decisions.

We are further concerned by 
the fact that three vice presidents 
are all taking $500 pay cuts from 
the projected budget while the larg-
est stipend, the president’s $10,000 
allotment, survived the cuts pro-
cess unscathed. Council missed 
an opportunity to trim the largest 
student stipend on council and help 
students benefitting from important 
student services.

The budget is balanced, and what’s 
done is done, but we hope that A.S. 
Council will think more about con-
stituents’ real needs when making 
future decisions.

BEER WEEKSAN DIEGO2013
T asting over 30 beers at San 
Diego Beer Week’s open-
ing event was calisthenics for 
taste buds, as well as a wake-up 
call that life is much better when you 
shed your beer color blindness to see more 
shades of beer than just light, dark and Pabst 
Blue Ribbon. Fortunately, it’s not too late to attend 
SDBW, as some tipsy genius deemed beer week to last 10 
days, ending on Nov. 10. 

The premise of SDBW is to promote the local craft beer com-
munity, as sponsored by the San Diego Brewers Guild, by holding over 
600 events at bars and restaurants across San Diego. These events include 
craft beer tastings, giveaways and food pairings — all listed on the SDBW website. 
Think of it as San Diego Restaurant Week in liquid form. This may be the best time of 
the year for broke college students to drink classy beer on a budget — the trick is finding 
events that won’t charge you $30 for a tasting.  

To try a variety of beers, go to a brewery or a bar where you can order a flight of beers, such as SD 
TapRoom, located on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach, which features different breweries each day and 
charges $2.50 for every six-ounce sample. If you want to grab a pint of craft beer without spending too much, 
look for bars and restaurants that have $4 pints, such as 83 Degrees (Carlsbad), The Joint and Luigi’s at the Beach 
(both in Mission Beach), which has $3 pints on Friday. Many bars (Helm’s Brewing Company in Kearny Mesa, Time Out 
Sports Tavern in Gaslamp, Local Habit in Hillcrest) are also doing “keep the glass” deals where you go home with a souvenir 
from your craft beer experience. First, figure out how far you’re willing to drive, and then check out what looks interesting in your 

area. The Museum of Man in Balboa Park also just opened up its BEERology exhibit, styled as a trip through beer history, showing 
that even the Ancient Egyptians were fond of loudmouth soup.

I had the chance to sample unique flavors at SDBW’s opening event that actually made me question my preconceived schema of 
what beer really is. One taste of Ballast Point Brewing’s “Victory At Sea,” and my first thought was “butter.” It is a rum barrel-aged 

beer, almost black in color, that makes you feel like you’re drinking Irish creme, but in a dark beer consistency. The Lost Abbey 
had one of the longest lines to taste their “Framboise de Amorosa,” and at first taste, my eyes squinted like I had just bitten into a 

lemon. The beer is a rich red color with seriously sour taste — it reminded me of a fruity cider. But the standout of the night had 
to be Karl Strauss Brewing Company’s “Peanut Butter Cup Porter,” a dark beer whose name couldn’t be more surprisingly accurate. 

The beer is unfortunately only sold during beer week, so check the Karl Strauss website to figure out where you can snag a pint.
The beer week crowd is one of all ages, but lightest on the college demographic. You’re more likely to see your graduated 

friend who now has a real job than someone from one of your classes. Yet at one point, when I was fumbling with my taster 
glass, food and notepad, my glass slipped and shattered on the floor. The sound was piercing, and I stared shamefully at the 

mess on the floor as the entire bar erupted in a unified “Ooh...” as if it were a fight on a school yard. It was nice to see that 
no matter the age, the middle schooler in all of us lives on. 

If you’re a UCSD student, add SDBW college bucket list stat — you shouldn’t leave San Diego without taking 
advantage of this rich craft beer community. San Diego was considered an up-and-coming craft beer city in 

2011, but I think it’s safe to say that it has officially arrived in 2013 as a prominent beer hub of America, 
rivaling Seattle and Denver. Since 2011, the number of regional breweries has doubled to over 65, 

and just this year, CNN ranked San Diego third for the Best Beer Towns in America (following 
Portland, Ore. and San Francisco). Little known fact: UCSD Extension actually paired with 

local brewers to design a curriculum on microbrewing that teaches both the technical 
and the managerial aspects of the industry, which allows students to earn a Brewing 

Certificate. All in all, San Diego is the ideal place to get “hopped” up on craft 
beer (sorry, but you had to have known a beer pun was headed your way). 

SDBW ends this Sunday, with a closing Beer Garden event at 
Torrey Pines Lounge. Beer novices needn’t be timid — no need 

to know the difference between stout and an IPA or employ 
a swirl and sniff method to the taster — all that’s 

required is an interest in beer and a readiness to 
try something new.

WHAT TO SEE NOV. 7-10



WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME 
TOMORROW?
� View the screening on Nov. 10, 6:30 p.m. at Price Center 
Theater.

Gay or straight, everyone wants to find love, and in the movie “Will You 
Still Love Me Tomorrow,” the main character, Weichung (Richie Jenn), has 
been missing out on love by living as a straight man and repressing his sexu-
ality. Written and directed by Arvin Chen, this film is a Taiwanese dramedy 
that follows the hard decisions that two couples must make as they ques-
tion their love lives. Relationships begin to unravel when Weichung’s life is 
suddenly changed by a handsome flight attendant named Thomas (Wong 
Ka-lok) who walks into the optical shop where he works. He finds himself 
attracted to Thomas, and suddenly, the feelings he has hidden for years begin 
to flare up. Weichung must decide whether to stay with his adoring wife, 
Feng (Mavis Fan), who wants to have another child with him, or return to the 
gay scene he left before his marriage to look for love. As if Weichung’s issues 
weren’t hectic enough on their own, his sister, Mandy (Kimi Hsia), is also 
struggling with love and her fears of marriage to her fiancé San-San (played 
by rocker musician Stone). The lead characters must decide if their signifi-
cant other is the person to bring them joy, or if they should make a change by 
ending their relationships and looking for love elsewhere.

This film’s message is serious, but it’s also sprinkled with humor that 
pokes fun at the lives of the main characters, whether it is Mandy watch-
ing romantic soap operas and hiding at home or San-San’s obliviousness to 
Weiching hanging out at a gay club. There are also several fantastic scenes 
that bring a smile to the faces of those watching, such as when Weichung’s 
boss happily floats away like Mary Poppins on an umbrella leaving Weichung 
in as the new manager of the shop. Even Feng has her stage to shine on dur-
ing her karaoke scene where she lets loose on a night out with co-workers, 
when she sings the film’s namesake song. and it turns into a lit-up superstar 
performance that reminds the audience of the real-life pop singer Fan is. 
Chen’s film’s special quirky touches like these make it unique and refreshing 
because it is the juxtaposition between absurd comedy and serious emotional 
dilemmas. Most mainstream movies found today are strictly dramas or 
comedies but do not include the many sublevels that this film contains. The 
star-studded cast has exemplary comedic timing and never misses a beat, but 
also manages to elicit genuine empathy through turmoil that feels very real. 
Chen’s film has a style of its own — it truly captures the audience’s attention 
and feelings, so that by the end, moviegoers will sit at the edge of their chairs 
hoping for a happy resolution for the characters they’ve grown to care for.

VERY ORDINARY COUPLE
�View the screening on Nov. 9, 7:50 p.m. and Nov. 10, 7:35 p.m. at Digiplex Mission Valley.

A romantic comedy doesn’t seem like a fitting genre for an inevitably tragic film, especially one with a deceptive 
title like “Very Ordinary Couple.” While the plain semblance of the title seems one-dimensional, director Roh Deok, 
in her first film, sheds light on the modern conflicts that some couples face: subterfuge, dishonesty and upholding a 
facade of faux chemistry.

Although they are bankers, leading characters Lee Dong-hee’s (Lee Min-ki) and Jang-Young’s (Kim Min-hee) con-
spicuous tautness throughout the film don’t exactly align with the perception of a banker being stoic and calculating. 
The two wrestle with cunning mind games and guile tactics in pursuit of recovering their tainted, failed relationship. 
Though anticipated that they would be saddled at the hips once more, with glowing eyes basking in a tender lock, it’s 
merely ephemeral. Viewers can see the toxic impact bleed into the characters; Dong-hee indubitably flares with enmi-
ty as Young inoculates herself with lies. The comedic irony of the film lies in their attempts at denying their antipathy 
with shoddy assurance that their relationship will prove satiating.

The cast does a brilliant job of rendering the tension and emotion needed to convey Deok’s message; the strin-
gent nature of their relationship appears immaculate — the flaws of each character begin spiraling out of control and 
exacerbate their standings. With a brilliant script and framework, Deok knows how to evocate the viewer’s interest 
by crafting a scenario that is equally poignant yet relatable. Quality angst ensues: The film is not the cliche romantic 
catch-all film that one might expect, but instead a voice for contemporary issues that plague the end of relationships.

SHADY
� View the screening on Nov. 8, 10 p.m. at Digiplex Mission 
Valley.

The image of a parrot (yes, the avian) being held like a dagger is not 
what one might casually think about, but “Shady” provokes the mind to 
discern such perceptions. But it’s not just animals at stake. For enthu-
siasts of character development, deception and angst, screenwriter 
Ryohei Watanabe provides exactly what is needed for a gripping experi-
ence.

“Shady’s” protagonist, Misa (Hiroki Horikawa), is seemingly tailored 
to endure the burden of stumbling into the sheathed world around her. 
She possesses all the traits needed to provide a dynamic that will later 
leave her in shambles; as a credulous, reticent loner, Misa finds herself 
a subject of ridicule for her conspicuous awkwardness. Her closest 
confidants are exactly what an introvert could believe: a pet fish and a 
parrot. While her mentality is coddled, it gradually begins to unweave 
when she befriends her classmate, Izumi (Gota Ishida). Immediately, 
we see the viewer can watch as her eccentric oddities begin twisting 
Gota’s character to life: from “finding pressure points” (more like stab-
bing her friends) to an unhealthy need for attachment.

Despite the initial fluff that the film presents, there is a strong sense 
of foreboding imagery that things are not as immaculate as they stand. 
As a coming-of-age film — in pertinence to Misa’s gradual, shifting 
view of the world as a boarding school student — “Shady” presents the 
psychology of drama, angst and possessiveness of teenage culture with 
justice. The struggle for Misa to grasp the twisting reality is highlighted 
by the film’s constant tension and strong images (including blood, 
pedophilia, kidnapping), bringing the dark side of Japanese culture to 
life. Even with the vernacular differences, the cast manages to unfold 
the story with clear intentions that will leave viewers edging for sanity.

ON THE JOB
� View the screening on Nov. 9, 9:45 p.m. and Nov. 10, 7:10 
p.m. at Digiplex Mission Valley.

“On the Job” is a fast-paced Filipino crime drama that presents the 
audience with a true story of what happens when murder is one’s moti-
vation to stay alive. The story outlines the corruption of Filipino politi-
cians and military officials as they contract prisoners as hired assassins. 
Head point man Mario (Joel Torre) and his apprentice, Daniel (Gerald 
Anderson), are temporarily released from prison to perform their jobs. 
They, as well as many other prisoners, work to provide their families with 
money and a better life, all the while risking their lives at the hands of 
the government. Francis (Piolo Pascual), a young police officer, is in the 
pocket of his political father-in-law. His moral conflict between hiding the 
scandal and his duty as a police officer counteracts Torre and Anderson’s 
characters. 

Award-winning director Erik Matti shows the nit and the grit of Metro 
Manila’s city streets in this honest and realistic story, based on true sto-
ries of police corruption. Matti shows the suffering of urban poverty and 
excludes an optimistic ideal for the situation. The film gives viewers a 
realistic view of what happens when one man tries to work against a cor-
rupt system on top of the lack of remorse found in a killer.

The relationships in the movie are what keep the audience involved. 
Each character has a family that they are working for and trying to pro-
tect. These relationships, especially the one between Mario and Daniel, 
are the catalysts that drive the characters to their actions. The dynamic 
between Mario and Daniel provide viewers with the reality of the pris-
oner’s situation, illustrating their desperate attempts to work for a better 
life. Torre plays a hardened man with no qualms or regrets about his work 
and no remorse for what he does. 

The bitter sadness of the movie and the reality of it make for a thrill-
ing story you won’t want to miss out on. The unknown background of 
the characters and the sense of mystery throughout the film keep you 
intrigued and create a harsh reality of extortion, crime and desperation. 
The accurate portrayal of the conflict and realistic events will give a 
refreshing look at a world that is unlike their own. Matti creates an anx-
ious situation filled with tension that will bring an audience in and hold 
them until its end.

HOW TO USE A GUY WITH SECRET TIPS
� View the screening on Nov. 13, 7:15 p.m. at Cinepolis 
Del Mar.

“How to Use a Guy With Secret Tips” proves that when you’re stranded on 
a beach, the best thing you could ever do is buy a training manual on boys.

Smothered by the rampant sexism that exists in Seoul television com-
mercial production, underappreciated Choi Bo-na (Lee Si-young) remains 
trapped in her position as an assistant director. After losing a promotion and 
hitting rock bottom, she encounters a so-called “doctor” (Park Yeong-gyu) 
while wandering on a beach. He sells her instructional videos on how to 
exploit men for success, and soon, the videos propel her career and even help 
her attract the romantic attention of a famous actor.

At times, the film feels like an effortless watch. Lee’s adorable performance 
and impressive comedic timing help “How to Use a Guy With Secret Tips” 
move along seamlessly. The time it takes Choi to quit hiding behind her yel-
low hoodie and instead morph into a confident career woman is rapid yet 
natural. Despite how male-dominated Choi’s world was, no actor performed 
better — or was more interesting — than the female lead.

Although it bears predictability with its all-too-happy ending (albeit on 
purpose) and transformation of an “ugly duckling,” Lee Won-suk’s directorial 
debut’s biggest selling point is his aesthetics-heavy, satirical take on sexism. 
Many Korean films fail to take advantage of their (primarily female) target 
audience to depict gender inequalities at large, but Lee constantly pokes fun 
at the sensitive issue with vibrant animations and onscreen text reminiscent 
of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” to break the fourth wall. And by tying a neat 
bow at the end, Lee mischievously — and cunningly — mocks the industry’s 
blind eye towards sexism and how “easy” it is to overcome. The messages 
are clear: Sometimes hard work doesn’t equate to success; sometimes life is 
unfair. 

In the film, all Choi needed to conquer men (and the world) was a VCR 
player, tape and some time and money to spare. However, a romantic comedy 
needs much more than just a few simple elements to succeed. Thankfully, 
“How to Use a Guy With Secret Tips” packs enough heart and creativity to 
engage viewers for its entirety, even going as far as inviting them to imagine 
what societal messages a rom-com can convey. Ultimately, that provocation is 
what helps the film transcend the tropes it purposely drags along.

HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY
� View the screening on Nov. 12, 8:50 p.m. at Digital Gym 
Cinema.

A distraught teenage girl (Ness Roque) imagines she lies dead in a cemetery 
while children bring flowers to her headstone. This is one of many aestheti-
cally pleasing scenes that drive Director Raya Martin’s “How to Disappear 
Completely” beyond the ubiquitous coming-of-age tale. Martin stirs several 
genres into this experimental film as he successfully burrows into the sociopo-
litical history of the Philippines.

This film renders character build-up obsolete, and instead drives them 
straight to their breaking points as they deal with the nightmares, native legends 
and realities that shape their lives. The story is told in a series of surreal vignettes 
that follow the troubled young woman as she avoids her alcoholic father (played 
by Nonie Buencamino), and resists male dominance. 

While haunting flashes of a mythical child abductor (Ronnie Martinez) 
will leave you with a potent taste of Filipino folklore, those who prefer dash-
ing toward Wikipedia for yes or no answers will find no safe haven in this film. 
Martin ditches plot, and instead presents a multitude of distantly related scenes. 
And yet, these short clips are so powerful on their own, that the viewer finds no 
need to tie them together. In one scene, the teen’s mother (played by Shamaine 
Buencamino) runs her hands through raw meat. In another, Roque walks 
through a clearing, carrying a cardboard gun over her shoulder. In the end, the 
viewer is left trembling in the aftermath of unusual images.

And while Roque accurately portrays the role of an unstable preteen hid-
ing behind her short-haired, androgynous appearance, the cinematography 
and music score are what sends this film soaring. Directors of photography J.A. 
Tadena, Albert Banzon and Maisa Demetillo create dreamscapes by filming in 
slow motion. And the repetitious psychedelic dubstep music by Eyedress per-
fectly complements these drawn-out scenes, turning this film into an ethereal 
experience.

All in all, this film is akin to a Dali painting that has come to life. The raw 
images are enough to immerse the viewer into the mind of an unsatisfied teen-
ager who would rather “disappear completely” than face her demons.

TO MY DEAR GRANNY
� View the screening on Nov. 9, 1:45 p.m. at Price Center Theater.

Happy-go-lucky film student, A-Da (played by Lawrence Ko), has a pleasant, superficial relationship with his 
grandmother. But when she lands herself in the police station for attempting to murder a thief, A-Da is forced to 
try to make sense of her actions. He pieces together her life, beginning with the death of her son (his father). This 
jumpstarts a psychological journey that explores the aftermath of loss in a Taiwanese household.  

Perhaps the most satisfying part of this film is that Director Yu Ning Chu gives every character equal screen 
time. Each family member deals with the death of the father separately; this is what brings them together. Chu 
takes the idea of “filling the father’s seat at the dinner table” literally. He plays with the idea of the spirit, tastefully 
introducing the deceased father as a tangible presence (Shih Chang). And because he silently observes the family, 
Chang bypasses the much feared Casper the Friendly Ghost trope and jets forth into a more sophisticated realm.

 The same sophistication leaks into Chu’s artful distortion of time, which constantly moves between past and 
present. This makes for a rich understanding of the psyches of Granny, mother and grandson, and the viewer 
quickly assembles a full family portrait. If the disoriented time scheme tips you over, rest assured you will be 
caught and nursed back to health by Chu’s talented cast.

Lawrence Ko effortlessly shifts from film student to middle-aged post-graduate, and Mei-Hsiu Lin, who plays 
his mother, does an honest job of depicting a working widow. She is submissive in the factory and tough at home. 
It is in her superb ability to balance both characteristics that the viewer grasps the limitations placed on women in 
Taiwan. 

And of course, while Granny’s look of despair is enough to make you want to call your own grandmother, the 
scene in which she spies on a thief while taking long drags on a cigarette evokes raw feeling. Chu does an excellent 
job of transforming Granny into a full character— a rare treat in the world of entertainment.

If there is anything outright wrong with the film, it would be Chu’s attempt to address childhood, parenthood 
and death in one stroke of the pen. Fortunately, the stellar cast provides enough natural allure to tie these topics 
together, resulting in a hauntingly genuine insight into tragedy.

KARAOKE GIRL
� View the screening on Nov. 13, 8:05 p.m. at Digiplex Mission Valley.

Karaoke Girl is a biographical film about an alluring young woman in a desperate situation that many women 
in the nightlife business find themselves in. Sa Sittijun finds her way back to the city of Bangkok where she works 
as an escort to make enough money for her family after she is abandoned by yet another man.

The story, written and directed by Visra Vichit-Vadakan, is a documentary about this young girl’s life, weav-
ing together a story about a struggling girl with an optimistic outlook and her journey away from being an escort. 
He contrasts the dark, seedy streets of Bangkok with the beautiful nature in the rural part of Thailand where Sa’s 
family lives. Vadakan captures Sa’s happiness as she travels home, showing her devotion to her family. Despite her 
unfulfilling life as an escort, she pushes through to earn money to send back to her family. 

The conversation and dialogue in the film are simple, but Sa’s doubt and pain are instead revealed in the silent 
moments that the audience shares with her. We see her suffering as she deals with the men that have wronged her 
and desperately tries to gain some control over her situation. 

The highlight of the film is Sa’s inspiring karaoke performance. Her song is a statement of empowerment and a 
way for her character to stand out against the men who have hurt her. 

This movie is an inspiring tale of female empowerment and how despite Sa’s struggles and the hardship that she 
has been through, she perseveres and takes control of her situation. Her ending number will move the audience, 
and her optimism and perseverance will give any woman who feels trapped in any way hope for a way out and 
ultimately, a better life.

UCSD has qualified for the

Region will qualify for the NCAA 
Championship tournament. Before 
last week’s results, the Tritons were 
ranked No. 4, two spots ahead of Cal 
State Los Angeles, but after failing to 
qualify for the CCAA tournament, 

UCSD will be left out of the nation-
al tournament, ending the season 
ranked eighth in the region. 

Although this year marks the first 
time in recent memory that UCSD’s 
season has ended in the beginning of 
November, the young squad has hope 
for success next year. Next season, the 
Tritons will return its top two scor-
ers — junior All-American Cassie 
Callahan, who scored six goals in 
2013, and freshman Jamie Benedetto, 
who scored four.

The UCSD men’s tennis team 
grabbed several wins — including a 
semifinal appearance by the doubles 
pair of Max Jiganti and Kona Luu 
— to close out the fall season at the 
Southern California Intercollegiate 
Championship in Los Angeles this 
past week, Oct. 30 to Nov. 3.

“We lost where we were expected 
to and won where we were expect-
ed to,” UCSD head coach Timmer 
Willing said. “There’s a lot of room 
to work, but we accomplished what 
needed to be done.”

In the Singles Main Draw com-
petition, the Tritons recorded four 
wins. In the qualifying round, 
sophomore Ganesh Alagappan and 
senior Devon Sousa had byes that 
advanced them to the second round. 
Sophomore Horea Porutiu won his 
match against Azusa Pacific’s Pascal 
Engel in two sets, allowing Engel to 

win only four total games to his 12. 
All three were defeated in the 

second round. Alagappan came close 
in the third set but fell short to Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo’s Devin Barber.

Senior standout Jiganti was the 
only Triton to win in the Round 
of 32, where he came up against 
UCLA’s Ryota Tachi. In the first set, 
Jiganti went up six games to three. 
But Tachi did not give up so easily 
on his home court and forced a third 
set. Jiganti won the third and final 
set by a score of 7–5, allowing him to 
move on to the next round but lost 
to Brigham Young University’s Juan 
Canales in straight sets.

UCLA’s Clay Thompson, cham-
pion of the 2011 tournament, took 
the singles title, defeating teammate 
Mackie McDonald in three sets. 
UCLA, ranked No. 2 in the NCAA, 
placed seven of the top eight finalists 
in both the doubles and singles main 
draw and qualifying brackets.

In the doubles component, Jiganti 
teamed up with junior Luu to defeat 
Loyola Marymount University’s 
Sebastian Bustamante and Robin 
Kiyabu 8–7.

Jiganti and Luu later fell to UCLA’s 
Mackie McDonald and Karue Sell 
8–6 despite having an early 5–0 lead. 
Jiganti and Luu were down, but not 
out, as they managed to beat Sterling 
Galli and Nikki Rae of BYU 8–3 in 
the consolation match.

“This shows not that we lost but 
that our ability level is up there,” 
Willing said.

UCSD will break from competi-
tion until the beginning of February 
when the Tritons will face Division I 
University of San Diego on the road. 

The Tritons’ first home match 
will be the following week, Feb. 8, 
against region rival Azusa Pacific.

witnessing with UCSD’s transporta-
tion debacle, students tend to want 
to have more goods and services 
and want to pay less. When this 
philosophy translates into a social 
movement, and UCOP prioritizes 
making opponents happy, the UC 
piggy bank will pay the price.

It’s also concerning that 
Napolitano can siphon off such 
large amounts to coddle her haters, 
especially when projects are only 
benefiting a tiny portion of UC 
students who happen to be particu-
larly dissatisfied — and vocal about 
it — as of late. 

The Bakersfield Californian 
reports that approximately only 900 
of the UC system’s roughly 239,000 

students (approximately 0.038 
percent) would qualify for the new 
money. While this scholarship will 
help those affected by the DREAM 
Act, it leaves most UC students in 
the shadows.

Napolitano should also make 
decisions that will help students 
who come from less politically 
active demographics. Two 2012 
bills proposed by California State 
Assembly Speaker John Perez, AB 
1500 and AB 1501, hoped to pro-
vide thousands of dollars in tuition 
cuts to middle-class students by 
closing a $1 billion corporate tax 
loophole on companies operating 
outside of California and channel-
ing the money toward UC and CSU 
students. While those bills eventu-
ally died, the need for middle-class 

scholarships and keeping tuition 
costs low remains.

Napolitano would do well to 
recognize that initiative, even 
though its political support stirs 
less attention than “DREAMers” 
and their supporters.

Accessibility, diversity and 
affordability remain three of the 
major issues for the UC system as 
Napolitano’s term kicks into high 
gear. The new scholarships will 
help develop the UC system in all 
of these areas, though their effect 
on such a select few just illustrates 
Napolitano’s drive to be liked above 
all else. Napolitano needs to shift 
her focus beyond whoever’s loudest 
on any given day and address the 
UC system — and all of its students 
— in its entirety.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Last weekend, another group 

calling itself SJP — Students for 
Justice in Palestine — spent three 
days on the Stanford campus at a 
conference they said would “create 
space for a critical discussion on 
solidarity.”

We felt that this was an impor-
tant goal and expected SJP mem-
bers to stand with Palestinians who 
are in favor of peace with Israel. 
Such pro-peace Palestinians need 
all the help they can get, because 
the two Palestinian governments 
in power today refuse to accept 
the principle of “two states for two 
peoples.” In Gaza, Hamas rules with 
an iron fist and continues to pre-
pare for war against Israel. In the 
West Bank, Palestinian Authority 
President Mahmoud Abbas’ four-
year term expired in 2009, but he 
has refused to hold new elections. 
In both places, Palestinian security 
forces intimidate and jail dissidents 
who criticize their leaders.

We studied the SJP conference 
program. None of the Palestinian 

government’s human rights viola-
tions were mentioned. Instead, the 
program was filled with euphe-
misms about the importance of 
destroying Israel, the most progres-
sive state in the Middle East. Is this 
what it means to stand in solidarity 
with Palestine?

Elsewhere in the Middle East, 
oppressed peoples are in great 
need of support. Women who 
want to drive in Saudi Arabia. 
Anti-theocratic bloggers in 
Iran. Christians in Egypt. Even 
Palestinians fleeing the civil war 
in Syria. There is no mention of 
these cases in the SJP conference 
program.

Why does SJP only mobilize to 
promote reactionary forces? What 
will it take for SJP to show solidar-
ity with progressive, pro-peace 
groups? Are anti-Israel extremists 
the only kinds of people who are 
worthy of SJP support?

We don’t get it. We are trying to 
figure it out. And until we do, we 
are Students Justifiably Perplexed.

The UCSD women’s soccer team 
ended its season with a 1–0 loss 
Sunday, Nov. 3 when, 42 seconds 
away from a draw in a must-win 
game, it allowed the deciding goal 
against Cal State Los Angeles.

The loss came two days after a 
goal by redshirt sophomore defender 
Michelle Yasutake in the 81st min-
ute allowed the Tritons to fight for 
their playoff lives, defeating Cal Poly 

Pomona 1–0.
“Michelle has been incredible 

all year,” UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus said. “She moved from left 
back into the sweeper position, and 
she’s done it tremendously. She’s been 
tremendous all year.”

Against Pomona on Friday, Nov. 
1, UCSD’s second-half performance 
was a complete reversal from the first 
45 minutes. UCSD had zero first-half 
shots, and while still being outshot 
18–5 on the night, UCSD proved to 
be the stronger side after the break. 
Yasutake’s late goal was vindication 
for the team after a tough night’s 
work.

On Sunday, Cal State Los Angeles 
controlled the tempo for much of the 
match. But an exciting second-half 

Golden Eagle goal made for a dra-
matic overtime period. In extra time, 
CSU Los Angeles hit the post at the 
end of the first overtime before seal-
ing the victory in the waning minutes 
of the second. Sophomore goalkeep-
er Kelcie Brodsky made eight saves 
overall, keeping the scoreboard level 
for 119 minutes.

“To be fair, I thought overall today, 
they were better than us,” McManus 
said. “I’ve got to give credit to L.A. 
They came out with a great game 
plan, executed it, and they edged us 
today.”

marked the final home game for

F or the first time since 2005, the UCSD men’s soc-cer team has qualified for the California Collegiate Athletic Association conference tournament.
The Tritons will go into the four-team tournament 

with the No. 2 seed. The Tritons will face No. 3 Chico 
State this Friday, Nov. 8 in the semifinal round. If the 
Tritons win, UCSD will advance to the championship 
game to face either No. 1 seed Cal State Los Angeles or 
No. 4 seed Sonoma State the following Sunday.

The finalized bracket was announced Friday, Nov. 
1 after Cal State Monterey Bay, formerly at the top of 
the North Division, was forced to forfeit the results of 
three games for fielding an ineligible player. The result 
left Monterey Bay one point shy of qualifying for the 
CCAA tournament and pushed Cal State Los Angeles 
to the top of the CCAA South Division, one point ahead 
of UCSD. Although UCSD head coach Jon Pascale’s 
Tritons have no postseason experience, Pascale said 
he’s confident his team has the talent to win the CCAA 
tournament.

“I absolutely think we have what it takes to win,” 
Pascale said. “We finished second overall in the league 
on a technicality, and we’re a good matchup with Chico. 
I certainly feel pretty good about our chances.”

UCSD is 1–1 with Chico State this season. Back in 
September, the Tritons took a 1–0 win against Chico. 
The Wildcats returned the favor in mid-October, snap-
ping UCSD’s seven-game winning streak, beating the 
Tritons 1–0 in overtime.

On paper, Chico State and UCSD bear a striking 
resemblance: Both teams have a tough backline that 
lives and dies on the set piece. UCSD (8) and Chico 
State (11) have the two lowest goals against average in 
the league.

But against the Wildcats, Pascale said the Tritons 
will have the advantage on the wings, where the Tritons 
have an arsenal of capable midfielders. Junior Brandon 
Bauman, who has a team-leading five assists this sea-
son, has looked particularly dangerous, as have senior 
Will Pleskow and junior Elan Gefen.

Unfortunately, UCSD may go without starting mid-
fielder senior Cory Wolfrom, who has scored three 
goals for UCSD this season. Wolfrom sustained a toe 
injury last Friday in the Tritons’ match against Cal 
Poly Pomona that may keep him out of the rotation 
this weekend. Midfielder Taylor Wirth finished the last 
game of his collegiate career with a sprained ankle.

“I think the last couple times we’ve played Chico, 
when we got the ball on the wings, we’ve really caused 
some trouble for them,” Pascale said. “As long as we’re 
able to limit [Chico’s] set piece opportunities, I think we 
have a good shot at beating them.”

UCSD’s semifinal match is slated for this Friday in 
Turlock, Calif. at 11 a.m.

The winner will advance to the championship match 
on Sunday, Nov. 10 at 12:30 p.m.

Cal State Los Angeles will go down in the record book as the 2013 
CCAA regular season champion, thanks to two points earned off a tech-
nicality. Still, the Golden Eagles are arguably the most dangerous team in 
the conference.

Cal State Los Angeles has weapons all over the field.
Defensively, the Golden Eagles have empirically as good a backline as 

the Tritons, giving up just eight goals in 18 conference games, due in part 
to the efforts of goalkeeper Mike Biergarten. Biergarten has the highest 
shots-to-save percentage in the CCAA at .886, just in front of Triton goal-
keeper Josh Cohen (.862).

In the attack, the Golden Eagles have plenty of options, including team-
scoring leader Andre Bismark (six goals in 2013), who scored against the 
Tritons last week.

Sonoma State is another beneficiary of Cal State 
Monterey Bay’s NCAA infraction, slipping into the 
fourth seed. 

The last time the Tritons faced Sonoma, UCSD took 
a narrow 1–0 win on a free kick that deflected into 
the Seawolves’ goal. UCSD managed to outshoot the 
Seawolves 18–8 back in September, but Sonoma could 
look to upset in Turlock this weekend. The Seawolves 
have won five straight matches, and they have a number 
of players on the roster that took the team to the CCAA 
Championships in 2010.

No. 4 Sonoma State
Sept. 29: UCSD 1, Sonoma State 0

Expect a good matchup between Chico State and UCSD 
this Friday in the semifinal round.

Both teams play defensive-minded soccer — Chico State 
gave away just 11 goals in 18 games this season — and 
according to UCSD head coach Jon Pascale, the Wildcats are 
very deadly on the set piece. UCSD played witness to Chico’s 
efficiency with the free kick in mid-October, when the 
Wildcats used a free kick to score the golden goal on a header.

Still, Chico State’s 10-game winning streak was snapped in 
the Wildcats’ final game of the season when they lost on the 
road 2–0 to Cal State Monterey Bay.

No. 3 Chico State
Sept. 20: UCSD 1, Chico State 0
Oct. 13: Chico State 1, UCSD 0
