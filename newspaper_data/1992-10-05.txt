The decision 10 cut the mim' pugram may 
be made easier by the retirement of flUe than 
half of the full-time faculty rmnrers in the 
depar1:m:nt. 

"When you have five wt of nine [faculty

UCSD begcIl its 1992-93 academic yef6 this fall 
with more students living on campus thai at arty other 
UC campus. About 6,000 students, includ~ 2,235 
out 0( 2,650 in the entering first~a- class will reside 
on campus, accading to lJCSO Dtrectoro( Housing CI1d 
Dining SeMces I...arTy Barett. Barrett said studies shatv 
that college students v.tlo Ii\!! on campus tend to get 
better Wades and are more likety to Waduate. 

There is a strong demand anong students for 
housing on campus, Barrett said, as evidenced by the 
fact thlt UCSO cnticlpates full occupMty and has a 
waiting list this fall. By comparison, most CMlPUses 
typically aYel"age between 300 to 500 vacancies. With 
the completion 0( the new Wtmlfl College housire 
complex, 00 additional 600 Wlits 0( housing will be 
made avail<ble next year. This, Barrett explained, will 
ensure 00 adequate hous~ stock to meet ooticipated 
student demand aver the next few )'ears. In aidition, a 
recent change in canpus housing policy that now 
allows stlXlents fran differert coIleees to live together 
makes campus housing a more popula- option ~ 
some students, Barrett said.

Today. the grand~on of the aforementioned Polish 
immigrant., wan~ to ~II his home in the ,ubur~ of Lo~ 
Angeles and move to Nevada where he and his loving 
\\ ife can retire and spend their golden years in the relative 
,erenity of the desert. He i tired of the traffic. the crime. 
the pollution. the sagging e onomy. the growing tax 
burden. And he is not alone. 

The California his parenb discovered in 1952 no

Facing a growing budget deficit and increa~ing 
demand on tate ervices. the pork-merchants in Sucrd-
mento, in their infinite wisdom. decided that the only way 
to keep the tate afloat while maintaining "es~entiar' 
programs was to raise taxes. Hence. the budget sell-out of 
1991 - $8 billion in new taxes. touching everything from 
snacks to gasoline to newspapers. 

To the surprise of no Olre. except perhaps the nitwits in 
the Capitol, the tax scheme failed to do anything except

Education: California's Latest Fault 
COMMENTARY: The impending privitization of the state's education system is sending shockwaves through disadvantaged 

families who fear a return to economic and social segregation 
By Wendy McNeil 
Contnbuting Opinion Writer 

In the wake of California 's budget 
cri ' is. the system of public education 
i again taking the brunt of financial 
cuts. due to the state's mismanaged 
funds and dimini 'hing 'ocial values. 

It seem that California's how-
10w-c.Ul-we-go taxpayers are unwill· 
ing to invest in a sound public educa-
tion system. for mainly one of two 
reason . 

Either they consider any govern-
ment bureaucracy a necessary evil-
a money devouring monster which 
produces low quality goods - or 
they embrace a republican/! ibertarian 
model whereby the "voucher sy tern" 
would be implemented. producing an 
economical tock of intelligentsia. 

The weaknesses in these theorie 
are manifold. Fi t. "education for the 
rna es" truly i a necessary public 
good. 

Any lIChool i~ worth far more than 
every tax dollar Ihat i poured inlo it. 
since educated people are an invest-
ment which will eventually produce a 
higher rerum. 

ow. the demise of cash flow into 
the California schools i demoraliz-
ing the teachers who have nOl been 
laid off. crowding the classrooms. 
and producing a young population 
ignorant of everything except basic 
lack. 

Thi does not have to be the case. 
Before the progression of disinlegra· 
tion of the California schools. educa-
tion was - and still could be - about 
quality. excellence and the pursuit of 
an individual' potential. 

The basic truth is that a nurtured 
populous will eventually produce. but 
they will not yield a profit without 
proper cultivation.

the voucher system insi ts that the

best mean to a better world is to trash 
the "government" and tum all school-
ing into a subsidized. private enler-
prise (somewhat like the University 
of California.). 

Thus, parents could take their 
voucher from the govemment, and 
instead of sending their son ordaugh-
ter to the local school, they could pay 
the remaining tuition so that their 
child could go to a religious school. a 
college preparatory school, an ath-
letic orienled school, etc. 

Though this is a commendable 
plan from the perspective of indi-
vidual freedom and personal choice. 
the privatizal ion of education will only 
.encourage tralificalionof wealth and 
ethnicity. 

Higher income schools wou ld in-
cubate students from the concerns of 
the rest of their society. and lower 
income schools would till receive 
minimal funding. a smaller pool of 

potential teachers and incre.'lsingly 
tense ethnic strife. In this divided 
environment. the privi leged members 
of the group would occupy the pow-
erful positions in their society and 
replicate the model of opulence ver-
sus deprivation. 

It is a trite but true phrase: the rich 
get richer. the poor get poorer. But 
every "private sector" enthusiast ad-
vocates just that. often for the great 
god, Progress. 

However. progress is not possible 
in a world of "trickle down excel-
lence. "This state will not benefit from 
a group of elite and alienated intellec-
tuab and a burgeoning "proletariat." 

California can nO( strike a balance 
of human resources in an eraofteach-
ers' srrikes and social nnd economic 
bankruptcy. California will have to 
decide what i more ·important. its 
people. or its TV's. ports cars. and 
tanning salons.

A TYRANT'S AGENDA 
COMMENTARY: Proposition 165 is just 
another blatant power grab by Pete WIlson 
By Uana Jacobs 
ContributIng Opinion Writer 

Perhaps I have the political process a bit confused. I've 
always thought that politicians wUllfed to get reelected. Pete 
Wilson doesn't seem to be shooting toward thi goal; rather he 
appears dead-set again t holding any political office ever again. 
I uppose he could have an agenda lurking somewhere in his 
murky policie~O(her than to be unemployed in the pol itical arena 
for the rest of his working life - in fact, the only goal he is 
heading toward besides unemployment is to be the mo t power-
hoarding politician in the hi tory of California. If this is Wilson' 
true agenda. he is on a speedy course to success. 

Many Californians are till dumb-struck by the policies 
Wilson has already enacted on the job. As he makes budget cut 
after budget cut, we cringe as the results of his cut affect our 
lives. In the area of education. high chool have lost counselors 
and re ource centers, Cal State school are losing c1as e~ by the 
dozens and UC students are working overtime 10 pay ma~~ive 
tuition increases. 

But Wil on is yet unappeased by the brutal budget-slashing he 
has performed in rhe last two years - now he is presenting us 
with a proposition which would give him even more power to 
mutilate the budget. 

Proposition 165, according to the non-partisan National Con-
ference of State Legi latures. will disproponionately hift state 
power from the hands of the state legislature to the hand of the 
governor. Those who back Prop. 165 claim it is a necessary step 
to endow Governor Wilson with the power he need to mantpu-
late the budget to the best of his abilities. 

If the governor's Prop. 165 is pa~d. Wilson will be ordained 
with more power than any other governor in the United States. 
and the state legislature will be robbed of power to the poim of 
being the weakest in the country. For some inane reason. wii 'on 
thinks he requires more power than what he already has! 

If Prop. 165 is passed, Wil on will be able to declare "financial 
emergencies." and thus make more cuts which would siand as 
law until lhe legi lature repla es them with alternative programs. 
Since Wibon has already proven hi out tanding lack of good 
judgement with budget-related issue ,endowing him with nearly 
autonomous power over the budget is a terrifying prospect. 
indeed. 

The tate legislature 's tumultuou 6O-day budget forging 
process that dragged into the summer is being manipulated by 
Wilson to make voters believe that the legi lature i~ a collection 
of silly children which he must have the final word over 10 
effectively run the tate government. 

Thi goal is renected in the initiative. Under Prop. 165, if the 
legislature doesn't pass a budget by July I. the governorcan make 
his own budget cuts. The govemor will al 0 have the power 10 
keep the budget in balance with his own cuts and to give the 
legislature seven weeks less to consider a budget. 

Not surprisingly, those who suppon Prop. 165 claim the 
measure is written poorly. and no court would actually allow 
Wilson to wield such a mighty budget-cutting word. We are 
actually expected to believe that somehow bad wording snuck by 
the governor and his henchmen, accidently endowing him with 
a mightier sword than he really wanted, which, of course. he 
would never use. 

A California under the innuence of Prop. 165 is frightening 
and difficult to imagine. The founding fathers of this country 
deliberately installed a federal system of checks and balance to 
ensure the people's safety against status-grabbing tyrants, James 
Madison wrO(e in TIle Federalist Papers that "if men were 
angels, no government would be necessary." Governor Wilson i 
definitely no angel. and the purpose behind his power-snaring 
agenda is hardly in the state's best interest. 

Contrary to what Wilson believes, he needs a very strong 
legislature to counter-act his foolish political behavior, as it is 
clear that his blitzkrieg deficit-reduction technique is serving to 
deprive most of his constituents of the state's resources and deny 
them the opponuni&¥ to pursue their goals.

AN ECOLOGICAL STATE OF EMERGENCY 
COMMENTARY: California must remain a world leader in facing the environmental crisis 
By Damen Scranton 
Associate Opinion Editor 

California i a world leader. In terms of econom ic produc-
tion. scientific achievement. computer capability and the trans-
fer of good and service, the state has made major break-
throughs in the past century. 1l1ese gains have not been made. 
however. without major cost to both. Califomia's and our 
entire planet's respective environments. 

nia creates about 1.5 percent of the world's carbon dioxide. a 
gas that accounts for 49 percent of the greenhouse effect and 
contribute significantly to global warning. 

• Over 75 percent of the nation's ozone expo~ure occurs in 
California with peak ozone levels that are three limes the 
fedeml standard for healthy air. Motor vehicle emissions 
account for over half of mog producing pollution. Your car is 

now one of more than 20 million in the state. 
20 million cars travelling more Ihan 60 bil-
lion miles annually. In California. trJflic 
congestion has risen 15 perceht every year 
since 1982. 

And o. overthe past de ade ,California has 
become another type of world leader. Behind 
regulation and acts of legi lation that are long 
overdue. yet viewed by many as ahead of their 
time, California has become a world leader in 
identifying different threats to the environment.

and db,covering different ways in which people

Compounding the frustration and 
misery created by the tate' fiscal 
apoplexy is the sense - articulated 
across the political pectrum - of 
alienation between the people and 
govemment. A similar disconnect is 
even to be found on thi campus in the 
aby mal lack of co-governance. Power 
seems to have lost touch - or con-
cem - with the human needs that 
legitimate it. 

Voting in an educated. infol111ed

pos ible elaborations: that collective

mentality; that m action is merely 
the result of a mi taken understand-
ing of how our allegedly fine political 
y tem works; or that it stems from 

the inner p 'ychological deficiencies 
of fringe elements. 

The embedded

lhat protest is inherently ineffective 
or "ludicrous." It does require that 
protest panicipanlS think critically for 
them~elve and act accordingly. 

Me A h ley asks "whether protest-
ing h~ ever had any real effect:' It 
demonstrably does: day-care would 

-

not otherwise exiM 
on thi campus; the 
co-ops would be 
long gone; it i aho 
quite reasonable to 

suppo~ t hat cut~ to 
thi., year's higher 
educat Ion budget 
would have been 
far worse had we 
merely ~hrugged: 
military involve-
ment in outhea~t 
Asia was impeded 

by dome~tic outcry; in South Africa. 
apartheid i~ falling; women ·ssuffmge. 
women's rights and civil rights " ere 
won through protest - though the 
latter two may require frequelll de -
fense. And let's not forget legal abor-
tion. JlI~t because immediate results 
don't materialize hardly means there 
are none. 

In fact. there are radicals who share 
Mr. Ashley'~ ~kepticism about the 
effectivene s of protest. With him 
they share an infantile demand for 
immediate gratification . 30-minute 

plot resolutions and im,tanl breakfast. 
Unfortunately. the "Real World" 
doesn't quite work that way. 

Many of these gains and victories 
were the productoflong ~trugg\e.al1d 

~ome e).acted heavy cO~t s. But under 
increasingly extreme circum~tance~ 
that do violence 10 people's lives. 
. aid radical are finding more sympa-
thy for militance and violence. With-
out advocating nor condemning this. 
I think a trend i~ emerging. 

True to prim fonn. Mr. A .. hley 
denounce~ SDSU's recent demon-
(rations with tales of tanned navels 

and lemonade. Deva'tating! Only 
there was no lemonade. 

Anyone curious about protest or 
concemed with the future of public 
higher education is invited to exam-

in~ the~e i~slJe~ fir~t-hand . On 
Wednesday. Oct. 7 . . tudents from 
UCSD.lIldSDSUwilldemomtrateat 
noon at the State Building in favor of 
enate Bill 1533. This bill would 

reallocate over $50 million from the 
governor's administrative budget to 
the UC, CSU and financial aid. For 
further infonnation contact the A.S. 
External office. It's time we make 
Mr. Wil son care about cuts. 

Mr. Ashley's desired course 
amounts to Iiole other than compla-
cency. Complacency in the short tenn 
will be ruinous in the future.

New Age 
All the Rage 
By David Snow 
Associate Features Editor 

The popularil)' of all sorts of New 
Age·sryle paraphemalia among some 
srudems ha.~ prompted many to wonder 
jU5t what it all means. The Conuover.;iaJ 
Bookstore in North Park, which special -
izes in New Age literature. and a number 
of self -described New Age believers on 
campus were happy to summarize the 
significance of a few of their favorite 
manifestations of the New Age 's 
influence within the UCSD communiI)'. 
Crystals and beads, they say, serve as 
more than just jewelry. As it tums out, 
there is a big difference berween the two 
in temlS of the properties they impart to 
the wearer. Some of the intriguing 
explanations of the New Age ornaments 
follow. for your enlightenment: 

• Cryltalc These funky linle gems 
are turning up everywhere: around necks, 
hanging from ears. You've undoul:ledly 
seen them. often encased in thin wire. 
prominently displayed on one of your 
·c1assmates. Crystals have become the 
must -have accessory among metaphysi-
caJly~otreCt students. They are believed 
to have been used in ancient Egypt. 
Crystals now have applications in 
electronic technology, but they can also be 
used to channel energy and positive 
"vibrations" to the wearer. 1l1ey are often 
used to enhance optimistic thought 
patterns and improve spiritual perfor-
mance. 

"They're beautiful," says crystal 
enthusiast and UCSD employee Tiffany 
Shubert "They're also more personaJ than 
things like diamonds." 

They can range in price from 50 cents 
up to hundreds of dollars, depending on 
the size and quality of the stone. Crystals 
have won many converts over the past 
few years. Word has it thai crystals can 
sometimes be drawn to a spiritually 
powerful person from across me room as 
they sleep. Formerly skeptical students 
have been known to awake with crystals 
lying beside them on the pillow.

't was shaping up to be an evening like most 

others ar medical student Jeff Weider's night 
job. "We had bum victims, gun shots. stabs, 
people getting hit by cars. Every night 
somebody's died on us," he recalls. 

At the UCSD Medical Center trauma room 
where Weider and four of his classmates are 
completing their flJ'St week of a three-week 
rotation, or short internship. emergency 
situations arise every day_ They must know how 
to deal with each situation as it arises, the 
students explained in an informal interview 
together Friday. 

"Basically, the role of the students in the 
whole resuscitation is we draw the blood from 
the groin area. we do the rectal exam, which 
is ... very impot1ar\t, and we also empty the 
bladder and check for internal bleeding," says 
medicaJ student Jan Schimke. 

Medical students

the exciting and

cooker of the UCSD 

Medical Center 

But their supportive role does not end there. 
"Once a patient leaves here and goes up to the 
floor, or maybe they go to the intensive care unit 
[lCU]. we're still respon ible for following that 
patient each day," says medical student Greg 
Berns. "We've got to speak to them. we have to 
examine them every day, we have to draw blood 
from them multiple times each day and check on 
those. It 's not trivial stuff," 

'" think for all of us. trauma is kind of 
exciting:' Schimke continues. "You never know 
what's going to come in, and you never know 
when they're going to come in. 1 kind oflike 
acute care, where you have to be really on top of 
it." 

"Liternlly, people are trying to die, and 
you're trying to prevent that." explains medical 
student Elliot Brandwene. "Their injuries are

"1I's the true frontline," adds 
medical student Ouistopher Crisera. 

David HyOl., an associate profes.'iOr 
of urgery who is also chief of the 
division of surgery and director of the 
ICU at the medical center, is pleased 
with the opportunity that the facility 
offers his students. 

"I think they get ellposed to a wide 
variety of acute care problems. /I 's 
been a very uccessful program. The 
srudents are integr.ued as a member of 
the team, and are an essential pan of 
the team," Hyot says. 

Some patients who are severely 
injured will slcip the trauma room 
altogether and be shuttled straighl 10 
the operating table. says Brandwene, 
"They'll get 'em in there, and within a 
minute they'U have their chest open. 
BUI il doesn't overcome you - the 
facI thaI they're open, because 
everybody has roles, and you're 
focused on thaL" 

'That' one of the nice things 
about Ihis service in lerms of our 
pen;pective," he elaborates, "Here you 
have a job and you are actually 
important. You are integral to the 
care." 

'1"he whole thing is that it' a 
learn effort." agrees Schimke. "When 
the team is working well logether, 
then it just clicks. It can make a 
difference, you know? I've seen it 
happen in the O.R. [operating room] 
before where a guy would have died 
if things had not worked perfectly 
with the whole team. I mean, you 
don'l think of your.;elf as personally a 
hero, but you get an adrenaline rush 
from il when something good 
happen ." 

Crisera concurs." 0 maner how 
bad you're hurting at four in the 
morning or something like thaI. 
you're so awake when the patient

"UteraUy, people 
are trying to die, 
and you're trying to 
prevent that." 

Everyone has a job. We have 
assigned duties," says Schimke. 

Weider describes lhe scene as 
"fine·tuned chaos. It's a poeoy-in-
motion kind of Ihing.·' . 

The pressure of making a mistake 
in such a stresSful aonosphere rests 
squarely and heavily on the shou lden; 
of the tudents, yet they seem to relish 
the excilement thaI cores with it.

Yet accidents sometimes occur in

precautions and rigorous safety 
measures the tr.lUm3 leam uses to try 
to prevent them. 

"In the O.R. there 's always 
increased ri k of getting ~tuck with 
needles and lUff," says Schimke. "I 
personally have gotten stuck. and 
nobody's really at fault, il just occun;, 
It 's one of the risks of being in the 
medical profession." 

The students interning in the 
medical center also mw,t accept what 
might be described as a ri k of

"There' a nw-se who' ruming

Although the two people involved 
in Ihis scenario may have different 
understandings about what took place, 
this event must be defined as a rape. 
Contrary to popular notions of rape, a 
majority of victims are acquainted 
with the man that rapes them, and Ihal 
makes coming to grips with the crime 
all the harder. 

Acquaintance or "date" rape is 
forced. unwanted intercourse wilh a 
person you know. It is an act of 
violence that is no stranger 10 college 
campuses. 

How common is rape at UCSD? 
According 10 campus police. there 
were no officially reported rapes last 
year. Yet acconling to a Student 
Safety Awareness Program study, 
UCSD statistics match national 
univen;ity slatistics, which stale that 
one in six women are sexually 
assaulted (molested groped at) while 
they are in college, and one out of 
eight are victims of rape. Of those 
eighty-five percent know their 
assailant. 

Many people would associate rape 
with'dark alleys and ominous 
strctngen;. But at college, rape usually 
occun; where students would 
otherwise feel comfonable: at a puny, 
on a date or in a donn. All of these 
setting are difficult to avoid as a 
college student, but there are sensible 

precaution~ that students can take to 
avoid rape. Seeking out relationships 
with people that have an understand-
ing of what rJpe is will usually help in 
developing safe situations. "Trust 
your instincts. A void SQRleone that 
gives you a bad feeling," advises 
Nancy Wahlig. coordinator for the 
Student Safety Awareness Program. 

Women's Resource Center 
(WRC) peer counselor Debbie James 
believes that the prevention of rape 
should start at what she sees as the 
root of the problem. "We need to 
redefUlC masculinity, TJ()( acconling to 
violence, aggression and brute 
strength, and inc<rporaIe elements 
into a good definition of masculinity, 
like sensitivity and nwturance. When 
we get to that point we will be raising 
men who won'l be rapists." 

James feels that rape is an extreme 
fonn of male socialization. Men are 
used to being in control and able to 
get what they want Men are 
socialized into associating sex with

behavior. " 



DATE RAPE: Women need to

aggression. "When we get that to an extreme form. we have 
behavior that says that men can have sex with women when they 
want to. that the sex can be violent and that , he doesn't have to be 
con<oenting. because he hru. grown up with an image of her as 

pas.~i ve and ~uiting hi .. needs. 
"Once male!. get excited. they think they have to have me 

re;olution of their excitement, and Ihat they're not in control of it. 
So they're able 10 put the blame on their bodie:.. and then on the 
women for exciting them," ,he explairu..

According to James. when a woman accuSe!. a man of r.sping her. 
. lety always judge!. her first : her act ion;. what she wa .. wo.!aring, 
her reputation. If the woman decide:. to pre:.. .. charg~ again\! the 
perpetrat r"he often faces a fonn of "re-victim ization."

trial, or to pot someone, .vho might have been a friend 31 one 
time, in jail. 

"As women. we're taughlto accepI male aggressive behavior, 
and if we get angry and defend oor..elves, that we're bitChy 
women. We need to encourage more womelltO rebel," James 
believes. 

James, a senior majoring in psychology. say that the reality L 
that men usually have greal control over how women act. "We 
just mold our behavior around \hein;. rather than being taught 
from an early age lhal we do have thL~ right to our body and no 
matter what, that' our right. and we have to do whatever we 
have to do to maintain that 

"It's going to take a 101 of fundamental change:. in our values 
and the way that we r~ children to overcome thi~ in ~iety," 
he says. 

The WR is a place where rape victirru. can come to talk 
about how they feel, which i~ one of the key factoo in the healing 
process. James notes thai dealing with rape i ' an on-going 
pl"OCe.'>S that la<JS for life. 

"I think there is a 101 of in<"Cn\itivity ru. far ru. not realizing the 
long term implic.ations and how it can really affect people in their 
relatioo,hi~, in their security and sense of ~If-wooh." ~y 
James. 

James think people in iet need to learn that it is okay to 
talk a ut it, without ten;ion or dio,cOlnfoo. "We need to get to a 

Monday. 0('101 .. ,,. 5. 1992 

point where people aren't intimidated to talk about it and we can 
woric on it together:' 

A rape victim has to woric through many diftkult feelings. She 
has to learn how to mil to he~lf that she wa~ raped. and that it 
was not her fault. She has to Ieam to ~ ~If again ru. a :.trong, 
clean. healthy person. Many rim . a transition from hun to anger 
is a sign of healing. Transforming from a victim to a survivor is an 
imporran step. 

''The biggesl thing b to talk to someone and not keep it a 
secret," say Wahlig.

many years a~. 
We walked to a 
food court, and he 
got a giant Philly 
teak sandwhich 

and ate it with 
grease and ketchup 
dripping all over

got chunks of

Schimke recalls a conversation with a third· 
year medical Studem she once had when he wa.<. 
a flfSt·year student. N, M1e l~ened excitedly to 
him describe working in the trawna center, she 
jokingly a.<.ked "Oh, w you're Low Man on the 
totem pole?" And the older student replied, "Jan, 

cOlllinues. 0.11' Jl()( everywhere. iI's JUSl the 
general allnO'ophere, and people who' ve been 
doctors for 20 years say, ·Oh. well, I went 
through it. so you need to go through it 100. '" 

"II's like a haze." says Berns. 
But all seem willing to accepl that getting 

dwnped upon by their superiors in what 
Schimke describes as the" urge!)' hierarchy" is 
only a small drawback to the whole trauma 
room experience. 

''That' a Iinle bit of a black picture, you 
know. , mean, iI's a pretty good experience," 
points OUt Crisera. and the others el1lhusiastically 

"I've seen it happen 
before where a guy would 
have died if things had 
rwt cworked perfectly cwith 
the UJlwle team." 
I'm Jl()( even on the totem pole." 

"But you know, we depend on other tuff in 
the hospital. too." adds Berns. "We 'Ie greatly 
dependent on the nurses and the clerics who have 
to take the orders and give them to th( nurses, 
and blood drnwers.-' 

"Not only can the resident and the attending 
[physician) yell at you, we are about the only 
people that these nurses and all the other 
supporting staff can really rag on," Schimke 

express their agreement.

"And the surgeons are. a lot of times, on the

say 8randwene. 

"So part of their inflated ego is justified," 
adds Crisera. '" mean, if anybody's going to be a

THE DEMOCRATIC GoAL IS FAIRNESS, NOT MANlPULATION 
Editor: 

An editorial in the Oct. I Gllard-
ian (""Manipulation and the ews") 
levelled serious charges against the 
UCSD Democratic Victory Coalition. 
Thesecharge~ were dangerously mis-
leading. nO! to mention based upon 
fac tual errors and distortions. More 
pecifically, the Gllardiall editors 

have confused duplicitous manipula-
tion with po. itive advocacy and failed 
to fulfill basic journalistic re -Ixmsi-
bilitie . 

Far from being "public relations 
hucksters" as the editorial charges. 
we. a members of the Democr.ltic 
Coalition, are simply UCSD students 
trying to raise the level of political 
con ciousness and activity here on 
campus. We are accused of "wanting 
to have a story in every issue,"To this 
charge, we plead guilty. But is it uch 
a terrible goal'l The Gllardial/. after 
all, is the primary vehicle forcommu-
nication anddbcussion in the campus 
community. 

We have enough respect for the 
Gllardian to recognize that the be t 
way we can get coverage is by orga-
nizing po itive and newsworthy ac-
tivities such as regi tering over 2,400 
campu voters in the last two weeks 
and filling the Price Center Ballroom 
with students for a live satellite hook-
up with Bill Clinton and AI Gore. 

If the positive advocacy we have 
described and practiced is "manipu-
lative," then we must again plead 
guilty. But the strong implication in 
the editorial is that we have engaged 
in duplicity by somehow misrepre-
senting ourselves and our activities. 
This is patently false. While the roles 
of political activi ts and the press are 

at times. and of ne-
ce ity, adver-

~urial. we have 
made every effolt 
to e tablish a 
strD ight forward 
and honest relation-
shipwilh Gllardian 
reporters, editors 
and staff. based on 
openness and mu-
tual respect.

editorial. 
Here's what we did: We planned 

two events. a rally on Friday and a 
mobilization meeting on Monday. As 
was reported in the Gllardial/. we 
organized a Clinton/Gore rally on 
Friday, Sept. 25. In the process of 
organizing the rally, Peter Navarro's 
wife said there was a good chance he 
would attend. We forwarded this in-
fonnation to the Gllardiall. At the 
rally, we infomled the Gllanliall re-
porter of our intention to hold a mobi-
lization meeting (or "strategy ses-
ion") the following Monday. We 

had previously infonned the editor-
in-chief of both these events and dis-
tributed hundreds of fliers campus-
wide describing them, as well. 

It is clear the "two lGllordiall] 
editors" confused these two events 
and came to the Monday meeting 

cal. 
The Gllardioll'sothermain charge 

is that "pre-written commentaries and 
leiters awaiting the signatures of the 
faithful" were "ready to go." First of 
all, this a gross distortion of what 
happened. To be certain. one activity 
suggested allhe Monday meeting was 
to write lellers to the editor support-
ing Clinton/Gore. A student men-
tioned that sample letlers were avai l-
able and read an example. But it wa 
never our intention to collect signa-
tures on pre-fabricated leners. and 
indeed we have not done so. 

The Gllardiall, despite a knowl-
edging that they have received no 
such leiters or phone call , went with 
their editorial anyway. Ifwe were the 
duplicitous "hucksters" that they 
claim, why would we invite them to 
our "strategy ses ion" in the fir t 
place? 

Even if the Gllardiall' s charge 
were accurate. such leiter writing is 
common practice in American poli-
tics and social movements. In fact . 
legislators and newspapers II ually 
welcome such feedbad. and dialogue 
- and if they don·t. well. they can 
simply choose not to print ~uch let-
ters. 

A members of the Democratic 
Victory Coalition. weenthusia~t ieally 
up port Bill Clinton iIlld Al Gore. In 

ClintonjGore we have a ticket that 
can win and a vision that we believe 
in. It is a vision for America we think 
the great majority of people at UCSD 
-staff, ~tudents and faculty - can 
support. And wearedoing everything 
we can to communicate our mcs~age 
honestly ;md effectively to the cam-
pus community. Over 400 ~tudenb 
are already actively involved in our 
movement. This itselfis a gre;it story. 
All weask of the Guardil1l1 is that they 
give it the coverage it deM!rvc .
