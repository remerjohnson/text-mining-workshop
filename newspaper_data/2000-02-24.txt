UNITED NATIONS - At least 
8 million Ethiopians are likely to 
suffer hunger or starvation this 
year; a ·crisis that could rival the 
1984-85 famine that kiJled at least 
1 million people, U.N. and inde-
pendent relief officials said 
Wednesday. . 

On Friday, the U.N. World 
Food Program will announce an 
appeal worldwide to raise about 
$50 million in emergency aid . 
Save the Children announced 
Wednesday that it had opened an 
Ethiopian famine fund.

LOS ANCI!LI!S - For Sen 
John McCain, the California pri-

inherit the western cowboy mantle 
of his political hero Ronald Reagan 
and become the Republican

the catch is that McCain could

Placard Misus~ Rising 
CRIME: Fine for handicapped parking violations increased by $60 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Illegal use of disabled plac-
ards on campus has recently 
increased according to the 
UCSD Police Department and 
the Office for Students with 
Disabilities. 

Roberta Gimblett, director of 
the Office for Students with 
Disabilities, said that while the 
misuse of disabled placalds 
occurs aU over campus, it is 
especially common in the three 
disabled parking spaces on 
Rupertus Drive near Center 

Hall. 
The fine for parking in a des-

ignated handicapped apace or 
the illegal use of a disabled 
placard is now $340, a $60 
increase from last year. 

Students who cannot pay 
the fee can perfonn community 
service and pay the $340 at a 
rate of $7 per hour. The com-
munity service can be used to 
pay either the entire fine or a 
portion of it. 

Students with disabled plac-
ards issued from the 
Department of Motor Vehicles 
and a permit from the Parking 

and Transportation office may 
park in red, yellow, green and 
metered spaces, but not in 
reserved spaces. 

Gimblett said that when 
people park in handicap-desig-
nated spaces, they place dis-
abled drivers at a disadvan-
tage. 

Officer Alan Jenkins of the 
UCSD Crime PreVention Unit 
said offenders sometimes have 
placards but park in undesig-
nated spaces.

UCTAs 
Hold Vote 
for Strike 
LABOR: Union 
members may walk out 
by end of Winter Quarter 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Teaching assistants from all 
University of California campus-
es will vote during the next three 
weeks on whether to authorize a 
strike. 

While dates for voting at 
UCSD have not yet been set, TAs 
at UCLA and UC Davis are hold-
ing strike authorization votes this 
week. 

Connie Razza, a spoke person 
for the Student Association of 
Graduate Employees/United 
Auto workers, said she believes 
TAs will vote in favor of a strike. 

"The membership is really 
u~t that the university is con-
stantlx breaking the law," Razza 
said. ' We expect a strong show of . 
membership support to authorize 
a strike if the university doesn't 
comply with the law." 

Razza said the university has 
broken the law by unilaterally 
making changes to working con-
ditions, dealing with hand-picked 
groups of TAs rather than the 
designated union representatives 
and pal'tWipation in "bad faith" 
barijsining, whereby the universi- ' 
t.y retracts offers it has preViously 
made. 

Brad Hayward, a spokesper; 
son for the university. called the 
union's accusations inaccurate. 

"The university has been bar-
gaining in good faith and will 
continue to do so," he said. "We 
hope that both sides can focus on 
productive negotiations at the .-. 
bargaining table.

DISCOVERY: Researchers use mouse to model human neurolog~cal degenerative disorders 
By THOMAS W 
Guardian Reporter 

Scientists at UCSD and UC 
San Francisco have used a mouse 
to model human neurodegenera: 
tive disorders such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. The project's findings 
will further the understanding of 
these disorders and may ulti-
mately lead to the discovery of 
new treatments. 

The project is lead by 
Professor Eliezer Masliah of 
UCSD's departments of neuro-
sciences and pathology. 

The scientists working on the 
project found that when bred in 
mice, the human Pf9tein alpha 
synuclein forms deposits ~ spe-

ciiic regions of the brain, possi-
bly impairing motor functions. 

"A portion of this molecule is 
found in the lesions of patients 
with Alzheimer's and 
ParkinSon's disease," Masilah 
said. "Mutations in this gene are 
associated with familial 
Parkinson's." 

Previous studies have shown 
increased levels of this protein in 
the brain cells of Parkinson's 
patients, but whether they are a 
cause or result of the disease has 
not been determined. 

"Our findings in experimen-
tal models demonstrate for the 
first time that accumulation of 
human alpha synuclein in neu-
rons actually causes a number of 
alterations found in these human 

disorders; namely, an abnormal 
build-up of rroteins in brain 
cells, a loss 0 specific neuronal 
connections and impairments of 
motor skills," stated study co-
author Lennart Mucke, professor 
of neurology and neuroscience at 
UCSF and director of the 
Gladstone Institute of 
Neurological Disease in San 
Francisco. 

"These results suggest that 
blocking the accumulation of 
alpha synuclein might help pre-
vent or treat Parkinson's and 
related conditions," Mucke con-
tinued. 

In the study, a human alpha 
synuclein gene was introduced 
into fertilized mouse embryos 
cells and was then implanted 

into mice, the offspring of which 
contained the gene in their neu-
rons. Among the offspring, the 
mice with high levels of protein 
in the brain were used to make a 
colony of transgenic mice that 
developed brain pathology. 
These mice had symptoms simi-
lar to those of Parkinson's dis-
ease patients. 

"The mice will be used to test 
drugs that are capable of block-
ing the aggregation of alpha 
synuclein," Masliah said. "The 
alpha synuclein aggregates are 
toxic and kill neurons, therefore 
drugs that might block this 
process in the transgenic mice 
might also stop the progression

ETHIOPIA: 
Two million in need 
of emergency help 
ContInued from ..... 1 
tion reconnaissance mission is 
planned next week for the hard-
est hit regions of Ethiopia, a 
country of about 60 million peo-
ple. About 2 million people are 
thought to be in most immediate 
need of emergency help, which 
can take weeks to arrive because 
of poor transportation and a 
lack of warehouses and centers 
for distribution. Airlifts may 
have to be considered, officials 
say. 

The world's response to the 
1984 Ethiopian famine was enor-
mous. Live Aid rock concerts 
alone raised about '$70 million. 
But by the time much of the aid 

reached Ethiopia, beginning in 
mid-1985, many thousands of 
people had perished. . . 

Aid experts (ear that If the en-
sis they see developil,1g this year 
has to reach visible proportions 
again before there is substantial 
ac tion, all their advance planning 
will be meaningless. "By then it's 
too late," said Jay Zimmerman, 
director of the Ethiopia field 
office of Save the Children, who 
spoke at a news conference 
Wednesday. 

"In some places, even if you 
could get food in tomorrow, 
they're past the point of recuper-
ation," he said. A region-wide 
shortage of water and food has 
already struck the southernmost 
parts of the country bordering 
Somalia and Kenya, he said. 
Drought conditions are expected 
to move north in coming 
months. 

The UCSD Guardian 

The volunteer medical agency 
Doctors Without Borders has 
reported that in one affected 
southern district, Code, it is 
already too late to set up feeding 
centers, as people have scattered 
in search of water, food and med-
icine, and often die as they move. 

Judith Lewis, the World Food 
Program's country director in 
Ethiopia, speaking in a telephone 
interview from Addis Ababa, the 
capital, said that the Ethiopian 
crisis has been building for sever-
al years. 

"This country is just so prone 
to being at the mercy of the 
weather anxway, so even in good 
years there s a need for food aid," 
she said. "This year we're just 
seeing a cumulative effect. That's 
why there are so many people on 
the edge."

A.S. Council Is Slowly Killing 
UCSD's AHernative Media 

Face it, UCSD's campus print media are dying 
an excruciating, pitiful death. 

Funding from the A.S. Council has been cut 
acro s the board. In 1996, under A.S. President 
Coleen Sabatini , campus media were allocated 
nearly $50,000. This year, the budget is under 
$30,000 with no funding set aside for new media. 
What is most appalling is that since 1996 the A.S. 
budget has actually increased by more than 
$300,000 to just under $1 million. 

A.S. Commi sioner of Communications Bobby 
Kim is not helping the dismal situation. Voted in 
last year a the les er of two evils, Kim knew near-
ly nothing about the position for which he was 
running. La t year, the Guardian gave both com-
mis ioner of communications candidates a vote of 
no confidence. Initially, Kim wanted to allocate 
tudent funds to academic departments - specifi-

cally hi own, the communications department. At 
the time of hi election he even had trouble naming 
two A.S. Council-funded publications. 

This year Kim will have received $1 ,800 for 
'fi lling" hi position, yet his paltry representation 

and impotent leadership have all but delivered the 
killing blow to media at UCSD. 

A A .S. commissioner of communication , he 
has pent more time changing hi hair color than 
fighting for campus media. 

Hln my opinion," Kim aid in a Guardian article 
(HA.S. Cuts Media Funding," Feb. 3), "funding for 
media wi ll go nowhere but down from here. A lot 
of paper i being wasted, and a lot of potentially 
great publications [are] simply thrown away 
because no one's reading any of it, if they can find 
it anywhere on campus to begin with." 

Kim' apathy and lack of confidence in the 
media i reflected in his incompetence. According 
to ources from the A.S. Council , Kim has done 
next to nothing this year. 

In an interview with the Guardian last year, Kim 
aid that he would market alternative media to 

increa e their audience. However, most students 
till have not heard of Satiricon or HealthBeat, two 

alternative publications on campus. 
Without a leader to fight for adequate funding, 

neces ary equipment and vital advertising, campus 
media will no longer exi t - not even in its cur-
rent, dilapidated tate. 

The bottom line is: Bobby Kim is a waste of our 
time, money and patience and should be removed 
from office.

Voters and Candidates Suffer 
From Primary Fatigue 

COMMENTARY: PrimM')' system draws anention away from national i ue 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

Campaigning for presidential 
elections starts earlier than the 
Christmas advertising blitz. By the 
time the New Hampshire primary 
and the Iowa caucuses rolled around 
this year, many voters were already 
suffering from several months of 
political fatigue due to the candi-
dates' early advertiSing campaigns. 
With only two weeks left before the 
critical March 7 primaries, it seems 
the candidates themselves are get-
ting tired as well - they have run 
out of things to say and have resort-
ed to repeating themselves during 
debates and town hall meetings. 

Yet many Americans, especially 
those who live in states with prima-
ry dates further down the calendar, 
don' t have a firm grasp on what the 
candidates' national platforms are. 
The primary system turns the first 
leg of the election trail into a series of 
regional campaigns that focus on 
local politics and try to downplay 
national issues. Candidates are 
encouraged to avoid making com-
mitments to any broad poliCies in 
order to avoid alienating the voters 
who are so crucial to the short-term 
goal of surviving the primaries. 

The primary system promotes a 
kind of campaigning that is not con-
ducive to the chOOSing of a national 
leader. Candidates who are mar-
ketable in the early states - that is to 
say, those candidates who have suffi-
cient financial stamina to keep plas-
tering the early s tates with advertis-
ing until their opponents run out of 
money and are marginalized or for-
gotten - take the lead and force their 
opponent out of the campaign before 
they can even addres the entire 
nation. The current front-runners, 
Al Gore and George W. Bush, are 
more than willing to say they are in 
favor of campaign finance reform in 
order to placate crowds and satisfy 
voters, but when it comes to putting 
such words into practice, the fact is 
their campaigns have raised the most 
money and they seem more willing to 

keep the status quo than they are to 
implement reform. 

Rather than talking about foreign 
policy or immigration, candidates 
stick to telling early primary voters 
what they want to hear. When the 
primary falls in an agricultural state, 
they talk about farm subsidies. 
When minorities are present, they 
talk about police brutality and 
Confederate flags. As the larger 
states start to roll around, they'll 
have to face more difficult questions. 
In New York they'll have to start 
talking about immigration and 
crime. In ~alifomia they' ll have to 
talk about defense spending and 
their ideas for military policy. In 
Texas they'll probably stop being so 
vocal about gun control and 
Confederate flags. By the time these 
states work their way into the politi-
cal spotlight, however, time may 
have run out for the trailing candi-
dates to salvage their dwindling 
momentum by making a stand on 
these important issues. 

Part of the problem with the pri-
mary system is the way the media 
chooses to cover campaigns. During 
primaries, the local media covers the 
candidates extensively, but the nation-
al ~edia doesn't have any interest in 
the local issues that come up in 
debates and speeches. Consequently, 
national news only focuses on the 
results of the primaries. The rest of the 
nation doesn't hear the issues the can-
didates are talking about in New 
Hampshire or Ohio; we only see who 
seems to be a viable candidate based 
on who is winning. 

In this vacuum of national issues, 
the media instead resort to sensa-
tionalism. The majority of what vot-
ers hear about individual candidates 
comes from those candidates' oppo-
nents. The biggest headlines center 
around John McCain accusing Bush 
of calling him a bigot, or Bush accus-
ing McCain of calltng him anti-

a.tholic, or Bradley accusing Gore of 
bemg a tool of the tobacco industry 
and gun lobbies or Gore accusing 
Bradley of running a negative cam-
paign - actually, all the candidates 

keep making this accusation. It 
seems that all the pots accuse all the 
kettles of being black. 

The media seize on the negative 
comments candidates make and 
ignore the candidates' own state-
ments. The media believe conflict 
makes better news than a talking 
head espousing his or her own polit-
ical views. Unfortunately, that's the 
entire point of political coverage, 
and personal barbs don't help edu-
cate the voters on the candidate ' 
platforms. 

The American primary system 
was designed to simplify the process 
of nominating candidates, but over 
time politicians have found ways to 
exploit the peculiar features of the 
system to their own advantage. This 

~ation doesn't need campaign 
fmance reform so much as it needs 
campaign reform. The date of pri-
maries needs to stop being left up to 
the discretion of the individual 
states, who will only keep leap-frog-
ging over one another in an effort to 
give their state more clout in choos-
ing the nation's leader, making the 
primaries earlier and earlier as the 
years progress. The federal govern-
ment should set the date of primaries 
based on a logical system centered 
on population and regional location. 

The three largest states -
California, Texas and New York -
span the entire width of the country 
and cover an incredibly diverse seg-
ment of the population. These states 
haye every justification for holding 
their primaries early in the cam-
paign. Rather than marginalizing the 
smaller states, moving these three 
politically diverse states to the fore-

fr~:mt of the primarie~ will force can-
didates to address Wider ISSUes ea rli-
er on, an~ give the rest of the country 
a better Idea of what the candidates 
stand for, rather than what they' re 
willing to tell the citizens of the 
smaller states in order to get their 
votes. Then, when the candidates do 
come to the smaller states, they can 
cross-examine the candidates on the 
views they have already expressed.

Other Students Besides Athletes 
Deserve Priority Registration 
COMMENTARY: Many people studying at UCSD have 
important time commitments that makes scheduling vital 
By SHANNON CASnE 
Columnist 

I've decided I need priority registra-
tion. After spending a considerable 
amount of time trying to fit a 10-hour-a-
week lab class into my schedule, I was 
told by Web Reg on Friday that all the sec-
tions are fu II. 

I realize that everyone else was griping 
about athletic priority registration a few 
weeks ago, but I didn't really care until 
Friday, when I realized it will affect my 
ability to get the classes I need. 

I don' t doubt that it's extremely helpful 
for UCSD's teams and athletes to be able 
to schedule classes around practice and 
game time. The problem I have with the 
policy is that it would be extremely help-
ful for all of us, not just athletes, to be able 
to take our first choices of classes, labs and 
sections. Unfortunately, the higher powers 
of UCSD have decided that athletics are 
more important than the rest of our 
extracurricular activities, and so they have 
given the athletes the ability to make their 
lives easier, while the rest of us have to 
work it out ourselves. 

Case in point: me. I have a three-year-
old daughter. I live in Poway. Thus, I try to 
schedule my classes so that I have to drive 
to La Jolla as little as possible so I can 
avoid traffic and stay home with my 
daughter. I am not on the five-year plan, 
so I would also like to get my degree com-
pleted as soon as possible. I think this 
should qualify me for priority registra-
tion. There aren't any coaches that would 
care, but my daughter and my sanity 
would definitely appreciate it. 

Think about all the benefits anyone 
would get from priority registration. People 
could ' plan classes around dub meeting 

times and club team practices. Classes 
could be scheduled around jobs. We could 
schedule classes around beach time, for that 
matter. The administration does not have 
the right to decide what activities are 
important enough to be given "priority." 

Some members of the campus commu-
nity - students and administrators alike 
- ha ve decided that UCSD athletics 
should be given top priority. These people 
have visions of Division I tea ms and 
Monday night football broadcast straight 
from La Jolla. They are pursuing these 
dreams at the expense of my education. 

UCSD was not created in hopes of pro-
ducing some really good athletic teams. It 
was set up as an institution of higher 
learning, for education and research. 
Those of us pursuing an education have 
always had to fight with research for pri-
ority; do we have to fight with the athletic 
department too? While I appreciate and 
value team athletics, I did not come to 
UCSD to watch or play sports. I came to 
get a degree in biology. It is unfair to grant 
athletes advantages in pursu ing their 
degrees due to the genre of their choice of 
extracurricular activity. 

I strongly admire athletes who manage 
to successfully juggle a full course load plus 
a demanding practice and competition 
schedule. However, I do not hold them in 
any higher esteem than my friends who 
manage to go to class while working as res-
ident advisors, those who go to class and 
participate in AS. councilor anyone who 
faithfully works toward their degree while 
pursuing their own interests. Because of 
this, I do not believe that we should allow 
the administration to priOritize our inter-
ests, talents and abilities by giving the ath-
letes priority registration times. They don't 
need it any more than the rest of us.

PARKING:

have a placard and park In a 
meter," he said . 

Jeff Hutchinson, sergeant of 
training and special events, said 
many people break the law by 
parking next to a handicap space. 

"Often tIme the [disabled-
reserved] spaces will be free but 
they'll park across the blue hash 
area." he said 

Gimblett said parking in the 
hash areas prevents disabled 
people, e pecially those in vans, 
from accessing ramps that are 
needed to lower wheelchairs. 

Gimbiett aid people will 
often misuse placards or park in 
spaces designated for persons 
with disabilities because they are 
late to class or frustrated because 
they cannot find other parking 
spaces. 

She said most offenders may 
be students using the spaces for 
a short time but added that there 
is a parking crisis on campus 
and that more handicap spaces 
are needed. 

She also said if the spaces 
were not illegally lIsed there 

_would probably be a sufficient 
number of handicap spaces on 
campus. 

Both Jenkins and Gimblett 
said that persons illegally using 
placards, especially the tempo-
rary ones, borrow them from rel-
atives and friends with disabili-
ties. 

Jenkins said part of the prob-
lem is the increasing number of 
students enrolling at UCSD.

Office was not avail(lble for com-
ment Wednesday.

STRIKE: 
Union says proposals 
are unacceptable 
ContIaued from .... 1 

In a recent press release the 
union hinted that a strike may be 
imminent. If TAs vote in favor of 
a strike, it could be held at any 
time. 

"As winter quarter finals and 
grading approach, we have the 
opportunity to significantly 
impact the university," stated 
Kristen Guzman, a UAW bar-
gaining team member. 

Hayward said the university 
opposes the idea of a TA strike. 

"We think it's unfair," he said. 
NThe university believes that a 
strike is disruptive to under-
graduate education and is not in 
anyone's interest. We are bar-
gaining in good faith with the 
UAW and our goal remains a 
mutoallr. agreeable contract res--
olution. ' 

The last bargaining session 
between the university and the 
UAW was held Feb. 11. 

According to the UAW, the 
university's proposals were

slated that the university has not 
yet offered improved health ben-
efits for TAs, such as dental and 
vision coverage. rt adqed that the 
university is also resisting a con-
tract that is fully enforceable 
through arbitration. 

After the last bargaining ses-
sion, the union requested that 
negotiations continue on a cam-
pus-by-campus basis instead of 
on a system-wide basis. 

"Because UC's decision-mak-
ing process in consolidated sys-
tem-wide negotiations pro-
duced only an incomplete and 
unacceptable set of offers, we 
are now negotiating at each 
campus," a UAW press release 
stated . "We told UC last Friday 
that if [it] can overcome these 
obstacles and produce an 
acceptable, comprehensive set-
tlement offer on a system:wide 
basis, we are willing to return to 
the system-Wide bargaining 
table." 

Hayward said the university 
is complying with that request. 

· We are happy to proceed on 
that basis," he said. NIt is possible 
that the process will take longer 
but our goal remains the same."

Yandroas seeD\ u though ~R

quality R 6: B that guys &lie to 

seduce women with.) Today, for-
mer New Kids on the Block and 
Micl.ey Mouse Club alumni are 
replaCU\g talented R 6: B artists 
like R. Kelly, Brian McKnight and 
Tony Rich in the mainstream 
music biz. 

In an effort to put an end to 
this madness, Sisqo of Oro Hill 
fame enlisted the help of Def Soul 
records and released his first solo 
album UnltllSh the Dragan. From 
the ~ng to the end, Sisqo's 
first solo effort is an assault on the 
senses that leaves listeners crav-
ing for more. Unltllsh the Drllgon 
is not only composed of 11 beau-
tifully mixed tracks that will put 
the quality of most stereos to the 
test, but is also a showcase of a 
talented group of artists called 
the Oro World Order. Sisqo's 
soaring vocals in each track are 
complemented by the likes of 
Babyface, Beanie Sigel, Lovher, 
Make it Hot and Shae Jones and 
his partner in crime, Dru Hill. 

Even the "rhythm impaired" 
will feel impelled to test their 
dance skills (or lack thereof) on 
tracks such as "Got to Get It," 
"Your Love is lnaedible" and a 
remix of Dru Hill's "You ale

When it comes to metal, 

nobody rocks like MetaUica. And 
believe it or not, they rock just as 
hard accompanied by the San 
Francisco symphony Orchestra. 
This was proven by the recent 
reiuee of 56tM, the two-CD set 
featuring 19 classic Metallica 
tunes and two excellent new 
tracks. 

Like chocolate and peanut 
butter, Metallica and the San 
Francisco Symphony Orchestra 
meld together to create what 
Conductor Michael Kamen, who 
scored films auch as "Die Hard," 
called a "Wagnerian Orgasm." 

(And a Wagnerian Orgasm, as 
anyone who took Music 4 will 
tell you, is sort of a clever nod to 
the German composer Wagner's 
concept of the gestaltkunstwerk, 
or total art work in which multi-
ple forms of musical theater are 
combined to create a more com-
plete . auditority experience.) 
Together, the two musical forces 
generated a rather unique con-
cert experience. The orchestra 
'Consistently and effectively sup-
ports and enhances Metallica's 
classic tunes. 

The first disc kicks off with 
"The Ecstasy of Gold from the 
Good, the Bad and the Ugly" 
soundtrack. This piece serves as 
a particularly effective tune that 
introduces the band members 
and demonstrates quite effective-
ly that the concert isn't just run-
of-the-mill for either group of 
musicians. 

Many of Metallica's well-
known hits are featured on the 
albums. "Fuel," "The Memory 
Remains," "Hero of the Day" and 
"Enter Sandman" are all given a 
refreshingly new and outstand-
ing tune-up with the addition of 
San Francisco Symphony 
Orchestra. 

These complex and superbly 
crafted augmentatiOns by Kamen 
are what give the album its fasci-
nating sound and will keep both 
current and future MetaLlica fans 
enthralled for hours. And 
although James Hetfield was, 
fortunately, not enguUed in a col-
umn of flame during this concert, 
I don't think the band's image as 
metal masters was softened at 
all.

The Gospel Returns 
Ben Harper returns to UCSD with a new message 
.,.,..,LD 
Hiatus Editor 

Ben Harper has returned to 
San Diego with a new gospel to 
preach to the masses. His 1994 
debut album, Welcome to the Cruel 
World, revealed his unique fusion 
of blues, folk, rock, jazz and 
gospel. But, behind the innova-
tive blend of musical styles, lied 
lyrics with a strong and provoca-
tive message. His declarations of 
revolt intensified with Fight for 
Your Mind as well as introducing 
his now famous Weissenborn 
slide guitar to the artist's eclectic 
musical framework. 

Each album ~ed to be an 
evolution of Harper's music as he 
experimented with various styles 
including funk and reggae. And 
although the politics of tus music 
varied from marijuana legalization 
to social isolation, Harper's intense 
lyrical devotion never wavered. 

Harper's newest album, Bum 10 
ShiM, is a testament to the artist's 
expansive, and yet, vulnerable 
nature. Written entilely by Harper, 
Bum 10 ShiM offers a veritable slide 
show to the artist's soul. Spiritual 
meditations on love and God such 
as "The Woman in You" and "Two 
Hands of °a Prayer" divulge the 
internal mechanics clicking 
through Harper's head. 

His trademark voice, a seduc-
tive blend of raw emotion and 
guarded insecurity, has never been 
so honest and open. Yes, the soul is 
there. But, the album's greatest sur-

rise lies in tracks like "Steal My ~" and "Bum to Shine" where 
the man honestly IIOlInds happy. 
They share a playful quality a:td 
leans into an uncharacteristic

Harper from his silent meditations 
to a new found fervor for life.

awES: 
Rogers proves musical style 
is no longer a dark enigma 
COIItInued froIII ..., •• 
echoes are still reverberating today. 

"For the ex-slave, culturally stripped 
of any semblance of Africanness, the 
only thing left was the residue of free-
dom," Rogers said . "This freedom, 
.which expresses the essence of being, or 
soul, takes on the particularities of a pe0-
ple and their folkloric traditions. Blues 
music embodies the barebones of a pe0-
ple through collective memory." 

In the life of the new African Ameri-
can, music played a strong role in devel-
Dring both personal identity and cultur-
a community. It filled a space that was 
rendered empty by forces outside of 
African Americans' control, and the 
music became an expression of strength, 
a way of self-determination and creating 
a new "space." 

Nowadays, the biues encompasses a 
much wider space. In fact, almost all of 
American music today is touched by this 
tradition. 

At his performance, Rogers stated 
between songs, "All Americans have 
been colored by the blues ... rock and 
heavy metal are still blues to me." He 
spoke of Elvis and how that star appro-
priated many tunes from African Ameri-
cans and ' made them a commercial suc-
cess under his name. Instead of feeling 
resentment, Rogers sees Elvis as a mod-
ern version of the mythological 
Prometheus who brought fire (or in this 
case, music) to people who otherwise 
would not have received it, to people 
who desperately needed it. 

"He shook it up!" Rogers said with a 
smile. 

The concert itself started with the 
drummer soloing on a jimbe, a West 
African drum. Rogers sang, "Took away 
the drum/That's how the blues did 
come." 

The first "Bluespeople" were, as 
Rogers puts it, "vanguard vagabonds ... 
a disenfranchised people." He discussed 

.w.. ...... d ift the tJnited 
States among people like Robert John-
son, it was completely acoustic, and 
often involved foot stomping as a means 
to conjure up the drum, this lost ele-
ment. 

Blues was created by people who had 
been marginalized, and the term " the 
blues" had strong connotations. Robert 
Johnson, one of the first recording rural 
blues musicians, was a man "wrapped in 
mystery, wrapped in lore." Back to the 

Ben CooII/GlIMdI." 
................ : The Nubluez Band's 
guitarist plays an electric Blues riff. 

crossroads: The legend goes that Robert 
Johnson sold his soul to the Devil at the 
crossroads outside of town so that he 
could play guitar well. Now he is a leg-
end in himself. Bluespeople like Johnson 
were surrounded by darkness, and so 
was the blues. 

Musicians like Rogers shed light on 
this antiquated idea . He showed at his 
performance that blues is no longer a 
dark enigma, nor shouki it only remind 
us of a brutal history. It is, for him, a 
"source of joy." Roger and his Nubluez 
Band got a room full of people smiling 
and boogying with songs like "No 
Dough," "Heaven's Got the Blues" and 
the "Kennedy Song." "You all want to 
know how Kennedy d ied? /You all want 
to know how Kennedy died? / He was 
the victim of the ultimate drive-by / ... 
Everybody gonna die in the ultimate 
drive-by."

GRIFFEY: 
Homecoming brings 
attention to the Reds 
ContInued from ..... 11 
healthy, the Reds might be right 
up there in the baseball rankings 
with the Indians in Ohio. After a 
lackluster premiere of an Ohio 
franchIse with the Cleveland 
Browns' dismal 2-14 record, 
Midwest fans are primed 
Griffey's opening. 

At first glance, Griffey' 
hometown return takes the cake 
compared to shortstop Ozzie 
Guillen's return. -

Guillen who came back to his 
home in Venezuela after playing 
in the World Series for the 
Atlanta Braves to discover hous-
es and-buildings buried by mud 
slides. 

While one case invlolves cop-
ing with real-life tragedy and the 
other with living up to expecta-
tions on the field of play, both 
men are perceived as heroes --
Guillen because he helped res-
cue people from floods in 
Caracas and Venezuela and 
Griffey because he is already 
seen as the king of the Cincinnati 
Reds. 

The major difference, obvi-
ously, is that Guillen is a hero in 
a more realistic sense. In hearing 
about Griffey constantly before 
he has even hit a single homer 
this year, the cart is clearly com-
ing before the horse. 

The 100 reporters and photog-
raphers on hand at the Reds train-
ing facility pale in comparison to 
the number at Michael Jordan's 
debut in a minor league White 
Sox uniform in 1994. 

There were actually only half 
as many media clowns for 
Griffey's showing. Perhaps 
Jordan is more godly than 
Griffey in the sports scene, but 
the basketball legend was much 
less likely to fire up the baseball 
world with magnificent hitting.

Continued from ..... 11 
two weeks ago. 

"We play up," Sanders said . 
"That's what we want to do -
play better competition ." 

The Tritons already faced 
some tough competition this year. 

"If you look at the games we 
played, we played teams that had 
been together for a while. [Right 
now] we're just getting together," 
Sanders said. We played well in 
those games." 

Sanders sees this process of 
improvement happening right 
now. 

"We're getting a feel; we're 
coming together," he said . 
"People were still trying to figure 
out my new system. We're start-
ing to do some good things. I can 
see this in practice. We have some 
great students. They're intelligent 
and getting it together." 

The Tritons will head back into

Cincinnati is center 
stage in media circus 

To say that Ken Griffey 
Jr: s arrival at training camp 
was not a media circus is to. 
deny the magical aura that 
sports superstars like him 
possess. 

Last Monday, Griffey 
emerged from the Reds club-
house at their spring training 
facility in Cincinnati for the 
first day of workouts. 

People may think that he 
made his first appeamce of 
the 2000 season by sauntering 
into ca,p after parking his 
plush car and walking onto 
the field like Willie Mays 
Hayes from the movie "Major 
League." However, the truth 
is that he came out to play in 
the midst of the media frenzy 
in quite a modest fashion by 
practically sneaking into the 
clubhouse. 

Later on, reporters and the 
media hounded him with 
questions as usual, but 
Griffey sat tight through it all 
- accepting the routine as 
part of his job. 

What was not ordinary 
about an All-Star slugger 
being interviewed by a large 
group of reporters is that it 
was happening in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. 

Griffey was probably enjoy-
ing all the formalities of his first 
unofficial appearance in red 
because he was being celebrat-
ed in his hometown. 

It was unlike, for example, 
Terrell Davis playing in the 
Super Bowl at Qualcomm 
Stadium in 1998. San Diego was 
the city where he grew up and 
became a football star in high 
school. 

Unlike Davis, Griffey has his 
hometown to stay in for more 
than a weekend. He will be 
interviewed and written about 
in a spotlight that may end up 
becoming all too familiar to 
him. Drawing on past stories of 
Griffey's greatness and his 
father Ken Sr., who played for 
the Reds in the 70s, the local 
media will go to lunch with 
Griffey all year long. 

However, th~ city of 
Cincinnati and Reds fans 
probably do not mind. 

The city is proud of their 
team getting more coverage 
nationwide and likely going 
from relative mediocrity in the 
1990 World Series to stardom 
this season. It might take a 
while for one man's stardom to 
djffuse throughout the team as 
a whole. 

Griffey and the Reds have 
it good because the press in 
Midwest cities do not tend to 
put the kind of pressure on 
their athletes as L.A . or New 
York reporters do. 

That is why the Reds will 
do even better this year after 
a solid 97-65 record last year. 
With a lineup featuring 
Griffey, Dante Bichette, Sean 
Casey and a respectable 
pitching staff that could be a 
threat to the power hitters on 
the clubs of central division 
rivals if Pete Harnisch stays

Women's Water Polo Wins Again 
REBOUND: After losing their first seven, the Tritons' bounce back to win two in a row 
. y ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

Perhaps the beginning of the 
season was just a warm-up fur the 
women's water polo team. After 
losing its first seven contests in a 
row, the team finally found its 
stroke. 

UCSD won its second match in 
a row, 11-6, at a home game 
against UC Santa Cruz at the 
Canyonview Pool. Behind the 
deadly duo of Emma Kudritzki 
and Samara Silverman, the 
Tritons overwhelmed the visitors 
as each notched four goals en 
route to victory. 

"[Kudritzki and Silverman 
are] both play-makers for the 
team. They're both mobile on 
offense and capable on defense." 
women's water polo Head Coach 
Larry Sanders said. "[Silverman] 
is a freshman. She's very mobile, 
and she's active at both ends." 

Kudritzki showed why she is 
the Tritons' leading scorer this 
season by logging four scores. 

"[Kudritzki] makes the most 
of opportunities," Sanders said. 
"She's a team leader in the pool. 
She's someone I look to [in order 
to) get the team together." 
. Hilary Smith also 'contributed 
to the score with two goals and 
Courtney Hemmerly logged one 
point. 

"[Smith) is a team leader," 
Sanders added. 

On Saturday, the Banana Slugs 
had their minds elsewhere as 
they could not match UCSD's fire 
power. 

Maria Zavala led the visitors 
with just three goals, Wendy 
Johnson tossed in two and Jiny 
Kun tallied one. 

UCSC actually took an early 1-
o lead, but that was the end of its 
highlight reel for the day. UCSD 
then took a 2-1 lead before it 
opened the flood gates and made 
things worse for the Banana 
Slugs. The Tritons talHed three 
goals in a lopsided second quar-

their advantage over Santa Cruz However, by the time the Tritons' 
as they out-scored UC5C, 2-1, in 11-6 victory was sealed, the squad 

was undoubtedly exhausted. 
"( felt that part of [the slow 

start] was because we had two 
long weekends in a TOW. ( think 
that they were a little tired. We

Sanders said.

Men's Tennis Team Wins a Pair 
ROAD TRIP: UCSD heads up north and returns with victories over DC Riverside and Chapman 
., •• u.au ..... 
Sports Editor 

Over the wet weekend, the 
men's tennis team traveled up 
Interstate 5 to play against three 
Southern California rivals. 

On Friday afternoon, the 
Tritons took on UC Riverside. 
Despite the fact that Riverside is 
a Division II school, the match 
was easily won by the Division 
III Tritons with a score of 6-l. 

UCSD won two of the three 
doubles pro-sets and won the 
doubles point. 

Cory Moderhak and Mike 
Rosell won at No. 1 doubles, Dan 
Albrecht returned from an injury 
and played with Michael Meyer 
at No. 2 doubles. The pair dis-
patchec! t.heir 0yponents, 8-5, for 
their first win 0 the year. 

"Dan has had a shoulder prob-
lem but it seems to have gone 
away now," Triton Head Coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said. "We did 
not want to stress hi body by 
making him play singles after not 

playing for three weeks." 
In singles, the llitons won five 

of the six matches to solidify their 
victory. The singles competition 
was highlighted by Meyer's 6-0, ~ 
o shellacking in the No.1 singles. 

With one victQry firmly 
in hand, the Tritons then 
traveled 20 miles to 
take on Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

This match did 
not go as well, and 
the team eventually fell 
by a score of 2-7. 

"I knew that they would be 
improved but 1 was disapPOinted in 
our doubles pertormance," 
Steidlmayer said. ''We didn't execute 
our shots the way we usually do." 

In doubles, UCSD went 1-2. 
with the only victory coming 
from Albrecht and Meyer in the 
No.2 doubles. 

In singles, the llitons had an 
even harder time. Of the six single 
matches, only Cory Moderhah 
No. 2 singles ended in victory. 

In its ihird match of the wet'.k-

end, the Tritons went to 
Chapman on Saturday afternoon 
to take on Chapman University. 

Despite haVing played two 
matches in the previous day and a· 

hall, the team showed no. signs 
of being tired as they rolled 

over Chapman, ~ 1. 
In the doubles the 

Tritons swept 
Chapman to win the 
only doubles point. 
Albrecht and Meyer, 

moved up to No. 1 dou~ 
bles and were triumphant 

with a score of 8-5. The win 
gave the pair a 3-0 record for the , 
weekend. 

Moderhak and Scott Anderson 
played at No.2 · and destroyed 
their opponents 8-(), An Frankel 
and Ryan Thompson won, 8-1, at 
No.3 doubles. 

Although Meyer fell at No. 1 
Singles, the rest managed to win 
their matches. 

Moderhak took little time in 
dismantling his opponent, 6-0, ~ 
0, in the No.2 Singles. 

"I've got to give Michael credit 
for the weekend he had," 
Steid1mayer said. "He's been bat-
tling injury but he fought through 
it. The injury definetely contributed 
to his loss against Cal Poly." 

Sean Higginbotham also 
rolled into straight-set victories at 
No. 3 singles. The win was 
Higginbotham's first of the week-
end in three matches. 

Thompson and Anderson easi-
ly won at No. 4 and No.6 singles, 
respectively, but the highlight of 
the match was Ari Frinkel's 
matchup at No.5 singles. 

Frankel took the first set in a 
tie breaker and fell, 6-1, in the 
second set. The third set was a 
battle of attrition with Frankel 
eventually winning in another 
tie-brea ker. 

Their i-1 weekend ran the 
Triton's season record to 3-2. 1-0 in 
Division Ill. 

UCSD's next match is 2 p.m. on 
Friday against ~m New 
Mexico University at the Muir 
North Courts.
