The CostofUCB 
The University Center 

Board (UCB) has been the 
focus of much anention and 
controversy this year, 
seemingly unable to get out 
from under the thumb of the 
administration. But the 
board accomplished a great 
deal, forcing the university 
to look at the question of 
student autonomy. Howev-
er, the UCB's successes 
have been tempered by 
some failures, such as its 
tendency to pass silly and 
meaningless resolutions 
while ignoring serious daily 
issues / PAGE 4

By Joanne Donahoe 
Staff Writer 

TIle A sociated Student Election Review Board 
postponed its hearing of A.S. presidential candidate 
Ruben Duran' case again t opponent Mike Holmes 
Thursday because of que tions about election bylaws. 

Before testimony began early Thursday morning, 
Holmes asked Election Manager Jennifer Aaim to 
postpone the hearing until Duran gave Holmes informa-
tion on the specifics of the case. 

"What am I being accused of? .... It's not on the 
violation report," Holme asked. 

Duran charged Holmes with violating election by-

Town MeetingAddresses Riots in Los Angeles 
By David Snow 
Staff Writer 

In response to the recent up-
heaval in Los Angeles, panelists 
and concemed individuals from 
UCSD and the surrounding com-
munity gathered Thursday evening 
for a "Race Relations Town Meet-
ing" at UCSD' s Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 

Rim Studies. 
The panelists represented vari-

ous academic fields which tudy 
i sues relevant to the violent and 
destructive reaction to the Rodney 
King verdict. Each presented a brief 
and sober analysis of the riots, and 
suggested factors that may have led 
to their outbreak. 

Assistant Professor of Sociol-

ogy Ivan Evans suggested that "dei-
fication of the free market" by the 
Reagan and Bush administrations 
are potential causes of economic 
discontent among inner-city poor. 

"When groups fail in the market, 
the blame is laid on the characteris-
tics of that group, and the market is 
above reproach," Evan said. 

Evans. a native of South Africa. 

said he sees that race remains a 
"deep-seated phobia" in America. 
and that unless action is taken, mce 
relations will continue to decline. 

Several of the panelists said that 
the recent upheaval also underlined 
the need for greater understanding 
between different minority group ..

Two Professors Elected to Science Academy 

~lected NAS member Dr. Stephen Heinemann. 

• UCSD biologist, bioengineer 
named to prestigious NAS 
By Stephanie Danford 
Staff Wn(er 

Even at the age of 10. UCSD Adjunct 
Professor Stephen Heinemann kept a sci-
ence lab. His long-time interest in science 
has helped him to be elected to the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS) along with his 
colleague, Profe sor Emeritus of Bioengi-
neering Y.c. Fung. 

Heinemann currently serves as director 
of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory 
at the Salk Institute. 

Fung conducts research in rheology, or 
the science of flow and change of fluids and 
matter. 

The National Academy of Sciences wa~ 
established in 1863 by a congres. ional act of 
incorporation igned by Pre ident Abraham 
Lincoln. 

The organization was created to act as an 
official adviser to the federal government in 
any matter of cience or technology. 

Since joining the Salk Institute in 1970. 
Heinemann has been conducting research 
on neurotransmitters in the brain that could 
give doctors insight on psychiatric di or-
ders. 

Heinemann said he pend! much of his 
time in the lab teaching and upervising the 
work of po t-doctorate fellows. 

A a member of the NAS. Heinemann 
will serve as a consultant to the government.

UCSD ScIentIst finds Use of 'Um' 
And 'Uh' In Lecture Maybe Inevitable 

Attemp(S to avoid using "urn" and "er" may be futile for 
even the most erudite, according to UCSD psychologist 
Nicholas Ouistenfeld. 

"It is an interesting phenomonenon. Almost everybody 
uses 'UJrui' hundreds of times each day - with no obvious 
purpose," said Christenfeld, who specializes in speech 
dis fluency. 

'Ums', or filled pauses, warrant an investigation be> 
cause they are -'a public behav ior thai can occur up to 900 
times an hour," Cluistenfeld said. In fact, every cullUn: 
seems to use some fonn of 'wn.' 

Acceptingtheviewthal 'UJrui' and 'uhs' signal 'timeout' 
while the speaker searches for the next word or phrase, the 
researchers reasoned that the more options provided by the 
subject matter, the more often a speaker will utter an ·um.' 

To test their hypothesi, tnJjned "urn coders" S31 in on 
lectures inten academic disc ipl ines and counted lhenumber 
of time the instructors said "um." 

In a paper published last year in the Journal of Ptr-
sOllaliry and Social Psychology, Christenfeld and his ad-
visor reported that literature professors and an historians 
"ummed" three-and-a-half times mon: often than did bi-
ologists and mathematicians. 

Natural scientists averaged 1.39 'uhs' per minute, s0-
cial scientists 3.84, and humanists 4.8S. 

The results came as no surprise to the researchers. "'The 
academic disciplines differ markedly in the extent to 
which . .. a speaker is required to choose among options. In 
the pure sciences .. . there are relatively few options." 
Christenfeld wrote. 

As an example, the researchers cited E--mc2, a formula 
for which there are no oplions. "In contrast. consider the 
statement, 'what Shakespeare probably meant in that 
pal ~ge from Lear was .... ' The options seem limitless." 

Along the same lines, certain tenn in the hard sciences,

Scripps Researchers DIscover New 
Method of Underwater DetectIon 

Naturally occurring sounds in the ocean , produced as a 
result of bubbles fonning near the surface, are the key to a new 
method of underwaJer~ection being developed by scientists 
at UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and the 
Rorida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Rorida. 

Wriling in the Mar. 25 issue of Naluu, the scientists re-
ported success with a method involving listening to underwa-
ter noise and translating thai noise into simple video images. 

For many years, the principal means of probing the ocean 
using sound has been through the use of passive or active 
sound techniques. For example, with an active sysaem such as 
sonar, an object is ilIwninaled by a pulse of sound which 
echoes off the object. 

A passive system involves listening to lhe noise emitted by 
the object itself. such as engine noise. 

"What we are proposing is a new method of employing 
sound that is neither active nor passive," said Michael 
Buckingham, a marine physicist at SIO. "It n:lies OIl the 
naturally occurring ambient noise field in the ocean as the sole 
source of acoustic illumination." 

Noisein the ocean iscreared by breaking surface waves that 
create a large number of noisy bubbles. 

Because the sound of bubbles is dispersed to great depths, 
Buckingham compares it to unlight., which spreads evenly to 
all available space. Buckingham thus coined the term "acous-
tic daylight" to describe the noise field. 
Silicon's AbIlity to Emit Ught Sends 
Scientists Searching for Application 

Long considered optically dead, silicon is now captivating 
its most fervent fans with an almost my tical and previously 
unseen ability to emit visible light, according to a UCSD study. 

Thi illuminating feat. accomplished with acid-etched 
wafers of porous silicon, has set off an intellectual chain 
reaclionaround the world-including UCSD-among those

ties for exploiting its properties," the researchers aid. 
TIle silicon fervor began last April when British and 

French scientists unveiled its ability toanit light. 
According to their report, the researchers sculpted pun: 

silicon inw a forest of very thin pillars through a imple 
chemical etching process. When this porous silicon was 
stimulated with a laser, it emitted an intense orange-yellow 
glow, a phenomenon never seen befon::. 

If porous silicon could be used to crea&e cheap and 
efficient "quantum wires," used to generale energy of 
certain wavelengths, a new generation of microelectronic 
devices would be at hand. 

However, not everyone agrees thai silicon's glow is 
produced by quamwn effects of specified energy. Some 
believe the glow might be caused by a silicon oxide sitting 
on the marcrial's surface. 

"It's still open to question whetheryoucou1d get porous 
silicon to be used commercially in electro-optics," Sailor 
said.

Psychiatry Department Receives 
Millions to Research Schizophrenia 
By KMIn Chene 
Guardian Reporter 

Up to $3 million has been allo-
cated to the UCSD Depanment of 
Psychiatry to stlllt a major research 
study of mental illness, especially 
schizophrenia, in the elderly. 

The money will tlJnd research 
thai may provide more clues on the 
causes and effects of schizophre-
nia, its relation to other brain dis-
eases like Alzheimer's and the use 
of anti-psychotic drugs on schizo. 
phrenic patients. 

This is the third study at UCSD 
to be funded by the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health. 

Lewis Judd, chair of UCSD's 
Psychiatry Depanment, and Dilip 
Jeste, the new program director, 
will head the research project. 

Schizophrenia is a high priority 
for federal research. Jeste said, be-
cause it is believed to affect at least 
one out of every 100 people. "It is

formation on the election commit-
tee forms" and failing to accurately 
record the number of flyers he had 
printed. 

According to Duran, all the in-
formation Holmes needs is on the 
complaint form filed by Dunin, ex-
cept for the date and times of the 
alleged violations. 

Duran read the chargesto Holmes 
and Raim, and said, "lbose are my 
charges. I don't want to get into 
specifics. That 's why [ called this 
case." 

Holmes refuted Duran's argu-
ments, saying that all defendants 
have the right to know what they are 
being accused of, who the witnesses 
are and what the evidencc to be used 
against them is. 

"I need to be able to respond to 
specific charges. I ask this commit-
tee to [recess until Duran) can lay 
out the specific charges for me," 
Holmes said. 

Flaim could not speculate on 
when the case will be resolved or 
when the ballots will be tabulated. 

Raim criticized the A.S. elec-
tion bylaws, saying ,that they were 
written in 1985 and have not been 
revised since. 

She says she feels the problems 
with this electiOll campaign can be 
attributed to the unclear and ineffec-
tive bylaws. 

important, from a public health view-
point. because there is no cure for 
schizophrenia, and therefore, it is 
probably the mo t expensive men-
Ial illness in terms of treatment cost, 
ho pitaJization, public assistance 
and lost productivity," Jeste said. 

The research will concentrate on 
two groups of patients, those who 
developed schizophrenia when they 
wen: over the age of 4S, and those 
who developed the disorder when 
they were under age 45. It will also 
slUdy Alzheimer's patients and a 
normal control group. The study 
will be conducted in the research 
centers in the Veteran's Adminis-
tration Hospital, primarily on war 
veterans. 

Research should begin as soon 
as finances and facilities are estab-
lished for the five-year project,prob-
ably as early as Oct. I. 

Schizophrenia is one of the most 
severe psychiatric disorders, char-

According to Raim. the bylaws 
do not srate the rights of defendants 
to know the evidence against them. 

She also said the bylaws are 
ambiguous as to how long the de-
fendant and plaintiff can speak at a 
hearing and the exact process of 
questioning the witnesses. 

"Years have gone by where no-

body questioned whether these by-
laws were fair or not," Raim said. "I 
think the bylaws need to be there 
ahead of time. We can't just fabri-
cate the bylaws to fit a situation." 

Holmes argued that dales and 
times of his alleged improprieties 
are important, and as a defendant he 
is allowed to know with what viola-
tion he is being charged. 

According to Dunin, Holmes 
tried to questiOll him weeks before

Psychiatric Association originally 
thought that schizophreniacould not

years, they have changed theirthink-

Although schizophrenia is not a 
fatal disease, there is a high uicide 
rate among scizophrenics. Accord-
ing to Jeste, there are three direc-
tions in which palients can ultimately 
develop. 

"Some patients, as they get older, 
actually get bener. They improve so 
much that some of them no longer

he felt it would not be in his own best 
interests. 

DespiteDuran'sanempt tocon-
tinue with the hearing, Holmes in-
sisted that to continue the hearing 
would be unfair because he had 
been unable to prepare for it. He 
maintained Ihat he could only an-
ticipate what Duran's arguments 
would be based on rumors. 

The hearing is now in rece s 
until all plllties involved can meet 
again to complete it. 

An hour after the hearing was 
recessed, Duran turned in a revised 
copy of the violation repon which 
contained the specific dates of 
Holme 'alleged election impropri-
eties. 

Dunin,Raim and Holmes agreed 
that the case would be better re-
solved by the A.S. Judicial Board. 

Dunin has filed a Judicial Board 
complaint against Aaim which re-
quests that the Judicial Board, in-
stead of the Elections Review Com-
mittee, hear the Duran II. Holmes 
case. 

Raim had also previously sent a 
request toA.S.Judicial Board Chair 
Gloria Corral, arguing that a fair 
hearing could not be held by the 
Elections Review Committee under 
the current bylaws. 

According to Holmes, the Judi-
cial Board would be bener struc-
tured for the hearing. 

No action has yet been taken 
toward moving the case to the A.S. 
Judicial Board.

Tales From the Boardroom 
The University Center Board has accomplished much over 

the past year - at the cost of its own respectability 
By francisco DeVries 
Staff Writer 

After six months of non-stop wrangling 
with Ihe university administration. it is 
time 10 look back at what the University 
Center Board (UCB) has actually accom-
plished. 

The UCB succeeded in injecting 
!>tudent input into an administration 
woefully lacking in that department, 
opening the door 10 genuine student 
control over fee-funded facilities and 

rai~ing some much-needed hell. But in the 
process. the board ceded much of its 
already meager power to the administrJ-
tion. passed a number of meaningless 
resolutions which did little except elicit 
laughter from the campu , the Guurd;clIl 
Editorial Board and the admini tration. 
and ultimately lo~t sight of its duty to 
represent all ,tudent!>. 

I can still remember watching the 
board. during a meeting on March 2. :b it 
came within a hair' s b~ldth of voting to 
reject the contmcts for Price Center Food 
Vendors - Wendy·s. Espresso Roma. el. 
al. - because they got three-year exten-
sions while the co-ops only got one-year 
extensions. These contracts had been 
negotiated over the coun.c of three month 
and were completely reasonable. 

However. some board members felt 
that the extension~ constituted preferential 
treatment and wanted the ~me agreement 
with the co-ops - a reawnable de ire. 
Since the board could not extend the co-op 
agreements, it wanted to make a point by 
~I:bhing the Price Center contracts. 
Sounds good. except ac ording to board 
members involved in the original negotia-
tions. it would have forced many of the 
food court businesses to close and those 
vendors are a large source of in ome for 
the board. The contract finally passed 

four to three with two ab tentions. 
The cariest part about this is that the 

board was prepared to throwaway three 
months of negotiations wi thout any 
con ideration of what impact such a move 
would have financially. This is rather 
alarming. e peciaJly if the UCB ever doe 
get the power to make and enforce such 
ludicrous and poorly considered decisions. 

But before looking at the board' 

c o M M E 

Mel MalceloiGuardian 

shortcomings. it would be best to consider 
some of its positive accomplishments. 

First. the UCB before thi year 
operated mo tly in darkness - hardly 
anyone on campus knew what it was. 
much less what it did. Nonetheless, the 
UCB commands (or, if one believe the 
administration. advises) a $3 million 
budget cons isting mostly of student fees. 

I agree with the assessment of outgoing 

N T A R y 

UCB Chair Molly McKay. "What I am 
really pleased about with the UCB is that 
no one knew what it was before this year. 
it was like a closed network." she said. 
"[Now) tudent will be watching it, as 
well they should." 

Increased student awareness about the 
board and the battles it is fighting creates a 
much-needed medium for students to 
approach the university administration. 
Students now know to go to the UCB 
when they face a silly bureaucratic rule 
they want to get around. 

Second. the door has been opened to 
long-sought-after student autonomy and 
student control over self-assessed fees . 
John Francis. one of the best lawyers in 
the state pecializing in student rights 
issues, has agreed to work for the board 
pro /)0 110. m stly because of the 
administrJtion's refusal to deal reasonably 
with legal questions posed by the board in 
the last year. 

The university maintained that the 
UCB could not retain outside legal counsel 
for two reasons. First. it was part of the 
university. and therefore. it would be 
impossible for the university to sue itself. 
Second. the board had access to University 
Counselloanna Beam for any legal 
questions that it might have. biased though 
such counsel may be. 

Then. in a mystifying move, the 
administration said that it was tired of the 
UCB always bothering its counsel and 
demanded that any further legal questions 
be directed to University Center Director 
Jim Carruthers. That completely under-
mined the administration's already shaky 
argument that the board already had legal 
counsel. Obviously, if he felt so inclined, 
Carruthers could pass on the questions to 
Beam. But in the administration's opinion

The Politics of Parasites and Humans-To-Be 
By Suzanne Carr 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

TIle same general group that calls for 
legislation to protect life in old-growth 
forests. spotted owls, harp seals. dolphins. 
as well as human criminal on death row. 
also calls for legislation to allow the 
killing of unborn human fetuses. What a 
double standard! The tiny green bud of a 
rose is not con idered a weed before it 
blossoms. but a rose-ta-be. The tiny pink 
bud of a fetu i not a parasitic lump of 
cells before it is born, but a human-to-be! 
Since when is a pecies' own fetus a 
parasite? A fetu is a human, no more 
parasitic than a two-rnonth-old infant. 

A fetus is the most helpless sort of 
humanity that exi ts. Not even a person 
on life-support or a prematurely born 
infant i so fragile and so dependent on 
another. Their lungs cannot yel breathe 
air, their kin cannot tolerate much 
besides warm amniotic fluid and dark-
ness. We take advantage of this helpless-
ness. this voicele ne of a human, to 

" t", •• ,. " I ,. " .f • 

kill it at our choice. 
I saw four or five young women the 

other day, hanging up a pnxhoice rally 
banner on the gymnasium wall. They 
were young and pretty women. Have lhey 
had abortion ? Do they want to have one 
in their future? Do they want their future 
children 10 consider themselves lucky 10 
have arrived on the scene at a convenient 
time? Most of these women are women of 
conscience. Do they want a death on their 
conscience? 

TIlese young women have not seen 
film of a four-week-old fetus, curled about 
its new beating heart. They have not seen 
ultrasonographs of an eight-week-old 
fetus jumping around inside the uterus. 
They have not seen other fetuses outside 
the womb, cut to bits by a scalpel, or burnt 
black over the course of three hours by a 
saline bath (a long. slow death), or 
ruptured with a vacuum. If they haven't 
considered these things. then they know 
nothing. They know nothing, and there are 
.those who wish them to know nothing. 

TIlere are many doctors who perform 
abortions who stand to lose a great deal 
of money if women realize exactly what 
abortion is. Abortion is the only opera-
tion which is not described to the patient 
in precise detail beforehand, and there is 
an agenda behind this. 

Perhaps women who have already 
swallowed the bitter pill of abortion also 
seek to make it socially acceptable, in 
order to rationalize their own ordeal. I 
have nothing but ympathy for these 
women, and I urge any who have been in 
this position to face their personal grief, 
rather than try to influence others to join 
in their company of anger and agony.' 

The current issue before the Supreme 
Court is one primarily of information. If 
it pertains to human rights as well, we 
must also extend this to the rights of tile 
growing baby. If it is a maner of 
women's rights. then consider how many 
women-to-be are being cut or burned or 
ruptured without their permi~~ion, at thi 
very moment. What abortion-rights 

activists are seeking is the total silencing 
of the unborn child: disallowing clinics 
and doctor.> to suggest to pregnant 
women that their babies are well-formed 
and very active in the womb by the time 
they've missed their two periods. 

If we do not inform potential 
recipients of abortion about the exact 
nature of their operation. we condemn 
them to a possibly devastating future. in 
which they must confront their role as an 
accessory to the murder of their own 
child_ As abortion damages the uterine 
wall, they may also never be able to 
have another child. The uhrasonograph 
machine is a widely available tool, often 
used by doctors to guide their hands as 
they perform abortions. Giving women 
Ihi5 information is likely 10 c:Iis.suOOe them 
from aborting their baby. They may 
instead decide to keep their baby. and they 
will know that they have saved a life. 

Who am I to speak? A feminist, a 
democrat. and a Jew. who respects 
liberty and life.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Judicial System, Not the Jury, Is Responsible for King Verdict 
Editor: 

I am writing this leiter in response to the 
editorial "An Outrageous Deci ion" (May 
4). First. let me make it abundantly clear that 
I think the four officers who were tried for 
the beating of Rodney King are guilty and 
ought to be rotting in jail right now. How-
ever, I would like to point out that this is a 
failure of tile United States legal system, not 
of the 12 jurors who participated in that trial. 

Before we decide to crucify the jurors 
from the Rodney King trial. let's take a look 
at some of tile facts. To begin with, the laws 
dealing with excessive force and police bru-
tality are unclear at best The instructions 
given to the jury are basically twofold. TIle 
judge first informs them thataguilty verdict 
should only be rendered if a juror feels that 
the defendents are guilty beyond any 
reasonable doubt. 

It is the second portion of the instruc-
tions, however, that may have brought about 
the verdict of not gUilty. This section con-
sists of the technical requirements for ren-
dering a gUilty plea for the specific charges 
against the defendants. 

I have heard, albeit second-hand, that the 
rendering of a guilty verdict in cases of 

police brutality require a unanimous decision 
by the jurors on exactly which blow consti-
tuted exce ive force. 

Having seen the infamous videotape. I 
doubt that any twelve individuals could agree 
on exactly which blow marked the beginning 
of excessive force. Even if this information is 
inaccurate. I think the principle itself remains 
valid. 

At this point. some might ask,"WelI,given 
the brutality of the crime, whydidn ' tthejurors 
simply find them guilty anyway?" I claim that 
such an abuse of power in pursuit of justice 
would be no benerthan that of the four police 
officers who took justice into their own hands. 
If"thesystem"failstodeliverju tice. we need 
to change that system, not attack the people 
who work within it. 

Mathue Moyer 

Lack of Justice in Verdict 
Is Not an Issue of Race 
Editor: 

Racism is a controversial issue, and the 
news media improves its ratings by showing 
any controversial issue. The beating by police 
of a drug-crazed felon is oply controversial if 

one takes note of the races involved. Believe 
it or not. white drug-crazed felons who have 
broken parole have also gotten beaten by 
police. Butthe news media won't show us that 
hundreds of times. Why not? Because mo ( 
people don't care much about drug-crazed 
felons. 

Why show Rodney repeatedly? Because 
racism equalscontrover.>y equals ratings. The 
news programs competed with each other in 
showing the final stage (controversial stage) 
of the beating hundreds of times. and yet 
almost never howed the other side of the 
tory. 

This led most people to asswne that there 
simply wasn 'tanotherside to thestory, and so the 
jury'sverdictwascompletelysurprisingtothem. 

Justice wasn 't present in the trial against 
the police officers involved in the Rodney 
King beating. Since when has there ever been 
justice in our legal system? Murderers, thieves. 
and rapists of all different colors and creeds 
get off on technicalities and fancy lawyering 
literally every day. 

1be fact that there is little justice in our 
legal system is not a racial is ue, although the 
press will try to report it as such. 

1be fact is, the officers were given due 

proces under the con titution and found in-
nocent. By definition. therefore. they are in-
nocent, since there has been no fairer way 
devised in history to make this deci ion. 

The protesters want to throw due process 
and the con titution out the window when it 
doesn'l gotheir way . .. they wouldrathertrust 
the press. and make their judgment accord-
ingly. 

So was the entire incident void of true 
raci m? Unfortunately not. since during the 
L.A. riots the racists showed their lack of 
intelligence. They dragged innocent people 
from cars and beat them to death just because 
of their race. and they burned down and 
looted providers of goods and services in their 
own community. 

TIle racists also singled out Korean store 
and business owners in their arsonist attacks. 
Because of this, the selective attacks on Ko-
rean businesses certainly would have made 
Dr. Martin Luther King sick. 

Also, as a non-racist. he surely would have 
looked at the siluation surrounding the Rodney 
King beating before taking note of the races 
involved. But then again. he was too smart to 
be a good target for news media hype.

. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Abortion Commentary Contained Raws, Illogical Assumptions 
Editor: 

Miguel Buckenmeyer's "Abor-
tion and the Truth" (April 27) con-
tainssorrmny flaws that I would like 
to address only a few of them. First 
of all,) find nothing more ridiculou 
than the statement that before the 
20th century. language was "only 
used to describe reality simply" and 
that afterwards it "has done every-
thing but [ ic] describe reality." As 
nored by the late linguist Dwight 
Bolinger, ever since its develop-
ment, language has been used to 
clarify as well as distort what we 
con ider as "reality." 

Second, Buckenmeyer rightly 
pointsoutthat Mu solini, Hitlerand 
Stalin "were all masters in corrupt-
ing language." But what he fails to 
make reference to is the fact that all 

three were stringently anti-abortion 
and made it illegal for a women to 
have one. 

Third. Buckenmeyerneglect to 
analyze an even more vulgar term 
used by those who label themselves 
as "pro-life." Why doesn't this de-
scription come under the scope of 
"the corruption of language?" Are 
we to bel ieve that the majority of the 
U.S. population is "against life" 
because they feel that a women has 
the right to choose whether or nor 
he wants to end her pregnancy? 

Fourth, with regard to the issue 
of constitutional protection,) would 
like to point out that it i only a 
matter of opinion that the fetus con-
stitutes a person. TIlere is no clear 
scientific or medical evidence that 
prove a three month-old fetu is an 

acrua1 person and that it thu de-
serves equal protection under the 
U.S. Con titution. 

Jin Suh Jim 

Pro-Choice Is Immoral 
Editor: 

I'm writing in response to the 
two editorial responses made on 
April 30 by Stephanie Blank and 
Parou haZand. Zandstates, "Every 

FOOD 
FOR 

FEE T 
FLIIIII 

woman needs to decide for herself 
when he feels life begins." 

How can one's personal opin-
ions, which differ from one person 
to the next, be the sole criteria upon 
which the definition of a human life 
rests? Is this not akin to saying, " It' 
up to every Nazi to decide whether 
Jews have human rights or not?" 
Whether you believe abortion i 
immoral or not, certainly thedefini-
tion of human life cannot be so 
nebulous. 

Next is the old argument. "I don't 
believe in abortion, but I do believe 
in a right to choose. "ll1e only rea-
son I can see for being opposed to 
abortion is because one considers it 
an act of murder. And if it is such, 
then how can such ·a "c:hoice" be 
morally permissible? 

As for Ms. Blank.. she assens 
that, "The pro-life movement is, in-
effect, anti-life, pro·death of the 
pregnant mother." I know) person-
ally am not"pro-death" of the preg-
nant mother, nor is allyolle I have 
met in association with the pro-life 
movement. which includes several 
women who have been in that posi-
tion. 

Based on the research that I have 
done, it is clear that life does nor 
instantaneously begin at the mo-
ment of birth, but one thing is cer-
tain: that is the only point at which a 
human child is protected from abor-
tion by law. 

Don't believe me? Call the 
Woman Care clinic. That's what I 
did.

BOARD 
ContInued from .... 4 
all the important questions have been 
answered. 

Carruthers told me last week that 
"the board has legal opinion, they 
just don't like it .. , I think the ques-
tions have been addressed" 

The situation is obviously unsat-
isfactory, and Francis, the new UCB 
anorney, was convinced that he 
needed to help the board out of this 
quagmire. With his help, I believe 
that the administration has nailed 
shut its own coffin. 

Third, the UCB raised hell. It 
told the administration that it can no 
longer go galloping around without 
any accountability to the students. It 
has scared the administrators into 
being much less cavalier. 

The problem with all of the 
board's successes is that they came 
at a great, and unnecessary, cost. 

First, the UCB gave up much of 
its control over day-t<Hlay opera-
tions while it debated endlessly over 
resolutions that everyone knew 
would be rejected out ofhand by the 
administration. 

This ceding of authority angered 
GSA President and Graduate Stu-
dent Representative Denise Fenton. 
'This board is worse than last year's 
board in the sense that they have 
done absolutely nothing," she said. 

Various projects McKay pro-
posed when she took over the board 
last year were never accomplished. 
Other day-to-day operations were 
adversely affected by the board's 
persistence in its quest for autonomy. 
McKay defended the board. saying 
that "the most important things are 

the larger issue , the fundamental 
issues about student control over 
their fee funded facilities... if the 
co-ops disappeared it really doesn't 
matter if the post office stays open 
until 3 or 4 o'clock." 

The best way to deal with the ~ 
lems would be to take the middle 
ground. Thatcould have been found if 
the board hadn't spent so much time 
on meaningless resolutions. 

TIle UCB was right in demand-
ing that Jim Carruthers' salary be 
paid by the administration. He is 
clearly not under board directive 
and it looks awful for the university 
to force students to pay directly for 
his salary against their expressed 
will. Carruthers' salary epitomizes 
the university 's disrespect for stu-
dent sentiments. 

The board was also right in push-
ing forwanl withasweepingnewchar-
ter. The existence of a fonnal docu-
ment that states the UCB's intentions 
legitimizes their bid for more power. 

But that was about it - most ev-
erything else Wa<i useless and under-
mined the board's respectability. Es-
pecially out of line were the thinly-
veiled but ultimately empty threats, 
like the one that guaranteed free space 
for the co-ops if the administration 
acted against them again. Passage of 
that resolution back in early Man:h 
prompted widespread laughter and a 
resounding "when hell freezes over" 
from the administration. 

TIle attempt to change the name 
of the Student Center to the "Stu-
dent Cooperative Center" was an-
other example of useless and mean-
ingless legislation. It is a long-estab-
lished policy that any buildingnarne 
change must go through a commit-

The UCSD Guardian 

tee completely separate from the 
UCB. Nowhere in either the new or 
old charters does it give the UCB 
power to name buildings. Frankly, 
it looked silly trying. 

The board hoold have spentthat 
time working on things that it al-
ready controlled - the post office 
was one issue, making Mac's Place 
profitable was another. 

And finally, the board lost track 
of its duty to represent the entire 
rudent body. Its muddled try at 

slashing Price Center lease agree-
ments underscores that problem. 
Sure, a lot of students like the Grove 
Caffe better than the Espresso Roma, 
but everybody's interests must be 
looked after. 

Since we can't go back intime, it 
is important to look to the future. 
The UCB needs - and I know this 
sounds evil and conservative - to 
get along with the administration. It 
is now time for everyone to get on 
with their lives and let the lawyers 
work out the details. Francis is a 
damned good lawyer-ifautonomy 
is possible, he will gel it. There is 
nothing the UCB can do except 
make itself look foolish until it has 
the powertomake its decisions st ick. 

Ibelievethauhe UCB will get its 
long sought-after power. At that 
time, it can start doing meaningful 
work. That power, however, comes 
with a warning: the administration 
was wrong in its actions, but not just 
because it was the administration. 
An autonomous board of students is 
just as capable of disregarding the 
concerns of students for its own 
agenda. I wish the board good luclc, 
but remember: we're all watching 
now.

PUB 
ContInued from page 1 
what we wanted." 

According to Carruthers, the next 
step will be to make minor alter-
ations to the renovation plan at 
tonighl's meeting of the University 
Center Board. 

"Essentially, what we're going 
to do is make the scope of the project 
fit the budget we have," he said. 

One part of the renovation plan 
likely to be reconsidered is the box 
office that was scheduled 10 be added 
to the pub's entrance. 

The cost of the box office is 
roughly the same amount as the 
shortfall between the con truction 
bid and the budget. 

"The only thing they can knock 
out without affecting theotherthings 
i the ticket booth." said Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) Presi-
dent and UCB Representative 
Denise Fenton. In the past,the GSA 
has been critical of the plan to add 
the box office to the pub. 

Fenton added that it was not guar-
anteed that the UCB would have to 
cut anything from the project. and 
that other option , such as alloca-
tion of more fu nds. would be dis-
cus ed. "This is something we 

Jim Carruthers 
haven't talked about yet. I would 
think [Carruthers] would wait until 
the UCB meeting to see if they 
wouldallocatethernoney," hesaid. 

This is the latest in a series of 
budget problems to affect the de-
layed renovation of the pub. C0n-
struction was originally scheduled 
to be completed at the tart of Win-
ter Quarter. 1992 until discrepan-
cies between the available budget 
and the estimated cost forced reno-
vation plans to be allered. 

After pushing the completion of 
the project back toJune. 1992, reno-
vation was delayed again when ini-
tial construction bids were at least 
$40.000 over the allocated budget. 

Construction on the pub is slated 
to begin next month.

NAS 
ContInued from PICe 1 
working on comminces to provide 
scientific evaluations. 

Forexample, he has already been 
involved in NAS projects by travel-
ing to the former Soviet Union and 
Eastem Europe to inspect labs and 
interview scientists for selection as 
participants in a science training 
program in the United States. 

An election to the NAS is a vic-
tory not only for Fung and 
Heinemann. but also for the many 
others who have worked in their 
labs over the years, Heinemann said 

''I'm very pleased and happy that 
my peers have recognized the work 
being done in my laboratory at the 
Salk Institute," Heinemann said in a 
recent interview. 

Heinemann said that after devel-
oping an interest in combining bio-
chemistry and physics with the st udy 
of the brain, he pursued an under-
graduate education at CaITech,then 
worked on his Ph.D. at Harvard. 

Heinemann then completed his 
post-graduate work at the Massa-
chusetts Institute offechnology and 
Stanford University. 

Heinemann encourages students 
intere ted in science to develop a 

specific area of interest outside of 
school before selecting a course of 
study and to pursue a post-graduate 
degree. 

Rather than mechanically work-
ing through the required classes. 
Heinemann advises, "you have to 
be interested in learning the 
courseworit. .. 

Fung has been visiting the Hong 
Kong University of Science and 
Technology, and therefore was un-
available for comment. 

Fung's research in rheology in-
cludes a focus on the mechanics of 
soft tissues in the heart, lungs and 
blood cells. 

Recently, Fung has been work-
ing on describing the entire system 
of blood circulation in the heart, 
including shape, measurement and 
mechanical properties of coronary 
blood vessels. 

One of the questions he is ex-
ploring is how change in blood 
pressure might deform or even de-
stroy the Ii ning of blood vessels. 

Fung, the recipient of numerous 
honors and awards. has also wrinen 
a new book titled Biomechanics -
Motion. Flow. Stress alld Growth, 
the third volume in a series. The first 
two volumes were published in 1981 
and 1984.

ContInued fIom .... 1 
Studies Yen Le Espiritu said, "Im-
migrants and native-bom Ameri -
cam have problems understanding 
one another," noting Los Angeles' 
large Korean and African-Ameri-
can communities. 

After their presentations, the 
members of the panel heard ques-
tions and comments from the audi-
ence. One man asked if the panelists 
were condoning the,violence and 
looting in Los Angeles. . 

Professor of Ethnic Studies 
George Lipsitz. one of the panelists, 
responded by equating the violence 
with the program cuts made by the 
Bush administration, saying he does 
not condone either. 

Later, another audience member 
accused the panelists of blaming 
inner-city social ills on "the white 
bogey-man. " 

1be question which drew the 
most response was from a white 
woman who asked why African-
Americans sometimes discourage 
whites from participating in Afri-
can-American causes by saying, 
"It's a black thing, you wouldn' t 
understand ... 

Among the mixed reactions fol -
lowing this question, Third College 
sophomore Gaye Johnson said Af-
rican-Americans have different ex-
periences and whites' commitment 
to African-American causes are 
sometimes questioned, which may 
lead some African-Americans to 
think that whites do not understand 
African-American issues. 

"Whatlleamed from [the upris-
ings] is that I don't understand. [ 
can't," said another white woman, 
who said she went to Los Angeles to 
aid in the clean-up effort. 

One man in the audience said, H[ 
think white people can help the 
movement by shuning up and lis-
tening to black people for a change. " 

1be event was the fourth of its 
kind held at UCSD. The previous 
three forums addressed issues raised 
by the Tiananrnen Square incident, 
the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
events leading to the Gulf War.

tients, the di ease actually gets 
worse. The person withdraw from 
society, may bI.>come seriously ui-
cidal and have difficulty taking care 
of themselve . 

"Older patients end up perma-
nently in mental hospitals and nurs-
ing homes. TIle majority of the 
people lie between these two ex-
tremes - they continue to have 
symptom , but they wax and wane. 
At times they will have more symp-
toms, and at other times they will 
have fewer symptom ." Jeste said. 

In the past. when older people 
exhibited the symptoms, the diag-
nosisalways wouldbeAIzheimer·s. 
Doctors never considered that it 
might be some form of geriatric 

schizophrenia, according to Je teo 
In Alzheimer's, there is a progre -
ivedeleriomtion in functioning. and 

more than 50 percent of patient die 
within 10 years. There is also a 
defin ite pathology in the bmin,since 
the brain appears gro I y abnormal. 

In schizophrenic patients. how-
ever. the bmin might not look any 
different from a nolTI1al bmin. There 
are change ', albeit not large ones, 
but enough to be the basis of the new 
research. " We're going to make this 
a very comprehensive and multi-
disciplinary study of psycho is in 
late life," Je te said It will include 
complete psychological. neurologi-
cal and medical evaluations of the 
patients. The researchers will al 0

drugs can bedangerous, and if given 
over a long period of time. they can 
produce persistent side effect . 

"It's adouble-whammy, because 
if you stop the drug, the patients will 
continue to worsen: if you adminis-
ter the drug. they will suffer from 
the side-effects. U ·ually. it ' adeci-

make," Jeste added. The co t of 
these drugs, in addition to the over-
all loss of productivity and the need 
for public assistance and hospital-
ization is what makes schizophre-
nia a very expensive disease.

Although the races were 
unscheduled, VaJlerga was pleased 
about his team's ability to compete 
against Long Beach State in prepa-
ration forthe upcoming Pac i fie Coast 
Rowing Olampionships (PeRCs). 
Vallerga was impressed in panicu-
lar with the results of the varsity 4 
event which the Tritons won by 
approximately six and one-halfsec-

boat length lead within the first 20 
seconds of the race and were able to 
build it to one length within 700

by approximately one and one-half 
boat lengths and one boatlength, re-

The Long Beach women's team 
won one additional race that day 
against USD's varsity 8. 

Vallerga seized the Long Beach 
offer to include race again t the 
women's team in addition to the 

scheduled men's regatta because it 
was a "refre hing opportunity" for 
the Triton varsity, which was get-

marily 4s this season. 

Vallergasaid thallhe Long Beach 
athletic program is a very strong 
one, and predicted that long Beach's 
women's crew team will grow con-
sidembly through the direction of 
new Varsity Coach Bill Zack. who 
brings East Coast experience with 
him. 

The men 's crew team also had

The '90s: what a time it was. 
Especially May 1992, when the 
entire sports world seemed to 
coalesce around San Diego. I wa 
finishing up school then. at lhe old 
University of California. That was 
before the genetic accident up on 
Torrey Pine Mesa, before they 
had to nuke La 10lla to get rid of 
the three-headed hedgehog 
people. 

It wa.s a renais ance of San 
Diego sport. led by the America' 
Cup. Believe it or not, the 
America's Cup wasn't the huge 
succe s it is today: back then. San 
Diego merchants complained 
repeatedly that the cup didn't 
bring enough money into the local 
economy. 

N ow. OF COU RSE. the America's Cup brings 
millions of credits into a commu-

cared if the American boat beal 
the boat from Italy. Yes. this was 
long before the Italians started to 
dominate the world'~ sporting 
community. Even before bocce 
replaced ba. ketball as planet 
Earth's sporting obsession. 

Basketball was becoming the 
international spon back then. led 
by the great Michael Jordan -
yes. the same one we now talk 
about in the arne breath as the 
other "best players of all time: " 
hockey's Wayne Grelzky, who 
was winding up his career in '92, 
and baseball's Billy Swift. who in 
'92 began pitching like the man

Since the university does not even

certain percentage of accepted students will never

BlU.COLES 
Admissions Committee Chair 

The number of applicants wasn't always this 
high. But in Fall 1986, the UC changed its applica-
tion form so it could be used to apply to every UC 
campus. Students applying to UC campuses only 
had to fill out one application, and could then check 
boxes to note to which campuses they wanted to 
apply. 

current 
Admissions Committee Chair and ECE Professor 
Bill Coles, "and admi ions is a relatively minor 
part of that. I don't expect it to become very 
controversial." 

For the top 60 percent of all students admitted to 
UCSD, ethnicity is not a factor at all. When a 
student applies to this campus, the registrar's office 
compiles a ranked list of applicants based on a point 
system. 

First, each student receives 1,000 points multi-

equal pan of the selection formula? 
"The problem is that high schools vary, and 

grading standards differ," Coles says_ "Using the 
SAT and Achievement tests add uniformity - we 
have to put some weight on exam scores." 

According to Bowker, the first year of the new 
system marked quite a change from previous years' 
admission procedures. 

"Nationwide, about 60 percent of [accepted 
students) register," Bowker says. "Here, I expect 23 
or 24 percent to register." 

The reason why such a small number of students 
accepted to UCSD actually come. Bowker says, is 
probably tied to the post-I 986 UC application fonn . 
Now that students can check other boxes on the 
application form, more students whose first choices 
are UCLA or UC Berkeley may now check the 
UCSD box a~ a "back-up" school. 

After the pure numbers of the first selection 
index are used, UCSD has finished filling 60 
percent of its incoming freshman class. Only then 
are the specifics on application forms reviewed by 
six professional evaluators from the UCSD 

"The first year, nobody had any idea how many 
students to admit," he says. 

Bowker has a fixed number of incoming 
freshmen he can admit every year, in addition to a "We don't know if we're their first choice or

not," Bowker S(IYS. "but we have 10 assume thm we 
are. " 

In the end, it all comes down to Bowker. who has 
been working in UCSD admiss ions for almost 25 
years, playing a guessing game in tJeciding how 
many students 10 admit. 

"When we ~end out our acceptances on March 
IS, all 11.000 students we've admilled are there. If 
all of them accept . we have to take them," he ~ays. 
and shudders. "When the acceptances start coming 
in .. . one day I'll think I accepted too many. Ihe next 
day not enough." In the end. he usually manage~ 10 
get the total within 25 students or so on either side. 

Unique on the UC application form is UCSD\ 
request for applicants to mnk colleges in their order 
of preference. After a student has been accepted, 
Bowker and his team must also place them in 
different colleges. Every college has a limit to the 
number of students they wish to accept . a number 
determined by agreement of all the college provosts. 

According to Bowker. just about every student in 
the top 60 percent is accepted to their fir.;t -choice 
college. But due to the large number of students who 
choose Muir College <l~ their first choice. many 
students in the next 40 percent are shunted to a 
different college instead, usually their second or 
thi rd choice. 

Last week the acceptances for Fall Quarter 1992 
finished rolling in, and Ihe job of finding qualified 
studenls to attend UCSD has been successful for 
another year. The fact Ihal these applicants are 
qualified 10 be UC students is, according to those 
involved with the selection process, the most 
important thing. 

"What we're really interested in is not bringing in 
people who will drop out," Coles says. 

"We only admit students who have a reasonable 
chance at success," Bond says. 

With an avemge high school GPA of 4.02 and 
aver.lge SAT scores of 575 Verbal and 667 Math, 
next year's freshmen seem 10 til th:1I category as 
well as anyone might hop.:. 

And with new freshmen for Fall Quaner 1992 
accepted, the process stalls all over again. At the end

the potential UCSD class of 1997 - will be due.

War and Remembrance 
Students memorialize those murdered in the Holocaust 

ESSAY BY ALICIA BE ll , CON TR IBUTING WRITER 

A commemoration of the Holocaust took place with a 
reading of victims' names and a memorial service on 
Wednesday, April 29 and Thursday, April 30. 

At 8 a.m., members of the United Jewish Appeal 
(UJA), one section of UCSO' Union of Jewish Students, 
began reading the names of 19,000 victims listed in a 
booklet from various concentration camps. When I first 
opened the booklet, I was trongly shocked to see 0 many 
page of people, sometime Ii ted by whole families or 
profe ion. 

I felt even sicker when Revelle College sophomore 
Karen Watts began reading the name . It finally made the 
number six million 
seem a little more 

" 

Ophira Bergman told me the story of her Gennan grandfa-
ther who was placed in a concentration camp, but was able 
to get out because he had perfonned an abortion for the 
mistress of the camp director. 

Several people came up to u to tell u that we were 
making an impact on them or to ask us questions about the 
Holocau I. Why did one of our posters mention 14 million 
killed? How did they pick this date for Yom Ha-Shoah 
(Holocau t Remembrance Day)? 

The number 14 million is the total number of "undesir-
able" people that the Nazi exterminated, including Jews, 
homosexuals, Gypsie and all the others.

in Gennan). By 1941, the Nazi had ordered all Jews age 
ix and Ider to wear su h a star on their shirts at aJltimes. 

This badge enabled people in anti-semitic c untrie to 
immediately identify Jews and prevent them from getting 
food and other goods. In Poland, the Nazi made ure that 
Jews who did not wear the Mar on the back and front f 
their clothing would be killed. 

I wore a tar not only at the re:Jding • but to my c1a<>se 
that day, and I got a few strange looks. It definitely ingled 
me out. I imagined that the Jew who had to wear this 
pecial badge must have felt i olated and uncomfortable as 

well.

helped organize the event, said to me. "Look at all of the

Holocau t. combined with Jewish prayers. A map of 
the concentration camp Treblinka was included in 
the packet distributed at the service. The service 
ended with the readill8 of a moving tatement by 
Jewish author Elie Wiesel about a need for 
hope and for repairing the world. 

Later that day, a representative from 
Amnesty International briefly spoke 
with a imilar focu . He talked about 
the Rodney King incident and Lo 
Angele riots, and tre, sed how impor- ~~~~!:!!!!e;~ 
tant it is to end the violence and the lack of 
communication between people. 

"The Holocau t didn't just happen; it built 
up slowly. First there were quotas for 
Jews at Gennan schools, then 
curfew ,and so on. The 
message here is that any 
dimini hrnent of personal 
freedom makes the other 

steps easier to make. For Hitler, the 
final tep was the murdering of 
the Jews. If you want to 
prevent future holo-
causts, be careful of 
the first teps. The 
unthinkable 
can happen. 
The Jews 
are living 
proof of that, 
said Rabbi 
Sheldon Moss.
