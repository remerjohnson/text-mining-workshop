UCSD admitted the largest number 
of new international students ever this 
fall. The tuition an international student 
helps offset the recent state budget cuts.

Freshmen international students 
at UCSD have increased by 250 per-
cent. Last year, only 100 freshmen 
were admitted — this year 350 were.

UCSD welcomed 1,300 new interna-
tional students this year. Only 1,000 new 
students were admitted in 2010. The total 
number of undergraduate and graduate 
international students this year is 3,212 
compared to last year’s 2,333 students.

“We didn’t think it would go 
up quite that high this year, but we 
weren’t surprised in the final analy-
sis that it did,” Dean of International 
Education Lynn C. Anderson said.

Anderson said that given the budget 
cuts from state funding, the out-of-state 
tuition paid by international students 
helps the campus budget tremendously.

“Out-of-state students, whether 
they are residents of Minnesota, New 
York or China, pay out of state tuition 
and so they’re paying an additional 
$35,000 per year beyond what California 
residents would pay,” Anderson said. 

This past year, approximately $35 mil-
lion came from out-of-state tuition, $15 
million of which accounted for the under-
graduate enrollments. Another $35 million 
went to on- and off-campus housing, meals, 
services, gasoline, and entertainment.

Anderson said that UCSD’s 2012 
rank as 8th best university in the coun-
try by U.S. News & World and 33rd  in 
the world by Times Higher Education 
and Thomson Reuters, is a reason for 
the surge in international students.

“UC San Diego is highly regarded inter-
nationally and UC San Diego’s reputation 
as a world-class university continues to 
grow, so the large numbers of interna-
tional students seeking admission is not 
surprising,” Anderson said in an email.

UCSD is not the only school with a larger 
population in international students this year. 
Anderson said other universities across the 
country are experiencing increases as well. 

“I think that the U.S. and the Study 
in the States website is a good indica-
tion of how much better a job the 
United States is doing of talking about 
their higher educational programs for 
international students,” Anderson said.

CHANGES TO UC SAN DIEGO 
BRANDING UNDERWAY

By Laira Martin
News Editor 

UCSD’s department of university commu-nications and public affairs has begun a soft launch to re-brand and market the 
university. Visible changes include a new logo, 
color scheme, motto and most notably a name 
transition from “UCSD” to “UC San Diego.”

“The strategy we used was to leverage 
the momentum generated during the 50th 
Anniversary — including goodwill, exposure 
and outreach — with messaging that will reso-

nate with all audiences, develop a well-defined 
branding and marketing strategy rooted in 
stakeholder research that is still relevant and 
useful, isolate the institutional factors that differ-
entiate UC San Diego from other campuses, and 

create a strategy for competitive 
positioning,” Executive Director 
of University Communications 
and Public Affairs Jeffrey P. Gattas 
said in an email.

Based on market research done 
in 2007, the re-branding efforts 
are meant to make the university 

stand out from other UCs with similar acro-
nyms such as UCSB and local universities such 
as USD and SDSU. 

“With no new funding and using existing 
staff resources, University Communications and 
Public Affairs revisited the market research the 

campus conducted in 2007,” Gattas said. 
Gattas emphasized that university factions 

are not forced to adopt the changes but are 
encouraged to take this push for re-branding as 
an opportunity to achieve the goals of individual 
university factions. The Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, the School of Medicine and 
media relations are a few factions of the uni-
versity that have already agreed to adopt the 
re-branding methods. 

“Since we have no new resources, we have 
been meeting with, and will continue to meet 
with, various campus constituencies over the 
next year encouraging them to embrace the 
brand and use the messaging developed from 
sound research to help meet their individual 
goals,” Gattas said.  “It is our belief that this will 

Rebranding efforts including 
new logo and color scheme are 
now visibile on campus.

MayÊBeÊWhyÊTheyÕreÊProvenÊFunnierÊThanÊWomen
By Regina Ip
Senior Staff Writer

UCSD psychology researchers confirmed the gender ste-reotype that men are funnier 
than women, but not by much. The 
researchers suspect the small differ-
ence is that men try harder and more 
often to be funny than women do.

“All my life, I’ve heard that men 
are funnier,” postdoctoral research-
er Laura Mickes said. “And I never 
believed this, I always thought that we 
were equally funny. The stereotype 
just didn’t make sense to me. It didn’t 
matter much, it’s a little annoying.”

Student ratings for a course 
Mickes taught then prompted her to 
research whether men and women 
were equally capable of producing 
humor, a hypothesis that has never 
been tested before.

“I got a rating on a course I taught 
and one of the students said ‘She’s not 
funny,’” Mickes said. “I thought, first 

of all, ‘How odd, I’m not a comedian,’ 
but second, none of my male counter-
parts got that criticism.”

The study used a controlled ver-
sion of The New Yorker cartoon cap-
tion contest to explore gender stereo-
types of humor.

In the first experiment, research-
ers asked 32 undergraduates — 16 
males and 16 females — to write cap-
tions for 20 cartoons in 45 minutes.

They used the cartoons to elimi-
nate bias because of their gender 
neutrality and because college-aged 
students rarely read The New Yorker.

A separate group of 34 male and 
47 female undergraduates then rated 
captions for each cartoon on a scale 
of 1 to 5. Results found that males 
scored 0.11 more points than women.

“I thought, ‘Holy cow, men are 
funnier,’” Mickes said. “I was horri-
fied and the males on the paper were 
delighted. But the thing is, the differ-
ence was barely detectable.”

In addition, researchers found it 

interesting that men gave higher rat-
ings than women.

In a second experiment, research-
ers tested whether there was bias in 
the caption ratings from the previous 
experiment — specifically if male 
caption writers were rated higher 
than they really were by both female 
and male raters. Participants remem-
bered funny captions and their 
authors better than unfunny captions 
and authors.

In addition, 90 percent of partici-
pants assumed that authors of funny 
captions were male.  Also, male cap-
tion writers predicted a higher per-
formance score for themselves than 
women.

“There’s a shred of truth to this 
stereotype, but the other neat find-
ing is that there is a memory bias,” 
Mickes said. “People tend to misat-
tribute funny things having come 
from a man and not from a woman.”

Researchers observed that men 
used profanity and sexual humor 2 

percent more than women, but did 
not attribute it to their higher ratings.

The researchers, which includ-
ed The New Yorker cartoon editor 
Robert Mankoff, theorized that men 
try harder and more often to be 
funny.

As an example, Mickes said males 
submit more entries for the cartoon 
contest than women do.

“So many more males write in for 
the caption contest than women do,” 
Mickes said. “A lot of women win 
it, even though much fewer submit 
entries.”

In their next step, researchers will 
conduct follow-up experiments to 
measure why men have the humor 
advantage. They will ask participants 
to not be outright funny with mate-
rial that can easily produce humor. 
If males are funnier than females, it 
indicates that males are trying harder.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

Anderson said there is a plan to 
increase international students over 
the next four or five years before 
reaching a stable number. She said 
having international students on cam-
pus exposes undergraduate students 
to different cultures, different ways of 
thinking and different backgrounds.

To apply to a UC, freshman inter-
national students must have com-
pleted their secondary education and 
have earned a certificate of comple-
tion that would allow them to attend 
a university in their home country. 
They also must submit scores from 
the ACT with writing or the SAT 

Reasoning Test. Transfer internation-
al students must have completed at 
least 60 semester units of university 
credit to apply. Both freshman and 
transfer students need to demon-
strate their mastery of English if it 
is not their native language through 
either the Test of English as a Foreign 
Language or the International 
English Language Testing System.

International students do have 
difficulties adjusting to a differ-
ent country and culture, accord-
ing to Anderson. The education 
style, social interactions and com-
munity expectations are different 
from what most international stu-
dents are used to and problems can 

occur because of these differences.
“Just as our UC San Diego stu-

dents studying abroad bring new 
challenges to the campuses on which 
they are enrolled, international stu-
dents at UC San Diego may cause 
challenges for those of us not used 
to interacting with people from 
another country,” Anderson said.

Anderson said international stu-
dents do not displace California resi-
dents. The state funds a certain num-
ber of spots for California residents. 
The spots taken by international stu-
dents would otherwise be unused.

Last night, A.S. Council listened 
attentively to three special presenta-
tions that seemed to get progressively 
longer.

The Transportation Policy 
Committee Undergraduate Student 
Representative Adam Powers 
approached the 
council. Powers 
u n d e r s t a n d s 
the frustrations 
cyclists face here 
at UCSD.

“We don’t 
really have much 
infrastructure for 
bicycling on campus,” he said. “We will 
hopefully see something in the way 
of bike lanes instead of the random 
dismount zones they have right now.”

However, UCSD Transportation 
Services is still operating in a deficit in 
the millions of dollars.

“Funding comes from parking per-
mits and parking citations, which I’m 
sure many of you are familiar with,” he 
said. He knows us all so well.

There are two potential options 
outlined for Transportation Services 
right now. One is to have a blanket 
increase in student fees to pay for the 
shuttles and buses we all know, love 
and use on a daily basis. The other 
is to eliminate free MTS bus use for 
students.

“A referendum would cause a 
steady, solid income, while I can fore-
see less dependability on the user fee,” 
Powers said, leaving an ominous air 
in the Price Center Forum. “Is trans-
portation the kind of thing we put on 
the same level as, let’s say, health care 
on the national level? Is it a natural 
right?”

Then, we finally started the fun 
stuff.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji was overly excited about 

receiving a shipment of postcards. 
These are to be signed and sent to 
Sacramento in protest of our increase 
in tuition and student fees. In fact, Naji 
was so excited he forgot to give the rest 
of his report.

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs 
Mac Zilber 
announced plans 
for the upcoming 
CLICS Lecture 
Hall to include 
standing class-
room workspac-
es.

“The amount of time we spend 
sitting is increasing our mortality 
rate,” he said. Maybe he should initiate 
standing A.S. council meetings: This 
would ensure that our leaders remain 
healthy and strong for the students 
they represent.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing was 
happy to announce what a success the 
A.S. Council retreat was last week-
end. Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick got snaps and 
applause from all of council. I’m sure 
she felt honored, but she had no idea 
what was to come.

After she announced this week’s 
glittery sash winner Social Sciences 
Senator Alex Choi, a well-deserved 
award for the guy who “puts the ‘social’ 
in ‘social sciences,’” Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Kevin Hoang 
announced that Madnick was also this 
week’s Council Member of the Week. 
Instead of a blue sash, she got a sparkly 
foam crown with her name on it.

“In her spare time, she enjoys 
advocating student life on campus,” 
Hoang announced.

Both of the honored Council 
Members of the Week had to strut 
their stuff to Maroon 5’s “Moves Like 
Jagger.”

be more of an organic change rather 
than something sudden and instant.”

Although the market research 
was done four years prior, Gattas still 
feels the findings are relevant. Gattas 
says over 3,600 prospective students, 
faculty, current students, staff, alum-
ni and other university constituents 
were consulted via qualitative and 
quantitative methodologies with half 
of those surveyed made up solely of 
current and prospective students. 

“In addition we consulted with 
stakeholders from faculty, staff, stu-
dents and other campus constitu-
ents about the research data and its 
outcomes.   We concluded that after 
a fresh look the data was still very 
relevant today,” he said. 

The re-branding was launched 
this academic year since last year was 
UCSD’s 50th anniversary. 

“We needed to replace the ener-
gy and excitement created by this 
milestone anniversary with a fresh 
approach to branding and market-
ing going forward into our next 50 

years,” Gattas said. 
The new logo — which is based 

on the UCSD Medical Center’s 
current logo —  comes in three set 
color schemes. The name change 
has already been seen in the 
revamped “This Week at UC San 
Diego,” a weekly e-newsletter sent 
by the Department of University 
Communications and Public Affairs 
to university constituents.  

“As part of this fresh look, we 
felt it was time to update the logo of 
the university,” Gattas said.   “Again 
based on market trends and best 
practices a new, more refined look 
was developed to incorporate the 
strength of the university name — 
UC San Diego — and complement 
the branding used by the health sys-
tem to integrate the full potential of 
our campus.”

Additionally the university’s 
motto has changed from “Local 
Impact, National Influence, Global 
Reach” to “Learn it. Live it.”

“This theme is not part of the logo 
but rather allows campus constituen-
cies to use it in communicating what 

the research tells us in uniquely UC 
San Diego,” Gattas said. “That our 
students and faculty believe innova-
tion is central to who we are and 
what we do. Here, you learn that 
knowledge isn’t just acquired in the 
classroom — life is your laboratory.”

New advertisements that use the 
“Learn it. Live it.” motto will also cap-
italize on the San Diegan lifestyle and 
how that plays into UCSD’s appeal 
to prospective students. Examples of 
advertisements incorporate both the 
academic and southern Californian 
aspects of the UCSD lifestyle. 

According to Gattas, students 
should begin to notice visible brand-
ing and marketing changes on cam-
pus within the next year or so.

“We believe students, faculty and 
staff will start to see these changes on 
various types of collateral materials, 
news articles, web pages, etc. over 
the next year or so as various depart-
ments, organizations or divisions 
begin to adopt the changes,” he said.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Dear Editor,
A disheartening yet recurring 

theme I’ve encountered through-
out my time at UCSD has been 
one of overwhelming student 
apathy. 

If I were to conduct a research 
poll on Library Walk tomorrow, 
I could safely wager my last year 
of tuition (which is increasing by 
upwards of 16 percent next year 
– easy money!) that the majority 
of UCSD undergraduates could 
not explain what effect AB-131 or 
SB-185 would have on California 
higher education. 

I would double-down that at 
least a quarter of them wouldn’t 
have a clue what ABs and SBs are, 
let alone what the difference is 
between them. 

Even more frightening, UCSD 
students seem to be in over-
whelming support of closing 
our libraries and increasing our 
class sizes as well as our tuition. 
(Oops... I mean student fees. 

Sorry, Reagan.) They also appear 
to be staunchly against any and 
all efforts to increase funding 
for California’s public education 
system. 

Ridiculous you say, editor? 
Well, frankly, this is how politi-
cians quantify the opinions of the 
vast majority of UCSD students. 

In 2010, only 6 percent of 
UCSD students were registered to 
vote in San Diego County. Let me 
rephrase that: For every group of 
100 UCSD students, only six of 
them were “deemed fit” to voice 
the concerns of the other 94. 

This figure is absolutely appall-
ing, but explains exactly why the 
minority of students who are 
registered to vote is so incredibly 
frustrated.

 Should we expect hope, 
change and an affordable educa-
tion to simply fall into our laps at 
the drop of a hat? Are we so naïve 
to think that politicians will take 
our interests to Congress if they 

hear that we staged a half-hearted 
protest outside Center Hall? To 
answer, I’d like to quote a student 
activist who I admire: “Politicians 
speak only one language: votes.” 

If the UCSD student body, 
faculty and staff are committed 
to seeing the change they so very 
much desire in our community, 
there is a quick and easy solution: 
registering to vote. 

The form itself takes literally 
two minutes to fill out, and there 
are resources available on campus 
to those who require any kind of 
assistance in filling out the form 
(Here’s one: www.sopaucsd.word-
press.com)

Of course, when Election Day 
comes around, our community 
needs to also exercise our new-
found right to vote, and carefully 
no less. An uninformed voter 
is far worse than an informed 
abstainer, and it is positively cru-
cial that we understand the sig-
nificance of a vote for or against 

a particular candidate or proposi-
tion. 

When all of our voices have 
been put to a ballot, we become 
a force to be reckoned with, and 
then you can wager your own 
tuition that politicians will take 
notice.

 I can assure you… it’s a safe 
bet.

A Shiny New Label
UCSD’s new branding intiative may play to the campus’ strengths, but it is 

doubtful whether these changes will fix its reputation.

EDITORIAL

I hate San Diego roads — I really do. I can hardly read a book on the bus or keep a cup of coffee 
from spilling while traveling over the 
endless potholes lining the city. 

Earlier this month, a gigantic 
sinkhole the size of Mt. Doom 
opened up on Campus Point Drive. 
City officials estimate the total cost 

for fixing all public infrastructure 
including streets, storm drains and 
buildings will be $840 million.

TRIP, a national transportation 
research group, ranks San Diego as 
the No. 8 city with the worst roads 
among big cities. They estimated that 
drivers spend an extra $654 a year 
to operate their vehicles because of 
the poorly maintained roads. Three 
other California cities make the top 
five: San Francisco, Los Angeles and 
San Jose.

The principal blame for San 
Diego’s languishing roads lies with 
the bureaucracy. There is no assess-
ment of which projects need repair: 
City council approval can take 
months to assess them, even longer 
to award repair contracts and take 
the time it takes for actual repairs. 
Also, the pension crisis in the last 
decade hit the city budget hard, leav-
ing roads in disrepair. Obviously, 
short-term thinking has come back 
to haunt us.

That’s not to say politicians 
haven’t been trying to fix this prob-
lem. Committees have been formed 
to perform assessment of projects 
that need repair, attempts have been 
made to reduce red tape and the city 
has spent 6 1/2 more on road repairs 
than under the previous mayoral 
administration. 

It has become an important issue 
in the 2012 mayoral election as well. 
Candidates like Councilman Carl 
DeMaio and Assemblyman Nathan 
Fletcher have released plans on infra-
structure improvement. 

At their own peril, District 
Attorney Bonnie Dumanis and 
Congressman Bob Filner have not 
released any specifics on how they 
would solve San Diego’s pothole 
problem. 

DeMaio’s plan is superior to 
Fletcher’s which includes platitudes 
like “creating a culture of account-
ability” and “streamlining the pro-
cess.” 

Although DeMaio’s proposals 
are specific, they are not necessarily 
realistic. 

Part of it includes a ballot referen-
dum asking the voters to lock in all 
spending growth into infrastructure 
improvements, which will be a dif-
ficult hurdle for DeMaio.

I don’t know about you, but roads 
need to be a top priority for San 
Diego’s political class. 

If I can’t fill up my McDonald’s 
extra-large cup to the brim and drive, 
then I don’t even know what it means 
to be an American anymore. 

Repair assessments need to be 
made, funding must be found for 
them and red tape needs to be cut, 
gosh darnit!

UCSD’s “socially dead” reputa-tion may well be over. The university communications 
and public affairs office wants to 
rebrand UCSD as a research facility by 
the sea. To do so, it plans on chang-
ing all references of UCSD to UC San 
Diego and heavily play up the school’s 
location in a series of advertisements 
to draw in potential students. It’s 
not a half-bad idea. After all, UCSD 
(sorry, UC San Diego) is scornfully 
looked upon as a low-quality UCLA 
or Cal knock-off and prime research 
facility — and that’s it. We are an 
academic school, first and foremost, 
a moniker that has begun to seriously 
harm our reputation. It’s high time to 
make a change, to draw students in 
with promises of rockin’ beach parties, 
babes sunning on Black’s Beach and 
gnarly waves. That way, UCSD won’t 
be seen as the school that people go to 
when their other prospects are grim. 

The office decided to take on these 

big changes, partly as a result of the 
natural ebb of attention after last year’s 
UCSD’s 50th Anniversary celebrations. 
Without sufficient funds to conduct a 
new market research study, the office 
drew upon a 2007 market research 
study that surveyed 3,600 community 
members, a third of whom were pro-
spective students. 

According to the study, UCSD 
is often confused with neighboring 
schools like SDSU and USD, hence 
the proposed emphasis on “UC San 
Diego.” The name change is accom-
panied by a new, minimalist logo sans 
Geisel Library, and the theme, “Live 
it, Learn it.” The theme, intended to 
highlight UCSD’s prowess as both an 
academic institution and a community 
service school, is a rather refreshing 
change from the stodgy old “Local 
Impact, National Influence, Global 
Reach.” One such ad features the

tagline “From the whiteboard to the 
surfboard” and a chipper student car-
rying a calculus-scrawled surfboard. 
As cheesy as it might seem, the ad 
makes a good point. Our students 
boast lives far outside of the class-
room.

These elements, according to the 
office, are merely suggestions for dif-
ferent university departments. These 
are changes that they should make 
— the more departments that take 
part, the more effective the campaign 
will be. But at this point, changes are 
unlikely to be made. 

More uncertain though, is wheth-
er the redesign would impact the 
decisions of prospective students. The 
communications office has clearly put 
in a great deal of effort in its quest to 
change UCSD’s reputation. But this 
push to rebrand seems like something 
better suited as a university-wide 
initiative, like the 50th anniversary 
celebration. That way students, pro-
spective or otherwise, would be 
actively able to see the changes and 
take notice. 

The office especially hit home 
with one aspect of UCSD that has 
been continually cast aside in favor of 
academic boasting — our location. 

Of course, UCSD is a top-notch 
school academically — and with 

good reason. It’s currently ranked 
eighth best in the nation by U.S. 
News & World Report, 33rd in the 
world by Times Higher Education 
and boasts eight Nobel Laureates, 
eight MacArthur Fellows and three 
National Medal of Science recipients. 
We are pretty evenly matched, aca-
demically, against UC powerhouses 
like UCLA and Cal. And though 
academics alone may not be enough 
to strike the fancy of prospective 
students — Division I athletics and a 
football team couldn’t hurt, for start-
ers — maybe this will change the 
tepid campus culture as well. 

We have the cliffs, we have Black’s 
and we have our proximity to down-
town San Diego and Los Angeles. 
LA may have its smog and sass and 
Berkeley may have Telegraph — but 
we have the surf and everything that 
goes with it. It’s a good thing they’re 
playing it up — we have a lot more to 
be proud of than a library designed 
like a prison watchtower, even if 
students spend more time in the said 
library than the beaches.  

The communication office’s 
rebranding initiative has good inten-
tions, but after a while, it is disheart-
ening to see UCSD’s reputation as 
not-UCLA. Perhaps this will be the 
change that transforms UCSD, but 
given the evidence of general uncon-
cern and apathy — probably not.

ReadyÊforÊ
theÊZombie-
ocalypse?
Disclaimer: I read a lot of zombie literature. The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z sit on my 
bedside table, and Ive already planned 
out my survival strategy in the event of 

an undead apocalypse. I dont know if I 
should share the finer details, but it may 
or may not involve requisitioning Geisel 
Library and burning down the first few 
flights of stairs. And crossbows. Lots of 
crossbows. 

So when AMC began airing the 
Walking Dead television series 
(based on the fantastic but markedly 
different comic book) last year, I was 
understandably jazzed. Finally, a show 
that takes a burgeoning horror motif  
vampires can go put a stake in it  and 
manages to craft a poignant statement 
about human nature. 

And thats what sets Walking Dead 
aside from thriller-dramas like 28 Days 
Later or horror-comedies like Dawn 
of the Dead. It is, at its core, not about 
zombies at all. Its about humans try-
ing their best to survive  or decide 
whether living is worth it  in a world 
where civilization is quickly collapsing 
around them.

In a surprisingly philosophical way, 
Walking Dead examines how an 
apocalyptic world brings out the best 
and worst in humanity. 

The best: A caring father-son duo 
take in and shelter Rick, the protago-
nist, who returns the favor by leaving 
them with half the sheriff s armory. 
The question of why the armory wasnt 
cleared out before was never addressed, 
but I digress.

And the worst: adultery, suicide and 
racism. Each character is forced to con-
front his or her own personal demons 
in a tight-knit community in which 
each member must ultimately rely on 
the others to survive. Case in point: 
Ricks cop-buddy Shane, believing Rick 
to be dead, slept with his wife until Rick 
strolled back into camp. How awkward. 

Darker questions regarding human 
morality are abounding. What should 
be placed first: morality or survival? 
And what is the point of surviving like 
an animal when you lose every sense of 
what it means to be human? Deep ques-
tions indeed. 

Its slow pace and seemingly random 
monologues may turn off many viewers 
 a character literally waxes poetic for 
several minutes about the importance 
of keeping time  but in the end, the 
intended point is made. There is no way 
in hell we can survive a zombie apoca-
lypse. Its just not possible. Zombies 
appear out of nowhere, disrupting a 
nice family campfire and chewing the 
abusive father alive until he is no more 
than a half-gnawed rib cage. 

Actually, part of the fun is guessing 
who is going to die next. My money is 
on Sophia, the little girl, walking up to 
camp as a freshly reanimated zombie. 
Zombies are not kind to children. Not 
even blonde ones.

Now in its second season, the show 
has certainly hit its stride. Each episode, 
in traditional Walking Dead fashion, 
comes replete with a fantastic, disgust-
ing ew sequence while keeping the 
show from regressing into a shotgun 
free-for-all. And still, for our survivors, 
hope is not on the horizon. I guess its 
time to burn down the stairs.

ELIZABETH OLSEN TRUMPS 
CHILD STAR PRESUMPTIONS.  

By ren eBel • hiatus editor

Growing up, Elizabeth Olsen had a strange relationship with celeb-rity life. Three years 
younger than wonder twins 
Mary-Kate and Ashley, Olsen 
was toted to after-school movie 
shoots and weekend rehearsals, 
even landing a few cameo spots 
in the duos countless kiddie 
productions. Dodging paparazzi 
was daily routine  and it was 
frightening. 

Even now, following her 
breakthrough performance in 
Sean Durkins riveting psycholog-
ical thriller Martha Marcy May 
Marlene (one of three roles this 
year and the first since her 1996 
appearance in The Adventures 
of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case 
of the U.S. Space Camp Mission), 
the 22-year-old actress is uncom-
fortable in the limelight.

I have a hard time, Olsen 
told the Guardian in a conference 
call. Im in every frame of the 
movie, and so that was difficult 
to watch. I dont necessarily enjoy 
watching myself for that long.

But after the films lucra-
tive Sundance premier and 
subsequent wave of Oscar buzz 
for Olsens staggering portrayal 
of Martha  a disillusioned 
ex-member of an abusive back-
to-nature cult  Olsens sudden 
arrival is difficult to ignore. 

And its Olsens eerily subtle 
delivery  mirrored by a truly 
haunting John Hawkes as emaci-
ated cult leader Patrick  that 
makes Martha Marcy May 
Marlene such a frightening 
experience. Olsen attributes this 
to writer/director Sean Durkins 
on-set dynamic.

The great thing about Sean as 
a director is he presents himself as

an open book,” Olsen said. “We also created such 
a tight-knit family, it was a small crew, it was a 
small cast, and we all lived together on location. 
And so all of that created an amazing creative 
environment.”

Kate Winslet’s performance in the similarly 
cult-themed 1999 drama “Holy Smoke!” also 
influenced Olsen’s transformation. 

“It gave me an understanding of how nudity 
could be used in a way for it to tell a story, as 
opposed to being gratuitous or sensationalized,” 
Olsen said. “[Winslet’s] performance in that is off 
the wall, so I was very happy to have seen that 
before working...it just gave me a sort of confi-
dence. But I didn’t base Martha off anyone real, 
whether that was in my life or in fiction.”

Deterred by the media’s omnipresence in the 
lives of her older sisters, Olsen focused on her 
education at an early age, honing her craft at the 
legendary Atlantic Theater Company in New 
York City. But the transition from theater to film 
acting required some ingenuity. 

“It’s very analytically based, and for me that’s 

the most effective way to work,” Olsen said. 
“Especially on a script that’s so riddled [with] 
puzzles. The only way that I can approach act-
ing this is really making everything as specific as 
possible from an analytic point of view. [It’s] not 
really what they highlight at the Atlantic.”

In one scene, Martha discovers that she’s been 
tailed by a cult member, launching her into an 
on-screen psychological breakdown for the ages. 
It’s Olsen’s first display of unhinged emotion, and 
the result is as unnerving as it is believable. 

“There’s only one cut in that whole scene,” 
Olsen said. “And I just remember it so well — 
trying to find out the rhythm of that scene and 
how to build a climax without any cuts. That was 
a really rough day.”

But Olsen is drawn to the challenge. Her 
next film, “Silent House,” is an indie-horror flick 
shot in one continuous 78-minute take. It’s a 
career move as daring as “Martha Marcy May 
Marlene”’s cliffhanger ending, and a thrilling start 
for this year’s unlikely breakthrough actress.

“Martha Marcy May Marlene” is now playing 
in theaters. “Silent House” is scheduled for release 
on March 9, 2012.

and she dropped it back to senior defender Sara 
Spaventa. Spaventa took a shot that deflected off the 
crossbar. The ball bounced down and between the 
Sonoma goalkeeper and senior forward Courtney 
Capobianco.

Capobianco, who hasn’t recorded a start this 
season but whose four goals marks her as the team’s 
third-highest goal scorer, effortlessly headed the ball 
into the back of the net — but not before she collided 
with the goalkeeper.

“[The ball] hit the crossbar and my defender kept 
me onside, so I crashed the box and beat the keeper’s 
punch on the bounce and headed it in,” Capobianco 
said.

With the win, the Tritons improve to 11-1-4 over-
all and 10-1-3 in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. UCSD also secured a spot in the confer-
ence tournament, sitting a solid six points ahead of 
No. 2 CSU Los Angeles. But in the North division, 
the race is tightening up: with just two regular season 
matches left to play, Chico State and Sonoma are bat-
tling for the top spot with 26 points apiece and CSU 
Stanislaus trailing not far behind.

“[Coach McManus] always talks about peaking at 
the right part of the season,” Armstrong said. “With 
the wins this weekend, I think we’re right in track 
with where we want to be. But we certainly haven’t 
peaked yet.”

On Friday, the Tritons faced bottom of the league 

Humboldt State, which has a miserable 1-11-2 con-
ference record. 

After UCSD managed to score only one goal in 
their past three games, there were concerns that the 
Tritons were struggling in the attack.

But senior midfielder Shelby Wong laid any wor-
ries to rest, knocking the ball in the net just thirteen 
minutes into the match. Wong doubled the lead just 
three minutes later.

The Tritons extended their lead in the second 
half, when McTigue dribbled down to the corner and 
found Wong on the cross. Wong finished the ball past 
the Humboldt keeper to finish off the hat trick.

Junior transfer Taryn Bales and junior midfielder 
Alexa Enlow would tack on two more before the end 
of the game to beat the Lumberjacks 5-0.

“Right now we’re just looking to take these two 
games this weekend,” Armstrong said. “And we’re just 
looking to build up towards the postseason.”

The Tritons are the first of four teams to punch 
their tickets to the CCAA Championships, scheduled 
for Nov. 4-6, to be hosted by CSU Stanislaus.

UCSD will round off their regular season with 
two more games at home this weekend. On Friday, 
Oct. 28, the Tritons will host San Francisco State at 
7 p.m. On Sunday, UCSD will celebrate their nine 
graduating seniors before their game against Cal Poly 
Pomona at 2:30 p.m.

ble past the keeper to score the golden goal. 
       “Sonoma is one of the toughest teams in the 
league, so it meant a lot to beat them in front 
of our fans,” Walker said. “I’ve never scored a 
golden goal before, so to do it against Sonoma 
with four minutes left in the game was amazing.” 
    UCSD won another close game on Friday, when the 
Tritons faced bottom of the league Humboldt State. 
       Overcoming a 2-1 deficit after the first 
half, the Tritons scored two goals in 
the second period to take the 3-2 lead. 
       “I think that it just instills a little bit of belief 
back in the team,” Pascale said. “After a few tough 
results, I think it was natural to start having a 
couple doubts. But we just try and harp on being a 
team and working together, fixing the little things 
that were going wrong and getting the belief back.” 
       The Lumberjacks went up early in the first 
half. In the 21st minute, the Tritons gave the 
ball away in their 18-yard box. Humboldt’s Eric 
Baumgardner took the ball down the middle 
and laid it off to Braxton Griffin, who fin-
ished past sophomore goalkeeper Jesse Brennan. 
       Sophomore defender Alec Arsht finished 
a cross from junior defender Harris Rabin to 
equalize just minutes later. But Humboldt would 
break the draw when Baumgardner broke free 
of his defender and cut into the 18-yard box.  
       Caught off his line, Brennan was forced to 
go for the ball, but clipped Baumgardner in the 
attempt. Humboldt was given the penalty kick. 

The Lumberjacks converted to take the lead. 
       “The guys at half time were upset that they 
were down 2-1,” Pascale said. “They kind of 
handed them both goals. I give [our team] a lot 
of credit. Their mentality coming into the sec-
ond half was great. They really kept it tight in 
the back. We created by far the better chances 
— probably should have had two other goals — 
and really didn’t give [Humboldt] a whole lot.” 
       Down 2-1, the Tritons continued to 
push to goal in the second half, and man-
aged to tie the game up 12 minutes in with 
a goal from junior midfielder Kian Malek. 
    Minutes after, Pascale replaced Ball with Walker 
and brought Valenciano on for Wolfrom. The 
changes clearly quickened the pace of the game 
for the Tritons, and in the 66th minute, Haroush 
dribbled through the 18-yard box and found Arsht, 
who put it away to give the Tritons the 3-2 lead. 
       “[Arsht] is a warrior,” Pascale said. “We can 
always count on him to give his best, work 
hard and make plays. You watch him and he’s 
very committed to the task, whatever that 
might be. I’m happy for him because it’s a lot 
of hard work that is being rewarded right now.” 
       Despite the wins, the Tritons won’t continue 
into the postseason. Their two remaining games 
are set for this weekend at home against San 
Francisco State on Friday, Oct. 28 and Cal Poly 
Pomona on Sunday, Oct. 30.

GOLF — The Tritons carded a sub-
par performance at the Cal State 
Monterey Bay Invitational last Tuesday, 
Oct. 23 at the Black Horse Golf Club. 
    In a field of 15 schools, the Tritons placed 
No. 14, finishing with a team score of 924 
points — 41 points behind top finishers 
CSU Stanislaus and Western Washington. 
    Freshman Jay Lim and sophomore David 
Smith were UCSD’s top performers, both 
hitting 230, 14 over par. Lim and Smith 
finished just in front of sophomore Lewis 
Simon, who hit 231 and finished 48th overall. 
    Lim, Smith and Simon have consistently 
been the top finishers for the Tritons, but 
UCSD seems to still be struggling with fill-

ing in the hole left by graduating senior Keith 
Okasaki, who was arguably the strongest 
golfer on the roster for the past four years. 
    CSU Stanislaus and Western Washington 
tied to take the team title, finishing with 887 
points apiece, 23 over par.

Sonoma State was No. 3 with a 
combined score of 890, while Nova 
Southeastern finished as No. 4. Nova 
Southeastern’s Ben Taylor took top indi-
vidual finisher merits, hitting 211. 
    The Tritons are set to return to the green 
on Nov. 7-8 to finish their fall season sched-
ule at the Sonoma State Invitational at the 
Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club.

her if she stepped on “their field.” Frankly, 
it’s because her 5-foot-10 of honed athleti-
cism made more than a few men look fool-
ish as she challenged their masculinity. But 
truly, it seemed they were confused to go 
against the societal norm of “hitting” girls. 
She was not harming them, as confused and 
testosterone-filled as high school boys can 
be, but was rather violating their view of 
right and wrong instilled from a young age. 
     The argument can be made that because 
women are not as athletic as men, the games 
are not as exciting. Biologically this is true. 
Testosterone equals muscles while estrogen 
equals higher fat levels. The sexes are differ-
ent, and men can make moves most women 
could only dream of. 

But women’s sports shouldn’t be com-
pared to men’s sports, but appreciated for 
what it is. And they are just as exciting. 

Just look at the penalty kicks of the 
Women’s World Cup final, where the 
U.S. team lost to Japan. Honestly that 
was the most I’ve bitten my nails since I 

watched Brett Favre in the Super Bowl. 
The same can be said for watching 
Serena and Venus Williams play tennis or 
Sylvia Fowls play basketball. It is just as 
fun as watching Federer or Rajon Rondo. 
    The number of women who play sports is 
vastly less than the number of men, which 
results in fewer numbers of women fight-
ing for the same amount of spots as men 
on collegiate rosters. Title IX does not take 
this into account, making it much easier 
for women to get a scholarship than men. 
The competition pool is simply smaller for 
an equivalent number of positions, which is 
due in part to the societal norms associated 
with women in athletics.

People do not watch women play because 
it makes them uncomfortable to see empow-
ered women getting hurt, and because they 
have incorrect preconceived biases that if 
they do watch, it wont be exciting. I encour-
age you to come to see the nationally ranked 
No. 18 UCSD women’s volleyball game, or 
the No. 7 ranked women’s soccer game. Both 
teams are, quite frankly, better than their 
male counterparts.

Alec Arsht (CB)    6
Wearing the armband for UCSD, the sophomore was solid in the mid�eld, while 
providing support for the backline.
Andisheh Bagheri (CM)   5.5
Created opportunities in the attacking third, but had a di�cult time keeping position 
in the mid�eld.
Sam Ball (S)    6.5
A cornerstone of the attack, Ball did well pushing forward and creating chances for 
the Tritons. His aggressiveness on and o� the ball served UCSD well against a physi-
cal Sonoma squad.
Josh Cohen (GK)    7.5
�e sophomore goalkeeper was good in the air and quick o� his line. Cohen made a 
good couple of saves to keep the Tritons in the game.
Andrew Keimach (LB)   7.5
Not the fastest defender for the Tritons, but Keimach provided a much needed 
physical toughness in the backline. Also did well to go forward into the attack, and 
ultimately, provided the assist for the game winner.
Gavin Lamming (CB)    5
As with the rest of the backline, Lamming got stuck into the tackles that he needed to 
in the defense, but o�en lost control of the ball.
Alex Portela (RM)    5
Lost possession frequently, and struggled to get into the game early on. But on the 
ball, Portela did well to maneuver his way through the Sonoma mid�eld.
Harris Rabin (RB)    6
Always consistent, the junior captain did his job in the back. Didn’t o�er much going 
forward, but had a few crucial crosses into the box.
Evan Walker (S)- Man of the Match  8
Coming o� the bench, Walker seems to be getting back into form, as he made a 
number of penetrating runs up top. His creativity and skill created crucial opportu-
nities, opening up the game, and leading to the game winner.
Taylor Wirth (AM)    7
Consistently logging major minutes for the Tritons, Wirth won his physical battles 
and proved crucial in the middle.
Cory Wolfrom (LM)   8
Tireless in running the widths for the Tritons, Wolfrom was excellent in contributing 
to the attack and falling back into position for the defense. His right footed �nish was 
top-class.
Adam Zernik (LM)    4
Hustled down the �anks, but did not make much of an impact on the game.

Nobody watches the WNBA. Around 270,000 people on average tune into a WNBA game, while the average NBA game 
garners more than 10 million viewers. This differ-
ence can be seen across the board in the sporting 
world. People, it seems, would rather watch a man 
play a game than a woman. This has wrongly been 
attributed before to women not being as exciting as 
men in sport. I believe the problem actually to be the 
sensibilities of the viewers in combination with the 
institutional system in place for women’s athletics. 
       As it stands, millions of people will tune in to 

watch NFL players beat the hell out of each other 
several times a week and cheer, jeer and generally 
have a rowdy good time. Some people get upset, 
resulting in the “no head to head contact” rule but, 
come on, what do we watch for if not that awesome 
tackle that almost takes his head off, man? 

When the Lingerie Football League came into 
existence, it encountered an interesting mix of 
viewers. Some tuning in and being excited about 
the sport, others objecting to women playing such 
a physical sport. Now, a real factor in the debate is 
the aspect of the scantily clad nature of the league, 
exemplified by the outrage of the Bible-thumpers 
as they throw down a six-pack and watch Troy 
Polamalu go head hunting. However, the real factor 
is men not wanting to see women get beaten up. 
There is just something in their minds that makes 
hitting a girl wrong, regardless if it is a girl hitting a 
girl. It’s just not what our society views as ladylike 
behavior on a visceral level.

My sister played football in Alameda for a 
couple of seasons. Starting as a kick returner, 
she encountered confusion and anger from those 
around her, both from her own teammates and 
those on the other team. Both camps called her 
names, made inappropriate slurs and in several 
cases actually told her that they were going to kill

MEN’S SOCCER — Ranked sixth in a twelve-team confer-
ence, a string of close losses has eliminated the men’s soccer 
team from any chance at a postseason. 

But on Sunday, against top of the conference Sonoma State, 
the Tritons did not look like a middle-of-the-pack squad. 

In what can only be described as a tremendous team 
effort, the Tritons went hard into every tackle, challenged the 
Seawolves all over the pitch and supported each other in the 
attack and defensively in their own half.

“Our team is playing well together because we’re committed 
to playing defense as a team,” junior forward Evan Walker said.

In the first half, the two teams both tallied three shots 
apiece. But as the half dragged on, neither team could muster a 
goal. And as the two teams retired after the first half, the match 
looked like it would shape up to be a game of attrition.

However, in the second half, with a Triton team that seemed 
to be losing its legs, sophomore midfielder Cory Wolfrom 
received a pass from sophomore midfielder Sam Ball. At the 
corner of the 18-yard box, with just enough time to fire off a 
shot, Wolfrom sent a beautiful right-footed shot that curved 
just into the opposite corner of the goal.

The goal seemed to immediately lift the Tritons, as they 
battled to hold the 1-0 advantage.

With the pressure on Sonoma to equalize, the game became 
very physical; two yellow cards were issued in the first period 
and five more were issued in the second half. 

The only red card of the game was given in the 69th minute, 
when Sonoma forward Justin Ferreira cracked a shot toward 
the bottom left corner. Sophomore goalkeeper Josh Cohen 
made a tremendous diving save to block the shot. But after 
doing well to keep the ball out of the net, Taylor Varnadore 
picked up the rebound to finish.

The Seawolves tied the game at 1-1, but Sonoma’s Jomed 
Tejan was ejected from the match after he received a red card 
for “excessive celebration.”

So with one man down for Sonoma, the Tritons 
looked to take advantage, though they were unable 
to end the game in the regulation time period. 
       Managing his substitutions well, head coach Jon Pascale 
shuffled his forwards in and out throughout the match, starting 
sophomore forwards Tsuk Haroush and Sam Ball, while bring-
ing on juniors Evan Walker and Jordan Valenciano as relief. 
    The substitutions paid off: Deep into the game, Walker made a 
number of penetrating runs into the Sonoma backline. And with 
less than a minute left in the game, Walker was denied a header. 
       Early into the second overtime period, Walker recorded 
another attempt on goal as he mishit a cross from Ball.

With just four minutes left to play, sophomore 
defender Andrew Keimach dribbled down the left 
side. Keimach found Walker who was able to drib-

The UCSD women’s soccer team was in fine form this weekend for arguably their most crucial match of the regular season.On Sunday, the Tritons — ranked first in the South 
division — faced top of the North division Sonoma State, taking a 
sound 2-0 victory from the Seawolves.

In the first half, the play was tight as the two teams battled 
for the advantage. Although the Tritons managed to outshoot the 
Seawolves 7-3 in the first period, the game remained scoreless.

“We played really well in the first half,” senior goalkeeper 
Kristin Armstrong said. “It was just that Sonoma really raised their 
level of play too.”

Just three minutes into the second period, junior midfielder 
Jessica Wi made a run with the ball down the right flank, winning 

a corner kick.
Junior defender Hayley Johnson, leading UCSD with 12 assists 

this season and scoring nearly every corner kick for the Tritons 
this year, sent a left-footed corner kick into the box. Placing the 
ball just out of the reach of the Sonoma goalkeeper, senior forward 
Sarah McTigue ran onto it, and finished the ball with a header for 
her seventh goal of the year.

After the goal, the game opened up, with the teams collectively 
taking 13 shots on frame.

The second goal came deep into the second half.
With less than five minutes remaining on the clock, Johnson 

sent a corner kick into the box. The ball landed at Wi’s feet,
