DREAMS DON’T PAY THE BILLS ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

Thursday, October 30, 2008

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

After more than a month of 
deliberation, the A.S. Council green-
lighted a campus activity fee refer-
endum last night that would raise 
student fees by a total of $19.82 per 
quarter if approved by the student 
body during the second week of 
Winter Quarter. 

Designed to pull the council 
out of a funding deficit that cur-
rently threatens to cripple A.S. 
Programming, the referendum’s pas-
sage by councilmembers has been 
hindered by a number of obstacles 
over the past several weeks, includ-
ing a last-minute addendum to fund 
a new campus sustainability center. 

At last night’s meeting, the coun-
cil debated including funding for the 
Loft, UCSD’s new nightclub, in the 
referendum. Earlier in the evening, 
University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen approached the 
council with a request that the Loft, 
currently experiencing its own 

funding shortfall, be considered for 
inclusion.

The potential addition of a $2.65 
fee per student per quarter that 
would financially support future 

Loft events proved contentious, 
as a divided council debated the 
appropriateness of requesting that 
students fund a project over which 
Associated Students has no control.

While some councilmembers 
argued that the Loft is vital to 
UCSD’s social and cultural develop-

Councilmembers discussed the passage of the activity fee referendum at a marathon meeting last night that dragged on past 2 a.m. The council was faced with 
issues such as whether to include funding for the Loft within the referendum and a decision to transfer reserve funds to A.S. Programming.

BARGAIN FEEDING FRENZY

By Sarah Alaoui
Staff Writer

The Humane Society of the United 
States revamped its legal case against 
the University of California last week, 
claiming the university still has yet to 
surrender documents proving that a 
study conducted at UC Davis in July 
that detailed the economic effects of 
Proposition 2 was not funded by any 
external interest groups. University 
officials now claim the documents do 
not exist. 

A firm supporter of Prop. 2 — the 
California measure that would improve 
farm animals’ living conditions if 
passed next week — the Humane 
Society has been waiting since July to 
receive documentation from the uni-
versity that would validate the legiti-
macy of the study’s funding sources.

“We are not trying to prove any-
thing,” said Peter Brandt, an attorney 
with the Humane Society. “We are 
just trying to get public information 
— part of that being the source of this 
study’s funding.”

The Humane Society claims that 
the UC study demonstrates a clear bias 
against Prop. 2, alleging that the infor-
mation within the study downplays the 
potential positive economic impacts of 
the measure while focusing primarily 
on its negative effects.

After reviewing the limited infor-
mation provided by the university, 
the Humane Society claims that the 
American Egg Board contributed 
financially to the study and may even 
have requested that the university con-
duct the Prop. 2 research to begin 
with. 

Humane Society representatives 
allege that any funding received from 
the AEB to conduct the study would 
effectively delegitimize the study’s find-
ings, as the AEB has a vested interest in 
seeing that Prop. 2 is not approved by 
voters. University officials, however, 
claim to possess no documented evi-
dence of the study’s relation to the 
AEB.

“We told the Humane Society a 
month earlier that we haven’t received 
any American Egg Board funding,” 
UC Office of the President spokesman 
Trey Davis said. “Such documents sim-
ply don’t exist because UC received no 
funding from the egg industry.”

The Humane Society, however, is 
still requesting documentation detail-
ing any other sources of funding.

As a state-funded entity, the uni-
versity is required by California law to 
release such documents to the public. 
The Humane Society has accused the 
university of failing to abide by these 
regulations, alleging that officials con-
tinue to withhold much of the docu-
mentation relevant to the study.

In a push to increase youth 
participation in next week’s presi-
dential election, the UC Students 
Association, in conjunction with the 
UC Students Vote! Project, has regis-
tered 42,007 UC students — includ-
ing 3,936 from UCSD — in the most 
successful voter registration drive in 
university history.

UCSD’s student voter registration 
ranked fourth nationally, topped 
only by UC Santa Barbara’s 10,241, 
UC Berkeley’s 9,425 and UCLA’s 
8,519.

UCSA Organizing Director 
Jennifer Knox said UCSA worked 
primarily through student govern-
ments, but also teamed with smaller, 
nonpartisan student organizations.

“We started out our work last 
year for the primaries, registering 
13,714 UC students to vote,” Knox 
said. “The registration initiative was 
successful because we started really 
early, with a big training session at 
UC Berkeley, where 75 students were 
trained to start work before school 

even started.”
Registrants conducted the bulk 

of the drive at student housing com-
plexes, stationing themselves over 
each of the system’s 10 campuses 
to maximize awareness and conve-
nience. They also recruited volun-
teers to assist in the effort.

UCSD A.S. Vice President of 
External Affairs Lisa Chen said 
this year’s drive has had statewide 
impacts, drawing the attention of 
public officials to the university’s 
potential as a foundation for politi-
cal leverage.

“Historically, students have been 
viewed as politically apathetic, but 
that’s changed with this election,” 
she said. “We’re going to have a huge 
impact. Just in the UC system alone, 
we made half of what California’s 

Measure to increase 
activity fee slated to 
appear before student 
body second week of 
Winter Quarter.

Drive is largest in UC 
history, placing four 
campuses at top of 
nationwide rankings for 
voter registration rate.

UCSD will hold a tree-planting 
ceremony Nov. 12 to celebrate its 
status as one of nine U.S. cam-
puses to be named “Tree Campus 
USA.”

Commemorated by the Arbor 
Day Foundation for practices in 
campus forestry, UCSD will plant 
over 100 trees during the 11:15 
a.m. event to replace the hun-
dreds of trees that have been lost 
to storms, land development and 
drought in recent years. 

The event will take place in 
a grove east of the Faculty Club 
where volunteers will plant several 
species and sizes of trees, includ-
ing 40 sugar gum, 34 “Little Gem” 
and 26 Torrey pine trees. 

The ADF, a nonprofit conserva-
tion organization on a mission to 
inspire people to plant, nurture 
and celebrate trees, is honoring 
colleges nationwide for promoting 
healthy urban forest management 
and engaging their campuses in 
environmental stewardship.

“This tree-planting event 

will raise awareness of ongoing 
reforestation efforts on our cam-
pus, and increase environmental 
responsibility among students, 
faculty and staff,” campus urban 
forester Sam Oludunfe said. “The 
trees planted will help us restore 
the diminishing tree canopy on 
campus and increase tree-species 
diversity throughout the campus 
forest.”

The standards required to 
obtain the Tree Care USA honor 
were all met by UCSD: the estab-
lishment of a campus tree advisory 
committee, evidence of a cam-
pus tree-care plan, verification of 
dedicated annual expenditures on 
the campus tree plan, involvement 
in an Arbor Day observance and 
the institution of a service-learn-
ing project aimed at engaging the 
student body.

The 2008 Undergraduate 
Library Research Prize was award-
ed to four UCSD students for their 
outstanding skills and work in 

research.
Co-sponsored by the UCSD 

Libraries and Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue, the 
prize includes cash awards of 
$1,000 and $500 for upper- and 
lower-division students, respec-
tively.

Students must present their 
research at the annual spring 
Undergraduate Research 
Conference. According to the 
Academic Enrichment Program, 
which sponsored the event, more 
than 140 UCSD undergraduates 
reported their research findings 
this year.

“The winners of this year’s 
Undergraduate Library Research 
Prize reflect the high level of intel-
lectual inquiry and accomplishment 
that UC San Diego has become 
known for,” Rue said. 

First prize in the social sci-
ences, arts and humanities went 
to international studies major Mary 
Tharin for her honors thesis on 
religion and politics in Pakistan at 
the end of the 20th century. 

Second prize in the social sci-
ences, arts and humanities went 
to senior Michael Hirshman, a his-

tory major, for his honors thesis on 
Napoleonic Spain.

First prize in the life and physi-
cal sciences went to Steven 
Shimizu, a double major in chem-
istry and chemical engineering, for 
a research project involving the 
synthesis of zinc oxide, which is 
studied widely for its optical and 
semiconductor properties. 

Second prize in the life and 
physical sciences was award-
ed to cognitive science major 
Jacqueline Acuna for her research 
on maternal behaviors related to 
infant emotions, stress and shared 
attention. 

“The UC San Diego Libraries 
are pleased to recognize this year’s 
Library Research Prize award-win-
ners,” Geisel Librarian Brian E. C. 
Schottlaender said. “They clearly 
demonstrated the outstanding 
research skills needed to achieve 
academic excellence at UCSD and 
beyond. Their thoughtful and stra-
tegic use of a wide range of library 
resources, from specialized data-
bases and library bibliographic 
tools to electronic journals and 
manuscript collections was com-
pelling.”

The university claims to be pro-
tected from disclosing the requested 
information under the Public Records 
Act, which exempts it from mandatory 
disclosure of communication between 
university research teams and research 
teams associated with private enter-
prises.

Davis said that not utilizing this 
protection could potentially jeopardize 
future research efforts.

“Disclosure of these documents 
would have a chilling effect on 
the university’s ability to conduct 
research in this and other areas in 
the future, thereby hampering [the 
UC system’s] public research mis-
sion,” Davis said.

The University of California is not 
the only public entity currently engaged 
in legal action with the Humane Society 
over Prop. 2. The measure has faced 
a number of staunch opponents over 
the past several months, leading the 
Humane Society to expand its threats 
of legal action as far as the federal 
level. The United States Department of 
Agriculture, for example, is currently 
facing a lawsuit from Humane Society 
affiliate organization Yes on Prop. 2 
for allegedly misspending $3 million 
on anti-Prop. 2 campaigning. The 
Humane Society has also accused the 
department of receiving partial fund-
ing from the AEB.

The case hearing against the 
University of California was postponed 
this week until Nov. 17. 

“If we can’t get documents from 
the university before Nov. 4, we’re not 
going to let it go,” Brandt said. “We’re 
going to keep fighting.”

Last night’s A.S. meeting was a true test of endurance, but it commenced innocently enough 
with special presentations. Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Carol-Irene 
Southworth, representing the Free 
Speech Coalition, was the trailblazing 
presenter of the evening, with a report 
on the status of the free-speech policy 
the coalition is currently drafting.

“Our goal now is to get a policy 
proposal of a brand new free-speech 
policy finished by the end of this quar-
ter and out hopefully by the end of 
Winter Quarter,” 
Southworth said.  

Paul Terzino of 
University Centers 
came forth next to 
clarify any mis-
understandings 
regarding renting 
University Centers for student organi-
zation events.  

Next up was Melissa Ewart, the 
A.S. senior graphic artist, who updat-
ed the council on the happenings of 
the A.S. Graphic Studio and promised 
uniquely designed T-shirts that adver-
tise the studio’s services for council-
members next week.

The last presentation consisted 
of University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen’s update on the 
financial status of the Loft and includ-
ed a line-itemized budget to clarify 
the running of the space and some 
of the statements Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue made last 
week regarding the Loft’s survival. 

“I think they want to make sure 
they can keep [the Loft] going,” 
Wollesen said. “But I don’t foresee 
ongoing operating costs coming from 
the vice chancellor’s office.”

Although nearly half of the coun-
cil was in favor of helping bail out 
the Loft, some of the line items on 
Wollesen’s budget raised eyebrows.

“I really want to make sure that the 
money is not devoted for BlackBerrys 
for all the interns,” Associate Vice 
President of Athletic Relations Peter 
Benesch said in reference to a line 
item for such services.

During committee reports, the 
council passed a motion to move 
$80,000 from its mandated reserves to 
the programming office for Sun God 
plans, but with the stipulation that the 
proposed activity fee referendum is 
passed by the student body.

Three hours into the meeting, the 
council’s attention 
finally turned to 
the proposed activ-
ity fee referendum.  
Conversation took 
a turn for the 
fierce following 
mention of a $2.65 

quarterly addition to the referendum 
to keep the Loft afloat.

“I am not comfortable being yet 
again the student that has to pay for 
something without the guarantee of 
oversight,” President Donna Bean 
said.

The discussion moved around in 
circles among Loft advocates, Loft 
dissenters and people who wanted 
to table the voting for yet another 
week. After making an impassioned 
statement on the lack of student con-
trol over where their fees go, Bean 
stormed out of the forum to regain 
her composure.

At the stroke of eleven, the council 
was forced to resume conversation 
across the hall, where tempers and 
patience continued to flare over the 
language and numbers on the referen-
dum as the clock ticked away.

Councilmembers finally unani-
mously passed the referendum after 
spending more time in the fourth 
floor of Price Center East than most 
people do in class on a given day.

national numbers are. Over 40,000 
new registered voters is a huge feat. 
Legislators and campaign managers 
are becoming more aware of the UC 
system as a base of power.”

At the UCSD campus, Chen 
said the California Public Interest 
Research Group and the A.S. Council 
registered the most voters, but that 
other groups — such as Students for 
Barack Obama and 
Students for John 
McCain — also 
made substantial 
contributions to 
the final tally.

In addition to 
coordinating a 
registration drive 
with the A.S. 
Council during 
Welcome Week, 
Chen led volun-
teers in register-
ing nearly 1,700 
incoming fresh-
man in the last 
three days before 
classes began.

Knox said it is possible that the 
rate of voter turnout among UC 
students will exceed the statewide 
percentage on Nov. 4, considering 
that UC student voter turnout for 
the California primary election in 
February stood at 52 percent, com-
pared to the 58 percent of California 
residents who voted.

UC campuses also participated 
in College Bowl, a national com-
petition made possible by a part-
nership between MySpace and the 
national nonpartisan voter reg-
istration groups Declare Yourself, 
HeadCount, Student PIRGs, Rock 
the Vote and the United States 
Student Association.

The winning school will be 
awarded a free concert with Death 
Cab for Cutie, and the individual 
student to register the most people 
will receive a free concert on campus 
with Colin Meloy, lead singer and 

songwriter for the Decemberists. 
UCSD came in fifth in the com-

petition, preceded by UCSB, UC 
Berkeley, UCLA and Rutgers State 
University.

“The UC schools did exceed-
ingly well since UC students are 
very active in registering themselves 
and others on campus,” said Barnett 
Zitron, director of Ultimate College 
Bowl. “It’s a culmination of the cur-

rent political and 
economic climate 
that’s causing this 
generation to 
weigh in on what 
happens.”

He said there 
has been a shift in 
political strategy 
to reach young 
people — such 
as  the creation 
of College Bowl 
— that has yield-
ed impressive 
results.

A c c o r d i n g 
to Chen, poll-
ing locations on 

the UCSD campus have tripled this 
year to avoid the three- to four-hour 
wait that was unavoidable during the 
2004 election.

All six colleges will host their own 
polling locations except for Eleanor 
Roosevelt College and John Muir 
College, which will share RIMAC 
Arena. Price Center will serve as a 
provisional polling place, but A.S. 
councilmembers are encouraging 
off-campus students to vote at their 
designated polling places if pos-
sible.

“We discourage using a provi-
sional ballot since it only gets count-
ed three weeks after the election 
and it’s a long process,” Chen said. 
“Our 43 poll workers will be ready, 
and we’re prepared for a big voter 
turnout.”

Council Postpones Decision 
to Attach Loft to Referendum 

UCSA: Student Voter Turnout 
Rate May Exceed State’s

▶ VOTERS, from page 1

ment and therefore worth funding, 
others saw the Loft’s request for cash 
as an imposition by the administra-
tion upon student funds.

“Putting the question about the 
Loft fee on our ballot will hurt the 
legitimacy of our campaign and 
the integrity of our referendum 
because we don’t have a guarantee 
of transparency and oversight over 
the money that 
will go to the Loft,” 
Vice President of 
External Affairs 
Lisa Chen said.

Others argued 
that the question 
should be left up to 
the student body, 
suggesting that 
the referendum be 
separated into two 
questions, with one 
pertaining directly 
to whether funding 
be allocated to the 
Loft.

The council 
ultimately decided 
to shelve the Loft’s proposal for the 
time being and move on to issues 
pertaining directly to the original 
referendum legislation.

Also prominent on the council’s 
agenda was the option of transferring 
$80,000 from A.S. Mandate Reserves 
to A.S. Programming in order to 
supplement the funds that would be 
raised if the referendum is approved. 

Associate Vice President 
of Programming Garrett Berg 
explained that additional funding 
would be necessary to organize a 
Sun God Festival on the same scale 

as those of previous years. He said 
that a failure to produce sufficient 
funds would yield two options for 
the popular festival: cancel the event 
entirely and save next year’s festival 
or stage a drastically smaller event 
in its place.  

“Without money from the ref-
erendum, Sun God won’t resemble 
the event that students have come to 
expect in any way,” Berg said.

The coun-
cil voted to move 
the funds from 
Mandate Reserves 
to Programming 
upon passage of 
the referendum. If 
the student body 
rejects the refer-
endum, no addi-
tional funds will be 
raised for Mandate 
Reserves — which 
is slated to gain an 
additional $0.70 
per student per 
quarter if the ref-
erendum passes — 
leaving no reserve 

funds available for Programming.
A straw poll indicated that the 

majority of councilmembers wished 
to vote on the referendum in its 
current form. Members then dis-
cussed minor issues such as future 
inflation rates and the implementa-
tion of a four-year moratorium on 
A.S. referenda, which would pre-
vent students from facing multiple 
referenda throughout their careers 
at UCSD.

Istayed up until 5 a.m. last night reading XKCD comics and watch-ing Kevjumba videos on YouTube. 
(If you know what I’m talking about on 
both counts, we need to be friends.) You 
see, I like the Internet. No — I am the 
Internet. In all seriousness, beyond the 
less intellectual subparts of e-culture, 
the Internet is a goldmine of informa-
tion, and boy do I like to mine. I have 
this slight, slight obsession in which my 
RSS reader is refreshed 24/7, my Gmail 
is checked religiously and God forbid 
a Facebook notification go unnoticed. 
My roommates and I actually had our 
first argument last Friday because I 
refused to go out with them. I was blog-
ging, OK?

Friends of mine seriously wonder 
how I scrape by without very much 
studying. I’m usually on a combination 
of Google Reader, Facebook, Wordpress, 
Delicious, Digg, Twitter, Tumblr … and 
the list goes on. Microsoft Word rare-
ly takes precedence, unless my term 
paper’s due in T-minus 15 minutes 
— and even then, I alt-tab my way 
through the next 45. Truth is, I gave 
up on academia a long time ago. Math 
went in sixth grade, when I got my first 
D — that’s life-crumbling for a 10-year-
old. I did my best to plow through sci-
ence, but honors chemistry confirmed 
I should never be honored for doing 
anything science-related. Ever. 

Several years later, my public edu-
cation is still wasting away. I put in as 

The Loft is easily the most prom-ising endeavor by UCSD to restore notoriously damaged 
school spirit, potentially even pulling 
our campus ahead of the curve in arts 
accessibility among peer universities.

Every aspect of the dream was larger 
than life: An entire week of grand-open-
ing entertainment, studded with big 
names in music, comedy, catering, film 
and visual arts — only a taste of what 
was proposed as an entire year of free 
student events and a hip place to lounge 
when the silence of Giesel Library 
became too deafening to bear. It was 
almost suspiciously awesome — how 
could a bunch of self-interested univer-
sity officials drowning in budget crises 
really be interested in tickling our tastes 
for the arts? Not that we were complain-
ing. Most of the funding was coming 
from our pockets, but embedded in 
fees we would have already been pay-
ing whether or not the university had 
the kind heart to set some aside for the 
dreamers behind the most exciting and 
progressive of all campus goings-on.

However, even after undoubtedly 
jumping hurdles to set up shop in Price 
Center East and scoring talent almost 
too good to be true — for little to no 
admission price — it turns out that, 
indeed, theirs was a dream of unrealistic 
proportions. The ambitious Loft coor-
dinators received well over $100,000 to 

fill the Fall calendar; but all is apparently 
not well in paradise, because the Loft 
is now pushing to piggyback the new 
A.S. activity-fee referendum. Whatever 
funds were expected to exist in the ini-
tial budgeting of the 2008-09 calendar 
(assuming it was that organized) are, 
unsurprisingly, nowhere to be found.

A.S. councilmembers — who 
argued ceaselessly over the Loft’s inclu-
sion in their new fee referendum at last 
night’s meeting — and the student body 
shouldn’t get righteous and resist a mea-

sly $2.65-per-quarter fee just because 
the organization is not run by students 
(realistically, the current brains behind 
the venue could do a far better job 
than some random college kid), but we 
should be cautious that this endeavor  
not become another bottomless piggy-
bank, the Grove Caffe version 2.0. We’ll 
vote the Loft into our A.S. fees for the 
time being, but such haphazard lack of 
oversight — if left unchecked — might 
not see the venue’s benefits outweighing 
its costs for much longer.

I n case anyone has forgotten, Thurgood Marshall College’s Dimensions of Culture writing 
program has been something of a point 
of contention over the last year and a 
half. The highly charged protests and 
administrative controversy that have 
surrounded the program since April 
2007, however, seem to have slipped 
almost entirely from the public con-
science recently. 

While not uncommon within the 
scope of such red tape-lined issues, 
this tendency toward gradual apathy 
among the campus community places 

the progress that has been made in 
resolving the D.O.C. problem in the 
precarious position of being subjected 
to the same administrative inattention 
that spurred the need for protest to 
begin with.

The last time D.O.C. came under 
public scrutiny was this past April, when 
a town-hall meeting held to address the 
findings of two separate curriculum 
review reports bore witness to a per-
fect display of the disillusionment with 
which students, faculty and staff had 
come to regard the program. The forum 
erupted in accusations of administrative 

disregard for student input, among lev-
eled suggestions for setting D.O.C. back 
on course with its original mission. 

Since then, the TMC administra-
tion has admittedly taken steps toward 
applying tangible change to D.O.C. The 
program’s controversial former director, 
Abraham Shragge, was ousted from his 
position following the town-hall meet-
ing, his position since being filled by 
professors Robert Horowitz and Robert 
Cancel. Additionally, the formation of a 
steering committee to guide the imple-
mentation of actual reform within the 
program has been announced, its first 

meeting to take place spring quarter.
However, the campus community 

must continue to question whether these 
efforts are enough. It was, after all, due 
to the actions of disgruntled students, 
faculty and staff that an effort to reform 
the program was originally undertaken. 
These same opponents of the stagnant 
D.O.C. curriculum must maintain their 
presence within the reform process, 
seeking to influence these proceedings 
wherever possible. Students, in particu-
lar, for whom D.O.C. exists have a duty 
to remain abreast of these issues and to 
actively seek to make their input heard.

Dear Editor,
The stock market is in terrible shape, 

the nation’s debt is nearly a trillion dol-
lars, half of Africa is starving and the 
other half is struggling with wars or 
deadly diseases, the polar icecaps are 
melting, and more and more people are 
being diagnosed with cancer. However, 
what is the big topic nowadays? You 
guessed it: gay marriage. Honestly, 
should we even be discussing this?

I’m going to be frank with every-
body: Gay people aren’t really my cup 
of tea. Even though I’ve met some gay 
people and had some friends who later 
turned out to be gay, I’ve never really felt 
comfortable around them. But the bot-
tom line is that gay people are exactly 
that: people. They are human beings 
who have feelings, and they express 
them in exceptional ways. Nevertheless, 
the “Yes on 8” supporters believe oth-
erwise. For them, gay people are Satan’s 
minions out to get the children (darn 
it, not the children again). Americans 
frequently fail at providing logical argu-
ments — it’s either the children or the 
Bible, but how malevolent and ignorant 
can someone be to literally abuse the 
emotions of the general population by 
putting children in their commercials?

My point is that the U.S. “tries” to 
portray itself as a democratic and equal 

society, but it is really terrible at living 
up to its claims. It’s none of my business 
to prevent someone else from marrying. 
It shouldn’t be anybody else’s, either. 
These people deserve to be together, 
to make it official and reap the advan-
tages of being married like everyone 
else — the sole reason being they are 
no different from us. If you still believe 
they are different from you, then you 
are badly informed.

Dear Editor,
My letter is a response to the “Juicy 

Campus a Pathetic Cesspool of Hate 
Speech” article published on Oct. 23.

I was alarmed by the writer’s sug-
gestion that Congress should amend 
the laws that currently protect the First 
Amendment rights of Internet users 
and Web site owners. Juicy Campus’ 
content is disgusting by any standard, 
but is governmental intervention the 
answer to all of life’s trivial injustices? 
Does Congress need to pass a law to 
protect college students from some 
temporary embarrassment?

The request for legislation on 
Internet content is like asking to be 
coddled by the law, and is no different 
than a child begging for his nanny. 

It is a proposal that demonstrates the 
increasing unwillingness of Americans 
to deal with their own personal and 
social problems. America needs less 
government, not more of it.

Ultimately, an individual should be 
allowed to say what he wants, and if the 
pathetic coward chooses to hide behind 
the Web site’s anonymity then I suppose 
cowardice is his right. If I ever spoke 
to the site’s founder or its contributors, 
I would surely invoke the words of 
Voltaire: “I disapprove of what you say, 
but I will defend to the death your right 
to say it.”

Dear Editor,
Although it would be improper to 

say I represent all centrists, as found-
er of the Centrist Party, I wanted to 
share why I am voting for Sen. Barack 
Obama (D-Ill.).

I am a traditional conservative, 
— meaning conserve as much as pos-
sible, and don’t waste. I don’t believe in 
entitlement programs (rich or poor). 

I believe if we don’t earn our 
money, we don’t own our money, and 
likely we won’t respect it. Ultimately, 
if you can’t respect something, you 
might waste it.

Our economic maelstrom is partly 
due to corporate entitlements and the 
leaders that bathed in them (includ-
ing politicians that relied on their 
campaign contributions, creating a 
partnership between corporations 
and government, not the people). 
Some proclaim the “free market” silly 
because we have a federally regulated 
Keynesian market (“free market” isn’t 
possible). Corporations and pundits 
don’t want the government in busi-
ness. But as soon as they’re in trouble, 
who is their daddy?

Corporations are wasting “our” 
resources to maintain a proclaimed 
higher standard of living, yet they 
don’t realize that quality of life will suf-
fer due to their actions. Corporations 
promote that “standard” to uphold 
“their” profits at “our” expense. What 
is really valuable? Security, health, 
friends, family, and above all, honor.

I was fairly evenly split between 
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and 
Obama. I like McCain because he 
works across the aisle. I like Obama 
because he discusses unpopular issues, 
but I began favoring Obama due to the 
tone of his responses and campaign. 
This upheld the tradition of honor 
better than the McCain campaign. My 
tipping point occurred after examin-
ing the two vice presidential picks. 

Gov. Sarah Palin (R-Alaska) stood 
out; her interviews, beyond the talk-
ing points she had been briefed on, 

revealed she clearly is inexperienced, 
making this a high-risk bet.

With all due respect to McCain and 
his exceptional record, America can-
not afford an inexperienced person in 
the White House. With all due respect 
to Palin, she has no foreign policy 
experience, and little understanding 
of the challenge global warming will 
place on our economy; and her energy 
policy is drill, drill, drill, above all 
other considerations.

We need a pragmatic centrist in the 
White House and Obama has held his 
ground well. Centrists right and left 
should carefully consider the short and 
long term: Think outside the box of 
right/left. Cast your vote for the most 
reasonable ticket. It’s not an easy choice, 
but it may be the most important choice 
in our lifetime, considering all that is on 
the table at this point in history.

Chairman, Centrist Party

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

much effort as is necessary to get by and 
spend the remainder of my time dab-
bling in my own endeavors. These days, 
my communication courses go highly 
undervalued on my part. 

I know, I know. I’m getting an edu-
cation worth tens of thousands of dol-
lars. I should appreciate that opportu-
nity — and I do. But for me, there are 
academic studies — the ones that come 
spelled out neatly on a four-page syl-
labus, with midterms and papers and 
finals wedged between readings — and 
then there are studies of the real world. I 
like to think of myself as a student of the 
actual, ever-dynamic communication 
field, not a student of research papers 
and theoretical analyses. Professors can 
assign all the readings they want, but 
ultimately I find far more value in my 
daily mixed bag of online reads that 
cover everything from economic trends 
to technology news. I find more value in 
actually engaging in the use of socially 
transformative technology than study-
ing what one person thought about the 
implications of such tools 10 years ago.

There’s no doubt I respect my pro-
fessors for their thorough understand-
ing of their respective fields, and I do 
realize that there’s much more I should 
be doing to make my time here worth 
it. But when people reprehend my lack 
of enthusiasm for my university studies, 
insisting that college is about enlighten-
ment and critical thinking, I have to 
argue: Isn’t higher education supposed 
to be about stretching our minds? My 
courses only stretch my thinking so 
far. Maybe, in my inattentiveness to 
my academics, the year the radio went 
mainstream or the definition of “con-
duit metaphor” will pass me by, but 
still, it’s not me that’s not milking all the 
potential I have to learn. Our in-class 
studies are but a fraction of all that we 
should be absorbing in these four years. 
It’s those who are spending their time 

holed up in the library, poring over 
oft-irrelevant material when there is so 
much more to observe in current soci-
ety that changes by the day — they’re 
the ones who are missing out. 

I have to question: Are the stu-
dents who know all the answers to pop 
quizzes even here out of their thirst 
for knowledge or the false sense of 
job security that comes with a college 
degree? Is it actually me who doesn’t 
care about learning? Though I have 
this purported distaste for my com-
munication major, the truth is that I 
am wholly obsessed with the field. But 
instead of simply hitting the books, 
I spend my time living, reading and 
breathing it. 

Every day we experience ground-
breaking politics, a fluctuating economy 
and cutting-edge innovation. Modern 
communication has been irreversibly 
revolutionized with the onset of Web 
2.0 and new media; the Internet has 
become such a seamless part of our 
lives that we hardly notice how it has 
been able to renovate our thinking. Not 
to take advantage of your real-world 
studies and the unlimited access you 
have to all that’s out there — that’s a far 
greater loss than playing hooky on your 
morning class. Call me jaded, but in my 
eyes, a self-driven learning experience is 
not only mentally worthwhile, it’s plenty 
more applicable to life after college than 
the lecture hall learning of your average 
student. 

Nevertheless, I realize that seeking 
out your own applications of learning 
and gaining knowledge through institu-
tional studies aren’t mutually exclusive 
endeavors. I know there’s a lot to be 
said about my learning style (or lack 
thereof), and thus my personal goal is 
to find a little more worth within the 
classroom. But — and I promise to step 
off my soapbox now — I hope the rest 
of you remember to find a little more 
outside of it.

Franki Chan & the Toxic Avenger
THE LOFT/ HALLOWEEN / 8 P.M. / FREE

If you’re stuck on campus this Halloween, don’t let the night culminate 
with a burrito at OVT — head to the Loft for an abrasive DJ set/masquerade. 
Costumed like a classic slasher villain, the Toxic Avenger hails from France, the 
very country that perfected hyper-distorted bass and choppy breaks with the 
Ed Banger crew. Like most MySpace-spawned DJs, Toxic only has a few original 
tracks and a number of remixes to his name, but that hasn’t stopped him from 
embarking on a U.S. tour with Franki Chan, L.A.-based party extraordinaire 
and founder of the IHEARTCOMIX blog. Chan’s set should range from Viceified 
detached techno to ironic dance jams a la Girl Talk, tricks and treats. (CK)

“Rosemary’s Baby”
 LA JOLLA MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART/ OCT. 30 / 7 P.M. / $5

Poised to reincarnate the ghostly spirits, Roman Polanski’s ’68 U.S. 
debut “Rosemary’s Baby” pitches mousy Mia Farrow with a demonic bun 
in the oven — sans anti-Christ allusions of biblical grandeur — just in 
time for the holidays. As a nymph-like housewife with an infamous haircut, 
Farrow investigates the “Sleepy Hollow” landscape of her Manhattan 
home, trying to uncover the truth behind her abnormal pregnancy and her 
neighbor’s umbral history. The macabre dance of death that ensues has 
certainly turned this October rental into a cult classic fitting for the silver 
screen a second spooky time around. (EG)

Cattle Decapitation & Bumbklatt
THE CHE CAFE/ HALLOWEEN / 7 P.M. / $10

The Che got some disturbing local and international grind for its lil’ 
Halloween bash this year. Start with Shoot ‘Em in the Head, a death metal outfit 
with Satan-spawn vocals and a healthy helping of double-bass rattle. Then 
Crime Desire shreds some morbid SD thrash. Ritual Torture takes Metallica 
speed metal and turns up the demonic influence, while Bumbklatt’s French 
and accented English barks, like a good horror flick, are are both comical and 
frightening. And the finisher, Cattle Decapitation, sounds like an evil pirate 
shanty with the Locust’s spastic repugnance and Converge’s heavy hate. Wear 
a whimsical costume if you want a fistfight. (CK)

LO QUE ME
TIENE LOCA:
GETTIN’ LOW 

ON LATIN TIME

P ardon my insensitivity in saying that there was, after all, some-thing sweet to come of the looting, 
pillaging and raping of Central and 
Southern America at the gray dawn 
of the 16th century; that is to say, 
somewhere in the unpleasant colli-
sion of Spanish conquistadors, African 
slave ships and Native Americans, an 
impeccable constellation of the bomb-
est DNA in the universe aligned — the 

most streamlined evolution since natu-
ral selection — and from within all that 
painful readjustment transpired the 
most impeccably formed backside yet 
known to man. The ripest damn ass-
gourd that ever did grow. And — to 
the brand-new Afro-Latin beat — it 
shook. Like nothing before it, nothing 
since; until now, half a millennium 
later, when the shake-stuffs of Earth’s 
most bangin’ population can finally 
thrive as intended: in the crests and 
dips of motherfucking reggaeton.

Yeah, it’s like that. Some keyboards 
peel through for suspense. A rubber-
band bass drum slingshots the first 
beat, and our heart is pulled from 
our throat down to the very pit of 
our stomach and — bum, ba dup-
bup — it’s now being pumped for us, 
hooked to the dangerously catchy life 
support of Dem Bow (named after 
the first dancehall tune to carve that 
groove). The beat pops some popcorn, 
fires some crackers and, in an exhaust-
ing series of climaxes, folds inward on 
its own thunder for a thump so round 
we can’t help but bounce off. Just like 
that.

Reggaeton’s web of origins is far too 
tangled to trace, but I’ll safely say its 
key trademarks sprang up most offi-
cially in 1990s Central America, where 
Jamaica’s stoned Rasta sway got the 
chill pulled out from under it by furi-
ous torrents of United States hip-hop 
— cuing rappers like the Panamanian 
El General to try their luck at Spanish 
spoken-word. (Of course, New York-
style soul samples were substituted 
with remixed Latin-dance traditions 
on the beat machine, until there was 
no feasible way to turn that shit up 
any hotter.)

I have made an almost full-blown 
career of playing devil’s advocate for 
shitty music that makes people happy: 
As the saying goes, fuck art — let’s 
dance. But by the end of my junior year 
of college, sick to death of “Umbrella” 
and “What You Know” — sure, they 
were ill, but synths that raw can only sit 
out for so long without growing some 
mold — I was hungry and desperate on 
the trail for something to sweep me off 
my fucking feet already, to recapture 
that first hit, to make me wild without 
a choice in the matter. So yeah, you 
might say I was an easy target when the 
permeating stench of “Gasolina” — the 
first reggaeton track to spin on a real 
global axis, a lucky break for the rattly, 
slightly subpar Daddy Yankee — final-
ly came to my full attention, snarey 
blips tripping all over each other so 
gratingly I sort of couldn’t hide my 
hard-on anymore. What left to do but

A GOOD FIGHT 
ALWAYS ENDS

M oral injustice, despotic corruption, maternal strength — such age-old yarns of the human condition 
are pulled and frayed in “Changeling,” 
a drama that polishes gritty realism 
to a gothic sheen. Set in 1920s Los 
Angeles, the film chronicles the story 
of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) as 
she searches for her missing son. What 
she finds instead, however, is the hor-
rifying underbelly of a society braced 
by evil — a discovery that stretches 
her once-private search to universal 
proportions.

Through the lens of director Clint 
Eastwood (known for academy dar-
lings “Million Dollar Baby” and “Mystic 
River,” and for being a generally bad-
ass 78-year-old), the plot moves some-
times in alarming hurdles, sometimes 
in deliberate suspense and never with-
out confidence or exactitude. From the 
first scene in the 140-minute saga, we 
teeter on seat’s edge — eyes glued, pop-
corn bag motionless, waiting for the 
next veering turn, each so harrowing it 
could only be based in truth.

Hard to swallow, too, that Jolie is 
human — her gargantuan lips are even 
more alienlike and unavoidable when 
slathered with deep-red lipstick, leap-
ing from a washed-out backdrop of 
pinks and grays. Here, Eastwood’s use 
of color serves to energize an era typi-
cally construed in monochrome drab, 
easing us into a world that feels at once 
painstakingly authentic and hauntingly 
surreal. He lets us  linger here, just long 
enough to get comfortable, before we 
snowball into madness with one bril-
liant scene. 

The tinkering soundtrack provides a 
delicate scattering of notes as Christine 
returns from her job as a supervisor at 
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph, eager 

to see her son. Opening the door, she 
calls his name — but Walter isn’t there. 
The piano drops in brimming alarm. 
She exhausts every room. Searches the 
streets. Calls the police — who tell her 
to wait a requisite 24 hours before call-
ing back. Those huge red lips tremble 
in panic, white knuckles gripping the 
phone, as she spins worst-case scenar-
ios. When even the police refuse help, 
what’s there to do but worry? 

Indeed, these are only the begin-
nings to a sweepingly beautiful end. 
Jolie’s internal dramas are profound, 
possessed by the visceral fears of essen-
tially every mother on Earth. Her 
expert restraint is taut with personal 
understanding (and as mother to her 
own gaggle of multiracial orphans, it’s 
unsurprising). Where the role might 
invite melodrama or needless embel-
lishment, Jolie remains faithful to her 
character’s sense of womanhood and 
dignity. Even at the most desperate or 
despondent moments (to say anything 
more would be a spoiler) Jolie resists 
the temptation to stray from cool resil-
ience. Without demanding to be seen, 
we see her under an even more alluring 
light. In delivering Eastwood’s vision, 
she lets a truly terrific story tell itself. 

Because, after all, the story is not 
exclusively about a mother’s resistance, 
but the very evils she resists, the fail-
ings of those we unquestionably trust 
and hold accountable. With one fell 
swoop, Collins plunges from safe famil-
iarity into a place where the police can’t 
help her — nor her doctor, nor her 
psychiatrist. Her protests discarded by 
systematic oppression, she is left in an 
isolation that feels almost dystopian. 

 And then there are those who offer 

fatalist drama examines the resilience of a 
mother’s will in the face of staggering odds

An annual addition to a franchise in its fifth year of psychopathic thrills, 
“Saw V” — a film that undoubtedly cost less to assemble than a bookcase 
from Ikea — spilled into theaters last week with hopes of pilfering the pockets 
of angsty teens everywhere. Cheap production aside, the horror has become a

MTV’s obsessed, MySpace kids can’t get enough — even Reebok wants a piece of the action. With only one album to her name — the aerobicized Pop-Up — French princesse Yelle has begun 
to carve her giant “Y” insignia into everything that moves and makes 
money: Armed with ’80s-rave outfits, Technicolor tunes and an infectious 
accent to boot, she is the new material girl for the hipster circle. Plus, her 
name screams marketable: YEL is an acronym for You Enjoy Life, embel-
lished with the French feminine “elle” (watch your back, Madonna).

Before Yelle became an acid-wash fanatic, the shy, small-town girl 
went by Julie Budet. She grew up on the pop of her father, a famous 
musician in the Côtes d’Armor region, so when she met Beastie Boys-
influenced producer GrandMarnier at a party, the two hit it off and 
cobbled together an album. Their vision? As Yelle told Format maga-
zine: “Do what you want ... just find good harmonies and rhythms and 
make people dance.” 

This sensibility, along with producer TEPR’s rock backdrop, 
grounds her love for tecktonik — an experimental genre she adopted 
as personal obsession, describing it as “very gender bending. The 
guys wear very fitted clothing, and they like to make out with each 
other to piss off the girls. A bit gay, but not too over the top.” Watch 
any of Yelle’s music videos, and it’s easy to see the homo-show in full 
parade, brimming with outrageous Bowie-inspired outfits and wink-
ing rainbow lights that line up well with her brand of hip ’80s-esque 
psychedelia. One scene from “Ce Jeu” sees her posing in a candy-
striped catsuit against a matching candy-cane background. Needless 
to say, it’s pretty trippy stuff.

Strung-out influences aside, Yelle’s noise consists of singsong rap, 
dirty French quips, sugar-coated synthesizers and body-bumping 
beats. Most tracks are typical dance-party fare, but a few possess 
major star power: “Ce Jeu” earns its spot as hit single with its Willy-
Wonka electronica and melodic, hand-clap percussion, “85A” 
celebrates small breasts and “Mon Meilleur Ami” is an ode to sex 
toys. The lesbian-themed “Les Femmes” seduces us with slinky 

electro-buzzes, snap-clap drum beats and blushing vocals. 
Yelle’s appeal to the American Apparel crowd is clear: she 

is fresh-faced innocence, talking dirty in tight pants. No 
wonder we can’t seem to look away.

Yelle will perform live at Price Center Plaza on 
Nov. 3 at noon.

H er mind is a haunted house,” reads the first line of Nadeem Aslam’s 336-page panora-ma of war-torn Afghanistan, a dense suc-
cession of snapshots so uncensored and honest 
they require of us a certain tolerance for pain. 

The Pakistan-born author hubs her plot in 
the haunted house of Marcus Caldwell, an old 
Englishman who has lost everyone he has ever 
loved to the country’s mass cemetery. All of its 

walls are riddled with bullet holes and hidden portraits of Taliban-
forbidden love and passion, but the most important room is one 
in which Marcus’ wife has nailed all their books to the ceiling to 
protect them from terrorist raids. From time to time, a book sym-
bolically falls to the floor, spilling passages from prose and poetry 
into Aslam’s narrative, which is of course rhythmically beautiful 
in its own right.

In search of a brother missing in action, the Russian Lara 
Petrovna lands on Marcus’ doorstep, soon followed by American 
philanthropist David Town. Under the sloping roof, their lives 
begin to intertwine — an unexpected twist that loses a little of 
its novelty after at least four changes in perspective and subse-
quent retellings, each rattled off in the same limited voice. Rocky 
transitions from one narrator to the next occur every three 
seconds, switching from third to second person at jarring inter-
vals. Although vivid landscape imagery draws all our senses into 
awareness, scattered lines bordering on unnecessary quickly kill 
that buzz.

Afghanistan has certainly spent its 15 minutes in post-9/11 
book-club circles — care of Khaled Hosseini’s “The Kite Runner” 
and “A Thousand Splendid Suns” — but “Vigil” cannot be writ-
ten off as trend. Suicide bombers Bizhad and Casa provide two 
of its narratives, giving depth to a likely target of fear-driven 
assumptions and delicately revealing the internal workings of their 
country’s long and complex struggle.

HIP-HOP AT THE PUB

If you’ve ever flashed that all-powerful student ID and sardined yourself into Porter’s for a live show, you know how all-wrong the concert room 
is — a haphazard structure lined in nappy carpet, with 
weird corner angles and puzzling columns right where 
any normal mosh pit would try to be; let’s just say 
there doesn’t seem to have been an architect or interior 
designer involved. But it’s hard to feel like part of any 
scene when it’s not a little lived-in (cough cough, Loft) 
— the Pub has a rich history of hip-hop shows that 
squeeze their DJs and mic-rats onto that awkward, 
dusty-black stage and force us right into their line of 
fire, a sweaty little community that never forgets to take 
a beer break.

Tonight’s deliciously obscure set list is so packed, 
the talent could probably fill the entire audience space 
as well: At least seven fired-up undergrounders will 
be making the trafficked commute down from Los 
Angeles this afternoon, ready to fill the already crawl-
ing pub with the kind of scene only our uber-urban 
northern star could breed. At the front lines fly the 
smooth sails of Shawn Jackson — grounded in a retro, 
dressed-sharp old school — and the Mr. Liffy weasel-
flow of Godlee Barnes,  followed up by unadvertised 
star of the evening, the groovy, snaky Blu, best known 
for his work with producer Exile. 

La-La Land ain’t skimping on the boards, either. 
We got wiggly space-hopper Ras_G, the 
chopped and screwy Samiyam and 
big man on campus DJ House 
Shoes, four albums under his 
belt and a regular list of guest 
stars. Also along for the ride 
is San Diegan (represent!) DJ 
Artistic, spilling his marbles 
all over the pub’s squeeze-
space. It’s OK — we like when 
things get messy around here.

Porter’s Pub will host a live 
hip-hop show on Oct. 30 at 
7:30 p.m.

Pac 10
■ Franchise Players
MAGNETIC FLUX

L et’s face it — San Diego ain’t exactly known for its hip-hop. Overshadowed by the high-profile Los Angeles two hours north, even the flashiest MCs and producers have trouble snagging a second glance. With 
their debut album Franchise Players, local boys Pac 10 show that, while 
San Diego may not be Hollywood, we’ve got something worth listening to 
down here, too, bitch. 

The whopping 11 members of Pac 10 (not that numbers matter in 
hip-hop — how many people are in Jurassic 5, again?) pass the mic and 
production duties seemlessly, each verse flowing into the next, each beat 
building on the last. Players starts off on a determined note with “A Day in 
the Life Of…,” a passport to the hallways of the lackluster music industry 
in “America’s Finest City.” One somber flute meets the lyrical melancholy 
with hollow despair. Just two tracks later, the tempo jumpstarts, the bass 
weighs heavier and the mood waxes a whole lot lighter. In “Need It, Want 
It,” the crew spits over a club-worthy beat about a girl who’s “obsessed with 
photos” and “likes collecting logos.”

And while “Need It, Want It” could be Gov. Sarah Palin’s new theme 
song — considering her $150K, designer-label wardrobe — Pac 10 gets 
downright political on a couple other tracks, questioning the govern-
ment’s obsession with fighting terrorism while failing to admit its own 
terrorist activities on the song “Domestic Threats.”

Pac 10 covers all the bases of SoCal free-livin’ with equally varied pro-
duction techniques, ranging from soulful joints to those recalling Sunspot 
Jonz’s work on the Legends album, Angels Wit Dirty Faces. Players makes 
an overall solid debut effort, appealing to underground aficionados and 
casual dabblers alike. Most importantly, Pac 10 prove that you don’t have 
to go up to the Bay or L.A. to cop some of that fresh Cali sound.

Jenny Lewis
■ Acid Tongue
WARNER BROS.

S plitting from the norm of genre darlings Rilo Kiley, lead singer Jenny Lewis tries out a new, life-battered persona on solo effort Acid Tongue. Her languid voice mulls the trials and tribulations of a small-town cast, 
hopelessly in love and lonely in their habits. But by trying to adhere to the 
traditions of soul-tugging wailers of yore, Lewis comes off as overly self-con-
scious, lacking distinguishing affectations to make her anything more than a 
wannabe lady of the canyon, a la Joni Mitchell.

Surrounding herself with the likes of Chris Robinson, Zooey Deschanel 
& M.Ward, Elvis Costello — even her own sister and estranged father 
— Lewis puts herself in appropriate company to create a romanticized 
account of dusty life on the road. Her springy voice lends itself naturally to 
her subject — something that can’t be said for Costello, whose strained lyrics 
come from left field on “Carpetbaggers,” discordantly competing with Lewis’ 
twang. Simple non-Pro-Tooled arrangements avoid overproduction, aiming 
for gospel and blues earnesty; however, when such polished songs attempt 
the rugged sound of a live road band, they miss authenticity and nosedive 
into borderline pretention, unfair for a singer with obvious talent.

Many of the songs feel like deja vu, and while “The Next Messiah” is 
intended as an ode to Barbra Streisand and the devil (interchangeable sub-
jects, really), it fails to merge three melodies that could be their own songs. 

Granted, not many people of us would choose to be in a band with our 
exes, so Lewis Stevie-Nicksed herself a solo career with Rabbit Fur Coat, a 
debut superior album to this sophomore effort. Though it’s admittedly pleas-
ing to turn off the lights and let Lewis’ voice fill a room with tales of distrust 
and being wronged, her attempt at seductive Appalachia is littered with mis-
steps, leaving us feeling like we’ve been there, done that, too.

Jenny Lewis will perform live at Price Center Theater on Nov. 1.

Eagles of Death Metal
■ Heart On
DOWNTOWN 

H eart On sees the Eagles of Death Metal’s formula finally perfected, a collection of infectious, flirtatiously simple tracks with 
no substantial underpinning apart from shared 
celebration of hedonistic escapism. Lead singer 
Jesse Hughes muses on tight pants, hot girls 
and fast cars, reveling in one-liners and catchy 
come-ons. 

Concise choruses and tight, compact riffs form 
the core of each track, laid over a minimal beat 
and swirling around occasional bursts of percus-
sion, keyboard and the oddly competing guitar 
solo. Tracks miss variation, the same selection of 
chords repetitively underlying dissonant vocals. 
But never mind — their brief duration prevents 
the induction of monotonous oblivion. 

“Wannabe in L.A.” epitomizes the group’s 
shtick, a short tribal intro giving way to a 
perfectly balanced ode to retro rock that ends 
before it exhausts its novel simplicity. The swag-
ger screams of Queens of the Stone Age and 
White Stripes — though not quite on par in 
lyrical weight, as Hughes croons the follies of 
his own debauchery. But hey, what about that 
band name?

The Eagles of Death Metal will perform live in

Technically, Puerto Rico is the core 
of reggaeton’s heat, but Valparaíso, 
Chile, did me just fine. Not every lost 
little white girl on a spiritual quest to 
reignite her dance party can be so for-
tunate as I, stumbling upon — albeit 
after a few slow months of more Pablo 
Neruda digs than my quirky-nauti-
cal-art reflex could realistically handle 
— a group of Chilean nightcrawl-
ers with uncanny radar for every last 
cheap, dirty, beery reggaeton bar in 
every last cranny of the Catholic port 
town in which I was “studying.” And 
oh, we raped and we pillaged.

It’s difficult to comprehend how a 
base-beat so simple — ridden by lyrics 
that unfailingly address the hotness of 
dancing with each other, pretty dirty, 
right here right now — could so avoid 
my greedy attempts to grasp its source 
of power, which would of course cue 
my fade to disinterest, as with so many 
fascinations I’d held before it.

But I’m still glued — even emo-
tionally so. All-time-favorite “Nadie 
Como Tu,” by Wisin y Yandel, oozes 
in bass farts, footnoting every pick-
up line with an irresistible shout-out 
referencing Don Omar’s guest appear-

ance or how goddamn royal they all 
are; then there are the horny hydrogen 
screeches slid sharp between layers of 
violin on Calle 13’s “Tocarte Toda,” 
or Hector El Bambino’s stuffy-then-
airy growl on the psychotic zip of “El 
Telefono.” Someone will start banging 
on some other surface or impulsively 
switch the pitch or, why not, heap on 
some more snare as a little gift for our 
long-blown-out speakers. It’s sensory 
overload — that state of excitement 
in which our chests are unclear as 
to whether we should scream or cry, 
or maybe we just need to burp or 
something — and then, in this help-
less state, we’re positively pummeled 
through the brain by a bass-pedaled 
fist — BUM, ba dup-bup — that could 
probably kill a small cow. It’s enough 
to make even the humblest booty 
double in size right then and there, or 
at least prompt us to air-slap a simi-
larly fat one while also air-holding said 
invisible victim in place with the other 
hand. You should try it sometime 
— when you get really good, you can 
even start embellishing on the antici-
pated dup-bup. And if that isn’t art, I 
don’t know what is.

Up next week: motherfucking cumbia.

Oozing with 
charm only the 
British could 
squeeze out of the 
Holocaust and 
World War II, 
“The Guernsey 
Literary and Potato 
Peel Pie Society” is 
comfort food for 

all those still wracked with Bridget 
Jones withdrawals. The New York 
Times bestseller is an always-sweet, 
sometimes-gushy collection of letters 
to and from the desk of Juliet Ashton, 
a promising author with a killer case 
of writer’s block. 

In her search for a muse, Juliet 
writes to a motley gang of social misfits 
from the Channel Island of Guernsey. 
Yet she soon realizes that their make-
shift “literary society” is only a cover 
for legally hanging out after curfew 
— a much-needed breather from the 
omnipresent German occupation.

Although their back-and-forth 
is initially hard to follow, the letters 
are well buffered by correspondence 
from Juliet’s editor and longtime 
flame Sidney Stark, as well as loaded 
American prick Mark Reynolds, who 

spends most of the novel convinc-
ing Juliet she’d be much happier loll-
ing around his mansion back in the 
States, while Sidney insists she remain 
a devoted pen pal to the Islanders. 

For a letterless second half, Juliet 
takes her editor’s advice and then some, 
relocating to the heart of the action 
and falling even more in love with 
her new friends. But with visits from 
both Sidney and Mark, Juliet’s love 
triangle takes the forefront, a nuisance 
for those of us far more infatuated with 
the mischievous book club — who by 
now deserve a novel all their own.

But whoever’s story is being told, 
a saving faith in the written word 
threads the patchwork narrative. As 
Amelia, one of the society’s found-
ing members, puts it: “We read 
books, talked books, argued books 
and became dearer and dearer to one 
another. Other Islanders asked to join 
us, and our evenings together became 
bright, lively times — we could almost 
forget, now and then, the darkness 
outside.” Although this gem won’t be 
making literary canons anytime soon, 
Shaffer and Barrows manage to illu-
minate an oft-overshadowed corner of 
wartime living.

to help when her strength is hanging 
from its final thread. What makes 
the brutal succession of misfortune 
in “Changeling” bearable is not the 
admirable courage of its protago-
nist, but a reassurance that there is 
some good left in the world. John 
Malkovich electrifies as a truth-her-
alding reverend, and Amy Ryan tugs 
heartstrings as a charming psych-
ward whore who deviantly quips that 
sometimes, you gotta say “Fuck you, 
and the horse you rode in on.”

The only real failing of the movie 
is perhaps a scene in its conclud-
ing half-hour, when the sappy piano 

twinkles return over an extreme 
close-up of Jolie’s face. Her swollen 
lips crowding the screen, she declares 
that yes, there’s still “hope” to be had. 
Well, no shit — after all the court-
house hearings, murderer run-ins 
and dials to every missing-child hot-
line imaginable, it’s sort of obvious 
you’re the hopeful type. 

No, her best line (one indicative of 
the film’s grounding premise) comes 
at the film’s opening scene, when she 
tells Walter that one should “never 
start a fight — but always end it.” 
Clearly, her triumph proves that jus-
tice is always worth fighting for.

MEN’S SOCCER — For any col-
legiate athletic team, Senior Day is 
a special event — a chance for the 
home faithful to show their support 
for those players who 
have dedicated a col-
lege career’s worth of 
effort to representing 
their university.

For the UCSD men’s 
soccer team, Senior 
Day transformed from a ceremony 
honoring their veterans to a show-
case of sudden virtuosity as they 
routed Seattle Pacific University 5-0 
at Triton Soccer Field on Oct. 25. 

The Tritons racked up two goals 
from senior forward Tony Fernandez 
and one apiece from senior forward 
Tom Caplan, sophomore defend-
er Aaron McDowell and junior 
defender Kyle Parton as they con-
tinued their late surge toward the 
postseason. The UCSD squad has 
relied heavily on its seniors all sea-

son, and this match proved no dif-
ferent, with older members of the 
bunch getting on the board early 
on. Fernandez opened the scoring 
streak for the Tritons, driving a pass 
by Caplan home for a 1-0 starting 
advantage. The team struck again 
only four minutes later, as junior 
midfielder Tony Choi put a beauti-
ful corner kick into the box that 
found McDowell with enough space 
to fire a shot that doubled the lead 
and marked the fourth season goal 
for the aggressive defender.

The squad could have been con-
tent to sit on their 2-0 
halftime lead, but the 
Tritons seemed deter-
mined to put on a dis-
play for their home-
town crowd in the last 
home game of the sea-

son. Fernandez tallied his second 
score of the match in the 56th min-
ute as he snuck a shot past Seattle 
Pacific goalkeeper Kaleb Kuehn, 
taking a nice pass from sophomore 
midfielder David Bakal for a team-
leading fifth goal of the season. 

Team captain Caplan made his 
own mark on the match in the 68th 
minute, knocking home a header 
off a perfect corner kick from Choi. 
The goal was the third of the season 
for Caplan. The final tally of the 
match arrived in the 74th min-

ute, with an own goal by Falcon 
defender Jono Henness, who put a 
header past his own keeper. Parton 
was credited with the score for the 
Tritons.

Senior goalkeeper Peter Akman 
made three saves through 80 min-
utes, posting his eighth shutout of 
the season before giving way to 
freshman Ryan McDowell, who 
made his debut for the Tritons.

The win was the third in four 
matches for the Tritons and pushed 
their overall record to 9-5-2. The 
team currently owns a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
record of 5-5-2 and remains in third 
place in the South Division with 
17 points. The Tritons will finish 
the season with a home record of 
6-2-2.

Head coach John Pascale cred-
ited his team’s superior condition-
ing as a key factor in the beating the 
Tritons handed the Falcons.

“We have really pushed the guys 
hard from a fitness standpoint and 
it really paid off,” Pascale said. “We 
just played at a faster speed and had 
a lot of energy in our legs.”

He also pointed to the high level 
of competition that teams have to 
face day in and day out in the 
CCAA as a reason for the easy non-

Relentless Offense Nets Record-Breaking Victory

ROWERS 
NOTCH A 

VICTORY IN 
FIRST RACE

BLOWOUT SETS UP SWIMMERS FOR TESTS TO COME

By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

SWIVE — If the Tritons were rusty 
from the offseason, it didn’t show dur-
ing their first competition since mid-
March. Kicking off the 2008-09 season 
right, the UCSD swimming and diving 
team completely dominated its dual 
meet against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
on Oct. 25 at home.

The team won 29 out of 32 events, 
crushing the Stags 202-90 in the meet. 
But while the win was a plus, the squad’s 
main focus wasn’t on victory. 

“Mainly, we just wanted to get in 
and swim in our first competition in 
awhile,” senior captain Daniel Perdew 
said. “It was good for our freshmen 
to compete and get the race strategy 
down.”

Senior captain Steven Hardy showed 
strong racing technique, outlasting his 
opponents on the starts and turns to 
claim victories in the 200-yard freestyle, 
200-yard individual medley and 200-
yard backstroke races. 

Perdew also garnered three indi-
vidual wins in the meet in the 50-yard 
freestyle, 100-yard freestyle and 100-
yard butterfly.

On the women’s side, the CMS 
backstrokers were no match for sopho-
more backstroker Anju Shimura, who 
won both the 100-yard and 200-yard 
races handily. Shimura’s time of 59.01 

seconds was the only swim under one 
minute in the 100-yard event.

UCSD also won all four relays of the 
day, with the women’s 200-yard medley 
relay being the only close race. 

The Tritons pulled solid swims 
from a few members of their large 
freshmen class. Freshman Alexandra 
Henley burst strong off the starting 
block in the 200-yard individual med-
ley race, building a lead early and never 
letting up, finally winning the race by 
almost four seconds with a time of 
2:10.71. Freshman Shea Kopp also had 
a good showing for UCSD, sprinting 
to a first-place finish in the 50-yard 
freestyle event.

The freshmen’s ability to adjust 
from high school to college competi-
tion will be a huge factor in how the 
team performs this season. Since the 
Tritons did not graduate many swim-
mers last season, the rookie class has 
the potential to make a real difference 
for the squad.

“I think the freshmen are adjusting 
really well and are doing an amazing 
job,” Panis said. “It’s one of the stron-
gest freshmen classes we’ve had. Some 
of them can and will compete at the 
national level — they’re very talented. 
They swam really well [against CMS] 
and are ready for college competition.”

Swimming against CMS was even 
harder for the rookies because, as a dual 
meet, the Tritons didn’t rest before the 

competition. 
“They did very well but some of 

them were a little nervous,” head coach 
Scott McGihon said. “It’s a team policy 
not to rest for dual meets so we’re not 
really sure how they’ll be able to swim.” 

Even though the team is happy with 
its win over CMS, the Tritons know the 
real test will be at their next meet, when 
they host Cal State Bakersfield and UC 
Davis on Nov. 8. 

“The Bakersfield men have a good 
team and the women are in a growth 
period right now,” McGihon said. 
“They should both be tough races.” 

Facing UC Davis might prove to 
be an even harsher assignment for 

the Tritons, as they haven’t beaten the 
Aggies in four years.

“It’s been a while since we beat 
Davis in a dual meet — not since they 
moved to Division I and have more 
resources,” McGihon said.

After finally getting in their first 
meet, the Tritons now understand 
where they need to improve in prepa-
ration for the upcoming competitions. 

“Everybody’s going to be in shape 
eventually this season,” Perdew said. 
“We just need to work on the small 
things like starts and turns.”

CREW — In addition to all the 
buzz about Halloween, the month 
of October marks Breast Cancer 
Awareness Month, in which chari-
ties around the world put on events 
to increase breast cancer awareness 
and raise funds for its research. 

On Oct. 25, the UCSD crew 
teams participated in their seventh 
annual Row For the Cure, hosted by 
the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 
Foundation. Held at Mission Bay, the 
fundraiser marked the Tritons’ first 
race of the season. In the women’s 
collegiate-eight A and B team race 
against Chapman University, UCSD 
came out on top, the varsity-eight 
boat surging toward the finish line 
with a time of 17:30. The Panthers 
were left to follow in UCSD’s wake, 
coming in a little over a minute 
later.  

According to senior co-captain 
Alissa Kispersky, the team’s success is 
fueled by its desire to take on larger 
rivals. 

“I think the team has a lot of heart 
this year,” said Kispersky. “Every sin-
gle athlete is doing her part to make 
the team better. We may not have 
height or size on the other teams, but 
we are coming after them anyway.”

Fellow senior co-captain Kelly 
Hansen explained how the Tritons 
value their strategy as opposed to 
their physical abilities. 

“We have been using our fall 
season to perfect our technique and 
aerobic base,” Hansen said. “When 
traveling to races, we are often seen 
as the ‘New York City Skyline Crew’ 
because we are all different shapes 
and sizes, unlike most of the other 
schools, who are usually all really

starts and turns. Top: The Tritons earned mixed results in their butterfly events against Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps, splitting the 100-yard and 200-yard events for both the men’s and women’s teams.

conference win.
“I think we have by far the tough-

est conference in the country in 
Division II,” Pascale said. “We have 
been playing a lot of tough teams and 
it has certainly prepared us.”

As one of five seniors honored 
before the game, Akman was happy 
to get the win but admitted it was 
tough to finish his home career.

“It has been such a great sea-
son, it is tough for all of us to say 
goodbye,” Akman said. “Our staff has 
been unbelievable; the young guys 

are lucky to get a chance to continue 
to work with them.”

Pascale, in his first year as head 
coach, was thankful for the level of 
leadership his seniors have provided 
all season.

“Anytime you can send the seniors 
out on a good note is just a great 
thing,” he said. “They have seen this 
program through some tough times 
and are a big reason we are doing 
so well.”

While the Tritons may have 
played their last regular-season game 
at home, they still have a chance 

to play at Triton Soccer Field for 
the CCAA championships. To do so, 
they would need to win their final 
two matches on the road at Cal State 
San Bernardino on Oct. 31 and Cal 
Poly Pomona on Nov. 2 and receive 
some help in the standings. Even 
if the CCAA tournament falls out 
of their reach the team also has an 
outside shot of making the NCAA 
Division-II tournament Dec. 4-7 at 
the University of Tampa in Florida.

tall and super powerful. [Head coach 
Pattie Pinkerton] always tells us that it 
is likely that the other schools would 
be able to out-power us, but that we 
can win by out-rowing them so we 
spend a lot of time perfecting our 
stroke to get the most power out of 
it.”

According to Hansen, the day’s 
success was a result of the rowers’ 
abilities to trust each other. 

“Our team this year is cohesive 
and unified, which is so important 
to crew because in order to push 
yourself to work harder during a race, 
you need to be able to trust that the 
girl sitting in front and behind you 
is working just as hard,” she said. 
“I’m really excited that we were able 
to reach this in the early part of the 
season, giving us the rest of the year 
to perfect it.”

The women’s novice-eight teams 
also raced against Chapman, this time 
earning second- and third-place fin-
ishes. The A boat was six seconds shy 
of Chapman’s finish at 20:23. Still, 
Pinkerton was proud of the Tritons’ 
event race, especially given how most 
colleges have head starts as semester 
schools. 

“The schools we raced against had 
been racing a lot more,” Pinkerton 
said. “For the rowers to go out and 
attack one of our early races, they did 
a terrific job. The fact that our novices 
finished very close to Chapman was 
awesome.”

Also looking strong was the men’s 
team, as the collegiate eight A and B 
teams posted times of 14:32 and 14:36, 
respectively. According to senior co-
captain Ryan Andre, the team has a 
new outlook and approach to training 
from last season. 

“Last year we rushed the begin-
ning of our season a little too much,” 
Andre said. “This year we are starting 
back at the fundamentals and working 
a lot on perfecting the simple things 
that make boats move. I think that 
mentally, we are taking a more mature 
approach to the fall season by sacrific-
ing some of our fall races in order to 
invest in being faster this spring.”

Andre said he believes that the 
team’s new dynamic will be beneficial 
this season. 

“We have an unusually hard-work-

ing group of guys this year who really 
just want to outwork each other and 
have fun doing it,” Andre said. “We 
also have a lot of depth in terms of 
maturity. We have a handful of guys 
on the team who are the kind of 
level-headed individuals that lead by 
example and are comfortable with 
being leaders. There is no pushing 
people along to do work this year; it’s 
all internal with this group.”

Indeed, spring season will be the 
most exciting time for the Triton row-
ers, presenting some exciting oppor-
tunities for both teams. For Andre, 
that excitement includes the prospect 
of competing in the national cham-
pionships, held in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif., this year. 

 “The rowing community is mak-
ing a concerted effort to include West-
Coast rowing to a more fair degree in 
the national championship this year,” 
Andre said. “As a result of that, UCSD 

has an exciting opportunity to debut 
this year at the national championship 
regatta if we perform to our poten-
tial. Rowing is the oldest collegiate 
sport, and as such has been monitored 
by the old East Coast Ivies. Yet for 
the first time this year, in over 100 
years of competition, the West Coast 
will host the national championship 
regatta.”

Last year, the women’s team expe-
rienced that honor when they placed 
second in the Grand Finals. 

“We’ve been working really hard 
on improving our technique and 
our power application for this fall,” 
Pinkerton said. “Everybody’s tech-
nique improved, and that is very 
important for crew. It looks like we 
are moving along right where we want 
to be because we want to earn a trip 
back to nationals.” 

It seems the Tritons are off to a 
solid start. 

“I’m looking forward to our spring 
season and getting to finally see our 
competition,” Hansen said. “I’m also 
looking forward to seeing the trans-
formations the other girls are going to 
have. There is something about your 
third year of rowing when everything 
just sort of clicks. I definitely felt it 
last year and since we have quite a few 
third-years this year, I can’t wait to see 
the sorts of transformations everyone 
is going to have.”
