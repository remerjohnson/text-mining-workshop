SAN FRANCISCO - The 
California State University 

. (CSU) Board of Trustees, 
angry over the growth of 
enrollment in remedial classes, 
is debating whether the 
community colleges should 
take more responsibility for 
providingJemedial education. 
During a November meeting, 
several trustees were upset to 
learn that, despite tougher 
admissions requirements, 
remedial enrollment at CSU 
grew by more than 50 percent 
during the 1980s. Almost half 
the first-year students at some 
CSU campuses enroll in 
remedial classes.

External The Dawn Of 
A.S.: Craig resigns for "personal 
and professional reasons" 
By Marianne VICII 
News Editor 

UCSDs enormous $32 million 
Recreational/Intramural Athletic Complex 

opens its doors to students today 

Jennifer Craig, the Vice President of External 
Affairs resigned Dec. 15 citing "personal and pro-
fessional reasons." Her resignation followed a re-
quest from her staff, led by Naomi Foulk, the 
Associated Students' Representative to the Uni-
versity of California Students Association (UCSA), 
that she step down. 

T HAS BEEN A LONG AND OfTEN CONTRO-

versial road, but seven years and over $30 
f/lillion after the idea was hatched by a 
small group of students, faculty and staff 

gathered to look at the poor state of campus 
athletic facilities, UCSD now boasts one of the 
premier college sports complexes in the country. 
With a weight room that is the envy of some 
profession sports teams, a cavernous 5,OOO-seat 
arena and more basketball courts than you can 
shake a stiCk at, it is hoped that RIMAC can not 
only provide an athletic outlet for the sports-
minded campus, but draw big-name concerts and 
possibly even generate some much needed school 
spirit. It will cost students plenty and its construc-
tion was e'ftremely divisive, but RIMAC is 
withQut a doubt "the best room in town." 

Craig, who was appointed to the position in 
Spring of 1994 after a controversial election, said 
that she felt her decision to resign was the best 
decision for all parties involved. 

"There was a lot of tension among the staff from 
the election," Craig said. "They weren't happy and 
I wasn't happy, but instead of wanting to work it 
through, they decided it was easier to say "we all 
don't want you here. ", Foulk and A.S. President 
Carla Tesak met with C!aig early in December and 
asked her to resign. 

Craig also said that her 20 unit courseload and 
her obligations to the United States Student Asso-
ciation (USSA) weighed heavily in her decision to 
quit the post that she held for barely a quarter. 

Craig said that her resignation, though rather 
sudden, would not be "a big deal" for the staff. 
"They'll do fine. I don't think that it will rock them 
at all...They are an excellent staff and I think this 
will be better for them and for me .. .1 don't think that 
they even really need a vice president, the staff is so 
competent," she said. 

Craig looks forward to focusing her energies on 
completing her two majors, History and Ethnic 
Studies and concentrating on her position on the 
national board of the USSA.

Tesak will oversee the staff who worked under 

Craig until a replacement can be found. Tesak said 
that although she will consider applications from 
anyone who applies, she expects the position to be 
filled by some one from within the Associated

The Guardian s Opinion . .............. . 4 Tesak felt that it was Craig's inability to mobi-lize her staff that led to her resignation. "The main 
problem was that she just didn 't work well with her 
staff. She just couldn't lead her team," Tesak said.

Scripps Medical Group Pulls Out of Merger Negotiations 
By Erik Johnson 
Staff Writer 

After four months of negotia-
tions, the Scripps Medical Group 

. ::ed out of a proposed merger 
with UCSD. The merger would have 
linked Scripps Memorial, Green 
Hospital at Scripps Clinic, UCSD's 
Thornton Hospital, and the UCSD 
Medical Center in Hillcrest, as well 
as three other Scripps hospitals in 
Chula Vista, EI Cajon, and Encinitas. 

The board of the Scripps Institu-
tionsofMedicineand Science voted 
to withdraw from the negotiations 
on Dec. 1. Although Scripps offi-
cials declined to discuss the deci-
sion, according to a Dec. 3 San Di-
ego Union-Tribune article, a well 

placed source said, "The primary 
reason is that there was too much 
administratively on Scripps' plate. 
To take on a situation associated 
with state operations, everyone was 
afraid." 

A spokesperson for UCSD Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson said that 
the chancellor was disappointed. 

In a joint statement, the medical 
institutions stated that, "Despite the 
good-faith efforts made by the ne-
gotiating teams, significant differ-
ences remain which make the for-
mation of a combined single-entity 
health-care delivery sy tern unlikely 
at this time." 

According to the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, some sources have 

speculated that the Scripps Clinic 
Medical Group, a 270-member af-
filiation of physicians that contracts 
with Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation to provide medical ser-
vices, may have acted to stall the 
talks. However, Dr. Thomas A. 
Waltz, head of the group, denied 
that the doctors were particularly 
concerned. Insiders said that the 
physicians feared the bureaucracy 
which might result from a merger 
with UCSD. 

UCSD Vice Chancellor of Re-
source Management and Planning 
John A. Woods explained that, "The 
medical organization here is incred-
ibly complex; takethat and multiply 
that by Scripps', and you can under-

stand how complicated this issue 
is." Woods added that, to som,e in-
volved, the merger was a "Iongshot" 
from the beginning. 

The proposed agreement was 
meant to respond to a changing 
health-care environme.nt featuring 
more "managed care" with insur-
ance companies as third party pay-
ers. 

Proponents of the agreement en-
visaged a consolidation of health 
care in San Diego which would 
lower the number of beds and cut 
costs by eliminating the duplication 
and further integrating medical ser-
vices.

to San Diego's 
economy. The uni-

largest employer, 
with an annual pay-

5,OOOacademicem-

In addition , 
UCSD spent $131

takes place in a classroom in a lec-

revenue received from federally sup-
• ported research and private dona-

tions has increased, revenue from 
the state continues to decrease, as 
the statewide recession continues to 
take its toll on public expellditures. 

The university ranked sixth 
among the nation's top universities 
in the amount of federal awards for 
research and development. It rated 
first among the other nine UC cam-

The report also found that the 
workload for students has increased 
over the years, with the average 
undergraduate now spending about 
16 hours per week in class. 

In addition, for every hour in 
class, it is estimated that a student 
spends another three hours on back-
up work and studying. This adds up 
to 64 hours per week, not including 
any lab time that may be required.

Professor Honored for Gene Research 
Theodore Friedmann, M.D., professor of pediatrics 

at UCSD. was recently selected for several prestigious 
honors from Oxford University in England. 

Friedmann was presented the 1994-95 Newton 
Abraham Chair in Medical, Chemical and Biological 
Sciences at Oxford. He was given a lifetime appoint-
ment as a fellow to Lincoln College at Oxford. 

These awards were presented in recognition of 
Friedmann's pioneering work in gene-therapy delivery 
methods. During the last 25 years of research, he has 
explored the ethical and SCientific challenges in the 
field of gene therapy, and has become one of the 
world's premier eKperts on the use of virus packages 
to deliver therapeutic genes to cells. 

Among his accomplishments, Friedmann was the 
first to show that genes delivered with a disarmed 
virus into defective human cells could correct human 
genetic defects associated with cancer and some 
forms of heart disease. 

Friedmann is a founding faculty members of the 
UCSD School of Medicine, and he directs UCSO's 
Gene Therapy Program.

The Real World 
Lesso.,. of RIMAe 

This is the big day - RIMAC has landed. If you have 
yet to visit the multi-million dollar athletic facility, a tour 
is definitely in order. As its doors open today for the first 
time, throngs of excited or plain curious students are sure 
to explore its 174,OOO-square-feet of recreational space. And 
most will be awestruck. Awestruck at its sheer immensity, 
its vast array of facilities, its clean and intelligent design. 
Walking through the complex, many students will be struck 
be the incredible thought which was put into every thing-
from the 44,OOO-square-foot multi-purpose Main Arena! 
Gym to the vented lockers in the men's and women's 
lockerooms. 

However, many students remain weary of the recreational 
facility. Many feel resentful that they have forced to pay 
for a complex which they will rarely, if ever, use. Many are 
cynical - and some still bitter - about how this giant 
made its way onto campus. 

And rightly so. Unfortunately, as great as RIMAC is as a 
facility, it serves as a permanent reminder of the worst side 
of UCSD. It symbolizes the triumph of tyranny over de-
mocracy, administrative rule over student autonomy. 
RIMAC's decidedly democratic design betrays its origins. 

What will not be said at RIMAC's Jan. 24 ribbon cutting 
is what the facility has meant to the administration. It was 
the students, we are told some four years later, who wanted 
the building. It was the students who controlled this, that 
and the other thing. While students work on and given a 
measure of control over RIMAC's planning, the adminis-
tration was, at all times, the engine behind the project. 
RIMAC was not the result of some miraculous outpouring 
of the collective student. conscious. It originated from the 
administration, from the desk of Vice Chancellor for Un-
dergraduate Affairs Joseph Watson, to be precise. 

UCSD was, quite frankly, a campus with woefully inad-
equate athletic facilities. Many high schools had better of-
ferings than UCSD. And athletics, proper or not, are ex-
tremely important to colleges. It helps recruitment.lt builds 
image in ways which nationally renoun science programs 
cannot. The administration knows this now, and it knew it 
in 1988, when the RIMAC planning committee met for the 
first time. 

At the ribbon cutting, Chancellor Atkinson will not men-
tion in his speech that the election rules governing the tri-
umphant RIMAC referendum were, apparently, subject to 
change at the whim of administrators whenever it fit their 
needs. That there was no consistently followed set of rules, 
much less one which met the criteria of democracy. He will 
not mention that students who filed grievances about elec-
tion misdeeds were never given a formal hearing. Atkinson 
himself sent the rubber stamp down on grievants' requests. 

laslead we will be told about how the seven years cul-
minating in the creation of RIMAC is aq incredible suc-
cess for student government, and-a historical landmark for 
UCSD. We will be told how any vote which involves insti-
tuting a fee is bound to be controversial. Instituting fees 
are controversial. RIMAC, however, did so in a visciously 
anti-democratic manner. Did administrators not expect a 
great "tea revolt?" 

But A.S. President Carla Tesak was right when she said 
that, although she disagrees with how RIMAC was brought 
to campus, students should make the most of the facility. 
She is also probably right when she said tllat the manda-
tory $70 per quarter fee is "set in stone." Short of RIMAC 
sinking into the sea, we arl: stuck with this grand, yet ex-
pensive, rec center. 

However, as we explore RIMAC's four-acre atheletic 
facility, as we use the stair master in the weight room and 
cheer to our favorite bands in the Arena, we should not 
forget the lessons of RIMAe. Because the politics at UCSD 
are, in many ways, a microcosm of the politics in the Real 
World. That just may be one of the most important things 
you learn in college.

The Pros & Cons of RIMAe 

HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES 
AND THE FETAL 'CRUSADES' 

COMMENTARY: Anti-abortion fanatics are growing in numbers at a 
. frightening pace, while their supporters 'spew religious nonsense 

By Anne V.lsm.n 
Opinion Editor 

The most recent shooting spree in the name of 

National Director of Rescue America Don Treshman 
said of the incidenl, "We're in a war. The only thing is 
that until recently Ihe casualties have only been on one 

"God" and unborn babies was Dec. 30, 
when John Salvi III killed IwO recep-
tionists at separate abortion clinics in 
Massachussetts. 

Abortion is nothing new, and nei-
ther is the debate between the all-loo-
familiar arguments of "pro-choice" 
and "pro-life." 

Aside from the when-is-a-fetus-a-
person and is-abortion-rlght disputes, 
we are increasingly confronted by an-
other question: Can we justify murder-
ing individuals in the abOrtion indus-
try, even if some of us feel that abor-
tion is wrong? 

More than ever before, fanatics are 
stepping forward to say that killing is 
not only all right, but that it is a moral 
and righteous act, so long as it is for 
the purpose of "saving" and "defend-
ing" the unborn. 

The Rev. Donald Spitz, director of 
Pro-Life Virginia, publicly thanked 
Salvi for his violence and asked in a 
megaphone-enhanced shout, "Why is 
the life of a receptionist worth more 
than the lives of 50 innocent human 
babies?" 

It is impossible to say that anyone 
life is worth more than another. Every 
life ought to be an individual concern, 
including that of the slain reception-
ists, both of whose only mistake, un-
fortunately fatal , was to choose the 
wrong building in which to answer 
phones. 

Such acts of barbarity do not save 
any fetuses. These acts only detract 
from the pro-life cause. Using sav-
agery as a lactic for "protecting" the

mind about abot'-
tlon. It doe., 
however, cause 
more people to 
view the leade,. 
and the gunmen 
of thl. "crusade" 
a. fanatical

about abortion. II does, however, cause 

side. There are 30 million dead babies 
and only five people on the other side, 
so it 's really nothing to get all excited 
aboul." 

The families and friends of the bru-
tally murdered receplionists have 
plenty to "get all excited about." They _ 
had loved ones taken away from them 
by a self-righteous religious fanatic, 
who decided that nobody will stop hav-
ing abortions unless he kills a few 
people." Salvi, like so many mad gun-
men before him, apparently had no 
idea thai the only ones who would root 
for him would be mad potential gun-
men. 

II never ocurred to these religious 
fanatics that the Ten Commandments 
listed no exceptions. When the Bible 
said, "Though shall not kill," it did not 
add, "unless you think you are right 
and your victims are nol." 

One of the scariest aspects of the 
incident is that Salvi is portrayed by 
the mass media as a fervently religious 
man. Whether he actually is or nol be-
comes a moot poinl. What matters is 
thai it causes religion itself to seem like 
the territory of extremists. It is truly 
frightening that there are many who 
have no qualms about thanking Salvi 
for his brutality in the name of Jesus, 
because he happens to call himself a 
Christian. 

Does the rest of Christianity take 
no offense to this? Amazingly enough, 
much of it does not. . 

Though many anti-abortion activ-
ists, including those who call them-
selves Christians, claim that incidenls 
such as Ihose involving Salvi are "ran-
dom acts of individuals," they never-

more people to view the leaders and the gunmen of 
Ihis so-called "crusade" as fanatical extremists. These 
criminals make the entire pro-life movement appear 

theless stand by his warped principles. Norfolk's Citi-
zens for Justice Director David Crane said, "Deadly 
force is being used.against the unborn, so people are 

vehementl y irrationa I. See FANATICS, Page 5 

Monday, January 9, 1995 

FANATICS: 
Killing in the 
name of God 
Continued from pac. 4 
now willing to use that same kind 
of force against the abortion indus-
try. " 

the~e is a clear threat from 
such militant anti-abortion activ-
ists as Salvi: Violence against 
abortion clinics will become a new 
method of protest. 

According to the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, a former Catholic 
priest sent a leiter to Congress last 
summer, which predicted "mas-
sive killing of abortionists and 
their staffs." 

The January issue of Harper's 
quotes from an anti-abortion 
manual called "The Army of 

God": "You find out that you have 
a very short time to live due to a 
terminal illness. This is a once·in-
a-lifetime opportunity. 

"Whatever activities are under-
taken (torching, bombing, thumb 
removal, etc.), carry on with reck-
less abandon!" 

The public can no longer ig-
nore these threa~ or attribute Ihem 
to "random acts of individuals." 
Anti-abortion extremis~ are more 
numerous, organized and vicious 
than ever before. 

Sadly, in their fight for the lives 
of the unborn, fanatics have no 
shame in obliterating the lives of 
anyone who stands in their way. 

This is not a crusade to save 
lives - it is terrorism. Regardless 
of whether we believe abortion is 
righl or wrong, we must treat these 
criminals as just that - criminals.

a naturalized citizen of the United 
States, I opposed Proposition 187 
because iI would deny dignity to fel -
low human beings . It would 
criminalize one's efforts to survive, 
one's desire to support his family, 
one's hope for a better life. 

Might does not make right, and 
majority is not a substitute for mo-
rality. While we would fly half-way 
around the world 10 feed the hungry 
and protect the weak, the majority of 
us chose to deny the same courtesy 
to those living among us. Though 
fleming claims Ihat "we will all sleep 
a little better, knowing that it isn't OK 
to break into our country any more," 
these are causes enough to Irouble 
my sleep for a long time.

UCSD Disputes RlMAC Repair Bill 
By Doc AI.under 
Senior Staff Writer 

Since discovering that soil be-
neath UCSD's new $32 million 
Recreational/Intramural Athletic 
Complex (RIMAC) foundation was 
sinking last summer, the university 
and the bead contractor have been 
engaged in a dispute over who will 
pay for repairing the damage. 

The repairs, which were com-
pleted last October, are estimated to 
cost between $250,000 and 
$500,000, according to Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Facilities De-
sign and Construction Boone 
Hellmann. 

According to Hellmann, soil be-
neath RlMAC's foundation sank be-
tween two to six inches in a "fairly 
localized area" near the Main Gym/ 
Arena and racquetball courts, re-
sulting in broken water pipes. 

The university maintains that the 
problem stems from "defective con-
struction" on the part of Moran Con-
struction Company, the head con-
tractor for RIMAC, and has denied 
liability for the repair costs. Ac-
cording to Hellman, three recent 
geological surveys have been con-
ducted and all concluded that Moran 
improperly compacted the soil. 

"The consensus on the reports 
was that there was no question that 
there has been a lack of compaction 
in the soil that was placed," Hellman 
said. He added, however, that ear-
lier tests indicated that soil was suf-
ficiently compacted. 

According to Hellmann, Moran 
may have tried to compact too much 
soil at once, an action which would 

[ 
Hou •• KEEPING 

teneral housekeeping duties, 
assist with rool setups, pick 
up trash, clean restrocls and 

operate equip.ent (vacuuI, 
washer, etc). 

........ ,..,HU.' 

have compacted the top few inches, 
but left the bottom soil unprepared 
for the construction, 

Under. these conditions, said 
Hellmann, "When the little guy 
comes in to do his test hole and do 
his compaction reports, it 's entirely 
possible that his test report would 
come out okay." 

Moran's RlMAC Project Man-
ager Jerry Thomas declined to com-
ment on the dispute, but in an Oct. 3 
letter from Moran Construction to 
UCSD Director of Architecture and 
Project Management R6bert 
Wielage obtained by the Guardian, 
Moran Construction denies the 
university's charge of "defective 
construction. " . 

"We are disappointed in the 
university's position regarding this 
problem," the letter states. "The uni-
versity included the CONCEALED 
OR UNKNOWN CONDITIONS 

clause in the specifications in order 
to obtain a lower bid price .... Now 
that it is likely that a concealed or 
unknown condition has occurred, the 
university is attempting to shift the 
liability covered by thiscIause to the 
contractor .... " Weilage was also un-
available for comment. 

Contractually, Moran Construc-
tion must file a claim with the uni-
versity to recoup repair costs. If 
Moran files a claim and the univer-
sity denies it, Moran may opt for 
arbitration or litigation. 

Moran has not yet filed a claim 
with tbe university. 

Assistant Vice-Chancellor of 
Student Programs and Facilities 
Tom Tucker said that litigation is a 
possible outcome. "Obviously, the 
Student Affairs' agenda, along with 
[Facilities Design and Construction], 
is to make sure that we protect the 
student dollar," he added.

The most heralded aspect of RIMAC, the 
44,OOO-square.-foot Main Gym/Arena occupies 
the first level. The Main Gym/Arena can serve 
either as an arena for sporting and programming 
events, with a near-5,()()(}person capacity; or as 
a gym, with five ful~sized side-by-side basketball 
courts. Bleachers fold in and out from the north-
em, eastem and westem walls to give the space 
maximum flexibility. When all of the bleachers 
are fully extended, one basketball court - or 
stage area - is left in the center. When they are 
retracted, the five courts are available for recre-
ational and training use.' 

Given that the Main Gym/Arena is likely to be 
used extensively as a concert venue, planners 
were careful to assure that it was designed for 
the best possible acoustics. Strategically placed 
sound panels are found on all four walls as well 
as the ceiling. 

In addition, a catwalk system, which tours 45 
feet over the gym floor, will be used for controlling 
and setting up additional lighting equipment.

For sports and programming events, crowds 

will use the arena entrance on the second level, 
which Includes a five-window box office and a 
lobby. A 'top-loaded' facility, doors from the lobby 
lead to the concourse walkway, which runs along 
the periphery of the Main Gym/Arena, where 
audiences will walk down to their seating. 

An outdoor patio on the northem side of the 
level may be used as a place for concert~oers to 
smoke (RIMAC- is a nOll-smoking facility) and 
merchandisers to sell T-shirts and other Items. 
Two concession stands, one on either side of the 
doors opening to the patiO area, will also be used 
during events. 

Eight racquetball and two squash courts, 
each with a glass wall so people can observe 
play during tournaments, are located. jn the 
western-half of the second level. Bench seating 
faces six courts. An equipment check-out room 
is adjacent to the courts, where racquets, 
racquetballs, basketballs, and volleyballs are 
available to students. 

The m€:n's and women's locker rooms, which 
include day-use lockers, showers and rest rooms, 
are also located-on the second level. 

Built on a hill, RIMAC's main entrance and 
lobby is on the third level. The lobby features a 
high ceiling and, surrounded by large windows, 
an abundance of natural light. Students must 
show their validated 10 cards at a counter at the 
far end of the lobby. 

The 12,OOO-square-foot weight room, which 
is said to be the largest such college facility on 
the West Coast and features 'state-of·the-art' 
free weights, weight machines and cardiovascu-
lar equipment, is located on the third level. 

In addition, the third level features a two-court 
auxiliary gym for basketball, volleyball and soc-
cer, and three activity rooms, one outfitted for 
dance programs and another for martial arts. 

At the eastern end of the level, a glass-
enclosed 'skybox,' overlooking the Arena, can 
house additional sound and lighting equipment.

RECREATIONALIINTRAMURAL ATHLETIC COMPLEX 

STORY BY DOUG ALEXANDER, SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

A ITER SEVEN YEARS OF PLANNING and co. Nstruction - and bitter political con-troversy - RIMAC, the $32 million Recre-ation/Intramural and Athletic Center, offi-
cially opens its doors to UCSD students 

today, one quarter later than initially anticipaie. 

Sports-minded students and faculty, as well as oth-
ers, have long complained that UCSD's recreational 
facilities - a conglomerate of buildings scaltered 
throughout campus, which includes the Main Gym, 
Canyonview and Spantls- are outdated and inadequate 
for the .campus's needs. 

" You walk into the MainGym and it 
seems like a high school gym," Gannon 
said. "All of that changes Wednesday 
night [when the men's basketball team 
plays its first game at RIMAC]. Now 
we're playing in the best room in town, 
and the best room in the country." 

Touted as one-ofthe largest and most 
comprehensive athletic complexes on 
the West Coast, the enormous 188,000-
square-foot structure straddles the hill-
side between the Super Computer Cen-
ter and North Campus Recreational 
Fields, stretching from one to four lev-
els at opposite ends. RIMAC houses a 
multitude of facilities, including con-
ference rooms, multi-use activity rooms, 
racquetball and squash courts, a weight 
room, a two-court auxiliary gym for "RIMAC will 

Head Women's Bal'ketball Coach 
Judy Malone, w~ose team is playing 
the first game ever at RIMAC on Mon-

opportunity to play in there. Everybody 
on campus can use RIMAC, unlike the 
old gym, where students could get in 

basketball, volleyball and indoor soc-
cer, and a large, 5,OOO-seat arena, which 
will serve as a venue for both athletic 
and programming events. In addition,

Designed by the Los Angeles-based 
firm Parking Architects, which special-
izes in athletic facilities and designed 
both UCLA's John Wooden Center and 
University of Arizona's Student Recre· 
ation Center, RIMAC was conceived 
and built as a "multi-use" complex,

there." '. 

" I give the facility an enthusiastic thumbs up. RIMAC 
will serve as the prototype recreational facilities for 
years to come," said Assistant Vice Chancellor of Stu-

- everything from martial arts to high-speed indoor 
soccer - and the needs of everyone from UCSO team

U CSD STUDENT FEES jumped $70 this quar-ter, the result of a deci-sion made by students 
who are no longer here 

and administrators most students 
will never meet. 

As UCSD administrators would 
have it, RIMAC stands as both one 
of the premier sports facilities in the 
country and as a model of student 
decision-making and planning. But 
UCLA student leaders saw things 
quite differently when they recently 
debated a new student facility fee on 
their campus, according to former 
UCSD student and anti-RIMAC 
activist James Field. 

These students fea red that they 
would get "RIMAC-ed." In other 
words, according to Field, RIMAC 
stands as a monument to the ma-
nipulation of student control, one 
that resulted in a 27-yea r, $170 mil-
lion commitment on the part of slu-

ended. 
I.n the four years since the 

RIMAe referendum passed, the fl-
cility fee has been challenged at 
every level of the UC system, in the 
California Legislature and in the 
courts. 

RIMAC had its genesis in a com-
mittee made up of students, faculty 
and administrators which mel in 
1988 to examine UCSD's overex-
tended sports facilities. After a com-
prehensivesurvey of 4,000 students, 
the committee laid plans for a huge 
new recreational and events com-
plex. 

From the beginning, according 
10 Assistant Vice Chancellor of Stu-
dent Programs and Facilities Tom 
Tucker, "every decision about size 
and scope of the facility was made 
by the student members of the com-
mittee." Faculty and staff were not 
allowed to vote. 

In February 1990, students were

14 FEATURES 

INSIDE: The 
Arena is the crown 
jewel of RIMAe 
Continued from ...,. 11 
existing facilities at the Main Gym, 
Spanos and Canyonview, is one of 
the most anticipated facilities at 
RIMAC, according to its staff mem-
bers. 

Featuring six full sets of free 
weights, a plethora ofweight ma-
chines and a wide variety of cardio-
vascular equipment, Sports Facili-
ties Director Don Chadwick, said 
that it is the largest such facility on 
the West Coast. 

"We're challenging people to 
identify a facility which has a bigger 
weight room," he said. 

The weight room is broken into 
two main areas: At its center is a 
sunlten area which recreation classes 
and i nter-collegiate athletic teams 
can reserve for training, while the 
area surrounding it is always open 
for general use. Each of the ma-
chines at the center of the room are 
duplicated around the periphery. 

In planning the weight room, 
Chadwick said, the Building Advi-
sory Committee (BAC) looked at 
the top six equipment manufactures 

and selected "the best of the best." 
"[There's] well over $600,000 

for the equipment in this mom, and 
its really state-of-the-art," he said. 

Before students are allowed to 
use the equipment, however, they 
are required to participate in a 15-
minute training session, which 
Chadwick said will help reduce in-
juries. Sessions will be offered on a 
"very regular basis," he added. 

In addition to the weight room, 
RIMAC offers students thousands 
of square feet of recreational sports 
space. Each of these faci lities - the 
Auxiliary Gym, activity rooms, rac-
quetball and squash courts, and the 
Main Gym/Arena - feature "sus-
pended" maple wood floors. Sus-
pendedfloors-or"spring-Ioaded," 
as they are sometimes called -are 
built on top of closely spaced rubber 
cones, which "gives a little bit of' 
spring to the step, improves the play 
and also reduces the injuries," 
Chadwick said. 

The two-court Auxiliary Gym, 
the largest rec space next to the 
Main Gym/Arena, w.ill be used pri-
marily for basketball, volleyball and 
indoor soccer. A 'curtain' can be 
lowered from the ceiling to divide 
the gym, so two games can be played 
without interference . . 

. '1.' 'I"'" , ... 
The' (]CSD' G'uardian 

RIMAC also features three 
smaller mUlti-purpose facilities, or 
activity rooms. Activity Room One 
is specifically outfitted for dance-
related programs, with inirrors and 
dance bars on two walls, and a built-
in sound system for Jazzercise 
aerobics. Activity Room Two is 
geared toward martial arts, with red 
padding on the walls and clips on 
the ceiling from which punching 
bags can hang. Both feature views 
of the athletic field. 

The eight racquetball and two 
squash courts, as well as the men's 
and women's locker rooms, are lo-
cated on the western side of the 
second, or concourse, level. Each 
racquetball court is enclosed by a 
large glass outer wall, and bench 
seating faces six of the courts. Rac-
quetball and squash courts can be 
reserved either at the site or by tele-
phone, and equipment such as rack-
ets, racquetballs, basketballs and 
volleyballs can also be checked out. All Areu fer .... M.,.

While students, staff and admin-
istrators who are involved with ath-
letics-or the planning ofthe project 
-say they are excited about RIMAC, 
the question remains as to whether 
the average student is equall y en-
thused. Will they actually use the 
facility? Will RIMAC draw larger 
crowds to UCSD sporting events? 
Will it bring students together? 

Coaches and team members are 
hopeful. "RIMAC will expose more 
students to athletics," said Doug Dan-
nevik, head coach of men 's and 
women 's volleyball, adding that in-
terest in the facility itself will bring a 
greater number of students to games. 

"I really think that it's going to, 
hopefully, really help not even boost 
school spirit, [but) maybe create 
some, because I think we are at zero," 
A.S. President Carla Tesak said. 

A.S. Director of Operations and 
Services Wally Lockwood, who 
served as the last student co-chair on 
the BAC, said that he doubted that 
RIMAC would bring the campus to-
gether, but added that could serve as 
a haven for sports-minded students. 

Both Tesak and Lockwood said 
they thought the events upect of • 
RIMAC will be more important ~o 
the student body as a whole. 

Tesak said that the arena will 
enable A.S. Programming to bring 
bigger names to UCSD, which will 
draw larger crowds and make it 
easier for it to recoup costs. Of the 
A.S. events scheduled for RIMAC, 
Tesak said that the annual Winterfest 
is slated for March and may feature 
multi-Grammy nominee Sheryl 
Crow. Lockwood said that Boingo 
may also be coming to UCSD. 

Although Tesak calls RIMAC 
"amazing," she added that she does 
not agree with the politics behind it. 
"I think the students harbor resent-
ment," Tesak said. 

Tucker, however, downplays the 
long-standing controversy sur-
rounding the facility. 

"My guess is that, after a year 
from now, as nice as the building is, 
as heavily used as it will be, if you 
had the election again, it would pass 
again," he said. 

Monday, January 9, 1995 

POLmcs: 
RIMAe electorial 
proceSs questioned 
ContInued ,..... .,... 12 
extensive and strict AS. election 
bylaws by using the "Guideli Des for 
Establishment and Increase of Stu-
dent Fees," that were developed 
during the 1980& and approved by 
the UC OffICe of the President in 
late 1987. 

The reason for this, student crit-
ics contend, was the perceived need 
to find an easier way to pass student 
self-assessed fees. 

In 1986, students voted by 60 
percc.,nt in favor of a $15 quarterly 
fee to create a football program, but 
the measure failed because A.S. 

byla~s require new fees to be ap-
proved with a two-thirds majority. 

Using the special fee referenda 
guidelines, RIMAC passed despite 
winning less than 52 percent of the 
vote. 

Paul Lanning, who was the first 
student co-chair of the RI MAC com-
mittee, approved of the special elec-
tion guidelines. "The reality of get-
ting a two-thirds vote on anything 
[is that it is] next to impossible," he 
said. 

But the simple majority loop-
hole, which exists only when add-
ing on to an additional fee (in this 
case, heaving $70 on top of the 
$12.50 campus recreation fee in-
stead of creating an entirely new 
fee), exists nowhere else in the UC 
system, according to the grievances 
filed against the referendum. The 
grievance stated that "this appears 
to have been concocted by UCSD 
campus administrators ... in an at-
tempt to evade the UC systemwide 
requirement for a two-thirds affir-
mative vote to eStablish compulsory 
fees." 

• The Infamous RIMAC bro-
chure. Several weeks before the 
referendum on RIMAC, the plan-
ning committee released a flashy 
and expensive brochure explaining 
the project. The brochure was in-
tended by the committee to be neu-
tral and purely informative, but even 
some students on the committee 
admit that it probably was not. 

"I'm not sure that we necessarily 
achieved [neutrality]," said Doug 
Willen, who was involved in the 
RIMAC Committee from the first 
meeting and later served two years 
as its student co-chair. He added, 
however, that the committee did at-
tempt to be as neutral as possible.

- Tom Tuck.r 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 

Student Programs and Facilities 
It focused on Ihe poor state of 

campus recreation facilities and the 
benefits of RIMAC with very little 
discuss,ion of the costs or other nega-
tive aspects. It did not, however, 
directly take a position. 

The brochure also cost over 
$2,500 to produce, more than 10 
times what would have been allowed 
in an A.S. election. While the com-
mittee would have granted funds for 
groups who wanted to publicize ei-
ther side of the debate, no one ever 
applied for the money. 

During the actual balloting the 
brochures were also found at the 
polling sites Ind, according to Field, 
students unclear on the issues were 
directed to read the literature by 
election workers. 

Field said that he has tapes from 
six interviews with League of 
Women Voters election volunteers 
who claim to have directed students 
to the brochures, although the 
League denied that such activities 
ever took place. 

• VoUng at Canyonvlew. By 
holding a special election, separate 
from the AS. spring elections set to 
be h'eld the next quarter, the RIMAC 
Committee chose where to place 
polling stations and when to hold 
the election. One of the polling lo-
cations was next to the Canyonview 
recreation facility, a move thatcrit-
ics contend targeted those more 
likely to vote for RIMAC.

the city should pay for a new

cbllrch ... of course the choir uid 
'yea' ," &aid Field. 

Willen, however, said that a spe-
cial election was necessary to in-
. clude the graduate studenta in the 
balloting, something not possible 
through the A.S. The Canyonview 
location, he added, was just where 
the Warren College polling station 
was placed. 

Regardless, A.S. President Carla 
Tesak views the questionable use of 
a special election as one of the mOlt 
important lessons of the controversy 
because of the possibility for target-
ing specific interests. "These spe-
cial elections, I really feel that 
they're dangerous ... . They only go 
to the people who are interested [in 
the issue to begin with]," she said. 

Last year, the AS. received as-
surances from the university that all -
future fee referenda will use the 
A.S. bylaws, according to Tesak. 

• Graduate student represen-
tatIon. The GSA was opposed to 
RlMACfrom the beginning, accord-
ing to Willen. All other GSA elec-
tions are conducted by mail ballot, 
because graduate students are not 
always on campus and often away 
on research trips. The campus bal-
loting effectively "disenfranchised" 
many ofthe students, according to a 
resolution passed by the GSA call-
ing for the invalidation of the elec-
tion. Only 440 of the 2,700 graduate 
students ended up voting in the ref-
erendum. 

Willen, who served as GSA 
President for a year but was in 
favorofRIMAC, said thatthecom-
millee made considerable efforts 
to include graduate students, in-
cluding the placement of polling 
sites at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and School of Medi-
cine. 

"The Committee really went out 
of its way" to include graduate stu-
dents, he said. 

In the end, much of the dispute 
comes down to the ambiguities of 
the special election guidelines. The 
RIMAC Committee and the admin-
istration were allowed to interpret 
the election rules, something not 
possible under A.S. election bylaws. 
This became the basis for the griev-
ances which followed. 

Despitethesecomplaints, Tucker 
contends that "every decision about 
the [election] materials and every 
decision about RlMAC was made 
by the students at that time. It was 
then reviewed by the AS. elections 
committee who said 'no violation,' 
it was then reviewed by the admin-
istration .. .. That doesn't mean the 
process can ' t always be improved." 

However, the A.S. Judicial Board 
declined to assume authority over 
the RIMAC referendum, because it ' 
was not conducted under A.S. by-
laws. 

The A.S. and the GSA both in-
vestigated the RIMAC referendum,

by the university against the stu-
dents filing the case, "maybe in a 
hallway it was mentioned." 

"I would assume they were aware 
of that," he added. 

Field, who was also involved with 
the case, said that it was the 
university'S hardball tactics that 
forced them to drop the case. "It 
wasn't because we were wrong, it 
was because we couldn't afford it," 
he said. 

Field remains frustrated over the 
university's handlingofthe RIMAC 
affair. 

"They played me like a card," he 
said. 

But others disagree, and many 
administrators and students look at 
RIMAC as a triumph. That it was 
built, Lanning said, was "nothing 
short of a miracle." 

"That [committee)," he added, 
"was the most important thing I ever 
did in college." 

Coming in Two Weeks: The stu-
dent input into the planning and 
construction of RIMAe has been 
much touted by the administration. 
Just how much authority did stu-
dents have and what does RIMAe 
mean for the future of student con-
Irol over campus planning and de-
cision-maJcing?

Continued from pace 20

team? And just to add insult to 
injury, let's have them play in the 
oldest, most important bowl 
game of all time. It makes as 
much !!ense as those CK-One 
perfume commercial~. A playoff 
system is needed now, more than 
ever before. 

The ever-growing trend of 
greediness remained unchecked 
in 1994 as well. In fact, it ran 
rampant like fungus over a half-
eaten pickle-and-barbeque sauce 
sandwich. Players bickered with 
owners, lawyers fought other 
lawyers, and everyone made 
fools of themselves. 

Lost in the shuffle of the in-
creasingly business-like envi-
ronment of last year's athletiCs 
was the reason why the players 
and owners are able to field a 
team to start with: the fans. 

Lots of other things didn't 
change in 1994. Athletes still got 
in bench~learing brawls - and 
that was in local bars. Players 
stilI Jlid things they regretted, 
and writers still wrote things 
they shouldn't have. Tonya 
Harding still whined, and 
George Foreman still kicked 
everyone's butt.

Tatum and went in for the layup to 
put UCSD ahead, 23-14. 

A second Pirate timeout proved 
more effective as Southwestern 
charged back to tie the game at 35 
apiece with just over a minute to 
play in the half. After a timeout of 
its own, UCSD rallied to score the 
final four points of the stanza, and 
took a 39-35 lead into the locker 
room. 

As the second half began, the 
Tritons and Pirates traded baskets 

• until UCSD broke the game open 
with a 13-3 scoring run highlighted 
by some strong inside play from 
Karli Jungwirth. 

Jungwirth had 14 points in just 
13 minutes of action as she pro-
pelled the Tritons to a 14 point cush-
ion, 58-44, late in the second half 

The UCSD Guardian 

faced of( against Elmira 
College (NY) and came 
away with a 70-55 tri-
umph. The win came 
quickly on the heels of 
UCSD's solid title per-
formance in the UC San 
Diego Invitational from 
Dec. 28-30. 

After an opening 
round win over North 
Central (IL) by a 67-51 
score, UCSD faced off 
against the first of two 
teams in the tourney 
which had been in the 
national championships 
last year. Middlebury 
succumbed to the Tri-
ton sharpshooters by a 
63-53 tally and UCSD 
moved on to face off 
against Millikin in the 
finals. 

The contest w'ith 
Millikin was tight 
throughout and was 
knotted at 50 with half of play.

The More 
Things Change 

Everything always stays the 
same. It's true. The beginning 
of another new year has 
passed, and after reflecting 
back on the last twelve 
months, I realize now that 
nothing has really changed. 

Heck, name one new thing 
that transpired in 1994? What 
newfangled invention swept up 
the nation into a frenzy of 
fascination? What epic 
occurance changed the course 
of mankind? What endeavor . 
marked the year and shaped it 
as its own? 

Well, I guess you could say 
a few things occurred in 1994 
worth mentioning. Mter all, 
the Post Office did raise the 
price of the stamp to 32 cents. 
This was done, I suspect, in 
order to pay for the rising costs 
of ammunition or more of 
those "Next Window Please" 
signs. 

And, of course, an analysis 
of 1994 wouldn't be complete 
without discussing the 
landmark addition of the pink 
Power Ranger to the Mighty 
Morphin bunch. Throngs of 
pastel-lovers and sensitive men 
championed that move. 

But sadly folks, that was it. 
The days of Cabbage Patch 
dolls, Fruit Roll-Ups, ~nd 
combustable Space Shuttles 
are over. Those were importAnt 
turning points - fundamental 
changes, if you will. Not much 
changed in 1994, and no where 
was this more apparent than in 
the world of sports. 

For example, NFL officiat-
ing stayed constant in the past 
year. Yes, it was ugly all 
season long, and it's still ugly 
out there. A "touchdown that 
wasn't" ignited the Chargers to 
a win yesterday, and a biffed 
call on a Michael Irvin catch in 
the earlier game could also 
bave been important. 

Poor officiating boils down 
to a contradictory rules sy·stem. 
Why does an official need to 
bring out the chains for a 
crucial fourth-down measure-
ment when he spots the ball 

"'" with an approximate guess in 
the first place? Either hire full-
time officials or bring back 
instant replay, or this will 
never change. 

Another thing that didn't 
change in 1994 was the 
ludicrous bowl-selection 
process in collegiate football. 

Let's see, we've got four 
.. teams ranked one to four. Why 

don't we pit the number-two

U CSD Pillages Pirates, 83-67 
HOT START: Triton 
women's hoopsters 
raise record to 8-2 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

While most of you were home 
for the holidays enjoying mom's 
fresh-baked apple pies and indulg-
ing in hours of rest and relaxation, 
the UCSD women's basketball team 
was hard at work. 

The Tritons spent the winter hia-
tus amassing an 8-2 record and have 
been on a tear of late. 'Since a loss 
to NAIA foe Biola on Dec. 17 (82-
67), UCSD has reeled off five con-
secutive vic'tories including three 
wins in the UCSD invitational en 
route to the title. 

The ~ost recent of those five tri-
umphs came last Friday night when 
the Tritons toppled Southwestern 
University of Texas by a score of 
83-67. 

UCSD was led by a strong per-
formance from point guard Cindy 
Yamasaki who tallied 14 points, six 
steals and seven rebounds. 
Yamasaki was also hot from the 
three point arc and it was the first 
of her three long distance bombs 
that put UCSD up 9-2 and forced a 
Southwestern timeout early in the 
first half. 

The Pirates closed to within four 
points at 12-8 before the Tritons hit 
an offensive spurt which was 
capped by Amy Franzen who stole 
the ball from Southwestern's Trisha

Tritons Have Occident 
STRUGGLING: UCSD men's basketball team loses to Occi-
dental aQd Pomona Pitzer in La Jolla Classic 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

If the UCSD men's basketball team had 
been any more gracious a host at last 
weekend's La Jolla Classic Tourney, it would 
have served hors d'oeurves. 

The youthful Triton hoopsters, sporting a 
team comp'letely devoid of seniors, runned and 
gunned their way through two tough games 
- their final contests in the Main Gym - to 
lower their record to 6-9. 

During Friday's first round matchup, 
UCSD faced off with Pomona-Pitzer College 
(5-5), the eventual tournament champion. 
Despite miserable 9-30 (30%) first-half shoot-
ing, the Tritons held close at the half, 35-33. 

Derrick Quinet sealed the win for the 
Sagehens with five clutch points - two buck-
ets and a free throw - as the Triton pressure 
defense collapsed down the stretch. Even a 
late sensational reverse dunk by forward 
Kahlil Allen couldn't save UCSD from a ten-
point loss, 87-77. 

The Tritons seemed to rebound from 
Friday's debacle by jumping out to all-point 
halftime lead during Saturday'S third-place 
game versus Occidental College (7-4). 

This time, Jason Jones (14 points), Mark 
Sebek (14 points), and Allen (15 points) led 
a consistent UCSD charge. But the Tritons 
self-destructed late in the second half with 
21 turnovers and paltry 1-12 (8.3%) three-
point shooting.

Center Matt Aune had a breakout perfor-
mance for UCSD, tossing in 18 points and 
grabbing 10 rebounds, but his team couldn 't 
hold on at the end. 

Occidental finished off UCSD by scoring 
four consecutive layups during a 8-1 run, to 
close out the score at 92-80.
