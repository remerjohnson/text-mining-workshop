Serious objections have been raised in the last 
few yeal's to the Regents' priorities in ~andling their 
investment portfolio. The central question is 
whether the Regents should take any action against 
socially irresponsible corporations in which they 
have invested. 

Thirty-two percent of the 
portfolio "is held In firms which 

. operate, receive large profits 
from, and economically sup-
port, racist-ruled South Africa." 

The precise nature of the issue can be made clear 
by a specific example. In a study published in 
March of 1973, John C. Harrington analyzed UC 
investments in corporations which operate in South 
Africa . He state that the government of South 
Africa "with the economic support of U .S. 
multinational corporations, p rpetuates apartheid, 
the internationally recognized form of institutional 
racism ." He went on to say that thirty-two percent 
of the UC investment portfolio (which totals over 
one billion dollars) "I held in firms which operate, 
receiv large profits from, and conomically 
support, raclst-rul d South Africa." 

The six largest Investments of th University, 
Harrington said, are in orporations "that have 
gained great promln nc In outh Africa", aiding 
"her In thE' quest for greater onomlc growth and 
in h r program of increased apltalization ." Th SIX 
Investm nts were in the following corporations. 
Firms Investment (Market Value) 
IBM $31,403,120 
General Motors 30,626,702 
General Electric 13,110,874 
Caltex 11 ,955,835 
Ford 11,784,125 
ITT 9,327,619 

Harrington went on to outline the ways In which 
these corporations provided onomic and 
technological assistance to the outh African 
government . 

The entral issuE' which Harrington and others 
have raised is whether the university should use its 
leverage to influence these and oth r corporations 
to act in a socially responsible manner. Much of 
this leverage derives from the large blocks of voting 
stock which would give the University of California 
a significant say In the policies of the corporation. 

The record of the University in voting on im-
portant resolutions in the past indicates the attitudE': 
which prevails among the Regents. To cite a few 
examples of UC votes (published in th l.A. Times, 
Feb. 4, 1974) : 

- 142,000 shares of convertible preferred stock 
against a proposal that International Telephone & 
Telegraph be politically non-partisan. 

- 80,000 shares of IBM, UC's largest singl 
holding, against disclosure of wages paid to black 
and white employees in South Africa . 

- 129,000 ,hares of General Motors Corp. stock 
against disclosure of the firm's involvement with 
the South African government. 

- Imilar positions with respect to 394,000 shar s 
of Caterpillar Tractor and 184,000 shares of General 
Uectri 

-100,000 shares of Ford Motor Co. against a 
propo~al to require Ford to des nbe new air 
pollution control and vehicle safety measures and 
minority hiring practices . 

- 48,000 shares of the DuPont Corp. against a 
proposal that the firm not ask its employee to 
support certain political parties or candidates. 

In his view of the way UC should handle its in-
vestment portfolio Dan A. Watkins (who served as 
chairman of the Regents for two years) is typical of 
the majority of Board members. Inllo article in the 
California Journal Lawrence Miles, UCLA ~tudent 
body president, quoted Watkins as saying that, "I n 
the end it gets down to the prudent management of 
the investments of the university, with an eye to 

maximum returns .. Once we begin applying 
somebody's idea'of morality or social good, I don't 
know where we would stop." According to Watkins, 
there should be no public discussion of a cor-
poration's social responsibility as this could 
damage the corporation's financial standing. 

It is not hard to understand why the Regents have 
taken this position. At least six of the sixteen ap-
pointed members are millionaires . Frederick G. 
Dutton (one of the liberal members of the Board) 

characteriz~d the Board of Regents as "a handful of 
rich men" and "a club of millionaires" . It is worth 
noting that eight of the twenty-four r gents were 
appointed by Governor Reagan, who is well known 
for his friendly attitude to big business. One Reagan 
:tppointee, William A. Wilson, discussed the 
reasons for the appointment. " I have a good idea It 
is because we have pretty much the same political 
philosophies .. Also, we are personal friends, and 
over the years I guess he decided I think In a way 
a eptable to him." One of the most powerful 
r gents, William French Smith, is Reagan's p rsonal 
attorney Facts such as these help to xplain th 
R g nts' r cord In dealing with ocially 
irr sponsible corporations. 

I n the last few years the Regents' policy has 
ca lled forth an increasing numb r of hall nges 
Two reg nts, William Mat on Roth and William 
Coblentz, have been particularly vo iferous In their 
oPPosition to the policy of th Reg nts Roth and 
Coblentz ar both lib ral D mocrats who were 
appointed by form r Gov Edmund G Brown 

oblentz brought the ISSU of Investments and 
orporate social responsibility to th att ntlon of 

th Regents as far back as Sept 1972 He has b en 
quoted as saying that he would "raise th ISSU (of 
Inv stme nt responsibility) as v ry R g nts 
mE' ting." Roth has gone so far as to s t up his own 
Investments ommltt e, consi tlng of two reg nts, 
two students, and two faculty members. 

There remainS' the still 
of whether the 

Regents will assume a really 
active role in dealing with what 
is judged to be corporate social 
i rresponsi bility. 

question 

Another attempt to hange uc Investment policy 
wa made in October of 1973 by UC pre ident (and 

x-officio regent) Charles Hit h. Hitch's proposal , 
which was submitted to the R gents Special 
Committee on Reorganization, would have allowed 
a r gent who felt that a parti ular proxy i sue was 
"of broad public interest" or related to " matters of 
corporate so ial responsibility" to take the issue to 
an open me ting of the ommlttee on I nv stments 
Hitch also re om mended subs ribing to the In-
vestor R sponsibil,ty Re arch C nter, which

Regents

-that the Treasurer (who cast U votes at 
stockholder meetings) support resolutions whl h 
would lead to disengagement or diS losure of 
activities of corporations in South Afri a.

A Hypothetical Encounter With A Ve'ry Real Bureaucrat 

Scene: the office of Dr. P. Winchester "Frank" 
McSaltshaker, PhD., Vice-Chancellor of Affairs 
Pertaining or Relating to the histence, Per-
pretation, and Essential Nature.of the University of 
California, otherwise known as the Vice of 
APREPENUC He occupies a well furnished office 
overlooking a busy section of campus. A shiny skull ' 
and a toothy grin recline on a soft leather chair. In a 
straightbacked wooden chair there sits a reporter, 
here to receive some of the light that the universi ty 
is letting be. He stares across a vast expanse of 
polished teak, upon which scattered documents 
float like leaves upon a stagnant pond. 

The reporter clears his throat and consults his 
notes. " There is a lot of talk about the university 
continuing to grow. Some think its big enough 
already .. . how do you feel about this?" 

Dr. McSaltshaker settles back in his chair, 
harrumphs once or twice and begins talking in a 
deep gravelly voice, its depths emphasized by the 
sharp Yankee twang with which it is delivered. 
"Well, if we were larger than we now are, then we 
could do the things that larger size would permit us 
to do. As things stand, we are too small now to do 
the things we will be able to do when we are large 
enough to do those things. However, we do not 
want to get too much bigger, we just want to keep 
what we've got and make it better than it already is. 
And it's already very good. You know that we were 
the only publicly funded university In the nation to 

rated " A" for under~raduate instruction? 
"Did they talk to the students?" 

"We are ranked right up at the top because we 
are good. We started out an innovative, creative 
campus, willing to try new things, willing to take 
the risks necessary to become a Great University. 
And instruction is one of the most important roles 

BY MALCOLM A. SMITH 

of the university, along with research and public 
service, which in turn can bt' broken down into the 
first two, the role of being a community resource 
for instruction and the creation of new knowledge 
for the benefit of man . That's what a Great 
University is all about. " 

7.00es the role of public service mean that the 
university has to be subservient to other groups in 
society? Do we not currently receive large amounts 

. of money for applied research from such agencies 
as the Department of Dâ¬'fense and the AEc?" 

" No. Well. Yes. We clo get a great deal of money 
from the federal government. But most of It is for 
basic research with no practical end in sight. We 
search for pure knowledge" '. 

" Pure knowledge directed by the wishes ' of those 
who give grants?" . 

"There is no emphasis on practicality We get the 
mo'ney we get simply because we are good,w e ha've 
three Nobel laureates and the highest per capita 
membership in the National Academy of Sciences. 
We have an international reputation for our ex-
ce llence." . 

" So you see the role of the university as' that ofÂ· 
training students in a spec ial ized field?" 

"Good heavens, no! Everyone should have a 
broad liberal arts education . The arts, humanities, 
the social sciences, we need them, that's what 
makes a Creat University. That is why we have the 
humanities sequence at Revelle, so that students 
can see the great flow of human thought. 
Everybody thinks of this as a sclente school, but 
not everybody here is involv'ed in science." . 

" That's just wh~re <\11 the money. is." 
Dr. McSaltshaker lea~s ' back in his chair and 

lights a cigarette, eyeing the reporter suspiciously 
through a cloud of smoke. "That is 'a gross 
general ization that is of ho value. Â·in Â· studying the 

Editor 

situation . I. prefer to work at a more concrete level. 
We at the univerSity deal with facts, with 
knowledge for its own sake. We investigate 
wherever the search ' for truth takes us." 

"Well , I'm studying the effec ts of irradiation on 
various kinds of cells, and thus am in the pleasant 
position of !>eing able to get a grant both from the 
AmNican Cancer Society and NASA. Searching the 
Creat Unknown," M cSaltshaker murmured, his eyes 
taking on a glassy, vacant look, "we at the 
univerSity tudy truth, for its own sake." 

The room fell silent except for the creak of the 
reclining chair and the ticking of a clock . The thick 
plate Â·glass windows shut out the bustle of the street 
and admit light to brighten the pictures on the wall : 
admits the sun to shine boldly upon the thick 
carl'ets. An air conditioning system works silently 
and invisibly keeping the room at a constant 
temperature; for administrators, like computers and 
wines, must be protected from the harsh realities of 
the world . 
. The reporter Sighed, picked up his notebook and 
rose to leave. "Well , thanks for your time." 

" Sure, any time, my boy. Always glad to talk to 
students, keeps me in touch with the campus, let's 
me know what's on student's minds." 

The report~r left the office anti stepped outside 
into the milling crowd on the street. A car nearly 
ran him down, its driver intently searching for a 
parking space. The line at Financial Aids reached 
around the corner and showed not the slightest sign 
of getting shorter. 

Dr. McSaltshaker leaned back in his soft, 
cor:nfo'rtable chair and lit up a cigarette. He reached 
out with one hand and pushed a.buttofl on his desk. 

" Rosemary, could you get me some coffee?" 
" Yes, sir," said Rosemary, " right away."

What Happened To The Sixties? Letter 
to the 
Editor 

BY GREGORY S. FLETCHER 

Hey, does anyone remember the sixties? You know, the Beatles, 
long hair, drugs, Vietnam, Kent State . No? I didn't think so. 

Rex Pickett, (Triton Times, Oct. 7) has touched upon a subject that 
require~ further discussion, and not the type of ego debates we are 
used to seeing on these pages. It is imperative that we seriousJy 
consider where we have been and where we are going. The "we" IS 
intenti4>nally left vague, the reader may fill in the blank . 

Th ? arly sixties saw the emergence of a radical state of mind. 
Som,. manifestations were long hair, drugs, and blatant contempt for 
social convention . More importantly, the movement (or more 
spec l\;ically-, the n0!1"'mnVement) was marked by a powerful and 
perv,srve sense of freedom . Freedom to t:1. IJt!riment with drugs, the 
way .... ' looked, and the way we acted. We were challeJlged by our 
seerr ing destiny to explore the very outer lim its of our world . 

M~a while, with the advent of the Free Speech Movement, and the 
genefaj growing militance of college campuses throughout the world, 
we began hearing of a sma ll Southeast Asian country. We were 
somt'what accustomed to our government involving itself in the 
internal affairs of other nations: most of Europe, the Dominican 
Republic, the Bay of Pigs . But th is particularly senseless conflict 
seemed to attract our attention . Vietnam symbolized the epitome of 
the US government's domestic policy extended to its (il)logical 
conclusion. 

By th is time we hipsters were ready for a fight. Except our weapons 
were non-violent: reason, dignity, compassion . But we were out 
maneuvered, our parents ca lled the cops. Now our freaked-out heads 
were getting cracked. Clearly our attempts to appeal to America's 
reason went unheeded. The movement soon saw some of its more 

violent factions rise to notoriety and in fluence. Abandoning love and 
f.lowers, some .young people' assumed symbols of hate and bombs. 

This adoption of violent tactics Signaled the eventual end of our 
movement. "'!ot that violence is necessarily wrong, self-defen se is 
demanded of us when our lives are threatened . However, the 
irrat ional u~e of . terrori'sm can only harm its agents and ideological 
cohorts. The xtrem'e violence of militant groups not only rallied 
oppos ition to us, .but litera lly killed the movement. Thus, leaving a 
potentially ongoing process of cultural revitalization, we doomed 
ourse lves toa necessarily short-lived existence of cultural 
repudiation, whose life,span was directly related to the Vietnam War. 
The war dragged on to its anti-climactic end. We knew the war was 
wrong, eventually the majority of America came to know the war was 
wrong. The most difficult struggle was convincing the United States 
government that the war was wrong. 

The war is over, hurrah, hurrah . Now what? Now we have new 
hairstyles, turquoise jewelry, and Irish Setters-Plckett's New 
Astronaut. It is almost as If the sixties never happened. There is little 
essentially different now in the decade following the sixties than in 
the decade preceeding the sixties. 

This conglomeration of words is admittedly simplistiC and biased. 
Howevet, it is sincere and hopefully it will have stimulated further 
dialogue, I envision In my optimistic fantasies a return to the quest 
for physical and mental freedom. Maybe this time we will make it.

result IS a well-contrived display 
of overt sarcasm.

of corporations involved in Sooth 
Africa . 

-divestment of votinll stock in 
corporations which, after two 
consecutive stockholders 
meetings, do not adopt a policy 
of economic disenpllement from 
South Africa. 

--prohibit further UC in-
vestment in corporations with ties

--set up a Un'iversity In-
vestments Committee on Social 
Responsibility with represen-
tation from regents, faculty, 
students, business , and the 
"community at large , including 
minority representation" . 

Others disagree with 
Harrington's proposals , main -
taining that the University should 
take a neutral stand on proxy 
issues, either abstaining from 
voting or voting fifty percent of 
the stock for each side. One 
argument in support of this is that 
publicly owned stock (the 
University invests with public 
funds) should not be voted since 
it is impossible to determine the 
opinion of the real stockholders. 

In the Journal article Miles 
outlines some of the questions 
which have been raised in 
discussion of the issue of in-
vestment responsibility . There are 
a number of problems involved in 
the determination of whether a 
corporation is socially respon-
sible. How does one determine 
which side is right in every case? 
And how does one keep a watch 
over the activity of giant cor-
porations, with such diverse and 
extensive inf luence on the lives of 
Individuals? This last point was 
made by William French Smith, 
who stated that consideration of 
social responsibility would 
hopelessly weigh down the 
Committee on Investments. 

Another question connected 
with investment responsibility is 
whether departure from present 
policy would impair the ability of 
the university to function as a 
free institution . Miles quotes 
Business Week : " If universities 
were to use their economic power 
to try to influence corporate or 
government policy, would they 
not invite retal iatory strategies on 
the part of corporations or the 
government? That is, the

I 
It is clear that there is no 

simple solution to the problem of 
ethical standards in handling the 
UC investment portfol io. The 
relevant factors (maximum in-' 
vestment returns, moral con-
siderations, the advantages and 
disadvantages of neutrality, etc .) 
have been given different degrees 
of emphasis by the Regents and 
their opponents. 

The Regents have up to now 
emphaSized investment returns to 
the exclusion of other con-
siderations, but there are signs 
that thi s policy is being modified . 

One such sign came in March of 
1974, when the Regents voted to 
scold Goodyear Tire and Rubber 
Co. for an illegal contribution to 
Nixon's campaign . The Regents 
ordered a letter of reprimand to 
be sent to the company; it was 
the first such action Dean 
Watkins could rec,,11. 

There still remains the 
question, however, of whether 
the Regents will assume a really 
active role in dealing with what is 
judged to be corporate social 
irresponsibility. The Regents have 
many more ways to influence 
corporate policy than sending 
letters to the companies. The 
central question at this point is 
whether the Regents will take 
more serious steps in dealing with 
i rrespons i bl e corporations, or 
confine them selves to less drasti c 
measures like letters of 
reprimand .

MEMORANDUM TO JUNIOR 
AND SENIOR SCIENCE MAJORS 

Chemistry 195 is designed to give upper division students With 
strong science backgrounds an opportunity to take on a teaching 
ro le in lower division (and in a few cases upper diviSion) 
chemistry courses This program has been very successful over 
the past few years, providing mutual benefits to faculty, students 
and teaching assistants. Especially in the large courses, the 
teaching assistant forms a vital part of the faculty-student in-
terface by helping students feel more in touch and less part of an 
amorphous crowd 

Expanded enrollments and course offerings provide us With the 
chance to employ more undergraduates In the teaching program 
this year than ever before. For this reason the Department of 
Chemistry is seeking outstanding upper diviSion sc ience majors 
to participate in this program during the winter and/ or spring 
quarters of this academic year. Assignments typically Include 
conducting recitation and/ or laboratory sections (25 students) as 
well as meetings and exam grading sessions with the course 
instructor. 

In addition to obtaining course credit for teaching through 
enrollment in Chemistry 195, the're are also a limited number of 
assignments which carry a stipend of approximately $400 per 
quarter. Students with prior experience in Chemistry 195 will be 
given preference for paid positions. 

If you are interested in helping fellow undergraduates learn 
chemistry, please contact Jean Kramer at 4426 Mayer Hall (x 
3038) immediately. Please provide a record of your science 
grades We are now preparing our teach ing assignment schedule 
for winter quarter.

A lomen Finish Successful Week 
by lett Lee 

Cappinll off anÂ· outstandina 
week, the UCSD water polo 
team swam to an euy 8-3 victory 
over Whi~ier CoIIep last friday 
in the home pool. Durina their 
hectic week, the Tritons played 
five games, won them all, out-
scored their opponents 48-12, 
took the loyola Invitational 
Tournament, and improved their 
record to (1(}'1). 

The Tritons demonstrated that 
they had finally put it "all 
together" as they totally 
dominated the Whittier ron-
tingent. The first quarter ended 1-
o with Dave Dupuy putting on a 
beautiful offensive show and 
scoring the initial goal from point 
blank range . Dupuy continually 
harassed the Whittier goalie, 
barely missing several spectacular 
shots. 

I f the spectators thought the 
first quarter was good, they were 
ellen more delighted by the 
second stanza as the Tritons 
poured it on and scored five 
goals, three of the scores came in 
a period of two minutes. Â· Alan 
O'Hern and Corky Hull scored the 
goals with three and two goals 
respectively . The most impressive 
facet of the game, however, was 
the defense. The Tritons allowed 
only three shots on goal and 
continually kept the Whittier 
squad in their own end of the 
pool . The half ended with the 
Tritons on top by a score of 6{). 

At the start of the second half, 

Coach Gary Becker decided to 
give the reserves some playing 
time. The Whittier team, 
,seeminlly aroused by this move, 
assumed the offensive and finally 
scored (beina aided with a 2 man 
advantage in the pool due to 
penalties by the Tritons). 

Then Mark Liska, who is not 
exactly known for his swiftness in 
the pool, brouaht his team to life' 
with a mad sprint down the 
length of the pool with the ball, 
and only a foul by a desperate 
opponent prevented him from 
scoring . Liska was awarded a 
penalty shot, but he missed it. 
The 3rd quarter ended with the 
Tritons on top with a 6-1 score. 

I n the fourth quarter, the 
Tritons took advantage of a 
penalty situation themselves as 
they demonstrated beautiful 
cross-poo l passing . Dennis 
Thomas took an assist from 
O'Hern to make the score 7-1 on a 
long shot. After this score, the 
Whittier team "lost its cool " as 
the game degenerated somewhat 
into a game of "who can foul the 
most without getting caught." 
The referees, however, did a good 
job of keeping the game mainly in 
hand. Whittier scored two more 
goals to make it 7-3, but O'Hern 
iced the game with a nice flip 
shot into the goal to make the 
final tally 8-3. 

Earlier in the week, the Tritons 
swept all their games and cap-
tured the tournament held in L.A. 
at loyola. The first game of the 

tourney was a farce as UCSO beat 
UN las Vqas; Â»1 (this is not a 
misprint). Liska led the rout with 
4 scores. It should be noted that 
UNl V does not place too much 
emphasis on 'water sports . (This 
could be due to its geographical 
situation). 

The Tritons next took on Cal 
Tech and eliminated them 1).2, 
demonstratinll . balanced team 
scoring with Dennis Thomas 
leading the way with a hat trick 
(3 goals) . 

The final for the championship 
against Â· the host loyola con-
tingent can only be described as 
"the perfect game" as both 
squads were evenly matched 
thoughout the contest. After 
regulation time ended with the 
score 2-2, five overtimes were 
needed until a winner was 
decided. Mike Maquire scored 
the game winner in sudden death 
overtime to win {he tourney 
trophy for UCSD. 

Also, in a separate match last 
Wednesday, the Tritons beat 
Pomona-Pitzer 7-3 . This win 
marked the third consecutive win 
this year for the Tritons over 
Pomona-Pitzer . The contest was 
tied 3-3, at the end of the third 
quarter, but the Tritons were 
again able to rise to the occasion 
and score four goals in the final 
quarter. David Harry led the 
scoring with three goals. 

Next home game is this Friday, 
Oct. 25 at 4 p.m . against the 
University of Arizona . 

Aikido: Poetry in Motion 

"Now try the same motion, keeping one point 
and extending completely." To many people, 
hearing this phrase conjures visions of Masters and 

Johnson measuring some new clinical1:echnique. 
But to those who are involved in Aikido, it simply 
implies more thought and practice. 

Many people thi"k that the martial arts of self 
defense are not only for that purpose alone, but are 
also designed to render an attacker harmless by 
means of an attack itself. Aikido, however, operates 
on the philosophy that an attack should be 
neutralized and that as little physical harm take 
place as possible . The basis of the Aikido defense is 
to rotate the attack away from the body and off to 
the side. 

The Aikido Club meets five times weekly, with 
the meetings being divided into two groups as the 
increasing number of members make entire group 
gatherings an impossibility. However, if you are 
interested in joining the Aikido Club, participation 
is welcome and encouraged. The club maintains a 
non-competitive philosophy in which there are no 
beginning or advanced classes and everybody 
attempts to learn from everybody else. 

Opening Nights 
The baseball season just ended. The football season started a mere 

six weeks ago. And now we have to put up with both hockey and 
basketball. 

Aren't Hockey and Basketball winter sportsl Well supposedly they 
are, but why are they beginning the season in mid.{)ctober? 

To say the least I am not the power that deems it necessary to start 
the season of those two sports this early in the year . In fact I have no 
say regarding when the leagues begin play. 

It just so happened that the powers be, decided that last weekend 
was the one when both the Mariners (WHA) and the Conquistadors 
(ABA) were to open their home seasons . 

Needless to say I attended both the hockey game on Saturday and 
the Basketball . game on Sunday. 

The Mariners are new to San Diego . They used to be- the Jersey 
Knights, but failed miserably in Jersey. Seeking a new home, the 
Knights replaced the now defunct Gulls of the defunct WHL, as San 
Diego's major league hockey team . 

Saturday knight the"Mad, mean, menacing, major league Manners" 
mauled Marty, Mark and Daddy Howe C'f the Houston Aeros . lest you 
be reminded the Aeros won the WHA title last year, with Gordie 
(Daddy) Howe, at age 46, leading the way. 

Gordie did manage to score a goal against the Mariners, but only 
after San Diego put two men in the penalty box . Sure it's easy to score 
given all the time in the world and no one guarding you . But that was 
just about all. Houston could handle as the Mariners went on to shaft 
the Aeros, 6-2, behind the outstanding g9alwork of Joe Junkin and the 
two goal performance by Wayne Rivers. 

Sunday night the Q's opened their home season before the largest 
crowd ever to see a home game, 6875. Not too bad conSidering the 
Sports Arena holds 14,000 people. Anyway, the Q's entertained Dr. "J" 
(Julius Erving) and the ABA Champion New York Nets. ' 

Dr. "J" was all he is purported to be, at least you notice him when he 
plays . Everything he does he makes conspicuous. In fact he scored 20 
points in the first 15 minutes of the game and finished with 37 points . 

Unfortunately for the Nets a guy like Travis Grant, one who fits a 
.more classic mold as a shooter, willÂ· score 44 points with out being 
noticed, even by the opposing team . Wh ile everyone noticed the 
Doctor, not even the Nets saw Grant as he led the Q's to a 116-110 
victory. 

My apoligies over pi.cking the A's to win the series in six games in-
stead of five . I guess I just didn't realize how much better the A's are 
over the Dodgers. 

The Games People Try 
by Tom Wright 

The PUNCH & COOKI ES for 
LUNCH BUNCH is offering games 
for the " intellectually" in-
clined ... and with many such 
persons freely admitting this, 
over-crowding should be the 
only problem ... outside of the 
mind-boggling games of RIP, 
SCORE FOUR, & SQUARE OFF. 
RIP is played on a chess boardl 
with chess pieces, but the winner 

is the one who loses all his pieces 
first . Score 'Four i~ !hree-
dimensional tic-tac -toe , and 
inherant to Square Off is the 
disproval that the closest distance 
between two points is a straight 
line. 

All other game-candidates were 
ineligible because they took more 
than five minutes to play. (We 
wouldn't want you to strain 
yourself too much). 

It doesn't matter if you can't 
walk and chew gum at the same 
time .... so what if you're pigeon-
toed with a case of terminal acne, 
there's no worry, the Rellents 
won 't consider it grounds for 
dismissal and the CIA will never 
know (well maybe not never) . 

Remember, that's noon-time in
