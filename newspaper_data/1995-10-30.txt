SAN DIEGO - La Mesa 
police are continuing their 
investigation into the alleged 
rape of a Riverside County 
woman on Oct. 21 at the 
apartment of two SDSU 
football team members. As of 
last Wednesday, five players 
had been questioned, but no 
formal charges had been 
filed. In addition, no disci-
plinary action has been taken 
by the SDSU athletic 
department. According to the 
police report, the alleged 
victim, a 22-year-old female 
from Norco, CA, claimed she 
was raped by two of the five 
members of the team present 
at the apartment.

AUSTIN, Texas - Cabinet of 
College Councils officials 
announced last Wednesd~ 
that a reestablished student 
committee will work to 
eliminate a "cheating culture," 
which they say exists at the 
University of Texas. The 
Students for Academic 
Integrity Committee will seek 
to increase student awareness 
of UT's academic dishonesty 
policies. The cabinet re-
formed the group - which 
student leaders disbanded in 
1987 - after a survey 
conducted by Rutgers Univer-
sity found that more than 70 
percent of 6,000 students 
interviewed at various colleges 
admitted to some form of 
cheating as undergraduates.

ASE Wins Landmark 
Decision vs. UCSD 
UNION: Readers, tutors and 
instructors granted collective 
bargaining rights 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Associate News Editor 

After nearly three months of hearings with both 
the San Diego Association of Student Employees 
(ASE) and UC administrators, the California Pub-
lic Employment Relations Board (PERB) accorded 
UCSD readers, tutors and acting instructors the 
right to collectively bargain. 

The ruling, which could potentially affect 
over 1,000 UCSD student workers, will not 
apply to teaching assistants (TAs) and research 
assistants (RAs). 

The six-year quest for unionization ~ the 
ASE - which culminated last April in a two-
daY'''walkout'' by T As, RAs, tutors, readers and 
acting instructors - is not over, however, as 
both administrators and ASE members expect 
the university to appeal the ruling. 

In addition, T As and RAs are involved in a 
separate PERB hearing which began several

UCIrvine 
Hunger Strike 
Moves Into' 
Third Week 
LEIIER: No Retreat! members 
urge Chancellor Caserio to 
acknowledge UCI fasters 
By Suketu V.hnav 
Guardian Reporter 

Last Thursday, No Retreat! - the self-pro-
claimed, civil-rights coalition at UCSD - ap-
proached UCSD Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio with a written request urging her to 
support the First Amendment rights of five 
hunger strikers on the UCI campus. 

Four UCI students and one Claremont stu-
dent began a hunger strike on Tuesday Oct. 17 
to show their opposition to the UC Board of 
Regents' summer vote to eliminate affirmative-
action policies in the UC system. Those fasting 
are members of the group United Front, previ-
ously known as the UCI Affirmative-Action 
Coalition. 

Thursday morning, a group of20 No Retreat! 
members presented Chancellor Caserio with a 
written request asking her to relate to UCI Chan-
cellor Laurel Wilkening UCSD'sconcem about 
the hunger strike. 

Although group members were unable to 
speak dtrectly with Chancellor Caserio Thurs-
day morning, she issued a statement later in the 
day calling for fasters to end their hunger strike. 

"I strongly believe it is in the best interests of 
all parties that the [UCI hunger strikers] honor 
their agreement to end the strike on Oct. 27," 
Caserio said. 

No Retreat! members also publicly urged 
Chancellor Wilkening to recognize the-severity 
of the hunger strike and allow the students to 
remain in their camp outside the administration 
building. Before the protest began, United Front 
members signed a 10-day contract with school 
officials allowing them to stay in their present 
location. 

Although UCI school officials had warned 
fasters that they would be evicted from their 
"solidarity camp" by midnight last Friday, no 
attempt was made to forcibly remove them from 
the campus. 

The United Front members participating in 
the hunger strike declared that they would not 
stop their fast until the regents met the group 's 
demands.

Guardian Reporters 

Professors from across the na-
tion visited UCSD on Oct. 27 and 28 
to participate in a forum entitled 
"Race, IQ and Higher Education," a 
conference designed to examine the 
future of university affirmative-ac-

tion programs and UC admissions 
policies. 

The forum, sponsored by 
UCSD's Center for the Study of 
Race and Ethnicity and the ethnic 
stud.ies department, focused on the 
eligibility of Latino and black stu-
dents in the UC system, and the rate 
at which those groups are enrolling 
in its nine campU5CS. 

"The purpose [of the conference] 
was primarily to bring together the 
administration, faculty and staff to 
discuss the future of UC policies 

towards admissions," conference 
organizer and UCSD ethnic studies 
Professor Ramon Guti~rrez said. 

"[The conference] was to help 
inform people of the limitations of 
the regents' policies and to consider 
how to proceed given the constraints 
of their policies," he added.

the UC Humanities Center and the 
forum 's opening speaker, spoke on

Funk Legend Rocks 
Price Center Plaza 
TGIF: Schtum and J ambay open for Bootsy 
Collins and his Rubberband on Friday night 
By Ellubeth Hu .... 
Gusrdlan Reporter 

Following six months of prepa-
ration and planning, the A.S. kicked 
off UCSD's third TGIF of the year 
last Friday, as Bootsy Collins and 
his Rubberband,Jambay and Schtum 
entertained approximately 1,500stu-
dents at the Price Center plaza. 

Ranging from funk to punk, the 
bands performed for almost four 
hours, while some students sipped 
Henry Weinhardt beers inside the 
nearby, fenced-in beer garden -
situated on the Library Walk. 

"It was very hard to prepare for 
this event, because (Bootsy Collins 
and his Rubberband) is a major-
level band," said A.S. Programming 
Director Kevin Moo. "We were 
originally planning to have Jambay 
headline, and Bootsy Collins just 
kind of fell into our laps. " 

Jambay, a band comprised of 
former UCSD students, ended up p1ay-

ing second in Friday's line-up - pre-
ceding Bootsy Collins - while 
Schtum opened the festivities. 

"In the funk world, Bootsy 
Collins is a living legend. He is one 
of those guys who laid the ground-
work for funk back in the late 19605," 
Moo added. 

The concert's only hitch came 
near the end ofBootsy Collins' set, 
when a power problem caused a 
delay in the show. Because of the 
technical difficulties, the band had 
to finish 20 minutes earlier than 
originally planned. 

"BootsyCollins' [bandmembers) 
usually do a sound check, but they 
arrived late ... Subsequently, they 
were not able to sound check before 
the concert started," Moo said. 

But despite the problems, sev-
eral students, including Muir fresh-
man Joseph Rotondo, said the band's 
recovery following the delay added

PINION 
Racism Not the Main Problem 

By Derek Villi Hoften 
As.sociate Opinion Editor 

While the UC re-gents endure I constant bom-
bardment of com-

plaints and accusations from 
their students, one particular 
charge has recently become the 
most popular: the need for di-
versity. 

The death of affirmative ac-
lion on campuses, along with 
its impending demise in Cali-
fornia as a whole, has raised 
students' protests-as well as 
their claims that diversity is 
paramount to a complete edu-
cation. Certainly, some UC 

schools - UCSD in particular 
- suffer from a lack of diver-
sity. But the problem stops 
there. Most UCs are already 
sufficiently diverse, and the 
entire issue of diversity itself 
hIS been overemphasized, un-
fairly taking over the list of 
educational priorities in Cali-
fornia . 

To begin, one must clarify 
not only the definition of diver-
sity but also its influence on 
education and saciety. Diver-
sity is most often defined as a 
fair and equal representation of 
races, cultures, religions and 
histories. Students frequently 
throw out demands for "cul-
tural interaction" and "racial 

understanding." However, an 
analysis reveals that "diver-
sity" entails far more than 
simple representation. 

This issue cannot be solved 
by simply importing the proper 
amount of each race to UCSD. 
Those fighting for diversity 
cite the gross misrepresenta-
tion of race on this campus as 
a need for reform. They main-
tain that fixing the racial com-
position will remedy the prob-
lem. However, this is not true. 

In the first place, most 
people completely misunder-
stand the root causes of 
UCSD's lack of diversity. They 
argue that the discrepancy il-
lustrates the institutional rac-
ism existing in society, and that 
minorities are kept out of the 
university due to a conscious 
effort on the part of the regents. 

A more comprehensive 
analysis shows that this lack of 
diversity resulted from decades 
of social change - countless 
cultural changes which began 
in what was a deeply racist 
country. But racist beginnings 
do not guarantee that the mod-

. ern institutions are racist as 
well. During and after the Re-
construction period, blacks, for 
example, were shunned from 
society and denied the oppor-
tunity to succeed. They wound

Campus Needs More Variety 
By Jane Taylor 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

UCSD lacks diversity. The word "diversity" is com-monly linked with ethnic issues, but here it also 
refers to education, student hous-
ing, drinking laws and social life. 

Ethnic origi.n is the most im-
mediately visible of the different 
categories of diversity mentioned 
above - and arguably the most 
controversial. One positive sta-
tistic which adds to the illusion 
of diversity at UCSD is that 
nearly 50 percent of the students 

are people of color. After break-
ing down this ovenll figure into 
25 percent Asian, Filipino and 
Easllndian, 12 percent of Latino 
origin, almost one-percent Native 
American and 2.5 percent of Af-
rican descent, the ovenll impres-
sion is still one of multi-ethnicity. 

However, we must consider 
whether the number of students 
within each ethnic group repre-
sents the American population IS 

~ whole. The biggest discrepancy 
IS the representation of African 
Americans. Nationally, African 
Americans compriae 12.7 percent 
of the population. This figure is 

considenbly less in California~ 
at 6. 7 percent. Yet the percentage 
on campus is a remarka~ly low 
2.5 percent. These statistics show 
that higher education is not 
equally accessible for all nces; 
and they reflect the economic 
implications of education, sug-
gesting that background and class 
still have a huge effect on scho-
lastic opportunities. 

Rafael Vincente, a professor 
of ethnic history at UCSD, be-
lieves Ihat the changes in affir-
mative-action policies will have 
implications on the ethnic char-

COMMENTARY: The United States must put aside its irrational fears about Bosnia 
becoming another Vietnam, and must fulfill its humanitarian impulse by sending troops to the Balkans 

IT'S TIME TO INTERVENE IN BOSNIA 
By Mathew Fltzclbbona 
Contrlbutlnl Opinion Writer 

As the war in Bosnia continues, 
new ideas have developed nation-
wide aboulthe United States' fu-
ture role in the Balkans. While 
President Bill Clinton believes we 
should send in ground troops to 
help enforce peace, Congress is 
wary of this plan, due to the lin-
gering horrors of Vietnam. This 
nation, however, musl not hide 
behind the idea that "Bosnia is an-
other Vietnam" - it must deploy 
the military to fulfill its role as a 
world political leader, a military 
superpower and a country with hu-
manitarian inlerests. 

The United States is a role 
model for the world. Whether we 
like it or not, it is imperative that 
this nation set a standard worthy 
of being followed. Returning to 
the isolationist philosophies of the 
19205 would be counterproductive 
and just plain ignorant. We can-
not live in a single-nation environ-
ment when our communications 
and economic policies are global. 

It is now time to realize that our 
politics must be global as well. If 
we send our peace-keepers to 
Bosnia, we would be making a po-
litical statement: The United 

States is a nation of globally 
minded citizens. We are willing 10 
offer aid - not out of greed or the 
pursuit of some agenda to crush 
our enemies - but because we 
value human life. 

The United States is the coun-
try best suited for enforcing a 
Bosnia peace plan. Because of the 
inherent strength of our military, 
we would risk little in pursuing 
humanitarian goals in Bosnia. 
Sending no more than a few thou-
sand troops to this area would 
drastically limit the number of se-
vere casualties. To demonstrate 
that there will be no opportunity 
for escalation as there was in Viet-
nam, Clinton has outlined plans 
for bringing most of the peace-
keepers back home "within 
months, not years," with only a 
few hundred soldiers left behind 
for long-term service. 

In addition, the peace-keepers 
would not likely see any action. 
They would serve mainly as a de-
terrent to increased violence in the 
area. All these measures prove that 
the advantages to sending soldiers 
to Bosnia clearly outweigh any po-
tential negatives. 

But along these same lines, our 
own humanity should also compel

apart the former Yugoslavia, guar-
anteeing basic human rights to the 

ravaged countrymen. Opponents 
to this stance may argue: "The 
Balkans could easily turn into an-
other Vietnam" or "Those people 
are not vital to our national inter-
ests." 

It seems that every time the 
United States gears itself toward 
military action of any kind, some 
provincial mind starts in wilh tired 
mantras. Ralph Waldo Emerson 
wrote, "a foolish consistency is the 
hobgoblin of lillie minds" - those 
hobgoblins live. in perpetual fear 
that any military action by the 
United States will inevitably lead 
to "another Vietnam." 

In fact, the reasons for fighting 
in Bosnia are completely different 
than they were for Southeast Asia. 
There, the United Stales was fight-
ing against an ideal: the imaginary 
threal of communism. The domino 
theory - a now-ridiculed notion 
that if we weren't victorious in 
Vietnam all countries would fall 
to communism like dominoes -
so encapsulated the American 
mind, (at least in the beginning of 
the conflict), that very few people 
could see that the country was a 
lost cause. 

Those who criticize Bosnian 
intervention are perhaps overlook-

ing the fact that America's goal in 
Vietnam is very different from its 
goal in Bosnia. The truth of Ihe 
mailer is that we would not be 
fighting anybody in Bosnia - not 
the Serbs or the Croats - no one. 
Nor would we be fighting an ideal, 
such as we did in Vietnam. 

Unlike the 1970s military fi-
asco, Clinton has a clear stralegy 
for Bosnia, However, as a coun-
try, we must stop wavering and 
choose a side to defend. America 's 
involvement in Bosnia has been 
prevented, to this point, by at-
tempts to score political points 
with Russia. No action has been 
taken, in part, because Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and the 
United Nations do not support the 
same sides. There are two compet-
ing interests for the United States 
to deal with, and it has thus far re-
sulted in a stalemate. 

According to political scientist 
Ron Henry, "the premise of West-
ern diplomacy [has been] aston-
ishingly naive: A Solomonic com-

both sides [United States and Rus-

CHE FAILS TO LIVE UP 10 Irs OWN IDEALS 
Editor: 

Over two years ago, lied an ef-
fort to transform the Ch~ Cafi 
from a narrowly focused and 
poorly run vegetarian "collective" 
into a real collective that included 
outreach to the homeless commu-
nity. It seemed to me that the sur-
vival of the Chi Cafi depended 
upon a certain amount of fidelity 
to the Memorandum of Under-
standing (MoU), as well as to a 
certain amount of effort on the part 
of the core members - to mature 
beyond the idea of "revolution" as 
a fashion statement to something 
more substantive. 

It soon became apparent that 
the collective membership, when 
given the choice, had no real in-

. terest in doing anything substan-
tive. My effort to transform the 
Chi Cafi from within promptly 
got me booted from the collective 
- it seemed that my "personality" 
wasn't in sync with the majority. 
Rather, my criticisms fed a healthy 
persecution co,mplex, the frequent 
refuge of revolutionary dilettantes 
with no original ideas of their own. 
Instead of confronting the sub-
stance of my criticism, they chose

Case in point: According to the 
Foreign Press Daily Bulletin, an 

to suggest that I was trying to 
"take over" the Chi. 

Confronted with such intellec-
tual poverty from the so-called 
campus left-wing, I chose to take 
my ideas elsewhere. The core of 
those ideas became a reality in the 
form of a charity called Food for 
Thought - a charity which col-
lects over $1 million worth offood 
annually for ·the homeless and 
boasts over 100 UCSD students in 
its organization. We have the stu-
dents going out to assist the home-
less four times a week. Over 80 
San Diego businesses donate food 
to the charity. 

Last year, the charity helped 
run a homeless shelter in San Di-
ego at no cost. Next year, we are 
opening a gymnasium for the 
homeless, the first donation com-
ing from the Sporting Club at 
Aventine this Wednesday in a na-
tional press conference. We are 
currently featured in the Novem-
ber issue of "Runner's World" 
magazine for our development of 
a homeless running team, a group 
of homeless runners participating 
in local races. What former

Is it any wonder that the Chi Caf~ 
would prefer I financial review to 
a more thorough audit, one that 
would expose the improprieties 
which have occurred over the last 
two years? 

UCSD students deserve to 
know the truth about the Chi Caf~. 
At the same time, the A.S. has a

protect student interests by bring-

duct at the Chi - misconduct 
which wouldo't exist if more ma-

dents had the opportunity to run 
this valuable asset that has been 
squandered by the "student left

At the next Chi Caf~ AII-We-

I hope some of the Guardian's 
readers will notice that several stu-
dents at UC Irvine are dying at this 
moment. No mailer what cause 
they stand for, it is a tragedy for 
all students, faculty and staff when 
members of our academic commu-
nity see their options limited to 
measures as drastic as a hunger 
strike to reinstate affirmative ac-
tion in the UC system. 

However, I am amazed that 
many college papers have hardly 
covered the efforts of these stu-
dents. I hope that this situation 
will be rectified. 

If student papers cannot sub-
stantially improve the reporting of 
events in the UC system to their 
community, then we are no beller 
than the other forms of media and 
their coverage of the University of 
California.

stituation to continue. 

By not sending troops to 
Bosnia, we are perpetuating geno-
cide. Sending our peace-keepers, 
on tbe other hand, can ensure an 
end to thOle horrors and can re-
store basic human rights to the 
war-torn land.

ROOTS: Diversity

education at UCSD 
ContInued from ..... 4 
up living in ghett(ls and receiving no atten-
Jion from the government, while the rest of 
the country improved and modernized. This 
process helps explain why so many blacks 
presently live in poor cities and have lim-
ited economic opportunities. 

At this point, however, minorities ' fail -
ure to gain entry into top universities like 
UCSD stems not from direct prevention on 
the part of the regents or anyone else, but 
rather frum a failure on the part of society 
to accurately identify the real problems. 
Some people feel that underrepresentation 
can be fixed with affirmative action, be-
cause they believe racism exists at the en-
try level. But underrepresentation can only 
be fixed by promising minorities equality 
of opportunity. Guaranteeing equal primary 
education and initial opportunity would

Still, the misunderstanding of diversity 

extends well beyond the eauses. It also in-
cludes its influences. Far too many students

And while some people cite the dispro-

is the key to educa-

would end racism, 
lead to overall unity 
and drastically im-

gue that anything 
short of "fair and

can only mean racism 
and inequality. This is 
wrong as well.

the national race prob-
lem, this is not neces-
sarily a negative situ-
ation which requires 
fixing. In many cases, 
the people themselves 
have chosen to live or. 
work in thC?ir particu-
lar environments. It 
only becomes a prob-
lem when the racial 
imbalance spawns ten-
sion or prejudice. 

But this does not 
always happen, and 
here lies the crux of 
the argument of diver-

mately 72 percent whites and 12 percent 
blacks. However, we cannot expect this ra-
tio to exist in every school, town and of-
fice. While UCSD may be only 2.5 percent 
black, there are also numerous schools with 

sity supporters. They tend to believe thai 
all environments without a precise balance 
of races and cultures will automatically be 
racist. But just because a school - or an 
entire city for that matter - consi~ts of pre-

to come. However, Vincente acknowledged 
that the implementation of new outreach 
programs, which are cunently under con-
sideration, could reduce such effects. 

fornia residency - with over 70 percent 
coming from the southern region of the 
state. Although this policy is excellent in 
terms of providing educational opportuni-

ties for California People's origins, in 
terms of location and 
economic class, are 
equally important when 
discussing diversity. 
The environmental dif-
ferences between the 
majority of students of 
color are not as varied 

residents, the diver-
sity of California '5 
college students is 
compromised to some 
extent.

dominantly one race does not mean that it 
discriminates against other races, or that it 
has limited or prevented the entrance of 
these other races by denying them fair and 
equal opportunity. It i.r possible for a white 
student to receive a proper education in a 
predominantly black environment - and 
vice vena. 

At the same time, guaranteeing diversity 
would not even _achieve the goals that its 
supporters desire. It would not magically 
soften the racial divide, nor would it win 
minorities equality. Again, those problems 
need to be fixed from the bottom up. 

UCSD's Cross-Cultural Center (Ccq 
serves as a prime example of how the push 
for diversity represents nothing more than 
imagery - people palling themselves on 
the backs, thinking they have done well in 
the fight against injustice, while the real 
problems lay untouched. The debate for the 
CCC was long, and frequently confronta-
tional, but its "victory" has hardly matched 
the fervor of the debate. No~ has the CCC

of students receive some type of financial 
aid, without which they could not afford to 
attend the university. Students ineligible for 
grants and unable to commit to a lOin sim-
ply cannot enter the UC system. Again, this 
greatly limits the variety of people at UCSD 
- as the majority of students come from 
the middle class. 

It is also important to examine all as-
pects of campus life - not simply tbe ma-
jor issues such as ethnicity, education and 
economic background. Diversity means va-
riety, wbich can also be extended to include 
everyday issues, sucb as dress IIId social

studies - from broad-based Japa-

more specific African American 
Contemporary Arts program - is 
far from sufficient to add a hint of 
spice to campus life. 

Another example of the lack of 
diversity at UCSD is dress, which 
is noticeably conservative. And 

though there arc exceptions, the 
majority of students blend together 
in a blur of smart to semi-smart 
fashion. 

Not only is the social life on this 
campus virtually nonexistent, but the 
only availabie social activity is aimed 
largely at freshmen - another ex-
ample of the lack of diversity at 
UCSD. With the ovcr-21 drinking law 
practically splitting the student popu-
lation down the middle, the absence 
of interaction between the younger 
and more mature students is under-
standable. 

The UCSD Guardian 

appreciate otber races, or that tbey 
need to improve their understand-
ing of tbem. Therefore, I predomi-
nantly wbite institution - sucb as 
UCSD - docs not need total di-
versity to fulfill its educational 
program. (The courses here teach 
enough multi-ethnic culture for 
that.) 

Still, diversity is not entirely 
disposable. We do need it to I cer-
tlin extent, Ind UCSD's racial 
composition does, in fact, contrib-
ute to racial segregation and in-

Another reason students are seg-
regated is the distance from campus 
to other student-populated areas -
Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and 
Hillcre:st - where rent is more rea-
sonable and the atmosphere is more 
relaxed. 

More a collection of suburbs 
than an actual city, it is virtually 
impossible to navigate in San Di-
ego without a car. Driving creates 
an impersonal atmosphere which 
makes social interaction less likely. 
Students commute to and from the 
university, trying to spend as little 

equality in society. A public uni-
versity of higher education di-
rectly feeds Ihe upper-level jobs in 
society. When schools such IS 
UCSD graduate primarily white 
students, whites will conlinue to 
hold those jobs, and minorities 
will still not have won equality. 

But once again, we need to ex-
amine and fix the root causes. 
Pushing unqualified minorities-
with inadequate primary or sec-
ondary education - directly up to 
the university level may promote 

time at school as possible. 
UCSD campus life, like tbat of 

other SUburban-based universities, 
resembles the uniformity of Ameri-
can suburban life during the t 9505, 
an era which encouraged small, 
close-knit communities. Overall, it 
discourages individualism. La Jolla 
is a prime example of this type of 
bourgeois suburbia - not the best 
atmospbere for tbe growth and de-
ve~pment of a diverse community. 

Wbat can be done to develop a 
more fair representation of the di-

diversity on campus. However, il 
is a band-aid aolution and would 
not lead to diversity in society 
overall. And that is the goal we III 
seck to achieve. 

Providing minorities the proper 
opportunity through equal primary 
and secondary schooling would 
guarantee diversity at both the uni-
versity level and in the rest of so-
ciety. That way, we wouldn't need 
so many protests and the regents 
wouldn't have to endure so much 
unwarranted criticism. 

UCSD? And, less seriously, how 
can the mundane campus life be 
made more varied and less boring? 

The first ques,ion requires a de-
tailed structural analysis of 
America's economic classes and 
educational system. As for the sec-
ond question, perhaps the answer is 
a focused base for student interac-
tion. This would enable us to inter- . 
act with a larger group of people on 
a regular basis, and it may eventu-
ally lead to the diversity and indi-
vidualism which should be present 
at any university.

Continued from .... 1 
media. Myers explored different 
modes of communication - nota-
bly language and photography -
and their depictions of "blackness ... 

"Knowledge is reduced when it 
is represented visually and linguis-
tically," he said. 

Christopher Newfield, an English 
professor at UC Santa Barbara, ar-
gued that meritocracy, or the idea 
that people should be rewarded 
solely on the basisoftheiracademic 
merit, is implicitly racist when it is 
applied to college admissions. 

In particular, Newfield criticized 
the use of standardized tests to mea-
sure a person's intelligence, and he 
called for the abolition of tbe Scholas-
tic Aptitude Test as a criterion for the 
university admissions process. 

"Why is it that when people look at 
racial differenctS in SAT scores they 
don 't say, 'Wel~obviouslythesetests 
are fucked,'" Newfield said. 

"We have to find some better 
form for testing potential," he added.

hostory profcuor Harold Wechsler 
explained the evolution of the uni-
versity admilliona proc:aa. 

Wechsler said the implementa-
tion of an admissions policy does 
not nCCCSl8rily ensure its success, 
nor does it solve the social problems 
which go deeper than the policy 
itself. 

UC Santa Cruz psychology pro-
fessor Aida Hurtado, who is a mem-
ber of the lIC Latino Eligibility 
Taskforce, examined the roots of 
Latino eligibility defICiencies in Cali-
fomia. 

"The reason we care about Latinos 
isbccause in the future, we're going 
to be a major problem numerically. 

NEWS 9 

We will be supporting the older 
white population's IOdaI-aec:urity 
benefits, .. Hurtado said. 

Although turnout at the mnfer-
ence was less than organizers had 
cxpccted, Guti&rezsaidthe ideasprc-
sented made the forum a success. 

Graduate student Bernard Dc La 
Cruz said he was drawn to the forum 
partly because of his concern about 
the regents' decision to abolish af-
firmative action without suggesting 
any replacement policies. 

Dc La Cruz said he now has a 
greater grasp of the affirmative-ac-
tion issues. 

"I now have my own arsenal on the 
topic of affirmative action," he said. 

Theory: Prof. Bob Myers encourages the crowd to end stereotypes.

Melmuuid, 

"The fiaid rules of collective 
bargaining are antithetical to the 
university experience." Melman 
added. 

However. certain ASH mem-
bers ICC themselves as "profes-
sional educators." and thereby ar-
gue that they are entitled to collec-
tive bargaining. 

"Graduate studentS' are a very 
vulnerable group because there is 
no protection for sny type of em-
ployment rights for us. II is all at 
the benevolence of the adminis-
tration," Johnston said. 

"What [collective bargaining] 
does is give us a voice indecisions 
which affect us ... We don 't want 
to be at the mercy of the adminis-
tration." he added. 

Anthony Navarrete. a literature

SIt ..... : Graduate students occupied Chancellor Atkinson's office 
last October. demanding unionization and recognition for ASE. 

"Our union members are a vital 
part of the teaching mission of the 
university and. as such. deserve 
the same; fights as other workers," 
he said UNION: ASE has

weeks ago. 

"We're ecstatic about the deci· 
sion." ASE staff member Dan 
Johnston said. "The impact of the 
ruling right away will probably be 
nil, but we will use it as an organiz-
ing tactic." 

UCSD administrators and stu-
dent workers ha ve been at odds over 
the issue of unionization since the 
formation of the ASE in 1989. 

While ASE members say they 
have the right to form a union and 
collectively bargain, administrators 
contend that the implementation of 
a union within the university envi-
ronment could be harmful to the

educational experience. namely be-
cause a union might "intrude into 
academic matters." 

"The idea that we should union-
ize in this setting just doesn't make 
any sense from an academic point of 
view,"ViceCllancellorofResearch/ 
Dean of Graduate Studies Richard 
Attiyeh said. "Traditional union con-
cepts such as seniority ... don't re-
ally fit into this setting. 

"The trouble when you go into 
this collective bargaining mode is 
that you have union organizers in-
volved with university relations 
people, and the academic side 
doesn ' t control the situation any-
more," Attiyeh added. 

UCSp Labor Relations Manager 
Mike Melman echoed Attiyeb'ssen-
timents. 

"Collective bargaining for un-
dergraduates and graduates is not in 

Administrators. however, have 
insisted that while student workers 
do perform a service for the univer-
sity. tbei r positions are "part and 
parcel" of their education, giving 
them a valuable educational experi-
ence, while at the same time giving 
them financial support to enable 
them to continue in their graduate 
studies. 

"Readers and tutors are prima-
rily students rather than employees, 
in the sense that both appointments 
that they have and the compensa-
tion that they get are directly tied to 
their graduate training." Attiyeh 
said. 

"If the university wanted to ap-
proach these things as jobs and not 
as leaming experiences. there may 
be miny people better qualified for 
them th.1l students," he added.

vel: Strikers 
demand equal

ContInued from __ 1 
include: the reinstatement and re-
vision of affirmative action 
throughout the UC system, accu-
rate and equal representation of 
California's diverse population 
within the university, a reversal of 
the last five years' fee hikes, addi-
tional financial aid proportional to 
tuition increases and that no 

charges be filed against the pro-

In order to show support for the 
hunger strikers, students and com-
munity members recently erected 
a "tent city" on the UCI campus, in 
which other students fasted for a 
few days at a time. 

Also, in a series of rallies beld

test.

Fall Rush A 
Success Sig Ep and Alpha Chi Omega....f:==C~ 

This year's fall rush 
ended up being the 
most successful rush the 
UCSD Greek system has 
seen in recent times. 
Although the sheer 
numbers involved in 
the rush were about the 

same as last year, VP 
Marketing Kalen Lagerquist 
said, "the most impressive 
part was the quality of the 
men and women who rushed-
it has been obvious to the 
entire Greek system." There 
were about 130 men who 
joined the 15 frateinities and 
about 150 women that joined 
the 9 sororities.

Sigma Phi Epsilon 
kicked off the tenth season of 
lFC Sports Banner competition 
last week.by winning the team 
volleyball competition over 
Sigma Chi. The win marked 
the SigEp's first victory in the 
team volleyball competition. 

Playing the 
tournament in the RIMAC 
arena for the first time, SigEp 
and Sigma Chi played in what 
turned out to be one of the 
closer matches of the week. In 
the first game, both sides 
started out fairly even with a 5-
5 score. Sigma Chi then took 
command of the net play, 
ju~ping .out to a 12-~ lead. 
With theIr backs agamst the 
wall, the SigEp's turned up 
their level of play to tie the 
game up at 13-13. After several 
sideouts from both sides SigEp 
captured the first game 15-13. 
Going into game two it looked 
as though Sigma Chl was 
unphased winning the first two 
serves, but SigEp's momentum 
kept rolling as they racked up 

champions, Lance Taschner 
and Sean Langdon as well as 
setter Arnold Castano, the 
SigEps stayed tough building 
up a 14-3 advantage. Sigma 
Chi staged a mini rally, 
building up to 7 points before 
SigEp clinched the 
championship off of a blocked 
kill attempt.

they were not hungry yet, so they laid out in

The trees surrounding the meadow practi-

Daisy had spotted the meadow from the road. 
He could ba~ely see the car from where he 
was. But this was her first time up into the 
mountains, and she was watching the scen-

trees to the car. As she drove away, Sean 
sensed something odd. It was quiet. There 
were no birds chirping, no animals scurrying, 
just dead silence. Sean got the chills. The 
lonely expanse of the surrounding forest 
frightened him. The tall, looming trees above 
him seemed giant.

As Sean

But it was too late. 
Nothing was left but his 
bones. The ferns re-

grass quickly collected clearing. This was 

the only spot in the forest that was not clut-
tered with trees. The open meadow consisted 
of tall, green grass, wild daisies, poppies and 
ferns-all of them basking in the warmth of 
the sun's rays.

"Oh, you probably forgot it at home." 
"No, I know that I packed it, it has to be

"Don't worry, Daisy, it's no big deal. 

There was a store in that village just five

"I'm sorry, Sean, I wanted this to be per-

minutes," Daisy said, as she blew him a kiss. 

He looked down and saw that the ferns had 
wrapped around his ankles. Sean grabbed and 
pulled at them with all his strength, but nothing 
happened. Morefems wrapped around his wrists 
and forced him to lie down. He watched in 
horror as the daisies and poppies came alive. 
Such innocent flowers had somehow turned

her. But she pulled on 
those hiking boots any-
way and strode out the 
back door toward the 
blood-ruddy, purple 
horizon. 

It snaked along an 
edge over mossy mounds of hills 
that were. visibly grassy just ten 
minutes before - soon to be moor-
like under the ice-cave moon. 
Karen's steps slopped and trudged 
against the dirt, but it seemed too 
flat to even kick up a spray of dusl. 
She slammed down the boots harder. 

Somewhere along this series of 
stompings, she remembered tbat she 
had forgotten to bring Ihe large fam-
ily flashlighl. Hesitating over 
whether or not she should go back 
for it at the peak of Ihe slope, she 
stopped abruptly. 

Then ahe listened. 
Even at the bills, Karen could 

hear tbe bars creak. And the sbrill of

the swings, and the rustles of the 
branches. She wished there were a 
wind to hide the quiet clamor, to 
give some nwvement to this bone-
dead nighl. Sbe thought of running, 
but thought she might end up slam-
ming into a kee or missing the tum-
off. So she walked on, estimating 
every step, because it grew harder 
and harder 10 tell where the rocks 
lay. 

At Ihe lurnoff, it grew easier, 
and Karen was able to concentrate 
lessontheevents-iftheycouldbe 
called "events" -al hand. And she 
found tbat the more she focused on 
stream-of-consciousness ideas thai 
ran through her mind, the less she 

. could hear tbe creaks and cringes in 
tbe distance. 

And then she was al the play-
ground. 

Funny how al sucb a place she 
could feel so much death. So much 
impending. hell-raising awfulness. 
Karen imagined the giggJeaand frol-
icking of the kids here during the 
day. Now, her images of them 

seemed to move slower over the 
dark and shadowed shells of metal 
rings and stepladders. The lanbark 
like coal, the skeletons of the hang-
ing swings, the moon like a dead 
sun. All bollowand full of dead 
spirit. 

With a timber step, she reached 
the blacktop edge of the basketball 
court by the playground. It was jusl 
so incredibly sti/lthal she felt like a 
violator every time she moved, 
breathed. And there were so many 
things she couldn'l see behind Ihe 
trees, Ihe schoolhouse, her back. 

She spun around 10 check tbe 
trees behind her and moved slowly 
back to survey the rest oflhe foresly 
area from where she had sprung. 
But the furry tree branches just 
mocked her, and so she slepped 
slowly back, loward the swing set. 

And in her mind's eye, she could 
see them. The dozen or so pallid 
ghost-children, moving wilh mo-
notonous ease over the jungle gym 
and handle bars. Ashes darkening 
Iheir eyes, limp silk-cobweb hair, 

screams locked behind their lips. 
Out of the comers of their eyes, 
sometimes they would dart a glance 
at her, piercing her eyes. Rage, dark, 
fear, formulated hate - all concen-
trated into tbe tips of those baby-
eye pupils. . 

So painful and deadly that she 
closed her own. Then she looked to 
the sky. It hung entirely devoid of 
stars, with jagged tree tips thai 
stretched up and cursed these heav-
ens, screaming in silent fury . 

She sat down on the corner 
swing, making itsqueallouder. And 
she began to push. She pushed and 
pumped . and pushed and pumped . 
and ... the hinges squealed shriller 
and louder -like a banshee bowl-
ing in the night, ferociously wailing 
in screams that could make hard-
ened soldiers weep. And the faster 
she shoved and scraped her beels 
against the tanbark, the more vivid 
her images of the children became. 

Now, they were scrawling and 
clawing at her, ringing-round-the-
rosy on all sides. Their as'b-eyes 

slapping her with dart glances, so 
that she shut her own. And the air 
was still so dead, and all she could 
hear was the creaking, squeaking of 
the swing, anti feel the sour-hot 
breath of the children on hercheeks. 

Then her eyes shot open. She 
saw the jagged tips of trees in front 
of her, like a row of palisades along 
a fence. And she saw that tbe chil-
dren weren't there - notbing was 
there, onl y her and creaking and 
breathless sky. 

Not enough and more than too 
much she .wanted to go back. But 
her feet wouldn't stop pumping, 
and she knew that she wu going to 
join them, wbether she wanted to or 
not. With a sharp push, sbe lifted off 
tbe swing - and soaoothrough the 
air toward one asb-cbild's arms. 
She graced through the air down-
ward, and opened her own. She met 
tbe child, the palisades, tbe ban-
shee-creaking of the swings -then 
her own sleep. 

And the moment her eyes closed, 
tbe wind began to blow again

By Jason Forbes 
tacey walked toward tbe Sun God witb the 
note clutched tightly in her hand. It said to 
meet at the usual rendezvous at midnight 
and was signed "R.A." She crept out of her 
Muir apartment wbile her roommates slept, 
wearing a beavy, cotton sweater, sweat 
pants and wool socks to keep warm. The 
fog was thick and blinding, but she had the 
route memorized. 

Stacey found him waiting on their patch of grass 
under tbe Sun Gbel. Sbe walked up to bim and witbout 
saying a word he reacbed oul and caressed bersoft, tan 
cheeks. His hands moved to her long, black bair as 
their lips touched in the cold nigbt air. With open 
mouths, he gently sucked on her sweet tongue. She 

opened her eyea slightly to stcaI a glimpse of bis 
passion only to sec two beady, red eyes staring doWD al 

her. Before she could react, be bit down on ber tongue. His 
hands firmly held her head in place, as he pressed his teeth 
deep inside her mouth, biting and gnawing wildly until her 
tongue ripped free from her mouth. 

Her limp body collapsed to .tbe ground wben he released 
her. Blood poured from her mouth, as she lay helplessly on her 
back, balf conscious. She tried to breatbe but onJy gagged on 
her own blood as he swallowed her tongue. Pulling out a knife 
with a razor-sharp, six-inch blade, hecut her clothes-down the 
front, ~vealing the beautiful curves of her naked body. She 
reached up in an effort to stop him, but he punched her in tbe 
face, breaking her nose. 

He ran the knife down her body, opening her from neck 
to crotch. Peeling her skin back he took large gulps of her 
warm, sticky, sweet blood. Avidly he plunged deeper, 
ripping the still-warm organs out with his teeth. He slashed 

his way through ber ribcage and bit down on her heart which 
pulsated one last time in the clutches of his jaw. The feast 
lasted well into the night. 

The sun shined bright the next moming. "Where's the boss?" 
John asked as he walked into the chancellor's offlCC. "He wanted 
me to let him know as soon as there was a ~reak in the case." 

"He left about an hour ago, John," the chancellor's secre-
tary said. "He said he wasn't feeling well, so he went bome. 
Did tbey catch Ihe person who killed that poor girl?" 

"The police found a note in the girl's pocket, signed 
'R.A.,· and it turns out ~hat her Resident Advisor had bought 
her flowers the day before. So it looks like they caught their 
man." 

John, the chancellor's apprentice, tried calling him at 
home only to get a busy signal. He jumped in his car and 
decided to tell the chancellor the news iR person. 

Jobn rang the doorbell and the chancellor let hIm in. "You're 
really pale, sir," John said as he walked into the living room. 

"I must have caught that stomach flu that's going al'9und," 
the chancellor replied. "So I assume that your presence here 
means that they caught the devil who mutilated Stacey." 

"I'm happy to say that the 'police have arrested L .... 
Witbout warning, the chancellor held bis stomach and 

threw up allover tbe living-room carpet. Jobn quickly ush-
ered him into tbe kitcben, wbere he finished tbe job down the 
garbage disposal. 

"Leave, John," he demanded when he caught his breath. 
"('II call you later." 

John left the chancellor drooped over the sink and care-
funy avoided the scattered chunks of barf as he made his way 
toward the door. His eyes began to water as the thick stench 
overloaded his senses. As he reacbed for the door, a peculiar 
chunk caught his eye. He took a closer look ... d realized that · 
it was tbe tip of a finger. Looking to bis left he saw wbat 
looked to be a chewed up ear. He realized that the smell was 
tbat of burnt flesh. The floor was littered with acid-burned 
flesh and meat from the chancellor's stomach. 

Shaking uncontrollabl y, John slowly lifted his head lo.see the

With the hope of creati ng a safe environment on 
Halloween for the children of UCSD students, the 
Early Childhood Development Center is hosting 
an in-house trick-or-treat on Oct. 3 J • 

Fo llowing a week of costume design by the 
children and preparation by classroom teachers 
and UCSD students, the children and faculty 
will trick-or-treat from room to room within the 

center. 
This event not only provides 

a safe Halloween environment, 
it also gives the kids an opportu-
nity to design and construct 
their own original costumes 

-ones which do not advo-
cate violence, said cen-

ter director Josie 
Foulks. «~.I>~ "Halloween is 
a very chIld-ori-

ented holiday, and 
unfortunately, 

through the years, it has 
become a nightmare in 

terms of the costumes and 'tampering with candy. 
The costumes are scary and really violent; and you 
are now afraid to have children go out because 
there's so much junk they ' re putting in the treats," 
parent-teacher coordinator Trudy Campbell said. 
"Now, [trick-or-treating] is ... something else that 
the children cannot do, and we're trying to provide 
a chance for the kids to come together in a safe 
environment. " 

" By having the chirdren make their own cos-
tumes, we ' re trying to curtail the violence por-
trayed ... by the Power Rangers and so forth," 
Foulks added. 

With this idea in mind, teachers were able to 
make classroom lessons highlighting the dan-
gers involved with trick-or-treating, Campbell

candy in the Pumpkin Drop's history. 

Since then, the piles of candy have 
usually accumulated to nearly 100 pounds, 
making the frenzied scramble for the 
smashed pumpk.in quite profitable for the 
average sweet tooth. The idea of a pump-
kin drop was apparently well appreciated 
in its early years, because the event has 
endured, remaining a popular part of Muir's 
annual Halloween Carnival. 

For approximately 20 years, the arrival 
of Halloween marks the return of a Muir 
College tradition, the celebrated Pumpkin

campus. They came up with the idea of 

crete ' "target" in Muir's main 
quad, eagerly waiting fqr an 
enormous, candy-packed 
pumpkin to plummet from 

the Pumpkin Drop and asked Muir 
residents to provide the candy which 

would go inside the cored, mon-
ster vegetable.

Unknown to moslStudents at UCSD, the ground 
deep beneath their feet is home to a complex 
system of spooky tunnels running throughout 
campus. 

Despite its poorly lit and dank atmosphere, 
many students often go into the tunnels in the 
pursuitoffun and adventure_ "I guess it 's kindof 
like exploring a cave. Students are fascinated by 
[the tunnels]," said Utilities Engineer Mike Breen. 
" ... People are interested in scaring themselves." 

There are padlocks and silent alarms hooked up to 

each tunnel entrance, but according to Breen, students 
still manage to get in. He remembers an incident a 

few years ago when he encountered a girl lost 
inside the Central Utilities Plant. 

"She asked me if I knew the way oul. But as 
soon as I turned my back, she tried to sneak back 
in," he said. 

The labyrinth of dark corridors holds evi-
dence of their visits - as graffiti covers the 

huge asbestos-insulated pipes.

Spooky houses around town 
By BrIce Ritter 
Contributing Features Writer 

In recent weeks, several haunted houses 
have popped up, hoping to scare even the 
most brave San Diegans. For the most part, 
these are not the kooky, little haunted houses 
we visited as kids - where our friends cov-
ered themselves in bed sheets and fluttered 
about, making their best ghost noises. 

Instead, these ghoulish places appeal to 
our demented sense of sadism, incorporating 
high-tech special effects, which combine the 
Halloween themes of terror, torture, rape and 
murder, into an enjoyable evening on the 
town. 

At the entrances of these hellish houses, 
people start jockeying for a position some-
where in the middle of a pack of courageous ' 
patrons, blatantly disregarding normal social 
etiquette. Although nothing frightful has yet 
transpired, the consensus seems to be: Save 
yourself, just in case. 

Nothing has really changed at haunted 
houses since the early days, except for maybe 
the manner in which customers are scared. 
Way back when, ghosts, goblins and grim 
reapers stalked their prey at these scare- 'em-
si Ily houses. 

The format today is still the same: Brave 
souls pass from room to room, huddled with 
agroupof complete strangers, bound by anxi-

ety and anticipation - al-
though the strangers are of-
len sacrificed as a sh ield from 
the slash of a chain saw or the 
jab ofa plastic knife. The dif-
ference is that the present-
day format is more adept to 
the times. The grim reaper is 
outdated-now, we can see 
reenactments of torture, ad-
ministered by some guy, 
who might be a postal 
worker. 

On the comer of 4th and 
Market, a long lineof people 
leads- up 10 one of the best 
haunted houses in town, the 
Haunted Hotel. With the in: 
credible popularity of this par-
ticular venue, be prepared to 
wait up to an hour to get in. 

Once inside, however, the vi-
sual intensity Immediately begins 
with the gruesome scene of an execution. A 
prisoner is strapped into an electric chair and, 
before your eyes, goes into violent convul-
sions, punctuated by a strobe light and aggra-
vated sound effects. Though I have never seen 
a real execution, this one looked pretty au-
thentic. The steal helmet encasing the 
prisoner's head, and the way he spasmodi-

cllly jerked around, both added greatly to the 
overall sensation of horror. 

Between sets, the faint-hearted and squea-
mish balked incessantly while traversing 
through the dark corridors. At one point, some-
body grabbed a hold of my arm, probably 
thinking it belonged to someone else. Then, 

when we reached the next room, the safety of 
light betrayed us, as ~idden actors either 
popped ~ut of a cadaver's stomach, kicked 
through a false wall brandishi ng a meat cleaver 
or exhibited some dreadful mutilation_

lls scent was unmistakable. 

This one was the same as those 
who had come before it, making 
it easy prey. Like the others, no 
one would notice that this one 
was missing. Through the end-
less alleyways of the city they 
had pursued it, watching its 
movements and activities for 
days, but always remaining out 
of sight. However, tonight was 
different. 

Tonight was just like any other 
for Jake. Roaming through the 
back alleys, pushing his few be-
longings in a shopping cart, he 
picked out whatever he could from 
the trash cans behind restaurants 
and stores. Jake was in search of 
something that would relieve that 
nagging grumble in his stomach. 
After finding half of a hamburger 
and almost swallowing it whole, 
Jake was chased away by a store~ 
owner who had turned a hose on 
him. Soaking wet, Jake headed to 
the park and his usual nightly

dwellina. a tarp thrown over a 
couple trees. 

The moment was growing near, 
and the packs' anticipation of the 
kill was growing just as fast. II 
had been days since they had in-
gested anything, and their hunger 
was growing by the moment. Soon 
it would be satisfied, but the m0-
ment was not yet right. Knowing 
their quarry 's nightly routine, they 
headed to tbe park to await the 
moment. 

The air became cold, as the sun 
retreated from the moon. Memo-
ries of the past flooded Jake's 
mind. as he lethargically walked 
toward the park. Noticing his 
breath formingabeadofhim, Jake 
took a swig of Jack Daniels to 
warm himself. As tbe park grew 
closer, Jake's journey was com-
ing to an end. 

The blackness of night was 
upon them as was the moment 
whicb grew nearer with each of 
the prey's steps. It would all end 
soon, but the process had to l:Je

conducted with care, so that their 
presence remained unknown to 
mankind. The master would give 
the necessary signal when the 
time was right. It now walked 
between them, not even realiz-
ing the danger that encompassed 
it. 

Jab laboriously pulled his cart 
over the gravel path. Hearing 
something move behind him,Jake 
quickly turned to see a large dog 
run across the path. A dog roam-
ing the park is nothing new, so 
Jake continued on his way. Veer-
in.g off the path, he dragged his 
shopping cart through the trees. 

After walking about fifty yards, 
he was home. After changing out 
of the wet clothes, Jab collapsed 
on a mattress under the tarp. Hear-
ing a growling sound, Jake awoke' 
with a start. Looking up, five large 
dogs stood before him. After star-
ing at the dogs for a few seconds, 
he saw a faint, red glow in their 
eyes, and knew that something 
wasn't right. Slowly backing 
away through the back of the 
dwelling, the dogs began encir- , 
cling him. Bolting out of his 
dwelling, Jake leapt to his feet 
and scrambled into the surround-
ing trees. 

The moment arrived and 
adrenaline rushed through the 
pack's veins. It was asleep when 
they had moved out of the dark-
ness, only to awake when they 
had made their presence known 
to it. Moving in closer, they had 
flushed it out of its dwelling. The 
plan was unfolding the same as it 
had the many times before. They 
followed it closely through the 

trees, steerIng it toward the ob-
jective. 

Looking bebind himself, he 
saw tbe hellish beasts in pursuit. 
Suddenly, his body connected 
with an object and fell to the 
ground. Looking up, he saw a 
large man dressed in black. 
Quickly, Jake turned around an- _ 
ticipating an attack from the pur-
suing creatures, but they were 
gone. The large man came around 
from behind, and started to bring 
Jake to his feet, while Jake was 
mumbling a,bout hounds from hell. 
The man only chuckled slightly, 
and then said "I know little man ... 
they are mine." Looking over his 
shoulder, Jake saw a bright, red 
glow in the man 's eyes, only to be 
followed by a sharp pain in his 
neck. The -pain was immense, but 
it started fading, and an uncon-
trollable sleep was coming over 
him. Before his eyc.s shut, he saw 
the red eyes ofthe hounds in front 
of him, staring, waiting for their 
meal.

Free 'Food 
By Elaine Cull 

Seven-thirty in the morning is an 
awful time to be anywhere but in 
bed, asl~p' like a basset hound in 
~he summer heat. Somehow, wak-
IDg up seems even worse when I 
know the early hour is somewhat 
self-inflicted. I could have avoided 
working mornings. Nevertheless, 
every Monday morning I slide out 
of bed and trudge over to EDNA to 
help the lost and confused. 

This is why, to the great confu-
sion of my brain, my legs are carry-
ing me to the Price Center. The rest 
of my body is in a stupor, with 
which any rational human being 
could identify, except that race of 
people we call "morning people. " 

Suddenly, a sign catches my eye. 
Somewhere inside, a toothpick 
pokes my awareness. Then I pass 
another poster. Now. a pin is nettling 
me. I pass yet another sign. Now the 
awake part within produces a cattle 
prod. My attention is caught. 

I read the next brightly colored 

sign, which proclaims: 
Students! 
free food 
something for everyone -
BBQ 
deep-fry 
low-fat 
international salad 
and more ... 
PC Ballroom 
all day 
Sometimes, I love being a col-

lege student. I just hope that there's 
still some food left when I get off 
work. 

I arrive at EDNA and perform the 
usual morning opening ritual. The 
voice mail is off, the windows are 
open, the "open" sign is turned over 
and the stereo is on. I am in ready 
stance for the first calls. I peer across 
the Price Center, trying to discern 
what I can about the advertised meal. 
Already, a line has formed out the 
sliding doors. This must be good food. 
The phone interrupts my study. Dis-
tracted, I pick it up.

"EDNA, can I help you?" 
"Yeah, do you know where the 

free food is?" 
"I'm looking at the line right 

now. II's in the Price Center Ball-
room." 

"OK, thanks." 
Apparently, news travels fast. For 

the next hour, the phone rings' re-
lentlessly. The usual requests for 
the number for RIMAe and the lo-
cation of the Post Office are buried 
under the queries about the feast in 
the ballroom. By nine o'clock, hop-

ing that I can staunch the flow of 
walk-ups, I post a sign outside with 
an arrow pointing to the ballroom. 

By ten o'clock, the line extends 
across the second·f1oor walkway. 
By ten-thirty, it winds down the 
stairs. I wonder why students are 
not flowing out the other side of the 
ballroom. 

"They must be redirecting them 
somewhere else," I think and - too 
deluged to do otherwise - my mind 
moves on. 

At ten-fifty, my fellow EDNA 
worker arrives to replace me. 

"Busy morning?" she asks. 
The only wly I can explain is 

with a painful look. 
"That bad?" 
"I think you got here just in time. 

It looks like the whole hoopla has 
finally plateaued," I say. "Some 
people have all the luck. " 

"Are you going to check out 'the 
hoopla'?" 

"Are you kidding? My hunger 
and curiosity reached their satura-

tion levels about an hour ago, and 
they 've been overflowingsi nce then. 
Have you been over there?" 

"Nah. The line 's too long. But 
you enjoy yourself." 

I step out into the plaza, thinking 
she must be insane to pass up this 
deal, and stride over to the line IS 
fast as I can, without looking des-
perate. Surprisingly, the wait is not 
long. Within fifteen minutes, I ap-
proach the inner doors of the ball-
room. Above the door, a sign is 
posted, advising faculty to have their 
IDs ready. I guess they believe that 
students are students. 

The minute hand of my watch 
moves a few more times and lam at 
the threshold of The Event The 
doors are closed, which seems odd. 
But it's free food, so who's com-
plaining? I open the doors. I have 
just enough time to glimpse a ban-
ner that details the menu - fried 
students, student salad, stir-fry stu-
dent, BBQ student... - before cold 
hands drag me inside.

say, ' Hey, I want to be one of those 
ninjas,' [that) areal definition ofa ninja is 
an assassin .... We want them to take a 
close look at what these things represent," 
Campbell said. "The children get really 
into it and become very creative." 

The center, composed of 35 part-
time and work-study stutlents, numer-
ous classroom teachers and 156 chil-
dren, has hosted this event since its open-
ing in 1970. 

"When we were located on campus, we 
used to go trick-or-treating to the different 
departments, asking people not to give the 
kids candy, but rather nutritious snacks 
like raisins, peanuts and fruit," Foulks 
said. "But since we ' re now a mile from the 
main campus, we've localized it here [at 
the center)." 

The success of this event is not only 
attributed to the cooperation of all its 
participants, but also to the desire to up-
hold the tradition of the holiday, Campbell 
said. 

"The reason the parents get so involved 
by donating treats and volunteering their 
time is that every parent, at one point, 
went trick-or-treating and had a good 
time," Campbell added. "We are losing 
the idea that all of tbis is supposed to be a 
fun time for the kids." 

Campbell also stressed the impor-
lance of the children's enjoyment of the 
events. 

"I think it [the Halloween ac:tivity] bas 
a really positive. fun message because the 
parents are participating at all levels, " she 
added. "This is a fun day where the kids 
get a treat ... and learn about the real mean,

celebrates. .. 

TUNNELS: 
Accidents might strike 
sneaking students 
ContInued from .,... 1. 

McGee. 
According to Detective Nate Floyd of the 

UCSD Police Department, campus cops re-
sponded to an activated alann just a few weeD 
ago. When police arrived at the scene. they saw 
two students poke their heads out of a manhole. 
When the students realized they hac! been spot-
ted by the police, they ran back into the tunnel. 

&calise the tunnels are 12-15 feet under the 
ground,c:ontainhigh temperaturewaterud natu-
ral gas pipes and have electrical wiring with up 
to 12,000 volts of current, Utilities Organiza-
tions Manager John Laswell emphasized the 
danger of exploring the tunnels for fun. 

"We have had several high tcmperaIIR water 
leaks. WIler. the steam bui1ds up in the tunne1, 
9OII1CIOI1C oouId get cooked like a1obster," he said. 

Used br the workers at UCSD Physical 
Plant Services, tbe two tunnel systems carry 
virtually every utility imaginable to numerous 
buildings on campus. "They carry hot and 
cold water for heat and air conditioning, elec-
tricity -and natural gas," Laswell said. 

The first system of tunnels, built along 
with the Revelle College campus during the 
early 19608, was designed to connect utility 
pipes from the central plant to l!rey Hall. The 
continued expansion of UCSD, bowever, led 
to a second system added during the mid-
I %Os. "The designera in tbe 60s did a marvel-
ous job planning for the future," Laswell sai~. 

Currently, there are tunnels connected to 
almost every building on campus. "The tun-
nels act basically as distribution conduits for 
campus utilities,· said Breen. "Over tbe past 
couple of years, tbey have also been used by . 
the telecommunications services on campus 
for their fiber-optics connections. " 

According to Laswell, tbe fiber optics ad-
ditioas were installed over tbe lut three to 
four years.

bigger then last year's 
Big Moe 
Continued from pee. 18 
the crop was so bad that a few small pump-
kins had to be thrown off," Muir Residence 
Advisor Pat Danylyshyn-Adams said. 

But as any student wbo witnessed lut 
year's pumpkin drop can tell you, the sheer 
size of "Big Moe" more than compensated 
for any poor pumpkin harvests in years past. 

Big Moe. the niclcnamebestowed upon last 
year's sacrificial pumpkin, traveled more than 
just 11 searies to be a put of UCSD lore. The 
300-p0und pumpkin was grown and harvested 
by Profcaor Bill Baitinger of Purdue Univer-
sity in Indiana. Big Moe's existence was only 
discovered when the evening news on 0Ian-
nel S 1 reported its amazing size. 

Residence council representatives im-
mediately went to work. They called the 
news station, tracked down Baitinger and 
make shipping arrangements. A week be-
fore the camival, a crate arrived at L.A.X. 
containing the largest pumpkin ever dropped 
at the annual event. • 
, Members of the Muir Residence Council 
had a bard time saying goodbye to Big Moe 
when Halloween rolled around. However, 
just lifting the monstrosity seemed like the 
hardest feat of all. "It took six members of 
the council to lift Moe up on a carpet [to the 
balcony]," said Danylyshyn-Adams. 

AB would be the case when any large 
objcct falls from the sky, people took pre-
cautions to make sure that no injuries re-
sulted when Big Moe fell. The bicycle racks 

were moved, and the area near the target was 
blocked off from students. 

According to Cindy Kim, a Muir house 
advisorand witness of the event, "The minute 
the pumpki n dropped, everyone went for the 
candy." The safety precautions are still 
deemed necessary, for pumpkin splatter gen-
erally travels quite far. 

Last year's event was well covered by 
local news stations and newspapers. Media 
reports near Purdue Univeraity made men-
tion of the event, and ESPN ran a national 
report about UCSD and Big Moe. There 
may be similar coverage this year, since the 
1995 pumpkin - which remains unnamed 
- weighs 100 pounds more than Big Moe, 
prior to being filled with candy. 

UCSD Professor Mark Spiegelberg has 
generously offered to donate his 400-pound 
pumpkin for this year's sacrifice. Harvested 
from La JoUa on Thursday, Oct. 26, the 
pumpkin will reside at Muir's residential 
life office until the actual event - sched-
uled for 12:30 p.m. Halloween day. 

Plans for this year's Halloween Carnival 
are well underway. At present, each house at 
Muir College will be in charge of one of 25 
booths, each with a different theme. Every 
year, the carnival is a well-attended event-
people are eager to buy tickets, browse 
through the different booths and listen to the 
live bands. But it is the pumpkin drop which 
gives the carnival its unique flair- usually 
deemed the highlight of the day. 

Excitement has been steadily building over 
this year's drop. And with today's prevalence 
of genetic engineering, there is the possibility 
that Dr. Spiegelberg could chum out some-
thing even larger in the near future.

disembowelments at least vaguely

little differently, whether you prefer 
psychological suspense, gut-
wrenching gore, optical illusion or 
outright violence - it 's all there. 

Guides stay with each group to

the house and to ensure that nobody

(Someone fainted during,my visit.) 
II's all very well-orchestrated to pro-

the Haunted Hotel wins.

away from the Haunted Hotel. Don' t

Simply throw a bunch of people 
into a darlc room and - sluwun -
everyone becomes paranoid. Progress 
slows to a snail-paced shuffle, and the 
only guidance offered to the next stage 
is the surrounding walls into which 
everyone seemed to plow. Even the 
slightest of sounds resonated like 
screams as the procession made its 
way through the labyrinth between 
freak shows. In 01lC room, a collection 
of dismembered body parts and de-
capitated heads decorate the walls, 
much like the trophies of a successful 
- albeit perverse - hunter. 

Another room is completely empty, 
comprised exclusively of six doors, 
only one of which leads to the next 
stage. After momentary confusion, the 
right door is found and the monster-
mash continues. 

Frightmare on Market Street is,

Hollywood film ever could. 
The third haunted house is in 

the Mission Valley shopping cen-
ter. A rudimentary counterpart of 
the Haunted Hotel or Frightmare 
on Marlcet Street, The House re-
sorts to more elemental methods of 
horror. The special effects suffer, 
the organization is laclting and even 
the guides don't have a clue what's 
happening. 

Unlilte the other two houses, this 
. one took on the charm that typified 

the horror of haunted houses of yes-
teryear. OIaracters-dressedin what 
appear to be homemade costumes-
harass and haze the patrons by fol-

lowing them, pulling on their clothes 
and poking at them until the fear and 
tolerance of molestation instigate ei-
ther annoyance or defensive mea-
sures.ln fact, the operation manager 
said there hod been complaints of 
harassment. In my group, for instance, 
a mother was flung into a corner of 
the house in the frenzy of the m0-
ment 

Each room resembled the previ-
ous one, adding little variation to an 
already methodical arrangement of 
scare tactics - and was absent of 
any ingenuity. Ending anything but 
monotonously, however, the tourC\i-
maxed with a virtual stampede out

the doorwhensomechain-saw happy 
rogue nearly pronged escapees. 

In comparison to the other two 
houses, where barriers separate IC-
tors from thrill-seekers, guides of-
fer explicit directions and the qual-
ity of entertainment intrigues and 
bedazzles, The House offers a more 
realistic sense of horror. 

The H.uDted MUleu.. in 
Balboa Park was eloquently de-
scribed by the person standing in 
front of me, when he proclaimed, 
"this place is corny." 

The only thing that scared me in 
the slightest was the tbought of 
how we'd all escape from the nar-
row hallways in the event of a fire. 
Of course, by now, I had already 
visited three other haunted houses 
and become unamused by amateur 
scare tactics or some ninny running 
around looking like the grim reaper. 

Little kids ducking out from be-
hind a curtain didn' t even tum my 
head. I had become so jaded that I 
wanted real gore- no plastic hearts, 
no freak wearing a mask waiving a 
rubber liver. I wan!Cdsomethingfrom 
the slaughter house, something that 
dripped with blood and something I 
couldn 't stand to see. Now, I don 't 
mean to take this too far, but if the 
intention is to scare the people, then 
scare them, disgust them and give 
them what they want. 

We treaded on each other'sheels 
at this final gore-fest (more like 
bore-fest), elbowing each other re-
peatedly, scooting along through 
dark halls in production-line fash-
ion. The kids at elbow height got 
the worst of the onslaught. Quite 
often, we stood deadlocked in a 
traffic jam under low ceilings -
breathing hot, musty. stagnant air 
and sweating profusely. These dis-
co'mforts alone turned slight delays 
into sizable excursions into the 
depths of hell - on its hot days. 

A few benjgn little exhibits, such 
as Igor's pet dungeon, were inef-
fective in evoking any fear whatso-
ever. Igor's place looked like some 
kid 's collection of bugs and reptiles 
on display in a cheesy aquarium. 
The only things that did catch my 
eye were the three-inch-Iong cock-
roaches. 1 haven't seen any that big 
since I was in Texas. In a cage, 
they ' re just disgusting - but 
planted in someone's bed, now 
that's Halloween. 

Part of the fun of attending 
haunted houses is watching the re-
actions from the participants. Most 
of the time, people suffer from self-
inflicted fright, screaming before 
their would-be slayer even appears . 
People like to freak out and tense 
up like scared little kittens. It's not 
the blood and guts that make these 
houses so much fun, it's the way 
they make your adrenaline rush -
like the way a good childhood ad-
venture used to do. 

All of the haunted houses will 
remain open until Oct. 31 . ·Prices 
range from S6-8.

UCsp Contests for Top at 
CCAAs; Settles for 2nd, 3rd 
TUNE-UP: The Triton cross-country crews prepared for the upcoming 
NCAA Regionals by running in the California Collegiate Championships 

By LIN CoIatazier 
Staff Writer 

Despite the wheeze-inducing 
smog of Los Angeles, several ath-
letes of tbe UCSD men's and 
women's cross country team ran 
superb races, leading their respec-

his teammates stepped up and car-
ried the squad to its impressive 
finish. 

For the women, sophomore 
Kyndra Smith finished first for 'the 
Tritons and sixth overall with a time 
of 19:30. Only a second behind her 
was freshman Maggie Dwire, who 
improved her race time by 15 sec-
onds. 

Hop, skip, 8nd .... : UCSO's Erik Waldman jumped over the 
Westminster keeper, but his shot sailed wide of the goal. 

tive teams to sec-
ond- and third-place 
finishes in the Cali-
fornia Colegiate 
Athletic Associa-
tion (CCAA) Con-
ference Champion-
ships at UC River-
side on Saturday 

"We had to race without 
[Lindsey)," Triton Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale said. "We didn't 
even know until that morning 
whether he would be able to com-
pete. Other people stepped for-
ward, and we got better produc-
tion out of our top six and seven 
[runners J." 

One of these runners - who 
elevated himself just when the Tri-
tons needed it most - was 
Klingler. 

Other strong finishers were Jane 
Zimmerman (20:25), Robyn 
Herskowitz (20:42), Courtney Gray 
(20:46) and Amanda Wallace 
(20:46), who exceeded her personal 
best by 22 seconds. 

STRONG: 
UCSD wins last two 
ContInued from p8Ce 28 
past UCSD goalkeeper Jason 
Reynoso, making the score 3-1. 

Thefirst opportunity oftbe sec-
ond half came quickly for UCSD, 
but a Hetherington shot caromed 
off the cross bar in the 47th minute 
to prevent the score. Nineteen min-
utes later, the post thwarted yet 
another Triton scoring chance, 
when an Ocampo shot slammed 
into the crossbar and sailed out. 

But the Tritons weren't to be 
denied. In the 84th minute, Shane 
Ferber hit the post yet again, but 
this time junior Joel Kosakoffwas 
in position to head the rebound in, 
extending the UCSD lead to 4-1. 

That advantage was increased 
to 5-1 a minute later on a great 
individual effort by sophomore 
Minh Nguyen. Nguyen lived up to 
his nickname of "Tu rbo" by flying 
through the Parson defense and 
firing a right-footed scorcher to-
ward the goal. The Westminster 
keeper should have been checked 
for third-degree bums, as the shot 
tore into the back of the net to 
round out the scoring. 

"We needed a good showing 
against [Westminster]," Triton 
Head Coach Derek Armstroltg 
said. "The NCAA committee is 
going to look at the scores math-
ematically, and we look like we're 
in pretty good shape." 

The Tritons' victory did indeed 
payoff as they will UCSD host tbe 
NCAA Regionals this Saturday. 

morning. 
On the men's side, J.J. Castner 

took third in the men's race and first 
for UCSD with a time of 25:22. 
Shaving an incredible 52 seconds 
off: his fastest time, sophomore 
Gavin Klinger placed second for 
UCSDat2S:51,finishingninthover-
all. Following him closely, junior 
Bryan Leek finished at 26:00 - a 
personal best by a comfortable 14 
seconds. 

Senior John Walsh came in only 
seven seconds later (26:07), and 
sophomore Neal Harder finished 
fifth for the Tritons at 26:16 

UCSD participated without one 
of the team's top runners, the in-
jured Goss Lindsey,but the rest of 

"I ran well, I was actually kind of 
surprised," Klinger said. "I was just 
feeling good and passing people the 
whole race." 

"[Klinger) dropped his best time 
by a minuteat a championship meet. 
Champions compete better at cham-
pionship meets," Van Arsdale said. 
"He's just been like a volcano, wait-
ing to erupt; and he finally erupted." 

Leek and Harder also turned in 
great races with their personal-best 
runs. 

"[Leek) ran very competitively. 
He's one of our toughest individu-
als," Van Arsdale said. "[Harder] is 
very silent, but very deadly. He's 
like a cobra, waiting for the right 
opportunity to strike. " 

"[Smith] has done a great job 
racing with the pack. She's becom-
ing more aware of staying in the 
front pack," Van Arsdale said. 
"[Dwire] cut down the gap between 
her and [Smith] over the last mile. 
She's pulling her own weight." 

"[Wallace] is very determined, 
very focused, "he added. "The women 
executed. They were very tough in the 
last mile, and they camcd their third 
place. We needed some pcople to step 
forward, and they did." 

Although Saturday's race was a 
conference meet against Division II 
schools, the Tritons next race within 
their own division on Nov. 11 will 
be more important - it is the NCAA 
Regional meet which will decide 
the teams and individuals that will 
go on to the Division III National 
Championships.

At Gordin Invite 
By Tedd L8dd 
Senior St." Writer 

Boasting a veteran with "emmcnsc 
gravitational power," a "sinewy" 
freshman and a stubborn transfer stu-

dent, the UCSD golf 
team kickedoffitssea-
son early at the Fifth 
Annual Powerbilt 
Gordin Collegiate 
aassic on Oct. 20-22. 

Held in the beauti-
ful resort location of 
Surfside Beach, se, 

the tourney pitted the top 1 I teams 
from last year's Division III National 
Championships. 

The Triton golfers, basking in the 
sun and relishing the free food and 
accommodations, made a strong 
showing during the three-&y affair, 
vaulting themselves inlO a fourth-place 
tic with team totals of 315,309 and 
298. Methodist o,llege grabbed top 
honors, shooting a 303, 29S and 304 
over the course of the tourney. 

"fbis was a very special tourney 
for us to be able to attend," UCSD 
Head Coach Mike Wydra said. "Nor-
mally, we can't go (to this tbuma-
ment] because it falls on the week of 
finals." 

Taking full advantage of the early 
season playing opportunity, veteran 
Arnie Campbell led thecbarge for the 
Tritons. After slipping with an 81 on 
the first day of play, Campbell recov-
ered with a pair of 74 's during the 
final two days of competition. 

Campbell's consistency earned 
him a tie for 13th place in the indi-
vidual standings. On his Iast- three 

holes, Campbell proved 10 be a clutch 
performer, knocking in 3O-foot, 20-
foot and IS-foot puUI. 

"Arnie is a stud, " Wydra said. "At 
6'1" and 200 [Ibs.), his gravitational 
power, and driving power, is 
emmensc." 

The second-best team finisher for 
UCSD was a surprise of sorts. Brian 
Bazzel, a second-year transfer from 
Palomaro,mmunityCollege,no&ched 
a n-80-n to earn 29th-place and 
solidify his spot on the Triton team. 

"When [Bazzel] first joined the 
team, he was what I call 'Rll' -
resistant to instruction," Wydra said. 
"Now, he'sopcn to my ideas, and he's 
doing really well." 

Tying Bazzel in the individual 
standings was teammate Greg 
Uberuaga, who shot a 78-81-75. 

"[UberUaga) wasn't that good last 
ycar,buthecamebadtwithavengence 
this year," Wydra said. 

In typical comeback fuhion, 
Uberuaga did not hit a single green in 
regulation through his fUlll 12 holes, 
but he c:onnected each time on his 
final 14 holes of play.

Tritons Bully Toms 
'RNALE: UCSD ended its regular season with a 1-0 victory over 
Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills, to finish 14-2-0 
8ySUnRehlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team ended its regular season Fri-
day afternoon on a high note, de-

feating Division \I 
foe Cal State 
Dominguez Hillson 
the road, 1-0. 

Friday's game at 
Dominguez Hills 
was originally set 
for Thursday, but it 
had to be moved up 

a day due to conflicting schedules. 
Furthermore, UCSD's contestver-
sus Cal State San Bernardino was 
canceled because of similar 
scheu ling difficulties. 

Peer found herself with the ball 
right in front of the penally box, 
and she promptly put it past the 
Taros' goalkeeper and into the 
emptynet. 

"The ball bounced around and 
ended up at my feet, so I just turned 
and shot," Peer said. " I was in the 
right place at the right time." 

"[Dominguez Hills] was a tough 
place to play," Triton Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. "They are a 
very physical team, and you could 
see it in the game. Whenever we 
got the ball and laid off, they would 
still follow through and take a dig 
at you." 

" Apart from the first half when 
they had a two or three of shots, 
we controlled the game," he added.

play their first play-
off game in the 
NCAA playoffs here 
at Triton Soccer Sta-
dium on Wednesday 
afternoon. 

That game will be 
against archrival 
California Lutheran 
University. If it 
wins, UCSD will 
have to travel to Mis: 
souri for the regional 
round of competi-
tion. The host team 
from Washington 
University would be 
the Tritons first op-
ponent in regionals. 

Monday, October 30.1995 

Knowing this would be their last 
regular-season game, the Tritons 
came out fired up. Senior defender 
Carrie Peer put her team on the 
board with a score at the 30:00 mark, 

UCSD dominated the rest of 
the way, not allowing the Toros to 
get off a single shot. The Tritons' 
control of the game was evidenced 

"Obviously, we 
would ' ve loved to 
have [regionals]

Again, the visitors regained the 
lead, when the UCSD defense 
miscommunicated and allowed an 
open shot from two meters. But Nalu 
ended the quarter with his third goal 
of the game, which gave both sides 
six goals apiece. 

Defense dominated the third pe-
riod, and for the first 5:35, neither 
side could get anything going.

point of the game, and the most 
. damaging as far as the Tritons were 

concerned. UCLA managed two 
fast-break goals to end the period. 

"Those were two rather pooriy 
executed moments," Harper said. 
" UCLA was leaning towards the 
attacking goal; they got the ball, and 
it was off to the races." 

The Bruins used their newly 
found momentum to score another 
goal to open the final period, giving 
them the9-6edge. The Tritons ended 
the streak when Kudirka, trapped by 
a double team in frontofthe visitor's 
goal, managed to kick the ball out to 
a wide-open Giulianotti for a score. 

However, L.A. came back with 
two more goals to lead 11-7 with

"We're ranked number-one in 
the west and number four in the

lous that we have to playa game 
on Wednesday, but that's the wis-
dom of the NCAA. As long as

2:03 remaining. At that point, the 
game was seemingly oul of reach. 

UCSD came back nicely, though, 
with Carlos De La Berra scoring 
from the far left to pull the team to 
within three. Then, after stopping 
the Bruins, Crass single-handedly 
created a score, when he swift ly 
maneuvered around a defender for 
the open shot.fJltheTritons needed

That opportunity never arose, 
however. The Bruins managed to 
hold on to the ball until time ex-
pired, despite heavy pressure. 

"Even after losing, we're still 
focused," Harper said. "Westill have 
USC and Irvine to play on the road, 
We're going to stay positive."

"We're used to [the unfair 

seedings]," Peer said. "Everyone 
wan!s us to lose, and everyone 
wants us to fail. II gives us an 
incentive, a bit of strength going 
in. We' re going to kick ass any-
way." 

That strong attitude has been a

team of the 90's and are quite wor-

That title was granted to the 
Braves by right fielder David Jus-

final game - he turned on the 
first offering from a Cleveland

causing the din of the fans to

time around as well, because 
NCAA scheduling quirks will 
force the highly ranked Tritons to 
spend the playoffs traveling around 
the country. 

"The NCAA would rather have 
the few west coast teams travel to 
the east than to have the many east 
coast teams travel to the west," 
Mc Manus said. "That's the way 
the NCAA financing works." 

His blast turned out to be the 
game and championship winner, 
but it was merely indicative of the 
incredible series that had just con-
cluded. 

For all those so-called, ex-fans 
of the game who failed to tune in 
for this one - its your loss. I hope 
you can forgive America's game 
for its sins because in today ' s 
money-oriented world, baseball 
will undoubtedly be rocked by the 
disruptive undercurrent of finan-
cial matters. 

If you cannot look past the 
sports' misgivings, you will never 
again have the opportunity to en-
joy its beautiful moments, such as 
this year's World Series.

Baseball's 'Fall 
Oassic' is Back 

It was just what the doctor 
ordered - the perfect cure for 
the ultimate problem plaguing 
professional sports. The 
problem was the lack of fan 
interest in "America 's 
pastime" and the cure ... The 
1995 Major League Baseball 
World Series. 

Tritons Earn 01 Triumph, 2·1 
WIN OUT: UCSD captured wins in its last two games of the year against Westminster and UC Irvine 

This year's series was 
indeed a "faU classic," 
bringing back the memories of 
roaring stadiums under the 
starry skies from Octobers 
put. It will be forever 
remembered, if only for the 
fact that it was probably the 
best series in recent memory to 
be watched by nobody. 

Sure, the parks in Cleve-
land and Atlanta were packed 
with local fans eager to see 
their teams' championship 
slumps broken - Atlanta's 
Braves were the team of the 
90's, but had no title to show 
for it. Cleveland's woes were 
so well-known that they had 
inspired a rather uninspiring 
pair of movies. But the 
television audiences more 
often turned off than tuned 
in. 

They may come to regret 
this blunder, however, because 
this series was certainly worth 
the fans' attention. Five of the 
six games ended with.a mere 
run separating the combatants. 
Home runs were the norm in 
clutch situations. 

By Prentice NI 
Guardian Reporter 

Finishing the regular season on a 
roll was an important goal for the 
UCSD men's soccer team. The Tri-

tons could not have 
put things together 
any better, as they fin-
ished the season un-
beaten in their last 
eight games, includ-
ing two victories this 
pas't week versus 

• ~~- Westminster (UT) 
and Division I rival UC Irvine. 

At Anteater Stadium yesterday 
afternoon, UCSD slipped past UCI 
in overtime by a score of 2-1, im-
proving its record to 11-5-2. 

Irvine jumped on top of the Tri-
tons early in the rust half, tallying a 
goal in the 12th minute to give the 
Anteaters a 1-0 lead. 

UCSD came back with a goal of 
its own, however. Nate Hetherington 
notched an unassisted score from 35 
yards out, knotting the contest at 
one. The game remained tjed 
throughout the rest of the half. 

After a scoreless second half, 
both teams went on to playa scorc;-
less 15 minutes of overtime. The 
Tritons struck gold at the 116 minute 
mark, whenjunior Jose Ocampo took 
a pass from senior Nick Terleeky 
and put UCSD up for good with the 
eventual game-winner. 

YIIi«N Zolotorev/Guanlillfl 

Up and over: UCSO senior defender Matt Chilton (top) hurdles an 
attacker during the Tritons'· 5-1 domination of Westminster. 

"We have a good shot at having 
home-field advantage for NCAA 
Regionals," senior defender Matt 
Chilton said. "We've been success-
ful at home; and the whole atmo-

sphere, the cro~d, the field, every-
thing works in our favor." 

UCSD showed its home-field 
prowess on Friday night, as the Tri-
tons steamrolled past NAJA foe 

Westminster College, 5-1. 
The game, from beginning to end, 

was all UCSD; and nearly all of it 
was played on the Parsons' half of 
the field, witli the Westminster 
goaltender feeling the brunt of a 
well-tooled UCSD offense. 

The scoring started in the 16th 
minute when Hetherington juked a 
defender and crossed the ball to Erik 
Waldman. Waldman promptly one-
timed the pass into the top-right 
corner to put UCSD up, 1-0 . 

The Tritons doubled their lead in 
the 29th minute when junior Brian 
Turner crossed the ball to Waldman, 
who slid it over to Hetherington. It 
took Hetherington a split second to 
collect the pass' and crank a shot 
from inside the goalie's box - a 
score which put UCSD up 2-0. 

UCSD notched yet another score 
a brief two minutes later, when a 
corner kick by Ocampo made its 
way to Chilton after dredging 
through the chaos in front of the 
goalie's box. Chilton popped it in 
from close range to stake the Tritons 
to a commanding 3-0 lead. 

Westminster finally showed 
signs of life a minute after UCSD's 
goal, when the Triton defense broke 
down and allowed Parson defender 
Kris Hamlet to streak across the top 
of the goalie box. From his position 
18 yards out, Hamlet pushed a shot

Defensive plays were 

executed with such precision 
and athleticism that even I, a 
novice baseball fan at best, 
was amazed by the beauty of it 
all. 

Bruins Squeak By Resurgent Tritons 
When Omar Vizquel 

scooped a hard-hit ball in the 
sixth game, shoveled it 
straight from his glove to 
short-stop Carlos Baerga who 
barehanded it, wheeled and 
fired a rocket down the line 
to first to complete a picture-
perfect double play, I felt like 
jumping to my feet. And I'm 
an A's fan. 

BEAR CLAW: #3 UCLA strengthens its bid for number-one by edging eighth-ranked UCSD, 11-9 

This series had character. 
It had panache. It had the 
notoriously woeful Indians

grocery bags on their heads

Nearly 1,000 people turned out 
at the Canyonview pool on Sunday 
night to watch a showdown between 

~~. two of the nation's 
top water polo teams. 

Perennial power-
house UCLA (11-4) 
was ranked third in 
the nation, fresh off 
victories over top-
ranked UCBerkeley,

eighth-ranked Tritons (12-10) were 
equally hot, riding a nine-game win-

over UCD and Air Force. Some- . 
thing had to give. 

In a tight affair, the Bruins bested

Coach Denny Harper said of the 
visitors. "Going in,l was afraid that 
they might run away with it." 

In the first two minutes, it looked 
as though Harper's worst fears 
were going to be realized. The 
Bruins took advantage of early 
Triton sluggishness to post a 3-0 
advantage with 5:07 still remain-
ing in the first quarter. 

But, the home team refused to 
lie down and die. Triton stalwart 
Mike Nalu ignited the crowd, 
when he received a pass from 
John Giulianotti and netted the 
Tritons' first goal from the two-
meter position. 

The Bruins responded with a 
skip-shot from the left wing, but 
UCSD matched the goal when 
Romas Kudi rka scored on a Nalu 
assist. The teams exchanged 
goals again to end the period -
