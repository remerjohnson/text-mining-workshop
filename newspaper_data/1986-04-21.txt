Limited access 

Federal information 
becoming less public 
By SUZANNE lIFSON. Assodate News Editor 

Consequences of the confidentialiry of Federal Governmental 
information was the topic at a UCSD colloquium titled. "Federal 
Restrictions on Access to Information: Implications for Scholarship 
and Research," It was jOintly sponsored last Wednesday by the 
Librarians' Association at UCSD, the department of History, 
Political Science and Sociology and the California Space Institute, 

The discussion. moderated by Peter Irons of the Political Science 
department. included three guest speakers:John ShattUck, a former 
lawyer for the American Civil liberties Union and currently vice-
president of Harvard; Dr. Anna Nelson. an historian at American 
University and Anne Heaneu, Associate Director of the American 
library Association; all of whom fear the effects of the unavailability 
of Federal facts . 

Shattuck opened the meeting by explaining the historical 
background of free speech and stressed the importance of the 
American priviledge of access to various types of information. He 
quoted President Madison as saying that "popular information was 
bound to end in a farce and/ or tragedy." 

Shattuck also mentioned that the creation of the bureau of labor 
Statistics around the late 19th century, which made its information 
public. was partly responsible for the creation of the Federal 
Depository library System. This system depOSits copies of 
designated documents at specific deppsitory libraries like UCSD's 
Central library. 

From a Federal Government researcher's perspective, the 
present government information policy has hindered research 
progress, Nelson said. 

Nelson cited the positive precedent set in 1972 during President 
Richard Nixon's administration which intended the public release 
of federal information after 25 or 30 years of secrecy. 

A problem Nelson sees is the complete faith in computers. Much 
data Is now stored in computers which in the furure, could become 
lost or unavailable. 

Nelson said that computer directories are not as organized nor 
dependable as paper files are. and floppy discs. where much 
Federal Government information is stored, only have a life 
expectancy of five to ten years. 

Heaneu said that the Federal Government abolished public 
access to the House and Senate document rooms and for the past 
five years. has trie.d to terminate the existence of the Federal 
DepOSitory library System. Heaneu mentioned other disturbing 
rrends. including the privitization of government document 
publishing. 

Heaneu stated that in order to combat this problem on a personal 
level, one must tell legislators about concerns, and one must 
complain to Federal agencies about unavailable data.

Paying for the AS Council's blunders 
And now for ~mething completely different: AS elections coverage, 
You would thmk that $3,000 and almost a year of planning would be 

enough to organize a simple student election, but with our AS nothing is so 
simple that it can't be blundered. Last week's electoral travesty has been 
declared invalid amid a fluny of charges citing election mismanagement and 
unpenalized campaign violations. Only one of the charges has been reviewed 
by either the AS Elections Committee or the AS Judicial Board, and it has been 
enough to negate the entire vote - more than I,ODO students were denied the 
right to vote because their fees had yet to be processed by the Cashier's Office. 

.• ''The otner charges, which include campaign violations by several incumbant 
councilmembers, have yet to be addressed or, as far as we know, even 
discussed by the Judicial Board. We hope these won't be conveniently ignored . 
because a new election has been called. 

Such instances of mismanagement explain why the credibility of our AS has 
taken a nosedive . It is no wonder only 25 percent of the student body votes, 
and qualified students balk at the idea of running for office. ' I Not only will students be forced to shell out another couple of thousand to 

r 

hold this second .election during the fifth week, but the candidates will be 
forced to ride out their campaigns once again, spending precious academic 
hours of which the quarter system grants us so few. During the first campaign, 
slates and individual candidates were allowed to spend $6DO and $125, 
respectively. Another campaign forces them to shell out additional funds. 
Several of the original candidates can't afford to spend the money or the time 
to run in another election , and they may be forced to drop out; thus, the 

wealthier, more conservative candidates, have a ~eater opportunity to assume 
office than the progressives, who tend to be less economically apt. 

The question still remains: why was this allowed to happen? T!te AS 
designed a committee whose sole purpose is to run elections. Didn't anyone 
on the committee think to call the Cashier's Office? Fees weren't due until 
Thursday of the first week, three working days before the election. Obviously 
every check could not be processed in that short a time. The new AS 
constitution declares, that elections are to be held during the second week of 
Spring Quarter - a ridiculous requi~ement that gives candidates only a week 
to campaign and turns the whole affair into a confuSing blob of T-shirts, 
slogans and posters. There's nowhere near enough time for students to know 
who or what they are voting for. Our AS elections have turned into high school 
politiCS; they are filled with saruration campaigning, unrealistic promises (like 
the CAST slate that promised to lower· the drinking age) and cute animal acts. 
The few good candidates who have something valuable to say or have worthy 
ideas are never given the opportunity to rise above plastic slates. 

Now the AS is asking students to get our there and vote once again, to show 
their support and confidence in their government and to voice their concerns 
and make a difference. The candidates and referenda will be the same but the 
mood will surely be different It is hard to take inept organizers seriously. 

We at the Guardian encourage all students to vote once again . Do so with a 
grain of salt and with the realization that you may be able to elect a 
competent AS that will never let something like this happen again.

What "Bro" knows 
Editor: 

I am writing in regard to your 
policies concerning the 
candidates of th e past A.S. 
election. Being the only sc hool 
newspaper, the GuardIan has a 
monopoly, of forcing thei r 
opmion on the students. It I 
-true that the candidates each 
had space to be fairly 
represented 10 your paper, but 
that ..... as meaningless when In a 
couple pages later the Guartlian 
played father to the school and 
elected John Riley. 

I am not saying that free 
speech should not have the right 
to endorse a candidate. I am 
saying that when free speech by 
rhe minority can have such an 
impact as the GuardlQn then that 
power should be examined. 

Great men earn rheir 
mfluence, but where did the 
small group of people such as 
the GuardlQn earn theirs? 
Certainly, It IS nor 'by bemg the 
only non-biased paper ar UCSD. 

opinions on Greg McCambridge. 
Listening and talking to all the 
candidates, to me Greg had the 
right experience mixed with 
more importantly the nght 
thinkmg frame whic h would 
represent the students. This was 
my opinion. It relieves me that I 
did not have the power to 
influence all the students, unlike 
the Guardllln . 

Jill Li£schiz. 
Afte r reading your editorial, it 

behooves me ro respond to your 
concerns. 

First, I must start by making it 
perfectly clear that I am most 
familiar with the position of Vice 
President Finance. As a 
candidate for this posi ti on, it is 
not necessary for me to 
acquiesce to your demands. 
Fulfilling the position does not 
require my having a personal 
interview with the individual 
presently holding the specific 
office. 

is, then you are right. I, however 
feel that accomplishments speak 
louder than words. I, in my one 
year term, have started the 
workings of a student bank or 
student credit union. This may 
not be a political job, but it is 
still the better student 
government you spoke of. I have 
also pushed for the growth of 
student businesses such as the 
coops in many ways. I have even 
attempted to Start one myself 

I ran in the presidential 
election. I personaly believed the 
Guardian was right, I did nor 
have enough experience. 
However, I disbelieved their

Student centered news 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to 
your Opinions article of April 7 
and 14 and in response to the 
article by Elina [sic) Caprio on 
the University Cemer. The 
Guartlian seems to cominually 
overlook those studems who 
have proven themselves as hard 
workers who use their 
experience for the better of 
studems in general. As you said 
in both articles, "There are few, if 
any, able candidates aiming to 
create better student 
government: If bei.ng a political 
person is what a good candidate 

Furthermore, as commissioner 
of the University Center, I have 
worked extensively for 
maintaining a student-owned 
and -operated University Center. 
I have worked on the design of 
the building and have put in 
many hours on the many food 
services which will be available. 
The Guartlian, however, ignores 
the student initiative and input 
by, of and for students. This was 
proven in the April 14 article by 
Ellin [sicl Caprio. She totally 
ignored the students' side of the 
new center by only showing the 
administrative viewpoint and 
what the administration thinks 
and feels about the University 
Center. Students have put in 
many many hours of work for 
the center and should be given 
recognition for this, There was 
even an interview that was 
granted me by the Guartlian in 
which I expressed this point. It 
was left out of the article 
altogether. 

Respect for student input and 
initiative must first come from 
the students. If the students 
overlook other students and 
don't suppon each other, then 
how is the administration

actions such as the killing of

that Americans are willing to die The sole opposition 
for their govemment(s). Gi~n 
the careful policy of unleashing 
dis information campaigns upon 
the public during times of crisis, 
this belief of the Pentagon's may 
not be far fetched . Now that 
important public information is 
increasingly being labelled as

Take, for instance, the 
bombing of Libya last week. The 
White House and their affiliates 
like the San Diego Union 
misinformed the public that .. 
intelligence services had 
irrefutable evidence that the 
Libyan embassy in East Berlin 
had engineered the bombing . of. 
the discotheque in West Berlin . 
InteUignece services claimed that 
hey had intercepted a cable from 
the East German-based Libyan 
embassy that gave the go-ahead 
to the people who launched the 
terrorist raid. But, where IS that 
cable, and why is it that the 
West German government 
delayed for so lo~g its. support of 
the White House s claIm? 

Most likely. it is because 
Khadaffi disorganized shabby

with the bombing. Let us be 
serious here. To go along with 
President Reagan's analysis of . 
"the existence of a world terronst

Our campus is gearing up to 
move, once again, against those 
people who are ruining the 
ethical fabric of our once 
democratic nation. This week 
will mark the first time since last 
spring that a broad coalition of 
students will get together to 
protest in justice at home and 
abroad. Beginning with the much 
needed appearance of jesse 
jackson on Revelle Plaza 
Tuesday, various stude~ts and 
community members Wlll be . 
roaming the campus :equesllng a 
beginning of a new dialectical 
process amid the concerned 
people of UCSD. 

As we are nearing the end of 
the school year , we must reflect 
on what we have accomplished 
in the way of affecting our ?W" 
lives and the life of the nallon. 
We have not stopped the 
increased militarism on campus, 
we have not halted our student 
body's apathetic skid , we have 
not even gotten along very well 
as individuals. But very soon, my 
friends, we will be seeing our 
loved ones shipped off to fight 
some war that is not ours to

Ubya, Nicaragua, El Salvador or 
South Korea; or are defending 
this administration's puppet-
government in South Africa, ou~ 
buddies may be coming home an 
body bags before this decade 
comes to an end. 

Why, may I ask, do we. 
continue to grease the skids of 
the war ideology? I would 
venture to say that it is because 
we are afraid to speak out 
against any institution with more 
"formal· power than we have 
ourselves. But remember what 
happened to the ~arco.s

A presidential apology 
Editor: 

In my letter to the edito~ 
printed in last Thursday's Issue 
of the Guardian, I inaccurately 
Stlted that Matthew J. Cronin 
was a non-student. I stand 
corrected as he has been 
concurrently enrolled this year 
and is a student this quarter. I 
apologize for this error.

AS President 

Necessary functions 
Editor: 

I would like to comment on an 
editori.al in the Guardian on April 
7 by Christopher M. Schnaubelt 
and the subsequent editor's note. 
I agree with Schnaubelt's 
statements. AlI9wing 
organizations such ~s the 
militlry, Secret SeTVlce, ClA, FBI 
and INS the free use of the 
Career Services Center does not 
infringe upon the rights of any 
student. Although the military 
does d iscriminate against 
homosexuals, the military does 
not discriminate against women 
in the like manner. Women may 
join the military (unlike 
homosexuals) , but are prevented 
from entering certain duties. 

For your reply to Mr. 
Schnaubelt's letter, you seem to 
concern yourself with the COst of 
the space used in the Career 
Services Center by these 
organizations during rec~anent 
operations as weD as the nme of 
the center's staff. I ask you three 
questions: 1) ls the value of the 
aforementioned costs greater 
than the value oblained by the 
students who join these 
organizations in addition to the 
value of the service these 
students provide to our great 
country? 2) What is the cost of 
the use of the center. IS heat, 

Women need 
not apply. 

Not long ago, it was almost unthink-
able for women to attempt to become 
lawyers. law was a male-dominated. pro-
fession, and the only women aSSOCiated 
with it worked as secretaries_ These are 
more enlightened times, however, and we 
are proud that now about 40% of the stu-
dents in National University School of Law 
classes are women. We are equally proud 
that we are helping these bright, ambi-

tious women realize their dream of enter-
ing the legal profession. 

To apply for admission to the National 
University School of Law, call Dean Irene 
Jacobsen at 492-5100 for ~ur personal 
counseling appointment By the way-men 
can apply, too.

these organizations, as the stlff

As Mr. Schnaubclt stated, these 
organizations "perform nec.e~saty

which protect all citizens -
men, women, heterosexuals and 
homosexuals alike. We should 
not deny the opportunity 
provided by the militlry, Secret 
Service, GA, FBI and INS to 
STUdents due to the obvious 
minute costs involved which 
enable students to contribute to 
the security of our country and 
others around the world. 

Mark A DeROIICh 

Reacting to opp~ssion 
Editor: 

So far this year, the issue of 
Apartheid has been a ouIr 
outstanding one in the man~s ~f 
most students. The oppression an 
South Africa must end, and it is 
the hope of many Ameri~s that 
a Democratic government IS 
established. 

I would like, however, to 
dedicate this letter to the 
forgotten victims of oppression 
that the majority of us have 
overlooked. 

As I write this letter, the B'hai 
population of Iran is .being 
systematically eradicated by the 
Islamic government. It's such a 
shame that there is no public 
reaction here. It reminds me of 

the six million Jews who were 
killed by the Nazis in World War 
\1. Then, as well as now, 
Americans have closed their eyes 
and pretended that such 
barbarism doesn't exist. 

Since 1968, a state of 
emergency has been in effect in 
Syria and absolutely no freedom 
exists whatsoever. In February 
1982. the Syrian army ~ntered 
the city of Hama and klUed 
twenty thousand innocent men, 
women, and children. Horrible 
tales of torture in Syrian prisons 
have surfaced. These people 
have also been overlooked by 
colleRe students in this country. 

The 4.5 million people who 
live in Israel have to endure the 
daily threat of war from 100 
million hostile enemies who have 
vowed to destroy them. As usual , 
there is no reaction on the 
college campus. 

Here is a more comprehensive 
list of man's inhumanity to man: 

1) The Genocide of the 
population of Cambodia by 
Pol Pot and now the 
Viemamese. 
2) The threatened 
extermination of Nigeria's lbo 
tribe. 
3) The indiscriminated 
murder of Kurds by the 
regimes of Syria. Iraq. Iran, 
and Turkey. 
4) The persecution of the 
jewish populations of the 
Soviet Union, Syria, Iran, and 
Nicaragua. . 
As important as the end of 

Apa!Jheid is, we must not forget 
others who have it just as bad 
or even worse than the Blacks in 
South Africa.

"We didn't realize how many 
students were affected by this 
until 1:00 Wednesday (April 9), 
Bitto said . 'We knew some 
students weren't on the list, but 
assumed they would be able to 
go and pick up their stickers." 

Jelger Kalmijn filed a formal 
protest of election 
mismanagement last Monday. 
The charges include election 
fraud, improperly trained and 
biased poll workers, last-minute 
distribution of misleading 
campaign material, destruction of 
campaign materials and the 
ineligibility of students to vote. 

Bitto maintlins that she ran a 
fair and valid election . 

"' was solely responsible for 
the banOl boxes: Bitto said. "I 
had a police escort whenever 
they were moved , they were 
opened by the county 
registration office and SUDS had 
an observer in the counting 
room. There is no way in my 
mind that the elections were 
fraudulent." 

In response to the charge that 
poll workers were improperly 
trained and biased, Bitto said 

Monday, Aei121, 1986 7 
NEWS 

that the elections committee 
notified an organizations who 
were sending poll workers that 
there was a meeting on April 7 
to train the officials. 

"From year to year it's always 
the same organizations that 
participate in the elections," Bitto 
said. "Bias or no bias isn't a real 
issue. The poll workers aren't 
connected with the candidates; 
they're not pro or con. They are 
insoucted not to say Vote for so-
and-so' and even if they wanted 
to, they are so busy they don't -
have time to. 

"The elections committee, 
including myself, watched all the 
booths. And as for the Greeks 
who partiCipated, they have 
always participated ," Bitto said.

about misleading campaigu 
materials. Bitto said , "The people

no other graduate school of this 
nature currently existing in the 
UC system. There are only three

international relations existing

Music-
fest 
Con tinued from page 3 

The fcsti val's divided into four 
themes; collaboration , extensions 
(the extended use of instruments 
or voice), ensembles, and 
technology, which has a special 
night all to itself, according to Ed 
Harkins. vice chairman of the 
music depanment at UCSD. 
Under each theme guests, faculty 
and students will perfonn 
appropriate pieces in accordance 
with the theme. 

Student concens are a very 
important pan of the Pacific 
Rin g Festival, according to 
Harkins. ·We made th ree student 
committees which mirrored the 
th e mes of the festival and 

assigned cenain students to be 
in charge of the entire 
produc tion of their concen," said 
Harkins. 

The first show is comprised of 
a group called THE. "THE 
consists of Ed Harkins and Phil 
Larson (a UCSD music professor) 
who are claSSically trained 
musicians. I have been involved 
in extended trumpet techniques 
and Larson has been involved in 
extended vocal techniques," 
Harkins said . This concen 
goes beyond purely music. There 
is some element of what people 
call c reative and a lot of interest 
and concern with movement and 
visual things on stage," stated 
Harkins . 

Joining Harkins and Larson is 
John C age, holder of the Legion 
of Honor and p robably the 
premier avant-garde anist, and 
T oru T akemitsu, who composed 
the music for the Japanese film , 
RAN.

Learning to live with 
chronic mononucleosis 
By STEVE TATROW 

T WO YEARS ago, Steve Wayne was a healthy athletic UCSD student He 
was raking a full class load, 
getting good grades, and playing 
on intra-mural teams in three 
spons. 

Today he has to rest after 
climbing a flight of stairs; he 
can't run 20 yards; and for every 
hour he is active , he must rest 
two. 

Wayne is plagued by Chronic 
Epstein-Barr virus or CEBV, the 
same virus that causes infectious 
mononucleosis, hepatitus-A and 
a myriad of other diseases. Wayne's 
disease is non-contagious and 
incurable, affiicting him with 
symptoms that r-.mge from slight 
fatigue and mild headaches to 
debilitating fatigue , severe 
headaches, fever, mental lapses, 
depression, body aches and 
painful hypersensitivity to light 
and sound. 

Since CEBV was first 
diagnosed in 1980 by Dr. James 
Jones at the University of 
Arizona's College 0: Medicine, 
the words "chronic 
mononucleosis" have provided 
thousands of previously 
misdiagnosed sufferers with a 
name for their disease . Before 
this discovery, chronic mono 
sufferers were usually treated for 
massive mental depression, often 
being referred to psychiatrists 
which seldom improved their 
condition. 

"When you feel this bad for 
months," says Wayne, ' and you 
go to the doctors and they don't 
find anything wrong with you, 

your next thought is suicide. So 
just learning of a name for my 
disease made me feel a lot 
better." 

Chronic mono usuaDy begins 
as infectious mono, with an 
estimated one out of every 
10,000 cases of infectious mono 
becoming chronic. No one 
knows why cenain individuals 
with infectious mono develop 
this lingering, non-fatal form of 
the disease, but it is first 
detected when mono-like 
symptoms persist even after tests 
for infectious mono are negative. 

When Wayne's infectious 
mono tests first came up 
negative, his doctor asked him if 
he was depressed about 
anything: school, girls, anything 
at all; or if he was smoking 
marijuana regularly or taking any 
other drugs. Wayne replied "No," 
and promptly changed doctors 
in exasperation. His next doctor 
performed all th e same tests as 
his previous one, then shook her 
head and handed Steve a 
photocopy of an article from that 
month's edition of Modem 
Medicin" which told of Dr. Jones' 
revolutionary diagnosis. 

Wayne dropped out of school 
and srnt the next rwo months 
in be , hoping tQ enable his 
weakened body to fight the virus, 
but his condition did not 
improve. He tried megadoses of 
vi tamin C, and his doctor 
prescribed a new DNA 
preparation that had proven 
effective against certin other viri 
in the herpes family - of which 
Epstein-Barr is believed to be a 

member - but all to no avail. 
Gradually, Wayne began to 

learn to endure the symptoms 
and how to avoid aggravating 
them. Physical exertion makes 
the symptoms worse, so he 
became very conscious of his 
energy expenditure, limiting his 
activities to only those he 
deemed most essential, like 
eating and hygiene. 

Giving up sports was hard, 
since Wayne had played hockey 
since he was six and also 
lettered in soccer and tennis in 
high school; but he had no 
choice - sometimes just the 
effort of digesting a big meal 
would leave him too weak to get 
out of bed. So now when he has 
energy and wants to feel 
productive, Steve substitutes less 

taxing activities like cooking and 
cartooning for athletics. 

Overall, Wayne says he is 
improving, and he doesn't feel 
really lousy as often or for weeks 
on end like he did a year ago. 
This must be true, since now he 
is back at UCSD with half a class 
load. 

Wayne also says he has 
learned an imponant lesson from 
his illness: "Never delude yourself 
that you're in total control of 
your life, because something like 
this can come along and tum 
your whole world upside down." 

But there is hope. Two teams 
of Cambridge biologists have 
determined the complete genetic 
sequence of Epstein-Barr virus 
DNA, which is so far the largest 
Ii fe form to have its genetic blue 

print completely decoded. This 
is an imponant discovery 
because by understanding the 
DNA of Epstein-Barr, a method 
might be found that will prevent 
the virus from reproducing and 
causing diseases like CEBV. 

Also, a team at the University 
of North Carolina has recendy 
discovered three new drugs that 
have inhibited the reproduction 
of persistent Epstein-Barr viri in 
preliminary testS. Years of further 
testing will be necessary to 
determine whether one of these 
drugs is indeed a safe and 
effective treatment for CE8V, imd 
the odds are that will not be the 
case. But thousands or even tens 
or hundreds of thousands of 
sufferers like Wayne are crossi,!& 
their fingers. ~ 

Great expectations of life as a freshman 
By NINA BHOJWANI 

M y SENIOR year in high school was marked with expectation of what 
college life would be like. One 
thing was fo r sure , I was going to 
make my mark during thiS time 
- I was going to be somebody. 

So, I fed myself a dose of 
enthusiasm every day - you 
know, kind of like taking your 
Vltami ns. It gOt worse as the year 
came to a close. By this time, I 
had pumped myself so full of 

ope and spirit for the coming 
year that the special festivities of 
that time came to be regarded as 
dull and boring. 

But as the time drew near for 
everyone to part ways with 
family and friends , it became 
exceedingly clear that along with 
the excitement of going away, 
there would also be some 
emotional upheavaL This sure 
wasn't something I had 
bargained for and for awhile , 
anticipation took the back seat 
only to let doubt lead the way. 
Luckily, at just the right time, the 
dependable litde voice inside of 
me spoke up. "Take a positive 
attitude. You know you're JUSt 
going to Ioye independence. 
Remember, this is your big 
chancel" 

This was just what I needed, 
and all the thoughts of not 
leaving home and not going 

away to school were abandoned. 
Once again, I had myself 
convinced that I was in for the 
rime of my life . 

My main concern upon arrival 
at UCSD was my furure 
roommates. Living with three 
strangers could be quite a task 
and the little pessimist inside me 
surfaced to make me feel certain 
that I wouldn'r be liked. And for 
a while, I lived in fear that in the 
process of getting to know one 
another, some uncomfortable 
questions would arise such as: 
"Have you ever had sex?" or 
better yet "Aren't pelvic exams 
the worst?" Now don't get me 
wrong. It's not that I'm opposed 
to this sort of conversation, it's 
just that I've gotten caught in the 
trap of spilling my guts, so 10 
speak, to someone, and then 
never seeing the person again. I 
guess you could say I'm too 
trusting. 

But these girls turned out to be 
okay, even if we did get off to a 
rather shaky beginning. ActuaUy, 
the four of us could live quite 
well together at times. We 
tolerated each other and we 
cenainly did leam the meaning 
of the word patience. They put 
up with my little cleaning sprees 
and my need for quiet when I'm 
studying. In tum, I put up with 
having a six-foot inflatable 

Godzilla in our living room and 
the 3 am phone calls. This living 
arrangement was suitable and 
proVided for some very 
memorable and funny times. 

One day, around the fifth 
week into the first quarter, I was 
taking a shower. For some 
reason, I happened 10 look down 
at the bottom of the tub only to 
notice it was a dull black color. 
Hmmf. 1 wondered why I had 
never noticed this before. I 
consulted one of my -roommates 
about this latest discovery. 

"Oh God - it's supposed to be 
that way. You know, it's one of 
those protective things so we 
don't fall down and break our 
backs. Don'r sweat it," was her 
reply. 

"It's gOt 10 be dirt," I insisted. 
"Mmmff. So what if it is? No 

biggie: 
"But how can you live with 

things growing in the tub? More 
importantly, how can you bathe 
with gook in the tub?" 

'WiIl you JUSt stop it?! Who 
cares if there's junk in the tub? I 
don't mind bathing with 
company - besides, everything 
has a right to life." 

I could just teU this was a 
losing battle. But at least we 
became alerted to the concept of 
cleaning.

exercise , not to mention what I 
felt like the next day, and what I 
probably looked like , too. 

Unlike the rest of the year, so 
far the first day passed 
uneventfully. Armed with a pen, 
notebook and confidence, I had 
myself prepared 10 make the 
most of my classes. No matter 
how much confidence I 
displayed to the rest of the 
world, 1 wasn't sure if my 

nervousness and fear could be 
ooncealed. The truth of the 
matter was that I didn't want 10 
admit that I was new to this 
stuff. I had never felt so out of 
place in my life. Since I had no 
experience under my belt, I 
decided I would just have to fake 
it. 

My first plan of attack was to 
battle the crowds and somehow 
get to the front row. Maybe this 
way, I'd be noticed by tlie 

professor. But I soon discovered 
tha.t sitting right under the 
professor's nose wasn't such a 
WJod idea. 

This guy cenainly did have a 
problem controlling the 
whereabouts of his saliva as he 
lectured. Personally, I found this 
disgusting. I felt sorry for this 
guy's wife/girlfriend who was 
probably forced to endure this 
sort of sticky shower every time 
he uttered the words "I love you." 
At any rate, I'd lea~ the first row 
center seat for some other 
ambitious and enduring person. 

My next class passed just as 
uneventfully. There were only 
about 13 people in it and 1 had

improve my writing technique, 
and this is what I stated, 
perhaps too eagerly, wnen it was 
my tum to introduce myself and 
describe what I wanted out of 
this class. To my ~Ismay, this 
TA totaly misinterpreted my 
intentions because from that 
moment on, I was marked as a 
grade-hungry savage. Thereafter, 
every attempt I made to improve 
my work was further proof of my 
"hunger." 

I realized that I had an awful

place. The fact that I was a 
Freshman suddenly did not seem 
punishable by deam afrer I came 
10 the startling realization that 
there were many others who

hope for the future and the 
courage to recognize my many 
mistakes. No, I probablv wasn't

UCSD third baseman Dani Goodlet backhands a grounder against Claremont. 

Women's softball 
continues to roll 
By DEBBIE PAGE 

I F SATURDAY'S game against Claremont is any indication, the women's softball team 
seems to be back on the right 
ttack. Things only stayed 
interesting until the end of the 
fifth inning. After that, the 
Tritons took over for good, and 
they called the game in the sixth. 

The first inning was full of 
several hits for the UCSD 
women, and by the fourth inning 
the score saw a pitching change: 
after walking a few runners and 
with the bases loaded, coach 
White called freshman Karyn 
Escalante out of right field to 
replace freshman Choon Drew at 

the mound. Escalante perfonned 
well under the pressure of loaded 
bases, and UCSD squeezed 
through the inning giving up 
only two runs. 

That was really the last time 
the game was a close 
competition. In the fifth inning 
UCSD's outfield provided them 
with a double play, and along 
with a strike out by Escalante, 
they quickly took away 
Claremont's batting privelages. 

When UCSD came to bat, 
things became worse for 
Claremont With the help of a

A cold look at The Fall 
By KEN FURlE 

I WAS WALKING along near AP&M the other day, where these wooden slats are 
criss-crossed in the cement. 
Classes had just gotten out and I 
watched this guy come out of the 
bJilding. lOSS down his 
skateboard and jump on it as it 
was rolling. He kicked the 
ground, picked up speed and 
headed directly for me. 

I wasn't worried. These guys 
are pros, '1 thought But he wasn't 
paying attention and his 
skateboard CllCht on one of the 
wooden Oats. He flew. He sailed 
and he hit the dust right at my 
feet Some people stopped, one 
person Iaugned, anomer helped 
him up and asked him if he was 
okay. He was, although he was 
bleeding from his elbow, and he 
took off as soon as he could 
because of his embarrassment. I 

'f!i couldn't do a thing for him, not 
'Seven laugh - especiaUy laugh -
... I knew what it was like. 

I had been skiing. 
I called this particular fall of 

mine, this most eloquent and 
demonstrative fall, the Fabulous 
flying Furieflop. 

You have to under~nd the 
situation. My pals and I were 
going skiing. Not just skiing, but 
skiing for the first time outside 
of California, in Utah, for Pete's 
sake, on the most incredible 
snow in the world. We worked 
ourselves into a frenzy talking 
about it and almost died of 
exhaustion, disappointment and 
just plain crabbiness on the 16-
hour bus ride to Utah with RISC, 
the campus ski club. 

But we got there, and despite 
my cumulative sleep of about one 
hour, I was dead set and 
detennined to have a good ~me. 

I was ready. Man, I was ready. 
I had my bibs on, my long johns, 
my wool-polypropeline ski socks, 
my insulated gloves, my goggles, 
my new boots, my parka, a hat 
and even a blue bandana to keep 
the snow out of my mouth . I was 
ready. I couldn't wait. I hadn't 
skied so much last season and 1 
missed it. And there I was, in 
Utah, for Pete's sake, staring a 
huge resort in the face, with 
three feet of new snow. 
Waahoooo! 

I rode up the first chair with 

<O ro ... """" 

...,., .. "" .. 

my pal, Brian. 
"Damn cold out, huh Ken?" 
"What?" 
"Cold out. I said." 
"No shit." 
·You know what?" 
"What?" 
"I don't even CaR!" 
"Neither do II" 
"Waahooohoohooo'" we 

shouted, waking up whatever 
animals dw were within 
avalanche disl8nce. 

"Hey, check it out." 

"What?" 

b 
o 

"Check out that run , man," I 
pointed my pole at it. 

"Ohhhh, yes: he murmured 
appreciatively. 

We were looking at Heaven. 
Absolute Heaven. It was a fairly 
steep run; it didn't seem very 
steep at all, and it was covered 
from top to bottom with 
completely untouched, smooth, 
silky, clean, ultra-brite white 
virgin snow. 

"Damn," I mumbled, "look at 
that" 

After a moment I said, "I 
wonder what run it is." We had 
been too busy hurrying to bother 
to get a nail map. 

Well, we found out. The run 
was called "Widowmaker," and 
for a very good reason. 

We couldn't ski fast enough to 
keep ul,l with our hearts, and 
suddenly, there we were, at the 
crest and looking down. It was 
beautiful. Gorgeous. Unbelievable. 
It didn't reaBy look that tough. I 
had been around for awhile; I 
thought I could hack it, no 
problem. So did Brian. 

We Mre bach wrong. There 
was three feet of new powder on 
the slope. Powder. I was used to 
skiing on Southern California 
rock slopes, tearing up my skis, 
shaking my bones, but at least 
with something firm and solid 
under my feet. 

You have to understand. I'm a 

big guy. I'm 6'r, and about 230 
pounds. I have big bones and a 
big head to match. I need 
something solid under my feet to 
\ceep my balance, to keep from 
faIllitg over my own shadow. 
&lance is the key and I was 
more than accustomed to 
balancing on something solid, so 
accuswmed that I become visibly 
disoriented when I am not. And 
here I was, atop a fairly (hugely, I 
say now) steep slope of powder 
snow. Whoops! 

Brian went first. I followed 
very soon after, and I would give 
great amounts of money to see 
the look of surprise that must 
have been on our faces. We both 
took a faD some distance down. 

"Hey!" I shouted. "I can't steer 
in this muck'" 

"Neither can I!" 
We both thought for a minute . 

Firuily I said, "So this is fresh 
powderl" 

"Yep. This is it." 
"What do you think we ought 

to do?" 
"I guess you just have to keep 

going," my brilliant friend said. 
"Don't stop, just keep it going 
right down the mountain ." 

I was reluctant to get up again, 
because I had a sneaking feeling 
I wasn'tJoing to be good at this. 
But I di . So did he. We were 
about a third of the way down. 

"Let's go!" he took off. 
I pushed off tOO, and was 

immediately sorry. Powder snow 
makes body weight irrelevant. I 
triea to edge to the riKltt, and 
my skis didn't tum a bit; they 
just kept going. like Brian said, 
straight down the hill, only my 
body was leaning to the right 1 
tried to tum to the left. That was 
worse , I almost feU over because 
my legs didn't follow me. My skis 
had nothing to cut on. I didn't 
know how to move my legs. 

So I picked up speed. A lot of 
speed. I was 230 pounds of dead 
weight on a frictionless surface, 
with all the graviry and laws of 
physics on my side, hunling 
down the hill at the speed of 
light, praying to God I would die 
before my hea" burst with fear. 1 
didn't have to worry about 
hitting anything, at least. There 
was nothing there below me but 
more snow. Powder snow. 

Then it happened. My skis 
crossed. dug down instantly into 
the snow, three feet down, and 
stopped on a dime. I was out of 
my bindings withou~ feeling the 
release, and I was sailing through 
the air at a soukrushing

"Waahooohooo-
mmmphmmph!" I hit snow. Face 
first. It wasn't a swan dive, it was 
a nose dive, plowing my face 
with aU my weight and speed 
behind it, pushing my face into 
the snow. Brian later told me 
that it looked as if I had been 
Jaunchtd. 

I lay there for a second, 
grateful that I could even think, 
breathing in snow. It hadn't hurt. 
It was powder $now; it felt like 
falling face first into a feather 
heap. But it was cold. 

I got up. My goggles were 
down on my neck, and filled to

Triton Golfers fail 
to scare champs 
By DAVID TEDROW 
" GOLFERS BECOME 

mentally diseased: 
said UCSD golf coach 

Mike Wydra after his team fell 
apan at the UCI Tournament two 
weeks ago. The team had been 
playing consistently well all 
season long including wins in 
the Southern California 
Intercollegiate and USD 
Tournaments. Everything was 
going well and they went up to 
play in the UCI Tournament 
with the added incentive of 
playing against the defending 
Division m champs. Cal-State 
Stanislaus. The team wanted to 
scare Stanislaus a little before 
this year's National Tournament. 
From the way they played, 
Casper the Ghost would have 
been scarier (he would probably 
have shot better, too). 

The team shot a 36-hole total 
of 664, good enough for the 
coveted 12th place award , but 
not much to scare anybody with . 
It's hard to really fear a team that 
shoots 28 strokes worse than 
your team does. Pat Weishan, 
who had been averaging 73s and 
74s all seaoson, shot an 83-89. 
Joost Steenkamer was the only 
Triton to break 80 with an 80-79 
score. The tourney was played at 
Big Canyon Country Club which 
is a lOugh course, but not that 
tough. Basically, the team just fell 
apart. "It's hard to believe," was 

all Wydra could say about it. 
Later in the week, the team 

played at its home course at 
Torrey Pines against the San 
Diego Golf Academy, and only 
Steenkamer and Buddy Lea were 
able to break 80. The only bright 
Spot for the Tritons was 
Steenkamer's making medalist of 
the match with a 73,. At this 
point the entire team was 
playing poorly. led by Weishan 
who shot a lO-over·par 82 
against the Golf Academy. This is 
not the way the team wanted to 
go into its important match this 
past Friday against Redlands, a 
team they had to beat to go to 
Nationals. 

The match was again at Torrey 
Pines and the Tritons seemed to 
have gotten over their problems 
as they beat visiting Redlands by 
15 strokes. The charge back into 
top fonn was again led by 
Wei shan who had a one-under-
par 71 Friday. "I was in a mental 
slump for about two weeks when 
it was hard for me 10 concentrate 
on my game: said Weishan. The 
rest of the team broke out of 
their respective slumps also as 
Mike O'Laughlin shot a 74, Lea 
had a 76 and Steenkamer also 
broke !:() with a 77. "Once 
someone starts shooting well it 
catches on. Right now, we're 
starting to get pumped up for 
Nationals," said Weishan. ~

Sportswriting Contest DeadliD:e: May 1

, , 

The fall 
and let me' tell you, powder snow 
is no picniC to walk in. eithtr: It 
was hard work and every time I 
tried to step back into my 
binding, I1\Y skiS sun\< three feet 
down and rooted themselves. I 
ended up by heaving the damn 
things down the slope and 
tumbling myself after them, 
which almost suffocated Brian in 
his hysterics. 

Continued from page 16 . 
chest where it had gotten inside 
my c1others. I looked around, 
and down the slope was Brian, 
who had apparently SlOpped just 
a bit before my fall , since he was 
almost killing himself laughing. 

I looked up the slope and 
gasped. I'm not exaggerating 
when I say that my skis were at 
least 20 feet up the mountain. 
There was my trail , leading down 
raggedly to where my skis were 
buried, and there was 

So when that guy fell at my 
feet in front of AP&M, I guess 1 
didn 't say anything because I 
knew that he didn't want any 
help. He didn't want any more 
anention than he got for the fall 
itself; he didn't need concerned 
faces, bending over him, 
inquiring if he had injured 
himself in his clumsiness. 

Coach White was "able to play 
everybody and experiment with 
changing positions" during this 
non-league game. Coach White 
feels that to ensure themselves a 
trip to regionals they would 
"need to win the conference 
which means a win against ' 
Whittier." Their game against 
Whittier is April JO at Whittier. 
In the meantime, the team plays 
USD April 22 here, (at the Jewish 
Community Center field ), 
Occidental April 25 away, and 
Redlands April 26 at UCSD. ~ 

untouched, virgin snow, pure 
and clean as ever, all the way up 
to where I was standing in a 
great, huge gouging gash in the 
mountain . At least 20 feet, I 
thought to myself. 

Maybe I should have laughed, 
though. I could have laughed like 
my pal Brian and shook the 
snow ofT of this poor guy's red 
face. If Brian can laugh, so can I. 
I JUSt wish I could've seen it, 

Eventually I retrieved my skis. too. ~

Wanted: Student Participation 
in University Governance 

WHO? All undergraduate and graduate students who will 
attend the Universi[}' of California during the 1986-87 
academic year are elig\ble. 

WHAT? Students are needed to serve on several U.c. 
systemwide committees during the 1986-87 academic year. 
These are the committees with bigshot Chancellors and 
University Vice Presidents who make decisions in smoke-
filled backrooms affecting your education and life. Well, 
maybe not smoke filled backrooms, but unless students 
serve on these committees crucial input that could change 
the course of events will be missing. Policies affecting 
student fee levels, graduation requirements, quality of 
teaching, student housing, and other issues are determined 
by systemwide committees. 

WHERE? These committees meet throughout the state, 
but usually at Unviersity Hall in Berkeley. Student 
representatives are reimbursed for most costs associated 
with attending committee meetings. Committees meet 
monthly, quanerly or annually. 

HOW? To apply to serve on a systemwide committee, 
simply complete an application. Return it to your campus 
student government office or mail it to: UC Student Lobby, 
926 J Stree , Room 616, Sacramento, CA. 95814. No 
experience is necessary, so don't let anyone discourage you. 
An orientation in the fall will prepare you for your committee 
assignment. We are looking for conscientious individuals 
willing to attend all meetings and repon regularly to the UC 
Student Lobby and the University of California Student 
Association statewide student advocates. 

WHEN? May 2, 1986 is the initial deadline for 
applications. During May personal or phone interviews will 
be conducted and selections will be made by mid-June. 
Applicants will be notified of their status by July. Many 
additional appointments will be made in the fall for 
vacancies and new committee. So, if you miss the May 2 
deadline, you should still send in your application. 

WHY? There are many good reasons why you should 
apply: 1) We need you 2) You really can change the system. 
3) It will enhance your understanding of the system. 4) 
Student input is needed for the University Administration to 
make informed decisions and 5) Think of all the contacts 
you will make! I bet you can think of several other good 
reasons to apply - so do it. Now! 

FOR MORE INFO: If you have any questions or need more 
infonnation, contact your campus student government 
office or call the UC Student Lobby at(916) 442-3827, Mon-
Fri 8:30 am to 5 pm. Or Greg Arnold at ASUCSD 452-4450. 

Don't miss the deadline 
If you do, you will miss out on some great 

internship opportunities available through the AS 
Internship Office. Completed applications should 
be turned in by 3 pm on Friday, April 25. The Blake 
Agency, Continental American Management Corp., 
SAIC Comsystems, and the Union for 
Experimenting Colleges &: Universities are only a 
few of the new internships you will discover at ASIO.
