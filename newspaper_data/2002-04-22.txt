Muirstock rocks the house 
Free concert, food 
keep hundreds of 
students happy 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Six musical performances, hun-
dreds of UCSD students, free food 
and hllge inflatable devices trans-
formed the normally pristine John 
,\1uir College campus into a grand 
gala of rock music April 19. 

The activities were all part of 
the second annual Muirstock festi-
val, a free event staged by the Muir 
College Council. 

By noon Friday, students were 
already flying through the giant 
inflatable devices stationed juSt 
south of Sierra Summit. Crowds 
around the devices did not ease until 
late evening. A free barbeque was 
also popular with attendees. 

"However, it was the music that 
was the focus of the festival. Music 
blared from the two stages placed 
in the Muir quad from 4:30 p.m. 
until the festival's close at 9:30 p.m. 

Reggae openers The Rhythm 
Doctors played, giving way to 
headlining rockers Convoy. Other 
acts included UCSD-native emo-
popsters Straight No Chaser, ska-
masters Skapegoat and punk 
groups Larger Than Life and 
Sligarcuit.

Butcher cleared 
of all charges 
UCSD student ruled out a 
suspect in stabbing case 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

Sa nta Barbara and Mammoth 
Lake, Calif., authorities will not 
file charges against UCSD stu-
dent Peter Butcher, who was 
arrested earlier this month in 
connection with three syringe 
attacks, due to overwhelming evi -
dence indicating he was not in the 
area of the attacks when they 
occurred. 

On April 12, principle investiga-
tors from the Santa Barbara 
Sheriff's Department and District 
Attorney's office met with Butcher's 
atTorneys, who turned over all 
available evidence placmg thei r 
client in San Diego at the time of 
the Jan. 11 and April 5 attacks, both 
of which occurred in the Santa 
Barbara area. 

Butcher's attorneys convinced 
the investigators to delay filing 
charges until the evidence had been 
properly considered. 

Included in the evidence pre-
pared by Butcher's legal defense 
was a list of 17 witnesses who 
would vouch that Butcher was in 
San Diego at the time of both 
attacks. Documentation confirm-

ing his presence in Sa n Diego on 
the dates of the assaults wa~ 
released to investigatOrs, II1ciudinl{ 
a Jan. 11 credi t card receipt from 3 
La Jolla pharmacy. 

For the next weck, Santa 
Barbara police cond ucted poly-
graph examll1a tions of witness tcs-
timonv and confirmed the tIInc-
stamped documents to ensure the 
va liditv of the alibI. 

On April 18, thc Santa Barbara 
County Sheriff's Department 
cleared Butcher of the Santa 
Barbara attacks and apologized to

ethnic cuisine and viewed graphic 
presentations depicting the 
destrucpon in Jenin, Ramallah and

Attendees represented a diverse 
demographic slice of San Diego, 
from Kelly Hooker and his family 
from La Jolla, to Hamar HaJdad, a 
Palestinian C hristian and UCSD 
graduate. 

Some came due to invitations 
from friends, while others came to 
give financial support for 
Palestinians in Israel. Though per-
haps surprised by the dramatic 
representation of life in Gaza and 
West Bank and the strong push for 
contributions, guests seemed to

Lecture: 
The event raised over 
$100,000 in donations 
Continued from page 1 
Jnd decried the "~pa rtheid" in U.S . 
Jnd world histor)'. 

Likening Israel and Pal esti ne to 
Suuth Africa, ali- Yuseff said, 
"apartheid lea ds to conquest and 
con trol," implicating the Oslo 
PC.ICC Accord as part of the prob-
lem . 

During dinner, another set of 
preparations went into effect. 
UCSD administrators had planned 
the logistics of securi ty for the 
event. 

"IThe dinner] is a high-profile 
evem," said Tom Colley, the 
Operations Manager with the 
University Center department. "But 
security should be no problem. It's 
been very peaceful." 

At least two police officers and 
several Community Service 
Officers worked to protect the 
dozens of families and hundreds of 
individuals who were present at the 
fundraiser. 

While the officers watched and 
waited outside, the Muslims prayed 
inside. 

After prayers, guests listened as 
Anwar Khan from the Islamic Relief 
Organization called on those with 
freedom to fulfill their responsibility 
to use it to ease human suffering and 
to address this as a human issue rather 
than a small and isolated Palestinian 
Issue. 

Next on the itinerary were presen-
ta tions of the most recent events in 
Jenin and the work of the IRO in 
Palestine. 

Khan and Muslim community 
leaders then asked the audience for 
donations . The amount of verbal 
pledges totaled well over $100,000, 
with some iewelry contributed as 
well. 

According to Muslim Student 
Association sources, past fundraisers 
(such as those for Afghanistan and 
C hechnya) have seen immediate 
auctions of jewelry. No such sales 
took pl ace for this event. The 
Islamic Relief Organization will 
work out the details of donations 
later. 

At 9:30 p.m., the guests received 
their food - chicken kabobs - while 
Mohammed Kotob, another UCSD 
graduare, proposed a far-reaching 
boycott of companies that donate 
money to the Israeli state. 

The event concluded peacefully 
and successfully, according to MSA 
President Ahmed Salem. He sees the 
goals of his organization and thi s 
event to be twofold : U to establish a 
connection with the community" and 
"to inform people [about events in the 
Middle East)." 

"The No. I thing is to stop the 
killing," he said . "Then it is to es tab-
lish a right of returning for their 
homes with no fear of mi litary action. 
The real situation in Palestine will 
never be understood unless people are 
well-educated ." 

Butcher: 
Lawyer compares case to 
that of Richard Jewel 
Continued from page 1 
Butcher and his family "for the hard -
shi p and distress caused" by the 
arrest. A similar statement was made 
by Mammoth authorities a day later. 

Butcher's attorneys, Richard 
Hirsch and Vicki Podberes~ . .'y, took 
the unconventional step of turning 
I)"e r the defense's entire lot of evi-
dence 111 an attempt to prevent the 
case from going to tria l and causing 
an even bigger stir in the public eye 
for what they said were wrongful 
accusations. 

Within a day of Butcher's April 6 
arrest, s tories about the case had 
appeared in news publications rang-

UCSD associate prof wins Guggenheim award 
The winners of the John Simon Guggenheim 

Memorial Foundation's 78th annual U.s. and 
Canadian competition were announced last week by 
Foundation President Joel Conarroe. 

Among the 184 artists, scholars and scientists 
selected to receive the awards, which total $6.75 
million, was UCSD associate professor of new 
media art Lev Manovich. His selection was based 
on his "avant-garde art of the early 20th century 
and new media culture: according to a press 
release. 

Recipients of the award are chosen based on the 
basis of distinguished achievement in the past and 
exceptional promise for future accomplishment. 
Decisions are also based on recommendations from 
hundreds of expert advisers and are approved by the 
foundation's board of trustees. 

UCSD researcher to unveil new 
computation theory at ledure 

Robert Hecht-Nielson of the department of elec-
trical and computer engineering will present his new 
theol)' of thalamocortical information processing in a 
speech April 23 at 5 p.m. in the Garren Auditorium, 
located in the Basic Science Building in the school of 
medicine. 

In his speech, Hecht-Nielson will give UCSD a 
preview of the theol)', which he will announce pub-
licly at a later date. 

The theol)' has four basic elements to it. Two of 
them address novel associative memory nueral net-
works, while the other two address a single universal 
information processing operation and a recurrent 
brain command loop mechanism, respectivelY. 

The lecture will begin with an overview, followed 
by a description of the elements of the theory and 
their implications. The lecture will then tum to exper-
iments that employ computer implementations of 
the neural networks component of the theory. 

Aside from its relevance to neuroscience, this 
theol)' also provides a mathematical substrate that 
may eventually serve as a foundation for artificial 
intelligence. 

The evening will be hosted by Dr. Terrence J. 
Sejnowski.

BaRling the . •

lile 

Dangerous college drinking 
trends have proliferated 
alarmingly, but UCSD 
imbibement remains stable 
and relatively low--risk 

, , 1:27 a. m.: Police detained a 21-
yea r-old fem ale student for being 

drun k in publ ic at Stewart Hall. 
Transported to detox. 

"2:09 a. m.: A 20-year-old student was 
arrested on Regems Road for driving under 
the influence of alcohol and in violation of a 
court order. Transported to CentralJ ail. 

"2:·+2 a.m. : Pol ice arrested a 20-year-old 
male nonaftlliate on La Jolla Village Drive 
for being drunk in public and for vandalism. 
Transported to County Jail after being 
rejected by detox." 

The list goe on. Ever wonder how many 
people really get transported to detox on an 
average night? Or holV many people actual-
ly get caught drunk in public? For every 
person who is reported, there are probably 
30 puking their guts out from a night of 
heavy binge drinking. 

College drinking has become somewhat 
of a culrure. To most, the college experience 
is not complete without alcohol. But should 
college drinking really be considered a rite 
of passage? 

While UCSD can be considered to be at 
a safe distance from high-a lert alcoholism, 
binge drinking continues to be a problem 
for the college community. 

A recent study published in the Joumal of 
Srudirs 011 Alcohol estimated that over 1,400 
studems ages 18 through 24 in two- and 
four-year colleges died in 1998 from alco-
hol -related unimemional injuries, including 
motor vehicle crashes. 

Surveys conducted in 1999 showed that 
in the preceding year, o"cr 2 million of the 
8 million college students in the United 
States drove under the influence of alcohol, 
and over 3 million rode with a drunken dri-
ver. The study also reported that over 
500,000 full-time , four-year college Stu-

dents were unintentionally injured under 
the influence of alcohol, and over 600,000 
were hit or assaulted by another student 
who had been under the influence. 

These extreme numbers resemble more 
than just "college students who drink." The 
figures have manifested themselves through 
the increasing occurrence of binge drinking. 
These findings have prompted many col-
leges and universities to expand prevention, 
awareness and treatment programs to reduce 
alcohol-related injuries among students. 

A newer national report published last 
week, "A Call to Action: Changing the 
Culnlre of Drinking at U .S. Colleges," pro-
filed those who were most prone to drink-
ing: "First-year snldenrs (during the first 
weeks of arrival), males, whites, members of 
fraternities and sororities [and] athletes." 

Furthermore, college students who fre-
quently binge drink are increasingly prone to 
being the victim or perpetrator of sexual 
abuse, assault, vandalism, property damage 
and alcohol abuse. Students who binge drink 
suffer from academk and health problems 
and are more likely to engage in unsafe sex 
and have frequent suicide attempts. 

So where does UCSD fall relative to this 
national phenomenon? 

According to the Core Alcohol Drug 
Survey, which was conducted at UCSD in 
1999 by Lupe Samaniego-Kraus and Nancy 
Wahlig of the Student Safety Awareness 
Program, UCSD has a 3 I percent rate of 
high-risk alcoholism, contrasted with the 
national average of 44 percent. The ranking 
is based on a five-drink scale, after which is 
the average threshold for belligerent behav-
ior. 

It was also found that 58 percent of those 
polled at UCSD who drank were under 21 
years of age. Of the 465 students surveyed, 

• 
• 

Pat laing/Guardian .... ,. 
~,~ ; ;;,~,. 

the annual prevalence (consumption of 
liquor witl1i n the past year) was at 76 percent. 

I am happy to report that UCSD falls 
below the national average. and that it is 
safe to say that 72 percent of UCSD stu-
dents, according to the e.O.R.E. survey, are 
not high-risk drinkers. 

Most researchers believe that a college 
campus' rate of alcohol consumption and 
alcohol-related problems stem from that 
particular university's alcohol policy. They 
believe that there exist environmental fac-
tors - aside from individual alcoholism -
that sustain or restrain high-risk alcoholism 
on campus. 

So what is UCSD's policy? 
In place since 1968, the basic alcohol 

policy at UCSD states that students under 
2 1 are not allowed to consume or possess 
alcohol in any public or private area on 
campus. Alcohol consumption is prohibited 
for all students in public areas of the on-
campus housing fac.ilities operated by 
UCSD. 

Students over 21 can have alcohol in pri-
vate areas. However, they are not allowed to 
possess large-volume containers such as 
kegs. No unlicensed individual of any agc is 
allowed to sell alcohol in the residence halls 
or apartments. In licensed on-campus facil-
ities not operated by UCSD, large-volume 
containers of alcohol such as kegs, pony 
kegs and "party balls" are prohibited. 

Campus policy states that the use of alco-
hol or othcr drugs does not limit the 
responsibility of individuals for their 
actions. Additionally, party spOl\sors are 
responsible for all damage caused by their 
guests. 

However, while UCSD's alcohol policy 
seems to be straightforward and zero-toler-
ance, UCSD has witnessed a varied rein-

forcement of these policies over the }'ears. 
In June 1997, UCSD installed an alcohol 
surcharge that affected the two priv:ltel y 
owned pubs on campus. [n add ition, 
UCSD's policy prohibits "alcohol promo-
tion or advertising, including advertising 
that implies rhat alcohol will be available at 
an event." 

UCSD is not a high-risk campus, due to 
the many programs and campaigns thar 
make an effort curb alcohol related injuries. 
Many programs designed to increase stu-
dent alcohol awareness have sprung up in 
recent years, and they may be the contribut-
ing factors to UCSD's low levels of binge 
drinking. 

Thurgood Marshall College's Alcohol 
Awareness Week, which takes place every 
second week of April, advertises the conse-
quences of alcoholism. UCSD's award-win-
ning Triton Taxi program, recently extended 
to TIjuana, is a student-run safe ride pro-
gram that provides students with an alterna-
tive to drinking and driving. 

Another award-winning program is 
Creating Responsible Alcohol Services and 
Habits. C.R.A.S.H. was an extensive cam-
paign that taught alcohol statistics and 
activities that promote safer partying. It was 
eventually followed by Celebrating Healthy 
Environments through the Empowerment 
of Responsible Students, or C.H.E.E.R.S. 

Currently, the "Most" campaign is also 
promoting the unattractiveness of drinking. 
Surely, most UCSD students have seen the 
black and orange signs that advertise UCSD 
alcohol statistics. 

Drinking affects all college studen ts. 
even those who choose not to drink. It is 
evident that UCSD is doing its part to help 
alleviate the problems caused by alcohol 
abuse.

know me by name. No one as lazy 
as I clearly am has any business in 
a class with the word "step" in its 
title, let alone "aerobics." 

But I went to the class. And I 
should have walked Out in the first

And it's not even like everyone

they're the only person in a room 
wearing soccer shorts and a T-shirt 
that looks more like a tent because 
the California Cellulite Statute 
doesn't legally allow you to be in 
public wearing less than that. 

No, most of these people 
looked downright bad in that 
Spandex of theirs. 

What made it even worse: The

Editor: 
In the article U Across thc cam-

pus, across the world," (Monday, 
April 15) Sarah Hassaine 
addressed the issue of Jewish-
Palestinian relations on campus. 
For the last year, I have been 
working to improve these rela-
tions as co-chair of the Unified 
Campus Coalition along with 
Nema Milaninia, a Warren 
senior and Muslim. 

However, I regret to inform 
vou that our efforts thus far have 
failed . Now we see the conflict 
entering a new stage reminiscent 
of Anti-Zionism Week last year. 
On April IS , a campaign to dis-
grace the Jews and spread anti-
Jewish sentiment began. The 
method was a typical one: quot-

ing forgeries of supposedly 
Jewish sources that indicate, in 
no uncertain terms, the hateful 
and malicious nature of the Jews 
and Judaism. 

After the uproar about a bad 
joke in Tht Koala earlier this year, 
[ have to wonder: Will this 
instance of hate speech receive 
equal attention? Indeed, a better 
question is, how do we prevent 
this from happening again? 

I have been asking myself that 
ever since last yea r. One method 
we as the UCC tried was to 
bring together the heads of the 
Union of Jewish Students and 
the Muslim Students 
Association, David Weisberg and 
Ahmed Salem, respectively. We 
discussed what to do in the event 
of hateful postings such as last 
Monday'S, as well as what we can 
do to improve relations between 
Jews and Muslims on campus. 

Weisberg proposed, as he was 
quoted in your article, that the 
commuruties come together out-
side the scope of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. He suggest-
ed, among other things, a joint 
community service project to 
promote the goal of improving 
the world around us, which is 
intrinsic in Islam as Zakah as well 
as in Judaism in Tzedakah. 

These proposals, however, 
were met with the accusation by 
Salem that we were all being 
"fake." Everything, he said, 
comes down to Palestine. He 
claimed to have no problem with 
Jews, but he made it clear that he 
could only join in an activity with 
Jews if they would denounce 
Israel as a Nazi state and lsraeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as a 
modern-day Hitler. Even the 
most liberal Jew would have a big 
problem with that loaded com-
parison. 

Indeed, nothing was accom-
plished. Milaninia, Weisberg and 
I left feeling hurr, but we 
nonetheless sought another 
meeting with Salem. He has not 
yet replied to the e-mails I sent 
months ago. Instead, the last 
time we spoke, he asked, "Do you 
think that just because you are 
the Chosen People, you have the 
right to kill me?" 

In the course of my attempts 
to bring these communities 
together, there have been far toO 
many disheartening instances 
such as these. I have even dealt 
with personal attacks from one 
individual. [ was slandered, called 
anti-Muslim, and unfounded 
claims were made that I had sup-
posedly insulted this person . 
Thus, it did not surprise me 
when I learned that this individ-
ual last week was on Library 
Walk telling people stories a bout 
Israel injecting poison into the 
eggs of Palestinians to prevent 
them from reproducing. 

My point here is not to attack 
a couple of extremist students, 
but to say that I hope that the 
majority of Jewish and Muslim 
students - and indeed all ratio-
nal students at UCSD - will 
stand with me and denounce 
these kinds of attitudes. We may 
disagree on a lot of very impor-
tant things, but there are also 
important things that we can 
agree on. 

I think a lot of us can agree on 
even more than we think. 
However, all too often the people 
that supposedly represent us do 
not present a view that we really 
agree with. For example, Jewish 
supporters of Israel, such as me, 
often wholeheartedly disagree 
with actions that th.! leaders of 
Israel rake that cause suffering 
for innocent Palestinians. There 

is a middle path; it JUSt needs to 
be beaten down by brave Ollis. 

Despite all the setb'lcks. I till 
have hope . We will always fi nd 
individuals who will try to ta nd 
in the way of what is good and 
what is right. But we must tran-
scend these few and try to rC:l(h 
the many. 1 f you, reading this, are 
such a person, and you wall t to 
joi n with others like yOll, please 
contact me and the Uni fier! 
Campus Coalition . We need cath 
other now, more than e\'e r 
before. 

[ want to see if we, the undcr-
spoken majority, cannot shut the 
closed-minded minority lip and 
forge for ourselves a path to trus t 
and peace.

Students should 
not pick up the tab 
for state budget 
Editor: 

As many are aware, California 
is faring a serious budget crisis. 
This has led many to suggest 
raising student fees by 10 per-
cent. Such an increase would cost 
students a little over $400 a year, 
without any increase in the ser-
vices provided to students or the 
quality of their education. 

Essentially, the state would be 
acting like a landlord, making 
students pay for 13 months of 
rent when we only live there for a 
year. Students are already loaded 
with debt and barely making it 
through.

Um, come again) 
Avparently all that work I just 

did was what we in the profes-
sional aerobics world like to call 
walkillg ill plo(t . 

And yes, I am totally screwed . 
Besides walking in place, I was 

expected to kick my legs in ran -
dom places - putting everyone 
around me at risk - 3nd I also 
had to occasionally step up onto a 
big block of plastic. Hence the 
term step aerobics. 

Of course, the next day I felt as 
if someone had run me over with 
:I car, slammed me into a brick 
wall ; and then shot me in the ass. 
r didn't even know r had that 
many muscles in my butt capable 
of gett.ing that sore. 

So basically, I have decided 
that because I hardly ever get up 
off my ass anyway, no one can see 
it, and therefore it doesn't matter 
if r never do step aerobics again. 

Furthermore, if I ever see that 
Minnie Mouse chick again, I will 
step on her face (but not her 
boobs, because I might get cata-
pulted to the moon). Besides, 
don't guys like big butts?

Senior Staff Writer 

Civil rights activist Mary Frances 
Berry called for increased diversity 
in higher education when she spoke 
ro students and staff at the Price 
Center Theater on April 17. 

Berry exp13ined the need for con-
tinued efforts to help minority stu-
dents get into college and graduate. 

She spoke of the strides made 
during the civil rights movements 
of the 1960s. She said that the 
minority students and staff in the 
room attested to the success of the 
movements, but added that more 
work is needed. 

"We are in a period of stagna-
tion," Berry said. "It's hard to find a 
way to make further progress. The 
Supreme Court is trying to turn 
back the clocks." 

She referred to the pending 
Universiry of Michigan admissions 
affirmative action case, which could 
overturn the Bakke v. UC Regents 
case. 

Berry also noted the role educa-
tion plays. 

"We need to educate people for 
them to live in this world," Berry 
said. "We need respect for human 
potential." 

Berry said multicultural education 
and finding ways to admit students of 

color were some of the issues sur-
rounding higher education today. 

"We need a supportive environ-
ment and we need to increase facul-
ry of color," she said. 

Berry also discussed the impor-
tance of retention and said mat uni-
versities need to find ways to help stu-
dents feel comfortable on campuses. 

Berry is the chairperson for the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 
and is the Geraldine R. Segal 
Professor of American Social 
Thought at the University of 
Pennsylvania, where she teaches 
law and history. Berry is also one of 
the founders of the Free South 
Africa Movement, the recipient of

Spe1kil1l out Mary Frances Berry spoke to students and staff at the Price Center Theater on April 17. She spoke of past civil 
rights accomplishments and current goals. She addressed the role that education had to play in the civil rights movement sa0ng 
that multicultural education and getting students of color access to higher education were important issues today.

"Bridging communities is what 
this event is about," said A.S. 
PresidentJeff Dodge. "It brought a 
national figure to campus to talk 
about issues of diversity and civil 
rights not only for students but to 
citizens across the country." 

Dodge said .he felt inspired by 
her speech. 

"It's fabulous to have somebody 
say what they feel," he said. 

Berry also urged the audience to 
maintain their commitment to 
diversity. 

"Wartime causes us to reinforce 
our abandonment of social justice," 
she said. 

Berry said change takes .place 
because of social activism and 
movements. 

"Power concedes nothing with-
out a demand," she said. 

The event began with a perfor-
mance by the UCSD gospel choir 
and was followed by a student panel 
discussion, an audience question-
and-answer session and a book 
signing. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Marisol Gutierrez said 
she came tc the speech to get expo-
sure to new ideas. She said she was 
interested in seeing how Berry's 
speech addressed some of the issues 
in her ethnic studies course. 

President and chair of MECHA 
Catherine Medrano said, 
"Institutionalized racism runs deep, 
but activism does exist in terms of 
retention and outreach." 

The event was sponsored by the 
A.S. Council, the UCSD Council 
of Provosts, the San Diego State 
Univer'it)' Student Affairs 
Division, and the SDSU Office of 
Diversity and Equity. 

said that presenting investiga-
tors with the evidence before

chance of being exonerated 
before what could have become

lengthy tri a I. 

Although allegations against 
Butcher had made international 
news, the fai th of his fri ends 
went undeterred. 

Colin Casper, Butcher's 
teammate on the UCSD 
snowboard team, was one of 
the people interviewed by 
investigators. Casper said he 
never believed the allega ti ons 
made against his fellow team-
mate . 

"I was utterly surprised 
when I first heard about his 
arrest," Casper said in defense 
of his close friend of four years. 
"I knew it wasn 't him. Peter is 
one of the nicest people I've 
ever met. H e's very frie ndly and 
generous; there 's no way he 

woul,~ ever do anything like

Hirsch sa id he wanted to

of his client's case that had been 
applied to the FBI investigation 
of Richard Jewel, the suspected 
bomber at the 1996 SUlllmer 
Olympics in Atlanta, Ga., who 
sued major networks after being 
assumed the culprit in several 
newscasts. 

"People are accused through 
the media all the time of crimes 
they didn 't commit," Hirsch 
said. "We have to be very care-

Chair and A.S. Programmer-elect 
Gube Grossman. "Convoy was our 
fourth choice." 

The cho,en bands seemed pop-
ular wIth the crowd, which steadily 
grew for each performance. 

"The crowd was great," said 
Strai ght N o Chaser drummer 
Brandon Sull ivan. "It was also a lot

Straight No Chaser played the 
second set of the festival. 

Although Convoy headlined 
Ihe festival and seemed to impress 
the crowd with its set, which 
mcluc..led a cover of The vVho's 
"Baha O'Reilly" - commonly 
known as "Teenage Wasteland" -
Sugarcult seemed to be the crowd 
favorite . 

"When we were searching for 
bands, Sugarcult was a smaller band 
[than Convoy]," Grossman said. 
"But in the past month with the 
four tracks on the Van Wilder 
soundtrack and better radio play, 
they've really come up." 

Indeed, Sugarcult lead singer 
Tim Pagnotta put on quite 3 show, 
calling his mother from a lost cell 
phone and yelling to Muir studcms 
who remained in the dorms, "Get 
oUI here, there is a concert in your 
f---ing bad.:yard." 

"Everybody loved Sugarcult," 
Grossman said . "They were the 
most high-energy performance of 
the night. There were more people 
a king, 'Hey, who is this?' than I've 
ever had at any concert." 

Pagnotta said he was equally 
impressed with the organizers of 
I\\uirstock. 

"We honestly didn 'l expect 
[Muirsrock] to be this fun," said the 
La Jolla-born Pagnotta . "This 
show was planned very well, and 
kids came out. Compared to other 
college shows, this one was one of 
the best." 

Pagnotta had one complaint 
about the show: He was very 
unhappy with rhe srringem security 
surrounding the concertgoers. 

"If anything was sucl." about 
tonight, it was the security guards," 
he said.

As commissioner of ("o~unicationJ Navnee,· Grewal might acru-

ally get UCSD radio station KSDT a frequency one day. • 
"The frequency in San Diego CQsts $1 million for an FM station,

UCS D has a eouple,of options. The main one'we're lqoking at right 
now is commissioning a snldy to show that, with the new technology, 
you don't need a .3 difference [between stations]." 

Grewal, who co-founded Tht Nightcap, an alternative, on-campus 
publication, got into politics through her involvement in on-campus 

media. 
"1 decided I would run because I think with 

the media on campus, there's not a lot of expo-
sure and I think that really needs to be 
changed," Grewal said. 

However, what really sparked her interest in 
running were her fellow studen ts on rhe 
Students First ticket. 

"They're all the pec;>ple I have known who 
have done alhazing things at UCSD," Grewal 
said. , ,~ 

Besides getting UCSD a radio frequency, 
Grewal says she would really like to see, more 
exposure for on-campus media. 

"There's a media fair this year, and I want 
that to be bigger," Grewal said. "1 also want the 
UCSD Web site to have a link to media orga 
~HI.4!/~ niutions." 

, . Although the media budget is limited, 
Grewal wants to help · on-c:ampus media find alternative sources of 
funding in addition to AS, money. . 

Grewal also wants to see an increase indiversily. 
"1 know right now there's a lot of tal(( about diversity," she said.

~CSD senior conducts campuswide survey 
Seana Doughty'S new poll shows widespread support for UCSD 

By SARA HAHN 
Contributing Writer 

Most students at UCSD feel pos-
itive about thei r school environ-
ment, cl ai ms a senior student-
research survey. 

Fifteen upper-division sociology 
majors conducted the Campus 
Climate Assessment. Sea na 
Doughty, a sociology major and 
Thurgood Marshall College senior, 
compiled the results. 

Students were asked about their 
invol vement in and their beliefs on 
the ethnic, racial and political envi-
ronment at UCSD. 

Of the smdents surveyed, 75 per-
cent said that they "strongly agreed" 
or "agreed" that tIley felt a sense of 
belon!,';ng at UCSD. 

Fewer students were content 
with the religious am\ etlutic di-
mate, with 61 percent agreeing that 
the campus possessed an open-
ntinded religious understandi ng and 
59 percent saying that UCSD is a 
positive environment for ethnic and 
racial wlcerstanding. 

A survey specifically addres ing 
the overall emotional and psycho-
logical climate of UCSD ha never 
berore been conducted, accordi ng to 
Doughty, who compiled the Sr.1tiS-
tics for an independent resea rch 
project during winter quarter. 

"Other universities do it almual-
Iy," Doughty said. " I can only hope 
tIlat in the face of all the expansion 
UCSD will be havi ng in tile next 
decade, the administrati Oll \vill look 
at tile results and real ize how impor-
tant feedback is. Students need to be 
happy because it's a critical aspect of 
tile college experience." 

During fall 200t, sociology stu-
dents in Sociolol,,}, 108: Survey 

Research Methods telephoned 
UCSD students. They sUlveyed 164 
students, representing a diverse eth-
nic and religious mixture. 

"The o. 1 problem ... was get-
ting in touch with students," 
Doughty said. "People were very 
interested in what we were doing. 
They seemed very cooperative. I 
was pleasantly surprised." 

Many students also expressed a 
positive feel ing of campus tolerance 
and understanding. Almost all sm-
dents - 88 percent - believe that 
opportunities exist on campus to 
experience other cultures. 

About half of all smdents are reli-
giously involved, with 54 percent 
stating that they consider them-
selves religious. The most popular 
political party at UCSD is the 
Democratic Party, to which 39 per-
cent of students belong. Also, 58 
percent of students are members of 
a student club or organization. 

Students who said that they did

Doughty conducted the survey 

not feel a sense of belonging at 
UCSD tended to belong to lUlCler-
represented minority groups, 
including students who are Afri can-
American, American Indian, 
Mexican-American and Latino. 

"1 wasn 't surprised about the 
findings on traditionally underrep-
resented minoriti es," Doughty said. 
"We have such a small percentage of 
African-Americans, Latinos and 
Native Americans that 1 wasn't sur-
prised if they didn't feci the sa me 
se~se ~f belonging as whites or 
Asians. 

Some students expressed surprise 
at the survey's results. 

"I'm surprised because over-
whelmingly, on an individual basis, 
when I ta lk to people they don't 
seem [0 be happy here," said Earl 
Warren College freshma n Eaden 
Eshaghi. 

",farren sophomore Scott 
Shapiro also doubted the results. 

"I'm somewhat surprised," 
Shapiro said. "11lere's a lot of peo-
ple who like it hcre. But there's no 
Greek housing, no college to\I~l and 
you're isol:lted unless vou havc a

Doughty, who worked all till: 
projcct with sociolof,'Y prot'c 501' 
Akos Rona-Tas, expressed surpnse 
as well. 

"1 couldn't believe the results 
because tIlcre's this stereotype that 
students are really apathetic and 
don't have the same unity that 
UCLA or Berkeley do," Doughty 
said. "I was surprised tha t most peo-
ple said 'Yes, I do feci like I belong 
at UCSD.'" 

Other students were less sur-
prised.

U CSD's college system has failed in its mission 
By EDWU 
Senior Staff Writer 

As I led a gaggle of prospective freshmen 
engineering snldents la t weekend, I worried 
about tile state of my transfer appltcation . 

The simation was ra ther odd,l must admit. 
Ilere I was, trying my best to remain loyal to 
my engineering'school by pitching UCSD over 
schools that I had applied to and these fresh-
men had a Iso been accepted to. 

The best r could do without betraying thc 
intentions of tile engineering school - 1 am 
still loyal to it, de pite my objections to the 
general focus on engineering and tlle general 
focus of engineenng wlder/.rraduates at UCSD 
- was to tell them what brought me to UCSD 
while I made clear to tllcm tile fu ndamental 
problem: the failure of tile college system. 

Agalll and agalll , I am retmnded that 
UCSD's college system does nodll1lg to solve 
the problem of a large puhlic ulliversity: name-
II'. the lll11nerOUS barriers to social interaction 

~esulong from a lack of repcated contact with 
th~ same people. 

UCSD offers few of tile social benefits of a 
Iargc lUllversity. Lacklllg any football team to 
draw the university ragether and lacking an~' 
concentrated off-campus housll1g, tll<! social 
environment at UCSD can hardly be com-
pared to that of UCLA or UC Santa Barbara. 

Botll L.A. and Santa Barbara have a prima-
ry ofT-campus area saturated with college stu-
dents. As a result, those campuses' inadeqoate 
on-campus housing is offset by til!' social and 
conuncrcial environment dlat permeates dleir 
vicinity. 

The lack of any off-campus student hous-
ing center prevents UCSD from producing a 
positive aOllospltere similar to that at colleges 
with viable off-campu~ populations. UCSD 
Iltight as well be a community college when it 
comes to Its off-campus populatlon. 

The Six-college system IS presumably the 
,ohiOan because It can tlC off-campus students 
to a pecific locltion. but It depends on creat-

Ill~ \1abl c on-campus COllll11Ultiues. 
UCSD is moddeo after Cambridge, wher~ 

31 colleges independently admit and house stu-
dents, bur the Ulllvcrsltl' tcaches all students 
and awards all degrees. Each college has a spe-
cific feel and history, and tile individual colleges 
arc interesting communities on their own. 
Some even have tlleir own pubs. 

Our system fails 10 emulate Cambridge for a 
number of reasons. The fi rst problem is emoll-
rnent size; UCSD~ average college has 3,500 
underl,'l'aduates, which is five to seven times 

Cambridge'~ number. It's even tIlree times the 
average population of the residential coll eges at 
tile University of California at Santa Cmz. 

Also, UCSD Ollly offers six choices, with no 

SUlVey: 
Some students disagree with 
results produced by sUNey 
Continued from page 10 

"I thinlc anywhere you go, there's 
going to be a percentage of people 
that aren't happy," said Marshall 
freshman Tasha Yee. "When people 
say they don't like school , they 
should do something about it. I'm 
having a rea lly good experience 
bec3llse I'm getting involved and 
doi ng things I enjoy." 

Doughty hopes the survey wi ll 
be used by fu ture UCSD admi nis-
trations; she suggests that it would 
be easier for students to access sur-
veys on StudentLink.. 

"1 think that this is a good start," 
she said. "I f the administration 
takes it seri ously, they can start hav-
ing an expanded effort." 

While some studen ts doubted 
the survey's resul ts, most feel good 
about UCSD. 

"The laid-back atmosphere at 
UCSD allowed me to develop my 
personal ity on my own and allowed 
me to develop my life and political 
opinions as I wanted to," said 
Warten senior Brian Brook. "As / 'm 
about to leave UCSD, I feel really 
certain that I wouldn't have gotten 
that al any other school. ~ 

substantial di fferences between many of dlem 
except general education requirements. 

T he problem with large size and few choic-
es is that it discourages characterization of the 
colleges as distinct individual entities. As ,I 
result, lUldergraduates don't have any particu-
lar affinity for their college beyond its determi-
'nation of dleir general education requirements. 

Another fail ing of the college system is the 
obsession with building on-campus apart-
ments. While tIli s may be in response to stu-
dent preferences, a cmcial part of living togeth-
er is eating together. The one-rate plan is a step 
toward that, but there are still inherent prob-
lems: Function follows form, and by neady 
grouping students in fours or fives, on-campus 
aparOllents simply encourage the division of 
students. It is a travesty to place frc hmen in 
on-campus aparonents because the apartments 
so readilv stitIe social interaction. 

Lasdi·, without any semblance of four-year 
housing, it IS no wonder tIlat tIlere is no sense 
of affi liation with a college after freshman year. 
The ahsence of uppcr-dil~sion students in resi-
dential halls (witll the exception of tile RAs) 
destroys opportunities for older students to 
participate III the soci.llization process of 
younger ones, including tile instilmcnt of col-
lege-centered pride. Lack of housing is no 
excuse; ullle!>S a critical mass is situated on cam-
pus, how docs anyone expect a college to gain 
any identity? 

Tyfer Huff/Guardian ome may argue dlat tile . failures of on-
campus life, the commuter mentality alld dIe 
homogenization of the colleges are growing 
pains in a young university. I arglle the exact 
oppo ite: Tltis problem is a result of deliberate 
decisions, and dlere is no reason UCSD should 
face the wlderl,'l'aduatc crisis it currently has. 

Slam dunk: San Diego nalive Mike Thomas slam; a ball at the Revelle Courts 

In addition, UCSD is heading further down 
this path. The conversion to on-campus ap.1ft-
ments i gro\\~ng, not dWllldling. Old Revelle 
ha, dle highest concentr;toon of residential 
hall, but Iy\'arren tavored aparunent:. Ol'er 001'-
mltory housm:;. The long-range plan for 
RCl'ellc ca lls for demoli 'hl1l:; the Fleet bUlld-
mg' and Plaza Cafe to make roOIll for more 
apartnlents. 

I lomogenization is bound to IIlcreasc with 
enrollment. "hil l' college can barel), house all 
of its freshmen, and while tile 1963 plan for the 
campus called for 12 college~, this has been 
scaled back to eight. 

\Nhat can rectify these problems? The firs t 
solution is a comprchensive plan to house four 
years of students on campus. Applications for 
on-campus housing should be intimately tied 
to on-campus involvement and academic e.~cel­
lence, rather dml a lonery system for a select 
number of sophomores. UCSD must va lue 
motivated and interesting undergraduates as 
the cornerstone of the college system. 

Secondly, students in contiguous majors 
should take lower-division classes with stll-
dents from their collegc. For example, certam 
sections of Math 20A should be restricted to 
students from a particular college, and classes 
witll multipl e lectures need to be segregated

of 5tudents by their major rather tIlan b), tlleir

The campus must also move back to build-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 22, 2002 

to the Students 

Fellow students, hate is among us. In our midst, lurk people who are attempting to put 
our distinguished University on the path towards a hate .. filled conflict. 

F ound on this campus on Monday, April 15 was some of the most vile and filthy anti-
Semitic material that has ever been distributed at UCSD. These fliers, entitled 
"Teachings from the Talmud" (a book ofJewish Law), attempted to slander the Jewish 
people. The passages used in these fliers are known forgeries and anyone who attempts to 
use them, uses them only in an effort to spew a message of hate. The perpetrators of this 
act of incitement have goals obviously opposed to the ideals of this University. Those 
who have placed these fliers seek only to divide our campus and this is something that we 
will not stand for. 

We urge everyone to keep their eyes open for those responsible as no one knows who 
might be the next target of such hate. We must put our differences aside and stand united 
in an effort to say to the haters that they are not welcome at UCSD. 

Therefore we call upon you, fellow scholars, to stand united against ignorance and hate. 
Please report anyone who is spreading hate on our campu~ to the University authorities. 

Let those who act in hate know that they are acting alone. 

"We acknowledge that our society carries historical and divisive biases based on race, 
ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, reli~on, and poUtical beliefs. Therefore, 
we seek to foster understanding and tolerance among individua~ and groups, and we promote 
awareness through education and constructive strategies for resolving conflict."

A.s.: 
New officers bring new ideas for 
the 2002-2003 .school year 
Continued from page 9 

Kevin Hsu 
The new vice 

president inter-
nal, Kevin Hsu, 
hasn't been plan-
ning his political 
career since the 
second grade. 

«When peo· 
pie ask me why I 
do Associated 
Students, I tell 
them it's just a 
thing 1 got into," 
Hsu said. "You 

Associated Students get involved on 
campus because 

that's part of the whole college experience." 
Though smdenr govcrruncnt was relative-

ly new to him, Hsu didn't miss a beat getting 
involved once he came to college. The sopho-
more Warren student has promised, among 
other things, to reform Student 
Organizations and Leadership Opportunities. 

"Right now, S.O.L.O. advisers, for what-
ever reason, will impede student organiza-
tions from putting on eventS," Hsu said. "I 
think one of the problems right now is there 
is no accowltabiliry for S.O.L.O. advisers. 
Part of that accowltabiliry is to see if we can 
have more direct student control over 
S.O.L.O. advisers that arc supposed to be 
helping our organizations." 

When talking about such ambitious tasks 
and reforms, I-lsu admitS that it is often hard 
being a smdent going against staff. 

"( think studentS who try to participate in 
the COlTUlluniry at large run into this a lot," 
I-lsu said. "You'll have professional staff or 
professional activistS, and they look at you like 
you don't even have a college degree." 

Hsu manages to take it all in snide. He 
one day hopes to go into publi<: service and 
perhaps become an elected official. 

Brie Finegold 
The new 

commissioner 
of student advo-
cacy is a John 
Muir College 
junior student 
majoring in 
political sci-
ence. Her role 
as a student 
advocate 
extends beyond 
her work on the 

Associated Students A.S. Council. 
Finegold also 

works in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender Resource Office and she 
enjoys working for her fellow students. 

"The reason 1 wanted to run for student 
advocacy is 1 really like fighting on behalf 
of people," Finegold said. "1 really like 
working with people to either get out of 
trouble they were accused of or advance 
goals they have." 

Finegold is a natural activist. She is cur-
rently campaigning to get ethnic studies 
into all California high school curricu-
huns . 

"Most of the activism I do is with a 
group called Youth Organizing 
Communities, working for educational 
justice in high schools," Finegold said. 

As commissioner of student advocacy, 
Finegold said she will work to make cam-
pus police and RSOs more accountable. 

"One of the big things I'm going to be 
working on .. . is establishing a police 
review board," Finegold said. "It will be a 
committee made of student, staff and fac-
ulty ... and that commirtee would help 
shape the policy of the police deparonent 
so they would truly be serving the cam-
pus." 

As far as a future in politics, Finegold 
says she is toying with the idea of becom-
ing a lawyer. 

"I'm thinking of maybe being a public 
defender," Finegold said. 

However, she also wants to teach.

good enough to earn him a provi-

NCAA finals. The fourth bid came 
when Clara 'Nilson ran a qual itying 
performance in the 4OO-metcr hur-
dles with a mark of 62.52, the best 
mark in the 

UC Santa Barbara, Cal State Long 
Beach, SDSU and others. 

"We really are [excited]." 
Salerno said. "The opportunity to 
have this sequence of meets where 
we're home every other weekend at 
the end of the season is ideal. This 
invitational is going to be very 
competi tive. " 

Most notably, however, the 
meet will also include several high-
pro file competitors, including shot

rerun lS home for what Salerno calls 
one of the most el ite competitions of 
the ye:lr : the UCSO Triton 
Im·itational. T he two-day event 
starts April 26 and will feature com-
plete teams from University of 
Southern Californi a and UCLA, 

Musings: 
People playing 1M sports 
should lighten up 
Continued from page 20 
the other team started playing 
rough and throwing out real insults 
and then it all went downhill . 

With about a minute left there 
was a bra wi at the other end of the 
courr. I looked down the coun and 
there was just this pile of bodies 
stomping, biting, doing whatever it 
took to get on top. Eventually the 
guys got separated, and the rest of the 
game was canceled. In the aftennath 
two of our players were suspended, as 
was one of the opposing players. 

Now I am on my second 1M 
team, softball, and I would like to say 
to all the basketball players that had 
a problem with a little banter: Shove 
it. People talk trash across the soft-
ball diamond, drink beers, and gen-
erally just have a good time. There is 
no animosity and making fun of each 
other is part of the good times . 

I suspect that many of the peo-
ple playing b:lsketball shoot the 
rock wi th the impression that they 
still have some kind of ski ll. T hey 
hold onto to this pipe dre~m of 
playi ng "good" basketball and act 
serious because of it. 

'ro all of you fitti ng that descrip-
tion, give it lip . You are playi ng 1M 
basketball , and unless you 're a 
ringer (and even if you are), you are 
probably not that good. I t i~ fun 
and if some teams want to talk 
trash, then that is their kind of fun. 
Shove off and let them enjoy. 

T.1kc a lesson from the softball 
fold - by the way, big props to the 
voll eyball softball team, bu t you'd 
think th ose 35-inch verti cals woult! 
get more than a four-run victory 
over a bunch of out-of-shape jour-
nalists - and rel ax. 

T hree more points before 1 
make my exodus: 

I. 4/20 once again lived up to its 
billing as one of the biggest sports 
days of the year with three exciting 
basketball games and a plethora of 
baseball to be consumed. 

2. UCSD ultimate Frisbee needs 
to think of a better name than the 
Squids. I love what you do out 
there, but squids sounds like slugs. 
Let's use some of that Triton imag-
ination that gave us the Sun God; 
let's strike fear into ollr opponents. 

3. Speaking of fear, has anyone 
else noticed the way our womens 
rugby terun is destroying the compe-
tition this year? Spr ingboks, All 
Blacks, watch out! 

Keep on musing.

the world . Our 
discus field is world renowned -
we have some of the top guys in 
the world. We have guys of that 
caliber, and then UCLA, who is 
the top throwing team in the 
country. But compared to the 
other guys, they'll look I ike chil-
dren, and that gives you some 
perspecti ve about the level of 
world -class competition. This 
will be the rop-Ievel competition 
in the San Diego area this year, so 
it 'll be quite a show." 

"I t was such a great crowd to have 
my final home game at. " 

Hemmerl y added, "Seeing my 
family Ollt there was just fantastic. It 
has been a wonderful time. I'm sad 
to sec the season ending soon." 

Rejected: UCSD goalie Andrea Cornford blocks an SDSU shot last Friday. 
Cornford had 11 saves in the game, but it wasn't enough as the Aztecs won 8-7. 

With the end of the regular sea-
son, UCSD now heads into the crit-
ical W1NPA Conference 
Tournament. They ellter the tour-
ncy as the N o. 3 seed behind rivals 
UC Davis and Loyola Marymount. 

To advance to the NCAA 
Championships, the Tritons will 
most likely face both of these tearns. 
However, there is no short supply of 
confidence within the team. 

" ' '''c 're going to kick some hurr," 
Hcmmerly said. "1 think our play the 
last few weeks has [UC Davis and 

LNfU) worried." 
Sanders sought to find the silver 

lining fTOm his team's loss. 
"I think they wi ll be more hungry 

[after the SDSU loss]," Sa ndcr~ ~ai d . 
"The desire to win is what we have, 
and r think we can lise it to cJrry 1I~

outstanding victory against UC 
Riverside. 

The Tritons dominated 
Westmont on Friday, with every 
UCSD singles and doubles player 
earning victories without any play-
er losing a match. 

The singles winners were 

Sammer Chopra (6-1, 7 -6), 
Michael Meyer (6-0, 6-1), Bry:1n 
Swatt (6-4, 6-1), Jeff Wilson (6-0,

For the doubles, it was the duos of 
Chopra/Swatt (8-2), 
Wilson/Everett Schroeter (8·0), 
and Meyer/Dan Albrecht (8-2) 
who continued the Triton momen-
tum in the match. 

"We crushed them," Jeff Wilson 
said. "It was a very good victory." 

Westmont also rested four 
starters in the match. 

"It was kind of a slap in the 
face," Wilson said. "They over-

Tritons sweep their last 
home doubleheader 
Continued from page 20 
Roadnmners put the tying and go-
ahead mns on base with two outs in 
the top of the seventh before UCSD 
senior second baseman Samantha 
Hayes snared a sinking pop·up to 
end the game. 

"We played more relaxed in the 
second game," said Triton head 
coach Patti Gerckens. "Whoever 
can play under pressure is going to 
go to postseason, and quite honestly 

that~ the way it should be." 
Needing desperately to stop the 

splits and sweep a doubleheader, 
UCSD found an unwelcome oppo-
nent Sanrrday for Senior Day. 

"I looked at the schedule and I 
sa id, 'Man, we have to play our last 
game against [Cal State] Dominguez 
Hills,' not because they're good, but 
just because I don 't like playing 
them. They're scrappy and cruddy 
- they always split," Harlan said. 

The Toros' scrappy style turned 
out to be a nonfactor when Harlan 
started Senior Day with style, throw-
ing a dominant one-hit shutout 
while striking out five. 

UCSD put together all the 
offense it needed in the third inning 
when, with one out, Mettee got her 
second of three hits in the game with 
a double. Kim Aggabao advanced 
her to third, and senior Kristina 
Anderson slapped a single down the 
right·field line to score Mettee. Not 
to be outdone, Harlan followed with 
a single, and Hayes hit a ball through 

'I don't like playing 
them. They're scrappy 

and cruddy - they 
always split.'

double, scoring Anderson. 

After the game closed with the 
Tritons on top 2-0, UCSD celebrat-
ed its opening-game win and the 
accomplishments of its seniors, but 
realized there was more work to be 
done. 

Harlan's was a tough act to fol-
low, but Martinelli was up to the 
chaUenge when the Tritons opened 
with six runs in the first two inni ngs 
and cmised to a 7·1 victory in the 

and we took it to them." 
The victory was the Tritons' 

fifth·straight, and it set up a tough 
road match Sarurday at UC 
Riverside. 

The Tritons found the Division 
I Highlanders to be no problem at 
all, easily disposing of Riverside 6-
I. 

In doubles action, 
Wilson/Schroeter dropped a 6·8 
decision to UC Riverside's No. I 
doubles team, Brent DavislVValt 
Hern. 

Howc\'er, the Triton duos of 
Meyer/Albrecht and Amir 
Nejad/Swatt swept the final two 
doubles matches from the 
Highlanders 8-2 and 8-4, respec-
tively. 

In singles pl ay, Wil son-
Hayden'S loss to UCR's Dan 
Stcvens was the only speed bump in 
the way of UCSD's momenrum; 
the Tritons swept the fivc other 
singles matches. 

Playing at No. I, Meye r easil y 
dispatched Davis 6-1, 6- 1. Swart

struggled a bit against UC R's 
Derek Betyar befo re eventuall y 
grabbing a three·set victory, 7-5, 5-

After Wilson-Ilayden's loss at 
the No. 4 spot, Novak and 
Schroeter closed out the UCSD 
victory with two double-bagel wins 
over Paul Chop pi and Paul 
Pantapalangkoor at the No. 5 and 
No.6 positions, respectively. 

This victory marked the sixth-
straight for the Tritons and the 
end of the regular season. UCSD 
finished the season 18-3 and 
heads into the playoffs with co nfi-
dence stemming from its recent 
success. 

"We have a lot of momenrurn 
and we are ready," said Sean 
Higginbotham. 

This Triton team is poised for a 
champio nship run and is anxious to 
get the pl ayoffs started. T he 
Tritons have come a long way after 
a 10- 10 record last year. 

"We added a lot more depth this 
year with quality freshmen," 
Wilson said. "We atso want it 
more; I can't wait for the playoffs." 

The NCAA regional playoffs 
are slated to begin May 3 at a loca-
tion to be determined. 

second leg of the doubleheader. 
On a day that appeared to be 

scripted for the seniors' farewell to 
Triton Softball Stadium, the hero-
ines should be no surprise. Hayes 
drove in a run in the first inning and 
then stayed in a rundown long 
enough for a second run to score, 
while malcing it safely to second base 
herself. Martinelli came to the plate, 
and - needing no help from a 
strength-training program 
launched a home run to center field. 

The UCSD seniors all a!.rreed 
that they couldn't have gone out any 
better way. 

"I'm just really proud of every-
body, especially the seniors, " 
Anderson said. "I know how far the 
four of us have come as a class." 

Hayes agreed with Anderson. 
"We played hard and I think the 

important thing is that we played for 
each other this time," Hayes said. 
"All of us did so great, and we strung 
out hits together, which is awesome." 

Leaving home behind, where the 
Tritons have gone 16-8 this season, 
UCSD hi5S the road where it has 
played close to ,500 ball all year. The 
Tritons will play cnlcial games in the 
Cal State Bakers6eld Mountain Dew 
Classic next weekend before closing 
their season with a pair of conrer· 
ence doubleheaders May 3 to May 4.

Track and field qualifies four 
Tritons face Olympians and professionals in meet 
By KErTH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD track and fi eld, despite 
competing amid over 2,000 
Olympian, professional and top-level 
collegiate athletes, rurned in several 
excellent performances at the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational at 
Claremont College on Friday. 

The meet, which works in con· 
junction with the concurrent Mt. 
San Antonio Relays at Mt. San 
Antonio College, fearured several 
American and international 
Olympian, professional club and 
Division I collegiate athletes. Among 
the high-profile collegiate programs 
represented were Notre Dame, 
Stanford, Michigan, Oregon, UCLA 
and Wisconsin. 

"It was pretty amazing," said 
head coach Tony Salerno. "You 
wouldn't think that with a little 
school like [Claremont], but it was 
in conjunction with the [Mt. SAC 
Relays], and that was huge. It was 
pretty much the whole nation and 

part of the world that was in the 
area for track and field. " 

UCSD took about two-thirds of 
the complete team to the nonscoring 
meet, wi th an emphasis on the track 
events, according to Salerno. 

The coaching sta ff opted to rest 
several of dle field athletes, including 
the Tritons' three National 
Collegiate Athletic Association qual-
ifiers in the throwing events: Rob 
Ewanio in the men's shot put, Sara 
Allsup in the women's discus, and 
Megan Bergin in the women's ham-
mer throw. 

Coupled with the competitive 
field, Salerno said the team stiU man· 
aged to post several outstanding indio 
vidual perfonnances, including four 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association qualifying marks. 

"I don't know if too many of our 
kids are intimidated," Salerno said. 
"Our kids are used to going to meets 

. Oike this]. In tracIc and field, the 
nature of the sport [is that] you can 
see anybody there, from Division ill 
athletes to Olympians. Its really for-

tunate for us to have a meet like this 
and then go to national-level compe-
titions, because we're used to the 
high level of competition." 

Jon Wong improved on his 
NCAA qualification time with a 
3 :52.22 in the 1,500-meter nm, the 
seventh best in the nation and the 
best mark in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association this 
year. More impressively, it was in a 
field that included 2000 Olympian 
and three-time NCAA champion, 
Gabe Jennings of Stanford 
University, fonner NCAA champion 
Clyde Colenso of South Africa and 
meet record·holder Brandon Strong 
of Ariwna State University. 

Audrey Sung, a 2001 All· 
American in the 3,000 meters, added 
another NCAA bid to her resume to 
go along with her qualifications in the 
3,000 and 5,000. She posted a 4:40.89 
in the 1,500·meter run for UCSD.

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

The Triton baseball team ven· 
rured to Cal State Stanislau last 
weekend, seven games out of first 
place and seeking to regain the 
momcnrunl it had before spring 
break. 

In the first game against the 
Warriors, UCSD won 3-2. 

The Warriors came out early 
and scored two runs in the bottom

on in the fourth when UCSD first 
baseman Chad Addison doubled to 
center field. Third baseman Keith 
Albrecht then tripled to center field 
and scored Addison.

si ngled through the left side of the 
infield. Freshman shortstop Keith

the ninth inning. 

Bologna finished the day 3 ·for-
5, with an RBI and a run, 

Smith lasted seven innings for 
UCSD, but Triton closer James

induced a double play upon enter· 
ing in the eighth to earn his first 
win of 2002. Stanislaus' Eric Fagan 
pitched a complete game in the loss 
and fell to 4·6.

the first inning. For UCSD, Smith 
scored off of an error by Warriot 
pitcher Scott Taylor. The Warriors 
got on the board when DeVault

Warrior left fielder Colter 
Bissell , who went 4-for·4 in the 
game, scored in the bottom of the 
second, and Stanislaus struck 
again in the fourth when center 
fielder Alan Dunn scored off 
shortstop Kyle Dennis' single up 
the middle. 

UCSD's Bologna kept the 
Tritons in the game when he 
blasted a home run over the left 
field fence in the top of the fifth 
inning. . 

Stanislaus closed out the game 
with another run in the eighth 
inning, taking game two of the 
series 4·2 . . 

Triton pitcher Andy Hanau 
acquired the loss for UCSD and 
fell to 3 -4 while Cal State 
Stanislaus' Taylor went the full 
nine innings and improved to 3-3 .

Warriors 8-5. 

Triton senior ace John Beaven 
went four and one-third innings to 
earn the win and improve to 6-4, 
while Sanders picked up his sixth 
save of the year. Warrior Justin 
Schwitters got the loss and fell to 2·7 
after he surrendered seven runs on 
nine hits after just 3.2 innings of play. 

Stanislaus' Findley continued to 
have a successful series, going 2· 
for-4 in the game with three RBIs. 
But his work alone could not over· 
come the Triton's power surge in 
the tOP of the fourth . 

UCSD second baseman Matt 
Merrifield began the inning with a 
single to center field , he then 
advanced to second on a wild pitch. 
Hernandez walked and Bologna 
doubled to left field . He advanced 
to third on the throw, thus scoring 
both Hernandez and Merrifield. 
Smith singled to left field and 
drove in Bologna. 

Designated hitter Jeff Riddle 
doubled to left cemer and Smith 
scored on the play. Immediately 
following, Albrecht doubled down 
the left field line and knocked in 
Riddle. Right fielder David Hawk 
drew a walk, and Merrifield 
reached on an error. Albrecht then 
scored on a wild pitch. 

Bologna went 8-for-13 in the 
series and greatly contributed to 
the offensive explosion that boost-
ed UCSD past the Warriors in the 
third game of the series. 

Cal State Stanislaus fell to 8-23 
after the series. 

The Tritons improve to 20-15 
in tlle CCAA and will play their last

was the runner-up to winner 
University of Southern Califorrua. 

Before the opening tip-off, 
UCSD honored graduating seniors 
Emma Kudritzki and Courtney 
Hemmerly \vith bouquets of Aowe;s 
and a warm reception. ' 

Both are pivotal assets to this 
powerful Triton team. Kudritzki is 
a Division .II All-American and 
two-ti me All-WWPA selection 
while Hemmerly is a four-year 
staTter who averaged 29 goals per 
season during her career. 

The Tritons jumped ahead early

two SDSU goals in the first half. 
After Silverman added another 

goal to make the score 6-3 in the

the Triton offensive attack. 
Prestegard and sophomore Holly 
Hartzell each tallied a goal, and 
UCSD's lead quickly shrank to a 
single goal with a 6-5 lead heading 
into the final period. 

The teams struggled to find the 
back of the cage in the fourrh period, 
but the Aztecs' pressure defense con-
tained the Tritons and SDSU took 
the lead for the first time with two 
goals by Hartzell, including a con-
troversial allowed goal by the referee 
late in the period. The Tritons seem-

Going into the weekend, the Roadrunners of

senior pitcher Leea Harlan. 
Hopes quickly faded, however, when 

Bakersfield scored an lmearned run in the top of 
the first inning and scraped out a run in the sec-
ond to take a 2-0 lead. UCSD put runners on base 
against Roadrunner pitcher Erin Kelly, but failed 
to advance a runner past second base for five 
innings . 

Amy Mettee scored the Tritons' only run of 
the night when she scored in the sixth on a sacri-
fice fly by Harlan. Kelly finished witll a five-hit

some insurance runs to win 6-\. 

In the second game, UCSD looked to sa lvage
