Health Handbook Ready I~~~~~~at h~~be~~~I~init~~vt~~~~i~The 

It new pharmacy and an around - the -
clock nursing staff to answer calls and 
administer first aid are now in operation at 
the Student Health Center. located on the 
Matthews campus. 

The pharmacy will be similar to those on 
the other UC campuses. Prescriptions can 
be filled by a registered pharmacist at the 
Health Center for a nominal service 
charge. 

Each time a student visits the pharmacy 
after seeing a Health Service doctor. all of 
his prescriptions will be filled for a total of 
2.50. This service fee ma~' be charged to 

his account. but if he can pay cash it will be 
reduced to $2. 

Pre cription refills may be reque ted b~' 
the Health enter doctor at no extra 
charge to the student. Onl~' pre criptions 
authorized b~' a Hea lth en'ice physician 
can be filled at the tudent Health enter 

pharmac~· . 

If a student requires continuing 
m dication. involving large quantities for a 
peri(x!'\onger than a month . he ma~' obtain 
hi pre ription at a di count rate and the 
2.SO rvice fe will not appl~·. 

en'ice charge will also be made for 
1110 t prescribed injection . but uch non-
pre ription drug a aspirin and cold 
tablet will be a\"ailable free at all time to 
tudent . Public healtb problem . 

including venera I disease. will be treated 
for no charge. 

A registered nurse will be on duty 
weekdays after 5 p.m. and all day on 
weekends and holidays. Students mav 
either call her at 453-2697 for advice on any 
medical problem or see her at the Health 
Center for help or first aid treatment. In 
case of emergencies. she may either 
contact the Health Center doctor on call or 
arrange for admissions to the infirmary or 
hospital. 

To describe its role in the college 
communitv and make available some 
important' first aid information. the 
Student Health Center will distribute a 
health handbook . Included are the details 
on the various services it performs and 
the costs of each ervice. 

Another topic dealt with is the new 
supplemental in urance po l ic~' covering all 
registered student . Thi policy. which i 
alread~' in effect. ha been negotiated with 
the Continental Ca ualty Company of 
Chicago. To be ure all medical ex pen e 
are covered. the student hould report to 
the center before conSUlting an out ide 
doctor. 

For the dep ndent of tudent . a n w 
optional in uranc policy ha been written 
and is available to eligible applicant until

U.e.Undergoing Audit 
many UC officials, who fear 
the informa tion will be used to 
justify further cuts in the 
University's already depleted 
budget. 

Arabic Classes Available 
One and possibly two new 

courses will be offered this 
quarter in Arabic literature. 
Arabic 1 (course code 6248-G 
Salinger, lecture M-W-F 9-10 
HL 1525) is being offered as an 
introduction to the language of 
classical and modern Arabic 
literature. The text used is 
available in the bookstore, 
Students interested in this 
course should contact Dr. 
Salinger in office 1034 HL. 

Orr. UC may dispute the 
auditors' findings but cannot 
change them. 

"This is just a chance to say 

Arabic 2 wi II be offered in the 
winter and Arabic 100 in the 
spring. 

There exists a strong 
possibility that the Literature 
Department will also be able to 
offer Arabic 199, Special 
Studies, for the fall . Students 
interested should register for 
Readings in Classical Arabic 
and contact the Literature 
Department after Monday, The 
extension is 1226. 

'here it is fellas ,' and then talk 
about it", Soderberg said. "But 
we're still going to send our 
findings to the director. ' , 

According to the LOS 
ANGELES TIMES, the 
University of California, is 
currently undergoing the most 
rigorous state audit in its 
history. Sixteen auditors from 
the Depar tment of Finance 
have made frequent visits to 
the nine UC campuses in recent 
months. They are preparing a 
report which will be submitted 
to Verne Orr, Director of 
Finance, by Nov. 1. 

Finance Department audits 
of the state colleges are 
routine, since the state colleges 
operate on a line item budget. 
This means each item in the 
budget must be approved by 
the appropriate legislative 
committees and by the Finance 
Department before money is 
spent. 

Paul Saltman, Provost of 
Revelle College. told the 
TIMES " We've taken the 
position tha t individual faculty 
members have different 
workloads and there's no way 
to get around it because that's 
intelligent handling of our r ................... ... 
resources. But that 's a hard 

But in the past , the 
University of California, while 
subject to intensive review by 
the Legislature and the 
Finance Department, has had 
quite a bit of flexibility in 
spending its state 
appropriation. 

The new audit, according to 
William Tormbley of the LOS 
ANGELES TIMES , has 
aroused apprehension among 

point to make with an auditor." 
Richard Soderberg. chief of 

the audit division of the 
Finance Department. said the 
large-scale inquiry was 
ordered by Orr " to get a 
clearer picture ,of the 
University 'S management 
operations ." Such a 
management audit would not 
look into curriculum or course 
content, but would cover such 

~reas as faculty teaching load, 
library operations, university-
wide purchasing practices and 
billing procedures at UC 
hospitals. 

The final report, now being 
prepared, will be reviewed by 
UC administrators before it is 
submitted to Finance Director

Pe ..... imi,ti!" \1('I1"I",",,"im';" rate . POinting to the (probably I 

temporary decline of the birth 
rate as an indication of the end 
of the population explosion is a 

by James C. Baker short . sighted disservice to 
humanity. 

In light of the many recent 
articles and stories on the 
declining birth rate in the U.S .. 
it is time for a review of the 
facts . First. it must be 
emphatically sta ted that no 
co mpetent proponent of 
population stabilization -
including Paul Ehrlich has ever 
uggested coercive methods. 

such as putting contraceptives 
in public water supplies. It has 
been noted that this is a 
possibility that the government 
may take in the face of a 
population · pollution crisis in 
the absence of voluntary 
control. but in no case is it to blf 
a preferred action. 

The suggestion tha t the 
population explosion is over 
due to the all· time low birth 
rate is no less than a facile over 
. simplification of the facts. It 
is true that the U.S. birth rate 
has hit record lows (about 16 
per thousand per year) for 
brief periods recently. but the 
death rate is at about 9 per 
thousand per year. which would 
stil l give a population doubling 
time of around 100 years. 
(Birth rates are subject to 
short·term fluctuations - since 
1968 the long term trend has 
been upward .) And due to the 
large number of people in the 
critical age group 120-30 1 of 

The vast majorit~ of the 
population growth I total 
numbers. not rate I is due to 
babies from white. middle· 
cia ss American families . 
simply because there are so 

, many of them. The poor 
produce fewer than one· third of 
the babies born each veal'. and 
the non·whites fewer than 20 
percent. Also. both of these 
groups have higher infant 
mortality rates than middle · 
class whites. and necessarily 
consume and pollute less a's 
individuals. 

As for the suggestion that our 
low populati on density 
(relative to the etherlands. or 
Denmark . for instance I means 
that we can handle a much 
larger population. the facts are 
otherwise. Population density 
is generally one of the least 
important considerations in 
determining optimum total 
population. Factors such as I I 
the quality of soils and the 
a ssocia ted a bil i ty of the land to 
produce food : 2 ) the 
avaitabilitv of non·renewable 
resources." such as metals and 
fossil fuels ; and 3) the per· 
capita consumption of the 
population are much more 

reliable indicators of' over . 
population. 

Roughly speaking. over i5 
percent of the land mass of 
Western Europe is potentially 
tillable. in contrast to less than 
45 percent for ;\'orth and 
Central America . The 
:\etherlands imports 63 percent 
of its cereals. 70 percent of its 
peas . beans . and other 
legumes. and is the world' s 
second largest per·capita 
importer of protein I mostly 
oilseed cakes and fish meal !. 
Denmark is the world 's large t 
per'capita importer of protein 
- 240 pounds per year per 
person. three times the 
average annual consumption of 
each Dane (the majority is for 
livestock feed. a verv 
inefficient use of the protein . . 

The Netherlands imports 57 
percent of its energy 
producing fuels. and 100 
percent of its iron. copper. 
manganese , bauxite , tin . 
chromium. nickel. silver. 
tungsten . vanadium, zinc. 
phosphate. potash. asbestos. 
and industrial diamonds. In 
addition . the average 
Dutchman lives at a 
consumption level 38 percent 
that of the average American. 
and the environmental impact 
of a population is the product of 
that population and the 
consumption level. 

The U.S. consumes about 40 
percent of the world's total 
natural resources with onlv 6 
percent of the population: A

Students' InternatiPRal Meditation Society 
by Jeffrey Quinn 

Students' International Meditation Society (SIMS ) claims to 
have started a revolution - a silent revolution via the 
technique of Transcendental Meditation ITM). Maharishi 
Mahesh Yq,gi is the man who brought TM out of the Himalayas 
to the whole world . Maharishi started the I nterna tional 
Meditation Society in 1959. and SIMS began in 1965 at UCLA . 
The movement is growing at a rate of 300 per cent per year 
with 75.000 members on campuses throughout the world. It is a 
silent revolution because change is gained without an~ 
accompan~ing noise or violence. TM brings about the change. 

It is an individual technique of experiencing subtler levels of 
thought until thought is transcended and the source of creative 
intelligence is reached . It is purely a mental practice. but has 
corresponding physical results. They are : reduced metabolic 
rate. increased skin resistance. and a change in brain waves. 
These changes all indicate the body is gaining deep rest. deeper 
than sleep . 

By infusing more creative intelligence and deep rest into 
their lives practitioners of TM say they eliminate all stress and 
tension. TM is practiced twice each day. fifteen minutes in the 
morning and again in the evening . The technique is automatic 
and effortless. requiring no special belief or abilit~ . Meditators 
say that anyone who can think can meditate . 

. . More Activity Anticipated 
SIMS has been on this campus for three years. In those three 

years their numbers and activities have been small but they 
hope to increase the activity in 1971-i2. Cathie Cooper. a 
teacher of Transcendental Meditation. is now a student on the 
J ohn Muir campus. To become a teacher of TM one must

complete a three month training course under the direct 
supervision of Maharishi. Miss Cooper completed the program 
at Estes Park. Colorado in December. 1970. She is majoring In 
the Science of Creative Intelligence. a course that MaharishI 
designed . Maharishi says that the source of creative 
intelligence is the basis of all fields of study. 

Goal : Holistic Education 
Science of Creative Intelligence I SCI I combines an 

. intellectual and scientific understanding of creative 
intelligence with its personal unfolding through TM. to fulfill 
the ideal of a holistic educa tion . Participating at a recent 
symposium on SCI were such respected men as Nobel Prize· 
winner Melvin Calvin from Berkeley. Dean Brown from 
U ESCO. Buckminister Fuller and Major General Franklin 
M. Davis of the U.S. Army War College. CI is currently being 
taught as an accredited course at C Santa Cruz. Sacramento 
State. Yale . Colorado and others. 

SIMS feels that TM will grow on campus for two reasons. 
One is that as more people begin to enjoy meditating they Will 
tell their friends about it. and second is the increasing interest 
that science is showing in TM. Research has been undertaken 
at Harvard and UCLA Medical Schools. the Stanford Research 
Institute. the Hershev Research Center and a number of other 
institutions. TM seems to be changing many people' lives. 
both mentally and physica lly. and the physiological and 
psychological sciences are interested. 

Cathie Cooper will begin a course on TM wi th an introductory 
lecture on Oct. i at 8 p.m. in the Informal Lounge behind the 
Revelle Cafeteria. There is no charge or obligation. SIMS holds 
lectures on a regular basis throughout an Diego County and 
more information can be obtained by calling 442-3938.

In their fi rst album since the 
release of .. Volunteers" a bout 
a year-and-a-half ago, the 
Airplane now has "Bark" 
added to its credits. There have 
been some changes in the 
group ' s personnel since 
"Volunteer ." They could be 
followed by watching the 
players on the Airplan'! oriented 
groups, Hot Tuna and the 
Jefferson Starship. The latter 
produced an album last winter 
which was essentially the 
original Airplane band , minus 
Marty Balin, with an additional 
cast of superstars (including 
the likes of Dave Crosby, Jerry 
Garcia, and Graham Nash). 
What happened to Marty? 

The lastest Hot Tuna album, 
entitled appropriately 
"Electric Hot Tuna," had JA 
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen 
abandoning his acoustic used 
on the previous Hot Tuna 
album, and new-member Papa 
John Creach on the amplified 
violin. So the course was 
charted for Balin's absence and 
Creach's inclusion.

Airplane. Al though it wou ld 
have been difficul t to fo llow 
" Volunteers" (which is truly a 
classic) with anything short of 
Heaven's own choir spaced on 
the hallucinogen of its choice. I 
still cannot he lp being 
disappointed wi th "Bark." The 
latter is not a bad album by the 
J A; but. in hearing it. there is 
nothing there that they haven' t 
a Iready done before on 
preceding records. All that we 
Airp lane freaks can do is hope 
for something new and better 
- and keep listening to 
"Surrealistic Pillow". 

Nostalgia Revisited 
One of the albums which 

seemed to make the biggest 
splash (and subsequently. the 
biggest fade-oull this past 
summer was "Surf 's Up." by 
the Beach Boys. Probably a 
result of the promo men doing 
their homework. this album 
was presented as the incarnate 
of the old Beach Boys. and as it 
were. the "new" Beach Boys. 
So dramatic was this 
presentation. that I couldn' t 
help but think back on certain 
political columnists in 1968 
referring to the "new" Nixon. 
Well. presumably. the idols of 
the 1?63 Malibu/woodie/sun-

bleached hair / board-under-
arm syndrome have emerged 
from the darkest of the late 
Sixties and early Seventies 
having seen the light (dope. 
radica I politics. ecology. ad 
nauseam). 

New Awaremess 
Such songs as .. UOn-t Go 

Near the Water" ("Toothpaste 
and soap will make our oceans 
a bubble bath/So let's avoid an 
ecological aftermath . . ,'.) and 
" Student Demonstration 
Time" ( .. America was stunned 
on May 4. 1970/ When rally 
turned to riot at Kent State 
University ... ") are 
demonstrative of their new 
awareness . Their music has 
grown somewhat more 
sophisticated as well: but 
somehow I can' t overcome the 
feeling that the Boys haven't 
really changed that much. 

The harmonies are great. and 
where the music itself lacks 
i nn ovations. the 
instrumentation is modernized 
by the extensive use of the 
Moog synthesizer. Despite the 
cliche-ridden lyrics at times 
and the hype which, of course, 
doesn' t tell the full story. 
"Surf's Up" is a good fun 
album.

PAT STACY 
.The Intramural Department has come up with the most 

nghteous sport ever! It 's coed football , and it's guaranteed to 
be a kick-and-a-half. If you think it isn 't a blast to watch four 
girls and four guys try to playas a flag football team in a game 
governed by some of the most ridiculous rules ever to grace a 
rule book, just try it ... that 's right, just round up four dudes 
and 4 chicks, make it on over to Lee Johnson's office and sign 
up. 

.Yes, folks , everybody 's favorite coed team, the Teen Angels , 
will be back , bigger and better than ever. Rumor has it that 
" Naked" Peter Halstorf is leading a crew of no less than 36 
Ang~ls up to the Brown Derby Brewing Factory to get fully 
OUtfitted with the "equipment" which will assure them of 
another winning season - whether they score a touchdown all 
year or not ! With all those people the Teen Angels could easily 
split into two teams and double everyone's fun . and when those 
two teams met - WOW ... that would be everyone's dream 
game ! 

Getting in on the first scrimmage action of the year were the 
Yuba City Goosers and the coed version of DeAnza . Although 
the Goosers were basically operating a one-play offense ("hike 
the ball a.nd we 'll fake it "), they did manage to pull a deceptive 
center-ehglble play from curvaceous Carol Heineman to 

s~e,dy Dave Phillips. Marsha, Earlene, Jimmy Paul, and 
Wllhe ran some frantic reverses for the DeAnza bunch and 
show great promise for later this season . 

For guys who prefer a little more serious brand of football 
men 's nag football teams are also forming. Freshmen and 
other newcomers of both sexes will probably find that more 
peo.ple participate in intramural sports than in any other single 
aCllvity on campus. Besides offering a welcome change of pace 
to the "study blues" and preventing one's body from wasting 
away, intramurals offers a great chance to make a lot of new 
friends , both male and female . In the fall , it 's flag football ; 
captains, the team meeting is today at 4 p.m. in the Physical 
Educahon classroom. If your roster is not quite complete, no 
hassle, but . make sure you're there today because playing 
schedules Will be orgamzed. If you have any questions , see Lee 
Johnson in the Intramural Office or call X2284.
