UCSD Chancellor Pradeep K. 
Khosla announced the appointment 
of Pierre Ouillet as UCSD’s first Vice 
Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer 
last week. Ouillet was hired following 
the conduction of an international 
search and, as of now, is set to join 
UCSD in November 2014.

In a statement dated Oct. 6, 
Khosla wrote that the university 
hopes that Ouillet’s tenure in his 
new position as Vice Chancellor and 
CFO will aid in reaching the goals 
set forth by Chancellor Khosla’s 
Strategic Plan, issued earlier this fall. 
These goals include enhancing the 

financial stability of the university 
through the effective use of new 
and existing revenue. Furthermore, 
the university hopes that Ouillet 
will create an integrated multiyear, 
multifund financial plan also based on 
components of the Strategic Plan.

As the senior executive officer for all 
of UCSD’s financial resources, Ouillet’s 
duties unite several key areas of UCSD’s 
budget management: the campus 
budget office, financial analysis office;, 
business and financial services;, human 
resources;, operational and strategic 
initiatives;, real estate;, administrative 
computing and telecommunications;, 
and housing, dining and hospitality.

Last year, the UCSD Budget Office 
estimated the total budget to have been 
nearly $4 billion, including both the 

figures for the main campus and the 
medical center.

“Ouillet has extensive experience 
managing large budgets, building 
high performance teams and driving 
change in complex organizations,” 
Chancellor Khosla said in his Oct. 6 
announcement.

Ouillet last worked as the Vice 
President of Finance, Resources and 
Operations for the University of British 
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. 
He left that position in September 
after five years of employment. While 
at UBC, Ouillet oversaw the largest 
Student Housing and Hospitality 
operation in Canada, with more than 
12,000 beds in mixed use facilities. 
As VP of Finance, he similarly was

After a year of collaborative 
effort between University Centers 
and other campus organizations, 
UCSD’s new Graffiti Art Park is 
scheduled to open today at the Old 
Student Center.

Located between Porter’s Pub 
and Mandeville Center, the park 
features eight double-sided, wooden 
billboards for artists to paint their 
work. According to the park’s 
website, the project was inspired 
by a visit to Writerz Blok, a creative 
center in southeastern San Diego, 
although many students have been 
advocating for a dedicated art space 
since the last school year. 

In early September 2013, 
the decades-old Graffiti Hall 
in Mandeville Center was 
surreptitiously removed, upsetting 
proponents of free expression at 
UCSD. A nonbinding referendum 
in the Spring Quarter 2014 general 
elections asked students if they 
supported “reinstating a Graffiti 
Art Space on campus,” receiving 
an overwhelming 92-percent “yes” 
vote. 

UCEN previously held two 
“Graffiti Hill” events at the Old 
Student Center in February and 
May, respectively. The university 
provided blank billboards and spray 
paint at the Hump, also near the 
Old Student Center, which allowed 
students to once again create art 
installations in a safe and free 
environment. The success of these 
two events gave credence to the idea 
of a permanent art installation on 
campus.

Kyle Heiskala, the A.S. 
representative to the Campus 
Planning Committee and a leading 
advocate for Graffiti Art Park, 
explained that students and school 
administrators began looking for 
a suitable replacement for Graffiti 
Hall at the urging of previous A.S. 
President Andy Buselt. 

“There aren’t many empty spaces 
left on campus, and what is empty is 
usually designated for something,” 
Heiskala said. “We wanted 
something relatively close to the 
original Graffiti Hall, so we started 
looking near the student center.”

He added that the project 
was not the result of just a single 
organization’s efforts. The Open 
Space Committee, along with 
UCEN and campus landscape 
architect Todd Pitman, worked 
closely together with A.S. Council

Trial Date Set for Che Cafe

Representatives for the Che Cafe and University of California Regents will be back in court on Wednesday after Katherine 
A. Bacal, judge of the Superior Court of San Diego 
County, set the trial opening date for the Cafe’s 
lawsuit against the UC Regents. The announcement 
came at a preliminary meeting on Friday, Oct. 10.

Che Cafe attorney Bryan Pease said he had 
hoped that the judge would grant a formal hearing 
disputing the Master Space Agreement — the 
terms of the rental lease between the Che Cafe 
Co-operative and the university. Additionally, the 
Che Cafe hopes that upcoming court dates will 
discredit the Graduate Student Association’s June 
decertification of the Che Cafe, as well as the 
University Centers Advisory Board’s decision in 
May to exclude funding for repairs to the Che Cafe 
from the 2014-15 fiscal year budget.

“The basis of our defense is that the university 
wants the collective to comply with the MSA,” Pease 
said. “The university should have to play by the 
same rules and procedures.”

During the hearing, Pease requested a bench 
trial procedure — a trial not involving a jury — 

in which the judge would examine the MSA to 
determine whether or not the Che Cafe Co-op 
followed the procedures denoted in the agreement 
and thus, if the eviction of the Co-op was legitimate. 
Both parties waived their right to a jury trial in the 
interest of time.

Pease said that the dispute will likely be resolved 
in next Wednesday’s trial.

“If the judge in this trial determines that the 
GSA vote was necessary for the eviction to proceed, 
then we should ... take everything on submission 
to have a full hearing on our challenge to the GSA 
vote not being supported by substantial evidence 
and done in a manner that’s in accordance to the 
law,” Pease said. “[The trial] probably won’t be 
continued and we probably will get a ruling one 
way or another next week.”

Pease added that the judge will either rule in 
favor of the Co-op by stating that the university 
has not and does need to go through the resolution 
procedures for disputes as specified in the MSA, or 
will rule in favor of the UC Regents and give the 
Che Cafe Co-op a time frame of when it needs to 
vacate the space.

A.S. Concerts & Events launched 
its new Triton Fest program on Oct. 
10, a new series of events geared at 
promoting student spirit and safety. 
The events will continue to take place 
every Friday and Saturday night for 
the remainder of October and will 
feature different activities each time.

Associate Vice President of 
ASCE Seraphin Raya told the UCSD 
Guardian that many groups on 
campus saw the need for larger scale 
programming and that ASCE created 
Triton Fest to respond to that need 
and to build a sense of pride and 
community at UCSD.

Raya said that another goal of 

Triton Fest is to provide activities 
for students to do over the weekend. 
According to the results of multiple 
surveys, students continually report 
wanting more to do on Fridays and 
Saturdays.

A key aspect of Triton Fest that 
ASCE wanted to emphasize is that it 
does not put students at risk of alcohol 
consumption or hospitalization. 
ASCE hopes that students will go to 
Triton Fest instead of participating in 
other events that involve those risks.

In the long-term, ASCE wants 
Triton Fest to become a campus 
tradition, possibly by expanding into 
the winter and spring quarters.

According to Raya, the first 
two nights of Triton Fest were 
outstanding. More students turned 
out than anticipated and ASCE has 

received a lot of positive feedback.
On the first Friday of Triton Fest, 

ASCE transformed UCSD into the 
Triton Obstacle Challenge, a mile-
long race composed of eight inflatable 
obstacle courses that stretched from 
Sun God Lawn to Ridgewalk. The 
event included free food, graffiti 
cubes, alcohol education stations and 
additional inflatable games.

On Saturday, Triton Fest hosted 
the UCSD Grand Prix, in which 
ASCE converted Rupertus Lane 
into a go-kart track. Two DJs were 
stationed in Matthews Quad where 
students brought their headphones, 
tuned into their online stations and 
danced. Students were also able to 
participate in a variety of arcade 
games and classic games such as giant 
Jenga and giant Twister.

This upcoming Friday night’s 
event will be a Streetside Cinema 
in which ASCE will screen both 
Anchorman and Guardians of the 
Galaxy, with a performance by 
indie rock band Finish Ticket in 
between. The next day, students 
will get to decide who makes San 
Diego’s best tacos at the UCSD Taco 
Throwdown.

During the final weekend of 
Triton Fest, events will feature a 
Comedy Fest on Friday night and 
a   Haunted Hoedown on Saturday 
night, which includes a haunted 
trail, a costume contest, line 
dancing, carnival games, live music 
and a variety of other activities.

New ASCE-Sponsored TritonFest Holds Inaugural Programs

to formulate the plans and logistics 
for what would eventually become 
Graffiti Art Park. 

The grand opening itself was 
less publicized than the previous 
Graffiti Hill events but was meant 
to be a more “organic” event that 
would catch the eyes of students as 
they walked by. The billboards will 
be repainted every quarter, allowing 

for new art to be created as the year 
progresses. 

As a pilot program, the future 
of Graffiti Art Park will depend 
on how well students themselves 
maintain the space. Failure to 
uphold the community guidelines 
will impact UCEN’s willingness to 
develop any other projects similar 
to Graffiti Art Park. Artists are 
expected to keep the park clean 
and to respect each other’s work. 

They can report abuses to  artpark.
ucsd.edu. 

“I have great hopes for [the 
park]. I think the students will be 
very enthusiastic and take it upon 
themselves to make sure the space is 
used respectfully,” Heiskala said. “It’s a 
great addition to the campus because 
there really isn’t any other place like it.”

budget, $6 billion in capital assets and 
$3 billion in financial assets. 

Khosla’s release also noted that 
Ouillet helped UBC absorb the impact 
of the global financial crisis and a 
decline in public funding, such as 
cuts in provincial grants and caps on 

domestic tuition, by realizing annual 
savings and new revenues through 
close collaboration with faculty.

Prior to working at UBC, Ouillet 
was employed as the Vice President 
of Finance for Best Buy International 
and Best Buy Canada. For these 
corporations, he managed $16 billion 
and $6 billion in revenues, respectively.

In addition, Ouillet has held 

several other leadership roles in the 
private sector with organizations such 
as McKinsey & Company and Roger 
Wireless, and in 2012, Ouillet was 
recognized for his success through 
a nomination for the Robert Half 
“Canada’s CFO of Year” award.

Council 
Should Use 
Resolutions 
Sparingly 

soren  nelson 
senelson@ucsd.edu

point of order

22. No, I’m not talking about 
the Taylor Swift song. That is the 
remarkable number of resolutions 
that A.S. Council passed last year. It 
hasn’t always been such a common 
practice. Four years ago, that number 
was 16, and four years before that, 
just four resolutions were passed. 
It’s a function of Council that has 
bred more controversy than almost 
any other. Yet to my knowledge, 
recent councils have never examined 
the practice — nor had a definitive 
conversation about how resolutions 
should really be used. I think it’s 
time we have that talk, Council.

Let’s start with what a resolution 
actually is. A.S. Council has used it 
as a way to express our support or 
disapproval of a wide range of issues, 
including transportation, social 
justice and of course, Israel and 
Palestine. However, after consulting 
the official guide to Robert’s Rules 
— the parliamentary rules to which 
Council adheres — the definition is 
much simpler than that: “A motion 
submitted in writing … either 
because of its importance or the 
length or complexity.” Anyone who 
has served on a governing body 
that uses Robert’s Rules knows that 
a motion is simply the mechanism 
by which the group takes an action. 
So it follows then that a resolution 
should be similarly action-oriented. 
They typically are not. 

For example, let’s examine the 
“Resolution in Solidarity with the 
Demonstrators in Turkey.” Leaving 
aside the content of the document — 
I don’t think anyone disagrees with 
it — it’s a perfect example of what 
I view as a resolution-gone-wrong. 
With some notable exceptions, 
most of the resolutions that come 
through A.S. Council are guaranteed 
to do two things: 1) elicit groans 
and exasperation from all but a 
few council members and 2) pass 
unanimously. This resolution was 
not one of those exceptions. And 
not only does it fall well out of A.S. 
Council’s purview as a legislative 
body but no action was taken to 
follow up on that support.

Most people support the 
demonstrators in Turkey, but a 
resolution is the wrong way to show 
that. Does that mean Council has 
no other options? Hell no. Council 
could have organized support 
on campus, written letters to our 
representatives in Congress or raised 
funds to support the demonstrators, 
just to name a few options. All 
would have had a greater effect than 
a resolution.

Someone in the upper echelons 
of UCSD’s administration once told 
me: “If you had just come to us 
before passing a resolution, we could 
have already solved this.” Council, 
you have more options. Resolutions 
should be targeted, relevant 
documents that are paired with 
tangible action — and only used 
as a last resort. The more a person 
speaks, the less people listen, and 
the same is true for A.S. Council. 
Resolutions are being overused 
and because of that they’ve lost 
their impact. If A.S. Council wants 
people to listen when it speaks, it’s 
going to need to communicate more 
effectively, and it’s time for us to 
have a serious conversation about 
how to do that. 

Protest for a Better Future

Recent developments in the Hong Kong student protests have dominated the network news cycle for the last few weeks. In an era where Hong Kongers are 
increasingly frustrated with Beijing’s encroachment on their 
civil liberties, the current protests serve as a vent for citizens 
to demonstrate their displeasures against what is becoming a 
highly oppressive regime. 

Hong Kong is known as a Special Administrative 
Region, which is run differently compared to the rest of 
China. This arrangement is known as the “one country, 
two systems” as a result of the accord between the United 
Kingdom and China during the handover conversation. 
Hong Kong would maintain its own political and 

economic system for a period of 50 years without the 
interference from China.

That outlook is certainly changing in the minds of Hong 
Kong citizens as the protest divides the public opinion. 
According to Time Magazine, “Already, many locals worry 
that China’s communist rulers are eroding the freedoms 
— like an independent judiciary and an open press — that 
differentiate the city from the rest of China.” The protest 
came as a response to Chinese interference on the selection 
of the Chief Executive, a governor position in Hong Kong. 
An event like the Hong Kong demonstrations, known 
colloquially as the “Umbrella Movement,” brings to mind 
similar events that regularly happen in the United States. 

Recent citizen demonstrations in Hong Kong showcasing the frustrations of  
citizens affected by government injustices also ring a bell for American students. 

Considering Google can make anywhere 
from 5 cents to $50 per link clicked, celebrity 
lawyer Marty Singer’s claim for $100 million seem 
gracious. Even if Google did not commit the 
crime by releasing celebrities’ private photos, the 
company enabled dozens of these nude photos to 
spread throughout the web and should be held 
responsible for doing so. 

Without Google’s large user base of 2.7 billion 
users, the scandal would not have reached such a 
widespread audience. Charles Arthur, a technology 
writer from the UK Guardian, estimated that after 
the scandal, around 7 million people were googling 
Jennifer Lawrence’s name daily. The numbers come 
out to be the same for the other big-name celebrities 
involved in the nude photo leak such as Kate Upton, 
Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens and Rihanna. 
Even simply googling “nude celebrities” offers 
62,700,000 results. 

Google can claim the company is too large 
to control every link, but then that leaves no 
explanation about how Twitter could. With around 
271 million monthly users, Twitter accommodated 
all the requests to remove pictures within a few 
hours, despite having a significantly smaller 
company than Google. This leaves no excuse for 
Google to have only removed 51 percent of the 
images after a week’s time. 

If Google refuses to remove the photos because 
it denies responsibilities, then operating under the 
company’s motto, “Do no evil” is deceitful to users. 
Although not the original perpetrator, the company 
acts as a huge enabler by continuing to allow these 
photos to be found through their popular search 
engine. Google is an accomplice in this sex crime 
and deserves to be guilty.

Google Cannot Be Held Responsible 
for Search Engine Users’ Indiscretions

Multiple Parties Were Involved in 
Perpetuating Celebgate Scandal

Google Enabled Widespread Distri-
bution of  Celebrities’ Private Photos 

Celebrity attorney Marty Singer’s $100 million 
lawsuit against Google ignores the fact that multiple 
parties were undoubtedly involved in creating and 
perpetuating the Celebgate scandal. All parties 
should be equally responsible for these nude photo 
leaks, rather than simply blaming Google alone.

4chan, the original distributor of the “not safe for 
work” photos, should primarily be blamed for the 
leak. 4chan, like Google, profits from the site traffic, 
and did not take much action to stop the spread 
of the leaked photos. Additionally, the celebrities 
themselves should be accountable for their pictures 
and understand that anything they upload to their 
computers — or iCloud in this matter — is not 
immune to hackers. 

However, 4chan and the celebrities are not the 
only ones who should be taking responsibility. 
Apple should enable tighter iCloud security to 
prevent people’s private lives from being known 
to the vast internet community. In a Sept. 17 
Huffington Post article, social media expert Chris 
Harris notes that iCloud accounts are “inevitably” 
going to be targeted by hackers because “personal 
data is becoming much more valuable and 
marketable.” Apple should make the risks of using 
its products known to their customers so that users 
will be aware and be more careful when dealing 
with such sensitive material. 

It’s clear that Google is not the only party 
responsible for the leak; without the original iCloud 
security breach, these celebrities’ photos would 
not have been breached. If sites such as 4chan had 
not posted these photos, Google’s algorithm would 
not have directed users to those websites. Several 
entities were involved, and responsibility should be 
distributed accordingly.

In the aftermath of a crime, society looks 
anxiously for some place to administer blame. 
With hundreds of celebrity photos stolen this year, 
fingers point at Google, and up to $100 million 
of compensation hangs in the balance. However 
convenient a target Google may seem, we must not 
lose sight of who really perpetuates violations of 
privacy like “Celebgate.”
     As a search engine, Google provides users with 
the tools needed to navigate the web. Users expect 
a comprehensive scope of content with minimal 
censorship, but this freedom comes with equal 
responsibility. Ultimately, the user bears culpability 
for how they use these tools and must accept all 
due blame for perpetrating violations when they 
search out and use the stolen data.
     Granted, Google owns several enormous sites, 
like Blogger and YouTube, where illegal images 
have been shared, but Google took appropriate 
actions to cull this activity. In compliance with 
and beyond the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act, Google reported that they had removed tens 
of thousands of pictures and closed hundreds of 
accounts in the span of a few hours.
     Google removes illegal content constantly; 
Reddit admins repeatedly delete “Celebgate” 
threads; Apple encourages iCloud users to keep 
passwords and security questions secure, but at 
some point we need to stop expecting higher 
powers to police us. Stop seeking out content on 
Google that violates basic human privacy; stop 
sharing dehumanizing images on Reddit; stop 
participating in “Celebgate” or similar revenge 
porn leaks in any form. If we take these steps, far 
fewer such crimes will occur, with far less damage 
to the victims.

The recent unrest in Ferguson, 
Missouri has prodded government 
officials and police to crack down 
on citizens in attempts to quell 
the demonstrations and disperse 
protesters. 

Americans, particularly U.S. 
college students, should pay 
attention to the developments in 
Hong Kong, as the current situation 
is very similar to  recent events here. 
According to U.S. News, one in six 
Americans lives at or below the 
poverty line, and wages have stayed 
stagnant for years. Students in the 
U.S. also face uphill battles in the 
fight for accessible higher education. 
On University of California 

campuses, tuition increases may 
bring the cost of attendance to 
record highs as soon as next month.

The Umbrella Movement seems 
to be an extension of the Occupy 
Movement that was popular in 
Oakland, New York and other major 
cities around the country a few years 
ago. Students were protesting about 
the income inequality that is only 
getting worse as  students fresh out 
of college are seeing less and less 
opportunities and staggering loans to 
pay back. Hong Kong is facing similar 
problems, where youth unemployment 
is relatively high at 9.4 percent while 
the general unemployment rate is 3.3 
percent, according to Ycharts. 

In March of 2012, UCSD students 
took over large parts of the campus 

to rally and protest what they saw 
as recent attacks on public higher 
education. Close to 10,000 protestors 
also swarmed the California state 
capitol and lobbied state legislators. 
Some members of the faculty and 
staff even joined in to show their 
support for the movement against the 
purported injustices. 

Many Americans, especially 
students, currently have similar 
grievances to those felt in Hong Kong 
right now. They can rest assured that 
in times of inequity and unfair actions 
on the part of the government, protest 
is one of the most powerful tools that 
citizens can employ.

Gabby Areas, UC Santa Cruz - City on a Hill Press: 
Why at this particular moment [raise the salaries] 
since the UC is facing a budget shortfall?

JN:  There’s never a good time to do it. I think one 
of the good reasons for the timing is ... because they 
were looking to approve the package for the new UC 
Irvine chancellor. As new chancellors come in, they’re 
being paid much better at other institutions because 
we’re out of line, and we want to get the very best 
chancellors that we can get, so we end up paying them 
more. Most of our chancellors have taken salary cuts 
to come to the UC, so they come, but they’re still way 
above where the chancellors are who have been with 
us a long time, so then you get that kind of disparity 
there. So the notion is, you know what? We’re the 
University of California, we compete for the best all 
over the United States and we just got way off scale.

On Sept. 29, Janet Napolitano marked the end 
of her first year as president of the University 
of California by holding a press conference in 
Oakland with UC campus newspapers to dis-
cuss issues and policies relevant to students.

Compiled by Tina Butoiu | Senior Staff Writer

Q Daniel Tutt, UC Berkeley - Daily Californian: You promised a tuition freeze for this year, but now another hike is being considered for next year because state funds are falling short. What are your plans to address this issue, and what can you tell students about whether their tuition will increase?
A JN: What I can say is that we have frozen tuition [for the] third year in a row [and] that the state allocation for the university is not what we hope. That does put heavy pressure on the tuition dollar, and therefore, in November, when the Regents meet, they’re going to have to look at a whole range of things. So I don’t want to predict what the Regents are going to do, nor do I want to predict what I’m going to propose to the Regents. But I think I’m going to 

have to be upfront with you and say that given the fact that the state, if you look at the core 
budget of the university, there’s basically two parts to it: There’s the state appropriation and 
tuition. 20 years ago, state appropriation was here, and tuition was at the top of the bucket. 
The state is putting a little bit in, but it’s by an eye dropper realistically, so at a certain point, 
we may have to look at tuition again. It’s just the arithmetic and the math. The other part I 
would add to that is that student aid remains robust. 55 percent of the undergraduates in 
California do not pay tuition; they pay nothing. They’ve got to [pay for] room and board — I 
get that — but they don’t pay tuition. And another significant percentage of that get a break 
on tuition, so the student aid formulas are not anticipated to change.

Q Tina Butoiu, UCSD - The Guardian: At UCSD in the past couple of years we’ve experienced issues with housing with overcrowding in the dorms and parking lots. What is the UC Office of the President going to do to make UC campuses more accessible and attractive to students?
A JN: Each campus has its own capital plan, and that is parking structures and buildings and dorms. I don’t specifically know what the capital plan is for UCSD. It must be a pretty attractive campus because we have a lot of applicants there and a lot of applicants that we’ve had to turn away from UCSD. It does undoubtedly have a capital plan and construc-tion in vision, and that would be handled under our executive vice president and with the 

chancellors. That’s kind of on a campus-by-campus basis.

“You know, every campus [has to take] upon 
itself and every student has to take upon him 
or herself the responsibility for how we act and 
interact with each other as a community.”

Q Joon Park, UCLA - The Daily Bruin: In previous Regents meetings, you recommended the Regents community to have a policy in which the president could recommend a docu-ment to chancellor’s compensation if the chancellor’s compensation is too low. 
A JN: Here’s the deal on that. There are 64 to 70 universities total in the U.S. that are equiva-lent to UC campuses, and our Chancellors, particularly some that have been with UC a long time, are paid like at the bottom of the scale. It’s a market. Not everyone can run one of these campuses. They’re complicated. Students are complicated. You’re compli-cated. The faculty is complicated. Some of our campuses are running hospitals and med 

schools and veterinary schools, etc., along with the undergraduate program. So these are 
big complicated institutions with billion dollar-plus 
budgets, and we pay their chancellors as if they were 
middle managers at a tech firm in San Francisco, 
and we pay them at the lowest comparative of what 
they call [Association of American Universities] 
universities. Many of the chancellors that have been 
with us for a while have been at a salary freeze for 
years. They haven’t had any increase in salary, so at 
the last meeting the Regents raised the bottom four.

Q
Phuc Pham, UC Irvine - New University: Given the rash of recently culturally insensitive 
events at campuses such as my own, UCI, and also Cal State universities, what do you 
think can be done on campuses to prevent many … particularly fraternities and sororities, 
from putting out racist events, and what would it take for there to be a similar task force 
like the ones addressing sexual assault to one addressing race?

A
JN: I just met the leadership of the Greek system at Berkeley yesterday, actually, and we had 
a great session to talk about the roles of fraternities and sororities at university life. And we 
[talked about the fact that we] have about 14 percent of our undergraduates as members 
in the Greek system and the fact that they can be a powerful force for good in the uni-
versity community, and I was impressed by their commitment to do so. You know, every 
campus [has to take] upon itself and every student has to take upon him or herself the 
responsibility for how we act and interact with each other as a community. Because these 
campuses are really communities, and we will do all we can from UCOP to support educa-
tion efforts, to support training, to support awareness and cultural sensitivity awareness in 
particular. But we cannot do this from Oakland. This really has to be [a] grassroots [move-
ment] among the students themselves with the support of Oakland as we go through the 
school year. By the way, I think the student press could be very helpful here, just saying.

Q Tina Butoiu, UCSD - The Guardian: Last year there were several protests made by the graduate student teacher’s aides regarding their salaries and their class sizes increasing. For us undergraduate students and possibly graduate students that are listening, what does the future look like if we are going to be TAs ourselves?
AJN: I think that one of the reasons I would like some more funding for the academic missions on the campus is for exactly that sort of thing. How do we improve the student faculty ratio, the TA number, class sizes? There, that actually goes into time of 

graduation. And we talked a little bit about that and 
[how to get] more students to be able to get out in four 
years. I actually think that TAs can be super helpful 
... It seems like the freshman year is so important, 
particularly for first generation students if they’re 
coming from a family background where no one 
has had a college education before in terms of what 
it takes to thrive at the UC. You know, just things 
like time management, study skills, the confidence. 
You’re admitted, you can do this work, that’s why 
we’re admitted. You can do the work, but being able 
to be in a smaller group, perhaps with a TA to focus 
efforts through that critical first year, they’re pretty 
much on a pathway, unless they’re changing majors 
or something like that. And that’s where TAs, I think, 
can be very, very helpful, so I would like to take all 
of that and shine a laser on it. When we discuss the 
budget we often talk about just numbers, and after 
a while numbers begin to sound like a Monopoly 
game, and here’s what happens ... The students say, 
“Yeah, I understand, don’t have a tuition increase.” 
... Well, what does that mean then? What does that 
mean in terms of the quality of education that we can 
get? And we have to open up that discussion. To me, 
if there’s to be any increases, those dollars need to be 
used for those kinds of purposes and nothing else. So 
go to grad school.

Spray Cans Here to Stay 
University Centers promotes today’s grand opening of the Graffiti Art Park, a new maintained space 

on campus for students to freely express public displays of art.

For the wandering artists left discouraged after last 
year’s shutdown of the campus’ beloved Graffiti Hall, a 
new sanctuary for street art will be making its grand debut 
today. Graffiti will finally have a university-approved, 
long-term home on campus in the form of several wood-
en canvases standing proudly within the Old Student 
Center’s eucalyptus grove, what University Centers is 
dubbing UCSD’s own Graffiti Art Park.

It took the unification of two separate efforts search-
ing to create a permanent space on campus for graffiti that 
managed to bring the Art Park onto its feet. University 
Centers, on one hand, at the desire of many students, 
pulled together two consecutive street art events called 
“Graffiti Hill” last Winter and Spring Quarter. At these 
events, students were welcome to decorate multiple struc-
tures covered with cellophane and were given a mountain 

of spray cans and markers with which to paint them. 
University Centers senior marketing assistant Pooja Vig 
and Art Director Armando Abundis say that the events 
served as a precursor for the Art Park by confirming that 
the student body still holds a steady interest in graffiti.

“[During the event], we did a spray-paint [unofficial 
survey asking] ‘Do you want this to be permanent?’ and 
it was totally yes; people wanted it,” Vig said. “We had 
people taking up a huge space on the cellophane and 
people weren’t even touching it because their art was 
there. People were respectful and people wanted to see 
other people’s work.”

Meanwhile, environmental systems senior and self-
proclaimed art appreciator Kyle Heiskala was in the pro-
cess of working with Gary Matthews, Vice Chancellor of 
Resource Management and Planning, to find a workable 

site on campus that could foster a space for students to 
exhibit their art freely and publicly. Heiskala functioned 
as a mediator between the students and the planning 
committee, actively working a feedback loop of ideas 
between the two until the most viable concept could be 
decided upon.

“My main motivation to work on this project was 
that I felt that Graffiti Hall was a very special, unique 
place that UCSD was proud of, added a lot of character 
to the campus and it was a place that made a lot of 
memories for people,” Heiskala said. “Then when it 
was taken away, there were a lot of students that were 
upset by that and wanted a place to express themselves 
through community art.”

Napolitano Plans to Expand Mental Health Support
▶ Q&A, from page 6

Q Peter Manatier, UC Santa Barbara - The Daily Nexus: At the July Regents meeting you touched on what happened at UC Santa Barbara and what happened on May 23, and you had mentioned in your opening remarks that UCOP and the Regents would be working toward addressing student mental health issues and Isla Vista issues in the wake of what happened here. And I guess I was wondering if you could provide any updates on those 
remarks or what is being done to [improve] student mental health issues.

A JN: Yes, I can. In fact I was just review[ing] some materials we put together. We’ve been looking at different ways to supply mental health services to all of our campuses, and in some areas we plain have a lack of providers. There aren’t enough psychiatrists and psychologists in the geographic area of the campus, and we’ve been looking at the role telemedicine can play in this arena. We’ve been looking at an approach that brings in 
social workers and general counselors as well as psychologists and psychiatrists because 
students need different levels of assistance, and there’s a lot variety during the school 
year. You can imagine during exam time, the needs go up, for example, and so we are 
kind of looking to the university as whole where we up our game where mental services 
are involved. In respect to Santa Barbara, we’ve also been working very closely with 
Chancellor Yang and the community in Isla Vista and how do we make Isla Vista a safer 
place to live. And technically, even though that’s not university property, we have to be 
realistic and say it’s associated, and it’s with the university reputationally [sic] and other-
wise, you have a lot of students and staff who live there.

Q Phuc Pham, UC Irvine - New University: Returning back to the issues of mental health and sexual assault, given the impacted budget of the UC and also the impact ... helping students with these issues ... What is a realistic time frame we can expect to see funding for new sexual assault prevention offices?
A JN  Sorry, you broke up a little bit. I didn’t hear you clearly. For which offices, please? 

Q Phuc Pham, UC Irvine - New University: The ones on UC campuses dealing with sexual assault and mental health.
A JN: Well, sexual assault, we’re gonna [sic] find that funding this year; we’re looking for it right now. Mental health will be a somewhat longer process because we are looking for a broader range of personnel and staff, and it may require a fee increase in order to pay for it so that may be something that’s longer term for additional service that we do not 

provide. That does not prevent us ever from better triag[ing], stag[ing] and deliver[ing] 
the services we do pay for right now.

The area selected to host the 
Graffiti Art Park is nestled between 
Porter’s Pub and the path to Student 
Center B. A runner-up was the grassy 
hill outside of Main Gym (where the 
previous Graffiti Hill events took 
place), but the location was reject-
ed due to various landscaping con-
cerns, including grass growing over 
the structures and possible coverage 
from the sprinkler system. Heiskala 
explained that the space next to 
Porter’s Pub was the better choice.

“It’s a visible space,” Heiskala 
said. “Since it’s in a park area, it 
only needed a special okay from 
the campus for a temporary set-up 
approval. It was chosen because of 
its availability, because it’s in a high-
traffic area and it would fit into the 
character of the space.”

Now anyone taking a leisurely 
walk past the Art of Espresso cof-
fee stand by Mandeville will be able 
to easily spot eight bright, sturdy 
structures with sheets of plywood 
boarded to them and painted white 
for canvas space. On opening day, 
free spray paint and markers will be 
provided to encourage students to 
“make their mark.” 

The structures — as well as the art 
upon them — will remain standing 
indefinitely; however, at the begin-
ning of each quarter, the plywood will 
be painted over in order to start off 
with a fresh canvas. Different student 
graffiti artists each quarter will then 
be invited to be the first to paint on 
the structures in order to start off the 
spray painting process.

“After that, it’s a free space,” 
Abundis said. “It’s not going to be 
policed; there are no cameras. The 

only thing we ask is to respect those 
guidelines [listed on the park’s web-
site] so this can really become a 
permanent space.”

While Abundis stressed that the 
permanence of the space hinges on 
the community artists’ ability to keep 
the art positive and avoid depictions 
that would offend other members of 
the community, the producers of the 
Art Park seemed confident that the 
space won’t be abused.

“It will be up to the community to 
do the self-policing,” Heiskala said. “If 
anyone is walking by and it’s offensive, 
then I would like to think that the 
university has very thoughtful-mind-
ed students that are aware of certain 
things that can be offensive and step 
up to paint over it or address that.”

“I think the students here are 
mature enough to know that this is 
something for their benefit and for 

the benefit of the campus and makes 
our campus different, and I think 
the self-policing is going to work,” 
Abundis added.

For Heiskala, the Graffiti Art Park 
is only the beginning.

“Maybe we can take the concept 
and expand it out to have more com-
munity art spaces across campus,” 

Heiskala said. “I always envision that. 
When I walk across campus I think, 
‘We could put some art there, make 
that more colorful.’ It’s always needed 
in my opinion [...] you can’t have too 
much art.”

Survival of  Graffiti Art Park Will Depend on Student Respect

Tritons hit a 0.254 (46-15-122) while 
the Otters hit a 0.209 (44-17-129). 
Both teams also managed to put out 
four blocks. 

“We clicked as a team and just 
played really well tonight,” Colla told 
the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We had a huge crowd of fans and it 
pushed us to talk and work together 
even more. It was just very special 
playing at the Reis Cup.”

Saturday saw the Tritons hit a 
season-high 0.318 attack percentage, 
leading to scores of 25–23, 25–19, 
and 25–16. The Tritons marked up 
a total of 50 kills with 15 errors 
in 110 attempts. In comparison, 
Cal State East Bay hit only 36 kills 
with 12 errors in 109 attempts. The 
Tritons also racked up 53 digs to the 
Pioneers’ 39.

Colla had a big night again, 
finishing with match-highs of 17 
points and 14 kills. She tallied her 
seventh double-double of the season 
while hitting a 0.370 with three 
services aces and 10 digs.

Brenton had another amazing 
performance, almost repeating her 
previous night’s points by scoring 
12 kills and seven digs. Dahle had 
another impressive night as well, 

hitting a 0.429 with nine kills and 
no errors. Sierks tallied up 34 assists 
and 10 digs while Cooper totaled five 
blocks. 

“We had the ball advantage, but 
we were giving up points that we 
shouldn’t have,” UCSD head coach 
Ricci Luyties said. “Hopefully we can 
build on this win streak and improve 
on it.” 

Prior to the match, UCSD 
introduced the Hall of Fame Class of 
2014 and unveiled the accompanying 
banners on the walls of RIMAC 
Arena. The seven members were 
officially inducted during a ceremony 
on Sunday morning. 

With the homestand sweep, 
UCSD improves to 10–5 overall and 
8–3 in California Collegiate Athletics 
Association rankings. The Tritons are 
in a four-way tie for second place, 
sharing the position with Cal State 
San Bernardino, Humboldt State and 
Cal State Los Angeles.

UCSD begins the second half 
of CCAA play on the road, visiting 
Chico State on Oct. 17 and traveling 
up to Northern California the 
following night to take on Cal State 
Stanislaus.

Tritons Face Tough Road Ahead to Qualify for Postseason

▶ W. SOCCER, from page 12

3–0 deficit and fell one player short 
for the remainder of the match via 
red card. 

The Warriors hit the back of the 
net in the 24th and 30th minutes 
to take an early 2–0 edge. In the 
38th minute, Cal State Stanislaus 
was awarded a penalty kick after 
sophomore midfielder Meghan Berry 
was issued an ejection for her foul 
as the last defender, preventing a 
clear scoring chance. The Warriors 
converted, forcing the Tritons to 
climb out of a daunting 3-goal hole 
while down a player. 

“Quite honestly, we committed 
suicide,” McManus said. “Two bad 
passes and suddenly, they’re two-
nothing up. And then the red card 
— the referee swears she was the last 
man, I don’t know if she [was] — but 
[they] just gave it, and we ended up 
three-nothing down.” 

UCSD appeared to shrug off 
its first-half woes, orchestrating a 
legitimate comeback attempt in the 
second period. Senior midfielder 
Kylie Hill struck first in the 58th 
minute before freshman midfielder 

tallied her team-best fourth goal of 
the season to put the match at 3–2. 

Stanislaus ultimately put away 
with the potential upset, scoring the 
fourth and final goal at the 80 minute 
mark. However, Coach McManus 
still found positives in the Tritons’ 
doggedness. 

“[The players] were upset,” 
McManus said. “And they got up 
for it. I thought they were up for the 
whole game. The tempo didn’t drop. 
They kept working.” 

After Friday’s bitter defeat, 
UCSD responded fiercely on Sunday 
afternoon against league opponent 
Cal State East Bay. While the Pioneers 
struck first with a goal at the 10 
minute mark, the Tritons responded 
with five unanswered goals to take 
the match 5–1. 

“[Friday’s game] definitely 
dampened our spirits,” Hill said. “It 
put us sub-500 for our record, and we 
just know from now on every game 
that we play is a playoff game. So we 
can’t lose. I think today we came out 
with a better attitude.” 

Hill and sophomore forward 

Kiera Bocchino finished with both 
a goal and an assist, while the three 
other goals came from senior forward 
Izzy Pozurama, sophomore defender 
Kristen Sampietro and freshman 
forward Katie O’Laughlin. 

The victory was much needed 
as UCSD struggles to remain in 
postseason contention. With the 
weekend split, the Tritons are now 
sixth in league standings. 

“[This win] boosts us,” Hill said. 
“Hopefully, this carries us into the 
next game and brings our energy 
up to carry [us] through because 
we just need wins from here on out. 
The season’s on the line, so any time 
there’s a slip up, it could be the end 
for us.”

The Tritons will now head back on 
the road, facing Cal State Monterey 
Bay, who sits one spot above UCSD 
in conference standings, on Friday, 
Oct. 17 before heading to the Bay 
Area to face another league foe at San 
Francisco State on Sunday.

their music, and was captivated to the point of 
traveling throughout Europe, playing and singing on 
street corners across the continent. Winner of the 
Montreux Jazz Festival's International Vocal 
Competition, the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz

on multiple scholarly and activist projects. Aside 
from sharing a life commitment to the struggle of 
peace with justice in Palestine and Israel, these two 
prominent feminist scholars have made 
contributions to other struggles for social, gender 
and sexual justice in the academy as well as at other 
international and North American sites.  This public 
talk grew out of the urgency of providing critical 
analyses on the massive eight week Israeli war on 
Gaza in July and August 2014 and the humanitarian 
crisis that resulted from the assault.

The Second Class
The 2014 collection inducted into the UCSD Athletics Hall of Fame consisted of seven former 

student-athletes whose collegiate careers changed the face of Triton sports history. 

2014

This past Saturday, Oct. 11, seven Triton alumni were officially inducted into the 
UCSD Athletics Hall of Fame. The 2014 class is only the second group to enter the 
prestigious ranks of Triton history as the tradition was established just one year ago. 

This year’s distinguished collection of former Triton student-athletes includes Julia 
Cuder (women’s soccer, 1999–2001), Jamie Dailey (women’s water polo, 1988–92), Carol 

Lipson (women’s volleyball, 1984–87), Bob Natal (baseball, 1984–87), Shannon Quigley 
(track & field/women’s volleyball, 1988–91), Chris Romey (men’s soccer, 1988–91, 93) 
and Paul Trainer (men’s basketball, 1971–75). 

Take a look at the impressive records and achievements each of the spectacular seven 
compiled throughout their historic careers as Triton superstars.

- Two-time National Soccer

America All-West Region First 
Team (2000, 2001)

“During my time here, we didn’t have a superstar that 
carried us through. We had a group of talented individuals 
that were dedicated, and [the coaching staff] just molded 
that talent and led us to three national championships.”

CHRIS ROMEYMEN’S SOCCER

- Two-time NCAA Division-III 
Championships (1991, 1993)

- First First-Team NSCAA All-
American in program history 
(1993)

- UCSD Athlete of the Year 
(1993–94)

“We’re a bunch of misfits. It’s ‘Bad News Bears’ times 
10. But somehow [Coach] was able to mold us into a 
team that did incredible things. It was an incredible 
time to be here.”

CAROL LIPSONWOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL

- Three NCAA Division-III 
National Championships

- NCAA Division-III Player of the 
Year (1987)

- UCSD No. 1 career service 
aces (247)

“I think a lot of our national championship teams, we were 
so different. I would even say a lot of those people weren’t 
necessarily my friends, but we were connected on a much 
deeper level ... Even when things were incredibly hard and felt 
like we had no chance … we achieved great things together.”

BOB NATAL MEN’S BASEBALL

- Drafted 13th round (No. 329 
overall) by Montreal Expos 
(1987), appeared in 120 career 
games, World Series Champion 
with Florida Marlins (1997)

- All-American First Team (1987)
- UCSD No. 1 career runs batted 

in (208), No. 2 career home 
runs (53)

“The one thing UCSD has always done is focus on 
the team concept. It’s a lot harder nowadays; seeing it 
professionally, it’s really difficult to understand how to 
bring that together. But being able to experience it, it really 
shaped me to basically what I am today.”

Division-III Volleyball National 
Championship (1989)

- Seven time All-American

No. 2 shot put (47’10”)

“[Shannon] really did fit in that role of big sister for 
everybody. So when I came on the track team, I saw that. 
She had always been my big sister, but seeing her being big 
sister to everybody on the team was a special and amazing 
thing.” - Cain Quigley

PAUL TRAINERMEN’S BASKETBALL 

- Three NCAA Division-III 
National Championships

- NCAA Division-III Player of the 
Year (1987)

“I want to thank the athletic department, who actually 
gave me a chance to come back and visit the campus and 
see all the unbelievable changes that have occurred here, 
like the new stadium and new track and field.”

JAMIE DAILEYWOMEN’S WATER POLO

- NCAA National Championship 
Three-Peat (1990–92)

- Two-time All-American
- USA Collegiate Championship 

Tournament MVP (1992)

“We were really fortunate to be in a place with sort of a 
pioneering athletic director Judy Sweet, who was very 
supportive of women’s volleyball and water polo and 
women’s sports and made it all happen. She backed us, 
coached us, taught us from the get-go. ”

The UCSD women’s volleyball 
team emerged victorious in its two-
game homestand this past weekend, 
sweeping league opponent Cal State 
Monterey Bay 3–0 on Friday in 
the second annual Reis Cup, held 
in honor of former standout Triton 
Karen Reis, who passed away in 2012. 
In another dominant performance on 
Saturday, the Tritons swept Cal State 
East Bay 3–0 as well. 

Despite the lopsided final score, 
the Reis Cup was a highly contested 
affair, with the night resulting in close 
scores of 25–21, 25–20 and 25–23.

Outside hitter junior Danielle 
Dahle was named MVP of the Reis 
Cup for the second straight year. 
Dahle finished the match with a 
co-high 12 points, 11 kills, a team-
best 15 digs, a service ace and two 
assists. Dahle finished attacking 
0.323, with one error in 31 attempts 
and tallied her fifth double-double of 
the season. 

Despite Dahle’s impressive night, 

the victory was far from an individual 
effort. Dahle was assisted by senior 
opposite Caitlin Brenton, who 
recorded 11 kills and seven digs, while 
freshman outside hitter Amanda 
Colla rose to the occasion with 10 
kills and nine scoops. Junior Kameron 
Cooper put out an impressive 0.400 
score with eight kills and only two 
errors in 15 swings. Junior Heidi 
Sierks posted an impressive team-
leading 10th double-double with 39 
assists and 10 digs. As a team, the

Entering homecoming weekend 
as the underdogs, the UCSD women’s 
soccer team fell 4–2 to No. 7 Cal 
State Stanislaus on Friday in spite of 
a noble comeback attempt, before 
tallying a resounding 5–1 win over 
Cal State East Bay on Sunday. The 
Tritons are now 5–5–2 overall and 
2–3–1 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

On Friday afternoon, the Tritons 

came out strong, winning the 
majority of the battles against one of 
the top teams in the nation. 

“The first 20 minutes, we 
dominated,” UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus told the UCSD 
Guardian. “We had corners, we had 
free kicks [and] we were scrambling 
across their goal. We just couldn’t put 
one away.”
