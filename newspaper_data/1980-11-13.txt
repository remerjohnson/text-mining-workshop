AS approves new 
student facility 

BY DEAN HAAS 
Staff W riler 

A new multi-purpose facil-
ity for student-sponsored 
events was approved "in 
concept" by the AS Council 
last night, 13 to two with 
three abstentions . The 
Council's action gives the 
Student Center Board the 
support it needs to begin 
development of specific plans 
for the facility, 

The proposed building 
would be used for dances, 
parties and meetings 
involving large groups of 
students. Most importantly, 
students would have first 
priority over its use. 

Not all Council members 
are convinced that a facility 
of this type is needed on 
campus. 

Debbe Kelley, AS Commis-
sioner of Appointments and 
Evaluations, called the 
facility a "huge expense" and 
suggested that money for 
such a building be used to 
find ways of obtaining a 
higher priority for student-
sponsored events in existing 
University structures. 

AS Commissioner of 
Pro~ramming, Joshua 
HarriS, who submitted the

resolution calling for AS 
approval of the facility, told 
the Council, "From my 
experience there is now no 
place on campus to hold 
student parties or dances." 

The AS and student 
organizations recently lost 
the privilege of holding 
dances and parties at one 
location, the International 
Center, because of damages 
done to that structure at the 
AS and Ski Club-sponsored 
Halloween party . The 
International Center is not 
University-run but control-
led instead by a group of 
community members. 

Preliminary estimates for 
the construction of such a 
facility hover around $3.25 
million, but SCB member 
Rich Mills emphasized to the 
Council that "the facility can 
be bu lt without raising 
student fees." 

A loan to be solicited from 
the UC Board of Regents 
would finance the con-
struction of the facility, said 
Mills. 

Mills said that the 
Council's conceptual appro-
val of the building will allow 
him to develop a "concrete, 
specific proposal" to present 
to the Council and the SCB. 
He hopes to have preliminary 
plans drawn up for the new 
center by June. 

In other business last 
night, the Council:

Students angered by the 
recent approval of cuts in 
campus bus service may 
soon have something else to 
complain about - the 
popular Coast Cruiser 
service to North County 
may be terminated this 

year. 
"We've been looking into 

the possibility of cutting it 
because North County 
Transit is now serving 
campus better than ever 
before," said Gloria Spencer 
of the Off-Campus Housing 
Office, which coordinates 
the Coast Cruiser Service.

Although NCT has 
extended line 301 south-
ward to UCSD this year, a 
strike now underway at the 
company has left service 
sporadic and unreliable. 
And according to union 
officials, no settlement to 
that strike is in sight. 

"The purpose of its (the 
Coast Cruiser) creation last 
year was to supplement San 
Diego Transit route ,which 
did not then serve North 
County," Spencer said. 
"Now that line 301 comes

A note to the left: you're going to be sorry 
Editor: 

The fact (nightmare) that 
Ronnie wilt be our next 
president is of course 
disturbing, but more 
frightening are the forces 
which contributed to his 
election. A whole new crop of 
slimy extremists - or should 
I say the same old crop, with a 
few more years' worth of 
festering - has surfaced in 
the scum·pit we call politics. 
One of the scarier aspects> of 
the far·right and the 'moral 
majority' (read: church of the 
ultra·right wing·tip) is their 
simplistically narrow view of 
who should run the country 
and why. 

Unfortunately, these goons 
were successful in running 
four of our most competent 
senators out of office with 
deliberately distorted smear 
campaigns aimed at the 
ignorant and ~llib\e, with 
funds from various 'activist' 
groups. (Campaign spending 
laws do not apply to 
campaigns against a 
candidate.) When a man who 
is anti·abortion is accused of 
being a "baby· killer" or 
"murderer." his morality is 
not being challenged; instead, 
he is being personally 
attacked in a nationwide 

witch hunt. It is interesting 
that other anti· left ads 
accused these same senators 
of not feeding the US war 
machine (or death machine?) 
fast enough. 

These defeats are only the 
most visible part of an ultra· 
regressive trend based on the 
theory that today's problems 
can be solved with policies of 
the past, despite the fact that 
these policies were often the 
cause of the problem. For 

instance, it's depressing to 
speculate how much better 
off we would be had we not 
blindly guzzled energy in the 
"good old days" to the point 
where we now use one·third 
of all the energy produced on 
earth. 

And who knows what good 
ole Americanism will do to 
the world in this era of 
increasing nuclear prolifera· 
tion. Therefore , these 

One more for the bus 
Editor: 

I could not believe my eyes 
when I read your article on 
the proposed change in bus 
service (The Daily Guardion, 
Nov. 7). After years of 
stru~le to get decent bus 
service coming through the 
campus, apparently the noise 
pollution that bothers the 
chancellor's complex is going 
to result in reducing 
convenience, accessibility 
and safety for hundreds of 
bus users. 

As a female student who 
has used the 30,34 and 41 bus 
routes over the past seven 
years, I really appreciated the 
change in bus routes 
approximately five years ago 

which brought the buses 
through the campus. It 
meant that I did not have to 
walk over to the VA Hospital 
in the dark to catch the bus 
home. I think safety is a 
factor and cutting down on 
campus bus service will 
encourage many students to 
drive to school or cut short 
their hours utilizing on· 
campus services at night 
such as the libraries. 

As an alternative, why not 
ban vehicular traffic through 
the campus and turn parking 
lots near the chance1lor's 
complex into green space to 
cut down on noise? ' 
MAURY BANDURRAGA 

simplistic creeps not only 
violate the principle of 
separation of church and 
state, but are also determined 
to stifle any semblance of 
social evolution which the 
technical and population 
explosions necessitate. 

Therefore. a1l persons with 
common sense and/or hopes 
of living into the 21st century 
should join the fight to 
reverse this "our country, 
right or right" demention. 

NAME WITHHELD 
UPON REQUEST 

You missed the point 
Editor: 

I must criticize your article 
concerning Germaine Greer's 
lecture. "The History of 
Women in Art" (The Daily 
Guardian, Nov. 7). Being full 
of inaccurate, out·of·context 
quotes, the article misinter· 
preted the essence of Greer's 
lecture. 

To quote Greer as saying. 
"Above all, art must be 
discontinued from its 
surroundings" without 
mentioning her sarcastic 
tone deceives the reader of 
her main point. Greer's main 
intent was to su~est that art 
shou Id be re·defmed as being 
a dynamic component of life, 
not intended to be etemalIy 
sheltered in museum s. 
Because art is a part of life, it 
should, like every living 
thing. be permitted to decay. 

Secondiy. Greer said that 
art does not necessarily have 
to be a product of traumatic, 
painful isolation. and that 
women who accept this 
stifling, enforced lifestyle are 
condemning themselves to 
the sterile, cy bernitic world 
dominated by men. She made 
it clear that women have the 
gift of feminine expression 

th~t .. incorporates daily 
actIVItIes, such as gardening 
or preparing a salad into a 
vibrant. living art. 

Unfortunately, until there 
is a social revolution, women 
must live within the 
constraints forced upon any 
oppressed class, and the 
effect of these constraints 
has made women in art 
miserably self-co nsciou s 
about what they are doing.

across the country have been 
turned out of office in the 
largest swing to the far right 
in American politics in most 
of our-lifetimes.

liberal and radical left. While 
the extreme right raised 
millions of dollars and waged 
one of the most earnest, well · 
organized and widespread 
campaigns against progres-
sive candidates ever, liberals 
couldn't decide whether to 
support Carter, Anderson, 
Commoner or even Reagan , 

.,..) 

or whether to keep them· 
selves completely unble· 
mished and opt out of the 
election process alt~ether. 
Consequently, they failed to 
work. in any effective way for 
the only candidate who had a 
real chance to defeat Reagan. 

Edward Kennedy's half· 
hearted support of Carter is 
one example. Eugene 
McC arthy s shameful 
support of Reagan is another, 
Shirley Chisholm's f1irta· 
tious meetin~ with Reagan 
staffers is still another. And 
then there is Ralph 
Abernathy. All of these 
people. people of whom we 
should be able to expect 
responsible political beha· 
viour, helped contribute to 
the victory of the right. 

On the local level, and as an 
example of the thought and 
behavior of the more radical 
left, we have only to look to

The simple fact is that 
these people, and this way of 
thinking , h e lped make 
Ronald Reagan the 40th 
President of the United 
States - even though these 
people know who Ronald 
Reagan is and what he stands 
for, and, for the most part, 
even though they oppose 
what he stands for. They 
know that he claimed that 
the problem of air pollution 
was substantially overcome 
during the same week that 
Los Angeles suffered several 
smog alerts and admissions

acquainted with his past 
proposals to blockade Cuba, 
and his promise to engage in 
an arms race in quest of 
military super iority. And 
they have had all too many 
instances of his pandering to 
far right groups like the 
Moral Majority. It is certain, 
too. that they know that he 
opposes a constitutional 
amendment that would 
guarantee equal rights under 
the law for women. Still, they 
refused to support and work 
for Carter. even though he 
was the only chance they had 
to prevent a Reagan 
presidency. 

To those who actually 
voted for Reagan , I have 
nothing to say. But to those 
who helped to contribu e to 
his election by refusing to 
back Carter, I would like to 
ay a few thing . One 

argument that was given for 

not backing President Carter 
was that there were other 
candidates more "worthy." 
Even though these candi· 
dates did not have a chance to 
win, it was important to vote 
for them because: You should 
vote for the candidate you 
really think is best, or 
because it regis ters a 
"protest" against current 
policies which all the major 
candidates favor, or, finally, 
because it helps bring to 
public attention issues which 
the major candidates refuse 
to examine . Another 
argument given for not 
backing Carter was that 
voting was a "trap for fools," 
and Just not a meaningful 
political action. 

There is something 
fundamentally wrong with 
all these arguments. First, 
they all ignore political 
reality and misunderstand 
the purpose of casting a vote, 
The polling booth is not a 
place to express one's private 
conscience or one's utopian 
dreams. It is not a place to 
register a protest against the 
system as a whole. And it is 
not a place which can 
magically bring issues to 
light which were in the dark 
before. MO!it importantly, it 
is not a place to engage in 
ineffectual political mastur· 
bation, or a place to keep 
one's hands clean of all the 
"dirtiness" of real political 
life. 

More deeply. however, 
what is common to all the 
various ways of justifying a 
refusal to help elect Carter 
and defeat Reagan, is a 
refusal to distinguish 
between lesser and greater 
evils, and a strange 
unwillingness to recognize 
the fact that the lives of some 
people will actually be 
different because of Reagan's 
elect ion. These two last 
points are clearly linked.

PSA strike: planes 
in air by Sunday? 

SAN DIEGO - A 
ten.tative end to the pilot's 
strike that has idled Pacific 
Southwest Airlines for 49 
days ~as reached yesterday. 
negotiators for both sides 
announced. 

If the agreement is 
approved by. the 450 striking 
pilots and flight engineers, a 
PSA spokesman said "we 
could be back in the air on a 
limited basis" Sunday. 

No details were made 
public, but he said the 
company's last rejected pay 
offer was accepted. 

"I think it's an equitable 
contract," said Bryan Conn , 
president of the striking 
Southwest Flight Crew 
Association. 

The San Diego· based 
airline, 13th l~rgest in the 
nation. "did give us some 
improvements which we 
sought in other areas." Conn 
said, adding "I think they 
(union members) will ratify 
it. " 

The union immediately 
called its officers together to 
consider a back·to·work 
agreement required with a 
new contract. 

Such an agreement was 
described by federal mediator 
Robert Harris as a " major 
hitch." He said PSA "is still 

insisting on a work rule 
agreement that all be back to 
work by 5 pm Friday," 

But pilots' negotiator Joe 
McLaughlin said after two 
hours of negotiations, which 
resumed at the pilots' 
request: "It looks like r,lanes 
will fly again Sunday. ' 

A marathon, 13-hour 
session was broken off late 
Tuesday night without an 
agreement. 

"We need to work out the 
detailed language of the 
agreement now." Conn said. 
"If the membership ap· 
proves, we could be back in 
the air on a limited basis 
Sunday," 

In newspapers in five US 
metropolitan areas PSA 
advertised Tuesday or 
Wednesday for replacement 
pilots and said hundreds 
were applying. 

The airline said the first 
330 of the striking pilots 
would be given retroactive 
pay under the new contract 
replacing one which expired 
last Jan. 1. By yesterday, 18 
including several veteran 
pilots had crossed their 
union's picket lines to report 
back to work. 

The strike has shut down

of a tax cut backed by 
President-elect Ronald

Senate Democrats voted

floor - a measure House 
Speaker Thomas p, O'Neill

In 32 years - would be brief 
with a shortened agenda. . 

Although congress ional 
Republicans were still 
pressing for enactment of a 
tax cut this year, the proposal 
was virtually buried - at 
least until 1981 - when 
Senate Democrats voted in a 
c1osed·door caucus against 
bringing it to the Senate 
floor. 

At the same time. O'Neill

1981 cars 
fuel efficient 

SACRAMENTO - The 
state Air Resources Board 
said yesterday that some 
1981 model cars are meeting 
fuel economy standards three 
years ahead of schedule, 
according to test results. 

Board chairwoman Mary 
Nichols said the new cars are 
also meeting some of 
California's strict emission 
standards two years before 
they are r~uired to. 

"Two thirds of the 1981 
models available in Califor-
nia now provide the same or 
better gas mileage than 
similar models sold in the 
rest of the country, averaging 
27 miles per gallon in 
combined city and highway 
driving." she said. 

She said the total fuel 
milt!3ge performance for 198] 
will equal the federal 
government's fuel economy 
standard for 1984 models.

Left is going to be sorry 
continued from page 2 
evil'; if one must vote for evil, 
whet her lesser or greater, the 
franchise is meaningless," I 
cannot believe that they 
actually mean what they say. 
When one has lost the 
capacity or the willingness to 
distinguish between what 
causes less suffering and 
death and what causes 'more 
suffering and death, it is a 
serious and tragic matter. 
But when one calls the entire 
effort to make such 
distinctions "meaningless," 
then the situation is not only 
tragic, but one suspects that 
these deeply sincere haters of 
evil have somehow been 
overcome by evil themselves. 

The way Americans vote 
affects the lives of people 
everywhere on earth . Who 
would try to tell t he people of 
Nicaragua that it makes no 
difference whether Carter or 
Reagan is President of the 
United States? Carter's 
benign neglect of this country 
durin~ its recent revolution 
stood 10 stark contrast to the 
past several decades' policy of 
intervention on behalf of 
"friendly" right·wing 
dictators. And now what will 
become of Carter's plan to 
give millions of dollars ' of 
support to this stru~ling 
Nicaraguan nation whIch is 
just now in the middle of an 
ambitious program to wipe 
out illiteracy among its poor? 
Can you imagine Reagan 
carrying that project 
through? And whither now 
Guatemala? And how about 
Bolivia, with whom we have 
temporarily severed reltions, 
but with whose criminal anti-

democratic leaders Reagan 
has already promised to 
renew ties? 

But we need not go so far 
away to remember how to 
distinguish between "~eater 
and lesser evils." Dunng the 
first two· thirds of this 
century, when 11 percent of 
our population was black, 
over 90 percent of all 
executions for the crime of 
rape were of black men. 
Strom Thurmond is deter-
mined to see that more 
executions go on posthaste. 
Tell the poor or minority 
convicts on death row that 
there is only a negligible 
difference between Carter 
and Reagan. Or tell Senators 
McGovern, Church, Bayh 
and Culver, and the people 
who depend on them (not 
only Americans) the same 
thing. The Reagan victory 
contributed to their defeat as 
well. Lots of people are and 
have been all along more than · 
aware of the difference 
between a Carter victory and 
a Reagan victory. In the 
Linda Vista precinct I visited 
on election eve, a Spanish 
speaking woman came to the 
door in tears about the 
Reagan landslide; most of her 
minority neighbors felt the 
same way ... and they knew 
why. 

While some liberals were 
incapable of engaging in 
effective political action on 
the national, state or local 
levels, the extreme right slate 
won by a landslide, 
nationally, st atewide and 
locally - and part of the 
blame simply must be placed 
on those who refused to 

support President Carter. 
Politics is a non-violent way 
of resolving conflict. In order 
for politics to be possible, 
people must be committed to 
participating earnestly and 
energetically, and they must 
be willing to comprQmise. 
Most left-liberals lacked such 
commitment this election 
year, and the consequences 
have been disastrous. The 
moderates stayed with 
Carter, but they were just 
out-maneuvered and finally 
outnumbered. 

What irresistably comes to 
mind is the situation of the 
Weimar Republic in pre-nazi 
Germany. Germany was in a 
difficult period. There was 
high inflation and there were 
a number of difficult, 
perplexing issues wich did 
not admit of simple solutions. 
There was a great deal of 
popular frustration and a 
very large amount of 
dissatisfaction with the 
social democratic regime. 
The social democrats were 
perceived as weak, vacilla-
ting and incompetent, and 
many of the German people 
longed for the position of 
power and respect they had 
enjoyed prior to their 
humiliation in World War I 
and in the signing of the 
Versai lies Treaty. The 
discontent with the liberal, 
democratic, moderate and 
slow-moving Social Demo-
cratic Party was not limited 
to the right and to the Nazis. 
The left, too, withdrew its 
support in politics in an 
effectual way altogether. 
They even boasted about not

Fate of Cruiser 
rests of funding 

continued from pagP. 1 
you practically to where you 
live, which is especially nice 
in the rain," he added, saying 
that the service is "cheaper, 
faster and more reliable" 
than North Countv Transit. 

Funding for the Coast 
Cruiser comes primarily 
from UCSD's Parking and 
Transportation Office, 
which each year transfers 
$4,000 to the Off·Campus 
Housing Office. However, 
most of that amount is 
returned by the end of the 
year, generated from the fare. 

Claudia Wilde of the 
Parking Office said yesterday 
she has "been given the go-
ahead to transfer the $4,000 
this month. It's my 
assumption that if the money 
is being transferred, the 
service will be retained." 

Parking Office Manager 
Bob Umstead, who has the 
final say on funding of the 
Cruiser, was unavailable for 
comment yesterday. 

Spencer said she hopes the 
Coast Cruiser will not be cut, 
citing the 20 to 30 students 
who depend on that form of 

featuring: 

transportation nightly as 
evidence that the servIce is 
needed 

"The Coast Cruiser also 
provides employment for 
students," said Spencer. "We 
hire students to drive the 
vans. At one time nine of our 
drivers were students." 

The possibility of running 
the Coast Cruiser on a later 
schedule, beginning after the 
last North County Transit 
bus leaves UCSD at 9:45 pm, 
has also been raised. 

The Coast Cruiser 
currently leaves campus for 
northward runs at 8:30, 9:30 
and 10:30 pm Sunday 
through Thursday. It can be 
caught at Central Library , 
the Bookstore, Urey Hall , the 
Applied Physics and 
Mathematics building on 
Muir campus and at Third 
College. 

Traveling north on 
Highway WI, the van makes 
everal stops in Del Mar, 

Solana Beach, Encinitas and 
Leucadia , returning to 
campus along Highway 5.

Apathetic attitude of left wingers

having voted . Everyone 
knows the consequences of 
that abdication of political 
respons ibility . And how 
foolish, we all think, it was 
for them not to be able to 
distinguish between greater 
and lesser evils. 

The analogy is a limited 
one, and there are many deep 
and important differences 
between Weimar Germany 
and the US in the 19805. 
Ronald Reagan is nothing like 

Hitler. And I don 't want to 
argue, either, that the 
German left shared any 
moral res ponsibility for 
Germany's actions during 
the Nazi years. I am aying 
that when there was still a 
possibility of preventing the 
far right from taking over 
that country, a dim 
possibility, maybe, and one 
which would require a great 
deal of cooperative work to 
bring to reality, they 
neglected to recognize it, or 

they were not willing to work 
to realize it. The consequen-
ces were real, and made a 
great deal of difference. 

Here, today, while those of 
the liberal-left persuasion 
who refused to work for the 
only real chance of defeating 
Reagan continue to keep 

th~mselves free of comp,ro-
mIse and the "dirtiness' of

Water polo team loses a 
close one to UC Riverside 

UCSD goes north for tough weekend 
BY JIM AGRONICK 

The men's waterpolo team ended their Friday also seemed tu be a day for goalies as 
home season Friday with a disappointing 8-7 Triton goal-tender Willie Morrison electrified 
loss to UC Riverside. A standing-room-only the crowd with some phenomenal saves. 
crowd cheered for the Tritons in one of the Morrison proved just how handy a 14-foot 
most enthusiastic displays of support in arm span can be as he blocked a four meter 
sever.al years. penalty shot in the third quarter. 

The action created tense moods in both the 
pool and crowd, especially when both teams 
entered the final quarter tied at seven. The 
pressure hampered the Tritons as they 
repeatedly failed to score on several man-up 
situations. 

Dan Eby, a senior on the team, said "We 
beat ourselves. We tried to force a play 
instead of looking at what was open. We 
definitely out-played Riverside. We just 
couldn't score.' 

Despite the team's fourth quarter 
problems, the game did not lack exceptional 
plays. Senior Toby Raymond sparked the 
Triton offense early with a strong outside 
shot in the first quarter. Ken South followed 
with a similar shot drilled past the Riverside 
goalie. 

Several other Tritons also managed to 
score in the competitive game. Rounding out 
the UCSD offense were Steve Marx and Jeff 
Elliot, each with two goals, and Dan E by with 
a quick inside water shot in the third quarter. 

Erratum 
In last Monda>:'s story about a soaring 

excursion, a saIl plane was incorrectly 
identified as a Schwitzer model 126. The 
glider was actually a 222, also made by the 
Schwitzer company. 

Tlte Daily Guardian regrets the error. 

The home team led the entire game until 
t he last five seconds of the third quarter when 
Riverside evened the score. A qUIck Riverside 
goal in the last quarter put them ahead byone 
point. Although UCSD had three man-up 
situations in the las t quarter, they failed to 
capitalize on them and the score remained at 
an 8-7 loss for the Tritons. 

Triton coach Denn y Harper was 
disheartened by the team's performance, but 
looks forward to anot her shot at Riverside in 
the California Collegiate Athletic Association 
playoffs. "I told the team before the game that 
the only thing standing in our way was 
ourselves. We played on the same level as the 
Riverside team, but we just didn't look for 
good shooting lanes," he said. 

Weak offensive skills hampered the 
Tritons in their match with Riverside, but 
Harper thinks he has a remedy for this. It' s 
called "Pract ice-Basic-Skills-by-Playing-
Three-of-the-Nation's-Top-Water-Polo-
Teams-the-Weekend-Before-League-Play-
offs." Harper purposely scheduled matches 
with the powerful teams from Pepperdine, 
UCLA and Cal State Fullerton for this 
weekend to toughen the Tritons before 

'conference playoffs. 
According to Harper, "We won't run into 

any playoff team that will be as tough as the 
ones we're playing this weekend. The CCAA 

~ames will be very competitive but we should 
:Je ready."

by Klft KrlJllJ" 
Despite spectacular saves by t he Triton goalie, UCSD 

lost a tough 8 -7 match to UC Riverside on Friday. This 
weekend the team faces top competition in preparation 
for district finals_ 

Track meeting tonight 
The track and field team will hold their first meeting 

tonight, in AP&M 2313 at 7 pm. Athletes of all calibers are 
encouraged to attend, as no competitive experience is 
necessary to make the team. Andy Skief, team coach , can be 
reached at x4032 for more information. 

Based on past seasons, Skief says that "the team will be 
weak in the field events and the sprints. We usually have a 
good foundation for the middle distances because of the 
athletes that run cross,country, but traditionally we lack 
needed depth in the weight events and short distances."

EABLO CASALS 
TRIO 

Ncw.nlbcr 16, Sunct.y 
The Pablo Casals Trio was founded by the 
great cellist when he called the three 
musicians to his home in Puerto Rico in 
1973. In a relatively short period of time, 
the Casals has become a trio worthy of 
their maestro's blessing. When they were 
in La Jolla last year, critics hailed their 

performance as a "triumph."

Ives: Trio for Vio lin, Cello & Piano
