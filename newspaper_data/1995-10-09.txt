Spot Black Hoi. 
BERKELEY - Cal astrono-
mers have identified the 
second known black hole in 
the Milky Way galaxy, the 
university announced Thurs-
day. According to researchers, 
the object located 14,400 light 
years fropt ~arth, in the 
constellation Vulpecula, is a 
black hole. Black holes consist 
of highly compressed matter, 
with gravitational fields 
intense enough to draw in 
nearby particles - such as 
light - and compact them 
into almost nothing. The 
object was first thought to be a 
black hole in 1988, but it was 
not until 1993 that researchers 
had the technology to confirm 
their theory.

Brown Students In 
Barroom Brawl 
PROVIDENCE, RI - At least 
four Brown University 
students were hospitalized two 
weeks ago, following a brawl 
at Spats - a local bar - that 
involved members of the 
Brown football team and other 
Brown students. According to 
police, the incident occurred 
around 11:30 p.m. on Satur-
day, Sept. 23, when football 
players attacked a group of 
students sitting at the back of 
the bar. Among those injured 
was a cheerleader, Tara 
Sanchez, who suffered a 
broken nose, and another 
student, who was seriously 
hurt when a bar stool was 
smashed over his head.

General 
Store Co-op 
Suffers 
$5,400 Theft 
BUNDLE: Cash and checks 
taken from store last Monday 
or Tuesday 
By Anand Patel 
Guardian Reporter 

On Tuesday, Sept. 26, the General Store Co-
op discovered that over $5,400 in cash and 
checks had been stolen during the previous 24 
hours. 

Although the exact time of the theft is un-
known, co-op members placed the time of the 
burglary between 4:40 p.m. on Monday and 
5:00 p.m. on Tuesday. . 

While senior co-op members refused to go 
on record regarding the incident, they did say 
that they are unsure of exactly how the crime 
was committed. 

One member, who wished to remain anony-
mous, said there was no sign of forced entry, but 
that the theft could have occurred during the 
General Store's normal business hours. 

According to co-op officials, every evening 
the cash and checks taken from each register are 
counted, the amount is recorded and the money 
is bundled - with a deposit slip prepared for 
each bundle. 

These bundles are then placed into a single 
deposit bag, which is kept in the store 's safe 
before being taken to the bank later in the 
evening. 

On Monday, however, for reasons unex-
plained, the deposit bag was not taken to the 
bank, allowing one of the money bundles to be 
stolen. 

General Store officials said that the two co-
op members who filled out deposit slips for the 
bundles were unsure as to whether the bag was 
put back into the safe after the deposit slips were 
prepared.

Cosmic Music Carnival Draws 500 to Price Center 
MUSIC: Blues-based rock, rap 
and rock-and-roll converge in 
A.S.-sponsored concert. 
By M.ryHIUI" 

Gu~rd;an Reporter 
More than 500 students congregated in the 

Price Center Friday night for the A.S.-spon-
sored - . and UCSD's first - Cosmic Music 
Carnival. 

The three-hour concert featured rock-and-
roll legend Otis Day and the Knights, female rap 
group Da Five Footer Crew and Munkafust, a 
three-man, blues-based rock band from UCSB. 

Aside from the wide selection of music, 
there was also an inflatable giant slide, obstacle 
course and inverted bungee jump erected in and 
around the Price Center plaza. 

"Our idea was to cater to a wide array of 
different musical tastes," A.S. Assistant Pro-
grammer Jeff Krauss said. "And I think we did 
just that." 

Munkafust opened the show, as a small 
number of students drifted in and out of the 
plaza. DJs Q-Bert, Smallwonder and Krazy 
Kut entertained the audience between sets, 
although the audience was only four rows 
deep against the front of the stage as Da Five 
Footer Crew began itsperformance. 

Marshall senior Karla English attributed the 
poor initial attendance to weak publicity, as 
well as miscommunication over the kind of 
music that would be featured. 

"I was on my way to eat, or I wouldn 't have 
come," English said. "I saw the posters and I 
thought [the music] was going to be alterna-
tive." 

Krauss said that more extensive promotion 
will be the key to future events. 

"We need to find a way to reach out to all the 
students, so we can make the TGs like the days 
of old, wben there were a few thousand people 
there," he said. "When you have a few thousand 
people at an event like this, it's pretty hard not

ERRATUM 
In the Oct. 5 issue of the Guardian, Graduate Student 

Association (GSA) President Steve Dubb was incorrectly quoted 
regarding the GSA's stance on the $5,000 annual audit required 
of the eM Caft. The quote was attributed to Dubb, but it was 
actually stated by a core member of the Food Co-ops. Dubb 
maintains that the GSA feels an annual audit of the Che Cafe is 
unnecessary for an establishment of its size. An annual review 
- not an audit - is what the GSA recommends. The Guardian 
regrets the error. 

In conjunction with National Breast cancer Aware-
ness Month, the UCSD Cancer Center Thrivers ' Net-
work is sponsorine the "Knowled&e is Power: Taking

Topics of the event will include mammography, 
breast self-examination, risk factors and possibilities 
for prevention, pros and cons of hormone-replacement 
therapy, advanced techniques in breast surgery and 
new therapies, such as ste~1I transplantation and 
breast-<:ancer vaccines. 

The symposium will be followed by a "Meet the 
Speakers" luncheon. Pre--reglstration for the event is 
$25, or $35 at the door. 

In addition, mammograms will be available through-
out the day, for a cost of $65 for women who pre-
register for the screening by Oct. 9.

FFOG Features

FEsnVAL: Students 
drawn to Sun God lawn 
for food and fun 
By MMthew Kalinowski 
Guardian Reporter 

Organizations from Ba 'hai to 
NORML(National Organization for 
the Reform of Marijuana Laws) 
kicked off the 12th-annual Fall Fes-
tival on the Green (FFOG) last Fri-
day on the Sun God lawn. 

Sponsored by the Associated Stu-
dents (A.S.), FFOG featured more 
student-organization booths than 
ever before. 

" It 's an informational and pro-
motional fair that enables [student 
organizations] to tell people all about 
themselves," said Student Affairs 
Advisor Marcia Strong, who orga-
nizes FFOG every year. 

dents Against Censorship on the 
Internet, one of the many organiza-
tions making its debut at this year's 
FFOG. 

" It was really worthwhile," said 
Revelle freshman Brian Truong, a 
representative from the Navigators, 
a Christian fellowship group. " It's a 
good chance for freshmen to get to 
know the clubs." 

The Navigators, one of the few 
organizations permitted to sell food 
at FFOG, attracted large crowds all 
day. 

"A lot of people seemed inter-
ested in the food and the fellow-
ship," Truong added. 

" We had great success recruiti ng 
a lot of new members," Strong said. 
She added that, by the end of the 
day, it was difficult to get the orga-
nizations to pack up and leave the 
Sun God lawn. 

The UCSD Guardian NEWS) 

Representatives from various re-
ligious groups, sports clubs, publi-
cations, fraternities and the A.S. all 
made appearances from t t a.m. to 4 
p.m. at FFOG. The festival also fea-
tured a short performance by the 
Triton dance team. 

However, others thought that 
more publicity for the event might 
have boosted the attendance. 

Skullduaery: Troy Eggleston, president of the UCSD Anthropology SOCiety, and his friends got more 
than a few second glances from passers-by at Friday's Fall Festival on the Green (FFOG). 

This year's all-time high of 140 
booths eclipsed last year 's total of 
115. 

"We got more response than we 
thought we would," said Mark 
Chaussee, a representative for Stu-

"A lot of people came just be-
cause they were passing through," 
said Roosevelt senior Emy Kang, 
also from the Navigators. 

Kang added that if the festival 
had been held later in the quarter, 
more students would have come. 

According to Strong, FFOG is 
held at the beginning offall quarter 
so that organizations can have their 

new members for most of the school 
year. 

" [FFOG] is a pretty good idea," 
said Muirfreshman Erick Miranda. 
"It can be hard to find out about 
extra-curricular activities. This 
way you don ' t have to be hunting 
all aroL!nd campus. It's all right 
there."

PINION 

to the 

Corruption and 
RaclslR Plagued ft. 
Prosacutlon 
By FrancIHo DeVri •• 
Special to the Guardian 

I feel quite certain that O.J. Simpson is guilty of a 
brutal double-murder and should spend the rest of his 
life rotting in jail. But without question, the jury did 
the right thing by setting Simpson free last Tuesday. 

Guilty or inrwcent, the O.J. Simpson 
trial guaranteed a closer look at race 

and the justice system in America 
Convicting Simpson would have exonerated the 

racism, incompetence and negligence surrounding the 
police investigation. The Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment (LAPD) played fast and loose with the public 
trust, the law and the Constitution. 

Put yourself in a jury seat. The prosecution put for-
ward a mountain of evidence - seemingly 
more than , enough to put 
Simpson away for life. 
But several members 
of the LAPD who col-
lected, documented and 
ultimately reported that . 
evidence were racist and 
incompetent. 

Perhaps the best ex-
ample of this was the 
search of Simpson 's 
house by Detectives 
Mark Fuhrman and 

See RACE, Page 5

ft. V.dlcI, but til. Jury IlBeU 
By D.W ¥811 Hoften 
Associate Opinion Editor 

The entire country had come to a stand-
still. And then it erupted. 

With the reading of the 0.1. Simpson 
verdict, American society forced itself to 
directly confront some of the most divisive 
and ultimately important issues of our time. 
Certainly, race had been at the forefront of 
the trial since the beginning. Practically 
everyone in the country could recite the 
latest polls, proudly pointing out how 75 
percent of blacks thought Simpson was in-
nocent, while 70 percent of whites thought 
he was guilty. ' 

Blacks cheered the verdict as if Simpson 
were a member of their own families, while 
whites shook their heads in disgust. How-
ever, we didn't need this trial to identify 
the massive racial chasm in America. We 
did need it, however, to identify another 
pressing problem with our country: the jus-
tice system. 

To some, the cry for judicial revision 
appears u an overreaction to this particu-
lar trial. The problems plaguing our justice 

system are not new - they existed long 
before Simpson wu charged with murder. 
The Simpson trial simply serves as a cata-
lyst for change - and an indication to the 
American public that the current system 
needs serious revision. 

The racially split reaction to the verdict 
proves, by itself, that most Americans are 
unhappy with the judicial process. Blacks 
celebrated the decision because they 
viewed it as an aberration from their no-
tion of common American justice. Most 
blacks contend that the justice system fa-
vors whites, and that black suffer unfairly, 
often presumed guilty until proven inno-
cent. Their emotional attachment to the 
Simpson case serves as testimony to this 
belief. 

Meanwhile, whites see the decision as 
representative of the faulty legal system. 
Many argue that Simpson was acquitted 
strictly due to race - his tuId the jury '5. 
~ also suggest that a white defendant 
would have been convicted with the same 
evidence.

Senior Staff Writer 

To people outside the U niled States, the 
O.J. Simpson trial probably looked like a 
new comedy from NBC. Forget "Friends" 
- foreigners from around the world tuned 
in to see bumbling police, a muskrat-l ike 
judge who cried on the stand, teams of law-
yers bickering amung themselves and a 
massive media throng. 

British folks switching channels be-
twcen the BBC and their favorite soccer 
match must have thought the "Trial of the 
Century" was a new soap opera, like 'As 
the World Turns." Frenchmen, no doubt 
sipping wine in some quaint cafe, must still 
be guffawing over the ever-important 
Fuhrman tapes. And the Spanish are cer-
tainly chuckling over the testimony of the 
various DNA "experts." 

Everyone - from Europe to Asia to 

Australia - must be laughing out loud at

RACE: Illegal

procedures exposed

Philip Vannaller. Despite having no 
search warrant, Fuhrman jumped 
the fence of Simpson's estate,let in 
the other detectives and proceeded 
to search the grounds. It was during 
this search that Fuhrman came 
across the infamous bloody glove. 

It violates our constitutional 
rights to search anything or any-
one without a warrant - the 
Fourth Amendment is clear about 
this. When placed in front of a 
judge and asked to explain this 
devious search, Fuhrman and 
Vannatter said they had gone to 
Simpson's house to inform the 
football hero of the terrible news 
of the murders, and because they 
had feared for his safety. 

As Scott Turow wrote in the 
New York Times, "If veteran po-
lice officers did not arrive at the 
gate of Mr. Simpson 's home think-
ing he might have committed these 
murders, then they should have 
been fired." The reality is that the 
detectives should have known that 
husbands or boyfriends are' re-
sponsible for half of all women 
murdered in the United States -
and Fuhrman had already investi-
gated Simpson once before for 
beating his ex-wife, Nicole. 

Even worse" Judge Lance Ito 
accepted the evidence as if it had 
been legally obtained. This kind of 
blatant disrespect for our rights is 
common, according to legal observ-
ers in Los Angeles. 

But it wasn't enough for 
Fuhrman to doom any chance of a 

conviction by tampering witb tbe 
evidence - he turned out to be a 
racist ass on top of it. If there were 
any doubt in the jury's mind that the 
prosecution had undermined itself 
by allowing such illegally obtained 
evidence into the trial, it was erased 
by the release of the Fuhrman tapes. 
His racist, epithet-slinging diatribe 
was sickening - and he had lied 
on the witness stand about ever say-
ing those things as well. And the 
prosecution wanted the jury to trust 
him? 

Even the jury knows that 
Fuhrman lied. It also knows that the 
LAPD botched the investigation 
from beginning to end: The police 
neglected to call the coroner for 11 
hours after finding the bodies on the 
rught of the murders; Vannatter car-
ried a sample of Simpson's blood 
around in his pants pocket; the 
prosecution's DNA "expert" did his 
math wrong; they couldn' t get the 
time right on the video camera while' 
taping evidence; and their crime lab 
was so contaminated, they might as 
well move into my kitchen. These 
were more than enough examples of 
police incompetency for any decent 
person to ask, "What the hell is go-
ing on here?" 

Judging from the polls, most 
white people sat around glumly af-
ter the verdict, swearing about the 
injustice of it all. What would have 
been truly unjust is if we had let 
these bozos get away with this de-
bacle. The police are supposed to 
play by the rules and uphold th'e 
law - not perjure themselves and 
conduct illegal searches. The en-
tire department's handling of evi-
dence borders on criminal negli-
gence.

These aren't little technicalities 
that set Simpson free - these are 
gross manipulations of the pub-
lic's trust and tbe law. Fuhrman 
bas done more than enough in this 
investigation to go to jail. No 
right-thinking jury could have 
conv icted. someone under these 
circumstances. 

But there is a greater point 
here. The incompetence of the en-
tire LAPD during the Simpson in-
vestigation showed the country 
how that police department works: 
its casual disregard for the truth, 
its shoddy investigation pr;u:tices 
and its arrogance when confronted 
with criticism - all this in a case 
where everyone knew the lawyers 
and media would be watching 
closely. I shudder to think of how 
a "regular" murder investigation 
is handled. 

The Fuhrman tapes and the 
conduct of the rest of Fuhrman's 
cronies in the LAPD make it abun-
dantly clear that justice is not even 
on the radar screen of their con-
cerns. The idiot detective bragged 
on tape that he and his colleagues 
regularly fabricate evidence and 
lie on the stand. Furthermore, 
Fuhrman said they prey on black 
people simply because they are 
black. 

Undoubtedly, innocent people 
are sitting in jail because the 
LAPD dces not seem to care very 
much whether a suspect is inno-
cent or guilty. For many on the 

OPINION S 

force, it is enough to know that 
this person is black and poor. This 
must stop. 

Four years ago, the police offic-
ers who beat Rodney King were set 
free by a Simi Valley jury, which 
had no understanding of the racism 
and hatred which motivated those 
cops. Many of us were outraged by 
the decision; but the residents of 
South Central Los Angeles seethed, 
and L.A. burned for three days and 
nights. 

When the Simpson verdict was 
read on Tuesday, those of us who 
don't live in South Central Los An-
geles got a small taste of the sick-
ening anger that injustice breeds. It 
is a lesson which we all should learn 
well. For many in our country, this 
feeling is a way of life. 

If the Simpson verdict helps 
put an end to these illegal police 
practices, then justice will have 
prevailed after all . What passes as 
routine in big-city police depart-
ments is not only unjust, but crimi-
nal as well. Our justice system 
presently works for those with 
money, leaving the rest virtually 
helpless against a system which 
does not care about innocence or 
guilt. 

Putting more cops on the streets 
is not the answer to our problems in 
the inner city - the solution is dif-
ficult and multi-faceted. But we can 
begin by putting an end to the cor-
rupt practices of the LAPD that al-
lowed Simpson to walk free.

6 OPINION 

JURY: Juror's 
black-power salute 
reveals bias 
Continued from ... e 4 

Apparently, the bulk of the 
American populace is dissatisfied 
with the current justice system. 

Still, the problems with the sys-
tem go far beyond simple racial di -
vision. While race may have split 
the viewing audience, several jurors 
maintained that race played no role 
in the verdict. Defense attorney 
Johnnie Cochran also denied play-
ing the "race card." But when juror 
No. 8 hailed Simpson with a black-
power salute, the racial impact was 
confirmed. And here is where the 
fundamental shortcoming of Ameri-
can justice stands out - surpris-
ingly, not in racial issues, but with 
the jury system itself. 

The jury system is flawed across 
the board. First, the notion of a 
defendant's peers deciding his guilt 
is unsettling. I certainly don't trust 
the average American's capacity for 
reason and logic enough to judge my 
innocence or guilt. After all, it was 
the average American jury that 
awarded a woman millions of dol-
lars for spilling scalding-hot 
McDonald's coffee on her lap. And 
it was the same type of jury that 
awarded an obese man compensa-
tion for being too fat to sit in a 
restaurant '5 booths. 

The average American has 
proven himself incapable of a task 
as significant as jury duty. Simpson 
juror Gin" Rosborough admitted 
that she "just didn't understand the 
part of the trial about DNA." Any 
system that requires people to ab-

sorb evidence which they cannot 
comprehend deserves a second 
look. I certainly don't profesa to 
understand DNA discussions, 
which, by the same reasoning, ren-
ders me unqualified to be on such a 
jury. 

Even worse, howCNer, is the pro-
cess of jury deliberation. Shoving 
12 strangers into a stuffy room af-
ter a long trial doesn't seem like the 
fairest way to achieve justice. The 
four-hour Simpson verdict proves 
where jurors' true interests lie: not 
in the careful and proper practice of 
Alllerican justice" but in gelling 
home as soon as possible. 

The problematic jury system is 
further highlighted by the frequency 
with which people try to avoid jury 
duty. Granted, in the Simpson case, 
nine months of being sequestered 
might have taken its toll, but this is 
just one more reason to revamp the 
system. People's lives depend on the 
jurorsj it would be a shame to let 
minor burdens decide a defendant's 
fate. 

But the deliberation process has 
even more failings. The need for a 
unanimous decision results in inef-
ficient and misguided sessions of 
persuasion. If one or two jurors be-
lieve a man is innocent, while the 
others believe he is guilty, the ma-
jority will gang up on the dissent-
ers, exerting every effort to strip the 
latter of their beliefs. This process 
leaves itself vulnerable to numerous 
difficulties. Basically, it's complete 
luck whether the personalities and 
characters of the jurors happen to 
be in accordance with each other. 

Granted, the selection process 
weeds out the crazies and those with 
personal agendas or overbearing

beliefs, but it does not and cannot 
choose 12 people with either com-
patible personalities or ones which 
won't negatively affect the delibera-
tion. 

Consider a case in which two ju-
rors maintain the defendant's inno-
cence: If those two happen to be in-
secure or easily persuaded people, 
they may be more apt to give in to 
the pressures of the other to. Con-
sider, on the other hand, t 1 wanting 
to convict and one lone juror want-
ing to acquit. That single juror might 
be overly stubborn or have a spe-
cific agenda, refusing to so much as 

, listen to the other 11. Simpson ju-
ror No. 8, with his "black power sa-
lute," suggests that such an agenda 
could be a very real problem. 

One potential solution is to lower 
the number of jurors required to 
agree on a decision down to to. This 
allows for a little more leeway in 
assessing the evidence. Still, this 
won't solve the problem of persua-
sion, in the event that nine jurors 
need to convince one more juror to 
change his vote, so that a verdict 
could be reached. 

To prevent unfair persuasion, the 
judge could be present during delib-
eration, monitoring the proceedings 
much like a referee. While not chang-
ing the available evidence, the judge 
would be able to determine whether 
a juror is relenting simply because he 
is tired and doesn't feel like arguing 
anymore, or, alternatively, if he is be-
ing uMecessarily stubbom and is re-
fusing to consider the facts. 

Ironically, most people only 
criticize the system when it fails to 
work for them. But prior to this trial, 
most Americans - specifically 
whites - professed to support the 
justice systemj they accepted its 
high accuracy rate and were com-
fortable with its margin of error. Yet 
after the completion of the trial, the 
complaints began. 

The prosecutors, for instance, re-
fused to accept the verdict, despite the 
fact that they not only subscribe to, 
but abide by the American justice sys-
tem. If they accept the system as the 
best way to decide between innocence 
and guilt, then they mustabiD accept 
the jury 's decision. Christopher 
Darden was the only member of the 
prosecution to recognize this and ac-
cept the jury's verdict. 

In the same way, the American 
public must realize that its com-
plaints should be directed not solely 
at this verdict , but at the entire 
American justice system. Whether 
Simpson committed the murders or 
not, the system failed. If he did com-
mit them, then a murderer was 
wrongly acquitted. Still, some have 
argued that a history of injustice to-
ward MricanAmericans justifies an 
acquittal, even if Simpson killed 
Brown and Goldman. But this logic 
is not only flawed, it is dangerous. 
We must keep in mind that the best 
way to atone for past injustices is to 
provide equal justice henceforth. 

If Simpson did not commit the 
murders, then he was rightfully ac-
quitted. But the system still failed 
- one year and millions of taxpay-
ers' dollars were wasted trying to 
convict the wrong man, while the 
real murderer walks free. (Never 
mind the corruption within the ranks 
of the Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment that Mark Fuhrman exposed.) 

Most Americans were not 
pleased with the verdict. Therefore, 
they should realize that the system 
is flawed. Hopefully, the emotions 
sparJ(ed by Simpson's trial will en-
courage a revision, resulting in a 
more fair and impartial justice sys-
tem.

JOKE: Trial

ContInued from PIle 4 
chain of evidence. He claimed that 
Simpson's blood sample was 
mislabeled. He said that the LAPD's 
forensics lab was a mesa. He proved 
LA cops to be-fools who bumbled 
onto a fresh crime scene, inadvert-
ently destroying evidence like clods. 

Then, when this strategy seemed 
to backfire, Cochran shifted gears and 
elected to go with the JFK route. Sud-
denly, the LAPD was· no longer made 
up of a bunch of bungling nitwits. 
Now, according to Cochran's later 
statements, the lAPD was behind a 
clever and masterful conspiracy . 

The blood at Simpson's house? 
Planted by L.A. cops. The glove at 
the crime scene? Obviously placed 
there by police. The red stains in 
Simpson 's Bronco, driveway and 
clothing? Why, a liule LAPD fairy

sounded ridiculous, but the jury

next minute, call on that SIIN report 
as part of an elaborately timed con-
spiracy. Of oourse, the most impor-
tant aspect of the "conspiracy" ig-

did not have a motive. Simpson, on 
the other hand, most certainly did. It 
WIS all very humorous. 

• The Ito ractor. Listening to 
Judge Lance Ito admonish the law-
yers and the courtroom audience must 
have brought down the house at a for-
eign pub somewhere. Ito continually 
chastised the lawyers for fighting dur-
ing the trial, once telling 0Iris Darden 
to sit down and frequently fining law· 
yers from both camps. 

But he didn't stop there. Ito con-
stantly reprimanded the media for its 
behavior, even kicking out one re-
porter who was rustling around in the 
back row. On the last day of the trial, 
Ito wamed jurors about how "diffi-
cult" it would be to face the hound-
ing television cameras upon leaving 
the courtroom. 

Hilariously, Ito's problems with 
the lawyers, audience and media all 
boiled down to one person: himself.

from beina a circus - by limply """-
iIIg off 1M ClIIrfUtU. 

But instead, Ito look a different 
approICh to dealin8 with IheM fac-
tors. He took the jury out on numer-
oIlS time-consuming "fJeld trips." He 
granted the lawyers several side-bus. 
110 even went so far as appearing on a 
special ollC-On-one interview with a 
local L.A. station at the beginning of 
the trial. Name a normal trial in which 
these kinds of things take place. 

The lawyers squabbled because Ito 
let them. People cried out in the court 
room because Ito had no control. 
Simpson was allowed to make a plea 
to the jury because Ito couldn't think 
of an excuse to say "no." And it all 
played out right in front of the cam-
eras. You could almost see the gleam

their closing arguments. Yes, Johnnie, 
it WIS a very fine - and funny -
performance, indeed.

most humorous aspect of the Simpson 
trial was the jury selection. 

To start, there was the rigorous

because it must have taken some ef-
fort to find 12 people with such little 
brain matter.) In the end, nine blacks, 
two whiles and one Latino were cho-

sen. This is hudly an acc:uI8Ie c:ro.-
-=tion of Simpson'l peen. A more 
suitable jury would have been made 
up of white celebrities and blac:k, 
former foolbaU players. 

In any cue, all the jury members 
had one thina in common. They knew 
virtually nothing about Simpson. But 
how is this possible? I'll buy that 
some of the members missed 
Simpson's Hertzcomrnerciall duri .. 
the '70s and '80s. Other jurors may 
not he football fans, so they didn't wit-
ness his commentaries on NBC. 

But, for God's sake, how did the 
jurors miss seeing the "Naked Gun" 
series? And it's equally scary that 
these t 2 fools didn't see or hear of 
Simpson's freeway escapade. Two 
people are dead and 12 idiots, who 
must live in isolation booths, get to 
decide the verdict. If that wasn't fuMy 
to people outside the United States, I 
don't know what WIS. 

But enough complaining. Now 
that Simpson is a free man, I guesa 
the next step is simple. The LAPD is 
looking for a killer who matches 
Simpson's DNA-type, has feet that 
are Simpson's size and wears gloves 
that would fit Simpson's hands. 

The circus rolls on, and some-
where a Frenchman is laughing.

Editor: 
I hesitate to get on the post-O.J. 

bandwagon, but after reading Dan 
Kraft's column ("Did We Watch The 
Same Trial?" Oct. 5, 1995) and the 
Guardian '5 editorial ("Justice 
Clouded by Racism," Oct. 5, 1995), 
I felt compelled to write. 

As I understand it, the issue of race 
and race-motivated tampering was 
downplayed in the courtroom due to 
Judge Ito's decision to admit only two 
snippets of the Furhman tapes as evi-
dence. Also, Johnnie Cochran's ex-
cessive comparison of Furhman to 
Hitler in his closing arguments prob-
ably offended enough people to make 
Cochran's race approach seem fanati-
cal and, hence, less credible. How-

anal yses and experts, according to 
their various politics. For example, 
Simpson's little tour of the L.A. 
freeway system, depending on the 
station and time of day, was either 

a chase or an arranged police escort. 
As a result, ~r. Kraft, I sug-

gest you word your pbrases a little 
more conservatively when you 
say, " ... aII across the country, Af-
rican Americans sprang to their 
feet injoy." While there were cer-
tainly people of all races .who 
cheered, I am certain that there 
were many who hung their head 
in dejection. Unfortunately, they 
didn't get the air time. 

This case was less about race and 
more about money. Had the defen-
dant been from a lower tax bracket, 
he would have been in San Quentin 
long ago, awaiting lethal injection, 
gassing or electrocution. 

While this case illustrates how di-
vided our country is, it also illustrates 
how the only color that matters in the 
criminal justice system is green.

In his article on campus parking 
("Parking Problems Increase as 
Numbers of 'S' Spaces Dwindle," 
Oct. 2, 1995), Ivan Delventhal over-
looked an important point. While 
the student-parking situation has 
deteriorated in recent years, particu-
larly compared with that of the fac-
ulty and staff, the relative pricing 
of "A", "8" and "s" permits re-
mains virtually the same. 

It is my guess that many students 
would be glad to pay an extra $39 per 
quarter for an " A" parking permit or 
an extra $26.25 for a "8" permit, if 
allowed to do so. However, UCSO 
- by administrative regulation -
ensures that its "preferred" constitu-
ents can buy an "A" or "8" permit at 
a below-market rate, while the under-
graduates are left holding the bag. 

Contrast this with Stanford 
University, where all affiliates-
including undergraduates - can 
buy parking permits of any desig-

~1f1[!' lnsurer 
will not cover the 
co-op's loss 
ContInued from ~ 1 

Because the store's safe is just 
inside an office area, co-op members 
said the thief could have seen them 
dialing the.CQI1lbination. 

The stolen bundle was the larg-
est of the day ,although co-op mem-
bers are uncertain whether the thief 
was aware of this. 

I n addition, keys to the store were 
lost over the summer, and no one 
could say whether they were' stolen 
orsimply kept by past employees-
who never returned them. 

"It's really hard to know if it was 
an inside jobor an outside one," one 
co-op member said. 

The crime most likely occurred 
on Monday night, the store workers 
said, but it is possible that it took 
place on Tuesday. 

The General Co-op, a group of 12 
people who collectively make deci-
sions about the General Store's ~ 
eration, has attempted to solve the 
problem internally. Three seniormem-
bers said that two store meetings have 
been held to discuss the theft, but that 
iittle has been resolved. 

The co-op did decide to tighten 
security, however, installing new 10cks 
and alarms to prevent future thefts. 

The UCSO Police Department 
was unavailable for comment, and 
co-op members said the police have 
not informed them of any leads in 
the case. 

Because the store's insurancewiII 
not cover the burglary, the co-op 
will have to take the theft as a loss. 

Co-op members urge anyone 
with information about the crime to 
come forward, and ask the respon-
sible party to return the checks via 
on-campus mail. If the money is 
returned, the members have prom-
ised to not press charges.

to have a good time." 

The second act - Da Five 
Footer Crew - emerged from 
behind a graffiti-art set. While the 
audience screamed, one of the 
group members shouted into the 
microphone, "Get your fives in 
the air!" 

The set ended with one rapper 
leaning from the stage to high-five 

. members of the audience. 
The OJs returned, as stagehands 

prepared for Otis Day's set. 
For the final act, Otis Day and 

the Knights - his six-piece band 
and backup vocalist - took the 
stage. At that point, the plaza be-
gan to fill up with students. 

The UCSD Ourdian 

A.S. Programmer Kevin ~oo 
agreed. "The atmosphere It the 
Cosmic ~lIIicCamiva1 wupeat," 
he said; "The overall crowd de-
meanor wu very good." 

At the conclusion of the show, 
concert-goers were ushered out of 
the Price Center by Staff Pro per-
sonnel. 

In retrospect, ~oo said he was 
pleased with howUCSO's first 
Cosmic Music Carnival had turned 
out. 

"The event went very well," 
Moo said. "Alloftheperformances 
were strong, and Otis Day was just 
spectacular." 

Edell Shepherd, keyboard 
player for Otis Day and the 
Knights, was also pleasantly sur-
prised with the concert's results.

"Everyone loved Otis," Krauss 
said. "It wasn't quite the turnout ' 
we had expected, but everyone at 
the concert had a good time." 

"It's great when the crowd gets 
into it. It helps a lot," he said."We 
were doing the classics, and it was 
funny coming after a rap group. 
This just goes 19 show that other 
music comes and goes, but the 
classics stay forever."

Not All Fraternity Stereotypes Hold Trl!e 
When young and old students 

converge upon colleges in the search 
of higher education, one vision they 
carry with them is that of the frater-
nities. Whether satirized in movies 
like AniIMl House or the subject of

afternoon talk 
shows, fraternities 
have received much 
notoriety. 

However, very 
little is actually 
known beyond that 
of the stereotypical 
beer-guzzling, sexist 
and irresponsible 
guys eating pizzas. 
One fraternity that 
stands out in the so-

cial throng is Sigma Pi (III). 
Although the fraternity itself is 

over 100 years old and boasts the 
largest number of houses at Califor-
nia colleges, the chapter at UCSD is 
relatively new. It received its offi-
cial charter in 1987. 

Small in membership, III is more 
like friendly group of guys who all 

know each other, rather than a huge, 
faceless mob. At its rush event in the 
Price Center, the members were cor-
dial toward those wandering in to 
investigate the gath-
ering. No one in this 
fraternity was pushy 
or forceful about get-
ting the new faces to 
pledge, as many of 
the other "frats" 
seemed to be. 

I have never liked 
the concept of a fra-
ternity - or a soror-
ity, for that maUer. 
But the sense of 
friendliness - , with 
the occasional feel-
ing of apprehension 
from fellow fresh-
men at the event-
eased my feelings. 

Over the back-
ground noise, I heard the sounds of 
laughter and the grinding blender, 
which mixed various non-alcoholic 
drinks. My attraction to the card 

games at the event also helped me 
leave behind previous notions of 
distaste. The common sight of sweat 
beading on the brows of those play-
ing poker was missing, as were the 

playing chips. 
People played 
the card games 
purely for enter-
tainment. 

I was fortu-
nate to have a 
string of un-
canny luck at 
blackjack, eam-
ing a few jokes 
about taking me 
to Las Vegas. 
However, my 
luck quickly 
turned sour. 
Continuing to 
play despite my 
dwindling luck, 

I found myself at ease among a 
group of complete strangers. 

"Ethnically speaking, we're very 
diverse," said UCSD In President 

Though continuous open bidding - rus 

Mike Adadir. "Interest wise, well, 
we like to party, and we love sports." 

Looking around the small room, 
I could see that the wide assortment . 
of students present - not just in 
terms of race and color - brought 
strength to the organization. My mis-
conception that fraternities are elit-
ist and racially exclusive was shat-
tered. There was no real minority, 
because each person attending the 
party was viewed as "just another 
guy looking for a place where he 
could relax and have a good time. " 

"We're pretty much well-
rounded. We have a few 
former A.S. [Associated 
Students] presidents, " said 
Adadir. "We tend to at-
tract the leader ... the very 
outgoing type." 

An outgoing attitude 
was indeed prevalent in 
the group. During the 
evening, members told 
stories of their "asphalt 
adventures" - broken-

events throughout the year - brings in about 30 new 
members per quarter, fall rush attracts hundreds. 
Here are the totals for number of UCSD students 
joining fraternities and sororities during fall rush. 

The myths and truths of rush week 
always seem to captivate the minds of 
college students. Whether one dares to 
rush or not, many questions about this 
age-old college tradition run rampant 
through students' minds. I too have 
often wondered what rush is really all 
about: Do sororities really moire their 
rushees strip and run nalred across cam-
pus in the middle of the night? Though 
such goings-on mayor may not actuall y 
occur-depending on the universi ty-
rush week at UCSD is a very low-key, 
yet very inviting 
event. 

I ventured into 
the world of "sis-
terhood" to find 
the truth behind 
rushing. To my 
surprise, I found it 
to be a unique 
bonding experi-
ence with my fel-
low UCSD peers. 
This was despite 
the fact that I was one of the very few 
seniors lost among the anxious first-
year and sophomore girls who are, ap-
parently, more of an asset in the eyes of 
the sorority sisters. , 

"I don't want to discourage those of 
you who are seniors, but at times the 
chapters may take into consideration 
whether you will be with them for more 
than one year," c:oafided my pup 

leader. 
Unlike certain 

myths about the 
havoc in rushing, s0-
rorities or "chapters" 
are very organized 
when it comes to rush 
week. Each girl must 
register and pay a fee 
to the UCSD AsSOCiation

tion to become a rushee. As a rushee, each functioned as a welcoming party for the

Greek Fall Ruah 

Dominic Lobbla/GuMrlllfl 

~y,~7, 1995 FEATURES 13 

Rush Festivities Merely 
Break the Ice 

Tuesday, 'during the first week of school, the Greeks 
invaded the Price Center plaza with hastily erected booths, 
banners and representatives. And the hype of rush begins 
once again. The Greek-sponsored event raids the campus 
in search of new members twice a year. 

Suddenly, a friend shows up with an inconspicuously 
conspicuous pin on his shirt, characteristic of a new 
fraternity pledge. Then, his phone is ringing off the hook 
with invitations to rush events, and 
his presence at home quick) y dwindles. 
They've got another one. 

Rush introduces the initiate to 
the fraternity and the fraternity to 

the initiate. It is an information 
fair with food and entertainment, 
a character evaluation and, at 
the end of the week, a judg-
ment day. Both initiates and 
members undergo bilateral 
scrutiny, leading to either a 
happy union or a fork in the 
road. 

To acc'urately assess what 
rush is all about, I went to in-

formation sessions and to several events, posing 
as a rushee. It was like walking onto a lot full of 

used-car salesmen who were trying to sell every 
vehicle imaginable. The sales pitches varied from 
alcohol-frenzied parties stocked with women to 

philanthropic trips benefiting underprivileged 
children. 

And fraternity personalities vary as much as 
freshman dormmates. Rush provides a fran-

tic arena where fraternity members and 
initiates confront their similarities and 

differences. That's probably why it's 
called "rush." (i.e. Let's make it 
through this stuff and get on with it.) 

At the Sigma Chi (IX) opening night, 
members wore shirts and ties, separating 

themselves from initiates, to which one 
member added, "It shows that we are serious 

about what we do and about our-
selves." 

At rusb, a fraternity tries to illustrate the 
importance and honor of becoming a mem-
ber, that not just anybody can join - im-
plying that initiates should possess certain 
character qualities and aspirations. I was 
passed along a social chain and introduced 
not only to other fraternity brothers, but 
also to fraternity history and ideals. The 
lure of San Diego bay cruises and "Hoot-
ers" hollies heeded to more social causes 
and public involvement. The posture of the

IX resembled that of a group of young, well-spoken 
, and cordial professionals, who described themselves 

as a forum of support, motivations and connections. 
None of the "frat-boy" stereotypical attitudes en-
countered at other fraternity occasions permeated 
their events. 

It was more of an information session, asking, 
"Do you feel you're interested in what we're all 
about? If so, join in; if not, it was nice talking to 
you." I certainly didn't feel as though I was the 
subject of a KGB interrogation and background 
check. 

The IX version of rush explained its fra-
ternity as one which brings people together, offering a 
hub of social occasions, alumni connections and an

contrary to the stereotype that fra-
ternities are for the socially inept, 
offering a&yLum to social invalids. 

Part of the attraction to the IX 
chapter was an emphasis on ca-
pable individuals working- and, 
of course, partying - together. 
Weekly meetings and events 
brought members together to par-

their love of athletics. 

Along with the numerous sports-

served several of the stereotypical, 
fraternitychauvinism-typesatirized 
inAnimal House. But as inappropri-
ate and sometimes juvenile the de-
rogatory comments were, they were 
nowhere near the infamous "date-
scoring" fraternity, which blanketed 
trashy television talk shows several 
months ago. It was then when 1 
remembered why I disliked frater-

In my ignorance, I would never 
have believed that fraternities feel 
social responsibility toward the sur-
rounding community - another 
false representation installed in my 
conscience which has since gone 
the way of the dinosaur. 

To earn ever-elusive cash, In 
members engage in coupon-book 
sales and work as Staff Pros, who 
we all recognize as the human block-

tale of how one In member met

Although there were many in-

of the stereotypes dUJ hold true. At 
no point in the evening did a charac-

very eager to talk and to get to know 
the newcomers. 

"Don't be shy to talk about your-
self all night," explained our Rho 
Chi. "The houses really want to get 
to know you. It's all part of rush." 

The faet that each sorority was 
down-to-earth and easy to talk to 
was impressive. The stereotype of 
the dilsy, shallow sorority girl was 
nowhere to be found. 

Besides throwing formal parties 
with fraternities - called "ex-
changes" - each sorority also con-
tributes its time 10 perform charily 
work. Such causes embraced by Ihe 
sororities include visiting convales-
cent homes and reading to children. 

While the rushees and I were on 
our best behavior at each party, it was 
the down-time between each party 
where we let our true colors show, 
complaining incessantly about our 
aching feet And some girls were be-
ginning to lose their voices. 

"~y voice is an octave lower 
from all that talking," said one 
rushee. "You constantly have to talk 
over everyone else in the room." 

Each bouse designed its room ac-

fact, each' bouse filled us rushees with 
punch, cookies and other goodies. 

The process of elimination started 
after Open House Night. The rush-
ees were asked to select their favor-
ite houses. Meanwhile, the sorori-
ties were doing some picking and

choosing of their own. 

"I want you girls to know that the 
information you give us is confi-
dential," explained our Rho Chi. 
"You should not discuss who you 
picked or who picked you because a 
lot of jealousy can occur." 

Oversll, the rushees, including 
myself, were happy with the out-
come of their sorority status. Very 
few girls had dropped out by the 
third night of rush week, and there 
were still two more big nighta ahead. 

So, how does each girl choose 
the sorority that's best for her? 

,.. . 

~oDday, October 9,1995

"You can teU by the impression the 
girls ltave on you, whether you gel 
that totally energized and bonding 
feeling after talking with them." 

"It's that gut feeling," professed 
a Chi Omega (XD) sisler on Theme 
Night. 

Theme Night helped some girls 
decide which sorority to pledge. On 
Ihis occasion, each chaptc:r put on a 
skit 10 emphasize ita sorority's as-
sets. Each of the four skits I attended 
incorporated dance, as well as sing-
ing and acting. This nighl, in par-
ticular, was nice because I actually 
got to sit down and save my already 
scruffed-up thro~t at the same time. 

Though there was one more night 
left, called .. Preference Night," I 
was cut short of attending this event. 
I was not invited back to the first 
two houses of my choice. Prefer-
ence Night is the biggest night of 
rush week, when the remaining rush-
ees attend two houses and have an 
elegant dinner and discussion with 
the sorority members. 

"This is one of the most important 
nights of rush," said the Rho Chi. "It's 
a reaUy personal and emotional night, 
where the girls share something spe-
cial about thcmselvm and their soror-
ity. A 101 of tears are shed. " 

Rush week proved to be a time 
for rushees to get to know one an-
other, as well as getting to know 
each sorority chapter at UCSD. 

"I've met so many people in the 
past few days," a rushee said. 
"People have such a negative image 
about rush week and sororities. 
Those are the ones who have never 
rushed. I'm glad I rushed and found 
out for myself what it's all about."

Airborne: UCSO's Carrie Peer (17) flies In and heads a corner kick past the Panther 
goalkeeper to give the Tritons a 3'() lead on Friday. They went on to win, 4-0. 

Coyotes Bite the Streak 
SNAPPED: After smashing Chapman, the Tritons had their 
miraculous unbeaten streak broken by CSU-San Bernardino 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

It's over. 

Women's Soccer Coach Brian McManus said. 

Almost three years to the day of its last 
defeat, the UCSD women's soccer team suf-

fered a regular-season loss. 
Since falling to Cal 

Lutheran on Oct. 9, 1992, the 
Tritons had amassed an as-
tounding record of 40-0-5 in 
non-playoff games. However, 
on Oct. 8, 1995, UCSD's 45-
game unbeaten streak was 
halted by the ninth-rsnked team 

The Tritons battled the Coyotes through-
out a scoreless first balf, but CSUSB scored 
the eventual game-winning goal at the 65:00 
minute mark of the second half. The differ· 
ence in the game turned out to be a penalty 
kick by Jamie Caffrey, who was awarded the 
kick after UCSD was charged with a hand-
ball inside the goalie box. 

"The player from [CSUSB] struck the ball 
from about two yards away, and our player 
was protecting herself with her hands behind 
her," McManus said. "The ball bit her in the 
upper arm, and a penalty kick was called. " 

in Division II, Cal State-San ~rnardino 
(CSUSB). 

See STREAK, Page 22 

UCSD traveled to San Bernardino 
in hopes of improving ita seasonal 
record to ll-O, but it was just not 
meant to be.

Tritons turned on their jets. The 15·12 Triton 
victory knotted the match It two, going into

UCSD and (])apman battled bard in the

with I comfortable 1 S-8 cushion. 

A huge key to the 
Trilon victory was the 
play of freshman out·

The Tritons added five more points

"I would say that the women are

CWTCH: UCSD came away with a pair of big wins in "must win" games 
vs. Chapman and Washington (MO), to preserve its post-season hopes

Associate Sports Editor 

The bottom line: Win, or forget 
about the post-season. With an un· 
impressive record of 4-4-1, the 

UCSD men's soccer 
team desperately 
needed I victory this 
weekend to stay in 
the pll yoff picture. 

The Tritons 
squared off Ipinst a 
solid Chapman Uni· 
versity team on Fri· 

day, finishing up against equally 
talented Washington University 
(MO) on Sunday. 

UCSD carne through, however, 
posting two, 1-0 victories. and im-
proving its record to 6-4-1. The 
wins kept the Triton playoff hopes 
llive. 

"I put the pressure on, because 

I'm not going to accept anything 
other than being in the playoffs." 
said Triton Head Colch Derek 
Annstrong. "Anything less than that 
is I total disaster, and everybody in 
the program knows that." 

Against sixth-ranked Chipman 
on Friday, the pllyoff Itmosphere 
was evident. with both teams play-
ing scrappy. hlrd-nosed soccer. 
After I scoreless first half. the sec-
ond half began with both teams 
opening their games up -and tak-
ing more chances. 

With about 30 minutes left in 
the game, UCSD began to press 
forward in the quest for a goll. The 
Tritons missed a good opportunity 
when, at 73:13. midfielder Jose 
Ocampo dribbled past three Pan-
ther defenders. firing I shot that 
went wide left of the far post. 

The UCSD pressure finally paid

STREAK: UCSD's 
unbeaten streak stops at 45 
CoRtIn ... from PICe 17 

The Tritons had their chances in the game, 
out shooting the Coyotes, IS-9. The UCSD 
offense put pressure on CSUSB's goalkeeper, 
forcing her to come up with seven saves, 
while Triton netminder Kelly Pearson re-
corded just two. However, UCSO's offen-
sive efforts were not enough to notch a tying 
goal in the waning minutes. 

UCSD entered the San Bernardino game 
on a high, after a huge victory over Chapman 
on Friday. The Panthers were trounced 4-0 
by the Tritons in an aftemoon game at UCSD. 

Ten minutes into the matchup, Lauren 
Johnson came within inches of tallying the 

trolled the ball and promptly riOed I Ihot 
past Panther goalkeeper Rachel Busb. 

"We played well in the begiaains.·"" 
said. "The opportunities will OODle, ., we 
just wlnt to get in the flow of the game, and 
not rush it. Sometimes, if you score early, 
you start to settle back and let up." 

UCSD kept the pressure on in the second 
half. At the 50:36 mark, Ele Johnson picked 
up I rebound in front of the Panther net, and 
.PUnched it in for her 12th goal of the season, 
increasing the lead to 2-0. 

"Once we're up a couple of goals, we 
know Ihat we don't have 10 rush everything 
10 try 10 score," Johnson said. "We can just 
seule down and play our game." 

On this day ,Ihe Triton offense was powered 
by more than just two players. Lauren Johnson 
assisted on two goals, while Carrie Peer and 

game's first goal, 
when her free-
kick ~Iast from 
forty yards oul 
bounced off the 
right crossbar.

board in the 35th minute, when the star lan-
dem of Ele Johnson and Carin Pugh com-
bined on the firsl score of the contest. Johnson 
stole Ihe ball on the left side of the field, 
passing across to a slreaking Pugh, who con-

"We wanted to take control of the ball 
early, and get them on their heels," McManus 
said. " We were not going to sit back [afterthe 
firsl goal]. When you start to sit back on 
defense, that's when you make mistakes."

CLINGING: Triton 
playoff hopes still alive 
ContIn ... from .... 1. 
game," Chilton said. "last year, we battled 
just like this [against Chapman and tied 0-0), 
so this year we needed someone to come up 
big and [Terlecky] did that for us." 

" It was nice to win a tight game," 
Armstrong said. " But it's the weekend [as a 
whole) that is important, not one game." 

UCSD tried to continue its momentum on 
Sunday against the undefeated, ninth-ranked 
Washington University squad. 

Again' playing with the knowledge that a 
loss would almost certainly eliminate them 
from post-season considerations, the Tritons 
came up big, handing the Bears their first loss 
of the season by a 1-0 tally . 

The first half of Sunday 's game played 
oulli~ Friday 's close affair, scoreless at the 
half. After that, however, Armstrong's boys 
started to open up their game, putting pres-
sure on the Bear defenders. 

"They were 10-0-1, and they came out 
very confident in the first half," Armstrong 
said. "Finishing up at halftime, we felt we 
were in it. It was a typical playoff game, 
where you can't really open up, and then let 
the opposition in." 

Eleven minutes into the second half, 
midfielder Joel Kosakoff set up Ocampo on 
the left side of the IS-yard box. Ocampo 
dribbled around one defender, and promptly 
whistled a shot from about 20 yards out. 
However, the Bear goalkeeper was able to 
deflect the attempt just wide of the left post, 
temporarily denying UCSD the lead. 

The Triton pressure finally got to the Bear 
defenders at the 61 :35 mark, as Chris Braga 
scored the game's lone goal. Blake Thomp-
son drove down the right side of the field, and 
crossed to a streaking Shane Farber. Farber's 
shot deflected off the Bear net-minder, 
Stewart Bradley, but Braga was in the right 

place at the right time, punching in the re-
bound IS a Bear defender tried hopelessly to 
head the shot over the nel 

'"The key for us was to pressure their 
defenders, and they finally broke down," 
Farber said. "This was a really tough game, 
but we came through." 

The Tritons will play their third game in 
four days today at 3:30 p.m., as they take on 
Pomona-Pitzer at Triton Soccer Stadium. 

"I didn' t necessarily enjoy these [past 
two] games," Armstrong said. "But winning 
is more important than how pretty you play. 
We're on course now, and we've got to take 
care of Pomona [today)."

Put a Cork 
In This 

Somewhere out there is a 
bueball bat with untold power. 

FlShioncd years ago at a 
hidden shrine located in the 
most remote sector of the 
Orient, it was meticulously 
fashioned by a trained 
woodsmith from the lumber of 
the now-extinct Southeast 
sycamore tree. Nurtured by a 
clan of elderly widowed virgins, 
who kept it wrapped in papyrus 
and cinnamon, it remained 
hidden there for decades so it 
could mature. 

Finally, an aged sensei 
decided it was ripe for use. After 
sprinkling it with holy water, he 
sent it to his long-time friend 
Mike Hargrove, manager of the 
Oeveland Indians. There, it 
found its way into Albert Belle's 
bat rack. 

With that sacred club, Belle, 
traditionally among the league 
leaders in homers, RBis, aver-
age, suspensions and alcohol 
rehabs, did something no other 
human had done in the history 
of baseball: He clubbed 50 
homers and 50 doubles in the 
same year. In doing so, he led 
the historically woeful Indians 
to a division title.

UCSD Breaks Poets' Rhythm 
REBOUND: UCSD got 
a much-needed win by 
slamming Whittier, 22-
6, on Saturday morning 
ByD ... Sw ..... y 
Senior Staff Writer 

So far, the UCSD men's water 
polo team has not had what many 
would consider a stellar season. 

Against top-of-
the-line Division I 
programs, -such as 
Cal-Berkeley and 
Pepperdine, the Tri-
tons have pieced to-
gether a disappoint-
ing, 5-10 record. Yet, 
five of the losses were 

decided by three goals or less, hint-
ing that this squad might be better 
than its mediocre win-loss clip. 

Whittier College would certainly 
vouch for that. It was on the receiv-
ing end of a 22-6 pummeling at the 
hands ofUCSD at Canyonview Pool 
on Saturday. 

"I had hoped that they 'd be a 
little stronger, but they have had 
eligibility problems," said Triton 
Head Coach Denny Harper. "But 
we have to focus on us, and we came 
out and played well."

hands of John Giulianotti, who knew 
exactly what to do with it, deposit-
ing.the ball into the goal for the early 
1-0 advantage. 

in the first quarter, the Poets scored, 
signaling that they were going to try 
to make a game of it. 

Belle knew he had stumbled 
",upon a stick of mythical 

, proportions. He brought it with · 
him to thf( AL playoffs, and he 
used it to rip a home run against 
the Boston Red Sox in Game 
One. 

It took a mere 24 seconds for the 
Tritons to post their first score of the 
game. UCSD's all-time leadint 
scorer, Mike Nalu, made a steal and 
quickly got the ball into the capable 

A scant 30 seconds later, Nalu 
got in on the action with a goal of his 
own, thanks to a Steve Crass assist. 

The result -one minute elapsed, 
two Triton goals. 

However, ,with 4:01 remaining 

That is, until moments later, when 
a Nalu two-point shot found the 
right comer of the net. Crass then 
folJowed with two consecutive goals 
of his own, to vault the Tritons to a 
comfortable 6-1 edge to end the first 
quarter. 

UCSD was not about to sit on its 
lead, beginning the second quarter 
with increased intensity. Behind 
three goals from freshman Doug 
Cole and a relentlessly attacking 
defense, the -team finished the half 
with an insurmountable 12-1 ad-
vantage.

However, Belle was foiled 
when Boston manager Kevin 
Kennedy, suspicious of his 
Ruthian output, asked that the 
bat be confiscated and checked. 
After all, BelJe was suspended 
the previous season for using a 
corked bal Skill alone could not 
account for the numbers he put 
up, Kennedy reasoned.

Of course, nothing so 
mundane as cork was found. 
This bat draws its incredible 
power from ornate workman-
ship and inherent mystic 
properties of an untold nature. 

Not knowing this, basebaU 
officials deemed the enchanted 
stick of lumber harmless and put 
it in storage. 

- Four days later, Edgar 
Martinez of the Seattle Mariners 
inexplicably uDOOvered a 
foreign bat in his locker. Finding 
himself strangely drawn to it, he 
decided to use it in that night's 
playoff game against the 
Yankees. 

In that game he drove in seven 
runs - a playoff record - on a 
grand slam and a three-run homer.
