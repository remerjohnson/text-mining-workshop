the University Center Planning Board (UCPB). Deja I'll. . 

Much of the discussion locused upon the UCPB's development process Itself. 
Critic5 of the process expressed a concern that the subcommittees rragmented 
the development of interdependent components of the Student Cel1l ~r. ome 
time was spent discussing the development of a clear defmllion of d Studem 
Controlled FaCility ." 

Both the Co-op Subcommittee and the UCPB repr~sentatlve. stressed rhe 
need for continual and extensive student mvolvement m the entire process of 
developing plans for the University Center. The present su~commitlee~ are: 
Conference/ Meeting RoolTIS / Multi-purpose Room; Food Services; Recreational 
Services (Billiards, Table Games. Eleclronic Games, etc.); Co-ops & Enterprises; 
Office Space (ASUCSD, UEO, Student organiz..Jtions, University Center Staff);

in July, 1980, when it was his time to 
regIster. "At the time I didn'r know how 
I would protest. Rather than goi ng 
public I dwded to remai n qUiet and 
not register," said Marsh . 

"I did nmhing in protest for twO and 
a half years as a studem here. One year 
was spent in Egypt with the Education 
Ahroad Program in which I wrote a 42-
page paper on ~andhi 's doclrines of 
non -violence. (While in Egypt 1 made 
the deCISIOn to go pubitc in protest of

I became II1volved with the San Diego

"With no c1.1 sifications there obviously

registmnt could have JS little itS 11 days 
after Iheir draft notification to compile 
eVidence for their case. A non-registrant 
has whatever additional time JVJilable 10 
them before registralion 10 prepare their 
case. Thi s could IOtal several years," said 
Jahnkow. 

"Registration is not considered ... 
statement by the Selective Service which 
can be used 10 seek a CO or any other 
deferment." S..lid Col. EbeL "It is Simply 
the first Step in a process for a CO 10 
receive CO status." 
WHAT ARE THE LEGAL REPER-
CUSSIONS OF NOT REGISTERING FOR 
THE f)RAFT? 

"There IS no Selective Service 
prosecutIon of young men who do nm 
register," s ... ld Col. Ebel. "If we have ... 
case of an indiVidual who has not 
responded 10 our three wilrnll1g letters 
we turn his name over to the 
Department of Ju tice." 

In the three and .1 half years since the 
reenactmem of dmft registration the 
Selective -ervice repons, .IS of fall 1983, 
409,000 ehglble males h.we fatied to 
register. DUring 1983. the SSS sent the 
n,lmes or 75 ,000 men to the Ju tlce 
Depanment for II1vestigiltion because 
these men bad not registered <Ifter 
receiving the three SS w,1rning letters. 
The Justice Department randomly 
selected 100 (.13%) of these men to 
investigate. To date 16 men have been 
prosecuted, seven have received 
convictions and two j.Ill sentences. It is 
not known if action will be wken 
against Ihe remaining 74,900. 

"One of the purposes of prosecuti on 
is to deter others from violating th e 
law: said Jssistant U Attorney Roben 
Rose or an Diego, prosecuting Jttorney 
in the now famoLls Ben Saswa), tnJI. In 
,I governmem report Selective Sen'ice 
om i.ll Joan LImb s.1Ic1 the wave of 
1982 indictments caused the number of 
men regi tenng e.lch momh to jump 
from 120,000 to 150,000. 

"The Department of JustICe has had 
recent setbacks 111 their efforts to

Kissinger report poor plan for Americas 
By JAMES ROSBERG 

Recently the Commission on Latin 
America, headed by Henry KiSSinger, 
recomillended in~reases in the level of 
c~onomic and mili ta ty <lid presently 
given to certain conselV.1tive Ce ntral 
Amencan regimes for the purpose of 
allaying ,l nd defe.lting populJr 
revol ut ions, 

Not urpns ingly, PreSident Re'lg,lrI 
useu the repon's rceomll,!end,ltions to 

relationship depended on the foreign 
aid Nicaragua received from the US, 
Nicaragua n lies with the Cubans ,1I1d 
Soviets were mll1imal. The US abruptly 
discontinued the aid , charging the 
alldinistils with smuggling anns to the 

Salv"doran gueri llas, 
Washington has ne\'er been able to 

prove th,l[ there was actually an)' 
smugghllg of arllls. WithoLll ,IllY alu , the 

Supporting weak regimes is a risky business 
which can contribute to diminishing our world 
power, 
requcst huge increJses in .l Id , includmg 
.l billion dollar package for EI Salvador. 
This IS sheer foolishness since the 
Kissinger report is severel), deficient as 
an outl ine for United St.ltes strJtegy in 
Cemr.ll Amenca; its reasoning and 
conclusions are based on erroneous 
premises, 

The commission advanced two basic 
premises to guide US policy in Central 
America. First , popular revolutions in 
Ce ntral America indirectly threaten US 
security by heightening Soviet and 
Cuban in fluen e in the region. Secondly. 
Ameri an power "to innuence events 
worldwide would be significantly eroded 
from the perception that we were unable 
even 10 influence events loutcomes of 
revolts) close at home when we 
ourse lves had ,1 vital interest in those 
evems." 

Neither o[ the e two premtses is 
supported by evidence, they are merely 
assumptions, In fact. there is 
considerble evidellce that these 
assumptions are incorrecl. 

Revolutionary regimes in Central 
America are not in any way predisposed 
to a non-cooperative Eastern-oriented 
foreign policy. The laSl (wO Central 
American revolutions, the Cuban and 
the Nicaraguan were in the beginning 
unsure of the course of their foreign 
relations and were only laler forced into 
a partnership with the EaSlern block by 
American hos(i1ity. 

After they came 10 power, the 
SandiniSlas had fairly strong ties with 
the US. The existence of this 

Nicaragua ns had no choice bUl to turn 
10 the Soviet Unio n . 

A simi lar situation existed 20 years 
e'lrlier between the US and Cuba. The 
Cubans were eventually forced into the 
Soviet orbi t by a US plockadc and 
American-supported inVilsion attempts. 

Central American revolutions are not 
in nately hostile to the US, The fact that 
the US is so powerful means that new 
regimes are willing 10 fonn strong tics if 
they arc not alienated by embargoes, 
boycotts and insurgcllcy, 

Nei ther do successful Central 
American revolutions actively attempt to 
destabilize other regimes in the region , 
Though countless charges have been 
made that the Ni'caragu.ms have 
smuggled Cuban or Soviet arms into EI 
Salvador, not a scrap of evide nce for 
these charges has been produced. 

The guerillas get their weapons from a 
demoralized , diso rganized Salvadoran 
arm)'. Moreover, after the Cuban 
revolution there wasn 't a su cessful 
revolution in Central America for 20 
ye,lrS and eve n then Cuban influence 
was minimal and certainly not necessary 
for the success of the revolution , 

To claim that US interests are 
threatened by Central American 
revolutions is ridiculous if; a) the 
revolutionary regimes are willing to 
cooperate with the US and b) these 
regimes do nOt actively promote 
revolution. 

American world power will not be 
diminished by a decision to abandon 
the archaic regimes of Central America.

support. Bur U imcrvention has no 
bearing on whether or not" guerilla 
movemem gets off the ground 

Funhermorc, lhose allies who dre so 
wCelk thilt ti,ey depend on us to 
preser\'c Stolle power will conllnue to 
depend on us bec"use they h,we 
nowhere else to go (the SOVie t UnIOn 
has an equal or worsc trJck remrd) 
Thosc .lilies who do not depend on us 
for reJsons 01 II1ternal security are allies 
because they sh,lre the same tmere tS in 
global economic and mtlitJI)' affairs; 
they 100 have nowhere else to go. 

Refusing to support powerl~ss regimes 
wi ll not diminish the United States' 
interna tionJI power. Clearly, continued 
milit.lry aid to [he dictatorships of 
Ce mral America is not warranted on the 
basis of the findings of the Ki ssi nger 
commission , 

It is quite possible that followi ng a 
policy of supporting weak regimes such 
as the Salvadoran ,md Gua temalan will 
seriously u,lmage American interests. We 
will be drawn into costly connicts to 
support weak allies and we will alienate 
revolutionary governments with strong 
popular support . 

Mallltaining weak regimes III danger 
of revolution, elS mC5! Ce ntral American 
stJtes are , is an UndHrJ!:' ive proposition. 
By taking responsibility for cominuing 
its rule, our assistance takes away any 

demand increaSingly large amounts of 
miluaty aid for its maintenance or 
allowing a losing term investment to slip 
away. 

Fighting on the Side of a government 
that lacks popular suppOrt tS only a 
drain on the economy and rarely 
accrues any benefits. ThiS has been the 
experience of the US III both Vitenam 
and EI S"lvJdor and the Soviet's III 
Afghanistan 

Supportlllg we,lk rcglmes IS a risk), 
busml'ss which can conmbutc to 
d Imll1lshlllg our world power b} 
squandenng resources alld eff rt, 

It can be Jrgued that supporting a 
weak Ce ntral American regime is in the 
US tmerest sll1ce the development of a 
stronger may threaten vital II1terests in 
the region. But skillful diplomacy on the 
part of the US could create a community 
of imerests with these newly powerful 
states and head off any potenllal 
confli Ct. 

Also. the military and economic 
power of the United States is a fairly 
strong dete rrent to any aclton 
challenging American interests. Finally, 
we must ask ourselves If it IS eth ical to 
deny the political development these 
impoverished societies desperately need . 

Continued militilty ,lid to EI Salvador 
and other weak regimes in Central 
America IS foohsh . To aUow the rebels to 
come to power is nOt only recognizing a 
national right of the people of EI 
Salvador but is "Iso opening the door to 
an alliance with a strong, well sup po ned 
Ct'ntral American state . 

Fighting on the side of a government that lacks 
popular support is only a drain on the economy and 
rarely accrues any benefits, 
incentive on the recipient government's 
pan to broaden its own suppon. 

Consequently a popular revolution 
eaSily gains enough momentum to 
challenge the authority of the local 
government. We are then drawn into 
the unwanted predicament of either 
choosi ng to suppon a government 
which will probabl)' not be able to 
capture popular suppOrt and hence 

Cenain interests in the US may 
benefit from oligarchic rule in EI 
Salvador but the great bulk of Americans 
would not be affected adversely if a new 
regi me CJme to powe r. Cenainly saving 
$1 billion on military and economic .lId 
as Reagan has proposed would 
ultimately benefit most Americans more 
than the persistence of EI Salvador's 
repressive regime.

UCSD's Irons overturns 
Supreme Court ruling 
By PHIL WlLLON 

D ue to documents uncovered b}' UCSD Professor Perer Irons, Li Federal juclge recently ovenurned ,I 19++ upreille Coun clecl~lon 
which upheld the legality of the Internment of over 
110,000 jap,mese Americans for security re,lson~ 
cluring Worlcl W,lr II . and of rhe conVIction of Fred 
Korem.ltsu, who challenged the governmcnt .1etiOn. 

M.lteri.tl shOWing that the Justice Department 
knolVlllgly withheld the Illform.llIon , saying rhat no 
eVidence existed to suppOrt ch,lrges of e pion,lge by 
the Japanese American population - evidence Irons 
d'lllm 10 h,l\e obtained through the Freedom of 
Inforln,uion Act. 

At rhe rllne, the Political Science Profe sor .md 
Hatvard L.)IV School grJduare was writing a book on 
the bndm.lrk cases of Koremi1tsu and two other mcn 
who refused to obe), the govcrnmem order. He w.l'; 
curious as to how uch a bl,ltJnt dlspl.ty of r.1CtSm 
could be approved by both our Suprcm~ Court ,md 
Presldem Roosevelt in a country that boasts of 
"freedom Jnd justice for all." 

The Court'S ruling stemmed largely on the statement 
of Wesr CO,lSt mililat)1 commander General J.L. Dewllt 
whl) claimed rhat there existed ship-to-shore sign.lling 
by Japanese Americans to warships off the West Coast. 

_ "A Jap is a jap," Dewitt saicl. "It makes no dlfference 
whether he is an American citizen or not; he is still 
japane e .. and the japanese race is the enemy race." 

But in a document thar was discovered by Irons, 
both FBI Director J Edgar Hoover and the officials at 
the Federal Communications Commission told the 
justice Depanment's lawyers that they could find no 
evidence of the War Depanment's accusations. 

Because of pressure coming from the War 
Depanment, rhe justice Department never submilled 
those findings to the Supreme Court. 

Irons called it a miscarriage of justice Jnd added 
thai if the cruciJI evidence was given , the internment 
of the 110,000 west COJS! J.lpanese Americans would 

proh.lbly never h,II'e happened 
Regardless of the It1fonnatlon withheld , the 19+1 

Supreme Coun deCISion upheld whJt IS constderecl 
perhaps the "worst Viola tion of ~' ivil rights since 
sl.lVcry" 

"ExclUSIOn for .1 thre,llened Jrea , no less rhat curfew. 
has .1 definite and close rcl.ltIonship ttl Lhe prevention 
of esp ionage Jncl sabOtage," said Justice Hugho Black, 
representing the opinion of rhe coun In KorcrJlw su I S. 
Unllcd Swtes. oncluded B1.lCk, "We could nor reject 
rhe flndlt1g of'rhe military Juthoritle that it W.1S 
impOSSible to bring .lbout an ImmedlJte segregation of 
the disloy.ll from the loyal." 

The documents found by Peter Irons prove that the 
military never did , It1 fact. hJve .IIlY el'ldence of tllicit 
behal'lOr among thc Japanese Amenc.lt1s. 

This r.lcial claSSification Violated the jap,mese 
Amcric,ms' (three-quaners of whom were U.:'. citizen) 
constltutionJI gU.lrantee of equal protection under rhe 
1,1111• 

The 110,000 japanese AmrrlcJn were never 
charged with a crime. They never had .1 trial or 
he.uing • .md were never conVicted of anything. Yet 
they served three years of their lives lIl 'prison , many 
of them losing their homes Jnd businesses. Their lives 
were shallered. 

"The co n titution says that no person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due 
process of law," Irons said wilh great emotion. "You 
cannot be ordered into detention without a trial. This 
is rhe only time in history that the Supreme Coun 
d iSJgreed." 

List ovember, Federal judge MaTilyn Patel erased 
Fred Korematsu's 40-year-old conviction. But more 
importantly, she granted a petition thaI Korematsu 
submitted which Slates that the military deliberately 
fabricated evidence of the JJpanese American 
involvement in espionage and SJbmage Jnd thJI they 
kept this infonnation from rhe upremc Court 

While the Justice Depanment m,lY appeal the 
contents of the petition , they dId file a motion 
.Igreeing thJt the conviction should be vacared as "an 
unfortunJte episode In our nauon's hiStory." 

Judge P.lle! Viewed thts meek government response 
to [he ca,e as "tantamount to a confession of error. 

'They just clon 't want to take any of thc 
rcsponslblltty for the misconduct they com mitted 40 
)'e,l rs ago," Irons sa id later. 

The two other men who also refused to obcy tht 
1942 order were Mlnoru Y.1SUI and Gordon 
Hirab<lY,lshl Both of them viol.ued the curfew tholt \\'a'\. 
plJced on JII Japanese Americans .lfrer rhe bombrng of 
Pearl H"rbor. Their retrial!. arc stili pending. and both 
men also fried separate petttlon~. 

Yasui . Hlrabayashl and Korem<1tsu were all born rn 
rhe Untted tates and were legal CItizens at the time 01 
their arrests. 

The three mcn had been tryrng ro reopen rhetr case 
for some time. "The problem has always been gertmg 
the evidence to prove our case: said Ya ui -That's 
when Peter Irons came in . There's no question rh,ll he 
was the reJson my case was reopened." 

Yasui was a lawyer and officer in the Army Re el've., 
.11 the time of his arrest. The day afrer Pearl Harbor he 
wcnr to rcport for mtlitary duty. but the army refused 
10 rake him because of his race. When the ),oung Yasul 
heard of the curfews thar WCTe being unposed on 0111 
JJp.mesc Americans he turned himself In to rest the 
constitutionJhty of the Jctlon. He was convicred ,:md 
spenr nine monrhs in solt ral), conf1nemcnr. 

"Obvtously it was a manifeSlJtlon With deep rooted 
n,l[Ional prejudice: said Yasul. 

There hdd existed Jiang htstory of hostlltty agamsr 
the japanese des<;endants on the West Cast even 
before the war. A lot of It was due to the fact that they 
were very successful rn their busrnesses Jnd on their 
farms. Caucasldns felt that they were the competition 
Jnd were eager to get Tid of them. 

Fred KoremdlSu was Jrresred hecause he remained 
in the San Francisco .Hea in violation of the military 
order excluding his race from the entire western halves 
of California, Oregon and Washington. 

He was waiting on it streercorner for his fiance 
when <1 patrol car pulled up beside him. -That's when I 
knew something was wrQng in DenmJrk ," recalled 
Korematsu. 

KoremJlsu did not wish to 'test' the internment as 
the other two genrlemen did, he merely wanted to

Closing the way to exodus 
By INGRID GREENBERG 

VictOr, like many students 111 the 
crowd , wears LeVI'S blue jeans and a 
traditional bunon-down collared shirt. 
He appears to be an average student, 
but Victor has lived a unique chIldhood. 
Until the age of fourteen he lived in a 
jewish neighborhood in Odes5a, U' R. 

Victor's parems had fortunately 
chosen ,he year 1977 to leave the Soviet 
Union whe.h It and )5 other nations 
signed the HelsinkI Agreemel1l , pledging 
"thei r respect for human nghrs and 
fundamemal freedoms ." World pressure 
oblig,ued the Soviet Ul1Ion to release 
16}36 jews that year. which included 
Victor. an onl), son of his parems. 

However, the Soviet govemment puts 
enormous obstacles in the way of 
anyone who tries to exerrise hiS nght to 
emigr,lle. and many Jews are denied this 
right. ince 1979. when a peak sum of 
51,320 visas were issued, the Soviet 
UnIOn has awarded fewer ,md fewer 
VIsa? just IdS[ year, in 198), the jewish 
emigration from the Soviet Union fell to 
the lowest point ill neMly 20 years: 
2.688 visas. 

BaSIcally, Russian jews arc dented the 
nght to their own. the right to practice 
their own reltgion . and the right to live 
in the land of thcir chOice. 

open the Russian pons "The Soviet 
Union wanted to show that they would 
let Jews go," explained Victor. "The)' 
always want LO come OUt with a clean 
and JUSl record." In 1977, the Soviet 
Union allowed anyone to emigrate dS 
long as he had papers and a decent 
record . 

However. usually the process proves 

period of three to four weeks. Within 
this limit, ,1 new set of documents must 
be filed . certtfying thdt the dpplicant has 
resigned from work or school and has 
paid for ,my repairs that the authorities 
deem necessary on the apartment being 
vacated. He must also pay 770 rubles 
(about $900) before he can lose 
citizenship 

said Victor. "not necessarily because 
they have something against you, but 
your supervisor is afraid. If he lets you 
work there then he's agreeing with your 
ideas." 

Frequently, much fear and doubl 
arises among the families sharing an 
apartment. "It would be very hard for a 
non:Jewish family to ilccept your 
depMture . There would be a lot of 
hatred. Neighbors would believe thilt the 
remdining families dgree with the jewish 
family. " 

The Fuks filmily did not confront 
much co nflict or peer pressure. Odessa 
IS densely populated with jews, and 
Ihey lived wlm twO other jewish 
families. 

Typically. one thll1ks of New York as 
the waystallon for European immigrants. 
However. Victor and hIS parents came 
to San Diego. since their uncle , who had 
left Russlil eight months eilrlier, had 
settled there. 

Once the Fuks family received their 
VisaS, diey could not immediately 
embark toward America. They new to 
Vienna, where after a few days they got 
their papers processed. Then they 
waited 111 Rome for three months until 
they received permiSSIon from the 
U 111 ted tates government to enter. Initially. Victor's parents tried to hide 

from their son their attempt to leave. 
His father wanted to leave ten years 
before the actual departure. but his 
mother was scared LO face the senous 
consequences.

Marshall's 'interim' job safe for now 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

His credentials were not outstanding, 
Three yeJrs as he,ld cOdch of the Ndval 
Training Swion .It Tre.lsure Island , 
fo llowed by two yeJrs as Clai remont 
High School's junIOr varsity head coach. 
Then twO years as head COJch or EI 
Cajon High School (where he compiled 
a respectable record) and two years as 
assistant coach at UCSD. But when john 
Block depaned to Oral Robens for an 
assistant coaching job (and $30.000 
more 111 salary) at the end of last season , 
Tom Marshall was the logical choice as 
Block's successor. Athletic Director judy 
Sweet made the announcement with 

Tom MarshaU: A c()(Jchingjuwre at UCSD? 
obvious reservations, saying that 
"Marshall would be this year's interim 
head coach or men's basketbalL" Sounds 
like a fairly good non-commltl,\I 
committal. However, Marshall was 
overjoyed with the opponul1lty, probably 
because he never thought it would 
present itself. "( thought th il t j ohn 
(Block) was going to be here for some 
time:' 5<lid Marshall Friday arternoon, "I 
thought thol t my first head coaching 
position would be somewhere else." 

One of the Triton coach's strongest 
asse ts is tackling adversity with a smile. 
Even though UCSD lost every stalter 
[rom laS! year's squad , MarshJU was 
optimi stic about the 83-84 campaig~ 

despite being hired so I.ue that 
recruiting was virtually an impOSSibility 
"If we play within ourselves, pIJy 
olggressive Jefense, and don 't commit 
mental mistJkes, we are going to do 
very well III our league this year," said 
Marshall on the eve of the season 
opener in November. 

But midway through his first season 
a's head coach of a collegiate team , 
Marshall finds his club "uttering with .I 
1·4 mark in the league (Point Lom.1 
leads the Southern Division .:It 4-1) and 
.16-12 ovemll. "We haven't shown that 
we can sustain a consistency over the 
long run ," said the TrIton coach , "I'm 
still looking for some consiste nt pla y 
from the guys. Anyone gJme , Jny one 
or twO or them an have a good game, 
but I need thelll to pia}' Jt a conststent 
level every II1gle g,lme, not one or two .. 

Still. many rookie coaches with .1 
I.lckluster record would get down on 
themselves, questlol1lng cenolin tacti c.11 
de isi.ons they have made , doubting 
whether they C.lJl do a competent Job -
but not Marshall. He remall1s his ever 
prescnt optimistic self, talking about the 
upcoming NAIA playons with the 
enthusiasm (and 5<l\'V}') of a Bobby 
Knight. ·We Will be in good position if 
we can go 4-4 in 'our remJinmg eight 
league games," said Marshall . "I don't see 
any reason for the team not to 
oIccomplish thal." 

As (or his own future, MarshJil said 
that he reels secure in his current 
position. Th,It is a rar cry from 
September, when the Triton coach did 
nO! know where he would be in March, 
But with .I vote of confidence from 
Sweet and some excellent recrulling 
underway, Marsh'lll is al ready exclled 
about next sedson's prospects. "I h,we 
been actively seeking out potenti.ll 
student-athletes ror next year," Solid 
Marshall , who spends at least 50% of 
his time recrui ting. "I wi ll be going to 
twO high school games tonight looking 
at some players whom I feel will fit into 
our program." 

When he says "fit into our program : 
Marsha ll isn't referring to the blue-

chippers who expect d free ride In 
college - qUite to the contrary. Marshall 
lIseS UCSD's reputation as a 
motivational tool to dttraCt athletes who 
want a degree from a highly regarded 
institution. ThJt is a different approach 
than that of many of his predecessors, 
who looked upon the stringent 
oldmission requirements as a hindrolnce. 
"This school is one or the finest in the 
country, Jnd athletes who CMe about 
their education will w.tnt to come here :' 
said Marshall But the picture is not' 
quite as rosy as it seems. Because of the 

highly competitive .tdmission process 
here, mJny athletes who fit Marshall's, 
desc ription are deni ed admittance, This 
has to be the most frustrating aspect of 
coaching at UCSD. After spending a 
great deal or time recruiting alhletes 
who decide that they would like to 
come to UCSD, Marshall has to cope 
with the disappointment or them not 
gaining acceptance to the school ror one 
re.lson or another. "It is frustration , but 
it is JUSt something you have to deal

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. UCSD Spirit night hJS become UCSD Spirit 
weekend this year as students from the four colleges as well as graduJte students will 
hoop and holler Friday evening in the pJvihon during the men's and women's 
basketball g,lmes, but save some or thcir energy lor the sixth annu,ll All-Campus 
Intramural <;wlmmmg ChJmpionshlps on Saturday. The Spirit ight b,lsketball contests 
will oe the St,md.lrd eardrum busting nOise which should be run . But the SWIIll meet 
hJ :, ,111 added ,Iumction thiS year. Instead of takll1g place at UCSD's Indoor 'JtJronum 
.IS has been th e CJse in ye.trs P,ISt, the pJrti cip<\nts will enjoy the lU XUries .ll1ordcd by 
the ncw anyon VICW pool. Immmur ... 1 co-director Mike HIPP , who ';\'ilI occup>, the 

po~ ition 01 "meer dlrecror" for clturd,ly's event. h,IS been wid IhJt the new pool will 
allow lor f.l ster times because or the way the pool IS de igned. Water is \~Jte r and 
Hipp Isn't quite sure why SWimm er claim tholt a pool's structure C,\I1 ... rfect theIr speed, 
but II .tppears th.lt thIS tS the case One change for certain m the Sixth Jnnual I!> 
reduCllon of lhe human element. The CJnyon VIew pool orrers electronIc timmg which 
will replJce stopwatches. Although swimming is basicJlly an individuJI SpOrt. this meet 
will be structured with .I team concept as the participants will be swimming for their 
panicular college. According to Hipp "When people get to lhe pool. they only feel like 
they're swimming for themselves. but once the teams rorm it 's" lot more run ." The 
meet wraps up with relay cventS and Hipp Jdds. "It's fun becJuse teJms are rormed 
nght there on the spot." In the polS!. the majority of the partIcipants swam on their 
high school teJm or in some other form of competition. But any UCSD student (with 
the exception of intercollegiate swimmers) can enter and all are encouraged to do so. 
With a "faster' pool, records arc vulnerable . The only mark still on the books rrom the 
first annual in 1979 1S the men's 400 rreestyle held by Pat Vogele. Last year, two men's 
Jnd six women's records wcre broken. There should be a lot more pencil erasing 
S,uurdJY. And where WIll Mike Hipp be during all the excitement? Said Hipp, "I may' 
sit up on the roof and watch this baby!" 

NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. just hours alter I critICized th e ,\[\onal Hackmg 
LCJgue (NHL) for tOO much violence, I receIved some unwanted suppon from the 
Montreal Canadiens. The Canadlens, known ror years as a finesse team, have just 
hired a boxing trainer to "help the teJm improve its fIghting ability." George Drouin . a 
boxing trJiner in Canada for 38 yeJrs. showed up at the Montre,d Forum before 
Monday's practice and installed a punching bag and other boxi ng equipment for the 
Canadiens to use before and after practices. Montreal coach Bob Berry says that 
Drouin will be used Strictly as a "conditioning instructor." Berry meant to say that 
Droull1 will be used Strictly as an instructor on how to fight under any condition. 
Drouin has been anJlyzing the Canadiens' style of "play" for a few years now and he 
hJS come to these conclusions: "Some or the guys have been using their arms instead 
or punching properly. Take (rorward) Pierre Mondou. ror example. He has a good righl 
hJnd but he doesn 't know how to use it. He can put you away with one punch ir he 
learns how. Or Chris Nilan, who has;] tremendous left hook. He could use it more 
effect ively." League officials claim that fighting is part of the game. ObViously. this is 
true, but It IS a shame that it is not a result of a "boys-will-be-boys" attitude on the Ice, 
but rather. by design . Fighting is encouraged by the league. especially considering the 
inSignificant penalty usuaDy imposed on players (five m!nutes in the penalty box) as a 
result or fighting. It seems th,u the NHL is making no effort to shed its VIOlent image , 
and. in fact. appears to be heading in the opposi te di rection. Before long we should 
expect to see players serving penaley minutes for losing in a fight or not fighting at aU . 
Free penalty shots will be awarded for knockdowns or drawing blc.vd and an 
automatic goal will be awarded to the team that can score a knockout. Drouin says th,\[ 
he will train the Canadiens to come out fighting and get respect around the league. 
Maybe around the le.!gue itselr but not outside it. 
NEXT QUESTION PLEASE DEPT. J hursday's question. When the Miami Dolphins 
defeated the Washington Redskins. in the Super Bowl on janu.try H . 1973. to fll1lsh 
with a perfect 17-0 seJson record . which players were on the stJrting olTenslve team? 
Answer: Backfield: Bob Griese. Larry Csonlw and Jim Kiick: receivers: Howard Twilley. 
Paul Warfield and Marv Fleming: linemen: Wayne Moore. Norm Evans. Bob 
Kuechenberg. Jim LJnger. and Larry Little. Today's question: Which league h,ls won 
more World Series? Which teams have never won a Series sillce open ing in their 
current ci ties? Answer in Thursday's issue.
