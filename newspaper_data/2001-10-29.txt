Revelle council 
opposes censorship 
RCC passes resolution in . 
response to The Koala 
By DANIEL WArn 
Contributing Writer 

The Revelle College 
Council denounced hate 
speech and opposed censor-
ship in a resolution passed Oct. 
23. 

RCC Director of 
Electronic Communications 
AJex Schafgans wrote the reso-
lution. 

The council passed the res-
olution in response to the con-
troversy over the latest issue of 
The Koala and its subsequent 
condemnation by Thurgood 
Marshall College Student 
Council. 

The council first discussed 
creating a resolution at its Oct. 
16 meeting. Koala editor 
George Liddle attended the 
meeting. He defended The 
Koala and addressed the coun-
cil's concerns. 

"People are mad because 
we stopped picking on fat 
chicks at Revelle, retards and 
jesus having butt sex with 
chickens [while) high on crack 

<oocaine," Liddle said, referring 
to topics touched upon during 
The Koala's 20-year history. 

Some RCC members con-
ceded that TMCSC's resolu-
tion went too far. 

"It is absurd to request that 
The Koala does community 
service," Schafgans said. "Ou~ 
resolution shouldn't propose 
any action items like commu-
nity service, but should ask The 
Koala to use discretion." 

Publications other than The 
Koala were also discussed. 

Liddle accused the 
Guardian of hypocrisy for pub-
lishing an Oct. 4 editorial con-
demning The Koala on the 
same page as a cartoon he said 
he feels encouraged guns at 
schools. 

The cartoon depicted a 
father telling his son to handle 
a bully at school by taking his 
gun and letting "Mr . .45 talk 
for you." 

"The GUllrdian cartoon is 
offensive," Schafgans said. "I 
wouldn't mind trying to deal 
with that as well ." 

RCC Chair Mark Stickel 
compared reactions to The 
Koala with those to other pub-
lications.

Student threatens to jump 
Woman stabbed herself on overpass above 1-5 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

San Diego police thwarted an 
apparent suicide attempt by a 
UCSD student on the evening of 
Oct. 24. The 20-year-old female 
threatened to jump from the obel 
Drive overpass onto Interstate 5. 

The ordeal halted traffic for 
hours. 

The woman stabbed herself 
twice in the abdomen with a knife, 
said San Diego police spokesman 
Bill Robinson. 

She was wearing a UCSD T-
shirt. 

The woman lost conciousness 
around 9 p.m. and police were able 
to remove her from the overpass. 

Paramedics took her off the cat-
walk of a sign attached to the 
bridge using a ladder truck parked 
on the freeway. 

She was then reportedly taken 
to Scripps Memorial Hospital La 
jolla for psychological evaluation. 

According to Robinson, the 
woman had "mental problems" and 
has not been charged. 

Northbound 1-5 was closed 
for three-and-a-half hours, and 
reopened around 10:30 p.m. 
Officers blocked traffic on Nobel 
Drive, and the California 
Highway Patrol diverted traffic 

Scott Thomas/Guardian 

Slopping traffic: The San Diego Police Department and the Fire Department of 
San Diego rescue a distraught woman, blocking Interstate 5 Wednesday night 

from northbound 1-5 onto 
Highway 52 . 

Traffic backed up as far south as 
Mission Bay. 

Triton Taxi to run on Halloween night 
Student requests prompt temporary expansion of service 
By RAY HENGST 
Contributing Writer 

Triton Taxi, the A.S. Council's 
safe ride home service, will operate 
Oct. 31 from I I p.m. to 3 a.m. 
because many students are expect-
ed to go off campus that night, 
according to A.S. Commissioner of 
Services and Enterprises Colin 
Parent. 

Parent said that Triton Taxi may 
use up to three vans on Halloween, 
depending on how many people 
use the service. 

"There are a number of organi-
zations, individuals and persons 
holding parties on Halloween," 
Parent said. "The way the program 
is set up, anyone who needs the ser-
vice is going to be able to get ahold 
of it."

Parent said that it was Muir 
College Council member Stephen 
Reis' idea to run the Triton Taxi 
service on Halloween. 

"I know that people like to go 
out and have a good time on 
Halloween," Reis said. "I know that 
people would be wi ll ing to use [the 
Triton Taxi service) ." 

Reis said that last year, because 
Halloween was on a weeknight and 
fewer taxis run during the week 
than on weekends, some people 
were left behind. 

"More transportation was need-
ed," Reis said. 

Triton Taxi typically tuns Friday 
and Saturday in La j olla, Pacific 
Beach, Clairemont, U niversity 
City, Mission Bay, Mira Mesa and 
the Gaslamp District. The service 
takes undergraduate students home

if they live on campus or close to 
campus. 

Muir senior Patricia Vidal sa id 
that the A.S. Council should "defi-
nitely" run the service on 
Halloween. 

"I live off campus," Vidal said. 
"But [the service) only goes one 
way, so I'm stranded." 

Warren junior Eric Evenskaas 
said that the council's decision to 
run the service on Halloween is 
"great." 

"I imagine a lot of people will be 
drinking that night," Evenskaas 
said. 

The A.S. Council contracts the 
service out to Cloud 9 Shuttle, Inc. 
It costs the A.S. Council $70 for 
each van used in a two-hour time

BRIEFLY 
ueop study says S.A.T. II better predictor than S.A.T. I 

A study conducted by the uc Office of the 
President released Oct. 25 concluded that scores on 
the SAT. 1/ achievement tests are better predictors 
of academic success in college than scores on the 
SAT. I reasoning test. Also, the study shOwed that 
SAT. II scores are less affected by differences in 
socioeconomic backgrounds. 

The study examined the relationship between 
test scores and academic outcomes of 7B,ooo first-
time freshmen who entered the UC system over a 
four-year period. 

The University of California has required fresh-
man applicants to submit both SAT. I and SAT. II 
scores since 196B. The study utilized the University 
of Califomia's extensive database on the two tests. 

UC President Richard C Atkinson proposed to the 
University of Califomia's Academic Senate that the 
SAT. I scores no longer be required for freshman 
admission. His proposal is under review by the Senate, 
which is a representative body of the UC faculty. 

No changes will be implemented for students 
applying for fall 2002 admission.

Northridge in early November. 

UCSD researcher gets grant 
to study manic depression 

UCSD School of Medicine associate professor of 
psychiatry William Perry received an Independent 
Investigator grant from the National Alliance for 
Research on Schizophrenia and Depression. 

The project that won him the grant was titled 
'Gating Deficits in Bipolar Manic Patients With and 
Without Psychosis.' 

NARSAD is the largest donor-supported organi-

zation worldwide funding research of brain disor-
ders. The Independent Investigator Program sup-
ports scientists at the point between initiating inde-
pendent research and achieving sustained funding. 

The two-year award of $94,712 will fund Perry's 
studies of sensorimotor gating problems, which may 
account for the overwhelming input of stimuli that 
many bipolar patients are unable to filter. 

Marine bacteria may be 
source of anti-cancer drug 

Researchers at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography found further evidence that bacteria 
living inside a small marine animal may be the 
source of a new drug compound, Bryostatin I, being 
developed to fight cancer. 

Margo Haygood, Seana Davidson, Scott Allen, 
Grace Lim and Christine Anderson, all of 510, co-
authored the paper, which appeared in October's 
Applied of!d Environmental Microbiology. 

HaygoOd was the senior author of the paper. 
She and her co-authors identified a gene of the 

type that produces the compound thought to have 
the ability to treat a variety of cancers. 

The anti-<:ancer element is found in bacteria liv-
ing in the marine invertebrate Bugula neritina, a 
brown bryozoan animal that looks like algae. 
Bryozoans are widely known by boat operators who 
often scrape them off their vessels' hulls. 

Haygood is conducting further research, which 
addresses two areas: the cultivation of the bacteria 
outside the Bugula neritina and the doning of the 
genes that make the drug. • 

.CaIBio~arine Technologies, Inc. of Carlsbad, 
Calif., has Signed an agreement with UCSD to com-
mercialize Haygood's findings for the eventual c0m-
mercial supply of bryostatin.

A.S. Council passes 
anti ... hate resolution 
Specific steps for accurate 
reporting of hate crimes suggested 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council passed a res-
olution on hate crimes at its Oct. 
H meeting. 

E leanor Rooseve lt College 
Sopho more Senator Tom 
Chapman wrote the resoluti on. 
He said he feels that hate crimes 
need to be reported more often 
and monitored more closely at 
UCSD and other UC campu es. 

"UCSD's police have said one 
hate crime happened last year, the 

norney General of California 
sa id that four hate crimes hap-
pened last year and University of 
California police said six hate 
crimes and six hate incidents were 
reported last year," Cha pman 
said . "Obviously, there is a dis-
crepancy in their reports." 

The resolution calls for hiring 
someone to ensure that hate 
crimes would not be under-report-
ed or ignored due to ambiguity in 
what constitutes a hate crime. 

Chapman is concerned that 
the UCSD police may not be 
accounting for all hate crimes that 
occur on campus. 

"The UCSD police seem to be 
under- reporting hate crimes on 
ou r campus," he said. "UCSD 
police do not report 'Hate Bias, 
Vandalism or Intimidation,' 
which make up 60 percent of 
California's hate crimes." 

The resolution states that hate 
crimes are inconsistent with the 
UCSD Principles of Community 

and therefore the UCSD student 
body and the A.S. Council ~hould 
not allow them to occur. 

The CSD PrinCiples of 
COlllmuniry states "\ Ve rClect ;JCh 
of discrlll11'natlon bJscd on r.ICC , 
ethmcity, gender, age, thsabdlt)" 
sexual o nentatJon, religlOn, ~IHI 
political beliefs, and, we will con-
front and appropriately respond 
to such acts." 

The A.S. Council passed a res-
olu tion earlier this )'ear in 
response the Sept. 1'1 terrori sl 
attacks , in which they resolved to 
promote a hate-free campus Jild 
to work to uphold the UCSD 
Principles of Community. 

This resolution offers a pr JCli-
cal response to that resolution, 
call ing for specific action against 
hate crimes. 

"We felt like it was important 
that we make a statement directly 
in response to hate crimes and 
hate speech," said A.S. Presidclll 
jeff D odge. 

Dodge emphasized the impor-
tance of taking speci fic measure 
aga inst hate crimes and hale 
speech at UCSD . 

"This is something that our 
council would have taken a stance 
on regardless [of what happened 
Sept. 1 I ]." Dodge said. 

Dodge said that hate crimes 
had taken place at UCSD long 
before Sept. 11 and the hate 
crimes that followed Sept. 1 1 
allowed the council to put greater 
emphasis on the importance of a 
hate- free campus.

Far from detracting from the proverbial 'melting pot,' UCSD's ethnicity-based 
student organizations provide much-needed support through commonality 
By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

When I first transferred from a 
junior college to this essentially 
homogenous university, I was apa-
thetic to student organizations. A 
year later, I am wri ti ng for the 
Guardian and I am a member of the 
African American Student Union 
and the Women of Color 
Conference Committee. I went 
from disinterested to hyperin-
volved in the span of a year. 

I believe that students who try 
to involve themselves in campus 
life, especially in race-based organi-
7..1tions, are doing exactly what it 
takes to get the most out of their 
college experience. 

Ethnicity-based organizations 
provide an artery for diversity to 
flow through UCSD. To eliminate 
such clubs would mean the death of 
what limited diversity UCSD now 
has. 

A recent conversation with a fel-
low student forced me to evaluate 
why I believe these groups are a 
necessity. 

"Why are you in AASU?" asked 
Nathan, a Caucasian friend, without 
a hint of sarcasm. "Why does there 
need to be an AASU anyway?" 

\lVe engaged in a heated discus-
sion about the need for ethnicity-
based student organizations. 
Nathan adamantly argued that if 
people in the United States hope to 
eliminate racial barriers and inter-
mingle successfully with one anoth-
er, we are obliged to eliminate 
exclusive groups and move toward 
cross-cultural unification. 

Nathan had a valid point. But 
then I looked around campus and I 
thought of 56 good reasons why 
AASU and other student organiza-
tions like it are necessary. 

Fifty-six new African-American 
sntdents enrolled at UCSD for the 
2001 school year. This includes 

transfer and freshman sntdents. 
UCSD's total undergraduate 

enrollment is 21,568. This means 
that 0.2 percent of the undergradu-
ate population is represented by 
new black faces. 

Do we need AASU? Absolutely. 
Ethnic-based 'organizations are 

a campus necessity that should be 
designed, at least in part, to fight 
the causes that are specific to a par-
ticular race. But in addition to that, 
these groups provide their mem-
bers with an outlet independent of 
academics, and a system of friend-
ship found scarcely anywhere else 
at UCSD. 

First, ethnicity-based groups 
serve as a forum for political 
activists to champion the views and 
address the concerns of groups 
marginalired by society. 

I do not feel that white people 
cannot or should not be involved in 
causes afflicting other ethnic 
groups or that, say, Chicanos 

should not picket on behalf of the 
Filipino population. 

I am, however, saying that social 
movements are more passionately 
driven by members directly affect-
ed by their outcome. The assis-
tance of every race makes social 
movements more effective. But, for 
example, the Chicano members of 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanola 
de Aztlan would probably be the 
most forceful in organizing a move-
ment on behalf of Latino janitors. 

Similarly, members of AASU 
would probably be more fervent 
than a group of white students 
when arguing for black admission 
and retention rates at UCSD. 

The commonality shared 
among members of ethnic groups is 
often a defining characteristic of 
many of the members' lives. When 
they fight for causes that pertain 
specifically to them, the dynamic of 
group power is amplified. 

Another reason to promote eth-

nie-specific organizations is the 
camaraderie and sense of family 
that such groups foster. 

Look around UCSD. You see 
faces furrowed in deep thought -
most likely contemplating the elu-
sive answer to an equation. You see 
people on Fridays,-hurriedly head-
ing toward a shuttle or ttying to 
beat rush hour traffic for their 
commute home. 

What you don't hear is people 
eagerly talking about the tailgate 
party for the Friday night football 
game. You won't regularly hear 
people chatting about Greek hous-
es at which they are going to make 
their weekend rounds. 

UCSD has a fragmented, antiso-
cial aonosphere. I may be a little 
biased, as a transfer student who was 
forced to live off campus my first 
year, but in general, social life -
well, the lack thereof - is a serious

Execute job hunt without prejudice 
Unemployment statistics need not be discouraging 
By WILSON CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

If you are a tech-oriented 
upperclassman in college who is 
thinking about 3 ca reer, or if you 
are a recent graduate sti ll hanging 
around school because you cannot 
find a job, then this article is writ-
ten with you in mind. 

Before I go any further, I 
would like to present some statis-
tics. I may not be a math person , 
and you might be bored by this 
proposition, but statistics go far in 
ass isting the prognosis and analy-
sis of a problem. So let 's check out 
some unemployment statistics. 

According to Tht San Ditgo 
U7lion- Tribllllt, local unemploy-
ment was around 3.3 percent in 
June. By Jul y, that had not 
changed. Even after the Sept. II 
attacks, unemployment in San 
Diego was around 3.4 percent. 

At this point, that sounds pret-
ty ridiculous. The national unem-
ployment rate is higher: 4.9 per-
cent. Sntdies even show that peo-
ple will take less pay just to live in 

an Diego.

Ethnicity-based groups bring 
people together in a way that elic-
its feelings - not only of friend-
ship, but of family. On this cam-
pus, that is very difficult to attain.

article, writer Marc Bailon gave an 
example that may forecast rough 
times ahead. 

A new Red Robin Gourmet 
Burgers restaurant owner in 
Portland, Ore., collected more than 
1,700 job applications. The owner, 
James Bastidas, said that college

graduates stood in long lines with 
laid-off factory workers for only 
165 openings, each offering pay of 
between $6.50 and $9.50 per hour. 
Bastidas said it "blew him away." 

Terrorism - and the fear that is 
rampant as a result of the Sept. 11 
attacks and the anthrax incidents-
is further hurting what was already 
a deterio~ting economy. 

AASU has afforded me the oppor-
ntnity to see faces - smiling faces, 
at that - of people who look like 
me, sound like me and have 
endured similar experiences. That 
we share such an integral com-
monality eliminates a lot of the 
preliminaries that precede the 
development of most friendships. 

On that note, the Greek system 
also provides similar opportuniti es 
conducive to the bonding of stu-
dents who identify ethnicaJJy with 
one another. While I suppon stu-

But that brings me to my main 
point: People cannot just keep 
complaining about not having a 
job and that finding one is so dif-
ficult. I am sick of hearing that. 

There is no point in saving 
your dignity, my friends and fel -
low students. The Red Robin case 
was one of many that Bailon 
pointed out. Other restaurants 
and retail shops are experiencing 
the same thing. If all those people 
can suck it up and take lower pay 
in the meantime, so can you.

Cisco is laying off 8,000 
employees. SUN Microsystems 
ju t slas hed 4,000 people from its 
workforce. Agilent, Lucent and 
other tech companies are cutting 
jobs, too. 

I know that many UCSD com-
puter science and engineering stu-
dents long for those jobs. And I 
know Alan Greenspan has said 
that the entire country will be hit 
hard with decline. 

How can I be so unmerciful

differences between race-related

These differences lead me to the 
conclusion that race-based sntdel1t 
organizations are superior even to 
their Greek counterparts.

Editor: 
While Matthew E. Crow's arti-

cle ("Christianity misunderstood 
by detractors and faithful alike, " 
Oct. 25) insinuates that Christians 
and non-Christians alike are igno-
rant of one genuine interpretation 
of Christianity, the reality is that 
there are as many valid views as 
there are people. 

Though I'm an atheist, I know 
better than to stereotype 
Christians. I was raised a Catholic, 
yet most of my family supports 
abortion, homosexuality and birth 
control. I have a firsthand under-
standing that not all Christians are 
bigoted, blind adherents to their 
denominations. 

Crow says that people misun-
derstand Christianity because of 
the "injustices" it has inherited. I 
assume by this .he means such acts 
as the Crusades, the Inquisition, 
European imperialism and the his-

OPINION 5 

torical condemnation of progres-
sives, from Galileo to homosexuals. 

Crow suggests that Christianity 
should be judged onJ esus' message 
and not on the hypocritica l actions 
of some Christians. Yct how else 
arc we to judge Christianity? 

If we accept that religions exist 
for the purpose of social condition-
ing, then wc must acknowledge 
that Christianity has largely failed 
at instilli ng 11110 Its followers the 
very morals that C row cbims Jcsus 
supportt!d . The negative actiun; of 
Christians reflect back on 
Christianity, and so its "injustices" 
aren't inherited - they're earned. 
A bumper sticker reads: "God, save 
me from your fo ll owers!" 

The Christian faith is not 
defi ned exclusively by the teach-
ings of Jesus. If it were, there 
would be no Old lestamenl. The 
sad truth is that the Bible is so opcn 
to interpretation, anyone can find 
just about whatever message he 
seeks. 

Econonust Ludwig von Mises 
wrote tha t "each epoch has found 
in the Gospels what it sought to 
find there, und has overlooked what 
it wished to overlook." Though 
Crow wishes to find in Chn tianity 
a spirit of love and compassIon, he 
cannot nullify other views because 
they a ~e contrary to his. 

Jerry Falwell and the Westboro 
Baptist Church, with its slogan "God 
hates fags," arc biblically justified in 
thei r disdain. Leviticus 18:22 says in 
no uncertain terms that homosexual-
ity is wmng. It is fine if Crow dis-
agrees, but he must recognize that 
the c Christians do not misundcr-
stand their own religion. 

The blame for this biblical dissent 
fal ls squarely on the Bible itself. If it 
were not so unorganized and poorly 
wrinen, there would not be so much 
argument about its meaning. 

The true paradox of modern 
Christianity is not that the leaders of

Right to free 
speech challenged 
at universities 
After Sept. 11 attacks, individuals 
nationwide say they have been 
denied First Amendment rights 

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 
Universities, once free to engage 
in public debate, are finding this 
tradition tested in the wake of the 
Sept. II attacks on New York and 
Washington, D.C. 

Across the nation, college fac-
ulty and staff who expressed opin-
ions on the terrorist attacks and 
U.S. involvement in Mghanisun 
faced censorship issues that led to 
suspension and investigation. 

UCLA suspended library 
assistant Jonnie Hargis without 
pay for five days after he criti-
cized U.S. support for Israel in an 
e-mail. Hargis sent the e-mail on 
the school's computers in 
response. to a co-worker's mass e-
mail in praise of America. 

in Education, said these incidents 
highlight an erosion of free acad-
emic expression that existed 
before Sept. 11. 

The Philadelphia-based orga-
nization finds free legal help for 
faculty who feel a university 
infringed upon their First 
Amendment rights. 

A University of Alabama phi-
losophy professor, Norvin 
Richards, pointed out that some 
criticize dissenting views as unpa-
triotic.

"This offends me," he said. 
"Who decides what's politically 
corre<;t? I'd like to see us pass 
something that supports free 
speech." 

The resolution asks all UCSD 
organizations to "maintain an 
appropriate level of dignity, toler-
ance and peace. II 

It also denounces using any 
speech that "compromises the 
principles of freedom and commu-
nity adhered to both on the UCSD

"We had seen the Marshall res-

opposed to what we think of Thr 
Koala or any other campus organi-
zation in particular." 

RCC is the second college 
council to pass a resolution in 
response to Thr Koala controversy; 
TMCSC was the first. 

Muir College Council "does 
not have any plans to pass a reso-
lution condemning Thr Koala," 
said MCC Chair Elizabeth Erwin. 

"As individual students we 

students must sign a waiver and affix 
a Triton Taxi sticker to their UCSD

Waivers and stickers are available

An MCC subcolllmittee wrotc a

Muir Junior Senator Nick 
Lieberknecht. 

TMCSC's Chair Adam Sharki 
defended his council's resolution. 

"I stand by TMCSC's actions 
100 percent," he said . .. ur 
response was appropriate in acting 
on behalf of our constituents and 
our philosophy." 

Sharki emphasized that 
TMCSC supports free speech and 
that the resolution was not an 
attempt to si lence Tlu Koala. 

"While Tlu Koala is a forum for 
[its contributors] to express lheir 
views, the resolution passed by 
TMCSC was a forum for [offended 
students] to express their views,"

The service was established by 
the A.S. Council's Office of 
Services and Enterprises to pro-
vide UCSD students a safe way 
home from uncomfortable situa-
tions. 

Service was recently expanded 
to serve the Gaslamp District. 

The day the university penal-
ized Hargis, the St2ff also suted 
that library policy forbids using 
its e-mail to send unsolicited 
poli tical or patriotic messages. 
However, Hargis said he was the 
only one punished. . 

In a similar incident, the 
University of South Florida placed 
professor Sarni AI-Arian on indefi-
nite paid leave for his safety. 
University officials acted after 
receiving a death threat and angry 
calls following AI-Arian's appear-
ance on a television news program 
in which he was asked about his 
ties to fwo suspected terrorists. 

"The essence of patriotism is 
loyalty to the nation's most fun-
damenul values and a willingness 
to help it do right by these values 
even at cost to oneself," Richards 
said. "If so, it is not unpatriotic 
for a citizen of our nation to 
speak his or her piece at times 
like these, especially if he or she 
'believes the nation is following 
the wrong course. It is patriotic." 

He also said some people 
think it is improper for state uni-
versities to permit dissenting 
views on the grounds that they 
are tax-supported and they feel 

Rolling Stones 

AI-Arian said he only knew the 
men as academics and that their 
later links to terrorism shocked 
him. AI-Arian also founded a now-
defunct think tank on Middle East ' 
issues. The FBI investigated the 
group, but AI-Arian has not been 
arrested or charged. 

Also, a University of New 
Mexico history professor, Richard 
Berthold, agreed to leave campus 
for a week due to violent threats 

, ;Uter he told a Western civi lization 
class, "Anyone who can blow up 
the Pentagon has my vote." 

• taxpayers should not have to pay 
for the expression of views they 
consider "downright treasonous." 

"Universities should be places 
where we have the opportunity to 
reason and stimulation to do so, 

. not places where that is cut off," 
Richards said. 

Richards also acknowledged 
the belief that those who speak 
out are damaging the war effort 
by undercutting the morale of 
soldiers the nation sends to fight. 

"This assumes the dissenters 
are wrong and the prevailing view 
is correct. It also assumes that 
soldiers cannot carry out their 
tasks unless there is no question-
ing of their cause and no question 
but that their ca use is just," 
Richards said. 

"I was a jerk," Berthold said. 
"The U.S. Constitution's guaran-
tee of free speech protects my 
right to be a jerk." 

Thor Halvorssen, head of the 
Foundation for Individual Rights 

Richards believes these criti-
cisms fall short of showing that 
speech should be censored at uni-
versities.

10 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Haunted San Diego offers thrills and chills 
Encounters with the paranormal are close to home 
By SHARON SHAPIRO 
Staff Writer 

1 r },Oll ever hear strange noises 
when you're alone or have ever fe lt 
a cold breeze when nearby win-
dows and doors are shut, you 
might not be alone. 

Step in ide the history of San 
Diego and you will soon discover 
that our city is host to its .own 
pa ranormal activity. 

Psychics and parapsychologists 
have nocked to numerous sites in 
downtown San Diego, document-
ing enough spooky appearances 
and disturbances to scare even the 
most level -headed person. 

Visitors to such sites cla im to 
hea r strange sounds, wh ile others 
experience bizarre sensations that 
they attribute to alleged supernat-
ural activity. 

Whether or not you believe in 
ghosts or the pa ranormal, check 
o ut some of the fo llowing attrac-
tions this H alloween. T hey might 
JUSt send chill s down your spine. 

The Whaley House 
Located in O ld Town, the 

Wha ley H o use is by far San 
Diego's spookiest attraction. Built 
in the 19th century, thi s Victorian-
style house was once San Diego 
County's seat of government, and 
it has a creepy history. 

In the second half of the 19th 
ccnmry, a man named " Ya nkee" 
J tm Robmson was accused, under 
conl1icting reports, of stealing a 
I.! rgc boar. Although he attempted 
to elude the police, he was quickly 
caught by a civilian who took the 
liberty of whacking him over the 
head before officials threw him in 
jai l. 

Robinson received a tri al, but 
was probably only semi-conscious 
during thc proceedings d ue to his 
he.ld in jury. T he court found him 
gu tl ty tI1 no rime and ordered him 
hanged. I lowever, due to a calcu-

CouI1ItSy of ~ Del CoIonIdo 
Apparition: Ghosts, such as one purportedly photographed here, are said to 
haunt local historical buildings. 
lation error, Robinson did not die 
immediately. His feet touched the 
ground and he suffered a long, 
painful death. 

It is believed that Robinson's 
spirit still lurles in the house. 
Visitors report hearing sounds of 
heavy footsteps upstairs and recall 
feel ing strangled while passing 
through the archway whece 
Robinson was killed. 

Also, the house's original own-
ers, T homas and Anna Whaley, 
thei r daughter and one of her 
ch ildhood friends are said to 
remain on the property - in spir-
it, at least. The smell of Thomas' 
cigars and Anna's lavender per-
fume linger in the rooms, and the 
children's laughter can be heard. 

Even Regis Philbin, who spent 
the night at the house in 1964, left 
in a bit o f a nervous panic after 
seeing an apparition at 2:30 a.m. 

The Whaley House is located at 
2482 San Diego Ave. It is a museum 
in the Old Town San Diego State 

Historic State Park and is open 
every day except Tuesday from 10 
a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Admission is $4. 
For more information call (619) 
297-7511. 

La Cas a de Bandini 
Also located in Old Town is La 

Casa de Bandini, a beautiful adobe 
hacienda built in 1829 for Juan 
Bandini and his family. In 1850, it 
was converted into a hotel and it is 
now a Mexican restaurant. 

Unfortunately, dinner out may 
be more than you bargained for. 

Some claim that a female ghost 
in a long dress who glides along 
the balcony and through sealed 
doors is a permanent resident. 
Reports also allege that lights will 
turn on and off by themselves. 
Others hear footsteps on the 
wooden floor upstairs. 

Casa de Bandini's address is 
2660 Calhoun St. and the phone 
number is (619) 297-8211. The 
restaurant opens at 11 a.m. 

Monday through Saturday and 10 
a.m. Sundays. 

Hotel Del Coronado 
This gorgeous hotel is not 

exempt from its own mysterious 
events and paranormal activity. 

K2te Morgan, a. visitor at the 
hotel around the turn of the centu-
ry, died here. The circumstances 
surrounding her death were never 
completely put to rest, leaving 
others to speculate about murder 
or suicide. 

There are two rooms that are 
believed to be haunted: 3312 and 
3502 . One supposedly contains 
Morgan's soul, and the other con-
tains the soul of a hotel maid who 
also died under mysterious cir-
cumstances. 

The Del is hard to miss if 
you're in Coronado. Its address is 
1500 Orange Ave. and it can be 
reached at (800) Houl-Dtl. 

La Casa de Estudillo 
This adobe house in Old Town 

was built in 1829 for Captain Jose 
Maria de Estudillo. In 1910, the 
house was restored to feature a 
functioning kitchen and furnished 
rooms. Although La Casa de 
Estudillo is beautiful, it is also 
spooky and its history is tainted 
with unexplained incidents. 

Visitors report feeling sudden 
cold spots in certain rooms and 
hearing faint sounds of prayer. 
There are also reports that a young 
Victorian girl wills a rcx.!Ong chair to 
sway back and forth in a bedroom. 

La Casa de Estudillo is located 
on Mason Street in Old Town and is 
open from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. daily 
and is free of charge. 

Whether you're a believer or 
you think these reports of tlle 
paranormal are all bunk, head out 
this week and check it all out for 
yourself. It just might make your 
Halloween that much spookier. 

IDracula' will seduce theatergoers 
La Jolla Playhouse will host nights of living undead 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Senior Staff Wri ter 

Tired o f the sa me old 
l lallowccn entertai nment tarring 
J amie Lee C urti , N cve C ampbell 
o r - worse yet - Jennifer Love 
H ewi tt) If so, La Jolla Playhouse 'S 
production of "D racula : T he 
Musical " is an alternative for a 
good th rill. 

G hosts, monsters and va mpires 
have lurked in H alloween lore 
through the ages. Whether it has 
been in films or booles, the undead 
have always been fasci nating. 

"Dracula: T he Musical ," based 
on Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel 
" Dracula ," chronicles the mysteri -
o us life of Transylvania 's most infa-
m ous resi dent. When attorney 
J onathan H arker visits Dracula 's 
home about a property transaction, 
Dracula is revitalized. When he 
sees a picture of Harker's fiancee, 
Mina Murray, Dracula feels that 
Mina could be the woman that he 
lost many centuries earlier. 

The plot th ickens as Dracu la 
travels to Victorian-era London to 
seek his long-lost bride. While 
there, Dracula encounters vam-
pire-hunter and professor 
Abraham Van He1sing as well as 
M ina's best fri end , Lucy Westenra. 
T rouble ensues as Dracula seduces 
Lucy and turns her into a vampire, 
prompti ng Van Helsing and others 

to hunt down Dracula and kill him. 
"Dracu la: T he Musical" is a 

production full of romance and 
lust, in addition to the supernamr-
ai , mystery and suspense of any 
good horror fl ick. 

Adapting "Dracula " from a lit-
erary work to the stage is a chal-
lenge, but the crew of the musical 
is full of veterans of the theater 
business. The music was written 
by Frank Wildhorn ("The Scarlet 
Pimpernel," "Jekyll and H yde") 
and the lyrics were created by Don 
Black ("Sunset Boulevard") and 
Christopher Hampton ("Sunset 
Boulevard," "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses"). 

Under the direction of Des 
McAnuff ("The Whos 'Tommy,'" 
"How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Tryingj, "Dracula: 
The Musical" is a technically com-
plex production. Stagehands are 
practically nonexistent because vir-
tually all the sets are brought onto 
the stage by machines and 
hydraulics. Surprises abound as 
props appear out of thin air and spe-
cial effects are usedheavily. The 
design of the set alone is worth the 
price of admission. 

"Dracula: The Musical" is a 
Broadway-level production that is 
not often seen on many campuses. 

The musical score has a haunt-
ed, detached feel to it, embodying 
the feelings of Dracula. McAnuff is 

CourtIIr ~ ~ JDfII ..... 
81ooc1-suddnc: Dracula, played by Tom Hewitt. WOIks his spell on Lucy, played 
by Am{ Rutberg. 
very excited with the score. 

"The music is quite different 
than Frank Wildhorn's other 
scores" he said. "It has more of a 
classical feel, less pop and more 
mesmeric and haunted and 
unworldly I find his melodies for 
'Dracula' truly arresting and, 
needless to say, I hope the rest of 
the world agrees." 

"Dracula: The Musical" is defi-
nitely more refined and thrilling 
than your standard B-movie. If 

you are looking for a truly haunt-
ing alternative for getting your 
Halloween spooks this week, 
"Dracula: The Musical" might be 
just what you are looking for. 

"Dracula: The Musical" is the 
last production of the La Jolla 
Playhouse's 2001 season and con-
tinues from now until Nov. 25 at 
the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 
TIckets can be purchased online at

Costumes 
at the last 
minute can 
be easy 
Supplies often 
already at home 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's that time of year again. 
People around the nation are drop-
ping insane amounts of money on 
extravagant costumes to impress 
the masses. And then there's you: a 
broke college student with 
absolutely no money to spend on a 
costume. With that in mind, here 
are a few quick, easy and, best of all, 
cheap suggestions for costumes 
that are sure to get a glance or two. 

The first costume is "Duct Tape 
Man." The construction of this 
costume requires five to six rolls of 
duct tape and one paper plate. 

First, dress in pants and a long-
sleeve shirt - you'll see why in a 
second. Next, cover yourself in 
duct tape. That's right, just wrap it 
around your body until you are 
covered in duct tape from the neck 
down. Malee yourself a cape lSf 
attaching several long strands of 
duct tape together and putting it on 
your bacle_ 

To finish the costume off, use 
the duct tape to attach the paper 
plate to your chest. Then fashion a 
niee "DTM" on the plate to let 
everyone know that you are, in fact, 
"Duct Tape Man." 

The next costume is an oldie but 
goodie: the shower. For this cos-
rume you will need a shower cur-
tain with rings, some rounded PVC 
pipe, straight PVC pipe and some 
duct tape. 

Simply fashion a ring out of 
PVC pipe and attach the shower 
rings and curtain. Take two pieces 
of straight pipe and attach them to 
the round pipe, angling down . 
They will attach to two pieces of 
rounded pipe that will be on your 
shoulders. Then duct tape them 
into place and you have your very 
own shower - perfect for dancing 
close with that special someone. 

The next costume requires a lot 
of guts to wear. You can call it 
futuristic garb. This costume 
requires clear plastic wrap, colored 
plastic wrap and a colored thong 
that matches the color of your 
plastic wrap. Women can add a 
skimpy bra that matches the color 
of plastic wrap, but this is strictly 
optional. 

To construct this cosrume, sim-
ply put on your undergarments and 
wrap around the naughty areas of 
your body several rimes with the 
colored plastic wrap. Wrap the rest 
of your body in the clear wrap. You 
should bring the clear plastic wrap 
to the party and invite others to join 
you in your ultra-futuristic attire. 

Finally, there is the laundry bas-
ket. For this costume, you will deed 
one rectangular laundry basket 
(fairly large), some string and a lot 
of laundry (preferably underwear). 

For this costume, cut out the 
bottom of the laundry basket and 
p~t your legs through. Attach the 
string to the baslcet and use it as 
suspenders to hold the basket up 
around your legs. Then drape 
laundry over yourself. Depending 
on how brave you are - and how 
expertly you drape the laundry 
over yourself - you do not need to 
wear underwear with this costume. 

These are just a few suggestions 
to keep this holiday enjoyable, yet 
affordable at the Slme time. It's a 
pretty safe bet that these costumes 
will be unique this Halloween and 
will get a lot of attention.

WE'RE LOOKING FOR 1WINS FOR A STUDY AT UCSD! 

UCSD researchers would like to meet people who are twins for a brief 
study on how heredity influences blood pressure in healthy persons. Because 
IWlns share genes, twin pairs allow us to evaluate readily how heritability 
Influences traits. We see both identical ("monozygotic") and fratemal 
("dizygotic") IWin pairs. We seek twins of either sex, 18 years of age or 
older, and all ethnic groups or races. 

The study takes about 40 minutes and includes measurement of blood 
pressure and heart rate, as well as taking blood and urine sample. We will 
provide monetary compensation for your lime and travel. 

If you and your twin would like to find out more about this study, please 
contact Lily Rao a\: (858) 552-8585, extension 6158; fax: (858) 641-6331 ;

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Conservative views silenced 
in face of opposition 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Managing Editor 

Every Monday, after our weekly 
staff meeting, the GUlJrdioll editorial 
board chooses a topic it ca res to 
express an opinion about, settles on a 
smnce by vote and writes an editori -
al dlat appears on the Opinion page 
of the T hursday issue. Are you fasci-
nated yet' Wait, tllcre' more. 

Regardless of who votes in favor 
of the stance and who vores against 
it, all of the board's names appear 
above the editorial. 

This pa t issue, we rook a stance 
on California Assembly Bill 25, 
supporting its passage on the 
groupds that unmarried couples 
should have the same rights as mar-
ried people and that a bill of its 
nanlre is long overdue. 

Ilowe,"er, 1 was the odd man -
or rather, woman - out this week. 1 
do not support the bill. This doesn't 
really bother me tOO much, seeing as 
sir1ce I disagreed, I would nor have to 
write the 400 word article. Witll two 
midterms and four papers, 1 didn't 
have time to write it anyway. 

Usually, if a topic relating to 
social issues or politics is brought 
before the board, there is a very real 
possibility that I will disagree witll 
some or all of the rest of my col-
leagues on one or more aspects of . 
the issue. I hold conservative (,"cry 
conservative, I'm told) vielVs dlat I've 
noticed are very unpopular on a col-
lege campus - and I'm talking 
about UCSD here, not Berkeley. 

On the Gllordall, it's OK that I 
disagree with the people I sit on the 
editorial board with. They are also 
my friends and there are no hard 
feelings if they end up publicly sup-
porting something I don 't. 

It is even OK with me if my 
name also appears on the article. 
They are mature, intelligent people 
and there is mutual respect among 
us. 

In other arenas, however, I've 
come to feel it is not all right. Yes, 1 
hold conservative views with which 
many people I've met do not agree 
and yes, I am even (gaspl) pro-life. 
In fact, it is the aspect of my con-
servative views that I am most 
vehement about. 

I haven't always been this opin-
ionated: JUSt last year I quit ed-
board because I didn't have much to 
say. However, I've found that c?l-

lege is a highly politicized environ-
ment. Those who don't espouse 
political opinions soon find some, 
and college campuses, even this one, 
are prime targets for candida tes or 
visibly partisan persons come elec-
tion time, and even all year long. 

Due to this and to just getting 
older, I have a little more to say 
now. vVhile I've seen that in public 
political events on this campus, 
bodl sides (and every point of view 
in between, for that matter) get 
represented, it still seems that when 
it comes to any tiling even remotely 
political, everyone is again t me, 
and vocally at that. In some cases, 
being conservative, or more specif-
ica lly in my case, being pro-life, is 
akin to committing a crime of the 
most serious nature. 

For exa mpl e, last yea r, the 
esteemed women's rights advocate 
and co-founder of Ms. magazine 
Gloria Steinem visi ted our cam-
pus in support of the Democratic 
party. She spoke in the Price 

It seems that when it 
comes to anything 

even remotely political, 
everyone is against me, 

and vocally at that. 

Center Plaza about why college, 
students should vote Democrat: 
bec,lUse the party was friendlier 
regarding issues about women's 
bodies and women' rights than 
other parties. She mean t, of 
course, the Republicans, who as 
we all know want ro take away a 
woman's right to choose just ro 
make her life unbearable, right' 

I'm sure that lurking in the 
shadow of little Gloria at her big 
podium were people who, like 
myself, held conservative views and 
were maybe even pro-life, too. 

But unlike them, I, being a mem-
ber of the college press, was invited 
by Gloria's handlers to ride on her 
bus to the next stop on her tour, San 
Diego State University. 1 had been 
having conversations with the event 
organizers and they knew that I had 
only come to see Gloria speak 
because I respected her as a forerun-
ner of the women's movement and 
because she was quite accomplished 
in my field, journalism. 

SPOTLIGHT 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2001 

My invitation was extended with 
one stipulation: that 1 not say 
anything about being pro-life. 

"Fine by me; whatever," 1 
thought. But the more I've' thought 
about it, and I think about it 
surprisingly onen, it i~ disconcerting 
that merely voicing a differing OPIl1-
ion in her presence would have been 
some sort of capital offense upon 
which 1 would be immediately 
expelled from the bus, wl1ich, they 
had told me is what would happen. 
Believe me, even though I feci dif-
ferently about the issue than her, J 
wa n't ready to argue with loria 
Steinem about abortion, and it's not 
JUSt becau e she's famous. 

J thought Democrats were 
supposedly better because they are 
more liberal and tlllIS morc respect-
ing of a variety of views. Ilnun. 

1 will make one concession, 
though . I think some of this back-
lash aga inst pro-lifers is warranted. 
While it's not individually their 
fault, they have been given a bad 
reputation by those people who 
stand on the side of busy strects 
with ca rdboa rd sign depicting 
newly aborted fenlses. 

1 haven 't always been this opin-
ionatcd, and I'm not going to go into 
demi l about how [ feel on every sub-
ject and why, but suffice it to say that 
J have become more politici7.cd in 
the last couple of years, having been 
tought in college to see thinb'S in an 
incresingly critical light. 

If a subject comes up, I'll tell you 
where I stand on it becau e I don't 
think that it's fair that I should have 
to hide my views just because they 
are uncommon for my age group or 
because you disagree with me. 

I also want you to know that I 
am not going to hove my views 
down your rhroat._ If we ge t into a 
debate, I'm not going to mindlessly 
say that abortion is murder or that 
anyone who thinks otherwise is a 
murderer. 1 won't defend my posi-
tion by quoting passages from the 
Bible. If 1 manage to convince an 
ed-board some day that I am right 
on the issue, this is the only way my 
views will ever be shoved down 
your throat, I promise. 

But I do think that if you're ever 
famous and I'm invited on your bus 
and your handlers ask me politely 
to please not mention a differing 
view than yours, 1 think I'll decline 
the ride.

Activism: 
Both sides promote 
student involvement 
Continued from page 9 

"There's not very much dis-
cussion," she said about the war 
while slretching out on the grass. 
"That's really disappointed me." 

"TAs and professors haven't 
talked about it much," she noted. 
"I understand there's a set syl-
labus, but it's not every day that 
our country's involved in a war. 
It's kind of disappointing - it's 
really disappointing." 

Muir junior Andrew 
DeCaminada explained why he 
felt student involvement and 
awareness are important. 

"I think if there is a lot of 
Ilnvolvement]. it could make a Qig 
difference." he said, "but if it's just 
lime groups all over the place, we 
won't make much difierence." 

Maas pointed Out, "Being at a 
university, there are a lot of stu-
dents who will end up in a posi-
non of power ... what happens 
today is goi ng to affect every-
thing in the future ." 

Maas, like the members of 
lhe ISO, is firmly opposed to the 
war in Afghanistan. 
DeCaminada, however, attended 
the rally to learn more and 
hoped other students would 
adopt a similarly open-minded 
attitude. 

"\ Vhether they agree with the 
war or not, it's just a matter of 
forming an opinion and taking a 
stance" he said. 

When the speakers finished, 
the rally became a march, and 
attendees formed a long block, 
moving down the Prado into 
the park. ome chanted "One, 
twO, three, four - break the 
~dence, srop the violence," or, 
";-.Jot Illy president, not my war 
- we're fired up and won't take 
It anymore." Some of the loud-
e t voices were those of the stu-
dents. 

Vince Vasquez is a Revelle 
senior. 

He is president of the 
Conservative Union, an active 
member of the College 
Republicans and a contributor to 
lhe Cnltfol7l1a RWlrw. 

I Ie describes himself as "rail, 
dark and handsome." I Ie wears 
headrags Jnd wire-nmmed glass-
es. I li s soft voice and relaxed 
demeanor belie the obvious pas-
SIOn with which he speaks and 
acts. 

One of the things Vasquez is 
passionate about is the United 

tates. He loves his country. He 
is quick to point this out. 

''The idea that there are lim-
ItS to patriotism, limits to how 
much you can love your country 
- to freedom-loving Americans, 
it's absurd," he said. 

There are people, he believes, 
who do not love this country as 

they should, as he does. For him, 
those people are the ones involved 
with the peace movement. He said 
their "anti-war rallies" have actu-
ally been "anti-American." 

"A minority of people ... hon-
estly hate their country," he said. 
Those who COWHer "what we 
have decided upon" are anti-
American, Vasquez said. 

"If we see ourselves as 
Americans and -America is 
attacked, we're going to support 
President Bush and the military 
110 percent" he said. 

"We support them. We're not 
going to question them." 

Vasquez speaks often of the 
need for unity, which he feels is 
being disrupted by the anti-war 
activists. 

"We need uniry to have 
peace," he said. 

That desire to promote unity 
was part of what motivated 
Vasquez and College 
Republicans president Lucas 
Simmons to organize the Oct. 23 
"Pro-America Rally." 

Vasquez also said he fe lt it was 
important to make sure students 

'Being at a 
university, there are 

a lot of students 
who will end up in a 

position of power. 
What happens today 

is going to affect 
everything in the 

future: 
-Rente MilS 

Roosevelt sophomore 

"hear our side" - that is, the 
side of the organizations with 
which he is involved. 

"It's very disheartening to see 
that there was maybe one voice 
cOrrUng from UCSD," he said, 
meaning the voice of the anti-
war movement and the media 
coverage of its rallies. 

Indeed, at the ral ly, Vasquez 
explained to the crowd, "Our hope 
today is that the UCSD communi-
ty will grasp a greater acknowledg-
ment of our perspective." 

Warren senior Brian Brook 
was a featured speaker at the 
rall y. He is a co-founder and co-
chair of the United Campus 
Coalition. This organization 
tries to foster understanding 
among students of differering 
ethnic, religious and ideological 
backgrounds. 

He is passionate about the 
need for student involvement 
and student activism. We must 
realize, he said, that "apathy can 
no longer carry us forward." 

"We sec people around here 
not caring about what's going 
on," Brook told the Price Center 
crowd. "How many people have 
to die before we do something 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

about people dying and suffering 
ill the world?" 

He advocated an aggressive 
role for the U ni tes Sta tes in 
encouraging and supporting 
democracy throughout the 
world, and stressed that 
Americans must involve them-
selves personally. 

"As lovers of freedom, we must 
fight for freedom not only for 
ourselves, but also each other," he 
said. "We have to believe that 
democracy is .the only way to 
peace." 

Brook and many of the other 
speakers at the rally may have 
viewed war as a means toward 
peace, but that viewpoint was not 
shared by all in attendance. 

~in the rally, banners were 
hung next to the American flag, 
on the Price Center marquee. 
From the balcony above, Anshell 
and Patel lowered the red paper, 
revealing the slogans "War Makes 
It Worse" and "Give Peace a 
Voice." Down on the ground, 
other ISO members held up signs. 

Reactions to the protest were 
rrUxed. 

Simmons was gracious. 
"That's what makes our coun-
try: they have a righ t to have 
that opinion and express it, 
whereas in other countries, they 
wouldn't have that right," he 
said .. "That's what democracy is 
all about." 

Roosevel t junior George 
Davids criticized the dissenters. 

"It's good that we have a pro-
American rally and not an anti-
American rally," he said. "There 
have been too many of those 
lately." 

He added of the protestors, "I 
think it's really funny that a lot of 
these guys say, 'No more racist 
scapegoating' on their signs, and 
we 're, preaching the same mes-
sage here." 

Marshall senior Clint Greene 
cheered the speakers and listened 
intently. 

He was pleased with that 
turnout and with ' those at other 
recent activist rallies on campus. 

"I t's good to see students, 
regardless of their points of view, 
getting involved in some way," 
he said. 

These rallies are only the 
beginning of UCSD's dllal 
response to the growing conflict 
in Afghanistan. Many campus 
organizations plan to hold events 
such as teach-ins and panels in the 
next few months. Though they 
may differ ideologically, both sides 
of this swell in student activism 
suggest that more is to come -
and more may soon be involved.

Wotnen's soccer loses at home 
Broncos snap the-Tritons' 22-game home winning streak 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Contributing Writer 

In its first home loss since 
1998, the UCSD women's soccer 
team lost 1-0 to Cal Poly Pomona 
in overtime at Triton Soccer 
Stadium on Ocr. 24. 

After a scoreless game during 
regulation, Bronco freshman for-
ward Lisa Ar~ujo scored just 59 
seconds into the sudden-death 
overtime to lead II th-ranked Cal 
Poly to victory. 

Bronco forward 1Ia Rudolph 

recorded the assist when she dri b-
bled up the right side of the field 
and crossed the ball in front of the 
Triton net. 

Sophomore Triton goalie IUmi 
Poma deflected the pass back into 
the middle, where Araujo scram-
bled for the rebound and shot the 
ball into the upper corner of the 
goal. 

UCSD's Megan Mendoza, 
Erika Alfredson .and Kristin Jones 
were unusually quiet for the 
Tritons, with only five shots on 
goal among the three. Poma 

played a competitive game and 
recorded six saves on the night. 

With this win, the Broncos 
snapped a Triton 22-game home 
winning streak. Cal Poly also 
snapped the Tritons nine-game 
winning streak. 

This contest spotlighted two of 
the top National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division II 
women 's soccer teams. The 
Broncos were the Division II 
national runners up in 1999 and 
the Tritons won the Division II 
National Championship in 2000. 

With the defea t, the 5th-
ranked Tritons fe ll to 14-2 on the 
season and 11 -2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The Broncos improved to 13 -2-2 
overall and to 9-2-2 in the 
CCAA. 

The Tritons, who clinched the 
division title Oct. 19 against Cal 
State University San Bernardino, 
and the Broncos both will be in 
the CCAA Championship tourna-
ment, which runs from Nov. I 
through Nov. 4 at Triton Soccer 
Stadium. 

Cal Poly shut out by men's soccer 
Defense steps it up for Tritons' victory last Wednesday 
ByANU KUMAR 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
hoped to reach the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championship Tournament, but 
before its game against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Oct. 24, the Tritons 
knew they had dropped out of 
contention for the tourna ment 
wild card berth. 

Nevertheless, the Triton 
defense came up with its third 
straight shutout in the team's 2-0 
victory over Cal Poly Pomona at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

The Broncos had control during 
the first 10 minutes, keeping the ball 
in front of the Triton goal. UCSD 
sophomore goalkeeper Jeremy 
Cookson was faced with several 
Bronco shots early in the game. 

QUICK TURNAROUND 

The Tritons earned their own 
share of scoring opportunities 
when, with less than 2 minutes 
left in the half, freshman mid -
fielder Nick Marquand scored 
UCSD's first goal in two games. 
Marquand took a pass from 
teammate Ryan Tondee and 
found himself one-on-one with 
Bronco goalkeeper Garret 
Williams. The Tritons took the 
1-0 lead when Marquand's shot 
sailed over Williams' head and 
into the net. 

UCSD cushioned its lead in 
the second half when Triton 
freshman defensive back Luke 
Russell found junior Kris Chiles 
in front of the Bronco goal. At 
the 70:29 mark, Chiles' shot went 
past Williams and gave the 
Tritons a 2-0 lead . 

Following the score, junior 

Ryan Weirich took over in the 
Triton goal for Cookson. Cookson 
stopped two Bronco shots and 
Weirich made three saves in the 
final 20 minutes of the game. 
Williams saved two shots for Cal 
Poly Pomona. 

It was a physical game. 
Although the referee called several 
fouls, the two teams continued to 
play rough throughout the game, 
especially during the last 20 min-
utes. With less than 10 minutes 
remaining, Bronco midfieider 
Danny Nishiyama committed a 
hard slide-tackle on Triton mid-
fielder Ryan Blair, who had to 
come out of the game after being 
down on the field for several min-
utes. 

The Broncos, who are in last 
place in the CCAA South 
Division, saw their record fa ll to 2-

10-0 in the CCAA and 2-13-1 
overall. The Tritons' victory 
improved their record to 6-6-1 in 
the CCAA and 6-8-0 overall. 

Of its last seven games, UCSD 
had only lost one of them, but it 
was the team's sluggish start this 
season that hurt its chances of 
playing in the championships. 
Perhaps the absence of A11 -
American forward Bobby Saadati, 
who was sidelined all season, was 
the cause of the 1-7 start. 

Whatever the reason, th e 
Tritons will have to watch the 
tournament from the sidelines 
this year. UC Davis, which beat 
UCSD at home Sept. 28, will be 
the wild card team at the tourna-
ment, which will be hosted by 
UCSD at Triton Soccer Stadium. 
T he tournament is scheduled to 
start Nov. I.

Men's soccer eliminated from playoffs 
Loss to Grand Canyon gives Tritons first losing record in 20 years

The boot: A Triton soccer player kicks the ball in the game against Grand Canyon University last Saturday night. The Tritons 
lost the game and were eliminated from the playoffs despite beating Cal Poly Pomona last weekend. 

By COREY HOLMAN 
Contributing Writer . 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
finished its disappointing 2001 sea-
son with a 5-2 loss to Grand 
Canyon University on Oct. 27 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

UCSD ended the season 6-7-1, 
the first sub-.SOO season for coach 
Derek Armstrong in his 20 years 
at UCSD. The Tritons finished 
with 19 points, nine points away 
from a Californi~ Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championship berth. 

Preseason polls placed UCSD at 
the front of the South Division, but 
this game showed why Grand 
Canyon University ran away with 
the title. 

The Antelopes struck first when 
Luka Muslin finished a Grand 
Canyon counterattack in the 22nd 
minute. Pat Adams scored Grand 
Canyon's second goal less than two 
minutes later after a scramble in 
front of the goal. 

UCSD clawed back into the 
game when sophomore mid fielder

Volleyball splits during road trip 
Tritons finish the weekend at 11-4 in league, 16-6 overall 
By JOSH CROU SE 
Sports Editor 

What a long, strange road it 
has been for the UCSD women's 
volleyball team. After being on 
the road for four of the last five 
weekends, the Tritons spli t 
matches in their final road trip of 
the year. 

UCSD, which brought its 
record to 11-4 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and 16-6 overall, swept Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Oct. 26 at the 
Torodome before losing to Cal 
State Los Angeles 3-1 the next 
night. 

The Tritons dominated Friday 

night's match from start to finish, 
winning 30-15,31-29 and 30-13, 
respectively. UCSD held the 
Toros to only 30 kills and a .086 
hirting percentage while compil-
ing 50 kills on a .274 hitting clip. 

Kathleen Hentz led the way for 
the Tritons with a match-high 16 
kills. Teresa Ohta had a match-
high 40 assists to go along with a 
team-high 11 digs. Lauren Mills 
and Katie Hogan each added eight 
kills in the winning effort. 

CSU Dominguez Hills, which 
fell to 2-14 in the CCAA and 2-20 
overall with the loss, was led by 
Keesha Aldridge'S 10 kills. Amanda 
Horn had a team-high 27 assists 
while Michelle Clary had I3 digs. 

Following the dominating vic-
tory in Carson, UCSD traveled to 
Los Angeles to battle the Golden 
Eagles at the Eagle's Nest. 

Cal State Los Angeles, which 
improved to 12-S in the CCAA and 
14-10 overall with the win, got off 
to an early start and finished strong 
to take the important CCAA 
match, 

The Golden Eagles outhit the 
Tritons en route to a 30-22 victory 
in the opening game. CSU Los 
Angeles took advantage of 10 
UCSD hitting errors in the second 
game to win 30-25 and take a 2-0 
lead in the match. 

The Tritons battled back for a 
30-22 win in the third game before 

the Golden Eagles closed out the 
match with a 30-23 victory in the 
fourth game. 

Brenda Edwards led Cal State 
Los Angeles with a match-high 21 
kills and an impressive .516 hirting 
percentage. Kristy Sain added a 
match-high 46 assists in the win-
ning effort. 

Mills and Hentz each had 11 
kills for UCSD in the loss. Mills 
added a match-high 15 digs. 
Jessica Barner managed 2 S assists 
in two games as the setter. Ohta 
had I3 assists in three games for 
the team. 

The Tritons will host Grand 
Canyon University on Oct. 31 at 7 
p.m. in their next conference match. 

Listless women's soccer team wins 
Tritons beat Grand Canyon, gear up for CCAA playoffs 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Contributing Writer 

In the Tritons' final game of 
the 2001 regular season last 
Saturday, the UCSD women's soc-
cer team struggled but eventually 
disposed of Grand Canyon 
University, 1-0. 

UCSD was coming off a disap-
pointing overtime loss to 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division rival 
C al Poly Pomona on Oct. 24. 

Triton sophomore Megan 
,\1 endo7.a scored the only goal of 
the game in the 16th minute when 
she fi ni hed Kristin Jones ' cross. 
Sophomore Christine Wensel 
made the initial pass that freed 
Jones in the corner. The goal was 

Mendoza's eighth of the year -
second on the team behind senior 
Erika Alfredson. 

Despite the close score, UCSD 
dominated the game. The Tritons 
controlled the midfield while the 
defense stopped nearly every 
Antelope attack. The women, 
however, failed to create many 
scoring chances, leaving Grand 
Canyon University within striking 
range. 

Grand Canyon nearly capital-
ized on UCSD's failure to score 
when, with less than a minute to 
go, Jenny Procter's cross fooled 
Triton sophomore goalie Kami 
Poma, grazing the crossbar before 
haU1]lessly falling to a Triton 
defender. 

Poma recorded only two saves 

Oct. 31, 7 p.m., RIMAC Arena: Women's Volleyball vs. GCU 
Nov. 2, 7:30 p.m., Triton Soccer Stadium: Women's SOCcer vs. UCO 

- both in the second half - lead-
ing UCSD to its sixth CCAA 
shutout of the season. 

The lack of scoring did not 
worry head coach Brian 
McManus. 

"This type of game was to be 
expected," he said. "Neither of us 
had anything to play for and the 
girls may have been looking for-
ward to the [CCAA) tournament." 

This game was also Senior 
Night for the women's soccer 
team. Laura Dooly, Jessica 
Cordova, Elizabeth Hughes, Julia 
Cuder, Erika Alfredson and Nikki 
Richards all played their final reg-
ular-season game at Triton Soccer 
Stadium. Senior Kara Morris, the 
2000 ational Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship defen-

sive most valuable player, could 
not play because she is recovering 
from knee surgery, during which a 
chipped bone was removed last 
week. 

UCSD finished the CCAA reg-
ular season with a 12-2 record, 
easily capturing the South 
Division title. 

However, the year is not over 
for the se.niors - UCSD heads 
into the CCAA Tournament as the 
No. 1 seed and will play North 
Division champions UC Davis on 
Nov. 2 at 7:30 p.m. In the other 
semifinal, Cal Poly Pomona will 
play Cal State Dominguez Hills at 
5 p.m. the same day. The men's 
semifinals start at 11:30 a.m. All 
games wiU be played at Triton 
Soccer Stadium. 

the ball under Antelope keeper 
Greg Spaltro early in the second 
half. Summer's amazing goal put 
the Tritons back into the game and 
gave the squad new life. 

However, less than 5 minutes 
later, UCSD was caught by another 
Antelope counterattack when 
Sergio Iniguez chipped the ball 
over the Tri ton defense to Eric 
Bass, who then scored to put GCU 
up 3-1. Triton defenders contended 
that Grand Canyon was offside at 
the time. 

CCAA leading scorer Luiz 
Arujo and Djordje Grkovic scored 
the last two goals for the Antelopes. 
Triton forward Kris Chiles added 
the second for UCSD, but it was 
too little, too late for the Tritons. 

UCSD goalie Jeremy Cookson 
saved five shots on the day against 
the GCU offense, which outshot 
the Tritons 18-14. 

This game marked the final 
appearance of seniors Jamie 
Lawrence and Ryan Tondee at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

Grand Canyon University will 
head back to Triton Soccer 
Stadium Nov. 1 in order to partici-
pate in the CCAA Championships.

JOSI\ Clu Il Sl- ' 

am - currently 
going through a 

difficult period in my 
life_ 

I sit alone at nights in a dark cor-
ner of my aparonent and cry myself 
to sleep. What could possibly reduce 
this once staggeringly dashing sports 
editor to a mass of patheticness that 
cries like a schoolgirl with a slcinned 
knee? Simple: I don't have cable. 

Not only do I not have cable, 
but I don't get any channels at all. 
Not even the basic networks that 
televisions from the 17th century 
pick up. It is truly pathetic. The 
thing that saddens me the most 
about not having cable - aside 
from missing MTV's newest form 
of trash Tv, "Dismissed" - is 
missing sports programming. 

I love sports. When ESPN 
spawned ESPN2 and then birthed 
ESPN News, 1 almost splodged my 
pants. I have watched the white trash 
O lympics - the Outdoor Games-
late at night on The Duece. I even 
caught myself watching fishing 
shows a few times when I felt partic-
ularly insonmiac-like. 

I used to plan my weeks around 
sports programming. I could take 
comfort in one thing: No matter 
what time it wa~th\!re was always a 
sporting event going on. 
Occasionally, there were gaps in the 
schedule that I would fill by flipping 
to "SportsCenter" to catch up on 
the rest of the sports world, but for 
the most part, the day was full. 

Now, I just sit and stare at my 
blank television screen, occasional-
ly purting on "Varsity Blues" or 
"For Love of the Game" to dull the
