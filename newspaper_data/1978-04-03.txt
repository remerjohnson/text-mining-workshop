Abortion contro~ersy picks up 

by Alan RaueU 
Edhor 

The protest of UCSD students 
over that portion of their Reg 
Fee payments used to fund 
abortions has expanded both in 
numbers and to other Univer-
sity of California schools. 

Seventeen students, seven 
from UCSD, six from UC Davis, 
and four from UC Berkeley, 
have joined ranks with the 
seven "continuing" dissenters 
from UCSD to make a total of 24 
students who have placed, or 
have asked the university to 
place, $120 of their spring 
quarter Reg Fees in trust. 

The seven UCSD students 
who have put their fees in trust 
are James Craighead, Ray 
Gray, Cindy McCrea, Joseph 
Starvish, Amy Steadman, Lynn 
White and Terri Zinner. 

The controven.ial court case 
has become even more com-
plicated by the defense's 
refusing to accept any students 
outside of UCSD as litigants in 
the case. 

David Dorinson, UC counsel, 
was reportedly "shocked" by 
the request of the plaintiffs 
lawyer, Burton Shamsky, to 
allow all seventeen "new" 
students to be litigants in the 
case. 

Dorinson drew the line in only 
giving the status of litigants to 
all UCSD students, stating that 
the Berkeley and Davis 
students would have to pay 
their fees in full by April 28. 
Dorinson's decision has made 
further legal action imminent, 
with a court injunction 
covering the non-UCSD stu-
dents expected. 

Delay in cour1 case 
The court case itself was 

delayed from March 16 to April 
14 because of complications of 
the defense in presenting their 
case at the initial court date. 

In preparing for the court 
case of March 16, the plaintiffs 
entered their opposition to the 
defense's demurrer, reiterat-

ing that .. to subsidize the 
abortion of others violates their 
rights under the First and 
Fourteenth Amendment to the 
constitution. " 

The opposition to the demur-
rer further noted that the issue 

of the case was "whether 
legislative bodies can require 
citizens to pay for other 
people's abortions." 

In pursuing this question four 
causes of action were ad-

The UC Board of Regents, 
at their meeting March 17, 
approved a proposal to 
consider regulations which 
would govern academic 
.conUlcts between UC and the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 

The resolution, which was 
proposed by student Regent 
Michael Salerno, will now be 
referred to the statewide 
Academic Senate's acade-
mic freedom committee and 
to UC President David 
Saxon's office for considera-
tion. 

Saxon and the Academic 
Senate will make their 
recommendations on the 
proposal to the Regents at an 
unspecified later date. 

Salerno's proposal would 
require all members of the 
university to publicly report 
all their contacts with the 

CIA, and prohibit them from 
doing any intelligence .York 
with the agency. 

Salerno said he made the 
proposal because of infor-
mation contained in recent-
ly-released documents 
which show a long history of 
contact between UC and the 
CIA (Triton Times, Feb. 22) . 

He also said he was 
concerned that none of the 
documents made reference 
to UC's involvement with 
CIA-funded drug research, 
which, he said, "may be 
continuing today." 

Saxon, in response to 
Salerno's statements, said, 
"There is nothing that 
indicates any relationship 
with the CIA which in any 
way violates proper prac-
tices." 

Volk to file 
assault case 
by Steve Gould 
Sports Editor 

An attorney for UCSD 
basketball player Peter Volk 
says he will file criminal 
charges of assault and battery 
against an Azusa -P acHic 
College player, his coach and 
the school as a result of a punch 
thrown during a conference 
game Feb. 25 . 

The complaints will allege 
that Mike Berry , then the 
starting center for Azusa , 
punched V otk in the face in the 
first half of UCSD's season 
finale at the UCSD gymnasium. 
Volk received ten stitches 
above his right eye and along 
his nose and a fractured right 
cheekbone from the incident, 
which was witnessed by over 
500 people, the Triton's largest 
home crowd of the season. 

Marlborough Watson, Volk's 
legal counsel, said complaints 
will be issued to Azusa head 
coach Cliff Hamlow and Azusa-
Pacific College as well as Berry 
because "as coach, Hamlow 
could not control Berry ' s 
actions, but the school and 
coach are legally responsible to 
do so." 

Ala Kermit 
In explaining why he decided 

to purse assault and battery 
charges, Watson alluded to the 
case of Kermit Washington, the 
ex-Los Angeles Laker basket-
ball forward now with the 
Boston Celtics, who punched 
Rudy Tomjanovich of the 
Houston Rockets in the face 
during a melÂ¢e in an NBA 
contest last October. 

"Since the Federal Court 
allowed Houston to file charges 
against the Lakers," Watson 
said, "we will base our case on 
the same type of legal reason-
ing ... Azusa-P acific had 
responsibility to control his 
(Berry's) action. " 

. Berry, a 6'7" senior from 
Costa Mesa who averaged 10.2 
points and 6.6 rebounds per 
game, was suspended from the 
Azusa team for the remainder 
of the season by Hamlow, even 

though the Cougars had 
qualified for a bertn in the 
NAJA District Three playoffs . 
Without Berry, Azusa was 
eliminated in the first round of 
the playoffs by Biola College. 

Despite the uniqueness of the 
case , Watson " strongly 
believes a verdict in Volk 's 
favor is possible." However, 
due to the heavy load of cases 
piled up in San Diego, Watson 
said, " it could be over a year 
until the case comes to court. " 

According to C. Logan 
Mckechnie of the San Diego 
District Attorney 's office , 
"Volk's case has been referred 
to the City Attorney's office to 
determine felony or misde-
meanor status pending on 
medical information sub -
mitted." 

If convicted, Berry and 
Hamlow could recelve maxl-
mum sentences of one year in a 
county jail and $1000 fines . 
Pickett dies 
in Mexico 

David Pickett, 22-year-old 
UCSD student , died last 
Monday from injuries incurred 
in a traffic accident in Mexico. 

Pickett, a leading force 
behind campus newspaper the 
new indicator, was vacationing 
in Mexico with three other 
UCSD students . The tragic 
accident occurred when the car 
in which Pickett was a 
passenger swerved onto the 
shoulder of the road to avoid 
hitting an oncoming car. 

Water bottles carried in the 
car Pickett was in broke, with 
the glass splintering his liver 
and spleen. Internal bleeding 
proved to be too much, as it was 
several hours before Pickett 
could receive surgery. 

Pickett's presence at UCSD, 
and the outside world, will be 
sorely missed. He excelled at 
his work, but more impor-
tantly, as a person. The ~ntire 
staff of the Triton Tlmes 
expresses it deepest regrets. 

Nierenberg: direGting policies for tomorrow 
by Alan Russell 

Editor 
His latest appointment is to the Chairmanship 

of the Advisory Committee to NASA. 
To most people such a position would be ' a 

great feather in one's cap, but Dr. William 
Nierenberg, Director of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (SIO), already has a chief's 
headdress of honors, and views the appointment 
as little more than a job that has to be done, 
albeit a very important job. 

The name of Nierenberg, and even SIO itself, 
is not often recognized or connected by UCSD 
undergraduates as being part of the school, but 
both the man and the institution are viewed by 
many knowledgeable outsiders as two of the 
mOlt important components of UCSD. 

In federal grants alone, SIO usually gets 
between 50 and 60 percent of all UCSD money, 
and this includes UCSD's medical school. 
Worldwide there is an unqualified respect for 
the institution, and though SIO has been in 

~xistence almost a long as the University of 
California, much of its present position of 
eminence has come under the 13 year reign of 
Nierenberg. 

Nierenberg is an interesting character - and 
the word charact r must be emphasized. In 
interviewing him one becomes aware of a 
compolite penonality. Alternately lecturing, 
appeallq and theorizing, one Nierenberg 

as the dictating director, as the struggling and 
ambitious New York City youngster ("my 
family was about as poor as urban people can ., 
get"), and as the thoughtful nuclear physicist. 
With hands constantly moving, sometimes 
supercharged like a maestro undergoing shock 
therapy, one cannot ignore his intensity. 

Nierenberg's favorite topic of conversation is 
naturally SIO itself. In describing the far 
reaching work of the institation, Nierenberg 
acts the role of the proud father, imaginary 
cigars thrust upon you while he explains the 
various research going on. His strongest point of 
emphasis to ~ layman is the immensity, the 
far-reaching consequences, of oceanic studies, 
which can and are found by Nierenberg to have 
some relevance and relation with almost every 
hard science. 

"Some say that it is a paradox that an 
oceanographic institution is involved in so many 
diverse fields of research," said Nierenberg. 
"But the vastness of oceanic studies and their 
relation to a number of related studies ~annot be 
underplayed. Scripps has a very strong 
ecological thrust. The science of ecology was 
bom in the oceans, as well as the food chain." 

Nierenberg said that in bis years at SIO it had 
"gone the direction he expected" - namely that 
of working in the future, staying ten to 20 yea 
ahead of current world thinking. He cited

Reflections 

UC 'versus JC 
by Sam Beedle 

Here is it. Registration Day at UCSD. Things don't appear to be 
much different from junior college. Signs and numbers on the 
buildings are hidden away in architectural folds and creases so as 
to not detract from the aesthetics of the edifice. It's nine o'clock 
and I already have a parking ticket. The faculty is totally invisible 
- but the staff is on the scene. These folks smile and nod . But, 
nobody has ever asked that question before. So you'll have to go 
over there. Where? Oh, there! I was there earlier and they said ... 

Sam Â·Beedle, a Muir student, formerly attended Mesa College in 
SaD Die,o. 

I miss the bedlam at the junior college though. Here at UCSD, 
they confuse you quietly. No microphones are tapped here by stern 
deans in horn rims. No student assistant scurries into the next 
room to adjust the public address system when it squeaks. No 
indeed, UCSD does things differently than they do at junior 
college. . 

"We don't exactly know how -great the difference is because 
none of us were ever students in a junior college - you 
understand. to 

The orientation briefing goes down in a classroom instead ofthe 
gymnasium. A couple of staffers from the Muir Provost's Office 
issue folders which contain class schedules, data sheets, and of 
course, a one day parking _pass. 

For one fleeting moment I thought of sprinting down the hall and 
stairs and out to the parking lot where, amid smiles and cheers, I 
would anoint my tired old spad with a genuine UCSD parking 
permit. Then I remembered the ticket. I shrugged and sat down_ 

Welcome! " We are glad you are here, " the dean tells us. Heand 
his people go on for the next hour or so paraphrasing the contents 
of the registration packets. (Please tum to pale 3)

Clonin scientist sa s he is not a clonin advocate 
Is man ready for human cloning? 

by David Rorvik 
Pacific News Service 

(Editor's Dote: Tbis article is tbe first 
extensive statement by David Rorvik, author 
of tbp. just-released book, In His Waage 
The Cloning of a Man. Since the claims 
made in the book were first publicized 
,hey have stirred a storm of debate in the 
scientific community over whether the 
allegation that a child has actually been 
created in a test tube is true or whether the 
book is a giant hoax. Here, Rorvik, for the 
first time, provides some answers to his 
critics.) I 

A human being has been cloned. I make this 
assertion in my book, " In His Image: The 
Cloning of a Man," and I stand behind that 
claim today. I am not, however, an advocate 
of human cloning. My decision to become 
involved in this project came after months of 
soul searching and careful consideration of 
the many bio-ethical issues at stake. These 
moral issues occupy the first half of my book. 

It finally became evident to me that this 
project would eventually proceed with or 
wi thout me, and so I consented to assist on the 
condition that, though I could protect the 
identities of those involved, I would be 
permitted to report some of the details of this 
work. It is my hope that the public might thus 
be encouraged to participate in the the 
decision-making process that, ideally, will 
lead to the wise regulation of all forms of 
genetic engineering. 

Preceding publication of my book, a 
number of scientific authorities took the 
position that human cloning, while perhaps 
not always to be desired, at least posed little 
threat to humanity_ An editorial in Science 

.. Magazine in 1974, for example, called the 
prospect of human cloning "hardly 
terrifying" and added that if it were finally 
prohibited by law "an occasional violation" 
of that law "would not shake the heavens ." 
Yet my claim that a genetic replication of a 
man has now been created through the 
stimulated growth of a single body cell rather 
than through the union of an egg and sperm 
cell has unleaShed a furor practically 
unprecedented in science. 

Why are some of the same scientists who 
recently seemed to view so serenely the 
prospect of human cloning so upset over the 
possibility today? Why are some other 
scientists who just in the last few years 
predicted that human cloning would soon be 
accomplished now so intent on making the 
public believe that this cannot happen for 
years or even decades? 

An answer to both these questions has been 
suggested by science writer Judith Randal. 
In a long article in the Washington Post, 
Randal submits evidence that though some 
scientists challenge the claims made in my 
book, all of the major elements needed to 
clone a human exist in laboratories today, 
and in her words ' 'have been lying around -
some of them for year~ - waiting to be 
assembled." But these facts and others, she 
adds, some scientists of tature have been 
reluctant to admit, "In fact," she says in her 
Post article, " the scientific establishment 
seems to have closed ranks - possibly 
fearing public revulsion a nd legislative 
"eaction - to deny the sugge tion that human 
cloning could occur." 

------

Randal cites as an example the recent 
statements of Nobel Prize winning molecular 
biologist James Watson, noting that he 
recently appeared on network television, â¢â¢ all 
but insisting that the whole thing was out of 
the question, " Yet he thought enough of the 
possibility to have written in 1971 an article 
called "Moving Toward the Clonal Man." In 
it he called attention to "unexpectedly rapid 
progress " in cell fusion and embryo 
transplant work of a sort detailed in my book, 
anp chided these a mong his colleagues who 
believed that cloning was still only a remote 
possibility. 

If one is tempted to ask, â¢ 'Will the real 
James Watson please stand up? " the same 
question would have to be asked of other 
scientists who have recently done similar 
about-faces. 

Many of these scientists, I believe, are not 
really so doubtful about my claim as they are 
fearful that if the public believed me, then 
their own research into far more complex, far 
more promising but also far more perilous 
areas of "recombinant DNA" will come 
4nder new public scrutiny, and as the Post 
points out, perhaps legislative control. The 
public at the present time has only the 
dimmest awareness of what recombinant 
DNA is all about. 

Human cloning is dramatic and intriguing 
but as yet it is, as the Science editorial points 
out, of little importance alongside other 
developments in genetic engineering. A new 
recombinant DNA work sees scientists 
already splicing together the genes of unlike 
species to create new life forms in the 
laboratory , The new research is widely 
expected to create a new multi-billion dollar 
industry and anything that might upset the 
public, draw attention to new research, or 
generally " rock the boat" is, of course, 
feared by those involved in the research. 

Scientific breakthroughs in molecular 
biology in the last two years have led us to the 
brink of a power more awesome than 
anything promised by discoveries of the so-
called "Atomic Age." As Scientific American 
summed it up in 1977, "Forthe first time, man 
has developed a capacity for almost absolute 
control over the material in his genes." That 
man can now begin to truly take charge of his 
own evolution and remake himself and his 
world in the image of his own desiring must 
be accounted the most revolutionary 
development in the history of the world. 

Unfortunately, many scientists working in 
this field are of the opinion that the public is 
not smart enough to be fully informed of what 
is transpiring or to participate in the life and 
death decisions that are already daily being 
made in laboratories around the world. In 
short they want to work unencumbered by 
public doubts and fears . Yet "as Science 
MqaziDe has acknowledged, there have 
already been frightful " close calls" in the 
laboratory in creation of new life forms. 

Researchers. at General Electric Research 
and Development Center in Schnectady, 
N. Y ., not long ago created an E -coli 
bacterium with a new gene using some of 
these newly recombinant DNA techniques. 
The new gene was coded for the production of 
cellulase, an enzyme that breaks down

You can almost feel the hook set. 
Have you ever met a student who was financially independent? 

Did you ever talk to a student who was really paying all the school 
related expenses from an earned income? Isn't everybody here in 
the same fix I am, i.e. , being financed by some person, or some 
agency to a degree? Even work-study is federally subsidized. 
Indeed, one of the more essential indulgences with which society 
favors students is the willingness to assist one who seeks higher 
learning. More often than not, this assist takes a form we can all 
smell, touch, and feel - bucks . 

We' re all joint ventures. Somewhere, for each of us there is a 
sponsor (be it the Fed, our parents, the VA, or whomever) with 
enough faith in our guts and energy to bankroll our education. That 
sp.onsor is laying down some pretty hea vy bread. I figure that mine 
must be on my side. 

Why then, would I want to deny my fiscal sponsor any 
information? How does my being an adult, and " fully responsible 
for my actions" work to inhibit the release of information? 

Why has tqe government legislated itself into the act? What is 
the real reason for granting license to federally supported schools, 
permitting them to deny requests for information from parents? 

Parents appear to be the only entities to whom data can be 
successfully denied since all other fiscal sponsors (government 
agencies and departments of the university) can gain access to 
data by contacting the appropriate school official. 

It looks like an almost subliminal inference that parents, and 
therefore families , don' t count. Now why should the Fed want us to 
think tilat? Are we easier to manage as large groups than as 
family units?

Fedlilly awarene â¢â¢ Â· being Inveltlgated 

The rhythm. method revised 
by Michael Castleman 
Pacific News Service 

Every morning. San Francisco medical 
student Anne Carlyle, 25. takes her 
temperaturt", performs a vaginal examination 
and records her findings on a chart and 
mentions them to her husband. This simple 
routine Is how Carlyle practices birth control. 
She uses the "fertility awareness" method. a 
modernized rhythm system that enables women 
to identify accurately their fertile days each 
month by examining their cervical mucus. 

"I've used pills condoms, a diaphragm - and 
prayer " says Carlyle, who has relied on 
fertility awareness for a year. ':We sti!1 use a 
condom or diaphragm when I m fertile, but 
when I'm not, there's no need to use anything. 
Every birth control method causes some hassle. 
Why use one if you don't have to?" 

Fertility awareness and traditional rthythm 
both attempt to identify a woman's fertile d~ys. 
the week to 10 days each month around the tIme 
she releases an egg, or ovulates. 

The key difference between the two methods 
is that to practice traditional rhythm, a woman 
pays attention to the calendar. T~ practice 
fertility awareness, she pays attentIOn to. her 
body. 

"Fertility awareness teaches women to 
communicate with their bodies directly," says 
Karen Faire-Hammond, a consultant to the U.S. 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare 
in California. "The body clearly announces its 
fertile time each month if a woman is trained to 
recognize the signals." 

Faire-Hammond. who has used the method 
herself for live years and has taught it for two 
years, says that calendars are unreliable 
fertility indicators. Traditional rhythm, she 
explains, assumes that women ovulate 
regularly; but very few women actually do. And 
the menstrual cycle of those women who do 
ovulate regularly can shift unexpectedly when 
they travel, get sick or suffer emotional stress. 

Studies to date indicate that fertility 
awareness works as well as other birth control 
methods, says Faire-Hammond. A five-country 
study of 2,000 couples in 1975, by Dr. Claude 
Lanctot at Fairfield University, sbowed the 
method to be up to 98 percent effective. 

And fertility awareness is "more than just a 
method for preventing conception," says 
Deborah Rogow, a health educator who teaches 
fertility awareness for the San Francisco Health 
.Department. "It can help couples who want to 
conceive a child by pinpointing the fertile days." 

The National Institutes of Health is now 

the time of ovulation. then closes, hardens and 
drops back into the vagina when the woman is no 
longer fertile. 

Rogow's course in fertility awareness meets 
three hours every other week for three sessions. 
A dozen women attend each course, and many 
bring husbands or boyfriends. Rogow says she 
explains the physiological basis for fertility 
awareness and discusses each wom~n's chart 
with her individually. She advises that a woman 
chart her mucus, temperature and cervix size 
for several months before relying on fertility 
awareness for contraception. 

"Many women say: 'This is so simple, why 
didn't anyone tell us before? '" Rog6w says. One 

. reason, she contends, is that " drug companies 
have supported most contraceptive" research. 
Their financial Interest lay in developing pills 
and IUDs. They haven't supported fertility 

. awareness research because it allows women to 
rely on themselves, instead of on a drug 
company product. When women who have had 
bad experiences with pills and IUDs realize this, 
they get very angry. " 

Rogow says men who attended her classes 
have been enthusiastic about the experience. 

"I'm really glad 1 learned it," says Carlyle's 
28-year-old husband, a graduate student at the 
University of California-Berkeley. " I used to be 
in the dark about birth control aOnd Anne's 
fertility. Now I just look at the chart. Our 
contraception is more out Â· in the open, more 
integrated into our lives." 

The initial impetus behind fertility awareness 
came from Roman Catholics, because rhythm is 
the only contraceptive method the Church 
allows. Drs. John and Evelyn Billings, an 
Australian Catholic husband-and-wife team, 
correlated the cervical mucus cycle with 
fertility 20 years ago, when fertiHty research 
here focused on developing the pill and IUD. 

Pope Paul VI renewed his predecessors' ban 
of all contraceptive devices in 1968 when many 
believed the Church's position should be 
modified . A 1976 survey of American Catholics 
attributed steep declines in cburch attendance 
and financial support to the ruling against birth 
control. 

Recently, Pope Paul endorsed efforts to 
improve the rhythm method. He said technical 
solutions to buman problems had achieved 
"deceptive results," an apparent reference to 
the health hazards associated with the pill and 
IUD.

stresses abstinence on fertile days. The secula â¢

are expected next year. 
Fertility awareness experts caution that 

women should take courses in the method before 
attempting to classify their mucus , since 
individual women have different mucus cycles. 

" It takes some time to learn," say Rogow, 
" but it becomes like second nature, like driving 
a car." 

Women can identify ovulatiQn by studying 
their tempera ture every morning. Temperature 
rises noticeably during ovulation, and the cervix 
undergoes cyclic changes as well. It opens, 
softens and lifts away from the vagina around 

HEW plans to award a one-year $100,000 
contract for a fact-finding mission to study who 
teaches fertility awareness in the United States, 
how and to whom. HEW sources said an 
unexpectedly large number of bids have been 
submitted for this contract, many by Catholic 
agencies. 

" Fertility awareness is the hottest thing 
happening in birth control," Rogow says.

" older and more philosophica l

Looking to the future , he said, 

" I'm optimistic for cynical 
reasons . The future will be 
different but I'm sure we can 
adapt. We've already given up 
an incredible amount of 
freedom, and we' ll have to give 
up more, but in doing such we'll 
gain new freedoms."

to enjoy, as well as pursuing 
other such pleasurable activi-

The ASUCSO is governed ~ a

A student's personal and mental 
wellÂ· being are the main concerns of 
the Student Health Center. There 
are competent personnel on du ty 24 
hours each day. Students are 
eligible for diagnosis, testing, 
treatment and counseling . The 
pharmacy service provides free 
nonÂ·prescriptior. items, and fills 
prescriptions at low cost. More 
information on the SHS can be 
found in the Student Health 
Almanac which is free at the Health 
Center. 

The birth co.trol diaic 
The UCSO Contraceptive 

Counseling and Education Clink is 
a service for both men and women 
which provides contraceptive 
information/education, pregnancy 
and sexuality counseling and 

referral when appropriate . The 
CCEC is located in the Student 
Health Center and is open MondayÂ· 
Friday, 8-4:30 on a dropÂ·in or 
appointment basis. 

The clinic functions as an 
education center and offers 
students an opportunity to learn 
more about their sexual health 
through gynecological exams and to 
evaluate their feelings related to 
birth control and sexuality. The mao 
jor emphasis is to offer alternatives, 
thus, no one method of birth control 
is pushed nor is any alternative in 
pregnancy situations suggested as 
best. 

The CCEC is often asked to 
speak to groups of students either in 
an informal setting or as part of a 
training program and such 
invitations are encouraged. If you 
are interested in having the CCEC 
conduct such a ~sion, please 
contact the CCEC office: 452Â·2669. 

The college governments are 
unique in that they are not entirely 
studentÂ·run. The entire college, 
including faculty and staff is 
represented. Most are based on the 
traditional council set-up. 

Revelle 
The Revelle College government 

is called the Revelle Committee on 
College Affairs (RCCA) . It is 
composed of six students, three 
faculty members, and representaÂ· 
tives from the Resident Dean's, 

College Dean's, and Provost's 
offices. It deals with problems of the 
college such as overcrowding and 
curriculum. It also allocates money 
for college related activities.

Day Care Center 
You may find that taking care of a family can restrict 

your study hours to a critical degree, and you may need 
a day care center to help take care of your children. 

UCSO's day care center program strives to optimize 
a child's individual potential for intellectual and 
emotional growth. and to maximize physical 
development . . 

The Center accepts children from walking age to 5~ 
years but has a limited number of spaces. The center 
opens at 7:45 am and closes at 5: 15 pm. The phone 
number is 452Â·2768. A fee is asked of parents who send 
children to the center. 

Legal Services 
The Legal Service Office is responsible for the 

development, review and coordination of campus.wide 
legal matters. SpecificaJly, the staff renders advice to all 
UCSO students, including jail release services for any st~de~t ~ho is arrested; provides IegaJ counseting to 
mmorlty m all discrimination matters and acts as 

consulta~t to the UCSO community. 
~~ office is located in the Student Center Complex, 

BUlldmg B, and can be contacted at ext. 4374. 

If you need to be hospitalized, the insurance program, 
will pay up to $1,500 in hospital benefits. While $1,500 
may seem like a lot, it is not a great deal at today's 
soaring hospital costs. The campus has therefore made 
an additional optioaal insurance plan available to 
registered students. This doubles the hospital benefits 
you may receive up to $3 ,000 and also provides a major 
medical expense plan that pays 80 percent of additional 
covered expenses up to $2,000 after you have paid the 
first $100 of bills and 100 percent of all additional 
covered expenses up to $25,000. The premium for this 
additional protection is very low at $5 per Quarter. 

Students who previously purchased the additional 
coverage will receive renewal notices and may pay the 
additional premium by mail. Freshmen must apply for it 
during the open enroUment period, which extends up 
to 30 days into each quarter. Kathleen Mooney, 
insurance representative, is at the Student Health 
Center frOl1l 8 to 11:30 am and from 1 to 4:30 pm 
Monday through Friday to assist with insurance 
purchase and renewals. She can be reached at ext. 
2123: it is preferable to call before chopping by to see 
her. 

Students who are already weIIÂ·covered under health 
ill&Ul'ance policy from home, probably won't need the 
additional coverage. Students on Financial Aid may 
qualify for this additional policy as part of their financial 
aid packet. Check with your Financial Aid officer or 
talk to your college section in the Financial Aid Office to 
find out if you are eligible for the extra insurance 
protection.

cellulose, a plant protein that is 
normally indigestible by 
humans. 

Apparently the G.E. people 
thought that ~heir new new bug, 
quietly nestled in the human 
gut, might enable us to eat hay 
and grass, a possibility that 
however unpalatable might 
ease some of the world food 
shortage and that might also 
make feasible a multi-millien 
dollar market in new food 
products. It begins to develop 
signs, however, that the break-
down products of cellulose 
might be imperfectly absorbed 
in the lower intestine, resulting 
in gas buildup and perpetual, 
possibly lethal, stomach upset. 
There was more to this than just breaking down cellulose. 
An E-coli that was only half-
way capable of processing 
plant protein could be a very 
dangerous bug. 

The point must be made here 
that several of the same 
scientists, who in an effort to 
quiet public concern, charac-
terize human cloning as too 
difficult or too dan.erous to be 
accomplished at this time are 
actually engaged in research 
that requires far more skill and 
danger than human cloning, 
Those who dare to question the 
.wisdom or the more dangerous 
recombinant work - and their 
number includes Nobel Prize 
winners - have been characÂ· 
terized by James Watson (as 
quoted in Time magazine) as 
"shits", "kooks" and "Incom-
petent."
