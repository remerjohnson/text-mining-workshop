As students fill out election ballots and select their 
desired candidates for next year’s A.S. Council represen-
tatives this week, they will find surveys asking for their 
opinions on two very different topics: residential security 
officers and student activity fees. Students will be asked to 
answer questions about how the presence of RSOs affects 
campus life, as well as for their opinions on how to best 
utilize the funds from a probable student-run referendum 
in the near future. 

The results of the survey — provided that a large 
enough quota of students give their responses — will indi-
cate to next year’s A.S. representatives the student body’s 
view of RSOs and the likely necessity of raising the quar-
terly student activity fees that are used to sponsor UCSD 
events such as the Sun God Festival, A.S. President Marco 
Murillo said. 

The two discussion topics, proposed by Murillo and 
approved by the A.S. Council, reflect the desire of UCSD’s 
student government to gauge opinions about RSO-student 
interaction and the likelihood of rising student activity 
fees in reaction to recent concerns surrounding both these 
issues, A.S. Elections Manager Tanya Piyaratanaphipat 
said.

The questions concerning RSO interaction with on-
campus residents are meant to identify key problems 
students perceive about the presence and actions taken by 
RSOs on campus. Though the administration altered parts 
of the RSO program after a report that was released over a 
year ago found that students were dissatisfied with officers 
still “patrolling” students rather than focusing on student 
safety, Murillo said.

“Our question about a future referendum will help us 
gauge student opinion about how much students would be 
willing to give up to increase the funding available for cam-
pus events such as Bear Gardens,” Piyaratanaphipat said.

The survey questions focusing on how much students 
would be willing to increase their quarterly activity fees 
ask which events they feel the council should prioritize 
with the resulting funding. Students can select events such 
as Sun God or the A.S. Pancake Breakfast, depending on 
which activity they are most interested in.

Students already pay an activity fee of $28 per quar-

ter, and the council uses $21 of this money to fund these 
events in addition to student-run organizations. But the 
A.S. Council has seen an increase in requests from student 
organizations every quarter this year — far outstripping 
last year’s requests — which has led to persistent questions 
about the availability of funds for both events and organi-
zations.

The overwhelming increase in funding requests 
occurred as a result of a switch from paper forms to online 
forms, streamlining the process and making it easier for 
organizations to send in their requests to the A.S. Finance 
Committee for review.

Campus Police Disclose 
Threat Alert Prematurely
By Connie Shieh
Staff Writer

The UCSD Police Department 
issued a campuswide Community 
Alert Bulletin on April 4 concerning a 
male who purportedly made threats to 
commit a shooting at an unspecified 
San Diego college campus, despite the 
fact that the information was meant for 
college law enforcement only.

Local college campus police depart-
ments were notified to be on the look-
out for Thai Thanh Dang, a 5-foot-10-
inch Asian male.  

According to the alert, Dang is not 
wanted for any specific crime but is 
a person of interest to campus police 
because of the threats. Law enforce-
ment should be notified if he appears 
on campus so that officials can make 
contact with him.

The alert stated that Dang has a 
history of threatening to kill police 
officers, and that he was arrested last 
fall on suspicion of kidnapping a female 
in Sacramento County. Given his past 
history, the campus police department 
advises that people should consider 
him armed and dangerous.

Dang was released from a 
Sacramento jail two weeks ago. Police 
are unaware of his current where-
abouts.

Although the police alert regard-
ing Dang’s threats was not meant to 
be released to the public, several news 
reports reiterating the information pro-
vided in the alert surfaced as early as 
the evening of April 4.

“The information [the Sheriff ’s 
Department] sent to the colleges was 
supposed to be intelligence, but it 

wasn’t supposed to be disseminated 
to the news like this, because it causes 
anxiety,” Lt. Sylvester Washington of 
the San Diego Sheriff ’s Department 
said. “We really 
don’t know 
how factual the 
informat ion 
is.”

U C S D 
Chief of Police 
Orville King 
said that the 
informat ion 
r e g a r d i n g 
Dang did not 
come from 
the SDSD. He added that campus law 
enforcement’s priority is to keep the 
community well-informed and safe 
from any podessible danger. 

“We elected to modify the flyer and 
provide basic information about Mr. 
Dang to our campus community that 
was helpful for their safety,” King said. 
“The release of information is precau-
tionary.”

Several students indicated that they 
appreciated the information despite 
reservations by Washington and the 
ambiguity of the campus alert e-mail.

“I think people would appreciate 
being informed of the possibility that 
something bad could happen,” John 
Muir College sophomore Jacqueline 
Cohen said.  “Even though the e-mail 
was vague, I think that sharing this 
information campuswide is just an 
attempt to prevent a school shoot-
ing.”

Fox Stays Guarded Over Rumored Texas Move

High School Shooting Ranges 
Become Targets of  Criticism

Marye Anne Fox
UCSD Chancellor

By Smruti Aravind
Senior Staff Writer

Widespread rumors last month 
suggested that Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox may be in the running for 
the top position at the University of 
Texas vacated by Mark G. Yudof, who 
was recently named president of the 
University of California.

Fox has neither publicly con-
firmed nor denied the rumors. 

While she said she was flattered 
by the suggestion of returning to 
Texas, the state where she first began 
her career in higher eductaion, Fox 

stressed her obligation to UCSD. 
“I have made a commitment to 

UC San Diego and am eager to guide 
a new leadership team in continuing 
the rise of our university,” Fox said 
in an e-mail. “Top-notch research 
universities require strong leadership 
and management skills, in addition 
to a strong academic background. 
The people who have the experi-
ence, appreciation, understanding 
and ability to balance the many com-
peting elements of the 21st century 
research university are not easy to 
find — especially those who embrace 
and will uphold the value of shared 
governance.”

Fox has served as chancellor of 
UCSD since April 2004 but maintains 
deep ties to Texas. She spent 22 years 
as a faculty member of the University 
of Texas system, most of them as a 
professor of chemistry. 

Fox was a candidate to lead UT 
in 2002, but withdrew due to previ- See FOX, page 7

The implementation of a Junior 
Reserve Officer’s Training Corp pro-
gram at Mission Bay High School and 
Lincoln High School in San Diego last 
fall, which gives students the opportu-
nity to train with high-powered pellet 
guns at the campus’ new shooting 
ranges, has sparked controversy from 
local activist groups opposed to the 
presence of firearms at high schools. 

The Education Not Arms 
Coalition and the project on Youth 
and Non-Military Opportunities have 
partnered to protest against what they 
claim to be a violation of the schools’ 
“zero tolerance” policies regarding 
firearms on campus. 

Earlier this year, the two groups 
collected over 1,000 signatures on a 
petition demanding the removal of 
ROTC firing ranges from local high 
schools, which they presented to the 
San Diego School Board.  

Additionally, the two groups have 
claimed that the presence of these 
ROTC programs leads students to 
be misleadingly tracked into military 
programs without being given clear 
alternatives. 

Students at Mission Bay and 
Lincoln high schools, many of whom 
have protested and testified before the 
San Diego School Board, have found 
themselves automatically enrolled 
in ROTC training programs at the 
beginning of fall semester. California 
Education Code 51750 deems partici-
pation in such programs voluntary.

Thurgood Marshall junior Hossein 
Ayazi has been working with Project 
Yano since fall quarter.

Med Center Adapts to 
Premature Birth Trend

Last week, UCSD Hillcrest 
Medical Center celebrated the 
expansion of its Neonatal Intensive 
Care Unit, designed to offer 24-
hour specialized care for premature 
infants and newborns with compli-
cations.

A new 1,795-square-foot unit 
facility and an additional nine beds 
will increase the center’s capacity 
for infants needing Level III neonatal 
intensive care, from 780 to more than 
900. The UCSD Medical Center’s 
$2.6-million project is the first in a 
series of initiatives to expand and 
improve services for women and 
infants.

Neil Finer, director of the Division 
of Neonatology at UCSD Medical 
Center, said the expansion is a 
positive improvement that will help 
address the growing demand for 
intensive infant care.

“One in eight babies across the 
U.S. is born prematurely,” he said. 
“Here in San Diego we have seen 
a sustained increase in the number 
of infants needing intensive care 
for more than five years now. By 
expanding our services, we can 
treat more of these fragile infants to 
help ensure healthy outcomes.”

More than 3,000 babies are 
born each year at Hillcrest Medical 
Center, which is the only academic 
medical center in San Diego and the 
only hospital offering the combina-
tion of a labor-and-delivery service 
and a regional Level III NICU on the 
same floor.

Level III hospitals care for babies 
who are delivered before 32 weeks 
gestation, or who require intensive 

care before, during or after delivery 
due to serious illnesses or abnor-
malities.

UCSD Art Historian to 
Present Paintings at OMA

UCSD professor emeritus of 
American comparative literature 
Bram Dijkstra, a nationally recog-
nized art historian, will speak April 
10 at 7 p.m. at the Oceanside 
Museum of Art on a new exhibit that 
highlights some of the finest work of 
San Diego painters.

Dijkstra’s show, entitled 
“Masterpieces of San Diego 
Painting: Fifty Works from Fifty 
Years, 1900-1950,” features master-
pieces from private collections and 
museums, including the celebrated 
plein air painters of San Diego such 
as Maurice Braun, Charles Fries, 
Alfred Mitchell and Charles Reiffel, 
as well as heralded San Diego mod-
ernists, including Belle Baranceanu, 
Dan Dickey and Ethel Greene. 

“As the works in this exhibition 
demonstrate, during the first few 
decades of the last century the fea-
tures of the local landscape Braun 
had enumerated with such enthusi-
asm, indeed lured numerous artists 
into producing some of their finest 
work,” Dijkstra said. “Thus, through-
out the ‘20s and even during the 
early ‘30s, the most visible presence 
in the San Diego art world would 
continue to be the landscape paint-
ers who were closely connected 
with what has since become known 
as California Impressionism.”

Dijkstra has also written a 140-
page catalogue to accompany 
the exhibit, which closes June 29, 
2008.

Between increased student orga-
nizations’ requests and campus events 
such as the Sun God Festival that 
become more expensive each year, it 
is extremely likely that a student-run 
referendum will have to take place 
in the future asking students to pay a 
greater activity fee per quarter, accord-
ing to Murillo.

“Through the survey question 
about a possible referendum as well as 
other avenues, A.S. Council is explor-
ing the possibility of a referendum to 
maintain and hopefully continue to 
expand campus events such as Sun 
God,” Murillo said. 

A task force, formed at the begin-
ning of the school year to explore 
multiple aspects of the funding prob-
lem, will convene after the results of 
the survey are analyzed, and make a 
recommendation to the A.S. Council 
regarding student interest in an activ-
ity-fee referendum.

The information gleaned from the 
two survey questions will help the 
council collaborate with administra-
tors to work toward any necessary 
changes in both the RSO program and 
event and organization funding. 

“Once we have gauged student 
opinion, we can take the student input 
from the survey and hopefully use 
it to demonstrate to the administra-
tion what students truly care about,” 
Murillo said.

tion while taking an ethnic studies class,” Ayazi 
said. “We had a community service requirement, 
so I decided to volunteer.”

Ayazi said that Project Yano has been con-
cerned primarily with the legal aspects sur-
rounding the controversy. 

“While we volunteered at Mission Valley and 
Lincoln, we focused on the inconsistencies in 
school policy,” Ayazi said. “Schools nationwide 
are required to maintain a zero tolerance policy 
toward firearms, and the presence of firing 
ranges on school grounds is a direct contradic-
tion to that.” 

Ayazi added that these ROTC programs serve 
to create inconsistencies in educational opportu-
nities in regards to race and ethnicity. 

“In particular, we are concerned that many 
low-income students and students of color are 
being diverted away from higher education and 
into the military, where they are found in dispro-
portionate numbers,” he said.

Ayazi said this problem is particularly visible 
at schools like Mission Bay and Lincoln, where 
Latinos and African Americans make up most of 

the ethnic demographic.
“None of the coursework and time spent 

in military training programs satisfies univer-
sity admission requirements,” Ayazi said. “Yet 
schools like Lincoln and Mission Bay are cutting 
funding and resources from the AP/IB programs 
and diverting them to ROTC programs. We need 
programs that help these kids get into college, 
not ones that drive them away from it.”

Since its formation in 1984, Project Yano has 
advocated alternatives to military careers, listing 
various links to scholarships and financial aid 
as well as counter-recruitment information and 
brochures on its Web site.

“Many of our members are armed forces 
veterans who believe that high school students 
are getting a distorted picture of the military 
and war from recruiting ads and marketing,” 
Ayazi said.

Representatives from the Mission Bay and 
Lincoln ROTC Programs did not respond to 
multiple requests for comment.

sive institutions,” Gilbert said in an e-mail. “A 
next professional step for 
her, in my opinion, would 
be to go to an even more 
prestigious public or pri-
vate institution, for exam-
ple Berkeley, Michigan, 
Harvard, etc., or to assume 
leadership of a major uni-
versity system, like [the] 
UT system.” 

Gilbert added that 
accepting the UT position 
would be a pivotal career 
choice for Fox, entailing 
a similar amount of work 
with a higher degree of 
respectability.

“Moving from being a 
chancellor in the UC system to being chancel-
lor of the UT system is not a lateral move with 
respect to responsibility,” he said. “It’s a big 

move up.”
The UT system encompasses nine college 

campuses and six health 
institutions, and enrolls 
more than 160,000 students. 

Gilbert did not com-
ment on how Fox’s potential 
departure to Texas would 
affect UCSD, only saying 
that chancellors are replaced 
“all the time.”

The UT Office of Public 
Affairs has made no com-
ment validating the rumors. 

The UT System Board 
of Regents will soon con-
duct a national search for a 
new chancellor, the details 
of which have yet to be 
announced.

OPINION
MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2008MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2008

With A.S. Elections hap-pening this week there will no doubt be booths 
of extra-energetic campus politicians 
out on Library Walk trying to per-
suade apathetic passersby to vote. 
But why should you? Almost all of 
this year’s slots are uncontested, and 
signing onto TritonLink will surely 

take at least two minutes of your oh-
so-valuable second-week time — at 
this stressful point in the quarter 
you obviously need every precious 
second so you can walk to class early 
or reorganize your volumes of chem-
istry notes. 

Forget that this incoming council 
will be responsible for things like 
allotting funding to your student 
organizations, determining the future 
of the Sun God Festival and propos-
ing an inevitable fee referendum next 
year, the quick electronic voting pro-
cess definitely isn’t worth your time. 

I, for one, love paying hundreds of 
dollars to support a handful of athletes 
with entitlement complexes. Yep, vot-
ing in last year’s fee referendum was 
so unimportant to half the student 
body that now every undergraduate 
has to pay for a few kids’ hobby. I sure 

wish I could get other people to fund 
my leisurely pursuits; maybe I should 
lobby the A.S. Council for that.

I’m also excited to see my fee 
money being spent on the personal 
interests of incoming council mem-
bers who, lazy from lack of com-
petition, have made only a cursory 
effort to connect with students and 
are poised to work on projects that 
interest them, rather than their con-
stituents. Many of the candidates who 
met with the Guardian last week said 
they were running to essentially gain 
power and resources for their exist-
ing priorities — be it funding for 
their club or bringing fair-trade food 
to the dining commons. And while 
that may provide students with some 
nice perks, I’m positive that the aver-
age student has a different idea of 
what they’d like to see changed on 
campus.

But if we don’t participate in 
the political process, how are stu-
dent politicians supposed to address 
our concerns? Asking candidates in 
an uncontested race to pull a Mike 
Hirshman and work 16-hour days 
for two weeks speaking with stu-
dents about what they’d like to see in 
UCSD’s future just isn’t realistic. 

If we want a council that will work 
for us — or at least help us avoid pay-
ing even more money for relatively 
little gain — we need to take a stand 
in the loudest, the clearest and luckily 
the simplest way we can: by casting 
our TritonLink votes.

to establish a mandate going into 
next year.

The legacy that SV! has estab-
lished through two presidents 
— this year’s Marco Murillo and 
Harry Khanna before that — will 
hopefully solidly evolve into the 
student movement the slate has 
aimed to start since its founding 
in 2006. Make no mistake, there 
are glimmers of progress across 
campus: students are gaining a 
foothold in the school’s infra-
structure as the institution itself 
is growing.

But fundamentally, students 
still lack power over their own 
programs, events and angles of 
student life. This is a reality that 
Bean understands and smartly 
makes the foundation of her cam-
paign. The amount of frustration 
and aggravation she expresses 
with unproductive and dispirited 
relations with administrators is 
well placed, and gives her the fire 
the campus will need to propa-
gate student agendas and increase 
student profiles.

But to move forward, Bean 
pragmatically realizes her many 
obstacles.  First she must clean 
house within the council, ironing 
out undefined and cloudy por-
tions of Khanna’s restructuring 
in 2006. Moving onto a stage 
where she can define the function 
of senators, who this year were 
criticized for being effecting little

change on campus, will mark an 
early — and difficult — point in 
her presidency.

Bean understands students’ 
obstacles at a nuanced level, and 
will hopefully execute nuanced 
plans of improvement. Many of 
her strategies are sensible. 

Development of student power 
means extending students’ knowl-

edge base. Bean’s plan to establish 
a transition program will ease 
senators into the campus’ politi-
cal process and offer them the 
institutional knowledge to coor-
dinate and design efforts to better 
the students’ world. As it stands, 
student politicians are woefully 
misinformed and painfully unco-
ordinated. The result is an impo-
tent student body, ignorant to the 
nature of their world and power-
less to change it.

But the problem goes beyond 

ignorant students. Bean is quick 
to point out that administrators’ 
ignorance of the student plight 
is equally damaging to this cam-
pus. Her tales of administrators’ 
outright disregard for students’ 
opinions or worth were alarm-
ing. Students are not only lacking 
support, but are being deterred 
from progress.  

The mounting cost of college 
is just one sad angle; students 
are being continually strapped 
with fees at UCSD, last year with 
the athletics fee referendum and 
next year with an events-related 
fee increase. Bean is intent on 
changing this base indifference to 
students, and the problem rightly 
takes priority.

STUDENT VOICE!
Chief of Staff, Student Life Office • Revelle College Senator • Chair, Sixth/Revelle Festival

A s leader of the department that oversees some of the services, events and entertainment sources most relatable to students, the A.S. vice president 
of student life retains a sound amount of importance. 

This means Darryl Nousome would have to keep 
watch over the rebirth of the Sun God Festival. In its first 
run in a new format, students will be looking to Nousome 
to accurately gauge reactions to the changes and adjust 
accordingly. Weak leadership will damage festival plan-
ning to the level it saw at the beginning of the year, when 
administrators were spearing students for the glaring 
mishandling of last year’s festival. The injury is already 
rearing its head, with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue rejecting a request for added security funds. 

The message is clear: administrators plan to lay Sun 
God’s problems at students’ doorsteps. A responsive, 
determined leader in the council’s Student Life Office 
will be able to provide event programmers with the 
resources they need and advocate student interests in the 

fight against administrators to preserve the festival’s core 
ideals.

Programming is certainly one of Nousome’s priorities, 
as he highlights Sun God and Bear Gardens as lynchpins 
in the campus environment. He also wants to beef up the 
programming staff by adding a senior event coordinator, 
a good move if the council wants to manage the increas-
ingly bulky department.

Nousome will also oversee committee appointments, 
one of this school’s most precious political tools for stu-
dents. His work inside the office as A.S. President Donna 
Bean’s chief of staff enlightened him on the committees’ 
crucial use; they are the battleground where students 
press their rights in any number of areas from transporta-
tion to free speech. Careful scrutiny of these committees’ 
works will allow the Student Life leader to better steer the 
direction of student interests.

STUDENT VOICE!
Campus Organizing Director, External Affairs Office • Member, Student Worker Collective

A lthough she is running unopposed, Lisa Chen’s extensive lobbying experience warrants her the position of A.S. vice president of external affairs, 
a quintessential link between student interests and those of 
local, state and national legislators.

A veteran UC Students Association member who has 
personally met with several high-profile politicians to speak 
about topics ranging from student fees to mini-dorms to 
outreach and retention, Chen sensibly advocates building 
more student internships within the external affairs office in 
an effort to maximize the office’s potential.

Of major importance next year will be the office’s goal to 
register 4,000 new student voters in time for the November 
presidential election, a task Chen is more than ready to han-
dle, considering her commitment to student empowerment. 

But perhaps more importantly, Chen is in a unique posi-
tion to further develop the external affairs office’s relationship 
with the relatively new Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service, a student-run organization dedicated 

to outreach and retention efforts that was created after stu-
dents passed a referendum last year. 

Chen, who said that persuading Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox (currently the only UC chancellor not to do so) to match 
funds for student-initiated outreach projects is one of her 
major goals, is no stranger to higher education accessibility 
issues; she helped lead an 80-member UCSD delegation to 
the annual Students of Color Conference this year and has 
been a very vocal proponent of the Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act.

In an effort to improve the external affairs office’s visibility 
to the average student, Chen said that she would make engag-
ing students one-on-one on Library Walk and at campus 
events such as Bear Gardens a top priority. Though rather 
lofty to expect that she will be able to meet with enough 
students to make a dent in student apathy at UCSD, at least 
Chen is willing to try.

STUDENT VOICE!
Chief of Staff, Finance and Resources Office • Member, Funding Taskforce Committee

The all-campus senator race started with 11 hopefuls in the ring, but after three candi-
dates threw in the towel the eight slots 
became — like the top four offices 
— unfortunately uncontested. 

Competition makes every can-
didate work harder, but with noth-
ing driving these contenders they’ve 
proved regrettably status quo. And 
though a few bright stars stand out 
in the pack, it’s disappointing to see 
this motley crew have their positions 
handed to them.

Babek Etesami, Jesse Cabanas and 
Meghan Clair — ever the responsible Meghan Clair — ever the responsible Meghan Clair
leaders — didn’t even bother meeting 
with the Guardian to discuss their 
plans for the future. Meanwhile, the 
other five candidates appeared careful 
and slate-positioned: each addressing a 
different node of campus, though each 
with significant weaknesses.

Possibly the weakest candidate, 
Devapratim Sarma, is strictly inter-
ested in funding for student organiza-
tions, particularly, funding for cultural 
organizations and those he is person-
ally involved with. Students who par-
ticipate in cultural orgs determine a 
lot about campus politics; they are 
often the loudest and most active sec-
tor of campus, and Student Voice! is 
intimately linked with their causes. So 
it’s to be expected that they would be a 
little overrepresented on council. But 
Sarma, who has no council experience, 
threatens to push the favoritism too far. 
Student org funding looks to be a hot 
issue next year, and while this board 
would love to see all groups funded to 
the fullest, the reality is that the council 
is operating on a limited budget and 
incoming members should be ready to 
govern with the best interests of stu-
dents — not themselves — in mind. 

Covering SV!’s commuter constitu-
ency is Emily Chi who, while knowing Emily Chi who, while knowing Emily Chi
commuters’ issues in and out, remains 
sadly single-minded. Fortunately for 
students, commuters make up a giant 
bloc of the population and their needs 
deserve appropriate attention. With 
a history of rallying for commuter 
interests, Chi has the experience in her 
field to go head-to-head with obsti-
nate administrators. She just needs to 
reconnect with her constituency; she 
plans to connect commuters by meet-
ing with the leaders of various com-
muter boards, when instead she should 
cut out the middle man, step out of 
her office and strive to reach out to 
students directly.

Natalie Fowler brings possibly the Natalie Fowler brings possibly the Natalie Fowler
most applicable experience to the table; 
though never working on the A.S. 
Council she currently serves on the 
Sixth College Council. Because she’s 

already involved with student govern-
ment, her perspective is unique from 
the other candidates: Fowler wants to 
improve campus not by creating new 
resources, but by connecting students 
with already existing ones. But she 
unfortunately also represents a weath-
ered, complacent side of the council 
that next year’s bunch should work to 
overcome. She was unable to speak 
about Sixth College activities that 
didn’t directly fall beneath her posi-
tion, and her concept of senator duties 
is limited to individual projects, her 
ideas for which are uninspired at best. 
While this semi-veteran should bring 
some interesting goals to council, her 
approach still needs some help.

Handling SV!’s environmental-
sustainability and fair-trade interests 
is Chris Westling, who seems well-
informed and ready to fight fiercely 
for his cause. Though he lacks council 

experience, he has already worked in 
depth on environmental-themed proj-
ects and has an appropriate under-
standing of UCSD’s bureaucracy. 
Another strength is Westling’s plans 
to incorporate eco-friendly options 
across university departments. The 
only problem? Westling admits that all 
his future projects will be extensions 
of his current work — this means 
that as senator he won’t necessarily be 
taking students’ needs into account. 
And while environmental sustainabil-
ity is definitely important, only a small 
group of students would choose this as 
their absolute top priority.

In an unusual twist Garron 
Engstrom, a virtual no name (he has 
no council or committee experience), 
appears to be the most competent 
candidate. While he lacks specific pro-

See SENATORS, page 6

Running unopposed, Naasir Lakhani is likely to be next year’s A.S. vice president of finance and resources. But while the current all-campus senator 
and A.S. Finance Office chief of staff will have big shoes 
to fill — Vice President of Finance and Resources Sarah 
Chang is the first to hold her office after a massive constitu-
tional restructuring and helped lead the council efficiently 
despite the transitional year — and unfortunately his his-
tory on the council this year doesn’t necessarily prove he’s 
ready to meet the high-set bar.

His council experience is undeniable and when asked 
about double dipping — a practice of double-funding 
organizations that the council is continually working to 
avoid — Lakhani said the funding process is completely 
objective and the council’s checks and balances stop this 
from happening.

But Lakhani is guilty of attempting this very offense. 
“The Writing’s on the Wall,” a recent event hosted by 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan and the 

Muslim Student Association, had already received fund-
ing when Lakhani attempted to provide more money for 
the event under the guise of his senator’s project. After 
some debate the council allotted the organizations fur-
ther funding from a different area of the budget. Lakhani 
defended his actions by saying he was only trying to 
bring greater council attention to the important event, 
but this situation is inherently subjective. Would another 
organization’s event have received this second-consider-
ation funding? No. Does that mean other events aren’t as 
important? Certainly not.

Students need someone they can trust handling their 
fees. Still, his understanding of the position’s responsibili-
ties and the council’s inner workings is clear. The election 
is full of new faces and it will serve the incoming council 
well to have a few veterans leading the pack. This board 
just hopes Lakhani is ready to leave his past behind and 
serve his constituents in the most efficient and fair way 
possible.

cess know-how, he shows an impres-
sive understanding of the council’s 
various layers and rightfully realizes 
that a senator’s dedication to and 
participation in committee work is 
more important than the sporadic and 
ill-defined senators’ projects. An all-
campus senator should be concerned 
with students’ interests in all of their 
decisions, not just while completing 
a few projects. And though he, like 

many others, runs the risk of unfairly 
funding pet projects, he is the only 
candidate who truly understands the 
job as one of civic service. 

Uneven — and some blatantly 
weak — on their own, all of the candi-
dates contribute something different 
to the race. This board just hopes they 
can bring the best out of one another 
and let go of their personal interests 
to best support the student body they 
will serve.

Nousome also understands that 
publicizing these committees is not 
enough. Members must be capable 
and knowledgable about the issues at 
hand; they must be the best possible 
instruments for the student voice. 
If representatives are still not able 
to institutionalize student interests,

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

D id you do your pet rock proj-ect yet?” Eric Obana, a Sixth College junior, asked as he 
flipped through a pile of paperwork 
including a slightly crumpled grading 
progress report, a stained class project 
outline and a well-worn homework 
planner.

“No, I don’t have a pet rock,” 12-
year-old Alex Castillo said noncha-
lantly. “That’s for babies, man.” He 
reached into his oversized black back-
pack hidden beneath the lunch table. 
“Hey, do you want a juice box?”

Obana skeptically eyed the concen-
trated fruit drink, paperwork still in 
hand. “Where did you get all of those 
from?”

“I’ve got a little refrigerator in my 
room now, and I put some of these 
drinks in there,” Castillo said. “Like 
how you have in college, right?” 

Obana laughed and shook his head. 
“Yeah man, like in college.” He reached 
out his hand. “I’ll take one of those, 
too.”

Obana and Castillo are two of 
the 28 participants in the Friends 
Understanding Needs mentor program, 
which joins UCSD students with sixth-
grade students from Muirlands Middle 
School, located in the middle of down-
town La Jolla. Part of the Associated 
Students Volunteer Connection, 
F.U.N. is one of six year-long volun-
teer programs that work through the 
university to provide academic and 
emotional support to local elemen-
tary, middle and high school students, 
mentally disabled peers, or senior cit-
izens. Unlike the other programs, 
however, F.U.N. serves 11- and 
12-year-old students 
enrolled in 

Advancement via Individual 
Determination classes, offering one-
on-one mentoring to motivate high-
achieving students and improve social 
skills.

“Some of the service is academic, 
because the students are involved in 
the A.V.I.D. class,” Sixth College senior 
and F.U.N codirector Dianna Delima 
said. “Mostly, we have students who 
have family troubles, friends their age 
not really understanding their prob-
lems, and a few even had behavioral 
issues where they ditched school or 
caused problems in class. So having 
that mature, sympathetic friend there 
really boosts their confidence.” 

Since its inception in 1996, F.U.N. 
has connected more than 500 “at-risk” 
middle school students — most of 
whom are the first of their family to 
attend college — with UCSD men-
tors who advise and guide the sixth 
graders toward the possibility of aca-
demic achievement past high school. 
John Muir college junior and F.U.N. 
Codirector Rita Kreig said the pro-
gram was successful because of its 
responsive social environment.

“My mentee just needed someone to 
tell her it was okay to study, and that 
it was cool to get good grades,” 
Kreig said. “Sixth grade is a 
difficult transitioning time 
for any student, but if 
we can tell them, 
‘Hey, I’ve been 
through all 
t h i s 

too,’ then they know they can relate 
to us.” 

In order to apply for the pro-
gram, sixth grade students complete 
a brief questionnaire in November 
explaining their likes and dislikes 
(including their favorite color), 
personal family background 
and their reasons for request-
ing a mentor. Julie Latta, the 
A.V.I.D. program instructor, 
then reviews the surveys 
and decides which students 
would benefit from the

ANDREW RUIZ/GUARDIAN
Idol statues stand out from the rows of mystic arts 
and spiritual guidance books at Controversial Bookstore. 

Controversial Bookstore, located in the newly renovated heart of Hillcrest, is ideal for anyone seek-
ing spiritual guidance and enlightenment. 
The store is a “new-age” incarnate from the 
moment one sets foot in the door — both 
tranquil melodies and the faint scent of 
candles and incense lure customers to wan-
der past the many bookshelves. Long store-
front windows bring in streams of light that 
illuminate every corner of the store, creating 
an aura of warmth. This feeling is nur-
tured by shop caretakers Claudia and Doug, 
who make sure to greet customers with “Hi 
there!” before helping them peruse the wall-
to-wall bookshelves.

With more than 25,000 titles in circula-
tion related to the mystic arts, the store’s book 
collection has something for both those curi-
ous about the supernatural and the spiritu-
ally seasoned. Sections range from eerie topics 
like UFO studies and witchcraft to American 
Indian Shamanism. If you are interested in 
the magical prowess of the homosexual com-
munity, there is a book on gay witchcraft. If you 
have the bizarre urge to know which planets 
influence your pet’s moods, there is a book 
about cat astrology. And if in the off-chance you 
can’t find the particular book you are looking 
for, the store owners are happy to place a special 
order for you. 

But this shop is more than a bookstore. In 
addition to an eclectic selection of magazines and 
greeting cards, Controversial Bookstore sells an 
array of hand-crafted trinkets like sari bags, leather 
medicine pouches, silver jewelry, various miniature 
idol statues and gems and crystals. These knick-
knacks make their way to Controversial Bookstore 
from all over the country, peddled by nomadic mer-
chants who sometimes visit only once or twice a year. 
True spiritual guidance beyond the tangible comes in 
the form of daily psychic readings, held in a cozy room 

at the back of the store. Controversial Bookstore also 
hosts specialized weekend events like book signings and 

craft workshops that teach you how to create your own 
sacred altar or life treasure map inspired by one mentioned 

in the book “The Secret.”
If the price of new books seems too steep, the store carries 

a decent selection of used books starting as low as $6.95. It also 
offers a rewards program where you save $10 when you accu-

mulate $100 in purchases before tax. Behind the store there is a 
convenient parking lot, which will save you the trouble of looking 

for a spot on the very crowded University Avenue. 
Still as quirky as when it started in 1963, Controversial Bookstore 

is an uncensored literary experience worth trying.

of bed and ready for the events 
of the day. It didn’t hit me until I 
was halfway through the song that 
today was in fact Sunday, and I was 
preparing to meet thousands of 
protestors in Midan Tahrir, which 
means Liberation Square, in the 
heart of downtown Cairo.  

The strike 
began with an 
announcement 
by a reported 
25,000 employees 
of a Textile plant 
in Mahalla, a 
suburb of Cairo. 
They announced 
they would not come into work on 
April 6 to protest the rising price of 
food amid stagnant wages.

The strike turned national 
as announcements and word of 
mouth, along with the creation of a 
Facebook event and mass text mes-
sages, called for citizens to refrain 
from making purchases, going to 
work and opening their shops. 
Later developments called for 
peaceful protests and mass march-
es descending on Tahrir square. 
Everyone was asked to wear black 
and to be on scene by 2 p.m.

Many students at the American 
University of Cairo, both local 
and international, were eager for 
Sunday, some because they would 
be able to miss classes and others 
because they expected to witness 
history.

Mariella Goett, a John Muir 
College junior, chose a vantage 
point on the roof of the Palace 
Building in the Main AUC campus 
with several other students. They 
could see the tight groupings of 
riot police surrounding the square, 

the heavy, army-green trucks that 
transported the troops and the 
police covering the surrounding 
rooftops.

Just after noon, as the Kaiser 
Chiefs’ “I Predict a Riot” sounded 
off from my computer speakers, 
Goett texted me with an update: 
“No sign of activity yet,” it read. 
Nevertheless, I wasn’t disappointed. 
Like many others, I had heard the 
grumblings over Egypt’s economic 
situation; I knew of the brewing dis-

content among 
Egypt’s masses. 
I expected angry 
protests and peo-
ple taking to the 
streets demand-
ing support and 
equal rights.

On Saturday, 
April 5, Egypt’s Interior Ministry 
announced that it would take firm 
action against anyone participat-
ing, disrupting government busi-
ness or illegally gathering. Despite 
the threat, most students were sure 
Egypt was ready for such a revolu-
tionary move. Mohammed Rahmo, 
a Jordanian-Egyptian now living 
in Cairo, was less convinced than 
many studying at AUC.

“Nothing is going to happen,” is 
all he had to say on the subject.

Just before 1 p.m. I looked out 
my window into the alley below, 
and the usual crowd was hovering 
around the government bread out-
let, but in much smaller groups than 
usual, and the air was thick with 
sand. The second of the Khamseen 
sandstorms, a yearly occurrence 
that lasts around 50 days through 
April and May, was descending 
on Cairo. Everything outside was 
blanketed by sepia-colored desert; 
the streets were quiet, promising. 

As Earl Warren College senior 
Wesley Horne and I headed out of 
the apartment we could still hear the 

lines of the Beatles’ “Revolution.” 
Goett texted me again: “Still noth-
ing.” 

I separated from the group and 
headed through the downtown 
streets, snapping photos of the 
sandstorm and wondering when I 
might encounter the crowds head-
ing to Tahrir. Eventually reaching 
the square I passed the tight, fidg-
ety and bored-looking formations 
of riot police, and the heavy, army-
green trucks filled with slouch-
ing soldiers and saw the police 
parading uselessly along the roof-

tops. Still, there was no protest, no 
crowd. 

Making my way toward the Nile 
River and along the bridge where 
crowds would be crossing, I called 
my fellow student journalists seek-
ing word of something, anything. 
The reply was the same: “There’s 
nothing happening, it’s quiet.”

I sent a text message asking 
about the lull to AUC political sci-
ence professor Heba Raouf, whose 
connections and personal influence 
among Egypt’s activists and politi-
cians seem to know no bounds. Her 

response: “No idea.”
In Tahrir the situation was 

unchanged. Small, meager crowds 
of 20 or less stood quietly behind 
police in riot gear. Both groups 
watched tourists and shoppers 
lackadaisically as they passed. The 
slight decline in the crowds of the 
normally bustling square and sur-
rounding streets could either be 
attributed to the strike, or to the 
thickening brownish air.

By 2 p.m. the crowds had been

tions to the mentors, who personally 
choose which student they feel they 
could best help.

“I look for students who have the 
most potential, who may be disad-
vantaged economically and have to 
take the bus to school, but really kids 
who are ‘diamonds in the rough,’” 
Latta said. 

Mentors and their students meet 
weekly for approximately two hours 
after school at the Muirlands cam-
pus, reviewing homework and any 
problems students may have with 
their teachers or peers before engag-
ing in a number of social activities, 
including playing sports or board 
games, walking to the beach and 
shopping in La Jolla Village. 

“I can hear the kids talking some-
times after school, and it seems the 
[sixth-grade] students always want 
to talk about dating, makeup, sports 
or fashion,” Latta said. “As much as 
we seek to motivate and inspire the 
kids academically, they are learning 
cultural and social things from the 
mentors too.”

While interaction is mainly 
between the mentors and students, 
Latta often recommends that the men-
tors acquaint themselves with other 
adults in the student’s life in order to 
better facilitate communication. 

Mentors generally receive feed-
back from teachers from progress 
reports that underline academic con-
cerns the mentors should address. 
Once they are paired, Latta also pro-
vides the teams with a brief orienta-
tion that offers tips for effective and 
accommodating relationships.

“I tell the students to … be a hip, 
young, exciting grown-up,” Latta 
said. “Be what these kids want to 
become, not what they are already. 
Be motivational, but don’t preach 
to them. But most importantly, be 
that special person who consistently 
comes to hang out and be there for 
the kids.” 

Some mentors make such a 
strong connection with their stu-
dents that they stay in touch past 
the required six-month length of 
the program, continuing their cor-
respondence well into the students’ 
high school years.

“A few years ago, one pair got 
along really well and the mentor 
would visit the student and her fam-
ily on the weekends, even after the 
student had progressed to the sev-
enth, eighth grade,” Latta said. “The 
mentor called it her ‘San Diego fam-
ily’, which must have helped since 
she herself was so far from home.”

While the UCSD students act 
as mentors, Kreig believes that she 
learned more about herself and the 
community through the eyes of her 
sixth-grade mentee. 

“These kids have lived in San 
Diego for all their lives, and they 
know a lot about the community 
— even how to take all the different 
buses — that would have taken me 
a few years to learn,” she said. “We 
become so consumed with college 
and classes, but they show you that 
worrying all the time doesn’t help 
you grow.” 

The student directors organize 
quarterly field trips to the San Diego 
Zoo or SeaWorld that all students and 
mentors attend together, in addition 
to Sports Day, a day-long event of 
relay and athletic games, and College 
Day, a tour of the UCSD campus that 
prompts students to explore the pos-
sibility of attending a four-year uni-
versity. But Kreig finds that the most 
memorable moments come from the 
everyday experiences. 

“It’s so exciting, the first time the 
students open up to you, when they 
start showing you off to all their 
friends and teachers,” she said. “You 
feel like a rock star, and they feel so 
special having you there.”

sent away from the rooftops of 
AUC and the heavy, army-green 
trucks were slowly filling with more 
slouching soldiers. 

In Mahalla, police had arrest-
ed more than 600 protesters 
and detained 300 more activists 
throughout the morning. Zeinobia, 
an Egyptian blogger, reported that 
well-known activist Mohammed 
Abd El-Quds was arrested while 
buying a newspaper downtown.

Just after 5 p.m., the police 
started to clear the streets and 
vacate Midan Talat Harb and Tahrir 
square. No mass protests had taken 
place. Violence, aside from a glass 
bottle and tear gas exchange at 
Mahallah,  was unseen. Voices were 
unheard. But the protest’s concept 
and idea  — the meaning behind it  
— remained.

I wandered home from the 
streets of Cairo, disappointed that 
the protest had failed to achieve 
instant gratification. Passant 
Rabie, an AUC senior and journal-
ism major, changed her status on 
Facebook to: “Passant Rabie is so 
disappointed in Egyptians today! 
What happened to the nationwide 
protest?!”

A text message from Raouf made 
me realize that something had hap-
pened today, something revolu-
tionary and powerful, something 

unheard of in Egypt. At 9:20 p.m. 
she sent me a message explaining 
what happened today. 

“This is the first time average 
people know and ask about an act 
of disobedience,” she wrote. “Even 
if symbolic and broadly defined in 
text messages and word of mouth 
circulation. [It] does not matter if 
they ‘did’ anything, but the curios-
ity and interest is growing. This is 
new and it is a sign of future action 
to come.”

Egyptians may have stayed in 
their homes because of the sand-
storms, because of the strike or 
even because of the threats of 
police action. But they were aware 
of a cause, they wished to make a 
difference and the daunting pres-
ence of black uniformed guards in 
riot gear covering the streets was a 
testament to the seriousness with 
which the government read such 
desires.

Egypt may not have changed 
in a day, but it’s changing. My 
fellow AUC students and I were 
disappointed we didn’t witness his-
tory, but, in a way, we did. And at 
the end of the day, the movement 
was a success in the eyes of many 
— because those eyes are open.

MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

Stanford cruised to the win. Ring said 
Stanford had UCSD well scouted and 
kept the team from finding a rhythm.

“They knew where we hit and how 
to block us and we just never got any-
thing going,” he said. “We stepped up 
in game two and put ourselves in a 
position to win but made some poor 
plays that really have been routine for 
us at home.”

The Tritons had more success 
against the Tigers as they survived a 
thrilling marathon match that featured 
56 ties and 21 lead changes. The game 
lasted almost three hours and took all 
five games to be decided, with UCSD 
coming from behind to win, 30-26, 28-
30, 38-40, 30-26, 20-18.

Hardy, sophomore outside hitter 
Jason Spangler and sophomore oppo-
site Frank Fritsch all sent down over 20 
kills while junior libero Eric Leserman 
added 15 digs to bring his total on 
the year to 282, breaking the all-time 
single-season mark he set last season. 

The Tritons held a late 22-21 lead 

before a small Tiger run put Pacific in 
the lead 25-24. Hardy tallied one of his 
23 kills to tie the match and sophomore 
middle blocker Gerald Houseman 
closed the game with an ace. 

Although Pacific led most of game 
two, the Tritons were able to pull close 
on multiple occasions. UCSD trailed 
22-27 but chipped away at the Tiger 
lead, closing it to a one-point deficit by 
way of a Fritsch kill and Tiger error. The 
late push by UCSD fell short and Pacific 
hung on to win the game.

The Tritons earned the first game 
point of game three at 29-28 before 
both teams traded sideouts, exponen-
tially intensifying the game as it wore 
on. UCSD finally faltered with the game 
still tied at 38, as a service error and 
attack error ended one of the Tritons’ 
longest games this season and led to a 
must-win game four.

The Tritons played more cohesively, 
earning an early two-point advantage 
and never relinquishing it. Fritsch led 
the way , giving the Tritons a four-point 
lead, 24-20, and putting down two kills 

to pick up the crucial win.
Both teams had game points in the 

decisive fifth game, but UCSD came 
away with the win. Down 8-10, Pacific 
went on a 4-1 run to steal the lead 12-
11. The teams were tied three more 
times before the Tigers got a match 
point. Spangler kept the Tritons alive 
with a kill and the two teams tied 
another three times before UCSD got 
its chance at a match point. The Tritons 
capitalized with a Houseman block and 
freshman setter Phil Bannan to shut 
down the Tigers for the match winner. 

Ring said the turnaround point in 
the match was in game three when 
Leserman dove over the scorer’s table 
and got the ball back in play.

“I think that really got our team 
back on track,” he said. “It got the team 
to play more intensely and kept us 
fighting in what was the longest match 
I have ever been a part of here at UCSD. 
The fans got their money’s worth.”

With the Tritons’ goalie out, the Aztecs 
were able score on the open goal to put 
UCSD in a 4-1 hole at halftime. 

After being held scoreless in the 
second quarter, the Tritons needed a 
score to stay in the game. Hermann, 
using a pass from senior attacker 
Elizabeth Hahn, gave UCSD that goal 
and cut the Aztecs’ lead to 4-2. After 
SDSU took advantage of another 
six-on-five opportunity, the Tritons 
responded when senior two-meter 
Judy Emaus scored 
a backhand goal 
from the set. A lob 
score from junior 
attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer cut 
the lead to one at 
5-4 with 1:21 left in 
the third quarter. 

“Our goal in 
the game was to 
show [San Diego] 
State that we were 
contenders and 
scare them a little,” 
Hermann said. “It 
was a big game, and 
we haven’t won the Harper Cup in a 
while.”

With the Aztecs in danger of a 
rare loss to UCSD, they answered 
back in the first possession of the 
fourth quarter, powering a nearside 
shot through the goal to take a 6-
4 lead. The game was dominated 
by defense until Emaus scored her 
second goal on a rollout from the 
two-meter with 49 seconds left. The 
Tritons had an opportunity to tie the 
game and send it into overtime, but 
an errant pass gave the Aztecs posses-
sion with 10 seconds left in the game 
and sealed the win for SDSU. 

“We played at a much higher level 
than we have been and were intense 
for all four quarters,” Hermann said. 

“We fought hard, kept going and came 
together as a team.”

UCSD started the day with a con-
vincing 10-1 victory over Chapman 
University, earning the Tritons their 
15th victory of the season. 

“It’s always tough playing a team 
that’s not very good because you don’t 
want to play down to their level,” head 
coach Larry Sanders said. “I think 
that we played well and used it as a 
warmup for our second game.”

The Tritons have just three games 
left before the 
Western Water 
Polo Association 
Championships 
on April 25 
through April 27. 
Two out of the 
next three con-
tests will come 
against ranked 
o p p o n e n t s 
— the first com-
ing against No. 
4 University of 
Hawaii on April 
9. The Tritons’ 
goal is to win 

the WWPA championships but, with 
many teams ahead of them in the 
WWPA standings, taking the title will 
not be easy.

“Our goal is to be focused and 
intense throughout our games,” 
Sanders said. “We believe that if we 
shoot 40 to 50 percent on our six-on-
five opportunities than we are going to 
win games. We’re going to try to work 
on that and get better at it.”

The Tritons’ next game against No. 
4 University of Hawaii will be at home 
before the Tritons travel to Los Angeles 
to take on No. 11 Loyola Marymount 
University on April 12.

Sloshball League Play Opens With Upset
For G-Team members, annual tra-

ditions include the Welcome Week edi-
tion, the Student Survival Guide, Senior 
Sendoffs and the sloshball game that 
pits the G-Team against the Marsupials 
in the battle of newspapers, a game that 
for eons has ended in blowout victories 
for the unofficial campus newspaper.

But all dynasties must come to an 
end and on April 5, the Marsupial’s did 
in a shitshow known as sloshball. The 
historic victory did not come easily, as 
the inbred Marsupials started reverting 
to their usual cheap tactics when the 
G-Team took a 3-0 lead after the first 
inning. After a second-inning stretch 
chicken break at the National Guard 
picnic, the Marsupial team continued 
to swing a feeble bat and resorted to 
tackling and Ty Cobb-like tactics as the 
G-Team extended  its lead to 8-1. After 

playing with and losing to these beasts 
for years, the veterans rallied the rook-
ies to start working together to beat the 
Marsupials at their own game. 

As the keg of piss-warm pale ale 
dwindled to half full, the G-Team 
was cruising with a 17-6 lead, which 
was taking its toll on the losing team’s 
morale and led to more belligerent 
tempers flaring. Amongst the fisticuffs 
and profanity, the Marsupial team 
somehow tied the game at 17 with just 
a few drinks left to go at second base 
before the game was called.

With those last few sandy, cracked 
and spiked party cups, the G-Team 
scored four runs in the final inning by 
schooling seventh-year senior, Porter’s 
Pub bartender and Marsupial catcher 
Grizzly Adams with jukes and tackles 
at home plate. Refusing to admit defeat, 

the Marsupial’s 
Editor-in-Chief — a 
vicious beer wench 
who wouldn’t pick 
up a bat all game — 
screamed in shame 
as the G-Team cel-
ebrated the upset on 
the mound.

Thanks to a 
defense that turned 
three double plays, 
an offense that 
always found the 
hole between defend-
ers and a drinkoff crew that held its 
own with Adams and the rest of the 
Marsupials, the G-Team pulled off the 
impossible. With the win, the Dream 
Team will advance to the second round 
to face either KSTD or a TBA squad.

“Our goal in the game was to show [San Diego] State that we were contenders and 
scare them a little.”

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The Tritons 
reached the 10-win mark for the first 
time in over a decade with their victory 
over the University of Pacific on April 5 
after falling to No. 8 Stanford University 
in on April 4. UCSD improved its overall 
record to 10-17, moving to 6-14 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

While not playoff bound, head 
coach Kevin Ring said his Tritons still 
have goals they are trying to achieve.

“It is important for us to continue 
practicing hard because opponents 
aren’t taking us lightly,” he said. “They’re 
battling for playoff positioning and we 
see the challenge as an opportunity to 
go into someone else’s gym and win.”

Besides their chance to pull off a win 
in the second game, the Tritons were 
outplayed by the Cardinal throughout 
the match, falling in straight sets, 30-20, 
35-33, 30-20. 

Stanford jumped out to an early lead 
in game one before freshman middle 
blocker Calvin Ross pulled the Tritons 
to within three at 18-15. However, a 9-2 
Cardinal run sealed the game-one win.

With game two tied at 20, Stanford 
went on a 5-1 run to open up a four-
point advantage. The Tritons battled 
back, knotting it up at 26 after fresh-
man outside hitter Shane Veiga’s kill 
and sophomore libero and serving spe-
cialist Erik Sierks gave the Tritons a 
one-point cushion with an ace. After 
Stanford earned a game point up 29-27, 
freshman middle blocker Tyler Kern 
tallied a kill and block to tie the game 
again. Senior outside hitter Russ Hardy 
gave the Tritons a game point but the 
Cardinal stifled any UCSD threat, stav-
ing off two game points and closing out 
game two with three straight kills.

Game three was all Cardinal, as the 
Tritons couldn’t put together a run and

WATER POLO — The No. 19 UCSD 
women’s water polo team has had its 
ups and downs this season, leading 
to its current 15-15 record. But one 
of its high points came in a 6-5 loss 
to No. 5 San Diego State University 
on April 5 in the Harper Cup. The 
Tritons began the day with a 10-1 
victory over Chapman University, but 
it was their loss to the Aztecs that left 
them optimistic about the remainder 
of the season.

“Over the last three weeks, we’ve 
been playing good games followed 
by bad games,” senior utility Nicole 
Hermann said. “In our game against 
San Diego State, we fought hard, 
played well and got back to how we 
started out the season.”

The Tritons were in for a chal-
lenge against the Aztecs even before 
the game started, having lost 30 of the 
40 previous games between the two 
teams. The Aztecs struck first, scoring 
an easy counterattack goal to get on 
the board. UCSD answered back on 
the next possession with a goal from 
sophomore utility Stephanie Heinrich 
to tie the score with 4:57 left in the 
quarter. SDSU utilized its speed once 
again to put away another counterat-
tack goal that gave the Aztecs a 2-1 
lead at the end of the first period.

The Tritons stepped up their tran-
sition defense in the second quarter, 
holding the Aztecs scoreless for most 
of the period. With 2:22 left before 
halftime, SDSU converted on a six-
on-five opportunity to put UCSD in 
a two-goal hole. The Tritons got some 
bad luck at the end of the half when 
senior goalkeeper Kim Hockett was 
called for a foul outside of the goal.

TRACK & FIELD — The Tritons host-
ed their annual Divisional Challenge 
on April 5, winning both the men’s 
and women’s team titles, only the sec-
ond time all season that both teams 
took first at the same meet. While the 
women breezed to their competition’s 
title with an 89-point margin of vic-
tory, the day’s most exciting news 
was the come-from-behind victory 
of the men, who narrowly edged out 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps by a score 
of 194-193. 

The Divisional Challenge is aptly 
named for the format of the compe-
tition levels at the meet. Each year 
there is supposed to be one team 
from a Division-I school, a Division-
II school, a Division-III school, a 
community college and a National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics school. UC Riverside, the 
Division-I representative, dropped 
out of the race last week, leaving 
UCSD to face off as the top com-
petitor versus Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps (Division III), Cuyamaca 
Community College and Point Loma 
Nazarene University (NAIA). 

After taking on some of the West 
Coast’s leading Division-I schools 
at the previous Cal/Nevada and 
All-Cal Championship meets, the 
Tritons then had to deal with facing 
a relatively lower level of competi-
tion, along with no longer being 
able to hide under the guise of the 
underdog team.

“At these meets, when we’re the 
top team, nothing really changes 
because you always push yourself 
as hard as you can for every race,” 
junior hurdler Jennifer Albertson 

said. “We have to know that there 
will always be people gunning for 
us. If you always assume that you’re 
going to win it becomes hard to 
improve; that is when you have to 
look at your own personal accom-
plishments and do better than you 
did the previous time, regardless of 
who your competition is.”

The Triton men have yet to post 
any national provisional marks that 
would give them direct qualifiers 
for the National Championship in 
late May, but they have started to 
place higher and higher in meets. As 
long as the team can overcome some 
recent minor injuries, it should take 
a lot of momentum into the playoffs. 
After lingering around first place for 
the majority of the meet, it looked 
as though the men would have to 
settle for second before a few late 
victories pushed them just past the 
competition. 

In only his second meet this 
season, sophomore jumper Casey 
Ryan looked in mid-season form 
by winning the high jump with a 
2.04-meter leap, just ahead of fel-
low Triton Stephen Johnson’s mark 
of 1.99 meters. Sophomore thrower 
Fred Cook’s toss of 14.62 meters in 
the shot put was more than a whole 
meter ahead of the second-place fin-
isher from Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
and easily earned him a top finish. 
Also contributing first-place points 
were senior hurdler Khalil Hooper 
in the 110-meter hurdles and junior 
distance runner Jake LeVieux in the 
800 meter. 

The top finish for the men was 
made even more impressive by the 
fact that many Tritons were either 
shelved by recent injuries or forced 
to play through them.

 “We had a lot of sick and injured 
today,” men’s coach Tony Salerno 
said. “Coming out of Cal/Nevada 
we had to rest some people and had 
to sit some people to nurse some 
injuries. We knew that Claremont 
was going to be a tough team coming 
into today, they are one of the better 
programs in Division III, that’s why 
we always invite them here.”

The UCSD women, who have 
become somewhat accustomed to 
their recent streak of dominance, 
had no problems blowing away 
their competition at the Divisional 
Challenge, wracking up victories in 
almost all events and breaking three 
school records in the process. 

The 4x100 relay team of senior 
Kayliegh Knudson, junior Katie 
Skorupa, sophomore Christine 
Merrill and freshman Kelly Fogarty 
ran the event in 47 seconds flat to set 
the all-time UCSD record by .14 sec-
onds. After setting the school record 
in the pole vault at last week’s Cal/
Nevada meet, senior Christina Sloyer 
improved her own all-time record by 
clearing 3.8 meters for first place at 
the meet and a national provisional 
mark. The third school record to fall 
on Saturday was in the 400-meter 
hurdles, where sophomore Anna Lee 
McGregor ran a 56.51.  

The Tritons will next travel on 
April 10 for the prestigious three-
day UCLA Rafer Johnson/Jackie 
Joyner Kersey Invitational in Los 
Angeles, the first major meet in a 
stretch of three straight weeks of 
intense competition leading up to 
the CCAA Conference finals that 
begin on May 1.

The junior libero had 15 digs in the 
Tritons’ five-game win against the 

University of  the Pacific on April 5, giving 
him a school record 282 kills this season.
