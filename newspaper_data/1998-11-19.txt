Preuss School Will Benefit 
From Alvarez's Leadership 

In a sure sign that the fledgling Preuss School-
fonner[y known as the Model School - is starting 
out on the right foot , Hoover High chool Principal 
Doris Alvarez has been selected as the school's first 
principal . 

The Preuss School. which wi II open its doors in fall 
1999, wi ll offer a col lege preparatory curricu lum to 
underachieving yet talented low-income students who 
would be the first in their fami ly to graduate from col-
lege. After graduating from the Preuss School, these 
students wi ll be prepared to succeed at UCSD and 
other academica lly competitive universitie~ . 

Alvarez. who was named national Principal of the 
Year in 1997, is exactly the type of innovative, expe-
rienced educator we want leading the Preuss chool 
through its formative years . 

During her I I-year tenure as principal of inner-
city Hoover High School , Alvarez helped to reduce 
dramatically the dropout rate and to develop a pow-
erful alumni association that provides the school wi th 
much-needed financial support. In addition. she insti -
tuted a public serv ice requirement for a[1 Hoover stu-
dents. 

Alvarez":' prev ious experi ence wi ll enahle her to 
help the Preuss chool hecome a model for educa-
tional excel[ence and university oLi lreach throughout 
the nation. 

We are pleased that U 0 has put so much effort 
into selecting the lirst principal or the Preuss School. 
University administrators interviewed approximately 
150 candidates from locations as di stant as Colombia 
and France. 

The concept of having a high school for under-
privileged students on campus. which has its roots in 
Marshall Provost Ceci l Lytle 's Charter choo[ 
Proposal. has not always been met with praise. In 
June 1997 , the faculty voted agai nst Lytle's proposal 
in a 362-293 mai I vote. Given the fact that the on ly 
major difference between Preuss School and the pro-
posed charter schoo l is that the Preuss school will 
teach students in grades 6 through 12 instead of 9 
through 12, we are encouraged that the Preuss School 
is being taken so seriously early on. 

As principal of the Preuss S hoot, Alvarez wi II be 
held accountable for all the school's successes and 
failures . She will he blamed for every misstep and 
praised for every accomplishment. Due to her exten-
sive experience. we are confident that she will be able 
to take it al[ in stride. As the principal of Hoover High 
chool, Alvarez has proven that she can come up 

with ingenious so lutions to everyday problems. We 
are convinced that th is ski ll will serve her we[1 as 
principal of the Preuss chool. We wish Principal 
Alvurez the best of luck in the future.

TESTING PRODUCTS ON 
ANIMALS MAKES LITTLE SENSE 
COMMENTARY: 
Inhumane tests produce 
skewed results and are of 
li ttle use to humankind 
By Andy Myrick 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Animals have been used hy humans 
for all SOrtS of purposes. We keep them 
as pets , We wtllt:h them perform in cir-
cuses. We remove their skins anu make 
them into coats. suitcases and other 
useful items. We even eat them. 

U~~ and ahuse of animal s by 
humans i~ noth ing new. This fact . 
however. d()e~ nol makl! it right. 

Of cou rse. somel i lIl e~ wc do what 
we have 10 do, Tak.: war. for example. 
War is ugly. hut s(lmetim.:~ ncce!>sary, 
The recent ~ howdown with Iraq is a 
prime cxampk' of peopk heing pre-
p(lred to do had thing~ 10 bencl-It the 
greater good , Like war. ~ometimes it i~ 
nece,sary to harm animals 10 achieve 
our goal '. A~ fell ow animals. however, 
we should appr.:ciate the su ffering that 
W() cause. 

Rarely do people ca l ani mals 
because they Ihink thai the act of 
killing a C(lW. burning its Ilesh and 
then devouring the cart:ass is appeal-
ing. Rather. 1lI ()~ t have abo decided 
thai eating meat is henelicial enough 
10 ju~ti ry the !"illing and cOI"ulllption 
of animab-.. Many peopk havc d 'ciu-
cd. upon learning the Il1dh fXb of 

~ I aught cr. that Ihe llli ~l:I'y t:a u ~ed h 
the meat imlll~try i~ too horrih l.:: to ju,-

people have Slopped l!,ltlllg meat 
oecall!,e the ha\ t: hecome C(lnvi nc~d 
that Ihcir health would he hcller on 
without it. 

When judging whether or not 
hanning anill1ab i~ jU!>lilied, it i ~ nec-
e;,;,ary III look doscl y at Ihe prm;e-
durcs (lnd their n:;,uh!>. 10 dctermine in 
what siluations these acls lIrc juslified. 

Many corporations, 
such as Avon and Liz 
Claiborne, manage to 
turn out quality 
products using mostly 
existing compounds 
without testing on 
animals, showing that 
testing on animals is 
not necessary to 
produce hlgh-quality 
goods. 

One of the most t:olllmon experi-
ments on animals is the Draize eye 
te~t. ~ Ial ed People for Ethical 
Treatlll.:nl of Animab (PETA). First , 
an animal. u~ually a rahhit , is placed in 
a vict: which immnbil l /e~ il~ head. Its 
cye" arc then lorced open and held

ing, massive deterioration and p<lssi -
hly hl indness. Animals have been 

known 10 slruggle so hard to escape 
th ai they end up breaking their own 
nech. 

One wou Id assume from looking at 
thi s horrilit: example that the sub-
stance being tesled is of profound 
importance to humans. In some cases • . 
this is arguably true, as in experiments 
for sunscreen. whit:h. by eliminating 
exposure to UV light. could perhaps 
prevent thousands or cases of skin can-
cer al the cos t of a few rabbits . 
Ho'-\> evcr in many scenarios. this test 
is not used tor sut:h substanl:es, hut 
instead to develop products that wi ll 
serve to make companies richer. 

There are many cases in which the 
nel benelit of testing on animab is 
valuahle enough to justify th.: prac-
ti ce. Lining the pockels or a corpora-
ti on's shareho lders is not one of thesc 
cases, 

Companies orten pe rform an 
interes ling tri ck on l:onsumers by 
t:Onvi ncing them that current prod-
ucts are insufficient. We' re lold how 
brand-new prod ut: ts will make our 
leeth whiter-than-whitc , give our 
clothes vibran l new t:olors and give 

u ~ the closest shav.: possibl e. While il 
may be nice to have all these benc-
lits. the ract is thai most of these 
"new and improved" products are 
unnecessary. 

While il i ~ true that developments 
;,uch a~ vitamin-enriched shampoo are 
part of th~ sy>.tem of cap i tal i~l11. i ~ il 
really nccc~~ary to torture animals 
because our faces have one too many

We could put blindfolds over

mufrs over our ears in hopes 10 stop 
the bigotry anu hate so that we will 
not sec. speak or hear the realilies

back to the days of the Beaver and 
his family. Rather, we should open 
our books and our minds to learn 
about the realities of life. 

"Hate on Campus" atlempted to 
justify whiteness by pitting color 
against while. Rather than demysti -
rying hatred and bigotry, it perpelu-
ates and wallows in ignorant:e. In 
order to break one's own ignorance 
and bigotry. olle must use knowl-

open your mind to reality. Converse

ment in response to Leventhal's 
accusations. 

"1 do not understand where Joe 
Leventhal is coming fr('m," he said 
in the statement. .. As far as I am 
aware, his criticism seems 10 stem 
more from anger than from rea l 
facts. If you ask any student orga-
nization, campus group, or A.S. 
Council member (hal I have 
worked with, Ihey will tell you that 
I do a damn good job." 

Leventhal said that Ru 's actions 
at Wedm:sday night 's meeling, his 
previous support of the Academic 
Success Program and his views of 
A.S. as a political machine are all 
examples of his incompetence. 

Leventhal said that he be li eves 
Ru promoted the Academic 
Success Program (A .S.P.) despite 
the fact that it was a poor tinancia l 
investment for the A.S. Counci I. 
A.S.P. is a newly-formed student 
organization that offers book lend-
ing and mentoring programs. 

" I r student look hack to the 
council meetings of when he first 
took offi ce. they will see (hat he 
was a sirong advocate of the 
Academic Success Program," 
Lew nthal said. " It turned out to be 
a poor linancial choice for the 
A.S." 

Ru said that he was advocating 
for A.S. linancial bylaws during the 
debate over A.s.P. 

"I advocaled for consistency of 
A.S funding policy. not for A.S.P. 
in particular." Ru said . "I believe 
that the students would approve of 
my ~lcti () ns hecause 69.2 percent of 
voters vOled for Ihe ASP program. 
It had the highest vote of approval 
of any item or person on Ihe bal-
lo\."

ASSISTANT: 
A.S. officers argue 

.. over political nature 
Continued from page 6 

Levent hal also said that he 
thinks Ru is an advocate for creat-
ing political tensions in A.S. 
Council. 

·'Pat and I have had numerous 
discussions as 10 why there has to 
be politics in the college level of 
student council ," Leventhal said. 
·'Although he has never been able 
LO give me an adequate answer. he 's 
the only member of council that 
believes that A.S. needs to he a 
political machine." 

Ru responded by sayi ng that he 
thinks the term '·political machine" 
implies too much about A.S. 

"I think Joe gives me too much 
credit in my persuasion skill s," Ru 
said. " It is nai've to say A.S. is not 
political, and I must say that many 
people besides me are political. 
Politics does not have to be nega-
tive. It is an express ion of opinion. 
I would argue that Joe is being 
'politi cal' with these public 
attacks.'·

formance. 
One of the picJ.:es that Skin and 

Bones will be performing on Satur-
day is "Plank:' in which ten slats of 
purplcheart wood arc used to devel-
op a set of melodic ideas. The com-
bination of the odd sound of the 
purplehcart wood (a kind of "tonk" 
sound) with the fad that both play-
ers are using LwO mallets in each 
hand make "Plank" very pleasing 
to the ear. It is far from si mple. 
though . as various rhythmic 
devices take place that the simpler 
melodic material tries to disguise. 
In facl. the various poly rhythms 
and mctrie modulations heing 
sounded hy eight mallets make one 
wonder how they can be doing this 
wilh just four hands. 

Another composition to be per-
formed this weekend is "Flip the 
Bird" in which anllld Charlie Park· 
er tune is re-arranged and ·'flipped'· 
around. sO that the improvised pans 
come before the hcad of the tune. 
This piece features Reed on the 

vibraphone and Longshore on the 
marimba, and it illustrates the 
many similarities, as well as the 
differences. between the instru-
ments (the same can be said for the 
pcrformers). The improvisation in 
thi s piece is both energetic and 
fluid , and things become even more 
interesting when the duo begins 
playing a bass drum, snare, and hi -
hat with their feet while still 
manipulating four mallets a piece. 

While various other pieces 
(i ncluding two new ones) will also 
be performed, one of the highlights 
of the show should be "Boom". a 
dynamic composiLion that uses a 
shared bass drum and tom-toms 
and two sets of bongos. This explo-
sive piece must be seen to be 
believed, as it J.:aptures Skin and 
Bont.!s at their most energetic - it 
must he thc drums. While one J.:an 
try to make out the interlocking 
passages, the overlapping phrases 
of differenl lengths and even more 
compliJ.:ated rhythmic devices 

("Listening Strategy # I" according 
to Longshore), it is equally enjoy-
able to use another: just sit back 
and listen to the rhythms dance. 

Skin and Bones' CD, also titled 
BUUIIl, is available at the food eo-op 
and elsewhere for $15. It features 
the title track, as well as "Plank" 
and four other compositions. Each 
unique piece, from the explosive 
drumming of "Boom" to the gen-
tle marimba sounds of "Slat-
dance", has its own panicu-
lar character, and this 
Saturday is an oppor-
tunity to see these 
up-and-coming 
musicians 
before they tin-
ish their time as

Home for Christmas IIC"._.

Need a Christmas recipe? Takc 
a gimmick concept; mix in live 
bubble gum vocalists so breathy 
they'd make Hurricane Andrew 
jealous; add some generic R&B 
beats and over IO() ullerances of the 
word "Christmas." Lct simmer in 
your CD player for an hour and 
viola! - you've made a turkey 
called HOllie for Christmas by 
NSYNC. 

To its credit. the group does a 
decent job with an a cappella ren-
dering of the classic ".0. Holy 
Night." and a low-key interpreta-
tion of "The First Noel." But 
NSYNC's original songs lack sub-
stance. using ' the typica l 
metaphors about oceans. wind. 
"two becoming one" and all the 
other corporate cheese you'd 
ex pec t from a group whose ori-
gins trace back to the "New Mick-
ey Mouse ClUb." The only thing 
they're in sync with is my stom-
ach ulcer.

Upon lirst listening to Stereo-

lah's music. one might be inclined 
to write it off as record store back-
ground music and not give it a 
chance. Those who sit themselves 
down and force themselves to listen 
to Stereo lab. however. will realize 
that there is much more to this 
band. Since they formed in 1992. 
Stereolab has continually spiced up 
the lives of many fans. 

This band is one of the few 
bands that can take influences from 
bands like the Velvet Underground 
and still rock. This album is a col-
lection that includes 25 unreleased 
and rare tracks that the band has 
recorded over t he past live years. 
Not only is it nice to linally be able 
to hear some new material from this 
group of six. it's fun to be able to 
listen to lo-li Stereolah again. Alu-
lIIinulII TLllles features Stereolah at 
their hest, a lo-Jidelity progressive 
pop band that is reinventing our 
idea of what it means to be pop.

With a unique style that blends 

the sounds of rap , ambient trance. 
pop and a splash of gospel, the 
amazing talent of this British band 
is not limited to instrumentals, 
which can include guitars, key-
boards, unique sounds of percus-
sion. strings and electronic pro-
granuning. 

All of the vocalists on SlIlIday 8 
pili are gifted with soulful. melodic 
voices . Maxi Jazz raps with 
insightful lyrics ("Pity me while 
you lie with your loverl I 'it and 
su lfer in despairl While you ruffle 
his hair. unaware of who else is 
there.") and a richness in his Ilavor-
fu l and mellow spoken voke. Rem-
iniscent of Tricky. Jazz has a ki lIer 
voice that looks you straight in the 
eye and winks at you, while mak-
ing you beg for more. 

Sister Bliss is a strong force un 
the keyhoard. demonstrating a rare 
ability to hamlonize human voice 
and electronic resonance.

R.E.M.'s previous effo rt. New 

Adventures in Hi-fi, set new stan-
dards for how a rock album should 
be judged. With it 's stunning over-
all package of eclectic gems, such 
an amazing record is very difticult 
to follow up. R.E.M., however, has 
always set an example in the music 
industry. They have done it once 
again with their new album Up, 
which is the group's first release 
without the services of ex-drummer 
Bill Berry. 

The sound or R.E.M. has drasti-
cally changed since the days of 
"Shiny Happy People." a fact that 
can clearly be seen on Up. R.E.M . 
have definite ly transcended the 
' I)Os genre limitations. 

The dark and brooding "Air-
portman" opens the album with a 
short tale of an airline terrorist 
before exploding into "Lotus ," 
which is as catchy as any R.E.M. 
song has ever been. The record 
has the feel of a theme album 
without a central theme, as (he 

Thursday, November 19, 1998 

songs flow together beautifully 
whether they ' re fast. low, hard or 
son. 

Up is very 'imilar to Radio-
head 's OK Computer. It is ironi c 
that R.E.M. seems to imitate 
Radiohead, who named R.E.M. as 
their main inlluence. Imitation is a 
positive thing , however, as Up has 
the potential for 14 singles (the 
same number of tracks on the 
album). 

The group has already chosen 
its first single off Up, "Daysleep-
er," which is a Sergeant Pepper-
esque tune of harmony and nor-
mality; simple yet gorgeous. 
Michael Stipe 's voice rings as well 
as it ever has, and the lack of a 
constant percussionist doesn't 
seem to have held back any cre-
ative urges from Peter Buck and 
Mike Mills. 

Up is as complex as any critical-
ly acclaimed record in the past, and 
as catchy as any pop song heard on 
the radio today.

Thursday. Novt:mber II), 199!l 

BEHIND: 
BEP's songs share a 
diverse beat 
ContInued frGIII pace 9 
titude of cultural inlluences. 

While in high school. Will and 
ApI formed the dance crew Tribal 
Nation. That group evolved into 
Atban Klann (A Tribe Beyond 
Nation). They signed a record wn-
tract with Ruthless Records hack in 
1992. They recorded an alhum, hut 
the record never saw the light of 
day. 

Althuugh the album never came 
into fruition, Will and ApI did gain 
experience. With tIlt: addition of 
Taboo as a third Me. Black Eyed 
Peas was formed and began playing 
Los Angeles venues. B EP was also 
actively searching for a live band to 
perform with them during this time. 

"We wanted the emotion of a 
live group." Wi ll stated. "It·s like 
you're performing a different song 
each time because of the t:ncrgy 
and feeling that 's put into the 
music ." 

In 1995, the group won BMI 
and ASCAP showcases and discov-
ered the limd necessary ingredient 
to the band. Kim Hill . Will recruit-
ed Hill to work on a demo track . 

After one session. her sweet voice 
became an integral part of the BEP 
suund. Interest started building as 
the live shows produced a major 
underground following. Soon. their 
shows were crowded with fans , as 
well as representatives from fUany 
record labels. 

BEP signed with Interscope 
Records in July 1997 and immedi-
ately started recording. With Will 
and keyhoardist Brian Lapin at the 
control s. BEP recorded SO songs in 
Los Angeles. which were narrowed 
down to the 16 that appear on 
Behind the /-imll . 

The goal was si mple. "We 
Ihought about what we needed 1<1 
make an everlasting travel alhum. 
An album that will always be 
there," Will stated. ' 'To do that we 
incorporated the sounds we grew 
up on. lyrics we hclieve in and the 
energy of our live shows." 

Important among the infectious 
multi-cultural beats and rhythms 
are the positive lyrics performed by 
Will. Api and Taboo, including 
those in "Fallin' Up," and "Positiv-
ity." These songs express the fru s-
(ration the group members encoun-
tered when the hip-hop community 
gave them grief for trying to 
explore new ground and looking to 
the positive side as relming to the 

Tht: UCSD Guardian 

state of hip-hop and its senseless 
deaths. 

"We 're not the only individuals 
like this. and we're nm about 
preaching," Will stated. "We're just 
Joing what is real to us , what gives 
us energy and fec ls good. That's 
power to us. That's Behind the 
Fmnr." 

Tht: energy of the Peas has been 
relined over almost a half a year of 
touring. They joined the biggest 
names in hip-hop on the Smokin' 
Grooves tour this summer. and then 
proceeded to headline the Lyrici st 
Lounge tour alollg with Dc La 
Soul. suppol1ing Ihe underground 
scene. Sin~e then. they have contin-
ued to tour all over the United 
States. 

Excitement surrounding the 
upcoming concert has spread to 
UCSD. The DJ and Vinylphile 

~Iub . in partnership with Universal 
Musi c ,md Video Distribution. has 
arranged a lunch-time promotion in 
the Price Center on Nov. 24, from 
12-2 p.m. They will be bumpin' to 
the sounds of BEP and giving away 
sampler tapes. as well as posters 
and stickers. The event will also be 
the lirst opportunity to hcar the 
group's new album, 2Pac ',\' Creat-
est HilS. which will he released that 
same day.

swam excellently as well. taking

was a great w nlidencc hui Ider 
for the tcam. 

'1'his win gave u ~ a 101 of

On the men's side. unlilnu-

stroke and 2(X)-meler freestyle 
respel:lively. On Ihe divi ng 
hoard. Mall McDonalc.! was run-
ner-up in both the 1- and J-meter 
events. 

Overall. the Tritons arc swim-
ming faster at this point in the 
season than normal. It is even 
surpri si ng the wa<.:h. 

" A~ a new wadI <.:oming in. I 
knew UCSD had Ihe reputation 
of a good program," McGihon 
said. "But I' ve heen very 
impressed and happy with how 
thing~ arc going. This team is full 
or great individuals." 

The next meet for thc Tritons 
is a women's-nnl y meet at 
Uni ve rsit y at San Diego on 
Saturday against the Torcos and 
the Spartans or San Jose State, 
hot h wOr1hy Division I competi-
lion. 

With the big win last week, 
the Tri tons arc sure they can 
prove that Div ision IJJ is nUllO 
he laughed al. 

"I think we have a great 
chance this weekend," M<.:Gi hon 
said . .. It wi II hc very close with 
US D and San J o~e State." 

Women aim for the 
postseason 
Continued from ..... 20 
but al:hieva ble. 

"We have a lot or experience," 
Teasdale said. "And our rookies 
arc excited to play." 

Teasdu le also ~aid that one of 
the strong points of the ha~ ketba ll 
squad is that it i well -balanced 
whidl wi ll make it dilli<.: ult defen-
sively ror opponents. 

"Everyone will contribute equal -
ly," Teasdale said . "We don't have a 
star who we feed every time." 

With so many players capable 
of sw ring, the Tritons will use 
their indiv idual speed and create 
rasthreaks to distribute the scoring 
- a strategy that worked well last 
season. 

UCSD beat its regional oppo-
nents, like Chapman and Ca l 
Luthl! ran, last year and expe.:ts 10 
have equa lly successful outings 
against them this year, The Tritons, 
however, do realize that each game 
will be dillerem and anything can 
huppen. 

"If you don' t come out ready to 
play lots of things can happen," 
Teasdale said. 

Like losing. But the Trilons 
don ' t cxpec t thi s to happen. Thi s 
Friday, the Tritons will open up 
their campaIgn agai nst the 
Unive rsity of SI. Thomas (Minn.) 
at 6 p.m. SI. Thomas usually 
makes it 10 the postseason so thi s 
ga me may be a him of whal the 
NCAA Championships wi ll hold . 

"We hope people wi 11 get into 
it," Teasdale sa id. "We're a fun 
team 10 watch.

HOOPS: 
Men foresee another 
promlsmg year 
Continued frOlll PIC- 20 
forward position and three-point 
range. 

Field's transfe r to Division I 
University of San Diego, though, 
will probably hun the Tritons the 
mos\. Fie ld stood at 6' 9" und was 
a do minant for<.:c at l:enler last year 
for UCSD, rout inely racking up 30 
points or more, The Tritons will be 
hard-pressed to replace his inside 
rebounding presence and scoring 
ability. 

"You don' t replace a guy like 
Field," Lanthier said. "He was on 
the level that I think he belonged 
somewhere like USD. Since it hap-
pened in the off-season, I think we 
adjusted well. You lose people all 
the time in college basketball with 
graduation and tnmsfers ." 

Positi ve thinking has always 
been a hallmark of Triton basket-
ball and this year is no different. 
Noth ing can stop UCSD from 
be li evi ng it wi ll have a greut yeur 
and it can ' t wait to stan . 

The season opener will come 
against La Verne University here in 
RIMAC Arena at 7 p.m. 

"1 thi nk we matdl up well with 
any Division III team," Lanthier 
said, "but La Verne plays hard and 
it will be a good game." 

Last season, the Tritons beat the 
Panthers, 82-8 1 with a desperation 
shot at the buzzer. 

This year's game looks to be 
even more exciting. Come out and 
cheer on UCS D. Tip off is at !l

~~I IT'S RETRO BOWL FRIDAY, ISN'T IT? Lei's have some fun thiS week Let's imagine whal UCSD was tlke 20 
years ago dunng Ihe third week In November. . 10 tntramural Land. OK now, 
everybody gently close your eyes,tet yourself go and dream a little. Yah .. thaI's 

nghl.. .Just dnfl ott for a hUle bit ... c'mon now ... you can see ctea rty now, can't you? 
It's the Fnday before ThanksgiVing al our cozy liltle campus near the PacifiC. The lall colors have slarted 

10 set 10 and even though the sun is out as brignlly as ever. the air IS a bil more bnsk than normal. 
There seems 10 be a 101 of aCllvlty emanallng from the Muir F,etd area. Oh ya, I see II now ... there's some 

kind oltoolball feslivat gOing on ... Lei'S swoop in for a closer look. 
Wow, took al lhls scene. I\'s the tM Football ptay·olfs ... 1978. 
LeI's see ... on Ihls field we've got a bunch at games coming up .. and over on that field there is a whote 

bunch more It tooks tlke they've gal names for the championship games ... wow .. thal's unique Hey, listen to 
this ..... 

THE ANIMAL BOWL (EmIIlen'" of the Men's AlA F". CIa •• lonship) 
ROB'S RAIDERS (7-0) are ptaying the HUSKERS (7·0) at 7 o'clock 
Here's Ihe buzz: The Raiders are big 11 pomt favontes. They've gal over·seasoned atumni qua rterback 

Derek Bennett Ihrowlng and running the ball all over Ihe yard. 
He throws tillle chlnkers to cenler Kevin Napolitano until the detense adjusts and Ihen he goes deep to Kirk 

Mllter. A time-tested lormula to be sure. The Huskers who are playing much belter than their Nebraska 
counterpa rts will have 10 bend but not break on defense. II they can somehow manage to score twice, the 
Huskers can Win Ihls one. Bul they'll need to have a coupte of good extra poinl ptays. 

THE BANANA BOWL (Men's AA Champ.onship) 
TOOL TtMERS (8-0) VS. LES GIRLS (8-0) 
Here s Ihe buzz: The Tool TImers are 5 and 1/2 POint favonles. Only because these guys are old. But Ihe 

stark reatlty of Ihe sltualion is atso Ih,s .... these guys are really good. Most at them spend therr working trme 
cteanlng up RIMAC and gardening allhe baseball fietd. Somehow thai quahfies Ihem 10 be good In loolball ... but 
don't ask us how. 

OB Josh La wrence IS Ihe bomb, except he's never Ihrown one. All he does all game tong IS Ihrow a bunch 
ot 5'yard square ouls and sWing passes to his receivers. And the next thing you know they've got 30 pOints on 
Ihe board. 

The Les GIrl squad has been holding secrel practices at thell Midway lacility on Rosecrans. Bnan Ander-
son. Joe Ftorin, Dae Hee Kim, and Jeff Bassett can ptay a litlle ... uuuh tootball, that is. And we' lltind out how 
well Fnday nighl at 7 o'clock. Can Bassett get deep enough times to keep up with the high scoring Toot Timers. 
We'll see! 

THE CADAVER BOWL (Men's Elite A Championship) 
AN JU DON'T KNOW (6-0) vs. KCM (7-0) 
Here's the buzz: An Ju Don'l Know are big 13 POlnl fa vorites. As everyone IS sayIng: "the M,SSIon IS over" 

for the tads Irom KCM. Danny Chun . KCM's do·everylhlng talenl Will be churning for sure, bUI you can't stop 
the depth , skill, and exhausllve ptaybook oltast year's defending champs Don't Know hnes it up and runs to 
the corner as quick as any 1M team ever. 

THE COFFEE BOWL (Men's A Championship) 
POLK HtGH (3-3) vs. 0-14 (6-1) 
IHere's the bulz: Polk High tail back AI Bundy Is primed in his pumps for a big 4-touchdown performance 

this Friday at 6pm. Or IS he? 0 ·14 has suddenty found its defense and may conlinue to foot even Ihemselves. 

THE SOUL BOWL (Coed AA Championship) 
OLD FOGEY'S (5-0) vs. JANINE LOVES TRAVIS (6-0) 
Here's the buzz: Another classic match up of age vs. beauty. Fogey's have plenly of great alh teles, but 

lei's face il ... Ihey are nol gelling any younger. Trieu, Ung. Ross, and Bennett are a tot 10 handte in the open 
field, but welhlnks iI's time for change al Ihe top of Ihe ladderboard. JLT WIll be motivated for sure after their 
lough tuck losses in Ihe Men's Football ptayoffs and the NCAA Soccer Championships. II there is an upset oul 
there, Ih ls one mighl be il. 
THE CLIMAX BOWL ICoed A Championship) 

M.O.B. (5-1) vs. THE ROCK (4-2) 
Here's Ihe buzz: Is thiS match·up anything more Ihan a Billy Womack vs. Danny Chun tille light LeI's 

hope so. Whichever team finds ItS "01 her good" ptayers lirsl , will surety come out on lap. But good luck on 
thaI one

Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier has the C 0 
men '~ haskethall team gearing up 
ror another great seasun. Last 
year, the Tritons were 18-7 and 
just barely missed making the 
playoffs despite earni ng 
Honorable Mention in the 
Division III West Regionals. 

UCSD played an up-tempo 
exci ting style of game and almost 
led the nation in points per game, 
but the defense was sometimes 
lacking. This year, the defense is 
improved and the squad is deter-
mined to make a run to the top of 
Division III. 

If the team does, it will have 
its senior leadership to thank. In 
Lanthier's ti ve years at UCSD. he 
has never had more than one 
sen ior on the team in any given 
year. Yet thi s season he has six -
Adam Libby, Nick Marou5tsoS. 
Tyler Garralt, Jocl Foote, Mike 
Wall and Ahmad Russ . This 
depth in older players means the 
tealll will play well together and 
th at it will know what is required 
to win. 

All the experi ence will have to 
make up ror the loss of two 
important players rrom last 'ea-
son - Mark Sebek and Tyler 
Field. 

Sebek, the lone senior from 
last year, will be sorely missed 
hecause of hi s toughness at the
