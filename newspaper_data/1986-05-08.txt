Attorney General may 
expel Libyan students 

U.S. Atlomey General Edwin 
Meese III indicated in late Apnl 
that 2,000 Libyan students in the 
Unitcd States are among those 
under scrutiny for possible 
expulsion to ease the threat of 
terrorism. 
, "We've aleady taken steps in 

the past to remove people ... 
who might be involved in 
terrorism. We're reviewing that to 
be sure we are , in fact, taking all 
the precautions that are 
necessary and pOSSible ," Meese 
said at a news conference when 
questioned about whether libyan 
students would be expelled. 

Meese said earlier that he 
planned to meet with 
immigration officials to consider 
what action might be taken to 
force Libyans out of the country. 

Black South Africans 
to study at UC 

A group of UC Santa Barbara 
administrators , headed by 
political science Professor 
Edmund Keller, who serves as 
UCSB's representative on the UC 
Commiuee on Educational 
Exchange Programs with South 
Africa, is working to allow black 
South African students , who are 
denied educational opportunites 
in their country, to study abroad 
at the eight UC campuses. 

The committee is working in 
conjuction with the South 
African Education Program. a 
U.S. based national scholarship 
program which seeks to develop 
sources of funding and to locate 
possible internship programs for 
black South African students. The 
UC exchange program will aim 
at "preparing black leaders for 
the new South Africa (which will 

BLOOM COUNTY 

arise when the apartheid system 
IS dismantled)." Keller said. 

'The educational system in 
South Africa is one of the most 
ineqUitable in existence. About 
$30 is spent annually for each 
black student, whereas in excess 
of $3000 is spent for a white 
student," Keller said. 

According to Keller, the 
exchange program is one way 
the UC system can "at least 
marginally affect the problems 
faced by non-whites In the 
Republic of South Africa.

Senate approves 
anti-apartheid bill 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU. Capitol Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO, UC wire - An 
anti-apartheid bill that would 
prohibit U.S. companies that do 
business in apartheid South 
Africa from making new 
retirement investments in that 
country was approved Monday 
by a Senate committee. 

The Senate Public Employment 
and Retirement Commitee voted 
3-2 to se nd Assemblywoman 
Maxine Waters' measure, AB 134, 
to th e appropriati,ons committee. 

The bill would ban future 
investmentS and the renewal of 
investment of UC Retirement 
System funds and other state 
retirement system funds. 
Currently UC's Retirement Sylion 
invest in those companies that 
do business in South Africa. 

According to Waters, 
California is lagging behind 17 
states. including New Jersey. 
Massachusetts and Michigan, 
.which have aready enacted 
divestment legislation of 
retirement funds. 

GOP Governor George 
Deukmejian vetoed a similar 
piece of legislation last year 
saying the Waters' bill went too 
far in restricting pension fund 
investments. he is expected to 
ve to this bU\, if it reaches his 
desk. 

Last year, Deukmejian issued 
an executive order asking state 

pension funds to' adopt the 
University of California's annual 
case-by-case review of corpora te 
conduct in racial South Africa. 

The UC Board of Regents uses 
the Sullivan Principles as its 
primary standards in reviewing 
stock holding. The principles call 
for the equal treatment of blacks 
in the workplace and to support 
the efforts to improve the overall 
quality of life for blacks in the 
country. 

But, Waters said that 
reviewi ng corporate conduct is 
not enough to end the racial 
discrimination in the COUntry. 
Although companies may try to 
improve the quality 01 life lor · 
South Africa's blacks, it is only 
for a limited few. she said. U.S. 
based corporations doing 
business in South Africa hire 
about 100,000 of the more than 
25 million blacks in the country. 

According to Waters' Chief of 
Staff, Sandra Simpson , reviewing 
companies' conduct would have 
a minimal effect on the 
population at large. 

"The blacks in South Africa are 
much more concerned about 
what their quality of life is 
outside of the workplace, 
irrespective of what kind of job 
they have ," Simpson said . 

The issue , Simpson said, is 
whether companies are putting 

money into the South African 
economy. 

"Any money that is placed in 
the South African economy at 
this time has a negative impact 
on the black people in that . 
country," Simpson said. "The 
South African economy is able tei 
run because of the input of 
foreign investment," she said. 

The va& majoriry of the 
Pretoria government's monetary 
'resources are placed into the 
police force , a police force that 
denies people their basic human 
rights based upon color. Simpson 
said. 

"The honorable thing ... to do 
in California is to not allow our 
pension funds to go into firms 
that are active in doing business 
in South Africa," Waters said. 

"No matter what kind of 
resistance we have from the 
Board of Regents," Waters said , 
"the issue is not going to go 
away: 

College campuses across the 
country have increased protest 
against apartheid and continue 
to support disinvestment 
poliCies. 

"The college campuses are re-
activated ," Waters said. "Students 
at a number of the University of 
California campuses, including 
UCLA and, of course , Berkeley,

Lost in La Jolla 

By PHIL WIllON 

I WONDER what the rich are doing today. Maybe I'll walk across the street and ask. 
Of all the places to stick a 
college, La Jolla ranks right 
there with Oxnard. Both have 
good weamer and are near the 
beach, but you wouldn't want [0 
live in either. Up nonh, it's a 
social desen, and down here , it's 
an overpriced social desen. 

Let'S face it, La Jolla is not a 
college town. Other places love 
students, they have pubs, coffee 
houses, quaint little shops and 
theatres and simple things, like 
gas stations. The only thing La 
Jo!la has for students is cops. 

When was the last rime you 
and your friends grabbed a beer 

• down in 01' LJ. If you go you'd 
bener wear tweed and bring lots 
of cash because they don't allow 

• T-shins and they don't take 
student American Express cards. 
Imagine what a scene you'd 

cause if you ordered a Schlitz, 
why they'd probably arrest you 
for loitering. Once, during my 
freshman year, I played a mean 
trick on the town. I drove my 
raggedy old VW Bug (that leaked 
oil) down one of their sidtstreets 
and lowered the property value. 

Over the past Cour ye~lrs I've 
been constantly amazed by the 
uninhibited uppityness of those 
people from below. Don't get me 
wrong, there are many 
conscientious and respectable La 
Jollans. It's their neighbors I can't 
stand. 

The newest addition to the 
Sruart Collection, a neon 
sculpture by Bruce Nuaman 
which flashes the seven virtues 
and seven sins, will nO( be 
placed atop the Mandell Weiss 
Center for the Performing Arts as 

ori~nany planned. They thou.l1;ht 
it would be an eyesore. It's too 
bad - a flashing red "Greed" 
and "Lusr" would have been a 

fitting beacon for the town. 
Currently, La Jollans are up in 

arms over the proposed new 
aquarium down at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. The 
last thing they want is something 
that might attl'3ct people. 
Heavens. Think of the noise. I'll 
bet all the merchants and 
resta urant owners are fit to be 
tied . Never mind the fact that 
Scripps is world renowned and 
has been here since the 
beginning of the century (even 
before most of the old money 
moved to town). 

It's people that make LaJollans 
upset. People drive cars, gawk at 
things and generally make the 
town look like a dump. That's 
why you'll never see condos. The 
wrong element might move in. 
Besides, condominium sounds 
too much like communism. Next 
thing you know aU income will 
be equaDy distributed, and (he 
poor Ferrari dealer will be put 
out of work. ~

A generation gap 

Editor: 
My generation is disillusioned ... 

The acceleration of life for us has 
been so great that into the last few 
years haY( been cro'Mied the 
experience and the ideas of a 
normal lifetime ... We ha\e been 
forced 10 become realists overnight. 
instead of idealists, as was our 
birthright. 

F. ScOtt Fitzgerald 

Fitzgerald's generation in the 
1920's suffered from the actions 
of generations past, namely 
World War One. Likewise , his 
quote can equaUy apply to the 
current student generation. This 
generation , which started in the 
late '70s, also suffers from the 
lessOns learned from the past 
generation 'S episodes during the 
late '60s and 70s. This 
generation is foUowing a trend 
towards individualism. Its people 
have become realists. And there 

does not seem to be an outside 
inOuence, national or 
international. that is going to get 
in their way. 

Probably the r:nost obvious 
characteristic of this generation 
is career-orientation anct self-
motivation. In today's coUege life, 
the pressure of grades are gready 
increased. Not so much because 
of the learning institution itself, 
but because of competition 
between students. In order to

Traveling like 
an American 

As the summer months come upon us, we students 
consider how we might best spend our hours ofleisure . 
We all hope that once we are free from our demanding 
academic hours we will begin to reap the financial or 
experiential benefits of our vacation. 

For some of us, the agonies of the nine to five, punch 
the clock, workday await.ln the midst of our education, 
we stock up on recommendations, resume fillers , and 
cold, hard, cash in preparation for the winny weeks 
we'll spend searching for our places in the world . Or 
instead of making practical preparations, we claim our 
last days as free men and women and head for the 
Continent, or the Bahamas, or Asia. 

We finally get some time to think about the real 
world, and we get selfish . We expect that the world is 
ours to buy, and we still avoid getting close to real 
political issues. 

It's funny how shocked we become when we can no 
longer choose our most fantastic vacation plans. We're 
complaining because suddenly we're not given free 
reign to travel as we will. When we make our excursions 
abroad , we expect that our dollars are valuable enough 
to afford us any pleasure. We, at first, think that other 
countries are a larger version of Disneyland - if we 
spend enough money we should be abfe to buy or see 
anything. 

We hear about terrorist attacks. We think we learn 
about war. But our greatest concern is that we will not be 
able to frequent our favorite patch of sand on the 

. Mediterranean. Our travel agents get nervous because 
they might not sell enough first-class fares. And our 
politicians go on tirades because their upper-class 
constituents can't take the family jaunt to Kenya this 
year. We think that we are concerned about the state of 
world affairs. We think that we want to cooperate with 
other nations. But, when it comes right down to it, we 
really just want to be able to do exacdy as we please. 

What kind of relationship do we have with other 
nations of the world? We mUSt learn the value of the 
hospitality we are offered by other counties. We cannot 
act like we are long absent owners returning for a visit to 
our unoccupied homes. Equally, as we make our daily 
political dealings with other nations, we must realize 
that they are independent states, both culturally and 
politically. 

The protestant work ethic is k.illing our community. 
Sitting around in our offices or running around on our 
tours, we think that we are safe. As long as we do our jobs 
we think that the world will be well. We think that if we 
obey our moral and legal codes our political affairs can 
only get better. We must learn to be more cr,<ical of our 
habits and institutions. 

Because we are able to finance our many projects, it is 
easy for us to forget the effects of our actions on the 
world. We lounge around in our home towns feelins-
comfortable, beli~ving that the world is. ours to dictate 
We ignore those problems that do not d~recdy affect us. 
Our concern is only as large as that which we hear on 
our nighdy news. Otizens of other nati?~s. ar:e much 
more interested in politics. They take the initiative to be 
citizens of the world . We must also. 

We must realize that we are responsible for commun-
teating with one another as individuals and as repre-
sentatives of our cUltures. We must make the effort to . 
act for the sake of the bettennent of the world rather 
than merely for our own gain. 

This summer we must aU become members of the 
international community. We must make responsible 
and . active choices to ch~nge the way that we think 
about our involvement Wlth other cultures. We must 
have vision enough to respect their integrity, and we 
must be conscientious enough to see how our actions 
affect their futures. This summer, we should be grateful 
for the hospitality we receive.

OPINIONS 

Cornering an ideological inequity 
By KATHY BECKETI, Conlibuting Opmions Editor 

The predominance of ideology 
as a cohesive force is perhaps 
the most frightening and 
dangerous development of 
modem times. In theory, 
ideologies prqvide the basis for a 
framework of interpretation, but 
all too often, they degrade and 
devalue human life. The intrinsic 
value of the individual is negated 
with the wave of a flag, with the 
policies that treat people as a 
means to an end, and with the 
conclusion that death can be 
justified in the name of a 
specific struc ture of vision of 
society. 

As interpretive frameworks, 
ideologies are often based on 
half-truths. Nevertheless, these 
half-truths threaten to become 
the focus of anention; the reality 
of social, economic and political 
relationships are being rendered 
obsolete. Ideologies that are 
based on half-truths necessitate 
elite decision-making; those facts 
that are determined to be 
contradictory must be destroyed 
or at least forgonen. The current 
trend towards increased 
government control of 
information corresponds to the 
rise of anti-communism and 
currently, anti-Kadafiism. 

Ideologies contain both a 
vision of the perfect society and 
the blue print for the 
achievement of that vision; it is 
in the attempt to achieve this 
vision that the individual may 
become subordinate to a "higher" 
goa\. Inherent in this process is a 

moral dilemma: the destruction 
of many lives, biological or 
spiriTUal, cannot be justified by 
the effort to achieve such a 
vison. If life is not sacred, who is 
to say that the eradication of 
Libya itself is not justified? 
Where does one draw the line? 

It appears that the Reagan 
Adminsitration does not. The 
human cost of President Reagan 's 
anti-communist ideology has 
been enormous. In El Salvador 
alone, over 60,000 innocent 
civilians have been murdered by 
government forces that are 
supported by the administration 
in the name of the United 
States's security. President 
Reagan dares to voice concern 
for the "quality of life of 
Nicaraguans" while U.S.-backed 
contras inform indigenous 
peoples that the Sandinistas' 
va~cinations are poison, thereby 
causing the deaths (is it 
repetative to say unnecessary 
deaths?) of thousands more . 

It is not for Americans tha t the 
phrase "U.S. Security concerns" 
has such deadly connotations. 
Thirty-eight Libyan lives were 
taken in the name of the security 
"of all free peoples." Worse, it 
appears that these lives were 
taken in vain; since those 
murders, terrorism has not 
ceased, nor has there been any 
indication that it will abate in 
the near fUTUre . Indeed, three 
additional lives were taken in 
direct response to U.S. attacks 
on Libya. Now what? 

It is a great chaUenge for a 
government that worsens the 
conditions of the least well-off 
and increases inequity to 
maintain the suppon of the 
populace. Bureaucratic-
authoritarian governments. like 
that of Chile . find refuge from 
this debacle through the 
implementatiori of a "National 
Security Doctrine." This doctrine 
usuaDy takes the form of anti-
communism, and places the 
interests of the state above those 
of the individual. The legitimacy 
of the government depends upon 
its ability to "protect" its 
population; criticism of its 
domestic and economic policies 
is deflected through the elevation 
of this function. 

One thing is certain: the 
United States cannot resolve the 
dilemma posed by the existence 
of a $2 trillion debt without 
forcing Its cost on the domestic 
population. The demands of . 
workers are being met with 
increased hostility, as was 
demonstrated in New England 
last week. Innumberable 

~vemment programs that 
provide a variety of services to 
students, the elderly, veterans 
and the handicapped are being 
hacked while military spending 
remains at an all-time high . To 
those who feel' the cost of these 
cuts and who suffer from the 
absence of an invisible hand, Mr. 
Reagan will have to explain and 
justify their quandry. It seems 
that he has decided what the 

basis for this rationalization will 
be. 

History teaches many lessons. 
With respect to U.S. relations 
with Third World nations , 
concilatory U.S. positions have 
resulted in moderate social 
change; U.S. opposition to such 
change has, in general, produced 
more virulent rejections of the 
Western world . Secondly, 
increases in the number and 
improvements, in the capabilities 

of armaments has resulted in a 
less secure and stable world. 
Both of these lessons are 
apparently rejected by Mr. 
Reagan perhaps due to his 
rejection of history itself. It 
remains unclear that Mr. 
Reaj!;an 's vision is one of 
international cooperation and 
security. One wonders what his 
vision really is , and what the f 
human COSt of his attempt to 
acheive it through militarism will 
be . mJ

surpass other students, today's 
students must strive to be the 
best of the best. 

Most everybody wants to 
realize the American dream. 
People want to make money and 
retire early. However, not 
everyone is going to make it. 
Simply talking to my roommates, 
I discover that some of their 
goals are very materialistic and 
self-centered. They want to take 
over where their parents left off. 
Owning cars and homes is very 
important. It seems that only 
wealth would enhance their 
happiness. 

I admit that I am not 
unaffected by this trend. Many of 
their goals are the same as mine. 

Yet, to what can we attriblae this 
need to accumulate money? It is 
certainly a different sentiment 
than thal of slightly over a 
decade ago. The cause can 
partially be attributed to recent 
economic recession. According 
to newspaper columnist R.J. 
Samuelson, ·lnDation, oil price 
increases and periodic 
recessions made the. .. ambitions 
of getting a job and making 
money more imperative: 

The students of the late 70s 
who comprised the beginning of 
this generation, vividly remember 
the slight depression between 
the Caner and Reagan 
adminisnarions. These people .

each other to sUlVive the 
recession. In doing so. future 
students were caught up in the 
trend and were therefore also 
forced to compete. This chain 
reaction ro economic problems 
has forced everyone to try to 
obtain maximum wealth. The fact 
that these goals will probably not 
be realized by most, forces 
poeple to strengthen their 
personal development while 
ignoring the affairs outside the 
universitY. 

Another deeper cause of the 
trend towam individualism was. 
at one point. disenchantment 
with the government. Our faith 
in govemment since Watergate 
and Vietnam has collapsed. The 
earlier members of this 
generation might clearly 
remember Viemam or the 
resignations of a preSident and a 
vice-president. The student 
learned Ihal they had ro survive 
for and by themselves. because 
their government would not help 
them. 

However. because the current 
part of the generation may not 
remember those incidents as 
clearly incidents, people are 
taking a different view of the 
government. We have all read 
and experienced the effects of 
Ronald Reagan as preSident. We 
know how reassuring he appears . 
He lets us feel there is nothing to 
wony about on the international 
level. Because of this. there is 
simply more time to think of 
ourselves. Now. the reason for 
our individualism has changed 
from a lack of trust in our 
w>vernment to a confidence that 
allows us only to wony about 
ourselves. Even though it has 
barely been a decade since 
Vietnam. it might have been a 
centul)' since students 
congregated in protest. This 
generation's identity stems from 
the need to personaUy and 
individually advance. 

I believe that the last cause of 
this trend is a result of the 
realization that the only thing 
we have coru:rol over is ourselves 
As individuals, we usuaUy can't 
change anything of great 
magnitude. This generation has 
come to the conclusion that we 
can't aU be saviours for others. 
Instead we created a cruS3de for 
our own self-advancement - a 
crusade to enhance the only 
thing we can definitely affect. 

But where is this trend of 
individualism going? With 
Reagan assuring evel)'one that 
everything is alright abroad, we 
might continue to believe in our 
government. Perhaps, our 
generation or the next generation 
will eventually see something 
different in our w>vemment. 
However, we must also consider 
when. if ever, we will feel as 
though we can support oruselves 
and stan to take care of others. 
When we have reached our w>als 
do we set higher ones or help 
others with their goals? When 
this new decision is made. a 
new trend will be fonned .

According to opponents of the

Administration. the current 
policy of reviewing companies 
using the Sullivan Principles has 
been working. 

SIeve Ardilti . UC Administration 
lobbyist. said actions are being 
taken against companies who do 
nO! comply with the Sullivan 
Principles. In March. the Regents 
voted to divest $12.3 million in 

stock from Cleveland-based 
Eaton Corp. Because it did not 
try 10 improve its treatment of 
blacks in the work place . he 
said . 

The universiry has also made a 
decision "not 10 purchase any 
more srock in Naico," Arditti 
said,"unless it changes its 

, business relationship with Soulh 
Africa's blacks. 

Waters said that the Regents' 
policy of a case-by-case revi ew 
"is a band-aid on an anempt to 
make it appear that UC is doing 
something on the issue. when in 
fact it really is not and its 
actions are clearly against the 
wishes of the students." 

"I was so disappointed that

Tourism and terrorism 

How safe is it to travel in Europe? 
By TRISH BROWN 

COLLEGE STUDENTS plus summer equals travel abroad. Or at least it used 
to. Will that equation still hold 
true this summer, or will fear of 
terrorist reprisals after the United 
States bombing of Libya make us 
afraid to leave home? 

It's made Rambo, that self-
styled defender of "the American 
Way," change his plans to go to 
Europe this summer. This year's 
Cannes Film Festival will have to 
get along without Sylvester 
StaDone, as well as quite a few 
other Hollywood celebrities, an of 
whom have cancelled plans to 
attend the annual movie awards 
event because of the possibility 
of terrorist incidents. 

But UCSD students are 
apparently tougher and more 
determined than he is; they 
don't intend to let fear StOP 
them. Even though UCSD 
programs abroad are urging 
prudence for students who 
participate, mast are proceeding 
with business as usual 

European programs at other 
college campuses in the San 

Diego area have not been 
affected to some extent by the 
current political situation. San 
Diego State University has a 
summer travel/study program 
that goes to a number of westem 
European countries, including 
Spain, Italy and France. Sue 
Powers of that office says 
enrollment for this summer is 
low "probably because of the 
terrorism." She says enough 
people enrolled that the trip 
could go, but 'not nearly the 
number we have had in the 
past.ft But even with adequate 
enrollment, the trip will probably 
be cancelled. 

Powers says the feeling is that 
it's too much of a liability for 
them to risk. Other SDSU 
programs abroad, however, will 
continue. Neither their semester 
in London program and the 
year-long programs abroad have 
been cancelled. "We had our 
orientation for students going 
over this past Saturday,ft said a 
spokesperson for the Division of 
Undergraduate Studies, "so 
they're an going. I don't see why 

The sublime spoils 
of yuppiedom 
By JON PREIMESBERGER 

Look at you!" she said. JUSt look at you!" she repeated. Her face 
molded in disgust. ·You're so ... you're so yuppie!" 

The terror in her voice was like the pronouncement of some fatal 
disease. 

"You are not only reading the LA Times but its business section as 
well!" 

I smiled inwardly as I realized the cause of hertirade. I had JUSt 
settled down to my morning paper, a habit my friend had not seen 
before. 

"What's wrong with it?" 
"Just look at you. You're not even out of school, and you're already 

reading the paper like some businessman." 
"There's important information in this section, which banks are 

turning profits, what billion-dollar mergers are rumored, where 
local investment opponunities are ... " 

"Since when have you been interested in any of that?" 
"Lately,"1 could only answer. But I wanted to add how I felt drawn 

into the world, how books were no longer satisfying. Now I wanted 
to experience something more concrete - the skyscrapers 
downtown, or the low-lying buildings that crouch in the hills 
around school. 

She scoffed finally, "At least it's not the Wall Street Journal ." 
I laughed because I knew a recent copy of that paper was in my 

desk. 
"And just look at your clothes!" 
I glanced down thinking that maybe my shin was not tucked in 

. or my pants were wrinkled. 
"Do you have an interview today?" she said calmly. 
"No," I said, sensing she was restraining herself. 
"Do you have a meeting today?" 
hNo." 
''Then why the hell are you dressed like you are going to work?" 
I like these clothes, you can't go through life wearing Levi 's 

everyday." 
I could see that she did not understand about quality things. Nice 

c1mhes not only wear longer. but they make me feel Inexpressibly 
content. Wearing the latest style is being a pan 01 aU that IS lresh 
3}ld current It's like listening ro a new song. My friend was one of 
those who wore LeVI'S everywhere - ro class, [0 dinner, to concens 
She'd probably wear them to bed if she gOt the chance. Well, 
almost. 

"J don't know you. What happened to the guy I met in 
Philosophy of An?" 

"I've just adapted [0 my times. I suppose you want ro become a 
park ranger or something equaUy unrealistic ." I could see that she 
was hun by the remark. I think she had told me sometime before 
that she wouldn't mind being a ranger. I thought that I'd better

not. I mean, we could step 
outside our doors here and get 
killed as weD as if we were 
there." 

San Diego Mesa College, 
which had summer language 
programs scheduled in four 
countries this year, has cancelled 
the entire program. Betty Fonier, 
Dean of off-campus programs 
there, says they felt the risk was 
too great Many students are 
disappointed, but they 
understand why the 
administration had to do it, 
Fortier says. She hopes to 
reinstate the programs to 
England,'France, Spain and Italy 
next summer. 

At UCSD, none of the overseas 
programs have been cancelled. 
Molly Ann McCarren, Education 
Abroad Program advisor, says, 
"My students are not afraid to go 
(to Europe). They're more afraid 
they won't get to go; that the 
programs might be cancelled." 
The EAP office places students in 
year-abroad programs in 
countries as diverse as France, 
Egypt and Norway. 

Catherine Gamon, an 
Opponunities Abroad advisor, 
places students in programs 
outside the UC system. "I'm 
plugging individual students into 
different locations for different 
lengths of time," she says. SOme 
of ihese involve academic 
programs, some are volunteer 
work programs, others are 
internships, which are all over 
the world. Gamon says her 
understanding is that, although 
tourism in general in Europe "is 
way down," student tourism 
hasn't been affeted by the threat 
of terrorism. "Maybe middle-
aged, middle-class people are 
staying away from Europe in 
droves, but students are still 
charging ahead," she adds. 
Gamon says not many students 
have come to her saying they 
want to change their plans. In 
fact. every day more students tell 
her they're going abroad this 
summer or next year. 

Summer session has language 
programs scheduled in Madrid 
and Paris this year. The Spain 
program is filled with a waiting 
list and the one to France has 
enough people to go. "In the past 
week we've had 10 people sign 
up ." says Dr. Sanford Schane, 
professor of bnguistics, who 
heads Ihe pr02Tllms. 

Jil K. Warn, management 
services officer of summer 
session, says they'll wait and see 
what happens befor deciding 
whether the trips will go. "We're 
using May )0 as our cut-off date 
10 make that decision," she says. 
"We can wait and see how 
things look by next month ." 

Schane says he thinks it's wise 
of the summer session office to 
take this wait-and-see attitude. 
"It would be different," he says, 
"if the United States' intervention 
in Libya and the retaliations that 
are going on now had happened 
a week before we were to leave. 
Now we have twO months, and 
hopefully we'll have a better 
perspectiv~ on things a month 
from now. 

The UCSD staff say they 
haven't heard much expression 
of concern from students. Both 
McCarren and Warn say they've 
received a few calls from 

concerned parents of students 
enrolled in programs abroad. 
Warn says she's told the parents 
that "we will not send (the 
students) over to Europe if 
there's a life-threatening crisis 
over there." And McCarren, 
whose students are awav from 
home for a year, says the parents 
she's talked with seem to want to 
be reassured that if the 
University thinks the students 
are in real danger, we will bring 
them home. "I assure them. yes, 
we will," she says. 

Adam Walsh , a UCSD drama 
major, will spend nexl year 
studying in France. He says he's 
far more worried about being 
randomly mugged on the streets 
of Paris than about being blown 
up by terrorists. "I won't hang 
out in any nightclubs where only 
Americans hang out," he says. 
"Also (when I travel abroad) I 
don't take great pains to point 
myself out as an American." 

Chris Bonon, double majoring 
in German literature and 
computer science, is preparing 
for his year in Germany by 
"reading as much as I can" about 
American and world politics. He 
points out that Europeans are 
much more politically aware than 
we in the United States, and he 
feels the current political 
situation makes it even more 
necessary for Americans to try 10 
be as knowledgeable as possible. 

Neither Walsh nor Borton has 
considered cancelling his year 
abroad. Bonon says one or two 
of his friends have told him they 
wouldn't go 10 Europe now, but 
he isn 't deterred. Walsh likens 
the recent rash of Amencan 
travelers' cancellation of 
European trips to "the Tylenol 
scare and MacDonald's (in San

Being an only child 
By NINA BHOJWANI, 

FOR AGES I have read anicles and heard people speculate on the perils of 
being an only child. 

They are overachievers, self-
centered and selfish . Or so I am 
told . When I read or hear these 
things I become angry and hun. 
I can't believe that people 
actually have the nerve to make 
such generalizations. I have 
patiently tolerated these 
misconceptions and now it is my 
tum to put my twO cems in. 

1 can 't help but get the feeling 
that it is unfashionable to be an 

only child. People who question 
why I ha~ no brothers and 
sisters automatically assume one 
of twO things, either that I was a 
mistake or thaI I came from a 
family which could only afford 
one child. 

At these times, I can't help but 
laugh because the truth of the 
matter is that neither one of 
these explanations is true. No, I 
wasn't a mistake - at least I'm 
pretty sure I wasn't - and my 
parents are far from the brink of 
poverty. What I cannot 
understand is why there has to

Ysidro where 21 people were 
killed in 1984)." He says only a 
relatively small number of people 
died in those instances, but 
"those are things we usuaRy take 
for granted. I think it's more the 
j ncongruity than anything else .... 
Roben E. Hunter pointed OUt in 
a recent opinions piece in the 
Los Angeles Times, only 2) 
Americans were killed by 
terrorists overseas last year, while 
alm(}5t 10,000 were shot to death 
back home the year before. 

Professor Schane agrees that 
statistically an American tourist's 
chances of getting shot by a 
terrorist are small. He feels it's 
important to remember that 
being in the wrong place at the 
wrong time can happen even 
when American travelers aren't 
the intended target. As for 
precautions, he says hell 
probably teD the students this 
summer the same things he 
usuaDy tens them - rhings to do 
in order to have a better time 
and to best fit into their host 
country. 

'I've always told students not 
to wear inappropriate clothes: 
you don't run around in shons 
in Madrid and you don't wear 
tank tops to the Louvre. This is 
basic protocol, but it also makes 
you look less like a conspicious 
American." The rest of his advice 
has to do with language. "You 
want to make progress in the 
language," he says, "so it's to 
your advantage to speak French 
the whole time there, not

be a reason . 1 don't think there 
is any reasonable explanation for 
my status as an only child. 

After 19 years of being an only 
child, I still don't know how to 
react when people say, "I would 
hate being an only child. I bet 
you do, too." I think this is a 
really dumb thing to say to 
someone. In my opinion, it's like 
sa ying, "I hate lima beans, I bet 
you do too." And just to set the 
record straight, I really don't hate 
it. I've gotten used to it and I'm 
even happy about it. 

Contrary to popular belief, not 
having any Siblings does have its 
advantages. Other than the fact 
that I've received more than my 
share of lessons, presents and 
love , the biggest advantage is 
that I have been given the 
opportunity, like many other 
only children, to get to know 
and·be friends with my parents. 
I ha~ no doubt that to many 
people, this isn't a very big 
privilege and it's really no big 
deal. 

But I think it is. I can truly say 
that I know the people whose 
lives I have altered so drastically 
jUst by my very presence. In 
recognizing them as people 
instead of just Mom and Dad, I 
have come to love them not 
through obligation, but rather by 
choice. 

I would be lying if I didn't 
admit that there are times when 
I wish I did have a brother or 
sister. It'd be wonderful to have a 
buUt in friend - someone to 
give advice to and take advice 
from. And sometimes I wish I 
could experience the fun of 
fighting with a sibling. And it's 
probably a great feeling to get 
letters from a brother or sisler 
while you are at college. 

Certainly both situations have 
their advantages and 
disadvantages. But why can't 
people acknowledge this plain 
fact? Why can't they realize that 
it's not bad - only different to

be an only child? I think it's 
because the majority of people 
are happy with their lives and 
couldn't imagine life any other 
way. 

The same goes for me, too. I 
wish others would realize that one 
siluation isn'l necessarily better . 
than the other. I have tried many 
times to discuss this situation 
with my boyfriend , who is from 
a rather large family, but we 
always seem to end up going in 
circles. 

"No , Nina, I really wouldn't 
like to be an only child because I 
reaDy don't think you learn how 
to stand up for yourself and you 
really don't learn tolerance and 
patience - which, by the way, 
is essential to everyday life ," he 
declares. 

"Are you saying that I am 
meek and that I have a hot 
temper?" I ask, a little bit 
offended . 

·Well, I'd harldy say you're 
meek, and well , you do kind of 
have a little of a hot temper -

suggest. 

"How rude you are! At least 
I'm not the world's number one 
door mat! I can't even believe 

"See! What did I tell you. 
You're not even used to having 
people disagree with you. But 
don't worry. I know it's nOI your 
fault that you're an only child. I 
even forgive you," he offers, like 
he's just given me the gift of life .. 

So, I've come to the conclusion 
that arguing about the subject is 
not going to make matters any 
better. I can only hope that 
people will realize that an only 
child shouldn't be treated as if 
he or she has some incurable, 
disease . We're not selfISh and 
self-centered, in fact, many of us 
are generous and caring towards 
others. Maybe someday - ' 
people will realize that the state 
of being an only child isn't 
deserving of aU the analyzing 
and striCt scrutiny it gets. The 
only thing it really merits is 
acceptance. mJ

She sneared, "I didn't hear you say that" She looked around the 
room like she was examining things for the first time. Nervously, 
she picked up a stack of magazines from the table, running off their 
names as she plopped them back down, "GQ, Sports mustrattd's

According to Yates, Bowen has 
intimated that La Verne was 
unlikely to be chosen. Yates 
believes, however. that the real 
battle will be fought over who is 
to play the Tri tons. "I believe it's 
cut and dried - we should be

said . There are many factors in 
the Tritons' favo r - best overall 
record, best offensive and

Yates warned, "especially after 
last year." The Tritons did not 
make the rlayoffs last year 
because 0 a sub-.500 record, 
despite the fact the ir schedule 
was the toughest of any team in 
Division 1II. 

"As far as we're concerned ," 
,said Yates, "we're practici ng as 
though we're going to play 
Claremont this Friday." 

Yates received some good 
news earlier in the week when 
he learned that the statistical 
reports sent in over the course of 
the year - a factor in the 
National Committee final 
selections - were all there from 
UCSD. Stanislaus, according to 
Yates, had not been filing on a 

regular basis. "That's not going to 
help them at aU in the eyes of 
the committee," said Yates. 

Yates is so upse t over the 
possible rwo-week layoff that he 
is considering asking UCSD 
Athletic Director Judith Sweet -
vice president of NCAA Division 
1Il athletics - to order a 
mandatory cut-off date of May 5 
or so to elimmate confusion . 
"Last year, the cutoff date was 
May 3, and for some reason this 
year it changed suddenly," said 

Yat~~ "If we could get a 
consMent date, then everybody 
would know that any games 
played after that date wouldn't 
count." But for now the Tritons 
will just have to practice and 
hope that the holiday is a short 
one. ~

Injuries rock track team 
By GUS SANTOYO Contributing Sports Editor 

W ITH THE RUN of bad luck UCSD track coach Andy Skief has 
encountered this season. going 
down to the local clover patch 
and getting a few of the four-leaf 
variety mighr not be such a bad 
idea. If the rash of injuries to 
Skief troops doesn 't stop, getting 
a group rate at Scripps Hospital 
will be very easy. 

Injuries have hobbled the team 
in a big way. Three tOp athletes 
who qualified for nationals last 
year have been hit by the 

misfortune . Tom Kim, UCSD's 
top vaulter, was injured ar 
nationals and missed aU of this 
season . Andrea Veatch , another 
nationals qualifier, sustained a 
stress fracture during the last few 
meets of the season , and , on the 
advice of Skief. quit runnmg 
because trainers had a hard time 
diagnosing her injuries. Chris 
Thomas, one of the men's 
premier 1500-meter runners , has 
been hampered with a tendon 
problem. but still is competing, 
although not at full speed. 

Skief doesn 't see much chance 
of getting anyone from his squad 
to nationals. Gisele English , an 
800-meter speCialist, has an 
outside shot. but because of 
requirements imposed by the 
school, she must run a time of 
2:16 in her last tWO meets. Her 
best so far is 2: 18. "It's getting 
late in the season and it's going 
to be difficult for Gisele to make 
those times with only two meets 
to go." 

The team has still been able to 
win twO of the dual meets 
they've paticipated in and they 
placed second in the recent Cal 
Tech Invitational. Competition 
wraps up with the L.A 
Invitational relays on May 17 al 
Cal State Los Angeles. 1m

"THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE" 

Z Hill,," May 8, 1986 

The wave 
of the 

FUTURE 
A photographic exhibition entitled "Seewald's Local Seascapes, 

A.O.R.? (After Oil RigsO" by Michael Seewald will premiere at the Belly-
Up Tavern, H3 S. Cedros, in Solana Beach. The exhibit opens May 1 and 
will run through June 30. An artist reception will be held Saturday, May 
10, from" to 8 pm and is open to the public. 

The exhibit is in protest of plans to start oil production off San Diego 
shorelines. Seewald photographed oil rigs in Huntington Beach, Newport 
Beach and Santa .Barbara and combines them with titles of local beaches, 
portra ying a not-so-pretty futuristic view of San Diego. "Both the public 
and local politicians are against this madness," Seewald Says, "Almost 
every nation now produces oil. Companies in the United States are 
closing do~ existing oil producing rigs, and yet they ~nt to openjUp new 
ones and rum our coast." He says he hopes the imag~ll motivate 
people to write their U.S. senators and congressmen. 

One of Seewald's prints, titled "Volleyball Courts, Moonlight Beach, 
1991," shows two oil-producing rigs enclosed by a chain-linked fence 
topped with barbed wire, while out to sea, a couple of oil rigs loom in the 
distance. "Hwy. 101, Cardiff State Beach, noontime, 1993," shows 
vehicles traveling through smog so thick, headlights are required with 
hundreds of oil derriks pumping away in the background. 

Seewald is donating 50 percent of the proceeds from the sale of prints to 
the Sierra Club and the Clean Ocean Fund Drive. The other half will be 
used to produce 8' by 16' photo-murals of these futuristic views. They 
will be placed at strategic viewpoints along the coast. "Of course these 
images are not futuristic in the sense that they will exist, but that they 
could if we don't stop them," Seewald declares, "I have faith that the 
forces of evil will lose this battle. We have just begun to fight."

Red, white and 
by john .inah 

When Charles Camplin 
wrote about Chris Norris for 
The Los Angeles Times, he 
noted that not many people 
lead such dichotomous lives. 

He was doubdessly right, 
for walking into the office that 
serves as Norris' academic 
headquarters whi1e she 
instructs her UCSD humani-
ties classes, you don't notice 
anythilll that would suggest 
that the vibrant woman sitting 
at the desk and the woman 
who has been called one of the 
world's greatest living blues 
singers, are one in the same. 

Norris, 32, doesn't try to 
refute the glowing notices she 
consistently receives in her 
young career. She does her 
best to play them down. "I try 
to ignore any kind of publicity 
that interferes with my work 
and music," Norris explained, 
pushing aside a folder of 
freshly graded midterms, 
"And I've turned down lots of 
offers which involve 
compromises of the way I 
want to do music." 

short while in her late teens 
and early 205. That 
methodical style of singing, 
however ("it's always the 
same," she said about opera 
and pop), didn't appeal to her. 

But Norris became 
intrigued and ultimatley 
obsessed by the music of two 
blues greats, Bessie Smith and 
Ma Rainey. It is their songs 
which fill Norris' repertoire 
and their style which Norris 
loves. "Both of them," she 
said, "had very elemental and 
pure voices and I'm very 
interested in that. They were 
also great writers and 
performers of their music. 
"These blues are just 
fantastically made; better than 
anything written by men in 
the period." 

blues 
her mind. 

The music is so emotional 
that Norris said she often feels 
very vulnerable during 
performances. "The music is 
so intimate and charged with 
meaning. It's all about love, all 
about heartbreak, all about 
murder ... and I perform very 
improvisationally. " 

This improvisation is also 
what Norris said attracts her 
to teaching. 

Norris said that she began 
singing jazz and blues 
professionally just four years 
ago. She practiced opera for a 

The one detail, above all 
others, that Norris made sure 
to pick up from listening to 
these two greats was their 
improvisational style. Norris 
explained that "blue notes" 
can't reallly be transcribed, so 
she never looks at the music; 
rather, she immerses herself in 
her songs, listening to 
recordings over and over until 
they have become ingrained in 

Chris NorriJ sings herself inlO a comer 

"Teaching is really a lot -like 
jazz. You're working from a 
basic structure and you're 
playing with that structure. 
"And when I said (in the 
Champlin interview) that I 
sing myself into a corner, I 
meant doing something really 
crazy with the improvisation 
and then not being able to pull 
it off. But I've never fallen on 
my face," she smiled. Norris 
was quick to point out that 
while she takes pride in her 
singing and the rewards it has 
reaped so far, she remains 
dedicated to teaching - so 
much so that when offered the 
hypothetical choice: if a 
record label approached her 
and gave her complete 
freedom, would she relin~

Shorting out the screen 
by john ,inlh 

Expectations. They can 
really make the job of going to 
movies tough . Take for 
instance, John Badham's new 
film ShOTt Circuit. Since 
Badham is the director of such 
undeniably good films as 
Saturday Night FetJeT, Blue 
Thunder and War Games, one 
expecti his latest will be 
equally good. Wrong. 

And since Short Circuit is 
blessed with: one of the best 
and most massive advertising 
campaigns of recent years, the 
expect ations increase 
(actually this is not the best 

rule to follow; some ad 
campaigns are no more than 
last minute efforts to ward off 
disaster). Too bad. 

This is what is commonly 
referred to as a "high 
concept" film: the story is 
easily summarized and the cast 
is highly recognizable. Or, 
more concisely: a high-tech 
war robot is struck by 
lightning, becomes "human-
ized" and is hunted down by 
government bad guys in a film 
starring Ally Sheedy and 
Steve Guttenberg. 

It 's a cute story and one 

that, as I mentioned, is highly 
marketable . This time, 
unfortunately , "cute" and 
" marketable" don't translate 
into "good." 

One of Short Circuit's main 
problems, ironically, is in its 
casting, namely the perfor-
mance of Ally Sheedy. It has 
been sad to watch a young 
performer who started out so 
well in War Games and 
Breakfast Club deteriorate so 
rapidly. There are times in this 
movie (and in the just-
released Blue City, which she 
also stars in), when she seems 

nle great beers of the oorld go by one rtaJlle: Wwcllbr.iu. 8rCWl'<l in Munich.

SIe...e Guttenberg and All, Sheedy 
ger happy in Short CiTcuit 

to actually be reading off cue 
cards. 

Surely she is amible and 
likeable enough, but she is no 
match for Guttenberg, who 
again proves he can rise above 
any material and make it his 
own as he did so well in last 

year~s Ox:oon. 
Also at fault here is the 

screenplay by S.S. Maddock 
and Brent Wilson. The two 
previously worked together as 
a team writing cartoons for 
Chuck Jones. It shows. 

Cartoon-level is where this 
movie is at. Sure it's 
entertaining and mildly 
runny, but who really wants to 
sit through two hours of it? 
After II while, it gets irritating. 

Back to director Badham. 
His touch is not light as can be 
seen in any of this previous 
films. Action is his specialty, 
but Short Circuit has only one 
or two action scenes. In fact, 
for the great majority of the 
time, this film is completely 
and totally static. Badham 
seems to be bored with the 
film, and it rubs off on 
everyone: the performers, the 
robot and especially the 
audience. 

Perhaps what this film does 
best is fulfill an appetite. After 
all, three years have elapsed 
since the last Scar Wars movie 
and perhaps audiences are 
hungry for cute robots that 
save the day. 

Certainl y worse thi ngs 
could happen than ShOTt 
Circuit's succeeding; but if this 
is, as many have said, "one of 
the summer's best movies," 
then we are in for a lean 
season.

Continued from page 3 
quish her job as educator, she 
didn't miss a beat. "No. I 
don't think 1 could perform 
full time, and it would 
cheapen the music. But my 
ideal life would be to do both, 
say record during the summer 
and teach during the year. So' 
far I've been able to do both." 
(Her recordings can be found 
on Stomp-Off records and 
ordered through any Tower 
Records store.) 

Despite her undeniable 
success, Norris says she is 
considering a switch to the 
more upbeat sound of '50s 
and '60s jazz. "I've been 
wanting to sing a lot less 
unhappy songs lately."
