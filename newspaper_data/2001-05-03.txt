Janitors Rally for Wages 
Ozomatl i i nspi res students to march with workers 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

Hundreds of students joined activists and jani-
tors Tuesday afternoon in a loud and spirited rally 
to bring awareness to the needs of n'onunion jani-
tors at UCSD. 

"Here at UCSD, workers are exploited," said 
Cathy Medrano, an organizer for Students for 
Economic justice. She was referring to the 
nonunion janitors who are paid minimum wage 
and denied benefits such as insurance, sick days 
and the opportunity to organize. 

"Students can play an important role in the fight 
for all workers: Medrano added. 

The rally was part of UCSD Raza Awareness 
Week and was organized by SEJ, 

Studer:lts at the rally joined with Service 
Employees International Local Union 2028, which 
is currently assisting the janitors' fight. 

The janitors are employed by Bergesons and 
Merchants, a cleaning company from which UCSD 
contracts over 100 janitorial employees. 

SEILU 2028 Deputy Director Mike Wilzoch 
said that the janitors have three main demands. He 
said that they are asking to be paid a living wage of 
$11 .25 an hour, because their current wages put 
their families below the poverty line; that they need 
to be allowed to unionize; and that the janitors need 
respect and dignity fro m thei r employers and 
UCSD. 

According to the rally's organizers, Alejandra 
Rodriguez, an employee, was fi red when she 
attempted to organize her co-workers. Rodriguez 
briefly addressed the crowd through a translator. 

"We deserve respect like everybody else: 
Rodriguez said. 

UCSD-employed and unionized janitors 
showed support for their co-workers by attending 
the rally en masse and carrying signs that read, 
"The UC Works Because We Do" and "Equal Pay 
for Equal Work." 

Many students showed their allegiance to and 
respect for the janitors by attending the rally and

Watson 
Looks for 
New Plan 
Vice chancellor 
sti II seeks expanded 
university centers 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

As a result of last week's defeat 
of the Campus Life Fee 
Referendum, Vice Chancellor 
Joseph Watson is search ll1g for 
other ways to fund the expansion 
of the Price Center and Student 
Center that would not II1 volve 
increasing registration fees. 

"We have to take action to keep 
on moving." Watson said. "We haw 
to. prepare the campus for the 
10,000 more students we are going 
to have, and we can't wait until the 
last moment." 

Watson said yeste rday tha t he 
met With the other vice chancellors 
to discuss expanding the univnsity 
centers. Their immediate solution 
to the problem was to keep the 
funding for student servICes the 
same next year. 

This would enabk the .ldminis-
tratlon dnd the Reglstratl,)J] ret' 
Comnllttec to find a bcttn solution 
for the followlIlg year 

Watson s,lId that the plan he 
supportS requires cutting budgets 
in many student services such as 
,nhletics. recreation. health and 
disabilities by 10 percent start ing in 
the 2002-03 school year. 

In addi tion. he has said he 
wants to freeze the budgets of all 
student services, thereby keeping 
the allotment of money they 
receive from the school the same 
for the next four years. The grow-
ing student population along with 
the stagna nt budget would proVide

Wilson Wins First Nierenberg Award 
$25,000 prize, medal to honor the life and work of former Scripps director 
By DANA WEST 
Staff Writer 

The first Scripps Nierenberg 
Prize has been awarded to cele-
brated biologist E.O. Wilson. The 
award of $25,000 and a medal was 
created and funded by the 
Nierenberg family to honor the life 
and work of the former Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
director. 

Wilson will accept the 
Nierenberg Prize for Science in the 
Public Interest on Monday, May 
20 in a ceremony that will begin at 
4:30 p.m. in front of the Birch 
Aquarium. Wilson, who is a 

research professor and honorary 
curator in entomology at Harvard 
University, will also give a free 
public lecture. 

Scripps Institution Develop-
ment Officer Kirk Gardner, who 
coordinated the prize, said the 
selection committee's decision to 
give the award to Wilson was not 
difficult. 

"Out of 15 or 20 nominees, 
there was an instant focus on 
Wilson simply because of the 

m~gnitude of his work: Gardner 
said. â€¢ 

The prize honors Nierenberg 
by awarding scientists whose work 
is directly connected to the mis-

sion of the institution, which, 
according to Scripps Institution 
Director Charles Kennel, "is the 
search for a sustainable balance 
between the natural environment 
and human activity." 

Wilson's research, which 
includes evolutionary biology, the 
biology of social insects, the classi-
fication of ants, sociobiology, bio-
geography and ethical philosophy, 
personifies that mission. 

Gardner remarked, "[Wi lson] 
was really the first person to say, 
'Look, we need to stop worrying 
about what biology is doing to 
humans, and instead start worry-
ing about what humans are doing 

to biology.'" 
Wilson's books and kctures 

stimulate interest in scknce by 
demonstrating its importance in 
the everyday lives of humans. His 
concerns for the preservation of 
nature have put him at the helm of 
environmental activism. 

His lecture, "The Future of 
Life: will include the current sta-
tus and future of biodiwrsity. as 
well as the recent and prospective 
activities of the global conserva-
tion movement. 

Wilson has received many 
awards and honors in addi tion to

BRIEFLY 
WOtnlS Give Clues to Animal Development 

Scientists at UCSD have discovered a new 
class of genes in the roundworm C. elegans, 
which is responsible for the early stages of ani-
mal embryo development . 

Raffi V. Aroian , an assistant professor of 
biology who led the study, sought a better 
understanding of how the mechanisms of the 
genes work. 

The results of his study will be published in 
the May issue of the journal "Developmental 
Biology." The published findings indicate that 
the scientists have discovered how to regulate 
the cells in animal embryo development that tra-
ditionally divide asymmetrically, resulting in an 
unequally sized pair of cells. 

In a normal embryo, the larger cell dev.elops 
into the outer parts of the embryo, such as the 
skin, and the smaller cell develops into the inner 
parts of the embryo, such as the muscles. 

With unequal division, if one cell dies, the 
other cell is likely to die as well. The scientists' 
discovery, which are called pod genes, can 
cause the cells to divide equally, thus giving 
them a better chance for survival. 

The team's research was supported by the 
National Science Foundation, the March of 
Dimes Birth Defects Foundat ion and the 
University of California 's Cancer Research 
Coordinating Committee . . 

UCSD Scientists Identify Genes 
That Aid Kidney Development 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
have traced kidney development using DNA 
gene-chip technology and novel software. 

The study was conducted in the lab of Sanjay 
Nigam, professor of pediatrics and medicine, 
who currently holds the Nancy Kaehr Endowed 
Chair in Pediatric Research . 

The results of the study, which will be pub-
lished in the May 1 issue of Proceedints of the 
National Academy of Sciences, found the genes 
that become active and then shut "ff in the 
development of the kidney. 

The research was done using DNA fragments 
representing known sequences of genes and 
replicating them on silicon chips. By mingling 
these with rat RNA, the scientists achieved 

complimentary sequences, thus allowing them 
to map kidney function. 

The findings may someday lead to an ability 
to create an artificial kidney. 

The research was conducted at the UCSD 
departments of medic ine and pediatrics and the 
UCSD Cancer Center. It was funded by grants 
from the National Institutes of Health, the 
American Heart Associat ion and the Medicine 
Education and Research Foundation. 

Keck Foundation Gives $2M 
for New Imaging Facility 

The W.M. Keck Foundation has given UCSD a 
$2 million grant to help build a new UCSD Center 
for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. 

The state-of-the-art facility has already been 
planned in collaborat ion with The Salk Institute. 
With the new facility in place , researchers will 
be able to conduct sophisticated studies of the 
structure and function of the brain. 

The building , which will span 6,500 square 
feet , will be named the W.M. Keck Building. 

The fac ility will house four different imaging 
systems and will aid in the study of behavior, 
percept ion , memory, language and the abnor-
mal functions of the brain which manifest as 
disorders. 

Also unique about the center will be the abil-
ity for students at UCSD and surrounding insti-
tutes to observe in the research. 

The W.M. Keck Foundat ion was established 
in 1954 and has made a habit of contributing, 
money in the fields of physical and life science. 

Gordon Gill Named Interim 
Dean of Student Affair. 

Gordon Gill, who has been a professor at 
UCSD for 32 years, will serve as interim dean for 
scientific affairs for the UCSD School of 
Medicine. He will replace Nobel Laureate George 
Palade, who is retiring as dean, but remaining at 
the schoo1 as a professor emeritus. 

Gill, in addition to his tenure as a professor is 
the chair of the Faculty of Basic Biomedical 
Sciences, has been instrumental in the growth 
of medical research at UCSD.

Expansion: 
No recommendation 
made on how to fund it 
Continued from paC. 1 
the Price Center and the renova-
tion of the Student Center. 

The freeze would direct $15 
million toward university centers 
expansion during those four years. 

Watson said that this plan is 
only an idea and that he is open to 
other suggestions. He added that a 
final decision would not be made 
until next year. 

Members of the Registration 
Fee Committee have not decided 
what they will recommend to 
Watson. 

-"The real thing is that we really 
aren't sure what we are doing with 
this: said committee member 
Colin Parent. "We are talking to 
our consti tuencies next week." 

Parent said that a final decision 
concerning the budget over the 
funding of the Price Center could 
take weeks because many factors 
must go into the decision. 

Watson said that regardless of 
where the. money is coming from, 
he feels that the Price Center 
expansion is important because it 
will become more popular as 
UCSO's attc:ndance increases. 

"The Price Center is clearly 

impacted now: he said. "You go 
out there at lunch time and you 
can see the situation ,'Clearly there 
is a problem that needs to be 
addressed." 

Despite rejection of the referen-
dum last week, Watson has already 
allowed the planning of the Price 
Center expansion to begin . 

" I felt it was important to keep 
the project online so that we can do 
so;" he said. 

Many students are angered over 
what they feel is another of several 
vio lations of students' rights that 
have occurred in the last few weeks 
due to the fee referendums that 
have been proposed. 

" I can't believe the administra-
tion is actually going to do this," 
said Warren junior Josh Campton. 
"There was a reason that we voted 
down the last referendum. The stu-
dents spoke, but obviously that 
doesn't make a difference anymore. 
What we say obviously doesn't 
matter." 

Monday'S registration fee meet-
ing to discuss the matter of the 
funding for the Price Center was 
dosed to the public, thereby elimi-
nating the chance for students to 
express their opinions over the 
expansion of the Price Center. 

" I think Istudents] are going to 
be upset: Parent said. "Expansion 
without approval will be subversive 
of student opinion." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Watson said the problem is no 
longer whether the expansion pro-
ject will get funding, it is a matter of 
when it will get funding. 

"There's a problem at hand: he 
sa id. "One could prolong it or one 
could try to address it in some 
fashion . I have asked the 
Registration Fee Committee to 
consider this problem." 

The debate now is whether cur-
rent students should be paying for 
the expansion of the Price Center 
or if all funding should come from 
the students who will actually ben-
efit from it. 

Many students are outraged 
that they would have to pay for a 
project that won 't be completed 
until after they graduate. 

"Why on Earth should I be pay-
ing for this expansion?" asked grad-
uate student Todd Hamilton. " I 
work for my money and I don't feel 
like wasting it so that students four 
years from now will get to stand in 
shorter lines and order more kinds 
of food. Talk about a waste for me." 

Watson said he understands 
that current students may not ben-
efit directly from his plan . 

" I think their preference is to 
not make current students to fund 
the expansion because they will 
have graduated in four years: 
Watson said. "It is those students

Turnout is Highest 
in UCSD History 

Democracy is one of the most sought-
after forms of government in the world. It is 
a system founded on t.he voice of the people. 
When those people do not use that voice, 
then the idea of democracy loses its founda-
tion and the people relinq uish their rights. 
Because of this simple yet essential value, the 
Guardian is very pleased with the large voter 
turnout regarding the Campus Life Fee Ref-
erendum election. 

A record 6,231 undergraduate, graduate 
and medical students voted last week, con-
stituting approximately 33 percent of the 
school's 18,600 students. While the Guardian 
is disappointed that the referendum did not 
pass, we are pleased that .enough students 
turned out to have their voices heard and be 
counted. 

In the past, similar fee increases have 
received majority support from voters but 
failed to pass simply because voter turnout 
was not high enough. We cannot say 
enough about how important it is to vote, no 
matter which side one takes. 

Of course, the amazing turnout was no 
accident. Everywhere one looked, a 
reminder to vote could be seen, and the 12 
voting booths set up by the Associated Stu-
dents were impossible to miss. Only some-
one living in a cave would not have known 
about this election. Kudos to those who got 
the word out. 

Another reason why this election attract-
ed so many voters is that it dealt with money, 
which means it directly affected all returning 
students. Apparently, a fee increase was 
importan't enough to a third of the students 
here. 

We hope this turnout is a beginning, not 
an end. We wish that more people would 
have voted, but not because of the promise 
of cheap beer or free cookies. Students 
should vote because they understand that it 
is a privilege to have their voices heard. 

Realistically, we would be happy with a 
continued increase in voter turnout. If 33 
percent of the student body voted this year, 
why not 40 percent next time? Eventually, 
all 18,600 would vote. Now THAT would be 
a voice. 

We also wish students would turn out in 
these numbers to elect members of the A.S. 
Council. They too make a difference in cam-
pus life and are worth voting for. 

Once again, congratulations to the stu-
dents at UCSD - those who voted and 
those who got the word out. Let's continue 
the good work. 

The UCSD campus has long been consid-
ered apathetic, devoid of any political feeling 
whatsoever. Is this a turning point in the 
school's attitude? We would like to think so, 
but we'L! have to wait to see if that is the case.

America Must Confront Reality ofW~: 
Civilians Cannot Escape Unscathed 

Vietnam Veteran Bob Kerry's role in a massacre that killed 32 Vietnamese citizens 
should not shock citizens of a nation with an active history of warfare 

By VALERIE BURNS 
Staff Writer 

So what's all this hubbub about? For-
mer Kansas Senator and two-time Kansas 
Governor Bob KeITey shot some "Viet-
namese civilians" in 'Nam? Really 00' and 
why exactly does this surprise us? Why are 
we shocked? Is it the violence or the fact 
that these people were - wait for audience 
quieting - "civilians"? (Disclaimer: I say 
"civilians" in that they were not actual Viet 
Cong soldiers, although they were 
involved in Viet Cong organization and 
operation) . 

Who are we kidding? I'm not saying 
that we shouldn't mourn for the lives of 
the Vietnamese "civilians" who died, even 
though it was 32 years ago. War is war, and 
although we might not know it, war 
between two countries is no longer just 
between the two opposing armies. Civil-

. ians, no matter their degree of participa-
tion in the actual war, now have the "paiv-
ilege" of being included. I don't think any 
other country in the world would have had 
such a reaction to the information released 
about Kerrey. I will now discuss the rea-
sons for this. 

The American inability to think realis-
tically about war and what accompanies it 
has been a long time in coming. We 
haven 't had another nation fighting 
against us on our continent, otherwise 
known as a "land war," since the War of 
1812. Even then the British barely made 
an indentation in our eastern coastline. 

American civi lians don't have any 
knowledge of what it is like to be on both 
sides of the war. For the last two centuries, 
American civilians have seen only the 
escalation of manufacturing, excess of 
jobs and soldiers coming home during 
wartime. In Europe, every time there is a 
war, the civi lians suffer intensely because 
of it. The European countries are so close 
together that wars almost indiscriminately 
pierce each other's national borders. Eng-
land and France starved out German civil-
ians in World War I. All of Europe was 
bombed back in to the stone ages during 
World War II. Hey, remember Hiroshima? 
Yeah, those were civilians. 

Vietnam was a civilian war. The presid-
ing American congressmen and presidents 
half-assed it the whole time we were in 
Vietnam. We could've sent in nukes or 
devised ground troop escalation, in which 
case we might even have won the war. But 
the powers that be couldn't perceive the 
conflict as important enough to justify 
massive American dea!h. Only 58,000 
unnecessary American deaths would have 
to do. I mean, we were only trying to "con-
tain communism," not actually conquer 
the country. We wanted Vietnam to mimic 
Korea's neat little imperialist-drawn lines. 
You communists get over there, and we 
kind-hearted, blood-sucking capitalists 
will stay over here. Yeah, just like that. 
How Manichean. Because U.S. leaders 
refused to use nuclear technology or 
major ground troops to fight, it was a civil-
ian war. When Americans dive-bombed 
the Viet Cong, do you think tHey just 
killed the Viet Cong? Bombs don't have 
magnets that go straight to their targets. 
Three million Vietnamese died in the war 
- it's impossible that they were all sol-
diers. When one fights a war from afar, 
when you can't look the enemy in the eye 
(he or she was also underground), it's dif-
ficult to determine whom one is actually 
killing. 

One question: Wasn't Kerrey just fol-
lowing his orders of operation? Let us not 
forget that the way the Navy SEALs oper-
ate is not at all like college, where the 
statement of opinion and the execution of 
free will is central. Navy SEALs, especially 
under the conditions of battle, are expect-
ed to operate like machines. They are to 
receive and obey orders and not to provide 
their own opinion. Officers are supposed 
to assess situations, create orders and dis-
perse them. Why is it such a scary thing 
that KeITey took part in a raid operation on 
a Viet Cong village and killed those who 
lived there? Do we expect our political 
leaders to constantly have their heads in 
the clouds, politically and theoretically, not 
to be attached to reality at all? 

KeITey's encounter makes him all the 
more real to me. He embodies someone 
whom I would respect - not because he 
killed Vietnamese "civilians." God, no. It is 

because he was put into one of the most 
awful situations possible, Vietnam, and he 
dealt with it. Not only did he deal with it, 
he persevered and rode the ranks all the 
way to become a successful politician. 

I agree with the people of Kansas. I 
would want a man with real-life experi-
ence in war to represent iny wartime inter-
ests. I would be comfortable with a man 
who knows the hOITors of war to be 
responSible for deciding whether our 
nation should enter another one. 

What I think might really scare people 
about the Bob KeITey fiasco is how closely 
it hits home. Is it possible that such a dis-
tinguished man could have so much in 
common with all tho~e deranged home-
less Vietnam veterans we see onÂ·the streets 
everyday? I've seen them in La Jolla, and 
they're all over Sacramento, where I'm 
from. Wouldn't we like to think that Viet-
nam was so bad that only more honible 
things Iik.e being homeless could come out 
of it? 

Americans are such strict manicheans. 
Manicheans see things as only bad or only 
good; there is no gray area. Our nation has 
been programmed to think in such a way 
since the turn of the century, when 
Woodrow Wilson made the "world safe for 
democracy" and sent our boys to the 
trenches. I guess one could say it is in our 
Protestant nature. (Disclaimer: Although 
not all' of us are Protestant, we are all 
brought up with Protestant values 
through society and schooling). We Amer-
icans like to be fiffn in our thoughts, 
because firmness is a fertile environment 
for productivity. 

For situations like that of Kerrey's, I 
think a different kind of thinking is 
required. Such war-infested circumstances 
are not black or white; there is no obvious 
good and bad. It's the execution of orders 
trickling down into the trenches. Nothing 
is clear, nothing is concrete. Everything's 
gray. The cinematography in the movie 
"The Thin Red Line" depiCts war perfect-
ly. Some chaos, some order, dream-like, 
nightmare-like. colored, black and white. 
Are we really so sure about the objective of 
Wjlrs? The Vietnamese are not bad, right? 
Communism is bad, right? Right?

Prop 21 Unmasked: A War on Kids A Profitable Future 
Seen in Space Tourism 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

S hould children as young as 14 automatica lly be tried as adults for severe crimes, as 
mandated under Proposition 
21? 

I was hit with this question 
when an advertisement in the 
GlUlrdian caught my attention: 
Peaceful Anti -Proposition 21 
Rally. The ad stated, "A civilized 
society does not throw its most 
troubled children at age 14 to 
prison for life but tries to reha-
bilitate them by a juvenile justice 
system that is just and decent. 

oposition 21 is under chal-
eWge and we need as many peo-
ple to attend this rally, since it is 
critical in helping save Andy 
Williams, the suspect in the San-
tana High shootings, and other 
children like him." 

So the question I pose again is 
whether the automatic. mandato-
ry filing of a violent child offender 
in adult court is the right thing for 
our society to be doing? At what 
point do we as a society throw in 
the towel and give up on our 
"most troubled" children? At 
what age do we draw the line? 

Under Proposition 21, the 
law is crystal clear: All youth over 
age 14 who commit violent 
crimes in California are required 
to be tried as adults, regardless of 
the divergent circumstances. 

This Â·one size fits all" law is 
the wrong solution to reaching 
our society's goal of getting 
tougher on crime, for the cost -
the sacrifice of our troubled chil-
dren - is too high . 

Taking the decision of 
whether a child is to be tried as 
an adult out of a judge's impar-
tial hands and placing it instead 
into the co nviction-minded 
prosecutor's hands sels a dan-
gerous precedent, and only time 
will tell us the true damage that 
has been inflicted on our youth. 

I do not see Proposition 21 as 
an attempt to become tougher 
on crime, but as an attempt to 
extract pure vengeance on our 
troubled children at whatever 
the cost. 

I can understand the frustra-
tion of having repeat offenses by 
children who weren't reformed 
in the juvenile system, but does 
that condone making a law that 
serves to punish children indis-
criminately without the varying 
degrees afforded to any person 
under our law? 

I do not believe those argu-
ments of repeat juvenile offend-
ers are sufficient grounds for 
the existence of Proposition 21. 

A strong supporter of Propo-
sition 21, (ormer Governor Pete 
Wilson made a statement in 
1998 that is an indication of the 
vengeful spirit to punish child 
offenders: "Because young 
offenders know they can laugh 
off the token punishment of our 
current juvenile justice system, 
they commit more - and 
increasingly brutal - crimes. We 

must make clear to the violent 
youthful offenders - the ones 
who just don 't want to be saved 
- that California will not toler-
ate their depravity. It wi ll replace 
slaps on the wrist with the slap-
ping on of handcuffs .. . and will 
impose adult time for adult 
crimes." 

I'd like to ask a question of 
the es teemed former governor: 
Who are the "ones who just 
don't want to be saved"? Better 
yet, who is to determine who is 
beyond saving if the age is set at 
14 and the cri terion is any vio-
lent crime? 

It is clear that Proposition 21 
is a blanket law, in which the 
rights of children are completely 
erased. 

Just because a' lighter sen-
tence in juvenile court might 
lead to repeat offenders doesn't 
mean that we have the right to 
treat children as adul ts. Follow-
ing Wilson's logic. only when 
children are bad or violent are 
they considered adults; other-
wise, they are not afforded the 
same rights and privileges that 
come along with being an adult. 

So let me get this straight. 
When ch ildren are good and 
obedient to society's laws, they 
arc children; when they are bad 
and commit severe crimes they 
are adults? The logic doesn't fol -
low, Mr. Wilson . 

I believe Proposition 21 is a 
blatantly unfair and hypocritical 
law. It should be overturned 
before it is given the opportunity

Editor, 
As spring break came to an 

end, students were greeted back 
by signs denouncing the Greek 
populous at UCSD. Some stu-
dcnts have taken to littering the 
campus with inflammatory para-
phernalia with the words "lame" 
and "geek" written in pseudo-
Greek letters purchased at the 
General Store. I find it ironic that 
a campus which takes offense to 
intolerance in the form of "Anti-
Zionism" week and through 

protests supporting the repeal of 
affi rmative action, can sit back and 
ignore the offensive messages and 
castigations of UCSD's largest 
student organization. I question 
why this issue of intolerance has 
received no mention in the 
Guardian, or why the many accom-
plishments of the Greek system go 
unnoticed. 

Resentment toward Greeks has 
stemmed from allegations of elit-
ism and intolerance. This is fa lse 
and unjustified, with mu lti ple 
Asian and Latino Greek organiza-
tions, a Jewish heritage fraternity, 
and a higher percentage of black 
members in the Greek system than 
in the student population. The 
Greek system is possibly the most 
culturally diverse group upon the 
UCSD campus. Greeks encompass 
all demographics of the student 
body and few students can attest to 
not knowing a member in the 
Greek system. 

Though the Greek system does 
throw parties, it also participates 
in numerous philanthropic events 
and excels in academics and cam-
pus life. Greeks have raised nearly 
$20,000 toward chari ty and 
donated tens of thousands of col-
lective man-hours. Rece ntly, 
Greeks sponsored the EXCEL 
leadership conference that drew 
student leaders from across 
Southern California, ye t no men-
tion of this conference wi th an 
attendance of 700 ~eople was ever 
made in the Guardian. Greeks 
have consis tently held significant-
ly higher GPAs than the rest of 
campus, yet are regarded as buf-

DIVYA RUNCHAL 

R ecently, I've had the urge to drown my sorrows in a tub of Ben and Jerry's 
Chunky Monkey ice cream. You 
see, even though I'm taking an 
eating disorders class here at 
UCSD and know that bingeing on 
a quart of ice cream isn 't a good 
solution to my problems, I've real -
ized self-pity is a lot easier to swal-
low when it's accompanied by 
several hundred pounds of calo-
rie-laden chocolate. 

My hell began last week when 
I received an evaluation of an 
article I wrote ea rl ier in the year 
from a judge for the mother of 
all co llege journalism contests" 
the California Interco llegiate 
Press Association Awards. 

At first, I could barely restrain 
my excitement as I anticipated 
the warm reactions of the pan-
elists. I imagined them contact-
ing The New York Times and beg-
ging them to put me on their 
payroll. I soon became delirious, 
envisioni ng the acco lades I 
would receive from the literary 
world and my face - air-
brushed of course - on boxes of 
Wheaties. 

However, my dreams of 
achieving internationa l fame 
were quickly dashed wh en I dis-
covered that not only did the 
judge not li ke me, she thought 
my writing was crap. I bit my 
nai ls nervously as I looked over 
my scores. On a sca le of zero to 

ten , I received in the categories 
of writing quality, style, creativi-
ty, and reader appeal a 5, 2, 2, 
and a (drum roll please) zero. 
Zero? 1 couldn't believe it! Sure-
ly, I thought, there must be one 
reader on a campus with thou-
sands and thousands of people 
(probably even a hairy one who 
could identify with my deformi-
ty) who would find something 
appealing in my articles. 

You see, [ thought that 
if I delved into an 
engima that had 
captured my attention 
since freshmen year; I 
would be the biggest 
thing to hit this 
campus since Jamba 
juice. Two words: 
Dynes' Posse. 

The next few days were all a 
blur. I annoyed as many people 
as I could - some of whom did-
n't respond to me - by asking 
them if they thought I was as bad 
a writer as the CIPA judge 
thought 1 was. I prayed that a 
higher power would somehow 
take pity on me and show me the 
way. If 1 was not destined to be a 
detective or a high-class journal-
ist, what the hell was I going to 
do when I grew up? 

Sometimes my friends, bur-
dened by my complai nts and 
"woe is me" attitude, tried to get 
my mind back on track and

accomplish . I had spent countless 
moments scrutinizing the face of 
Chancellor Dynes plastered on 
stickers all over campus and try-
ing to understand the cryptic 
message accompanying his 
image: "Chancellor Dynes has a 
posse." 

I imagined various individuals 
running around ca mpus in the 
middle of the night , evading 
lurking CSOs and a frustrated 
police department, spreading 
their message all the way from 
Center Hall to Warren Lecture 
Hall. I decided I wou ld have to

mystery as interesting to me as

to get my detective juices flow-

Williams was automatica lly filed as

but not enough. 

All we need to do is make cor-
porations care abo ut wanting 
something better so they can offer 
a better product (and therefore 
gain more money) than their 
competitors. 

One of the reasons so many 
inventions and technological 
improvements are made during 
wartime is that there is a very real. 
palpable sense of competition .

he returns to Earth .

tried in adu lt court. Instead, 
Williams' fate was left solely in the 
avenging hands of the prosecutors, 
and the fairness and equality guar-
anteed to all under our law was 
denied to him. 

It is clear to me that when Cali-
fornia voters passed Proposition 
21, they didn't pass a bill tough on 
crime, they passed a bill that wages 
a bloodthirsty war on children: 
Lock them up and then throwaway 
the key for life. 

But don 't we as a society have a 
moral obligation to at least attempt 
to reform these troubled children? 
The way 1 view it , since they are 
children when they commit their 
crimes, we must also bear a mea-
sure of responsibility for their 
actions and thus should do all in 
our power to create a suitable sen-

When the Russians were going 
to send Tito to Mir, nobody 
objected. NASA, though it of 
course had no say in the matter, 
did not admonish against .it. But 
with Mir gone, Russia felt the 
need to honor Tito's contract with 
its space program and tran sfer 
Tito to the International Space 
Station. 

According to Tito, NASA did-
n't begin objecting until a few 
months before the actual launch 
was schedu led. But finally, just in 
the past week, NASA agreed to let 
Tito into the American part of the 
space station on a limited basis -
sort of like, "OK, we' ll let you in, 
just play nice." 

One of the benefits resulting 
from this flight is that it wi ll open

and the public to allow amateurs

tence that balances the need to 
punish with the need to rehabili-
tate. 

For when Williams or any other 
child turned to violence as his sav-
ior, that act can only be viewed as a 
desperate act - a cry for help. 
These children may have given up 
on society when they pulled the 
trigger, but that violent act doesn't 
au tomatically preclude our duty to 
not give up on them unless all 
attempts at reform are exhausted . 

The ultimate question remains: 
What punishment is a child 
offender entitled to? Is the child 
entitled to automatic life enprison-
ment, or is the child entitled to the 
possibility of a second chance afta

relate it back to the C01"111110n per-

their way, all private citizens frolll 
the rich walks of life will be able 
to go to space given their determi-

But maybe some day, hopefully 
some day soon, the corporations 
will take hold of this idea and 
allow people like you and me to 
save up a few thousand do llars

just outside of the earth's atmos-

Crackdown on Rebels Highlights 
Philippines' Fragile Democracy 

MAN ILA , Philippines - In 
the heady days after Gloria 
Macapagal Arroyo swept to power 
in January, members of the church 
and business elite were willing to 
overlook the means of her ascent 
from the vIce presidency - a pop-
ular uprising that short-circuited 
the kgal process. 

On Wednesday. she used the 
"state of rebellion" she imposed 
after Tuesday's angrier and less 
successful uprising agai nst her 
own ru le to widen a crackdown on 
opposi tion leaders whom she 
accused of inciting the violence. 
That move left even her own sup-
porters fearing that the abrupt 
ouster of her predecessor, Joseph 
Estrada, had set a dangerous 
precedent in the Philippines' still 
young democracy. 

Political leaders and commen-
tators said the siege mounted on 
the presidential palace early 
Tuesday by loyalists of Estrada. 
who is in jail . had its roots in the 
protests that forced him from 
offi ce ea rly this year. Those mass 
demonstrations, and the ouster, 
occ urred befo re a verdict was 
reached in Estrada's impeachment 

Fewer than 40,000 
protesters marched 
on Malacanang Palace 
on Tuesday, but by the 
time they were dispersed 
by riot troops, at least 
three people were dead, 
and Arroyo declared 
a 'state of rebellion' 
here in the capital. 
trial on corruption charges. 

"There is a danger now that if 
you mass 100,000 or 1 million 
people on the streets, it can topple 
the government," said Aquilino 
Pimentel , the president of the 
Senate, who presided over 
Estrada's abortive trial. 

Fewer than 40,000 protesters 
marched on Malacanang Palace 
on Tuesday, but by the time they 
were dispersed by riot troops, at 
least three people were dead, and 
Arroyo declared a "state of rebel-
lion" here in the capital. 

On Wed nesday, the police 
arrested Ernesto Maceda, a for-
mer ambassador to the United 
States. They also intensified a 
manhunt for two other opposi-
tion leaders. 

Arroyo said she hoped to lift 
the state of rebellion, which allows 
suspects to be arrested without a 
warrant, by May 7 - a week 
ahead of key congressional elec-
tions that represent the first ballot 
box test of her rule. She reaffirmed 
that she would not declare martial 
law, but she warned her foes not 
to provoke her. 

The tough talk cheered the 
stock market and lifted the 
Philippine peso. But it left even 
the president's supporters uneasy 
- particularly as the streets of 
Manila were indisputably tranquil 
on Wednesday. 

"The administration seems to 
be pursuing some shortcuts in 
restoring order," Pimentel said. "[ 
am not too sure, in all honesty, 
that a state of rebellion rea lly 
exists in Manila right now."

Aid Denied to Students with Drug Convictions 
WASH[NGTO - When a 

judge pronounced Russell Selker 
guilty of smoking marijuana in a 
car in December 1999, the fresh-
man at Ohio State University 
thought he left the courtroom 
knowing his sentence: a $250 fine, 
suspension of his driver's license, 
20 hours of com munity service 
and a year's probation. 

But a month later, when Selker 
applied for financial aid for the 
coming academic year. he faced 
another sentence: the loss of his 
eligibility for low-interest federal 
education loans and grants. 

- I was amazed," said Selker. of 
Cincin nati . "It 's like two penalties 
for the same crime." 

Under a law passed in 1998, 
which is being fully enforced for 
the first time by the Bush admin-
istration, students convicted on 
drug charges become ineligible for 
federal financial aid and loansfor 
one year after a possession con-
viction. or for two years after a 
convic tion for selling drugs, 
unless they undergo a rehabilita-
tion program that includes two 
random urine tests. Repeat 
offenders can face permanent loss 
of federa l assistance to attend col-
lege. 

;\10 other crime carries such a 
provision. Gov. Gary E. Johnson 

"You can rob a bank, 
you can commit murder, 
just about any other 
crime and not be denied 
student aid, but a drug 
charge would deny you 
student aid. " 

- Gary E. Johnson 
New Mexico governor 

of New Mexico, who has spon-
sored state legislation to decrimi-
nalize possession of small 
amounts of marijuana. said, "You 
can rob a bank, you can commit 
murder, just about any other 
crime and not be denied student 
aid, but a drug charge would deny 
you student aid." 

Others complain that the law is 
biased against the poor, who rely 
on the aid, and blacks, who make 
up a disproportionate percentage 
of those arrested on drug charges. 
While about 13 percent of the 
people taking illicit drugs are 
black, the same as their propor-
tion in the general popu lation , 
blacks represent 55 percent of the 
drug convictions, said David 
Borden, executive director of the 

Drug Reform Coordination 
Network. 

Of nearly 10 million financial 
aid applications fi led last year, 
9,200 students lost fina ncial aid 
for college for part or all of the 
academic year because of the law. 
Another 279,000 left blank the 
question about drug offenses and 
were given the aid anyway, 
prompting complaints that the 
federal government was punishing 
some students for their honesty. 

The Department of Education 
is now instructing students that 
answering is mandatory and that 
it will deny aid to students who 
ignore the question . 

The law's sponsor, Rep. Mark 
Souder, R-[nd., says the purpose 
of the law was to hold students 
receiving federal financia l aid : 
accountable and ensure that they 
did not become involved with 
drugs. 

"If my son goes to a party and 
he doesn't have the courage to 
say, ' No, [ don 't want to smoke a 
joint,' he can say, ' No, [ could lose 
my student loan,'" Souder said. 
"[t's not actually a good example, 
because my son is not on scholar-
ship."

Bush: . 
Committee votes 
to overturn policy 
Continued from page 1 
the White House, Democrats on 
the House [nterflational Relations 
Committee won enough support 
from Republican backers of abor-
tion rights to overturn the Bush 
abortion policy in the $8.2 billion 
State Department authorization 
bill. 

At issue was .the "Mexico City 
policy" that Ronald Reagan and the 
elder George Bush imposed during 
their administrations. Clinton, as 
one of his first official acts in 1993, 
overruled that policy, which bans 
federa l aid to family planning 
groups that use their own money to 
perfo rm or "actively promote" 
abortions. 

On his third day in office this 
year, Bush restored his Republican 
predecessors' approach, which is 
named for a 1984 population con-
ference in the Mexican capital 
where the Reagan administration 
announced it. 

On Wednesday, the committee 
voted 26-22 for an amendment 
overturning the Bush administra-
tion policy. Democrats, who voted

ple of an increasingly common tac-

as a bloc, were joined by three 
Republicans - Benjamin A. 
Gilman of New York, Amo 
Houghton of New York and Jim 
Leach of Iowa. 

The likelihood that the new lan-
guage will survive in the full House 
is not high, lawmakers in both par-
ties acknowledged. There is a sepa-
rate move to raise the issue in the 
Senate, where sponsors hope they 
can overrule Bush as well. 

House Republicans were confi-
dent that they would strike the new 
language, but they also warned 
Democrats that by raising abortion 
in the spending bill they were 
putting at risk a compromise to pay 
back dues to the United Nations. 
For years, it had been Democrats 
who cri ticized Republicans for 
tying U.N. fi nancing to abortion 
politics. 

Democrats saw Wednesday's 
vote, even if it is later reversed, as 
an important symbolic victory. Last 
week, advocates of abortion rights 
suffered a setback when the House 
approved a bill that would establish 
criminal penalties for harming a 
human fetus during the commis-
sion of a federa l offense against a 
woman.

White House and Congress Agree on Budget Increase 
WASH I0:GTOl'\ - II day after 

,lgrwllg to cut taxes by $1 .35 tril-
lion over the next 11 yea rs, the 
While I lOll e dnd congressiona l 
negotiators 011 Wednesday se ttled 
on a spending increase for next 
year. The Increase is greater thim 
whdt Prcsldent Bu h had sought 
but less than what most Democrats 
s,lId was nceded to pay for domes-
II C programs and the military. 

The deal was criticized by 
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, 
but won the support of a handful 
of moderate Democrats whose 
votes the administration, needs to 

get th e measure through the even-
ly divided Senate. 

The agreement, the final major 
piece of the first budget plan of 
Bush 's presidency, ca lled for an 
II1crease in spending of just under 5 
percent on those programs whose 
budgets arc set by Congress each 
year. including the Pentagon and 
most domestic initiatives outside of 
Social Security and Medicare. 

Bush had sought to limit the 
increa e in those programs to 4 per-
cent next year after an increase of 8.5 
percent in the current fiscal year. 
The initial plan passed by the Senate 

last month would have increased 
spending by more than 8 percent. 

The increases would bring 
spending on the programs next 
year to $666.6 bi llion, up from 
$635 .4 bi llion this year. Of that 
amount, $324.8 bi ll ion would go to 
the military and $341.8 billion to 
domestic programs. The total bud-
get for the year, including 
Medicare, Social Security and 
interest payments on the national 
debt, will come to slightly less than 
$2 trillion. 

[t appeared that the compro-
mise stripped from the budget out-

line much of the increase in educa-
tion spending that the Senate had 
origi nally supported. It retained 
plans for long-term increases ' in 
spending on agriculture, and pro-
vided up to $300 billion over the 
next decade for adding prescription 
drug coverage to Medicare. 

The deal on the spending level 
for next year came a day after the 
negotiators had agreed that the 
budget plan would call for a tax cut 
of $1 .25 trillion over the next 
decade, plus another $100 billion 
in immediate tax cuts during this 
calendar year to give a boost to the 

flagging economy. Bush had 
sought a tax cut of $1 .6 trillion . 

The president held up the bud-
get agreement on Wednesday as 
evidence that he can build biparti-
san coalitions to back his agenda, 
saying the deal was the result of 
hard work by members of 
Congress "who realized that what 
we're talking about is not partisan 
politics, but good budget politics, 

, good budget policy."

The march began in the Price

the Administration Complex after 
winding through

together and banged on drums. 

The march was preceded by a 
concert by Ozomatli. The socially

port fo r the janitors' cause with a 
set of songs calling fo r social jus-
tice. A rendition of "We're Not 
Going. to Take it" drew applause 
and cheers fro m the crowd. 

Many students came to Iisterr 
to the popular band, but stayed 
for the rally after learning of the 
situation. 

"I came fo r both the music and 
ra lly," said student Bella Oguno. "I 
think it's unfair - we are paying 
for [the janitors) to be poor." 

Others were already aware of 
the workers' concerns. 

"Minimum wage is too low for 
anytfody to make a living," said 
student Matt Wi lliams. "Plus, no 
benefits or insurance is especially 
hurtful." 

The campus came alive for

that face San Diego.

College: 
Idea for the minor 
came two years ago 
Continued from ...,. 1 
the department of sociology. 
"Classes include everything from 
English to justice studies to psy-
chology to sociology: 

Johnson said that interest in 
creating a minor in LGBT studies 
surfaced about two years ago. It 
evolved fro m an initiative from the 
dean from the College of Arts and 
Sciences to identify and promote 
interdisciplinary studies. 

Besides two required courses 
for the minor, Introduction to 
LGBT Studies and Individual 
Investigation, two blocks of cours-
es offer an array of classes that can 
be tailored to fit a student's partic-
ular interest. 

Classes in the firs t block are 
specifically geared toward study 
about homosexuality. Some of 
these are The Novels of Pierre Loti, 
Sociology of Gays and Lesbians, 
and Development of Gender Role 
and Identity. These classes are held 
in modern and classical language 
studies, sociology and psychology, 
respectively. 

The second block incl udes 
classes that may not necessarily 
deal exclusively with homosexuali-
ty but devote a portion of class time 
to sexuality issues. Courses include 
five from sociology, two from 
health education and one each 
from justice studies, political sci-
ence, an thropology and American 
studies. 

Other classes will be added as 
special topics courses that can be 
used toward the minor wi th per-
mission from the program coordi-
nator. 

"This minor creates some new 
cou rses but packages existing 
courses into a way so it can be a 
transformed into a minor," 

Johnson said. "If any class in any 
discipline looks like. it could be 
used for the minor, we'll call the 
department. Even if one day a 
physics class or a biology class 
looks interesting, we'll call." 

Johnson strcsses that the minor 
is not only for gays or bisexuals but 
also for anyon e seeking more 
information on nontraditional sex-
uality. 

Johnson, with Molly Merryman 
and Andrew London, Kent State 
instructors who also helped plan 
the minor, wrote in an interdepart-
mental letter that studying minori-
ty sexuality leads to questions 
about sexuality in general.

UCLA Professor Flies 
Suit Against UC, 
Administrators 

LOS ANG EL ES - For one 
UCLA professor, the past five years 
have been an endless nightmare. 
Now. at age 76 , Andras 
Bodrogligeti sa id he only wants to 
reclaim two things - his students 
and his reputation. 

Wcdnesday, at a status confer-
ence over his pending discrimina-
tion laws ui t in Santa Monica 
Mun icipa l Court, Bodrogligcti 
hopes Superior Court Judge Robert 
M. Letteau grants him a court datc. 
and the opportunity to tell his story 
to a jury. 

Bodrogligeti, who has taught 
Turkish studies at UCLA to more 
than 8,000 students fo r over three 
decades, alleges that high-ranking 
university admin istrators have tried 
to coerce him into resignation to 
elimi nate the Turkish studies pro-
gram and make way fo r their own 
"political agenda." 

"What they wanted to do was 
shut down a program," said 
Attorney Diana Corteau, who rep-
resents the professor. "In order to 

The UCSD Guardian 

do that, they had to discredit the 
man who created it." 

On Dec. 21,1999, Bodrogligeti 
filed a lawsuit against the Regents 
of the University of California, 
claiming an invasion of privacy and 
age/race discrimination under Title 
IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

The regents maintain that 
Bodrogligeti 's allegations are 
untrue and that the university feels 
confident in its position to fight 
this suit. 

"The bulk of the case has been 
dismissed - there's very little that 
remains," said Jeff Blair, university 
counsel for the UC Regents. "I 
don 't believe there 's any evidence 
that the university has done any-
thing improper." 

Attorneys Alan Zuckerman and 
Julie DeRose have been retained by 
the UC Regents as well. 

"The university denies all alle-
gations: Zuckerman said. 

Pauline Yu, dean of humanities, 
Antonio Loprieno, chair of the 
Near Eastern Language and 
Cultures Program, and Cary Porter, 
associate dean of students, among 
others, were also named in the suit 
for their alleged involvement. 

The suit was amended Monday 
to include a due process violation 
and defamation allegedly commit-
ted by Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Personnel Norman 
Abrams for a letter about the pro-
fessor sent ' to California 
Assemblyman George House. 

Administrators are declining to 
talk about the case, citing UC poli-
cy that prohibits them fro m speak-
ing about pending lawsuits. 

"It 's practice and policy not to 
comment on cases that are going to 
lit igat ion," said Robert Nap les, 
dean of students. 

Bodrogligeti is the same pro-
fesso r who exposed the la rgest 
orga nized chea ting incident in 
recent UCLA history. Th irty stu-
dents were caught cheating by 
two of Bodrogligeti's proctors in 

an elementary Uzbek language 
course during a final exam in fall 
1996.

Sex Doesn't Do It 
for Some Students, 
CDC Reports 

COLLEGE PARK, Md. -
University of Maryland freshman 
letters and sciences major Julia 
Grisar is an average college stu-
dent. She spends time with friends, 
studies and has various hobbies. 
But unlike 86 percent of ~er fellow 
college students, she is sexually 
abstinent. 

"My decision to be sexually 
abstinent had nothing to do with 
religion or past experiences: Grisar 
said. "Engaging in sexual inter-
course with someone is like shar-
ing the most intimate part of your 
very being. It's practically the clos-
est thing yoti can get to sharing 
your soul with another person." 

Grisar is one of a growing num-
ber of teens and people ages 18 to 
25 deciding to remain abstinent, 
either on a prolonged or limited 
time frame. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Health, 50 percent of high school 
students graduate as virgins, an . 
increase from 45 percent a decade 
ago. 

About 2.5 million teens and 
college students nationwide have 
taken the "virginity pledge." 
Friends First, a sexual abstinence-
based group in Colorado, gives 
discounts to teens on SLlch things 
as tae kwon do lesso ns and 
McDonald's as an added incentive 
to stay abstinent. Students for 
Life, an abstinence-based group 
at the University of Louisiana, is 
against abortion and contracep-
tion , and also promotes sexual 
abstinence. 

nue Love Waits, a Christian 

Thursday, May 3, 2001 

abstinence-based aSSOCiatiOn , 
challenges high school and col-
lege students to "make the right 
and radical choice of sexual puri-
ty: The pledge says a person will 
not have sex until a "Biblical" 
marriage. 

"I don't find it hard marketing 
abstinence to teen and college-age 
people, because they can recognize 
the detrimental results of being 
sexually active," said Jimmy Hester, 
coordinator of True Love Waits. 
"These young people are challeng-
ing our society to rethink. our stan-
dards and expectations related to 
sexual issues." 

Social organizations are not 
the only measures taken to dis-
suade teens and college students 
from having sex. Title V of the 
1996 Welfare Reform Act set aside 
$50 million per year for absti-
nence-only education in public 
schools. Since the implementa-
tion of the act in 1998, 23 percent 
of American high-school students 
have received abstinence-only 
education . 

Sexually tlansmitted diseases 
are another reason some people 
choose to abstain from sexual 
intercourse. More than one-third 
of college students have had sex 
with six or more partners in their 
lifetime, according to a study by the 
Center for Disease Control. Two-
thirds of all STDs occur in people 
25 years old or younger, and less 
than half of adults ages 18-44 have 
been tested for an STD, according 
to the American SocifJl Health 
Association. 

GrisarÂ·said she feels young peo-
ple choosing to be abstinent are a 
strong and growing force. 

"I'd say that seven or so of my 
close acquaintances all fee l the 
same way that I do about sex: 
Grisar said. "I think I'm fortun ate 
to have found so many who share 
this belief."

Out from the boondocks, Anya Morino tokes her 
indie-pop beat to the Son Diego music scene 

Funny and melodic, Anya Marina has a gentle voice and a quick sense of humor that can charm . just about anyone. How-
ever, growing up, Marina was always 
told to keep her mouth shut. 

"I was always told I shouldn't 
sing and ... that my voice was real-
ly bad," Marina said. 

Fortunately she did not listen. 
The first-born of Russian immi-

grants, Marina grew up on a moun-
tain in rural Northern California. 

"I grew up way up in the boon-
docks with like three dogs and 18 
cats and a perennial case of poison 
oak," Marina joked. "There was no 
junior high on the mountain so I 
went down to the valley and real-
ized I had no style, no friends, no 
social ability" 

From this unusual background, 
it is easy to see that Marina was des-
tined to becom~ a songwriter. 

Marina is just as much a stand-
up comedian as she is a musician 
when on stage, but don't let all her 
humor fool you. Her mu sic, which 
she says has been influenced by 

everything from Russian folk 
music to The Beatles, has sub-
stance. 

"I try and not write about flow-
ers and clouds," she said. 

In a song called "Sociopath," 
Marina sings of how she is "patho-
logically addicted to what we ca ll a 
dick-head ." Hmmm, can you relate? 

Surprisingly, Marina is not an 
old pro at the singer-songwriter 
thing. She has only been writing 
and performing since she moved 
to San Diego, which was three 
years ago. There, she joined a 
community of talented musicians 
who have embraced her with open 
arms. 

"When I moved to San Diego, I 
met up with a group of really cool 
people" Marina said. "One of them 
was Steve Poltz, who was like, 
'you're really good - you need to 
keep playing.' So I did, and here I 
am almost three years later, and I've 
written a ton of songs." 

Surely Marina has a long and 
wonderful career ahead of her. 
However, this songstress has no 
interest in becoming a rock star. 

"I actually don't like that side of 
it at all," she admitted. "I'd love to 
have a goo.d little indie career. I'd 
love to be able to eventually play 
theaters." 

Marina is currently working on 
an album, but for now you can 
check her out online at: 
http://www.mp3.comianyamarina 

Proving again that the best things 
often exist in our own backyard, 
Marina is a gem of the San 6iego 
music SCene. Anyone with musical 
taste should visit her Web site for 
information about upcoming shows. 
She will surely turn you into a fan 
with her self-described style of 
"smart, indie-sounding pop." 

Anya Marina will perform at Java

Queen's Bridge Finest 
"OSF" 

11/ Will Records 
C 

Nas, with 1I1 Will Records, has released a 
compilation album featuring the best rappers 
from Queen's Bridge, N.Y., known as 

Queen's Bridge Finest. 
The first half of the songs on the album 

are typical hard-core rap songs. They talk 
about who the album is for, where the album 
is coming from, how tough they all are and 
how great they have become both monetari-
ly and sexually. The usual. 

The introduction ("Intro") is a good 
example of how to annoy the listener. Jungle 
and Wiz explain which hoods the album will 
go to. They list geographical locations. Places 
mentioned are North and South Carolina, 
the coasts, Montana, Salt Lake City, all of 
Utah, Florida, Alabama, etc. YOll get the idea. 
They're very good at this. 

"Oochie Wally" is a sex song. It 's explicit, 
which is expected. But often these types of 
songs are redeemed by wit and/or some form 
of comical anecdote. This one lacks either; 
instead, it is vulgar and crass. The chorus 
features wOipen who say "he really really 
really fucked my coochic." 

Ah,love. 
Despite these bad moments, the album 

does manage to save itself from hitting bot-
tom. Rap stands for "rhythm and poetry" and 
it's in the second half that the album gets its

Sneak Preview: Radiohead 
A track-by-track listing of the band's latest album, 
'Amnesiac,' promises for more radio-friendly tunes 
By JOSEPH LEE 
HIatus EdItor 

It hll1k R.ldiohead three Yl'ars 
to tinallv r~kase last fall's -Kid 11.." 
"OW, l~ss than a year later, the 
band IS pOised to release its next 
,lnldzlng ,llbum, "Amnesiac." They 
promised more radio-friendly 
tunes, and hert' they are. 

.\ sneak preview for "Amncsi -
dC" was presented by SRTV and 
C.lplll11 Rt'cords last Sunday. Here 
IS a q LIIck track by track preview: 

1, "Packt Uke Sardines in a 
Crushd Tin Box" 

TIllS IS "pop" for Radiohcad -
a ca tchv breakbeat and a series of 
electronic noises. And is that 
someone hitting a can of water in 
the background? 

2. "Pyramid Song" 
Tl1lS song was introduced dur-

ing Radiohead 's European tour 
last year. A soft piano opens the 
song wllh a bit of an "Exit Music" 
vlbe to It. The drums kick in with 
J mcandaingpzz beat. 

3. "Pulk/ Pull Revolving Doors" 
Hard distorted drum samples, 

distorted voca ls from Thom Yorke, 
and ye t somehow they make it all 
work. This one could definitely 
have made it onto "Kid A." 

4. "You and Whose Army?" 
Guitars are finally featured on 

this song along with the mournful 
sound of Yorke's voice, but the 
song builds into a wash of drums 
and piano. Even though it's just 
over three minutes long, it could be 
one of the best tracks off the album. 

5. "I Might Be Wrong" 
This could be dance music for 

Radiohead, featuri ng electron ic 
drum beats under a bluesy guitar

riff, and of course, Yorkc 's floating good bear hunting song. 
vocals. 

6. "Knives Out" 
Did you like Radiohead's first 

album, "Pablo Honey"? This song 
could tit on that one, but it's defi-
nitely more polished than any-
thing off "Pablo Honey." This is 
the closest you'll get to old R.1dio-
head. 

7. "Amnesiac/Morning Bell" 
This is basically "Morning 

Bell" from their last album, but 
without the drums. The result is a 
haunting lullaby - and you can 
actually hear what Yorke is say-
ing. 

8. "Dollars & Cents" 
The strings are definitely from 

the "Kid A" sessions and that 
wonderful jazz beat on the drums 
is back. 

9. "Hunting Bears" 
There is a slightly delayed and 

distorted guitar riff that plods 
throughout the song. The key-
board slowly holds out notes .. . a 

10. "Uke Spinning Plates" 
Listen carefully: those are 

turntables at the beginning. The 
rest of the song is a wave of elec-
tronic soundscapes and virtually 
unrecognizable vocals from Yorke. 
The -strings push it to almost a 
soundtrack-like quality before the 
song slowly fades out. 

11. "Ufe In A Glass House" 
The jazz themes floating about 

the entire album come into full 
play here. Yorke is not a jazz 
singer, but once again, Radiohead 
makes the song work. There is a 
New Orleans-style jazz band that 
makes up the entire song with 
clarinets, pianos and horns build-
ing up to cacophony of beautiful 
noise by the end. 

"Amnesiac" is slated to be 
released June 5. Accompanying 
the album will be a 24-page book-
let, 32 pages in the special-edition 
release. The songs from "Amnesi-
ac" were spawned from the' "Kid 
A" sessions.

Cafe on the Park 
Serves Satisfaction 
Hearty midwestern food from turkey pot 
Â·pie to a bowl of Captain Crunch 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Staff Writer 

For a food experience of a unique 
nature, venture to the edge of Hill-
crest for the Cafe on Park. Parking is 
atrocious and seating space is limit-
ed, serving a maximum of 35 people, 
but it's all worth the experience of 
eating there. 

Decorated in a simple art deco 
motif, the floor is unfurnished con-
crete (for now) and amenities are 
kept simple. Exemplary of its unique 
style, Cafe on Park uses mason jars 
as glasses. To add to the ambiance, 
there is always local art on exhibit, 
which owner Andy Haenfler doesn't 
help choose. 

"[ know what [ like, and if it was 
up to me, that's all that would get 
put up," Haenfler said. "So, some 
mornings [ come and am complete-
ly shocked at what's on my walls." 

The Cafe on Park has a different 
approach to decision making and 
what to serve. The decisions for 
menu items are completely democ-
ratic. Everyone from the busboys up 
get to have a say in what ends up on 
the menu. 

"Everyone gets together at my 
house and we ta lk about what the 
customers have told us about the 
menu: Haenfler said. 

The outcome is -a tasty and 
unique result that remains quite 
inexpensive. The food reflects what 
Haenfler calls "typical hearty, down-
home, Midwestern food." For exam-
ple, the breakfast menu carries a 
"large bowl of Captain Crunch" 
($3.50). That's about as normal- or 
perhaps, as predicable - as most 
items get. 

Corresponding to the atmos-
. phere of this quaint cafe, familiar 

menu items are often given an 
inspiring rwist. Pancakes, for exam-
ple, come in varieties including 
Banana-Chocolate and Blackberry-
Cornmeal (both $3.25). One pan-
cake literally covers the entire plate, 
and that's without any side dishes. 

There is also the Mexican Hash 
($6.95), which includes jalapeiios, 
onions, tomatoes and potatoes, pan-
fried with mozzarella. Served with 
black beans and tortillas, this is a fill-
ing and delicious meal. Therc are 
several other kinds of hash, omelets, 
pancakes and waffles, all of which 
sound delectable_ 

Nothing on the breakfast menu 
is more than $8, and everything is in 
huge portions, promising a take-
home box. The lunch menu is simi-
lar in price range, though the cap is 
about $10. The lunch selection is 
just as varied as bre~kfast, offering a 
lot of sandwiches, burgers, salads 
and pastas. 

The dinner menu is more 
expensive but still very reasonable, 
with the more extravagant items 
around $15. The appetizers and 
salads have flare and excitement. 
The entrees match the standard of 
excellence set up by the rest of the 
menu . The Turkey Pot Pie ($9.50) 
is as delicious as it is infamous - it 
has been noted in several other 
reviews_ Those looking to go simple 
should try the Grilled Corn-o-Cob 
($10.95). 

The Cafe on Park is strongly rec-
ommended. You just can't go wrong 
with the food or the prices. Just 
make sure you come hungi)', and 
you will be satisfied.

The Luzhin Defence 

Who would have thought that a 
period drama could be this BBC-
esque, and still entertaining? 

At the center of events is a chess 
tournament, and circling around 
this fountain of passion and insan-
ity is a love affair between an 
eccentric chess player Uohn Tur-
turro) and a rebellious, upper-class 
woman (Emily Watson) . The latter 
is reminiscent of what might have 
happened to the character Rose 
from "Titanic: that is, of course, ' 
had she not been on the Titanic. 

Watson does a decent job of por-
traying the Russian Natalia, but the 
real treat is Thrturro, who truly 
shines in his performance of 
Luzhin, a genius trapped in his own 
mind by circumstances and ruthless 
people who have exploited his tal-
ent. 

Filmed on location in haly and 
Hungary, this film will make you 
long for Europe even if you've never 
been there_ The dancing, sophisti-
cated atmosphere pulls you in and 
hClps you suspend your disbelief 
enough to ignore the well-known 
fact that Russian society does not 
really speak perfect English. 

III Will: 
Album flops with too 
many contradictions 
Continued from paC. 13 
"A" and "P." 

"Street Glory," "Self-Con-
science" and "Kids in da PJs" are all 
songs with feeling and thought. 

A well-directed drama by heavi-
ly awarded Mar[een Gorris unfolds 
around the two main characters. 
The fight for Luzhin's mind and 
life heats up as he is about to 
become a chess champion. 

On one side is Natalia, who sets 
out to save his sanity. On the other 
side is Va[entinov, the man who 
brought Luzhin to fame and then 
to ruin as a chess player. He IS 
obsessed with keep ing Luzhin 
from victory. 

The driving force of the story, 
however, is Luzhin 's own undying 
passion for chess, tangled up with 
his traumatic childhood, which he 
flashes back to on the screen of his 
mind. 

If you never thought you'd be 
excited about a romance again after 
your expectations were disastrous-
ly sunk with the aforementioned 
"Titanic: and if you never really 
understood why people get into 
chess, this film might just change 
your mind. 

The patterns of rise to fall, 
attack to defense and black against 
white are repeated through the rich 
texture of the story, and you come 
out refreshed, wishing you were in 
Northern Italy sipping your drink 
at a holiday resort. 

- LissAnda 

The music is either tranquil Dr 
nostalgic and the lyrics actually 
have a theme to them. 

There's a contradiction in many 
rap albums these days. It's as though 
the rapper must be explicit and con-
ceited in order to sell an image, but 
then feels compelled to explain soci-
etal problems for his own artistic 
soul. This is one such album.

Tennis: 
Tritons advance to the 
second round 
Continued from page 24 

Steidl meyer said. "They actually 
had a match point against us. 
IMeyer! played really well; it was 
rcally neat to see." 

Albrecht and Schroeter had a 
bit of an easier time wi th their 
opponents, Nguyen Than and 
David ;\:guyen. The two Tritons 
took the lead after being tied 2-2 
dnd never rel inquished it in their 8-
5 win. 

The sweep by UCSD's doubles 
tcams was particularly key, as it 
required the Tritons to win only 
two of their singles matches to earn 
a victory. 

The Tritons ' NO.5 singles play-
n Blake Wilson-Hayden did his 
part, embarrassing Cal Poly's Feliz 
in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2 . 

"He played a great match, some 
of the best he's . played all year," 
Stcidlmeyer praised. 

The other men's si ngles victory 
was due to the racket of NO. 6 sin-
gles player Schroeter, who readily 
dispatched Bronco Kevin Chen, 
also in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. 

"Everett really picked up his 
game," Steidlmeyer said. "He beat 
someone he had lost to earlier in 
the year." 

The two victories by Everett 
and Wilson-Hayden rendered the 
other singles matches unneces-
sary, however both Wilson and 
Meyer had one-set leads over 
their opponents when the match 
was called . 

The win by the Tritons shows 
just exactly how far the team has 
come this season, as it had previ-
ously lost to Cal Poly on April 1, 4-
5, and then squeaked by the Bron-
cos just last week, 5-4. 

Steidlmeyer attributed this dif-
ference to a change in attitude by 
the team. 

"I think the difference was the 
intensity and the focus from the 
first point, and that is what we 
have to learn to get better at," he 
said . 

With thm victory on Tuesday, 
tht' Tritons will now advance to 
the second round of the West 
regional championship where 
they will go head-to-head against 
some stiff competition . The team 
will be leaving tomorrow to Laic,

said. 

- Eric Steldlmeyer 
Men 's tennis coach 

"But if we continue to play like 
we did against Cal Poly, I think we 
have an excellent chance." 

Steidl meyer was reluctant to 
make a prediction as to the poten-
tial of the team this year or next 
year. 

"Our goal for this year was to 
make NCAA playoffs in our first 
year in Division II. Then we said 
we would reasse'ss ou r goals, 
which is what we're doing right 
now," he said. "[Next yearl we 
expect most of our players to 
come back as better players. 
When each player gets a little bit 
better, then the entire team gets 
better." 

With this strong tennis team 
losing only one player, senior 
Cory Moderhak, to graduation, 
you can bet that when the UCSD 
men's tennis team does recon-
vene, its goals will include a lot 
more than just making the play-
offs. .

Track Shows Off 
at 'Cal/Nev 
Nielsen goes on a tear in 
the 5,000 meters ' 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field 
team headed south to the Califor-
nia/Nevada Track and Field 
Championships at UC Irvine last 
Sunday and it came back with 
so mething to boast about. 

It was all about UCSD 's star 
long distance runner james 
Nielsen 

Triton senior Nielsen grabbed 
his second championship at the 
event in the 5,000 meters. His 
time of 14:24 is also a new school 
record and an NCAA Division II 
national qualifying time. 

Track and field, made up of 
individuals, is a team, and UCSD 
had some other star athletes to 

- brag about , in add ition to 
ielÂ£en . 

jon Wong, a junior, took fifth 
place in the 1,500 meters and set a 
school record with a time of 
3:50.03. This too was an NCAA 
qualifying time. 

Rob Ewanio, also a junior, 
placed seventh in the shot put with 
an NCAA qualifying throw and a 
school record of 57 3-4. 

Not to be outdone, Triton 
sophomore Audrey Sung took fifth 
place in the 3,000 meters, an 
NCAA qualifying performance at 
10:09.54. 

For the women, junior Lynne 
Brinkman launched the javelin 
131-2 for a school record and an 
NCAA qualifying distam:e. 

The track and field team will 
next be heading back down south 
as they look forward to the Steve 
Scott Invitational at Irvine on Sun-
day at 9 a.m.

Women Pull out of Ojai 
Triton tennis gets ready for playoffs 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

It 's nitty-gritty time and the 
UCSD women's tennis team is 
pulling out all the stops in an 
attempt to duplicate in Division II 
the success it had for years in 
Division III. 

Each season, before the 
regional and national finals, the 
best players in each division go to 
Ojai, Calif., for individual tourna-
ments. The results in these tour-
naments determine the AlI -Amer-
ican team and also the individual 
national champions in singles and 
doubles. 

With many on the team con-
cerned with their injuries and 
academics, coach Liz LaPlante 
decided to skip Ojai this season 
and concentrate on the more 
important team accolades that 
follow. 

"We defaulted out of Ojai 
because of injuries and problems. 
with missing too much class," 
LaPlante said . 

The Tritons are the fo.urth-

"We defaulted out of 
Ojai because of injuries 
and problems with 
missing too much class. " 

- Uz laPlante 
Women 's tennis coach 

ranked team in the West region and 
boast being ranked 11 th in the 
country. They head to Hawaii on 
Friday, not for a relaxing vacation 
bathing on the beach, but to take 
on Hawaii Pacific in what effective-
ly is the first round of the national 
championsh ip tournament. 

"This is actually the first round 
of NCAA nationals, but lit's! 
played at a regional site," LaPlante 
said. "If we beat Hawaii Pacific, we 
would leave Tuesday for Pensaco-
la, Fla., for the 16-team national 
tournament." 

Hawaii Pacific is ranked higher 
than the Tritons by the smallest of 
margins: No. 3 in the West region 
and No. 10 in the nation. The only 
two teams ranked higher than 

Hawaii Pacific are UC Davis, which 
is ranked o. 2 in the region, and 
Brigham Young Univeristy-Hawaii, 
which is No.1 in the region and in 
the country. 

As far as injuries go, the Tri-
tons are beginning to beat the 
bug. With a little luck, they should 
be healthy in time to play in 
Hawaii. 

"Ashley IO'Neil! is now play-
ing and healthy," LaPlante sa id. 
"We're still waiting for Lyndsey 
Tadlock's arm to feel better. With 
Ithe! help of a cortisone shot, 
we'r,~ hoping she can play Satur-
day. 

The Tritons will need to have 
everyone at full strength to make 
it to Florida, and LaPlante knows 
her team is up for a challenge as 
immense as the one th at is cur-
rently before them. 

"Hawaii Pacific is a very strong 
team," LaPlante said. "Everyone 
will have to play strong to beat 
them ." 

Look for results from the

22 SPORTS 

Crew: 
Young team hurt due to 
bad seeding 
Continued from page 23 
race, narrowly losing to Humboldt 
State. 

The race was close until about 
1,300 meters, when Humboldt 
pulled away. 

Humboldt did not compete in 
the earlier lightweight four com-
petition, so its lightweight eight 
boat could be fresher. 

"That was their decision - to 
focus on one race," Pinkerton 
said. "I hoped we were strong 

Lounge: 
Mom and Dad again get 
in on the act 
Continued from page 23 
coked-up jackals rabidly gnawing 
their way through my fragile skull. 
Dehabilitated by one of the most 
excruciating, incapacitating hang-
overs I've ever experienced, I faced 
the day, realizing that there was 
only one feasible course of action 
avai lable, and it tormented my 
beleaguered dome to no end. 

Yes, a bottle of rum, the good 
stuff (Ralphs generic brand, not 
Albertson 's generic brand) and a 
large Coke from the deli (primari-
ly for the cup and the ice) and we 
were well back on our way to 
mt:l1tal solvency. With each swag 
of this vi le concoction, my murky 
thought process became a little 
more translucent, and soon I was 
almost able to walk. 

As soon as we were capable of 
walking, we headed to the beach, 
where swarms and swarms of daft 
sorority chicks and the frat guys 
that love tht:m had congregated to 
... urn, watch volleyball or some-
thlllg like that. Or maybe a few 
people were. Everyone I saw or 
spoke to had heard there was a 
volleyball tourney being played in 
the midst of the drun ken fracas 
bu t confessed no further knowl-

enough to do well. Humboldt has 
a good lightweight program." 

The second novice eight boat 
also earned some hardware, fin-
ishing third. 

The crew was comprised of 
coxswain Claire Romelfanger, 
BuffY Confalone, Amelyn Ho, Lisa 
Peerali, Tamar Carmona, jen Wat-
ters, Helen Chang, Nicole Corbett 
and Lila Mciver. 

For the icing on the cake, Gray 
was named to the WIRA All-Star 
Team. 

UCSD was not as successful in 
the varsity boats. 

"We have a young crew there 
and we had some bad luck," 
Pinkerton said . "Based on our 

edge of the subject, and went back 
to greedily imbibing the contents 
of his cup or bottle. 

Then there was a whole lot of 
glorious whooping and hollering 
and carryi ng on like plastered bas-
tards, which was buckets of fun -
except when, at one point, some 
kook dropped his drawers toÂ· take 
a picture with this girl and got all 
upset when we started pelting him 
with a mixture of potato salad and 
sand (it's even sicker than it 
sounds). 

When faced with a mix of San 
Diego dudes and thugafied LB 
locals, though, he slunk away in a 
huff, covered in potatoes and 
shame. More debauchery and acts 
of outright depravity on lhe beach 
followed , but these arc either too 
vulgar or too forgettable to 
enshrine in print. 

It was time to move on to the 
next chapter, the Burroughs fami -
ly home, where my dear mom and 
pop once again took in a large 
crew of sauced San Diegans. This Â· 
time, though, instead of the sole 
vodka offering, moms came 
through with a bottle of EI Capi-
tan and a jug 0' Skyy to soothe 
our parched throats. We took to 
the Jacuzzi with a vengea nce, 
passing the bottles around and 
throwing beers across the pool. 

This sort of thing often leads to 
troublesome and disturbing occur-
rences, and this time was no differ-

The UCSD Guardian 

time, we should have been in the 
finals. It was just unfortunate that 
we were badly seeded. I thought 
that we were a crew that had a 
medal chance." 

ext up for UCSD women's 
crew is the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, also at Lake 
Natoma, Calif. on May 12 at 8 
a.m. 

UCSD looks to be successful 
at the event because many of the 
bigger schools will be competing 
at the Pac10 Championships. 

The lritons will also be send-
ing a couple of varsity boats to the 
PaclO Championships to see how 
they rate. so it should be a busy 
weekend for UCSD crew. 

ent. Soon I was crouched, tiger-
style in the beautifully manicured 
pools ide planter, purging my belly 
of its pure liquor contents. Of 
course, once fin ish ed, I was faced 
with only the Morgan to cleanse 
my mouth. Thus it was done, and I 
was none the worse for wear. 

Poor Puma also felt the pain of 
war, opening a serious gash in his 
chin that, on more sober days, 
would warrant a visit to the hospi-
tal for sutures, but on this day a 
small towel and another draft were 
all that the doctor ordered. Soon 
after, the booze was gone and we 
were back to the pad for grub. 

It was about this time that a pal 
of mine, one A-Buck, approached 
my mother and queried her about 
the presence of any "lettuce" in 
the house. 

"No way: she replied, aghast at 
the notion, then adding, "Anyway, 
you're the guest - you should be 
the one supplying the lettuce." 

From that point on all is blurry 
at best, and lost to the ages at worst. 
I do recall ordering pint after pint 
from the first bar we patronized, 
pitcher after pitcher at the next and 
then being kicked out of the out-
side of another local LB bar for 
simply drinking a beer on the side-
walk. Then I woke up in a heap on 
the 1100r of Big B's crib with a 
drunken grin and a pile of crushed 
Coors Light cans next to my pillow. 

It was a long drive home.

Softball Downs 
San Bernardino 
Tritons takes a pair from the Coyotes to 
boost. their record to 31-14 and remain 
in the thick of the playoff hunt 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team is 
hankering for a post-season berth, 
and it helped its cause immensely 
this weekend. 

The Tritons swept a double-
header from California State San 
Bernardino on Saturday, winning 
2-1 and 5-1. 

In the first game, Amy Menee 
had two hits, scored a run and 
drove in a run . Angie Carr also had 
two hits and scored a run. 

Leea Harlan picked up the win 
with six strikeouts in seven innings. 

In the second game, tied at 1, 
the Tritons scored four runs in the 
eighth inning to pull out the victo-
ry. 

Mettee had three hits and 
scored two runs. Teammate jeanine 
Cordero drove in two and scored 
one and Erin Sinclair had two 
RBIs. 

Christi Martinelli struckout five 
in the extra-inning game. 

Also this weekend, in non-
league action, UCSD split a dou-
bleheader at home against Western 
New Mexico University. ' . 

In the first game, UCSD 

picked up tbe 3-2 victory after 
scoring a run in the bottom of the 
eighth. Samantha Hayes had two 
RBIs and HarlanÂ· pIcked up the 
victory. 

The second game was a little 
different, as the Mustangs shut out 
the Tritons, 3-0. 

"They were a decent team: said 
Triton head coach Patti Gerckens. 
"I think we probably should have 
won both games." 

UCSD is now 31-14 overall and 
19-9 in California Collegiate Con-
ference play. 

The Tritons remain in a fierce 
battle for the CCAA title against 
Cal State Bakersfield, UC Davis 
and Cal State Stanislaus. 

"We need to take it one game 
at a time: Gerckens said. "If we 
do the things we 've done all year, 
we' ll get . the outcome that we 
want." 

The final gal11.es of the season 
are this weekend. UCSD hosts 
CSU Dominguez Hills on Friday at 
1 :30 p.m. and then they have a 
showdown with CSU Bakersfield 
on Saturday at noon . 

"We need to play to win," Gerk-
cens said. "We will be up for the 
challenge."

The UCSD cycling team 
wrapped up its season last week 
at the Western Collegiate Cycling 
Conference Championships. 
Held at Palmdale, Calif. and lan-
caster, Calif. and hosted by Cal 
Poly Pomona, the event featured 
many of the best cyclists from all 
over California. 

ucsI1's Pete Knudsen went 
out with a bang. 

Knudsen tore up his competi-
tion, finishing first overall in the 
conference. On the first day of the 
event, he grabbed fll'St in the 88-
mile road race, embarrassing 
many of the best riders out West. 

The second day of the event, 
Knudsen was I)ot finished. He 
dominated the competition in the 
60-lap criterium. 

Knudsen now owns the over-
all season title and will be taking 
part in nationals later this month . 

Knudsen has now been 
upgraded to Category 1, the high-
est amateur category in cycling. 

Though it was the KnudSen

already ragged, decrepit livers. The 
first order of business once we hit 
town and before the sun went down 
was to head out to the local corner 
store and purchase a couple of foat 
doggs. 

As an inhabitant of the LBC, I 
was morally and contractually 
obligated to drink a St. Ides 40, 
while Satchel, being a orCal, 
opted for the aIde English. The 
Crooked Letta, you see, is more of 
a heady, tangy brew and is available 
at all reputable LB stores, while the 
eight-ball has a more refreshing, 
mild, almost piney taste that 
appeals to a wider array of palates. 

Anyway, those were gone as fast 
as they were acquired, and it was off 
to do the drunken bar tour of the 
greater Long Beach area. We started 
off at joe jost's, a traditional local 
haunt, where we sipped on ice-cold 
schooners of Pabst Blue Ribbon, 
grubbed on joe's specials with pick-
led egg~ and shot a round of pool. 

Or at least I think that's what 
we did. Through hazy recollections 

. and gathered sources it has 
become vaguely understood that 
the bar tour ended a scant two 
stops later, two stops which were 
directly next door to each other, 
with the final stop visited only after 
we had been kicked out of the one 
prior for reckless drunkery and 
boisterous behavior. 

Let it be said, however, that 
Limerick's, the bar from which our 
exit was hastened, served but beer, 
while Crow's, the haunt into which 
we crawled, served mostly cock-
tails - stiff cocktails, which I 
thought to be fortuitous at the 
time. The next morning though, I 
woke up covered in hundreds of 
dollars' worth of bar tabs, scribbled 
on with what looked to be the rav-
ings of a frenzied derelict, but on 
further inspection turned out to be 
my signatures. 

Ouch, and my head hurt even 
worse. Maybe it had something to 
do with the tumble I took into the 
bathtub the night before, taking 
the shower curtain down with me. 
My dear friends, upset and sympa-
thetic at my plight, proceeded to 
laugh, point and snap pictures of 
me as I flopped around, trying to 
ove'rcome my drunken discom-
bobulation and exit the tub. 

I awoke with what felt like wild,

ber of other bright spots. 

In the road race category, Matt

division, and Mark Chaisson 
placed 15th in Men's B. 

On the women's side, Ester

for nationals. Also, Sabrina Mor-

The UCSD badminton team 
had a number of impressive vic-
tories 'lit the NCAA Badminton 
National Tournament in 
Philadelphia this weekend. 

The wins were even more 
impressive conSidering this is the 
team's first year in existence and 
it competed against the top teams 
in the nation. 

The event featured some of 
the toughest competition from 
around the country. 

DeDe Davis and Dora Walsh 
teamed up to take second in the 
women 's doubles category. 

Walsh was not through, as she 
also picked up second place in 
the women's singles category. 

The efforts of Walsh, Davis 
and others landed UGSD the 
overall team title. 

Not to be outdone, the men 
also had something to cheer 
about. Julian Wu and Berny Yu 
united to finish second in the 
overall men's category.

The win was especially sweet, as

W hat's the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the phrases "sorority

tence? 

Well. of course, there's "that," but 
there's also the festive, annual 
booze-drenched event known as the 
ln tersorority Volleyba ll Tournament, 
or ISVT (pronounced "iss-vet") for 
short, where women go up against 
their Greek counterparts from other 
colleges in fierce, grueling, blood-
curdl ing volleyball action that leaves 
many a "sister" crying in her Zima.

2000. ISVT 2001 was very much 
like ISVT 2000, meaning that it 
included bottles and bottles of pre-
mium, high-octane booze and 
occurred in the springtime. Let us 
reflect, through a muddled lens, on 
this sauced-up spectacle.

Tennis Passes Playoff Test 
Tritons men sweep Cal Poly 5-0 in West Regional 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Last Tuesday at UCSD's 
Northview tennis courts, the Tri-
ton tennis team clashed with the 
Cal Poly Pomona Broncos in the 
first round of the NCAA Division 
II men's West Regional Tennis 
Championship. 

Playing under a threatening, 
gray sky for most of the match , the 
weather was not enough to cool 
off the red-hot Tritons, as they 
absolutely embarrassed the 12-10 
Cal Poly by winning 5-0. 

It was clear from the get-go 
that the Tritons had come to win, 
as they sported the all american 
red, white and blue warm ups and 
drowned out the Broncos' pre- . 
game cheer with their own rau-
cous yells. 

Head coach Eric Steidlmeyer 
was understandably enthusiastic 
about his team's performance. 

David Pilz/ Guard/WI 
Bopp: UCSD's Sameer Chopra teamed with Michael Mtryer UJ win their No.2 doubles match 9-8 (8-6) over Cal Poly Pamana at 
home on Tuesday. 

"To be honest, it was really a 
good performance by us," he said . 
"We not only played good tennis, 
but on a big occasion, which was 
neat to see." 

The Triton doubles teams, 
consis ting of pairs Jeff Wilson 
and Cory Moderhak , Sameer 
Chopra and Michael Meyer, and 

Dan Albrecht and Everett 
Schroeter came up especially big 
for UCSD, selling the tone by 
winning all three doubles match-
es. 

Wilson and Moderhak beat Cal 
Poly's J.R. Villaroman and A.J. 
Feliz 8-6. coming back from a 5-4 
deficit by outrallying the Bronco 

duo and forcing the opponents to 
make errors. 

The No. 2 doubles match fea-
tured a marathon match between 
UCSD's Chopra and Meyer 
against the Broncos' Ryan Terry 
and Cassio Giomelli. The teams 
traded leads throughout the 
match, until the end when they

UCSD women's crew took the 
gloves off and smacked around the 
competition at the Western Inter-
collegiate Rowing Championships 
last weekend. 

The Tritons grabbed two pen-
nants at the event, which was held 
at Lake Natoma. 

Four of the nine boats that 
entered the event left with medals, 
and there were also two fourth-
place finishes. 

The first pennant came in the 
""l ightweight four. The boat was 

made up of Jaime Cooper, Emily 
Gray, Cari B1emker, Julie Snyder 
and coxswain Liz Edmunson. 

Boat captain Heather Beckman 
was unable to row because of an 
illness. Cooper tooUer place and 
led the 1ritons to lightweight gold. 

"[Beckman) was ill the week 
before," said Patti Pinkerton, 
UCSD women's crew head coach. 
"It cut into her training: 

With Cooper in the boat, 
though, UCSD had no worries. 

"She has really come on," 
Pinkerton said. "This is the first 
year that she has rowed light-
weight. She gets such a great 
rhythm: 

The other top spot came at the 
hands of the novice four boat.
