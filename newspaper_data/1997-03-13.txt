Connerly Proposes 
Mystery Admissions 
BERKELEY, ali 1'. -
Regent Ward onnerly wants 
to remove the name~ from 
application~ hefore they arc 
processed to hide all clues to an 
applicant's race. Connerl , who 
pushed ahead the university 's 
repeal of affi rmati ve action two 
years ago. claims that campus 

admission~ offices will use any 
method to promote diversity -
induding deriving a person's 
race from thei r name. UC 
Berkeley's admissions director 
said it is almost impo sible to 
create a completely anonymous 
admissions system. and that 
people will make as umptions 
- correct or not. Other regents 
derided onnerly' proposal 
and said people should be enti -
tiled to thei r names.

UPDATE: Modified code 
spells out students' rights and 
re~ponsibi l ities 
By Adam Nichols 
Staff Writer 

Following three years of intense discu sion, 
U SO's Student onduct ode has been 
revi ed to spell out in more exact detai l both 
student ' rights and penalti es for misconduct. yp STAGNANT BUDGETS 

AND SPIRALLING 
COSTS ARE FORCING 
THE UCSD LIBRARIES 

TO TAKE A LONG, 
HARD LOOK AT 

The new code. which is pending approval 
by Chancellor Robert Dynes, was developed by 
the tudent Regulations Review Committee.

See LIBRARY, Page 3 

ick Aguilar, director of SO s tudent 
Policies and Jud icial Affairs Office and chair-
person of the committee, was the driving forcc 
behind the revisions. 

One of the mmt significant c hange~ 
II1vlllves the univer~tty 's usc of mandatory stu-
dent fees for re ligious ends. In the past. stu-
dents have compla ll1cd that their fee~ were u~ed 
to furt her ~uch cau~es through guest lecture~ 
and other activi ties. 

"S tudent fees may not be used for rcligiou~ 
lorl ideo logical purposes," Aguilar said. "Each 
lUdent has the right not to have I theirlmanda-

tory sludenl fees used for rclig iou~ purposes." 
Although Aguilar sa id sl udenls are entitled 

to a refund of Ihe portion of their fees used for 
such purposes, refunds arc prorated and some-
tllnes amount to little more than 0.25. 

The new code specilies thi s ri ght. 
Other changes have Ocen made to the way 

the uni versity handles allegati ons of student 
misconduct. Previously, student s' ri ghts were 
not clearl y spelled out in the code. Under the 
pending revisions, each stage of the discipli -
nary process is outlined to ensure fair and eq ui -
tahle treatment. 

"Students have the right to the due process 
provisions in the tudent Conduct Code," 
Ag uilar said. 

The new code will ignificantl y affect stu -
dents li ving in university housing. 

Although the revisions will standardize di s-
ci plinary proceedings across all fi ve colleges, 
resident deans will no longer have the di sc re-
tion they current ly enjoy in dealing with viola-
tions.

he supports the concepl of Internet 
puhlishing, hc and hi graduate stu -
dents have had problems hecause 
of the libraries' overly ambitious 
and " hcavy-handert" journal can -
cellation policies. 

"Sometime I have to wait 
weeks for a journal article," Wills 
said. " I won't, however, be the one 
hardest hit. The grad students will 
encounter the most trouble." 

Wills added that he views the 
discontinuation of certain journals 
as a ri sk to the libraries' futurc 
research capabilities. 

''This is another action that 's 
Ictting the library go to hcck," 
Will said. " It will be almost 
impossible to nurse it back 
Ibecausel discontinuations put gaps 
in the library's co llection . I f the

Move to Division II Will 
Increase Spirit and Prestige 

One of the most inleresti ng items on next quarter's A.S . 
election ballot is a non-binding referendum on whether 
U SO should upgrade its athletic programs from NCAA 
Di vision II I to Di vi).ion 1/ without !»cholar).hips. The 
pro~pec t of moving up one divi~ion ha~ cau!»ed much 
debate, becau~e the wide!»pread perception i~ that focu,ing 
more on athl etic program!» by moving up a divl).ion woul d 
dimini:-.h UCSO\ reputati on a). a top academic in,titution. 

The idea that upgrading CSD's l:xccl lent Divi:-'Ion III 
program~ to Di ision II would bring down our kvcl or aca-
demic achievement is dubious at be~t and ludicrouc., at 
worst. Divi~ion I ,chool:-. :-.uch ", LA and C Berkeley 
have oUNanding spom programs and arc the most highl y 
regarded campuses in the system. It is fa ll aciou, to 
assume that a trade-orr ex ists hetween the qual ity of acade-
mic programs and the quality of sports progralm. 

In fact, moving to Division II - thereby increasing the 
compctiti veness and visibi I ity of l1CSO\ ,ports programs 
- offers several benefits to SD. First. it will add 
tremendously to our languid school spirit. Having hi gher-
quali ty sports teams to cheer on cannot help but bring the 
campus together. 

Second, bringing the campu~ together and increasing 
school spiri t would go a long way toward improving our 
alumni base. ompared to other schools, CSD's alumni -
association participation and contribution rate~ are simply 
pathetic. Having quality sports teams for alumni to rally 
around would inspire alumni loyalty and translate in lO 
increased contributions. 

UCSD students should voll.: "yes" on the proposed di vi-
sion move. Moreover, a move to Division II should be 
accompanied by athll.!tic scholarships so as to attract as 
many high-quality athletes as possible. Onl y when UCSO 
starts to thi nk seriously about improving its intercollegiate 
athletic programs will it begin to climb out of the shadow 
ur Division I schools like U LA and Berkeley. 

Sensible Fee Policy Should 
Protect FaI.lilies and 1116 UC 

For public universities . maintaining a hi gh-quality 
academi c environmen t whi le simu ltaneously keeping 
education affordab le has proven to be a dirficult feat. 
In the earl y 1990s, Ca lifornia's higher-education sys-
tem raised student fees by 135 percent. which many 
people believe limited access to t!1e universitit:!'I. 

Aiming to rectify this situation , California 
Assemblywoman Denise Moreno Oucheny (0- an 
Diego) has introduced the oll ege Affordability Act or 
1997, which would freeze student fecs in the S 
and community-co ll ege s stems until the yea r 2000. 

ftcr 2000. fee s would again be allowed to rise , hut 
would be pl:gged to the average rate of gro\\ th in pcr-
\onal incollles within Californid . 

Crcat ing a plan that makes fce incrca,es more rre 
dictahk is a gn.:a t idea. Parent'> trying budgd for col -
lege tUition ha ve had no way to predict how much fees 
wou ld rise from yt:ar to year . . omct imes fees were sta-
ble. other ti mes they skyrocketed . Tying fees to a rela-
tively stable benchmark a ll ows paren ts much more 
peace of mind when doing financial planning. 

However, tying fcc increases to rises in the level of 
per capita income is not the best policy. Instead . we 
believe the fee increases shou ld be li nked to a reliable 
measure of the inflation rate. This wou ld ensure the 
va lue of fee monies to the universi ty in times of high 
inflation. and avoid increasing students' relative share 
of university expendi tures in ti mes of low inflation .

The UCSD Guardian 

There Is a 
frighteningly 
Influential body of 
activists hell-bent 
on pursuing their 
pathological vision 
of a utopian world 
where nobody's 
feelings ever get 
hurt - no matter 
whose rights get 
trampled In the 
process. 

words do have power - to heal . 
encou rage. i nspl re, educate and 
enlighten . Likewise, words also 
ca rry the power to break hearts, 
spread lies and command arm ies. 

However. at the end of the day, 
words have no more power over 
your we ll -bei ng than what you 
allow them. As Eleanor Roosevelt 
once o bserved. " obody can 
make you feel inferi or without 
your permission ." Put differently, 
the question can be asked, " How 

much power over you r emoti onal 
sec urity do you want to give to 
people'!" 

So how can we move forward ? 
Perhaps a good first step is to 
reconnect with your sense of 
humor. People with a keenl y 
developed . ense of humor know 
when to laugh - and as a corol-
lary. know when not to laugh. 

People need to learn to pick 
their bailie!>. A sense of humor 
offers one the desperately needed 
perspecti ve to do ,0. Don 't squan-
der your pa!>,ion on the inconse-
quenti al. The perennially so lemn 
aco lytes of politica l correctness 
never lea rned thi s lesson. 
Consequently. they find them-
se lves fi ghting the wrong fires. We 
would do well nOI to repeat their 
mistakes in our individual li ves . 

I've been working at the 
Guardian for close to three years 
now, writing libertarian polemics 
and defending race-neutral poli-
cics, frec markels, Christians and 
ot her unpopular targets of the aca-
demic left. During Ihi s time. I' ve 
been called a raci I. a Klansman, a 
neo- azi . a se ll -out white-
wannabe. 10 pounds of @#$% in 
a five -pound bag - and th at ' just

Scriously, without an apprecia-

tion of the absurd, it would be dif-
ficult to weather criticism wilh 
grace and good humor. The mcs-
sage bears repeating: Words only 
have as much power over you as 
you allow. 

So Ihe nex t time you find your-
self angry over a commentary you 
hear or read (like, you know, a 
Peter Chang column ) resist the 
lemptation to fi Ie a lawsuil , call in 
a death Ihreat or hurl a homh 
through the poor sap's offi ce. 
Realilc thai the wurld of ideas is a 
noisy and chaotic place - live in 
it long enough and you're bound 
to ge t jostled once in a while . 
That's pan of Ihe price we pay for 
living in a free ociety. Wear a 
fl ak jacket if you must. 

More imporlantly, lea rn to 
keep your coo l. We need 10 learn 
to laugh at ou rsel ves, and at our 
all -too-human affectations. If you 
find yourse lf floored on the mat of 
verbal juji tsu, don't cry for some-
one to censor yo ur opponent. Pick 
you rself off the grou nd. select 
your weapon from the dusty 
armory of your brain and return 
fire.

COMMENTARY: In tead of dividing society by empha. izing the differences among our ra ial backgrounds, 
we should seek to celebrate American history, culture and traditions a means of bringing us together 

RACE-SPECIFIC HISTORIES DIVIDE AMERICA 
By Chris Schreiber 
EdItor in Chief 

Once again Fehruary has come 
and gone. With its departure we 
wi tnessed the passing of another 
African-American History Month. 
For 28 days, we were treated to cel-
ehrations of various Americans of 
Afri can ancestry who achi eved 
great things, made amal.ing discov-
eries or demonstrated tremenduu, 
va lor in Ihe Iield of bailie. 

The theory behind Afri ca n-
American History Month is that it 
gives African-Americans a chance 
to celebra te their cu lture and 
achievemenls. However, the prob-
lem with selling as ide a month in 
which to focus on African-
American hi story is that it supports 
the mindsetthat African-Americans 
arc excluded from the mainstream 
of American hi story and culture for 
the remaining II months of the 
year. 

The focu~ should not be on 
African-American hi story as a sep-
arate body of study for a separale 
people. Instead, Americans should 
focus on their comm n interests, 
goals, va lues and hi story. which 
work together to create the basis for 
the American society. 

Americans cherish per onal 
freedom, and understand that such 
freedom goe hand-in-hand with 
personal responsibility. American 
society is couched in the premi se 
that everyone is equal before the 
law, regardless of race, creed or 
color. People in olher countries 
know that Ameriea is the land of 
opportunity. where anyone can suc-
ceed wilh hard work and persever-
ance. The plethora of opportunity

and the promise of freedom are wh) 
millions of people come to live here 
every yea r. ooth legally and il legal-
ly. 

We should quit trying to artifi -
cia lly link people's identilies and 

se lf-e~ teems wi th so-ca lled "home-
land," that they will likely never 
sec. Even If people were given the 
opportunity to visi t these home-
land" they would most likely not 
find whal they discovered therein 
terrihly edifymg to their distraught 
~fJiri t , . 

As a case in point. take Keith 
Richhurg. the former Afri can 
bureau chief for the Wa.s"i'I~101i 
Post. Ri chhurg. who de,cribcd hi m-
se lf as an African-American prior to 
hi.. three-year stint in Africa, 
viewed the horror~ of that cont inent 
lIfJ close and in graphic color. 

Devastating illne ses, such as 
Ebola, sleeping sickness and AIDS 
(almost 60 percent of the world 's 
AIDS cases are in Africa), ravage 
the population. Strong-arm dicta -
tors li ve in splendor, plundering the 
economic of various nation-states 
as millions starve. Of course, perva-
sive racism also exists. Ancienttrib-
al conflicts are the bases of the raee 
wars that rage within the borders of 
several African nations. 

So affected by his African expe-
rience, Richburg wrote a book 
detailing his time there. TItled 0111 
of AIIlI'rica: A Black Man Confronls 
Africa, it is a mu t,read for anyone 
inclined toward longing for the land 
of his ancestors. Richburg graphi -
cally describes the misery and bru -
tality pervasive th roughout the 
African continent. (WARNING :

hate is the senseless hrutalit y. the 

wa~ t c of human life. I hate the 
unfairnes,. Ihe injusti ce, the way 
repressive systems strip decent 
people of their dignity." In short , 
Ri chburg is glad to live in a free 
country like America. governed by 
a rule of law that guarantees per-
sonal liberties and freedoms to all 
its ci li7ens, 

America has always heen a land 
of immigrants, people who hrought 
over new talents, ~ ki lis and perspec-
ti ve, and integra ted thcmsclve, into 
mainstream American culture. 
Contrary to the opinions of those 
pushing for a Balkanization of our 
socicty into groups comprised sole-
ly of homogeneous hyphenated-
American factions. American hi sto-
ry is notlhe exclusive possession of 
white mafes. 

When studying American hi sto-
ry. the firs t-generat ion American of 

Korean descent who was ,wom III 
a, a citi/en just la,t yea r. thc sev-
cnth-generati on American of Zulu 
descent whosc ancestors were 
slaves and the Ihird -generation 
American of Polish descent whose 
ancestors came staleslde Ileei ng the 

at.1 hlillkrieg should all take the 
same amount of pride in the accolll -
plishmcnts of Washington, 
Jefferson, Lincoln and Franklin as 
any person whose ancestors sa iled 
over on the Mayflower. 

Con erscly. the achievements of 
George Washington Carve r, the 
Tuskegee Airmen. Colin Powell 
and Miles DaVIS shou ld Oc celehrat-
cd hy all American~ , not as the spe-
cia l ac hievements of African-
Americans. hut <I S the achievements 
of an ex traordinary group of 
Amerit:<lns, 

Many generations of immigrants 
ha ve created their American suc-
cess stories hy hringi ng the best 
ideas and praclices from their 
respecti ve homelands and integrat-
ing those things with the skills nec-
essary to succeed in America. Also 
important is that American society 
is free and upen enough to allow for 
the assimi lation of so many differ-
ent people and ideas. while main -
taining the character that made the 
United Slates a great count ry in the 
fi rst place. 

The month of February, like the 
other II months of the year, was a 
great month to Oc an American. We 
shou ld all take pride in the fact that 
Keith Richburg is an American, just 
as we should take pride in the 
accomp li shments of all great 
Americans. Everyday is a great day 
to be an American.

Gainesville, Florida's Less Than Jake is 
IIUp-to-Par" and Ready to Please Their Fans 

...... ake three chords, fast tempos, 
horns, wi lly lyrics rueled by a 
hcalthy dose of Pel. and an 

infatuation wi th "The Dukes of 
Hal.l.ard." and you have all the 

clements that make up Less 
Than Jake, a ska/punk band bailing 
from Gainesville. Fla. 

The hnnd showcases it ~ hlcnd of 
raSt. poppy, punk guitars and ska -
tinged horns on its major label debut. 
Losing Streak , on Capitol Records. 
The hand has quickly gained a loyal 
fo llowing based on its inees ant tour-
ing and its do-it-your elf work cthic. 

"LTJ," as the band is known by 
Gainesville locals. was founded in 
1992 by lead singer/guitarist Chris, 
drummer Vinnie and saxophonist Jes-
sica. As they prefer a first-name-basis • 
only, add last names at your leisure. 

The band's name come from a 
piece of retro-American lang, mean-
ing "not up to par." Less Than Jake's 
indie label debut. Pezcore, released on 
Dill Records, SOld 8,000 copies in its 
first four months. The band was also 

named Band of the Year by Moon 
Magazine. Gainesville's monthly alter-
native-music llIugal.ine. 

Less Than Jake will play March 21 
al Soma with Mr. T Experience and 
MxPx. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian . drummer Vinnie 
talked about the band, touring 
antI what people will do for 
free stuff. 
Guardian: How did the 
band come together? 

Vinnie: Well, Chris and J 
started a hand under a differ-
ent name. called Good Grief. abou t 
four years ago. Then he moved up to 
college and we broke the hand up. Our 
bass player at the time went and trav-
eled with the camiva l. Then I rollowed 
Chris up to Gainesville, wbere we 
started Less Than Jake. We got anoth-
er bass player, added Jessica, uur sax-
ophone player, Buddy, our trombone 
player and about a year and a balf ago 
added Derron, our baritone sax player. 
Have you played ska since the 

band's inception, or did that 
come about later? 

We start ed alit as a pop-punk band 
with hOnls. and the ska elcment fol -
lowed it because we had horns. It was 

prelly much an undecided 
route. I think that 's a good 
thing. because our sound kind 
of grav itated towards ska -
not like a lot of bands out 
there that go for ska by say-
ing, "We're going to be a ska 
band. " Itbink that we had the 
good lu(;k to be ab le to form 
our sound on our own, rather 

than have any preconceived notions. 
Onee we started doing ska/punk . there 
were really only three or four bands 
that were doing it. 
Why do you have so many 
relea .. s on so many different 
.. bela? 

We've always made a policy to do 
things with friend., and that's where 
most of our singles came from - JUSt 
guys who were our friends . Then it

Psychic Karaoke 

MCA 

-*.* 

The innovati ve digital dance 
sounds engineered by Transg lohal 
Underground (TGU) bring togeth -
er the changing face of culture, 
the music of traditional hip-hop 

heat~ and Middle Eastern inspira-
tions on its fourth full -length 
release, Psychic Karaoke. TGU 
has grahbed the allention of popu-
lar culture with its unmatched 
ability to succe~sfully cross cul -
tural rhythms and world sounds 
through dance music . 

TGU produces trance-inducing 
sounds that combine with an 
instrumental verve. With Psychic 
Karaoke , the three transcend E'lst-
ern and Western ideals, incorpo-
rating the 'elec tronic sounds from 
various cultures into their album. 

This recording will carry any 
audience away to a deep, sensory-
entrenched place. However, the 
tribal drum heats, alol1g with the 
penetrating hass, force the listener 
to wake up and dance. 

When the capacity of it~ cultur-
al-dance hyhrid is rccognll.cd, Ihe 
cult i ng-cdge performance by 
Transglohal Underground on Psy-
chic Karallke is sure to garner 

prai~e acros~ the Mates, as it has 111

i\ fter an II -year struggle to the

a strong foundation wilh It latest 
album, Whiplash. Well worth the 
wait, James maintains it~ , ignature 
ound on thi ~ alhum while ,egue-

ing into di fferent musica l genre,. 
The voice of lead voca ii sl Tim 
Booth sti II resonates over the 
album 's clallering industrial diseo 
and powerful electne-guitar riffs. 

Whipilish is a mesh of Laid, the 
band's previous album, and Wah -
Wah, an experimental album the 
band produced with Brian Eno. 
Eno' innuence is prevalent through-
out the album, and is most apparent 
in the song "Play Dead." 

TIle final song on the album, 
"Blue Pasters," encompasses all 
the genres of the band 's sound. It 
includes everything from B(x)th 's 
eccentric Iyncs to the underlYing 
hum or the electric guitar to Jim 
Glennie 's gentle has, . 

James is one of the few hand, to 
make it past the Manche,ter ,cene til 
a dll'J'erent level or con tinUity The 
con~ l ~ten 'y and careful expenmcn-
tation that origi nate in the hand\

Tipsy 
Trip Tease 

Alpllod,1 

-* ••• 

On its irre~istible debut , Trip 
Tellse, Tipsy weaves its listeners 
through a trippy, intrica te palctte of 
loun ge and ambiance, interspersed 
with Lany c ut~ and samples. 

Ca rtoonish at tifl1e~, and always 
animated, Tipsy - the brainchild 
of Sound Traffic Control mcmbers 
Tim Digulla and DaVid Gardner -
brandishe, i t ~ humor through 
wacky sa mpling , which are 
descripti vely reduced to "bleeps" 
or "boinks." 

Infused with organs, guitars, the 
sound of cocktail being poured, 
funky rhythms, tinkling noises and 
too many other such niceties to 
mention, Trip Tellse shimmers with 
genius. Be warned: listeners will 
lind them elves lost in ab tract, 
unrea hable dimensions that tran-
scend both time tlnd space - par-
ti cularly on tra ks like the album's 
opener, "Mr. Excitemenl." 

Trip Tease is impossible to cate-
gOrJ/e, and cven more difficult to 
escape. Its cut-up, tweaked e)(uber-
ancc will surely thrill patrons of 
,ophisti ca ted loun ge and infantile 
humor.

How smooth do the tours 
run with so many people 
in the band? 

Sometimes it gets hecti c, but 
on the whole, we do OK. Our 
anity stays intact. Sometimes it 
get~ (;ral.Y because wc LOur in a 
small van, and there's seven of 
us that go out. Sometimes things 
get hecti c, and sometimes we 
ge t on each other's nerves. For 
the most part , it 's all righl. We 
love what we ' re doing and that 
makes it bearable_ 
How did the whole 
"trainspanking" mania 
happen? 

I don 't even know how that 
started. It 's just somcthing that 
wc' ve been doing, and it 's start-
ed to get really crazy and out of 
control. Kids are just going, 
"Bring me up and trai nspl nk 
me," and we ' re ju t goi ng, 
"Whoa, we have to stop." Wc 
SlO pped dOing it ror a whi Ie, ju~t 
because the legal aspects could 
prove to be hazardous. 

What we do now is have 
people rrom the audience corne 
up and spank each other for free 
~turf, so that way we ' re prelly 
much free and clear on the legal 
~ jde of things. For a while, it 
was pretty maniacal. When 
we'd be trainspanking someone 
in Chicago at the Metro in front 
of 1,200 people. It got kind of 
cral.y. It was fun, noncthele s. 
You started a record 
label, Fueled By Ramen. 
What's going on with 
that? 

That 's a big deal - that's 
going to help our label out a 101.

What's the best thing about 
being in Less Than Jake? 

The people that bring you Pel, 
Ihat 's the best thing. The tra ve l is 
cool. too. But thc peoplc that come 
to see us ... That's the best thing 
because people arc like, -'Come 
stay at my house," or " orne hang 
out ,'- and that 's awcsome_ Pcople 
will come and say -'Here's Pel dis-
pensers," or "Here's candy," or " I 
love your band, I' ve listened to you 
forever and I'm stoked th at you' re 
herc." You can't beat thaI. 
What's with the love of Pez? 

Pez is just, I don ' I know ... some 
people grab onto difrcrent Icons 
from thcir childhood, and Pel hap-
pens to he OIlC that ~tuck wllh me. 
So haslcally I have the mac-daddy 
co llec tion of Pcz di,pen~ers and 
stuff. 
What are your musical influ-
ences? 

I'd say Bow-Wow-Wow, the B-
52's, the Clash, Madness, .he 
Ramones, Kiss; then the whole 
slcw of glam-rock bands that I 
loved, Slayer, Venom and Exodus, 
stuff like thaI. It runs the gamut 
from the really cheesy to the rea lly 
fas t and cheesy. I'vc been a fan of' 
lots of music over the years, I still 
am. I lo ve grindcore, and a bunch 
of other stuff as well . like HO's pop, 
and pop-punk , and hard-core stulT. 
Are the songs autobiograph-
ical, or are they fiction? 

They're all autobi ographical. 
They ' re all experiences from my 
past. It 's reall y wei rd to tal k about 
them and have someone else sing 
them, but it's just an ou tlet , and I 
li ke doing it. That 's one of the 
things that's odd about Less 11lan 
Jake, how the lyrics come about and 
how someone else si ngs them. But 
it works out that way, and it's cool. 
What kind of bands do you 
like to play with the most? 

Pop-punk bands, we love pop-
punk. I like playing with ka bands 
and Roger like playing with faster 
bands. But as a whole, we love the 
pop-punk. Three chords and a 
melody line and we're seL Look at 
our show in San Di ego with Mr. T 
Experience and MxPx. Us three 
bands are going to be pop-punk 
hclL At the Nile Theater lin 
Phoenixl , we' re playing with 
Squirtgun and Evcrready, and that's 
going to be another pop-punk 
ni ght. I love 11. Everyhody seems to 
be in a beller mood at a pop-punk 
show.

the Tritons to take the early lead. 

Both UCS D's No. 5 Ping Yeh and hi s 
teammate in the rourth spot, Dave Murphy 
lost in two se ts, i ncreasi ng the Eag les ad -
vantage, 3-0. The Emory squad would only 
need one more game to seal the victory. The 
Tritons, not about to give up, won the ir last 
rour si ngles game to teal the match. 

On Monday, UCSD accumulated its sec-
ond 6-1 defeat or Rochester in two years, as 
the Tritons won the doubles point and only 
gave up two out of nine possi ble mat ches. 

Singles victories came easy to the Tri-
tons against the team from New York . No.

Continued from page 20 
runs in the middle inning~ , but it didn ' t mat -
ter. Theo Robins pitched a sp lendid game, 
throwing five innings or shutout baseball. 
Mark Mason led the Triton hitting onslaught 
with four RB is. Chris Rondestvedt had three 
hit s and three RBis, while Kennith Fluharty 
and Tony Lin had three hits each. 

That game was a great boost for the Tri-
tons, who had not scored much in their previ-
ous five games. That kind of an exp losion was 
exactly what they nceded to raise their confi -
dence ror the meeting with NAIA rival , Poi nt 
Lorna. 

Michael Bedar would he on the hill for 
Fletcher, and he would need a performance 
similarto hi s eight and one-third gem in order 
ror the Tritons to keep their winning treak 
ali ve.

"I just played my ga me," Murphy sa id. 
" I played with a dirrerent racket than I was

crushed my serves and beat the guy in tWO

and Saturday against Redlands and Calvin

He didn 't shut out the Crusaders, but he 
didn ' t need to. The Trit on batsmen were once 
again on tOP ortheir game, especially Ma on. 
In the top or the first, he crushed a two-run 
homer, after which the Tritons wou ld never 
losc the lead. 

They sure came close when Bedar gave up 
a two- run homerin the six th tha t cut the Triton 
lead to 6-4 . The Tritons wou ld not col lapse, 
they wanted thi s win . They pUI twO more runs 
on the boa rd , going into the bouom of the 
ninth with an 8-6 lead. 

The Crusaders, however, wou ld not go 
away. They put together a rally, scoring a run 
on reliever Eddie Ishak. The newest member 
or the Triton bullpen scttled down and got the 
save. 

That 's three in a row ror the Tritons, who 
will return home rortwo more games laterthi s

JECKYL AND HYDE: Hosting Division J UC Irvine at RIMAC Arena last Tuesday night brought out inconsistent and erratic 
play from the Triton netminders, as they dropped the match to the Anteaters in three straight sets, 15-4, 17-16 and 15-9 
By Steve Walsh 
Co·Associate Sports Editor 

Tuesday night ' vo lleyba ll 
match at RIMAC Arena wa a story 
of two very distinct teams. 0, not 

UC Irvin e a nd 
UCSD but rather the 
two entirely differ-
ent squad that the 
Tritons sent onto the 
court. In a trange 
athleli c Dr. Jeky ll 
and Mr. Hyde 

_ .... iiiiiiI_ scenerio, UCS D had 
its team metamorphose from hor-
rifying to normal and return (a 
horrifyi ng all in the matter of a' 
three-game match. 

Playi ng without juni or middl e 
blocker Guy Mount , who was hos-
pitalized for a short period foll ow-
ing a fainting spe ll during a match 
agai nst San Diego State last weck, 
the Tritons found th em selve~ in 
the middle of a science-fiction 
thriller as they hosted the Division 
I Anteaters. 

UCSD opened the match doi ng 
its best Mr. Hyde impersonation. 
as the team resembl ed a squad th at 
was pl ay ing its first match to-
gether. The Tritons opened game 
one with a bang as sophomore 

middle blocker Devon Jeffcoat, in 
for Mount , slammed horne a UCI 
overpa s for a point. Butthat would 
be the only time UCSD would sec 
the lead, as Mr. Hyde reared hi s 
ug ly head and the Anteaters 
pounced on their di soriented op-
ponent. 

With its six-foot-ten middle 
bl ocker, Chri s Harge r, leadi ng the 
way. UeI dom inated the Triton 
in all aspects of the game and lOok 
advantage of UCSD mi takes. By 
the time the Triton ' came to their 
senses it was too late and the Ant -
eate rs had sucked up ga me one, 
15-4. 

rossi ng over to the other side 
of th e court , UC D saw it s play 
transformed from Mr. Hyde 10 Dr. 
Jeky ll . With a newfound enthus i-
as m, the Tritons stormed frol11 the 
gates to take an early lead. A ser-
vice ace hy se ldom-used reserve 
Bill inclair and a kill by seni or 
Matt Minehan got the ball rolling. 
A blistering jump se rve by seller 
Satao Minami , a lift ca llan the 
Anteaters and a kill down the line 
by Jon Yarri s gave UCSD a 7-5 
lead . 

But UCI was not about to roll 
over and pl ay dead as it qui ckl y 

knotted the sco·re again. The two 
teams traded point s, with the Ant-
ea ters taking a Iwo-pointlead fol-
lowi ng back -to- back kills by 
Harger. Followi ng a time-out call 
by Triton Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland , UCSD scored two 
qui ck point s on UCI errors. Thi s 
game was destined for extended 
fram es as both tea ms trad ed 
sideouts and poi nt s. Another tough 
erve hy inc!air and a so lo block 

by Eri c Mai gave the Tritons a 16-
15 lead. One poi nt away from the 
win , UCSD could not close the 
door. The Anteaters took advan-
tage of the Trit on inability to score 
and took the game, 17-16. 

Game three ope ned on a strange 
note whe n five -roo t-e leve n 
Minami wo n ajoust at the net with 
a six-foot-five hitter from UCI to 
give UCSD a sideout. The Tritons 
cont inued in their Dr. Jekyll form 
as they matched the Anteaters pol nt 
for point, wi th Sinclair serv ing for 
four consecuti ve points. With the 
score ti ed at 7-7, UCSD felt the 
signs of another transformation be-
ginning to occur. After givi ng up 
two points, the Tri tons fini shed 
their metamorphosis into the hor-

Oklahomans Soak in San Diego Sun 
DOMINATING: Tulsa's Division I squad came to UCSD Tuesday, and handed the Tritons a 9-0 loss at the Northview Courts 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

Denial is not an option on the 
road to recovery. For exa mpl e. if a 
student fails a midterm, he or she 

can ' t dwell on the 
academic blunder. 
The plan should be 
to accept defeat and 
look toward the next 
exam. 

In sport s. as long 
as a team can forget 
losses eas ily and 

quickly, it can move on to the next 
challenge with confidence and new 
enthusiasm. 

For the UCSD women ' tenni s 
learn, the humbling 9-0 loss to 
Division I Tulsa University last 
Tuesday is only a blur. Coach Liz 
LaPlante' s squad is looking for-

ward to the nex t challenge - the 
arriva l of defending Divi sion III 

ati onal Champion Emory Eagles 
of Georgia . Ranked No . I in the 
presea on poll s, the Eagles fl y into 
San Diego today to face the Tri -
tons at Northview Courts . 

" IToday 's game] is going to be 
a tough match," sophomore Maria 
Nguyen sa id . "We 've had some 
injuri es and a lot of line-up shuf-
flin g, but as long as we keep im -
proving we' ll be all right. " 

On the injury front, UCSD has 
been without the services of Kelli 
Tsui for the last two conlests. Tsui 
has stress fractures in both femurs 
and is out forthis week. An impor-
tant partofthe singles and doubles 
lineups, she will be sorely missed 
in the lineup . 

"We had all the cheeks and 

scans done for precautionary rea-
sons," LaPlante said. "We hope 
she can come back and play in our 
spri ng break matches for us." 

As for Tuesday 's co nt es t 
against the Golden Hurri cane, 
UCSD was utterly outmatched . 
Tulsa' s Di vision I scholarship ath -
letes were too tough for the Tri -
tons, and the Hurri cane swept 
through both si ngles and doubles 
matches. 

For the first time thi s season, 
UCSD used lhe same lineup for the 
seeo nd co nsecutive match. 
Stephanie Herbert and Nguyen 
played at the No. I spot, followed by 
Sue HubermanfBecky Jones and 
Jenni fer Drimmer/Kaala Potashnick 
at the No. 2 and 3 spots, respec-
tively . 

" Before the game, Maria and I 

JUSt said that we were going to 
ha ve fun and see what happens," 
Herbert said . 

"All or their players were very 
strong," LaPlante sa id . "Th ey 
could put the ball away from any 
point on the court. But we pl ayed 
very aggressively and stayed in on 
a lot of points." 

Huberman and the res t of the 
Tritons now prepare for a long 
home streteh that i ncl udes Eastern 
squads sueh as Emory and Soulh-
west Missouri State University. 

"Emory is going to be very 
lough," LaPlante reflected. "They 
have lost a couple of their top 
players from last year's title team 
but they got some real good trans-
fers and they were ranked first in 
the preseason polls, so they can't 
be that much worse."

ConUct: Kaala Potashnik 
winds up for a groundstroke.
