McGill At Columbia U: 
From La Jolla Surf 
To New York Concrete 

Roger Showley 
Washington Bureau Chief 

(Editor 's Note: Roger Showley, last year's 
Tr News Editor, files this story about last 
year's chancellor William J . McGill after a trip 
to New York City. ) 

NEW YORK-Bounding into his beige "outer 
office" last week, UCSO's third chancellor 
greeted me with his familiar smile. He wore his 
tweed sports coat with brown elbow patches and 
Ivy League tie that had become something of a 
uniform in La Jolla 's casual climate. 

But this time he was " Mr. President," the 
L'deenth chief of Columbia University, located 

in the concrete jungle of New York City. 
Dr. William J . McGill made the move to 

Columbia on Sept. 2 after a 24-month tour of 
duty at UCSO, and launched into the arduous 
task of running the 17,OOO-student campus. His 
problems raised their menancing heads the 
moment he walked into his Pantheon-shaped 
o fice in Low Library. 

McGill is interviewed by reporters at Columbia 
University 

Strike Only The Beginning 
First oFf, he came to a Univer ity uffering 

from shell shock. A student strike had resulted 
in building takeovers, and ended with the police 
brutally clearing the trikers out. The 
disorganization of the faculty , who had not met 
as a body in many years, and the lack of 
preparation of the admini tration were obviou 
to the University community after th cri is. 
The re ull was a new President, and a n w 
Pniver ity government, centering on a Senate 
composed of faculty , student and 
admini trator giv n broad powers over 
curriculum , financial deci ion and 
administration. 

McGill had a budg t d fieil of $11 million (a nd 
15.6 million proj ct d for lh curr nl fis al 

year) to cop with. This h plann d to tackl by 
budg t cutting ( 10 P r cent, the sam d mand 
b ov. Reagan three year ago} and "ralh r 
' riou administration reorganization ov r a 
period of v ral years." 

Next, he found student-faculty-trustee 
controversy growing over the proposed 
" Princeton Plan" for granting a 10-day recess 
before the Nov. 2 elections. In his suave 
manner, at meetings of the Board of Trustees 
and the University Senate (a style familiar to 
UCSD's student and faculty politicos), he met 
this crisis by forcing the Senate (which includes 
students with full voting powers) to take a stand 
against the original motion of last May and 
instead allow for a four-day recess. 

To understand how McGill has been able to 
make the plunge into the "big time" of 
university administration, it might be useful to 
review briefly how he handled problems at 
UCSO during its crisis hours from August 1968 
to August 1970. 

Used " Hard Nosed" Policy 
McGill 's basic strategy was to display a hard 

nosed posture before the UC Board of Regents, 
coupled with a nervous game of brinkmanship 
vis-a-vis the faculty and stuents at home. 

In the first instance, he maneuvered 
effectively to force on the Regents the 
reappointment of Dr. Herbert Marcuse to 
UCSO's Philo ophy Department in the winter of 
1968-1969, in the face of tremendous pre sure 
from the San Diego community and the 
outspoken (ury of Gov. Reagan and Co. 

This victory (heralded even by Marcu e 
himself ) first drew McGill into the national 
spotlight and gave Cobmbia pre ident-seeker 

·a new option. 
As for McGill 's game-plan with the 

professors, McGill has said he had to push and 
shove to get UCSO's phlegmatic faculty to take 
a stand, make a decision , or even attract a 
quorum to it often marathon Acad mic Senate 
meetings. 

Behind-the- cenes negotiations over 
appointments wounded th pride of severa l 
department heads and drove the fir t provost of 
Third College, hi tory professor Armin 
Rappaport, to resign reluctantly. 

Even now, McGill has no happy thought about 
U SO's faculty as a whole . 

" Some of them back in San Diego, " he told 
me, "say they n ed their old chancellor back. I 
say that they are the one that have to take th 
stand- no one is going to do it for them. " 

McGill often praised the dozen or 0 
professor who would back him in times of 
stress. But he would never refrain from 
disparaging tho e who preferred to thr?w up 
their hands and continue their work while the 
campus uffered . 

Murphy Played Important Role 
How about th students? orne observers (e.g. 

AS leaders, student media chiefs) credit his 
overall succe s with the b hind-the-scenes foot-
and-mouth work of Vice- hancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy. Murphy, who 
has had an easy rapport with th e factions of 
th stud nt body, took much re pon ibilit for 
ke ping the chanc 1I0r from " bl~wing i~" on .a 
number of 0 ca ion . However, hiS relatIOn hip 
with radical student wa strain d and oft n 
hostile and this contribut d to th ir In rea ing 
militancy. 

But McGill had hi own method of d aling 
with dis('ont nt d tudents. On 0 casion I and 
that wa too rare, according to AS big-wig 1. he 
would ' troll into Revelle Plaza nd engag in 
"confrontation conver alion" with ('onrern d 
' tud nt . P rhaps most m morabl on thl

University Student Activities Center after his appointment to the presidency of Columbia had been 
announced. 
confrontation, many students appreciated the 
chancellor's presence. 

The fact that McGill did not appear at other 
crucial times, such as after the Kent State 
tragedy in May, when the University was closed 
for the weekend, or after the elf-immolatiop of 
Muir student George Winne a few days later, 
perhaps made students skeptical of the 
chancellor's motives. Students often said that in 
these situations he talked much but said very 
little. 

The chancellor 's best policy was to hold 
meetings with student away fr'om the high-
pitched atmosphere of the Plaza or USB 2722. 
After an initial period of misunderstanding, 
hi handling of Third College in 1969 brought 
about results not otherwise expected of an 
administrator, mainly because McGill could 
negotiate quietly with black and brown stud nts 
over the Lumumba-Zapata Uemands of 1968. 

McGill 's presentation of the final Third 
College plan tQ the UC Board of Regent and the 
public assured it comparatively ea y 
acceptance. His external public relation were 
extremely ef[eclive, balancing off the forces of 
the public , pre , and the Regents to hold his 
position in the be t po sible light. 

Strategie Unchanged 
It was obvious when I met him again in hiS 

pacious office in Morningside Heights that he 
was applying imilar trategies of attack in the 
East. 

The difference , of cour , i that Columbia is 
not used to uch a politically sophi ticated 
president as it now ha . A the New York Time 
Magazine de cribe him, " he will face 'the 
challenge of our time ' in a style not at all 
reminiscent of ichola Murray Butler, Dwight 
D. Eisenhower or Gray on Kirk"--Columbia 's 
la t three presidents. 

McGill Prai ed 
Martin Flumenbaum. editor of the olumbia 

Daily Spectator, the campu newpaper. 
admire the new pr ident for hi tyle--"he is 
by far the mo t open. candid pre ident that I 
have ever met. The di lance between tudent 
is not far : he show up in the librarie , in the 
activities center . and has not mi sed one 
football game." A former editor of the 
TRITON TIME can agree, " he i fine with the 
new paper--alway accessible and candid .. 

The pectator prai ed McGill for hi handling 
of the niver ity enate meeting concerned

place) . And the faculty . according to 
Flumenbaum, are unflinchingly Impre ed,

Erne Mondeville, Lote Compus Potron 
Wos Active Busine~smon, Philonthropist 

Short on history, short on 
tradition , UCSD is rapidly 
seeking to establish its place 
among the more well known 
colleges. As part of this 
ambition, Muir College, in the 
custom of Harvard and Oxford, 
has been naming honorary 
fellows. Up until his death from 
an apparent heart attack early 
Sunday morning, Ernest 
Wyckoff Mandeville, the first 
of these honorary fellows, 
played an active role in tbe 
destiny of this campus, and 
now has become a part of its 
heritage. 

As the major benefactor of 
UCSD Mandeville was well 
known to prominent members 
of the administration. He was 
comparatively less familiar to 
students. The Mandeville 
Lectures, the Mandeville Sui te 
and recently the Mandeville 
Special Collections in the 
Central Library are the 
strongest reminders of his 
contributions to the school. His 
role was somewhat like that of 
a Santa Claus, one chiefly knew 
he was there by the presents he 
left behind. 

His philanthropic deeds 
included such items as 
providing funds for the 
Contemporary Issues 
Program, the Mandeville 
Lectures, the " Dimensions of 
Black" art program, the Don 
Cameron Allen Library, the 
Mandeville Suite and Guest 
Room , and tbe future 
Mandeville Fine Arts Center. 
His interest had turned to the 
medical school. especially the 

People to People 

field of neurosciences. He 
provided the medical school 
with an electron microscope, 
an anima tion crane, a tri-
projection system, a patient-
study room , tutorial 
environment cabinets, and the 

Mandeville Neurological 
Center. In all, his contributions 
to UCSD amounted to $715,800. 

As for the man himself, 
Mandeville had been in poor 
healtb for some time. He had 
been living atlhe Monte Vista 

Retirement Home for almost a 
year . Mandeville was 
scheduled to attend the second 
Muir convocation, in which 
Earl Warren was made an 
honorary fellow. However, as 
Provost Stewart noted, " His 

heart was desperately weak, 
and he couldn't make itat all. " 

Stewart, a pe'rsonal friend of 
Mandeville, spoke of him with 
remorse. " He had a very, very 
strong personality. One of the 
most astonishing things about 

him was that his personality 
was so active, his mind so 
keen, despi te the succession of 
serious health problems." 

Politically, Mandeville was a 
liberal and a member of the 
American Civil Liberties 
Union. When asked about the 
description of Mandeville in the 
San Diego Union as " an 
irascible and outspoken 
liberal ," Dr , Stewart 
responded with warmth, " I 
think he would have liked that 
description. He was irascible-
scratchy, a scrapper, he fought 
for what he believed in." 

Born in Elmira, New York on 
March 20, 1896, Mandeville had 
a widely varied career. He was 
with the Secret Service from 
1917 to 1918. 

Among his busin ess 
interprises, he established the 
Mandeville Press Bureau in 
New York, a precursor of the 
current publi c relations 
companies. He also provided 
public relations counsel for the 
governments of Nova Scotia 
and Bermuda. 

In addition , he worked for 
several newspapers, such as 
Outlook, a forerunner of 
today's news magazines. In 
1925, while a minister of the 
Christ Church in Middletown, 
New Jersey, he made a study of 
the liquor problem in Great 
Britain for Outlook, He was an 
associate editor of the former 
EI Cajon Valley News and a 
syndicated national newspaper 
columisl. 

'Community Interaction' Returns 
The People to People 

program is alive and well at 
UCSD, but has assumed the 
name Community Interaction. 

Last year 's People to People 
program was created in an 
effort to communicate with the 
San Diego co mmunity 
con cerning the turmoil 
following the announcement of 
the Cambodian invation. Last 
year over 700 students and 
faculty members contacted 
7,000 to 8,000 members of the 
community in discussion 
groups at private homes. 
schools, churches and civic 
organiza tions. 

This year Community 
Interaction is continuing to 
co mmun icate with the 
community through the media 
of small discussion groups. 
I nterest in tbe discussion 
groups has not been great 
recently due to a lack of 
current issue~ for discu sion. 
However, fiv ~ groups ha ve 
gone out in t hi s week alone. 
One of the mo;t popular topics 
in these grouJ's has been Third 
College . It ! ems that the

current panel moderator of

was nearly filled to capacity. 

Schultz commented, "Publicity 
has been very poor, and many 
students are not aware that 
free tickets to Issues Now 
classes are available." Tickets 
may be obtained at EDNA, the 
UCSD information center 250

Community Interaction had 
an orientation meeting on 
Monday evening to di scuss 
problems that were coming up 
in the discussion groups. They 
discussed how a group can 
transcend the natural defenses 

put up by the community and 
by the students. They formed a

situation at the meeting to 
demonstrate how a student can 
communica te most effectively

Pamphlet Fake, Marcuse Says 
Editor: 

A pampbletentitled"Riot and 
Representation, by Herbert 
Marcuse" (the significance of 
tbe Cbicano riots) is being 
distributed on campus, This 
pamphlet is an outright 
forgery . I neither wrote it nor 
contributed to Its writing, nor 
do I know who is re ponsible. 

Herbert Marcuse 
When intPryi wed by the 

TRITON TlME:S, Profes or 
Marcuse, who is now retired 
from the Philosoph y 
Department but has been 
continuing voluntari ly to asstst 
tn graduate teaChing, stated 
that he would not comment

himself to no ideal absolute," 
using the recent disturbances 
in East Los Angeles to 
illustrate its claims. 

At the end of the pamphlet, 
hand-printed , are the words, 
" HUMANITY WON 'T BE 
HAPPY UNTIL THE LAST 
BUREAUCRAT IS HUNG 
WITH THE GUTS OF THE 
LAST CAPITOLIST"-a n 
apparent take-off on a remark 
often incorrectl y attributed to 
Voltaire : " Humanity will not 
be free until th last monarch 
is strang led in the entra il s of 
the last priest. " 

Whil e Marcuse has 
co ns is tanti y refused to 
advocate violence, the 
pamphlet took the opposite 
viewpoint. In on place it 
taled. " those who imagine 

that any particular or 
quantitive changes can 
ultimately satisfy the will 
to live In a world of 
mat rial abundance urel y 
underestima Ie the power of 
human spontaneity and its 
hunger to take hold of all 

things." Upon examination, the 
pamphlet appeared to have a 
strong undertone of right-wing, 
rather than left-wing ideology. 
It quoted consistantly from 
police accounts of the Los 
Angeles disturbances and 
began with the statement, " the 
various mouthpieces of the 
' left ' have as usual raised their 
tiresome duststorm of protest, 
which never fail s to bury the 
significance of events." 

Professor Avrum Stroll , 
Chairman of the Philo ophy 
Department told the TRITON 
TIME:S that Marcuse "would 
never disavow anything he' 
writte n It eems quite 
apparent to mc that he has not 
written it (the pamphlet) and 
knows nothing about it. I find it 
quite outrageous that wh re 
Ilcrb rt has voluntc red to 
help work with the education of 
grad uat' tudents. that some 
p ople should take advantage 
of him In that way " Stroll

After the longest criminal trial in Santa Barbara County 

history, a Superior Court jury refused Saturday to hand dowtl 
felony convictions against 11 persons charged in the burning 01 
the Bank of America in Isla Vista last February. Four of the 11 
defendants were convicted of misdemeanor charges 01 
participating in riot or urging to riot, and will be sentenced 
Nov. 25. Two or the accused were exonerated and the jury WII

the defendants found guilty of misdemeanors were also 
pronounced guilty of arson , a felony. But when the judge polle4 
the jury about five minutes later, the first juror stood up aiM

GM Strikers Curse Students BriDgiDg Tbem Food 
Obscenity-shouting General Motors strikers last 

barred a group of UC Santa Barbara students, who 
answered an appeal for food from union leaders, from driving i 
truck-load onto a union parking lot in Van Nuys. The crowd d 
strikers charged that the students were part of a communist 
plot to infiltrate the United Auto Workers Local 645, currently 
involved in the nationwide UA W strike against General 
Motors. 

Although embarrassed union leaders apologi7.ed to the 
students, a majority of the 100 strikers , in a hasti1y-call~ 
meeting voted against letting any student trucks onto the 
parking 101. After some scuffling and much cursing, where one 
man was knocked to the ground but not hurt, the students 
unloaded the food off the union premises. Leader of the battle 
against the "commie food " was Frank T. Shaw. " We 
want any of their ... commie food when they are over there 
killing our kids in Vietnam," Shaw shouted. 

Fatal Blood Disease : LiDked to ~~jIt!ed" 
A County-USC Medical Center team headed by Dr. B. 

Citron reported tha t as many as 20 percent of youth who 
speed may develop a blood vessel disease whicb has been 
in about 30 percent of cases detected . The disease, the firs! 
lethal systemic disease that doctors have associated with aay 
of the drugs of abuse , kills by blocking blood vessels in viUl 
organs such as kidneys and the heart. 

According to Dr. Citron, the disease may be contracted by 
either oral or venous intake of amphetamines or so-called pet 
pills. The report of the team of physicians, appearing in 111! 
Nov. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, tells II 
intensive studies on 14 patients, four of whom have died of 111! 
desease and one who is near death. Of the 14, eight are males 
and six females. Most of the four dead , died of kidney failure <I'

those organs.

emphasizing liberal arts and maintaining ROTC programs, are 
the most likely to produce campus disorder, a report to 111!

The report was issued by the staff of the Presl'l ~enn. 
Commission on Campus Unrest, appointed by President N 
to investigate the causes of student violence. These 
recent findings were not included in the commission'sgerreral. 
report published last month. Noting that there had 
steady increase of violence over the past three years, 
report stated that most recently the greatest increases 
the East, which "experienced substantially more 
than other regions, both in numbers of campuses

EDNA Given More Space 
Mike Roberts • 

In a reorganization of 
Building 250 at Matthews 
campus last week, the space 
available to EDNA, the student 
information service, was 
doubled when Student 
Activities secretary Rita 
Rogue moved her office to first 
floor Urey Hall. 

Describing the changes to be 
made within the next week, 
Penny Murr, EDNA 
coordinator, explained that a 
counter is to be placed across 
the end of the building leaving a 
reception area between the 
door and the inner office. 
Anyone coming through the 
door at the North end of 250 will 
be greeted by someone on the 
EDNA staff. A desk with 
telephone and typewriter will 

, Stall Writer 
be there for him to use. Copies 
of many magazines and 
newspapers will be available as 
part of the information service 
EDNA provides. 

One new idea Miss Murr 
detailed was a student 
evaluation service for the 
various places and business 
establishments in the area . She 
requested that anyone who 
found something he strongly 
likes or dislikes in the area call 
EDNA and tell her about it. 
Tbe staff will put all trus 
information on file so that 
anyone can find out, for 
example, where to get a good, 
cheap haircut, a realiable job 
on a transmission or a student 
discount on a movie.

center takes messages for 
people, arranges rides and 
riders, and provides various 
other services. The service is 
there , how much it does 
depends on whether people use 
it. Anyone can call EDNA at 
453-EDNA (3362 ). At present 
there are 3 phone lines,shortly 
there will be 12. 

EDNA is the only place with 
a complete and fully integrated 
calendar of all on-campus 
events. There are also a 
number of schedules and 
brochures from various places 
including information on what 
is happening at San Diego 
State, Cal-Western, the Sports 
Arena , and other places 
throughtout the city. 

" Calling EDN A is a 
convienient and efficient way 
for starting any project 
involving change on campus," 
said Miss Murr. EDNA can tell 
you what channels to go 
through and who can be 
contracted for the right 
information , EDNA also 
provides an excellent source of 
information for people in 
trouble .

"Heavv" Interview 

AS Impl imenting New ,Constitution 
New inexperienced commissioners and a new 

constitution are making this a uniqu quarter 
for the Associated Students, according to 
President Mike (Heavy) Palcic. A lot of the 
commissioners, according to Palcic , " are 
in xperienced people, just getti ng sta rted in AS , 
but most of them are v ry enthusiasllc about 
their jobs and are anxious to develop their 
skills. 

"Take the commissioner of Stud nt Welfare , 
for example : teve (Pomeroy) came in with 
just a very vague and general idea of what a 
student welfare was, of what AS was, Steve is 
beginning to identify some problems he sees and 
is trying to take action on them." Palcic 
identified some of these problems as 

- transportation to campus, parking permit costs, 
the student health service, and the bookstore. 
" There are some very solid questions that 
relate to these areas : Why are parking permits 
so high? Why do some students have to park 
way out in the boondocks? Why are there no 
gynecological services offered? Why do math 
books cost $15? THESE NEED TO BE 
LOOKED INTO." 

Bus System Analyzed 

Talking about the problem of transportation 
to campus, he explained that analyzing the 
development of a bus system involves a lot of 
work :"Steve Pomeroy has worked with the 
business office and the garage - you know, cost 
analyses, working with the legal ramifications 
with the San Diego Transit, what happens if we 
try to go into competition wilh them, how do we 
sell tickets, what do we nef<! to administer the 
program:" 

In the area of External Affair s, 
Commissioner Paul Kaufman is working on 
Student Lobby being developed by the ASUC's. 
" An executive director will be responsible for 
input of student views to the legislature. He will 
hold seminars or meetings informing the 
students of what legislative issues involve them, 
try to get some sort of feedback from students 
as to what their reactions are and inform 
legislators. The legislature doesn't reconvene 
until January; we hope to hire the guy by the 
middle of December." 

Representation in Task Forces 

Another area where AS is organizing student 
representation is on university-wide task 
forces. Task forces on financial aids, student 
regulations, and campus policies are being 
created, according to Palcic, and in 'addition the 
President of the University regularly asks for 
the advice of AS ... AS is the only formal student 
input to the Board of Regents, " Palcic stated. 
" We 're in the business of representing student 
views in general. '· 

One area where student participation is 

needed immediately, according to Palcic, is in 
the government of academic departments. 
"Students have in the past id ntified gaps in 
programming and CUrriculum and should b 
formally assisting the departments In 
developing that curriculum ," he said. "Also, 
students have a very important role in 
evaluating facu lty teaching The department 
chairman doesn't Sit In on a lot of cla ss s.·' 

Plan To Involve More Students 

But other involvement of more students in 
university government is sti ll in the making. 
"The college representatives are trying to form 
a committee on committees to involve more 
students in AS," Palcic said . " There is 
tremendous manpower within the student body 
and the AS could organize some of that 
manpower into a functional body of students." 

"Campus wide (administrative) committees 
are receiving input through repre entatives of. 
both AS and the colleges," Palcic sta ted , and 
they are " developing effective student 
representation." He thought that the best 
example of this is ' Don Bright who has 
represented AS on the Registration Fee 
committee for three years. Palcic said Bright's 
efforts have resulted in " reorganizing priorities 
in the committee." Student initiated projects 
are now being considered for Registration Fee 
funding . However, Palcic said, " there just isn't 
enough funding " to accomodate all requests. 
"There are way, way more requests than the 
number of dollars they have." 

" Very, very specific changes have been made 
with respect to arts and lectures," one of the 
Registration funded programs, according to 
Palcic. For one thing, the old Committee on 
Arts and Lectures has been replaced by the 
campus-wide Program Board which consists of 
50 percent students and 50 percent faculty and 
administrators. The A S Program Board 
Chairman is an ex-officio member of the board. 
Thus, the new board is " student oriented rather 
than oriented toward the local community." 
Concerts are no longer being held in Sherwood 
Hall in La Jolla , he explained , because, "if 
we' re going to hold concerts and plays, we're 
certainly not going to have them some five 
miles away in La Jolla where most students 
can't get to them , we're going to have them 
here on campus." 

$4000 Unallocated 

The AS itself has some $4000 left unallocated 
for the year and its Finance Board has the job of 
reviewing propo als of how to spend it. Palcic 
said it is " now developing a series of bylaws.and 
guidelines by which decisions on spending are 
going to be based." 

The work done by this year 's AS will establish 
precedents for organization of AS in the future . 

Coffee Hut: Low Cost Meals 
Imagine yourself a dorm 

resident, deciding to eat dinner 
at the Coffee Hut for once on a 
Monday. You now have the 
tremendous opportunity of 
indulging in one of the full 
course meals at low prices. 
You will surely be amazed 
when you realize you're getting 
spaghetti and meat balls, green 
salad with dressing, garlic 
bread, and your choice of a 
drink [or only 99 cents. " And 
I'm not making anything on 
these dinners," joked Holly 
Holmes, manager. Tuesday is 
franks and beans, with bread 
and saurkrau-t for 79 ents. 
Wednesday goes up to $1.89 for 
a steak and potatoes, and 
Thursday and Friday level off 

at 99 cents for Salisbury steak 
(eight ounces ) and Irish beef 
stew. These meals are served 
between the hours of 4:30 and 8 
p.m. during the week days.

A university is only as good as its 
great trees, someone once said , and 
at UCSD we can well believe it. Our 
acres and acres of Eucalyptus trees 
compare favorably with the 
northern red woods of UC Santa 
Cruz; and are, in our own opinion, 
decideJy superior to the oaks and 
elms of the Ivy League East. 

But all comparisons aside, our 
Eucalyptus trees are magnificent in 
their own right. There are great 
patriarch that stand alone behind 
HL Library, filling a tremendous 
space with their twisting, reaching 
branches. There are groves 
standing in straight rows to the 
South and East that screen the 
University from the outside and 
provide a private sheltered space 
for (the studious and the sleepy, for 
classes and lovers. ) 

The Eucalyptus comes alive in a 
breeze, not just swaying in the air, 
but moving with a vital , rhythmic 
surge as the trees, rather than 
fighting the wind , dance with and in 
the air. The trees even seem to 
reflect the color of the day, showing 
dull deep greens and water soaked 
browns in the rain, the light green 
of the under-leaf and the grey tones 
of the bark against the fog and the 
bright green and warm siena of 
spring and summer against the 
clear blue sky. 

The trees provide a wooded 
atmosphere to UCSD that is alien to 
Southern California. Thick stands of 
trees surround us as we walk from 
class to class and stand in silent 
contradiction to the suburbs and 
open valleys that most UCSD 
characterize our " permanent 
addresses." The artificial woods 
(for which we can thank the' 
Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe) 
give the image of virgin frontier a 
new start in a natural setting, of an 
association with a past quite 
different that the pocket of the last 
subdivider. 

The trees create the feeling of 
freedom and self identity that 
separate UCSD from the ugly urban 
spralls of San Diego, Anahiem and 
Los Angeles.

who work entirely without pay. 
Tbe necessary expenses are 
paid by an organtzation caUed

large degree for MlC. _ . 

The center receives and 
furnishes information 
primarily through h use of its 
tIIree telephones lines between 
the hours of nine in the morning

important job is working as a

knowledge of the subject. 
MIC 's many bulletin boards are 
filled with want ads and 
volunteer services, and MIC 
often functions as a rumor 
control center during times of 
crisis . It receives its 
information by keeping in 
constant contact with other 
local information centers such 
as UCSD's EDNA. Rumor

Resolution on the Death 
Of Ernest Mandeville 

With the passing of Ernest II, ycoff Mandeville. John Muir 
College has lost one of its most loyal memb rs and staunch 
supporters. In 1965 . two years before the college opened. he 
becam interested in its developm nt and soon afterward 
made the first of his many gifts which have done 0 much for 
the style and strength of this instItution. Recognizing that the 
te rms of public support limit educational innovation and tend 
to deny or disparage the amenities that lend grace to learning, 
he underwrote the establishment of the Contempora ry Issues 
program. the publ ica tion of " Dimensions of Black," and the 
Mandeville Lecture Series, and he gave outright the funds for 
the Mandeville Sui te, the Fe llows ' apartment, and the " Vacant 
Lot" in the Muir Commons. Moreover. his other gifts to UCSD 
and·to the community at large greatly benefited this coJlege. 

In recognition of his support a nd his achievements in public 
life, the college appointed him an Honorary Fellow in 1967 . He 
was the first person so elected by the facul ty. Later, the 
Regent approved naming in his honor the Mandeville Center 
for the Arts, scheduled for completion in 1973, to which he also 
gave generously. Against the measure of his openhanded 
kindness these tributes may seem small. Not small , however, 
is our appreciation of one whom we caUed " an undaunted 
proponelt of the free circulation of ideas, ... steaclfast citizen, 
and magnanimous friend of learning." We shall miss him.

.On· Ut·ilizing OUf Resources 
Several weeks have passed since the 

controversy about .Professor Mun· 
singer and the Jensen theory. We may 
be sure, however, that other contro-
versies are lurking around the corner. 
We may also be sure that neither this 
nor many other controversies that we 
will face this year will be resolved. 
Some wil~blow ~ver for the time being 
and come up fresh ne~t year; some will 
blow up into confrontations that- will 
stili leave nothing resolved. 

Throughout the entire process, the 
University will not exercise all the aca-
demic talent and intelligence that 
belongs to it by nature. Some people 
will volunteer their knowledge briefly 
In a mild attempt to inject some 
serious thought into the controversy, 
but never does the University fully 
mobilize its academic resources to go 
beyond the pettier aspects of the 
controversy and come up with some 
final solution. This was evident in the 
case of the war-related research 
confrontation last year. While an Aca -
demic Senate committee was ap-
pointed to find out to what extent war-
related research is carried out on 
campus and to propose measures to be 
taken, to our knowledge no serious 
study of the problems generally asso-
ciated with U.S. Government research 
contracts ,"as yet been carried out. 
. The' TRITON TIMES suggests that 
from now on, the University should 
deal with controversial issues with the 
St1rlousness and academic inquiry they 
demand. The academic process does 
not begin and end with classes and spe-
cific research projects, but takes in all 
campus-related matters. Since we 
possess the resources ' to deal with 
them, it is our own fault if we do not use 
them. ' I-

S~cifically, : t~kln9 the Munsinger 
~ase , for .. exampl~i ~ Psychology De-
partmerrt could hav.e held open semi-
nars and panel discu_ssions where. 

I 

members of its staff with various view-
points could tiave discussed, explained, 
and answered questions concerning 
Jensen's theory. From the limited 
discussion that did occur. in the edi -
torial pages of the TRITON TIMES and 
elsewhere, it is apparent that a large 
degree of uncertainty concerning the 
validity of Jensen's theory exists with-
in, as well as outside of, the Psycholog.y 
Department. If the department would 
share its views on the subject with the 
rest of the campus community, the 
airing of issues would perhaps increase 
its grasp of the subject matter and 
would, as well, broaden the under-
standing of psychology of the rest of 
the campus community . 

In more stirring controversies, the 
amount of organized discussion and 
research should be increased ac-
cordingly . While the defense-research 
controversy was met by holding a 
panel discussion and smaller events in 
the plaza, as well as the Senate in-
vestigation, these steps amounted to 
too little, too late. Many students 
became convinced that the faculty and 
administration would not act unless 
pressured by such activities as sit.ins, 
and so students sat in. 

The TRITON TIMES possesses some 
resources for airing the issues of 
controversies through its editorial 
pages and through news reports on the 
events, but lts capacity to do so Is no-

. where near suf,ficient. The Univers1ty 
as a whole, hOWever. does have suffi- . 
cient resources and should use them . 

Perhaps where the force and legal 
injunctions advocated by the governor 
and other representatives of "Iaw and 
order" factions cannot work, simple 
application of academic thought to its 
fullest extent wjll not only prevent 
future blow-ups but provide the real 
solutions to problems that the Uni-

-versity needs to solve in order to 
survive.

to liberal las with the MllFphy-toTunney switch 
in California). but by and 1arge the senatorial 
shift was rightword. 

Prior to the election the conservatives were 
slightly weaker than the . liberals , with 33 
senators in the conservative 1!olumn. 32 in the 
moderate. and 35 in the liberal. The new line-up 
shows the conservatives with 37. the moderates 
with 31. and the liberals with 32. The result is 
thus a net gain of four for the conservatives. 

This of course does not ~ive the conservatives 
a majority per se, but it will undoubtedly decide 
several future issues. In the old Senate ixon 
had an equal number of friends and enemies: 
note the 50 to 50 vote on ABM, the 51 to 45 vote 
on Carswell. and the 47 to 46 vote on paying Thai 
troops to fight in Cambodia. Had these 
measures come up under the new Senate. they 
undoubtedly would have been passed. 

Nixon Victory 
ixon 's relative gain naturally depends upon 

one 's point of view: but from an historical 
tandpoin!, the President engineered a 

smashing victory. In the last seven election 
years when unemployment was rising (as it is 
now l. the average loss in the House was 51 
seats. This year the Republicans lost about nine. 
Even in years when unemployment was falling, 
the loss was an average of 24 seats. Similarly, 
the party in control of the White House usually 
loses seats in the Senate: the Republicans 
actually gained, while the average loss of 
Senate seals is about four . 

The changes in the two legislative bodies were 
not merely shifts of conservative to liberal or 
liberal to conservative. Eugene McCarthy. for 
example. a left-liberal, was replaced by Hubert 
Humphrey, a liberal . Elsewhere arch-liberal 
Ron Dellums defeated liberal Jeffery Cohelan. 
The changes in the House (with. for example, 
Democrat John McCormack being replaced 
with conservative Democrat Loui~ Day Hicks 
in Boston) were marked by a rightward 
movement which tended to cancel the small 
gains of the Democrats. 

Democratic " Loss" ~~---,--:---
Despite what Sander Vanocur may claim. the 

Democrats and liberals achieved no victory ; 
Otis was the year of the Republicans and 
conservatives. One can see that The People are 
moving to the Right. and wUI probably continue 
to do so. With this ideological win for the 
Pre iden!. we ought to see some fortifying 
decisions come from the hollows of Foggy 
Bottom as Congress becomes increasingly 
effective.

The 1970 elections are over now and the analysts are working 

overtime to fathom the significance of the results. About the 
most conclusive thing we've heard them say thus far is that the 
results are inconclusive. 

Yet in campaign '70 it seems that the campaign itself was the 
significant phenomenon . With the media playing the major role 
in the campaign, it appears that the media were truly the 
message. 

TV is more easily u~d as a tool because of its nature. It has 
been documented that the entire amount of words poken 
during a ha If-hour news show is the equivalent of one front-
page of a newspaper. Also. it is said that people retain far more 
factual information from newspapers. o. tl seems that 
intelligent people get more of their information from 
newspapers and other printed media . 

But the TV audience doesn 't have the time or intere t to go 
beyond a most superficial level. Most people judge by 
impressions and emotion and TV wins hand down. The sight 
on national TV of the distraught father of a girl killed at Kent 
State imploring President Nixon probably did more to evoke 
sympathy for students than countless commission reports or 
editorials. • 

Madison Avenue has obliged th T viewer, too. Knowing 
that the TV watcher 's a ttention span is short and that he seeks 
an e cape, political advertising has b n aimed a t a very ba i 
level- name recognition, visual recognition if the candidate is 
attractive, and slogan identification. 

Thi s i fairly obVIOUS by now But what may nOl be quite 0 
obvious i ' omething both TV and pnnted media do. It i ' often 
unint ntiona I and may bc intrinSI to their nature . It is 
highlighted by the rrcellt San Jose incidrnt.

dictates. Thus, the Blackmore clarification ran on the front 
page of the L.A. Times, but was carried on a middle page in the 
Sao Diego Union. This is only one of numerous uch instances. 
One recalls a moratorium last year when the Ualon ran a 
headline featuring the violence of perhaps a hundred or so 
outside the Justice Department. The Times headline stressed 
the fact that half a million people had demonstrated peacefully 
that day. 

But even in those publications with more journali tic 
integrity a problem exists. The Times' story on Blackmore ran 
in the lower-right hand corner of the front page. but I daresay 
that even if it had been given equa l prominence to the original 
story it would not have counteracted it. Again. the reader only 
catche impreSSions, and the impre sion or violence will stick 
in hi mind more than a denial would . If someone mi sed 
reading the paper the day of the denial the impression of 
violence will remain. However. if he saw only the second. no 
strong impres ion will regi ter. 

The point is that news media are intrin ically reactionary in 
that they react to the rno t sensatIOnal news. ew of Black 
Panther violence sell more paper than feature stories on 
their breakfast-for-chlldren program. The latter probably 
wouldn' tleal'e much of an Impre IOn with the reader anyway.

Concert for SQxophone and DaMer 
This Satvday night saxophonist Ken Docn 

joins his actress wife Sherry Dorn, in what is to 
~a'Unique chamaler music concert. TIM! Dorns 
will present tile compositions of Ken Dorn. Karl 
Korte, Harl-Heinz Stockhausen, Anthony 
Guazzo and EUiott Schwartz. 

Although tile Korte piece, " Dialogue for Alto 
Suophone and Two Channel Tape" , is 
UIoroughly composed, there is much use of jazz 
idioms and plarasing. As is evident in the title, 
the piece is in the form of a dialogue between 
the tape and, tile saxophonist. The tape utilizes 
both electronically synthesized sounds and 
sounds derived from tape manipulation. The 
IOUI'ces for the manipulated portions of the tape 
are trumpet and prepared piano. 

The Stockhausen ' composition, "Aus Den 
Sieben Tagen" (" From the Seven Days"), was 
originally written for a choral ensemble. 
Stockhausen iDtended the piece to be performed 
by musicians prior to a concert in order to 
create the meditative mood necessary to 
perform his comlK'sitions. There is some 
audience participation in the Stockhausen piece. 

Ken Dorn's own composition, "Colors [or 
Saxophone Alone," is based on the use of the 
saxophone as a sound-producing instrument. 
Techniques such as multiphonics, double and 
triple stops, vibrato, different timbres and air 
through the horn will be used in the piece. 

atfiliated with the Hart School of Music. Sberry 
was originally involved in legitimate theatre but 
became . invo.lved in e.xperimental ,roductions 
after meeting Ken. While at Hart, ~y gave a 
series of concerts at the Image Theater. Ken's 
background is primarily in performance, 
although he has also taught and run a music 
program in the Hartford ghetto. In addition to 
" serious music" he has played jazz and rock. 

It is one of his aims to help brisg about a 
coming together of all three media in 
contemporary music. Although Dorn has a 
back.ground in the French school of saxophone 
playmg like most concertsaxophonjst~,he is not 
particularly fond of the style. He prefers the 
darker tone of Don Sinta, with whom be studied 
at Hart, to the nasal French sound. Doni's style 
stems from the style of Sinta, whom he greatly 
admires. 

The Dorns moved to San Diego recently after 
their friend , UCSD Dr. Bert Tureyzskey, told 
them about the contemporary music 
department at UCSD. Sherry is now in Dr. 
Kenneth Gaburo's sound and movement group 
and i.s very excited about it. Ken is currently 
workmg on a book which wil l list and describe 
all possible fingerings for the saxophone. This is 
a monumental task because there are about one 
million possible fingerings for the horn, each 
with a different sound characteristic. When the 
book is finished , it will be a great aid to 
composers as well as saxophone players, 
because it will fully explore the sound resources 
available in the saxophone, which has been long

Operation Survival points out that the success story of 
North America is written in terms of the use of energy 
other than human sweat and toil . This factor of energy, 
translated into power to do work , overrides all other 
factors in the spectacular technological growth of this 
Continent. -

The years since 1900 have seen the astonishing growth 
of power in many forms--the power of machines which 
have the ability to do enormous and complex jobs at the 
touch of a finger to a pushbutton. 

In just a relatively few years of past history. mankind 
has developed the steam engine, the diesel and gasoline 
engines. jet and rocket engines. the nuclear-powered and 
the solar (sun-powered) engine. Other new forms of 
power, such as the chemical fuel cell engine. are coming 
into use. 

But the main driving force to produce these engines 
and t? do work has been the development and use of 
ele~trlclty. The growth of ele trical energy is a story all 
by Itself 

This CIvilization IS literally being camed on a wave of 
power to a new level , a ncw plane of social and physical 
development. pr s nling great pb~sibilities but many 
n w problems. It I important to note lhe United Slates

the next thirteen years than has been used in total since 
1902. This trcnd IS why :oclal ('hangl is coming t(' 'orlh

Film Fe.ti"a' at 
The Unicorn 

The Unicorn Cinema in La 
Jolla is presenting, now through 
Dec. 14, The Grove Press Inter-
national Film Festival. The 
Unicorn will show a dozen fea-
ture films never before shown in 
San Diego. T11ree of the films' in 
the festival are from France 
three from Czechoslovakia and 
one each from ~apan, Hungary, 
Senegal, BraZil , Greece and 
Yugoslavia. 

This festival was assembled 
by the Grove Press and is being 
shown by the Unicorn, to give 
people an opportunity to see the 
kind of personal and experi-
mental features which are 
shown to connoisseurs at inter-
national film festivals (such as 
London, Cannes, Venice, New 
York and Moscow); which are 
praised by criticS and become 
influential forces in the onward 
sweep of cinema; and yet 
remain undistributed and IUI-
seen by the bulk of the world's 
film viewers. 

The Unicorn is showing each 
film for either three days 
( Wednesday through Friday) or 
four days (SatW'day through 
Tuesday). The three-day 
programs will have a special 
matinee on Wednesday at 3 
p.m., with admission only one 
dollar. The four~ay programs 
will be shown on Saturdays at 
1:15 p.m. Showings will be held 
each evening at 7, 9 and 11 
o'clock. Each featW'e will be 
ornamented with short films. 

The films to be shown and 
their dates are: Nov. 11-13

These major orchestral works 
will give the orchestra a

get Allocations Outlined Revelle Plans 
Craft Center The AS has allocated most of its budget for thi s year. Most students are completely unaware of what their $18 annual fee is being spent for . Th~ fee provides the Associated Students with 

an income of $75,000 which is to be used in the service of the 
general student body. The three major expenses are the 
Communications Board, the Program Board and the 
Associated Students Administrative Staff. Other expenses are 
salaries for the AS officers, genera I supplies and expenses, 
equipment and facilities and other special allocations. 

The Communications Board, which supports the Triton 
Times and radio station K DT, is a llocated $17 ,000 by the 
Associated Students. The Programming Board supplies 
entertainment to the campus including Coffee Hut , Friday 
Night Flicks, dances, major speaker and concerts and other 
special entertainment activities. They are allocated $16,300. 
The other large expense is for the full lime staff of the 
A ociated Students. This includes Billie London, the secretary 
who handles work from the President, Vice-president, six 
commissioners and the three college representatives. Also 
included in the staff expenses is Nora Aust, the AS accountant 
who is in charge of the actual accounting of all of the AS 
monies. The staff receives $13.200. 

These three expenses account for about 62 percent of the 
A socia ted Students budget. The remaining 38 percent is 
allocated to the following expenses: 

AS Officers Salaries

Frogs Take Warpath in Malaysia 
More than 3.000 frogs of four different varieties fought a 

furious battle lasting more than six hours near Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia . unday. The frog war took place in a swampy valley 
be ide a Hindu temple at a rubber estate. At first only about 50 
frogs were involved but soon the numbers swelled, and 1,000 
people assembled to watch the frogs bite and tear at each 
other, leaving many dead at the end of the battle. Maria 
Sooday, who has lived for years in the area, said the war is an 
almo t annual event. "But they have been small fights. Thi is 
the biggest so far ," he said . 

Local superstition claims that frog wars come just before big 
national disasters. Just 12 day before the Malay-Chinese race 
riots on May 13 of last year, a small frog war was reported to 
have taken place 200 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur. 
Although other frog wars have been reported at various times 
in different parts of western Malaysia , no one has so far come 
forward with any theory why such battles take place.

Because of their prolific pending the Finance Board is 
drawing up guidelines to control the funds. Reports must be 
made quarterly to the AS Council. Funds must go through 
University Accounting Procedures. The complete budget must 
be presented before allocation of the fu nds and must be 
adhered to. Hopefully the AS Council will report to the students 
so that we know not only where our money is going but how it is 
being used. 

What does this campus need ? 
If you or your group has a special interest, contact Tom H~ll , 

the Reve lle dean, and he will be glad to help you fmd a meetmg 
space. 

That's what a group of arts and craft minded students did 
last spring. and they'll have a permanent ra ft center by the 
end of this year. The students started working on crafts such as 
creative stitchery and pottery last year. They didn' t have a 
permanent meeting place becaus there wasn' t any ava ilable 
space. Then someone found the four green buildings near the 
Coffee Hut. They used them, but now the buildings have to be 
moved because a water cooler for ' the Muir campus will be 
going up there . The buildings will be transferred to the parking 
area outh of the Humanities Library .

center. A meeting with the campus architect is planned for 
'next week, in which plans for the craft center and student 
center will be discussed. 

There are also groups that are looking for space to set up a 
pottery workshop and a photographic darkroom. According to 
Hull, the only problems involved with meeting students needs 
are the increasing lack or available space due to expansion , and 
a shortage of available funds due to budget cuts by the State 
Legislature. 

However, Hull added, he is always anxious to do hi s best to 
help students, and he appreciates hearing their requests.

Watermen Split A~ter 
5 Goals Are Called Back 

Kathy Flynn 
Sports Writer 

Unfortunately, this article on water polo will give rise ~ the 
same sort of feelings one gets whenreadingthe front page of the 
newspaper. Everything in the same category as war , rape, 
murder, fire, etc., stands out, while the good deeds the Boy 
Scouts are doing are found on page 29. below a Clearasil ad . 

Those things in the same class as war, rape, etc., happened 
just the other day at Redlands . Just about everything illegal , 
immoral and unbelievable happened in the game, and if for 
some reason you should ever get the perverted urge to get 
screwed by the establishment on purpose, just go play at 
Redlands with the same ref~rees. Not having been at the game 
in person, I certainly cannot damn the officials with a good 
conscience . So, I'll do it with a bad one. Though we are still 
awaiting the return ' of the rooter busses for eyewitness 
accounts, the stories the team brought back are enough to 
make one skeptical at the very least. 

One of the highlights of the season occurred last Sunday 
when, instead of orange juice, [ got cranberry juice·no , not 
exactly. But, one did occur when the BOI GENTLEMEN, (and 
[ take back the title bums), soundly trounced the Purple 
Gophers. Behind the blocking of Baker, JB, and Harnsberger , 
and the offensive rush of Webster Fenton and Harnsberger, 
The Dildoes managed to push the overpowered Gophers all 
over the field , allowing Super Man in the form of Bob Poolman, 
to trot, walk , and flash through the dazed rodent defenders. lsy 
Chaves, the Gopher QB, said that the Dildoes got the breaks. 
This was true, but what he was mainly referring to was the 
overpowering force of the Dildo line, which has managed to 
compile a 5 and 0 record agains the luckless Gophers.

Most teams and players are now pointing toward the payoffs, 
and the all star games. Quite a bit of static has reached this 
poor editor concerning both. (Somehow people seem to get the 
idea tha t I am the defender of the downtrodden, - oh well. ) 
Well , in any case. the complaint should be heard . Most teams 
hate to loose- this is fact. For that reason they are mad at the 
fact that only the first place teams get to play in the playoffs. 
They suggest first and second place playoffs to determine the 
winner. The second complaint deals with the form in which the 
all star te~m is being chosen. They complain that more word 
should have been given concerning the election system, and 
that better yet, the 1M department should pick the players 
themselves. ( ow that sounds like a good, uncomplicated 
idea. ) In any event, now tha t the season is coming to a close, I 
think that it ha s been fun , bu t I will again leave you with these 
famous last words: long live the Maggots ! 

You know that the cards are stacked against you when the 
refs discount or call back a goal. Now when this happens five 
times in a game, you start to wonder why the other team even 
bothered to invite you (or a swim. The most common call 
seemed to be against UCSD (or baving too ea sy a shot. And , 
when UCSQ mig~t sne! k one in,..!:.he refs would counter by PRIIES 
excercising their power to ignore things instead of imagine

th:~in all , it was an exceptional effort by UCSD against more Rec reot i on A tAG Ion ce 
competition than usual. There were brilliant moments: Barry 

Turke s 

Smith put a backhand in a corner of the goal that the goalie 
didn't even know existed, and O'Connell , fooling around as 
usual , cleverly bounced the ball off Dean Shade's (oot then into 
the goal (quite legal) . And , for those who are interested , 
Rubber Duck Carl Strand kept the Triton gimp streak alive by 
missing the (ree shot and with it an opportunity to get his "P" 
put into the record books. Not it matters, but the final score 
was Redlands 10, UCSD a - 5-9 

On Wednesday last, UCSD hosted Pomona. which has a well 
balanced starting team, and a slightly unbalanced bench 
consisting of two players. Throughout the game the Tritons 
looked like one of those machine-like college football teams 
that destroys Pop Warner class teams weekly (such as SDS ). 
The Tritons were never behind . in fact, they were disgustingly 
in control (rom start to finish , making for a very pleasant, but 
nonetheless somewhat dull game. O'Connell tried to add a little 
excitement by committing (our fouls, Coach Becker tried to 
stir things up a little with the refs but to no avail. everyone was 
enjoying it too much. Final , UCSD 10, Pomona 7. 

Now, all of you water buffs, this Friday will be your last 
chance to see UCSD in action here at home. It would be nice to 
have everybody's body and voice there as the Tritons are 
shooting to close out their home portion of the season 
undefeated . Game time is 3:00 pm Friday, and Coach Becher

Frosh, Soph Coalition 
Forms J.V. Basketball 

Richard Mizen Sports Writer 
An opinion has been expres~ that someone should form an 

intramural basketball league for only those who are shorter 
than 5'8". Perhaps someone follOwed up that idea , because if 
one looks in the gym from 5 to 7 every day, that appears to be 
what you see. Only this league calls itself the UCSD Junior 
Varsity Basketball team, and they play on an intercollegiate, 
rather than an Intra-mural , level. 

What is taking place is a coalition of new freshmen . and 
some leftovers o( last years' freshman team, practicing for 
about two hours. They endure such tortures as the Chinese 
tipping drill , recoil jumps, the Italian army drill , and whatever 
else Coach Musof(, following the ideals of Big Bear, can dream 
up to get the team ready for a long season. 

The team is made up of such favorite s as Mike Rath , Ben 
Johnson, Rich Joy (also known as the Alaskan dribbling 
champion ). and Rich Seely, joining up with incoming freshmen 
from all over the state. Originally 25 individuals went out for 
the team, but the coach wa forced to cut all those who could 
not touch the net during recoil jumps. So now the team is down 
to about 15, and if they can stay healthy (they all lived through 
their flu hots) Mu off will be able to end a team out to 
challenge the world. Actually they first ought to try 
challenging the girls basketball team that pracLices in the gym 
after the JV is through . Although th girls tea m has a taller 
center. th s rimmage would do them good. 

On the lin of a crimmage, la I Friday the team went off to 
San Diego lI igh School where th y met a team from San Diego 

ity ollege. one of th many lea ms they 'll play in regular 
season action. Wa t hing them practice. it is difri ult to 
determi ne just wh re their tr ngth Ii s. and just how they 
hope to have a re pe table a on again t Fro hand J t am 
from the like of an Diego , tate and Cal W stern. A trength 
is c rta inly n t hl' lght in a team that can only boast a 6'4" 
center , and very littl on th way down to some 5'8" guards 
P rhap thei r str ngth I .p ed, as ome members of th leam 

claim that they can run the 100 in t n second s or Ie '.
