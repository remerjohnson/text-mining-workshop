The faculty group, which calls

"not a competent administrator" 
and that CSUS administrative 
personnel are receiving a 
disproportionate share of the

the creation of new administra-

Reisman said. ''The history or the

"We have never had a true capi -

After swearing never to return to

yesterday in the Price Center Ball-
room. 

The UCSD Associated Students 
funded a large part of the lecture, 
and a significant amount was spent

"Far from being the source of

Student Disrupts A.S. Meeting to Protest 
Council's Support for Reisman Lecture 
CONTROVERSY: Students can 
demand refund for objectionable 
A.S.-funded activities 
By Patricia Ch .... 
Guardian Reporter 

Last night's A.S. council meeting was sub-
jected to an unanticipated interruption as UCSD 
student Katari Campell walked in to protest A.S. 
funding for the "Capitalism: The Cure For Rac-
ism" iecture by Pepperdine University economist 
George Reisman. 

"I am very disappointed that the money is 
coming from A.S. to fund the speaker that many 
people find offensive and very racist," CampelJ 
aid. ". feel that I put a lot of time in this school, 

and a lot of money into this school, and I would 
really like to see my money better spent." 

Campell added that she had previously at-

tended A.S. meetings to support organizations 
such as AASU whose existence was threatened 
becau e A.S. did not fund their speakers. 

The council responded immediately by notify-
ing Campell of her right as a UC student to 
demand a refund for any dissatisfaction with a 
religious, political, or ecological activity funded 
by the A.S. 

Ironically, A.S. Internal Vice President Alex 
Tom brought up the issue of Smith v. Regents prior I 
to Campell's protest. Tom said the decision of the 
case directly applied to student dissatisfaction of 
A.S supported events. 

Under the Smith ruling, students can lobby 
with mandatory student fees on religious, politi-
cal, or ecological issues. However, tudents can 
get a refund for A.S. funded events that are reli -
giously, politically or ecologically affiliated. 

Although the refund would be extremely mall

Deadline for 
Evaluation 
ERNEST LEE: Forensic 
psychologist's report must 
be completed by Nov. 1 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Depending on whom you talk to, former 
UCSD employee Ernest Lee is eithcr a hard-
ened criminal or a man wrongly tried and 
convicted. 

Lee was arrested in February 1996 and 
charged with committing thrce rcsidential 
burglaries, although one chargc was evcntu-
ally dropped. He wa tried and convicted in 
August 1996, and he remains in custody 
pending sentencing for up to 12 years in 
state prison on Novembcr 15. 

If convictcd of another felony, Lce raccs 
a minimum 25-year sentencc unde r 
California 's "Three Strikes" law. 

According to San Dicgo Pol ice Detec-
tive James Yeatts, who initially inve tigated 
thc burglaries, Lee said the night he was 
arre ted that he had "blacked out" and "just 
doesn't remember" whether he committed 
the crimes. 

"1 don ' t know if he's some kind of Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," Yeatts said. 

Ycatts added that although San Diego 
Superior Court Judge William Kennedy has 
a variety of sentencing options, including 
probation, he said he thought probation in 
Lec's case "would be outrageous." 
Sentencing Delayed for Evaluation 

Lee's sentencing was delayed from Oc-
tober I at the request of his attorney, Kerry 
Steigerwalt, who argued that "specific in-
formation and/orevidence must be captured 
and interpreted by a psychologi t in attempt-
ing to explain Mr. Lee' s conduct to the 
court." 

Steigerwalt has retained forensic p y-
chologist Katherine DiFrancesca to inter-
view and evaluate Lee "for the purpose of 
attempting to explain his conduct." 

DiFrance ca had no comment. although 
Steigerwalt cited a battery of te t she was 
likely conducting - including the well -
known Rorschach test - to determine if 
"there is an underlying psychological or 
environmental probler(l with Ernie." 

Kennedy granted an initial continuance

'Thejury was strongly convinced 
of his culpability - they only took

Lee has maintained his inno-

Defense Attorney 

As SP&JA Director Nicholas 
Aguilar' s assistant for " four or fi ve 
year ." Lee was largely responsible 
for processing student-conduct com-
plaints and had access to confiden-
ti al tudent disciplinary files. 

"My job was prelly much my 
life." Lee said. "I gave my joh ev-
ery thing I had." 

Although Aguilar was concerned 

about " the appearant:e of impropri -
ety." he denied that Lee's arrest and 
subsequent trial and conviction had 
compromised the SP&JA office at 
all. 

"What occurred wasentirely dis-
connec ted from hi s actions at 
UCSD," he said. "The ·tudent·con-
duct process has not been compro-
mised in any way by th is unfortu-
nate event." 

Aguilaradded that while the uni -
versi t y could not have taken any 
action against Lee while the trial 
was pending. if he had been exoner-
ated Aguilar would likely have re-
assigned him" ' 0 as not to diminish 
the integrity of the slUdent-conducl 
process." 

However. Aguilar still spoke 
highly of his former employee. 

" I was shocked." he said. "Of 
anybody in the world that would be 
charged. much less convicted of 
something like thi s. I would never 
have imagined it would be Ern ie." 

Aguilar said he and Lee had di s-
cussed the possibility of Lee allend-
ing law school some day. 

"Being fair and thorough. he 
would h :IVC llIade an excellent puh-
lic· interest lawyer." Aguilar said.

There they go again . It shouldn ' t surprise us too much 
that the regents have bui lt into next year's budget a sub-
l>lantial increase in student fees . After al l, for the past 
two years under the Compact with Higher Education, the 
regents and UC admi nistrators have built into their bud-
gets nearl y $800 in fee increases. Fortunate ly for us, 
nOne of these increases has been passed on to students 
thanks to increased funding from the legislature. 

Next year. however, promises to be different. UC 
administrators have indicated that they will not ask the 
legisiature to buyout next year 's increase, It might be a 
little unreasonable to demand that they ask the legislature 
to buyout the fees. because after all. we haven ' t had any 
increases over the past two years even while admittedly 
low levels of inflation erode the purchasing power of stu-
dent fee revenue. 

However, even though student fees have not increased 
with inflation for the past two years, we cannot forget 
that student fees increased from $1,624 in 1990-91 to 
$3,799 for 1996-97. This is an increase of $2, 175, or 
roughly 135 percent. Consider that the overall rate of 
inflation from 1990-91 to 1996-97 was less than 20 per-
cent. (Assuming that inflation has been equal to or less 
than 3 perc~nt per year.) 

Student fees have gone through the roof during the 
19905. While we understand that the university has faced 
dramatic cutbacks in funding during this time, we cannot 
condone these outrageous fee increases which are mainly 
responsible for increased student debt. 

The regents and the administration must be more 
aggressive in stemming the tide of increasing student 
fees. They must continue to cut funding to unnecessary 
programs. and they must lobby the legis.lature for more 
money. If they fail to do either of these things, then the 
University's future as an educator for all Californians 
regar.less of class will be in serious jeopardy. 

"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom 
of speech. 'Or of the press ; or the right of the people 
peaceably to assemble. and to petition the Government 
for a redress of grievances." 

Sound familiar? 
Whether we like what they're saying or not , everyone 

- including Jesse Jackson and George Reisman - has 
the right to free speech. 

Do you agree with them? Do you disagree? Do you 
think they should both be dragged out and shot? 

According to the First Amendment to the U,S. 
Constitution. people like Jackson and Reisman can say 
whatever they want without fear of reprisal by the state. 

Of course. First Amendment protections aren't just for 
the known and notable. If you want to stand in the Price 
Center Plaza at lunchtime. screaming at the top of your 
lungs that everything from marijuana to the date-rape 
drug Rohypnol should be legalized. that 's your business. 
Just remember that if someone else wants to hold a 
counter-demonstration, that\ their business. 

The university is a place of ideas and ideals. of free 
speech and free thought - the very principles behind the 
First Amendment. If you d"n't care about whatever the 
protesters are protesting, you can always ignore them. 
But if you think they should be muzzled and sent home 
just so you can eat lunch in peace, weN, maybe you're 
the one who doesn't belong here.

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
BLIND UC LEADERSHIP 

COMMENTARY: Regents and administrators are too eager to raise 
student fees and too reluctant to think se'riously about the UC's future 

Nat e 
PIETILA 

Resident 
Gadfly 

A little less than a year ago. 
the Guordian ran a focus piece 
addressing the issue of rising 
student fees. 
On one side 
was an arti-
cle arguing 
that the UC 
Reg e nts 
were violat-
ing their 
duty to the 
Master Plan 
for Higher 

ing in their praise of something called the Compact 
with Higher Eilucation. This document, which has no 
legally binding authority to my knowle<i(e, spells out 

how the state will fund the UC for 
a four-year period. We are current-
ly at the midpoint of this 5ompact. 
The compact provides for a 4 per-
cent increase per year in funding 
from the state, contingent upon 
administrators raising student fees. 
on average. a whopping 10 percent 
per year. 

E\Pucation in California by raising 
fees and thus locking out economi-
cally disadvantaged students. 

On the other side was yours 
truly. arguing that because the uni-
versity had fallen on hard times in 
terms ef recession-induced budget 
shortfall s, the universi ty had no 
choice but to raise student fees. 

Besides. I argued. higher stu-
dent fees are not a problem: After 
all, one-third of all new revenl!e 
from fee increases must be returned 
to financial -aid programs. 
Therefore, because there is 
increased financial aid, low-income 
students are not being shut out. 

Thus. I concluded. not on ly is 
rai sing fees not unfair to students, 
but it is a revenue stream important 
to the univer ity during hard times,

they decide to ral.e

hat, they' cea .. to

vl"onarle •• 

UC Budget Director Larry 
Hershman's loyalty to this plan 
borders on the worshipful. Quoth 
Hershman: "We 've started to head 
back up [in terms of general fund-
ing] .. .1 think thal's a dramatic state-
ment about the priority of the gov-
ernor and the legislature toward 
education and the importance of 
this compact. " 

Luckily, for the past two years 
fees have not gone up because the 
legislature appropriated enough 
money to "buyout" the yearly stu-
dent fee increase prescribed by the 
compact. We probably won't be so 
lucky next year. Proud of them-
selves for having staved off fee 
increases for the past two years, 
UC administrators are becoming 
less reluctant about raising fees. In 
fact, the regents and the administra-
tion are coming to think that they 

Much to my' current chagrin . I went so far as to call the 
leadership shown by the UC president and the Board of 
Regents "exemplary." 

However, after having had the opportunity to ny up 
to San Francisco last week to cover this month's 
regents meeting. I am now prepared to call the leader-
ship of our fine university anything but "exemplary." 
What I saw at the regents meeting was a get-together 
of political insiders who care lillie or nothing abou t the 
concerns of the average student, the average ci tizen or 
the averaae taXpayer. What I saw. if not a blatant exer· 
cise of raw power. was unchecked power resting com-
fortably on its laurels. 

Let me elaborate. UC administrators are unwaver· 

have the right to raise student fees with impunity. 
Take, for instance, the infamous Instructional 

Technology lnitiative included in next year's budget. 
Starting next year. the UC will charge students an extra 
$40 to pay for God-knows-what technology programs. 
The intent is to direct the funds toward implementing 
new educational and information technologies. Gee. 
isn't it odd that the UC didn 't see the need to introduce 
special fees aft~r the computer was invented? Why 
does the universi ty all of a sudden have to charge spe-
cial fees In order to implement new technologies? 

Nowhere is the craven hand of politics more present 
than in the imposition of this technol08Y fee. Basically.

eCRI ARTICLE FLIRTED WITH BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE 
Edilor: 

After reading Chris Schreiber's 
article concerning the California 
Civil RightS Initiative ("Severing 
Opportunity?". Guardian. Ocl. 21, 
1996), I found myself disappointed 
in the shallowness and bigotry 
exhibited in the article. I feel that 
the staff of the Guardian should 
edit their work with more care 
hecause garbage like Mr. 
Schreiber's article is only an indi -
cation of the quality of the 
Guardian. and it only makes the 
enti re paper look had. 

Mr. Schreiber claims that the 
CCRI would prohibit discrimina-
tion by the staLe toward members 
of different races. But he makes the 
presumption that African 
Americans and other minorities, 
who benefit from affirmative 
action are inferior to the "average" 
Asian or Caucasian. And he also 
claims that aflirmativc action only 
prodUl:es failures. daiming that 
"over 70 percent of black students 
who begin instruction as freshmen 
fail to graduate." However. he fai ls 
to realize that one product of aftir-
mative action, Colin Powell. is 
quite obviously not a failure . 

Ironica lly, through his argu-
ment, he suggests that there is 
something wrong in society, some~ 
thing that has lead to social 
inequality. However, he uses this 
argument to dismantle the only 
mechanism' that allows minorities. 
who have been disenfranchised by 
a Caucasian male majority, into the 
university system. 

The higgest problem with Mr. 
Schreiber's argument is that he 
fails to offer any solution to the fact 
that African American - and other 
minorities arc nOl equal in society. 
If he supported a move like Jack 
Kemp's to replace affirmative 
action with one that was more ori-
ented toward class. perhaps his 
argument for CCRI would be more 
solid. Instead. he supports CCRI. a 

misnamed proposal, that will sus-
tain the status quo. 

Schreiber correctly claims thaI 
there will be equal opportunity 
under CCRI, but he forgets to tell 
the reader that it is equal opportuni-
ty only for Caucasian males who 
have found themselves having to 
fight a fair battle with minorities 
and women. 

Mr. Schreiber is wrong . He 
believes that Affirmative Action is 
"reverse discrimination," and he 
uses Powell to support the idea that 
"reverse discrimination" is bad . 
But Powell would not claim that 
affirmative action is "reverse dis-
crimination." What Mr. Schreiber 
fails to realize is that affirmative 
action " levels the playing field" for 
minorities who have been discrimi-
nated against because of their color. 

Mr. Schreiber represents the 
typical opponent of Proposition 
209. Perhaps Mr. Schreiber feels 
like he has been punished because 
of his color and hi s sex. but he 
doesn't realize that he has been 
privi.leged under a social affirma-
tive action. one that gives him 
opportunities that are beyond those 
given to most minorities. It is true 
that "'Our Constitution is color-
blind, and neither knows nor toler-
ates classes among citizens ... ' 
However, our society is not color-
blind and obviously tolerates class-
es among citizens. To support 
CCRI is to support shallowness and 
bigotry that have been detrimental 
to the equalizing of our society.

CCRI Will End 
Racial Preferences 

Editor: 
Whenever the issue of prefer-

ences and quutas arose at the "No 
on 209" rally on Oct. 16, mistruths 
abounded. Jesse Jackson and oppo-
nents of Proposition 209 (Lhe 
Califomia Civil Rights Initiative) 
would have you believe that pas-
sage of this measure would tum 
back the clock to a time when 
women and minorities had fewer 
rights. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 

CCRI will end the era of gov-
ernment quotas and set asides. Its 
passage will mean that a job. a con -
tract or a spot in the freshman class 
is awarded to the most qualified 
applicant - black or white, male 
or female. 

Martin Luther King, Jr. onen 
spoke of a color-blind society. The 
passage of CCRI will implement a 
color-blind government - one 
which will not take into account the 
oUlward appearance of an appli-
cant, only the overall qualifications 
of the individual. A job will be 
given to the most qualified person 
- the person whose skill and expe-
rience levels are the highest and 
moSI compatible with the available 
position. Conlracts will be awarded 
to the lowest capable bidder. 
Admission to state universities will 
be offered to those applicants who 
demonstrate ability and excellence 
in the areas of importancc to the 
university - academics, slandard-
ized tests, athletics. the arts, com-
munity service, self-determination 
and overcoming adversity. 

Passage of CCRl guarantees 

equality ' of opportunity for all the 
citizens of our great state. It 
empowers citizens by granting 
them the liberty to make the most 
of every opportunity - without 
giving bonus points for the color of 
their skin.

14, 1996). In her speech. Lucy 
Silvay identified herself as "bisex-
ual" and "a lesbian by choice," but 
this should not be misunderstood as 
meaning lhat people "choose" to be 
allracted emotionally and sexually 
to members of their own sex , any 
more than heterosexual allraction is 
chosen. 

People whose attractions are 
predominantly or exclusively 
same-sex are posed with the choice 
of either forcing themselves into a 
mold that ill fits them or embracing 
their nature and living full lives. 
(For bisexual people, the matter is a 
bit more complex.) Coming-Out 
Day is a celebration not of sexuali-
ty, per se, but of choosing to live a 
full life and doing so publiCly so as 
to encourage others to free them-
selves as well.

National Coming-Out Day was 
established over 10 years ago. In 
fact, it was established in the wake

"send . a message" (i n President 
Richard Atkinson 's memorable 
words) to all of California (read: 
key legislators and highly placed 
executives in industry; more poli -
tics) that the UC is serious about 
implementing new technologies. 

Politics is about projecting an 
image, and this fee definitely has a 
political basis when it is intended 
to "send a message." The projects 
toward which thi s fee will go have 
yet to be determined. Moreover, 
this fee was proposed primarily

Continued from page 5 
Most of the blame for this lack of 
awareness has to go to the poor 
coordination among the different 
departments who deal with com-
puters on campus. Take one of the 
latest projects ACS has had to deal 
with: the installation of residence-
hall cable modems. 

Every student living in a resi -
dence hall in Muir and Revelle now 
has cable-modem boxes - those 
cute littIe black boxes with 
"Zenith" tallooed across their tops 
and prelty red lights blipping errat-
ically. They are cable modems. not 
true Ethernet links. Like normal 
modems they transmit sounds 
except they do it over coaxial tclc-

UC administrators ignore the fact 
that at least one of these universi-

the students must vote to imple-
ment increase in the technology 
fee. They also get to decide how to 
best allocate proceeds from the fcc . 

Student Regent Jess Bravin 
summed up the cu rrent sorry state 
of affairs very nicely: "Thi admin-
is tration is addicted to Ice increas-
es." Rather than critically evaluat-
ing how the current compact 
squares with the Master Plan, 
rather than discussing where the 
uni versity will be when the com-
pact expires in two years, the 
admi nistration has decided to "send 
a messagc" by raising student fees. 

vision cable rather than telephone 
lines. 

The result is a connection faster 
than a normal telephone line and 
cheaper for the administration to 
install than a true Ethernet back-
bone. (But it is not cheaper for the 
students I I know quite a few stu-
dents who paid over $120 at the 
bookstore for the Ethernet card. 
cabling and software neces ary to 
use the cable modem - the recom-

the one I bought.) 

The documentation for the 'oft-

ly organized, but did have helpful 
diagrams. In the end though, the

The board seems immune to 
ei thcr cri ticism or political pre~sure

immunity, that is a violation of the 
puhlic trust. The regents are sup-
posed to he the guardians. the

when th<:y decide to raise fl:..:s at

That 's right. ACS didn't install

ACS was contracted separately to 
handle the problems students havc

administrators. 

If ACS had been more involved 
in installing those boxes, maybe 
their dOl:ufllentation would have

This would in turn dri ve down

" Busi ness-men arc not inter-

so prejudi ced that he would pa ss 
up an opportunity for profit just to 
preserve hi s bigotry?" 

Reisman also argued that in or-
der to achieve such an equality 
under a less- regulated capitalism. 
certain laws and institutions in ex-
istence today must be eliminated 
- including child labor law, pro-
union laws, welfare and the mini -
mum wage increase. 

"These laws trap blacks in an 
en vi ronment where they lind job

Reisman added that pro-union 
laws especially drive up the costs 
of business, which restri cts pos-
sible wages and new jobs.

hester McGlockton of the Oakland 
Raiders i listed as 6-foot-4 and 
320 pounds. But on Monday night 
at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadi-
um, he loomed as large as the four-

story venue in which he competed. The 
giant defensive tackle recorded six unas-

. sisted tackles, forced a fumble and put 
Chargers' starting quarterback Stan 
Humphries out of commission, enabling 
the Raiders to defeat the Chargers 23-14 
in front of a Monday Night Football 
national audience. 

The 62,350 fans who came out to The 
Murph saw a contest riddled with penal-
ties. injuries and horrible officiating, By 
the final whistle, the two teams had com-
bi ned for 20 penalties, 181 yards of infrac-
tions and countless stoppages of play. The 
Raiders and Chargers kept the officials 
busy, but the zebras' performance did not 
get better with practice. 

While the Charger players would not 
blame the striped men for the loss, Head 
Coach Bobby Ross could not refrain from 
voicing his displeasure with the officiat-
ing. 

"I don't want to blame [the los on it] 
but it was definitely not a perfectly offici-
ated ball game," Ross aid. Referring to 
Humphries injury, "I did not ee the play," 
he said, "But r saw that he was in his 
slide." 

Stan ''The Man" was deprived of the 
chance to perform i,n front of a national 
audience when McGlockton's hit knocked 
him out of the game with 4:03 remaining 
in the first quarter. 

In a first-down situation at the San 
Diego 44-yard line. Humphrie scrambled 
out of the pocket and began to slide at the 
Charger 49. It was at thi point that two 
Raider defenders converged on the San 
Diego quarterback. Li nebacker Rob _ 
Fredrickson (230 Ibs.) and McGlockton 
combined to create a Stan Sandwich, 
unleashing 550 pounds of NFL muscle 
upon Humphries. 

"To me, he wa still running." 
McGlockton aid. "I wa · in my molion 
and couldn't top. Right when he went 
into his slide i when I slarted to hurt

San Diegans demanded a penalty, 
because it looked as though McGlockton 
speared Humphries, but no flag was 
thrown. In contrast, Charger defensive 
end Chris Mims was called for roughing 
the passer late in the third quarter. Replays 
showed that Mims was blocked by Raider 
running back Napoleon Kaufman, who 
cut Mims' feet out from beneath him.

"Stan takes a lot of blows and nobody 

calls anything," Mims said. "You look at 
us, and we finally get to a quarterback a 
couple of times and nothing gets called. I 
mean, I got cut. But we're out there play-
ing football. Calls are going to come our 
way and calls are going to go against us." 

PASS RECEIVING 

Forced to play without their starting 
quarterback, San Diego relied on backup 
quarterback Sean Salisbury. The Orange 
Glen alum threw for two touchdowns -
both to Tony Martin - and completed 22 
of 35 passes. But in the end, his heroics 
were not enough. 

San Diego elected to receive the open-. 
ing kickoff, but could not muster enough 
yards for a first down and resorted to punt 
the football away. Darren Bennett's 51-
yard punt put Oakland at their own 43-
yard line. "San Diego

ers who elected not to tackle the speedy 
back. Hostetler finished the day with one 
touchdown pass, completing 20 of 33 
passes and an interception. 

Hostetler executed Head Coach Mike 
White's game plan to perfection - dump-
ing and dinking his way to pay dirt. All 
night long, Hostetler and friends complet-
ed short passes over the middle to running 
backs Derrick Fenner, Kaufman and Har-
vey Williams. But the Raiders did not 
olety rely on the pass. 

On the ground, Oakland did its best 
impression of the 1994 Chargers, running 
down San Diego's throat for 131 yards on 
34 carrie . These numbers looked colossal 
when compared to San Diego's 20 carries 
for a mere 29 yards. Yes, 29 total yards 
rushing. At time , the crowd probably 
wondered whether the Chargers were bet-
ter matched with the Pop Warner quads 
which came out during the pre-game fes-
tivities.

ttau. of PaIn 
Truth Crus"-d to th, ... 11_'" 

-••• 

When House of Pain 's 1992 
si ngle "Jump Around" became a . 
played-out , MTV. frat -boy 
anthem, much of the L.A. hip-hop 
nation wondered if thi s was just 
another definition of sellout. 
House of Pain 's latest album, 
"Truth Crushed to the Earth Shall 
Rise Again" marks a deliberate 
return by House of Pain to certain 
hip-hop element that they ' ve 
strayed from in their last two 
albums. It's definitely a step in the 
right direction for the three-man 
crew, but the album loses out due 
to its monotonous delivery of one 
specific topic. 

Much like the current albums of 
other established artists like De La 
Soul, House of Pain's latest effort 
focuses on the detrimental effect of 
the so-called "Big-Willie style" 
rap-fakers in the industry : the '96 
version of the hip-hop quintessen-
tial sucker emcee. 

House of Pain lyricists Everlast 
and Danny Boy make it a point 
throughout the album to go past all 
the current east coast/west coast, 
gangsta braggadocio. and display 

real rhyme skills along with hard-
core beats (produced by Everlast 
and Dl Lethal) that defy any west 
coast g-funk definition. However 
the real strength of thi s album 
doesn' t come from its actual deliv-
ery, but the overall theme of the 
group returning toit hip-hop roots, 
and the lools it uses to reinforce 
that image and theme. 

The group also features guest 
appearances by other anists such 
as Sadat X ("Heart Full of Sor-
row") and Gang Starr's G.U.R.U. 
("Fed Up Rmx") on two of the 
album's best songs. 

Despite all of its strengths, the 
album can 't seem to stray away 
from the monotony of the same-
old dark and gloomy production 
and Everlast's gravelly-voiced, 
hardcore delivery on just about 
every song. The consistency of 
Everlast's delivery becomes irrele-
vant when he rhymes to his pro-
fessed-love interest, like on "Shut 
the Door." 

The only hip-hop element that 
seems to be missing on House of 
Pain's latest album is fun . Everlast 
has brought back just about every-
thing else. but left out the crew 
enjoying themselve while taking 
OUI sucker emcees.

AfLer the multi -platinum suc-
cess of their 1994 release When I 
Woke. and a main-stage booking 
on the 1996 HORDE summer tour, 
Rusted Root has returned with their 
second major-label release, 
Remember. 

The Pittsburgh-based septet's 
claim to fame and best talent is 
their unique style of melding inter-
national musical influences togeth-
er and fusing them with rock and 
funk. This was showcased on When 
I Woke as a tribal blend of African, 
Native Americarr, South American 
and country styles. Remember is a 
reprise of this unique style, but the 
band has ventured into old world 
genres to find new musical sounds 
as well. 

One of the album's most 
intriguing cuts, "Voodoo," is an 
experiment in Middle Eastern and 
Egyptian styles. Its percussion-
heavy and guitar-driven rhythms 
are complemented by the wailing 
combination of vocals sung by lead 
singer/guitarist Mike Glabicki , 
backup vocalist Liz Berlin, and 
acoustic guitaristibackup vocalist

lenn Wertz. "Voodoo" also sug-
gests heavy intluence from much 
of Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir"-style 
material. 

In other musical genres, "Baby 
Will Raam" utilizes Greek. Italian, 
and other Mediterranean styles. 
The group also dabbles in 
Medieval English and Irish styles, 
recorded on such tracks as "Sister 
Contine" and "Who Do You Tell It 
To." 

Thematically, if When I Woke 
was a celebration of both the 
human spirit and spirituality, 
Remember is an emotional awak-
ening, dealing with growth and the 
realization and exploration of life's 
complexities. 

Sophomore efforts for a break-
through band are often shaky. Hap-
pily, Remember is an excellent fol-
low-up to When I Woke. an album 
that was vastly different than any of 
its roots-style, hippie-rock prede-
cessors. 

The album proves that the band 
has been able to mature as an 
ensemble, and continue to write 
intriguing and daringly original 
material. 

Rusted Root will perform with 
Nil Lara at the UCSD Price Center 
Ballroom on Nov. 22 . .

-•••• 

Ri verside may just be a stopping 
point between San Diego and Las 
Vegas. but local ska heroes the 
Skeletones seek to put it on the map 
with its latest high-energy release 
Dr. Bones. 

The new album transcends c1ear-
cut musical boundaries and fuses 
elements of rock, jazz, punk and 
R&B with a ska backbone. It also 
adds another dimension to the 
newest wave of poppy ska bands 
like No Doubt and Goldfinger. 

The musical talent of the band is 
expressed in singer lonas Cabrera 's 
soulful voice. intricate guitar work 
and subtle organ and brass har-
monies. The main strength of the 
album lies in its upbeat, "skankable" 
tracks. Dr. Bones offers exhilarat-
ing, danceable songs that entail the 
same savvy songwriting and musi-
cal talent which permeate the slow-
er tracks. 

With its varied musical styles, 
Dr. Bones contains something for 
everyone. The Skeletones will per-
form at 4th and B with the Specials 
and Schleprock on Oct. 28.

es the Sound System's funk y mi x-
ture of yesterday's R&B grooves 
wi th today's dance mu ic trends. 

The brainchild of K Records 
magnate Calvin Johnson, Dub Nar-

an isl' jangly indie-pop style, stem-
ming from hi s interest in recording 
methods used by lamaican dub pro-
ducers, as well as a desire for pro-
viding indie kids with dance music. 

This is a danceable record if ever 
one ex isted, as funk/di sco rhythms 
and turntable manipulation create 
overtly retro, yet modem and innov-
ative sounds. The lyrics arc more 
like James Brown-style interjection 
and exclamations than ·tory lines or

his keen sense of honesty. 

Although Bragg has grown up, 
he till ballies cynic ism. "Every-

his bitterness towards a former

with his life. 

The film is a whirlwind tour of 
the singles scene, with every desti-
nation being some mission to "pick 

up." 
The journey begins 

with a trip to Las Vegas, 
and then back to L.A. to 
hit the clubs and parties 
in search of eye contact. 
Moving on to the diners

STEPS: 
"It's good to not take 
ourselves too seriously" 
Continued from page 13 
most people don ' t know is that there's actual-
ly ome AI Gore diarie that are pretty 
teamy." It had him coming home and ripping 

the shrink wrap off a regulatory policies 
report and taking it to bed with him. 
Have the Steps had any impact on 
politics or poitical history? 

On a slightly serious note, I think it's prob-
ably very good to sit back and have a laugh 
and not take our elves too seriously. We all 
worked [in Washington/ so we' re kind of 
making fun of ourselves at the same time. 
You've played for a lot of college 
audiences. I'm more of a political 
junkie than a lot of other people. 
But what do students here who 
don't follow politics closely have to 
look forward to on Sunday? 

You don't have to be a total junkie because 
we stick really to the cover of Newsweek and 
the Tom Brokaw-will-talk-about-it-five -
nights- in-a- row kind of stories. We might 
throw in the occasional line for the junkie so 
that you ' ll laugh out loud ..Md nobody else 
will . If you know the basics and you flip 
through a news mi&gazine once in a while 
you'll be fine. A JOI of our audiences are 
NPR-types. 
Has anyone who's been satirized or 
an audience member criticized num-
bers that you've done? 

We're very careful about some subjects. 
The OJ. trial for example. We wanted to be 
careful about it because at the heart of it was a 
serious crime. Fortunately. there was Kato 
Kaelin who decided to become a serious actor 
and all that. So we did a Kato Kaelin slars in 
"The Merchant of Venice Beach." But we' re 
vcry careful about subjects and just ticking to 
the personalities [surrounding/them. 

Every once in a while we'lI get someone 
who will come up and say something like. " I 
don't like how you portrayed computer nerds 
in your show. We don ' t all have those flaws. 
We don' t all wear pocket protectors or tape on 
Ollr glasses." In that one case I remember his 
fly was down the whole time he wa talking to 
me. It's pretty much all in fun , so we don ' t get 
a ton of (criticism]. 
Do you try to be balanced in your 
satire? 

We do try to be bipartisan and we try real-
ly hard. it 's more difficult some times than 
others because you go through periods of time 
where one party is really dominating the ' 
news. Like the first seven or eight years we 
were around, the Senate was RepUblican , 
Reagan was in and he brought all his people. 
There weren't a lot of funny Democrats until 
maybe like 1987, when Gary Hart got caught 
and Ted Kennedy went running around the 
house in only at-shirt - that was helpful to 
us. We really appreciated thaI. 

When Clinton came in and the congress 
was Democratic, it was hard to find a funny 
RepUblican, except for Bob Packwood thank 
God. now we're completely happy because 
you've got Newt, you've got Dole, you've got 
Cnnton, and even Perot 's not going away. It 's 
sort of triple the comedy. 
Have you done much on Perot 
recently? 

This summer was sort of funny when he 
was doing his reform party convenlion that 
was supposedly Irying to decide between 
Dick Lamm and Perot. Of course. Ross Perot 
had paid for the whole convention ... thal was 
very funny. We did a song called, "/t's My 
Party Which I'll Buy If I Want To." 

I'm gonna miss Perot because he doesn ' t 
talk like a normal politician. He wouldn ' l say, 
"The deficit is a serious concern." He'd say. 
"Now the deficit's like a rattlesnake thai gets 
caught in your panls. You gOlla take out your 
gun and shoot it, bUI you don ' t wan I to hit 
nothing important."

JAMS: San 
Diegans hungry for 
NBA action 
Continued from pace 24 
Rockets in the '70s, and the 
quick departure of the Clippers, 
the area hasn't had an NBA 
team since 1985. The fans ~re 
ready . The dilapidated economy 
is ready. 

Sure, sure, there are some im-
posing difficulties- particularly 
of the technical kind . The de-
crepit Sports Arena looks like it's 
primed for a disco. what with the 
fine '70s decor and cheesy light-
ing. 

Not to mention the fact that on 
Tuesday night, the P.A. system 
was ridiculously incoherent and 
could only be heard from one 
side of the arena - garbling such 
gut -wrenching arena hits such as 
"Welcome to the Jungle," "The 

Final Countdown" and 
"Y.M.C.A," as if 1985 were la I 
week. 

And not to mention the faci 
that the music continued to blare 
while the game was in play. Or 
the fact that there were no ushers 
in the building to assist with the 
many ticket problems and con-
fusing seating arrangements. 

Also forgettable were the an-
noying promos. Halftime enter-
tainment consisted of a spandex-
clad man and woman, straight out 
of a Tony Little info-merical, do-
ing frisbee tricks . Or the really 
nifty fan three-point shootout, 
emceed by that warthog pig mas-
cot-thing of XTRA 690 
Sports Radio. 

Butthere were highlights. The 
Lakers brought along the world-
famous Laker Girls. Oh yes. The 
Laker Girls. Last, but definitely 
not least, the UCSD Dance Team 
entertained at the end of the third

quarter with a dazzling routine 
that made even the Laker Girls 
jealous. 

The L.A. style-hoopla that has 
made Los Angeles such a great 
basketball city was reproduced 
here on Tuesday night. Bottom 
line. San Diego is ready. Give us 
a team. What 's that you say? The 
emigration of the Clippers and 
the Rockets was a product of the 
worst fan support ever in an 
American city? 

Thirteen thousand four hundred 
and eighty-one hoarse fans can'l 
be wrong. As for a name, let's not 
stick with the moniker of San 
Diego's sorry CBA team, the 
Wildcards. Why not something 
saucy, like maybe the Tomcats -
named after Miramar's top guns. 

Think about it, Dave. Bring 
the NBA baq to San Diego. You 
give us the go. we' ll get players 
who can make a free throw.

tells you something about our defense 
today." Harper said. "Offensi vel y we 
had no problem. and fortunately it 
was enough to overcome our weak 
defensive play ." 

Offense was never really a problem 
for the Tritons, considering Kurdika has 
scored a team-high 53 goals this year, 
adding five on Tuesday. A oominating 
presence in the middle, Kurdika is virtu-
ally unstoppable when he gets the ball 
down low. Add 61 combined goals ilOm 
freshmen Ross Mecham and Boettner, 
and the Tritons possess some serious 
scoring punch. 

"[Kurdi ka 1 has had an outstanding 
}ear- he's a I~al force althe offen-
sive end," Harper said of his leading 
scorer. "There have been a Ion of 
minutes for the freshmen, and they 
have responded well ." 

Kurdika scored 13 goals in last 
weekend's tournament at Claremont. 
The Tritons beat UMass. Slippery 
Rock, Brown and Vi Ilanova, and then 
capped offthe competition with a big 
victory overthe Naval Academy. With 
a 17-6 record, the Tritons were ranked 
ninth in the National Coaches Poll 
going into Tuesday's game. 

"Ididn't think we'dbequiteatthis 
point this time of year," Harper said, 
"so we're a little ahead of schedule. 
But this last game erased aJl of the 
good things that happened over the 
weekend. It was still a win, but it felt 
like we took I o strong steps last week-
end and took nine steps backward 
during this game. We'/I forget about 
this real fast, and just concentrate on 
finishing stron!lthis year." 

Up next on the road toward a~­
sible 10th WWP Aehampionship forthe 
Tritons is the UCSD Alumni game this 
Saturday at horne. Next week, UCSD 
faces a big match-up against UC Irvine 
on Nov. 3 at Canyonview Pool .

DALE STUZKA: 
REF OF THE 

CENTURY 
We commemorate Dale on his 10 years 

01 dedication, hard work, and unmatched 
comedy he brings to the hockey program. 
An Intramural participant was overheard 
saying, "He's a great reI, but where does 
he get those zebra pants??? Also, what Ian· 
guage is he speaking? 

Dale arrived in the U.S. 15 years ago 

I N , I A 

after escaping the Czech Republic and liv- I 
ing for a year in the jungles 01 ~epal. His ~urvival was greatly due to his camouflaged 
zebra pants which protected him In many limes 01 danger. 

Dale picked up his hockey skills in the jungle when he had to use tl ee branches to 
ward off hungry predators who had mistaken him lor lunch. Unfortunately, due to a 
year of conversing with animals Dale's English skills drastically declined, and to this 
day it continues to effect him. 

Eventually Dale made his way out of the jungle, and onto the U?SD campus. After I 
several years of being subjected to Psychology Department expenments, Dale found 
his true calling as an Intramural Hockey Official. Thanks Dale for all of your great world I

Zebras lose sight in 
Monday night glare 
ContInued from pace 11 

After Hu mphries' first quarter 
exit, Salisbury led his team to a 
score, capping off a 10-play, 72-
yard drive with an II -yard TO ios 
to Martin. 

") felt really good playing," Sal-
isbury said. ''The way) got to play, 
you never like that, but it is my job 
to be ready to play at any time." 

Oakland added a 36-yard field 
goal by Cole Ford with II :27 
remaining in the half, and San 
Diego went to the locker room at 
half trailing 10-7. 

The Charger wasted a golden 
opportunity on the first play from 
scrimmage in the second half. 

Hostetler's long pass down the left 
sideline, intended for receiver 
James Jeu, was picked off by Ter-
rance Shaw. Shaw returned the 
errant throw to the Oakland 44-
yard line, and Stevc Wisniewski's 
personal foul tacked on 15 more 
yards, moving the ball up to the 
Raiders' 29. 

San Diego could not capitalize, 
however, re orting to a John Car-
ney fie ld goal from 44 yards out, 
which was subsequently rejected 
by the left upright. 

Thus, Oakland started a new 
drive from the spot of the missed 
kick and proceeded to drive down 
the field for another touchdown. 
Hostetler's 17-yard dump pass to 
Fcnner capped off an 8-play, 65-
yard e capade, increasing the 
Raiders' lead to 17-7.

San Diego marched down the 
field followi ng the kickoff and 
faced a first down at the Raider 24 
late in the' third quarter. What fol-
lowed will no doubt be remem-
bered as the "play of the day." 

McGlockton shot through the

the ball off to Leonard Russell, 
stripped the football away from 
Salisbury. Linebacker Pat Swilling 
scooped up the loose pigskin and 
rumbled to the Charger 17' before 
Russell could tackle him. 

"I never saw him," Sa lisbury 
said. "He beat me to the tailback. 
Regardless rof whether McGlack-
ton was actually offsidel, the play 
is etched in stone." . 

Six plays later, Oakland went 
ahead 20-7 on Ford's 32-yard field

Unfortunatcly, Darrien Gordon

Different Goalie, Same Result 
TWELVE: Freshman goalkeeper Jennifer Hetland proved ready for the 
challenge, helping the Tritons claim their 12th shutout and 14th victory 

By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

For freshman Jenni fer Hetland, 
a ' hutout never came so easy. The 
Triton goalkeeper faced only one 

shot, en route to re-
cording UCSD 's 
12th shutout of the 
season. Hetland re-
ceived plent ), o f 
Itelpfrom heroffen -
sive-mided te am-
mates, as the Tritons 
peppered Cal State 

Los Angeles ' Morgan Redford 
with IS shots, notching four goals 
in the process of defeating the vis-
iting Blowhards by a score of 4-0. 
UCSD improved its record to 14-1 
and looks ahead to a week off 
before matching up with Occiden-
tal College in Orange County next 
Monday night. 

The Blowhards are the founh 
Division II squad that Head Coach 
Brian McManus' squad has squared 
off against in the 1996 campaign. 
CSU San Bernardino fell to the Tri-
tons 3-0 on Sept. 16th and UCSD 
garnered a come-from-behind vic-
tory against Sonoma State last Sat-
urday. 

With their 4-0 spanking of the 
Blowhards. the Triton capped off a 
I ~-day , five-game homestand in 
which they went 5-0, scoring 17 
goa l and giving up only two. 

Sophomore midfieldcr Shelhi 
Thiele started the scoring for the 
home sq uad at the 29:43 mark, 
receiving a perfect cross from Elc 
Johnso n and depositing the ball 
pa t Redford for a 1-0 lead. On the 
ni ght Ele would notch 3 as~i ts, 
doing her best imitation of a point 
guard on a basketball 1100r - con-
trolling the action and selling lip 
her teammates for scores . 

"They made us work," McManus 
said. "] think the smoke from the 
fires was bother-
ing a lot of the 
players and they 
were having 
problems breath-
ing, but we got 
the result we 
wanted." 

At the half, 
CSU Los Ange-
les trailed by 
only one goal, 
and looked to 
make a come-

tons would have

from herswccper position fora corner 
kick and increasing UCSD's lead to 
2-0 with the help of an assist from 
Jodie KnOll . 

Lauren John~on followed with 
her 16th goal of the season in the 
84th minute of play , pUlling to an 
end any thoughts the Blolol hards had 
for a victory or a ti e. Assi ted on 'e

from about 30 yards out . baffling 
Rcdford while putting the game 
away for good. 

Senior midfielder Kelly Kramer

match in the 88th minute. receivingan 
assist from guess who, Ele Johnson. 

CSU OominguezHills is the only

nus headed the ball pa t the 
goal ie, and the lead increased to 
4-0, where it remained until th e 
end of the half. UCSD domi-
nated the first half, although the 
players didn't necessarily think 
so. 

"In the first half, even though 
we had scored, we knew we 
weren't playing Qur best," sopho-
more midfieldcr Douglas 
McBride said. "So, we said, hey, 
wake up, the core is 0-0, and 
then we wenl back out and started 
playing ." 

The second half was a con-
tinuation oflhe first, and the Tri -
tons didn't waste time amassing 
their final two goals. 

It took eKactly one minute for 
McBride to head his second goal 
of lhe season past the Occidental 
goa li e, thanks to an assist by 
Hetherington.

Last Monday night was like any 
typical autumn night. The air was 
chilly, the wind was blowing and 
the glow of brush fires lit up the 
night sky. 

The UCSD men 's soccer team, 
however, was playing anything but 
typical occer. at least com-

Tigers only one attempt on goal, 
but fres hman goalie Charle 
Levinson blocked it with ea e, 
ensuring the shutout. 

"We have been concentrating a 
lot on our defensive play and our

said. "We' ve been getting the new

were working together, and 
managed to pull out a win 
against the black and or-

College, 6-0. The victory 
brings the Tritons' season

their chances fo~ an invitation to

The UCSD squad looked like 
their old "winning streak" selves 
from the beginning, attempting to

first six shots past the Occidental

like a Halloween decoration with

Tiger's goalie and into the reach 
of freshman midfielder Cameron 
Adams, who headed the ball into 
the net. 

During the next 12 minutes, 
UCSD accumulated three more 
goals. Senior mid fielder B lake Th-

traffic in front of the goal, where 
senior forward Chris Fong nudged 
the ball through the goalie's legs 
and into the net for a 2-0 lead.

The UCSD men's water polo 
team was flying high after a 5-0 
sweep at the Claremont Conver-

last weekend. After 
defeating five tough 
east coast schools and 
increasing their win-

son to be excited. 

The Tritons, how-
ever, were nearly the victims of a 
nasty reality check Tuesday night 
when they matched up against a 
stubborn George Washington squad 
at Canyonview Pool. UCSD mus-
teredenough fight in the end, though, 
to beat the Colonials, 17-13. 

"It was a really hard game to-
day," Triton Head Coach Denny

were led by Brent Stoll, who even-
tually scored eight of his team's 13 
points. 

"Our defense was terrible, al-
most prideless," Harper said. "We

UCSD salvaged some momen-

by junior Romas Kurdika two sec-

three of the four Triton goals in the 
third quarter.
