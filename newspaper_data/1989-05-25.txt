UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1989 

Students Seek 
Voice in State 
Spending 

University of California stu-
dent called upon the State Legis-
lature and Governor to apply a 
portion of the State's $2.5 billion 
budget surplus to the needs of the 
state's public university system. 

Student leaders will ask law-
makers to roll back a proposed 10 
percent increase in 1989-90 stu-
dents fees, to fully fund financial 
aid programs and to eliminate or 
reduce scheduled increases in 
applicatjon fees and nonresident 
tuition. 

"The state of California is in 
danger of becoming a two-tiered 
society of haves and have-nots, in 
part because a college education 
is quickly moving beyond the 
financial reach of many of its citi-
zens," University of California 
Student Association President 
Tracey Woodruff said . 

"For over 120 years, Califor-
nia's citizens have looked to the 
University as an affordable means 
to a better life. Current proposals 
to replace state funding for the 
University with fees paid by stu-
dents and their families jeopard-
ize that legacy," he added.

Bush Task Force on 
S.D. Oil Drilling Meets 
By FREDRIC HAMBER 
Contributing Writer 

Representatives of a presiden-
tial task force were in San Diego 
County Monday to conduct pub-
lic hearings on a proposal which 
would allow drill ing off of the 
San Diego Coast. 

Over 300 people, many from 
environmental groups, attended 
the hearings at the Carlsbad Safety 
Center. Most were there to express 
their opposition to the federal 
proposal known as Lease Sale 95. 

Among the opponents who 
presented oral arguments to the 
task force were everal city and 
county legislators, including San 
Diego City Councilmember Ed 
Struiksma and the mayors of Del 
Mar, La Mesa, Oceanside and 
Solana Beach. 

Struiksma expressed doubts 
about the oil industry'S ability to 
ensure environmental safety in 
light of the recent Alaskan oil 
spill. This sentiment was reflected 
in a statement by UCSD alumnu 
Rick Nadeau, peaking on behalf 
of Greenpeace. 

"The e accidents are not acci-
dents. They are a logical, predic-

table consequence of transporting 
millions of tons of oil," Nadeau 
said . 

The hearing was scheduled 
from I p.m. to 7 p.m. Almost two 
hours were devoted to comments 
from the general pUblic. 

A few of the speakers spoke in 
favor of exploratory oil drilling. 
Oil industry consultant Carroll 
Hoyt said that the United States 
imports almost 50 percent of the 
oil consumed in this country. 

"As we consume, we've got to 
increase production. At the 
beginning of the oil crisis, we were 
importing almost two-thirds of 
the oil we consumed," Hoyt said . 
"The Arabs got greedy and 
decided to push prices up. We're 
looking at another oil crisis in the 
not-too-distant future." 

Several of the speakers called 
on President George Bush to 
encourage research and explo-
ration of alternate energy source . 

" I think renewable energy is the 
answer, not fo sil fuels. Fossil 
fuel are going to run out," said 
Gary Flo, a repre entative of the 
Southern California Green As-
sembly.

surplus in the state budget should

State Long Term Fee Policy, 
known as SB 195. 

the bill , which he used to recom-
mend that the Regents increase 
fees up to the 10 percent annual 
cap contained in the bill. 

Woodruff noted, "Now that it 
appears that the crisis is past, we 
are optimistic the Governor will 
recommend that this extraordi-
nary tax on students be lifted ." 

A.S. Bickers Over Computer Issue 
SB 195 governs increases to 

UC student fees through the 
application of a formula which is 
tied to the University's budget. 
For 1988-89, the methodology 
calls for a three percent increase 
in fees. 

However, due to an anticipated 
state funding crisis, Governor 
Deukmejian invoked the "unfore-
seen circumstances" provision of

Migacz Wins V.P. External Fight 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

A knock-out punch was finally 
delivered in the drawn-out fight 
for the vice president external 
position, as the A.S . Judicial 
Board on Tuesday declined Craig 
Peters' request for an appeal of 
the Board' previou decision 
declaring M ishka M igacz the 
holder of the office. 

The Board's informal hearing 
was the latest in a erie of review 
of Craig Pelers v. Mishka 
Migacz. 

On May 16, the Board declared 
M igacz innocent of Peters' char-

ges that Migacz had broken elec-
tion bylaws by not reporting 
campaign flyers and by appear-
ing at a rally on an election day. 

The Board did find Migacz 
guilty of violating bylaws by 
soliciting door-to-door for votes 
in the Muir Apartments but let 
the election results stand because 
it felt the violation did not" ub-
stantially" affect the outcome of 
the election. 

Migacz had won the election 
over Peter by 809 to 804 votes . 

At Tuesday's hearing, Peters 
reque ted that the Board con ider 
new testimony presented by wit-
nes es not heard at previou hear-
ings. He al 0 a ked for a tempor-

ary restraining order on the office 
so he could retain it , pending a 
future hearing. 

On Tuesday, the Board de-
clined to grant Peters' requests. 

"We're not accepting his re-
quest for an appeal ... because 
we feel it has to be based on new 
evidence, and [we did not feel his 
evidence] to be new," aid Judi-
cial Board Chairperson Jon 
Berke.

The Council postponed Finlan's 

proposal to allocate $360 for a 
lawyer's consultation fee relating 
to the UCSD administration's pol-
icy on averaging G PAs within the 
engineering department. The pro-
posal is scheduled for debate at 
next week's meeting. 

For 5360, a lawyer would advise 
the engineering department on 
what action to take concerning 
their possible violations of sys-
temwide University policy. The 
alleged violations have occurred 
in the department's admissions 
practices for engineering majors. 

"We have to be a little bit con-
troversial here," Finlan said. "The 
student body is watching what 
we're doing. Are '!,Ne defending 
their rights? Are we going out on 
a limb for them?" 

He urged the Council to keep 
their campaign promises by 
standing up for student rights. 

One question raised was whe-
ther or not the A.S. i indepen-
dent of the University, and whe-
ther they can take legal action 
against the Univer ity with A.S. 
money.

Many council members pointed 
out the the University's legal advi-
sors were unlikely to recommend

partment. 

In other matter , the Council 
voted down a measure to pend

UCSB Daily Nexus Wins 
Candidate Endorsement Decision 

SANTA BARBARA - The UCSB Associated 
tudents Judicial Council has ruled in favor of the 

Daily Nexus in the Lehr v. Nexus case, in which A.S . 
Internal Vice President David Lehr challenged the 
newspaper's longstanding policy of endorsing candi-
dates for A.S. office while receiving A.S . funds . 

While the council unanimously ruled in favor of the 
Nexus, its decisio n does not seem to apply to other 
A . . funded groups. The Council did not void the by-
law in question, stating only that the Nexus is 
excepted from that by-law. All other campus organi-
zations that receive A.S. monies are still prohibited 
from supporting or endorsing candidates for A.S. 
office.

Medical Center Sponsors "Dial 
A Hearing Screening Test" 

Listen up. 
A hearing test that can be taken over the telephone 

will be available June I in San Diego. 
Called "Dial a Hearing Screening Test," the free 

service spnsored by the Audiology Center at UCSD 
Medical Center is the first of its kind in the area. 

Here's how the 24-hour telephone test works: 
Using a good quality telelphone located in a quiet 

environment, the caller simply dials 543-EARS (543-
3277). He or she will be instructed to hold the phone 
firmly against one ear, and listen for some faint tones. 
The same procedure will be followed for the other ear. 

When the tones are completed, the message will tell 
the caller how many tones they should hve heard and 
continue to explain that they can call UCSD Health-

line for futher information. 
About one in every 12 of us may suffer from a 

hearing disorder, noted audiologist and Center direc-
tor Patricia Baird . 

"Hearing losses develop so gradually that often 
people don't realize there is a problem until they can't 
hear speech," she said . 

But once detected, many hearing problems can be 
corrected . 

For further information call Healthline at 543-5820. 

UCSD Extension Offers Hikes 
Through the High Sierras 

Two hikes through the High Sierra are being 
offered this summer through UCSD Extension,

The film has been hailed as the hardest-hitting 
depiction of Stalinist terror yet to come out of East-
ern bloc nations. 

The film describes the shadowy era of postwar 
repression through the eyes of an orphaned teenage 
girl who comes to Budapest in 1947 to live with her 
aunt, a dedicated Communist Party hardliner. 

The film was made in Hungary in 1984 and is 106 
minutes long. It will be shown Friday, May 26 at 7 
p.m. in Third Lecture Hall, room 107 at no cost.

U.S. Should Invade Panama order. This is the perfect oppor-tunity to show Noriega, as well as 
the rest of the world , that demo-
cracy i something worth fighting 
for . Had the general elections not 
been fraudulent , the U.S. would 
have had no business interfering 
with Panama's internal affairs. 
Yet they weren'!, Thus, as leaders 
of democracy, we have an obliga-
tion to protect those who still 
believe in liberty and justice for 
all. 

Editor: 
Corru ption, deceit , violence, 

misery: this is the state which 
Panama has degraded to since 
General Manuel Antonio Noriega 
took over. This power-thirsty dic-
tator has taken every po sible 
advantage of hi high standing in 
Panama's military in order to de -
troy the Panamanian people, their 
culture, and their country. Des-
pite the attempts of the United 
State' government to convince 

oriega to step down, he has 
managed to hold on to hi choke-
hold over this troubled COUnlr . 

As is common for most of the 
countries in the Western world, 
every so often a general election 
",ill decide the fate of a govern-
ment. Thl , in all reality, is a real 
triumph for the people as well as a 
nemesi for the losing party. In 
Panama's sad case, the frustrated 

General, facing defeat, ha man-
aged to pull off the dirtiest trick 
by sabotaging the tally sheets. 
The world has been patient with 

oriega's adistic policy, but how 
can the leaders of the Western 
world sit and watch the funda-
mentals of democracy, namely 
the elections, be treated with such 
disrespect? 

When President Roosevelt pro-
vided Panamanian revolutionar-
ies with military upport to topple 
the reigning Colum bians, many 
condemned the action. but the 
outcome has been excellent. Fre-
quent use of the Panama Canal 
by the United States ha helped u 
become a powerful nation . ' ow, 
this pas ageway is in danger of 
falling into the hands of this Hitler 
mimic. 

I believe that military interven-
tion by the Unite.d States is in 

It is time to drive Noriega out 
and allow the people to decide. I 
si ncerely hope that President Bush 
will attempt to sha tter his less-
than-heroic image and stand up 
for the citizens of Panama.

Israeli 
Terrorism 
Editor: 

A Defense of the Police 
Who is the terrorist? Are we 

going to call each other names or 
are we going to sit down at the 
negotiating table? 

Editor: 
I am writing in response to 

your editorial "Price Center Pro-
tester "( Guardian. May 22). It 
gives me great plea ure to set the 
record straight as a first-hand 
witness of the incident. 

The police officers made no 
attempt to muffle, hinder or dis-
respect the protesters without 
provocation. The police seemed 
perfectly willing to allow the pro-
test to take place in a law abiding 
manner. However, the protesters 
were using a devit:e illegally (a 
megaphone). 

You make the call: should a 
public servant who is paid to 
enforce the law do so? Well, need-
less to say, he did just that. The 
protesters could have continued 
business as usual after that point, 
but rather they (in their infinite 
wisdom) chose to resist the police 
officers' actions with violence. 

obody ended up looking good 
at the incident. Unfortunately, 
the protesters got a lot of atten-
tion and sympathy. This was not 
because they had something 
worthwhile to say, but rather 
because they assaulted police 
officers. 

Luckily for the protesters, the 
UCSD police officers are not often 
engaged in physical confronta-
tions. The San Diego PD orthe UC 
Berkeley police would not have 

hesitated to draw their batons 
and suppress the protesters with 
blow to the head. 

It eemed as though the police 
made every effort to avoid using 
brute force, even at the expense of 
their bodies and their dignity. For 
that they should be commended 
not condemned . 

Naturally. a police officer that 
does not follow proper conduct 
should be reprimanded like any-
one else, but to assume that the 
police officers were wrong or over-
zealous without a complete under-
standing of their side of the issue 
is absurd. 

Imagine yourself in the police 
officers'shoes. What would you 
have done if a group of rambunc-
tious people were charging at you 
and showing you that kind of dis-
respect? I challenge that many of 
you would have been quite a bit 
more forceful than they were. 

It is easy to take the police for 
granted. Further. it is easy to find 
fault with them because they are 
human, but ask yourself whether 
you would rather live in a suciety 
where the police don 't do their 
job. 

To protect myself against un-
warranted personal attacks by 
someone like Arnie Schoenberg 
(who has proven likely to resort 
to violence), I wish to remain 
anonymous.

Relief agency to help distribute 
foodstuffs to the thousands of 
refugees left homeless as a re ult 
of mas ive Israeli air raids against 
civilian targets . 

In a buildininearby, 120 or so 
refugees had recently arrived and 
needed our assistance. We sur-
veyed the building and prepared 
food packages. We never had a 
chance to distribute them. 

On the morning of August 6, 
1982, a single Israeli plane flew 
over the building and dropped a 
bomb (widely assumed to be 
somet h ing called a vacuum 
bomb). It did not make much 
sound but the floors of the eight-
story building crumbled one on 
top of the other crushing the peo-
ple beneath its weight. S urround-
ing buildings were not affected. 

The vacuum bomb was given 
to Israel by the United States to 
be used only for defensive pur-
poses. It was new and had never 
been tested before. Well, it works. 
It's quick. It's clean. 

Some people call this "purity of 
arms." The victims were Palesti-
nians. They were driven off their 
land in Palestine by the Zionists 
in 1948, were forced to live in

Coins Across UCSD 
Editor: 

When you're walking through 
the UCSD campus Friday, don't 
be surprised by a long trail of 
tape, with coins all over it. This is 
a benefit for the Alpha Project for 
the Homeless. Alpha Kappa Psi 

professional business fraternity is 
conducting this event to help this 
fine organization. Please toss a 
few coins on the tape, which is 
running from Revelle Plaza to the 
Hump. It's a good cause.

Israeli: Seeking Compromise 
Editor: 

No matter how incredibly stu-
pid and narrow-minded the let-
ters get about Israel, it's hard for 
me to get worked-up about them 
(whether they are Shamir-clone 
letters or "Yassir's My Bud" 
letters). 

I think I have a somewhat uni-
que perspective on this because, 
as former A.S. vice president ex-
ternal, I read many of the student 
newspapers from other UC cam-
puses regularly. Every single UC 
campus paper is chock-full of let-
ters like Jeffrey Hoffer's "The 
PLO and Israel" and Ilene Zar-
our's "PLO: Like a Virgin." 

The same propaganda over-
and-over again! Does it enlighten 
anyone on campus? Nah! But it 
does make for interesting conver-
sations at the Union of J ewish 
Students and Palestinian Stu-
dents' Union meetings. 

I don't trust the PLO at all, but 
I don't trust AI PAC either. Both 
groups may be necessary to pro-
tect the interests of their support-
ers, but they are both so hard-
line with their views that you can 't 
get a reali stic perspective of the 
Middle East from either of them. 
To put it more bluntly, these 
extremists are so busy creating 
propaganda and twisting stories 
that they wouldn't know the truth 
if it came up and bit them in the 
ass . 

As an American Jew who has 
lived in Israel , I have a simplistic 
view of the country. For Jews 

throughout the world, Israel is 
our insurance policy. It is our way 
of protecting our culture, our 
religion, and ourselves from more 
Russian pogroms, Spanish inqui-
sitions, or Nazi holocausts . 

We have learned, the hard way, 
that Jews need a place that we can 
call our own. Thousands of years 
ago, God (or, if you like. the guy 
that made up the Bible) told us 
that we should settle in the land 
that is now called Israel. Well, the 
years have passed and our fond-
ness to that land remains . 

This century, Jews realized that 
we need a nation to exist that pro-
tects our interests. What better 
nation than Israel? It has become, 
for us , a miraculous fulfillment 
of our dreams. People may call 
my view naive, but I think many 
Jews agree with me, and that 
many others can understand 
where I am coming from. 

So, the Israeli hard-liners can 
keep saying that we actually have 
a wWar of the Stones" launched 
against Israel. And the PLO can 
scream that "Zionism equals Rac-
ism." It's not going to get us 
anywhere. 

Both a Palestinian state (giving 
the Palestinians the home they 
desire) a"d Israel (ditto for the 
Jews) can exist in the Middle 
East . Peace between these two 
countries won't be easy. In fact, it 
might always be a tense, cautious, 
suspicious kind of peace - but 
life's not perfect.

No. The costs 0/ repairing

A.S.: Counci/Debates 
Continued from page t 
allocating the same amount of 
money for a computer to be shared 
by all councilmember . 

Public Relations Commissioner 
Benny Singer maintained that he 
needs a computer to do his job 
effectively. Without the compu-
ter, he said. the A.S. secretary 
would have to prepare the major-
ity of his printed material. 

"\ think it's very important that 
I buy thi computer," he said. 
"My job is to type letters and 
press release ... at least 90 per-
cent [of my job] needs to be done 
10 a printed manner." He said he 

needs a computer in his office "to 
perform my job 100 percent." 

University Center Board Com-
missioner Jason Carbone argued 
that t he office does not need its 
own computer. He said that Mac's 
Place, located in the Price Center, 
rents out computer time, and th~t 
using thi enterprise is more effec-
tive than buying a computer. 

Carbone said that although 
Singer would probably make good 
use of the computer, future public 
relations commi sioners might 
nOl. 

"Benny might be the best per-
on in the world and use thi thing 

NEWS 

to death." he said. but added that 
next year's commissioner could 
turn out to be "a flake." 

The Council argued at length 
on the is ue, debating whether 
Singer needed his own computer 
or could share one with the rest of 
the A.S. councilmembers. 

At one point. Warren Sopho-
more Senator Craig Sneiderman 
said, "\ think it's really pathetic if 
[we] ean 't get together and share a 
computer. Thi debate has gone 
on long enough ... 

The Council did not implement 
inger' measure but approved 

spending $1,893 to purchase a 
computer to be shared by all A.S. 
councilmem bers.

Peters added that he has no 
plan to pursue the case further 
and said that he is "done" fighting 
for the position. 

"Inside my own self, I'll fight it, 
but outside I won't fight it any-
more," he s!lid.

Christopher Enghol m is what

Since graduating from UCSD 
in 1983, Engholm has travelled 
extensively through China, Rus-
sia and the Mediterranean, pro-
du ced a n educat ional video , 
started an international business 
c onsultancy, and become a 
recognized expert in the field of 
Asian-American trade.

depth analysis of Chinese business 
pohcy, with comprehensive advice 
to American companies that are 
considering expansion into the 
mainland Chinese market. 

"American negotiators are very 
good at persuading. They're good 
at sitting down and making a 
claim and then per uading the 
other side that it's correct. They're 
not really good at making per-
onal connections with a foreign, 

bu iness counterpart - especially 
an Asian one," Engholm said , 

"One of the worst mistakes that 
American companies make in 
China is that they perceive their 
Chinese negotiator as the decision 
maker. In fact, the Chinese nego-
tiator is really just a pokes person 
for a whole number of decision 
makers at different levels of their 
bureaucracy. ~ 

Little in Engholm's UCSD 
background would have suggested 
the making of a future busine s 
consultant. He majored in his-
tory, with minors in music and 
writing, Hi special interests at 
school included photography and 
Third World studies. The Che 
Cafe served as a showplace for hi 
talents as a mu ician when he 
would appear with his band , the 
Trousers. 

He has managed to put his 
diverse interests and hobbies to 
use in the course of his career. 

In 1985, while establishing his 
own photography studio in Ber-

Nonetheless, he is optimistic 
about the long-range political 
prospects, and pro pects for U.S. 
trade. "It's not an anti-American 
movement," he noted. 

Engholm's current book is The 
Pacific Rim Venture: Asia Strate-
gies/or Corporate America, which 
will have a broader focus than his 
previous work, and will include 
all of the countries of the Asian-
Pacific arena. 

His advice to companies is to 
coordinate their marketing strat-
egies in all of the Asian countries 
where they conduct business. 

Engholm will turn his atten-
tion to the Soviet Union in his 
book The Glasnost Venture: 

"American negotiators are very good at persuading. They're good at 
.. . making a claim and then persuading the other side that it 's cor-
rec!' '' Engholm said. 

Secrets of elling 10 Russia, to be 
published next year. The major 
obstacle to economic growth in 
Russia, as in China, is re-orienting 
the economy to one controlled by 
price, rather than by political pull 
and control, Engholm said, There 
is even a Chinese term, 
Guan-Xi, for the ort of political-
economic quid pro quo by which 
goods and favors are exchanged, 
Engholm noted . 

pany putting together an invest-
ment prospectus in China. Once 
in China, he soon became actively 
involved in the negotiations 
between his employer and the 
Chine e companies, who were 
then involved in setting up joint 
ventures in cotton production and 
trading various commodities. 

Upon his return, Engholm 
realized that his wealth of slides 
and notes from his travels would 
be valuable educational material. 
He set about producing and mar-
keting a slide-graft video with his 
own music and narration, The 
Quiet Revolution: A Porlrait of 
China in Ihe 1980s. 

Since then, he has travelled 
throughout China on business 
and to conduct research inter-
views with people in Chinese 
management positions. 

He formed a company called 
Pacific Rim Ventures in 1985, 
which acts not only as a consul-
tant to American firms , but also 
as an American liaison to the U .. 
market for Chinese companies. 

"If our exports to China con-
tinue to expand at the rate they 
did last year, then by t 995 we will 
sell as many exports to China as 
we do to Japan right now," 
Engholm predicts. 

He admires the ambitious 
approach the Japanese have taken 
in China over the past decade. 
-" American companies are hesitant 
to get in volved because they 
view it as a long..(erm payoff with 
a lot of ri sk involved." 

Engholm is encouraged by the 
economic reforms brought about 
by" Communist Party General 
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, In par-
ticular, he cites the Enterprise 
Responsibility System, which 
a Ilows managers more freedom to

"China has been really effective 
in opening the door to over 6,000 
contracts with foreign firms, 
involving a whole array of differ-
ent types of ventures ... These 
experiments are working!" 

Engholm attributes the recent 
student strikes and general upris-
ing to the lack of political reforms 
synchronous to these economic 
reforms. He predicts political 
reform to be the next logical step 
in what might be called China's 
"unquiet" revolution. 

"This is a mass defection of not 
just students, but doctors, den-
tists, lawyers, teachers, intellectu-
als. workers and some peasants: a 
cross-section in rebellion against 
the government," Engholm said . 

Engholm's advice to student 
considering a career in interna-
tional business is to learn lan-
guages and consider becoming 
involved with a technical exchange 
program. Such programs - as 
with the Soviet Union - are a 
good way of making contacts 
within a foreign country. Also, 
foreign academicians often be-
come businesspeople after they 
have completed their research. 

"It's a wide-open field," Eng-
holm said . "Ifyou've got interna-
tional talent. you're hired . If 
you've got business and language 
skills, you can write your own 
ticket. .. 

According to Engholm, American negotiators are "not really good at 
making personal connections with a foreign business counterpart."

Six UCSD Athletes to Compete in Illinois 

Track and Field Nationals This Week 
Triton Golf in 11th 
Place; Thomas in 
Sixth at National 
Tournament 

By PHIL GRUE 
Sports Edilor 

If nothing else, the UC 0 track 
and field quad has a bright futu re. 
Yesterday, IX members of the 
team headed to the Divi ion III 
National Champion hip at North 
Central College in Illinois - five 
of whom are eit her first or second 
year students. 

The Tritons' brightest hope for 
a top mark at the national meet 
rides with sophomore Shannon 
Quigley, who is competing in both 
the shot put and di cus events this 
week. Quigley held one of the 
nation's top marks for Divsion III 
earlier this year, and this weekend 
will get a chance to find out how 
she compares with the nation's 
best in head-to-head competition. 

Sprinter Andrea Kouremetis is 
also competing in two even ts -
the 100- and 200-meter dashes. 
But , according to Head Coach 
Mark tanforth, she has a much 
better chance of becoming an All-
American in the 200 than the 100. 
In most events, the top six fin-
ishers gain All-American status. 
Kouremetis qualified for the finals 
of the 200 meter yesterday when 
he ran a 24.73 to finish second in 

her heal. She fi nished with the 
third best time overall. 

Peler Messrobian/ Guardian 

By BRIAN !TOW 
Conrributing Sports Edilor 

At the midpoint of the 
Division 1Il ational Champ-
ionships, UCSD sophomore 
Devin Thomas is holding 
ixth place within striking 

distance of the individual title. 
The team itself has not fared 
quite as well, and is now sit-
ting in eleventh place, 33 
strokes behind Cal State 
S ta nisla us. 

CS U Stanislaus is current-
ly leading the tournament 
with a two-day score of 596. 
ft remains just five strokes 
ahead of a surprising Metho-
dist College (North Carolina) 
squad , 

The national meet officially 
began yesterday, and will run 
through Saturday. Yesterday, four 
Tritons competed in qualifying 
heats for their events and one 
Triton - distance runner Michelle 
Con lay - competed in the one 
and only heat of the 10,000 meter 
run. 

Andrea Kouremetis qualified for Friday's nalional final in the 200 
meters yesterday when she finished with a 24.73 time. 

The Tritons fell from sixth 
to eleventh place on the 
second day as each of their 
top four golfers fell off the 
pace they had set in the first 
round. Despite the drop, 
UCSD remains only six 
strokes behind fifth place 
GustaVUS-Adolphus. UCSD 
came into the clubhouse at 
629 strokes; Gustavus-Adol-
phus entered at 623 . 

Peter Messrobian / Guardian 
Sophomore Scott Sargeant -
shown here competing in the 
shotput - advanced to Friday's 
final in the hammer lhrow. 

Conlay, in a race that did not 
begin until 8:30 p.m ., ran a 38:42 
to finish 13th in a field of 18 or so. 
Anna Prineas from Carleton Col-
lege won the event with a time of 
35:10. 

"She has had a great season," 
Stanforth said of Conlay. "[She 
has] run a lot fas ter than I 
anticipated ... 

Concerning Nationals as a 
whole, Stanforth is not expecting 
amazing performances from his 
athletes . 

"If they just go in there and 
compete ,. , [if they] just give it a 
shot, that would be fine with me," 
he explained. "We'd be happy if 
three or four out of six [of the 

UCSD athletes who made the 
trip] make All- American. Any 
more than that would be a bonus. ~ 

Aside from Quigley, Koureme-
tis, and Conlay, three other Trit-
ons qualified for the national meet. 

Pole-vaulter Marc Lawler, the 
senior member of the national 
squad, qualified in the middle of 
the year when he cleared the 
required 15' 1 H height. Yesterday 
he did it again in the qualifying 
vault , advancing to Friday's final. 

Scott Sargeant is the Tritons' 
representative in the hammer 
throw, but his scheduled qualify-
ing throw was canceled yesterday

because there were less than 15 
people competing for the 12 spots 
in the finals . Therefore, all 
hammer-throwers automatically 
advanced to Friday's final. Qui-
gley also advanced to the final in 
the shotput for similar reasons . 

The other Triton who made the 
trip is Rachel Beerman, who has 
been in Quigley's shadow all year 
in the discus event. According to 
Stanforth, Beerman will have to 
throw a "PR" - a personal record 
- in order to make it to All-
American qualifying ranks. He 
also explained that Quigley, how-
ever, is likely to finish in the top 
three jf she "throws like she has 
been. " 

The finals for most events will 
be on either Friday or Saturday. 
Of the events concerning Triton 
athletes, the finals in the pole 
vault , hammer, shotput, and the 
200 meters will be on Friday, and 
the finals of the discus and 100 
meters will be on Saturday. 

Finals results will be printed in 
Monday's issue of the Guardian. 

After the first day of com-
petition, Thomas found him-
self tied for the third place, 
only one stroke behind co-
leaders Fred Winn inger of 
Claremont-Mudd, and Mark 
H utchin on. Both scored a 
72, and Thomas shot a 73. 

Thomas slowed down yes-
terday, shooting a 78 while 
Hutchinson continued to set a 
blistering pace with a 71. 
Hutchinson's two-day score of 
143 put him five strokes ahead 
of his closest competitor, Greg 
Wilhelm of Ohio Wesleyan. 
Wilhelm held a combined 
score of 148. Thomas re-
mained easily within striking 
distance of second place with 
a score of 151. 

Two days remain in the 
four day, 20-team tourna-
ment.

III ne, two, three. One, two, three," my (!.J partner hisses through clenched teeth, a 
grim, determined look on his face. "One, 

two, three, one, two ... " 
Then he starts to smile, and relaxes the vice-

like grip he has on my hand. He's stopped 
~hinking the rhythm and begun to simply feel 
It. 

We whirl around the dance floor, secure in 
each other's arms, moving t9gether effortlessly 
like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Alright, 
maybe I'm getting carried away. ActuaJly, it's a 
Monday night and we're both in jeans and ten-
nis shoes. Even though he's still counting we 
are dancing and it is wonderful. 

If you had asked me what my favorite class 
was last quarter, around eighth week I would 
have told you ballroom dance. Taught through 
the P.E. department, the classes have always 
been popular and often fill quickly. 

Ballroom dance is making something of a 
comeback. An article appearing in The Smilh-
sonian last month states that the membership 
of the U.S. Amateur Ballroom Dancers Asso-
ciation, which has chapters in 24 states, has 
doubled in the past five years. 

At last year's U.S. Ballroom Championships 
more than 2,()()() dancers from across the coun-
try and 20 other nations showed up

Students Pluck Competition 
by david estrada 

hiatus intern 

Martin Glicklich and Sarah Elizabeth Coade, both UCSD students. shined at the La Jolla Civi 
Symphony Orchestra and Chorus last April 10 for the 34th annual Youn~ Artists Competition. If 
you mi ed the contest , you can still see the talented musicians perform on June 4. 

As winners of the competitio n. Glicklich and Coade have earned the opportunity to play a concerto 
with an accompanying professional orchestra, the La Jolla Civic Symphony. 

The competition is directed to wards upcoming musicians aged 15 through 26. Glicklich and Coade 
pluck~d up the strings category. merely one of the five open categories of the contest: strings, piano, 
woodwinds, brass/ percussion and vocals. 

Past winners have often gone on to exciting careers, such as Nicholas Grant who won the 
competition over 20 years ago. Grant is now the second violin and assistant concert master in the San 
Diego Symphony. "It was an educational experience," Grant said . "[It was] the first concert I 
performed at that I was reviewed by the local press. " 

At the age of eight. Marrin Glicklich started playing the flute . In the beginning. " Playing was just for 
fun. but it became more of a hobby." Through high school Glicklich played off and on and "decided 
against music" when he enrolled at UCSD. Glicklich 's father is a physician so he felt obligated to try 
Bio-Chemistry as a major. But after three years at UCSD, he decided that a future in !Tledicine wasn't 
for him. So he transferred to California State University, Northridge, because of the school's strong 
music department. "UCSD doesn't have as many opportunities for playing and performance." 
Martin explained. 

At the competitio n, Glicklich played a piece by Carl Mielsen called Concerto for Flute and 
Orchestra. Martin beat o ut the 20 or so other competitors in the string competition and won the $500 
cash prize. Now 24. he has a final year to go before getting his Bachelor of Music degree from CSUN. 

Sarah Elizabeth Coade initially began playing the violin "because my parents thought that the bass 
was too big for me ." When she was older she moved up to the cello; while at Oberlin college she

• Sunday night, the Bacchanal will be transformed into a hothouse 
for two of the most exciting bands around: Guadalcanal Diary and 
Treat Her Right. Though most anending the show will be there to 
see Guadalcanal Diary. it just might be Treat Her Right who stands 
out. Treat Her Right is a bluesy quartet which dishes out 'gritty, 
twangy rock and roll. On their latest RCA album, Tied!O the Tracks, 
the Boston-based band makes you feel like you're on the porch lis-
tening to blues at a country barbeque.,

Student Competition 
Continued from paF 2 
started playing the double bass. 
Coade got her Bachelors of Music 
from the Oberlin Conservatory of 
Music and later went on to study 
the double bass at UCSD while 
working toward a Masters degree. 
In January she "put her Masters 
on hold to concentrate on the 
double bass." 

Currently studying with UCSD 
Professor Bertream T uretzky, 
Coade is also freelancing around 
her native San Diego. she has 
worked for such notables as both 
the Joffrey Ballet and The Ameri-
can Ballet Theater. Coade likes to 
playa wide variety of music, but 
her favorites are Mozart, Cope-
land and Stravinsky. 

Both artists would eventually 

like to play with a major sym-
phonic orchestra . Glicklich's 
future plans are to study at the 
Royal Northern College of Music 
in Manchester England. He is 
planning to use the $500 to take a 
class with Trevor Wie. 

While Coade's immediate plans 
for the future are to play with a 
fellowship from the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Orchestra, she has 
also considered teaching at the 
University level. "[I'd enjoy teach-
ing] at a srnall liberal arts college 
or at a university. perhaps even at 
UCSD." 

The concert, with the winners 
of the competition. is scheduled 
for June 4th at UCSD's Mande-
ville Center. Tickets are $6 for 
students and $8 for general ad-
mission.

Why pay $6 for a bad movie 
when you can see five great plays 
for only $l! 

As part of UCSD's Under-
graduate Theatre Festival , five dif-
ferent student-written plays will 
be opened to the public beginning 
Wednesday, May 24. 

The Festival began nine years 
ago as an opportunity for students 
to direct, write, act and design 
their own productions. 

Students working on the plays 
began researching, writing and 
rehearSing as early as October of 
last year.

dedication. as well as numerous 
others that we couldn't do

The plays to be performed are: 
Not the &lIetwritten by Paul Ryer 
which is about a young boy and 
his hilarious yet philosophical 
search for the meaning of life. It is 
directed by John Choen. Neal Bai-
ley wrote Vertical Flight-a musi-
cal jazz piece that takes place in a 
1940's nightclub and tells the story 
of "hopeless wanderers, sexy 
women, and cool cats ." Vertical 
Flight is directed by Ben Gold-
stone. Plowshares, directed by Kelly 
Alexendre and wrinen by Chris 
Humphery, is set on a Missouri

Artistic director and graduating 

senior, Suzanne Auster , com-
mented on the difficult but excit-
ing process of creating such a pro-
duction. " W e decided to try lots 
of new things this year, from a 
unit set to the marathon perfor-
mance schedule of all five shows 
every night. 

" It is a matter of trial and 
error," said Auster, "and who 
knows if all that we 've attempted 
will be the same next year , but we 
figured we had to give it a try. It is 
amazi ng how much wo rk it takes 
to put on a festival like this, but 
there's a real strong core of people 

farm. The seeming story of two 
brothers is really a story of the 
instability of our planet and the 
ominous threat of nuclear destruc-
tion.

dozen titles, and $50,000 in cash 
and prizes. 

For me, the appeal of ballroom 
dance is in the pleasure of moving 
with someone. I admit nostalgia 
has a lot to do with it as well. 
Although he was scornful of his 
era, F. Scott Fitzgerald has instilled 
in me a longing to dance the night 
away under the stars. Marshall 
Stern's description of Sunday 
nights at the Savoy dance hall in 
Harlem in Jazz: Dance makes me 
yearn for a similar creative outlet. 
1 listen to old Duke Ellington 
records and dance in front of the 
mirror, my bathrobe a ball gown. 

There are more practical rea-
sons for the increased interest in 
ballroom dance. "An entire gen-
eration grew up in the rock era, 
starting in the '60s and '70s, and 
they never ever danced together," 
says Larry Schulz, co-owner of the 
Sandra Cameron Dance Center. 
"Now they're at an age where they 
find themselves in professional 
situations - company functions, 
galas, balls - that require a cer-
tain sophistication. You can't jusf 
get up and disco all night." 

Despite the conservativism of 
ballroom dance (the man leads, 
the woman follows) its emergence 
at the beginning of this century as 
a popular past-time was a reflec-
tion of and an influence on the 
women's movement. In the fox 
trot, popularized during the teens, 
couples danced much closer than 
the frantic waltzes of the past cen-
tury. The improvi~d parts of the 
Charleston, danced in the '20s, 
and the Lindey, danced in the 
'30s, allowed for both dancers to 
express themselves. 

Ballroom dance also reflects 
Afro-American influences on 
American social dance and music. 
Almost all of the popular dances 
that have emerged in the U.S, 
since the beginning of the century 
are directly influenced by jazz 
rhythms. The fox trot, the most 
enduring smooth dance next to 
the waltz, originated from the 
combination of a traditional march 
step and the syncopated rhythms 
of ragtime. Imported dances like 
the tango, the mambo and the cha-
cha-cha reflect the Afro-American 
influences in latin american coun-
tries. 

For more information on the 
Ballroom Dan e Club at UCSD 
call Lori Valles 488-7539. The 
next meeting is May 30 at the 
Price Club Ballroom.
