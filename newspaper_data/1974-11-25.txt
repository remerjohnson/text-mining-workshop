Wilson Sees No 'Confidence,Competence' 
by M ark Stadler 

San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson 
claimed rriday that lack of 
"confidence" and " competence" 
in government are the most 
important factors in the 
credibility crisis today. Wilson 

Pete Wilson 

made his remarks in a speech in 
th R velie plaza . 

Wil on- said people are at " a 
low point In term of confidence" 
In government He declared that 
dl)closure laws' and other 

(ampal~n reforms hould help 
I('~tore that lost onfidence. 

But competence in government 
I th greater problem, Wil on 
as erted 

"Not Good Enough" 
" Intelligent men and women in 

both parties have ome to the 
realization that re ources are not 

unlimited, " Wilson said . Con-
tinuing in that vein, he charged 

that "som good legislative 
programs are not quite good 
enough" to warrant continued 
funding . ' 

All current programs then must 
be prioritized In order of need, 
the Mayor stated . The govern-
ment "must be ruthless" in 
deciding which programs are to 
be kept . 

Wi Ison charged that legislators 
may not be able to rank these 
programs objectively, because 
"politic do intervene, pride of 
authorship" in programs does 
interfere . "Time has passed when 
we can afford that," he said . 

-Wilson tated that "honest and 
objective analysis" must be used 
to rank program , instead of the 
flat stat em nts and conclusions 
that legislators use currently. 

Excesses 
Wil on blamed the recent 

Republican election fiasco on the 
" excesses of a few individual 
officeholders ." But, he said; " The 

Poetry Journal 

Republican Patty must ask itself 
what i meant" when a Gallup 
Poll taken just before the election 
showed that 51 per cent of 
Americans considered themselves 
conservative and then voted 
overwhelmingly Democratic . 

Wilson said that the political 
" excesses" will bring about 
reforms. He added that he "thinks 
Proposition Nine ... achieved some 
of the most needed reforms" in 
our society. 

Wilson is both optimistic and 
pessimistic about the end results 
of the recent scandals. He is 
optimistiC because " the Am rican 
people are remarkably resilient. " 
Th y will bounce back , but only if 

government IS opened up, he 
added . 

Wilson ' s pessimism results 
from a fear that Americans will 
"fa ll victim to demagogues" of 
reform . He is also apprehensivp 
about the two-party system, 
fearing that too many third 

'Helicon' Appears Today 
Helicon , a journal of poetry by UCSD community writers , will go on 

sal today on ampus . 
The Journal, which fills a long-felt void at UCSD, will contain about 

25 poem , selected from the more than 300 submi sions received by 
the editors. 

Helicon will ell for 25 cents. 
Funding 

According to Suzanne Hanse, organizer of Helicon, the problem in 
publishing the journal was not in getting submission, but in finding 
money. Today's edition was funded in part by the Communications 
Board and in part by monies from several academic departm nts . 

Poem ubmitted were read by all five members of the journal 's staff 
at least once. The editors emphasize that ea h poem was judged on its 
individual merits . 

Poem submitted In foreign languages were translated by readers 
proficient In the language.

parties would "cause such a 
diffusion of power" that it would 
be virtually impossible to run the 
government. 

" A two-party system ... provldes 
a broad spectrum of leadership" 
Wil on said, with the resulting 
competition drawing both parties 
to the center, " where the 
solutions are." 

Cheaper Oil 
Af er his remarks , Wilson 

invited questions from the 
audience. In response to a query 
concerning off-shore oil drilling, 
Wilson said " For years I have 
been opposed to off-shore oil 
drilling." But, he added, " I cannot 
Just lightly dismiSS the chance 
"for cheaper oil tnat ould result 
from the off-shore drilling . 

A qu stion was raised about a 
Civilian review board to mOnitor 
police actlvitle . Wilson aid he 
thought "we already had one in 
terms of the ci ty council . and 
that' s a responsibility that 
shouldn't be abdicated to anyone 
el e " 

On CIA Intervention In Chile, 
Wilson tated he thought 
America had no right to over-
throw a democratically elected 
governm nt because It was 
unfnendly to the United States 

There were many questions on 
a broad spectrum of topics; 
Wil on handled them coolly, 
almost arrogantly. The Mayor 
also showed a ense of humor, 
when in reply to a question about 
his speculated candidacy for the 
enate in 1976 he said, with 

straight face, "That's a very in-
teresting question I' ll think about 
it. "

Mid-January 
Chittick said It would be best to 

have results from the referendum 
by mid-January. It has not yet 
been determined whether the

Realists vs. Crazies 
Herbert chiller, professor ot 

Communi ations at UCSD, aid 
there are two ways of looking at 
economi problem . The first 
way, according to Schiller, is to 
view the problem as " realists" 
He said the reali ts are the bulk 
of our leader today who blam 
America's problems on people 
like the Arabs . 

He ontinued by aying that 
the Black , Chicanos, and other 
oppressed peoples have b en 
considered to be the " Arabs" by 
the realists . 

Schiller contra ted thi view 
With that of what he called 
"rr:vie ," whom he said are a 

~mall group of economiSts,

Housing Bite 
I am sure I was not the only one perplexed by thl:: 

T .T.'s Nov , 15 story on increased rent Like many 
other students, WP waited for over a year to get into 
Mesa Married Student Apartments so that we could 
afford a few luxuries (i.e. eating), To our dismay 
rent was Increased six dollars per month over last 
year This is understandable due to the increase 
cost of maintanence, But now it is to be raised 
almost forty dollars per month!! Is this how to fight 
inflation? The Mesa Residents don't eat cafeteria 
food, yet they are charged for the increased cost. Is 
thiS fair? 

What will happen if enrollment doe not In rease 
as projected or demand for on campus housing 
decreases (which it will if prices continue to 
skyrocket)? There will be millions of dollars worth 
of mortgages to be paid but not enough people to 
pay It. However I suppose you can always have the 
married ~tudents subsidize the dorms, 

Why IS it that the University (which does not pay 
property tax) can not compete with pr ivate cor-
porations (which pay through the no e)? If the 
University can no longer compete it is time they get 
out of the housing business. 

May I please make a few suggestions, 1) Could 
the University get the zoning necessary for a trailer 
park? (Many students have or could cheapl~obtain 
trai lers or recreational vehicles), 2) UCSD has much 
more land than it will ever use due to the revision of 
the master plan , Could part of this land be sold 
and/or leased to finance new dorms? 3) Is It 
possible to finance the dorms by other methods? 
The upper administration at this institution is paid 
more than what an instructor receives, Why not ask 
them to take a cut in pay? Students (especially 
married students, who are independent of their 
parents and are usually without financial aid) are 
not able to carry the burden of paying for new 
housing, 

A POTENTIAL DROP-OUT 

Gays Unorganized 
It IS reassuring to see that the gay community is 

finally being recogniled as part of the UCSD larger 
community. Inde d, I am pleased that the Women's 
Center at this school 15 taki ng part in the ex-
ploration of the lesbian lifestyle, and is integrating 
thiS explorat,lon with the development of a longer 
lasting program for gay wom n, 

I am a gay male at thiS school I have been a gay 
male at this school for three years . There have been 
and are no channels of communication With other 
gay students at UCSD, Like most other students my 
age, I desire to have a rich and rewarding ex-
perience in both my academic and social pursuits, 
Needless to say, my development of a good liberal 
arts and sciences education is not academically 
hampered at UCSD. My socia l life is quite another 
story , Or rather. no story at all I am not prone to 
cruising the bathrooms in the Humanities library. 
nor do I find it rewarding to go down to Black's 
beach just to get a quick blow job. This is not my 
idea of "social life." it is not my idea of life at all. 

At other UC campuses, the gay community is 
well organized and provides both self-educational 
and social programs to allow gays to learn to un-
derstand themselves, This may seem like an 
enormous undertaking - but the first step is being 
allowed to meet and socialile with others outside 
of a totally sex-oriented atmosphere. Organized 
meetings of gays at UCSD would be a good start. It 
would be good for me. It would be good for the gay 
community . And it would make UCSD a more 
survivable school.

Hiram Walker's " Bonehead English, TV. and

to think the earth flat and rectangular for it to be 
le~s than Inane. He sneers at a young student who 
mi\u)es the phrase ad-lib Mr. Walker, it is very 
likely Ihat the Paul Winter Consort might ad-lib, 
that I" " Improvised" I find it hard to credit that 
they (ould ad hoc anything because ad-hoc means 
"for this (I)urpose)." 

U~ually I do not pick articles apart for errors But 
Walker committed three hOrrid and unscholarly 
sins. 

I irst, although one's achievement test'in [ngl ish 
CompOSition earned a low score, It do s not mean 
that one does not know how to write. Certainly the 
low scorers are not taking a comp course " to rE'ctify 
congenital defects in their writing processes," 
Walker states that the ,nilbility to write stems from 
watching too much TV . I s one born already having 
watched television? Moreover, the test on ly 
evaluates how much formal grammar and diction 
the student know , It IS not a measure of writing 
skill. Students in Lit. 10 at UCSD are made to suffer 
by Walker and others who consider them 
"boneheads." My Lit. 10 students are sharp and 
sensitive. Most of them write better, and more 
kindly, than Walker . 

Second, Walker diQ not bother to write carefully 
He did not consult the dictionary (or any student in 
hi vicinity, even a bonehead) to confirm his 
argument about ad-libbed .1\ oppossed to ad hoc , 

And third, Walker's snobbishness and sloppiness. 
obscured and weakened his point. Television, like 
most things. can be beneficial or detrimental. 
Television viewing, at the expense of reading, can 
be a tradegy. A person, like Walker, can be trapped 
in a cage of unexpressiveness if he has ideas to 
promote but no poise in which to promote them 
correctly . 

we. SUTTER FORD ' 

Comm. Students 
Communications has matured as a program but 

lacks the support of the academic community 
nece sary to develop it into a department , Having 
the status of a program as opposed to the status of a 
department means to an a ademlc unit such as the 
CommUnications program that It will have a weak 
position In the campus competition for the limited 
resou rces avai lable. I t wi II not be able to have 
complete control over hiring of ils own faculty, for 
instance Consequently, the program I not as 
plestlgous as other a ademlc Units (department l. 
due to undernourl hment Thl) fact has been u~ed 
as a reason why the Communications program 
should not be made a department The Com -
munications program is caught In an Institutional 
VICIOUS Circle, in much the same way as the Urban 
and Rural Studl s, Third World Stuoies and Science 
and Technology programs _ 

I he circle game has become obvious ; If Com-
munications continues to encounter no suppOrt for 
whatever reason from other departments to 
develop its cu rriculum it ·.'Vi ll not gain the status to 
become a department itself . 

Many attempts have been made by past coor-
dinators Mike Real. John Waterhouse and Herb 
Schiller to make the appropriate changes to 
develop Communications, As a result of the op-
position in the form of non-cooperation, the 
coordinators have become justifiably frustrated and 
no longer wish the seeml\, token pOSition of 
Communications coordinator. As a result of their 
protest a Communications Advisory Committee has 
been appointed by Vice Chancellor-Academic 
Affairs, Paul Saltman. The members of this com-
mittee are Chairman, Dean of Graduate Studies, 
Professor M. Rotenberg, tenured professor of 
Sociology, Berger, Chairman of Sociolpgy. Cicourel, 
tenured professor of Visual arts, Kaprow, Chairman 
of Visual Arts, Harrison, and tenured professor of 
Communications, Schiller. 

The irony of these appointments is that with the 
exceptions of Rotenberg and Schiller (the only 
representative of Communications on the Com-
munications Advisor,y Committee) they are 
members of those departments who would not offer 
their cooperation to aid the Communications 
struggle. But as administrators of Communications 
they can influence the growth of interdisciplinary 
fields as well as the courses of the Commun ications 
program itself as they see fit. Not only will the 

triton times 

Advisory Committee control the power of 
curricu lum but is mandated to control funds usage, 
faculty appointmpnt~ and mprit incrpases, and 
teaching assistant allocations, in essen e, to 
cont rol the Communications program , 

In light of all that has been said, Com-
munications majors may expect a change in the 
program, maybp not to their liking but to the liking 
of the Advisory Committee , The Communications 
Student Union tC.S .U,) has a two-fold purpose: to 
explain in detail known to its members the situation 
of the program, and to articulate the opinions and 
reasoning of its members to the faculty and to those 
committees in charge of the program. A meeting of 
the C.S .U will be held Monday evening, 6 :30 in the 
Communications ConferE'nce Room The Invitation 
is ex tended to all Communications Majors, to all 
Third College program majors to offer their ex-
perien e and knowledge of imilar situations they 
find their program in , to younger members 
espe<..ially to perpetuate tudent motivation, and to 
all Third College faculty ,

Dopey Drug Report 
Once again, the Triton Times has provided 

unequivocal evidence that Rhesus monkeys can 
and do mimic that highly complex, human 
behaVioral pattern known as journalism (Oh Rex 
Pickett, where are you now that we need you?) . In 
the front page story, "Muir Student Takes Bad 
Acid; Traced Off-Campus" (11/18), James Soto 
reports, " An unidentified Muir student suffered a 
serious psychotic breakdown from what was 
probably tainted LOS," 

It constantly amazes me how so much 
ignorance can be concentrated into so small a 
geographical locale (the college campus) . Even an 
average Rhesus monkey, not even fully grown, 
should be able to realize that LSD, regardless of Its 
purity, and in spite of what dangerous and mind-
boggl ing effects it mayor m.ay not have, does not 
cause mental illness. Admittedly, LSD, acting like 
a cata lyst, can precipitate or bring to the surface a 
mental condi tion that preexists the ingestion of 
the ubstance. But to say that LSD cause mental 
illness , is a gross distortion of the truly meager 
knowledge we have about the halluci nogeni 

~ubstances, as any even cu r.sory exami nation of 
last week's situation with the unfortunate, 
unld ntified Muir student would havp rpvealpd, 

Soto reminds me of some of my smug and 
hopelessly sophisti cated peers who would watch 
the fi lm, " Reefer Madness," laugh at its distorted 
and outrageous portrayal of marijuana, and still 
come out filled with profound ignorance about the 
drug scene, i.e., specifically as it relates to such 
matters as LSD. RE'x, the lobotomy is com-
plete ... "put the horses in the wagon, it's all down 
hill from here ,"

"Poor Journalism" 
As members of Temple Beth Israel, A Reform 

'temple which serves the San Diego Community, 
we would like to object to the poor lournalism 
exhibited by Valery Girard in the drticie on the 
Jewish Community of La Jolla Sunday School. 
(Triton Times, Nov, 18) In the article, and em-
phasized in heavy type on the front page, was the 
following statement. "There are no synago~lIes in 
the area, so, in a sense, the school and th~ 
organization provide the only cultural education 
for Jews in the area." A quick glance at the yellow 
pages of the phone directory reveals no less than 
eight other synagogues and,4>r centers, all of 
which maintain active educational programs for 
both children and adults, One is right here in La 
Jolla, another is closeby in Claremont, and several 
others are easily accessible to La Jolla residents, 
Without ignoring the contributions of the Jewish 
Community of La Jolla, we feel it is necessary to 
point out the variety of organizations available to 
Jews seeking education about their heritage, We 
hope that this will serve as a reminder to Triton 
Times writers that accuracy is an essential aspect 
of reporting,

One guy would tllP his fingers on the 
desk. A slow, steady bellt. And just when I 
had become used to it, he varied the rhvth-
m. I don't know how he knew the very 
moment to change it, but he knew. He 
must have. 
worry me, He told me he had had 
to cancel a date that week in 
order to study , He had earlier 
made a statement that the devil 
himself couldn't keep him from 
making the date, so I had good 
reason to suspect things looked 
bad . 

"I had watched about two 
hours of television the previous 
evening, but after speaking to 
Jim, my smart friend, I felt guilty 
and made a firm pledge to begin 
studying Soon , 

" Did you ever see a program 
ca ll ed 'Run for Your Life?' That 
was me. I had it all in my head , It 
was like, uh, 'Mike Arden , age 22. 
A young man on the threshold of 
success. A bright student with a 
good future in front of him . Then, 
on a routine visit to his adVisor, 
he hears the news. It is only two 
weeks until finals and now he 
must compress nine weeks of 
study into one week-maybe two.' 

" The party was over and I had a 
two week hangover in store for 
me. I, too, canceled every activity 
I had planned and made it clear 
to everyone I knew that Mikey 
was going to study until his pants 
fused to his butt , 

" It was sometimes harder, 
though, to implement the 
decision once it was made. All my 
tests were on The Curve , What 
that boils down to is that I wasn't 
tryi ng to beat the professor or thf' 
book , It meant all of us students 
were pitted against each other , It '

in the library. Very subtle, you 
know, but evil. 
"Like what? Oh, a thousand little 
things .. , This guy often sat at the 
same table I did during the day. I 
had gotten pr~ttv used to his 
cigarettes when he switched to 
another brand. This stuff smelled 
like a forest fire , Of course, there 
was the age-old trick of asking for 
help on a certain problem. The 
helper would waste his time, but 
the other guy would benefit, you 
know, 

"But that was early on , Things 
got more subtle, though they still 
didn't fool me , I knew their game, 
and I played it, too. One guy 
would tap his fingers on the desk, 
almost inaudibly. A slow steady 
beat. And just when I had 
become used to it, he varied the 
rhythm . I don't know how he 
knew the very moment to change 
it. but he knew, He must have,

Contact Inhibition will meet What an Ice Chest for the championship of the coed in-

tramural football leagues. Contact gained the finals by exposing Smut 22-7, while What an 
Ice Chest slipped past the punks 14-12 to capture the other final berth. 

The Smut-Contact game was closer than the score indicated. As late as the middle of the 
second half Smut was in position to pull off an upset . Trailing only 14-\) they had the ball 
in Contact territory, but were unable to score. . 

The game looked as if it was going to be a rout at the outset as Contact rolled to a qUick 
14-0 halftime lead . 

Laurie Gage scored the first touchdown on a long pass from Skip Jones . The conversion 
pass from laurie Davis to Dave Friedman made the score 8-0. 

Contact came right back and scored again, this time on a Davis to Jones pass of four 
yards. The extra point try was no good, leaving the score 1W at the halt . 

Smut struck quickly in the second half. Gordie Akers scored on a fifty yard pass and run 
play from lisa Carpenter to narrow the score to 14-6. It might be said that Laurie Davis 
nearly knocked the in her attem to cover the swift Akers. 

Contact Inhibition 
After Smut blew its las t chan'ce to stay in the game. Contact was able to score on the 

Demora l ized Smut defense. The TO came on a we ll executed flea fl i ker from Skip Jones 
to Debbie Kar and back to Jones . 

The game ended 22-6 wi th Smut pull ing their shift defense on Contact for the last play 
of the game. Smut merely shifted off the fie ld to the amazement of bystanders, Inhibitors 
and referees alike. Good show, Ron ! 

Saturday What an Ice Chest staved off a second half rally by Dickie Duncan's Pu nks (not 
to be confused With his men's team of the same name) . After build ing .up a 14-{) halftime 
lead , What an Ice Chest saw the lead evapo rate as Duncan uti lized the flea f l icker to it's 
ultimate potential 

What an Ice Chest tall ied twice In the fi rst half on long Tou chdown passes over a 
confused Punk defense . Nancy Actin and Ji ll Duder both got beh ind the Punk secondary

to haul in long bombs from quarterback Keith Bryan. What an Ice Chest con\'~rt ed the 
extra po int after the fi rst TO on a pass from Bryan to Souder. Thi s PA 1 was to make the 
difference in the final outcome. 

The Punks opened the second half with t he flea flicker, Dickie Duncan sty le. Duncan 
passed to Amm lia, who immedia tely flipped the ball back to Dunca n. Needless to say 
Duncan was long gone. 

With the score 14-6, the Punks struck aga in. Duncan hit Val Cordiero, who expectin g 
someone to take the fl ea fl ick stood around ye lling, " Who's coming? Who's coming!" 
Duncan finally decided he had better. The result was a forty yard flea flicked touchdown . 
Unfortunately for the Punks th ey could not convert e ither of their ex tra points and their 
hopes for victory di d when What an Ice Chest ran out the last four minutes of the game.

Love That Voice 
"l'aime la vOix humanie," frequently uttered nancis Poulenc, 

noted contemporary French composer. The brilliant songs to be 
performed by the UCSD Concert Choir honoring the composer's 75th 
anniversary bear out this love for the human voice. 

The program will be presented at 8 o'clock, tomorrow, in room 210 
of the lower regions ot the Mandevi"e Center, new horne of the arts 
at UCSD. ' 

Poulenc , an influential figure in contemporary music, was at his 
most inspired when writing concert songs. As a child he devoured the 
poetry of contemporary writers. Many of his songs are set to the 
poetry of surrealists, Guillaume Apo"inaire and Paul Eluard, 
represented by "Banalites, " "Un Soir de Beige," and "Tel Jour te"e 
Nuit" on Tuesday's program. 

Drawing inspiration from a variety of sources found in every day 
life Poulenc subordinated his inventiveness to the form which he sel~cted as the most properly suited to the chosen subject. His ideal 
form, which he treats with enviable sureness is the motet: "Quatre 
Motets .pour Ie temps de'Noel" wi" be sung by the Concert Choir. 
Other works to be performed include songs trom Quatre Petites 
Prieres de St. Francois d' Assise, with the Men's Choir; songs from 
Petites Voix, with the Women's Choir; Chansons francaises and 
"Sanctus" with the entire Choir. 

The UCSDConcert Choir consists of 70 singers, divided into dif-
ferent sections for greater variety by John Large, director.

Good Time With Stevie Wonder 
It's been almost three years since I last at-

tended a concert at the Sports Arena, and I 
remember swearing that I would never see 
another concert there again. The poor acoustics, 
the rowdy people, and the distance between 
audience and performer makes an evening of 
music there fairly disappointing, unless you are 
too stoned to care, which for most Sports Arena 
fans is usually the case. , 

I changed my mind when I heard rumor that 
Stevie Wonder was to be in town, and sure 
enough, last Thursday night I found myself 
sitting in the grandstands of that huge hockey 
rink, surrounded by a haze of smoke so thick 
that it began to sting my eyes. 

The warm-up act only cooled down the 
anxiously awaiting Wonder fams. "Rufus," a 
motown-boogey band, led by the strong, sexy 
vocals of Chaka Kahn were sloppy and out of it. 
The Hockey Palace only added to the confusion, 
and I was mad that I hadn't abided by my oath 
and stayed away from the Sports Arena. 

I! was disapPOinting not to hear those smooth, 
gliding harmonies that made their hit single, 
"Tell Me Something Good," one of my favorites. 
I:verything in their act eemed just a bit awk-
ward so that at the end of a short 35 minute set, 
I cduldn't tell whether the audience was 
clapping because they appreciated the effort, or 
whether they w re just anxious to get on with 
the show. 

At the intermission, I walked attentively 
I around the huge arena, feeling a bit un-

derdressed compared to the sleek, velvet and 
lace covered ladies on parade around me. The 
outfits on display almost made up for the let-
down Rufus gave me, but I was anxious for 
Stevie to begin his act. I returned to my seat 
from which I cou ld hardly distinguish objects on 
stage. I was so close to the roof and the Olympia 
beer signs that I didn't want to look down. 

I was still thinking about the ugly building 
when the lights dimmed, the crowd freaked, and 
Stevie Wonder's band, Wonderlove appeared. 
They did a fairly traditional Motown set, ana-the 
audience, including myself, appreciated their 
grace and sty le. Michael Sombelio, ex-Santana, 
along with the three very lovely ladies who 
composed the back-up vocals, effectively 
prepared us for Stevie. 

Unfortunately, the promoters, or Arena 
managers, or someone, seemed extremely 
nervous about the amount of people enjoying 
themselves in the aisles around the arena. 
Consequently , a twitchy man with a mike came 
on stage and informer! everyone that unless they 

found themselves a seat, the show would not go 
on . It brought back painful memories of grade-
school. 

The audience cooperated quickly, again the 
lights were dimmed, and the arena suddenly 
seemed different; I said to myself, "I shoulda 
known ." It sounded just fine now; the Sports 
Arena was just another place to listen to Stevie 
Wonder . Stevie has the unique ability of 
surrounding himself with a mood of creativity , 
and free-flowing melody. 

Dressed in a brown, glittered suit, and ac-
companying himself with sways and bobs and 
little dances he produced a gentle beauty that 
makes Stevi~ the wonder that he is. 

Beginning with " Higher Ground,"'a song with 
defi nite, rhythm and force, ana following it with 
"Pure Love," a tune both melodi c and quiet, that 
persuaded you to hum along, one became aware 
of Mr. Wonder's ability to tighten up and mellow 
nown with ease and artistry . 

" I' ll give you as much love as I can," Stevie 
crooned to an audience of more than 14,000, 
and everyone responded with the warmth and 
friendliness that can bring such a large group 
to!1ether. He then began a set that I it the 
audience into a fire of delight. 

After a synthesizer solo, Stevie got confidently 
to his feet, wielding his harmonica with one arm, 
and embracing his back-up vocalists with the 
other . He then managed a dancin'-jivin' 
collection of harmonica tunes that brought the 
audience to their feet with uncontrollable joy. 
"Made To Love," a Wonder masterpiece, seemed 
to make everyone a little giddy with a nostalgiC, 
penetrating quality. 

A funny thing happened then, with Won-
derlove gathered around his acoustic piano, 
Stevie began playing "Earth Angel ," a sound so 
white that it seemed out of place. But Stevie had 
the audience in his magic fingers, and no one 
really seemed to care what he played. 

I cou ldn't help myself then, I had to get down 
on the floor and join the dancing. The remainder 
of the show consisted of such greats as " Don't 
You Worry 'Bout A Thing, " "The City, " "You Are 
The Sunshine of My Life," and "Superstition," all 
resiliant and vibrant. Everyone was jumping and 
clapping, and no one minded being under the 
musical spell of this genius, Stevie Wonder. , 

At midnite, the show closed with mutual 
thank-you's and farewells . No encore, no shouts 
for more; we had had our fill and were happy. 
I've decided that I still don't like the Sports 
Arena, but how can you not have a good time if 
you're with Stevie Wonder? 

You don't blow an extraordinary idea 
on an ordinary shoe. 

By nOUJyou're probably

they're made, but how 
well . Only the finest grade 
Canadian hides are 
selected . These are hand-
crafted into Roots, simply 
because. for much of our 
prodUction , the most 
efficient machine is still the 
human hand. 
This is why, of all the 
reasons we could give you 
for trying Roots, none 
would fit quite so well dS the 
shoe itself.

the four-oh , I was eloquent I I left 
nothing u nexpla i ned-all was 
clear. Within four hours, all was 
done I rose from my seat and put 
my booklets In the box and left 
the room . 

"Somewhere between the room 
and my car, it hit me. I had 
neglected to sign my name to the 
testl 

"Fool! I ran back to the room 
and excitedly told the proctor my 
si tuation . She agreed to get my 
books out of the box ." 

"After I pulled them out , I 
knee leg before the desk and 
reached for my pen when yet 
another thing occurred ... 1 

couldn 't remember my name. 
" I sagged against the desk 

What could I do? I wanted to cry 
but.. .my wallet. I nside was my 
driver'S license and ID card ." 

" !:lut the goddamned things 
were blank!" 'What iniquity is 
thiS?' I cried in pain . I looked 
around and out of the sea of 
staring faces I found my TA. I ran 
to him and grabbed his shoulders. 
' In the name of God, man, what is 
my name?' I shouted. 

" He looked at me oddly, then 
made to speak . But no! -he 
mocked mel His lips moved but 
he didn't make a sound . It was he! 
He somehow got my wallet . He 
erased my name from every piece 
of paper it was on .

" I Wd~ rUll1l:!tl. I madly ran from 
the room . I was insane with 
despair. Blindly I ran, pushing 
everyone from my path till I hit 
something that wouldn't move." 

Arden shifted in his seat. " I 
woke up here, doctor." 

I sensed he was finished, so I 
turned from him to swit h off the 
tape machine . When I turned 
back to him, he had removed his 
shirt. 

" But, you know doc?" he said 
thinly "There's nothing to keep 
me here anymore. I remember my 
name and I'll never forget it " He 
broke into a smile. " I've got a 
system," he said, reaching to his 
abdomen and removing the scabs 
from the last two letters in his 
name.

information about possible 
candidates, to make them better 
known to the Regents. 

The other way is through the 
UC President's Council , whom 
Regents have asked to recom-
mend candidates for the position . 

Also' at the meeting, Fanberg 
then brought up various local 
prOjects for the UCSD annex. One 
that has been neglected thus far is 
the " legislator to ampus" 
program, where the annex brings 
pol iticians to its ampus to speak 

So far the only p05slble 
" legislator to campus" IS former 
New York Congres man AI 
Lowenstein . 

On e project sugge sted by 
Lobby directors is for each annex 
to "scope" the power stru cture at 
its campus, then put out a 
directory explaining the. structure 
Lobby members could then u e 
the directory as a guide In the rest 
of the year. 

These and other projects will 
be discussed in greater detail at 
the regional conference of 
Southern California annex 
directors meeting January 17 at 
Lo Angeles .
