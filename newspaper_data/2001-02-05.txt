Change in Code 
Pushes Lawyers 
Out of Hearings 
Students can no longer have 
attornies at campus hearings 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Revisions to the Student Code of Conduct. 
eliminating a student 's right to attorney repre-
sentation during hearings of misconduct. took 
effect fall quarter. 

The right to have attorney representa tion at 
hearings has been a student right at .UCSD 
since 1978, when the first draft of the Student 
Code of Conduct was created. 

Nick Aguilar, the director of student policies 
and judicial affairs. said that students have not 
lost a right because they never had a constitu-
tional right to representation by attorneys. 

"There is no constitutional right to be rep-
resented by an attorney in administrative hear-
ings: Aguilar said. "The right to attorney 
relates to the constitutional right of a criminal 
defendant to be represented by an attorney 
while administrative hearings are based on civil 
law, not crimina l law." 

Aguilar said the goal of eliminating attor-
neys from the hearing process is to prevcnt 
hearings from being thrust into more formal 
civil law proceedings. 

"My experience when attorneys represent 
students lis that] hearings tend to become for-
malistic and cumbersome with no noticeable 
advantage to students: Aguilar stated. 

Tony Valladolid, the director of student 
legal services, said he does not believe the 
change will compromise a student 's rights.

Academic Senate Updates Requirements, Grad Programs 
New bioinformatics degree created, course requirements for Roosevelt college relaxed 
., IIEIICCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

Members of the Representative 
Assembly met Tuesday at the 
Academic Senate meeting and 
were updated on the status of the 
Next Generation Network Plan. 

The assembly voted in favor of 
establishing three new programs 
of graduate study and revising the 
academic requirements for 
Roosevelt and Revelle colleges. 

The Next Generation Network, 
which is the new telecommunica-
tion plan for UCSD, will be imple-
mented on July 1, 2001 . The new 
plan will merge voice, data and 
Internet to make intracampus 
connections faster. 

Real-time video, audio, high-
volume transfers and other high -
end dpabilities will become easy-
to-obtain services. The Next 
Generation Network will result in 
an overall net reduction in the 
telecommunication bill for the 
university. 

As a result of the plan, long-
distance phone charges areexpcct-

ed to drop approximately 40 per-
cent, according to Associate Vice 
Chancellor David Miller, who 
spoke about the new plan. 

There will be a $60 monthly 
communication user fee for some 
campus employees. 

The total cost for the Next 
Generation Network is approxi: 
mately $10 million per year, which 
includes equipment, staffing, sup-
plies and connectivity charges to 
the external service providers. The 
communication user charges are 
estimated to provide $6.5 million; 
the deficit will be subsidized by 
campus-wide state funds. 

Campus committees will pro-
vide oversight and monitoring to 
assure quality of service and cost 
control. and during the third year 
of assessment of the new tech-
nologies. they will establish the 
next year's Next Generation 
Network networking plans. 

The assembly also voted in favor 
of a proposal to establish a program 
of graduate studies in bioinformat-
ics for the Ph.D. degree. 

The new Ph.D. program will 

provide research and an education 
structu re dedicated to the develop-
ment of sophisticated computer-
based handling tools used for 
understanding the integrated 
functions of thousands of genes in 
the post-genome sequencing era. 

[n addition, the assembly voted 
in favor of the proposal to estab-
lish a program of graduate study 
leading to masters of education 
degree. The program was submit-
ted by the Teacher Education 
Program at UCSD and will further 
articulate the existing credential 
programs at the university. 

The M.Ed. will be an intensive 
15-month professional degree 
designed specifically to help ele-
mentary and secondary teachers 
earning their initial teaching cre-
dential at UCSD. The program wi ll 
allow students to earn their teach-
ing credential and M.Ed. degree 
before entering the teaching pro-
fession . The new program was 
developed in response to the 
demand for well-prepared teachers 
in California. 

The program for graduate 

studies in art history, theory and 
criticism for the Ph .D. and M.A. 
degrees. which will be established 
by the department of visual arts, 
was the third proposal the assem-
bly voted in favor of. 

Modifications to the Roosevelt 
college general education require-
ments for entering freshmen were 
voted on. The assembly voted in 
favor of amending Regulation 625. 
The changes were proposed to 
enhance curricular flexibility for 
students by increasing the applica-
bility of some advanced placement 
credits toward college requirements, 
providing scheduling room for elec-
tives and shortening time to degree 
for students with highly structured 
majors. The modifications also seek 
to improve the distribution of 
undergraduate student enrollment 
across the colleges by increasing the 
alignment of ERC's requirements 
with those of other colleges. 

The proposed changes include 
changes to the foreign language, fine 
arts and natural sciences require-
ments. For specific course informa-
tion, see ERC academic advising.

Lawyers: 
UCSD has a system of 
informal hearings 
Continued from ..... 1 
Valladolid said. "And if a student elects 
to have an attorney present during ~"e 
hearing for advice, he or she can: 

Valladolid said that attorneys are 
generally unfamiliar with the process 
and administration of the Student 
Conduct Code. 

"It's the tendencies of attorneys to 
corne in and apply the very rigid ru le 
of law from their experience wi th 
crimina l justice system," Valladolid 
said. "Consequently, attorneys tend to 
be ineffective in the administrative set-
ting." 

Valladolid said that the way the 
Student Conduct Code was revised 
was fair. 

"There was a fair airing of the issue 
between students and faculty before it 
was voted upon: Valladolid said. 

The revisions were handled by the 
Student Regulations Revision 
Committee, which is composed of 
administrators, staff, deans, graduate 
students, one student from every col-
lege and two representatives appoint-
ed by A.S. Council. 

According to the revised Student 
Conduct Code 22.17.16.13, students 
no longer have the right to have attor-
ney representation at hearings of mis-
conduct. At hearings students may be 
accompanied by a non-attorney advi-
sor. The accl,lsed student may also 
have an attorney present at the hear-
ing to serve as a resl"urce. 

Warren Junior Erik Smith, one of 
the members of the Student 
Regulations Revision Committee, said 
elimination of attorney representation ' 
at a student hearing is related to the 
intent of the hearing. 

"The hearing board is made entire-
ly of students and is for a student; it is 
not meant to be as formal as an actual 
court hearing; Smith said. "Thus, 
bringing in a lawyer for student repre-
sentation complicates the matter in 
that it would raise the hearing to a 
more formal level than was intended." 

Smith said that he does not believe 
students will be harmed by the change 
because there is the option of having a 
student advocate represent them at 
the hcaring. 

"The student advocates do an 
excellent job of defending students. 
and because their service is available, I 
feci that students do not lose from not 
being able to have an actual attorney 
represent them; Smith said. "It could 
even be argued that the student advo-
ca tes could do a better job than an 
attorney since they can relate with 
their fellow students and imnlediately 
understand the circumstances sur-
rounding a student's case." 

Smith said UCSO 's system of 
informal hearings gives an advantage 
to the students. 

"The chance to have a group of 
peers judge your case should make a 
student feel safe from being wrongful-
ly accused of something: Smith said. 

Johan Hill. a member of the A.S. 
revisions committee, said he would 
have protested the change if he had 
still been on the committee, but lost 
his position before the revision was 
proposed. 

"I never would have voted for it, 
because it isn't in the best interests of 
students." Hill said. " If I was there, I 
would have spoken against it." 

Hill raised the concern of low stu-
dent attendance to the meetings as 
possibly affecting the unanimous pas-
sage of the revisions. 

"You'd have great faculty and 
admil1lstrators attendance and then 
have two or three of the students show 
up for the meetings," Hill said . "So not 
enough students were there to protect 
righ ts of students." 

Hill also qut'Stioned why he was the 
only student appointed by the A.S. 
Council to the committee when there 
were two vacancies. Hill said he is very 
concerned that his position was not 
filled after he left the committee. 

"I am cohcerned because with two 
less students, combined with low stu-
dent attendance, there were more 
administrators there, thus more 
votes: Hill said.

Golfer Casey Martin deserves the opportunity to 
perfonn with other athletes, regardless of his disability 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Supreme Court has the duty to allow Casey Martin the right to use 
a cart in golf tournaments so that there will be an end to the exclusion and 
discrimination of the disabled. 

The controversy surrounding Martin 's landmark case is whether the Pro-
fessional Golfers' Association Tour has the right to exclude golfers with dis-
abilities, or is required by law to make some reasonable accommodations. At 
stake is the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, which banned discrimina-
tion against the disabled in public accommodations, including golf courses 
and entertainment sites. The law requires "reasonable modifications' for dis-
abled people unless such changes would fundamentally alter the nature of 
the place or event. 

Martin is unable to walk the entire length of the tournament's course due 
to an incurable circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes walking 
painful and potentially dangerous to his health. In 1997, Martin sued the 
PGA Tour for not complying with the ADA, which gives him a right to use a 
cart during tour events. A federal district court in Oregon, along with a San 
Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, agreed 
that the golf cart merely gave Martin an equal chance to 
play, not an unfair advantage. Yet, the PGA Tour 
could not accept having the court dictate how 
its sport should be played, so it appealed to 
the Supreme Court. 

The PGA Tour argues that allowing 
Martin to use a cart gives him an unfair 
advantage over the other players, who 
must walk. It is obvious that Martin 
has an inherent disadvantage 
from the onset because he 
cannot walk the course with-
out injuring himself. There- . 
fore, the game only becomes 
fai r by allowing Martin to use a 
cart to get from hole to hole 
so that he has the chance 
to compete. Martin's right 
to use a cart is not an 
advantage, but a way to give 
him equal opportunities as 
the other competitors. 

The PGA Tour also argues that the people who run the sport are the ones 
who should make the rules: Either a golfer walks the entire green or cannot 
play. No exceptions, no accommodations. These rules leave the sport of pro-
fessional golf open exclusively to the able-bodied and closed to anyone with 
some sort of disability. Yet this arrogant attitude ignores the equality and 
inclusion principals of the ADA, and instead tries to supersede the PGA and 
any other sport above the law, subjecting the players to its arbitrary will. 

If the PGA Tour prevails in the Supreme Court, society will be split into 
the healthy and so-called able people, and the disabled and disease-ridden 
people who must accept their limitations and submit to the elimination 
of their civil rights. The argument that the disabled cannot compete with 
able-bodied eo Ie sets an ominous tone, the complete exclusion of the 

disabled from our society. We 

~ r 0 already have separate, special schools for some of the disabled. If Martin loses, there will be a complete separation of the dis-abled from mainstream sports. Next, society may segre-GlIARDlAN OPINION gate the disabled into specific jobs, separate from the rest. 
What 's next? Separate drink-
ing fountains or restaurants 

for the disabled? It's not so far-fetched, with a not-so-distant past of 
deeming African-Americans unequal under the law. 

If Martin loses, society is down the slippery slope, allowing all our 
rights to be compromised. Once the rights of one group in our soci-
ety are compromised, it is only a matter of time before someone takes 
aim at everybody's rights. Therefore, it is imperative that the Supreme 
Court rule in Martin's favor in order to maintain equal opportuni-
ty and protection for all under the law. Otherwise. we might 
as well throw out our Constitution, Bill of Rights and all 
of our federal laws as obsolete and utterly usel.ess. 

It is clear that all the PGA Tour wants to do is to 
protect its precious. elitist sport and its perfect image. 
What about the law? Isn't it supposed to protect the 
strong and weak alike without favoritism or discrimi-
nation? The PGA Tour asks Martin and other golfers to

Sports is not an equal-opportunifJ job. Casey Martin 
decided to play, so now he must play by the rules 

Senior Staff Writer 

Sports and the competition involved are unique things. The field of pro-
fessional sports, which is reserved for those performing at the pinnacle of the 
activity, is reserved for those who are the best. "The best" are those most 
physically capable to perform the required activities of tfie sport, based upon 
its rules. -

This is why golfer Casey Martin, who suffers from a disease that makes 
walking extmnely painful, should not be allowed to use a golf cart while 
playing professional golf. The Professional Golfers' Association has a rule 
banning the use of carts. To enable himself to play, Martin'must break that 
rule and use a cart on the course, while others comply with the rules. 

The PGA claims that he is breaking a sacred rule. Martin, on the other 
hand, says that the PGA is discriminating against the disabled. 

After one unsuccessful appeal, the PGA has again brought Mar-
tin to court over the ~ of the cart. The debate between his sup-

porters and those who side with the PGA has become so heat-
ed that the case has reached the highest court in the land, the 
u.s. Supreme Court. 

FlTSt off, I want to make clear that I do not discriminate 
against people with disabilities. They should have the same 
rights as anyone else. They should be able to shop, enjoy 
entertainment, hold jobs, etc. with as much ease as anyone 
else. 

Sports, on the other hand, are different. Sports are a 
competition among the best and the most capable. The 
best golfers play in the PGA. They have the highest 
skill level. This is because that they have the physical 
attributes to be so. -

The PGA has made its rules. They are clear. One of 
them is that you cannot Tide a cart while playing. [s it 
a fair rule? That does not matter. What does matter is 
that it is the PGA's rule. Is it meant to disoiminate? 
Not at all . That is not the intention of the rule. It 
makes golf that much more challenging, that much 
more of a sport, if you must walk from hole to hole. 

Many Martin supporters are comparing the PGA's 
stance on Martin to the stance on race a few decades 
ago. I do not believe that it is the same. Yes, profession-
al golf discriminated based on race. but that was clear-
ly wrong. No golf skill is affected because you are white, 
black, brown or even blue. What the PGA did then was 
wrong. It is different i'n Martin's case. He is physically 
unable to perform. 

[f Martin is allowed to use a cart to help him play 
golf, then where does it stop? Should they allow short 
people to use stilts while playing basketball? It's the 

same thing. It is faux elimination of a physical disability 
that is detrimental to a person's skill at a sport - in this 

instance, lack of height in basketball. [n football, should 
coaches start allowing suits of armor to rrotect skinny, non-
muscular guys? Of course not. Footbal has a rule thatJou 
must run with the ball. What about a cart? That woul be 
ridiculous. Football 
is reserved for those 
who can tough it 
out, and golf is for 
those who can do 
all of the physical 
performances 

required. 
How about those

who wish to play _ 
golf but do not have 
the necessary arm strength? They too, in a way, are being 

discriminated against, because golfers are often required to 
hit the baI[ 300 yards or more. Let's aI[ow them a .1 OO-yard 
head start to make up for their lack of physical ability. This is . 
the same as what we would be doing for Martin. 

Many argue that the senior tour allows the use of carts. so 
then why not the other professionals? Think about that for a 
second. Why are they on the senior tour? Because their 

physical skills have deteriorated with age. 
When the seniors' skills have deteriorated

the street from Center Hall, and a 
world-renowned international rela-
tions school with a fine arts gradu-
ate school in the plans. Down by La 
Jolla Shores is the Scripps Institu-
tion of Oceanography, one of the 
best marine biology schools in the 
nation. Then there is also the Jonas 
Salk Institute across the street from 
North Parking. 

Yet, comparing UCSD to other 
top-ranked UCs, mainly UC Berke-
ley and UCLA, something seems to 
be missing from the landscape. and 
no, I'm not referring to beautiful 
women. What UCSD needs is a 
business school and a law school 
and we need both for several rea-
sons. 

The main question that comes 
up is "Why doesn 't UCSD have 
schools in business and law?" I 
wish [ could answer this. The rea-
sons would certainly make this arti-
cle much more interesting. 

In my opinion, UCSD seems to 
be in a perennial, uphill fight to be a 
legitimate prestigious school. We 
always seem to be on the fringe, 
almost crossing that line, joining 
UCLA and Berkeley as top-notch 
UCs. But the lack of a business 
school and the lack of a law school 
are the two stones that are weighing 
us down. 

And please note that UCLA and 

Berkeley are not the only UC cam-
puses that offer these two schools. 
UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC River-
side all offer a business school, law 
school or a combination of both. If 
second-tier universities like UC 
Irvine or UC Riverside have these 
schools. why don't we? By offering a 
Masters of Business Administration 
degree or a Doctorate of Law 
degree, or preferably both, UCSD 
can make that final leap and join the 
top 10 schools in the nation. 

We are all aware that our cam-
pus is known for its great biology 
programs and the No. 3-ranked 
medical school in the nation. How-
ever, few know about the excellence 
of the fine arts here or the school of 
engineering. By having a business 
school that rivals UCLA's Anderson 
School of Business and a law school 
that rivals Berkeley's Boalt Hall, 
UCSD can be known for more than 
just spitting out doctors and 
researchers. 

Another reason for having a 
business school is how well it would 
complement the renowned eco-
nomics department here - and I'm 
not saying this just because I'm an 
economics major. Economics and 
management science are popular 
fields here, though about one-third

Just a friendly reminder: By the 
time you read this there will be less 
than two weeks between you and 
Valentine's Day. What are you going 
to do about it? 

A: Run out and begin a cheap 
and meaningless six-week fling to 
avoid being alone? 

B: Stock up on chocolates, ramen 
and down comforters so you can 
hide out for a good week before and 
after the dreaded day of love? 

C: Look into the wide world of 
personal escorts? 

D: Binge, purge, binge, purge, 
binge? 

Or, hopefully, 
E: None of the above? 
This is where I come in. 
Believe me, I know the pressure 

of Valentine's Day that hangs over 
the heads of those in and out of the 
blessed state of couplehood. No 
matter )Vho you are, the big V-Day 
brings a challenge. 

For those with someone to call 
"honey," it's like a final exam - arbi-
trary, hard to study for, a huge 
source of performance anxiety and 
an easy way to screw up something 

you know how to do right. 
For those living la vida sola, "el 

dra del gran corazon rojo" - for 
those of you experiencing espanol 
deficiency syndrome, that's "day of 
the big red heart," often brings a 
case of the blues instead of a vase of 
flowers. No matter which end of it 
comes at you with a pointy stick, this 
day dedicated to the uplifting power 
of love can easily become a 24-hour, 
all-you-can-eat sour grapes 
special. And, to quote the guy who 
paraphrased the bard, "that sucks." 

How do we avoid being one of 
"Ies miserables" - for those of you 
still struggling with francophobia, 
that's "frowny folks" - when fateful

the stationery suppliers do: Take

this current controversy that the law 
did not do nearly enough. 

However, the underlying reason 
why discrimination persists is not 
really the law, for the law is on the 
books and ready to be properly 
enforced. The problem lies in soci-
ety's view of what a disabled person 
can and ca nnot do, which hasn't 
changed much within the last 
decade. The Martin case is merely a 
reflection of society's attitudes as a 
whole toward disabled people. 
Only if the Supreme Court rules in 
favo r of Martin will the ADA final-
ly be given the ultimate power to 
stamp out discrimination against 
disabled people.

cart does not fundamentally alter the 
game of golf as his foes argue. 
I nstead, it physically forces a change 
in the consciousness of the people 
who make the rules in sports to be as 
inclusive and nondiscriminatory as 
possible. By protecting the disabled 
from discriminatory practices, we are 
not only reaffirming our Constitu-
tional truths of equal opportunity 
and protectioh under the law, also 
ensuring the preservation of the 
rights we hold dear. 

Thus, the only acceptable deci-
sion by the Supreme Court is that 
the use of a golf cart gives Martin 
an equal chance to compete, not an 
unfair advantage. Anything else 
would be a betrayal of our consti-
tutional ideals.

Valentine's Day is tough all

two majors because they couldn't

I'm sure the economics and 
management science majors can 
hardly believe it, but "U.S. News

Though economics and busi-

the three ' majors could be incor-

building of a business school, new

could be offered. Instead of a gen-
eral degree such as economics or 
the slightly more specified man-
agement science or business 
administration, degrees in 
accounting or operations manage-
ment could be offered. 

The same applies to a law

department, the political science

cannot. Not everyone should be 
able to get a free ride. 

I am not a Martin basher. Mar-
tin is a decent golfer and a fine 
individual. Unfortunately, because 
of some setbacks, he is unable to 
perform at the level that he wishes. 
That is too bad, and I feel for him. 
He has been dealt a poor hand in 
life. But rules for a recreational 
sport, something not a necessity in 
the world, should not be changed 
for him. He should play at his level, 
or find something else he can do. 

sors, the department currently has 
two world-renowned graduate 
schools in international relations: 
the School of International Rela-
tions and Pacific Studies and the 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation. 

While most political science 
majors here continue on to law 
schools on other campuses, it is 
high time the school started keep-
ing these bright graduates. Why 
produce such bright students if 
we're not going to keep them? 
And as most political science 
majors here wish to continue on 
to law school, it is only logical to 
have one. 

Obviously, these two schools 
cannot be built in the near future. 
But that does not mean plans 
should not be developed to start 
looking into the possibility of hav-
ing such graduate schools. With 
the expansion of the university to 
include a sixth college and a rising 
student population, as well as ris-
ing prestige, it seems inevitable 
that UCSD should get a business 
school and law school. These are 
the only things that are keeping 
UCSD down. Having these 
schools would put UCSD on the 
map and guarantee that our cam-
pus would be considered seriously 
among the best in the nation .

~D & NATION 
First Amendment Flap: In God We Trust, 
In Government We're Not So Confident 

Ma ny Americans are enthusi-
astic about President Bush's pro-
posa l to fu nnel federal funds to 
re ligious social service programs. 
BlIt, as polls indica te, America ns 
across the political spectrum are 
wary of anything that appears to 
tamper with the First Amen~­
memo 

Those on the left worry about 
religion meddling with govern-
ment. Celinda Lake, a Democratic 
pollster, said: "It has to do with 
thei r sense of whether or not the 
services wi ll be provided fairly, and 
with whether or not people have 
other options. 111ey don't in gener-
al like it when religious institutions 
are the only choice, because if you 
don't like that religion, you've got 
no place else to to go. 

Those on the right worry 
about government meddling with 
religion. Cal Thomas, the conser-
vative columnist , wrote: 

dom of a church or synagogue or 
mosque. If executed carelessly, 
Bush's plan could spring all three 
of those traps. 

"This is an area that is filled 
with land mines: said Mark Penn, 
a Democratic pollster. "Looking at 
public opinion data, it could be 
summed up as 'Yes, but don 't go 
too far:" 

HI? PllOto

will be aggressive civil libertarians, 
some agnostic Ivy League profes-
sors and liberal editorial writers. 

"Religious organizations might be 
tempted, or forced, to dilute their 
life- transforming message to get 
government subsidies, thus negat-
ing the primary reason for their 
success. They also risk becoming 
an appendage of the party in 
power." 

Americans may not be able to 
recite the First Amendment, or 
perhaps even explain it, but they 
are uncomfortable when their 
government appears to promote 
one religion over another, or 
allows discrim ination based on 
religion, or interferes in the free-

Yet, by creating a new White 
House Office of Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives, Bush is 
betting that most Americans care 
more about helping poor people 
than they do about the First 
Amendment. The conventional 
wisdom in the White House is 
that the on ly people alarmed 
about a potentiat breach in the 

So, as the plan was rolled out 
last week, the White House did 
not articulate clear answers to 
many of the questioris the pro-
posal had provoked. By Thursday, 
Bush sought to assure the public, 
saying, "I'm interested in what is 

. constitutional, and I'm interested 
in what works."

Women to Join the Ballot 

CHATAULI ., France - Most 
of the 35 women who gathered 
here in a City Hall conference 
room recently had shown up for 
moral support, either because they 
had decided to run for local office 
in the Brittany region, or because 
they were mulling a decision to

Right now, 7 percent of France's 

mayors and almost 9 percent of its 
national legislators are women. 
That is roughly comparable with 
the United States, where 13 percent 
of senators are women, but far 
behind the 45 percent of Sweden's 
legislators who are women.

u.s. Panel Seek. Change. 
in AIDS Virus Treatment 

CHICAGO - Altering a long-
held policy, federal health officials are 
now recommending that . treatment 
for the AIDS virus be delayed as long 
as possible for people without symp-
toms because of increased concerns 
over toxic effects of the therapies. 

The new guidelines, written by a 
federal panel and due to be 
announced on Monday, represent a 
major philosophical shift in treat-
ing HIY, the AIDS virus. 

Instead of the "hit early, hit 
hard" approach in effect since 

would mean that some infected 
people might defer costly therapy 
for up to three years and ultimately 
decrease the risk of the toxicities, 
said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the 
director of the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 

The aggressive approach to 
treating HIV was adopted shortly 
after protease inhibitor drugs were 
marketed and then combined with 
older drugs in 1996. These drug 
cocktails, which sUppress the 
amount of HIV in the blood

approach calls for 
waiting until the 
immune system 
shows serious signs 
of weakening or 
HIV levels in the 
blood far exceed 
those for which 
treatment is recom-
mended. 

And many experts 
advocated earry 
treatment for healthy 
infected people to 
prevent damage to 
the immune system.

tests could detect,

responses, with 
many AIDS

their deathbeds or 
going back to 
work. And many 
experts advocated 
early treatment for 
healthy infected The panel, con-

vened by the Department of 
Health and Human Services and 
the Henry j. Kaiser Family 
Foundation, still recommends 
therapy for anyone who develops 
symptoms of AIDS. Therapy 
should also be given to people 
whose blood tests show they have 
been infected for less than six 
months, in the belief that early 
treatment might strengthen the 
immune system's ability to fight 
the virus, the panel says. 

Such guidelines have no force

said: "The court decisions have

The 64-page report broke 

ground in calling for a study of 
the potential for international 
cooperation on taxation matters, 
including tax evasion. It also 
suggested an arrangement to 
assemble all creditors whenever a 
country needs to restructure for-
eign debt. And it raised the 
prospect, "in exceptional cir-
cumstances and where appropri-
ate," of a moratorium or cancel-
lation of a debt when a country 
cannot pay. 

"While debt relief is just one of 
various financial assistance instru-
ments," the repon said, "it is impor-

A few virologists raised hopes 
that in a short time the drugs might 
eliminate HIV from the body, thus 
achieving a cure and obviating any 
drug therapy. 

But studies show that the drug 
cocktails do not cure HIY, and 
when infected people stop therapy, 
the virus rebounds, making lifetime 
therapy necessary.

In view of those coun deci-
sions, state and local officials said, 
they now have a heavier burden,to 
justify the creation of additional 
districts in which black or 
Hispanic voters are ilJ the majori-
ty. 

Jon Boller, a staff lawyer for 
the N~w Mexico Legislature, 
said: "We must satisfy the 
requirements of Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act, which says 
you must take race into account 
on some level. But at the same 
time, we cannot make race the 
primary factor." 

In 1991, under pressure from 
the Justice Department, many 
states tried to maximize the num-
ber of districts controlled by black 
or Hispanic voters. The Supreme 
Court later said that was not 
required. This year many state 
legislators say their goal is simply 
to prevent a reduction in the 
number of minority-controlled 
districts.

Last September, world leaders

DanceSafe 
propagates 
healthy choices for 
members of the . 
rave and night 
club 
community 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

® ance culture has seeped I inescapably into main-stream culture over the last decade. Whether it's a 
commercial trying to sell a 

Ford Focus by making allusions to 
Detroit techno, or "60 Minutes" cover-
ing drug use at raves, the national 
focus has turned toward the analysis 
- and sometimes the deprecation -
of dance culture and everything 
remotely connected with it. As the 
media sounds a cacophony over all 
things rave, some work in the back-
ground to ensure that those in the 
middle of the tug-of-war get the infor-
mation they need to make informed 
decisions. DanceSafe answers to that 
description. 

DanceSafe is a national, nonprofit 
organization dedicated to harm reduc-
tion and education in the rave and club 
scene. Its members distribute poten-
tially life-saving information at parties, 
giving partygoers an objective and 
nonjudgmental source to which they 
can tum for assistance. Headed by a 
national office in - kland, Calif., 
DanceSafe chapters around the United 
States and Canada establish their pres-
ence in various cities, working to make 
the rave scene safer for people who 
choose to compliment their experience 
with substances. 

DanceSafe representatives go to 
parties and clubs, handing out free 
information and resources ranging 

from substance information and 
earplugs to candy bracelets and con-
doms. The emphasis is on peer support 
apd education, and all work is done by 
volunteers. 

Though DanceSafe has been noto-
rious in the recent media for its pill-
testing services, members of the orga-
nization do much more than spend all 
night at raves telling 16-year-olds what 
their pills contain. However, 
DanceSafe has ridden to phenomenal 
success based upon the usefulness of 
this service, especially since MDMA, a 
psychotropic substance commonly 
known as ecstasy, has shot into popu-
lar use, and the fact that it is the first 
truly nationwide organization that 
effectively provides harm-reduction 
education to people. 

New chapters spring up all the 
time. According to the organization'S 
Web site, http/lwww.dancesafe.org, chap-
ters have recently opened in New York 
City, Philadelphia and Calgary. 

Last summer, DanceSafe gave its 
name to a chapter in San Diego. The 
chapter began as an organization 
caned San Diego RaveSmart, covering 
its first event in July. In October, the 
group received approval to carry the 
DanceSafe name. 

Since its inception, the San Diego 
~~apter h~s met with success and pos-
itive reacttons at every tum. Director 
Melissa Martin attributes this triumph 
to the chapter's warm reception from 

FEATURES 10 

the rave community and law enforce-
ment. 

"The rave community in San Diego 
has opened [its) arms and embraced 
us," Martin said. "We have become an 
integral part of the rave scene in San 
Diego. Out of all the chapter directors 
that I've spoken with around the coun-
try, we have had the most welcoming 
and easiest time of it. We're so grateful 
to the rave community in San Diego 
for that." 

Law enforcement, too, has been 
welcoming to the group, showing tem-
perance in spite of the recent hyper-
bolic media frenzy over the rave scene, 
particularly concerning substance use 
at parties. 

"Law enforcement has been noth-
ing but supportive of DanceSafe, and 
we have not had any negative experi-
ences with them [in San Diego): 
Martin said. "They understand that 
we're on their side. We're there to help 
them do their job," 

The San Diego chapter covered its 
first event last July after approaching a 
rave promoter, who responded favor-
ably to the idea of having a DanceSafe 
booth present at the event. Subsequent 
DanceSafe coverage has been prompt-
ed at the request gf the promoters 
themselves. 

"We have to be invited: said San

society that values performance in 
class over actually learning what is 
being taught. When a student 
receives a graded midterm, there 
are only two things in his mind: 
The first is, "what's my grade?" 
and the second is, "what's the 
average?" We fight for every single 
point so that our grades can be a 
fraction higher. Grades are impor-
tant, but knowledge is even more 
so. 

Does it really matter what 
another person gets? Performance 
should be measured by one stan-
dard. Who cares if the class did 
better or worse? It ultimately 
cOp1es down to one person: you. 
Nevertheless, in a university 
where we are not taught to be our 
own thinkers, it is a necessity that 
we do better than the person sit-
ting next to us. Your neighbor is 
your enemy; you must do better 
than him if you want to do well in 
a course. But does it really matter 
20 years from now what you got 

on your second midterm in your 
bio class? 

We measure one's intelligence 
based on how well he studies or 
cra ms. [n my years at UCSD, I do 
not look back upon the grea t 
wonders of writing, reading, ca l-
culus, chemistry nor anything 
related to academia. All I remem-
ber is a constant feeling of-having 
made certain that I was above the 
average and that my grade was 
good. We live in a competitive 
arena that makes learning no 
longer a passion, but rather, a 
blood sport, a sport in which only 
the strongest survive and everyone 
else must die. This competitive-
ness is not only evident in class, 
but everywhere in our daily lives. 

Once we graduate, grades are 
no longer the main objective in 
our lives. We aim for a higher and 
nobler purpose: money. This train 
of thought from college to work 
hard to be better than anyone else 
now appears in the workplace. We 
all think that money is the great 
equalizer, as if it was the single 
force in our lives that can fix all 
our problems and all our miseries. 
It is as if cash can bum away all 
our troubles the way it can burn 
so quickly from our accounts. 
Having that new luxury car may 
be nice, but is it justifiable to work 
night and day for the rest of your 
life without rest. We know money 
is a problem, yet we continue to 
find new ways to have more of it. 

Money is similar to grades as it 
defines how successful you are in

Arle. (March 21·April19) 
New friendships and business 

partnerships will now bring a 
noticeable rise in confidence, Aries. 
Before mid-week your mental focus, 
workplace determination and ability 
to attract new relationships will be 
particularly attractive to others. 
Many Aries natives will experience 
this in business relationships but 
some, especially those born early in 
April, may also find that friendships 
and romance are strongly affected. 
Express your ideas, Aries; potential 
friends are listening. 

' ... ru. (April 2D-May 20) 
Early this week, Taurus, a work 

official may offer your services or 
time to others. Business triangles 
and quickly changing schedules 
may be a theme over the next few 
days. Remain diplomatic: This is 
not a good time to publicly doubt 
the expertise or decisions of 
authority figures. Latenhis week, a 
new romantic attraction may be 
surprisingly seductive. Watch for 
quick flirtations or unexpected 
invitations in the workplace. Trust 
your instincts, Taurus: complex 
social ethics may be at issue. 

Canc., (June 22-July 22) 
Work officials or long-term 

business partners may be particu-
larly critical of your actions and 
decisions this week. Key issues 
involve recently broken contracts 
or failed financial proposals. Long-
term effects will be minimal, 
Cancer, so not to worry. Do, how-
ever, expect fellow workers to be 
temporarily self absorbed and 
moody. Later this week, a friend or 
workmate may cancel recent plans. 
Be receptive to new ideas or sched-
ules: Before mid-March , loved ones 
will find it difficult to choose social 
priorities. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Daily routines will s implify 

early this week , Leo. Recent mis-
understandings with authority fig-
ures or annoyi ng changes to 
paperwork will no longer be an 
issue in working relationships. By 
mid-week, expect business offi-
cials or key colleagues to clearly 
focus on creative ideas, new pro-
cedures or future growth . Later 
this week, a close friend may be

Lance Ken. "We can't just go to a 
party and say 'Hi, we're San Diego 
DanceSafe. We're going to set up 
now.' The promoter has to want 
us there." 

The chapter typically covers 
one or two events per week, but its 
activity level depends on the activ-
ity level of the San Diego rave 
scene at any given time. 

"It really depends on how the 
rave scene is going," Ken said. 
"Sometimes you'll get a lot of 
raves going on, sometimes none 
for three weeks." 

In its busiest weekend to date, 
Ken said, the chapter covered four 
parties on four consecutive nights. 

The challenges in maintaining 
a successful DanceSafe chapter, 
both in San Diego and nationally, 
have come in trying to eradicate 
stereotypes and misconceptions 
associated with the work that 
DanceSa{e does. 

In the · last two weeks alone, 
"The New York Times Magazine~ 
and "U.S. News & World Report" 
have run lengthy pieces dealing 
with ecstasy usage, and tangential-
ly, the rave scene. In the last six 

. months, "60 Minutes; "48 
Hours" and MTV have covered 
the rising trends of the use of 
ecstasy. The media has promoted 
awareness and misunderstanding 
alike. 

Due to heightened interest in 
the trends surrounding ecstasy 
use - U.S. Customs officials 
seized 2.1 million tablets in Los 
Angeles last summer in a highly 
publicized bust - more heads are 
turning and more fingers are 
being pointed. As an organization 
squarely in the middle of some of 
the most heated controversy, 

spread by the. media. . 
"There are a lot of misconcep-

tions about DanceSafe out there, 
like that we condone drug use, 
that we enable drug use, that we 
even promote drug use," Martin 
said. "We don't. We are a public 
health education organization. We 
are there because we're the only 
ones around who are giving kids 
the information they need. Not 

"Not onry do we give 
them the information 
they need and want, we 
give it to them at the 
place where they need it 
the most - a party or a 
club - at a time when 
they're rrwst willing to 
listen. " 

- ............. 
Director, San Diego RaveSmart 

only do we give them the informa-
tion they need and want, we give it 
to them at the place where they 
need it the most - a party or a 
club - at a time when they're 
most willing to listen." 

DanceSafe volunteers place 
emphasis on the fact that they 
educate the public. but they are 
not there to make decisions for 
people. Volunteers will test pills 
for substances, but they will not 
tell pill owners what they ought to 
do with that information. 

"We're not there to tell them, 
'Don't take drugs, they're bad:" 
Kett said. 

Martin addressed the common 
controversy that surrounds the 

In fact, testing methods are not 
specific enough to reveal many 
aspects of a pill's composition. 
Testing will determine whether a 
pill has an ecstasy-like substance, 
but these also include MDMA's 
cousins MDE, MDA and MDEA. 
Testing will not reveal how pure a 
pill is, nor whether it is safe to 
take. DanceSafe - volunteers can 
tell people the facts about their 
pills, but they cannot decide for 
anyone whether to take the pill. 

Pill testing has put DanceSafe 
at the forefront of a media storm, 
especially due to recent deaths 
across the United States associat-
ed with people who took a pill 
they thought contained an ecsta-
sy-like substance but which was, 
in fact , something else. 

Two common adulterants 
include DXM, a constituent of 
cough syrup, and PMA. Though 
some people enjoy the highs 
these drugs can provide, those 
who take them and expect an 
ecstasy-like reaction can run into 
difficulties taking care of them-
selves. The body's reaction to 
these drugs is different than that 
of MDMA, and an unknowing 
user may face dangers such as 
heat stroke. Even more dangerous 
is the ingestion of MDMA and 
one of these substances simulta-
neouslt Pill testing can help 
determme whether a pill contains 
a drug like PMA or DXM. 

For those who do not venture 
out into the rave scene but who 
stand to benefit from the infor-

What are the easiest and hardest majors at UCSD? 
Interviews arid Photos by Tyler Huff 

"1 opted for the 
~asiest major, which 
IS 
communication, 
and-I would have to 
say engineering 
would be the 
hardest one." 

Mike Hunter 
Warren senior 

"1 think the 
hardest major at 
UCSD is Spanish 
literature, and I 
think the easiest 
one is general bio." 

"The hardest major 
has to be political 
science, because we 
are the only people 
who understand 
how the real world 
works. The easiest 
majors have to be 
the communication 
majors because they 
don't really have to 
work that hard. Just

"I think the 
easiest would be 
psychology. That's 
what most of my 
friends resort to 
after dropping out 
of the science 
majors. The 
hardest major 
would be 
chemistry because 
there is so much 
competition and the 
professors spend so 
much time on their 
research." 

"From what I hear, 
engineers have it 
pretty damn tough, 
but communication 
is the easiest, 
because you could 
basically say 
anything, and if you 
can back it up with 
your own kind of 
evidence, the 
teacher will give you 
an 'A.'" 

"Psychology is the 
easiest, just because 
a lot of things are 
just human nature 
and common sense, 
and the hardest one 
would be some kind 
of math _major."

The UCS~ scoring began in

stole third base and sephomore 
catcher Kristin Hunstad drove her

Hunstad later advanced to third

The bottom of the sixth inning

UCSD. The Eagle defense com-
mitted crucial errors and the 
Tritons took advantage, getting 
five runs off four hits. Mettee was 
busy on the base paths, stealing 
second and third base en route to 
crossing home plate on a wild

three stolen bases. 

The game was called in the

three returnees from last season, so 
we needed the victory to gel as a 
team." 

As they look ahead at the 
upcoming season, it is clear in' the 
minds of the players that UC Davis 
is the team to beat. They are ranked 
first in the CCAA, and they have yet 
to playa conference game. The sec-
ond seed is UCSD, with Sonoma 
State closely behind. Neither 'of 
these teams has lost a conference 
game. Thus. the weekend of March 3 
will be the real key to the season, as 
the Tritons travel to Sonoma and 
Davis to face their bitter rivals. 

QUALITY FOOD • HANDCRAFTED BEER • SUPERIOR SERVICE 
With only three returnees, senior

Volleyball Handle Princeton With Ease 
UCSD sweep visitors from the IVY League three games to none 

Associate Sports Editor 

Can you dig it? In the cozy con-
fines of RIMAC Arena, the lhton 
men's volleyball team rolled to vic-
tory over Princeton University 
Thursday night. UCSD came to 
play and hoped to pick up its first 
victory of the season. That is exact-
ly what it did. 

Led by the inspired play of 
seniors 2ach Hite and Donald 
Chen, the Tritons pounded their 
way to a three-game sweep over the 
Princeton plebeians. As a crowd of 
181 eagerly cheered them on, 
UCSD locked up the three-game 

Women:

point victory, 63-44. 
Fok remarked, "Everyone on 

this team stepped it up and we did 
what we needed to win: 

Ruvald sited a difference in the 
teams. 

"They were playing not to lose, 
and we were playing to win," she 
said. 

The Tritons contained a Davis 

match with scores of 32-30,30-23, 
and 30-26. It took extra points for 
the Tritons to seal the deal in the 
first set, but it was all blue and gold 
love from there on out. 

The dominating victory was a 
shot in the arm for UCSD, as it had 
struggled through its first four 
matches. 

The Tritons played their previ-
ous match against perennial volley-
ball powerhouse Long Beach State 
Wednesday night at the ugly-look-
ing Pyramid in the LBC. While they 
played an impressive first set, bat-
tling hard before falling 30-27. The 
next two sets were not as close, at 
30-23 and 30-19, but you could 

offense that had three Aggie 
starters averaging over 10 points 
per game and all five starters over 
nine points per game, but this con-
test was another story. 

. "Every player on their team had 
a strength, which we took away." 
Ruvald said. 

T he Aggies' leading scorer was 
6-foot-4-inch junior center Janae 
Henning with 10 points, followed 
by guard Shea Purkiss with eight 
points. 

This defensive effort was partly 
due to UCSD's extensive prepara-
tion, which included analyzing 
three of Davis' game tapes. 

"We knew what they were going 

see the progress the team has made 
and could tell that a victory was 
right around the corner. 

The Tri tons will use the 
Princeton victory to establish some 
momentum and pump them up for 
their next match, which will be a 
nonconference tilt with University 
of La Verne. The Tritons should 
use this opportunity to rack up 
some big points and let out some 
aggression. 

The Tritons will next be in 
action this Friday and Saturday 
night, when they will playa pair 
versus Brigham Young University 
out in the cold, dreary abyss that is 
Provo, Utah. 

to do before they did," Fok said. 
The determination of the 

Thitons was also a factor. . 
"They outsized us in every posi-

tion" Fok said. "And we probably 
outrebounded them." 

As a matter of fact they did, 36-
33. UCSD also beat the Aggies in 
assists, three-pointers, steals and 
free throws. For Fok. this was the 
best revenge she could have. 

"This is even better [than 
imaginedl," she said. "There's no 
words to describe what I'm feel-
ing." 

Well, it's a birthday present, and 
it sure beats that scratchy woolen 
sweater from Aunt Gertrude.

Women's Tennis 
Off to a 
Smashing Start 
The Tritons walk all ov.er 
Grand Canyon University on 
Friday, winning 8-1 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCS D women 's tennis 
team earned its second victory in a 
row after defeating Grand CaJ"lYon 
University 8-1 at UCSD's north 
courts on Friday. 

The match agai nst Grand 
Canyon displayed the dominance 
UCSD has in the singles portion of 
matches. The Tritons took fi ve of 
the six singles matches, with clutch 
three-set performances from No. 1 
freshman Ashley O'Neil and No.3 
junior Lyndsey Tadlock. 

NO. 4 player Kristina Jansen , a 
freshman , and o. 6 player Jaime 
Walker, a senior, cruised to easy 
victories in their single matches 6-
I, 6-1 and 6-0, 6-4 respectively. 

In the doubles competition , 
UCSD made a clean sweep of it. 
Tadlock and St~phanie Moriarity 
defeated Point Lorna's team of 
Robin 'jaeger and Christina 
Klokinis 8-6. J o. 2 team julie 
Westerman and Melisa Liao defeat-
ed Christine Liwanpo and Sarah 
Mitchell 8-6; and the combo of 
0' cd and jansen defeated Denia 
Combs and Katie Robins 8-4. All of 
the clements that hurt them against 

Long Beach State University 
seemed to work against Point 
Loma. _ 

"The Long Beach match was 
more of a practice for us, just to see 
what kind of tennis is out there," 
Liao said. "We knew going in that 
the match was going to be really 
tough , and the team basically used 
it to get a feel for the competition 
in Division I." 

On jan. 30, the team from Point 
Loma Nazarene came to town and 
seemed no trouble for UCSD. Last 
year the Tritons won two matches 
against Point Loma, one with a 
score of7-2, dropping only the first 
two singles matches. On Tuesday, 
the team won a comfortable 6-3 
victo!),. In that match, UCSD's No. 
1 player O'Neil had a tough time 
handling Anna Sieczka from Point 
Loma and lost in a tough three-set-
tcr. Overall the si ngles portion 
favored the Tritons, as the remain-
ing five players won thcir matches, 
capped by Westerman 's romp over 
Point Loma's julie Krause 6-1, 6-0. 

"Against Point Loma, the match 
itself wasn't too hard because we 
were psyched to rebound from the

Men's Basketball Gets a Rare 
Win, Defeating Chico State 
Tritons squeak by Chico in front of a crowd of 2,352 on Friday but 
are not as successful against Davis, losing 70-56 on Saturday 
IIylConBURIIOUGHI 
Associate Sports Editor 

Who rocks the body that rocks 
the party? Who rocks the body that 
rocks the party? I'll tell you who -
the UCSD men's basketball team, 
that's who. They were the ones 
rocking the party that went down 
Friday night at a posh, high-profile 
San Diego venue. 

That venue was RIMAC Arena, 
to be further referred to only as 
"The Macky," and the party was 
Spirit Night 2001 . Men's and 
women's basketball games were on 

~ap and 2,352 boozed-up and rag-
IIlg revelers were on hand to bask in 
the event's glow. 

Of course, what's a party with-
out a good 01' fashioned ass-whup-
pirrg, lind on that count the Triton 
B-ball squad was more than happy 
to oblige. The poor souls on the 
short end of this festive bludgeon-
ing were the players of Chico State, 
as they lost their heart, their soul, 
and their wallet in La Jolla. Oh, and 
they lost the game too, as the rau-
cous Macky crowd roared its 
approval. 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
eight-point first half lead and never 
looked back, leading by 17 at one 
point and winning by the final 
score of 68-64. While the final 
score was close, there was never a 
doubt in the minds of the Triton 
fans. Well, maybe there was an 
inkling of doubt when Chico State 
tied the game with 19 seconds left, 
but then Cole Miller and Sam 

Higgins both sank two free throws 
in the waning moments to seal the 
deal. 

The Tritons were led by the 
clutch play of forward Higgins, who 
had a team high with 27 points on 
6-15 shooting. Even more impres-
sive is that his points were all 
recorded on three pointers and free 
throws. Higgins also came up big 
on the boards, pulling down 13 
rebounds. Guard Nick Christensen 
also had a hand in the effort, net-
ting 12 points, as did Cameron 
Jackson who had 11 on the night. 

Chico State had solid perfor-
mances from guard Deon 
Robinson, who had 19 points and 
eight rebounds, Lee McCowan who 
had 12 points, and jon Henderson, 
who was 5-12 shooting for nine 
points. Alan Case also pitched in 
with 10 rebounds. 

It wasn't enough to topple the 
Triton attack, and UCSD notched 
its third check in the win column. 
The game was strong, the crowd 
was rowdy, and the team was 
pumped and ready to take on their 
next challenger. 

The excitement faded once this 
challenger, in the form of UC 
Davis, showed up on the Macky's 
doorstep the following night. They 
came in and abruptly cut the Triton 
winning streak short before it even 
had a chance to get going. The 
Tritons took the court full of swag-
ger, which intimidated the Aggies. 
This led to a 32-29 first half lead for 
the Tritons. They could not hold on 
though, as Davis made a run to 

come back and take the game by a 
final score of 70-56. 

The Tritons simply could not 
get their offense on track in ~he sec-
ond half, and Davis took this 
opportunity to build a lead and sit 
oni!. 

UCSD saw another quality per-
formance from Higgins, who had 
13 points on the night. The rest of 
the offense experienced a letdown 
from the previous night's action, as 
the other four starting Tritons com-
bined for a paltry 24 points. Ryan 
Rikansrud came off the bench to 
contribute nine points. Erik Ramp 
picthed in with seven points. 

These performances were over-
shadowed by the Tritons' UC coun-
terparts, who had a n umber of play-
ers put up solid numbers. Dominic 
Calori led with 13 points on 5-11 
shooting, while fellow Aggie Keith 
Johnson also hit double figures 
with 10. jess Mcelrce had nine 
points to go along with his nine 
rebounds and jordan Moss also 
knocked down nine points-worth 
of buckets. 

With the win the Aggies record 
improved to 9-5 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play 
and 12-7 overall . The Tritons saw 
their record fall to 2-12 in CCAA 
play and 3-16 overall . 

The Tritons hope to have more 
games like Friday's and less like 
Saturday'S in the future. They will 
next get a chance to make good on 
those hopes Friday, when they will 
be traveling to Rohnert Park to go 
dome to dome with Sonoma State.

Pro Bowl is 
Anti-Climactic 
Season Ending 

Fulton 
Corner. 

ROBERT FULTON 

Y esterday. the FL held its annual exhibition of all-star talent. the infamous 
Pro Bowl. 

The prevailing question for 
many people. including me. during 
this compelling sporting event was 
"Why?" 

The Pro Bowl is not like other 
sports' all-star games. It comes at 
the end of the season bt:cause it is 
too risky to play in the mid.dle of 
the season as other sports do. By 
the time the game is finally 
played. no one really cares any 
more. The ultimate game. the 
Super Bowl. has already taken 
place. After that. everything else is 
anti-climactic. 

The Pro Bowl is an honor. but a 
small one compared to . other all-
star games. Every year. a rash of 
mysterious injuries appear just 
before the game. 

This is because the players just 
don't care. Sure. they enjoy the 
free trip to Hawaii for the game. 
but after that, they just want to 
have fun . They have just played 
16 games - more if they made it 
to the post season. By the time of 
the Pro Bowl. the season is over 
and the players are ready to move 
on . 

Baseball and basketball are a lit-
tle different. They both have all-
star games that are much better 
than football's equivalent. 
Baseball's all-star game has gOt to 
be the best. The matchup between 
the I\:ational League and the 
American League is a sports clas-
sic. It is truly an honor to be select-
ed. 

It is also a welcomed break in 
the middle of a grueling season. 
Players come. they fraternize. and 
then each play only a couple of 
innings on a nice July evening. 
Sure. there are some dissenters 
who get "injured" before the game. 
but not nearly as many as the NFL. 
Plus. baseball has the home run 
derby. which is always a fan 
favorite. 

Basketba ll's mid-season get-
together is also fun . Just watch the 
players; you can tell that they're 
having fun. Sure. the game is not 
that great. and that can be argued 
of any NBA game. but the players 
are not taking it seriously. As in 
baseball. they are just hanging 
out. enjoying the midseason break 
and the chance to play with the 
best players around. Basketball 
also has the th ree-point shootout 
and the dunk contest. which 
brings even more fun and excite-
ment. 

What shou ld the NFL do? I 
don't know. They should not 
scrap it. It is sti ll fun to see some 
of the league's best perform . They 
should move it to the middle of 
the season. but tone it down a lit-
tle so there is less risk of injury. 
Then they could get rid of that 
bye week once the league expands 
to 32 teams. 

People would pay a lot more 
attention to what was going on if 
the game were in the middle of 
the season instead of after the 
season. 

Right now. no one cares.

Softball Wins First Pair 
Tritons begin the new season on the right foot, taking two 
victories, 4-0 and 9-1 , from Biola at home on Saturday 
By GLORIA CHUNG 
St aff Writ er 

In its first two games of the sea-
son. the UCSD softball team best-
ed visiting Biola University. If the 
weekend's performance was any 
indication of the team's prospects 
this season. then the Tritons are in 
great shape for Division II compe-
titIon. 

Junior Leea Harlan pitched for 
UCSD in the first game of the 
doubleheader. She was masterful. 
allowing no runs and striking out 
eight Eagle batters over six 
innings. 

The teams battled through two 
scoreless inn ings. but Biola 
threatened in the top of the third. 
With no outs. the Eagles put two 
runners on. Fortunate ly, the 
Tritons' ace in the circle shut the 
door. Harlan struck out the next 
batter. got a force out at third. and 
ended the inning with another 
strikeout. 

In the bottom of the third 
inning. UCSD exploded for four 
runs. Junior Samantha Hayes led 
off with a double and scored the 
game's first run off a triple by 
Kristina Anderson. Freshman Kim 
Aggabao followed with a sacrifice 
fly to bring Anderson in for the 
second run. After getting the sec-
ond out of the inning from 
Harlan. Biola committed a costly 
error that allowed Christina 
Searing to reach base and kept the 
Triton inning alive. Michelle

ter field for a triple. driving in 
Seering from first base. Wilson 
crossed the plate for the final run 
of the inning on Jeanine Cordero's 
single. 

In the fifth inning. third base-
man Cordero robbed Biola of a 
sure hit when she dove to her left 
for the ground ball and gunned it 
to first for the out. In the same

Splits the Weekend 
Tritons grab 63-44 win over Davis on 
Saturday, bring redemption for Fok 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Though it took over a month. 
jun ior point guard Maya Fok's 
teammates finally delivered her 
birthday present. 

"We asked her what she want-
ed: said senior forward 
Genevieve Ruvald. "She said 'to 
beat Davis ... · 

Last Saturday night at RIMAC 
Arena. the Tritons did just that. 
dominating the Aggies en route to 
a 63-44 victory. The win evened 
UCS D's conference record at 7-7 
and tied them with Davis in 
league competition. 

"We didn 't just beat them. we 
anni hilated them " Fok said . 
"This is the happiest I've ever 
been." 

Fok. who played for Davis last 
year, was instrumental for the 
lritons' win. dishing out eight 
assists along with eight points and 
four steals. Ruvald was on fire the 
whole game, shooting a blistering 
7-16 from the field. including 3-6 
from downtown. to lead all scor-
ers with 19 points. 

It went back and forth for most 
of the first half. until UCSD start-
ed to pull away with a few min-
utes left. Ruvald made a three-
pointer. and the Triton's defense 
stifled the Aggies offense. At the 
half. UCSD was sitting on the 
happy end of a 30-21 score. 

However. the Tritons were not 
satisfied with a nine-point lead. 
and they opened the second half 
with a bucket from senior forward 
Ashley Kokjohn and began to lay 
it on. 

UCSD continued to command 
the game offensively. easily 
bypassing Davis' half-court press, 
and defensively, shutting down 
the Aggie offense with an impres-
sive 2-3 zone setup .. 

As Davis fell further and fur-
ther behind. the displeased Davis 
pep band attempted to rattle Fok 
at the free throw line, chanting 
"You're not an Aggie." However. 
she effectively silenced them by 
sinking both shots to push the 
score to 45-27. 

The ball continued to bounce 
the UCSD's way, as the Tritons 
shot an astounding 42.3 percent 
from the field in the second half 
while holding the Aggies to 25 .0 
percent. 

In the end, UCSD had humili-
ated Davis to the tune of a 1 9-

inning, freshman shortstop Amy 
Mettee made a diving effort for a 
short line blooper in front of sec-
ond base to retire the batter. 

The last threat that Biola posed 
was a lead-off single in the sev-
enth. However, that was as far as 
the Eagles got. The next three bat-
ters were put down in order and 
the Tritons preserved their 4-0 

shutout. 
In the second game of the dou-

bleheader, junior Christi 
Martinelli was in the circle for the 
Tritons and the UCSD dominance 
continued. They lit up Biola for 
nine runs while holding the Eagles 
to only one. 

See SOFTBALL, page 15 

The game began with strong 
defensive efforts from both teams. 
but UCSD finally got on the 
board with a jumper from the free 
throw line by Ruvald and two bas-
kets by sophomore guard 
Nicholle Bromley. Set WOMDI, page 16 ...... 1M 1Iitons' Gtrrnieut RulHlld goes up for II shot this wttUntl.
