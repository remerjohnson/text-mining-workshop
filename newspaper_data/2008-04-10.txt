Rue Banks on Students 
to Pay for Larger Festival

THE NEW FACE OF SUN GOD

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN FILE
Security costs for the Sun God Festival will double this year, as programmers plan to substitute the use of 
undercover officers for uniformed authorities from other universities in a completely remade day-long event.

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue turned down a request 
from student officials to cover extra 
security expenses for this year’s Sun 
God Festival, now made a larger 
endeavor after administrators and A.S. 
councilmembers joined in an effort to 
remake the concert into a community-
building event.

In recent years, programmers 
employed contracted security person-
nel and undercover officers at a $15,000 
flat fee. However, concerns over securi-
ty management have increased, follow-
ing a concert last year that saw a rise in 
the number of event-related arrests and 
citations. A.S. Programming requested 
over $17,000 from Student Affairs in 
the hopes of defraying security expen-
ditures that have doubled this year.

A.S. Vice President of Student Life 
Donna Bean, whose office oversees the 
programming department, said that 
nearly one-third of students were too 
intoxicated during the day to make it 
to the nighttime concert, which last 
year featured hip-hop artist T.I.

Last year’s alarming figures spurred 
Bean, a presidential candidate in this 
week’s A.S. elections, and the program-
ming department, headed by Assistant 

Vice President of Programming Kevin 
Highland, to commission an all-cam-
pus review of the festival that opened 
up its operations to critiques from 
almost every department. The com-
plaints were compiled into a 22-page 
Sun God Planning Report released in 
October, and programmers have since 
rebuilt the festival to alleviate worry 
about botched security and safety mea-
sures. The report detailed electronic 
entrance lines that malfunctioned last 
year and stranded crowds of unruly 
concertgoers.

In past interviews, Rue has said that 
the festival was becoming increasingly 
unmanageable for student program-
mers and event coordinators. 

“[Sun God started] as a homegrown 
event and developed to a point where 
its infrastructure is overwhelmed,” she 
said in January. “But we believe it can 
be reined in.”

Rue also backed the report’s claims 
that the festival had diverged from 
its original community-building ide-
als. Programmers responded by gut-
ting the event’s layout and operations, 
establishing a new day-long, carni-
val-like attraction located on RIMAC 
Field. The new event, hosted this year 
on May 16, adds a nighttime DJ-hosted 
dance, booths for both vendors and 
student organizations and an area for 
student-produced artwork and films.

But hosting the new festival will 
be a significantly costlier undertaking, 
according to Festival Director Garrett 
Berg, especially in the near future.

“We truly were depending on 

Student affairs rejects 
council’s request for 
help with security costs, 
which are doubled this 
year with new festival.

In a move to establish greater stu-
dent influence over the allocation of 
funds derived from student fees, the 
A.S. Council voted unanimously last 
week to pass a constitutional amend-
ment that places new, more extensive 
regulations on all future campus-
based student fee referenda. 

The amendment, which institutes 

a set of standards by which to draft 
the text of any fee-related referen-
dum, was designed in part to ensure 
that students voting on such mea-
sures are provided with all informa-
tion relevant to the implementation 
of any proposed fee changes. 

Chair of the Registration 
Fee Advisory Committee Garo 
Bournoutian, who authored the 
amendment’s original draft, said that 
with these changes, students will now 

have the chance to review multiple, 
explicitly stated facets of a referen-
dum included directly on the bal-
lot and thus better comprehend the 
measures proposed before casting 
their vote.

“This amendment kind of aims 
to get people to really understand 
what’s being included in a ballot 
measure and what they’re actually

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
recently proposed cuts to public 
education funding have sent a shock-
wave through K-12 public schools, 
both forcing principals statewide 
to downsize their staffs and raising 
statewide concerns about students’ 
level of preparation for postsecond-
ary work. 

In order to compensate for 
a $14.5-billion state deficit, 
Schwarzenegger’s proposal calls for 
a 10-percent funding reduction to 
nearly all state programs and depart-
ments. The reduction would cut $4 
billion from the amount formerly 
guaranteed by Proposition 98, a 
number equivalent to approximately 
$800 per year for each California 
public school student. 

The San Diego Unified School 
District has already felt the effects 

of Schwarzenegger’s proposal, issuing 
over 900 pink slips since February in 
an attempt to curb its budget by $80 
million. 

Additionally, the statewide col-
lege preparatory classes — such 
as Advanced Placement and 
International Baccalaureate courses 
— are in danger of elimination, along 
with various other extracurricular 
programs.

UC Faculty Members Claim 
Guggenheim Fellowships

The University of California  
received more Guggenheim 
Fellowships this year than any 
other college system, with 18 of 
its researchers honored for their 
accomplishments.

The John Simon Guggenheim 
Memorial Foundation donated $8.2 
million in grants to 190 artists, 
scholars and scientists from a pool 
of more than 2,600 applicants in 
the United States and Canada. The 
foundation, based in New York, has 
awarded over $265 million in fel-
lowships to approximately 16,500 
individuals since 1925. 

UCSD’s Rae Armantrout, a 
professor of literature, and Jason 
Yuan, a professor of medicine, were 
among the recipients announced 
last week. 

Grants are given for a minimum 
of six months and a maximum 
of 12 months. The average grant 
presented this year to Guggenheim 
fellows is $43,000. 

Stem Cell Research May 
Treat Rare Blood Disorder

Researchers from UCSD, the 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the 
Mayo Clinic and TargeGen, a San 
Diego pharmaceutical company, 
have joined together to perform 
human clinical trials of a new drug to 
treat a rare class of blood diseases. 

In one year, the partnership has 
moved from identifying the appro-
priate drug candidate to perform-
ing clinical trials in order to fight a 
number of Myeloproliferative disor-

ders that are caused by the same 
genetic mutation and can lead to 
leukemia. The degenerative blood 
disorder affects more than 100,000 
Americans. 

The study was led by Catriona 
Jamieson, assistant professor of 
medicine and director for stem cell 
research at the Rebecca and John 
Moores Cancer Center, and fund-
ed by the California Institute for 
Regenerative Medicine.

Scripps Offers Chance to 
Name Ocean Species
Responding to severe budget 

cuts over the past several years, 
UCSD’s Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography is introducing an 
opportunity to support its ocean-
ographic collections by allowing 
donors to name newly discovered 
marine life. 

The institution houses many 
of the most important libraries of 
ocean specimens in the world, 
and scientists worldwide refer-
ence the Scripps Oceanographic 
Collections. Collections staff and 
researchers discover new species 
of marine creatures every year.

Names selected by donors will 
be introduced in scientific publica-
tions that permanently establish the 
new species. There are currently 
several organisms in the collections 
available for naming, starting at 
$5,000. Donors will also receive a 
framed print of their species along 
with a copy of the subsequent sci-
entific publication. 

Funds raised will be used to 
help maintain and expand the col-
lections for future generations of 
scientists.

Surgeons from UCSD Medical 
Center were recently the first in the 
nation to remove a diseased appendix 
via a patient’s mouth and a patient’s 
vagina, minimizing scars and pain.

In the procedure, Natural Orifice 
Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery, 
instruments required to remove dis-
eased organs like the appendix and 
gall bladder are passed through a natu-
ral orifice, such as the mouth or the 
vagina. Only a small, two-millimeter 
incision is required to insert a camera 
into the abdominal cavity. 

Since this type of procedure does 
not require a large external incision 
through the abdomen, patients will 
suffer less postoperative pain and 
recover faster. 

A team of surgeons from the 
UCSD Center for the Future of 
Surgery — including Director 
Santiago Horgan and Mark A. 
Talamini, the chair of the department 
of surgery at the medical center — 
has been performing the technique 
on a trial basis. UCSD’s Institutional 
Review Board, which is in charge of 
clinical research, has approved this 
procedure for a limited number of 
patients through what Talamini calls 
a “rigorous” process. 

“Imagine a day when surgery 
requires no incisions or just one tiny 
incision that is only millimeters in 
length,” Talamini said in a statement. 
“Scarless, painless techniques are what 
the UCSD Center for the Future of 
Surgery is setting the stage for right 
this minute. Patients deserve it.” 

Horgan, who has performed 14 of 
these minimally invasive surgeries, is 
also the president of the Minimally 
Invasive Robotics Association and 
advocates a close partnership with bio-
technology companies to develop the 
instruments needed for these advanced 
procedures. 

Patients are carefully selected for 
the procedure so surgeons can get the 
best possible results. 

“We have a carefully crafted 
approved protocol that delineates who 
is a candidate, and who isn’t,” Talamini 
wrote in an e-mail. “Based upon those 
criteria, we approach patients in our 

clinics and in the emergency depart-
ment with this new approach as an 
option. An important aspect to this early 
work is that we can easily and quickly 
move to the traditional approach dur-
ing the operation if necessary.”

In the most recent surgery, sur-
geons removed a diseased appendix 
from Diana Schlamadinger, a third-
year doctoral candidate in chemistry at 
UCSD, using the N.O.T.E.S. procedure 
through her vagina. This was an emer-
gency procedure, so Schlamadinger 
had only two hours before surgery 
to decide whether she should use the 
N.O.T.E.S. procedure.

“The surgery appealed to me 
because the work I do every day relates 
to science research and discovery,” 

Schlamadinger said. “I understand 
the need for these trials to provide 
patients new information and new 
procedures.”

According to Schlamadinger, the 
risks of this trial procedure are about 
the same as the traditional method 
of appendix removal. For both, the 
greatest risk is postoperation infec-
tions, which have not troubled 
Schlamadinger.

Overall, Schlamadinger is satisfied 
with the results. She reported her pain 
as a “one-half to one” on the pain scale, 
which ranges from zero to 10. 

 “I had never had a surgery before, 
so I wasn’t sure what kind of pain to 
expect,” Schlamadinger said. “My doc-
tors tell me my recovery has been very 
fast, however.”

 She said her stomach pain abated 
after four days and she stopped taking 
painkillers within two days of return-
ing from the hospital. Within six days, 
Schlamadinger returned to work.

“I am indeed happy that I had 
the minimally invasive technique 
because of the speed of the recovery 
and because of the chance to make a 
difference in medical science,” she said. 
“Lastly, I am happy to have no scars on 
my stomach, just a tiny incision they 
made in my belly button for a two-mil-
limeter camera.” 

Talamini is confident that the meth-
od will become increasingly precise. 

“In the future, the tools that are 
being developed for this will also be 
useful for removing pieces of tissue 
from inside organs, rather than remov-
ing whole large segments of organs,” he 
said in an e-mail.

UCSD Medical Center has also 
recently performed a first-of-its-
kind appendectomy via the mouth. 
The patient, Jeff Scholz, reported a 
“two” on the pain scale the day after 
surgery.

Council Questions Sports Facilities 
Director on RIMAC Annex Issues

Like the pedals on an exercise bike, the tension at last night’s A.S. Council meeting rose and fell 
repeatedly as councilmembers probed 
an administrator about the merits of the 
RIMAC Annex, which broke ground 
last month and is scheduled to open in 
about a year.

Sports Facilities Director Don 
Chadwick visited the council to “clarify 
the process” that led to the facility’s con-
struction after the council passed an 
amendment last week designed to more 
closely tie the expenditure of student 
fees on any new facility with a student 
advisory board.

The council’s discussion of the 
amendment last 
week was largely 
framed in the con-
text of the annex, 
which some coun-
cilmembers said 
was a misuse of rec-
reational fees, since 
the annex is slated 
to include a cafe and a convenience 
store but not workout equipment.

“It might seem that we didn’t 
take time to consider student input,” 
Chadwick said last night, with Athletic, 
Recreation and Sports Facility Board 
co-Chair Daniel Palay at his side. 
“We’re here to tell you that that is not 
only untrue, [but] it couldn’t be farther 
from the truth.”

According to Chadwick, when 
RIMAC Arena first opened its doors in 
1994, it lacked much of the conference 
room and food service space that was 
called for in the facility’s original plans. 
The annex, which will incur an estimat-
ed $8.6 million in construction costs, 
will rectify the deficiencies, he said.

At issue was the use of student recre-
ational fees to finance the facility’s con-
struction. What ensued after Chadwick’s 
introduction was nearly two hours of 
semantics warfare, which led the par-

ticipants to inconclusively confront the 
definition of “recreation.”

Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Long Pham bemoaned the use 
of the fees to build socializing space 
and said that a fee reduction would be a 
wiser use of the funds used to construct 
the annex.

“I view the cafe and the convenience 
store as being supportive of our mission 
to provide healthy, physically-active life-
styles here on campus,” Chadwick said. 
“We’ve attended a lot of expos about 
how other health stores are structured. 
We plan to have a lot of that kind of 
food featured.”

He continued to say that an activ-
ity room with a 
rotating schedule 
will also allow for 
low-impact exer-
cise such as yoga, 
answering Pham’s 
question about 
the relationship 
between the annex 

and recreation.
Earl Warren College Senator Peter 

Benesch argued that the annex was not 
in keeping with the intent of the refer-
endum that created the recreation fee. 

“When I pay my bill it says ‘rec fee’ 
and that’s building a coffeehouse,” he 
said incredulously. “I think it’s a breach 
of contract.

With rising intensity, he then referred 
to plans for the facility to include alco-
hol service.

“I don’t see how the beer and wine 
and the coffeehouse fits into this,” he 
said.

But Palay noted that some of the 
food service would be contracted out to 
third-party vendors.

“We are building the space,” he said. 
“We’re not putting the keg in there.”

The debate ended unceremoniously 
when the council cut off discussion on 
the matter to move on with its agenda.

and impressive commitment to public 
service and the environment,” Sandoe 
said. “We were looking for a speaker 
that could unite the campus under 
issues that we care about. We wanted 
a person that could inspire graduating

Kennedy, the son of former U.S. 
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, 
has served as an assistant district attor-
ney in New York City and as senior 
attorney for the Natural Resources

group for environmental protection. 
He also founded an organization called 
the Waterkeeper Alliance, an umbrella 
organization for various groups dedi-
cated to water preservation.

Sandoe said Kennedy’s price tag 
— $40,000 plus expenses — fell well 
within the committee’s ideal budget, as 
its members were considering spend-

La Jolla High School Principal 
Dana Shelburne said the loss of these 
programs would likely have adverse 
effects on public school students’ 
chances of college admission.

“Colleges and universities have 
become extremely competitive, and 
admission is based upon a number 
of factors, including success [in] rig-
orous coursework,” he said. “If and 
when AP courses fall to the wayside, 
students will have fewer choices, and 
the fewer the course choices, the 
fewer the opportunities for students 
to demonstrate mastery of that level 
of work.”

Shelburne added that students 
who do go on to college might find 
themselves unprepared for the aca-
demic rigors of higher education. 

“The less challenging the [high 
school] curricula, the less prepared 
students will be for university-level

work, and the less the chance for 
success,” Shelburne said. 

Shelburne drew parallels between 
California’s budget crisis and an 
existing budgetary problem in edu-
cation.

“Small high schools in rural areas 
have dealt with the lack of oppor-
tunity for some time, and students 
who attend those institutions have 
not yet fully determined a way to 
show capacity when course options 
are so limited,” he said.

Democratic legislators have 
voiced opposition to the cuts with 
the support of school groups such as 
the California Teachers Association, 
Education Coalition and Association 
of California School Administrators, 
suggesting alternative methods to 
remedy the shortfall.

The California School Boards 
Association outlined the statewide 
ramifications of the “disastrous” 

plan, which includes 107,000 teach-
er layoffs, increasing class sizes by 
up to 35 percent and eliminating 
all music, art and career techni-
cal education programs. In addition, 
layoffs would extend to encompass 
137,000 bus drivers, janitors, food 
service workers, maintenance work-
ers, nurses and other education sup-
port professionals.

Suggested alternatives include 
asking the state to increase state 
revenues by closing certain tax loop-
holes, increasing fees or raising taxes 
in some different manner.

Schwarzenegger’s proposal 
also seeks to suspend and amend 
Proposition 98, a 1988 amendment to 
the state constitution that established 
a minimal level of funding for public 
schools and community colleges.

ing up to $75,000 to secure a speaker 
that would motivate students and draw 
publicity for the event.

“We wanted this inaugural event 
to be appealing enough to compel stu-
dents to start an annual tradition to 
celebrate all UCSD graduating seniors,” 
Sandoe said.

Other media icons were considered 
for the slot, but many of them fell out of 
the committee’s price range.

“In a dream world Stephen Colbert 
and Jon Stewart would not cost 
$200,000 to come to speak for 20 min-
utes,” Sandoe said.

Several prominent alumni and San 
Diego residents were also considered 
before the group decided on Kennedy, 
she said.

The June 20 ceremony will be 
UCSD’s first all-campus baccalaureate 
since the 1990s, which attracted speak-
ers such as former President Bill Clinton 

and former Speaker of the House of 
Representatives Newt Gingrich.

There will be several student musi-
cal performances following Kennedy’s 
speech, along with a presentation of 
inaugural all-campus awards, fire-
works show and reception that Sandoe 
described as “a classy Bear Garden.”

At this time, the committee is not 
sure whether guests will be allowed to 
attend, but Sandoe said she is exploring 
the issue. Students will be able to obtain 
free tickets to the ceremony at the Price 
Center Box Office.

The ceremony is part of Senior 
Week, an array of events and activi-
ties designed to keep students involved 
during the week-long break between 
the end of Spring Quarter classes and 
the college graduations.

[Student Affairs’] money,” Berg said 
of his rejected proposal. “There is no 
question that the festival will need 
increased funding in the future. Even 
if the event doesn’t change at all next 
year, costs will increase, and we’re 
already beyond our current budget.”

Much of the new costs will pay for 
new security measures, Berg said. In 
past festivals, programmers partnered 
with local authorities and the UCSD 
Police Department, also employing 
undercover officers to patrol campus. 
At the January council meeting, Rue 
agreed with councilmembers who pro-
tested the use of undercover police, 
saying that it promoted backwards 
enforcement of safety.

“[Undercover officers] don’t seem 
like the way we want to police our 
students,” Rue said.

Programmers plan to replace their 
staff of local undercover officers with 
uniformed police from other universi-

the activity fee [the administration] 
is using it for something that is not 
in the spirit of what students voted 
on. The student government should 
have the ability to say ‘Hey, we’re not 
approving your yearly budget for 
this year because it doesn’t mirror 
what students want.’”

The amendment also requires 
that all campus facilities funded by 
student facility fees be attended to 
by an advisory board whose char-
ter conforms to several institution-
al conditions. Among these is the 
requirement that the advisory board 
of any facility which draws over 50 
percent of its funding from student 
fees be chaired by a student repre-
sentative. 

A.S. President Marco Murillo said 
that this aspect of the amendment 
safeguards students against excessive 
administrative influence over facili-
ties funded primarily by student fees. 
He referred to recent controversy 
that arose over the funding of the 
new RIMAC Annex as an example of 
the type of situation that the amend-

Undercover Police Excised from Fest Security
▶ FESTIVAL, from page 1 ties. The change to an upfront policing 

style will encourage safety but will cost 
over $30,000, Berg said. 

In her statement to A.S. President 
Marco Murillo, Highland and Berg, Rue 
said she was “confident that Associate 
Students resources should be able to 
cover this increase [in security].”

Murillo said he was extremely dis-
appointed with Rue’s response,  adding 
that students might have to shoulder 
the festival’s financial load now that 
Student Affairs is not supporting any 
part of the newfound overhead. 

“We had hope this year that admin-
istration would be willing to fund the 
added costs of security, since this is the 
first year the programming undertakes 
a new structure to the event,” Murillo 
said. 

In this week’s elections, students 
will be able to complete a survey ques-
tion on the possible uses for higher 
activity fees, which includes events like 
the Sun God Festival.

Murillo added that although this 
year’s council began with an unexpect-
edly large amount of carryover funds, 
it has already slated the monies for 
other uses, including A.S. Safe Ride, 
the All-Campus Commuter Board, the 
Women’s Commission and the cam-
pus’ Bear Gardens.

“Administrators missed a great 
opportunity to show students they 
are supportive of long-standing tradi-
tions on campus,” Murillo said. “There 
seems to be a fundamental discrepancy 
between the stated goals of the admin-
istration and their actions.”

The programming department had 
attained $30,000 from the A.S. Council 
earlier this quarter. Those funds were 
meant to add flexibility to a tightened 
festival budget, Berg said, which is 
made all the more rigid without sup-
port from Student Affairs.

getting for the number of dollars that 
they’re paying,” Bournoutian said. 

Additionally, one of the amend-
ment’s primary functions is to 
ensure that student governing bod-
ies, including the A.S. Council, are 
able to exercise extensive oversight of 
the funds derived from activity fees. 
Under the terms of the amendment, 
applicable student governing bodies 
now have the authority to conduct an 
annual review to approve the operat-
ing budgets related to these fees.

Bournoutian said that this feature 
of the amendment will ensure that 
activity fee usage promptly react to 
the fluctuating demands of the stu-
dent body.

“What these rules indicate now 
is that these activity fees are still 
going to be up for a yearly budget 
review, so we can see that the stu-
dent interests and what the students 
voted for are still being maintained,” 
Bournoutian said. “Maybe the stu-
dents voted for something, and then 
10 years from now when we look at 

Revision Designed to Safeguard Student Interests
▶ AMENDMENT, from page 1 ment will help to avoid. 

“With the RIMAC Annex, on 
a lot of decisions that were made, 
students weren’t really consulted 
and a lot of things that [the admin-
istration] went ahead with on the 
RIMAC Annex weren’t things that 
were included in the original referen-
dum of the RIMAC facility,” Murillo 
said. “By having the advisory boards 
we’re making sure that the money 
is directly used for the facility and 
the students are consulted about any 
changes or any other steps that might 
be needed.”

In order for the amendment to 
be ratified, four out of the six college 
councils must approve the change. So 
far, only the Revelle College Council 
has brought the amendment up 
for consideration, approving it in a 
unanimous vote yesterday. The other 
college councils are expected to vote 
on the constitutional revision at later 
dates.

The bigger, better Sun God Festival will cost more. And now that administrators 
have turned  away students’ appeals 
for financial support, it will cost us 
a lot more. For a deal that seemed 
too good to true (a bigger, better 
festival at no extra cost?!), the other 
shoe has dropped.

Suspension of disbelief would 
help swallow this year’s Sun God 
saga easier. After sloppy manage-
ment of last year’s festival painfully 
exposed the fact that it had out-
grown its infrastructure, adminis-
trators and students alike united 
to remake the 25-year-old event. 
What emerged from the exhaustive 
review process was a completely 
new festival, reorganized in basic 
layout and curatorial flavor.

The festival would officially 
bring students into the fold, involv-
ing them in any number of stu-
dent-run organization booths or art 
displays. Finally, the foundations 
of community so sorely lacking at 
UCSD would be fused into the cam-
pus’ largest event.

A.S. programmers even went a 
step further to preserve community 
interests by overhauling their secu-
rity tactics. The undercover offi-
cers of past Sun Gods have been a 
truly aversive force; their presence 
at last year’s festival was one part, 
albeit a large one, of the explo-
sive cocktail that ultimately trashed 
programming’s management repu-

tation with stories of incapacitated 
drunks, riotous crowds at entrances 
and overzealous undercover offi-
cers.

To re-establish order this year, 
programmers plan to employ a less 
invasive strategy that utilizes uni-
formed officers from other colleges. 
The hopeful result: a more accom-
modating, work-with-you security 
presence that better accents the new 
festival’s community ideals. The 
catch: it costs twice as much.

Programmers sought as much 
support as possible from nearly 
every campus party available. First 
grabbing $30,000 from the A.S. 
Council in March (the original 
request was heavily tapered down 
after heated debate over adding to 
the event’s already gigantic coffer), 
then, logically, advancing to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue’s doorstep for a helping hand.

It is shameful to see administra-
tors on the sidelines in such a heavy 
student-interest issue; it is plain 
insulting that they are one of the 
few noncontributing parties in the 
new festival. True, programming’s 
$17,000 request may have overshot 
the definition of a “contributing 
party,” but it could have served as 
a small token for Rue to signify a 
more collaborative  campus pres-
ence.

As a party pitching in impor-
tant work in the new festival, the 
University Events Office has been 

the site of creative readjustment. 
Slowly but surely, programmers 
have leaned on UEO for impor-
tant staff needs. The new position 
of A.S./UEO Event Coordinator, 
recently filled by Olivia Tomisia, 
embodies a link between the UEO 
A.S. Programming Office. The job’s 
salary was paid for by the a surpris-
ingly large council carry-forward. 
The A.S. Council is rightly, and 
cautiously, preparing its infrastruc-
ture to handle the bigger, better 
Sun God. It is pouring more funds, 
more staff and more effort into its 
beloved campus event.

But the council is admittedly 
tapped out. And to see Rue offer 
no olive branch speaks ill of future 
student relations.

I’m sure some of you have heard by now that an Oregon man by the name of Thomas Beatie is pregnant. 
Although those of you who don’t know 

about Beatie and his story might be scratch-
ing your heads, let me just say now that, 
yes, there’s a catch. Beatie was born biologi-
cally female, but underwent sexual reassign-
ment procedures — including testosterone 
replacement therapy and chest reconstruc-
tion surgery — many years ago, and is now 
legally recognized as a male. 

He met and fell in love with his wife, 
Nancy, in Hawaii, and she became part of the 
reason he chose to undergo the procedure, 
largely because same-sex marriages are illegal 
in most of the country.

But after trying to start a family, the 
couple found out Nancy was infertile, 
so Thomas — who retained his female 
genitalia — temporarily stopped his hor-
mone therapy, located a sperm donor and 
recruited a team of doctors to help him get 
pregnant. And it worked. His due date is in 
early July.

I have to give a brother credit for stepping 
outside the box. Although let me be the first 
to acknowledge that the parents are ventur-
ing into uncharted territory, and the kid will 
definitely have a few rough spots growing 
up, stories like Beatie’s should inspire people 
to challenge traditional preconceived gender 
roles.

This past weekend, I did just that. I, a bona 
fide male, transformed into a tried-and-true 
lesbian for almost three days in Palm Springs 
at a massive gathering known as Dinah Shore 
Weekend, aka the premier nationwide les-
bian party event. It was glorious.

My transformation didn’t become official 
until we got to our hotel, which was literally 
crawling with women of all varieties (read: 
lipstick to Amazonian). I camped on the 
floor of a sardine-packed room with 12 
amazingly cool chicks, who were surprised to 
see me yet immediately and unconditionally 
welcoming.

And then the madness began. I never 
knew lesbians were so hardcore: naked flip-
cup tournaments in the hallway (not even 
joking), dancing until the wee hours of the 
morning, putting French fries in a passed-
out bull’s pockets (best thing ever, Morgan), 
charging whiskey before noon and sneaking 
into the $80 White Party with nothing more 
than chewing gum and unadulterated deter-
mination.

So let me say to all you ladies, thanks 
for the memories. After having so much 
fun with my sisters this weekend, I wouldn’t 
think twice about becoming a lesbian again. 
And to everyone else out there who hasn’t 
tried stepping out of their comfort zones, do 
it. You won’t be sorry.

ON-CAMPUS — Six years ago, a 
local high school district was faced 
with a frightening dilemma: Should 
officials publicly announce that 
an anonymous source had made 
threats to attack students at one of 
its schools, or would the knowledge 
only incite a post-Columbine panic?

Ultimately, San Diego Unified 
High School District administrators 
erred on the side of caution, let-
ting parents and students know key 
details about the threat and allowing 

them to decide for themselves how 
to proceed. Some students came 
to school that particular day; oth-
ers chose not to, but everyone was 
informed of the potential danger 
and free to weigh the pros and cons 
of sending their children to campus. 
Thankfully, no incident took place 
— but when adeptly handled, a sit-
uation that could have otherwise 
incited panic ended with no mass 
hysteria and no casualties.

Officials at the UCSD Police 
Department found themselves in 
a similar predicament on April 
4, when the San Diego Sheriff ’s 

Department informed them that a 
man named Thai Thanh Dang had 
made threats against an unspeci-
fied San Diego college campus. Even 
though he could not be certain that 
the threats were directed at UCSD, 
Chief of Police Orville King decided 
it would be in students’ best interests 
to keep watch for Dang, especially 
on a campus where it is often all too 
easy to blend in with the crowd.

King’s admirable decision, which 
reflected a surprising trust in the 
maturity and alertness of UCSD 
students, pursued an often-unde-
rutilized resource when it comes 

to police work: the public. Instead 
of believing that knowledge of the 
threats would cause uproar within 
the campus community, King real-
ized that 20,000-plus pairs of eyes 
have the potential to do more than 
merely stare at their reflections 
in the Geisel Library mirrors. By 
opting to treat students as adults 
capable of assisting the officers 
charged with monitoring their safe-
ty, the department made the odds of 
Dang’s eventual apprehension much 
more likely.

SDPD Lt. Sylvester Washington 
told the Guardian that information 

about Dang’s threats was not meant 
to be released to the public because 
the vague nature of the statements 
could have caused widespread anxi-
ety. While Washington’s concerns 
certainly have merit, it is important 
to recall that members of the pub-
lic share the police’s investment in 
keeping their communities safe, and 
often provide crucial information 
to assist law enforcement in appre-
hending suspects.

Just last week, police in 
Bakersfield, Calif., apprehended

Warning: This Ballot Box Could Cost You Money
As students sign on to cast their TritonLink votes in the A.S. Council elections 
this week, they will also be answer-
ing two survey questions. 

But be wary, Tritons. What 
smells and looks like a survey 
on the usage of higher activity 
fees is being talked about as an 
inevitable fee referendum. And by 
the looks of the recently needy 
council, made even more so by 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue’s unwillingness to lend 
financial aid for the new Sun God 
Festival, students are facing the 
herculean task of funding the 
entirety of yet another faltering 
student-interest issue.

We saw the exact same maneu-
ver from administrators unfold last 
year, when they forced students to 
swoop in to save a sickly athletics 
department with a fee referen-
dum. This year, protest erupted 
concerning student oversight of 
RIMAC Annex, a facility funded 
by student fees.

Students lack fundamental con-
trol over their referendum monies, 
a fact that makes this week’s sur-

vey all the more frightening. If 
we register our opinion as to how 
to use higher activity fees, how 
extensive will our control of those 
funds be?

As it stands, students are left in 
the dark for much of referendum 
expenditures. Councilmembers’ 
requests to track the use, or even 
planned use, of last year’s athletics 
referendum have turned up empty. 
Meanwhile, flap over the RIMAC 
Annex has forced councilmem-
bers to ask for a right they should 
have always had: the right to know 
where their money is going.

If a larger festival does end up 
costing students more activity-fee 
money, elements from the A.S. 
Council’s recent amendment must 
accompany it. Without illuminat-
ing the procedures behind refer-
endum funds, students will end up 
with another muddled debacle on 
their hands. 

Students paying more fees 
need to know where those fees are 
being spent. Together, the survey 
questions and amendment makes 
referendum structure more flex-
ible. With the survey, students 

can specifically determine what 
money should be spent on, while 
the amendment ensures that the 
money goes to those areas.

It’s a sad revelation to know 
that students will undoubtedly see 
this year’s survey manifest itself in 
a future referendum. The bleed-
ing of students for funds must 
stop here, or else we could see any 
number of student-related issues 
needing student funds. Will stu-

dents soon have to shoulder other 
slumping nodes of campus such as 
mental health and campus park-
ing? 

The prospect of seeing any 
glimpse of financial danger part-
nered with a student fee referen-
dum is not only scary — it’s costly. 
And administrators need to realize 
that this is a cost to students who 
are already facing rises in college 
registration fees.

Cheap Tactics in Drive to 
Boycott Mexican Tourism

Dear Editor,
I am a Mexican citizen studying 

for my Ph.D. at UCSD. I want to 
express my concern for the publica-
tion of the flyer “Boycott Mexico” by 
Americans United to Halt Tourism 
in Mexico in the Guardian’s March 
31 issue.

First, I acknowledge the liberty of 
speech in this country and the lib-
erty that any U.S. citizen has to spend 
their money on whatever they want. 
However, I want to state that the 
AUHTM flyer manipulates informa-
tion, presents personal opinions and 
lies, giving no proof of any statement 
and promoting cultural stereotypes 
and racial intolerance.

Recall that legal segregation exist-
ed in the United States until 1970. It 
is the responsibility of the Guardian
to verify the information that is pub-
lished in it.

Close-Minded Locals Need 
to Empathize with Homeless
Dear Editor,

Esther Viti’s bench sitting is 
shameful evidence of her arrogance 
and ignorance. Those benches may 
have been donated, but they are 
public space for everyone to use.

I recommend that Viti buy her-
self a one-way bus ticket to New 
Mexico. Her nasty La Jolla bench-
sitting campaign to keep out home-
less people is unbelievably mean 

spirited and a greater embarrass-
ment to our village than any pres-
ence of poor people. 

She is clearly an affluent woman 
who has no clue about the hardships 
of homelessness. She might try to 
sleep on one of those benches for a 
month to see how great a treat they 
are. Or perhaps try to listen to the 
story of a homeless person’s life.

The problem is not loitering, but 
the presence of poverty and home-
lessness in our country. The pres-
ence of poor people is a reminder 
that all is not well in the United 
States. 

It is time San Diego (includ-
ing La Jolla) considers an outstand-
ing program like Bowery Residents’ 
Committee, which has been suc-
cessful in New York City and many 
other cities. The program provides 
homeless people with decent hous-
ing, a support system, counseling 
and, most of all, hope. What a radi-
cal idea!

a convicted murderer who had 
escaped from a Pennsylvania pris-
on in November 2007. Despite a 
nationwide search for the fugitive 
that included FBI agents, the man 
was not discovered until a passerby 
overheard him bragging about being 
featured on the television show 
“America’s Most Wanted.”

Even AMW, despite suffering 
from the unfortunate reality-show 
stigma, has led to the capture of 997 
fugitives since it premiered in 1988. 

While that figure may not seem 
astonishing over a 20-year period, 
that is still almost 1,000 murderers, 
robbers and rapists no longer on the 
streets — certainly a more palatable 
statistic than it would have been 
prior to the public’s involvement. 
And true, seeing the low-budget 
re-enactments of grisly crimes may 
inspire anxiety and fear in some 
viewers, but it also promotes crucial 
vigilance at times when the police 
can’t be everywhere.

Fortunately, neither campus 

threat scenario panned out, as Dang 
was arrested in his home city of 
Sacramento a few days later for 
an alleged probation violation. 
However, the situation has taught 
UCSD a valuable lesson: All of its 
members, not just the police depart-
ment, are vital parts of keeping the 
community safe. The more people 
who take part in this enterprise, the 
better.

J apan is a wild and strange place, Tokyo in particular. Just two weeks ago my good friend Philip (our main Critical 
Hit! columnist) and I flew from Los Angeles 
across the Pacific to celebrate our spring 
break in gamer-nerd Mecca. Although the 
country as a whole embraces gaming as a 
pastime for subway commutes and after-
school arcade showdowns, Tokyo acts as 
the central hub of electric excess — and 
that is where our story takes place. What 
follows is a search for the holy grail of gam-
ing, the Japanese Dream and the legendary 
Pokemon of lore.

After getting 
soaked in a 
t o r r e n t i a l 
d ow np ou r 
trying to 
visit the 
I m p e r i a l 
Palace, we 
d e c i d e d 
to cut our 
sightseeing 
short and 
move some-
where drier, 
pre ferably 
indoors. I 
s u g g e s t e d 
we take the 
metro to 
Akihabara, 
a district in 
Tokyo also 

known by the name Electric Town, where 
otaku (Japanese for uber-geeks) frolic in 
droves. These nerdy kids and man-chil-
dren come in many flavors, ranging from 
the Godzilla toy collector to the quintes-
sential anime hound. However, we were 
more interested in the hardcore gamers, 
and upon exiting the subway we decided to 
begin our search at Japan’s version of Best 
Buy, Yodobashi Camera. 

A giant pair of cartoon eyes painted 

on the exterior of the nine-story build-
ing greeted us as we walked into a store 
showcasing the future of American technol-
ogy, three years from now. Cameras, print-
ers, watches, laptops; there were gadgets 
in all directions, perfectly organized and 
screaming to be played with. The Battle 
Hymn of the Republic (“Glory, glory hal-
lelujah!”) looped over the store speakers, 
all traditional song lyrics replaced with 
a catchy Japanese arrangement that con-
stantly repeated the words “Yodobashi” and 
“Akihabara.” 

Giddy with excitement, we rode the 
escalator round and round until we finally 
stepped onto the sixth floor, the otaku floor. 
An Xbox 360 display looked neglected in the 
corner, its screens turned off and gathering 
dust. Instead, a small group of teenagers 
gathered around the PS3 to try the newly 
released Ryu ga Gotoku 
Kenzan (coming to 
America as Yakuza 3), 
an RPG/fighting epic 
set in the Edo period. 
At the other end of the 
spectrum, Nintendo 
DS and Wii nongames 
had aisles to them-
selves. I glanced at 
the odd box-art and 
found a game for wine 
connoisseurs, some 
language learning 
software, a calligra-
phy game (#1 on the 
charts that week) and, 
of course, Wii Fit in all its gimmicky glory.

Next, we passed through large areas of 
toy models of scantily clad women and giant 
robots, our eyes distracted with perversion 
and nerdage. Two aisles were lined only 
with capsule toy vending machines selling 
encased Nintendo characters and plastic-
food keychains. Another aisle was dedi-
cated to hundreds of miniature Pokemon 
toys. We grabbed handfuls of merchandise 

like greedy children and handed our yen 
to the cashier, bowing in gratitude. Three 
hours in Yodobashi was enough; there was 
more weirdness to be had outside.

Our backpacks bulged with nerdy pur-
chases as we walked down the busy side-
walk toward the local Club Sega, a six-floor 
arcade carrying everything from tricked-

out Virtua Fighter 
5 machines to 
age-old 2D clas-
sics. I bought an 
ice cream and 
watched Phil 
get his ass hand-
ed to him in a 
match of Virtua 
Tennis; in under 
two minutes he 
had lost three 
consecutive sets 
to an unknown 
( p r e s u m a b l y 
Japanese) com-

petitor some-
where in the arcade. We had dishon-
ored our country, so we left — but not 
before spending a few bills on crane 
games with ridiculously cute prizes.

Around the corner from the arcade 
we came across an odd phenomenon 
found only in Japan: the maid cafe. 
In essence, groups of friends and 
young Japanese couples go to a cozy 
restaurant where all of the waitresses 

are dressed up as anime maids. They talk 
with mouse-pitched voices and act just 
like those annoyingly bright-eyed girls in 
many an otaku’s fantasy. We walked into 
the cafe to check it out but were surprised 
to see a line two floors up a stairwell to get 
a table; apparently sexy maids are a big deal 
in Japan. We were too hungry to wait, so 
we took off looking for a place with tasty 
desserts.

As Phil and I sat on an apartment stoop, 
each of us with a portable ice-cream crepe 
in hand (delicious, and oh-so-trendy among 
kids), we pondered the cultural wonders we 
had just seen. The cherry blossoms were 
blooming, there were no clouds in the sky, 
and our week of nerding out had only just 
begun.

10  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2008



THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  11

know the neighboring children and falls in love with 
a nearby waitress, Shlomo begins to make contacts in 
the political underworld in search of the boy’s parents. 
Though the ensuing odd couple antics are predictable, 
the strange mix of Yiddish and Brazilian, synagogues 
and soccer fields, creates a charming narrative.

When the truth of his parents’ exile gets within 
earshot, the community of Jewish elders work hard to 
shield Mauro from the painful truth that his parents 
may already be captured, or much worse. They also 
shield themselves from the harsh political reality around 
them by indulging in their nation’s proudest heritage, 

their football team. Poetically, the story doesn’t con-
demn these people for their escapism; instead it dem-
onstrates how sports unite people. It allows an atypical 
community to bond in a way that might otherwise be 
impossible. Despite their differences, Brazilians and 
Hasidics join together to cheer for their team, and find 
respite, not just diversion, from the frenzy outside their 
doors.

“Year” is a subtle story, and one that’s well told. The 
major dramatic tones may rise from politics — Mauro 
is orphaned by the country’s dictatorship — but as the 
story is told strictly from a child’s perspective, it’s really 
just about soccer, and a boy who misses his parents.

M83
■ Saturdays=Youth
MUTE U.S.

A nthony Gonzales of shoegazetronic project M83 must have a master plan to slowly evolve into My Bloody Valentine, because Saturdays=Youth 
shamelessly nabs more from those reverb rockers’ steez 
than his two past releases ever did.

For example, “Kim & Jessie” evokes such strong deja 
vu that you’d swear it’s a Loveless b-side done by a MBV 
cover band. Everything is in place; the guitar and synth 
tones melting into each other to create a pillow of fuzz, 
the percussion pared down to a simple kick/snare setup 
and the somber falling-asleep vocals.

Of course, the sentimental techno suites are still 
around, albeit toned down and drawn out in excess 
(see closer “Midnight Souls Still Remain”). “Skin of the 
Night” adds wispy feminine vocals to the mix, along 
with even bigger drum hits and textured guitar bom-
bast, reminiscent of British band Lush but with less 
mysterious beauty.

M83’s melodramatic vocal snippets about death 

and emo poetry also make a comeback on the single 
“Graveyard Girl,” proving that sentimental novelties 
can only be effective so many times before they get 
ridiculous.

To be fair, Gonzales’ work has always been perfect 
for nighttime walks with headphones, the buzzing 
pads layered so tall that it’s hard not to stop and soak 
them in. Unfortunately, his new forays into Chemical 
Brothers’ trip-hop on “Couleurs” and lethargic build-
ups on piano ballad “Too Late” never achieve the same 
emotional potency and come across as worn demos 
— practice for the “real” record down the line.

But perhaps M83’s prime has already passed and 
must be acknowledged as such; deep down we knew 
that nothing could ever top the fiery skate intro to 
“Fully Flared.”

R.E.M.
■ Accelerate
WARNER BROS.

T here was a time when R.E.M. was the biggest band in the world. Like so many beloved acts, though, their greatness has since faded, leaving behind only 
fond memories and a few choice singles. The band’s lat-
est effort, however, defies any expectations born from 
this fall from grace, offering a compelling, no-frills 
artistic renewal that harkens to the group’s early days of 
Reagan-era college-rock stardom. 

With Accelerate, R.E.M. makes a graceful return 
to the raw, guitar-driven, unfailingly poetic rock that 
inspired a young Thom Yorke and drove the world’s 
shoe-gazing emo forbearers to start thinking about 
politics. Whereas the band’s disappointing 2004 release 
Around the Sun settled for uninspired synth-nothing-
ness and exceedingly overlaid instrumentals, Accelerate 
represents a reinvented, bare-boned approach to song 
writing that revels in relentlessly paced guitar riffs 
and down-to-earth folk melodies. Everything between 
Monster and now may as well have never existed, so 
seamlessly does the band re-engage with the post-punk 
alt-hero ghosts of its past.

From the moment the distorted guitar chords on 
“Living Well is the Best Revenge” first burst forth and 
Michael Stipe launches into his signature rapid fire 
lyric-belting, all memory of the band’s last commercially 

and artistically failed attempt is forgiven and forgotten. 
The album further gains momentum with “Supernatural 
Superserious,” a purposeful quasi-anthem that features 
thick, overarching guitar chords and deadpan vocals 
complemented by bassist Mike Mills’ soaring back-
ground wail.

Accelerate continues to impress with the mesmer-
izing folk ballad “Until the Day is Done,” and the 
lyrically driven “Hollow Man,” a two-toned number that 
juxtaposes Stipe’s quiet reflection on the loneliness of 
monotony with an ironically upbeat chorus. The album’s 
only low point may be “Houston,” a tedious, melancholy 
drive that alludes to the likes of “Half a World Away” but 
lacks the coherence and purity that fueled that single. 

This album affirms that R.E.M. has far from lost the 
ability to produce amazing music. Guitarist Peter Buck 
still interweaves solid, full-bodied riffs with intensely 
frenetic chord strumming, and Stipe’s lyrics are as 
cryptic and prose-like as ever as he channels the young 
idealist who made apocalypse seem like an awesome 
prospect. Accelerate truly marks the band’s rebirth, and 
is well worth a listen.

Tapes ’n Tapes
■ Walk It Off
BEGGARS XL RECORDING

I f there was anything special about Tapes ’n Tapes debut The Loon, it’s that the album was a fine exercise in hom-age, with the band paying constant tribute to indie greats 
like the Pixies and Pavement. Despite being unoriginal, 
the band never failed to be charming, constantly throwing 
formulaic but catchy melodies and hooks when we least 
expected it. Unfortunately, given the opportunity to craft 
a unique sound and identity for its sophomore effort, the 
only thing the band really manages to do is strip away its 
charm, leaving only the derivative. 

To be honest, the album’s not bad; it’s just not all that 
good either. The biggest problem with Walk It Off is that 
the album is manufactured to produce a sound that’s noth-
ing really special. Ironically, while the increased production 
values certainly make the album more polished, they also 
muddy its sound. For instance, on the track “Headshock,” 
if the band’s intent was to shock its listeners by adding a 
sudden instrumental shift, it certainly does the deed. The 
effect, however, only manages to disrupt the song’s flow, 

leaving listeners disconnected. The same can be said of 
“George Michael,” which incorporates sharp guitar riffs 
slicing through prevailing melodies to create a similarly jar-
ring instrumental interlude.

With that said, the album is certainly not without its 
high points. “La Ruse” is a strong and memorable opener 
that sets the album’s tone, and both “Anvil” and “Lines” 
never cease to be soothing and sensible after a painful trip 
through “Demon’s Apple,” a poorly calculated tonal shift 
that proves only to be boring and arbitrary.

Still, there aren’t enough memorable tracks to validate 
the solidarity of the album. While I understand the diffi-
culty of following up a solid debut, the derivative nature of 
the band never serves a good enough excuse to play Walk It 
Off more than once. If you’re itching for new music, neither 
this album nor this band will help much in scratching it.

The Kooks
■ Konk
ASTRALWERKS

F or those who dread the mainstream monotony of MTV and the like, the Kooks affirm themselves as our guilty indie-pop pleasures with their sophomore album, Konk. 
After topping the charts with infectious hits like “Naïve” 
and “The Way She Moves” in 2006, the Brighton four-piece 
tastefully avoided a sophomore slump with cute love ballads 
in the classic charm of well-tailored — albeit messy-haired 
— blokes.

Although Luke Pritchard’s accent is sometimes incompre-
hensibly thick in “Always Where I Need to Be,” the thought of 
him whispering sweet nothings in our ears like a humming-
bird is enough to send ladies “arse over elbow.”

“One Last Time” is a delightful, yet sad memoir detailing 
the potential tragedies of setting your heart at the mercy of 
an unrequited love. Coupled with delicate acoustic strum-
ming and Pritchard lamenting, “We were lovers in every way/ 
Now I can hardly remember her face,” we can almost plunge 
into the subterranean darkness of a waning love affair and 
experience the interminable nights of tear-soaked pillows and 

snot-infested noses. The song is so beautifully composed that 
we want to hunt down and chastise the vamp who made poor 
Pritchard cry such sorrowful words. 

Although the last track also reveals the curious impris-
onment of a lost love, “Tick of Time” picks a more upbeat 
acoustic rhythm and the song is sprinkled with a lighthearted 
tambourine. The track opens up with an informal jam ses-
sion, Pritchard singing, “Oh honey please, don’t shed no tears/ 
As long as I’m here” before a spurt of laughter in the studio 
breaks the reverie and promises a cheerier sentiment “One 
Last Time.” 

With Konk’s epic debut, the bravado of the emotionally 
savvy and ever-so-dashing Kooks helps us comprehend the 
complexities of a love lapsed in time. So cheers, mate — these 
British rockers will make life a little easier in some of our most 
vulnerable states.

Cloud Cult
■ Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes)
REBEL GROUP

W ith a cellist, violinist and two visual artists, Cloud Cult — a Minnesota-based sextet that laces elec-tronica and folk into its mellow indie vocabulary — 
remains stubbornly and beautifully independent. They’ve 
rejected record-exec offers in favor of releasing albums 
through band-leader Craig Minowa’s own not-for-profit, 
environmentally friendly label on 100-percent post-con-
sumer recycled materials. The group’s newest endeavor, 
Feel Good Ghosts, is carefully simple, delicately distilling 
audible and thematic complexities into a jubilant elixir of 
human experience that seems able to transform even the 
most tenacious sticklers into barefooted kids playing in 
dewy grass. 

On album starter, “No One Said It Would Be Easy,” 
twinkling music-box melodies, computerized robot beats 
and the cult’s cooing (which quickly shifts to urgent, echo-
ing whispers on a throbbing track two, “Everybody Here is 
a Cloud”) coalesce. Later, the same peaceful, childlike vocals 

meet a triumphantly uplifting orchestral soundscape taking 
whimsical flight on “Journey of the Featherless.” And while 
ditties like these make for carefree lemonade sipping, the 
band’s curious innocence melts away on songs like “The 
Ghost Inside Our House,” a thoughtful reflection on loss 
and growing old. Still, tracks like “Story of the Grandson 
of Jesus” pick up again, remaining sweetly glass-is-half-full 
(“Do unto yourself as you do unto your neighbor/ It’s not an 
eye for an eye it’s a favor for a favor”).

Ghosts isn’t flawless — too-easy tracks “May Your 
Hearts Stay Strong” and “The Will of a Volcano” dance 
uncomfortably near to fizzling flavor-of-the-week pop 
moments — but it is refreshingly honest, rejoicing in the 
spirit of life. So turn up the volume, take off your shoes 
and let loose. It is springtime, after all.

Guilty Simpson
■ Ode to the Ghetto
STONES THROW

F or the past year Guilty Simpson has been warning us that his Stones Throw debut, Ode to the Ghetto, would be 
more than just a collection of MC brag-
gadocio and hard raps; instead it would 
deliver a more complex and fleshed-out 
idea of who the rapper is. Usually the 
response to a rapper claiming to have a 
well-rounded album is extreme skepti-
cism, but after a few listens to the LP, 
Guilty proved to be good on his word. 

Detroit as a whole has been not-so-
quietly running shit in hip-hop for the 
last few years and Guilty’s LP is in line to 
keep that going. The album’s best qual-
ity is that while Guilty explores different 
themes and topics than what he’s been 
known for in the past, he never seems to 
stretch himself too thin. 

He is as comfortable letting you know 
how he’d rob you in the aptly titled 
“Robbery,” as he is when he’s speaking 
of police brutality in “Pigs” or crazy 
girlfriends in “I Must Love You.” Guilt’s 

methodical flow is on point all through 
the LP and the production follows suit.

His Detroit family is very visible as 
Black Milk and Mr. Porter are featured 
on almost half the album. Madlib and Oh 
No also have some crazy beats that suit 
Guilty, especially Oh No’s “Footwork.”

The one gripe people are bound to 
have with the album: the lack of Dilla 
beats. There is only one Dilla track on 
the album, but Guilty addressed this issue 
and mentioned that those tracks will sur-
face in one way or another eventually.

Nitpicking aside, the album is banging 
— simple as that. Guilty is fun as hell to 
listen to and the album is a doper debut 
than most get, and since first impressions 
are everything in the fickle collective 
memory of hip-hop, Guilty is sure to 
make a lasting one. Detroit is definitely 
in the building.

Clinic
■ Do It!
DOMINO

D espite their relative mainstream anonymity, British based Clinic are hardly newcomers to alternative rock with their fifth album, the emphatically titled Do It!. Building 
on the eclectic fusion of disparate genres and sounds that pro-
duce the group’s current label-defying reputation, Do It! deliv-
ers inscrutably catchy tracks that have prompted widespread 
critical praise and a modest but passionate cult of listeners. 
Incorporating everything from smooth electric guitar riffs 
and pounding beats to bursts of synthesizer, Do It! is pleasing 
to the ear, if puzzling to comprehend.

The first track, “Memories,” is a microcosm of the album, oscil-
lating between a generic guitar riff and an eerie series of chimes. The 

tones mix with airy, accented vocals, presenting an absolute depar-
ture from the ubiquitous lyrics that characterize most indie bands. 
Off-kilter notes from trademark vintage keyboards and organs 
(contributing to their retro sound) initially detract from the fluid-
ity, but their seemingly random insertion eventually subsides into a 
dreamy, flowing fluency, a composition of organized chaos. Contrast 
pervades, with tracks smoothly segueing from gritty and thumping 
to calm and meandering, with the often fast-paced instruments a foil 
to the lyrics’ softer tones.

The album is tight and concise with 11 tracks clocking in 
at just over 30 minutes, inflicting only a mild case of musical 
fatigue that might otherwise result from the repetitive rehash of 

the same basic framework. Clinic’s chief problem is a frequent 
imitation of self; they need to vary their style more and dig into 
further, unexplored territory. 

Clinic offers a sound that refrains from the overwhelming 
musical cacophony of contemporary alternative rock, instead 
favoring a calmer and more accessible style. While this origi-
nality has rendered widespread success elusive for Clinic, it 
is refreshing for a band to shun the formulaic playbook and 
attempt to write its own.

Cut Copy
■ In Ghost Colours
MODULAR INTERSCOPE

B orrowing the best elements of ’80s new-wave synth and breeding them with pulsing guitar riffs and ethereal, crooning vocals, 
Australian electronica trio Cut Copy’s sophomore 
album, In Ghost Colours, finds a comfortable 
home for itself in that narrowly defined intertidal 
zone between the electro-rock and club genres, 
save a few stubborn barnacles that keep you from 
fully wetting your feet.

Riding the wave of success from the band’s 
2004 release Bright Like Neon Love, which saw lots 
of airtime Down Under, racked up a loyal stateside 
clubgoer fan base and spawned enough pulsating 
remixes to keep even the most reluctant hipsters 
shaking their asses, In Ghost Colours moves away 
from the safe confines of the band’s previous 
synth-heavy midtempo beatlines. Instead, the 
threesome alternate  between clubbed-out dance 
anthems perfect for head-pounding ravers and 
experimental forays into the softer New Order-
esque world of electro-rock.

Opener “Feel the Love,” with annoyingly sac-
charine oohing and ahhing flanked by repetitive 
and distorted digitized vocals that seem more 

appropriate for the latest boy band, is definitely 
the first of a few noticeable weak points on the 
album, but don’t let it deter you from sampling 
the rest the trio have to offer.

Rather, Cut Copy is most successful when 
they focus their energy on either end of the spec-
trum, via the synth-heavy beatlines of club tracks 
like “Hearts on Fire” or the propulsive riffage of 
slower cuts like “Midnight Runner.” The album’s 
best song is definitely “Far Away,” an amalga-
mation of amped-up dance beats with a catchy 
chorus, while the most disappointing track is 
“So Haunted,” which starts out as a foot-tapper 
but quickly dissolves once the lyrics (“Satellites, 
satellites, satellites / Orbiting you and me!”) enter 
the picture.

Although the ooh/ahh factor is distractingly 
present in many of the tracks on In Ghost Colours, 
Cut Copy deserve credit for venturing out of 
their club-beat shell while also giving a few well-
executed nods to their trademark thumping elec-
tro past.

THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

a team that extended its undefeated 
streak to 16 when they beat UCSD 8-1.

“They’re a tough team,” junior Kaz 
Negishi said. “Their lineup is full of 
players that have a complete game 
where you can’t attack them anywhere. 
It was our first match following a long 
trip, and we weren’t in a groove as a 
team yet. I’m just glad we don’t have to 
see them again.”

Next up for UCSD was Valdosta 
State University, the second ranked 
team in Division II. This time around 
the Tritons handled themselves much 
better, losing 6-3. Steidlmayer resorted 
to breaking up his highly successful 
doubles team of seniors Eric Rubens 
and Blake Meister, using Rubens with 
sophomore Alex Placek at the top spot 
and pairing Meister with Negishi at 
No. 3. Placek and Rubens put up a 
fight, losing 9-8. Meister and Negishi, 
were impressive in taking out Otto 
Lenhart and Michael Luech by a 8-3 
margin. 

“Coach thought breaking us up 
would be best for the team to try 
and gain an early edge in doubles,” 
Meister said. “Those matches are so 
crucial in getting some momentum 
because they happen before singles 
play starts.”

After earning a 2-1 edge in doubles, 

the Tritons stumbled in singles, win-
ning only one match when sopho-
more Bijan Moallemi’s opponent, Joerg 
Ekkenga, retired after only two games.

The Tritons’ tough trip continued 
when they took on No. 27 Columbus 
State University. Entering as the favor-
ite, UCSD lost 5-3, dropping two three-
set singles matches that proved to be 
the difference. In a heated match at the 
top singles spot, Frank Suarez outlasted 
Moallemi 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, while Brandon 
Low lost 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 at No. 6.

In the second half of the double-
header, the Tritons bounced back to 
win their first and only match of the 
Jamboree, beating Lindsey Wilson 
College. UCSD set the tone early, 
jumping out to a 3-0 lead with a 
revamped doubles lineup. UCSD won 
matches 8-4, 8-2 and 8-3 at the one, 
two and three spots, respectively. The 
Tritons held their own in singles, 
winning four of six to clinch a 7-2 
victory. Rubens, Placek and sopho-
more Brandon Low were victorious 
in three-set singles matches.

The Tritons’ final match in 
Alabama came against No. 4 West 
Florida. The Tritons fell behind early, 
losing all three doubles matches, but 
made things very interesting in sin-
gles before losing 6-3. 

Despite being down 0-3 after dou-

bles, UCSD played inspired singles 
matches and had chances to claim 
an improbable comeback victory. 
Moallemi and Meister cruised to easy 
victories, cutting the deficit to 2-3. The 
last three matches on court would all go 
the distance, with two needing a third 
set tiebreak to settle the match. The 
Tritons split the two matches that went 
to final set tiebreaks; Negishi won his 
match at No. 4 singles, while Placek lost 
a tough one after winning the first set.

Since returning home, UCSD 
has hosted its last two home matches 
of the season. The Tritons’ first was 
widely considered the year’s premier 
home game, with No. 10 Hawaii Pacific 
University coming to test the Tritons 
on the North Courts. UCSD lost 7-2, 
falling behind after losing two doubles 
matches, and the Tritons couldn’t catch 
up in singles, where they lost five of six. 

UCSD’s final home match came 
against Cal Baptist University on April 
8. After taking an early 2-1 lead after 
doubles, the Tritons failed to shut the 
door in singles, losing the match 5-4.

The Tritons have two regular sea-
son games left against Sonoma State 
University and UC Davis before the 
West Regional, which starts on May 8.

members of the dynamic pitching staff 
who have not always been given the 
run support that they need, maintain-
ing a positive outlook keeps the faith in 
their offense’s imminent breakthrough. 

“As an offense, we go out there 
every game trying to push as many 
runs across as possible,” Chastain said. 
“When playoffs roll around, we aren’t 
going to change our strategy; we go up 
to the plate looking to hit the ball hard 
and score runs every inning and as a 
pitching staff it’s our job to make those 
runs hold up.”

Game three saw the normally 
immaculate Triton defense make two 
crucial errors that led to two unearned 
runs and a heartbreaking 2-1 loss. Ward 
again threw a solid complete game, but 
a shaky defense and an offense that 
only provided a first inning RBI single 
from junior outfielder Allison May 
doomed UCSD. 

Sensing the importance of the series 
finale, the Tritons scored in each of the 
first three innings to pace themselves 
to a 6-4 win that proved their ability 
to bounce back from their previously 
disappointing games. UCSD jumped 
out to an early lead with back-to-back-

to-back first inning hits from Woofter, 
junior first baseman Jenni Habib and 
May. Freshman outfielder Katrin 
Gabriel provided a clutch two-out, two-
RBI single up the middle in the bottom 
of the second and Maze completed the 
early scoring by driving a third inning 
pitch over the centerfield wall for her 
second homer in as many days.

A series split might not have been 
optimal, but the weekend’s nail-biting 
games gave UCSD something that a 
mere “W” could not: the ability to 
overcome failures and grow as a team. 
The weekend intensity will be put to 
the test when the Tritons next travel 
north to play the No. 7 Humboldt State 
Lumberjacks with conference playoffs 
two weeks further down the road.

“As a team I feel we are ready for 
the postseason,” Woofter said. “We 
are ready for this weekend against 
Humboldt. It is going to be an exciting 
series and our team is working hard to 
prepare for the games. We need to just 
play with confidence and know that we 
are the top team because that’s when we 
play our best.”

apiece with an upcoming tiebreaker 
needed to settle the third doubles con-
test, UCSD lost 9-8 in the rubber match 
for the second day in a row. 

Instead of hanging their heads after 
another difficult loss, the Tritons were 
able to flip the script in singles. UCSD 
won two huge matches in third set tie-
breaks, which turned out to be the dif-
ference. Dao managed to overcome a 
huge deficit in beating Vicky Machaud 
1-6, 6-4, (10-3) in No. 3 singles. After 

getting the decisive break of serve in 
the second set, Dao began playing with 
more confidence and left no doubt in 
the third set. 

After struggling to get anything 
going in losing the first set 6-0 in No. 4 
singles, Fonte fought back in a stirring 
reversal of fortune. She won the second 
set 6-2, and then won a back-and-forth 
tiebreaker 13-11. The clutch victories 
helped seal the deal on a 5-4 win.

The victory left the Tritons drained 
when they played Lindsey Wilson 

College in the day’s second match. 
UCSD grabbed a 2-1 lead in doubles 
but tired in singles to lose the match. 

In their last match on March 29, No. 
18 University of West Florida proved 
too much for the Tritons, beating them 
7-2. West Florida jumped on UCSD 
early, winning the three doubles match-
es by a combined score of 24-4. 

In singles, Perelman and Tang man-
aged to give Tritons their two points of 
the match with victories. Perelman’s 
came in a tense three setter where she 

held off Paola Arevalo 6-4, 3-6, (10-8).
Since then, the Tritons have con-

tinued their dominance in conference, 
beating Cal State San Bernardino 8-1 
and Sonoma State University 9-0. The 
wins extended UCSD’s run of consecu-
tive wins in conference play to 46.

In their most recent match, UCSD 
took on No. 17 Hawaii Pacific University 
on April 6. The match was a compelling 
one, with the Tritons falling just short 
5-4. The two teams split the singles 
matches, with the key match coming 

at the fifth spot. Hawaii Pacific’s Tinka 
Mihova managed to come from behind 
to defeat Sullens by a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, a 
match that proved to be the difference. 

UCSD has three matches left in the 
regular season, two at home, first host-
ing Concordia University on April 10, 
then finishing the season with confer-
ence games against Cal Poly Pomona 
and Cal State Los Angeles.

UCSD in Second After Series Win TRITON MEN 
STRUGGLE WITH 

TOUGH SCHEDULE
By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

MEN’S TENNIS — With the NCAA 
tournament near, the Tritons have pre-
pared themselves with a grueling set of 
matches down the stretch. Head coach 
Eric Steidlmayer expects the challeng-
ing set of opponents to help his team 
peak in the postseason. 

“Our team really needs some com-
petitive matches to properly under-
stand what kind of effort it takes to 
be successful,” he said. “We’ve made it 
a priority to schedule matches against 
teams in other divisions ... so that our 
guys will be prepared for the type of 
quality teams we will see.”

With that in mind, the Tritons have 
been a busy bunch over the last two 
weeks. It’s been a tough stretch that has 
seen the team go 1-6 to fall to 9-10 for 
the year. But in fairness, the stretch has 
featured some truly imposing oppo-
nents. Over spring break, the Tritons 
traveled to Montgomery, Ala. for the 
Blue/Gray Jamboree. Over a four-
day stretch from March 26 through 
March 29, UCSD played five match-
es, including games against top-five 
schools University of West Florida and 
Valdosta State University. The road trip 
also featured a match against National 
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
powerhouse Auburn University at 
Montgomery, hosts of the event and

BASEBALL — In their penultimate 
conference road series of the season, 
the Tritons looked just like the team 
that has climbed the rankings to No. 
12 in the past few weeks in three of the 
games, but was shutout in another to 
finish the four-game series with three 
wins over Cal State Stanislaus on April 
4 through April 6. With the wins, 
UCSD is now 31-8 overall and 15-5 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, good enough for second 
place in the competitive conference. 

In the series opener on April 4, 
senior first baseman Chris Franco led 
the Tritons to a 9-6 win by going 3-for-
5 with two home runs and six RBIs. 
The win was UCSD’s eighth straight, 
but the streak was jeopardized as the 
Tritons found themselves down 6-3 
after four innings. However, a four-
run fifth inning gave UCSD the lead 
and a two-run ninth inning padded it 
before senior closer Keith Noe came 
in to pitch the bottom of the ninth and 
earned the save, his eighth of the year, 
tying the single-season school record.

“When Keith takes the mound at 
the end of the ballgame and we have a 
lead, in all seriousness, everyone feels 
like we have a ‘W,’” head coach Dan 
O’Brien said.

The first game of a doubleheader 
on April 5 did not go as well, with the 
Tritons getting shut out on their way 
to ending a win streak and suffering 
only their second road loss of the 
year. Warrior senior pitcher Marquis 
Fleming went the distance and pitched 
a one-hit gem, walking only one Triton 
while striking out nine.

On the other side, UCSD fresh-

man Guido Knudson pitched well but 
allowed two solo home runs in the third 
inning and was chased from the mound 
in a disastrous eighth inning after sur-
rendering an unearned run. UCSD 
ended up allowing four unearned runs 
en route to the tough 7-0 loss.

UCSD bounced right back, how-
ever, in the nightcap with a 5-2 victory. 
The Tritons got a stellar performance 
from sophomore Matt Rossman, who 
only went five innings but allowed 
only one earned run in that span 
and struck out 11 Warriors. Rossman 
picked up the win to improve to 7-2 
and Noe came in and pitched 1.2 
innings to claim the single-season 
saves record for himself with his ninth 
of the year.

“It’s more important to me to know 
that we’re winning games,” I’m getting 
the ball with the lead. It’s easy to pitch 
when you have a lead and you only 
have to come in for one inning. I really 
wasn’t worried about [the closer role]; 
I want to get a national championship. 
And if in the process I’m getting saves 
and I’m doing what I’m supposed to 
do then that’s fine.”

After being called upon in back-
to-back days, Noe got a well-deserved 
rest as the Tritons had no need for 
their closer in a 13-2 blowout win in 
the series finale on April 6. The teams 
battled for three scoreless innings 
before the Tritons struck in the fourth 
with 10 runs on eight hits.

Thanks to his offense, junior start-
ing pitcher Trevor Decker had a cush-
ion to work with and shined, not even 
allowing a hit until the fifth inning. 
Decker stayed on the hill for seven 
innings and allowed only one run on 
three hits and three walks. With his 
quality start, Decker picked up his 

fourth win of the year and the 20th of 
his collegiate career, making him only 
the seventh Triton in program history 
to reach the milestone.

“On paper we were playing the best 
team we’ve played all year and that’s 
when Trevor’s at his best,” O’Brien 
said. “And I think that says a lot about 
Trevor.”

Now sitting in second in their 

league, the Tritons will face two CCAA 
rivals in two series at home over the 
next two weekends. UCSD will take 
on No. 15 Chico State University 
before hosting first-place and second-
ranked Sonoma State University for 
four games starting on April 18.

Tritons En Route to Fifth 
Straight Conference Title
By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S TENNIS — Head coach 
Liz LaPlante has said throughout the 
season that her team’s incredible depth 
will inevitably make her players stron-
ger as the season progresses. 

“Having so many options makes 
practice more spirited, and that inten-
sity will translate to matches,” LaPlante 
said.

The Tritons have topped the rest 
of the California Collegiate Athletics 
Association for four consecutive years, 
and with this deep group maturing fast, 
it looks almost inevitable that the streak 
will be extended for another year.

After starting the season with 
unknown players, LaPlante has 
watched her squad evolve into a 
nationally ranked team as the West 
Regional approaches. Like the men’s 
team, LaPlante led her lady Tritons to 
Alabama for the Blue/Gray Jamboree 
from March 26 to March 29. The com-
petition in the Midwest gave the team 
a much-needed litmus test before the 
postseason.

In the Tritons’ opening con-
test, they matched up with the hosts, 
Alabama University at Montgomery. 
The Tritons lost 9-0, with UCSD’s best 
result coming in singles from No. 6 
senior Molly Sullens, who lost 7-5, 6-
1. In the other five singles matches, 
Alabama Montgomery dropped a mere 
13 games, demonstrating their strength 
as a team. 

“Having our girls play against a 
team like this is a great experience, 
especially for the younger players who 
have plenty they can improve on,” she 
said. “They had to work extremely 
hard for each and everything out there, 
and I’m proud of the way they fought, 
regardless of the score.”

The second match of the week 
featured a showdown with No. 12 
Columbus State University on March 
27. Once again, UCSD had difficulty 
picking up any momentum and lost 
6-1; however, the Tritons were much 
more competitive in this one. At No. 
1 doubles, freshmen Natalie Varnay 
and Taskeen Bains got their team going 
with a rousing 8-2 win over Columbus 
State’s top doubles team Agata Polcyn 
and Lindsay Groenewald. Columbus 
State responded and tied the match 
with an 8-2 victory at No. 3 doubles. 

The No. 2 doubles match, featur-
ing Triton freshmen duo Kimmie Dao 
and Valerie Tang taking on Roxana 
Dondera and Gabriela Vasilescu, was 
the match that would break the tie and 
would end up deciding the match as 
a whole. Dondera and Vasilescu man-
aged to make the clutch plays to steal 
a 9-8 win and give Columbus State an 
important 2-1 early lead before singles 
play started. Columbus State quickly 
won four singles matches to clinch the 
tie and the other two matches were 
cancelled because the result of the over-
all match was no longer in doubt.

The Tritons demonstrated their 
resiliency the next day, bouncing back 
to upset Division-I opponent University 
of Texas at El Paso by a 5-4 score on 
March 28. After an 8-3 loss by the 
third doubles team of freshman Dalya 
Perelman and senior Justine Ang Fonte, 
the Tritons responded by winning the 
other two doubles matches, both of 
which were tense, down-to-the-wire 
games. Dao and Tang displayed excep-
tional poise in beating Ximena Fuentes 
and Megan Pritchard 8-6. 

The top doubles match was just as 
compelling. Faced with the familiar 
situation of being knotted at one win

UCSD Salvages Split With Otters
By Jake Blanc
Associate Sports Editor

SOFTBALL — The Tritons survived 
the most intense weekend of the sea-
son on April 4 and 5 against Cal State 
Monterey Bay, salvaging a split in the 
four game series. No. 15 UCSD battled 
back and forth with the visiting Otters 
as tensions grew throughout the series. 
All four games saw some form of late-
game theatrics or game-changing plays, 
including many controversial calls 
from the umpiring staff, one of which 
led to the ejection of head coach Patti 
Gerckens in the series finale. 

Before the Tritons can look ahead 
to the postseason, they will have to 
first go through California Collegiate 
Athletics Association rival and the 
conference’s first-place team Humboldt 
State University. With such a big series 
looming, it would have been easy for 
the Tritons to lose focus against the 
Otters, but they were able to keep their 
composure and grind out a series split. 

“Although we split this weekend 
with [CSUMB], the team was not con-
tent with our performance,” freshman 
shortstop Sarah Woofter said. “We were 
expecting to at least win three out of 
the four games, if not sweep them. As 
a whole we have been struggling with 
consistency up at the plate this whole 
season but it has been our tremendous 
defense and pitching that has allowed 
us to get away with it. This weekend our 
defense was not solid and we did not 
perform the way we have all season.”

Game one of the series saw UCSD 
follow its typical production of stel-
lar starting pitching and timely hitting 
for a 6-0 victory. Senior left-hander 
Melissa Ward threw a two-hit shutout 
for her 13th win and eighth shutout of 
the year. For the first five innings, Ward 
was clinging to a 1-0 lead provided 
by senior third baseman Jenny Maze’s 
fourth inning solo shot, but the offense 
exploded for five sixth-inning runs to 

give Ward the breathing room that she 
has often been denied this season.

In the nightcap, the Triton bats 
couldn’t rescue junior starter Lauren 
Chastain, who allowed only four bas-
erunners all game but took the loss in 
a close 3-2 contest. CSUMB’s Angela 

Cabral handcuffed UCSD for six 
innings before the Tritons were finally 
able to scratch across two runs in the 
bottom of the seventh, but the rally 
fell short. For Chastain, Ward and all
