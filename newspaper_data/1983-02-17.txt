Administrators 
may allow for 
fee surcharge 

By EILEEN MORRIS 
Staff Writer 

We're looking at a $112 fee 
increase come pring quarter, 
$100 for the by now famous 
"one time surcharge," and $12 
for a recreation fee. Students 
are asking themselves, not 
only how they'll come up with 
all that money, but whether or 
not they should have to come 
up with it all. 

Last year students voted to 
asses them elves $12 a 
quarter to pay for the 
Recreational Center currently 
under construction north of 
the Warren Apartments. 
According to Bert Kobyashi of 
the Recreation Department, 
under the terms of the 
agreement drawn up between 
the Associated Students and 
the University, stude nt s 
weren't to be asses ed until 
after completion of the Center. 
Approval for this quarter's 
premature asses ment came 
from the Vice Chancellor's 
office, according to Kobyashi . 
joe Watson, Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affair, was 
unavailable for comment. 
Kobyashi himself is in favor of 
thIs quarter's $12 increase, 
believing it to be the mo t 
economical way of assessing 
st udent s for the center. 

There 's no getting out of the 
$100 surcharge, but UC 
President in a letter to the UC 
Chancellors, expres ed 
concern that the charge is 
"likely to create hard hips for 
orne s tudent ," those 

students not on financial aid. 
The February 9 letter sugge ts 
that indIvidual campuse try 
to "ea e the s ituation ." He 
. ugges ts flexible payment 
sc hedule, leniency in 
assessing late charges, and 
emergency loan . 

Ron Bawker of the Regi st rar 
believes that UCSD can 
become no more lenient 
becau e it' "already the mo t 
lenient campus" in the UC 
system. Fee deadlines are later 
here than at any other 
campus. Bawker says that, as 
in winter quarter, fees will 
probably be accepted up until 
the fourth day of class. 

joe Watson plan to deal 
WIth the hardship the $100 
will ca use "with our present 
proced u res. " Bot h Wa tson and 
Tom Rutt er, Director of 

tudent Financial Services, 
believe that the current 
emergency loan program wi ll 
be su ffi cient to handle the 
demand for loans. Under the 
Emergency Loan Program, 
st udent s have 30 da ys to pay 
their loans back. 

"In e sence, we 're doing the 
sa me things we've always 
done," Rutter says. "We're 
increasing the amount of 
loans, and we've made ure 
that the needy students (those 
on financial aid) are taken care

Late Margaret Mead draws fire 
By MICHAEL BEEDLE 

Staff Writer 
Through most of man's 

recorded history the conscious 
effort to di credit or di sprove 
the theories and postulations 
of great scholars and scientists 
has been a clearly exhibited 
human propen ity . No 
academic discipline has been 
free of this bane. The follower 
of physic know thi to be true 
as the works of Isaac Newton 
were altered by Einstein . The 
psychologists credit Freud 
WIth greatne ' s tor hi ' 
contributions in psychoana· 
lytic theory yet question his 
later works in other fields . The 
point being that the great ness 
of Newton and Freud hasn't 
diminished by any means, now 
shou ld it. Clearly great 
thinkers were not correct in 
100 percent of theIr theories. 
Nevertheless, one finds their 
reverence maintained . 

Currently, another great 
scholar is under fire . This time 
it is Margaret Mead, from the 
field of anthropology . 

In a new book ent it led 
Margaret Mead and Samoa, the 
Makillg (lnd Unmaking of a 

Myth, aut hor Derek Freeman 
writes that Mead' portrayal 
of Samoan culture i marked 
by major errors, and her 
account of the sexual 
behavioral of . Samoans is a 
m ind·boggling contradiction. 
Freeman claims that hIS 
research may be more valid 
because he learned the 
Samoan language and lived 
with a amoan family, while 
Mead's knowledge of that 
language was rudimentary 
a nd she lived with an 
American health officer. 

In defense of the no\\ " 
deceased Mead several POlOt s 
need to be surfaced . The work 
111 amoa was her fi r...,t major 
fieldwork and she did It at age 
2:3. The work in Samoa wa.., 
merely a npple of a larger 
wave destined to sweep the 
face of ant hropologlCal data" 
collection techniques. 
Margaret Mead was an 
innovator. he was a scient 1St 
and a superior manager of 
fIe ldwork implementati()n~ . 
One of Mead's pet heuristical 
paths was a communal 
discussion group held dunng 
fieldwork assignment s . Mead , 

along with her staff of 
ethnographers, linguist, 
biologist., . ociologi ' ts, 
ethnomusicologists, etholo" 
gists, computer experts and 
others, would exchange 
coun 'el from one another 

eeking clanty and under· 
standing. 

Her subsequent data and 
mtuitlOn allowed her to

wIth . thIS program without raising taxes. 

It IS very easy for college students to discuss tax

The Way International 
performs valuable service 
Editor: 

I was disappointed at the 
lack of real information in 
"The On·Campus God" (Feb. 
3). I'm a UCSD graduate in 
sociology who has studied 
cults as a first hand observer, 
and I can attest that the Way 
International doesn't qualify. 
It just doesn't possess the 
characteristics. The negative 
Innuedndo about it is 
unsupported and slanderous. I 
will go a step further and 
recommend this group to 
anyone interested in sound 
Bible scholarship, which is its 
sole focus. 

The whole Bible issue really 
comes down to two questions: 
whether one believes a) in 
God's existence and b) that the 
Bible is the revealed word of 
God . With an open mind. it is 
possible to see how it fits 
together and makes sense. 
This takes study. The Bible is 
not a simple document, nor is 
it easy to understand when 
approached superficially . 

The Way International is 
performing a valuable service 

to many by sharing the fruit of 
40 years of intensive ongoing 
research in th e so urce 
languages. Translation. 
context, idiom , etc. are central 
considerations to meaning. 
The Bible does make sense 
when worked as a whole from 
the inside out, rather than 
piecemeal from the outside in. 
It's astounding what various 
religions (and cults) have done 
to this book and in its name. I 
d~fine religions anthropolo-
gIcally, as human inventions. 
If one accepts God's word not 
as a religion, but as spiritual 
truth. it's great to discover 
what it actually says and how 
it works. 

I can't say this for any other 
group, but after critical 
comparative analysis, I'v~ 
found the Way ministry to be 
dedIcated to integrity and 
accuracy.

Letters to the Editor 

On creating a 
nuclear free world 
Editor: 

There was recently a lot of 
media hype generated over the 
TV novel Windso/Warandthe 
evils that were perpetrated by 
Hitler's Nazis. After s itting in 
front of the TV for so many 
hours like a zombie. I feel 
motivated to create something 
rather than merely observe. 
My concern here is with an 
enemy far more insidious than 
Hitler ever was; the nuclear 
bomb, the faceless angel of 
death. 

Unfortunately, the nuclear 
bomb is not an enemy whose 
attack we see as imminent. 
Most discussion of late has 
centered arou nd how many 
billions of dollars we shou ld 
s pend to build them. I think 
mo t peale are unaware of the 
number of well documented 
instances in which powerful 
men of each country 
possessing nuclear bombs 
have wanted to usea portion of 
their growing stockpi les. 

The ability of men like 
Hitler to wreak havoc in the 
world has depended upon their 
ability to persuade a man to 
physically assault another 
man . Such men have 
perpetrated great tyrannies 
and murdered millions. Yet, 
even evil men only live 60 or 80 
years. Even under the most 
barbarous regImes, there ha ' 
always remained the possi-
bility that a revolution might 
liberate and clear the ground, 
paving the way for 'positive 
change.' 

A nuclear bomb is unlike an 
evi l man. It s nature allows it 
alone to be used to terminate 
all possibility and hope. The 
bomb's ex istence works for 
none and against all. Jt can 

forever poison the soi l which 
nurtures us. These bombs can 
turn the globe into a vast 
desert. 

Perhaps your concern has 
been aroused by recent timuli 
such as: the showing of Hearts 
and Minds on campus. 
exposure to the Winds of War, 
and the recent media attention 
given to the Pale tinian 
massacre and the EI Salvador 
question. r urge you to take 
action. Americans , (even 
idealistic university students) 
on the whole, tend to watch, 
worry, di scus s, and do 
nothing. Don't just wait for 
and bemoan the 'inevitable,' do 
something. 

The nuclear threat is as 
much a part of contemporary 
living as Pac Man and Dallas. 
Don't let your familiarity with 
the threat rob you of your 
sense of outrage. Don 't let it 
deaden your de ire to act. 

It may be impossible to 
create a world that is nuclear 
free in our lifetime . 
Nonetheles , our efforts will 
make us better men and 
women. We can at least reduce 
the level of ang t under which 
we live. 

•• * 
My time is too precious to 

me to spe nd it all worrying 
about the threat of a nuclear 
holocau st o r meltdown. 
Nonetheless, I've found that 
nothing fost ers my sense of 
hope more than my personal 
action. It is important to me 
that [live ina world with hope. 
Undertake some action. Help 
make the world a safer and 
more optimistic place in which 
to live and love.

Research versus teaching: are 
professors choosing the wrong path? 

By MARK P. DIAMOND 
John, a friend of mine, was 

upset. He barged into my room 
muttering <;ome foul language. 
I asked him what was wrong. 
"Well, it was my last class." he 
complained. " My professor 
does n't give a damn about the 
class. We are all gelling 
shafted because he only wants 
to do research." 

.. , too much energy 
devoted towards 
research 

John raised an interesting 
point. As lectures become 
filled to ca paci t y and 
professors are responsible for 
more and more tudents. some 
students are beginning to 
complain that some faculty are 
devoting an inadequate 
amount of time to teaching. 
These students believe that 
too much energy on this 
cam pus is devoted towards 
research - at the expense of 
undergraduate teaching. The 
main point in this issue is 
which should take precedence 
at this university: teaching or 
re earch? 

r asked John why he felt that 
his professor did not devote 
enough time to the class. 
"Wel l. he's in lecture and all." 
John related. "But when r 
went to hIS office hour" to ask 
what happened in lecture - I 
mbsed lecture that day - he 
wouldn't tell me. He saId hI' 
was too busy for people like 
me ... 

John 's case IS tYPIcal. Every 
year the Provost Offices 
receive complalllts about 
faculty members. Yet when 
these complaints are invest 1-
gated, the majority turn out to 
be the students' failure to meet 
the obligations of the class. 

The faculty members on 
this campus take their 
teaching sen ously. They work 
to prepare a lecture and also 
expect the students to work. It 
is painful for a professor to see 
uncaring students. If students 
will not meet them halfway, 
professors will not cater to the 
students. Students like John 
w ho complain about betng 
"short changed" by professors 
u ually are short changing 
themselves. 

I explained thIS to John . 
"O.K.," he asked. "are you 
telling me that every professor 
takes ever, cla..;s verv 

Students who

univerSIties, including lTCSD, 
there are alwav a handful of 
professors who'do not teach as 
well as they should. If a

two roles: the propogation and 
the dissem inatIOn of know-

These two roles complement 
each other. The main rea'Son 
UCSD has high quality

I am not saymg that all

Instead , re earch teaches tlie

The Sun God is art. Those 
who think otherwise fail to 
realize that art is not a static 
medium . Art changes its 
appearance with time by 
always struggling to reach the 
outer bounds of what people 
consider is "art" and cau es 
the viewer to question his own 
definition of art and creativity. 

Beethoven's symphonies 
were once thought of as 

"trash," a nd "the noise of a 
madman" and yet we often use 
his mu s ic today as a means to 
judge the works of newer 
composers. Over time there is 
a gradual growth of humanity 
toward the acceptance of 
something new regardless of 
i I unsettling appearance. 

The quesion is not whether 
the Sun God is art. but 
whether we are all mature 
enough in our thinking to

4 The UCSD Gua rdian Thursd ay, Fe bruary t 7 , 1983 

Compelled to illuminate State legislature is 
Alchohol, a rational means away from roles heading for our throats 
Editor: 

Although the art icle wr itten 
in your paper pertaining to 
"Alchohol Abuse," Feb. 7, was 
extremely well written. I feel 
compelled to illuminate you in 
rega r ding so me didactic 
reasons why many students 
continue to "casually" use 
drugs throughou t the duration 
of thei r college careers. 

Drug use. or "abuse," is a 
socially constructed pheno-
menon cau ed by social 
variable, uch a cramming 
for finals so that one may get 
good grades, concom itantly 
good grades are a necessity in 
order for one to be admitted to 
graduate chool and 0 on ... 

My point is that coll ege 
years are perhaps the most 

);-,.-
\> 

com plex stage of socialization. 
one which a n individual must 
undergo in order to become a 
"contributor" to society. It is a 
time when young people begin 
to conscious ly become aware 
of their socia l environment be 
it in t he classroom. in forming 
relationshi ps. or watching the 
news during supper. 

David Brenner, a sociologist 
at Johns Hopkin . a ' well as 
Ruben Rumbaut of UC San 
Diego, both concur that 
various organizat ional 
problems (i.e. bad grade. 
unemployment . etc.) have 
social ram ification s (i.e.' 
di vorce. alcohol abuse, etc.) 
Thus. that occasional drink at 
a TG on Friday. or that joint 
before bed may be a rational 

means of com part mentalizing 
one's self away from their 
workaday role of a st udent. 

A far as "abuse" goes, this 
depends on the social context 
in which it is used! If, for 
example, a student who works 
twenty hours a week and takes 
ix teen units in school has the 

occasion to "party." then 
whom i someone else to 
denegrate that individual?The 
importance of detecting when 
alcohol (or drug) abuse 
becomes a problem is in being 
able to understand the social 
circumstances in which the 
phenomenon manifests itself. 
not in wantonly propagand-
izing it.

Ideally. we wou ld like to see 

the tax structure flip-f lopped, 
with the majority paid to the 
states. a llowing for greater 
efficiency, sensitivity to 
regional needs, and leaving the 
flabby Feds with only defense 
and other national matters to 
play with. Even when the 
democrats come back into 
power, this trend cou ld be 
continued through the simple 
expedient of blackmail, as was 
thecasewiththe55mph peed 
limit. By law, the Feds cannot 
regulate the speed at which 
their constituency travels. In 
fact, they did so anyway by 
threatening to withold 
highway funds (which are

shared with each state) from 
those states not in "compli-
ance" with their mandate. 

This type of action, while 
morally repulsive. is a positive 
alternative to allowing the 
Feds to breast-feed an ever-
increasing number of 
bureaucracies. [n ba lance. 
then. Governor Deukmejian 
should make a pilgrimage back 
Lo earth and push for enough of 
a tax increase to keep 
California afloat without 
di emboweling the state's 
st udent . Fee increases will 
balance the books. but with 
industry turning increasingly 
towards the higher end of tech . 
we're going to need all the

SDGE awards 
grant to UCSD 
energy project 

By E ILEEN MORRI 
Stuff Writ"r 

San Diego Gas and Electric 
wants to cut your energy bills, 
and no one is complaining, 
least of all UCSD's Energy 
Center. With an SDG and E 
grant of $125,000. the center is 
studying the cost-effective, 
energy-efficient house , trying 
to determine building 
techn iq ues and systems of 
energy conduction and storage 
that wi ll conserve energy and 
uti lize renewable resources. 
such as the sun. 

Each year since 1972. SDG 
and E has awarded thecentera 
similar grant. Says Dr. 
Stanford Penner of AMES, 
founder of thecenLer, SDG and 
E had "been made aware of the 
values of energy con 'erva-
tion." With increa ed 
conservaLion. the energy 
company will have to build 
fewer generating staLion ," 
Penner says. 

AME graduate stude nt 
Eric Kennedy' s s tudy on 
infiltration control ha s, 
according to Penner. "done 
quite a bit of good." Kennedy 
planned and s upervi sed 
sealing wind and water leaks 
in 200 San Diego homes. 
Before and after comparison of 

DG and E bills for these 200 
homes shows significant 
reductions in energy use . 
Whether the improvements 
were cost-effective has yet to 
be determtned . 

Along a simi lar line, 
Profes>;or SeabalL of the 
Center IS ~tudyi ng systems 
management - how besL Lo 
build a house for minimum 
energy usage. Rc<.;earchers are 
experiment ing with insula-
tum solar panels , and different 
hudding materials. Dr . 
Aeerb(mer. and associate 
mem ber of the Center, retired 
from Exxon. IS comparing ~ix 
dIfferent kllldb of \\ ater 
heaters to determine \\'hich i.., 
most efficient. 

Comprised of faculty and 
students - both graduate and 
undergrad - from four 
depart ments. AMES. Physics , 
Economics. and Scripps 
Inst it ute. the Energy Center 
has been in operation si nce 
1972. "We've been official 
since 1974," Penner says. "It 
took the University two years 
to realize that we were her ." 

The Center receives funding 
from a number of other 
so urce!-> . This year they 
received $175,000 from the 
Department of Energy. Most 
of the research done with 
Dept. of Energy monies has to 
do wit h coal. When the Center 
first began. research was done 
on coal liquefaction. that is, 
the transformation of coal 11110 
liquid fuel. Now the center is 
examining new ways to burn 
coal. 

Penner believes coal Lo be an 
overlooked resource in 
America . The Center\ change 
ill focus ahout coal (from 
Ilquldfartion to burning) ha, 
to do \\ IIh a shift III thl'

TIll' \\onl from Washington 

is that technology shoutd be 
developed only to L he pOint 
where it can be used. " If it 
doesn't make se nse for 
industry, it doesn't make 
se nse ." Penner says. lie 
believes our most senous 
problem IS that money isn't 
available for big. inn()\'ative 
programs. 

"In Japan, there's plenty of 
risk capital available." says 
Penner. He believes that the 
cooperatIon between gO\ern-
ment and industry in Japan 
should be imitated here. 

There are four areas that 
have yet to b exploited to their 
fu ll est. according Lo Penner. 
These are shale. tar sands. 
coal, and nuclear power. There 
is four times the amount of oil 
in the Midd le East available in 
t he United Slates' mountains 
in the form of shale. Penner 
believes. but with current

Israeli dig 
continued from page 1 

The official name of the dig 
is the City of David 
A rcheological Project for the 
Excavation, Preservation, and 
Restoration of the City of Da ('id, 
Jerusalem. The director of the 
dig is Dr. Yigal Shiloh, 
professor of archeology at the 
Insitute of Archeology located 
at the Hebrew Univer ity in 
Jerusalem. Dr. Shiloh will 
come to UCSD on March 18 to 
meet the selected volunteer 
and lecture about the project. 

Located on the eastern edge 
of Jerusalem , the City of David 
(so named after King David of 
Biblical fame who conquered 
the Canaanite city from the 
Jebusites in 996 B.C., and in 
tu rn designa ted the ci ty 
capital of the United Kingdom 
of Israel) was the center of 
ancient Jerusalem until it was 
destroyed by the Babylonians, 
who were led by King 
Nebachadnezzar (i n 586 B.C.) 

From the dig site, one can 
look east across the small 
valley of Kidron and see the 
Arab village of Silwan (which 
is supposed to be a close replica 
of how the ancient City of 
David looked). as well as the 
small town of el-Azarhiya (the 
Bethany of Christ's time). To 
the north is the famous "Old 
City" of Jerusalem , with its 
massive walls jutting against 
the skyline. To the south lie 
the Gihon spring and the Pools 
of Siloam, where the Royal 
Gardens of Da vid were 
located. The dig site itself si ts 

,on the western slope of the 
va lley of Kidron 

Excavation on the Cit y of 
David s ite began in J 961 by the 
famous British archeologist 
Dame Kathleen Kenyon. The 
City of David Project began in 
1978. The project was 
cheduled to last five years 

with the final eason planned 
for the summer of 1982 (the 
actual digging season lasts 
two months, July and August 
of each ummer. The 
remaining ten month are 
u ed to identify and categorize 
the major finds of the season). 
Since several important finds 
have been made over the past 
three seasons, Shiloh has 
made the decision to extend 
the project for an additional 
year, with the final digging 
season being the summer of 
1983. 

The most important finds 
occurred this past summer 
when Shiloh and his crew 
found a room containing 53 
"bulim," or seal impressions, 
which dated from the First 
Temple period (600-500 B.C.) 
The stamps were used to 
impress personal sea ls of 
scribes and official on to 
documents. Some of the seals 
contain names that are almost 
identical to names contained 
in the Bible. For example, one 
stamp bears the sea l of 
Gemaryahu, son of Shafan, 
who was a scribe of King 
Yehyakim (ruler of Is rael 
when it was destroyed in 586 
B.C.), and who was also a 
contemporary of the Prophet 
Jeremiah .

time, ten lleSD students were 
gi\en granh of $500 each In 
order to participate on the dig. 

During that 1981 season, the 
dig became a center of political 
controversy in Israel. Ultra-
orthodox Jews (Hassadim) 
claimed the dig site was an 
ancient Jew Ish cemetar~ 
dating from the Cru'>ader 
period , and that it was being 
desecrated by Shiloh and his 
volunteers. The zealot s held 
regular demon tra lions at the 
site itself. After long legal and 
political battles. which nearly 
toppled the coalition govern-
ment of Prime Minister Begin, 
the Israeli Supreme Court 
declared the site could not 
havc been an ancient 
cemetary, and allowed the dig 
to cont inue.

Zero-option may be no ·option 
By JON STEWART 

Pacific New8 Service 
Two critical trends, one in 

Europe and one in America, 
soon will converge in a single, 
do-or-die demand for compro-
mise and agreement on US-
Soviet nuclear arm control. 

In Europe, the zero 
credibility of the Reagan 
administration 's zero option 
proposal makes the need for 
compromise es ential, 
espeCIally after the March 6 
West German federal election. 
And in America, a little noted 
but almost unprecedented 
planned expansion of nuclear 
weapons production could 
dash any hopes for future 
disarmament if it i not 
checked by an agreement very 
soon. 

The failure of the zero 
option proposal to arouse any 
deep support outside France is 
the most immediate obstacle to 
be overcome. Hans-Jochen 
Vogel, the West German Social 
Democratic candidate for 
chancellor and the likely 
winner in next month's 
elections, last month 
"demanded" that the United 

States offer "a constructive 
counter-proposal" to both the 
Soviet position and the zero 
option. 

The Soviet Union has 
offered to reduce it number of 
European missiles to the 
number fielded by Briti hand 
French forces , if the United 
States foregoes deployment of 
the 572 Pershing II and cruise 
missiles in Europe. The US 
plan calls for the dismantling 
of all Soviet intermediate 
range mis iles directed toward 
Europe in exchange f(lr not 
deploying the Per hing II and 
cruise missiles. 

Neither plan is acceptable to 
the opposite side. However, the 
Soviets have evinced a clear 
interest in compromise, 
suggesting in veiled ways that 
their current position is 
negotiable. While the Pershing 
II, with its six-minute strike 
time, remains totally 
unacceptable to them, they 
have indicated they might be 
willing to accept deployment 
of some smaller number of the 
slower cruise mi siles in 
exchange for dismantling an 
un oecified number of their 

formidable SS-20 missiles 
trained on Europe. 

If Vogel doe become the 
next German chancellor, a 
compromise of some sort will 
become mandatory. Other-
wise, the United States will 
stand virtually alone among 
NATO military members on 
the fragile precipice of zero 
option. The Soviets will have 
succeeded in splitting 
European NATO from the 
United State ' (a long-term 
aim), and the Euro-missile 
negotiations in Geneva will 
founder irreparable. 

Such a failure would mean 
much more than merely 
another delay in reaching an 
accord . It could mean a 
permanent failure, for it would 
lock open the floodgate of a 
massive expansion of US 
nuclear arms production - no 
doubt matched by a Soviet 
expan ion - making future 
agreement all the more 
difficult. 

Public concern over the 
future of the nuclear arms race 
is focused narrowly on the MX 
missile and its promised 
Soviet counterpart. But 

beyond the MX is a wide range 
of new nuclear weapons 
approaching the production 
stage or in advanced research . 

According to the forth -
coming Nuclear Weapons Dolo 
Book, by William Arkin, 
Thomas Cochran and Milton 
Hoenig, six new nuclear 
warhead types are in 
production now. But 16 more 
new warhead types are in 
advanced development, three 
of which will be produced in 
1984. Over the next decade, an 
estimated 23,000 new 
warheads of various types will 
be produced, and another 
14,000 are currently in 
development stages for 
production by the mid-1990s. 

The planned warhead 
production ra te for the 1980s 
will nearly double the rate of 
the last decade. Indeed , the 
Department of Energy has had 
to initiate plan for a threefold 
increase in plutonium 
production to meet the 
"nuclear shortages gap" in the 
1990 . 

Concurrently, funds for 
nuclear weapons testing have 
increased 43 percent since 

1981. More nuclear weapons 
were exploded in tests la t 
year than in any year since 
]970. 

What all this means is that 
in the absence of a nuclear 
arms limitation agreement 
soon, ten of thousands of new 
warheads will be tested, rna -
produced and deployed. 

It may be argued that even a 
new agreement to hal t 
development of new weapons 
would not prevent the planned 
increa e in production of 
warheads. But arm control 
experts observe that agree-
ments tend to lead to even 
better agreements. A short-
term accord now could 
stimulate a far more 
comprehensive accord soon, 
perhaps even one which would 
ban nuclear testing. 

Al 0, as Walter Slocombe, 
the former director of the 
Defense Department's SALT 
task force, put it recently: "It 
isn't useful use of re ources-
therefore, very unlikely that 
people will do it - to produce 
sy tern which cannot be 
deployed. " 

In any case, the options 
-----------------------.-------------------------, which the Reagan administra-

The U.S. MARINES will: 
Pay qualified UCSD Students to go 
to Summer Officer Candidate 
School, see if you measure up as a 
Marine Officer, and give you a drop

week seSSIon and prIor to 
graduation). Flight school guarantees 
available for pilot qualified individuals. 
If you are willing to obligate yourself we can pay 
you $900 per year for 3 years. 
The Marines want good students regardless of 
major. We will not interfere with your academic 
or work schedule during the school year. We do 
not require uniforms or drill periods during the

tion publicly is offering now 
are very simple: zero option or 
all-out option. The former, say 
the Europeans, isn't workable; 
the latter, ay arm control 
advocate, is not thinkable. 

But there are thinkable and 
workable alternatives. One 
common-sense plan, known as 
"SALT II and Shrink," has 
been proposed by the 
American Federation of 
Scientists and should appeal to 
the American and European 
"freeze" advocates as well a 
satisfy the demand for 
equality of the US and Soviet 
governments. 

In brief, the proposal would 
begin with the already 
concluded SALT II agreement 
(which officially expired in 
1981), eliminate the right to 
develop one new land-based 
missile system (which was 
provided in SALT II), extend 
the SALT II restriction on 
cruise missiles for two years 
and defer the Pershing II 
deployment in exchange for a 
dramatic reduction of the .. 
Soviet SS-20s and all 
remaining SS-4s and SS-5s. In 
addition, the propo al calls for 
a phased percentage reduction 
of all weapons allowed under 
SALT II to 50 percent of the 
present total. 

[n practical terms, this 
would mean scrapping the MX 
(which already i~ a political 
liabilit y) in exchange for the 
Soviets foregoing production 
of the new land-based mis~ile 
they have been te~ting. It 
would mean at least a t wo·year 
freeze on new nuclear 
weapon~ in Europe along wit h 
reduction of Soviet 'S-20s to 
approximately 1O:~ warheads. 
[t would also bring about 
rough Iy t he same groso., 
reduction in strategic delivery 
vehicles by both sides ascalled 
for in President Reagan's May 
1982 START proposals. 

Since the plan is based on an 
already concluded HI-,'Teement. 
it wou Id a void t he prot ract eel 
negotiations invohecl in 
forging all entirel~ new 
accord .

Henry VIII by Camille Saint-
Saens, is an opera about a messy 
divorce. with royalty. a trial. and 
a blackmail letUer. all In the 
ticket price. It is not about all of 
King Henry's divorces. because 
there are not that many 
sopranos available at any given 
time. 

The San Diego Opera is 
presenting the American 
professional premiere, which 
means that the piece is not an 
operatic warhorse, but which 
also means that it Isn't 
necessarily bad. More than any 
other performing art form, 
opera confines itself to a few 
works by even fewer composer . 
So an opera which isn 't by two 
or three Italians or one or two 
Germans. and in which no one 
die of unnatural causes can be

Vol. 2, No.6 February 17, 1983 

more than a curiosity: it can be 
great. 

Henry VIII is great. but not 
consistently, and this 
performance is the same. The 
work is obviously written by a 
great composer, but in a line-up 
of operas it would be so difficult 
to distinguish that it could just 
as well be wearing false 
whiskers. Salnt-Saens peeks out 
from behind the facade of Grand 
Opera in a few places, usually in 
the overtures and moments of 
titanic emotion - where the 
orchestra and chorus become 
overwhelming parts of the 
music. 

He is, after all most 
important as an orchestral 
composer, one of his most 
famous and, I think, one of hi 
be t pie es "Carnival of the 

Animals." It is worth going to 
this opera just to hear this side 
of Saint-Saens that one has 
probably never heard. or may 
never hear again. 

And of course what is not 
recognizably Saint-Saens is still 
very good as part ofthe operatic 
tradition . A duet between Henry 
and Anne Boleyn in the last 
scene is one I especially 
remember for Its energy and 
grace. These are abstractions 
which might be meaningless -
to compare it to birdsong 
simply sounds trite. 

The production itself also has 
trouble breaking through the 
Grand Opera facade to being a 
good individual production , not 
only part of a tradition. But 
when it doe break through, and 
when it doe take advanta~e ot 

the tradition instead of merely 
existing in it. the result is as 
much worth listening to as that 
of any opera company in the 
country 

The part of King Henry is 
played by Sherrill Milnes, who is 
the world 's most accomplished 
baritone, and is probably the 
greatest actor on the operatic 
stage today (you may have no 
idea how critics hate having to 
fill their paragraphs with 
superlatives, even truthful ones' 
it makes them look like 
aesthetic gluttons). He makes a 
Henry, In voice and face and 
posture, selfish, overbearing 
and having a full knowledge of 
his power and how to 
manipulate people with it. The 
only part of the character which 
lacks subtlety is the limp, which 
is too apparent too much of the 
time. 

Subtlety is important even in 
an art form which has more of 
the grand gesture than Mount 
Rushmore . Economy in 
movement does not mean 
smallness: it means effecti\e-
ness. Some of the most effecti\c 
staging is in the scenes between 
Queen Catherine and Annc, and 
later, I suppose, betw en Queen 
Anne and Catherine. In the first 
of these. two women and a lady-
in-waiting stand each in one 
place forming a diagonal line 
across the tage. through mo t 
of the scene. Yet emotion is 
communicated bettcr than by 
Don Gomez. Anne 's lover. 
leaping and blustering about 
the stage. 

The sets arc large, \\ hich the) 
ne in any opcrJ, but in thiscase 

~hcy lack any idca of Tudor 
space , and little for 
arrangement. One which i 
effective i the Hall of 
Pa r liament (which wa an 
archa ic room at that tim 
anyway). with a beaut iful 
backdrop of the Abbey windows 
in watery colors. Another is 
Catherine's room of exile, with a 
backdrop of large and autumn-
colored symbols of heraldry and 
Christianity. It is not terribly 
Tudor, but it is effective. 

This Friday at 8 pm and 
Sunday at 2 :30 pm are the two 
performances remaining. The 
performance , with two 
intermissions, lasts about three 
hours and ten minutes, which, 
to degrde ourselves to the 
material for a moment. is a lot 
of value for $6.50, the cheapest 
ticket price. or even $25, the 
most expensive. Ticket reveune 
a count for Ie than half orthe 
money it take to put on th 
opera, and that i apparent from 
the performance.

Do not trust "any Anderson with your sister or your waUel 

A liar and a cheat but 
an incredible talent 

By ANDREW KI[lLR 
" From the beginning I've 

been a liar and a cheat. Show 
busi ness seemed inevitable." 
This doesn't sound like your 
average " all -American boy 
makes good " rise to stardom, 
but Hany Anderson is not 
anybody's all-American boy. 
Anderson is not really "all " 
anything. He is part hustler, part 
con man, part magician, part 
comedian and who knows what 
else. 

At 29 Anderson is one of the 
most unique and talented young 
performers on the nightclub 
circuit. Claimed to have been 
" raised by lizards, then 
kidnaped by a band of gypsy 
comedians who held me captive 
in a hotel room in Atlantic 
City ... ," he had a strange 
childhood. 

Anderson was out on the 
streets of San Francisco running 

a shell game by his sixteen! 
birthday. He made his mark or 
Nor t hern California t · 
performing at every frat part 
street corner gathering or stat. 
fa ir he could infiltrate. His bl<' 
break came when fellow offbeat 
comedian Gallagher could no 
open a show for Kenny Roger~ 
and recommended Anderson for 
the spot. 

He has since appeared in the 
main rooms of the Riviera, 
Sands and Silverbird Hotels in 
Las Vegas as well as on most 
major 1V talk shows, The routine 
Anderson is most noted for is 
his "geek" trick he performed 
on Saturday Night Uue. It 
involves sticking a needle 
through his arm. (It has to be 
seen to be believed.) 

Anderson will bring his bag of 
tricks to Mandeville tonight at 8

Tuba concert 
by student 
Tanya Rust 

What do you hear when you 
think of the tuba? Whatever it is, 
tubist Tanya Rust explores all 
possibilities in concert under 
the auspices of the UCSD Music 
Department Performance 
Forum for student performers, 
tonight at 8 pm in Mandeville. 

Do you hear the sound of 
brass in a military band? The 
oom-pah-pah bass line of a 
Strauss waltz? Or the funeral 
sound of a bass horn 
announcing the end of the 
world? Does the instrument cry, 
scream or laugh? In tonight's 
concert Rust explores not only 
the character of the tuba, but 
also its relationship to other 
instruments. 

Assisted by guitarist Brian 
Hays, soprano Andrea tlaines, 
harpist Donna Vaughan, and 
pianist Keith Humble, the tUbist 
will present music by Faure, 
Amato, Ravel, Penn, and Bartok. 
This program, a rather unique 
event, represents the best of the 
sparse music literature written 
for the rather elusive tuba , The 
concert is free. For more 
information call 452-3229. 

Comedy and 
magic tonight 
continued from page 3 
pm when he headlines and

Uving Dangerously 
By CLYDfNf NEE 

If you like Peter Weir films, 
then Th e Year of Living 
Dangerously is one that you 
will really el~oy, This Australian 
director has produced some of 
the most amazing films to come 
from the L3nd Down Under, 
Picnic at flanging Rock, The 
L3st Waue, and Gallipoli. 

Starring Mel Gibson (of Road 
Wanior and Gallipoli fame) and 
Sigourney Weaver (best known 
for her role in Alien) The Yearof 
Jiving Dangerouslylooks at the 
development of a young 

i rarely seen in major motion 
pictures today. 

The film begins with a 
monolog by the film 's principal 
character Billy Kwan , a dwarf-
like Eurasian cameraman, 
played most impressively by 
Unda Hunt. At first you might 
find this character a little 
unsettling, and when you find 
out that the person playing the 
role of this character is a woman 
it might jar your sensibilities, 
but as you become more 
involved with the film so will 
you become more attached to 

Sigourney Weaver plays the 10Yl' 
interest of Mel Gibson ~ 
character Guy tlamilton. The 
length of tIme she is on the 
screen, the dialog she is given, 
and her acting ability make her 
character more of a (ameo rolc 
than a starring one. 

The true love story revolves 
around the friendship that 
exists between Guy Hamilton 
and Billy Kwan. From the 
beginning of the film you watch 
the development of a close bond 
between these two individuals 
who are trying to make it in the 
world of journalism, and being 
in a country that is a hotbed of 
social and political upheaval. 

Star !'lei Ciibson and director Peter Weir discuss a shot on tile set of The Year of Living DangeroUSly. 

reporter during a period of 
upheaval in 1965 Indonesia. 

This film may start a little too 
slowly for most members of the 
audience. At the beginning of 
the film it is so slow that I 
looked at my watch about 45 
minutes into the film wondering 
when it would be over. The last 
half of the film more than makes 
up for its slow beginning, One 
thing that will hold your 
attention is the beauty and 
expertise with which this film 
was made. The cinematography 
is spectacular; almost every 
shot in the film is a work of art, 
and the lighting brought out a 
feeling of depth in the film that 

this character. Billy Kwan, 
though small in stature, is a 
giant among men, and he often 
shows up those around him for 
the hypocrites that they really 
are, He has more compassion 
and sensitivity than those 
normal people around him. 

"It was the furthest thing 
from my mind to cast a woman 
in this role, " Weir relates, "but I 
defy anyone to find a single 
seam in Linda's totally 
convincing performance. No 
one - male or female - could 
be better." 

Though it is billed as a 
romantic adventure, nothing 
co uld be further from the truth . 

Mel Gibson turns in his 
normally impressive perfor-
mance. As you watch the film 
you are so caught up with his 
character that it is hard to 
remember that you are 
watching a film . Guy Hamilton 
was portrayed with such 
intensity by Gibson that he is 
sure to win many international 
awards for his performance. 
There arc very few actors today 
with the talent and stamina that 
Mel Gibson seems to have. 

The film opens this Friday at 
Mann 's UTe. So everyone go over 
to the Box Office and get Mann 's 
theater passes for the film this 
weekend.

Getting the same old 
'Soft Cell' routine 
The Art of Falling Apart 
Soft CeO 
Sire Records 

By PlARJ( BflJllER 
Soft Cell is a duo that 

specializes in the novelty rock 
format that has become the 
mainstay of lA's KROQ and 
recently San Diego's clone 
station 91X, The band, 
ronslsting of vocalist Marc 
Almond and keyboardist David 
Ball. has been a consistent 
winner on Rick carroll's "Rock 
of the 80s" playlist. lYon Stop 
frotic Cabaret, the band 's 
debut. was a cleverly written 
disc which featured excellent 
singing from Marc Almond, This 
year's edition. The Art of falling 
Apart, falls flat by comparison 
and demonstrates that whatever 
freshness the band may have 
had has now departed. 

Soft Cell offers a number of 
interesting qualities. Marc 
A1mond's vocals are Indeed 
impressive, His style is certainly 
unique. and it fits well with 
Ball's keyboards, which are as 
versatile as any other outfit with 

a synthesizer basis, The problem 
Is the material. The 
arrangements areJust plain dull. 
There Is nothing even close to 
"Say Hello Wave Goodbye" or 
any of the other superb cuts on 
their previous album. 

The worst part of this album, 
however, Is the mini disc which 
accompanies the main record. 
The mini Is an abysmally 

horribl~ prod,uction which 
contains a ten minute ode to a 
spasmodic moron named 
Martin. and a Jimi Hendrix 
melody that would surely make 
the late performer roll over in 
his grave. 

The title track and one or two 
other cuts from The Art of 
falling Apart save this record 
from being a complete 
embarrassment. and no doubt 
KROQ and 91X will play it right 
into the hearts of many modem 
music fans. Let the buyer 
beware. however, because 
boredom is all you will get with 
this album. If you 're in the mood 
for this brand of music and you 
want to listen to Soft Cell. the 
wiser choice in Non Stop frotic 
Cabaret

More than just alot of nudity 
Nudes, a new play by Arthur 

frick. will premier in San Diego 
at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre. The play. which 
involves total nudity. Is based 
on not just what I t is to be nude 
physically In our culture. but 
also what it is to be emotionally. 
spiritually, and even 
intellectually naked in our 
times. 

The playwright. Arthur frick. 
suggests that nudity Is still one 

of the frontiers In our 
civilization: nudity of business. 
of media, of the human soul. and 
of the beauty and vulnerability 
of the pervasive self-conscious 
world we live In. 

frick Is struck by the idea 
that life as we live it together is 
all too intimate. too real and 
human in the way we live it. and 
that our "nudity." In all senses, 
is no embarrassment. no moral 
or egocentric taboo. but rather a

A comedy for 

deep sense of honesty and 
recognition shared in our basic 
love for each other. In fact. since 
there are only two actors in the 
play. a male and female. the 
audience is cast in the script as 
slgniflcant character In the play. 

Nudes has already met with a 
great deal of trepidation and 
curiosity in the acting 
community in San Diego, The 
actors, who are known for their 
expertise in less critical roles 
than being nude on stage, have 
already had to field enormous 
amounts of questions and 
sometimes even wry abuse from 
their collegues. It takes great 
courage to play nude on stage, 
especi ally for professiona I 
actors. whose careers are at 
stake, and especially when one 
could risk being interpreted as 
pornographic or exhibitionistic. 

Director Fred Moramarco 
sums up: " With a brand new 
script. total nudity and a 
controversial subject. the 
challenges for the actors, 
myself. and the audience are 
exceptional." 

Nudes. which stars Don 
McManus and Sandra Zatinsky.

When francois I'fitterrand 
took office promising to 
deregulate france's govern-
ment -controlled electronic 
media, hundreds of illegal -
and often bizarre -_ pirate 
radio stations came out of the 
closet But now, reports PNS 
correspondent Lisa Lian 
Seidenberg from Paris, the 
govemment has legalized only 
a limited number of these 
" radio lib res, " and many 
others are back Under,llfDUnd. 

The airwaves are heating up on 
the notorious Trench radio 

border. Inside operating 
illegally but with broad public 
support, were the hundreds of 
pirate stations, 

Determined not to repeat the 
mistakes of the past, the 
Socialists fired all previous 
network chiefs, But their 
sometime political allies, the 
comm unists, provoked an 
uproar with charges that private 
ownership would lead to 
commercial radio, 

By USA UArI Sf:IDf:"Bf:RG 
racific News Service 

rARIS - The story goes that 
in the old days of French 
"pirate" radio broadcasting -
perhaps a year ago - there was 
a station infamous for its long-
winded but explicit sexual 
discourses, Then one night a 
prostitute propositioned a 
panel of surprised male 
debaters on the air. 
Conversation ceased, to be 
replaced by more erotic sounds, 
Or so the story goes. 

Today, cries of "sabotage" 
and "scandale" still resound on 
the airwaves one year after 
Socialist President francois 
Mitterrand brought about 
promised but limited 
legalization of former 
underground stations here. 

The continuing turmoil 
centers on the allocation of 
frequencies for broadcasting on 
the fM band for private, 
noncommercial use, It's a 
public access scramble similar 
to that launched by the cable TV 
revolution in the United States, 
with one crucial difference: This 
is france, a nation as unfamiliar 
with public access as it is with 

instant colfee, 
Until a year ago, hundreds of 

french radio stations simply 
operated underground. Once 
barely audible, these stations 
moved above ground and 
became more aggressive "radio 
Iibres" in the afterglow of 
Mltterrand 's triumph. Mitter-
rand, long an opponent ofstate-
controlled media. had pledged 
in May 1981 to liberate the 
airwaves from bondage to the 
government. One of his first acts 
was to disconnect direct 
telephone lines between the 
Elysee Palace and the 
broadcasting stations, a link his 
predecessors had found 
indispensable. 

In this heady atmosphere. 
anyone who had ever dreamed 
of owning a radio station could 
have one. All one needed was a 
cheap, low-power transmitter. a 
microphone. some rock 'n' roll 
records and friends who would 
work without pay. "The radio 
libres multipli ed like 
mushrooms after the rain." 
remembers one french 
journalist. 

Sprouting all over the fM 
dial. the new stations had names 
like "Soleii'" (sun). " Riposte " 
(response). " Verte " (green). 
"Carbonne 14" (after the 
radioisotope ). and "Quin-Quin" 
(for Caribbean music). The staffs 
were an assortment of workers. 
North African immigrants. gays, 
recycled 1968 radicals and 

others out'llde the mainstream. 
Mitterrand. after all, had been 

something of a radio pirate 
himself, Three years before his 
election. he had broadcast a 
speech from a pirate 
transmitter. Valery Giscard 
D'Estaing, then president. 
responded with an indictment. 
Charges were later dropped, and 
when the election dust settled, 

it was Mitterrand who had the 
last word. 

The new National Assembly 
elected with him faced the task 
of reorganizing the entire 
broadcasting system. which had 
always been governed by state 
monopoly. Cries for creative 
autonomy had grown over the 

years. but control remained 
with the government. 

In 1972 the unwieldy ORfF 
(french Radio and Television 
Office) was created. placing 
administration and finances 
under the Ministry of 
Informa tion. A public service 
without any public control. the 
ORTf in 1974 became seven 
separate corporations . 

including Radio france and 
three television stations. 
subsidized by taxes. commer-
cials and annual license fees for 
TV sets and radios (eliminated 
in 1977). 

Meanwhile. many "periph-
eral " stations began transmit-
ting from outside the french 

The solution: Starting last 
January, a special commission 
solicited proposals for station 
licenses, In Paris alone. more 
than 300 applicants competed 
for fewer than two dozen 
available spots on the fM dial. 
AM remained state-owned, 

In the past year, competition 
reached dramatic heights, One 
station staff staged a hunger 
strike to protest unfair 
allocations. 

In mid-July, 18 stations 
received licenses They include 
. frequence Presse (for news), 
' frequence Gaie' ( gay 
liberation ), Radio Nora" Uazz\. 
Radio Gilda" (for children), 
Generation 2000" (rock 'n' 

roll ), " frequence Dom-Tom " 
(reggae . and calypso) and a 
station each for the Jewish, 
Muslim and Christian 
communties, 'Cite 96: a left-
leaning station backed by Prime 
Minister Andre Mauroy, also won 
a license. fueling charges of 
favoritism 

for now, this new generation 
of pirates is being left alone, for 
the future - who knows? As the 
saying has it. "The more things 
change. the more they remain 
the same:

T wo "fi rsts" went into the UCSD sports hIstory books last weekend, and the co-At hletes 

of the Week were directly involved in the accomplishment, Last Saturday, Chris 
Li ttlewood, after finishing in the top to in all previous events this season, turned a trick no 
other UCSD skier ha ever matched. The slalom race at Goldmine wa begun by 140 skIers 
from the major Southern California school: 90 of those athlete dIdn 't even finIsh the 
course_ Of the rest, 49 finished behind Littlewood, the first Triton skIer to win such an 
event. Meanwhile, the All-Cal Tournament title in men's tennIS went to UCSD for the first 
time ever. Part of the reason was the play of Dan Beers, who has yet to lose a match in either 
singles or doubles this season, Beers defeated the #5 si ngles competitIOn of RIverside (6-0, 6· 
1 scores), Santa Cruz (7·6,6-4), and Santa Barbara (6·2, 6-1) while also teaming with doubles 
pa rtner Dave Neal to defeat the third seeded teams of the three schools 

The first individual ski victory and the first men's tennis All-Cal title will go into the 
UCSD record books, thanks to co·AOTW winners Beers and Littlewood.

If it were not for a 67-55 

setback to Pomona Pitzer in 
the second game of the season , 
the UCS D women'- basketball 
team would be look ing awful 
pretty for t he upcomi ng NCAA 
playoffs. Even after crushi ng 
Southern Cali forni a College 
77-52 T uesday night in the 
Pavill ion , it seems Pomona, 
not UCSD, will be the final 
Western cl ub chosen for the 
Western Regional, held March 
3-5. T he NCAA elects 32 
Divi, ion III teams around the 
country and places them in 

eight regions. Two Minnesota 
teams and one Texas club 
appear to have a reservat ion 
a lready booked for t h e 
Western Regional (a site ha 
yet to be determi ned), wh ich 
leaves one vaca ncy open . 
Pomona is t h e leadi n g 
candidate beca use it was t he 
nation 's thi rd ra nked club a 
year ago and has played an 
abundance of Division II 
schools this season. T he 
Tritons will probably fini h 
with a better record than t he· 
Sagehens (18·8 to 17-9), bu t t he 
12 poi nt November loss u p in 

Pomona looms large right now 
in the minds of the selection 
committee. 

Even if UCSD IS victorious 
in its remaining three home 
games, the chances are slim. 
Most players are pessimi_ tic, 
and so is Head Coach Judy 
M a l o n e. " [ t h ink the 
probabil ities are not very 
good," Malone aid r ight after 
SCC had disposed of the men's 
team . "Someth ing outrageou 
would have to happen for us to 
make the playoffs," If UCSD 
had been able to defeat Cal 
Bapti t last Friday night. the 

would have had "legitimate 
shot" according to the Triton 
coach. But since \Ictorv was 
not obtained, most o'f the 
team's focus has been placed 
on finishing strong, possibly 
with 18 wins. 

Of their 15 \'ictories thus 
far, perhaps only one looked as 
easy as Tue day's rout. From 
the beginning, the Tritons, 
dres ed in their white home 
uniforms were in command 
offensively and defensively.

UCSD reeled off 18 unan·

The final 10 minutes were for 
the most part "garbage time"

rate. Four Tritons reached 
double figures in the 25-point

points) with Teik Francis. who 

was dominating from the

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writer, 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT, The moment of truth 
has anwed. Tomorow from 2-4 pm the Regi stratIOn Fee 
Committee will discuss and vote on whether or not to grant the 
intercollegiate athletic program the $106,000 they need for 
coaches salaries. Currently, Athletic Director Judy Sweet has 
$38,000 to divide among 22 coaches, so the increase would raise 
the dismal total to a somewhat respectable $144 ,00, or an 
average of $6,500 per coach. ''I'm reasonably optimistic because 
most of the people that I've talked to realize the dilemma we 
face ," said Physical Education Chairperson Howard Hunt. "We 
will be discussing the entire LA. budget as well." On what 
probably will be the most crucial decision affecting 
Intercollegiate Athletics in quite some time, the prognosis looks 
good according to our sources. We urge your support! The 
meeting is open to the public. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. John Robinson . The 
former USC senior vice president in charge of public relations, 
who resigned as Trojan football coach in November with a vow 
to "stay away from the game," has cut s hort hIS departure by 
accepting the head coach ing position with the Los Angeles Rams. 
He reportedly will be paid in excess of one million dollars over a 
three year period. With Robinson at the helm, don't expect the 
Lambs to be quite as timid as they were with Ray Mala issy. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Two clubs that have gone 
relatively unnoticed at UCSD this year have been the men's and 
women 's tennis teams. Both are 4-0 and coming off impre sive 
victories this past weekend. The men, coached by newly hired 
J)on Kramer, creamed UC Riverside, Santa Cruz, and Santa 
Barbara on their way to capturing the AII·Cal Tournament. 
Meanwhile, the women, coached by Liz Dudash, defeated the 
number one ranked team in the nation, Occidental, 7-2. It was 
sweet revenge for UCSD since the same Oxy team beat them for 
the Dvision III nalional title last year. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Once again, the cheapest 
orga nization in baseball prevail s. The Los Angeles Dodgers won 
their arbitration hearing with Pedro Guerrero Tuesday, and 
consequent Iy saved themselves $150,000. Guerrero hit .304 with 
32 homes and 100 RBIs (all team highs), batted clean up. stole 22 
bases in 27 tries, and started all three outfield positions. But 
when he asked for $750,000 per year, the arbitrator apparently 
felt that was too high . $750,000 is an awful lot of money, but not 
by modern baseball standards. 70 players in the big leagues now 
make over $700,000. Are you going to tell us that there are 70 
players better than Pedro Guerrero? At lanta's Bruce Benedict, 
who manager Joe Torre hopes will be the back·upcatcher, makes 
$500,000. Is Guerrero only worth $100,00 more than Benedict?

BIOHAZARDS: «(ront row I to r) Diane O 'Dowd, Sean. Sandy Mann, Debbie 
Andrews, AdelaIde Carpenter. Back row: Betty Alice Ferguson, Bonnie 
Granzow, Leslie Blair. I\art~n Peyerle, Leslie Henderson. 

The Biohazard's name is synonymous with fine intramural teams 
over the years and this women's floor hockey team is no exception. 
This group of mild mannered lab assistants have been playing and 
winning at floor hockey longer than intramural fossil Frank Vernon 
has been playing. Sandy Mann, a recent mother of 6 months, proved 
that motherhood does not preclude having a wicked wrist shot by 
scoring the Biohazards first goal. Debbie Andrews knocked in the 
next goal to give the Biohazards what they thought was a comfortable 
two goal lead. But while the Biohazards were singing the Welcome to 
Miller Time song their opponents, the Bruisers, scored two last 
minute goals fo earn a 2-2 tie . Defensive dynamo Debbie ODowd was 
heard to have remarked after their decisive letdown, "That's the last 
lime. We will tap no keg before it's time."

U CSD rally falls 2 hoops short 

Ron Hicks skies to the hoop, but UCSD lost to outhern Cal 
College to even its record at 11-11.

A furious rally which sa\" 
UCSD come from 15 P010t s 
down with s ix minutes left fell 
two hoops short in a 70-66 loss 
t o Southern Cal College 
Tuesday night in Triton

14 The UCSD Guardian Thursday, February 17, 1983 

Men's hoop falls to sec by four score with 20 seconds left and cut the lead to four. Goodman 
committed a technical by 
fouling an SCC player out of 
bounds, but Roberts mis ed 
the free throw. With 16 
seconds Goodman intention-
ally fouled Hirst who missed 
both free throws (haven't we 
played that song before), and 
the Triton capsule followed. 

Banales had nine and Hicks, 
Maross, McGuire, Nixon , 
Rasmussen, and Flint all 
finished with six. Larry Hirst 
and Roberts had 18 and 16 for 
the victors. 

continued from page 13 
pointer and the game was in 
the refrigerator with the door 
closed. 

Down by 15 with only six 
minutes left. UCSD was also 
down to its last timeout and it 
appeared hopeless. The only 
remaining question was the' 
margin of defeat. Not so fast. 
Mike Maross kept UCSD close 

with some intense play inside 
and Goodman converted inside 
after missing twice but 
out jumping the defense for 
two rebounds. Still down by 
nine with only 1:20 left, 
Brandon Nixon hit a 21-footer 
from the top of the key. Smith 
got half of that back with a free 
throw at 1:12. With one 
minute left, Goodman drove all

the way to score and Block 
used the last timeout with the 
core 70-64. Nixon fouled Rich 

Rogers who missed both free 
throws, but the Tritons 
turned it over . Maross 
intentionally fouled Hirst, 
who doesn't know how to 
shoot free throws. Hirst 
missed both and Maross drove 
the lane at the other end to 

Goodman led UCSD with 16 
points, all of which were 
scored in the second half. 

The Tritons will hit the road 
to take on Cal-Baptist thi s 
Friday before returning to the 
Pavilion for the final two 
games of the year against 
undefeated Westmont and a 
second place (8-2) Pt. Lorna

RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE 

Largest military force since Viet N am 
By WILLIAM BEEMAN 

Pacific News Service 
deployable. Its very ability to 
perform it original mission i 
in question. In the word of 
Brown University analyst 
M.A. Dilorenzo of the Center 
for Foreign Policy Develop-
ment, the RDF today is 
"militarily ineffective, 
physically wa teful and 
diplomatically dangerou ." 

and the massive equipment 
commitment, the RDF has lost 
its specialized character. In 
fact, its troops have been 
trained for conventional 
ground, sea and air warfare in 
exercises in Oman and Egypt 
over the last year, with all of 
the permanent upply lines

According to its commander, 
Lt. Gen. Robert C. Kingston, 
the RDF area of operation will 
extend far beyond the Persian 
Gulf itself to cover 20 
countries throughout South-
west Asia and East Africa. 

With almost no fanfare, the 
largest new U.S. miliary 
command since the Vietnam 
War came into existence Jan. 
1. It is the Rapid Deployment 
Force (RDF), originally 
conceived under the Carter 
admini tration a a small, 
quick expeditionary force for 
control of Middle Ea t oil and 
trade, but ince grown to a 
mas ive , lumbering joint 
command which eventually 
will include up to a half-
million troop . 

" ... the RDF provides incentive 
to utilize military force ... " 

Moreover, the need to 
protect Persian Gulf oil and 
trade has changed dramati-
cally since the RDF was 
conceived. Only 8 percent of 
U.S. imported oil currently 
comes from the Per ian Gulf, 
and Japan now has taken over 
as the principal trader in the 
area, with the European 
NATO countries following 
close behind. Given these 
change, one wonders if the 
$20 billion in start-up costs 
added to the permanent yearly 
maintenance costs for half a 
million personnel, are really 
being committed solely to 
protect U.S. economic 
intere t . 

Over the next five years, two 
Army divi ions, one Marine 
division , five Air Force tactical 
fighter wings and three Navy 
aircraft carriers will be added 
to the present equipment of 
the force. 

Partly because of its 
massive size, the RDF no 
longer i a rapid force, and 
orne military analyst even 

worry that it may no longer be 

I n a recen t report, 
DiLorenzo concluded that 
rather than being a relatively 
benign, stabilizing military 
option, the RDF provides a 
strong incentive to the United 
States to utilize military force 
prematurely and inappro-
pria tely, and to "reconstruct 
the doctrine respon ible for 
the disaster in Vietnam." 

With its immense troop size 

actual battle. Thu ,it appears 
this new force is really 
designed for long-term, high 
intensity conflict. 

The RDF mission -
protecting Western oil and 
trade - may sound reasonable 
to the post-ho tage-crisis 
American public. But on 
inspection, the entire 
operation smacks of overkill. 

It is far more likely that the

The Most Sophisticated Training Ground 
For Nudear Engineering 

Isn't On The Ground. 

It's on a Navy ship. 
The Navy has

more than anyone else 
in America. The Navy

while you're still in school. Qualified 
juniors and seniors earn approximately 
$1,000 per month while they finish school. With a nuclear program like that, you 

know the Navy also offers the most compre-
hensive and sophisticated nuclear training. 

As a nuclear-trained officer, after 4 
years with regular promotions and pay 
increases, you can be earning as much as 
$40,500. That's on top of a full benefits pack-
age that includes medical and dental care, 
and 30 days' vacation earned each year. 

Every officer in the Nuclear Navy 
completes a full year of graduate level 
technical training. Outside the Navy, this 
kind of program would cost you thousands. 
In the Navy, you're paid while you learn. As a nuclear-trained officer, you also 

earn a place among this nation's most 
qualified and respected professionals. So, 

Then, as a nuclear-trained officer, you 
supervise highly trained personnel in the 
operation of the most 
advanced nuclear 
propulsion plants 
ever developed. You 
get a level of technical 
and management 
experience unequalled 
anywhere else.

fear that the last of it s client 
states in the Mideast - Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia and Oman - arc 
increasingly unreliable. 

A settlement of the Afghan 
cri i may require that the 
U.S. military influence in 
Paki tan dimini h. Internal 
political struggles in Saudi 
Arabia may cau e a turn away 
from cooperation with the 
United States. Oman's Sultan 
Qaboos sit· uneasily on his 
throne, and ome Egyptians 
already are anticipating a 
cooling towards the United 
States by the Mubarak regime, 
which has been stung by ils 
lack of direct influence over 
U.S. and Israeli Middle East 
policy. 

Israel itself, specifica ll y 
excluded from the purviews of 
the RDF, ha become virtually 
uncontrollable . There may 
come a day when the United 
States might not be able to 
count on a friendly port 
anywhere in the region. 

Thus, as a hedge against the 
erosion of friendly coopera· 
tion, the RDF will serve as a 
looming pre ence, a reminder 
of U.S. military behind the 
scenes. 

The demon that drives this 
and '0 many other military 
schemes of the current 
administration is the fear of 
the Soviet nion and, in thIS 
ca, e, what the Russians might 
do in the Per ian Gulf if given 
the chance. 

One scenario has them 
rolling down to the Gulf over 
an Iran locked in civil war and 
di array following the death of 
Khomeini. Another ha the 
Red Army seizing effective 
control over Afghanis tan and 
launching a quick strike 
through Baluchi tan to the 
Sea of Oman and the Straits of 
Hormuz. Still a third has them 
arching up to Abu Dhabi from 
the People's Democrati c 
Republic of Yemen through a 
weakened Oman. 

These scenarios assume 
first that the Soviet would 
have some good reason for 
wanting to do all this. Second, 
they a sume that the regional 
states will roll over and play 
dead while the superpowers 
slug it out on their soi l. And 
third, they assume that other 
regional powers, like India and 
Pakistan, would do nothing at 
all. None of these assumptions 
stands up to careful scrutiny. 

The Soviet Union itself does 
not need Persian Gulf oil, and 
it would be politically fooli sh 
to be the cause of the 
disruption of oil to other Asian 
and African nations whom the 
' oviets hope to be friendly . 

Moreover, the regional states 
don't want eitherthe ovietor 
the U.S. military on their soil 
and are likel y to go to great 
lengths to keep them out. This 
raises the specter of the United 
States struggling with the 
very nation s it intends to 
defend for the right to carry 
out that defense. 

The greatest danger in 
having such a useless force lies 
primarily in the urge to use it 
in order to justify it s being 
there. 

However, with the Ameri · 
can economy in disa rra y, the 

n~"t annoying aspect of the
