he UCSD women's soccer team captured 
its third consecutive National Collegiate 

Athletic Association Championship Dec. 2 in 
front of a home crowd at Triton Soccer 
Stadium, knocking off the Lady Buccaneers 
from Christian Brothers University with goals 
from Elizabeth Hughes and Kristen Jones. 

While offense grabbed all the attention, 
this game belonged to the stifling Triton defense that held 
CBU scoreless for the first time this season. 

The Bues entered the game heavily favored, thanks to a 
record-breaking attack that saw them topple the NCAA record for 

goals scored. Division II Player of the Year Missy Gregg led the Bues' 
attack with 73 goals in 22 games, a new NCAA record. Secondary 

offensive options induded Irish National Team member Margaret Saurin, 
who now holds a NCAA record with 29 assists in 22 games, as well as 

22-year-old freshman Anna Hemilund, who is the third-leading scorer for 
the Bues with 16 goals and entered the Final Four with one more goal than

Famous papers are

be housed in Geisel Library's speCIal colledlon sedlon. 

Crick's DNA 
research papers 
will be stored in 
Geisel Library 
By DANIEL WATTS 
Staff Writer 

Copies of the scientific papers 
of DNA molecule co-discoverer 
Francis Crick will be housed in the 
Geisel Library special collection 
section. The move comes as part of 
a deal stipulating that the original 
papers will go to the Wellcome 
Library in London for $2 .5 mil -
lion, the most ever paid to a scien-
tist for his papers. 

The London-based Wellcome 
Trust will contribute half of the 
funds, with the other half coming 
from the United Kingdom's 
Heritage Lottery Fund. 

In 1953, Francis Crick and fel -

low sci entIst James \\'Hson pro-
po ed the double- helic,11 struc tu re 
for DNA and the method by whIch 
DNA replicates. The duo ~\'o n the 
Nobel Prize in phYSIology/m edI-
cine in 1962 "for their discoveries 
concerning the molecul,lr struc-
ture of nucleic acids and its slg l1lf-
icance for information transfer in 
living material. " 

Crick ha been a faculty mem-
ber of the Salk Institute for 
Biological Snldies in La Jolla for 
the past quarter cennlry. 

" UC 0 i delighted to be able 
to work with the Wellcol11e 
Library and the \Vellcome Trust 
on this project," said Lynda 
Claassen , director of the 
Mandeville Special Collections 
Library at UC D . "This is a very 
unusual situation for profe sional 
paper and personal arc hives, 
we're delighted we can be part of 
it."

also allowing students me opporruni -
ty to stay after class and a k professors 
questions wimout me worry of being 
la te for meir next class. 

"\¥hat was not anticipated at me 
time of the [1996] decision ," 
Bernstein said, "was the fact mat me 
campus would, in a few years, face 
unprecedented increases in enroll-
ments that would put a great deal of 
pressure on existing cl assroom and 
scheduli ng capacity. " 

T he 1996 decision to lengmen 
passi ng peri ods removed one 50-
minute scheduling slot on Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays. This latest 
change would effectively restore more 
fl exibil ity for faculty and the 
Registrar's office to schedule classes. 

"To me, I see this solution as me 
most obvious short· term answer," 
sa id David R. Miller, associate vice 
chancellor of Academic Planning & 
Resources. "We've watched me sirua-
tion for two years and have seen it 
become a re;1 problem. Ir comes 
down to [the UC Office of the 
President] aski ng uS to enroll more 
srudents than we can house in our 
faciliti es. " 

\¥hile agreeing that the latest 
change in scheduling logistics will 
alleviate some of me problems created 
by the rising student population, 
Miller said that mis is not the only 
solution to the I<!ng-term problem. 
Construction of new classroom space, 
Miller says, is a goal of campus 
administration. 

As it stands, however, construction 
of a state-funded classroom building 
would not be able to begin until 2008, 
and such a structure would most like-
ly not be occupied until 2010. Miller

The copies to be stored at Geisel

and me brain. 

"I think its wonderful mat me

places for my papers to go." 

Crick's papers probabl y will be 
available for research use by scholars, 
scientists and medical historians wim· 
in two years, according to Claassen. 

"\Vhil e Dr. Crick is alive, only he 
will have access to the papers at 
UCSD," she said. "After Wellcorne 
Library fin ishes organi zing the 
papers, we will organize ours and men 
they will be open for research by any-
one." 

Only qualified researchers who 
furnish a photographic form of identi-
fication and who complete a Reader 
Registration form may usc me special

and are used under library supervi -
sion. 

Almough the papers that are to be

"UCSD will have the only copies

Sociologist finds link between 
stress and heart attacks 

Psychological stress can lead to deadly heart 
attacks, according to a recent study conducted by 
UCSD sociologist David Phillips. 

Phillips and his team used a computer program 
to analyze death certificates of over 200,000 
Chinese·American and Japanese-American subjects, 
as well as 47,000,000 Caucasions all of whom died 
between 1973 and 1998 in the United States. 
Researchers looked for a relationship between the 
deaths of the Chinese-Americans and Japanese-
Americans who died due to heart attacks on the 
fourth day of the month because in those cultures, 
the number four is associated with death, discomfort 
and apprehension. 

The research team found a 13 percent increase 
in ca rdiac deaths occurring on the fourth day of the 
month for the Chinese and Japa(1ese deceased com· 
pared to their white counterparts. 

The team tested nine different controls to take 
into account possible nonpsychological elements 
that could lead to fatal heart attacks. 

The research appears in the December 2001 
issue of the British Medical Journal. UCSD mathe-
matics professor Ian Abramson and UCSD students 
George Liu, Kennon Kwok, Jason Jarvinen and Wei 
Zhan contributed to the project.

Researcher finds new role for 
chemotherapy drugs 

A new role for cancer chemotherapy drugs that 
may limit tumor formation and metastasis by attack· 
ing cell growth was discovered in a study led by 
Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine Jeffery 
Esko of the UCSD School of Medicine. 

Esko's research found that tumor development 
could be inhibite~ in vitro as well as. in lab mice by 
not allOWing the cancer cell to to receive polyamines, 
which are substances essential to the cell's growth. 

DFMO, a commonly used inhibitor drug. was 
used to stop the polyamines from being produced. 

~FMO IS currently being used in clinical trials by indio 
Viduals who are at risk of developing certain types of 
cancers. 

The findings appear in the Dec.18 issue of 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sdences. 
Scientists from Lund University in Sweden can-
tnbuted to the research, along with Mark Fuster of 
the UCSD department of medicine and Jillian Brown 
of the UCSD department of cellular and molecular 
medicine. 

Grants from the International Union Against 
Cancer, Swedish Cancer Fund, the Tobacco·Related 
Disease Program at the University of Califomia and 
the National Institutes of Health provided funding for 
the research.

Lawmakers must support and 
protect gay adoption rights 

By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Raising children is a complicated and 
esoteric process that challenges every parent 
wh o undertakes it. A huge industry is based 
on telling people how to parent: From Dr. 
Spock to the "Baby Whispcrer," plenty of 
people think they know how to raise healthy 
babi es into healthy adults better than you do 
- and every one of them has different 
tricks, tips and techniques. 

But ulere are common threads. Loving 
parents are clearly important in helping 
children to grow, and children must have a 
sen e of security; continuity and stability afe 

often named as conditions conducive to pro-
ductive parenting. 

These elements can be and are present in 
many di fferent kinds of families, such as sin-
gle-parem households, blended families and 
children who live with grandparents or 
other extended family members. And yes, 
children can grow and learn with same-sex 
parents, and these families should be pro-
tected and encouraged. 

The issue of gay parenting is one that has 
been perplexing the nation for decades. 
Some states, such as California, have no spe-
cific provisions to allow, for example, a les-

Fostering a childless faction of Ir{)n 
society helps to preserve culture ~ 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Senior S"taff Writer 

r should write a disclaimer before I start 
this article: As a lesbian who plans on 
adopting or being a co-biological mother 
of chi ldren in the future, it's not exactly 
fair for me to write a con on gay adoption. 
My views and argumentative style will be 
skewed and inefficient in the eyes of the 
homophobic constituency that I am sup-
posed to represen t. 

Oddly enough, it's logical that I'm writ-
ing this article. It's easy for a homophobic 
person to write an article against gay adop-
tion. However, gays and straights alike 

" I ... ••• .. • t .. ... 

have heard the arguments that homopho. 
bie people would use. Accordingly, it's 
refreshing and more interesting that r, as a 
lesbian, argue against gay adoption. 

However, I'm arguing against gay 
rights for a different reason than most 
would assume: because I believe that in 
order to preserve its culture, America 
needs a childless adult population. 

This deliberation over gay adoption 
was prompted by a November 2001 court 
ruling in San Diego that made 10,000 to 
15,000 adoptions by California same-sex 
partnerships legall y invalid. The ruling

bian to adopt the biological child of her 
parmer. However, many couples achieved 
the goal of creating a more unified family 
by using "second-parent" adoptions. 

In this procedure, the biological parent 
allows someone to whom they are not mar-
ried to adopt his or her child while retain-
ing his or her own parental rights. Adoption 
law generally requires the biological parent 
to relinquish parental 

Their fear is driven by the protestations 
of a very vocal minority that believes chil-
dren raised by homosexuals will be some-
how damaged by having two parents of the 
same sex. Indeed, according to California 
Sen. William Knight, sponsor of 2000's 
Proposition 22, which banned gay marriage 
in California, "Two people of the same sex 
are not a family. They're not normal." 

Both of these statements are ridiculous. 
A family is not defined by the genders or 
sexual preferences of its members, but by 
the love and care that binds them. And to 
say that gay couples are not "normal" 
implies that there is some state that is. 
However, families and people come in all 

rights, but the "second-
parent" adoptions had 
been informally recog-
nized because they repre-
sented the wish of the 
parent, which was valued 
higher than rigid adher-
ence to the letter of the 
law. 

Gay rights 
organizations 
estimate that 

between 10,000 and 
20,000 gay couples 

in California have 

shapes, sizes and configu-
rations. Indeed , what 
Knight probably consid-
ers to be normal - one 
man, one woman and 2.5 
children - is on the 
wane. 

California is taking 
steps to recognize the 
legitimacy of gay families. 
September's domestic 
partners bill, which went 
into effect Jan. I, allows 
same-sex couples to regis-
ter with the state as 
domestic partners, and 
are then eligible for many 
of the benefits afforded to 
marri ed couples. Included 

This procedure, how-
ever, was challenged and 
subsequently struck down 
in the 4th District COUrt 
of Appeal right here in 
San Diego. Judges ruled 
that these adoptions were 
based on an overly liberal 
interpretation of the law. 

used the "second-
parent" adoption 

procedure, and 
thousands more live 
in unofficial families 

with children. 
A panic ensued among 

gay parents because of wording in the rul-
ing that suggested the adoptions that had 
already been performed were illegal and 
invalid. 

Although this language was later 
removed from the ruling, leaving existing 
"second-parent" adoptions intact but future 
ones prohibited, the incident brings to light 
the tenuous state of gay families. 

Unfortunately, legislators are often hesi-
tam to make official what is not only com-
mon (gay rights organizations estimate that 
between 10,000 and 20,000 gay couples in 
California have used the "second-parent" 
adoption procedure, and thousands more 
live in unofficial families with children), but 
also as legitimate and beneficial to children 
as any heterosexual parenting could be. 

among these benefits is 
access to stepparent adoption, which has 
long been a way for non biologica l parents 
to become legally recognized . 

There are, however, shortcomings to 
this plan. Because the adoption is contin-
gent upon the couple being registered as 
domestic partners, its legality may not be 
recognized in other states. This would leave 
families moving away from California vul-
nerable. Also, gay activists have expressed 
concern that the plan does not provide for 
instances in which the biological parent dies 
or the relationship ends. 

It is important that legislators make the 
issue of gay adoptions a priori ty. In 
California, input from couples and children

came from a case in which a lesbian sued to 
block her former partner from "second-
parent adoption" of the partner's co-bio-
logical child. (In this context, "co-biologi-
cal" describe.s a same-sex parent who is not 
involved in the actual production of a 
child.) The majority ruling moved to make 
the concept of second-parent adoption 
illegal, negating at least half, if not all, of 

tion of the adult population that is child-
less lies in the prevention of sponsoring a 
too-bland atmosphere of American materi-
alist culture. 

The prime motivating factor for much 
of American popular culture is money. The 
LGBT population, often synonymous with 
the adult childless population, shares that 
factor but lacks the basic rights of many 
other Americans . 

A constant dialogue ,between the sup-
porters and opposition of societal norms 
has created the success that is the United 
States. If the LGBT populati on stays rela-
tively childless on the whole, it will con-
stantly oppose societal norms. Gays will do 

same-sex couple adop-
tions in California. 
However, State 
Assembly Bill 25, which 
took effect on Jan. I , 
largely invalidates the 
ruling. 

Consequently, the 
issue of gay adoption has 
come to the forefront of 
San Diego and 
California affai~s and 
merits deliberation. 

People are generally 
less worried about finan-
cial stability before they 
have or adopt children. 
During the childless

people are more likely to

this for years to come 
because of the discrimir.a -

within society. 

Though the United 
States' strength lies in its 
differences, the melting 
pot has been made bland 
by the feti sh for mass 
materialism that even nor-
mally countercultural gay 
men have begun to emu-
late. 

Don 't get me wrong -
gay culture has its own 
struggles with creativity. 
Anyone walking in 
Hillcrest will notice that a 
majority of the males there 
are dressed suspi ciously 

of society and the world 
similarly, and all have th e

worn across the chest that often accentu-
ates the bulging pecs achieved after years 
of staring in the mirror, weight lifting in 
the 24-hour gym and being attracted to 
themselves. 

There is no doubt that there is discrim-
ination within the lesbian-gay-bisexual-
transgender community itself. However, 
those who are harshly discriminated 
against and have their basic rights demed 
on a daily basis are often the last to pass 
judgment on others. Change does not scare 
gays because many of them have been 
changing to live "normal" or decent lives 
by mainstrea TTl ~ociety 's standards. 

Notwithstanding, gay men and lesbians 
encounter daily homophobia and will con-
tinue to fight the societal norm, whatever 
it may be, because to them it represents 
homophobia and discrimination. Only 
when gays are accepted will they stop 
fighting the culture that the masses foll ow.

I love Hillcrest, and it was 
n o t so obvious to me at first 
why I loved it. First, there are 
no children, which normally 
ca use people to become con-
serva ti ve . Children, cute as 
they are, are d angerous to cul-
ture. 

This scenario is created by 
what UCSD 's Bixi B. Craig, 
publisher of San Diego' les-
bian magazine, "The

Western family structure, 
which is a committed couple 
with one or more 

homogeneous environments 
in which adolescents must 
grow up. 

It is

Craig describes 
this situation as 
"being kept in an 
airtight box for 
decades."

time , I am not 
one to argue 
against the 
"Western" style 
of raising chil-
dren, because I 
am a product of

My parents did not buy 

into the urban sprawl and 
conservatism in which many 
parents find themselves. My 
biological parents were fairly 
androgynous and did not 
enforce rigorous gender roles 
on my brother and me. Thus, 
we were more easi ly able to 
find our own niche in the 
world a t a relatively young age 
instead of subscribing to mass 
materialistic culture to hide 
our inner confusion. 

However, the si tuation I 
grew up in was an aberration 
from the norm, from what I 
have been able to conclude. 

It is necessary to maintain 
a segment of the adult popula-
tion that is childless for the 
preservation of c reative 
American culture, and to con-
tinue the opposing dialogues 
within society that cause this 
culture.

Legislation: 
California lawmakers must work 
to protect gay adoption rights 
Continued from page 5 
must be taken into account and the kinks 
should be worked out of the adoption process i 
to provide maximum protection and stability 
for families. 

All this work in our state will come to full 
fruition only when adoptions by gay couples are 
recognized throughout the country. Then we 
can truly say we live in a country that values the 
family and encourages healthy environments 
for chi ldren. 

Gay parenting and gay adoption should be 
encouraged. After all, gays become parents by 
choice (tell me about two gay men having an 
"accident" and I'll hand you the rights for the 
'lV movie). And to want to raise and nurture a 
child, informed of the responsibilities and chal-
lenges that face all parents, is a noble and 
much-needed desire.

Critne statistics 
released for 2000 
Report shows an overall increase in 
violent crimes and vandalism 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Editorial Assistant 

Occurrences of violent crime, 
vandalism and vehicle hit-and-
runs are rising at UCSD, accord-
ing to the recent annual report of 
crime statistics compiled by UC 
Police. The compiled statistics 
reflect crime at UCSD for the 
year 2000, which saw five cases of 
aggravated assault and one case of 
rape. These six violent crimes rep-
resented an increase from zero in 
1999. 

Statistics also showed an 
increase in van-

Craig Shigyo, a Warren senior. "I 
didn't really know what was going 
on. It was just annoying." 

Other significant increases in 
crime include a 31 percent increase 
in vehicle hit-and-runs and a 4 per-
cent increase in public drunken-
ness. 

T here was a J 4 percent 
decrease in total property crime, 
including a 60 percent drop in 
bicycle theft . Bicycle thefts 
dropped from 139 cases in 1999 to 
a 55 in the year 2000. 

Similar trends in crime could 
be seen a t the

pus, increasing

D espite the slight increase in 

violent crimes at UCSD, students 
tend to feel secure.

The Crime Prevention Unit, 
Community Service Officers and

Compromise moves student 
visa legislation to the Hill 
Bill would allow for closer scrutiny of foreign students 

PHILADELPHIA - After 
nearly three months of debate over 
immigration policies, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee has intro-
duced a compromise piece of legis-
lation for the issuing of student 
visas. 

If passed, the bill will place new 
restri ctions on the issuance of 
some student visas and require 
colleges and federal officials to 
more closely track the movements 
of foreign students in the United 
States. 

College lobbyists have met this 
bill with praise because it offers 
more flexibility for student visas 
that was not included in other sen-
ate proposals. 

"The bill is a good solution to 
closing some loopholes that existed 
in immigration policies," said Paul 
Hassen, a spokesman for the 
American Council on Education. 
"The measures are reasonable in 
attempting to create an efficient 
and effective way of monitoring 
foreign students coming to the 
United States." 

Since Sept. 11, there has been 
imense public concern about loop-
holes in the immigration system, 
namely because at least one of the 
19 hijackers entered the United 
States on a studem visa and never 
showed up for classes. 

The visa legislation would gen-
erally prohibit the federal govern-
mem from issuing student visas to 
people from coun tries that the 
State Department considers to be 
sponsors of terrorism. These coun-
tries include Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan and 
Syria. 

Unlike previous proposals, 
however, the bill will allow for 
individual applicants to be exempt-

ed from these restrictions if they 
are determined to pose no safety or 
secu rity threat to the United 
States. 

"\Vhat we're doing is fine- tun-
ing a system where the roles are 
clearly defined and the communi-
cation between the colleges, uni-
versities, the State Department and 
the [Immigration and 
Naturalization Services] is 
enhanced and improved," Hassen 
said. 

Moreover, the proposed legisla-
tion will require colleges and feder-
al officials to track the activities of 
foreign students in the United 
States. Colleges would have to 
report more information about for-
eign students to the immigration 
service, including the sUldents' date 
of entry, date of enrollment and 
field of study. 

According to Joyce Randolph, 
the execu ti ve di rector of the 
University of Pennsylvania'S Office 
of International Programs, Penn 
will have few difficulties in uphold-
ing the requirements of the propos-
al. 

"Should this bill pass, I think 
that the provisions are things that 
the university will have no problem 
complying with," Randolph said. 

In spite of past concerns over 
whether the, legislation would be 
unfair to students a pplying for 
visas, Randolph said that she was 
relieved and felt that this proposal 
was balanced. 

"Our office understands the 
concerns of the government, and 
we are aJso concerned about the 
rights of individuals," Randolph 
said. "These provisions struck a 
compromise position." 

Yct other membcrs of the Penn 
community are wary to accept cer-

tain measures of this bill, namely 
the provision that prohibits the 
immigration of students from ter-
rorist-affiliated countries. 

"The restrictions on student 
visas from countries considered to 
be 'sponsors of terrorism' is by far 
the most disturbing feature of this 
bill, but it seems that here ... the 
administration has decided to 
respond constructively to its crit-
ics," political science professor 
Rogers Smith said. "It has aban-
doned provisions for a total ban 
and instead permits con iderations 
of individual exceptions." 

In the 1999-2 000 academic year, 
a total of3,370 students from coun-
tries deemed to be terrorism spon-
sors attended Anlerican colleges, 
according to the Institute of 
International Education. 

Randolph added that there are 
"very few" students mending Penn 
from these places. 

Political science professor Avery 
Goldstein was cau tious to note the 
potential for more countries to be 
added to this list. 

"This bill sets up a system that 
means that the State Department 
designates countries as sponsors of 
terrorism," Goldstein said. "There 
is a possibility for other countries 
who send large numbers of stu-
dents to the United States to be put 
on these lists." 

Smith added that the bill, in 
general, is much more reasonable 
than previous proposals. 

"The provisions for monitoring 
in various ways can of course be 
abused, but they're not on rheir 
face inappropria te," he said. "On 
the whole, the bill strikes me as a 
defensible compromise."

Wife admits to killing husband 
Medical school administrator stabbed to death by wife 

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa - The 
wife of a slain University of Iowa 
medical school administrator 
admitted to stabbing her husband, 
but said she didn't mean to kill him, 
according to court records released 
Dec. 13. 

Hanging her head io silence, 
Phyllis Nelson appeared in Linn 
County District Court on a first-
degree murder charge for the death 
of Richard Nelson . District · 
Associate Judge Michael 
Newmeister set her bond at 
$250,000. 

Richard Nelson, the executive 
dean of the UI College of 
Medicine, died on the morning of 
Dec. 12 at St. Luke's Hospital in 
Cedar Rapids four hours after 
being stabbed once with a black-
handled knife. 

The couple was not living 
together at the time of the homi-
cide, and police found divorce 
papers in Phyllis Nelson's Iowa 
City home. Richard Nelson leased 
the Cedar Rapids a partmen t where 
he was found dead, and Phyllis 
stayed at 10\0 Highwood St., 
court records said . The couple was . 
alone in the apartment when 
police arrived, according to the 
records. 

Court records and interviews 
paint Phyllis Nelson as an involved 
member of the community - a 
substitute music teacher, a soprano 
in the church choir and a member 
of a dome tic violence intervention 
group. 

The divorce papers, found in a 
manila envelope, were among six 
items Cedar Rapids police obtained 
during 7. search of the Iowa City 
residence. Other items taken from 
the house include a single piece of 
paper with her husband's Cedar 

Rapids address and a letter 
addressed "Dearest Phyllis." 

The substitute music teacher is 
charged with first-degree murder 
instead of a lesser charge because 
she allegedly drove fro'" Iowa Ci ty 
to her husband's Cedar Rapids 
apartment with the knife, police 
said. Authorities contend that 
action implies premeditation. 

"We believe that possibly the 
suspect may have brought the knife 
to the scene with her, and there 
may be more knives of this descrip-
tion at the [Iowa City] residence of 
the suspect and victim," Cedar 
Rapids police Officer James Kelly 
said in court records. No knife sim-
ilar to the one used on Richard 
Nelson was found in his apartment, 
he added . 

Phyllis Nelson clutched a wrin-
kJed tissue to her chest at her initial 
court appearance Thursday. Family 
members sniffed back tears and 
embraced each other and later 
walked from the court room arrn-
in-arm. 

Phyllis Nelson began substitute 
teaching at local elementary 
schools in 1991. 

"She had a good record as a sub-
stitute teacher within the district," 
said Ann Feldmann, the director of 
human resources for the Iowa City 
School District: "\Vhen we asked 
her to come, she came. We had no 
complaints." 

Zion Lutheran Church choir 
director R.O. Moninger said 
Phyllis Nelson joined the choir as a 
sopra no in the 1980 . 

"Phyllis was a faithful, support-
ive and dedicated member or our 
choir," Moninger said. "I have 
appreciated her involvement." 

In October, Phyllis was elected 
to the Domestic Violence 

Intervention Program, Inc. for a 
three-year term. Members "serve 
as volunteers to uphold the agency's 
mission" to end domestic violence 
"through suppOrt, advocacy, shelter 
and education," according to a 
press release fwm the group. The 
group said it had no knowledge of 
the homicide. 

Family members had a brief 
conversation with her attorney, 
David Brown, and later visited her 
in the Linn County Correctional 
Center. 

Iowa City attorney Brown 
would not confirm whether he 
served as Phyllis' divorce attorney 
or comment on how the family is 
doing. Representatives for the fam-
ily told the Daily Iowan they.are sti ll 
grieving and ,viII release a formal 
statemen t Friday. 

Phyllis' preliminary hearing is 
set for Dec. 21 in Linn County 
District Court. 

Richard, 54, of Bloomington, 
Ill., took a job in the UI pediatrics 
departrn"ent in 1987 and quickly 
advanced, becoming the director of 
the Child Health Specialty Clinics 
program at UI Hospitals and 
Clinics. He was assistant executive 
dean for six years before becoming 
executive dean in 2000. 

As one of the ill's highest paid 
employees, making $277,000 a 
year, Richard gained a national rep-
utation for his work with disabled 
children. 

He was an active membec of rhe 
Zion Lutheran Church and helped 
develop the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church of America's social state-
ment on abortion. The Nelsons 
have two adult daughters, Emily 
and Elyse.

Flood wreaks havoc at 
Ti02a Hall 

Muir students exrterience the effects of a 
faulty drainpipe 

1 11 01 After days of pounding. rain 
• • from last week's winter 

storms, UCSD is finally dry, with the 
exception of Tioga Hall. 

A small flood occurred Jan. 11, 2001 on 
the growld floor of John Muir College's 
Tioga Hall . Water quickly spread through-
out the south side of the building in the 
early hours of the morning, prompting 17 
residents to seek higher ground. 

Susan Rindlaub, a Muir freshman, 
awoke just after 8 a.m. to find an inch-and-
a-half of water on the floor of her room. 

"I jumped out of bed in my socks and 
[the water) splashed up all around me," 
Rindlaub said. "My stuff was floati ng in my 
room." 

T he source of the water was a leaky 
drainpipe that was supposed to divert rain 
from the roof of the II-story residence hall 
to the ground floor. However, a cap that 
was supposed to have sealed the pipe came 
100 e, causing gallons of rai nwater to pour 
into the common room between two 
adjoining sui tes.

A.S. Council to fund 
Anti-Zionism We~k 

ControverSial event raises questions 
about money 

1 25 0 1 Amid objections from the • '. ' Union of Jewish Students, 
the A.S. Council is funding the Muslim 
Student Association's Anti-Zionism 
Week, to be held Jan. 29 to Feb. 2, 200 I. 

At last week's A.S. Council meeting, 
Vice President Finance Matt Powell sug-
gested funding the event from a fund cre-
ated in 1994 speci fically for controversial 
issues. 

The council voted against Powell 's 
motion, and instead decided to fund the 
event through the Student O rganizations 
Unal located fund , the fund through which

most student organizations receive money. 
Jonathan Roner, a recent UCSD gradu-

ate, said he feels that many council mem-
bers do not see how offensive the term 
"Anti-Zionism Week" is toJewish students. 

"Certainly they made the claim that 
they're required by law to fund things in a 
content-independent manner," he said. 
"But it's hard for me to imagine that if 
someone had proposed an anti-Asian 
week that they would have gonen fund-
ing. It's my feeling that they don't under-
stand that, to us, Anti-Zionism week is 
equal to Anti-Semitism week." 

Muslema Purmul , treasurer of the 
MSA, agreed with the council vote. 

Purmul said she feels that Anti-Zionism 
Week is being misunderstood by many. 

"I think that the reaction that has been 
voiced is too harsh considering what Anti-
Zionism Week i all about," she said. "I 
feel we're being judged before we've had a 
chance to say anything.'"

2:04.41. 

On day two, Wata nabe came back to

record. 

Day three belonged to Lopez, as she

Despite receiving the highest voter

Referendum failed to pass by ove r 750 
votes, thereby eliminating the pos ibility 
of an annual student fee increase of about

the fee increase and that 3,492 voted 
against it. 

Of t~e school's 18,600 students, 6, 231

rates of minority ad mi ss ions to the 
University of California, the UC Board of 
Regents unanimously voted to rescind 
SP-l and SP-2, the policies that banned 
race-based admission and hiring in the 
university. 

The reso lution , named RE-2 8, 
rescinds policies that critics say discourage 
minoriti es from applying to schools in the 
UC system. 

Regent Judith Hopkinson, the resolu-
tion 's autllOr, stated that it will not resemble

The high price of 
higher learning 
u.s. editions of textbooks costlier 
than international counterparts 
By LOGAN GOH 
Contributing Writer 

Every year, scads of our valu-
able beer-drinking money is wast-
ed on such trivial things as tuition 
fees and textbooks. The various 
ways of acquiring financial aid are 
well-documented, but nobody 
seems to be giving out pamphlets 
on getting cheaper texlbooks for 
students. 

T his is quite a pity, considering 
it is possible to get, say, 
"Fundamentals of Physics" by 
Halliday and Resnick ($120 at the 
UCSD Bookstore) for $25, or 
"Calculus Early Transcendentals" 
Stewart ($100 at the UCSD 
Bookstore) for $24. These books 
are brand new, and in most cases 
indistinguishable from the ones 
sold in the bookstores you may be 
familiar with. At most, they might 
have the words "International 
Edition" printed somewhere on 
them. 

The international edition of a 
textbook is printed by the same 
publisher as the domestic edition, 
and as the name implies, is sold 
for profit in other countries. 
However, they can be up to five 
times cheaper than the domestic 
version. 

time costs of typesetting and such. 
The price goes down if large 
quantities are printed and the 
price goes up if there are many 
color pages. Surprisingly, there is 
no appreciable change to the cost 
between printing hardba ck and 
paperback. 

So why is the international edi-
tion so much cheaper than the 
domestic edition? Unfortunately, 
there does not appear to be any 
conclusive explanation. 

None of the publishers that 
were contacted were interested in 
explaining their pricing decisions 
or revealing their profit margins. 
The foreign bookstores that were 
interviewed provided some rather 
surprising answers - according to 
one shopkeeper, international edi-
tions are cheaper because they are 
printed locally. However, most 
international-edition textbooks 
have the words WPrinted in the 
USA" on the information page. 

Another answer received was 
that textbooks were cheaper 
because they were bought in bulk 
- something that is done by 
bookstores in the United States as 
well as abroad. Some even claimed 
that the international editions 
were cheaper because they were 

printed on thinner 
Before explor-

ing the reasons 
for this price dis-
crepancy, some 
detail regarding 
the costs of pub-
lishing a textbook 
may be helpful. 

According to 
publishers, the 
world of textbook 
publishi ng is a 
cutthroat busi-
ness with very lit-
tle profit. Only a 
small number of 
copies are print-
ed, the warehous-

.A,ccording to one 
shopkeeper, inter-
national editions 

are cheaper 
because they are 

printed locally. 
However, most 

international edi-
tion textbooks 

have the words 
"Printed in the 

USA" on the 
information page. 

paper, but this does· 
not hold with 
observation 
international edi -
tions are over-
whelmingly indis-
tinguishable from 
domestic editions . 
Also, the material 
COSt of printing a 
textbook is onI y a 
trivial fraction of 
the total cost 
involved. 

It's not due to 
the differences in 
currency, as the 

ing costs are massive and new edi-
tions of books come out frequent-
ly, making the previous edition 
nearly impossible to sell . 
Furthermore, textbooks now usu-
ally come in color with elaborate 

diag~ams, and therefore are much 
more difficult to write and typeset 
than your average fiction best-
seller. 

According to the NACS 
College Store Industry Financial 
Report 200 I , for each dollar spent 
on a textbook, 75.4 cents go to the 
publishers, almost all of which 
goes toward the above-mentioned 
expenses, leaving only 7 cents as 
profit. 

Most of these costs are one-time 
costs: paying the writers, editors 
and contributors their advances; 
creating the design of the textbook; 
and setting up the presses to print 
it. After all , once the textbook is 
written, it's written. Also, new revi-
sions, while representing a signifi-
cant amount of work in their own 
ri ght, rarely require as much effort 
as the first edition. 

Ongoing costs to the publisher 
include the cost of shipping, 
which, according to the report, is 
1.4 percent of the price, and the 
cost of paper and the actual print-
ing the book. According to the 
report, the printing COSt takes up 
31 percent of the retail price, but 
this no doubt includes the one-

textbooks are being 
sold at a fraction of the equivalent 
value of U .S. dollars, and any ben-
efit of currency differences to 
operations is unlikely to affect the 
price by such significant amounts. 

Additionally, some analysis 
suggests that the cost of selling 
these textbooks overseas would 
probably be higher than selling 
them locally. After all, the books 
have to be shipped over longer 
distances, and foreign chains of 
distribution have to be estab-
lished. 

Whatever the reason, it's not 
charity on the part of the publish-
ing houses. International editions 
are sold for profit in commercial 
bookstores worldwide. Prices may 
vary widely from country to coun-
try based on the vagaries of cur-
rencyand demand, but all are sub-
stantially lower than domestic 
prices. Even developed countries 
like the UK and Australia enjoy 
the benefits of the international 
edition. 

For students feeling the pinch 
at the bookstore checkout this 
quarter, the lure of cheap interna-
tional textbooks may be appeal-
ing, but the publishers apparently 
took this into account: It's illegal 
to import or sell international edi-
tions in the United States. 

The onIy recommendation may 
be to cut back on the beer budget 
and reserve more cash for books.

tie the game, the overtime period 
was all UeSD, with McGann 
accounting for five of the Tritons' 13 
points in the extra period to ensure 
the victory. Freshman Margaret 
Johnson and senior Danyiel 
Wort/taIn both posted double-dou-
bles and were instrumental in help-
ing the Tritons out-rebound SFSU 
48-34. 

The next weekend, UCSD took 
on Cal State Bakersfield and ended 
up playing its second consecutive 
overtime game, unfortunately com-
ing up on the short end of a 96-95

Continued from page 20 

In the second round, UCSD 
squared off against UC Santa Cruz 
and beat its host 76-54. This time it 
was sophomore Ryan Swed who 
carried the Tritons, posting 18 
points and nine rebounds in the vic-
tol)'. 

The following weekend, UCSD 
faced Sonoma State University in 
its league opener and fell to the 
Cossacks 65-74. UCSD shot only 
37.1 percent from the field and was 
out-rebounded 43-27 by the much 
larger Cossack team. Sophomore 
Ryan Rikansrud came off the bench 
to lead the Tritons with 19 points, 
while Christensen, Woods and 
fresh man Hassan Bassiri all 
reached double fil,'l.lres. 

The next day, UCSD hosted San 
Francisco State and by halftime had 
a 30-26 adVlln tage over the Gators. 
Yet SFSU shot 52 percent in the sec-
ond hal f en route to a 71-62 victol)' 
over the Tritons. Woods led ueSD 
with 15 points, while Bassiri added 
10 points off the bench. 

On Dec. 14 the Tritons battled 
Cal State Bakersfield and struggled 
against the Roadrunners, falli ng 
behind by 16 points at halftime and 
eventually losi ng 62 -85. 
Christensen and freshman Jordan 
Watkins were the only UCSD 
players to score in double figures, 
while the Roadrunners had five 
players reach double digits. • 

A day later, the Tritons took on 
Cal State Stanislaus and earned 
their first league victol)' against the 
Warriors 71-57. Christensen again 
led the Tritons with 21 points on 
eight-of- I 2 shooting, and Watkins 
finished the game with 14 points 
and 10 rebounds to notch his first 
collegiate double-double. 

On Dec. 28, the Tritons trav-
eled to Alaska for the first time in 
school history to play two games 
against the University of A1aska-
Fa.irbanks. The first game marked 
the return of sophomore guard 
Cameron Jackson to the starting 
lineup, but his 10 points weren't 
enough because UCSD fell to the 
Nanooks 50-67. It was the first 
win for UAF. which had previous-
ly lost its first eight games of the 
season . 

The second game was much 
closer, but had the same result 
when the Tritons again lost to the 
Nanooks 74-76. Ryan Swed led 
UCSD with 17 points, however 
UAF received 41 points from its 
bench to overcome the Tritons. 

So far, January hasn't proven to 
be a kind month for the Tritons -
they hi t the road and dropped a 50-
77 decision Friday night against 
Cal State Los Angeles, then were 
handed their fourth loss in a row by 
Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Saturday 81-87. 

The Tritons wiII try to end their 
10 ing streak Jan. II , when they 
host Cal Poly Pomona at RIMAC 
Arena . 

score. In overtime Roadrunner 
Heather Garay, who torched the 
Tritons all night, scored eight of the 
Roadrunners' 12 overtime points to 
lead Bakersfield past the Tritons. 
Sargent again led UeSD, scoring 22 
points and hitting six of seven from 
beyond the three point arc. 

The next day, the Tritons quickly 
rebounded from the heart-breaking 
loss with a 65-58 victol)' over Cal 
State Stanislaus. The Triton defense 
kept them in the game, since they 
held the Warriors to a paltry 27 per-
cent from the field. Offensively, 
Ginn posted a career-high 20 points, 
and McGann and Sargent scored 15 
and 10 points, respectively. 

After their victol)' over 
Stanislaus, the Tritons enjoyed a 
two-week break as they prepared to 
host the 22nd annual UCSD 
Doubletree Invitational Women's 
Basketball Tournament Dec. 28 
through Dec. 29. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

The Tritons first took on Point 
Lorna and readily dispatched the 
Crusaders 60-52. Ginn again led the 
Tritons with 15 points, and Bromley 
added 12 for a Triton offense that 
shot 36.7 percent from the field. 
Fok, in her first game back from 
injury, added seven points in 16 min-
utes of play, 

The next day, the Tritons found a 
tougher opponent in the nationally 
ranked Central Washington and 
were forced to play their third over-
time contest before finally prevailing 
67-61. Ginn had another career-high 
night for the Tritons, scoring 27 
points and pulling down 11 
rebounds. She was later named MVP 
of the tournament, while Wortham 
received All-Tournament honors. 

"We never give up," said Malone 
of her yOl.!ng Tritons. "They work 
really, really hard and just never give 
up." 

After the tournament, UCSD 

battled Montana State-Billings, 
which was also undefeated in the 
Doubletree Invitational. The 
YeUowjackets proved to be the better 
ream, dispatching the Tritons 67-57 
and ending their three-game win-
ning streak. The Tritons hurt them-
selves with 23 rurnovers and shot 
only 25.9 percent from the floor. 

Friday night, Cal State Los 
Angeles handed the Tritons their 
third league loss 68-55. The young 
Tritons continued their shooting 
woes, ending the night with a 28.8 
shooting percentage. Sargent, who 
contributed I I points off the bench, 
and Johnson, who finished with 10 
points, were the only players to fin-
ish in double figures for the strug-
gling Triton offense. 

"We beat Cal State Los Angeles 
twice last year," Malone said. "So 
there's a revenge factor for them this 
year." 

The next night saw Cal State 

SPORTS 15 

Dominguez Hills increase UCSD's 
losing so-eak to four games, beating 
the Tritons 56-46. Poor shooting 
again plagued UCSD, which scored 
only 15 points in the first half to the 
Toros' 32. Ginn was the only Triton 
to reach double digits in scoring, 
ending the game ,vith 14 points. 

According to Malone, the young 
Tritons are still eying to adjust to 
playing with each other. 

"We still have a lot of things to 
learn," she said. "Our defense isn't 
what it should be, and offensive 
teams are a little quicker than we are. 
Some of our young players just don 't 
know how to adjust. Experience is a 
big factor in college basketbalL" 

Despite the recent losing so-eak. 
Malone is upbeat about the team's 
prospects. 

"They are real hard workers and 
competitive," Malone said. "Those 
are all the ingredients that will make 
a good team in the future."

sive machine. And he knew exactly 
wha t to do: move senior Jessica 
Cordova frolll her usual midfield 
stopper role into the defense to 
mark the high-scoring Gregg. 

Cordova responded to the chal-
lenge, playing her best game of the 
postseason and limiting Gregg to 
only two weak attempts on goal. 

It was not just Cordova who was 
at the root of the amazing defensive 
performance; outside backs Molly 
Carlson and Christine Wensel 
played outstanding games of their 
own by neutralizing the speed of the 
Bucs, while Julia Cuder held the 
back line at sweeper. 

The defense did not play well the 
whole game, however, coming out 
flat against an energized Bues squad 
that roared out of the gates \vith 
seven shots in the first 15 minutes. 

The furious charge culminated in 
CBU's best opportunity1Jf the game 
when a close-range shot from Saurin 
hit the left post before falling hann-
lessly to a Triton defender. 

"In every game you need a bit of 
luck, and that came when the ball 
hit the crossbar," McManus said of 
Saurin's shot. 

The close call seemed to wake 
up the Tritons, and a short spurt of 
offense just before the half indicat-

ed momentum was clearly with 
UCSD. The Bucs, meanwhile, 
seemed to be in disbelief that for . 
the first time all year they went a 
half without scoring. 

\Vith less than a minute remain-
ing in the first half, Hughes was 
fouled at the edge of the CBU penal-
ty box. Her ensuing free kick was 
deflected back to her feet. Hughes 
sent in another cross that appeared to 
hit the hand of a Bucs defender and 
went back to the foot of Hughes. 
Without a call being made, Hughes 
sent in a low cross which, after taking 
a couple of deflections, found the 
foot of Alfredson, who coolly put the 
ball past CBU goalkeeper Jennifer 
Simon. 

\Vith the crowd going wild at 
the apparent goal, the far-side 
linesman stood with his flag raised 
to indicate that a UCSD player was 
offside when the goal was scored. 
Though the game entered halftime 
scoreless, it was obvious this game 
now belonged to UCSD. 

At halftime, Bucs coach Gareth 
O'Sullivan was overheard ripping 
his squad apart with a demoralizing 
tirade laden with expletives. 

"At halftime, I told them they 
can't p13y any worse. Then we 
came out in the second half and 
did," O'Sullivan said. 

Buoyed by the burst at the end 
of the half and the slow realization 
that they were within reach of 
shutting down the best offense in 
the history of collegiate occer, 
UCSD came out firing on all cylin-
ders in the second half. 

Less than three minutes into the 
second half, Megan Mendoza made 
a penetrating run down the left side 
of midfield before being fouled 30 
yards from goal. The CBU defense 
slowly retreated, backs to the ball, 
into the center of the penalty area 
to set up its free kick defense while 
arguing with the referee. A split 
second after the foul, Hughes saw 
the opening on the left side of the

and

box and made a slashing run inro 
the space. Mendoza quickly picked 
out Hughes, who walked in on 
Simon and scored her fourth goal 
of the season. The goal sent the 
Triton Soccer Stadium record 
crowd of 1,645 into pandemonium 
and not only gave the Tritons the 
lead but put CBU behind for the 
first time in over a year. 

"[Taking quick free kicks] is one 
of those things you talk about all 
season long and never happens," 
Hughes said. "Megan saw how open 
I was and just found me quickly." 

It was clear the goal disheart-
ened the Bucs, and they stood little 
chance to equalize. Slowly their 
players began to yell at each other, 
attacking runs seemed to come few 
and far between and other than a 
few long-range shots, nothing 
seemed to trouble sophomore 
goalkeeper Kami Poma. 

Kristin Jones sealed the win for 
the lritons when she capitalized on 
a CBU turnover in the backfield 
and went in one-on-one with 
Simon. J ones put the ball past the 
outstretched hands of the keeper 
for her ninth goal of the season. 

The win was nothing short of 
amazing, and shutting out the Bucs 
was miraculous. 

"We really didn't think anyone 
could keep us from scoring," Gregg 
said after the game, almost aston-
ished at what had just happened. 

"I'm proud of the fact that we got 
here, disappointed that we played 
our worst game in the most impor-
tant one," O'Sullivan said. "We sim-
ply didn't show up to play today. We 
never got into our game because of 
the way they shut us down." 

Cordova explained the team's 
defensive strategy. 

"Our plan was to double Missy 
[Gregg) whenever possible," she 
said. "When we play against three 
forwards, the stopper drops back and 
marks one of the forwards. Today it 
happened to be me marking Missy."

McManus knew he could not 
sacrifice toO much to stop the Bucs. 
Other than moving Cordova back, 
a move that is within normal game 
plan, the Tritons made few changes 
to the style of play that has <:arned

Tritons finish third in the nation 
UCSD advances to Final Four before losing to eventual national champion Barry University 

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Watch out, UCSD women's oc-
cer team. Pretty soon you may not be 
the only UCSD women's fall athletic 
team to wave a national champi-
onship trophy in the air. After travel-
ing to Allendale , Mich. , in late 
November, the UCSD women's vol-
leyball team capped off an incredible 
season by finishing third in the 
nation and one game short of the 
national championship. 

"It was great - I was really 
pleased with the team," said head 
coach Duncan McFarland. "I felt 
they had really overachieved to 
accomplish that this year. I think the 
typical athlete at UCSD is over-
achieving, looking at their goals -
look at the women's soccer team. We 
definitely used [them) as an inspira-
tion and a good role model." 

To reach the Final Four, the 
Tritons faced familiar foes Lock 
Haven and found them tough oppo-
nents, despite readily beating them in 
the beginning of the season. 

"I actually was more concerned in 
that match than any other 0311 year 
long," McFarland said. "1 was confi-
dent we could beat that team and I 
was worried my players were, too -
the biggest concern wa looking past 
them. I just figured [Lock H aven) 
would be very fired up for us and not 
feeling a much pressure against 
them [as we were) . 

The Tritons came out tight, but 
managed to take the first set, 30-26. 

tributed 50 assists, and freshman 
outside hitter Stacey Dunsmore 
smacked 18 kills while leading the 
Tritons to the first-ever Division II 
Final Four. 

With Lock Haven out of the way, 
UCSD took on Barry University the 
next day and lost in straight sets. 
Barry University, who became the 
eventual champions after trouncing 
South Dakota State, had four star 
Brazilian players who gave 
McFarland some consernation, 

"Kids in Brazil have tremendous 
competition down there, and I knew 
they would be a tough team to crack," 
he said. "I could see how good the 
Brazilian players were and they were 
the definite dominant players on the 
team. I felt we had to play the match 
of our life to beat them." 

Dunsmore again led UCSD with 
15 kills and senior Laura Santerre 
added 10 kills, but it simply was not 
enough because Barry, riding a 19-
game winning streak, overpowered 
the Tritons. 

"They were just so solid we 
couldn 't find any weaknesses that we 
could exploit, " McFarland said. "Al l 
our strategies I think would have 
worked aga inst any other team but 
them," 

Despite the loss, McFarland was 
ecstatic about the Tritons' eason, 
which they began ranked below the 
top 25 . 

McFarland was also not surprised 
about their playoff run. 

"I think we just really built on our 
success," McFarland said. "[1 n the 
regional championship game) we just 
took San Bernardino one game at a 
time and kept our goals small at first 
and then built on that. Every time we 
achieved our goal we gained confi-
dence and believed we could go high-
er next time." 

However, despite UCS D 's stellar 
finish, officials onl y ranked the 
Tritons ninth in the last poll, and 
none of the player were named 
national All-Americans. 

"I think it's a bit political," com-
mented McFarland, "because the 
people that do the ranking seem to 
be on the East Coast, since they 
always rank the West Coast teams 
really, really low. Ranking us ninth at 
the end is kind of ridiculous. I think 
our teams have consistently per-
formed well out here '" it's a bit odd 
that we were that low." 

But McFarland doesn 't worry 
about it too much-he is al ready 
preparing for next year. The Tritons 
will lose three seniors: Jamie vVoods, 
Kathleen Hentz and Laura anterre, 
all of whom were integral to the 
team's success last year. 

"It will definitely be rough 
[replacing the graduating seniors]," 
McFarland said, "[But] we have a 
great nucleus of players coming back. 
We had nine fres hmen last year, and 
to get playoff experience and go to 
the Elite Eight is fabulou experience 
for them." 

In addition to his team's excellent 
play, Me arland is quick to credit 
another source for his team's success.

Team Effort: The Tritons ended up third in the nation due to great team 
play, evidenced here in a match played in the fall, 

After Lock Haven then took the 
next set, the Tritons rallied for two 
sets, squeaking by, 30-28 and 30-27, 
for the win. Senior Kathleen Hentz 
posted 10 kills and two blocks, 
freshman setter Teresa Ohta con-

"I thought [going far in the post-
season] was possible at the start 
because I realized how much talent 
we had on the team," he said. "We 
did talk about the possibility of win-
ning a national championship." 

From the beginning, the Tritons 
tried not to look too far ahead. 

"We appreciate the support from 
the students at UCSD that helped us 
go undefeated at home," he said. "I 
don 't think we've ever had that 
before."

Men struggle 
in beginning 
of season 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

After a disappointing season last year, 
the UCSD men 's basketball team has 
already equaled last year's win total. But it 
still has a long way to go before becoming 
contenders. 

After enduring a rough break that saw 
the Tritons go 3-6, they currently stand tied 
for last in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with a 1-5 league record and a 
4-9 overall record. 

At the end of ovember, the Tritons 
traveled north to participate in the Santa 
Cruz Invitational, which also featured 
Holy Names College, UC Santa Cruz and 
Willamette. 

The Tritons drew Holy Names College 
in the first round and easily cruised past the 
Hawks 62-53. Led by senior guard Nick 
Christensen, who finished with 22 points, 
UCSD shot 50 percent from the field and 
had a commanding 35-19 lead by halftime. 
Junior Jody Woods added 12 points to the 
balanced Triton attack.

Tritons seek 

• consistency 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball team 
endured a streaky winter break, going 4-5 
to catapult its overall record to 6-5. 
However, four of the losses the Tritons suf-
fered were against league opponents, leav-
ing UCSD with a 2-4 league record and 
tied for ninth in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

Head coach Judy Malone remained 
optimistic about her players. 

"We're a very young team - we started 
pretty strong and beat some good teams," 
she said. "1 think we're doing ok' for the 
youth of our team. We lost a couple that we 
probably shouldn't have lost, but we're 
going to be young and we're going to be up 
and down." 

On Dec. 9, the Tritons hosted Sonoma 
State in their home opener and fell to the 
Cossacks 52-67. Playing without injured 
point guard Maya Folc, the Tritons commit-
ted 25 turnovers and shot a paltry 31 per-
cent from the field. UCSD was led by fresh-
man Lauren Sargent, who came off the 
bench to pour in 11 points, as well as sopho-

more Ali Ginn, who also contributed 11 
points. 

However, the next night against San 
Francisco State was an entirely different 
story: The Tritons had six players in double 
figures en route to an 80-7 1 overtime victo-
