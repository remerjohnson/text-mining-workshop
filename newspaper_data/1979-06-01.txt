China 
UCSD Pioneers 
Exchange Hopes 
In September 

By Eric Harpell 
Senior Staff Writer 

A part of the scientific and 
cultural exchange between the 

nited States and the People's 
Republic of China begun when 
relations opened up several 
months ago, several UCSD 
faculty members and adminis-
trators, including Chancellor 
McElroy and Scripps chemist 
Jeffery Bada, will travel to 
China later thi year. 

The " first official dele-
gation" from the United States 
to go to China with hopes of 
fo tering an educational 
ex hange will be composed of 
eight UCSD faculty members, 
according to McElroy. They 
will arrive in China ometime 
in September, he said. 

Re ponding to an invitation 
from Chun King University to 
discuss arrangement for 
exchange students and faculty , 
the UCSD delegation will meet 
with Chinese officials at two 
universities , according to 
McElroy. 

The delegation curre ntly 
consists of eight faculty 
member including McElroy. 
However, the Chancellor plans 
to ask permission of the 
Chinese government to include 
Dr. Paul Picowicz of UCSD's 
department of Chinese history. 

Yuan Cheng Fung of UCSD's 
Medical School will accompany 
the delegation through an 
invitation from the Chinese 
government to tour several 
universities , but will not 
participate as a delegate. 

McElroy said the schedule 
calls for stops at seven Chinese 
cities including Peking,' 
Shanghai and Kan Ton. All are 
locations of major universities, 
he said .

UC Vice President Here To 
Assess Administrative Crisis 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

Paul Saltman has accepted 
reappointment to the position of 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs, one week after his 
resignation began an admin-
istrative crisis that threatens to 
force the removal of Chancellor 
William McElroy. 

And, while some professors 
and community members are 
starting to question the wisdom 
and propriety of the Academic 
Senate , UC system Vice 
President William Fretter flew 
into San Diego last night and 
will stay to study the situation 
here through today. 

Saltman, who concluded

negotiations involving himself, 
McElroy and Academic Senate 
Chairman Russell Doolittle 
Wednesday afternoon, returns 
to office at the urging of the 

Gas SupplIes Seen Up 
But Some Companies Promise Reduced Allocations 

By Cindy Beveridge 
Staff Writer 

For some gas station owners 
in the UCSD area , June will 
bring at least temporary relief 
from the recent cutbacks in 
monthly allocations by some of 
the major oil companies. 
, Chevron stations have 
an nounc ed they will be 
appropriated an approximate 
five to ten percent increase in 
the amount of gas alloted them 
for June. 

Some of the area stations, 
however, will be allocated as 
little as 70 percent of the June 
1978 allocations this month. 

Texaco plans to deliver only 
70 percent of what it allocated 
to their dealers last year. Shell 
a nd Mobil will deliver 80 
percent. Arco will supply 85 
percent and Chevron wi11lead 
at 90 percent. 

Adequate supplies of gasoline 
for this month were maintained 
by cutting back hours and 
limiting the amount of gas 
pumped, dealers quoted by the 
Associated Press say . 

While the long-a nticipated 
gas additions may reduce lines 
and keep stations open up 
longer, San Diego drivers can 
continue to expect prices to 
increase. 

The cost of a gallon of gas in 
this area rose an average of two 
cents in a two-week period, a 
Guardian survey shows. Of the 
15 stations questioned, only two 
have managed to maintain the 
same price in the latter half of 
May. 

Station managers attribute 
the increa ed price to th 
recent panic in California 

when demand multiplied from 
driver "topping off" their 
filled tanks . 

The panic also might have 
been the result of Carter's 
proposal last month to lift the 
federally imposed ceiling on 
gas prices. Carter has recently 
commented that such a plan 
would discourage consumption 
and would stimulate domestic 
research and development of 
alternate sources of eneq~y . 

The plan was to have gone 
into effect this month, but is 
currently facing opposition in 
Congre s. Two weeks ago the 
House Democratic Caucus 
voted 138 -69 to continue 

enforcement of the ceiling. 
Despite the increased June 

allotment for some gas 
stations, managers are 
operating with as much as a 30 
percent reduction in gasoline 
supplies as compared to last 
year at this time . For some

stations cuts are expected to get 
larger. 

"A lot of stations are getting 
more gas this month ," said

AS Council Rescinds 
Rec Vote Opposition 

By Pat Domowitz 
Staff Writer 

After two hours of deliber-
ation the AS Council Wednes-
day rescinded its disapproval 
of the upcoming recreation 
facilities referendum. 

The council last week 
recommended postponement of 
the referendum, scheduled 
June 6 and 7, citing vagueness 
in the marshall's charter, poor 
pre-referendum publicity and a 
lack of procedures for 
conducting and regulating the 
vote and its tabulation. 

The revised marshalls ' 
charter approved Wednesday 
clarified the mechanism by 
which a referendum may be 
brought to the mar hall ' board 

a nd provided for written 
guidelines, to be prepared by 
the board , which govern the 
conduct of referenda. 

Proceduresused forthe 
January daycare center 
referendum will be in effect for 
the next week's vote, according 
to Mike Elcan , graduate 
student council representative 
to the recreation facilities 
committee. 

The AS, which formerly had 
absolved Commmissioner of 
Elections Bruce Napell from 
involvement in the upcoming 
referendum, named Napell its 
representative to the mar-
shalls' board, which will 
conduct the referendum.

assurances from McElroy that 
the structure of his office would 
be as it was May 6, the day 
before McElroy took the Dean 
of Graduate Studies and 
Research from Saltman's aegis 
and placed it under his own. 

The Academic Senate 's 
Committee on Committees will 
now appoint a committee of 
faculty , administration and 
students to discuss the transfer 
of the office to the chancellor' 
authority, as set forth in the 
chancellor 's speech to the 
Senate Tuesday. 

. 'I'm a great believer in peer 
review ," Saltman said 
yesterday. " I believe every-
body should be evaluated by 
their peers ... thechancellor, the 
vic chancellors, professor , 
provo ts, down the line. This i 
perfectly acceptable to me." 

Review of the switch is 
expected to la t well into the

and administrators about the 
cor.flict that has enveloped the

this afternoon at 5: 30 in the 
Urey Room of Urey Hall . 

Fretter is to advise the 
president on whether a 
committee should be formed to 
investigate UCSD's crisis , after 
Saxon was requested to do so by 
Professor Martin Kamen, one 
of McElroy ' s most ardent 
supporters.

Naming Elections 
Boycott Urged 
Editor: 

Recently , there has been a 
Ireat deal of non-excitement 
over the naming of " The Third 
College." Whv , is a question 
which has many answers. 

In the beginning came the 
naming assemblies in which 
only 30 to 40 students 
participated, leaving much to 
be desired. Regarding this, 
things to remember are 1) lack 
of publicity, 2). location, why 
they were held at HL, away 
from The Third College is 
baffllnl and 3) confusion 
amone the "orlanizers" of the 
assembly led to madness at the 
asaembUes. Provost Watson, 
where were you? 

Next carne the first bBllot 
which incidentally among the 
leVen names on the ballot, 
Lumumba-Zapata was one of. 
Even thOUlh Lumumb.Zapata 
w .. the name mOlt preferred at 
the namlne ... mblles, the 
Third Collele Council reluc-
tantly placed it on the ballot. 
Provost Wataon. where were 
you? 

Now th~ next step should 
have been to place the top three 
vote getters on the next ballot, 
yet what followed was anything 
but that . Lumumba-Zapata . 
althoulh It recei,ved more votes 
than anyone else, except one, 
was not placed on the second 
ballot. The Third College 
Council did not like Lumumba-
Zapata so they did not place it 
on the ballot; this is strange 
because we thought that the 
Council represented the 
students. not the Regents . 
Provost Watson, where were 
you? 

All thi brings us to the 
present. We now know where 
Provost Watson was : he was 
busy telling the media that 
students at UCSO are lucky to 
even have a vote. Now we all 
know exactly where he 's 
coming from . 

Even though we now have the 
chance to vote down the name 
"Third" (remember this is only 
a number, 3rd, not a concept) , 
voting in this so-called election 
would only serve to legitimize 
what has taken place. The 
madness, confusion and total 
lack of sensitivity for students 
has led us, the undersigned. to 
urge all students to BOYCOTT 
the Third College naming 
election, and furthermore. we 
will henceforth refer to 
ourselves proudly as 
Lumumba-Zapata College

UCSD's Academic Failings 
Cause Student Transiency 

Students Sour Because Chosen Field Unavailable 
In a recent commentary 

printed in the Guardian, 
Andrew Schneider places 
blame on the students for the 
low quality of life at UCSD. He 
states that students drop into 
UCSD, decide they can't handle 
it, and then proceed to transfer 
elsewhere. He then continues 
an article woven with 
falsehoods that paints an 
inaccurate picture of the life at 
UCSD. 

Sure. it's a fact that the 
students at UCSD are on the 
move - just getting here or just 
leaving - but the reason 60 
percent of the freshmen 
entering UCSD eventually 
leave is because of academics. 
Andy Schneider glosses over 

this fact and in doing so builds a 
faulty foundation for his 
erroneous thesis. A recent 
article on the attrition rate at 
UCSD points out that the main 
reason people leave (answered 
on a questionnaire handed out 
with the intercampus transfer 
application) is that they cannot 
find appropriate courses suited 
to their interests at UCSD. 

with contented students that 
ate achieving their olVn goals 
and experimentine with 
different subjects . then 
naturally the people will enjoy 
the whole college experience a 
lot more. UCSD is filled instead 
with unhappy people frustrated 
with the system. Su re, there are 
students that are happy, but 
they seem to represent the 
minority. 

Montalvo In Questionable Ad 

There is no business school at 
UCSD. There are no nursing 
programs and very few whole 
animal biology courses . The 
undergraduate seeking to 
experiment with science 
courses has a very difficult 
time finding regular intro-
ductory biology courses that do 
not require a year of chemist ry 
as a prerequisite . There is no 
English major available a t 
UCSO as tl\ere is at countless 
other universiti es. There are 
programs in clinical psy-
chology, the main emphasi 
being experimental. 

Schneider remarks " What 
a bout students who are 
unwilling to leave the library to 
participate?" Isn' t that the 
purpose of going to college, to -; 
learn ? Don 't students who pay 
for their education try to do the 
best they can? And doe n' t this 
usually require studying? It 
seems to me that if a student is 
unhappy because he knows he 
can ' t or won't graduate from 
UCSD , he may as well attempt 
to get the best grades he ca n 
and concentrate on trans-
ferra ble genera I education 
requirements. If you aS k I think 
you' ll find that most of the 
transfers are doing just tha t. 
They have no des ire to 
pa rticipate in a college from 
which they are not graduating.

out of context.we would like 
him to explain his position. 

Southwestern is a door-to-
door book sales company . The 
company teaches well-
rehearsed, high pressure sa les 
tactics to be used on people who 
neither want nor can afford the 
overpriced books . South-
western ' s student-salesmen 
operate in predominantly rural 
and socio -economically . 
disadvantaged areas. The ad in 
question is clearly designed to 
attract people who cherish 
money more than personal 
integrity, or as Time put it as 
quoted by Southwestern, "cash 
rather than cachet." 

In light of Carlos ' socially 
concerned stands on such 
issues as di~estiture , student 
involvement in University 
affairs and the daycare issue. 
one wonders what couid 
motivate him to endorse such 
an operation. Southwestern is 
clearly an unethical company, 
even a perfunctory examin-
ation will show this. We hope 
that Carlos will make his 
position clear as quickly as 
possible.

Humanities, as opposed to

people transferring within the

these chools offer wider 
curricula, more choice. and 
therefore more room to look

I would like to disavow any 

involvement in the Academic 
Senate's vote of no confidence 
in Chancellor McElroy. I bave 
not encouraged this activity, 
althou,h. admittedly, this vote 
is an obvious attempt to draft 
me as Chancellor, While It is 
true I declared my candidacy 
for chancellor eipt weeks ago 

(I was inadvertently placed in 
the presidential race), 
McElroy has of late become

New Z-·R Gov't Carter Plan Dead Brown Budget Up 

SALISBURY. Zimbabwe Rhodesia (AP)-Prime 
Minister Abel Muzorewa ushered in the new state of 
Zimbabwe Rhodesia at the stroke of midnight today, 
declaring it' 'the victorious minute we have struggled 
for and waited for over 88 years of colonial domination 
alld subjugation ." 

The brief radio and television address by the 
country's first Black prime minister, along with a 
government gazette proclamation, were the only 

_ oCficial acts marking the inception of the new 
state- which was saddled from birth with 
international isolation, escalating civil war and 
factional rivalries, 

" This is Friday, June 1. 1979, this is theday the Lord 
has made, let us rejoice and be extremely glad," 
began Muzorewa, a 54-year-old bishop of the United 
Methodist Chureh. . 

He promised " sober and decent leadership" and 
fervently apeated for national unity: " I ask you to 
devote all you physical. mental and spiritual energies 
to aChi~Ve{ .In -tilis. wonderful land of ours a oneness' 
which will 00 the e'nVy -of" the whole world. " 

The gazette proclamation ended the 15-year white-
minority.acjministrat-ion o£Prime Ministel1 Ian Smith 
and officially .• trans(erre$l ' government yowers to 
Muzorewa'- and his Cabinet of lJ blacks and five 
whites. The new ministers will be sworn in today, with 
Smith '!io~ a' mirri~~r-without-portfolio . , . 

But in the last hours before the tra nsfer, informed 
ources spi d nationalist guerrillas had been warning 

bla.ck' in rural v.i1lages a nd towns to tay indoors. 
And in Salisbury, the rift between Muzorewa and 

his former partner in the 14-month tran itional 
gover::..nent ; the Rev . dabaningi Sithole, widened 
with 'police det~ntions of at least eleven officials of 
Sitbole.'s Zimbabwe African National Union. 

Sithole has charged that April's parliamentary 
elections were rigged a nd he i boycotti ng the new 
government. He made the allegations afte r his pa rty 
was overwhelmed by Muzorewa 's United Africa n 
Nationa l Co uncil in the elections.

WASHINGTON (AP) - In a major blow to 
President Carter's anti-inflation program, a federal 
judge ruled yesterday that Carter has overstepped his 
constitutional power in trying to enforce his wage-
price guidelines. 

U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker said he 
neither the Constitution nor Congress gave Carter 
authority to threaten to deny federal contracts to 
companies that violate his " voluntary" guidelines. 

The decision does not prevent tile president from 
using his influence - " benign jawboning" in the 
judge's words - to obtain purely voluntary support 
for his guidelines from business and labor. 

25 DC-10's Still Out

cleared for take-off. 

A United Airlines mechanic said yesterday that 
deficiencies found in one nC-lo were so severe that if 
they had gone undetected, an engine eventually might 
have dropped off the aircraft.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The OC-IOboltfoundon the

"The boll had broken in an overstress condition, 
rather than a fa tigue condition," Michael Mark, 
chief metallurgist for the ational Tran portation 
Safety Board told the board in a briefing. 

"As far a can be ascerta ined so fa r, the bolt broke

that includes $983 million more than originally

The Ways and Means Committee's action set the

Fretter began his meetings 
last night at the La Valencia 
Hotel , where he is staying, 

George Gildred, a member of 
the Board of Overseers, a group 
of donors to the univers ity . has 
gotten 1 18 signatures on a letter 
to David Saxon expressing 
that group 's " unqu a lified 
support" for McElroy, 

Gildred, who says the letter 
was spurred by " negative" 
press coverage of the 
chancellor's problems, also 
urged Saxon to send down a 
representative to examine the 
situation because of what he 
believes are confusing reports 
from different faculty and 
observers, 

The letter, from a " broad 
based group of San Diegans," 
says that McElroy " has grown

in stature, respect a nd 
community ... and has become a 
strong community leader." 

Though opposed to the 
resolution, Gildred says no 
Board members will lobby 
professors during the mail 
vote. 

Tuesday's vote has drawn 
fire [rom within the academic 
community, too. 

Kamen has charged that the 
voting was improperly and 
unfairly conducted. 

He says that no sergeant at 
arms was present, which 
allowed non-academic person-
nel to vote, 

" I saw students and people 
who were not professors 
voting ... there· was an atmos-
phere of confusion. Professors 
were not asked for proper 
identification," Kamen says. 

His view is supported by 
severa I professors who say 
they saw staff members vote , 

Kamen argues that a roll call 
should have been taken, or at 
least that only a mail vote 
should have been held, 

Cicourel , who helped pass out 
the ballots, dismisses that 
argument, saying that the few 
votes tha t might have been cast 
illegally could not have altered 
the count. 

Questions over the parlia· 
mentary legality of conducting 
a vote last Tuesday instead of 
next week have also been 
ra ised, 

It is argued by some that the 
resolution of no confidence was 

"new business," and thus not 
eligible for a vote its first time 
before the full Senate, 

Cicourel says, however, that 
the Senate voted to include the 
resolution as part of the 
Executive and Policy Commit.-
tee report, thus making a vote 
possible. 

With controversy over the 
Senate vote building, the 
mailing of ballots to each of the 
professo r s s hould begin 
Monday or Tuesday, the Senate 
office said yesterday. 

Votes should be in and 
tabulated by the end of finals 
week,

released during finals week,

Although panic has subsided

UCSD Frustrating to Deaf Students 

By Jolla HoDdr. 
Ailed ... News EdllGl' 

Life bill become much easier 
for Cyrus Colburn since he left 
UCSD Iut year. 

As ODe of the few deaf 
studentl bere, Colburn claims 
he had to make "dozens of 
counselinl and doctor appoint-
ment. to cope with tbe 
preaaures." 

On the other hand, carol 
Padden, a first year lI"aduate 
student ia IJncut.tica. said her 
experience 88 a deaf student at 
UCSD hal been ",enerally 
poIitjve." 

"I don't expect much from 
my prafes.ors," remarked 
Padden. "Tbe leIS you expect, 
the len you're disappointed." 

There are currently two deaf 
studentland Dve with impaired 
bearln, at UCSD. In an 
interview with Tile Guardian, 
Colburn said that when he came 
here in 1974, there were no 
services provided for the deaf. 
"There were 00 interpreters, 
no notetakers or tele-
typewriter phones available," 
he commented. 

According to Randy 
Woodard, director of Disabled 
Student Services, deaf students 
did not apply -to UCSD until 
very recently. 

.. About 1976, the iasue of 
educatlOl the deaf came up 
more than it ever had," said 
Woodard. 

Sioce then, DSS has worked 
toward maltiDl the . campus 
more accessible to the deaf, 
accordlOl to Woodard. "The 
Wllveraity has been lood about 
provldin, notetakers and 
interpreters for deaf students," 
be said. 

Under the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973 (Section ' 504 of the 
Facilities Transportation 
Plao), the university is 

required to provide program-
matic accessibility for 
handicapped students (this 
includes furnisoiDl notetakers 
and Interpreters at no cost to 
the deaf student). 
. Padden said these services 
aren't just handed to handi-
capped students. "You have to 
demand things if you want to 
get somewhere," she said. 

According to Woodard, the 
Rehabilitation law is not a 
.. free ride" through the 
university for bandicapped 
students. Woodard said he

"never supported 504 because 
there were no appropriations 
behind it - without the money 
you can't implement these 
services. " 

He also criticized the 
Rehabilitation law for being too 
limited - "504 ' just includes 
programmatic accessibility, 
not physical." 

Visual Laa,ua,e 
Padden, who did her 

undergraduate study at 
Georgetown University in 
Washington, DC, said she is 
interested in the fairly new 
study of sign syntax. "I decided 
to do my graduate work at 
UCSD because of its good 
Linguistics department and 
because of its location near the 
Salk Institute," she remarked. 

Padden said she is con-
centrating on how the 
syntactical structure of visual 
language can be compared to 
the auditory. Salk is the largest 
grant-supported research 
facility in this field , she said. 

Padden, whose family is also 
deaf, attended public schools 
since shewas in the third grade. 
Although she has limited 
hearing , Padden c laims that 
her peers were "misinformed 
about her capabilities ." 

" I experienced frustrations 

in school when I was young, but 
I could always go home and talk 
with my parents. The main 
basis of support came from my 
family," said Padden. . 

Padden can speak, and is 
able to hear on a one-to-one 
basis. However, a classroom 
situation is different, she said. 
"I couldn't imagine going 

. through school without a sign 
interpreter," commented 
Padden. 

Colburn, who received his BA 
in Visual Arts here last year, is 
currentlY..ja professional 

~otogra pher. 
Colburn was not born deaf, 

but has suffered a gradual loss 
of hearing. He divides his time 
between .reading lips, writing 
and sign language when 
communicating. 
Professors Don't Communicate 

Colburn said that notetakers 
have eliminated only part of the 
problem, because most faculty 
and staff members were 
unwilling to communicate with 
him. 

Colburn cited a case where 
one Biology professor refused 
to make a class accessible to 
him by putting the lecture notes 
on reserve. " The professor told 
me th a t much of th e grade

'Special Report: Tenure 
Tenure Labyrin,h 'Tries For Fairness' 

Doubts Over Secrecy, Student Input Reflect Process' Importance 
The following special report is the result of 

many weeks' research into the tenure 
process at UCSD. We found that the more 
we investigated, the less straightforward it 
seemed. The more people we questioned. the 
less consistent were their answers. As one 
junior faculty member put it , "There's a lot of 
schizophrenia in the ivory towers ... 

In our excursion through the muddle, we 
were struck by one case in particular which 
we think illustrates th e reason there are so 
many questions abou t the process. Mike 
Real, of the c~ntrouersial communications 
program, was denied tenure fo r inadequate 
scholarship. He says others in his field are 
inevitably surprised to hear that he has not 
been given tenure yet. His status was 
illustrated by his selection for the editorial 
committee of the most prestigious journal in 
th e field, the Jo.r •• ' 01 C .... 
munications, this year, Real told the 
Guardian. You can see why we were 
intrigued. 

What fo llows is by no means the whole 
story. Some information is simply not 
auailable, or so we were told. But this should 
provide a bet ter insight into what is going on 
in there while students are Ivrking on the 
sidelines, scratchin ,! tI ,, ·/ · heads; wishing to 
do somet hing, but not 'lowing where to 
begin.

How The Review Process Works 
Th e tenure pro c ess I S 

ex traordinarily c omplex and 
.:onfusing. Few people understand 
fully how it warks, including many 
whose involvement is very close. 
The/allowing is but a brief outline of 
the tenure process, as much as 
space al/ows. 

Assistant professors are 
a ppointed to two-year terms, 
and at the end of each term, the 
profes or ' s dep a rtment 
conducts a n evalua tion of his or 
her performance in the areas of 

teaching , re se a r c h , a nd 
university/community se rvice. 

If a tenure review is in order, 
usually in the 6th year , the 
depa rtment soli c its lette rs 
from outside experts in the 
ca ndidate' s field . As dictated 
by the " Horowitz Rule ," 
which were instated in 1977 to 
a llow th e candidate morc 
access to his or her file, the 
depa rtment must solicit a 
" reasona ble number" (usually 
two) from five individua l on a 

" 

list provided by the candidate. 
A committee of te nured 

members of the department 
sends a recommendation to the 
Office of Academic P er onnel. 

After making sure that all 
procedure ha ve been correctly 
followed , the offi ce sends 
copie or the file to both the 
Provos t of the ca ndida te 'S 
c ollege a nd th e Dea n of 
Gradua te Studie . who review 
the file with teaching and 
service in mind . 

The candidate's fil e is then 
I submitted to the Committee on 

Academic Personnel (CAP) , a 
sta nding sub-committee of the 
Academic Se nate, comprised or 
eight tenured fa culty mem-
bers. The CAP reviews the file 
and s ubmits to the vice 
cha ncellor a list of suggested 
na mes for a fi ve-member Ad 
Hoc committee, formed for the 
purpo e of e va lua ting the 
s pecific ca ndidate. If the vice 
cha ncellor feels that any of the 

na mes , or a lte rnates , sug-
g e sted b y th e C AP is 
unsui ta ble, he may reject itand 
ask the committee for another 
recommendation. 

Once the Ad Hoc committee 
makes its recommendation, the 
CAP review the file and 
submits its own recommenda-
tion to the vice cha ncellor for 
the final decision. 

If a candidate is denied 
te nure. he or she mu t be given 
a one year notice.

Despite this tri-Ievel scrutiny, nearly 
86 percent of professors seeking a second 
contract are successful , according to 
Alpert. An even higher percentage of 
faculty, 94 percent, are reappointed for a 
third contract term, he said. 

Still, the review system guarantees 
that no professor will be reappointed 
"solely because of one reason ," 
commented Alpert. 

Alpert suggested that the college's

Yet another alternative to the trad-

Although a few faculty members are

toward musical maturity.

Most striking in this 
performance was the musical 
development of the group. The 
solos were on a part with 
contemporary Jazz musicians 

on both a creative and a 
technical level. The solos of 
Wakeman on the mini moog 
were somewhat reminiscent of 
RTF keyboardist Chick Corea.;

this was a rock concert. I was

reminded of that fact from the 
moment I entered the building. 
Even before the lights went out 
the haze was so thick that the 
million dollar stage was barely 
in view . "You could get high 
breathing," I said to myself, 

hyperventilating. The moving 
scenery , sparsely clothed, 
sporting natural rather than 
synthetic beauty, kept the mind 
engaged . This was an 
anniversary celebration in the 
California tradition. The 
atmosphere was that of a party, 
with one exception . The band 
playing was no party band. This 
was a musical entourage as 
seasoned in their role as the 
30,000 or so in attendence were 
in theirs . 

It seems like eons since their 
historic performance a t the 
Hollywood Bowl. where J first 
encountered Yes live . 

But unlike most rock groups, 
Yes had matured as well . In the 
process, Yes had begun to 
destroy the oldest of rock 
truism , for here was a band 
that had grown old with grace 
and dignity , a band ready to 
assume a position as a revered 
rock patriarch. The field of 
serious music has traditionally 
been one in which performers 
could hold a lifelong role. Yet in 
rock, this type of rela tion-
ship had been conspicuously 
absent. The Yes concert in th e 
round , however, gave me the 
impression that rock mu ic i a 
serious art form and that Yes is 
to be a focal point in the 
co ntinua tion o f t he roc k 
tradition.

Such is the discerning

anniversary of the San Diego 
Comic Convention. It will be 
held during August 2-August 5 
at both the U.S. Grant Hotel and 
the Convention and Performing 
Arts Center. The hours are 
from 9 am to wh~never the 
visitor cares to leave. Since the 
convention is a non-profit 
organization. membership fees 
are required. They are divided 
into two categories. The first is 
daily attending membership, 
in which a person attends the 
convention only. The price is 
$4.00 and must be paid at the 

door. The ·second is full 
a ttending membership, in 
which a person attends the 
convention, works in it, votes 
for the board of directors and 
recei ves progress reports of the 

me~tings through the mail. 
These are paid by mail. From 
now until June 30, a person can 
become a full attending 
member at a price of $12.00. 
After that date , the fee 
increases to $15.00. The latter 
cost can also be paid at the 
door . Its origins can be traced to the summer of 1970, when the 

convention made its debut at 
the US Grant Hotel in 
downtown 'San Diego. Other 
sites have been Muir College, 
the EI Cortez Hotel and the 
Sheraton Inn at Harbor Island. 
In terms of attendence, the 
number has risen from a mere 
seventy to a. <;urrent total of 
5,500. Visitors have hailed from 
all parts of the United States. In

president, Shel Dorf, " plan

Art as Sport Alongside Sport as Art 
Tbere is a regulation 

baaketball backstop Installed In 
Mandeville Art Gallery; 
beaeath it is a free throw lane 
aDd Ufe slze sports garbed 
croucblng figure of artist Brad 
Stensberg, w~.o along with 
artists Bill Mosley and 
Elizabeth Gubeen are exhi-
biting their joint MFA (Mastof 
Fine Arts) sbow scheduled to 
run thJ"OUlh June 15 in the UCSD 
Gallery. 

Vitality jaunts throughout 
the show. Bill Mosley's better 
than life size Two Skaten seem 
exuberantly headed for the 
gallery door, while a small 

collie-like dog leaps and 
catches a frisbee in a separate 
painting beside thein. These 
hUie oils on paper seem painted 
directly on the walls, 
giving them an almost mon~ 
lithic character. Vigorous 
brush strokes and flat color 
patches capture the vital 
impact of a first sketch in 
monumental scale . Subject 
matter is less monumental, 
dealing with scenes of the 
artist's casual southern 
California lifestyle, his friends, 
and pastimes. One untitled 
piece is indeed like a scrapbook 
page including friendly 
conversations, staged humor, 

swimming pool shots and studio 
candids. 

"GeUing Straight." a 
finalization for a smaller 
series, flatly depicts a modern 
Don Juan, the shape of whose 
head is echoed in the flat black 
doorway behind him. Even 
stronger in size and personality 
is Deer Hun&ers, including a 
self-portrait of the artist; 
Mosley uses this context to 
reach into his past for 
autobiographical imagery. The 
humorously hostile figures 
posed amid serene trees and 
actually cut out, flickering 
leaves: the aggressive stares on 
the faces of the subjects belie 

the calmness of the setting. success diagram, and souvenir 
T-shirts installing the artist ina 
personal fantasy of super 
stardom.A statement on the 
wall informs the viewer: "Brad 
Nowhere Man Stensberg has 
been so tremendous in this 
series, coming out of nowhere 
to become the Cinderella oC the 
Cinderella t~am . An isolated 
camera has been added to try 
and capture the moves of this 
tremendous player! .. 

r Around Towill 

Elizabeth Guheen also works 
in large scale; her map-like 
paintings have been described 
as 75% abstraction and 25% 
representation . She states that . 
her goals are not narrative or 
depiction : " [ work and keep 
painting over, trying for 
luminous color, enjoying the 
(un 0( ' drawing ... until it 
reaches a point where it feels 
"finished." HergreytonalKlng 
of tbe Rain Country, with its 
underlying chalk drawn 
airfield and planes succeeds 
best in achieving the artist's 
aesthetic goals . However, it is 
di(ficult not to read messages 
into the abstract expressionist 
style pieces such as Soup Farm, 
an aerial view of cultivated 
land in pea soup green and 
dehydrated carrot orange, with 
flattened cardboard houses, all 
bringing to mind our prepack-
aged society and over-
processed eating habits. This 
vies for attention with the 
expressive brush strokes as ' 
well as the tonal and spacial 
attributes of the work. 

The moves are indeed 
captured in video films 
bouncing scenes ranging from 
a basketball continously 
spinning on Stensberg's finger 
to the slickly commercial disco 
dunk, practice interviews and 
locker room shots; there is also 
a tape of an actual Seattle 
Sonics championship game, 
complete with commercials. 
The cacophony of cheers, pep 
talks, and sports interviews 
rebounding from the four 
simultaneously playing videos 
creates a genuine atmosphere 
of the stadium and home 
viewed game. 

University Events and K-105 
FM present The Last DiICO, 
perhaps the most spectacular 
entertainment event to happen

place in the Blue Aragon 
Ballroom (formerly the Main

feature will be a dance contest, 

with several thousands of 
dollars of prizes being awarded 
to everyone who enters. Also, 
there will be fashion shows by 
the renowned Roberts and 
Company, and floor shows and 
dance lessons by Le Disco 
Espree. The Last Disco is 
Saturday, June 2nd, 9 pm, in the 
Blue Aragon Ballroom. Tickets 
are $3.50 for students, and $5 .50 
for general admission, and are

Special Report: Tenure 
Tenure Process Fairness Questioned 

(Continued trom page 8) 
although the tenure system is fair in 
pr inciple, it is not so in act ual 
representation, weighting and ana lysis 
of performa nce. 

"Fifty-two percent of the Third College 
faculty is non-tenured, compared to a 
campus-wide average of thirty percent." 
In APIS, AMES and math there is not one 
Black or Chicano faculty member and 
th ere is no effort on the campus to get 
one," Watson notes. 

The lack of faculty members, tenured 
or not, who are representative of Third 
Co llege's concerns makes Cor a lack oC 
proper representation on the various 
co mmittees throughout the whole 
procedure, Watson says. 

Third College Communications 
Professor Mike Real , denied tenure Cor 
the third time this 'year after exhausting 
every means of fighting the decision, 
points out that this could be because 
tenure "reviews are usually done by a 
small society of white male 
comfortables. The likelihood that they're 
aware of alternatives to their view of the 
world is low ." 

Provosts at the three other college 
expressed general satisfaction with the 
tenure process. Provost John Stewart of 
Muir College feels that , relatively 
speaking, the tenure proce s at UC i 
extraordinarily fair and open . " Because 
of the tenure track y tem whereby 
every assistant professor is evaluated on 
his or her own merits and not compared 
to others, junior Caculty member don ' t 
try to undercut each other, but they help 
each other," Stewart says. 

Stewart ad mits that the system is not 
without its fl aws. "No human system is 

going to work perfectly ," he says. which he is not aware. " Bull try to look at

confidence in the thoroughness of the Stewart concurs, commenting that it is

Watson, however, believes that there since 1976, says that with the high degree 
are probably departmental politics of of ecrecy, "The image that comes to 

mind is of Kafka's castle. This remote, 
impregnable fortress is aCCecting your 
life, but you have no control over it. You 
don't know what's being done in this 
black box between the department and 
the final recommendation." 

The " Little-Roberti Act" (Senate Bill 
251) , a provision of the University 
Practicing Act of 1977, would all ' but 
eliminate the strict confidentiality under 
which a candidate's file is kept. 

Were the Little-Roberti Act a pproved, 
the only secrecy maintained would be the 
names of those serving on the Ad Hoc 
committee. Also, the signatures from 
ext ramural letters would be deleted. 
Everything else would be available to the 
candidate . 

The University of California is 
currently fighting the bill on the grounds 
that it i a direct violation of the 
Constitution of California, which states 
that the legislature shall not interfere in 
matters of uni versity personnel 
decisions. According to Parker, "the 
University's case is watertight and 
specific. " 

Parker, who after three years of 
serving on CAP has read the file of each 
faculty member at least once, sees strict 
confidentiality as the only means of 
maintaining candor in the peer 
evaluations. 

Parker is not alone in his support of 
strict confidence. Stewart says that 
"confidentiality is e sential for honest 
opinions." He adds, though, that if a 
candidate were to ask him what his 
eva luation had been, he would tell him or 
her. in nearly the same words he uses in 
his written recommendations. (Please turn to page 14)

there really is no issue, then the case goes 
IlO'further. 

If a candidate feels that he or she has 
been discriminated against (a violation 
of due process) , the candidate may 
introduce witnesses into the case. If a 
lawsuit is filed , says Chodorow, the 
University usually does it all over again. 
"The people up there would really like to 
do it fairly ." 

The prospect of being denied tenure 
has junior faculty members scared 
because, as assistant professor of history 
Robert Edelman puts it, "There are no 
jobs out there." Edelman, a very popular 
professor whose case has received a 
great deal of attention since his 
department gave him a negative 
recommendation, said, " In the 80s being 
denied tenure doesn ' t mean you hopofCto 
another job with your wife trailing you. 
The fact is, my career could be ended by 
this decision and my personal liCe 
severely disrupted." In seven years, 
Edelman says, only three positions have 
opened up ,in his specialized field, 
Russian history. 

Real , on the other hand, states that he 
has " turned down bunches of offers for 
positions elsewhere," including the chair 
of programs at other universities. Why 
does he stay. "In the face of a lot of crap? 
Two reasons," he says. "One is San Diego 
- I like it here. The other is the students 
- I'm committed to them. 

"( could have a lot more money. and 
supportive wo rking conditions

Ree Vote Passes AS 
facilities committee. 

Alternatives To Tenure (Conlinued from page 1) 
Students will be asked to 

approve a $5 per quarter per 
student fee to fund a proposed 
$1,006,000 recreation facility 
which will include a swimming 
pool with jacuzzi, ra(.'quetball 
courts, night lighting on Muir 
Field and a jacuzzi at the 
Natatorium. 

The fee will cover construc-
tion and maintenance costs, 
according to the recreations 

TheAS approval of the 
referendum is contingent upon 
25 percent of the student body 
participating and two-thirds 
approval from that partici-
pating group. 

Polls for the vote will be in the 
Muir, Third and Revelle plazas, 
at the University and medical 
school bookstores and at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceano-
graphy snack bar . . 

Deafness Trial Here 
(Continued from pale 6) 
depended on verbal work and 
understanding," said Colburn. 

Colburn criticized the 
Biology professors for being too 
alienating. " I had to go to all the 
professors forevery class to tell 
them about deafness. There 
wasn't any communication 
between them." 

This lack of communication 
within the department led 
Colburn to change his major 
from Biology to Visual Arts 

after three years. 
Padden commented that the 

faculty in the Linguisitics 
department were "generally 
surprised" when they dis-
covered she was deaf. "Some 
felt awkward for a while , but 
they got used to it." 

Colburn aid the only part he 
misses about UCSD -are the 
students - " they were 
receptive and had no negative 
feelings toward deafness. II 

(unlinu('d (rom pagt' 9) 
professors undergo a some-
what elaborate process before 
being considered for reappoint· 
ment, aid Hahn. 

Faculty eva luation is a 
continuous process at Ever-
green, according to Hahn. Each 
professor receives evaluation 
(rom their students at the end of 
every academic term, which is 
included in a portfolio all 
professors are required to 
maintain. 

Portfolios are also sup-
plemented with evaluations 
submitted by each faculty 
member 's "team," which 
usually consists of several 
other professors, said Hahn. 

After a preliminary portfolio 
evaulation by an individual 
academic dean, the final 
decision on the candidate is 
made by the four deans 
co llectively , according to 
Hahn. 

Although the reappointment 
system is .. cumbersome, " it 

works well and helps " keep 
faculty more alive," remarked 
Hahn . " It 's a ~ery highly 
evaluated system," she 
explained. "They can't create 
an appointment out of cloth." 

But Bill Hucks, '8 student 
leader at Evergreen, charged 
that "the evaluation system 
doesn't work. " 

" It 's merely a matter of the 
opinion of the peers," explained 
Hucks. "There's no (ormal 
process on what to do with 
student eva I ua tions of facul ty. " 

Hucks said it is .. almost 
unheard of for someone not to 
be rehired" and commented 
that he would like to see 
changes in the system which 
" would take away some of the 
flexibility of political 
maneuverings ... 

However, Huck noted that 
Evergreen allows more student 
input in the evaulation proces 
than most college and said 
" the idea of not having tenure i 
excellent. "

Universities such as UC 
would probably not be able to 
implement a system similar to 
Evergreen's because of a lack 
of team teaching and because 
of the departmentaliza tion of 
the faculty , Hahn said. 

" If it's to work well , facu lty 
have to be very familiar with 
one another'S teaching," she 
explained.
