Students Study in Quiet 
Protest at State Capitol

Beach Town Murder Case Hits S.D. CourtREGENTS 
OK EXEC  
SALARY 

INCREASES
By Yelena Akopian
Staff Writer

Facing state budget cuts, the UC 
Board of Regents Committee on 
Compensation voted on May 15 to 
approve a series of compensation 
packages for over a dozen individ-
ual staff members throughout the 
university system, including several 
UCSD employees.

Among the items approved were 
requests for stipend extensions, new 
hires, promotions and appointments 
as well as several salary increases. 

Items approved for UCSD fac-
ulty included a stipend extension 
for Dean of Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies Peter F. Cowhey for his 
additional duties as acting associ-
ate vice chancellor of international 
affairs and appointment salaries for 
Dean of the Division of Arts and 
Humanities Seth Lerer and Vice 
Chancellor of External Relations 
Debra G. Neuman.

Supporters of the decision 
stressed the importance of provid-
ing salaries that are competitive 
with those of comparable universi-
ties in order to preserve staff qual-
ity and attract top talent. Regents 
favoring of the increases pointed 
out that compensation levels at the 
UC system are currently far from 
competitive with comparable public 
or private universities. 

However, university officials 
acknowledged the challenge of sup-
plementing staff compensation in 
light of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
budget proposal for the 2008-09 
school year, which includes a 10-per-
cent cut to higher education.

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said the 
regents maintain the continued 
hope that the final state budget will 
be more accommodating to salary 
increases and other UC needs.

“We hope the final state budget 
recognizes the importance of main-
taining competitive compensation 
for all employees,” he said. 

Also at its Wednesday meeting, the 
regents’ subcommittee that manages 
financial issues named the maintenance 
of competitive salaries as a key justifica-
tion for increased student fees.

“We are supportive of keeping 
staff salaries at market value, but 
we’re hoping that this doesn’t have 
to be on the backs of students and 
that they can get this money from the 
state or somewhere else,” University 
Affairs Director of the UC Students 
Association Raymond Austin said.

Though Monday meant the begin-
ning of finals week for some University 
of California, California State University 
and California community colleges, it 
also saw many of those same college 
students protesting budget cuts, fee 
increases and a “decline in the quality” 
of higher education at a “study-in” — a 
sit-in, combined with studying for rap-
idly approaching final exams.

The event, hosted by Students 
for California’s Future — a coalition 
of members from the University of 
California Student Association, 
California State Student Association 
and Student Senate for the California 
Community Colleges — took place 
at the Capitol building in Sacramento 
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Over 100 students arrived between 
6 and 7 a.m. with blankets and books 
to begin the study-in before state legis-
lators arrived at the Capitol for the day, 
according to Vice President of External 
Affairs for UC Santa Cruz and UCSA 
undergraduate committee chair Hailey 
Snow.

“The protest was originally sup-
posed to begin as a sleepover Sunday 

night, but we didn’t really want to sleep 
on the cement all night,” Snow said. 
“So instead, we showed up as early as 
we could to make it seem as if we had 
been there all night.”

Protesters included representa-
tives from each of the college sys-
tems, including students from most 
UC campuses, with the exception of 
UCSD and UCSF, Snow said.

“The overall goal of the study-
in was to protest Gov.  Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s cuts to the UC sys-
tem, the CSU system and the com-
munity college system,” UCSA 
Executive Committee President Louise 
Hendrickson said.

Hendrickson, along with Lt. Gov. 
John Garamendi, California State 
Student Association President Dina 
Cervantes and others, spoke at a rally 
and press conference at noon.

Protesters received unexpected 
support at the midday rally when K-12 
students touring the Capitol for the day 
joined the event.

Modeled after the idea of a sit-in 
protest, the study-in method aimed 
to remind those witnessing the event 
that the protesters were being severely 
impacted by the budget cuts and fee 
increases, Snow said.

“We wore college gear and protested 
outside, instead of dressing in suits and 
going before the Legislature, to remind 
everyone that these are real people that 
are being affected — students with 
finals to study for and tuition bills to 

Demonstrators from 
colleges across the 
state visit Sacramento

against budget cuts.

A popular surf and skim location, La Jolla’s Windansea beach is packed with students and local residents most weekends. The beach gained national attention 
last year when five surfers who frequented the spot were accused of beating a professional surfer to death outside of a nearby bar. The five now face trial.

Wine May Prevent Liver 
Disease, Study Says

A recent study conducted by 
UCSD researchers concluded that 
modest wine consumption on a 
daily basis may not only be safe, 
but could potentially decrease the 
prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease.

Appearing in the June 2008 issue 
of the journal Hepatology, the study, 
which was conducted at the UCSD 
School of Medicine showed that 
those who reported consuming as 
much as one glass of wine per 
day, in comparison to consuming 
no alcohol, had a decreased risk 
of liver disease due to NAFLD by 
as much as 50 percent. Those who 
reported beer consumption of an 
equal amount were reportedly at 
four times the normal risk of devel-
oping liver disease due to NAFLD. 

“The results of this study present 
a paradigm shift, suggesting that 
modest wine consumption may not 
only be safe for the liver but may 
actually decrease the prevalence 
of NAFLD,” associate professor of 
gastroenterology, hepatology and 
nutrition at the School of Medicine 
Jeffrey Schwimmer said. 

The study involved a cross-sec-
tional, population-based survey of 
nearly 12,000 participants. Among 
those participating were 7,211 non-
drinkers and 4,543 modest alco-
hol drinkers, modest consumption 
being defined as an average of up 
to one drink per day of either four 
ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer 
or one ounce of liquor.

Researchers will continue to 
investigate the findings of the study 
in order to understand exactly what 

components of the wine help to 
decrease the risk of liver disease.

 

Med Center Performs New 
Weight Loss Procedure
Researchers at the UCSD Medical 

Center’s division for the treatment 
of obesity have developed a new 
incision-free procedure designed to 
prevent post-gastric bypass weight 
gain.

Every year more than 100,000 
people undergo gastric bypass sur-
gery to treat obesity. Doctors have  
noted that nearly 20 percent of those 
who undergo the procedure experi-
ence a regaining of weight within 
a few years of the surgery due to 
excessive stretching of the stomach. 

The medical center’s new proce-
dure, first performed in California on 
May 14, seeks to prevent this weight 
gain, which can lead to renewed risk 
within patients for such diseases as 
hypertension, diabetes and cardio-
vascular disease. 

The procedure, called “ROSE” 
(Restorative Obesity Surgery, 
Endolumenal), involves inserting 
surgical tools and a small, flexible 
endoscope into the patient’s mouth. 
These instruments are used to fold 
and stitch tissue to reduce the diam-
eter of the stomach opening and the 
volume of the stomach pouch.

“To date, procedures to revise 
gastric bypass surgeries have been 
expensive and difficult to perform, 
effectively leaving patients without 
any treatment options,” obesity 
treatment center director Santiago 
Horgan said in a statement. “Now, 
with this procedure, we have a dra-
matically less invasive way to correct 
a key cause of weight regain.”

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

worry about,” Snow said.
As finals approach, Hendrickson 

said the idea of a study-in was the most 
effective way to allow students to focus 
on their studies while also focusing on 
the protest.

“We decided to use a ‘study-in’ 
so that students could continue to be 
students and to study, and to not fall 
behind in their schoolwork,” she said. 

Throughout the day, students 
moved in groups of eight to 12 to dif-
ferent locations around the Capitol, 
sitting and studying in front of key 
legislators’ offices and making lobby 
visits, Snow said.

“We sat and studied with signs 
explaining what we were doing, and 
everyone who saw us stopped to speak 
with us about the protest,” she added. 

In a timely role reversal, another 
important part of the protest included 
the students grading legislators based 
on their voting records for higher edu-
cation funding.

Protesters held up a large report 
card during the rally showing the gov-
ernor’s grade: a D minus.

Demonstrators also displayed 
descriptions of each legislator’s voting 
record in the “blue books” that many 
students are required to use for exams.

“We told the legislators that we were 
putting them to the test,” Hendrickson 
said.

UCSD was unable to send rep-
resentatives to the study-in because 
there was a limited budget at the end 
of the year that could not accommo-
date sending students to Sacramento, 
according to A.S. Vice President of 
External Affairs and UCSA Board of 
Directors member Lisa Chen.

Heated, Sluggish Debate Powers Council 
Through Marathon Budget Meeting

C ouncilmembers settled into their seats in the Price Center Forum early yesterday eve-
ning to embark on an eight-hour mara-
thon meeting that tip-toed through 
every line of the proposed executive 
budget for next year.

Not long before midnight, the 
council was forced to change venues 
so that the forum could be cleaned 
up. The project of moving dozens of 
leery-eyed attendees from one room to 
another (a surprisingly perilous task at 
11:40 p.m.) was symbolic of the meet-
ing itself: The council labored through 
debate after debate during the meeting 
while making very 
few substantial 
changes.

Despite the 
looming need to 
address the budget, 
last night’s meet-
ing began as many 
others have with a 
special presentation from university 
representatives. The topic du jour was 
the impact of next month’s U.S. Open, 
which will take place in UCSD’s back-
yard just in time for finals.

Special Events and Protocol rep-
resentative Judy Lane was on hand to 
assuage student fears.

“We will be impacted, but will 
things just be disastrous and over-
whelming and uncontrollable? No,” 
she said. 

Lane also sought to dispel rumors 
that UCSD was paid off to allow the 
event to take place near campus, say-
ing that the university was given a 
“hospitality tent”  at the event to host 
guests of its choosing but nothing 
more.

The main attraction, however, was 
undoubtedly the proposed executive 
budget, which contained $1.7 million 
in student activity fee appropriations 
in seven grueling pages. President 

Donna Bean repeatedly stressed the 
financial constraints under which the 
budget was devised, foreshadowing 
early on that it would be very difficult 
to get councilmembers to agree on 
cutting funds from one event or orga-
nization to fund another.

John Muir College Senator Mabel 
Tsang was first to dust off a skeleton 
from the proverbial A.S. closet when 
she suggested using $10,500 from the 
budget meant for next year’s Sun God 
Festival to fund college festivals, which 
did not receive any funding in the pro-
posed budget.

The council has wrestled with 
the issue of using 
all-campus activ-
ity fees to fund 
col lege-specif ic 
events for years, 
and last night was 
no exception.

“College coun-
cils [can] get 

money … by running referenda,” said 
Sixth College Senator John Cressey, 
representing last night’s prevailing 
council opinion in the ongoing debate. 
“The mixing of funds is not what we 
want to be a part of. It looks like A.S. is 
controlling part of college councils.”

Tsang’s motion was defeated, 
as was almost every other motion. 
Although the council had an oppor-
tunity to explore the nuances of 
defining a “tradition event” and put-
ting a price on council retreats and 
“meet and greets,” the only substan-
tive action involving activity-fee dol-
lars was to reallocate $1,000 from 
A.S. Safe Ride in order to support the 
holiday airport shuttle at the end of 
Fall Quarter.

With that change, and a few oth-
ers, the council approved the budget 
in the time that it would take to walk 
to San Diego International Airport 
and back.

Still, Yanke’s attorney Kerry 
Steigarwalt said that the incident was 
an accident. 

“These five men were all friends 
with Mr. Kauanui,” Steigerwalt said. 
“There is no evidence of gang-related 
structure or rituals. Plus, the weapons 
found in these men’s homes, which 
include a few pocket knives, a BB gun 
and a potato launcher, are basically 
harmless.” 

Levikow still insists that the group’s 
collective actions constitute gang-
related activity. 

“They may not be on the street cor-
ner, selling drugs or pimping, but they 

are group of indi-
viduals that seek to 
commit crime and 
terrorize the com-
munity,” Levikow 
said. 

K a u a n u i ’ s 
death marked the 
first murder in  La 
Jolla in five years.

San Diego 
Police Department 
officer John 
Johnso said that 
fights such as this, 
as well as gang-
related activity, are 

virtually non-existent in La Jolla. 
“I personally don’t have any 

knowledge of any other surfer gang 
activity in La Jolla,” Johnson said. 
“There has been no history of a prob-
lem such as this in the past. Apart 
from the occasional brawl that can 
result from such a high gathering of 
people on the beach, the area is rela-
tively peaceful.”  

Local surfers paddled out at 
Windansea Beach last June in 
Kauanui’s memory. The ritual, which 
was one of the biggest that La Jolla has 
ever seen, is used by surfers to honor 
their dead.

four days later at Scripps Memorial 
Hospital. 

Defense lawyers, however, main-
tain that Kauanui squared-off first 
with House and then with Cravens, 
but was not touched after he was 
knocked to the ground.

Prosecutors are hoping to charge 
Kauanui’s alleged murderers as gang 
members, thereby allowing them 
to prosecute the defendants under 
stricter state laws that define a gang 
as a group of three or more people 
with a common name, identifying 
symbol and engage in crime activi-
ties.  

“These men 
are as much a 
gang as any frater-
nity,” said Craven’s 
lawyer, Mary Ellen 
Attridge. “This 
isn’t the Bloods 
and the Crips.”

Paul Levikow, 
a spokesman for 
the San Diego 
district attorney’s 
office disagrees. 

“The law 
doesn’t take into 
account socioeco-
nomic background,” Levikow said. “It 
looks at actions.” 

Prosecutors are asking Link to 
consider multiple gang-related factors 
involved in the incident, including the 
use of hand signs by members form-
ing the letter “B,” the spray-painting 
of the letters “BRB” on walls and side-
walks around the town and, shortly 
before Kauanui’s death, entries on 
MySpace by a user under the alias 
“Bird Rock Bandits” that said that 
this is going to be one “blood bath of 
a summer.” 

Acquaintances of the suspects 
told the police that Kauanui’s death 
was premeditated and that “they were 
going to jump him” because “they 
were trying to be a gang.”

high turnover and staffing shortages, 
over-reliance on temps and compro-
mised patient safety.

“For service staff at the campuses

THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2008THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2008

It is remarkably unbelievable to think that the UC Board of Regents has lacked a student-
concentrated board for so long — 
until now. Months ago, UC student 
Regent Benjamin Allen proposed a 
special committee to specialize in 
issues of student life. The advisory 
body will be the primary bridge 
between the elevated regents and 
the masses of students they govern.

Allen’s idea drew praise to the 
tune of unanimous regental approv-
al, an uplifting indication that 
UC executives possess at least a 
semblance of a vital understand-
ing: Students need to be heard. The 
committee would field issues of stu-
dent mental health, campus climate, 
initiatives funded by student fees, 
legislation that impacts student life 
and alumni engagement. 

The timing could not be more 
impeccable. UC mental health 
departments are decrying the 
amount of university support they 
receive. Campuses need better men-
tal health services that help students 
cope with the university’s top-flight 

academic environment. Meanwhile, 
politics are driving up tuition and 
fees, igniting a furious torrent from 
students. Also, budding UC cam-
puses like UCSD are grappling with 
how to connect to and grow from 
their evolving alumni bases. Allen’s 
committee needs to quickly address 
these issues, and at the very least 
bring them to regents’ attention 
to push for faster, more concrete 
action. 

Unfortunately, improvements 
to student life will have to trickle 
down from the committee. Tackling 
such weighty problems requires 
extensive deliberation, but the rec-
ognition of those problems and 
establishment of a communication 
line between students and admin-
istrators are the much-needed first 
steps. Without this committee, stu-
dents will be forced into less orga-
nized efforts that will inevitably be 
less efficient. 

An example occurred just a short 
time ago. Hoping to stave off anoth-
er disabling round of fee hikes, 
crowds of students (many of whom 

were members of the UC Student 
Association) filled the regents’ 
meeting room. The effort proved 
fruitless, as the regents approved 
the hikes unanimously. The crowd 
then disintegrated into a loud 
in-room rally that, again, accom-
plished nothing. Student advocacy 
groups like UCSA can’t match the 
authority wielded by regental com-

mittees; they can both put issues on 
the table and make sure they are 
attended to.

At long last, students have a UC-
sanctioned launchpad from which 
they can voice concerns and express 
protest. The university needs to use 
this committee as quickly as pos-
sible to pose the hardest questions 
possible — student life mandates it.

Not only are same-sex couples bad 
influences on children, they encour-
age and promote gay lifestyles that 
spit in the face of the religious tenets 
upon which this country was found-
ed. By equating homosexual unions 
with straight unions, we are essen-
tially telling children that it’s perfectly 
acceptable to be gay, not to mention 
destroying the entire institution of 
committed marriages and families.

Beware: Court Opens Pandora’s Box by Approving Gay MarriageBeware: Court Opens Pandora’s Box by Approving Gay MarriageBeware: Court
In a broadly worded decision that nullifies any law that discrimi-nates on the basis of sexual orien-
tation, the California Supreme Court 
struck down the state’s ban on same-
sex marriage last week, prompting 
extremely polarized reactions across 
the state: immediate cheering from 
supporters and a promise from oppo-
nents to fight the decision via a con-
stitutional amendment.

The 4-3 ruling declared that the 
state constitution guarantees a funda-
mental “right to marry” that applies 
equally to both straight and gay cou-
ples. Writing for the majority opin-
ion, Chief Justice Ronald M. George 
said any law that discriminates on 
grounds of sexual orientation be 
constitutionally suspect in the same 
manner as laws that discriminate 

a man and a woman is valid and rec-
ognized in California.”

The decision came after the high 

courts of New York, Washington 
state and New Jersey refused to grant 
gay couples the right to marry; only 

against ethnicity or gender, putting 
California at the forefront of the gay-
rights movement nationwide.

“Our state now recognizes that 
an individual’s capacity to establish 
a loving and long-term committed 
relationship with another person and 
responsibly to care for and raise chil-
dren does not depend upon the indi-
vidual’s sexual orientation,” George 
wrote. “An individual’s sexual orien-
tation — like a person’s race or gen-
der — does not constitute a legitimate 
basis upon which to deny or withhold 
legal rights.”

Citing a 60-year-old precedent 
that struck down a ban on inter-
racial marriage, the ruling voided 
Proposition 22, which was passed 
by 61 percent of voters in 2000 and 
declared that “only marriage between 

Massachusetts allows same-sex mar-
riage. 

Since the ruling, which takes 
effect in about 30 days, hundreds of 
gay couples statewide have declared 
plans to marry, including America’s 
most famous lesbian couple: come-
dian Ellen DeGeneres and actress 
Portia de Rossi. Both Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Los Angeles 
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, along 
with several other high-profile politi-
cians, have expressed approval over 
the ruling, hailing it as a great victory 
for civil rights in California. 

But not so fast. By relying on a 
screwball group of activist judges to 
push through a radical liberal agenda, 
California has embarrassed itself by 
brutally annihilating the traditional 
concept of family as society knows it. See WORD, page 5

“California has “California has “embarrassed itself by brutally annihilating the traditional concept 
of family as society 

knows it.”

This year’s revamped Sun God Festival brought program-ming expenditure to new 
heights. It offers the perfect time 
for evaluation as the A.S. Council 
reviews its 2008-09 budget. 

Councilmembers will have to 
consider the implications of fund-
ing this increasingly costly opera-
tion. The new format of the festival, 
with pricier security and operations, 
cost the council upwards of $30,000 
in mid-season funds. Programmers 
will undoubtedly and understand-
ably push for as much as pos-
sible; Assistant Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland court-
ed the A.S. Council several times 
throughout the year for continually 
larger amounts of festival funds.

Spoon-feeding Highland and 
his staff the exorbitant amount of 
money needed to fully support the 
festival would damage a diverse  
selection of programming. Consider 
healthy programming events such as 
bear gardens and college concerts, 
both of which draw sizable crowds, 
create community and deserve more 
financial attention.

But is more council funding really 
the best option for the festival? Is it 
even a reasonable solution, given all of 
the council’s other financial responsi-
bilities? Fiscally responsible council-

members, headed by Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Sarah Chang, 
have said that the council, along with 
the rest of the state, is financially 
scraping at the bone. Seeking support 
for the festival from the council would 
inevitably mean less funding for other 
student coffers.

The next logical step would be an 
A.S. fee referendum. For one, coun-
cilmembers have mentioned time 
and time again their troubles with 
funding restraints. Secondly, the 2008 
A.S. Council election ballot surveyed 
students to indicate their preferences 
for such a referendum — lo and 
behold, students tapped the Sun God 
Festival as their major interest. The 
two situations could be combined for 
a prime chance for students to claim 
greater control over the festival.

A fee referendum would be 
the perfect solution for Sun God 
funding, not because the festi-
val deserves more funding — or 
because students are the place to 
turn — but because a referendum 
would allow students to put their 
money where their mouths are, 
indicating exactly what they are 
willing to support. 

Complaints about this year’s fes-
tival are spouting from the wood-
work. Students have accused pro-
grammers of dismantling the tra-

ditional raucous festival ambiance, 
parading a weak lineup as first-rate, 
employing overzealous security and 
flubbing admissions procedures. 

The recent premiere of the new 
Sun God Festival has rallied the 
critics. If their protest rings loud-
ly enough, programmers should 
consider their complaints. A ref-
erendum would offer students at-
large the juicy opportunity to rain 
readjustments on their most loved 
event. It could be the most stu-
dent-involved process since droves 
turned out last year to voice their 
input about athletics. 

Props to the approaching end of the 
dogfight for the Democratic Party’s 
presidential nomination and inspiring win 
for Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).

Flops to A.S. councilmembers for 
threatening to swipe funding from the 

Koala on the basis that the newspaper 
publishes offensively radical material.

In Tight Budget Times, Trade 
Fest Funds for Sun God, Orgs

Dear Editor,

I just finished reading the article 
about the A.S Council’s debate on 
whether there should be a fee refer-
endum for student orgs and the Sun 
God Festival.

Personally, having voted for 
the fee increase for the athletics 
department and seeing how little of 
the increased fee has been used to 
attract students to sporting events, 
I cannot see how an activity fee 
increase would be to the benefit of 
the students here. College costs are 
already going up with the gover-
nor’s budget cuts.  

Increasing activity fees would 
be like adding salt to an open 
wound.  If the council wishes to 
truly benefit the students then they 
should discontinue the FallFest and 
WinterFest concerts.

Hardly anybody goes to them 
anyway and for the past few years 
they have failed to put on a concert 
that has truly stirred excitement 
and pride in the students. By cut-
ting those out of the budget, the 
money that is wasted on them can 
be spread to the Sun God Festival, 
student orgs and smaller student 
events that happen across campus 
nearly every day that tend to attract 
far more attention than FallFest 
and WinterFest. 

Fee increases are not the answer; 
drastic budget cuts, a better funded 
Sun God Festival and responsible 
fiscal spending on smaller student 
events are.

THURSDAY, HURSDAY, HURSDAY MAY 22, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Besides, how are children at school 
supposed to explain to their class-
mates why they have “two daddies”?

Moreover, by approving gay mar-
riage, the court has paved the way for 
a whole new meaning for the term 
“doggy style.” This logic has perhaps 
been best expressed by U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who 
wrote in his dissent after fellow jus-
tices struck down Texas’ antisodomy 
laws in 2003 that signing on to the 
“homosexual agenda” would leave the 
door open for bigamy, adult incest, 
prostitution, masturbation, adultery, 
fornication, bestiality and obscenity.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

Bestiality Next Step in ‘Homosexual Agenda’
▶ WORD, from page 4 In short, now that homosexu-

als are able to wed, what’s to stop 
California from legalizing sex with 
chimpanzees or approving polyga-
mous unions a la the Fundamentalist 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
Saints, which has a history of placing 
multiple underage girls into forced 
marriages with much older men?

To stop these radicals, voters should 
stand behind Advocates for Faith and 
Freedom, the Family Council and 
other religious organizations that are 
fighting to amend California’s consti-
tution to define marriage as it should 
be: between one man and one woman. 
Please, come November, make the 

right choice and vote to uphold fam-
ily values by overturning the Supreme 
Court’s decision.

Psych! If these arguments sound 
beyond ludicrous, that’s because they 
are. I just wanted to enlighten all of 
you with the bullshit that people are 
actually spewing to attack gay mar-
riage (bestiality, really?). We should be 
proud to live in a state where sexual 
orientation is no longer grounds for 
discrimination (27 other states have 
already amended their constitutions to 
ban gay marriage) and stand together 
to fight any attempts to repeal the 
court’s historic decision. Either that, or 
go fuck a duck.

THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  7

grumblings of a sentimental gamer
cenary Cloud — who I probably renamed 
Gay at the time, which made for some 
hilarious in-game conversations — and 
his band of revolutionaries (who I most 
likely named Caca, Peepee, Doodoo and 
Dogman) against the totalitarian Shinra 
Corporation. FFVII’s graphics don’t hold 
up at all today; the characters have balls 
for hands, clown feet and faces as detailed 
as me drawing three lines, but the story is 
what people remember so fondly. 

Sadly, that’s aged too, with Barret (a Mr. 
T racist stereotype with a gun-arm) and 
Cait Sith (a cat riding an animated stuffed 

animal) as perfect arguments for why vid-
eogames shouldn’t be taken seriously. 

To top it off, every few seconds the 
screen would flash and you’d be forced into 
a random battle against some fire-breath-
ing salamander knight when all you wanted 
to do was get on with the damn storyline. I 
had enough of a life to leave the three-disc, 
40-plus hour behemoth unfinished, but at 
least I played until Aeris died. I vowed to 
avenge her death by not playing anymore.

It seems that masochism and videogame 
adventures go hand in hand like hot curry 
and my mouth, and gamer nostalgia is best 
left in memory form. 

▶ CRITICAL, from page 6

Moralistic Hero Struggles to 
Meet Modern Expectations

Soviets to alien invaders with, of course, a 
twist. But once on screen, the whole look 
feels a little dry.

After all, it is strange seeing Indy in the 
1950s; even he admits it. 

The same dynamism is there, but now 
he’s a little older, a little heavier and a lot 
grayer. There’s a beautiful episode where he 
wanders into a dummy home in Nevada fea-
turing those now-tacky 1950s colors, where 
Howdy Doody sings on the brand new tele-
vision and our hero realizes it is about to be 
the site of an A-bomb test. 

His quick thinking makes for a cunning, 
albeit brief interlude, and when he finally 
emerges unscathed from the wreckage (it 
does hold together logically, don’t worry), 
Spielberg reveals a masterful shot of the 
adventurer dwarfed by the great mushroom 
cloud. 

Indiana Jones has entered a time period 
he’s not used to, where swords are brought 
to gun fights and push-button bombs are 

brought to wars. All he can do is make sure 
the atomic age has not made him obsolete.

Much of the goofy story can be blamed 
on Lucas, who has admitted he had a nuttier 
script for “Crystal Skull” and even nuttier 
ones in the pipeline. But Spielberg — whose 
finely honed camera keeps the story mov-
ing — and Ford, who’s a little stiff with his 
words but still quick with a punch, do their 
damnedest to right a capsized vessel. 

A big help is the solid but still clunky 
script by David Koepp, who keeps the film 
from turning into a self-referential love 
fest, finds every opportunity to pit Indy 
against various baddies and maintains the 
franchise’s staples from snakes to the travel-
ing map montages. 

Yet it still can’t escape the dogged confu-
sion surrounding Indiana Jones, the fam-
ily man. It shows in the quests: instead of 
fame, fortune and glory, the new piece de 
resistance is knowledge and education. So 
the moral of today’s story is: Stay in school, 
kids!

8  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2008

I n the last year or so, Flying Lotus has been praised as the second coming of Jesus in elite music circles. His abstract rhythms and deep, 
booming bass lines made him the poster child 
for the new generation of beat makers that has 
developed in FlyLo’s hometown of Los Angeles 
and across the pond in places like Scotland 
and Amsterdam. Lotus builds on his current 
momentum with Los Angeles, his full-length 
Warp Records debut. 

If his Reset EP was progressive, this album 
expands that innovation over the 45-minute 
LP to create a world of stuttered drums and 
surreal samples. The only other musicians on 
the album are vocalists who appear sparsely 
— tracks the Gonjasufi-assisted “Testament” 
and “Roberta Flack” (featuring Dolly) stand 
out. Still, the most endearing aspect of the 
album is how far Lotus strays from having a 
consistent style. From the opening, shoegazey 
“Brainfeeder” to the rocking “GNG BNG” and 
the house-ish “Parisian Goldfish,” Lotus rejects 
a standard form while still creating cohesive-
ness in his project. 

Chances are, Lotus is nothing like what 
you have heard before. There are elements of 

electronica, trance, house and other abstract 
genres in his music, but it is not just that. Lotus 
has managed to marry the low-end focus of 
instrumental hip-hop with abstraction and 
experimentation that allows him to create great 
music. The best part is that the record is only 
a sign of things to come, just like Lotus is just 
one individual out of an entire like-minded 
community, so keep your ears open.

W e Are Scientists exude irreverence and silly fun, traits instantly discernible from their whimsical band name and 
endearing brand of alternative rock that com-
bines the sweetness of Hello Goodbye with 
the energetic, faintly danceable rhythms of the 
Killers. Hailing from the fairly local enclave 
of Claremont, Calif. — strange, considering 
most of their success has come from the U.K. 
— We Are Scientists muses on fairly substan-
tive material that belies their goofy image. 

Brain Thrust Mastery is a worthy sequel to 
their critically acclaimed debut, boasting easily 
digestible melodies backed by lyrics that cohe-
sively form an extended musical conversation 
about managing relationship problems and 
disagreements. The lyrics capture just the right 
essence and combination of heartache, hope, 
fury and adoration that inevitably leads to 
conflict, resolution and love, all placed against 
a backdrop of infectious beats that seam-
lessly blend retro-pop and dance rock without 
underselling either camp.

“Ghouls,” the opening track, begins with 
the declaration that “We all recognize that 
I’m the problem here,” progressing through 

an exploration of common relationship woes 
and culminating with a proclamation that 
perfectly sums up the band’s blend of serious 
lyrics and kinetic rhythms: “Oh, let’s not argue 
about what’s right/ let’s just agree that it was 
fun, fun.” 

The album refrains from both the overt 
fluffiness of bubblegum pop and the shod-
dily executed productions of many dance-rock 
anthems in favor of reconciling both extremes 
with breezy tracks that are weightier than they 
initially seem. The guitar, lyrics, drums and 
synthesizer are synced perfectly, a sublime 
balance with no aspect of the music over-
whelming the rest. The slower tracks aren’t 
mellow enough to induce drowsiness, and the 
dance beats aren’t likely to inspire you to bust 
a move in Price Center Plaza when rocking to 
your iPod. Rather, the softer songs will foment 
relaxation and reflection, the faster tracks will 
get your head bobbing or your foot tapping, 
and both types will have you shamelessly 
submerged in the Scientists’ highly pleasing 
sound.

and go back into the garage, 
your prayers have been answered. 
The Hot Tubs are a not-so-secret 
side project from the American 
Idiots, similar to the electro-punk 
album the trio released under 
the Network moniker years ago. 
Tracks like “Mother Mary” take the 

cues that Jet stole from Iggy Pop 
and have a little more fun with 
copped retro kicks. Heavy jangler 
“The Pedestrian” even shows 
Green Day’s roots with Billie Joe 
Armstrong’s accented gravel and 
a forceful rhythm section. Come to

Lynn Hershman-Leeson offers 
an off-the-cuff stab at experimental 
documentary “Strange Culture,” 
detailing the shocking and tragic 
arrest of artist Steve Kurtz. The 
night of his wife’s death (portrayed 
in flashback by Oscar-winner 
Tilda Swinton), Kurtz finds himself 
accused of bioterrorism by the 
FBI on account of his offbeat and 
somewhat controversial artwork. 

What follows is a seamless hybrid of 
actor reenactments and interviews, 
chronicling Kurtz’s tragic tale 
— which included the government 
impounding of his work, house, 
even his wife’s body — and the 
subsequent trial alongside friend 
and collaborator Robert Ferrell. 
“Strange Culture” makes its San 
Diego debut tonight at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art. (CM)

finish line in a time of 8:04.2, just three 
seconds shy of the Vikings’ 8:01.1.

Urbanczyk was another Triton 
honored during the PCRC, collect-
ing two silver medals of her own for 
her stellar performances, first with the 
varsity four crew and then with her 
second place finish in the single event. 
Two additional boats, the novice four 
and the lightweight four, also came in 
with elite finishes as they took first and 
second place, respectively. 

The Tritons are scheduled to leave on 
May 30 for the Rowing Championships 
and are eager for their next chance to 
face Western Washington. 

“It was amazing how our boat really 
pulled together for that race,” Hayashi 
said regarding Saturday’s regatta. “It’s 
even more exciting next week — know-

ing that we only had three seconds 
— because the next time we meet, we 
are going to take them down.”

According to Pinkerton, the success 
as head coach in leading the Tritons to 
the NCAA Rowing Championships is 
something she finds unique to UCSD.

“It is a reflection of the athletic com-
munity here at UCSD,” she said. “We 
recruit college students that have never 
rowed before, but the girls on this team 
were attracted to the fact they could join 
and contribute to the dream of winning 
a national title. That says a lot about the 
type of student that goes here.”

Pinkerton also said that rowing is 
the type of sport that rewards hard 
work and determination, and the 
team hopes to add another banner. 
Resonating Pinkerton’s ambitions, 
Myers expressed the team’s optimism 

and confidence.
“We’ve done the work now and it’s 

just a matter of focusing and coming 
together,” Myers said. “It was our goal 
this year to win the national champion-
ship and we’re going to go after that.”

Hayashi echoed her teammate and 
knows that the Tritons have the poten-
tial to win it all.

“Our goal is to take the gold, and 
I really believe our crew team this 
year can do that,” Hayashi said. “We’re 
so close it’s unbelievable. It’s such an 
honor to be with these girls who are 
amazingly talented and powerful ath-
letes. We are really excited and deter-
mined to give everything we have into 
this next race.”

Gold Medal Within Sights at National Regatta
▶ CREW, from page 12

sophomore starter Matt Ross0man 
cruised through the middle innings, 
holding the Lopers scoreless from the 
second through the eighth innings 
before giving up three runs in the bot-
tom of the ninth. At that point, UCSD 
was ahead 12-2, so O’Brien allowed 
Rossman to complete his start and he 
finished with a line of nine innings 
pitched, five runs allowed on eight hits 
and a walk, and nine strikeouts.

“I was going into that start knowing 
that I needed to keep my pitch count 
down and get deep into that ballgame 
and hopefully finish it in order to give 
our team any chance to be competitive 
in that second game,” Rossman said.

O’Brien praised his starter for help-
ing the team in a crucial game.

“That was his ballgame and he was 
going to finish it,” O’Brien said. “He 
knew what his job was that day; it wasn’t 
just to give us a quality start, it was to get 
us to that night game with a fresh bull-
pen and he did exactly that. Players find 

ways to step up in big situations and 
that’s what Matt did on Saturday.”

With their second win in the West 
Regional, the Tritons advanced to the 
semifinal round to play Chico State 
once again and the Wildcats increased 
their win streak against UCSD to three 
games with a 3-2 victory that ended 
UCSD’s record-setting season.

Junior starter Trevor Decker did 
an amazing job on the mound against 
a tough Chico State offense, going 5.2 
scoreless innings and leaving the game 
with a slim lead after UCSD put up two 
runs in the top of the fifth to go up 2-0. 
Shibuya relieved Decker and did not 
fare as well, allowing three runs in 1.1 
innings, only one of which was earned. 
Again, shoddy defense cost the Tritons 
a crucial win, as five errors in the game 
led to two unearned runs.

For one of the best defensive teams 
in the nation, ending the season on that 
note frustrated O’Brien and his players.

“[The errors] are still tough to get 
over,” O’Brien said. “We work so hard 

defensively and our guys made plays 
in the clutch throughout the year. But 
the bottom line is if you want to be a 
championship club, you have to pitch 
and you have to play defense. And we 
got some great outings on the mound, 
we just didn’t make plays behind the 
guys, and that ended up costing us a 
trip to the College World Series.”

Despite the frustration with their 
elimination from a possible first-ever 
berth to the Division II College World 
Series, the Tritons can still be proud of 
a record-breaking season.

“Our annual goal as a program is to 
continue to improve every single year in 
every aspect of the program and I feel 
like we did that yet again,” O’Brien said. 
“I’m very proud of this team and where 
they took this program. It’s a little bit of 
a bittersweet feeling but that bitterness 
is going to make us hungry to get to the 
College World Series next year.”

BASEBALL — After losing to confer-
ence rival Chico State in their first-
round game of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament, the 
No. 11 Tritons faced the Wildcats 
twice more in the NCAA Division II 
Championship West Regional and lost 
both games, which ended their season 
with a school-record 43 wins after win-
ning two games in the tournament.

The Tritons earned a bid to 
Regionals despite dropping their first 
two games of the conference tourna-
ment, eliminating them from a chance 
at the CCAA crown. UCSD’s impressive 
regular season earned a No. 2 seed from 
the selection comittee and placed the 
team in a first-round matchup against 
No. 25 Western Oregon on May 15.

Down 3-2 to the Wolves, UCSD ral-
lied to take a lead off of junior second 
baseman Garrett Imeson’s three-run 
homer in the seventh inning. Imeson’s 
blast came on an 0-2 pitch and hit the 
top of the leftfield wall before bouncing 
over to give the Tritons the lead.

“Garrett’s been clutch for us all year 
and for him to come through in our 
first Regional game this year was fit-
ting,” head coach Dan O’Brien said.

Imeson’s blast kept sophomore 
starter Kirby St. John from picking up 
the loss after he allowed all three of the 
Wolves’ runs in 6.1 innings. Freshman 
Tim Shibuya relieved St. John and 
threw 1.2 scoreless innings to pick up 
the win and improve to 8-1 on the year 
and senior closer Keith Noe worked a 

perfect ninth, including two strikeouts, 
to tack on another save, his 14th, to his 
single-season school record.

“I can’t say enough about [Shibuya 
and Noe],” O’Brien said. “They are the 
reason why we’re a regional team.”

The opening-round win sent UCSD 
on to face Chico State on May 16, 
the second of three games the Tritons 
played against the Wildcats in just over 
a week. The tournament hosts got on 
the board first with a run in the open-
ing inning, but UCSD took the lead 
with two runs in the bottom of the 
third. The lead did not last, however, 
as the Wildcats exploded for six runs 
in the fifth, thanks in large part to two 
Triton errors, and never looked back.

UCSD scored twice in the bottom 
of the sixth to cut the Wildcat lead to 
7-4, but Chico responded with another 
three runs in the top of the seventh after 
an error. Chico State put up another 
three runs in the eighth to put the game 
out of reach, making UCSD’s three-run 
rally in the bottom of the ninth useless. 
The Tritons made a total of four errors 
in the game, leading to five unearned 
runs that could have been the differ-
ence between a win and a loss. 

With their first loss of the West 
Regional, the Tritons were forced to 
play in an elimination game against 
the University of Nebraska-Kearney on 
May 17. UCSD opened up the scoring 
with four runs in the top of the first and 
the Lopers came right back with two 
runs of their own in the bottom half. 

After struggling in the first inning,

WOMEN’S CREW — The Tritons’ var-
sity eight and four boats both took sec-
ond place at the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif. on May 17. UCSD’s results were 
earned the team a returning trip to the 
Division-II National Championships 
from May 30 to June 1.

For the Tritons, this year marks their 
fourth consecutive NCAA postseason 
appearance and the third-straight team 
bid for the women’s crew. The commit-
tee’s decision reached the Tritons May 
20 as the team huddled around head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton’s office in antici-
pation. After learning of the celebratory 
news, Pinkerton credited her rowers’ 
dedication for their level of success. 

“In some ways it was a relief because 
you never know what’s going to happen 
in a committee,” she said. “But it really 
was a vindication of all the hard work 
the girls have done because they made 
a commitment in the beginning of the 
year. And they’re pretty excited their 
hard work has paid off.”

The greatest manifestation of that 
hard work came during Saturday’s 
regatta when both the varsity eight and 
four boats surged into second place 
directly behind Western Washington 
University, the country’s top ranked 
team. Spurting to the finish line with 
a time of 7:04.1, the varsity eight crew 
entered 11 seconds behind Western 
Washington but topped Seattle Pacific’s 
finish by a sturdy five seconds (7:09.3). 
The Triton lineup included junior cox-
swain Stephanie Chang, senior Kelsey 
Thomas (stroke), senior cocaptain 
Jen Myers (seven-seat), senior cocap-
tain Kali Webb (six), junior Alissa 
Kispersky (five), freshman Denise 
Kleckner (four), junior Jill Peacock 
(three), senior Maureen Kantner (two) 
and senior Kim Shaffer (bow).

According to Myers, her squad’s 
solid performance was a reflection of 
their ongoing and diligent training.

“It was a matter of the team com-
ing together and putting to work what 
we had been working on all week,” she 
said. “We had been doing a lot of speed 
work in preparation for this event and 
it was truly a great feeling to see your 
work come to fruition.” 

Myers, a senior from Mammoth 
Lakes, Calif. who was recently named 
to the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association’s All-WIRA First Team, is 
no stranger to outstanding athleticism 
as she took home three medals on 
Saturday — gold, silver and bronze 
— when the Tritons took first in the 
open eight event and also when she 
placed third in the collegiate single 
competition. Myers credits the team’s 
unity and ability to work cohesively 
as it battles against rivals like Seattle 
Pacific University and Humboldt State.

“This is such a team sport,” Myers 
said. “Any accomplishments that I’ve 
had are a result of our team’s work and 
their support.”

The varsity four unit of freshman 
coxswain Leslie Nanninga, junior 
Caryn Urbanczyk (stroke), freshman 
Kristen Hayashi (three-seat), junior 
Lauren Menzies (two-seat) and junior 
Kelly Hansen (bow) engaged in a fierce 
pursuit of first place against power-
house Western Washington. Their val-
iant effort brought them across the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — In 
her first full off-season with the 
Tritons, head coach Charity Elliott 
has been busy adding new players 
and getting ready for the 2008-09 
season. After recruiting three new 
freshmen to the team in the early 
signing period, Elliott signed five 
more players to UCSD’s team and 
adds that she may not be done yet.

“We have the eight new players 
coming in and there is a potential 
for us to get one more,” she said. 
“But, it’s too early to say yet.”

For now, Elliott is excited about 
the five new players that she did 
sign. Lauren Freidenberg, Anna 
Corinne Platten, Jenelle Conklin, 
Kristen Cabral and Leilani Martin 
will be joining UCSD women’s bas-
ketball when the season starts this 
fall. The Tritons have already had a 
first look at the new players and are 
excited about their potential.

“We had a weekend with the new 
girls and saw a few of them play,” 
junior forward Michelle Osier said. 
“I’m excited because the returning 
girls and the new girls look solid.”

With Freidenberg, UCSD obtains 
an inside threat as the 6-foot-tall 
power forward who averaged 15.4 
rebounds per game and 4.5 blocks 
per game in her senior year of high 
school.

“Lauren brings great athleticism, 
tremendous rebounding ability and 
she’s left handed,” Elliott said.

With senior center Alexis Gaskin 
returning for her final year of eligi-
bility, the Tritons already have a 
strong force in the post for the 
upcoming season. 

“Gaskin returning for another 
year is huge for our team,” Osier 
said. “She had a successful season 
last year but that doesn’t even begin 
to describe her potential … She is 
by far the strongest player on the 
team and in the league. No one can 

match up to her when it comes to 
strength.”

Among the new additions, 
Platten and Martin bring the most 
versatility as each can play mul-
tiple positions on the court. Platten 
comes to UCSD after playing in 
Sweden and Martin is a transfer 
from Foothill College. Both players 
can be placed in the lineup at either 
guard or forward. 

“Anna is a tall combo guard, 6 
foot 2 inches, who can play the one, 
two, three or four positions,” Elliott 
said. “She brings a European style 
of play — a finesse style with a great 
offensive mentality. Leilani can play 
the one or two or three position and 
brings experience to the backcourt. 
She is a bigger point guard who 
can also play the shooting guard or 
small forward.”

The Tritons lost six seniors at the 
end of the 2008-09 season including 
top scorer senior forward Meaghan 
Noud. The addition of Conklin, 
a pure shooter, should help the 
Tritons offensively. Conklin also 
shoots the three-ball pretty well, 
shooting around 42 percent from 
behind the arc during her seasons at 
Ventura Community College. 

“Jenelle is a shooting guard and 
small forward that brings a scoring 
mentality for the backcourt,” Elliott 
said.

The addition of Cabral to the 
team gives strength to both sides 
of the court. A solid offensive and 
defensive player, Cabral comes 
from Fullerton Community College 
where she averaged 11.1 points and 
6.5 rebounds per game last season. 

“Kristen is a power forward that 
brings experience to the team,” 
Elliott said. “She is a solid post 
defender and scorer and will fit in 
well with our transition game.”

Because it is still early in the 
offseason, some of these new play-
ers may have a chance to impact the 
team as soon as next season begins. 
With the Tritons losing starters 

Noud and senior point guard Alexis 
Mezzetta, UCSD has some holes 
to fill.

“It’s hard to determine from our 
incoming group who is going to be 
ready right away,” Elliott said. “So 
much depends on their ability to 
understand and buy into the sys-

tem. But, certainly with Michelle 
Osier returning and Alexis Gaskin 
deciding to stay for her last year 
of eligibility, next year should be 
pretty exciting.”
