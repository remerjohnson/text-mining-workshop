Letters to the Editor 

Questions regarding 
Reggie Williams 
Editor: 

I have a few questions 
regarding some articles and 
letters, printed in the 
Guardian last fall , about 
Reggie Williams ' alleged 
"fraudulent" and "illegal" 
actions. The original article 
(which was accompanied by a 
mournful editorial and a 
cartoon depicting Williams 
leaning up against a bust of 
Karl Marx while simultane-
ously pickpocketing the AS) 
accused Williams of illegally 
extracting a large amount of 
fund s from AS Student 
Organization monies, 

Responding defensively to a 
following Letter-to-the·Editor, 
which criticized the original 
article, the Guardian stated 
that (with some definitions 
help from the Student Legal 
Services) the u!Se of the term 
"fraud" was appropriate in 
this case. Yet several weeks 
later, in describing the action!S 
of a weekly AS Council 
meeting, the Guardian 
reported the results of an AS 
"Reggie Williams Ime!Stiga-
tion Committee ." The 
committee found there was no 
fraud Involved, but that 
Williams had received money 
under a contractuaL agreement 
with the uOlversity. Williams 
wa~, In fact, an employee of 
thiS unl\!er~ity. 

So, mj que~ti(Jns are the~e: 
1) By what pos~ible 
rea~Ontng (legal or ()therwi~e) 
are tht' term" "fraud" and 
"i llegal" appropnate here If 

Wdliam~ \\.'as an empl()~'ee of 
the uni\er"ity? 

2) Why was there noattempt 
to contact William" before the 
original article wa ... pnnted? 
Does he not de~erve, atlea"t, a 
'no comment ?" And how coml' 

nobody at tht' New Indicator 
Collect Ive wa~ contacted (( 
assume WilIlams doe" not 
print the IIi all by hlmself)? 

3) At the tlmt the onginal 
article wa~ printed, Wtlllam~ 

wa~ creating a bll of an uproar 
(i.e. "Freeze Reggie Wllham~") 
with hi" Clrculat ing a pet Ilion 
to expand the AS Council by 25 
members. Ho\\ dId the 
Guardian get the onglnal 
information on Williams? I 
gather that the Guardian did 
not , sudden ly out of the blue, 
start investigating WilIiams. I 
suspect the information was 
supplied by someone else, and 
only then did the Guardian do 
some investigating of its own. 
If this IS so, what were the 
motivations of that per~on 
"breaking the story" to the 
Guardian? 

4) Later s tilI , in another 
Letter·to-the-Editor, a member 
of the AS Council denounced 
the original art icle, demand 109 
a retractIOn and an apology to 

Williams. Yet there was no 
retraction, no apology, no 
explanation, no reply. Why? 

[ would appreciate it if you 
would not only just print this 
letter, but also respond to the 
above Questions.

Suicide: compassion vs. reality 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to 
your article which appeared in 
the January 20 issue of The 
Guardian, " It Was a Very Bad 
Year ... 1 Guess." 

At first [ found myself 
angered, incensed and 
infuriated by your insensit ive, 
crass remarks. As I read on, I 
perceived that you were, 
perhaps, attempting to 
express something more 

So Inaybe 
the Bird 
isn't up 
By ROBERT "It won't happen 

again" LEONE 
Yes, Indeed, lad les a nd 

gentlemen and others, yours 
truly has committed a 
journalistIC sin. He left out of 
his article in the la ... t 
Guardia II , "The Bird, the 
Legend, to be Erected Today," 
the simple note t hat If it 
rained. the event would be 
cancelled . 

I knew it, half my 
informants knew it. 

Vladmir Pshashkov even 
sent me a nice let ter telling me 
about the Impending gale (It 
was Friday when I got the 
translation, ho\\,evpn, heck, 
everylxxly except the NatIOnal 
Public Radio knew It, and NPR 
told me about the blo(xl\ rain. 

On Tut'sday. . 
It's not a case of "Ah, well, 

it 's at the printcr~, I can't 
change it no\\'." It .... a case of 
"I{ain, Rain, go away, come 
again some other day." 

So, t he bird did not go up on 
this campus last Thur"dav, 
and a lot of sl udell! s were 
misled. 

The answer to the que"t ion 
"When will it go up)" is rather 
complex. According to one of 
the guys that works in the 
Stuart Collect ion.... office a t 
the top of Mandeville. the bird 
shou ld beput upanYlimethey 
get advance noti ce of a 24·hour 
dry spel l on a weekday. 
Tuesday is supposed to b the 
target day, but if it rain s, or 
even threatens to rain , then 
the date of emplacement will 
be moved to Wednesday, 
possibl y Thursda y, or more 
likely Friday. If the last day is 
correct, then the A.S. can 
arrange a T .C.LLI., or "Thank 
God It's LI p." 

Sources for this article arc 
hard to believe. There are two 
meanings to the last sentenn'. 
Roth arc an·urate. 

profound. Namely: 
1 )to clarify the horror and 

heinous aspects of suicide; 
2) to remind the UCSD 

community of the presence of 
suicide deaths, and our own 
mortalit y; 

3) to ventilate some of your 
own personal fru ... tration s, 
anxieties and c;adneo.;s in 
regards to the deaths you 
mentioned 

This is all well and good, and 
J do not question your ability 
or right to freely express such 
thought s. Howe\er. I do 
quest ion the way in which you 
achieved this. 

I did not read your art Ide 
merel y on a 'u rface level. If I 
did , I would never comprehend 
the s uperficiall y callous 
manner of your writing. I do, 
however, feel that there could 
have been another way to get 
across your me'isage without 
turning Amy', and the other 
young man's death into a 
monstorous travesty . You 
have made a scathing farce of 
these people's lives and 
deaths. If Amy had been my 
sister, or the young man my 
son, it wou ld wrench my heart 
to read an article displaying 
their deaths In such a 
blatantly hideous and brutal 

way. 
Yes, c; uiclde is a reality, and 

yes, young people die. Bu t I am 
curious about a few things -
Scott Young - have you ever 
had your life completely 
altered and your being shaken 
by the deat h of !Someone close 
in vour life? Did you write a 
worthwhile piece' of journa-
lism that \\as a true testament 
to the dignity of life and the 
tragic loss \ve sense when a 
pen,on dies/commits su icide? 
You should ask yourself if the 
honesty you express in your 
article \\a!> achieved at the 
expense of the memories of 
tho:-.e who died and the 
feeling~ of tho!>e who knew 
and loved them. 

I feel your intent was 
ba"lcally good - but the 
means which vou used to 
attain your end are quite 
quest IOnable. 

Your moti\ atlOn should 
clearly have been love , 

compa~SlOn and under -
~tand11lg - not attention 
getting, farCical antics.

Write to legislature about high fees Foreign students worth

As students, you are all 
victims of Governor Oeuk· 
mejian's budget cut. Out of the 
$72 million cut from 
governmental agencies, $42 
million is being absorbed by 
the University of California 
and Cal State systems, This 
means tha t 601111 of t he deficit is 
bei ng funded by the st udents 
of higher education. In the 
State of California. higher 
pu blic education has always 

been accessible to all. Is this 
going to be changed now? 

As st udents and as voters 
you can apply political 
pressure to fight against 
student fee increases. Write 
your legislature now. Let them 
know how you feel about fcc 
increases and your inability to 
pay them. Furthermure, 
sugges t that the only way to 
balance the budget is with a 
lot tcry or a tax increase such 
as an oil severance tax, a

.\gam>.;." Tom and his fnl'llcb 
wrote \\hat I consider to be a 
slanted and unjust letter 
attacking last week\ Mlllr 
College Trivia Bowl. 

First, the B·house team 
accused the entire program· 
ming commi tt ee of being 
"completely ignorant" of how 
to conduct a trivia contest. As 
chairman of the Muir 
Program m ing com m iUee, I 
resent someone who is not 
even on the board, who put no 
effort into it at all, criticizing 
an effiCIent learn of people who 
worked hard to get the conte~t 
together. TlIll, if ~'(JU think you 
can clo better in the future. my 
committee meets e\er\ 
:Vlonday at 9:00 pm in theMu(r 
apartment lounge.

For B·house not to include that 
information in their article 
was a gross injust ice. 

Tom 's main criticism was 
that the Questions were too 
easv and "horrific." I think 
that. the B·house team should 
have gone to the Wednesday 
and Thursday night play·offs 
before they wrote their letter.

perhaps t hey would not have

question was taken randomlj 
from I he IIper Tril,ia 
ElI(vc/upedia . Since the name 
of t hat book was available to 
anyone who cared to ask, 
Tom's leam could have paged 
through it to determine what 
kind of questions were to be 
asked. For these reasons I feel 
that B-houses's accusations in 
this area are unfounded. 

All I have to say to Tom's 
complaint about "subjecti ng 
them..,eh·e:-. to this shameful 
excuse for 'a trivia.., contest" 
and dressing up for no reason, 
is thaI co:-.tumes were neither

On Tuesday. Jan 25th, the 

fir s t Academic Senate meeting

business of the day was 
passing two proposals . one. 
recommendation that lJCSIJ 
establish a law school by 
acq uiring Cal Western School 
of Law and the other. a 
mel110rtal to the I{ egents 
callin\! for IIlcrea:-;ed monitor-
ing of the UniverSIty of

The law sch(Jol recommend · 
ation passed after I he Act Hoc 
Committee on the chool of 
Law, comprised of faculty 
mem bero.;. made a report to the 
Academic Senate endorsing 
the Cal We'i tern merger with 
UCSD. 

The commillee members 
concluded that. "The addition 
of a school of la\\ to our 
ca mpu s will provide an 
invaluable resource for both 
s tudents and facult y ... ," and it 
will facilitate interchange 
between scientists a nd 
lawyers. "

chairs washed to ~ea, Wilterman explained that, 
"We're not going to sandbag and put up plywood. 
but instead we're going to let the water rush in and 
out." 

John Callahan. director of real estate for the Chart 
House explained that their biggest concern was that 
the foundation not be eroded. Callahan stated. 
"We're bringing in gunite ( a heavy cement 
mixture), and we're going to lay it all along the base 
of the restaurant in an effort to stop further 
erosion." 

The Triton, located next door. also sustained 
severe damages. The main dining room was gone, a 
100 pound rock crashed through the stained glass 
windows, and the carpets were de troyed. Steve 
McEllyea stated that, "We thought we would 
weather the storm. Nothing we cou ld have done 
would have prevented this." 

However. unlike the Chart House, the Triton was 
bracing for Friday, the morning- when the highest 
tide of the year would hit San Diego. 

They built walls of JA inch plywood, an outer wall 
of sand bags, and a second wall of sandbags in front 
of the kitchen. 

McEllyea spoke positively of the community's 
response to the disaster. sta ting t hat. "The neatest 
thing is that we have about 45 employees that a ll 
came down and volunteered their help. We've even 
h3d ~ome of our regular customers coming do" n to 
pitch in .... lt·s really been touch1l1g." 

One explanation giYen for the weekend storm's 
magniiuck was that its cause was clue to a 
comblllatlOn of three factors ' the full moon: the 
\\ in! ('I storm : and the highest tide of t he yea r, wh lC h 
occurs on Fnday, Jan 28 thiS year. 

Standing un the second floor of an apartment 
building at :36th and Oceanfront in l\lission Beach. 
"ome 14 feetaho\'e the patio, spectators saw the 
boardwalk fill \\Ilh water. 

At R::)O am the W;1\ es were crashing into the 
board\\alk's retaining wall Some occasiona ll y 
jumped the wall and drenched many who had 
arri\'ed to watch the wa\'es. 

The biggest wa\e of the morning hit at 9:44 am. It 
was actually two waves that had combi ned . The 
first swelled to the top of the wall, and when the 
second one fell into it, the wall of water came across 
the boardwalk and smashed down so hard that it 
knocked out the bottom floor's s liding glass doors. 
and splashed up ant 0 the balcom' and the windows 
behind it. -

What is the existing mass 
transit.' 

"The existing trolley, as far 
as the light rail mass transit 
goes. I did a lot of study on it. 
and had a lot of people yelling 
at me when I did it. But I found 
eleven good reasons to go for it 
and no good reasons to go 
against it. 

"It (South Bay Trolley) is 
really our third choice, the 
existing transit. The second 
choice is out to the ea t, and I 
fully support that. The reason 
we had to go toourthird choice 
first is because it was t he most 
feasable . Wecou ld do it for 585 
million. 

"To go to the north, which 
was the first choice, would 
h a "e cost more 1 i ke fi \'e

going to the south, we arc

Ruiz was greatly influenl ial 

in brIngIng Gutierrez to

leaching at Pomona College 
last year. and strongly 
recommended he be hired at 
lJCSD . "I wanted to get into a 
public institution with better 
resources. It's also closer to 
Ihe border." Gutierrez added.

A Ta%r now 

By CANOLE 

What is the Tao? 

[s t he Tao just another human belief or theory 
trying to explain the meaning of life? 

Turn to a Chinese dictionary and you wIll fInd, 
For Tao, refer to the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu." 

Turn to the Tao Te Ching and you will find. 
"the name and words about Tao are not Tao." 

If the Tao is not a philosoph y of words. 
then what was the intent of Lao Tzu' s writ ings? 

Was it to use words to point to a wisdom, 
which was not born from human concepts? 

If so. what was the source that inspired,l.ao Tzu. 
and is this source a\'ailable to us now? 

Lao Tzu ex pressed these feelings 
in a nature inspired philosophy. 

"[I flows rivers to the sea , effortlessly, 
circular i ' its motion, a unity of opposites. 

"From it, onene s is born , begetting light and dark , 
from light and dark all things are born. 

"[ts name is unknown, 
we shall call it the Tao." 

If you put aside your cultural ideas about life 
and walk into nature as Lao Tzu did , 

You will become aware of wordless feelings. 
reflecting a sen e of unity and harmony in 

na lure. 

Many have tried 10 translate and understand 
thi s philo-ophy of Lao Tzu. 

Translators have concentrated only on the book , 
and the interplay of Chinese and English words. 

Those who wa nted to under. tand this philosophy 
returned to Lao Tzu's source of wisdom. 

Now in our time of human complexity and conflict. 
we need to walk into nature again. 

If we sit calmly from dawn to dusk to dawn. 
we will rediscover this essence of life. 

Lao Tzu called it the Tao. 
we shall call it the way of th e Oay. 

What is Ihe Day? 

T he day is 
one rotation of the earth. 

It is a lways in motion 
without beginning or end. 

It is the essence of 
effort less act ion . 

It is the most consistent 
and most chan!,ring of events. 

It is a balance of opposites, 
ligh t becoming dark becoming light. 

It is the unbiased guide and provider 
to a ll th ings on earth . 

II is the example and inspiration 
to living a CIrcular way of lif('. 

Wl' have forgotten 
the \\ay of the Day. 

We live on narrow hnes 
of honzonlal and verlical. 

On ollr horizontal lint's.

The way 

What is the It'Oy of the Day? 
The way of the Day is 

to live on a circle. 
It is to see birth and death 

a two P0111ts we often pass. 
It is to flow as water does, 

yielding and overcoming all difficulties. 
It is to always be yourself. 

and also to be adapti\e to all situatIOns. 
It IS to become whole again. 

by balancing your actl\e and receptIve natures. 
It is to feel joy in the doing of tash. 

thus not needing praise or reward. 
It is to look to chi ldren as our examples 

of unbIased experiencing and learning. 

We may look within ourselves 
to contemplate the way of the Day. 

We may look out ide. to nature . 
to experIence the way of the Day. 

These two ways are both referred to 
as reflective activities. 

Thus they shal l be known as 
"reflectors" of the Day. 

How can Wl' understand the Day? 
The Da y. experience it we may, 

describe it we cannot. 
Word s we use to name things. 

they are not that which IS real 
We use words to draw mental maps. 

the world you must explore yourself. 
Let images of nature guide you. 

not words. 
Before our lime began 

there were no words .. 
There were no "things." 

we were one with all. 
Names are what gave birth 

to the millions of separate things. 
Lost in this separation of "us" and "things." 

we are now just one of many . 
By trying to define the Da). 

you will know oi "thIng·ness." 
The Day revealing il self 

as separate things around us. 
By living and flowing with Ihe Day 

you \ .... ill know the unily of " no·thingness." 
That infinIte energy flow. 

surrounding and bindll1g us . 
Feel the f10\\, 

feel the movement of the Day. 
Between you and me. 

bet ween t his rock and that tree. 
Thi ngness and nothingness are just two names. 

but from one source they are born. 

Look upon the calm lake. 
and you wIll see thiS oneness . 

The lake as ItS own "Iakencss." 
and also it is a "reflector" of I he Da) .

All books are naughty books

was talking about, for I have 
circumstantial evidence that 
books propagate, and they are 
causing a population explosion 
in my room. 

The ones on the helves are 
not the worst problem. When 
they reproduce they only fill 
up thei r space more tightly. 
Sometimes, it is true, it 
becomes impossible to remove 
them from theirdomiciles(and 
certainly to get any new one 
in). Then [ shall have to avoid 
history or economics or 
murder mystery for a while, 
unt il with a cloud of du t and a 
ound of shifting the 

population readjusts itself by 
disintegrating Agatha 
Christie or Maynard Keynes. 
Occasionally a collection of 
poetry or a novel will try a leap 
to safety, but it usually ends 
up being buried under a rubble 
of disused typewriter 
cartridges and yellowing 
copies of the Guardian. 

The bigger problem consists 
not of these, but of the 
homeless books. Here fifty 
Bohem ian volu mes cause more 
trouble than three hundred 
regimented ones . A small pile 
of decrepit Edwardian 
children's books has slowly 
grown higher and higher, and 
now I am just ' lightly unea y 
about investigating what it 
contains. Another pile of 
books, ones I am going to 
unload on , orne relatives, has 
gotten horter , its content 
creeping from their places 
across my desk. 

When my back is turned 
they are in 'a constant state of 
movement. Elements of Style 
sprawls drunkenly against an 
Oxford dictionary . A group of 
eighteenth century novel s 
have pushed off their resting 
place Dortor Faustlls and a 
recently purchased George 
Meredith novel. (Does anyone 
read George Meredith 
anymore? I don 't. ) In fierce 
competition for supremacy one 
Oxford has made its way to the 
top of its pile (but - for a 
pamphlet on the Canadian 

Houses of Parliament. a David 
among Goliaths), another has 
been left dry by the tide on a 
package of EZ-rase paper. 
Webster's ha crept past all 
the thesauri, balanced on the 
edge of its helL 

This i not to say the e 
books are disorganized. The 
ones in the bookcase are 
categorized by subject, author, 
or title; the ones on the tables, 
floor, bureau and chair (or bed, 
depending on whether I'm 
writ ing or sleeping) go by 
chronolugy. The only time I 
cannot find a book is when it 
gets in the wrong stratum. 
Once I could not find my 
favorite history book for a 
quarter. When ( went at the 
pile on my desk over the 
summer r found it had 
unaccountably sifted from 
'january through March' 
down to ·November.' 

This should not be taken as 
extraordinary anarchy on my 
part. [ know someone who lost 
his typewriter, unt il he began 
collecting his poetry for 
publication and wondered why 
the pile wa so heavy. 

Now volumes for a new term 
paper have inundated volumes 
for the last, and my Elements 
of Style has, without outside 
interference, sandwiched 
itself between an utterly 
usele ' I'l/llo's Who in Chaucer 
and an old Smith·Corona 
eraser cartridge, disem -
bowelled for longer use. 
Galsworthy forms a pedestal 
for Spinoza's Ethics, part of 
my learned books program. I 
go about the university and 
forget it in offices of people I 
wish to impress. Anot her 
useful one is the Vulgate ' 
Psaller, but this is dangerous 
in t hat the object of my efforts 
may know Latin . 

But buried life does not end 
at my desk. Climbing to 
heaven up my bookcases are 
piles of books resting on 
upright ones, waiting, like 
young graduates, for places to 
be filled. My mother keeps 
pu It ing her detect ive novels 
there in an easIly seen through 
subterfuge, pretending they 
are mine. My parents recently 
cut the top shelf off the family 
bookcase, and although it did 
not remove any shelf space 
they are using it as an excuse 
to disseminate the literature 

contai ned therein. 
On other s urfaces are 

impersonal assortment of 
volumes my family trembles 
from pulling back in the 
wrong places. But on the 
amplifier at my bedside basks 
the real me, in u s ual 
chronological order - an 
analysis treasure trove. At the 
bottom sits my middle sister's 
Alexander Pope, from early 
summer, On top of that is an 
indigestible translation of The 
Aeneid from a little later. Then 
there is E. Nesbit's The 
Phoenix and the Carpel, an 
August reversion tochildhood . 
Brideshead Nezlisiled seemed 
appropriate for the beginning 
of school. and above that are 
volumes of Browning and 
Arnold, out of which I chose 
bedtime reading, before they 
were buried by SermOllS of 
John D01l11e. The Sermons got a 
taste of its own medicine from 
an unworthy opponent, an 
airline brochure (we're gelling 
close to the Christmas 
vacation) . Piled above are 
CauliOllOry Tales for Children, 
by Belloc, another reversion; a 
Michelin guide to London (still 
closer to end of quarter); oneof 
three Doctors Faustus ' around 
my room; finally there is Max 
Beerbohm's Zuleika Dobson, 
unfinished and overdue until 
it is_ 

Before one goes to college 
one reads an excess of articles 
on how to survive there. They 
tell us to dress like prep 
schoolers , endear ourselves to 
professors, preserve our virtue 
(probably too late), and, most 
important, bring a popcorn 
popper. They never warn us 
about books, of the danger 
from their sudden prolificacy. 
A variety of libraries, book 
s tores, book sales, immorally 
expansive syllabi, literary 
friends and regular issues of 
The Times Literary SUPPle-
ment band together in a fateful 
explosion of ink and paper, 
spreadi ng literary shrapnel 
across bookshelves, bureaus, 
desks, amplifiers, chairs, 
occasiona l tables, closets, beds 
and rugs. Much the worst, 
they can spark spreading and 
unquenchable fire. My own 
first book already occupies two 
drawers and fifteen square 
feet of desktop, or, I should 
say, booktops.

7 straight 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Stall Writer 

With the score deadlocked at 
50, one second remained on the 
clock as Triton guard Paulette 
Parker toed the free throw 
stripe. Her free throw (on a 
one-on-one situation) would 
either propel the UCSD 
women 's hasketball team to 
victory, or send the contest 
against Azusa Pacific into 
overtime. A rather large , 
partisan Friday night crowd in 
Los Angeles heckled Parker as 
she took two dribbles ... a deep 
hreath ... bend of the knees ... 
and lofted the ball towards the

Runni~g Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Wri\('r~ 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT, One minute may ha\c 

cost the Intercollegiate Athletic Dep~rtme~t a couple hu~drcd 
dollars. By putting off the task of plaCIng a sIgn on the out <"Ideof 
Triton Pavilion advertising last Tuesday's men's ba"'k~tball 
game against Cal.B~ptist until just? few hour" before tlp-o~f, 
hundreds of potentIal fans were untnformed and thu<; not In 
attendance. After 1,000 plu. packed ~he Pavilion for ?l Spirit 
Night overt ime victory three days earlIer, one ",-ould thInk that 
the I.A. office would be alert enough to advertIse for t he ne~t 
UCSD home game. The blame ultimately goes to Ath!e.tlc 
Director Judy Sweet, since she o.versees . such pl;1bhClty 
operations. Judy Malone was also neglIgent, USIng the alJbl that 
she was busy preparing her team for two contests that weekend. 
Why didn't she relegate the duty to someone else? It' . ludicrous 
to lose hundreds of dollars because the person who makes the 
signs that promote the games was busy. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The retirement of 
Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Ly~n Swann. One of the all· 
time greats, Swann was recently hIred by ABC ports as a 
commentator on United States Football League telecasts. How 
would it have looked if he had taken a job with the NFL'~ chief 
rival while still being an active NFL player? ~est assl! red '. Swann 
will be back in uniform number 88 thIS July 10 lime for 
Pittsburgh's training camp. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, Hats off to Channel 8 for their 
excellent piece on the UCSD ba eball team's trip to China. 
During "News Eight Prime Tin:e," Hal Cle.ment.hosted a 30· 
minute segment which gave the vIewer a detaIled ItInerary of the 
club's actions on and off the field . The show captured all the 
high's and lows of what had to be an unforgettable trip. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Although the date has gone 
relatively unnoticed , tomorrow, February I, marks the date 
when over 200 NFL players are scheduled to ~come free agel}ts 
under new compensatio~ rules agreed to In th~ collectIve 
bargaining agreement. WIth the advent of the Untted States 
Football League, teams are expe.ct~ to make better .offers to free 
agents. The alternative of JOII}Ing the USFL glVe~ players 
increased bargaining power agaInst the NFL for the fIrst tIme. 
COULD IT BE DEPT_ Although we probably shouldn't lead 
the story out, one of our RUllI/in/! Thollg!lls correspondents (who 
will go nameless) has uncovered a major sport __ hapPCl11ng. It 
"ecms that AmerIcans arc becoming bor~d In the wi~ter rn~nths

No, t hey are n ' t pe rfect 
s hooter s. But they are perfect 
s h ow men , es pecia ll y #35, 
Geese Ausbie (his real name is 
Hubert , which is as good a 
reason as I can think of to 
cla im a nickna me). This man 
spends about 40% of t he t ime 
on the court , a nd the rest of the 
time in t he crowd, giving lit t ie 
kid, (and not·so·little kids) a 
thrill they'l l never forget. He 
enter the crowd at court level 
and plucks a little kid out of his 
nice, comfortable seat. He 
bring. the six year old to the 
10-foot high ba:-.ket and tells 
him to shoot. The kid mi"ses. 
!--o Geese takes off one of the 
boy \; shoes. " hoot aga In.'' 
Another miss. Anut her shoe 
off oon he has no shocs, no 
shirt, and another mIss. The 
Arena audience knows \\ hat's 
next to go, and as the bo~ sees 
the man before him reach for 
his size 6X pants, he cringes 
and the crowd roars. 

Women'., double .. partners Cathy Sturdivant and Brigit Rca sen'c and \ollcy in thcir match against La Verne. 

pats on the tooshie of a 
Washington player as the 
latter sets for a free throw, tne 
ludicrous antics with the 
officials, and the infamous 
"Sweet Georgia Brown" 
(so uvenir 45 rpm copies 
available in the lobby ) make 
the Harlem Globetrotters a 
ver\, funny :eam to see. And 
though one leaves realizing 
they aren't perfect sh(x)ter~, 
one lea\'es knOWing t hey are 
perfect shO\\ men. And no one 
leaves disappointed. 

W om.en' s tennis undefeated 
fnstead of tripping the boy 

to his underoos, Geese goes to 
the bench and brings back a 
'Trotters t·shirt. Three ~izes 
too large, but the boy doesn't 
care. When he's 75 vears old 
he' lI st ill have that s hirt . and 
he'll never forget the team 
whose emblem is on the front. 

Nor will most of the other 
spectators. The behind·lbe· 
back passes, the keep· away 
games, the re\'erse dunks. the 

conti nue d from page ] 3 
recorded a 5·7, 7·5. 6·3 victory. 
Also wrapping up their first 
matches were fourth seed 
Dina Neal and Fifth seed 
Brigid Rea, notching 6-1. 6·2 
and 7·5, 6·] \'ictories 
respecti\·ely. 

The match with theweak La 
Verne squad was not even thaI 
clo"e. Only one of the top six 

se('(]s lost as many as four 
games in a !-lingles match; most 
sets \\'ere of the 6·0, 6-1 
variety. One of the doubles 
matches, a 6·-1, 4·6, 6·4 
triumph by the duoof Akimoto 
and Gilbert. was close. One 
match wasn't close; the other 
wasn't played. 

'The girls appear confident, 
says Coach Dudash , who also 

appeared more confident after 
the impressive opener. With 
the season just under way, the 
Triton women havea long way 
to go to make the National" to 
be held in the second week of 
May. Dudash hopes to take the 
team to the Nationals and 
finish beller than last years' 
team, a high aim considering 
that this mean s finishing III in 
the nation .
