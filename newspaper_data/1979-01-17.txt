By Monet Payton 
tan Writer 

All financial aid funds with 
the exception of Ed Fee and 
bank loans have been expended 
this year, according to Deputy 
Director of Financial Aid Fred 
Hes inger. 

" There are many more 
students applying for financial 
aid than in previous years," he 
said, "and many more 
receiving financial aid. and 
receiving more per eapita of 
financial aid dollars per 
tudent. We are committing the 

money and subsequently 
utilizing it at a faster clip than 
we ever have in the la t 4 year , 
o we ar in a dramatically 

different ituation. 
The pattern of most major 

in titutions , expluined He-
inger. i that they pend their 

fund prior to the opening of fall 
quarter and then have to make 
priorities among students to 
give money to, becau e they 
don't have sufficient funds for 
the entire population. "As far 
as we can tell , we had sufficient 
money for all eligible student 
through the fall quarter," he 
said. 

According to Hessinger, the 
Financial Aid Offices do not 
have a heavy innux of students 
in the winter and spring. Those 
that do come in and are eligible 
will be o((ered Ed Fee and a 
bunk loon, these being the only 
funding availuble. 

Said Hes inge .. " (don't think 
. thut there would be any really 
good point to try and hold some 
money buck for potential new 
tudent when you already 

have orne bonu fide n edy 

student who are already in the 
academic program. 

"It' possible for tudent 
who are entering in spring and 
winter to apply at the arne 
time as the fall quarter 
tudents, and to be awarded 

money wh n money i till 
available. " 

He 'inger said that "Our 
priorities have been m t a far 
as we're concerned . Any 
tudent who applied on time 

was given the best po ible 
package that wa available."

applying for financial aid

deadline for all the applicution 
material. All ub qu nt 
material should be complet d

SE ~sian Border Disputes: Background 
By Gareth Porter 

Pacillc News Service 
(Garetb Porter recently 
returned from his liftb visit to 
Vietnam where be interviewed 
numerous high level officials as 
a guest 01 the government. 
Former co-director of the 
Indochina Resource Center and 
a consultant to the House MfA 
Committee, Porter is the 
author of A Peace Denied, a 
history of the Paris Peace 
Agreement. He is now 
completing a two-volume 
compilation of documents on 
the Vietnam war.) 

The bold Vietnamese move to 
unseat the Pol Pot regime in 
Cambodia is the outcome of a 
series of developments which 
destroyed the elegant power 
balance established in 
Indochina after the victories of 
the Vietnamese and Cam-
bodian revolutionary move-
ments in April 1975. 

the Cambodian regime a lesson 
a nd force a negotiated 
settlement. 

Instead, Cambodia stepped 
up its own attacks across the 
bord e r and s purned a 
Vietnamese ofCer to withdraw 
'troops five kilomete rs behind 
the border and esta blish an 
international presence between 
the two sides to insure a cease 
fi r e . L ater, Vietnamese 
officia ls would attest that they 
h a d underestimated the 
seriousness of the Cambodian 
attacks. "In Cuct, we somewhat 
looked down on them," said a 
Central Committee member in 
Hanoi last Novem ber. 

The failure of the Vietnamese 
effort to shake the Cambodian 
regime from its truculent 
slance undoubtedly created 
strong pressures from the 
military for a more carefully 
planned and ultimately 
s ucces ful campaign in 
Cambodia. 

territori<ll issues would 
ultimately invite aggression by 
Vietn<lm. 

Accord i ng to Politic a I 
Bureau member Xuan Thuy. in 
an intervjew la t November, 
the Cambodian delegation to 
preliminary border l;;Ilks in 
May 1976 demanded eleven 
changes in the las t French map 

of the border which had 
previously been accepted as the 
busis for border demureation. 
When the Vietnamese reCused 
to uccept chunges, Cambodian 
delegates suspended the talks 
to consult with Phnom Penh 
and never res umed negoti-
utions . 

The amhodian ambassador 

in Hanoi, In Sivout, told a 
European diplomat in Septem-
ber 1977 that Phnom ' Penh 
would not negotiate a border 
agreement with Vietnam 
unless Vietnamese troops were 
first withdrawn from contested 
areas - a position which ruled 
out any possible diplomatic 

(Please tUrD &0 pale 8) 

J I 

The factors which combined 
to elimi nate that balance 
included Cambodia's own 
provocative border policy, the 
deterioration of Chinese-
Vietnamese relations , the 
growing Chinese role in 
supporting Cambodia against 
Vietnam , and the weakening of 
Pol Pot's regime because of 
military insurrections and 
purges. 

The circumstances at the 
close of the war in 1975 held 
Vietnam tightly in check. 
Concerned about maintaining 
friendly relations with China, 
which regarded' Cambodian 
in dep endence as vital, 
Vietnamese foreign policy also 
required normal relations with 
Southeast Asia as well as with 
the United States. So Hanoi 
leaned over backwards in 1975-
76 to avoid the appearance of 
aggressiveness in its relations 
with Cambodia . 

By early 1978, the Viet-
namese began to realize that 
the Cambodian attacks on 
Vietnamese border settlements 
and towns were a serious a nd 
long-term threat, aimed at 
creating a " no man's land" in 
the border a rea. Thousands of 
Vietnamese civilians living 
near the border were mas-
sacred by Cambodian troops, 
a nd a general climate of 
insecurity in the border 
provinces prevailed. Hundreds 
of thousands of people were 
forced to abandon the two 
economic zones which had been 
expected to provide productive 
employment for the jobless 
from the cities in the South. 
This coincided with in -
creasingly serio u s food 
shortages throughout Vietnam, 
which intensified after 
devastating floods last 
September wiped out three 
million tons of paddy.

Beckley Hiring Justifiable 

Moreover , Vietnamese 
officials did not regard 
Cambodian border attacks in 
1976-77 as an immediate threat 
and were still confident that 
Cambodia would have to 
negotiate a border settlement. 
When Vietnamese troops

attack in late 1977, Hanoi

The dated material in your

<Inti-shah Iranian students in 
this country . 

Saying that the U.S. " Caces 
serious Guestions" about the

fin al demand was that alleged 
U.S. milita ry inte rvention in

Rezai e told the gathering that 
the ISA does not support 
violence by its members in the 
U.S. He did, however , say that 
they would " not let the shah 
leave in less than a million 
pieces ." When a s ked to 
elaborute, Rezaie said , " We 
don ' t ha ve an electric s aw 0 
effici e nt, unfortunately . But 
what we do have is a hard 
hea rt. .. 

" Please do not worry about 
how we handle 'King Tor-
ture,' " Rez a ie said. (He 
remarked that " millions" of 
Irania n a ttach this na me to the 
shah , while President Carter 
reCers to him as the " benevo-
lent s hah ." ) 

Reza ie a lso cha rged the U.S. 
with distorting the political 
revolution in Iran. " The media 
has presented it as a Moslem 
revolution, but itis n' t," he a id. 

U.S .. according to Rezaie. 
When asked a bout the rec ent 

Iranian student protest in 
Beverly Hills. Rezaie said that 
" it did get a little out of hand." 
He added that the press had 
covered up much of the protest 
by (aUma to depict alleged 
police "~&ity. " . 

According to Reza ie, ma~y of 
the ISA students involved in 
yesterday 's rally are currently 
enrolled at UCSD. The group 
will conduct rallies at other 
campuses in California , he 
said. 

Rezaie said that the rally's 
UCSD audience gave him an 
" inCormative reaction" a nd a 
" warm" reception. 

One locul television crew and 
the Sun Diego Union were 011

Work Study i a fin ancial a id 

award wherein eligibili ty is 
determined only by need. This 
progra m , which requires 
students to work in order to 
r e ceive financi a l a id , is 
basically the same throughout 
the UC System in that all the 
ca mpuses operate under the 
sa me federa l guidelines . 

Says Hessinger, " It is a 
m a tching program that must 
be matched at least by 20% 
from outside sources, other 
than federa l source a nd the 
primarily Work Study ources. 
It ca n be a ma tch higher than 
20%, but 20% is the minimum, 
a nd we collect only the 
minimum from our depart-
ments." 

The program is de igned for 
both on a nd off c ampu s 
pa rticipation . The on campus 
con s ists of any official 
undergraduate department 
and the off campus is made up 
of non-profit agencies thut 
a pply for acceptance into the 
off campus program . 

" We don ' t have to accept any 
off campus [agencies) as far as 
the federal government ' s 
concerned," said Hes i~ger. 
"We do that pril'f\arily as a 
service to students, because it 
is a very time-consuming, 
puper-Juden process. F.rom the 
management 's standpoint, we 
would prder not to even have 
an off campus program . 

" We huve students thut have

Argentinians Edge Triton Ki,ckers, 3 2 
The biggest crowd this year 

for a UCSD soccer game, well 
over a hundred people, turned 
out last Friday afternoon to 
wa t ch a visiting Argentina 
team edge past the UCSD 
occer club's first team 3-2 a t 

Muir field . 
The ra re chance to see 

inte rn<1tional players mu s t 
have helped bring out the 
spectators a nd the a cce sible 
place and time also probably 
helped, according to inter-
collegiate soccer coach Stewart 
Hayes. 

Whatever they came for, 
wha t they saw was a lively 
ga me in which both teams 
threatened each others goals

Men's volleyball coach Doug 
Da nnevik feel s his team is " not 
r ea dy yet for the big 
competition, but will be soon." 
However, at last weekend'sAII-
Ca l in Davis the Tritons played 
li ke they were ready for 
anything, pla Cing fourth in the 
tourn a ment behind UCLA , 
UCSB (two nationally ranked 
tea m s) and UCB. 

Or the top four teams UCSDls 
the orily school that does not 
oC fe r sc liolarships to it 
uthl ete . " The other teams 
were bigger a nd stronger than 
us, which wus lo be expected. " 
ex pl a ined D ... nnevik , "We 
really hustled after the ball , 
thoug h. " 

" The other teams sent the 
b:J 1l ucro s the net u lot Custer 
than we are used to. We didn 't 
rcact fas t enough. These three

he s aid . 

"We (UCSD) ha d many more 
opportunities to score , but 
didn ' t take adv a ntage of 
them," he aid. " Their mas te ry 
of skill s rea lly showed in front 
of the goal. " 

What the crowds didn ' t ee, 
unle s they li ved in one of the 
five dorms (four Revelle, one

Both s ide a fte rward agreed 
that the Latin American team 
was deficient in " m arking" or

the ball more, stringing more

Tom Chapin ill , play a 
concert at the UCSD Gym this 
Friday night at 8: 00 pm. 
Tickets will be $3.00 for 
students, $4.00 Cor general 
admission. Chap n, probably 
best known as " Harry's 
brother, " has himself been 
praised by many critics for his 
onstage panache. clear voice 
and formidable songwriting 
abilities . He has written ongs 
for films , perform e d on 

Border 
Dispute 

(Continued from page 2) 
solution. 

The Vietnamese might have 
attempted some other mean of 
olving the border problem, 

however . had they not begun in 
1978 to consider the Po l Pot 
regime as an arm of thei r real 
enemy - China. 

Ironically, it was China's 
milita r y and political upport 
Co r Ca mbodia t hat cau ed 
Hanoi to concl ude that China 
was deliberately thr atening 

ietnam's security, tability 
and eco nomic deve lopment. 
After China b gan to attack 
Vietnam openly Cor it alleged 
mi treatment oC et h nic 
Chine e, and withdrew its aid 
program in May of 1978. the 
Vietname e decided that hina 
ha d to be con idered as 
Vietna m 's mai n enemy . At a 
secret Ce nt ra l Co m mittee 
plenum in mid-J uly . Viet-
name e party leaders pa ed a 
resolution recognizing China a 
the enemy. 

By that time. accord ing to a 
Centra l Committee ource, the 
Viet n amese saw China's 
ho tility in bilateral relations 
with Vietnam and the border 
war with Cambodia a "one 
war. " 

The logical implication wa 
that the Phnom Penh regim 
wa not attacking i tnam 
becaus e of Cambodian 
interes ts, but was ervi ng the 
intere ts oC China. 

The Vietname e broadca t 
la t June 22 oC a Cormer 
battalion commander' call for 
Cambodian troops to turn their 
gun a gainst the Pol Pot regime 
wa a signal that Hanoi 's ai ms 
were no longer to .reach a 
negotiated settlement but to 
overthrow the incumbent 
government. 

The Vietname e were al 0 
em boldened by intern a l 
uprisings against the Pol Pot 
regime. extensive political 
purges carried out in 1977-78 
aga inst civilian and mi litary 
officials a t a ll levels, a nd by 
Cambodian deCections to the 
Vietna mese side. 

Vietnamese . ources claimed 
a se ries of mu ti nies a nd 
insurrections l,y units of the 
Ca mbodian ar my, mostly in 
eastern Cambcdia . 

By m id-1978 , a number of 
middle and up:>er leve l cadres 
Crom Phnom Hmh'5 arm:; ::: :1d 
pa rty were pre pa r e d to 
collaborate di. :-ectly with the 
Vietnamese i) overthrowing 
the Pol Pot regime . The 
Vietnamese believed they 
would be able w put together a 
Cambodian regime to replace 
the Pol Pot government when it 
wa s " necessary . The only 
question remaining then wa 
the precise timing of the 
lightning offensive which ended 
the world 's mos t radi c al 
e~periment in revolution.
