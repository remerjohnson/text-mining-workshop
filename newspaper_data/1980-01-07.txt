News Editor 
Scienti.t. from the People's 

Republic of CIuna, here last month and 
now scheduled for a Jan. 16 vilit, are 
considering making UCSD one of the 
nation's leading school. for their 
studenta. . 

A • mid·December visit by a number 
of top·level Chinese education offici"" 
including several university vice· 
presidents, adding to' the number of 
"~aonal ~ta" China has with 
UCSD, an impOrtant factor in the 
number of faculty exchanges, 
according to Audtant Chancellor Pat 
Ledden. 

"China is ~ places to send 
doctoral and .tudents, and 
UCSD is on their list," Ledden said. 
. ''This group came from aD over the 

couptry to look at UCSD. The only 
other place they looked at on the west 
cout is UCLA. 

'~They aIao wanted to examine the 
problems of running a large university., 
so they were particularly interested in 
visiting San Diego State and San Diego 
City College while they were here. 
They even a.ked for another day at 
City College," Ledden said. 

'1f you're in the bu.iness of 
educating a bimon people, you're 
interested in how to go about doing that 
at a leu research·oriented place," he 
added. . 

But the January visit will be for ~ 
group composed only of scientist. who 
want to learn about research on 
campus. 

Ledden haa already sent the group, 
which will also be in San Francisco 

later this week for an American 
Association for the Mdvancement of 
Science convention, copies of the 
.UCSD catalog and department. 
prepared handbook. on research 
specialties. 

(The catalog. are copies of those 
translated and prepared by linguists in 
the Pf'C?j)Ie's Republic in honor of 
Chancellor McFJroy's visit there last 
September· 

The group will consi.t of nine or ten 
academicians specializing in a variety 
of disciplines, 'from astronomy to 
chemistry. 

The AAASA group will aM') be 
guests at a university house banquet 
Tuesday night, then spend the rest of 
the week at San Diego State 
University, KPBS studio., the zoo, and 
the Salk Institute. 

Apartments Threatened 
By John Hondros 

Auoc:iate New. Editor 
Over the vacation, while mOlit 

student. wondered if they got aU their 
classes, tenants at the Villa La Jolla 
apartments worried about having a 
place to live. 

The city Planning Commission last 
month ,ave the go-ahead for the 
planned conversion to condominiums 
of the 500 apartment units near UCSD 
by ~ to halt the plisn. 

UeSD Will appeal the commi .. ion'. 
decision on Jan. 22, according to · 
Senioa: PIamer Pat eo~\..-n. 

On a 4-2 vote, the Planning 
Commiuion decided they had no 
jurisdiction because, they claimed, 
nowhere in the original University City 
Community Plan does it state that 
concIominiwn conver.ions are not 
allowed. 

Collum said the commissioners were 
more concerned with the specific 
language of the community plans than 
about the "social implications" of the 
conversion planned by E.E.S. La Jolla 
Associates. 

Of the 500 apartments in the 
complex, 87 (with 3 or 4 .tudents per 
unit) are rented by UCSD students, 
Collum said. In addition, about 25 
units are rented to UCSD faculty and 
staft members. 

UCSD is appealing to the City 
Council because "we are worried about 
what will happen to these .tudent.," 
CoRum said. 

But, she said, the university'. 
aUorney "does not feel UCSD has a 
chance.". . 

"If this conversion i. aBowed, it will 
most likely have an impact on the 
waitin,r Ii.t for on houaing 

here," Collum said. UCSD presently 
houses 35 percent of the gtudents, she 
said, which is the second highest rate in 
the UC .ystem. 

There are pre.ently about 1,000 
rental units located within three miles of 
the campus. accordinR to a university 
survey. The Villa La Jolla conversion 
will eliminate half of those available. 

She .aid it would be a year before the 
'tenants are affected by the conversion. 

In an editorial, the LA lolla Light 
criticized the PlanniniJ~ Commission for 
refusing to hear UCSD's appeal, 
.aying it "mined the point 
com..J!letel . " 

"The lJe plan does not use the exact 
words 'condo conveNion.' When it was 
written in the early 1970., the term 
was I)Ot in common usage. Instead the 
plan say. it i. 'imperative that some

What's In a Mane? Hair of Any Other Length ... · 
By Marcia Brilbois 

Plea,e He (or me i( her hoir Iao",s longs, 
If it roll. and floWI all down her brea.t, 
PIeGH au for me i/lwr hoir "ang. long, 
Thar's rite UJQII I remember her besr. 

, -·Bob Dylan 
The night after Halloween I lay on the floor, 

swearing, while I tried to untangle the pink ribbon I'd 
braided into my hair. I thought back wi.tfully to the 
morning I allowed my former hairdr"ser to give me a 
crew cut. 

Marc:'a Bri.bol. i. a graduate .rudent in Engll.h 
Ii rerarure. 

"Donald, I'~ sick of this bowl haircut. How long 
can a person walk around looking like Hans 
Brinker?" I bit my lip and gazed at the rest of the 
salon's clientele, most of whom were in for their bi· 
weekly bluing. (Remember when Grandma came 
home from the beauty parlor and you thought ,he 
was the blue fairy from Pinnochio?) Obviously no 
model. for Donald i. this group. 

"Just cut if all off," I said, figuring he'd do ju.tthat 
an)"!ay. Mom alway. told me that all male 
hairdressers hate women and try to make us look 
ugly. I didn't think that Donald hated me. Granted , 
once we'd talked about Warren Beatty in Shampoo, 
we never did pick up the thread of conversation. 

I tried not to look at my reflection wh~e he clipped 
and clucked. Before he .tarted to blow it dry I peeked 
and remembered Donald Duck when he faDa into a 
puddJe and his het come. off, revealing a ma .. of 

spiky, upright feathers. I .hut my eyes. 
"You re fini.hed," Donald said. He handed 1111! a 

mirror. It was short, all right, about an inch long all 
over. He'd left enough to bru.h back over the tip. of 
my ear., nothing extra. I felt Iille my name should be 
III¥ and I'd better watch. out for chicken hawk. on 
the bike ride home. 

But it felt pat. The August afternoons that 
usually made the back of my neck feel like a wet 
porcupine didn't eveJl bother me. I could 10 for alUn 
or a swim, then just whip a comb through my hair, 
and I'd look slick. That'. what 't was - a feeling of 
control over what had been heretofore an 
wvnanageable medium. My hair wouldn't be ty!"¥. 
itself in knots all night long anymore; it wouldn t 
immediately fall into my dinner when I leaned over 
my plate. It wouldn't fly aero .. my' face when I 
bicycled, filling my mouth' and eye •. And it would 
never come unmoored again, .hedding hair pin II, 
combs and barettes onto car seats . 

. On the other hand, it didn't do any of those 
romantic thing. touted in songs, books or pictures. It 
didn't cascade, roll, fall, flow, .pill or even hang down 
any parts of my anatomy. No one could run hi. 
fingers through it. silky length. And when I bicycled 
or jogged, motori.tl would slow down and gawk, but 
at Iea.t they didn't hoot. . 

In1he western culture the idea of womanline •• hal 
been tied up with hair length for centuries. It wasn't 
until the 1920'. that American women began to cut 
their hair, thou'" even then bobbed hair was 
considered to be eVidence of moral degeneracy. Only 

in the 19601 did long hair regain popularity and then 
for both .exes. (How' many men that you know atill 
sport fJowini( lock.?) Unfortunately the return to long 
hair and the lifestyle it rellected carried with it some of 
the more traditional aspects of femininity. When 
Brad and Terry bought the OIJanic f.rm, or decided 
to subsilt on homegrown produdI. who got stuck in 
the kitchen canning the organic tomatoes? Who 

~t hours kneading, pr.ying .over and baIcing the 
homemade bread? 

And who got photographed breastfeedina the 
baby at the rally? Not dad. The image of Earth 
Mama took women back ten rearl. If you bottlefed 
your baby you were part o. a h"!tJe corpor~ti~. 
baaed! capitalill/lJea\D'eaucratic SWIndle, depnvmg 
tiny infants of the purity of natural mothen' milk and 
the .piri~ua1 comfort. of her brea.t. But, more 
pragmatically; you deprived dad of his ability to 
participate in those 4 am feedings. 

At least hairstyles in the 19601 were no·nonsense. 
You parted it in the middle and let it hang. Then came 
Farrah Fawcett. You not only had to have lots of 
hair, but you had to spend hours curling it ~ achieve 
those unattractive sauaage roll. on each .ide of the 
face. If there is anythina to be said ror disco, it is that 
frenetic dancing might promote mort, comfortable

US Calls On Soviets To 
Withdraw Troops 

':JNITF.D NA nONS. - The United States urged the Soviet 
~mon . yesterday to WIthdraw its troops from Afghanistan 
Immediately, and asked· the UN Security Council to denounce 
the Soviet intervention there. 

US Ambassador Donald F. McHenry called the Soviet action 
in Afghanistan a "dangeroua breach of peace and security" and 
"a terrible miacalculation ... by Soviet authorities." 

He described the Dec. 27 coup in the A fghan capita) of Kabul 
ali ~vi~t.engineered and rejected the Kremlin's claims that it 

wa~ mVlted by the Afghan. govenunent to send in military 
assistance. 

Referring to the overthrow oJ Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin 
by p,ro.Moscow Babrak Kannal, McHenry asked: 

, Are ~e to believe. that ~resident Amin invited Soviet troops 
to come mto A(gharustan In order to oversee his own downfall 
and his own execution.?" 

Also yesterday, McHenry predicted the council would 
approve economic sanctions against Iran when it considers that 
issue again this morning. "It (the vote for sanctions) will go 
through," McHenry told The Auociated PI"CfS. 

M~Henry. was first on the speakers' list for yesterday's 
meetmg to diacuss the presence of some 100,000 Soviet troops 

re~rted in Afgha~stan .sinc~ Am!" was. ~eposed ~ executed. 
. That the SoVIet Uruon .. taking military action aiainst a 

deeply . religiou. and fiercely dependent . people. who are 
struggling for human and religious rights, underscores the 
'>rutaJity. and i~gality of its action," McHenry declared. 

. He said the first announcement of the coup againat ~n and 
his replacement by Karmal. who had been in exile in eaatern 
Europe, came from radio transmitters ih the Soviet Union 
pu~rting to be ~dio Kabul. . 

We know this because the real Radio Kabul continued 
normaltransmiuion. for at lea.t one and a half hour. after these 
announcements were first heard. Nothing in these broadcaats 
from Kabul confirmed the content ot the Soviet broadca.t 
disseminated in Afghanistan's name," he said. 

. MC.Henry called the Soviet intervention "a grail and blatant 
vlolabon of the mOlt important principles of interna60nallaw 
and of the United Nations Charter" and stated: 

:'No .~te w.iU be ~e against a larger and more powerful 
neighbor if the mtemabonal community appear. to condone !he 
Soviet Union's armed intervention ... 

"It is therefore incumbent upon this council and upon every' 
!:,a~ion that. believe. i~ the rule of law and opPOlel the use of force 
m mtemabonal aff81ra to den9Unce this dangeroua breach of 
peace and aecurity."

"On the whole, Ilhink that.in spite of 
.... McNamara affair, she has not 
... ·lIIienateci the faculty ... They atiU 
..... abe has .. enormous amount 
aI MiIity." sa,. ODe faculty member. 

She liM .roed in on the problems

&n..ciaI crunch, where the private 
... _:ia .nv_lit)' it headed, and how 

which si~ell an insight into the multi· 
faceted, taU, gray·haired woman. 

Vibrant gray·greeen eyes set the 
animated tone for this Renaissance and 
Reformation historian who once 
wanted to be a radio comedienne, lovta 
playing darts and is an avid footbaD 
Jan. 

She's been caDed brusque, efficient, 
cold, distant. She's not described, 
though, as stuffy or formal. 

"I ,ot some of the stuffiness knocked 
out of me in coDege," she said when 
named president. 

"Her administration is characterized 
by a great deal of informality," no~ 
political science professor DaVId 
tuton, "and she's Ie .. likely to .Iock 
heraelf into a comer by standing on 
fann and past IJ!ocedures and more 
likely to be flexible." 

At .he aits on a straight.backed sofa 
in her ~c:ioua, modernly fumiahed 
white-walled office with a view onto the 
luah ~, tree·covered quadrantde 
surroUnded by impressive sTay Gothic 
building, there is no question she is 
busineUlike. But her face and manner 
are expressive - smilins, frowning, 
contemplative as she chooses her 
words carefully, laut{ha infectioualy. 

"We aU know that the age of 
growth is over, the age of growth that 
characterized in particular the late '50s , 
and '60s univeraitiea," she says -
because of flagging economic f.'0wth, 
because of inflation, which 'is our 
worst and continuing problem" 
plaguing private institutions. ''We 
knOw that the age of growth ill over in 
terms of the students population." 

And she questions whether growth is 
"nec:eaaarilv 'good' for a given irutitub~tf

do "some slimming down." 
That trim·down hasn't - been 

tranalated into faculty cuts yet, but she 
I18)'S it means analyzing the heavy 
professional and graduate school 
emphasis at Chicago, which boasts 43 
Novel Prize winners among faculty 
and alumni, amid decreasing job 
opportunities. 

"I thing that what we want to do is to . 
maintain the trinity, so to lipeak, that 
we have of undergraduate, graduate . 
and professional training, and the 
interaction between those three forms 
of training which are characterstic of 
this university," she says. 

Her plans to increase the coUege's 
size from 2,700 students to about 
3,000 led to student and faculty 
grousing. 

Some complain that the coDege, 
renowned since the 1930. for its 
"Common Core" curriculum of 
general education, is bursting and 
floundering with overcrowded daaea, 
too many optional courses and too few 
professors teaching. 

Mrs. Gray has been criticized for 
being a director of J.P, Morgan & Co. 
ancI its banking subsidiary, Morgan 
Guaranty Trust Co., and (or Morgan 
Guaranty's reaffirmint its option to 
make South African loans. 

She'. also been criticized for the 
university'. sizeable investments. in 
South Africa.. but says divestment is 
"incompatible" with the trustees' 
responsibility to manage university 
funds. 

The biggest furor she's been 
involved with since returning to 
Chicago, where she had taught for 12 
years, was the $25,000. 
Albert Pick Jr. Award the university 
IJlive to former Secretary of Defense 
McNamara, now president of World 
Bank. A f.:ulty committee chose him 

for "outstanding contributions to 
international understanding." 

Many student and faculty member.s 
fumed over honoring McNamara, I 
defense secretary during the Vietnam 
War; at least 232 profe.sors and 
instructors .igned petitions ' opposing 
the award and a day.long 
demonstration' led to the arrest of 17 

. students. 
Many chafed over what was 

perceived as a departure from the 
university's tradition of honoring 
persons only for significant scientific, 
scholarly or artistic achievement. 

Mu. Gray's predecessor; John T. 
Wilson, had appointed the committee 
that cholle McNamara, but she refused 
to reliCind the award. 

She told the faculty llenate, "The 
pre!leJltation of awards ... will often be in 
liome way controversial. But no 
corporate political endorsement is 
implied on the part of the university." 

Ali f.,r the coDege curriculum, she 
praities the "CommOn Core" principle, 
which Harvard University recently 
readopted and has been hailed a. a 
recommitment to llerious higher 
education, as an e55e1ltial part of her 
"ideal curriculum." 

The core, she I18YS, introduceli 
student to the common intellectual 
experience, the cukural tradition, 
language, quantitative methodli: "The 
basic principle of a core curriculwn 811 
the fundament of a student's 
undergraduate education ... is a very 
good one." 

She views her gender as something 
that basicaUy ought to be irrelevant: 
"The buaine .. o[being a fuII·fledaed 
academic adminilltreator i. ~ething 
that ought to be unrelated to sex," but 
her accomplishments have highlighted 
it.

Mind Over Menstrual Cycle · Possible?

Staff Wrifer 

The menstrual cycle, at first thought 
to I>e controlled exclusively by the

some time to be subject to influence by 
lower brain functioni. 

Now . a UCSD medical school 
professor thinks those lower brain

By Peter Mortensen 

Science Editor 
Another UCSD scientist has been 

honored with the V..M. Goldschmidt 
Medal, the American Geochemical 
Society's highest honor. 

Harmon Craig of .Scripps became 
the fourth UCSD scientist to win the 
honor in seven years, joiniJ')g Profes.or 
emeritus Harold Urey, Hans SeUSl and 
Robert Garrels (now at Northwestern). 

Craig, head of the Isotope 
Laboratory at Scripps; is currently 
working on a search for ocean ridge-
crest hydrothermal circulation data 
found during the Baja California deep-
sea dives. 

Craig is a recognized authority on 
isotopic processes and a member of the 
National Science Foundation's three-
man committee that directs the

(GEOSECS in the trade), which 
studies food-chain nutrienta and water 
pollution in the Atlantic, Pacific and 
Indian oceans.

leading to his startling conclusion that 
the cycle may someday be brought 
"under the control of conscious or 
deliberate will." 

Menstruation is the averalJe five ~ay 
period of the reproductive cycle when 
the enometrium (inner rllling of the 
uterus) of a non-pregnant woman 
breaks and sheds. 

Dr. A.lIen Lein, physiologist and 

professor of reproductive medicine at 
UCSD has been involed in research 
linking the higher and lower brain 
functions to the operation of the 
menstrual cycle. 

Ac<;ording to Lein, it is a rather 
novel idea that the brain is in control at 
all. "For years and years it was 
believed that the pituitary gland was 
the masler gl~nd, but the pituitary

Decades ago, scientillta discovered 
the link between the hypothalamua (the 
lower primitive section of the brain 
controUing circulation, respiration, and 
body temperature), and the pituitary 
gland located directly . below it in the 
form of an arterial blood Row.lti.onIy

flow has beguh to be underatood . 

If the How illl diarUpted and the 
pituitary i. isolated from the brain, the 
pituitary c~ea to produce hormones. 
Scientilllta believe that the blood flow 
descending from the upper brain ''tipa 
oH" the pituitary to begin ' hormone 
production. . 

Over the pa.t 50 yeara, scientista 
have discovered at least six separate 
pituitary honnones, two of which aHect 
the menstrual cycle directly. 

By isolating and .ynthe.iling theae 
hormone., physioloSi.t. hope to 
correct malfunctions of the cycle, and 
examine the possibility of an advent in 
birth control. 

Diacovery oi the role of the 
hypothalamus in the reproductive

to point out the influence of the upper 
brain or cerebrum OD the 
hypothalamus, and thus the eHect of 
intellectual and emotional atimuli over 
reproduction and men.tNalion. 

Although the link between the

W'omen's V-ball 4th • In Nat'l Tourney 
~Goetz Editor 

The women'. volleyball 
team finiahed fourth in last 
month'. AlA W Division III 
national tournament at 
Occidental College in Los 
Angeles, breaking into the top 
echelons of the sport in their 
first national competition. 

"Nobody can take ualightly 
anymore, and that'.. what I 
wanted," said Doug 
Dannevik, who finished his 
first year as coach of the team. 
"U you had asked me at the 
beginning of the season if the 
team should be nationally 
ranked. I'd have said 'Hell no!' 

Elaine Bergman was named 
to the All-American team, 

adding a final distinction to her 
season, where she has earned 
AU· League, All Region, and 
AU.Toumament honors. Her 
powerful hitting played an 
important part in the team's 
succelS. 

"She's the offensive 
backbone of the team," says 
the coach. "We let her three 
times as much as anyone 
else ... she's improved in 
confidence because of aU her 
awards." , 

UCSD entered the 
tournament seeded fifth, and 
began with an early morning 
defeat by Wisconsin CoUege 
15·2 and 15· 3 on December 
6. They came back to beat two 
other out-of-.tate schools, and 

advanced to the final round of 
competition with seven other 
teams. 

In the first round, the 
Tritons faced Sacramento 
State, who had fallen to UCSD 
earlier in the state 
champicnships in Sacramen· 
to. UCSD again beat them in 
two straight, 15· 7 and 15-13. 

The win pitted the Tritons 
against Azusa Pacific, who 
had not lost a single game to 
UCSD in three encounters 
during the season. Azusa kept 
ill record intact, winning 15· 
13 and 15·5, and eventually 
won the national title. 

UCSD dropped to the 
loser's bracket and beat 
Wisconsin·Stevens Point, then 

lost to Sacramento State 19· 
17, 13.15, 15.13, for a fourth 
place finish. Sacramento 
finished second, and UC Davis 
took third in the tourney, 

The finish capped the 
Triton's CindereUa sealOn, in 
which they turned into a 
national contender after only a 
7·13 lealOn in 197A. 

Starting with their fir.t 
game, when they beat league 
opponent Cal Lutheran in 
three straight games, 
Dannevik knew that hi. team 
could compete on the Division 
III level succellfuUy. 

They began roUing up wins 
against everyone in their 
league-exc,Dt Azusa. 
"When we 100t to Azusa in 

three straight, we realized we 
weren't contenders yet. We 
still had to work hard, n said 
Dannevik. 

The team's confidence WBI 
growing, and a first place 
finish in the We.tmont · 
Tournament in Novemel' 
helped team spirit. Then they 
took third place in the regional 
tournament in which theY were 
aeeded only leventh goins in. 

"By then we knew we were 
of national quality, " _ya 
Dannevik: The team finiat-ed 
the season with a 12-3 record, 
1980 could be even better. AD 
eight players wiD return for 
another seaaon, and Dannevik 
has already started recJUiting 
high school player. for 1980.

apoHed a receiver and lofted a

receiver dove at the Linguist

catching the pall and giving 
the Scalpell -the victory.

For exam ,Lein notes, ,m. tatqrht that menstruation i. a

difficult time adjusting physically and emotionally with their 
cycle. 

"The human female has frequently been .ub;ected to 
menlbual.reIateci diaaimination," Lein said. "She has been told 
that becaUie of her cycle she is sometimes emotionally and 
inIeIIedually unstable, that dwing her menstrual period she is 
unclean, that she must then be isolated and remain untouched, 
and that she may even be danger_ou •. 

''"Theee are some of the so·called men.m-.a1 taboos embracoo 
.by a number of primitive and some modern societies. In some 
aocieties, it is believed that the men.truating woman is a danger 
to the entire community because she will cause the food lliupply to

When a film lacks the plot, 
script, acting, and the 
technical brilliance necessary 
to justify its existence, the 
smart producer relys on 
special effects and calls it a 
speetable. This would be the 
only suitable appellation for 
Star Trek, the Motion Picture, 
under the broadest and most . 
charitable definition of the 
term 'llipeetacle.' The film does 
not justify the budget, so it is a 
good bet that it will be 
rescreened on television as the 
pilot (or an upcoming series, 
considering the sUllipiciously 
inconclusive ending. Or, 

should a projected series be 
canned, the door has been left 
wide open for the sequel,
