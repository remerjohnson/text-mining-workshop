Pay for graduate students varies 
among departments, report says 

By CHRlmNE KWON 
Senior Staff Writer 

Wages for UCSD graduate stu-
dent researcher assistants may vary 
by as much as $3,000, according to 
data from a new study released by 
the Clmmicle of High/!T Education. 

The October study reported 
discrepancies between graduate 
pay at UCSD departments, 
including biology, economics and 
history. While graduate student 
research assistants in the biology 
department receive $17,325 in an 
academic year, those in economics 
are paid $14,157 and wages for 
history department researchers 
are less than $10,000 .. 

The study also showed that 
while wages for research assistants 
vary from department to depart-
ment, teaching assistants in all 
deparnnents are paid the same. 

The discrepancy can partly be 
attributed to each department's cur-
riculum as well as their availability 
to fund research, history depart-
ment chair Daniel Vickers said. 

"Historians do not normally 
conduct these sorts of big collabo-
rative projects that scientists do, 
so we don't get the funding," 
Vickers said. "Historians more 
commonly work by themselves."

Regents approve fourth 
year of tuition increases 
Budget also cuts percentage of fees 

returned to pay for financial aid 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

News Editor 

Under a $2.8 billion budget 
plan for 2005-06, the UC Board of 
Regents approved a fourth year of 
fee hikes, voting in favor of an 8-
percent increase for undergraduate 
in-state tuition and a 10-percent 
increase for graduate students. 

With $457 in additional costs -
bringing the tuition price over a full 
academic year to $6,145 - the uni-
versity will charge undergraduate 
students almost 60 percent more 
than it did in 2001-02. 

Out-of-state students will see an 
increase of 5 percent next year. 

"We definitely have a budget 
problem if it include raisi ng fees, 
period," UC Student Association 
President Jennifer Lilla said, 
addressing the regents. "We recog-
nize that you did not come to this 
point by choice, but you do have 
the choice today to draw the line." 

UC President Robert C. Dynes 
and Vice President for Budget 
Larry Hershman told the board 
that the increases were mandated 
by a compact the university signed 

with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and would continue to help the 
university offset nearly $500 mil-
lion in state cuts in recent years. 

"This is not a budget that 
accomplishes everything we would 
like to, all at once," Dynes said. "In 
this first year of the compact, we 
will largely be regaining our foot-
ing from the cuts of the last several 
years, not taking step forward.' 

Since the 1970s, the univer ity's 
share of the state general fund has 
fallen from 7 percent to 3.5 percent. 

Only Student Regent Jodi L. 
Anderson voted against the propos-
al - which passed 13 - 1 - while 
Regent David S. Lee ab tained. 

With the increases, total sys-
temwide fees on U campu es will 
still trail comparable public in titu-
tions by more than $1,000 for 
undergraduates and more than 
$2 ,000 for graduate students, the 
university estimated.

Fox picks vice chancellor 
for stem cell board slot 

Warren defends conference funds 
J-Board decision expected within seven days 

By ALESSANDRA RADlCA1I 
Staff Writer 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
appointed Edward Holmes, vice 
chancellor of health sciences and 
dean of UCSD School of 
Medicine, to an independent 
committee that will oversee 
California's new stem cell research 
institute. 

Proposition 71, which passed in 
the Nov. 2 election, authorized the 
sale of$3 billion in bonds to pay for 
stem cell research. The proposition 
gave Fox - as well as each of the 
four other chancellors at UC cam-
puses with medical centers - the 
right to appoint one member to the 
Independent Citizens Oversight 
Commission created by the ballot 

measure. 
"[The chancellor wanted to) 

identify a leader with a good, broad 
background in life sciences, which 
[Holmes) has," campus health sci-
ences communications director 
Leslie Franz said. "[Holmes is) com-
mitted to multidisciplinary efforts 
[and he is) very well connected." 

Under the proposition, Holmes 
and other members of the commit-
tee will administer the new 
California Institute for 
Regenerative Medicines. 

Members of the ICOC wiU 'reg-
ulate the funds of the institute and 
also create a process by which sci-
entists can apply for grants and 
conduct research , according to 

See HOLMES. Page 3

Earl Warren College 
Freshman Senator Matt Herrick 
and supporters of the Asian and 
Pacific-Islander Student Alliance 
high school conference sparred 
over the interpretation of bylaws 
governing the Warren College 
Student Council at a Nov. 18 
hearing before the Warren 
College Judiciai Board, which 
convened to determine whether 
the council could fund the confer-
ence. 

The WCSC originally decided 
to allocate $150 for the confer-
ence at its Oct. 28 meeting by a 
vote of 10-3. However, a griev-
ance filed by Herrick on Nov. 8 
resulted in a preliminaryinjunc-
tion freezing all WCSC funds for 
the conference, which was held on 
Nov. 13. 

~People have asked me if this 
whole controversy that I've creat-
ed is just a publicity stunt," 
Herrick said during the hearing. 
"My reasons for filing this griev-
ance are selfless and honorable. I 
have taken these actions to pre-
serve the integrity of the Warren 
College Student Council and this 
fight has cost me a great deal per-
sonally." 

Herrick argued that by funding 

the APSA conference, WCSC 
violates its own constitution and 
financial bylaws, enacted this year, 
which state that the council can 
only allocate funds to projects that 
benefit the Warren College com-
munity. In Herrick's opinion, the 
event could not be considered a 
benefit to Warren students. 

"The APSA constitution 
explicitly states that this confer-
ence is to benefit high school stu-
dents by addressing the questions 
and concerns of San Diego youth 
in regards to college, as well as to 

initiate the transition from high 
school to university," Herrick said. 

Warren Student Advocate 
Charlene Cheng, who represented 
WCSC in the case, claimed that 
Herrick based his entire grievance 
on his per onal interpretation of 
the bylaws. 

"In this case, [1 Ierrick) had the 
burden of proof to show that 
WCSC has been in violation of its 
bylaws by funding this high school 
outreach program, and he has

Frye falls behind in write-in 

mayoral vote count 
San Diego City Councilwoman Donna Frye 

has fallen approximately 2,500 votes behind 
in her write-in bid to oust incumbent Mayor 
Dick Murphy, the most recent numbers from 
the San Diego County Registrar of Voters indi-
cate. 

The registrar has verified just over 155,000 
votes for Frye, who tra ils Murphy's approximate 
157,500 votes. 

Though the final results will not be issued 
until Nov. 30, Murphy held a small, unofficial 
victory celebration late last week. 

"I appreciate the work of the Registrar of 
Voters and all the people who participated in 
the election process," Frye stated in a campaign 
message. "It is premature to assume a winner 
in the mayoral election, however, until every 
vote is counted. There is a fundamental right to 
expect that all voters who cast a ballot in this 
election have their vote counted. I remain opti-

misti~ that the will of the people will prevail 
once all the ballots are counted and included in 
the final tally." 

Frye also said she supported a lawsuit by 
the San Diego League of Women Voters, which 
seeks to force the registrar to count several 
thousands ballots on which voters wrote in a 
candidate's name but did not fill in a corre-
sponding ·write-in" bubble. 

A packet sent out to voters before Election 
Day may have confused some voters, as it 
did not mention the need to fill in the bub-
ble, Frye stated. She pointed to the San 
Diego County Municipal Code, which lists no 
requirement for a bubble or other marking to 
be used. 

Several days earlier, Frye survived a sepa-
rate legal challenge, when the federal court 
threw out suits seeking to disqualify her can-
didacy based on the differences in the munic-
ipal code and the city charter for rules gov-
erning write-in candidates. 

Regents expand benefits to

By a unanimous vote, the UC Board of 
Regents approved a proposal meant to 
expand existing tuition and fee waivers to 
domestic partners, a move made necessary 
by state law. 

The plan included amendments to the uni-
versity's Standing Order 110.2, which govems 
matters related to residency and tuition. The 
changes expanded the fee exemption provided 
to spouses of faculty members serving on UC 
Academic Senate to include registered domes-

Researchers sound alarm in 
Florida presidential vote 
A group of UC Berkeley researchers have 

called for an investigation of electronic voting at 
heavily Democratic Florida counties in the Nov. 
2 Fresidential election. The group cited statisti-
ca evidence that showed large discrepancies 
between the shares of the vote received by 
President George W. Bush in counties using 
electronic voting machines and those voting by 
traditional methods. 

The probability that the discrepancies arose 
by chance is less than O. 1 percen~ they said. 

"For the sake of all future elections involving 
elec.tronic voting, someone must investigate 
and explain the statistical anomalies in Rorida: 
UC Berkeley sociology professor Michael Hout 
stated. "We're callin$ on voting officials in 
Florida to take action. 

Statistical regression techniques showed 
that counties using electronic machines posted 
an unexpected gain in votes for Bush, the 
researchers reported. 

However, critics of the statistical report 
have pointed out that the Democratic coun-
ties in question have shown a history of 
unexpectedly strong support for Republican 
incumbents in past elections, media outlets 
reported. 

Scientists find treatment for 
rare fever syndrome 

A team of UCSD scientists has found an 
effective treatment for a condition that caus-
es flu-like symptoms after exposure to cold 
temperatures among a small population of 
people. 

For those afflicted with the ailment, condi-
tions as mild as an air-conditioned room or 
fall breeze can trigger joint pain, rash and 
fever. 

In a study published in the Nov. 13 edition 
of the journal Lancet, researchers said they had 
discovered a protein responsible for the reac-
tion and suggested that drug treatment prior to 
cold exposure could prevent the response by 
the immune system.

Study links language, musical ability 
By WlWAM CHING 

Staff Writer 

International musical virtuosos 
might have benefited in their cr:aft 
from speaking a foreign language, a 
new study about the nature of musi-
cal ability suggests. 

UCSD psychology professor 
Diana Deutsch discovered a link 
between spealcing a tone language 
and having absolute, or perfect 
pitch - the ability to identify or 
produce the pitch of a tone without 
the convenience of a reference note . 

Identifying a musical note is 
analogous to naming colors. A per-
son can identify an apple as red 
without having to compare it to 
another object, like a banana. In 
music, this is not the case for most 
people, whu are only capable of 
judging pitches in relation to others. 

In tone languages, words take 
on different meanings depending 
on the tone used or how the word 
is enunciated . These include 
Mandarin, Cantonese , Vietnamese 
and Thai, as well as some African 
and South American languages. 
Pitch-accent languages also use 
some tonal differences, like tone 
languages, and include Korean and 
Japanese, according to Deutsch. 

Conversely, in intonation lan-
guages - English, French and 
Spanish, among others - pitch is 
used to emphasize or stress an 
idea, rather than provide meaning. 

Deutsch's study concluded that 
there is a strong possi bili ty that 
spealcing a rone language length-
ens the "critical period," or win-
dow of opportunity, for one to 
acquire language - or in this case, 
perfect pitch - in early infancy 
and likens learning to play an 
instrument to learning the tones 
of a second language. Tone lan-
guage speakers have a relatively 
easier time learning musical pitch-

es compared to speakers of intona-
tion languages, Deutsch found. 

"They acquire tones in their 
tone language, so when they come 
to have music lessons, musical tones 
will then be treated by the brain as 
the acquisition of tones of a differ-
ent tone language," Deutsch said. 

The premiere study compares 
twO different populations on the 
basis of tones and language and 
their effects on musical abilities. 

"It is really interesting that 
Mandarin speakers have a higher 
prevalence of having absolute 
pitch for music compared with 
non tone language speakers," 
Deutsch said. "And it does raise 
the question of what other aspects 
of music might also be enhanced 
by the learning of tone languages 
at an early age. " 

The first group included in the 
study consisted of 88 first-year 
Mandarin-speaking students 
enrolled in the Central 
Conservatory of Music in Beijing, 
China. The second group consist-
ed of 115 first-year students -
none of whom knew a tone lan-
guage or had parents who did -
enrolled in the Eastman School of 
Music in Rochester, N .¥. 

Statistics showed a strong corre-
lation between perfect pitch and the 
onset of musical training in both 
groups. The earlier an individual 
started training, the higher the 
probability that the individual 
would develop perfect pitch, the 
study found . For students who 
began their training between ages 
four and five, approximately 60 per-
cent of Chinese srudents met the 
criteria for perfect pitch, as opposed 
to.14 percent of the American non-
tone language speakers. 

In the music world, several 
issues have surrounded the per-
ceived importance of perfect pitch. 
Although many accomplished 

musicians have been known to 
possess it, incl uding the likes of 
Beethoven, Bach, Chopin and 
Mozart, having perfect pitch is not 
necessarily indicative of one's 
musical abilities, according to 
UCSD music deparunenr systems 
programmer Trevor Henthorn. 

"There have certainly been 
really great composers who do not 
have perfect pitch and there are a 
lot of [people) I know who are just 
horrible musicians, yet they have 
perfect pitch," Henthorn said. 

Henthorn has worked closely 
with Deutsch since 1986 and aided 
Deutsch in designing and creating 
the sounds for the experiment, in 
addition to managing and analyzing 
the huge amount of data collected. 

"The srudy came out a lot bet-
ter than we ever anticipated," 
Henthorn said. "And a lot of fac-
tors that you'd think might factor 
in and could interfere with 

[Deutsch~) end results just didn't 
factor in ." 

The new study piggybacks on 
other research Deutsch conducted 
in 1999. The previous study dis-
covered speakers of tone lan-
guages, particularly Mandarin and 
Vietnamese, were able to pro-
nounce a list of words and respec-
tive pitches consistently. Deutsch 
concluded that this ability resulted 
from their early acquisition of 
tone language. 

Although having perfect pitch 
is considered to be an elltremely 
rare ability - it is estimated that 
less than one in 10,000 possess 
perfect pi tch in the United States 
and Europe - studies suggest that 
many people do, in fact, possess an 
implicit form of absolute pitch 
even though they are unable to 
verbally label the notes.

Law should allow for 
foreign-born presidents 

Amendment, while justifiable, would be 
poorly timed at this divided juncture 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

A dmit it: There's a definite, . glamour-rooted appeal to 
. having the Terminator as 

California's governor. And a 
huge part of Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's celebrity 
appeal comes from (if not the 
biceps) that accent: Ahnold' Cal-
ee-forn-ya' 

After getting off to a some-
what rod.:y start battling 
Californians skeptical of an actor 
leading the Golden State, 
Schwarzenegger has proven him-
self worthy of the task. Now he 
and some of his governmental 
coworkers have begun asking an 
interesting question: Why stop at 
governor? 

Members of the U.S. Senate 
have recently proposed an amend-
ment to the Constitution that 
would allow foreign-born citizens 
to run for president. The 
Governator himself, rumored to 
harbor presidential aspirations, is 
one of the proposal's strongest 
proponents. 

And it's not necessaril y a bad 
idea. rts a pretty good one, actual-
ly - just not yet. 

Remember how many incensed 
protests, speeches and the like 
spawned in the wake of the 2000 
and 2004 elections? And consider 
how many Americans staunchly 
support the war in Iraq , and the 
equal number who oppose it just 
as vehemently. The possibility of 
Americans electing a foreign-born 
president would be met with an 
entire spectrum of reactions; to 
push such a monumental change 
in the Constitution now would 
only further the dichotomy 
between right- and left-wing 
America . 

The proposed amendmenr, 
though it may affect very few 
people, is a radical suggestion and 
challenges one of the longest-
standing statutes of the 
Constitution - so let's not be 
too hasty. Without experi-
ence to cite as evidence. 
there's really no 
clear-cut answer as 
to whether elect-
ing a forei gn-
born president 
would be a 
good idea . 

It's nOt 
difficult to 
imagine 
arguments 
from the 
proposed 
amendment's 
opponents. 

There's always the 
question of mixed inter-
est, of course - how 
would one's loyalty to 
the United States be 
evaluated if one had 

been born in another country? 
(Some have proposed a 35 -year 
residency requirement - a 15-
year increase from the current 
presidenrial requirement - in 
conjunction with an amendment 
allowing non-native presidents). 
What if a foreign-born president 
still had significant familial or 
other connections in his native 
country? Would an individual 
born in a country on hostile terms 
with the United States be allowed 
to run) Would U.S. citizens find it 
difficult to submit to a president 
born elsewhere? 

But on the other hand, it's 
equally possible that placing a 
limit on such an immutable aspect 
of eligibility could be denying the 
United States some highJy quali-
fied candidates. The foreign-born 
segment of the United States is a 
significant portion of the popula-
tion . The most recent U.S. 
Census recorded a foreign-born 
population of J3.5 million, or just 
under 12 percent of U.S. residents 
- that's a large number of 
Americans to deny eligibil ity. 

Qualification is also an issue. 
Schwarzenegger cited Madeleine 
AJbright and Henry Kissinger as 
foreign-born individuals (both 
from Europe) who, as government 
officials made vital contributions 
to the United States. They are not 
alone, of course. Austrian-born· 
Schwarzenegger is no pioneer as a 
governor: California's seventh 
governor, John Downey, was a 
native of Ireland; Illinois and 
Nevada have been led by foreign-

born men as well. If 

Schwarzenegger fulfills his duties 
as governor well enough, it's likely 
that he would make an equally 
competent president if given th~ 
chance. 

And, as the more idealistic 
would argue, America is supposed 
to be the "land of opportunity." 
What good is the title if an immi-
grant is so restricted? 

Theres no way to· say for sure 
yet, but what is certain is that the 
benefits of waiting to make such 
an extreme change to the 
Constitution in favor of unifying 
Americans would far outweigh 
those of electing a foreign-born 
president. 

Obviously, that's not a prece-
dent that can be applied to all 
actions. Slavery would still exist, 
women wouldn't be allowed to 
vote and many forms of abuse 
would still be legal had that been 
our mantra since day one. 

But this is a different case. An 
amendment that would open the 
presidential race to a few more can-
didates, who immigrated despite 
knowledge that they'd need to find 
other ways to serve· their new coun-
try, is an idea odious to some. 
While that would be entirely iITel-
evant in circumstances where the 
rights of some were being infringed 
upon, keeping the Constitution as 
is for the time being is an exercise in 
prudence, not prejudice. 

Perhaps America would benefit 
from a presidential rac~ in which a 
major candidate was born in anoth-
er country. But in the meantime, 
there are a number of highly quali-
fied presidential candidates who 
can run the country, and America 
will benefit most by focusing on 
improving and maintaining unity 
before attempting to revise the 
charter by which it is governed. 

But in four or five more years, 
the proposal should be revisited.

Fears about Bush's 
2nd term overblown 

Cabinet changes will . 
Improve administration 
By ROBIN AVERBECK 

Staff Writer 

Say hello to four more years of 
the Bush administration. Despite 
what the man with the "Support 
the Ohio Recount" signs on the 
back of his pickup thinks, the Bush 
dynasty is here to stay for another 
presidential term - and what 
would another presidential term be 
without some fresh doses of specu-
lation. 

The most entertaining place to 
start would be to examine the fears 
of the far left. As far as they are 
concerned, H alliburton will have 
telescreens in mass production 
within a year and abortion will be 
outlawed . Because Bush is a man 
of faith, he is going to start using 
State of the Union addresses as 
evangelical revivals, and because 
he doesn't have to run for another 
term, he has an excellent opportu-
nity to invade all the Middle 
Eastern countries and complete 

his construction of Bushistan. 
Entertaining) Yes. Realistic? 

No. Yet it is always intriguing to 
see how these ideas permeate, 
across the country and then across 
the ocean. \Vatching French cov-
erage of the election after watch-
ing C-Span was a great way to get 
a feel for the more simplistic 
views of what a second Bush 
administration could mean, and 
all the more amusing since it was 
badly translated. In France, they 
do segments on how Bush is 
skilled at "pretendi ng" to be one 
of the common "hicks" to win 
elections; in America, they attack 
him for really being so. French 
coverage managed to keep from 
sounding desperate, but it painted 
Bush as a man ready. to bring the 
religious crusade home, deter-
mined to convert everyone to his 
wacky form of Christianity. There 
is no mention of the support Bush

A n anonymous autumn Wednesday at 4:51 p.m. The line in front of

toward the trees. At this hour, the

Slowly but surely, 10-,30-,50-,70-
some students pile into the shuttle. 
Everyone squishes in, packed into 
the vehicle like premium Haagen-
Dazs in an airtight carton. Alas, 
someone is running alongside the 
bus after we start pulling out of the 
turnaround. The driver, all person-

friendly . blue "UCSD

brakes for this Forrest Gump. This 
is not unusual, of course. Many a 
time has a driver graciously waited

student, who pants out a breathy 

"Th ... hanks" after the chase. It's

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Bush: President not as concerned with legacy after re,election 
concinued from page 4 

won or his defense of Islam in the 
days immediately following Sept. 
II, or the fact that his faith-based 
initiatives did not make 
Christianity a prerequisite. 

Of course, we can just look to 
what Bush says his priorities are: 
the war on terror, reforming the 
tax code and Social Security. But 
this is not an entirely trustworthy 
predictor either. Of course Bush 
will pursue these things, but what 
that actually means is another 
question. One thing is for sure: 
Bush is definitely comfortable 
with his victory. Sometimes 
politicians seem to start trivial 
fights that really revolve around 
something larger; why the Bush 
team had to come out and use the 
disputed word "mandate" is ques-
tionable, but it sparked several 
days of excruciatingly silly 

debat~s over the meaning of the 
word on all the pundit shows. 

It is interesting to watch the 
ever-so-mild - but still visible-
change in Bush's demeanor since 
his win this November. In his first 
press conference, he was relaxed, 
confident and not afraid to joke 
with the reporters - in a tone 
suggestive of the underlying hos-

",.-. 

tiliry berween him and much of 
the press. He seemed to feel more

doesn't have to 
apologize to any-
one for such tres-
passes anymore. 
With no third 
term in si ght, it's 
safe to say that we 
will be seeing a 
little more of the 
honest Bush per-
sonality, the type 
that doesn't trip 
on his words as 
often, because 
they were not pre-
conceived by 
some outside 
brain. 

And beyond 
the man himself, 
there is his new 
and improved cab-

be the first Latino 
attorney general 
of the United 
States. Whether 
his other policies 
will be any less 
troubling than 
Ashcroft's remains 
to be seen. 

And who can 
forget our new 
secretary of state, 
Condoleeza Rice? 
Apparently when 
Democrats 
appoint minorities 
and women to 
high positions it 
reflects their pro-
gressive natures, 
but when 
Republicans do it 
their appointees 
are deemed 
unqualified. But 

inet. Anyone besides John 
Ashcroft would have been more 
appealing and less offensive, and 
what's more, he's being replaced 
by Alberto Gonzales, a man whose 

bringing out that 
charge is one of the easiest things 
for critics to do, and dOesn't really 
stick if you actually try to apply it 
fairly to all the incredible and tal-
ented leaders throughout history 

who could now easily be attacked 
for having been "unqualified." 
Besides being an excellent choice 
on her pre-White House creden-
tials alone, Rice's contact with the 
entire Bush cabinet for four years 
can hardly be discounted when 
trying to find someone "experi-
enced." 

Yet 'second terms can be per-
ilous things, no matter who you 
have riding along with you. If 
Bush were concerned about his 
legacy, he would stick to domestic 
issues that aren't too controver-
sial and try to handle the situation 
in Iraq without making any dras-
tic moves. While there is almost 
no sense in believing that Rot v. 
HiJdt is in any serious danger of 
being overturned or that Bush is 
going to try to turn all of America 
into Jesusland, it is evident that 
steering clear of controversy is 
not Bush's style, and we can prob-
ably expect our share of new 
"outrages" that will have the Bush 
lovers and the Bush haters facing 
off. As Bill Clinton opens his new 
library this week, he worries 

' about his legacy. As Bush faces his 
new term, he might just laugh in 
the face of those who tell him to 
do the same.

only "a tiny portion" of its money 
from the university, Berg said. 

APSA: Senator argues money 
viol~tes new council bylaws 

As a resul t of the university's 
inability to provide complete fund-
ing for graduate programs, graduate 
studenr admissions will m05t likely 
decrease in the future, Berg said. 

"The talent pool is staggering, 
[but) that's not the problem," Berg 
said. "We just don't have the fund-
ing." 

Because campus departments 
want to recrwt the very best grad-
uate studenrs, they still must offer 
competitive packages, though 
fewer in number, Vickers said. 

"The entire graduate funding 
issue is moving in the direction of 
crisis," Vickers said. "The size of 
the grant that we're given as a 
department is basically not large 
enough to allow us to give fellow-
ship and teaching assistant pack-
ages that can compete with other 
universities. As a result, we have to 
carve the amount of money that we 
have into fewer and larger units." 

In addition, students in closely 
related but different departments 
can potentially take the same class-
es and join the same labs while 
being paid differently, GSA Vice 
President of Internal Affairs Jeff 
Gold said. . .. 

The disparity of funding and 
graduate student pay is closely 
linked with the department's prac-
tical application and its research 
methods, according to biology 
graduate student Susy McKay. 

"Biology typically brjngs in a 
lot of grant money, whereas some-
thing like math wouldn't be as 
heavily fu ~ed by outside 
sources," McK"y stated in an e-
mail. "Cellular and molecular 
biology are more heavily funded 
because many of the projects have

While fields like those in the 
neuroscience department cover 
tuition and fees and provide a 
stipend for graduate students, the 
same is not true for other areas of 
study, especially those in social 
sciences, Gold said. 

"In the neuroscience depart-

in such fields as history are needed 
and those who find work are paid 
less than science departments, most 
graduate students in these depart-
ments . tum to reaching assistant 
p05itions for funding, Vickers said. 

"[History graduate students) 
certainly have to do more teaching 
assisting than people in the sci-
ences do," Vickers said. "History 
students regard their work as 
teaching assistants to be burden-
some, there's no doubt about that. 

It seriously slows them down." 
Admission of international 

graduate students may also fall in 
the future due to the lack of fund-
ing, sociology department chair 
Andrew Scull said. 

While the UCSD Office of 
Graduate Studies and Research 
offers financial aid through fellow-
ships, scholarships and fee waivers, 
most of these are not offered to 
international students. In addition, 
many of these fellowships, includ-
ing those from the National 
Science Foundation, are offered to 
students in the science field . 

The increasing reliance on 
private, external sources of fund-
ing may have an impact on public 
educational priorities in the 
furore, Kohler said. 

"I think that the state has to 
fully fund public higher educa-
tion," Kohler said. "They have to 
restore the word 'public' to higher 
education. "

simply not been able to prove his 
case," Cheng said during the hear-
ing. "The only thing [he) has been 
able to show is that there are differ-
ent ways to interpret the bylaws, 
and in the case of the funding of 
APSA, the majority ofWCSC vot-
ing members did not believe the 
bylaws were broken." 

According to APSA President 
Victor Huynh, nine out of 20 
APSA executive board members 
are Warren students, about half of 
the committee members for the 
high school conference this year 
came from the college, and approx-
imately 50 to 60 volunteers at the 
event were from Warren. 

For the past five years, at least 
one of the coordinators of the con-
ference was a Warren student, 
according . to APSA Outreach 
Coordinator Mizuki Okamura . . 

"I'm not going to argue the fact 
that there is a so-and-so number of 
students involved in this organiza-
tion, because these facts are moot 
and irrelevant," Herrick said. 
"Sadly, this was the reason why 
many council members voted for 
funding this [event) ." 

The WCSC financial bylaws do 
not specify any number of Warren 
students that must benefit from an 
event in order for it to receive 
funding, according to testimony 
given by Warren Sophomore 
Senator Greg Murphy. 

Warren Junior Senator Josh 
Martino also said he did not believe 
that the bylaws had been violated. 

"You sort of have to look at two 
things when you're funding," 
Martino said. "You have to look at 
how many students it affects, and to 
what capacity it affects those stu-
dents. This is one of those pro-
grams where, regardless of how 

many students it affects, the 
Warren srudents it does affect have 
tremendous benefits." 

Although Herrick admitted that 
Warren students could and did vol-
unreer at the APSA conference, he 
argued that the bylaws did not per-
mit the funding of service events. 

"Volunteering is also known as 
volunteering service," Herrick said. 
"The bylaws state that the WCSC 
cannot allocate funds for the pur-
poses of services providcd by any 
members of a club. Volunteering 
service is the on ly way tha t students 
could involve themselves in this 
event, and to allocate moncy for 
that purpose is in violation of our 
bylaws." 

According to Huynh, APSi\ 
requested the same amounr of 
money from all six college councils. 
and all of the councils voted to fund 
this year's conference to some 
degree. The total cost of the con-
ference is roughly $6,000 to $8,000 
each year, with the majority of the 
money funded by the Student-
Initiated Outreach Recruitment 
Commission, Huynh said. 

"We believe very strongly about 
outreach, and this event does have 
a good cause behind it," Huynh 
said. "It definitely benefits the 
Warren community." 

In response to the issue, the 
Revelle College Council submitted 
and passed a resolution on Nov. 16 
affirming its support of outreach 
funding. RCC has al'!Vays approved 
funding for APSA's high school 
conference, according to Revelle 
Senior Senator Ted McCombs, 
who drafted the original resolution. 

"I was rather upset over what 
happened at the WCSC and the 
freezing of the APSA funding, and

Hearing: Councils at all

I wanted the RCC to talee a leader-
ship position in affinning its com-
mitment to student-initiated out-
reach," McCombs said. 

Herrick said he felt the resolu-
tion was inappropriate at the time. 

"I feel that because [this) is now 
being considered by the Warren 
Council Judicial Board, it's an 
internal matter,n Herrick said. "I 
just don't think that Revelle 
College knew all of the facts before 
they offered and passed this resol u-
tion.n . 

Members of the A.S. Council 
also passed an emergency appropri-

ation on Nov. 17, covering the 
funds frozen by the Warren Judicial 
Board for the duration of the adju-
dication process. 

Herrick said he has also faced 
several acts of personal antagonism 
since he filed the grievance. His 
door lock was super-glued and his 
face was super-imposed on a lewd 
photo that was posted in the resi-
dence halls, he said. 

The final decision on the case 
will be announced within so:ven 
days of the hearing.

Fees: Students remove shirts 
in protest of regents' vote 

contillut!d from page I 
allocated only 25 percent of new fees 
toward aid for low-income students, 
down from the board~ standing one-
third return-ta-aid ratio. 

Under the governor!; compact, 
only 20 percent oflast year's increas-
es went to pay for financial aid. 

Dynes and Hershman said the 
lower aid return would provide 
enough funds to offset higher fees 
for poor students and also allow the 
university to provide pay increases 
for the first time in several years. 

Faculty will see their salaries rise 
by 3 percent - still approximately 
9 percent below the national aver-
age, Hershman said, while staff 
members will receive an increase of 
2.5 percent, matching inflation. 

"Part of this is an equity issue," 
Hershman said. "We're trying to 
deal with salaries, we're trying to 
deal with maintenance of buildings 
that we're building, and we're try-
ing to deal with improving instruc-
tional program [and] accommodat-
ing enrollment . ... We felt like we'd 
try to be fair to everybody in this 
and have a balanced approach.n 

Though the state budget may 
have tied the board's hands on fees, 
Anderson said the regents simply 
should not raise the work and loan 
burden by reducing the amount of 
new fees going toward aid. 

"It is so critical that we stay 
committed to financial aid, and this 
is something we have the power to 
do,n Anderson said. "I hope when 
some individuals are really looking 
back at this period in UC history, 
that they really see that we did what 
we could to be committed to acces- ' 
sibility and affordability." 

A combination of UC aid and 
state monc::y in the form of Cal 
Grants will make up almost 50 
percent of the fees collected by 
the university under the budget, 
Hershman said, which is enough 
to take "care of all students who 
are needy and are eligible for 
need-based aid.' 

Regent Norman J . Pattiz, how-
ever, said he remained skeptical 
that the extra $6 million needed to 
keep the retum-to-aid ratio at 33 
percent could not be added. 

"When we're talking about a 
$250 million shortfall, I understand 
that's a gargantuan task - a very 
big mountain to climb," Pattiz said. 
"But there isn't any place in the 
University of California system 
where we can't find that 56 million 
dollars to solve this problem?" 

Professional fees to include IRIPS 
In addition to regular tuition, 

the regents also approved a 3-per-
cent increase to the extra fees 
charged by the university's profes-
sional ~ools, including UCSD's 
schools of pharmacy and medicine. 

"I think what we're doing on 
student fees in the professional 
school area is [going) from very low 
fees to being about average," 
Hershman said. 

Though previously covered 
only by graduate tuition, the board 

, , .. i , • f , . .. , 

also extended the S4,OOO profes-
sional fees to master's degree pro-
grams in public policy and Pacific 

internation~1 affairs. The increase 
will include UCSD's Graduate 
School of International Relations 
and Pacioc Studies. 

"We have always enjoyed a rela-
tively inexpensive tuition for our 
students compared to other major 
schools of international affairs, and 
even after these increases, [the I 
costs are much lower than any of 
the other competing institutions,n 
IRIPS Dean Peter F. Cowhey said. 

The new fees, which will be 
instituted gradually for current stu-
dents - who will pay $2,500 more 
next year - will fund services in the 
areas of career placemenr and spe-
cialized courses that "students want 
and need," according to Cowhey. 

"As discussions over possible 
tuition increases have gOl)e over 
the past year, we've kept our stu-
dents infonned of developments 
and we gave our currenr students a 
pledge that any fee increases would 
be graduated," he said. "We will 
honor that promise." 

The budget also asked the 
regents to delegate to Dynes. the 
authority to raise professional fees 
by an additional 15 percenr during 
the course of the year, though that 
provision was removed after sever-
al board members voiced concerns. 

Last year, Dynes received power 
to raise these fees by 10 percent. 

Students shed clothes in protest 
Student audience memberS at the 

meeting took off thcir shirts to sug-
gest that fee hikes and financial aid 
cuts would take the shirts off their 
backs, as part of a protest against 
higher fees organized by the UCSA. 

"We, as students, have nothing 
left to give you but the shirts off 
our backs, because that's all you 
leave us with," A.S. Commissioner 
of Diversity Affairs Christopher 
Sweeten said to the regents, miss-
ing an exam to attend the Nov. l!l 
meeting at UCLA. 

In addition to Sweeten, A.S. 
President Jenn Pae and Vice 
Pfesident External Rigo Marquez 
spoke to the regents during public 
input, expressing their opposition 
to the budget plan. 

As a low-income student who 
depended on financial aid to reduce 
her debt, Pae said she urged the 
regents to reconsider raising fees 
and decreasing aid. 

"You stand here and say that this 
university has quality?n Sweeten 
said. "Quality is sitting right here 
but quality is aoout to leave, 
because quality can no longer 
afford to be here." 

Sweeten told the regents that he 
was forced to work three jobs to 
pay for his education. 

"Watch right now as quality 
walles out of the door," he said, as 
the board's secretary told Sweeten 
that his input period had ended.

I f you are planning a trip to Italy, there is an island off the southern tip of the boot that 
is worth exploring. Sicily, the 
"mysterious island," is best mown 
for its excellent cuisine, fine 
wines, rustic scenery and white-
sand beaches. Its unique culture 
has been influenced over the cen-
turies by the Carthaginians, 
Greek:s and Romans, each of 
whom have left behind a number 
of well-preserved ruins. Mt. Etna, 
the largest active volcano in 
Europe, also attracts visitors who 
attempt to scale its rocky face. 

Ortigia 
Located on the southeastern 

tip of Sicily, the tiny island of 
Ortigia juts out into the Ionian 
Sea, separated from the town of 
Siracusa by a narrow strip of 
water. Ortigia is the oldest part of 
Siracusa and is hOl)le to a Greek 
temple to Apollo and a Greek 
ampbitheate r that can be visited 
as part of a day trip. 

During the summer months, 
residents escape Ortigia for the 
week:end to bathe in the cool 
waters of the Ionian. Popular day-
time activities include exploring 
nearby islands by ferry (one euro), 
participating in water sports, hik-
ing or simply lounging on the 
beach playing scopa (a popular 
Sicilian card game). 

There are enough attractions 
within the town of Ortigia to fill 
up at least two days of ightseeing. 
P"'~a Archimede is a circular 
court of cafes and there is a par-
ticular marzipan shop on the cor-
ner that's worth checking out. Via

Piazza Arc.himede to the sea and 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN FEAlURES 11 

Destination: Sicily, Italy 
offers a convenient medium for 
exploring the town and the many 
shops that dot the avenues. The 
Neapolis Archaeological Park: 
boasts the Greek: amphitheater, 
the Greek: Theater and the myste-
rious Ear of Dionysus (Orecchio 
di Dionigi), a cave where 
Athenian prisioners were once 
held. Caravaggio, a famous 16th 
century Italian painter was among 
those held prisoner There are also 
a number of museums and cathe-
drals worth visiting, such as the 
archaeological museum and the 
Santa Maria della Lacrime. 

At night, the city becomes a 
bustling mix as sunbathers return 
from the beach to experience a bit 
of Qrtigia's night life. There are 
cobblestone waUcways around the 
entire island where fishermen cast 
by day and couples stroll by 
moonlight. The island is not very 
big - you could easily walL: 
around the entire perimeter in 
half an hour. 

Around 9 p.m., nightowls will 
usually chat it up at a cafe while 
enjoying some fine Sicilian cui-
sme. The Gran Caffe Del Duomo 
is one of the more popular cafes 
and sits right across from the 
Duomo in Ortigia. It offers savory 
pizza and pasta at reasonable 
prices. Piazza del Duomo is the 
center for most of the city's night-
time activities. 

Bed and breakfasts provide 
comfortable and fairly inexpen-
sive accommodations for the 
wea ry traveler. The Hotel 
Gutowski al Lungomare di 
Levante is an excellent place to 
bed down for a few nights. Don't 
be scared off by the name - it 
promises a beautiful view of the 
Ionian Sea, an authentic Italian 
breakfast, air-conditioning, 
Internet and hot water.

Duomo di 0rtipI: Located on the island of Ortigia, Sicily, this ancient cathedral is just one of its many exciting attractions. 

Meals are a big event anywhere 
in Italy. Old friends greet one 
another with a kiss on each cheek 
and prepare to enjoy three hours 
of loud eonvj!rsations, a lavish 
five -course meal and plenty of 
vino. In Sicily, the five-course 
meal is ubiquitous. All the food is 
fresh and simple and has amazing 
flavor. 

Waiters serve the antipasti 
first, which consi ts of spicy pep-
pers, cheese, bread, eggplant and 
olives. Then a variety of pastas are 
served, pasta normale being a typ-
ical Sicilian dish. The third course 
is usually either veal or chicken 

with potato, and insa lata mista to 
help cleanse your palate. Room 
for dessert? Sometimes they're 
merciful and provide only a mace-
donia, or fruit bowl. But most 
other times they serve a whole 
Cannollo, a fabulous cheese-filled 
pastry. As long as there's plenty of 
wine to wash everything down -
which there always it - keeping 
up with a hefty Sicilian appetite is 
possible. 

Other sites of interest 
Sicily's uniqueness lies mainly 

in the diversity of its village life. 
The buildings in the southeastern 

town of oro, for example, were 
reconstructed in the baroque style 
after an earthquake in 1693. The 
tiled roof houses, baroque-style 
churches and palaces wirh 
wrought-iron balconies are 
unique to oto and offer colorful 
vistas. 

Taormina, located on rhe 
northeastern side of Sici ly and 
three hours north of Siracusa, is a 
picturesque coastal town. A bus 
must be taken to get to the town, 
which affords stunning ocean 
views over dramatic cliffs.

I f you are planning a trip to Italy, there is an island off the southern tip of the boot that 
is worth exploring. Sicily, the 
"mysterious island," is best knowrr 
for its exc,ellent cuisine, .fine 
wines, rustic scenery and white-
sand beaches. Its unique culture 
has been influenced over the cen-
turies by the Carthaginians, 
Greeles and Romans, each of 
whom have left behind a number 
of well-preserved ruins. Mt. Etna. 
the largest active volcano in 
Europe, also attracts visitors who 
attempt to scale its rocky face. 

Qrtigia 
Located on the southeastern 

tip of Sicily, the tiny island of 
Ortigia juts out into the Ionian 
Sea, separated from the town of 
Siracusa by a narrow strip of 
water. Ortigia is the oldest part of 
Siracusa and is hOf)1e to a Greek 
temple to Apollo and a Greek 
amphitheater that can be visited 
as part of a day trip. 

During the summer months, 
residents e cape Ortigia for the 
weekend to bathe in the cool 
waters of the Ionian. Popular day-
time activities include exploring 
nearby islands by ferry (one euro), 
participating in water sports, hik-
ing or simply lounging on the 
beach playing scopa (a popular 
Sicilian card gamc). 

There are enough attractions 
within the town of Ortigia to fiJI 
up at least two days of sightseeing. 

P'ia~ Archimede is a circular 
court of cafes and there is a p3r-
ticular marzipan shop on the cur-
ncr that's worth checking out. Via 
delle Maestranze stretches from 
Piazza Arc.himede to the sea and

Athenian prisioners were once 
held. Caravaggio, a famous 16th

Contributing Writer 

In the midst of midterm season, 
finding employment with a flexible 
schedule and high pay can be diffi-
cult and stressful for a college stu-
dent. Students simply do not have 
the time or energy this late in the 
game to sift through job posting 
boards in hopes of picking out that 
perfect job. Luckily, there is still 
work out there for students. One· 
just has to know where to look. 

One option that has become 
popular among students for its 
scheduling flexibility and high 
salary is catering. Once hired, 
workers simply accept or decline e-
mails or phone calls from the staff 
coordinator and create their own 
full- or part-time schedule. Revelle 
senior 'Chris Geissinger, has been 
employed at Metro Goumlet 
Catering for six months. 

"It's a great experience," he said. 
"I work at awesome houses, and the 
pay is good." 

Geissinger earns $15 per hour 
plus occasional tips by serving and 
bussing at cocktail and dinner par-
ties. He sets his own hours. choos-
ing to work one party every two 
weeks. 

"I found out about Metro 
Gourmet at the Career Services job 
listing board," Geissinger said. For 
more information about Metro 
Gourmet, visit bttp:ll1uww.metro-
gourmeti1Zc.cO'm. 

For students who are looking 
for a quick, easy way to make some 
extra money and have fun, 
Leapfrog Innovations is another 
option. Based in Massach usetts, 
Leapfrog is hired by corporate 
businesses all over the country, such 
as Microsoft and Cisco Systems, 

that are looking for help in devel-
oping team-building skills. The job 
guarantees excitement, advertising 
the encouraging slogan, "The 
Company that Laughs and Lasts!" 

According to Andy Cheng, 
director of corporate and program 
operations, the staff consists of a 
core group of facilitators who trav-

dents for walk-in and scheduled 
appointments. According to 
Schmidt, there are many jobs avail-
able that specifically fit the needs of 
a busy college student looking for a 
high-paying, easy-going position. 

"We often list tutoring jobs in 
many subjects that are very flexible 
in terms of hours and typically pay 
$8 to $10 per hour," Sclunidt said. 

Schmidt also mentioned after-
"We're looking for energetic school program leader positions,

According to Cheng, depending 
on when the company is in San 
Diego, students cOlrunit to working 
one day interacting with clients and 
helping to build team development 
skills and projects, earning $100 for 
a day's work. To find out more, stu-
dents can explore the Web site at

These jobs were originally post-
ed on the Career Services Center 
Web site. bttp:llcllrur.ucsd.edu, a 
wonderful resource and smart start-
ing place for students in search of 
the perfect job. 

Craig Schmidt, associate direc-
tor of Career Services, is one of 

which could be advantageous for 
students interested in education, 
recreation or social services. 

In-home services also have flex-
ible hours and pay SIO-plus per 
hour; product demonstrators are 
paid close to SIS per hour; and 
campus representatives for major 
corporations are paid well, wi th 
flexible hours. 

Above all, Schmidt emphasizes 
the importance of Career Portfolio, 
a new online service which allows 
students to store resumes, writing 
samples, course lists and slcill sets, 
which can then be reviewed by 
prospective employers. PorrTriton, 
another CSC service, lists job and 
internship openings. 

"Students should be encouraged 
to check our Port Triton job portal 
to find job listings targeted at 
UCSD students, both on and off 
campus," Schmidt said.

Sicily: Ruins, 
beaches found 
in Taormina 

~ 
HAppy 20th BIRTHDAY 

coruin~d from page J J 
Taormina has plenty of cute shops 
and outdoor cafes. There is an old 
amphitheater, and if you take the 
bus back down, there are beauti-
ful, clean beaches. 

Depending on how long 
you're planning on staying in 
Sicily, you're going to want to 
budget your money accordingly. 
Keep in mind the euro is worth 
more than the American dollar, 
but you can monitor the exchange 
rates at wW1JI.x-ratts.com. Drinks 
cost anywhere from 5 to 10 euros, 
and taxis or ferries are the best 
way to get from place to place. 

Restaurant meals can be 
expensive - anywhere from 10 to 
20 euros per person, and keep in 
mind you have to pay for the 
water. Buying cheap 1.S0-euro 
pannini from tabacci (bars) is 
advisable. But experience at least 
one great meal. And whatever you 
do, make sure you float in the 
Ionian Sea - the feeling is price-
less.

Competing at the first 
Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association English Competition, 
hosted by the University of San 
Diego at Sweetwater farms in 
Bonita, Calif., the UCSD equestri-
an team placed third under the 
Toreros and Cal Poly Pomona on 
Nov. 20. Senior Kayti Mathewson 
placed first in the intermediate flat 
class, and senior Katy Wanner took 
first in the walk/trot class. 

Even though no English rider 
pointed out, or gained enough 
points to move up into the next 
class, the team was optimistic. 

"We were phenomenal," senior 
captain Kate McComas said. 
"Everyone placed and rode better 
than I've ever seen them ride." 

Besides being the first English 
competition of the season, it w·as 
also the first competition for fresh-
man riders Mae Chase-Dunn and 
Mckell Gregory. 

"I placed last or second-to-Iast 
place, but it was definitely a learn-
ing experience," Chase-Dunn said. 

Chase-Dunn, a veteran rider 
since childhood, has never compet-
ed before. 

"I will learn to figure out the 
drill [of competitions)," Chase-
Dunn said. "It went fine; ] didn't 
really Ju:1ow what was expected, 
but I definitely know what areas I 
need to practice more." 

Gregory, another rookie to 
competitions, first showed a 

friend's horse this summer. 
"IHSA is much different 

because it's not on a horse you 
know," Gregoty said. 

Gregory is looking forward to 
moving up from the walk/rror class, 
in which she placed fourth at the 
Nov. 20 competition. 

"I want to keep showing and 
gaining points," Gregory said. 
"Hopefully I'll move up and get to 
practice what I've been working on 
in lessons." 

The equestrian team also com-
petes in Western-style competitions, 
placing third on Oct. 16 and first on 
Nov. 6, to rank No.2 in the region. 

At the Nov. 6 competition, 
McComas placed first and pointed 
out (scored enough points to 
advance to the next level) in the 
advanced horsemanship class and is 
currendy leading the region in her 
class. Sophomore Lindsey Minor 
crushed the competition and 
placed first, pointing out of both 
open horsemanship and open rein-
ing classes. She also won the High-
Point Western Rider honor. Minor 
already qualified for Regionals in 
the advanced horsemanship at the 
Oct. 16 Western competition. 
Senior Katherine Shafer placed 
second in the intermediate-I horse-
manship class while senior Mark 
Chaussee, the only male on the 
team, also placed second in the 
walk/jog class. 

The Tritons will host an 
English competition on Dec. 4 and 
Dec. S at the Ridgemar Equestrian 
Center in Del Mar, Calif.

Volleyball: CSUSB comes back from 2 .. 0 hole 
continued fram ptrge 20 

team tried as hard as they could 
and got close to winning but just 
did not have much left. " 

Harris played the best match of 
her career, setting a school record 
with 45 kills to hit .320, while 
adding 15 digs defensively. Right 
behind her was the Coyotes' 
Cathleen Price, who had 27 Wls, 
18 digs and 7 blocks against 
UCSD. ./ 

For the Tritons, freshman 
libero Natalie Facchini also set a 
school record with 40 digs, while 
senior -outside hitter Bonnie 
Wilson posted 22 kills, also set-
ting a school record for most kills 
in a season, with 439. Senior 
middle blockers Katie Hogan 
and Kendra Canape posted 15 
and 10 kills, respectively. Canape 
also had 10 blocks in the m~tch. 
Dunsmore tallied 14 kills and 19 
digs; her 14 kills shattered the 
UCSD all-time record for kills, 
placing her atop the list with 
1,182 career kills. Crandell also 
tallied 10 kills and seven digs, 
while senior setter Teresa Ohta 
guided the Triton offense with 58 
assists. 

In the Pacific Regional semi-
finals the night before, the 
Tritons overcame a 2-1 deficit to 
send Hawaii Pacific packing. The 
Sea Warriors had been a solid 
hitting and blocking team 
throughout the season, and the 
Tritons knew they would have to 
overcome Hawaii Pacific's size. 
After the Sea Warriors won game 
one decisively, 30-19, the Tritons 
retaliated by wking game two, 
30-26, with Canape and Crandell 
teaming up for the game-win-
ning block. Game three saw the 
Sea Warriors running out to an 
early lead that they clung to for 
the 30-23 win. 

Refusing to let the match come 
to a close, UCSD deadlocked 
game four at 13-13. Both teams 
traded points to remain tied 
throughout the rest of the game, 
until the Tritons closed it out 30-
28 on Canape's kill to force the 
decisive game five. Game five 
belonged to UCSD, who battled 
to a 15-11 win clinched by 
Crandell, avenging last season's 
loss to Hawaii Paci6c. 

Five UCSD players recorded 
kills in double digits, with Wilson 
and Dunsmore posting double-

doubles (kills and digs) to lead the 
way. Wilson had 18 kills and 16 
digs while Dunsmore tallied 16 
kills and 10 digs. Ohta paced the 
Tritons with 64 assists and added 
nine digs and four block assists. 
Facchini led both teams defensive-
ly with 23 digs while Crandell (15 
kills), Canape (14 kills) and Hogan 
(II Icills) chipped in offensively. 

Unforrunately for the Tritons, 
the euphoria of the huge victory 
did not last very long. 

"After the win, I sent a quick 
message to the team that it was 
such a fabulous win and I was 
proud of them," McFarland said. 
"But we had San Bernardino 
looming and we had to get ready. 
It was unfortunate that [Hawaii 
Pacific) was a win that we couldn't 
savor." 

UCSD faced Cal State 
Bakers6eld in the first round of the 
Pacific Regionals and swept the 
Roadrunners, 33-31, 30-16, 30-24, 

" They're the greatest, and 
llove them, They're a 

tremendous team, and the 
seniors have achieved so 

much in their four 
seasons." 

- Duncan McFIItIncI. UCSD 
women's wIeybaII held coach 

0)1 Nov. 18 at RIMAC Arena. 
Canape led the charge with 15 kiDs 
and only one error to hit .667, while 
Dunsmore had 13 kills, including 
eight in the tighdy contested game 
one. Ohta distributed 40 assists 
while Wilson recorded double dig-
its in kil1s (11) and digs (13). Once 
again, Facchini had a solid night, 
posting a match-high 16 digs. 

"I felt pretty good," Dunsmore 
said. "We were all pretty fired up 
and came out with an extra spark 
in our eye because it was the 
Regional tournament and we've 
been waiting for this for a long 
time. so 1 think all of us were real-
ly excited and ready to play." 

Although the Roadrunners 
were a much smaller team than 
the Tritons, they moved quickly 

and put pressure on UCSD in 
game one to set themselves up to 
clinch it at 29-28. However, 
Wilson put away a cross-court kill 
to tie it up at 29-29, and play 
remained tied at 31-31 until a 
Hogan tip and Dunsmore's eighth 
kill gave the Tritons game one, 
H -3\. 

After UCSD made some block-
ing adjustments, it secured an early 
lead that Cal State Bakersfield 
could not break through. The 
Tritons outhit the Roadrunners 
.412 to .070 in game two. 

uI think I calmed down a little 
more in the second and third 
game," said Canape, who posted 
6ve kills in game two. "I got a lit-
de fired up to start if off, my 
adrenaline just always rushing a 
lot. Like Stacy said before, I've 
been anxious all week. We've been 
waiting for playoffs since the 
beginning of the season ... and it's 
6nally here today. Its such a rush. " 

Game three saw UCSD settle 
into a huge 21-10 lead. but Cal 
State Bakersfield slowly climbed its 
way to trail 25-22. However, the 
Tritons continued to hit and blOCK 
berter, with Canape and Dunsmore 
putting forth clutch performances, 
combining to score the 6ve points 
UCSD needed to win game three 
and the match, 30-24. 

"They're a great team," 
Roadrunner head coach John Price 
said of the Tritons. "We had to play 
great and put some pressure on 
them and we did that in game one. 
But once [the Tritons) got off the 
hoolc, they recovered and we could-
n't keep the pressure on them. 
Ohtas great; shes the best player in 
the country and she really kills us." 

At the conclusion of the 
Regionals, Ohta, Wilson, Canape 
and Facchini were selected to the 
12-player NCAA Pacific Regional 
All-Tournament T earn for their 
perfonnance in the postseason. 

Although UCSD saw its 
national tide hopes come to an 
early ending, McFarland was 
proud of his team's overall efforts 
this season. 

"They're the greatest, and I love 
them," he said. "They're a tremen-
dous team, and the seniors have 
achieved so much in their four sea-
sons. As freshmen, they made it to 
the Elite Eight and the semifinals ... 
and they had so many signi6cant 
wins [thereafter)."

Volleyball upset by Coyotes 
Season ends in five-set comeback heartbreaker 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

The No. 2 UCSD women's 
volleyball team ran up against a 
red-hot Cal State San Bernadino 
squad that staged a comeback 
against the Tritons, dashing their 
national title hopes in a heart-
breaking upset (30-27, 30-26, 29-
31,31-33, IS-17) on Nov. 20 in 
the NCAA Pacific Regional Finals 
at RIMAC Arena. 

"It h:nrts me to think about 
[the loss] because I can stay and 
coach and have another chance [at 
a title], but for the seniors, they 
don't have that chance," Triton 
head coach Duncan McFarland 
said. "And 1 think they deserve it 
because they earned it with 30 
wins." 

This defeat carne the day after 
the Tritons avenged last year's 
Pacific Regional loss to Hawaii 
Pacific. The painful memory 
remained with the Tritons, who 
refused to repeat history in their 
emotional, come-from-behind, 
five-set victory (19-30, 30-26, 23-
30, 30-28, IS-I I) against the Sea 
Warriors on Nov. 19 in the emifi-
nal . 

Although UCSD had beaten 
Cal State San Bernardino twice 
during the regular season, the 
Tritons were unable to close out 
the crucial game three that would 
have clinched the match . 

The Tritons mounted late 
coring run in games one and 

two to ecure wins at 30-27 and 
30-24, respectively. However, in 
game three, the Coyotes refused 
to be swept and at 29-29, Cal 
State San Bernardino's Brianna 
Harris came up with two points to 
save the game and extend her 
team's playoff hopes, 31-29. 

Senior outside hitter Stacy 
Dunsmore notched a kill to give 
UCSD a chance to dose out the 
match with a 30-29 edge in game 
four, but Cal State San 
Bernardino stepped up and came 
back again, winning 33-3\ to 
force a fifth, tiebreaking set. 

AndreW Mo/Guardian 
Catalyst: Senior setter and UCSD all-time assists leader Teresa Ohta (center) 
distributed 58 assists in the Tritons' loss to Cal State San Bernardino on Nov. 20. 

Wanting desperately to stave 
off the Coyotes, the Tritons 
jumped to an early lead and junior 
olltside hitter Lindsay Crandell 
gave the Tritons match point at 
14-12. Undeterred, Cal State San 
Bernardino rallied to tie it at 14-
14, and Crandell once again gave 
UCSD a IS-14 edge. The Tritons 
could not stop Harris, who nailed 
two ki lis to finish ga me five, 17-
IS, sending the Coyotes to the 
Elite Eight. 

"There were two big factors to 
the match," McFarland said. "It 

was a tremendous match that San 
Bernardino played, much better 
than the matches they played 
before. Brianna Harris was unbe-
lievable; she always played very 
well against us, and she just did 
significantly better. The other 
factor is that we expended so 
much physical and emotional 
effort the night before against 
Hawaii Pacific, and we were very 
willing to give 100 percent 
[against San Bernardino]. The

Tritons fall to Redlands in 
double--overtime thriller 

Men's water polo goes 2-1 for third 
at WWPA Championships 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

The No. 10 Triton men's water 
polo team lost a double-overtime 
6-5 decision to Redlands in the 
second of three tournament 
rounds played from Nov. 18 
through Nov. 20 at the Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championships hosted by UC 
Davis at the Schaal Aquatic 
Center. Despite winning its first 
match on Nov. 18 over unranked, 
seventh-seed Air Force, 10-7, 
UCSD, the top-seeded team in 
the tournament, was unable to 
secure any insurance goals in the 
fourth quarter against the 
Redlands team on Nov 19. 

UCSD precariously main-
tained a 5-4 advantage u'ntil 
Bulldogs freshman two-meter 
defender Ryan Hall scored on a 
pass from sophomore two-meter 
man lan Calpin with just 27 sec-
onds remaining on the game 
clock. Then, with a little more 
than a minute remaining in the 
second three-minute overtime 
period, Redlands freshman driver 
Kevan Whelan notched the game-
winner from the left side of the 
cage. The Tritons faced tourna-
ment host UC Davis on Nov. 20 
in the third-place game that 
UCSD controlled, 9-7. The 
Tritons concluded their 2004 sea-
son with an overall 20-12 record. 
This is the third time in the last 
five seasons that head coach 
Denny Harper's teams have 
breached the 20-win barrier. 
. In their victory over Air Force, 

the Tritons jumped out to an early 
3-2 lead in the first quarter, but fell 
back to a 4-4 tie by the half, thanks 
to Falcons sophomore driver Kyle 
Schafer's two goals. 

The opening three minutes of 
the third quarter were back and 
forth until Air Force was in the 
lead, 6-S. Then the Tritons stepped 

up. Junior two-meter man Chris 
Finegold scored two of his game-
high three goals as part of a nine-
minute, S-O scoring drive that left 
UCSD untouchable. 

A last-minute score by the 
Falcons senior Murphey Morgan 
wasn't enough to put Air Force in 
strilcing distance, and the Tritons 
advanced victorious, 10-7. 

In addition to Finegold's three 
goals, freshman driver Adnan 
Jerkovic tallied a pair, while junior 
drivers Chris Eichholz and 
Nicholas Takahashi, junior two-
meter Matthew Budnick and fresh-
man drivers Nathan Weiner and 
Benjamin Miller were each respon-
sible for a goal. 

Triton junior goalie Colin 
McElroy recorded five saves in the 
effort. 

Redlands came into the semifi-
nal match on Nov. 19 fresh off of 
the program's first-ever win over 
fourth-seed BYU-Hawaii in an 
adrenaline-packed 7-6 match, and 
was ready for the Tritons. 

The game remained close for 
the duration, neither team emerg-
ing wit,h a clear upper hand, 
although the Tritons never fell 
behind Redlands during regulation 
play, thanks to goals from Jerkovic. 
UCSD held control, S-4, in the 
fourth quarter until the final pos-
session and Calpin's tragically 
timed score. 

Sole Triton senior Nate 
Cooper, playing in his last tourna-
ment, threw a spinning lob shot 
toward the back of the cage, but 
Redlands junior goalie Casey 
Finfrock came up with his 10th 
save of the match to prevent a 
sudden-death, third overtime 
period. 

Playing for third place against 
the Aggies on Nov. 20, the Tritons 
took an early lead and never 
looked back en route to their 9-7

The UCSD men's basketball 
team suffered an opening game 
defeat to University of San Diego 
on Nov. 20, falling 74-3S to the 
Toreros at the Jenny Craig 
Pavilion . The Tritons, who 
returned no starters from the 
2003-04 season, were held below 
30-percent shooting for the game, 
which marked head coach Bill 
Carr's UCSD debut. 

UCSD began the night aggres-
sively with a block and three 
rebounds in the opening minutes. 
After Torero senior center Brice 
Vounang scored the first points of 
the night, UCSD junior guard 
Odioh Odiye responded with a 
three-pointer. Freshman guard 
Andrew Hatch then answered a 
lay-up with a jumper, coming off 
of junior guard Zach Zanolli's sec-
ond assist. 

The Toreros then picked up 
their offensive and defensive 
game, going on a 24-7 run. Triton 
sophomore guard Robby Peters 
gave UCSD some momentum 
heading into halftime with a 
three-pointer at the end of the 

half. 
A balanced Torero team effort, 

in which head coach Brad Holland 
was able to get all 12 of his players 
some playing time, went on a 17-0 
run early in the second quaner. 
The Tritons managed to get with-
in 29 points on a three-point play 
by sophomore forward Chris 
Randall, who was named the Most 
Improved Player on last year's 
team. 

Randall and Peters led the 
Tritons with eight points each, 
while transfer student Odiyeh col-
lected a game-high eight rebounds 
to go along with three points, one 
block and a team-high three 
assists. The Toreros had four play-
ers score in double digits, led by 
center Vounang with 12. Torero 
junior forward Corey Belser com~ 
piled an impressive stat line with 
11 points, five rebounds, four 
assists, six steals and one block in 
29 minutes. Belser came within 
one steal of the school record. 

In front of a home crowd of 
812, the Toreros shot .569 from 
the field and .467 from three-
point range. After not making a
