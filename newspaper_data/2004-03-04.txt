University officials and Dr.

"Seusscentennial ," the gathering .

memorative postage stamp by the 
U.S. Postal Service as well as the 
unveiling of a life- ize bronze 
sculprure of Geisel. 

Acting Chancellor Marsha A. 
Chandler commenced the ceremo-

birthday, and the legacy of Geisel. 

"Everyone knows March 2 is a

Campus reacts to 
election results 

Kerry wins nomination, SD 
mayor heads to runoff 

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

Just over four hundred voters 
cast their votes on campus choos-
ing presidential candidates, state 
and local candidates, as well as 
voting on ·state and local initia-
tives in the March 2 primary elec-
tions. 

Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) 
secured a commanding lead in the . 
race for the Democratic Party 
presidential nomination. 
Meanwhile, Mayor Dick Murphy 
and Councilman Scott Peters, 
who each failed to win complete 
re-elections, will head to the 
runoff elections in November. 

1liiy Wq/Cuardan 
CIwIc duly: Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior Nate Colton votes at 
Price Center on March 2. 

Kerry won in nine out of ten 
states, leading Sen. John Edwards 
(D-N.C.), his last serious oppo-
nent to drop out of the race on 
March 3. In California, Kerry 
received 64 percent of the votes 
and Edwards acquired 24 percent. 

"The primaries crowned the 
success of Kerry's campaign, 
which had been showing fabulous 
momentum since his victory in 
Iowa," Political science professor 
Gary Jacobson said. "It also shows 
a fervent desire within the 
democrats to replace Bush, and 
after the Iowa victory, they were 
convinced that he would be the 
best candidate in beating 
President Bush." 

Students voted on campus at 
two polling locations, one atJohn 
Muir College and the other at 
Price Center. The two sites 
counted a total turnout of 458 
voters, about half as many as dur-
ing the recall election. 

"It looks like people are still 
voted out from the recall elec-
tion," said Price Center assistant 
precinct manager Jack Buehler. 
"The presidential part maybe 
doesn't seem to be very competi-
tive at this point in time." 

This marked San Diego 
County's first use of electronic 
touchscreen voting, which caused 
some problems throughout the 
county. At the Muir polling loca-
tion, the machines would not start

GSA 
resolves to 

support 
Huerta 

ByUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

The Graduate Student 
Association issued a resolution Feb. 
23 urging Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger .to reappoint UC 
Regent and prominent labor 
activist Dolores Huerta for a full 
12-year term to the UC Board of 
Regents. 

Huerta was appointed by former 
Gov. Gray Davis in September 
2003 to replace Regent Norman 
Pattiz and to serve the remaining 
six months of his term. Huerta's 
term expired on March 1. 

"The GSA passed this resolu-
tion because in the last six months, 
Regent Huerta has been one of the 
most open and accessible advocates 
for students on the Board of 
Regents," 'said Heather Flowe, 
GSA vice president of academic 
affairs. 

The GSA argues in its resolu-
tion that within her short term as a 
Regent, Huerta "has gained the 
respect and admiration of many 
students and peers within the 
University of California." 
According to Flowe, Huerta has 
been very accessible to students at 
Board of Regents meetings. Last 
November, Huerta was one out of 
four Regents who addressed stu-
dents that were holding a rally out-
side a Regents meeting to protest 
university fee increases. 

"Huerta represents UC students,

I BRIEFLY 
Local police, investigators 
team up on fake ID arrests 

Twelve people were arrested in the vicinity 
of UCSD for using counterfeit identification 
while attempting to buy alcoholic beverages on 
Feb. 27. 1he arrests were made during an oper-
ation that included investigators from the 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the 
San Diego Police Department and the UCSD 
Police Department. 

ABC investigators and the local police were 
conductin~ a program called 'Cops-In-Shops 
operation, in which plain-clothes police officers 
observe patrons of ABC-licensed businesses 
and step in to make an arrest when underage 
individuals attempt to buy alcoholic beverages 
using false identification. The operation was 
funded as part of a $50,000 grant from ABC to 
the San Diego Police Department to address 
alcohol abuse and binge drinking by college 
students. 

Funding for the program derives from the 
State Office of Traffic Safety and administered 
by ABC as part of the ABC/UC: Partnership 
Project, wh ich involves six campuses. Each 
campus receives up to S50,000 for on-campus 
programs educating students on the subject of 
binge drinking and alcohol abuse. Local law 
enforcement agencies in campus communities 
are also receiVing grants to focus on off-cam-
pus issues involVing alcohol, including targeting 
adults who fumish alcohol to minors and retail 
outlets that sell to underage or obviously intox-
icated students. 

'Official-looking' e-mails 
contain viruses, ACS warns 

Academic Computing Services is warning of 
a new virus that is sending ·official-Iooking'" e-
mails to UCSD e-mail users from addresses 
such as support@ucsd.edu, help@ucsd.edu, 
managers@ucsd.edu and other local depart-
mental addresses. The message sent by the 
Bagle-! virus usually sounds official, asking 
users 0 follow attached instructions or claiming 
that the e-mail account has been suspended. 
To prevent infection, attachments should not 
be opened. 

A. 10ther recent virus, which ACS claimed is 
under control, had allowed student access to a 
massive listse lV that included all the e-mails of 
students who entered UCSD in 2002{)3. The

A.S.: Five running for president 
continued from page I 

missioner races ran unopposed. 
Five candidates filed to run for A.S. pres-

ident: Jeremy Cogan, Harish Nandagopal, 
Jenn Pae, Kris Saradpon and Steve York. 
Melinda Gibson and Cat Yapyuco will com-
pete for vice president internal and Kevin 
Hanson faces off against Denis Shmidt for 
vice president of finance. 

Only Rigo Marquez runs unopposed for 
vice president external while Jared Feldman 
and Caroline Song will vie for vice president 
of academic affairs. 

The candidates signed on to only two 
slates, Unity and Students First!, compared 
to four last year. Unity claims seven candi-
dates, including Cogan for president, while 
Students First! claims eleven, with 
Nandagopal for president. There are also 
eight candidates running as independents. 

Several candidates ran in last year's elec-
tion. Marquez, who was disqualified along 
with the entire Students First! slate, ran as 
vice president external. Kishi Shah, who was 

also disqualified with Students First!, is run-
ning for the second time as commissioner of 
programming. Brian Uiga, who contended 
for president last year, is running for com-
missioner of communications. York, Uiga's 
fortner slatemate, also ran as vice president 
internal last year. York was responsible for 
filing the original grievance in the 2003 
election that led to the disqualification of 
the Students First! slate. 

One candidate, current A.S. 
Commissioner of Student Services Kelly 

. Vasant, is running for re-election. 
Chapman credited the on-time applica-

tions to new efforts by the A.S. elections com-
mittee, which oversees the process and hears 
grievances, to alert candidates of potential 
problems before they occur. 

"We're stating [the rules) explicidy this 
year because it's been a problem in previous 
years," Chapman said. "This year, we decided 
to make them clear prior to any violations."

Huerta: GSA supports interim regent 
continued from page I 

present and furure, who do not 
want their fees to be increased, 
financial aid rolled back or to see 
enrollments decreased," Flowe said. 

Huerta is also known for her 
experience as a labor and farm 
workers activist. In 1955, she was a 
co-founder of the Stockton. Calif. 
cha pter ~f the Communi ty Service 
Organization, a grassroots organi-
zation that combated social injus-
tices and pushed for improved 
public services. She worked with 
union leader Cesar Chavez to 
form the National Farm Workers 
Association in 1962, which has 
since become the United Farm 
Workers of America. 

Through her work at UFW; 
Huerta has represented farmers 
and their families throughout the 
San Joaquin Valley. She has 
recruited workers, organized 
strikes and negotiated contracts 
on behalf of la borers. She has also 
been honored with numerous 
awards, including the American 
Civil Liberties Union Roger 
Baldwin Medal of Liberty. 

According to the GSA resolu-

tion, Huerta "has dedicated her life 
to the fight for equal representa-
tion and rights of all Californians," 
and can bring "a unique and 
important voice to issues affecting 
the quality, affordability and acces-
sibility" of the university. 

Members of the GSA also 
believe that as a woman of color, 
Huerta will give certain racial 
groups more of a voice on the 
board. 

"As a woman of color, [Huerta] 
represents a large segment of 
California's population and 
embodies the hope that the body of 
UC students will one day be more 
reflective of the state as a whole in 
terms of its racial and socioeco-
nomic composition," Flowe said. 

Thus, the GSA resolution 
states that Huerta's experience 
with activism combined with her 
racial and social background put 
her in a good position to represent 
immigrant, first generation and 
low-income students. 

"The unique thing about 
[Huerta) is that she's the only 
Regent who represents the San 
Joaquin Valley, low-income fami-

lies and people of color," said 
Camila Chavez, executive director 
of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, 
a foundation Huerta started to 
train grassroots activists. 

in passing the resolution, the 
GSA has affirmed its decision to 
support Huerta as a Regent and 
hopes that the governor will reap-
point her. 

"[Huerta's] reappointment as 
Regent would allow her to contin-
ue being a role model to those 
who strive for higher education 
and better employment," GSA 
president Eric Frechette said. 

According to Chavez, over 
3,000 letters supporting Huerta 
have been sent to the governor and 
the campaign appears promising. 

"This whole campaign has 
shown that the students are 
behind Huerta, and that's the 
important thing because that's 
who she's representing on the 
board," Chavez said. 

The UC Board of Regents 
consists of 18 regents who are 
appointed by the governor, seven 
ell-officio members and a student 
regent.

Bylaws: Candidates expect 
less contentious elections 

continued from page I 
the seriousness of the violations. II 

Candidates lauded Chapman's 
decision to distribute information 
sheets with the committee's expec-
tations. 

"1 really appreciate the informa-
tion the Elections Committee com-
piled so that we are aware of where 
the committee is at," said A.S. vice 
president internal Jenn Pae, who is 
running for A.S. president. 
"They're making sure tha t every-
thing is fair and ensuring that we're 
all starting off on the same foot. 
That makes things a lot easier for 
us." 

This year, the elections commit-
tee will use a point system to assess 
the seriousness of violations in 
order to provide a more consistent 
approach to penalties for election 
bylaws violations. Some of the vio-
lations that could lead to disqualifi-
cation would include tampering 
with ballots, falsifying statements 
to the elections commi ttee, and 
campaigning within 50 feet of the 
polls on election day. Chapman 
emphasized that while the commit-
tee would try to adhere to the point 
system, it is non-binding and the 
committee reserves the right to 
penalize violators as they see fit. 

Many candidates, such as A.S. 
Commissioner of Enterprises and 
A.S. presidential candidate Jeremy 
Cogan, believe that the guidelines 
will help make the election run 
more smoothly. 

"I do feel that it was a good' way 
for the committee to potentially 
explain the consistent strategy 
they'll use to apply' the bylaws," 
Cogan said. "It's a good supple-
ment to what's already there." 

The commi ttee will also now 
require that candidates filing griev-
ances go through an informal reso-

lution process with the elections 
manager prior to filing a formal 
grievance to the committee. 
Chapman believes that this process 
will more effectively resolve many 
of the grievances filed during the 
election period. 

"If there 's a process by which 
things can be resolved outside of a 
hearing, then that would be a posi-
tive to all sides, [assuming] all sides 
can resolve their problems outside 
of a hearing," Cogan said. "It's not 
necessarily a substitute for the 
hearing process if the sides cannot 
reach an agreement. II 

The corrunittee also moved to 
end the practice of "poster saving," 
which slates used last year and in 
the past. If there is a "direct corre-
lation" berween posters hung 
before the campaign period that are 
replaced by posters hung immedi-
ately after the campaign period 
begins, the committee would con-
sider that an act of campaigning 
outside the campaigning period , 
which could lead to disqualifica-
tion. The committee also empha-
sized a number of bylaws regarding 
the improper use of campaign 
materials, stating that the commit-
tee would stricti y enforce the 
bylaws. 

Most candidates predict a less 
contentious election than last year, 
which featured numerous griev-
ances and disqualifications. 

"1 think that the election com-
mittee has done .a better job this 
year than before in defining what 
exactly things are," A.S. Vice 
President External and presidential 
candidate Harish Nandagopal said. 
"1 think that's better for all candi-
dates and all parties involved."

election process can be found at

W)tat Dynes should look

T he committee to select a new UCSD chancellor submitted 
a short list of recommended 
candidates to UC President 
Robert C. Dy:Ies on Feb. 
25. Dynes' selection, and 
p'ermanent reQlacement for 
the job he left in October 
2003 to head up the UC sys-
tem, will most likely be 
announced by the end of the 
month, pending approval by 
the Board of Regents. 

While the candidate list 
prepar:ed by the search 
committee IS kept secret, 
the criteria by' which Dynes 
will make a selection should 
be up for debate. The chan-
cellor position's official 
requirements include 
"leadership skills in an aca-
demic environment," 
"senior experience in the 
administration of large-
scale, diverse, and complex 
organizations" and "a

However, there are some 
other attributes the incom-
ing chancellor must have in 
oraer to be successful. 

Dynes knows that one of 
his strengths as chancellor 
was attracting outside, pri-
vate fundi l1g for research

UniversitY. of California 
announceo Feb. 26 that it 
will turn away 3,200 eligible 
high school seniors. Iri the 
past, they would have been 
guaranteed a spot on at least 
one UC campus. These stu-
dents, who ' were told all 
year that their admission 
was guaranteed, will now be 
redirected to community 
colleges. Whether or not 
this technically breaches the 
California Master Plan for 
Higher Education, it cer-
willy betrays its promise of

finds itself at a crossroads: 
This could be an unfortu-

or it could be the beginning 
of a drastic and permanent 
reduction of accessibility. 

Decreasing enrollment is

Flops to the floppers 

of A.S. senator 
Editor: 

Flops to the GUlIrdilin for sin-
gling out former A.S. Senator 
Jordan Rosenfeld . 

Although the media have tradi-
tionallyexisted to hold government 
accountable to the people it repre-
sents, I see little reason for the 
Guardill1l to insult Rosenfeld's per-
sonal decision to resign. I am 
appalled at the Guardian's attitude 
toward those who choose to dedi-
cate a great deal of their time, effort 
and emotion to student govern-
ment. ASUG:SD is a huge time 
commionent, and an individual's 
decision to weigh academics over 
extracurricular activities should not 
be subject to the type of insensitive 
scrutiny exemplified in this blase 
comment. Rosenfeld's resignation 
in no way negates the weeks during 
which he thoughtfully served his 
constituency and respectfully 
worked with his feUow senators. 

Instead of contributing ttl the 
distrust and suspicion aroused by 
the representation of Associated 
Srudents as an elitist, unfair and 
now irresponsible institution, per-
haps the editors should consider 
contributing to a campus where 
students fed welcome in their stu-
dent council meetings, fed com-
fortable addressing their needs to 
student representatives, and are 
Wlderstanding of the pressures on 
students, academic or otherwise, 
that come into conflict with 
extracunicular commionents. 
Councilmembers beg the student 

body to provide input to their sen-
ator'S, attend meetings and become 
educated on the issues on a weeldy 
basis; printing these exhortations 
rather than paying attention to the 
Wlusually high number of resigna-
tions this year would not only 
improve ASUCSD's Wlwarranted 
negative image, it could conceiv-
ably increase the efficiency of sru-
dent representation on campus.

Diversity exists at 
Bob Jones University 

Editor: 
1bis is regarding Chris Taylor's 

article, "Public universities should 
not indoctrinate students" (Feb. 
23,20(4). 

I am currently a junior in the 
political science program at Bob 
Jones University. 

The teachers in my classes 
allow lively discussion, disagree-
ment and even error. 

While politically the faculty 
tend to be very conservative, they 
are more accurately "Christian" in 
their outlook. Their Christianity is 
based on the authority of the Bible 
instead of their own man-made 
philosophy. BJU's purpose is differ-
ent from public institutions. BJU 
intends to train good Christians, 
while public schools' purpose is to 
provide a forum for all viewpoints. 

Apparently the students who 
come to school here want the 
"indoctrination" of this school 
because they work long hours to 
pay a tuition that is not very well 
subsidized by scholarship money. 
Many families work together to 
put their children through school. 
The clientele of the school comes 
from lower- to upper-middle class 
backgrounds. 

We have students from all 50 
states and almost 40 foreign COWl-
tries. Only about 20 percent of the 
srudents are from South Carolina. 
We are diverse ethnically. This 
morning I ate brealc&st with a stu-
dent from Haiti. We are similar to 
many other schools aroWld the 
country, except that our purpose is 
more clearly defined than most.

THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

All the complexities of the IBig Apple,' right here at UCSD 
Campus has its own codes of cond~ct, departments and legislative bodies 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn H~ieh 

People don't normally think about apples. The Red Delicious or Gala that they 
hold in their hand is just a healthy 
snack for busy days, or a good com-
plement to a light meal. Look 
deeper, though, and it is salient that 
the apple. doesn't just magically 
appear. 

First, it must be bought from 
Vons, or maybe Trader Joe's . 
Before it is put on display next to 
its orange and banana brethren, 
the apples must be shipped from a 
farm, probably located some-
where in California's Central 
Valley. The grocery store employ-
ee took it out of a box that was 
constructed at a box factory in, 
say, Ohio. The trees from which 
the apples are grown must be cul-
tivated with some kind of fertiliz -
er that is produced by another 
company. The pesticides that coat 
the apple must come from a sup-
plier, and so forth. Along the way, 
hundreds of people, places and 
plans contributed to the very 
moment in which Bob decides to 
can his low-carbohydrate Atkins 
diet and succumb to the satisfying 
crunch of an apple. The many 
transactions necessary to allow a 
seemingly simple act is the stuff 
economists tackle, not something 
ordinary folk think much about. 

. An even bigger apple (no, not 
New York) is UCSD. I'd guess 
that not' many students give much 
thought or care to the enormous 
reach and incredible complexity of 
a school such as our own. I never 
really thought about the scope of 
the UCSD entity either. In fact, it 
was only recently that I had my 
mini-epiphany when I saw signs 
with the words to the effect of 
"UC San Diego Auxiliary Tax 
Planning" at the Torrey Pines 
office complex, which houses all 
the business and logistical opera-
tions for the school. 

Like the complicated process 
that results in availing oneself of 
fresh apples, the act of talcing an 
exam or eating in Price Center is 
the end product made possible by a 
massive UCSD operation. The 
extent of this operation and its 
impact rivals that of any major cor-
poration. Acting Chancellor 
Marsha Chandler could probably 
trade a couple of tips and tales with 
the corporate Icing himself, Bill 
Gates. 

Srudents have a loose knowl -
edge about the structure and fac-
tors that contri bute to our educa-
tion. Although our world is most-
ly limited to the confines of 

UCSD'~ dassrooms and campus, 
students understand that profes-
ors conduct research with and for 

the school's money, that Center 
Ha Il's bathrooms are cleaned by 
janitors, and that StudentLink 
schedules afe carefully created by 
enrollment, department and 
administrative personnel. 

Do students know, however, 
lha t the school is run not only by 
one chancellor but also by eight 
vice chancellors? There are vice 
chancellors for academic affairs, 
research and graduate studies, 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 
student affairs, resource manage-
mem and planning, external rela-
tions, buslO ss affairs, and health 
sClence~ and health care. In addi-
tion, there arc many more associ-
ate vIce chancellors and, all told, 
some 23,000 rmployees - more 
than one employee for every 
undergraduate student enrolled -

working for UCSD in some capac-
ity. The UCSD Reference Shelf 
Web site, bttp:liw1JJ7J1-
tr. flesd. tdulucsdrtJtrmctsbtJf, pro-
vides an abWldance of information 
about the ins and outs of this uni-
versity. 

UCSD is one of the largest 
employers in San Diego CoWlty, 
coming only after the federal, state 
and school district offices. In addi-
tion, as reported in the Feb. 2 issue 
of the GJumJUm, ·the annual fiscal 
revenue of UCSD last year was 
$1.8 billion and the generated eco-
nomic impact was $5.1 billion. 
Crazy, isn't it? 

From a perspective more rele-
\lant to students, the academic 
livelihood of students at UCSD is 
made possible by an abundance of 
faculty, staff and administration. 
As an Associated Students repre-
sentative in an enrollment com-
mittee, it blows my mind to see the 
vision and planning that goes into 
admitting a student. For example, 
the committee (made up of maybe 
15 faculty and administrators plus 
two students) pores over tons of 
percentages and proposals from 
the office of the president to come 

up with a number of new admits. 
Students become an acronym 
(FrEs, which stands for full-time 
enrollment), which doesn't mean 
that wl'.'re any less important, bllt 
just become a more business-
appropriate unit. And there are 
dozens more committees for 
everything, from naming parking 
structures to maintai,ung the qual-
ity of the libraries. 

Then there's the mysterious 
Academic Senate, which summons 
images of some Star Wars-esque 
assembly of srately very important 
persons, decreeing our academic 
agenda and sentencing plagiariz-
ers to life without purpose. In 
reality, the Academic Senate is a 
representative assembly of faculty, 
with committees on specific acad-
emic issues. It meets almost . 
monthly to vote and discuss mat-
ters that are actually quite rele-
vant to our lives, probably more 
so than what the other "A.S." (that 
is, Associated Students) on cam-
pus does. In addition, they deal 
with the "other" dimension on 
campus - professors' research, 
publications, and think-rank-like 
centers on campus that keep 
UCSD and the University of 

California in general floating on 
the top of the school-ranking 
charts. According to their Web 
site, the Academic Senate, on 
"standing Orders of the Regents, 
exercises direct control over the 
authorization and supervision of 
all courses and curricula, determi-
nation of admission and gradua-
tion requirements, and approval 
of all manuscripts published by 
the University of California 
Press." 

Yes, the Regents, everyone's 
favorite scapegoat. To even begin 
exploring the intricacy of the high-
er-level UC management would be 
an invitation to a dissertation-
length article. The UC system as a 
whole is a colossus on a national 
and international level. It even has 
a lobbying-type office in 
Washington, D.C., a testament to 
both its scale and its stature. 

Down home in San Diego, 
though, it's important not to for-
get the less-known but equally 
important organization that allows 
us to study here, and it's beyond 
the mere derogatory label of 
"bureaucracy." There's Physical 
Plant Services, which deals with all 
the school infrastructure and 

Beneath 

maintenance. There's Business 
Mfairs, which handles the afore-
mentioned taxes, payroll and other 
financial and resource matters. 
There's a special public relations 
office that exists just to get UCSD 
on the map of national and region-
al consciousness. Then there 's 
University Events Office, 
Catering, Transportation and 
Parking Services, and so forth . 
This is just scratching the surface 
of the enormity that is UCSD. 

The confluence of all these 
efforts, a magnified apple transac-
tion if you may, contribute to the 
overarching principle of advancing 
knowledge in the local and global 
community, of course to ultimately 
give us, the students, a world-class 
educational experience. Note the 
word "experience" - an encom-
passing, entire enterprise. It's not 
just a matter of going to class and 
learning, it's also the massive pro-
duction that allows us to study in 
library or wash our hands. That 
being said, that apple doesn't look 
the same now, does it?

What Dynes should look

T he committee to select a new UCSD chancellor submitted 
a short list of recommended

25. Dynes' selection, and 
p'ermanent replacement for

be up for debate. The chan-

organizations" and "a

However, there are some 
other attributes the incom-
ing chancellor must have in 
oreer to be successful.

his stren~s as chancellor 
was attracting outside, pri-

projects. He successfully 
~p~arheaded the "Imagine

p~!gn to raise $1 billion for 
UCSD. The next chancellor 

must also convince outside

transactions necessary to allow a 
seemingly simple act is the stuff 
economists tackle , not something 
ordinary folk think much about. 

An even bigger apple (no, not 
New York) is UCSD. I'd guess 
that not many students give much 
tnought or care to me enormous 
reach and incredible complexity of 
a school such as our own. I never 
really thought about me scope of 
the UCSD entity either. In fact, it 
was only recently that I had my

Do students know, however, 
that the school is rlln not only by 
one chancellor but also by eight 
vice chancellors? There are vice 
chancellors for academic affairs, 
research and graduate stud ies, 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 
student affairs, resource manage· 
ment and planning, external rela -
tions, bus mess affairs, and health 
sCiences and health care In addi-
tion, there arc mallY more associ-
nlc vice chancellors "nJ, all told, 
some 23,000 employees - more 
than one employee for every 
undergraduate student enrolled -

working for UCSD in some capac-
ity. The UCSD Reference Shelf 
Web site, bttp://71l11)'IJ)-
tr: WId. tdu/rwd,.tfn-t1lcesbtlf, pro-
vides an abundance of information 
about me ins and outs of this uni-
versity. 

UCSD is one of the largest 
employers in San Diego County, 
coming only after the federal, state 
and school district offices. In addi-
tion, as reported in the Feb. 2 issue 
of the Gturrdilm, ·the annual fiscal 
revenue of UCSD last year was 
$1.8 billion and the generated eco-
nomic impact was $5.1 billion. 
Crazy, isn't it? 

From a perspective more rele-
\(ant to students, the academic 
livelihood of students at UCSD is 
made possible by an abundance of 
faculty, staff and administration. 
As an Associated Students repre-
sentative in an enrollment com-
mittee, it blows my mind to see the 
vision and planning that goes into 
admitting a student. For example, 
the committee (made up of maybe 
15 faculty and administrators plus 
two students) pores over tons of 
percentages and proposals from 
the office of me president to come 

up wim a number of new admits. 
Students become an acronym 
(FTEs, which stands for full-time 
enrollment), which doesn't mean 
that we're any less important, but 
just become a more business· 
appropriate unit. And there are 
dozens more committees for 
everything, from naming parking 
structures to maintaining the qual-
i ty of me Ii braries. 

Then there's the mysterious 
Academic Senate, which summons 
images of some Star Wars-esque 
assembly of stately very important 
persons, decreeing our academic 
agenda and sentencing plagiariz· 
ers to life without purpose. In 
reality, me Academic Senate is a 
representative assembly of faculty, 
with committees on specific acad-
emic issues. It meets almost . 
monthly to vote and discuss mat-
ters that are actually quite rele· 
vant to our lives, probably more 
50 than what the orner" A.S." (that 
is, Associated Srudents) on cam-
pus does. In addition, they deal 
with me "other" dimension on 
campus - professors' research, 
publications, and m .ink-tank-like 
centers on campus that keep 
UCSD and the University of 

Califr-mia in general floating on 
me top of me school-ranking 
charts. According to meir Web 
site, the Academic Senate, on 
"standing Orders of me Regents, 
exercises direct control over the 
aumorization and supervision of 
all courses and curricula, determi-
nation of admission and gradua-
tion requirements, and approval 
of all manuscripts fublished by 
the University 0 California 
Press." 

Yes, the Regents, everyone 's 
favorite scapegoat. To even begin 
exploring the intricacy of the high-
er-level UC management would be 
an invitation to a dissertation-
length article. The UC system as a 
whole is a colossus on a national 
and international level. It even has 
a lobbying-type office in 
Washington, D.C., a testament to 
born its scale and its stature. 

Down home in San Diego, 
though, it's important not to for-
get me less-known but equally 
important organization mat allows 
us to study here, and it's beyond 
the mere derogatory label of 
"bureaucracy." There's Physical 
Plant Services, which deals with all 
the school infrastructure and 

maintenance. There's Business 
Mfairs, which handles the afore-
mentioned taxes, payroll and other 
financial and resource matters . 
There's a special public relations 
office that exists just to get UCSD 
on the map of national and region-
al consciousness. Then there 's 
University Events Office, 
Catering, Transportation and 
Parking Services, and so forth . 
This is just scratching the surface 
of the enormity that is UCSD. 

The confluence of all these 
efforts, a magnified apple transac-
tion if you may, contribute to the 
overarching principle of advancing 
knowledge in the local and global 
community, of course to ultimately 
give us, the srudents, a world-class 
educational experience. Note the 
word "experienc(!" - an encom-
passing, entire enterprise. It's not 
just a matter of going to class and 
learning, it's also the massive pro-
duction that allows us to study in 
library or wash our hands. That 
being said, mat apple doesn't look 
the same now, does it?

Geisel: Stamp, bronze sculpture unveiled 
cantin ued from page I 

the occasion of what would have 
been his 100th birthday. This year 
marks the official 
'Seusscentennial. ... 

Following Chandlers opening 
remarks. Dennis P. Smith. execu-
tive director of the San Diego 
Council on Literacy. spoke of the 
importance of literacy and 
thanked Geisel for his contribu-
tion to the cause. 

"There are millions of adults 
who never experienced the joy of 
reading 'Cat in the Hat' .1:0 their 
children." Smith said. "In order for 
a free democratic society to exist. all 
its members need the necessary lit-
eracy skiJls to function." 

According to Smith, approxi-
mately 23 percent of the adult 
population across the United 
States cannot read above the 
fourth-grade level, deeming them 
functiona lly iIIit-erate. In San 
Diego County alone, he said, 
there are 450,000 adults who pos-
sess only minimal literacy skills. 

0Mj uns/Guanian 
Goins postal: Audrey Geisel, widow of Theodor Seuss Geisel. claps at the 
unveiling of a commemorative stamp (back) issued nationwide on March 2. 

"We support and thank Dr. 
Seuss for creating a world of words 
and opening the doors to increase 
literacy in past. current and future 
generations," Smith said. 

Following Smith's remarks, 
Angelo Wider, manager of the U.S . 
Postal Service Finance 
Administration, spoke about the 
new stamp. A lO-by-8 foot replica 
of the stamp was presented to audi-
ence member shortly thereafter. 

"Today we are here to do far 
more than simply dedicate a 
po tage stamp. We are also here to 
honor the very special man on that 
stamp, Theodor Seuss Geisel, who 
is better known to children of all 
ages as Dr. Seuss," Wider said. 
"Geisel introduced countless chil-
dren to the enjoyment of reading 
by reminding us that learning can 
not only be fun, but it can be 
funny." 

Designed by Carl T. Herman 
of Carlsbad, the colorful stamp 
features Geisel surrounded by 
characters from his books. The 
U.S Post Office plans to issue a 
total of 172 million. 37 -cent com-
memorative stamps. 

"The stamp helps us to gain a 
better appreciation and under-
standing of the world of fantasy, a 
necessary ingredient in living, as 
Theodor Seuss Geisel tried to 

remind us," Wider said. 
Shortly before the Wlveiling of 

the bronze statue of Geisel, UCSD 
University Librarian Brian E.C. 
Schottlaender spoke on Geisel's 
contributions to the university. 

"As striking and indeed iconic 
as this Oibrary) is, I don't think 
there is any question that Geisel's 
greatest contribution to UCSD, to 
all of us, was the gift of his imagi-
nation and his advocacy of us 
using our own imaginations," 
Schottlaender said. "The memori-
al will serve as a reminder to us 
that reading and learning are the 
keys to a better world." 

The sculpture, designed by 
widow Audrey Geisel's daughter, 
Lark Grey Dimond-Cates, fea-
tures a life-size representation of 
Geisel sitting in his study chair 
with a 7-foor Cat in the Hat 
looking over his shoulder. 
Dimond-Cates said she 
employed the Cat in the Hat in 
her piece because "it depicts 
[Geisel's) alter ego." 

"He is in the exact position he 
was in all those times in the studio. 
Today, we're all together; we've 
got the whole family, all the crit-
ters and all his works," Audrey 
Geisel said. "Now I have a sense of 
completeness." 

Recalling a walk through cam-
pus the couple took years ago, 
Geisel commented on her hus-
band's longtime attraction to the 
UCSD library. 

"I remember Theodor said, ' If 
I had strayed into archi tecture, I 
might have done something tha-t

looks quite a lot like this,'" she 
said. "At that moment, he had no 
way of knowing that it was his 
library. At that time, Ted would 
not realize the importance of the 
building, but I knew." 

She closed her remarks by 
expressing heJ happiness with the 
community's display of warmth 
toward her husband and his work. 

"He had no realization how 
much a pan of this university he 
would become," Geisel said. "This 
makes me very happy. I'm very 
glad to be sharing it. This is the 
way it was meant to be." 

The Preuss School choir com-
menced and completed the cere-
mony with vocal performances of 
the "Star-Spangled Banner" and 
"Happy Birthday." 

Various exhibits of Geisel's 
work are on display in Geisel 
Library throughout the year. "The 
Dr. Seuss You Never Knew," fea-
turing a collection of work from 
his school days at Dartmouth and 
Oxford, advertising and magazine 
works in the 1920s and 1930s, and 
World War II cartoons, will be on 
display until March 27. 

Theodor Geisel wrote over 44 
children's books that have been 
translated into more than 20 lan-
guages and have sold over 500 mil-
lion copies. The Dr. Seuss 
Collection at UCSD's Geisel 
Library contains most of Geisel's 
original work and consists of 
roughly 8,500 items dating from 
his high school experiences in 
1919 to his death in La Jolla in 
1991. 

THURSDAY. MARCH 4, 2004 

Primari'es: SD fails Prop. A, 
district sends Peters to runoff 

continued from page 3 
58 mandates the enactment of a 
balanced-budget for the state. 
Proposition 57 passed with 63 per-
cent of the votes and Proposition 
58 passed with 7·1 percent. 

"It's a win for the governor 
because it showed that he was will-
ing to take a political risk by back-
ing an idea that was not initially 
popular," political science assistant 
professor Thad Kousser said. "He 
was clearly at the front of the cam-
paign raising money and being part 
of the commercials, and this means 
an increased influence In 
Sacramento for him." 

However, according to Kousser, 
much of the measures' success can 
be attributed to the lack of a solid 
opposition. 

The status of another measure 
on the ballot that would approve a 
SI2.3 billion bond to fund in high-
er education and public school 
facilities was too close to call at 
press time. Proposition 55 received 
50 percent "yes" votes and 49 per-
cent "no" votes with some absentee 
ballots yet to be confirmed as of 
March 3. 

"The apparent passage of 
Proposition 55 will allow us to 
move forward with projects in 
some campuses, including earth-
quake and life-safety improvements 
and improvements for some of our 
research and instructional labs," 
UC spokesperson Abby Lunardini 
said. "We're very heartened to see 
the likely passage for this because if 
it passes, it will go a long way into 
helping us meet some of those 
needs that we've put off for the past 
couple of years." 

According to Kousser, the legis-
lature still faces tough decisions in 
the future even with the bonds pas-. 
sage. 

"California has borrowed 
enough money as it can afford to 
over the coming years. and that 
spells bad news for future bonds," 
Kousser said. "There are still tough 
decisions to be made because there's 
still a deficit, but these decisions will 
be a lot easier with these bonds." 

Prop. 56 received 66 percent of 
the total votes against it. The initia-
tive would have allowed the state 
legislature to pass budgets wi th 55 
percent of the vote instead of two-

thirds. The measure also would 
require that legislators and the gov-
ernor lose salary for each day the 
budget is late and require that leg-
islarure stay in session until a bud-
get is passed. 

In San Diego, Murphy will face 
COWlty supervisor Ron Roberts in a 
mayoral runoff during the 
November elections. Murphy 
received approximately 40 percent 
of the votes while Roberts garnered 
about 30 percent. 

San Diegans also voted for three 
local initiatives on the ballot. 
Proposition A, which would have 
rezoned property in the country's 
backcountry and restrict develop-
ment, failed with 64 percent of the 
votes against it. 

Proposition C, which would 
have raised the transient occupancy 
tax from 10.5 percent to 13 per-
cent, missed the two-thirds majori-
ty it needed in order to pass, and 
received only 61.4 percent as of 
March 3. 

According to urban studies and 
planning professor Erik Bruvold , 
the outcome of the elections 
reflected that San Diegans are wor-
ried about the future of the city and 
were unwilling to raise taxes. 

"I think it showed the voters are 
pretty skeptical about how things are 
going in the region," Bruvold said. 

As of March 3, Prop. B received 
50.1 percent votes in favor and 49.9 
percent against it. The initiative 
deals with the way city counci l 
awards its con truction contracts. 

Meanwhile, Councilman Scott 
Peters. whose disrrict includes 
UCSD, will also fact; runoff elec-
tions in November to keep his posi-
tion against challenger Phil 
Thalheimer. The District 1 repre-
sentative obtained approximately 
49 percent of the votes, while 
Thalheimer kept Peters from out-
right victory with 31 percent of the 
votes. 

"In both cases, the incumbents 
have to try and address issues with 
the city's budget and pension plan," 
Bruvold said. "Voters are going to 
make choices in November based 
upon the ability of the incumbents 
to address those issues in the next 
few months."

THURSDAY. MARCH 4, 2004 

Candidates: 
conti nued from page I 

Nandagopal, who was disquali-
fied last year in his race for vice 
president internal along with the 
Students First! slate, blamed "non-
canuidates" and "third-parties" for 
the problems, and said he expected 
a cleaner race. 

To prevent flyer-posting viola-
tions, responsible for bringing down 
the Students First! slate last year, 
Nandagopal has proposed a volun-
tary agreement among candidates 
not to "poster-save," a practice by 
which campaigns ask campus organi-
zations to past their own signs to 
reserve spots until the campaign peri-
od officially begins in spring quarter. 

The election committee said in 
its "Frequently Asked Questions," 
which was distributed at the meet-
ing and is also available online, that 
it would consider this practice a 
violation of bylaws. 

In addition, Nandagopal has 
reregistered the Students First! stu-
dent organization, which was creat-
ed last year and was not related to 
rhe slate, after the organization 
endorsed a . non-Studenrs-First l -
slate presidential candidate last year, 
who had a first and last name iden-
tical to Students First! slate candi-
date Kevin Shawn Hsu. 

He said he wanted to preempt 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

One candidate unopposed 
potential attempts by outside groups 
from thwarting the slate's campaign. 

York said he is looking forward 
to the campaigning period. 

"It should be a really good cam-
paign this year, and I hope to really 
debate the issues because the presi-
dential candidates come from a lot 
of different backgrounds and bring 
a lot of different experiences to the 
table," said York, who is running as 
as an independent. 

He said he expected candidates 
to run a clean campaign this year. 

"I think candidates running this 
year on large slates Know that there 
will be candidates running who 
have balls and Know that they're 
not afraid to call bullshit when they 
see it," York said. 

However, Nandagopal said his 
campaign has already received 
attacks, with someone attempting 
to submit a candidate statement 
bearing his name. He sa id the 
forged statement contained 
"extreme" views intended to alien-
ate potential voters. 

Election officials caught the 
problem when they noticed two 
statements filed with Nandagopal's 
name submitted via Internet, 

akanishi said. 
However, Chapman said he 

remained optimistic about the cam-

paign and is expecting a 25 -percent 
turnout, an increase from I?s{ year. 
He credited projected rise to more 
competitive r Jces, with fewer can-
didates running unopposed. 

"I'm really excited about the 
amount of people getting involved 
this year," said Cogan. 

Cogan also said he expected a 
shortened voting period caused by 
a new runoff voting process to 
affect voter participation . 

"I hope students get informed 
and turn out to vote," said Pae, the 
current A.S. vice president internal 
and independent presidential can-
didate. 

Saradpon, a John Muir College 
junior who is running for president 
as an independent candidate, also 
stressed the importance of student 
interest in the election. 

"If the presidential candidates 
and all of the other candidates are 
into it, I think the student body will 
be into it as well," said Saradpon, 
who does not currently hold an 
elected office. 

Students will vote April 5 
through April 7 on StudentLink. If a 
candidate receives less than 50 per-
cent of the vote, runoff voting will 
take place in the following two days.

front and center 
Former UCSD students Switchfoot perform 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

The cameraman is still grinning. H e's JUSt spent 20 minutes dodging the lumpy yellow 
cones of uniformed securiry per-
sonnel, and sprinting back and 
forth across me foot of the stage 
trying to keep the abnormally 
large-lipped frononan 's face in his 
ti ny viewfinder. Speakers me size 
of Cadillac Escalades shoot gentle 
breezes Onto his face, breezes 
which would be soothing if mey 
were not accompanied by ear-
bleeding blasts of noise accompa-
nying each bass note or kick of me 
bass drum. 

There is no room for error. He 
has to keep the shot steady. 

And he succeeds, until a 120-
pound emo kid wearing one shoe 
and a t-shirt from the concession 
tand \vith the price tag still on it 

comes hurtling over me barrier and 
slams squarely into his back, mak-
ing him drop the hot. The engi -
neer peaks over her radio to a 
small army of camera people below: 
"J ared just got nailed by an emo kid 
- you'd better switch him out." 

A tinny reply comes back over 
me radio: j areds fine, despite hav-
ing had a personal record of three 
crowd surfers hit in the last five 
minutes, and he wants to finish his 
shift. Bruised yet triumphant, 
adrenaline flaring, he walks back-
stage to swap war stories with the 
rest of the cameramen before 
heading back in. 

Not mat every moment on a 
WinterFest film crew is a "dan-
gerous pit camera" moment. After 
the token punk band leaves the 
stage, the su pply of emo kids usu-
ally dries up, leaving our army of 
camera people the opportunity to 
mingle with the crowd, shimmy 
onstage for that all-important 
backup singer ass-shot, or just 
watch the spectacle unfold . 

In the middle of me operation, 
a smaller crew sneaks into me 
band's dressing room for an inter-
view. What usually unfolds is 
approximatel y six minutes of 
drunken hilari ty rivaling the fine t 
Sun God moments, as band mem-
bers attempt to answer stock 
career questions while sozzled to 
perfec ti on on the finest liquor 
UCSD Catering has to offer. 

"So, Dishwall a '" how did your 
band choose such a name~" 

There is, of course, an unintelli -
gible rambli ng re ponse, but far 
more entertainment lies in the 
unexpected arts-and-crafts talent of 
the bandmcmbers with their cater-
In g tral'S. Life-size vagilla~ craft ed 
entirely out of h.lm or turkey seem 
to be the mo t popular choices. 

But in a few minutes i tl; all over 
and, armed wim stones of drunken 
ex-pression, me film crew heads 
back to the stage to fa ce me crowd 
and keep the cameras steady so that 
every member of me audience has a 
fa ir chance to see me details of 
singing lips, thrashing guitar picks 
and thumping drum ticks. It's not 
the easiest job, but the occasional 
emo kids and him vaginas make it 
all worthwhile.

Modem-rock lICoIytes: Switchfoot has managed to 
hit the mainstream yet maintain their Christian roots. 

By ANNA DYLEWSKA 
Staff Writer 

Incase you haven't heard of Switch foot or their rousing hit single "Meant to Live," 
there are a few things mat you 
should know. The original 
three members attended 
UCSD, which means that you 
can freely assault them with 
cheers when they take the 
stage at WinterFest. 
Although Switch foot may be 
labeled as a Christian band, 
mey refrain from preaching. 
Instead, they infuse their 
lyrics wim universal themes 
of hope and a spiritual search 

for meaning and adorn them 
with pleasing modern-rock 
tunes. 

The band was formed on 
the beaches of San Diego in 
1996 by brothers Jon and 
Tim Foreman (lead 
singer/guitarist and bassist, 
respectively) and Chad Butler 
(drummer), all of who shared 
a common passion for music 
and surfing. "Switch foot" is a 
surfing term which means to 
change position of your feet 
on the board. The threesome 
jammed in garages then took 
their sound on the road. After 
20 shows, mey were signed by 
the Christian label re:think, 

and released Legend of Chin in 
1997. With an impressi\'e 
tour schedule (averagin g 
about 150 shows per year) 
two more albums, New Wi'y to 
Be HU7fUJn and Leon/ing to 
Breathe, and me addition of 
guitaristlkeyhoardisr jerome 
Fontamillas in 2000, 
Switchfoot garnered a sub-
stantial Christian fan base. In 
2001, the band received a 
Grammy nomination for Best 
Rock Gospel Album of me 
Year. 

After its success, the band 
signed with Columbia

Not too long ago, Convoy worked hard for ubiquiry, with an ambitious sched-

91X's stage at the Pacific 
Beach Block Party, which mey 
headlined, when a popular sin-
gle and what seemed ro be a 
great deal of enmusiasm drew 
a sizable crowd. 

Unfortunately, less is 
remembered about Convoy's 
performance than the faulry 
equipment, me empry beer cans 
trewn across the street, and the 

girls tandi ng up front wearing 
bras and backless tank tops. 

The fact mat Convoy dis-
banded - or, as their Web site 
tates, mat three of its members 

have declared "indefinite hia-
tus" from the band - is only 
coincidentally foretold by that 
unmemorable show; PB Block 
Parry. And itl; surprising, given 
that "Caught up in You" was 
such a catchy single and that 

Bl4clc Licorice was such an enjoy-
able album. 

Nonetheless, they are pro-
visionally no more ("provi-
sionally" because m e website 
claims that there are tentative 
plans for shows later in the 
year according to m e Web 
site, as well as a compilation of 
unreleased music). In 
Convoy's place is Louis XIV. 

Louis XIV, featuring Brian 
Karscig, Jason Hill and Mark 
Maigaard, all formerly of 
Convoy, have an album, a sin-
gle aDd tour dates tucked 
under thei belts . Despite 
Lou is XIV's roots, meir sound 
is a significant departure from 
Convoy's poppy melodic 
sound. It seems the three men 
don't feel constra ined by the 
style that defined them before, 
which is good - no one wants 
recycled material, and clearly 
the boys aren't tryi n g si mpl y 
to reinvent meir old sryle. 

So what do Louis XIV actu-
ally sound like? It's as cI iched to 
compare bands to me Strokes 
as it is for bands to be compa-
rable to the Strokes, it has to be 

done: Louis XIV sounds like a 
fusion of Convoy and the 
Strokes. 

But that is not to say you 
couldn't totally rock out to 
Louis XIv. That isn't even to 
say that they're not good. After 
all, the Strokes are a good band, 
as was Convoy. If you like clas-
sic rock, from which Louis XIV 
obviously draws a fair amount 
of influence, then you'll like 
this group. Although the sound 
is big, the chords are pared-
down, sometimes with a guitar 
solo laid on top but usuaUy just 
clanging over a straight, lively 
beat. It's beyond head-bobbing, 
foot-tapping music - it's jump-
around music. Louis XIV have 
the kind of sound t11at begs you 
ro scream along, not just sing; 
that propels you ro start hop-
ping around at shows; that 
makes boys want to lam into 
one anomer in the front rows. 
"Use me to make your body 
feel right!" they implore over 
the only three chords used in 
the verses of "God Killed the 
Queen." They're onto some-
thing.

'Starsky and Hutch' actors liven remake 
Stiller, Wilson and Ferrell are reason enough to watch 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

There is something magical about the cast that was collected for Todd Phillips' modern-day remake of 
uStarsky and Hutch." Watching Ben Stiller, 
Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Snoop Dogg 
and Will Ferrell join forces on the same 
screen feels almost like watching Magic 
johnson's L.A. Lakers play basketball in the 
1980s. Of course, one cannot forget Carmen 
Electra and Amy Smart. One might consid-
er them the Laker girls; a nice ancillary ben-
efit, but they aren 't why people are buying 
the tickets. 

The metaphor won't be dragged out into 
any more specific terms than this review 
requires, but for those who love comedy, 
there is no question as to whether or not this 
movie should be seen in theaters. The mas-
ters who made this film are in their golden 
age; the lights go off and it's showtime. 

That being said, the film 's vehicle is its 
most restrictive element. Phillips went to 
great lengths to create a remake that would 
do the original series proud. There is li ttle 
question that the authentic elements of the 
film corne at the price of more than a few 
laughs. Audiences may grow frustrated 
more than once when masters like Vaughn, 
Stiller and Wilson are forced to waste time 
on screen hashing out a plot that no one 
care about. 

The film does deserve credit for wearing 
so many shoes in a period of two hours. 
Between having to pay tribute to the origi-
nal series, include a mystery to be solved 

Film 
REVIEW 

and being a buddy comedy, the film was 
pretty creatively constrained. There was 
only so much room for the infusion of zany 
banter that made Phillips' "Old School " so 
successful. 

Ferrell does the best job of giving this 
film a laugh-out-Ioud quaJiry, while Vaughn, 
Stiller and Wilson round out the cast, each 
bringing his own specific brand of humor to 
the screen. Snoop also adds a distinguished 
element to the film playing "urban infor-
mant" Huggy Bear who " lays it out" so 
Starsky and Hutch can "play it out." 

The authenticity of the film, along with 
great comedic performances, made this a 

. good polished piece. Unfortunately me pol-
ish was probably wasted on a 1970s vehicle 
unworthy of the work. At me end of the day, 
watching StiJler, Wilson and the rest of the 
cast in "Starsky and Hutch" was a little like 
watching Magic's Lakers lose: You are a little 
disappointed but still glad that you got to see 
mem play.

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

The equine decline: 'Hidalgo' drags 
Filmic version of true tale could use more suspense, less dead time 

BY RICHIE LAURIDSEN 
Staff Writer 

'H idalgo" proves to be on 
course in its praise for hors-
es by telling a tale of heroism 

and an undying love between man 
and beast, but it seems to fall short 
at the finish line. 

The film tells the story of 
heroic Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo 
Mortensen) and his horse 
Hidalgo, who earn fame as the 
fastest long-distance racing team 
in North America. Appalled that 
a mustang could achieve this dis-
tinction, a doubtful team of 
horse enthusiasts convince 
Hopkins to enter his horse in the 
Grea t Race across the Sahara 

. Desert. 

It is a story of a traditional 
hero, but loses sight of any ele-
ments of suspense. Hopkins and 
his horse continually stand 
together as the defected hero enti-
ty. Both are "mutts" in a race of 
thoroughbreds: Hidalgo is a mus-
tang that rides against the cham-
pion thoroughbred AI-Hattal, 
while Mortensen's character is 
half Native-American in a race 
with Middle-Eastern natives who 
have previously braved the heat of 
the Sahara. 

Characterized as the tough-
guy outsider, Mortensen adopts a 
hard expression throughout most 
of the film and continually faces 
major moral decisions. Despite 
the antagonizing trouble from his 
competitors, Hopkins braves all of

REVIEW 

his challenges fearlessly. 
The aspects of heroism take 

away from the suspense of the 
movie; the hero, though handi-
capped, awaits triumph. 

The steady progression of the 
movie loses any surprise upon the 
approach to the finish line. 
Instead, the only cue the viewer 
has to the finality of the race is the 
crescendo of the music. 

"Hidalgo" dwells on aspects of 
religion, discrimination and the 
magnitude of success. Hopkins 
and Hidalgo celebrate their 
strength and heritage, while many 
other players in the race lear the 
difficulty of discrimination. 

The movie was tasteful and 
entertaining, though dreadfully 
unoriginal. It coines across like a 
blend between "Sea biscuit" and 
"The Mummy," with hints of 
'Dances with Wolves" and 
"Indiana Jones" along the way. If 
the above films strike your cine-_ 
matic fancy, then this should be 
right up your alley.

'Ibrahim' is subtle but enthra,lIing tale 
Flawless story told through smooth and beautiful cinematograp~y 

By NEHA SINGH 
Senior Staff Writer 

On his birthday, a pre-pubes-cent boy shatters his piggy bank, offers his Ii fe's savings to 
a whore, and loses his virginity. So 
begins Francois Dupeyron's mas-
terpiece, "Monsieur Ibrahim et les 
Fleurs du Coran." Adapted from 
the play written by Eric-
Emmanuel Schmitt, this beautiful 
film quietly offers unique and 
thoughtful pt:rspectives on a boy's 
coming-of-age in a matter that 
makes it an aesthetic trt:at. 

"Monsieur Ibrahim" is to Paris 
what "Dirty Pretty Things" is to 
London. Dupeyron's portraya of 
Paris is as offbeat as the plot of a 
Sufi man and Jewish boy becom-
ing friends_ Instead of showing 
cl iche scenes like the Eiffel Tower, 
the Louvrt: museum and the Seine 
River, Dupeyron shows the audi-
ence small brick roads, working 

class neighborhoods, prostitutes 
strutting in the streets and old, 
oppressive homes. By showing 
everyday scenes, he makes Paris 
more accessible. This lends a uni-
versal and realistic quality to the 
film - it is a relief to watch a 
movie set in Paris without it being 
treated as a character. 

Omar Sharif does a fantastic job 
as Monsieur Ibrahim, the local 
grocer who everyone believes to be 
Arab and takes for granted. He 
slowly develops a friendship with 
Momo (pierre Boulanger), a local 
boy who comes in to buy groceries 
and to turn his pocket ehange into 
paper money in order to sleep with 
the local prostitutes. Ibrahim's 
character is sage-like - he gives 
Momo little bits of advice to make 
his frustrating home life better, and 
to boost his sel f-confidence_ Sharif 
could have really botched up . his 
"wise" lines by making them sound 
pretentious, but he delivers them

REVIEW 

flawlessly, often inspiring the view-
er as well as Momo_ 

Boulanger plays the part of 
Momo beautifully. He brilliantly 
showcases the character's inner 
turmoil and desperate struggle to 
be independent and grown up 
without overdoing it. The theme 
of a boy's coming of age has been 
explored in various movies, but 
this is a rare one that does it in a 
subtle and beautiful way. 

"Monsieur Ibrahim" would be 
nothing without its superb cine-
matography and plot_ The smooth 
camera work and clean editing 
lends a sense of sereneness to the 
film, enhancing it- Scenes blend 
into each other seamlessly. The 
switch in setting to Turkey halfway 
through the movie would have 
been utterly disastrous and very 
confusing with bad editing, but it 
does not present a problem here. 
Cinephiles will be pleased to know 
that Dupeyton pays homage to the 
influential French film director 
Jean-Luc Godard in the movie by 
recreating some scenes from some 
of his most famous films, such as 
"The Contempt_" Overall, the 
movie has a slow pace, but it is 
entirely appropriate for the intro-
spective subject material. Added to 
outstanding acting and good edit-
ing, "Monsieur Ibrahim" is a must-

Rising band dios evokes 
spirit of classic pop bands 

Indie-poppers open SOMA show with 
Grandaddy, Saves the Day and Fire Theft 

Courtesy of Oim Mak 

Still broke: Although playing alongside Radiohead and the Pixies, the somber 
and slackerish dios are still working the 9-10-5 shift and drinking cheap beer. 

By BILLY GIL 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

The band dios comes from Hawthorne, a city situated in the sunny South Bay of 
Southern California. While the 
sunbathing beauties and gorgeous 
weather might inspire some bands 
to opt for bright, ca refree music, 
dios delighted to mire in Sunday-
afternoon melancholy with softly 
atmospheric pop songs bringing 
to mind the sadder side of their 
Hawthorne forefathers and musi-
cal heroes, the Beach Boys. 

"We could give a shit about 
surfers or swimming," bassist John 
Paul Caballero bluntly says_ "The 
only good thing about the beach is 
watching the sunset, drunk." 

Don't lump dios in with other 
"throwback" bands that often 
mimic old ~school classical song-
writing with little substance or 
emotion (see Jet and the Sleepy 
J ackson)_ The band is actually 
aware that the last 20 years of 
music happened, coloring their 
already strong compositions with 
ghostly keyboards and off-kilter 
diversions such as the studio chat-
ter and sped-up tape loops which 
open the catchy "You'll Get 
Yours." Beatles-esque chord pro-
gressions are paired with absurd, 
playful lyrics and quiet intimacy, 
recalling Neil Young, who they 
cover on the upcoming self-titled 

debut. Live, dios's mellower lean-
ings are tempered by the ever-pre-
sent desire to rock out, making its 
minimal arrangements unpre-
dictable and epic. 

"We're usually drunk ," 
singer/guitaristJoei Morales dead-
pans. "We gotta hear ourselves , and 
we're very egotistical, so everyone 
turns their shi t up to II." 

Dios are currently racking up 
an impressive resume 'for a little-
known band, with a mention in 
the March 18 issue of Rolling 
Stone issue, a full-page write-up 
in NME's "Bands to Watch for 
2004," a slot on Day I of the 
Coachella Music and Arts Festival 
alongside the Pixies and 
Radiohead, and a warm reception 
to their first EP, Los A.,.bolts, 
released in January. But the band 
has yet to feel the hype machine 
do its dirty business. 

"If there's hype , 1 don't really 
see it," sa id Morales. "I'm still poor 
as shit." 

Along with frequent tour bud-
dies Grandaddy (who occasionally 
cover an old dios song "Love You, 
GirL.. "), dios will play SOMA 
March 9 with emo-pop upstarts 
Saves the Day and the Fire Theft, 
which feature members from 
Sunny Day Rea-I Estate and Foo 
Fighters_ The soow starts at 7:45

Records and released its fourth 
album, The BeilutifUl Letdmm, to a 
wider audience_ Jon Foreman 
asserts that the album tries [Q "talk 
about real pain and real loss and the 
real crap that goes on every day, 
and then in that context talk about 
hope that gets deePer than the 
wound_" 

The album consists of a versa-
tile blend of polished modern 
rock tracks. "Meant to Live" 
mixes Creed-like heavy guitars 
with a chorus that questions peo-
ple's obsession with pop culture: 
"We were meant to Jive for so 
much morelHave we lost our-
selves?" The poppy "This Is Your 
Life" makes use of funky keyboard 
sounds and soft guitars_ "More 
Than Fire," "Dare You to Move" 
and "On Fire" rely on melodic 
acoustic guitars. "Ammunition" 
resembles tunes by Collective 
Soul, while "Gone" is the best 
clap-along Third Eye Blind failed 

to write. The rhythmic "Adding 
to the Noise" boldly states, "If 
we're adding to the noiserrurn off 
this song," and "24" finishes off 
the album with a soft lullaby. 

With sales of The BeilutifUl 
Letdmm steadily climbing, the sin-
gle "Meant to Live" getting a 
healthy jolt of radio overplay, four 
San Diego Music Awards, and 
more than 50 song usages on tele-
vised shows, the band seems to 
have accomplished its goat To top 
it off, they even got to meet their 
idol, U2's Bono, at an AlDS-in-
Africa charity event_ 

Last year, in an interview with

music to surfing. Music is, he said, 
"loud and sweaty_ It's got a certain 
smell to it. And at the end of the 
night there's this energy that's fill-
ing a room." Make sure you watch 
out for this revitalizing force and 
the spiritual stimulus exerted by

The Fiery Furnaces' debut, GIIlIuwbird's Bilrll, is a far-out, jolly ramble with jangly piano and wah-wah guitar tossed into a rucksack and schlepped 
on the back of a time-traveling pirate. 

A real brother-and-sister combo from Brooklyn, 
N_Y, , the Fiery Furnaces rock like a couple of 
saloon muses from the Wild West of another plan-
et. Forget both the cocksure cheese-blues of 
Detroit and the pale-faced punk-pop of New York 
- the Furnaces are out there, like a female Captain 
Beefheart 'spinning the Rolling Stones and 
Karlheinz Stockhausen, shooting doubles of Old 
Crow and AbsinchC;. 

In terms of instantly memorable songs, it's hard to think of a better band out right now than dios. The young band's first full-length delivers a low-
key, la-fidelity collection of songs that never ceas-
es to astound, teeming with ideas and simple 
arrangements that Stay with you long after the 
songs are over. . 

The opener "Nobody's Perfect," begins with a 
slow~building, sci-fi keyboard intro that devolves 
inco mysterious guitar plucking and Joel Morales's 
wistful singing. The keyboards build the song to a 
dynamic climax without ever relying on distorted 
guitar theatrics or overblown Singing, displaying 
dios' hidden power in subtle, tasteful arrangements 
that are nonetheless entirely grabbing_ 

On the catchy "Starting Five," Joel jokes, "If I

Put that over boom-boom blues kick drum,

strange music with something of an acquired taste.

major-to-minor chord hooks. His pilfering of a 
Beach Boys melody in "50 Cents" is excused by the 
song's slow-burning presentation, stripped down 
and eventually reaching a satisfying, harmony-
laden denouement. 

Brother Kevin Morales's songs are a little more 
scattered. "The Uncertainty" is beautiful and epic, 
and "You'll Get Yours" is extremely catchy, but his 
later album entries smack of excessive Beatles wor-
ship. Nonetheless, dios are so likable you won't 
care that their ideas aren't entirely original. If they

*** Talib Kweli's official solo debut, Quality, is a mesh of thought-provoking lyrics and a handful of guest rappers and beats that are created from 

instruments you won 't find on most hip-hop albums. 
"Joy" is a unique track in which Kweli raps about 

the days his kids were born and how they turned him 
into the person he is now_ The beats on the album 
rely heavily on string and brass instruments along 
with pianos, instead of overusing a drum machine. 
This allows the album to flow from one track to the 

- next, as there isn't a hard bass line to adjust to in the 

beginning of each song. 
While most rappers bring in fellow MCs on 

their albums because they cannot carry it on their 
own, this album, instead, provides a forum for 
Kweli's friends to talk about both positives and 
negatives they've seen over the years_ 

Each song is not used to get people into the 
clubs, but rather to go out and make a difference in 
the world they live in .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN ClASSIFlEDS I SPORTS 13 

Baseball: Clark records seven RBI in one game 
continued from page 16 

Iy walking junior righdielder 
Ryan Langone to load the bases 
in front of him, stroking a two-
out, base-dearing double to 
right-center to give UCSO the 
3 -I advantage. 

The Tritons unleashed their 
offensive power in the bottom of 
the fourth inning. Fifteen UCSD 
players batted in the inning as the 
Tritons notched 10 hits and 10 
runs in the frame. Clark had a 
two-run single with the bases 
loaded early in the inning before 
adding another bases-loaded sin-
gle with two outs later to score 
two more. Junior third baseman 
Alex Gascon had a big three-run 
double in the inning as well. 

Gascon went three-far-four 
with four RBI and two runs 
scored. He doubled twice. Senior 
catcher Jeff Riddle was the third 
Triton with three hits, as he went 
3-of-4 with [wo doubles, two runs 
and an RBI. Junior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez, senior first baseman 
Keith Albrecht and junior desig-
nated hitter Josh Saunders added 
two hits apiece. Langone, 
Hernandez, Albrecht, Saunders 
and senior center fielder Brett 
Burton all scored two runs each. 

In game [WO of the series on 
Feb. 27, Cal Poly Pomona pitcher 
Efran Lira threw a [Wo-hit com-
plete game and struck out 14 
UCSD batters. 

UCSD sophomore hurler Jose 
Navarro gave up just one run 
through four innings. In relief, 
junior pitcher Jus~n Allred went 
three innings and gave up [WO 
runs in the bottom of the eighth 
inning. With the loss, Allred falls 
to 2-2 on the season. 

In game one of the series on 
Feb. 26, UCSD sophomore 
pitcher Byron Grubman threw 
his second complete game of the 
year. Grubman allowed just five 
hits without walking a batter, 
while striking out sev~n . Similar 
to his previous nine-inning 

effort, in which he retired the 
final 19 batters in order after 
allowing a single third-innin~ 
run, he finished strong, getting 
10 succp.ssi ve au ts to sh u t the 
Broncos down. He improved to 
2-1 on the year, while Bronco 
pitcher Jose Munoz suffered his 
first defeat, falling to 3- 1. 

Offensively, Riddle smacked a 
two-run home run, which 
accounted for UCSO's final pair 
in the seventh inning. The 
homer was his team-leading 
third of 2004. 

Langone, Clark, Gascon and 
Albrecht each had a pair of hits 
for UCSO. Both of Langone's 
hits were doubles for a team-best 
eight on the year. Gascon s two-
run single in a three-run sixth 
inning gave UCSD the lead for 
good. 

After the weekend series, 
UCSO took on Division I cross-
town rival University of San 
Diego on March 2. The Tritons 
tied the ballgame with three runs 
in the top of the seventh, but 
USD put up four runs in the 
bottom of the seventh inning to 
earn the victory, 7-3. 

For UCSD, Hernandez fin -
ished a perfect 4-for-4, including 
a double and two RBI. 

UCSD jumps back into CCAA 
action with a four-game series 
against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills March 4 through March 6. 
The Tritons and Taros will playa 
pair of single games at 2:30 p.m. 
at Triton .Baseball Stadium on 
March 4 and March S. T he teams 
will then head to Carson, Calif. 
for a noon doubleheader at Toro 
Field on March 6.

Water polo: Tobi Lyman scores four goals 
continued from page 16 

four. Lyman, a transfer from UC 
Irvine, now has 21 goals on the 
season and is looking more and 
more like a smart pickup on 
Sanders' part. Senior two-meter 
defender Meris Bantilan-Smith 
continued her role as team 
Iynchpin, adding three goals of 
her own to the effort. 

The goal well ran dry against 
Stanford, however, as the Tritons 
undermined their own upset 
efforts in the 6-0 shutout. Scoring 
opportunities were abundant, but a 
hesitation in attacking led to failure 
in each UCSD trek up the pool. 
The Tritons drew six man-up 
opportunities, but a reluctance to 
shoot the ball allowed Stanford to 
sustain a tight position on each 
player. In comparison, the 
Cardinal converted thr~ of their 
six man-up opportunities, but only 
needed one to put the game away. 

"Everybody was waiting for 
someone else to [shoot) it, but no 
one was doing it. We're not hav-
ing that same fire, that killer 
instinct from last week," Sanders 
said. "Stanford went 3-for-6 on 
their man-ups, and typically a 
success rate like that will win you 
any game." 

The UCSD defense gave 
another persistent effort, holding 
the second-ranked Cardinals to a 
slim 3-0 margin at the half and, at 
six goals, topped by Hannah 
Luber's three, tied Stanford's low-
est output for a game this season. 
However, without an offensive 
attack to provide pressure, the 
Tritons could not crack the 
Cardinal lead. 

The hopes for victory rose as 
the Tritons faced off against San 
Jose State only. week after dis-

patching the Spartans in a victory 
thatlater proved to be the inspira-
tion for the Tritons 3-1 perfor-
mance at Davis. As in their previ-
ous meeting, the Tritons went 
down early, lacking the persistent 
attack that kept the Spartans 
c1o$e. San Jose State, Unchecked, 
cruised out to an 8-2 advantage by 
the fourth quarter. 

The Tritons scored two goals in 
the fourth to briefly stir things up, 
but the Spartans'lead was Wlassail-
able. UCSD's drivers had most of 
the scoring luck, as juniors Jessica 
Wong and Jaemi Jackson and 
sophomore Jane Hashimawari 
converted from their spread posi-
tions while Bantilan-Smith con-
tributed a score. 

In a precarious position 
where a loss could have meant 
last place and a losing record, 
the Tritons had the luck of draw-
ing unranked Pacific. The 
Tigers were no patsies, but, cap-
italizing on the lessened pressure 
of a weak opponent, the Triton 
offense racked up six unan-
swered goals in the first half. 

Against Pacific, the two-meter 
offense continued its success 
against unranked opponents, who 
provided an opportunity for the 
inexperienced duo of senior 
Lesha Bounds and freshman 
Natalie Hockett to polish their 
skills in a relaxed environment. 

Bounds led UCSD scoring 
with three goals, a tally bolstered 
hy a pair from Lyman. This 
game was reminiscent of an 18-1 
win earlier in the season against 
unranked Marist College, where 
the Tritons, struggling at the 
.Michigan Invitational, loosened 
up and restored some of their 
confidence. 

As sweet as the drought-end-
ing win was, however, the 6-2 
success over UC Irvine was a 
redemption for a weekend in 
shambles. 

Fittingly, it was the former 
Anteater, Lyman, who led the 
charge, hitting twO goals, match-
ing a deuce frnm Banti lan-Smith. · 
Hockett and Hasi mawari each 
tallied one to add to the scoring 
fray, highlighted by a six-goal sec-
ond half. 

The Anteater:; made UCSD 
earn the victory, however, battling 
the Tritons to a I - I deadlock at 
the half. But in the third quarter, 
UCSO's offense suddenly kicked 
into gear, lighting up the score-
board with three unanswered 
goals to finish off UC Irvine. 

"This gave us an opportunity 
... to learn. We controlled the 
game, played both offense and 
defense, and sent us home on a 
positive note," Sanders said. 

Throughout the season, the 
UCSD squad has grappled with 
the inconsistencies on offense 
with an open mind, adapting 
their game as part of what 
Sanders calls "the learning 
process." But looking ahead to an 
anticipated rematch against con-
ference foe Loyola Marymount, 
part of a three-way mini tourna-
ment with Claremont College on 
March 6 at Canyonview Pool, 
the Tritons know that they must 
play with tenacity or risk another 
blowout at the hands of the 
Lions. 

"We're still adjusting but 
we're not being consistent on 
offense," Sanders said. "It's frus-
trating to the girls, they were 
starting to learn how to win last 
week. They want to win."

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Bonds undeserving of negative image 
Perfonnance enhancer problems are pe.nnanent 

Granted ... 
Matthew Grant 

Major League Baseball records will a Iways be scarred with an asterisk 
next to Barry Bonds' 73"home run 
record. There is no doubt in my 
mind that Bonds is juiced, but the 
degree to which performance-
enhancing drugs have affected 
baseball is debatable. 

Bonds-ha ters will point out 
that Barry never came close to 73 
home runs before 2002. They 3I'e 
right. In fact, that's the only season 
that he ever hit more than 50 
home runs . He's only led the 
league in homers twice in his 
career. 

Yet Bonds remains the center 
of the drug controversy in MLB 
because he has the record . He is 
the king of the hill and someone 
has to tear him down somehow. 
The problem for future genera-
tions of baseball players will be 

how to do that. There is serious 
talk of banning substances like 
Zinc Monomethionine Aspartate, 
the supplement that Bonds has 
been using for several years, but 
what effect will that have on the 
game' Let's look at what would 
happen if MLB were to ban the 
substance and begin testing play-
ers for it immediately, and what 
the punishments would be if the 
players tested positive. 

MLB cannot and will not pun-
ish for past offenses, so players who 
have been using would have to 
stop. but they'd still have reaped 
virtually all the benefits. Then. the 
players who are forced to stOP 
using will go to a nutritionist and 
will begin a regimen of new supple-
ments that are still completely 
legitimate. When MLB sees the 
problem with the new drugs, they 
will be banned, and the players will 
go through the process again. 
Lather, rinse, repeat. 

Science will always have the 
edge on sports in the field of med-
icine; the sooner that this is under-
stood, the sooner a feasible solu-
tion can be established. It will not 
rely on drug tests or investigations 
to figure out what the next big 

performance enhancer will be; the 
best solution will be integrity. 
Integrate a clause into the baseball 
union that forbids the use of 
unnatural, performance-enhanc-
ing supplements. Force the guilty 
player or players and the club as a 
whote to suffer severe repercus-
sions for violations of the code. 
This should promote players and 
other staff to actively prevent con-
troversial substance abuse while 
maintaining integrity in the game. 
If action like this is not taken, it 
can be assumed that, in the future, 
records will not last more than a 
few years before being shanered 
by the next big drug (user). 

Back to Bonds: It might not be 
fair, but he is not the guy to hassle 
about it. He has established him-
self as a great player because he is 
a talented hitter. He knows what 
pitch is corning and how to hit it. 
He is still the only player to have 
400 home runs and steals in his 
career. He is still one of the unde-
niably greatest players to grace the 
field.

Tennis: Tritons suffer first loss to USF 
continued from page 16 

They are very strong, but we were 
able to get a couple of close sin-
gles sets off of them," LaPlante 
said. "We knew going in that this 
would be our first tough opponent 
and we should have definitely won 
some of the matches - but we 
realize that in order to win we 
need to play the points longer and 
smarter than [the way we did] 
against the teams that we've seen 
during the season." 

UCSD had three close, three-
set matches that didn't go its 
way. No.4 singles Hilker played 
one of her best matches all sea-
son. Hilker split sets with her 
opponent, losing the first one, 6-
0, and winning the second, 6-1, 
but in the third set, both girls 
played selidly and it came to a 
10-8 tiebreaker for the match to 
end. 

The highlight of the entire 
match was at No.5 singles, when 
senior Kristina Jansen battled 
back after losing the first set and 
being down 5-2 in the second to 
win it 7-5 and force her opponent 
into a third set. Because the final 
rcam score had already been 
decided by then, the match came 
down to a super-tiebreaker 
instead of the third match, which 
Jansen lost 10-8. 

"Kristina played really hard 
that match; even though she faced 
two match points. she was able to 
come back and raUy from being 

down 2-5 and force that third 
set," LaPlante said. "Overall, 
although disappointing not to win 
a match, it was good competition 
to get us ready for our more 
important Division II matches 
coming up. I'm very pleased over-
all' with how everyone is playing, 
and hopefully all these tough 
matches will pay .off over the 
course of the season." 

The day before, on Feb. 28, 
the Tritons were able to showcase 
their talent in an impressive win 
against San Francisco State 
University. The team did not lose 
a single set, and Westerman and 
Dao beat their opponents, 8-6, at 
No. 1 doubles. No. 2 doubles 
sophomore Tara Siddiqui and 
freshman Kristin Bronowicki and 
No. 3 doubles Roberts and 
McKee both defeated their oppo-
nents, 8-1.

Points: TV Poker draws an audience 
continued from page 16 

Initially, poker seems perfect-
ly fit for ESPN2 - it's not much 
of a sport, kind of like a spell ing 
bee competition that once in a 
while finds its time on the tube, 
but for some reason, people will 
end up watching a couple of guys 
behind a pair of Oakleys play 
cards and the viewers will argue 
that it's only a game of luck and 
shouldn't be on Tv. 

However, poker does have its 
ties to the sports world . It's hard 
to liken a poker game to baseball 
(a lthough you could make a 
stretch and say the dealer is the 
one pitching the cards and the 
betters take their hacks at the 
plate), but a card game is a form 
of competition. When you sit 
down at a table, you want to take 

down the guy who can barely 
reach over his stack of chips just 
as badly as Mike Piazza wants to 
go yard on a Roger Clemens fast-
ball. 

"Baseball is like a poker game," 
Jackie Robinson once said. 
"Nobody wants to quit when he's 
losing. Nobody wants you to quit 
when you're ahead." 

A guy might double his 
money at his first sitting at a 
poker game, but it takes more 
than just the luck of the draw to 
win consistently. As Matt Damon 
says in the movie "Rounders," 
"People insist on calling it luck," 
and it's not completely a luck 
game. Other than the two cards 
you possess in your hold'em 
hand , factors like position, your 
opponents' betting styles and 

bluffing are just as important in a 
poker game as the ace you're 
holding. Poker is gambling 
(which is why Pete Rose is prob-
ably a pretty good poker player), 
but knowledge of the game will 
reduce the amount of luck neces-
sary and result in winning more 
often than losing. 

I don't know if the poker phe-
nomenon will hang around for a 
while or if people will get bored of 
it like any trend, But as long as it's 
here, people will continually 
debate whether it belongs on TV 
and if it's a game of luck or skill. 
And as long as it's here, just deal 
me in .

Names College, with rounds of 291 
and 316, scored a 607, just eked Out 
a lead over the Tritons and tied for 
fourth place. 

"We're trying to round out our 
schedule. We were the only 
Division IT team at this tourna-
ment," Wydra said. "It's probably 
not as inspiring an event as our reg-
ular tournaments, but it's always 
important to keep sharp for our 
tournament coming up [on March 
8 and March 9]." 

Individually, UCSD was led by 
Family Motors Invitational cham-
pion Brian Duckworth. The 
junior ace had rounds of 72 and 
76, giving him a total of 148, six 
over par, and a tie for ninth place 
overall . 

Sophomore Justin Grant, also 
coming off a solid performance at 
the Family Motors Invitational, 
placed second for the Tritons. He 
shot rounds of76 and 75, for a total 

of 151, nine over par, and a tie for 
19th in the tournament. 

Sophomore Robbi e Kramer 
fell two strokes behind Grant to 
take third for UCSD, with rounds 
of 80 and 73. His total of 153, 11 
over par, gave him a tie for 28th 
place. 

Senior Alan Scheer took the

the UCSD squad, putting in 
rounds of 82 and 79. He had a total 
of 156, 14 over par, and tied for 
54th place at the tournament. 

"I won't say the greens were 
'unfair,' though many other coach-
es have," Wydra said. "I think the 
guys were disappointed in the qual -
ity and condition of the course, but 
this tournament does help us solid-
ify our first and second squads for 
our tournament." 

The Tritons played on March I 
and March 2 at the Cal State San 
Marcos Invitational, but complete 
results of the tournament were 
unavailable at press time. UCSD

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I CLUB-SPOrn 
Sid and snowboard 

Members of the UCSD ski and 
snowboard team competed in a 

California regional ski race 
this past weekend at the 
Sugar bowl Resort in Lake 

Tahoe, Calif. Currently 
ranked second in the 

Southern California 
Collegiate 
Snowsport 
Conference, UCSD 

qualified as a ski 
team for the 

event. The 
honor allotted 

the team five spaces in 
each men's and women's skiing 
competition. Northern California 
does not have a platfonn for snow-
board competition, which resulted 
in no regional competition for the 
snowboard team. Schools in atten-
dance included Sierra Nevada 
College, Sierra College, UC 
Berkeley and UC Davis. SCCSC 
qualifying members included 
UCSD, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA 
and the University of Southern 
California. There were a total of 
64 racers from these schools who 
qualified to compete. 

The slalom competition was the 
bread and butter of the Triton 
women's team. Senior racer 
Danielle Crockett placed ninth 
overall, followed by skiers Katie 
Wurden and Brooke Mosley. 
Freshman Anja Smith fell during 
competition while on pace for a 
fourth--place finish. The men's 
team followed sophomore Jake 
Cohen placing 22nd. Patrick 
Wilcox and Adam Crocker finished 
in the middle of the pack. 
Sophomore racer Evan Sharbrough 
was disqualified in competition 
while leading UCSD's team. 

Crockett, Wurden and Mosley 
represented UCSD in the giant 
slalom- competition on Feb. 22. 
Crockett finished ninth for a sec-
ond time while Wurden and 
Mosley finished in the middle. The 
men's team showed well with 
Sharbrough finishing 19th, fol-
lowed by Cohen at 21st 

The team's next scheduled com-
petition will tak.e place March 13 
and March 14 at Mammoth 
Mountain in Mammoth Lakes

team will next be in action on March 13 
and March 14 in Santa Barbara, Calif. 
skies and strong, steady 10 to 15 
knot winds greeted the 20 teams on 
Jan. 31. 

Day one was a bit tough for 
UCSD, who placed ahead of rival 
UCLA bur in 10th place over all. 
On day two, Sean Anderson 
rebounded, taking first place in the 
B division. His performance, cou-
pled with fresbmanJeff Simon's A-
division score, put UCSD in fifth 
place ahead of both Stanford and 
UCLA. The women's team, led by 
Heather Martinelli, also made a 
mark coming in 14th on day one 
and 13th on day two. 

The sailing team then traveled 
north to UC Berkeley to compete 
in the first and second regattas of 
the North Series, with UCSD plac-
ing seventh and ninth, respectively. 
Conditions were tough but the 
team made a good showing on UC 
Berkeley's turf and looks forward to 
following up its defeat to the 
Golden Bears at Fall 
Championships with another at the 
Pacific Coast Championships in 
the spring. . 

The third and fourth regattas of 
the South Series took place two 
weelts ago in Los Angeles.' Fickle 
winds, shon courses and lots of rain 
made for mentally and physically 
challenging sailing conditions at 
the UCLA-hosted event. Despite 
tough conditions, the team man-
aged to tie with UCLA on Feb. 21, 
placing eighth overall. With slight-
ly better winds and an alumni 
cheering section, UCSD beat 
UCLA. The overall positions have 
yet to be announced.

UCSD baseball drops three of its last five games 
No. 21 Tritons split four against Cal Poly Pomona, fall to USD

In a jam: Senior rightfielder David Hawk takes a hack at a pitch from Cal Poly 
Pomona's James Valicentt In the sixth inning of UCSD's 15-5 victory on Feb. 28. 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
met California Collegiate 
Athletic Association foe Cal 
Poly Pomona in league action 
Feb. 26 through Feb. 29. The 
Tritons took game one of the 
series, 5 -1, while the Broncos 
inched out the victory in game 
two, 3-\. In the twin bill on Feb. 
28, UCSD put up 10 runs in the 
fourth inning and routed the 
Broncos, 15-5 . The second 
game of the nightcap was sus-
pended due to darkness and was 
later completed with the 
Broncos earning the victory, 4-
2. On March 2, the Tritons suf-
fered a 7-3 loss to University of 
San Diego. 

"We're a good baseball team, 
but it's time for this group to step 
up, to make the decision that they 
are not going to be outplayed 
anymore," UCSD head coach 
Dan O'Brien said. "I know they 

have it in them." 
Including the weekend series 

and the game against USD on 
March 2, the Tritons are now 12-
8 overall, 5-5 in the CCAA. 

Triton junior hurler Logan 
Boutilier took the hill for UCSD 
in game three. Boutilier went 
seven innings and improved to a 
perfect 4-0 on the year. 

UCSD junior second baseman 
Joel Clark proved to be a solid 
force in the Triton offensive 
scheme. In the opener of the dou-
bleheader on Feb. 28, Clark fin-
ished 3-for-6 with a double, one 
run scored and seven RBI, includ-
ing five in the 10-run fourth . 

"Joel understands what it takes 
to be successful ," O'Brien said. 
"He's a winner, and his leadership 
between the lines will make oth-
ers around him better."

Women's tennis knocks ·off Villanova, 8-1 
Tritons rebound from loss to San Francisco to beat Division I Wildcats 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team came off its first loss of the 
season to defeat Division I 
Villanova in a decisive 8-1 victory 
at UCSD's Northview Tennis 
Courts on March 2. The win 
brings the Triton's record up to 7-1 
overall. 

"The goal of today's match was 
to play soml! good doubles," 
UCSD head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. "We made a couple of adjust-
ments today due to some class con-
flicts with some of our own players, 
but we still played very well over-
all. " 

The fairly one-sided match 
showcased some of UCSD's best 
tennis played all season. At No.6, 
UCSD freshman Katie McKee was 
finally given her first real test of 
skill and was able to aggressively 
outmaneuver her opponent to a 
win (6-4 and 6-3). 

At No. 1 doubles, Tritons 
senior Julie Westerman and junior 
Jasmin Dao defeated their oppo-
nents in a quick 8-1 match, and 
sisters Allison and J enna Ishii 
defeated their Villanova oppo-
nents, 8-4, at the No. 2 position. 
At No.3, sophomore Leigh 
Roberts and McKee teamed up to 
defeat their opponents, 8-2. 

As for the singles lineup, the 
Tritons were able to defeat 
Villanova pretty easily. No. 2 Dao 

and No.3 Roberts were both able 
to blank their opponents, 6-0 and 
6-0. Westerman swiftly defeated 
her Wildcat counterpart (6-3 and 
6-2) at No. 1 and sophomore 
Marissa Hilker was able to pullout 
a quick victory (6-1 and 6-1) at No. 
4 singles. 

Next up, the Tritons will host 
main rival Cal Poly Pomona on 
March 6 at noon at the Northview 
Tennis Courts. 

"The season so far has been 
getting us mentally prepared to 
play tough teams like Pomona. 
We know that they've lost a cou-
ple of top players this year from 
transferring and graduating, so we 
have a good idea of what their 
lineup is like," LaPlante said. 
"We've had some tougher match-
es and we know that we need to 
work harder and stay mentally 
focused to win points. This 
Saturday we really want a decisive 
win." 

On Feb. 29, the Tritons headed 
north to playa tough University of 
San Francisco team, coached by 
one of LaPlante's former players. 
This was the first real test for the 
Tritons, and they were handed 
their first loss of the season in a 
match where the final score (7-0) 
did not reflect the level of play on 
the courts. 

"The University of San 
Francisco is a Division I school.

Women's water polo finishes 13th at UCSB tourney

The No. 15 UCSD women's 
water polo squad started of the 
UC Santa Barbara Gaucho 
Invitational by dropping its first 
two games to No.2 Stanford, 6-
0, and No. 12 San Jose State, 8-
4, on Feb. 28. The Tritons made 
one of their trademark turn-
arounds on Feb. 29, regaining 
their composure with an 8-1 vic-
tory over unranked University of 
Pacific and then sparking a five-
point second half en route to a 

more meaningful 6-2 win over 
No. 12 UC Irvine and a 13th 
place finish in the tournament. 

The 2-2 performance was the 
latest in a string of up-and-down 
performances for the 8-10 
Tritons, who, after a 3~1 showing 
at the UC Davis Shootout, looked 
to finally break the inconsistency 
jinx. 

"We weren't mentally ready 
against Stanford and San Jose 
State. It's the same issues as 
before, being able to come out 
and play to win," UCSD head 
coach Larry Sanden said. 

Despite being 18 games deep 
. in the season, this young UCSD 
squad is still having trouble bring-
ing a consistent, aggressive 
offense to the table. The offensive 
performance in Santa Barbara, 
Calif., underlined by an 0-for-16 
shooting performance against 
Stanford, was a faded memory of 
the team that took second place at 
UC Davis. 

But nine Thtons picked up at 
least one goal this weekend, led 
by junior driver Tobi Lyman's

Recently, people's favorite phrases have gradually changed from "You've got 
mail" and "That's my Fnal answer" 
to "All in" (with the hand gesture, 
of cOllr e). 

It eems as though you can't 
cross the street without overhear-
ing someone else's conversation 
about the Texas hold't:m hand that 
he held the night before. Poker ha 
moved into people's social lives 
(and for some, their protes ional 
ones, too) just like steroids move 
through a Major League Baseball 
locker room. 

The blitz of the poker popu-
larity must be attributed to the 
2003 World Series of Poker, 
which found airtime between the 
Killerspin Extreme . Table Tennis 
Championships and the World's 
Strongest Man competition on

Aztec Battle

Duckworth 
finishes four 

over par, ties for 
ninth place

The UCSD golf team compet-
ed in the San Diego State-hosted 
Aztec Battle at the Lake on Feb. 28 
and Feb. 29, at Lake San Marcos 
Country Club, placing sixth in a 
field of 12 teams. 

The Tritons shot rounds of 307 
and 30 I, giving them a total of 608, 
40 over par. Unlike most of their 
tournaments, which usually are 
composed of three rounds of golf, 
this was a two-round event . 

"This was an interesting 
course ful1 .of extremely fast 
greens," UCSD head coach Mike 
Wydra said. "They were actual1y 
doctored up to try to prevent 
overly low scores, so they were on 
tops of little hills for example. 
One very good player from [Cal 
State] San Marcos actually six-
putted a hole, something that you 
don't see mu.:h of."
