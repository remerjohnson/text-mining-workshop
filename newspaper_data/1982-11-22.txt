AS and TGs: a 
ping-pong game 

Beer at TGs. In years past, theAS has stood firm on 
the i sue. dissent silenced by the fact that TGs are the 
only significant social event at UCSD, a campus 
surrounded by hostile millionaires and infamous for 
iL supposedly dolti. h, egghead environment. 

Now the AS is hedging its bets, sq uirming under 
administration pres ure and s uffering a paranoia 
usually re erved for aged pensiuners in the slums. 
Legal ambiguity ha always surrounded alcohol on 
college campuses. Hi torically. punish~ent has. been 
token wrist-slapping. The fearful, tndent cfle of 
"Danger, Danger" have always been taken in tride; 
cool, pro- tudent voice prevailing. 

Members of thi year's student government, 
however, seem too timid and uninitiated to tand up 
for what tudent really want. Rhetoric and terror are 
the order of the day, chilling council meetings and 
ob curing the real i sue of u ing , tudent-provided 
fund for the good of those same student:. 

The A is not paid to ponder legal questions. The 
A wa not created to tell students \\ hat to do. The 
A 's sole function is to tran, late the \-vill of the 
st udent~ into policy and t'nsure that those policies are 
carried UlIt as far and a~ long as pOSSIble 

The most disgust ing a~pect of the AS's treat ment of 
TGs i~ the fact t hat it has degeneratt'cl into a 
backbit ing, rhetorical ping-pong game bet ween a few 
members uf the Council. 

The AS\; masturbatorv cowardice IS intolerable. If 
it is unablE' to perform ib dutle.., . II should be 
dIsbanded, al1o\\'ingstuclents full clio..;cretton o\'er Ihe 
monies the\' nu\,,' funnel mto ih coffers , 'I he funeral 
would he "short and ..,parsely attended, and I he 
gamesters could hang out at Denny \ and nanwcall

The answer is simple: There 
is no poSSIble way that any 
event can be programmed, or 
any service provided using AS 
funds that will at once satisfy 
a majority of the .:;tudents 
here. Instead, the logical 
course is to fund manysmalJer 
events and sen ices as 
possible. each one serving a 
smaller audience. ]f equity is 
maintatned in thIS annual 
fundmg, much more than a 
majority of students should be 
touched in sume positl\ e way 
by t he funds that t her entrusl 
to the AS.

Pacifk Nc"'" Scrvil~e 

When I first arrived in the 
United tates - it was in 
Washington , D.C. in th mid-
1960s - one of my st rongest 
impressions was of having 
suddenly become transparent , 
invisible. 

While walking on thestreets 
of Pans. or anywhere in 
France, one is l'xposl:'d 
Ince"'sent h to looks of 
curiOSIty, appreCIatIOn or 
critICIsm. The eve contact 
game is e<,peci,illy acti\<e 
bet \\e~n men and women: It is 
a \\ iI\ t hat men reas,ess theIr 
"maleness" there. and women 
theIr "femaleness" SonH"

{)\l'rexposed, want1llg 10 hide. 
Bul It IS eXCltillg, tm. thIS 
permanenl exchange \\ hich 
creates a )..,'lealer a\\ an'ness of 
the sexual polartt~ of human 
b.:ing' 

[ f!lund none of Ihat in 
America. On the conlrar\'. 11 
was a, t hough bot h sexes 
Ignor(.'<l each 01 her and applted 
Ihe ..,Iogan, " I mind mv 
bus1lless< vou m1l1d \ ours," 10 
all tnterac·tlon. It meant more 
freedom. certain ly, bUI also 
more loneltnes<, and more 
dullness. The world 'ieemed 
harder, indIfferent - and 
somehO\\ asexual. 

At the cockl at! parlle'i the 
East C oasl is so fond of. ot her 
phenomenon appeared. After 
the usual Introducl ion.., and 
slllall talk. men dnfted to one 
... idt' of t he room, women to the 
other. I felt In a no man\ land. 
unable to rel<lte 10 either ... ide. 

I )un ng one of t he pan it's. as 
I talked til a young woman. a 
man came o\cr and after a few 
poitle questIons underlook to 
e\pl<l1ll In ledlous cktatl the 
bustn('ss of the tire compam 
he wor keel for. I ret reat (:'(1. hu I I

at Il:'ast tryingto make contact 
and t hat he reali, didn't know 
how to do It. Each time such 
meet mgs occurred. I sensL'<l 
that a terrific effort was put 
forward. But there \\ as no 
excitement. Rather, tlwre \\a.., 
a sense of dut~ to the 
approach, 

Of course this happens 10 
Franc' as well. Somet imes t w() 
p('oplc are sim ply not on the 
same wavelength. Yet in 
America it seemed to me that 
men and women were almost 
never on t he same wa ... elengt h, 
People met without real 
curiosity or d sire for potential 
discovery. As a result, each 
individual limIted the other to 
a presumed role, his or her 
social function, And as roles 
were pretty fixed and 
predictable, espeCIally In that 
period, there was little room 
left for innovatIOn or ~urprise. 

Indeed , I soon not ICed that 
most Amencans, mall:' and 
female, dldn't want to be 
surpnsed. Almost an~ thtng 
could happen If the world was 
sudden!) prO\ pel dIfferent 
from one's expectalion, The 
Importanl thing wa" to keep

A few H'ar" later. things

community . however. 
remains actively involved 
with the Center through an 
organization called the 
Friend of the International 
Center. The university-based 
taff and the Friends thus 

work together toward an 
international exchange of 
ideas and the better 
understanding of peoples and 
cultures throughout the world 

UCSD curenLly has about 
1.300 non · US citizen students, 
250·300 of whom are vi iting 
cholars (professor and po t-

doctoral students). The 
International Center helps 
these visiting st udent s and 
scholar through programs 
uch as American Engli h-in· 

Action (AEIA). and the Host 
Family Program where 
Americans help foreign 
students and scholars find 
permanent hou ing. 

The Friends support the 
American English -in-Action 
program by arranging a 
meeting between American 
volunteers and foreign 
students or their family 
members two to three hours 
per week to help them improve 
theIr language skill s. the 
tutors are requested to attend 
a semInar given by members of 
the UCSD Linguisti cs 
Department. 

The Friends also operate a 
small resale hop that offers 
bargain on everything from 
clothes to furnishings. The 
Host Family program helps 

those stu dent who do not have 
permanent hou ing by 
assigning an American family 
to pick up the foreign student 
at the airport. open their home 
to the student for a few day. 
and hel p him / her find 
permanent housing. 

The Friends al 0 span or

American and foreign women

International Center. Cospon-
sored by the Ocean ids (lhe 
Women's Organization of 
UCSD). the "hour" extends 
from 10 - 12 noon every 
Wedne. day. and is attended by 
about 30-40 women and 
children each week. 

The four students living 
above the Center help Dhooges 
plan activities and events for 
the lnternaional Clu b which 
consists of foreign student 
and EAP returnees. American 
student may join by paying 
$3. Typically. there are one to 
I wo excursions per quarter 
(e.g. to the San Diego Zoo or 
the Wild Animal Park). some 
ethnic dinners, and an 
educatIonal lecture series.

The International Center 
work closely with the 
Language House (Beagle Hall 
on the Revelle campus). and 
refer foreign students and 
EAP returnee s to the 
"language tables." which are 
held every Thursday from 
5:30-6:30 pm in the Revelle 
Deli. Prospective EAP 
applicants are urged to attend 
the language tables. as well as 
to participate in International 
Clu b activities in order to 
better acquint themselves 
with prospective ho s t

UCSD sends about 80 to 100 
Americans abroad every year, 
most through EAP. This is a 
nine-month study program 
allowing students to attend a 
university in a foreign country 
while earning UC credit. It 
costs slightly more than 
attending school on a UC 
campus (about $8.000. incl. 
round·trip transportation). 
however. financial aid IS 
available. Students must have

10 The UCSD Guardian Munday, NII\'cmber 22, 1982 

AS meeting: massacre film footage considered 
continued from page 5 
College Representative, 
immediately stated, "J heartily 
object to uSing A funds to 
fund what is bound to be a very 
biased viewpoint. '\.. 

External Affairs Commls' 
sioner Lisa tenmark argued , 
"This IS a very IInportanL 
issue that will probably never 
be resolved .. .I certainlv don't 
think anyone is going to stand 
up and say 'look at what the 
jews did ' .. If you try not to fund 
them ... what you're doing is, 
vou are supressing speech 
before the fact. which is not 
on ly unconstitutional. but it's 
Immoral and unethIcal." 

Muir College Represent atlve 
' teven Freidman called for 

"equal representatIOn by the 
jewish community and the 
Lebanese communlt \,," and 
stated, " ... to me, a loi of their 
papers (lI£'lI' illdica/or) have 
been biased, antije\\ish , anti· 
Israel. " 

Freidman offered an 
amendment to Anderson's 
motion which would put the 
screening under ledia Board 
sponsorship and would allow 
that he, FreIdman, oversee the 
event. 

Da ve Goodman, Lobby 
Annex co·d ireclor. reminded 
the council of t he recent rally 
at UCLA to protest the 
massacres which resulted in 
immenselvanti ·Semitic 
things (being shouted from the 

IX)C\ium )." (;(x)dman remar· 
ked, "The A. "houldn't fund 
that kInd of thing, v,:hich could 
easi I \' promot e \' iolence 
because it's such an emotional 
Issue. 

After a rat her heated debate, 
the mot IOn \\ a.., put to a vote 
and faIled - 5·4 with i 
abst enl IOns. 

Anderson later remarked, " I 
think the Council has been 
faced with really politically 
volat ill' issues ... t heir opinions 
were based on a concern of 
hearsay rumor (the UCLA 
rally) ... 1 think it would've been 
conducive 10 an explanation 
to allow some of thiS original 
IIlformalion to come out." 

AS PreSident Henry Chu 

said, "I think the bill was 
presented at too late a date, 
and too man\.' detaIls were not 
ans\\cred ... there areob\'iously 
a lot of politIcal implications 
and Lee (Anderson) didn't 
know enough about I I. The 
11£'1(' il/dim/o)' shou Id've be n 
here to answer qlle~llon.., 
(regardtng I he ..,creentng)." 
Chu "ent on lostate, '' It 'sslill 
wit hin I he re<llm of being 
shown here ... " 

Davenporl remarked " I 
can't. with a good conscience, 
fund somet hing t hat may

Guardian vs. Enquirer: 
Is there a difference? 

As a voca l member of the A Council. I am subjected to 
frequent scrutiny by the press. (Most notably the Guardian). In 
turn , the Guardian is assumed to be a responsible tabloid that 
report s facts and news in a man ner so as not to be misconstrued 
by its readers. This yea r 's Guardian, under thedirection of new 
editors, has choosen to defeat this assumption in a very 
irresponsible manner. This year, on several seperate occasions. 
the Guardian has incorrectly rCIX)rtl'<l and s nsationalized AS 
issues in which I have been directly involved. On Ihese 
occasions , Iht' differences between - the trulh and Ihe 
Guardian's account have been overwhelming. In issue ttl60n

B.B. Leone looks at real wild life on campus 
By ROBERT LEONE 

Two undays ago, while 
walking over to Muir East to 
see some of the finest football 
this side of the NFL playoff. or 
the next Charger~ or 4ger 
game, I took a long clbse look at 
the butterflie . And looked and 
looked and looked. ] mi ed 
two games looking at those 
butterflie . They are 
Monarch , winging their way 
to Mexico to pend the winter. 
While they are here, they seem 
to pend mo·t of t heir time

remind u" I hat t here IS mort' to

bnulll, parllal IractlOns, and 
Alexander Pope's Essl1\' Oil 
Mal/. They remind us of our 
mortality when we see one 
breathing It'S last on a cement 
sidewalk , and at the same 
time, they sbow us that they 
are more to be preserved (in 
life, for butterflies pinned to a 
CG:-~ aft: dejj,es~irlg), and inu 
show us the stat ement of 
Eugene Ionesco in a much bet· 
ter format than a simple writ· 
ten sentence. "Onlv the 
ephemeral is of lasting \;alue," 
Ionesco aid, and a butterfly is 
as close to ephemeral as I wish 
to ee. I don't want to see Ein-
steinium, Es·256, With a half· 
life laconically reported In my 
CRC book as ,. hort." Butterf-
lies add color and Itke to 
Revelle and Muir. They add a 
little fantasy to this campus. 

The squirrels t hat lurk (Can 
a squirrel seriously lurk? If 
you grow walnuts. the answer 
is yes) around Cluster add the 
same sort of exdtem nt to this 
campus. It is exciting when 
one of the liltl fools f1atten~

"men" in the paren t'hes is is 
sexist. The cats roamIng 
arou nd the apartments of 
Muir looking for a mouse or a 
handout. and the very mice 
(what few there are) them-
selves, add a little life In th!~ 
campus, to this school. 

All these animals create a 
picture of life in mot ion , and of 
joy in that motion . that no 
architecture now created can 
ever produce. There is nothing 
exactlv like it. 

The- graffiti on the wall of 
the P&L staircase has a close

N etters end season 
('onti nued from page 15 
The crowd was thegame, Without the crowd we lose," Chalk one 
up for the student body, 

There are some parallels between what is happening here and 
the situation at San Diego tate in 1973 when the Aztecs won the 
national championship. Peterson Gym (where Lh Aztecs play 
their home games)was filled wiLh exciLement every game and IL 
got to the point where it seemed nothing could go wrong, but the 
volleyball program suddenly fell apart the folowingyear a~ Head 
Coach Jack Henn left the program after the adminisLration 
refused to support the program in a sufficient manner. 

Too many "pats on the back" and not enough financial help 
was the cause, and a floundering team was the result . What a 
crime, considering the way Henn worked to build the program 
into a national champion, Here at UCSD, Doug Dannevik has 
stressed more than once t hat he is upset at the way the 
admini ·tration can close its eyes as it does and turn it s back on 
athletics here. Will hc leave UCSD if he receives a better offer? 
"There's no question about it ," i hi reply . Indeed, after this 
volleyball eason has concluded , Dannevik probably will receive 
some very nice offers because he knows how to produce a 
winner, Let 's hope the adminisLration can change iLS attitude 
before iL's too late. 

Tammy mit hits, the rest of the Triton watch, and the Cal tate Los Angeles player hacks 
the net during the match la, t Wednesday night. UCSD now gets ready forthe playoffs, held the 
first weekend in December, 

The Regionals begin tomorrow with UCSD earnings a bye as 
the 3rd ranked team 111 the nation. Their first mat ch will be 
played during the December 3·4 weekend against the winner of 
Lhe Augs burg-St. Catherine gamc.

rebounded well and had a key 
block. but the \ ictory was a 
team effort," said the Triton 
coach. 

If C D had ~ebou nded 
better. they probably would 
have had an ea ier victory, 
because the agehens 
reportedly got . econd and 
third opportunities on the 
offensive end. After the 
Triton jumped out to a 4-0 
lead. no team could pull away 
from the other. In fact. at 
halftime. the two squad. were 
deadlocked at 26. 

In the first fourteen mlOutes 
of t he second hal f. t he lead 
changed hands no le<;" than 'i IX 
tImes. Wit h six minutes left. 
the . agehens ...,tarted to COOlt' 
aiJ\e. and con\'iently. for them 

was leading 45-4~ when 
Pomona capitalized on three 
Triton turnovers to score eight 
unanswered points. WIth the 
crowd coming alive. and th 
momentum clearlv in I he 
Sagehens' favor. Coach Clock

Where!l Your Son or Daughter Going to Live Next Year? 
It's no secret that on-campus housing is getting 
more and more difficult to find, and the cost of 
dormitory living is skyrocketing. 

Are you looking for an alternative to expensive, 

campus controlled housing for the students in 
your family? Could a 2 bedroom, 1 Y2 bath 
townhouse within walking distance of the 
UCSD campus be the alternative you're looking 
for? 

If you answered yes to these questions, let me tell you more about just such a condo. 
It's located at 3193-A Evening Way in La Jo"a (just off Gilman Drive). The complex is 
beautifully kept and has two pools and jacuzzis, The condo itself has a patio and a 
balcony, a 2 car garage, laundry hook-ups, and a" kitchen appliances, including a 

microwave. 

PRICE:. ________ $126,000 
FINANCING: ___ 10% down, 30 year term and 10% for the first three years and 15% for 

the remaining 27 years, 
OR 

CONSIDER with 20% or more down, we will consider 30 year financing at 12%. 
THIS: _____ The purchase of this condo may result in some attractive tax advantages for you. 

For example, the interest expense could be deducted. 
Also, should you rent a room to some other student, substantial benefits may be 
derived from this as an income property. 
Consult your tax advisor for details.
