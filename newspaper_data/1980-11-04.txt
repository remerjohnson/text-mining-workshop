The final act of Repu blican 

Ronald Reagan 's bid for the 
presidency was played out 
before a crowd of nearly 
15,000 in a San Diego 
shopping plaza parking lot 
last night. 
. Arriving over two hours 
late from a previous 
campaign stop in Portland, 
Ore., Reagan repeatedly 
lashed out at President 
Jimmy Carter's fiscal 
policies, saying, "I think it's 
about time for economic f::.ir 
play for Americans." 

"We don't have inflation 
because you Ire living too 

well," Reagan said in 
response to Carter's 
statement to the contrary. 
"We have inflation because 
the government is living too 
well. " 

Reagan 's speech at the 
Fas hion Valley Shopping 
Mall followed an hour and a 
half performance by 
television's Osmond Family . 
Singer Carol Lawrence also 
performed several politically 
oriented numbers. 

Virtually every Republican 
running for local office was 
on hand to grab a share ofthe 
audience and media expos·

Four members of th an

w re arrested last night 
while protesting at Republi -
can president ial candidat 
Ron ald Reagan's election-ev 
appearance in Fa s hion 
Valley, 

DSP member Jon Bekk n 
was arrested prior to t he rally 
when h all gedly failed to 
produce indent ificat ion after 
police stopped to que tion 
him about an anti,Reagan 
po ter carried by a per. on 
standing near him, 

Scott K s ler. Diana 
Bullock and Charles Herzfeld 
were arrested during the 
rally when what t hey said 
was a pro-Reagan "provoca-
teur" allegedly attacked 
them as they tood in the 
crowd holding anti·Reagan 
banners, 

an Diego Police Depart · 
ment official refused to 
omm nt on the arre t , 

According to one D P 
member, the arre, t began 
about 4 pm when th group 
arrived at t he Fashion Valley 
Shopping Mall. 

As the group walked 
toward the rally. several 
police units stopped them and 
demanded that SDSP 
member Adrian Hoban 
surrender an ant i-Reagan 
po ter he wa carrying, The 
officer told Hobson the st ick 
on the ign was "dangerous" 
and ':too long," 

Bekken grabbed onto the 
sign , said witness Virgil 
Haxton, and let go after a 
minute" discus ion with a 
police officer, He then "for no 
reason" wa pushed face first 

onto the trunk of a police car. 
handcuffed and taken to a 
holding tank near I h rail , 
Haxton said, B kk n :ays he 
sust ained a cut and scratches 
on his arm during th arrest. 

Aft r his release from an 
Di go County Jail la t night, 
Bekken told Th e Daily 
Guardian that he had been 
held for about four hour ' in a 
small polic van. his hands 
handcuffed behind hi: back, 

A witness said that the van 
wa ' unsanitary; it contained 
urine and vomit of other

"There's no wa th y']) be

con:idering filing false arr st 
charges against t he police. 
and he believes he has a 
sufficient number of 
witnesses to support his 
story , 

Bekk n said pol ice at the

UC Student Lobby 
Editor: 

Given all th pre-elect ion, 
post debate campaign and 
media hype, only a hermit or 
a cretin could be unaware 
that today million s of 
Americans will go and voice 
their opinion ' at the only pool 
that really c unts_ 

T he crucia l question is. 
w il l you? Conve n tion al 
wi dom ha it t hat the older 
you are the more li kely you 
are to vote, t he corollary of 
whi h i that if you are in the 
18-24 age br acket you are ' 
leas t likely to vote. What that 
could mean i t hat older, 
mor e c;onservative voters 
who tend to favor things like 
the draft and minimizing 
environmental protections in 
order to exploit non -
renewable energy resources 
are more likely to have their 
sentiments heard by 
politicians. 

At lea s t , that 's the 
conventional wisdom . 

Last June, five s hort 
months ago , student s 
throughout California 
registered and voted in record 
numbers. The conventional 
wi s dom crowd wa s a 
surprised at this phenom-
enon as they were at the 
defeat of the "unbeatable" 
Proposition ·9. Students , of 
course, were a major factor in 
the defeat of Jarvis II. But the 
question remains. will they 
vote again? 

I am certainly not ~ing to 
contend that thi November's 
election offers t he most 
exciting menu of political 
choice, and i sues to choose 
from, bu t I do con tend it is 
s t ill imperative that tudent 
go out and vote. 

Why? From the perspect ive 
of someone who works to 
further s tudent concerns in 
the political arena . one thing 
is clear- the only clout 
students have in the larger 
polit ical arena i t he threat of 

th e i r vo t i ng in l a r ge 
numbers . Student do not 
contribu te la rg sums of 
money to cadidat es. T hey do 
not hold po~ i t i on s of power in 
society whereby they can 
influence th ir employ or 
corpora te collegues. They do 
not make T V commercials for 
politi ians. 

It i. a simple fact of 
political life that if s tudent s 
do not vote, t hey will be 
ignored . Whi le some may 
think being ignored by the 
Pre iden t and Congress is a. 
dream come true, I t me 
remind you of t he dangers of 
being taken for granted by 
stat e a nd 10 a l offi cia l . 
I ues p rtaining to hous ing, 
t he en vironm ent , nu clear 
power, affirm ative act ion, 
tudent financial aid and 

budgets for public higher 
edu cation will a ll be 
addressed by the California 
State Legi lature in the next 
year. 

County and local govern-
ment will decide policies on 
zoning . human services, 
growth and development as 
well a s other c ru ci al 
community concern . A 
student presence must be fel t 
if we believe we have a stake 
in the future of our 
communities. 

So the bott om line is this: 
those of us working in 
Sa cram e n to as st ud ent 
advocates need your s upport 
at the polls to be effective 
lobbyis t in t heStateCa pita J. 
Your vote to d ay wi ll 
determine a lot more than 
just which candidate wins 
w h at offi e or h ow a 
particu lar issue wi ll be 
resolved . Your vote will 
de te rm ine the extent to 
which decision makers will 
heed studen t concern s in the 
next two year '.

Things which have 
influenced my life 

By Don Voorhies 
Three mo ... ies . comically rude and rated " R," have 

influenced my life: National Lampoon's frenzied Animal 
House Cheech and Chong's enthu iastic Up in Smoke and 
Dan Akroyd and John Belushi's divine movie The Blues 
Brothers. These movies, like vis ions of wisdom, have 
inspired me with a model to follow and new goals to seek , 

I have been inspired by A nimal House, first, because of 
the character called Otter. From him I have learned the 
proper way to treat ladies and how to take advantage of 
people. 1 have been inspired by it , next, because of the 
character called Pinto. By his flaws I have learned the 
improper way to treat little girls and how not to be taken 
advantage of. I have been inspired by it, finally , because in 
the moVie I have seen , through the toga party and the 
rebell ion of Delta House, the vision of college that students 
have im38ined. This is what I have bee!l insp.ir~ by, and 
though it may seem too good for college hfe, thIS IS what -
at last - I have found. 

With equal influence I have been inspired byCheech and 
Chong's Up in Smoke. I have learned not to pick up female 
hitch-hikers with moustaches. r have learned not to smoke 
ajoint in the car with the windows rolled up. And I learned 
not to snort Ajax Cleanser. However, I am still confused as 
to why Ajax is different than any other cleanser. 

Animal House and Up in Smoke were both very 
influential. But it was The Blues Brothers that gave me a 
special goal. Strident sounds vibrate in my head_ 
Hyperactive punk rockers create ;;O';1nds they call mu~ic, 
radical rock-and-rollers cause bUlldmgs to ' tremble WIth 
their "heavy metal," red-necked hicks put a t~ang in mus~c 
that's only fit when sitting among cow patties. All of thIS 
noise that exists in the world today make a mockery of 
what music should be. I, like the ingenius Joliet Jake and 
Elwood Blues, am on a miss ion (rom God and have vowed to 
bring the blues back into the Iiv~ of t he people. . 

This has been a part of my hfe. I have found It to be 
exciting and hedonistic.

E d itor: 

Left-wing, r ight-wing, I 
don ' t care. Religion a nd 
politics s hould not in ix. 

Vicki Monks' article (Daily 
Guardian Oct. 30), points out 
how fractured this supposed-
ly unified bloc really is; even 
if they tried, e tens of 
million s of bo rn -again 
Christians couldn 't agr.ee on 
a coherent policy concerning, 
say, nuclear weapons, capital 
punis hment , foreign policy, 

gun con trol, ERA and gay 
right . Okay. !:)o th ese 
evangelicals really don't have 
a direct pipeline to a god who 
tells them how to make 
decisions, and they don't vote 
as if t h inki ng wi t h a s ingle 
mind. 

What scare the daylight 
out of me is, sometimes it 
seems they t hink they do. 

T hey. Okay, I've been. 
ca llin g C hr is t ia n s they. 
That ' s because I'm not oneof 
t hem. If you want to hand me 
a labe l, label me atheist. 

Atheist is an ugly word , and 
it's been spit out by many 
religious people as a w arning 
of what can go wrong wi t h 
your life if you don 't watch 
out. Any way. that's me. 
Atheist. 

All in a ll , I th i nk 
evangelists really do try to be 
humanitarians, and if many 
of them wan t to s top raping 
the Third World, end nucelar 
a rms, and want to help out 
human beings in general , 
t hen that's great. I probabl y 
would agree with them on 

man~ points_ 
It s th e poi n t s we' d 

d isagree on that bug me. 
Ever argue with a Bible-

t humper? J have, a couple of 
t imes. before I learned not to.

Thev have it. and I don 't . 
T hey ' re r igh t, a n d I' m

fact s. not mu ch. I don't have 
a direct link to my crea tor , 
and I can 't ask him , her, or it 
how to think. I've got to do all 
the thinking myself. 

Which brings up t he most 
dangerous aspect of evangeli -
cal s: they evangelize. They 
convert others to their faith . 
Non-believers are told to 
change their beliefs and ways 
of thinking, because not only 
are they wrong, they' re evil. 

What 's great about this 
country is that whatever 
your opin ions, off iciall y 
you' re tolerated. You ' re not 
told to change. In t h is kind of 
poli tica l sys t em , t here ' 
simply no room for religion, 
beca u se religion doe n't 
follow the ru les. 

If people want to be 
religious, that 's okay with 
me. Their beliefs don' t have 
to mat ch mine. T here' 
enough room for both of us. 

Just don 't tell me how to 
think. okay? 

PETER SHAW 

( Looking for the lifeboats 
BY DAVID RITCHIE 
I got two things to say . One 

is an answer to t he Question, 
"What is the logic of 
conversation?" The ot her is 
about a spectre on R~velle 
Plaza. 

r asked my friend to bring 
me some wine from LA. He 
said that r owe a duty to not 
run for a place in the lifeboat s 
of a s inking society . 
Conventionally, we are 
pleased to explain the 
nonsequitur by saying that 
there were thirteen hours 
between request and 
response , that chronology is 
the key; but of course there is 
no reason why segment of 
an un-scripted conversation 
should follow any logical 

sequence. Listen all around. 
What do you hear now? I 

hope you are embarrassed. 
not by the con tent, but by the 
delivery. We currently speak 
bad . j'-or all that the 
nonsequitur sounds real but 
ridiculous , it has at least one 
virtue: it neither repeats 
"like" time after time, nor 
s tumbles into a mumbled 
" you know what I mean." 

Now I see the spectre on 
Revelle Plaza. She IS a large-
chested matronly woman. 
She curls her hand throu~h 
tongue twisted, rhetorlc-
charged air . "Hreat he 
deeply," she cries, "you sons 
and daughter s of the 
Revolution. Speak out, speak 
uP. speak it in. Ring your 
lones; spatter 'sort ofs' as 

blood on the pavings. With 
round mouth and lightlv 
tripping tounge, now herald 
the gestatu:JO of a new UCSD 
rhetoric, t hat the spirit of t he 
Gettysburg Address may be 
born again." 
You may di s cover that 
dramatists, novelists. script 
writers have made a myth for 
you : it is the exceptional 
conversation that follows 
logic. In spite of this we are 
happy to pass words and 
phrases from one to another 
and call it conversation.

Reagan 
• 

campaIgn 
continued from page 1 
Tuesday. 

As a group behind the stage 
chanted "bull hit ," Reagan 
told how in t he Bronx he had 
faced a man, middle·aged, 
Black. "He wasn 't antagon· 
istic, but he said to me With 
the greate ·t longing in hi s 
voice, 'Can you tell me that I 
have any reason to hope that 
one day I can again take care 
of my family - rai e my 
children the way the should 
be raised .' " 

Reagan accused Carter of 
"hiding behind a dictionary" 
when differentiating be· 
tween a recession and a 
depression in the US . "A 
rece sion is when your 
neighbor loses his job. A 
depression is when you lose 
your job. And recovery is 
when Jimmy Carter lose his 
job." 

Reagan devoted the last 
part of his 40 minute speech 
to outlining the economic 
plans he woult institute if 
elected. He claimed he would 
balance the federal budget as 
early a 1983 and he proJllised 
to "take government off the 
back of industry" and allow it 
to do its "best job." 

Along with the deregula-
tion of industry, Reagan 
proposed a 30 percent income 
tax cut over the next three 
years and special tax credit 
for parents ending their 
children through college. 

Despite his other budget 

T uesd ay, November 4, 1980 

Republican Rona ld Reagan 

CUlling measure, Reagan 
declared t hat he would 
incre.ase federal spending for 
national defense "in order to 
in ure world peace." 

"I don't believe in the 
peacetime draft, " Reagan 
said, adding that a volunteer 
army "sufficient to protect 
the US" could be raised by 
"paying them on a scale 
commen s urate to the 
acrifice we're asking of 

them. " 
Reagan clo ed his San 

Diego vi sit - and his 
campaign - in the same 
manner he closed hi 
argument in the debate las t 
week . " ... 1 envision 
leadership as president as a 
leadersltip in taking 
government off your backs 
and turning you loose to do 
what I know you can do 
best. " 

Reagan 'extravaganza' shows 
., . . . prexy campaIgn s eccentrIcItIes 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
It was like the Fourth of 

July . Repu blican Ronald 
Reagan ended hi president · 
ial campaign in San Diego 
last night with a celebration 
in Fashion Valley. The 
grande finale included 
fireworks, a celebrity show 
and a gathering of nearly 
15,000 pro-Reagan San 
Diegans. 

Fireworks filled the ky 
as the crowed joined in 
inging the Nat ional 

Anthem. A large hot·air 
balloon was launched and 
searchlights criss-cros ed a 
stage adorned with clusters 
of red, white and blue 
balloons, American flags 
and po ters of Reagan . The 
show was et. 

The 0 mond Family 
performed after brief 
appearances of other 
celebrit ies, including Desi 
Arnez and Carol Lawrence. 
D nny and Marie dominat· 
ed the show, entertaining 
the audience for an hour 
and a half before Reagan 
arrived at about 7:15 pm . 
Donny aroused the crowd 
wit h his ver ion of "Go, 
Ronny, Go," ung to the 
tune of Chuck Berry' 
"Johnny B. Goode." 

The rally at! racted a 
variet y of interest groups. 
but most were Reagan 
supporters. More than 24 
bus loads of people Cam 
from as far as Los Angeles to 
allend the e\'cnt. Three 
high school bands attended 
at the im'itation of an 
Diego Ma~'()r Pete Wilson. 

The "Reagan Rowdies," a 
grou p of 170 women 
wearing Reagan visors with 
red blinking lights were on 
hand to " let him know we 
love him . " Another 
supporter claimed he 
showed up because he 
"wanted to see America's 
next president, because I 
probably won't be able to 
see him again." 

Other people showed up 
at the rally to express their 
discontent with the 
candidate. A handful of 
ERA protesters were 
scattered throughout the 
crowd. One woman from 
the National Organization 
for Women (NOW) was 
present "to s how my 
upport of Carter and my 

disenchantment with 
Reagan ." 

Reagan resisters from 
UCSD also brought a 
message to the rally. A one 
graduate student comment· 
ed: "We wanted him to see 
that t here are st ill people 
that won't vote for him." 

Still. many others came 
simply fort he excitement of 
the ev ent . A typical 
comment came from a 
woman who canfes ed, ''I'm 
a people-watcher, I just 
wanted to see the whole 
thing." Another youngman 
admitted. " I would just like 
to shake his hand .. . see what 
he looks like." 

The store manager from 
Robinson's said that the 
slOre was nearl~' empty and 
t hal many t'mploycc~ had 
taken "e:>.tendl:'d lunch 

breaks. " 
Some people were not at 

the rally for entertainment, 
however. Police and ecret 
Service official loomed 
over the area monitoring 
the crowd. A spokesman for 
the San Diego Police 
Department said they were 
there "to try to spot 
something before it 
happens." 

UCSD's Life Flight 
helicopter was al oon hand . 

The rally a rea was 
constructed to accomodate 
the media, wit h 50-foot light 
stands and a set of bleachers 
et near the stage. The 

national TV networks 
arrived ju st prior to 
Reagan' appearance and 
were allowed to 'et IlP their 
cameras on the stagt.'. 

Finally Reagan emerged 
as the band struck up, 
"California Here J orne." 
Ent husiasm surged as the 
candidate delivered his 
final me . sag , which 
focused large ly against 
excessive gO\' ernment 
intervention in the 
economy . He rhetorically 
asked. "Are yoU rcally 
better off than' you were 
four years ago?" Supporters 
replied. "No!" 

Reagan 's final bid (() San 
Diegans sugg-ested "taking 
government off your hacks 
and I urning you loo..;e to do 
\I'hat I kilO\\, \'ou can d(l 
best. " Sliddenh- a larg('

Bluegrass is so much a part of our musical heritage it's hard to bel ieve that 
its origins - even its name - can be traced back to one man. But it can. 
and Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys have been shaping, polishing, 
defining and redefining this vital musica l style ror over 40 yea r , They 
infused the Old Timey String Band mu ic orthe Appalachia with the best 
of the blues and created a sound that has come to examp li fy the pirit of 

rural America.
