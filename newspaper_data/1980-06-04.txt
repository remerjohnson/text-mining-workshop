Metzger Defeated, 
Prop 11 Loses, 
Gann, Cranston Win 

BY JEFF BERESFORD. HOWE 
Newt Editor 

Howard Jarvis's dream will not be the university's 
nightmare, California decided last night. Over 60 
percent of the state's voters rejected Proposition 9, 
ending, for all practical purposes, the pollibility of 
dramatic fee increases in the UC system next year. 

UC President David Saxon said last night he was 
"delighted and heartened" by the proposition's defeat. 
"In these economically troubling times, a majority of the 
voters of Califomia chose to forego personal gain in 
order to uphold the public interest and to protect the 
services that are important to them," he stated. 

Proposition 10, a landlord-sponsored "rent control" 
initiative, was crushed 66 percent to 34 percent. 

In the political primaries, Sen. Edward Kennedy 
defeated Jimmy Carter by six percent. Still, by the time 
the polls in this state closed last night, Carter had won 
enough delegates nationally to clinch the Democratic 
nomination. 

Ronald Reagan, who has already won the 
Republican nomination, tqok about 90 percent in his 
primary, and Paul Gann won the party's senatorial 
nomination. 

He will oppose incumbent Alan Cranston, who 
overwhelmingly won the Democratic nomination for th~ 
third time. 

A breakdown in San Diego's new voting system 
delayed returns, but at 1 :50 this -morning, with 79 
percent of the votes counted, Edward Skagen was 
4,000 votes ahead and claimed victory over Klu Klux 
Klan leader Tom Metzger in the 43rd congressional 
district. 

Metzger was ahead virtually the enti~e evening, and 
figures from the Riverside and Imperial County sections 
of the district are expected to tighten Skagen's victory 
margin. 

Skagen, who appeared downtown at Election Central 
late last night, attributed his close race against the KKK 
leader to "frustration with foreign policy ... people are 
saying that force and violence are legitimate foreign 
policy tools because they are so upset." 

Metzger, who campaigned as a small businessman, 
had said lest night that he would visit UCSD if elected in 
November. Metzger had said he would be willing to visit 
this campus before November if he were invited. 

He also said last night that he has no great quarrels 
with the UC system. However, the Klansman did note 
that he opposes funding for Third World Studies 
programs unless they "make certain to get across that 
these minority cultures are inferior." 

Metzger had also promised to introduce legislation if 
elected to eliminate all affirmative action programs. 
And, - the Klan leader said, he opposes current 
investigations into UCSD's affirmative action program. 

In other Presidential primaries across the nation, 
Kennedy defeated Carter in New Mexico, South 
Dakota and Rhode Island. In the West Virginia and 
Montana primaries, Carter took the lead over Kennedy. 
Kennedy will continue his Presidential race, even 
though the delegate count appears to have given Carter 
the nomination. 

Reagan, running unopposed and virtually certain of 
his nomination for the Republican party, won nine 
Republican primaries yesterday. 

Speakirig at a Los Angeles victory party last night, 
~eagan echoed Barry Goldwater, saying he hoped his 
victory will inaugurate "not a campaign but a crusade." 

There were few other elections surprises yesterday. 
Proposition 11, the "tax big oil" initiative, garnered only 
44 percent of the vote, and Proposition 8, a bond 
initiative that would help fund alternative energy 
research, appeared to be a narrow loser. 

Proposition 5 , which would protect the confidentiality 
of reporters' sources received 72 Percent of the vote, the 
lecond biggest winner in the election. Only Proposition 
7, which extends dis8Jter protection, got more votes.

nomination. 

In ernship Office 
Seeks AS Funds 

BY JENlFER WARREN 
AAociate Newt Editor 

The fate of at least one student service - the AS 
Internship Office - will be decided at tonight's AS 
meeting, when AS President Jeremy Charlton 
presents the 1980-81 Executive Budget for council 
aW!oval. 

The AS budget, very tight due to what AS officials 
say is the low amount of m_on~1. left over from this 
year, is expected to show significant cuts in several 
areas, including the Internship Office and SCURJ, an 
organization ~hat provides grants for undergraduate 
research. 

"No definite figures have been decided upon as of 
yet," Charlton said yesterday. However ASIO 
Director Jim Lofgren has "the feeling that the AS is 
considering giving the program from $3000 to 
$8,000," which would just cover operating costs. 

Lofgren has requested $17,000 from the AS, 
which gave the Internship Office $8,500 last year, 
thf; program's first year of operation. 

"We've come a long way in our first year," said 
Lofgren, "and we need $17,000 to operate at an 
optimum level of service." 

The Internship Office lias placed students in 
internships in the White House and on City Councils 
this year and Lofgren hopes to see the program 
expand to provide year· round internships in San 
Diego, Sacramento and Washington next year. 

"Ultimately, we'd like to go nation-wide and even 
international," says Lofgren. "Yel without AS 
funding we just can't do it." 

The AS aUotted the Internship Office $13,000 on 
the proposed budget presented at last week's council 
meeting, and Lofgren feels anything under that figure 
is "grossly inadequate." 

"The $3,000 to $8,000 the AS is discussing now 
would just cover our operating costs, which are quite 
low since we're a service organization," said Lofgren, 
adding that "the AS is not sure it wants to fund

"We try to simulate life in some

Like other mythic tales and ritual., 
the game allows its players to try out

Ramsey Clark Offers 
Self for Hostage Swap 

TEHRAN - Former US 
Attorney General Ramsey 
Clark yesterday told delegates 
to the "Crimes of America" 
conference in Iran he would 
offer himself as a hostage if it 
would speed the release of the 
53 Americans held captive 
since Nov. 4. He called the 
hostage. taking "understand· 
able" but wrong and urged 
that the deposed shah be put 
on trial . 

Others among the 10· 
member US delegation in 
Tehran said they would try to 
arrange meetings with Iranian 
revolutionary leader Ayatol· 
lah Ruhollah Khomeini and 
Iranian President Abolhassan 
Bani·Sadr. -Iranian Foreign 
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh 
said he would meet with Clark 
but "not 'enter into negotiations 
with him." 

One conference delegate -
A~ Mahmoud, director of the 
International Center of Legal 
Science in The Hague, 
Netherlands - said he had a 
message for Clark Irom the 
militants who took the 
hostages, but that it .only 
restated their demand that the 
shah be returned to Iran from 
exile in Egypt. 

Secretary 01 State Edmund 
S. Muskie said in Washington 
the United States was "neither 
secretly nor openly behind" 
the Americans' presence at the 
conference but would consider 
the outcome of their mission in

determining whether to press 
charges against them. The 
Justice Department has 
banned travel to Iran. 

Clark, an activist lawyer 
who served as attorney 
general under President 
Lyndon B. Johnson in the late 
1960s, told delegat es 
attending the Iranian 
government.sponsored con· 
ference: 

"I am so sure it is imperative 
that the hostages be released 
now, so important to the 
lulfillment of the Iranian 
revolution which it is 
damaging in a hundred ways, 
so important to the individual 
rights of the hostages and so 
important to peace on earth, 
that I offer today to take the 
place 01 any hostage if that will 
help resolve this tragic crisis. 

"Taking hostages uninvol· 
ved in the specific offenses for 
which you are concerned can't 
be justified in a country which 
wants to live in peace. The 
seizure of the hostages here is 
understandable In human 
terms. God knows it IS 
understandable, But it is not 
right." 

Clark said the US· backed 
shah's regime has "brutalized 
millions" and asked, "How 
many greater crimes does 
history reneet than the crimes 
of the Shah of Iran against the 
people of Iran?"

Soviets Making 
Diplomacy Move 

MOSCOW - The Soviet 
Union is pressing a campaign 
for continued dialogue with the 
United States and Western 
Europe aimed at moving 
toward what one Soviet 
commentator calls "a period of 
diplomacy after a period of 
a nti·diplomacy. " 

Western diplomats say 
renewed contacts In recent 
weeks have yielded little 
concrete progress on 
Afghanistan, disarmament or 

, any other major world issue. 
But they say Soviet authorities 
appear eager to pursue talks 
nonetheless, if only to avoid 
diplomatic isolation and retain 
some vestiges of detente. 

Soviet diplomats admit they 
were worried by the United 
States' decision early this year 
to reduce official contacts 
between Mos cow and 
Washington over the Soviet 
military intervention in 
Afghanistan and by American 
pressure on its allies an 
Western Europe to take a 
similar course,

KKK's Metzger Makes Election Exciting 
MOlt local contes .. were not al'spectacular as the 

roller·coaster race in the 43rd congressional district 
which had Ku Klux Klan Leader Tom Metzger 
.ahead of challenger Edward Skagen for .most of the 
evening. 

This i, how the congressional races will look in 
November : in the 48th congressional district, 
Democrat Michael Dow, who whipped Basil Roman, 
will face Robert Badham. 

In the 41 st district, state senator Bob Wilson, who 
defeated supervisor Jim Bates by about 4,000 votes, 
will face Bill Lowrey, who barely beat Dan 
McKinnon. 

In the 42nd district, incumbant Lional Van'Deerlin 
still doesn' t know who his opponant will be. At 1:00 
this morning, Duncan Hunter and Mike McQuellin 
were 19 votes apart with 71 percent of the votes 
counted. 

In the race for the state senate, Democrat Dan 
Finnigan will face Republican Jim Ellis. Both won 
their 39th district primaries handily, Ellis defeating 

Libertarian city councilman Fred Schnaubelt by over 
17,000 votes. 

Republican assembly races ran true to form. 
UCSD Republican assemblyman Bob Frazee and 
incumbants Larry Kapiloff, Pete Chacon and 
Waddie Deddeh all won renomination. AU will face 
opponants who are not expected to do well. 

In the 74th district, Republican Marion Bergeson 
will face Democrat Jack Baldwin. Both ran 
unopposed. In the 75th district, Republican David 
Kdly will face Daryll Gill. Both also ran .unopposed. 

In the 77th district, Floyd Morrow and Fred Nagd 
were separated by only 80 votes and the race was too 
close to call. The winner of that contest will run off 
against Larry Stirling. 

Lucille Moore and Roger Hedgecock both won 
reelection to the County Board of Supervisors. 
Hedgecock steamrolled two candidates and took 
two-thirds of his district, which includes UCSD. 
Moore, running against a field of five other 
candidates 38 percent of the votes. 

AS Conside~s Cutting ASIO Budget

salaries for those who work on the program. 
"In principle, I agree with that philosophy," said 

Lofgren. "Yet the amount of work those involved 
with the program have to do is above and beyond the 
call of duty of a volunteer, and if the program's 
directors can't depend of salaries, the quality of the 
program will suffer," he believes. 

Charlton says the AS "wi ll probably fund 
CASINO (the Internship Office) for next year, as it is 
a viable student service. Yet we will encourage the 
program to .explore other sources of funding and 
perhaps work more directly with other other 

Lofgren feels "the Internship Office will collapse" if 
the AS only allocates $3,000 for the program. 

"The AS claims they don't have any money. Yet if 
they prioritize their funding, they should be able to 
find enough to support this valuable student service'," 
he said. 

''' I've been called 'special interest' for asking for 
this money," Lofgren continued. "But the fact is that 
internships provide students with one type of work 
experience that is very valuable when they enter the 
job market. The AS will be making a very serious 
mistake if they deny us funding," he concluded.

Student Involvement 
Gov't Examined 

A committee of students,' 
faculty, and administrators i. 
examining the role of 
studenta in campus decision· 
making and is eager to get 
student and faculty opinion 
on this vital topic. The 
committee was appointed in 
Marcil 1980 in response to a 
directive from President 
Saxon that each campus 
prepare a plan for student 
participation In campus 
governance. 

A Presidential Statement 
of University Policy on 
Student Participation In 
Governance issued by 
President Saxon last year 
serves as the basis for the 
committee's work . The 
Presidential Statement says 
that "efforts should continue 
to be lirecled toward 
improving not only the extent 
but also the quality and 
effectiveness of student. 
involvement." Governance is 
defined as more than the 
procell of making decisions. 
It also includes providing 
opportunities for informal 
interactions among members 
of the university community, 
for expression of concerns, 
for consideration of 
alternative solutions, and for 
reconciliation of differing 
viewpoints. 

In accordance with 
President Saxon's charge, 
the committee is focusing on 
administrative areas and the 
academic departments_ 
Student involvement In 
Academic Senate matters is 
beyond the purview of the 
committee, but Pre.ident 
Saxon is "encouraging direct 

discusaion between students 
and the Academic Senate on 
student participation in the 
deliberations of the Senate." 

In its work so far the 
committee has identified the 
major areas of decision· 
making on campus in which 
student involvement IS 
critical. Within those areas, 
several departments or 
offices have been selected for 
study. An academic 
department subgroup 
composed of faculty member 
Alfred Manaster, students 
Brad Barham and Debbie 
Yager Lin, and administrator 
Wayne Gray is looking at 
curriculum a nd courses , 
graduate student financial 
support, teaching evaluation, 
and facuIty recruitment, 
promotion, and tenure. An 
Academic Affairs subgroup 
composed of student Brad 
Barham and administrator 
Jean Fort is reviewing the 
Computer Center, Registrar, 
EOP, OASIS, and Office of 
Relations with Schools. 
As-sistant University 
Librarian Joan Chambers 
and graduate student Debbie 
Yager Un are exarrlining 
student involvement In 
decision· making 10 four 
Student Affairs units: 
Student Health Services, 

Counselin~ and Psychologi-
cal Services" Student 
Financial Services, and 
Intercollegiate and Recrea· 
tional Athletics. A fourth 
subgroup, whose members 
are student Warren Wheeler 
and Vice Chancellor·Student 
Affairs Dick Armitage, IS 
reviewing student input into 

decisions made by the Office 
of the Chancellor and areas 
under the jurisdiction of the 
Vice Chancellor-Administra· 
tion and Vice Chancellor· 
Business and Finance. Eric 
Wahrenbrock from the 
School of Medicine is also a 
member of the full 
committee. 

The committee is looking 
at how departments and 
offices obtain student views 
on matters which affect 
students. Student opinions 
are most frequently obtained 
from students who serve on 
committees , from student 
interns 10 offices, and 
throu gh informal talks 
between students, faculty, 
and administrators. The 
committee is also attempting 
to assess how effective 
student participation is and 
how it can be iniproved. The 
selection, training, and 
continuity of student 
participants are other 
important topics being 
addressed. 

The committee welcomes 
comments from students, 
faculty , and administrators 
on any aspect _ of student 
participation In campus 
decision.making. Comments 
may be telephoned, given in 
person , or submitted In 
writing to any member of the 
committee. Telephone 
numbers and addresses of 
committee members may be 
obtained by calling the Chair 
of the Committee, Jean Fort, 
at X3683. Pick up the 
telephone now and let the 
committee know your 
thoughts on this matter.

1M Volleyball Playoffs 
to Finish Season T oda 

Title Races Have Shown Few Surprises 
BY BARBARA HAAS 

S~Eclitor 
Intramural volleyball 

playoffs wind up today 
marking the end of anothe; 
UCSD recreation. There have 
been few surprises in the title 
races, with Women's AA and 
the Men'. AAA leagues 
providing the most excite. 
ment. 

In Women'. A the 
defending champions, We Still 
Dig Bau., .houId repeat the 
crown thi. year with their 
undefeated season at 18. 

Afler not moving up despite 
demolishing all their 
competition last year, they 
may get the Czar's 
Sandbagger of the Court 
Award. 

The Czar, an omnipotent 
and anonymous SOurce of 

. information operating out of 
the Intramural office, only 
bestows this merit upon those 
who deliberately, with 
conscious forethought and 
planning, stay in a lower 
league to avoid the heat. 

Looking to challenge the 

Balls should be Sets and 
Violence, which finished with 
12-3 for the season. 

In the Women's AA league 
division, Return of ' Eva's 
Beavas are the odds-on 
favorite. With a final record of 
15-3, the best in the league, 
they should have no trouble 
damning the opponents. SliD, 
the Biohazarda might be an 
ob.tacle, de.pite their 
mediocre season of 11-7. 

The men'. leagues are 
closer conteita. In Single A, 
Nazgul at 22·2 and Rod 
Monster. at 22·4 are the 
primary contender •. The final 
decision should be close, as the 
two teams have been 
consistent throughout the 
sea.on. 

Men's AA is "our biggest 
and moat wide open" 
according to Scott Berndes ~f 
the 1M Office. "It's going to be 

volJeybaJl 

. really tight winning this one," 
he says. The three league 
champions, Zebra Hunter, 
More CMP and Rice Pots are 
expected to battle it out for the 
crown. Zebra Hunter is a slight · 
favorite at 21.0, while More 
CMP would up with 17 ·4. 
Rice Pota finished one win 
behind, with a 16·5 season 
record.

Poetry/Steve Roberts 

Berrigan Works Detenl1ined 
by Unique 'Cut-Up' Style 

Poet Ted Berrigan puzz my 
mind. He's in my head. He has 
big fingers. And with them he 
held various pages of ,poems 
which he read to an audience 
of about 60 people last 
Wednesday at the Center for 
Music Experiment (Warren 
Campus) as part of the New 
Poetry Series here at UCSD. 

What amazes me most 
about Berrigan is that he 
doesn't seem to be very 
concerned with impressing the 
academi community (nor 
anyone, for that matter), and 
that, for an "established poet," 
is a refreshing change. He is a 
big man, with many books of 

poetry to his credit, such as 
The Sonnets, Red WagorJ, In 
The Early Morning Rain, and 
Many Happy Returns. Last 
Wednesday, he read mostly 
from his recent book of 
selected poems, So Going 
Around Cities, and in his 
apparent disconcern, 
impressed many with what I 
can only describe as a 
seemingly simplistic abandon. 

Berrigan'. poetry is 
complex, containing a unique 
and .omewhat bizarre use of 
language which has changed 
over the year. from book to 
book. Hi. 6r.t book, The 
Sonnets, contains a series of 
poems which could hardly be 
classified 81 traditional 
"sonnets" in the Shakespear-
ean sense (although they are 
fourteen lines long). In them, 
he intertwines and switches 
certain lines throughout aU the 
poem., creating a sort of 
cyclical effect within the book. 
By The Early Morning Rain, 
however', his use of language 
seem. to have changed. 
Although it is still quite off-the-
wall, it i. more' direct -= in a 
way, simpler. 

Throughout many of his 
poems, there are references to 
first names such as Marge, 
Jane, Deke, Carol and Chris. 
He doesn't explain who these 
people are; some know their 
identity, some don't. Perhaps 
they function as Berrigan's 
tribute to the "personalism" of 
New York School poet Frank 
O'Hara. Or perhaps they are 
just there, in the poems, as 
Berrigan would probably say. 

Stylistically, Berrigan i •• ort 
of a cro.s between Phillip 
Whalen and John Berrymen. 
He shares with these poet. 
both a strange .ense of humor 
and a quick rich, colloquial i-
zed wit. Berrigan is, however, 
Berrigan first and foremost; 
there is no doubt of that. In 
fact, his greatest strength lies 
in his uniquity. 

Berrigan came in at the tail 

end of the New York School of 
poets, which included writers 
such as Frank O'Hara, 
Barbara Guest, Kenneth 
Koch, and John Ashbery. 
Like these other poets, he 
worked closely at times with 
some of the painters in the 
area, producing broadsides 
(posters) and other collabora. 
tions. Among the artists he 
worked with and befriended 
are painters Joe Brainard and 
Larry Rivers. 

The artists of the New York 
School concerned with 
collages and "cut-ups", as well 
as many other forms of art 
which fell roughly into the 

\ 
categories of Abstract 
Expressionism and Pop Art. 
To show how Berrigan 
portrayed the concept of "the 
cut.up" in his poetry, I will 
quote one poem from The 
Sonnets: 

XV ' 
In Joe brainard's collage its 
l,I·hite arrow 
He is not in it, the hungry dead 
doctor. 
Of Marilyn Monroe, her white 
teeth white-
I am truly horribly upset 
because Marilyn 
and ate King Kom popcorn, " 
he 'wrote in his 
01 glass in Joe Brainard's 
collage 
Doctor, but they say "I LOVE 
YOU" 
and the sonnet is not dead. 
takes the eyes away from the 
grail words, 
Diary. The black heart beside 

the fifteen pieces 
Monroe died, so 1 went to a 
matinee B-movie 
washed by Joe's throbbinR 
hands. "Today 
What is in it is sixteen ripped 
pictures 
does not point to William 
Carlos Williams. 
As you can see,. the narrative 
in the poem does indeed seem 
"cut up." If, however, you 
read the first line, then the last; 
then the second line, then the 
second line from the bottom; 
and continue in this manner 
until you reach the middle of 
the poem, you will find a 
straight and true narrative. It is 
as if he wrote a poem, and then 
cut out the lines and rearran-
ged them, just as in a collage. 
Brilliant, no? Yes. This techni-
que shows the complexity and 
craft of Berrigan at his best, 
where he has perfectly mirror-

. ed the concept of "the cut-up" 
- taking it from its original 
context (the canvas) and 
placing it into a new one (the 
poem). In doing so, he has let 
the content of his poem (Joe 
Brainard's collage) determine 
its form . Needless to say, this 
is what many contemporary 
American poets are trying to 
do today. 

To risk a cliche, I'd have to 
say that Ted Berrigan stands 
as one. of the most compeling 
figurell in the modern 
American poetry scene. By his 
own determination to create a 
poetry that is individualistic 
and apart from the current 
streams of poetric theory, he i. 
.'1 poet who justifiably stands 
out from the crowd. Which is 
not to say that Berrigan 
himself takes hi. position too 
seriously. Commenting last 
VVednesday on how he 
thought his audience 
r,erceived hi. work, he .aid 
• ... mo.t people don't 

understand my poetry ... " and 
then, adding with a wry Imile, 
"but that doesn't matter. 
Nothing matter •. " • contend 
that 8errrigan matter., a 
opinion that Deice, Marge, 
Jane, Anne, and Carol. think 
would concur with.

Van Haleri Album Stale, 
While Clapton Short-Winded 
W~men and Children fir.t - Van Halen 
(Warner Brothers) 

If you're given to the Big Bang Hypothesis, 
which in rock·critic parlance means that any 
music that sustains itself with sledgehammer 
rhythms and bombing raid volume is 
necessarily gold because it fulfills one's 
occasional need to throw aesthetic concerns 
aside in favor of some audio masochism, then 
you're going to love the new Van Halen effort, 
Women and Children First . But as much as I 
like hard rock, I don't like taking a beating 
without a reason. The songwriting on this disc is 
slack and derivative, lacking the snagging 
hooks, concise arrangelTlents, and catchy ri ffs 
that made earlier songs such as "Jamie's 
Crying," "Dead Or Alive," "Women In Love" 
and " Ain' t Talkin' 'Bout Love" examples of 
rare hard·rock intelligence. True, Eddie Van 
Halen's guitar work crackles and explodes like 
fire crackers and David Lee Roth's singing 
retains its boys.night.out affability, but these 
traits by themselves sound stale. As is, Eddie's 
licks sound standard and Roth, continuing the 
stud·lor·hire vein, reminds me 01 a dumb jock 
with sagging musde tone whose sexual 
braggadocio attempts to hide the fact that he 
rarely, if ever , gets any. Personally, I'd like to 
think better of these guys. C. 

Ju.t One Night - Eric Clapton (RSO) 

While it's nice to hear Clapton play guitar 
again with some 01 the spark he showed with 
John Mayall and Cream, you stiD wonder what 

use there is in owning yet another live album by 
the guy. Over the last six years or so, his live 
tours have been dutifully presented with Derek 
and the Dominoes Live, Eric Clapton's 
Rainbow Concert, EC Was Here, along with 
the Cream sides on Wheels of Fire, Goodbye 
and Live Cream7 Volumes One and Two . With 
these records, as with the new Just One Night , 
the Eric Claplon dilemma emerges: a first.rate 
blues sly list whose playing turns short winded 
and affected when he goes long. I suspect this 
problem comes from the travails of the 
Superstar system. Clapton is a musician of 
distinct but singular a bilities whose solo efforts , 
with the exception 01 Layla, have not shown 
him 10 be an especially engaging singer (not on 
all the songs, at least), a particularly deft 
songwriter, nor a band leader of any notable 
charisma. C lapton, I would say, is a victim of 
hero worship, a team player who got cheated 
out of the chance to do his best work by ' a 
reputatiol1 neither he, nor anyone else, could 
have lived up to. 

The fact that the lion's share 01 material on 
Jwt One Night has been given live on disc 
treatment more than once before and that the 
band , desp i te Clapton's infrequent 
assertiveness , trundles through the songs 
sluggishly, makes this affair all the more 
despairing. elapton sounds reluctant to take 
command of the proceedings, and his lolos are 
often spiritlessly mechanical and faltering, 
which leaves the overall'abric of the sound full 
of tears and gaping holes. Perhaps Clapton 
sliould take an extended rest. I preler silence to 
half· hearted rehashes. D.

Books Show Humanist Vision 
Feminist Author Explores 'Zone' Relationships of People 

Shikasta 
by Doril Leslin~ 
(Alfred Knopf, $10.95) 
The Marriages Between 
Zones Three, Four, and Five 
by Doris Lessing 
(knopf, 510.(0) 

"I've recently acquired a 
thought but not too 
leriously, of course ~ which 
is: is it possible that women 
arrived on thil planet from 
quite a different planet from 
men at some'point? We have 
aueb difficulty in relating, in 
understanding each other. It' s 
jUlt possible that we're 
different species altogether." 

BY OfRIS SHERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Doris Lessing is an 
important writer. Her two 
most recent books, Shikasta 
and The Marriages Between 
Zones Three, Four, and Five 
are stylistic . departures from 
her previous works, both 
lOI11ewhat loosely cloaked in 
lCience fiction and fantasy. 
But Leasing continues to 
speak with the voice of a 

concerned humanist, provid-
ing us now with a vision of the 
direction of our frenzied lilles, 
Despite their imaginary 

. trappings, S~ikasta and The 
Marriages .are books about 
intensely real relationships 
between people. 
-Doris Lessing, from an 
interview in the NY Times 
Rook Review 

Shikasla IS i:l planet, a very 
hospitable world with ripe 
potential lor genetic 
experimentation. Canopus 
and Sirius, the two benevolent 
galactic powers, seed the 
planet with intelligent 
hominids, structuring the 
world into a system of zones, 
somewhat reminiscent of 
Dante's Hell. 

The book Shikasta is a 
report, a textbook of sorts, 
detailing the efforts of lahor, 
one of the "experimenters" 
from Canopus. We follow 
lohor through the various 
zones as he watches the 
gradual decline and eventual 
self-destruction of the 
inhabitants of. Shikasta, 
powerless as an individual to 

do anything but try to 
encour age some of the more 
intelligent, sensitive natives. 

Later we learn that Shikasta 
is actually Earth, that all of the 
events and myths revealed to 
us as ' legendary history may 
actually have occured 
somewnere in our remote pasl. 

We realize that the scope of 
the book is monumental, 
although presented to us 
humbly in the form of a 

~rlonal narrative by lohor. 
This allowl the book to 
operate on a multitude of 
levels, functioning simultan· 
eously as a history text for 
Canopean students, as a diary 
which clearly delineates the 
sensitive, caring soul of the 
emmisary lohor and as a 
prophetic work which narrates 
events right up to the end of 
Shikastan history. It ihould be 
carefully considered by its 
current inhabitants - namely 
us. 

The Marriages Between 
Zones Three, Four and Five is 
the second published work in 
the series (The Sirian 
Experiments will be the third of

a projected six), Its scope is 
vastly different, presenting us 
with a more detailed 
deicription of the interactions 
between the "zones". Lessing 
has chosen to create archtypes 
as residents of each zone, and 
her voice is that of the 
Chroniclers of zone three, a 
peaceful, socialistic zone 
which is instructed to "marry" 
the warlike, structured and 

Cailt~-~~~' ~!..lzone four. 

Doris Lessing 
From the beginning we are 

presented with conflicting 
dichotomies in relationships: 
zone against zone, men vs, 
women, all told in the flat yet 
strikingly concise monotone of 
an observer from zone three. 
The subtlety and intricacy of 
this presentation penetrates 
deeply - we think long and 
hard about relationships, and 
how they shape our world and 

our needs as individuals. 
Lessing, in a New York 

Times Book Review 
interview, has talked about her 
concerns as a feminist. "I've 
lost my moral indignation 
completely," she says, 
speaking about The Marria-
ges "I certainly try to 
understand what is happening. 
That's quite different from 
trying to think what ought to . 
be happening." 

As an outspoken feminist, 
Lessing has gained quite a 
literary reputation from works 
such as The Children of 
Violence books and The 
Golden Notebooks. 

What makes The Marria-
ges such an important book is 
that the feminist concerns 
'which are expressed are 
handled in a skillful , delicate 
fashion, showing repression 
and role/ expectation to be 

. faults of individuals. 
These individuals were 

shaped by their societies, 
certainly. But what we see is 
the beautiful, warm and loving 
AI'Ith from zone three married 
to the boorish childlike Ben 
Ata of zone four . As Ie~ders of 
-their zones and as lover, they 
both succeed in drastically 
changing one another, 
intermingling both their good 
and bad qualities . Contradic-
tion within a person and within

place mostly in the mind and i.

Michael, as the god.like 
dungeon master, has chosen 
to design not a dungeon but a 
world, which has a continent 
and islands. He keeps its map 
hidden behind a propped.up 
book. The player. get to see 
only tha,t portion of the world 
which is immediately around 
them. It is drawn on a separate 
piece of graph paper. As they 

move on, they see more. They 
have to fipe out where they 
are and how to travel. 

Michael sum. up the action 
thus far, for the benefit of Carl 
Y OIt, who is picking up a 
character, a giant, that 
another player ran last week.

Another mystery has been

amount too small to meet the 
needs of the .tudents. 

1he solution to our .ituation 
is simple. Since the funding in 
que.tion come. from the 
Activity Fee we pay each 
quarter, we must raise this fee 
which has been $6.00 per 
quarter .ince 1967. An 
increase of $4.00 is needed to 
put UCSD on par with the 
other UC campu.es and 
inflation. 

Right now the ACUCSD 
council could agree to endorse 
this fee raise and it would likely 
pau at the upcoming Regents 
meeting, to be then put into 
effect for Winter Quarter 
1981. Seeing the urgency of 
this matter and the inevitable 
need for the fee increase, the 
council has begun a desperate 

attempt to get thousand. of 
.ignatures of endorsements in 
a week. period ending today at 
4:30. If this i. not 
accompH.hed adequately and 
now, we will have to wait an 
additional two or three 
quarter. and the consequences 
of .uch a delay would be 
drastic. 

I urge you to .ign thi. 
petition which will be 
circulating the campus, in 

Revelle Time Out, Muir's 
Clouds Rest. Again, if more 
than two or three thousand 
signatures are not received by 
today then the AS council, in 
order to represent the student 
body will most likely fail the· 
Activity Fee increase and we 
will soon notice many changes 
in our already "boring" school. 
Please help the AS help y~u.

Proposition 1, which would 

have provided a bond measure 
to create more park space, 
lost, and Proposition 4, which 
would have made it easier to 
establish low.rent housing, 
also lost. AU other state 
propositions won. 

City Proposition A, which 
would require the city council 
to make police spending its 
number one priority, was a 
landslide victor, capturing 60 
percent of the vote. 
Proposition B, a binding 
arbitration intitative that also 
applied to ' police, . lost ' by 
14,000 votes. 

A proposal to wVlde City 
council election by districts 
trailed by 600 votes, with 80 
percent of the votes tallied. 
Proposition D, which would 
amend the gty charter by 
eliminating the current five 
percent interest limit on tax 
anticipation notes, won with 
68 percent of the vote.

Proposition E, ,which would · 
tighten the conditions for firing 
civil service employees, won 
by 57 percent. 

There were no surpises in 
primary races other than' the 
close Skagen·Metzger 
contest. No incumbent lost, 
and State Senator Bob Wilson 
defeated Jim Bates as 
expected for the Democratic 
nomination in the 41st 
cong)'essional district. 

UCSD's Assemblyman 
Bob Frazee won and city 
luminaries Lionel Van Deerlin, 
Larry Kapiloff, Pete Chacon, 
Wadie Deddeh and Clair 
Burgener all won their races 
handily. The race between 
Floyd Morrow and Fred Nagel 
was too close to determine a 
wmner. 

Burgener, the incumbent, 
will face Skagen in November. 
Frazee will face Mike Becker, 
who won the Democratic 
Assembly nomination 
unopposed.
