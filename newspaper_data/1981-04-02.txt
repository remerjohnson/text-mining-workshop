Rape epidemic: angry 
group tneets ",ith police 
Demand that police 
release rape figures 

BY LI A ULLIVAN 
AND WILLIAM HAMILTON 

t.m Writer!. 

Pu blicit y generated by Monday ' 
Guardiau arti les on the campu rape 
epidemic have brought two quick re pon e . 

Fir t , the problem is evid ntly wor 'e than 
reported . 

Two more w men hav com forth with 
the informal ion that they were raped, and 
'everal other unconfirmed reports of 
attempted rapes have been transmitted to 
the paper, adding to the 12 known ince 
January . 

And an "emergency" m ting of about 35 
men and women and police repre entati 
Sgt. Clark Martin wa condu ted by 
con er member of th philo ophy 
department Tue day. 

i'W need to kno'w, for example, where 
these thing happen, and under what 'ort 
of circum tance . From the storie we've 
been told, things are happening in broad 
daylight , in the parking lot and in area 

w~er th r havebeenotherp plearound," 
saId Barbara Winter of the philo ophy 
department. 

:'We .need to know something about those 
things In order to be prudent at lea t inour 
behavior, " aid Winters.' , 

"We as the police department do not 
report any crime. We report nothing. 
Unless the newspaper hear about it from 
another source, and then comes to u we will 
not do that," Martin said . 

If a rape victim asks the campus police not 
to publicize the report, the police 
department will not disclo e detail of the 
incident, he added. "The victim' rights 
certainly have to be protected . 

"We have a form that we will have a 
victim fill out if she chooses not to make a 
police report." he said. 

A rape victim who would like to alert the 
campus police about the attack on her 
without filing a complete police report can 
obtain the form at the Health Center. It asks 
for no name or date, but only the 
information which the victim would like to 
divulge. 

Martin also cited police statistics on rape 
which he claims are contrary to tho e 
reported in the Guardian. 

"In 1980·81 0 far this school year we've 
had three attempted rapes and one rape. In 
1979-80 we had three attempted rapes. '78· 
79 we had no incidences reported . And back 
in '77-78 we had two rapes reported on 
campus. 

"Those are the statistics as reported to u , 
the only one we have concerning rape. As 
you can see, that's quite contrary to what 
the Guardian reported thi week II aid 
Martin. ' 

The article stated that "the Campus 
Police Department disclosed last Friday that 
one actual rape and two attempted rapes 
have been officially reported at UCSD." 

Guardian reporters learned from other 
campu official that there have been at 
lea t 12 rapes, or attempted rape,

Duarte case: 
police must

BY WILLIAM HAMILTON

Stal( Writer .. 
Amid t erie ' of negligence and 

concealment of the rapeepidemic,the 
most severe critici m is of officials 
who refuse to tell what they know 
about the problem. 

A morbid precedent forcing 
revelation of rape information ba 
arisen from an incident at San Ditgo

student at SDSU, was ra .

The decedent's mother, Yvonne 
Duarte, filed suit in Superior Court 
on Oct. 14, 1975. naming the State of 
California, CSUSD and Does I-X as 
defendants. 

The complaint alleged that prior to 
the rape and murder of Tanya, the 
university was aware that t 
existed a chronic pattern of assault4. 
rapes and other attacks on wom in 
the university community, and 
not only was the situ at ion alarmi

BY JEFF BERESFORD,HOWE

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affair Richard Armitage has 
given hi assurance to 
Daycare Center supporter 
that registration fees will 
fund the center's two CETA 
po it ions facing the Reagan 
budget guillotine. 

And Reg Fee reversed it 
deci ion not to fund the two 
positions at its la t meeting 
in March . 

Without the two positions, 
the center could lose tate 
funding contingent on it 
child·adult ratio. The state 
provide most of the center's 
budget. 

The Reg Fee committee 
voted in early March not to 
fund the two po itions, but 
Armitage said yesterday that 
he was "amazed" at that 
early decision , and decided 
immediately to over· ride 
thier recommendation (they 
are hi advi ory committee). 

"Why the hell hold a 
referendum if you don't pay 
any attention to them?" h 
aid. 
A referendum on campu 

three years aRO found 
overwhelming tudent 
upport for both current and 

increased level of funding by 
Reg Fee for the center. 

Armitage' decision has 

been endorsed by the Reg Fee 
committee. which rever ed 
it elf Thur day of the 10th 
week la t quarter. 

"A lot of factor cau ed u 
to change our mind ," 
committee chairwoman 
Cathy Valerio aid. 

For one thing, everyone on 
the committee was there the 
second time." 

"For another thing, the 
co mmittee knew that 
Armitage was going to fund 
it, and that played a role in 
making up a lot of mind . 

"There wa also a lot of 
pres ure from people at that 
meeting to fund Daycare. I 
think they were raly rude, 
becau e we weren't even 
going to consider Daycare 
that day, but we cou Id have 
con idered it again later. 

"Anyway, they kn w they 
had the money," Valerio 
added .

-Conunentary 

Union leaders rein in rank-and-file activism 
BY PATRICK MARSHALL 

SAN mEGO - When 
executive officials of the AFL-
CIO gathered in a Florida 
resort hotel last February, 
much of their talk focused on 
the hard times expected 
under a stridently pro· 
bus iness Reagan Admini · 
strat ion. Their answer to 
these troubles, as announced 
by AFL·CIO president Lane 
Kirkland, was that labor 
should be more active in 
national party politics. 

If the convention had been 
held in San Diego instead of 
Florida, and if the executives 
had ventured down to San 
Diego's bustling shipyards, 
they might have found an 
even greater threat to their 
leadership than that posed by 
an anti -union administra-
tion. 

Workers at San Diego's 
giant National Steel and 
Shipbuilding Company 
(NASSCO) have, for the past 
year and a half, been 

embroiled in a i'truggle with 
management over wages, 
safety conditions and other 
issues. 

And the young and largely 
third world workers at 
NASSCO - along with a 
growing number of workers 
in other unions around the 
country - consider their 
own national leadership to be 
as much an enemy as the 
company management. 

"The International i 
supposed to be like a lawyer 
for u," ays Ironworker 
Manual E cavara, in halting 
English . "but when you need 
them they kick you in the 
butt . They're just there to 
take our dues.' 

"Kirkland and the other 
leader at the national level 
have lost touch with the 
workers," explains Miguel 
Salas, the 28-year·old leader 
of an activist group of 
Ironworker. "As soon as the 
economy gets tight, they 
start telling us how we've

Apartment sign-ups 
a mess for students 

Editor: 
Another university 

administrational department 
ha finally outdone the 
Financial Aid Office in its 
ineptness and ability to 
create chao . I am referring to 
the dispensing of 'Re erva· 
tion Contracts' for the 
summer apartments at Third 
College several weeks ago. I 
have included the quotation 
mark because what was 
actually distributed could 
never be termed a contract. 
Let me describe to you what 
the original Housing Office 
instruction were a to the 
di tribution of contracts: 

-Go to the Hou s ing 
Ca hier on Wedne day, 
March 11, and starting at 9 
am, reservation contracts 
will be given out; 

-The contracts will be 
given out on a fir ·t come, first 
serve basis, tarting at 9 am; 

- The apartments must be 
secured by a deposit of $45, 
payable on that day. when 
the contract is given out; 

- The first 172 men and 
152 women who ecure the 
contracts are guaranteed a 
space as long as they 
continue to qualify for the 
program. return the contract 
on time. and pay the final 
$300 by June 5. 

Now. let me de cribe what 
actually occured. Because of 
the popularity of the 
apartment and the reason· 
able rates charged for 
summer rent. students began 
lining up outside the Housing 
Office two days prior to the 
day the contracts were given 
out. 

The housing admini tra-
tor. because of the visibility 
of a line of ·tudents outsideof 
their office, handed out index 
cards the aft rnoon prior to 
the day s tated in the 
instructions outlined. To 
compound this grave 
violation of s tated policy. the 
students were told that, in 
addition to writing down 
their own name . addre 's and 
phone number. if they knew 
anyone els interested in the 

apartments. they could put 
their name down, too. And 
not to exclude all f1agran t 
error ' committed by the 
Hou 'ing Office, the students 
did not have to commit 
them 'elve t a $45 deposit at 
that time, but cou ld pay the 
deposit by Friday. March 13. 

Putting it lightly, the 
Hous ing Offic really blew it 
this time. Let me s ummari ze 
the chron ology of their 
mistake .: 

-Chose the dates for 
giving out the con tracts one 
week prior to final s. hardly a 
time in which students can 
'camp out' for hous ing; 

-Gave out the 'contracts' 
one da y prior to the 
advertised da y; 

-Let one per. on sign up 
for others who ma y be 
interested in s pirit, but were 
not there in body; 

-Did not require those 
s igning cards to commit 
themselve financially with a 
$45 deposi t at that time. 

Clearly. another procedure 
mus t be used to handle the 
problem of contract distribu· 
tion. Th procedure must 
give all students an equal 
opportunity to acquire an 
apartment. A lottery system. 
or room draw. is one possible 
solution . 

As for compen sat ion for 
those students who were 
denied an equal opportunity 
to acquire an apartment, I 
ask for the following : that the 
Third College Townhouse 
Apartments. Muir Apart · 
ment s or Warren Apart -
ments be opened up to those 
aforementioned students, on 
a lottery basis. 

[ would also like to urge 
other students. who also feel 
they have been denied a fair 
opportunity to acquir a 
summer apartment. tu abo 
seek compensation for the 
loss they hav e suffered 
becau' of the incompetence 
of the Housing Office. 

Lisa Roche 

just got to cooperate with 
management. In the end, it's 
the rank and file that suffers. 
And th rank and file is 
developing anti·union 
tendencies, because they're 
seei ng that their union 
aren 't doing anything for 
them." 

While dimini shing success 
in contract negotiations, 
coupled with seemingly 
endless charges of corruption 
leveled at major uni on 
officials, ha bred increasing 
apathy among worker 
acro the nation, the greater 
challenge to national union 
leaders hip is coming from the 
you ng activist like alas 
who believe strongly in the 

labor movement but feel that 
its leaders have betrayed the 
principles of unionism. 

"We're seeing a widening 
plit between the young and 

old union leaders," ays Amy 
Gladstein, a New York labor 
lawyer. "And increasingly, 
the conflicts are ending up 
in the courts." 

West Coa t labor lawyer 
Dan Siegel has also seen a 
surge of conflicts between 
locals and their national 
organizations, which have 
substantially altered the very 
structure of some union . 

"Ten year ago there 
wa n't enough trusteeship 
activity to keep a lawyer busy 
full time," ays Siegel. "Now 

I'm having trouble keeping 
up with all the cases." 

When a local is placed 
under trusteeship, all of its 
affairs are handled by the 
national organization of the 
union , and the locally·elected 
officers are replaced by 
admini trator of th e 
International. Under federal 
law, trusteeships can only be 
impo ed where there ha 
been corruption or financial 
malpract ice. where collective 
bargaining agreement · have 
been violated, or where the 
democratic procedures of th 
union have been abu ed. 

"In practice," says Siegel, 
"trusteeship is often imposed

AS Constitution outmoded, does 
not represent students fairly 
Editor: 

My involvement with the 
AS over the pas t 15 months 
has brought me to one 
overriding conclu ion: 
Fundamental changes in the 
institutions and processes of 
student government are 
essential. 

The present structure is 
simply incapable of genera-
ting and ustainin~ serious 
analysis and commItment, a 
sense of purpose and 
poss ibility, to the objective of 
furthering student participa· 
tion in thegovernanceofthi 
univers ity. For this reason, I 
am presenting to the student 
body a propo al for a whole 
new Constitution for the 
As ociated Student . 

I would like to outline my 
rea ons for coming to the 
conclusions [ have about the 
current AS structure. and 
explain how my proposed 
Cons titution would addre 
those problems. 

1) The lack of representation 
ill the present Associated 
Studellts. 

Currently. AS officers are 
'-'elected in ways t hat 
student do not recognize a 
reflecting their central 
reason for bei ng here . 
Unque tionably. the vast 
majority of s tudents place 
primary emphas i on their 
relationship to the academic 
discipline they have chosen 
to pursue. While this may at 
fi rst seem cI f-eviden t, it 
hould be recognized that 

UCSD s tudent s have 
consistently displayed a level 
of commitment and achieve-
ment that is indicative of a 

much d eper concern for the 
academic side of life than can 
be simply presumed. 

Fundamentally. what is 
needed is a student 
government that in its very 
structure reflect s the 
students concerns and 
commitments-a govern · 
ment thal reflects their 
priorities. For this rea on, I 
am proposing t he selection of 
AS Council representatives 
by academic major. Every 
academic department or 
program regularly offered as 
a major area of study would 
be guaranteed one represen-
tative. A maximum of six 
could be selected depending 
on the number of student in 
that major. This will both 
expand the size of the AS 
Council and greatly enhance 
its degree of representation . 

2) College represelltatiotl 
needs to be bolstered. 

The present structure does 
not provide for s ignificant 
part i ci pat ion of college 
representative despite their 
numbers on the Council. T 
empha ' ize that this is a 
tructural weakness and not 

a flaw in the character or 
quality of college representa-
tive. Nevertheles , recent 
AS governments have 
consistently bemaoaned the 
lack of active college 
representation of the AS 
Council. 

The new Constitution 
wOtllrl expand the number of 
college represen tat ive from 
three to four . More 
importantly. the Constitu· 
tion provides for reps from 
each college to be on all four 

tanding committees and 
insures that a college rep will 
chair those committee. 
Thu " college reps will be 
placed into pos itions of 
leadership and authority, 
facilitating their active and 
informed participation. 

3) The lack of coordinatiotl 
between the sel erat nrp.flS of 
sludettl parlicipai£oll it1 
govert/atlce. 

Student control, participa-
tion and authority is 
diss ipated by a structrual 
failure which does not 
provide for effective 
coordination between the 
various areas of student 
governance. I am thinking 
specifically of the Student 
Center and Registration Fees 
a well as various commit-
tee dealing with the 
administration of ervices 
(e.g. Hou ing and Food 
Services Committees). 
The new Constitution would 
create a standing committee 
of the AS Council to deal 
specifically with student 
participation in governance. 
One of the committee 
member would serve on the 
Student Board. another on 
the Regi s tration Fee 
Committee. This would 
provide the neces ary 
institutional structure for 
coordinating the student 
government with the two 
major area of student 
control over the administra· 
tion of services and facilities .

when the International feel 
that a local is getting too 
active on its own and i 
slipping out of control." 

Department of Labor 
tati tic confirm Siegel' 

impression that Interna -
tiona l are increa ingl y 
resorting to tru teeship by 
their national organizations. 
Just after the recess ion in 
1973. the number climbed 
over 200. And by 1980, more 
than 230 local were being 
placed under trusteeship 
each year - an increa e of 62 
percent in only 10 years. 

"The impo s ition of 
trusteeship is a dra tic step," 
s ays Siegel, "and when the 
International doe it imply 
to maintain control it can 
generate a lot of hard 
feelings. " 

Hard feelings were in clear 
evidence when, lastJanuary , 
NASSCO' two large t 
unions - the Ironworkers 
and the Machinists - were 
placed under trusteeship. 

. Salas, who had been fired 
from his pos ition as Ass't 
Business Agent of Ironwor-
kers Local 627, ran for the top 
position of the local in 
election last Decem ber. 
Salas won the election only to 
see the International impose 
trus teeship and seize control 
the day before he was to take 
office. 

According to Victor Van 
Bourg, attorney for the 
International , trusteeshi p 
was imposed for several 

reason . 
"One major reason, says 

Van Bourg, "is that the local 
conducted trikes without 
approval of the In ternational, 
which they mu t ha ve. 
Another rea on is that we 
had serious quest ions about 
the election in December. 
Two thou and out of 3,200 
Ironworkers in the loca l 
didn't vote." 

According to Van Bourg, 
the most pres ing reason for 
tru teeship wa that the 
election did not hing to cure 
problems of factionalism in 
the Ironworkers local. "So 
many different groups were 
running for leadership that 
Sala was elected on only 300 
of the 1,200 votes ca t," aid 
Van Bourg. 

Salas believes that the real 
reason for the trustee hip 
was that the international 
has had a cooperative 
relationship for year with 
NASSCO and waited to make 
certain there would be no 
trike in September when 

contracts come up for 
renegotiation. 

"This is the only shipyard 
in the nation with an 
Ironworker local," says 
Sala . "Even the other 
unions tell us that the way 
the Ironworkers got into the 
yards at NASSCO was 
through sweet heart deals 
designed to keep the metal 
trade out." 

Whatever the Interna-
tional's motives for placing 
the union under trusteeship, 

the action only served to 
unite the workers in the

"Johnny," says thewoman waitin~ in line at 
the upermarket, "You know that not for 
here; it' s for the car and for when we get 
home." 

The three·year·old s heepi hly pull hi 
hands out of his pants. 

While this may sound like an unusual 
parental re pon e to a child ' masturbation , 
Dr .. Mary Calderone, noted p ychologi t / sexo-
109! t recommend that parents allow their 
children to masturbate - but he add not in 
inappropriate places. ' 

Calderone addres ed thi and many other 
topics in the area of chi ldhood sexuality 
during her lecture Tuesday night , "What 
Made You The exual Per on You Are 
Today?" that was designed to help college 
tudents understand the roots of their own 
exuality. 

While Calderone spoke on a "topic that is 
(tr aditionally) untalkable." s he handled it 
w ith flair, managing not to di comfort the 
large crowd composed mostly of middle·aged 
couple as embled in the Revelle cafeteria. 

"What we are given at birth is for u e Ihen , 
in an appropriate way," Calderone said 
summi ng up her basic a umption that 
human are born as exually active beings. 
Furthermore. she stated , "I can't believe the 
'right ' way to handle (thi inherent sexuality) 
is to 'knock it out' of the baby' ystem." 

Calderone advocated a more extensive 
program of ex education than i pre enlly 
taught in the public school sys tem, since 
children now reach sexual maturity earlier 
than in the pa t. In fact, he said, a child i 
now often capable of reproduction at nine or 
ten . 

Calderone c riti cized the lack of 
communication between parents and their 
children. "We as parents, " she aid, "don't 
realize that we are raising a on or a daughter 

to be a sexually responsible s pou e." 
She later noted with humor that parent 

themselve often cannot communicate 
between themselve, and that "if exual 
partners can begin to talk (between 

the~ elves) in ter'!1s of v~rbal intimacy it is 
easier to commUnicate With the child later ' 
on." 

Several time during the lecture, Calderone 
criticized the Moral Majority. She often called 
member ':liars" who "destructively oppo e" 
ex education. 

Apparently, the Moral Majority ran a full -
page ad ve rti sement in an Arkan a 
new paper claimi ng that SIEC (Sex 
Information and Education Council of the 
United State ), Calderone's organization, was 
"teaching children to ma turbate in the 
cia sroom , teaching them to mold penise out 
of plasticene and to make homosexuals out of 
them." 

Calderone later quipped, in indirect 
re~erence to the Moral Majority, t hat deprived 
children often grow up to be deprived adult 
who gain atisfaction out of depriving their 
own children of ex education. 

Several times, Calderone tressed that 
interference with a child ' s s exual 
development create problems in later life. To 
Calderone, sex is analogou to language: 
"Every time we punish our child for doing a 
sexual thin~, it's really as if we were ayingto 
a child that s learning to talk , 's hut up. ' And if 
we keep puni hing that child , he'll never learn 
to talk." 

Calderone brought up several other 
intere ting facts from her research on exual 
development : 

-The male experiences erections as early 
as the fetal stage in the womb; likewise, the

Rape info 
lawsuit 
at SDSU 
continued from page 1 
failed to warn and conceah::d 
the true tate of affair ' 
concer ning rape and 
as sault · upon students. A 
reasonable inference here is 
that no security devices were 
instituted. let alone minimal 
afety precaut ions such as 

waring off the degree f 
danger. The Univer it y 
allegedly ha s up erior 
knowldege and also the 
means of ini tituting some 
rea onable protective 
measures. 

"Tanya herself. it is here 
repre ented, could not 
purcha e and in tall securi ty 
devices or hire a private 
police force; he could not 
po es a dog or firearm. 

"An obligation arose to 
prov ide s u ch protect ive 
measures a were within the 
university 's reasonable 
capacity to thwart or 
diminish the po sibility of a 
forseeable rape . 

..... The university failed to 
take re pon ible precautions 
to reduce the hazard and to 
protect the residents in the 
univer ity dorms or to warn 
the tudent or to train the 
student to protect them-
selves. 

"Duarte' reliance upon 
their (the university' s) fal e 
represent at ions and the 
approximate dangers are 
appropriately alleged." 

The State's demurrer 
partially relied upon it 
suppo ed immunity a a 
sovereign entity. 

"The doctrine of sovereign 
immunity-the concept that 
the king can do no wrong-
must in this last quarter of 
the 20th century be viewed 
in light of the Supreme 
Court's expressio n in 
Muskep/: 
'When there is negligence, 

the rule is liability; 
immunity is the exception!'" 

The Court found that thf" 
complaint correctly alleged 
that the university had a 
"duty of care to provide 
reasonable security from 
foreseeable criminal acts 
against tudent tenants by 
third-party intruders," a 
duty arising due to the fact 
that they were "on notice" as 
to the likeleyhood of potential 
harm to persons who 
essentially submitted their 
ecurity to control by the 

university. 
The implications of this 

case are important for the 
UCSD community, because 
similar contractual obliga-
tions arising between 
resident students and the 
University of California as a 
result of living in camrus 
dormitorie ' exi t, as weI a 
does the potential for a 
s imilar lawsuit. 

Duarte ha . been remanded 
to the Superior Court for 
settlement judgement. The 
dispo ition of the Court may 
have far-reaching after-
effects on policies of the 
nation 's co ll eges and 
universities where security 
mat ters are concerned and 
may well red efine the 
obligations of the university 
to ensur t he safety and 
s ('urit r of its own.

unreported , ince January, 
and five in March, Martin 
a<;lmitted the po sibility of at 
lea t fiverapes in March. The 
article did not accuse the 
police of witholding 
information about officially 
reported rapes, 

The Guardian has since 
learned tliat a woman jogging 
by the Mesa Apartments on 
the morning of Oct. 8 (6:30 
am) was attacked and forced 
to orally copulate with her 
a ailant. 

According to the victim, 
who wi she to remain 
anonymou ,the incident was 
reported to campus police, 
with no reque t that it be 
kept quiet. However, when a 
neighbor phoned campu 
police ju t four hours after 
the incident to see if police 
knew about it, they denied 
ever hearing of it , 

Also, a juvenile suspect , 
implicated in area-wide ex 
crime, wa arrested and 
convicted in connection with 
a sault and rape, at lea t 
three of which occurred at 
UCSD, according to Sgt. 
Tipton of the SDPD North 
County Juvenile division, 

Tipton is especialy 
concerned about the increa e 
in sex crimes in areas 
adjacent to the campus, 

The ri k of child 
molestation is of special 
concern, given several 
uninhabited areas routinely 
used for egress by children 
walking to school. Several 
indecent exposures have 
already occurred , 

According to Tipton, the 
woman at Mesa was raped in 
territory that is part of the 
campu police beal. The 
initial report was made to the 
campus police, and then to 
SDPD, he said , 

Sgt , Larry Kenney of the 
SDSP's sex crimes division, 
ays that information about 

rapes at UCSD should be 
forwarded to his department, 
a rna t attackers are 
unaffiliated with UCSD, 

How many reports had 
been fi led with his depart-
ment since September by 
campus police? 

"None 0 far," Kenney 
said, 
Building Security 

Although there are four 
officers probing campus 
buildings each evening to 
make sure that doors are 
tightly locked, Martin said, "[ 
don' t believe there is one

secure, 

The police report a ll 
broken locks to the 

- maintenance department 
each week, "but they are not 
going to get fixed until the 
people from the department 
bJO over there and ay 'Damn 
it, we want out door lock

Martin believe ' that

staff would not be a cost-
effective solut into the rape 
pidem ic, but said that the

Brown proposes limits on regent stocks 
Bill would outlaw regents owning s tock held by UC 

BY RICK DOWER 
acramenlCl Correspondenl 

Assembl SjJt!aker Wiliie 
Brown, embroiled in a battle 
to become an appointed UC 
regent. Tuesday ubmitted a 
bill to outlaw regents from 
holding any investments that 
the University also has an 
interest in , 

Brown' s legis lation , 
announced during a capital 
press conference, tate that 
a regent shall not have an 
ownership interest in any 
corporation or bu 'ines in 
which Univer 'ity funds are 
invested, 

"That's the price you par. 
when you're in publicoffice, ' 
Brown said, 

The University of Califor-
nia currently holds a va t 
retirement and endowment 
portfolio of mo tly blue chip 
stock worth around $1.5 
billion , 

The stocks are in major 
companie such as IBM , 
Exxon , Standard Oil , 
BankAmerica , AT&T , 
General Electric , Dow 
Chemical. General Mills and 
other corporate giants. 

A number of UC regent 
al 0 ha ve s ubstantial 
holdings in some of the same 
companies. according to 
financial di closure docu-
ments on file with the Fair 
Political Practices Commis-
sion (FPPC). 

Brown' proposal coincide 
with the April 1 deadline for 
the regents to fi le their 
annual di closure tatement 
with the FPPC, 

Brown said he wasn't sure 
of the magnitude of the 
problem and conceded 
regents probably do not

Adequate light ing and the

another problem at UCSD. 
Rape Prevention Education 
Program Director Joan 
Koerper said at the m ting. 

RP EP member s took 
"lighting walks" last year 
and counted over 200 fixt ures 
out of operation. 

When Koerper reported 
this to the Physical Plant, 'he 
said. "we were told we did not 
have the expertise to kn w 
whether a light wa .

The e back reports are 
now being sea rched by 
campu architect Chuck 
Powers. who IS working on 
the problem.

Several people at the 
meeting urged that more self· 
defen 'e courses be offered on 
campu, to be ubsidized 
perhaps by the un iver . i ty . 

Currently, there i one elf· 
defen e cour e offered at 
UCSD, ubsidized in part by 
RPEP. The cour e co t $30 
and can only accomooate 15 
students. If there is enough

willing to pay, th 're might be 
a econd cou r se added, 
Koerper said. 

The Ca li fornia tate

according to staff member

Famous dance company 
combines classical, modern 

The Hartford Ballet, set [or 
unday , April 5. in

further, adding to their 
balletic tech nique a more 
innovat ive style of modern 
dance. 

Michael Uthoff. artistic 
director of the ixteen 
member company, ha 
propelled the Hartford Ballet 
into high tanding in the 
American dance world. He

diversity of hi background. 
Hi dances show a unique

Film/Rick Greene 

'Rock Show' has good tunes 
Way back in 1976, Paul 

McCartney, after years of 
hope, rumour and waiting, 
finally decided to bring his 
band Wings on a two-month 

Nort h American concert 
tour. It wa the fir t time 
Amrican audiences had seen 
the rock superstar on stage 
since the legendary final live 
Beatie concert in San 
Franci co' s Candlestick Park 
ten years earlier. Hopes were 
high for the 'Wing Over 
America ' tour and Paul didn't 
let anybody down. It was a 
coast-to·coast ellout and a 
slick, razzle·dazzle musical 
showca e for McCartney and 
Company. 

Now, five years later, the 
motion picture documentary 
of the tour, Rock Show, is at 
last flashing across screens 
nationwide as produced, 
naturally, by McCartney's 
own MPL Communications. 
Though it sometimes doesn't 
work as film, Rock Show is 
bubbling over with such 
incred i ble energy, good 
spirits and great music that it 
turns the handicap of it five-
year delay into an asset, thus 
doubling its impact. The 
movie is as fresh , lively and 
entertaining a the months 
during which it was filmed, a 
true testament to the 
timelessness of the McCart-
ney magic. 

Rock Show begins where 
the stage show begins. 
Layers of colored moke and 
waves of bubble et the 
proper fantasy atmosphere 

as Wings r ks into an 
opening medley of "Venu 
And Mars" , "Rock how" 
and "Jet. " McCartney, his 
hair un characteri ticall y 
long (pa t shoulderlength), is 
all bouncing smiles in his 
best Beatie manner. His wife 
Linda, thankfully, doe n't 
have much to do but s ing 
harmony, play the synthe· 
sizer and knock a tambourine 
and drummer Joe Engli h i 
imilarly left out of the 

limelight , but McCartney 
doesn't hog the how. 

Guitarist Denny Laine i 
spotlighted in two nice 010 
including "Go Now" bringing 
back memorie of his Moody 
Blues days. Ironically.Jimmy 
McCullough who olos on 
"Medicine Jar" about drug 

addiction, died of an overdose 
three years later. 

But audiences then and 
now are paying to see Paul 
McCartney, MBE, ex·Beatle 
and walrus, who soon scores 
with a vi ually appea ling 
version of "Maybe I'm 
Amazed." A wash of pastel 
blue and pink spotlights, 
shadows and si lhouettes, 
glitter and satin, this i 
music for the eyes. The 
midpoint highlights are the 
five Beatles ongs performed, 
including "Yesterday" and 
"Blackbird" by McCartney, 
one acoustic guitar, one soft 
spotlight and an extremely 
grateful audience. 

"We'd like to do a song now 
that goes back into the mists 

of time," says Paul before 
ripping into a rou ing ver ' ion 
of "Lady Madonna." On tag 
explos ions and strobe·like 
la r h Ip bring "Live And 
Let Die" to life and later 
during a s ond en r, a 
la er-animated blue mi st 
enhances "Soily." the only 
'new ' song performed in the 
concert. 

Only two ongs are 
performed from McCartney' 
first four solo album , the 
bulk of the material coming 
from &md 011 The Run. 
Venus Alld Mars, old Beatie 
album , and the then · 
recently-released Wings At 
Th e Speed Of Sound di c. An 
album from the tour, Wings 
Over America, wa relea ed 
that year in time for 
Christmas though not all the 
songs on the three-record 'et 
are in th movie. 

Vi s ually , Ro ck Show 
(filmed by thirteen camera 
men), ha a lot of focu 
problems and too· close 
c10seups of the noses and eyes 
of audience members. The 
editing is quite predictable, 
but then there weren't many 
options to go to. There is 
nothing new here, but a rock 
documentries go it i straight 
forward , energetic enter-
tainment from one of the 
legends in the busine . Rock 
Show is a spla hy , quick-

please tum to page 22 

These three sides of Paul 
McCartney were photo-
graphed by wife Linda. 

God, Devil watch TV, drink 
continued from page 16 
friend . "Well, whatever. The 
motherfuckin' union makes 
me wear these things . 
Standard uniform 's gotta be 
worn when I'm on call." 

"A stone drag," said Satan, 
"but fuck it. Lets pop another 
couple of brew and watch 
the flick." 
Both of them walked acros~ 

the living room to the kitchen 
and hauled two Millers from 
the refrigerator. They popped 
them, licked the foam from 
the rims of the can in tandem, 
and then walked back to the 
TV, settling into the cusions 
after pulling their chair 
closer to the creen . God 
turned up the sound, as he 
was hard of hearing. 

Ten minutes had pa, sed in 
the film since th both of 
them began crushing cans 
and a good part of th plot had 
elapsed . Torme, having 
devoured all the ·tret ch 
pants ill Las Vegas, had 
grown to an in redible 'ize 
and was now Shlldow boxin& 
again st the side of a ar ' 
Palace , using t h ' spotlights 

provided by obliging police 
who wanted to check it out. 

God sat up just then as 
though catchIng a jolt , 
cupping hi hand to his ear . 
"Hear something?" he asked . 
Puzzled, Satan clo ed his 
eyes and Ii tened , filtering 
out shouts of "r want my 
money back" from the 
pantless men. A voice, weak 
and faint like fine print 
drifted in on the breeze. 

"Always get calls during 
the best part," huffed God , 
turning to Satan , "can you 
tell who it is?" 

Satan threw his hand 
around the back of the chair 
and reclin d, careful not to 
stab himself with his arrow 
tipped tail. ''It' s yourson ,'' he 
said . 

God mad e a pain d 
expres ion . " hit. Probally 
want s money ... " 

"You gonna an 'wcr?" 
"Fu k no! I told him that if 

he's g nna tra el wit nOi11 
saving up from a decent job, 
h 'd have to rough it. " 

"You m an h shoulda paid 
the t \vo dollar fine ." 

"Damn traight." 
Both of them chortled for 

awhile and then returned 
their tare to the tube. The 
cast names were being 
superimposed over a fading 
image of the huge Torme 
placing a truck tire over the 
finger of a half-nude statue of 
a woman that used to adorn 
the roof of a strip joint before 
Torme tore it down and 
hauled it into the middle of 
the avenue. While thousand 
of people screamed in horror , 
Torme said "I do thee wed" 
and began to sing "Express 
Way to Your oul." hi ' voice 
booming for miles across the 
flat evada de ·ert. 

God 'napped off th TV. 
"Let's eat some grub," he 
said . 

" keet, " said atan. " I f el 
like Mexi an food ." 

God waved hi s hands. 
"Gives me heartburn . 
Chines i more my ·peed ." 

" Ha ve it your own way," 
said atan. tying hi s tail into 
a Boy out know. "I t's ju,· t 
grub and get ba k to work ."

CHECK IT OUT 
Tas: Natassla Kinskl, as Tess of 

the D'Urbervllles, IS a woman Vllho 
any decent man would give hiS 
soul for. With dark, expressive eyes 
and full mouth, she IS the soul of 
thiS mOlle, the reason It ult imately 
succeeds. O f course, Roman 
Polanski - ina radical departure 
from hiS usual type of movie -
does a fine job In bnnglng the 
Thomas Hardy novel of love and 
hypocrisy to the screen. The rank 
InjustICes of late 19th century 
England b lend well With the 
beautiful, enduring countryside 
But if Kmskl dldn't exiSt, Polanski 
would have had to Invent her If the 
actress playing Tess Isn't someone 
the audience can care for, no one 
would Sit through thiS three-hour 
retelling of her travails at the hands 
of lustfu l, heartless men and an 
uncaring SOCiety. By all means see 
thiS, the best movie of 1980. 

Ordln.rv Pcop'c: Robert 
Redford did a masterful job in 
putting together this film 
adaptation of the best-selling novel 
about hard times In suburbia. M.ary 
Tyler Moore, a sweetheart in TV 
land for so long, plays the bitchy 
mother In a family that starts to 
d isintegrate follOWing the 
drCMInlng death of a favorite son. 
Donald Suther land IS her 
sympathetiC husband, trying to 
hold the family together. Both are 
good, but Timothy Hutton, as the 
younger son Vllho blames himself 
for hiS brother's death, and Judd 
Hirsch, as the psychologist who 
tries to keep Hutton from cracking 
up completely, are the best. In all, 
thiS IS a satisfying, emotionally 
unflinching look at li fe.

- A fetu 's sense of

be affected by violent 
parental 'quabbling before

Calderone wa intro· 
duced by David McWhirlPr,

Calderone received ample 
applause and remained

Another 'aid, "I advocate 
talking openly about (sex 
education); I thmk it 's

An older anonymu mal 
commented that a lecture

Talk it over with us - Friday, April 17, 1981. 
That's the day a Hughes Representative will be on campus with all the facts, 
to answer questions for DP seniors and graduates. 
With your training, you can start part way up the ladder of a software career: 
programming, analyzing, designing, or implementing business systems on a 
big Burroughs B-6800. 
We're involved - and you can be involved - in reorganizing our main data 
base, debugging and updating programs, and writing new reports and pro-
cedures to advance our already advanced automated manufacture of fiber 
optic connectors, flex circuitry, and printed circuit boards. 
You know COBOL and some ALGOl. You're acquainted with Burroughs 
hardware. So you 're a candidate! 
Join us at our small but growing Hughes division in Orange County, where so 
much is happening. Then, if you want to continue your education at UC Irvine 
or elsewhere, we'll foot the bill. 
If you can't come to an April 17 interview on campus, please call Carl Weaver 
at (714) 549-5795, or write to him at: Hughes Aircraft Company, Connecting
