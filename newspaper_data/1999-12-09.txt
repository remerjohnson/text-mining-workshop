Students Voice Opposition 
PROPOSITIONS: Group discusses same-sex, juvenile bills on March ballot 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

The Student Alliance for 
Fairness and Equality, the Asian 
and Pacific Islanders 
Association, Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano/a de 
Aztlan, the African American 
Student Union and the Lesbian 
Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Association met Wednesday to 
discuss the problems with 
PropoSition 21 and 22 durfng a 
potluck dinner at the Che Cafe. 

Heather Flowe, a member of 
the Student Alliance for Fairness 
and Equality, said the meeting 
showed "a common alliance." 

According to Flowe, both of 
the propositions single out 
groups of people. Proposition 
21 will affect people of color 
and Proposition 22 will affect 
gays and lesbians. 

Proposition 21, the Gang 
Violence and Juvenile Crime 
Prevention Initiative, is spon-
sored by former Gov. Pete 
Wilson. Flowe said that if the 
proposition passes, people age 
14 and older can be tried as 
adults and could potentially 
receive the death penalty. 

The proposition also would 
expand the definition of gang 
membership and require gang 
offenders to register with 

police. The proposition would 
also allow police to wire tap 
phone lines of suspected gang 
members. 

UCSD graduate Alex Tom, a 
member of the task force for the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
and the student organization 
"Educate Don't Incarcerate," 
said that a gang is any informal 
group of three or more people. 
He said that the proposition 
would give "free reign and free 
discretion for police officers to 
do what they want." 

Under proposition 21, con-
victed people age 14 and older

Employee 
Refuses 
UC Oath 
TEACHING: Sociology 
TA refuses to sign state 
employee required form 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Staff Writer 

Kim Hansen, a graduate stu-
de!)t in SOcio logy, said he will 
accept the university's threat to 
withhold his pay in response to 
hi s refusal to sign the Ca lifornia 
Oath of Allegiance in its 
unabridged fvrm . 

According to alifornia state 
law, all employees of the state 
must sign the oath in its proper 
form before beginning work. 

Hansen, who said he does not 
consider himself to be ex tremely 
religious, refuses to sign the oath 
because of "i ts religiou word-
ing." 

The oath states: 
" I do solemnly swear (or 

affi rm) that I will support and 
defend the Constitution of the 
United States and the constitution 
of the state of California against 
all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic; that I will bear true faith and 
allegiance to the Constitution of 
the United States and the consti-
tution of the state of California; 
that I take this obligation freely 
without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion; and that I 
will well and faithfully discharge 
the duties upon which I am about 
to enter." 

He said that taking such oaths is 
unconstitutional and is specifically 
prohibited in the Bible. 

"If anyone were to ask me if [ 
support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States 
or the state of California, I can 
honestly say 'yes,'" he said. "In 
fact, as a Christian, I am obligated 
to obey the laws of the land.

UCSD Student to Appear on 'College Jeopardy' 
GAME SHOW: Roosevelt senior will compete for Volvo, $25,000 on collegiate version of trivia show 
By JANE KIM 
Staff Writer 

Becoming one of only 15 col-
lege students nationwide to com-
pete in the annual "College 
Jeopardy" trivia challenge, 
Roosevelt senior Darren Bates' 
will appear on the popular tele-
vision show in February. 

Bates will go to Los Angeles 
in January for the show's taping, 
competing for a Volvo and 
$25,000. 

In order to qualify, Bates was 
interviewed and a]so partici-
pated in mock games after 
being chosen from thousands 

of stude'lts who took a 50-ques-
tion test. Bates, who has tried 
out for the show two times 
before, said that its important 
to be presentable and vocal, 
have a good personality and 
portray a good image of 
American students when trying 
out for the show. 

"You don't have to act like a 
clown to be chosen," Bates said. 
"People who know me know 
that l'm probably not like the 
people on the show. I'm not a 
bookworm, triple major or a 
straight-A student. I just know a 
lot oT useless knowledge." 

Bates, a history major with 

an emphasis in science and 
technology, likes music and 
began playing the piano at the 
age of five. He has competed in 
the Los Angeles Marathon 
three times, participates i 1 var-
ious sports including hiking, 
likes graphic arts and has 
worked as a photographer for 
the past four years. History 
Professor Mark Hineline 
believes that Bates is highly 
qualified. 

"The fact that (Bates is) on 
Jeopardy doesn't mean he only 
knows facts. He's like a sponge. 
He soaks in information," 
Hineline said. ~'He's very broad-

minded, open and interested in 
the world ." 

People who know Bates said 
they were not surprised that he 
was chosen for the show. 

"I knew he would do it," 
Roosevelt senior Liz Lusby said. 
" It was just a matter of when. We 
just know that he's gonna win, 
and if he doesn't he'll do great 
anyway." 

Bates' friends have been con-
tributing to his preparation for 
the competition.

cards to him every night for

Regis also said that presently,

Bates is looking forward to 
the competition, and hopes to 
win the prizes. 

"If we win, the first thing 
we' ll do is go to Vegas and gam-
ble away some of the money we 
won," Bates said . "I say 'we' 
because [being on College 
jeopardy) is like representing all 
my friends." ''I'm Iclzy, I wasn't going to

said. "This didn't become a bjg 
issue to me or anyone else until 
last Tuesday when all of a sudden 
in the ninth week of my seventh 
quarter [of) teaching [the payroll 
division) decided my oath wasn't 
good enough." 

In contrast to Hansen's claims, 
Pearl Trinidad, manager of 
UCSD's payroll division, said his 
previous oaths were acceptable. 

"What I'm hoping will happen 
is that they' ll accept my state-
ment, which has the same content 
without the religious wording," 
Hansen said. "Not only will it 
solve my problem, but it will also 
give other religious students an 
alternative. It would set a useful 
precedent. I'm hoping that UC 
administrators will side with me. 
They can either side with me 
against the oath, or with the oath 
against me." 

Hansen has been hired to 
teach for winter and spring 
quarters. However, if his alter-
nate oath is rejected and he is 
fired, he will consider suing the 
university.

Professors' Boycott of 
C.A.P.E. is Unfair to Students 

Willie C. Brown, a biology professor at UCSD, 
said he refuses to be evaluated by Course and 
Professor Evaluations and cited the publication's vul-
garity as a reason for his refusal. 

Professor Brown believes that by focusing on the 
negative and outrageous comments in its "Off the 
Wall" section , C.A.P.E. contradicts its purpose, 
which Brown claims is to serve students, professors 
and the admini stration. 

C.A. P.E., which .is student-run, receives nearly 
$90,000 annually from a government grant. 

"We're funded by the government, not the A.S. 
ICouncil] or the faculty," said C.A.P.E. Director 
Jeremy Gray in an interview with the Guardian. 

Along with Brown are David Kuchta and 
Eli zabeth Jordan of Revelle Humanities, who are 
defending their right "to not be sponsors of material 
ItheYI find objectionable." 

In a letter to C.A.P.E., Kuchta and Jordan wrote, 
"The publication of the e illustrations and comments 
... call into question C.A.P.E.'s ability to objectively 
summarize student eva luations, to report on the edu-
cational value of courses and professors, and in our 
opinion, to contribute to an educational environment 
that is free of religious, sexual and racial bias." 

The Guardian feels that it is counterproductive for 
Brown, Kuchta and Jordan to boycott c.A.P.E. 
Preventing C.A.P.E. from evaluating courses and 
professors at UCSD merely hurts students. It is self-
ish for them to want to impose their editorial com-
ments on a third party evaluator. If they don't 
approve of the evaluations, Brown, Kuchta and 
Jordan don't have to, and shouldn't, use them, but 
keeping such a service from students is wrong, 

Students deserve and need a student-run forum in 
which to voice their opinions of classes and profes-
sors. C.A.P.E. is the only opportunity for students to 
do this and learn what their peers think of a particu-
lar class or professor. 

If Brown, Kuchta and Jordan truly wanted to help 
C.A.P.E., they would work with the publication, not 
against it. They cannot expect to receive constructive 
-criticism from C.A.P.E. evaluations, when their own 
critici m of C.A.P.E. is far from constructive. 

"One of the things the grant money is mandated 
for is student evaluation of the curriculum, and I 
think that C.A.P.E. is the best use of that money," 
Revelle Provost Thomas Bond said . 

These professors should stop taking offense at 
material that doesn't appear to be dissuading students 
from reading C.A.P.E. and instead focus on support-
ing the positi ve aspects of the publication.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD 
SPARKS INTERNATIONAL DEBATE 

COllMENTARY: Europeans are more wary of new food strains than Americans 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Staff Writer 

In the endless bickering and com-
mercial wars between the United 
States and Europe, the spotlight is cur-
rently on genetically modified food. 
To put it succinctly: Europeans don't 
want it, while Americans have been 
eating it for several years. 

The debate over engineered food 
has been quite heated in Europe, 
while in the United States it has lain 
relatively dormant. However, the 
recent demonstrations at the World 
Trade Organization meeting in 
Seattle, as well as other signs of awak-
ening debate, show that the topic is 
becoming increasingly important here 
as well. 

As in many debates, the arguments 
are never fully objective, and clear cul-
tural biases are at work. After years of 
mad cows, Belgian dioxin chickens 
and poisonous French Coke, 
Europeans are more than a little sus-
picious of any food regulation, as well 
as being concerned with maintaining 
the traditional flavors of national cui-
sine. Americans are traditionally more 
enthusiastic about technology, more 
used to relatively flavorless industrial 
food and seem more willing to 
embrace this kind of innovation. 

The debate so far has raised two 
essential points: 1$ genetiC modifica-
tion a safe, useful technology that will 
have positive long-term effects on the 
global availability of food? Even if 
genetic modification is safe and use-
ful, should consumers be warned on 
the label that the food they ~re about 
to eat is genetically modified? 

The American food industry gives 
an emphatic "yes" to the first ques-
tion, and an equally emphatic "no" to 
the second. European and third world 
fl<,tions disagree vehemently. 

The two questions are, to a large 
extent, independent: The former con-
cerns the safe insertion of a new tech-
nology in a delicate ecological balance 
already upset by intensive agriculture, 
while the 'a tter is a more elementary 
question of consumer awareness. 

Arguments against indicating 
genetic modification on labels appear 
rather untenable. A consumer choice 
can only be free if it is well-informed, 
and there is no reason why consumers 
should not be aware of the technolog-
ical manipulation of the food they 
buy. The question has nothing to do 
with the safety of the technology. 
After all, if the sweater you are about 
to buy is synthetic rather than cash-
mere you would like to know - not 
because you have something against 
synthetic sweaters, but simply 
because you don't want to pay $300 
for an item that is worth one-tenth 
that amount. 

Similarly, if genetic modification 
represents potential savings in food 
production (as the industry is claim-
ing), consumers have a right to know 
how much of the savings the manu-
facturer is passing on to them. 

The questions of the safety and the 
usefulness of genetically modified 
food are more serious. The usefulness 
of genetic manipulation has been 
boasted from various angles: From the 
fact that genetic modification reduces 
the amount of pesticides necessary in 
agriculture (and is therefore good for 
the environment) to the fact that it will 
allow cheaper, more copious and 
more stable production and will ulti-
mately help fight world hunger. 

This argument is a major point of 
contention in Europe, as witnessed by 
the recent article of Xavier Pastor 
(director of GreenPfilce E~JKls) in the 

Madrid newspaper EI Pais nA inge-
nitrla gtnJtiCJI incremtntar6 el hambre," 
EI Pais, Nov. 1, 1999). Pastor's argu-
ment is very Simple: The enthusiasm 
toward genetically modified food 
comes from the incorrect opinion that 
the problem of world hunger is 
caused mainly by insufficient food -
that is, that it is essentially a techn0-
logical problem. 

In reality, there is enough food in 
the world to feed everybody. The pro-
duction of wheat afone would be 
enough to give every human a diet of 
3,soo calories per day. There is so 
much food, in fact, that in many 
developed nations producers receive 
government subsidies to reduce their 
production to prevent prices from 
falling too low. 

The problem is not the production 
of food, but its availability and an eco-
nomic system that demands scarcity 
to promote prices. In other words, the 
problem is political, not technological 
and the introduction of genetically 
modified crops will do nothing to 
solve these problems. To think other-
wise would be to fall again into the 
trap of thinking that technology can 
solve political problems. This point of 
view supports the old "pie" solution 
(if the pie is unevenly distributed, just 
make a bigger pie). The argument for-
gets that, in general, the people who 
had the biggest piece to begin with 
will take most of the extra as well. 

All the technological advances in 
agriculture of the last 40 years have 
not resulted in any significant 
improvement of the quality of We in 
poor countries. Quite the contrary, in 
fact: The gap between the standard of 
living of the rich and that of the poor 
has had a tenfold increase. There is no 
reason to think that genetic manipula-
tion will have any effect other than 
concentrating the control of food pro-
duction even more in the hands of the 
developed countries that own the cru-
cial technology at the expense of 
underdeveloped and developing 
countries.

isolated incidents and deny that their home-
town is more racist than anywhere else. 

According to the Anti-Defamation 
League, Santee is mid-range in its n.u.rnber 
of hate crimes compared to other cilles In 
San Diego County. In 1997, there we~ four 
hate crimes in Santee out of a populahon of 
around 55,304 people, or 0.72 hate crimes 
per 10,000 people. The city of San Diego, for 
example, had 0.48 per 10,000 and Vista had 
0.49 per 10,000, but San Marcos had 0.82 per 
10000 and Lemon Grove had 1.21 per 
10;000 because of their small populations. 

Santee does have hate crime. I'm not 
denying that. It's something the city is w.ork-
ing on. It's just that when 1 hear the refram of 
"Klantee" spouted as far a.way as La JolI~, I 
feel that this exaggeration IS nearly as prt!Ju-
diced as repeating racial jokes. You may 
argue that you don't really believe the stereo-
type, but when you repe~t it often enough it 
convinces others and, ulhmately, yourself. 

As I said, my hometown does have hate 
crime; we do have racism 
and bigotry, but so does 
every other city. If one One of the major

ever since.

'Tis The Season to Riot 
COMMENTARY: Holiday looting is a lot easier than shopping 
By IIRTRAND FAN 
Senior St." ~t6f 

Necessity may be the mother of invention, 
but if you really think about it, you'll find 
that there is a universal solution for all needs. 
Something that's already been invented and 
implemented from as far back as I can 
remember. Everyone needs something. 
Personally, I need a new Tv. some new 
clothes and some Christmas tree ornaments. 
The guy sitting next to me needs some Ritalin 
(or he needs to take smaller doses, I can't real-
ly tell). But all of these needs can be fulfilled 
by a single event - a riot. 

Now some might say that a job will ~1so 
suffice, but think about the amount of time 
you need to hold a job before you actually 
start producing money. First, you ha~e to 
apply for the job, then you ~ve ~n I~!er­
view where you answer questions like, Do 
you have any questions about the compa-
ny?" and you ~y, "You guys sell" b~gel~; 
right?" and the Intervlewe~ says, Right,. 
and you both sit there feelmg dumb - It 
doesn't matter that the employer feels 
dumb, but you feel dumb and he knows it. 

After that, you have to get work clothes, 
find a means of transportation to get to work 
and then - the worst part of all- you must 
actually work. Then you have to go to the 
bank and cash your paycheck and run to the 
mall before it closes so you can buy.the stuff 
you wanted in the first place. ThIS whole 
process could take up to a month. 

Well, I don't have a month. I need 
Christmas tree ornaments now. And 
Christmas tree omaments are pretty, damn 
expensive. It'll cost you somewhere. in the 
vicinity of $5 for a decent ornament. Five dol-
larsl That's like an hour of work. Imagme 
working an hour for every ornament you 
want on your tree. 11lat's ridiculous. . 

A riot, on the other hand, IS much qUlcke.r. 

Starbucks wondering why there's a big hole 
in the window and people drop their double 
espresso Iattes with a shot of vanilla, proceed 
to the establishmenfnext to it, smash that 
window and luot it. It doesn't even have to 
sell Ouistmas tree ornaments, because every 
store in La Jolla has a Christmas tree sitting in 
the comer. Just take as many as you want and 
get the hell out of there. 

Let's compare the time comm.itment. You 
can work for a week, or riot for an hour. And 
rioting is fun! It doesn't just so!ve materia~is-
tic issues, it solves boredom ISSUes. You ve 
got nothing to do next Wednesday night? 
Riot. Need to take a break from studying for 
finals? Riot for half an hour. It's just like 
going shopping, except shopping in.v0lyes 
swiping your credit card and sl~nlng 
receipts, which is just too .t~e consum~g: 

Rioting isn't just an mdlvldual achvlty, 
either. Bring some friends. There's nothing 
quite like tearing up a city block for ~aking 
good friends better fnends. And nots are 
also a great place to meet girls. "H.ey, we're 
both setting the same store on fire! How 
funny, we have something in common. You 
want to go loot some mocha frappuccinos? 
All this tear gas is starting to get to me." 

The best part about riots is that you real-
ly don't need a reason to start them. Look at 
Seattle: Do you think even half of the peo-
ple there have any idea what the acronym 
WTO stands for? All they know is "Free TV 
= Free TV." It's a pretty simple equation. 

The key to starting a riot is to get really' 
pissed off about something. Like not being 
able to get a computer in Espresso Roma. 
Just keep repeating it to yourself, In your 
head: The iMacs are being llsed ill Espresso 
Roma and 1 can 'I lise lliem. The iMacs are being 
llsed ',1 Espresso Roma and 1 can'l lise tliem. 
Then run out to the middle of Price Center 
and yell, "The iMacs are being used in 
Espresso Roma and I can't use them!"

Stop Naming Colleges After Dead People 
COMMENTARY: Sometimes it is best not to think too hard about names 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

A few years ago [ decided to 
check the etymology of my name, 
just on a whim. [ thought it might 
be nice if my name turned out to 
have some kind of linguistic sig-
nificance that was subconsciously 
guiding my destiny. I'd hate to 
think that the way I've turned out 
has been entirely my fault. 

"Brent" is actually a variation 
on the name "Brant." A brant is, 
in tum, a kind of arctic goose. [ 
had hoped that if [ was named 
after a bird it would at least be 
noteworthy for something other 
than clogging up airplane pro-
pellers. Oh well - at least [ was-
n't named after those little birds 
that peck food out of allig;'(vf;}! 
teeth. 

My surname, "Don," aside 
from being carefully camou-
flaged as a first name, has a slew 
of meanings. It denotes an impor-
tant personage in Spanish and 
Italian, having been derived from 
the Latin dominlls, meaning 
"Iord." In Britain it is the title of a 
fellow (not "fellow" in the sense 
of "some random guy," but rather 
"someone pursuing academic 
studies") at Oxford or 
Cambridge. It's also the title of a 
Mafia crime boss. For a while I 
was intrigued by the possibility 
that my family name meant that I 
was descended from a proud line 
of wise guys (not "wise guys" in 
the sense, "people who mouth off 
a lot," but rather, "big intimidat-
ing men with a predisposition 
toward breaking kneecaps"). 
Then [ remembered that it was 
my mother's side of the family 
that was Italian, so that idea was 
shot to hell. 

After reflecting on what [ had 
learned, I decided that this exer-
cise hadn't proven to be very sat-
isfying. It hadn't given me any 
insight into what my purpose in 
life was, although [ was left with 

the nagging sense that [ should be 
studying ornithology in England 
and bossing people around. 

Detennined to figure out what 
it all meant, [ asked my mom how 
she and my dad chose my first 
name. "No reason," she said, 
shrugging. "[t just sounded nice." 

Works for me. [n fact, the more 
[ think about it, the more logical a 
system of naming things from an 
aesthetic standpoint seems. If dis-
approving parents, unpleasant 
collection agents and conde-

Of course, when the 
college actually opens in 
2002 the interim name 
will be "Your Name Here 
For A $5 Million Donation 
College," but suggestions 
are already being 
proposed for a 
permanent moniker. 
scending judges are going to be

ant to listen to. 

As is often done when study-
ing human nature, we tum to ani-
mal experimentat;on for exam-
ples. The panda cub born at the 
San Diego Zoo this summer was 
recently named Hua Mei, which 
translates to "China USA." 
Nations abandoned the concept 
of intemational marriages as a 
means of improving relations a 
long time ago, but apparently it's 
still okay to traumatize animals 
by using them as tools of diplo-
macy. This thoughtless choice of a 
name has doomed the poor thing 
to a lifetime of relentless teasing 
by fellow pandas, who are 
already concocting plans to call 
the hapless infant "Moo Shu 
Hamburger" and "Little Yankee 
Raccoon." Believe me, peer pl'eS" 
sure is a big deal when there are 
only about a dozen members of 

your species left on the earth. 
An aesthetic approach to nam-

ing landmarks also has several 
advantages. With plans in the 
works for a siXth college at UCSD, 
a concerted effort to find a name 
for this new campus can't be far 
behind. As catchy as "Sixth 
College" may be, it won't stand 
for long. Of course, when the col-
lege actually opens in 2002 the 
interim name will be "Your Name 
Here For A $5 Million Donation 
College," but suggestions are 
already being proposed for a per-
manent moniker. 

[n the past, colleges have 
been named after figures who 
have embodied the ideals of that 
college. Influential First Lady 
Eleanor Roosevelt was chosen to 
represent the altruistic ideals of 
the humanities program at Fifth 
College. Naturalist John Muir 
was selected as an embodiment 
of the environmental ideals that 
would be taught at the campus 
that would bear his name. Chief 
Justice Earl Warren was selected 
to represent the relentless pur-
suit of science that typifies the 
engineers at Warren College '" 
okay, so my college is screwed 
up. Tell me something I don't 
know. . 

The curriculum at Sixth 
College will focus on the merger 
of art, culture and technology. As 
such, some likely namesakes 
include innovators who have 
pioneered the use of modem 
technology in their artistic medi-
um: film maker George Lucas, 
composer Danny Elfman and 
Bruce Nauman, the artistic 
genius whose neon sculpture 
atop the Charles Lee Powell 
Structural System Laboratory 
relentlessly berates UCSD stu-

de~ts for being bad peo{'le and 
induces seizures in a lucky few.

City has worked to 
reverse its reputation 
C ........ dfrom ...... 
them personally. One of them ran 
for class president - and won. 

In high school at West Hills 
(often branded "White Hills," 
much to our frustration), there 
were around 2,500 students and 
the number of African American 
students could be counted with-
out anyone taking off their 
shoes. It wasn't our fault we did-
n't know that many minorities. 
Even so, our athletic commis-
sioner and the homecoming 
queen of my senior class were 
African American. Everyone 
knew the homecoming queen 
and she was - and as far as [ 
know, still is - well liked. In an 
article in the Union-Tribune she 
described being insulted when 
she was youn6er, but she is a 
strong person and overcame that 
to provide a strong counter-
example to racist beliefs. She 
provided a role model for every-
one at our school and in the 
community as a whole. 

In an attempt to fight this 
undeserved image, my high 
school began a "Stop the Hate, 
Start the Unity" campaign, 
beginning with a march of a mile 
or so to Santee Lakes. We also 
gave letters to Colbert's former 
unit, an act which received 
much media attention (to the 
delight of our principal). Most of 
these letters came from the 
heart. I know mine did - and so 
did many of my classmates' let-
ters - but the forced sympathy 
grated on many students who 
felt our principal was using the 
situation as an opportunity to 
advance her reputation. We 
showed up en masse at the stu-
dent-initiated rally, however, far 
beyond groups such as the 
marching band and sports tearns 
whose coaches required them to 
attend. We all wore free shirts . 
for the occasion and it really felt 

Thursday, December 9, 1999 

like the students were banding 
together. 

Unfortunately, that was the 
extent of the "Stop the Hate" por-
tion of the principal's campaign, 
and we moved on to a very shaky 
"Start the Unity" phase, marked 
by the develor,ment of a few 
clubs such as 'Random Acts of 
Kindness" and a slight increase in 
attendance to the "Color Me 
Human" club. This club had been 
in existence since my freshman 
year and held a "Pledge Against 
Prejudice" twice a year, which 
consisted of large groups of pe0-
ple using magic markers to draw 
around their hands and sign their 
names in an effort to get safety 
pins with black, brown, white, 
red and yellow ribbons on them. [ 
currently sport an older one on 
the antenna of my car, a testimo-
ny to the added practicality of 
being anti-racist. 

One of the most interesting 
portiOns of the campaign entailed 
talks at our school by a man 
named T.J. Leyden. He was a for-
mer recruiter for neo-Nazi hate 
groups and had at that time been 
covered with derogatory tattoos. 
He spoke to the student body 
about his experiences in the 
group and his realization that 
such groups not only threaten 
and endanger minorities, they 
also destroy the psyches and even 
the lives of their members. 

While doing research for this 
article, I searched local newspa-
pers, expecting to find somethmg 
resembling a vast media conspir-
acy against Santee, accusing us of 
racism and hatred, but found 
nothing save a few frustrated 
retractions to well-intentioned 
articles that were misunderstood. 
It appears that there is merely a 
small group of people perpetuat-
ing the turn of phrase that 
includes the word NKlantee." 1 
guess my plea is: Whoever it is, 
cut it out. We have no more 
racism than other towns in San 
Diego, we're just more aware of 
it. Put down your rocks and rein-
force your own walls of glass.

Herbal Remedies Have Many Uses 
Editor: 

This letter is a response to 
Cassandra Pierce's article 
("Herbal Remedies May Not Be 
All That," Dec. 2) 

I agree with the author on her 
major points: Many users of 
herbal treatments have incom-
plete knowledge of the herbs, that 
the lack of regulation leads to 
varying levels of quality and that 
pills in pretty bottles seem safe to 
consume. 

I disagree with the general 
conclusion of the article, that the 
alternative (Western medicine) is 
any better. At the risk of oversim-
plifying, let me point out two 
common problems with Western 
medicine. 

Western doctors and ~erbalists 
can be equally ignorant about 
treatments from their respective 
disciplines. For example, anti-
depressants have been all the rage 
in the last two decades, yet the 
field of psychopharmacology is 
still in its infancy. Recent studies 
have suggested that prolonged 
usage of anti-depressants in chil-
dren cause a higher propensity 
toward violence. 

Second, many of the most 
important or commonly used 
drugs are derived from the very

sands of years.

As a result of prolonged per-
secution, much herbal knowl-
edge has been lost forever. This 
is due to the profound arrogance 
that newly invented methods 
are superior to age-old knowl-
edge. It is ironic that the new 
doctors "prove" the superiority 
of their art by comparing it to 
the fragments of herbal knowl-
edge that still remain. Now that 
the traditional complete systems 
of medicine are lost, we have no 

choice other than to continue to 
develop the brand-new and 
incomplete Western medicine. 
History forgotten is doomed to 
be repeated.

Intramural Sports 
Are More Important 
Editor, 

As a graduate of UCSD (1970), 
[ was disappointed to see the 
recent large increase in intercolle-
giate sports budgets. I sympa-
thize with the coaches, but as a 
faculty member for the last 12 
years [ have seen little good from 
intercollegiate sports and much 
harm, both for students and for 
academic programs. 

At San Diego State University 
the athletic department recently 
sucked $5 million out of the gen-
eral fund, money that should 
have been spent on computers, 
books and journals. One of the 
most courageous efforts of the 
student body at UCSD was 
defeating the drive for a large-
scale intercollegiate football pro-
gram in the 1960s. This saved the 
campus millions of dollars and 
has helped lead to the academic 
excellence we now expect from 
UCSD. I would suggest that 
UCSD phase out all intercolle-
giate sports and support the 
intramural programs that benefit 
students instead.

There is alao no evidence that genetic modifica-
tion will significantly reduce the use of pesticides 
and increase production, arguments that many pro-
ponents of the technology regard as decisive. [n a 
year in which the use of genetically modified plants 
has increased by 145 percent in the United Slates, the 
use of pesticide increased slightly (about 1 percent). 
According to the department of agriculture, for 
instance, the yield of genetically modified soy is 4 
percent less than that of conventional soy, and the 
need for pesticides is almost doubled. 

Admittedly, there is no evidence of any serious 
problem due to genetically modified cultivation so 
far. However, chang~ in the DNA of crop par~sites 
have been observed In several cases. There IS still no 
assessment of the possibility that genetic modifica-
tion will spread upwards along the food chain, but 
the possible consequences of such a spread are too 
chilling to disregard.

[ would like to suggest a departure from the 
tradition of naming colleges after famous people 
and instead name future colleges according to the 
theme of the college. Considering that Sixth 
College will have a focus in the arts, I would like 
to propose the name "It's About Time, You Jerks 
College." Imagine the school spirit such a name 
would foster. The thought of a spirit match where 
the question "What college are you from?" results 
in a thousand undergrads screaming "It's About 
Time, You Jerks!" brings a tear to my eye. 

The point is, names are important, but if you 
put too much effort into trying to make them sym-
bolic, it usually backfires. A name shouldn't place 
any undue expectations upon the recipient. So 
leave the poor pandas alone, already.

Barak Halts Jewish Expansion NAZI: Germans deal with 
American laywers 

about $1 billion more than the 
current offer. 

Informal discussions and tele-
phone calls continue to take 
place, and both sides are under 
pressure to reach agreement. 
Groups representing Holocaust 
survivors fear that a long court 
battle would delay compensation 
until after many have died . 

JERUSALEM - As Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright was 
about to land here on Tuesday 
night, Ehud Barak, the prime 
minister of Israel, sought to 
defuse growing tensions with 
the Palestinians by fledging to 
halt the expansion 0 Jewish set-
tlements in the West Bank. 

Barak stopped short of 
declaring a freeze on construc-
tion, partly, and unsuccessfully, 
to avoid provoking the right-
wing members of his coalition. 
But he did call for a moratorium 
of several months on new settler 
neighborhoods to avert con-
frontation during a delicate peri-
od as the parties seek to reach 
the framework for a final peace 
agreement by Februa·ry. 

"There will be nothing on the 
ground," his spokesman, Gadi 
Baltiansky, said, expressing the 
decision more bluntly than the 
prime minister. "No bulldozers 
will work on the ground. There 
is no point in embarrassing or 
provoking the Palestinians." 

Still, Baltiansky acknowl-
edged that work already in 
progress, which was approved 
by the previous administration, 
might continue. "If there are four 
floors of a school built, I am not 

The Palestinians walked 
away from the 
negotiating table on 
Monday in protest of 
Barak's settlement policy, 
a move that the Israeli 
government initially 
described as a stunt to 
lure the Americans back 
into a salvage role in the 
two-way negotiations. 

saying that the fifth will not hap-
pen," he said. Israeli peace advo-
cates say that thousands of units 
are in the construction phase. 

Albright's impending visit 
appeared to catalyze a minor cri-
sis - and potential resolution -
between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. The Palestinians 
walked away from the negotiat-
ing t~ble on Monday in protest 
of Barak's settlement policy, a

Hockey Player, 15, Charged 
With Aggravated Battery 

CHICAGO - Prosecutors 
have charged a 15-year-old youth 
league hockey player with aggra-
vated battery, saying he slammed 
an opponent into the boards with 
his stick seconds after a game 
ended, leaving the player partly 
paralyzed. 

A spokesman for the Lake 
County state's attorney, George 
Strickland, said Wednesday 
that in a Nov. 3 game in subur-
ban Northbrook, the 15-year-
old, whose name was not 
released because he is a juve-
nile, "got up a head of steam" 
as he skated toward the oppos-
ing player, whose back was 
turned. 

The player who was charged 
was on the losing team, 
Strickland said, and the injured 
player, Neal Goss, 15, of Glencoe, 
had scored several goals. Goss 
has been unable to use the lower 
half of his body. 

Strickland also said that 
bystanders had told prosecutors 
that the accused youth taunted 
Goss, saying. "This is what you 

RIDDLE:

their parties in CA 
CoIdIMIed from ,..e 1 

But nobody in the political 
world seems inclined to call the 
March 7 California presidential 
primary anything but impor-
tant. In both parties, that contest 
will decide about 20 percent of 
the delegates nee<;led for the 
nomination, and the leading 
candidates all have Californians 
in crucial roles in their cam-
paigns. 

They all have spent substantial 
time here, not only raising money 
but also showing the flag in visits 
of up to 10 days at a stretch. At the 
moment, they aU may be braving

But Tht AssocUrttd Prtss report-

ed that Alan Kray, president of 
the Northbrook Hockey League, 
which sponsored the game, said 
several witnesses had thought 
there might still have been time 
left in the game when the boy was 
hit. 

"It happened within the con-
text of the game," Kray said. 

The charges have renewed an 
old debate over whether the 
actions of athletes on the arena ice 
or the playing field should be 
held to the standards of criminal 
law. Only a handful of profession-
al athletes and coaches have been 
charged with crimes over the 
years, and experts on sports say 
they do not know of any criminal 
charges being filed in a youth 
sports event. 

The youth hockey player was 
charged with two counts of bat-
tery, one for using "a deadly 
wea~n" and the other for inflict-
ing 'great bodily harm."

er here. "That it's a really big 
state, and it's really, really impor-

So far, the polls show Bush 
with more support here among 
Republican voters than all his 
Republican rivals combined and 
Gore with more than twice the 
level of Democratic support that 
Bradley draws. But the experts 
agree that those numbers could 
cflange quickly, depending on 
what happens in New 
Hampshire on Feb. 1. 

What is more, for the first time 
next year under a new system 
passed by voters here, the presi-
dential candidates in California 
will compete in a blanket prima-

flew into Israel, Barak apparent-
ly decided that the Palestinian 
concern was deep-seated and 
needed to be addressed. 

"We, in the course of the next 
three months, are in a critical 
political struggle, and therefore 
wisdom is needed and this gov-
ernment has that wisdom," Barak 
said in a brief news conference. 

Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian 
leader, and his aides were 
caught by surprise and initially 
didn't know quite how to react 
to Barak's declaration. But the 
settler leaders, with whom Barak 
has tried to build a cooperative 
relationship, immediately 
expressed their disappointment. 

"It turns out that Barak gives 
in to pressure and extortion and 
he has succumbed to the pres-
sure of Arafat and the 
Americans," said Benny 
Kashriel, the moderate leader of 
the Yesha Council, the settlers' 
umbrella organization. 

Alblight is scheduled to meet 
Barak at his residence for break-
fast on Wednesday, to meet 
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in 
Ramallah later in the day, and 
then perhaps to return to Barak 
for a second meeting.

Mrs. Clinton to Champion for Gays 
NEW YORK - Hillary 

Rodham Clinton told a group of 
gay contributors this week that 
the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, 
intended to make it easier for 
homosexuals to serve in the mil-
itary, had been a failure, her 
aides said Wednesday. 

Mrs. Clinton, a candidate 
for the U.S. Senate, said that if 
elected by New Yorkers she 
would work to overturn what 
was one of the first programs 
put in place under President 
Clinton. 

Mrs. Clinton, speaking at a 
fund-raiser in SoHo on Tuesday 
night, said that gays and les-
bians should be allowed to serve 
openly in the military, according 
to participants. 

Acknowledging that it was 
politically unrealistic to expect 
Congress to approve such legis-
lation now, she said the 
Pentagon should take steps to 
reduce the instances of gays 
being discharged from the mili-
tary. 

Mrs. Clinton's comments 
marked the first time she had 

publicly discussed her views 
about one of the more difficult 
episodes of her husband's first 

'.erm in office, according to Jeff 
Soref, the co-chairman of the 
Empire State Pride Agenda, a 
gay rights group, and an orga-

to a question posed at 
the fund-raiser, voiced

terms. 

nizer of the fund-raiser. 
The fight over Clinton's 

attempt to lift the ban on homo-
sexuals in the military - an 
attempt to fulfill a pledge he 
made as a candidate in 1992 -
dominated his first months in 
office, raising questions about the 
new president's competence and 
ideology, among both supporters 
and opponents of the ban. 

Clinton eventually abandoned 
the executive order, instead agree-

ing to legislation that permitted 
gays and lesbians to serve in the 
military providing they did not 
disclose or act upon their sexuali-
ty, and prohibiting the military 
from initiating unfounded 
inquiries about homosexuality. 

That approach ended up 
angering many of the people 
Clinton had set out to please in 
the first place. 

Mrs. Clinton, responding to a 
questionJosed at the fund-rais-
er, voice her displeasure with 
the policy in unequivocal terms, 
according to participants. 

There were mu rmurs of 
approval and soft applause as 
she described "don't ask, don' t 
tell" as a failure, taking note of 
the fact that there has been an 
increase in the number of gays 
expelled from the military 
since the policy was put in 
force. 

Gay groups 5<1y that since the 
policy was put into effect, the 
number of such discharges has 
doubled, to 312 last year.

New York Teachers and Principals Help 
Students Cheat on Math and Reading Tests 

NEW YORK - School inves-
tigators on Tuesday charged that 
dozens of teachers and two prin-
cipals across New York City's 
public school system had helped 
students cheat on the standard-
ized reading and mathematics 
tests that help determine how 
schools are ranked and whether 
students move on to the next 
grade. The cheating incident 
appears to be one of the largest 
in the recent history of 
American public schools, the 
investigators said. 

At some schools, teachers 
and principals let students mark 
their answers on scrap or note-
book paper then told the them 
which answers to correct when 
they filled in the bubbles in the 
official test booklets, the investi-
gators said. At others, they 
directed students to erase incor-
rect answers, or even changed 

the answers themselves. The 
investigators said that in a par-
ticularly egregious case, the 
principal of one public school in 
the Bronx had used all three 
methods to improve the test 

They directed students to 
erase incorrect answers, 
or even changed the 
answers themselves. 

scores of third graders. 
Students' performance on the 

tests improved remarkably at 
many of the schools, and two 
were even removed from a 
statewide list of failing schools, 
said Edward Stancik, the special 
investigator for New York City 
schools. 

"Their purpose was simply to 
improve their own reputations 

and further their own careers by 
creating the illusion that they 
were doing a good job," Stancik 
said Tuesday after releasing a 
report that laid out the evidence 
against the teachers and princi-
pals. "The Board of Education 
has failed to do an effective job 
in uncovering or punishing 
cheating." 

The charges of widespread 
cheating between 1995 lind this 
year - against 32 elementary 
and middle schools, 43 teachers, 
two principals and two parapro-
fessionals - come at a time when 
educators are under unprece-
dented pressure to improve stu-
dent performance nationwide. 

The pressure has been partiC-
ularly intense in New York City, 
where many students are per-
forming below grade level.

DAVIS, Calif. - Cheaters 
beware - a new Web site 
designed to root out plagiarism 
in college writing threatens to 
put online paper brokers out of 
business for good. 

The site, Plagiarism.org, was 
designed by UC Berkeley doc-
toral candidate John Barrie and 
is designed to check papers 
against a database of millions of 
online sites and pages - includ-
ing the papers of all schools par-
ticipating in the program - as a 
test of originality. Barrie's site is 
intended to catch both fully pla-
giarized papers and those with 
parts borrowed from other 
sources. 

According to the site, the sys-
tem is organized so that prdfes-
sors must have their students 
upload their papers to the pla-
giarism.org Web site. The site 
then electronically "finger-
prints" each paper and checks it 
against its database, using a 
computer algorithm to judge 
originality. 

The database's major focus is 
on what the Web site calls "online 
paper mills" such as 
CheatHouse.com and 
Cheater.com. 

Papers that simply use 
quotes will not be cited and are 
only flagged in "cases of gross 
plagiarism." Once a report is 
completed and plagiarism is 
found, the site provides the pro-
fessor with links to the five most 
similar pages to the offending 
paper. 

In response to questions about 
papers being accidentally 
flagged, the Web site says, "If 
your work was flagged as uno-
riginal then, depending on the 
originality score, it was probably 
not that original." 

Using the program comes at a 
price. Professors pay $20 to cre-
ate an account - which includes 
a free trial run of 30 papers -
and then pay an additional 50 
cents for every paper beyond the 
30th. 

Barrie got his inspiration for 
Plagiarism.org while working as 
a teaching assistant. He had his 
students post their papers on the 
Internet so that other students 
could review them. 

Afterward, Barrie caught 
wind that these papers were 
resurfacing in other classes with 
different students. To root out the 
plagiariSts, Barrie developed his 
program and tested it on a UCB 
class, where he found 15 percent 
of the papers to be unoriginal in 
some way. 

Plagiarism.org is gaining pop-
ularity among professors and 
universities at a time when acad-
emic dishonesty appears to be on 
the rise. Campuses around the 
country, including UCB, are con-
tracting the service and schools 
as far away as Britain have 
expressed interest in the pro-
gram.

THE BEST FILMS 
OF THE 

20TH CENTURY 
The Guardian steps up to the 

plate and delivers our picks for the best 
- movies of the past hundred years 

STORIES BY 

DAVID YEN, SINIOR SIAFF WRITIR

David's Top Rve Picks 
1. "The S ........ k Redemption" 

POSSibly the best movie of the '90s, Tim Robbins 
plays a wealthy banker wrongfully imprisoned for 
killing his wife. Through 20 years of pain and suf-
fering, Robbins' character manages to find salvation 
by creating a new world for himself and striking a 
friendship with Red, played masterfully by Acade-
my Award nominee Morgan Freeman. The colorful 
characters leap off the screen and the story pOignant-
ly conveys the extremes of human emotions. "The 
Shawshank Redemption" is more than an excellent 
prison movie. It is a movie about overcoming obsta-
cles, striving for greatness and seeing the good in 
people. It explores the difference between hope and 
fear and shows viewers the importa'lce of never giv-
ing up on dreams no matter wha! happens. 

2. "Titanic" 
Some people love this movie. Others love to hate 

it. But there is indeed something special about a 
film that grossed $600 million in domestic sales and 
won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. 
The truth about "Titanic" is that it may not have a 
great, or even, original story. Nonetheless, it single-
nandedly revived epic movie-making, showing 
Hollywood that risk-taking does payoff and people 
want to be entertained on various levels. Through 
an unforgettable score, splendid cinematography 
and solid performances made by Leonardo 
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, "Titanic" shows us that

Triple Your Pleasure 
A slew of light laughs despite steep ticket prices at the Gas/amp 
By ILONA FASS 
Senior Staff Writer 

If "Triple Espresso" is any indi-
cation of what San Diego audiences 
enjoy watching, then it seems as 
though the recipe for creating a 
successful show here is parking a 
few friends on stage to reminisce 
about past blunders. (Think "For-
ever Plaid" moves to coffee house.) 

Theater snobs will tell you that 
"Triple Espresso" lacks originali-
ty and drips with cheese. The less 
pretentious might tell you that it 
is enjoyable - and it is. If you 
don't mind that it lacks originali-
ty, then you are guaranteed to 
enjoy the hopped-up antics and 
amusing skits. 

"Triple Espresso" is meant for 
family and tourists seeking light 

entertainment; be prepared to 
clap your hands and sing along. 
But despite the innate hokeyness 
of it all, Buzz MaxWell, Hugh But-
ternut and Bobby Bean - the 
stars of the show - are funny 
c;haracters that succeed in per-
forming entertaining skits. 

Dane Stauffer's portrayal of 
Butternut, the smarmy lounge 
musician wired on caffeine, is 
hilarious. Bobby Bean {Duane 
Daniels), the goofy one, builds his 
performance with expertly 'Crafted 
facial expressions and by master-
ing physical comedy (kudos to his 
gorilla impersonation.) Lastly, 
Buzz, played by Scott Cervine and 
modeled after real-life comedi-
an/musician Bill Arnold, has per-
fected the art of deadpan delivery. 
In short, the three performers 

PREP COURSES 

work well together and have a 
great sense of comedic timing. 

As long as you don't mind the 
steep price, the show's light, inof-
fensive humor lands it smack in the 
middle of the "Safe Date Zone." In 
addition, its downtown San Diego 
location is convenient for topping 
off the evening in one of the nearby 
restaurants or night clubs. 

Without a doubt, "Triple 
Espresso" provides the perfect 
venue to park your face in the 
smile position for two hours. So 
forgo Starbucks for a few days, 
and save your pennies for a 
"Triple Espresso" instead. 

"Triple Espresso" is now play-
ing at the Horton Grand Theatre 
in the Gaslamp Quarter. For more 
information, call the box office at 
(619) 234-9583.

MOVIES: 
"Star Wars" 
epitomizes greatness 

"Citizen Kane" takes viewers on 
an incredible journey into the 
life of an extraordinary man, 
through the good, the bad and 
the ugly. It reminds viewers that 
while people are constantly 
changing, some things remain 
the same and that some princi-
ples should never be sacrificed. 
Based loosely on the life of jour-
nalist William Randolph Hearst, 
"Citizen Kane" begins with the 
simple premise of investigating 
a dying mogul's last words. 
From then on, viewers are pro-
pelled on a dazzling and com-
plex quest much similar to the 
pursuit for the meaning of life. 
In the end, we are treated to sim-
plicity once again. Somehow, 
thanks to the genius of Welles, 
everything makes perfect sense.

man forge a special bond as 
unlikely brothers in Barry levin-

man leading a complicated life. 
Cruise and Hoffman contrast 
and complement each other per-
fectly. Cruise's charactrr is the 
selfish playboy who learns to 
care for others. Hoffman's char-
acter appears unable to distin-
guish between right and wrong. 
The movie shows that people 
will never know who tHey are 
going to meet or what impact 
they will have on each others' 
lives. Th~ bittersweet end illus-
trates that people ought to take 
advantage of their opportunities 
before they are gone.

5. UOne Flew Over the 
Cuckoo'. Nest' 

This movie is shaped and 
fueled by Jack Nicholson, who 
gives one of the greatest perfor-
mances in film history as a men-
tal patient, Randle McMurphy. 
In the film, McMurphy is volun-
tarily institutionalized in a ward 
where the inmates are physical-
ly and psychologically abused 
by a nursing staff that constant-
ly abuses its authority. The 
beauty of this Milos Forman 
film is that it breaks stereotypes, 
portraying the mental patients 
as sensitive, real individuals 
who are often more 'sane' than 
the people in the real world . We 
are left to question whether the 
people are crazy to begin with, 
or if society dictates who we 
become and what is considered 
acceptable behavior. Maybe all 
of us are a little crazy at heart.

No other film in the history 
of motion pictures can hold a 
candle to George Lucas' 1977 
space-epic. It is the story of a 
young moisture farmer living 
on the most barren, desolate 
planet in the galaxy who comes 
to understand his true destiny 
and his role in the battle to save 
the galaxy from the evil galactic 
empire. Mark Hamill, Harrison 
Ford, Carrie Fisher and Alec 
Guiness made the film not only 
believable but fun as well. Of 
course the true genius of the 
film lies with its creator George 
Lucas. This film redefined 
motion pictures with respect to 
storytelling and special effects 
Wizardry and influenced an 
entire generation of younger 
audiences to believe in the awe-
some power of the movies.

Traditional Holiday Show Gets Modern 
The San Diego Repertory Theatre adds comtemporary sensibilities to classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge 
By JESSICA SCHEPPMANN 
Senior Staff Writer 

To present an older play that 
has been around for generations, 
from a fresh perspective presents 
a specia l type of problem. Com-
bined wi th the fact that Charles 
Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" is a 
holiday trad ition, makes the orig-
inal job done by the Repertory 
Theatre is especially outstanding. 

The Repertory Theatre at the 
Lyceum in Horton Pla za has 
taken classic characters such as 
Ebenezer Scrooge, Bob Crachit, 
and Tiny Tim and presented them 
in a 1990s perspective, combining 
traditional story with turn of the 
century innovation and creativity. 

Marshall senior Beth Arnese 
felt that play really got her into 
the spirit of the holidays. 

"A 'Christmas Carol' can come 
off as stale when it isn't done 
properly, but this version was 
original and funny." 

This version of "A Christmas 
Carol" was adapted by D.W. 
Jacobs and directed by Sean Mur-
ray, who is also the artistic direc-
tor of North Coast Repertory The-
atre. 

Murray wanted to bring a new 
perspective to "A Christmas 
Carol" for the audience. 

"We speak to the audience as if 
'A Christmas Carol' is a new play, 
never-before-seen," said Murray. 
"The reason that this story has 
been around for so long and in so 
may forms is because it speaks to 
us as individua ls and resonates 
fo r all of us. It is a yea rly reminder 
to look at our lives, pur joys and 
heartbreaks, and reaffirm that we 
are an integral part of society." 

Perhaps the best part of the 
story was the banter between the 
narrator (Douglas Roberts) and 
Scrooge (Jonathan McMurtry). 
Their interaction adds a lot of 

COUltesy of the SaIl Die60 Rep/lftory The«1e 
Scr~ecI: Jonathan McMurty plays Ebenezer Scrooge (right) in the San Diego Repertory Theatre's production of "Charte's Dickens' A Christmas Carol.· 

humor to the play and balances the 
nastiness of Scrooge's character 
early on in the play, keeping the 
character appealing. Robert effec-
tively integrates his narration of 
the story into the show and gives 
an added perpsective to the story-
line and the characters of the play. 

Scrooge is brought to life by 
McMurtry, who has played Scrooge 
at the Repertory Theatre in years 
past. The makeup and costume 
combined with McMurtry's talent 
make Scrooge seem to leap to life 

out of a cartoon. McMurtry seems 
built to portray Scrooge, who starts 
out an old and decrepit grouch 
whose only delight comes t1:om the 
misery of others and ends up giv-
ing an endearing portrayal of 
redemption. The effective prop 
changes, costumes and the intimate 
glimpse we see of Scrooge's vulner-
able younger years make the char-
acters endearing and welcoming. 

The cast is multi-dimensional 
and ethnically diverse, contribut-
ing to the fresh perspective that 

this version gives to this a time-
less tale. Murray's cast transports 
the audience through Scrooge's 
life with the Ghosts of Christmas 
past present and future. 

Besides Roberts' and 
McMurtry's characters, perhaps 
the best peformance is given by 
Lamont Thompson, who plays 
the Ghost of Christmas/resent. 
Standing on platforme shoes, 
with a long orange robe and 
dredlocks, Thompson shows both 
the joy of the season and the sad-

ness that Scrooge's penny-pinch-
ing ways .have caused. It's an 
original interpretation that gives 
the character a new dimension 
that isn't usually seen. 

"A Christmas Carol" contin-
ues at San Diego Repertory The-
atre through December 24. Ticket 
prices are $19-$27, December 3-

Album Reviews 

Dr.Dr. 
Dr. Ore 2001 

--,,---
-

*** It was back in 1988 when 
N.W.A. first emerged with 
"Straight Oulla Compton," 
shocking the music world with 
their no-holds-barred, tell-it-like-
it-is attitude. Along the way, the 
group sparked a lot of controver-
sy while launching the careers of 
Ice Cube and Andre Young (a.k.a. 
Or. Ore). It was N.W.A. that first 
helped create a new musical 
genre called "gangsta rap." 

This new rap genre went 
against authority and the main-
stream, but most of all it gave 
many young Americans a type of 
music that they could finally 
relate to. The group expressed 
what had been on the minds of 
many but few had dared to 
voice. When N.W.A. split up, 
they had already left their mark 
on the rap world . Now there was 
no turning back, and as the '80s 
ended and the '90s began, so did 
the solo careers of Ice Cube and 
Dr. Dre. 

It's hard to believe that it's 
been seven years since Dr. Dre 
released his ground-breaking 
triple-platinum solo album Till' 
Chrollie, a record that Spill maga-
zine voted the eighth best of the 
decade. (Spi" also voted The 
Chro"ie"s "Nuthin But A G-
Thang," the best Single of the 
'90s.) Since then Ore kept busy 
constructing such projects as 
Snoop Dog's quintuple-platinum 

MOVIES: 
"Singin' in the Rain" 
is a great musical 

2.~ .... Kane". 
It's an easy-out to list OrsoJl 

Welles' masterpiece on any top-
films list, but that's simply 
because it's so damn good. 
Through its creative approach 
toward the narrative, the film 
slowlr winds its way through the 
life 0 the century's most power-
ful, yet sadly empty, man. The 
story and the title character are a 
thinly veiled reflection of the 
newspaper giant William Ran-
dolph Hearst who fought the 
film's release with all his influ-
ence, ultimately ruining Welles' 
future in Hollywood. However it 
is Welles' creative brilliance and 
charismatic acting that make this 
film a true classic. 

3. "5c:hIndIer'l Usr 
The greatest director of our 

time has created many films wor-
thy of being recognized for their 
humanity and their greatness, 
but none quite compare to the 
terrifyingly painful realism that 
Steven Spielberg creates in 
"Schindler's Ust." The story of 
an opportunistic German indus-
trialist turned savior serves as the 
plot in a film that dramatically 
portrays the atrocities committed 
against the Jews during World 
War II. Few films are able to 
evoke so much emotion and sad-
ness as Spielberg'S tragiC holo-
caust drama. 
4.Mfhe ....... 
. Stanley Kubrick takes Stephen 

album Ooggystyle, 2 Pac's Califor-
Ilia Lotlt', and recently, the Slim 
S/lQdy LP disc for Eminem. 

Besides providing a gene r ,,-
tion with musical "anthems" they 
could relale to, Dre was bold 
enough to endorse a white rapJ?l:r 
from Detroit called Eminem. (He 
let talent decide Eminem's fate, 
not skin color.) 

After going against authority 
and cutting across color lines, the 
only thing left to do for this 
groundbreaking rapper /produc-
er was to release another solo 
album. With the Nov. 9 release of 
Dr. Ore 2001, Ore is still "keepin 
heads ringin' ." Dr. Ore 2001 fea-
tures Snoop Dogs, Nate Dogs, 
Eminem and Mary J. Blige to 
name just a few. 

The album features explosive 
tracks like "Forgot About Ore" 
(featuring Eminem) and "Bang 
Bang" (featuring Knoc turn'al 
and Hittman). "Forgot about 
Ore" showcases the talent of 
Eminem while giving Dre an 
opportunity to tell the world that 
he hasn't disappeared. In the 
track "Bang Bang," Ore takes his 
listeners on an unrelenting high-
energy journey into the reality of 
the hood. 

Seven years after his debut, 
Dre has grown as an artist. Unfor-
tunately, the profanity is still 
there and at times it grows tire-
some. Beneath all the expletives, 
Dre has a unique voice that isn't 
truly heard until the last track of 
the album. On the heartfelt "The 
Message," Dre finally has an out-
let for the pain caused by the 
senseless death of his younger 
brother. (His brother was killed 
for no greater reason than being 
in the wrong place at the wrong 
time.) "The Message" is conveyed 
with the help of powerful vocals 
by Mary). Blige and Rell . 

This is an emotionally charged 
album that uses both tragedies 
and humor to get its message 
across. If anything, talent~d 

King's gripping horror story and 
brilliantly transforms it into a ter-
rifying motion picture. This film 
owes much of its greatness to its 
amazing interior settings (which 
were built specifically for the 
film) as :-veil as Kubrick's fantasti-
cally creepy cinematography 
(which took advantage of the 
set's intricacies and abundant 
size). However the element 
which really makes this film note-
worthy is the performance of Jack 
Nicholson as the custodian of a 
remote mountain lodge who is 
slowly driven insane and ulti-
mately tries to kill his family. 

5 ... AnnIe ...... 
Comedy abounds in Woody 

Allen's "nervous" romance about 
a Jewish comedian trying to find 
love in the Big Apple. Allen and 
co-star Diane Keaton effectively 
portray a very believable couple 
complete with all the hang-ups 
and neurosis which define a 
Woody Allen movie. "Annie 
Hall" is about finding love and 
losing it again but most impor-
tantly about what happens in-
between. The film conveys those 
experiences so effectively that it's 
nearly impoSSible to come away 
from the movie without feeling 
better about your own love life 
having watched it. 

Julia's Top Rve Picks 
1. "Sf .... n' In the Rain" 

It's easy to see why a genera-
tion of women fell in love with 
Gene Kelly while watching "Sin-
gin' in the Rain." The man exudes 
charisma as he effortlessly dances 
his way through the film in a 
Uniquely athletic style. The story 
revolves around Don Ldt:kwood 

The UCSD Guardian 

comedian Eddie Griffin gets the 
message of the album across as he 
speaks his mind on the track 
"Edu-cation." 

With all the talent on Dr. Ore 
2001, it seems as though the "Dr." 
has operated on another plat-
inum effort.

**** For months, antsy Death 
epthusiasts have been teased by 
rumors of the release date of Con-
trol Denied's debut release, The 
Fragile Art of Existtllce, which is 
finally available for Chuck 
Schuldiner fans. 

Death's lead guitarist, 
Schuldiner, spearheaded the con-
ception of Control Denied and 
managed to include an all-star 
cast, at its inception in 19%. This 
new side project band promised 
much and has delivered. The wait 
was well worth it. Schuldiner was 
looking for a cleaner, more. 
melodic and traditional sound of 
metal with this album, while still 
keeping Death's precision, inten-
sity and depth. 

Along with Schuldiner, the 
lmeup consists of vocalist Tim' 
Aymar (formerly of Psycho 
Scream), drummer Richard 
Christy and guitarist Shannon 
Hamm '(both joined Death for the 
So""d of PerselJerance LP). Eventu-
ally, legendary bass player Steve 
Digorgio was added to the team, 

(Kelly) and Una Lamont (a hilari-
ous Jean Hagen), two silent 
movie stars who must adapt to 
the new talking movie craze. 
Lockwood's sidekick is the fan-
tastic Cosmo Brown (Donald 
O'Connor). "Singin' in the Rain" 
is worth seeing just to watch 
O'Connor dance up a wall while 
singing "Make 'em Laugh." 

2. "Gone WIth .... WInd" 
Sixty yeare; after its release, 

this movie still has the power to 
draw people in, incite intense 
debate and make just about 
everyone mourn the loss of 
Southem dignity. It's impossible 
not to care for Scarlet O'Hara 
(Vivian Leigh), even though she 
has to be one of the most snotty 
characters ever to grace the 
screen. Ultimately, "Gone With 
the Wind"'s greatness isn't 
derived from its vast sets, beauti-
ful cinematography or memo-
rable acting. Instead, the movie 
has withstood the test of time 
because it tells a fantastic story, 
one that is sure to delight audi-
ences for generations to come. 

3. "Sound of MusIc:IM8ry 
PoppIns" (The J ... Andre .. 
.. NMny Collection) 

Julie Andrews has spent the last 
35 years trying to shed her nanny 
image. However, the fact is that she 
was born to playa singing, enthu-
siastic and quick-witted babysitter. 
In "Sound of Music," she spices up 
a movie that could have easily been 
sleep-inducing. By doing so, she 
helps one of the greatest stories 
ever told thrive on the big screen. 
In "Mary Poppins," Andrews pro-
vides depth and seriousness to a 
movie that could have easily 
turned into an extended cartoon.

. ,-

making Control Denied one of 
the best metal bands of the centu-
ry. Tilt' Fragile Art of ExistPllce is 
the purest form of "guitar wiz-
ardry" this earth has to offer. 

Schuldiner writes from the 
depths of his emotions, convey-
ing melodic, poignant messages. 
He composed the killer melodies, 
shredding riffs and thought-pro-
voking lyrics. The second the 
album starts, it opens with a 
mind-boggling guitar lick, as if 
listeners are being raided by a 
swarm of buzzing bees. 

In the song "When the Link 
Becomes MiSSing," Hamm and 
Schuldiner share the spotlight as 
the song slows down, and they 
each begin their solos, showing 
off their extremely nimble fingers. 
The title track, "The Fragile Art of 
Existence," plays for over nine 
minutes, but there is never a dull 
moment. The guitars are in con-
stant duel with the double bass 
drums, throwing even the skeptic 
tap out of rhythm on his dash-
board. 

It is said that art imitates life. 
In the song "Expect the Unex-
pected," it says that "when life 
seems to be complete, [it) comes 
and knocks us off our feet. " After 
completing this album, Schuldin-
er was diagnosed with cancer 
and is currently undergoing 
chemotherapy. We have enjoyed 
his musical artistry for 16 years 
and can only hope for the best 
possible outcome to this horrible 
occurrence. Without Schuldiner, 
Control Denied and Death would 
have been mere dreams, floating 
around in imaginations of tho e 
who would have been oblivious 
to what they were missing out 
on. 

Easily, Control Denied's first 
album has become an instant 
favorite and we welcome it to the 
list of "trend-free metal." In 
Schuldiner's own words, "let the 
metal flow." 

- Talar Parunyan 

She makes us believe in the power 
of imagination and love. Both films 
would have been merely good 
without the delightful Andrews, 
but with her presence, they are 
transported to a higher level. 

4. "The Princes. Bride" 
As the greatest sword fighting 

movie of all time, "The Princess 
Bride" clearly belongs in any list 
of top movies. From Cary Elwes' 
dashing performance as Westley 
to Mandy Patinkin's heart-
wrenching turn as Inigo Mon-
toya, this movie contains some of 
the greatest comedic acting ever. 
The story centers on Westley's 
attempt to save the Princess But-
tercup from marrying the evil, 
slick Prince Humperdinck (Chris 
Sarandon). Westley is accompa-
nied by Fezzik (the lovable Andre 
the Giant) and Inigo in his quest. 
Along the way, the group meets 
up with Miracle Max (Billy Crys-
tal) and his wife Valerie (Carol 
Kane) for a hysterical interlude. 
5. "The 1'I*cI M .. " 

This 1949 film is a fantastic por-
trayal of life in Vienna after the war 
when all hope and order has disap-
peared. The plot revolves around 
Holly Martins Goseph Cotten), a 
pulp fiction novelist, who comes to 
Vienna at the invitation of his old 
friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). 
Martins arrives in Vienna only to 
find that Lime has died in a bizarre 
car accident. He gets more and 
more curious about the circum-
stances of this accident and begins 
to inW!Stig<lte. What Lime finds 
shakes his very moral foundation, 
and has implications for what it 
means to be just in postwar Vienna.

Irreverant Dreams of a Ramblin' Man 
Year 2000 will bring the end of the world as we know it, but those prepared will be just fine 
By BEN GLEIBERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Considering that the world is 
ending in just 22 short days, it 
seems that everyone is taking it 
quite well. [ mean, you'd think 
there would be more of a fuss 
over the impending doom of 
existence as we know it. Maybe 
people don't want the end of the 
world to alter the way they nor-
mally live their lives or some-
thing. But that's not the way 1 
look at it. 

There is a vast array of things 
1 want to do before 1 die. I'm 
growing sad that I'm not going 
to be able to accomplish them 
all. Some may seem more 
important than others, but all 
equally significant in my eyes. 

I may never get the chance to 
fulfill my career goal of becom-
ing an international porn star by 
the name of Donnie Dang. 1 may 
never get the chance to market 
my very bendable, plastic Don-
nie Dang action figure . 

My research may never be 
completed, and the world will 
never get to take advantage of 
the first paper airplane that can 
actually carry passengers. It 
would have revolutionized the 
entire paper travel industry but 
will now have to go unseen for-

ever. 
1 have also been working on 

creating a tiny machine that peo-
ple can carry around with them. 
Utilizing what 1 call "digital" 
technology, they can speak to 
other people around the world. I 
plan on calling this invention 
"crazy wireless pocket machine 
phones." The greatest thing 
about these "pocket machine 
phones" is that people look real-
ly cool when using them in pub-
lic places like restaurants, lec-
tures and movie theaters. Also, 1 
just have a feeling that these 
"machines" will make people 
better drivers. 

I want to go in that cool-look-
ing Mormon temple on Nobel. I 
want to catch a 6-pound sea 
bass. I've caught as-pounder 
and a 7-pounder before, but 
somehow it just never seemed 
right. I want to win a gold medal 
in that stupid Olympic sport 
"curling," just so I can prove 
that it takes no skill at all. I want 
to dunk a basketball just once, 
without having my Dad lift me 
up so I can do it. Mostly because 
I think the thrill would be great, 
and because it's getting tough on 
my Dad's back. 

I dream of winning the 
Pulitzer prize for journalism, 
then writing an expose on how 

I always dreamed of 
winning the Pulitzer prize 
for journalism, then 
writing an expose on how 
the committee was totally 
unjustified in giving me 
the award. 
the committee was totally unjus-
tified in giving me the award. 
And that story will be SO good 
that I'd win another Pulitzer. 
Definitely no time left to achieve 
that one, but damn it, I tried. 

I'm almost done writing my 
screenplay which is the greatest 
love story ever told. It's about 
these two young people who 
meet on a big unsinkable ship 
and fall in love, but the ship 
sinks and one of them dies. I will 
probably set it in the old days 
just for effect. Mostly because 
people from the old days were 
overly dramatic and spoke in 
lame dialogue, so my script 
would be fitting. I will probably 
have a title song by a pompous 
French-Canadian singer who 
beats her chest like a monkey 
when she sings. 

I never lived on graham 
crackers and French dressing for 
a year, but I'm okay with that 

one because I know deep down 
that I could have done it. I also 
want to have the opportunity to, 
just once, sing so beautifully 
that it would make an entire 
room of kindergartners cry. I 
may still be able to achieve that 
one. 

I want to become a farmer 
somewhere in the Midwest 
plagued by infertile soil and 
have no businesses buy my crop. 
Then I could live on government 
subsidies. Along those lines, 1 
also want to move to the inner 
city, have 10 or 15 babies that I 
can't support and do my part to 
heIr drain the welfare system. I 
wil use very little of the money 
I get for each baby to actually 
raise the baby and instead use 
the rest to drink and buy nice, 
fashionable clothes. 

Also, we're never going to get 
to collect Social Security. 
Although, that probably would 
have been the same even if we 
were to live to retirement age. 

Some other things I'll never 
get to do are: become a pro base-
ball player and help the Angels 
or Cubs not make the World 
Series; invent a screensaver that 
looks exactly like the screen 
worked on; clone a human being 
using only styrofoam, cupcakes 
and the will to succeed; change 

my name to P.]. McStaplerstaff, 
or Phil Philerston; purchase a 
small island impulsively and 
then forget I bought it and never 
even open the wrapping; and 
finally, create peace on earth. 
That one I especially wanted to 
accomplish, because if I created 
peace on earth, I will be revered 
as some sort of emperor and 
make people do whatever I 
wanted. And if they didn't, I:d 
just bomb them or something. 
"Long Live Emperor Phil Philer-
ston!" they will cheer. Doesn't 
that have a nice ring to it? I 
guess it will just have to remain 
a dream. 

The only thing that has kept 
me from complete depression 
over this whole "end of the uni-
verse" thing is that despite all 
these lofty aspirations, my life's 
greatest goal has already been 
achieved. A while back I discov-
ered a little thing known as 
"electricity." While it hasn't had 
quite the impact 1 had hoped, it 
still is a noticeable achievement. 
Every time I look at the illumi-
nated skyline of a busy city after 
night fall, 1 can't help but feel a 
sense of inner warmth and 
accomplishment. I know that I 
will be remembered forever. All 
three weeks of it. 

By the way, happy new year!

COLUMN: 
Bowl season is 
completely worthless 
C ........ d".. ..... 24 
national championship game is 
the only game that mailers. Fans 
can completely forget the rest of 
bowl season; tum on the tube 
during primetime on Jan. 4 and 
what is being aired will be alI 
anyone needs to do to know the 
entire national championship 
picture. 

I remember when fans had to 
watch two or three games to fig-
ure out what was going on. 
When No. 4 beat No. 1 and No. 3 
beat No. 2, who should be the 
new No.1? There was nothing 
like the Jan. 2 controversy, in 
which one team was named the 
champion and the other team's 
manager would cry and moan 
incessantly about how his squad 
got gypped. 

Every once in a while, there 
was a tie for the national cham-
pionship. This happened a few 
years back when Nebraska and 
Michigan faced off, and before 
that to Washington and Miami, 
as weII as to Colorado and 
Georgia Tech. A tie for the 
national championship is the 
greatest co lIege footbaII situation 
- fans endulge in exciting trash-
talking about how one team wiII 
beat another and how it deserves 
the win. 

But that is alI gone now, 
thanks to greed masked behind 
the promise of improving the 
game. I will stilI watch the Sugar 
Bowl this year, but it will seem 
like something is miSSing. Happy 
holidays everyone, tilt one back 
over the break for me.

Late three pointer 
helps lift the Tritons 

throw shooting. After draining 
only 50 percent of its first-half 
free throws, UCSD connected 
Oll 80 percent of them in the sec-
ond half. Had the Tritons con-' 
tinued their poor shooting from 
the line in the second half, the 
outcome may not have been the 
same. 

UCSD was also dominant 
from behind the arc in the second 
half. The Tritons Icrunched 10 
three pointers in the first half and 
made only two of them. In the 
second half, the Tritons took nine 
three point shots and nailed four

time this season when they take 
on Christian Heritage Co lIege 
on Friday at 7 p.m. at RIMAC

The Tritons need a victory so

It was at this time last season that 
UCSD broke out of a beginning

incredible winning streak They 
will need to do this again to make

Get out to RIMAC Friday to

they can start up their first 
major winning streak of the sea-

ContInued from ,..e 24 

The Tritons were down even 
before they started to play. . 

"We were overmatched," 
Lanthier said. "It was a wonderful 
basketbal1 environment. They're 
an average DiVISion I tearn. It was 
a good experience for the kids. We 
didn't shoot really well." 

The Aggies are almost 
unbeatable at home, having won 
40 of their last 42 games at home. 
Head Coach Stew Morrill is 15-2 
at the Den Glen Smith Spectrum 
since becoming head coach at 
Utah State. 

The Aggies jumped out to an 

early 11-0 lead and never 
looked back The Tritons pulled 
the game to within 46-30 head-
ing into the half, but the Aggies 
had no worries. 

UCSD suffered from atro-
cious shooting at the start of the 
second harf, scoring only 2 
points in the first 9 minutes of 
the half. That is all Utah State 
needed to propel itself to a con-
vincing 82-58 victory. 

Cole Miller came off the bench 
to score 14 points and lead UCSD 
while teammate Michael Martin 
was the only other Triton to score 
double digits, scoring 11 points. 

The Aggies' Tony Brown and 
Troy Ro1\e each scored 16 pOints 
while teammate Shawn Daniels 
added 15 points. 

"They jumped out to an 11-0 
lead but we scrambled back," 

Lanthier said. "We pu1\ed it to 
within 46-30 at halftime, which 
is respectable. Then we only 
scored 2 points in the first 9 min-
utes of the second half. The out-
come was never in question." 

The Tritons take a 3-5 record 
heading into winter break, but 
they have played much better of 
late and the team seems to be 
coming together . 

"We need a little consisten-
cy," Lanthier said. "We have 
some young guys playing and 
we have not shot to our capabil-
ities. We need to shoot better." 

UCSD's next game is 
Saturday when they head to El 
Cajon to face Christian Heritage 
Co1\ege at 5 p.m. 

The Tritons play seven more 
games before they host the La

Reality

Women Win With a Late Surge 
Bill Burger 

Hns anybody noticed that 
the air seems to have a little 
bite to it lately? My friends 
back East keep telling me that 
a strange white substance 
keeps falling from the sky, ,lnd 
every morning I've noticed my 
windshield IS covered in J 
frozen sheet of slush. This 
could mean only one thlrtg: It's 
bowl sea~on agalll 111 college 
football! 

Although the next three 
\\ eeks used to be my favorite 
time of year as a sports fan, I 
must say that recent changes 
of the college bowl games 
have put quite a damper on 
my holIday football spirit . 

First of all, the powers that 
be have completely bas-
tardized the Idea of the bowl 
game. When you hJve teams 
such as ArI zona , tate and 
Wil ke ra rest plaYl11g each

hard to 10.,1' 1I1terest. Both

phenomenon IS the

Kentucky, arc now III the FL 
and as a result, both teams are 
only 6-5. 

The commercialization of 
the bowl scene is gettmg 
,ridiculous, as well. I remember 
when Mobile Gas sponsored 
the Cotton Bowl back in the 
late '80s and everyone thought 
that was a sellout. ow, online 
companies' names dominate 
bowl titles, as is seen in the 
aforementioned 
Homepoint.com Bowl, not to 
mention the Insight.com Bowl. 
Computer companies now 
sponsor games such as the 
MicronPC Bowl. Even games 
that have retained their old 
names now have corporate 
sponsorship Written all over 
them, which leaves me won-
dering what will happen next 
.. . are these companies going 
to start marketing their prod-
ucts on the field at halftime? 

Another damper on the 
season i this damn Bowl 
Championship Series garbage. 
The BC uses a computer to 
deCide who the best two teams 
111 the country are, with the 
winners facing off against each 
other for the NCAA Division I 

ational ChampIOnship on 
Jan. 4. Since athletic directors 
around the county seem 
adverse to a playoff to decide 
the champion, they have 
decided this is the best way to 
go. Well, I think it sucks' 

Fu rthermore, the best game 
isn't even on New Year 's Day 
anymore. The only games 
being played that day are the 
crappy games I mentIOned 
earlier. Second, the season has 
been organized so that the

Men Split in Utah 
ROAD: Tritons lose once but beat Westminster 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team took a trip to Utah this past 
weekend and came home with a 
split. 

Against Division II 
Utah State on Saturday, 
the Tritons were 
crushed, losing 
82-58. 

On Monday 
against Westminster 
College, UCSD bounced back, 
showing what San Diego is truly 
abou t by dominating the home 
team for 11 77-69 win. 

"It was a good trip," UCSD 
men's basketball Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said . " It was a 
good bonding experience. It was 
a great opportunity." 

The Tritons dominated the game 
against the Westminster Griffins. 

UCSD jumped out to a big first-
half lead, going up 10-0 early. 

The Tritons kept the Griffins in 
line for the entire first half, taking a 
six-point lead at 30-24 in a defen-
sive battle that went into halftime. 

The Griffins regrouped and 
came out strong in the second 

half, catching up with UCSD and 
taking a three-paint advantage. 

UCSO was confident, howev-
er, and returned to first-half form, 
keeping Westminster down by 
eight for much of the second half, 

eventually winning 77-69. 
"We jumped out to a 10-0 
lead and took a six-point 

lead into half-
time," Lanthier 
said. "They took 

a three-point lead in
