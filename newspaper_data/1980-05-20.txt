'TapaDleros' DeDland 
Police Make Changes 

BY JEFF BERESFORD. HOWE 
New. Editor 

A group calling itself the 
"T upameros" phoned the 
Daily Guardian yesterday and 
threatened to take as yet 
unspecified action against the 
campus police if three posted 
demands they have made are 
not met. 

The spokesman, who would 
not identify himself or the size 
or scope of his organization, 
said that his group would take 
action by the end of the quarter 
if their demands are not met, 
or "once the police make 
moves in the opposite 
direction. " 

The T uparneros ' were a 
South American terrorist 
group specializing in 
assassination and political 
extremism. , 

The group that contacted 
UCSD is probably a 
community group, though. 

The demands are : "that the 
campus police practice of 
entering any campus building 
or room without probable 
cause be stopped immedi-

Anti-Prop 9 
Rally Draws 
Crowd 
Ex-Jarvis Aide 
Key Speaker 

BY BARRY MEEPOS 
Staff Writer 

Despite the threatening 
skies, a midday crowd of 
about 150 gathered on 
Revelle rlaza yesterday to 
hear speeches and show their 

' lIupport at a rally for the 
campaign to defeat Proposi-
tion 9. 

The rally was endorsed by 
the ASUCSD, Citizens for 
California, SAAC, Black 
Federation of San Diego, and 
various other groupa opposed 
to the tax-cutting amendment. 

The activities got a late and 
Ies .. than-orB~zed start, as 
moderator Mark Schulze was 
hard.pressed to find the 
student support that. was 
anticipated. ' 

With several TV film aews 
looking on, fint speaker David 
Ernst, Auistant Vice 
Chancellor of Administration 
and chairman of the UCSD 
steering committee on Prop. 9, 
Ilreued the need for getting 
the vote out on Jtme 3, and 
diacuued the fiscal impact of 
Jam. II on the Univerlity of 
California and the inevitability 
of tuition. 

Linda Sabo, former 
commissioner of external 
affain, followed Ernst with an 
explanation of the difference 
between Prop. 9 and Jarvis' 
first tax-cutting proposal, 
Prop. 13. Sabo tried to dispel 
"the myth of Prop. 9 as a 
rational tax plan," which she 
described as "intense, non-
rational and quick-cutting." 

"If it passes, we're not going 
to have visiting professors -
which on this campus are 
some of the best - or 
programs like Frontiers of

Sandinistas Hope 
Direct Democracy 
Can B.uild Base 

BY THOMAS BROM 
P.a& Newa s-;.,. 

BARRIO CIUDAD SANDI NO, NlCARAGUA - The 
)'OUII8 boyl playing a duaty game of "bei.bol" could be 
llinywhere in Latin America. Around them the life of the barrio 
tetdet down for the evenm,. Workerl return home on crowded 
butet, jutt AI the red tun .inkt behind tiny gardena of banana 
.,.am. and plantains. Their makeshift houaet of board and tin 
id'Ilp. are painted the brightest shades of blue, pink and green. 

Thoma Brom, a Pacific New. Seroice editor, recentill 
travelled in Central America. . 
A. darknesl envelops the barrio, pigs are brought in from the 
narrow .treets, and chickens head for the security of a 
backyard coop after a day of scratching in the dirt. 

There are thoUiands of barrio. acro.s Latin America with 
· the .ame look and feel. But this .prawling home. for more than 
35,000 people west of Managua is different. 

Gathering for an evening meeting of the Youth Committee, 
the lame boYI ling a rousing chorus of the Sandinista anthem 
aI-they march joyously down the street. An aging Nicaraguan 
Jndian from Monimbo stops to make a political point - raising 
a callOUIed fist to show what it took to defeat Anastasio 
. Somoza. "Vive Sandino!" he shoull. "Vive d Frente 
Sandinilta!" 

11 the Ciudad Sandino barrio is the heart of Latin America, it 
it alto. the lOui of the NicaraguaR revolution. The poor of the 
. bmiO .:...- marginal, ignorant and sub;ect to the most grisly 
treabnent by the National Guard - were the great fear of the 
43-year Somoza dynasty. The pealanll are now beginning to 
eense their own .trength and power, and Central Americ.a will 
never be the same. 

The nine-member Sandinista Front for National Liberation 
(FSLN) is betting the future of the revolution on a crash 
lJI"OII'am to literally change the consciousness of the poor. The 
program combines official support for popular organizations in 
the barrio with a national literacy cru.ade to raise the levd of 
both political participation and lYorker productivity. 

, At the same time, the Front il trying to discipline the 
'peuants and workers by halting unauthorized land seizures, 

enlorcin~ better work habits, and controlling 8trik~s for higher 
,wages. The result is a mixture of ideali.tic social engineering 
!and pragmatic economics that just might work. . . 
· The problems, however, are immense. Nearly 95 percent of 
the urban population lives a marginal existence, with official 

;unemployment ahove 35 percent. Fully 60 pe4cent of the 
population of 2.3 rnilJion ~ves in extreme povert1, and more 
than half are aliterate. Managua.is still a barren wasteland from 
.the destruction caused by the 1972 earthquake, the major 
' cities lie in rubble from Somoza's bombing during the 
· revolution, and the nation is more than $1.6 billion in debt. 

"Can you imagine," asks Spanish Jesuit Xavier Gorostiaga, 
an economist in the Ministry 'of Planning, "trying to organize a 
new society under such conditions?" 

The FSLN solution is an extraordinary act of faith, an 
-experiment in direct democracy that has captured the 
imagination of the progreSlive elite, v~lage priests and small 
businellmeo even as it frightens them. 

"We are building a participatory democracy, and are far less 
concerned with electoral democracy," says Foreign Minister 
Miguel d'Escoto, a Maryknoll priest trained in the United 
States. "But if you go too slow, the people lose enthusiasm. If 
you go too fast, you can crash." 

Nicaraguan society is now alive with the t~nsion between 
going too slow and the fear of crashing. Conservatives are 
using tile time to organize a political opposition to the 
Sandinistas before barrio organizations produce a literate, 
disciplined bale for the new society . The Sandinistas need 
private capital and expertise until a working class emerges 
ca()able of running the economy. 

The resuh is a footrace for control of the nation taking place 
inJhe barrios and along the dusty roads of the countryside. 
~. v ' Before the FSLN marched into Managua last July, Ciudad 
Sandino was a nondescript barrio known only as OPEN 3 - a 
refugee camp for thousands who fled Managua after the 
earthquake and flooding along Lake Managua in 1972. 

For many years the barrio had no drinkable water, no sewer 
pipes, no electricity, and suffered epidemics of gastroenteritis 
and malaria. "It was a horrible place to live, '~ says Fr. Benigno 
F emandez, a Spanish Jesuit who helped organize one of nearly 
30 Christian communities in the barrio. 

"The landowner finally sold us water by the barrd tl)at he 
should have provided wihout charge," says Mercedes Cerrato, 
a cottonfield worker from Ma.aya who was ·one of the first 
residents of OPEN 3. . 

'Foday, official red and black Sandinista plaques mark ~ch 
zone and section in the barrio, including a large "Ciudad 
Sandino" Iign erected near the highway re-naminA the ' 

Mercede. Cerrato, however, remembers Ciudad Sandino 
before the revolution. "Ignorance was the biggest weapon 
Somoza Uled again.t u.," she says solemnly. "We lived on our 
knees, and many ro.e .to die on their feet. Now we have a 
chance for freedom and dignity. "

Snakes 
Barbaric. 
Editor: 

An issue that was neglected 
by the Progressive Coalition in 
the recent AS Election has 
come to the attention of 
several persons who frequent 
the Muir College Center and 
surrounding area. It concerns 
the dozen rubber snakes nailed 
around the perimeter of the 
Muir Cafeteria as,l suppose, a 
deterrent for nesting birds. 

Given the plethora of happy 
birds now residing under the 
Muir rafters, it would appear 
that the snakes resemble giant 
crucified worms and thus serve 
as a mecca for our feathered 
friends.. The snakes also add 
structural support for the 
ingenious nests now built upon 
them. 

The most amusing result 
will come after the eggs hatch. 
When the chicks see the size of 
the "worms" and then descend 
to capture smaller prey, the 
discrepancy in size between 
their household worms and the 
ones they seek will . instill in 
them incredible self-
confidence. I shun to think 
what may happen to the real 
snakes around here (McElroy, 
Saltman take cover!!). 

The neglected ISsue 
amounts to an objection to thi~ , 
practice. The Grounds and

Mt. St. Helens 
Erupts" .2.9 Missi~g 

VANCOUVER, WA --
The Mount 5t. Helens volcano 
that killed five people, routed 
thousands and left 29 missing 
in a hellish eruption was "still 
perking" yesterday as an 
immense cloud of gray ash 
shrouded cities and towns 
across the West. 

With a plume of steam and 
ash still billowing 14,000 feet 
above the crater, rescue 
helicopters spotted several 
groups of survivors of 
Sunday's fiery cascade of red 
hot mud, gas and ash that 
devastated a 15-m~e swath 
through the mountain 
wilderness. 

A helicopter crew hoisted a 
Castle Rock family of four to 
salety from a point just five 
miles from the base of the 
volcano, but the aircraft was 
forced to leave behind a five-
member paramedic crew in the 
same area. 

In ad'dition, at least two 
other isolated groups were 
spotted from the air in the 
devastated area surrounding 
the volcano. No lava has been 
seen, but scientists were not 
ruling out the possibility of a 
lava flow. 

u It' s still perking. but it is not 
as violent," said Sam Frear, a 
spokesman for the Forest 
Service. "We hope we've seen 
the worst." 

Many communities across 
eastern Washington and· 
Montana were virtually closed

7 inches deep that choked

10th Graders 
Lack Basic Skills 

SACRAMENTO 
Between 30 and 50 percent of 
the 10th.graders in a sampling 
of Califomia's high schools 
have flunked the basic-skills 
tests they ultimatdy must pass 
to graduate, the state 
Department of Education said 
yesterday. 

"Many more students than 
might have been expected" 
are failing at least one portion 
of the reading, writing .and 
mathematics tests and are 
being enrolled in remedial 
classes, the department said . 

It said out of a sample of 
1'55 school districts, half 
reported that 30 percent or 
more of their high school 
sophomores had failed.

BY RC GALlJAN 
It is a fact of life for most 

college students that at. 
sometime during their 
academic career they have 
pulled the last page of a 
voluminous term paper out of 
the typewriter, only to discover 
than they left out a crucial 
paragraph many pages 
before. 

There is a system just 
coming into its prime at UCSD 
that helps remedy this 
problem. Typing, editing and 
proofreading have been 
reduced to simple tasks with 
UCSD's Computer Assisted 
Typing and Typesetting 
system. 

CA IT, <!-S it is called by its 
users, allows a typist to 
compose sentences on any 

interactive campus terminal 
and later make changes 
without having to retype 
everything. 

Two page letters or reports, 
which will not have to be 
revised can usually be done 
more quickly and easily on an 
ordinary typewriter, but 
CA IT is perfect for repetitive 
or lengthy compositions in 
need of changes. 

Line justification, headings, 
footnotes, page numbering, 
and even a search for spelling 
errors are some of the 
automatic features built into 
the system, which can be 
called into use by a few simple 
commands. 

After the document is 
composed on an interactive 
terminal , many of which are 

located around the campusea, 
printouts are made at one of 
the special printers, which 

. have multiple letter type 
capabilities. 

The typesetting features are 
extremely useful in writing a

who can copy Ihe printouts jusl 
as they are.

ichthyologist Dr. Carl L Hubbs collected 
books and reprints of articles on fishes and 
other topics related to his world-renowned 
work in biological sciences. 

His library , numbering more than 
80,000 cataloged items, has been 
donated to the Special CoUections section 
of Scripps Institution of Oceanography's' 
library by Hubbs', wife and library 
coUaborator, Laura C. Hubbs. 

Hubbs, a professor emeritus of biology 
at Scripps, died last June of cancel, but 
oDe of hi, lifdong goals, the special 
handling of his persona/library and its use 
by scientific researchers, will be 
continued. A professor at Scripps since 
1'944, Hubbs embarked on his library 
coUection while at the University of 
Michigan where he was a curator and 
professor from 1920 10 1944. . 

Collecting bQoks and scientific reprints 
was an interest Hubbs began while a 
student at Stanford University in 1915, 
according to Mrs. Hubbs. He started.his 
personal library when he was a student of 
biologist David Starr Jordan who was 
president of Stanford, Mrs. Hubbs 
recalled. 

"Dr. Jordan used to say Carl was one of 
his mOlt promising students," Mrs. Hubbs 
said. "Carl received many reprints from 
Jordan when he had duplicates to 
distribute to students. The collection got 
its beginnings in this small personal way, 
and from there it just evolved and grew 
each year." 

The Hubbs library specializes in fish, 
their classification, distribution, habits, 
and fisheries use, but Hubbs's broader 
interests are also represented. Other 
topics range from archaeol~gy , 

geography, and paleonlology to ecology 
and conservation of animals and plants. 

As the collection grew. Dr. Hubbs 
made it available to his students, 
colleagues, and visitors. Reprints of his 
many scientific articles were mailed to 
hundreds of correspondents and, in 
return, Hubbs received a large number of 
reprints from American and foreign 
sources. 

"It's been a well-known library," Mm. 
Hubbs said. "We have had visitors and 
requests from around the world. It was 
alway, a special pleasure to UI to assist 
researchers by handing out our reprints or 
loaning malerial •. " 

Mrs. Hubbs has worked daily in an 
office near her husband's laboratory, 
where she has attended to library business 
since they came to Scripps in the" 1940..

According to CA TT 
consultants Rick Accurso and 
Mike O'Hagan, the sYltem is 
near .aturation during peak 
periods of the day, but is 
underused at night, when 
students would be best able to 
use the terminals. ' 

Professors and graduate 
students use the system most,

Wenkert, Reknowned Chemist 
Joins UCSD Faculty in F~II 

£mat Wenkert 

Ernest Wenkert, an internationally 
reknowned synthetic organic chemist, has 
joined the UCSD faculty Chemistry Department 
Chaimutn MlDTay Goodman has anl)Ounced, 

Wenkert, 54, is .a native of V,~l\na, AlJStria, 
and was formerly E.D, Butcher Professor of 
ChemNtry at Rice University, where he had 
been chairman of the department since 1976. 

"Dr. Wenkert's speciality is the synthesizing 
of drugs and analogs of medically interesting 
natural products such as hormones and other 
biologically active molecules," Goodman said. 

Wenkert, who wiU bring with him a research 
group of 10 graduate students and po.tdoctoral 
students, will formally appointed to the faculty 
of the UC San Diego Department of Chemistry 
April 1, but will not arrive on campus until the 
fall. 

Wenkert has been a visiting professor at 
various universities throughout the world, and 
tpent a quarter teaching at UCSD in 1976. In 
June 1978, he received an honorary doctorate 
from the Universite de Paris·Sud, 

"We're looking forward to an exciting and 
fruitful association with Professor Wenkert," 
Goodman said. "It is a great honor to wdcome 
him to the UCSD community,"

concern him.elf with all this. At the time his 
wife conceived she was covered by the Blue 
Crou plan, 

What he did not know was that according 
to the Blue Crou contract, they were not 
obliged to pay for the caesarian because it 
occured after the contract had lapsed. 

And under Occidental's contract, they were 
not obliged to pay for the caesarian because 
the child had been conceived before their 
contract took effect. 

Athale was baffled. 
"I am studying to· take my oral. and I don't 

have a lot of time to track these things down. I 
had hoped someone could help me with thi •. " 

But Athale says he could find no one to help 
him, 

"Armitage .ay. he can do nothing; he says 
I should sue the university, but I don't have 
time to bring a law suit. I have 10 study for my 
orals." 

Armitage says he sympathizes with Athale, 
but can do nothing because he is afraid to start 
a "legal precedent" for the university to be 
responsible for the health of .tudents' .pouses. 

Armitage'. ad vice: "He should go and get a 
lawyer, and let the couru decide this one." 

Armitage say. he recognizes that Athale 
might be a apecial case because hi. problem 
resulta from having been caught by the 

change In insurance companies, but Armitage 
says his hands are still tied. 

"The committee (reg f~) voted not to cover 
pregnan.cies of spouses , I . wouldn't want to 
contradict that," Armitage said, 

Athale responds, "I am a student, I don't 
have time to sue the university. Armitage is 
vice chancellor of student affairs, I thought it 
waA his. job to work out things like this. Why 
doesn't he do something?" 

Athale met last Monday with Armitage; 
Dr. Robert Allen, the head of the Student 
Health Center: Karen Rosenberg, the Student 
Health Services Intern; and campus attorney 
Nick Aguilar, to try and clear up the matter. 

What came out of the meeting, AthaJe 
says, is that he was advised to seek 
compensation again from Bloe Crou, if that 
does not provide results, .ue the university, 

Athale says he does not expect Blue Cro.s 
to honor his new claim, as he has already been 
rejected by them once, If they do reject his 
claim, he saya he' wiD probably take 
Armitage's advice and file suit against the 
univerlity . 

Baffled and perhaps a little bitter, Athale 
says, "Theae people are suppOsed to help 
students, but all they .:ay is 'aue, .ue, .ue.'"
