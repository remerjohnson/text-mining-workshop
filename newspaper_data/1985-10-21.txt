La Jolla's Gold Rush: 
who will get 

By MICHAEL AHN 
As far as Bob tarkey is concerned , the year 1990 

IS about 12 months away. Starkey, an analytical 
studies officer for UC D Planning, acts as a sort of 
gatherer of vital numbers for the university. The 
numbers that Starkey compiles, to a large degree 
dictate growth for the campus, and what he has 
found is that this year, UCSD has almost enough 
students to meet the original growth projection for 
the year 1990. 

there first? 
Approximately 12,850 undergraduates are 

attending school here this year. The number 
projected for undergraduates on campus five years 
from now was 13,500. According to Starkey, we 
should cros that threshold next year. 

"This is slower than we have grown ," said 
tarkey. "We grew about 35 percent in the last five 

years." 
However, Starkey says that the number of new 

students at UC D is growing "geometrically" and 
that "we don't want to grow as fast as we have. We 
think we have stret hed the limits of classrooms,

down." 

All those people commg to UCSD will fill the 
dorms and housing around the campus. Provisions 
are being made on campus; UCSD's Long Range 
Development Plan (LRDP), an outline for the growth 
of the campus, has included provisions for on-
campus housing of 45 percent to 50 percent of total 
student enrollment. That's an increase from earlier 
plans which had 30 percent of total student 
enrollment housed on campus. 

The LRDP also includes provisions for 
development in the area surrounding UCSD which 
would affect off-campus housing in the vicinity of 
the university. The plan admits that in the past 
there existed a "negative attitude on the part of 
many students toward living on campus;" but that

Dr, Doolitde receives 
honor 

UC5D chemistry professor Dr. 
Russell Doolittle and mathemati s 
professor Dr. Michael Freedman 
have been elected to the 
American Academy of Arts and 
ScIences, considered one of the 
highest honors a faculty member 
can attain. 

The latest election brings to 
196 the number of UC faculty 
who are members of the 
prestigious Cambridge, 
Massachusetts based 
organization. They were among 
85 selected nationwide at the 
Academy's 208th annual meeting 
held in May. 

The Academy is a national 
honor socle!)' With an active 
membership of approximately 
2,400 scholars, artists and public 
figures. It was founded in 1780 
by John Adams and other leaders 
of the American revolution 

In all, there were 13 new 
members elected from the UC 
system thIS }'car 

Kimonos displayed 
at Grove Gallery 
Artists jay Whaley and Carolyn 
Clark Bush will show jewelry, 
wood sculpture and hand-
paInted SIlk kimonos in a joint 
show they call 
"Illusions/AllusIons," at the 
University of California, San 
Diego UC Crafts Center/ Grove 
Gallery, from Oct. 21-Nov. 2. 

With her painted silks and 
kimonos, San Diego anist 
Carolyn Clark Bush says she 
continually explores the 
relationship between object and 
pattern, fonn and function . 

"The patterns in my current 
work allude to the objective 
image of fish; the form of the 
kimono alludes to the function of 
ceremonial clothing," Bush said . 

Whaley's jewelry and sculpture 
is understated and 

con~emporary . "My jewelry is 
meant to be worn by men and 
women alike. I resist the 
influences of bizarre fonns and 
exotic materials, preferring to 
create fonns with a more 
enduring and intrinsically 
valuable quality," he said , 

The works of Bush and 
Whaley are well known in the

Kns[ln Luker, asso late 
professor of sociology, was 
named a winner of the Charles 
Honon Cooley Award for her 
book, Abortion and rhe PolitiC' of 
Motherhood. Luker receIved her 
award from the Society for 
Symbohc Interactlon based in 
Washmgton , D.C. 

Her book, which was also 
nominated for a Pulitzer PrIze, 
examines the abortion 
controversy and why it has 
become such an emotionally and 
socially Important issue . 

Both Madsen's and Luker's 
books were published by the 
UniverSIty of California Press. 

Department chainnan Andrew 
Scull noted that the UCSD 
sociology depanment has been 
"extraordinarily productive" in 
publishing books during the past 
couple of years. 

"Last fall we organized a book 
fair for books published by our 
faculty over the preceding twO 
years and there were more than 
20 books on display, an 
exceptional record of 
productivity for a faculty of 21 ,"

UC President speaks out on Pacific Rim 
B RACHEL FREIFELDER. cnlm wff WncCl 

U NlVERSITlE~ AND colleges should IInprove theIr effectiveness in 
preparing Pacific Rim nations , 
University of California President 
David Gardner tOld a group of 
legislators from about 30 states at 
conference this week. 

The conference, held at UC 
Berkeley and co-sponsored by 
the State Legislative Leaders' 
Foundation of Boston , Mass ., 
brought tOgether a large group of 
state legislatOrs to dISCUSS the 
growing International importance 
of countries bordenng the Pacifi c 
Ocean . 

AccordIng to systemwide news 
sources, the purpose was to 
better inform these legislators, 
The American educatIOnal system 
was not a central topic . Gardner 
hosted the conference but did 
not actually participate. A 
spokesperson said. however. that 
Gard ner "has made it one of his 
prioritIes to address the issues of 
PaCIfIc relations" and IS 
espeCIally concerned WIth Japan 
and lann America. 

"We are wItnessIng a major 
shIft of power and influence 
toward the countnes of the 
PaCific RIm, and so far, at If'ast, 
there IS little e\~dence that we, 
are ready to deal WIth the 
implications of that shift," 
Gardner said to conference 
participants. 

Medical researcher 
named Pew Scholar 

Dr. Douglass j. Forbes, an 
assistant professor of biology at 
the University of California , San 
Diego, has been named a Pew 
Scholar in the biomedIcal 
sciences by the Pew Memorial 
Trust, Philadelphia. 

As one of 20 young medical 
resea rc hers th roughout the 
country to be selected for the 
program, she will receive a tOtal 
of $200,000 in $50,000 annual 
installments during the next four 
years. The awards are the first to 
be made by the newly fonned 
scholars program. 

Forbes, who last year 
completed an American Cancer 
Society se nior postdoctoral 
fellowship at UCSF, is 
co nducting basic research in cell 
biology. She is investigating cell 
functions using synthetic nuclei , 
with a focus on gene expression 
and protein transpon in and out 
of nuclei. 

The Regents proposed budget 
for 1986-87 includes an 
additional $1 million for research 
on the Pacific Basin, as well as 
funds to establish a Graduate 
School of Intemational Relations 
and Pacific Studies, the first of 
its kind in the nation. They also 
hope to expand the Education 
Abroad Program from 125 to 525 
students. Gardner has no 
concrete suggestions for changes 
in the UC curriculum. 

Experts on a wide variety of 
fields prese nted their knowledge 
for the legIslators' benefit. 

UC faculty attendrng included 
two from UC5D: Melvin NA 
Peterson, project director of the 
Deep Sea Drilling Project and 
Donald L. Wyman, public affairs 
director fo the U.s.-Mexico 
Studies Center. 

When asked about the 
relevance of hIS involvement, 
Pete rson explained that the 
conference was not limited to 
issues of international politiCS, 
but addressed all facets of 
human actlvlt\es rnvolving the 
Pacific Basin. He said he spoke 
on the resource potentials of the 
ocean and procesS(s for re our e 
recove ry. 

With respect to Gard ner's 
statements, Peterson said he 
would " .. , agree very much 
(that) it IS important to be 
internationally informed, 
responsive and sensitive." He 
describes his own project as 
"probably the world 's finest 
example of international 
cooperation .... Unlike many 
who go international just to get 
funding" ,. (we are a) truly 
cooperative scientific venture. 
(We gOt) $1 million from each of 
five non-U.S. countries (and 
share) advice and results. It's 
certainly productive to operate in 
the international mode." 

Like Gardner, Peterson sees no 
imediate need for changes in 
academic curricula . 

Wyman, who spoke at the 
conference on newly 
industrializing nations and 
especiany the debt crisis in Latin 
America , had more to say "about 

Remember: 

educanon in America. He fecls 
that our educational system does 
not do enough to prepare 
student for ever-increasing 
international involvements. Dr. 
Wyman is particularly concerned 
about the lack of foreign 
language and particularly non-
Western languages in most 
students' programs. EspeCially 
important is training at the 
precollegiate level in languages 
and cross-cultu ral studies. 
Wyman said he would espeCIa lly 
like to see the Japanese StudIes 
Program strengthened at UCSD. 
More courses on Japan should be 
offered , along with courses in 
international business. e.g. 
multinational o rporations and 
developing nations. 

On the topic of an Ethnic 
rudies department, Wyman is 

less positive. "I would have to 
know exactly what it was. 
Departments tend to be 
orgamzed around diSciplines: I 
think that's a good idea." 

Both Wyman and Peterson 
support enthUSIastically the 
proposed Graduate chool of 
International Relauons . 

The conference may be 
sigmficant for the UC system In 
tenns of setting precedents, 
Wyman noted that the State 
Legislative Leaders' Foundation 
ordinarily meets in 
Massachussetts and restricts its 
topi CS to management issues. 
This is the first time such a large 
group of legislators has met to 
discuss a global issup • and 
Wyman feels that the choice of 
California as the location was 
not purely happenstance. "The 
State is being recognized as an-
important base for such events, 
and the University of California 
is similarly being recognized as 
an intellectual center. 

The Gardner administration 
hopes this will be the first of 
several conferences. Office 
representatives said they are 
building a program called 
Emerging Issues, a series of 
annual symposia to be held on 
UC campuses. ~

that people should not have a

People should keep aware of

What would they say? 

'r alking to the ani1l1als 
By NIKI NEWlANDS, Staff Writer 

I NA LECTURE on interspecies communication last Wed nesday evening at 
UCSD, joanne Tanner, 
representing Dr. Francine 
Patterson and the Gorilla 
Foundation , made the suggestion 
that humans and apes ought to 
be placed in the same genus, 
due to a number of startling 
similari ties between them: 
including the ability to acquire 
language. 

The similarity in chromosomal 
makeup of chimpanzees and 
humans and of gorillas and 
humans is approximately 97 
percent, Tanner said . 
Morphologically, the structures of 
the gorifia and chimpanzee are 
basically identical to human 
structure , with the exception of 
the proportional length of the 
apes' limbs. Both chimpanzees 
and gorillas have the same kinds 
of muscles as humans, and the 
same organ placement. 

The lecture was presented in 
Mandeville Auditorium by UCSD 
Extension, in conjunction with 
Muir College, the San Diego 
Zoological Society, and Ralphs 
Groceries Corporation. Entitled , 
'If A~s Could Talk, What Would 
They say?: the symposium 
covered two current research 
projects on primate linguistics: 
Dr. Francine Patterson's work 
with two gorillas, Koko and 
Michael , and Dr. Roger Fouts' 

research with the chimp, 
Washoe. 

Don Lindberg, a primate 
researcher at the San Diego Zoo, 
nOted that when studies in 
primate linguistics began, 
researchers soon found that apes 
are incapable of producing 
phonetics like humans because 
of a fundamental difference in 
their vocal tracts, 

Beatrice and Allen Gardner, 
twO prominent chimpanzee 
researchers . by-passed this 
limitation by approaching 
interspecies communication 
through the use of sign language.

Rescue Money 
Editor: 

In the October 7 issue of the 
Guardian , Joe Wainio raised the 
issue of "Ignoring the Third 
World" and suggested that the 
Reagan administration's plans to 
spend $24 billion on Star Wars 
could be better spent if given to 
the Third World as a solul1on for 
poverry and hunger. 

To help find a method to help 
the Third World , perhaps a 
"Third World Success Story" - a 
country that rose from 
insignificance to a world power 
- could offer some guidance in 
creaung a nation l1l which "the 
issue for at least 90 percent of 
the population is not survIval, 
but rather which luxuries must 
be foregone ." 

The United States began the 
same way as did many of today's 
Third World countries, with 
independence from the British 
Empire. Before independence, 
settling the New World meant a 
struggle to survive . One of the 
mOSt famous groups of setders, 
the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, 
had to deal with the problem of 
allocating scarce resources. The 
first year, as recounted by 
Governor Bradford in his diary, 
everything was distributed "from 
each according to his ability, to 
each according to his needs" -
a true egalitarian system wherein 
all crops were stored in a 
community warehouse and 
drawn from by each family as 
needed . 

During the first winter, 
Governor Bradford noticed a 
problem wah this system. The 
Pilgnms were starving. The 
followmg year he Issued a new 
plan - each famll}' would only 
get what they produced 
themselves Lo and behold , when 
helor£' only Dad had heen 
workIng the fIelds, now ~Iom 
and the kid~ were out there, 100. 
everyone had a stake in the 
production of food and were 
rewarded for theIr own results. 
Food became plentiful. This 
syste m of self-reliance became 
indicative of the people that 
would build the United States. 

Many years later, the U.S. 
Constitution became the formula 
for success: The guarantee of 
personal liberry and the 
ownership of private propeny; 
democratic government with a 
free-emerprise economic system. 
This is what turned a Oedgling 
country into a superpower - a 
system so efficient that a mere 3 
percent of the U.S. population 
feeds not only the United States, 
but a hundred million people in 

the rest of me world . 
I realize that this IS a drasti 

oversimplificanon of the U .. 
history and that today's Third 
World is different than the ew 
World, but the point is still valid 
- personal freedom and 
properry rights e ncourage the 
hard work and creativity that 
provide us with the standard of 
living that leads us to worry 
about luxuries and not 
necessities, the reason the 
Uni ted States has trouble 
keeping people out and the 
Soviets must build a wall to keep 
people in. 

While it's trut' that a continent 
full of natural resources helped 
the growth of th.e United States, 
other countries have similar 
success without them. Japan 
today is surely an economic 
superpower. A nation poor in 
resources and an industrial base 
vinually destroyed by WWII , 
Japan built a new economy 
modeled directly on the United 
States. In four decades Japan has 
grown to rival the United States 
in technology and exports, West 
Germany has also experienced 
similar success. Comp;!re this to 
the dismal performance of 
socialist East Gennany, modeled 
after the same economic disaster 
that most Third World countries 
emulate - the Soviet Union. 

Russia was once known as the 
"Breadbasket of Europe ," but 

Ethiopians are stili starving 
because of the actions of their 
governmenl. While people 
starved, donated food was 
stacked on docks because the 
Ethiopian government chose to 
use its trucks to relocate people 
for political reasons rather than 
for distributing food . Several 
cases have been reponed where 
the government forced thousands 
away from Western aid center or 
had MIGs strafe aid convoys to 
war tom areas, The cycle of 
starvation is guaranteed because 
the Ethiopian government 
pursues Marxist goals rather than 
humanitarian goals. There has 
been recent drought relief from 
seasonal rains, but 90 percent of 
the farmlands went unplanted , 
mostly because of the 
government's relocation 
programs. 

Unfonunately, Ethiopia is just 
one of many cases where a Third 
World government has foiled 
\) .S. aid effons. Some years ago, 
shortly after gaining its 
independence, Bangladesh 
suffered a severe famine 
(remember the Concen for 
Bangladesh?) and the Western 
world came to the rescue. 

Experience has shown that 
ever-increasing aid is nOl a long 
term solution to world hunger. 
What is required is help for the 
Third World to develop a 
working free-emerprise system 

I would like ID give my wanne!lt m.nIcs to aD the 
studentS staff and facuky who have been 50 kind and supportJ~ throughout my stay here, for helping me be a 
pan of their lives and the UCSD campus. I wam to 
especially thank the Revelle Sundry SlDre, APSA, the AS, 
the Guardian and all the Other student organizations who 
have made everything posslble. Thank you, everybody' 

followmg the revolullon they've 
expenenced 70 years of bad 
harvests. Under communism 
they must Impon gram from the 
United States. Such an obvious 
failure would seem to be a poor 
role model , yet Marxism runs 
rampant throughout the Third 
World, 

Although Mr. Wainio's anlCle 
implies differentiy, the United 
States is the world's most 
generous nation , it gives away 
more non-military aid than the 
rest of the world combined. 
Unfonunately, in the hands of 
Marxist governmentS this aid 
does little good . 

Despite biUions in aid, 

With all my love,

that can provtde economtc and 
technologIcal growth. The United 
States can 't solve the problem by 
merely throwing money at il. 
Only by spreading the 
philosophy of freedom and by 
curbing Marxism can the Third 
World be brought up to the 
standard of living enjoyed by the 
United States.

Concerning an anicle in the

Gus Santayo. 
Mr. Santayo: 

With all due respect , may I 
assume you are not a fan of the 
American League West? Or, 
could you possibly be from L.A? 
Maybe neither. But something 
has to be set stratighl. 

Please be aware that the 
Kansas City Royals have a very 
large and consistent follOwing. 
They have made it 10 the 
playoffs every year since 1977 
with the exception of one 
season. How many teams match 
this? 

Funher, they now have the 
opponunity and chance to 
clinch the World Series, But 
Instead of nOling such 
outstanding statistics, you have 
elected to discuss how the 
Midwest is a poor market for 
sports ratings. Let me tell you, 
spons promOlion is one of the 
hottest industries in the Midwest 
at the present. Moreover, I 
Sincerely doubt that any nerwork 
would be carrying a Series if they 
thought they would do so poorly 
as to break even. 

So please .... lighten up. 
Give two superior basebaH tearns 
a fair shake. Enjoy the Series for 
what it is . . . SPORT . , . not a 
prospective monopoly for a 
network. That's not the players' 
concern at this pOint. Why 
should it be yours? 

I wiD grant you that the 
Cardinals have speed ... and 
turf may help. But it may very 
well help the Royals 100. Who 
knows? 

George Brett is one of the best 
players in baseball , regardless of 
leagues. He is not trying to be 
any "Mr. OctOber." He is doing 
what he chooses to do with his 
life . And fonunately for him , he 
IS very good at It. He is by no 
means the only reason why the 
Royals are gOing 10 the World

in basehall who have put days,

known as Baseball. 

Who are you to be such a 
judgmental critic? Maybe you

I personally live with these •

Already Liberated 
Editor: 

The September 23 issue of The 
Guardian ran a commentary 
written by Patti Orozco entitled 
"Women Stunted Under 
Patriarchy." I am impelled to 
reply in kind. Ms. Orozco 
evidently is an angry and upset 
woman who will relax only when 
at least 50 percent of the male 
members of our legislatures are 
ran bodily out of town and 
tarred and feathered by a wild 
group of liberated, hard-working 
and well-paid assemblywomen 
along the way. After disposing of 
the dirty patriarchs, the 
enlightened women will 
stampede in formation to Capitol 
Hill and rewrite all those laws 
that have been suppressing the 
desires and ambitions of "real" 
women all these years . 

In her anger, Ms. Orozco has 
confused contemporary American 
social patterns with legislative 
action. The American woman has 
had to work hard and long to 
gain a foothold in a male-
dominated workplace, and her 
effons have been very wonhy of 
praise from men and women. 
And I would like to add, those 
effons have also been fairly well 
documented. But Ms. Orozco is 
unaware of any progress by 
women in the last two decades 
- she rants and raves about the 
poor subjugated woman who has 
had to suffer the binding 
restraints of femininity in a 
society of capitalistic and greedy 
men. And in her opening 
statement, she lays a big pan of 

' the blame on men "in patriarch .. l 
robes that reign over an 
oppressed maJority .... " She 
evidently sees Congress as a vast 
hall of granite-chinned, cruel 
men who meet in smoky rooms, 
plOlung how to krep those lowly 
women In theIr place. She even 
accuses our evil male legislatures 
of "uphold i ng" these ternblc 
laws. A review of the basic 
framework of our federal 
government and its branches 
would be in order, Ms'-Orozco. 

And while espousing nothing 
less than a sociol cultural/legal 
revolution, Ms. Orozco yet 
diminishes the capabilities of an 
18-year old "daughter of a 
successful businessman" because 
she "believes she can accomplish 
anything," evidently a naive and 
uninformed bdief. Would Ms. 
Orozco be happier if this 
deprived young "freshperson" 

. was as angry and stunted as she 
is? 

I do nO( mean to imply that

Terrorism Uncovered: IV 

Into the minds of the actors 
By.DA YID RICHARD 

What compels the terrorist? A 
popular misperception remains 
that terrorists are uncontrollable 
psychopaths, devoid of 
compassion. In fact , the terrorist 
may feel a deep and pressing 
motivation , one that justifies 
violence in the name of 
morality or idealism. Killing is 
consciously perceived , and 
popularly espoused, as a reaction 
to an unjust system , never as an 
end in itself. In this way the 
terrorist is able to compete with 
the nation-state for popular 
approval. 

l he terrorisr often has 
panicularly strong political 
beliefs. These beliefs may be 
expresed through active 
nationalism, anarchism , Marxism; 
in sum, a whole range of 
ideologies. But one point is clear 
- regardless of its panicular 
manifestation , the ideology is 
useful for the terrorist in that it 
provides a context for violence. 
The PLO justifies the murder of 
Israelis in the name of a 
Palestinian homeland. The 
Provisional IRA bombs British 
establishments in the name of a 
free Ireland . The Armenian 
terrorists, both the right-wing 
JCAG and the Marxist ASALA, 
assassinate Turkish diplomats to 
avenge the murder of one mllion 
Annenians in the I 890s. Same 
action, different context. 

Whether violence is justified is 
beyond the scope of this anicle; 
what is of concern is the specific 

uc 
CHHmHfH 

motivation underlying the 
terrorist action . It is this 
motivation that provides the 
basis of support for the terrorist. 
Without it , terrorism achieves 
Ii ttie success in alte ri ng the 
course of hiStory. 

Justifications of Violence 
The effectiveness of terrorism 

can be judged primarily in Ihe 
context of it appeal to a target 
population . If the group receives 
broad popular sup on, its 
motivation for action (e.g. -
reacti on to the nati on -state, 
Ideology, etc.) could be 
considered of popular appeal. 
Nationalists who utilize the 
tactics of terrorism , such as the 
Tupamaros in Uruguay, are 
extremely effective primarily 
because they have the sympathy 
of the public. When the anacked 
government is perceived as 
unjust, panicularly by its own 
population , the terrorist becomes 
Robin Hood incarnate . 

However, most terrorists do 
not have a burning sense of 
nationalism. The above 
observation does nOl explain the 
existence of the Baader-Meinhof 
gang, the British Angry Brigade , 
or the Japanese Red Army 
Faction. Indeed, even the 
Provisional IRA no longer 
receives much suppon from the 
Catholic community it is 
committed to liberate. This is 
because the Provisional IRA has 
no panicular political theory 
other than amish-mash Qf 

revolutionary dogma along the 
lines of Carlos Marighela, the 
famous Latin who advocated 
provoking repression from the 
nation-state in the hopes of 
catalyzing a popular revolution. 
But, contrary to Marighela's 
vision , these groups have failed 
to "catalyze" the revolution. In 
fact, little has been accomplished 
other that the killing of many 
innocent people. 

A Psychological Explanation 
So why do the terrorists 

persist? Why does the PLO 
continue to kIll Israelis when 
sllch killing achieves no political 
success and results only in Israeli 
retaliation? Terrorism without 
support (I.e . - a justification 
accepted by the public) has yet 
to overthrow any government , 
The Italian Red Brigades 
continue to kill , continue to 
terrorize and continue to fail in 
their pursuit of revolution. How 
does one explain human 
behavior which persists despite 
indisputable evidence that it has 
failed in its chief objective? Are 
we left only with the power of 
dogma, the power of ideology to 
explain behavior? That in itself is 
nor an answer; indeed, it 
circumvents the question 
altogether. For if a terorist 
recognizes the failure of his 
action to catalyze the masses, he 
must by extension recognize the 
failure of his ideology to explain 
what type of action can be 
accurately considered a catalyst. 

OlfGO 

In sum , simply pOinting at 
ideology is a hollow answer. 

Terrorism thrives , depite its 
political failure , simply because it 
provides the terrorist with some 
very imponant reinforcements. 
First of all , violence is the tool of 
the polistaraxic, the upsetter of 
the community. From violence, 
the terrorist experiences a 
reafriTlJ1ation of his self-esteem. 
As a member of a group , 
particularly one which operates 
under such intense pressure, the 
terrorist experiences 
depersonalization (in the form of 
submimng mdivlduality for th e 
cause) as well as deceptively 
powerful feelings of control over 
society. The terroris t acquires a 
belief in the magic of violence 
since violence tends to actualize 
one's ideology. It no longer is 
theory; it is now life. The 
terrorist is committed to a course 
of action. For the ideologue , it is 
the natural synthesiS of idealism 
with reality. 

Thus, terrorism continues. it 
continues nOl because its 
political goals are obtai ned 
(i ndeed , they rarely are) but 
because the act of terrorism itself 
provides some very powerful 
incentives for repetition. In 
Western societies, the danger of 
terrorism is not so much the 
potential for revolution, but the 
backlash of the government. 
Prime Minister Irudeau of 
Canada did nOt hesitate to send 
the anned forces into the streets

OPINIONS 

in 1975 when the FlQ 
kidnapped two Canadian 
olTicials. Instead of catalyzing a 
revolution, the FLQ only 
succeeded in provoking the 
temporary suspension of basic 
rights Canadians have so long 
treasured. Has the FLQ achieved 
any greater credibility? Not in 
the least. 

The true threat to the 
terrorist's livelihood comes not 
from the government it attacks , 
but from the target population it 
contends to Impress. If the 
terrorist is negatively perceived 
by the target population he seeks 
to "catalyze," society will naturally 
accept measures which punish 
the terrorist for his actions. 
Image is everything. If the public 
accepts as just the motivation for 
action, the likelihood of the 
public accepting harsh 
countermeasures by a 
government are remote . Such was 
the case in Uruguay. 

Terrorism is a self-fulfilling 
action. It does not necessarily 
need the realization of ultimate 
goals to encourage its occurence. 
The act itself encourages 
repetition. When terrorism 
achieves popular support, when 
its goals are seen as legitimate , 
then the potential for revolution 
is real. When it does not achieve 
suppon, it continues simply 
because it has become an end in 
itself. A political psychotherapy 
of sons, it has withstood the 
measure of time.

Now, v.~th the aid of American 
Sign Language (ASL) and 
computer symbols, 20 years of 
research has been dedicated to 
improving the communication 
gap. Lindberg said. 

Tanner said one doesn't have 
to have a degree in primatology 
to work with apes. She is a 
profeSSional violinist who was 
inspired by an anicle on Koko in 
National Geographic Magazine. 
EventuaUy marriage brought her 
from New York to California 
where she contacted Patterson. 
To work with Michael and Koko, 
one must show ASL and be able 
to devote a year's work to the 
[wo gorillas. A turnover period 
under a year is disturbing to the 
gorillas. Tanner said. 

Tanner first thought that she 
would like to use music therapy 
with Koko, but those plans were 
soon thwaned when Tanner 
learned that Koko puts a blanket 
over her head when she hears 
music. Michael, on the other 
hand, enjoys music. Often. when 
his therapist visits him, Koko 
will knock on the waU separating 
their trailers and sign "QUIET 
THERE." 

eventuaUy earned him his 
degree . 

The Gardners raised Washoe 
as if she were a deaf human 
child. There was no drilling of 
signs - they were merely 
acquired through use. Project 
Washoe ended in 1970. and 
Fouts took over the research 
with Washoe. He expanded the 
group of chimps and studied 
their "conceptual use of signs" 
and "specific versus generic use." 
The main question addressed 

was whether or not Washoe 's 
language could be transferred 
ac ross generations. 

After her own mfant died , 
Washoe ado pted a IO-month-old 
male. The Gardners had since 
leamed that chimps can acquire 
signs in their founh month . so 
Washoe's new infant was already 
ht'hind . 

Fouts explained the course his 
research took. and showed slides 
and three videos of Washoe's 
group in teracting with sign 
language. 

Patterson , a Stanford graduate , 
had been studying monkeys at 
the San Francisco Zoo in the 
early 70s when she heard about 
a baby gorilla that was born on 

the Founh of July, 1971. The 
b'lby Koko had to be removed 
from her mother because Koko 
(the baby) was malnounshed. 

Koko learned to sign first by 
moldmg (trainers would mold 
her hands mto signs) and then 
by imitation. The gorilla 
Foundation has termed the 
language that Koko and Mike 
use, "Gorilla Sign Language 
(GSL)." The gorillas are limited in 
their ability to exactly duplic te 
some ASL signs due to the size 
and dexterity of their hands and 
arms. 

ASL is probably the most 
misunderstood language in the 
COUntry. Many people assume 
that ASL is merely a manual

translanon of spoken English. It 
has also been mistaken as a 
umversal form of pantomime or 
a telegra phic. icomc code lacking 
Its own grammancal rules. 

A Single English word can 
seldom express the complete 
meaning of a single sign because 
of a feature called modulation: 
any change in one of the signs' 
four basic units (hand shape, 
orientation. movement and 
location) may alter its meaning. 
Also. facial and body movement 
are used to convey semantic and 
syntactiC information in ASL. 

Koko has a vocabulary of 
about 500 signs. Recently she 
has asked her trainers to spell 
words for her. It was first noticed 
that she recognizes individual 
letters when she repeatedly 
pointed to the word "carrot" and 
signed "red , red ." Trainers finally 
caught on when they saw she 
was pointing to one of the "r's" 
in ucarrot. 1I 

Because it is difficult for 
Koko's thick fingers to sign 
letters, Tanner invented an 
alphabet using words. Koko now 
signs t~e al~~abet "apple , bean, 
cat, dnnk ... 

There are 20 words that she 
can read, and 12 letters that she 
recognizes. She loves to spell , but 
like a child she sometimes does 
not focus on the whole word. 
Many words are confUSing to 
her. How do you explain to a 
goriUa that "kn" and "n" make 
the same sound? 

Koko can also count by 
rapping her knuckle Oll a 
surface. 

Fouts' background is much 
different. He joined the Gardners 
in their third year of training the 
chimp they had cross-fostered. 
(Cross-fostering means one 
species raising another). The 
years Fouts spent training 
Washoe were care fully recorded 
for his dissenation. and 

Dr. Francine Peterson c omm un icates with Kollo/he Gorilla using a vocabulary oJ500sign5. 

Both the Gorilla Foundation 
and Project Washoe are non-
profit organizations and welcome 
donations. [ij

not specify what type of housing

in a somewhat defensive posture 
regarding develpment in the

space diminishing, the univesity 
finds that "Instead of being a 
drivlOg force behind the 
development of its adjacent 
communI!)', the campus now 
finds Itsclf reacting to It. " 

What it finds itself rca ting to 
I office space - lots of it. For 
the area easl of UC D known as 
the Golden Tnangle , office space 
IS the gold that makes thiS area 
the mother lode for developers. 

As this development near 
campus grows. studenIs arc 
coming to UC D In droves.

many communItIes to choose 
from : north to Del Mar and 
Solana Beach, soU[h to PaCIfic 
and MIssion Beach , and east to 
Universiy City and Mira Mesa 
HOUSing seems to eXist 
everywhere except where It 
would seem most logical and 
convenIent, that IS, in the 
VIcinIty neXI to the campus. 

When the LRDP was drafted 
in 1963, the planners had no 

real idea of what would happen 
to the land surrounding the 
am pus. In a way the remoteness 

of the campus was an incredible 
boon to the university norhing 
bur virgin, rabblt·populated mesa 
surrounding it with seemingly 
unlimited growth possibilities on 
the horizon. 

Twenty-two years later, thm 
honzon i quickly approaching. 
Back in 1963 the LRDP co uldn 't 

describe the Incredible growth 
occuring In the Golden Triangle . 

tudems can expect very little 
in' the way of housing and 
services (supennarkets, . 
drugstores , resraurants, etc .) from 
the Golden Tnangle . UCSD 
Campus Planner Pat Collum said 
that since the land near UCSD is 
privately owned, the campus has 
had to lobby developers Into 
building housing instead of more 

was to be built : 
"One condition was that the 

city would prepare a master plan. 
The City did indeed do that . It's 
just that the plan didn't say thaI 
they had to build in a certain 
price range." 

The developers of the triangle 
are strivi ng for office space and 
high-median, high -pnced 
condos or retirement omplexcs. 
They believe the land IS s imply 
too valuable to waste on middle-
income hOUSing for stUdents. 
There are rich senior citizens 
read)' to pay large sums to live in 
such exclusive developments as 
La Jolla Colony, and there arc big 
and small businesses ready to 
jump at the han e of occupying 
space in Regents Park. 

Regents Park is the most 
distincth'e of the Golden 
Triangle developments. Sitting 
across from the Mesa Apartments

Bob tarhy, UCSD Ana()'tlwl tUillC, OffiCCt , say, wltli the expanding commercial space . But the 
'Golden Tnanglc the University and students Will be lP1 an awkward SituatIOn . developers of Regents Park are 

asking the Ctty to cut the original 

have possibl)' forecasted the 
explOSIve growth of an Diego, 
or the enormous profits those 
mesas east of the campus meant 
to whomever owned them . 

The ongmal plan had a Vision 
of a "university- oriented 
communi!)'· Instead of the 
Golden Triangle. The reVlsed 
LRDP sees the "university 
community" concept "eroding," 
an ironic choice of words to 

profitable office space o n a 
Golden Tnangle development 
like Regents Park. 

Since the Golden Triangle is 
prIvately owned , the university 
has no legal control over 
development . However, said 
Collum "Lobbying helps to some 
extent. HOUSIng is there because 
of the pressure the university 
puts on the developer." 

UCSD also receives help for 

proposed 550 housing units 
(with more than half of the units 
to be concentrated in three high. 
rise towers ) by 300 units The 
300 UnitS would become office 
space , increasing the commercial 
space at Regents Park to about 
one million square feet. 

Jeff Parks, president of the 
Lomas Santa Fe Group, 
developers of Regents Park, said 
that the cut is being asked for 
·because of lack of need for high.

"There is no marker fo r high . 

rise housing in San Diego . There 
is also a lack of marketability for 
high·-rise living in San Diego." 

A supennarket and drugstore 
in the original plan s have also 
been eliminated so that the 
50,000 square feet can be 
substituted with what Parks 
called "boutique space for 
speCialized use" along the lInes 
o f "flower s hops, tobacco shops 
and small markets." A 360·room 
Marriott hotel is also bei ng buIlt 
in Regents Park. According to 
Parks , retai l space for a Vons 
market or Longs drug store 'Just 
didn't make muc h sense." 

According to Parks, the 
Golden Triangle will Invite

WIll In tum benefit the university . 
"We live in an Diego. 1 ee Ihat 
the types of things gOing on 
around UC D would

that we're overbuildIng in terms 
of offi e building. But that's the 
way the pattern goes. 

"The area was originally 
planned as an urban corridor by 
the ci ty. But name any major 
campus in the United tates and 
you're gOIng to hnd bUSIness

"UC D is going to attraci

You need industry as well as

question is what is that ba1ance."

As a former chairperson of the 
University City Planning Group, 
an advisory group made up of

Johnnie has worked for UCSD 
as a custodian for the past 17 
years. As he puts 1[, 'Tm not a

What motivates him to arrive 
each day on campus at 5 am , 
ready to scrub bathrooms, 
vacuum floors and extenSively 
clean two·Slary buildlOgs? "I'm 
allergic to starvatlon ," says 
johnnie maner-or. facdy. "The WIll 
to survive ," he adds with a 
twinkle In hiS eye 

johnnie, who' was born in 
Texas, moved from the San 
FranCISCO Bay Area to southern 
CalIfornIa , afte r he broke off his 
lengthy affair WIth the U . Army 
Afrer mOVIng to La j olla , he 
worked at ScrIppS Chnlc and 

soon began looking for a new Job 
because he "didn't lIke working 
under a woman." When he 
inqUired a t UCSD and was 
interviewed by a woman, he 
didn't pursue the job opening 
Immediately. "The job 
applicallon sat on the coffee 
table for three years and then 1 
threw it away," he said. 

evenhe1ess, johnnie did get a 
Job at UCSD and has been 
content WIth it ever smce. 

Dunng his first two years at 
the univerSity, he worked In the 
secretarial offices located In the 
barracks left over from Camp 
Matthews, now Warren campus, 
where planning for the 
construction pC the futun" 
colleges was taking place. He 
recalled how the campus looked 

then: "There were a lot of tees 
and animals right by the Warren 
cafe . I sawall the animals driven 
away by the construction ." 

Johnnie also remembers the 
upnsi ngs on campw. that were 
going on in 1968 and 1969. 
· Students were doing a lot of 
protesllng .... It was very 
disruptive I didn 't know if I was 
gOIng to work the next day or

Later, JohnnIe was stiuioned to 
work at MUIr Co l\c.l1.e and [our 

years afterwards he moved to 
Revelle where he has been 
working ever since. 

When asked if he gets tired of 
the same roullne, j ohnnte hakes 
his head. ''You make your own 
variety. When the procedure gets 
monotonous, you change it 
around. It doesn 't really matter 
because the same work has to be 
done everyday." 

For johnnie , the key to lIking 
your job is getting along with 
your co·workers and supervisors. 
His theory is, "I f peo ple 'd take

misunderstandi ng) they'd find 
OUt who IS at fauft." 

For lhe most part, j ohnnte 
works Independently. He knows 
exactly what has to be done, a nd 
he goes about dOing It. At 9 am 
he and some of the other 
workers on his shift go outside 
for their 45 minute lunch break. 
They also have a colTee break at 
11 .30, for 15 mi nute~ Thev tlo 

not have to punch a time ca rd 
before and after their breaks. 
"We are trusted that far ... so 
far: he said . 

It is during these breaks and 
also while he is "getting things 
done" tha t Johnnie Interacts with 
students and faculty . Many of the 
students he encounters have 
chemistry and engineering 
classes in Urey Hall. "Some of 
[he students in diose labs are 
having a real tough time . Maybe 
they've been working on an idea 
they've had for weeks , but can't 
seem to get it right. I tell them to 
take a walk around the building 
or come talk to me ... and they 
Johnnie explains that "the 
bathroom on the first noor IS the 
hardest to keep clean be ausc so 
many people walk through the 
budding and use it · HIS pet

down my halls , especially after 
I've waxed them, reall y bugs me."

do," he said with a grin. 

Johnnie has made a lot of 
friend s this way and most of 
them are graduate srudents. "I 

jdon't know how many parties 
I've gone to after quarter finals 
are over with ," he laughs. 

However, not all Interactions 
between Johnnie and students 
are pleasant ones. More often 
than not the , "Bathroom Closed" 
signs are disregarded , making it 
necessaty to lock the doors while 
work IS being done Inside.

He adds, "Most of us lake pnde 
in our work ." 

Over the years , Johnnie has 
WItnessed the growth and 
expansion of not only the 
univerSity buildings, but the 
student population as well . 
"There 's a diffe rent variety of 
students now. Not bad , but 
differe nt. " 

. The recent strike by s tudents 
demand ing UC divestiture from 
South Africa had lillie effect on 
Johnnie's work schedule , though 
he views tha t and other student 
protests as worthwhile'. ''They 
(students) will get someplace 
with it. .. . They have gotten 
results in the past, like changing 
rules and regulations." He adds, 
'The students are offenng ~me 

InpUt on where and how Ihelr 
money IS to be pent." 

JohnnIe himself is prImarIly 
outspoken. His molto: "You step 
on my foot , ru step on yours." 
Most people would assume this 
when they see his 6-foot frame 
stride by In quick, concise steps; 
one would not guess that he is 
69 years old . 

It is miraculous thar Johnnie is 
sti ll performing the same tasks as 
always as he has been huTt seven 
or eight times, and has had three 
hean attacks on the Job. "When I 
worked at the gym I fell severa l 
times In the locker room because 
the floor would get so slippery," 
he said . "After that they put 
down some thing on the noor to 
prevent peo ple fro m slipping." 

johnnte 's "laSt heart attac k was 
three or four years ago . "I was 
hospitalized for three months or 
so ," he explains. He is diabetic 
now, and also complains about 
back pain . 

Despite these obstacles, 
however, he continues to keep 
up a steady pace. In fact, when 
Johnnie speaks of being put ·out 
to pasture" next summer at age 
70, one can tell he is not eage r 
to leave his Job. "I'd stay if I 
could ," he says. He likes the 
benefits of the job, especially 
since it was unionized this past 
year. "I really enjoy working 
here," he says, smiling. 

To su pplement his income , he 
collects aluminum cans around 
campus, and averages about 150 

The home of the 

FEATURES 

pound of cans a month. 
Sometimes he waits three or four 
months before he cashes In on 
his collection , depending on 
how his budget is going. "I only 
get paid once a month , so I have 
to stretch my money as far as I 
can," he explains. 

Johnnie lives alone now that 
his three daughters are aU grown 
and on their own . He van ·pools 
to work from hiS home in east 
San Oiego, though at one time 
he made the' commute by car. 

He plans on working after he 
must leave UCSD. "I'm a semi· 
profeSSIOnal car polisher. I'd Iike ~ 
to get my own shop and d o a 
couple of cars a day." Very 
marter-of.faculty he adds, "I can 
always find work." ~

Tritons Cruise past La Verne 
Seek Revenge at Clarelllont 
By AliCIA AGOS 

T ALK ABOUT A team clicking. Derek Al111strong's men's soccer 
team is continuing [0 do some 
phenomenal things out on 
Warren field . Last Wednesday's 
big game versus La Verne saw a 
large crowd come out to see the 
Tritons on to an easy 3-0 victory 
over La Verne. And It may have 
been the antIcs of the attendees 
- who included a boisterous 
water polo team, the volleyball 
teams and Joe Watson - that 
gave the Tritons the winning 
edge. 

Playing in front of fans who 
were continually clapping, 
laughing and doing the wave, 
team UCSD showed their very 
Impressive depth . Armstrong is 
at the head of a team which IS 
visibly getting stonger and 
stronger each season . In forwards 
Greg Schwarz, Bubba Wingate , 
Joe Giacalone and Roben 
Paterson , the Tritons spon a 
formidable offensive attack. But it 
is the depth of the team whIch 
has made the difference - an 
undefeated 16-0 difference in 
fact. 

Schwarz thinks that "the big 

dillerence this year is our 
offensive attack and our depth . 
La Verne said that if they 
marked me Out of the game, 
they'd beat us. There was a man 
on me the whole game . We 
scored three goals anyway. Three 
of our new players (Paterson, 
Giacalone , Craig Gross) are 
staning. We also have other 
freshmen who can come off the 
bench and we don't miss a beat." 

Half-back ScOtt Strom mer, who 
is also one of the athletir and 
field leaders of the team, sees the 
"depth of this team (as the 
number one factor). I can't think 
of one guy we 're not using. Two 
01 our guys can play any 
position. We have six seniors 
(captains Phil Kenney and 
Albeno Gomez, Denis Guttridge, 
Gary Dodge, Vic Skvarna and 
Barry Thompson) and our 
Intensity IS fantastic . Derek 
realizes thIS is the best lCam ever 
- there's no reason why we 
shouldn't go all the way." 

Anyone planning on getting in 
the Tritons' way will first have to 
get paSt Gomez, UCSD's goalie 
and co-captain. A grand tOlal of 
three goals have been scored on 

Gomez and his backup , Steve 
Guillan. Gomez is back on the 
squad after taking ht last season 
off. Schwarz commented 0 the 
imponance of his teammate by 
saying that "he's a leader on the 
team. All the new guys, and old 
guys, tOO, respect and follow 
what he does." 

This Wednesday is "Big 
Wednesday" for UCSD. They are 
traveling up to a school where 
fans scream at coaches and spit 
on players - yes folks , they're 
going to play Claremont-Mudd. 
The bad blood between these 
two teams runs deep, but Kun 
Bell sees it as just "another 
probable win ." Schwarz knows 
that in the paSt "we've psyched 
ourselves out. Claremont is no 
better than USIU , and we've 
beaten USIU. We've let 
Claremont beat us in the past." 

The bigget game of the year 
will give the Tritons a glimpse of 
what playoffs will be like, as 
UCSD will assuredly meet up 
against Claremont in the early 
rounds of the playoffs. And if 
their record is any indication of 
how the Tritons will do, 
Oaremont will have their hands 
full . ~ 

The Tritons have had a marvelous year in amassing their 16-0 record. Coach Derek Armstrong gives hiS squad 
instructions before a recent practice game at the Sports Arena against another prelly good team, the San Qiego 
Sackers. Birds of a feather . ..

Here they come 
By TODD 1WYMAN 

R UGBY-THE GAME that son of looks like football without the forward 
pass-is alive and well here at 
UCSD and ready to stan another 
season of fun and frolic . 

The oldest spon known and 
probably the most physically 
demanding bUI surely the most . 
confusing. This game has an end 
zone and uprights bUl you don't 
score lOuchdowns or field goals, 
you score a try Sound 
confusing? It gets worse , or 
better, depending on whether 
you're a mental masochist. They 
scrum, which is kind of like 
hiking the ball bUl through 
everybody's legs. They also try to 
score by running forward but 
passing the ball backward . See? 
Simple. 

Tom Buder, this club's coach 
and also a member of the panel 
that selects the players for the 
All-Cal rugby team that 
represents Nonh America, says 
he 'gets good athletes teUing him 
that rugby is the hardest game 
they've ever played. Hardest is 
the key word in that phrase, 

because in this game ~ art' 
no pads bur: more hitting than 
any game of "kill the guy widt 
the baD,ft which is usualy what it 
looks Iike_ 

Really tho~h, n.¢V lS a game 
of strategy and precision. 
Obviously, the objects of the 
game is to score the most points 
eIther by kicking the baD on the 
dead run through the uprights or 
by running it in and setting it on 
the ground. BUl u's not JUst a 
maner of damaging the 
opponent's Ixxfy on the way to a 
score; it's a maner of finesse and 
technique that really makes the 
game ime res 0 ng. 

Not only do coordination and 
brawn make a gooct player, being 
in condition makes a better 
player. In fact, out of the l25 
athletes that signed up to play, 
only 55 remain. That may seem 
like a lot, but there are no 
substitutions aIowed until half 
time or because of a serious 
injury. That's i;O minlUS per half 
of pure running_ This makts for

'fritons impressive 
Despite loss to Pomona 

vulnerable," explained coach 
John Leaney. Pomona had to 
.work for every goal as the 
Tritons never slowed their pace. 
Leaney cited lhis game as 
indicative of the team's progress 
in the season. Earlier in the 
season they had played Pomona 
and were beaten 2-0, but played 
a far less confident game. The 
Broncos barely had to sweat to 
score a goal, while on Friday 
both teams played a "tough , 
physical game." 

game ." Alter lOSing lhe first goal 
the Tritons were denied a 
penalty that would have given 
them a chance to Stay with 
Pomona. Analyzing the game, 
L..eaney felt that at that point he 
had intimidaled the referee . and 
from then on the officiating 
seemed one-sided. And the 
wrong side, at thaI. 

Ruggers 
By STEPHANIE KAUS 

I T'S BE~N A GOOD season for women s soccer - not outstanding, but their willingness to play aggressive - there is no room for tentativeness in this sport. 
Even if the competition is much 
stronger, the Tritons still attack, 
thereby enabling them to grow 
and improve. 

Continued from page 16 
the end of these matches, but 
the trophy is always worth it: the 
keg. definitely good . Each game, won 

or lost , has revealed a stronger 
and more aggressive team able to 
hold its own amongst some of 
the toughest soccer teams 
around. After beginning the 
season with four consecutive 
losses, the Tritons were able to 
pull together, study their 
mistakes, and start winning. 

The key to their success is 

Friday afternoon's match with 
Cal Poly Pomona was a n 
example of this philosophy. 
Although they lost 4-0, UCSD 
was definitely in the game the 
entire lime. "We attacked and in 
attacking left ourselves 

Unfonunately for San Diego, 
lhe game was marred by what 
Leaney thought was poor 
officiating. The referee was "the 
worst I've seen in my two yers at 
San Diego," according to Leaney, 
"and was a definite factor in the 

But for the Tritons, this is just 
another learning experience. The 
team is now 9-9-1 with only 
three games left, but this figure 
does not renect their progress 
and improvement . 

Playing this brutal but beautiful 
game must knock a cog loose in 
these guys' skulls. After a long 
hard day of scrumming and

don't just have a Lite beer from
