Academic stress: there is help 
By LE LIE BOW 

You've just turned out the 
I ight at t he end of "one of those 
days" and have entered the 
unavoidable nightly routine of 
thinking before you I ep. 
Classes are terrible, you're 
having trouble WIth your sui-
temates, you haven't gotten 
any mail in week'. udd nly, 
tear' are stinging your eyelids. 
You turn and face the wall so 
your roommate won't see your 
si llines. "Oh God I'm so 
lonely," you think. But you 
know there's nothing really 
wrong with you - you're rea-
sonably intelligent , not bad 
looking, and you and several 
friends are going to TJ this 
week nd . So what's the 
problem? 

"Life," says Dr. Phil 
Raphael of the Third College 
Psychological and Counseling 
ervices, "".Fears are univer-

saL" If you think you're th 
only one who feel isolated , 
confused or depres ed, you're 
f1a.t tering your. elf with 
untquen s . 

UC D is a fairly large uni-
versity into which you, the 
lowly undergraudate, are 
dropped along with hundred 
of ot her . The academic stand-
ards here are high. Competi-
tion i ' keen . Living on campus 
you find your elf surrounded 
by your peer , immersed in a 
24 hour a day social situation 
with every minute a Ie on in 
gelling along with people. It 
seems you have the right to 
feel depressed . It would be 
abnormal not to feel 0 ial and 
academic pres ure once in a 
while. But what happens 
when tho e "once in a whiles" 
occur more and more 
frequently? 

It is important to r alize 
where the problem is coming 
from. l ually , you don 't have 
to look very far. 

"Th major pressure is the 
pre:. ur that you put on your-
self for academic perfor-
mance." says John Giebink, 
director of Psychological and 
Counseling ervices at UC D. 
Certainly everyone feels that 
current of competitiveness 
that run through the lecture 
hall right fore a mIdterm. 
You look . teathily around the 
room wondering, "Doe. he 
know something about Varia-
tion of Parameters that I don't? 
Why does everyone look so 
calm? Am r the only one here 
gelling a stomachache?" 

"Stress is not bad".it pushes 
us, it challenges us, it brings 
out the best in u . However, we 
can become ovprloaded by put-
ting unrealistic d mands on 
ourselves and making assump-
tions that increase stress 
beyond a person's ability to 
cope. That's when you have 
burnout and are unable to keep 
thing. together," says Dr. Ron 
Lane of the Muir College Psy-
chological ervice. The pres-
sure to achieve keep u going, 
but a one Muir freshman aid 
in a re igned tone, "Some-
times it ju ,t eems everyone's 
just out for t he grade." When 
you think that you can't ke p 
up with everything, that pro-
fe 'sor are unrea:onable, or 
that you're just plain ·tupid, it 
is easy to imagine you ar 
alone. Yet everyone feels the 
pressure to ucceed . The dif-
ference lies in how people 
choose to handle it. "The suc-
ces ful student will not allow 
the st ress to get them down to 
the point where they will leave 
school. They will keep . lug-
ging away." says Lane. 

Common gripes include 
"There's nothing to do" and " I 
can't meet people on this cam-
pu .. " In an institution with 
10,000 students it i ea y to 
di . olve into them and become 
ignored. Your life is in a lump 
becau e you're so busy you 
don't have time to do the 
thing' you like with the people 
you like - they're all bu y too. 
"UCSD is uch an unfriendly 
place, I can't meet people or 
make new friend ." Dissati -
faction grows and you blame it 
on the ·ystem. "That kind of 
feeling is almost univer ai, 
period." says Raphael. " ome 
p pIe feel that it's very diffi -
cult to make friends here: 'if I 
go S0 m where el e I can made 
friends.' That may be true, it 
may not be true. But [ think 
the first thing a per on has to 
look at is,,. them elves. What 
we would do is help that per-
son find ways to overcome his 
shyness or this fear of meeting 
people and begin to utili ze 
behaviors which could maxim-
ize meeting new people. Basi-
cally what you're talking 
about is taking rio ks. " 

Well, maybe you feel you do 
meet a lot of people. r n fact, you 
think there are too many peo-
ple. You've 10 t your individu-
ality becau. e c1asse are too 
large. You wonder if you are 
deviant because you do not 

drink er, understand pro· 
grammable calculators, wear a 
polo shirt, study on unda, 
and party it up on Friday. You 
thtnk you shou ld be doing 
\\ hat everyone else does or you 
are out of place. In living on 
campus with people your own 
age there is a definit pressure 
to conform. 

Giebink notes, "When [ go 
into the dorms I fe I pres:-,u· 
re ... everything's so jammed 
toget her - that' . got to cause 
some stres .. " And if he feels It 
a a visitor, it's got to be real 
for the impressIOnable student 
who has not vet had his indi-
\,iduality stamped on him. 
[rene, a chemistry major, was 
studying in a near empty HL 
on a aturday night. Isn't 
there a stigma attached to 
studying when no one else is? 
"Everyone from my little sis-
ter to my best friend has been 
telling me I shou Id get out 
more. I was made to feel guilt .... 
about that...but It'S really you-r 
choice." 

Lane comments, "A per on 
who is subject to conformltv 
pressures may have grown up 
feeling like they need to win 
people' apprO\ al. They judge 
their self worth by other peo-
ple's reacton to them. At this 
age it's common because many 
student at this point may not 
have a trong sen e of individ-
uality yet to know what they 
want." Raphael ays, "If their 
roommate are invol ved in var-
ious kind of intimate relation-
ships and that per. on n ver 
has (been), often times that 
person will feel t he need to 
either begin to engage in those 
kind of behavior. or a need to 
imply that they do. (People will 
ask) 'You don't like to be 
enf,aged in intimate relation-
ships? What's wrong \\'Ith 
you?' And, given that, it does 
put a lot or pre sure on a per-
son."to conform. Wh at \\e try 
to do i find a way of dealing 
with those kinds of conflicts 
that is comfortable." 

o when you feel that 
classes are too much to handle 
and people are getting on your 
nerve. , what do you do about 
it? "I try to swim e\'ery day," 
says one Muir freshman. "[ 
call home" or H[ confide in a 
good friend, it helps just to 
talk," say others. There are 
lot of ways to d al with 
stress." ome need to learn to 
relax, to balance their life with 
recreat ion . Others need to 

learn to use time more df! 
cientl .... , or learn sorial skIlls to 
balance the "tud .. ," "a\'s Lane.

ground floor of HL and ha\'

Letters to the Editor 

Reagan's devastation 
Editor: 

The results of the first year 
of the Reagan administration 
are beginning to be felt. Every 
day I either overhear or 
participate in a conversation 
in which some aspect of 
Reagan policy is decried (of 
course none of the participant 
admit to having voted 
RepUblican). Most often 
Reaganomics and military 
involvement in Central 
America are criticized. With 
these pressing thoughts, some 
very important threat of the 
Reagan administrat ion are 
often overlooked, ones that are 
of particular interest to 
younger America. 

The "squeal" rule that may 
cause many unnecessa ry 

teenage pregnancie and the 
pushing of a n ti-abortion 
legislation through Senate 
committees have occurred too 
easi ly , and may be only the 
first restrictions of personal 
freedom . If the majority of 
Americans that the polls 
indicate are in favor of 
legalized abortions don 't make 
their feelings felt, their 
complacency and ilence may 
be interpreted as approval. 

It would certainly be a 
tragedy to wake up one day 
and find that many of our 
individual rights have been 
curtailed. I hope the result of 
the upcoming congre sional 
elect ions will reverse this 
trend.

Hassles with math 
Editor: 

It would appear that this 
school should change its 
y tem for adding math 

classes. I have never been able 
to obtain a math course 
straight off, always having to 
cra h cia ses wit h hope of 
being admitted. Now I no 
longer worry. Everyone who 
crashes, seems to get 
admitted. Why force people to 

A Different Angle 

go through this? 
Why not just open more 

sect ion and math classes to 
begin with? Since almost 
everyone attending school 
here mu t take math, why 
have so few cia e? It just 
doesn't make sense. Oh well. 

ee you at the registrar with 
your add card.

An 'apple' for schools 
WASHINGTON - Steven 

Jobs is again grabbing 
headlines, this time with an 
offer to put a personal 

comput~r - free of charge -
in each of America's 75,000 
public elementary and 
secondary schools. 

The 27-year-old co-founder 
of Apple Computer. Inc. says 
he wants to help schools 
address a nagging "computer 
illiteracy" problem among 
young American. He's even 
willing to give up $200·to-$300 
million worth of new "Apple 
Irs," each with a retail value 
of about $2.495. 

There's a small catch, of 
course. Job want Congres to 
give his company - or any 
other so interested - a 
charitable tax deduction of up 
to 30 percent for the donation 
of high·tech equipment to 
public schools. With the 
inevitable promotional gain, 
Apple (which had $39.4 million 
in net earnings last year of 

sales of $335 million) would 
probably end up ahead. 

Though co ngressmen 
clamor about deficits, many 
aren't distracted by the $20·to-
$30 million in potential 
Treasury 10 ses resulting 
from the so-ca lled "Technolo· 
gy Act of 1982." At last count, 
43 House members had signed 
their names to the legislation. 
Given reductions in federal aid 
to education and scientific 
re earch. some sponsors 
believe Apple's apparent 
altruism is the sort of 
corporate behavior that needs 
to be encouraged. 

Others wi ll simply endorse 
any measure designed to 
counter the threat from 
America's high-technology 
competitors. As "Zero Sum" 
economist Lester C . Thurow 
of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology s uggests, 
Japanese product. are better 
engineered than our own 
because Japan's schools churn 

out twice as many engineers as 
their US counterparts. 

"We're having a big problem 
get ting kid to study mat hand 
science," contend Rep. 
Fortney H. Stark (D·Cali f.), a 
leading co·sponsor of the 
"Apple bill." "If a tax break 
helps to stimulate interest in 
tech nology an d tech nica I 
education, then it' a good 
investment. " 

Indeed , relatively few school 
districts have made much 
effort to integrate high 
technology into their 
curricula. According to a 
su rvey pu blished last year by 
the National Center for 
Educational Statistics, only 
one in four public schools 
keeps a micro-computer for 
in tructional use by students; 
nearly one in five lacks access 
to computers of any ort. 

Meanwhile, says Andrew R. 
Molnar , a program director at 
the National Science Founda·

Studying for finals the western way 
By TIM PICKWELL 

My friend has a strange way 
to study for finals . He reads 
Westerns. Two, sometimes 
three orfour a day. Zane Grey, 
Frank O'Rourke, Louis 
L'Amour. Any thing with asix· 
gun and a girl. He claim it 
relieves the ten ion of finals 
week. "Some people watch 
T .V.," he told me, "I read 

we~terns . It makes me forget 
the pre sure of all that 
studying." 

"What studying?" I asked 
him. "You never study. Every 
time I'm reading Byron, you're 
reading Brand. 

"Exactly," he said, "and 
look how uptight you are, and 
how calm I am." 

He had a point. 0 I left him 
to his cowboys and Indians, 
and went to cram for Calcu Ius. 
It was Tuesday. The next day, 
two hours before our math 
final, I found him in the 
library, feet propped on a desk. 
He wa reading The War OJI 
Charity Ross. 

" I'm coming to the good 
part ," he explained . "The evil 
rancher is trYIng to pUSh the 
homesteaders off his graze,

for The Guardian 

but the beautiful redhead talks 
the gunfighter who's lost his 
nerve into tying his guns on 
again, and then he tames the 
town and saves t he farm." 

I arched an eyebrow. 
"Well, something like that," 

he said. "After a while they all 
sort of run together." He put 
the book down. "] read this one 
during Fall finals anyway." 

"How do you do it?" I a ked 
him. "Most people study all 
day during finals and you 
never evpn open a textbook." 

He grinned. "My intelli· 
gence. brains .. . " 

"No, the truth." 
So he told me. "Most people 

get so tense during finals. their 
stomachs turn into little 
billiard balls. But not me. I 
relax. take it easy. Life is too 
short to waste time worrying 
about a final." 

"Sure," ] said, "and how do 
you do on these te ts?" 

" Invariably well," he 
bragged . "Everyone el e in a 
class is so choked up with 
worrying, I just saunter in, 
relax, and breeze through." 

"' .... '" 

The next time I saw him 
was Friday in the Humanities 
Library . I had gone there to 

study for the blgone-ourLit 
test Saturday. My friend was 
reading something, it had a 
fierce looking Comanche on 
the cover. 

"How's going?" he drawled. 
"Fine. But aren ' t you even 

going to study for Lit 
tomorrow?" 

"And get uptight?" He 
looked incredulous. 

"But," I tried to hammer 
orne sen e into him, "it's 50 

percent of our grade! Fifty 
percent! You ' ve got to study!" 

"If I don't know it by now," 
he replied, "I never will. 
Beside, this is literature. " He 
tapped his paperback . 

I snorted . 
"No. it is," he insisted. 

"Listen to this: 'Morgan's gun 
was booming methodically, 
and every shot fou nd a place in 
his ample target; but none of it 
see med to trouble Ernie 
Crouch. Bot h guns lifted 
irrevocably in hi ham fists 
and both guns went off once 
each, before Crouch finally 
tilted like an axed redwood 
tree and cra hed to the earth 
with a blow that seemed to 
shake the town.' " My fri end 
had a far·away, hazy look In 
his eyes. He sighed . "Now 
that's Writing. The meta · 

phors, the imagery. the 
mood.... Much better than 
Milton." 

"See you in c1as ," ] sa id 
turning away. "And good luck 
- I think you're going to need 
it . " 

He laughed goodnaturedly. 
**** 

At one minute past the hour 
my friend walked into class. 
He had a couple of blue books 
in his hand. He took t he essay 
question from the profe sor, 
and winked at me. "Piece 0' 
cake," he said . 

A couple of times during the 
next three hours I glanced over 
to where he was sitting. He 
was writing furious ly each 
time. 

Maybe, I told myself, he 
really does know the stuff. 
Maybe he does have the right 
idea. 

Over t he break I thought of 
my friend occasionally. It was 
odd how he could loaf through 
finals week while many were 
in misery around him. Perhaps 
I was jealous. People always 
seem to resent those who are 
enjoyi ng t hemselves when 
they themselve are suffering. 
Wa. that what r was doing? 

My friend came back from 

vacation early. On Saturday 
we walked over to our 
professor's office to pick up 
our tests . As we passed 
through the Humanities 
Building, he tried to convert 
me to his way of studying. 

"Look," he said, "I made it 
through finals week. Everyone 
else was jumpy, breaking out, 
and getting ulcers, but not me. 
No sir, I was calm and cool. I 
wal ked into each final fresh as 
a daisy, and came out smelling 
like a rose." 

We came to the prot's door 
and searched in the stack for 
our blue book . 

Here's mine," he said. "And 
just like I to ld you," he turned 
to the back of his essay, " I got a 
- WHA T!" He shrieked and 
dropped the book. He turned 
pale and slumped agai nst the 
wall, moaning soft ly. I t hink 
he fainted. 

The hall was quiet. 
Carefu lly I looked around. I 

picked up his book and idly 
leafed through it to the la t 
page. A big, red F was inked 
into the paper. Below it the 
professor had left a small 
comment. 

"Bang! Bang!" it read . "You 
flunk."

Pacific News Service 

Reagan budget amendment close to approval 
By MARY ELLEN LEARY 

Pacific News Service 
SAN FRANCISCO - Lo tin 

the clamor over tax cuts, 
military spending and New 
Federali m, the real center-
piece of President Reagan 's 
plans for reshaping the federal 
government is quietly moving 
toward reality. 

The Reagan-supported 
campaign for a constitutional 
amendment to cap federal 

pending and taxing now is 
just three states short of the 
required two-thirds majority. 
Its progress through state 
legi latures has largely been 
eclip ed by the more 
controversial fate of another 
proposed constitutional 
c hange, the Equal Righ ts 
Amendment. 

But many observers agree 
that passage of the Balanced 
Budget / Tax Lim itation 
Constitutional Amendment 
appears far more certain than 
the apparently doomed ERA. 

The proposed amendment 
wou ld put an end to deficit 
financing of the federal 
government and impose a lid 
on the rate by which federal 
spending grows so that it 
never outruns the pace of 
national income. These two 
restrictions would impose 
monumental changes in how 
Washington works. They 
would be, in fact , the real 
cornerstone of Reaganomics. 

Some observers believe that 
a year of worsening recession 

and the largest deficit budget 
ever - a deficit nearing $1 
trillion - is an odd time to 
press for an irrevocable cap on 
resources available to 
Washington. But advocates of 
the amendment, including the 
president, see advantages to 
their cau e in t he current 
fiscal crisis. 

The birth of this campaign, 
as far a President Reagan i 
concerned, occurred roughly 
10 years ago. As governor of 
California , Reagan personally 
sponsored an initiative at a 
special 1973 election which 
proposed fixing a limit to 
California's year-to·year tate 
spending increases and 
freezing expenditure in the 
state budget to a fixed port ion 
of all California's p rsonal 
income. The aim wa to keep 
government from encroaching 
further on the pu blic's purse. 
Though the voters rejected it , 
this was the harbinger of the 
1978 Proposition 13 tax 
rebellion . This , in turn, 
triggered parallel tax 
reduction moves or restraints 
on government pending in 
numerous other tates. 

Today the arne conserva· 
tive economi ts and moneta· 
rists who fas hioned that 
unsuccessful 1973 plan for 
California, led largely by Dr. 
Milton Friedman. have 
masterminded a pincer move 
guaranteed to focus national 
attention in 1982 on the drive 
to impose just such a formula 

on Washington. 
One arm of the pincers 

approaches this fiscal change 
through a succession of state 
legis lative resolutions calling 
for a national constitutional 
convention. Its purpose would 
be to bar future federal deficit 
spending and to put a limit on 
revenues the government can 
coll ect each year. This 
movement ha s garnered 
support from an odd 
assortment of politicians 
including at one point the 
frugal Gov. Jerry Brown of 
California. Brown hasn ' t 
mentioned it lately, since hi 
US Senate race require 
careful adherence to Democra· 
tic party principles. 

So far, w.ith mo t recent 
action by Alaska. 31 states 
have called for aconstitutional 
convention to take up this 
issue. Wa shington state, 
Kentucky and Missouri now 
are locked in debate over it. 
Only 34 states are needed to 
mandate a convention . 

The second arm of the 
pincer is Congress . Duplicate 
language for a constitutional 
amendment has been intro-
duced with 60 co ponsor on 
t he Senate side and 170 
cospon. ors in the Hou e. The 
Senate measure, already 
passed by the Judiciary 
Committee last May, is 
expected to come up for debate 
and a vote thi . spring. Action 
on the House ver ' ion will not 
be 0 wift, since liberal 

committee chairmen have 
blocked the way. 

The fa. t-movlng threat of a 
state-mandated constItutional 
convention is expected to force 
congressional action on the 
amendment. A convention, 
which would require coopera-
tion from Congre s, never has 
been used to amend the 
Constitution since the initial 
drafting in 1787, and Congress 
is not eager to allow a 
precedent now. Summoning 
citizens for a hot at 
redesigning even one lIttle 
segment of the ConstitutIOn IS 
viewed in Washington as an 
invitation to havoc - a giant 
Pandora's Box warming WIth 
every single-issue advocate 
and special-interest faction . 
Instead of inviting this 
mischief, Congress prefers 
what has become the 
customary amendment 
practice: a two-third ' vote in 
each Hou e, referring the 
matter then for ratIfication by 
two-thirds of the states. Thl 
move can foil a convent ion call. 

For more than ix years 
organized proponent of curl:>!' 
on government have toiled to 
contrive just this pincer force 
on Congress. Key groups are 
the National Tax Limitation 
Committee and the National 
Taxpayers' Union (NTUl. The 
first is close to President 
Reagan and is led by his former 
aide, Lewis K. Uhler. Its prime 
objective IS to co nfine 
government taxes to a set 

ration of natIOnal Income so 
they cannot grow faster than 
the total economy. ThI S 
guarantees to the' pm,ate 
sector that It shall not be 
eroded further . 

Language in SectIOn 2 of the 
propo ed amendment asserts 
that total federal receipts 
(taxes) In any fi scal year shall 
not increase by a rate greater 
than the increase of national 
income in t he previous 
calendar year 

The. TU 's goal ha been a 
balanced budget With no 
deficit. ThiS IS set out In 

ect IOn I of t he proposed 
amendment. ft calls for a 
congressIOnal "statement " 
each year of anticipated 
receipt s and anticipated 
outlays - and requires them 
to balance. Deficit spending 
beyond this Inttial statement 
would be allowed only upon a 
three-fifths vote of Congress. 

The ·tark reality of the 
pre ent alarming defiCIt. 
though unmentIoned in the 
proposal, is recognized . The 
amendment would make an 
exemption to the prescribed 
"balance" to allow paying off 
past debt s. 

As the bandwagon of 
support for the amendment 
has gamed momentum . cores 
of leading theoretiCIans and 
politicians have taken up the 
public battle, pro and con.

to have equ ipped each of it 
schools with a micro-computer 
by the end of this year_ The 
j apanese and French, among 
others, have also made a 
national policy of computer 
education. 

Unfortunately, Steven Jobs' 
offer to put an "Apple" in 
every US elementary and 
secondary chool doesn't begin 
to address two pecu I ia rly 
American problems: a 
shortage of competent math 
and cience teachers at every 
educat ional level and the 
outdated nature of math and 
science curricula_ 

Stark and hi s fellow 
congressional computer buffs 
may require Ap'ple - if the 
company doesn t volunteer -
to provide teacher training in 
return for any favors on the 
tax side_ 

Without adequate prepara-
tion. however. we're fooling 
ourselves to think computers 
alone are the simple an wer to 
more high-minded foreign 
competi tors_ Jobs' "Apple give-
away" smells of a pork barrel 
as long as the US lacks a 
coherent education policy 
programmed for the computer

U CSD Doc is hopeful in Senate race 
By NICK HANNA 

Staff Writer 

For the pa t ten years, Dr. 
Daniel Kripke has bt.'en one of 
t he most respected and 
admired member of the 
UCSD community_ He is cur-
renlly an associate professor 
of psychiatry, as well as physi-
cian and researcher at Univer-
si ty Hospital. 

Early in March , however, 
Dr. Kripke decided that he 
would be of greater use as a 
state senator, where he cou ld 
employ his talents to preserve 
and enhance the quality of life 
for all Californians_ 

He announced that he will 
be a Democratic candidate for 
the 38th senatorial seat. The 
38th district stretches from 
Pacific Beach to Oceanside, 
including UCSD_

Health 
Sciences 
to be cut 

BY HENRY CH LMAN 
Sacramento Corre~pondenl 

The University of Califor-
nia's plan to offset state and 
federal budget cuts by reduc-
ing graduate and health scien-
ces enrollment by ] ,355 over 
four years highlighted a 
budget hearing in the Assem-
bly Wa ys and Means educa-
lion subcommi ttee recently. 

The subcommittee decided 
to defer discu sion and action 
on most controversial Uni ver-
sity budget items - research 
funds. capital outlay and stu -
dent fee levels - until April or 
May, when they will have a 
clearer pict ure of 1982-83 
revenues. 

the incumbant Republi can 
William Craven. 

The following is the trans-
cript from a Guardian inter-
view with Kripke. 
Guardian: What convinced 
you to forego you r medical 
career and enter politics? 
Kripke: I think we see that 
events are taking a very sorry 
turn in our community and in 
the country a a whole. We 
have to have a government 
that makes wi er decisions 
and that provides better lead-
ership_ r didn't feel that J 
wanted to sit back and watch 
things go from bad to worse_ I 
felt that I wanted to stand up 
and do something about it. 
Guardian: Do you feel that 
the role of technical speciali ts 
in government should be 
enha nced? 
Kripke: Sure, I'm a doctor 

and a teacher and a scientist; 
about two-thirds of the budget 
goes towards medical care and 
education , which is where I'm 
an expert. The leading edge of 
California's economy i high 
technology, since I understand 
computers, electronic, and 
biotechnology; I underst and 
the areas where California's 
economy has to grow_ 
Guardian: What do you see as 
the mo t important issues fac-
ing Californians, and in partic-
ular the people of the 38th 
di trict? 
Kripke: The most important 
issue i empleyment Unles 
we improve employment. 
nothing else in our economy, in 
our equal opportunity, our 
social services. our education 
or national security can go 
well. 
Guardian: How do you view 

the performance of your oppo-
nent William Craven? 
Kripke: I think that Senator 
Craven has not been a very 
active senator. It' s very hard 
to say exactly what he's done 
for the district ; certainly he's 
done very little for UCSD. He's 
done very little for the high 
technology indu trie that 
represent the economic future 
of the di trict. 
Guardian: Do you feel that 
you will be bet ter able to pro-
tect the interests of UC D 
than your opponent? 
Kripke: Sure, since UCSD is 
the largest non -military 
employer in the district, It'S 
clearly, then, an important 
duty of the district tate ena-
tor to try and help UCSD _ To 
do that, first of all, you have to 
understand the campus_ Hav-
ing worked here for ten years 

and my Wife haVing worked 
here for ten years. r think I do_ 
The second thing is energy and 
interest. The squeaky wheel 
gets the grease. If a state sena-
tor from this district i WIlling

Health cuts examined 
continued from page 7 
tions by member of the legi -
lative analyst' office. 

But when the subcommittee 
began discussing cut in the 
health ciences , which include 
the medical dental and veteri-
nary schools, UC Academic 
Vice President William Frazer 
was asked to tell the su bcom-
mittee why these fields were 
singled out for educational 
cuts. 

Gov. Brown has uAAested 
a $29 million reduction of state 
general funds to the univer-
sity. The University must also 
return over $4 million to the 
state in unused salaries, neces-
sitating a total of $33 million 
worth of cuts. 

The University plans to 
offset most of the loss with 

increased student fees. 
reduced administrative costs. 
and reduced DU blic service. 

But $8 million worth of 
reduction must be made in pro-
gram cuts, and based on a long 
series of criteria, UC budget 
officials decided that cutting 
$6 million from health scien-
ces and $2 million from general 
campus graduate education 
would cause the least 
hardship. 

This saving wou ld result in 
1.355 fewer student and 182 
fewer faculty. But Frazer said 
yesterday the reductions 
wou ld be effected by attrition 
over four years; no students 
would be forced to leave school 
and no faculty would be laid 
off.

the university. then that's 
going to get results. 
Guardian: In the past, you 
have mentioned the increasing 
cost of medical care in this 
country. How would you deal 
with this controversial issue? 
Kripke: From the end of 
World War II to the present 
time, medical costs have 
increased, not only in dollars, 
because of inflation and 
growth in population, but also 
as a percentage of gros 
national product, from about 
four percent to now over ten 
percent. It looks like there will 
be strong pressure for the e 
costs to increase, both becau e 
medical technology continu es 
to develop and because the pro-
portion of the population over 
sixty·five i growing steadily, 
and will continue to grow, and 
they are the biggest user of 
medical care. It IS unclear 
whether our society can or will 
wish to afford the still ever 
increasing expenditure for 
medical care. I think there will 
be increasing demand and 
pressure to control co ts, but 
we don't want to sacrifice 
quality. We will have to look 
for ways to maintain quality 
and availability, while control· 
ling the co ts bet ter. I think 

t he state government has an 
important role in that, and I 
thir,:, that would be an area in 
which I would work very hard 
in the legislat ure. It's not an 
area where there is a single 
solut ion . It has to be solved by 
doctors and the public and 
government working together. 
My emphasis will be not on 
trying to come up with all of 
the answers myself, but on try-
ing to produce a consensus. 
Guardian: Finally . how is the 
campaign going? Do you think 
that you will be able to build up 
enough support to beat the 
incumbant? 
Kripke: There are many 
things that will happen 
between now and the e lection. 
I don'tthink that we are going 
to be able to predict the out-
come until election eve. We 
know that many voters are not 
going to make up their minds 
until the last week. I think, 
however, that things are gomg 
very well and I think that [ 
have a very fair chance of win-
ning. The UCSD campus is 
really very crucial to the stra-
tegy of my campaign. If stu-
dent apathy continues; if 

tudents don't vote and work 
on the election, then I'm not 
going to do very well. If the

which he wrote, "it is IroniC 
that the University is being 
forced to cut back its graduate 
programs at the same time 
t hat there is widespread recog-

Lecture and slides on vernal pools 
The Lawrence Livermore 

National Laboratory recently 
awarded a $1.2 mi ll ion con-
tract to TRW, Inc, of Redondo 
Beach, to participate in the 
conceptual design for a fusion 
reactor. the electric power 
plant of the 21st century, 

fuse , thus creating a great deal 
of energy. Then this energy 
can be harnessed and con-
verted into electricity for our 
homes. 

On Thursday, April 15th al 
7:30 p.m., the San Diego Natu· 
ral History Museum will pre ·

given by Mitchel Beauchamp, 
a well·known botanist wh 
has led the drive to save San 
Diego's vernal pools, A special 
photographic ex hibit of vernal 
pool photographs, taken by 
Michael Evans, will also be on 
display that evening. 

Primarily a spring pheno·

Fusion energy, the thermo· 
nuclear reaction that drives 
the sun and the stars, may one 
day be the energy source that 
powers human society. 

While scienti ts at the lab 
work to develop fusion energy 
for commerical use, this new 
20-month project, called Mir-
ror Advanced Reactor Study 
(MARS), will provide the con-
ceptual design for a tandem 
mirror reactor - a fusion 
power plant. 

The Laboratory, TRW and 
the University of Wisconsi n 
are working together on the 
$3.1 million MARS project 
which is managed byCarl Hen· 
ning and Grant Logan of 
LLNL. Of the $3.1 million dol · 
lar project, $700,000 were allo-
cated to Wiscons in University. 
$1.2 million to LLNL and the

nessing fusion power, the tan-
dem mirror i being developed 
at LLNL. This experiment 
uses magnetic fields to sustain 
the fusion reaction. Theway it 
works is that magnetic fields 
prevent the ions (fuel of the 
reaction, usually deuterium 
and tritium) from touching the 
vessel walls. which would cool 
them down. Instead, the ions 
are heated to very hot tempera-
ture - 100 million degrees 
Centigrade. The hot tempera-
ture (wh ich increases the 
veloc ity of the ions) increases 
the probability of the ions col-
liding with one another. And 
when the ions collide. they

'Chariots of Fire' 

• • a surprIse \vlnner 
Fonda and Hepburn each receive 
Oscars at 54th annual ceremony 

BY ANDREW KEELER 
Arts Editor 

Monday night' Academy 
Awards were filled wit h pre-
dictable picks and archaic 
s peeches, and one outstanding 
surprise. 

Johnny Carson hosted the 
54th annual awards ceremony 
that turned into a three-and-a· 
half hour marathon . The 
heavy favorite, Reds, which 
was nominated for 12 Oscars, 
grabbed only three. One of 
tho e went to the multi-
talented Warren Beatty, who 
collected the be t director for 
his epic, which he also pro-
duced and starred in. 

Achievement award ' were 
given to Dann y Kaye and Bar-
bara Stynwyck, who were 
greeted with s tanding ova-
tions. An award hould have 
been given to Bette Midler for 
most entertaining presenter. 
She joked with the crowd, and 
even took a pot s hot at the 
Academy, ' 'I'm still waiting 
for them to call. and admit 
they made a mistake" she said 
referring to her overlooked 
performance in the Rose. She 
was by far the highlight of an 
ot herwise tedious affair. 

An easy prediction was 
Henry Fonda's Best Actor 
award for hi role in 011 Golden 
POI/d. The 76-year-old actor 
had never won an Oscar 
before, and probably would not 

have had another chance due 
to his illness. Whether he wa 
better than the other is incon-
equential since he was the 

heavy sentimental favorite. 
Fonda' daughter , Jane, 
accepted the award and pro-
ceeded to deliver the longest 
speech of the evening leaving 
nothing unsaid. 

In the overall awards race, 
Raiders o/Ihe Losl Arkgrabbed 
five, followed by Reds and Cha-
n'ols 0/ Fire, which each pulled 
in three. 

The biggest surprise of the 
evening was the Best Picture 
award which went to the Eng-
lish film Chariots 0/ Fire. This 
wa a heavy underdog to such 
films as Reds, and On Golden 
Pond. Even Loretta Young, 
who pre ented the award, 
looked a lillIe stunned when 
she read it. 

Fonda 's partner in On 
Golden Pond, Katharine Hep-
burn, was voted Best Actress. 
For the 72-year-old Hepburn, 
this was her fourth Oscar. She 
was another of the sentimen-
tal favorites that dominated 
the ceremony. 

Be t Supporting Actor went 
to Sir John Gielgud for his role 
as Dudley Moore' guardian in 
Arthur. Maureen Stapleton of 
Reds was voted in the Support-

Rocky Horror Picture 
Show to play tonight 

The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show will be shown on campus 
tonight for the econd time in 
UCSD's history . First pro-
duced as a plar in the early 
60s, this movie s spicy scenes 
and hilarious commentaries 
de tined Rocky Horror to 
become a midnight cult c1as· 
sic. Today it is a box office suc· 
cess with faithful follower 
lining up at weekend show· 
time in cities across the 
nat ion. Rocky Horror has vio· 
lated the silver screen every 
weekend at its traditional mid · 
night hour in the theatre runs 
of up to five years, and con· 
tinue to draw its crazy, 
excited, dedicated crowd. 
These people know they're 
waiting for the most fun and 
festive movie event around. 

If you enjoy ex, you' ll enjoy 
Rocky Horror. Even if you have 
reservations, though , you sti ll 
should see this film. This 
movie is in no way pornogra· 
phic. Rather, it make fun of 

sexual behavior. The movie is 
et in a typical haunted ca tIe, 

but there's a twist. The cast le 
is packed wi th deJightfu I 
deviants partying it up with 
their leader, the transsexual 
transvestite transylvanian 
scientist Dr. Frankenfurter. 

This doctor challenges Brad 
and Janet, two stereotypical 
straight-laced prudes to "give 
(themselves) over to ab olute 
pleasure," thus challenging 
middle class sexual morality . 
The audience takes Franken· 
furter's side and cheers him 
on. Everyone has a great time 
watch ing the violat ion of their 
favorite sexual norm . It' a 
touchy subject , to be sure, but 
presented in a playful and inof-
fensive manner. 

Not only are sexual stereo· 
types played upon, but so are 
traditional film styles. Wha-
tever your favorite genre, 
you're likely to find it trivial· 
ized, perverted, and ridiculed

Rocky Horror offers plenty 
of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll 
continued from page 14 
in the Rocky Horror Picture 
Show. There are spoofs on 
mu icals, biker movies, 
science fict ion films, and of 
course, the much imitated 
Frankenstein flick . 

Vaudeville is there too, 
along with lots of rock and roll . 
The kaleidoscope of connota-
tions and cliche interacting 
and revolving around each 
other creates a mirthful effect. 
The movie's main caricature, 
though, is of the musical. This 
is where the audience's fun 
change from passive to 
active. 

Rocky Horror fans love to 
ing along. It is not unusual to 

hear people sing along with 
every song and even dance 
when appropriate. orne call 

out responses to charact ers 
lines and actions. Others bring 
prop like rice and toast to 
throw at appropriate 
moments. The most popular 
activity is to dress up for the 
show. No, put your formal 

• 

mOVleS 
back in the closet. Experienced 
fans dress up as their favorite 
character, but even a Rocky 
Horror virgin can dress UD in 
anything crazy, fantastic, or, 
especially, lewd. 

Rocky Horror will be shown 
tonight in the gym. There will 
be a 9:30 show and one at the 
traditional midnight hour.

Star pitcher Uribe quits teatn 
Softball player feels "threatened" by coach, 
demands dismissal; rest of team stands by coach 

BY JOE FALLETTA 
Staff W riler 

Triton softball pitcher Rita Uribe is demand· 
ing the removal of coach Dan Monteverde 
because she feels physically threatened by him . 

According to Monteverde, Uribe's demand 
stems from a confrontation the two had during 
the Redlands Tournament March 12 and 13. 
Monteverde says Uribe "lambasted me and 
insulted me as a coach and as a person." At one 
point, he says he told Uribe, "If you were a guy, 
I'd deck you." 

He says he immediately realized what he said 
and ran after Uribe and apologized. 

" It was a stupid thin~ to say. I'm not tbat 
kind of person. I wouldn t have hit her even if 
she were a guy. It was said in a moment of 
frustration, of anger. 

"I knew my actions were wrong immediately; 

Women fall to USD 
as Polk's arm goes 

By JOE FALLETTA 
Senior Staff Writer 

The last half dozen or so games finally caught 
up with Triton oftball pitcher Dawn Polk yes-
terday as UCSD lost a heartbreaker to the Uni-
versity of San Diego, 8-6. 

"There's been a lot of pressure on Dawn," 
Monteverde said after the game. "She didn't 
hold up as well as she has in the past. he ' 
tired; she's pitched all our game (s ince star 
Rita Uribe left the team)." 

The young freshman who stepped in as UC' 
number-one hurler pitched her way oul of trou· 
ble in the first two frames, setting down USD 
scoreles with the bases jammed. UC's bat 
then came alive in the home third a s the Tritons 
scored five runs on four hits . 

Jan Martin led off the inning with a walk. 
Leigh Ann Layton advanced her to second with 
a well-placed sacrifice and lead-off batter Polk 
was hit by the pitch and took first . 

Vanessa Davis, Kuuipo Rossiter, Jill Keene 
andJulie Spatafore all teed off with solid hits off 
a USD starter named , ironically, Uribe - no 
relation to former Triton Rita. 

[t looked like the Dawn Polk s how from the 
third into the fifth as she set USD hitters down 
in order in the third and walked one in the 
fourth . 

In the fifth, Polk walked three and gave up 
two runs on one hit. Coach Dan Monteverde 

please turn to page 19 

I was wrong.! apologized and tried to correct the 
sit uation. We were both acting like a couple of 
high school kids. It was stupid," he said. 

The Guardian was unable to reach Uribe for 
comment by press time. 

Vanessa Davis, Triton catcher, says the rest 
of the team witnessed the outset of theconfron-
tat ion when, "we saw Rita verbally assault 
Dan ," but was told by Monteverde to go on 
ahead while he and Uribe talked. Davis says the 
team is " 100 percent behind Dan. 

"Rita thinks the team is behind her but she's 
wrong. She's had trouble gettin~alongwith the 
rest of the team. She wouldn t show up for 
practice or Casino Night (a team fund raiser). 
She wouldn ' t warm up with the team before a 
game." 

"The players don 't feel threatened ," Monte-
verde said. "I don't get that feeling from anyone 
el e on the team." 

He ay he felt the incident had been straight· 
ened out after he apologized to Uribe. 

"We were happy. It was high five after a big 
play, hand s haking." 

He says the " bombshell " was dropped on him 
two weeks later when Uribe went to him and 
told him s he was submitting a letter to Athletic 
Director Judith Sweet demanding Monteverde 
either re ign or be relea ed . If s he did not obtain 
action from Sweet , she would see the chancellor 
and then ee her lawyer, he ays . 

Monteverde says Uribe offered to play out the 
re tofthe ea on buthetold her she houldquit 
if she indeed felt threatened by him . 

" I as ked her, ' Do you really feel threatened by 
me now?' She aid, 'I felt that way then (at the 
tournament) but I don ' t feel that way now. 

''' I don ' t think it 's beyond the realm of po si· 
bilities, though,' s he said. At that point, I told 
her, if you really feel that way, you shouldn't 
play on the team. You can't play for a coach you 
feel threatened by." 

Monteverde termed the incident "the biggest 
coaching mi take of my life." 

He said he did not want to ee the incident 
become a "big is ue." 

"People go to court when they both ay, ' I 
don 't care; when both sides refuse to give in . I 
didn ' t say that. I apologized to her. She didn't 
apologize to me, but then I didn't expect any 
from her." 

He said he will not resign as coach nor will he 
let the matter upset hi s coaching. He aid he 
knows the mentality i not in him to phy ically 
threaten anyone. 

''I'll never be that kind of person. And if I 
re igned, I'd be admitting that 's my character."

This is thefirst in a series of articles exploring below·ihe·border, 
sporting activities which appwl to UCSD students who live 
their lives in pursuit of excitement, action and a good time 

BY BILL FISH 
S tall Writer 

" Racquetball ," deCIdes Bobby." you have to compare it 
to any other sport , it's probabl tlike racquetball." 

[n less than an hour, Tracy t Moore(or Bobby, as his 
name appears in the program), face a 150 mph blur. [t is 
something he does six days a week, 50 weeks a year. It IS a 
living. It is called jai alai. 

Commuting to Tijuana from hi home in Impenal Beach, 
Bobby takes the floor of -the 2000-seat fronton nearly every 
nigh t along with 30 fe llow ~/lJtart. Using a rock-hard rubber 
ball approximately the izeof a ba eball but three tIme a . 
heavy, the pelotari, or play , are armed WIth only helmet 
and ceslas. 

A cesla is a handmade, L- haped , basket·struct ured object , 
usually custom-made with a glove to fit the nght hand of the 
pelolari. (Due to the design of the court, the game is not 
s uited for left-handers). 

The goal of jai alai is to catch the ball, or pelota, with the 
cesta, then fling it against a wall in uch a manner that the 
bounce is impo ible for the opponent to handle. 

Players come in all shapes and ize . In a sport requmng 
both strength and agility, doub!es'team generally con 1 t of 
an agile front player an(f a bigger, stronger player 10 back. 
The more agile pewta,." usuaUy fare better mmgle ' 
competition. 

Knowledge of the individuals who compete ma~ he found 
in the evening program, which proves to be indL pen able to 
the gambling spectators. Although the game is exciting 10 
it elf, the sport, even at this pr()fessionallevel, would never 
con i tently attract fans were it not for the betting incen-
tive. As a spectator's sport, the real thrill of jai alai i. 
gambling. 

imilar to betting at the track , the ga mbler can opt for 
either a win, place or show bet. He al 0 may decide to try for a 
richer pot bv bettinIJ a quinela or an exacla. The maximum

wise better'Waitl for the odd to tabilize, knowing that the 
clock will be re-set at least three times. (The odds have a 
tedepcy toc~dramatically because of the relatively few 
Spect3tors). 

A the bell sounds and the fir t two team ' begin, (the 
teams are rotated in, Josers departing and winner gaining a 
point for each victory), fan cringe at the edge o f their eat·, 
shaking fi ts, jumping, yelling and drinking. Long rallies 
and great catche drive fan wild.

Crew Classic tops intercollegiate activities 
Crew 

BY DAN..BUTCHER.. 
Harvard, Purdue, UCLA, 

USC, Washington and Yale. 
Those are just a few of the 
schools participating in this 
Saturday's San Diego Crew 
Classic on Mis ion Bay. 

Since its inception in 1973, 
the Crew Classic has deve-
loped from an event with only 
nine schools participating to 
the country's premier, early 
season regatta. It is the only 
race of the year in which the 
western powers of the Pac' lO 
meet the mighty Ivy League 
schools of the east. This year's 
competition will feature 40 
teams competing in 37 events 
beginning at 7 a.m. The 
regatta will climax at 2:30 
with the featured Copley Cup, 
which may also be seen on 
ABC's Wide World of Sports. 

Thi year's main event will 
be of special intere t in San 
Diego because for the first 
time a local school, SDSU, has 
been invited to participate. 
Aztec Coach Doug Perez, pond· 
ering hi team's chance for 
victory, conceded that "we are 
just lucky to be there" and said 
that he will be content "to 
make a good howing and will 
be plea ed to make the final in 
that field." 

UCSD will have eight boats 
competing throughout the day 
which i the mo t any school 
has to offer. This reflects the 
depth of the Triton crew, the 
reason they are able to com· 
pete with the larger Division [ 
school. UCSD' entourage 
include the men 's heavy· 
weights rowing in the Califor· 
nia Cup at 7:50 and the 
defending national champion 
women's lightweigh t boat rac· 
ing at 11:20. 

The races will be run on the 
western part of the Bay adja·

volleyball team resumed prac·

NCAA Division I. Though the 
UCSD spikers lost. Dannevik 
expressed excitement as he 
envisioned tomorrow's sti ff 
competition . 

Presently, UCSD men are 
tied for econd in the Western 
Collegiate Volleyball Confer· 
ence with a record of 3·2. Over· 
all in NCAA standings they 
rank 5·8. 

Because of the nature of div· 
isions in men 's volleyball, com· 
peting at the high·ca liber 
Division I level and the 
obvious disadvantages of the 
"short" team (6 '2" being the 
tallest player), Dannevik's 
goals are accenting play with a 
positive, casual attitude - not 
s tressi ng win· loss s tati tics. 
The focu s is upon qualifying 
for league tournaments rather 
than uverall standings. 

UCSD spikers will greet 
nationally ranked top ten 
teams Pepperdine, SDSU and 
UCLA this coming month on 
home courts. 

Track 
BY THOMAS SCHMIDT 
Saturday April 3, the UCSD 

Track Team will play ho t to 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
USIU, Chapman College and 
the San Diego Track Club, in 
what promises to be a tightly 
fought track meet. The field 
events will begin at noon with 
the running events starting at 
1:25 p.m. 

UCSD track coach Andy 
Skief, when asked about his 
team' s chances, asserted that 
"USIU is the strongest team in 
the meet, but I think we can 
use our depth in the middle dis· 
tances and the field events, 
and possibly win the meet. " 

The men' s and women's 
team have both los t runners 
to the academic pressures Of 
"our demanding university."

Thursday, April I, 1982 The UCSD Guardian 19 

Freshman Dawn Polk, the new Triton pitcher pitched well on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, but the s train of being a one- woman 
staff is telling. The Tritons lost to Point Lorna 4-0 on Tuesday, 
and USD 8-6 Wednesday in game played on Warren Campus 
field. 

usn wins 
continued (rom page 17 
switched Polk with catcher 
Vanessa Davis in the s ixth 
after Polk allowed two runs on 
one hit and four walks. Davis 
allowed four runs and struck 
out two in the s ixth and 
eventh. 

Monteverde noted the team 
played well. The Tritons seem 
always to draw from a 
bottomless well of heart and 
spi rit a , after going from five 
up on Division I USD to three 
down in the seventh, they 
came back fighting, scoring 
one on a si ngle by Polk and a 
screaming triple to center by 
Davis. 

That one cou ld have rolled 
until tomorrow but for the 
thick grass at Warren Field, 
Monteverde noted. " In a 
number of other parks. it 
would have been a round· 
tripper," he said. 

"I've never seen a more 
tremendous effort by a player 
than Vanessa 's," he said. 
Davi s played well behind the 
plate to save a number of wi ld 
throws, pitched, and clouted a 
double and a triple in the 
effort. 

A couple of fielding gems by 
USD infielder robbed Polk 
and right fielder Layton of 
extra bases and the home team 
of victory. 

So it goes. 
"If you play well and win, 

you deserve it." Monteverde 
said. " If you play well and lose,-
it's tough luck." 

The player were up after 
the game. "It's a ~itive sign, 
they never quit,' Monteverde 
said . " I loved seeing it." 

Captain's meetings 
BY LARRY GOLDMAN 

StaU Writer 
Once again it i spri ngtime, and you know what that mean . 

According to colt Berndes, il,tramural co-director, springtime 
brings "the intramural quarter which IS the most fun of all 
tntramural quarters." 

Sports offered in the spri ng are more "laid back" and oCial 
The refs don 't get yelled at as much and, although there i" 
competition, there is congeniality too. 

The mo t popular springtime sport is softball. Softball is 
offered in women", men's, and coed diviSIOns. The captaIns' 
meetings for softball are on Thursday, April 1: women's is at 3 
p.m., coed at 4 p.m., and men's at 5 p.m. 

The mo t popular indoor spring sport is volleyball. The volley· 
ball captains' meetings are on Friday, April 2. The women's 
meeting is at 4 p.m. and the men' is at 5 p.m. On Monday, April 5 
at 4 p.m., is the captain's meeting for team badminton, and at 5 
p.m. is the meeting for innertube waterpolo 

Finally on Tuesday, April 6, men's and women's Ultimate 
Frisbee have their meeting at 4 p.m. 

Since the sports offered are leisure·t lme sports, spring in tram· 
urals promote comraderie just as much as competItion. 

Other intramural events to look for this quarter are the all· 
campus badminton tournament. the collegiate Over· the LIne 
tournament. the AlI·Campus Track and Field games, and the 
All ·Ca l Intramural Sports Festival. 

Attention writers! 
Like ports? Do you want to write for Gllardla1l port? Do you 

already write for Guardtan sports? Well then pay attention 
Tuesday, April6. at the very convenient (for me) timeofll a .m .. 
a sports·writer staff meeting will be held . This is for ALL staff 
sports reporters. We will di cu new assignments, new and old 
policie , feature, and exciting way to make the. port ectlOn 
SEXier and more entertaining. Thi meeting IS 
MANDATORY. If this a.m. hour is too strange for some of you, 
(yeah I know what some of you do at night), or you actually plan 
to attend a cia at this time, call Tim Pickwell at 452·3466. 
Again, all new writer are also welcome at this meeting whIch , 
god·willing, will be brief.

Bobby. who 'eems to have 
established himself as a crowd 
favorite in only one year as a 
pro, feels the pressure. "Any 
time you have someone bet on 
you," he says, "there's going to 
be a lot of pressure." 

Being one of the few Ameri-
can pelotari, Bobby was born 
and learned to play jai alai in 
Florida, an area where the 
sport is mo t popular in the 
US. He believes only 15-18 
Ironlons exist as part of the 
enormous MGM Grand 
complex . 

Another American. Miguel 
Arteaga . (he i actually half-
Basque), attends Southwest-
ern University. His powerful 
handshake verifies his pro-
fe sion . His right forearm is 
built like a lead pipe from years 
of training and playing. 

"Training," explains Xavier 
Arregue through an inter· 
preter. "consists of three years 
of daily practice." Arregue. a 
former player himself. serves 
as the referee and coach. He i 
the inlendente, who originally 
became interested in the game 
because of an uncle who 
played professionally. Only re-
cently retired as an active com-
petitor, Arregue claim that jai 
alai careers generally span 
about 15 years. 

Bobby is just beginning his 
career. Whereas in Basque 
countries jai alai ha been 
played for centuries. repre-

it is considered an honor to be

UCSD drugs 
out a win 

By GUNAR SVIKA 
Swedis h Correspondent 

In a surprise upset victory 
over the University of West 
Virginia, the UCSD Drug team 
garnered the national cham-
pionship in the NCAA Drug 
finals in Berkeley yesterday. 

UCSD scored a near perfect 
296.4 points (out of a possible 
3(0) in the compu lsory rounds 
of paraphernalia repair and 
s ubstance sorting. In the free 
routine, the four member 
team, composed of captain 
Dirk " Shroomo" Levens, 
Eddie " Addict" Bilger, Dave 
"THC" Kirker and Walter 
"Burnout" Siegel, shroomed 
out under black lights to the 

prepared statement , explained 
th e move at a morni ng press 
conference. 

" We decided to reinstate the 
sport of football (UCSD last 
had a team in 1969) after initial 
prompting from alumni and 
the chancellor 's office. The 
need for a team definitely 
exists. The university can 
only benefit from the 
recognition that a high-caliber 
football program will 
generate. " 

Sweet went on to assure the 
gathered coac hes t ha t no 
sports would be cut to make 
room for football. 

"One of the attractions of 
the program," she told them, 
" is that it will not cost the 
Intercollegia te Department 
any money. Alumni and the 
chancellor 's di scretionar y 
fund should cover every-
thing." 

The athletic director gave 
the program her whole -
hearted endorsement. 

" I have been assured by 
Clyde (new Head Coa-:h Clyde 
Slively) that his team will be 
one to be proud of. He has 
promised us a winner in his 
first season, and a national 
championship in the very near 
future. " 

" It will be exciting to play 
teams like USC, Oklahoma 
and Notre Dame. I foresee a 
great rivairy developing 
between UCSD and San Diego 
State." 

New Triton head football coach Clyde Slively and four of his top recruits. SJively refused to 
release the names of the players but claims " there's plent y more where these guy,; come 
from." He also boasts, "No other college coach thought to recruit these guys." 

Defected Yugoslav play ballfor UCSD 
Women's Basketball Coach 

Jud y Malone has announced a 
recruiting coup. She has 
signed Yugoslavian national 
star Lydshilla Blokova to a 
four year scholarship. 

Blokova defected from 
Yugo lavia two months ago in 
a harrowing journey through 
the s now-bound Bulgarian 
Alps. After seeking asylum in 
Italy, Blokova traveled to the 
United States, where she met 
Malone. 

Maione, coming off a 9-i6 
eason, was ec tatic over the 

acquisition of the 7'2" center. 

"Lydshy's one of the 
greatest player in the world," 
the coach explained. "And 
even though she is 27, she still 
has four years of college 
eligibi li ty." 

Malone plans to redesign her 
offense to accomodate the 
high-post scoring threat. 

"We will still use Pauletee 
(guard Paulette Parker) as an 
outside scoring threat , but 
everyone else will concentrate 
on getting the ball to Lyd hy." 

After seeing Blokova play, 
Malone i convmced that once 
he gets the ball. "she IS 

unstoppable from five feet 
out. " 

Blokova is al a a deft pas er 
and the coach hope to utilize 
her rebounding and passing 
skills to install a ta t break 

"With her reboundmg, the 
other girls can relea e up-court 
and we will be able to run 
more. She ha uncanny 
accuracy on her outlet 
pa ses."

for the last six years, was elim-
inated from the competition 
when, during their free rou-
tine of free basing, the ent ire 
team caught fire and disap-
peared running out of the 
sports facility. 

Said Levens on UCSD's 
im pressive victory, "The four 
of us have trained so hard for 
this. We never would have 
made it without the aid of the 
Chem Stockroom staff in USB, 
or the guidance given us by 
certain administrators in the 
Chancellor' s complex ." 

In the individual competi-
tion held Tuesday , Walter Sie-
gel took second place for his 
attempt to ingest more smack 
than has ever been success-
fully consumed. He recovered 
from his coma early yesterday 
morning in time for the team 
events. 

The team will fly home from 
Berkeley tonight without the 
aid of a plane.

After the second consecutive 

week of negotiations, sports-
caster Ted Leitner is sti ll a hol-
dout from the Channel 8 News 
Team's off-season. The train-
ing camp, located in Newhall , 
California , has been going 
about business as usual 
throughout the ordeal. 

Leitner's demands before 
returning to the lineup are a 
follows: 1) To change t he title 
to Ted Leitner's "Let's talk 'til 
I'm blue in the face" show; 2) 
45 minutes of sports commen-
tary and the remaining 15 min-
utes to be divided between 
news and commercials; 3) 
Instead of interviewi ng semi-
retired football player from 
the Chargers, Ted want s to 
interview himself at least 
twice a week; 4) To continue to 
wear more s illy clothing with-
out any flack from the front 
off ice; 5) And finally, a $20,000 
pay raise to move his belong-
ings out of Horton Plaza into a 
better residence. 

Without Leitner. Channel 8 
s till looks s t rong forthe season 
and hopes to replace Ted with 
a " ... more colorful and intelli-
gent sports program that 
doesn 't make s tupid com-
ments while on the air," a bul-
letin from the news station 
stated . 

Vet era n broadca s ter 
Michael Tuck, co-a nchor , has 
been t he team 's spokesman 
and silent leader from thc 
beginning. '" think Ted is 

really tryi ng to make a move 
toward the better life with 
more class and prest ige," 
Tuck said. An unidentified 
caller to the UCSD Guardian 
confirmed Tuck' s analysis 
yesterday by claiming to have 
sold his two-car garage in La 
Jolla to the portscaster. 

Leitner is being represented 
by two West Coast sports 
agents , Tony De Marco and 
Howard Slusher. "The s itua-
tion has gotten quite out of 
hand ," an interpreter for De 
Marco said today. "Ted really

when he idolized Howard 
Cosell during a recent tele-
cast, " De Marco' continued . 
"How (Slusher) and I can' t get 
Ted to back down on his insist-
ence of having a gold micro-
phone while the others have to 
shout the news." 

For the remaining crew in 
Newhall , the camp has been 
quieter without Leitner. Two-
a-days are finally over and the 
team begins its rigorous make-
up training on Friday. Allison 
Ross, the ot her half of the co-
anchor, has refused to peak to 
reporters for fear of being mis-
quoted . All question and 
answers must be written on 
cue-card for Ro to answer. 
When asked about her feelings 
for Ted ' campaign , he wrott' 
back, "no coment (sic)." 

A poll recently conducted by 
the Guardian showed that 
only one out of 15 people inter-
viewed upported Ted, and the 

bartender threw her out 
immediately.

out or will Channel 4 gi\'e him

AS votes last $1,000 to buy 
second electric golf cart 

By GUSTAV FLAUBERT 
Staph Germ 

The A sociated Students 
Council 'voted last night toallo-
cate nearly $2,000 tu the pur· 
chase of an elect ric golf cart. 
bringing the total A fleet to 
four . 

Because the A only has 
$1,000 remaining in its gen-
eral. unallocated fund, it will 
have to dip into "frozen" 
monies previously allocated to 
student organizations. 

" It looks as though K, DT 
will be the victim, in funding 
. ource for our little project." 
according to A President 
Jule Bagneri '. ''I'm sure they 
have no use for the $10,000 we 
reappropriated them last year 
- r mean , what' $lO,OOO?" 

During council debate, A 

Commissioner of tudent Wrl-
fare Reggie Williams brought 
up the point that the KSDT 
funds will not last forever, and 
that other source:, of "emf:!-
gen y" fundmg will have to be 
found. 

To this Bagn ris responded: 
"Well, we'll ju t find a couple 
of other tudent orgs with big 
allocations and slap a freeze on 
them. Naturally, though, we 
wou ld have to have a good rea-
on to do this. Let me think 

about it. " 
Debate on the issue mainlv 

focused on the quest ions of 
alternate funding sources for 
the A , now that they have 
exhausted the nearly $200,000 
in activity fees available to 
them at the beginning of th 
academic year. Little discus-

sion \\ as held (Ill t hl' act ual 
need for anot her cart to he 
addf j to I h A: f\e'~t. 

After the meet in.\{, however 
Bagnens. \\ ho has had ample 
practice driving the existmg 
fleet around campus. said that 
the additions of thl' new cart 
will alleviate the conflict 
between him and another 
unnamed council member, 
who constantly fIght over use 
of the cart. 

"At the present tIme. we 
seem to have a problem with 
cart time use allocation," Bag-
neris said "The head of one of 
th campus'. leftist newspap-
ers alway has ~ome 'good' rea-
son for using the cart. 

"But r always 'have a better 
reason," BagnerL smiled. 

Regents outline huge cuts 
The UC Board of Regents 

announced last week that it 
will have to shut down two of 
it nine campu. es next year in 
order to maintain total opera-
tion at a reasonable level. 

"We must make the unfort 11 -
nate decision in order Lo pre-
serve the academic integriLy of 
the entire sy tern," UC Presi -
dent David Saxon told the 
board. 

The anta Cruz and River-
side campuse are the most 
likely candidate, for next 
yea r s s hutdown , although 
Irvine and an Diego are also 
under con ideration. A final 
decision on the matter will be 
made at the Regent" May 

meeting. 
In the meantime, a speCIal 

committee of administratIOn. 
students and facultv will 
inve. tigate alternatives to 
closing down two campuses 
outright. 

One plan now under consid-
erat ion is Lo "give" the anta 
Cruz campus to the California 

taLe University system. "We 
would rea lly hate to do that," 
said one unidentified adminis-
trator, "but we r ally think 
is the best because so little 
transition would be neces-
sary.' Another systemwide 
analyst suggested that the Riv-
erside campus he s hut down 
"because it 's in I he middle of 

the de ert - and who want· to 
go to school in the middleof t he 
desert?" UCR is also being con-
sidered because it is estimated 
that building deterioration due 
to high smog levels in the \. ic-
inity wl1l render the campus 
unusuable in less than ten 
years. 

Although lTC D IS on the 
alternate list for considera 
tion, axon told reporters after 
the board meet ing t hat there is 
little chance that the La Jolla 
campus would be closed down. 
"We'd be foolish to shut down 
a campu_ t hat sen es as such a 
marvelous retirement ground 
for ,vorn oul professors and 
administrators - like me."

Stuff that Came in the Mail 

The urge 
to regurge 
Editor: 

There i something that has 
really been bothering me the 
last couple of days. I am a 
Revelle College tudent and I 
cat regularly in the Revelle 
Cafeteria. 

When I returned from vaca-
tion on Monday, I noticed that 
they were installing a new con-
veyer belt to take our trays 
back into the di hroom_ Now 
I'm all for progress and the 
modern conveniences, but do 
we really need a new conveyor 
belt? 

I tlink this wouldn't bother 
me 0 much if there hadn't 
been other apparently useless 
expenditures made in the 
cafeteria, such as a cute nutri -
tion newsletter and a bunch of 

indoor plants . The. e thing 
are ni~e, but they 're hardly 
e sentlal. And during this 
time, the food ha. not gotten 
better. 

With dorm costs ri ing 
about 30 percent next year, I 
find it incredibly nervy of the 
cafeteria administration to 
make the unnecessary expen-
ditures. Perhap if they would 
ju t cut the superflou niceties 
and cook good food, things 
would be a lot better.

An Obtuse Angle 

What America means to me 
BY MIKE AHN 

taff Writ er 
In the year 1967, when I was 

young and living in a place 
where starving native eat dog 
and there i ju t one Dairy 
Queen on the whole island, my 
father, who was then a bass 
player for Deep Purple, used to 
sing a lullabye to me, usually 
during lunch, and it went 
nothing like this: 

Oh ay can you see 
Warmonging imperialist 
death bringers 
The golden evil 
Brought by your pia tic Santa 
Clauses 
And your ugly love eats 

And your Howard Cosells? 
Die, die, dogs disguised as 
State Farm In urance 
salesmen 
'Cause you better not pout, 
you bet ter not cry, 
You better not hout , I'm tell-
ing you why, 
Ho Chi Minh is coming to 
town . 

That's not what America 
means to me. 

America! The mere mention 
of the land brings joyous flecks 
of pitt Ie to my lips, pictures of 
warm sunny days, s inging 
dockworker , good wine ... No, 
that' France. 

To understand what Amer-

ica means to me, you must 
Ii ten totheRollingStones' Lei 
It Bleed album backward. at 
45 RPM . But there is an easier 
way to find it. 

Visit a used car lot and mar-
vel at the variety. The freedom 
of choice! When I first saw 
those old Buicks, Dodge and 
Chryslers in the bright shiny 
sun, ten gallon tears began 
pouring down my roly-poly 
face . It is truly a blessing to be 
allowed to buy any car you'd 
like - Toyotas, Plymouths, 
Volkswagens, yes, even Fords! 
In other not-50-free countries 
the proletariat is forced to buy 
Chevy Novas or die resi ting.

Mushrooms make it in the Magic Kingdom 
By ANGELO ROUNDTREE 

Foreign Correspondent 
Hey, finals were over and I 

was ready to party. What bet-
ter place to take a break than 
America's playground, Dis-
neyland. The first duty was to 
ecure mass Quantities of 

mus hrooms to insure our trip 
to the Magic Kingdom would 
be enjoyable. 

After this feat was accomp-
lis hed , my friends and I loaded 
into the covered wagon and 
headed north . When we 
arrived in Parkinglotland , we 
donated our change to the 
money-sucking attendant, and 
we were in. It was apparent 
that in reality, Disneyland is 
Greenland (as in "that'll be 
$25, ir."). 

Once we paid at the front 
gate, things began to get 
weird, and my recollection of 
the fo llowing events is very 
sketchy. We went to Tommo-
rowland first (or was it Yester-
dayland last?). The mo t 
futuristic thing there is the 
food prices. They sell yester-
day' burgers at tomorrow's 
prices and call it progress. 

Space Mountain was our 
next stop. This is the ultimate 
10 thrills and spills. If the 

pace huttle is like this, s ign 
me up, although thiS waiting 
line stuff has to go. After two 
minutes of cruising through 
the galaxy in every pos ition 
known to man, your equili -
bnum is totally screwed up; 
and when you're on mush-
rooms , this is not a pretty 
sight. I really didn 't mean to 
throw up on that Chinese 
family . . 

We th n made a dash to the 
Autopia ride, where you're 
promised to get the "real" feel -
ing of driving. What a joke! 
The cars don ' t even have 
brakes. I'm sure (' gave that 

10 year-old boy whipla h, but 
we weren't about to stick 
around and wait for the X-
rays. I ure didn't want to be 
dragged away to ecurityland. 
I paid good money, and I 
wasn't about to spend all day 
in the Mouse House. 

A good hiding place eemed 
to be the "America the Beauti-
ful" exhibit. This was a 
freak's paradise: two Queaky-
clean employees delivered a 
nau eating speech on the 
many attributes of the Bell 
System. Fools from all walks 
of life were eating this garbage 
up. Everywhere in the park is 
Commercialand; whether 
you're at the Wonder Bread 
Country Bear Jamboree, or 
listening to healthy dosages of 
Goodyear propaganda, you 
can't escape it. 

We must have made a wrong 
turn at Fantasyland and ended 
up in Uglyland. When your 
reality has been a ltered, it is 
not fair to your nervou s sys-
tem to be exposed to this. We 
ran like hell, and s nu ck into 
the Pirates of the Caribbean. 
When I looked a t the thing si t-
ting next to my friend , I just 
freaked . It was at that ins tant I 
realized the people on the rides 
were more frightening than 
the actual rides . 

At every attraction they 
check for your coupon, but J 
wa totally convinced they 
were checking for green (immi-
gration) cards. I thought I 
would get a reward when I cor-
ralled a Mexican family , but 
when they kept kicking and 
creaming, a group of urity 

guards dressed as Huey, 
Dewey, and Louie came charg-
ing at me. I did the on ly thing 
that came to mind: I climbed 
the Swiss Family Robinson 
Treehouse and held an Idaho 

businessman and hi wife 
hostage. 

A while later, I 'ettled down 
and was headed for Big 
Thunder Mountain, when I 
spotted two Canadian girl. 
who were lost and needed 
assistance. I guided them to 
Ecs ta yland and ... (good taste 
and a bad memory prevent me 
from continuing). 

I finally caught up with my 

friends, who were about to get 
in a fight with a bu load of 
Shriners who they thought 
had taken cuts in line at Mr. 
Toad's Wild Ride. Things were 
getting too weird. 

Donald Duck was dishing 
out Quaaludes to mothers who 
were having trouble managing 
their brats, Mickey Mouse was 
partying on Tom Sawyer 
Is lantl with som refugees 

from "It' a mall World," and 
God knows what Goofy and 
Snow White were doing in the 
teacup. 

When things are at the 
s trangest, it 's time to head for 
the Haunted House. Once 
again, we had to wait in Line-
land , but once inside, it wa a 
blast. The ability to throw 
your voice in a crowded room 
is such a valuable tool. A well 

placed insult here, an obscen-
ity there, and the next thing 
you know, you havea full -scale 
brawl. 

I could have wornoneofthe 
talking figures in the house 
was my late Uncle George, but 
every time I got out to talk to 
him , the employees grabbed 
me and repeated "please keep 
your arms and I~s inside the 
ride at all times. ' 

It was getting pretty late, so 
we decided to take the Di ney-
land Train around the park. 
After an enjoyable few min-
ute ', an old man in an overcoat 
with a big briefcase and 
Arthur Bremmer su nglasse 
came aboard. We were sure he 
wa going to hijack the train ; 
he had "Cuba" written all over 
him. Needless to say, we didn 't 
give him the chance. We cou ld 
barely hear his cream as he 
tumbled down the hill into 
Bear Country. 

We jumped off at Frontier-
land, but we were too late for 
happy hour at the Mile Long 
Bar, so we decided to head for 
Homeland . We cruised down 
Mainstreet, there was a hot 
flick playing at the Mainstreet 
Cinema (somet hing about 
some midgets or dwarves or 
something), and the Palace 
Arcade was happening. Par-
ents watched disgusting one-
cent movie , and kids played 
video games. (I don 't know 
about you, but my idea of a 
good time is to come 3,000 
miles to play Pac-Man). 

Enough was enougn; we 
made it back to Parkinglotland 
and took off. I wa glad we 
were leaving Freakland, even 
though I rather enjoyed my 
stay. The only regret I have is 
that I didn t get to meet 
Annette Funicello. I was going 
to take her to the Bondage ride 
in S & Mland. 

I think next break I'm going 
to Adultland. It is somewhere 
in Nevada and the rides are 
real and the pa:-k never closes. 
Well, that's how I spent my 
vacation, I think. Orwas it in a 
bar in Tijuana ....
