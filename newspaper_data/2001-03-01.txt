MOSCOW - The domestic

The arrest of the student, John

Cannabis Study Proposals Approved 
UCSD center is almost ready to use medicinal marijuana 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD-based Center for Medicinal 
Cannabis Research announced the approval 
of its first proposals for the study of cannabis 
as a treatment for specific medical conditions. 

The studies selected include an inpatient 
study on the effects of smoking marijuana to 
alleviate peripheral nm-e pain associated with 
HIV infection; an outpatient study of the effects 
and safety of smoked marijuana versus a place-
bo for the treatment of muscle spasms, loss of 
function, and related pain in patients with mul-
tiple sclerosis; and an outpatient study on the 
acute and long-term effects of repeated admin-
istration of medical cannabis on driving ability. 

CMCR Director Igor Grant described the 
process by which 13 proposals were narrowed 
to four. 

MWe have followed a careful process of 
protocol review, engaging senior scientists 
from around the country on our scientific 
review board to evaluate proposals and rec-

ommend funding for those that meet our 
high scientific standards, within the strict 
procedures established by Health and Human 
Services, the DEA and the FDA: Grant said. 

The CMCR is a state-funded collaboration 
between UCSD and UCSF. It was established 
last year as a result of a bill sponsored by state 
Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara, and 
signed into law by Gov. Gray Davis in 
October 1999. The law provided for $3 mil-
lion in state funds for the center. Additional 
federal funding may come later. 

California voters approved the use of med-
ical marijuana in 1996, but the guideUnes for 
administering cannabis are ambIguous. 
Vasconcellos' legislation called for a three-year 
program of high-quality medical research. 

MThese approved studies will begin to 
gather evid~e to determine whether or not 
marijuana is effective as a medical treatment 
for certain conditions,W Vasconcellos said. 

It is anticipated that additional studies will 
be reviewed and approved to begin in late 
spring 2001 .

Scripps Discovers New Meteorite Source 
A study conducted by researchers at the 

Scripps Institution of Oceanography has 
revealed that the Orguell meteorite, which fell to 
earth in France in 1864, is the first meteorite 
that can be traced to a comet rather than an 
asteroid. Asteroids are commonly believed to be 
the source of all meteorites. The new informa-
tion about the Orguell meteorite may lead to an 
increased understanding of the origin of llfe on 
earth. 

The researchers state in their findings, which 
were published in the Feb. 27 issue of the 
"Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences," that the meteorite may contain the 
components necessary to generate life on earth, 
The amino acids found in the object are the 
source of what the researchers say may have 
created life. 

The meteorite had, however, been studied 
previously. Jeffrey Bada, a professor of marine 
chemistry at Scripps, and his colleagues used 
new technology to study the small amounts of 
amino acids In the object. The new evidence 
comes from this more sophisticated approach to 
looking at the meteorite, 

UCSD School "of Medicine 
Hosts 'Mitochondria 2001' 

The UCSD School of Medicine, the 
Mitochondrial Medicine Society, the 
Mitochondria Research Society and the United 
Mitochondrial Disease Foundation are currently 
hosting a conference titled "M itochondrla 
2001," a forum Intended to draw attention and 
look for solutions to the problems created by 
malfunctioning mitochondria in the human cells, 
The forum started yesterday and will conclude 
on March 4. 

Mitochondria are responsible for converting 
food Into energy inside cells, and doctors, 
researchers and patients are realizing the dan-
gerous repercussions of the malfunctioning mitt>-

chondrla, which can lead to organ failure and 
cell injury. 

At the conference. which is being held at the 
Hyatt Regency Islandia, researchers and physiÂ· 
cians intend to make a plan to bring before the 
National Center for Health Statistics in Maryland 
in an attempt to get the disease an internation-
al classification of disease code, which would 
recognize the health problem, since it is an 
emerging field of diSCipline.

Chavez: 
Essay contest wirmers will read 
their wurk at Chavez breakfast 
ConIInued from .... 1 
"Remembering Cesar" panel discussion and 
the Cesar E. Chavez Humanitarian Awards, 
to be given out at the Barrio Station Annual 
Dinner . 

According to American Indian Academic 
Outreach Coordinator Mark Chavez, UCSD 
is sponsoring many of its own events to 
commemorate the civic leader. 

Beginning April 2 with a showing of 
"Fight in the Fields" at the Price Center 
Theater, UCSD will show a movie on 
Chavez and his cause every Monday. Also, 
members of the UCSD community will be 
participating in a Cesar Chavez commemo-
rative walk from the corner of Euclid and 
Logan streets to Cesar Chavez Elementary 
School. The walk will take place March 31 
at 9 a.m. 

Mark Chavez said he was proud that 
"UCSD is taking the initiative to have the 
essay contest." 

Still, he urged further involvement of the 
university in the celebration of the political 
1eader's life and struggle . 

"We need to make more of an attempt to 
be a leader in community activities of this 
type,",Mark Chavez said. "We want to set a 
precedent for the future and develop a com-
mitment from the university as a whole. We

Awareness Week: body image. 

"Help on the Way: Female Athlete Thad" 
is another pamphlet available. The "Female 
Athlete Triad" is a combination of three dis-
orders: disordered eating, lack of menstrual 
periods and bone weekening. Active 
women, including college athletes, are at 
risk for this. The pamphlet includes infor-
mation about the signs and risks of Female 
Athlete Triad, as well as prevention tips. 

College students are often at high risk for 
eating disorders because of all the changes 
they experience. Kurata named some of the 
factors, such as being away from home for 
the first time, having to select their own 
meals in the dining halls, and the weight lim-
its that some sports teams impose. 

initiated it this year, and hopefully we'll be 
even more involved next year." 

As part of the holiday celebration, 
UCSD, in partnership with the San Diego 
Cesar Chavez Committee, is sponsoring an 
essay contest dedicated to celebrating the 
life and achievements of Chavez. 

The contest is open to students from 
grades seven through 12 and challenges 
contestants to comment on the influence 
Chavez and his work have had, or might 
have, on their lives and futures. 

Members of the San Diego Cesar E. 
Chavez Commemoration Committee, as 
well as representatives from the UCSD fac-
ulty, staff and student body, will judge the 
essays on their originality, historic content 
and expression of personal viewpoints. 

Of the contestants, three grand-prize 
winners will win a new computer. Second-, 
third- and fourth-place winners will each 
receive $750, $500 and $250 savings bonds, 
respectively, to be put toward paying for col-
lege. Certificates of honorable mention will 
be awarded to participants in each ofthe five 
regions serviced by UCSD's Early Academic 
Outreach Program. 

Winning authors will be invited to read 
their essays at the Third Annual Cesar E. 
Chavez Breakfast March 30 at the San 
Diego Convention Center. Winners of the 
essay contest will also be featured April 7 
at the Marshall College Cultural 
Celebration at UCSD, as well as at other 
community events commemorating the 
lIfe of Chavez. 

Berkeley: 
Insufficient aid may be due to 
increased living costs 
CoIItInIIecI from ..... 1 
that the aid system cannot handle. 

According to Richard Black, the UC 
Berkeley director of financial aid, low-
income students who do not receive aid 
- dubbed "un-met need" students -
must work full -time, part-time or borrow 
money to attend college, sometimes 
inhibiting access to universities. 

"We do meet full needs with a combi-
nation of loans, grants and work for all 
California residents: he said. "We will 
continue to do so. I am concerned, how-
ever, with self-help expectations that are at 
$6 ,400. With rigorous help, we will be able 
to reduce expectations." 

Officials said the problem of insuffi-
cient aid is partly caused by the increase of 
living costs and the lack of expansion 
among aid progra!lls. 

Students being treated for eating disor-
ders at Student Health Services see a combi-
nation of three people to aid their recovery:

cannot remember a time when there was no 
Winterrest, it is a relatively new tradition; the 
first one was held in 1998. Certain factors, 
however, have forced the Guardian to consid-
er whether we should continue to devote 
funds and resources to the annual event. 

Although we applaud the A.S. Council for 
coming up with new and interesting ways to 
better student life, the rising prices charged by 
bands have made having three spectacular 
festivals per year virtually impossible. It is the 
position of the Guardian that UCSD should 
drop Winterrest and divert the money that 
goes into it toward bettering the Sun God and 
Fallfest concerts. 

Last year, many students were disappoint-
ed with the band choices for Sun God. This 
was mostly a result of the lack of funding to 
pay for better bands. The A.S. Council even 
had to struggle to get the bands they did. 

The budget for each of the three festivals 
rises every year, but the amount of money 
bands demand is rising at a faster rate. When 
bigger bands such as Weezer come to our 
school, it is often because their concerts are 
put on by off-campus promoters. It is a finan-
cial issue: The A.S. Council simply cannot 
currently afford to pay for such bands to play 
at three festivals every year. 

It would be better to have two great festi-
vals with quality, bigger-name bands that 
everyone enjoys rather than to have three 
mediocre festivals. 

The festival to can is clearly Winteriest. 
Sun God is here to stay. Fallfest, though 
somewhat small now, has the potential to be 
much better with more funding. It is at the 
beginning of the school year, it is welcoming 
to incoming freshmen and the weather is 
generally still nice. 

Winterrest shows up at the pinnacle of stu-
dent apathy: the middle of winter quarter. 
The weather is often poor and students are 
preoccupied with schoolwork. Unless the 
band lineup for Winterrest is amazing, stu-
dents will not take to it as much as they 
would the other two festivals. 

The Guardian is always interested in ma~;Â­
ing campus life as fun as possible. A.lthough it 
may seem strange that we would take a posi-
tion advocating getting rid of a major campus 
festival, we think having well-funded, more 
exciting Sun Gods and Fallfests would be bet-
ter for students overall .

Latest WashirigtoD: Fiasco Reeks of 
Corruption and Unethical Behavior 

By RYAN DARBY 
Staff Writer 

Bill, B.ill, Bill. What were you think-
ing? 

For a president who claimed toÂ·be so 
mindful of his place in history, you sure 
have done some stupid things. 

Sure, you convinced the American 
people to tum a blind eye when you per-
jured yourself. But how stupid do you 
think we are? 

Now that you're out of office, nothing 
protects you from the consequences of 
your shady dealings that began in the 
hours before your departure. 

Clinton's corruption is more obvious 
now than ever. The most controversial 
example so far is his pardon of billionaire 
fugitive Marc Rich, who fled to Switzer-
land in 1983 upon indictment on counts 
of $48 million in tax evasion, fraud and 
illegal oil deals with Iran. 

While Rich's evasion of a fair trial 
should be the first indication of his guilt, 
Clinton undermined the Department of 
justice's pleas and pardoned the fugitive. 

Why would Clinton pardon him, espe-
cially after experts on the case had begged 
him not to? This is where we see how 
crooked "Slick WillyÂ· really is. Rich's ex-
wife had allegedly donated more than Â·$l 
million to Clinton and other Democrats 
over the last eight years, including 
$450,000 directly to Clinton's library 
foundation in Little Rock. 

So after receiving over a million dol-
lars from his wife, Clinton just happened 
to pardon Rich. Small world, huh? 

It appears another reason for Rich 's 
pardon was to please prominent Israeli 
officials, including former Prime Minis-
ter Ehud Barak, who claim that Rich has 
donated over $80 million to the coun-
try's various charities and helped evacu-
ate its citizens from Yemen and Ethiopia. 

Well now, Clinton has satisfied two 

major constituents with one pardon. 
Very impressive. Regardless of how clever 

. a politician he thinks he is, this blatantly 
shady dealing is being investigated by 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and the FBI. 

Apparently it isn't enough for Clinton 
to appease his constituents; he also has 
to appease his wife. Perhaps this is a 
peace offering to help make up for 
"Monicagate: 

It has recently been discovered that 
two 6f the men Clinton pardoned, Glenn 

Clinton's corruption is more 
obvious now than ever , .. Of 
the 140 individuals he 
pardoned, the Department 
of Justice had recommended 
that 40 remain behind 
bars ... 
Braswell and Carlos Vignali, were repre" 
sented by Hugh Rodham, the brother of 
former first lady Sen. Hillary Rodham 
Clinton . Once again, small world, huh? 

Rodham was paid over S4OO,OOO for 
his services, most of which has been 
returned for obvious reasons. Based upon 
the Clinton's track record, this display of 
cronyism is hardly surprising; They claim 
to have only recently discovered that the 
applicants were represented by Rodham. 
Right, and young Bill didn't inhale. This 
little mishap is being investigated by a very 
angry Senate Judiciary Committee. 

Let's not forget about Hillary's bid for 
Senate. After all, she's so disliked that it 
would be difficult for her to win any pub-
lic office without bending a few rules. 

To grease the rails for her, hubby ex-
President Clinton commuted the sen-
tences of Kalmen Stem, David Gold-
stein, Benjamin Berger and Jacob 

Elbaum, who were convict~d of stealing 
over $40 million from the federal gov-
ernment. Petty offense, right? Well, more 
important is that they are members of a 
Hasidic Jewish community in Rockland 
County, New York - the leaders of 
which had endorsed their request. 
Hasidic communities tend to vote. in 
blocs based on the recommendations of 
their leaders, who are therefore courted 
aggressively by politicians. 

Funny, isn't it, that Clinton was happy 
to give them clemency, especially in light 
of his wife's Senate campaign? A small 
world, indeed. So small, in fact, that it is 
being probed by the same team investi-
gating the Rich pardon . After all, it's not 
entirely ethical, much less legal, to trade 
clemency for votes. 

Clinton certainly was busy during his 
last hours in office. Of the 140 individu-
als he pardoned, the Department of Jus-
tice had recommended that 40 remain 
behind bars. 

He was also busy when he departed 
aboard Air Force One, as he and Hillary 
looted everything that had a presidential 
emblem and wasn't nailed down. 

Although this epitomizes the lack of 
integrity of these indi'liduals, we must 
focus on their illegal activities instead. 
After all , these actions are not very diffi-
cult to recognize as such. 

What was going through this man's 
head? Did he honestly believe no one 
would notice his blatant abuse of power? 
His reasoning is simple. He's always got-
ten away with such abuse in the past, so 
he expects to do the same thing now. 

Throughout his presidency, he was 
protected, whenever possible, by the 
media. Moreover, the majority of the 
population simply did not care. As long 
as the economy stayed strong - which 
Clinton had nothing to do with -

Wanna-be Detective Fails Miserably 
Random 
Ravings 

DIVYA RUNCHAL 

Ever since I was 12, I have been consumed by the desire to become a detec-
tive - not just an ordinary detec-
tive, but a pseudo-Batman type 
who hunts dangerous criminals 
single-handedly and wins the 
admiration of millions of grateful 
citizens. 

It all began seven years ago 
when two female FBI agents came 
to my middle school to talk to 
aspiring agents about the merits 
of putting their lives on the line to 
help innocent civilians. I sat 
entranced throughout the 
speech; my eyes glazed over as I 
imagIned myself saying, "Agent 
Runchal. I have a warrant for your 
arrest," to fugitives featured on 

. "America's Most Wanted." I pic-
tured the frozen look of fear on 
their faces as their brains regis-
!ered my last name and imagined 
the thunderous applause from 
city officials as they awarded me 
with numerous awards and a life-
time supply of ice cream sundaes. 

My passion for law enforce-
ment soon accelerated after I 
secured a tour of the FBI's office 
in Los Angeles. I became 
obsessed with the idea that I 
would soon sit in the same neat 
desks occupied by federal agents 
at least twice my age. I bought 
manila folders and labeled them 
with such titles as "serial killers,Â· 
"arsonists" and "other psychos." I 
even spied on my neighbors 

using binoculars and carefully 
recorded any suspicious activity 
in a notebook 1 bought specifical-
ly for "important investigations: 

As the years progressed and 
my obsession increased, I called 
the bureau's Los Angeles office 
and urgently asked them to send 
me an application for employ-
ment. They sent me a pamphlet 
sans application, and after pes-
tering irritated FBI agents and 
clerks, 1 was encouraged to try 
later - preferably much later. 

Regardless, even after becom-
ing disillusioned with the bureau 
after learning about some of its 
subethical actions, I was still 
interested in pursuing a career in 
the law enforcement field. 

In my freshmen year of col-
lege, I searched for illicit criminal 
activity on campus, eager to get 
my foot in the door of the UCSD 
police department. Sadly, either 
due to the fact that there was lit-
tle crime that occul"(Cd on cam-
pus or due to my poor investiga-
tive skills, I was unable to nab 
even one unlucky criminal. 

Yet, this year, I was able to put 
my investigative skills to test 
when I faced my biggest case of 
my short lifetime: the case of the 
missing spiral-bound notebook. 
This was not just an ordinary 
notebook, this was the notebook 
that contained my deepest, dark-
est secrets. Well, the truth is that it 
contained all my notes for second 
quarter and some poorly written 
poems. Nevertheless, this was the 
most valuable possession I have 
- or should I say, had - on cam-
pus, well, besides my ATM card. 

Like any detective who faces a 
difficult task, I prepared myself 
for the reality that the case may 

never be solved. Yet, I gritted my 
teeth and prepared myself for the 
worst. And the worst happened. 
It all started on a seemingly 
innocent day last week. I woke 
up happy, refreshed, without a 
care in the world, vastly unpre-
pared for. what lay before me. 

In a vain attempt to look a bit 
neater than I actually do, I turned 
on the clothing iron to eliminate 
any wrinkles from my clothes. 
Unfortunately, I forgot to turn it 
off after ironing my clothes. After 
I stepped out of the shower, belt-
ing out cheesy. Disney songs, 1 
entered the room and sat on the 
floor. My flesh met metal, and 
before I knew it, my butt was 
burned. 

Realizing the predicament I 
. was in, I anxiously called my 

mother who assured me that 
going to the UCSD Student 
Health Center was the proper 
thing to do. When I mentioned 
that showing a part of my body 
that even my mom would find 
reprehensible would knock an 
attending nurse unconscious, my 
mom told me to get some Vase-
line and "deal with it: As I wob-
bled to school, bitter at the world 
and at my mom for bringing me 
into it, I managed to enter the 
UCSD Student Health Center. 

Yet, amidst a sea of legiti-
mately sick students, I felt morti-
fied walking up to the reception-
ist and telling her that my butt 
had suffered second-degree 
bums. What if she thought I was 
some sick, twisted student who 
did this for kicks? 

As the day progressed or 
should 1 say deteriorated, 1

University Must Protect 
Students from Racism 
By ULA HOLLMAN 
Special to the Guardian 

Idioms such as "Mexican immi-
grants are all on welfare," "blacks 
are criminals" or "Jews are involved 
in a world conspiracy" are widely 
recognized, especially in an acade-
mic environment such as our com-
munity at UCSD, as blatantly racist 
remarks whose purpose is to target 
a specific ethnic or religious group 
and to incite hatred against it. As 
an intelligent, historically aware 
college community, we can distin-
guish activities that promote an 
academic discussion from those 
that disseminate hate and creat(: a 
negative and unsafe campus com-
munity. If such racist activities 
occur on our academic campus, the 
university must take action against 
them, according to UCSD's own 
Principles of Community and 
Hate-Free Campus Campaign. 

The purpose of the university 
environment is to foster a safe and 
academic space, conducive to 
learning. For obvious reasons, 
racism on campus does not provide 
for a safe or an academic environ-
ment. Students of the targeted 
community feel misrepresented, 
hurt, scared and angry. If our uni-
versity is truly committed to creat-
ing a hate-free campus and if it is 
truly dedicated to protecting all 
students, it has an obligation to 
speak out against hateful and hate-
inspiring behavior. 

The ideas disseminated in these 
past few weeks by the Muslim Cul-
tural Club, within the framework of 
"Anti-Zionism Week," are highly 
disturbing because they target a 
specific campus community, name-
ly Zionists - the majority of Jews 
- and singles them out for attack. 

In o ne "Anti-Zionism" lecture 
sponsored by the Muslim Student 
Association, MCC, Arab Student 
Union and Associated Students, 
Bashir Iduoi spoke on the subject 
of Zionism in America. Although 
he claimed that he was not an anti-
Semite, he spent the entire hour-
and-a- half lecture detailing his the-
ory that American Jews, Jewish reli -
gious leaders and Jewish organiza-
tions co ntrol American politics, 
policy and public opinion. "Jewish 
Conspiracy Theory," anyone? 

Not only is this notion ludi-
crous, but it is also a blatantly 
racist, anti-Jewish idea that dates 
back hundreds of years. The same 
racist concept was perhaps most 
clearly articulated in the .Hitler-
sponsored propaganda of Nazi 
Germany. Hitler depicted Jews as 
miserly, power-hungry thugs who 
controlled the wealth of the non-
Jews. T his type of propaganda 
allowed Hitler to sway public opin-
ion against the Jews and make way 
for his Final Solution, or program 
of genocide against the Jewish peo-
ple. 

Hey, if the Jews indeed control 
the politics, policy and public opin-
ion of the United States, then how 
did Gore and Lieberman lose the 
election? 

But seriously, this rhetoric is 
frightening. Added to it the fact 
that anti-Zionism not only attacks 
the biblical and historical connec-
tion that Jews have to the Holy 
Land, but attempts to impose a 
wholly different and incorrect defi-
nition of a religious concept, Zion-
ism, onto the Jewish people. The 
A.S. Council is allowing the MCC 
to tell the Jewish Students what

Racism: 
University sponsorship of 
MCC event was unethical 
continued from paC. I 
they are, and then they are spon-
soring a week against that defini-
tion . If "An t.i -Zionism Week" can 
be sponsored by the university, 
then it should similarly fund an 
"Anti-Palestinian Week: based 
on the definition of a Palestinian 
as one who commits acts of ter-
rorism in order to drive the Jew-
ish people into the sea, an eq ual-
ly preposterous presumption. 

The importance of the events 
of the past few weeks cannot I?e 
ignored. "Anti-Zionism Week" 
affects every minority community 
on campus, including the Muslim 
students. Why not support an 
Anti -Gay Week? Fine, that's a 
legitimate opinion and protected 
free speech according to the A.S. 
Council and the administration. 
While the university may allow 
students the freedom to say what 
they wish, they have a choice 
whether to support student 
speech with student funds. 
Should our money support hate 
speech? What about a week 
protesting the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution? 
Why not? The group could say 
that it was launching a political 
event. Sound f3IT1iliar? Well, as 
educated students and faculty, we 
real ize that an attack on the Four-
teenth Amendment is an attack 
against every minority student on 
campus. 

The MCC has unfortunately 
committed a very serious act: It 
has confused anti-Semitic 
rhetoric with an extremely impor-
tant and va lid political discussion. 
A week of solidarity with the 
Palestinian people, for example, as 
suggested to the MCC by the 
Union of Jewish Students nearly 

two months ago, would be a 
political statement. Instead, this 
"Anti-Zionism Week" attacked a 
community of people that 
includes not only Jews in [srael 
but Jews around the world. 

What is even more disturbing 
is that members of the MCC and 
the MSA were made aware of the 
nature of their program and given 
the opportunity to address our 
concerns, but they chose not to 
do so. At a meeting prior to "Anti-
Zionism Week" mediated by the 
administration, professors Hasan 
Kayali and David Goodblatt of 
the history department explained 
to the leaders of these organiza-
tions why "Anti-Zionism Week" 
is seen as an anti-Semitic attack. 

The non-Muslim and non-
Jewish community on campus 
most likely regards the events of 
the past few weeks as a confusing 
political argument between two 
minority groups disputing the 
reality of a political situation. This 
is simply incorrect. The issue is 
not about politics. The issue is 
one-sided. What the Jewish com-
munity refuses to keep silent 
about is racist speech and propa-
ganda directed at Jews. [t is a Jew-
ish value to work for tolerance 
and human rights. That is why 
these past few weeks have been a 
double tragedy. Not only did the 
MCC knowingly target and attack 
the Jewish community, my com-
munity, and make us feel unsafe 
on campus, but they also suc-
ceeded in alienating us from the 
Palestinian cause. 

[ am devastated that the MCC 
unnecessarily and hatefully 
imposed upon me a false defini-
tion of my religion and conse-
quently alienated me from a 
cause that [ believe in, namely the 
right of Palestinians to their own 
homeland. More importantly, [ 
am disheartened that the univer-
sity refused to afford me equal 
protection. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Column: 
IU-fated investigation 
primed fruitless 
contIna ... ".. ..... I 
learned I had earned a whopping 
68 on a midterm and had little 
chance of getting an A in the 
class. Worse, my feet ached hor-
rendously after being encased for 
hours in uncomfortable !:ioots. To 
top off my disastrous day was the 
untimely loss of my notebook. 

Recognizing that finals are 
only a few weeks away com-
pounded my fear that I would get 
kicked out of UCSD and be 
denied entrance to the FBI, CIA, 
even the LAPD. However, [ tried 
to imagine what Batman would 
do in this situation. 

First, I retraced my steps. I 
went to every location [ visited, 
wandering all over campus with a 
pained expression on my face 
(due to my burns) and a peculiar 
hop in my step (due to my throb-
bing feet) . Next, [ interrogated 
anyone [ could find as to the 
whereabouts of the missing 
object. [ questioned employees of 
Sierra Summit and asked diners if 
they had seen a black notebook 
hidden under a pile of pasta or 
bowl of soup. 

. Perhaps my lowest point - and 
highest in terms of sheer despera-
tion - was when I asked a girl sit-
ting in a toilet stall if she had come 
across a notebook in the rest room. 
. Even the employees of EDNA 
and the Sunshine Store were not 
free from my investigative queries. 
As my anxiety grew, [ became 
more nervous If I couldn't find a 
stupid notebook, how could I find 
a serial killer, a terrorist or an 
armed psycho? [was terrified that 
case number two of my career 
(case number one being the loss 
of my mom's car keys) would 
serve as an omen for the rest of it. 

I realized with a sickening feel-
ing that the FBI may never have a 
place in its ranks for me. After 
summoning the last of my dignity 
- much of which was shredded by 
interviewing anonymous individu-
als for information regarding my 
notebook - [ walked into the 
UCSD police station. The look of 
fear on my face may have suggest-
ed that [ was in bigger trouble than 
[ actually was, because they quick-
ly asked me if [ needed. any help. 
Their concern, however subsided 
when [ informed them that I had 
lost a notebook and inquired as to 
whether it had been returned. 

Sadly, the answer was no. On 
the car ride back home to my 
apartment, [ pondered over the 
fate of my poor, innocent note-
book. Whose unscrupulous 
hands now had possession of the 
sheets of paper lined with random 
notes and cheesy poetry? What if 
[ never found it? Would my 
teachers forgive me and out of 
unwavering sympathy, give me A's 
for the quarter? Would a literary 
agent find my bad poetry a mark 
of hidden genius and offer me 
millions of dollars to publish it? 
These prospects, although tanta-
lizing, seemed unlikely. 

Like Sherlock Holmes, [ nar-
rowed everything down to the 
obvious and realized with a 
sunken heart that my notebook 
was probably hidden in a mess of 
banana peels, bubble-gum wrap-
pers and other refuse in a trash 
can somewhere on campus. 

Yet, even though I'm moving 
on and ricking up the shattered 
pieces 0 my life (I'm going to go 
buy a new notebook from the 
bookstore), I still miss the tattered 
papers covered with food and 
drink stains that contain my notes. 

Someone, somewhere on cam-
pus, has information about its 
whereabouts. And it's up to me to 
find that person. Don't count on 
it, though.

Scandal: 
Presidential f"lT'Io!zs 
tarnish Clinton's image 
~ ... "... ...... 
nobody cared how many laws he 
broke. 

Apparently Clinton did not real-
ize that the rules would change the 
moment he left office. Although he 
boasted a very 'high performance 
approval rating, his personal 
approval rating was, and still 'is, 
embarrassingly low. 

Now that the American people 
don't consider Clinton essential to 
the economy, they Can despise his 
abominable character; the thanks of 
a grateful nation. The media sees 
this trend in public sentiment and is 
happy to perpetuate it . That's what 
selling newspapers is all about. 

This isn't just a partisan Repub-
lican issue. His fellow Democrats 
are turning against him as well . 
Former President Jimmy Carter, the 
last Democrat to hold the presi-
dency before Clinton, has 
denounced his actions as disgrace-
ful to the office and attributes them 
to donations and gifts. 

[ hope the American people are 
finally opening their eyes. Look at 
this guy. He's scum. [ hope he'll hide 
in the same ditch as his "spiritual 
advisor: Jesse "Rent-A-Mob" Jack-
son. They have a lot in common. 

Pardoning these criminals for 
payoffs was incredulous.and illegal. 
This mess will someday go down in 
history as "Pardongate." 

Clinton got away with perjury, 
but [ hope he doesn't get away with 
this. The hounds are after him; at 
least two legal teams are investigat-
ing these matters. With any luck, 
they'll find the evidence they need 
to put this turkey away. 

[f Clinton goes to jail, President 
Bush will not pardon him, and [ 
certainly can't imagine a soul who 
would care.

Stephen D. Fournier, pastor of the 
Community Bible Church in this 
rllral community of 3,000, the 
Milford Central School seemed 
the obvious place to hold meet-

- ings of the Good News Club, a 
church-run youth group. The 
school serves as communal hub, 
where after school hours class-
rooms buzz with meetings of the 
4-H Club, Rotarians and the Boy 
Scouts. 

The school refused, however, 
saying the club, which evangelizes 
children ages 5 to 12, was aimed 
atesrablishing religion, and there-
fore violated not only school poli-
cy but the U.S. Constitution. On 
Wednesday, after four years of 
legal fights, lawyers for Fournier 
will argue before the U.S. 
Supreme Court that the school 

.discriminated against the group 
and violated his FIrst Amendment 
right of free speech. 

The dispute is not merely a 
local one. Run by a group of 
born-again believers called the 
Child Evangelism Fellowship, 
whose sole "Stated purpose is to 
evangelize children and establish

them as members of Christian 
churches, the Good News Club 
operates 4,622 clubs in this coun-
try and othe.rs in 142 nations. The 
fellowship says it meets in more 
than 500 schools nationwide. 

Fournier and his wife, Darlcen, 
describe the club as a place where 
children sing songs and hear s~ 
ries that reinforce " morals from a 
Christian perspective: 

But to a range of groups, from 
national school organizations to 
civil libertarians, the Good News 
Club is a chipper moniker for 
religious coercion of young chil-
dren. 

As President Bush aims to 
involve religious groups in social 
service and suggests relaxing rules 
on federal funding to parochial 
schools. school lawyers across the 
country say the case is a pivotal 

one in the high court's evolving 
definition of the relationship 
between churches and public 
schools. 

uThis would be a very decep-
tive and dangerous precedent: 
said Barry W. Lynn, a minister and 
executive director of Americans 
United for Separation of Church 
and State, which filed a brief sup-
porting the school. "[t's not about 
the content of the speech, it's 
about a simple principle: You have 
a captive audience of young 
schoolchildren. Do you open 
them up or not for adult-led 
evangelism after the school bell 
rings?W 

To the Fourniers' supporters, 
the potential is equally frighten-
ing. 

MThe question is, can schools 
determine on a whimsy which 
groups they do or do not like?" 
said John W. Whitehead, president 
of the Rutherford Institute, a con-
servative group in Virginia that 
has financed the Fourniers' law-
suits.

United States, NATO Support Access 
for Serbia to Kosovo Buffer Zone 

BRUSSELS - Secretary of 
State Colin Powell ~id Tuesday 
that the United States is prepared 
to allow Serbian soldieJ's back into 
a three-mile-wide buffer zone 
along the Kosovo border, where 
Albanian militants have been 
increasingly active. 

Such a concession would be 
the first such easing of the stern 
restrictions that NATO imposed 
on the Yugoslav army after the 
bombing campaign of 1999. The 
"ground safety zone," on the 
Serbs' side of the border, was set 
up to keep Yugoslav and Serbian 
troops and NATO peacekeepers 
well separated after the Kosovo 
war, while Slobodan Milosevic 
was still in power. Only lightly 
armed police officers are now 
allowed in' the area. 

But one section, the Presevo 
valley, has become a haven for 
armed Kosovar Albanian guerril-
las who seem to want to annex the 
valley to an independent Kosovo. 
NATO has been increasingly con-
cerned that the conflict could 
intensify, but has been reluctant to

Thesday, with Powell standing 
beside him, Lord Robertson, the 
secretary-general of NATO, said 
NATO was prepared to carry out a

return the area to Serb authorities. 
But Robertson said NATO needed 
"further military advice" to carry 
out the plan.

NATO is setting is that Serbian

were involved in attacks on

New York TImes, before the case

militants have inflamed passions, 
leading to concerns at NATO 
about renewed fighting.

In Speech Jo C~ngress, 
Bush Stresses Tax Cut 

WASHINGTON - President 
Bush turned full force to the diffi-
cult ljsk of selling the Congress 
and die country on his legislative 
agenda Tuesday night, using a 
nationally televised address from 
the House chamber to cast his 
proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut as 
"reasonable and responsible." 

[n the most formal and com-
prehensive speech of his nascent 
presidency, Bush said that a 
blessed era of robust surpluses 
would enable the federal govern-
ment to reduce taxes by that 
amount over 10 years and still 
spend all that it needed to on edu-
cation , prescription drugs and 
social programs. 

The result, Bush said, would 
be a government balanced 
between a constructive in-volve-
ment in people's lives and an 
equally beneficial detachment 
from them. 

"Government has a role, and 
an important one," Bush said. "Yet 
too much government crowds out 
initiative and hard work, private 
charity and the private economy. 
Our new governing vision says 
that government should be active, 
but lim,ited; engaged, but not 
overbearing. " 

His speech Tuesday night rep-
resented Bush's best, most visible 
opportunity to make his case, not

only for a tax cut but also for his 
education proposals and his plan 
for a partial privatization of the 
Social Security entitlement pro-
gram. 

The speech was intended to set 
the stage for the release on 
Wednesday of an actual outline of 
Bush's federal budget for the fis-
cal year 2002. The administration 
is expected to release a fully 
detailed budget in April. 

But the speech was also an 
early and important test, with a 
result to be determined down the 
road, of Bush's powers of persua-
sion, of his ability not only to 
command affection but also to 
inspire confidence and shape 
public opinion. 

And it seemed to mark a turn -
ing point from the grace period of 
Bush 's charm offensive to the 
uncertain, inevitably contentious 
work of getting the legislation he 
wants passed. 

As he had during his presiden-
tial campaign, Bush presented 
cutting taxes as a central part of 
that vision and a necessary amu let 
against lawmakers converting sur-
pluses into budgetary fat , a temp-
tation that he suggested was irre-
sistible.

Finding the right vacation spot 
can be difficult, especially when 
tackling something as tepid as 
spring break. It's that elusive week 
when some go south of the border 
after having seen "Co-eds Gone 
Wild" for the umpteenth time. 
Others just like to bring a good old 
pair of jeans and recreate their own 
fear and loathing in Las Vegas or 
Sedona or Yonkers. 

However, for many, spring break 
is seen as a week designed for 
hibernation. Most leam, after their 
fint break, that they can't cram a 
feature-length "Porky's" movie into 
one week. It practically takes half 
the vacation getting to and from 
the location. 

[f any lesson can be learned 
while away, it's definitely a course 
in economics. All vacations are 
expensive, even the cheap ones. 
And if your name isn't attached to 
a trust fund, it hurts to pay 20 
bucks for each fill-up. You start 
wishing that spacious sport-utility

has managed to retain the natural

Besides its travel brochure schpiel, 
Vancouver remains a city full of 
eclectic lifestyles and flavors. 

Canada's British Common-
wealth ties have always encouraged

Surprisingly, these communities 
all seem to thrive with each other, 
as opposed to against each other, in 
what can only be called Canadian 
hospitality. Herein lies the greatest 
difference between Vancouver and 
other urban meccas such as New 
York or Los Angeles: The people

Vancouver to where people ASK

Many of the motels have an honor

where their vacant rooms are left

spooky for the American not used 
to anything genuine. 

As for the actual city, its inhabi-

contradiction of iinages from the 
timeworn European brickwork of 
its Gaslamp Quarter to the swarthy 
seaport atmosphere by the bay. The 
trendy Robson Street, with its 
Japanese noodle houses, looks like 
something straight out of "Blade 
Runner," with neon kanji flashing

Death By Chocol~te 
"Death By Chocolate" 

Jetset Records 
B 

Jf yolt are into '60s British go-go pop, 
then you have to check out the new self-
titled debut from Death by Chocolate. The 
album is ' highly reminiscent of vintage 
albums, with poetic twists from the non-
sequitur lyricist, Angie Tillet. 

Tillet, who is a teenage chambermaid 
from the English tourist town of Clacton-
on-Sea, uses her powerfully youthful view of 
the world to create hypnotic free-association 
poetry. Her love of chocolate, as well as col-
ors and letters, evokes childhood memories 
as she recites her poems in her bored school-
girl voice, which is surprisingly mesmerizing. 

Behind this lyrical trance, the funky-pop 
keyboard and bubble gum psychedelia of the 
instrumentation takes you back to a '60s spy 
movie and gives the music an authentic vin-
tage feel. The combination of Tillet's giddy 
instrumentation and rather minimalist 
melodies creates a recipe for great music that 
will satisfy your Anglophilic sweet tooth. 

[n addition to these original songs, 
Tillet's musical confections include creative 
covers to old classics such as "[fYoll Want to 
Sing Out, S~g Out" by Cat Stevens. Alto-
gether, this creative album is amazing in its 
recreation of the sounds of the past. With its 
psychedelic moods, Tillet's songs create a 
true escape into a youthful world of fantasy.

mance with songwriting great Elton John. 
With all of this, one has to reminisce and 
wonder: Who the hell is Steely Dan? 

Well, the Napster-hating and money-lov-
ing Recording Industry Association of Amer-
ica has slapped together its annual compila-
tion of Grammy-nominated songs in the cre-
atively titled "Grammy Nominees 2001." 

For the millionth time, everyone can lis-
ten to the same old popular songs that we 
still see on MTV and hear on the radio -
that is, if you are crazy enough to buy this 
poor excuse for a coaster. 

All right, so maybe that was a little harsh 
- but seriously, who .of sane mind would 
. buya CD packed with a basic assortment of 
random songs spanning completely different 
musical genres? After all, where else can you 
find an album that pairs sickly sweet Britney 
Spears with radical prog-rockers Radiohead? 
And once again, who is Steely Dan? 

As in all collections, there really is no 
theme or tone. All the tracks from ' N Sync's 
"Bye Bye Bye" to Paul Simon's "You're The 
One" totally negate one another and make the 
whole CD sound like an overplayed pop radio 
station. By now, most people ought to be sick 
of Christina Aguilera'S "What A Girl Wants; 
and the sound of The Corrs' "Breathless" 
would only throw them into convulsions. 

It's not that the songs are all that bad, but 
the album's timing couldn't be worse. I 
mean, how many times do we have to Cor-
rectly identify "The Real Slim Shady?" 
Besides, an academy that granted "Best New 
Artist" to a musician's sixth album and 
who's been in the business for 14 years isn't 
deserving of any money. Do us all a favor 
and buy the real albums instead, especially 
Steely Dan's "Two Against Nature."

Southern California and beyond: 

The Ataris Shake 
Up the Epicentre 
Sold-out release party thrills fans, 
audience invited for onstage finale 
By MICHAEL KAMINSKY 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

[ decided to go to The Ataris' 
release party by myself because 
I'm afraid of calling girls. That 
worked out well, because by the 
time I got to the Epicentre, well 
over a thousand high school and 
college students had already cir-
cled the building trying to get in. 

The venue, which holds about 
550 people, had long been sold out 
to the die-hard fans who had trav-
eled from Los Angeles and Santa 
Barbara at the break of dawn. By this 
time, a small riot had broken out up 
front as concert-goers tried to surge 
past security, banging on the glass, 
trying to sneak in other ways. [ 
joined the latter and made my way in 
through a rear security door. 

The Ataris got their start after 
slipping a demo tape to a member 
of The Vandals. After being picked 
up by a record label and moving to 
California to tour mercilessly, they 
have garnered a large fan base all 
over America. They are currently 
on tour to support their new 
album, "End Is Forever," and their 
new store in Santa Barbara, Down 
on Haley. 

Agent 51 and No Motiv 
warmed up the crowd with a pow-
erful punk set that steamed the 

windows with raw energy. Nerf 
Herder then took the stage, greet-
ed with puzzled expressions from 
many in the audience. They were 
quickly accepted after rocking 
through their hits "Sorry" and 
"Van Halen" and debuting new 
songs off their album "How To 
Meet Girls." Displaying a fun and 
carefree attitude often absentÂ· in 
music today, they invited audience 
members on stage to play guitar 
and sing along with them. 

The Ataris finally took the stage 
to great fanfare. They were full of 
pure emotion as vocalist Kris Roe 
sang of lost love and video games, 
and the crowd reacted by forming a 
mosh pit that almost consumed 
half the building. 

The band stormed through old 
favorites such as "My Hotel Year" 
and "Your Boyfriend Sucks,n and 
introduced fans to new ones such 
as "Bad Case of Broken Heart." 
The show culminated with every-
one's favorite song, "San Dimas 
High School Football Rules,n with 
the band inviting the audience to 
come on stage for a sing-a-Iong 
"We Are the World n -style grand 
finale. 

To all those who didn't make it 
in, the band pr.omised they would 
be back. And when they are, make 
sure to show up early.

tels are filled with students from 
Germany, Brazil and South Africa. 
Add the whole Vancouver vibe of 
welcoming your neighbor, and 
you have a strange and mysterious 
land that not only encourages 
social interaction, but personal 
introspection as well, making it a 
wonderful destination for the soli-
tary wanderer. 

In one of the oldest human 
habitations in North America, 
what people create is still far less 
impressive than what nature has 
already created. The myth of the 
Raven, the Bear and the Whale -
precious stories the native peoples 
have always told - are still woven 
into the landscape. 

Here are some cheap eats and 
hostels the budgeted student may 
not find in regular travel books. 
Information on all other attrac-
tions such as Vancouver's China-
town night market and the lIIu-
minares Lantern Festival where 
thousands of lanterns are lit 
around Trout Lake can be found 
at the border crossing in the visi-
tors desk. 

To get to Vancouver, simply 
take Interstate 5 north until it 
becomes Canada Highway 99 at 
the border and head northwest 
into the city. Just follow the signs 
for the Granville Street Bridge. Do 
not bring any illegal items, includ-
ing cleaned water-pipes, kegs or 
rolling papers. There's plenty 
enough to "buyn in Vancouver and 
you don't want to be stuck for 
three hours repeating, "No, I am 
not carrying any illegal substances 
on me or my automobile." Plus, 
it's cheaper there, whatever it is 
you want to buy. Also, be very 
wary of the city's traffic codes; 
Mounties like to hunt, and Amer-
icans with California plates;are the

worthwhile thing missing in Van-
couver - Roberto's. 

restaurant's personal collection of 
lunch boxes and hats. There is 
enough memorabilia and other 
assorted eye candy to keep any 
attention deficit disorder in check. 
It's probably best to stick to the 
good old fashioned "Canadian" 
breakfast, which includes eggs, 
ham, hash browns, toast with jam, 
and Sophie's own homemade hot 
pepper sauce. $7-$15.

Happy Hour 
Quite possibly the most under-

appreciated way of snagging a free 
meal. the elusive "happy hourn 
can lead wayward travelers into a 
mecca of wing dings, toaster 
strudels and coconut-popcorn 
shrimp. For the price of a soft 
drink or a cheap beer, you can 
revel in splendid lounge lizard 
fashion and enjoy all the appetiz-
ers you can eat in Vancouver's 
best hotels. 

Heron's Bar in the Waterfront 
Centre Hotel (900 Canada Place) 
o'ffers the whole spread from dim

Best of all, it's complimentary. 
Trader Vic's bar in the Westin 
Bayshore Hotel (1601 W. Georgia

sweet and sour spareribs and deep

patrons pizza, calamari and pot-
stickers. Of course, the granddad-
dy of aU complimentary meals can 
be found in . the Wedgewood

Hornby St.), where sushi, caviar 
and smoked salmon are regular 
weekday treats.

After getting your fill of appe-

Asian: To Go 
Leaving Vancouver without 

tasting its Chinese cuisine is like 
going to San Francisco and, well, 
not having Chinese food. [n point 
of fact, this city has become Â· a 
haven for numerous Asian immi-
grants, and along with them, the 
exotic flavors and tastes of their 
cuisine. 

Start your tour in Richmond at 
the Radisson President Hotel 
(8181 Cambie Rd.) . Connected to 
the hotel is the President Plaza, 
one of five Asian-style malls (the 
others being Yoahan Centre, 
Aberdeen Centre, Parker Place 
and Fairchild Square) located 
within a three-block radius of one 
another. [nterestingly, th ere is 
more retail space here than in 
Vancouver's Chinatown, and 
you'll find bargains galore if you're 
willing to haggle. However, the 
most fascinating component of 
this behemoth complex is its Bud-
dhist temple, the only mall in the 
Western hemisphere with such a 
temple. After each llunday's wor-
ship ceremonies, Buddhists and 
non-Buddhists alike are served a 
free vegetarian lunch along a 
breathtaking view of the North 
Shore Mountains. 

If there is some spare change 
burning holes in your pockets, try 
the multitude of street vendors 
selling Singaporean curries, Viet-
namese pho, Chinese dim sum, 
Chiu Chow stirfries and rich 
Hong Kong coffee all for under 
five bucks. Finish your mini-
excursion with a visit to Ten Ren 
Tea & Ginseng, a tea house with 
complimentary ginseng tea on tap. 
And if you show the slightest 
interest, you -may be invited to 
share a private tea ceremony with 
the tea house. Stamps from the 
Chinese post office make great 
souvenirs.

And what is more American than 
beginning the album with cheer-

unless you count the references to

"Hello Time Bomb,n the first 
single off the album, is harder than 
most of the songs recorded, yet it 
follows the same dark lyrics of the 
entire album. 

"Subw.bian is as much of a ballad 
as you can ask for on a rock-alterna-

tracks follow this gloomy tone, the 
selection is particularly agreeable.

Fencing Finishe~ Strong 
Cal Tech, Fullerton have no shot against the 
mighty Tritons and their swift swords. 
Iy ROIIIRT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD fencing team had a 
great showing at a meet against Cal 
Tech and California' State 
University Fullerton in Pasadena 
this weekend, 

The men made a stabbing 
against Cal Tech, winning the foil 
round 8-1 and the epee 9-0. 
Unfortunately, the TIitons did not 
fare as well in the sabre, losing 6-3. 

The women's team was strong 
in spite of not having a foil squad. 
It downed Cal Tech in epee 8-1 
and were victorious in sabre 5-4. 

The men's team did not let up 
against Fullenon, winning the foil 
5-4, epee 6-3 ar,d sabre 8-1.Â·

ContI ...... frOIII ..... I I 
Hartwick 3-0 in the third period, a 
lead that held for the duration of 
the match and was enough to get 
the team its first win , Renae 
Coulter led the Tritons with a hat 
trick, while Hilary Smith and 
Emma Kudritzki had a pair of tal-
lies apiece. 

The Tritons' fourth and final 
match pitted them against the 
University of the Pacific in a hard-
fought, tooth-and-nail battle to 
the death. 

Pacific exploded out of the gate, 
putting away three goals in the 
first quaner while blanking the 
Triton offense. UCSD answered in 
the second with four goals to 
UOP's two, to pull within one. 
Pacific had the only third-quarter 
goal, which set the score at 6-4

truly get into the spirit of th is 
annual college tradition, things 
won't seem so bad. 

It may get in the way of your 
studying for finals, but who cares? 
Cenainly not you. You may bomb 
a test, but you will be too busy fan-
tasizing about that trip to Cabo 
San Lucas to care. Just think of the 
margaritas and all the fine senori-
tas (or senors, if you are of the 
female persuasion) whom you will 
soon be meeting, and all of a sud-
den that D in biology doesn't 
sound so bad. 

Finally, there is the spring plat-
form of intramural sports to look 
forward to. 

Now this one is new for me this 
year. Until last year, I hadn't 
embraced the idea of 1M culture. 
Boy, I didn't know what I was 
missing. There is nothing like wak-
ing up early on a Saturday morn-
ing after a hard night of drinking 
(um, I mean studying and going to 
sleep early, mom and dad) and 
going out to RIMAC Field to playa 
nice game of intramural soccer. 

Again, the UCSD women's 
team did not have a foil squad 
against Fullenon but took out its 
frustrations in the epee and sabre, 
winning those two contests 9-0 
and 8-1 respectively. 

These matches wound up the 
Tritons' regular season, The 
men's squad finishÂ«;d first in epee 
with an 11 -1 in the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Conference. It placed 
second in foil with an 11 -1 mark 
and second in sabre at 1 0-2. 

The women took tops in epee 
and sabre. 

The Tritons will next wield their 
blades in the NCAA West 
Regional Championships at 
Colorado Springs, Colo. on March 
10. 

heading into the all- important 
founh frame. UCSD met the chal-
lenge with grit and aplomb, pop-
ping in three scores and holding 
Pacific to only one. 

A tied game was to be decided 
in a shoot-out, and UCSD came 
out ready to rock, scoring the 
only goal after four shutout 
rounds, and then blanking UOP 
in its fifth and final shot to snag 
the victory. 

The Tritons ended the tourna-
ment in 13th place, a slot that 
doesn't truly reflect their play 
over the weekend. They were on 
the cusp of victory in 'virtually all 
their matches, A bounce here. or a 
splash there, and things could 
have ended up a whole lot differ-
ent. 

The Tritons are still holding 
their heads high, and eagerly 
anticipating their next matchups. 
They will next hit Canyonview 
Pool Sunday at 10 a.m. against 
University of Michigan in what 
should be a rousing contest. 

And don't th ink that not having 
any ability as a soccer player is any 
kind of excuse. The fact that my 
friends and I were placed in a divi-
sion far too talented for our apti-
tude made last year's league all that 
much more fun, 

Typically, half of my team 
would still be in a drunken haze 
from the night before, and within 
the first five minutes the game 
would be so far out of reach that 
we didn't have a chance in hell of 
even making it respectable. 

Was this a problem for us? Of 
course not. The fact that we 
weren't even close to competitive 
made the league that much more 
fun. We could laugh at ourselves 
even harder than our opponents 
were laughing at us. And on the 
rare occasion that we did score a 
goal, we could celebrate like we 
had just brought home the 
Olympic gold, Hell, the two times 
that I actually put the ball through 
the little cones, I wished I was a girl 
so I could rip off my shin and 
show my Nike sports bra like 
Brandi Chastain, 

Basically, what I am saying is 
that even though it seems like this 
time of year will never end and that 
things will alwaY" suck, cheer up. 
The good times are right around 
the comer.

came pouring down, forcing the cancella-
tion of the second half of the four-game 
series. 

Senior Eli Albertson was one of the 
offensive stars for the Gators over the 
weekend . He pounded out three doubles, 
scored twice, and had two RBis, while 
going 6 for 8 on the weekend. This effort 
earned the left fielder the Rawli~g CCAA 
Baseball Player of the Week honor. 
Delaney picked up three hits and a run 
scored, and catcher Joe Perry added four 
hits, an RBI and three runs scored in the 
Gators' victories over the weekends. 

The Tritons were led offensively by the 
bat of Tyler Sullivan, who hammered out 
five hits, two RBis and two runs scored. 

Coach Dan O'Brien is confident in the 
ability of his squad, despite its play to date. 

Thursday, March 1, 2001 

"What is encouraging is that we are 
not playing well, yet we continue to stay in 
ball games," he said. "We have the ability 
to be competitive in the CCAA. It is all 
within our contro\." 

With the two victories, the Gators ' 
record climbs to 2-0 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association action and 
2-5 overall. The Tritons' record now stands 
at 5-8 overall and 1-5 in CCAA play. 

If the Tritons hope to improve on this 
record, they need to expend some more 
effort, according to O'Brien . 

"If we go out there and want to com-
pete then we will be successful," he said. 
"We need to do the little things and be 
more competitive in order to succeed." 

UCSD will see action next weekend 
when it travels to Chico State to do battle 
with its club in a CCM four-game series. 
The Tritons may tinker with their strategy a 
bit to shake things up against the Wildcats. 

"We are goin$ to mix things up for the 
weekend,Â· O'BrIen said. "We're going to 
go into it with a new philosophy and just 
try to be solid fundamentally. If we can 
keep it simple then we can win."

BILL BURGER 

I hate this time of year! For those of you who aren't fresh-men, you know what I am 
talking about. For those of you who 
are, you will know soon. The end of 
winter quarter sucks. 

With Winterfest and Mardi Gras 
slowly fading away in our rear-view 
mirrors, many of you have nothing 
in the immediate future to look 
forward to. Sun God seems like an 
eon away, and spring break, the one 
bastion of fun in the relatively near 
future, is preceded by finals week. 
The next few weeks will be charac-
terized by a great deal of moping 
around and general apathy (l know 
that to many of you this sounds 
like the rest of the year at UCSD, 
but believe me. this time of year is 
worse.) 

But I bring you good news. 
There are at least three things to do 
to get through this thoroughly 
putrid time of year. 

First of all, there is always your 
friend and mine, the bottle. Just 
because it's the end of winter quar-
ter doesn't mean that all of a sud-
den the grocery stores stop selling 
booze. If you feel depressed, drink-
ing is always a good way to put an 
end to your sorrows. I know that all 
those psychiatrists tell you that this 
is a bad way to deal with problems, 
but that is just them being jealous. 

Secondly, you can plan a kick-
ass spring break vacation. If you

By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD g.>lf team finished 
in eighth place at the UC Davis 
Aggie Invitatioll~1 at EI Macero 
Country Club in Davis Monday 
and Tuesday. 

The Tritons scored a 916 on 
the par 72, 6,827-yard course. 

California State University 
Bakersfield took the top spot with 
an 873. 

The top overall golfer was 
Bakersfield's Kevin Klebe, who 
shot a three-under-par 213. The 
top Triton finisher was Matt 
Howe who stroked a 228, good 
enough to tie him for 32nd. 

Darrin Sullivan tied for 39th 
with a 230 and Ben Page tied for 
43rd with a 231. Andy Thompson 
tied for 60th with a 236 and Blake

Not a Very Good UCSD Baseball Weekend 
Tritons lose four games, two to the rain and two to San Francisco State, 9-7 and 5-2 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

Rai n, rain, go away, come 
again some other day, preferably 
a day when we've got no games 
scheduled. 

That twist on the old chil-
dren's song was undoubtedly 
running through the minds of 
the players on' the UCSD base-
ball team as they watched half of 
their four-game series with San 
Francisco State University go 
down the drain due to the soggy 
weather. The two other games 
were washouts of a different 
nature for the Tritons, as they 
lost both tilts to the second-
place Gators. 

The first game, held Saturday 
at Triton field, saw offensive 
action from the first batter. 
Chris Delaney opened the game 
with a double for SFSU, and 
later scored one of the two 
Gator runs. UCSD answered 
back with one run of its own in 
the bottom of the first. 
Shortstop Tylor Sullivan popped 
a double to right, advanced to 
third on a balk, then scored on a 
wild pitch. 

SFSU added to its lead with 
four more runs in an extremely 
sloppily played third inning that 
included a pair of Triton wild 
pitches, a beanball and a miscue 
out in right field that came back 
to haunt the Tritons for a couple 
of runs. 

Down 9-1 in the fifth, UCSD 
began to mount a rally of its 
own, taking advantage of Gator 
pitcher Arron Adams' sporadic 
control to score three runs on 
two walks, a hit batter and a 
Sullivan double to pull within 
five. They added single runs in 
the seventh on third baseman 
Chad Addison 's sacrifice fly and 
in the ninth on an Addison RBI 
single. Later on in the ninth, 
down 9-7 with the two tying 

runs on base, Matt Flaherty 
tlosed the door on the Tritons 
by inducing catcher Ryan 
Larsen to fly out to center field 
and getting Eric Thorpe to 
ground out to second. 

The Triton bats were silent 
for most of game two of the 
Saturday doubleheader, as 
SFSU's Sam Paraza allowed a 
pithy five hits in the seven-
inning contest. The Tritons were 
trailing five-nil heading into the 
final in ning when Nate Bestul 
sparked a one-out rally with a 
single to center. After advancing 
on a passed ball, he later scored 
on Blair Suzuki's sacri fice to 
center. David Hawk reached on 
a walk and moved to third on 
the same fly ball, then scored on 
a wild pitch. 

The Tritons then began to till 
the bases with singles by 
Anthony Lococo and Sullivan. 
At this point, the amount of 
light was not sufficient to play 
the inning out and the umpire 
suspended the game on account 
of darkness. The game was to be 
finished up the following morn-
ing before the day's doublehead-
er. 

Sunday morning. the Gators 
chose to bring in closer Flaherty 
once again to quell the UCSD 
rally and he once again did the 
job, silencing the Tritons' bats 
with help from a friend. After 
handing the free pass to Hawk 
that loaded the bases, Addison 
sent a shot in the direction of 
third baseman Frankie Diaz. 
Guarding the line to protect 
against a double, he lunged to 
his left to make the grab, then 
righted himself and gunned 
Addison down at first to seal the 
Gator victory. 

Then, perhaps in an almighty 
act of heavenly benevolence, the 
skies opened' up and the rain

Tritons S~y Afloat at Tournament Track Holds 
Its Own at 
Tri-Meet 

Women's W?ter polo wins two, loses two at Santa Barbara 
By aeon BUIIItOUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's water 
polo team packed up its Speedos 
and caps, grabbed a couple of 
Gatorades and Power Bars and 
loaded up the bus. Then the 
players took their seats, buckled 
their seatb.elts and began their 
jaunt up Interstate 5 to UC Santa 
Barbara. 

Why all the fuss? The UCSB 
Gaucho Women's Water Polo 
Tournament, that's what: The 
tournament, held Feb. 24 to Feb. 
25 at UCSB's campus pool, 
attracts teams from all over 
California and beyond. The 
Gaucho tourney was a pool-play 
affair that drew teams from as far 

as Michigan and Princeton, as 
well as the typical Golden State 
teams. 

The Tritons' first match was 
against San jose State. SjSU 
quickly made its presence felt in 
the skirmish, netting three goals 
and holding UCSD scoreless in 
the first quarter. The Tritons fired 
back with two goals in the sec-
ond ar.d four in the third to pull 
within one at 7-6. But San jose 
caged three goals to the Tritons' 
two in the final quarter to van-
quish its So-Cal foes. 

Christine Welsh had a game-
high three goals while leading 
SJSU to victory. Danielle Boyle, 
Erin Welsh . and Samara 
Silverman each had two goals for 
the 1litons. 

UCSD's second game, against 
University of Michigan, was 
another closely contested match. 
The score was knotted at four 
going into the third quarter, 
when Michigan took a scant
