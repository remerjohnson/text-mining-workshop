Laga Wants to Make Council Work 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

The AS Council should act as 
a "reality check" on its 
members, and not again 
become an arena for the often 
acrimonious partisan debate it 
was used for this year, Nancy 
Laga, who will be inaugurated 
Thursday as Council chair, 
ay . 
Laga , who was elected AS 

vice president three weeks ago, 
says the Council meetings 
should serve to keep informa-
tion before the Council 
member , and to make sure 
they're doing their job, but 
hould not be the main busines 

pla ce of the government. 
" There were a few hardcores 

who worked hard thi year , but 

people weren't working 
together ... people were coming 
to the meetings and trying to 
get everything done there . That 
just didn 't work. 

" We ha d an attendance 
problem beca u e college 
representative didn 't have 
any defined responsibilities. 
They had an identity crisis over 
what they were supposed to be 
doing , so they didn 't do 
anything," Laga believes . 

Laga hopes to correct this by 
getting each of them involved: 
" My goal is to have each of the 
twenty-two members of the 
council working on their own , 
project by the end of the year." 

To reinforce that, Laga ays 
the Rule Committe e is 
working on a ounc il at-

tendance requirement. The 
proposal ca lls for auto-
matically instituting removal 
procedu res against any Council 
member who misses three 
meetings. 

The Council member would 
then be responsible for 
convincing his colleagues not to 
remove him from office. 

To avoid long, difficult 
Counci l meetings , Laga also 
hopes to have most debate and 
busine s resolved in AS 
committe s. 

Laga al 0 believes the AS 
hasn ' t bee n doing enough 
outreac h to student and 
organization . and plans to 
correct tha t. 

" Carlos (Monta lvo, n w AS 
pre ident) wa nt to meet with 

every student organization or 
government at le a t once 
during the year, and J think we 
have to establish some kind of 
communication with the 
students," she says. 

Laga has been preparing to 
assume the vice presidency but 
inge ting " massive" a mounts 
of budget information, " more 
than I knew existed on this 
campus. I'm getting infor-
mation about people I never 
even knew existed." 

The information should be 
helpful , though, because Laga 
says one of her top goals is to 
" stay on top of administrative 
and faculty concern . 

" We want to know what' 
going on so that decision won't

Brown Says 
Gas Stations 
Should Open 
Weekends 

As long lines surrounded the 
few gasoline stations open 
yesterday , Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr . moved to force more 
stations to pump the precious 
fuel on weekends. 

Brown's office in Sacramento 
aid he ha d directed state 

Energy Commission Chairman 
Richard Maullin to draft 
emerge n cy regul atio ns 
requiring at least half of the 
stations in counties partici-
pating in the oddeven gasoline 
allocation program to remain 
open weekends. 

" The odd-even plan depends 
on the availability of gas on a 
even-day basis," Brown said. 

" Cu rrently , many stations in 
Cal ifornia are open only 
Monday through Friday." 

Brown, who last Tuesday 
proc laimed a state of 
emergency implementing the 
od d -even gas allocation 
progra m in most parts of the 
state, directed Maullin to give 
him the new regul a tion s 
Tuesday morning for hi s 
immediate signature. 

The odd-even plan had mixed 
success throughout the week, 
but as the 'weekend ap-
proached, the Auto Club 
predicted that more than 90 
percent of California 's gas 
sta tions would be c losed 
Saturday and Sunday . That 
forecast was borne out by long 
lines and short tempers at those 
s tations pumping over the 
weekend. 

In San Francisco, service 
stat ion manager Raymond 
Chin fumed when motorists 
refused to leave after he 
announced his allotment forthe 
day was gone. 

" This is ridiculous ," aid 
Chin, who finally agreed to 
pump for another 45 mir.ute . 
" You try to give people a break 
by taying open on Sunda: ' and 
look what happens ...

Student Service 
Programs Eyed 
Task Force Checking Efficiency 

By Eric Harpell 
Senior taU Writer 

An administration ta k force 
will scrutinize the funding and 
organization of student service 
programs to make " desirable 
change ," administration 
Executive Secretary Wayne 
Gray said last week. 

" The task force is trying to 
find out how certain depart-
ments can be run better," Gray 
said, denying that the task 
force will be trying to " get 
anybody 's job. " 

The "task group," formed by 
vice chancellors Paul Saltman 
a nd Richard Armitage, will 
examine student recruitment, 
academic advising, academic 
support and programming, 
accordi ng to task force 
chairman Jo eph Watson, 
Third College's provost. 

Four subcommittee which 
will include two to five 
members each, will decide on 
their own approach to "finding 

the problems" in eaeh task 
group area, said Gray. 

After July 1, the sub-
committee will assemble their 
finding and prepare a written 
report to Saltman a nd 
Armitage. 

Each subcommittee will take 
a "deep " look into how 
efficiently departments and 
organizations in the university 
are being run to see if students 
are receiving " the best service 
possible ." said Watson. 

A major area of study will be 
the problem of st udent 
retention . All areas related to 
" making the tudents want to 
stay here," will be covered, 
sai d Gray. Subcommittees 
concer n ed with student 
retention will study university 
organization and departments 
including OASIS, Counseling 
and Psychological Services , 
the Student Center and 
Intercollegiate Athletic. 

County Council Ends Year 
Student recruitment will also 

be tudied in a task group 
subcommittee. Admi ion , the 
Registrar ' s Offi ce, EOP, 
Financial Aid , Housing, and 
the International Center will all 
come under the scrutiny of task 
group members. 

Gray says meeting the July 1 
(Plea e turn to page 13 ) Reflecting on its first full 

year of operation, the San 
Diego Co unt y Collegiate 
Council held its final meeting of 
the year Saturday in UCSD's 
North Conference Room. 

Chairman Rob DeKoven, AS 
president at San Diego State, 
began the meeting by 
pre enting his 197811979 
Assessment of SDCCC opera-
tions to a small turnout of 
campu representatives . 

DeKoven told the council that 
, he believed it was important to 
have as members of the SD CC 
all colleges and universitie in 
the San Diego area . 

Currently , ther are leven 

campuses who have active 
representatives on the council, 
with six paying full dues . 

DeKoven also fee ls there is a 
pressing need to increase 
medi a recognition of the 
council. He proposed that the 
committee hold a wine and 
chee e reception for the media, 
providing what DeKoven hopes 
will be "an opportunity for 
council members to meet 
member of the media 
personally. " 

A major recommendation 
made by DeKoven. to apply for 
non-profit tatus, met with 
unanimous upport from the 
r pre ' ntative pre ent. By 

becoming a non -profit 
organization, DeKoven and the 
SDCCC hope to receive tax 
deductible contributions of 
local businesses and cor-
porations. 

UCSD 's Adrienne Weissman, 
liaison to the Mayor's office, 
s poke after DeKoven , pre-
enting her critique of the 

mayoral liaison for 1978. " The 
job of mayoral liaison has 
become an integral part of the 

ollegiate Council ," aid 
Weis man . 

Weis man added, "it wa a 
lot of humiliation at fir t. I had 
to do a lot of political tumbling

Gang Violence 
Worries USSR 

By Nikki Finke 
Auoelated PreBB Writer 

MOSCOW - " I belong to a gang that everybody is afraid of," 
a girl from Sevastopol wrote to a Soviet newspaper. 

" We've ripped up all the playground equipment. We have a 
fight almost every night. The girls fight just as well as the boys. 
All of us have money, so liquor i no problem. We' re all known at 
the police station. 

" We've begun to wonder whether this is what we want, but 
none of us knows how to break it up. " 

The letter published in the newspaper Uteraturnaya Gazeta 
is just one example of how street gangs are becoming a fact of 
urban life in the Soviet Union, despite official craCkdowns and 
propaganda campaigns to rid the cities of these teenage toughs 
who commit crimes. 

According to Soviet statistics, 50 percent of those convicted of 
urban crimes belong to the under-30 age group. 

Sociologists blame the parents, noting that many juvenile 
delinquents come from broken homes. The Soviet press 
complains that easy access to liquor complicates the problem, 
and that if young people had somewhere more interesting to go 
at night, they wouldn't hang out at street comers or clash with 
police. 

Yet for mo,t of the teenagers, membership in a gang is a way 
of sbowlna they are "different" in a society that urges 
samen,ss. 

One ,teenager, Sharif Kbaidarov of Bukhara, was quoted as 
tellln,'a newspaper after going to jail : 

"When I entered thejail cell and saw lS-year-olds like myself, 
I wanted to cry out. I couldn't explain why I drifted into crime-
I simply thought that 'hanging out' was 'the beautiful life' I 
wanted." 

To explain the recent emergence of the gangs, Soviet officials 
often blame Western fads and influences - such as rock music 
or blue jeans - for undermlning the young people's socialist 
ideals. 

But tbe anlWer ia mucb 1nore complicated than that, 
sociologist. here say. One claims schools are "paying little 
attention to moral educalion ... As a result, young people fairly 
often suffer from moral nihilism." 

Intellectuals talk about "pustota" - the emptiness - in the . 
minds of the Soviet young which goads them to reject the law-
and-order society which their parents have created. 

Many of the Russian rowdies seem to model themselves after 
characters from the American musical "West Side Story. " 
They swagger around in black leather jackets, carry knives as 
a rule, and even give themselves nicknames like " Baldy" or 
"The Collector. " 

The gangs themselves are usually named after the city 
streets where their members grew up. 

There appears to be little trouble in attracting followers . 
Even after they are arrested, the toughs will boast during a 
court trial bow they were able to "terrorize" an entire 
neighborhood, or prevent encroachment by another gang.

Shortage Shows Flaws of 
Autoholic Dependence 

By Chris Tyndall 

I mmobility caused by gasoline shortages is of great interest and concern to many Californians these days. It does not 
matter whether this is an artificial situation 
created by oil companies, or whether reductions 
in Middle Eastern imports are the cause: the 
fact of the matter is gas prices are ridiculous, 
and lines for the purchase of gasoline a re 
horrendous. 

(Chris Tyndall is a Third College sophomore actiue in 
enuironmental concerns in Southern California.) 

Even with San Diego County 's imple· 
mentation of the "odd-even" system, there is 
still considerable congestion at many service 
stations. Southern Californians in particular are 
feeling the pinch. With the amount of driving we 
do, it is no wonder the shortage appears to be 
more seveJ:e in our part of the country. 

I hope the curreJ)t gas situation will cause 
people to view their automobiles more 
critically: as a ball and chain, rather than a 
means to independence. We have to wake up to 
the realization that automobiles are becoming 
an obsolete and harmful form of transportation. 
They cause thousands of traffic deaths a year, 
waste immense quantities of petroleum, and are 
quickly using up our clean air. 

Defenders have always claimed the 
automobile is necessary in Southern California, 
because of the vastness of developed areas here. 
In reality, the automobile is a cause of that 
sprawl, rather than an effect. The automobile 
industry has found "Southern California 
Sprawl" to be quite profitable, indeed has 
encouraged it. Why do you suppose so much of 
our money from taxes goes to improving and 
extending highways and freeways? Do you think 
the automobile industry has had anything to do 
with that? 

We have begun to think that other forms of 
, transportation are just not possible here. As 

recently as the early 196Os, parts of Orange 

Letters to the Editor 

County and most of Los Angeles County enjoyed 
a n extensive trolley system. The " Red Cars" 
made runs from all over metropolitan Los 
Angeles and Orange County into downtown. 
Most of the time, they ran at capacity. 

General Motors Company bought out the 
lines; ostensibly to replace them with "more 
efficient" bus lines. On March 31, 1963, all 
electric rail service in Metropolitan Los Angeles 
stopped. Where are those efficient hus lines 
now? Those of you who have lived in Los Angeles 
know that they do not exist. Of course, you can 
still see a Red Car. It is sitting in Seal Beach. 
fenced and immobile, a symbol olthe triumph of 
the automobile industry in Southern California. 

W e should consider the social consequences of our great dependence on 
automobiles, and the people who truly 

suffer in this situation. In these days of gas 
shortages, everyone is feeliDJ at least a little 
inconvenience. But I am more' concerned with 
people who are una ble to own automobiles in an 
automobile oriented society, people who cannot 
afford the high insurance payments, the 
maintenance costs, the gas expense, and of 
course the initial expense of owning an 
automohile. These people are restricted as to 
where they can live and the kinds of jobs they 
can have. A society where mobility depends on 
the a bility to meet the financial obligations of an 
automobile is a society that is repressive to 
certain classes of people . 

I think the need for development of alternate 
forms of transportation exists and is at a critical 
stage. I'm not saying that people should be 
forced out of their cars, but cboices should be 
available to people without cars, so they can be 
mobile, as those who have them. I also believe 
that land control legislation should be enacted to 
prevent further Southern California sprawl. 

Obviously these are simplistic, general 
solutions to a very complicated problem, but I 
hope that more people will begin thinking 
toward these ends, and that realistic and 
effective solutions will be implemented. 

Moped Theft Riles Victim 
Editor: 

I'm angry and sad and I want 
to hurt you back all at the same 
time. You destroyers and 
heartbreakers - you don't 
know what it's like to never 
have had any transportation of 
your own , no bike or 
skateboard. I know this 
because you must have had a 
car to carry my moped away in. 
You stole it because it was new 
and shiny and had only 127 
miles on it. It was shiny 
because I had polished it , never 
wanting it to look brui ed and 
battered. 

Did you think I was some rich 
kid who'd just bought a new toy 
and had it covered under 
per onal property insurance? 
You didn ' t know I aved for 

months to buy it and paid for it 
all in a lump sum because a 
loan company wouldn't give me 
credit . 

I didn 't have the money yet 
for an insurance payment and 
was waiting for my next 
paycheck. Perhaps I give you 
too much credit when I wonder 
a bout what you thought when 
you did this . Perhaps it was 
more my fault for obeying the 
laws about on-campus parking 
of motor·driven vehicles . The 
campus police told me it was 
illegal to lock my moped to a 
bike rack because there's gas in 
it and it would be a fire hazard 
parked close to a building . 
Sometimes I ignored their 
warning and locked it to a rack 
anyway . This time I chose to 

compromlse and to lock it to 
itself to prevent the rear wheel 
from turning. This time I chose 
not to take anyone's bike place. 

If there ever is a next time, I 
won't give a damn about tickets 
or courtesy or fire hazards, I 
will lock it to a rack. For now. 
while I'm waiting for buses and 
walking the streets again, I'll

at 8: 30 that morning . 

Several officers were 
immediately sent to evacuate 
the building, and with the aid of 
maintenance workers blocked 
all entrances until the building 
reopened at 8: 55 am. 

Although campus police 
employ several bomb tech-
nicians, no specialists were 
called to the scene because 
"there's no way we could check 
out the whole building in such a 
short time," according to 
oCficer Clark Martin. 

At least six a am classes were 
cancelled as a result of the 
threat. Hugh French, campus 
police chief, suggested that a 
student who wished to avoid an 
exam may have made the 
prank call, although police will 
probably be unable to discover 
the caller's identity . 

"If I had my way, we would 

never evacuate a building in a 
ca e like this ." Fren ch 
remarked . He expla ined that in 
past years no bomb threat has 
proven to be valid and that 
because of difficult security 
precautions, such threats are 
easy to make. 

Whil e entrances to the 
building were kept guarded, 
most persons at the scene 
appeared unconcerned as they 
milled near the front of the 
building and waited ' for the 
day 's routines to resume. 

Campus police received a 
similar telephoned bomb threat 
April 'n , forci ng th e evacuation 
of Revelle Cafeteria just prior 
to an evening performance of 
the controversial play ,

Dogs 'Adopted' for Experiments 
By CII .. y Beverldp 

Approximately 1300 dOls 
were adopted by the UCSD 
Animal Resource Center laat 
year for use In campus 
research and medical training, 
according to Center Manager 
Jim Morrison .. 

The Center buys the dogs for 
$9 each from the San Diego 
Animal She.lter because it is 
cheaper than purchasing dogs 
bred for research purposes, 
said Morrison. The dogs are 
selected from the assortment 

that have been picked up by the 
Shelter and not retrieved by 
owners, he said. 

Two-thirds of the dogs are 
used for medical training, 
Morrison said. Depending on 
the experiment, some of the 
dogs are anesthetized before 
being worked on. 

When the procedure is 
completed, the animals are 
either recovered temporarily 
for observation or put to sleep. 
" None of the animals leave the 
Center alive," stated Morrison. 

The number of dogs bought 

Record Number Reported 

from the Shelter by the Animal 
Resource Center is steadily 
decreasing, according to 
Morrison . In the past , 
approximately 4000 dogs were 
used annually for research 
purposes, said Morrison. 

The amount of dogs at the 
Center is not expected to 
exceed 1000 dogs this year, he 
said. 

Researchers no longer 
consider dogs an appropriate 
model for research, explained 
Morrison . Dogs were once 
valued for their organ size 

because it made the operating 
procedures easier, he said. 
" We (now) realize tha smaller 
animals, such as pigs and 
rabbits, can bejustas useful for 
the continuing education of 
doctors and nurses," said 
Morrison. 

The dogs also run a high risk 
of being health hazards 
because they are not vac-
cinated before leaving the 
Shelter, said Morrison. 

Despite the decline in the 
number of dogs used, the figure 
is high enough to provoke 
inquiry by the HumaneSociety, 
reporters and concerned 
citizens. 

Morrison. The department is 
required to submit a draft 
specifying the exact nature of 
the experiment, he said. 

The draft is then reviewed by 
physicians in the Resource 
Center, explained Morrison. 
"This is not a case of 
haphazardness . We know 
exactly what procedure will be 
used and why before the 
request is approved," he 
commented. 

Gas Siphoners Poisoned One San Diego resident, Marci Maddox, was disturbed to discover the number of stray 
dogs being used for research at 
UCSD . " Most of the students 
don't realize that when they 
lose a dog on campus, it might 
just end up on an operating 
table ," Maddox said. 

From the Shelter, the dogs 
are brought to the UCSD Eliot 
Field Station in Poway for a 
three-week period to undergo 
an examination for possible 
health deficiencies before 
coming to the Resource Center, 
according to Morrison. 

Maddox questioned the 
necessity of repeating medical 
experiments that have been 
done in the past for the sake of 
visual assurance. "I don't 
understand why once the test 
has been done it can't be 
written down and referred to 
for future study," she said. 

Many of Southern Cali-
fornia 's gas-starved drivers 
are discovering a new cause for 
alarm in their desperate 
attempts at siphoning gas -
gasoline ingestion. 

Managing Director Betts 
Wallace of the San Diego 
Poison Control Center reports a 
"new record" of calls from 
siphoners who have acci-
dentally swallowed gas. 

The usual one or two calls a 
week have increased to 100 
within a five-day period last 
week. "We are well on our way 
toward surpassing our previous 
count made during the 1974 oil 
crisis of 250 calls in one month," 
Wallace said. 

UCSD 
Drama 
Department 

Major San Diego County 
hospital emergency rooms, 
however, had no recent reports 
of accidents relating to persons 
ingesting gas while siphoning 
tanks. 

Swallowing gas can have the 
dangerous effect of producing 
chemical pneumonia and is 
extremely damaging to the 
lungs, Wallace explained. Even 
small amounts of gas can cause 
severe pain and discomfort. 

Some of the symptoms of gas 
consumption include choking, 
coughing and nausea. It can 
also be very irritating to the 
nasal passages , Wallace 
cautioned. 

" The effects of a small 

quantity of gas in the mouth 
without swallowing it aren't 
quite as noticeable," she said. 
n may result in dizziness or 
nausea but this can be relieved 
by drinking something 
soothing, such as milk. 

If minor symptoms occur 
Wallace suggested waiting for 
24-48 hours to see if they 
subside. If the symptoms 
persist, chest pain or fever may 
follow and a doctor should be 
called, she said. 

"When siphoning with 
something other than a safe 
apparatus, invariably that 
person is going to get a 
mouthful of gas, " she 
commented. Cilldy Beveridge 

Stray dogs at UCSD are 
picked up by the campus police 
and brought to the Animal 
Shelter. Encil Raines, who is 
director of three Animal 
Shelters in San Diego, 
estimated that of the 40,000 
animals picked up yearly in San 
Diego, nine out of 10 were not 
reclaimed. 

The Resource Center 
determines the number of dogs 
prochased from the Shelter by 
requests from departments in 
the med school, according to 

Morrison responded, "Like 
any class, there are some 
things that just can't be read 
about in a textbook." 

The Center's facilities are 
open to monthly inspection 
because the law authorizes 
examination of any premises 
on which animals are kept for 
experimental purposes to 
determine compliance with the 
Department of Health regu-
lations, said Morrison.

The women's softball team ended their 1979 season on a losing note last Thursday 

leuin, shut out by Point Loma. 8-0. The loss typified a season of defeats for the Triton women, wh

April 6 was the first and only time the team met victory, defeating Cal Baptist. The final re,oor'(I

Elliott attributes the team's late start at the end of February and the uncertainty as to whet

Walton Signs 7 Year 
Clippers Contract 

(AP) - The San Diego 
Clippers have signed Bill 
Walton to a seven-year contract 
at more than $800,000 a year. 
making him the highest-paid 
pl:lyer in the ational 
Ba ketball Associa.tion, the 
team announced yesterday . 

Ral Childs, the Clipper 's 
publicity director, sa id the 26-
year-old Walton would join the 
team roster a fter the last 
playoff game of this season and 
would tart for the Clipper in 
the fall. 

Walton . who had been the 
mainstay of the Portland Trail 
Blazers, at out this season with 
a foot injury. He had disagreed 
sharply with Trail Blazers 
management over use of pain-
killing drugs and has been 
shopping for a new team for 
more than a year. 

In Portland, Harry Glick-
man , the Trail Blazers ' 
executive vice president and 
general manager, said, " Bill 
Walton is the most valuable 

player in the NBA , and we 
expect to be compensated 
accordingly ... 

He added. " Bill 's decision to 
play inSan Dicgoobviously wa 

. not for financial reasons as 
Portland was prepared to 
match or exceed any offer 
Walton received." 

Glickman said Wal ton m t 
with Blazer ' owner Larry 
Weinberg in Lo Angele abou t 
10 days ago and to ld him he had 
elected a doctor to be his 

agent. He said Walton told 
Weinberg that the doctor would 
be in touch with him in a few 
days to discuss a contract but 
that there was no meeting. 

" We're disappointed they 
didn ' t keep their word ," 
Glickman said. 

Childs said Walton , who 
graduated from Helix High 
School in nearby La Mesa, was 
planning to buy a home in the 
San Diego area . Childs sa id 
detail of the contract would be 
announced later.

Tritons Last of 3 
In UC Badmint'n 
Berkeley Dominates Tourney 

By Stan Honda 
UC Berkeley's powerful 

badminton team came to San 
Diego last weekend and swept 
the AII·Cal tournament, easily 
deCeating UC DaVIS and host 
UCSD. The final tally [or the 
three teams was Berkeley 51, 
Davis 18 and San Diego 17. 

The tournament was 
dominated by Berkeley, to the 
extent of having teammates 
compete Cor the singles finals . 
The number four and number 
one players, L. Cay ford and 
Roger Tong, met in the men's 
finals with Cayford coming out 
ahead in two sets. Women's 
singles was won by A. 
Gutierrez, who deCeated her 

teammate from Berkeley, 11-1 , 
11-2. 

Although the Tritons did not 
fair well overall, two 
individuals survived until the 
quarter finals, Linda Fried, in 
the number one women 's 
position, won three or four 
matches before losing in the 
quarters. Her second opponent ' 
and first los wa against 
Gutierrez, who eventually took 
the singles title. 

Men Win in Crew Invitational 

After a bye in the first round, 
Hal Jacobs , the number one 
men's singles, lost to Cayford of 
Berkeley, then beat teammate 
Mark Standlee. His next match 
was against Tong, who got the 
victory when Jacobs had to 
forfeit due to leg muscle 
cramps. All the singles 
matches were double elim· 
ination while the doubles were 
round robin.

Two men's boats from UCSD 
won the battle against Mission 
Bay waterskiers, an incoming 
tide and boats from four other 
schools to take firsts in 
Saturday's San Diego Invi-
tational crew regatta. 

The men 's lightweight eight, 
trailing Santa Clara with ISO 
meters remaining in a 200 
meter race, caught them and 
beat them by about two feet at 
the finish line. At the finish, 
"we were striding and they 
were gliding," according to 
Coach Jack Vallerga, giving 
the Triton boat the small edge 
that put them over the line first. 

Tbe men's freshmen eight 
teamed for their first win of the 
season, edging out Santa Clara 

also. Four frosh rowers beat 
Long Beach last month for the 
only other freshman win oC 
1979. 

This weekend's tropical 
weather posed a hazard for the 
five schools at the meet, 
because it brought San Diego's 
waterskiers swarming to the 
bay Saturday. The first half of 
the course, in the northern end 
of Mission Bay, is also the ski 
zone. Neither the rowers nor 
the skiers were willing to give 
up their territory, and that 
"gave the crews a great deal oC 
trouble," according to 
Vallerga. 

If anything, the hazard gave 
UCSD, SDSU, and USD an edge 
in their races over visiting 
schools Long Beach State and 
Santa Clara, because the San

Diego schools knew what to 
expect from the skiers. Yet all 
schools had to row against the 
same water skiers, and the 
same outgoing 'tide, so their 
times were all relatively slow. 

The home advantage didn 't 
affect the men's heavyweight 
race, since the two State boats 
and the Triton boat were all 
racing on their home course . 
The UCSD Cour took second, but 
Cclt it was their best race oC the 
season. 

The women's novice crew 
emerged as the clear San Diego 
area champion, beating USD 
for the third time this season, 
beating State Cor the second 
time, but losing to Long Beach. 
At a disadvantage because all 
of their girls are classified as 

lightweights, the women 's open 
boat took third in their race 
behind Long Beach and SDSU. 

Vallerga was pleased to see 
his crews place as well as they 
did, because the meet was the 
last competition before this 
weekend's Intercollegiate 
Championships in the Bay 
Area . " That was a good 
preparatory race," he said, 
"and it's nice not to have to 
travel. " 

Most of the Triton's hopes lie 
with the lightweight eight crew 
that won Saturday's race and 
took fourth in last month's 
prestigious Crew Classic . 
Beating their rival Santa Clara 
two days ago could have an 
influence on how they perform 
Saturday.

UCSD Coach Mike Vander 
Griend said he had no idea what 
Berkeley or Davis would be 
like. 

" We had no scouting reports 
on either team," said Vander 
Griend, "All we had heard was 
that Berkeley was very good." 

The Tritons played "a little 
flat," according to the coach, 
adding that they could have 
played a little tougher. But 
Vander Griend noted that 
Berkeley was beating both 
Davis and San Diego evenly. 

He and assistant coach David 
Briggs stressed that UCSD's 
season was over two week ago 
and the long layoff may have 
had an effect on the team's 
play. Briggs added that this 
tournament may not have 
meant much to the players, 
being after league play 
finished.

Rachel Sue Sweet is 16 years 
old and she knows it, but she 
doesn't let it s tand in her way. 
She wants to be a famous pop

Rachel doesn't want a ny part of

is just a fad .. .I 'm only 16 and fa r

you know she's in control, 
supremely confident of her

to project the vulnera bility the 
song ca lls for. Her vocals have

Rachel isn' t as good as Aretha

and a means with which to 
create dramatic ef(ect . Mr. 
Robinson clearly understands 
this and handles it well , 
stressing the inherent comedy 
of the discourse. 

The acting in the Curse of the 
Starving Class is consistently 
good , UCSD 's Lisa Wolpe 
makes a fine punk of a thirteen-
year-old, while Ken Wright, as 
her brother, delivers a very 
impressive epic poetic account

The set is a little too right 
angular. for my tastes, 
c haracterized by the un re·

objects on the stage, and the 
painterly . realism of the 
barnyard scene scrim in the 
back contradicts the spare 
representationalism of the 
oppressively rectangular house 
with no front door . . 

Overall , however, the Curse 
of the Starving Class is well 
worth seeing. 1 don't think the

record ed li ve last year in 
Japa n, is further evidence of 
his tylistic revision . Here 
Dylan dips into his catalogue of 
songs and revamps some of his 
most famous tunes in radical 
ways. Hi new approach is 
appa ren t in the overall sound of 
the LP <.IS well--this i the most 
carefull y recorded and mixed 
Dylan album ever released. 
Unlike on his previous live 
album , Dylan isn't forced to 
hout over his backup band to 

be heard; his raspy voice is 
br ought up fro nt on each song. 

Th o u g h a pastic h e o f 
numerous sounds c<.In be heard 
on Budokan , Dyla n' s most 
recogniza ble influence seems 
to be the rock/ soul blend of such 
ar t is ts as Bruce Springsteen. 
More often than not he pulls this 
style off, particula rly when he 
applies it to his slower, moodier 
tunes . The s inister lyrics of 
" Ba lla d Of A Thin Man," for 
exa mple, lend themselves we ll 
to the slinky nightclub version 
Dylan's group offers here. A 
nappy rhumba piano/conga 

a r ra ngement on " One More 
Cup Of Coffee (Valley Below) " 
a lso proves effective. 

Severa l of the more upbeat 
se lections a re also redone with 

flair. " All ] Really Want To 
Do," a tune rrom Dyla n's folk· 
singer d ays , is given a 
refreshing bounce by deft 
counte rpointing a thumping 
base a nd honking s<.Ixophonc 
against a twinkling ma ndolin. 
The arrang ment has more in 
com mon with Cher Bono 's 
cover of the song than Dylan's 
original. but it neverthcle s 
works. Another favorite of 
minc here is " Love Minus Zero / 
No Limit. " an absurdist ballad 
given neW sparkle by interplay 
or violi n, rtute, a nd electric 
keyboards . The effect is genia l, 
effervescent and, [or Dylan, 
definitely offbeat. 

Dy la n's song customizing 
doesn' t a lways succeed. At 
times he juggles too many 
instruments and ruins a song 
w ith a po or ly -co nceive d 
interpreta tion. Some of his 
composit ions were meant to 
always be done as simple folk 
s ongs , no t ho ke d-up p ro-

Hefner: Liberal Cheek 
No Sale 

"Perfect fit, yeah, perfect fit, best fit rve had all day .... " 
Robert Marx ran his thumbs under the lapels of the suit he was 

trying on and looked at himaelf in the three-sided mirror while the 
salesman, someone named "Victor" from what the card on his 
shirt pocket read, stood to ODe side with a cloth measuring tape 
around his neck and his bands in his pocket. His tongue nervously 
wetted his lips. 

"Yeah, this suit looks real bip ... just the thing I need for that 
interview .. .. .. 

I had never realized until last Monday night how important a role the. 
publisher of Playboy magazine 
has played in changing the face 
of American society, 

In the last two-and-a-half 
decades Hugh Hefner has 
almost single- handedly 
advanced the cause of civil 
rights, ended the war in 
Vietnam and engineered the 
women's liberation movement. 
Or at least that ' s the 
impression I received from 
Playboy's 25th Anniversary 
Celebration, which aired May 
7th on ABC television. 

Playboy'. %Sill was the most 
blatant piece of propaganda I'd 
seen on TV in a long time -
aside from the Sam Yony 
SIIow, of course (Sundays, 8 
pm, Ch. 13) . The program 
glorified Hefner as a champion 
of liberal ideas , a con-
temporary thinker who works 
mental miracles through his 
"Playboy Philosophy" - a self-

serving doctrine equating 
"sexual rights" with human 
rights, a pathetic attempt to 
justify the ,existence and 
success of Playboy, 

The depiction of women as 
sex objects (the real reason for 
Playboy's existence and 
success) was possibly the least 
offensive aspect of the show -I 
would have thought ABC could 
have done much better (Le., 
worse) . More objectionable 
were segments from the 
syndicated After Dark TV 
series, which few watched 
(television not being as 
"liberated" as the print 
media). That show had a 
cocktail party format, with Hef 
hosting some of bis weIl-
dressed liberal hipster friends. 
The entertainment included 
jazz notables Dizzy Gillespie 
and Ella Fitzgerald and "sick" 
comedian Lenny Bruce, who 
were accustomed to con-
descending attitudes and 

seemed to fit in, and archetypal 
hippies Country Joe and the 
Fish, who weren't and didn't. If 
any of them had had any sel(· 
respect left, they could have at 
least punched their host in the 
face. 

But the worst insult was to the 
women ' s movement. Af ter 
defending himself (uncon-
vincingly) from an attack by 
ardent feminists, Hefner 
proudly trumpeted his support 
of NOW and the ERA, saying he 
supported all facets of the 
movement except the "anti· 
sexual" ones. Adding injury to 
insUlt, this segment was used as 
a prelude to the program's 
finale, the announcement of the 
"25th Anniversary Playmate," 
Oklahoma coed Candy Loving 
("her real name is Candice 
Loving" - suuuure) . Ms . 
LoviOl, as far as I could tell, 
had only two assets, though 
these were certainly (as Her 
himself put it) "formidable." 

The salesman took his hands from his pocket and tried to crack 
hi. knuckles quietly as Robert stepped closer for a better three-
sided inspection 1)f the clothes. Since be loved looldng at himself as 
he thought others saw him in the street, be stood more erect so that 
the coat could hang better. From behind the jacket and pants 
looked okay, the sUt in the tails bangiOl just right over the seat of 
his pants, loose-fitting vanilla slacks that Robert thought made his 
ass look a little more svelte than the bacIY jeans be wore most of 
the days of the week. except Saturdays. He needed a haircut, he 
thought, as he studied the way his locks cascaded in lazy, 
directlonless waves over the shirt collar and over the back of the 
lapel. Very funky. he determined. 'I1Ie front view looked better. 
thoUlh. Tbe pants. jacket, shirt and vest were a series of straight 
lines in perfect proportion to each other. Only the tie was askew. 
Robert tied it hurriedly in the dreuiDl room and the haphazard 
knot made the cloth buncb up in an unnaly mea. Fortunately. the 
vest covered the unevenness, the tblck portion bei ... a good three 
inches shorter than the skiony strand. Robert stepped back and 
produced a 1001 sigh and looked at the salesman, whose eyes, wide 
with hope, widened even more, beyond hopefulness to a 
resignation of his fate . No sale. 

Around Town 
"Yeah, like I said, I really like the suit ... butI'm ,onna have to ,0 

to the bank and check my balance, and In'm cooI,l'lI be back in an 
hour." 

The salesman nodded and cbecked bis watch after Robert 
turned towards the dressing room. 5: 30. The store closed in 
another half-hour and most of the banks in the area closed at 4: 30. 
He went over to the cash register and began to shift throu,h a pile 
of invoices he bad to process. He pulled his pen from his shirt 
pocket and began to write somethiDl on the back of an invoice 
when he looked up and saw Robert, stiI1 in the suit he had tried on, 
walking toward the rear exit to the parking lot. Robert looked back 
before he reached the door and saw the salesman looking at him. 
His face went blank. He turned back around. broke into a run and 
bounded through the door like someone finishing first in a foot 
race. He knocked over an old woman in a grey raincoat who'd been 
carrying packages. The packages scattered all over thesidewalk. 
The saleman dropped his pen and ran outside after him. The old

Genes Pass Tay-Sachs Force

Tuv-sachs disease. though 
pds.'c d genetica ll~ from 
ht'ncl'Lltion to generatIOn, and 
thuS " incurable," can be 
illo ided. 

Ca using suc h sy mptoms as

deli ms early in life, resulting 

Tay-Sachs 
Test Today 

Free T ay-sachs disease 
testi ng will be available at 
UCS D beginning today through 
Thursday. 

The testing, under the 
auspices of the UCSD Medical 
Cente r a nd the Uni-Jewish 
Federation of San Di ego, will 
take place as follows : 

May 14 - Why Not Here 
(Revelle), 9 am-5 pm; May 15 
- Why Not Here (Revelle) , 9 
am-5 pm; May 16 - Cloud' s 
Rest (Muir}'9am-5pm; May 17 

Cloud's Rest , 9 am-l pm; and 
17 - Winzer Commons (at 

med school) , 2 pm -7 pm. 
A core group of students and 

vol untee rs who helped 
coo rdinate the Tay-sachs 
program will be present at the 

s ting sites to answer 
. ques'liOJls and provide genetic 

ing for those interested. 
About 750 people were tested 

campus last year and the 
for this year is 1000. 

in death at the age of about 
th ree or four years . 

Occurring a bout six times 
more often among Jews a nd 
people of Middle-Eastern 
des ent than any oth r group, 
Tay -sachs i caused by a 
combination of two recessive 
genes at conception. This union 
results in a disorder of fat 
metabolism, as a fat-digesting 
e nz yme normally prese nt 
wi thin the cell is not produced. 
F a t - lik e s ub sta n ces are 
deposited in tissues of the body, 
specifically those of the central 
ne r vous system, ca u si ng 
cellul ar deterioration a nd 
eventua lly, severe menta l 
deficiency . 

Because the Tay-sachs gene 
is recessive, a person m ay have 
one such gene and yet not be 
affected , This type of person is 
ca lled a carrier. 

If only one parent is a carrier, 
statistics show that there is a 50 
percent chance that each child 
will also be a carrier. However, 
because there was only one 
Tay-sachs gene in the union, 
none of the oCCspring will be 
afflicted with the disease. 

Should both parents be 
carriers, though, the chances 
are 25 percent that each child 
will have Tay-sachs, 

The child with Tay-sachs 
disease will be extremely 
sensitive to noise a nd will show 
weakness in the muscles. A 
noticeable loss of vision will 
progress to the point of 
blindness and the child will 
most often die between the ages 

of three and five years , 
Testing for thc pl'esence of 

the Tay-si]('hs disease is a 
rel;J ti vely simple process. A 
mall ample of blood is drawn 

from the person and tested to 
determi ne the level of the fat-
digesting enzyme present. The 
amount of enzyme is an 
indicator of whether or not the 
person is a carrier. 

Pregnant women can also 
undergo a test to determi ne if 
their child will be a Tay-sachs 
child. A needle is used to 
remove a sample of the 
a mniotic fluid - the liquid 
inside the membrane sac 
surrounding the fetus. The fluid 
can then be analyzed to show if 
Tay-sachs is present. Unlike 
the blood test, ijJis " amnio-
centosis" cannot demonstrate 
whether the unborn child will 
be a carrier, but in'stead tells 
the pa rents when they are 
carrying a child which will 
definitely have Tay-sachs 
disease , 

Crew Win 
(Continued from page1) 

" The manner in which we 
beat them is important too," 
said their coach. " Because we 
beat them from behind. It 
should be a good shot in the arm 
for the crew. They're believing 
in themselves." 

The freshmen can expect 
much stronger competition up 
north than at Saturday ' s 
race. 

deadlin e is almost a n 
impossibility, but adds that " it 
(the Jlily I deadline) is 
necessa ry if you are going to 
have any effect on the budget 
next year." 

ubcommittees will go about 
meeting thei r objectives by 
"obtaining sl.i,lffing lists a nd 
depa rtm ent a l procedure s . 
Then they will review budget 
figures a nd disc uss a pparent 
weaknesses with depa rtmental 
personnel ," sai d Gray. 
Economizing, " though im-
portant," said Gray, " will not 
be a major consideration." 

He declined comment on the 
long term effects of the task 
group study. 

Dylan 
Slick 
(Continued from page 11) 
Las Vegas phoniness is a fine 
one. Dylan, still learning how to 
handle his expanded band, 
sometimes crosses it in the 
wrong direction. 

Those fans still enamored 
with the spareness of Dylan's 
early LPs will be profoundly 
disturbed by the Budokan 
album. Me, I get a kick out of 
hearing his imaginative new 
treatments of old hits and try to 
skip over the fumbled efforts. 
Until he cuts bis disco single 
with the Village People, I'll 
grant Dylan the right to play 
the 70 's Superstar.

they ' re not neces ary," 

Laga , who I d th vending 
machine task force, says tha t 
the vending issue is an exa mple 
oC st udent s influenci ng 
decisi ons. 

" Student Affairs Vice 
Chancellor Richard Armitage 
apologized to me two weeks ago 
about the vending decision. 
When the funds were trans-
ferred , he just didn't know that 
students would object because 
he was new here. By making 
ourselves known, we got the 
decision changed," Laga says,

toward low cost housing, in 
addition to the other issues like 
busing," she says, 

Student lobbying efforts have 
already been very successful, 
Laga says, pointing to 
development around campus. 
"University Towne Centre was 
going to be three times the size 
it is now. Though we weren' t 
entirely successful, student 
lobbyists got a more accepta ble 
result," she says.

Marijuana Act No News in Berkeley 
Despite Outside Media, 
Measure Changes Little 
By Trapper Byrne 

SpedaI &0 &be Guardlu 
Berkeley - When the New 

York Times, CBS News, and the 
Los Angeles Timet all cover an 
issue in this city of hippies, 
student riots and a number of 
other charming stereotypes, 
one might think that the 
citizens of Berkeley themselves 
would be up in arms over it. 

Such is not the case, however, 
with the recently passed , 
famous Measure C, the 
Berkeley Marijuana Initiative. 
Talk to anyone in Berkeley 
about it, and if he's polite, he'll 
stifle the yawn. 

The initiative, which passed 
by a margin of slightly less than 
2-1 April 17, has been widely 
reported as "legalizing' 
marijuana" in Berkeley . 
Actually, it directs Berkeley 
and University of California 
police to assign "lowest 

. priority" to marijuana law 
enforcement, and states that 
the Berkeley police will not be 
paid for the time they spend 
making marijuana-re lated 
arrests. . 

City Manager Michael 
Lawson recently said the 
initiative is merely "a 
restatement of current police 
department policy." He noted 
that in 1978 police issued only 59 

citations for marijuana 
possession and use in this city of 
HO,OOO, and that many of those 
were cases in which marijuana 
was found on people arrested 
for other crimes. 

In a purely random, highly 
unscientific sampling of 
Berkeley residents conducted 
last week, not one respondent 
had noticed any change in 
marijuana enforcement. "You 
could set up a stand on Shattuck 
Avenue selling slabs of 
Lebanese hash," one said, " and 
I doubt the Berkeley police 
would give a damn. It 's the C 
cops you have to watch out for ," 
he said. 

Even the UC police, however, 
seem to be abiding by the 
restrictions set by the 
initiative. Police citations for 
marijuana use , which were 
averaging about three a day 
before the election , have 
dropped to nothing in the last 
two weeks. 

Not everyone has grown 
complacent about police. 
enforcement of marijuana 
laws, however. One distributer 
of cannabis with a long history 
of paranoia said in an interview 
he is not ., about to go outside 
and 'Offer to sell some shit to the 
Berkeley cops. They'd bust me 
like that, " he said, clicking his

When it come right down to it, 

though, the Berkeley Mari-
juana Initiative is a little like 
homegrown marijuana . You 
know and your close friends 
know that it's ragweed, but you 
can always sell it to ignorant 
slobs who don't know you as 
Coiumbian Gold. 

Measure C was strictly for 
show, a false issue that 
everyone in Berkeley ignored 
as ragweed but the national 
press sold to the Amer\can 
public as Columbian Gold. It 
was presented as another 
product of rad-lib Berkeley, the 
Freak capital of the Land of

Anyone who has lived around 
the Berkeley campus for two 
weeks knows that this person is 
the guy who sits in the doorway 
of Southside Books on Durant 
Avenue off Telegraph , 
screaming at pa sers-by to 
" stop stepping on my dog." Of 
course, he has no dog, but

Had it not been for the equally 
well -publicized marijuana 
"win a kilo" raffle, no one in 
Berkeley would even hav 
known the Marijuana Initiativ 
was ever on the ballot. Voting 
for marijuana in Berkeley i 
not , as one Measure 
supporter put it , "like voting 
for mom and apple pie." It 's 
more like voting for j ay-

to do it, but everyone do . 
anyway .
