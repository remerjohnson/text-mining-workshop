The University of California ' s contro-
versial seven-month-old "fighting words" 
student conduct policy will face it first test 
ever in the UC system at UCSD. 

Student Conduct Coordinator Nick 
Aguilar acknowledged he has recently proc-
essed and reviewed a case, and has passed 
on the complaint to the dean of the accu ed 
student's college. 

Aguilar aid he see the test case as a 
'positive development." 

"[With a precedent], the UC community 
can have clear guidance to know what i free 
speech and what is not free speech when a 
compelling state intere t is involved," 

See WORDS, page 7 According to a letter from Third College 
Provo t Cecil Lytle read by Vice President 
Admini trative pro Tern Ruben Duran, the 
decision to rename the I,;ollege and buildings 
is pending di cus ion with Third College 
students.

Martin Luther King College was the most 

popular choice in a Third College referen-

on the ballot. Faustina Solis, the other name

UCSD Equipment in Space 
Telescope Flies on Shuttle 

The Hubble Space Telescope, a telescope containing an instrument which was 
designed and constructed at UCSD, went into space Tuesday in the cargo bay of the 
space shuttle Discovery as it lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. 

Several members ofUCSO's Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, which 
helped design the Faint Object Spectograph (FOS), watched the launch Tuesday 
morning via a live satellite feed from a NASA satellite. 

The other members of the team observed the shuttle launch from Goddard Space 
Hight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, where they have been conducting remote 
operating simulations of the telescope for the last six months in preparation for its 
launch. 

The FOS was designed to detect the physical state and chemical composition of 
very faint objects, such as quasars, at the fringes of the observable universe. Astrono-
mers say that the data gathered by the telescope will help them gauge the age and fate 
of the universe. 

The re olving power of the telescope has been compared to the ability to 
distinguish a car's right headlight from its left at a distance of 2,500 miles. The FOS 
will also be able to distinguish the type of filament used in the headlight by chemical 
analysis through light spectrum analysis procedures. 

The FOS weighs about 700 pounds and is about the size of a telephone booth. 
Designers compare the overall size of the telescope to that of a passenger bus. 

The telescope had originally been slated to go into orbit in 1986, but after the 
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, it was mothballed in a dust-free "clean 
room." The telescope was removed from the room six months ago. 

The UCSD team developed all the software and hardware for controlling and 
gathering data from the FOS: The data will be gathered at Goddard Flight Center. 

The team of engineers and programmers from UCSD will remain at the mission 
operations center at Goddard for 90 day after the launch to direct the "orbital 
verification" of the instrument, to make sure that the telescope i properly aligned in 
space. After thi i done, the telescope will begin to perfonn its mission. 

for drugs in a lecture at the Price Center on 
Tuesday. 

Margain began by discussing a 1988 U.N. 
conference in Vienna focusing on the world-
wide drug problem that was attended by 160 
nations. The conference culminated in the 
signing of a treaty, and then discussion 
ensued on where to place the blame for the 
international drug problem. 

Margain, who represented Mexico at that 
conference, said it was the first time the 
major powers of the world "agreed that the 
production, consumption, and trafficking 
[of drugs] is a link that we cannot separate." 
Before this point, he aid, there was no 
commitment to a crackdown on drug con-
sumption. 

Margain argued that his country is not to 
blame for drug problems in America. 

"The war is in the U.S., not in Mexico," 
he continued. "It is the cities of the U.S. 
where drug traffickers control too much ter-
ritory ." 

Margain went on to point out the hypoc-
risy in blaming Mexico for drug traffic when 
California itself is one of the major produc-
ers of marijuana in the world. He al 0 ug-
gested that the American drug culture is re-
inforced by Hollywood production and pub-
lications such as High Times magazine. 

Using a conciliatory tone. Margain re-
peatedJy said that Mexico was "very will-
ing" to cooperate in the fight again t drug 
trafficking. He said he could not understand 
why Mexico' conduct has been continuaJly 
reprimanded by American pre idents. 

"The [U.S.] executive power has aid. 
every year, 'I am not pleased with Mexican 
conduct,' "he aid. 

America' first oven attack on the Mexi-
can drug trade, "Operation Intercept," oc-
curred in 1969 under Pre ident Richard 
Nixon. The operation attempted to eaJ off 

American borders to drugs. The failure of 
this attempt led to "Operation Coopera-
tion," a bilateral agreement which Margain 
helped forge that allowed American drug 
experts to work in Mexico. 

"Since then the Drug Enforcement 
Agency has been working in Mexico," 
Margain said. 

He was quick to point out that Mexico is 
a overeign nation and will not tolerate 
intervention. 

"We are again t Drug Enforcement 
Agency (DEA) agents working in Mexico," 
Margain aid. He added that Mexican law is 
often violated during U.S . crackdowns on 
suspected drug traffickers. 

Margain discus ed a recent uproar in 
Mexico involving a Guadalajaran gynecolo-
gist, Humberto Alvarez Marchain, who was 
detained on April 2 without a warrant, alleg-
edly for drug involvement. and had his house 
broken into. Marchain was then brought to 
El Paso, Texas. 

According to Margain, Mexican authori-
ties want Marchain back. Margain aid that 
detaining Marchain without a warrant i a 
violation of both the American and Mexican 
con titutions. 

Instead of DEA agent â€¢ Margain ug-
gested that a more active role for the U.S. 
would be to provide Mexico with technical 
help and advice but leave the prosecution of 
drug dealers to Mexican authoritie . 

"In tead of a bilateral under tanding. it ' 
much better to have a multilateral under-
tanding ... let u call UN e pert ," he aid. 

Margain went on to call for the help of 
bank in expo ing money gained through 
drug . He criticized the practice of bank 
ecrecy which, he aid. allow drug king-

pin to launder money through anonymou 
bank account .

UCR Moves Closer to Rec Facility 

RIVERSIDE- Members ofUC Riverside's Recrea-
tion Facility Referendum Committee have arrived at a 
final proposal for a recreation facility referendum, to be 
voted on by UCR students in elections on May 8-9. 

The proposal, introduced by ASUCR External Presi-
pent John Leyman and passed by the board last Wednes-
day, suggests the formation of a student governing board, 
consisting of three undergraduates and three graduate

students appointed by the AS UCR and the UCR Graduate 
Student Association. 

]n addition, Leyman's proposal suggests the appoint-
ment of a full-time, salaried director for the facility. The 
director would be an employee of ASUCR, but would 
report directly to the governing board. 

While student committee members supported hiring a 
director, university administrators were hesitant, instead 
favoring placing the Recreation and Intramural Depart-
ment in charge of the facility . 

The May referendum on the facility will not simply be 
a yes/no vote. Students who vote in favor of the facility 
will then vote for either a $59 per quarter fee increase or 
a $69 per quarrer fee increase. Students would begin 
paying in the fall of 1993, when the facility is scheduled 
to open. 

UCSB Fraternity Members Charged 
With Singing Violent, Sexist Songs 

SANTA BARBARA - Approximately 70 students 
rallied in front of UCSB' Phi Sigma Kappa house las 
Wednesday morning, charging that a collection of songs 
linked to the chapter promised "blatant glorification of 
rape and violence against women." 

Three women called a press conference in front of the 
chapter to expose songs that they claimed were used by 
the UCSB fraternity, but Phi Sig members have denied 
that the songs are theirs. 

"It 's slander, is basically what it is," Phi Sig Vice 
President Mike Jacoby said. 

Protest organizers said they did not intend to single out 
the fraternity, but hoped to make an example of the 
ideologies perpetuated in the Greekcommunity and force 
the university to address the matter. 

The songs in question included the stanza: "He got up 
from the desert floor and gave that bitch a wack [sic]/and 
with his trusty cowboy boot he kicked her in the crack/he 
pistle [sic] whipped her once or twice and shit in both her 
eye's [sic)/the moral of the story is DON'T FUCK WITH 
PHI SIG GUYS!" 

Fraternity members complained ofbeing attacked when 
they feel that they are not solely to blame. 

"Guys get singled OUt for this, being sexist. But the 
whole serenade thing, it's not that sorority songs are void 
of certain connotations, but basically it's on both sides. 
Traditionally, guys take the brunt of the abuse," Phi Sig 
member Dustin Salem said. 

"1 think the sorority songs are much moreexplicil," Phi 
Sig affiliate member Sam Levitz said.

'Study Abroad' Story Response 
In an April 23 Guardian article , information abow the Education Abroad Program (EAP) alld the 

Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) may have been misinterpreted. Bill Clabby,an OAP adviser quoted 
in the story, made a statemem about the situation of study abroad credits at UCSD: 

As adviser at OAP, [ am concerned that students were left with the wrong impre sion after reading the 
article, "Study Abroad Leads to Lessened Credits for Some UCSD Students." 

The article begins with a frightening statement that "many students who study abroad" have trouble 
getting academic credit for their classes. What the author of this article wanted to convey was that by 
working with our office we can prevent this from happening to many students. 

We send several hundred students abroad each year on both the UC- ponsored EAP and OAP programs. 
In the caseofEAP, students earn UC credit, which means grades earned abroad figure into the UCSD GPA, 
although we require that they consult with major, minor, and college advisor to arrange for credit toward 
specific requirements. 

With OAP programs, virtually every one of the students who come to our office seeking credi t have that 
credit approved. We have them present their proposed program of study to an admissions adviser, a de-
partment adviser, an academic adviser, and a financial aid adviser where applicable as part of the pre-
departure process. III this way, they know their options and can find solutions before going abroad . 

We want to be sure students are aware of the services offered by our office, and take full advantage of 
them. We faci li tate credit transfer, and the use of financial aid while abroad for tho e who qualify. Our 
country-specific and general pre-departure orientations help students prepare and finalize their plans along 
with giving them the opportunity to talk to student returnees from the country to which they are going. 
While abroad, we send students a quarterly newsletter with pertinent UCSD information and necessary 
documents. And to ease reentry to UCSD we assist with T-Reg so they will not lose their standing in signing 
up for classes upon returning, and waive the normal $40 readmission fee if they will be gone more than 
one quarter. 

We also facilitate short-term work abroad and internships abroad for credit through our office. 
If you see an ad in the newspaper for study abroad or if you want to find out more, call the Opportunities 

Abroad Office (534-1123), visit OUI office, or come to our Resource Library at the International Center. 
The story referred to the EAP office as the EOP (Equal Opportunity Program) office. EOP has no 

affiliation with either EAP or OAP. The Guardian regrets the error. 

Apologies to 
Dr. Stuart Zola-Morgan 

The UCSD Guardian's 
advertising policy d ictates 
that no ad will be pub-
lished if the content of an 
ad attacks an individual. 

On April 23, The Guard-

Cheating 

Unfair Inconsistencies 
What happens to a student accused of cheating? That is a 

difficult question at UCSD. According to the Student Handbook, 
the student can only be failed for the assignment which he 
cheated on. But according to Academic Senate policy, instructors 
can give the student an "F" for the entire course. 

To make matters worse, the vast majority of students have 
never seen the Student Handbook. Legal Services has a copy, and 
there are probably a few more around campus - but there are 
certainly far fewer Student Handbooks than students. 

If a student is caught cheating, he is informed of the infraction 
and punishment is proposed by the dean of the student's college. 
The student then has 10 days to protest the judgment. 

Both the discrepancy in policy and the appeal process need to 
be fixed. The problem is that a student who has no intention of 
cheating can be accused of it. 

Perhaps the accusation is mistaken. Or perhaps the student 
actually is not completely innocent. But often it is difficult to tell 
what a professor considers cheating. Is it cheating to tum to 
someone next to you in the computer lab and ask what a certain 
command 's parameters are? Is that "collaboration"? This isn't a 
clear black and white issue. 

But one thing is clear: An accusation of cheating can haunt a 
student for his entire academic career, and beyond. This issue 
needs to be handled with much more finesse. 

The appeals process should be automatic: A student should 
receive a hearing unless he requests not to have one. The student 
should not be presumed guilty. Also, the punishment should be 
failure only on the assignment the student allegedly cheated on . 
Copying a final should be dealt with more harshly than asking 
another student for help on a homework problem. 

Cheating is a serious offense and should not be tolerated. But 
because of its seriousness, it must be handled carefully, with 
protection for the falsely accused and reasonable handling of 
students who are in the gray area between proper behavior and 
cheating. 

Most of all, the policy should be consistent, and students 
should be informed of its implications. 

Animal Rights 

Unreasoning Emotion 
Last Monday, April 23, an advertisement ran in the Guardian 

paid for by a group called "San piego Animal Advocates." 
There's nothing wrong with a group buying an ad to espouse its 
point of view and to publicize a demonstration, but in this case the 
ad went too far. It attacked a UCSD scientist by name, and 
claimed his "experiments offer no benefit to human health." 
Accompanying the ad was a photograph of cuddly baby monkeys 
in a cage. 

The issue of animal rights is a complex ethical issue. Try this 
thought experiment: If you had to choose between a person dying 
and a monkey, which would you choose? What about two 
monkeys? 50? 500? It is impossible to weigh human life against 
those of animals . 

Detennining what rights animals have requires a great deal of 
thought and debate. Both sides are entrenched, and are not even 
talking compromise. More stringent oversight may be necessary 
for animal research, and perhaps some experimentation should 
be banned . 

But is this ad the right way to accomplish it? Are personal 
attacks on a scientist helpful? More importantly , appealing to 
emotion rather than reason may serve the animal rights 
movement's short tenn goals ( in this case, getting people to the 
demonstration), but it doesn't help in the long tenn . 

Emotional attacks bordering on libel have no place in a debate 
on such an important issue. The San Diego Animal Advocates 
should be ashamed of themselves. 

Animal Advertisement Was Despicable 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to an 
ad placed in the April 23 GuardialJ 
by San Diego Animal Advocates. 
an animal righls group. Let me say 
first that I respect the editors' right 
to publish any ad they want, re-
gardless of its content. 

As a graduate student doing bi-
omedical research, however, I do 
not respect the people who wrote 
the ad and paid for it. I find per-
sonal attacks despicable, and this 
one more so since Dr. Zola-Mor-
gan has not been singled out be-
cause of any flaws in his research, 
but because of his vocal defense 
of the need for animal research in 
order to save human lives. 

The ad is, in fact, a prime ex-
ample of how the animal rights 
movement tries to appeal to 
people's emotions by lying and 
distorting the truth. 

To begin with, the picture 
shows four infant monkeys hud-
dling together, contradicting the 
text which says "monkeys sit 
alone, awaiting their fate." More-
over, that picture was not taken at 
UCSD. and certainly has no rela-
tionship to Dr. Zola-Morgan's 
work at UCSD. since he has not 
used infant monkeys. 

It also has very little relation-
ship to most other animal research 
at UCSD. since a vast majority of 
it is done on rats and mice. As to 
the text, Its allegations that re-
searchers make large amounts of 
money and their experiments do 
not benefit human health are to-
tally untrue; a researcher at a 
medical school earns much less 
than a comparably qualified phy-
sician. 

The truth is, people choose this 
career because without animal 
research, there would be no polio 
vaccine, the survival rate for in-
fantile leukemia would still be 10 
percent instead of 80 percent, and 
insulin would not be available to 
help diabetics lead more normal, 
fuller Ii ves.

Gorbymania Fades as 
Soviet Reforms Falter 

By BEN BOYCHUK, Associate Opinion Editor 
When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced Tuesday that 

hehas decided to slow the pace of economic reforms in the Soviet Union, 
conservatives everywhere undoubtedly were saying, "We told you so." 
With recent social upheavals in various parts of the Soviet Union, most 
notably Lithuania, it comes as no surprise that Gorbachev is slowing 
down the pace of reforms. The world is finally beginning to see 
Gorbachev's true colors. 

The front page of the Tuesday, April 24 Los Angeles Times read, "The 
Kremlin heeds warning by conservatives. Radical changes postponed 
until next year. Social revolt feared." At last, people can see that 
Gorbachev's reforms are failing cat.astrophically. 

From the very beginning of Gorbachev 's rule, he was immensely 
popular in the Soviet Union and the world over. Gorbachev was a Soviet 
leader unlike any seen before: he was relatively young, charismatic, and 
seemed to offer new and radical ideas. Unlike Soviet leaders in the past, 
Gorbachev was willing to admit his nation's weaknesses, and seemed to 
be willing to offer drastic reforms in a country known for its rigidity and 
oppression. 

The world fell in love with Gorbachev. He was more popular in 
Europe and the United States than some of their own politicians. Time 
hailed him as the Man of the Year, then the Man of the Decade, a political 
Â·'visionary. " 

But the world was blind to the reality of Gorbachev. Richard Nixon 
explains the real motives ofGorbachev and his reforms in his 1988 book, 
1999: Victory Without War. Nixon writes, "Like other communist 
leaders, Gorbachev (is) determined, ruthless, and skilled at exploiting ... 
his own strengths . .. (and) his adversary's weaknesses." 

Nixon wrote as early as 1988 that Gorbachev's goal is "not to move 
the Soviet Union toward more freedom at home or a less aggressive 
policy abroad, but to make the communist system work better. He wants 
the system to be more efficient, not less communist." 

Certainly, any attempt by Gorbachev to make the Soviet Union less 
communist would mean his forced removal from office. Anyone who 
thinks otherwise is fooling himself. 

People are so blinded by the media hype and the public relations blitz 
that they don't think clearly. One does not assume the role of the most 
powerful man in the Soviet Union by touting radical reforms and 
heralding the end of the present system of goverment. Gorbachev is a

FEIFFERÂ® 

Positively Negative Campaigning 
N EW YORK - Ifthere's one thing we all "know," it 's that politics in America has gotten too negative, right? And if you want proof, consider what's going 00 in 

Florida, where one candidate for governor appears to be making the emotional stability of 
his chief rival a campaign issue. 

That's right. A few days ago, former U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles announced he was run-

Jeff Greenfield 
Universal Press Syndicate 

ning for governor. He also acknowledged 
that he had been taking the drug Prozac as 
part of treatment for depression. 

His rival, Rep. Bill Nelson, promptly 
released an of his medical records - Flor-

ida now knows that Nelson suffers the affliction of hemorrhoids - and challenged Chiles 
to do the same. 

Instead of the usual mumbo-jumbo about how "the people of Florida must decide 
whetherthey want a wacko in the governor's mansion," Nelson said flat-outthat the mental 
and emotional health of a governor was a legitimate campaign issue. 

Pretty outrageous, right? What's that? You're not outraged? Well, neither am 1. In fact, 
I think the really outrageous aspect of debate over "negative" politics is the automatic 

Pretty outrageous, right? What's that? You're not 
outraged? Well, neither am I. In fact, I think the really 
outrageous aspect of debate over "negative" politics 
Is the automatic response of "outrage" to perfectly 
legitimate questions about our would-be leaders. 

response of "outrage" to perfectly legitimate que~tion about our would-be leaders. 
Take the issue of Lawton Chiles' emotional health. It is absolutely true that millions, 

perhaps tens of millions of us have at one time or another gone through emotional crises 
in our lives and sought professional help. 

If that's the situation former Senator Chiles found himself in, it is perfectly explainable 
to the people of Florida-or at least it should be. But if the Florida electorate is unwilling 
to accept that explanation, does that justify ignoring the issue? 

Not in my view. Chiles is asking the people of Florida to give him a substantial power 
over their lives; they have a right to know about his present physical, mental or emotional 
health. 

But suppose Chiles' opponents try to slander him, to mislead the public, to somehow 
paint him as a basket case likely. to flip out in moments of crisis? 

That would be a perfect example of the difference between legitimate and illegitimate 
"negative" campaigns. It is the differe'nce between pointing to an opponent's record and 
lying about it. 

And there's reasonable evidence that voters understand the difference. In the recently 
concluded Texas gubernatorial primary, Ann Richards refused to answer questions about 
whether she had abused drugs during her years as an alcoholic. Her opponent in the run-
off, Attorney General Jim Mattox, tried to exploit that issue by running ads that asked 
ominously whether Richards had used marijuana or cocaine in her years as a local official. 

The problem was that Mattox had no proof. The public apparently recoiled from the 
charge, and he lost the run-off in a landslide. 

This has rmplications for Florida. If the Nelson campaign raises the issue honestly and 
dispassionately, then it will be up to Lawton Chiles to put that question to rest - for 
instance, by releasing his doctors from the physician-patient bond of confidentiality and 
allowing them to answer the press's questions. 

But if the campaign of Bill Nelson insists on going for the jugular, if it tries to raise false 
innuendos about Lawton Chiles, the voters may well cry "foul" and punish the Nelson 
campaign for its excesses. 

Doe all this sound like a repugnant. "negative" campaign? To me, it sounds like a 
perfectly legitimate debate over the fitne of a candidate to hold high office.

Fashionable Environmentalism 
Editor: 

As I walked through the Earth Day activities and displays at Revelle Plaza on 
Friday, I was left with a burning question: Is UCSD attempting to heighten awareness 
about environmental issues or simply trying to make a fashion statement? My 
concerns arose from the presence of vendors and others selling 1960s-inspired 
clothing and paraphernalia (tie-dyed t-shirts, incense, etc.). 

I realize that it is currently very hip among UCSD students to wear "earthy" 
clothing, but do these things have a primary place in a political and social cause? 
Friday's event implied that they do. For years, environmental issues have <been 
pigeonholed by the genera) population as belonging to a radical fringe of activists 
with lots of body hair. 

I believe that this has undermined the effectiveness of the environmental move-
menL In order to transcend the stereotypes associated with environmentalism and 
widen its base of support. fashion must be left out. It is very tempting for students to 
fall into a sort of Woodstock-inspired lovefest mentality concerning Earth Day, but 
I think that this weakens the intended credibility and effectiveness of the event, 
turning it into a costume pany. 

If environmental awareness is to be legitimized as the important national 
movement that it truly deserves to be, we rnust not confuse the real issues with a 
disposable fashion trend.

Don't Think Racism Doesn't Exist

thetic," April 23). Well, Mr. Partee, I assert 
to you that your idea of "realistic" is along 
the lines of a Walt Disney movie. 

In his letter regarding the incident at the 
Spike Lee lecture, Mr. Partee verbally at-
tacks an African-American woman for at-
tempting to use her race to get a photograph 
of Mr. Lee. Partee further asserts that the 
white "blonde haired, blue-eyed" woman 
must have been a photographer, thereby 
implying that she had every right to take 
pictures in the gym. 

As I walked into the gym that evening to 
see the lecture I was confronted with a 
notice that stated "No cameras or recording 
devices allowed." Nowhere on that notice 
did it say "except for press photographers." 
1 would also like to point out that from 
where I was sitting, I could see and hear 
cameras, all of them in the po ession of

more did she need? 

The incident that occurred mayor may 
not have been racial. But, Mr. Partee, I 
believe you are wmng when you write that 
"the old black woman" didn't get anything 
out of the lecture. It is you who missed the 
point that racism can take many forms, and 
just because the KKK. is not burning crosses 
on the Hump doesn't mean that racism is 
dead on this campus or anywhere. 

I do agree when you say that "getting 
what you want by using your race, or at the 
expense of another race is patheticl"That's 
exactly what has been going on in this 
country and on this campus. Get your head 
out of the hole Mr. Partee, and in tead of

estroika. The Soviet people, fac-
ing more hortage and higher 
prices, have been clamoring for 
speedier reforms. Meanwhile, the 
hard-line conservatives within the 
party have been demanding lower

The spirit of radical reform that 
has swept Ea tern Europe is 
sweeping the Soviet Union, and it 
has Gorbachev concerned. 

Lithuania ' declaration of inde-
pendence, violence in Armenia 
and Azerbaijan - all of these in-
ternal upheavals have put Gor-
bachev in a very bad po ition. At 
last, he is being forced to renege 
on reforms and tighten the screws 
on domestic conflicts. 

Tuesday's news is not surpris-
ing, considering the events of 
recent weeks. Gorbachev i finaJly

- a communist looking to main-
tain communism. 

Unfortunately, Gorbachev al-
lowed too much to go too far. 
Glasnost, the spirit of openness, is 
proving to be Gorbachev's bane. 

The Chinese Tiananmen Sq uare 
massacre showed the genie of re-
form can be put back in the bottle, 
at least for a while. But one thing 
is certain: allowing freedoms has 
provided the rope. The question 
now is whether or not Gorbachev 
will hang himself with his own 
policies.

Homework Regulations 
Editor: 

Day care as well as traffic problems could be alleviated if 
employees were encouraged to work at home. Many perform 
word processing, programming, reading, electronic mail and 
othertasks that do not require thei r presence at an office every day. 

Many have a personal computer dedicated to them. Ifrhey can 
arrange their schedule such that they could work at home with 
their computer one or more days per week, they hould be encour-
aged to do so. 

They will be happier and more productive employees as a 
result of having the freedom and responsibility to work where and 
when it is best for them and the business. They will save transit 
time and cost and preparation for work time (get your elf dressed 
for work, the kids dressed for the sitter, and pack everyone into the 
car). 

They can do a lot of work at night when the kids are asleep. 
They will spend les time at an office dealing with family prob-
lems by telephone. 

While government demands more taxes for roads, local gov-
e rnment zoning ordinances and Federal Acquisition Regulation 
obstruct the ability of people to work at home, which would 
greatly alleviate the need for highway expansion. 
. The zoning regulations are a good way for politicians to hurt 
their enemies and reward their friends by restricting busine s 
competition or changing the market value of land. Labor union 
bosses like both regulations. As the Libertarians advocate, regu-
lations are bad for commuters and parents as well as consumers 
and taxpayers.

Health Educators 
Use Humor to Put 
Condom Use Into 
Perspective 
'We use condoms and bananas to make 
it fun,' says educator Chris Oakley 
By GA VI CHRISTY 
Staff Writer 

The start of any relationship 
can be awkward. Communication 
may be a barrier rather than an 
aid. Add sex to the relationship 
and communication can be 
impossible. 

To increase communication 
within couples, Chris Oakley and 
Dolynn Proffitt, health educators 
for the Student Health Center, in-
corporate humor into their 
programs on sexual health 
education. 

Many students attend these 
programs to learn more about 
themselves and their mates, ac-
cording to the organizers. 

"The e programs have been 
valuable in establishing the 
communication within couples," 
Proffitt said. 

According to Proffitt, students 
often attend the programs on the 
premise of asking how to use a 
condom, when they really seek to 
learn how to better communicate 
with their mate. 

"You need a sense of humor, 
and these programs put things in 
perspective," Oakley com-
mented. 

The educators said the awk-
wardness of the subject matter 
during presentations is eased by 
the levity of the phallic bananas. 

"We use condoms and 
bananas to make it fun," Oakley 
said. "People remember more 
from humor, and education uses 
a lot of different methods." 

Photo by Bill Gerhardt 

Last year, health educators Chris Oakley and Dolynn Proffitt started a "Bring Your 
Own Banana" program to educate students about condom use. 

During Fall Quarter at Revelle 
College, they ho ted a program 

hoping for on a date and in other 
social situations, the educators 
said. in which about 40 dormitory 

residents were instructed to bring 
bananas. The ensuing "Bring 
Your Own Banana" (BYOB) 
evening taught these students 
about condoms and proper 
condom techniques - using 
fruit. 

Oakley said it is important for 
people (0 have an opportunity to 
talk about sex and find out the 
views of their peers. Through 
open-forum discussion groups 
that Proffitt and Oakley arrange, 
students are given the opportu-

nity to discuss different scenarios 
that occur during relationships 
and to analyze possible responses 
to such si tuations should they 
ever arise with each other, the 
educators said. 

By discussing relationships 
with others, students are given 
insight into what motivates the 
other sex and what they are 

"It all gets back to your level 
of communication," Proffiu sa id. 

She said that when one 
member of a couple is left sec-
ond guessing as to what the other

HUMOR: Students at Ease 
When Discussing Sexuality 
Continued from page 8 

A major problem in the sexual 
part of many relationships is the 
use of alcohol and drugs , the ed u-
cators said. These '"sexual lubri-
cants" act to decrease inhibitions, 
Oakley and Proffitt said. 

"Alcohol may make it easierfor 
a person to do something that one 
wouldn't do otherwise," Oakley 
sa id. 

By openly discu sing issues of 
sex and drugs and other aspects of 
relationships, students are able to 
ponder the question of " What if' in

ship without having to endure the 
reality of consequent results,

Exploration of st uden ts' 
thoughts and feelings in regard to 
sex ual matters is the goal of many

SlajJWriler

celebration, gallery exhibi ts, 
unusual foods, lectures, entertain-
ment, and information about 
UCSD's colleges and programs. 

According to Open House 
Chairman Yolanda Garcia, the 
event is UCSD's way of giving 
something back to the community. 
In addition, becau e "mo t of the 
entertainment and all of the lec-
tures are done by UCSD students 
and faculty, Open House is an 
opportunity to showcase what 

UCSD has," she said. 
AlthQugh Garcia does not see 

Open House as a recruitment de-
vice, she doe view it as an event to 
which "intere ted pan ies can come 
and learn about UCSD." 

"One of the beauties of Open 
House is that the staff, faculty, and 
tudents really get actively in-

volved in it," Garcia aid. T hrough-
out the day, "UCSD staff and stu-
dents will be on hand to di cuss the 
five-college system, academic 

programs and assistance, financial 
aid, campus life, housing, and the 
admission process to UCSD and 
its graduate school ." 

But as ide from the tours and in-
fo nnation booths that will be avail-
able, "each one of the colleges 
does the ir own progranl , which in 
orne way reflects the philosophie 

of the diffe rent colleges," Garcia 
said. 

During Open House, Revelle 
College w ill present its annual

litica l Science Building 4 12. near

ment, and increased security. 

"Until we sat down and looked 
over the logistics of having the Sun 
God Festival, we didn't know we 
had to have [many essential items] 
like porta-potties and a UC ve-
hicle," McKay said. 

When McKay was questioned 
as to why she didn't use the $2,000 
that was left overafterthe festival 's 
fireworks were cancelled, she 
explained that the $2,000 had al-
ready been redistributed to pay for 
other expenses. 

Randy Woodard, director of 
student government, added that 
"the Price Center increased Ibe 
amount of security we needed to 
have ... and other changes in ex-
penses added up. That's where the 
$2,000 was redistributed to." 

A.S. President John Ramirez 
felt that while the A.S. should al-
low the $749 for the festival, he 
was uneasy about the idea of pass-
ing a line-item budget with a redis-
tributed $2,000 when he didn't 
know where the $2,000 went. 

The A.S. Council also approved 
the a\1ocation of $300 from New 
Media Unallocated for (39 Type-
set, a new media magazine. Much 
of the objection to the a\1ocation 
was over whether there is a de-
mand for another literary maga-
zine on campus and whether or not 
people would read (39 Typeset. 

"Will this be read or wi\1 it sit 
around and waste trees? .. . The 
Bird Cage [a literary magazine], T 
remember, sat around, so [ won-
der, is there a demand for this type 
of media on campus?" asked Vice 
Presidenl of Finance Anders 
Roede. 

"Not unless we invest the $300 
wi1\ we find out how this magazine 
works . . . we need to upport

sioner of Public Relations Benny 
Singer said. "Give it a trial vote, 
and if it doesn' t work, then we ' ll

I PCVC TOURNAMENT 
Men's Volleyball Puts 
Two-year PCVC Win 
Streak On the Line 

UCSD Heads to Santa Clara for a First Round 
Matchup With UCSC in Conference Tourney 

By PETER KO 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball team has 
never lost a game in the history of the Pacific 
Coast Volleyball Conference. 

Pretty impressive, huh? 
Not really. Why? Well, in the first place, 

the league - as it is named now - has only 
been in existence for two years. 

Second of all, what 's acoupleofMenlos 
or La Vemes when you spend the beller part 
of your season playing the likes of Long 
Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, and San 
Diego State? 

But, the fact of the matter is, in confer-
ence play, UCSD compete with Menlo and 
La Verne in addition to Santa Clara and UC 
Santa Cruz. 

So, it is with this resignation in mind that 
the Tritons head to Santa Clara University 
tomorrow for the conference tournament 
and a 5 p.m. first round matchup with UC 

Santa Cruz. 
"Wc are confident, having gone 8-0 this 

season - not overly confident, but we're 
confident," UCSD Head Coach Oscar 
"Digger" Graybill said. 

Despite its two-year winning streak and 
Santa Cruz 's 3-5 conference record, the 
Tritons could get burned if they are not 
careful. 

In UCSC, the Tritons will face a double-
barreled attack led by 6' I" outside hitter 
Ken Mitchell and his partner in crime, 6'2" 
outside hitter les Bolger. 

"They're not tall , but they are cagey and 
smart players," Graybill aid. 

Mitchell , an AIl-PCVC player last year, 
recorded a .300 hitting percentage and tal-
lied 82 kills on the year. Bolger equaled 
Mitchell' s 82 kills , and bettered his partner 
with a team-high .325 hitting percentage. 

As for UCSD, it will be led (as it has all 
year) by senior middle-hitter John Lim, so-

UCSD: You're Not Welcome in Div. III Anymore 

If a piranha is let loose in a sea of goldfish it will 
thrive because of a lack of fiercer competition. 

A human athlete, however, will not react the same 
way. 

Athletes seek out tougher competition, always wanting 
to challenge themselves. When competition is lacking, 
the athletes head elsewhere. 

The UCSD SportS teams are in this type of a situation. 
Far superior to the majority of Division III competi-

tion. many Triton team frequently schedule competition 
from Division I , II, and NAIA. 

In fact, everyone eems to know what they want: The 
athletes want to play the better schools, the student body 

DAVID POTICHA 
would like to ~ee UCSD entertain some big names, and 
the adminbtration wants to build more hospitals. 

But nobody has stopped to a~k: what do the other Di-
viSIOn III schools want? 

Quite simply, West Coast Division III schools would 
rather see UCSD stomping around in Division II. 

Dave Beyer, Sports Information Director (SID) from 
Cal State San Bernardino feels UCSD has "proven to 
have quality athletics at this level by now." 

Francis Hill , the sm at Occidental, feels that, "UCSD 
could be competitive on a national level at Division U." 

A move to Divi"ion II would mean a few changes for 
UCSD, but not a many a some people think. 

Sure, Divi\inn II carries with it the dreaded "athletic 
scholarship." UCSD. however, would not be fo rced to 
grant them. 

As for possible exceptions in admissions , the current 
adml sion standard could be maintained. 

It b apparent that the present group of Triton athletes 
are already competitive with Divbion U, and even 
Division I ~chool~ , and they are here under the same 
academic conditions as everyone else. 

But, the Triton teams arc too good for most of 
DJ vblon Ill. A rece lll informal ~urvey listed UCSD and 
Trenton State in New Jersey as the mo t successful 
Divl\lon HI programs of the 1980s. 

In addition, CSUSB is 
one of the main UCSD 
"rivals", and it is going to 
j ump to Division II next 
year. 

The women's tennis 
team routinely chedules 
Division I and II opponents. 

Men 's water polo plays 
and consistenly beats 
Division I chools in the 
Open Division. 

Men 's volleyball played 
its first 15 games against 
top-ranked DiVision 1 and II 
opponents. 

Beyer stated that being 
Division III makes "scheduling ridiculous, doesn't give 
the teams any stability, and doe n't allow the develop-
ment of true rivals." 

Beyer said that UCSD has "an established tradition in 
athletic excellence," and has " pretty much shown they 
can take care of themselves." 

Beyer encourages a move to Division II by UCSD 
because he agrees that athletes need to be challenged, and 
UCSD athletes are not really challenged by Division III 
fodder. 

For example, on ly one Triton team has failed to 
achieve a top 20 ranking at some point thi s year. 

UCSD is an intimidating Division III presence, and 
could soon have problems finding Division III opponellls. 

Pomona College SID Netti Morrison said, "There is 
no reason why UCSD shouldn 't go Division n. 

"Division III coaches think twice before cheduling 
UCSD:' she said. Morrison explained that coaches know 
a win against UCSD is not likely - but a loss is. 

"The general consen us is that UCSD is a large school 
student body-wise and, simply by randomness, U SD 
should statistically have more good athletes," she said. 

Redlands UOIversity SID Ross Baerer concur, aying 
that U SD has, at thi:> very moment, a "number of 
athletes worthy of playing DIvision 11:' 

Guardian Graphic by Jeff Quan 

Haefer points out that UCSD has an unfair size advan-
tage over most Division III schools,. and certai nly the 
schools in Redlands' division. 

" By pure population numbers there aren't many 
Division III schools of UCSD's size, certainly not in our 
league [SCIAC] ," he said. 

Hill notes that UCSD is "v iewed by orne, because of its

Baseball, Saturday, Noon 
WHERE: Softball at North Campus 

Baseball at New Field on Old Miramar Rd. 
WHO: Both vs. CSU San Bernardino 
WHY: Softball - the Triton have split four games 
this season with rival CSUSB, which UCSD is 
competing with for a West Regional playoff berth. 
Baseball - in important Division nr aClion, the 
Tritons' postseason hopes may rest on the ou tcome of 
these games.

Softball, Ranked 4th Regionally, Dumps Claremont for Twlnbill Sweep 
In this case, UCSD softball Head Coach Sal Coats might want to keep pouring fuel on the fire. 
The blazing Triton bats beat up on Claremont to the tune of 25 total hits and 19 runs in a 12-1,7-2 

roasting of the hosts on Tuesday, in preparation for the tomorrow's crucial doubleheader with CSU San 
Bernardino. 

Against Claremont, Cindi Murphy went three for fi ve with two RBIs in theopenerto pace the Tritons. 
She got help from Dianna Moreno, who went three for four with two RBIs. Kathy Fogg (7-7) went the 
distance to even her record at .500. 

In the second game, catcher Tracey Kehr hit her second home run of the year, a two-run dinger in the 
third inning, and Kim Stutzman picked up her ninth win of the season against just one loss. 

On Friday, UCSD will face regionally seventh-rankedCSUSBforthefifth and sixth times this season. 
The slumping Coyotes have never beaten UCSD on the Tritons ' new field and are currently struggling 
through a six-game lOSing streak. The doubleheader with CSUSB will more than likely clinch a berth 
in the West Regional playoffs for one of the two teams. 

Track and Field Sets Four School Records;. Three Just Miss Qualifying 
On Friday, the Tritons traveled to the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational and set three school records, while 

a fourth fell at the Mt. SAC Relays the next day. 
At the Invite. Yvette Marzullo streaked to a 59.15 in the 400 meters, and ran the second leg of the 

4x400 relay , along with lenifer Jagielski, Michelle Longyear, and Vicki Dunckley, in 4:04.51. 
Shannon Quigley hlJrled a 161'9" in the discus, long enough for a provisional qualifying mark in 

Divis ion 1. Defending double national champion Quigley is currently top-ranked in Division lU in the 
discus and second-ranked in the shot, followed by teammates Shelly Squibb and Rachel Beerman, who 

See S.LlNE, page 19

size and transfer rules and being a 
public school , as having an unfair 
advantage. " 

Hill also feels, like most of the 
other SIDs, that it would be to both 
UCSD's and Divi ion nT 's advan-
tage if UCSD were to make the 
j ump to Division II. 

Other than because Division ill 
schools want to get rid of UCSD, 
what would make adivision change 
a good idea? 

One important answer is the 
development of stable rivalries 
against the teams of similar talent 

levels. 
UCSD currently doesn ' t ha"e a 

true rival. 
CSUSB considers itself a Tri-

ton rival, but only in a few ports. 
UCSD has never lost to CSUSB in 
women's volleyball. 

There are not "big games" for 
the student body to look forward 
to. The truth is, UCSD never has 
big games. 

"It is certainly to the school's 
advantage to develop longterrn 
rivalries," Hill said. 

Haefer agrees, say ing being 
Division II and having good spons 
" increases the prestige of the 
school." 

Sounds like a good idea. 

There are certainly reasons to 
stay Division ill, buttherearebetter 
reasons to go Division II. 

I didn ' t even begi n to discuss 
what the Triton athletes or UCSD 
student body would prefer. 

Unfortunately, the administra-
tion has not hown much enthusi-
asm for increasing funding ofTri-
ton intercollegiate athletics. 

UCSD has one of the smallest 
spons budgets in the entire coun-
try , regardless of size or division, 
and a division jump would require 
more money for athletics. 

Regardless of what this school 
wants, however, it is clear that the 
other schools would like to say 
" Yer outla here!"

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... This is a bit risky, for upsets don ' t occur frequently in the first 
round of the NBA playoffs. But here goes ... take Phoenix, Dallas, and New York. Utah 
is overrated and fairly one-dimensional (Malone), Portland will choke, and Boston 
won ' t pull it off. As for the other guys, go with San Antonio, Detroit, Philly, and Jordan.

With weather cond itions chang-

been Kansas), tournament par-
ticipants found their games doing 
pretty much the same thing. In

through .... no one really could get 

The OTL Women's Division 
provided perhaps the most drama 
of the day as two evenly matched 
squads, Ruthless Babes and OTL/ 
OTR, battled it out for a good two 
and a half hours in a best 2-of-3 
showdown for the title. After 
splitting preliminary games, Ruth-
less and OTL/om squared off in 
a marathon final that rroduced a 
winner after 13 bruta innings of 
play (OTL is a five-inning game). 
In the end, the heroine wasOTL/ 

om's Amy Goldberg, a hard-hit-
tingjunior from MuirCollege, who 
carved a wicked, left-handed line 
drive into the court for the win-
ning RBI to give OTL/OTR a 6-5 
lead. Two more hits by teammates 
Jana Carey and Meg Wenrich 
boosted the final margin to 8-5 in 
the longest Over-TIle-Line game 
ever played in the 14-year old 
history of the tournament.

Perrier, sushi, thirtysomething, guys 
with ponytails, faux accents, car-
phones, sun-dried tomatoes, cappuc-
cinos, networking, pine nuts - Cafe 
Japengo, 

After dining in one of the four res-
taurants in La Jolla's Aventine com-
plex, Cafe Japengo, the aforemen-
tioned word association is easily un-
derstood. Entering the restaurant is 
something like being hit on the head 
with a 20 lb. slab of pretension. 

It's difficult to determine which ele-
ment of the restaurant Is the most snooty 
- is it the staff, who look like they just 
stepped out of an MlV video, or is it the 
decor, something of the currently 
trendy east-meets-west theme? 

It's safe to say that every female em-
ployee at Japengo looks like a Robert 
Palmer girl, and every male employee 
looks like a female employee, The serv-
ice, while efficient and friendly, has a 
strange element, You get the feeling 
that even though they are serving you 
now, if you had gone to high school 
with them, they wouldn't have sat next 
to you in the cafeteria. 

We could describe the atmosphere 
for you, but perhaps it would be better 
to let Executive Chef James Cleffi dis-

CUSS the symbolism and deep meaning 
behind the decor: "East meets West is the 
theme in food as well as interior, We 
worked on the opposites, the yin and the 
yang philosophy. Rocks on the ground, 
juxtaposed with slate and cement and 
silk-screens and metal. H Cleffi described. 

He explained in an interview that Jap-
engo means "a sharing of souls," He 
claims, â€¢ Food is just a small, small part of 
what Cafe Japengo is all about. H 

"Experience it - live Japengo," he 
continued, .. Japengo to me is a style of 
life. I would like anybody - Mr. Generic -
to come in here and feel comfortable. I 
wanted to create an atmosphere where 
people felt comfortable both networking 
and hanging out. I wanted this to be like 
a club and a restaurant. H 

The food maintains the trendy 
Darryl YeeiGuardian 

"I wanted familiar items so that I wouldn't scare 
people off," quality of the environment; 

however, for some un-
known reason, the food 
succeeds where the 
atmosphere fails . 

CAFE JAPENOO: 
8960 University Center 

Lane. 

Cleffi continued, "I wanted identifiable 
products so I could educate people, Jap-

engo is an unusual place; this type of 
food can 't be found everywhere: 

Clefti discussed the 
goal of the cuisine: 
"The food Is eclectic 
yet identifiable, with 
Asian influences, Uke, 
I have my (Western)

it with a sesame crust to 
give it that Asian overtone. 

Lunch hours 
11 :30 a.m. to 2:30 p,m., 

lion. - Fri. 

For starters, the grilled sake shrimp 
and cri$p vegetables ($9.50) is a wise 
choice. All the ingredients tasted fresh 

and were delicately seasoned. An-
other good appetizer is the warm duck 

and spinach salad with cabernet vinai-
grette ($6,50), The duck was tender and 

julcy, but not fatty - a rare combination. 
For the main dish, the menu is divided into 

three sections: The Wok, Woodroasted, and Pacific 
Rim Grill and Specialties, From the wok section, a rec-
ommended dish is Thai pork, Japanese eggplant with 
basil and crisp potatoes ($14,00), While spicy, the pork 
doesn't bring sweat to the brow,

5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. 

Sun. - Thurs., a 
5:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. 

Fri. and Sat. 

Another tasty choice for an entree, from the Pacific 
Rim Grill and Specialties portion, is the grilled Hawaiian 
mahi mahl and eggplant ($15,50) , All of the fish is fresh , 
and cooked to perfection, 

It is impossible to find fault with the food. The only 
complaint that could possibly be lodged is the price, 
but the menu is diverse enough to allow for an elegant 
dinner for under $20 per person, 

The wave of the future? Japengo's pretty, albeit pretentious, interior. Darryl YeeiGuardioll 

If you want to impress someone who reads Interview 
magazine or who thinks Brett Easton Ellis is a really 
bitchin' writer, then take that someone to Cafe Jap-
engo. Otherwise, it should be avoided at all costs. 
After all , what kind of restaurant has billboards with a 
picture of a woman with multi-colored teased tresses 
for advertising?

Beer Checkers: Boot Factor 2 

Beer Checkers is not intended for old men on 
park benches. Rather, mixing beer and checkers 
makes the most boring game on earth really 
come to life. 

To play, merely substitute shot glasses filled 
with beer for checkers. When your cup is jumped, 
you drink it. And when your men make it across 
the board, instead of"kinging" them and making 
them double shots, you can replace the beer with 
a shot of hard booze. 

Opposing players should use different colors or 
styles of shot glasses. Or, bener yet, use light and 
dark beer.

Bunji jumping is a sacred African ritual of 
manhood, entailing a feat only the most daring 
and brave f the young tribesmen would at-
tempt. The aspiring boys must scale a huge plat-
form, bind their feet with heavy vine and then, 
in a leap of faith, perilously jump from their 
perch. Dangling only inches above the earth, 
these young men tretch the limits of skill and 
reach out for their own identity. 

a year and a half. Members include de Gaillande, 
Jon Holt on vocals and bass, Eric Linberg on sax, 
and Jeremy Chri tensen on drums. The band has 
played the Spirit club, the Triton Pub, and numer-
ous UCSD parries. Their set is composed of origi-
nal material with a few covers of classic rockers 
added in as party favorites . 

Bunji Thump is currently recording their first 
tape Soul in Your Skin. It will contain about 13 
originals and be available at Assorted Vinyl. Off 
the Record, and at gigs. De Gaillande describes it 

The local band Bunji 
Thump adopts a similar con-
cept. They test the bounda-

as having "a bigger sound 
than when we play live." Bunji Thump 

The group attempts to get 
serious about describing song topics . "We handle 
the '90s tunnoil generation: lots of love, hate, 
confusion, tension," de Gaillande explained. The 
most successful step in their work comes when the 
rest ofthe band gets a hold of the tunes. "Our input 
can make [a difference)," Christensen said. "We 
can make it completely different than what John 
or Pierre intended." 

ries of all known and accepted genres of music. 
They are a band protesting throw-away, imita-
tion groups. 

The ground-breaking sound of Bunj i Thump 
is rooted in their original concept ,and their very 
diversified influences. Sometimes compared to 
bands such as R.E.M., the Red Hot Chili Pep-
pers, and Fishbone, Bunji Thump is not easily 
characterized . "We like the fact that we're differ-
ent," lead singer/guitari t Pierre de Gaillande 
sa id in a recent interview. 

The quartet's influences range from The Min-
utemen and Aero mith. to Miles Davis and 
alternative music . When these styles mix, the 
result is funky, experimental, and uncontrolla-
b ly danceable. 

Bunji Thump can be heard competing in the 
Battle of the Bands on campus. Christensen feels 
they have a good chance of winning, "but we're lip 
against some pretty good bands ... We want to 
have a good time, butalsoplayollf best. Our music 
is meant to be danced to. It's great seeing people 
out there having a good time." 

Each song has its own unique identity, held 
together by cool sax lines and hard rocking 
drums. Some crowd pleasers are their rollicking 
"Bunji Thump," and their potently funky rendi-
tion of Prince's "Kiss." The band also shifts gears 
for some slower numbers withajazzy, reggae feel, 
such as "You Made My Life."

Oingo Boingo 
Dark at the End of the Tunnel 
MeA Records 

Every time Oingo Boingo re-
leases a new album, a lot of people 
say that they've changed their style. 
When Darkac the End of the Tunnel 
is compared to their early work, 
there is a uefinite difference in 
mood and style. 

Danny Elfman, the group's lead 
inger and songwriter, is a true 

musical genius who does not settle 
for rehashing old work. He i the 
type of artist who is constantly 
looking for new frontiers to cross 
and new sounds to create. 

Although it went rather unno-
ticed this year, Elfman composed 
the original classical score for the 
Warner Bros. hit "Batman." In ad-
dition, he has recently been drafted 
to do the theme music to the 
Simpson's and the score for "Dick 
Tracy." 

Elfman's knack for writing po-
tent and meaningful lyrics has 

made him a popular figure in the 
entertainment industry. Many of 
his lyrics are thought provoking 
and often strangely metaphysical. 
In what is possibly one of Boingo's 
best songs ever, "Out of Control," 
the issue of suicide is pondered. In 
true Elfman style, a sense ofhopc IS 
offered through the inspiring lyr-
ics. 

Throughout the album there IS 
a wonderful meshing of detailed, 
meaningful lyrics and original, 
diverse music. One may not ice that 
thesong"T ty to Believe," although 
very good, does not sound like 
something the group would nor-
mally produce. It is the only song 
not written by Elfman. 

Elfman and the rest of Boingo . 
have a style a ll their own, which 
can not be said of many groups in 
the mainstream of popular music 
today. One would think that this 
would make them a success on a 
world-wide sca le. 

Yet, Oingo Boingo chooses to 
maintain a low profile by not at-
tracting press nor pumping out 
continual concert tours. Because 
of this, they have remained rela-
tively unknown outside of their 
homeland Southern California. 

Perhaps it is the fact that they 
do not seek the rock-'n'-roll star 
lifestyle that has accounted for 
thelr consistent releases of quality 
music over the last decade. 

- Scott Casmer 

Various Artists 
Blues at Newport 
Vanguard Records 

If you're looking for a sample of 
some really great blues music, then 
Blues at Newport is a good invest-
menl for your record collection. 
The album features 11 blues greats 
performing a total of 19 songs. 

MississippiJohn Hurt opens the 
album with the light-hearted 
"Candy Man" and "Coffee Blues." 
Hurt's bluegrass guitar style blends 
nicely with the comical stories 
about candy and coffee. Keeping 
with the tradition of blues music, 
many songs tell somber tales of 
broken hearts and los ing loved 
ones. 

Reverends Gary Davis and 
Robert Wilkins contribute a set of 
religiOUS c uts to the blues collec-
tion. Wilkins' "(I Wish I Was In) 
Heaven Sitting Down" is a classic, 
with its slow rhythmic guitar and 
the deep, chilling vocals. 

Skip James tells his tale of los-
ing his wife in "Devil Got My 
Woman" with the guitar and har-
monica grooving in the back-
ground. 

Although the album is enjoy-

ab le on the whole, John Lee 
Hooker gave the mo t outstandmg 
performance out of the 11 featured 
performers. His song "Sometimes 
You Make Me Feel So Bad" sends 
chills down the spine. 

His guitar-playing is so power-
ful that it is hard to believe there 
was only o ne guitar playing 
throughout the song, and his deep, 
raspy voice has a hypnotic effect. 

The people at Vanguard Rec-
ordsdid a wonderful job incompil-
ing this collection. The work is 
never boring because there is 
something fresh and unique about 
each artist. 

Blues at Newporc caters to both 
the diehard blues fan and the dis-
crimating recordshopper. If you've 
never bought a blues album in 
your life but you're interested in 
experiencing the beauty of lush 
music, this album will not disap-
point. 

Lock Up 

-Tony Lo 

LID 
IP 

Something Bitchin' This W /l)' Come! 
Geffen Records 

Kind of monotonous, but itstill 
rocks. This describes almost every 

cutoffSomeching Birchin' This Way 
Comes, the late t offering by the 
L.A.-based band Lock Up. 

With 12 cuts to show their 
metal, so to speak, the group fails 
to make a mark for themselves. 
Influences by such o ther heavy-
weights as Van Halen, Led Zeppe-
lin, and even the Godfathers, are 
evident throughout the album. 
These influences are most obvious 
in "24 Hour Man," a song which 
begins with a very Zeppelin-esque 
intra, utilizing bass, drums, and 
guitars to set the song's tone. 
Midway through the cut, however, 
the lyrics degenerate to chanting 
"work" every four beats, similar to 
the Godfathers' "Birth, School, 
Work, Death." 

Fo rtunately for the listener, 
there are a few songs on the album 
which do stand out. The first ex-
ample is "Everywhere I Go I t Looks 
Like Rain," written by lead singer 
Brian Grillo. An expected song on 
such a hard rocking album , its 
slower rhythm and heavy back-
beat are a possible indication that 
Lock Up might be able to create 
their own sound rather than "bor-
rowmg" one from another proven 
winner. 

The o nly other song worth 
mentioning is "Ki s It Goodbye," 
which, not unlike the other songs 
on the album, reiterates the idea 
that rock-and-ro ll is supposed to 
be heavy and rebellious: "Eight-
een is o ld enough to go to war / 
Sign up now / You wonder what 
you are here for /Said here is where 
you find yourself / When you ask

and needle sly graphic film ab ut a criminal fresh out of the "joint." Not 
only i the movie gratuitou Iy violent, but it al 0 lacks uspense, drama, 
and a plot. In addition to the e major flaws, the character are too pre-
dictable for th film to be even remotely entertaining. 

Junior Fregner, played by Alec Baldwin i the main character. Junior 
i neither likeable nor credible. Within the first even minutes of the 
film, he manages to steal a suitca e from an innocent child and kill a 
Hare Kri hna. 

Baldwin's acting I great, but that d es nothing to make hi charac-
ter any more appealing. He is slime. His goal in life is to "get rich quick" 
at any co t. He kills, he teals, he lie without limit. To make matters 
wor , he enjoy doing what he do . George Armit, creenwriter/ 
direct r, fails to make thi p ychopathic criminal likeable. Not only i 
Junior contemptible, he is unbelievable. 

The film opens with Junior's arrival in Miami, where he hooks up 
with local pro titute u ie Waggoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) . Susie i the 
antithesi of Junior' character. She has a big heart and all she wants i 
a Burger World franchi e. Even though her character i more endearing 
than Junior' ,she is unbearably two-dimen ional in her ign rance and 
naÂ·lvete. 

Waggoner falls in love with Junior and everything eems perfect-
except Junior doe not want to leave hi lucrative life of crime. That's 
where Detective Hoke Mo eley come in.

tive on the verge of retirement. 
Unlike all the other characters who are completely en ationalistic or 
totally trite, Ward's portrayal of Mo eley is almo t realistic. Ward's 
acting is well refined and di ciplined to the role. 

The movie tarted out slow and failed to pick up in its hour and a half 
duration. There was no logical sequence in the story and the only thing 
the viewer feel is apathy. If you really want to ee "Miami Blues" despite 
these warning, then save yourself some money and walt until it come

Fleetwood Mac 
Behind the Mask 
Warner Bros. 

Fleetwood Mac isn't really a 
band that should release their 
albums in the spring; they're more 
of an autumn band by nature, with 
an air of exotic mystique pervad-
ing throughout thei songs. Au-
tumn is a muted brown time of 
vagueness and loss; feelings seem 
to be lurking just beneath the sur-
face, about to go into hibernation 
until spring's bright green arrival. 

Fleetwood Mac has spent quite 
a bit of time in hibernati n in th 
past decade, particularly since 
Lind y Buckingham' 1987 de-
parture. And, from the sound of 
thclr latest offering, the hand till 
need to thaw out a bit. 

The aptly-titled Behind the Mask 
- the first album of new material 
they've produced without 
Buckingham's strong artistic in-
put - suffers mainly from the 
expected lack of consistency in 
styles resulting from the personnel 
change. Also disappointing is the 
use of cliches in the songs ranging 
from "It's better to have loved and \ 
lost / Then [sic] to never have 
loved at all" to "Love, love, love / 
Love is dangerous." 

The new lineup does show 
promise. Of particular note is new 
guitarist Billy Burnette's "In the 
Back of My Mind,"on which Stevie 
Nicks sings "backup" as a con-
cience-like reply to Burnette's 

obsessive rantings. The song, 
which features an avant-garde, 
ominou -sounding intro with dis-
tant drums and Laurie Anderson-
esque distorted spoken words, IS 
destined to become a Fleetwood 
Mac classic. 

While the band lost some of its 
more innovative and powerful 
songwriting with Buckingham'S 
departure, Nicks and Christine 
McVie succeed in carrying a great 
deal of weight on Behind the Mask. 
The title song, written and sung by 
McVie, continues to haunt the 
listener long after it's over, with its 
wavering, searching, and contrast-
ing themes - both musical and 
lyrical. 

Nicks brings songs full of im-
agery and feeling to the album, 
including one, "The Second 
Time," that touchingly seems to 
peak of the final breakup between 

former lovers Buckingham and 
Nicks, which she says took place 
shortly before he left the band.

Galway's Audience Disappointed J't 
Zukerntan Plays Magically 

By JEAN SUZUKI 
Contributing Writer J'.I' 

Something unexpected happened at the San 
Diego Civic Theatre on April 21. The La Jolla 
Chamber Mu ic ciety's pre entation of James 
Galway and the Tokyo Stl ing Quartet transformed 
into Eugenia Zukerman and the Tokyo String 
Quartet.The obvious disappointment of the audi-
ence wa reflected by the mediocre turnout and the 
departure of more people during intenn i ion. What 
happened to Jame Galway? 

According to a representative of the music 
ociety, Galway is now ho pitalized in Philadel-

phia for an inflamed intestine and had to cancel his 
engagements this week. While his hospitalization 
wa unfortunate, his replacement, Eugenia Zuker-
man, was outstanding. 

The first two pieces, Mozart' Flute Quartets in 
o Major and in A Major showcased Zukerman's 
lighthearted performance on the flute . Perfonning 
before a painted background scene from Mozart's 
"The Magic Flute," Zukerman paralleled the light-
hearted mood that the background created with 
her mu ic. The quartet's music perfectly comple-
mented the flute without overwhelming it. The 
two pieces involving Zukennan's flute were the 
most enjoyable of the evening. 

The other two pieces were string quartets, in-
cluding one in F Major by Beethoven. Though the 
quartet performed exquisitely, the music became 
monotonous after a while. After the bright flute 
performances, the string pieces seemed melan-
choly, acting like a lead weight compared to the 

flute. 
Zukerman, while an extra rdinary flutist, 

is also a writer and television commentator 
for CBS unday Morningwith Charles Kuralt. 
On stage, he projected the image of an untra-
ditional chamber musician. With a flowing 
red jacket hanging to her ankles, she con-
trasted sharply with the straightlaced quartet, 
reflecting her personal individualism as well 
as her musical strength. 

The Tokyo String Quartet, formed in 1969, 
projected confidence throughout the eve-
ning. The 20 years of experience showed 
clearly in their performance, with the mu i-
cians interacting perfectly and complement-
ing each other. 

The group rna terfully allowed the flute to 
dominate, while modulating their own music 
to a background sound that perfectly accom-
panied the soft flute. 

It was unfortunate that the dominant mood 
of the evening was one of disappointment 
that Galway was unable to perform. The 
audience only came alive as the mu icians 
turned their music pages, when a wave of 
coughs and niffles penneated the theater. 
Coughs popped up one after the other as soon 
as there was a break in the music, and then si-
lence would take over as soon as the music 
was about to begin again. 

This performance was one in the Celeb-
rity Series presented by the La Jolla Chamber 
Music Society. Bravo to the Tokyo String 
Quartet for an excellent performance, and 
particularly to Eugenia Zukerman for follow-
ing Galway' advice to "have fun with the 
boys." 

wood Mac tree. Although the band 
still needs to warm up to its new 
lineup, spring may be just around 
the corner. Fleetwood Mac's thaw-
ing temperature is equivalent to 
just about any other band's boiling 
point.

emotional extension than a physi-

follows suit. "Black Monk Theme,

stressing "Do you know I hate you, 
baby / You maladjusted little 
monkey, you."

The Church 
Gold Afternoon Fix 
Arista Records 

Capitalizing on their recent first 
Top 40 hit, "Under the Milky 
Way," the Church continue to 
shoot for the stars with their new 
album, Gold Afternoon Fix. 

The title should have read Gold 
Afternoon Fixation. This album is 
truly an accomplished work to-
wards the band's surrealistic style 
oflyricscombined with indulgently 
emotional guitar. Amazingly uni-
fied and directed, the work comes 
as a surprise since the trio have 
nine solo albums behind them. 

Steve Kilby, bassist and lead 
vocalist/lyricist, explained, "Now 
it is more like everyone's got their 
own stuff done, everyone want to 
interact more." 

And interact they do. Fr m the 
opening notes in the "The Pha-
roah" to the final chord f"Grind," 
the band plays as an IOten ely 
emotional and uOified group. 

The songs on the album cover a 
vast array of topics. From the 
struggles of the civilized jungle 
("Metropolis") to the conflicts of 
the human heart ("You're Still 
Beautiful"), the Australian quar-
tet strikes chords in listener's heart 
time and time again. 

When listening to the album, 
take Kilby's advice: "Gold After-
noon Fix? To me, now, the phrase 
means a record to play on a nice 
afternoon."

The Fall 
Extricate 
Polygram Records 

After 12 years and 16 albums, 
the Fall is still able to deliver a 
fresh, innovative product. The 
band follows in tradition, creating 
an album of compeillng and ex-
tremely catchy melodies, aug-
mented by the har h, facetiously 
flat vocals of Mark E. mith. 
Extricate, the Man hester band's 
first Polygram release, i a wel-
come addition to their impr !>sive 
repert ire. 

Though very c reativ , the 
band's albums inc rporate om-

Another stock theme is a mock-
silliness, which is quite adequately 
conveyed in the pointed "Hilary": 
the song gratefully expresses "I 
thank the lord you still don't live 
next to me / Hilary / Hey Hilary / 
Oh Hilary." 

"Bill is Dead" is an ironic song, 
riddled with sarcasm as Smith, 
chants "These are the greate t 
times of my life." This, coming 
from a man who had just gone 
through divorce, the death of his 
father, and a near fatal road acci-
dent. 

The musical backbones of the 
songs run the gamut from a funky 
wah-wah-influenced guitar to 
peaceful, dreamy organ. "Black 
Monk Theme, Part I," the album's 
strongest track, employs a simplis-
tic and repetitive driving beat, 
punctuated by a complem ntary 
guitar snag, with bits of intermit-
tent wavering organ. The steady 
stream of mu ic in the ng i sup-
plemented by Smith's blunt, in-
cessant, stuttering drawl, which 
challenges you not to be irritated. 
Appreciation for the Fall is an 
acquired taste, indeed. 

The album's lyrics are inane, 
the vocals ju t shy of annoying, 
and the music itself is, at most, 
repetitive. But the e elements are 
o stra tegi ally twisted and ex-

ploited that they produce a won-
derfully diverse, engaging, and 
extremely addictive coli ction of 
songs. Extricate is th FalPs best 
effort in five ycars.
