Norris said that the study, funded by the 
German Research Foundation and the U.S. 
National Science Foundation, exposed the “trou-

ing the Cretaceous climate. Additionally, although 
modern climate models indicate with some accu-

they may stop being effective if global warming

New research from Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography indicates glacial ice may have exist-
ed 91 million years ago during a period known as 
the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, when high 
ocean temperatures created a “supergreenhouse” 
effect similar to today’s global warming.

The study, conducted by SIO researchers André 
Bornemann, Oliver Friedrich and Richard Norris, 
counters commonly held assumptions that the ice 
caps at Earth’s poles have always melted during past 
periods of intense global warming.

Instead, it suggests that glaciers about half the 
size of the modern Antarctic ice cap were pres-
ent for about 200,000 years during the thermal 
maximum, a period in which tropical ocean tem-
peratures were higher than today’s temperatures by 
about 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Working as a postdoctoral scholar on the proj-
ect in 2005, Bornemann said he was surprised by 
the theory.

“When we started this project I was very skepti-
cal about the glaciation hypothesis,” he said in an 
e-mail. “But because of our excellent data set which 
supports this idea, I became more convinced.”

The researchers used data from the preserved

After being attacked in this parking lot on Feb. 9, stabbing victim Elizabeth Clevenstine managed to make 
her way toward Nordstorm before collapsing at the entrance. A suspect was apprehended minutes later.

Woman Stabbed at UTC Mall
By Reza Farazmand
Associate News Editor

A 24-year-old woman was stabbed 
in a midafternoon attack outside a 
department store in the Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC on Feb. 9. Police 
have apprehended a male suspect 
who they say stabbed the woman in 
the chest five times with an unknown 
object before fleeing the scene.  

The San Diego Police Department 
is currently holding the suspect, 42-
year-old Gerardo Pascual, in the 
San Diego Central Jail on the charge 
of attempted first-degree murder. 
Pascual was detained shortly after the 
stabbing occurred at a bus stop in the 
shopping mall and was identified by 
the victim, police said. 

The victim, Elizabeth Clevenstine, 
had just left her car on the second 
story of a parking structure east of 
Nordstrom and was walking toward 
the mall’s interior when she turned 
back to retrieve a forgotten item from 
her car. When she opened the trunk 
of her car at approximately 4:30 p.m., 
a male approached her from behind 
and grabbed her, attempting to drag 
her to the driver’s side of the vehicle. 
Clevenstine struggled with the man, 
and he stabbed her with an unknown 

instrument approximately five times 
in the hands, chest and abdomen 
before fleeing the scene.

Clevenstine made her way 
toward the second-story entrance 
of Nordstrom, where she collapsed. 
Store security alerted police, who 
arrived at the scene a few minutes 
later. 

Upon investigating the surround-
ing area, Lt. Mark Jones spotted 
Pascual, who fit Clevenstine’s descrip-
tion, and arrested him. 

Police said that the crime appears 

to have been an attempted carjack-
ing, though no motive has been con-
firmed.

Additionally, police have been 
unable to recover any weapon from 
the scene.

Clevenstine was treated at a local 
hospital following the attack and 
underwent surgery on Monday. She 
is expected to survive, police said. 

Pascual is scheduled to appear 
in court today. His attorney has said

Pressure 
Mounts 

for Preuss 
Review

UCSD staff members, 
community leaders  
continue push to reopen 
audit, though campus 
officials remain opposed.

By Matthew L’Heureux
News Editor

Facing an influx of concerned 
petitions from parents, staff and 
community leaders, UCSD officials 
maintain that they have no plans to 
reopen the contested Preuss School 
audit, which Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox continues to call a sound 
inquiry. However, other campus 
insiders — including ex-Principal 
Doris Alvarez and some members 
of the Preuss Board of Directors 
— are planning to release their own 
rebuttals to the audit in the near 
future, calling the campus’ unified 
response into question.

UCSD’s Audit and Management 
Advisory Services, which performed 
the initial six-month investigation 
after allegations of grade tampering 
surfaced last summer, released its 
findings in December. Since then, 
however, the audit has yielded mul-
tiple criticisms, including accusa-
tions of improper statistical analysis 
and biased interviews.

Following the audit, a group 
of five UCSD professors appealed 
to Fox and former Preuss Board 
of Directors Chair Cecil Lytle to 
reopen the investigation with the 
assistance of qualified statisticians. 
The group argued that the tran-
scripts found to have errors were 
not a random sample of all grades 
at the school, and therefore the 
auditors could not have adequately 
determined the scope of the grade 
changes.

“If the auditors had taken my 
Intro to Statistics course ... I would 
have failed them,” said research pro-
fessor Javier Movellan, one of the 
five who questioned the report.

Though he has kept mum over 
the issue since the audit’s release, 
Lytle expressed similar sentiments 
in a Jan. 19 e-mail obtained by the 
Guardian. In the letter, addressed 
to the group of professors, Fox 
and Vice Chancellor of Resource

House Votes 
to Tighten 
Leash on 
Lenders

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The House of Representatives 
approved a renewal of the Higher 
Education Act last week, which 
would place more stringent regula-
tions on the student loan industry, 
give colleges incentives to become 
more transparent in their financial 
transactions and focus on controlling 
the rising cost of college tuition. 

The HEA legislation, known 
as the College Opportunity and 
Affordability Act, passed the House 
by a vote of 354-58 — an overwhelm-
ing bipartisan majority illustrating 
cross-party sentiments concerned 
with the need to lessen obstacles for 
students seeking an accessible and 
affordable college education. 

Originally signed into law in 
1965, the HEA is the main piece of

COURTESY OF SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY
Two types of foraminifera, or preserved remains of marine organisms, 
were used to track changes in ocean temperature and evaporation.

remains of tiny marine organisms — known as 
foraminifera — dug from the western Atlantic 
seafloor. Changes in ocean temperature and evapo-
ration were tracked by examining the different 
isotopes of oxygen stored in the microfossils. 

The findings are also supported by research 
from other institutions that concludes the sea level 
in the Cretaceous Period fell by about 82 to 131 feet, 
indicating that water was removed from the oceans 
to form glaciers. 

However, Norris, a geology professor at SIO, 
said he is also wary of the results.

“I remain skeptical of the presence of substan-
tial ice in the Cretaceous,” he said. “I believe our 
data, but I have been around long enough to real-
ize that even solid evidence can sometimes have 
an alternative explanation I may not have thought 
about.”

Researchers have been unable to definitively 
confirm where the large sheet of ice could have 
existed in the Cretaceous or how it was formed.

“This is the most speculative part of this study,” 
Bornemann said. “We have only the vague idea that 
ice should have formed on Antarctica, which already 
was in polar position during the late Cretaceous.”

Norris postulated that the Cretaceous atmo-
sphere would likely hold more water, as evapora-
tion and precipitation cycles accelerate in warmer 
climates. 

“As long as the climate got cold enough for snow 
to survive … then there should have been plenty 
of snow to form ice,” he said. “Why there was not 
always significant ice in the Cretaceous is specula-
tive, but we think the answer likely has to do with See WARMING, page 7

Dept. of Radiology Opens 
New MRI Center in La Jolla

The UCSD Department of 
Radiology established a new imag-
ing facility, the UCSD Imaging Center 
of La Jolla, on Feb. 3. Specializing 
in magnetic resonance imaging, the 
center offers the public an opportu-
nity to access the services of UCSD’s 
world-renowned radiology faculty. 

“Patients will be able to access 
state-of-the-art imaging techniques 
developed by UC San Diego which 
are not widely available to the pub-
lic,” medical director of the new 
imaging center Stephen M. Dorros 
said in a press release.

MRI readings conducted at the 
new center will be supervised and 
interpreted by UCSD School of 
Medicine radiologists using the latest 
developments in image acquisition 
technology and techniques. 

“These techniques are important 
to the timely and accurate diagnosis 
of orthopedic and sports injuries as 
well as diagnosing the progression of 
diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mul-
tiple sclerosis, liver dysfunction and 
neurological disorders,” Dorros said.

  

Endowment Brings New 
Chair to History Dept.

The UCSD Department of History 
recently received a $500,000 endow-
ment to fund the establishment and 
research of a third chair in Greek 
history; $355,000 of that amount was 
donated by a single family. 

The third Greek history chair will 
be concerned with research relating 
to the period from 1768 to the pres-
ent. The two existing chairs cover 
the Byzantine era and ancient Greek 

history, respectively.
The endowment has allowed the 

Department of History to hire Thomas 
Gallant, a respected scholar of Greek 
history. According to chairman of the 
history department, Thomas Marino, 
Gallant’s presence will help to attract 
the best Greek history students in 
the nation.

Gallant’s qualifications include 
a doctorate in classical archaeol-
ogy from Cambridge University. He 
recently held the Hellenic Heritage 
Foundation chair of Modern Greek 
history at York University in Toronto.

College Big-Wigs Converge 
on San Diego for Annual Meet

The 90th annual meeting of the 
American Council on Education took 
place in San Diego this week, attract-
ing nearly 1,500 leaders in higher 
education to the yearly forum. Among 
the featured speakers at the event 
were Virginia Polytechnic Institute 
and State University President 
Charles Steger and editor-in-chief 
and co-founder of the Huffington 
Post Arianna Huffington.

Each year the event provides an 
opportunity for college and university 
leaders to discuss important policy 
concerns and exchange ideas for 
future practices. This year’s meeting, 
which took place at the Manchester 
Grand Hyatt Hotel downtown, was 
centered on the theme “Taking 
Charge of Our Future.” 

The highlights of this year’s event 
included a speech by Huffington in 
honor of the 35th anniversary of the 
ACE’s Office of Women in Higher 
Education, and Steger’s participa-
tion in a plenary session on campus 
security nearly one year after the 
shootings at Virginia Tech.

Council Gives a Lot, Discusses 
Little at Service-Themed Meeting

Philanthropy reigned supreme at last night’s A.S. Council meeting, while councilmembers heard 
pleas for cancer research and humani-
tarian relief but did not encounter any 
serious debates of their own.

Two representatives for UCSD’s 
upcoming involvement in Relay For 
Life took the floor to urge councilmem-
bers to participate in the April 12 event. 
The centerpiece of the fundraiser, orga-
nized by the American Cancer Society, 
will be a 24-hour relay on North Track 
during which participants make rounds 
through day and night in honor of 
people affected by cancer.

While expressing her passion for 
the event, Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Lorraine Leynes recounted 
the deaths in her 
immediate and 
extended family 
from cancer and 
asked  council-
members if they 
knew anyone 
affected by the 
disease, prompting 
most of them to silently raise their 
hands.

Leynes said that she hoped the event 
would raise up to $90,000.

On a similar note, Associate 
Vice President of Athletic Relations 
Stephanie Chang took the opportunity 
to promote UCSD’s involvement with 
“Row for the Cure” later this month. 
The fundraising event, sponsored by 
the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 
Foundation, is based around a series of 
timed races in Mission Bay with prizes 
for top finishers.

Athletes from UCSD as well as 
a boatload of councilmembers (two 
boats of A.S. would-be kayakers, to be 
exact), will be rowing away.

Kayaking and cancer research aside, 
two students from San Diego State 
University came to the meeting to 

introduce a new humanitarian endeav-
or. During the last week of February, 
SDSU will be hosting their “Under One 
Roof” campaign to celebrate multicul-
tural diversity and raise funds to sup-
port a devastated Ninth Ward family 
in New Orleans still recovering from 
Hurricane Katrina.

Through all the philanthropy efforts 
and the Katrina relief collection bucket, 
the council did cover some more mun-
dane topics.

Earl Warren College Senator Peter 
Benesch reported the results of a recent 
Parking and Transportation Services  
survey. Eighty percent of 260 respon-
dents protested proposed plans to build 
a new parking structure.

“A lot of people wanted parking but 
didn’t want to pay 
for it,” he said.

Benesch also 
said that a pro-
posed parking 
structure near 
Thornton Hospital 
was approved but 
that the university’s 

usage of the structure (and its portion 
of the bill) had been cut back from 40 
percent to 20 percent.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Guichet report-
ed that quarterly funding requests from 
student organizations weighed in at 
over $300,000, a figure that will have to 
be pared down considerably to match 
the $70,000 of available council funds.

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator 
Stephanie Usry solicited feedback on 
the recent overhaul of TritonLink in 
order to relay the comments back to the 
committee that led the redesign.

The council didn’t jump on the 
opportunity to critique UCSD’s newest 
hunk of XHTML, but Vice President 
of External Affairs Dorothy Young 
queried, “Can we ask them to change 
TritonLink back?”

Management and Planning Gary 
C. Matthews, among others, Lytle 
accused campus administrators of 
disregarding the board’s input when 
releasing the audit report.

“A greater concern for me, as 
board chair, is the campus disregard 
for joint governance displayed dur-
ing the rollout of the report,” Lytle 
said in the letter.

He alleged that three Preuss 
board members were not allowed 
to see the report prior to its release, 
despite Lytle’s scheduling of multiple  
appointments for them to do so.

“Consequently, major adminis-
trative decisions were made without 
benefit of faculty input,” Lytle said.

In the letter, he said the three 
board members are writing an arti-
cle that makes arguments similar to 
those of the five professors, which 
he expects to be published “soon.”

Lytle has since stepped down as 
chair for medical reasons, Movellan 
said. The board’s acting chair, pro-
fessor emerita of literature Susan 
Kirkpatrick, could not be reached 
for comment.

Though Fox said in a response 
that she had provided her “lead-
ership team” with a copy of the 
professors’ comments, university 
spokeswoman Dolores Davies said 
the administrators have no inten-
tions to resume the audit.

“The audit process is indepen-
dent and follows procedures that 
are routinely applied across the UC 
system,” Davies said.

Since the professors’ letter was 
made public, a group of eight parents 
that was involved in the Preuss PTA 
or parent council submitted its own 
petition to Fox and Lytle on Feb. 9.

“I feel very bad and guilty 
because we did not act before,” said 
former parent council President 
Maru Cham, who organized the 
petition. “With all my trust in the 
system, I felt the audit would [have] 

an acceptable result. I personally 
am just a mother. If these profes-
sors question [the audit], I support 
them.”

On Feb. 11, a group of local 
educators known as the Committee 
of Concerned Latinos submitted 
a similar appeal, which criticized 
the audit’s statistical analysis and 
“over-reliance” on the testimony of 
former Preuss Registrar Pearline 
Khavarian, whom Alvarez claimed 
to have terminated last April for 
changing her daughter’s grade on a 
transcript.

“The current audit is flawed and 
the negative impact it has had on 
Dr. Alvarez is not just and must be 
addressed in the appropriate man-
ner,” the letter read.

Alvarez met with the group of 
five professors last week to present 
her tentative rebuttal to the audit, 
Movellan said, which deconstructs 
the evidence against her point by 
point. 

He said Alvarez will ask that her 
rebuttal be officially added to the 
audit, and will make it public in the 
near future.

Julianne Singer, Khavarian’s for-
mer assistant and staunch advocate 
of her innocence, has requested that 
the UCSD Academic Senate charter 
its own inquiry into the matter over 
the last few months.

Academic Senate Chair Jim 
Posakony said that although he con-
siders the allegations very serious, 
all audit-related undertakings fall 
outside of the senate’s jurisdiction.

“The senate has neither the 
authority nor the resources to con-
duct such an inquiry,” Posakony 
said in an e-mail. “Like the exten-
sive Preuss School audit released in 
December, that is within the pur-
view of the campus administration.”

He said the senate’s main role at 
this point is to inform the adminis-
tration of the faculty’s diverse points 
of view and urge resolution of out-
standing issues.

“The UCSD faculty as a whole 
have a deep interest in the integrity 
and success of the Preuss School, 
and the senate will persist in repre-
senting and pursuing that interest,” 
Posakony said.

As part of the audit’s recom-
mendations, Matthews will com-
mission an external consulting firm 
to independently review the school’s 
operations. Davies said the selection 
process is ongoing.

that Pascual’s arrest was a result of 
mistaken identity. 

SDPD media relations man-
ager Mónica Muñoz said that the 
assault was the first time a violent 
crime such as this has occurred at 
UTC. According to police records, 
a combined 159 acts of violent 
crime occurred in the La Jolla and 
University City areas last year.  

Given the unpredictable nature 
of these crimes, police advise people 
to exercise measures of caution at 
all times.

“It’s a really good idea to take a 
self-defense class so that you’re able 
to defend yourself in this kind of situ-

ation,” Muñoz said. “It’s also a good 
idea not to shop alone, but to be with 
someone.”

She also recommended that peo-
ple use their cell phones responsibly, 
especially in remote areas such as 
parking lots.

“We also advise that you not talk 
on your phone when you’re by your-
self in a parking lot, because you need 
to be able to pay attention to what’s 
going on around you,” she said. “But 
it’s also important to keep your phone 
on you at all times in case you need to 
call for help.”

The bill was last fully reauthorized 
in 1998, and though it is usually 
renewed every five or six years, it 
has been under a series of exten-
sions since its last complete reau-
thorization.

Many of the amendments passed

higher education — fees that appear 
to be slated for a constant upward 
path. An October 2007 report from 
the College Board indicated that 
over the past five years, tuition and 
fees have increased across all sec-
tors.

“For too many years, the cost of 
a college education has been spiral-
ing out of control and closing the 
doors of higher education to aspir-
ing students,” the committee’s senior 
Republican member, Rep. Howard 
P. “Buck” McKeon (R-Calif.) said in 
a press release. “Despite a consider-
able federal investment, colleges and 
universities have continued to push 
tuition upward.”

The greatest fee increase at UCSD 
occurred in 1991-92, in which UC 
students experienced a 40-percent 
increase in fees as the state struggled 
with a massive economic recession.

“With the College Opportunity 
and Affordability Act, we can turn 
this trend around,” McKeon said. 
“To solve the college cost crisis, 
we’re empowering consumers with 
meaningful information about col-
lege costs and holding institutions 
and states accountable for keeping 
higher education affordable.”

Colleges that are in the top 5 per-
cent of their sector — such as pub-
lic, private, for-profit, two-year or 
four-year institutions — for tuition 
raises over a three-year period 
would be required to report the rea-
soning behind their increases to U.S. 
Department of Education Secretary 

Margaret Spellings, as well as form a 
“quality efficiency task force” to dis-
cover why their cost of attendance 
is rising more quickly than that of 
their peers. 

“We are redoubling our commit-
ment to college students and parents 
by reining in skyrocketing tuition 
prices and making our whole system 
of higher education far more con-
sumer-friendly,” House Education 
and Labor Committee Chairman 
Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) said 
in a press release regarding the leg-
islation.

The House also approved an 
amendment that requires colleges to 
report annually to the Department 
of Education the amount of their 
endowment spent on decreasing 
student fees. In addition, another 
amendment related to the rising cost 
of college attendance was passed that 
would require colleges to provide 
prospective students with informa-
tion about probable tuition costs 
over multiple years.

“The University of California 
supports making college admissions 
and financial aid practices more 
understandable to students and their 
families, so we are not at odds with 
respect to the basic thrust of what 
Congress is trying to achieve,” inter-
im director of UCSD’s Financial Aid 

Office Ann Klein said. “Until we 
see what finally emerges from the 
legislation, we can’t conclude that 
the new law will actually improve 
‘transparency,’ although we’ll do our 
best to provide meaningful informa-
tion to our applicants and students 
here at UCSD.” 

Other provisions illustrated con-
cerns over rising textbook costs, and 
would increase the amount of infor-
mation both textbook companies 
and colleges would make available 
for students about different price 
options.

Prompted by recent investiga-
tions into unlawful incentives from 
lenders to colleges, the Department 
of Education would have increased 
authority to regulate private student 
loans and put student loan com-
panies under more comprehensive 
scrutiny.

Changes to the Federal Pell Grant 
program would include making the 
funds available year-round instead 
of just during the academic year, as 
well as a $9,000 cap on the grant. 
Year-round scholarship aid would 
make the grant more available to 
nontraditional attendees, who may 
need funds outside of the regular 
school year.

In a speech at the National 
Community College Legislative 
Summit, Spellings derided the HEA 
as full of red tape.

“It fails to address the real con-
cerns of students and families, such as 
a broken and byzantine aid system,” 
she said. “They’re adding new layers 
of bureaucracy instead of emphasiz-
ing effectiveness and efficiency.”

Instead, Spellings promoted a 
more company-like approach to 
higher education, explaining that 
business leaders would have a better 
grasp on the best way to serve the 
consumer — college students.

OPINION
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2008

CONTACT THE EDITOR
Hadley Mendoza

opinion@ucsdguardian.org

As the Price Center expan-sion moves along slowly but steadily, Student Center 
habitues are left to wonder why con-
struction at their campus hub has 
been so slapdash. Although univer-
sity officials predict completion by 
Spring Quarter, and the courtyard 
and second-floor study lounge have 
recently opened, a walk around the 
center’s fence maze or a chat with 
some friendly construction workers 
reveals the sad reality: A complete, 
easily accessible Student Center is 
still a long way away. 

But finishing a little late isn’t the 
real issue here; the problem is how 
construction has been handled at the 
campus’ original hotspot.

While all sectors of Price Center 
have remained easily reachable 
throughout the duration of its expan-
sion, Student Center has become 
comedically difficult to navigate. But 
that makes sense — the offices in Price 
Center are those of campus officials 
and A.S. councilmembers, and the 
businesses, like the UCSD Bookstore, 
bring the UC Board of Regents direct 
revenue. So it’s a top administrative 
priority to keep Price Center open 
and manageable for students. 

Meanwhile, Student Center’s 
shops, the majority of which are 
grassroots student-run organizations 
— like three of the four co-ops and 
a few A.S. enterprises — have under-

gone a crippling blow to sales as stu-
dents, too frustrated to trek through 
the labyrinth of fences, sandbags and 
caution tape, have started to avoid 
that section of campus entirely. And 
the area’s upstairs offices are also hard 
to reach; at one point the only way to 
the second floor was by first walk-
ing down a random, steep dirt-and-
mulch-strewn hill at the complex’s 
back corner.

And the thick construction jungle 
isn’t just a hassle for Student Center 
regulars; the region is a campus gate-
way connecting the theater district 
and Revelle College to the rest of cam-
pus. With workers constantly chang-
ing fence arrangements, students get 
stopped up and even lost in the net-
work of dead ends en route to class. 
Meanwhile, those who choose to steer 
clear of the maddening maze create 
extra traffic in the region’s narrow 
passageways.

On top of all this, it’s question-
able whether the years-long hassle 
will even prove worthwhile. The Price 
Center expansion, if not totally effi-
cient, seems at least well-coordinated. 
But Student Center’s hard-hat sporting 
boys don’t seem to know which way is 
up — they spend a week pouring and 
perfecting a concrete walkway, only 
to tear it up a bit later leaving more 
fenced-off dirt and rubble, and redo 
parts of the second-floor patio three 
times before settling on an uneven 

surface not unlike the original. 
The center’s renovation promised 

structural and aesthetic upgrades, but 
the changes are already proving prob-
lematic; the complex’s newest build-
ing sprung paper-boat leaks during 
Fall Quarter’s rains and the first-laid 
wood paneling — left totally vulner-
able to weather, without paint or var-
nish — has become cracked and ashy 
before its sisters are placed.

Unfortunately, this joke situation 
is all too tragic — as completion is 
delayed once again, from this quar-
ter to next and predictably much 
later, students are left with a shoddy 
Student Center mess and a hefty con-
struction bill.

Dear UCSD,I want to wish you a happy Valentine’s Day. 
When normal, self-respecting 

people think of Valentine’s Day, they 
probably imagine star-crossed lovers, 
mountains of candy and the arrow-
shooting cherubs who make it all 
happen (even though they’re clearly 
armed and dangerous). 

Far from normal or self-respect-
ing, when I think of “the other V-
Day,” I see unrequited love, dejection 
and the fear that I am yet a year 
closer to fulfilling my third-grade 
prediction of leaving this earth a 
lonely, abject old man with only a 
studio apartment and 18 cats to his 
name — and I hate cats. 

My tone might smack of past 
inamoratas gone sour, and in a way 
that assumption is more or less in 
line with reality. But generally speak-
ing, I really do hate Valentine’s Day. 
Call me a walking cliche, but to me 
the holiday is nothing more than an 
overly commercialized and shame-
less excuse to mack on your beau or 
belle in public. It’s outright unforgiv-
able.

As if the general public were skep-
tical of love’s extent, on this day cou-
ples nationwide have taken to dispel-
ling any possible doubt with rounds 
of handholding, card swapping and, 
most damningly, their smug way of 
showing the world how just happy 
they are together — what’s the deal 
with that, anyway? 

In spite of it all, I just can’t shake 
my curiosity as to the origins of this 
lovefest. Tell me, was St. Valentine 
some sort of libertine? Did he become 
the patron saint of sexually transmit-
ted diseases or something? How did 
we come to celebrate this day of lov-
ers and what does St. Valentine have 
to do with it? Of Croatian Catholic 
stock, it’s embarrassing that I don’t 
know the answers to these questions; 
but I nonetheless decided to find out.

For over three decades, the remains of two ancient American Indian skeletons unearthed on 
campus property have been shuffled 
between museums, while UCSD and 
local Kumeyaay tribe members claim-
ing rightful ownership of the bones 
feud over their final resting place. 

In 1976, archaeologists discovered 
the 10,000-year-old remains in ques-
tion at University House, the historic 
UCSD chancellor’s residence located 
in the La Jolla Farms neighborhood 
directly adjacent to the main campus. 

Since then, however, the Kumeyaay 
tribe has demanded that the bones 
— which were discovered buried as 
part of a particular ritual in which the 
fingers of one of the skeletons were 
cut off and placed in the mouth — be 
returned to the tribe. According to tribe 
member Steve Banegas, the Kumeyaay 
treat human remains as loved ones, 
and rebury them according to a long, 
strict and intense religious process.

Banegas and other members, 
who formed an official repatriation 
committee in 1997, are armed with 

a federal law in their favor: the 1990 
Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act, which man-
dates that institutions receiving fed-
eral funding that are in possession of 
American Indian cultural items or 
human remains return them to their 
respective tribes.

There’s just one nagging obstacle 
in the tribe’s way: UCSD’s NAGPRA 
Working Group, chaired by anthropol-
ogy professor Margaret J. Schoeninger. 
In the face of three meetings this aca-
demic year alone — during the latest 
of which tribe members presented cul-
tural songs, stories, maps and history 
to emphasize their well-documented 
ancient ties to the La Jolla area — the 
working group continues to demand 
more time to review evidence of the 
bones’ relationship to the Kumeyaay.

Although it is important that 
the group accurately determines 
the remains’ proper affiliation — an 
admittedly weighty task, considering 
the historical and cultural significance 
of the discovery — how much more 
evidence does the tribe, which has lob-

bied for repatriation for over a decade, 
need to present before the bones are 
finally returned to their rightful own-
ers?

The working group must recog-
nize that these remains are considered 
sacred by tribe members. By bureau-
cratically delaying the bones’ repatria-
tion amid mounds of evidence sup-

porting their ties to the Kumeyaay, 
UCSD is adding yet another humiliat-
ing item to the immense list of injus-
tices endured by American Indians. 
The group should stop dragging its 
feet and return the remains to their 
rightful owners, before they end up 
accumulating more dust in yet anoth-
er museum’s storage room.

GUEST COMMENTARY 
By Alex Miller

During my term represent-
ing undergraduate students on the 
Transportation Policy Committee, I 
found it to be one of the most frus-
trating and trying experiences as 
part of student government.  

I have sat on numerous commit-
tees and worked with administra-
tors, faculty and staff on count-
less occasions, but have never had 

such trouble or felt so pessimisti-
cally about students’ position on 
an issue.

Every time we would tried to 
make advancements we ran into one 
of two problems: Either we could 
not convince the faculty and staff 
members (who outnumbered us) to 
support proposals, or, the commit-
tee would reach a decision only to 
have it ignored by superior adminis-
tration officials (an unfortunate side 
effect of being solely an “advisory” 
committee).  

Sadly, many of these issues could 
have been avoided if we had support 
from the student body, but every 
time we tried to reach out to the 
students and get them to support 
proposals, or even just voice their 
opinions, we would get almost no 
response.

I don’t have to tell anyone that 

there are serious problems with 
parking and transportation here at 
UCSD. Probably everyone has heard 

the predictions of dramatic price 
increases, a great reduction in the 
number of available spaces and a 

generally worse situation — and 
unfortunately they’re all correct.

Due to the natural limitations of 
parking and space available on cam-
pus, and the current rate of expan-
sion of buildings and other infra-
structure, we can expect decreases 
in the number of available parking 
spaces. Even worse, we are likely 
to lose the most convenient park-
ing spots, such as the recently lost 
North Campus Lot, and become 
more dependent upon distant lots 
such as East and Regents Parking.

So how do students go about 
improving the parking situation?  

The answer is pretty simple 
— they need to make their voices 
heard.

One of the biggest reasons that 
preference is given to staff and fac-
ulty is that whenever something 
happens they immediately flood 

Transportation and Parking Services 
and their own supervisors’ e-mail 
inboxes with complaints. This pres-
sure then leads T&PS to change its 
policies, even after they have been 
approved by TPC.

Students, on the other hand, 
relegate themselves to whining on 
Facebook and not actually working 
with administrators or making their 
voices heard. Even when attempts 
are made to reach out to students 
(such as by holding forums) only 
a few students show up (a recent 
parking forum had a total of four 
undergraduates show up, less than 
the number of T&PS personnel 
present). Decisions are made by 
those who show up — if students 
want the situation to improve, they 
must make themselves heard.

UCSD’s Parking Woes — Get Involved or Get Swindled

“Preference is given to staff and faculty [because] whenever something happens they 
immediately flood T&PS 

... with complaints.”

Committee’s former 
student council rep gives

university’s complex  
parking troubles.

Flops to the Revelle College planning 
committee for choosing an offensive name 

and theme for its semiformal — an event 
that should bring students together.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Using my best judgment, I turned to 
two trusty sources: my pious grand-
mother and another authority on all 
things Catholic, http://www.catholic.
org. Go figure. 

Apparently, St. Valentine was no 
philanderer. 

In fact, we aren’t really too sure 
who he was, as there are several men 
named Valentine in the pantheon 
of Catholic saints; many of whom 
were priests or hermits — hardly the 
ladies’ men one might expect from 
the namesake of a holiday dedicated 
to romance. 

In any case, it seems clear that 
whoever he was, he did something 
noble enough to score a spot on a 
very elite list of Catholics. 

In one account, St. Valentine was 
a miracle worker. Allegedly, the night 
before his scheduled execution (his 
crime being his faith, of course), he 
restored the eyesight of a small blind 
girl. In a letter to the girl, the saint 
to be asserted that she should never 
take the miracle for granted, signing 
the end with “from your Valentine,” 
leading some to wonder if this is the 
origin of Valentine’s Day cards.

But St. Valentine surely wasn’t 
romantically interested in the girl, so 

who came up with the lovey-dovey 
stuff we commonly associate with 
Valentine’s Day?  

You have none other than 
Geoffrey Chaucer to thank, who, in 
1381, composed a poem honoring 
the marriage between King Richard 
II and Anne of Bohemia, an event 
that took place on the honorary feast 
day of St. Valentine, which was then 
May 3. 

Because of this, Chaucer chose to 
include Valentine in his poetic hom-
age to the newlywed king and queen, 
inventively declaring St. Valentine’s 
to be the perfect day for a wedding, 
as it is the day on which birds choose 
their mates. Sure it is, Geoff. 

After the poet’s death, the feast of 
Valentine (when “every fowl cometh 
to choose his mate”) was moved to 
Feb. 14, apparently in a misguided 
attempt to mark the time when birds 
actually attract their mates. 

And if that seems crazy, yet 
another theory suggests that 
Valentine’s Day came as a result of a 
risque ancient Roman tradition. The 
Festival of Juno, which took place 
every Feb. 14, was a celebration dur-
ing which young Roman men drew 
names from a jar to see who their 
sexual partner would be for an entire 

Forget Roses, Give Your Sweetie the Plague This V-Day
▶ NOTA, from page 4 year. Pope Gelasius I, who unsur-

prisingly took issue with the festival, 
changed the rules so that instead of 
girls’ names, boys had to draw the 
names of Catholic saints whom they 
would emulate over the course of 
a year, and the festival became the 
Festival of Valentine. Major party 
foul, Gelasius. 

I suppose in the end, no one 
is really sure about the origin of 
Valentine’s Day, or even why it’s asso-
ciated with love. 

Bizarrely, in addition to couples, 
St. Valentine is the patron saint of 
epilepsy, plague, paper manufactur-
ing and beekeeping — so love isn’t 
even his main preoccupation. And 
on this day of romance, it isn’t mine, 
either. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’d gladly 
romance or serenade some fair maid-
en to whom I could dedicate this day 
of affection, but why bother with the 
hassle of courtship when I could just 
draw her name out of a jar? 

I don’t know about you, but if the 
United States really is the modern 
equivalent of ancient Rome, I think 
it’s high time we get ourselves a 
Festival of Juno.

Your loving Valentine,
Vincent Andrews 

Now I don’t want to get every-
one’s hopes up and say that the park-
ing situation will improve simply by 
sending a few e-mails. 

While it’s crucial for students to 
get involved, the fact is that the 
amount of space for parking is 
inherently limited — there is only 
so much free space on this campus, 
and that space is being increasingly 
taken by new buildings (such as 
North Campus Housing). The only 

solution to this problem is build-
ing parking structures which are 
extremely expensive (approximately 
$50 million each).

Therefore we are presented with 
three options: First, risk running 
out of parking spaces. Second, build 
numerous parking structures and see 
parking-permit prices rise to more 
than $1,000 per year. Or third, stop 
on-campus expansion (something 
that will obviously never happen). 

Unfortunately none of these 

By Staying Mum on Parking, Students Stand to Lose Big
▶ PARKING, from page 4 options are very good choices — all 

will require great sacrifice on every-
one’s part.

There are so many problems 
with on-campus parking and unfor-
tunately no easy solutions to the 
problem. 

The sad truth is that great sac-
rifices will have to be made in the 
coming years and due to students’ 
lack of involvement and participa-
tion they will almost certainly get 
the short end of the stick.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2008

Revelle College Council:  
No Disrespect Intended

Dear Editor,
The members of Revelle College 

Council would like to extend our sin-
cerest apologies to the UCSD and Asian 
Pacific-Islander communities. With 
our approval of this year’s semiformal 
budget, we did not intend to disre-
spect, hurt or offend anyone. In light of 
this, our council appreciates that mem-
bers of the API community joined 
us at our fifth-week council meeting, 
and we now realize the impact this 
theme has caused and appreciate the 
valid opinions and concerns that were 
brought before the council. Prior to 
this important discussion, the council 
was unaware that the event’s theme 
would upset and affect the entire cam-
pus, and perpetuate such negative ste-
reotypes and historical biases. 

Our council hopes that this is a 
first step toward increased interaction 
among campus leaders. It would be 
great to have everyone at UCSD  to 
work together to strengthen commu-
nication across campus. We know that 
there are students and leaders of UCSD 
who may be unaware of issues like 
these, but this is not an excuse to let 
them go unnoticed.

To the members of the API com-

munity, we thank you for volunteering 
to work with the Revelle Semiformal 
Committee to create an event that 
is appropriate and celebratory for all 
communities and for assisting us with 
a new event theme. Currently, our 
council plans to explore education-
al workshops with the help of A.S. 
Diversity Affairs. Also, we would like 
to host a case-study dialogue within 
our Revelle community for those who 
have been most closely involved and 
impacted by this issue with the goal of 
preventing such issues in the future.

We will be in contact with Student 
Affirmative Action Committee organi-
zations to find out about meeting times 
and events that we may attend to learn 
more as fellow students and leaders. 
And we look forward to continuing the 
dialogue that has begun. 

Again, our deepest and sincerest 
apologies. 

— Revelle College Council

Term Used for Dance 
Shouldn’t Be Controversial

Dear Editor,
I was surprised to learn that the 

use of the term “Orient” to refer to a 
place is controversial. The word is out 
of date but should not be seen as taint-

ed by any colonial doctrine. Unlike 
offensive words, the word doesn’t 
inherently demean. It was an ordinary 
word suited for whatever one thought 
about the Orient. In constructing their 
ethnocentric fiction, the complainers 
show their own cultural myopia. They 
must be ignorant of African-American 
history if they are so unclear about 
what constitutes a slur.

 Protecting Free Speech 
Easier Said Than Done

Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to Hadley 

Mendoza’s Feb. 11 opinion piece titled 
“To Protect Freedom, Students Must 
Read Fine Print.” I would like to begin 
by acknowledging the feedback put 
forth about our proposal. The idea that 
broad language leaves too much room 
for administrative decisions is a valid 
one, and something we have discussed 
throughout this process. We appreciate 
ideas; no policy should ever be accepted 
without critical examination. This story 
is an excellent space in which to begin a 
larger dialogue about what our commu-
nity thinks this policy should contain. 
This said, some clarifications should 

be made.
Let it be clear that we are not “con-

tent,” and we are not finished. The pro-
posal, instead of a perfect picture of 
our desired final product, serves as a 
compilation of principles that we will 
not allow to be interfered with. It is not 
a final draft, and we did not present it 
as such. We made it public this early 
because we want as much feedback as 
possible throughout the policy-writing 
process, unlike the administrators who 
proposed revisions last June.

Tara Ramanathan, Benjamin 
Balthasar and I are all fiercely com-
mitted to upholding the constitutional 
rights of our campus community. The 
University Centers Advisory Board 
Price Center Policy is unsettling to us, 
as are many policies at UCSD. While 
our policy proposal contains contro-
versial issues that should be addressed, 
I would hate to have those confused 
with the flaws of the Price Center Policy. 
In addition, we have addressed and 
integrated discussions of the Student 
Conduct Code and other relevant poli-
cies into this process by communication 
with the Student Regulation Revision 
Committee. What we want is one free-
speech policy that will protect everyone, 
instead of having things split up into so 
many different documents.

We cannot ignore the fact that 
free speech is complex and not eas-

ily dealt with. It seems simple at first: 
Protect everything possible. How to 
best accomplish this is a different story. 
While broad language leaves too much 
room for abuse, an “airtight policy” that 
Mendoza proposes might easily be con-
strued as a restrictive one as well. This 
is an issue that we continuously struggle 
with, and one that is in no way resolved; 
the line between specificity and restraint 
is a hard line to draw. Again, we wel-
come ideas, criticism and feedback. I 
invite anyone who would like to get 
more involved to contact me directly 
at carol.irene.southworth@gmail.com. 
Let this be the beginning of a produc-
tive and empowering conversation that 
leads to a policy that we all agree on.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

I f you’ve seen “X2: X-Men United,” you’ll remember its highlight is arguably the first 15 minutes, when a possessed Nightcrawler teleports through the White 
House, leaving behind a trail of chaos. If the scene proved 
anything, it’s that teleportation is freaking awesome. So 
you’d imagine a whole movie dedicated to just that would 
be equally amazing, right? Based on Steven Gould’s sci-
ence fiction novel, “Jumper” is proof that it’s possible to 
make teleportation seem like the lamest superpower ever 
conceived. 

The concept: David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is a 
jumper — that is, a super-being of sorts with the coveted 
ability to jump through time and space at the blink of 
an eye. Upon discovering his ability, he quickly starts 
using it to escape from an abusive childhood and live a 
life of extravagance by teleporting to exotic locales and 
robbing banks. When David finds himself stuck in 
the middle of a war between fellow jumpers and 
the Paladins — a group of religious zealots who 
have made it their goal to hunt and kill 
jumpers — the responsibility of his pow-
ers catch up with him.

“Jumper” desperately wants to be a 
superhero movie. There’s even a moment 
where David alludes to a comic series, 
“Marvel Team-Up,” paying tired hom-
age to the graphic novels that inspired 
the film. But while every other super-
hero movie benefits from the established 
mythos of the actual superhero, “Jumper” 
lacks such luxury. Perhaps this also stems 
from the fact that the supposed mythol-
ogy created for the jumpers is never actu-
ally fleshed out. There’s a moment where 
Griffin (Jamie Bell) a fellow-jumper, casu-
ally mentions to David 
that the war between 
jumpers and Paladins 
extends back to medi-
eval times, alerting the 
audience to an under-

modern love, no doubt about itmodern love, no doubt about it
a fter a recent string of movies that stretched the limits of indie tolerance to attempt the unconventional and ironic, it’s refreshing to snuggle into a musty movie theater seat and know exactly what to expect. That’s what “Definitely, 
Maybe” will deliver on Valentine’s Day — it’s a classic romantic 
comedy, enlivened by a vibrant cast, a fresh premise and writing 
that doesn’t stray far from its genre’s demands (a chuckle here, 
well-placed tearful revelation there). Clearly, English producers 
Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner (“Love, Actually”) are at home in their 
sentimental element.

The honesty of “Definitely” is what drives it far from the ditch of 
Lifetime flicks and empty date-crowd calories. It executes the rare 
feat of being both a mostly cheese-free romance, and funny without 
the “aww-shucks” schmaltz we’ve grown to expect out of February 
fare. Its breakout star is the every-woman’s fantasy husband, Ryan 
Reynolds, who has managed to peel away from past disposable roles 

(Van Wilder, anyone?) to expose an impressive sense of timing and 
subtlety as Will, the unassuming charmer. Throw in an 11-year-old 
with middle-aged poise (darling lil’ Abigail Breslin), and suddenly, 
the potential to move from cute to cutting is born.

When daughter Maya (Breslin) gets a sex-ed talk at grade school, 
it opens the door for more pressing questions for her pop — was she 
a mistake? Why do parents rehearse the act, if they don’t want the 
real thing? Then, the question that spirals into a fairytale of Woody 
Allen convolution: Who is my mother?

Realizing that the wide-eyed girl deserves an explanation, Will 
props Maya against her princess pillow, takes a deep breath, and 
delves into the nostalgic ’90s, when he moved to Manhattan fresh 
outta college, to work on Bill Clinton’s campaign. 

Along with some amusing retro references (Will is given a bread-
box-sized cell phone), we are introduced to three potential mothers: 
the blonde Wisconsin housewife Emily (Elizabeth Banks), the effer-

vescent and apolitical April (Isla Fisher), and the aspiring journalist 
Summer (Rachel Weisz) — all of whom play their roles expertly, 
endearing us to their individual quirks, talents, and extreme close-
up eye crinkles. A few cameos are equally skillful, like Kevin Kline’s 
gruff and brilliant Hampton Roth (a professor who equates two 
freshman lovers to one sophomore).

As Will sleeps with each woman, has his heart broken and sal-
vaged and endures various would-have-been, should-have-been 
encounters, the story comes to a few slow stumbles but never a 
screeching halt (thanks to punchy interruptions from Breslin). 
The second we start forgetting about one love interest, she snakes 
her way back into Will’s life, coloring it with yet another plot 
twist or self-doubting tangent. Pulling from reality, writer-direc-
tor Adam Brooks never grants us instant gratification, leaving us 
waiting in suspense up to the film’s anticlimactic, but nonetheless 
satisfying, close.

S top me if this one sounds familiar: Albert Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton and a stutterer who sees visions of King Solomon walk into a demented hunchback’s sanatorium. A few dead 
nurses later, they discover that the lynchpin of a society dominated 
by an “insane female psychiatrist” is the very same nuclear physics 
that threatens to blow the play’s protagonists sky high.

If this sounds confusing, think how “The Physicists” playwright 
Friedrich Dürrenmatt must have felt trying to squeeze overt cheap 
shots at scientists, psychiatrists, police officers, politicians and 
international-relations workers into two acts. The feat requires 
a certain physics of its own, and he certainly left director Lori 
Petermann with a daunting equation to balance. Thirty-odd years 
after the end of the Cold War, it’s at best a crapshoot to determine 
how much emphasis the play’s dated cultural references should be 
given, but Petermann selects an approach that admirably reflects 
Dürrenmatt’s own politics: Go big, or duck and cover.

While lesser actors could have easily floundered under the 
weight of such a loaded script — which curiously alternates 
between spot-on political satire and heavy-handed activist melo-
drama — Petermann’s cast does a commendable job avoiding the 
obvious pitfalls. As the aforementioned trio of quirky ex-physicists 
toys with Sam-Spade investigator Richard Voss (an appropri-
ately cartoonish Johnny Wu), the ballooning power of sanatorium

lying history between the warring factions. But as quickly 
as the information is introduced, it’s pushed aside. We 
could’ve had an exciting back-story about the links between 
the two groups, but we’re left to imagine the missing pieces 
for ourselves — which is unfortunate, since the mythology 
proves to be far more interesting than the movie itself.

Another problem with “Jumper” is that it never explic-
itly details the teleporting ability that it so heavily relies on.

Specific limitations are never completely addressed; for 
instance, there’s a scene when Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), 
the Paladin gang leader, breaks into David’s apartments and 
intercepts all of his jump sites. Does a jumper need jump 
sites to teleport? Or can he just teleport anywhere at any 
time, on a whim? Because the movie raises questions faster 
than it can answer them, we’re never fully sold on the power 
of the ability and never completely bought into the concept. 
Ultimately, we’re left to wonder why the Paladins even pose 
such a problem at all.

Liberties with the story also present themselves in the 
interaction between the characters. Particularly cringe-
worthy are the scenes between David and Millie (Rachel 
Bilson), his love interest. Despite an eight-year separation, 

both seem content with traveling together the same day 
they reunite, without ever questioning the other’s intent. 
The only genuine moments between David and Millie 
occur in the first few minutes, when the awkward tension 
still exists. But the genuine feel is lost from then on, and 
you’re left to wonder where David’s obsession with Millie 
actually stems from.  

Director Doug Liman has built a reputation on 
crafting entertaining action movies, with “The Bourne 
Identity” and “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” on his resume, 
so it’s all the more depressing that he’s succumbed to 
what’s essentially a CW teen drama with convenient 
teleportations as a hook. It’s only when the characters 
shut the fuck up and start using their ass-kicking tele-
portation powers that the movie starts to shine. These 
moments are few and far between, and we’re left to wit-
ness David teleport four feet in front of himself to open 
the refrigerator for the majority of the film.

If you still feel the need to watch a movie with tele-
portation,  pop in a copy of “X2” and watch the first 15 
minutes six times through. Unless you just want to see 
Rachel Bilson, in which case you could just buy the lat-
est copy of GQ (it’s more substantial, anyway).

operator Mathilde von Zahnd — think Cruella DeVil on a 
diet of bottled sunshine and unicorn blood — goes curiously 
unnoticed.

“It is I who decide who my patients think they are,” von 
Zahnd says with the subtlety of a playwright drop-kicking 
Sigmund Freud squarely in the atoms. “I know them far bet-
ter than they know themselves.”

At the heart of the parody lies the tormented genius 
Johann Wilhelm Möbius (Larry Herron), aptly named 
for the nonorientable mathematical surface that serves 
as a tidy metaphor for his mental ambiguity. Between 
twirling his robe’s tassels and blurting out a consistent 
stream of “Solomon,” we’re largely kept in the dark as to 
whether science has finally pushed dear old Möbius over 
the edge. 

This becomes a point of confusion during his shouting 
matches with ill-fated love interest Nurse Monika Stettler 
(Maritxell Carrero, who has nowhere to go but further over 
the top after a forceful entrance), as both struggle to out-
crazy each other in a frenzied crescendo toward a foresee-
able climax. Nonetheless, Herron’s straight-man-caught-in-
the-middle act pairs effectively with delightfully outlandish 
Herbert Beutler/Newton and Ernst Ernesti/Einstein (the 
superb Evan Powell and Walter Belenky), who pirouette and 
ponder their sanity with just the right amount of wit and gai-
ety — pun intended, as Petermann makes abundantly clear.

However, the standout scenestealer is UCSD-veteran 

Amalia Fite, whose eccentric von Zahnd somehow makes 
even the most tired shtick — such as a back-and-forth with 
Voss about labeling the patients as “murderers” or “assail-
ants” — survive the long refrigeration since Dürrenmatt’s 
1961 cheese buffet.

Accompanying an already complex script, Petermann’s 
attention to detail is perhaps the play’s greatest strength 
and most salient weakness. No actor ever idles during the 
performance — the sanatorium’s burly he-men guards even 
remain in the light to create ominous shadows over the 
loony chums — but it’s occasionally a challenge to focus 
on both the plot and the number of quirky goings-on in 
the background. The first act especially runs the risk of 
audience tennis-neck, as the extras’ engaging pantomimes 
during the opening scene encourage even more pronounced 
disorientation. But as the first act sprints through the jokes 
in the interest of advancing the story, the second revels in its 
surprising genre shift, as Dürrenmatt makes clear his closet 
aspiration to write 007 novellas.

Despite the play’s commitment issues, the cast manages 
to successfully grab the parallels between the nuclear war-
fueled paranoia of then and now, allowing them to drive the 
greater message home. The deliberate, reflective finale — in 
which many of our questions are finally laid to rest — gives 
the audience, much like the scientists, little choice but to 
“take refuge in prisons [we] built for [ourselves].”

“The Physicists” is currently playing at the Mandell Weiss 
Theater through Feb. 16.

O ne look at Ladyhawk’s group photo on the back cover of Shots and the curious consumer can make a somewhat educated guess as to what the contents of the album are 
going to sound like: sloppy beer-breath anthems for shaking 
your arms now and crashing to the floor later, sung by men with 
aversions to razors. Not a bad guess, actually, but not all true.

Yes, you can almost smell the Jack Daniel’s as singer Duffy 
Driediger desperately bellows out the chorus to the opening 
track, “I Don’t Always Know What You’re Saying,” but to call the 
saturated feedback whines of barely-tuned guitars and garbled 
verse-hollers sloppy is erroneous. The roughness gives Shots 
a charm not possible if the Vancouver foursome were sober 
and drumming to a studio metronome. It gives the record a 
certain panache that makes the group all the more comparable 
to fellow Vancouverites Neil Young & Crazy Horse, and adds to 
Ladyhawk’s Southern raucous rock.

Driediger and company are punch-drunk through the 

whole duration of Shots.  The nine tracks embody every type 
of boozehound,  alternately sounding like an angry drunk, a 
depressed drunk and that drunk you met the other night who 
gave you relationship advice while anxiously waiting for the 
crossing light to change.

Shots closes with “Ghost Blues,” a slow 10-and-a-half-min-
ute burn, climaxing at six minutes with a primal group scream, 
and finally ending in quiet acoustic arpeggios.  

The album was recorded in a gutted farmhouse in Kelowna, 
British Columbia by four grizzly men and that’s exactly what it 
sounds like. Never mind musical technique, Ladyhawk makes 
you want to shout down the hallways, with arms around a 
chum’s shoulder, finally collapsing on the couch after a strange, 
introspective, 39-minute ethanol-fueled trip.

recordings

T here’s a good band somewhere in The Eye the Ear and the Arm. Their debut album, Paths, has a certain raw, biting ferocity of idealistic musicians not yet jaded by the indus-
try leeches, the manic fans and the endless rotation of tour bus 
tires. And yet, there’s just an ounce of something missing. This 
unknown something — that oomph in layman’s terms — serves 
as a barrier to the aural landscapes of vocalist/bassist Derek 
Coburn, guitarist Darin Green and drummer J.D. Knotts, keep-
ing the act from truly penetrating the mind’s eye.

Paths opener “All Claws and Teeth” launches with a rush, 
albeit a slightly schizophrenic one. You can almost see Green’s fin-
gers run laps on his ax’s neck before settling on a steady rhythm 
for Coburn to swoop in with melancholic lyrics, almost reminis-
cent of (but not quite imitating) David Bowie. It’s transformative 
rock as a theater of the mind, the kind of 70’s style that discusses 
little green men building pyramids alongside the complexity 
of modern souls. Each song leads directly into the next, giving 
Paths the feel of an epic prog-rock recording — a concept album 

divided into various movements. The problem is, half the move-
ments can’t be distinguished from those that precede it, making 
the machine-gun drums and plucky, cerebral guitar repetitive. 
Those that do (“King of Thieves,” “I Give Praise”) hint at melo-
dies that, if varied and tinkered with volume-wise, could warrant 
some real head-tripping music.

And that’s what it looks like the band’s trying to strike at 
— the endless desire for music to explore and expose ourselves 
psychologically. The lyrics have it, the skill is there, there’s just 
something in the structure and execution preventing the tunes 
from becoming a full-body experience. But grand dreams and 
audio brilliance don’t occur overnight, and The Eye the Ear and 
the Arm have embarked on their own path of experimentation 
that, after taken off the burner and given a few taste tests, may 
prove breathtaking.

Sheryl Crow
■ Detours
A&M

I t takes a couple of spins to really get down with folk-god-dess Sheryl Crow. Her foot-
tappin’ beats and antiwar slo-
gans can easily rub you wrong, 
especially since countless other 
singer/songwriters are currently 
infiltrating the radio waves with 
heavy political jive. Crow deftly 
treads the line though, her light-
heartedness masking a deep-
seeded dislike for President Bush 
and sky-high petrol prices. 

As she strums her way 
through the aptly titled track, 
“Gasoline,” her beef with the 
man in charge is made none 
too subtle with, “You got the 
bastards in Washington/ afraid 
of popping the greed vein.” With 
oodles of scathing lyrics, there’s 
no mistaking the miffed under-
tone of Detours for a wimpy 
bureaucratic taunt.

Political dogma aside, Crow 
has a lot more going on than 
activist finger-pointing and 
hippy blues. The second half of 
her album becomes an intimate 
sit-down in the vein of VH1’s 
“Behind the Music” (minus the 
career stagnation) with a woman 
who has been through some seri-
ous shit. From battling cancer to 
breaking off her engagement to 
Lance Armstrong to adopting a 
baby, Crow uses her cutting wit 
and lean voice to remind us she’s 
still our resident badass.

Back in cahoots with for-
mer collaborator Bill Bottrell, 
the bulk of Detours is a throw-
back to the grittier days of her 
first album, Tuesday Night Music 

Club. Some of the recordings 
even flirt with Johnny Cash 
vibes as the crackle of back-
ground noise and conversational 
vocals cook up a twangy coun-
try-pop sandwich. But after all 
her stylistic meanderings, Crow 
still has her signature guitar 
jaunts into Sunshineville. Jams 
like “Motivation” talk smack 
about the privileged few while 
maintaining her zippity-do-dah 
musical mentality. Even as she 
belts out “Got no reasons to 
bitch/ ain’t no parties I miss” 
like an enthusiastic Gen-Y yup-
pie, she artfully separates herself 
from the subjects she’s mocking 
by poking fun at the three-piecer 
lifestyle.

Crow also explores darker 
periods in her life with “Diamond 
Ring” and “Make It Go Away” 
which talk about losing love to 
a fat rock and bonding with 
an ex over cancer. These songs 
mark the confessional side of 
the record, where Crow turns 
off the preach and gets a little 
sentimental. 

But either due to a media 
blitz or the inherent awkward-
ness of celebrity confessionals, 
her disclosures only occasion-
ally ring true. It becomes hard 
not to feel emotionally coerced 
when she gives Lance the kiss-
off or Bush the bird. Sure, Crow 
is still fierce after all this time, 
but a little mystery never hurt 
anyone.

Cryptacize
■ Dig That Treasure
ASTHMATIC KITTY

I f you’ve ever wondered what it would be like if the flower-power music of the ’60s and the grudgingly infectious tunes of Walt Disney made sweet, musical love, look no further than 
the whimsical, psychedelic sounds of Cryptacize.

Despite the band’s sinister moniker, there’s no guitar shred-
ding grunge or pulsating bass to be found anywhere in their 
debut album, Dig That Treasure. In fact, with elementary lyr-
ics like “Every note is an unfinished song/ we’re all in cosmic 
sing-a-long,” you’ve wondered if you accidentally stepped into 
after-school special. 

But don’t let the lullaby vocals fool you; underneath these 
simple melodies is a funky, multifaceted sound. Though classi-
fied as pop, the album defies labels with its unpredictable har-
mony, often changing pitch and pace mid-song, like TV stuck 
on channel surf. With broad electric guitar work here (“We’ll 
Never Dream Again”), and a condensed drumbeat there (“The 
Shape Above”), it’s almost improvisational, with odd instruments 
blended together like knick-knacks from a junkyard. It should 
feel discordant or erratic, but the melodious vocalization of lead 
singers Nedelle Torrisi and Chris Cohen guide us along on the 
escapist experience (no hallucinogenic drugs necessary).

I n a country of Starbucks-addicted, nine-to-fivers who can’t focus past a couple Jessica Alba hip lunges, there are those whose job it 
is to cater to a 30-second mentality: commercial 
jingle composers. And, although a few snip-
pets may squeeze out some impressively catchy 
tunes, it’s fun to wonder what these guys do in 
their spare time. For fire-head producer Rafter 
Roberts, it’s seasoning a vast musical concoc-
tion, compiled over years of urban ambling and 
DJ collabs. This guy must beat bongos until his 
hands bleed, for how prolifically he can pop side 
projects.

In his latest album, Sex Death Cassette, the 
self-proclaimed “nice uncle” isolates bare-bones 
percussion, peppering lyrics here and there like 
last-minute spices to a hearty orchestral brew. 
Perhaps Rafter is reminding us that he’s more 
than an empty jingle jammer — he was, after 
all, a commie-protest band member at a green 
point in his life. 

But Rafter hasn’t left behind his attention-
deficit day job entirely. Cassette consists of 19 
(yes, 19) one-minute cliffhangers that — like 
any good burger commercial — leave you soul-
stripped and salivating for more. Crosshatch 

that type of restless indecision with Elliot Smith-
y vocals and similarly sedative instrumentation, 
and you get a short-lived (albeit enjoyable) head 
massage. It’s kind of like getting shampooed at a 
hair salon; it never lasts long enough. 

Maybe that’s just Rafter’s style, though — the 
songs that do persist past a hundred seconds are 
the least remarkable of the bunch. “Zzzpenchant” 
isn’t exactly the best song to kick-start an album, 
with its pokey brass farts and sleepy one-liner 
lyrics (“The word is black and blue/ I’m tired of 
being abused”). “Love Time Now Please” is sort 
of cool, in a marching-band-after-hours way (it’s 
no coincidence that Sufjan is his label buddy). 
But, honestly, it gets stale after the first minute 
— the cutoff, it seems, on Rafter’s inventiveness.

There’s really only so much tinny drum 
clopping and background electric whirring that 
one can take. No matter how hard Rafter tries to 
make his selection feel varied with a  banjo inter-
ludes or jazzy sax solos, his efforts inevitably end 
like a particularly long commercial break: with a 
vague sense of relief.

Bon Iver
■ For Emma, 
Forever Ago
JAGJAGUWAR

A fter the breakup of long-term band DeYarmond Edison in 2006, Justin Vernon pulled a Thoreau, retreat-
ing to the woods of Northern Wisconsin 
and dedicating four cold months to soli-
tude and what artistry that might imbue. 
A round of seasons later and voila: Bon 
Iver, a purposefully poor play on the 
French for “good winter,” emerges, For 
Emma, Forever Ago in tow.

This is wallowing music — the kind 
that encourages its listeners to curl up 
alone in their rooms. It’s the kind of 
music that amplifies not emotion itself, 
but rather dwells on memories, encour-
aging a reflection on the old. As long as 
wallowing provides a muse, however, its 
associated activities aren’t without value.

Acoustic guitar taps compose most 
of the debut’s rhythmic structure. 
Combine this consistent tread-light-
ly beat with an imperfect bare-cabin 
silence or wailing trumpet/slide guitar/
whistling in the background. Then add 
dozens of layered vocal harmonies — all 
one guy — merging to create something 
reminiscent of a southern spiritual in 
the foreground. 

The completed effect is a power-
fully delicate, lonely sort of sound that 
at any one time can evoke Andrew 
Bird (“Blindsided”), Sigur Ros (“Lump 
Sum”) or that down-by-the-river song 
from “O Brother, Where Art Thou” 
(“The Wolves [Act I and II]”) while also 
maintaining command of an essential 
aesthetic that’s totally the recluse’s own. 
It’s worth every miserable moment.

Bon Iver will play at the Che Cafe on 
March 19.

WHEN ROCKING THE JOYSTICK, 
DITCH THE ONE-MAN BAND

T o the general public, the argument over Rock Band and Guitar Hero may seem trivial, since the two are simply different 
games in the same genre. But for those who 
know better, the two brands represent not 
only a schism among many music gamers 
but also an epic feud between two studios. 
The drama began when Harmonix, the mas-
termind developer behind the Guitar Hero 
franchise, split with publisher Red Octane 
and teamed up with Electronic Arts to create 
Rock Band, a multi-instrument rhythm game 
that added drums and vocals to Guitar Hero’s 
guitar. Red Octane, unable to let Guitar Hero 
go, decided to pair with Activision to con-
tinue releasing more iterations of the well-
known series, thus sparking bitterness from 
both studios. Essentially, the story is one of a 
fantastic marriage and a 
messy divorce that forces 
unfortunate gamers to 
choose between the two 
pricey brands.

It’s not much of a 
secret that Guitar Hero is 
one of this decade’s most 
successful videogame 
franchises. The series 
signified both a gam-
ing and cultural revolu-
tion. It was the bestselling game franchise of 
2007, setting an NPD-group record by raking 
in a whopping $820 million and allowing 
Activision to beat out corporate mega-behe-
moth Electronic Arts to be the No. 1 gam-
ing software publisher of ’07. Even as you 
read this, Guitar Hero III is flying off the 
shelves faster than a lone hiker fleeing from 
a moose. 

In contrast, Rock Band is relatively 
unknown, selling a comparably meager 
360,000 games in its first week in November 
and not even cracking the top 10 in sales 
for December. If there’s any battle between 
the two brands, it seems obvious that Guitar 
Hero is winning. But as history has prov-
en repeatedly, commercial success does not 
equal long-term success.  

To put it bluntly, Activision screwed the 
franchise by handing it over to Neversoft, 
the gaming studio that develops the long-
running Tony Hawk series. While Harmonix 
has always been about combining music 
with games, Neversoft has always been about 
just making games. With Guitar Hero III, 
Neversoft tried to incorporate gaming ele-
ments that ultimately proved detrimental. 
First, as if to please only the hardcore demo-
graphic, designers upped the difficulty. What 
was easy became medium, what was medium 
became hard, what was hard became expert 
and what was expert became holy-fuck 
impossible. 

There’s absolutely no joy in finishing the 
game anymore; trying to beat the final brack-

et is like trying to jerk off an acorn: frustrat-
ing and pointless. Second, they tried to make 
it competitive. 

Let’s be frank: Guitar Hero was never 
about the game aspect nor was it ever about 
competition; people played Guitar Hero to 
play the music, to feel like a rock star. Proving 
you can play guitar better than someone else 
is as pathetic in virtual reality as it is in real 
life. Third, they implemented Battle Mode, 
which is quite possibly the series’ worst fea-
ture yet and the most frustrating experience 
next to eating soup with a fork. Every battle 
is a crapshoot that depends on who gets the 
power-up first, unless you’re playing against 
the computer, in which case you’re better off 
against an army of Terminators. 

If Guitar Hero III proves anything, it’s 
that a franchise is only 
as good as its creators. 
While Guitar Hero III 
fails to be the compelling 
next-generation music 
experience that many had 
hoped for, Harmonix’s 
Rock Band aims to deliv-
er the next step in music 
interactivity. Essentially, 
by adding other instru-
ments to the successful 

guitar peripheral, Rock Band delivers not just 
different gameplay styles but also a means to 
play with other people. Unlike most rhythm 
games, Rock Band was designed to be a mul-
tiplayer experience, to be enjoyed by gamers 
and nongamers alike. 

Yet the true beauty of Rock Band lies not 
in its compelling gameplay but in its poten-
tial: it’s essentially developed to be the iTunes 
of videogames. With the licensing support of 
MTV and the financial backing of Electronic 
Arts, Harmonix has unfettered access to 
countless catalogues of music. With songs 
available for download every week and the 
promise of full playable albums in the near 
future, Rock Band is not just a defined gam-
ing experience; it’s the desired drums, guitar 
and karaoke game people want it to be.

So I guess the question that’s been posed 
to us gamers by this unfortunate divorce is if 
we’re buying a game for its quality, for being 
a popular brand, or both. Though Guitar 
Hero has undeniably been the more power-
ful franchise for the past couple years, Rock 
Band is ultimately proving to be the more 
compelling experience. While Guitar Hero 
III is by no means a bad game, it’s incred-
ibly underwhelming when pitted against its 
multilayered brethren. Unless you’re one of 
the lucky few who has the money to buy both 
games with their respective peripherals, I’m 
sure it won’t take long to convince even the 
most diehard Guitar Hero fans to invest in 
one Rock Band rather than 20 other future 
Guitar Hero variations.

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2008



1-1, that match was a crucial one for 
us to take the lead entering singles 
play.  The match was a tremendous 
battle throughout that could have 
gone either way when the score was 
tied at seven.  I’m impressed with 
how two freshmen were able to make 
the plays that were needed to win the 
match.”

Energized from the way their 
freshmen fought, the Tritons came 
out firing on all cylinders when sin-
gles play started.  
Even with the 
injury to Rubens, 
the team’s usual 
number-two or -
three singles play-
er, the Tritons had 
no trouble adjust-
ing their lineup.  
Rubens injured 
his foot, and has 
had trouble play-
ing at full strength 
for the last week.  
He toughed it out 
during doubles 
play, but elected to sit for singles.  
Even though his injury forced each 
player, except number-one sopho-
more Bijan Moallemi, to play a spot 
higher than normal, UCSD had no 
trouble with the Broncos, winning 
each match in straight sets.

Moallemi got things going at the 
top spot with a 7-5, 6-2 win over 
the Broncos’ top player, Joshua Lau.  
The sophomore started slow in the 
first set, but found his groove early 
in the second to blow past his oppo-
nent. At number two, junior Kazumi 
Negishi got past Salvador Romero by 
a score of 6-3, 7-6 (7).  Negishi fought 
through a difficult second set, where 
he had to save six set points, but man-
aged to win in straight sets thanks to 
a brilliantly played tiebreaker.  

“It was tough to get my game 
going; the conditions were pretty 
tough and I couldn’t find a rhythm 
out there,” Negishi said. “I’m glad I 
was able to win the match in two sets 
because it would have been difficult 
to come back and have to play a third, 
especially with the conditions.”

Meister completed a perfect day 
at the courts when he defeated Jeffrey 
Vachirajongkol by a 7-6, 6-2 score.  
Like Moallemi, it took Meister a little 
while to find his groove. But he found 

it after winning the 
first set tiebreaker, 
and the senior was 
able to impose his 
game on his oppo-
nent.  Sophomore 
Vince Nguyen

by sending 13 batters to the plate in a 
decisive nine-run sixth inning.

Sophomore shortstop Vance Albitz, 
who hit his first career grand slam 
against the Antelopes last season, 
pounded the Antelopes out of the 
leadoff spot, scoring three times on 
two hits, including his second career 
grand slam that sealed the win in the 
sixth inning.

“That happened to be a coinci-
dence because I’m not a home run 
hitter,” Albitz said. “The great thing 
about hitting up top is I have Cantele 
hitting behind me and then Imeson 
behind him so I’m getting a lot to hit 
right now.”

After surrendering the tying run, 
though unearned, Shibuya came 
back in the top of the seventh and 
shut down the Antelopes. He earned 
the win with three innings worth of 
work, in which he allowed only one 
run and struck out two batters.

After the offensive fireworks in 
the series opener, UCSD pitchers 
dominated in the doubleheader on 
Feb. 9. Freshman Guido Knudson 
struck out six Antelopes in six innings 
while allowing only five hits and one 
unearned run in a 7-1 win in the 
first game and then rested his arm 
as he watched junior Trevor Decker 
deliver five strong innings in a 6-2 
win. Both starters delivered and had 
their wins nailed down by UCSD’s 
stellar bullpen. Sophomore Kirby St. 
John went the final three innings of 
the first game to pick up the save, 
while senior co-closers Keith Noe 
and Nick Rodieck turned in one-hit 
scoreless innings in the eighth and 
ninth innings, respectively.

“Right now, I see my role as basi-
cally getting us to Rodieck,” Noe said. 
“My job is to come in the seventh or 
the eighth and get us to him with a 
lead or within a run or whatever it 
has to be. He’s by far the most consis-
tent pitcher on our team and I think 
that’s why he’s there to anchor us at 

the end.”
In the series finale on Feb. 10, the 

Tritons completed the sweep behind 
three-run homers from senior desig-
nated hitter Chris Franco and junior 
first-baseman Matt Cantele. 

In the 9-4 win, UCSD did not get 
a good start out of Derek Barham, 
who allowed six hits and two runs, 
both of which came in the first, over 
three innings. Down 2-0 in the bot-
tom of the third, UCSD took the lead 
after an RBI groundout by Cantele 
and Franco’s three-run shot. 

After UCSD added another run in 
the bottom of the fifth, the Antelopes 
chipped away with another two runs 
in the sixth to pull within one at 
5-4. But like in the opener, UCSD 
responded with a big inning, scoring 
another four runs due in large part to 
Cantele’s blast.

“Obviously a home run is the best 
thing in baseball,” Franco said. “It 
silences the crowd, it silences the 
other team, it’s something that’s really 
powerful. Those two blasts were pret-

ty big because it was a pretty close 
game until mine and Cantele’s put the 
nail in the coffin.”

Shibuya earned another win for 
his 2.1 innings of work in relief of 
Barham. Noe and Rodieck were again 
stellar as UCSD’s one-two punch in 
the late innings, as Noe worked the 
seventh and Rodiek nailed down the 
win with two innings of scoreless 
work.

With the sweep, the Tritons 
improve to 7-2 and earn a top 25 
ranking again as they head into their 
final four-game nonconference series 
at home, where they will face Barry 
University from Feb. 15 to Feb. 17. 
Then, the CCAA schedule begins 
with two games against Cal State San 
Bernardino in San Diego on Feb. 15 
and 16 and a doubleheader against 
the Coyotes in San Bernardino on 
Feb. 23, which will be the Tritons’ 
first road games of the year.

HOT CORNER

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

FENCING — The UCSD fencing team 
used momentum generated at the diffi-
cult Northwestern Meet two weekends 
ago to crush its three opponents — Cal 
Tech, Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine 
— on Feb. 10. The four teams had 
already met earlier this season in a 
preseason warm-up that UCSD won 
handily, but the margin of victory was 
still nowhere near as wide as it was 
this time. The Tritons steamrolled their 
competition, with the men beating Cal 
Tech 25-2, Cal State Fullerton 24-3 and 
UC Irvine 26-1, and the women defeat-
ing Cal Tech 24-3, Cal State Fullerton 
23-4 and UC Irvine 24-3.

The dominating wins are made 
even more impressive by the fact that 
UCSD won the meet without most of 
its top fencers. In a smaller meet like 
this one, competing fencers from other 
schools are usually not as highly ranked 
as Triton fencers, so sending UCSD’s 
top fencers against these schools would 
have created a lose-lose situation. 

According to senior Chelsea Ambort 
of the epee squad, if a higher ranked 
fencer fences a lower ranked player, it 
brings down their strength points even 
if the better fencer wins. This system 
is designed to give unranked fencers 
a chance of qualifying for the NCAA 
Regionals. Regardless of the fact that 
their best fencers took the weekend off, 
the Tritons were still able to win due to 
the team’s depth.

“Even without our starters compet-
ing that day, we rocked the competi-
tion,” Ambort said. “It just shows how 
strong of a team UCSD fencing is, 
we can put our alternates in and still 
sweep the day.”

The ranking system, coupled with 
the lesser competition at the meet, gave 
UCSD the opportunity to give match 
time to some fencers who had not 
competed much this year. Even with a 
new lineup, the team was able to win 
relatively easily with all of the newer 
players performing well.

“After all of these substitutions, I 
didn’t know what to expect,” sopho-
more epee Sean Blum said. “It turns 
out that the result barely changed; all 
of the subs did a fantastic job. We were 
working really well together, giving 
each other advice on the strip, that 
really helped us dominate.”

A major highlight of the meet was 
the play of sophomore sabrist Bryan 
Kim, who won 5-1 over the weekend 
and remains the only undefeated fenc-
er on the entire UCSD squad. Kim and 
the rest of the Tritons will next travel to 
the Intercollegiate Fencing Conference 
of Southern California. 

“[The IFCSC] is going to be impor-
tant, but regionals is our main con-
cern,” junior foil Zitin Kachru said. “It’s 
worth 60 percent of our NCAA season 
and most of our focus is on that already, 
and not so much on the IFCSC, since 
hardly any of those matches count for 
NCAA points.” 

Blum agreed with Kachru, choos-
ing to work toward regionals as their 
main source of motivation.

“I think that it will only be impor-
tant as a training opportunity and as 
a morale builder, as far as regionals 
are concerned,” Blum said. “We’re not 
fencing any of our NCAA opponents 
that day. Of course, IFCSC is impor-
tant for its own sake. It will be the final 
event in a great season, and we cannot 
get lazy if we want to win the gold in 
conference.”

BASEBALL — With one more four-
game series left before the start of 
conference play, the No. 14 UCSD 
baseball team is on a roll, sweeping 
Grand Canyon University by out-
scoring the Antelopes 37-13 in four 
games at Triton Baseball Field from 
Feb. 8 to Feb. 10.

The Tritons began the season 
ranked 15th in Division II, but fell 
out of the top 25 after splitting a 
series against Western Oregon. But 
since that disappointment and the 
repercussions in the rankings, UCSD 
has won five straight games and looks 
poised to tackle its division rivals in 
the competitive California Collegiate 
Athletic Association when league 
play starts on Feb. 21.

“Especially since we came out of 
the gates kind of slow with Western 
Oregon, getting a sweep against a 
team like Grand Canyon was vital,” 
senior designated hitter John Franco 
said. “We have a lot of young guys 
and to gain some sort of momentum 
and confidence for them was huge.”

The weekend series against the 
Antelopes started on Feb. 8 with 
an offensive battle that ended in a 
15-6 UCSD win. Leading 6-5 after 
five innings, the Tritons saw their 
lead vanish when GCU scored an 
unearned run on freshman relief 
pitcher Tim Shibuya in the top of the 
sixth inning. But UCSD responded 
in a big way, breaking open the game

MEN’S TENNIS — The sixth-ranked 
UCSD men’s tennis team had its long-
awaited home opener when it hosted 
conference rival Cal Poly Pomona 
at North Courts on Feb. 13. After a 
tense start in which the Tritons had to 
struggle to earn a 2-1 edge in doubles, 
UCSD dominated singles play, sweep-
ing every match to earn an emphatic 
8-1 win. Despite the dominant win, 
coach Eric Steidlmayer insisted that 

his nationally ranked team isn’t play-
ing to its full potential yet.

“We’re not playing at a tourna-
ment-type level yet,” Steidlmayer 
said. “Granted, our team has been 
hit hard with some injuries and it 
has forced me to mix up the lineup 
and use different combinations to 
see what works. This has forced me 
to put members of our team in posi-
tions they aren’t accustomed to. Our 
guys have been competing hard in 
their matches, and playing great in 
practice, but it hasn’t translated on 

the court yet.”
After the Tritons’ number-one 

doubles team — seniors Eric Rubens 
and Blake Meister — took out the 
Broncos’ duo of Joshua Lau and 
Salvador Romero by the comfort-
able score of 8-4, both the number-
two and -three doubles matches were 
nail-biters. In number-two doubles, 
UCSD sophomores Alex Placek and 
Chad Becker battled back from a 7-
4 deficit and saved multiple match 
points before finally succumbing to 
Jeffrey Vachirajongkol and Joe Madoo 

of Cal Poly Pomona, 8-6. Freshmen 
Alex Edstrom and Armaun Emami 
mustered up a crucial win at the 
final doubles spot, defeating Jackie 
Vachirajongkol and Don Evangelisa 
by a 9-7 score. The match was a 
back-and-forth affair that demon-
strated the intensity and fight that 
Steidlmayer has praised his team for.

“I was proud of the way Edstrom 
and Emami were able to compete out 
there,” he said. “With the score at
