Looking to the Fall 
Writing Workshops May 
Face 80 Percent Reduction 

By NOAH SALZMAN 
Contributing Writer 

In the arcane world of account-
ing, it is possible for the literature 
writing department at UCSD to 
lose 80 percent of its writing work-
hops next fall quarter, although 

the administration claims it has 
made no cuts in the program. 

In the fall 1989 Course Catalog, 
there are only 10 upper-division 
and two lower-division writing 
workshops listed which, accord-
ing to sources in the department, 
have made it difficult for seniors 
with a literature writing major to 
register for enough writing work-
shops to graduate. 

A year ago, the fall 1988 catalog 
listed fourteen upper-division and 
five lower-division writing work-
shops. 

According to Susan Kirkpa-
trick, chairperson ofthe literature 
department, the department must 
give priority in choosing classes to 
graduating seniors. Therefore, 
non-majors are not allowed to 
register for writing courses until 
after all seniors and junior litera-
ture/ writing majors have had a 
chance to do so. 

One cause of the declining 
numbers of classes is linked to the 
retirement of two UCSD litera-
ture professors. 

Like many professors, they once 
forfeited large portions of their 
salaries back to the department 
because they received yearly out-
side research grant which allowed 
them a one- to two-quarter par-

tialleave of absence without pay. 
Since they have retired and no 

longer forfeit portion of their 
salary, the money is no longer 
available for redi tribution and 
will be u ed to hire their replace-
ments. 

Those particular losses ac-
counted for almost half of the 
missing workshops for the fall 
quarter. 

Literature / Writing Advisor 
Michael Davidson feels that 
"we've relied too much on soft 
[unpredictable] funds" to finance 
these workshops and Kirkpatrick 
added that "we're looking for 
some long range planning" to 
fund visiting writers. 

When professors apply for 
research money through such 
channels as the Rockefeller or 
Guggenheim grants, they are not 
notified as to their grant status 
until after the beginning of the 
spring quarter, just prior to the 
publication of the course catalog. 
. This, according to department 
sources, does not leave enough 
time for the department to decide 
on what courses it can afford to 
offer, based on its knowledge of 
how much money will come back 
to the department in salary sa-
vings. 

The unexpected retirement of 
the professors added to the loss in 
funds for writing workshops that 
went along with the lack of grant 
awards for next year. 

Although the crisis was imme-
diately acted upon by literature 
department personnel, it appeared 

See WRITIN G, page 3 
The events, part of a Cultural 

Unity Day of Awareness, were 
sponsored by the African Ameri-
can Student Union (AASU), the 
Asian Pacific-Islander Student 
Alliance (APSA), Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan 
(MEChA) and the Women's Re-
source Center (WRC). 

"We've been trying and putting 
a lot of effort into attracting 
underrepresented students to 
UCSD," he said. "We can do 
more than we're doing, but we're 
doing an awful lot, and we're 
doing better." 

UCSD Awarded 51.2 Million Grant 

The demonstrators first 
marched from Central Library to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson's 
office, led by students carrying a 
black coffin labeled "Death to 
racism." 

As they marched, the protes-
ters, numbering over 100, chanted 
"Racism has got to go." 

At the Chancellor's office, sev-
eral students presented a list of 
demands to Vice Chancellor Joe 
Watson and Associate Chancel-
lor Robert Richie as marchers 
outside chanted "Racism will burn 
in hell." 

The demands included the 
implementation of ethnic and 
gender studies requirement , de-
partmental status for ethnic and 
gender studies, and "retention 
and recruitment aimed at student 
and facultv of color." 

According to MEChA member 
Georgina Silva, "All [Watson and 
Richie] said was that they will 

Richie added that the Academic 
Senate will soon be considering a 
proposal for an ethnic studies 
department here. 

Watson could not be reached 
for comment. 

Dottie Keffala, the Chancellor's 
secretary, said on Friday that the 
Chancellor had just returned from 
meetings out of town, and had 
not yet examined the protesters' 
demands. 

After visiting the Chancellor's 
office, the protesters marched to 
Revelle Plaza, where they listened 
to over 15 speakers. 

"We can't do anything about 
the past, but we can do something 
about the future," aid John 
Ramirez, president of the A.S. 
Council, which recently passed a 
resolution demanding ethnic and 
gender studies at UCSD. 

"It's important that we start 
learning about each other. Racism 
come from being naive . .. that' 
why it' important that we have 
ethnic a nd gender studies."

Undergraduate science educa-
tion at UCSD will receive $1.2 
million in grant money awarded 
May 24 by the Howard Hughes 
Medicallnstit'lle (HHMI). 

The grant will support a five-
year program designed to "stimu-
late the studehts' interest in bio-
logical sciences and to maintain 
their desire in pursuing careers in 
the biological "and health scien-
ces," according to the grant pro-
posal submitted to HHMI from 
UCSD. 

"The purpose of the program is 
to encourage students to choose 
biological sciences as ... careers, 
particularly as an academic ca-
reer," Lujeu Sham, dean of natu-
ral sciences, said. "In the 1990s, 
the nation's univer ities are going 
to be under taffed, and the How-
ard Hughes Institute recognizes 
that. " 

The program will al 0 place a 
trong empha is on attracting 

women and minorities into the 
sciences. 

"We will have a shortage of 
scientists as we approach the mil-
lineum here," said biology Pro-
fessor John Holland, who will 
direct the program. "The white 
Anglo-Saxon Protestants, the 
WASPs, are becoming a minor-
ity. We need to get scientists from 
all the groups interested in sci-
ence. " 

The UCSD award was one of 
51 grants awarded to universities 
in the United States by HHMI. 
Together, the grants totaled $61 
million. To be eligible for grants, 
universities were required to dis-
play "a commitment to under-
graduate education," according 
to Joseph G. Perpi h, ice pre i-
dent for grants and special pro-
grams at HHMI. 

"UCSD came up with a good 
propo al on how to bolster the 
undergraduate science curic-
culum, how to recruit students in 
cience, and how to retain tu-

dent who declare a science major 
as freshmen," Perpich said. 

According to Sham, the pro-
gram will have three components: 
a high school science enrichment 
program, support for undergrad-
uates during their first years at 
UCSD, and involvement of under-
graduate in research projects 
during their junior and enior 
years. 

The high school program will 
involve UCSD professors in con-
ducting seminars for high school 
students. 

"The professors at UCSD are 
specialists. They have their finger 
on the pulse of the latest informa-
tion in science .. .. We're hoping 
they11 teach at high schools and 
get students interested in science 
. . . but the first step i to get the 
program going," Holland aid. 

"A lot of people don't have a 
science background when they 
come to UCSD and that' why 
they have trouble when they get 
here," he added.

the outreach program is Lincoln

Ride at UCLA's Mardi Gras Festival 
Faulty, Daily Inspections Continue 

LOS ANGELES - Officials ordered a Mardi Gras 
ride off a field after a private ride inspector found 

'major structural cracks in a support beam Wedne -
day, May 17. 

Butler Amusements, which operates most of the 
rides at the event, quickly removed the ride "Super 
Loops" as a second operator brought in another. 

UCLA safety engineers, fire officials, and state 
inspectors, in addition to the private ride inspector, 
examine all aspects of Mardi Gras to ensure its safe 
operation - a practice in effect for several years. 

Despite the removal of a potentially unsafe ride, 
even the inspector who found the defect called the 
rides the "Cadillacs of equipment." 

"It has been safe [for the past several years], which 
is all the more reason to have a ride inspector," said 
Chris Bess, executive director of Mardi Gras. 

I n an effort to keep the cost of liability insurance 
premiums to a minimum, Mardi Gras organizers paid 
$4,000 this year for the services of professional ride 
inspector Patrick Hoffman of Phoenix . The presence 
of a ride inspector does not lower the required 
$2,000,000 liability policy, however. 

The inspector looks for signs of structura l fatigue 
or poor construction from the base of the rides to the 
smallest details above, especially the rides' blockings, 
hangars and pins which keep the rides together. 

During each day of the Mardi Gras' four-day run , 
Hoffman will inspect the rides before the park opens 
to the public and, once people arrive, make sure the 
carnival workers operate the rides safely.

Two UCLA Students Visit China in 
Support of Government Protests 
LOS ANGELES - Two UCLA students, represent-

Saturday, May 20, to join the hundreds of thousands 
of people protesting for democracy. 

Jian Ding and Tong Boning from UCLA's 500-
member Chinese Students and Scholars As ociation 
went home bringing donations and moral support to 
the student-led demonstration . 

More than 3,000 university students began a hunger 
strike May 13 on the SLOne tiles of Tian An Men 
Square, China's symbolic center of power, calling for 
political reform. They ended the fast May 20 to con-

serve strength for the struggle ahead, student leaders 
said. 

Ding, a Beijing University alumnus, said he did not 
expect the student protest to have such a tremendous 
impact. 

But he does feel it will lead to a freer China, said 
Ding, now a first-year .aduate student at UCLA's 
library school. "Once students stand up, it's impossi-
ble for them to kneel again." 

The students are fighting for the most basic human 
and civil rights, he said. "The first thing, the most 
important, is the freedom of the press, the freedom of 
speech," Ding said on campus Thursday, May 18. 

Chinese students at UCLA, USC, Caltech and 
other Southland universities donated about S8,OOO to 
aid the fasting students, said Weinan E, a UCLA stu-
dent spokesperson . More than 2,000 fasters have been 
hospitalized since the strike.

UCLA Experiences Water Main Burst . 
LOS ANGELES - Administrative facilities offi-

cials blocked off an area of UCLA after a water main 
burst early in the morning on May 18. 

At about 4 a .m., buildings in the vicinity expe 
rienced a decrease in water pressure, said Connee 
Freeman, director of facilities management. Because 
UCLA's water system is looped, however, the pressure 
was quickly restored by redirecting the water supply. 

Nicolaou is best known for his development of syn-
thetic techniques useful in the synthesis of a wide var-
iety of organic compounds. Most of his research is 
focused on the understanding and synthesis of natural 
products that have potential medical applications. 

A native of Cyprus, he earned his bachelor's degree 
in 1969 at Bedford College and his Ph.D. in 1972 at 
University College, both part of the University of 
London. From 1972 to 1976, he held research asso-
ciate positions at Columbia and Harvard universities. 
Since 1976 he has served on the faculty of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, attaining the rank of professor 
within five years of his arrival. 

Nicolaou has published more than 200 scientific 
articles and holds II patents. 

Nicolaou will bring a research group of more than 
20 people to San Diego and will have labs at both 
U.CSD and the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic. 

At Scripps Clinic, Nicolaou and other investigators 
and staff of the chemistry department will eventually 
be housed in the planned Center for Chemistry, to be 
located on a portion of a recently purchased 21-acre 
parcel on North Torrey Pines Road. The department, 
which currently has 15 chemists, plans to expand its 
faculty within the next few years. 

At UCSD, Nicolaou's labs will eventually be 
housed in the new Sciences Building adjacent to Urey 
Hall. Construction of the building will begin in July 
1990.

See WRITING, pale 7 

Over the past few years, the 
literature department has usually 
received money from the Univer-
sity to fund the writing program. 
The department usually receives, 
as it has for the 1989-90 academic 
year, $33,700 in the form of one 
Full-time Equivalent (FTE), 
which provides enough money to 
hire one full-time professor. 

There are other permanent 
professors who teach writing, but 
theirs are joint appointments 
requiring them to share their time 
with other sections of the litera-
ture department. 

The remainder of the writing 
workshops are taught by visiting 
writers, whether they be well-
known novelists or local writers. 
Visiting writers, Davidson said, 
have not yet been asked back for 
next year because the department 
has relied too heavily on soft 
funds.

One FIE can be broken up to

All writing workshops arc fund-
ed from this "soft" money which 
partly comes from salary savings 
of literature professors who 
choose to forfeit all or part of 
their salaries when they take leaves 
of absence. 

That money is returned to the 
department and disbursed to the 
various sections of the depart-
ment as needed. 

According to Davidson, the 
writing section of the literature 
department has been lucky to 
receive about 60 percent of that 
soft money, because 250 out of 
the 500 literature majors special-
ize in writing. 

In addition, most of the other 
sections of the literature depart-
ment have a number of perman-

According to Harold Ticho, 
vice chancellor of academic af-
fairs, both well-known novelists 
and local writers have been con-
sidered invaluable to the program, ' 
because the department and the 
students depend on this influx of 
different styles and strengths in 
writing to lend a variety to the 
courses offered. 

"I completely agree that there 
has to he circulation of different 
visitors because that gives this 
type of a program life," he said. 

When the literature department 
discovered the lack of funds, 
Kirkpatrick wrote to the adminis-
tation asking for emergency mo-
ney. 

According to Dean of Human-
ities Stanley Chodorow, Kirkpa-
trick made a good case and Cho-
dorow took up the matter with 
Ticho. 

Chodorow said that when 
Ticho allotted emergency funds 
for the program, he "reacted as 
early as he could" and "didn't put 
up any resistance whatsoever." 

She also called for an ethnic Richardson hailed the rally as a

Trading Insults 
President Bush emerged from his relative obscurity last 

Thursday, at least for a few moments, and announced that the 
U.S. may retaliate against unfair trading practices by Japan and 
other countries. This is a moment of opportunity for President 
Bush; if he, in fact, uses the power the U.S . has as the world's 
biggest market to open up free trade around the world, the 
legacy will be bright and lasting. 

But if he follows in the footsteps of his predecessor and combines 
free trade rhetoric with protectionist action, he deserves harsh 
criticism. The signals are mixed: at the same time Bush is attack-
ing Japan's actions, he is making no move to curb the protection-
ist policies of the U ,S. There's no question Japanese firms and 
their government engage in unfair trading practices, but the sim-
ple fact is that any protection is unfair; it does a large amount of 
cumulative harm to a diffuse group in the interests of a small, 
vocal special interest. 

It isn't hard to spot the beneficiaries. If, for example, a limit is 
placed on the import of textiles, the firms which produce textiles, 
and their employees, see direct benefits. With tariffs raising their 
competitors.' prices, or quotas reducing their supply, the firms 
can make btgger profits. 

But there is also a high cost side. When parents go to the 
store to buy clothes for their children, they will face higher prices 
and, very possibly, lower quality. While this may not substan-
tially affect the families of the CEOs of textile firms, who very 
likely just put the purchases on their credit cards and toss the 
clothes in the trunks of their BMWs, the higher prices have a much 
stronger impact on a poor family , 

Competition's effect on quality is also important. The most 
noticeable example of this is in automobile manufacturing. The 
big three firms - GM, Ford and Chrysler - were largely 
unresponsive in the early 1970s to consumer demand for more 
fuel-efficient cars . This imposed a large cost on society. But 
foreign manufacturers provided the smaller cars, and the com-
petition forced domestic firms to raise quality and be more 
responsive to consumer wants. 

The objection is raised, however, that the benefits to the 
workers in the protected industry outweigh any costs. After all, 
the argument goes, they would be unemployed otherwise. But 
this view doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Having workers waste 
their energies by producing goods which are made more effi-
ciently elsewhere does no favor to society. Moreover, the unem-
ployment is just shifted to other workers. In the textile example, 
workers in industries which use textiles as an input are going to 
find that their firms are facing higher prices, and will have to 
begin to layoff workers, More unemployment, rather than less, 
is the likely result. 

On another level, trade barriers often harm the countries 
which need our help the most. We might send millions in aid to a 
small South American country, then force its economy into 
disarray by erecting trade barriers to its products. This confusing 
policy clearly benefits neither country, and the Latin American 
debt crisis has part of its origin in U.S . trade barriers, 

So, given that free trade between two countries benefits both, 
how can we achieve it? The political obstacles are high. Many 
Japanese consumers, especially those who have come to Amer-
ica as tourists, know that their food prices are outrageous. But 
this concern does not motivate enough of a political backlash to 
push aside the tremendous political clout of the farm lobby, 

The U.S . faces similar 'o-bstacles. The political cost of moving 
toward free trade is too high to make it an acceptable alternative 
in most cases. When a textile bill was being debated in the 
Senate, a senator from Texas argued persuasively the free trade 
case. But when it came to an oil import tariff, his thinking had 
changed. This is typical of the sort of political pressure placed 
on members of Congress. 

It remains to be seen whether President Bush's charges of 
unfair trading practices are just rhetoric, which may lead to a 
costly trade war, or whether he seriously intends to force Japan 
and other countries to open their markets, Moreover, if the 
effort is not coupled with measures to open the U .S. markets, it 
is mere hypocrisy, and hypocrisy which is more harmful than 
helpful to U.S . interests. 

Economists may have wide disagreements on a lot of issues , 
but on open trade the consensus is clear: it benefits every country 
engaged in it. President Bush has a chance to act in the best 
interests of the U .S. economy, and to encourage other countries 
to act in their own best interest. Hopefully, he will seize this 
opportunity.

Editor: 
Enough already; this is getting 

irritating. Is this year's Guardian 
conducting some sort of student 
seminar on self-righteousness? 
(Perhaps "Philosophy 89: Intro-
duction to Moral Pretension.') 
Let's not even discuss the great 
"fresh person" controversy earlier 
this year; let's just talk about this 
quarter, 

Only a little while ago, when 
- horror of horrors- one of the 
frats hired a stripper, the Guardian 
solemnly, sadly shook its editorial 
head at such appallingly regres-
sive behavior; for several issues, 
the opinion pages were filled with 
neo-Victorian moralizing over 
this heinous offense against the 
dignity of womanhood. 

More recently, several students 
illegally demonstrated against the 
opening of the new Student Cen-
ter, the most clearly expresssed 
reason for the protest being that 
burning intellectual issue of our 
time: fast food chains on campus. 
When some of the students were 
briefly detained by police who 
were not always exquisitely cour-
teous, the Guardian's editorial 
harrumph at such unprofessional 
behavior could probably be heard 
as far as Kent State. One officer in 

particular, who had to chase one 
of the students around the build-
ing and then into a fountain, was 
criticized for making nasty re-
marks. To think that policemen 
should react like human beings!. ..

inappropriate occasion for moral 
outrage is played by the Guardian See MORALITY, pale 15 

Seeking Middle East Peace 
Edilor: 

The recent spurt of letters 
regarding the Arab-Israeli con-
flict brought out two significant 
letters in Thursday's Guardian 
which, even though they appeared 
to be from opposing sides of the 
issue, actually had a lot in com-
mon, 

First, in response to the letter 
by Ara Djamboulian: I applaud 
your desire to "sit down at the 
negotiating table." As a person 
with personal experience in the 
contlict, you know how difficult 
this has been to achieve so far. 

Israel has been calling for peace 
negotiations since her creation in 
1948, and in the ensuing 41 years 
only Egypt has answered her calL 
Thus, your plea for negotiations 
is hopefully symbolic of "a new 
breeze blowing" in the Middle 

East. 
Yet, your call contains unfor-

tunate declarations of what these 
talks must achieve, All parties to 
the conflict should come to the 
negotiations without any precon-
ceived notions of what these talks 
MUST achieve, Rather, every 
party should bring any and all 
ideas to the negotiations for dis-
cussion, without setting any preor-
dained outcome, 

Therefore, your comment that 
these negotiations must lead to 
the creation of ' an independent 
Palestinian state is unfounded, 
Rather, what is needed is a step-
by-step approach towards devel-
oping mutual trust in each other. 
Israel cannot feasibly be expected 
to develop a new neighbor occu-
pied by people whose recent and

By DONOVAN p, ROCHE 
Assistant Arts Editor 

Just before I transferred to UCSD as ajunior 
in spring of 1986, my brother Tim, the philo-
sopher, convinced me that I didn't want to be a 
marine biologist. This came as quite a surprise, 
especially since I had chosen UCSD because of its 
connection to Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 
But now that I look back on the incident, it's 
quite amazing how simple it all was. 

One day Tim pulled me aside and asked, 
"What is it about marine biology that interests 
you?" 

1 thought about it for a moment and said, "I 
like to learn about parameciums and jellyfish and 
dolphins and sharks ... " 

"But you could do that and still not become a 
marine biologist, you know," Tim immediately 
followed ,

Well now, that was a new approach. I had 
never thought of my major at the time as simply 
an interest of mine and not a genuine career 
option, And then the clincher came. 

Tim asked, "You don't want to spend the rest 
of your life hanging over a petri dish, do you?" 

"God no!" 1 said. " I want to be like Jacques 
Cousteau and play around in the ocean with 
dolphins and.1~uff," 

Needless to say, Tim was able to show me that 
my concept of marine biology was a bit idealized 
and that I should find another major I would be 
more suited for. 

I was definitely (and still am for that matter) 
more of a "creative" person than a "scientific" one

notch journalism department a second thought ,

The UCSD Guardian OPINION Tuesday, May 30. 1989 5 

Zionist Propaganda 34 Americans, So the myth 0/ Israel's security 
succeeded in allowing 34 of Amer-
ica's finest men to become statis-
tics. Murdered by the Israeli war 
machine. Security was the pretext 
given by successive Israeli govern-
ments for widespread massacres 
of civilian populations in Leba-
non, for expropriations of Arab 
lands, for the establishment of 
Jewish settlements in the occu-
pied territories , for deportations, 
and for arbitrary detentions of 
political prisoners. 

Softball Team Problems 
Edilor: 

While reading Jeffrey Hoffer's 
letter (Guardian, May 22) entitled 
"The Facts on Israel ," it was 
clearly obvious that he is a stu-
dent of "Israeli Mythology 101." 
This Mythology 101 is taught 
nationwide in these United States 
by Zionist Jews, through false 
propaganda in the U.S, media, 

It is taught only in this country, 
however, and not all over the 
world, thank God. Worldwide, 
the accepted facts about the 
Palestinian situation are that Arabs 
were "forcibly removed" from 
their homes and their lands in 
order to make room for the new 
Zionist Jewish occupiers, 

The most current example of 
this type of occupation is the 
present situation in the West 
Bank, The occupation in the West 
Bank reflects the true, hostile, 
identity of Israel. Israel has killed 
approximately 465 Palestinians 
within the past year there and has 
made the living suffer hell on 
earth, 

One particular victim oflsrael's 
aggression was a woman aged 86 
by the name of Nellie S. Bargh-
out. She died Feb. 4, 1988 due to 
the inhalation of toxic tear gas 
used by the Israelis. The tear gas 
was thrown in an enclosed area in 
front of a church, one Sunday 
afternoon. 

The tear gas caused a stroke to 
the victim, as it does to most 
elderly and also young children 
under five. Two children also died 
in this very same manner and one 
was only two-years-old. The rea-
son that I know such detailed 
facts about the victim is because 
she was my grandmother. 

Is this the way that Israel takes 
care of her neighbors? Is this the 
way Israel maintains "meticulous 
care of the holy places sacred to 
all religions" by throwing tear gas 
canisters and shooting bullets at 
them? The Israeli Army also took 
meticulous care of a Catholic 
church by shooting it up while 
mass was being held and sent 
praying people screaming, This 
was done in retaliation for the/act 
that an Arab priest was appointed 
as leader of the region by Pope 
John Paul II. 

These above incidents are trade-
marks of Israel's terrorist tenden-
cies and are further evidence that 
the state of Israel was created 
through the use of terrorism, The 
logic that Mr. Hoffer used that 
"the Irgun and Stern Gang issued 
warnings hours before their in-
tended attacks" doesn't justify all 
of the murders, massacres, and 
atrocities that they committed 
against the Arabs, 

That logic just does not hold 
water because by that same token 
we can say that Hitler warned the 
Jews in Germany for months to 
leave Germany before he did what 
he did . Hitler gave the Jews fair 
warning so that makes him blame-
less too, right? Mr. Hoffer, your 
logic is incredibly ludicrous. 

By that same logic it would 
make Hitler a better man than the 
leaders of Irgun because he at 
least gave months of warning 
whereas the Zionists only gave 
hours notice before their raids on 
Arab villages, Mr. Jeffrey Hoffer, 
how far can you run in an hour? 

The final fact that I would like 
to clear up is regarding the inci-
dent with the U.S ,S. Liberty, 
There is clearly documented evi-
dence that the attack against the 
Liberty was definitely not an 
accident, Obviously after six hours 
of surveillance, the I raelis knew 
that it was an American ship, 

" In the month following the 
Liberty attack, the Central Intel-
ligence Agency (C IA) received a 

number of reports in support of 
the view that it [the attack] was 
deliberate." (This sentence was on 
page 213 of the book Assault on 
the Liberty by James M. Ennes, 
Jr. I wanted to cite the page 
number so that Jeffrey Hoffer 
knows that I don't make up my 
facts,) 

The U,S. intelligence ship was 
taken out of the water because the 
Israelis knew that the Liberty was 
a well-equipped "spy ship" and 
that the Liberty was about to dis-
cover that Israel's tactics in the 
area were far from "self defense" 
purposes, It was because the lib-
erty had access to vital informa-
tion that the Israelis knowingly 
and willingly attacked it, killing 

It is sheer mythology to believe 
that Israel is a nation fighting for 
its survival. M r. Hoffer, I hope 
you stop studying Israeli Myth-
ology and start learning about the 
F ACTS ON ISRA EL.

After numerous failed attempts 
to remedy the situation with the 
coaches, the intercollegiate de-
partment, the Dean of Student 
Affairs and the Chancellor during 
the last 10 months, the problems 
have unfortunately worsened. The 
final straw which has resulted in 
this letter was the coaches' con-

harrassment of a player.

J-Board Ruling Hurts Elections 

The problem began when two 
women were hired as co-coaches 
last January, and after showing 
up three hours late for their first 
day, had the gall to demand our 
immediate respect. Instead of 
earning their title, they insisted on 
us calling them "coach" on and 
off the field. 

"Favoritism is ram-
pant, especially for 
those who are influ-
enced by [the coaches1 
sexual preference, " Editor: 

As election manager this year, 
I received a lot of input on how to 
make elections better. Most of 
this input was regarding slates, 
candidates finding loopholes in 
the bylaws and how we, as an 
Election Committee, could pre-
vent that from happening in the 
future. With all that has occurred 
around the office of vice pres-
ident external and the poor 
judgment and ruling of the Judi-
cial Board, I have output to give. 

The Judicial Board did not 
take into consideration the EJec-
tion Committee's ruling on this 
case. It will be very difficult to 
attempt to make elections more 
efficient with the precedent the 
Judicial Board has just set. They 

not only acknowledged that a 
candidate committed violations 
to the bylaws, they rewarded the 
candidate by allowing the viola-
tions (of which they found only 
one, the election committee found 
more than five) to go unpunished. 

It will be very difficult to try to 
revise the election bylaws without 
loopholes, and in the end it will 
not even matter because what I 
see from the Judicial Board's rul-
ing is that you can just go ahead 
and violate the bylaws, and if you 
are lucky enough to sway enough 
votes in your favor to win, maybe 
the Judicial Board might even 
reward you by giving you the 
office.

In addition, they often brought 
their personal relationship prob-
lems with them to practices and 
games. They established a pattern 
of arriving late, yet they created 
enough policies for us to fill a 
book. 

As coaches they are poor role 
models. They disobey laws: drink-
ing and driving the team in uni-
versity vehicles, excessive speed-
ing and breaking into their un-
rented condo are just a few, 

Favoritism is rampant, esPe-
cially for those who are influ-
enced by their sexual preference. 
At the same time, sexual prefer-
ence was made an issue not only 
by segregating the team with van 
and room assignments, but also 
spending immense amounts of 

assault was directed towards a 
heterosexual team captain, Once 
again, the exaggerated sexual dif-
ference conflict on the team was 
made an issue. We would like to 
point out here that we are in no 
way denouncing homosexuality, 
only reacting to this issue the 
coaches have created, 

We do not expect this letter to 
accomplish miracles; we are 
simply making the public aware 
of the misuse of authority in the 
UCSD Intercollegiate Softball 
Program. When you hurt one of 
the clique, you hurt us all.

OPINION 

Spineless J-Board Ruling 
Editor: 

I havejust been informed of the 
spineless decision that the A.S. 
Judicial Board made regarding 
the vice president external 
affairs case, i.e. Peters vs. Micagz 
It's nice to hear that rules were 
meant to be broken and laws not 
enforced. 

during the run-off election, in 
which she was speaking through a 
public address system and hold-
ing a "Vote Mishka" sign (which 
the Guardian exposed to all), and 
to still find her innocent on count 
three listed above, how can I not 
be upset with the Judicial Board's 
decision. Let me say, this letter is 

not intended to demean Mishka, 
rather to expose the incompetence 
of the ASUCSD JUdicial Board. 

Question: does this decision 
mean students can violate U ni-
versity regulations and expect no 
repercussions for their actions? 
And what purpose does the A.S . 
Judicial Board serve if it does not 
act fairly or for the benefit of the 
students? 

Matt Kaplan 
Finding Mishka innocent on 

three counts of blatant violations, 
i.e. exceeding spending limits for 
her runoff campaign, not report-
ing all campaign materials, and 
using ASUCSD facilities, servi-
ces, or equipment for campaign-
ing is one thing. However, to find 
her guilty of soliciting door-to-
door in Muir apartments and to 
have the gall to say that that did 
not sway even THREE votes, I 
think the Judicial Board must be 
very naive or very biased against 
Craig Peters . 

A Defense Of T As 

In a school where the admini-
stration has such an iron-grip over 
the students, the only way we the 
students are going to gain strength 
is to administer power within 
ourselves. This means enforcing 
penalties against individuals who 
break the rules. This also means 
that the Judicial Board must hear 
the cases impartially, and with the 
utmost desire for justice. 

I'm sorry if I sound biased, but 
aft e r see ing Mishka at the 
Women 's Resource Center rally 

EcUtor: 
I am wntmg in response to 

Renee Lewis' letter (Guardian. 
May 22) in order to clarify the 
selection and responsibilities of 
TAs. 

In the chemistry department, 
we graduate students are required 
to T A a specific number of 
courses during our years here. We 
are not chosen, we are assigned. 

This is something we must do 
in addition to our primary respon-
sibility, our own dissertation re-
search, and to our own classes, if we 
are taking any. There are many of 
us who do care about the success 
of our students, but we frequently 
cannot do more to help them due 
to our other obligations. 

We did not come to UCSD to 
teach undergraduates - we came 
here to continue our own studies, 
and that must remain as our 
primary concern. That is why we 

are neither rewarded for being 
good T A 's nor punished for being 
bad. 

It is also extremely frustrating 
to be assigned to a class of under-
graduates who do not want to 
learn and make no effort. In 
many cases, if you would partici-
pate in your learning and not 
expect to be spoon-fed, I think 
that you would find your lA's to 
be more enthusiastic and better 
teachers.

Fortunately, the recent spurt of 
letters comes precisely at the time 
that Israel's prime minister, Yitz-
chak Shamir, has submitted a 
plan for free elections in the Gaza 
district and the West Bank, so the 
residents can choose their repre-
sentatives to these negotiations. I 
call on you, Mr. Djamboulian, to 
lobby in favor of this election 
plan, so that all parties to the con-
flict can materialize this first step 
towards the termination of "name 
calling" and replacing that with 
all parties "sitting down at the 
negotiating table." 

The second letter in Thursday's 
Guardum implied a similarity in 
the purposes of AI PAC and the 
PLO. The PLO is an organization 
whose national charter states that 
its existence is for the termination 
of the state of Israel. 

AlPAC, on the other hand, is the 
pro-Israel lobby group in the Uni-
ted States whose purpose is to 
maintain the strong American-
Israeli friendship and to support 
the state ofIsrael. AIPAC does not 
represent any intention even sim-
ilar to the PLO's charter cited 
above. 

The similarity between the two 
letters arises when the author of 
the second, Mordecai Potash, fires 
off the suggestion that a Palesti-
nian state should be immediately 
created despite the major threat it 
would cause to Israel. It should be 
created, M r. Potash contends, 
because "life's not perfect." 

This is a very careless approach 
to take in resolving the conflict in 
the unstable Middle East; an area 
where countries who have signed 
mutual cooperation agreements 
have turned on each other and 
replaced the agreements with 
military confrontation - as seen 
between Iran and Iraq, and Syria 
and Egypt. 

This highlights the reason that 
the step-by-step approach to de-
veloping mutual trust is so impor-
tant, and now the opportunity 
exists. Prime Minister Shamir's 
free election plan should be the 
rallying cry from both sides ofthe 
conflict in order to achieve step 
number one.

WRITING 
Continued from pace 3 
fiction courses added as well as 
two upper-division writing cour-
ses and a poetry course. 

In addition, students wishing 
to write nht quarter can enroll in 
writing courses offered by the 
drama and visual arts depart-
ments and petition the Iiterature/ 
writing department for credit, 
Davidson said. 

According to sources in the 
department, the additional money 
will help to bring the writing pro-
gram close to full force in the fall. 

Student initiative c~n also play 
a part in the matter. 

Departmental sources have said 
that it is important that all stu-
dents who plan to major in litera-
ture / writing declare that major. 
Such a declaration, these sources 
believe, will aid students in regis-
tering for departmental courses 
and will help administrators deter-
mine departmental needs. 

Davidson stressed that things 
are still changing, and said he is 
eager for all students to have 
access to writing courses.

UCSD protesters organized a rally and march against racism last 
Thursday. 

RALL Y: Students Speak 
Continued from pale 3

Third College senior Sergio

what goes on in ethnic studies. 
We must be in control of the 
organizations that teach us and 
our children."

tutorial sessions, seminars, and

of what will be the world's largest 
telescope was presented to the UC 
Board of Regents at a an Fran-

The telescope, funded and built 

by UC and the California Techni-

Active Students for Kids 

Volunteers Tutor Elementary Schoolers 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
Sialf Wriler 

"T oteachistoleamtwice." 
said 19th century author 
Jo ephJoubert . While 

learning twice might ound un-
productive and dull to mo t , 
members of Active Students for 
Kids (A K) find this one of the 
most rewardmg aspect of their 

work. 
"For students to give back to 

students" i the ideal of the ASK 
program, which was developed 
last year with the goal offostering 
a stimulating, encouraging, and 
motivating environment for 
young school children who may 
not get the per onal attention 
they deserve. Composed of over 
90 UCSD students, most from 
Warren College, member of the 

Warren student Audrey Cruz engages in one-on-one tutoring with a 
Bay Park Elementary School boy. 

AS K program volunteer two 
hours per week to tutor children 
from kindergarten through the 
fifth grade. 

The program began with a 
brainstorm at a Warren Apart-
ment Government meeting in the 
fall of 1987. According to coordi-
nator and "Founding Mother" 
Caroline Allam, ASK was origi-
nally going to be some type of 
community service program. How-
ever, overwhelming support for 
an outreach program serving kids 
in San Diego City Schools caused 
AS K to develop into one of 
UCSD's most active programs. 

The program aims to provide 
an opportunity for UCSD stu-
dents to take an active role in 
society through community ser-
vice and to respond to the increas-
ing effects of poverty, illiteracy, 
and cultural diversity on the 
drop-out rate in San Diego. 

Another goal of ASK is to 
serve as a role model to other 
community groups, and perhaps 
to the other colleges on campus, 
since the demand for tutors is 
increasing. according to ASK. 

ASK's three main programs 
are one-on-one tutoring, active 
assistance in the classroom, and 
afterschool enrichment in areas 
such as physical education, sports, 
fine arts, and computer work. 
Through this assistance to ele-

Career Center Surveys Graduates 
By WILEEN WONG 
Contributing Writer 

Inevitably, it happens to a\l of 
us. While cramming for the dread-
ed exam, thoughts drift from the 
first law of thermodynamics to 
The Future. What happens when 
the four (or more) years are over? 
Are jobs available? What are the 
salaries of those jobs? 

Every year, the Career Services 
Center does a survey which ans-
wers some of those questions. The 
survey includes information on 
jobs, earnings, and students pur-
suing graduate study. 

Last year's survey was sent to 
1,218 June 1988 graduates, 51 
percent of whom responded to 
the survey. According to the pub-
lished results , the graduates 
proved that it was "another strong 
year. " 

The survey analyzes the gradu-
ates through a series of charts. 
One is titled "What Became of 
Them," which shows what per-
centage of the students are work-
ing part-time (6 percent), seeking 
work (4 percent), working full 
time (60 percent), working on 
master's / doctoral study (26 per-
cent), or doing other studies (4 
percent). 

Another chart shows the per-
centage of students by major 
involved in each of the five activi-
ties used in the first chart. The 
results indicate that graduates who 
majored in applied mechanics/ 
mechanical engineering, electrical 
engineermg, communication, and 
economics have had the most 
success in obtaining full-time jobs. 
On the other hand, only 20 per-
cent of the anthropology majors 
are working full time; the major-
ity, 60 percent, are continuing 
their studies. 

As indicated in a third chart, 70 

percent of the graduates are cur-
rently in the workforce. The aver-
age salary for those working full 
time is $22,000. 

Graduates working in technical 
fields, 29 percent of the 70 percent 
in the workforce, reported an 
average salary of$27, 700, making 
them the only group to earn sig-
nificantly more than the average. 
The lowest salaries were reported 
by the 9 percent working in non-
professional fields. Their annual 
salaries, $16,000, are lower than 
the $17,800 those working in the 
area of human services (II per-
cent) earned. 

The survey "helps 
figure out how to best 
serve the students. It's 
a reality to check to 
look at the experien-
ces of the predeces-
sors. " 

- Neil Murray 

The fourth chart focuses on the 
30 percent who chose to continue 
their studies. The majority, 18 
percent, are pursuing master's / doc-
toral study in the humanities/ so-
cial sciences. 

The survey has been conducted 
annually since 1982. It was started 
because the Office of Student 
Research and I nformation "needs 
to understand what becomes of 
our graduates,"said Neil Murray, 
director of the Career Services 
Center. 

The survey also "helps figure 
out how to best serve the stu-
dents. It's a reality check to look 

at the experiences of the predeces-
sors," Murray added. 

The results of the survey are 
listed in greater detail in the Career 
Survey Handbook, located in the 
reference area on the first floor of 
the career center. The notebook 
is divided into arts, biology, com-
munications, economics, en-
gineering, humanities, interdisci-
plinary studies, math, science, and 
social sciences categories. 

The categories are divided fur-
ther into specific job titles, the 
name of the company or organi-
zation that hired the particular 
graduates, the cities they work in, 
and their salaries. There are sur-
veys on hand from 1983 to 1988. 

According to Murray, the Ca-
reer Survey Handbook can be used 
in several different ways . It can 
help students "generate career 
ideas of their own, [and] see what 
looks appealing" as well as give 
an "idea of potential employers," 
Murray explained. 

There also is a notebook of 
professional school programs 
which is arranged in much the 
same way as the Career Survey 
Handbook. This handbook can 
be found in the reference area 
located on the second floor. 
Categories included in the hand-
book are the course of study, 
what schools the grad uates attend, 
what degrees are being sought, 
and the G P As the students had as 
u ndergrad ua tes . 

According to the survey, "eigh-
ty-eight percent of the graduates 
rate their education [at UCSD] as 
excellent or very satisfactory . Skill 
at coping with pressure and prob-
lem solving ability are the areas of 
preparation with the highest rat-
ing. All in all, Murray feels that 
the survey is well-received by stu-
dents. So far, said Murray, it has 
gotten "positive comments from 
the students, and [the handbooks] 
are used all the time." 

Kavika Knight is one of the few ASK tutors who is not a Warren 
student. 

mentary schoolers, ASK hopes to . 
foster in the students an aware-
ness of the challenges and oppor-
tunities presented in the public 
education system. 

A surprising number of elemen-
tary school children in San Diego 
could be called 'disadvantaged,' 
whether it is due to poverty, 
speaking English as a second lan-
guage, being a "latch key" kid, 
and / or having parents in the mil-
itary, which can increase the pos-
sibility of relocation. 

Some members of ASK see 
overcrowded classrooms as an 
additional disadvantage. "I re-
member the student-to-teacher 
ratio was very poor when I was in 
elementary school," said ASK 
member Lisa Porter. "There was 
never anyone else around to help." 

Like other ASK members, Por-
ter feels that no one person can do 
it all or change the world, but if 
everyone could do some sort of 
philanthropic activity, then per-
haps a domino effect would pre-
vail. "A lot of people wish they 
could come more than just one

hour a week," Allam said. "That's 
the great thing about ASK, it's 
just not a big time commitment." 

Members feel that this is one 
thing that can really fit well into 
their busy college schedules, be-
cause the time commitment is so 
little. According to Porter, "a lot 
of people shy away from social 
work because sometimes it can be 
a real drain, but this really isn't." 

Students have a variety of rea-
sons for dOing the tutoring, from 
battling the statistics to gaining 
teaching experience to simply 
working with the kids. This last 
reason is the most prevalent 
reported in survey's the tutors 
took, who report that they "like 
being with kids," or "missed being 
with kids." 

The tutors receive no salary; 
intangible personal rewards re-
place monetary compensation. 
"It's something 1 wantto do," said 
fresh person and ASK member 
Kim Pogorelsky. "The kids are 
really cute, and the one I tutor 
gives me a hug when I leave. " 

"I enjoy the work," Porter said.

Though it may be difficult to 
measure the benefits of a tutor in 
terms of a student's grades, Allam 
feels that a change in the student's 
attitude is easily detected . Further, 
the young students bCnefit from 
the role model function that the 
older students serve. 

Currently, ASK. members tutor 
students from Bay Park Elemen-
tary in Mission Bay and Bayview 
Terrace in Pacific Beach. The 
group's long-term goal is to in-
volve Dther San Diego college 
students so that, ideally, each col-
lege could tutor students in its 
area. 

ASK is autonomous but spon-
sored by the Volunteer Connec-
tion. Interested students can call

TA Smoking 
Annoying 
Eclltor: 

I was sitting in theater class 
doing "relaxing exercises." The 
competent T A guided me through 
the exercises. 

As I was relaxing, I sensed a 
lingering smell in the air. My eyes 
began to dry and I became dis-
tracted from my relaxation . I 
sniffed and a moment later real-
ized that it was cigarette smoke. 

Most of us complained, but it 
was no use. The T A kept on 
smoking and soon some of the 
students joined in. Should teach-
ingassistants encourage smoking? 

I. think not. 
There is a vast amount of open 

air outside of class, so smoking 
should be prohibited in a small 
stuffy room. I, as a mere student, 
cannot vigorously complain, be-
cause my grade will be affected . 
This is an anonymous letter from 
a sufferer of second-hand smoke.

Morality 
Continued from pale 4 
you believe it? - the overworked, 
underpaid Ralphs employees of 
the graveyard shift for some rea-
son get very angry at taking all 
this verbal abuse from a snotty, 

OPINION 
boorish CQllege kid, and - shock 
of the century - they punch him

So, did the Guardian run this 
story on the inside page it de-
served, under the one-column 
heading "Drunken Foul-Mouthed 
Sophomores Learn that Actions 
Have Consequences?" Nope: in-
stead a five-column front page 
story loaded with quotes criticiz-
ing the evil Ralphs employees, 
and including a photograph of 
the poor, battered instigator of 
the entire incident, David Mad-
dow, under a headline beginning 
"UCSD Students Assaulted .... .. 

Well, 1 sure am outraged. And 
I'm sure the judge will be, too, 
when Maddow testifies in his con-
templated lawsuit that he was 

"too intoxicated at the time of the 
incident to recall" the obscene 
remarks about the store manag-
er's wife he yelled out. 

Granted that college students 
have never been noted for a sym-
pathetic understanding of human 
nature, and that being sheltered 
here in the ivory tower has a lot to 
do with that. Granted also that 
"Bloom County" and the an-
nouncements are the only good 
reasons to pick up the Guardian 
in the first place. Even so, the 
priggishness of this year's Guar-
dian staff, as of so many of this 
generation of college students, is 
too relentless and unfair to ignore.

your next encyclical, you might

OPINION 

Dog 
Continued from page 4 

Once I got to San Diego it 
became obvious that a grant and 
parental contributions weren't 
going to cover it. So, having sales 
experience behind me, I sought 
the assistance of May Company 
and their men':; clothing depart-
ment. 

While thi job certai nly served 
its purpose - keeping a roof over 
my head and food in my belly - it 
couldn't have gotten too much 
farther from a career-related oc-
cupation. Makes sense, huh? Well , 
it took me about a year and a half 
to see how ludicrous this was. 

Last September I saw gradua-
tion less than a year away and 
started to wonder what the hell I 
was still doing in clothing sales. 
" Is this what I want to be doing 
for the rest of my life?" I asked 
myself. The answer was plain and 
simple - "No!" So I quit my job 
and decided it was time for me to 
start acting like a writer outside of 
the classroom if that's what I was 
going to be. 

Believe it or not , the first door-
step I found myself on was that of 
the Guardian. I told them I'd like 

to write for the entertainment sec-
. tion and cover movies, a lbums 
and concerts (other big interests 
of mine). They warned me about 
the pay (they're dreadfully honest 
around here) , but I told them that 
it didn't matter because I just 
wanted the experience. 

"Sometimes you have to do 
stuff like this to get ahead ," I 
assured myself. "Every once in 
awhile you may be faced with 
having to take one step back to 
take two steps forward ." It's a bit 
of a shot to your ego, but I've 
found it to be t rue. 

Once hired at the Guardian, I 
felt that a "behind-the-scenes" 
look at writing for a living in the 
real world would be helpful, so I 
got involved with AlP (Academic 
Intern Program). 

After much deliberation , I 
chose to work as an editorial 
assistant for San Diego Metro-
politan Magazine. Those at AlP 
reminded me that this internship 
would be for credit and not pay. I 
told them what I told the Guar-
dian. 

Things were going quite well 
until I realized that I wasn't mak-
ing any money. And then, "the 
people upstairs" thoughtfully re-
moved my financial aid. Yes, it 

was certainly time to go to the 
Career Services Center and find 
part-time employment - that 
paid! 

Among many others, I disco-
vered that May Company was 
accepting applications . " Bu t 
where are the writing jobs that 
pay?" I wondered . "They must be 
here somewhere." 

About a week later I noticed 
that La Jolla High School needed 
a writers' assistant. All they had 
to do was hear about my exten-
sive writing background (as fresh 
as it was) and that was that. 

I'm quite surprised by the reac-
tions of people who hear how I 
have dedicated myself to becom-
ing a professional writer. T rue, it 
can be frustrating at times, but 
then again, I am at the envy of all 
those who never pursued what 
they wanted most to do. 

We often hear actors and 
actresses claim how much they 
love their jobs and that getting 
paid for what theydo isjust "icing 
on the cake." Writing is that for 
me. 

As the immortal Gustave 
Flaubert once said, "Writing is a 
dog's life, but the only life worth 
living. " 

Cloud of Racism [ have noticed many discriminatory actions from white students toward Afro-Americans. I 
see the looks, I hear the whispering and I notice 
the mockery. I am not saying that all white stu-
dents do these things, but it happens. 

Editor: 
Race should not be an issue in corporate 

American, in social circles, or in the educational 
system. But let's face the fact, race is the primary 
factor when many choices are made. 

I am not an expert on race relations nor am I a 
psychologist. I am an Afro-American and I have 
to deal with a lot of preconceived notions about 
my character. I am tired of feeling as if whites 
expect me to act , speak, or live in a certain 
manner because I am an Afro-American. If one 
does not meet those expectations, they are told 
about their "uniqueness. " Well, let me say that all 
Afro-Americans don't talk, act , or live in the 
same manner. 

Afro-Americans struggle and fight to reach the 
upper crust of white America. Many times doors 
are slammed in our faces because many people 
don't want to deal with a colored face . It is sad 
that once an Afro-American does attain a respec-
table position in society, many seek to discredit or 
destroy them. 

I know that I attend UCSD to gain knowledge 
and seek better opportunities. I hope that as the 
next generation, we don't allow ignorance to 
cloud reason, and we don't allow stereotypes to 
apply to individuals.

It took Galileo 16 years to master the universe. 
You have one night. 

It seems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few 
short hours to learn your sun spots from your satellites before the 
dreaded astronomy exam. 

On the other hand, Vivarin gives you the definite advantage. It helps 
keep you awake and mentally alert for hours. SafeJy and conveniently. So 
even when the subject matter's dull, your mind will stay razor sharp. 

If Galileo had used Vivarin, maybe he could have mastered the solar 
system faster, too.

Track 
Continued from pace 20 

Kouremetis also achieved All-
American status in the 100 meters, 
where she finished seventh with a 
12.90 clocking. Sheila Trice of 
Christopher Newport won the 
event with a 12.46 finish. 

Marc Lawler and Michelle 
Conlay were the only two Tritons 
who did not become AlI-Amer-
icans at Nationals last week. 

Lawler qualified for the finals in 
the pole vault, but his vault of 15 
feet I 1/ 4 inches put him in ninth 
place. Alex Grelland of S1. Law-
erence vaulted 16 feet 1 inch to 
win the event. Conlay finished 
13th in the 10,000 meters at 38:42. 
Anna Pineas of Carleton ran a 
35:10 to win the race. 

In the men's team competition, 
host North Central captured the 
title with 66, while Lincoln of llli-
nois finished second at 58. The 
Triton men finished with five 
points. 

SPORTS 

Golf 
Continued from pale 20 
the last 15 years (including six in a 
row) - took the team title with 
their four-round total of 1,202. 
Next year, however, the Stanis-
laus golf team is not expected to 
compete on the Division III level. 

Methodist College of North 
Carolina gave Stanislaus a fight 
as it finished only eight strokes 
behind in second place at 1,210. 
Eleven strokes separated the 16th 
place Tritons with the eighth place 
team. 

NCAA 
Continued from pace 2. 
request, for minor league baseball 
has existed for years. Why should 
high school baseball players have 
the option of attending college or 
signing with a professional ball-
club, while high school basketball 
and football players are pressured 
to attend college? 

Granted, basketball and foot-
ball players don't have to attend 
college, but if not, where else are 
they going to gain fame and noto-
riety? How many NBA superstars 
made a name for themselves in 
the Continental Basketball Asso-
ciation before making the switch? 

Familiarize yourself with these 
names for a second: Michigan, 
Duke, Georgetown, IlJinois. What 
comes to mind? Excellent aca-
demic institutions? Not a chance. 
College basketball powerhouses? 
Of course. And now for the big 
question. The envelope, please. 

How many players on these 
teams were actually accepted to 
these colleges based on their aca-

demic merits? 
Tough, tough question. 
There's no doubt that college 

basketball and football are busi-
nesses rather than sports. The 
players are merely generating 
money for their institutions. 

A week and a half ago, the col-
lege basketball world was stunned 
when the NCAA placed the Uni-
versity of Kentucky's basketball 
program on probation for three 
years. Why? Well, it was disco-
vered that a recruiter sent 51,000 
in cash to Chris Mills' father 
Claud to try and lure his son to 
Kentucky. But perhaps more' 
importantly, forward Eric Manuel 
was found to have cheated on his 
college entrance exam. 

Did Jose Canseco have to cheat 
on his college entrance exam? Did 
Dwight Gooden have to cheat on 
his college entrance exam? Did 
Rickey Henderson have to cheat 
on his college entrance exam? No. 
Maybe they did - but who would 
care? These superstars of major 
league baseball did not have to 
attend college. They jumped 
straight from high school to the 
bigs. Gooden was pitching in Shea 
Stadium at the age of 19. He 
deserved to. That's the way it 
should be. 

The recent implementation of 
Proposition 42 in the sports world 
- requiring high school students 
to achieve a combined SAT score 
of 700 a nd a Grade Point Average 
of 2.0 in order to receive a scho-
larship - should help to alter 
some of the hypocrisy in these big 
time college sports. But there is an 
obvious problem. 

Making high school athletes 
achieve any standard is going to 
keep some of the best players 

The UCSD Guardian 

from making it to the big time 
each year. The proposition is also 
discriminatory against athletes 
from low socio-economic back-
grounds who have not had the 
same schooling as those from 
higher backgrounds. High school 
baseball players, however, can get 
a combined score of 120 on the 
SAT and make millions two years 
later. 

Another bold move to change 
the image of college sports was 
recently introduced by University 
of Iowa President Hunter Raw-
lings, who intends to ban athletic 
participation of incoming first-
year students so as to achieve a 
balance between academics and 
athletics. Though some support 
Rawlings'efforts, he has met with 
all sorts of opposition. Hayden 
Fry, Iowa's football coach, threa-
tened to resign, and Terry E. 
Branstead, Iowa's governor, felt 
that Rawlings was attempting to 
institute a policy which could put 
Iowa's athletic program at a 
competitive disadvantage with 
other schools. 

In order for Rawlings' policy to 
work, it would have to be accepted 
by all colleges and universities. 
But even then, problems would 
arise. One year of academics in a 
lifetime of athletics is not going to 
turn somebody around. In fact , it 
could very well turn athletes 
farther away from academics. 

I applaud Rawlings'efforts and 
the intentions of Proposition 42, 
but nothing much is going to 
change until high school basket-
ball and football players are given 
another outlet to achieve fame 
and fortune - without lectures 
and midterms hanging over their 
heads.

A Push For 
Minor Leagues 
in Football 
and Basketball 

Quigley Wins Shot and Discus 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

Let' not kid oursel es 
here: there are very few ath-
lete in Divi ion I college 
football and men' basketball 
who actually enjoy college. 
And wh hould they? 

These guys have been thriv-
ing in the athletic spotlight all 
their live , and playing for a 
Div! ion I school they have 
loft goal - hopes for the 
pro or the majors - and 
gear their college years to-
ward tho e goals. Academ-
ics are not very important to 
most of the e athletes, and 
they shouldn't be. Recruit 
hould be given the choice 

out of high school whether to 
attend college or turn pro 
instead of being forced to 
head to the big university. 

Academics were certainly 
not very important to Jay 
Edwards, a guard on India-
na's ba ketball team. After 
two years at the university, 
Edwards a:mounced this year 
that he had gotten aU that he 
could out of college, and that 
he was going to turn pro. 
Maybe college wasn't for 
Edwards. Big deal. College 
isn't for a lot of students. 

My que tion: Why haven't 
the professional teams set up 
minor leagues for basketball 
and football? Why don't they? 
This is a perfectly reasonable

No big urpri es. Nothing star-
tling or out of the ordinary. It was 
merely bu ines a usual for Triton 
sophomore Shannon Quigley at 
the NCAA Division III Track 
and Field Nationals at orth Cen-
tral College in Naperville, Illinois 
la t weekend. 

Quigley, who ha been putting 
up big numbers all year in both 
the hot put and di cus events 
threw 45 feet 2 1/ 4 inches - a

NBA Eastern Conference Finals

PISTONS

Underdog

PHIL'S AN AL YSIS ... This is it, folks. It 's down 
to the wire. Yes, the big, huge question remains ... 
who will the Lakers get to beat in the Finals, the 
Pi tons or the Bulls? I'm not positive, but I think the 
Pistons, despite currently trailing 2-1 in the series, .will 
earn the opportunity to lose for the second stralght 
year to the Lakers. The Pistons are just a bit too to~gh 
for the Bulls. Why? Well , if you take away Isiah 
Thomas or Bill Laimbeer from the Pistons, they are 
still one of the toughest teams in the league. But if you 
take away Michael Jordan from the Bulls, they will be 
fighting it out with the Miami Heat. It would be nice 
to see Chicago make it for a change, but when you're 
about to face the best team in basketball history in the 
Finals, PHIL just has to say ... 

IT DOESN'T MATTER 
"OffICial bne (rom the Gollkn A,d .... " lnpbndac. NV 

and final throw to win the shot on 
Friday, and then returned on Sat-
urday to collect her second title 
when she recorded 146 feet 8 
inches in the discu . 

Quigley came into the National 
Meet with the nation' be t mark 
in the discu and the nation' 
econd best mark in the hot. In 

the hot, Quigley edged Mary 
Busscher of Hope College, whose 
top mark wa 44 feet 5 inches. 
Amber Lausted of Wisconsin-
O'Claire finished econd in the 
discu at 144 feet II inches. Quig-
ley became the first woman in 
UC D history to winan individual 
national title in track and field, 
and wa the only women's compet-
itor at Nationals to win an indi-
vidual title in more than one 
event. 

What was a urprise, however, 
came when Rachel Beerman, who 
just barely qualified for the final 
in the discus (her 12th place quali-
fying throw was at the cutoffline), 
threw a personal record of 139 
feet 7 inches to finish in fifth 
place. 

Quigley's and Beerman' feats 
helped the Triton women's team 
achieve 31 points and put them in 
a fourth place tie with Cortland 
State at tournament's end. Chris-
topher Newport won the women's 
team title with 58 points, and 
Wisconsin-Oshkosh was second 
at 51. Occidental was third with 
32. 

"We ended up with more points 
from the women's team than we 
ever expected," UCSD Head 
Coach Mark Stanforth said . " ... 
We have a really good group of 
coaches. [As !stant Coach] Tony 
Salerno has done a great job with 
the throwers ... 

Quigley and Beerman, however, 
were not the only Tritons who 
sparkled at Nationals . In fact, 
four of the six athletes who made 
the trip attained All-American 
status as UCSD collected two 
fourth place finishes and a fifth 
place finish. The top eight com-
petitors in each event became 
All-Americans. 

Though she ran a faster time 
(24.73) in the qualifying heats, 
Andrea Kouremetis still finished 

Peter Messrobian/ Guardian 
.. . and the shotput with a 4S'2W' heave at the Division III Nationals. 

with the nation's fourth best time 
when she ran a 25.73 in the 200-
meter finals on Friday. Denise

Tritons Finish 16th at National Tournament 

Golf Falters on Final Day 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

There are tough days , and then 
there are really tough days, The 
UCSD golf team suffered one of 
those really tough days on the 
most important day of the season 
- Friday in the final round of the 
Division III National Tourna-
ment at the Lake Panorama Golf 
Club in Panora, Iowa. 

The Tritons, who were in eighth 
place heading into the final round, 
cored a 343 on Friday - in 

heavy winds - to give them a 
total of 1,272 and 16th place out 
of 20 teams. Cal State Stanislaus 
won it with a score of 1,202. 

Perhap the toughe t day of all 
was experienced by Triton Devin 
Thomas, who shot a 93 - includ-

ing a IS on the II th hole - after 
holding second place in the indi-
vidual tournament before Friday's 
action. 

Thomas shot a 70 on Thursday 
during the four-day event, which 
was the lowest individual round 
of the tournament up until then. 
On Friday, however, John Mc-
Cullough of Methodist College 
tied Thomas' core and went on 
to win the individual title with a 
295. Mark Hutchinson of Stanis-
laus finished second at 297, just 
two strokes off the lead. Hutchin-
son held the top score among 
individuals after each day except 
Friday. 

Gary Bong and Thomas tied 
for the Triton team lead with 314. 
Bong's four-day cores were 77, 
78,84 and 85, while Thoma ' were 
73, 78 70 and 93. Thomas, only a 

sophomore, would have won the 
tournament had he shot a 74 on 
the final day. Neither Bong nor 
Thomas finished among leaders. 

Other individual Triton scores 
included Bob Knee with 327, Ed 
Tischler with 330, and Fritz Reber 
with 334. 

"The whole day was fraught 
with disasters," Wydra said about 
his team's fate on Friday. "But on 
the third day we played unbeliev-
ably well." 

On the third day, which was 
Thursday, the Tritons cored a 
306 which jumped them to eighth 
place. After Wednesday's action, 
UCSD had fallen to 11th place 
after being in sixth place after the 
first day.

lau which ha won 12 titles in
