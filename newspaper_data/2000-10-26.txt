Bilbray and Davis Debate Over Phone

Sound Found to Be Linked with Sight 
UCSD researchers discover closer relation between the 
two senses than was previously thought 
By JAIIIII LD 
Contributirw News Writer 

Researchers at the UCSD School of 
Medicine have completed a study supporting 
the theory that drawing attention to a sound 
enhances the ability to see objects that appear 
at the same location. 

John McDonald, post-doctoral researcher, 
collaborated with UCSD professor of neuro-
sciences Steven HillyaJd and UCSD assistant 
project scientist Wolfgang A. Teder-Salejarvi. 
Together they examined two senses rather 
than just one, as previous studies had done, to 
discover that the senSe of sound influences 
that of sight. 

"We used new techniques in relating cross 
modal interactions with attention process-
ing: McDonald said. "We're basically trying 
to figure out how the brain works and how 
sensory information in one modality affects 
information of other modalities." 

The study consisted of two separate 
experiments using 33 volunteers who were 
asked to indicate whether a dim light in their 
peripheral vision appeared following a sound. 
The light and sound either appe~ on the 
same side or on opposite sides. • 

"These studies show a stronger linkage 
between sight and hearing than previously

Political event continued 
with Bilbray unable to 
physically attend 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Council co-sponsored a debate 
Wednesday night between Democratic congres-
sional candidate Susan Davis and incumbant 
Republican congressman Brian Bilbray in the 
Price Center Ballroom as each hoped to win the 
votes of UCSD students in the Nov. 7 congres-
sional election. 

About 225 individuals attended the event 
even though Bilbray had to participate in the 
debate over the phone from Washington because 
Congress came back into session early. 

Davis was not happy with the situation. 
"I think it's always awkward when there is 

not a person there," Davis said. "But the fact that 
so many students showed up was great." 

Although A.S. Vice President Internal Jeff 
Dodge, who organized the event. was initially 
unhappy over the turnout, his satisfaction 
increased as the numbers grew larger as the 
night wore on. 

"The turnout disappointed me at first , but by 
the end I was pleased." Dodge said . "It definitdy 
went well." 

Those in attendance listened as each candi-
date gave an opening statement, followed by 
replies to 10 questions, and finally a closing 
speech. 

Throughout the debate, the candidates were 
able to give their views on such topics as cultur-
al diversity, tax cuts for college students, prayer in 
school and hate crime legislation .. 

Davis said she is in favor of diversity on col-
lege campuses as it is a clear representation of 
the area surrounding the school. 

"[ am very supportive of diversity: Davis said. 
"Congress should look like the nation and the 
school should look like the community." 

Bilbray said he also believes in similar notions 
although he stresses socia-economic diversity. 

"[ find the greatest disadvantage [to students! 
is the economic factor no matter what their color 
or gender is." Bilbray said. "We need to make 
sure that students throughout the country can 
qualify on their merit to 1:et into schools. The 
problem-is three-dimensional. not two." 

Furthering their debate concerning the lives 
of college students, both Bilbray and Davis said 
they were i~ favor of decreasing taxes for college

San Diego Women's League of Voters Visits 
Political group discusses local propositions and issues affecting students 

Senior Staff Writer 

A League of Women Voters rep-
resentative came to the Women's 
Center Wednesday to educate vot-
ers on upcoming ballot proposi-
tions. 

Nancy Loevinger, director of the 
Women's Center, said she was 
impressed by the dozens of people 
that came, and said she hopes that 
many students went away from the 
talk more educated and less intimi-
dated by the ballot propositions. 

Loevinger, an East Coast native, 
said she was intimidated by the 
number of propositions that appear 

on California ballots. She said she 
organized this information session 
because she feels many students 
voting for the first time may feel the 
same way she did. 

Alice McCauley, a member of 
the League of Women Voters, went 
through eight state propositions 
and three local ones. telling atten-
dees about the pros and cons of 
each proposition. 

McCauley said educating voters 
is part of the League's miSsion. 

"The League of Women Voters 
goes .out and talks to various 
groups,~ she said. "We've given 
about 65 talks so far this year." 

After her talk, McCauley briefly 

went through the League's position 
on certain propositions. She said, 
however, that the League only takes 
stands on issues it has thoroughly 
researched. The League opposes 
propositions 34, 37 and 38, and 
supports proposition 39. 

Because the League is a nonpar-
tisan group, McCauley said it does 
not endorse candidates. only issues. 
It does, however, print pamphlets 
consisting of candidates' answers to 
questions posed to them by the 
League. 

McCauley said she likes the fact 
that the League does not endorse 
candidates. 

"[ think it frees us to take action 

on the issues without consideration 
to the candidates: she said. "You're 
not considered a special interest." 

Loevinger said she liked the 
League's presentation because it did 
not push a certain ideology. 

"We want people to feel com-
fortable coming in here regardless 
of who they're voting for," she said. 

She added that the information 
provided by the League will be 
available at the Women's Center 
until the election. 

The Women's Center will co-
sponsor a roundtable discussion on 
Nov. 3 to discuss the privatization 
of education, an issue that will 
appear on the November ballot.

Student Employees May See 
Wage Increase 

A proposal is being made to increase the

ERRATA 

as Assistant II-IV by 2 percent. The only excep-
tion to tM Increase is the Assistant 1 classifica-
tion, which will remain at the state minimum 
wage of$5.75 per hour. 

These classifications are "by agreement" with 
the university, meaning workers' wages do not 
undergo immediate or automatic rate changes 
unless an increase is required to meet the estab-
lished minimum for the Assistant classification. 

The tentative effective date for the proposed 
rate increases would be retroactive to Oct. 1, 
2000 for student employees paid monthly or 
biweekly. Career Services welcomes comments 
on the proposals.

Academic Senate Has First Meeting Large InVe~Ory of Laptops 
Chancellor Dynes commends UCSD for its academic excellence 

NEC, DELL TOOiiba, 199 and

Contributing News Writer 

The Academic Senate's first 
meeting of the school year, held 
Thesday, resulted in the election 
of two representative assembly 
members, Ron Graham and 
Deborah Spector, to the Senate 
Council and the passage of an 
amendment to allow increased 
coordination among groups 
involved in the Committee on 

Debate: 
Both candidates said they 
favored student tax cuts 
ContI ............... 1 
students. 

Over this issue Bilbray attacked 
President Clinton who is currently 
writing legislation to allow tax cuts 
for the parents of college students 
and not college students them-
selves. 

"I think it is arbitrary for this 
just to be for parents,· Bilbray said. 
"Why not for anyone who is will-
ing to make this commitment to go 
to school. The students themselves 
should get the same treatment as 
adults." 

Despite Bilbray's words, Davis 
said she is unsure about Bilbray's 
concern for higher education. 

"I could have pointed out [dur-
ing the debate) his voting against 
higher education, but I chose not 
to; Davis said. "He supported a 
$10 billion cut in money for col-
lege students.· 

This bill, HR-2491, was writ-
ten and voted on four years ago. 
Bilbray was unable to comment as 

Preparatory Education. 
Chancellor Robert Dynes 

addressed the Academic Senate 
and proclaimed that as the uni-
versity approaches its 40th year, it 
is "a breathless time for us, a cam-
pus on the move." 

Dynes reflected upon research 
funding issues, noting that 
according to the California IT 
squared proposal, the state would 
fund three research initiatives on 
UC campuses up to $100 million 

he is still voting in Washington . 
Davis said she supports this tax 

cut due to her belief that all stu-
dents should be able to attend 
school regardless of their financial 
situation. 

"It is very important that every 
child believes that higher educa-
tion is doable," Davis said. "They 
need to believe that they can afford 
it. We must decide what is the most 
important thing to us and this is 
one of them." 

Of equal concern to both can-
didates are the laws preventing 
hate crimes both in the nation and 
in San Diego. Davis said she feels 
that the most important thing is to 
discover the source of the anger for 
hate crimes. 

"We need to recogniz~ hate 
crimes.· she said. "There are rea-
sons why they are committed.· 

Bilbray, on the other hand, said 
that more attention should be 
placed on preventing hate crimes 
for other groups than just minori-
ties. 
, "People always talk.about hate 
crimes that deal with minorities; 
Bilbray said. "But this doesn't 

that it can't happen to 
\individuals] . I don't want 

if the university can match the 
funds with $200 million . Dynes is 
optimistic about finding the 
matching funds. 

"The carrot to this proposal is 
$100 million of state funds, but 
we need to match $200 million: 
Dynes said. "There was disbelief 
that we could do this, but togeth-
er with corporate and private 
funds we've found a match so far 

See aINATE, Page 10 

my kids to be a victim of a hate 
crime no matter what their gen-
der, sexual orientation, or race is. 
Anyone can be a victim: 

Bilbray, who has served as con-
gressman of the 49th district for 
the last six years, believes that the 
work he has done in Washington 
should serve as evidence that he 
should be re-elected. 

"Look how much I have 
accomplished in the last six years," 
Bilbray said. "It is second to none 
in San Diego County and my 
opponent knows that." 

Davis, however, said that she 
should take office after the Nov. 7 
election due to her passion for her 
district and its schools. 

"I do care what happens to our 
community," Davis said. 

"J do what I stand for and I 
stand for building a strong future. I 
have a philosophy that we need to 
leave this place better than we 
found it." 

Regardless of whom the UCSD 
students vote for, Dodge said he 
hopes everyone will go to the polls 
to make a difference. 

"Just remember to go out and 
rock the vote and encourage oth-
ers to do the same," said.

Fee Increase Will 
Help Students 

Last May, Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson formed a committee to discuss a 
proposed $75-per-quarter increase in stu-
dent fees. Most of the money from the 
increase woutd go toward expanding the 
University Centers and funding athletic 
programs. The increase would fund other 
campus improvements as well as student 
organizations. 

Accomodating the anticipated 40-per-
cent increase in students at UCSD will take 
a lot of careful planning, and we feel it is 
best to plan ahead for the upcoming surge 
in enrollment numbers. 

We also feel that it was a wise move on 
Watson's part to include students in the 
process of drafting the fee referendum. We 
will be voting for the fee increase and we 
will be paying the proposed $225 per year. 

The lack of organization in forming the 
committee, however, has led some students 
to be wary of it, and rightfully so. At the sec-
ond commitee meeting, many students 
brought up issues such as the fact that Tom 
Tucker, an associate vice chancellor, was 
one of the co-chairs of the committee. 
Fortunately, Watson removed Tucker as co-
chair. 

Additionally, students were concerned 
that many administrators served on the 
committee as advisers, yet students were not 
represented on the panel. However, the 
solution arose when Arash Kolahi, a UCSD 
student, was appointed as an adviser. Kolahi 
had previously prepared a book for students 
outlining past fee referendums at UCSD 
and other universities. His presence on the 
committee will add a new perspective to the 
issues being discussed. 

The Guardian feels that if student fees are 
going to increase by such a large amount, 
students should be involved in the process. 
We applaud the students that attended last 
Monday's meeting, and we hope they con-
tinue to make their presence felt. 

Administrators also need to realize that if 
they want students to pay more for" services, 
they need to involve students in a system 
that is fair. We feel that after last Monday's 
meeting, Watson's committee is now on its 
way to accomplishing its goal.

Stereotypes of Gays Persist in 
College and Beyond 

Lack of tolerance for diversity amoqgst gays exists even in liberal atmospheres 
By VALEllllIU .... 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

A couple of weeks ago, on a Revelle 
TV show someone went too far. He 
crossed the line, vague as it may be, of 
being overly homophobic. 

A friend of mine who was hosting the 
show received a call. The caller yelled 
homophobic insults into the phone about 
"Mike," as we will refer to this friend of 
mine. The caller labeled Mike gay, for, of 
all things, crossing his legs while sitting . 
down and wearing shorts. Not only was 
Mike's fragile male ego greatly offended. 
but if affected me as well. 

It sparked several questions in my 
mind: If Mike looks "gay: what image 
has society constructed of the gay cul-
ture? Do we all look the same? What do 
gay men. for instance. look like? Do they 
cross their legs and wear shorts? 
Although college is supposed to be a 
place where people of all kinds can live 
harmoniously together. it still seems like 
this issue needs to be addressed. 

I could probably guess most of the 
obvious stereotypes that straight people 
have of gays. These stereotypes would 
include: Gay men are feminine looking 
and great dressers; lesbians generally 
look masculine and could not dress 
themselves to save their lives. 

The UCSD-supported pamphlet 
"Straight Talk About Homosexuality" 
recognizes the' stereotypes "effeminate 
man and masculine woman" as existing, 
but disregards them as being generally 
false for much of the gay population. 

I am not so sure of this. Most of the 
gay people I know relatively conform to 
these stereotypes. They do this either 
naturally or feel like they have to recon-
struct themselves in order to fit in with 
their sexual orientation group. 

There are exceptions to this rule of 
conforming to sexual orientation 
though. Actually, there is a whole spec-
trum of appearances for gays and les-
bians. For men, it ranges from the raving 
queen to the Abercrombie, pretty-boy. 
masculine look to the ultra-masculine. 
often-br.arded but always with a five 

o'clock shadow. For women there is the 
stereotypical butch dyke, to those who 
are androgynous, and then on to the 
"lipstick" lesbian. who is ultra-femme 
and can pass for straight easily. By just 
defining these categories. I am giving 
stereotypes myself. 

Why do gays have to appear different 
than straight people? Some say it is for 
sexual survival. Human beings are natu-
rally monogamous and inherently yearn 
for a significant other. Having distin-
guishing features such as short hair for 
lesbians and feminine qualities for guys 
can be a sexual invitation to the general 
public. In a society where · gays are 
repressed. this is an easy and inconspic-
uous way of achieving such results. This 
behavior often attracts the types of peo-
ple that gays are looking to be friends 
with. if not potential significant others. If 
one accepts such people despite their 
obvious nonconformity to society, one is 
probably a prospective friend for them . 

Homosexuals have st6reotypes of 
themselves as well . The other night I was 
in Hillcrest hanging out with friends 
when a lesbian couple walked by. One of 
my friends commented. "Ah that's sad. 
they look so straight.· It made me angry 
inside to hear that from someone who I 
thought would be so understanding of 
other types of people. 

It is ironic how the group that is dis-
criminated against most discriminates 
against differences in its own kind. I feel 
that there is definite friction between dif-
ferent subcultures of each sex of the gay 
community. By fulfilling certain stereo-
types such as cuning one's hair or getting 
piercings. one is reaching for a fuller 
acceptance of the lesbian subculture. My 
guy friends tell me "don't give in, keep 
your longer hair and your femininity." In 
the next sentence. they'll jokingly say "so 
when arc you gonna cut your hair?" I 
understand that they arc being sarastic. 
but at the same time they are serious. I 
think they assume it is only a matter of 
time before I give in and chop my locks off. 

As • concerned college student, I 
would like to question the stereotypes 
discussed in this anicle. Many students 

such as myself dislike these stereotypes 
and resent feeling peer pressure to con-
form to them. In doing what some con-
sider rebelling against society. a lot of 
young people are actually reconstructing 
themselves to fit the social norm. With 
such actions, these stereotypes are 
ingrained deeper into our society and 
subsequently allow less room for individ-
ual thought and freedom. 

For clarification, I am speaking to 
straight college students as well as queer 
ones. Straight college students want to 
conform to stereotypes just as much as 
gay ones do. Why shop at Abercrombie? 
Because you are trying to complete that 
look, the one everyone yearns for. Why 
cut your hair? It's what all the other les-
bians are doing. 

On Iy by rejecting the stereotypes 
expected by society can college students 
create their own identities without fear of 
discrimination from the general public. 
By conforming to expected stereotypes 
we make discrimination possible. Sadly, 
targets of discrimination are usually 
those who distinguish themselves the 
most from the general population. 

With this topic. another issue 
emerges: Where do you draw the line in 
terms of avoiding discrimination? Where 
do you stop sacrificing your individual 
freedom for the greater good? 
Personally. I am in favor of individual . 
expression. Diversity is a beautiful thing; 
it's what makes this world worth living 
in. But when a certain group of people 
typecast themselves through appearance. 
it makes it difficult for them not only to 
~void discrimination, but it also causes 
inore friction within their subculture 
toward those who do not model them-
selves as such . 

In conclusion. I do not mean to alien-
ate those who choose individual forms of 
expression for purposes of fulfilling their 
natural identity. But for those of you who 
socially construct younelves to fit in, jU$t 
remember, you do not have to. In saying 
this I do not mean to discourage diversi-
ty, but the opposite; I mean to encourage 
divenity and accordingly discard harm-
ful stereotypes.

devoid of any contact with reality as 
the previous two: debates in which 
the color of a shirt. the fit of a jack-

preciously little anyway, and in 
which the main rhetorical exercise

both candidates are such prisoners

to hinge on "leadership qualities· or,

Speaking WIth 49th District Congressman lilian Illbray 
Republican Congressman discusses issues pertinent to voters in upcoming election 

Senior Staff Writer 

With the elections just two weeks 
away, the race between incumbent 
Congressman Brian Bilbray and 
challenger Susan Davis for the 49th 
Congressional District is so close 
that every vote counts. The student 
vote has become a highly contested 
commodity. For once, students have 
the chance to influence the outcome 
of an election that will determine 
which party controls Conress. 

Since I am a politica junkie. I 
wanted to interview Bilbray to dis-
cover whether he is worthy of being. 
re-elected and to find out if he is in 
touch with the issues that concern 
college students. Being a natural-
born cynic, I prepared a full slate of 
student issues with which, to hit 
Bilbray. 

I had planned to interview 
Bilbray in person last Tuesday, but 
the Congressman is one busy per-
son, juggling simultaneou.sly his 
responsibilities for the people of San 
Diego in Washington, D.C., his re-
election campaign and his obliga-
tions to his family. 

My . long-awaited face-to-face 
interview turned into a phone inter-
view. 

The first thing that surprised me 
about Bilbray is his unbending 
stance on the issue of abortion. 
Unlike many of his Republican 
counterparts. Bilbray supports abor-
tion rights. 

"I am absolutely pro-choice," 
Bilbray said. "I think anyone who 
believes in the Constitution has to. 
look at the fact that a woman's right 
to choose her reproductive choices 
is not only a right, but a responsibil-
ity that she bears alone, and no one. 
especially big government. can 
supercede that." 

With many left-wing politicians 
c1aimin~ the only way to ensure a 
woman s right to abortion is to vote 
for Democrats in the coming elec-
tion, Bilbray's protective stance on 
abortion is not only refreshing but 
provides voters with a viable alterna-
tive. 

Another issue of concern to 
many college students is the envi-
ronment, which Bilbray has a proven 
track record of protecting. 

Bilbray has established a reputa-
tion as a leader not afraid to take 
needed action on behalf of the envi-
ronment. 

"I'm probably the only member 
of Congress who has had their 
Miranda rights read to them over the 

pollution problem." Bilbray said. 
"I've been fighting sewage problems 
along the border since I was 24 years 
old." 

In 1980, when federal authorities 
denied requests by local officials to 
build an emergency wall in the 
Ttiuana River Valley to block raw 
sewage from flowing into the United 
States, Bilbray, then mayor of 
Imperial Beach, took direct action 
before the health of area residen ts 
was endangered. Bilbray mounted a 
skiploader and personally construct-
ed the wall in defiance of federal 
bureaucrats. 

Bilbray's leadership and commit-
ment to the environment has been 
displayed time and time again dur-
ing his three tenns in Congress. 
Bilbray authored the Otay Mountain 
Wilderness Act of 1999, which des-
ignates 18,500 acres of Otay 
Mountain as federally protected 
wilderness. Bilbray's Beach Bill was 
recently passed into law and creates 
universal standards of water quality 
testing in recreational beaches 
across the na tion. 

What struck me during the inter-
view was Bilbray's obvious sincerity 
and the deep commitment he has for 
the people of San Diego. 

"My first priority is to represent 

his district, not special interests." 
Bilbray said, "When I went to 
Washington I promised to reform 
welfare, balance the budget. fix 
Social Security, take care of the envi-
ronment, improve education and 
pay down the debt. ·1 want to finish 
that." 

The biggest reason Bilbray sees 
for why students should vote for 
him and not his opponent,is 
because he has already accom-
plished what his opponent is 
promising. 

"I have delivered what Susan 
Davis is promising." Bilbray said. 

Bilbray also said the people of 
San Diego need a leader who can 
bring both Republicans and 
Democrats together for the good of 
society. 

"I've been working with 
Democrats and Republicans to 
make things happen, lilee the Beach 
Bill, Clean Air Bill, the Wilderness 
Bill." Bilbray said. "You need some-
one to work with both sides. and I've 
proven I ca n do tha t." 

When I asked Bilbray what the 
one thing was that he wanted stu-
dents to know about him, he did not 
even pause before answering. 

He chuckled as he said, "That 
I'm a better surfer than Susan

Bilbray urged students to exercise 

their right to vote, saying the student 
vote is critically important for the 
outcome of the race. Bilbray hopes 
students will realize that what is 
being voted on today will affect what 
happens in 20 years. when students 
are adults. 

"Students may not think it will 
affect them, but it will affect them 
more than anyone in society: 
Bilbray said. "So actually, young 
people have more to gain or lose in 
th is process. • 

It is clear that the political fate of 
our state and nation rests in our 
hands. With just the student popula-
tions of UCSD and San Diego State 
University, we can tum the tide of an 
election. . 

[t may be true that one individual 
cannot make a difference with just 
one vote, but our collective student 
vote can wield enormous political 
power. The power to influence the 
political process is just a vote away, 
come Nov. 7. 

After interviewing Bilbray, I was 
moved by his genuine concern for 
the welfare of his constituents and 
his impressive leadership abilities on 
the issues. I believe that Bilbray is a 
candidate worthy of being reelected.

Politicians 
Candidates deserve OsCIJrs 
for best performances 
C ................... . 

A few days ago, I was watching 
an interview with Ralph Nader on 
UCSD-TV. Answering the question 
of how he would reduce the mili-
tary budget, he started citing specif-
ic programs and military orienta-
tion that, according to the experts 
of the Pentagon, are a waste of 
money and are doing nothing for 
American interests. He then pro-
ceeded to show how these savings 
could amount to $100 billion, even 
using part of the savings to increase 
the pay of the military personnel, 
and still not affect national security. 
He showed, citing data and statis-
tics. how this money could be used 
to reduce the gap between the few 
rich and the many poor in the 
country. 

You may disagree politically with 
Nader about the desirability of gov-
ernment intervention in certain 
areas. but you must admit that he 
knows what he is talking about. You 
will not hear him on network TY, 
because an analysis such as his can-
not be compressed in a three-sec-
ond sound bite. You can probably 
find him on C-Span, so judge for 
yourself. You would be hard-
pressed to find- any of these facts in 
the presidential debates. 

All we could deduce from the 
debates is that Bush is no friend of 
English grammar (he has some very 
personal ideas on the agreement 
between subject and verb) and that, 
instead of administering the surplus 
intelligently for the times in which 
the economy will nOt be so goodJ 
we should squander it on a tax cur 
for the wealthy, and gamble the 
country's retirement safety net on 
the stock market. 

Gore responded with that terri-
ble statement, which I Wish I had 
never heard coming from a 
Democrat, that the whole Kosovo 
campaign had been resolved with· 
out a single human casualty. 
Evidently Serbs, Kosovars and 
Albanians are members of some 
subhuman race. He corrected the 
statement to say "no loss of 
American lives:' but too late and to 
no avail: His Christian upbringing 
should have taught him that a Serb 
or an Albanian life is as precious as 
an American life. 

The truth is that we have not 
seen three debates between two 
politicians: We saw a duel between 
two actors, with completely scripted 
parts, looking for the right occasion 
to repeat the same sound bite over 
and over: "fuzzy math, fuzzy math." 
and, fortunately, Bush's coaches 
dug out the term "fuzzy;" I doubt he 
could have pronounced a term like 
"indistinct" or "obscure." The can-
didates worried that the color of 
their shirts would look good on TV 
and went on trying to pull the next 
trick from a well-stocked bag. 

One thing is clear from the pres-
idential debate: Reality has com-
pletely left the political arena. In the 
age of TV everything is reduced to 
the same mish-mash of entertain-
ment, glitter and fantasy. Nader 
and libertarian candidate Harry 
Browne - the latter with opinions I 
personally disapprove of but, then 
again, disagreement is supposed to 
be the juice of democracy - deal 
with reality, and therefore they had 
no place in the debates or in the 
current political panorama. 

We look at the debates as we 
look at the Oscar ceremony: with 
an eye to the clothes. another eye to 
the after-ceremony parties and an 
almost complete disregard for cine-
ma. Modem elections are the polit-
ical Oscars: the glitter attracts view-
er, we want to see whether the 
politicians look good, if they look 
tired or if they put on weight. The 
underlying political activity docs 
not really matter, as long as it pro-
vides the material for a good show. 
Unfortunately, if the polls continue 
to go this way, this year the Oscar 
will g:> to Forrest Gump.

~D & NATION 
A Palestinian Official's Attitude Reflects 
Unraveling of Peace Process 

RAMALLAH, West Bank -
To hear Ahmed Qurei declare the 
Oslo peace track all but dead is to 
realize how much has unraveled 
in the last few weeks. 

Perhaps more than anyone 
else, Qurei embodied the 
Palestinian leadership'S commit-
ment to the rocky peace effort 
that began secretly in the 
Norwegian woods. where he him-
self walked leafy paths with Israeli 
officials and transformed himself 
from underground leader into a 
Palestinian architect of the Oslo 
interim peace agreement of 1993. 

~ince then, he has assumed 
the role of business-like negotia-
tor trusted by a series of Israeli 
and American officials for his 
access to Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestinian leader, and his ability 
to close a deal. 

Now, however, Qurei has 
entered another era. He has not 
exactly buried Oslo, not publicly. 
To do so would be to turn his 
back too unequivocally on a 
process in which he has invested 
more than seven years. It would 
be, in effect, to say to th~ 
Palestinian opposition and to tht! 
Palestinian man on the street that 

they were right, the process was 
bankrupt after all. 

But Qurei, who is known as 
Abu Ala, did say on Wednesday 
tliat "the negotiations have 
become useless." He shrugged off 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak's "timeout" from the peace 
talks, saying "whether time out or 
time in, I don't see the differ-
ence." And he repudiated the for-
mat that he has accepted for 
years, American-brokered talks 
built on the original Oslo agree-
ment and aimed toward a final 
peace accord that was supposed 
to have been sealed in May 1999. 

"There will have to be a new 
formula, a new structure" with 
"other international powers 
besides the U.S." assisting in the 
effort, Qurei said, betraying a new 
distrust of Washington'S ability to 
act as a mediator. "The old for-
mula cannot be accepted any-
more and doesn't lead to a per-
manent deal. There is no more 
trust between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians." 

In response, Israel's acting for-
eign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, 
who just last spring haq a close 
working relationship with Qurei. 

insisted that it was premature to 
talk about the end of Oslo. If the 
violence stops, the three-way talks 
can be restarted; it would be fruit-
less to throwaway the carefully 
negotiated agreements that 
already exist, he said. . 

Smiling broadly, however, 
Qurei said acidly that Ben Ami, a 
soft-spoken academic and long-
time dove, was "a general now." 
He was referring to what 
Palestinians have been calling 
Israel's " war" against them, the 
conflict that has left more than 
130 dead, almost all Palestinians. 

The Israelis have been saying 
that Arafat is no longer a "peace 
partner." Qurei said on 
Wednesday that Arafat was just 
not willing to be a partner in the 
peace that Israel , backed by the 
Americans, was trying to 
"impose" - first at Camp David 
in July, and now "through force." 

"We know Mr. Barak came 
with a peace program and now 
he 's ended with a war program: 
he said. "He's preparing for the 
re-occupation of the West Bank."

Studies Show Ordinary People Can 
Save Lives with Defibrillators 

DALLAS - Many people who 
suffer cardiac arrest and would 
otherwise die can be saved if ordi-
nary people are trained to use 
defibrillators to shock them back 
to life, researchers are reporting 
Thursday. 

In two studies in the New 
England Journal of Medicine, one 
conducted at casinos and the 
other on airliners, survival rates 
were 53 percent and 40 percent 
for people who had cardiac arrest 
and who were treated almost 
immediately with portable defib-
rillators, a smaller version of the 
electrical paddles used in emer-
gency rooms. 

Those survival rates are far 
better than overall rates in the 
United States, which are dismally 
low, 2 percent to 5 percent, 
because most victims are not 
defibrillated fast enough. About 
225,000 Americans a year suffer 
cardiac arrest. Ideally, the shock to 
the chest should be given within 
three minutes of the victim's col-
lapse. It is unlikely to work after 
10 minutes. 

The people in the studies were 
treated with a portable defibrilla-
tor that first monitored the heart 
and then shocked it only if the 
machine detected a particular 
abnormal rhythm, ventricular fib-
rillation, which accounts for 80 
percent of all cases of cardiac 
arrest . . 

In that condition, the main 
pumping chamber of the heart 
quivers instead of beating, and 
loses the ability to pump blood. 
Shocking someone with another 
type of heart problem could be 
dangerous or fatal. 

The machine will not fire if a 
patient's heart has no electrical 
activity because a shock will not 
restart it . The machines have 
recorded voices that instruct 
users. 

Researchers at the University 
of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center at Dallas, found that six of 
15 passengers on American 
Airlines who needed shocks from 
June 1997 to July 1999 survived. 
The defibrillators were also used 
to monitor about 180 others who 

became ill during flights. The air-
line now includes the devices on 
all flights and has trained 24,000 
flight attendants to use them. 

More than 70 casinos, most in 
Nevada, now have defibrillators, 
according to Richard Hardman, 
an author of the casino study. 

A surveillance tape fi'om one of 
the casinos shows a man collaps-
ing at a roulette table. Guards 
remove his shirt and shave his 
chest. The guards slap two adhe-
sive patches, containing electrodes, 
onto the man's chest. Within sec-
onds, the defibrillator commands 
them to deliver a shock. 

One presses a button and the 
man's body jerks as the defibrilla-
tor fires. The victim's heart rate 
and breathing are restored. An 
ambulance team wheels him out 
on a stretcher, past scores of gam-
blers, most oblivious to the fact 
that a marr has essentia lly died 
and been brought back to life in 
their midst.

California; 
The state's situation 
reflects overall volatility 
ContI ... ed fronI ..... 1 
nonpartisan Public Policy Institute 
of California, whose lates t 
statewide poll ending last week 
found that Gore's lead over Bush 
had shrunk to 5 points among like-
ly voters, 44 percent to 39 percent, 
with 6 percent for Nader. 

That is half the size of Gore's 
lead in the same poll a month ago, 
and some Democratic consultants 
say their own private surveys show 
the race even closer (within the 
margin of sampling error) among 
the likeliest voters. A Los Angeles 
Times poll concluded Monday and 
published Wednesday showed 
Gore with a 7-point lead over 
Bush, 48 percent to 41 percent, 
with Nader at 5 percent. 

The unsettled situation in 
California reflects the overall 
volatility of a close race. 

"We have a triple threat," said 
Paul Maslin, a California-based 
Democratic pollster for Gov. Gray 
Davis and other national figures. 
"They have more money, their base 
has more energy and we have a 
drag from Nader." ' 

Bush still faces formidable 
obstacles here. Gore still holds a 

Victory: 
One of the main parties 
called for a new election 
ContInued from pale 1 
few African countries never to 
have had experienced military 
rule, . remai ned unclear 
Wednesday night. 

With the popular revolt, a 
fierce political battle now looms 
before the country. The general's 
main opponent in Sunday'S elec-
tion , Laurent Gbagbo, declared 
himself president Wednesday, and 
on state telev isio n Wednesday 
night the army chief of staff, Gen . 
Soumaila Diabakate, said the 
armed forces were now behind 
Gbagbo. 

But at least one of the main 
political parties said it would not 
recognize the results and called for 
a new election , The balloting 
Sunday, which many Ivoirians and 
Western nations considered deeply 
flawed , excluded major party can-
didates and was boycotted by large 
portions of the population . 

Nevertheless, a 10-month-long 
period of military dictatorship in 
this former French co lony 
appeared to have reached its end, 
raising the possibility that the 

comfortable advantage among vot-
ers on most issues, from education 
to health care, Social Security and 
Medicare, and the Los Angeles 
Times poll shows just over half of 
California voters have an unfavor-
able opinion of Bush, while six in 
10 view Gore favorably. 

And even Bush 's advisers here 
are cautious in a state where 
Democrats hold an ll-point edge 
in voter registration, contro l all but 
one statewide office and both 
houses of the Legislature. 

"I know people didn 't believe 
us, and it's been an uphill battle: 
Gerald Parsky, Bush's state cam-
paign chairman, said, "But I really 
think we've made progress. I 
believe if we can be within 5 points 
on Election Day, then our grass-
roots effort can put us over the 
top: 

Still, Gore campaign officials 
profess confidence. 

"Every piece of evidence that 
we rely on shows that AI Gore 
remains in a very strong position 
in California," said senior cam-
paign spokesman Mark Fabiani. 
"It's obviollsly a critical state for 
us. But AI Gore's positions on the 
issues are so much more in sync 
with Californians than Bush's 
are."

Ivory Coast might reassume its 
trad itional role as an economic 
and political anchor for the 
region. 

In what quickly became one of' 
the first times a popular uprising 
in support of democratic process 
had dislodged a dictator in Africa, 
residents of the West African 
nation on Wednesday pushed 
through military barricades erect-
ed around the city center and the 
presidential palace. The protest-
ers, many marching in flip-flops, 
were unarmed. 

"The mistake Guei ' made was 
to let us watch scenes from 
Belgrade: said Alfred Tohouri, a 
31-year-old student , referring to 
the fall of Slobodan Milosevic 
after a contested election in 
Yugoslavia, as he made his way 
through the thic~ crowds stand -
ing Wednesday morning in front 
of a tank in the city center. 

Half an hour later, scores of 
gen'darmes wrested away the state 
television building from loyalist 
soldiers, an event that also echoed 
the Serb revolt . "We are free!" 
shouted Hermann Karamo, one of 
the pro testers. "It's freedom for 
the Ivory Coast! "

Pushed by Democratic Party, Nader Pushes Back at Gore 
WASHINGTON - In the face 

of growing efforts by the 
Democratic Party and its allies to 
deflate his support, Ralph Nader, 
the Green Party candidate for pres-
ident, lashed more sharply than 
ever into Vice President AI Gore on 
Wednesday, accusing him of 
repeatedly ·breaking promises to 
clean up the environment, help the 
poor and reform the federal gov-
ernment. 

"AI Gore is suffering from elec-
tion-year delusion if he thinks his 
record on the environment is any-
thing to be proud of: Nader said at 
a packed news conference near the 
White House. "He should be held 
accountable by voters for eight 

years of principles betrayed and 
promises broken." 

Nader's remarks come as Gore's 
supporters within the liberal wing 
of the Democratic Party have 
mounted an aggressive campaign 
using rallies, television commer-
cials and phone banks to dissuade 
people in several closely contested 
states from voting for Nader. 

On Wednesday, for example. offi-
cials with the National Abortion and 
Reproductive Rights Action League 
said the group would begin running 
television commercials in Portland, 
Ore.; Minneapolis; and Madison, 
Wis., late this week, "g people 
who support abortion nghts not to 
vote for Nader, on the premise that 

Nader said Hft>dnesday 
that he had also been 
called by prominent 
Democrats and labor 
leaders, including Rep, 
John Conyers Jr. of 
Michigan, urging him to 
quit the race, 
the c:lection of George W Bush 
would lead to a Supreme Court that 
would overturn those rights. 

Nader said Wednesday that he 
had also been called by prominent 

Democrats and labor leaders, 
including Rep. John Conyers Jr. of 
Michigan, urging him to quit the 
race. But he scoffed at the effort, 
saying it was merely helping him 
commu nicate his anticorporate, 
pro-third -party message to disen-
chanted, disengaged vo ters. 

"It's actually giving us greater 
publici ty: he said of the 
Democrat ic Party campaign 
against him . "Let these Democrats 
be more vociferous." 

Democratic Party officials and 
their allies in the labor, women 's 
and environmental movements are 
concerned that Nader is drawing 
away just enough liberal voters in 
several states, including Wisconsin, 

Minnesota, Oregon and 
Washington, to threaten Gore's 
chdnces of winning the election . 

Nader opened his news confer-
ence by attacking th~ Clinton 
administration as having failed to 
improve the condition of the poor. 
He contended that most low-
income workers make less today in 
inflation-adjusted dollars than they 
did in the 1970s. And he called for 
raising the minimum wage to $8.50 
an hour, from $5.15; repealing laws 
that restrict labor organizing; and 
devoting much of the federal surplus 
to a "Marshall Plan" to rebuild cities.

demonstrated." Hillyard said. "Our 
results suggest that you will see an 
object or event more clearly if it 
makes a sound before you see it.· 

Hillyard said he considers the 
findings a first step to helping 
researchers better understand 
mental disorders, such as attention 
deficit disorder and schizophrenia. 
Industrially, the study opens possi-
bilities of safer warning systems 
and man-machine interfaces 
where attention is crucial. such as 
air-traffic control systems. 

"Audio/visual and brain elec-
tricity studies such as this give us a 
clearer picture of how the brain 
works and can greatly cbntribute 
to the world of neuroscience in the 
field of human selective attention 
as well as having real world appli-
cations," McDonald said. "My 

interest is in looking at interac-
tions between sensory modalities 
and ultimately see how people per-
ceive objects in the real world." 

Not only did the researchers 
observe behavioral reactions to 
sound and sight, but they also 
recorded brain waves and electri-
cal patterns that are associated 
with people's sensory experience 
as an attempt to see where the 
brain analyzes sensory informa-
tion. 

"No one study can show how 
the brain puts together both audi-
tory and visual inputs." HiUyard 
said. "But this study is a first step 
to understanding this.· 

The next phase for research 
includes more studies of normal 
brain function involving different 
senses and comparisons to indi-
viduals with abnormal brain func-
tion. 

UCSD is a leader in cognitive 
neuroscience and is one of the 
world's most advanced centers for 
this type of research, according to 
Hillyard.

and Israeli conflict as an example. 

"We are being called to stand 
by and to mediate and to 'inter-be' 
with these people,· Walker said. 

She went on to read an excerpt 
from a piece entitled "Let the 
Women Talk" which was written 
by an author in Tel Aviv. The piece 
calls for the Israeli and Palestinian 
women to come forward and "try 
to make sense where men could 
not." The work admonished the 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders. 

"Too many men, too many 
egos (are) involved in the burning 
of this land: Walker read. "We are 
scared. We want them to be scared 
too. Jerusalem can be shared. This 
whole area can be shared." 

According to Bob Baldock, a 
KPFA radio spOkesperson, the 
event was a benefit for the 
Berkeley radio station, as well as 
for the Berkeley Eco House, a 
nonprofit organization dedicated 
to the creation of environmentally 
sound homes. 

Medea Benjamin, the 
California Green Party candidate 
for Senate and a friend of 
Walker's, imroduced Walker as 
the author of seven best-selling 
books and numerous short sto-
ries, essays, volumes of poetry and 
children 's books. Walker is per-
haps best known for her novel 
"The Color Purple: for which she 
won the Pulitzer Prize and tbe 
American Book Award . Her work 
has been translated into 25 lan-
guages, Benjamin said .

WASHINGTON - A college 
campus may be littered with cam-
paign posters and tables selling 

. political T-shirts, but that doesn 't 
mean the average student will 
leave their cell phone conversa-
tion to think about what's going 
on. For a lot of students, ·politics· 
doesn't go beyond a few dinner 
conversations .they had with their 
parents back in high school. 
Although Georgetown University 
is somewhat of an exception 
because of its location, even here 
there did not seem to be all that 
much interest in the three presi-
dential debates, especially since 
they landed right smack in the 
middle of midterm season. 

Yet there is a group of people 
on every campus that knows the 
ins and outs of political life - the 
issues, the platforms and the scan-
dals. At Georgetown, these poli~i­
cians in the making have worked 
to infiltrate the student body to an 
impressive degree. 

There are five political clubs 
on campus that have different 
functions and take radically differ-
ent stands on issues. bu t in the 
end, they are all working toward 
the same goal - to increase stu-
dent activism in politics. 

At the national level, this 
motto has been interpreted in the 
strictest of terms by three stu-
dents who substituted bumper 
stickers for midterms when they 
decided to take time off from 
school to work 17- hour days on 
national campaigns around th ~ 
country. 

And at the local level. 
Georgetown students are always 
working to increase student 
awareness. That awareness and 
involvement has culminated in 
the decision of two students to 
run for loca l offices. 

As midterms come to an ('nd at 
Georgetown and more and more 

• people begin to venture out of 
their studying holes in the library, 
three students are getting pre-
pared for their upcoming election.

In this new Hollywood flick, 
Brendan Fraser ("Blast from the 
Past") plays a lonely, degenerate 
technical support advisor, Elliot 
Richards. He has absolutely no 
friends - even his co-workers 
despise him. Though he has a 
good heart, the harder he tries, 
the more they push him away 
and make a mockery of him. All 
he wants is a girlfriend who will 
love him, but he has had a crush 
on a girl in the office for four 
years, and she does not even 

know he is alive. 
One night Richards runs into 

the devil (Elizabeth Hurley, 
"Austin Powers"), who is a sexy 
seductress, to his surprise. They 
make a typical deal- his soul for 
seven wishes. Sure, Richards can 
make any linle wish his heart 
desires, but the devil always 
knows how to undermine his 
wishes to make his life a living 
hell . Can being rich, powerful 
and in love be all that he has 
dreamed of, or is he forgetting to 
fill in some of the details?

that he is a doormat. He displays 
hilarious reactions to the cata-

Hurley also gives a surpris-
ingly acceptable performance as 
a fierce, naughty and downright 
nasty Lucifer. The storyline and 
the situations are not surprising-

have its moments. 

One thing is for sure: The

Understanding the Art of Marketing Popular Music 
The music industry leaves you cruisin' with a bruisin' at South by South West 
By KRlsnN WITHERS 
Staff Writer 

A few months ago I was fortu-
nate ~nough to make a business trip 
to Auslln, Tt:xas, compliments of the 
Internet musIc company, I work for. 

If there's anything that I learned 
in colkgc, it 's not to pass up a fret: 
I11cal - or a free trip, for that matter. 
I had 110 idcJ when I got the job that 
promoting music and handing out 
flyers would end up taking me to 
one of the most interesting and tir-
ing events of my college career, let 
alone supply me fo r one week with a 
killer hotel room, free food, open 
bar and nonstop amazing shows 
every night until 3 a.m. 

Yeah, I know what you're think-
ing. Why in the hell would anyone 
want to go to Austin? 

Contrary to popular belief, 
Austin has no cowboys, no rolling 
plains and not a single head of big 
hair. Austin hosts the biggest music 
conference in the nation. Put 7, 000 
musicians and record moguls 
together and you have the music 
industry'S nonstop party, better 
known as South by South West. For 
one week Austin hosts over 1,000 
acts, showcasing the cream of the 
crop - new up-and-coming bands 
from all over the world, and the best 
barbecue this side of the Mississip-
pi. 

So as I'm on my way to Texas, 
sitting between the CEO for Spin 
magazine and some indie musician 
sporting yellow leather pants. I'm 
wondering how I got here. I'm not a 
musician (well, other than singing in 
the shower) and I'm not up there on 
the industry's corporate ladder, but I 
do know my music. 

I was overwhelmed by "the 

industry's" presence upon my 
arrival at Austin-Bergstrom Interna-
tional Airpol1. There were bands 
performing at Gate 26 and in the 
airport's food court, right smack in 

. front of Arby's. I wasn't even in the 
ccnter of all the action and people 
werl! already throwing themselves 
onto anyone that looked capable of 
signing a re ord deal for them. This 
was defini tely going to be a tiring 
trip: work hard, play hard. 

This proved to be true the 
moment I entered my hotel lobby. A 
stack of 3,000 company flyers pro-
moting a talent show were shoved 
into my arms and needed to be 
stuffed under hotel doors and 
placed in every club by midnight. 
The competition was so stiff and the 
rivalry so obnoxious that it threat-
ened my enjoyment, my reason for 
being there in the first place - the 
music. I was being stickered by 20 
different Internet stan-ups while 
watching a belligerent representa-
tive for College Broadcast streak 
across the stage screaming uniden-
tifiable marketing slurs. 

Since when did a music confer-
ence become a popularity contest? 
The countdown to my self-destruc-
tion started day one. Dot-com vs. 
dot-com, the battle of the industry 
had begun. 

By day, South By South West 
took over the Austin Convention 
Center with a trade show exhibiting 
countless newborn Internet music 
sites. These were pretty much iden-
tical to one another, varying only in 
each one's choice of gimmicky give-. 
aways. By the end of the fifth day I 
had so much free schwag, it was a 
miracle that America r! Airlines let 
me back onto the plane. 

I have to admit, free loot was the 

\..UCKY BRAND 

Presents 
the 

only way for companies to single 
themselves out in the sea of 'Net 
start-ups. I scavenged everything 
from wind-up, fire-spitting Godzil-
las, guitar picks, shot glasses (on a 
string, no less), vintage band posters 
and, if I got up early enough, fresh 
waffles, at the rockrgirl.com booth. 

With over 500 different compa-
nies under one roof, it was surpris-
ing that so many were of no interest 
to me - dare I say, wasted Internet 
space? Look,just because the Inter-
net is the preferred marketing tOol 

Since when did a music 
conference become a 
popularity contest? The 
countdiJwn to my self-
destruction started day 
one. Dot-com vs. dot-com, 
the battle of the industry 
had begun. 

these days doesn't mean that every-
one should put up a site. I mean, 
guitarpickcleaning.com? I just 
throw mine away and get a new one. 

Aside from that, nothing hap-
pened during the day other than 
schmoozing one's way onto a guest 
list. Here's where the truth of Austin 
come out, where I divulge the mis-
fonunes of South by South West's 
politics. 

By night, South by South West 
doubled 'in population. It was like 
Disneyland - shoulder to shoulder 
but without baby strollers. There 
were even more bars than those in 
Pacific Beach and the Gaslamp put 

together. In order even to be 
ackriowledged as a person in Austin, 
you had to be spol1ing an $80 (lim-
ited access) wrist band or tht: VIP 
badge, al $300 a pop. To be qllltt' 
honest, the wrist bands weren't even 
a solid guarantee. I saw a lot of angry 
wrist-band-wearers watching shows 
out on the street through the win-
dows. 

I began to discover that things 
were not as cut-throat as I thought. 
If you have the money, you are auto-
mati ally given first priority. I'm not 
just talking aboul the passes - even 
for the lTlusicians trying to get 
signed, money and image was every-
thing in Austin. Even if you were 
sporting the same y IP badge as the 
guy next to you, one of you will have 
priority over the other - either it's 
because you look better in snake-
skin pants or you're standing in line 
with Janeane Garofalo. 

South by South West began to 
take its toll on me by day four. It 
might have been' the fact that I was 
force-fed eight margaritas by the 
boys of Tenacious D the night 
before, or simply that I was disap-
pointed in the principles of the 
music industry. Not only do boy 

-bands and Britney Spears make me 
bitter, but the people who create 
these ·stars" were everywhere, and 
they're 10 times worse, promoting 
money-hungry, gimmicky plots to 
change the way the world sees 
music. They walk about scouting 
out possible candidates that they 
can mold to their "standard." It's like 
a mass-cloning mission. Just think-
ing about them makes me bitter! 

Upon my return home, I was 
cranky from being awake 48 hours 
straight, having boarded the plane at 
5 a.m. after leaving a rave at 4 a.m. I 

was also cranky from dealing with 
one-too-many mainstream produc-
ers. 

Again I ask: What is becoming of 
music? It's like they've forgotten 
that talent is an issue. A lot of the 
best bands at the conference were 
being considered only if they were 
willing to modify a few things. Mod-
ify what? Thei r image? It's a good 
thing I was ther.: for the musi ,and 
I gladly reminded -myself of that 
each night, so I could enjoy myself. 
With all frustration aside, Austin 
provided a great showcase of talent. 
My enjoyment of music has been 
rekindled. 

With that in mind, let'S talk 
about the bands and leave aside my 
disappointment for the industry and 
its standards. The scene is punish-
ing me, but at least musicians are 
fighting back and creating original 
music. Here are my picks for the 
best up-and-coming musicians fea-
tured at South By South West: 

At the Drive-In (EI Paso, Texas): 
Energy. That's what comes to mind 
when I think of this band. Energy 
and passion. The lead singer not 
only falls to the floor with epileptic-
like spasms, he bounces back and 
forth on the stage, frequently plant-
ing handstands on the drum set. 
The band is successful in getting the 
crowd involved with the show, 
sporting self-grown afros and tight 
T-shins. They are the epitome of the 
emo scene and played an amazing 
70-minute set. The club was tiny, 
but even from the back of the room 
you could get into the performance. 
Every song sounds different and is 
equally good. These guys are defi-
nitely one of my favorite bands of

South: 
Too marry mainstream 
producers can create havoc 
ContInued rr... ..... 14 
the moment, and I highly recom-
mend buying one of their albums: 
"I n/Casino/Out," on Fearless 
Records; or "Relalionship of Com-
mand," on Grand Royal. 

The Causey Way (Gainesville, 
Aa.): The stage was humorously set 
up as an altar to the lead singer, 
sporting candles. cheesy Sears por-
traits, flower bouquets and a key-
boardist wearing a bicycle helmet. 
The five-piece band wore lab coats 
and nurse outfits. an almost a blind-
ing sight under the blacklights. The 
singer has a very unique voice, half-
speaking and half-singing. The 
words "he's so purrrr-fect, he 's so 
puuurmfect like a pussy cat" are 
still stuck in my head. I was flashing 
back to all those '80s classic cult 
bands and how they had the unbe-
lievable ability to make me an 
instant groupie. Check these guys 
out on the Riffage Web si te, 
http://www·riffage.com. 

Back Yard Babies (Stockholm, 
Sweden): Good old-fashioned punk 
is back. even if we have to import it 
from Sweden. I think I fell in love 
with them the moment I caught a 
glance of their lO-inch mohawks 
and spiked leather jackets. It was the 
same rush of excitement as when I 
bought my first Operation Ivy cas-
sette in the '80s. Granted, I couldn't 
understand a word they were saying 
- their music broke the language 
barrier and they were hilarious per-
formers. Besides, it seems that 
swearing is the universal way to get 
a crowd cheering for you. I even rec-
ommend these guys after the expe-
rience of having the lead singer 
hock a loogie on me. Maybe that's 
the one thing thaI didn 't translate: 
well . 

DeathRay (Sacramento): This 
band features two members from 
the well-known band Cake. I had no 
idea that '70s-style industrial brit-
pop could come out of Sacramento. 

evertheless, the on-stage dancing 
won me over, along with the cht:l"sy 
love-song lyrics and easy sing-along 
factor. I never thought danCing 
could be so sexy. Well. I know that 
Beck Gill do it. but the organ player? 
AmaZing. They're a very entertalll-
ing bunch and sold out two shows 
during my stay in Austin. 

The Mr, T Experience (Berke-
ley): These guys have been around 
for a while. but they're starting to 
make public appearances again. To 
PUt it simply, they play "songs about 
chicks: and say so before each set. 
One of their best albums, "Love is 
Dead," is a tribute to sucky failed 
ant::mpts at love and relationships. 
This is the music we can all relate 
to. They are very poppy. ska-like, 
with lots of '60s rock 'n' roll back-
up vocals, but differ with the blunl 
binerness of rejection. Their come-
dy act and synchronized guitar 
swaying, similar to ZZ Top, is a 
show in itself and worth seeing. 
They use to play live all the time at 
Soma in San Diego, but since the 
13-year-old hangout closed last 
year, I haven't seen much of them 
around. 

Modest Mouse (Issaquah , 
Wash.): I've actually been following 
this band for the past three years, 
but this was the first time that I was 
able to see them live. It was one of 
the most unbelievable concert expe-
riences of my lifetime. Modest 
Mouse are 10 times more amazing 
in person than they are on any of 
their five albums. I had no idea that 
so many different noises could 
come out of the same three instru-
ments. Midway through the show, 
the lead singer lifted his guitar up to 
his mouth , where he used the pick-
up as a mlc to distort his voice. I was 
a little concerned when he pulled 
out a bag of live crawdads and hand-
ed them out 10 the people in the 
front row. I think Modest Mouse 
could quite possibly be one of the 
more ingenious groups out there 
now.

group crooned its collective love 
for all things meat and cheese -
probably much more enjoyable 
viewing than ·'NSync's HBO Spe-
cia I. " Area disc jockeys have 
recently flooded the company 
with requests for the Boys. in the 
flesh, as guests. The only inter-
view the band was willing to give 
took place on "founder" Jack's 
very own call-in radio show. an 
ongoing format for the chain's 
radio efforts. Although, if you find 
yourself in need of a beefy dairy 
fix - the official MeB Web site is 
offering MP3 downloads off the 
latest advertising campaign. It 's 
completely understandable why 
these five boys have such an 
attentive following - I became an 
instant fan after hearing the lyrics 
to their newest release, "The Ulti-
mate Cheese Burger (extended 
remix)": 

Girl, [know you're a vegetarian 
But [ won " eat tofu again 

, Give me the Ultimate Cheeseburg-
er 
I'm sure you'd understand 
It would be betur 
if you ate more li/ce a guy 
If lyrics like that don't make 

you want to throw your panties 
on stage. I don't know what 
would. But I'm almost positive 
that the site of these fabulous five 
will have your heart melting like a 
slice of cheese; and with songs 
titled: "Your Love's Melting Me, 
Baby" and "Put On Your Dancin' 
Meat," it's no coincidence that 
product sales have jumped 40 to 
SO percent since the campaign 
began. 

Hot and juicy boys singing 
about hot and juicy burgers - the 
world is not a perfect place.

an "absolute circus" 
CGIItI ..... rro. ..... 24 

Although I had solved to my 
satisfaction the controversy of 
whether this fight was pre-
arranged, at least in Golota 's 
mind, my real question was 
whether this fight should have 
taken place at all. My conclusion

of their hard-earned money, and 
the SpOrt of boxing out of its 
integrity. In the last five years, we 
have seen fights end because of 
people biting off others' ears. ran-
dom head-butts, boxers having 
nervous breakdowns in the mid-
dle of the ring and, in the case of 
Golota, simply quitting in the 
middle of the fight and delivering 
blows to his opponent's groin one 
too many times (which he did on 
two occasions, both times against 
Riddick Bowel. 

And who gets was a resounding 
no! 

These men are 
completely unsta-
ble, and their track 
records prove it. 
Golota has a histo-
ry of mental health 
problems and also 
has a problem 
keeping his punch-
es away from his 
opponents' geni-
tals. 

The most 
entertaining part of 
the match was 

screwed when this 
kind of garbage 
goes on in the 
ring? People like 
you and me. We 
'tune in and hope 
to see a real classic, 
like the first battle' 
between Holyfield 
and Tyson, but for 
e\(ery one of those 
there are 10 Tyson 
vs. Golota matches. 

Tyson's prob-
lems have been 
well-docu mented 

seeing Golota 
walking down the 
path to the locker 
room, all the while 
being pelted by beers 
from disgusted fans. I have . seen 

enough of these 

and range from something as sim-
ple as asocial behavior to some-
thing as serious as rape. Clearly. 
these people are not in the right 
physical and mental state of well-
being to put themselves in the mid-
dle of a rlOg punching the tar out of 
each other. But who in his right 
mind would do that anyway? 

Heavyweight boxing has 
become an absolute circus. This 
fight encompassed everything bad 
about the sport. Tyson received 
$10 million , while Golota received 
$2 million for six minutes of 
work. 

Like many of the marquee 
heavyweight boxing matches of 
recent years, this one ended with 
some completely unexpected 
freak occurrence. It gypped the 
people who paid for the fight ou t 

episodes that I will 
never again pay one red cent to 
watch this crap. [ can do many 
things with $50 that would be 
much more fulfilling than watching 
two social deviants dance around 
and beat on each other for five 
minutes before one of them gets 
sick of it and does something that 
ends up getting him disqualified . 
There is also a much better way to 
use my time than to watch an 
entire undercard of fighters that I 
have never heard of waiting for the 
big match-up to arrive, only to be 
thoroughly disappointed once it 
does. 

So, for those of you who are 
loyal, "Reality Check" readers, add 
heavyweight boxing to NBA bas-
ketball on the list of garbage sports 
that this writer will never again 
become interested in .

Women's Soccer Clinches 
a Playoff Berth WIth Win 
4-0 romp over Grand Canyon ensures 
CCAA postseason trip for the Tritons 
If IICJaRr FULJON 
Sports Editor 

Coming into this year, many 
questioned whether UCSD ath-
letics would be able to compete 
with the new Division II competi-
tion our teams would be facing. 

The Triton women's soccer 
team has answered that question 
with a definitive "yes." 

With two big wins this week 
against Grand Canyon University 
and California State University 
San Bernardino, the Tritons made 
big suiveS toward excellency. 

The women's soccer team 
clinched a berth in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championship Tournament after 
a 4-0 stomping of the Grand 
Canyon Antelopes on the road 
Friday. 

Erika Alfredson was on a tear 
again, scoring two goals on six 
~nots. She also had an assist. 

Cindy Dostalek and Elizabeth 
Hughes each added a goal and 
Christy Abizaid contributed with 
two assists. 

Triton goalkeeper Kami Poma 
had one save in 70 minutes of 
work and Carolyn Cadei had four 
in the remaining 20 minutes of 
play. 

After the playoff-clinching 
victory, the Thtons headed home 
for a huge match against San 
Bernardino. 

Earlier this season, the .two 
teams had gotten together to 
rumble in San Bernardino, and 
UCSD suffered one of its two 
losses during their first ever 
CCM match, losing 4-2. 

This time around, the Coyotes 
were no match for UCSD as the 
Thtons trounced the visitors 3-2. 

", just think we've matured 
since that time with nine first-
year players," said Thton head 
coach Brian McManus. "The first 
game of the season we weren't 
quite ready. I think as the season's 
gone on we've gotten a lot better 
and a lot tougher." 

The Thtons received their 
goals from a uifecta of players. 
Alfredson was up to her old uicks 
with the team's first goal off a 
Hughes assist. 

Jessica Cordova got in on the 
fun after a Dostalek assist opened 
her up for another 1Hton go.al. 

Julia Cuder rounded out the 
scoring with a shot off of an 
Abizaid assist. 

Poma was rarely tested, need-
ing to make only two Saves. 

Next up for UCSD is a pivotal 
contest against Cal Poly Pomona, 
which shares with UCSD a posi-
tion atop the CCAA Southern 
Division standings. The Tritons. 
who downed Cal Poly 1-0 in 
overtime this year, will win the 
South with a victory. 

"We're just going game to 
game, taking it as it comes," 
McManus said. "We've got a big 
game to sec who wins the South. 
We're a first-year squad. The con-
ference has proved it's tough. It's 
going to be a tight game; a very, 
very tight game. We'll just iake it 
from there." 

The Tritons. who now stand at 
11-2 in CCM play and 13-2 
overall, will head to Pomona on 
Friday for a match at 4:30 p.m.

UCSD Streaks Past 
San Francisco State 
The Tritons' volleyball team comes through 
.with ~ three-game sweep on the roady 

Staff Writer 

No, those were not overeager 
witches breaking out their broom-
sticks for a quick pre-Halloween 
jaunt that you may have seen 
Friday night in San Francisco. 

Those were simply members of. 
the UCSD women's volleyball team 
grabbing a dominating sweep of 
San Francisco State in SFSU's own 
arena, appropriately titled The 
Swamp. 

The play of San Francisco State 
looked like something that 
belonged submerged in the goopy 
detritus of some dank bog some-
where, at least in contrast to the 
superb play of UCSD. 

The three-game sweep showed 
the Tritons in solid form; they exe-
cuted their plays cleanly and made 
few mistakes after the first game. 

Early on was a slightly different 
story, however, as the Thtons were 
still probably thinking of the late-
night, five-game shocker they 
pulled out against Sonoma State 
on Friday. The first game went to 
extra points to squeak past SFSY 
16-14. 

Once the cobwebs cleared, 
however, it was 1Htons, Thtons, 
and more Thtons for the remainder 
of the match. The team gathered a 
collective second wind and went on 
to take the final two games in a 
steadfast and decisive fashion, with 
scores of 15-4 and 15-6 to collect 
the sweep and the all-important 
Colle$iate Conference Athletic 
AsSOCIation win. 

Leslie Punelli led the way for 
the Tritons with her 12 kills and 18 
digs, while teammates Kathleen 
Hentz and Dianne Camarillo also 
stood out among the bolstered 
UCSD attack, both with at least ten 
kills apiece. 

These three players continue 
to dominate as they have all sea-
son, and alongside players like 
Laura Santerre and Jennie 
Wilson, they form the core of the 
Tritons' winning formula and 
keep head coach Duncan 
McFarland smiling. 

With this win the Tritons 
improve their glowing record to a 
stellar 19-4 overall, with 13-2 tally 
in conference play. 

The lowly San Francisco squad 
fell to 3-15 in league and 1-14 
overall. 

The Tritons have another big 
weekend ahead of them as they will 
once again face off in two huge 
divisional games, thi~ . time against 
Cal State Stanislaus on Friday at 7 
p.m. and Cal State Bakersfield on 
Saturday at 8 p.m. 

This two-game series marks the 
return of our beloved Tritons to 
our very own RlMAC Arena after 
two consecutive weekends on the 
road. 

Come out and support our 
squad as both of these opponents 
are fierce Tri ton rivals and will 
surely be gunning for them this 
time around after earlier losses. 
The white-hot Tritons will hope-
fully con~nue their victorious ways 
and you should be there to see it all 
go down.

Soccer: 
Big matches up ahead 
for the Tritons 
ContI.eeI front ..... 24 
showdown with UCSD on 
Monday, JUSt before the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championships 
begin. 

When asked how the Tritons 
would approach facing teams as 
CSU Dominguez Hills and 
Sonoma State - the only teams 
to defeat the Tritons this year -
the response was clear: revenge. 

"Revenge would definitely 
be nice against Dominguez 
Hills and Sonoma," Cookson 
said. "Who doesn't want anoth-
er shot at Dominguez Hills? 
They're definitely a great team 
and I'd really like a chance to 
play them again. From here on 
out all that matters is the next 
game. We can't get ahead of 
ourselves." 

A similar response was given 
to the question of teamwork. 
The amount of unity this learn 
has is quite evident. 

"( think we have had success 
in the past month because we 
play for each other," Summers 
said. "There are no players on 
the team who think only of 
themselves. Our team is very 
close and we have learned to play 
well with each other. · 

The next two matches will be 
a test how the Tritons fill the hole 
Mizumoto filled up so well. The 
team has bounced back from two 
major injuries this year, so adver-
sity is its oyster. 

"We look forward to going 
against the best the conference 
has to offer this next week,· 
Armstrong said. "We, however, 
have two games to find out 
what we can do to fill Ryan 's

Tyson-Golota 
Fight a Mere 
Joke 

Bill BURGER 
don't know how many of you 

I decided to fork out the exorbi-tant sum that it took to pur-c e a viewing of the Mike Tyson 
vs. Andrew Golota fight on Friday 
night, but my roommates and I 
were unfortunately among your 
ranks. What we saw was the poor-
est excuse for a heavyweight fight 
since Tyson decided to give 
Evander Holyfield some free plastic 
surgery almost three-and-a-half 
years ago. 

For those of you who haven't 
heard, here 's what happened. 
Tyson tagged Golota in the first 
round and knocked him down. The 
second round was pretty much a 
waste. Before the third round could 
even begin, Golota quit and walked 
out of the ring. 

The most entertaining part of 
the match was seeing Golota walk-
ing down the path to the locker 
room, all the while being pelted by 
beers from disgusted fans. 

In my house there were about 
30 angry people yelling obscenities 
at the television, my girlfriend and 
me included. We were all thor-
oughly pissed about the outcome, 
and we pretty much assumed that 
we had been duped into tuning 
into a fight that was fixed from the 
beginning. But later we heard some 
information that made us all feel 
like we belonged in Satan's con-
stituency. 

It turns out that Golota not only 
suffered a concussion from his 
two-round brawl with Tyson, but 
he also received a broken cheek-
bone. Feeling bad, I began to think 
about whether we, as fans, have the 
right to expect people to fight to 
the brutal end against allimals like 
Tyson. 

First of all, I considered whether 
our assessment that the fight was 
rigged was accurate. After doing 
quite a bit of thinking, I came to 
the conclusion that Golota didn 't 
go into the fight looking to take a 

div~,:" 
~y evidence is twofold. First of 

all, in the interview after the fight, 
Golota looked greatly distraught 
about the occurrences during the 
six minutes of fighting. It was clear-
ly not the look of a man who had 
come to Michigan looking for a 
quick eayday. 

Second of all, and more impor-
tantly, I figured if Golota wanted a 
quick score, he could have had it 
much faster. Tyson absolutely 
demolished him with a knockout 
blow at the end of the first round. 
Golota staggered and then hit the 
mat. 

If this man wanted to take the 
money and run, there is no way he 
would have got up from this shot. 
He would have meekly stayed sit-
ting on the canvas, counting his 
millions as the referee quickly 
counted him out. But Golota didn't 
do that. He got up and stood in 
with Tyson for another round 
before quitting, taking unbelievable 
punishment t~at he could have 
easily avoided if he wasn't looking 
to win.

Triton Weekend Is a Letdown 
Pacing some fierce competition, UCSD finishes eighth at NorCal tourney 
ByTAIT MIWR 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Tritons went 1-3 in last 
weekend's NorCal Water Polo 
Tournament, beating Air Force 
12-9 and losing to UC Berkeley 9-
6, Pepperdine 10-5 and Long 
Beach State 5-2. 

In the two-day tournament, 
which ran on Oct. 21-0ct. 22, 
UCSD drew Air Force first. 

Although Air Force has not 
been nationally ranked this year, it 
is still a very good team and came 
out swarming in the first quarter, 
staking a 2-0 lead when time had 
expired. 

UCSD could have clammed up 
at this point. All season long the 
Tritons have come out and been 
able to stick it to people in the first 
quarter and establish themselves, 
but for the last couple of games at 
UCSB and Long Beach State, they 
have no! been able to do this. 

Falling behind early again 
could have disheartened the I 
Tritons. However, UCSD did not 
let the early score affect it and 
stormed out in the second quarter, 
attacking Air Force up and down 
the pool, scoring four goals . . 

"We did not let getting down 
early affect us, ,even though it is 
something we have been having 
problems with ," said head coach 
Denny Harper. 

DavIa Pill/ GuardIan 

Above ... beyond: Tiiton jason Boettner; wlw has logged 29 goals and 23 assists this season, rises to the occasion. 

UCSD let its guard down a lit-
tle on the defensive end and 
allowed two goals. The second 
quarter ended tied, 4-4. 

Looking to up the pressure, the 
Tritons decided to keep attacking 
the Air Force defense and came 
out for the third quarter in a feed-
ing frenzy. 

Air Force was not to be intimi-
dated however, and in a rabid, dog 
fight-like, offensively charged 
third quarter, reminiscent of the 
Rams-Chiefs game, the Tritons 
scored six·goals to Air Force's five. 

By the end of the fourth quar-
ter UCSD had slogged its way to 
two more goals and the defense 
had held Air Force to a big fat 

bagel to make the final score 12-9, 
Tritons. 

"Even though we were down 
early we weren't ever afraid of los-
ing the game. we knew we could 
win: Harper said. 

Jonathan Samuels scored four 
goals for UCSD and Vladimir 
Djapic and Justin Wylie added two 
goals apiece. 

The tournament had 16 teams 
competing and because only two 
pools were available, UCSD was 
forced to play its second game a 
scant three hours after their first. 

Unluckily for the Thtons, its 
second game was against Cal, a 
team who, even at full strength, 
the Tritons would be hard pressed 
to handle. 

To complicate matters further, 

Cal was out for blood, as earlier in 
the season UCSD had defeated 
them for the first time in years 
and knocked them out of the top 
ranking. 

The game started out slowly 
and evenly with UCSD hanging 
tough , and Cal went into the sec-
ond quarter with only a 3-2 lead, It 
looked like a rematch of earlier in 
the season, but then Cal took over, 
outstripping UCSD to take a 6-2 
halftime lead. 

The Tritons fought valiantly in 
the second half, narrowing the gap 
to 7-5, but in the end Cal was too 
much for them and they fell, 9-6 . 

"This was our best game of the 
weekend: Harper said. "We were 
really happy with the way we 
played in this game, even though 

we did not win." 
Samuels posted three more 

goals for the Tritons. 
Tne second day UCSD had a 

chance to place as high as fifth in 
the tournament, but an early 
morning loss to Pepperdine made 
it impossible for it to place any 
higher than seventh, and with its 
mid-day loss to Long Beach State, 
UCSD ended up placing eighth. 

Despite its disappointing 
showing at the tournament, 
UCSD has something to look for-
ward to because the next couple of 
weeks it will play five home games. 
This will give the Tritons time to 
regroup for a season-ending push 
toward championships. 

This Sunday the Tritons face 
Clairemont College at 12 p.m.

With the playoffs weeks away, 
The UCSD men's soccer team 
helped its cause by defeating rival 
California State University San 
Bernardino 2-0. 

The victory improved the 
Thtons' season record to 11-2-2, 9-
2-2 in conference play. 

Junior Daniel Appel scored an 
early goal and freshman Jonathan 
Costabile scored later on to seal the 
win for the Thtons, who imprqved 
their unbeaten streak to eight gaines. 

"We got a quick goal early on 
that helped to set the pace of the 
game: tTeshinan goalkeeper Jeremy 
Cookson said. "This time they came 
out very tough and it took us a while 
to start stringing things together: 

The victory, however, was marred 
by the knee injury of Ryan 
Mizumoto, one of the top midtield-
ers the Thtons have in their lineup. 
He will miss the remainder of the 
season. 

"Ryan's injury is a major one and 

a major blow to the team," said head 
coach Derek Armstrong. "He was 
the unity that kept everything going, 
and we will sorely miss him: 

Freshman Sean Summers also 
commented that with Mizumoto out 
of the lineup, someone will have to 
step up and play well in the midfield. 

"When Ryan was taken out of 
the game we struggled to find our 
rhythm." Summers said. "After half-
time we came out hard and put the 
game away early. After that, they 
were done and we were able to 
experiment a little." 

As for the rest of the season, the 
men's soccer team has an away game 
with Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 27. 
The last match against Pomona 
ended in a thrilling overtime goal by 
Tyler Girimonte to lift the Thtons to 
victory. 

After that comes a UCSD alum-
ni match; the time of which has yet 
to be announced. United States 
International University comes to 
town for a final non conference
