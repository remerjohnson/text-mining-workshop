ANN ARBOR, Mich . -
The residence hall room of 
an African American student 
at Kalamazoo College was 
destroyed by a fire on ept. 
28 . School officials said 
they suspect arson . Officials 
also believe that the act was 
promoted by a poetry read-
ing that the ~tudent gave 
durin g the ~choo l 's orienta-
tion la~t month . He read an 
original pocm that stressed 
the importance of j udging 
an individual on the conten t 
of the ll· character and not 
theIr sJ.. in color. The day 
hefore lh.e fire , a letter was 
posted on the African 
American student 's door 
staling that all non-white 
students should be eliminat-
ed from the campus. Nei ther 
the studcnt nor his 
Caucasian roommate was 
present in the room at the 
time of the blaze . The 
school is offering a $1,000 
reward for information lead-
ing to the identification of 
anyone responsible for the 
crime.

Fire Sparks Desire 
For Sprinklers 
BOWLING GREEN , Ky -
After a deadly residence hall 
fire at Western Kentucky 
University (WKU), 
Kentucky Governor Paul 
Pall on 's administration has 
asked WKU as well as other 
universiti es in Kentucky to 
provide cost estimates for 
installing sprinkler systems 
in all residence halls. 
Despite the state fire mar-
shal's order that WKU 
install fire sprinklers in all 
the dormitories , only four 
residence halls currently 
have them. State officials 
are especiall y interested in 
WKU's dormitories because 
of their height. urrently, 
fire rescue equipment such 
as r scue ladders, cannot 
reach the top 1100rs, leaving 
students without an outside 
escape route.

Under the Sea Bike Thefts

Dramatically 
POLICE: Forty-two bicycles 
have been stolen on campu 
since July 1, J 998 
By Eleanor Kay 
Guardian Reporter 

Students need to be more careful than 
ever when locking up their bikes as an 
unusual number of bicycle theft s have been 
reported to the UCSD Police Department 
since July 1, 1998. 

UCSD Police Ofliccr Alan Jenkins said 
that 42 bicycles have becn stolen in the last 
three months.

"I can't remember a time where there has

time, and I've been working at UCSD for 13 
years," Jenkins said.

BOARD: Two 
undergrads selected 
as chair, vice-chair 
By Elaine M. Wong 
Guardian Reporter 

The University of California 
Student Association (UCSA), a 
UC student advocacy group, 
rccently elected Kami 
Chisholm as the chair of its 
Board of Directors. In addition, 
Haady Lashkari was chosen for 
the position of vice-chair. Each 
of their terms lasts one year. 

A.S. Vice Pres ident 
Ex ternal Kirk Matsuzaki said 
that the phi losophy of the 

CSA is to provide students 
with access to education . 
Mat uzaki is the chair of 
UCSA's Executive Committee 
of Affirmative Action. 

The organization develops 
an agenda of items to campaign 
in favor of each year. The 
UCSA will write thi s year's 
agenda at their meetings on 
Oct. 9 to Ocl. II at UC Santa 
Cruz. Since UCSA is the offi -
cially recognized voice of the 
students before the UC Regents 
and meets the weekend before 
each regent 's meeting. 

"We are the recognized voice 
to the [UC] Regents," 
Matsuzaki said. "We are the 
official voice of the UC stu-
dents." 

Cbisholm, the newly elected 
chair of UCSA, is the 
·pokesperson for the entirc 
organization. She said her 
responsibility is to take carc of 
day-to-day operations and to 
speak on behalf of all UC stu-
dents. 

"I am ~he representative and 
the liai son to the ex ternal 
groups, such as the State 
Legislature," Chisholm said. 

Lashkari 's responsibility as 
vice-chair includes overseeing 
the staff operations. He is also 
the supervisor of personnel. 

"I really work to open com-
munication and good working 
conditions amongst the person-
nel," Lashkari said. 

Chisholm and Lashkari 
were running mates during the 
elections. Their platform 
involved three main points -
making the board a lively and 
productive organizati on, advo-
cati ng grass roots lobbying, and 
being accountable and visible 
to tbe UC students. 

"Haady and I rea lly wanted 
to work together because we 

See STUDENTS, Page 3 

"The problem we have is that we don ' t 
have enough per onnel to track each area 
and really catch the thief in action ," Jenkins 
said. "Generally, the bikes are being stolen 
all over campus with a concentration in the 
Geisel Library and Center Hall area." 

Jenkins also said it is difficult to invesit-
gate crimes committed during school hours. 

"There are many other places where it's 
happening, and it's happening in broad day-
light between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 
p.m.," Jenkins said. "We' re continuing to do 
what we ' re doing, but it 's not fruitful 
because our personnel is limited." 

Approximately 120 bicycles have been 
stolen so far in 1998. This number is larger 
than the 106 bicycles that were stolen for all 
of 1997. 

The police have put together an inves-
tigative team to follow and pursue the bike 
thefts. As a part of its cfforts to catch the 
person or persons responsible for the crimes, 
the investigative team have used such tech-
niques as selling up and monitoring "bait

Humans Lack Enzyme 
RND: Researcher find that humans have a mutant 
gene which differentiates them from other species 
By Marjorie Montemayor

Researchers have di ~covered 
the reason behind a slructu ral dif-
ference in a molecule local cd on

The variation results 
from a 
mutation 

geneti c 
that 

excludes a specific 
enl.ymati c activity 
from occurring in 
humans, hut not in

may be a possible 
key in explaining 
the physiological 
and morphological 
differences between 
humans and apes.

revealed by a group 
of scientists headed

an array of animals 
and unvei led find -
ings conlirming that 

euSGc is present

animal cells studied 
except humans. 

The research 
team then investi -

" We looked at

UCSD )s religiOUS groups, though o./ien

By Shannon Castle 
Contributing Opmion Writer 

On any given night thi s wl:ek. one can find 
several dilferent groups 01 ,tuden\s meeting to 
pray. sing. talk and just h'lng out. Thesl: students 
have discovered one of the hcSl things ahout 
UCSIJ: Its religious w lllmunity, comprised of 
the 30 regi ste rcd religious organil<ltions on cam-
pus. 

While over half of thc.,c cluhs arc hri stian-
hased. Muslims. Jews. nitarians and sevl:ra l 
othel religious denominations join the ranh. 
Although many peopll: fai I to sec the allral:tion 
of rel igious groups. opting instl:ad \0 focus on 
sl:cular 'Ktivlti.:s and organiJations, the large 
number of rt:ligious org'lIlil.ations. alld thl: even 
greater numher of ~tudcnts involved in them, 
shows that religious organi/.ations I1cnefit many 
studenl!; at UCSD. 

These duhs provide ,Ill env ironillent where 
students can I!row in their faith . k:arn more ahout 
thelll,e1ves and meet pcopll: with ~ llllilar vicws 
ahout IiI'\.!. 

Several groups. Induding Int ervar~ it y 
Chmtian Fc lluwship (I CF) and ampus

ferent races. Thl: sharcd laith of the lnel1lhcr~ of 
thes!.! groups providc~ the hasi~ for sol vi ng proh-
kms such as racial tension and interpersonal

parlio.:ul ar l:u llural group. SUdl as A~ian Ameril:an 

hristian Fl: llowship (AA 'F) or Korean 
American hristian Fellowship (KACF). allow 
mcmhers to diso.:u~s partil:ular cultural issue, in 
the context of their re ligion. 

Campus-based religious organil.ations are not 
onl y open to those who share the group's rai th , 

hut also to athei sts and people seek ing to learn 
more ahout a religion other than thl: ir own . Most 

CSD relrgious groups an; vcr opcn to new 
ml:mhers. whether they are sel:king n.: lrgion or 
simply visiting out of curiosi ty. Even people very 
devoted tll a particular faith can enjoy learning 
ahout other religions. 

"I don ' t mind hei ng approached by people of 
nthl:r religions." said Daisy Kim, a Chri stian and 
a member of Campus Cnrsade for Chri s\. "I want 
to learn about other religions and I would want 
thl:1ll to treat my religion with the same rl:spcct 
that I give th!.!irs." 

To enwuragl.! student intere~t in thclr orga-
ni/atinns. religious duhs puhli si/.e their out-

Unfortunately, the biggest and most CO Ill-

utilize posters. informational tahles and 
othl:r displa ys to inlroduce themsl:lv..:s to

For ,tudents not involved in

nouting around that fral ernity amI 
sorority mcmbers arc of .\ l!crlain 
similar mentality. This just isn 't 
trU l:. At least , not all the time. 

Like with any group, when the

Any group of people whose 
primary function and goal 
(min r philanthropy aside) is 
to bcnent itself is by delinition 

just get the opportunity to achieve 
"enlightenment" more often. 

The nature or sororities and 
rraternities is primarily sOl:ial. 
t hough some are hased on al:adc-
mics. religion or l:thnicity. 
Exc luding the fraterni ties and 
soro riti es that arc trul y hased on 
scrvice. religion or l:thnicity. th~~e 
groups arc rat her shallow. As 
sOl:ia l groups following tradition , 
sororities and frat l:rni ties tend to 
look for their "own kind ." This. of 
ClIurse. is the only way to contin-
ue tradition without l:hange. 

Group attitudl:s arise morc 
quickly when the individuals of a 
particular group, including frater-
niti e~ and sororities, only look for 
their own kind. What non-mem-
hers seem to think is that members 
of fraternities and sororities only 
look for mirror images. This also 
is not always true. A reason Illany 
memhers of these organizations 

scl lish and conl!eited. This is 
not to say that as singular. sclf-
thinking individuals, fraternity and 
sorority meml1crs have these same 
traits. 

Another gripe expressed hy 
non-memhers is that these typcs of 
groups havc a certain wc' re-ht:t -

you've ever been with a group of

6 OPINION 

EXPLOIT: 
Group target 
students in crisi 
Continu. from ... g. 4 
informati on and hi gh-pressure, 
dangerous recruiting has heen 
crossed. Predictabl y, a IOl of stu -
dents find this approach excessive-
ly aggressive and territoria l. 

Tomas Johnson, a fourth-year 
Urban Studies student, labels th is 
kind of recruiting as "an in vasion 
of privacy." 

"I have been approached four 
different times by the same 
recruiter," Johnson said. "I feel 
they should have more respect for 
other people's heliefs," 

There are numerous other 
instances of high-pressure religious 
recru iting on the UCSD campus. 
These incidents tend to occur when 
religious groups (affiliated or non-
affiliated with UCSD) comhine 
psychology and aggressive recruit-
ing in order to ex ploit the emotion-
al vulnerability of students who 
have not succeeded in deli ning a 
sati sfactory social niche. 

An informillional pamphlet pub-
lished by the UCSD Office of 
Religious Affairs stated that high-
pressure groups target students who 
find themselves in moments of cri -
sis . These probl.ems range any-
where fro m grieving and homesick-
ness to a poor social life and lack of 
adequate academic progress. 

The pamphlet stated that in 

order distinguish between high- and 
low-pressure re li gious recru itment, 
students should pay cI se attention 
to patterns of behavior present 
wi thin the infrastructure of the 
group. uch pallems might include 
the claim that the group "has all the 
right answers" or a tendency toward 
as king new memhers to start 
rec ruiting. Meanwhile, personal 
doubts and questions are regarded 
as unsubstantiated and indicati ve of 
precari ous, shaky fa ith . The 
recruit's previous religious am lia-
t ion is percei ved as ridiculous and 
may he openly labe led as such. 

The most evident danger of 
high-pressure groups is the fact that 
they tend to focus on reinforcing 
fee lings or guilt or shame. Instead 
of allev iating a si tuation of crisis, 
they promote it. 

Thc second, less ohvious reason 
high-pressure religious organi za-
tions can be detrimental has a lot to 
do wi th the nature of their recruiting 
tac tics. These tactics are aggressi ve, 
yet prac ticed politely and charm-
ingly. Although some students feel 
violated when approached on their 
way to class or (worse yet) in their 
dorm rooms. they Ii nd it di fli cult to 
avoid engag ing in a conversation 
with the recruiter. 

Rabbi Lisa Go ldstein from 
UCS D's Oflice of Reli gious Alfai r~ 
agrees that ~llIdenh do complai n of 
feeling trapped in lengthy w nver-
sations wilh aggress ive re l igiou~

but I am not interested' and walk 
away. You don't owe them any-
thing." 

Goldstein roughly estimates that 
students compla in of high-pressure 
re ligious recrui tment at a rate of 
once a week . 

"Complaints do happen," 
Goldstei n said. "Quite often." 

If the context were different, 
and remale students complained of 
pressure from sexuall y aggressive 
male raculty on a weekly basis, the 
problem would likely be labeled as 
having reached epidemic propor-
tions. 

In the contex t of religious 
recruitment , the uni ve rsi ty is 
pl aced between two delicate and 
eq uall y i mp0rl '!fl t constitutional 
issues - the right to free speech 
and religion (of groups as we ll as 
st udents) and the separation of 
church and state. Consequently, the 
nondenominati onal Offi ce or 
Religious Affairs was created on 
campus in order to oller counse ling 
on religious issues. 

The memhers of thi s oflicc rep-
resent a wide spectrum of religious 
tradi tions including 1cwish, Roman 
Catholic, Lutheran , Presbyterian, 
Methodist, Episcopali an and 
Bapti st. The purpose for the ex is-
tence of the Offi ce of Religious 
AITai rs on the UCSD campus is to 
provide re ligious resources and to 
he lp people connect. 

It is undear from where the 
funding fo r the reli gious groups on 
cam[lus comcs. Apparently, Illost of 

Monday, October 5, 1998 

the funding comes fro m either pri-
yate organizations or rromthe activ-
ity fec that is tacked on to each stu-
dent 's quarterly fees. Yes, we do pay 
for religious activit ies on campus. 

Last quaner, the Student 
Organization Fund ing Allocation 
Board (SOFAB ), which receives a 
portion of student fees, funded 
Campus Crusade for Christ , 
Intervarsity Christi an Fellowship 
and other re ligion-based student 
organizations. According to Pat Ru , 
vice president of finance, spon-
sored events li sted hy SOFAB 
range from speakers and bands to 
racial reconciliation workshops and 
ak ohol awareness. 

"Bes ides these general events, 
there are none that li st 'recruit-
ment ,'" Ru sa id . "[We J are not 
aware of any incidents where funds 
have been used to recruit students." 

In any case, neither the booths, 
the advertising of God on Library 
Walk nor the pizza arc aggressive 
and intrusive. (Still , is there any-
th ing such as ca lorie-free prayer 
anymore'?) It is uncertain why reli-
gious groups have not managed to 
make more creative use of their 
time and money, other th ,m stand-
ing around on Library Walk di strib-
uti ng food and information to peo-
ple who are already well fed and 
buy $1,400 worth of knowledge 
every quarter. 

What I do mind is when re li-
gious groups leave their booths and 
try to sell themselves to me. I just 
won ' t buy it.

open and available to students." 

Students are d early responding 
to these outreach elforts , The UCSD 
religious groups are not small or 
insignificant. An IVCF poster pro-
claims that it is the "second largest 
student organization on campus," 
surpassed only by R1SC, the cam-
pus ski and snowboarding club. The 
growth of religious organizations 
can only be allributed to their open-
ness to the UCSD community ; peo-
ple feel welcomed and accepted 
within these organizations. 

"lr the Lord has open arms for 
everyone, than how could an orga-
ni zation that studies hi s word be 
any different'!" said Brandon 
Lithgoe, a Revelle sophomore. 
Lithgoe is not alone in his beliefs. 
Many others lind that campus reli -
gious groups are willing to take 
them in, whether they stay for four 
minutes or four years. 

Students often voice the fear 
that religious organizations engage 
in "cult rituals" and "hrainwash-
ing." This is a legitimate com:ern. 

The student body's 
general Ignorance of 
the variety of 
religious groups on 
campus, and the 
ethnic diversity 
within them, 'causes 
stereotyping of the 
religious community. 
Instead of making 
themselves aware 
of the different 
groups on campus, 
people often Judge 
the .. organizations 
by Individual 
members. 
but only outside of the safety net of 
registered student organ izati ons. 
The 30 reli gious clubs that are reg-
istered with Student Organizati ons 
and Leadership Opportunities 
(SOLO) are subject to the same 
standards of conduct as all other 
registered clubs on campus. 

Beware, however, of any unreg-
istered groups. If you have any 
doubts or questions about the legit-
imacy of a particular organization, 
conta~t the SOLO of/i ce or the 
Ortice of Religious Afrairs. 

Too often, though, it is neither 
the publicity nor the fear of cults 
that scares students away from reli-
gious organizations, but rather the 
mi sconcept ions they hold ahout 
UCSD's community of faith . 

"There's nothing to do on this 
campus unless you' re Asian or 

The UC D Guardian 

Christi an," joked Brad Rosenhlutt , 
a second-year Re elle student and 
a se lf-proclaimed hedonist. " 11' 
you're hoth. you' re s<: I." 

The student hody\' general 
ignorance of the v;lriety of rc li-
gious groups on campus. and the 
ethnic diversi ty wi th in them, caus-
es stereotyping of the rdig-inus 
l:Olllmunity. lns tl!ud of maki ng 
themselves aware of the di Ilerem 
groups on campus, people often 
judge these organi za tions hy indi-
vidual members. Orten, a studem's 
onl y exposure to a religious group 
is one over-zealous, offensive 
member. As the majority of the 
people involved in religious orga-
ni zations are not of the stereotypi -
ca l, "evangeli sti c" vari ety, it is 
important to check out the group as 
a whole. People are not perfect, and 
no one can accurately represent an 
entire group. 

With the new quarter just begin-
ning, now is a great time to tryout 
a religious group. The university 
exi sts as a forum for di fferent ideas 
and viewpoints. Very rarely are so 
many religions represented in a sin-
gle place. Students establi shed in a 
raith can lind a peer group that will 
uphOld them in their convictions. 
Others can ex plore a wide variety 
of doctrines within the safety of a 
publie university, where "brain-
washing" and the like are strictly 
off-limits. Everyone can meet new 
people. make new fri ends and have 
some fun . The UCSD religious 
organi zations are, at the very least, 
worth looking into.

pus relig ious organi zations contact

tered, making it more diflicult to 
recover and return a stolen bicycle.

owner of a found bicycle, students 
should have their bikes regi stered 
with the police and SD trans-
portation services.

CRIME: Even 
locked bikes are 
targeted by thieves 
Continued from paCe 9 
10 with u-Iocks, one wi th a 
chai n lock and three were unse-
cured. 

Jenkins said even the most 
expensive lock cannot guarantee 
safety. However. he said any 
lock will at least help to deter 
against a possihle theft. 

In an e-mail sent to students 
on Friday, UCSD Police Chief 

Maudie Bobbill asked students 
to he aware of any suspicious 
ac ti vi ties of persons in and 
around the areas where bicycles 
are parked. Additionally, she 
offered suggestions for students 
on how to prevent the theft of 
their bicycle and asked for stu-
dents to report bike theft as soon 
as possible. 

"If your bicycle is stolen, 
please report it." Bobbill staled 
in her email. "The information 
you provide ahout your loss 
helps us determine pallems in 
the thief 's behavior. The more 

The UCSD Guardian 

information we have, the better 
our chances are of catching the 
thief." 

Jenkins said that despite the 
trend of increasing bicycle thefts 
in ret:ent weeks, bike theft has 
never been a major problem at 
UCSD. The num ber of bikes 
stolen has steadily gone down 

s in~e 1993, and last year only 
106 hi t:ycles were stolen on 
t:ampus.

working to help Latin American street children who sniff glue.

age 13, sat with 
other street chi Idren

M arch 4, 1990

g lue over their heads. According to 
Amnesty International , Carmona resisted 
arrest and was subsequentl y thrown to 
the ground by one of the po licemen, 
ki cked in the stomach and left for dead. 

There are between 1,500 and 5,000 
street chi Idren living in Guatemala, 
according to a 1997 Human Rights 
Watch report. Casa A lianza is an organi -
zation dedicated to helping Latin Ameri -
can chi Idren escape from the streets. 

According to Casa Alianza, lhe wide-

spread poverty in Latin America makes 
prevention programs nearly impossihle. 
Instead, the organization, a branch of the 
New York·based Covenant HOllse, 
reaches out to the children who are 
already on the street. They o fler free 
shelter, medical advice and drug rehabi I-
itation services for the street children_ 

Cas a Alianza tells its volunteers that 
llv>_ most they can o ffer is a toy, some 
medical 1uention and a little affection. 
Driven to nO. Street. 

According to La",. Alianza, over 70 
percent of the populati on;., Guatemala 
and Honduras is so poor that tilt. ~eop le 
cannot even meet their most basic nce 
of food and shelter. They li ve in the colo· 
nias, shantytowns that crowd the peri ph· . 
ery of every major c ity. 

" Physical , emoti onal, and sexual 
abuse are the most common reasons chil · 

dren leave thei r ramilies," a Casa Alian-
za worker said_ "Some psychologists 
view th e children who fake to the streets 
as adapting functionally to otherwise 
unworkable situations." 
The Price of Survival 

Regardless or the circumstances that 
force children into the streets, they have 
few options once they arrive_ Steal and 
scavenge, prostitute themselves, or die. 

In an interview with Reuters, 18-year-
old M ari a Aguilar describes sifting 
th rough the dump to find food. 

'" grew up in the dump because I did· 
n' t want to sell my body, he said. 'The

LISA HUFF I 
Associate Photo Editor 

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Getting involved allows students to decide their own social fate 

In sitting down to write this 1.:01-
umn, I wracked my brain to find a 
suitable rant for the new school 
year, only to discover that nothing 
about UCSD bothered me enough 
to be a worthy topic. I suppose I 
could always fall back on some of 
UCSD's most popular criticisms, 
such as our campus is apathetic, or 
that La Jolla was ahout the worst 
place to put a university or that the 
majors offered by UCSD are limit-
ing my education. Needless to say, 
the list goes on. 

One of the first observations I 
made when I arrived on thi s cam-
pus three years ago was that a large 
number of students at UCSD were 
unhappy. I noticed quickly that 
many people did not share my 
enthusiasm for being hcre . Instead, 
they spoke skeptically of their 
impending college careers. Loom-
ing over the dorms was a warning 
from continuing students: Escape 
UCSD whi le you still can. I wit-
nessed just how contagious this 
all itude was, watching it quickly 
become a common element in daily 
conversation. 

Now, as I enter my fourth year 
at UCSD, I am sickened (although 
far from ,surprised) to see that my 

in itial observation has still not 
changed. I still hear the ceaseless 
whining of my fellow students, as 
they swear how happy they would 
be were they somewhere else. I lis-
ten in disbelief as they blame the 
(fill in the blank with your prob-
lem) of UCSD for taking away 
from their college experience. It 
takes all my strength in these situa-
tions to hold back a rude remark 
and simply walk away shaking my 
head. 

To those of you who fall into 
this ailing segment of the student 
body, I wonder if you are capable 
of finding happiness anywhere you 
go. Had you been accepted to 
Berkeley, or wherever it was you 
would have preferred to go, you 
would still be drowning, unnoticed, 
in a sea of undergraduates. I think it 
is time to move on and join the pre-
sent. 

With roughly 270 registered stu -
dent organizations on this campus, 
I lind it hard to believe thatlinding 
someone who shares one's interests 
is really that hard to do. Too many 
people at UCSD subscribe to the 
ridiculous notion that tinding this 
person is an impossible feat. Before 
you repeat one more time that you 

Too many students 
are so concerned 
with making money 
after college that 
they have stuck 
themselves with 
stale majors. This Is 
their own fauH. The 
best way to make 
friends Is to get 
Involved In activities 
outside of class. 
Quit worrying about 
that tenth of a point 
In you GPA, and 
experience life on 
the other side. 
hate UCSD because it 's boring, 
think you should check out a few of 
these groups, Snap yourself out of 
thi s self-pity mode. Quit being so 
lazy and prove yourself wrong. 

I have always believed that a 
place is what you make of it - and

absence of a jumping co llege town 
should not be an excuse for a bor-
ing college life. I have met numer-
ous inspiring and creati ve individu-
al s in San Diego. These are people 
who have shaped my college expe-
rience and inspired my pursuit of 
photojournalism. Whether or not 
you allow yourself to be touched 
by the truly brilliant minds on and 
around this campus is entirely up to 
you. 

Too many students are so con-
cerned with making money after 
co llege that Ihey have chosen 
majors they hat e. This is their own 
fa ult. The best way to make fri ends 
is to get in volved in ac ti vities out -
side of class. Quit worrying about 
that tenth of a point in your GPA, 
and experience life on the other 
side of those cinder block walls. 

I hope that my future employers 
will hire people based on factors 
other than just good grades. I hope 
that they will look for individuals 
with unique qualities, rather than 
academic machines. Quit making 
excuses for yourself, and face it : 
You, and only you, are the cause of 
your own boredom . By constantly 
placing blame on your fellow stu-
dent s, your pro fessors and this 

town, you refuse to accept respon-
sibility for your own happiness. It 
makes no difference how many 
people you knew in high school, or 
even how much these people really 
liked you. When you arri ved at 
UCSD you did so with a clean 
slate. It 's time to realize thi s and 
start fresh. 

Thus, my final advice tu new 
students is thi s: As you encounter 
new people on this campus, make a 
conscious decision to stay away 
from those who dwell in their neg-
ati ve altitude toward UCSD. These 
people are draining to be around , 
and wi II eventually drag you down 
with them. Don' t blindly resign 
yourse lf to di s ati sfadion like so 
many students at UCSD have done, 
try something new and let yourself 
be happy.

PSYCHO THERAPY 
Learning isn't the easiest thing, but someone's got to do it 
forget , I can always spiee things up 
if your problems are boring. ['m 
here for you. 

Even if you don' t have any 
problems now, I can guarantee you 
will have some in the near future. I 
don't want to be a pess imist, but 
we' re in the midst of week one and 

·things are going to get worse . Biol-
ogy majors, for exampl e, are 
already studying for their first 
round of midterms. 

Note 10 freshmen: Havc you 
noticed your communication-major 
roommates stud ying yet'? No, uf 

UCSD with a degree in vi sual arts. 
Freshman year, hi s midterm pro-
ject consisted of baking a giant 
cookie. Sophomore year, he made 
a Ii fe-sized mOdel of a man mas-
turbating and di spl ayed it in th ' 
middle of the Muir quad. And so 
on. 

The moral of the story is thi s: 
Instead of cramming for endless 
math and physics exams, you could 
spend your college years earning 
A's by turning kit chen appli ances 
into art . Brilli ant. 

Personally, I th ink it's a shame 

under the impression that their 
time here at UCSD is going to be 
meaningful. 

For example, I was walking to 
class the other day and I overheard 
a bright-eyed youngster exclaim, 
' 'I'm so excited ahout my chem-
istry class!" 

Like any concerned indi vidual, I 
prompt Iy whacked the kid on the 
head wi th my backpack. 

"What 's wrong with you?" I 
shouted. 

What I did may seem unusually 
harsh, but these kids have to learn 

units every quarter; I hope I never 
graduate! I' m especially happy 
right now because fall quarter hap-
pens to be my favorite time of 
year. 

First of all , the weather is still 
nice enough to hang out at the 
beach, so I actually have a justifi -
cation for ditching class. During 
the rest of the year, I feel guilty. 

The second reason .Ilike,fall quarter is n~en 's water 
polo , In my opinion, polo is the greatest sport ever 
invented . Brawling, swearing, spitting". and that Js 

The second reason [ like fall 
quarter is men's water polo. In~ my 
opinion, polo is the greatest sport 
ever invented. BraWling. swear-
ing, spitting ... and that 's just the 
players' morns who are sitting in 
the audience! This sport is even 
more exciting than ice hockey 
hecause there is always the possi -
hility of dro wning. Triton polo is 
da' bomb. If you aren' t out there 
cheering on our guys, then you 
should be ashamed to call yourself 
a Triton. 

just the play er's moms who are Sitting in the 
audience.! Triton polo is da ' bomb. Another reason I lik e fa ll 

quart er is the abundance or holi-
da ys. Thanksgiving is a much-
needed vacation from school, and 
also a vacation from my usual , 
diet of Top Ramen and Kraft 
Macaroni & Cheese. In addition , 
Halloween is a festive occas ion 
even though we don' t get to skip 
schoo l. 

course not. This is because they 
don' t have midternls. The sooner 
you lig ure this out, the sooner you 
can start making the ki nd of wise 
choiccs thai wi ll affect the rest of 
your lire. 

Speaking of majors, it is a com-
mon misconcept ion that "hard sci-
en.:e" stude nts arc the smartest 
people at this schoo l. Let mt.! illus-
tra te why thi~ is not the case . I 
know th is guy who graduated from 

more partners per day. Ninety-three 
percent I' the ~treet kids admi tted 
10 havi ng a sexually transmi tted 
disease and none of them used. con-
tracepti ves. 

The sexual trade that these chil-
dren engage in is perpetuated 
hecause of the ris ing poverty levels 
and is becoming increasi ngly dead-
ly. Fo r instance, the number of 
street children in Mexico with 
A.I.D.S. is increas ing, and the go v-
ernment is unable to provide them 
with any kid of adequate hea lth 
treatment. 

In 1988, the HouJton Chronic/e 
reported that, out of 121 Mex ican 
street children surveyed, approxi-
mately 7 percent tested positive for 

that we ever have to declarc a 
major at all. Remember when you 
got to thi , schou I and you still had 
hope and potenti al? Here 's how I 
can tell the difference between 
freshmen and the rest of the stu-
dent body: The freshman are smil-
ing. They haven ' t fai led any class-
es yet. They haven 't slept through 
a midterm. They are still maki ng 
an effort to he nice to thei r roOIll -
mates. Saddest of all. they are still 

HI Y. 
Numbing the Pain 

Somc co ld, hungry and lonely 
street kids snilT glue and s~ l vents 
to help them forge t their surrou nd-
ings. Inhalants may make Ihe 
street kids fee l hetter, but they arc 
addi cting. Chronic use of Ihem is 
deadl y. 

" A child add ict can get through 
about a gallon of glue in a month," 
a Casa Alianza report stated. "Tht.! 
glue causes a host of physical and 
psychological prohlems, including 
hallucinations, pulmonary edema, 
kidney failure and irreversihle 
brair. damage." 

According to Ca 'a Ali anza, 
inhalant abuse al so keeps the kids 

- thi s is not fun, thi s is UCSp. 
Patientl y, I waited for him to stop 
cry ing and helped him pick up hi s 
graphing calculator and his copy of 
Zumdahl. 

"Bad!" I yelled, holding his lab 
manual just out I' reach. "Bad, 
evil , wicked book!" 

I think he learned hi s lesson. 
You'd neva guess it from the 

way I write, hut I actually love 
U SD. That's why I onl y take 4

onen res ult s in drastic, pennancnl 
personality changes. The kids suf-
fer from mood s wings and 
hecomc more aggressive. They

selves. Casa Alianza reports that 
meaningful re hahilitati on of a 
glue-addicted child is nearly 
imposs ible. 
Problem Children 

Street children steal and sniff 
glue, actions that bi as peo ple 
against them. 

"Once they are seen snill'ing 
glue, street children are seen as 
trash and not even worthy of pity," 
Al varado Conde. Casa Alianza's 
Guatemalan direetor said in an

The Future 

The four police oflicers who 
beat armona to death were 
released from prison two years agu 
after servi ng six years of a 12-year

Carmona was buried in the Casa

provided for him by volunteers 
reads, "I only wanted to be a child, 
but they wouldn't let me."

How do you feel about 
religious groups on campus? 
Interviews by Jennifer Grady 
Photography by Dave Lubitz 

"I believe lhat it 's a good 
thing for those that have 
religion in part of their 
lives because it helps to 
guide them, and there are 
events for them to be a 
parI of on campus. 
Whatever helps to get you 
through the day is what 
matters ." 

Kamrun Zargar 
Muir Senior 

"Personal! y, the religious 
groups dan ', bother me at 
all. I reall y don 't care if 
they ' re here or not as long 
as they don 't get in my 
way. The only problem I 
have is when people come 
up to you and take up your 
time." 

Tony Knight 
Revelle Senior 

"It 's pretty cool because it 
creates more diversity and 
lets you know what kind of 
religious groups are out 
there. It creates more 
knowl edge, especially 
since the groups do lheir 
activities on campus. I 
don ' t think their presence 
is bad. " 

Linaflore Sagadraca 
Revelle Senior 

"I can' t walk across 
campus without gelling 
accosted by some religious 
group. Do I just have 
's inner' written on my 
forehead?" 

Luke Armstrong 
Marshall Senior 

"I think that the religious 
groups should be able to 
be on campus and ha ve 
activi ties but I don 't like it 
when they try and force 
themselves on people. I 
think that they should be 
free to have activities and 
do whatever they want, 
just like any other group."

Thc green of the grass, the cheer of the

from the rafters and along the infield grass,

Volunteers are needed for Research Drug Studies. 

McFarland said that although the outside 
hitters have heen gelling some really good 
se ts via Christine Kueneman (who had 74 
assists in Saturday's game), other teams 
have learned to gang up on UCSD's out side 
hiuers because they are used so freq uently. 
McFarland said that he believes mixing 
things up wi ll throw ofT futurc opponents' 
defens.:. 

From our seats in the upper dec k, we 
had a bird 's-eye view of the entire game.

free-agent pitcher, perform wonderfu lly on

Throwing off the Cal Lutheran defense 

might not have been such a bad idea on 
Saturday night. The Tritons took game 
three, a marathon of a game. into extra 
poi nt s before exhausting 20- 18. 

"We had some opportunit ies to wi n it, 
hut errors cost us." McFarland said. 

We even saw a great catch made by the 
fan two levels below us. We also saw the 
umpire call the bailer out and security 
escon the fan out the stadium . 

Anything can happen during the play-
offs. So when my friend turned to me and 
prophesied, "Just watch, thi s guy's go ing to 
hit a home run ," there was no need to argue. $500 (Asthma Study) Game four, which cnded in a 16-14 loss for UCSD, told the same story: hilling errors. Though there were some bad errors, 

Bender added that Saturday 's game "wasn' t 
such a bad loss." 

I heard the crack of the bat and saw the 
ball sailing high in the night sky. All 65,000 
uttered one co llet:ti ve gasp as it soarcd 
toward left field . There was crazed pande-
monium as the ball left the yard .

That Saturday night at the ball park was 
a little slice of history, and we were lucky 
cnough to witness it. 

Last ni ght , the Padres beat Randy

Tritons Soar at Stan'ford 
STRENGTH: UCSD set a good tone for the season during meet 
By Saul Sheridan 
Staff Writer 

For cvery team, there is one game that 
everyone will poinlto as the match that set the 
tone for the entire season. Ther is one 
moment when you feel thc momen-
tum shifting. 

Sometimes il is when a 
key playcr is lost due to an 
injury, causing the team to 
spiral downward through a medi ocre 
season. 

Other times, when it puts together an 
inspiring performance, the team is able 10 ride 
that wave of confidence throughout the rest of 
the season. 

Whcn the UCS D cross (;ountry team's sea-
son is over, it might look hack on thi s week-
end's performance at the Stanford Invitational 
as the key meet that gave it the momentum 
and the wnlidem.;e to enjoy a very success ful 
season. 

Fal:ing an onslaught of top Di vision I and 
II teams, the Triton speed squad put together 
one of its strongest team performance of the 
season. 

When it was all over, the men 's tcam tin -
ished second overall and the women 's team 
fini shed sixth in a field that included teams 
from Stani'ord , USD and Chi w State. 

"The Stanford In vitational is the biggest 
invitational on the wes t coast," senior runner

defender John Brandon said . " I suppose it 
goe, hack to the old saying that the harder 
you press. the more you cxpose yourselr." 

Such was the case in the H6th minute when 
the Hawks counter-attacked the pressing 
Tritons and got a hreakaway on Curtolo. He 
was beaten. but he tripped the Hawk player 
trying tn st:Ore and was n:d-carded hy the ref-
cree. 

Curtolo was obviously not happy wit h the 
ca rd. Neither was Adams, who cmhod ied thi s 
Triton team 's i'rustration. The usuall y mind-

The Triton squad also receivcd an out -

standing performance from seni or Franzwa 
Achie. Achi e gave the Triton men their 'cc-

ond top- 10 finish of the day, when he 
came in ninth wit h a time of 26:02. 

"James I Niclsen I and 
Franzwa IAchie l were 
reall y great," Walsh said. 
"They really led the way 

for the re ·t of us." 
Fol lowing Nielsen and Achie, were 

junior Damian Garcia and senior co-captain 
Kevin Prindiville. Garcia charged in with a 
time of 26:34, good enough for a 22nd-place 
linish. Prindiville came in on Garcia 's heals 
wi th a time of 26:44. 

"As a team, this might have been our hest 
performance evcr," Prindivi lle silid . "Not onl y 
did we beat some really good tcams, but we 
also beat teams from our own confe rence. I 
think wc showed that we are going to be a 
presence in the confcrence this year. " 

The Tri ton women's tcam, led hy junior 
Meghan Scott . enjoyed simila r success at 
Stanford . Scali dominated all of her Div ision

runner was six places behind her. 

The Triton tri o of Li nda Monroe, Lisa 
K'linger and Arnie Wu clocked in ti mes of 
19:59, 20:0 I and 20:02, respectively. 

"r think the meet was good for the wholc

good teams. The team is rea lly looking good." 

Head Coach Ted Van Ar,dale said he was

Everything Goes Wrong for Men's Soccer 
TOUGH ROAD: Tritons have now lost two in a row and face Cal Lu, their most hated rival, tonight on RIMAC Field at 7 p.m. 
By Travis Hili 
ASSOCIate Sports EdItor 

First. the good new~: Lightning 
didn't ~trike th..: ne ld . There wert:

didn' l <.:ra,h into one of the 
goah,. A~ f(lr the hat.!

il:ance after a glance at UCSD'~ 
next opponent: California Lutheran 

ni ver~i t y. Since the rulehook 
stale, Ihat a player who receives a 

red l:ard must , it out the 
team's m:xt mald1, two of 

the lOp TrilOns will be on 

just about everything ,.,,,.is 0 C C E R I the si<.l elines in street clothcs lor to<.lay\ 
hattie againsl e l,..: . Basically, nut -
~Id..: of natura l di saster, 
everything that w uld have 
gone wrong for the UCSD men's 
soccer squad last Friday night did . 

Thc Hawk s of Chri ~ tl an 
Hel itage College ca me into La 
Jolla and delcated the heleaguered 
Triton~ , 3-0. A 3-0 lo~s is a had 
cnough. hut th..: rami li ca ti ons of 
thi s gam~ go much further than the 
lall.:sttally in the 10'1'1 co lumn. 

The ChrISti an Heriwge loss put~ 
CS D (3-5- 1) in a precariou~ post -
,ea~Cll1 po~itl(ln . In order for the 
Tritons to ha ve any hope of reach-
ing the playoffs. they must regroup 
and ge t wins against al Lu , 
Chapman C() lI ege and Pomona-
Pitzer Colleg\!. Those three schools 
arc all Divis i() n III rivals for 
UCSD, and a loss 10 any of them 
will most likely push the Tritons 
out of p()sts~as() o contention. 

To make muliers much worse, 
the Tritons haLl two of their top 
players, goa lkceper Lucas Curtolo 
and central midfielder Cameron 
Adams, red-carded with less than 
live l11inute~ to play Friday night. 

The ejections or Curtolo and 
Adams wke on even greater signif-

I 
I 

SD's higgest ri val. 
And muyhe more 

frightcning than all of Ihat is 
th l! damagl! that Ihis loss to 
Chri stian Heritage <.lid the coll ec-
t i ve p'Yl.:he of Hea<.l Com:h Derek 
Arrm.trong \ troops. Team morale 
is ex tremely low in the Triton 
camp. and a 1m,s like Friday's can 
he a devastating one, cspel.: ially 
after the lOugh l os~ to Redlands 

niversit y earlier last week . Both 
Redland, and Christian Heritage 
arc sq uad, thai the Tritons could 
have I!asi Iy heaten . and losse~ like 
those arl! especially painful. 

The irony of last Friday's loss is 
that UC D didn ' t play that hadly. 
The Tritons were in it until the 
nnw-infamous douhle red card . The 
game went hm:k and forth for much 
of til ..: first half. But I!a rly in the 
44th minutc, lit era ll y momcnts 
heforc the halftime whistk, thc 
Tritons ha<.l a defensive breakdown 
around their own I !i-yard twx. 
They paid the price as Carlos Rios 
put a nice shot into the corner of the 
Tritons ' net. 

The Hawks's goal wntinued a 
disturhing trend for UCSD, which 

l

My aall: Triton central midfielder Bryan Song fights for a loose ball with a Christian Heritage 
defender during last Friday night's 3-0 loss at the hands of the Hawks on RIMAC Field . 

has h<ld an annoying habit of going 
into the hreak hehind oy a goal. But 
in the s~~o nd hair Friday night , the 
Tritons w ntinued another trend , 
and that is playing so lid socce r. 
With the Hawks sitting hack and 
trying to prese rve their lead , the 
Tritons look full advantage and 
hegan to dominate possession . For 
most of the second half, UCSD had 
the ball on the Hawks' side of the 

pitch . 
UCS D produced some quality 

opportunities, and Triton forward 
Scan Salinas actually did put the 
hall in the net. But on the cross into 
the hox, the hall skipped olT Doug 
McBride's hand before falling to 
Salinas ' fcet , thus negating the 
goal. It was that kind of night for 
the Triton offense. UCSD got good 
work from McBride, Salinas and 

'18 

Mike Sanders, hut the hoys just 
couldn 't fini sh. 

But the Trituns pushed on, 
working extremely hard . They 
were pushing most of their players 
up , desperat ely trying to score. 
Then it happened . 

"Sometimes it gets to the point 
where you press so much that you 
leave yourself open," fifth-year

Good Will Bunting 

bunting: vb I : to push or tap 
(a baseball ) lig htl y without 
'winging the bat. II 2: a li ght -
weight loosely woven fabric 
used mostly for fla gs and fes-
tive decorations. 3: decorations 
esp. in the colors of the nation-
al flag. 

Saturday, as I was heading to 
the Padre playoff game, I men-
tioned to my friends that I was 
excited to see all the bunting. 
Most of them nodded unt.!er-
slandingly, except for one. 

"What docs that mean')'" she 
asked. "Do they really hunl 
more during the playoffs'!!'!" 

Ba sehall is fill ed with 
strange terms known to no more 
than the few ardent followers of 
the game. Batted balls can he a 
''t:an of com," a "t.!ucksnort " or 
a "frozen rope." The "rubber" is 
what the pitcher stands on. The 
"warning track" lines the out-
field . Yet, no word in baschall 
has morc mean i ngs lhan 
hunting . 

Not just a way for weak-hit-
ting pitchers to he lp out the 
team, bunting means mu ch 
more to baseball . When you sec 
bunting, you know it's the play-
oils . Bunting is those red. white 
and blue fan -shaped decorations 
that line the infield fences dur-
ing the postseason. 

Baseball is the AlTleri~an 
Pastime, and consequently 
patrioti sm is part of the game. 
Only those best tea ms in the 
league get to play in the play-
offs; only those chosen few get 
to hang bunting along the rail-
ing. The bunting is a symbol 
that thi s ain ' t no ordinary game 
- this is th..: big time. This 
game is for the season. It 's 
everything that a team's 
worked for a year. The intensi-
ty has been turned up a notch . 
Wh en you see a stadium 
decked out in the red. white 
and blu e, you know you're 
ahout to sec something spec ial. 
The excitement is always 
there. 

As I walked through the 
brightly colored archway at the 
old Jack Murphy Stadium last 
Friday, I could feel it. Inside the 
stadium were over 65,000 fans 
ready for the lirst playolT game 
in San Diego since the infamous 
St. Loui s debacle two years ago. 
It was the largest crowd in Padre 
history. 

Picture it: 65,000 screaming 
Padre fan s swinging white 
handkerchiefs wi Idly around 
their heads, as their home team 
took the lield . Imagine 65,000 
Padre fans l:heering Tony 
Gwynn for over 10 minutes. 
The PA announcer couldn't get 
a word in edgewise. There was 
no denying it, the e lectricity in 
the ·tadium was infectious.

UCSD 
tromps over 

Chapman 
but defeats 
itself in a 
difficult 

away match 
against 

hated rival 
CalLu 

By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

Well , the women 's voll eyba ll 
team isn ' t perfect. Hey, the 
pl ayers are onl y 
human. 

Despi te out-
right domination 
of Chapman 
Universi ty last Friday at 
RIMAe. where the squad won 
again in strai ght games 15-7, 15-7, 
15-6, the Tritons couldn ' t string 
together wins in Saturday ni ght's 
match against the Regals of Cal 
Lutheran Universi ty. 

Though UCSD dug in 
Saturday night, they cou ldn ' t hold 
on and fell in four games 15-6, 
IS-9,20-1!i. 16- 14 . 

Usa Huff/ Guardian 
Spiked: Senior outside hitter Katherine Brynjestad blasts another 
kill home against Chapman , but UCSD lost to Cal Lu in 4 games . 

Before tra ve ling to Th usand 
Oaks to take on Cal Lutheran, the 
Tritnns had heen playing so lid 

b,,11 with few unforced 
errors. In Friday night 's 

vil:tory over 
Chapman, 
UCSD com-

mitted only 7 
se rvi ce errors and 23 hitting 

errors. Saturday's game, however, 
had a di ffercnt chime to it. 

"We played hard volleyball," 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland 
said. "But the difference was that 
we had too many unforced 
errors 

Junior out side hitter Alli son 
Bender also felt that UCSD didn ' t 
have it s stronges t showing 

Saturday. 
"We weren 't playi ng had, but 

we weren ' t playing good ei ther," 
Bender sa id. 

Against the Rcgals, the Tritons 
racked up 19 serving errors and 
doubled Friday's 23 hilling errors. 

"When you have 19 service 
errors and only three se rvice aces, 
you are missing a lot of opportu-
nities," McFarland added. 

Senior Dana Salter put it blunt-
ly "They played out of thei r heads 
and we didn't playas well as we 
could, but we still hung with them 
most of the way 

Though the Triton ' did blow a 
few se rves, there was sti II some 
solid play from UCSD's outside 
attack. 

Sophomore ou tside hitter 
Leslie Punelli had a huge night for 
the Tritons, putting away 20 kills 
and one service ace . Punell i "Iso 
helped out on the defensive side. 
leading UCSD with 27 digs. 

"Les li e Punelli and Katherine 
Brynjestad played an outst"nding 
game for us," ~cFarland said. 
"Allison IBender] also played 
another solid game." 

Brynjestad came in second 
behind Punelli with 17 kills. and 
Bender came through with 15. 

Though Punelli , Brynjestad 
and Bender's performances show 
the Tritons' strength over the net , 
they also reveal some of UCSD\ 
weaknesses.

New GOTW Feature Added 
CHALLENGE: Tritons take on rival Cal Lu today at 7 p.m. on RIMAC field 
By Travis Hili 
ASSOCIate Sports Editor 

In the grand tradition of the 
Guardian Sports sec tion 's cUlling-
edge journalism, we are pleased to 
announce a new weekly spons fea-
ture. 

As a se rvice to you, the fan , 
Guardian Sports will present its 
"Game of the Week" in eac h 
Monday issue. 

Our "Game of the Week" will 
feature the UCSD sporti ng event 
that our esteemed Sport ' staff feels 
is the week's most important event. 

"Game of the Week" will 
include a shon article on the game 
and a catchy graphic wilh all the 

important detai Is. 
Last Monday 's debut "Game of 

the Week" highlighted the 
women's volleyball team's battle 
against Chapman College. . 

This week 's "Game of the 
Week" is tonight 's contest between 
the men 's soccer squad and the 
hated Cal Lu Kingsmen. Cal Lu i 
probably UCSD's biggest rival. 
especia lly on the soccer pitch. The 
game starts al 7 p.m. at Triton 
Soccer Stadium on RIMAC's north 
lield. 

This game is immensely impor-
tant to UCSD 's postseason hopes. 
The Tritons will be without three of 
their top players: goalkeeper Lucas 

Cunolo, l:entral midfielder 
Cameron Adams and forward 
Brady Bernard. UCSD is coming 
oil of two tough losses to Redlands 
University ( 1-0) and Chrsitian 
Heritage College (3-0). 

Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
and his troops will be tired up for 
tonight's contest and looking to 
hand the Kingsmen a loss. 

This game has become an annu-
al war for UCSD and the previous 
matches have been very light. 

The Trit9lls need all the upport 
they can get tonight, 50 make some 
time and get out to the field. Thi 
game promises to be a spectacular 
contest.
