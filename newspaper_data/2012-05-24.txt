Former 
Student 
Dies From 
Tumor
BY ZEV HURWTIZ
Associate News Editor

Former Warren College freshman 
Chris Whitmore died May 20 from a 
brain tumor. He was 18.

On May 22, Whitmore’s parents 
published via his Facebook profile the 
news that he had passed away.

‘[Chris] had been fighting a brain 
tumor for the past 18 months,” his 
parents wrote in the post.  “Sadly, this 
is one kind of cancer for which there is 
not yet any effective prevention.”

Whitmore withdrew from classes 
upon learning his tumor had wors-
ened. He spent the last several months 
at home in Davis, Calif.

“I wish I could be there myself, 
but the luck of the draw says no,” 
Whitmore wrote in a facebook mes-
sage to a group of friends in December. 

Whitmore is survived by his par-
ents, Robin and Carl Whitmore, and 
his brother Nathan.

In a recent clinical study at the 
UCSD School of Medicine, research-
ers discovered that multiple sclero-
sis patients who smoked marijuana 
had reduced symptoms. Professor 
of Neuroscience and Director of the 
Multiple Sclerosis Center at UCSD, 
Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom led the study, 
which was published in the Canadian 
Medical Association Journal on May 
14.

The study revealed that adult 
patients who smoked marijuana dis-
played improved range of motion 
and experienced up to 50 percent 
less pain.  

“We found that smoked cannabis 
was superior to placebo in reduc-
ing symptoms and pain in patients 
with treatment-resistant spasticity, or 
excessive muscle contractions,” Dr. 
Corey-Bloom said in a UCSD Health 
Systems press release dated May 14.

Dr. Corey-Bloom and her col-
leagues used 30 MS patients for the 
study. The test subjects were ran-
domly assigned to either the inter-
vention group, which received a 
marijuana cigarette to smoke daily 

for three days — or to the control 
group, which also smoked an identi-
cal placebo cigarette for three days. 

After eleven days, the participants 
were crossed over to the other group 
so that all 30 MS patients eventually 
smoked marijuana.

However, researchers also report-
ed short-term and adverse effects 
in cognition, namely the ability to 
pay attention and concentrate, and 
increased fatigue among the patients. 
The press release said that the mild 
effects on focus and awareness could 
be a result of smoking the drug 
instead of the traditional method 
of orally administered cannabinoids, 
which have been used in the past. 
Past studies have shown to effective-
ly treat neurologic conditions using 
oral intake of cannabis.  

Last May, another similar study 
was published in the journal of 
Neurology, in which researchers from 
the University of Toronto showed 
that MS patients who smoked mari-
juana to alleviate symptoms could 
double the risk of cognitive detri-
ment.

A May 15 article in the San Diego 
Reader said that researchers at the 
UCSD School of Medicine are call-

ing for larger, long-term studies. The 
School of Medicine wants to confirm 
the recent findings as well as test the 
effectiveness of lower doses of can-
nabis. With a lower dose, researchers 
hope to reduce the negative impact 
on cognitive function.

In the recent clinical study, par-
ticipants had a breakdown of 63 per-
cent female, 37 percent male and had 
an average age of 50 years old. Over 
half of the participants required aids 
such as walkers, while 20 percent 
used wheelchairs.

The University of California 
Center for Medicinal Cannabis 
Research funded the research. 
CMCR said this is the fifth promis-
ing study currently underway.

“The study by Corey-Bloom and 
her colleagues adds to a growing 
body of evidence that cannabis has 
therapeutic value for selected indica-
tions, and may be an adjunct or alter-
native for patients whose spasticity 
or pain is not optimally managed,” 
director of the CMCR, Dr. Igor Grant 
said in the UCSD Health Systems 
press release.

A.S. COUNCIL 

Council: 
UCPD to 
Disclose 
Protocol 

BY AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

A.S. Council passed a resolution 
on May 9 condemning the University 
of California Police Department 
for its alleged policy of monitoring 
UCSD student activists. This resolu-
tion was the third resolution council 
has passed regarding UCPD in the 
last five months.

As part of the resolution, A.S. 
Council filed a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a feder-
al law that requires most government 
agencies to disclose agency records. 
The request is designed to reveal all 
documents UCPD has complied on 
students they have been monitoring 
and the extent to which undercover 
police officers have been used. 

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs 2011-12 Samer Naji draft-
ed the resolution last quarter, and 
received sponsorship from former 
A.S. President Alyssa Wing and 
former Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Bryce Farrington. 
The resolutions, which council 
passed during the third week of 
Winter Quarter, condemn the use of 
police violence last November at UC 
Davis and UC Berkeley. 

According to Naji, student activ-
ists first suspected they were being 
monitored in December 2011, when 
they broke into CLICS to reopen the 
former library. University police offi-
cers were already present upon the 
students’ arrival. 

“That automatically alerted us 
that they might be monitoring or 
keeping track of the things student 
leaders were doing on campus,” Naji 
said. 

The student activists made sure 
that information disseminated online 
was distributed through secure 
networks, to prevent UCPD or the 
administration from uncovering the 
details of their plans, according to 
Naji.  

Students from the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee, the 
Public Education Coalition and the 
A.S. Office of External Affairs — all 
three of which were involved in the 

In a resolution passed 
May 9, Council filed a 
request for UCPD to 
disclose documentation 
regarding monitoring.

THE BEST MOVIE OF THE SEASON (NOT BATTLESHIP)  PAGE 6



BY REBECCA HORWITZ
Staff Writer

Researchers have discovered 
genetic pathways in autistic brains 
that affect its development and 
offer a possible explanation for how 
the disorder develops. Director of 
the Autism Center of Excellence 
at the UCSD School of Medicine 
Eric Courchesne led the study, pub-
lished March 23 in PLoS Genetics. 
The study found that several of the 
genetic networks that play a role 
in the management of early brain 
development function abnormally 
in the frontal cortex of an autistic 
brain.

Courchesne and his team used 
frozen brain tissue from the prefron-
tal cortex of autistic children, aged 
two to four, and control children 
who are not autistic, who had passed 
away to analyze brain tissue gene 
expression. The prefrontal cortex is 
the part of the brain responsible for 
cognitive communication and social 

development, and its development is 
abnormal in autistic children. They 
found that a large number of genes 
that control the number of brain 
cells were expressed incorrectly.

Many studies have shown that 
brain cells in autistic individuals 
may be too small and undeveloped. 
After cells are born, they differenti-
ate into specific types of brain cells 
that are in charge of the different 
types of information processing. The 
abnormalities in these cells occur 
in the second and third trimester 
of pregnancy, the time span during 
which most brain cells are created.

“This evidence indicates that 
biological abnormalities in autism 
began in the prenatal stage and 
that the biological abnormalities of 
autism are complex,” Courchesne 
said. “They involve a number of 
large networks or systems in genes 
and then the regulation of those 
systems with too much or too lit-
tle gene activity in those genes is 
responsible.”

They found evidence that many 
of the abnormally expressed genes 
correctly copied DNA during cell 
divisions. This suggests that the 
DNA defects associated with autism 
may not be detected while cells are 
dividing during prenatal cell devel-
opment. 

“Those DNA defects may creep 
into new cells that are being gener-
ated during prenatal development,” 
Courchesne said. “Those DNA 
defects may alter the functional 
integrity of brain cells.”

The first set of genes that were 
functionally abnormal was the sets 
of genes that regulate the num-
ber of brain cells. Courchesne said 
this may explain why many people 
with autism have an excess num-
ber of brain cells in the prefrontal 
area, and why the abnormal activity 
involved in DNA checking and cor-
rection may explain why some brain 
cells do not function correctly.

The team then found abnormal 
activity of genes in the blocks of 

frontal tissue that regulate the orga-
nizational patterning of the brain. 
They found abnormal activity in the 
genes that regulate the further devel-

re-opening of CLICS — suspected 
that their principal members were 
subject to police monitoring, Naji 
said. The groups’ leaders encouraged 
councilmembers to demand informa-
tion from the UCPD during finals 
week of Fall Quarter. Their request 
ultimately led to A.S. Council draft-
ing the resolution throughout winter 
quarter, and passing the resolution 
on May 9. 

Naji said he discovered a police 
officer dressed in plainclothes stand-
ing alongside students at this year’s 
March 1 “Day of Action” protest at 
UCSD. 

“I personally uncovered an under-
cover agent who was present at the 
protests,” Naji said. “He was talking 
to the police chief, and I know exactly 
what he looks like.” 

According to Naji, a long debate 
went into the situation, between a 
group of students that included Naji 
and a group of administrators that 

included the Vice Chancellor for 
Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews, the undercover 
officer and Chief of police Orville 
King. At the end of it, the protesters 
got the undercover officer to reveal 
his badge, confirming that he was a 
police officer, Naji said.

However, in a March 1 story in 
the Daily Californian, UCSD spokes-
person Jeff Gattas said that police 
officers dressed in “plainclothes” are 
used at all student gatherings. 

“It’s our protocol,” he said. 
Naji said he was concerned by the 

UCPD’s wide-ranging use of plain-
clothes police officers. “They try 
to differentiate and say that they’re 
‘plainclothes’ and not ‘undercover,’ 
when they’re essentially the same 
thing.”

A.S. Council and Student Legal 
Services will pursue the demands of 
the May 9 resolution, which call for 
increased transparency from UCPD. 
Naji said he is optimistic about the 
resolution’s ability to inform students 

about the UCPD’s internal policies 
regarding monitoring student activ-
ists. 

“If they [UCPD] don’t give us the 
information voluntarily, we’ll get it 
legally,” Naji said.  

Current VP of External Affairs 
Olamide Noah said that, as far as she 
knew, Naji is still working to ensure 
the demands of the resolution are ful-
filled. President Meggie Le declined 
to comment. Noah and Le said that 
because the last A.S. Council passed 
the resolution, they would not be able 
to speak about it. 

Assistant manager of the 
University Office of Communications 
and Public Affairs Christine Clark 
said the news of the resolution had 
not yet reached her office, or UCPD. 

Vice Chancellor Gary Matthews 
and UCPD spokesperson Jeff Gattas 
could not be reached for comment as 
of press time.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 24,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

This week, in an effort to garner 
more participation from members 
of the public, the A.S. Council met 
in Price Center Ballroom East.

The Student Promoted Access 
Center For Education and 
Services gave a 
presentation to 
Council about 
the origin of their 
program and 
how they plan to 
continue to grow 
in the future. 
The California 
government has cut $20,000 from 
SPACES operating budget, but 
it continues with an 80 percent 
success rate for admitted high 
school seniors who submitted 
statements of intent to register..

Sean O’Neal presented a 
resolution in condemnation 
of the FDA for permanently 
deferring blood donations from 
males who have sex with males. 
Council reordered business to put 
the resolution to a vote, adding 
a suggestion that instead of 
permanent deferral, MSM’s should 
be placed in a 12 month deferral 
period — the same as other high 
risk groups. The resolution passed 
unanimously.

“I don’t believe we as a 
university should support such a 
policy,” O’Neal said.

Andrew Buselt, Sean Estelle 
and Victor Honrubia from the 
Student Sustainability Collective 
reported to Council about the 
actions they took this year and the 
need for an associate vice president 
of sustainability. 

AVP Concert and Events Oliver 
Zhang announced to Council that 
the last Bear Garden of the year 
would be held Friday June 8th, in 
honor of the graduating seniors.

VP Student Life Cody Marshall 
told Council that AVP interviews 
will occur this Friday at noon.

AVP Student Advocacy Bryce 
Farrington in his last meeting as 
a councilmember declared that 

the Know Your 
Rights campaign 
has been very 
successful.

“I know it was 
a great success 
because I still 
see those flyers 
littered all over 

the place,” Farrington said.
There was no councilmember 

of the week but instead two council 
bachelors of the week, Warren 
Senators Hue Tran and Nhat-Dang 
Do.

Council discussed combining 
the roles of advocate general and 
speaker into one position known 
as “the Speaker.” After discussion 
the resolution was sent back to the 
Rules Committee along with the 
other resolutions presented by the 
Rules Committee.

Council also discussed the 
virtues of cardigans over hoodies in 
considering what they should make 
as their A.S. Council clothing.

“V-necks and bro-tanks all 
day, everybody get buff wear your 
brotanks,” VP External Affairs 
Olamide Noah said.

After much deliberation and 
many straw polls Council decided 
on bro-tanks.

Noah also announced that the 
UCSA congress would be held on 
the UCSD campus August 17th to 
August 20th and asked Council to 
try to volunteer during those dates.

Marshall Senator Mariko Kuga 
told Council that  every college 
residential office has subsidized 
tickets for the Padres-Giants game.

opment of cells. Courchesne said 
they think this could explain why 
autism affects cognitive functions.

About a decade ago, it was discov-
ered that at young ages, the majority 
of autistic individuals have a brain 
that is too big. As the child develops 
and matures, there appears to be a 
loss of brain tissue. Courchesne and 
his team found evidence that there 
may be a growing loss of neurons 
in autistic individuals. The normal 
spacing of neurons begins to become 
more irregular, suggesting irregular 
locations of loss due to loss of brain 
tissue.

The team then looked at adults 
with autism and found different sig-

natures of gene activity that point to 
loss of cells and remodeling of brain 
conditions.

“What we don’t know is whether 
those changes are improving con-
nections or removing maladaptation 
connections, we just don’t know,” 
Courchesne said. “But we do know 
there’s a different profile that sug-
gests some kind of remodeling. And 
whether it’s ultimately beneficial or 
not remains for future studies to 
figure out.”

Another part of their study dis-
covered evidence that would explain 
why autism is genetically different in 
every individual with autism. There 
was overlap within the network in 
the brain to other individuals with 
autism, but it was incomplete. Each 

person has his own set of genes 
within a network that were the most 
effective.   Then another person has 
a somewhat overlapping, but dif-
ferent set of genes within the same 
network.

These genetic networks with 
abnormalities are the cause of 
autism. It can be confusing to under-
stand the genes involved in autism 
because each person with autism has 
a different set of genes within the 
same network.

“That’s probably why it’s so hard 
to understand what’s been so hard 
to get at the genetic root basis of 
autism,” Courchesne said.

Cutting Deep

Cut. Cut. Cut. That’s Gov. Jerry Brown’s mantra, especially during state budget season — a grim refrain that’s only 
going to get worse if voters don’t approve 
higher sales taxes and income taxes on the 
wealthy in November to cut $8.5 billion from 
the $16 billion deficit. What’s worse, if this tax 
measure fails, Brown’s proposed budget plan 
automatically cuts $5.5 billion from public 
schools.

So there’s your familiar ultimatum, 
California: More cuts to public education or 
higher taxes. The answer is even more familiar: 
With an in-crisis higher education system 
already overwhelming its students with tuition 
increases, our vote goes to the latter.

It’s hard to approve a budget that relies on a 
decision that hasn’t even been made yet. People 
will always wonder if there are other places in 
the budget that could get sliced, so that voters 
aren’t challenged come election day.

Brown’s proposed budget assumes that 
voters will approve the tax-hike initiative 
— deemed the “Schools and Local Public 
Safety Protection Act of 2012” — that would 

increase the state sales tax by a quarter of a 
percent (from 7.25 percent 7.5 percent) and 
raise income taxes on the wealthy, generating 
approximately $8.5 billion by the end of 
the budget year. If voters reject these hikes, 
there’ll be an even bigger hole in the budget 
that Brown will need to fill, inevitably, with 
education funding.

Brown’s back-up plan, should the tax-
initiative fail, consists of “trigger” cuts that 
would reduce funding for schools and 
community colleges by a staggering $5.5 billion, 
and higher education by $500 million. He’d also 
cut popular positions and services such as game 
wardens, park rangers and lifeguards.

The potential damage is so bad that it seems 
like Brown concocted it as a tool of persuasion 
to convince voters to approve his tax proposal 
anyway. But still, Chief Executive Magazine 
recently ranked California as the worst state 
to do business, evidence of the fact that an 
increase in California’s taxes — already some 
of the highest personal and corporate income 
and sales tax rates in the country — will be 
considered too straining on the corporations

This How-to Guru is for all the sport-illiterate boyfriends and girlfriends out there, the ones 
who feel left out of Great American 
Pastimes and who only enjoy the 
tailgate part of a sporting event. But 
fear not — it’s entirely possible to 
feign enthusiasm for sports and not 
make a complete ass of yourself. How-
to Guru has some choice tips about 
how to yell “Swing, batter batter” at 
the correct ballgame. Hint: baseball. 

First up: baseball, basketball 
and football. They are completely 
different, but the main thing you’re 

going to need to do is choose a team. 
Ideally, this team is either based 
in your hometown or one of the 
following. For baseball, go for the Red 
Sox, for basketball, the Lakers, and 
for football, the Patriots — or just 
talk about Tebow. That way, when 
people ask you why you have such a 
particular affinity for a certain team, 
your response doesn’t have to be a 
muttered explanation about how 
much you like the name “Mariners.”

But before you go off and start 
purchasing everything black and 
orange, don’t suddenly follow the 
Giants, even if you’re from the Bay 
Area. You’ll look like you’re jumping 
on the bandwagon (the Giants won 
the 2010 World Series, which is like 
the Super Bowl for baseball). And 
don’t say that you support the Padres, 
even though you live in the area. 
Nobody does, unless you’ve lived in 
San Diego County for decades. 

It’s a pretty safe bet to support 
soccer. Soccer fans are divided into 
two types: the hardcore fans who 
genuinely care about how well 
Liverpool is doing, and the ones who 
just like wearing those hip scarves. 
Make sure you can distinguish 
between the two before striking up a 
conversation in a sports bar. 

And of course, there are just the 
hipsters who watch soccer because 
it’s European. They can’t pass for 
football, baseball or basketball fans, 
so they devote their time to following 
four teams: Liverpool, Manchester 
United, Chelsea and Arsenal. They 
will support one of these teams with 
a passion only rivaled by the National 
Socialist Party and they will weep 
openly when their team loses. When 
you encounter this special breed 
of soccer fan, start chatting about 
Argentinian or Italian soccer — they 
will be completely befuddled.

More importantly, supporting 
soccer means caring about the World 
Cup. Every four years, soccer teams 
from around the world gather to 
compete for the cup. Remember, the 
team’s country-based, so there’s no 
supporting Liverpool — just England. 
And if you’re gathering with soccer-
fanatic friends, here are some betting 
patterns to follow: Italy is good, Brazil 
is good, Spain is in vogue and any 
team from Africa is a cute underdog. 
But most importantly, watching the 
World Cup means that it is socially 
acceptable to stay up all night 
drinking Newcastle Brown Ale. And 
if that’s not enough reason to watch a 
sport, I don’t know what is.

predecessor, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox. Though the money for his raise 
will not come from student fees, this 
raises a concern for the overall trend 
of increasing president salaries as 
universities struggle for funding.

This pay increase comes at a time 
when students are more overwhelmed 
than ever over UC system fees. This 
July, the UC Regents will vote on a 
6-percent tuition increase, which 
would lead to in-state undergrads 
paying nearly double what they paid 
five years ago, according to the UC 
Board of Regents report. This is 
especially painful after a 8-percent 

tuition increase this school year that 
already has students paying $1,818 
more in tuition. However, university 
spokesperson Steve Montiel insists 
that the additional money for Khosla’s 
salary will come from “non-state 
sources.” These additional funds will 
be located within auxiliary funds, 
self-supporting services, and private 
donations, according to Montiel in a 
press conference.

UCSD’s situation is reminiscent 
of the infamous $100,000 salary 
raise Eliot Hirshman received when 
he became SDSU’s new president 
this past summer. With a salary of 
$400,000 a year, Hirshman became 
the highest-paid administrator in 
the CSU system, and a major source 
of controversy resulting in a letter 
from Gov. Jerry Brown voicing his 
disapproval. While Khosla‘s pay 
raise is far less than Hirshman’s, it 
brings up this troublesome trend of 
inflating administrator salaries as 

the public universities fall deeper 
into financial hardship. According 
to Andrew Hacker, co-author of 
Higher Education? How Colleges are 
Wasting Our Money and Failing Our 
Kids – and What We can Do About 
it, president salaries at both public 
and private universities have nearly 
doubled since 1991. 

Khosla’s salary is certainly 
“modest” as Montiel put it, and is 
only a drop in the bucket compared 
to UCSD’s overall budget. But the 
dollar amount is not the concern, it 
is the principle of the matter. The fact 
that public universities continue to 
increase salaries makes a statement, 
even before a chancellor takes office. 
Granted, Khosla’s compensation is 
moderate compared to his public 
university counterparts — the median 
salary for presidents is $375,442 
in 2009-2010, according to The 
Chronicle of Higher Education. But 
when you look at Khosla’s, and many 

other university presidents’ salaries, 
they far exceed those of high profile 
public servants. Such as Kholsa 
nearly doubles Gov. Jerry Brown’s 
earnings, who has an annual salary 
of $212,179. He even beats President 
Obama’s 2010 salary of $395,188. 
It is a dramatic contrast between 
university administrator and public 
servant compensations that should 
signal a need to slow down on UC 
administrator pay increases.  
Without a pay raise, Khosla would 
certainly not go uncared for. UCSD 
has supplied him with an annual 
auto allowance of $8,916, a house 
near campus to host fundraising 
events, and $100,000 over the next 
four years to help with his relocation. 
This money is important for Khosla 
to uproot his family and move them 
across the country to settle down.

We hope to see Chancellor Khosla 
thrive here at UCSD, but let’s not 
hurry to give him a pay raise before 

Chancellor’s Salary Increase Signals Problem in Rising President Earnings

 



and wealthy who supposedly fuel the 
economy of the state.

Nonetheless, for those afraid 
that an increase in taxes will be too 
much of a burden on the 1 percent, 
remember this: The UC Regents 
are already planning to vote on a 6 
percent tuition hike come fall (before 
the election)  — another increase that 
would burden many families of all 
income levels across the state. If the 
UC system faces more cuts as a result 
of Brown’s tax initiative failing, then it 
can only get worse from here.

Given the grim depths of the state 
deficit, it’s no wonder that Brown has 
to take an ax to important programs. 
In the $91-billion state budget, the 
governor already made dramatic cuts 

to Medi-Cal, child welfare, disabilities 
benefits and the state court system. 
Frankly, it’s a miracle education has 
remained untouched. But if voters 
don’t approve this tax initiative in 
November, the cutting will only get 
more ugly.

Which begs the question: What 
can we afford to lose?

There’s the easiest target (and 
rightfully so): the justice system. 
Between 1982 and 2000, California’s 
prison system grew by 500 percent, 
and it has continued to grow since. 
Add the fact that each prisoner — 
including those jailed for peaceful 
drug offenses, gun ownership, or 
non-violent parole and probation 
violations — costs the state $50,000 
a year, it’s clear that we need some 

serious reform. Perhaps legalizing 
marijuana would be a good first step, 
even if Washington might resist.

The bottom line is that we’re in 
financial crisis. If such politically risky 
decisions do the job, then they’re well 
worth it. We just have to be more 
forward thinking here, rather than 
relying on the good ol’ standby of 
pressuring citizens come November. 
Regardless, voters need to know the 
consequences of voting “no” on the 
“Schools and Local Public Safety 
Protection Act of 2012.” It’s not just 
another tax increase; it’s a vote to 
preserve education as it stands now — 
which is, unfortunately, already pretty 
weak. But no matter what, someone 
will have to make a sacrifice in this 
budget battle. Nose goes.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 24,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Dear Editor,
In last week’s Thursday issue, 

a letter to the editor referring to J 
Street U at UCSD misrepresented 
both what our organization 
stands for and the actions we have 
taken in pursuit of an end to the 
occupation and a resolution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

Mr. Smith’s central issue seems 
to be that we don’t acknowledge the 
full reality of the occupation. 

This is a surprising charge 
given that our organization has 
hosted Uri Zaki, American Director 
of B’Tselem, the Israeli information 
center for human rights in the 
Occupied Territories and Abeer 
Natsheh and Shirly Coifman of 
OneVoice Palestine and Israel, 
who are building support for 
Palestinian self-determination in 
their respective societies — events 
that addressed the daily violations 
of human rights that make the 
occupation such a moral and 
political disaster for Israel, the U.S. 
and of course the Palestinians who 
live under it.

Mr. Smith goes on to charge 
that we don’t support a one-state 
resolution to the conflict. He 
is right. Mr. Smith would like 
to believe that this conflict is a 
simple story of right versus wrong, 
oppressor versus oppressed. 

It is not. While we acknowledge 
there is a power imbalance, it is 
a conflict between two legitimate 
national aspirations, two peoples 
who both claim the same land. 

And the loss and suffering 
on both sides is real. The only 
resolution, we believe, is one that 
grants a state to each people, a 
homeland in which they each can 
determine their own destiny.

This is also the only outcome, 
we believe, that can effectively end 
the occupation that Mr. Smith and 
we agree is so morally repugnant. 

We are organizing to end 
that occupation, and achieve 
a Palestinian state, by pushing 
our government to exercise its 
considerable power on behalf of 
justice. 

We have seen some gains to 
this effect, including our successful 
efforts in lobbying on behalf of 
funding for schools and hospitals in 
the West Bank. There is, of course, 
much work to do.

Succeeding in that work, we 
believe, requires building a broad 
base of support — among those 
who believe that both the Jewish as 
well as Palestinian people deserve 
a homeland. That’s why we tabled 
last week.  

And that’s why we’ll continue 
to reach out to those who want 
to recognize the claims of both 
peoples.

  Recognizing the aspirations 
and narratives of both Israelis 
and Palestinians is not a means of 
avoiding the issue, as Mr. Smith 
contends, but is rather the crucial 
first step to achieving freedom 
and security for all who live in the 
region.

I t’s common knowledge: Nothing � lls the emptiness of summer better than  perfectly cra� ed 
pop music, and every year, there’s 
that One Perfect Song — the one 
you’ll be jamming in your car for 

three months straight, forcing you 
through a cycle of love, hate and, 
� nally, total un� ltered addiction. 
And every year, music critics the 
world over try to guess which song 
it will be. 

Truthfully, there’s usually 
more than one “Song of Summer.” 
� ere’s your typical pop smash, a 
la “California Girls” or “Umbrella,” 
your indie breakthrough, a la 
“Pumped Up Kicks” or “Electric 
Feel,” and your hip-hop/R&B jam, a 
la “I’m On One” or “Hot In Herre.”

Which brings us to this summer. 
Here, for your consideration, are 
my personal submissions for the 
aforementioned categories. Some 
are contested, others are de� nitive, 
all are catchy as hell.

1. For this summer’s pop smash, 
I’m placing all my hopes on Usher. 
� e past few years were dominated 
by women — Katy Perry, Adele, 
Rihanna — but Usher is a summer 
pop mainstay (“Yeah” was ‘� e 
Song’ back in ‘04), and he has a few 
stellar singles under his belt going 
into June. Slow jam tour de force 
“Climax” and thunderous Rick 
Ross collaboration “Lemme See” 
are the better songs, but “Scream” 
� ts the Song of Summer formula 
to a T — the dance� oor banger of 
the bunch, not unlike past summer 
hit “O.M.G.” Written and produced 
by Max Martin, the mastermind 
behind many a hot weather 
smash, the track is like the perfect 
amalgamation of every club ready 
Usher hit, only faster, dirtier and 
way more fun.

2. In my perfect musical world, 
“I Love It” by Stockholm electro-
pop duo Icona Pop would become 
a massive hit and take the crown. 
First and foremost, it has a shout-
along chorus featuring lyrical 
gems  (“I put your shit into a bag 
and pushed it down the stairs / I 
crashed my car into the bridge, I 
don’t care”). Secondly, the track 
is pure maximalist electro ecstasy 
perfect for stumbling through a 
blackout rager. If it isn’t on your 
summer 2k12 playlist, you won’t be 
living it right.

But there’s some close 
contenders in this category. “All of 
Me” by Tanlines has more or less 
the same appeal: Exuberant synth 
you can imagine playing in the 
background of a backyard BBQ 
party, complete with a perfectly 
timed rise and fall — in essence, 
the bliss and nostalgia that go hand 
and hand with summertime. It’s the 
sound of seasonal love — or, at the 
very least, one good hookup.

� e second runner-up goes to 
“Hey Jane” by Spiritualized — a ‘90s

Dodging the

Dodging theDodging the            

Sunkissed 

Runaways

By Ren Ebel • Hiatus Editor

I f Wes Anderson’s legion of detractors can manage to bite their tongues, defend their cynical aversion to anything 
heartfelt and quirky and stubbornly 
claim that the director’s latest Hardy 
Boys-romance-comedy-adventure 
“Moonrise 
Kingdom” is 
simply pretentious 
� u� , then 
congratulations, 
you o�  cially have 
no soul.

For the rest of 
us, it’s time to get 
excited about going to the theatre.

“Moonrise Kingdom” takes place 
in the mid ‘60s (a perfect � t for 
Anderson’s nostalgic eye) on the 
� ctional island of New Penzance, 
o�  the coast of New England. � e 
� lm follows two wayward twelve-
year-olds — the orphan intellectual 
and expert outdoorsman Sam 
Shakusky (Jared Gilman), and the 
“troubled” fantasy novel loving, 

binocular-sporting Suzy Bishop 
(Kara Hayward) — who fall in love 
and decide to escape their cruel 
circumstances by running away 
together. 

� is quickly prompts an eclectic, 
island-wide search party consisting 

of Suzy’s bickering lawyer 
parents (Bill Murray and 
Frances McDormand), Sam’s 
Khaki Scout troop fronted 
by endearing Scout Master 
Randy Ward (Edward 
Norton) and the island’s lone 
police o�  cial, Captain Sharp 
(Bruce Willis). But when the 

children are found, and Sam’s rocky 
past is revealed, the island’s lovable 
bunch � nds a new common enemy 
in the stoic and impatient Social 
Services (Tilda Swinton), who aims 
to place Sam in an orphanage. 

� e script, which Anderson 
cowrote with “Darjeeling Limited” 
collaborator Roman Coppola, 
acts as an amalgam of the greatest 
aspects of his past � lms: the 

coming-of-age rebel/loner plight 
of “Rushmore,” the charismatic 
character study of “� e Royal 
Tenenbaums,” the stylized cartoon 
action of “� e Life Aquatic” and 
the smiling family-friendly heart of 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox.” � e product is 
a sort of micro-scale “Casablanca” 
starring a tween Bonnie and Clyde, 
with all the magic realism of Suzy’s 
young adult � ction.

Arguably for the � rst time, 
Anderson’s surreal Technicolor 
style and wry humor never upstages 
his attempts at bona � de drama 
or suspense, and o� en, one erupts 
straight from the other. A� er 
the troop’s search dog, Snoopy, 
is accidentally slain by an arrow 
following a violent confrontation 
with the Khaki Scout search party, 
Sam and Suzy solemnly stand over 
the body. “Was he a good dog?” she 
asks. “Who’s to say?” Sam replies 
with the stone-faced machismo of a 
turn-of-the-century war novel hero. 
“But he didn’t deserve to die.”

Not all of the � lm’s comedy lies 
in the mere fact that these children 
are acting like adults (and most 
of the adults, like children). � e 
ensemble bursts at the seams with 
perfectly-cast, singular characters 
— from Jason Schwartzman’s 
bizarro child smuggler/ordained 
minister Cousin Ben, to the 
immensely talented child actors 
that comprise Khaki Scout Troop 
55, to our badass and bespectacled 
protagonist, who resembles 
“Rushmore”’s iconic Max Fischer in 
more ways than one.

Surprisingly, Murray provides 
little of the � lm’s humor via his 
signature disgruntled deadbeat 
character (with the occasional 
subtle exception) — alternately 
delivering a tattered and real bu� er 
for the rest of the vibrant cast. 
Instead, this distinction goes to 
Willis and Norton, whose lovelorn 
police o�  cer Sharp and naive man-

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 24,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

A dmittedly, the notion of turning nostalgic, two-player guessing game 
“Battleship” into a mega-budget 
alien invasion blockbuster sounded 
like some joke spawned in the 
a� ermath of last year’s “Rock’em 
Sock’em Robots” movie.

But fear not. “Hancock” director 
Peter Berg’s 
“Battleship” 
doesn’t take 
itself nearly 
as seriously, 
opting 
instead for a 
straight-laced 
orgy of silly, 
entertaining action and special 
e� ects.

When hard-headed slacker Alex 
Hopper (Taylor Kitsch of “John 
Carter”) is tasered and arrested 
for breaking and entering a� er 
attempting to fetch a burrito for 
an attractive physical therapist 
named Samantha Shane (Brooklyn 
Decker), his brother Stone 
(Alexander Skarsgård) pushes 
him to enlist in the United States 
Navy. To add to the ridiculousness, 
it turns out Shane’s father is 
the notorious Admiral Shane, 

Commander of the Paci� c Fleet, 
played by Liam Neeson. 

Meanwhile, NASA has 
developed a transmission device 
a� er the discovery of a new earth-
like planet (“Planet G”), which 
leads us to the obvious truth that a 
modern Battleship movie couldn’t 
possibly settle for a modest “Top 
Gun”-at-sea war movie. Send in the 
menacing alien armada! 

As the scout alien infantry 
enters earth’s atmosphere, a recon 
ship is thrown o�  course and nearly 
wipes out Hong Kong. � e U.S. 
and Japan quickly put a half-baked 
political feud aside in order to � ght 
the alien foe. � e aliens’ initial 

attack leaves the U.S. and Japanese 
navy in shambles, with Hopper and 
SS John Paul Jones le�  to face the 
aliens, separated from the rest of 
the � eet by a dome-like force � eld. 

While “Battleship” delivers 
seemingly non-stop action, the 
utter lack of character development 
is di�  cult to overlook. Barbadian 
pop-star Rihanna makes her big-
screen debut, and seems she can 
only shoot big guns at aliens and 
shout brief, mindless exclamations 
toward her male-dominant cast.

But the extensive CGI battle 
scenes are impressive. With 
monumental alien warships 
reminiscent of Michael Bay’s 

“Transformers” and the intricate 
use of tsunami buoys to detect 
enemies re� ect a decent amount 
thought. � e most memorable 
moment arrives at the climax of 
the alien invasion: the U.S. Navy is 
le�  shipless and with the last resort 
of manning a � oating battleship 
museum o�  the coast of Pearl 
Harbor. 

At its core, however, “Battleship” 
is dopey, preposterous and 
unintentionally hilarious in all the 
wrong places. It’s also explosive and 
fast paced enough that summer 
audiences with a high tolerance for 
stupidity and low expectations will 
likely � nd it a worthwhile zone-out.

‘Moonrise Kingdom’ is a Nostalgic Triumph
boy Scout Master Randy Ward are 
true Anderson originals, as well as 
delightfully atypical roles for both 
actors. 

Despite their on-screen 
con� dence, the romance seems like 
a tough sell for the young leads 
at � rst — not that it particularly 
matters amidst the ingenious script 
and almost overwhelming mise-en-
scene. But as the couple’s adventure 
presses on, their clunky, yet sincere 
chemistry only contributes to 
their naive, confused and wholly 
realistic charm. It makes for a less-
calculated approach for Anderson 
— further aided by his warm and 
grainy 16mm � lm — that imbues 

this world with a spellbinding 
adolescent purity. When Sam says, 
“I love you, but you don’t know 
what you’re talking about,” and Suzy 
replies with a tender, “I love you 
too” we forget for moment what age 
these kids are, let alone the fact that 
they’re acting. By the time we’re 
dancing beachside with Sam and 
Suzy midway through (and what a 
batshit genuine dance it is), we’re 
as convinced and in love as the two 
of them.

Of course, “Moonrise Kingdom” 
also delivers Anderson’s trademark 
fare. � ere’s an excellent soundtrack 
punctuated by Leonard Bernstein’s 
“A Young Person’s Guide to the 
Orchestra” and Françoise Hardy’s 
sensual “Le Temps de l’Amour” for 

the aforementioned dance scene. 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox” composer 
Alexandre Desplat delivers a 
natural and relatively unassuming 
score, and yes, there’s one awesome 
slo-mo scene toward the end.

But Anderson’s best moments 
have always been when he’s 
managed to transcend the sum of 
his manicured and monumental 
parts, sparking glimpses of 
beautiful, heartbreaking magic.

“Moonrise Kingdom” 
accomplishes this from start to 
� nish. It’s an incredibly indulgent 
adventure masterpiece without an 
ounce of arrogance, it’s a godsend 
for the auteur’s cult fans and it’s 
Wes Anderson’s best � lm to date.

ALBUM REVIEWS

R egina Spektor knows she’s good. While most artists struggle to capture just one 
sound, Spektor, a singer-songwriter 
and a classically trained pianist, 
is totally comfortable navigating 
diverse styles. �is impressive 

range is on full display throughout 
her new album, What We Saw 
From �e Cheap Seats. She shi�s 
e�ortlessly from playful pop tunes 
to slow, mournful ballads, always 
accompanied by her piano.

Even on individual tracks, 
Spektor refuses to stick to one 
template. On “Oh Marcello,” 
Spektor fakes an Italian accent 
while pseudo-covering Nina 
Simone’s “Don’t Let Me Be 
Misunderstood,” mixing in 
irreverent, yet playful staccato and 
�nally mimicking a kick drum. 
Rather than overwhelm the listener, 
Spektor’s antics communicate an 
exuberance that makes listening 
to her like watching a kid proudly 

show you all her favorite toys.
On the dark, introspective 

“Open,” Spektor achieves an 
entirely di�erent e�ect. As the 
piano slows and so�ens, Spektor 
starts whispering. Suddenly, her 
voice rises to a crescendo, each 
word punctuated by a guttural gasp. 
�e e�ect is haunting.

But the true testament to 
Spektor’s musical ability is that, 
despite the vast array of styles 
she uses, the project never seems 
jumbled. Instead, it hangs together 
as a rather charming exhibit of 
Regina Spektor’s versatility.

freaky with the folk band Feathers. 
But the “King” is where his true heart 

lies.  
Tu�’s 2008 debut Was Dead, 

contained standouts like “Sun 
Medallion” in which he croons about 
hanging out in a graveyard wearing 
his favorite thri�-store necklace, or 
“Freak When I’m Dead” in which he 
contemplates his a�er-life wardrobe 
and doesn’t care what his grandma 
thinks about it.

His self-titled sophomore e�ort 
is �omas’ most straightforward 
and genuine album yet. Like the 
soundtrack to “Almost Famous,” King 
Tu� is full of feel-good, no frills rock 
‘n roll songs. �e �rst track “Anthem” 
is just that — a track that asserts the 
album in classic Beatles-esque fashion.  

“Alone and Stoned” begins so� 
and wistful but jumps right back up 

as a catchy pop rock song that’s easy 
to bop around to. �e album’s brief 
single “Bad �ing” is silly, loose, 
fun and with a proper hook, where 
�omas’ voice sounds like a cross 
between the happy-go-lucky pop 
sound of Weezer’s River Cuomo and 
the whiny, scrappier vocals of Black 
Francis of �e Pixies.

His relocation to Los Angeles from 
Vermont is apparent on this sunny 
album. Whoever Kyle �omas may 
be in�uenced by, or whatever he has 
worked on has all accumulated into 
the person he is today and King Tu� is 
his most solid, genuine piece of work 
yet.

A �er a brief foray into more structured pop music, Icelandic-based Sigur Ros has 
�nally returned to the shimmering 
soundscapes they captured so well 
in their early albums. �eir latest 
release, Valtari, is another beautiful 
e�ort, gently swelling and subsiding, 
with frontman Jonsi’s falsetto 
soaring above piano, strings and so� 

electronic textures. It’s not catchy, 
but it’s easy music to sink into.

In fact, Valtari is even less 
structured than the group’s 1999 
classic Ágætis byrjun. On that album, 
Sigur Ros made their name with 
ethereal combinations of classical 
strings and aching melodies, 
all covered in bowed guitar and 
stretched out to such lengths that 
no song felt rushed. �ough you 
can’t understand a single word 
(and some of the songs aren’t even 
in any language), it’s easy to hum 
along — the songs are too grand, 
too glorious, that you just can’t help 
yourself.

Valtari draws on the same 
feeling, but instead of songs building 
to towering heights, the songs gather 
a little momentum, then draw back. 
�e album blends together nicely, 

reaching its modest peak on only 
the third track “Varúð,” then slowly 
falling away until all that’s le� is 
a haunting piano solo in “Fjögur 
Píanó” (which may translate to 
“Four Pianos”). �ough as incredible 
as ever, Jonsi’s voice isn’t the focus 
on this album. In fact, by the time 
you’ve reached the title track in the 
second half of the album, Jonsi has 
stopped singing altogether.

�ere’s a lot less happening on 
Valtari than on its predecessors, but 
it works to the band’s advantage. 
�ough their recent music’s 
�irtation with pop music has been 
enjoyable, it’s good to see Sigur 
Ros revisiting their strengths in a 
compelling way.

Female Rappers Dominate Summer Playlist
Rain, Crooked Rain-era Pavement. 
Make it your road trip soundtrack.

3. For the hip-hop end of the 
spectrum, the competition is really 
between two women — one up-
and-coming and one full-blown 
phenomenon. So, obviously, Azealia 
Banks and Nicki Minaj.

 Banks would have this entire 
thing in the bag if she had released 
“212” in April, but her new single 
“Jumanji” is promising. �e beat 
is lighthearted and her rhymes are 
delightfully bratty (“Real bitch, 
everyday / Uptown, Broadway”). �e 
drum-heavy production is absolutely 
surprising throughout, quickly 
�ipping from tropical steel-pan to 
booming bass drums while Banks 
does her usual sassy thing in the 
background.

Minaj’s “Beez In the Trap,” on the 

other hand, does a lot more with a 
lot less. Where “Jumanji” is all about 
the boisterous production, making 
the actual rapper less of the focus, 
“Beez in the Trap”  — with its sunken, 
minimal beat — makes Minaj the 
rightful star, weaving her schoolgirl 

stingers around every inch of the 
track. Girls will memorize the words 
just so they can join in the smack talk.

But, unfortunately, “Call Me 
Maybe” and Justin Bieber will likely 
dominate the radio this summer. If 
you play these instead, I salute you.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 24,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — It was announced 
last week that six Tritons picked up 
All-West Region awards — junior cen-
ter�elder Danny Susdorf, sophomore 
shortstop Garrett Tuck, sophomore 
utility Nick La Face, sophomore third 
baseman Sam Michaels and pitchers 
Ryan Goodbrand and Tony York.

Selections were based on polls 
conducted by three outlets — the 
American Baseball Coaches Associa-
tion, the National Collegiate Baseball 
Writers Association and Daktronics.

Susdorf, a junior transfer from the 
University of San Diego, was named 
to the All-West Region First team by 
all three organizations for the second 
straight year. �e junior leado� hitter 
leads the Tritons in batting average 
(.393), runs (51), hits (84), stolen bases 
(25) and slugging percentage (.556).

Sophomores Garrett Tuck and 
Nick La Face both garnered Regional 
honors for the �rst time in their col-
legiate careers. Tuck — batting in the 
two-hole for the Tritons — boasts the 
second best batting average (.362), 77 
hits in 213 at-bats.

La Face leads the Tritons in two-

baggers with 17. For his performance 
at the CCAA �nals, the catcher/utility 
was named the tournament’s Most 
Outstanding Player. Junior transfer 
Sam Michaels earned third team 
honors and ABCA All-West Region 
Golden Glove recognition.

Senior closer Tony York — named 
to the All-West Region second team 
— will leave his mantle as UCSD’s 
best closer. �e senior righthander is 
2-1 this season in his 24 appearances, 
logging a 2.1 ERA — the lowest in the 
Triton bullpen. Fellow pitcher junior 
Ryan Goodbrand was picked for the 
First Team. �e starter �nished the 
season with a perfect 11-0 record, 
allowing just 82 hits in his 99.1 innings 
while notching 69 strikeouts.

�e UCSD Baseball team ended 
their season last weekend, in the West 
Region Finals. With a 33-24 overall re-
cord, the Tritons captured their fourth 
CCAA regular season title as well as 
their fourth straight CCAA tourna-
ment title to qualify for the NCAA 
Division II National tournament. �e 
Tritons were eliminated a�er three 
games, falling twice to Dixie State.

Six Tritons Earn All-
West Region Awards

Okay, it’s probably not fair to equate a UCSD softball player with a veteran, but 
for the Tritons’ performance at last 
weekend’s Division II College World 

Series, the squad has received a not-
so surprising lack of recognition.

Granted, their second place 
finish fell short of last season’s 
national championship, but by how 
much?

The Tritons traded last season’s 
regular season title for a CCAA 
tournament championship. 

By the numbers: The Tritons 
conceded 10 more losses this season 
than the last, going 45–23 in 2012 
and 45–13 in 2011, tieing for the 
most single-season wins in program 
history. 

But what made the difference 

between first and second place?
Well, firstly, I’ll concede that in a 

game so much dependent on chance, 
there’s arguably no difference. 

But for the sake of argument, let’s 
review the discrepancies. 

UCSD’s three most consistent 
batters in 2011 were absent this 
season. 

Two of them — third baseman 
Sarah Woofter and first baseman 
Jennifer De Fazio — graduated 
in 2011, while left-hander Esther 
Strom wasn’t in the dugout in 2012

The hole in the lineup has largely 
been filled by freshmen Monique 
Portugal and Maria Sykes, who both 
played in over 50 games this season. 

Further, sophomore Caitlin 
Brown’s transformation from 
reliable base hitter to power player 
along with senior All-American 
Kris Lesovsky’s continued threat in 
the box, has made 2012’s squad one 
of the best in the country. 

But still, there’s a discrepancy 
between last year’s offensive 
numbers and this season’s.

In 2011, UCSD recorded 279 
runs in their 58 games (4.81 runs 
per game), while this season the 
Tritons mustered only 262 in 68 
games (3.85 runs per game). 

Their on-base percentage is 
down from .374 to .361, while their 
slugging and fielding percentages 
are largely the same. 

I’m no statistician and I only half-
understood “Moneyball” — though 
I wish I was Jonah Hill’s character 
so that I could pal around with Brad 

Pitt and graduate from Harvard 
with honors — so I wouldn’t dare 
point to one thing that definitely 
made the difference between this 
year and last. 

But if I had a gun pointed to my 
head, I would have to say pitching.

Graduating senior Camille Gaito 
— two-time All-American, two-
time All-West Region selection, 
two-time All-CCAA — will leave 
UCSD with her name fixed in the 
record books for years to come. 

But where she was unhittable last 
year, this year she was, just, barely, 
noticeably, not as good. 

In 2011, Gaito’s ERA was an 
unbelievable 0.75, making her 
unmistakably the best in Division II. 

This season, she allowed just a 
smidge over one run a game.

As I would like to reiterate, 
it’s hardly a significant change, 
but against this season’s Division 
II champion Valdosta State — 
averaging 6.57 runs a game, 
boasting a .562 slugging percentage 
and 62 season home runs — just 
the slightest difference could be the 
decider.

Gaito took the mound for the 
Tritons in UCSD’s last 17 games— 
nearly all of the postseason— which 
included back-to-back 11 inning 
games followed by a nine-inning 
win that led into the Tritons’ last 
two matches of the tournament.

Moral of the story? 
Maybe you can’t win two 

back-to-back titles with just one 
arm.

SPOTLIGHT ON
INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIERS

NICK HOWE
The UCSD Track & Field 

captain will look to capture his 
third NCAA Division II National 

title this week in Colorado.
“I am very honored to be here for 

another go around,” Howe said. “It seems 
like I was just at this meet as a little 

freshman and now I’m sitting on top of the 
pack.” 

Howe — four-time CCAA Champion in 
the javelin — took home his first title as a 
sophomore, breaking the school record with a 
throw of 225’. Howe followed up with another 
title in 2011 to take his second title with his 
longest throw-to-date at 231.3’.

Howe will be throwing this Saturday, May 
26 at 11:15 a.m.

JACKIE ROSE
UCSD has a strong tradition of exceptional 

female sprinters. This season, senior Jackie 
Rose takes over the mantle as UCSD’s fastest 

female. 
Rose, who competed at the NCAAs as a 

sophomore as part of the 4x400 meter team 
alongside Sri Lankan Olympian Christine 
Merrill, will be making her second ever 
appearance.

Rose is the only Triton to have qualified 
for multiple events at the meet — competing 
in the 200m, 400m and 4x400m competitions.

Rose will anchor the 4x400m team, 
who ran their best race at the Cal/Nevada 
Championships, clocking in at 3:49.89.

KA WAI NG
The Hong Kong national broke the school 

record in his first season of NCAA competition 
last season, but not in the triple jump, in the 
100m — posting a 10.74 time in the CCAA 
Championships.

This season, Ng has broken the school 
record in the triple jump on at least two 
occasions this season.

Ng’s furthest mark to date is 50’5.5”, a jump 

which won him the CCAA Championship.
“The other guys are all on my level, all 

around a foot of each other,” Ng said. “They 
may be a bit better, but it all comes down to 
who hits a jump on Saturday.”

JESSICA MIKLASKI
All-American Jessica Miklaski will be 

making her second appearance at the NCAA 
Division II Championships, where she will 
look to improve on last season’s sixth place 
finish in the javelin event.

In the past two years, the San Diego native 
took back-to-back second place finishes at the 
CCAA Championships.

Miklaski’s longest throw to date is 138’1”.
“It would be great to get in the top three,” 

Miklaski said. “I guess its kinda cool to come 
in the same seed as last year, last, so there’s 
no pressure and I’m comfortable in familiar 
territory.”
