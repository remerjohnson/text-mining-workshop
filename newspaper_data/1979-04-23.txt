Irvine's Paper Loses AS Funding 
By Cindy Beveridge 

Photographs of a woman's 
wet T-shirt contest and alleged 
ethnic slurs published in UC 
Irvi ne' s student newspa per, the 
new Uni versity , led to student 
government withdrawal of the 
paper's funds earlier this 
month. 

The surprise action, taken 
April 3, passed the Irvine 
Council by an 18-7 vote. The 
remaining $10,000 of the $20,000 
yearly allotment for the new 
Universit y was withdrawn 
from the paper. 

A week later the AS decided 
to reimburse the paper for all 
but $500, which will be used to 
sponsor a new paper for next 

year called Unipress. Pro-
ceedings to "oust" editor 
Richard Clucas were dropped 
as well. 

The dispute began last 
January with the publication of 
photos of the wet T-shirt 
competition at a bar in Santa 
Ana . The photographs were 
labeled "sexist" by AS vice 
president Karen Bjornby , who 
says she helped destroy 
hundreds of the newpaper . 

Successive editions of the 
pa per included sat irica l 
advertisements titled " Live 
and Play in Iran," which a 
group of Iranian students found 
insulting. Further conflict 
arose when the group's written 

response to the paper was 
never printed on the editorial 
page. 

Occasional disapproval 
became outright protest with 
the March publication of a 
satirical pape,r mocking ' 
various aspects of campus life 
at UCI. The AS re ponded by 
cutting the new University ' 
funds . 

The Council's original 
demands, including an apology 
to the Iranians and the creation 
of a nondi crimination policy 
concerning editorial , were 
al 0 dropped. 

Member Dan Levin on, who 
is currently running for AS 
executive vice president , 

explained this decision by 
stating that "no one wants to 
use the paper as a political tool. 
We feel previous issues were 
in poor taste but everyone 
wants to see the new University 
continue. " 

A subsequent meeting of the 
Communications Board 
suggested the paper volun-
tarily appropriate $1700 for the 
Real University, an alternative 
paper which began publication 
during the controversy. 

"The AS would probably 
have taken the money from us 
anyway. By giving it to them 
ourselves we avoided another 
conflict," Managing Editor 
Beth Blenz sa id. Blenz also 

suggested the Council's 
reversal was motivated in part 
by the paper's role in covering 
the upcoming ASUCI elections. 

Student body reaction to the 
new University dispute has 
been mixed. 

One student finds the ordeal 
confusing. " I can't understand 
why everyone is so upset about 
a paper that was supposed to 
make you laugh. A lot of the 
satirical articles were really 
crude a~d unnecessary, but you 
have to -take them in the light 
they were written," he said. 

In March the new University 
received second place Cor 
" general excellence" of weekly 
papers, statewide.

Townhouses-Open in Fall 
Sufficient Housing to be Available 

By Wayne Hunt 
Staff Writer 

Despite heavy winter rains, 
construction of the new Third 
and Warren townhouses should 
be completed by the end of this 
August, according to Auxiliary 
Enterprises Director Larry 
Barrett. 

Upon completion of the 
townhouses, " there will be 
sufficiept space on ·campus to 
house those students who we 
feel we must house," said 
Barrett. 

compliance with the univer-
sity's " freshmen first" policy , 
according to Valerie Tavares, 
acting resident dean of Third . 
She added that sufficient room 
will be available for incoming 
freshmen. 

Revelle students will be 
allotted space at the town-
houses because their college 
does not offer apartment space 
and because they have housed 
Warren students in the past, 
according to Barrett. 

married students next year. 
The design of the townhouses 

is identical to the Mesa 
apartments and will be one-
level units- instead of the two-
level tructure of Third 's 
present townhouses, Barrett 
said. 

The total cost of the 
townhouse project is estimated 
at $6 million. according to 
university arc hitect Don 
McCardy. The project is funded

Glider Port May-
Need Permit to 
Stay Open 

By Teresa Tokl\,r 
Starr Writer 

Concern ovel' the afety of the 
UCSD gliderport may result in 
a state airport permit if the 
State Department of Transpor-
tation (Cal Trans) has it way. 

Recently Cal Tran sent a 
letter to Chancellor William 
McElroy requesting that the 
university obtain a permit. 

McElroy sair1 , " we're having 
legal counsel look into (the 
university ' li abilities) " 
becau e UCSD must know what 
need to be done to make the 
port safe. However, McElroy 
said that if CSD cannot alford 
the needed improvements the 
administration will have no 
choice but to close the port. 

Ann Grant , public informa-
tion officer for Cal Trans , said 
the state requires that the 
gliderport operate with a sta te 
airport permit , but this 
requirement ha not been 
enforced in the past because the 
gliderport, located just north of 
the Salk Institute, is in a emi-
remote area and the amount of 
traffic there has not been great 
in the past. 

However, in recent years 
hang gliders and radio-

copt-rolled model aircra ft have 
also begun to use .the port in 
addition to the gliderplanes. 

John Croghan, San Diego 
airporL manager, said that 
allowing 0 many objects to 
operate in a certain area 
without a central control is 
.. inviting an accident. It's 
better to look into the situation 
before someone gets hurt, 
rather than as the result of an 
accident. " 

Grant agr ed that th~volume 
of traffic at the port poses a 
danger . It is Cal Trans' 
responsibility to reque t that 
the university apply for a state 
permit, Grant said, adding that 
Cal Trans ha done this m any 
times ince 1969 but has 
received no response from the 
universi ty. 

Grant said the university 
would be financially respon-
sible for any needed safety 
equipment that the gliderport 
might need if a permit were 
obtained. 

McElroy said that obtaining 
a permit would have to be a 
joint effort between the 
university .and the city of San 
Diego. The port's takeoff strip

consisting of 150 apartments ' 
housing a total of 600 students, 
will accommodate students 
from Warren and Third who in 
the past were placed in Muir or 
Revelle housing because of 
insufficient housing space, 
according to Barrett. 

He added that students who 
cannot be accommodated at the 
new townhouses will be 
absorbed by the Revelle and 
Muir campuses. 

Groundworks Hit Second Time 

Increa ed enrollments at 
Third and Warren also 
necessita ted the const ruction of 
additional housing, he said. 
According to Barrett, the 
number of students entering 
the two colleges is rising faster 
than at Muir or Revelle. 

Incoming freshmen will have 
firs t priority or residenthll 
Spares at the townhouses in 

Muir, however, may be 
reluctant to help house 
remaining Thi rd students 
because it already has its own 
upurtments and does not need 
to trude housing with Third, 
Barrett remal'ked. 

Due to the increased number 
of spaces for on -c ampu 
housing, the Mesa apartments 
will be used us a "safety vulve" 
to handle any overflow of Third 
students not housed by the 
townhouses next veur,

that Mesa will primarily house 

In the second such attack in 
less than a month, vandels

Opinion 

Trade: Hut for Home 
Takeover of McElroy's House Like Hut Conversion 

Chancellor McElroy: into a faculty lounge. You 
consider the two major 
contentions (or revam~ing our 
Corcee 'Hut to be the fact that it 
has been losing money, and that 
the UCSD faculty needs a place 
to socialize. We consider that 
the student fees used to ' 
establish and maintain the 
Coffee Hut justify our 
continued staffing and 
mealcard options there, After 
all, it is the onty dining facility 
secluded from the rest of the 
campus with a unique setting 
and atmosphere different from 
that of the cafeterias. 

Granted, our analogy of your 
house as a student center is 
ridiculous, but it onl~ parallels 

your anti·student sentiments. 
But on second thought , if we ' 
absurdly co-opt your house , it 
might force the development of 
communication and camera-
derie that should exist between 
the Chancellor and the students 
that attend this university. 
Pardon us if we ' re mistaken, 
but is not the function of the 
Chancellor to be here for the 
benefit and support of the 
stodents rather than to 
disregard student opinion and 
detract from the entire campus

Letters to the Editor 

Sex Counselors 
Push Own Values 

Editor: 
It is curious that The 

Guardian ran the article on 
"Sex on Campus" (April 11) 
under the heading "Science" 
instead o{ " Opinion." The 
article consisted of little except . 
subjective comments filled 
with value judgements by so-
called "counselors " Hugh 
Pates and Sharon Keating. 

Pates and Keating are 
reported as maintaining that 
"it's as natural as sleeping" or 
eating ... "sex is not something 
which should be treated any 
diCCerent from other bodily 
needs and functions ." This is 
clearly . an opinion which 
ignores the obvious scientific 
fact that normal sexual 
intercourse requires two 
individuals and has as its 
natu ra I bioi ogica I conse-
quences conception , preg-
nancy, and children. 

Strangely, while Pates and 
Keating imply that sex is good 
because it is natural , they 
spend most of their (Regis-
tration Fee funded) time 
promoting such unnatural 
interventions as contraception 
anCl abortion, Presumably, 
they have determined that the 
imperfections of nalure are 
such that "good" sex can lead 
to "bad" consequences . 

This contradiction cannot be 
logically or scientifically 
sustained: it is possible only 
through reference to a system 
of value judgments. One would 
suspect that Pates and Keating 
believe that instantaneous selC-
gratification is ' the ultimate 

good (Hedonism), in which 
case sexual activity (with 

. oneself. partners of either sex , 
or animals) can be viewed as 
recreation. 

Science does not support this: 
beyond a doubt the purpose of 
sex is procreation . In fact , 
evolutionary theory would 
point to the conclusion that all 
other bodily functions (eating , 
sleeping, even thinking) have 
developed as secondary 
activities contributing to the 1 propagattoq of the specjes, 

This , science and logic 
contradict Pates' a nd 
Keating's assessment of sex 
and establish the same point as 
traditional religion: sexual 
intercourse is different {rom 
other bodily functions because 
it involves two individuals in 
the creation of new human life. 
How one treats sex must 
necessarily develop from the 
ethical imperatives of this 
creativity, not from science or 
medical technology . 

If you have been misled on 
this point by Pates and Keating 
or their cohorts in the campus' 
(Reg Fee funded) Counseling 
and Psychology Corps, you 
should attend a showing of 
"The First Days of ~ife" on 
Tuesday , May 1 (7: 30 pm and 9 
pm). The Human Life 
Committee is presenting this 
scientific film on fet ,ll 
development to emphasize the 
sanctity of human life and the 
moral bankruptcy of recre-
ational sex backed by abortion, 

Don S&rebel 

ID relards to your plans for 
the Coffee Hut Coup de Faculte 
- 'We are offeriq what we 
consider to be a viable 
excbanle: you use the Coffee 
Hut as a faculty clubhouse, and 
we'll sacrifice our interests 
there and pre-empt your house 
as an orr-~ampus student 
activity center, We have drawn 
up some plans to facilitate the 
process of making your house 
our home. They include thel 
installation of jacuzzi. sauna 
and ample S-status parking in 
the front yard, with tennis 
courts and co-ed cabanas in the 
back , These are just the 
preliminaries . Long-range 
plans include barspace and 
dance floors (or sunset TGIF's, 
and a new Glider Port equipped 
with elevators providing access 
to and from the beach. 

But seriously, we, as a 
representational sector of 
students residing at UCSD, feel 
that our reasons for main-
taining the Coffee Hut as a 
student-founded, student-
staffed and student-oriented 
facility far outweigh your 
justifications for converting it 

Center Fee Story Set. Straight_ 
Editor: 

[ want to set the record 
straight on the Student Center 
Fee question. You are right in 
reporting that the Unive~ity 
could not collect the additional 
fee without great expense and 
thus asked for a year's delay.

Chancellor McElroy offered, in 
writing, to make up any loss 

. incurred at the end of the year. 
The audit showed that 
additional funds were not 
needed. The director · of the 
Student Center wanted $39,000, 
The Chancellor agreed to 
reimburse the noard in the 
3mount of $20 ,000 even though 

this was contrary to the written 
agreement. This money was 
received last fall. 

Your error stems from 
confusing the allocation with 
the Chancellor'S later offer ' to 
help fund capital expense' of the 
new pllb in the amount of 
$20,000. The net result is that 
students got relief for ont! year 

from paying the increased fee 
and the Chancellor has 
encumbered his discretionary 
funds in the amount of $40,000. 
This is money which students 
can spend without increasing 
their own fees.

that the San Onofre turbine -

hi,hway is extremely dan-
,.rous, "Millions of people 
travel on that freeway, 
including school buses," she 
laid. "These people don't 
realize how much their health is 
in jeopardy, .. 

Burtell stated, "The public's 
been IOld a bad story on

that eve'n though officials said 
the amount of radiation being 
emitted was equal to that of a 
dental x-ray , " people aren't 
exposed to a dental x-ray every 
hour for 24 hours for three potential radiation damage 

from the power plants." She 
added, "We've been assured 
that we're safe from the two 
worst effects of radiation : 
death from cancer and genetic 
disease," However, according 
to Burtell , what the industry 
doesn't say is that people are 
not safe from ill health caused 
by the regular radiation 

emissions from the plants. 
Burtell said "ill health" 

includes asthma , learning 
disabilities and non-malignant 
tumors all caused by radiation. 
Burtell said people will also be 
affected with diseases common 
to old age such as heart disease 
and arthritis . " People won ' t 
necessarily die sooner, they ' ll 
become old at a younger age, .. 

she said. 
Any damage done to a 

person 's body can also affect 
sperm and egg cells. Minor 
diseases and afflictions carry 
over into the next generation, 
according to Burtell. "We' ll 
soon be a nation full of people 
with ill health ," she warned. 

Burtell also commented on 
the Harrisburg incident saying 

weeks." 
The effect of radiation on the 

Ha rrisburg citizens will be 
difficult to measure because 
the sta te of the community 's 
health before the incident 
wasn't known, said Burtell. 

Rudia tion standards set in 
1954 by the In ternalional 
Atomic Energy Agency have 
not changed. Damage c(.lusing 
ill hea lth is not considel'ed 
dangerous. The partici p,wts in 
the Agency are se lected by the 
government a nd the sta ndards

scientists can ' t attend or

noted Burtell. 

A few workers Crom the plant

Flake, an electrician in San

"too many oC us don't know

Baseball Team Olit of League Race 
By Jon Halperin 

The Triton baseball team 
won just one of their four 
contests last week as their 
record fell to 13-21. Thirteen 
wins, however, is the highest 
for a UCSD baseball squad in 
recent years. Unfortunately, 
the Triton fell out of the league 
race. 10sinR three games to the 

drew another walk, advanced 
to second on a groundout by 
Brett Sandstrom, stole third 
and scored on a single by Pat 
McGovern. McGovern then . 
later scored on a double by Bob 
Vaage. 

The Tritons added one more 
in the firth and then three in the 
eighth. McGovern picked up his 

runs to score in the third as a 
single got past him, allowine a 
runner to get into scoring 
position. 

In the fifth , Rob Gramme 
mishandled a ground ball at' 
shortstop, opening the door for 
two more USIU runs. 

The Tritons scored three in 
the second, one in the fourth 

,A fter Sgueaker 

and one in the fifth as Jim 
Moffat , John Dickenson , 
Sharpe and Gramme delivered 
run scoring hits . The team 
played well but in the words of 
coach Vince Askey, lost the 
game on "stupid errors." 

USIU 6, UCSD 0 
Tom Nicholson fell behind ' 

early in the game while the 

offense could not capitalize on 
scoring opportunities. in a 
losing effort in the second 
game. 6-0. 

The Western'ers scored three 
in the first on a bases loaded 
triple. Two more runs were 
added in the second to put the 
game out of reach, 5-0. 

Tired 'Netmen Trampled 
Playing two tennis matches 

in one day is not the easiest 
assignment. as Coach Tad 
Yamaguchi and the men's 
tennis team found out last 
Saturday afternoon in their 
travels to the north. 

The first match against 
Cia remon t -Mudd went 
smoothly enough w,ith the 
netters squeaking by their 
NCAA rivals. 5-4. A smoggy 
afternoon contest against 
University of Redlands did not 
turn out well, as the tired 
Tritons were tromped by a 
fresh Redlands team, 1-8. 

Four of the team ' s five points 
against Claremont-Mudd came 
in singles competition, as the 
Tritons led 4-2 going into -the 
doubles matches. Paul Metsch,

AS Presidential Candidates 

BARRY HYMAN 
I am running for ASUCSD President 

so that students can have an effective 
student government committed to their 
interests for a change. In the past, the 
ASUCSD Presidency has become a 
dynasty of sorts, a hand picked elite 
passing authority to one another, each 
progressively less capable and 
increasingly unwilling to work on behalf 
of students. I mean to change that. 

Through my work as Student Welfare 
Commissioner, I have supported 
students and organizations through 
bureaucratic battles that hinder and 
render innefectual the hearts and minds 
of the student body! I established 
UCSD's Student Advocate Program to 
help students shafted by the University in 
academics, housing, finaOclal aid, etc ... 

We students have always been on the 
outside of UCSO's decision making 
process, excluded from it. This must 
change. When half the students in a 
course are failed in the name of some 
inane curve, or good teachers are denied 
tenure, we mu~t not sit idly by or we will 
be trampled upon. UCSD, whether 
intentionaly or not, erodes our 
individuatity, our very love. We must 
make our voices heard, our perspectives 
accounted for. In general that is my 
philosophy towards UCSO. 

More !p!Cifically, myself and the other 
Common Sense slate members work for 
election of Regents by legislative district; 
voting rights on Academic Senate 
committees relating to curric.,dum and 
tenure; student control of food services; 
more funds for student organizations 
and media; revision of the ASUCSD 
Constitution, etc ... 

Vote Barry Hyman for ASUCSD 
President. it's only Common Sense! 

I , ., ,' )" CA~LOS' MONTALVO 
Since the campaign began, students 

have asked me why I am running, so ... 
this is as good a place to start as any. 

My main reason for running for AS 
office is because I see the ASUCSD as 
the only mechanism by which students 
can achieve a college community. 
Seventy percent of all incoming 
freshmen transfer before their senior 
year. High attrition is not a problem at 
UCSD, it is a sympton. Most of the 
relationships that arise at UCSD are 
competitive ones. Students feel 
threatened by students, the faculty by 
the administration, the coUege system by 
the university system. 

Before political buzz works like 
"tenure" or "democratization of the 
Regents" can be promised, th~ 
candidates must deal with the obvious: 
support of the Student Co·ops, support 
of our college system, maximizing the 
use of the Student Center, full voting 
privileges on all academic committees, 
departmental organization - i.e. student 
needs, not political ideolO<JV. 

Throughout the campaign 1 have been 
taking the issues directly to the students; 
pseudonyms and media overkill are not 
effective ways of enhancing student 
communication. AS AS Commissioner of 
Public Relations, AS rep to the Day Care 
Info Board and the Editor of. the 
ASUCSD BuUetin, I have provided both 
leadership and direction to the AS 
Council. Moreover, I can offer students 
something most other candidates have 
overlooked - the efforts of a team. 

It is crucial that students vote , apathy 
only encourages them. I ask for your 
support. Vote Carlos Montalvo -
ASUCSD President. 

JEREMY CHARLTON 
Hello, I am Jeremy Charlton. ' I am 

running for President of the -AS. This 
position has always been controUed in a 
most silly manner. I therefore promise I 
will be even sillier than 1 need be if 
elected. Coherency is an integral 
platform I like blackboard dust effect 
now then. As leader of the Saly Student 
Organization I have learned many of the 
skills necessary to run UCSD. I promise 
that I will not use my position for my own 
personal gain, for example, some have 
aUeged that I am running for President so 
that I can later go into National politics, 
this is somewhat untrue. I would also like 
to deny the fact that I am a paranoid-
schizophrenic. 

DO NOT be fooled by other 
candidates' last desperate attempts to 
appear silly. there is only one silly slate 
and we've always been silly. Certainly 
long before the other candidates began 
posturing for public office. I am confident 
that you, the students, will recognize us 
as truly silly and the other candidates as 
mere imitations. -

DAN GOOKIN 

Hello, my name is Dan Gookin and I 
am running for the position of Vice 
PNsident. IIepre88nt no slate nor am I 

Mth any on·campus group or 

I ~. that you wiD find ~ an 
effective leader and one that is "fun ..... 
but seeing that most of you don't vote,l 
won't give a '$Y: about you. . 

Ah, yes, my stand on the issues. Well, 
by aurveying a large portion of the 
population 01 the student body here (6), I 
have come upon the conclusion that the 
issues, • they ... mentioned, suck. A lot 
of you don't ~ a damn about the 
issues. I don't either. 

I feel that the real issue in everyone's 
head is why this school is so ~ing 
dull. Nothing ever happens here. College 
is the last "free" moment in anyone's life. 
So, wlYy does this school have the 
reputation of being a "think·tank" and 
not a bitchen partY· school that is so very 
popular today. I can't promise you that if 

: I'm elected I can give you a 2O·kegger 
every Friday, but, I will try to relax the 
tension that exists between you . If ~ou 
have a fun and outgoing person as your 

~ leader, which I will be, then life here 
will become more pleasant and the 
students will not be as cold and 
competition·headed . 

If you'd like to meet one of your 
"seldom seen" candidates,l will be on the 

' grass in front of Hl from 12:00·2:00 
today. Thank you.

ARTURO HERRERA 

Having been a college representative 
to the AS has given me the opportunity 
to work with the council and to realize 
that student government at UCSD has 
quite a way to go before it can claim to 
represent the student body. My 
candidacy for AS Vice President is for 
that purpose: to bring student 
government back to where it belongs -
the students. 

There has been lacking in the AS the 
ability to effectively work with and 
communicate with the various student 
organizations, which represent a , 
broader spectrum of students than the 
AS can ever hope to reach. The 
procedures to which organizations are 
subjec ted would enlighten anyone of us 
to the problems of the AS in 
communicating with the hundred or so 
student organizations. It has been my 
experience, talking to various student 
organizations, that the activity fee paid 
by all of us could be used for the 
betterment of the student population 
more effectively through these 
organizations. 

The issued facing students in this 
election are many. The AS's inability to 
gain students' support has consistently 
and unnecessarily prolonged these 
issues, referring to the vending machine 
boycott and the takeover of the Coffee 
Hut by the administration. 

Should student government be 
returned to the students? I say it 
.lIould! Students working for students, 
that's what it's all about. On April 25th 
and 26th keep student government in the 
hands of students. Elect Arturo Herrera 
Vice President. 

NANCY LAGA 

I'm Nancy laga, a Revelle special 
major in "Health Systems and 
Alternative Methods," and an AS Revelle 
Rep and liaison to the Revelle Council 
this year. I actively represent student 
interests, rather than simply lip·serve, 
e .g., Health Science# Coalition rep, 
Associate Director of the Student Health 
Info Program (SHIP), Revelle Hall 
Programs Advisory, Managing Editor of 
Bal •• ee, Committee for Decent 
Daycare, recent bus· cuts, student and 
anti · discrimination in housing, UC 
Nuclear Disarmament, Assoc . of 
Medical Arts and Sciences (AMAS), and 
was even '77 Watermelon Queen. 
Throughout the ve nding issue I have 
informed and organized the collges and 
gradua tes to so far succesfully retain 
their funds . 

The VP must chair the Council, 
manage its business and actions, be its 
resource, promote student involvement, 
and generally keep it flowing. My working 
knowledge of the AS and colleges, i.e " 
AS Rules Committee rep to interpret 
Consitutionality, qualifies me for VP. I've 
reached students through staffing info 
tables, rallys, addressing organizations, 
a~ shall integrate "grassroots with 
bureaucracy" to accomplish and follow· 
through Council and student issues. 

My concerns include: student 
community internships; administrative 
evaluation for better student- fee 
utilization ; departmental organiations; 
positive social responsibility through the 
support of existing orgs like CaJPIRG , 
Greenpeace , Education Opportunity 
Program, SAAC, etc.; and promote and 

Y. ROBYN WASHER 

I honestly believe that I am silly enough 
to preside over the AS Council. The 
thought of being in the middle of endless 
bickering , petty squables , power 
struggles, etc., etc., between innane 
people fighting over silly issues, excites 
me greatly. . 

I am proud of being part of the S~ly 
, Slate. We feel you (students) deserve 

much more from the AS than an 
occa.ioaal beer . We will fight for a 
geriatrics center to rejuvinate tired, 
listless professors into young, dynamic 
lecturers. We will resist all efforts to 
transform the Coffee Hut into an Opium 
Den. Other goals include; converting the 
Revelle fountain into a redwood hot tub 
and the installation of drive·t hru windows 
a t the bookstore . If elected we plan to be 
active in every sphere of student life . 

expand student coopertive servic es , i.e., 
Food, Print, and Bike Co·ops, the Pub, 
Housing Co·ops, and more. Talk is 
cheap unless actuated in the positive 
interest, so I shall promote these feasible 
projects through my expertise and 
experience in coordinating issues. 

The AS must progress as a resource of 
and for students. The VP is an integral 
role to accomplish this, and I am the one 
most qualified to do it. As a "do-er", I will 
again promote and actuate, inform and 
invo lve, and actively Question Authority 
while seeking positive changes in the 
student interest. Support the one who 
has and will support you : Nancy laga, 
VP. 

Candidates Running Unopposed 
BRAD BARHAM 

COMMISSIONER OF APPOINTMENTS AND EVALUATIONS 

Running Unopposed, as I am, allows me the opportunity to shelve the usual 
campaign rhetoric, and instead explain my commitment, my experience, and my goal 
as next year's Commissioner of Appointment and Evaluations. 

My commitment is quite simple. In the two years since the inception of the AS, 
student involvement has not. been very productive. As a result, our intluence on the 
policies and decision making processes of this University has been pretty smaD. 
l1wough my role as an AS recruiter and organizer, I hope to increase student impact 
on the policies of this University by effectively channeling active students illto the AS. 

Having experienced the frustration of being an isolated student on a campuswide 
committee, of serving on an inefficient AS Commissioner, and of being an elected 
representative to the Revelle governin~ board (RCCA) without much people power to 
tackle major issues, I know the organizational problems that plague our student 
government. More importantly though, I also have strong ideas about how to begin 
solving them. • 

My goals are to improve the organization and accountability of the AS, making 
student involvement a visibly produc tive activi ty. Student appointees to over 60 
campuswide committees will be htld responsible thr,ough regular meetings with my 

(PINIS.· IUl'n ttl Bullt .. ln ~,) 

As Commissioner of Public Relations I, Jamie Montgomery, will perform a dual role. 
First, I will inform the ASUCSD of aD information that effects them Second, I will 
discern student sentiment on policy decisions and issues in order that the AS 
government can effectively lobby for the true interests 01 the ASUCSD. 

The principal vehicle for providing the ASUCSD with information concerning 
decisions made by the AS council, the administration, or the Regents of UC is the . 
ASUCSD Bulletin. 1 believe my training and experience in journa6sm win enable me to 
oversee the further development of the ASUCSD Bulletin into a viable tool for 
communications between the AS government and the ASUCSD. -

I will utilize the ASUCSD Bulletin and effective advertising to increase student 
awareness and interest in university sponsored programming, student organizations, 
and special services that itTe available to students. Through a subsequent increase in 
student participation, t~ ASUCSD will move towards a fuller employment of student 
resources and talent . With greater student participation and input into the AS 
government, the AS council will better represent the ASUCSD. 

As COrYlJTlissioner of Public Reldllons I will deal with the individual colleges, the 
Administra tion; and the community.

AS Candidates 
Programming 

TERRELL CHAFIN 

Entertainment programming at UCSD 
is too often aimed at a narow segment of 
the student body. Many of us don't 
benefit from the more than $10,000 spent 
by the ASUCSD this year. ASUCSD 
programming is inefficient, it doesn 't 
meet the needs of the student body. We 
need programming for all students, not 
just enterta inment for a few. If elected. I 
will work for humanized and diversified 
programming . 

Currently, for e xample, Beer Bashes 
a re held in the cramped quarters of 
Building C.lt's more like a cattle pen than 
a party. I feel these parties should be held 
outside , or when they must be held 
indoors, they should be held within 
larger , more spacious facilities (e .g. the 
gyms). I also favor more lunchtime 
concerts by the "hump," featuring a wide 
variety of musical styles (e.g. Reggae, 
New Wave, Accoustic·Folk, Rock 'n 
Roll, and Jazz) as well as an ASUCSD 
Film Series , etc .. . 

In order to accomplish the 
aforementioned , I propose the 
establishment of a UCSD Programming 
Policy Board with membership including 
the Chairs of the College program 
boards, the ASUCSD Programming 
Commission , representatives from 
s tudent organiza tions and staff from the 
University Events Office. The increased 
communication that such a board implies 
can not help by facilitate improvement of 
UCSD entertainment programming at a ll 
levels. 

UCSD can have better programming. 
If elected , I will establish the UCSD 
Programming Policy Board, and work to 
implement and expand upon the quality 
and diversity of UCSD entertainment 
programming for the benefit of all 
students. So, pleas.e vote Terrell Chafin 
for ASUCSD CommIssioner of 
Programming.

MARCOS ORTEGA III 

The nature of UCSD's emphasis on 
academics and little consideration to 
extracurricular activities creates alac k of 
community and identity . Effective 
programming can mediate this problem. 
This can only be done by meeting the 
needs and wants of the students. Student 
a uthority, in deciding the direction, 
policy and procedure in programming 
with the administrative staff providing 
t he te c hni c al and profe ssional 
knowledge, is the ideal struc ture. This 
allows for program selection that will 
most often coinc ide with student 
interests. It provides continuity and 
expertise as well as innovation, and it 
allows the skills of the staff members to 
be widely utilized. 

The administrat ion is c urre n t l~ 
controlling 75% of all programming 
money. Administrative deplet ion of 
programming income, ranging from 
redistribution of vending mac hine money 
to unnecessary, high·paid administra· 
tors is a problems which can be remedied 
through sound restructuring and strong 
student support. 

I am strongly in favor of the 
establishment of an amphitheatre. This 
will relieve the lack of facilities needed for 
large social , political and cultural events. 
A short· term solution to this problem 
would be the request by UE and 
ASUCSD for equal control of present 
campus facilities . With the opening of the 
pub this fall , funding should also be 
sought for continuous entertaining 
events and acts. 

For the past two years I've initiated 
and coordinated numerous events. My 
experienc e with programming is 
extensive. As a Revelle Resident Advisor 
I've been in tune to student needs. I also 
have been a member of the Student 
Organization for Alternative Produc tion . 
With my experience and knowledge in 
programming, I feel I have a lot to offer to 
the student governme nt and to the 
position of Commi s sioner of 
Programming . . 

Activity Fee Chair 

EDWIN CABRERA 

The time has arrived to elect officers 
for student government and once agains 
we have heard candidates boast of the 
vast experience which they possess 
enabling them to run the ASUCSD in its 
most efficient manner. I, like most 
students, an highly critical of such 
campaigning and one question always 
come to mind. If these people have been 
in positions to make changes in the 
way s tudent government is run at this 
school, then why are things still as 
messed·up as they have always been? As 
a candidate for Activity Fee Chair, I feel 
that my best experience is being a 
student and not knowing what my money 
is being used for . 

It is evident that the whole money 
allocation process is in turmoil causing 
many student organizations to receive 
no funding even after repeated valid 
requests. Many organizations, a few of 
which I have been involved with, have 
been affected by the inadequacy of the 
processes and decisions of this year's. 
board . A board in which my opposing 
candidate is a member. Two years ago, 
student organizations received 36% of 
campus activity fee revenues, now they 
receive 22%. This has meant less 
programming due to the fact that groups 
have received pitiful sums of money with 
which to operate. Media has also had to 
contend with insufficient funding which 
has not kept pace with inflation. 

A time for change is called for and that 
is why I am running with the Common 
Sense Slate. Our candidates c~ 
effectively make changes which will 
enable students to know and get involved 
with the student government at UCSD. _ 
As activity Fee Board Chair, my major 
concern would be to provide a fair 
allocation of fee money between student 
government, media , and student 
organizations. 

Vote for the Common Sense Slate. 

BILL TOPKIS 

This year we.need to elect a strong, 
experienced ASUCSD government for 
the students. If elected Activity Fee 
Board Chair I can help create this 
effective student government. 

My qualifications to serve the students 
as Activity Fee Board Chair are based 
upon experience. During the past year I 
have been an AS Representative for Muir 
College. Serving in this capacity I have 
worked as a liaison between the Muir 
College Council and the AS Council. . 

I want an active concerned AS 
Government: One that will protect the 
students' interests with the Coffee Hut. 
An AS that will not let the Chancellor 
steal our vending machine monies. An 
AS that can deliver to the students what 
the students want and deserve. 

I have been a member of the Activity 
Fee Board during this past year. I know 
how the Board is run and what the 
Board's mistakes have been. Through 
over fifty hearings with student 
organizations I have learned what the 
students want from the Activity Fee 
Board and how the Activity Fee budget 
sys tem can work for the students. 

Don 't settle for less with your Activity 
Fees. Vote Bill Topkis for Activity Fee 
Board Chair April 25 and 26 and get what 
you deserve for your money.

AS Candidates 
Academic Affairs Student Welfare 

OLMER KOLPIN 

So you think you're just a lowly 
student here and you're still grateful to 
the wonderful folks down at admissions 
for letting you in? Take a closer look. Did 
you know that: 

-some faculty are given tenure because 
of their spouses' status while faculty 
that students support are being 
consistently tossed out on their ear? 
-CAPE, a student run, student 
supported evaluation service is only 
taken seriously by the faculty when it 
serves their own interests? 
-some departments face losing 
their money because they have reo 
peatedly not taken advantage of their 
resources? 
-the only input students have in the 
tenure process are letters of support 
but the faculty never tell you who is up 
for tenure or when? 
-faculty and administration are making 
decisions that affect you without your 
consultation, i.e. Coffee Hut/ Faculty 
Club scandal, semester vs. quarter 
debate, add/drop, curriculum changes 
and academic budget cuts? 
Do you think this is fair? Are you tired 

of the "divide and conquer" mentality 
that exists at this university? Your 
Academic Affairs Commissioner must be 
someone who knows how to change it. 
For the past year, I have been serving as 
co·chair of the Statewide Committee on 
Academic Affairs, student rep. to the 
Academic Senates' Executive and Policy 
Committee and the ASUCSD's Budget 
Analysis Group. I have been committed 
to student participation and have always 
been dedicated to insuring that student 
opinions be heard and acted upon. What 
is needed at this campus is more respect 
for student opinion, and I think that I can 
bring that respect to UCSD.

CONRADO GERARDO 

In the time that rve attended this 
university, I've participated in AS board 
meetings both as participant and non· 
participant (occasionally) and have 
noticed a lack of reasonable 
representation of Third World students, 
which seems to be a syndrome of this 
university. 

My purposes for placing my name as 
one of the candidates for Academic 
Affairs are; (A) To insure representation 
for students of color within the 
Associated Student Board, while not 
making it my sole purpose and (B) 
formulate some form of comm· 
unications/ support between student 
organizations and the AS which in my 
view has been a problematic area. 

In reference to my qualifications : I 
have been involved in Junior Community 
College Student Government in two 
colleges, Mesa Community College and 
Maricopa Technical, both of which are in 
Arizona. There I basically was involved 
with Academic issues that affect 
students (i .e . teacher/student conflicts, 
curriculum recommendations, working 
with Administrative Staff, etc.). Here at 
UCSD my involvement has been also in 
the same lines for the past year and a half. 
I've looked into s uc h areas as 
recruitment, retention, tenure, 
supportive programs and how they 
reflect the needs of students, but with 
more emphasis on the Chicano/ Chicana 
population. 

In closing let me mention that 
MECHA, BSU, NASA , AASA, MUJER, 
and Voz Fro.teriza have all endorsed 
me in my efforts to get elected to the 
position of Academic Affairs . Please vote 
for Conrado Gerardo on April 25 and 26.

LINDA SABO 
Linda Sabo is a Warren College junior, 

majoring in philosophy and minoring in 
biology. She is willing to be a part of " the 
political process" for the same reasons 
that she is pursuing a doctorate - "too 
many of those who now make decisions 
that affect many people, 'have their 
minds on another planet', (i .e. : they 
should be replaced)." 

With this motivation she has been 
involved in such activities as: last ~nd this 
year's state legislative budget hearings, 
78· 79 lobbyist for the California 
Children's Lobby, intern last year for the 
Lt . Governor, intern this year for the 
State Assembly; (on a project to 
investigate the roots of violence in 
society), presently the student 
representative on the Committee on 
Educational Policy of UCSD's Academic 
Senate, and is the current University of 
California Student Lobby Annex 
director. Linda has already been doing 
much of the work of external affairs 
office . She is and will be, work ing on such 
projects as: a UCSD internship office, 
many more cC)·op run student 
enterprises (record, book. expanded 
food co-ops). UC and other University 
exchange programs, student housing 
legislation. co·operative housing on 
campus, and Regental funding for child 
care . Linda Sabo is the most qualified 
candidate , because; she wants to make 
this a better place for students, she has 
the abili ty to "Question Authori ty" and 
the experience to know ways to do it 
effectively.

Coordinating and building up campus 

media to their fulle~t potential should be 
the objective of the Commissioner of 
Communications. The fact that a serious 
commitment has not been made in the 
past is obvious. Campus media are 
underfunded, understaffed, and poorly 
organized. The result is that the media 
are not what they could be . 

Funding of media could be increased 
through organzation of an advertising 
pool, in which media could cooper~te to 
bring in ads they can't get individually. 
The Media Board shoudl func a work· 
study student with experience in 
marketin,g to recruit potential 
advertisers . My experience in 
formulating KSDT's advertising policy 
will be useful in coordinating an ad pool. 

To get students involved in media, 
open ings must be publicized , and 
students in time· consuming media 
positions should receive units for the 
practical media·related experience they 
get by volunteering time and energy. My 
work on these ideas at KSDT (through 
Drama and Communications) has 
resulted in this quarter 's "Radio and 
Theatre Company" and "Radio and 
Society" classes. 

Finally, the Media Board must be 
composed of media· knowledgeable 
people, rather than political college 
representatives . My media experience 
will fost~r appointment of a 
knowledgeable, effective, and organized 
Media Board.

There has been a' definite lack of

will not sign any mutual defense treaties 
with major international powers. I will 
stick with this position even though I 
have been pressured to change it. Also, I

I will continue the cooperation 

between the AS counc il and the 
individual college councils to insure the 
success of joint loby efforts on behalf of 
student interests. 

In dealing wit h the administration, I will 
inform the ASUCSD of the 
administration's decisions or impending 
decisions. In turn, I will inform the 
administration of student sentiment on 
such issues . Through deve loping 
communiciltions channels between the 
administration and the ASUCSD 
students will more effectively be able to 
lobby for their interests. These interests 
include the current vending machine 
controversy, student input into tenure, 

MARK SATTERLEE 
The ASUCSD, in the two years of its 

existence has been ineffectual in dealing 
with student problems. I believe, 
contrary to the IlJidely circulated notion 
that holds the ASUCSD as inherently 
impotent, there is real potential for the 
AS to work for the entire under!7aduate 
student body. This potential can never 
be realized, however , if the ASUCSD 
continues to exclude the vast majority of 
UCSD's students from participation. 

In order for the ASUCSD to effectively 
and efficiently deal with student needs, 
some structural revision must take place. 
If students support Common Sense in 
the upcoming election, we will make 
these changes. Specifically, we propose 
structurally guaranteeing sutdent 
organizations and media a greater 
proportion of the Campus Activity Fee 
than they now receive at the expense of 
the 'AS "operating fund" which we 
consider excessive . 

Specifically, the Commissioner of 
Communications oversees the various 
campus media and KSDT. Currently, 
several campus papers are in danger of 
disappearing for lack of funds. KSDT's 
position has improved over the last two 
years, but even there such success will 
continue only if additional funds are 
made available. The Common Sense 
slate will make tfiese funds available. 

If you favor the continued anemia of 
alternative media on campus, vote 
accordingly. If however, you want your 
money to pay for improved campus 
media resources , vote Common 
Sense. It 's your money . it's your 
choice! V ote Mark Saterlee

Third-
SERGIO SANTOS, ALEXIS HERNAN-
DEZ; MARK ESCAJEDA 

On April 25 and 26, Third College 
students have the opportunity to change 
the structure of the relationship betwen 
the ASUCSD and Third College. On 
thole two days, Third students can elect 
Sergio Santos, Alexis Hernandez ana 
Mark Escajeda, united in favor of A 
Stronger Voice For Third, to the three 
Third College AS Representative 
pOsitions. 

As Third Representatives to the AS 
Council, we intend to give Third students 
a stronger voice by solidifying 
communication and organization within 
the College itself_ We believe the power 
behind the ASUCSD comes from, not 
the Council, but the students the Council 
represents. 

We want to use this power by 
eltablishing methods by which Third 
ltudents can express their opinions to 
the AS through us, the Third College 
Representatives. With weekly meetings 
at convenient locations at Third where 
students can express their ideas and 
thoughts, as well as frequent 
opportunities for off-campus students to 
tiNe their views, we intend to bring the 
AS to its power source - you. We want 
to solicit your input, your needs and your 
complaints. The ASUCSD can only 
work for you when you get involved. We 
want to enhance your chances of getting 
involved. 

We will be visable representatives. We 
want you to recognize us and give us 
your thoughts and opinions. We want to 
take the time to make the AS work for 
you. All we need is your support. On 
April 25 and 26, elect Sergio Santos, 
Alexis Hernandez and Mark Escajeda 
Third College AS Representatives. 

It is my belief that we need be 
concerned with the concept of 
education. I do not solely speak of 
professor tenures hip and teaching, or 
needed facilities to accommodate 
students (both educational and social), 
but I also draw attention to minority 
recruitment, and if we as students are 
commited towards the idea of 
"education" then the above statements, 
in one nutshell, are educational and 
social concerns, with respect to the 
quality and quantity of education as it 
pertains to education. We then, as 
concerned students, should be about the 
idea of maintaining quality education. 

Our past ASUCSD has not performed 
adequately in this area: maintaining 
quality education. Rather, they have 
seen fit to misallocate your money and 
time on issues such as the Vending 
Machine and Coffee Hut. They have 
decided that quality education, as it 
reflects to those professors receiving 
tenure, and their ability to effectively 
instruct, the declining minority 
enrollment and poor social atmosphere 
of UCSD, as being secondary to where 
they ",.nt the issues to be focused . 
They neglect to place education above 
these secondary money sources, they 
neglect to attack the issues of how they 
relate towards education. They have 
gone off on a tangent. 

People of "Third," with your help I can 
place education ,back into the spotlight. I 
will be able to place student concerns 
and voice above those of power-crazed 
officers. I will help you, but you must vote 
for me for this to occur. 

AS 'Representatives 
. 

TOM CANARIS 

The primary function of the 
Associated Student representative is 
clearly to carry out the needs and wants 
of the student. During the year this is 
done through talking to both students 
and the associated student body leaders, 
and by working together as a liaison of 
the two. Having been a member of the 
Revelle Organization Committee (ROC) 
and member of the Revelle Program 
Board (RPB), I've found, in my 
experience, problems in communi-
cation between Reve"e College student 
leaders who are responsible for 
facilitating student involvement in 
college, as well as campus wide activities 
and issues. AS Council decisions are 
made news through heresay, and/or by 
reading The G ..... dy • . An established 
"post" is needed that would serve to 
relay the ASSC's issues back to student 
leaders and other students at the college 
level. Such an action would prevent such 
"counter strategies" as two day delays in 
boycott participations. This "post" 
would require that student feedback on 
AS issues be monitored through 
questionnaires and informal meetings 
(e.g. during suite meetings). The post 
would consist of the three College 
representatives working as a team to 
unify student opinion and at the same 
time exhibit a cohesive support on 
campus-wide issues, in order to promote 
representation at the campu~-wide level. 
rt I am elected, one of my primary goals 
will help establish this much needed 
"post" so that the duties of AS 
representative are fulfilled. 

Revelle 
WILLIAM CLUFF 

If elected, I intend to serve in the best 
interest of Revelle students. I am a third 
year Reve"e senior majoring in 
Management Science and minoring in 
Math. As such, I feel I understand many 
of the desires and aspirations of Reve"e 
students. 

One of. my concerns is the distribution 
of AS funds. In the past, various special 
interest groups have received a much 
larger percent of the budget than the 
number of students they represent. This 
practice must end. I will work hard to 
ensure that funds allocated by the AS go 
where students want them to go and not 
where minority interests want them to 
go. 

Furthermore, I shall handle my 
responsibilities with adroitness and a 
finesse that has been sadly lacking in the 
AS. My motto is, "Dignity, ' ruways 
dignity," and while retaining this spirit I 
will vigorously represent the interests of 
Revelle students. I ask your support in 
the upcoming election and that you vote 
this Wednesday and Thursday, 
regardless of whether or not you choose 
me, in order that your prerogatives be 
yOlCed . Thank you. 

Warren 
JUDY GOLDMAN 

It really bothers me when I hear the AS 
referred to as a "joke" or a "circus" - if 
only more students were aware of the 
amount of thought and deliberation that 
goes into the Council's decisions! 
Commissioners and reps give up hours 
of their personal time each week to try 
and help other students. True, for some 
it may be a power trip - that's why apat hy 
in the Council gTOWS and the year 
progresses. What a disservice they do to 
the students who elect them ... if an office 
were entrusted to me, I can confidently 
say I have. the energy and creativity to 
make it mO\le. Then again, if I am not 
elected I'll have more study time. A 
college rep is in no position to make 
"campaign promises" . at least not 
promises that are worth much, becuase 
the AS progresses as a unit. I've spent 
some time working with the AS this year, 
and would like the opportunity to 
continue to do so. Look, I know I'm 
comp2tent.. . all you can do is take your 
chances and vote .

JAN BRESLAUER 

Warren College's representation in 
the ASUCSD this year has been an . 
effective and commendable one. With 
the bringing in of a riew AS, it b+>comes 
crucial that Warren continues to be a 
leader in student government. Problems 
that have faced both Warren and UCSD, 
such as the vending machine issue, need 
to be dealt with in an ongoing manner . 
The work the AS has done this year must 
be a basis from which next year's AS will 
start. Continuity in government will bring 
us more credibility in front of the 
admiflist ra tion. 

Serving in Warren College Student 
Government (WCSG) and working with 
the AS has given me a unique 
opportunity to observe how we have 
been succesful and where we need to 
improve. The changes being made in 
WCSG for the next year wi" prepare us 
to work better as a unit and to work with 
the AS. I have no intention of decreasing 
my involvement with WCSG. I want to 
keep the connection strong by being d 
part of both governments and incresillg 
Ihe flow of infonnatiotl between the two.

VIC HOUSER 

My name is Vic Houser and I want to 
represent Revelle College in the 
ASUCSD. My goal as representative is 
to make university issues clear to 
students, and to assure them that the 
authentic concerns of the student body 
are being communicated and acted 
upon . 

I will focus my energy on issues that 
are pertinent to improving the 
educational environment at UCSD. 
Tenure, for example, should not be 
awarded or denied without student 
representation. I wi" work for that 
representation. 

Control-of student money is a vital 
issue. Student resources (i.e. vending 
machines and the Coffee Hut) should be 
protected from the arbitrary 
appropriation of the administration. 
Also, the interests of minorities must be 
solicited to assure fair distribution of 
Activity Fees. 

Students do have a voice . The 
ASUCSD is a powerful resource that is 
greatly underestimated and misunder-
stood as aremote, ineffective institution. 
It doesn 't have to be that way, and it is 
your responsibility to select a 
spokesperson who is both sensitive to 
your interests and forceful to get results. 
I know the dimensions of the office, I 
know it is right for me. Give me the 
opportunity to prove that your opinion 
does count. Vote for Vic Houser, AS 
Representative, Reve"e College .

It's Not Just Another Election 

If You Get Involved 
It 'Can Make A Difference 

By Brad Barham 
Just reading another "Get 

[nvolved" article, as you 
prepare to vote in just another 
AS election, for what will be 
just a nother school year, 1979-
80. Is that your attitude? 

Probably nOL .Everyone has 
their own plans and high hopes 
for next year, a positive 
attitude over all . But, just try 
asking students to Get In vol

'
!ed 

and hclp improve the quality of 
life at UCSD, you might be 
surpri ed how quickly their 
high hopes ' and positive 
a ttitudes become cynical 
observations and negative 
attitudes. 

To be sure , negative attitudes 
towards student government 
are understandable, but they go 
nowhere . accomplish nothing 
except to allow administrators 
[0 make unchallenged, 
unquestioned decisions . which 
di rectly affect our college 
experience. The AS, however, 
orrers students the opportunity 
to work together to influence 
the decision making process of 
this university. 

With student involvement. 
the AS can exert a powerful 

influence on this school. 
Students working within a 
better organized and strongly 
supported AS could affect 
changes in Academic Policies, 
Bookstore Operations , Uni-
versity Programming, Library 
hours and Housing problems to 
name a few areas. 

Eleven AS officers and 
twelve college reps can simply 
not effectively voice student 
opinions . Your support is 
needed. 

Besides improving our 
community, getting involved 
offers many personal rewards. 
If you choose to participate on a 
campus wide committee, then 
you will be meeting with faculty 
and admi nistrators on a 
regular basis . They may 
become excellent sourCes for 
recommendations, if you can 
earn their respect as an 
effective- student repre-
sentative . In addition, on your 
resume involvement will show 
your concern and contributions 
to your community. 

More importantly , being 
involved will cnable you to 
en hance your education. 
College is more than just one 

lecture after another , more ' 
than midterms, papers, books 
and finals . College is 
experienCing the ideas, people, 
and ' society around you. 
Moreover, college is a safe 
testing ground for ideas , 
decision making, abilities , and 
skills in meetings and dealing 
with a whole variety of people. 

The application below 1 your 
ticket for involvement. There 
are over sixty campuswide 
committees under the jurisdic-
tion of the AS with openings for 
you . Also, each of the elected 
commissioners will have a 
commission of students 
working on issues and actions. 
On the following pages of the 
ASUCSD BULLETIN, the 
committees and commissions 
are briefly described. They all 
deal with University life and 
need your abi lities , en -
thusiasm, and the commitment 
of only a few hours per week. 

We, the students of UCSD , 
can improve the quality of life 
on campus and our own lives, 
simply by getting involved in 
what could be more than just 
another year.

AS Seeking 
Active Students 
For Co.mmittees 

The actual process of 
applying for a committee or 
commission position is simple. 
Filling out the applications 
below is the first step. After 
filling out the application , drop 
it by the AS office and pick up 
an informa tion sheet, con-
ta ining dates a nd times of the 
interviews. 

The process is then extended 
to one or two interviews, 
depending on the committee to 
which you are applying and the 
extensiveness of your first 
interview. The decisions of the 
Appointments and Evaluations 
Commission will be posted in 
the AS offices and each 
applicant will receive a letter 
by mail detailing information 
concerning their respective 
appointment. 

Interviews will be in groups 
with approximately three 
interviewers and five to six 
interviewees. This is necessary 
due to the volume of 
applications received. How-
ever, there are many, many 
positions open and a variety of 
ways to serve in the AS. The 
purpose of the interviews is not 
to grill the applicants but to find 
out thei r intere ts and place 
them in an appropriate 
position. 

Each committee is composed 
of faculty , administrators. 
stafr. and students. In the 
majority of the committees, 
there is only one student on the 
committee. The amount of time 
necessary is dependent on each 
committee: some · will meet 
weekly while others may only 
have an annual meeting. 

The commissions and boards 
usually are composed of 5-10 
members who work directly 
with a commi sioner. They 
deal with issues that the AS is 
directly involved with. The 
commission and board 
members will be a vital part of 
the effective running of the AS 
offices. Everyone wastes a 
couple of hours each week 
doing absolutely nothing. 
Serving on a committee often 
requires little of your time with 
no experience necessary. 

is no reason why everyone 
shouldn't apply for something. 
All you have to lose is a few 
minutes, while you stand the 
chance of gaining much, much 
more. 

Elections Board 
This boa rct works with the 

Commissioner of Elections to 
promote and effectively run 
any elections sponsored by the 
ASUCSD. The board consists of 
seven members, each of whom 
work on di[ferent aspects of the 
elections process. 
Student Welfare Commission 

This cOl1"lmission will work 
with the Student Welfare 
Commissioner in establishing 
programs to aid students. One 
of the most important 
programs is the Student 
Advocates who work on behalf 
of individual students with 
problems in administration, 
academics and legal affairs. 
Public Relations Commission 

With the assistance of the 
Commissioner of Public 
Relations, this commission will 
promote the activities of the 
AS, working very closely with 
the members of the AS Council. 
In addition, they will be 
promoting an outreach 
program . People on this 
commission will work with 

I(SDT. the Guardian , publicity 
for all AS functions . 

Programming Board 
The lloard will assist the 

programming Commissioner 
in planning and promoting 
programming events. People 
on the commission will work on 
Publicity , working with 
colleges , University Events 
and the TGIF's.

Graham Parker and the 
Rumour coming in the opposite

diminutive English pub-
rocker was the runt whom a 
gang of red-necked motorcycle 
toughs had dutifully protected, 
out of, if for no other reason. an 
unusual respect for the little 
auy. But Graham Parker 
doesn't drive motorcycles and 
he doesn·t carry anything even 
remotely resembling a chain. 

Graham Parker is a singer 
and it is when he hits the stage 
that the true nature of the 
band's celebrated relationship 
comes . to light. Flanked by 
Brlnsley Schwa!"z. Martin 
Belmont and Andrew Bondar 
(aU of whom are hefty six-
footen whose looks conjure up 
memories of All-American

gave the audience a twenty-one 
song lesson on the way rock and 
roll should be played, MaRing 
light of his previous frust-
rations in a song appropriately 
titled "Mercury Poisoning," he 
describes himself as " the best

non-Si lly tudents in government. I would be bringing 
in ma ny people presently not involved wi th 
gove l'l1menL. Mos t tudents at UCS D aren' t in volved 
in government. and if I get elected, I wi ll be tryi ng to 
get as ma ny people in gove rnment as possi ble , 
including Silly Students . 
Guardian: What do you have to bring to the election 
that Ca rlos and Bar ry don' t? 
JC: I think I'm the only one addressing the issue so 
far . [ don' t th ink Ca rlos a nd Barry ha ve even 
addressed the Silly Sla te ye t. 
Guardian: When do you sta rt campaigning ? 
JC: The bulk of our campa ign will be (this) week. 
On Monday, I plan to be on Reve lle Plaza , greeting 
students, That's all contingent upon my lining up two 
more bodyguards for m yself. I don 't think that wHi be 
lI ny problem. We had to cancel our NBC commerica l 
spots s ince adve rtiSing off campus isn 't allowed . 
We ' ll be putting out handouts and posters, and trying 
to talk to as many students as we ca n, t rying to 
expl ain what "silly" is and why they should vote silly . 
Guardian : Do you think the Silly Students have' any 
chance of winnin g? 
JC: Certa inly, but our biggest problem is our 
di ffi culty in vot ing . Most of us don 't rea lize when the 
e lection is , a nd if we do, we have difficulty finding 
where to vote. (Silly Students) often end up in the 
wrong line, a nd end up getting cafete ria food, or up at 
the cashier 's offi ce, wa it ing in line. Even if they do 
manage to get into the voting booth , they often get 
conCu ed. They get in there a nd they forget why 
they're th ere , so that's th e diff icully. We .have to 
educa te sill y stude nts on how to res pond in an 
e lecti on. The AS hasn ' t told them how to do this , so it ' s 
the select few th at are voting , 
Guardian: Why were the Silly Students orga nized? 
JC: To promote silliness throughout UCSD and the 
world. Silliness is a ve ry important part oC student 
life. People who are involved in the Sil ly Students like 
to have fun . We were formed fall qua rter, so whatI ' ve 
been doing is building support , and getting our 
organiza tion built up . Next yea r , we pl an to be ve ry 
active. We have about 30 members in our orga niza tion 
who are a cti ve now. 
Guardian: How do you pla n to handle statewide 
concerns , like UC divestment of holdings in those 
businesses that do business with South Africa ? 
JC: I think I'd get along well with the Regents, 
because they 'd appreciate my silliness. 
Guardian: Anything you want to add? 
JC: I think the students desel've more from the AS 
than ,111 o<::casiona l beer.

ma king roles . So will the commissioners. rath er than 
the pres idcnt. If th ey have an idell, I'll allocate any 
re ource to them to carry it out. 
Gua rdia n: Monta lvo says the Co mmon Sen 'e slate j ' 
too ideologicaJl y oriented. Do you th ink that's true? 
BH: It·s a very fu nny th ing. I attended the naming of 
Third Cullege conference, a nd one of the names of the 
collegc th at wa brought up wa " Lu mumba-
Zapata." Sung Choe (Third Co llege rcp resentat ive to 
the AS Co uncil) sa id it was too ideological. I poi nted 
out tha t Lumumba-Zapata is ideological if you just 
look a t the name, but if you look at what Lumumba-
Zapa ta represents , it represents edu cat iona l goals, 
educationa l attai nment for minorities . In this 
particular case . the Common Sense s late, I think it' s 
our actions, where we want to spread , more or less, a 
working condit ion where students have control over 
their own li ves. To me, it' s a blend of goa ls in 
education and goals in people's li ves blending in with 
ideology . Ideology, as such, may be the motiva ting 
tool , but it is by no means the e nd in itself. 
Guardian: Why do so many s tudents leave here? 
BH: A lot of courses they need for their educationa l 
goa ls a re not offered here. They also feel unhappy 
because of ttl e socia l environment. There a ren't a lot 
of things gOing on on ca mpus. Many people go to 
Berkeley and Los Angeles. But there aren' t a lot of 
people going from SD to Riverside orSD to Irvine , so I 
think the main reason is educationa l goals. But! think 
there is a deeper a lienation at this school tha t goes on 
a t mo st unive rsities . 
Guardian: W)lat can the AS do to keep students here ? 
BH: We can dea l wi th it on two levels, a n educationa l 
level and a cultura l le vel. On the educationa l leve l we 
have to advocate for students . We have to advocate 
fo r students wh en they get their grades, we have to 
see that the curves in the gene ra l educa tion classes 
ure muc h more in tune with the students. It depends 
on wha t student want on the chool. Thel'e should be 
u lot mo re dances , and togethe r type of things, things 
that people wi ll enjoy, not the concerts th at co ·t $7 .50 . 
And you don' t charge $2.50 a head to ge t into a dance . 
Ther ' shou ld be la rge, outdoor events . Togethel' with 
the AS a nd the colleges , we can do that. 
Guardia n: ])0 yo u th ink yo u could wurk wi th 
members of th c Ques ti on Authorit y s la te '.'

IICommissioner Candidates 

Mo,ntalvQ 
(Continued from page 16) 
Guardia n: Your campaIgn slogan is " Question 
Authorit y , " es pe c i a ll y t he a uth o rit y o f 
admini s tra tors . How ca n s tud e nts go a bout 
questioning admi nistrators? 
CM: It 's rea lly easy. We've been doing it a ll year long. 
Administ ra tors are as out oC touch with students as 
student are out of touch with students, because 
there's no communication between the various 
communities on this campus. It 's I)ot like McElroy is 
pu rposely trying to bufoo the s tudents when he says, 
" Well , let 's taRe ove r the CoHee Hut. " It 'sjust that he 
comes in he re during lunch, doesn't see students, and 
says, " Well, students must not be using the CoCCee-
Hut, 0 let' s use it Cor a faculty Club." But he doesn' t 
come in here during dinner when they are serving 
liver and onions in the cafeteria, and the place is 
tota lly packed as the only viable outlet for students. 
Questioning authority is nothing more than saying 
" you ' re off base on this one ." Students do use the 
Coffee Hut. and once you bring up a logical objection 
to their authority, then they 're usually more than 
willing to compromise with the students. As Car as WI' 
know , a ll plans to convert the CoCCee Hutinto a faculty 
club have been stopped. 
Guardian: As commissioner of public relations, do 
you think you 've brought the AS more in touch with 
students? 
CM: I've been trying to bringtheASout to the student, 
which is why I've gotten myself involved in TGIF's, 
There are two places where everybody sees the AS; in 
the news papers, where it says everybody's ragging 
on each other in the Council , and the TGIF's. We had 
22 people on the council , oC whom only 8 or 9 were 
doing any form of a job. The handful of people that 
have been holding the mother together have not only 
been trying to do their job but try to pick up the pieces 
for everybody else. As far as public relations, I've 
tried to make the AS more accessible to students, 
through the AS Dulletin Doa rd and Daycare 
Information Board , a nd by putting the bureaucracy of 
the AS down on black and white, through the KSDT 
s peakers , through working with the colleges. The best 
thing the AS can do is be nothing more than a 
resource, whereby the va rious student groups can 
come to the AS for support, backing, assistance, for 
clout. The AS can' t pretend to do everything. 
Guardian: How effective can the AS be in lobbying the 
Regents on issues like divestment? 
CM: Tha t' s one thing that really weirds me out. 
Candidates last year, and some candidates this year, 
have a tendency on running on political buzz words. 
"Democratiza tion of the Regents" is one of them. 
" Tenure ," " Communications as a Departm~nt" are 
nothing more than political buzzwords that have no 
substantial efrect other than creating pseudo-
emotiona lism. You come out and say , " we' re going to 
give tenure to the students, man,'· and people go 
"yeah, yeah, we want tenure." And people want 
communications as a department , so you have the 800 
or so communications students going, " yeah, we' re 
going to vote for this guy." That's bullshit. People 
have been yelling out those same bunwords ever 
since student government's been around.

hitting in, A tired Bob Rhoades 
slammed some balls in the 
form that makes him so 
valuable to Dannevik. 

" If we had had Rhoades all 
season," said the Triton coach, 
"our record in leaeue would 
have been a bout 6-2 instead of 4-
4." 

Though pleased with this 
year's third place in league, 
rookie coach Dannevik leaves 
no doubts that next year he 
expects a higher finish . 
. 'Sometimes I hindered the 
team this season because I 
didn't always know what to do. 
Next year I ' ll have a better 
handle on everything. I'll know 
where to put the work on." 

The entire 1979 team, except 
graduating John Lee, will 
return in September for 
conditioning and weight 
training. Some new players, 
including a 6'5" junior college 
transfer, will be waiting for 
them in the fall like vultures, 
however, trying to steal the old 
players ' slots. 

"The last six or seven on the 
roster may not make the team 
next year," sa id Dannevik. 
''I'm very excited about our 
new recruits ." 

If anything, Dannevik is 
eager to s top the .. revolving 
door" of coaches for the Tritons 
(he is the third in three years) 
and swbilize the team . 

"In the last three or four 
years. the team has finished the 
season with only seven guys. 
This year, only one player quit 
If the guys are still interested, 
and they had fun, then that's 
success.

Guardian: Why are you running? 
JC: I originally thoughtI was running for Chancellor 
- a good salary, .a nice office, a secretary ... then I 
discovered I was running for President. This is after I 
turned in my petition. I realized people were running 
against me. It was quite a shock. But since I'd 
progressed that far into the campaign, I decided to go 
through with it. I think I'd enjoy being president. 
Guardian: Can a Silly Students candidate do the 
serious business the AS has to do? 
JC: The AS does serious business? I'm SIJre we could 
do anything. . 
Guardian: The University of Wisconsi" \'I;!rsion of the 
silly students had a whole list of campaign promises , 
including abuse of student funds and construction of 
idols on campus. Do the Silly Students have a 
platform? 
JC: Certainly. We believe that the bookstore should 
install drive-through windows. That would peed up

Guardian: Why are you running? 
BH: To create a change on campus. What I plan to do 
is make a lot of structural changes so that it is in many 
ways decentralized and gives more power to the 
students instead of a special clique or elite. 
Guardian: What kind of structural changes? 
BH: Dasically, make the meetings more open. Have 
an economic reform where I will give a third of the 
student uctivity fee to student organizations, a third to 
campus media and a third to the government, and the 
government will exercise no control over the activity 
fee to the organizations .or media groups. 
Guardian: Who would then? 
BH: The organizations themselves WOUld, They 
would monitor the money, they would have their own 
reserves, basically, they would do what they will with 
the money . 
Guardian: Do you see any change in the way the AS 
Council formally sLructures itself?

Carlos 
Montalvo 

Guardian: Why are you running? 
CM: The main reason is that my experiences atUCSD 
are such that there is no sense of community on this 
campuS. Essentially, every relationshi~ that is 
established on this campus is a competitive one, 
whether it's competition in academics, competition 
between Muir College and Revelle College, orthetype 
of threatening competition between the faculty and 
students. From Day On~ you're told they are only 
going to be so many A's, so many B's, etc., and right 
there, you're placing students In cOl'npetition . How 
are you going to get in the top ten percent? Kiss ass, I 
see the AS as-a resource whereby people can plug in to 
this cumpus .ind start estublishing communities. I 
don't mean thut the AS should take over. People feel 
threatened by the AS. There's competition between 
the 1'S and the ('olleges, where the Deans are clinging 
on to their territoriality, and feel threatened by the AS 
growing. At the same thne, the AS feels threatened by 
t!:le Deans In that they feel the Deans al'e trying to 
undermine them. The main thing is to try and
