Robert M. Winslow, UCSD pro-
fessor of medicine and founder 
of San Diego biotech company 
Sangart Inc. passed away at his 
home last month from brain cancer. 
He was 67.

An expert in blood-substitutes 
products and high-altitude physiol-
ogy, Winslow led research expedi-
tions to Peru, Chile, Nepal and 
Mount Everest to study life near 
the extremes of the earth’s oxygen 
atmosphere. From 1985 to 1991, he 
served as chief of the U.S. Army’s 
blood research division and acting 
deputy commander at the Letterman 
Army Institute of Research in 
Presidio of San Francisco.

“Robert Winslow was my friend 
and colleague for over 20 years, 
and from the very beginning there 
was a very strong meeting of the 
minds,” said UCSD professor of bio-
engineering and applied mechanics 
Marcos Intaglietta. “Bob was not 
shy about expressing his ideas and 
was very much appreciated for his 

outspoken commentary on impor-
tant matters, but he had a great 
sense of humor and style.”

A native of New Ulm, Minn., 
Winslow graduated from the 
University of Minnesota in 1960 
and earned his M.D. from Johns 
Hopkins University in 1966. He con-
sulted for many government agen-
cies, including the Food and Drug 
Administration, the World Health 
Organization, the Federal Aviation 
Administration and the Pan-
American Health Organization. He 
is the author of over 200 scientific 
papers and several books on oxy-
gen-transport physiology.

Winslow is survived by his wife, 
six children and six grandchildren.

The National Governers 
Association released a statement 
last week endorsing the national-
ization of primary and secondary 
education standards by evaluating 
student performance on interna-
tional tests.

Several education groups 
— including the Council of the 
Great City Schools, the National 
Association of Secondary School 
Principals and the American 
Federation of Teachers — have 
agreed that the federal govern-
ment should devise a definition of 
what American students should be 
required to know in each grade.

Despite these recent endorse-
ments, establishing the standards 
and winning public support for them 
will be difficult, according to one 
long-time advocate of such stan-
dards.

“The United States does not 
have an obvious mechanism for 
doing them,” said Chester E. Finn 
Jr., the president of the Thomas B. 
Fordham Institute, a Washington-
based think tank. “As a result, 
everything is improvisational and 
has drawbacks.”

In addition, some educators are 
concerned that a national school 
policy would undermine teachers’ 
judgment of curriculum and teach-
ing methods.

“What I’m mostly concerned 
about ... is doing on a national level 

what we’re doing too much of on 
the state and local levels,” said 
Deborah Meier, a former New York 
City principal and a senior scholar 
at New York University. “We’re gov-
erning by distance authority.”

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
released a campus alert March 4 
announcing proposed changes 
to the UCSD Smoke-Free Policy. 
Currently, the policy prohibits smok-
ing indoors or within 20 feet of 
facilities. 

In order to comply with the U.S. 
Green Building Council’s Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design 
certification requirements, campus 
officials are considering expand-
ing the smoke-free perimeter from 
20 feet to 25 feet. The proposed 
policy revisions are available online 
at adminrecords.ucsd.edu/ppm/
updates/proposedchanges270-
7.pdf. Public comments may be 
submitted to chancellor@ucsd.edu 
until April 10.

Call it what you will — ironic, irresponsible or just base-lessly authoritarian — the 
bottom line is that committee mem-
bers appointed to redraft UCSD’s 
speech policy are clueless as to why 
our campus even needs the policy 
overhaul, and are ignorant to the 
methodology of the committee itself.

Inspiring confidence in her com-
mitment to free speech and trans-
parency, committee chair Sally 
Brainerd forbade the Guardian 
editorial board from observing the 
committee’s Wednesday meeting — 
despite requests from the three stu-
dent representatives and Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
R. Ratcliff to the contrary. When 
faced with the Brown Act — which 
demands transparency for public 
boards — Brainerd and committee 
member Harvey Goldman insisted 
that the committee was “closed” and 
thus exempt from the law. However, 
according to campus counsel Daniel 
Park, “There is no campus policy 
regarding the attendance of pub-
lic observers at advisory committee 
meetings. Whether public observers 
are permitted or not is up to the dis-
cretion of the committee.”

Brainerd’s choice was clear.
More importantly, committee 

members don’t seem to know why 
they’re revising the policy in the 
first place. As of yet, no one on 
the committee has provided a legiti-
mate reason for the university’s two-
year push to change the on-campus 
speech policy (the most common 
answer being “I don’t know”). 

While it’s true that current guide-
lines, which have been in place for 
nearly 30 years, are muddy and con-
fusing, the answer is not to draft 
another draconian and ultimately 
superfluous document. Rather, 

administrators need to drop the 
paternal pretense and stop try-
ing to craft their own meaning of 
free speech — because, frankly, the 
Constitution has sufficed for cen-
turies.

Administrators are concerned 
that overzealous students will dis-
turb UCSD’s comfortably bland cli-
mate. They’d rather seize our loud-
speakers and camping gear, encour-
aging protest in the form of written 
requests and endless meetings — but 
that shouldn’t fly in a learning envi-
ronment, where ideas are supposed 
to be freely exchanged. 

The policy is arbitrary. The abil-
ity to express our ideas — whether 
through a loudspeaker or in the 
form of a three-day sit-in — should 
be preserved both for the sake of 
protecting our constitutional rights 
and our campus’ intellectual growth. 

The definition of free speech is 
pretty simple. Alterations, be they 
in the form of restricting ampli-

fiers, banning campouts or creating 
decibel limits, undermine the prin-
ciples of free expression on which 
higher education should be founded. 
Over the two years that have been 
spent on policy revision, only one 
point remains clear: The university 
is using this opportunity to pick and 
choose what and whom they’d like 
to regulate.

And evidently, the committee’s 
student representatives are being 
bulldozed by malevolent adminis-
trators like Brainerd. 

Undergraduate representative 
Erin Brodwin and graduate represen-
tative Benjamin Balthaser explained 
the process: Administrators and 
students are coming together with 
two very different ideas of what the 
policy should be, and are forced 
to compromise. But how can the 
resulting policy protect free speech 
when it’s so saturated with polarized 
interests? 

Freedom of speech is our indis-

pensable right, and unfortunately, 
we can’t trust this haphazard com-
mittee to preserve it. Students must 
keep a close watch on the commit-
tee’s actions and attend the public 
meetings until administrators realize 
they don’t supercede the law — or 
the Constitution.

Last Tuesday, Pres. Barack Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to garner 
support for the American Recovery 
and Investment Act and other 
forthcoming policies. The speech was 
filled with your typical presidential 
discourse — describing threats to 
our prosperity, making promises to 
citizens from all walks of life and 
displaying plenty of good ol’ American 
patriotism. While all of this may be 
expected from a presidential newbie, 

Obama took a unique angle when he 
spoke of how every decision he and 
Congress will make plays an important 
role in shaping the challenges future 
generations will inherit. For better or 
worse, when a leader refers to future 
generations, he is talking about college 
kids. That’s right, when you look 
around at your fellow Tritons you are 
gazing at people who are (hopefully) 
willing and capable to dig us out of this 
current mess. 

With this in mind, I was happy 
to have a flyer shoved into my hand 
advertising a debate between the 
College Republicans and Democrats 
mid-Library Walk last week. 
Apparently, the respective leaders of 
the major political clubs on campus 
were ready to heed Obama’s call; 
possibly to debate new ways our 
society could handle global warming, 
the economy and civil rights. 

I arrived at the event not 
knowing what to expect. While my 
loose affiliation with the College 
Democrats had taught me they were 
well intentioned, I had never seen any 
proof they could handle the rigors of a 
political debate. And the only College 
Republican contingent I have ever seen 
is one lonely dude sitting by himself at 
a booth on Library Walk. 

I was shocked to walk into Warren 
Lecture Hall and find there was only 
standing room. Both sides had done 
a good job of advertising the debate 
and it was encouraging to see students 
taking an interest in politics.

The moderator began with the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 
Democratic team spoke first. It agreed 
with Obama’s decision to move several 
brigades away from Iraq and into 
Afghanistan to beat back the Taliban. 
The Republican side responded with 
a typical GOP argument about the 
situation in the region: it was important 
to maximize forces in Iraq to finish 
what we started.

Next was the economy — the issue 
currently dominating all government 
discussion. Surprise, surprise, the 
Democrats advocated Obama’s plans 
to spend lavishly and the Republicans 
suggested eliminating taxes rather than 
raising them. The questions moved 
on to health care, Proposition 8 and

CAREFUL — YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS SHOWING

By Omair Qazi 
Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — A new data-
base that tracks the progress of high-
school students could pay dividends 
in determining the efficacy of aca-
demic programs — though it may 
also put student privacy at risk.

The Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation awarded a $2.9 mil-
lion grant to the National Student 
Clearinghouse in February to cre-
ate a national database tracking the 
performance of high-school students.

The grant is designed to help close 
a critical data gap in understanding 
student performance and strengthen-
ing the links between secondary and 
postsecondary education, according 
to Vicki L. Phillips, director of edu-
cation at the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation. Essentially, the database 
would allow high schools to under-
stand how well they’ve prepared their 
students for collegiate success.

The National Center for Education 
Statistics (part of the Department 
of Education) currently uses the 
Integrated Postsecondary Education 
Data System. This program is com-
prised of over 10,000 institutions that 
provide data on enrollment, program 
completion, graduation rates and 

financial aid. But the system can’t 
track every school. 

Attempts to rectify IPEDS’s short-
comings were suggested in a 2005 
report by NCES. Proposed changes 
included linking a student’s Social 
Security number with date of birth, 
ethnicity and gender as well as keep-
ing tabs on any financial aid received 
from federal, state and institutional 
sources. 

More troubling was how the report 
addressed privacy concerns. Though 
it acknowledged 
the sensitive nature 
of the tracking sys-
tem, the report 
insisted that NCES 
had never improp-
erly disclosed a case; 
it would be in full 
compliance with the 
Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy 
Act, which main-
tains what informa-
tion can and cannot be disclosed 
without the permission of the stu-
dent. This simplistic rationale for 
why students should not be wor-
ried is no iron-clad guarantee that 
data theft will not happen, and does 
not explain what measures would be 
taken to alert students that their data 
may have been stolen.

If our federal government created 
a database at the national level, it 
would provide educators with helpful 
interstate comparisons. Assessments 
could measure SAT prep course effi-
ciency or alert them if a significant 
number of students in a certain col-

lege are struggling with advanced 
coursework. Presently, educators 
must use databases that don’t have a 
standard set of data and are poorly 
connected across state lines — mak-
ing nationwide educational assess-
ments difficult.

For the 2008-09 academic year, 
portions of the changes proposed 
in 2007 are mandatory, though the 
collection of Social Security numbers 
was deferred. A significant change 
would require colleges to include how 

well their students 
score on internal 
tests used to evalu-
ate performance. 
This is an accept-
able first step. But 
these numbers will 
only have meaning 
for specific colleges. 
This process must 
be standardized in 
some way to under-
stand performance 

across different institutions.
Both National Student 

Clearinghouse and the NCES say they 
are in full compliance with education 
privacy laws, but the specific language 
of the law itself may remain off-put-
ting to many privacy advocates. 

Current regulations allow third-
party organizations to access student 
records without consent. Maintaining 
this policy is acceptable in the interest 
of efficiency, though students must 
know that their information could be 
shared — and they must be able to 
opt out of the tracking program. It’s 
also critical that all personally iden-

tifiable information be purged within 
five years of a student’s graduation. 
There’s no need to maintain personal 
data after the student has left college, 
and exposing students to the possi-
bility of identity theft is unfair given 
the data that they are providing for 
researchers. 

Though the benefits of an expand-
ed IPEDS are clear, the use of Social 
Security numbers or student IDs can-
not be allowed, as identity theft is 
a serious concern in the digital age. 
Any national database must use alter-
nate IDs that have no connection to a 
student outside of their educational 
records. They should be protected as 
rigorously as Social Security numbers 
are under the law. 

The impasse between educa-
tors and privacy advocates must 
be resolved in the interest of bet-
ter understanding the successes and 
failures of our education system. 
Educators need better tools to track 
and develop programs that allow 
more students to succeed in higher 
education, but the privacy concerns 
are equally valid. Having a complete 
record of every class taken by every 
student could potentially be used to 
evaluate students in ways not origi-
nally intended for research, illustrat-
ing the importance of who gets access 
to the data and for what purposes 
it is used. But if administrators can 
protect and restrict access to sensitive 
data, an expanded database should be 
provided at the federal level. 

Readers can contact Omair Qazi at 
oqazi@ucsd.edu.

A proposed student 
tracking system could 
help educators, but 
would sacrifice 
individual privacy.

The use of Social 
Security numbers ... 
cannot be allowed, 
as identity theft is a 

serious concern.

to distance themselves from their 
disgraced former president. By the 
time accusations of lying, racism and 
bigotry started flying around, it was 
officially a true American political 
spectacle.

As I excused myself from the 
Q&A session featuring audience 
members who wanted to join 
the debate rather than ask actual 
questions, I worriedly remembered 
Obama’s statements about the 
future being in the hands of coming 
generations. 

I believe the most important thing 
about Obama is his ability to inspire 

political participation in our nation’s 
youth. Here and now we’re given the 
chance to take control of our country 
— not with the worn-out ideologies 
of current politicians, but with fresh, 
innovative ideas. The students who 
were involved in the debate deserve 
credit for taking the initiative to create 
a forum where these issues can be 
discussed. Many of the participants 
were well-informed and passionate. 
They had the chance to show that 
youth on both sides of the ideological 
spectrum are brimming with new 
ideas and ready to leave failing 
policies behind. But instead, they 
recreated the same old partisan battles 

that limit our political system and 
hinder what our society can achieve. 
That’s not to say there are plenty of 
young people who are volunteering 
for outstanding programs like Teach 
for America or dedicating themselves 
to nonprofit groups that are on the 
brink of solving pressing problems.

It’s important to have a forum 
for young people with differing 
views, but we should be conscious 
that soon enough we’ll be the ones 
coming up with new ideas. That’s 
why I’m looking forward to the next 
event. I just hope that next time 
somebody will have something new 
to say. 

Dear Editor,
Taxing and regulating marijuana 

makes sense. Drug policies modeled 
after alcohol prohibition have given 
rise to a youth-oriented black mar-
ket. Drug dealers don’t ID for age, 
but they do recruit minors immune 
to adult sentences. So much for 
protecting the children. Throwing 
more money at the problem is no 
solution.  Attempts to limit the sup-
ply of illegal drugs only increase 
the profitability of drug trafficking. 
For addictive drugs like heroin, a 
spike in street prices leads desperate 
addicts to increase criminal activity 
to feed desperate habits.

The drug war doesn’t fight crime, 
it fuels crime. Taxing and regulating 
marijuana, the most popular illicit 
drug, is a cost-effective alternative 
to a never-ending drug war. As long 
as marijuana distribution remains 
in the hands of organized crime, 
consumers will come into contact 
with sellers of addictive drugs like 
methamphetamines. This “gateway” 
is a direct result of marijuana pro-
hibition. Students who want to help 
end the intergenerational culture 
war — otherwise known as the war 
on some drugs — should contact 
Students for Sensible Drug Policy at

Common Sense for Drug Policy

Dear Editor,
In light of your article (“Another 

Hurdle for Hillel”) on the California 
Court of Appeal’s decision regard-
ing Hillel of San Diego’s Jewish 

Student Center project, Taxpayers 
for Responsible Land Use would like 
to provide the following comments:

The City of San Diego’s Planning 
Commission has twice recommend-
ed denial of the project based on 
inappropriate location and inade-
quate parking.

The California Court of Appeal 
considered Hillel of San Diego’s 
appeal of a San Diego Superior 
Court ruling that invalidated the 
project’s 2006 Mitigated Negative 
Declaration. A principal issue before 
the Court of Appeal was whether, 
under the California Environmental 
Quality Act, the proposed project 
requires a full Environmental Impact 
Report or can be accommodated 
by a more cursory MND. TRLU 
believes that an EIR was required 
and the Court of Appeal concurred.

And TRLU expects that an EIR 
will demonstrate the unsuitability of 
the proposed location. Although the 
Court of Appeal did not reverse the 
sale of the land by the city to Hillel 
of San Diego, it did agree with TRLU 
that the City of San Diego wasted 
taxpayers’ money by selling the site 
to Hillel of San Diego at a price that 
was substantially below market value 
and that the Superior Court’s judg-
ment on this matter was erroneous 
and must be reversed.

FOOLPROOF 
GUIDE TO THE 

ULTIMATE 
DANCE PARTY

T o cop some wisdom from my main man Andre 3000, things sure have changed since the 
days when you were cool if you were 
pigeon-toed — no, it ain’t so simple 
— life is a [motherfucking] musical.

Kids may have had it pretty tough 
back then, trekking five miles uphill 
in the snow to the portapotty-sized 
schoolhouse and back, but I’d make 

the case that fringe rebellion was way 
cinchier in the old days — just grow 
your hair out, spout some Ginsberg, 
blow some cigarette rings and call it 
a sit-in. Nowadays, simply brooding 
in the corner behind your beret won’t 
fool anybody; the real modern-day 
rebels, the beautiful losers of the digi-
tal age, have to be more than human 
— we have to be dancer.

OK, pretend I didn’t just refer-
ence the Killers. In my defense, it 
was more of a retort to a suggestion 
once made by Hunter S. Thompson 
that our nation was raising a whole 
bunch of mindless dancers — like, 
all waxing Americana and stepping 
to the same tune. My reply will be 
delivered via pigeon-toed dance-off 
challenge, 5 a.m. sharp, 24th floor of 
the Flamingo, Las Vegas. Be there.

Anyway, this new anonymous axis 
of dark artists, costume-chest hip-
sters and copyright-infringing punks 
on which we rotate, elbow to elbow, 
is so massively uniform that a well-
orchestrated dance party is one of 
the only places left to demonstrate a 
proud, rebellious ego. Until, of course, 
everyone catches onto the appeal and 
leaves their brood puddle in the corner 
to join you where the purple party 
light is strongest. At which point the 
ego should be happily abandoned — 
because that, my friends, is dance-
party mission accomplished.

Here’s where I can be of come ser-
vice. As crappy musicals are a dime a 
dozen, I’ve compiled somewhat of a 
how-to, for purposes of avoiding that 
cheap fate — just a skeleton, really, to 
get you started.

To begin: the playlist. Almost too 
easy. Anytime you hear a song and feel 
anything — from a tremor to a trill to a 
full-on soul seizure — jot it down and 
’load that shit. You live in a moment 
when llegal distribution is major par-
tytime, and the torrents are fucking 
Santa Claus. Do be careful, though, 
not to get too ambitious; just because 
“The Seed 2.0” has the bangin’est beat 
this side of the cancer cluster doesn’t 
mean the rest of Phrenology will even 
raise you half-mast. 

A long-lived, properly climaxing 
dance party is all about pacing the 
foreplay, and never expecting stand-
ersby to divulge their familiarity with 
Boyz II Men — preferably on the car-
pet, with feigned, arch-backed stabs 
to the heart — until they’re hot, heavy 
and plastered in sweat beads way too 
boozy to blow anything under a 1.0.

Which brings us to phase one: the 
well-thought-out stuff (but definitely 
not the best, because that’s for later). If

an on-fire Ethiopian honey exploding

T he first single off Kelly Clarkson’s much-anticipated All I Ever Wanted, “My Life Would Suck Without You” begins with the same amping strums of “Since U Been Gone,” escalating to that 
familiar rubbed-raw, girl-gone-bad holler. But for anyone who indul-
gently blasted the breakup hit for some underwear-dancing empower-
ment in ’05, the followup is a disappointment. Instead of venging the 
ex, Clarkson goes all pussy on us, confessing she was “stupid/ For tryin’ 
to say goodbye.” Even with its L.A. electro-polish, all that love-torn 
yelling can’t match the window-shattering force that first drove the 
American Idol into our sleepover parties. But her sincere efforts are 
still enough to pick up the pieces of 2007’s flop My December — “My 
Life” snagged 280k digital downloads during its first week of release. If 
only she knew that all we really want is a remix with David Archuleta.

U nderwhelming is an overstatement for “Get On Your Boots,” U2’s latest from the just-released  No Line on the Horizon, and its spacey music video 
only hammers another nail into their impending cof-
fin. Bono leans like a rocking chair, the Edge fake-riffs 
karaoke style, Adam hamfists the bass, Larry bangs on 
the same old pots — it ain’t gonna cut it for fans bred 
on heartbreak anthems and punk-edged outcries. But 
Bono won’t quit without our approval. “Let me in the 
sound!” he screams over and over, transporting a group 
known for risk-taking grandeur on an atmospheric 
backtrack into the days of Unforgettable Fire, more a 
frenetic midlife crisis than anything resembling a classic.

A lex Chiu still hasn’t slept.It’s afternoon, and he’s been in Starbucks since 5 a.m. He sips a Venti coffee cup while brushing eraser crumbs 
off a new sketch — a manic, googly-eyed monster 
doodle. Towels, ballpoint pens and clothes crowd 
his corner table. Shut out of his house for the next 
three days (damn fumigation), but he scribbles away 
at his new studio.

Since graduating from UCSD in 2007, Chiu 
has been drawing nonstop. He just signed with 
Volcom to do a design for its spring 2010 girls line 
and published a book through Neko Press that has 
been featured at three comic conventions and over 
100 other tabling events. He’s a freelance designer, 
Frappuccino maker, painter for Groundwork Books 

and wants a graphic novel by next year (the impos-
sible deadline: 10 pages per month). He also plans 
to walk from San Diego to San Francisco with a few 
artist friends, and shoot a feature length film before 
he turns 30.

Every half hour, a curious coworker passes by 
the small table, offering condolences or their couch. 
Chiu declines with a smile — the displacement’s just 
a test drive for July, when he’ll head a full-scale East 
Coast concert tour with post-punkers Jim McCray 
and the New Sorrows, who spotted the classically 
trained violinist at an impromptu jam at Porter’s 
Pub, where he says their weird, experimental mad-
ness just clicked. 

That’s how it is with Chiu: Even though his art 
is highly individualized, he’s all about the people; 

in fact, every artist fea-
tured at his March 6 
event is a personal pal. 
“Let’s Get Loose!!!” is 
a sample of his dream 
universe: collaboration 
between creators, a free 
exchange of ideas and 
unbounded expression.

“I don’t even care 

about exhibition,” he says. “I don’t even care about 
my artwork! It’s the process and the people and the 
relationships and the experiences that make being 
an artist worth it. You know, when you’re done 
making a piece, it looks cool. But there’s so much 
cool-looking stuff in the world. A leaf is cool to look 
at. The clouds are cool to look at. Man can’t really 
make anything that hasn’t been made in nature, 
you know?”

One glance at Chiu’s ultra-surrealist, Dada-
inspired creations and you might disagree. Candy-
colored swirls, grotesque blobs and anime cues 
compose an artist’s universe unlike anything else 
on the comic scene — tiny, adorable monsters 
cavorting in oft unforgiving worlds. In one piece, 
Chiu’s skinny kid gives a misunderstood dragon 
an ice-cream cone, his characteristic peace and 
love extending into the realm of social justice. Two 
particluar pieces proclaim, “Justice to the different” 
and “Race is a construct.” Although he admits to 
over-listening to Dead Prez and glancing over his 
girlfriend’s civi-rights literature, Chiu insists the 
messages aren’t conscious gestures.

“I respect Jesus as a man, Buddha as a man,”

‘1001’ TAKES A MAGIC CARPET RIDE FROM NY TO ARABIA

By Leila Haghighat
Staff Writer

A li Baba had forty thieves; Scheherazade had a thousand tales; now, we have playwright Jason Grote’s “1001” — a postmodernist, 
street-rat revamp of Middle Eastern legends.
With the aid of a thundering time machine, the 
fantasy careens from ancient Persia to post-9/11 
New York, allegorizing the cyclical trends of 
war-torn history.

Premiering at Mandel Weiss Forum Studio — 
in snug quarters with makeshift seats — “1001” is 
a sweeping magic carpet ride above a whirlwind 
of costume and character changes. The cogent 
seven-actor cast swiftly moves from fairytale 
narrative into the anachronistic, antic cameos 
of Jorge Luis Borges, Alan Dershowitz, Gustave 
Flaubert and, yes, Osama bin Laden (a source of 
diabolical laughter, terrorizing not with weapons 
of mass destruction but with a high-pitched nar-
ration of Vincent Price’s “Thriller”).  

From the beginning, we are bombarded us 

with the play’s take-home message: “There’s 
only one story ... space comprised of every word 
that has ever been or ever will be uttered.” 

The tongue-in-cheek introduction veils 
the true moroseness of its thematic undercur-
rents. Witness to his queen’s adultery, an impish 
King Shahriyar (the wonderfully pouty Hugo 
Medina) vows to marry a virgin, then deflower 
and behead her, in order to absolve himself of a 
“cesspool of iniquity.”

Prefacing the play’s deft abandonment of 
the time continuum, “1001” adopts “Monty 
Python” spoonerisms and malapropisms (“I am 
genital. Gentile! No, gentle!”) in his bedtime 
escapades. Adding to the absurdity are shadows 
of hilariously explicit body wiggles and pushups 
projected against the stark backdrop as the king 
religiously marinates his kabob.

Archetypal female trickster Scheherazade 
(masterful Rebecca Lawrence) then condemns 
her father, the vizier (Daniel Rubiano), for his 
timid submission to the king. “You lack the 
courage to save our lives and his.” she rebuffs 
in holier-than-thou contempt. Scheming her 
own salvation, Schederazade spins the well-
worn tales of “Arabian Nights” into a trap for 

the king while slapstick duo Zoë Chao and 
Adam Arian animate the likes of Aladdin 
and Sinbad on stage. Each story emerges 
from within the former like a Babushka 
doll. Scheherazade (literally, “liberator of 
the city”) entices Shahriyar to postpone her 
beheading with the false promise that she’ll 
finally complete her fables.

So begins Grote’s meanderings, entering 
Escher’s warped space of overlapping timeframes 
and plotlines. We land ultimately in a world of 
“granola bars and air freshener” at Columbia 
University, wrapped up in the tottery relation-
ship between liberal Jewish graduate student 
Alan and his Palestinian girlfriend, Dahna — 
reincarnations of Shahriyar and Scheherazade, 
played duly by Medina and Lawrence. As politi-
cal turmoil escalates, the frays of their relation-
ship grow taut. Regardless of the play’s modern 
political undertones, director Kim Rubinstein 
still envisions “1001” as a testament to love. 

“I have a great belief that all politics start 
from the human heart,” she said at the after how 
Q&A. “It starts domestically — the way we treat 
other moment to moment, the way we treat each 
other day to day. We either treat people coldly as 
encounters, or we treat things with immediate 
judgment. And the hope is that we eventually 
perceive the lighter side of the person — that’s 
what you see in the play.”

But underscoring its character parallels and 
motifs — blue linen, at once Shahriyar’s drap-

ery, morphs into oceanic abyss and, suddenly, a 
Gaza baby’s blanketing — is the play’s grandiose 
eulogy of storytelling itself, and the tug-of-war 
between destiny and free will. In all her sagacity, 
Dahna reasons to Alan that they’re “trapped in 
this grand narrative” maybe trying to defy that 
narrative, or reinvent it.” 

But an overambitious moral agenda is 
ultimately the play’s most tragic flaw. Both in 
ancient empire and intra-Middle Eastern war-
fare, “1001” barrages us with far too many 
themes that list off like Supreme Court cases — 
man v. woman, antiquity v. modernity, Western 
liberality v. Eastern traditionalism, Palestine v. 
Israel — for a panoply of virtues, as cloying at 
times as baklava. 

Yet this syrupy sweetness comes packed with 
energetic performances, offering a surrealistic 
mind-body experience. Echoing the play’s noth-
ing-is-accidental ideology, Rubinstein recalled 
the cast’s concerted effort at “working physi-
cally, working so that they’re not only telling 
the story just through their mouths but through 
their whole beings and their bodies, through 
gesture and shape and floor patterns and tempo 
— all to tell the stories … like an electrical field 
between everybody.” 

This field arises, in large part, from a mag-
netizing fusion of mystical Persian music and 
the harsh edginess of more modern R&B and 
Western pop. From within sultry Sufi verses in 
Farsi erupts a Bollywood beat, unveiling a kalei-
doscope of richly hued Islamic garb and kurtas. 

“1001” capitalizes on the universal appeal 
of those traditional sounds, galvanizing the 
audience with transciendant, rhythmic pulses 
of the tanbur and breathy serenades of the ney, 
melting into their electro-pop counterparts in 
Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” An inebriating senti-
mentalism then suspends us as the gushy lyrics 
of Landon Pigg and Andrew Bird unfurl over 
the speakers, supplementing Dahna and Alan’s 
courtship. 

What Rubinstein’s adaptation also engen-
ders is a visually mesmerizing set that, in fully 
engaging its audience, harkens back to Dahna’s 
rhetorical question: “What are any one of us but 
a collection of stories?” Each of the interlinked 
“aquapods,” full water bottles that symbolize 
each of the king’s beheaded virgins, reflect light 
in prismatic shafts across the stage. 

In weaving its political and temporal themes, 
“1001” simultaneously unravels the tenets 
of traditional storytelling. It blurs the lines 
between ancient lore and reality by immersing 
us in a whole new world, providing a theatrical 
experience that is shining, shimmering and, 
quite simply, splendid.

“It’s a drug in itself,” he says. “You have to 
understand, that’s why I do it. Like, who sits 
down for five hours and draws. You know? It’s 
a high in itself. It creates itself, and I don’t really 
feel like I do much. I draw eyes and teeth, hands, 
hair, whatever. And something appears. And I 
surprise myself.”

THE WEEK’S BEST BETS    druthers 

Tom Jones

The Belly-Up celebrates its 35th 
birthday with tuxedoed lady killer 
Tom Jones. If you sneak in the sold-
out show, expect gaggles of sweaty, 
middle-aged women tossing their 
panties onstage by the fistful — 
this sex bomb’s been around since 
the ’60s, and his engine’s still 
purring smooth. While the sultry 
tracks off last year’s 24 Hours will  
undoubtedly draw their fair share 
of swoons, that classic, climactic 
moan in “It’s Not Unusual” is bound 
to make ’em flat-out faint. (SM)  

BELLY-UP TAVERN / MARCH 9 / $97

“Che”

A couple of years after the airbrushed 
“Motorcycle Diaries,” we finally get a 
biopic that doesn’t veil the ugly realities 
of Latin-American revolution with Cold 
War anxieties. With a two-part release 
at 90 minutes apiece, “Che” — Steven 
Soderbergh’s latest hard-hitter — 
doesn’t dole out easy answers or cater 
to mainstream needs. Instead, “Che” 
depicts the Cuban Revolution as a hopeful 
beginning for what ended in one man’s 
martyrdom, garnering Benicio del Toro the 
best actor award at the Cannes. (EG)

Adaptation Stays (Mostly) True to Chilling Comic
By Philip Rhie
Staff Writer

W hen comic books first began being pub-lished, they were condemned as poison: rather than recognizing their potential, the 
literati snubbed the inked strips as the beginning 
of the end of imagination. Even today, graphic 
novels still carry the stigma of being lowbrow art. 
So when Time included “Watchmen” in their list 
of 100 greatest novels, the world took note. The 
only comic on the list proved a compelling decon-
struction of the modern hero, challenging notions 
of justice within the ambiguities of good and evil. 

“Watchmen” is very much a comic’s comic, 
celebrating the many potentials of the medium. 
That creator Alan Moore and many others have 
deemed the tale unfilmable, then, is no surprise. 
Since the comic’s debut, filmmakers like imaginist 
Terry Gilliam and modernist Darren Aronofsky 
have passed on the ambitious project; almost 
two decades later the unfilmable has at last been 
filmed, by none other than Zack Snyder — a 
director whose Hollywood credentials include a 
homoerotic Spartan war and a zombie apocalypse.

While Snyder’s “300” lacked any real plot, 
the movie set a new standard for visual story-
telling, imbuing yet unseen stylistic techniques. 
Likewise, “Dawn of the Dead,” though ridicu-
lous, was at least enjoyably so. 

Still, Snyder’s a far cry from the “visionary” 
that Warner Bros. has deemed him. Luckily for us, 
though, he’s got some damn good source mate-
rial to work with, and the translation isn’t half 
bad. From its very beginning, “Watchmen” sets 
an ominous precedent with the brutal murder 
of Edward Blake, the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean 
Morgan), transitioning into brilliantly eerie open-
ing credits played to the tune of Bob Dylan’s “The 
Times They Are a-Changin’,” while a twisted real-
ity of costumed vigilantes swims past. 

Seeing as “Watchmen” is mostly a character 
study, the film’s success hinges largely on its superb 
cast performances. Morgan’s character, while only 

physically existing in the first half of the movie, 
resonates throughout — he manages to imitate 
Blake’s nihilism while humanizing an otherwise 
inhumane personality. Jackie Earle Haley’s turn 
as the merciless Rorschach is similarly a thing of 
beauty, a dual depiction of both Rorschach and 
Walter Kovaks that seems uncannily lifted from 
the inked pages. And above all, Billy Crudup’s Dr. 
Manhattan steals the show with a god-like swagger 
that thunders with terrifyingly realism.

Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) and Dan 
Drieberg (Patrick Wilson) are the film’s weakest 
relationship, gruelingly developed by Akerman — 
who, rather than breathing life into her character 
like the potent Crudup, remains as one-dimen-
sional as a graphic novel cutout — and Wilson, 
who delivers a polarizingly over-the-top theatrical 
performance deviating from the film’s grim tone. 

Though his meticulous reproduction largely 
comes out on top, occasional deviations become 
jarring. Though literally translating a novel’s enor-
mity is impossible, the scenes Snyder does choose 
are baffling; for instance, a confrontation between 
Jupiter and Blake is cut from the print version, 
while an unnecessary five-minute fight sequence 
of Spartan proportions is preserved. Likewise, 
various scenes racked in  excessive gore distance 
rather than immerse an already restless audience. 
The only deviation that doesn’t feel unnatural is 
“Watchmen”’s most publicized change: its ending. 

Constantly teetering between severity and all-
out camp, this comic-book blowout is ground-
breaking at times and downright silly at others — 
and sitting at a bloated runtime of 90 minutes, its 
schizophrenia does get distracting. Whether or 
not the film gains our good graces due to source 
material or novel cinematography choices is hard 
to determine. If even devoted fans feel estranged 
by the film’s climax, we wonder how the average 
moviegoer will find it in themselves to accept it. 
One thing is certain: “Watchmen” is an adapta-
tion for the ages; whether or not it will maintain 
the same cultural relevance as its 2D counterpart 
remains to be seen.

Directed by Zack Snyder

Rated R

Porter’s Pub Presents: 

Let’s Get Loose!!!
Music and Art Show

Friday, March 6th, 7PM-11PM @ Porter’s Pub
Featuring: Alex Chiu and Guest Artists

Plus Musical Special Guests:
The New Sorrows, Satan Dance Party and Residual

Free and all ages!

Pawn off Your Pearls for a White Man’s Overbite
yours is a theme party, this portion could craftily 
adhere, but never expect the Great Gatsby jazz 
playlist to last too long — stream-of-conscious-
ness shimmies are only hilarious until they’re 
not, and just because everyone arrives in pearls 
doesn’t mean they won’t soon be overcome by the 
Daisy-gone-wild fantasy. (Sexy shit like Lovage 
or the Avalanches could really work some magic 
here. And hit the lights already.)

Phase two: sharp spike of humor. Nothing’s 
better than some funky-chicken flaps and ass 
slaps to them Bay raps and assorted junior-high 
crap, especially while everyone’s still sober enough 
to think on their toes. This is a great segue for all 
us art farts, because we can whip out the white 
man’s overbite and pretend it’s all in irony, maybe 
even dropping Dane Cook’s “No boys — I just 

wanna dance!”  as if it weren’t the fucking truth.
Phase three: the grind. Everyone’s warmed up, 

unashamed and ready for what can be, if prefaced 
correctly, the euphoric r.e.m. stage of the dance-
party cycle. Think “What You Know,” O-Zone, 
Camplo, “Family Affair,” old Britney — really, 
whatever’s been driving you the craziest. (I guess 
if you’re into deathmetalsatancore, this could be 
substituted by the bat head-eater of all screaming 
guitar solos, or whatever you freaks dig these 
days. Just do your thang, honey.) By the end, 
everyone’s so in the zone that the world’s hottest 
synthlines can be best streamlined with a little bit 
of chop suey from Girl talk or Hollertronix; after 
all, the only thing better than Dre 3K chilling next 
to M.I.A. is Dre 3K on top of M.I.A., with some 
Ying Yang Twins from behind.

Next week: Phasing out; working the jukebox.

support of nearly 1,000 fans — the 
largest home crowd this season — the 
shorter UCSD front managed to out-
block UCLA by a 12.0 to 10.5 margin, 
with sophomore middle back Calvin 
Ross accumulating six of the Tritons’ 
blocks.

“Going into the game, we knew 
we had a great chance to get a win,” 
sophomore setter Phil Bannan said. 
“Beating them last year at home and 
having a close match with them earli-
er this year gave us the confidence we 
needed to win [on Saturday]. Playing 
at home is always nice, especially 
when there is a big crowd.”

Ehrman was once again huge 
for the Tritons with a match-high 
14 kills on .458 hitting. Junior out-
side hitter Jason Spangler added 12 
kills of his own. Senior middle back 
Gerald Houseman had a solid nine 
kills on .571 hitting and four blocks. 
Sophomore setter Phil Bannan had 
a very well-rounded game with 44 
assists, three aces and five blocks.

“This win reaffirms that we can 
play with any of the teams out there 
in our league,” Ehrman said. “We’re 
going to need a good week of practice 
and hopefully we can do well against 
Pepperdine and USC.”

 UCSD came out with a bang in 
the first set, opening up to a 20-12 
lead on .517 hitting. The Bruins never 
led in the set, setting the Tritons up 
for a big night with the 30-21 win. 

The second set was back and forth 
early — tied five times — before the 
Tritons took control. With the set tied 

at seven, UCSD pulled away with four 
straight points on Houseman serves, 
aided by two Spangler kills, for an 
11-7 lead, but the Bruins were held off 
late as the Tritons took the set 30-23. 

A tug of war would best describe 
the third set, as it included 16 ties and 
seven lead changes. UCLA put up a 
strong fight, taking a 15-12 lead early 
in the set, desperate to avoid a Triton 
sweep. The Tritons soon pulled even 
after a Spangler ace and an Ehrman 
kill. After a 20-20 tie, UCLA regained 
the lead, scoring consecutive points 
on a kill and a UCSD error. 

After a UCSD timeout, the Tritons 
scored the next four points, including 
a crucial block by Ross and Bannan, 
to lead 24-22. With the score again 
tied, Ehrman sent down a kill to force 
a match point. After a service error, a 
UCSD attack error gave the Bruins a 
30-29 lead. However, a UCLA attack 
error followed by a Spangler kill 
turned the tables for the Tritons, put-
ting them on top 31-30. The Tritons 
held on to seal the sweep at 33-31. 

The Tritons had completely oppo-
site results against the No. 2 Anteaters, 
falling in three straight sets 30-25, 
30-28 and 30-24. UCSD was outhit 
.418 to .144 and outblocked by a 
whopping 13.5 blocks — the Tritons 
only recorded two — which proved to 
be the difference in the game. 

“We had a tough loss against UCI, 
but we came into [the UCLA] game 
confident that we could get a much 
needed win,” Ehrman said of the 
UCLA win. “We played some amaz-
ing defense [against UCLA] both 

blocking and playing in the back row 
... The crowd was a huge part of that 
win as they kept us going with con-
stant energy.”

Against the Anteaters, UCSD came 
out flat in the first set, falling behind 
by five. The Tritons cut the lead to 
20-17 after a Houseman kill, forc-
ing a UC Irvine timeout. Hoping to 
increase their lead coming out of the 
timeout, the Anteaters were instead 
greeted by two Triton points on an 
error and a kill from junior opposite 
Frank Fritsch to tighten the score at 
21-20. However, UC Irvine never let 
the Tritons tie the game, eventually 
winning the set 30-25.

The second set featured nine tied 
scores and was the closest of the night. 
The Tritons trailed early 10-7, but 
rallied back to tie the game at 13 
after Fritsch and Ehrman kills. UC 
Irvine responded with another four 
point run to put the score at 17-13. 
The Tritons battled back hard to tie 
the game at 22, but the Anteaters 
took the lead on a kill and a block. 
UCSD would tie the set late, but a 
Triton error and an Irvine kill gave the 
Anteaters the match point. 

UC Irvine took control in the third 
set, dominating early on for a 20-13 
lead that it never relinquished.

The Tritons head back into MPSF 
action as they host two tough oppo-
nents in No. 5 USC (11-4) and No. 
3 Pepperdine (10-2) on March 6 and 
March 7 at RIMAC Arena.

a three-pointer off a Husted assist. 
Lawley helped UCSD grab a 15-point 
advantage, drawing a foul and knock-
ing down two from the line. The 
Lumberjacks cut the Triton lead 
down to eight, but UCSD was able to 
bury them in a game-high 17-point 
deficit after a three from Lawley. 
As the team’s leading scorer at 13.5 
per game, Lawley scored all nine 
of UCSD’s points in a three-minute 
stretch that started with seven min-
utes remaining. 

“We had to come out with a win,” 
Lawley said. “None of the seniors are 
ready to give up the season, and we 
kind of went out there and played for 
them. We have seven of them going 
away and every game right now is 
for them.”

UCSD went cold from the field 
with under four minutes in the game, 
scoring only one point on a Kim free 
throw as the Lumberjacks closed the 
gap to six. The Tritons once again 
demonstrated their ability to make 
crucial free throws down the stretch 
as Kim, Husted, Lawley and Poppen 
each hit from the line and Lawlor 
came up with a block and steal in the 
final minute to seal the victory.

“Our goal was to chase [the 
Lumberjacks] off the three-point 

line and force them into contested 
jumpers,” Lawlor said. “They are a 
physical team, but we took the fight 
to them. It was our goal to be tougher 
than them and tonight I think we 
were.”

Humboldt struggled offensively, 
shooting 35.7 percent from the field. 
Tiedman was held to eight points on 
1-for-6 field goal shooting, including 
0-for-3 from beyond the arc. The 
Tritons were better than 50 percent 
from the field for the second straight 
game, including 11-for-19 in the sec-
ond half. 

“We’re a little different [than last 
year’s CCAA Championship Triton 
squad],” Carlson said. “We’ve got our 
own identity. I think we’re actually 
a little better defensively, probably 
rely a little bit more on our defense 
and our rebounding than we did last 
year. I think when you do that, you 
have the opportunity to have success 
every night.”

UCSD was paced by 18 points 
from Husted, who also finished 
with four assists and five rebounds. 
Poppen recorded a double-double of 
16 points and 12 boards, Lawley also 
sank 16 and Kim had 15 points with 
a game-high five assists. Lawlor came 
up big off the bench, tallying five 
points, five assists, three rebounds 

and three steals.
“We knew for sure this was our 

last home game and we went in 
with the mentality that it’s win or 
go home, and we don’t want to go 
home,” Husted said. “Biggest thing 
we can take from tonight, is we feel 
that we can beat any team. We’re not 
done.”

Following the game, three Triton 
players were honored with All-CCAA 
recognition for the first time in their 
careers. Kim was named to the first 
team after averaging 11.3 points and 
a team-high 3.8 assists. Poppen’s 11.1 
points and 7.7 rebounds, and Lawley’s 
13.4 points and 3.5 rebounds earned 
second-team recognition.

The defending conference 
champions now turn their atten-
tion to second-seeded Cal State San 
Bernardino, the CCAA’s highest scor-
ing and co-regular season champion. 
The Tritons and Coyotes face off 
at 8 p.m. on Friday at Coussoulis 
Arena, with the winner advancing 
to the CCAA Championship Game 
on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. All UCSD

TRITONS ADVANCE TO CCAA SEMIFINALS
By Joe Tevelowitz

MEN’S BASKETBALL —  The Tritons made sure to leave 
RIMAC Arena on a high note after their final home game 
of the 2008-09 season, and the final collegiate home 
game of seven seniors’ careers. Competing in their first 
Division-II playoff game at home, the fourth-seeded 
Tritons defeated fifth-seeded Humboldt State by a 79-67 
final score on March 3 in the first round of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament. With the 
win, UCSD improves to 17-10 overall, advancing to the 
CCAA Tournament Semifinals where the Tritons will face 
host Cal State San Bernardino on March 6.

“RIMAC provides a special environment for all of us 
seniors, especially getting to see such a great fan base 
evolve and become our sixth man out there on the court,” 
senior forward Darryl Lawlor said. “I personally have so 
many great memories of great games out there on the 
court.”

The home fans 
were treated to 
another early UCSD 
lead on Tuesday, 
with junior guards 
Jordan Lawley and 
Tyler Acevedo each 
connecting from behind the arc in the opening minutes 
to help key an early five-point lead. Humboldt State’s 
offense quickly tied the game with 12:06 in the half and 
took its first lead with 11:19 remaining. After UCSD 
regained the lead on a three pointer from Lawley, the 
Lumberjacks responded with a triple of their own. 

“Humboldt does a really good job of making the game 
up-tempo,” head coach Chris Carlson said. “We didn’t 
do a good job at times. We really kind of got caught up, 
forced some things, didn’t handle the ball well at times. I 
think it comes back to that senior leadership and knowing 
how to handle [the game] in those situations.”

With the Tritons down by two, Lawlor turned a pass 
from senior center Brett Stuckey into a quick layup to tie 
the game at 23. Stuckey then grabbed a defensive board 
on the other end, leading to a three from senior guard 
Alan Husted. Top scorer Zac Tiedman recaptured the 
lead for Humboldt State following two free throws, put-
ting the Lumberjacks up by one.

“[Humboldt is] always a tough team,” senior forward 
Shane Poppen said. “They play really hard. They’re really 
a free-wheeling team on offense, so you’ve got to be dis-
ciplined on defense.”

Defense proved key as UCSD held the Lumberjacks 
scoreless through the final minutes of the half, while 
Poppen kicked off an 11-0 run with a three-point play. 
The Tritons went into the half up 10, building from the 
free-throw line after working their way into the double-
bonus. 

Senior guard Kelvin Kim started the second half with

Eighth-Seeded Coyotes Shock Tritons With First-Round Defeat

VOLLEYBALL — After eight gruel-
ing games on the road, the Tritons 
(7-10, 4-7 MPSF) returned home last 
week for a tough stretch of Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation matchups. 
Following a disappointing sweep at 
the hands of UC Irvine on Feb. 25, 
the Tritons came back strong against  
No. 9 UCLA on Feb. 28. In front of a 
packed house at RIMAC Arena, the 
Tritons showed the MPSF and the 
nation that they are top notch, sweep-
ing UCLA 30-21, 30-23 and 33-21, 
dropping the Bruins to No. 11 while 
improving their ranking to No. 10.

Both games represent the begin-
ning of a huge stretch of tough con-
ference matchups for UCSD that will 
ultimately decide the Tritons’ post-
season fate. The Tritons have their 
sights set on the playoffs and hope to 
battle through the difficult upcoming 
schedule.  

“We had a tough loss on 
Wednesday against UCI, but we came 
into this game [against UCLA] confi-
dent that we could get a much needed 
win,” redshirt sophomore outside hit-
ter Will Ehrman said. “We played 
some amazing defense in this game 
both blocking and playing in the back 
row. Being in front of a big crowd 
like that made the win all that much 
better. The crowd was a huge part of 
that win as they kept us going with 
constant energy.”

The Tritons are currently in the 
meat of their toughest test of the 
season, scheduled to play five MPSF 
squads consecutively at home, includ-
ing the previous two games against 
UC Irvine and UCLA. Saturday night, 
the Tritons had a tall order as the 
bigger and stronger Bruins stepped 
onto UCSD’s home court. With the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — No. 8 
Cal State San Bernardino delivered the 
first 2009 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Tournament shocker 
when it upset the top-seeded Tritons 
Tuesday evening in the quarterfinals, 
57-62. The loss, which marks the sec-
ond time this season UCSD fell to the 
Coyotes, forfeits the Tritons’ hopes of 
winning a CCAA Tournament title. 
Forced to exit early, the women’s bas-
ketball team, which is currently ranked 
No. 2 in the West Region, now awaits 
Sunday’s decision of the 64-team 
NCAA Tournament field.

UCSD appeared to be on its usual 
road to domination, leading 11-4 seven 
minutes into the first half. But senior 
forward Jaclyn Rainville’s three-point 
play followed by junior guard Krystal 
Urzua’s three pointer trimmed Cal 
State San Bernardino’s deficit to four. 
For the rest of the period, there were 
three ties with the lead never extend-

ing beyond three points. The Tritons 
entered halftime with the score tied.

The second half proved just as tight, 
when senior center Alexis Gaskin’s 
jumper tied the score again at 41 with 
14:50 left to play. UCSD fired off a 9-1 
run to boost its advantage to 50-42. 
The Coyotes answered, outscoring the 
Tritons 14-3, highlighted by Urzua’s 
three pointer that stole the lead at 
56-53. With just under three minutes 
to play, a foul by UCSD allowed sopho-
more guard Lisa Takata to sink a pair 
of free throws and maintain a three-
point advantage. Then, senior center 
Artaishia Waters came through with 
a layup to put the Coyotes up 60-55. 
As the clock dwindled down to 53 sec-
onds, freshman guard Chelsea Carlisle 
notched a jumper to keep the Tritons’ 
hopes alive, but UCSD was forced to 
foul in the final 10 seconds and ceded 
the final two points to free throws, 
allowing Cal State San Bernardino to 
celebrate its unpredicted 62-57 victory. 

“Overall, our one-on-one defense 
just wasn’t good enough,” Osier said. 
“Even after going through their ten-
dencies all week, we allowed too many 
threes and uncontested shots. We sim-
ply need to take more pride in our 
defense. Regional games are going to 
be much tougher than this one.”

Despite the loss, Osier put in 
another outstanding effort with 22 
points, 12 rebounds and five steals. 

Junior guard Leilani Martin chipped 
in with 12 points and four rebounds 
while Gaskin finished with eight points 
and grabbed 12 rebounds. Although 
both teams had similar shooting per-
formances from the field, the Coyotes 
made 75 percent of their free throws, 
compared to UCSD’s 53 percent.

$The Tritons still had something to 
commemorate on Wednesday, learn-
ing that Osier was named the CCAA’s 
Most Valuable Player in addition to 
her fourth straight All-CCAA First 
Team selection. Carlisle was selected as  
Freshman of the Year. Gaskin earned 
her first career all-conference selection. 
Head coach Charity Elliott took home 
Coach of the Year honors.
