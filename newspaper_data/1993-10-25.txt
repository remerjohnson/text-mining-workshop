Minority Enrollment 
Hits High at ucla 
SANTA BARBARA-
University officials pointed to 
a record increase in minority 
enrollment as evidence that 
UCSB is moving toward a 
more accurate reflection of 
California's changing demo-
graphics. "It appears that we 
will have the most diverse total 
student body in the hlslury of 
UCSB," said Institutional 
Research Director Dennis 
Hengstler. According to 
Hengstler, approximately 30 
percent of the UCSB student 
body is composed of ethnic 
minorities. 

Newspaper FlI .. 
SuR Against UCLA 
LOS ANGELES - In an 
attempt to force the university 
to release documents regard-
ing sexual harassment claims 
that the administration 
secretly seuled for more than 
$ 100,000, the Daily Bruin , 
UCLA's student newspaper, 
filed a lawsuit against the 
univers ity with the Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
Editor in Chief Josh Romonek 
arg ued that The Bruill has a 
right to see the disputed fil es 
under the California Public 
Records Act, which requires 
that documents held by public 
institutions be available for 
inspection. The subjects of the 
lawsuit are documents 
involving at least three claims 
of sexual harrassment. 

GSA Opposes Phase

DAVIS - The Graduate 
Student Association at UC 
Davis expressed its concern 
over a Phase III Action Plan 
calling for a merger between 
the graduate studies and 
research offices. "All the 
advantages that have been 
touted for saving money seem 
to be illusory, and we see the 
potential for losing services," 
said GSA co-chairperson 
Mark Heckman.

Blanco Honored at Ceremony 
AWARD: Literature professor 
recognized for his role in the 
founding of Third College 
By Stephanie Simon 
Staff Writer 

Literature Professor Carlos Blanco-
Aguinaga probably has a different perspec-
tive than most people on Friday's Thurgood 
Marshall College dedication ceremony. An 
original faculty member at Third College, 
Blanco-Aguinaga was one of the leaders in 
establishing the college back in the late 1960s. 

For his efforts, Blanco-Aguinaga was hon-
ored at Friday's ceremony with a Lifetime 
Achievement Award from Marshall College 
Provost Cecil Lytle. 

"We decided that we would initiate the 
Lifetime Achievement Award for this occa-
sion, since we could not imagine a second 
person more important in the history and 
founding of this college," said Lytle, who 
praised Blanco-Aguinaga for his tenacity dur-
ing the Third College planning process. 

"It was not an easy ordeal, as Carlos would 
be the first to tell you," Lytle added. 

BIanco-Aguinaga said he was "very hon-
ored, very proud, very moved" to have re-
ceived the award, adding, "students, other 

people deserve it. It was a collecti ve effort. 
"I'm really dedicating thi s th ing to [the 

students who helped found ThirdJ," Blanco-
Aguinaga said. 

' 'Third College is probably the only col-
lege campus where its history is continually 
repeated," Blanco-Aguinaga added. " It must 
be remembered that those students are the 
ones who made the college." 

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Jo-
seph Watson, a chemistry professor and the 
advisor to the Black Student Caucus (BSe) 
when Third was founded, worked closely 
with Blanco-Aguinaga, who was an advisor 
for the Mexican American Youth Associ ation 
(MA Y A). The two worked with the students 
in planning the new college in 1969. 

"I think [Blanco-Aguinaga] is great ," 
Watson said. "He was there from the beg in-
ning, working with students and moving things 
forward." 

Blanco-Aguinaga and Watson were among 
those asked by then-Provost Armi n Rappaport 
to make suggestions about an ethnic studies 
program. 

Along with students from MA Y A and BSC 
and other faculty , Watson and Blanco-
Aguinaga formulated the "Lumumba-Zapata 
College Demands," a list of demands that

Student Leaders Fear that University Will Dissolve UCSA 
By Philip Mlc ...... 
News Editor 

An information packet for Uni-
versity of California chancellors 
put out by the Office of the Presi-
dent has created an uproar among 
student government leaders who 
claim that the university is attempt-
ing to dissolve the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA), the lobbying oraaniza-
tion for UC students. 

The packet, prepared for this 
Wednesday' 5 Chancellors' Meet-
ing, outlines options to make the 
university comply with the Cali-

fornia State Supreme Court's 
Smith v. Regents ruling. In Smith, 
the court ruled that maMatory stu-
dent fees cannot be allocated to 
organizations in which political, 
ideological or religious activities 
outweigh educational benefits. The 
court's decision was upheld by the 
U.S. Supreme Court earlier this 
month. 

The options which have caused 
the uproar involve the Office of 
the President's suggestions on how 
to fund the UCSA in light of the 
Smith ruling. The three options 
include dissolving the UCSA en-

tirely, reforming the UCSA as a 
Council of Pres idents (which ex-
isted from 1972 until the early 
19805) or prohibiting the UCSA 
from any lobbying activity. 

"[The options] would bas ically 
cripple the UCSA l'y preventing it 
from lobbying the Legislature and 
the government," said Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) Vice 
President External James Sze, who 
added that the Smith ruling does 
not prohibit students from lobby-
ing. "These options limit students 
from having a voice in the legis-
lature." 

A.S . Vice Pres idenl External 
Nic k Endres said that studen t gov-
ernment leaders had not been al-
lowed to see the packet. 

Susie Castillo-Robson of the 
Office of the Pres ide nt denied that

According to Edelman, pov-
erty in America "is one of the 
greatest human and moral trag-
edies." She added that children in 
the United States are more likely 
to be poor than their Western Eu-
ropean counterparts. 

" IOur] children are the poorest 
Americans in the richest nation on 
earth. What are the true values of 
a wealthy nation? How do we rec-
oncile rampant national child ne-
glect and suffering?" 

Edelman said that aside from 
poverty , the main causes of child-
hood suffering in America are vio-
lence and child abuse. An initial 

gion and values play vital roles in 
helping to shape the lives of chil-
dren. "We all need to reconcile the 
breakdown of values and stop the 
dichotomy between private and pub-
lic values," she said.

child prostitute, we've got to give 
children a future, give them a sense

American must personally and 
collectively struggle and work to-

Troupe, a member of the Helen Edison Advisory 
Committee which helped bring Walcott to the lecture 
series, spoke about his friendship with Walcott, which 
dates back to 1968. 

The first poem Walcott read on Thursday was 'T~e 
New World.' He also read a large excerpt from Omeros, 
his 64-chapter account ofthe mental journey of a black 
man from the Caribbean to Africa. 

Walcott, the first Nobel Prize-winner from the West 
Indies, has written 11 books and several plays. Aside 
from his literary work, Walcott is also painter. 

Walcott was born on the island of St. Lucia and 
lived for several years on the island of Trinidad. He is 
currently a professor at Boston University. 

Much of Walcott's works deal with the West Indies. 
Walcott, who is a mixture of African, Dutch and Ell-
glish, writes about the pull he feels from his African, 
Caribbean and European heritage. 

Red Ribbon Week Celebrated by 
California Highway Patrol 

In celebration of Red Ribbon Week, the California 
Highway Patrol will decorate its patrol cars with red 
ribbons to promote awareness about alcohol and drug 
abuse. Red Ribbon Week began on Saturday and runs 
through Oct. 31. 

' Every October, we set aside one week that we call 
Red Ribbon Week: said California Hig!1way Patrol 
Border Division Commander Clarence Tuck. ' It is a 
week we use to remind ourselves that alcohol and 
other drugs can be letha: when used in combination 
with roads and highways: 

Red Ribbon Week is a nationwide event designed 
to promote public awareness of the hazards associ· 
ated with drinking and driving. "People who have 
consumed alcohol have to take responsibility for their 
own well-being even if they aren 't behind the wheel,' 
Tuck said .

U CSA: Students 
criticize university's 
Smith proposals 
Continued from .,..e 1 
UCSA. The proposals in the infor-
mation packet are nothing more 
than possible policy decisions that 
the university may pursue. "One 
[option] would certainly be that 
the UCSA reconstitute itself. but 
we certainly do not seek to dis-
solve the UCSA," she added. 

Endres, however. was highly 
critical of the proposals. "The Of-
fice of the President has left no 
room in any of the options that 
they're presenting to the chancel-
lors," he said. 

UCSA Executi ve Director 
Andy Shaw said that the options . 
proposed by the Office of the 
President have little to do with 
the Smith ruling. "All that Smith 
deals with is how you fund politi-
cal activities including lobbying. 
It doesn't say you can't have 
them." said Shaw, who added that 
he felt the university was exploit-
ing the Sm;,11 ruling to get rid of 
the UCSA. 

UC President Jack PeJtason, on 
campus for the dedication of 
Marshall College, said that his of-
fice had not suggested anything. 
" What is being discussed is how to 
bring the policies and practices of 
the university in line with the state 
constitution," Peltason said, add-
ingthat it would be up to the chan-
cellors to define the policy. 

According to Endres, it is ru-
mored that the uproar over the 
proposals may force the chancel-
lors to postpone discussing the 
ueSA's future.

ber, you can do your 
pan to prevent even 
funher increases by 

voti ng hno" on Proposition 174. Proposition 
174 is the ill-conceived statewide referen-
dum which would give parents of school-
aged chi ldren a tax-funded voucher worth 
about $2,600 which they could spend at 
private or parochial schools. 

The proposition would affect fee hikes in 
the following way: the initiative would bank-
rupt the state, inevitably forcing it yet again 
to balance the budget on the backs of Uni-
versi ty of California students. Even its sup-
porters concede that the proposition would 
force the state to spend hundreds of millions 
of dollars that it doesn't have to subsidize 
students who are already in pri vate schools. 
The bottom line is that when the state is 
str.lpped for cash, the UC system is always 
among the first to feel the pain. 

The fiscal chaos that would be unleashed 
if Proposition 174 were passed has led even 

demic standards would be almost impo~­
sible to correct. Current law allows the state 
legislature and local governments to change 
laws and regulations of private schools by a 
simple majority vote of the relevant govern-
ment body. 

But Proposition 174 would change all 
that. It requires the passage?f any new or 
revised state law - such as one for 
teaching standard or fiscal account-
ability - to get a nearly-impossible 
three-fourths vote of the state leg-
islature in both houses. And local 
governments would be prevented 
from imposing new health, safety 
or land use regulations on pri-
vate schools unless they were 
able to get a two-thirds vote 
by the local governing body 
and approval in an election 
by a majority of all the 
registered voters (rather 
than simply a majority 
of those who actually 
vote) in the effected 
area. I n other 
words, the 
a u -

supporters of the voucher movement to _~",~' 
oppose this particular measure. Take .iJWI"." 
the comments of Gov. Pete Wil-
son. who said, "I cannot respon-
sibly advocate taking a risk 
that ... seriously could worsen the 
state's budget situation and jeopardize 
the funding for education." 

And Proposition 174 's fiscal irrespon-
oIi ibility is far from its only problem. The 
poorly-written initiative is full of loopholes 
and lacks any safeguards. 

First. the proposition does not require 
voucher schools to meet any standards of 
academic responsibility. AI most anyone en-
rolling 25 students cou Id qua I i fy as a voucher 
" chool." And there would be no meaning-
ful course requirements - under 174 and 
other existing laws, voucher schools would 
not even have to teach full courses in math, 
reading, science or history. Standardized 
tesl scores would not have to be published. 
Proposition L74 gives billions in tax dollars 
to private voucher schools, yet it requires no 
public audits of how that money is spent. 
There would be no safeguards against fraud 
and abuse - private schools would be al-
lowed to spend our tax dollars virtually 
without sc ruliny. 

Meanwhile. the authors of the initiative 
have gone out oflheir way to make sure that 
these lax or non-existent fiscal and aca-

thors 
of Propos i-

tion 174 have 
made sure to make it 

almost impossible for tax-
payers to attempt to get any say 

in the way our dollars will be spent. 
Proposition 174 would also jeopardize 

existing state funding to public schools. If 
passed, it would supersede some of Proposi-

. tion 98's minimum funding requirement 
for public schools by creating a new com-
plex formula for determining per-pupil 
spending. Ultimately, as the state legislative 
analyst points out, this formula would have 
the effect of reducing the minimum amount 
thatthe state is required to spend per pupil in 
the public schools. 

Other problems include the fact that 
voucher schools would not be required to 
meet the needs of disabled or disadvantaged 
students, and there would be no caps on or 
regulation of private school tuition. 

Then there is the issue of the separation

YET ANOTHER MAJOR STATE ISSUE will be left tip to the 
voters of California. This time, it is 'over education_ ((s

Californians love

years, state referen-
dums have set the pa-
rameters for our taxes, 
auto insurance cover-
age and liability and 

even a state lottery. Now the people of 
California are expected to determi ne the fate 
of their state's educational system through 
Proposition 174. Why leave policy deci-
sions to the expertise of insensitive, out-of-
touch technocrats of the state Legislature 
when you can leave such politically-charged 
issues to the state electorate? We didn' t elect 
our state representati ves in office to make 
significant deci sions aboutCalifornia's fu-
ture; they are only there to deadlock over 
budgets and legislate helmet laws. 

Organized by A Better Choice (ABC), 
Propostion 174 is California's school-
voucher initiative that would allocate $2,600 
in public funds for each child to spend on 
private schools. ABC realizes that such a 
proposal has no chance of passing through 
the state Legislature. To try to pass a pro-
posal like this one - one which would 
revolutionize a fundamental sector of our 
society - through a state Legislature is 
political suicide. Listen to a couple of Willy 
Brown stories, and one will quickly realize 
how much of a grip the assembly speaker 
has over the agenda. So they made school 
vouchers into a referendum to be voted on 

November's ballot. Why not skip the middle-
man and head stmight for the client? 

Proponents of the voucher movement 
realize what type of obstacle'S they face in 
the California Legislature which is domi-
nated by the interests of teachers' unions 
and associations. Proposition 174 is meant 
to shake up our educational system - it 
essentially injects free-market mechanisms 
into a deteriorating sector of our society 
currently monopolized by a stagnant, 
overbloated bureaucracy.

COMMENTARY: Propostion 174 gives parents the ultimate choice for their children's education. It will especially help those who live in 
poor neighborlloods and are deprived of adequate resources for childhood development. 

A BETIEB CHOICE FOR INNER-CI'I'¥ EDUCATION 
By MMo Lopez 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

That public schools in California 
have gotten progressively worse 
over the last 20 years is no secret. 
Every election promises to increase 
the amount of funding for public 
schools, yet the quality of education 
has continued to spiral downward. 

Fortunately, Californians have 
the chance to step away from a sys-
tem that has repeatedly failed them 
and adopt one which offers better 
hope. 

Proposition 174 would give par-
ents the choice to send their children 
to any private school they want, by 
way of a $2,600 voucher. For kids 
trapped in the hell of deteriorating 
public schools, especially in the in-
ner cities, Proposition 174 is the 
escape hatch - a door that, given 
the crumbling state of public schools 
in California, parents must open if 
they wish to see their children edu-
cated. 

Take the typical case of IO-year-
old Alberto and the situation in 
which he and his family are in living 
in San Diego. A lberto is a fifth grader 
at a local elementary school. He has 
been recognized by his teachers as a 
bright, cheerful kid and he tries to 
dowell in school. Next year, Alberto 
is supposed to attend Wilson Middle 
School. Transition to middle schooV 
junior high is always a tricky thing 
for students and parents, but the 
problem with Alberto's situation 

goes beyond the normal concerns. 
Wilson Middle School is a bad place 
to learn, a bad place to be for a kid 
like Alberto. 

How bad is it? When Alberto's 
older brother went there some nine 
years ago, he saw a classmate do 
cocaine in class. Everyday before 
gym class, kids would smoke mari-
juana outside the racketball courts. 
Students carried weapons to school: 
knives, chains, nunchukus and meat 
cleavers were typical parapherna-
lia. Massive fights after school in-
volving two dozen or more kids 
were not uncommon. 

All indications are Ihal things 
have not gOllen any better. The 
neighborhood has gvllen a Iqt 
meaner in recent years along with 
the school. Teachers' assistants tell 
of kids who attend classes on drugs 
and hang out after school to drink 
malt liquor. 

Naturally, Alberto's family is a 
bit worried. They have a good kid 
who is about to be placed into a 
horrible environment. Do they have 
achoice? Presently, no. The district 
rules are that if you live within a 
certain distance of a school, you 
must attend a school within that 
district. When the other schools in 
the district are only lTWJinally bet-
ter, as far as the district bureaucracy 
is concerned, that's just too bad. 
Welcome to the jungle. 

A private school would be a good 
option, especially since there is a 

decent one less than two blocks from 
Albeno's home. But there is always 
that tricky little thing known as 
money, and when you don't have 
enoughofit, attending private school 
is no option at all. 

Alberto is not alone. Everywhere 
there are good kids like hi m who are 
trapped in schools that just fail to 
educate. For years, the politicians 
and teachers unions such as the Na-
tional Education Association have 
told us the same thing: give more 
money to the public schools. This is 
a typical liberal solution to every 
problem - throw money at it. 

I've got news for them. It doesn't 
work. In California, we've raised 
taxes, we've instituted a lottery, 
we've passed bond measures. The 
people have accepted what they 've 
been told to throw money and over 
and over again the schools have 
failed. 

Many schools in the public school 
system have reached the end of the 
road. They just can't educate our 
children anymore, plain and simple. 
Again, Alberto has the testimony of 
his older brother to be cause for 
alarm. The teachers, concerned with 

their own survival until summer 
break and getting their kids out of 
class, have no desire to teach well. 

Every year that Alberto 's 
brother's attended school. all the 
secretaries received new comput-
ers. Every spring, the school was 
under budget. That's right, under 
budget. Solution? Quick, everyone 
figure out what you want or need so 
that all of the budget money will be 
used up. That way, we can argue for 
budget increases next year. 

Proposition 174 is not a miracle 
cure. Nothing is. But Proposition 
174 is a potential nightmare for the 
monopolistic National Education 
Association. 

It strips these people of much of 
their power, money and influence 
with one broad stroke of the pen and 
puts it where it should be - in the 
hands of students and in the hands of 
parents. 

Proposition 174 injects elements 
into the public schools that can do 
much more than money can to help 
education. It gives binh to a system 
in which parents, teachers and ad-

miniStrat~rs share responsibility. It 
makes ~ools accountable to stu-
dents and parents and it gives schools 
incentives to do well. 

The arguments against 174 are 
based on fear, intimidation and lies 
concocted by the NEA andil, co-
horts to save their own tai Is and 
keep the children trapped in their 
miserable system. That is why they 

have spent more than $20 million in 
negati ve adveni sing. 

They argue that 174 creates a 
"two-tiered system of education -
one for the ha ve and one ror the 
have-nots." This description is comi-
cally ironic, si nce it perfectly de-
scribes California" present system, 
which boils down {O this: if you 
have money, you can leave n public 
school for one that work,: if you 
don ' t (like Alberto's parents) then 
thank you for playing our game but 
you come out a loser. 

The tiscal i .,.pact of Propo~ition 
174 is not clear, de. pite the lies of 
the education estublishmenLlt could 
create anywhere from costs in the 
$800 million range to savings of 
about $1 million. depending on how 
many students choose to leave the 
schools they are at now. Also con-
trary to opponents' contention ,sav-
ings would not hun public schools 
unless the Legislature chose not to 
invest the money back into them, in 
which case the problem I ies wi th the 
Legislature, not with 174. 

11 is also irresponsible and fa lla-
cious to describe 174 as a public 
versus pri vate school measure. TIlere 
are some good public schools left . 
Many of the schools in the North 
County have done quite well, and it 
shows in the performance of their 
students. 

Proposition 174 is not about pub-
. c versus private, it i about good

SMITH RULING IJEAVES FEw OPTIONS 
Editor: 

Although the recent Smith v. Re-
gents ruling has dealt a huge blow to 
the sharing of ideas on campus by 
mandating that students cannot be 
forced to associate with "political 
and ideological" organizations, it 
need not destroy the ability of stu-
dent government to facilitate the 
sharing of political ideas or to de-
fend students' interests in Sacra-
mento through its allocation of slu-
dent fees. 

Student governments and the 
University of California Students 
Association (UCSA) have proposed 
a sensible and legal approach to 
complying with Smith, which if 
implemented will protect student 
organizations from huge funding 
losses while protectin~ dissenters 
from forced association, Under this 
proposal student governments would 
allow students who object to re-
ceive a refund for student organiza-
tions they consider controversial 
before the money is spent. This sys-
tem is used by the statewide student 
lobby in Wisconsin and has proven 
effecti ve in allowi ng objectors a 
chance to opt out without destroy-
ing the funding base for the Student 
Lobby. 

The uni versity administration has 
rejected the student proposal and 
has forced student governments to 
decide between two unsatisfactory 
choices for implementing the deci-
sion, both of which go far beyond 
the mandate of the court. 

Under option A, all studentorga-
nizations could only receive fund-
ing through a positive donation on 
students' bills. This type of funding 
mechanism is costly to administer 
and proven in the past to be com-
pletely ineffeClive at generati ng rev-
enue. 

Option B, on the other hand, 
would force student government to 
define which type of organizations 
are political and ideological and 
subject them to a positive check-off . 
This option would force the A.S. to 
censor the speech of student organi-
zations, 

Student organizations would ei-
ther have to conform their acti vities 
to fall under the student 
government's definition of non-
ideological or risk losing their fund-
ing. In addition, even if student gov-
ernments were able to reach a work-

the large majority of state's 3,839 
schools are church-affiliated -

There are problems wilh private

existing private schools can only

students.The state legislative ana-
lyst estimates that in order for the 
state to break even in the long-run, 
more than I million pyblic school 
students would have to transfer to 
voucher-redeeming schools. In this 
unlikely scenario, the state could 
not afford to pay for students who 
have already switched to private 
schools. But even private school 
officials doubt that enough schools

Stephen.' MotIv •• 
Ar. Highly Suspect 
Editor: 

The students at UCSD "deserve 
to know" the truth of any accusa-
tions made by Jim Stephens against 
their co-ops. This is a story of a 
devious. self-concerned and destruc-
tive individual who has nothing bet-
ter to do with his time, having cho-
sen to be jobless and homeless, than 
attempt to destroy a unique organi-
zation established for the benefit of 
UCSD students, the CM Caf~. 

When Jim Stephens came to the 

will magically spring up to make up 
the difference. In this regard, it is 
important to point out Ihat when 
proponents of Proposition 174 claim 
that millions of dollars wil1 actually 
be saved in the long run, Ihey are 
assuming that even more students 
- 30 percent or more - will swi tch 
to these phantom private schools 
that do not currently exist. 

Meanwhile, in order to balance 
the budget, the state would be forced 
to make up for these huge shortfalls 
through deeper budget cuts - such 
as to the UC system - and higher 
taxes. Proposition 174 would be a 
drastic and dangerous plunge into 
uncertainty and fiscal chaos. Noth-
ing like it has ever been tried any-
where in the nation - not even on 
just a city-wide scale. Yet its au-
thors have gone out of their way to 
make sure that the proposition would 
be extremely difficult to amend and 
correct once implemented. 

No one disputes the fact that our 
public schools need to be reformed, 
But it is clear that the ill-conceived 
Proposition 174 is not the answer. 
The measure is literally a risk we 
cannot afford to take. 

Che Cafe with his idea for an orga-
nization that would feed the home-
les , the members of the collective 
first suggested that he donate his 
effons and energy to an organiza-
tion already providing that se rvice, 
Food Not Bombs. However, Mr. 
Stephens wanted to start hi s own 
organization. Thecollecti ve was ini-
tially willing to assist his effons 
with letters of supporl and use of the 
Che refrigerator, but Mr. Stephens 
did not feel Ihis was enough and 
proceeded to anempt to cOllvi nce 
members of the collecti ve that he 
should have unconditional access to 

theCh~space. although he no longer 
was willing to work wi th the organi-
zation. He also proposed that the 
Che Cafe not meet the responsibili-
ties required of them under the 
newly-signed Memorandum of Un-
derstanding (MOU) wilh UCSD, al-
low Ihe Che to go under and then set 
up his own organization , Food for 
Thought, in the facility . 

This last piece of information 
seems to contlict with whal Mr. 
Stephens has purported as hi s mo-
tiveforattackingtheOver ightCom-
mittee and the A.S. President. Carla 
Tesak, for ignoring his "ev idence of 
numerous material violations of the 
MOU by the Ch~ Cafe this past 
summer." He seems to be saying, in 
his letter, that his main interest is 
simply that the MOU is not "DOA." 
But a few months before he was 
attempting to keep the Che from 
upholding the MOU. 

The truth of the matteristhatlim 
Stephens is simply upset thaI the 
Che Cafe and the Oversight Com-
mittee have refused to tum over a 
student-run space to an outsider for 
no apparent reason. A simple re-
quest for proof of a material viola-
tion of the MOU would seem rea-
'Sonable, don't you think? 

The Oversight Committee is a 
joint A.S. and GSA c()rnlllitt~e that 
are formt!d ill the MOU. the sole 
purpose of which is to ensure [hal all 
panies to the MOU are living up to 
their responsibilitie .. It would not 
be in the best interests of this com-
mittee to look Ihe other way or ig-
nore material violationsofthe MOU 
by any co-op or other party to the 
agreement.

Wilson Draws Fire for Cal Grant Veto 
STATE: Bill would have 
shifted funds to most 
needy students 
By Jonna Pal..., 
Associate News Editor 

University of California stu-
dent leaders expressed theirdisap-
pointment with Gov. Pete Wilson 
for his veto of Assembly Bill 2227, 
which would have shifted funds in 
Cal Grant Awards to the most fi-
nancially-needy students. 

The bill. which was returned 
without Wilson's signature on Oct. 
8. would have switched the ratio 
offunds allocated to the Cal Grant 
A and Cal Grant B programs. The . 
Cal Grant A program currently 
receives 60 percent of the total 
funds available to the Cal Grant 
Program. Assembly Bill 2227 
would have given Cal Grant A 
awards 40 percent and Cal Grant 
B allocations 60 percent of the Cal 
Grant funds. 

In a statement to the members 
of the California Assembly, Wil-
son said, "This bill would revise 
the Cal Granl student aid program 
by decreasing the number of 
awards based primarily on merit 
(Cal Grant A) and increasing the 
number of awards based primarily· 
on need (Cal Grant B)." 

Wilson added that he wanted to 
keep the Cal Grant funding alloca-
tion ratio the same. "Since we have 
limited resources. it makes good 
sense to provide the aid to the 
sludent with the higher GPA -

and what the college stands for. 
"To me, there is a sense of congru-
ence to Thurgood Marshall's 
legacy and what we as students, 
faculty and staff are trying to ac-
complish," Hill said. 

One Of the happiest people at 
the ceremony was former Chan-
cellor William McGill, who served 
when Third College was founded. 

McGill had been vocal in his 
opposition 10 naming the college 
Lumumba-Zapata College, after 
Partice Lumumba, prime minister 
oflhe Congo. and Em i I iano Zapata, 
an early 20th-Century revolution-
ary leader in Mexico. 

not only as a reward for superior 
academic achievement, but be-
cause there is a strong correlation 
between high school achievement 
and completion of college," Wil-
son said. 

Due to a lack of funding, only 
one outoffive students who apply 
for a Cal Grant are given an award. 
Proponents of the bill said that 
they advocated the change because 
it would increase the number of 
grants given tp the most needy 
applicants. 

"It's almost a linear relation-
ship," said Associated Students 
Vice President External Nick 
Endres. "A lot of students with a 
high GPA are also [students) that 
have higher incomes." Endres also 
said that the veto would "have a 
big impact [on] sludents and their 
ability to get financial aid." 

University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) Execu-
tive Director Andy Shaw ex-
pressed his disappointment with 
the veto as well. "nt was a] bill 
that promoted access by shifting 
the distribution to the most needy 
people," Shaw said. 

One of the reasons the gover-
nor cited for refusing to sign the 
bill was that he wanted to continue 
to focus on incentives for achiev-
ing higher GPAs. " ... AB 2227 
would send a signal to students 
and their parents that high achieve-
ment was no longer valued. Rec-
ognizing ' merit' is not an anach-
ronism," Wilson said. 

According to Endres, however, 

students have already proven 
themselves worthy of financial aid 
simply by being accepted at the 
California State University or the 
University of California. 

The bill would also have allo-
cated 10 percent of all Cal Grant B 
funds to students who did not have 
a GPA to report or whose GPA 
was below a 2.0, which was an-
other reason for Wilson's veto. 
"What kind of message does a 
provision like this send to high 
school studenls about working to 
achieve high grades? While ( can 
appreciate the need to have a small 
amount of freedom to deal with 
exceplional cases, this is an unac-
ceptably high level," Wilson said. 

In a statement issued by the 
office of Assemblyman Mike 
Gotch (D-761h Districl), opponents 
of Wilson's veto said, "Cal Gran! 
B applicants who' do not report a 
grade-poi nt average are often 
older, re-entry students for whom 
a high school GPA is no longer 
relevant. The Student Aid Com-
mission assigns these students a 
2.0 GPA for purposes of the Cal 
Grant B selection formula," the 
statement said. 

"We're very disappointed ... 
that the governor has shown bla-
tant lack of respect for students 
who need this financial aid," 
Endres said. 

Although the bill did not pass 
this year, Shaw said ttlat he antici-
pates the introduction of a similar 
bill someti me afterthe Legislature 
reconvenes in January. 

McGill said that he was pleased 
with Third College's new name. 
"Can y'ou know what it means to 
meT' he asked. "If you had asked 
me if this day would ever come, I 
wouldn't have guessed." 

In the high point of the cer-
emony, Children's Defense Fund 
President Marian Wright Edelman 
praised the memory of Marshall 
and called on the audience to con-
tinue his legacy. "No one in 
America has done more to have us 
live up 10 our ideals." Edelman 
said. 

M ..... II Col .... Provost Cecil Lyti. Hid that Third CoIle,e has 
. always .mbodled the Ide ... chllmplonecl by Thurgood Marshall. 

"In this post-Cold War era, on 
the eve of a new century and a new 
millenniurn ... youandlrnuSlcause 
chanJC just like Justice Marshall 
[did] and not just witness it,." s!Je, 

added. 
Edelman's speech was fre-

quently interrupted by applause 
and concluded with a standing 
oval ion from the audience. 

Afterwards, Lytle thanked 
Edelman for her speech. which he 
called "0 reminder of why we got 
in this business in lhe first place." 

Friday's ceremony «apped a 
23-year-long odyssey that began 
when Third College o~~ed its 

doors in 1970. The college, which 
was founded to emphasize diver-
sity, ethnicity and social justice. 
had considered many nllmes in-
cluding Clio College, Lumumba-
Zapata College and Mani n Luther 
King College. 

"Marshall College" was first 
proposed last February and ap-
proved by campus administrators. 
The Board of Regents agreed to 
the name change in May.

Building a 
Better Student 

VOWNTEERI: UCSD stmJents who participate in the Prutners At Learning 
project bring elementary school kids from the playground to the lecture hall 
By MIc ...... Monahan 
Staff Writer 

I T WAS A REWARDING MOMENT for Revelle College junior Damian Coleman when he brought one of his students 
to visit the UCSD campus earlier 
this year. It was one of those mo-
ments that made his involvement 
in the Partners At Learning (PAL) 
program an amazing experience. 

"( brought one of my kids 
around campus, and he had a great 
time. He said, 'I'm going to a 
university just like this one.' Just 
by walking around with me, now 
he knows he wants to go to col-
lege," Coleman said. ~ 

"And once you know where 
you want to go, you have a chance 
to get there." 

Coleman is just one of approxi-
mately 90 UCSD students partici-
pating in PAL, a program which 
was formed in an effort to encour-
age public service by using uni-
versity resources. 

As part of the Teachers Educa-
tion Program (TEP) offered in 
conjunction with Thurgood 
Marshall College's public service 
program, PAL panicipants bec6me 
mentors for one or two elementary 
school children and spend four to 
'six hours a week tutoring and get-
ting to know them. 

Created three years ago, PAL 
was developed to tap into student 
volunteerism, according to 
Marshall College Provost Cecil 
Lytle. "'The university was lag-
ging in recognizing that [volun-
teer programs are] something that 
students were interested in," he 
said. 

"[PAL is) more than just a 
university project, it's a commu-
nity project. We have come to-
gether to do something very spe-
cial forourstudents," Lytle added. 
A l.8.-nInc E~ 

PAL Program Director Rafael 
Hernandez said that aside from 
serving the San Diego commu-
nity, the PAL program broadens 
the horizons of its participants. 

GUARDIAN 

FEH11IHE5 
"The university students are ex-
posed to experiences that are not 
available [on campus) . They're 
also developing social responsi-
bilities, dealing with the issues in 
the community and trying to make 
a difference," Hernandez said. 

According to Hernandez, cre-
ating a leamingex~rience for both 
the elementary and college stu-
dents involved is the motivation 
behind PAL. 

"The idea behind the title is 
that it's a two·way street," 
Hernandez said. "It's not just the 
university mentors going to- the 
schools and providing services to 
the children. It's the university 
mentors learning some things from 
the; kids as well." 
Pr .... forPAL 

TEP Assistant Director Randall 
Souviney explained that PAL was 
first established solely as a volun-
teer program for students who did 
not necessarily have a particular 
interest in teaching. "But we are 
finding over time that a number of 
these students are becoming at-
tracted to teaching as a career," 
Sou viney said. 

Panicipants on both sides of 
the program praised PAL for its 
contributions. PAL Assistant Di-
rector Shelley Ruelas, a Muir Col-
lege alumnus, emphasized the val-
ues of her experiences as a PAL 
mentor. 

"It helped me to reaffirm my 
belief in what I wanted to do and 
realize that I wanted to continue 
working in the education system 
because so often you hear so many 
of the negatives that are goi ng on: 
not enough money in the school , 
budgets are being cut every-
where .... But when you ' re there 
and you're working with the kids ... 
it just empowers you to go on," 
Ruelas said. 

The children involved in the 
program are chosen on the basis of 
their needs, determ ined byihe fac-
ulty and administration of the nine 
schools that participate in PAL. 
Students •• Role Model. 

According to Hernandez. the 
program benefits the chi ldren by 
demystifying higher education. 

"You do that by having these 
fole models that kids can talk to. 
Some of these kids have never 
even been on a college campus," 
he said. 

The PAL program hopes to get 
parents more involved in their 
children's education as well. "It's 
the best thing that any school could 
ever do," said Doris Johnson, 
whose child participates in PAL. 
"My d41ughter is ge«ing the chance 
to see the other side because I 
never went to college." 

Johnson volunteers for the Par-
ent Institute for Quality Educa-
tion, a six-week course offered for 
parents of school·age children 
which moves from school tu ,chool 
sharing information about the con-
cerns of children. Through this 
course, she has spread the word 
about the posit i ve effects of PAL. 
Johnson added that she hopes the 
program will be implemented in 
more schools. 
l'IIe M ........ Philosophy 

PAL stems from the Marshall 
College philosophy which calls 
for college students to become in-
vol ved in community service. The 
Marshall College curriculum has 
urged students to experience the 
world that is "offthehill.·· as Lytle 
puts it, referring to thi ~ campus' 
isolated existence on the cliffs of 
La Jolla. 

" I hope Ihat college means more 
than a bunch of cour. es. I hope it 
means a bunch of experiences:' 
Lytle ~a id. 

"Wh~lt we' re trying to accol11-
plish here i, (hat all orlhc,e i"ues 
are interrelated. the study uf math. 
the study of citizenship, the study 
of social sciences, regardless of 
what major you are,"

VOUCHERS: 
Voucher movement

ContInued from pap 4 
realize that, as is the case with health 
care, they are getting very little in 
comparison to what they are con-
tributing to the system. The 
movement's strongest asset is em-
powennent - allowing parents to 
determine the course of their 
children's education. Empowering 
the parents would also deflate the 
influence of the bureaucracy. It is 
every free-marleeter's wet dream to 
make deficient bureaucracies 
acccountable for their own inepti-
tude. 

Theoretically. the voucher pro-
gram would also save California 
billions of dollars, since the state 
already pays an estimated $4,569 
for each student to attend public 
school. Public schools would be 
forced to compete against the qual-
ity of education private schools 
would provide, compelling public 
schools to innovate their techniques 
and improve budget management.

vate schools would face minimal 
constraints and restrictions on their 
day-to-day operations. while public

gender aDd physical handicaps (other 
fonns of discrimination result in dis-
qualification of voucherpri vi leges). 
However, the learning capacities of 
students are nol equal. Many have 
special needs that the public schools 
are not equipped to handle, 

The answer to our educational 
crisis lies in school vouchers but not 
in the way they are presented in 
Proposition 174. For one, religious 
and parochial schools wouldqualify 
for voucher redemption, which ex-
plains why many fundamental reli-
gious groups back the initiative. 

As Howard Ahmanson, a fre-
Quent contributor to Christian 
causes, put it, "My purpose is total 
integration of Biblical law into our 
lives." Scary.

discovered that private schools in 
California only have 43,000 empty 
spaces - enough to accommodate 
only one percent of poblic school 
students. Considering that Califor-
nia public schools educate over 90

buildings will have to do more than

Artists that listen. 

An improved version of the pro-
posal would restrict school vouch-
ers to secular private schools and 
use the savings to subsidize and 
encourage the opening of new ones. 
The state can implement an educa-
tional policy of tax breaks and in-
come subsidies to meet these goals. 

For now, Proposition 174 is too 
hazy for our present purposes, al -
though school vouchers are a viable 
solutions. 

Proposition 174 is not the exact 
answer to our problems. but it does 
present a viable alternative in un-
derstanding our educational fu-
ture. It is a risk wecan afford to take.

play by stressing 
the importance 
of peaki ng atlhe 
end of the year. 

As in seasons 
past, the Tritons have found their 
winning touch at the perfect time. 

Last weekend, UCSD finished 
4-0 at the Trinity University Invita-
tional in San Antonio, without drop-
ping a single game. The four victo-
ries for the second-runked Tritons 
(17-9) improved their recent win 

streak to seven straight. 
In its first match on Friday, the 

Tritons used a mostly-freshman 
lineup to overwhelm Elmhu~t Col-
lege (IL) in a three-game sweep, 15-
7,15-11,15-9. 

St. Thomas College (MN) posed 
the next threat for the Tritons. Game 
one alone lasted more than 55 min-
utes but UCSD finally broke through 
to take the set, 16-14. 

Behind the powerful hitting of 
Elizabeth Vesanovic (18 kills), 
Laura Kranz (12 kills) and Jennifer 
Cross (10 kills), UCSD cruised to 
another sweep with back-to-back 
15-6 triumphs. 

On Saturday, the Tritons faced 

overmatched Southwestern Uni ver-
sity (TX). 

Again, Dannevik uti lized Ihe end 
of his bench, giving his younger 
players some valuable experience. 
The results were thesnme-a 15-8, 
15-3, 15-4 thrashing. 

"[The Southwestern match] gave 
us a chance to develop all of our 
players. We'd much rather gi ve some 
of our younger players some play-
ing time instead of just killing 
people," Dannevik said. 

The final challenge for Ihe Tri-
tons came from host Trinity Univer-

Vesanovic again topped Ihe li st 

of Triton hitters, killing 13 balls and 
digging nine. Cross crushed eight 
kills and had three solo blocks. 
Kranz. Julie Harvey and Kristi 
Askeland crushed eight kill s each. 

With se~en wins in a row and 
less than a month until Regionals. 
Dannevik likes how his team is 
developing. "We're playing as well 
as we should be at this point in the 
season. We're in a groove." 

Vesanovic and Cross were both 
named to Ihe All-Tournament leam. 
Both amassed impressive kill and 
dig numbers and played vi rtually 
error-free. 

The Tritons preferred to utili ze a 
ne w offense this wl'dend. " It 's 
slow-moving, wi th gLly~ rUllning set 
cuts to gel open," aplained d ub 
member David Carra. 

Unfortunately. the inexperienced 
Tri tonscould not afford thl? unforced 
errors that wl!re t.he banI! of the of-
fense on Saturday. 

"The~e guy~ I tht: oppo,itionJ

Kuppennan. "Th i~ i\ jUM the pre-

UCSD Dethrones Kingsmen 
MEN'S SOCCER: Despite injury to key starters, Ripley converts two goals and 
a stingy Triton defense manages to blank arch-rival Cal Lutheran. 2-0, 
By Ken Perlman 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
and Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
can rest a lillie easier now - the 

worst is be-
hind them. 

The Tri-
tons( 12-2-1) 
just finished 
a rugged 
four-game 
tretch and 

emerged un-
scathed with 
a 2-0 win 
over the 
Kingsmenof 
Cal Lutheran 

yesterday in Thousand Oaks. 
The win, UCSD's sixth straight, 

was the last hurdle in a tough series 
that Armstrong has been touting all 
year as the final step before the 
NCAA Division III playoffs. 

ond-Ieading scorer, sophomore Joel 
Kosakoff, who had suffered a bro-
ken bone in his left foot in the game 
against The Masters College on Oct. 
13. In addition, midfielder Matt 
Chilton was slowed by a broken 
nose from a collision in .the Grand 
Canyon game. 

The Tritons established the tempo 
early. Senior Robert Ripley put them 
on the boards barely two minutes 
into the contest. 

Ripley took a pa. s from Chris 
Romey and moved deep into 
Kingsmen territory. The forward 
outmaneuvered aCLU defender and 
knocked in a shot from the bottom 
right-hand comerofthe penalty box 
to break the scoreless tie and put the 
Tritons up 1-0. 

Despite a barrage of shots, Cal 
Lutheran couldn't get on the board. 
The Kingsmen got off 12 attempts 
in the first half, but were thwarted at 
every tum by UCSD goalie Michael 
Madden. 

enough against oneofDivi ion II/'s 
top opponents. 

"[Cal Lu] is one of the top-20 
teams in Division Ill. They are al-
ways tough," przybylek said. 

Ten minutes into the second 
period, Ripley again beat his de-
fender and found himself one-on-
one with Kingsmen goalkeeper Josh 
Green. Ripley moved in and popped 
a shot past Green into the left-hand 
side of the goal to secure the victory. 

UCSD's win was even more 
spectacu lar considering that the Tri-
tons' leading scorer and main offen-
sive threat, Romey, was blanked in 
the game. 

Romey leads all Tritons with 14 
goals this seaSon, but he couldn't 
convert a goal in three attempts. 

In what has become cu tomary 
this season, UCSO's defense re-
mained stingy. Madden, Ken Burns, 
Nick Terlecky, Chris Fang, Brian 
Turner and the rest of the Tritons 
blanketed everyone of Cal 
Lutheran's 18 shots. 

Monday, Octobcl' 25, 1993 

Despite an easy win last week-
end against Grand Canyon Univer-
sity, UCSD found itselfwalking into 
CLU a battered and broken team. 

The Tritons were without se\:-

"Madden did a tremendous job 
in goal," Assistant Coach Ted 
Przybylek said. 

Still, a one goal lead is never 

"This is definitely a big win 
against a tough team," Przybylek 
said. " It was a great result." 

Eric Waldman (4) recorded three of the Tritons' 15 shots-on-goal 
and helped shut out the highly-touted Cal Lutheran Klngsmen.

It was enough to get by, and for 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
that was the most important factor 

in Friday's 
I-Owinover 
visiting Cal 
Baptist. 

While it 
was not the 
kind of final 
score the 
Tritons were 
hoping for. 
the victory 
kept UCSO 
undefeated 
on the sea-

son, raisi ng the team's record to li-
~-I. 

The Tritons dominated the game 
from the start, pinning the Lancer 
defense back while keeping the pres-
sure on Cal Baptist goalkeeper 

Cheyenna Bonter. 
Bonter is the latest in a string of 

athletic keepers the Tritons have 
faced in the last three games, and 
was the primary reason UCSDdidn't 
put the game away early in the first 
half. 

Just five minutes into the game, 
Bonter made the first of many im-
pressive saves when Triton Ele 
Johnson stole the ball from Cal 
Baptist's Mieke Verhagen 30 yards 
from the goal. Johnson turned on 
the afterbumers and had a one-on-
one with Bonter, who rushed 
Johnson and made a nice diving 
stop before Johnson could avoid her. 

The Tritons fi nally broke through 
almost 74 minutes into the game 
when Michelle Carbone took a shot 
that bounced off a defender and into 
the net for the only score UCSD 
would need. 

It was one of 12 shots the Tritons 
launched on the day, while the mea-

man Darryl Strawberry and 
rotator-cuftless homerhead 

Tritons Decimate 
Claremont Foes 

Jo e Canseco get paid a 
kajillion dollars to be perma-
nent starters on the injured-
reserve list. it is a refreshing 
sight to see omeone like 1993 
World Series MVP Paul 
Molitor get hi s just dues. 

WATER POLO: UCSD swept their matches against 
UC Riverside, Redlands and Air Force to capture 
Claremont University Invitational championship 

Now, I have never been a 
Toronto Blue Jays fan, and any 
American who would dare root 
against the hard-luck Philadel-
phia squad probably also 
screamed WiTh ec~tasy when 
Old Yeller died or else was a 
die-hard Kansas City Royals 
fan in 1980. (Thank you very 
lillie, you good-for-nothing, 
no-nrmed. one-senson-
wonderless, Tug McGrnw). 

Nevertheless, every time 
Molitor stepped to the plate, I 
couldn't help but cheer him on. 

lt's not like he needed my 
help in any way. Nothing short 
of a bullet to the bnck of the 
hcnd could have prevented 
Molitor from leading the Jays 
to the world title. 

Molitor had spent 16 
eternally long years producing 
Hall-of-Fame numbers for the 
stilltitleless Milwnukee 
Brewers - a team whose 
pitching staff was nbout as 
effective as a Mitch Williams 
fastball - before he signed as 
a free agent with Toronto at the 
stnrt of the 1993 season. 

By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Coach Denny Harper and his 
Triton men's water polo unit were 
far more concerned with the always 

demanding 
L.A. traffi c 
than with any-
thing their 
meager 
C la remont 
College Invita-
tional oppo-
nent s could 
manage to 
throw at the 
nation 's 10th-
ranked power. 

Las t 
weeke nd 's 

northerly stint offered lillie in the 
way of trying competition for the 
Tritons, who were not rested at all 
coming into the tournament. 

"We played right through this 
week, so the guys were probably 
pretty tired," Harper said. 

Nevertheless, Saturday's 22-3 
shelling of UC Ri verside truly ex-
hibited UCSD's eternal dominance 
over the hapless Highlanders. 

"We had so many people score, I 

couldn ' t even begin to tell you who 
scored what," Harper said. "Every-
one got into the act." 

The win advanced the Tritons to 
a second-round matchup against the 
unfortunate University of Redlands, 
and the game was as ugly as the 
Redlands' Bulldog mascot. The Tri-
tons neutered the overwhelmed ca-
nines, 16-6. 

"I think Redlands came into the 
game fired up. We did have to keep 
working," Harperadmitted. "But we 
pretty much had our way in that 
game." 

Air Force represented the only 
obstacle around which UCSD would 
have to maneuver to take the Invita-
tional title, but Sunday's marquee 
matchup turned into a B-52 carpet-
bombing extravaganza. The Tritons 
nuked the Falconsl4-6 to capture 
the championship. 

In a "carbon copy" of the previ-
ous Nonhem California game, in 
which UCSD triumphed 14-9, San 
Diego jumped all over Air Force 
early on, leading 7-0 early in the 
second period and 8-2 at halftime. 

But something strange happened 
on the way to the decimation. Se-

It's crunch time for the UCSD 
cross-country runners, and they 
know it. The Tritons have been rac-

ing without 
several top 
runners be-
cause of in-
jury, illness 
and other 
per so nal 

. matters, so 
Saturday'S 
meet at Cal 
Pol y 
Pomona was 
vital in 
bringing the 

team together for the stretch run. 
The Triton women came away 

with several impressive perfor-
mances, not the least of which was

Karen Hinkle' s pace-setting, per-
sonal-record time of 18:44 in the 
five-kilometer event, good for 
fourth-place in the division. 

"She has really grown up this 
year in her racing tactics," Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. 

Behind Hinkle was Janet Hanna, 
who came in 23rd with a time of 
20:23. Robyn Herskowitz was 39th 
(2 1 :39). Neither Hinkle, Hanna nor 
Herskowitz had raced the previous 
week at the Balboa Cla"ssic, so their 
performance was significant to 
preparation for next week's CCAA 
Championships. 

Rounding out the women's team 
were Danielle Eigner (21 :41) and 
Helen L' Annunzata (22:28). Eigner 
run what Van Arsdale called "the 
best race of her life." 

In the overall divisional stand-
ings, the women came in sixth place 

with 154 points. 
The men also featured some 

record-setting performances, fini sh-
ing third overall with 68 points. 

1.1. Castner and orian Leek both 
returned from illness to produce 
sparkling results. Both running at 
what Van Arsdale estimated as "90-
95 percent," Castner and Leek 
grabbed top-10 fini shes in the eight-
kilometer event. Castner ti nished 
second (25:02), while Leek was 
ninth (26:33). 

Leek' s performance is key to the 
Tritons' success if they want to re-
turn to the Nationals, and Van 
Arsdale felt good about his progress. 

"Brian is a really emotional run-
ner out there on the course. It usu-
ally takes him two weeks to put it all 
together, so he should be ready," he 
said. 

Behind Leek was Rhodes 

Walton, who fini shed 13th (26:50). 
Perhaps the best results were the 

tive personal records set by the men, 
including Dav id Rosen (28: 18), 
MikeRiley(28:2 Ij, Mike Engkhalt 
(29:07) and tirst-year runners Greg 
Kogut (27:34) and Cory Lohman 
(28: II ). 

With his attention shifting to-
ward the upcoming conference 
championships thi s Satu rday, Van 
Ar. dale discussed the team's major 
necessities . 

Conceding that Cal Poly SLO 
should be the easy winner. Van 
Arsdale concluded that Cal Poly 
Pomona would prove to be UCSD's 
toughest competitor for both the men 
and the women. 

"Judging by last weekend's 
scores, Pomona kicked our butts, 
but it isn't goi ng to be that \\':1)' next 
week," Van Ar~dale :.aid. 

GUARDIAN ATHLETE-OF-THE-WEEK 

In only his sophomore season , J.J. Castner 
has emerged a runner to be reckoned with . 

On Saturday, Castner took second (25:02) in 
the eight-kilometer race, which included a very 
impressive Pomona Invitational field. 

"He displays all the characteristics of a true 
distance runner, ~ Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
said. "He's not afraid of anybody. ~ 

One of Castner's shirts explicitly displays his 
committed personality - ~Will race for food. "
