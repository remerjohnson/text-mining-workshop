Editorial 

Budgeting Western Civilization 
Admist a flurry of lobbYIng a t1 vitics aImed at heading off the Reagan 

AdmInistration's new budget proposal to severely cut back on federal aid 
to students, there ari es a rather flimsy attempt at improVIng the 
instruction of the "central , COntInUOUS and perennial culture of the 
Western world ," To ReclaIm a Legacy: A Report on the Humanities in Higher 
Education was recently released by our now familiar foe, ecretary of 
Edu ation William j. Bennett, The report , which is filled with sharp 

riticisms on the lackluster attitude of most colleges and universities 
towards the importance of the humanities and the purpose of 
education, discusses the merits of preserving the great principles of 
Western trad itional thought and transmitting its legacy to today' 
students, who are its "rightful heirs," Bennett's repon recomme nds that 
"The nation's colleges and universities must reshape their undergraduate 
curricula based on a clear vision of what constitutes an educated 
person ," He also maintains that the "Study of the humanities and 
Western civilIzation must take its place at the heart of the college 
curriculum," This can only be accomplished , Bennett states, if "Faculties 
put aside narrow departmentalism and instead work with administrators 
to shape a challengIng curriculum with a core of common studies," 

The intention of the report is noble enough , Bennett's claIm that 
students graduate knOWing little of their heritage is certaInly not 
unfounded , nor should It be trIvialized by the new age of technological 
advancement. However, it appears that Mr. Bennett has failed to apply 
his huntanislIc learnedness to his new job as secretary of education, 
Heed thi s definition of the humanitIes by Matthew Arnold which 
Bennett heralded in his report - "as the best that has been said , thought, 
written and otherwise expressed about the human experience. The 
humanities tells us how men and women of our own and other 
civilizations have grappled with life's enduring, fundamental questions: I 
What IS Justice7 What should be loved' What deserves to be defo::nded? 

. What IS courage? What is noble? What is base? Why do civilIzations 
flourish? Why do they decline?" He also cites Momaigne to support his 
conviction that learning and life are poorer without the humanities, 
Montalgne wrote: "A pupil should be taught what it means to know 
something. and what it means not to know it. what should be the 
deSIgn and end of study; what valor. temperance and Justice are; the 
difference between ambition and greed . loyalty and servitude. liberty 
and license; and the marks of free and sohd contentment," Can we 
assume then . that the humanities is a study 01 those aspects of life that 
have humanistic content and employ humanis tic methods? For if we 
can . as the National Endowment lor the Humanities (NEH) did when 
defining what aspects of the social sciences are to be considered part of 
the humanities (Sect. Bennett was head of the NEH for four years before 
a cepting his new position in Reagan's stable). then what does that say 
of how a federal budget is processed? There is hardly anything humane 
or humanistic . or even in the classical sense . Just . about padding the 
Ideology behind specific domestic hudget cutS with sell-righteous 
propagandizing, Irregardless of President Reagan 's and ecretary 
Bennett's belief that there are no swee t fruns to yield from the further 
perpetu.ltion of FDR's welfare state . both these taskmasters don't actually 
believe that massive cuts In finanCIal aid will produce a better educa ted 
population . Or do they? 

Let us assume. as brIght mathematiCIans. that less money made 
aeeeslble to hIgh school gradua tes will reduce the amount of youths 
entering college. What type of student. then , will be able to enter the 

university and sustain his education for four years? or cour e, the rich . 
Al o. the paltry qUOta of ·'select'· pers ns from the $25,000 and under 
category (although over 80% of them never have any real opportunity [0 
cmer college anyway because of either their socio-economic position 
which forces them [0 work. or poor high school instruc tion which 
renders their chan e of admi sion nearly obsolete). So the middle class 
gets socked again . Imagine that; mainstream American youth will miss 
finding out that we really are all members of a coherent culture and 
CIvilization . What will Mr. BenneH do then ; dis tribute h is recommended 
reading list of 38 "great texts" to every house hold? 

It is ironic that Mr. Bennett would compile a ample reading-list that 
includes the preaching of such egalita rians as Plato, Locke, Austen , 
Dickens, Marx. Faulkner and the irrepresssib le Martin Lutehr King, Jr, If 
one were to conduct a thorough reading of Bennett's "great 38," one 
would probably come away with a very severe disdai n for elitism. So 
what happened to our secretary of edu ation? We know what happened 
[0 Ronald Reagan; his favorite new author is insurance agent Tom 
Clancy. who wrote, The Hunt Jor Red October, a sea thriller sbout spook 
and nuclear submarines , which can be seen as a valuable contribution 
toward human progress, Leon Botstein , p res ident of Bard College, 
asserts that what Bennett describes as the core of Western civilization , 
"is itself an ideology, an artifical selection put together [0 underscore 
certain fundamental beliefs about the individual, the relation of 
individual to society, the definition of freedom; about the relationship of 
the natural and material world to the spiritual world; and fina lly, about 
the proper principles of governmen t." He merely wants to "civilize" 
mday's students in order to teach the supriority and expliCi t value of 
particular ideas. More than that, he has the intolerable arrogance [0 
believe that his intent will not be recognized as a ploy set up to silence 
his critics. 

No one doubts that Secretary Bennett is concerned about the 
dislocation of cultural values. Why else would he des ign a catechism of 
great works from which we are supposed to interpret that humanism 
breeds contempt for our fellow man? 

What is noble , Mr, Bennett. is a non-se lective compassion for huma n 
beings, What justice is, Mr, Bennett, is making education available to 
every person who desires it; without letting your political notions muddy 
the original intentions of our intellectual forefat hers, W hat deserves to 
be defended is our right as citizens to critcize our glass-house 
government without being insulted , and without having to be maligned 
as "beach bums." Courage is, Bi ll Bennett, in one word: honesty. W hat 
should be lovee! , Harvard scholar, is truth . CIvilizations flourish , Bennett, 
when their governments stop playing ch ildish cat and mouse games 
with the population . Civilizations de line. William, when you choose 
nuclear weapons over people. . 

In preparing Wisely for the future , beware of the man bearing 
"humanistic" gifts wrapped in careful rhe[Oric , This Administration . li ke 
no other before it, owes much of its success to fa lse ly d ignified orators, 
The debate over what ultimate values a society should p ursue is 
immen ely important. but let's not forget that there are millions of 
humans Out There who do not, or can not, really participate in this 
coffeeh ouse drama. Must we ignore the fundamental question here , Mr. 
Bennett , or. may I say. the concrete de ep tion. Bill ; are you, or are you 
not. slashing financial aId so as to provide your ideological cronies with 
a ripenll1g recruiting grl)und? - MJC

In 1983 Senate tcstimon}', Secreta!)' of Denfense 
Caspar Welllberger said . ''I'm saylllg that we MC

would not have a suffi ient degree of rel,lhaw!)'

h,IVe enough, in my opimon. to deter an anack against 
the Umled SIMes or its allies or other threats , If that 
should come in a particular form at a pal1lcuiar time 
using particula'r weapons." 

Of course. ne ither ReJgan nor Weinberger IS 
panicularly knowledgable about nuclear weapons 
(indeed. Reagan himself admitted last ye<lr th.1t he was 
surprised to fi nd out that most of the Soviets' weapons 
were on land-based missiles-ICBMs), 

The committee of str.llegic experts the President 
asscmbled-the President's CommiSSion on Strategic 
Forces. often caUed the Scowcroft Commission-came 
to a different conclUSion. After Imcrviewlng more than 
200 military and techlllcal expens. the Scowcroft 
Commtsslon said d Soviel surprise nuclear attack on 
the U was extremely unlikely; "To deler such surprIse 
3ttdCks. we can reasonably rely bolh on our other 
strategic forces and on the range of operational 
uncertainties thaI the SOVlcts would have to consider

Commission . It does not eXI,t? It IS dtlTicult to explain,

Federal cuts threaten financial aid/loans

,II1U would dlmll1atC thc Guarallleed

students, .lCcording to Tom Rutter , 
director of Student Financial SelVlccs.

Rutter SJld, but It .Ippears the)' will

The proposed student budger would 
set a $4000 maximum Iimir on fedeml

reducllon from the $6}00 maximum

At a Board of Regents meeting on

Supporting the President's budget

"I would likc to make it clcar that thiS

There has been a srrong reaction on 
campus to the budget proposal and 
Greg Arnold, UCSD's srudent body 
president'S council representative , has 
organized a financial aid action 
committee to fight the cuts. "These 
proposals undermine onl' of the basic 
concepts of higher education, that 
intellectual ability, not wealth , should 
determine a cess to a university 
education," Arnold sa id .

said 

The budget proposals have spclrked 
action , both on the P"rts 01 students

been studying rhe possible efrects of the

Rutter saId th,1t he would re-package 
Student aid in an dfon to lessen the 
effects. 

The U llIversity of Cahforni.1 dnd the 
Statc provide over $5 million p r year 
ror srudl'nt aid , and Ruiter would try to 
givc those srudents who would he cut 
off from fedeml progmms fundmg from 
UC and stilte monies. He does not 
expect to be .. ble to fully replace fedenll 
funding 

But ror now, Ruiter IS c.lUtiously 
optimistic -I don't believe the financial 
aid CUtS WII! pass. The 54000 (maxImum 
aid) cap would destroy the private 
colleges, ilnd congress Will prevent that 
from happening," he said. "A smJII 
percentage of our srudents are <I t max 
rederal .lId levels, but a ver)' large 
per<:entagc of pnvare ulllvcrsll)' students 
.Ire." He Jdded that "the CJp would at 
the very least be set much higher. " 

But a spokesman for Rep , Hunter said 
"the eaSIest way to get .Iround rhe 
problem of private edu<:atlon is tUItion 
rJX ned ItS ." to reimburse parems who 
sent their <:hl ldren to pnvarc

While Hunter has yet to mJke ,I stand 
1m the proposals, hiS spokcsman s.lId

The stude nts have lobbied against 
these cuts before , and their erfort in

Eventful illustrator 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

A MASSIVE LIGHT grey-green dr.lwing table dominates her module of SpdCe at the UnIversity EvenIs Office. Above the table , one 
of her gentle pencil illustrations reminds Ruth Baily, 
program and promotions manager for UEO, of her 
years as a visual ails student here at UC D during the 
70s. 

Batly descnbes UCSD 111 the 70~ in images most 
students reserve lor the precedtng decade. ·We would 
never see a fr.nemity or soronty on campus then ," said 
Baily, 'There was a higher con em for other people's 
causes than you see today, We cared about the events 
of the world outside the UCSD community," 

Though Baily is now known for her illustrations, she 
was not Interested in the visual all depallment's 
dis iple-type student to teacher relationships and 
deCided to pursue a Muir Special Projects major in writing 
screenplays, She ompleted a screenplay about the 
personal torment of a Russian dissident, sending it off to 
motion picture producers. This was before she began 
work at UEO where she has come in contact with "so 
many people III the movie industry who made me realize 
most of the industry is just gloss. Gore Vidal said to me, 
'Never say anything negative III a screenplay, Don't say I 
won't go to the ranch, say, You go to the ranch and I'll be 
there later.'" The RUSSian screenplay was returned, 
unopened, b), every producer, but Baily feels , "It it doesn 't 
work out, I will not slash my wrists," 

Baily is one who takes one form of rejection as a 
stimulus to tty another angle. Her redirected dfons 
have helped her bring to UCSD a mu h more 
extensive UEO program which includes sneak 
previews of first run motion pictures , the International 
Film Series and an excellent lecture series, Since UCSD 
is one of the few coUeges with 35mm equipment, Baily 
has obtained what she considers quality movies, such 
as The Killing Fields , Under Fire , Places in tile Heart , 
Footloose and at times real trashers, like Fast Fo/ward 
and Heaven Help Us , Last year's Japanese film festival 
played to sold-out houses during the entire senes, And 
lecture series hi:ld memorable moments like Douglas 
Adams, author of Httchihcr Guide to the Galaxy, arriving 
with no idea of what he might do, even having to 
borrow a copy of his book from the auffrence for the 
reading. Next quaner, the headliner for the lecture 
series will be Kun Vonnegut, who will speak on "How 
to get a Job like Mine." 

A job like Ruth Baily's might seem ideal to an all 
student interested in the entertainment world , "As an 
art student, I was a little too in awe of what Hollywood 
seemed to represent ," said Baily, "What helped me 
break away from that awe was the experience we had 
WIth Gene Wilder when we invited him here, He 
didn 't charge us anything for rh:e lecture, JUSt a couple 
of nights at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club and a 
can of tennis balls, 

"He warned us on the telephone, he might be on the 
verge of a nervous breakdown, he was going through a 
divorce . had recent oral surgery and , to add to the 

confusion . he got lost drivll1g down to UCSD, At the 
event he was fine . The students asked him some of the 
most insulting questions I have ever heard . He fielded 
every one of them i:lnd did not snap back at the 
audience. But afterwards he was like a basket of jelly, 

"Nobody asked him about maklllg films , so I stalled 
talking to him about hiS film Quahscr Fortune Has a 
Cousin ill tile Bra/lX, whIch I admired for its ability to 
express the feelings of an immigrant !like the main 
chameter 111 her own screenplayJ, He said , 'You can't 
write about feelings. Quakser hi:ls nothing to do with ( 
feelings. The film IS about rwo people who were made 
for each other, absolutely devoted to each other, but 
were Victims of a class system that destroyed their 
relationship, So the girl did the only humane thing 
and left him .' I said that is not what it was all about, 
which was my big mistake. It's about an American girl 
who thinks this guy is cute and funny, She takes him 
on for a lark, then when she realizes she is over her 
h'ead, she dumps him, In the end , Quakser takes what 
little she gave him to free himself from his depressed 
world , Wilder totaUy denied my interpretation , doing 
his hysterical schtick banging his head against the roof 
of my car. When we got to the Beach and Tenni 
Club, he warned me whatever I write had better be 
commercial; there is no room for something deeply 
moving in Hollywood ," 

There may not be room in Hollywood , but Bmly will 
continue to bring quality entertall1ment to UCSD 
through UEO events and her brochure 
illustrations,

The need for good long relief is made

An upsetting weeke~d 
By ALICIA AGOS, SI'O'" Ec/Ilt l , 

T HERE WAS NOTHING roo unusual .Ibout last weekend's schedule lor the men's volleyball team. UCSD , 
very much the Division III squad, was 
slated to , yet ~Igalll. bee a tough DII'. 1 
school- not JUSt once but twice. Former 
national champio n Penn State and 
equa lly powerful Long BeJ<.:h tJte were 
the opponents during a very he,\\,), 
weekend of play for the Tmons. Fnda}' 
night the Dil'. III gods were on UCSD's 
Side, and, 111 impreSSIVe f"shlOn , the San 
Diego men upset a much-traveled Penn 
Swte team. 15-7. 15-1 t. 11-15. 15-1 l. 
However, the cnthust,lsm .lIld 
confidence of the Oil'. I vktor)1 had 
worn orr by the next ua}', .Ind It was 

p~tty much the same old stor)' SaturdJY 
night as Long BeJch StJtC did away with 
UCSD III three str'llght games , 15-12, 
15·3, 15- 12 

Agall1st Penn St,l(e, .limost evcf),thing 
went nght lor the Tmons. The <111-
Important passll1g was right there . as 
were the deadly kills .Ind the strong 
blockll1g. However, servll1g-and 
UCSD's lack thereol - agaln threw d 
wrench in the Triton game. UCSD's 
team se rving percentage was nOlhll1g to 
be proud 01, but the enthUSIasm and th e 
confidence whICh the San Diego pl..tyers 
showed against Penn State 'arried them 
over the servlllg 11I1e to ~111 .Idmlrable 
and surprising win. 

The fan sUppOrt clearly helped the 
rritons dunng thL' game. Setter George 
KllIghrs also seemed to PUt J sp,lrk In 
h\s' tc,llnmJtes' pl<l}'. Knights, who 
replaced Eri<.: Hallman at the end of the 
third game_ set strongly ,md confidently 
throughout the rest of the match . 
Klllghts said arter the match , "At this 
point in the season, thiS is our biggest 
win III our career. We were lazzeci !O 

Dave Halgmllta.s /Jan II hey pluycrat the net. 

kill them. 1 hope the sun is shlllmg 
dUring the rest of thetr trip, be<.:ause 
those guys arc gOlllg to have .I long trip 
up the masl "(P.:nn t,ne IS t,lklng 
advantage of Spnng Bretlk to eSGlpe the 
Pennsylvania snow and trJvel up and 
down the West Coast to play many 
Callfornid sc hools.) 

Frtday night UCSD appeared to have 
found their niche. They beat a strong 
Dlv. 1 sc hool not JUSt on a fluke. but 
wi th a good solid leam effon. Hallman 

commented, "Now we ,III know what It 
takes to win ." SWtl Criswell , who was a 
domlllcm tor<.:e al the net throughout 
thc mat<.:h . said about the win , "We 
didn't m~lkc uumh mlst.tkes What we've 
worked h,lrd on In prllCtl<.:e paid ofr 
wl1Ight Everyone had a good match . 
We were reaUy I1red up. George came III 
,md set the way we wanted 10 be set. He 
took the IllltlatlVe and played very 
small . We havcn't gone III a match 
thlllking WI.' could beat someone III a 
long nme. We'vc /IIIOW'1 we could bear 
them. ThiS can turn bur entire season 
around Tomorrow against Long Beach, 
t! the momentum ClIITIeS through . we'll 
walk .III over them ." 

But SJturd~IY W,IS another day and .I 
whole difTerent story for UCSD. It was a 
predictable mat<.:h , with the reputed 
Long Be~lCh dOi ng the walking over 
UCSD- nOl the other way around . 
Senior John He<1derson said. "We were 
reaU)' prepared lor Penn tate. We 
h,ldn't had .I mJtch tn £\\!o weeks, so we 
were able to work and prJctice on J 101 
of thl ngs. Fnd..l)' I1Ight we concentr.Hed 
on our own game. We didn't adjust our 
game 10 them, and 1 think if" more 01 
our serves had gone tn , we could 've beaten 
them herter. We could 've played berter. 
Against Long Beach. I don't know what 
happened . I'm snll trylllg to figure It out. 
We did not pdSS well. which mdde It 
hJrd on our olTense , which In turn 
made it h<lrd on our defense. We know 
that we are capable of pla)'ing the way 
we did agalllst Ppnn State all the lime 
We have the potential and our coach is 
looking for a way to bring that out of us ." 

A week from today UCSD hosts 
Georgc M<lson College. The match will 
be in the Main G)'m and Will beglll at 
7:30 pm. ~
