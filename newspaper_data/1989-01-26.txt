Benefit: 
AIDS Veto 
Overriden 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council last night 
overrode President Maynard 
Dimmesdale's veto of an alloca-
tion for an upcoming AIDS vic-
tim 'benefit. 

At last week's meeting, the 
council approved an allocation of 
$300 from the General Unallo-
cated fund for an upcoming pho-
tograph exhibit at the Grove 
Gallery to benefit AIDS victims. 

Dimmesdale subsequently ve-
toed the measure, and Vice Pre-
sident-External Mordecai Potash 
led the override effort saying, "I 
think if something good comes 
up , something powerful, we 
should support it." 

"I do agree that this is a very 
important program," Dimmesdale 
aid, "But there are other sources 

of funding, and I think that's 
something we need to consider." 

Dimmesdale argued that Gen-
eral Unallocated funds are limited, 
and that it is the council's respon-
sibility to make the money last 
until the end of the year. 

"Part of government, unfortu-
nately, is to make decisions [based] 
on funding," he said. 

Public Relations Commissioner 
Tom Rhee suggested an alternate 
way to fund the benefit, saying 
that allocating the money from 
another source would be better 
than simply drawing from the 
General Unallocated fund . 

He added that if other funds 
could not be found, he would 
allocate money from his own pub-
lic relations budget, aying, " I will 
guarantee [that] I will find the 
money."

An Ancient ArtÂ· Sam Yeh demonstrated Chinese Calli-
graphy at Revelle Plaza yesterday as part of Asiar:' Awareness 
Week. ' 

Potash argued that the money 
should come from the entire A.S. 
Council. He said that if he wanted 
to take the money out of his own 
discretionary funds, he could, but 
added, "I'd really like the money 
to come fromm General Unallo-
cated. " 

"I feel very strongly tha~ it's 
going to be the greatest error of 
this council if we don't approve 
this override," he said, stressing 
the important of AIDS awareness 
among students, as well as the 
money the exhibit would raise. 

Vice President-Financial Ed-
uardo Rallo-Verdugo agreed with 
Potash, aying, "I'm concerned. I 
think this is a really good way to 
educate the student population . . . 

it's great for the A.S. to support 
something like this." 

The council also approved an 
allocation of $650 from the Gen-
eral Unallocated fund for a lec-
ture by Attalah Shabazz, Mal-
colm X's daughter, as part of 
Black History month. 

Also at last night's meeting, 
Student Advocate Bard-Alan Fin-
Ian urged the council to take 
action against the new nighttime 
parking proposal. 

He announced that he is circu-
lating a petition opposing the 
mea ure, and aid, "I can't believe 
there's anyone on campus who 
wouldn't want to sign this . . . 
except the people making the 
money." 

UTe Mall Receives 
Bomb Threat Call 

By DA VID WYNER 
Associate News Editor 

University Towne Center, a 
popular La Jolla shopping mall, 
received a bomb threat at approx-
imately 3:30 p.m. last Saturday, 
ac~ording to mall management. 

Mark Ashton, UTC's General 
Manger, said that one of the mer-
chant , whom he was unable to 
identify, received a threat from an 
unidentified caBer who claimed 
that a bomb was located in the 
center court area of the mall. 

The threat was brought to the 
attention of mall security who 
then contacted the San Diego 
Police. Upon arrival, officers 
"made a thorough search of the 
area and found nothing," accord-
ing to Ashton. 

According to San Diego Fire 
Department pokesper on Jon 
McDonald, the department's Ex-
plosiv Device Team (EDT) was 
"not called out to [respond to] 
any incident at UTe." 

Ashton also said that no eva-
cuation of any section of the mall 
was ever ordered . 

Merchants in the food pavilion 
section of the mall reported a dif-
ferent story. 

According to Lori Coyle, man-
ager of the pavilion's Pups on a 
Pol, merchants were told by mall 
security to "close our doors and 
wait out in the parking lot." 

Coyle said she did not know if a 
general evacuation of the custo-
mers was ordered, but speculated 
that closing the doors to the indi-
vidual stands in the pavillion drove 
the customers out of the area. 
From the parking lot , Coyle ob-
served "more than raj normal 
[amount] of people leaving the 
mall." 

"It' not like everyone just de-
cided to go home [at the same 
time]," he said. 

Coyle said she shut down her 
store after being approached by a 
mall ecurity officer who, accord-
ing to Coyle, "whispered, 'There's 
a potential bomb threat. I need 
you to close your door .' " 

San Diego Police Department 
spokesperson Dave Cohen out-
lined the procedures generally fol -
lowed in the event of a bomb 
threat. 

According to Cohen, the prim-
ary response to such a threat is to 
di patch patrol officers to assess 
the situation determi ning if the 
EDT is needed . 

He noted , however, that it is 
"not uncommon for the [EDT] 
not to be called ." 

He mentioned that the reason 
for not calling the EDT vary with 
ind: 'idual situations. He added 
that police determine the need for 
the team's response partially on 
the basis of information available 
about the individual who made 
the threat. 

He cited the age and sex of the 
caller and the nature of the threat 
as being among that information. 

Cohen said that police in-
volvement in such incidents is 
"extremely minimal"and that mall 
security and the fire department 
"would have worked together on 
the incident." 

UTC mall security would not 
provide any information on the 
incident without proper authori-
zation from Ashton, which he 
refused to give.

Accounting Error Hides $35,000 AS UCLA Deficit A Board of kegents com-
mittee last week selected 
Guillermo Rodriguez, a jun-

recommendation for Stu-

LOS ANGELES - Four years 
of bookkeeping errors hid a 
$35,OOO-plus deficit from under-
graduate government, according 
to ASU LA officials. 

Between 1983 and 1987, the 
Student Government Accounting 
staff repeatedly understated ex-
penses, recorded income twice and 
overstated income, ASUCLA 
Executive Director Ja on Reed 
aid la t month. He said the staff 

committed no illegalities. 
Reed would not give the name 

of taff member involved - e -
eral of whom quit before a deficit 
was suspected in earl y 19 7. 
However, both Reed and Under-
graduate Pre ident Mike Meehan 

hiatus 

said the deficit will create no 
major problem. 

Undergraduate government, 
part of ASUCLA, will likely rid 
itself of the deficit in one or two 
years, they estimated. 

The current deficit i equal to 
about four percent of the govern-
ment's annual $1 million income 
before expenses. In May 1987, it 
peaked at nearly $94,000, accord-
ing to audit report , but income 
from 1987-88 fi cal year reduced 
it. 

Meehan and Reed attributed 
the accounting error to expand-
ing government operations and 
an inexperienced, overworked taff. 

"The burgeoning number of 
program, the increa ing number 
of student programmer , and the 
inc rea ed budget had impl 

hiatus 

outstripped the capabilitie of the 
staff, their expertise, their availa-
ble tools and the pace in which 
we operate," they wrote in a state-
ment to the Board of Control, 
ASUCLA' policy-making body. 

To prevent future problems, 
government accounting has hired 
more experienced staff member 
and will create a position to over-
see the bookkeeping proce s, Reed 
said . 

Additionally, undergraduate 
government will require official

I~ UC NEWS 
Former UCSB Chancellor 
Has Problems Paying Fines 

SA TA BARBARA Former UCSB Chancellor 
Robert Huttenback and his wife Freda have so far 
paid little of the more than $70,000 in fines they were 
charged by Santa Maria uperior Court Judge Zel 
Canter. according to count probation department 
officials. 

Dr. Huttenback had been making payments of 
$200 per month to the probation department with the 
under tanding that beginning Jan. I, he would make 
monthly payments of at lea t $1 ,000 for the duration 
of hi five-year probation period. 

However. a wrench wa thrown into the works last 
month at a court hearing held to correct a clerical 
error in a court order regarding penalties the 
Huttenbacks were to pay. At the Dec. 12 hearing. 
Judge Canter informed the court that he had expected 
the fines to be paid in a lump sum, rather than in 
installments. 

Santa Monica attorney Dennis Fischer. who is 
acting as the Huttenbacks legal counsel in the appeal 
of their felony conviction. objected to Canter's 
payment chedule, claiming that a lump payment 
would create "undue hardship" for his clients. 

The judge' announcement came as a surprise to the 
probation department. where it is accepted procedure 
for "a fine to be paid over the course of time, 
according to the probation officer's stipulations as to 
how (payment is to be made)."

UCSB Ethnic Requirement 
Gets Negative Vote For Now 

SA TA BARBARA - Progress toward initiating 
a two-course ethnic s.lUdies requirement at UCS B was 
dealt a fatal blow by the faculty of the College of 
Letters and Science, who voted by a margin of two to 
one last December against the proposal. 

The re ults, which were not tabulated until la t 
week, proved disappointing to some students engaged 
in a long-fought battle 10 implement the requirement. 
But sources within the college indicated that the issue 
of adding an ethnic studies course to the University'S 
general education requirements has no~ been 
abandoned. 

BLOOM COUNTY 

Letter and Science faculty arc expected to gather 
in mid-February at a ~pecial meeting scheduled 
pecifically to address acceptable alterna tivcs to the 

recent I defeated proposal. 
Administrators ee the proce s as much more 

complicated than agreeing to rubber stamp an 
addition to a complex and sometimes inflexible 
education (l enda. The proposal has been and will 
co ntinue to be examined by various committees. 
subcommittees and others who comprise the many 
levels of bureaucracy that the completed proposal will 
eventually encou nter. 

The current effort to require eth nic tudie as a 
general education component has been actively in the 
works at UCSB for the past two year. By 
comparison. UC Santa Cruz officials spent five years 
placing a simi lar plan into motion. 

Had the faculty voted in favor of the two-course 
requirement, which was endor ed by both the faculty 
legislature and the Ethnicity Task Force of the 
Academic Senate, students would have had to enroll 
in at least one course that focused on "the intellectual, 
social and cultural experience and history of one of 
the following group: Native American. Afro-
American , Chicano Latinos, and Asian Americans," 
according to the propo al. 

The second course was slated to provide Ka 
comparative or integrative context for understanding 
the experience of oppressed and excluded racial 
minorities ... 

Now, committee members who drafted the 
proposal are expected to recon ene prior to the as-
yet-unscheduled general assembly to discuss and 
devi e option, i sues and que tions for presentation 
to t heir colleagues.

Bomb Hoax Evacuates UCSB 
Off-Campus Apartments 

SA TA BARBARA - An area surrounding the 
main office and laundry facilities of the UCSB-owned 
Santa Ynez Apartments was evacuated Thur day, 
Jan. 19 after an object suspected to be a bomb was 
discovered in a postal drop-box. 

UCSB Police and Sheriffs department officers were 
summoned by the apartment complex's manager at 
approximately 10: 15 a.m. after a loud beeping noise 
was heard emitting from the postal box . 

The officers contacted a U.S. postal inspector, who 
removed a three-inch by four-inch package bearing 
the same mailing address and return address . Then, 
due to the suspicious nature of the package, the Santa 
Barbara Sheriffs Department's Hazardous Object 
Team was summoned . 

by Berke Breathed 

After roping off the area, the bomb di posal 
unit attempted to detonate the object by placing it 
within a trongbox and detonating a small explosive 
beneath it. But when the object failed to explode, 
investigators confirmed it wa a hoax device. 
probably intended to scare or intimidate someone. 

Detective Stan Mathiason said there wa no 
indication that explosives were in the package. 
Although police released no further information 
regarding the nature of the device, a Daily Nexus 
reporter observed that the device appeared to consist 
in part of several nine-volt batteries taped together 
with black electrician's tape.

UCLA Students Surveyed About 
Proposed On-Campus Pub 

LOS ANGELES - ASUCLA surveyed 5,300 
UCLA students, faculty and staff members last 
quarter about their opinion on a proposed 'campus 
pub. 

The five-page survey included questions about 
general attitudes toward serving alcohol on campus, 
suggestions for possible pub locations and questions 
about beer and wine drinking habits. 

Although ASUCLA officia ls have contemplated 
opening a pub for more than five years, several 
professors have opposed such proposals. 

Chief among these was Edward Rada of the 
economics department , who has twice blocked 
ASUCLA's bids for a liquor license, citing ethical and 
religious concerns. In the summer of 1985, Margaret 
Snow, assistant to the ASUCLA executive director, 
predicted that a student pub is unlikely "as long as 
Professor Rada is a member of the faculty ."

Student accounting sometimes

UCLA government's May 1987 
financial statements. It also re-
corded some incomes twice, when 
it received verbal commitments

Doomed Love 
Editor's Note; Hunter S, Thompson wrote this column in March of 
1987, when George Bush's campaign effort suffered as a result of the 
Iran-contra scandal, In light of the recent inauguration. Hunter S. 
Thompson's 19 7 observations are particular~l' intriguing, 

I was just ettling in to watch the presidential press conference on TV last Thurday night when my phone rang, It was the hot line num ber, a sure sign of trouble, ,., 
ever mind that, I thought, I am working, I can't be disturbed at this 

time. This might even be Reagan's last pre s conference, He had not 
been looking good recently; he seemed about 110 years old and utterly 
d isoriented at all times . ... Hi s eyes had a viscou ,jelly-like appearance 
and he had taken to letting hi hands flap crazily at his side when he 
walked down lhe halls of the White House, even when photographers 
were present. Some very goofy-looking photographs had turned up in 
the press room, but none of the newspaper would use them, for fear of 
alarming the pUblic ... . 

My phone was still ringingas Reagan made his appearance. I tried to 
ignore the noise, but after 30 or 40 rings I got nervous and picked it up. 

It was Tex, from the trailer court , a nd he sounded frantic. " It's 
Loretta!"he shouted. "She's dyi ng. You better get here quick, Doc. and 
bring the chloroform." 

" What?" I said. "Are you crazy" Call me back after the press 
conference, " 

" o!"hescreamed. "She'sgoingoU/!Thi i it! I already have herin 
the bathtub." 

Ye gods. I thought. What now? And why chlorofor m? But I had no 
choice. Tex wa a dangerous brute and Loretta was a drinker. ... and if 
she died, I would be named as the Family Doctor and flogged in pUblic. 
It was an evil situation. and I had somehow become a slave to it. On my 
way outside to the Jeep I picked up a pint bottle of No, 417 chloroform 
from the medicine tank . It had been around a while, but I felt it was 
active. 

The blizzard was still raging and the road was slick with black ice, 
When I arrived at Tex's trailer I heard sounds of screami ng and 
high-pitched cries from inside. The door was ajar, and I found them 
both in the bathroom. Loretta was lying in the bathtub, and her eyes 
were rolled back in her head. Tex was on his knees beside the tub, 
trying to keep her head above water. He seemed hysterical. " Why did 
you do it?" he screamed. "I can't stand to see you die like th is!" 

T he bathroom was full of water, and I could see flecks of blood on the tile around the tub. Loretta made a low crying noise and tried to sit up in the water, but Tex lost his grip on her and she fell 
heavily sideways. 

When Tex saw me in the mirror he went all to pieces and began 
sobbing, unable to get his breath. He reacheg behind him and lifted a 
tall bottle of green Chartreuse to his lips, tllen he poured two large 
jiggers and gave one to Loretta. " Here, honey," he said . "Drink this . It 
can't go on much longer." 

She swallowed the green liquid", and then she jerked straight up in 
the water and began retching horribly, 

"She's dying," he said cal mly. "We can't help her now. It's the booze. 
She finally went too far," 

Lo retta groaned desperately and tried to speak, but he suddenly 
stood up and began hosing her down with a high-powered shower 
massage unit. The water made a cruel thudding noise as it beat down 
on her stomach. 

Tex was still jabbering about Death and Whiskey and Punish ment, 
then he asked if I'd brought the chloroform, "We'll need it by morn-
ing," he said quietly. "Toward the end she11 go into convulsions." 

Then he seized my arm and pulled me out of the bathroom, "Don't 
worry:" he said. "She'll be OK, but she has to keep taking her 
medicine." 

" Medicine?" I said , "What is it?" 
"Vitamins," he replied . He showed me a handful of thick whi te 

tablets that looked vaguely familiar. "She needs two more right now," 
he said . "I want to teach her a lesson she'l never fo rget." 

Suddenly I understood . "You swine!" I snarled . "You evil bastard! 
These are not vitamins. This is Antabuse," 

" Why not?" he said . " I tried everything else." 
It was ugly. Antabuse is a brutally powerful emetic that is only 

triggered by alcohol and only used by terminal drunkards who know 
they will die if they even think a bout drinking a ny more whiskey. It is 
li ke wiring a pipe bomb to you r transmission that will only ex plode 
if you shift into reverse, 

I felt dirty and wrong for just being there. Tex wanted to keep the 
chloroform, but) packed it up in my kit and left quickly. It was still 
snowing. 

By the time I got home the presidential press conference was over, but Reagan had enjoyed it so much that he seemed reluctant to leave. On his way down the hall to h is quarters he paused long 
enough . to drive another savage spike through the heart of George 
Bush, confirming on camera that his loyal vice president and one-time 
heir apparent was at least as guilty as Poindexter and lunatic Oliver 

orlh . 
Bush denied it , but his lie~ only made him seem s leazier. His face has 

become swollen and he is said to be plagued by a growth of dead fatty 
tissue on h is back , which is gathering in a lump in the area between his

Assorted Vinyl 
Mismanaged 
Editor: 

Cry me a river. 
To hear Sharon Lai of Assorted 

Vinyl (A V) lament the store's 
poor financial condition as a result 
of past business decisions makes 
my disc skip, Assorted Vinyl fills 
a need in our community. Shoot! , 
the next clo est record store is in 
University Towne Centre. Yet the 
rea on that A V does not have a 
corner on the college market is 
because of its reluctance to accept 
for real the students' listening 
ta tes. For certain, we do not all 
listen to Stiff Little Fingers, Blood 
on the Saddle, or the Dead 
Ken nedys. 

When the management be-
co mes less dogmatic in force-
feeding us its music, then students 
may start entering the store again. 
Once we enter , then maybe, 
Sharon, you will consider offer-
ing us the following: 

I) a less oppressive bu yi ng 
atmosphere - one where a per-
son is not intimidated to ask 
where the latest Richard Marx 
can be fou nd. and do so without 
being snickered at; 

2) a broader selection of music 
- the entire UCS D community 
should feel co mforta ble to walk 
in and find his or her music, 
including fac ulty, staff, and 
admi nistration . Such is not the 
case presently: we have never seen 
a professor in the store; 

3) compact discs are the wave 
- hurry up and paddle or get out 
of the water because we are tired 
of constantly having to order our 
music. (Sharon, you yourself said 
that impulse buying is a large part 
of your business: well, that's a 
fresh impulse when I have to wait 
a week for my Basia disc!) 

A similar disconcerting mindset 
prevails over at radio station 
KSDT. This past year the under-
graduates paid $23,000 through 
their student fees to these people. 
And for what? For one hour of 
music each day, heard only on the 
Hump ?; for obtuse, offensive, 
Eastern hemisphere underground 
music?; for a signal not receivable 
in the dorms and only so in the 
outside community via cable?; for 
an excl usive, somewhat oppres-
sive clique of people who refuse to 
play what we want and by their 
nature hes itate to admit anyone 
who might pop on a Depeche 
Mode, J oe Jackson, U2, Led Zep-
pelin, or Guns 'n' Roses disc? 

Insight 
Appreciated 
Editor: 

I'm writing in response to 
the editorial by Lara Mihata 
entitled, "All U.S. citizens Are 
Equally American" published 
1-23-89. 

I would justliketosaythank 
you for the insight into what it 
means to be of Japaneseances-
try in an AnglO-dominated 
society. However, my initial 
reaction to the anicle was very 
different. 

Deejays regularly beg for per-
sons to call In and win free tickets 
to concerts, only to be deafened 
by the silence of telephones not 
ringing. Your format is prohibi-
tive to massive student involve-
ment. We want to hear what we 
want to hear, not what you want 
us to hear. We are paying you 
enough money; play what we 
want. 

Assorted Vinyl and KSDT 
could potentially fill critical voids 
in our educational environment. 
However, their dogmatic ways of 
telling us what to like, by inhibit-
ing student involvement, and by 
not responding to the community 
they purportedly serve will spell 
their dewnfall. 

There is no ostensible reason 
why these two enterprises cannot 
functIOn as well as the Grove 
Caffe - the most financially suc-
cessful student enterprise that this 
campus has ever seen . When they 
begin to cater to the UCSD 
community, only then will they 
fill our needs as the Grove does so 
capa bly. Assorted Vinyl and 
KSDT will never do that as they 
presently stand ,

GPA Policy 
Not Unfair 
Editor 

It seems to me your editorial 
"Typical Bureaucracy" misses the 
point, or at least an important 
point , Among UC campuses San 
Diego is unique in admitting stu-
dents to impacted departments as 
pre-majors , 

The rationale for this policy is 
that it is fairer to evaluate stu-
dents on appropriate college level 
work, rather than to rely on high 
schoolGPA, subject to wide fluc-
tuation from school to school, or 

Being myse lf 110t totally un-
like your depiction of the bar-
room idiot who asked if your 
uncle "flew 'Zeroes' in WW 
II ," I felt rather defensive to-
wards Anglo culture after read-
ing the article, I felt like I was 
being blamed for what had 
been done to you. In essence I 
felt like I had been prejudged, 
generalized and neatly categor-
ized , 

That's a horrible feeling, but 
I suspect it's trivial in relation 
to what citizens of Japanese 
ancestry put up with every day 
of their lives . 

Bryan Davison 

standardized tests which have their 
own problems. Admission to the 
major is then re erved for those 
best qualified, 

The involved departments feel 
that in fairness to students who 
do not have the time and / or 
resources to repeat screening 
courses, that grades be averaged ,Â· 
This policy helps as many stu-
dents as it hurts . A non-averaged 
repeat policy encourages students 
who are doing "C" work to fail 
the course and repeat it, a proce-
dure which further impacts crowd-
ed courses and extends time to 
graduation at a time when the 
campus is turning away almost 
half of its eligible applica nts. 

I believe that bureaucratic 
games are being played, but) per-
sonally do not feel that the culprit 
is the UCSD Committee on Edu-
cational Policy.

Suggestions 
Editor: 

In light of the recent news con-
cerning the rise in student fees as 
well as a considerable price hike 
for parking, there is no doubt 
there should be alternate proposi-
tions for accumulating money for 
the campus. 

I have a couple of suggestions: 
I) Special trashcans should be 

set up next to Urey Hall and the 
Humanities Undergraduate Lib-
rary, These special receptacles will 
be designated for the collection of 
the gross num bers of flyers handed 
out around the Revelle Plaza, 
These flyers would be accumu-
lated and recycled . 

2) The petitioners located 
throughout campus should be 
required to pay a threeÂ·to five cent

president is scheduled to meet vis-
iting dignitaries or appear for a 
photo opportunity with the media. 
"They don 't want him around," 
said one Washington journalist. 
"That thing on his back is grow-
ing so fast that he 's beginning to 
look like the Hunchback of Notre 
Dame," 

Q and A: What do you thin.k the 
University should do. to alleviate 
the parking problem on campus? 

Bush has never been known for 
his ability to command personal 
loyalty from his staff people or 
even his family, Not even Repub-
lican politicians want to be pho-
tographed with him, and in recent 
weeks the desertion rate was begin-
ning to look like a run on a Brazi-
lian bank .. ,. First his own son 
betrayed him in incriminating per-
sonal correspondence that showed 
up in the Miami Herald, then 
Arab arms dealer Adnan Kha-
shoggi went sideways on him by 
offering to produce canceled 
checks to prove George was lying 
when he said he had never soli-
cited illegal contributions for the 
~Contras" in Nicaragua, and finally 
the President trashed him on 
national TV ... . But all that was 
as nothing compared with the 
filth that dropped Monday when 
Manucher Ghorbanifar an-
nounced that he was now eager to 
testify before Congress and tell 
everything he knows about the 
dark underbelly of the Iran-contra 
affair, including "who is lying and 
where the money went ," 

Many heads will roll in 
Washington v. hen that happens 
and there is no joy tonight in the 
home of George Bush, They will 
soon be loading him up on the 
tumbril with the others and carry-
ing him off to the guillotine.

petitioners) are taking advantage 
of the vast number of rushing 
students willing to sign anything 
just so they can get the petitoners 
off their backs. If the cause is 
important enough, the petitioners 
will be willing to pay this tax. 

They should sell less per-

T he Greek ,y tern tsn't for e~e ry bod ~. Some people decide tha i these organin-
lio ns j u I don 't fit in with their 
lifestyle, while other, feel that 
the~ don't want to go through the 
selection process to be admitted 
Into a group. 

"Mv main concern with both 
fra ter~ities and soro rities is that 
they are exclusive," said visiting 
profe or Terry Odendal of the 
Communication department. "I 
que tion the ~tandards of accept-
ance. 

Greek say that there are cer-
tain characteristics they look for 
in an individual , such a leader-
ship potential and motivation, yet 
there is talk of other factors in-
fluencing their election process. 

One factor which is aid to 
sway fra ternit ies and so rorities is 
phys tcal appearance . Wh ile 
Greeks deny that this carries any 
weight. a member of one frater-
nit on campu recounted a story 

of a girl who wa, rejected as a 
little ,i ter becau,e she was over-
weight a nd quiet. 

" We had ,uch a difficult time 
deciding, but , in the end, we de-
cided against her. I think we really 
mis ed out in the end," he said. 

"The whole process i a number 
game." aid o ne student who re-
centl) rushed . "It' a lousy meth-
od of selection no matter which 
ca mpus you are on." 

The selection proces can be 
p yc hologically devastating for 
man) of the tudent who rush 
and don't get accepted. This is 
particularly true for those school 
",here the Greek system domi-
nates campu. ocial life. 

"At myoid school. there wa 
tremendous pre ure to go Greek 
becau e it wa the thing to do ," 
said a student who transferred 
from a school on the ea t coast. 
"Fortunately, at UC D there isn't 
quite the pre ure to go Greek, so 
it's not as bad ." 

orne students are able 10 take 
rejection less personall y while 
others experience a evere loss of 
self-esteem. "It is important for 
the student to realize that he / she 
is not neces arily rejected becau e 
he or she has nothing to offer, 
but , rather, because the people in 
charge of deciding are looki ng for 
omething specific," the tran fer 

student said. 
Another natio nwide concern 

about Greek i a practice known 
a hazing. Hazing can be defined 
as making so mebody do some-
thing involuntarily. There have 
been about 15 hazing related 
deaths si nce the early '70s. 

So far, there has not been a 
problem with this at UCSD. Most 
of the fraternities do not practice 
hazing. There is one group on 
ca mpus which has been said to 
practice hazing. The fraternity 
members claim, however, that 
their rite of pas age techniques 
a re only in the spirit of unity and 
brotherhood and not intended to 
hurt anybody.

This grou p is the Al pha Phi

monly referred to as the black fra-
ternity. This label is not necessar-
il} the case though, as there are 
other et hnic groups involved . 

"We a re not affiliated with the 
Inter-Fraternal Council (IFC) be-
cause they belie ve that we a re 
guilty of hazing and, as a result , 
refuse to recogni ze us," sa id 
Deymon Fle ming, vice president 
of Alpha Ph i Alpha . "To u , haz-
ing is not em barassing. It 's an 
hono r. It brings everyone togeth-
er. 0 many people feel that we 
are maliciou to our pledges, but 
we are not making them do a ny-
thing they do not want to do." 

Pat Mudge!. Brad Mendelsohn, and Todd Weintraub of Phi Delta 
Theta fraternity . 

"There have been arrests in the 
past because of our public behav-
ior," Fleming said , because "Peo-
ple misinterpret our behavior. " 

Fleming explained that the fra-

ternity, which was founded in 
1906 and has included such prom-
inent people as Martin Luther 
King, has a history ofhazing. 

"Because we a ren't recognized 
by the IFC, people often say that 
we aren't a ' real' fraternity," 
Fleming said . "You can't judge 
someone by the exterior. We are 
just as much of a student organi-

zation as any other on-campus 
group." 

Aside from their hazing tech-
niques, Alpha Phi Alpha is ju t 
likeany other fraternity. They look 
for people who are motivated and 
who have leader hip potential.

A sian A wareness Week 
Promotes Understanding 

By JULIE MUN RO 
Features Editor 

Studen ts m ay have tasted some unusual food this 
week, or seen a show of ori-

gami and calligraphy at Revelle 
Plaza. On Saturday evening, a 
Chine e C hoir, a karate demon-
stration a nd six other displays of 
fine art will represent an array of 
Asia n cultures . 

These events and activities are 
part of Asian Awareness Week, 
Jan 23-28. According to the pres-
ident of the Vietnamese Student 
Association (VSA), Anthony 
Quan Le, the purpose of this 
" invitation to explore and exper-
ience Asian culture" is to attract 
attention and , subseq uently, pro-
mote interaction and communica-
tion, between t he mem bers of the 
II organizations involved and the 
rest 01 the student body. 

Arnie Hernandez works on a piece of oragami at the Cultural Fair on 
Revelle Plaza, a part of Asian Awareness Week. 

"There is an unwiilingness to 
communicate, and no one is to 
blame, We have school. We have 
our work. There's so many things 
to do. It's no one's fau lt," Le said _ 

"This school's diversity is a lways 
growing and there's a lways going 
to be tension . . . there's academic 
compet it ion. T here's social com-
petition," Le fu rt her ex plai ned. 

In organ izing t he events of t he 
week, he said, "Our la rge-scope 
purpose is to alleviate, mend and 

hopefully prevent any misunder-
sta nding o r misconceptions a bout 
Asia n people." 

"As a Vietna mese, when you 
come into a different society, a 
d ifferent culture ... you feel aio ne. 
You long fo r si milarities a nd 
reminders of home ... the first 
thing you turn to is your own 
people," explained Le, adding that 
most VSA members were bo rn in

The Hall oj Myths: What's Wrong 
With a UCSD Football Team? 

Tritons Overpower Princeton 
(Editor 's Note: This is the first part of this commentary. tire 
second parI of which will be run in an upcoming issue of the 
Guardian) 
By DA VI 0 POnCHA 
Staff Writer 

We've all been there, we've all seen the commercials, and we all 
know that the Halls of Medicine are reall the Halls of Myth. 
Unfortunately, UCSD has its own hall of myth, and people are 
grabbing at the myths ju t like the poor fools who believe that 
Hall's are really cough drop that work and that "the bus will get 
you there." One major myth floating around thi school is that a 
football team doesn't belong here. 

For whatever reason, UCSD students last year decided not 
to begin a football program, and incoming freshmen (oops, I 
mean freshpeople, or do I?) ha ve to live with that decision . Now 
of course, when mo t 01 us were searching for schools, football 
teams were not top requirements on our lists (ot herwise UCSD 
would have an enrollment of about 10(0). However, spending 
a quarter here has made one fact painfully clear: this school 
needs a football team . Why, you say? I'll explain by attacking 
some commonly held mi conceptions. 

There are people who believe that intramurals will be hurt by 
the creation of a foot ball team. Thi tatement can be attacked 
in two ways . One way of looking at the statement is that the 
"nasty administrat ion" is going to shuffle funds away from 1M 
sports and other important area into the football program. 
Truth : Last year' referendum asked the students to pay an 
additional $15.00 per quarter for athletic fees - $10.00 of 
which would go toward the building and maintenance of a 
football team. The $5.00 would go toward a general upgrade of 
all of our intercollegiate teams . Currently, UC D i way below 
the national average a far as money spcnt on athletics , and this 
referendum would have made us fina ncially competitive with 
most Division III chools . As a matter of fact, not on ly would 
the re fe rendum as written have created a football team, but it 
would have helped all of our intercollegiate and club sports a

Cuntributing Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team know it can beat any eastern 
team with ease. So far, the men's 
volleyball team can make that 
same assertion. 

Tuesday night , t he Tritons 
walked away with a relat ively 
easy win over the Princeton Tigers 
(1-1) that should help boost their 
morale after a four game losing 
treak . Win ning in four games 

( 15-5, 14-16, 15-9, 15-3), the 
Tritons (1-4) were a ble to show-
case all their talent, as Head Coach 
Oscar "Digger" Graybill allowed 
all of hi pla yers to perform. 

Neverthel ess, afler breezi ng 
through the fi r t game in which 
UCSD hammered away spike 
after spike (incl Uding one from 
John Lim into the face of Tiger 
setter Marin Gjaja) , Graybill' 
decision almost backfired . In the 
econd game, with only two 
tarters in for the Tritons , Prince-

ton jumped out to an early 4-0 
lead which included an ace from 
the only California native and 
tar hitter for the Tiger team, 

John Phelps. Without batting an 
eye, Graybill never sub tituted his 
sta rters back in and the Tritons 
proceeded to fall by a 14-16 score. 

"1 felt confident with the team I 
had on the court," Graybill men-
tioned after the game. "As long as 
it says UCSD on their shi rts, my 
players should be capable of per-

against any team we play." 

Princeton ' once again scored 
first at the outset of the third 
game, but within minutes the 
Tritons, with all but one of their 
starters back in, found themselves 
dominating. After an outstanding 
block by Jeff Babcock, a powerful 
slam by Nate Brown, and then 
five staight service poi nts by 
Babcock, the Triton were leading 
9-3 and had forced a Tiger 
timeout. The game was sealed 
with an aggressive slam by Nick 
Rothman followed by a winning 
se rve by freshperson Bryan 
Palmer. 

The Tritons emerged with 
authority in the fourth and final 
game, winning the fIrst four points 
including one from an ace by 
sophomore Tom McCutchen. 
Minutes later, with the score 4-2, 
UCSD rattled off eight straight 
points on the heels of anot her ace 
by Bryan Palmer and a deva-
stating slam by Jerry Goldstein. 
Princeton Head Coach Glenn 
Nelson called a timeout in an 
effort to regroup his team, but it 
was to no avail. 

The Tigers showed a brief 
comeback with a ideout and one 
point , but th e Tritons soo n 
regained co ntrol and after two 
kills , the game was well in hand . 
After a brief rally, Goldstein came 
through once more with an 
impressive block, and the Tritons

were in the win column for the 
first time this season. 

Nelson admitted afterward that 
he was disappointed and "thought 
overall [the Tiger] played a lousy 
game," but that they will win their 
division anyway.

UCSD Athletic Director Judy Sweet 
Elected to No. Two NCAA Post 

Judith M. Sweet, Director 
of Athletics at UCSD, has been 
elected secretary-treasurer of 
the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association , becoming the 
first woman to hold the organ-
ization's second highest post. 

.The two-year position is 
second only to president ofthe 
NCAA, and four of the last 
five secretary-treasurers have 
gone on to become president. 

The NCAA is the governing 
body for most of the nation's 
intercollegia te athletic pro-
grams . 

"I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to continue my 
association with the NCAA," 
said Sweet, who was vice-
preside nt for Division II I 
schools from 1986-88. "I feel 
that significant progress has 
been made in more open com-
munication between the NCAA 

office, the NCAA council and 
the membership. One of my 
goals will be to continue to 
enhance that communication 
in a way that collectively we 
can make decisions that will be 
positive for the future of inter-
collegiate athletics on all cam-
puses. " 

Sweet said that being named 
the first female to the position 
"is just a matter of timing. But, 
the important thing is that I'm 
not the last." 

She was elected by a vote of 
the approximately 900 NCAA 
member institutions and con-
ference during their national 
meeting in San Francisco ear-
lier this month. 

Sweet has been at UCSD 
since 1973 and gained national 
prominence when s he was 
named the fir t female athletic 
director of a combined men's 
and women's progam in 1975.

Myths 
Continued from pllge 8 
well. Futhermore, as the popula-
tion of this school grew, and as 
the team beca me es tab li shed, less 
and less money would go towards 
football. Thus, the school would 
not be taking any money away 
from anywhere and givi ng it to 
football. Rather, the students 
would pay for the whole thing, 
and at the same time would be 
helping all the other sports. 

Not only would the money do 
good things, but it would not 
cramp student budgets. Let's face 
it: $ 15,000 per quarter is not a lot 
to ask - students just might have 
to sacrifice one night in 'T J' each 

quarter. Also , con ider that most 
UC D st udents' tuitions are fund-
ed by their parents. 

Other peop le think that a 
football team would stea l all of 
the bes t intramural flag foot ball 
players and conseq uently leave 
the league in a state of di sarray. 
First of all , if a ll the be t players 
left , more intermediate and 
beginning players would join, and 
then U(,SD co uld experience 
what Pete Rozelle so fondly calls 
"parity." Furthermore, there are 
few interCOllegiate quality foot-
ball players at this sc hool any-
way (why would they be here?), 
and the new coach would not be 
able to build his team solely from 
the intramural squads. Of course, 

SPORTS 
the coach could snag a few play-
ers here and there, but the odds 
are that he would build most of 
the team through recruiting. 

The worst excuse for not hav-
ing a team that I have hea rd is 
that starting a football program 
would lower our academic stan-
dard and that UCS D would 
start acce pting dumb jocks just 
so our tea m could win . Rah Rah 
Tritons! Sis Boom Ba h! Let's 
got here and the program bega n 
demic hierarchy at UCSD is most 
likely not going to allow a drop 
in admissions standards, period, 
and if they did , we would never 
know! Quite obviously, UCSD 
will not have a football team 
that could compete with UCLA,

Babcock mentioned that their

somewhat light, but that starting 
in the spring they will be compet-
ing more on their ow n level. In a 
closing note he warned, "Look 
for some upsets from us this year."

but then again, nei th er can most 
of our other ports tea m (except 
a few that no one ever goes to 
wa tc h play), so who care'! The 
first few yea rs would be a bit 
rough, btlt once a few recruits 
got here and the program began 
to build , we'd most likely have a 
successful team such as our men's 
socce r, water polo , and tenni s 
team , or the women's volley-
ball, soccer and tennis teams. I 
do not understand why people 
naturally assume football play-
ers bring academic level down. 
After all, there a re anum ber of 
Division III schools that have 
football programs and are still 
excellent schools, such as Occid -
ental and Emory_

ueSD SUPERSTARS 
Competition setJor Feb. 2-5 

Yes, last weekend was a super one all right that IS, if you were a 
4ger fan Jerry was super, Joe was 

super. and even the Super Bowl, the AllÂ· 
American misnomer, was aClually super, 
for a change I 

But now that all 01 thiS super stuff IS over 
lor another year don't you think It'S abOut 
time to take a super break from all thiS 
madness, and let everyone chili out lor a 
while? 

Heck nol There's stili one more super 
event left on th iS year's calendar and we 
haven't even hI! February yet 

Yep, you guessed It I The UCSO Super. 
sta rs IS lust around the corner (next 
Thursday, Feb 2-5 to be exact) and It 
promises lor the 14th consecutive year to 
challenge the socks off the athlellc elite 01 
our qUiet but growing little campus 

For the uninitiated, the UCSD Super-
stars AII -Spons Competition IS a lour -day, 
1 O-event alfalr 10 a variety 01 sports sk ills 
and activities, palterned a little after the 
Superstars event that you see on TV, but 
even a little more after the Decathlon 
event that you see every four years In the 
OlympICS 

We all know that Willie Gault IS the best 
all-around profeSSional athlete and that 
Bruce Jenner and Daley Thompson are 
the best all -arounders In the decathlon 
event, but th iS year 's unanswered ques-
tion IS .. who Will reign supremeoverthe 
always compet itive UCSD Superstars 
event? 

Last year's event was so competitive 
that the ever-challenging point table took a 
gigantic beating 1988 Superstars king 
Doug Roche blasted the schOOl record 
With an awesome 6370 POint mark, but 
had plenty 01 company at the top. 1987 
champ JJ Fisher Improved on hiS prevIous 
year's mark With a 6420 total, but stili fin -
Ished a distant second ChriS LaRosa 
cracked the 6000 point barner With a line 
6029, and newcomer Linda Ross climbed 
all over the womens ali-time record With a 
sterling 5903 output. 

All In all. 1 6 perlormers went over 5000 
pOints and another SIX eclipsed 4600 So 
what? you say Well, hey. 4500 pOints 
10 thiS baby IS not all that easyl You've got 
to try It, Ilrst 

Men 's Favorite J.J. Fisher 

In four days, you've got 10 run a 60-yard 
dash, bench press a maximum 11ft , throw a 
softball lor distance and accuracy, bowl 
two games. sWim a 50-yard Ireestyle 
Sprint, hit a softball for distance, lake two 
one-mmute time tnals in a basketball 
shooting event. high jump. and finish up 
With a one mile run . in addition to going 
to class, ptaying other Intramural sports, 
working at your Job, and havmg a liu le 
social lime In the evenings, 

Yes, It's qUite an armful, but plenty of 
you try It every year and come away 
rewarded and self-fullilled And don'l think 
lor a minute that you have to be a great 
athlete to enter. Wrongllt IS actually those 
that are pretty consistent that seem to fin-
Ish the best. 

Sign-ups lor thiS year's Superstars event 
Will take place beginning this Thursday 
afternoon (Jan 26) at Canyon view Rec-
reation Offices and continue through the 
weekend Most events are scheduled In 
the afternoon, except Saturdays, which 
are held In the mCirning. 

The competition is open to individuals 
(who compete in 10 events) or teams (01 
5) who compete In their chOice of to out 01 
12 events OffiCials Superstars rules and 
record paCkages are available at Canyon-
view when you sign up, complete With a list

The 
by patty jettie 

hiatus writer ~St ba nds in the music business have 
one goal: to become commrrctally successrul. 

The Pulltoys, however, are too busy having run to 
be serious. 

"It 's hard to keep a serious atti tude about the music 
business when you get the door slammed in your 
face ," drummer Walter Bilts said in a recent interview. 
"The typical altitude is, 'Aw, we haven't heard of you 
before .. . get out of here.' Especially in Los Angeles 
where everyone wants mimics of the big bands. 

"You have 10 bugh at it , because it's these same 
people that end up call ing you back la ter to play at 
thet r clubs." 

Bi tts and bassitisinger Ti m Blankenship began 
playing in high school where they rormed va rious 
garage roek bands. In 1987 the duo placed an ad m 
the Reader in hope of adding a guitari t and com-
pleting the trio. 

"We had these auditions where guit<lrlsts 11\,uld 
come on over and jam on II few Clwer;." Bitts 
expl.1ined "All the e heavy met.11 guit.lrist~ kept 
sh0wtng up and III.' kit uncomfortahle he Â·.lUse we 
didn't Wllnt to say. 'Well . ),ou kno\\' , th iS isn 't going I() 
\l'nrk out .'

Keep Their Heads 
I were really frustrated when he ca me over 

"The first song we played. we asked , 'Do you know 
any xr and he said. 'Yeah, I love XI' So we started 
playing "Hungry Wolf," and it sounded so good. 
It was almost like finding a th ird one of our elves 
becausc we were into the same exact musi ." 

From playi ng acoustic sets at parties. they pro-
gressed to performing a[ such venues as the Whistle 
Stop, the Spirit Club, and North Park's tiny 258 1 club. 

Although currently not on a label. the band is in the 
process of sending out promotional packages and 
copies of their video. "The Washington World ." Yet 
even this srep is a light-hearted one, reOeeting both 
the members' casual per anali ties and theirdetertntna-
tion ro aVOid rushtng into the pitfall of ovcrlllght 
success. 

"I guess IVO: could get on a label if we wanted to, i~ 
jusr depend s on which one," Bitts said. "We want 10 
go tndependent because if we were ever to get on a 
major label we wouldn't be abk to do what we lI'antlO 
do. I rhlllk Independents give you it 1m of room 10 
grow and move ,tnd experime nt. 

" I think the rm~or labels Jre only tnterested tn 
making money, and If you're not m.lkinga m,lrkctable

"The tape come off sou nding how we sound live ," 
Bilts explained . "We like having ultimate creative 
control over our music . It's rcally hard to have 
someone else engineer I the tape l for you, becau c 
they have an Idea of what they wam you to sound like. 
And you're trying to tell them. 'we wam this kind of 
sound.' cott did most of the production ... " 

When a ked to describe the band's Style . Bilts 
demurred, claiming that the music i open to 
interpretation 

"When people a k what we sound like I tell them to 
come hea r us pia>' and then let them decide. I hate to 
pigeon hole our Style. It's not JUSt punk orjustcoltntry 
western, it's a whole bunch of stufr." 

The self-e ntitled tape , which ca n be found at Off

A blast of reality is what we 
get from the new Violent 
Femmes album, 3, on Warner 
Bros. The reality is that bands 
who get fast fame get fast 
burnout. 

According to Gordon Gano, 
the band's songwriter and lead 
vocalistl guitarist, "The fast, 
quick ideas seem to be so right 
on the mark in expressing the 
songs I write, and that's some-
thing I wanted to catch in the 
studio." 

Apparently the Violent 
Femmes went straight into the 
studio without much rehearsal, 
no overdubs, a minimum of 
session accompaniment, and 
bare bones production. They 
wanted to get as close to their 
live sound as possible. Perhaps 
they were just feeling lazy. 
Anyway, the result is a tired, 
rough, and uninspired group of 
songs. To be blunt. 3 is pretty 
boring. 

The obvious exception to 
the dullness is the opening 
track, "Nightmares," which is 
already quite a hit with 91X. 

This song is very catchy, and is 
even faintly reminisce nt of the 
Violent Femmes we used to 
know and love. It seems the 
band has cleverly created a very 
commercial, clean sound in one 
song, in hopes of making some 
money off the album. 

"Nigh tmares," however, 
does not make up for the rest 
of the album. The only other 
bright spots are a great chorus 
in "World We're Living In," 
and guest saxophonist Peter 
Basestrieri. Also interesting is 
the bluegrass flavor of "Lies." 

All in all, the album is a big 
disappointment in comparison 
with the Violent Femmes' ear-
lier sound. Their now-legendary 
debut album was loaded with 
vibrant, danceable tracks. Hal-
lowed Ground, number two, 
displayed a poignant, spittual 
side of the band. From there it's 
been downhill, The Blind Lead-
ing the Naked had just a few 
good tracks, and we all know 
how I feel about 3. (Inciden-
tally, the tide refers to the 
number of members in the 
band. How poetic!) 

Few bands have accomplished 
what Dreams So Real has with 
their major-label debut, Rough 
Night In }eTicho. 

This talented trio has produced 
a creative exploration of straight-
ahead " American rock," joining 
R.E.M. and the B-5Zs in attracting 
attention to their hometown of 
Athens, GA. An otherwise sleepy 
southern college town, Athens has, 
according to drummer Drew 
Worsham, "a naive approach to 
albums." 

Even so, Athens is the place to 
be if you have a band and want to 
get noticed . "The atmosphere is 
fertile for bands," says Barry 
Marler, lead singer, guitarist and 
principal songwriter. "But I think 
it gets more attention than it 
deserves." 

by donovan p. roche 
hiatus writer 

Athe ns' Cham ber of Commerce 
understandably disagrees. "In this 
community," the brochure from 
the Welcome Center reads, 
..... you'll find that [heritage 
blends] with a vibrant, contem-
pororary style." 

It may sound like the o~ning 
line to every ci ty's welcome, but it 
does accurately describe Dreams 
So Real 's approach to music. 

"We make use of classic late-
sixties styles as a foundation for 
what we do and then filter it 
through our modern experience," 
Marler says. 

This combination of old and 
new is immediately noticeable in 
"Melanie," a gutsy love song that 
has an opening guitar riff reminis-
cent of Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't 

Going,

Fear The Reaper." 

Luckily, the band doesn't get 
carried away with such flashes of 
the past. "We wete definitelv 
inspired by that song, but we go off 
on our own after that," Marler 
says. "We don't want to be a re-
statement of people's past success-
es." 

And theyaren't. 
It is this consideration that 

allows Dreams So Real to estab-
lish a name for themselves. They 
are able to create a sense of famil-
iarity and still have a style and an 
energy all their own. 

One extension of this is Marler's 
impressive songwriting - evi-
dently a reflection of his growing

Real theater in an Diego? You 
better believe it. The Gaslamp 
Quarter Theater ompanyopened 
eason '89 on Jan. 18, with I'm 

Nnt Rappaport, a poignant, 
witty 10 k into the ollective 
reality of two very different old, 
men, and the changing w rid theyl 

, are forced to confro nt. 
I 'm Not Ra ppaport is th e 

, story of a modern,day Don Quix, 
ote and hi reluctant San ho Panza. 
Nat, an e ighty, year-old Jewish 
worker, refuses to be the victim of 
age. 

He constantly assumes character 

about t g c - p. 
Although a bit he itant at fir t , 

Midge be m e drawn into Nat's 
'bordering-on -crazy ' vision of 
freedom. He even gets up to ing 
with Nat, and performs the traight 

man in I 'm Not Rappaport, a 
favorite skit of one-time vaude-
ville great, Willie Howard . 

T ogether, Nat and Midge form 
a sort of peanut gallery o n today's 
world, commenting simultaneous-
ly with the objectivity of distant 
outsiders, and the desperation of 
misfits longing to belong. 

Nat and Midge share with us 
the perspective of age. In some of 
the play's more touching moments 
they explore nostalgia, and their 

played by Don Alan Croll, and 
Midge by Lance Robert , both of 
whose credits include many o n 
and off Broadway productions, 
and televi ion. 

The t , which does not hange 
throughout the play, is we ll 
designed, with falling leaves at dif-
ferent times during the acts, which 
relate a areful attention to detail 
and aesthetics. 

I'm Not Rappaport will play 
through Feb . 26 at the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan Theater, reserva-
tions may be made by the Gas-
lamp Quarter Theater box office 
at 234-9583. 

This play, which is the first of 
many to be shown at the theater 

Don Croll and Lance Robert discuss life in the park in I'm Not Rappaport.

roles whi h , when infused with 
the energy of fantasy, carry him 
away fro m his real-life situation: 
that of a di advantaged enior 
ci tizen, o r 'society's invisible.' 

By taking on this repertoire of 
varying personas Nat respollds to 
'overbearing figures of authority' 
everywhere. He ha a talent for 
mischief which makes him an 
endearing hero, even though his 
con tant wise cracking cannot hide 
his plaintive, almost ' thought-
tortured' quality. Nat, however, 
refuses to give up. He shares this 
elf,fabrica ted world of unlimited 

possibility with Midge, the occu' 
pant of the same bench in Central 
Park .

sense of loss remembering life-
han e not taken. Life, they 

remind us , rea lly does not go on 
forever. 

Even though I'm Not Rappaport 
confronts the unavoidable truth 
about aging, it offers hope. 
The play's well-timed humor 
injects some levity into this pain-
ful, often frightening subject. 

It ridicules the over,importance 
of everything, and delights in its 
own silliness. Who wouldn't laugh 
at two crotchety old geezers get-
ting high with government sanc-
tioned grass for their glaucoma? 

Who wouldn't chuckle a bit as 
they systematically destroy some 
overenthusiastic yuppie jogger, 
who has come to tell Midge he is 
out of a job? 

Both the role of Nat and of 
Midge are superbly cast: Nat being
