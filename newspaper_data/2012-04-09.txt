SURF REPORT

BY ZEV HURWITZ 
Associate News Editor

California public universities will 
not re-institute affirmative action, a 
three-judge panel of the 9th court of 
appeals ruled Tuesday, April 3. 

Judges have dismissed Coalition 
to Defend Affirmative Action vs. 
American Civil Rights Institute, a 

lawsuit filed by 46 minority students 
and the CDAA. The lawsuit sought 
to overturn Proposition 209, 
California’s 1996 ballot initiative 
that prohibits race being used as a 
factor for consideration in university 
admissions. The affirmative action 
ban has been upheld several times 
since appeals began in 1997.

The judge panel heard arguments 
on Feb. 13, during which California 
Gov. Jerry Brown testified on behalf 
of the plaintiffs, saying that Prop. 
209 was an obstacle for minority 
students. 

The American Civil Rights 
Institute, which was founded by former 

UC Regent Ward Connerly, applauded 
the decision to uphold the ban.

“[This is] good news for everyone 
who values fairness and equal 
opportunity,” ACRI lawyer Ralph 
Kasarda said in the San Francisco 
Chronicle.

In recent years, the percentage of 
Caucasian students at UC campuses 
has dropped nearly 5 percent while 
enrollment numbers for Hispanic 
and African American students have 
increased. UC admissions data is not 
yet available for 2012.

Renowned professor Halbert L. 
White, who was shortlisted for the 
2011 Nobel Prize in Economics, 
passed away March 31 after a four-
year battle against cancer. White 
—  who was Chancellor’s Associate 
Distinguished Professor of Economics 
in the Division of Social Sciences 
— was best known for developing the 
White standards error test in 1980. To 
this day, the White test is used to check 
built-in assumptions and procedures 
of economic models and is often used 
in software programs that perform 
regression analysis. 

“Hal’s 30-plus years of service 
to this campus helped propel our 
economics department to the top-
ranked powerhouse it is today,” 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox wrote in 
a press release.

White was born in Kansas City, Mo. 
on November 19, 1950. He graduated 

top of his class from Princeton 
University in 1972 with a degree in 
economics, then went on to earn his 
Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology in 1976. After serving as 
a faculty member at the University of 
Rochester for three years, White came 
to UCSD in 1979.

In 1999, White co-founded Bates 
and White Economic Consulting, 
a firm that works with works with 
advanced financial, economic and 
econometric analysis and now employs 
more than 150 people in Washington 
D.C. and San Diego.

White is survived by his wife 
Teresa B. White, children Rich Heath 
West and Rachel Heath and sisters 
Celeste White, Catherine White and 
Lynda Lanker. Funeral services will be 
private, but there are plans for public 
memorial tributes at UCSD and in 
Washington, D.C.

OBITURIES

STUDY: UC EDUCATION 
IS TOO LEFTIST 

Group publishes report claiming that moving toward social science 
curriculum leads to unbalanced education.

By NATALIE COVATE • Staff Writer

UC SYSTEM

The University of California provides unbalanced education to its students, 
according to a report released by 
the California Association of Scholars 
on April 1. The study cited faculty 
statistics — such as the concentration 
of 81 liberal faculty members to two 
conservative faculty members within 
the political science departments of 
the UC campuses — to claim that the 
University of California is leftist.

The study claims to examine 
the causes and consequences of the 
growth of leftism in the University 
of California system by looking at 
factors such as the number of leftist 
faculty members and the curriculum 

of classes. The report claims that 
courses offered throughout the UC 
system — such as five UC Santa Cruz 
classes dedicated to Karl Marx — 
promote radical activism.  

According to the report, UCSD’s 
political science faculty member 
ratio stands at 27 Democrats to 
zero Republicans. It also states that 
UCSD’s history department shows 
26:1  Democrat-to-Republican ratio.

Public Education Coalition 
member and March 1 protest leader 
Kevin Quirolo said that he does 
not find these numbers shocking. 
Quirolo, who was involved in 
organizing “Radical Rush Week,” said 
that although faculty may be leftist, 

the UCSD student body is not leftist 
enough.

“One thing I would note is that 
the more education you have above 
undergraduate, the more left-wing 
you tend to be,” he said. “If the 
curriculum and professors are very 
leftist, it doesn’t seem to be picking 
up among the students because it is 
challenging to get students involved 
in activism.”

According to the study, UC 
graduates are unprepared for the 
workplace, study an average of less 
than 12 hours a week and have poor 
civic knowledge and basic skills. For

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 9,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

example, in a survey conducted by 
the American Council of Trustees 
and Alumni, 81 percent of seniors 
received a grade of ‘D’ or ‘F’ on basic 
American history questions.

The study claims that politicization 
is directly responsible for the decline in 
the quality of graduates. The rationale 
is that students increasingly take 
social science (i.e. political science, 
sociology) courses instead of classics 
and humanities classes. Since students 
in these departments are assigned 
more journal-style articles to read, as 
opposed to classical political theory 
works, they are not challenged by 
texts that develop important critical 
thinking skills.  

According to 
e d u c a t i o n - f o c u s e d 
website Minding the 
Campus, the report stated 
that UCSD students 
had complained about 
the freshmen writing 
sequence and professors 
who spoke disparagingly 
about “contemporary 
American imperialism” 
and “Western fascism.”

Public Education 
Coalition member Sean 
Estelle said that the 
quality of education may 
be declining throughout 
the UC system, but 
increased politicization is 
not to blame.

“Our education is 
suffering, but it’s not 
suffering because of 
a leftist bias in the UC 
but because [the UC Regents] aren’t 
thinking about where their funding is 
going,” he said. “[When] the Regents 
and administrators are getting their 
bonuses and the schools are closing 
libraries, the quality of education is 
going to suffer.”

The study claims there are a 
growing percentage of liberal faculty 

members, although it does not show 
a specific time frame for comparison. 
Additionally, it states that the more 
a field relies on politics, the higher 
the concentration of liberal faculty 
members are likely to work in that 
field.

“In some areas, [leftism] is so 
extreme that it amounts to virtual 
exclusion of any but left-of-center 
faculty,” the report states.

The report also claims that the type 
of leftism seen in faculty members has 
become more extreme since the late 
1960s, possibly as an effect of younger 
faculty members being more solidly 
left-oriented. These findings suggest 
that as younger faculty members 
replace retirees, the imbalance will 
continue to grow.

In addition, 
CAS concludes that 
faculty members are 
becoming more likely 
to admit that political 
activism is one of their 
goals of teaching.

“I don’t think that 
the classes leaning 
to the left are really 
that far to the left, 
and even if they were, 
they aren’t having 
that much influence 
on students,” Quirolo 
said. “I don’t know 
how you would 
enact on [this 
problem] other than 
by encourage more 
conservative-leaning 
people to get involved 
in high-caliber 
academics like the 

university system.”
UC spokesperson Steve Montiel 

said that the UC Office of the President 
disagrees with the findings of the 
report.

“We don’t agree that the University 
[of California] is the monoculture 
portrayed in the report,” Montiel said. 
“Aside from that, the report is from 

the idea that the exchange of diverse 
opinions is necessary for education.”

The UC Academic Senate, a 
body representing faculty in the 
shared governance of the University 
of California, will be conducting a 
review of the study, Montiel said. The 
study has been sent to three different 
committees to analyze the veracity of 
the report’s findings. 

“The most thorough review will 
be by the academic senate and that 
[review] will take some time,” Montiel 
said. “We have confidence that the 
academic senate will give a fair 
assessment of [the study].”

While there is no specific timeline 
for the release of the academic senate’s 
study, it will likely be finished in two 
weeks, Montiel said.

According to Montiel, UCOP 
also considers other similar 
studies conducted periodically by 
professional organizations.

“We do well with those [other 
studies] and our schools and programs 
are among the highest rated in the 
country,” Montiel said. “I think we 
have pretty good quality here.”

CAS is a part of the National 
Association of Scholars, which is a 
network of scholars that analyzes 
and publishes a quarterly journal and 
reports, such as this one, evaluating 
higher education policy and 
academic trends. The organization’s 
mission statement claims that it aims 
to stimulate academic improvement.

While the NAS study specifically 
refers to the University of California, 
it also stated that these trends are 
occurring at institutions of higher 
education across the country, 
including technical institutions and 
community colleges.

2012-13 A.S. COUNCIL

ENDORSEMENTS

Each year, when the Editorial Board begins debating presidential endorsements, we run into the same problem. It’s no secret that the fee-fighting, sustainability-
focused, SAAC-affiliated Student Voice slate usually 
mirrors this board’s political ideology — but every 
April we find ourselves interviewing candidates 
with lots of heart, but not 
lots of experience, and many 
passionate ideas, but little 
know-how.

This year, things are 
different. We have endorsed 
Elizabeth Garcia for 2012-13 
A.S. President because she 
is the sole candidate with 
the progressive values we’re 
looking for, a two-year track 
record of A.S. knowledge 
and direct insight into the 
position she is running for. 

Predictably, Garcia is a 
member of the SAAC and progressive communities. 
She’s involved with Chicano/a group MEChA (and 
endured grief over it after being attacked as a racist 
on her Facebook event pages), attended quarterly 
Campus Climate Meetings and worked with issues 
involving the privatization of the UC system.

Her platform is politically focused — she 
hopes to collaborate with the Student Organized 
Voter Access Committee to bring a presidential 
candidate to campus, create an initially unfunded 
Associate Vice President of Sustainability to focus 
on issues of environment and social justice, lobby 
for more student representation on transportation 
committees and revise election bylaws to increase 
the 20-percent voter turnout necessary to pass a 
student fee referendum. 

In short, Garcia politics mirror that of 
the typical Student Voice candidate, but her 
background and experience in council set her 
apart. As the sitting Muir Senator, Garcia has the 
name recognition and direct council experience 
that candidates such as TIDE candidate and 
sitting Marshall College Council chair Meggie 
Le and Innovate candidate Ali Athar lack. Le is a 

strong candidate as well: Her platform’s focus on 
transportation and parking issue are admirable, 
and her slate strikes a good mix between strong 
ideology and strong experience. But her focus on 
integrating with college councils is better utilized 
in TIDE’s many excellent campuswide senatorial 
candidates, and largely negligible for the transfer 

and off-campus communities. 
And while Athar’s 

entrepreneurial ideas (biofuels, 
bike-sharing and research) 
are a breath of fresh air that 
could have great benefits for 
UCSD, his highly specialized 
politics make him a better fit 
for the AVP of Enterprises 
position, while his lack of prior 
experience in council would 
create a steep learning curve that 
would hinder the effectiveness 
of his term. 

Current campuswide senator 
Karen Liang will undoubtedly, and rightly, garner a 
large proportion of votes as the face of the student 
life and spirit-focused “bold.” slate. Her history 
as Roosevelt Senator and Senate Chair and years 
on council give her the experience necessary to 
carry through her visibility- and spirit-focused 
initiatives with the same effectiveness that current 
A.S. President Alyssa Wing has shown. But while 
this board was impressed with her experience 
— and endorsed several candidates who shared her 
views and will work for increased visibility, Greek 
initiatives and better athletic relations — we believe 
it is more important for the university’s figurehead 
to be dedicated to political activism.  

After a failed campuswide senatorial bid in 
2010, Garcia became the Chief of Staff and right-
hand woman for  2010-11 A.S. President Wafa Ben 
Hassine during a now infamously contentious year. 
This has heavily influenced her conduct this year,  
and emphasis on building rapport and eschewing 
slate politics. Garcia’s been through the worst, so 
with a strong, multi-slate council behind her, she’s 
ready to try to lead us to a more politically active, 
more effective year.  

PRESIDENT

ELIZABETH GARCIA STUDENT VOICE

It’s immediately noticeable that Cody Marshall is running for Vice President of Student Life as an independent. According to Marshall, his decision to 
go slate-less lies in the nature of the position — as VP of 
Student Life he must bridge the slate divides and run a 
unified council — logic which makes him an appealing 
candidate, though it also might give him less power when 
it comes to campaigning. Regardless, Marshall has the 
clearest vision and most concrete goals when it comes 
to running the three distinct segments of his office — 
athletics, diversity and concerts and events.

His stance on diversity is refreshing, with the 

Sixth College senator advocating for more education 
and a critical look at the meaning of diversity 
instead of programs that are simply “watered down 
multiculturalism” (i.e. foreign film nights and special 
dining hall menus). 

He’s largely focused on athletics as well; though an 
initial supporter of the D-I referendum, Marshall was 
prominent in running informative campaigns for both the 
pro and con sides. In the wake of the referendum’s failure, 
Marshall has a clear focus on supporting our current 
teams by pursuing televising sporting events through a 
collaboration with Triton Television. 

Marshall won’t mess with any of our current concert 
traditions, but rather build new traditions that focus 
on more specific communities across campus, such as 
transfer students and the student-run spaces of the Old 
Student Center. 

While the other candidates — Bold’s Clinton 
Rodriguez and TIDE’s Jeremy Akiyama — have great 
ideas of their own (Rodriguez has a focus on Greek 
housing and Akiyama envisions a student life office which 
intersects with the external office), their lack of specificity

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 9,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Currently keeping 
a seat warm in the A.S. 
Senate, Bold candidate 
Brad Segal hopes to 
continue his position as 
Campuswide Senator. As a 
former fraternity president and campus 
director of the UC Haiti Initiative, Segal 
has a passion for funding more non-
traditional philanthropic events. He sees 
an opportunity for Greek housing on 
campus with the new chancellor, a move 
that many have been interested in and 

could be a focal goal for Housing, Dining and Hospitality. Segal has 
leadership credentials coming out of his ears, leading us to suspect 
that he will be a driving force in the Senate next year.  

With three years of council experience, current Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Pauline Nuth has the back-
ground to know the weaknesses in the A.S. 
budget, the fiscal conservatism to ensure 
that council doesn’t overallocate and the 
know-how to increase efficiency and 
transparency. 

The AVP of Student Orgs  position — a 
key force in working with funding —is a 
logical stepping stone to the VP of Finance 
position.  Over the past year, Nuth has 
worked to publicize the funding sources 

available to student orgs and manage all 
financial requests from student orgs on 
behalf of council. In essence, she has been 
the main liaison between A.S. Council and 
student organizations throughout campus. 

As VP of Finance, Nuth intends to  
reorganize the A.S. funding guidelines 
to clearly articulate the financial process 
to orgs, and create a streamlined online 
process for funding appeals. Aside from 
this specialized knowledge, Nuth’s previ-
ous work as ERC senator ensures that she 
understands legislation and the rules of 
council as well.

When we handed Nuth a copy of last 
year’s budget and asked her to critique it, 
she immediately whipped out a pen and 
started bracketing line items and offices that 
she felt were due for reevaluation. Her main 
assessment: more frugality with college pro-
gramming and more money to the external 
office and SOVAC in particular. With both 
the specialized and general knowledge to 
accomplish her goals, and the institutional 
knowledge to avoid repeating the mistakes 
of her predecessors,  Nuth is the best choice 
for VP of Finance. 

VICE PRESIDENT OF 
FINANCE AND RESOURCES

PAULINE NUTH BOLD
RESPONSIBILITIES
• Advises president and council on all 
fiscal issues
• Oversees activity-fee distribution
SALARY & BENEFITS

WHY WE ENDORSE HER
This AVP of Student Organizations has 
practical experience and new ideas.

VICE PRESIDENT OF 
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

OLAMIDE NOAH
TIDE

After a year marked by intense political activism and social movements, Olamide Noah is the best candidate to continue 
the momentum that previous VP External Samer 
Naji has created. While Noah’s background, 
as current Vice Chair of the Black Student 
Union and the Students for Affirmative Action 
Committee, seems very in tune with the ideals of 
Student Voice, Noah stated that she chose TIDE 
to step outside of her comfort zone and act as a 
bridge for different communities.

This stated commitment in connecting groups 
from the Greek community to SAAC and the 
athletes will be effective in institutionalizing 
political engagement as important for every 
student. Further, Noah recognizes that social 
activism can take many different roles and is 
interested in offering various avenues of activism 
for those who may not be comfortable with 
walkouts and protests.  Her plans to work closely 
with the new VP of Student Life to increase 
awareness through student events like Bear 
Gardens and Sun God provide a fresh idea  — 
Noah is fully ready to work with her fellow VPs 
to create a climate comfortable for people who are 
just beginning to be involved in activism.

Noah’s two main goals as VP External are 
to spread awareness about the Fund the UC 
Campaign, especially in regard to promoting 
the middle class scholarship. She also hopes to 
bring greater visibility to the VP External office, 
rebrand the AVP of Local Affairs position and 
increase UCSD’s presence in the greater San 
Diego community. 

Further, Noah’s background as a member 
of the Campus Climate Committee shows that 
she clearly knows how to create bargaining 
power with administration. She plans to increase 
accountability by building coalitions, meeting 
frequently with admin and emphasizing the 
importance of institutional memory for orgs. 

Noah’s multi-faceted background, willingness 
to communicate with her divided constituents 
and solid plans makes her the best candidate to 
tackle the job of VP External on next year’s A.S. 
Council. 

RESPONSIBILITIES
• Educates student body on issues affecting 
UCSD at city, state and national levels
• Lobbies officials and legislators on behalf 
of student body
• Serves at UC Student Association rep for 
UCSD 
SALARY & BENEFITS
• $5,250 per year
• A-spot parking upgrade
WHY WE ENDORSE HER
Noah is the most likely to bridge divided 
campus communities.

EDITORIAL BOARD

CAMPUSWIDE SENATORS

BRAD 
SEGAL

TIDE candidate Savini Ganehwa has 
a proven history of political engagement. 
She sits on Sixth College Council, is a 
core member of the voter registration 
SOVAC group and involved with MEChA 
and SAAC, but also focused on sharing 
her politically active goals with the 
campus at large. Ganehwa wants to start 
an inter-college communication program 
to focus on the intersection between 
different orgs and reduce the alienation 
between student groups. She’s invested in 
the hot-button issues, but more interested 

in running informative campaigns than blindly championing one 
side to her constituents. With her political background and focus on 
outreach, Ganehwa can be truly effective on a campuswide level. 

Current ERC Senator and TIDE 
candidate Jackie Clavin believes, and 
rightly so, that council can’t govern 
efficiently until it fixes itself. She 
hopes to focus on internal reforms by 
charging a committee to rework the 
convoluted and outdated A.S. bylaws so 
councilmembers truly understand their 
own governing guidelines. 

Clavin’s focus on sticking to 
“precedent” and understanding the 
niceties of the bylaws will lead to a more 
informed, productive council.  

Clavin’s also interested in educating students on the routes to 
obtain funding —  a worthy goal that will help the student orgs 
navigate the world of student fees, money and A.S. Council.

Daniel Miyagi from 
the Bold slate is keen to 
put his extensive financial 
experience toward 
philanthropy. After working 
with the Student Fee 

Advisory Committee, Miyagi understands 
how money works and is interested in 
taking A.S. “visibility” campaigns further 
than Library Walk by communicating 
directly with student orgs in meetings. As 
the VP of Finance for IFC, Miyagi has the 
connections to improve the volunteer fair 
and get the Greek community involved. His optimism in “giving back” 
comes with a plan to create a food box where students leave extra food 
to feed less fortunate students on campus.

Arcelia Gutierrez may lack prior council 
experience, but her involvement in the 
activist community would bring a welcome 
outside perspective to next year’s council.

The Student Voice candidate has 
worked with a number of campaigns, 
including Reclaim UCSD and March 
1, to bring quality education to UCSD 
students. She has actively tried to lobby 
administrators to hold them accountable to 
student demands and knows what works 
and what doesn’t. 

In addition to continuing the student 
protest movement, Gutierrez hopes to push for smaller class sizes 
and more class offerings, two goals that are paramount as budget cuts 
continue to lower the quality of education for undergraduates at UCSD.

A.S. campuswide senators are usually 
eager to hear the issues on the table, and 
eager to avoid picking an area of focus for 
senator projects. TIDE candidate Matthew 
Mayeda has a platform refreshingly focused 
on wellness and student health, along with 
concrete project ideas in a student life 
sector often overlooked. He wants to work 
with the Wellness Resource Center and 
the Zone, lobby for a public health minor 
and publicize SHIP initiatives for students 
who aren’t well-versed in the campus 
bureaucracy of health insurance. Mayeda’s 
specific goals, combined with experience as a Well-Being Cluster 
advisory member , ensure that he has a cause from the moment he 
steps behind the table, and increase his chances for success.

Come April 13, eight candidates will be elected to 
A.S. Council to work on senator projects, vote on 
legislation and generally sacrifice their Wednesday 
nights for the public good. This year, the Guardian 

Editorial Board interviewed 16 candidates and  
listened to ideas about computer apps, sand angels 
and Hogwarts. From these, we chose the eight who 
would bring the most to the 2012-13 A.S. Council.

Bold’s John Weng wants to make sure 
students know about what council can do 
for them. Students may support the idea 
of A.S. Safe Rides, he says, but often fail to 
sign up. To solve this, Weng is interested 
in creating a digitalized kiosk in PC so that 
students can easily swipe their IDs to sign 
up. He hopes to continue his oversight 
of the A.S. newsletter “A.S. of Now,” 
accompanied with a new online student 
forum where students can voice their 
opinions. Weng has worked closely with 
current President Alyssa Wing as the Chief 
of Staff — a position that has required him to live blog all the meetings 
and given him insight about the inner workings of council.

Repping for the skittish freshmen 
everywhere, Irene Chang from TIDE 
slate is all about outreach. In addition 
to her work as community director of 
voter registration org SOVAC, Chang 
is a member of SERC and believes that 
A.S. Council should have a constant 
presence at college events. Chang nods 
to our underexposed humanities majors 
by looking to increase job fairs for social 
sciences and wants to unite the campus 
under Web communities like UCLA’s 
Bruinwalk, which offers discussion of 

topics like professors, dorms and book selling. Chang’s objectives are 
small but feasible, and show her potential as a future leader in council.

A li Athar may be the odd man out — literally — in this year’s A.S. presidential race, but the ideas this 
chemical engineering major brings to the 
table is fresh and, to quote his party’s slate, 
innovative. 

With no previous A.S. experience under 
his belt, the Sixth College senior is this 
year’s obligatory “maverick”; while he’s tried 
to apply for A.S. positions multiple times 
before, he’s never been able to win the bid.  
Athar is an entrepreneur at heart, with 
start-up companies that back up his cam-
paign promises of “honing leadership on 
campus and innovating successful student-
operated businesses.” 

“My campaign is based on entrepre-
neurship and leadership, and I have a lot

E lizabeth Garcia takes pride in her position on the frontlines of student activism since, quite literally, day one.
“My very first day at UC San Diego I 

was out in front of Center Hall protesting 
against fee hikes,” Garcia said. “I remember 
because there was a senator at the time 
who said that he was a part of Associated 
Students. I said ‘I don’t know what that is 
but if he is out here, that sounds like a pretty 
cool job to have.’”

Since her freshman year, the communi-
cations and political science double major 
has created quite the résumé. She’s been 
a member of Chicano/a student group 
MEChA, worked as a tour guide, orienta-
tion leader and resident advisor and cur-
rently serves as Muir College senator.

I n her hometown of Cerritos, California, A.S. presidential candidate Meggie Le lives a whopping 10 minutes from 
Disneyland. This means that, apart from 
growing up a self-proclaimed Disney lover 
(the newer “Tangled” is her favorite), Le 
has owned an annual pass to the park since 
she was a kid.

But here’s some good PR for Thurgood 
Marshall College’s Dimensions of Culture 
program: Thanks to her time at UCSD, 
the TMC third year isn’t all princess sing-
alongs anymore.

“It was really eye-opening to see how 
sheltered I was, especially going through

Cookout],” Le said. “Marshall has definitely

K aren Liang has no interest in law school. The Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior has served on student government 
for three years, quickly rising through the 
ranks to become a frontrunner in this year’s 
election — but despite being surrounded 
by a council of would-be lawyers and bud-
ding politicians, she’d rather become editor 
of Vogue than editor of the Harvard Law 
Review. Her idols are Coco Chanel and 
Marie Antoinette, the former for invent-
ing the modern woman, the latter “for the 
clothes, not the politics.” The daughter of 
a foreign ambassador, her biggest fight 
has been learning to avoid discouraging 
remarks about her chosen field of fashion 
marketing. Liang is the presidential hopeful

IMPERIAL RIVALRIES IN THE THIRD REICH' - 
SOCIAL SCIENCES BLDG (SSB), RM 107
Presenter: Dr. Dirk van Laak, Justus-Liebig-Universitat 
Gieben. Recent research suggests a continuity of 
German colonialism from 1884 to 1945 and from 
Windhuk to Auschwitz. Dr. Van Laak's paper puts into 
question linear continuities like these. Instead, it 
outlines different traditions of German expansionism, 
which since the 19th century rivaled against each other. 
Apart from their different patronage, they also 
represented different approaches to - and different 
methods of - imperialism. The talk will discuss existing 
imperial alternatives and weigh them against each 
other. Part of the Thyssen Lecture Series: The History of 
German Colonialism and Imperialism. Presented by the 
Institute for International, Comparative, and Area Studies

of background in starting up my own 
companies, as well as leading groups 
and incubators,” Athar said. “I feel like 
that background can be specifically 
useful at UCSD.”

Athar first sharpened his business 
instincts in high school — he helped 
start a private business venture with 
the non-profit organization Junior 
Achievement. The company grew 
from its lemonade-stand roots with 
pen sales to slowly become a success-
ful advertising company under Athar’s 
leadership. Eventually, the company, 
which sold discounted tickets to neigh-
borhood haunts, amassed $15,000 to 
$20,000 a year. 

Athar’s early passion for business 
and marketing only followed him to 
UCSD. One of his most successful 
current ventures is a property manage-
ment business, in which he helps place 
students in housing. 

In addition to his full course load 
and business management, Athar 
working with his slate, Innovate, to 
nail down goals such as creating a bike-
sharing program. Athar clearly does 
not dawdle around with vague cam-
paign promises — his idea of offer-
ing microloans of $500 to $1,000 to 
students with personal business plans 
is backed by funding initiatives that 
could only come from someone with 
years of experience. 

“Obviously not every single busi-
ness I’ve started was successful, but I 
do have a lot of background in starting 
up companies, so that’s where I want to 
bring my leadership and entrepreneur-
ship skills to UCSD and to help UCSD 
students become inspired to start their 
own entrepreneurial ventures,” Athar 
said.

Athar’s business plan with a heart of 
gold comes from emulating one of his 
role models, Magic Johnson. Johnson 
is what you would call a “social entre-
preneur,” the rare sort of individual 
who could turn a profit while making 
the streets of South L.A. a better place. 

“Magic Johnson has done it all,” 
Athar said. “He’s an incredible inves-
tor, and he’s making movements both 
socially and business-wise.” 

Athar is nothing if not a student 
at heart. Each of his business ventures 
requires him to pick up a new skill — 
for example, his property management 
business sent him on the path to get-
ting his real estate license. And despite 
his already strenuous course load as an 
engineering major, Athar makes time 
to take classes outside of his discipline, 

During her freshman year she ran 
to be an campuswide senator on what 
was then Students First, and is now the 
Student Voice slate. While she wasn’t 
able to win the bid, she was appointed 
chief of staff for 2010-11 President 
Wafa Ben Hassine, where she learned 
the know-how of the office of the 
president.

Now in her third year, Garcia 
believes that this preparation makes 
her qualified to run for president on 
behalf of the Student Voice slate. With 
her experience, she would hit the 
ground running, Garcia said. 

“I’ve sat in on various committee 
meetings and administrative meetings 
as a proxy for the A.S. president,” she 
said. “I know what it’s like to be in a 
room full of administrators and be the 
only student representative represent-
ing the student voice. That’s something 
I’d bring to the table.”

Garcia’s platform as a member of 
the Student Voice slate aligns with 
the “reclaim” rhetoric that, in Garcia’s 
words, seeks to create a positive stu-
dent experience, especially through 
fighting fee increases and putting pres-
sure on legislation to prioritize UC 
education. She hopes to organize more 
conferences, like the Student Lobby 
Conference that took place late Winter 
Quarter, to directly approach legisla-
tors.

As a current council member, 
Garcia continually sees other ways 
she’d like to influence the way A.S. 
Council runs right at home, including 
an effort to change current legislation 
that dictates that in order for a fee 
increase referendum to pass, 20 per-
cent of the student population must 
vote “yes.” 

“I don’t think that 20 percent of the 
students is very representative, espe-
cially when it comes to increasing fees 
in a time when people are struggling to 
pay for education,” Garcia said. “I want 
to change that number from 20 to 50 
[percent].”

Garcia mixes her ideological values 
regarding higher education with prag-
matic approaches to running coun-

the world actually is. I know now there 
is definitely systematic oppression.”

Unlike many of the other candi-
dates for A.S. office, Le was never 
involved in student government in 
high school and her rise in Marshall 
College Council was a surprising 
development.

“The decision to run for A.S. 
President was actually really difficult,” 
Le said. “There are some people who 
come in freshmen year with the goal: 
‘By the time I’m a senior I’m going 
to be A.S. President,’ but for me, get-
ting involved in student government 
was very difficult…the reason I got 
involved was because I saw a poster.”

Le then applied for a position on 

without the long-term political aspira-
tions — and, for her, this has made all 
the difference. 

“People think the entire realm of 
fashion is a joke,” she said. “But there’s 
so much beauty in it and it’s a way to 
bring people together. We all need to 
wear clothes, so why can’t we integrate 
that with science and math and cre-
ativity as a starting point to help the 
world too?”

ATHAR such as French, visual arts and non-fiction writing.
“I have a problem where I try to 

learn more than I need to, but it is 
really fun and I really enjoy it,” Athar 
said. “And you know, it keeps me sane 
because engineering is so brutal.”

GARCIA

cil (on her candidate statement, she 
promised to facilitate UCSD’s transi-
tion to Division I if it had passed, 
despite her own oppositions) but not 
everyone has been a fan. Garcia’s cam-
paign has been under attack by an 
opposing student from California State 
University Long Beach. Jason Aula, 
who has repeatedly posted on Garcia’s 
campaign event on Facebook, accuses 
the candidate of being racist, citing her 
involvement with MEChA as evidence.

 “He started posting on my event 
page alleging that I was a racist and 
that I was going to reclaim the south-
west and that I was an illegal immi-
grant,” Garcia said. “MEChA at UCSD 
and MEChA as a chapter does not 
advocate the things that he said.”

 Garcia doesn’t seem too concerned 
with the allegations, confident that 
most people know they’re baseless.  
“It’s not like I would get into office 
and suddenly say, ‘Illegal immigration, 
yes!’” Garcia said. “He’s kind of like 
a robot. He would keep posting [no 
matter what], and every time some-
one would post something positive he 
would write ‘No se puede.’”

Distractions aside, Garcia empha-
sizes what she thinks is one of the 
most important values an A.S. mem-
ber should uphold, something she 
currently finds lacking: accountability. 
“A lot of people throughout the year, 
they’ll go on about their business and 
then when it comes towards election 
time, they’ll start doing all these things 
they don’t normally do,” Garcia said. 
“They start being more active, they 
start being more outspoken on council. 
But the thing I want people to know is 
that I do this all the time, regardless 
of whether I’m running for anything.”

LE

Marshall College Council, where the 
chair at the time ultimately created 
positions for all the applicants, mak-
ing Le the student health insurance 
advisory committee rep. She later took 
jobs as an orientation leader, campus 
tour guide and executive assistant to 
the president of the Graduate Student 
Association. Currently, she serves as 
chair of TMC student council. As part 
of the more moderately progressive 
slate of this year’s election, TIDE, Le’s 
focus is on increasing transparency 
and visibility, while fighting for crucial 
resources for students such as trans-
portation.  

“I think sometimes we do forget 
that we’re students,” Le said. “Because 
we do have a lot of contact with admin-
istrators we feel that we’re a slight 
step above students… and what we do 
really does matter, but after a year we’re 
gone. So how we treat the students and 
how we have this sense of hierarchy 
doesn’t make sense at all. At the end of 
the day, when an administrator looks 
at us, we’re just another student with 
a title. We’re nothing more than that.”

Le’s top three priorities, should 
she be elected A.S. President, include 
working with the other UC schools 
and moving past the D-I referendum 
by recognizing our current athletes 
and improving school spirit. But most 
importantly, Le wants Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox’s successor to know 
who really has the power. 

“Another priority especially is 
establishing a very strong relationship 
between A.S. and the students and 
the new chancellor coming in next 
year,” Le said. “Because when he or she 
comes in that first council is going to 
be the one that sets the tone for how-
ever long the chancellor is staying here. 
So making sure that we have a very dis-
tinct and strong relationship, showing 
them that this is what we want and this 
is the amount of power students have.”

Fighting words, for a girl who loves 
Space Mountain.

LIANG

Take Coco Chanel. Chanel, Liang 
said, created the image of the powerful 
modern woman, “and she didn’t need 
to go through politics to do that. She 
channeled her creativity to inspire a 
generation of women who came after 
her.”  Liang has demonstrated this same 
capacity for outreach and unlikely ave-
nues of influence in every area of her 
life, from her stints living in Taiwan, 
Georgia and northern California, to 
her communications major, to her 
three years of spirit-focused service 
in student government. Her history of 
extracurricular involvement and focus 
on campus life stretches as far back 
as an elementary school position as a 
noon sports announcer. 

“I realized very early on that stu-
dent government was something I was 
comfortable with, that I love to out-
reach and connect,” she said. “I grew 
up near politics and I don’t like it, and 
so I have no plans for law school or a 
political career, but I just like to talk to 
people, and I want to help them.” 

Here, Liang began as a member of 
ERC student council then moved up 
to ERC Senator and, this year, serves 
as campuswide senator, Senate Chair 
and sits on the TritonLink Committee. 
Though her career has followed a pre-
dictable trajectory on the path to the 
presidential position, Liang said that 
she never intended to vie for the top 
spot. 

Bold is, in many ways, the succes-
sor of current President Alyssa Wing’s 
Board the Wing slate, which Liang ran 
on last year. Bold’s focus on Greek and 
athletic life, spirit and finding points 
of similarity among the students mir-
rors Liang’s emphasis on individual 
outreach, A.S. visibility and personal 
interaction with constituents. 

“We have legs, so why can’t we 
go down to the students?” she said. 
“Why do we need to wait for them 
to come to us?” She wants to preside 
over a council that will go to the stu-
dents themselves. Attend sports games. 
Find common ground and avoid the 
divisive issues. Most importantly, she 
wants to follow up with constituents in 
real time, instead of responding with 
the dreaded “I’ll forward this to some-
one who can help you” email. 

“My one drive to do all of this is to 
know that I’m doing what one student, 
or two, or 500 has always wanted to see 
here,” she said. “I want to create that 
kind of excitement. That’s what really 
makes me happy in A.S. — it’s the 
excitement or happiness you can bring 
to one person.”



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 9,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

UCSD Women’s Water Polo Prepare for Santa Clara Invitational
       “The third quarter has been our 
worst quarter all season long — 
maybe I’m not giving very good 
halftime speeches, I don’t know,” 
head coach Brad Kreutzkamp said 
to the athletics department. 

“We came out in the third and 
didn’t press them. We needed to 
win that quarter and we didn’t.” 
       Despite a slow start, the Tritons 

were able to pull back three, as 
Lizotte sunk a penalty and Biehle 
capitalized on breakaway with the 
third quarter coming to a close.

Looking to cut a two-goal lead, 
the Tritons suffered another slow 
start, allowing the Lancers an early 
goal to go up 7–10. 

Lizotte responded just five 
seconds after with her fourth goal 
of the game. 

The two teams battled down 

the stretch, but the Triton offense 
couldn’t galvanize to cut the Lancer 
defense, falling 8–11.

“Losing is always disappointing 
and even more so when we only go 
1 for 9 on our power plays,” head 
coach Brad Kreutzkamp said in an 
email interview. “We’ve had great 
practices and our power play has 
been becoming a strength of ours, 
so to perform like that was tough 
on us all.” 

However, our team has shown 
resilience all year long and I 
know we will perform better 
when our conference tournament 
takes place in a few weeks right 
here at UCSD. We will be ready.”  
       This weekend, the Tritons will 
travel up North to Santa Clara 
University where they will compete 
in the Bronco Invitational, a 
tournament pitting nine Western 
Water Polo Association teams—

San Jose State, Santa Clara, UCSD, 
CSU Bakersfield, CSU Monterey 
Bay, Colorado State, CSU San 
Bernardino, Sonoma State and 
CSU East Bay— against each other. 
       UCSD’s first game is slated for 
Saturday, April 14, when the Tritons 
will face off against CSU Monterey 
Bay at 9:15 a.m.

Tritons in Bid for Playoff  Berth
       Junior outside hitter Carl Eberts 
led the Tritons in the attack with 
12 kills, while sophomore outside 
hitter Vaun Lennon — last week’s 
AVCA National Player of the Week 
— chipped in eight kills. 

The sets were much tighter 
in Malibu. The Tritons lost a 
close 23–25 opening set, falling 
down the stretch despite out-
hitting the Waves 10 kills to eight.  
    Down 1–0, the Tritons seemed to 
lose some momentum, falling 19–25, 
in a set that was never really close. 

The Tritons went point-for-point 
with Pepperdine in the last set, until, 
with the score 18–16, the Waves’ 
Kyle Gerrans caught fire, logging 
three straight points to go up 21–16. 

The Tritons pulled back to within 
three points, but two costly UCSD 
service errors made the difference 
sunk the Tritons 21–25.

“In the course of the match versus 
Pepperdine we drastically improved 
our offensive production each game, 
but so did Pepperdine,” Ring said. 
“We didn’t serve tough enough, 
either missing too many serves 
or serving their best passer, so we 
struggled to slow down Pepperdine.”

With the pair of losses, the 
Tritons fall to 8–18 overall and 
6–15 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation.

The Tritons will look to claim 
a spot in the eight-team MPSF 
tournament. 

UCSD is still statistically in the 
hunt, but the Tritons will need to 
win their last match and hope that 
UC Santa Barbara wins their last 
two and that CSU Northridge drops 
their last two. 

BYU, Stanford, UC Irvine, UCLA 
and USC have all secured spots in 
the conference tournament. 

“We have one more conference 
match remaining and we are still in 
the hunt for a playoff position,” Ring 
said. “We’ll get back to practice on 
Monday and give it our best shot 
next Saturday.”

UCSD will host their last two 
regular season matches. On 
Thursday, April 12, the Tritons will 
host a non-conference match against 
Cal Baptist and on Saturday, April 
14, UCSD rounds out its regular 
season with a bout against UC 
Irvine.

Men’s Tennis Sits on Seven-Game Losing Streak
Triton aces Austin West and 

Devon Sousa suffered an 8–6 loss in 
the No. 1 doubles contest, to go along 
with a UCSD 8–4 defeat in the No. 2 
doubles match. 

UCSD didn’t fare much better in 
the singles component, as Jiganti was 
the only Triton to walk away with a 
win, besting the Argos’ Elio Latela in 
three sets at No. 4 singles. 

In the second day of the 
Invitational, the No. 15 St. Edwards 
Hilltoppers just narrowly edged the 
Tritons in a disappointing 5–4 loss.  
    In a peculiar repeat of the first day of 
competition, the Tritons dropped the 
No. 1 and No. 2 doubles matches by 
the same 8–6, 8-4 scores respectively. 
While Jiganti and Ling defeated St. 
Edwards’ Adrian Garza and Jonathan 
Stockdale 8-4 in the No. 3 doubles 
match. Down 2–1, the Tritons did 
well to take three singles matches 
from the higher-ranked Hilltoppers, 
but it wasn’t enough to overcome the 
early deficit.

A longtime UCSD mainstay, 
senior Chapman Chan took the No. 1 
singles contest 6–1, 6–4, while junior 
Junya Yoshida and West solidified 
wins for the Tritons in the No. 2 and 

No. 3 matches. But UCSD couldn’t 
hold up as Jiganti, Ling and Luu all 
lost their individual battles.

On Saturday, the Tritons ended 
competition by dropping to perennial 
powerhouses No. 3 Barry University. 

Last year’s National Tournament 
Runners up downed the Tritons 5–1 
in the last day of competition. 

The No. 3 duo of Jiganti and Ling 
remained perfect throughout the 
invitational, as they took UCSD’s only 
win throughout the weekend, beating 
out Barry’s Romain Costamagna and 
Ollie Lemaitre 8–4.

No. 1 doubles West and Sousa lost 
in another disappointing 8-6.

The Buccaneers took control of 
the singles matches, taking wins in the 
No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 singles — all in 
straight sets — to secure the win. 

The Tritons return to Southern 
California to round out their regular 
season. On Thursday, April 12, the 
Tritons face off against Point Loma 
Nazarene. On Sunday, April 15, 
UCSD closes out play with a match 
against Abilene Christian in Malibu, 
after which No. 19 UCSD will prepare 
for the NCAA Division II National 
Championships.

Tritons Fall at Home to Cal Baptist 8-11

NOLAN THOMAS/GUARDIAN

Sports Editor

The No. 18 UCSD Women’s Water Polo team snapped its four-game winning streak 
with an 8–11 loss at home to No. 19 
Cal Baptist last Friday, April 6. 

The Lancers shot out to an early 
lead that proved too much for the 
Tritons to overcome. 

Down 3–0 with two minutes left 
to play in the first period, senior 
driver Katherine Biehle took one 
back to cut the deficit to 3–1 going 
into the second quarter. 

The Tritons caught up to within 
one point in the second period, as 
Biehle and the Tritons’ leading goal 
scorer, sophomore Sarah Lizotte, 
combined for three goals to sneak 
to within one point by the end of 
the first half. 

Having nearly closed the gap, the 

Tritons dropped tempo at the start 
of the second half, as the Lancers 
came back with three straight goals. 

With four minutes left to play 
in the quarter, Cal Baptist took the

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL —Coming 
off an unprecedented five-game 
winning streak, the No. 11 UCSD 
Men’s Volleyball team was derailed 
this weekend on the road against 
No. 1 USC and No. 6 Pepperdine.  
    The Tritons were shut out in both 
games. On Thursday, April 5 against 
the Trojans, UCSD logged a dismal 
six kills on eight attempts, for a -0.08 

attack percentage, falling 16–25 in 
the first set. 

UCSD failed to rebound 
in the second set, as the Tritons 
recorded another sloppy offensive 
performance, with 10 kills on nine 
errors. 
     While on the other side of the net, 
USC remained on point, slating just 
11 errors to the Tritons’ 26.

“We had a lot of confidence 
heading into our match with 
No. 1 ranked USC as we were 

riding a five match winning streak 
with victories over [UC Santa 
Barbara], [CSU Long Beach], [CSU 
Northridge], UCLA and UCSB 
again,” head coach Kevin Ring said 
in an email interview.  “USC was on 
a great streak of their own as they 
had won 13 in a row heading into the 
match with us. I felt like we played 
well at times, but we let USC control 
the match from the service line.”
