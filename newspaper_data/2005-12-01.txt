Planning troubles 
hold up eledion 

By MAn L'HEUREUX 
Senior Staff Writer 

The special campuswide elec-
tion, which will determine the 
future of Student-Run leIevi ion 
regulation passed by the .S. 
Council this fall, has been sched-
uled for Jan. 23 untiIJan. 27 - Out-
side of the IS-day deadline man-
dated in the .5. Constitution. 

On Nov. 9, member of SRTV 
and the banned program " Koala 
TV" presented the council with 
a petition demanding that a pe-
cial election be called to evaluate 
legislation passed by the council , 
including a ban on pornography 
and "Koala TV" from th e q:Hioll 
A pe tition require signatures 
from at least 10 percent of the 
undergraduate rudent body to 
force a special election, a thresh-
old that was met with more than 
2,600 ~ignarures collected by peti-
tioners. 

According to the counci l's gov-
erni ng documen ts, specia l elec-
tions must be he ld wi th in 15 busi-
ness days of the da te of the peti-
tion 's presentation. T he fai lure to 
meet the consti tutional deadline 
has prompted criticism from the 
petitioners. 

"There is a set policy to be 
fo llowed in everything the A.S. 
does," SRTV co-Manager Andrew 
Tess said. "These have not been 
fo llowed to the letter, and it con-
sistently TU ns them into trouble." 

The delayed election is simply 
due to the massive taslc of assem-
bling a special election, according 
to Revelle College Senior Senator 
Rachel Corell. 

"We all recognize th at we 
can't just th row together an elec-
tion in 15 days," A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten said at the 
counci l meeti ng on ov. 30. "[The 
petitionersj agreed to it as long as 
it lasted over five days [instead o~ 
the two origi nally planned. " 

Some petitioners agreed with 
weeten's decision. 

"I very much approve of Chris 
weeten's decision to extend the 

election over five day ," said Earl 
Warren College senior Daniel 
\ Va tes , a vocal member of the 
petitioni ng students. "It was the 

right move. " 
lthough she said she is aware 

that a month and a half of break 
could dull the i sue in the minds 
of tudent voters , Corell believes 
that the media attention given to

The state of California is near the 

bottom of the national barrel when

bachelor's and entry-level master's 
degree programs at UCLA's School 
of Nursing. The program, expected 
to begin fall 2006, will offer the only 
undergraduate nursing program in

boost will double the number of 
nursing students who enroll at the 
school, from 300 to 624, by 2010. 
Because of burgeoning populption 
numbers, study estimates project that 
the state will require an additional 
43,000 nurses by 2010, and 74,000 
more by 2020 jOst to keep its current

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting .14 - Nov. 30_ 

Public Input 
Earl Warren College senior 

Daniel Watts spoke against a pro-
posed allocation of $200 to the 
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity on the 
grounds that passing the item would 
exceed double the limit allowed 
under council guidelines. WattS 
asked the council to withdraw the 
item, announcing that he planned 
to "slam them with this" in his quest 
for the A.S. presidency in the event 
that it was passed. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemE 

The council aUocated an addition-
al $800 to the KoiJIa from the media-
unallocated account. Although Knala 
affiliates have been the center of 
much recent A.S. controversy, the 
allocation was ultimately passed in a 
17 -2 -0 vote. 

Item I 
Despite WattS' protest and a 

motion to table the item indefinitely, 
the extra $200 dollars were awarded 
to the fraternity by a vote of 13-2 -4. 

Reports 
President Christopher Sweeten 

Sweeten announced that applica-
tions for the A.S. elections manager 
are now open to oversee the special 
election called by "Koala TV" peti-
tioners earlier this month. The elec-
tion will take place from Jan. 23 to 
27 and applications for the position 
will dose Dcc. 2. 

Sixth CoUege Senior Senator 

Matt ColTllles 
Corrales presented 35 students' 

requests for refunds of their portion 
of student acti0ty fees spent on the 
Nov. 15 production of the Koa/a. 
Petitions to request the refunds have 
10 calendar days to be filed, and 
must be honored by the council. 

Council Caucus 
John Muir College Council Chair 

Neil Spears di5(.'USSCd the current 
A.S. Councillistserv, and the advan-
tages and potential disadvantages 
of allowing any VCSD students to 
access it. Currently, any student who 
wishes to gain access to the listserv 
may do so by malcing a request to 
the A.S. executive assistant. 

Several council members 
expressed the desire to limit access 
and posting to councilmembcrs, not 
for "sinister purposes" but because it 
is a place for the council to cany our 
initial brainstonns outside of student 
and media scrutiny. • 

However, responding to the 
desire to media-proof council busi-
ness, some councilmembcrs argued 
that forethought and restraint rep-
resent a better way to avoid embar-
rassing publicity. 

"What we say should matter," 
Muir Sophomore Senator Aida 
KuzuC'.m said. "I think if we open it 
up, it would put a little more weight 
on us to act as representatives, rather 
than show just our own opinions." 

Spears later proposed legislation 
that would allow any undergradu-
ate student who wanted access to 
the listserv the ability to obtain it. 
Although 12 senators voted in favor 
of Spears' item, seven voted against 
it, and thus it did not reach the 
threshold needed for passage.

York: Porn producer favors A.S. autonomy 
continued from page r 

It would be the first installment 
of York's pornography trilogy on 
SRTV. 

But for -the self-proclaimed 
rabble rouser, his pornography 
highlights the most important 
fight for free speech on campus, 
York said. 

"You can call me a button-
pusher all you want, but it doesn't 
change: the fact that I brought 
up a topic important to our gen-
eration, especially at this school," 
York said. "Are protected forn1s 
of speech really protected around 
here? What can we broadcast, 
what can we not and what should 
we be able to do?" 

For others, York's boundary-
testing mentality reflects his reck-
less and attention-addicted per-
sona, especially his third differ-
ent broadcast of sex featuring an 
adult-film actress with Thurgood 
Marshall College Senior Senator 
Kate Pillon's face superimposed 
on the actress' body. 
• "I was attacked," Pillon said 
after the airing, which York called 
a political satire. "It might have 
been an attack on me as a pub-
lic and political figure, but it's 
not something I want to watch . 1 
don't want to engage Steve York. 
Fighting back is stooping to his 
level and gratifying him." 

York 's former position as edi-
lor in chief of the Koala, a campu 
publication notorious for target-
ing administrators such as Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson, only gives 
opponents more ammunition to 
characterize the porn producer as 
a glory hound. 

"Sure, political satire reminds 
the campus of how important the 
First Amendment is, but J found it 
personally offensive," Ratcliff said. 
"I thi nk that it is just reflective ~f 

what Vork and the Koala have done 
on campus in the past, when they 
target student leaders and admin-
istrators for shock value." 

While York admitted the 
broadcast was a "low blow," he 
said it uncovered a long-running 
tradition of administrative tyranny. 
York said he spoke to Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox eartier this year 
about his plans to continue air-
ing sexual content. Fox, as well as 
other administrators, expressed a 
need to keep the topic a "student 
issue," according to York. But after 
Ratcliff demanded the fonnation 
of a program review board before 
reactivating the station 's signal , that 
promise was broken, York said. 

"It's sad when the mentality of 
the administration is that their stu -
dents can't deal with decisions," he 
said. "It's all lip service and double 
talk when it comes to trust." 

Ratclifrs opposition to a special 
e lection, in which students will 
vote on whether or not the station 
will be able to broadcast sexual 
nudity, is indicative o f his lack of 
faith in students, York said. 

Under the A.S. Constitution, if 
students vote to approve the nudity 
provision, the A.S. Council cannot 
revisit the measure for a year, a 
window of time that would leave 
the university legally liable, Ratcli ff 
said. In the end, the university owns 
the cables that transmit the SRTV 
signal, which gives it the ultimate 
purview of whether or not the sta-
tion should be on the air. 

Go figure, York said. 
"So Ratcliff has basically said 

'fuck you ' to the A.S. Constitution 
and the 2,600 students that signed 
that petition?" he said. "Because 
students don 't own those cables, 
administrators can pull the plug 
on a service students pay for 
whenever they feel like it? Well 
then, we shouldn't even bother

having students nm the station in 
the first place." 

UCSD should not bother hav-
ing a student government ei ther, if 
the A.S. Counci l conti nues to bow 
to administrative demands, York 
said, accusing Watson of pressur-
ing the student government. 

"Senators tabled the nudity 
ban , then Watson speaks and 
they come running to meet his 
demands," York said . UAutonomy 
of the A.S. Council is dlC thing 
here. H ow can we trust our elect-
ed representatives if they work for 
admini strators?" 

For now, whether his opponents 
believe it or not, York said he s 
rt:ady to bow out of the spotlight. 

"J started a dialogue at UCS D, 
which was all I wanted," he said . 
" ow it's time to work behind ·the 
scenes on this election so that the 
students ' voice can be heard."

Congress misses the big 
picture on U.S. debt 

D oublethink," George Orwell wrote, "means the 
power of holding two con-
tnldictory beliefs in one's 
mind simultaneously, and 
accepting both of them." 
The current "deficit-reduc-
tion" plan that will actu-
ally illC1'eose America's debt 
would make Orwell roll over 
in his grave. 

Under the proposal, the 
federal goverrunent wou ld 
trim nearly $50 billion in 
pending - mostly from 

programs serving the poor 
and almost $15 billion from 
student loans - in order 
to finance tax cuts that 
would cost the country even 
more. Ironically, this self-
proclaimed return to fiscal 
discipline for lawmaker 
comes just month after they 
approved tens of billions of 
dollars in pork spending 
attached to the highway and 
energy bills. 

After watching the red ink 
swell, aJl Americans should 
welcome an honest dialogue 

about our nation's priorities. 
Sadly, we must all wait a bit 
longer for the honesty. 

Clo ing the budget gap 
will likely entail tightening 
belts for all, including stu-
dents; that may mean asking 
us to do more with les finan-
cial aid. However, spending 
cut~ must al 0 be matched 
with structured tax increases 
- or, at least, no further tax 
reductions. Both low taxes 
and a well-educated populace 
help fuel economic growth, 
and one should not come at 
the expense of the other. 

Though Congress refuses 
to admit it, debt - whether 
the result of excessive spend-
ing or inadequate taxes 
- only discourages future 
investment, hurting the 
economy for years to come. 

These days, when it seems 
that lawmakers are more 
interested in robbing Peter 
to pay Paul, Orwell offers 
vahlable advice: "In a tim.e of 
universal deceit, telling the 
truth becomes a revolution-
ary act." 

Chancellor should speak 
up in U,House debate 
C hancell or Marye Anne Fox has been quick to criticize fed-
eral lawmakers for proposed 
cuts in financial aid, accusing 
Congress of failing to give 
education its due respect. 
But that activism stands in 
strange contrast to Fox's 
silence in a local debate: one 
over the future of the $7.2-
million reconstruction of 
University House, her pro~ 
spective residence. 

The home, part of her 
contract with the univer-
sity, will require the cam-
pus to spend $800,000 of its 
own money, and even more 
from the UC Office of the 
President. 

So far, UCOp, univer ity 
employees and their unions 
have made their positions 
clear; but Fox has not bro-
ken her pubJjc si lence. That 
has proven convenient for 
UCOp, which continues to 
point to the housing guaran-
tee in Fox's contract to jus-
tify rebuilding the La Jolla 

Famls mansion. But if Fox 
came out publicly against the 
plan, the university would 
likely heed her wishes. 

Few would say that hav-
ing a campus-owned resi-
dence should not be a priori-
ty. But just as Congress must 
choose among a variety of 
worthwhile spending goals, 
UCSD must decide what to 
do with a limited supply of 
money and a limitless num-
ber of important needs. 

Fox, who has made much 
of her online "chancellor 
chats," must now explain 
why spending money on 
her house should be a big-
ger pLiority than building 
transfer-student apartments 
or providing staff with badly 
needed pay raises. 

Sounding off on Capitol 
Hill policy from 2,000 miles 
away is, in reality, of little 
impqrt. Addressing a con-
troversy at home, though, 
is much more valuable and 
consequential. 

After all, all politics is local.

Global warming not as clear .... cut 
as politics makes it out to be 

By DAVID CERUTTI 
Contributing Writer 

T he common perceptions of global wanning amount to monstrous fantaSies propa-
gated by the mainstream media . 
The notion that global wanning, 
if it occurs at all, wi ll be a pleasant 
thing that merely brings wannth 
to previously inhospitable places is 
Panglossian. The accusation that 
global wanning is President George 
W Bush's mult is ridiculous. The 
idea that fossil -fuel consumption is 
the sole source of greenliouse gases 
is wrong. The idea that human 
activities have negligible impact on 
aonospheric carbon dioxide content 
is patently false. The characteriza-
tion of global wanning as a hoax 
is a deceitful mixture of malice and 
negligence, just as the chardcreriza-
tion of environmentalists as a band 
of left-wing activists is a numbing 
concoction of prejudice and willful 
ignorance. 

in short, the public perception 
of human-induced climate change 
is largely fueled by environmental-
ist hyperbole and anti-environmen-
talist denial. The scientific antidote 
is not a compromise between the 
two positions, but a 6nn warning 
to the industrial and developing 
world: Manmade greenhouse gases 
are augmenting natural attnospher-
ic cycles to increase global tem-
peratures, which will change global 
climates. 

in an effort to cover all bases, 
conservative commentators have 
recently been advancing positions 

that paint global wanning (in case 
it's actually happening) as a mere 
continuation of previous trends 

tha~ have made the planet more 
temperate for human civilization. 
Cato Institute researcher adjunct 
and Institute for Energy Research 
President Robert Bradley opined 
in 1998 and again in 2003 that the 
quality of our air has improved, 
despite the increasing use of fos-
si l fuels, and that carbon diox-
ide merely greens the planet "A 
mode[':ltely wanner, wetter world, 
whether natural or anthropogenic, 
such as experi enced durin g the 2 Oth 
century, is a better world," he sug-
gested.John 'Tierney recently relat-
ed his experiences with an Inuit 
tribe in his New York Ttmes column, 
citing its hope that a longer and 
wanner wet season would improve 
the tourist industry. 

He is correct that modem envi-
ronmental policies of developed 
countries are far superior to those 
of primitive societies. Bradley is also 
correct in that carbon dioxide can-
not reasonably be called a pollutant. 
But a moderately wanner, wetter 
San Diego is Houston; a moder-
ately wanner Houston is a tropical 
marshland. The vast majority of 
the world lives in areas that would 
become less hospitable were they 
to be wanner and wetter - a. few 
Inuits notwithstanding. 

As for the carbon greening 
effect, carbon dioxide is seques-
tered by plants and algae as car-
bohydrates, like cellulose. But 
any chemist can calculate that the 
amount of carbon dioxide removed 

from the air by plants is reintro-
du~d to the atmosphere when the 
plant dies and decomposes. The 
carbon being brought up from oil 
and t'Oal 6elds is being introduced 
to the biosphere from much deeper 
sequestration, adding extra carbon 
to the biosphere at a current rate of 
six billion tons per year. A "green-
ing" of the planet can also include 
the proliferation of algae, and con-
sequently, the sepsis of va luable 
lakes and waterways. Apologists for 
anthropogenic global wanning do 
cite correct facts, but they fail to 
think thei r position through. 

For at least 20 years, America 
has been the world's largest pro-
ducer of carbon dioxide, consis-
tently producing about 25 percent 
of the world's total, according to a 
Department of Energy assessment. 
As noted above, this does hOt imply 
that America's skies are the dirtiest: 
Carbon dioxide is not soot. Chinese 
oil <.'Onsumption is another major 
unearther of fossil carbon; today, 
up to a quarter of Los Angeles' air 
pollution can be traced to China, 
a result of directional winds. Soon 
China will surpass America 3S the 
world's largest producer of carbon 
dioxide. 

Just as carbon dioxide itself is 
not a noxious pollutant, it is not 
the strongest greenhouse gas, albeit 
vastly more plentiful than others 
such as methane. Furthennore, in 
any economy, carbon fuels are not 
the only source of carbon dioxide.

Get ready Republican parents: ·I'm 
. coming home for the holidays 
Lines in 
the sand 

Ian S. Port 

T he holidays are und~rrdted. For ex-suburban libera l wackos like me, eating, get-
ting presents and being with family 
- two of which every other good 

merican is fixated upon starting 
12:0 I a. m. ov. I - are just the 
icing on the real cake-y joy of the 
holidays, slightly better than having 
to take out my parents' trash again. 

The real point of going home 
for a whole freaking month is not to 
elljoy the fami ly, especially if you're 
a young, slightly socialistic pWldit-
in-Pampers. The real point of the 
holidays, these days anyway, is dis-
cussing (read: warring over) politics 
with the right-minded nestminders 
that raised me. 

You see, no matter how "edu-
cational" we imagine li fe on this 
expensive cliff to be, going back to 
those chalky Republican cul-de-sacs, 
where Bush bumper stickers are 
stiU as popular as lifted Suburbans, 
makes one realize just how isolated 
from reality our academic life is. 0 
matter how many "Communism 
and Social Policy" or "Art in the 
Era of American Imperiali sm" 
classes I've sat through, somehow 
the first ational RiAe Association 
sticker ! see on the drive home 
gets my blood rushing so hard T 
have to chuck my organic, fair-
trade, shade-grown coffee in its 
recycled cup right at the offending 
Excursion. 

CaJllittering hypocritic-dl if you 
want. But remember: This is the 

holidays. 
Besides, the real angst doesn't 

kick in until I get north of L.A. 
Descending into the murky humi-
dor of the Centr.u Valley might 
be the shits for some, but where 
else can you find either Michael 
Savage or Rush Limbaugh on every 
English A.M. [':ldio band? I love 
Bakers6eld - passi ng by on each 
trip home, I realize I've been miss-
ing some vita l advice on how to 
survive in the treacherous world 
of tricksters, traitocs and tcachers. 
(Tell me, Rush: How fO/I I deal with 
an "arrogant, blasphemous, stupid, 
arrogant liberal?" Of course: Call 
them stupid. Those idiotic egoists 
hate being called srupid even more 
than they hate America.) 

But radical radio detours are 
child's play compared to the kind 
of TV you can 6nd in houses with 
cable, J remember upon arrival. 
Rush can spit fire by playground 
rules, but his impact craters are infi-
nitely smaller than the ones blown 
by my Fox News favorites Sean 
Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. I started 
becoming periodically obsessed 
with "The O'Reilly Factor" back 
when Bush was bad enough but 
we didn't have the grim cloud of 
war hanging over our hot political 
heads. Back then it was comedy. 
After almost four years of leftist 
indoctrination (a social science 
degree), watching his smug piel 
feels like spying a blood-soaked vil-
lain chop off the limbs of a shriek-
ing. still -breathing victim - and' ! 
love horror movies. 

Watching Fox ews only 
on holidays at home ttlTnS the 
Propaganda Channel into a sick 
fetish, and I absolutely love it -
possibly because some, uh, other . 
people in the place take it seri-

ously. I, at first, refused to believe 
this, thinking they just pretended 
to be lieve for my enjoyment. But 
then I found myself having to logi-
cally deconstruct the euphemisms 
of their anchors to a 'keptical audi-
ence. ("You don't rea lly think every-
thing in the New York Times is a lie, 
do you, Mom?") 

Now, jousting over polities with 
my super-conservative parents is 
an established tradition for which 
we both anticipate and prepare. 
I remember the brutal details of 
the four propositions Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger tried to sneak past 
us; they save the newspaper arti-
cle (nat from the NY!) about the 
San Diego artist who gives "iIIe-
g:J1 immigrants" sturdy shoes with 
maps to help them cross the border. 
You need to fuel the fire with some-
thing (especially when Christmas 
music replaces the . dimwit din of 
Fox), and we burn pretty hot in the 
erl of Valerie Plame, secret prisons, 
gay marriage and Hillary Clinton as 
a presidential candidate. 

Before! turned into such a fair, 
rational thinker, our battles used to 
get bloody. We'd have to separate 
ourselves for the rest of the day after 
discussing Clinton's cock or Bush's 
drug/vacation habits. owadays we 
keep it to just a checkup, a chance 
to make sure that each other's vitals 
arc working okay. 

"You stil l for that warnlonger-
ing, whiffle-ball-brained president 
we got?" 

"Sure are, kid. You sti ll a homo-
loving, tree-hugging Marxist?" 

To which I nod, smile and sigh. 
You just can't get this kind of enter-
tainment in college.

the above statistics, liberates more 
than 4{) percent of the mass of 
the originaJ ccment in the fonn of 
carbon dioxide. In short, while the 
United States is one major source 
of greenhouse gases among several 
others, its current levels of output 
are in no way bucking a decades-old 
trcnd. Likewi e, the staple product 
of "big oil" is not the sole source 
of carbon emissions. I t's not Bush's 
fault, but it is his problem. 

Just as misinfornlation is spread 
about global wanning it~clf, simi-
lar falsehoods arc spread about the 
fossil -fuel consumption ~\J1d other 
processes t1lat create carbon dioxide. 
"Concrete" cures naturally in volca-
noes, as limestone produces carbon 
dioxide at high temperarures. This 
fact does not support anti-global-
wanning statements claiming that 
volcanism or other natural processe 
emit much more carbon dioxide than 
industrial societies. Mount Ema, in 
Sicily, is a rare case among volcanoes 
in that , it emits 25 million tons of 
carbon dioxide per year; the entire 
Pacific Rim volcanic range emits on 
the order of lOO lnillion tons. 

But all of this pales in com-
parison to the six billion tons of car-
bon that human industry produces 
annua lly. Even more appalling is a 
recent claim advanced by Jerome 
Corsi in a new book, "Black Gold 
Stranglehold," suggestiJlg that oil is 
not a fossil fuel but instead produced 
continuously by proces es happen-
ing deep within the Earth . The 
co-author of the anti-John Kerry 
book "Unfit for Command," Corsi 
seems to be a jack of all tirades: 
As his comrades bellow that global 
wamling is a hoax, Corsi argues t113t 
America's dependence on foreign oil 
is all a giant ruse played by interna-
tional culprits. 

Curiously, Corsi credits the orig-
inal theory to scientists in Stalinist 
Russia, a hnltal regime also known 
for its eli tortion of science. Ilis 
characterization of the scienti fie con-
sensus for the origin of oil and coa l 
borders on a caricature, suggesting 
that geologists and petrochemical 
enhrineers believe til esc fuels are the 
decayed carcasses of large dinosaurs 
like tho e in M )Brana. Every frC'ih -
man biology student I ca r;l~ that 
mcgaf,lUna are really a minute por-
tion of all biomass; what is oil in 
sandstone today was mo,t1r dead 
algae in lmderwarer mud hundred, 
of millions of ye'lrs ago. 

Over th'c cou rse .of geologic 
time, the consequencc~ of human 
action will be dampened by much 
more powerful equilibria like the 
ones that formed fo il fuels and 
limestone in the first place. 

But, over the course of the next 
century, those consequences may 
be very difficult for human civiliza-
tion to bear. umerous ~ources , 
including a 2004 economic paper 
published in "Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences," 
have pointed out that the pro-
posed KyotO treaty is doomed by its 
own lack of punitive enforcement. 
IJldeed, as the article also notes, 
the present state of carbon emis-
sions is a fonn of "tragedy of the 
conunons," as difficult to escape in 
economic and political terms as the 
changes in climate brought about 
by carbon emissions \\~II be in the 
coming decades. 

One day, it may bc economi-
cally advantageous (read: necessary, 
though costly) to resequester car-
bon in the form of carbon dioxide 
in aging oil fields or deep oceanic 
trenches. Until then, a good pair of 
neaker is one way to postpone the 

day of reckoning.

Birth: Doctors wary of prescribing patch Vote: Petitions' validity disputed 
continued /rom page I 

warning that users of the patch 
may be exposed to 60 percent more 
e~trogen than those using typical 
birth-control pills. 

Because the reportS have not 
heen validated by independent sci-
entific resea rch, UCS D Student 
Il ealth will conti nue to distrib-
ute the patch to qualified candi-
dates, according m Student 1 Iea lth 
Advocate Co-ordinator Erin 
"Iollslce. 

"The p:lteh and o ther honnon-
al methods remain safe and are 
among the most effective ways to 
prc\ent unintended pregnancy," 
she ,taled in an e-mail. "The sa llle 
precautions are used for the patch 
as for any other honmma l hirth-
cOlltrol method . Women should 
Ix: hOI1l:Sl with dlcir health-care 
prmider about their hea lth risks, 

including smoking, so that their 
personal risks can be appropriately 
evaluated." 

Interestingly, an examination 
of contraceptives by several doc-
tors published in the Journal of 
/be t11nI'1'icnn Mrdicnf Association in 
2001 found that dIe patch poses 
the same blood-clot risks as birth-
control pills. 

The patch has hecome a more 
popular contraceptive because it 
requires only O/~e applicatiun a 
week, as opposed to dIe birth-con-
trol pill , which needs to be ingest-
ed dai ly for an extended period of 
time, "Ib uslee said. In addition, the 
patch is very dependable, she said. 

"The patch is a very reliable 
method of birth control and is 
dlought to be just as - if not more 
effective - than the birth-control 
pill ," Touslee said. " It is estimated 

that fewer than one out of 100 
women who use the patch wiU 
become pregnant." 

Still, because of the recent con-
cerns, some doctors are hesitant to 
prescribe one patch to any patient, 
even if they do not exhibit the risk 
factors. 

"J am currently not recom-
mending the patch until more 
information about this is avail-
able," said Kathryn M acaulay, a 
doctor with the UCSD depart-
ment of reproductive medicine. "J 
am UJlaware of any UCSD stu-
dents having problems wim the 
patch. Patients are not asking for 
the patch any less frequently, in 
my practice, since this infonnation 
became available."

the controversy will provide the 
necessary boost to give the elec-
tion a fair turnout. 

"Jt's still a big topic of debate, 
and I think it will still be in 
January, especially if SRTV is sti ll 
shut down by that point," she 
sa id . 

Although Tess is unsure of the 
ramifications of the break between 
the petition and the election, he 
also said that politica lly active 
students on campus will make 
an effort to get their messages 
across. 

The validity of the petition 
itself was called into question ear-
li er this month, when an unspeci-
fied number of students alleged 
that they were "intimidated" by 
"Koala TV" member into signing

She could face a fine of up to 
$1,000 and be charged with a mis-
demeanor. Vice operations runs 
undercover stings once a month 
ci tywide, and encowlters viola-
tions approximately 10 percent of 
the time, Darwent said. 

Violations are forwarded to the 
police's Alcohol Beverage Control 
Department, which reviews cases. 
The pub's managers must now 
present their vers.ion of the facts 
and then decide whether 01' not 
they will accept punishment for 
the violation or take the case to a 
hearing, according to ABC inves-
tigator Jennifer Hi ll. 

Potential penalties include a 
IS -day suspension of the pub's 
alcohol license, or a monetary fine 
- ranging from a minimum of 
$750 to a maximum of $3 ,000 
- in lieu of the suspension. Her 
department has not yet received 
me case, Hi ll said. 

Fai luTe to check identification 
is a rare occurrence, and the pub 
is usually scrupulous about card-
ing, according to pub managers. 
From the onset of training, a large 
emphasis is placed on checking 
the ID of anyone that appears 
under the age of 30. 

The establishment's employees 
manual provides tips on how to 
distinguish a real 1 D from a fake 
one. A case of confiscated fake 
lDs also hangs on the wall as 
exa mples. 

Still, the violation was clear, 
Darwent sa id. 

McNaughton said he is doubt-
ful that the pub will be shut 
down. 

"We are the last fun business," 
he said. <OJ don't thinl.: UCSD stu-
dents would let it happen ."

~ f you 're a fan of the awcsom~ campy original, th e preview of the new "King Kong" may have taken"you by surprise. Immed iately obvious from the trailer is 
that Peter Jackson spent every penny of his moostrous 
special effects budget, cre:lting ~ monster-heavy film 
where the titl e character is no longer a comical pup-
pet-ape hut an accurate, if a little oversized, silverback 
gorilla. 

In jecting personality into a CGI character shouldn't 
he a problem for Jackson, who hit such a goldmi ne with 
Andy Serkis' Gollum that he put Serkis back in front of 
the green screen for Kong's movement mapping. The 
question isn't whether this ape will emote, it's whether 
it will out-act the rest of the cast. 

Turning a c1un!..)' black-and·white classic into a slick 
special effects vehicle hasn 't always been a great bet

genre (remember "Godzilla"?) Some will pin this as 
a make-or-break for Jackson, who could hardly have 
a bigger mountain of success from which to tumble 
down . The mere coexistence, however, of Jack Black 
and Ad rien Brody should be enough to make up for 
the inevitable loss of camp. Naomi Watts sea ls the deal; 
watching her screa m her way to the top of the Empire 
State Building should be this holiday season's best (and 
most expensive) cheap thrill.

Edition of the film noir will be a bencr gas for comic book 
nerds with a dynamic disc-duo, complete with audio com-

The pulpy grit of "Sin City" splashes,on the screen with shots

S erenity," the film continuation ·to the short-lived TV eries "Firefly," is the perfect remedy to help soothe biner fans' resentment against Fox cancelling the cult 
show. 'T he creative mind of Joss Whedon (of "BuflY" fame) 
brings the beautifully crafted and acclaimed fullJristic series 
to the screeJl with some of the winiest and quirkiest rebels to 
ever control a spacecraft. 

The one-disc DVD contai ns the usual bonu es - out-
takes, deleted scenes and commentary from writer/director 
Whedon. But it al 0 offers several interesting featurettes, 
including a couple behind-the-scenes vignettes of "Firefly," 
a Whedon introduction and the intriguing 'documentary 
"Future History: T he Story of Earth That Was." The COI11 -
plete season of "Firefly" DVD is also an excellent companion 
piece and necessary addition to any sci-Ii collection.

Arrested Development 
(Season One) 

W

hat does a networle. do 
when given the rare gift 
of a genius comedy with a 

terrific ensemble, wry voice-overs 
from Ron Howard, sly pop-cul-
ture references and a willingness 
not to treat the audience lik.e idi-
ots? Fox's choice: Neglect it, pull 
it off the air and reduce its cur-
rent season order from 22 to 13 
episodes - all but putting the 
final nail in the coffin. So enjoy 
the fi rst two seasons of "Arrested 
Development" currently available 
on DVD (along with the token 
commentaries, bloopers, deleted 
scenes and behind-the-scenes 
extras). And when you're done, 
you'll wonder what those moronic 
Fox executives are doing by com-
pletely ignoring the gem they've 
had in their hands. Hell , Charlize 
Theron showed up this season for 
five episodes and there was nary 
an ad touting her appearance. 
Then again, why should Fox try 
to save "Arrested Development" 
when they can tout the wonders 
that are "The War at Home" and 
"Stacked"?

Nonfiction 

~ fDanielJe Steele wrote nonfiction, furlongs of potential toilet paper would be wasted on lousy books. 
GQOc\ wipes are accessible, made to 
absorb and, to most, something one 
simply cannot do without, which is 
more than can be said about Steeles 
work. This year, two books s!Jlu1 
be pan of every well-stocked &.tb-
room; both are controversial, an4 
they make for much better stoctipt-
stuffers than tissue rolls, too. 

As a long-time New Y01'k Tmiir

Fiction 

I r has been a long 12 years since Gabri el Garcia M arquez bestowed a novel to faithful read-
ers of his masterful and engaging 
narratives . 

A winner of the Nobel Prize, 
Marquez perpetuates th e th eme 
of old age and the remembrance 
of young love in "Memories of 
My Melancholy Whores," whose 
main character is keenly reminis-
cent of Florentino Ariza in "Love 
in the Time of Cholera." 

It is hard to resist a 128-page 
novella that begins with the line, 
"The year [ turned ninety, ] want-

HIATUS 13 

ed to give myself the gift of 
a night of wild love with an 
adolescent virgin" and it will 
be an enticing read for both the 
veteran Marquez reader and a 
novice just discovering him. 

Other notable novels include 
"Lunar Par"" by Bret Easton Ell is 
(a uthor of "American Psycho") 
for less squeamish readers who 
can endure its signature graphic 
content, and G regory Mabruire's 
"Wicked: The Life and Times of 
the Wicked Witch of the West," 
recently adapted into a Broadway 
musical.

Poor People's Day 
Mush 
.............................................. 

When every beat starts to bwnp in twle, when every rhyme seems to fude into the last, when every 
50 Cent video overlaps to fonn one 
mind-nwnbing heap, it's good to 
know we've still got innovators like 
Bigglus. 

A constant label-hopper, the native 
New Yorker first ta!>1:ed fame as c0-
founder of '90s indie phenomenon 
Company Flow along with now-Ieg-
enda.ry producers Mr. Len and £lOoP' 
Since the group split, Jus has earried 
on its influential legaey with politi-
cally charged releases both as a solo 
artist and as one half of NMS (with 
Orko E1ohiem). For Poor Propk's Day, 
Jus stuck Atlanta up-and-comcr OJ 
Gman on the beats - and it's hot 
as hell . 

Forget srrucrure. Forget every-
thing you've ever learned about 
rhythm or flow. Jus and GIl1liJ1 know 

**** differen t1y, and they're carving their 
own stonny path through self-gen-
er.ned layers of musical renovation. 
"Excuse me Miss Liberty 1 don't mean 
to be a misogynist! But put some lip-
stick on them green lips, 'cuz the rruth 
ain't a pretty birch," Jus spits over an 
orchestral, jerky-yet-f1uid beat. Rage 
against the current adminisrration 
and a passion for the plight of the 
poor drive Jus' far-from-trite lyrical 
tornado, ferociously spiraling in and 
around the dips and peaks of his 
producer's dark, enchanting noise. 

Though one can sometinles feel 
lost within the barrage of metaphori-
cal concepts and unaligned rhythms, 
no one ever said hip-hop was sup-
posed to be easy. It's about time some-
one decided to take the ball out of 
bounds.

Iruce SprlftlSteea 
Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition 
Sony 
................................................................ 

Good thing we're all stealing the record companies' music, because it forces them to remasrcr and re-relt:asc their aging clas-
sics. More often than not, the new versions 
come with extras (in this case, a concert OVD, 
expansive liner norcs, and some making-of com-
mentary) - as well as a hefty price tag. Expect 
the same from the 30th anniversary thrce-dise 
set of B017l to Run, the albwn pegged by dinosaur 
musicians as the epic high point of rock 'n' roll. 

"Epic" perfectly describes Springsteen's 
rOl11l1J1tic missive from his downtrodden Jersey 
hood, where the day's entertainment came from 
fighting, dodging police (back when they werc 
"cherry-tops'), secretly meeting with dolled- up 
sweethearts ,md, mosl importantly, getting the 

****~ hell out. The E Srreet Band's perfom1llJ1cc is 
gigantic, from the wailing hannonica opening of 
"Thunder Road" to the now-diche sax solo and 
12-plus key changes of the awesomely perfect 
title rrack. Springsteen was still in his rhym-
ing dictionary days, fresh from his better (but 
certainly not greater) The Wild, the ilmocent. and 
the E Sl7'I~et SJJlIfjk, recorded when he was still a 
hunlble shit. &171 to RIm isn't hwnble, but that's 
the chaml: Somctinles you need to grnb )'our 
girl by the aml, leap into your hemi-powcred 
suicide machine and ~-pecd off in an everlasting 
embrace - if only in song fonn.

................................................................ 

It's albwns like Hypermllgic Mountain that show the uselessnc.~s of language, especial-ly in an album review. Some catch terms 
you would expect to see for a mastcrpicce Ii kc 
this include: noise, spontaneous yelps, rock, 
poundi ng drums, crushing sounds, noise, rock 
and noise-rock. These labels arc certainly fun 
and do feed the starving writer that gets paid 
by the word, but useless for the music itself. 
After all , music is tile ultimate abstract expres-
sion, and high-quality music can he the most 
abstract. The problem with abstraction, how-
ever, bcc;omes the inaccessibility of the very 
ideas the music rries to convey. Lighming Bolt 
understand this issue very well. 

Their last album, Wonderful RilillbO'W, was a 
stunning work of riff rock blended with high

Hypennogic MOlmUlill starts with the familial' 
rhythmic monsrrosity of Rninbow, bllt takes a 
sharp turn with the beginning of the fourth 
track. 'l1le band delves into ambient rribal-
ism that blends with the heavy riffing. The 
polar combinatiun of ambient and rock are 
unstoppable. 'Ib add to tllat, Lightning Bolt

insrrumcnrs; yes people, there is sbl'edding

It is with sadness that We watch the continuing efforts of men to solve their problems with the methods of 
the past. These problems are many 
and relate to the future as much as to 
the present. In the main, they are 
relics of the past and represent a 
heavy burden for the burgeoning 
societies of today. Lost in their 
fierce battle for markets, 
governments everywhere try all the 
standard ways to achieve security 
and strength , development and 
innovation, and stability in the midst 

The word .is the sound of right-
eousness, it is the sound of truth. The 
word brings all men together, and 
builds the Brotherhood of men. The 
word sits lightly on the heart, bringing 
happiness to all. The word is wise and 
generous, filled with love. The word is 
sharing, the key to the future. 

When men learn to share they will 
know the meaning of life. When men 
share they will feel exalted and love 
what they do. Sharing will make men 
whole. Sharing will make man One. 

of change . It is an impossible task. 
There is but one answer to all their 

troubles, one solution to all their 
problems, yet none , so far, has 
ventured to whisper the word which, 
at a stroke, would free them and the 
world_ Which, at one stroke, would 
launch this world into the new era of 
Righteousness and Truth . Let the word 
resound, let the word demonstrate the 
new civilization, the new society. Let 
the word be heard everywhere; let 
man respond. 

Sharing is the answer to all men's 
problems. Sharing is another word for 
divinity. Sharing initiates the highest 
that is possible for man for it opens 
the door to trust. Sharing will take men 
to the feet of God. 

There, is no end to the concept of 
sharing. It will prove the salvation of 
men. 

When men see Maitreya they will 
hear these words of Truth. They will 
listen . to His pronouncements with 
wide-open hearts, and, responding, 
will call for the end of tyranny and 
injustice. They will gather around 
Him and He will be their 
spokesman. Soon, men will see His 
face. Soon, He will present His 
ideas to the world and usher out the 
old age. 

He is near men now. He cannot be 
denied. His love now saturates the

'Hodgins: Runner hopes to 
tum professional after colJege 

continued from page :lO 
role and does not let her success 

,get to her head. The other senior 
Tritons help with the less experi-
ence<l runners too, so the team will 
need a new hero after graduation 
this year. 

"r think [ am a big part of the 
team, but [ am also one of six senior 
girls, so T Ic:now a lor of them have 
a lot of impact on [the younger 
girls]," Hodgins said. "It's going 
to be a hard loss for the team, but 
they'll regroup and be oleay." 

Hodgins has faith in the future 
'of the cross country team becau e 
of rite leadership of 14th-year head 
coach Ted Van Arsdale, winner of 
the 2005 CCAA Coach of the Year. 

"[ have a very good relationship 
with Coach Van Arsdale," Hodgins 
said. "He's a very good listener and 
he'll never ask you or tell you that 
you can do something if he doesn'r 
think you can do it. He's not going 
to tell me 'T think you can go out 
there and win Nationals' unless he 
thinks I can do it, which is some-
thing that r work really well with 
because llc:now he believes in me." 

Despire her good relationship 
with her coach, Hodgins stressed 
the importance of self-motivation 
for success in running. 

"1 think you do need the guide-
lines in place, but the team has to 
want to do it, and no coach can force 
anyone to do thar," Hodgins said. 
"You [have] to want to do it yourself 
and you [have] to get those people 
within the group who have influ-
ence over other people. Bur defi-
nitely the coaches do help because 
the structure has to be there." 

The combination of the struc-
ture put out by the coaches and the 

ded~cation put forth by the run-
ners was the key ingredient to the 
Tritons having their best season 

in program history. However, with 
success comes questions about the 
future of the program, and when 
any Triton team does as weU as the 
cross country runners did in 2005, 
discussions will arise about push-
ing UCSD out of the Division IT 
spectrwn. However, according to 
Hodgins, the NCAA level at which 
the Tritons play is not an issue. 

"Running is different than a lot of 
other team sports because we don't 
compete one-on-one," Hodgins 
said. "J can go to a race against IS 
girls from 15 different schools and 
half of them could be D-I and half 
could be D-1I1. So, for the running 
program it doe n't really matter 
what divi.sion you are because we 
get the same competition no matter 
what division you're in." 

Although Hodgins does not feel 
that a D-J promotion would be 
helpful to the cross country ream, 
she did express an interest in the 
other debate concerning UCSD 
athletics: scholarships. 

" I Hke the irlea of equal scholar-
ships for everyone," Hodgins said. 
"But when I came here, I liked it 
thar everyone was here because they 
wanted to be here, not because they 
had to be here for scholarships." 

Hodgins is currently train-
ing for the upcoming track season 
before an early graduation. Then, 
Hodgins must decide how much 
effon she wants to put into continu-
ing a career in running. As of now, 
Hodgins, an anthropology major, 

. said she is interested in running for 
"ar least the next few y~rs." 

"1 will probably run and try to 
get sponsored by a pro team and 
hopefuUy [ will get an internship or 
a job with a museum doing research 
or a nonprofit organization trying 
to help underprivileged children," 
she said.

Graduating cross country star races toward next obstacle 
All-American Mimi Hodgins prepares for real world after seasons of anchoring Tritons 

Billy Wong/Cuardian 
Best foot fotward: Senior runner Mimi Hodgins ended her Triton cross couritry career 
by leading UCSD to a seventh-place finish nationally, the highest in program ·history. 

By IAEL ENTEEN 
Sports Editor 

Mimi Hodgins ran 80 miles a 
week in preparation for a strenuous 
2005 cross country season that saw 
her team make program history with 
a seventh-place finish at the NCAA 
Division 1I Championships. The 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior's 
dedication to the UCSD athletics 
program during her four-year career 
led to her consistently impressive 
finishes and her leadership role on 
the team. 

Hodgins and five other seniors 
led the women's squad of 20 runners 
into this season after a 17th-place 
national fini h .Iast year, but came 
away with a record-setting finish in 
this year's championships. Hodgins 
attributes the 10-spot increase to 
the team's closeness and work ethic. 

"We really worked on trusting 
each other and working and practic-
ing together really helps us change 
the dynamic of the team," Hodgins 
aid. "We did adjustments in train-

ing ... and a lot of our girls run at 
the same level, 0 they got to train 
together, which is really helpful." 

But Hodgins is not the same as. 
most other runners and ran sepa-
rately on many occasions for more 
intense physical training. The long 
hours at the gym have paid off, 
improving Ilodgins' 128th-place 
finish at the championships in her 
freshman year to tlle o. 23 spot 
he landed this year. llodgins said 

that her overtime work through tlle 
years accounts for the improvement 
since her first year. 

"I obviously ran a lot more, a lot 
harder," she said. "1 went from run-
ning 45-50 mile a week to 80 miles 
a week. You JUSt get tougher and 
learn how to race." .

No Cup

Angie Lin 

I f every movie is important enough to warrant its own soundtrack, and your life is 
more important (and longer) than 
any film , doesn't it cern inevi-
tablc that the question, "What is 
the theme song to your life?" will 
come up sooner or later? Whether 
it's Digital nderground's "Freaks 
of the lndustry" or the Guns and 

RO~l!s' " \Velcolllc to the Jungle," 
If you can think of J rune that 
de fine~ your 18-plu~ years of exi~­
tenee I am thorough Iy impressed. 
"or ~()lIle it's not so easy. 13 'cause 
tha t proved to be too daunting a 
tast.., I cheated and found a n~ore 
t:lci le que,tion, then ~ifred through 
numerous iPods and radio stations 
to find the theme songs of a few 
major sports. 

You may have to usc your imagi-
n~tion for some, and others seem 
III he just right, but hey, [ screened 
through all the songs' about cheat-
Ing on your baby's daddy and self-
hatred to bring to you "The Theme 
Songs of Sports." 

ational Ilockey League -
Metallica's "Master of Puppets." 
What's more fitting · than crown-
ing the most hardeore sports with 
a song from one of the best rock 
bands of all rime? Yeah, ( don't 

know either. No sport ha more 
physical fights, more morphine-
injecting, die-hard athletes or a 
more cut-the-crap attitude, and 
with lyrics like, "Taste me you wil l 
see/More is all you needIYou're 
dedicated toll-low I'm killing you ' 
ii's hard to imagine anything other 
than "Master! Master!" ringing in 
your ears before you deck a guy and 
spend time in the penalty box. 

Professional Golf Association 
- Britney Spears' "Sometimes." 
By no means am I poking fun at any 
hardcore golfer, but the lyrics just 
speak for themselves on this one; 
"Sometimes [ run": Docs this sport 
get any faster than 10 miles per 
hour on a golf L'art? "Sometimes 
I hide": \ \'here has Tiger Woods 
been recently? "Sometimes I'm 
scared of YOU';: I lave yOU ever tried 
driving a 'golf cart with a golf ball 
being hurled at you: I guess that's 
hO\\ Britney was feeling when 
she sang this wonder. ~d golf-
ers ~hould feel espccially proud tor 
hm;ng heen crowned with thc only 
female ~inger to grace this list. 

:'\:ational Basketball A.ssociation 
- Opio's "'Ta lk Dirty." You'll have 
to take this song out of it's " lets get 
it on" context, but it's a good match 
for the nation's biggest trash-talk-
ing sport. Lf you've ever played a 
hard game of streetball or if players 
had mics on the court, it seems 
as though half of them are ask-
ing for some trash-talking, thus: 
"Why don't you talk dirtyll really 
don't mincVTale a little rime, to the 
max we climblLet me Irnow what's 
on yo' nasty mind. n With a good, 

smooth beat in the background, 
Opio brings us a song that flows 
just as well as the ball and smaek-
talking do on the court. The song's 
sexual innuendos can't be fur from 
what happens off the court either. 

National Footba ll League 
- Disturbed's "Down with the 
Siclrness" This is one .of the most 
adrenaline-pwnping, catchy songs 
to hit the airwaves in awhile. With 
verses like, "There is no turning 
back nowlYou've woken up the 
demon in me," it's got an "in-your-
face" attitude that makes you feel 
like you can take on the world take 
some people out ... Or just pretend 
you're Ed Hartwell taking out a 
few pillows in your living room. 

Iso, amid suggestions of DMX's 
"Ruff Ryders nthem" and Tupac's 
"I li t 'Em p," this was also the 
one song whose lyrics that could be 
printed here. 

1 ational Rugby League - Keak 
Da neak's "Super llyphy." This is 
a tribute to tlle Bay Area; just like 
the sport, this song is awesome -
hut like the sport itself; it's also so 
mst-paced you kind of know what~ 
going on but not really. Keak's 
raspy voice raps hard with a catchy 
tunc that'll make you disregard the 
fact that you don 't really Irnow 
what he's saying - ju t like the way 
you just can't peel your eyes away 
from the TV's slow-motion instant 
replay when a guy gets taken down. 
Rugby'S a sport that we all love to 
watch, but only an elite few are 
hardcore enough to play - and for 
that I crown them with this one-of-
a-kind song. 

Hodgins is obviously a quicl~ 
learner; her finishes in the play-
offs paint an impressive running 
resume. 

At the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association C hampionships 
in San Francisco on Oct. 22, 
Hodgins finished first ' overall to 
give the Tritons their second CCAA 
title of all time. In the NCAA West 
Regional, the next leg of the race 
en route to the D-II title, Hodgins 
shined again, finishing first overall 
in a field of 146 to advance the 
Tritons to the championships after a 
second-place ranking in the NCAA 
West. 

"I'm proud of Regionals because 
[ kicked my own ass to win that 
race," Hodgins said. " I really 
struggled to win and in the [CCAA 
Championship) I just went out there 
and ran great, but no one was there 
[behind mel . In Regionals, [ actually 
had to fight for it, which makes me 
more proud of it." 

With all of the success she had, 
it's no wonder that Hodgins is one 
of the most decorated athletes at 
UCSD. She earned AJI-CCM hon-
ors as well as the Triton Racer of 
the Year award for her junior-year 
performance. This year she was 
crowned CCM Runner of the Year 
and took the CAA Div. 11 West 
Regional Title and says she docs not 
mind the constant pressure stem-
ming from her track record . 

" I do like trophies," I [odgins 
said. "[t's rewarding to get them, 
but I'd put the s~me amount of pres-
sure on myself if 1 got them or not. 
Because [drivel is something within 
you, it's not anything that an award 
is going to justify, although they're 
nice to have." . 

Hodgins never dreamed of tro-
phies and awards when her parents 

decided to get an over-hyper young 
Mimi involved in something to get 
her out of a household of five other 
siblings. 

"My parents put me in club track 
when I was six years old and I just 
loved it and was always one of the 
best at it," Hodgins said. 

After developing an interest in 
running at a young age, Hodgins 

. joined the cross country and track 
teams at Malibu High School before 
being recruited to run at UCSD. 

Hodgins said he was excited 
to leave her high school team for 
college athletics because of the 
ski lls a young runner can gain from 
increased competition. 

"[t's good to be with people who 
are better than you because they will 
push you to be the best," Hodgins 
said. 

This season, [[odgins was the 
one who pushed her teammates by 
showing them what's possible if you 
work "40-plus hours a week" as 
Hodgins does. 

As a senior, Hodgins al 0 was 
chargcd with leading the younger 
nmners, as others did for her. 

"When I was a freshman, there 
was a girl named Audrey Sung, 
who was much in the place that I 
am now," Ilodgins aid." he was 
way faster than everyone else and I 
idolized her and [ remember look-
ing at her and sayi ng, 'Wow, r want 
to be like Audrey some day.' And 
it's funny because I'\'e acwally gone 
faster than her, but at the same 
time [ never could even think that 
I'm faster than her. nd now, I've 
noticed that things I say, the young-
er people emulate (them] ." 

Despite her obvious importance 
to the team, Hodgins knows her
