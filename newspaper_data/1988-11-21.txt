New 'Dry Rush' Policy 

Regulation to Take Effect in Spring 
By M. O'KEEFE 
Contributing Writer 

The Interfraternity Council 
(lFC) at UCSD pa sed a new 
"dry rush" policy on Oct. 31, pro-
hibiting the con umption of alco-
hol at any IFC sponsored ru h 
e ent . The policy will go into 
effect thi pring. 

Prior to this deci ion, there 
were no off-campu restriction 
on alcohol and alcohol-free rush 
events applied only within the 
confine of the campu . 

The idea of alcohol-free rush 
event was initialized by IFC 
Pre ident and Sigma Alpha 
Ep ilon (SAE) member David 
Fi h. 

According to Fi h, this has 
been the policy for all SAE 
members nationwide for the past 
two year , and the re ult have 
been very positive. 

Fi h believes that the quality of 
SAE rushe has greatly improved 
ince the institution of dry rush. 

Court Bars 
Censoring of 
Student Media 

AN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Public chool officials cannot 
censor student-written "under-
ground" new papers for writing 
the official fear m;ght be disrup-
tive or em barrassing, a federal 
appeals court ruled Nov. 18. 

In a ca e from Renton, Wash. , 
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals aId a U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling earlier this year, al-
lowing school officials to censor 
school-sponsored newspapers, 
did not apply to unofficial pub-
lications that were essentially 
"communications among stu-
dents." 

The underground paper in the 
case, produced off campu by 
tudents at their own expen e, 

contained article "which no one 
could associate with chool spon-
sorship or endorsement," said 
Judge Mary chroeder in the 3-0 
decision. 

"They are therefore not within 
the purview of the school' exer-
ci e of reasonable editorial con-
trol. The tudent di tribution of 
non- chool pon ored material 
... cannot be su bjected to regula-
tion on the basis of undifferen-
tiated fear of po si ble disturban-
ces or embarra ment to choo l 
official," hroeder said .

"Without alcohol , guys went 
[to rush] not to party, but to get to 
know the other guys. They felt 
that they were treated more fairly, 
more accepted, and it pulled peo-
ple together in more creative 
ways," Fish said. 

He added that , "When it came 
down to voting time, it was easier 
[for initiated member involved in 
the pledge selection proce ] to 
remember who people were." 

Fish also felt that dry rush will 
help build a solid foundation for 
UCSO's rapidly growing Greek 
sy tem, which now consists of 13 
charter member fraternitie and 5 
charter member sororities. 

"The direct results of dr rush 
will bring rush more on campus," 
Fi h aid. "With the Pub opening 
[for public use], fraternitie can 
hold parties there. Rush will be 
more accessible to freshmen who 
don't have tran portation and thi 
will help rush' publicity."

i hments must be trict for the 
policy to work effectively. 

The I FC has propo ed a range 
of puni hments, in which a fra-
ternity' fir t offense could re ult 
in a fine of up to $500.

rio i "not the type of image we 
want. " 

He want to" how the admin-
istration that [IFC members] are

"We want to work with the 
administration, not against them," 
Fish said. 

The campus I FC, which con-
sists of representatives from the 
13 fraternitie , is al 0 trying to 
prove that school administrator 
"don't have to govern us, we can 
govern our elve ." 

The I FC is till working on 
the possible consequence that 
fraternitie will have to uffer if 
they do not abide by the new dry 

A econd offen e may re ult in 
another fine, as well as a uspen-
ion from participating in the 

quarterly Sports Tournament spon-
sored by the IFC. In addition, 
fraternitie with two offense will 
be prohibited from holding ru h 
for that quarter and will be forced 
to eliminate any new pledge until 
the following rush. 

Finally. a third offen e could 
re ult in complete suspension from 
the IFC. 

A su pen ion would mean that 
a fraternity could not participate 
in any of the event pon ored by 
the IFC including orority 
exchange, the Sport Tourna-
ment, and specific ru h events.

The treaty calls for the United

According to Hayden, a UC 
scientist wa to blame for the 
over elling of the trategic De-
fen e Initiative (SOl or "Star 
Wars'') project to the Reagan 
Administration in 1983. 

He explained that Edward 
Teller, hailed as the father of the 
hydrogen bomb, reported to 
White House officials that the X-
ray la er, the main component of 
SOl, wa ready for the "engineer-

it wa not. 

Hayden aid that when Teller' 
colleague, Ro Wood ruff, voiced

unfairly reprimanded and de-
moted to a lower po ition at the 
Lawrence Livermore lab. 

Hayden acknowledged that part

I~ UC NEWS 
Students Protest Against 
Sexual Discrimination of Professors 

BERKELEY - Two recent cases of possible sexual 
discrimination have occured at UC Berkeley. 

Amid criticism that the School of Law has 
neglected to hire women and minority profe sors, 
Law chool faculty members voted to recommend a 
female profes or for tenure. 

Marjorie Shultz, who was denied tenure three years 
ago but has continued to teach at Boalt Hall, is likely 
to become the Law School's fourth tenured female 
professor. 

The Law School's recom mendation came two 
weeks after former Boalt profes or Eleanor Swift 
announced that an Academic Senate committee found 
that he may have been denied tenure two years ago 
becau e of her gender. 

The Academic Senate Committee on Tenure and 
Privilege, for the first time in the 50-year history, 
issued a prima/acie finding that enough evidence 
exists in the case to warrant a full hearing, according 
to Swift. 

The other case involves political activist and 
feminist Merle Woo, who will bring her two-year 
sexual and racial discrimination suit against UC 
Berkeley before a national arbitrator in Berkeley. 

Woo, 47, who was fired for the second time in 1986 
from her job as a full-time lecturer in the English 
department, charged the University with 
discrimination and retaliation on the basi of race, 
ex, exual orientat ion and political ideology. 

Woo said that her case is similar to that of Swifl. 
But because Swift was being considered for tenure, 
Woo said, their case a re being handled differently by 
the University. 

Students protested both ca es. early 75 UC 
Berkeley law students marched to Chancellor l. 
Michael Heyman's office Nov. 2 to demand he grant a 
"fair" tenure review of Swifl. 

Chanting ~Bring Swift justice," students stood 
outside California Hall while Coalition for a 
Diver ified Faculty representatives gave A sistant 
Chancellor John Cummins a petition signed by 600 
law students and faculty members demanding a fair 
and independent review of Swift's case. 

In Woo's ca e about 25 people picketed in fro nt of 
the University'S Labor Relations office Nov. 3, furious 
that UC Berkeley was delaying a hearing o n her 
discrimination suit.

chanted as they marched up and down the idewalk in 
front of the office. 

The Woo case was scheduled to be heard by a 
member of the American rbitration Association . 
Labor Relations Manager Debra Harrington said that 
beca u e of "workload and the flu," the University had 
to postjJone the hearing for a week.

UCSD Cancer Center Wins 
Top NCI Research Ranking 

First place score among 27 academic institutions 
competing for cancer research funding has been 
awarded to the UCSD Cancer Center by the National 
Cancer Institute's clinical investigation review 
committee. 

Approval and the topnotch rating in the "Cancer 
and Leukemia Group B"(CALGB) project carries 
with it funding of approximately $1.7 million over the 
next five years. 

The CALGB wa formed in the 1950s by the 
National Cancer Institute and a select group of 
research institutions to investigate a number of chem-
otherapy treatments just becoming available. The 
partici patory group then was able to conduct cooper-
ative studies, under NCI grants, which were not pos-
sible at any single site because of limited patient avail-
ability. The UCSD Cancer Center has participated in 
CALGB studies since 1970, conducting extensive stu-
dies in leukemia, lymphoma, breast and lung cancer. 

In this year's competition the UCSD Cancer Center 
program received a total score of 119, with the lowest 
score (100) being the best. The 26 other institutions 
ranged up to greater than 250 points, with the funding 
level cut-off at 190. 

Mark R . Green, M .D., director of the Cancer Cen-
ter and principal investigator of the CALGB study, 
said the award was based on the Center's academic 
excellence, active involvement by an outstanding 
group of community based oncologists and scientific 
contr-ibutions.

Research Fraud Policy Adopted THANKSGIVING By DARCY GRIFFIN 
Contributing Writer 

The adopt io n of a formal 
UCS D policy on reasea rch fraud , 
announced by Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson on Oct. 7, has provided 
persons witnessing plagiarism or 
other fraudulent research practi-
ce with specific guidelines to fol-
low when reporting suc h acadec-
mic misconduct. 

"Basically [the policy) tells a 

person who ees it ca e of miscon-
duct in research how to go about 
reporting it," said Assistant Dean 
of Graduate Studies, Jean Fort . 

" It comes from a lot of long-
standing policies at UCSD," Fort 
continued . " It brings together 
principles and ethics and tradi-
tions of honesty, like in other 
careers ... like the Hippocratic 
Oath in medici ne." 

The policy would not have a 
direct impact on undergraduate 
students according to Fort, but 

could have an effect on graduate 
students. 

"Misconduct is so rare that it's 
unlikely to really affect students. 
There have been very few allega-
tions of misconduct at UCSD," 
Fort said. 

One of the most publicized 
cases of research fraud at UCSD 
occured in 1985 when cardiac 
radiologist Robert Slutsky, at the 
School of Medicine, left the Uni-
versity after it was proven that he

UCSB Sorority Accused of Racism • Full cooked-to-order complimentary breakfast every morning 
By MICHELLE RAY 
Staff Writer. Daily Nexus 

SANT A BARBARA - Accu-
sations of racism have been di-
rected at Gamma Phi Beta soror-
ity by several members of three 
predominantly black greek chap-
ters regarding an event involving 
Gamma Phi Beta actives and 
pledges. 

Alpha K.appa Alpha members 
were alarmed about a Gamma 
Phi Beta big / little sister activity 
after they heard that th ree pledges 
were asked to dress in black, wear 
black face paint and participate in 
a mock slave auction at the event, 
according to Alpha Kappa Alpha 
president Kim Waters. 

Alpha Kappa Alpha members 
filed a complaint with Greek 
Affairs Activitie Adviser Patrick 
Naessens Oct. 28 concerning the 
activity between three Gamma 
Phi Beta actives and the pledges 
that took place Oct. 20, according · 
to Naessens . 

However, Gamma Phi Beta 
representatives insist that no such 
event occurred and those who are 
complaining do not understand 
the actual situation, which re-
portedly occurred at a pledge 
member's apartment, according 
to Gamma Phi Beta president 
Drea Juskaitis. 

"Three big sisters sent out noti-
ces to three of our pledges, who 
were asked to wear black clothes 
and make-up on their faces," 
according to Juskaitis . She said 
the make-up was not intended to

ImItate black persons, but was 
done in the style of American 
Indians . "We did not have a slave 
auction .. . They don't betieve us, 
and we have a hard time under-
standing that. 

"The purpose of the costumes 
was simply that it was near the 
Halloween weekend , and [the 
actives] wanted to get their little 
sisters excited for their revealing, 
which was the 21st, the next day," 
Juskaitis continued. "We did not 
realize that this was offen ive in 
any way." 

Since thtl original complaint, 
members of three predominantly 
black greek organizations - Al-
pha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma 
Theta , and Alpha Phi Alpha -
have met with members of Gamma 
Phi Beta, Naessens and Activities 
Planning Center Director Naomi 
Johnson to discuss the actual 
situation and what action, if any, 
should be taken. 

"I think what it came down to 
was that there was a difference of 
opinion about what was said and 
heard between two people," John-
son said. "And when it gets down 
to one person '5 word against 
another, it's a dead-end situation." 

Members of black fraternity 

and sorority chapters also pres-
ented their co ncerns on the situa-
tion at a regularly sc heduled 
meeting of Greeks for Racial 
Awareness and Cultural Educa-
tion on Nov. 3, where they asked 
the program's members to take a 
more active part in promoting 
racial sensitivity. 

"A lot of students feel that their 
intelligence has been assaulted 
because Gamma Phi Beta [denied] 
that it happened," Kim Waters 
said at the meeting. "I overheard, 
and my sorority sister overheard , 
some other gi rls talking about it. 
I've heard other people say it 
happened - so something hap-
pened. " 

Meanwhile, Gamma Phi Beta 
views the situation as "a minor 
incident that has been blown out 
to great proportions," J uskaitis 
said_ expressing surprise at the 
charges of racism. "We are one of 
the only predominantly white 
sororities that have had racial 
awareness programs ... A lot of 
girls are very sensitive about this. 
We feel like we're being accused 
of omething that definitely isn't 
true. It kind of pushes you off of 
your feet a lillie."

Medical Waste 
If the danger to the health of beach-goers and 

surfers wasn't so apparent , the reaction of the County 
Health Department to the now daily appearance of 
medical waste on La Jolla' beache would be 
laughable. 

They blamed the Navy. They blamed drug dealers, 
who were supposedly on boat tossing hypos over-
board . They blamed homele s people, who were sup-
posedly rummaging through medical tra h, looking 
for aluminum cans, hauling the unused wa te to the 
beach and dumping it. They blamed kids holding 
"drug partie" at night, even though most of the waste 
wa coming up at La Jolla Shore , which has no 
nighttime beach "drug parties" to speak of. 

The homele people and the drug user couldn't 
very well call a press conference and answer the coun-
ty' charges. ("This is the Crack Dealer'S Association. 
We're outraged at prejudice against our bu inesse 
.. .') , but the Navy did. and nailed the Health 
Department. 

All of this leave u with no idea as to where the 
waste i coming from and no clue as to how to stop it. 

The County Health Department need to shut its 
mouth . It needs to close any legal loophole that 
allow waste to be dumped at sea. (County Supervisor 
Susan Golding's publicity-seeking legislation that 
would stop doctors with under 220 pounds of waste 
from throwing it in the 'alley dumpster is a start.) 

Finally. the County, which didn't even ask life-
guards to collect the waste until last week , needs to 
devote some time, energy and attention to finding the 
source of the waste. Their effort has been poor 
thus far. 

Election Notes 
• A dirty as Michael Dukakis and George Bush got, 

they weren't half as bad as the candidates for a 
Georgia Congressional seat. One candidate, the incum-
bent Republican, was awaiting sentencing on money 
laundering charges . His Democratic opponent, chiefly 
known for his role on The Dukes oj Hazard, was an 

. admitted alcoholic and the possessor of an arrest 
record. The Democrat won. proving that not just 
Republican actors wear teflon coats. 
• CBS, as part of its exit polls, asked people in all 50 

states how t hey would have voted if Dan Quayle and 
Lloyd Bentsen were at the top of their tickets instead 
of Bush and Dukakis. Bentsen won in every state,

AS Meets to 
Cancel Meeting 
Editor: 

had nothing to say to the Council. 
Re-scheduling the meeting for Tues-
day would have been ideal. As it 
stands, the "Special Meeting" on that 
very same Tuesday will only deal with 
overriding the veto - then adjourn-
ment. No time for student input was 
scheduled. 

Ii hed in the Guardian. 
No rational person can fail to be 

appalled at Israel's behavior vis-a-vi 
the Palestinians over the last year. 
But there is an insidious lack of 
rational thought at play when a great 
fighter against the evils of the Holo-
caust is called a "hypocrite." Indeed. 
Wie enthal's demand that we learn 
from history is directly applicable to 
Israel today. 

A "Special Meeting" of the A.S. 
will be held tomorrow. There's reaJJy 
nothing special aboUl ihis "Special 
Meeting," scheduled by A.S. V.P. I 
Administration John Robison, other 
than the purpose of the meeting. 

In this case. it's to override my veto 
of Bill # 126, elimination of the Wed-
ne day A.S. Council Meeting. What's 
so peculiar is that the meeting was 
originally scheduled for tomorrow. 

Where is the Council going? And 
what is Robison doing for students? I 
hope the Council gives special con-
sideration to their objectives, direc-
tion and concern ~ hile on winter 
break. It would be really nice to see a 
change in all energies and efforts 
towards something constructive and 
beneficial to the Associated Students. 

But any analogy made between the 
attempted crushing of the intifada 
and the Holocaust is both inaccurate 
and obscene. The Holocaust wa a 
massive. well-organized attempt to 
exterminate all the Jel>. s of Europe -
plus other groups, such as homosex-
ual and gyp ie . It i a unique event. 
No other form of genocide comes 
close to its organization. I srael's police 
action against Palestinians. although 
tragic and brutal, in no way may be 
seen as genocide. 

Maynard Dimmesdale 
A.S. President 

The bill was vetoed because A.S. 
Council Meetings involve more than 
just voting and role caUs. It·s an 
opportunity for students to present 
their concerns before the Council as a 
whole. Even if there's nothing to vote 
on, the Council should be available to 
receive student input. 

Letters Do Not 
Do Us Proud 
Editor; 

Every meeting involves a variety of 
student expression to some degree. 
There has never been a meeting when 
students outside the Council have 

J am most disturbed by what I see 
as serious historical inaccuracies in 
two letters - "Wiesenthal Ignores 
New Genocide," (Guardian, Nov. 10) 
and "Israel Accountable for Hliman 
Rights," (Guardian. ov. 17) - pub-

There are elements of anti-semitism 
in tarring modern day Jews - survi-
vors of the Holocaust - with the 
brush of their Nazi oppressors. Are 
victims respon ible for the crimes 
done against them?

Q And A: What do you think the chancellor's job is and how well does he do it? 

I think the chancellor's job 
is to oversee all aClivities 
involved with UCSD. He's 
UCSD's voice 10 the commun-

word on all business Iransac-

Continued from pale 4 
folks. This train runs on time. K 

We rushed down the platform in a confused babble and arrived at 
the bigcavelike door to our sleeper - the last car on the train - with 30 
seconds to spare. I heard whi ties from up in front, and a roar of steam 
vents underneath. The Zephyr was pulling out. 

We were just settling into our Deluxe Bedroom Companment on 
Car No. 3530 - adjusting the bunks and the shower head and the 
typewriter table by the big picture window - when I realized that we 
were, in fact, not alone. There was a ratty old suitcase in the room that I 
didn't recognize, and also another person. 

It was Madden 's friend. He'd moved smoothly into the compart-
m~nt and pulled the cunai n closed behind him. "Jesus Christ, man," he 
saId, as he at down on the end of the bunk . "You sure as helltrave1 
heavy. I thought we'd never get all this stuff aboard." 
. I smacked him on the side of the head and he suddenly ",ent all to 

pIeces. 
"Please." he blurted . "Don't turn me in. I have to be in California by 

tomorrow, or they'll revoke my parole." He slumped on the bunk and 
began sobbing. "I'm sorry I lied to you," he moaned . "But I had to get 
out of town . They were after me - and besides, you looked like a 
Raiders fan ; I thought you would be on my side." 

I s.hook m~ head sadly and reached into my Spanish leather kit bag, 
coming up WIth a small plastic tag from a long-ago conference of the 

Natio~al Dis~rict Attorneys Association, which occurred in Las Vegas, 
ev., In the tIe of Richard ixon . It said, "Thompson Hunter - Los 

Angeles. C ." Underneath the name was a small, five-pointed law-
man's badge, with silver cales in the middle . 

The wino went instantly wild when I showed it to him. "You lying 
bastard," he screamed. "I knew there was something wrong with you! 
You're a cop! You were nevcr a friend of John Madden . He wouldn't 
do this to me." Then he leaped sideways off the bunk and grabbed for 
my bottle of C hivas. 

A brief scuffle ensued, then the steward. Frank Thompson, arrived 
with a rope. I had no choice. We had him taken off forcibly by railroad 
dicks in Naperville, still cur ing me for betraying what he called "the 
spirit of the RaIders." 

OPINION 

EDITOR 
IN 
A 

Box 

Ediror in a Box appears every Monday wrjllen by a different 
Guardian editor. 

By JULIE MUN RO 
Features Editor 

Every time the words "I don't 
eat mea t"come out of my mouth, 
J wait for the inevitable question, 
"Why not?" 

I think that if everyone knew 
how the meat on their table got 
there, a lot more people would be 
vegetarians. So, here it comes, my 
fully detailed, gung-ho vegetarian 
sales pitch. 

Fir t of all, I did not cut out 
meat just for my health. The 
health factor did not hurt, but I 
eat and drink a lot of otherthings 
that are pretty unhealthy. 

The main reason I avoid meat 
whenever politely possible is be-

cause I think the way pigs, chick-
ens, etc. are raised and butchered 
in today's mainstrea m farm is 
wasteful and inhumane. In ot her 
words, ethics. 

Large, modern, competitive 
farms often treat animals as inan-
imate objects in order to cut costs. 
The animals are cas trated, brand-
ed, overfed, denied exercise and 
sunlight, and transported long 
distances before being slaught-
ered . 

Chickens are kept in spaces 
that frustrate their natural behav-
ior. They are unable to scratch the 
ground, build a nest, or even 
stretch their wings. Their beaks 
are cut off to keep them from bit-
ing and eating each other, as t hey 

The UCSD Guardian 

~ometimes d o in their stressful 
environment. 

Pigs arc placed in pens small 
enough to prevent them from 
turning around so they put on 
more weight and, therefore , in-
crease the farmer's output. 

Calves are taken from their 
mot hers at birth and put in one 
and a half feet wide by fo ur and a 
ha lf feet long stalls . T hey are fed 
nonfat milk and growth promo-
ters until they reach an unnatu-
rally bloa ted weight (four times 
t heir normal) so that they can't 
even stand o n their own. They are 
then slaughtered for their high ly 
prized veal. 

Aside from this mi erable treat-
ment in life, descri ptions of the 
brutality of slaughterhouses is 
enough to bring me to tear . 
S pi kes are slammed through the 
skulls of sheep, the throat of 
baby calves are slit , and pigs are 
moved on conveyor belts to be 
electrocuted with high-powered 
stun guns. Some animals simply 
die from fright. 

I am pain ting a grim picture 
and presenting only the most hor-
rible aspects of animal farming, 
bu t it is these aspects that explain 
my refusal to suppon the meat 
producing industry. 

Another aspect of animal farm-
ing is detrimental to both the 
animals and those who eat their 
meat. Farm animals contract var-
ious diseases, from pneumonia to

consumpt ion anyway. Diseases 
such as undulant fever, parasites. 
salmonellosis and many others 
can be passed from animals to 
humans.

In addition, the hormone, 
a ntib io tics, insecticides and tran-
quilizers given to livestock arc 
also passed on to humans who eat 
meat. Meat is also closely linked 
~i!h hean diseas~ and cancer. 

Many people who see the po-
~ential i.mprovements in a vegetar-
Ian socIety may feel that one per-
son cannot make a difference. but 
they should realize that the aver-
age American ate 300 pounds of 
meat in the year of 1983, or up to 
90 animals. So, one person can 
make all the difference in the 
world to 90 animals in just onc 
year. In addition, vegetarians have 
had greater longevity, endurance 
and mental health throughout 
history.

HA YD EN: A lieges Improprieties at Labs 
Contipued rrom page 1 

"Star Wars ca n be reasonably 
defended in terms of research. It's 
the kind of weapon many Ameri-
cans like,"he said. "It's the perfect 
weapon for TV because it's a 
graphic. " 

The California Legislature ap-
proved Hayden's budget proposal 
earlier this year, which called for 
the allocation of more funds to 
appuint oversight officials to the 
labs. 

He said the Regents have been 
less than cooperative in complying 
with the legislation and have called 
for a study to examine the need 
for revamping over ight proce-
dures . 

At a hearing to be held at UC 
Berkeley on Dec. 12, the Regents 
are expected to present their 
findings . 

According to Hayden's propo-
sal, the purpose of oversight 

should be to en ure objective 
research, free inquiry, and protec-
tion orthe right to dissent, as well 
as the existence of di sentingviews 
within the scientific comm unity. 

Julia Silverman, Hayden's as-
sistant , explained that the budget 
proposal mark the first time that 
the California legislature has 
intervened in the history of the 
labs si nce they were established in 
the I 940s. 

Silverman la beled this inter-
vention a "first step" in increasing 
oversight of weapons labs and 
further stated that such a step is 
"an important one." 

Hayden said that he is "sympa-
t hetic" to those who feel the 
University should sever its ties 
with the labs. 

"The lab will continue to be an 
enigma to some, an embarassment 
to others, but [will remain] a fact 
of life," he aid . 

When asked who should run 
the labs if the University did not, 
he replied, "I don't know what is 
the best way to handle any 
bureaucracy that does secret re-
search on nuclear weapons. I don't 
know where on this earth it should 

.be located ." 
Hayden's interest in the labs 

was sparked when he was a college 
student at the University of Mich-
igan . 

He told students that he hitch-
hiked across the country to UC 
Berkeley, where he contacted 
Teller and interviewed him for hi 
college newspaper. He said he 
was quite stunned to learn that 
the UC was involved in weapons 
research. 

Hayden said that most students 
are probably unaware that the 
most chilling research performed 
in the nation ;s done under the 
auspices of the Uc. Assemblyman Tom Hayden

R ULIN G: Court Bans Censorship FRAUD:Policy Adopted 
Continued from pale 1 
tional, but it noted that school s 
retained the power "to punish 
students for unacce ptable or dis-
ruptive conduct after it occurs." 

The court ordered the Renton 
School District to remove letters 
of reprimand that it had placed in 
the records of five Lindbergh High 
School students who wrote a four-
page newspaper called Bad Astra 
and distributed it at a senior class 
barbecue in May 1983. 

The paper criticized some 
school administration policies and 
contained a "mock teacher eva-
luation poll" but did not include 
any "defamatory, obscene or com-
mercial material," the court said . 

The students were reprimanded 
under a district policy, adopted in 
1977, which required all material 
that was written by students for 

distribution on campus to be 
submitted to chool officials for 
'prior approva l. 

Under the policy, principals 
could ban material that was obs-
cene or libelous, invaded the pri-
vacy of others, was "inapprop-
riate to the maturity level of the 
students" or could cause "signifi-
cant or substantial disruption ." 
The court said school officials 
acknowledged that they would 
have approved the newspaper if it 
had been submitted to them. 

U.S. District Judge Carolyn 
Dimmick upheld the school pol-
icy, saying it was justified by the 
potential disruption that could 
result from student writings dis-
tributed without official screen-
ing. But the appeals court dis-
agreed. 

Schroeder cited the Supreme

Court's language in 1969 when it 
rejected a high school 's attempt to 
forbid protest armbands during 
the Vietnam War: "Undifferen-
tiated fear or apprehension of dis-
turbance is not enough to over-
come the right to freedom of 
expression. 

"This policy, with its censure of 
students for failing to present 
unobjettionable material for re-
view, is the product of just such 
an eundifferentiated fear' of dis-
ruption," Schroeder said . 

"Interstudent communication 
does not interfere with what the 
school teaches," Schroeder said. 
" It enriches the school environ-
ment for the students ."

Coadalled from pale 3 
had falsified his research. ac-
cording to an Oct. 28 Los 
Angeles Times article. 
Although Fort said this case 
brought a "heiahtened aware-
ness" of research fraud to 
UCSD. she added that "With 
2,000 people involved in re-
search, the fact that there have 
been only one or two cases of 
fraud shows it's not a major 
problem. 

Fon stated that the policy 

provides for complete confi-
dentiality of both accuser and 
accused 50 careers and per-
sonallives aren't damaged as a 
result of alleptions. It also 
provides time limits so the 
allegations will not drag on. 

If the accused is proven 
guilty, then the policy gives 
provisions for discipline, even 
thouah no specific disciplinary 
actions are outlined in the pol-

Greenpeace Vessel Tours San Diego Bay 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Guardian Intern 

I t is a boat that ha been in hot water. literally and figura-tively . It is Greenpeace's ketch 
Vega which arrived in an Diego 
Nov. 9. its final stop on an inter-
national voyage to promote de-
nuclearization of the oceans. 

Greenpeace is a non-profit inter-
national organization which 
focuses on the issues of toxics, 
ocean ecology, and nuclear dis-
armament. The organization laun-
ched its Nuclear Free Seas (NFS) 
campaign in July 1987. 

Greenpeace used its world-wide 
network to campaign against 
naval nuclear weapons, and to a 
lesser extent, sea-based nuclear 
reactors . NFS served to expand 
upon and unite local and regional 
efforts in their international cam-
paign. It ha targeted t he five 
nuclear navies of the world : the 
United States, oviet Union. Uni-
ted Kingdom, Chi na and France. 
Combined, these navies po ess 
16,000 nuclear weapons, about 30 
percent of the world' total nuclear 
arsenal. 

The Vega , a Canadian vessel, 
et ail for the Pacific onhwest 

from the warm waters of Auck-
land, ew Zealand in August 
1988 for a three-month NFS 
campaign tour. Heading south 
from Vancouver, British Colum-

bia, the ega concluded its Pacific 
Coast "lour in an Diego. 

In advocating denuclearized 
waters, the 38-foot ega has come 
in direct conflict with several 
countrie . 

In 1972 it was rammed by a 
French ship while protesting that 
country's atmospheric nuclear 
weapon testing in the outh 
Pacific. The French government 
took the Vega and her crew into 
custody after the vessel was ram-
med. 

An Australian police boat ram-
med the Vega a second time dur-
ing a 1987 N FS protest of the 
entrance of the USS Ramsey, a 
U.S. warship carrying nuclear 
weapons, into Australian water-
ways. At the end of this month, 
the seven crew members will stand 
trial in Australia for this incident. 

A fundamental concern and 
motivation of many NFS cam-
paign worker is that naval nuclear 
weapons are not subject to arms 
control. As published in the FS 
campaign briefing. "the auto-
nomous, mobile. invisible and 
secretive nature of the navies has 
helped them elude arms control. 
There are no significant controls 
on naval nuclear armaments." 

San Diego is one of the two 
largest homepons in the U.S . and 
a center of naval activity. 

Based here are over 100 navy 
ships and several submarines car-
rying a total of roughly 350 

Student Finds $1,170 
in Peterson Hall 

By JULIE SONNTAG 
Guardian Intern 

W hat would you do if you had $1000 in 
cash? I'm sure you 

can think of something to spend 
it on . A shopping spree, that 
great C. D. player you saw last 
week or that mountain bike 
you've been begging your par-
ents to get you for two years. 
Marcello Paoletti thought of 
many of these thing on Friday, 

ov. 4 when he found $1,170 
in an envelope under a desk in 
Peterson Hall. 

"I was [thinking] new mags 
for my car, dinner out every 
night for three months. [I was) 
thinking of all the great things 
[I could do like] flying home 
[to the Bay area) and back," 
Paoletti said. 

He found the money and 
paycheck stubs of Phuong . 
Le when he was collecting his 
belongings after a midterm. 
Later Le told Paoletti that she 
had tried to buy a used car that 
day, but didn't have enough 
money. That's why she was 
carrying so much cash. 

Paoletti said that he forgot 
about the money on Friday 
and remembered it again Sat-
urday morning. 

"I didn't know what to do 
about it , so I'm thinking about 
ethic and thinking about God 
and the whole thing. And am I 
going to go to hell or am I just 
going to forget about it?" he 
sa id . 

He decided to return it. 
Paolelli said his motivation 

for returning the money was 

his "thinking of her. It being 
her own money and her ha ving 
to work [for it]. And just hat-
ing it so much . I mean, I 
wouldn't miss it. If I wa to 
keep it, I would probably spend 
it on something stupid like my 
car or something, and she could 
have needed it for school ... I 
thought about how I would be 
so psyched if someone gave me 
back that much money." 

Molly Aleunder/Guardian 
He did not get a reward , 

Paoletti said , but "she thanked 
me about 100 times." 

Everybody asks, 'Didn't she 
give you a $20, didn't she give 
you something?' That son of 
defeats the purpose .. . of giv-
ing the money back if you 
expect something for it. If I 
had really wanted something I 
could've ... given her half of it 
back. Tile whole idea [that] I 
should have gotten something 
is kind of stupid," Paoletti 
explained. 

Even though he did not get 
to keep the money, Paoletti 
did have some fun with it 
because it looked ~o funny. 
And played tricks on my [other] 
roommates. You know, had it 
coming out of ears, out of our 
noses and out of our pants,"

nuclear weapons, according to 
Greenpeace data. In addition, a 
storage site and a nuclear wea-
pons training group are located in 
the San Diego area. 

Greenpeace's disarmament cam-
paign coordinator Karen Topa-
kian and orne of the Vega crew 
took reporters on a press tour of 
San Diego Harbor aboard the 
Vega, identifying some of the 
many nuclear-capable ships dock-
ed in the harbor. 

Topakian explained that San 
Diego was visited by the Vega 
because it presently needs an 
increased public awareness of 
nuclear threats at sea "more than 
any other community." 

Emphasizing the broad scope 
of the FS campaign's efforts, 
she added that it is "important to 
realize that Greenpeace is not 

pointing at San Diego and saying, 
'You guys are the only bad guys.' 
We have to move to the areas that 
have [nuclear weapons at sea, 
which is) another consideration 
for why we are here." . 

Whether a certain ship is carry-
ing nuclear weapons at any given 
time is undisclosed Navy infor-
mation. The U.S. Navy's public 
policy is to neit her confirm nor 
deny t he presence of nuclear wea-
pons aboard its ships. However, 
based on information from former 
admirals and commanders, Green-
peace has inferred that nuclear-
capable ships are usually nuclear-
carrying ships, a concept Topa-
kian believes dangerous to public 
safety. 

"I think we're all at risk when 
we live in a community that has 
these kind of ships here and has 

those nuclear weapons on board 
and has them stored in the 
bunkers," said Topakian. " It is a 
dangerous situation for all of us." 

There is a sizable segment of 
society that disagrees with Topa-
kian's claim and Greenpeace's 
quest for nuclear disarmament. 
One such individual, UCSD stu-
dent Joe Cassar, believes nuclear 
weapons serve as a means of pre-
vent ing nuclear war. 

"I am opposed to total disar-
mament because the main part of 
the U.S. deterrent is the fact that 
we have nuclear weapons which 
keep the Russians in check," Cas-
sar said. "What deters war is the 
completeness and integrity of the 
U.S. defense. Without these wea-
pons, all leverage is lost in dealing 
with the Soviets, and their spread

Nobel Laureate Writes Book 
on Discovering DNA 

By JONATHAN HEALY 
ConrribU/ing Writer 

Nobel laureate Francis Crick, 
one of the co-discoverers of the 
double helical structure of DNA, 
was on campus at the UCSD 
Bookstore last Tuesday, where he 
signed copies of his new book, 
What Mad Pursuit: A Personal 
View of Scientific Discovery. 

In 1962, Crick shared the Nobel 
Prize with James Watson and 
Maurice Wilkins for their dis-
covery. 

Crick di cllssed the significance 
of this discovery. "D A is what 
genes are made of. and genes are 
essential for all living things." 

"The structure of D A ... 
directly carrie information essen-
tial for development of characters 
in any single organism," said 
U SD biochemistry professor 
Dr. Paul altman. 

DN A or deoxyribonucleic acid, 
is found in the cell of all living 
creatures . Each molecule of DNA 
is double tranded , with each 
strand consisting of a phosphate/ 
sugar backbone, to which a erie 
of bases are attached . 

It is in the sequence of these 
bases that the genetic information 
is contained. If a DNA molecu le 
is viewed as a sentence, then each 
individ ual base is a single letter in 
that sentence. 

Regarding his book, Crick said 
"the book is about some of my 
experiences d uring the classical 
period of molecular biology, from 
the late 19405 until 1966." 

I n the book, Crick describes 
how he became interested in 
st udying the structures of com-
plex biological molecules while 
working at Cambridge in the late 
1940's. At Cambridge healso met 
James Watson , who was "deter-
mined to discover what genes 
were. " 

During this period, Crick not 
only discovered the structure of 
DNA wit h James Watson, but 
later worked with several others 
to decipher the universal genetic 
code. This involved explaining 
how D A could direct cellu lar 
growth and function, by control-
ling the synthesis of protein . 
These are essential components 
and regulators of cell activity. 

These discoveries composed "a

of communism would continue." 

Cassar applies si milar reason-
ing to his defense of sea-based 
nuclear weapons. 

"Having nuclear warheads at 
sea only adds to the completeness 
of the U.S. deterrent because 
[nuclear weapons at sea) are 
mobile and have a greater chance 
of not being destroyed by a sur-
prise attack," Cas ar continued.

she said . 

NFS campaign workers are 
anxiously awaiting the January 
release of the third publicatron in 
the "Neptune Papers" series. The

accidents, Cassar responds, "I can 
still justify nuclear weapons at sea 
... look at the amount of acci-
dents there have been involving 
conventional weapons. Accidents 
happen in chemical plants also, 
yet they are needed too." 

Topakian acknowledges some 
positive results of the Inter-
mediate-range uclear Force 
(I F) treaty, the major nuclear 
reduction treaty of recent years, 
she sees irony in its execution.

All in all , Cas ar feels that "to 
get rid of nuclear weapons would

have so many more conventional

" Primarily, I believe in a nuclear-
free eanh as a whole," said student 
Amity CUller. 

"Beginning with our oceans, we 
should be panicularly conscious 
of the need to protect them and 
the life in them," continued Cut-
ter. "[The oceans are] resource 
and environmental elements th·a.t 
we need to protect, not to turn

Labeling nuclear weapons "a

that was totally revolutionary in 
the science of biology," Salt man 
aid , 

At the front of Crick's book is a 
quotation from Osca r Wilde 
which reads: "Experience is the 
name everyone gives to their 
mistakes." 

Commenting on this, Crick 
added that the book is "partly 
about the lessons tha t we can 
learn from the mistakes we made." 

T he book provides li ttle new 
information involving the discov-
eries made, Crick said, but it gives 
his perspective of the somet imes 
incorrect theories and speculation 
which preceeded the discoveries. 

Science is described not only as 
an accumulated body of know-
ledge, but as an ongoing process 
by which scientists acquired under-
standing. Salt man agreed , noting 
that science is a human, social 
endeavor. 

In an early chapter, Crick des-
cribes the basic pro blem molecu-
lar biologis ts faced in t he late 
194Os: understanding the mecha-

nism behind inheritance. 
It had long3ince been observed 

by Charle Darwin, among oth-
ers, that characteristics could be 
passed (inherited) from one gener-
a t io n to the next. The laws 
governing this in heritance had 
been identified by Gregor Me n-

Francis C rick's dis-
coveries composed "a 
period of scientific devel-
opment that was totally

the heritable material, called 
genes, were located on bodies 
called chromosomes which were 
found in the nuclei i of cells. There 
was also strong evidence that 
genes were made of DNA.

D A, according to rick, must 
first explain how the molecules 
can replicate them elves, In addi-
tion, this process must continue 
indefinite ly, meaning the new 
molecules (which result from this 
replication) must also be able to 
replicate. 

A model must also explain how 
genetic variation, required for 
natural selection, could arise in 
nature. Lastly, any model would 
have to be con istent with the 
known laws of genetics. 

The model propo ed by Crick 
and Watson in /954 met all these 
requirements. It has not only with-
stood the te t oftime, but, accord-
ing to Salt man, has served to 
"simplify and unify the science of 
modern molecular biology." 

In 1976 Crick moved to San 
Diego, where he works at the Salk 
Institute. He is currently involved 
in research on the brain, studying 
the action of a neurotransmitter 
called glutamate which is related 
to memory.

like to know "what is the explana-
tion of conscious ness."

PHIL OS ANALYSIS ... This is a much bigger game 
than most people think, because the loser will have a very 
difficult time reaching the playoffs. Both teams, who own 
6-5 records, know that a victory tonight is crucial for their 
playoff chances. The 4gers have had a history of choking in 
the big ones, and in recent years, have not been all that 
successful in Monday night games. If Washington .:oach 
Joe Gibbs opts to start Mark Rypien, who is currently 
top-rated among NFL quarterbacks, it could spell trouble 
for Frisco. But don't count on it . Gibbs is stupid enough to 
start Doug Williams, whose Super Bowl performance last 
year was a tola/nuke. And even if he doesn 't , the Niners are 
not going to let the season slip away this easi ly - certainly 
not with a loss to the Redskins (of all teams). Phil says . . .

with others to deny IBC any 
opportunity to get back into the 
game, recording several blocks, 
kills and service points. 

Dannevik explained his changes 
after the game: "We were at a cer-
tain tempo and we needed to 
change. We put in quicker people. 
I had a hunch and I went with it. 
This day it was a lucky hunch." 

" I thought we could have won 
it in the fourth ," claimed IBC's 
Dimatteo, " I'm proud of my team. 
They gave it everything they had ." 

They had nothing for the final 
game, as UCSD "Served BB's 
and blocked great," according to 
Dannevik, Dana Simone once 
again led the serving barrage, 
recording eight consecutive points, 
including two aces. "It was nice to 
be a ble to serve where I wa nted it 
to go, which I haven't been able to 
do lately," she explained later. 

Two aces in a row from Klint-
worth could n't have proved a 
more fitting ending to the match. 
The Tritons cruised all seaso n 
and the drive came full circle and 
concluded at the same enjoya ble 
pace. 

The tournament wa a land-
mark in many ways. UCSD was 
the first NCAA volleyball team 
on any level to win three con-
secutive national championships, 
and the first to win five overall. 
To that Dannevik smiled, "The 
best part about it is that we'll be 
better nex.t year because our young 
players developed so well. " 

It aiso 'marked the first time 
ever that the NCAA tested for 
drugs in the women's Division III 
volleyball National . According 
to Athletic Director Judy Sweet, 
the result will take about a week, 
but the findings will have no bear-
ing on the teams' finishes, only on 
individuals. 

Pam Walker, the chairperson 
of the NCAA Division III 
Women's Volleyball Champion-
ships, acknowledged that this was 
the best tournament ever, and the 
student help was outstanding. 

The only question remaining 
after all was said and done is 
where they are going to hang the 
latest banner in the gym. The 
lea rn is so ucces ful that they've 
now overflowed their corner. Dan-
nevik joked, "That 's a nice prob-
lem to have." 

Triton Coach Doug Dannevik was 
often on the edge this weekend 
- but he got his point across as 
UCSD came from behind in suc-
cessive nights to win the National 
Title.

Undefeated Men's Soccer Defies Odds in 1-0, 3-0 Victories 

ritons Take 
ITOW 

Staff Writer 

The CSDTritonmen' occer 
team captured the CAA Di i-
ion III ational Title aturda 

with a 3-0 ictory over the Ro-
che ter In titute of Techno log at 
Rochester. In the proce ,the Tri-
ton etanumberofprecedent in 

an Diego sport . 
The Triton became the fir t 

team in UCSD hi tory in any 
sport to fini h a sea on unde-
feated. ending with a 23-0-2 rc-
ord. 

The became the fir t men' 
team at UCSD to capture a 
national champion hip. Women' 
volleyball ha won four title and 
women' tenni two. but no men' 

team had done 0 until aturda . 
They became the fir t collegiate 

occer team in an Diego to win a 
national ti tle. UC 0' women 
advanced to the AA Divi ion 
I I I final la t weekend but were 
beaten 1-0 by William Smith on 
penalty kick. an Diego tate ' 
men' tcam advanced to the 

CAA Division I finals one year 
ago but could not get b Clem on. 

With temperatures hovering 
around 40 degree and the wind 
chill factor dropping it even 
fu rther, the Triton had trouble 
getting their high-powered cor-
ing attack going. The were unable 
to find the back of the net through 
90 minute of regulation pIa. and 
two 0 ertime in both their semi-
fi nal matche against Mes iah Col-
lege of Penn ylvania - a game 

ationals in New York 
they ultimately won 9-8 on penalty 
kick and almost 45 minute in 
their champion hip match. 

But the oung bench bailed out 
the Triton in the final game. 
With 16 econd remaining in the 
fir t half, fre hper on Mark Mel-
nik scored a brilliant goal on a 
pa from cott Rommel to give 
the Triton a 1-0 edge and turn 
the game around. 

Up to that point , it had been a 
hard-fought defensive battle and 
UCSD' frustration at being 
unable to find the back of the net 
wa building. But according to 

rmstrong, "That fir t goal really 
picked everyone up. Our confi-
dence ju t oared and I felt the 
game wa in our hand ."

Tritons Win Two Titles on Same Day 

Count 'Em: Three Straight Titles for UCSD 
By DANA CHAIKE 
Slaff Wrtter 

All ea on long the Triton ' 
theme wa the "Drive for Five" -
a drive for a fifth National Title in 
the women's volleyball team's hi -
tory. The road to the ational 
wa well-paved and straight for 
the most part. but thi weekend 
the road pre ented itself with orne 
100 e gravel and na ty curve. 
forcing UCSD to hift into high 
gear to attam their third straight 
a nd fifth . ational Title overall. 

In a certain sen e. the "Drive 
For Five" actually became the 
"Drive in Five" as both matche 
drove the Triton to the limit 

efore they captured the title. The 
champion hip match, in which 
mo t expected UCSD to weep 
by Illinoi Benedictine College 
(IBe. 36-6) in three games. re-
qUired the Triton to come back 
from the brink of losing for the 
econd night in a row to pull out a 

14-16, 15-6, 6-15, 15-10. 15-2 
victory. 

UC 0 Head Coach Doug Dan-
ne ik de cribed the match a 
"gut-wrenching, nerve racking. 
and totally draining - emotion-
ally. mentally, and physically. The 
whole night i a blur." A slow-
motion replay of the weekend 
drive. or rather roller coa ter ride. 
through the tournament might be 
the only way to get a feel for the 
overall inten ity. 

On Friday night. unranked 
Juniata College of Pennsylvania 
posed quite a roadblock for the 
Tritons in what Dannevik cre-
dited a "the be t Division III 
match we've had since 1984." 

The Indian managed to score 
the fir t point of the match before 
UCSD took over and used solid 
middle blocking to tally five 
straight points, and eventually 
lead 10-6. JUniata' tough, quick 
defen e got it back into the game, 
hutting down the Triton for 

eight ideouts while regaining the 
lead 12-10. UCSD rr.istakes, most 
made becau e the timing between 
etter and hitters was vfL gave the 

game away 15-12. 

K~n Rein I~in/ <iuardian 
Junior Diana Klintworth (4) was selected as a first -team Ali -American 
thiS year 

While the Indian committed 
j u t about every type of mi take 
to tart the econd game, SO 
took advantage and led 13-7. The 
Tri ton mu t have been watching 
their opponent too clo ely and 
began making the same mistake. 
Juniata denied the home team 
a ny point on four opportunitie 
a they reeled off eignt point to 
take the game 15-13 and the match 
lead 2-0. 

Juniata Head Coach Larry 
Bock claimed. "Our game plan 
wa to create mismatche . We did 
that in the first two games, but in 
the long run, UC 0 made the 
adju tments [it] had to make." 

Dannevik. who labeled the 
match a tactical one, conceded . 
"The rea on we got down i 
because Juniata played outstand-
mg. They were well-prepped for 
u . They eemed to know every-
thing we were going to do." 

He continued. rea oning wh 
he saId he was not worried that 
his team trailed by two game. 
"!t' very difficult for any Div-
i ion III team to play at our level 
of intensity for two and a half 
hour. They can play great for an 
hour. or the eq uiva lent of two 
games. 

"That's the way I coach, for my 
players to go the two hours. 
They're trained to hang in there 
and not get down on themselves. 
As long a we u tained our level 
of intensity we'd be okay, and 
the only que tion was how long 
Juniata could keep up [its] level 
of play." 

T he answer was not any longer 
than the hour he described. The 
team battled their way to four 
ties before UCSD took charge 
and a 7-6 lead on a ervice ace by 
All-Tournament team member 
Diana Klintworth. 

Juniata managed one more 
point, before Rachel Vetter, also 
named to the All-Tournament 
team, copied Klintworth with an 
ace of her own that pelled the 
beginni ng of the end for the vi i-
tors . 1 he 1 ritons fini hed the 
game 15-7 in a flouri h wit h a kill, 
a dink , and a block from sopho-
more Becky Palmer.

Dannevik concurred, "Juniata 

played a defen e we hadn't seen 
all year. and it took us a while to 
adapt. We started to set behind 
the setter to our middle and out-
side hitters. 

"Laurie [Bertanyi] wasn't sharp 
the first two games, but she et 
beautifully in the last three," he 
praised . 

Game four patterned game 
three with several tie, the la tone 
at 7-7. The Tritons combined 
Juniata errors with mart dinks 
and well-placed kills into open 
space by Bertanyi, Klintworth, 
Ellen hi , and Elizabeth Tan to 
run out the game 15-7. 

" he third and fourth games 
were the key. We had the match-
up we wanted, but we didn't take 
advantage. They served tough and 
it was lights out from there." Bock 
admitted . 

"Tough"i n t a trong enough 
word for how the Triton ' played 
in the final game. B th teams

dle . , ophomore Dana imone, 

who played with a taped hand, 
erved at will as UCSD extended 

a 4-2 lead to 12-2 with eight con-
secutive points . The Indians , 
rather weary at this point , 
mounted a minor omeback, 
before falling 15-5. 

"This was a great comeback 
tonight. There were a lot of heroes 
out there. Ellen Chi off the bench 
sparked us and gave us a lift with 
her excellent serving and passing. 
Elizabeth Tan and Becky Palmer 
got tuffed early, but they kept 
a pproaching and Laurie Bertanyi 
got them the ba ll. 

"This was a great victory for 
volleyball on campus. There i no 
doubt that the crowd pulled us 
through," Dannevik claimed. He 
added, "There i a home crowd 
advantage, but we're not relying 
on it." 

He mo t certainly tried not to. 
Maybe he wa uperstitiou about 
having won all his champion hip ' 
on the road , or that th host team 
had won only one time in seven 
tries, but he had hi tea m sta ing 
in a hotel. "We're dOing ever -
thing together as, team, a~ if we 
were on t he road."
