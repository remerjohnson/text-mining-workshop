Academic Senate's meeting at 
3: 30 pm. Students and faculty 
filled the lecture hall during the 
one hour discussion which 
touched upon only two of the 
issues which were to be looked 
at, according to Saxon's 
outline. 

No recognizable .decisions 
were made, and the meeting 
was interspersed by the 
droning of students cbanting in 
the outer ball and by personal 
bickering between Saxon and 
members of the UCSD faculty.

News Editor 

In what amounted to an 
essentially token appearance, 
VC President David Saxon 
attended the UCSD Academic 
Senate AS meeting yesterday 
afternoon and conducted an 
informal discussion with 
Senate members. 

Saxon's visit to the campus in 
1975 led to a turbulent anti-CIA 
demonstration by students and 
th e president subsequently 
found it necessary to leave the 
campus before addressing the 
AS. 

Saxon said, "Do you 
think It's. P8mralty 
In my character?" 

Echoes of the fruatration that 
students found in Saxon's 
evasive manner of .peech when 
he addresaect them two yean 
ago on the IYIIl .tepa were 
heard in ye_relay'. meetiq 
by the attempt. of facult, 
memben . to obtain a tenable 
responH to the questioa of, 
:ovhat some people flad to be, an 
Inequitable allocation of 
research fuDda to the van 

support an .averalin& 01 fundi 
to a common level throughout 
the UC system. "No one would 
argue that this was sensible. 
Good management is not 
across the board allocation." 

He did not accept, however, 
the proposition of a faculty 
member to establish a ' policy 
statement to recognize the 
inequitable situation and to 
work toward alleviating the 
problem. 

Saxon finds bimseU limited 
Saxon was markedly defens-

ive about. his milk -toast 
approach to the issues facing 
the UC system. " The pqwers of 
the President are very lim-
ited " he stated, adding that he 
felt confinement in his position. 

UCSD faculty expressed 
their long standing objection to 
the library plan which they teel 
will d~prive them of adequate 
research materials. The plan 
calls for UCSD to ship a total of 
582,000 books to storage 
facilities at UCLA and UCB by 
1988. 

"Nobody's tryinl to put you 

down," said Saxon . " Wby 
shouldn't I want to be a hero? 
Do you think it's a perversity in 
my character? " 

Saxon views UCLA and UCB 
as more established than UCSD 
and the six other UC campuses. 

In the story, "one 
thing led to another 

d " an 000 
Commenting that " The Re-
gents have made it clear that 
they will not fund nine 
collections like those two 
libraries ." He said that 
acquisition would actually drop 
·if the plan were not implement-
ed, tlue to the exponential 
increase rate of the library 
budget. 

Never clearly defined ' were 
what Saxon termed the "sym-
bolic" and " substance" issues 
involved in library planning.

need for enough resources with 
which to conduct a graduate

Outside: students "let 
him know we still care" 

by Mark Stadler 
While UC President David Saxon spoke to a standing room only 

audience at the Academic Senate meeting in USB 2622 yesterday, 
about 40 people demonstrated loudly and peacefully against him 
ollts de the ~ga(hering . 

The people, who included students and non-students, were 
mainly concerned about UC investments in the apartheid state of 
South Africa , university involvement in nuclear weapon 
production and new, stricter UC admissions policies, according to 
literature distributed at the rally. 
_ The rally was called "to let Saxon know that some people know 
what he's doing (about those issues) and still care," one 
demonstrator said. 

The turnout of 40 protestors w.qs important, the demonstrator 
said, because Saxon had not announced he would be at the senate 
meeting until last Friday. 

" We' re letting him know he can't get away with trying to sneak 
in here," the demonstrator said. 

The rally started on Revelle Dlaza but the demonstrators soon 
moved to a position just outside USB 2622. From that point, their 
chanting and clapping was quite evident to people inside the 
senate meeting. 

At one point, several of the demonstrators knocked on a side 
door to USB 2622. Saxon, according to observers in the meeting, 
paused momentarily, but did not acknowledge the demonstrators' 
presence. 

Two years ago, Saxon met with students face-ta-face in a 
question-and-answer session, before he was scheduled to :neet 
with the senate. At that time, his answers to questions concerning 
UC ties with CIA were considered evasive and unsatisfactory by 
some. students, who followed him to the senate meeting and 
entered it, en masse .

ROBERT N. HAMBURGER, 
M.D., Professor of Pediatrics 

sends Toombs 
tumbling 

In reviewing the Sex Pistols 
(via their album), Mike l 
Toombs has displayed· much 
more understanding of the 
band than is usually given. But 
he still falls very short of 
understanding the context or, if 
you really want it, the move-
ment. 

As Is popularly held lately 
this column ia not the place to 
promote politics or political 
movements, so I won't . 
However, the main point Is that 
the Sex Pistols are Punk. Call it 
Punk, New Wave, or even 
Devil ' s Spawn as they 're 
reportedly beginning to do in 
the Midwest, the Sex Pistols 
are it. 

The review implied that the 
Sex Pistols are uncompromis-
ing (evidenced by their music). 
This is entirely true an d 
because of this, the Sex Pistols 
would not stand for being called 
"a great rock 'n' roll band, but 
paradoxically ... (not) con -
cerned with sex . " The only 
paradox in this case is calling 
the ba nd rock 'n' roll ; Pun is 
anti-rock 'n' roll and anti-sex. 
Punk is straight rock because it 
is a departure from all the 
cereb ra l ( pe r t he " R ock 
Dreams" definition) bull that 
rock 'n' roll has evolved into. 
Once this is unders tood, it can 
be seen that the context (and in 
a way, the basis) of the review 
is e n t ire ly wrong , ma king 
m a ny sta te ments not only 
e r r on eous , but a l so non-
applicable. 

As for Glen Matloc k, he 
fa nc ie d him se lf a y ou ng 
McCar tney a nd wanted to steer 
the Sex P istols toward becom-
ing another Wings . What better 
reason for a New Wave band to 
sack a member?

Germany's ".Flve Ea,.Y Pieces" 
-"Kings of the Road" opens tonight at the Unicorn 

by Ted Navin Barke 
Coa&rlbllUq Edl&or 

Some American fIlmmake~ 
in the late sixties and the eariy 
seventies discovered existen-
tialism as a tbeme that bad yet 
to be grapbically explored in 
our expansive, go-get-'em 
culture. In llearchlng for an 
appropriate analo~ tor the 
subjects' recurringldeaa-
radical alienation, cultural 
dislocation, muted emotional-
ism, radical redefinition of the 
characters througb creative 
commitment - they landed 
upon the oniy suitable symbol, 
the Super Highway. These 
.. road movies, .. besttypified by 
Bob Rafelsons' Five EalY 
Pieces and Monte Hellmans' , 
Two LaDe Blacktop (and worse 
so by Dennis Hoppers' self 
consciously hip Easy Rider) , 
used the highways that criss 
cross our country as a sprawl-
ing, rambling metaphor to 
ill uminate the meaningless; 
ness of twentieth ceotury 
existence, a metaphor that 
randomly illustrated an age 
where the rapid acceleration of 
change had taken romance and 
purpose to modern life, and 
which showed people clinging 
to vague hopes. 

The principal characters in 
the two films , a classi c al 
pianist in Pieces running away 
from a bogus family life in 
search of something more 
beatific, and a trio of youth 
culture washouts in Blacktop 
whos' dropping out leads them 
to a life of aimlessness while 
they drive through the Midwest 
in a souped up Chevy , serve as 
exa mples of those whQ ' ve 
caught on to Life's Big Lie. 
They realize that existence is a 
walking shadow of false 
assumptions , and in their 
discovery lies a bleak fate of 
uncertain wandering. They' re 
una ble to find a credible 
alternative to what they've left 
behind, are unable or unwilling 
to come to terms with the root of 
their psychic exile, and are 
doomed to travel the highways, 
town to town, experience to 
experience, unable to establish 
themselves anywhere, coming 
away untouched and unmoved. 

Ge rman director Wim 
Wendors' new film Kings of &be 
Road (In lbe Course of Time, 
the original German title) 
takes up the notion of the 
" road" film, but expands it to 
investigate ideas that Rafelson 
and Hellman glossed over. 

Kin,s commences with 
a lte rnating shots of Bruno 
Wi nter and Robert Lander . 
Br uno ,i s a traveling film 
projector repairman wllo 
drives a bulky Industrial truck 
that he lives in. Robert. shown 
dr ivi ng recklessly through 
small German villages in a VW 
bug, is a pediatric researcher 
running away from a failing 
marriage. When the two finally 
meet, Bruno Is parked beside a 
lake readying for a shave. He 
spies Robert careening down 
the road and who In a half 

~earted suicide attempt, races 
Into the lake. Bruno watches 
with a bemuaed grin as Robert 
sits at the wheel of the hall 
submerged car. Robert finally 
makes an escape tbrouJh the 
Sun roof, and with suitCllse in 
hand, he swim. to shore, to be 
g r eeted by Bruno. Bruno 
makes note of Robert's sopping 
clothes, and makes a crack 
about his shoes, "They squeak, 
huh?" They both laoO. As the 
situation dictates, S'nmo hal 
little other ehoIce tbaD to give 
RQbert a Wl. 

From tIdI point, Wenders 
~gins a penetrating investiga-
tion into bls characters. Bruno, 
Crom first auumption, Is the 
burly manife.tatlon of self 
reliant man who consciously 
model s himself after the 
American ideal of the ruqed 

..... \ \, . 

Individual. He wears American 
farmer overalls , and plays 
American rock and roll on a 
portable record player, and 
sings the lyrics in English, most 
signUicantly, "King of the 
Road," a "man of means, by no 
means .. . " But under this , 
revealed in his growing 
relationship with Robert , 
there', a brooding sense of self 
isolation, rife with the uncert-
ainty of someone who's cut 
himself from some unknown 
tunnoll and seeks to immerse 
himself in a false sense of 
security by self reliance . 
Undernea th the veneer , 
however, the conflicts still 
rage, and Robert , who ' s 
problems are more or less 
upfront, forces Bruno to deal 
with emotioins he thought he 
had cast aside . Robert's 
faltering attempts to establish 
a relationship as the two of 
them continue their aimless 
trek through the German 
countryside makes Bruno 
uneasy. He must now deal with 
a human being, and at times 
reveals himself that make him 
uneasy, insecure and anxiety 
ridden. 

This comes to a head in one 
beautifully played scene . 
Bruno and Robert wind into a 
town where they must repair a 
PA sy stem for a kiddie 
matinee. Bruno, on a ladder 
behind the movie screen , is in 
the dark and complains that he 
can ' t see anything. Robert , 
seeking to help, screws in a 
huge stage light that projects 
their magnified shadows unto 
the screen. The kids, who are 
noisy and restless while a 
beleagured theatre manager 
tries to quiet them, see the 
shadows and take iUo be part of 
the show, and show their 
approval. Robert begins to do 
some ' pantomime , a.nd a 
confused Bruno lets loose of his 
tightly controlled emotions and 
joins in. The two playa series of 
cartoon vignettes, culminating 
in buffoonish violence. The kids ' 
in the audience cheer these 
escapades. 

Later, the two stop at a road 
side snack stand. While eating 
his meal, Bruno confesses that 
he hated Robert for making 
him act the way he di(l , forcing 
him to lose his control and 
succumbing to the spirit of the 
moment. It's apparent that 
Bruno had built his life to be 
predicated on nothing more 
than isolation, and that he's 
unable to handle the complex-
ity of frieridship. 

Towards the films ' conclu-
lion, Bruno's notion that he's 
:be sum total of the American 
lffectations is more or less 
lispelled. He and Robert are 
lrun~ and driving at night 
Nhen they come to the border. 
'We can'tgo any farther," says 
Bruno. They stop the truck, get 
Jut and discover a barracks 
ronnerly occupied by Ameri-
can soldiers. The walls are 
covered with graffiU, with the 
names of men and the ciUes 
Uley come from, as well as a 
!Jeerningly endless Une up of 
girlie pin upe, . 

In the dark, the only light 
coming from candles, the two 
drink, sing lyrics to Country 
and We.tem songs, read the 
American cities on the wall, 
and talk In sporadic bursts. 
Robert f1nd1 a phone, connects 
it to a wire 10 that he miaht call 
his distrau,bt wife , but 
connects to the American 
operator. He laugha , and 
declares that "The yanks have 
colonized our subconscloUl." 
This remark Is the tip of( for 
Bruno. He Is less the American 
type he -thougbt himself to be. 
The American road, with It's 
mytholo.lcal freedom and 
,bQuBdless horizons , are not 

part of his culture. He's come to 
the border, he cannot drive any 
further. His rootlessness has 
taken him only so far, and 
having reached the physical 
and psychological limitations 
of the road, he can only double 
back to places he's already 
been. After a somber talk about 
women - Bruno desires 
women but he refuses them 
accomodation because of an 
intense loneliness he ultimately 
feels each time he makes love; 
Robert has run from his wife, 
but calls her persistently for 
fear that she may commit 
suicide without him - they 
badger each other for each 
other's bogus motivations for 
running away. At this time 
Robert decides that they both 
must confront the t hings 
that've sent them into flight. He 
leaves the next morning while 
Bruno is still asleep , and 
catches a train to his home-

town. In the final sequence, 
Robert is shown on the train 
while on the road paraliel 
there's Bruno's truck. The road 
veers off at a fork , and the train 
and truck go their ways. Bruno 
sees Robert through the 
window and gives a smug 
laugh, and then once again 
sings " King of the Road." Of 
the two, it seems that only 
Robert can return to give his 
life another try. Bruno has a 
failpre of nerve despite his self-
realization, and re t renc hes 
himself deeper into old ha bits, 
hoping to bury the uncertainty 
under a ffectation. 

Kings of the Road lasts 
nea rly three hours but Wen-
de r s ' d irec tion m a kes i t a 
seamless, effortless voyage. 
His black a nd white pho to-
graphy, with their wide open 
exposition shots of the ter rain, 
ma tter of fact tonality in closed 
in sequences, a nd a casually 

perusing eye for detail , capture 
the stark clarity and bone bare 
resonance of J ohn Steinbeck's 
better prose, and conveys the 
redundancy of life on tV«! road 
while relieving the tedium , 
much of which is supplied by 
the laconic 'country blues of 
Axel Liodstadts' musical score. 

The acting is appropria tely one 
note, with Wenders a llowing 
Rudiger Vogler (Bruno) and 
Ha nns Zischler (Robert) an 
imp rovisa tiona l lattitude to 
create situations of awkward 
silences, bana l repartee , and 
odd mome n ts of f rantic 
behavior. We nders ' random 
sample approach to the scenes 

• creates an elliptical , almost 
poetic cadence, a loose fitting 
structure that allows the ideas 
and questions to emerge from 
th e act ion rather than be 
didactly pasted on through 
dialogue and speeches .

"Black Oak" boogies for toJLSPQt 
... and after Lynyrd came ... .Jhn 

Tim Mackenzie 
Ar1s Editor 

As Dave Weir and J were on our 
way down to the Hanalei Hotel to 
talk with Jim Dandy Mangrum, I 
kept trying to tell myself that he 
was now part of a new Black Oak_ 
No more B.O.A. Just B.O. 

How could Jim Dandy be 
different than he was with the old . 
band? That would have to compare 
with Ritchie Blackmore denounc-
ing self-indulgent rock 'n' roll and 
running off to Tibet to become a 
Buddhist monk. Stay calm, I told 
myself. Don't go in with any nasty 
preconceptions about Ozark rock 
stars. 

By the time I had left his hotel 
room, I had been thoroughly 
charmed by this Southern gentle-
man. Jim Dandy indeed. He was as 
happy as a rooster in a henhouse 
with his new band, which consists of 
guitarists Jimmy Henderson, Jack 
Holder and Greg Reding with Andy 
Tanas on bass and Joel Williams on 
drums. " The music is at a new 
level," J .D. said proudly. "We have 
more ammunition now," referring 
to Black Oak's blistering three 
guitar lineup. 

After some more obligatory 
discussion about music and the new 
band, we delved into one of his , and 
my favorite subjects. Women. " I thi~k a lot of women like the fact 
that -I'm married, " confessed the 
thrice married rocker. "I am a 
provider. I'm a symbol of freedom, 
potency and virility." He added 
that he knows so many women 

.... dOH 
acros the country that he "was 
beginning to feel selfish." 

Later that same day, I sat in my 
seat after the close of Black Oak's 
set feeling completely ravaged by 
their" ammunition." The band may 
be bucking for the top-spot in boogie 
rock, left vacant by the Lynyrd 
Skynyrd tragedy. The band fires off 
more guitar licks than even the 
Skynyrd's could muster, with Jim 
Dandy. prowling about the stage in 

. 

his inimitable I>()(I'UE~OC)()ile-bc" 
style. I slept well 
that some things never 
change.

"The religion of the pianoforte is still with us," writes Donal 
Henahan of th~ New York Times, "in the person of Ursula 
Oppens." 

The Avery Fisher Prize winner, whom he went Oft to call 
unquestionably one of the most accomplished younger pianists, 
will lead off the UCSD Scholarship l"'lano Series on Nov . 30, at8 pm 
in Mandeville Auditorium. 

Oppens is among a truly select group of pianists who play new 
music and old with equal insight. In the :trea of the avant-garde, 
Speight Jenkins of the New York Post called her " virtually a 
genius." She plays with insight; her technique is beyond compare. 
Percussive without banging, she can make fierce dissonances into 
something less than noise. " 

San Diego audiences will hear Oppens in the kind of repertoire 
that has earned her reputation. Pierre Boulez's First Piano Sonata 
will begin the program. When Oppens played the composer's 
Second Sonata at Alice Tully Hall, Jenkins wrote that "she played 
as though she'd writte.l it. A remarkable pianist." 
. The evening wil also feature a work by Frederic Rzewski _ 
"The People United Will Never Be Defeated" (1975). Oppens has

from the press. "This is Miss Oppens' kind of music," wrote the 
New York Times' Harold Schonberg. 

Oppens will round off the recital ith the Sonata in A flat major,

"one should not go to hear Miss Oppens for the laughs or the pearly

Ruu Haffertamp used every player in eacb of the four games. 
In a 9-3 victory over Cal State Los Angeles, Dan Ebyu tallied five

saves.

Nine Tritons scored, including one goal by Alei, who played

Bowl Games Set 
Hafferkamp told his players at the outset of the season if they 

worked hard, they could win at least half of their games. In a 
telephone interview yesterday morning, Hafferkamp said he was 
both pleased and surprised with his team's performance. "With 
nine freshmen on the roster, I thought we'd be in for a toulh 
season, but the guys played their hearts out. I'm looking forward 
to next year." 

Men's A Punts remain uribeaten -
Much of the success of this season's team can be attributed to 

Alei AI one of only two seniors on the team, A lei • s netminding was 
su~rb all season long and his three years of previous playing 
experience helped the younger players in many games. If there 
was a small college All-American team, UCSD's Bob Alei would be 
tbe number one goalie. 

After a 6-5 start UCSD won ten o( its last 12 contests, with the 
only setbacks co~ing at the hands of fourth ranked Pepperdine 
(which defeated third rated UC Irvine over the weekend to win the 
PCAA title) and tenth ranked University of Arizona. The highlight 
of the season, though, had to be the 10-7 nod over San Die~o State on 
Nov. 9, It was only the second time ever that the Tntons h.ave 
beaten SDSU.

Bookthieveswill haveittough 
by Alan Russell 

EdUor 
In the past, some people at 

UCSD have found money in 
books, but we 're not speaking of 
authors. 

We' re talking about thieves, 
At the end o( each quarter 

UCSD's bookstore has tradi-
tionally had a " book buy-back" 
wherei n it purchases used 
textbooks. 

Un fortunately , a no ther 
" tradition" has grown up with 
the bU'y -back , that of the 
stealing of students ' books and 
their subsequent sale back to 
the bookstore. 

"At the end of last spring 
quarter we had our worst rash 
o( complaints ever over stolen 
books," said Carl Hurley , 

Demonstratlon •. o '

Sax on left that meeting 
before his scheduled address 
and took a wayward walk to 
Matthews campus. On that, 
walk, he was followed by a . 
group of students, who con-
tinued to question him on UC 
policies. 

That anti-CIA demolUltratioD 
resu lted in disciplinary 
hea rings called by Chancellor 

~1n E lroy, against ten UCSD 
SiJUents. 

Yesterday, the oniy studentS 
Saxon saw were the handful 
who reserved some of the 21 
no n-senate member seats 
inside the meeting. 

As the rally yesterday 
continued, the demonstrators 
were watched by uniformed 
and plalnclothe* campus police 
officers wbo, as they have at 
past rallies, took pictures of the 
demonstrators. , .

Manager of the bookstore. 
" Ther e were a numbe r of 
people who r epor ted books 
stolen from all areas o( the 
campus, from the libraries, 
from eating places, from all 
over." 

Realizing that the situation 
wasn' t gOing to improve by 
itself, bookstore officials hit 
upon a method they believe will 
curtail the textbook thieves, or 
at least " give the academic 
community some protection:' 

" Basica lly we've set up a new 
procedure for those people 
selling books bac k ,·' sa id 
Hurley . "Now we will ask (or 
some identification in the (orm 
of a driver 's license and a 
s tudent identification ca rd . 

When asked why the pictures 
were taken, one officer said, 
•• Just in case something beyond 
a peaceful demonstration 
develops. " 

In addition, officers were 
stationed at each entrance to 
USB 2622. All the doors to the 
room were locked. 

After the demonstration 
ended, but before the senate 
meeting was over, several of 
the demonstrators tried to 
enter the room. Although they 
said they had made reserva-
tions , to attend the meeting, 
they were barred by campus 
police chief Hugh French and 
senate aide Cheryl Rogers, who 
told the students they should 
have been inside the meeting 
before It started. 

Several professors were let 
into the meeting after it 
started, aDd after the students 
were denied entry. 

Those selling the books to us 
will be s igning in on a number 
line with the same number 
recorded on the books sold to 
us. IJ 

Books can be traced 
What happens then is that if 

people report a stolen book and 
then identify it at the bookstore, 
the book can be traced back to 
the seller, "The information 
will then be turned over to the 
campus police," said Hurley, 

With the next book buy·back 
Dec. 7, 8, 9 and 10 and on the 
south-end porch of the book-
store, officials are waiting to 
see the results of the new 
system. 

" What we wa nt to do is 
protect the people who have · 
paid for their books," said 
Hurley, "By instituting this 
procedure we hope it will make 
those books Sitti ng a r ound 
campus not so attractive to a 
thief. " 

Hurley pointed out that, "A 
person who plans to steal and 
then selrthe books will have to 
identify himself in a very 
visible manner. 

"My feeling is that there's not 
enough money in a used book to 
take such a chance."

Fusion: .trying to build the bottle 
by Alan Nilsson 

Staff Writer 
How does one build a bottle to 

contain a plasma which is 
hotter than the interior of the 
sun? For fusion reactors that do 
not rely on the laser scheme 
explained in a previous article, 
the answer to this question is of 
critical importance. 

The boUle battle 
The plasma must be con-

fined, because fusion cannot 
take place unless the nuclei can 
collide energetically. If steps 
are not taken to maintain the 
plasma density, too few nuclei 
will fuse. Material containers 
must not be used, for they 
introduce impurities into the 
plasma and limit the attainable 
plasma temperature. 

To keep the plasma isolated 
from the walls of a fusion 
reactor, the properties- of 
magnetic fields are exploited. 
A magnetic field can exert a 
force on a moving ion. The force 
does not induce charge 
separation as an electric field 
would. Applying some fairly 
basic physics, one can, in 
effect, build a magnetic bottle 
for the plasma.
