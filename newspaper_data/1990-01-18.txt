A.S. Rejects Proposal 
To Revise Constitution 
By MARY BETTY HEARD 
Staff Writer 

The A S. Council heavily 
debated the Resolution Call-
ing For A Constitutional Con-
vention, submitted by, and 
eventually withdrawn by AS. 
President John Ramirez dur-
ing last night's meeting. 

After a contested vote of 8 
for, 11 against Ramirez with-
drew the resolution before a 
revote could be taken. 

The debate over the resolu-
tion concerned the timeline 
proposed for the convention 
process. 

sessions. Larry Becker, however, 
felt that the chairman should be 
entirely neutral, during and out-
side of sessions. 

"I really think we should make 
it clear [in the resolution] that the 
Chair cannot support a 
constitution in any situation," said 
Becker. 

The resolution was finally 
amended to say "neither the Chair 
nor the Vice Chair shall step down 
to argue for or against any 
constitution at any time during 
the session. Nor shall either the 
Chair or the Vice Chair submit 
any constitution in his or her 
name." 

The A. S. Council has now 
begun discussing whether to at-
tempt the Constitutional Conven-
tion again within their term, to 
mandate that the next Council 
hold a convention, or to find 
another solution. 

VOLUME 69, #5 

These Cub Scouts joined many UCSD students in Monday's 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade in San Diego. 

The timeline in the resolu-
tion begins on Jan. 22 as the 
first day that UCSD under-
graduates can submit new con-
stitutions or revisions of the 
current constitution and ends 
on Mar. 8 when the final vote 
by participants in the conven-
tion will be taken. 

The main complaint with 
the timeline was that the pro-
posed constitutions and revi-
sions were schuduled to be due 
by Feb. 8, leaving students 
only two and one half weeks to 
write their own constitution or 
revise the present one. Many 
A.S. members thought the time 
period was not sufficient. 

Governor's Budget Proposal 
Spells Reduction in UC Funds 

"I'm in the A.S. and I 
couldn't write a constitution 
that is worth anything by Feb. 
8," said Third College Junior 
Senator Larry Becker. 

Ramirez defended the time-
line, saying that it was the most 
effective timeline the Rules 
Committee could create. 

"After two and one half 
weeks, the people would start 
dragging on; only the special 
interest groups would hang 
on." 

Another problem with the 
document was the lack of a 
provision disallowing the 
chairman of the convention 
from writing or co-authoring a 
constitution or revision to the 
present constitution. All 
members of the A S. agreed 
that the chairman should be 
neutral during the convention, 
but there was disagreement 
over how that could be 
achieved. 

Governor Deukmejian's pro-
posed 1990-91 state operating 
budget for the University of 
California that was announced 
last week falls well short of 
meeting the University's base 
budget requirements, its chief ad-
ministrator said. 

UC President David P. Gard-
ner expressed his hope that im-
provements in the state's finan-
cial picture this coming spring 
would provide the University 
"some relief from a budget that 
as proposed is clearly inadequate 
for the mission assigned to it by 
the state." ' 

The governor's $2.26 billion 
general fund allocation for the 
University is short of the UC 
Regents' request by over $88 
million. It provides no funding 
for most fixed costs, such as in-
creases in social security and the 
impact of inflation on the cost of 
.supplies, equipment, and library 
books. No funds have been pro-
vided to meet the cost of UC's 
planned graduate student enroll-
ment growth, and no money is 
included for program improve-
ments of any kind. 

state's financial situation im-
proves and if SCA 1 passes - as 
we hope they will. The governor 
and the Legislature will recon-
sider our needs at that time," 
Gardner said. 

The governor's proposal for 
the University represents a 5.5 
percent increase over 1989-90. 
The UC Regents have requested 
about a 10 percent overall in-
crease. Deukmejian' s budget 
provides a 4.8 percent average 
salary increase for faculty , based 
on faculty salaries at comparable 
institutions, and 3.9 percent for 
staff, consistent with the pro-
posal for other state employees. 

Both would take effect Jan. I, 
1991. 

Funding is provided by the 
governor for 1,888 new under-
graduate students, "which will 
allow us to continue our historic 
committment to enroll all Califor-
nia undergraduate students who 
qualify," Gardner said. Students 
will pay an average 4.7 percent 
more in fees under the governor's 
plan, in keeping with the regents' 
action last November. 

In expressing concern about the 
lack of funding for an additional 
900 graduate and 100 health sci-
ences students UC had planned to

Nature Walk 
At Scripps 
Vandalized 
By MELINDA HAMILTON 
Contributing Writer 

A new self-guided nature trail at Scripps 
Coastal Reserve, referred to by many stu-
dents as "the cliffs," has been vandalized 12 
times since its recent completion, accord-
ing to a UC representative. 

The quarter-mile Biodiversity Nature 
Trail paraJIelling the ocean along the cliffs 
is a part of the UC Natural Reserve System. 

According to David Zippin, a field as-
sistant for the UC Natural Reserve system, 
who designed and constructed the trail , the 
nature walk is an attempt to educate visitors 
and preserve coastal lands. 

A wooden box at the entrance of the trail 
contains brochures for visitors to use as 
they guide themselves to each of 30 posts 
and learn about the various plants and ani-
mals that live in the reserve, which includt!s 
Black' s Canyon, Sumner Canyon, and an 
80-acre area in the water. 

The Biodiversity Trail is one ofthe "last 
undeveloped coastal canyon and mesa tops 
in Califonia. Except for Camp Pendelton, 
this is really it," Zippin said. 

In addition to signs being pulled out of 
the ground by vandals, posts have been 
switched and one po t has disappeared com-
pletely. 

" It ' s a real problem," Zippen said, refer-
ring to students who use the reserve for 
parties. 

"It's so close to the [UCSD) campus. 
They leave garbage and don ' t appreciate 
the land . . . which is very sensitive to 
disturbance," Zippen said. 

According to Zippen, the area is "heav-
ily used." People who ride bikes through 
the reserve also damage the area, especially 
the endangered species of coastal barrel 
cacti, Zippen said. 

See NATURE, page 3 

Ramirez, who will be the 
chairman, argued that he 
should have the right to give 
advice to students about con-
stitutions, provided the advice 
is not given during convention 

Gardner added, however, that 
he considers this budget proposal 
to be an interim one, pending a 
June reassessment of the state's 
revenue outlook and the fate of 
SCA I, the June ballot proposi-
tion that would adjust the Gann 
state spending limit.

Health Insurance Referendum 
Passed By UCLA Grad Students 

All UCLA graduate and professional students must 
now buy the health insurance plan offered by the UCLA 
Student Health Service or provide proof of comparable 
coverage. 

More than two-third of the students who voted be-
tween Nov. 20 and Dec. 8 for the mandatory medical 
insurance referendum voted affirmatively. 

About 40 percent of the graduate and professional 
tudent body eligible to vote cast ballots, resulting in "the 

highest voting percentage of any graduate/professional 
student referendum in UCLA' history." said Chancellor 
Charles Young in a Dec. 20 leller to Universi ty officials. 

Teaching and research a sistants working more than 
25 percent of the time will have their insurance costs paiti 
for because UC officials promised to do so at campuses 
where students voted before Jan . I to implement manda-
tory health in urance before. 

UCLA now joins UC Berkeley, Davis, San Diego, 
San Francisco, and Santa Cruz as campuses having a 
mandatory medical insurance program for all graduate 
and professional students.

UCD Health Center Recalls 
Possibly Faulty Contraceptives 

A packaging error in an undetermined number of oral 
contraceptive packets has led the manufacturer to issue 
a nationwide recall of thousands of birth control pills. 

]n the defective pill packets, placebo tablets with no 
active ingredient to prevent pregnancy had been placed 
in the top row of the four-row, 28-day dispenser, accord-
ing to Pat Lindsay, director of the UC Davis health 
education program. 

If a woman begins her monthly cycle by taking the 
seven placebo pills, instead oftaking the 21 pills contain-
ing specific dosages ofhormes to prevent pregnancy, an 
unwanted pregnancy could occur, she said.

300 pill packets, were received by UCD's Cowen Stu-
dent Health Center early last quarter, according to Joe 
Manelis, director of the health center phannacy. 

Before the health center was contacted about the 
recall effort, 56 packets of Loestrin FE 1.5/30 pills were 
distributed to UCD patients, Lindsay said. 

When the manufacturer sent out an urgent recall 
notice on Dec. 18, the health center contacted each of the 
patients who might have purchased defective pill pack-
ets, Manelis said. 

After contacting the patients and checking the re-
maining packets, Manelis said he has determined that the 
health center pharmacy received no defective pill pack-
ets.

Warren Lots Closed 
Due To Bomb Scare 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Two Warren College parking 
lots and part of Voigt Drive were 
closed briefly by police Tuesday 
aftemoon, after a student suspected 
a bomb was under his vehicle. 

According to police dispatcher 

BUDGET 

Mike U' Ren, police recei ved a call 
around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday from a 
student who heard ticking and 
suspected there was a bomb under 
his white Toyota pickup in parking 
lot 502, near the Warren Apart-
ments. 

Four police officers responded, 
along with the San Diego Fire 

The UCSD Guardian 

Department and a Fire Department 
bomb squad, U 'Ren said. 

"All the people that were there 
were evacuated, and no one was 
allowed into the lot," the dispatcher 
added. 

As a result of the bomb scare, 
lot 501 , which is between the 
Warren Apartments and Central 
Library, and a ponion of Voigt 
Drive were also blocked off. 

However, U'Ren said, "there 
was nothing under the car. There 
was ticking, but it was something 
to do with his battery . ... There 
was nothing at all under there. " 

According to U'Ren, the area 
was open again by about 5:00 p.m.

The capita] proposal includes 
construction money for a sci-
ence building at San Diego, an 
engineering building at Davis, a 
science library at Irvine, Col-
leges 9 and 10 at Santa Cruz, and 
the Anderson School of Man-
agement at Los Angeles. 

~--------------------------~ 900 graduate and 100 health sci-
ences students UC had planned 
to enroll in 1990-91, Gardner 
noted, "The state has a demon-
strable need for more scientists, 
engineers, mathematicians, and 
other highly trained people if 
Califomia is to remain economi-
cally competitive. Moreover, the 
need for new faculty members 
for universities throughout the 
state and nation,due to projected 
enrollment growth and an un-
precedented number of retire-
ments in the 1990s, is 
enormous." 

Gardner expressed apprecia-
tion for the govemor's capital 
budget provision - $226.6 mil-
lion from a combination of gen-
eral obligation and revenue 
bonds - and his support for a 
$900 million higher education 
bond issue that could be placed 
before the voters this year. 

Other projects for which plan-
ning and working drawings are 
provided include visual arts and 
engineering at San Diego, engi-
neering at Irvine and Riverside, 
music at Santa Cruz, social sci-
ences and humanities at Davis, 
and seismic work on the Doe and 
Moffitt Libraries at Berkeley and 
Powell Library at Los Angeles. 

"We are pleased that the 
budget addresses our backlog of 
capital needs that developed over 
the past 15 years," Gardner said. 
"It provides facilities for student 
enrollment growth as well as 
funding for renovation and mod-
ernization of existing facilities, 
and seismic and other life safety 
projects. "

"If one bike goes off the trail, 
even accidentally, and hits one of 
the coastal barrel cacti, it could kill 
it," he explained. 

The trail does not yet have a 
pennanent sign at the entrance des-
ignating it as a nature trail. Zippin 
said he hopes the vandals will leave 
the trail alone when they realize 
that the markers along the trail 
mark path boundaries and are not 
posts for housing surveys. 

Currently, the reserve is used 
by graduate students doing research 
in the UC Natural Reserve System. 

The current project is a plan to 
reestablish the native grasses and 
edge out the European varieties 
that have taken over the land. A 
sma11 research plot at the top of the 
knoll has been fenced off for this 
purpose.

Cable Blackouts 

A Bad Regulation 
The drive toward deregulation of business that began under 

President Carter and continued (and exploded) in the Reagan Ad-
ministration had one prime impetus: that many people believed 
regulation and bureaucracy were huning them. Many regulations 
served big business rather than the consumer - why, for ex-
ample, does AT&T have to have government approval to lower 
its rates? 

But now the tide is shifting, and the perception is that deregu-
lation went too far, and some needed regulations were abolished. 
Into this gap, various business groups have worked to secure 
regulations that benefit them. 

This is nothing new. The regulation of railroads in the early 
part of this century actually benefitted the railroad monopolies, 
which were beginning to break down due to companies "cheat-
ing" on price agreements. Clear evidence of thi s is that regulators 
set minimum, not maximum, rates. 

The latest example of this is, on the surface, trivial. The 
Federal Communications Commission requires cable companies 
to blackout certain movies .and syndicated programs. Blackout 
take place if a station from Los Angeles, or, possibly, a supersta-

·tion such as Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), is showing a 
program to which a local broadcast station has rights. 

The syndication exclusivity regulation wa abolished several 
years ago, but was reimposed as of January l. 

There are several problems with this regulation. It is ail 
inconvenience to see a program listed in IV Guide, only to have 
it blacked out, with the reason being that this show is on a local 
station at 6 a.m. Sunday mornings. 

A more serious problem is that this regulation discourages 
stations from trying innovative programming or running new 
shows. A station that has a monopoly on "Hunter" may decide 
against purchasing a new syndicated show, and would almost 
certainly not produce a show of its own for that slot. 

Competition forces station s to offer better choices. This regu-
lation discourages choice, and only benefits the broadcast sta-
tions. It should never have been reimposed, and should be 
abolished . 

Dangerous Debt 

Corporate Leverage 
The bankruptcy of Campeau Corporation's huge department 

store chains comes as a chi Iling warning to the heavily leveraged 
corporate world. It was Campeau's $7.5 billion in takeover debts 
that was its undoing. 

Leveraged buyouts were all the rage in financial markets in the 
I 980s, but there 's a real fear that the chickens will come home to 
roost in the I 990s. The problem is that in a prosperous economy, 
fInns don 't have too much trouble servicing debt; they are 
earn ing high returns, have vigorous cash flow, and are growing. 

But when tough times come, this all breaks down. The 
retailing and apparel industries are having problems, and this hit 
Campeau's Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores hard. 
What happens when the whole economy fall s into the inevitable 
recession? Courts will be c hoked with corporations seeking 
Chapter 11 protection from creditors. 

How did this happen? Some will say it was a function of the 
unmitigated g reed of corporate ra iders. But that 's only half (or 
less than half} of the story. For some reason, firms didn't mind 
being heavily leveraged - that is, in debt. 

That reason is the tax code. Deductions for interest payments 
made being in debt actually desirable, or at least not repugnant, 
to many firms. A company doing a takeover would take on 
tremendous debt to afford to buy another firm. Some corpora-
tions also went heavily into debt to fight off takeovers. 

There may not be a solution to this problem. There certainly 
isn't a simple one. TIle only real option may be to modify the tax 
code to stop encouraging these sort of activities, and then work 
to keep the economy from slipping into a rece sion. Th is may 
take luck, and we're left with crossing our fingers and hoping the 
whole house of cards doesn't fall down around us.

] agree-parking at UCSD is a 
nightmare! [Guardian, Jan. 8]But 
we as students must recall that 
parking here is a privilege and not 
a right. 

Parking is not state funded and 
therefore is not provided for like 
other facilities on campus. 

As a member of the Campus 
Planning Committee, I have come 
to appreciate the scarcity of space 
on this campus. While there are 
plans to build a parking structure 
and the number of parking spaces 
are going to increase, the popula-
tion on campus is going to in-
crease along with it; therefore,it's 
time everyone realized the situ-
ation is not going to improve. 

So you really have two choices: 
you can either sit back and com-
plain about the situation or you 
can do something to alJc:viatc the 
problem. Specifically, we must 
consider alternative fonTIS of trans-
portation. 

Oh yes, I realize that we, as 
Americans, have become accus-
tomed to conveniences, but let's 
face facts-we must consider 
environmental consequences as 
well as traffic and parking situ-
ation . Therefore, I would like to 
present several options which I 
personally ftnd very attraCtive: 

San Diego Transit System: 
There are several bus routes within 
the UCSD area wbich are covered 
by the Campus Bus Permit. These 
are free, unlimited usage passes 
and can be obtained at the Parking 
and Transportation Office and the 
SIO Administrative Office. These 
are funded by revenues from park-
ing pennits and citations. Buses 
leave every half hour and can be 
caught at the Gilman-Meyers Dr. 
intersection, which is probably 
closer LO classes than many park-
ing spaces. 

Bicycles: Those of you who 
don't livetoo far from campus and 
aren 'tembarrassed bya littIesweat 
buildup should try riding your bike. 
I would almost guarantee this to 
be faster than driving, since you 
don't have to deal with traffic or 

CAVNA 

finding a parking space. Fortu-
nately, weather almost always 
pennits bicycling. While the sys-
tem is still in need of improve-
ment, UCSD has a fairly good 
bicycle system. 

Shuttle System: If you live near 
UCSD Medical Center, you can 
catch the shuttle to the BioMed 
Library. The shuttle runs every 
half hour and is about a half hour 
ride. This would allow you about 
an hour a day for studying or go- tJ -
Ling a bite to eat. 

Vanpools: I especially recom-
mend these for students who live 
outside the UCSD bus system. 
Huwever, there is one stipulation 
- that you be employed by the 
University. You are qualified re-
gardless of how few hours you 
work. The only possible draw-
back is that you must arrive and 

While these options may seem 
inconvenient, they will save you 
money and anxiety. I walk to and 
from the bus each day with my 
three-year-old son and am very 
pleased with the system. 

I've never paid for a UCSD 
parking permit and do not experi-
ence the stress associated with 
competing for parlcing. I realize 
that these options are not viable 
for some for various reasons and 
am sensitive to those situations. 

But for those of us who could 
and should use alternative fontls 
of transportation, I urge you to 
consider these great possibilities 
availabletoyouasmembersofthe 
UCSD community. I am commit-
ted to alternative transportation 
and hope that others are too.

Student Employees' Plight 
Editor: 

Last year, my wife became ill and had to be taken to the UCSD 
Medical Center for treatment. Our income level put us in a position of 
being too well off to qualify for MediCal and too poor to afford the 
Voluntary Insurance Plan offered to UCSD students. The hospital 
would not accept anything but immediate full payment of the bill , and 
since we could not comply, the account was turned over to a collection 
agency which has harassed and threatened us repeatedly. Our credit 
rating is destroyed. 

While the injustice of medical debts is a common occurrence in our 
society, my case is special. I'm an employee of UCSD. 1 teach a 50 
percent class load in the department of literature. Most university 
workers employed at 50 percent are eligible for free comprehensive 
health coverage for themsel ves and their dependents, but since I am also 
a student I do not qualify. So I'm in debt to the company hospital, my 
company's hospital. 

This is one of the many reasons that moti vated me to participate in the 
recent founding of the Association of Student Employees here on 
campus. My fellow workers and I are tired of being treated like peons, 
so we've decided to unite and work together to change things. And we 
are not alone. Student Worker unionization movements are springing up 
at campuses allover the country. If we have our way, the next generation 
of students will not have to carry a peon's burden on their backs. And we 
will have our way!

of the media. 

Perhaps most s ignificant, beyond as-
suming that a crime victim would try to 
give police an accurate description of his 
victim, there is good reason why Stuart's lie 
was believed; indeed, the initial reactions 
among black leaders was not to discount 
Stuart's story, but to demand equal com-
passion for the black victims of black per-
petrators: a completely justifiableresponse. 

NEW YORK- When Charles Stuart's 
body was fished out of Boston's Mystic 
River last week, it triggered this year's 
Great Media Debate: Did the press contrib-
ute to racial tension by too readily believing 
Stuart's dramatic tale of robbery and mur-
der at the hands of a black gunman? 

Last October,the country was riveted by 
audio tapes of Charles Stuart's call from his 
car phone to police, by TV tapes of him and 
his wife sitting bloodied in the front seat of 
their car, by the horror of whaL apparently 
happened to this "Camelot" couple. 

Carol Stuart died of her wounds, as did 
their unborn son; Charles almost died from 
a stomach wound and was in intensive care 
for five weeks. The political establishment 
and the press of Boston went into over-
drive. 

Front page editorials called for a "get 
tough" approach to crime; politicians 
demanded a return to the death penalty; 
police swept through the black segments of 
the Mission Hill neighborhood where the 
crime occurred, detaining black men who 
seemed to fit Charles Stuart 's description 
of his attacker.

accounted for the crime, much of Boston's 
black leadership has demanded accounta-
bility from the politicians and the press. 

Why, they ask, did the press so readily 
believe a black man had committed the 
crime? Why were so 

First, the reason why the police and 
press believed Charles SlUan' s story is that 
it seemed impossible to disbelieve: A man 
who fakes an attack on himself is not likely 
to shoot himself in the stomach and nearly 
kill himself.

nity, including random killings of a young 
girl and a teen-age boy, did not draw nearly 
as much attention and police resources? 
Why were the media so ready to describe 
black neighborhoods as dangerous, crime-
ridden places? 

And why did the press so eagerly point 
to a young black man named Willie Bennett 
as a "prime suspect" in the case? 

In this case, I believe, the answers to 
these questions tell us more about human 

have been immedi-
ate, especially since most murders happen 
between people who know each other. But 
to believe that a man would risk death is 
asking police and press for an excessive 
measure of skepticism. 

Second, Willie Bennett, a man with a 
25-year criminal record and an IQ of 65, 
had boasted to at least one relati ve that he 
had in fact shot the Stuarts. At the very 
least, that gave poli ce reason to think hehad 
done the crime. 

"Last October, the country was riveted by audio tapes of Char-
les Stuart's call from his car phone to pollee, by TV tapes of him 
and his wife sitting bloodied In the front seat of their car, by the 
horror of what apparently happened to this 'Camelot' couple. " 

In Boston in 1988. 100 homicides were 
committed; 63 of the victims were black. In 
that same city, where 23 percent of the 
population is black, blacks account for 65 
percent of violent crime arrests . As in almost 
every big city in America, blacks nre pre-
dominantly perpetrators and victims. 

Indeed, this is where the real media 
failure lies: not in prominently reporting 
the plausible story of Charles Stuart, but in 
neglecting the daily horror of crime in the 
poorer neighborhoods of our ci ties: in rec-
ognizing the human horror of violent crime 
only when it happens to "us." 

Day after day, night afternight, the wave 
of violence oppresses the men and women 
and children of our neighborhoods; it is the 
single biggest threat to their lives and fu-
tures. The problem is not that the media 
"stigmatizes"these neighborhoods, but that 
it does not treat this condition as an urgent 
violation of the most elemental of human 
rights.

Scripps' Beach Walks 
Raise Funds For Acquarium 
By Doreen Erenea ,Associatt Features Editor 
Plwtographs by J e,."ifer Kolsky, St4ff Plwtograplur 

A closer look at marine life and the sea can be had through a variety of 
events sponsored by Scripps Aquarium. 

"The Institute [Scripps] arranges activities throughout the year to accomo-
date people who have an interest in marine life, II said Cindy Clark, an aquarium 
representative. 

Scripps sponsors events ranging from whale watching excursions to 
aquarium tours . 

Recendy, a beach walk was held to give the public a closer look at the 
tidepools and marine life off the coast of Cardiff. Such walks are guided by 
aquarium naturalists. 

The naturalists explain the history of the coastline and point out the specific 
names and historical background of the sea life. 

The aquarium representatives note that winter is one of the best times to go 
on the beach walks because there are more low tides during this period, making 
marine life in the tidepools easier to see. 

Beach walks cost $10 for adults and $6 for children ages 7- 13. 
"The money goes to pay the naturalists for the tours, and the extra money 

goes . . . back to fund more activities," said aquarium staff member Craig 
Klampe. 

Aquarium memberships are available to the public, and members are given a 
calendar of events for the year. More information about future tours is available 
by calling 534-3474. 

Warren Literary Journal Provides Students Chance to Get Published 
By MARK BUBIEN 
Staff Writer 

So you want to be an artist, or a writer, or 
a poet, but you don ' t know how to get 
published, or don't think there 's enough 
money in it. The Warren College Literary 
JourfUll may be what you ' re looking for -
it offers a chance to be published, and even 
the possibili ty of winning $50 or $100. 

Submissions of short stories, poetry, 
photography, and art from Warren College 
students are currently being solicited, ac-
cording to Robert McDonell, program rep-
re entative for the Warrell College LiTerary 
JourruIl. 

McDonell said Mories and poetry may be 
of any length, but noted that tudents should 
conSider that longer submissions will meet 
tougher scrutiny than other articles, because 

longer pieces have the potential to displace 
shorter ones. 

The review process for inclusion of work 
in the journal is a two-step process,McDonell 
said. First, an editorial board, consisting of 
undergraduates, graduate students, and staff 
members, will choose approximately 40 to 
45 writing submissions out of an expected 
350, and about 15 pieces of art from an 
expected 30. The chosen submissions will 
be published in the journal. 

The second step is the judgi ng process. 
Faculty members will select the best twO 
entries in each category: art, pro~e, and 
poetry. 

First and second prize winners will reo 
ceive $ 100 and $50, respectively. Awardl> 
will be presented by Warren College Pro 
vost David Wong at a reception during 

Spring Quarter. 
Written submissions should be typed and 

double spaced, while art and photography 
should be able to be reduced to a black and 
white 5-1/2 inch by 8-1/2 inch format. 

Works must inel ude an original and three 
copies without the author' s name. 

All submissions are due at the Warren 
College Writing Office, MAAC 410, by 
Jan. 19. 

An entry form must accompany each 
submiss ion, and may be acquired at the 
Warren College Writ ing Office. The writ-
ing office also provides a handout that de-
scribes the contest. 

Students from colleges o ther than War-
ren may not submit the ir works , but 
McDonell said they may become involved 
by joining the journal 's editorial board. He 

said that interested students should have up-
per division standing or show some experi-
ence in art istic or literary critique. 

Volunteers may contact McDonell at 534-
3068. He said editorial board members will 
attend weekly meetings and assist in the ed-
iting and layout of the journal. 

According to McDonell, the journal is an 
attempt to give students both incentive and 
experience in writing and art before gradu-
ation. 

McDonell said that Warren College is 
the only of all five UCSD colleges to pro-
duce a liberal arts publication. 

McDonell credits the Warren College 
Provos t office and the Warren College 
Writing Program, which both provide fund-
ing, and " the goodwill of people like David 
Wong" wi th making the journal possible.

Tritons Split Meet With Fresno State in Natatorium 

19 Swimmers Already Heading to Nationals

UCSD Drops La Verne 72-63; 
N ear-Perfect 7-1 Homestand 

Women's Basketball Wins Sixth Straight, now 9-5 
By MA ITHEW ROCHIOS 
Conrribwing Writer 

Oh. those win streaks! 
On a wet and windy Tuesday 

night. the UCSD women's basket-
ball team fought off early slug-
gishness and blew by a tough La 
Verne team by raining baskets from 
allover the court, 72-63. 

The win marked the team's sixth 
in a row and its eighth victory in 
the last nine games. The win also 
completes a 7-1 three-week home-
stand. 

"Ugly," was the first word Head 
Coach Judy Malone could use to 
describe the game. "We came out 
real tight because we didn't know 
what to expect." 

Malone pointed to the fact that 
La Verne (9-6) had recently blown 
out Claremont by 20 points, a team 
which defeated UCSD by one point 
on Dec. I, and that the Tritons 
were cautious. 

Fortunately, La Verne was suf-
fering from several of the same 
problems as UCSD early in the 
game: sloppy play and lack of exe-
cution. The Tritons' glue-like man-
to·man defense frustrated the 
Leopards, forcing them to shoot 
only 24 percent in the first haIf-
a primary reason UCSD possessed 
a 39-26 halftime lead. 

The turning point in the game 
came with five minutes remaining 
in the first half. 

Malone made a wise coaching 
move by implementing UCSD's 
recently learned, yet highly suc-
cessful, 1-2-1-1 full-court press. 
The pressure seemed to take the 
lethargic Leopards by surprise, as 
they were forced into committing 
16 turnovers in the first half al~me. 
Quick-handed Nancy Caparaz 
pickpocketed the Leopards for six 
steals. 

"I wish we had executed as well 
as they did in the first half," La 
Verne Head Coach Rich Hernan-
dez said, referring to the Tritons. 
' 'They out-hustled us, and they have 
a deeper bench than we do," he 
said. 

Verne]." 
Malone also expressed some 

doubts about the game, saying that 
the team was "worried" about the 
La Verne squad. But, as the second 
half dictated, there was really noth-
ing to worry about. UCSD main-
tained its pressing ways and cruised 
to a nine point victory. 

With five minutes left in the 
contest, La Verne momentarily cut 
the Triton lead to five at 66-61. 
Reserve guard Michelle DiGuilio 
drove the lane between four de-
fenders for a layup and was fouled. 
She completed the three-point play, 
effectively killing the La Verne 
threat. 

Guard Kathleen Alvarez nailed 
three three-pointers , sank several 
long-range deuces, and hit a per-
fect 5-5 atthe charity stripe for a 20 
point evening. Leading rebounder 
Carl Young pulled down 17 boards 
and put back a few for 15 points. 

The Tritons will now embark 
on a three-week, five-game road 
sequence that includes major chal-
lenges at Cal State San Bernardino 
and Azusa Pacific. These road 
games will undoubtedly pose a 
difficulttest forthe Tritons (2-3 on 
the road this season) and their six 
game winning streak. 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Senior Slaff Wriler 

When it comes to swimming, 
the Triton is not king. 

Kenyon CollegeofOhio, which 
has won five consecutive women's 
and ten straight men's titles, sits 
proudly on the throne, year after 
year. 

But this year, UCSD - which 
has already qualified 19 swimmers 
to the NCAA Division III National 
Championships - is on a mission 
to knock Kenyon from its pedestal. 
Tuesday evening, the Tritons con-
tinued to prepare for an eventual 
championship meeting with 
Kenyon by splitting a meet with 
Division I Fresno State in the 
Natatorium. Although the women 
fell 120-85, the men defeated a 
depleted Bulldog squad, 101-91. 

The women's meet provided a 
bit of revenge for the Fresno State 
squad, for it was defeated by the 
Tritons earlier this month at the 
San Diego Senior Invitational. 

"It was a good meet," UCSD 
coach Bill Morgan said. "Fresno 
has been priming themselves for 
this meet since we beat them, and 

The Tritons are praying to those 
above that they will put Kenyon 
College in its place - second 
place - for a change. Kenyon 
College has won the Division III 
national title (men andwomen) 
for the past five years in a row. 

they had a great meet. We have 
been in the middle of a hard train-
ing period and weren ' t rested." 

Still , UCSD's top-ranked 
women received strong perform-
ances from Catherine Capriles and 
Sabrina Lum. Capriles won the 
200-yard backstroke with a timeof 
2: 10.71, and the 200-yard individ-
ual medley at 2: 10.18. Lum, a first-
year student, swam a personal best 
en route to a 2:09.07 win in the 200 
bunterfly. Cindy Miller also quali-
fied for nationals in the 200 breast. 

With only a handful of Bulldog 
swimmers in town for the men's 
dual meet, third-ranked UCSD was 
able to put forth a lineup which did 
not feature its best swimmers. Brad 
1llomas led the Tritons with victo-
ries in the 100- and 200-yard frees-
tyle. His times in the two events 
place him among the top five 
Division ill swimmers in the coun-
try. 

"Everything is focused towards 
the National Championships," 
Morgan said. "We are entering the 
real character building part of our 
schedule now. Wewantto see who 
can handle the level of competi-
tion that we will face at the Na-
tional meets." 

Upcoming matches agaiost such 
Pacific Ten powers as USC, Ari-
zona, and Arizona State will help 
to determine whether UCSD will 
be able to break Kenyon's strong-
hold on the Division ill crown. 
These teams will give Triton swim-
mers the opportunity to face teams 
of national championship caliber 
and the chance to continue to qual-
ify for the National Champion-
ships in March. 

The women have already quali-
fied 11 swimmers and divers in 26 
events. They have been led by 
UCLA transfer Capriles (six 
events), Lum (five events) and 
Jenna Banaszek (four events). 

The men have placed eight 
swimmers in nationals in 15 dif-
ferent events. Jason Vance, fresh 
off a successful water polo season, 
and Dave Sacco lead the qualify-
ing parade with three events each. 

"We have a lot of stars," Mor-
gan said, "but we need another six 
to eight swimmers to emerge as 
people who can score at nationals. 
If we do that, we have the ability to 
beat Kenyon."

Money - Kathleen Alvarez, 
shown here toeing the three-
point line, has been a potent 
three· point threat for the Tri-
tons this year. On Tuesday, she 
canned three from that range. 

Yet, Malone and some of the 
UCSD players fell dltferently about 
the game. Forward Bernadette 
Diepenbrock, who tossed in 10 
points and grabbed seven rebounds, 
acknowledged the team's tentati ve-

Basketball Supershot Competition 
Saturday/January 27/10 am/Main Gym 

Any Chris Jackson 's or Bo Kimble's out there? Oh, 
c'mon. You know who you are _ You've been blistering our 
nets at UCSD year in and year out. Noonball, IMs, pick-up 
games, every time you throw it up, it always seems to have 
a chance. And usually, you make it happen. Swish, swish, 
swish. Music to any hoopsters ears. Especially yours. 

Well , we 're trying find the best shooter at UCSD and 
we're not talking pool, and we're not talking heroin, and 
we're not talking craps. We 're tal king basketball, baby, and 
It's t ime for you to come in from the cold and start lighting 
this place up. 

The event is the annual UCSD Basketball Supershot 
Competition . The place is the Main Gym. The day is 
Saturday, January 27th. The time ... 10 am. 

You will have at least two one-minute time trials to shoot 
as many baskets as possible from a variety of point pOSi-
tions. Quick lay-ups from the 1-foot area score one point 
and 20-foot rainbows can score 7 points, with plenty of 
intermediate point scoring opportunities for shots in be-
tween. 

The objective is consistent. Make as many as you can, 
and see how it totals up. High point finishers will be invited 
back to a championship shoot-off during half-time of the 
UCSD-Domincan basketball game on Monday, Feb, 5. 

Last year's champion Rick Lau will be back to defend his 
crown , but th is competition closely resembles the Super 
Bowl. It's dam tough to repeat. 

Sign-ups for this year's event will be taken at where 
else ... the Canyonview Recreation Offices beginning today 
with competition open to al l UCSD students, faculty, and 
staff. Sign·up deadline is Friday, Jan 26th at 4pm. 

We'll give two guarantees with this event. Guarantee No. 
1.. .. Chris and Bo will not show up. Guarantee NO. 2 .. . at the 
end of this event, you will know how good of shooteryou are. 
And that's a guarantee.

All-Campus 
Tennis Doubles Championships 
Sat. -Sun. January 27-28 
Muir Courts 

Often referred to infonnally as "the Fifth Grand Slam event" on 
the world-wide tennis circuit, the 12th annual All-Campus Tennis 
Doubles Champion-ships makes its return to UCSD on Saturday-
Sunday, January 27-28. 

The double your pleasure weekend event will feature four 
divisions of play to Include: Men's Open, Men's Intermediate, 
Women's Open, and Mixed Open. Entrants will be limited to play 
in one division only due to scheduling limitations. 

Each doubles team will be guaranteed two consecutive 
matches on Saturday morning or afternoon (please indicate your 
preference when signing-up) with successful teams advancing to 
the championship brackets on Sunday. 

The unique double-participation tournament format will help 
settle any of those "Ah ... you got lucky that game" 
attitudes that player's sometimes adopt after a 
tough loss. C'mon, folks, you know who you arel 

The entry fee for the tournament you can't 
beat. One can of NEW Wilson, Penn, or Dunlop 
tennis balls will do the trick. And that's not the 
three drool balls that Sparky has been playing 
with and you happened to have found under the 
sofa Saturday morning. 

Team registration and sign-ups are currently 
under way at the Canyonview Recreation 

Offices. Entry deadline is Friday, Jan. 26 at 12 noon. All teams 
should call Tournament Director, Mike Hipp at Canyonview after

You may have seen ~ late at night on cable television. You may have played it on the sa . But now, ladies, 
here is your chance to be recognized as the best at it. 

The sometimes annual UCSD Women's Volleyball Doubles Tournament Is back at UCSD. In fact, it's happening

Party 
Games 

Cups-Boot Factor: 3 
Cups is perfect for hars and £rugal beer garners who don't want 

to invest in equipment. All you need are beer and plastic cups. 
The object of Cups is to flip you cup in the au-at least one full 

revolution so that it lands standing up on either end. If a player 
flips the cup and it lands right-side up, me next player in rotation 
must fInish a whole cup ofbeer. If the cup lands upside-down, the 
next player must drink JUSt half a beer. If the cup lands on its side. 
the "flipper" must take a healthy sip of his beer. And if the cup 
rolls off the table, the flipper must drink a whole beer. After each 
flip, regardless of the outcome, the cup is passed. 

When a cup lands on one of its ends, the player who must 
drink can decide to reverse the direction of the game simply by 
saying so before ne flips his cup. The game travels in the new 
direction until another player reverses. 

Cups was unheard of in ancienttime$ (i.e., before the inven-
tion of fast food). when man dranJc only from. bottles and cans. 
The advent of the keg party spawned the cup subculture that has 
been growing steadily since the 19505.

Animal Acts Appear 
at the Lyceum 

By Christina Huizar 
Senior Staff Writer 

"The greatness of a nation and its 
moral progress can be judged Iry the 
way its animals are treated." 

- Mohandas Gandhi 

Playwright Steve Friedman 
believes that the time has come 
when animals are perceived as pets. 
pests, resources, tools, commodi-
ties, and most unfortunately, ex-
perimental models. 

Friedman has taken this prem-
ise and fed it to us intravenously in 
the form of an open space (a stage) 
filled with moving metaphors 
(actors) and postulated opinion 
(dialogue). 

Friedman, creator of "Animal 
Nation," will present his produc-
tion at the lyceum Theatre in 
downtown San Diego through 
January 21. 

"Animal Nation," as the title 
might suggest, offers a satirical look 
at the post-evolutionary world of 
George Orwell, author of Animal 
Farm and 1984. 

The setting of "Animal Na-
tion" is the Bio-Test Farm, where 
barnyard animals are raised for sci-

entific breeding. Scientific experi-
ments are then practiced on these 
mass-produced animals. 

Gene manipulation, by way of 
a seven-way gene splice, turns 
barnyard passivity into an organ-
ized revolution, overturning Mr. 
George. the human supervisor, 
responsible for the lab and ani-
mals. 

Webelo, the mysterious DNA 
splicing experiment, is a genetic 
cross between a wolf, bear, lion, 
human, and two other animals. It 
is Webelo, with his prophetic vi-
sions, who leads the animals to 
build a brave new world of their 
own. 

The next stage of the play takes 
a closer look at the individual 
animals. Each character comes 
forward to recant, testify, and 
publicly apologize for its actions 
during the revolution. 

This sequence of scenes bears a 
haunting echo of the events in 
Beijing last spring. These allusions 
to the Chinese prodemocracy 
movement are not accidental. 
claims company representative 

Sam Woodhouse. 
As the play deepens, confusion 

intensifies. The major problem 
"Animal Nation" presents is not 
the stance taken, or the lightheart-
edness instilled, but rather that 
too many controversial topics are 
taken on in a relatively restricted 
time constraint. The list of big 
ideas commented on include Third 
World politics, animal rights, 
DNA gene manipulation, and the 
very idea behind the quest for free-
dom. 

The performance of the ani-
mals (actors) possesses a wonder-
ful sense of animation specific to 
each animal. The gestures, sounds, 
and movements of the actors are 
realistic, yet possess a certain sense 
of symbolism. 

As one walks away from the 
Lyceum Theatre, the concepts 
presented in the last two hours 
linger in the mind, resting on the 
tip of the tongue, waiting for any 
stimuli to prompt a discussion. 

The Lyceum Theatre is located 
in Horton Plaza. Performances of 
"Animal Nation" are Tuesday 
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
Sundays at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

CHECKOUT

BLOWOUT 

"Testing of Abraham" is an 
attack on the "hypocrisy" of reli-
gion" that Arredondo discovered 
while attending Catholic school. 
He noticed a mass of "YUPPIES-
to-be" and wanted to write a 
"cynical play about Divine Rule." 

It was evident to the audience 
that Arredondo's work was in-
tended to be humorous. The per-
formances were brilliant, hilari-
ously displaying the lack of a vis-
ible bond between husband and 
wife. The actors presented a shal-
lowness that Arredondo believes 
exists today among success-ori-
ented couples. 

The third piece, "Avatar of 
Descent," is a work by Jay Schwartz 
of Culver City. The play, in drastic 
conflict the of traditional

a variety of thoughts and

homosexuality. But what results is 
a crude, ambiguous production. 

It is evident that this work was 
selected as a representation of the 
current trend in performance thea-

The piece presents a black father 
and his adult Caucasian son as 
they struggle through the mother's 
recent departure, their past, and 
the treatment of a younger brother 
with Down's Syndrome. Their 
conflict rises to a highly emotional 
level until a family disaster changes 
their lives and their relationships 
forever. 

In Kobrick, we find the most 
promising talent of all the young 
playwrights. His story was-com-
plex, compelling and highly 
charged with emotions. 

The dialogue was superb and 
very true to life. Every exchange 
between father and son was so 
intensely executed that one must 
wonder if any improvisations oc-

curred. Yet surprisingly, the play is 
entirely fiction, further demon-
strating Kobrick's talent. 

As for the actors, they were 
exceptional. There are just not 
enough superlatives to describe 
these two outstanding performers. 
Manhew Mabe's role as the young 
Caucasian son was one of the best 
recent performances I have seen. 
His acting was so believable, so 
moving that the entire audience 
felt emotionally drained at the 
conclusion. 

Ernie McCray was also phe-
nomenal as the neurotic, yet lov-
ing father. His talent is only evi-
dent when the climax occu,s, and 
we realize the beauty of his per-
formance.

'Bugs' Tickles Audience 
By Helena Leng Loh

Two prehistoric men sit out-
side a cave picking bugs out of 
each others' hair. What are they

vors of lice, right? Wrong. Try

"It has elements of that kind of 
rapport-a situation where people 
are actually talking about some-
thing ofinterest,and it's not some-
thing that you talk about every-

the same time," Fletcher said in a 
recent interview. 

Director Mike Alberts, also a 
UCSD graduate, added that the 
film blends many philosophies and 
styles: "Existentialism , fa[3lism,

Bizarre, indeed. These cavemen 
co-exist with dinosaurs yet also 
receive The New Yorker in the mail. 
There's no question of a suspen-
sion of disbelieffor those watching 
this film . 

Nor does the film have a tradi-
tional plot structure. "It's a se-
quenceofvignettes that take place, 

and it's up to 
you to piece 
them together 
like a puzzle," 
Alberts said. 

This factor 
makes for both 
an amusing 
and confusing 
piece of work. 
Because of the 
short length of 
the film, char-
acter develop-
ment was lim-
ited in favor of 
dialogue. As 
one member of 
Friday's audi-
ence com -

mented, there 
should have 
been more 
room for the 

story and characters to "evolve." 
Yet plot and characterization 

were not the main focuses of the 
film, according to Fletcher. "It's a 
theater of the absurd," Fletcher 
explained. "These characters are 
being used to assert differentpoints 
of view or different ideas in a run-
ning argument." 

The ongoing debate is carried 
on largely by Nob (Justin Bookey), 
a prehistoric surfer archetype, and 
Fik (Randy Walton), who has just 
had the sudden fortune of walking 
upright and evolving into a homo 
sapien. This mayor may not have 
something to do wi th the fact that,

nosaurs yet

New Yorker In 
the mail. 

like us highly-developed modem 
homo sapiens, he partakes in the 
practice of perusing a magazine 
while relieving himself. 

The two protohumans con-
standy debate over whether evo-
lution exists-or, rather, will ex-
ist-and, if so, whether this prog-
ress will be beneficial to mankind. 
How do they know about evolu-
tion? Why, through Th£ New 
Yorker, of course . 

"The characters [engage] in an 
intellectual debate, much to the 
de-evolution of the group to be 
honest," Fletcher explained, "be-
cause they're so busy arguing and 
contemplating this that they're not 
taking care of business. They spend 
more time talking than doing." 

The hulking Grot (Curt 
Owens) similarly spends little time 
"dOing." Throughout most of the 
film, he is seen asleep or dazed. 
Nob warns Fik that lazy stupid 
Grot could be the "final product" 
of evolution. Yet Grot pulls off a 
coup by the end of the film, sur-
prising everyone- the audience 
included.

UCSD has a large artscommunity, 
but, as far as students talking with 
other students on an interpersonal 
level about art, that just doesn't 
happen. 

"People do that with music. 
Music is a big topic of peoples' dis-
cussions," Alberts said. "But film 
says a lo t more than music does, 
because it's visual and audio, and 
there's a lot more interaction in 
it. " 

"Bugs In Our Hair" succeeds in 
both the visual and audio depart-
ment. The musical score, com-
posed by Daniel Pritchard of the 
UCSDAudio-Visual Department, 
has a real groove to its prehistork

Red Flag Met With Enthusiam 
By Lara Heisler and Jennifer Yancey 

Editorial Assistants . 

Last Friday's TG gave San Diego's synth band 
Red Flag an opportunity to show us their electrified 
stage performance. Don't misunderstand-we don't 
mean electrified in the figurative sense, as in "full of 
life" or "packed with intensity and excitement." We 
mean electrified in the literal sense. 

The show was 100 percent electronic. Had there 
been a power outage, a hort circuit, or a faulty 
floppy disk, brorhers 
Chris and Mark Rey-
nolds would have had 
to leave the stage or 
try to find a tape of 
their music to play 
on a really loud bat-
tery operated port-
able stereo. 

Before the band 
appeared, you 
couldn't help but 
notice the emptiness 
of the stage. There 
was a keyboard with 
a computer attatched 
to it on one side and 
two standing micro-
phones on the other. 

But while the 
stage was sparsely 
covered, the audi-
ence was densely 
packed. There were 
tons of fans anxiously 
awaiting the band's 
performance and 
many a Red Flag (or 
Depeche Mode) tee-
shirt could be seen in 
the crowd. This band 
clearly has a large 
following. 

stant gyrating. Chris moved his fingers a lot, but was 
otherwise a static performer. Mark opened and closed 
his mouth, turned his head from side to side, and gave 
us a couple of choreographed hand gestures, but that 
was it. 

Although the band didn't move a lor, the crowd 
did. There was a large group of dancers, and everyone 
seemed pleased with the show, as was Mark. "I was on 

tonight," he com-
mented after the per-
formance. 

Emotionally 
charged, his vocals 
were strong enough to 
bridge the gap be-
tween the synthesized 
and the personal ele-
ments of the show. 
The concert flowed 
smoothly, with a re-
freshing lack of tech-
nical problems. 

We were fortunate 
enough to speak with 
the band both before 
and after the show. 
This 'British techno-
pop duo,' which has 
lived in the states 
since both performers 
were 8 years old, isop-
timistic about its fu-
ture in the world of 
electronic music. 

"1990 hit, and we 
got booked all over 
the place," Mark ex-
plained. "I think it's 
because you're look-
ing toward the future, 
and when you look to 
the future you look, 
sometimes, to what is 
high-tech. We are 
high-tech." 

The show starred 
with Clu is playing a 
melodic ballad on the 
keyboard. When lead 
singer Mark made his 
appearance on stage, 
the crowd wen t wild. 
The third dramatic Mark Reynolds-This is another one about love . . . 

The name Red 
Flag originates from 
the brothers' love of 
surfing. Only later did 
they become aware of entrance was made 

by a striking blonde female clad in black leather and 
dark sunglasses. Chris later informed us, "She's not 
in the band; she's just with the band." 

rour Decision. rour Choice. 
Perhaps the brothers Reynolds should change her 

status, as she was the only person on stage who pro-
vided any visual interest on stage through her con-

the fact that a red flag also has communist connota-
tions. After the show, a fan approached Mark and 
asked, "Hey, like are you guys commies or what?" 
With a sigh, Mark tried to explain, "no, we're the most 
capitalistic band around." He went on to descri be how

Flag and explained that their songs are mainly about love. "I'm not sure 
why," Mark said. When asked 
about possibly exploring dlfferent 
musical genres, Mark commented, 
"There's so much we can do here. 
I mean, you can spend your whole 
life writing love songs .. .love is 
something that everyone can re-
late to in some ways, in different 
ways."

they were playing off of the mar-
ketability of Soviet allusions. 

An Exciting Saturday Night 
When talking about the duo's 

musical style, comparisons to De-
peche Mode are inevitable. "We 
really like Depeche," Mark ex-
claimed. "We haven't met them. 
We'd love to. We think they're 
really cool." One can only wonder 
if Depeche Mode feels the same 
way about Red Flag. 

'When you look to 
the future you look 
sometimes to what is 
high-tech. We are 
high-tech." 

-Mark Reynolds 

In further discussion about their 
sound, the brothers defended new 
music technology. "Our music, a 
lot of it is very acoustical {sic)," 
Chris said. Mark complained, 
"When you're a synth band, you 
get criticized. 'Your music is too 
electronical-itdoesn't have a heart 
or a soul.'" 

Chris added, "People think if 
you are all acoustic and no pro-
grammers, your music is more 
human. But that's not true. You 
get out of computers what you put 
into them. You still have to know 
something about music." 

Mark is the lyricist of the duo, 

Redirected onto the issue of a 
change in musical style, Chris 
clarified, "We could change. I 
think what we are heading toward 
is more of an industrial sound. 
Abrasive. but original. Another 
angle that we have IS we write 
dance tunes. We don't think of 
ourselves as a dance band. We're 
a band that writes dance tunes." 
Mark added, "I'm not sure why. 
That's just what we do." 

Their history has been some-
thing of a dream. After they 
stopped attending Mesa college, 
they were discovered in a club by a 
record producer. The two were 
thrilled by their lucie:. "It's been a 
fairy tale ever since," Mark gushed. 

As for the future of this band. 
they hope to continually improve. 
Chris asserted, "We don't want 
the songwriting process to be 
something that is really calculated 
because it will sound like that." 
Mark emphasized. "We want it to 
be real free, we improvise and keep 
trying new things. We're getting 
better at that." 

If they do indeed realize this 
goal, there is no reason why the 
duo should not attain large-scale 
success. 

This Saturday night a 
sampling of some of the best 
local bands will be performing 
at the Triton Pub in a benefit 
concert for Global Walk. 
Nightsoil Man, Helicopter, 
Daddy Long Uggs, and Plum 
Daisy will all be playing live,
