U CSD Music Prof. 
Receives Pulitzer 

By REBEKAH DENN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Professor Roger Rey-
nold was awarded the 1989 Pul-
itzer in Prize for Music, Columbia 
University announced Thursday. 

His prize-winning work, Whis-
pers Out of Time, is a 25-minute 
composition fo r string orchestra. 
It was written while Reynolds was 
on a leave of absence at Amherst 
University last fall and was per-
formed once, to an audience of a 
few hundred people, last Decem-
ber. 

piece so infrequently performed. 
The prestigious Pulitzer, which 

includes a $3,000 cash award, 
"raises general recognition of your 
work," Reynolds believes. 

Though nominated for the Pul-
itzer several times, this year is the 
first time Reynolds has won it 
and marks the second time in five 
years the prize has come to the 
UCSDmusicdepartment.ln 1984, 
it was awarded to Professor Ber-
nard Rands.

that the prize was awarded to a 

Two Pulitzers in one depart-
ment, said Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, is an indication of the 
excellence of that department. The 
Pulitzer is a double honor for 
Reynolds, Atkinson said, "both 
for his own brilliant accomplish-
ments and for his role in helping 
create the department. "

dents who gathered Wednesday to hear the Cardiff Reefers. The concert was part of "Party Smart Day " 

Roger Reynolds 

Reynolds, a UCSD professor 
since 1969, is the founder of the 
campusCenter for Music Experi-
ment, and is widely known for his 
diverse musical compositions. 

"I can't think of anyone more 
deserving [oft he prize]," said John 
Laver, administrative director of 
the Center for Music Experiment. 

"Each new work he produces is 
a real gem in its own right, though 
it may be different than the last 
one." 

Recent pieces by Reynolds have 
been performed by the New York 
Philharmonic and the San Fran-
cisco Symphony, and have been 

featured at international music 
festivals in Japan and Germany. 

Reynolds often works with 
computer synthesizer . 

Whispers Out of Time, though 
performed by 23 string instru-
ments, was composed with the aid 
of a computer algorithm Reynolds 
wrote. The computer, however, 
"is only a modern tool," he said, 
and his music has an uncom-
monly wide range.

U C Will Not Support 
Renewal of Fee Policy 

By CATHERINE DILLE 
Staff Writer I 

The UC is one of the only two 
organization which has failed to 
support renewal of a fee policy 
affecting UC and CSU students. 

The current student fee policy 
prohibits fee increase above 10 

percent in any aC(ldemic year and 
ensure 10 months notice to tu-
dents of up-coming fee increa es 
o that students and families can 

plan to meet added financial bur-
dens. The policy, enacted in 1985, 
i due to expire in Augu t of 1990 
if legislation is not pa sed to ex-
tend it. 

Nine Referenda Will Appear On Spring Ballot 
According to Executive Direc-

tor of the UCSA Dale Kelly 
Bankhead, the only two members 
of the Sunset Review Committee 
on Statewide Student Fee Policy 
to oppose extending the policy 
were repre entative of the Uni-
versity and the California Student 
Aid Commis ion.

will appear on the ballot in next

and con arguments following the

Finlan Urges 
Hiring Lawyer 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Slaf! Wriler 

Student Advocate Bard-
Alan Finlan last night urged 
the A.S. Council to support 
the referendum to explore 
the possibility of hiring a 
lawyer to represent students 
in legal conflicts with the 
University. 

Finlan cited the case of a 
student who had been ac-
cused of academic miscon-
duct , saying that the stu-
dent had been intimidated

expressed by A.S. Council mem-
bers. The administration is not 
bound to act on the results of the 
student vote, but they may be 
influenced by them. 
I) Student Advocate Referendum 
Question: 

"The ASUCSD Student Ad-
vocate is presently a presidential 
appointment. Should the 
ASUCSD Student Advocate be 
an elected position? (Advisory 
Vote Only)" 

PRO: As an appointee, it stands 
to reason that the student advo-
cate must have the support and 
confidence of the president. As 
one councilmember phrased it, 
candidates in an election for the 
position "wouldn't have to kiss 
ass to the president. "The process 
would also give students an active 
role in the selection of their ad-
vocate. 

CON: While the president un-
derstands the qualifications neces-
sary for the position, students 
may be ignorant or apathetic 
about the position. Therefore, 
electing the student advocate may 
not be an effective way of choos-
ing a worthy candidate. 
2) TG Referendum Question: 

"Should the ASUCSD provide 
funds for free beer at TGs?" 

PRO: The tradition of free beer 
at TGs gives UCSD's social life a 
much needed boost. The beer 
increases attendance at the TGs, 
making the event enjoyable, even 
for those who cannot drink. 

CON: Since only those over 21 
may benefit from the free beer, 
the money may be better spent on 
an activity open to all students. 
3) Chancellor's Vote of Confi-
dence Referendum Question: 
"Do you feel that Chancellor 
Atkinson has adequately admin-
istered the UCSD campus with 
the best interests of UCSD under-
graduate students in mind?" 
4) Constitutional Amendment 
Referendum Question: 

"Amend the A.S. Constitution 
to read, 'There shall not be more 
than three referenda per academic 
year for the purpose ()f presenting 
for consideration to the students 
of the ASUCSD a constitutional 
or campus fee amendment.' .. 

The current limit on such refer-
enda is one per academic quarter. 
Councilmembers are ubmitting 
this referendum to give the A.S. 
more freedom in creating an effi-

cient constitution. 
S) Amphitheater/Events Center 
Fee Referendum Question: 

"Do you wish to assess a new 
student fee of $20 per undergrad-
uate student per quarter begin-
ning in the fall of 1990 for the 
construction of an Amphithea-
ter / E vents Center?" 

PRO: This center would pro-
vide students with an outdoor 
programming facility and a signif-
icant new source of revenue. The 
administration is not currently 
planning to build an amphithea-
ter, so if the students want this 
facility they can pass this referen-
dum and create their own plan. 

CON: Because there is no cur-
rent plan or selected site for the 
amphitheater, and no administra-
tive support, students may pay 
the $20 fee each quarter without 
seeing a new facility . Furthermore, 
this fee would create another 
campus-based fee for UCSD, 
which is already the second-
highest priced school in the UC 
system. 
6) Constitutional Convention Re-
ferendum Question: 

"Do you reque t the '89-'90 
See REFERENDA, pace 8 

Bankhead aid that, "Because 
of Proposition 98 and the Gann 
spending limit, the University of 
California budget is being 
squeezed . In the face of that , the 
UC does not want any limit 
placed on its ability to increa e 
[student] fees ." 

Bankhead said that the Univer-
sity was an important part of the 
Sunset Review Committee's con-
ensus and without their upport 

it will be an uphill battle. 
"But we are still very optimis-

tic," she said. "There is still a lot of 
broad-based support for the prin-
ciples of the bill from the [Cali-
fornia State] governor on down." 

UCSA Vice President Norman 
Tien feels that because of the 
University'S opposition, an exten-
sion of the current fee policy is 
"very unlikely." 

Tien said that "the bill may not 
go to the legislature because of 
effective UC blocking in the 
committee stage." 

He went on to note that there 
are many alternative options to

hearing process that violated his 
student rights. 

Counseling attorney Carrie 
Wil on, of Student Legal Servi-

is a problem with the current 
sys tem. 

Her position exists , she aid, to 
represent and advise students in 
legal conflicts . If the stude nts' 
conflicts are with the University, 
she added, they cannot take legal 
action on the students' behalf, 
and are limited to giving informal

advice. 

Wilson can represent students 
who have legal problems relating 
to, for instance, traffic violations 
or lease agreements. She told the 
council , however , that the Uni-
versity perceives it as a "connict 
of interests" for her to intervene 
on behalf of a student opposing 
the UC system. 

Currently, she said, students 
are at a disadvantage because 

ECE Dept. Gets $1.8 Million 
Gift of Hardware, Software 
By SCOTT LANTERMAN 
Contributing Writer 

A total of $1 .8 million in state-
of-the-art software and hardware 
has been donated to the electrical 
and computer engineering (ECE) 
department by Mentor Graphics 
Corp. and Apollo Computer Inc. 
to train undergraduate and grad-
uate students in computer-aided 
design of Very Large Scale Inte-
grated (VLS I) circuits. 

"Few universities have com-
parably powerful packages of 
hardware and software," Paul 
Chau, assistant professor of elec-
trical and computer science, aid. 

According to him, the equip-
ment was given to UCSD because 
San Diego is seen as a growth 
area by corporations . 

"Silicon Valley and the L.A. 
area are already well saturated 
with high technology companies," 
Chau said, explaining that , "For 
industry, students who have ex-
perience with such tate-of-the-
art industrial co mputer-aided de-
sign tools are hard to find. 

"This puts UCSD graduates in 
an advantageous position in the 
job market," he continued, "and 
satisfies a need of industry. I am 
very pleased t hat industry is sup-
porting undergraduate and grad-
uate education and resea rch." 

The system itself makes a model 
of a chip that can be designed and 
tested within minutes by the user , 
greatly speeding up the develop-
ment of new chips. 

"Prior to the gift, enrollments 
in VLSI courses had to be re-
stricted primarily to graduate stu-
dents because of a limited number 
of work stations," said M. Lea 
Rudee, dean of the division of 
engineering. "Now, enrollments 
can be expanded to include un-
dergraduate students. This also 
gives a big boost to the VLSI 
design research in the ECE depart-
ment of UCSD." 

"The ECE department is a fairly 
new, up and coming group. We 
are striving for excellence. The 
work stations will help support 
this growth," Chau said. 

"To build more complex [com-

puter] chips you need more com-
plex tools." Chau said. 

He added that many universi-
ties have similar systems, but very 
few institutions have the same 
state-of-the-art equipment. 

According to Chau , the design 
of the VLSI chips requires the use 
of computer-aided design systems 
because the thousands of compo-
nents in a chip resemble the net-
work of streets in a city. 

Chau expressed gratitude for 
the form of the donation to his 
department . 

"Research is so expensive, the 
University does not have unlim-
ited resources. The main resour-
ces are students. Donations such 
as this are very generous, as they 
are in the spirit of mutual cooper-
ation," Chau said. 

The systems, according to under-
graduate system user Brita Olson, 
"Will really help students be 
competitive in the job market. 
The system creates an environ-
ment that allows you to change 
parameters and quickly run [test] 
the circuit." 

. most of them cannot afford out-
side legal help, and she is unable 
to directly assist them. She said 
she ees two to three students per 
week who would benefit from an 
A.S.-hired lawyer. 

After hearing arguments by 
Finlan and Wilson, the Council 
approved a measure to allocate 
$9,733.03 from Mandated Re-
serves to cover Assorted Vinyl's 
current deficit. 

The Council has allocated al-
most $50.000 to Assorted Vinyl 
since the beginning of the school 
year. Most of the money, said 
Vice President-Finance Eduardo 
Rallo Verdugo, has gone towards 
new equipment the enterprise will 
need at its new location in the 
University Center. 

Programming Commissioner 
Jonathan Judaken spoke in favor 
of the proposal, saying that si nce 
the Council had already allocated 
so much money for the record 
store. they were committed to see-

Hunter S. Thompson 
Fun at The Drive-In 

Editors note: The following is a .. Best of Hunter S. Thompson" 
column. It was originally published in December /985. 

H OME MEDICINE IS a big industry these days. A recent network survey by one of the major evangelical organization indicated that one out of every three Americans will experi-
ment this year with a variety of do-it-yourself home cures and quack 
remedies ranging from self-i nduced vomiti ng kits to alpha-beta brain 
wave scan and multihead, blood-magneto suct ion-drums to measure 
percentage of true body fat. 

Others will test themselves daily, in towns and ghettos all over the 
republic, for potentially fatal levels of blood glucose, or use st range and 
expensive Iitmu tests to creen each other for leg cancer in the femurs 
and the ankles and knee . 

We are all slave to thi yndrome, but in orne way it is a far, far 
better thing ... Last aturday night I went out to the snack bar at the 
Geneva Drive-In near the Cow Palace and performed tests on a 
random selection of customers during the intermission period between 
" Rocky I V" and "Pale Rider." 

The results were tartling ... 
Huge brains, small necks, weak muscles and fat wallets - these are 

the dominant physical characteri tics of the '80 ... The Generation of 
Swine. 

"Rocky IV" runs about 91 minutes, but it seems more like 19 or 20. 
We had barely settled in - a flagon of iced Near Beer and a full 
dinner of Spicy Hot nugget from the Kentucky Fried Chicken people 
in lower Daly City - when a serie of horrible beatings climaxed 
abruptly in a frenzy of teen-age polit ical blather from Sylvester Stal-
lone, and then the movie wa over. 

The only excitement came when Sly beat the huge Russky like a 
mule and the whole crowd of fog-windowed cars in the audience, a it 
were, came alive with a blast of honking horns and harsh screams. 

I joined in, leaning heavily on the horn of my fully loaded Camaro, 
but when I tried to get out of the car and peak eriously with the other 
patron I wa menaced by a pack of wild dogs that had gathered 
around my car to gnaw on the fresh chicken bones. 

I kicked one in the throat and seized another by the forelegs and 
bashed it against a nearby Datsun pickUp with three women in the 
front seat. One of them rolled down the window and cursed me as the 
truck roared suddenly into action and screeched off in low gear, 
ripping the cheap metal peaker out by the roots ... 

1 moved the Camaro a few rows away and fled back through the 
darkness to the snack bar, where 1 found the heart-rate machine. 

The directions were clear enough: "Deposit 25 cents and insert 
middle finger. As a rule the lower your heart rate, the better your 
physical condition." 

It had the look of state-of-the-art medical technology, a complex 
digital readout with ominous red numbers on a calc from 60 to 100. 
Anything under 60 was "athletic"; 60 to 70 was "well-conditioned"; 70 
to 85 was "average"; and after that it got grim. 

Between 85 and 100 was "below average," and over 100 said, "Inac-
tive - consult your physician." 

I tested Maria first, and she came in at 91, which shocked even casual 
onlookers. She wept openly, attracting the focus of a large crew-cut 
uniformed cop who said his name was Ray and asked me for some 
" personal or professional I D." 

I had none. My attorney had run off, the night belore, with all my 
credentials and press cards. 

.. evermind that, Ray. Give me your hand," I said to him. "I need 
some human number for the ba eline." 

M EA WHILE, I HAD laid my own middle finger into the slot and come up with a reading of 64, which visibly impressed 
the crowd. They moaned and ja bbered distractedly as Ray 

moved into position, looking as spiffy and bristly and confident as a 
middle-aged fighting bull. 1 slapped another quarter into the lot and 
watched the test pattern seek out his number. 

It was 105, and a hush fell over the crowd. Ray slumped in his 
Uniform and muttered that he had to go out and check the lot for dope 
fiends and perverts and drunks.

Maria had locked her~elf in the ladles' room and now I had nothing to 
work with except a few vagrant children. 

I grabbed a small blonde girl who said she was I 0 year~ old and led 
her up to the machine. 'Tm a doctor," I told her. "I need your help with 
this experiment." 

She moved obediently into position and put her finger into the slot.

Her little sister spat at me as they backed away like animals. 
I grabbed another one, a fat young lad named Joe, who turned out to

Little Joe registered 126, a number so high that the machine offered 
no explanation for it. I gave him a quarter to go off and play the 
Donkey Kong machine on the other side of the aisle.

Editor: 

This letter is in respon e to the 
article, " Regents Approve Con-
struction Projects." (Guardian, 
April 3) 1 am writing specifically 
about the mention of the new 
Sciences building to be built be-
tween Urey Hall and the Main 
Gym. At first, 1 thought this was 
maybe an elaborate April Fool's 
joke, but I saw no indication as 
such, even though I don't recall 
ever hearing about such a build-
ing. 

The purpose of this letter is to 
protest the location of this build-
ing. When I started school here, 
the newest building on campus 
was thc Warren Apartment com-
plex. Since then, the administra-
tion of this University seem to 
have taken on a concerted effort 
to destroy the peaceful character 
that I remember so well. 

There is absolutely no concern 
as to the location of any building 
erected on the campus, so long as 
it i~ done. To place a building in 
yet another green area that "fits" 
with its surroundings seems blas-
phemous to say the least, to what 
was once a well-respected master 
plan. 

I suppose, however, we will be 
promised now, in the name of 
appea ement, that no more will 
this happen, that this i the last 
tree to be torn down, we promise. 
Just as troubling, however, is that 
particular emphasis on research. 
Qu ickly now, how many new 
classrooms can you identify that 
were built since 1984? A cursory 
glance at this campus reveals that, 
yes, it is true, none were built. 
Despite the massive Engineering 
Building, the Magnetic Record-
ing and Research Building, the 
electrifyingly aesthetic Charles 
Powell Structural Systems Facil-
ity, the Center for Molecular 
Genetics, the Price Center, sev-
eral other buildings now in con-
st ruction, and now the new Sci-
ences building. 

0, when you as a student just 
need to take that course to gradu-
ate, but can't add it because the 
largest classroom available holds 
on ly 30 students, or if you just 
wa nt to si t amongst the trees and 
relax after a hard day's studying, 
remem ber why you are not able 
to. 

The resources of this Unive(-
sity have been sq uandered away.

Triton Pub 
Countdown 
Editor: 

On April IS , 1989, the Triton 
Pub will close its doors forever. 
After seven years of conscientious 
service to the UCSD community, 
the contract between UCSD and 
Ed and Maryanne Davis, the co-
owners of the Pub, has been 
terminated. 

A Round Table Pizza franchise 
with a new license to sell beer and 
wine is set to open at an undeter-
mined time in the new Price Cen- ' 
ter. This means that there will be a 
time lag between the closing of 
the Pub and the opening of Round 
Table, leaving students and staff 
with no place to drink . 

The bid for the "Pub" was orig-
inally offered to the Davises, but 
Maryanne did not have approp-
ria te funds for the high-priced 
start-up costs because she had 
devoted her life savings to the 
initial purchase of the Triton Pub's 
equipment and owner hip rights . 

She also reasoned that keeping 
the Pub intact and competing 
with the corporate interests slated 
to open for business in the Price 
Center would not only be foolish, 
but also ve ry unprofitable. Be-
cause Maryanne is in such a com-
promised position, she stands to 
lose the majority of her $150,000 
initial investment. 

The Davises had brought 
entertainment back to campus on 
Fridays, with free live bands and 
a relaxed , fun atmosphere for 
students eager to unwind after a 

long week of tudying. 
On any given day, one who 

visited the Pub might have een a 
noted nutritionist having a beer 
with a priest, or a basketball 
coach playing PacMan next to a 
group of fraternity guys hollering, 
or a game of Foosball. 

Whenever you see Maryanne 
standing and observing the crowd 
of Pub-goers wearing her "have 
fun - behave" expression, you 
could be sure that she was genuine 
in her desire for the students' 
enjoyment. 

She is a woman whose busines 
philo ophy has always been to 
create an environment that best 
served her patrons, with the 
knowledge that one day her efforts 
would be rewarded when she 
retired and sold the Pub. 1 can 
attest to her hone ty and personal 
integrity because 1 am her daugh-
ter, and have known her for 31 
year , for seven of which she has 
been my employer. 

Those who know me have 
observed my 72 day-long Count-
down Calendar vigil, and have 
joined me in wearing the calen-
dars on Fridays when the new editions 
came out (many thanks, Koala). 
In honor of my mom, and to 
show that the students of UCSD 
are aware of the poli tics involved 
with obtaining positions in the 
new Price Center, join me this 
Friday, April 7, by pinning on a 
special-edition Pub Cou ntdown 
Calendar available at numerous 
locat ions around the Student 
Center, at the major libraries, and 
wherever cool things are found . 

Thank you for your upport ,

Q and A: In light of the Exxon oil tanker spill in Alaska, what do you think 
should be done to prevent similar catastrophes in the future? 

Besides tighter regulations 
and controls, all tankers 
should be required to be of 
the double-hull type, which 
would probably have pre-
vented the spill, A lso, com-
panies should scrutinize 
crews more often for drink-

UCSD Co-Founder Performs 
International Public Service 

By MARLA SCHNEIDMAN 
Staff Writer 

R oger Revelle, director em-eritus of Scripp Institute 
of Oceanography and pro-

fessor of science and public pol-
icy at UCSD, has spent much of 
his life acting internationally in 
the field of science and human 
relations. As a member ofthe dis-
tinguished National Academy of 
Science , he i considered one of 
the country's most eminent scien-
tists who e contribut ions have en-
riched many of the institutions in 
the scientific and public commun-
itie . 

He has received numerous 
awards for hi involvement in 
science, higher education , and 
community service. Revelle has 
also received honorary degrees 
from more than a dozen univer-
sities. 

I n the early 1950s, Revelle be-
became one of the first scientists 
to recognize the possibilities of 
the "greenhouse effect." He is also 
one of the founding fathers of 
UCSD whose dedication and hard 
work helped lay the groundwork 
for building UCSD into one of 
the top 20 ranking universities in 
the U.S., a well as one of the top 
five universitie to receive funding 

for scientific research in the na-
tion. 

Born in Seattle. Washington in 
1909, Revelle was raised chiefly in 
Pasadena. He earned his B.A. in 
geology from Pomona College in 
1929 and his Ph.D. in oceano-
graphy from the University of 
California in 1936. 

'Building a university 
is just the opposite of 
building a house - it 
must be done from 
the top down, not the 
bottom Up.' 

-Roger Revelle 

Originally, Revelle wanted to 
be a journalist. "While attending 
high school in Pasadena, I had 
been on the editorial staff of the 
student newspaper, but in my 
sophomore year of college I took 
an elementary geology course 
from an inspired teacher. Alfred 
O. Woodford, " Revelle explained. 

From that moment on, Revelle 
became a devoted scientist who 
demonstrated that science and 
humanism are compatible. He 
became world-renowned for bring-

ing scientific and social issues to 
the public arena. 

As an avid oceanographer, 
Revelle was appointed director of 
the Scripps I nstitute of Oceano-
graphy from 1950-1964. During 
this time, he felt that the 150 
graduate students were isolated 
from an academic environment. 

"I pushed for a graduate school 
of science and engineering so stu-
dents could learn more about 
cience," he said. 

In I 958, Revelle persuaded the 
Scripps board of directors to 
establish an institute of technol-
ogy and engineering. They situ-
ated it in the wooded areas of the 
former marine base above the 
oceanographic laboratories, the 
present site ofUCSD. A few years 
later, it was decided that the insti-
tute would be converted into a 
general campus. 

Revelle had set the tone. As a 
top scientist himself, he was able 
to better judge people in the scien-
tific arena. Since Scripps had a 
good reputation, it wasn't diffi-
cult finding top-rated scientists. 

From day one, Revelle set out 
to recruit the best. He lured such 
notables as the nobel prize win-
ning chemist Harold Urey and 
other members of the National 
Academy of Scientists. 

When the graduate school 
opened in 1960, other top scien-
tists came to La Jolla, creating a 
strong scientific community. 

For Revelle, the strength of a 
university comes from building it 
"top down." 

"Building a university is just the 
opposite of building a house - it 
must be done from the top down, 
not the bottom up - from the 
inside out, not the outside in," he 
said . The graduate programs in 
physics, chemistry, and biology as 
well as math, history, linguistics, 
economics, psychology, literature, 
and the earth sciences were well 
established before the admittance 
of the first undergraduates in 1964. 

As a tribute to the educator and 
scientist, the first college at UCSD 
was renamed Revelle College. 

Roger Revelle. former director of the Scripps Institute of Oceano-
graphy and one of the University's founding fathers. recently cele-
brated his 80th birthday at Revelle Plaza. 

Though Revelle College has 
gained a reputation for being 
science-oriented, there are many 
students who major in other sub-
jects. "Bright students go to Re-
velle and a lot of them major in 
science. The fact is, however, a lot 
of students major in humanities 
and social sciences," Revelle said. 

When asked about the future 
of UCSD, Revelle commented on 
the tremendous growth potential 
that increased funding and state 
support allow. He mentioned that 
when Ronald Reagan was gover-
nor, the University did not grow 
because Reagan thought the Uni-
versity was too radical. When 
Edmund G. Brown was governor, 
he thought the campus too elite 
and "not for the common man," 
Revelle said. 

Revelle believes that a consist-
ently good faculty which main-
tains the balance between research 
and teaching will continue to con-
tribute to the fine academic en-
vironment. 

"What will continue to make 
this University superior is to 
attract programs which are not 
usually available at other institu-
tions. For example, we are con-
sidering a graduate school of 
government which is different 
from law school ... A school of 
government focuses on the admin-
istrative and legislative aspects 
of government, while law school 
teaches the technology of all kinds 
of law. A school of government is 
essential because most politics is 
on a state and local level and 
many important positions are 
available at these levels," he said. 

Revelle also mentioned the 
possibilities for the creation of 
graduate sc hools of business, 
public health, and journalism. 

Revelle does, however, see 
problems in UCSD's future.

"Party Smart Day" yesterday to promote the Interfraternity 
Councll's first dry rush. 

"The goal of students in Revelle 
College should be to learn how to 
learn," Revelle said. He feels it is 
important for the students to get 
some taste in all fields of learning, 
and the Revelle College program 
offers students a chance to explore 
a variety of classes. 

"We were very fortunate to be 
chosen as the site for the new 
International Relations Graduate 
School," Revelle said. 

"The main problem we are fac-
ing today is that the early faculty 
we hired is getting ready to retire. 
We are faced with the tough job 
of finding new faculty members," 
he said. 

Revelle explained that there is

Being, and is currently working 
on a violin concerto and a vocal 
piece based on a Samuel Beckett 
text. If there is a common thread 
to his music, said Reynolds , it 
would be "dramatic intensity," 

"He's a complete, avant-garde 
composer," said Peter Farrell, 
chairperson of the music depart-
ment, 

The award-winning piece was 
Reynolds' response to a 1975 John 
Ashbery poem, itself a 1976 Pul-
itzer Prize winner. 

"The way I understand things 
best is by ex ploring them musi-
cally," Reynolds explained. 

The music regards "the rela-
tionship an artist has with himself 
and with his time and society," he 
said, adding that, " I've always 

thought a great deal about the 
impact an artist has in his or her 
time - and the power he [or she) 
has to reach across different 
times, " 

Reynolds began studying music 
relatively late, at age 14. Upon 
graduation from high school, "it 
wasn't overwhelmingly clear that 
it was thethingto do, "and instead 
he studied engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He worked 
for several months as an engineer, 
but didn't like the "constraints on 
individual initiative" it held, and 
derived more satisfaction from 
playing piano at night than from 
his job. He returned to the Uni-
versity of Michigan to earn a 
Masters degree in music, and 
wrote his first composition at age 
25,

21-6 Softball Ranked 
Fourth in the Nation 

Men's Water Polo Attempts to Top 
Guinness Record for Longest Game 

By BRIAN lTOW 
Staff Wriler 

UC D has carved its niche 
as one of the top Division III 
teams in the nation, and with 
its fou rth place fi nish in the 
Cal State Haywa rd Tourna-
ment, the Tritons have shown 
t hat t hey ca n play with anyone 
in.Division II as well. 

T he Tritons opened pool 
play in the tournament with a 
4-0 shutout of CSU San Ber-
nardino, their third straight win 
over t he Division III rival afte r 
sweeping a pair in their own 
"Trito n Tri" tourney. The 
Triton were led by the pitch-
ing of first-: ea r sta ndout 
Dianna Moreno. 

Next, they snuck by CS U 
ta nislaus 2-0. The win was 

the Tritons' second in three 
tries aga inst the Division III 
powerhouse. They had split a 
pair earlier at the "Triton Tri." 

Afte r defeating La Verne 2- 1 
and Red lands 3-0 10 capture 
the top seed emerging from 
pool play, the Tr itons faced 
their first Division lI te t of the 
tourney. It proved no test 
whatsoever as the Tritons rip-
ped Portland 10-0. 

UCSD then edged Division 
II Chapman College 2-1 to 
advance to the tournament 
emi-finals.ln the third inning, 

Dana Chaiken, who leads the 
team with a .444 average , lead 
off with a line single. Bunted 
to second by Debbie Bran tel-
ter, Chaiken cored on a two-
out base hit by Tracey Kehr. 
After C hapman tied the game 
in the fourth, the Tri tons ra l-
lied as Branstelter drove in 
Pam Harnack from seco nd 
ba e with the winning run. 

In the emifinals, UCSD 
played tough against four-time 
Division II ational Champions 
CS U 10rthridge. but fell short 
1-0. 

" For us to have played them 
well only looks good to the 
Regional Selection Commit-
tee ," Coach Lisa Bassi said . 
" We were quite pleased with 
our performance." 

In the third place game, the 
Tritons were edged by Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, another top 
10 Division II team. UCSD 
opened the scoring in the top 
of the fift h inning wit h Dana 
Chaiken coring on a sacrifi ce

Can they do it? Fourteen mem-
bers of UCSD's men's intercolle-
giate water polo team will attempt 
to break the world record for the 
longest continuous game next Sat-
urday and Sunday, April 8 and 9. 
The current record , according to 
the Guinness Book of World 
Records, is 25 ho urs. 36 minutes. 
The record was set in 1986 by a 
boys' water polo tea m from Shrews-
bury School in chropshire, Eng-
land . 

Triton Head Coach Denny 
Harper said his team will begin 
play at 1:15 p.m. on Saturday, 
April 8. The team 's goal is to play 
continuously until 3: 15 p.m. the 
following day, a total of26 hours. 

According to the rules. two 
teams must play seven-on-seven 
water polo, without substitutions, 
throughout the 26-hour period. 
No players are allowed to leave 
the pool, except for five-minute 
breaks every hour. Another option 
is to play continuously and let the 
break time accumulate, which is 
what Harper is planning to do. 

Harper intends to play his teams 
for four traight hours at the 
beginning, and then take a 20-
minute break. After that , he plans 
to execute another four-hour, 20-

Mens Tennis Wins Three in Arizona 
By BRIAN now 
Siaff Writer 

Six of the nation's top 12 Div-
ision III men ' tennis team ga th-
ered amid sweltering condi tions 
at the Western Reserve Club in 
Tempe, Arizona last weekend . 
The Tri tons, however, did not 
cool off as they won three of four 
matches to further their chances 
of earning a bid to the CAA 
"Jational Tournament. 

The Phoenix area club brought 
some of t he top Division III talent 

together to playa series of d ual 
matches on a neutral court in 
what could very well have been a 
preview of next month's ational 
Cham pionships. 

The fifth ranked Tritons open-
ed play with a tight 5-4 victory 
over eighth ranked Gustav us 
Adolphus College. Leadmg 4-2 
after thei r singles matches, the 
Tritons d ropped two tough dou-
bles matches and seemed on the 
verge of an upset loss before thei r 
No.2 dou bles team of Jeff Fre nch 
and Fra ncois Monnar won a 
third-set tiebreaker to sea l the 
victory.

Cruz, 6-3. o. 5 singles player 
John Park and the No. I doubles 
team of Sig Huber a nd Chris Bel-
loli both lost close matches tha t 
could have given the Tritons t he 
victory. 

"The loss was encouraging, ~ 
UCS D Coach Jon Ha mmermeis-
ter sa id . " We played ve ry well 
versus Santa Cruz a nd could very 
well have won the match. I think 

we proved we can play with any 
team in Division HI." 

After the tough loss, the Trit-
ons were forced to face 12th 
ranked SI. Thomas College and 
showed their mettle, routing them 
9-0. In winning, the Tritons only 
dropped one set as Monnar was 
forced to play three sets to gain 
the victory. 

"St. Thomas wasn't a bad team," 
Hammermeister said . "We were 
j ust in a real groove the entire 
trip. " 

In their only match against an 
unranked school, the Tritons beat 
up on Colorado College, 6-0. Once 
again they dropped just one set. 
This time, it was Park who found 
himself down 1-6, 1-3 before rally-
ing to a 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory. 

With the win, the Tritons suc-
cessfully completed their first big 
test in Division II I. They took 
three of four matches from some 
of the best teams in the nation and 
enhanced their chances of landing 
a bid in the 10-team ational

Volleyball Sweeps Chapman -
By AC. LEE 
Staff Wriler 

Records can be very mis-
leading. Take the Triton men's 
volleyball team as an example; 
it is 5- 14 but is still ranked 20th 
in the nation and favored to 
win the Pacific Coast Confer-
ence Championships at the end 
of the season. 

The Tritons ' 1989 sea~on 
schedule has been the most 
ambitious and challenging of 
Head Coach Digger Graybill's 
career. The schedule includes 
such powerhouse Division 1 
teams as Pepperdine, Cal Sate 
Long Beach, UC Irvine, Stan-
ford , and Cal State North-
ridge. In fact, all of the Tritons' 
losses have been against higher-
ranked teams. 

"The team has actually been 
playing pretty well, consider-
ing that most of our opponents 
give scholarships to their play-
ers," Graybill said . 

Tuesday, the Tritons got a 
chance to playa more evenly 
matched team and they de-
feated Division II Chapman 
College in three straight games, 
15-5, 15-6, 15-5. 

UCSD dominated the entire 
match and never really gave 

Chapman College an oppor-
tunity to get back into it. "We 
had control and never felt 
threatened throughout the 
whole game," Graybill said . 

Setter John Lee played an 
outstanding game in place of 
regular starter John Childers 
who was out with the flu. Lee 
made all the assists in the game 
and collected five digs. Middle 
attacker John Lim also played 
extremely well , smashing a 
total of 10 kills and ending the 
game with an impressive attack 
percentage of .750. 

The victory over Chapman 
was crucial because it was the 
first game of the Pacific Coast 
Conference tha t wiillater deter-
mine seeds for the Conference 
Championships. 

Backcourt defense is the 
strong point of the Triton team, 
and it showed on Monday 
when UCSDthoroughlydom-
inat.;:d Eastern Montana Col-
lege 15-0, 15-0, 15-0. 

The game took no more 
than 35 minutes to play and 
the defense did not surrender 
one kill the ent ire night. Nick 
Rothman, who is currently 
ranked sixth in the nation in 
digs, has been a key player of 
the Triton defense. 

UCSD will travel to face 
Stanford on Friday night.

LAW AND SOCIETY 
Interdisciplinary Minor 

Program oj Concentration 
Area Study 

L aw and Society is an interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the complexity and interrelationship of legal, 
social and ethical issues in their historical context. The Law 

and Society minor / program is available to all UCS D students with 
a general interest in law as a social institution as well as to students 
considering law-related careers. The purpose of the program is to 
enhance students' critical analysis of social and ethical issues related 
to law and of the legal implications and ramifications of policy and 
decision-making in their fields. To insure an interdisciplinary learn-
ing experience, students must include in their program at least one 
course from each of the following "core" academic departments: 
History, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology. 

B ecause each college has different general education require-ments, students should contact an academic advisor in their 
college to see how the Law and Society Program can best

"They've been eating pasta three

steady diet of carbohydrate to 
prepare for the event. "So they're 
going to be ready. I'm pretty con-

HEAL TN CARE - SOCIAL ISSUES 
Interdisciplinary Minor 

Program of Concentration 
Area Study 

THE HEALTH CARE-SOCIAL ISSUES PROGRAM offers 
students a variety of perspectives that enhance their ability to 
deal with complex social and ethical issues in modem health 
care. This program is available to all UCSD students with a 
general interest in issues related to health care as well as to stu-
dents considering health care careers. By bringing together 
coursework from a number of academic departments, this inter-
disciplinary curriculum complements science majors and enriches 
students' preparation for professional and postgraduate 
education. 

BECAUSE EACH COLLEGE has different general education 
requirements, students should contact an academic advisor in 
their college to see how the Health Care-Social Issues Program 
can best meet their college's general education requirements. 
Students who complete the program but do not use it for a 
minor, program of concentration or area study, may elect to 
have a special notation on their transcript certifying their 
completion of the program. 

Information on specific requirements, declarations, petitions, and 
transcript notation requests, may be obtained at 405 MAAC 
(across the parking lot from the Warren Provost's Office) or 
phone 534-1704.

had a great chance to take the 
lead with runner at second and 
third and nobody out. But UC 0 
could n01 score in their half of the 
inning and the Mustangs scored 
on a one-out error by Chaiken to 
win the game. 

The Tritons (21-6) finished 
fourth in the tournament and 
solidified their hold on a playoff 
berth. Ranked second in the 
region and fourth in the nation, a 
berth in the We tern Regional 
Finals seem fairly secure. They 
took two of three from CS U Sta-

PHIL'S ANALYS IS ... First things first. I don't 
know about you, but when I think of fund raiser, one 
of the first things that come to mind is, of course, 
playing a seven~on~seven water polo game for 26 
straight hours. The UCSD men's water polo team 
took my idea and will attempt the record~b reaking 
feat this weekend in the Natatorium. Can it be done? 
Will they endure with only an average of five minutes 
to break every hour? The odds say no, but ['m going to 
have to say yes for a couple of reasons. One: These 
players are great athletes and have been on special 
diets the entire week just for this event. Two: They're 
much bigger than me. Against all odds, Phil advises

Indoor soccer has become one of 
the most popular sports in the country. 
The outdoor game never seems to 
catch on, but this Americanized indoor 
version of soccer has really caught on. 

Here at UCSD we transform the Rec 
Gym into a soccer arena and have a 
weekend tournament of fun and thrills. 
The tournament will be held the week-
end of May 13 & 14 and WIll cost $10 
per team. 

We have been asked many times by 
our students to Institute an mdoor 
soccer league that runs the entire 
quarter Untortunately our gym doesn 't 
have the space We would need a new 
gymnasium, but that may never happen. 
It's hard to believe we are the only UC 

us Without a major gym. Well, I 
gues we 'll always remain little 01' 

With no indoor soccer feague.

MAKE ROOM FOR CROWDED HOUSE 

Crowded House, known for their 
outstanding live performances, will 
play in the UCSD Gym this Saturday 
night at 8 p.m. Their latest album, the 
moody and deep Temple of Low 
Men, marks the band's growth and 
maturation as musicians. This tour jux-
taposes Crowded House's new-found 
maturity with their reputation as zany, 
crazy performers to create a very 
intriguing show tainted with surreal 
and interesting lyrics, 

The trio of Neil Finn, vocals, 
guitar; Nick Seymour, bass; and Paul 
Hester on drums, fused from the fis-
sion of Split Enz, to form a band 
with a sense of humor seen both

TEMPLE OF LOW MEN 
BREAKS SLUMP BLUES 

The sophomore slump. This is rhe blues often 
sung by artists who face the problem of producing a 
second album that stands up to their debut effort. 
Bands are often pressured into quickly releasing an 
album on rhe heels of a tour supporting their jnitial 
work. Usually the album is weak either musically or 
lyrically, and is crucified by the critics. 

Not so with the latest release from Crowded 
fbuse, Temple of Low Men. Described by Rolling 
Stone as "darker and moodier than its predeces-
sor, " it was pointed out that "while it takes longer 
to appreciate, in the long run, it's probably a 
deeper, more rewarding record." 

"Better be Home Soon," the first single released 
off the album, was thought to be a smash hit. 
Unfortunately, it failed on Top 40 airplay, leaving 
the album struggling for sales. 

OJerall, the album is a more solid effort in com-
parison to their se/f-entitled debut album. Yet the 
album definitely has its cynical moments. In the cut 
"Mansion in the Slums," singer, songwriter, and 
guitarist Neil Finn describes the corruption some-
times associated with wealth. The taste of suc-
cess/ only lasts you half an hour/all thls/ boy, 
he loves you when It comes. 

Finn credits the stylistic change to the dark atti-
tude he experienced this past year. "Most of [the 
songs] are more personal, " he said. "They don't 
have a sense of place, particularly, because I've 
been uprooted from my home country for so long. 
People will find a lot of the songs pretty obscure, I 
think, bur rhe album kind of deals with the low end 
of human experience."

Amidstthe usual bustle within 
La Jolla's Hard Rock Cafe, a 
bizarre quintet stands out against 
the surrounding yuppie clien-
tele. With their kamikaze ap-
pearance, they seem unfazed by 
the roc k memorabilia gracing 
the walls. Perhaps it is because 
two of the members of Voice o f 
the Beehive have familial ties to 
some of those posters.

"That's the poster of my dad, 
The Four Preps one," Melissa . 
Brooke said in a recent inter-
view, Both Melissa and fier sis-
ter , Tracey Bryn. may have 
received inspiration from their 
father's work in the '50s, but it 
was their persistence that even-
tually created Voice of the 
Beehive. 

Originally from the Los 
Angeles area, the two sisters 
decided to try the British music 
scene in 1985. "A lot of our 

favorite bands were from Eng-
land: the Kinks, the Beatles, Led 
Zeppelin, the Sex Pistols," 
Brooke explained, "The whole 
punk movement came from 
England. In America, I couldn't 
even get into clubs, let alone get 
in to play, because of the age 
problem. So we just decided to 
move [to England] and give it a 
chance."

scene and its drinking age of 18,

Going BetlVeen 
Love Songs 

by patty jettie 
a88iltant arts editor 

There are some bands whose 
work revolves around a single 
theme, The Go-Betweens is such a 
band . For ten years, this Austral-
ian group has been recognized for 
its melodic love songs that allow 
the listener to decide just how 
deep o ne wants to delve. With 
their recent signing with Capi tol 
Records and current album ,6 
Wllers Lane, the Go-Betweens have 
once again created an engaging 
pop album. 

Initially ~ duo in 1978, they 
have grown into a five-member 
band. In a recent telephone inter-

view, drummer Lindy Morrison 
described the ba nd 's evolutio n 
into its current line-up. "Gran t 
[McLennan] and Rob [Forster] 
got it together in '78, alternating 
guitar and vocals. Grant was play-
ing bass then. I joined in 1980. 
Then Amanda[Brown] was added 
on strings. Now, we've got John 
[Willsteed ] on bass." 

Like many bands, the Go-
Betweens have found it difficult to 
settle on one specific label. Be'tause 
their style isn't incrediblv danca-
ble, they're "not exactly the band 
companies rush for," Morrison 
explained. "In Europe we're on 
Beggar 's Banqut't, in the U.S. it's

Poetic Hard Rock 
by laura baker 

hiatus writer 
Dr. Ro n hant: wants your attention . He is ~oin~ all o ut to gd it 

in tht: upcoming p...· rformanct.'s by his ht'3vy ml.'tal band, Ml'mal 
Anarchy. 

Promoting th t' concert as a " rock extravaga nZ:l," Shant.' prom-
ises an t.'xlXrience that WIll a P1)1.'a I to a wtdl.' rangl.' of intt.' rests, he it 
in thl.' immortal poetry o( Blah , hcll l.' y and hakespeare or in 
"beauttful sparsely clad women " danci ng "ero tica ll y with tan ta liz-
ing pulsati on." 

In the attempt to keep the Amen ca n mind (ro m cl os in~, hane, 
wh o had a Ph.D. in ro mantic pot' try (rom UC Sa nta Barbara, has 
dt'voted himself to takin~ c1as ic wo rks of litl.' raturl' and prCSl'nt-
ing th t: m in conventio nal artistic forms. 

For Mental Anarchy, he has rewritten th e works of va rious 
romantic poets and set thl'm to heavy mccal musIC. His purpose IS 
to create a performance, through music and erotic dan e, in whi h 
members of the audience can experience the cr<'ative energy 
within themselves. Ideally this is whatany artistic creation should 
do, but for Shane, hea vy metal is the only fo rm today that has thc 
<'nergy to transport o ne to this kind of transcendent state of being. 

This will be the premiere performance o f the band, whose 
nucleus is five members of the ro k band Stallion. Alon~ with the 
band on stage will be dancers performmg works choreographt'd 
by Brian Smith of the California Ballet Company as well as Shane 
himself, s inging back up vo als and narrating the meaning of his 
svngs. 

Performances are o n April 14 and 20 a t the East Coumy 
Performing Arts Ce nter. Tickets are $5 at the d oor. The available 
proceeds from these shows will be contributed to an artistic 
scholarshi fund at bo th SDSU and Grossmo nt Colle e .

on and off stage . Finn feels thatthe 
chemistry between the trio is suc-
cessful because "We have worked 
together for three years, we three 
have been through a lot, and we 
share the same sense of humor. 
We also have similar aesthetics as 
far as the way we want to hear the 
music sound. We 've really gelled 
and learned how to sing together. 
We don't see a lot of each other 
outside of the band. Maybe that's 
good too, because when we come 
together we have a lot of energy 
for the relationship."

Yet the relationship of being 
jokesters does have detrimental 
effects. "The one thing we were 
left feeling kind of annoyed about 
at the end of last year is that we 
had played that part of those 
wacky, zany guys from down under 
so willingly to so many people," 
Finn said. "It was a natural part of 
us, but we felt like we'd have to 
suffer that image forever. That is a 
pain in the ass, you know?" 

Album 
Continued from page 1 

Finn, along with bassist Nick 
Seymour and drummer Paul Hes-
ter , decided to entitle Temple of 
Low Men for partially serious rea-
sons. "We had noticed all these 
churches in Hollywood, and saw 
the phrase scrawled on the wall of 
o ne of them," Finn remembered. 
"Afterwards we saw Jimmy Swag-
gart on TV, apologizing to his 
congregation ... all these evange-
lists fl eecing the poor. So we felt 
the phrase wa perfect because it 
was like scumbags were inhabiting 

I some sacred place. 
"Mitchell Froom also produced 

our first album," Finn explained. 
"I think we understood each other 
this time better than we did last 
time. 1 think he understood more 
what the band has to offer, so this 
record has more of a band sound. 
Mitchell is a very musical person, 
he 's an ally in the creative process . 

"I have speci fic ideas about 
what 1 want. He has strong opin-
ions himself, and that 'S useful in 
the studio because it's easy to 
vacillate and go to and from on 
ideas. So at worst it means that if I 
disagree with him, I know that I 
have to be specific and definite 
about why."

Love Australian stud io, the ba nd com-pleted the album and evenrually rele<\l>ed it in July , 1988. 
In regard to their current album, 

"We chose the tirle ,6 Lovers Lane 
becau e of an idea we had, a pri-
vate place where people could 
escape [Q and make love," Mor-
rison said. "The whole album was 
based on thi sense of privacy 
between lovers." On vinyl, sin-
gers/ songwriters Mclennan and 
Forster's vocals blend into a musi-
cal sigh.

in Australia. We're the ones that 
pursue the companies, not vice 
versa. It 's kind of like band 'auc-
tioning' in a way. A lot of times 
we 've made the album before the 
company buys it." 

The band chose Mark Walis as 
the producer for ,6 Lovers Lane 
because "he's absolutely brilliant," 
Morrison claimed. " We worked 
with him previously when he re-
mixed some of the cuts on the last 
album [Tallulah). W e were really 
pleased with his work and he liked 
our style." Hidden away in an

simple pop songs, following the 
style of Roxy Music's A valon. 

Although the sungs are about 
love, the point of view tends to 
avoid si mplistic mushiness. Mc-
Lennan and Forster, who write 

The cuts on ,6 Lovers Lane flow 
along like the morning tide. There 
isn't an abrupt style change [Q 
emphasize the romanticism of the 
songs. Even so, the weaving guitar 
hooks, lilting string work, and 
understated drum beat create an 
aural landscape for the listener . 

Although many may dismiss 
the Go-Betweens as love-song 
lightweights, one has to admire a 
band that retains the same musical 
values initially chosen 10 years 
ago. 

Continued from page 3 
England allows young bands to 
ha ve easier acces to public expo-
sure. This also causes, however, 
an excessive amount of musical 
talent, leading to greater competi-
tion between bands and greater 
sense of trend following. If one 
band is succe sful, it is not long 
before the club sene is f1ocid~d 
with mass quantities of mimic 
groups. Although this intimidates 
many bands, Bro()kc claimed that 
the situation was inspirational. 

When the two sisters arrived, 
the trend " was very much the 

dark moveme nt, the Goth. with 
the white make-up and black hair, 
Brooke said. " When we lme 
onto the scene, with the huge 
dresse and the color and the 
bright, I think it got us noticed 
right away ." 

"The scene was packed, " 
Brooke reminisced. "Loads of 
bands, everyone playing, and eve-
ryonc 's really friends. Five bands 
would play at one club in one 
night, the best bands you 've ever 
seen, and then you go down the 
street and there 's four more 
bands."

Beehive 
Continued from page 6 

Joined by Mike Jones on guitar 
and keyboards, Voice of the Bee-
hive began to make an impression 
with their energetic live shows. 
The trio became a quintet when 
Woody (drums/percussion) and 
Mark Bedford (bass), former 
members of Madness, offered their 
recording services. Picked up by 
an independent label, Food 
Records, the band released the 
single "Just a City I! in mid-1986 . 

For Brooke, it was important to 
be initially signed onto an inde-
pendent record company instead 
of ro keting straight into a on-
tract with a major label. "It was 
important for people to know that 
we weren't some record company 
band, that we'll take the girlies and 
put them in a band," Brooke 
explained. " When we switched to 
a maj r label we wanted to ay, 
'Look, there are 1,500 kids that 
are freaking about u and if you 
aren't going to sign us, then it's 
your own problem.' W e wanted 
to have the leverage to say we've 
done a lot already , we 've been on 
an indi label already, we know 
what we want, we know what 
we're doing. And it gave us more 
control when we we finally did go 
on a major." 

Admittedly, Voice of the Bee-
hive did not jet into commercial 
success overnight. Although Food 
paid for the recording of their first 
single, the band members had to 
provide their own living expenses. 
They experienced some diffi ult 
times. Brooke remembers living 
"in a vacant house, for a year and a 
half, with no window and no 
doors, with five biker guy ." 

"Just a City" began rising up 
the British independent charts and 
the band was soon approached by 
London/Polygram. The band 
eventually signed with this label 
because they did not attempt to 
categorize Voice of the Beehive as 
the typical glll,mour band. "I think 
the indi following helped [pre-
vent] that and also our record 
lahel has Bananarama," Brooke 
said. "They have got the tits and 
ass covered. They've got plenty of 

cle~vage and plenty of short skirts. 
They don't need it from us. They 
don't tell us what to wear, they 
don't tell us what to sing." 

In England, many classify Voice 
of the Beehive as "bubble-gum 
punk." Brooke describes their 
sound as "crystal clear pop, sugar-
sugar, like pop-written punk. It's 
got both sides. I would just say [it 
is] manic, manic pop." 

After Martin Brett replaced 
Bedford on bass, Voi e of the 
Beehive began recording their 
recently released Let It Bee. Stylis-
tically, the album is an example of 
a new breed of pop. Although 
Bryn and Brooke alternate vo als, 
the Iyri s tend to stay away from 
the mushy love tributes displayed 
by many female pop vocalists . 
Especially with Bryn, the person-
ality of the singer often gives the 
song a cynical edge, as in "Trust 
Me": She's saved it all this time/But 
to him it's warth a dime/ he found 
out the hard way you get the kisses 
t/u.'1l the tears. 

"I think that the reason we 
sound different is that we have a 
real British band," Brooke ex-
plained. "All the boys are British, 
and the British guitar sound is 
really raw and really chunky. Then 
you have these sweet vocals over 
this hunky guitar. I think that 
mo t bands are either sweet like 
the Bangl or rough like X. It's 
hard to find bands with both ."
