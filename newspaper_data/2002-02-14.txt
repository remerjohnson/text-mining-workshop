Marshall students plan 
D.O.C. ledure walk-out 
Students to .rally for changes in housing 
practices at Marshall residences 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students at Thurgood 
Marshall College plan to stage a 
protest during their Dimensions 
of Culture classes Feb. IS, accord-
ing to a Web site created anony-
mously in response to what stu-
dents call unfair housing treat-
ment at Mar hall. 

The Web site, bttP://WWW.gfoc-
ities.com/ucsdcQlIse, claims Marshall 
college's Residential Life Office is 
taking part in a "conspira.:y to ter-
minate housing contracts," among 
other things. . 

The UCSD Cause site trou-
bled the Marshall Deans Office, 
resulting in a meeting between 
Marshall Dean of Student Affairs 
Ashanti Houston-Hands and 

Marshall freshman Danny 
Leibowitz, who was one of the 
organizers of the movement. 

"They really wanted to meet 
with us and find a compromise," 
Leibowitz said . 

Leibowitz said that since his 
meeting Monday with Houston-
Hands, the students will be "ton-
ing down the protest and making 
it more of an information session," 
so that students can be aware of 
their rights. 

Leibowitz emphasized that his 
meeting with Houston-Hands was 
the original goal of organizing the 
protest, along. with attracting the 
attention of Marshall students and 
making them aware of their rights 
as students in Marshall. 

"We used the protest as a way 
to get through the Residential 

Life Office and go the next step up 
the ladder," he aid . "Mostly, the 
conspiracy was just a way for liS to 
get people's attention. We're not 
tryi ng to destroy the sc hool. 
We're trying to make it nicer." 

The meeting was viewed a a 
successful negoti a ti on by both 
Leibowitz and Houston-Hands. 

"We came to an understanding 
and are going to work on getting 
some new rules drafted, and some 
new consequence'," Leibowitz 
said. 

Houston-I lands said that it is 
important that the two met 
because it allowed them to talk 
about "how we ca n go about VOIC-
ing some of the concerns that stu-
dents have."

Police chase drunk driver; 
ends in crash at Blake Hall 
Driver runs SUV into residence hall after the San 
Diego Police Dept. chased the car onto campus 
By BRYCE WARWICK 
Contributing Writer 

A UCSD student crashed his 
2002 Ford Explorer into Blake Hall 
at the conclusion of a San Diego 
Police Department chase at 12 :50 
a.m. on Feb. 8, awakening ReveJ.le 
students. 

According to officer Michael 
James of the SDPD, a routine acci-

. dent investigation was taking place 
on North Torrey Pines Road when 
the Explorer drove by. The driver 
turned off his lights, arousing the 
suspicion of the SDPD. 

Officers pulled in behind the car 
and turned on their lights and 
sirens in an attempt to pull him 
over, James said. At this point, the 
driver began driving erratically and

Preuss students seek donations 
for robot competition 

Students at The Preuss School at UCSD are 
attempting to raise $75,000 to submit an entry in 
the 2002 For Inspiration and Recognition of Science 
and Technology robot-building competition to be 
held in Rorida. If the fundraising and construction is 
successful, the Preuss entry will be the first ever 
from the San Diego area. 

Around 140 pounds of machinery will be used in 
the construction of the remote-controlled robot. 
Students have been working since January on the 
project, when the F.I.R.S,T. office supplied official 
competition rules and two 70-pound crates of gears 
and gadgets for each participating team. Six weeks 
are then allowed to design, build and test their' 
remote-controlled robot. Students involved in the 
project will also work with outside professional engi-
neers to see how an engineer project is completed 
from start to fin ish.

Whale Day International is a 
weeklong global campaign from 
Feb. 12 through Feb. 18 designed 
to promote an 'end to whaling and 
other threats to whales, dol phins 
and other marine life. Other Whale 
Day events are occurring this week 
in cities such as Maui and 
Ensenada. 

The primary speaker was Jiah 
Whaleheart Miesel, the founder 
and director of Whale Day 
International. Responsible for 
organizing whale-related conserva-

soon be the recipient of the Bob 
Marley Peace Award, which will be 
presented to him in front of 18,000 
people at the San Diego SPOrts 
Arena. 

"I started [Whale Day] because 
of a time when I was in the Mating 
and Birthing Sanctuary at th~ San 
Ignacio Lagoon," Miesel said. "A 
mother and baby gray whale 
approached me, looked me in the. 
eye and let me touch them. My life 
was changed. I knew then that I 
would commit my life to protecting 
[whales and dolphins]."

Muir election 
tainted by 
unfair polling 

John Muir College recently passed a fee 
activity referendum that will increase stu-
dent fees to $7 per quarter. The new rev-
enues are intended to expand the college's 
programming, which is the source of 
activities sucfi as the Muir college suitcase 
dance, pizza study breaks during finals 
week and broom ball. 

Interestingly, however, the only polling 
place that Muir college cared to operate 
during the election was located in the 
Middle of Muir. The Guardian believes 
that, given the ability to set up online 
polling through StudentLink, this was an 
Inexcusable method of altering the voter 
pool so that the referendum would be 
more likeIy to pass. 

Most UCSD students are commuters, 
and as such, they visit their college cam-
puses less frequently than those who live 
In on-campus dormitories and apartments. 
In fact, unless one must complete some 
sort of academic counseling or unless one 
has a class in the immediate area, it is 
unlikely that a person will even set foot on 
his college's campus during an average 
day. 

Given that most Muir srudents are 
commuters and they typically visit their 
college campuses infrequently, it is alarm-
ing that Muir college failed to allow its 
students to vote via StudentLink. 
Providing this option would have made it 
as easy for commuters to have a sayan the 
fee hike as it was for those living on cam-
pus, since the commuters can't be offered 
the luxury of having a polling place out-
side their front door. 

Muir college's decision regarding the 
polling place becomes even more suspi-
cious, however, when one considers that 
commuters stand to gain little from fee 
referendums that throw more of their 
money at college programming, and are 
therefore less likely to vote in favor of 
such fee increases. Making it less likely 
that commuters would vote at all - and 
making it harder for them to do so in gen-
eral- was a perfect way of largely avoid-
ing their "no' votes. 

Another interesting aspect of Muir 
college'S referendum comes from Eleanor 
Rooseve lt College. One week before 
Muir college voted on its fee increase, 
Roosevelt college's similar activity fee 
referendum failed to pass, and Roosevelt 
students had voted electronically through 
StudentLink. 

Regardles of how much Muir college 
programming may need that extra $5 per 
tudent each quarter, the circumstances 

surrounding the fee referendum election 
are questionable. 

The Gum-dian hopes that Thurgood 
Marshall College's fee referendum, to be 
voted on Feb. 25 through Feb. 28, will be 
treated less questionably, and that when 
pollin g locations are decided, com-
muter " need will be considered equa lly 
with those of on-campus residents.

Enron: the . epitome of corruption, 
politics and greed 

Fall of energy company highlights problems with corpo-
rations' access to political players In Washington, D .C. 

By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

The news headlines are saturated 'by 
one word these days: Enron. Stocks and 
Enron, the presidential administration 
and Enron, California's energy crisis and 
Enron. Sheesh. 

I found myself asking, "Just who is 
this Enron guy and why does he have 
everyone's panties in a bunch?" I don't 
think I was alone when I asked this ques-
tion, demonstrating my ignorance 
toward a situation that seemed about as 
far removed from me as they come. 

But then I started to read the firs t few 
sentences of the articles following these 
headlines, 1 found myself raking through 
entire articles concerning Enron, and 
now I find myselflooking for Enron arti-
cles to dissect - even when they aren't 
on the front page. 

Why the sudden interest, you ask? 
Well, I didn't come to the realization 
that I had millions invested in Enron 
Corp. Likewise, I have not been subpoe-
naed to testify about my involvement in 
the Enron scandal. 

I realized that even though, like many 
of my counterparts, I am a lowLy college 
student with hardly enough money to 
put that extra slice of cheese on my 
grilled cheese sa ndwiches, the Enron 
debacle is extremely relevant to me. 

In fact, the disintegration of Enron 
and the corporation's political involve-
ment should pinch a nerve in all of us 
because at the end of the day, it isn't 
Kenneth Lay, the former CEO of 
Enron, and other millionaire tycoons 
who suffer, it is you and I who pay the 
heaviest price. 

First, the disintegration of Enron car-
ri es significant political implications. 
After it was noted that Enron was the 
single largest campaign contributor to 
the Bush administration - giving over 
$700,000 - many people began to won-
der if such a hefty amount could possibly 
affect Bush' pol icy decision . 

Wonder as we may, the Bush admin-
istration snubbed such inquiries and nat-
out refused to disclose documents con-
cerning meetings between Bush officials 

and Enron executives. 
Huh? If Dubya and gang have noth-

ing to hide, then what's aIL the hubbub? 
Congress requested information about 
meetings between the soLvent corpora-
tion's leading men and Vice President 
Dick Cheney. Cheney, with Bush 's over-
whelming support, thumbed his nose at 
each request. 

Cheney has long been mixed up in an 
energy task force that smelled a little 
foul, but in light of Enron, his involve-
ment with energy is downright fishy. 

Let's review: Enron is based in Texas 
and so is Bush. Enron is an energy com-
pany; Bush has the power to draft legis-

In fact, the disintegration 
of Enron and the 

corporation's political 
involvement should pinch 

a nerve in all of us 
because at the end of the 

day, it isn't Kenneth Lay. 
the former CEO of Enron, 

and other millionaire 
tycoons who suffer. it is 

you and I who pay the 
heaviest price. 

lation to make life easier for energy com-
panies, especially if they are big contrib-
utors from his home state. Hmmm -
interesting. The Bush administration 
claims no wrongdoing in its dealings 
with Enron, but refuses to disdose infor-
mation proving said innocence. 

In addition, the Enron debacle carries 
special implications for California resi-
dents. Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote in 
the Los Allge/rs Ti7lm that she made 
repeated reque ts to rrange meetings 
\vith Bush and Cheney, and she was 
denied each time. 

Last year, alifornia su ffered a lew 
of Stage 3 energy emergencies and 
Fcinstein wrote that he wanted to meet 

with top energy officials to discuss the 
state's energy woes. Conversely, while 
Feinstein was denied access to top offi-
cials, Lay, as CEO of Enron, got several 
meetings with Cheney and other admin-
istration officials. 

Feinstein wrote, "Something is 
wrong when a senator representing 35 
million Californians is not able to talk 
personally to the president or vice presi-
dent in the midst of a crisis, but execu-
tives from a company that contributed 
millions of campaign dollars have com-
plete access and significant influence. " 

I couldn't have said it better myself. 
I can't speak for the rest of America, 

but I would much rather have my presi-
dent getting a little fellatio on the side 
t11an giving billion-dollar corporations 
tax breaks or special consideration when 
no such allowances are made for me. 

Enron's descent also took a lot of 
ordinary folks down with it. The compa-
ny's bankruptcy turned many of its work-
ers' hard-earned savings into thin air. 
The employees were encouraged to 
invest their 401{k) retirement accounts 
into the company's stocks, even after 
indicators were showing the company 
was skating on thin ice. When the com-
pany co llapsed, the stocks obviously 
nosedived and the employees were left 
with 40 I (k) plans not worth the paper 
they were printed on. 

Doesn't sound very fail', does it? In 
fact, it isn't fail' that a handful of selfish, 
money-hungry executives can play 
Russian roulette with people 's savi ngs 
and their livelihood only to lose substan-
tially and subsequently cop out by plead-
ing the fifth. . . 

We may be college students now, but 
we are the future workers and investors 
of America, and there is a va luable lesson 
to be learned courtesy of Enron. 

We shou ld not blindly trust our 
employers, even when they assert every-
thing is on the up-and-up. We shouldn't 
over-invest in anyone company - even 
if it is the one we work for. AI 0, we 
should be mindful of our futures, 
bccau e our 401(k) plans and pensions

Edi tor: 

Thank you for your coverage 
of UCSD's involvement in the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Parade. 

You referred to some signs .:ar-
ried by a group of students; that 
group also carried a banner iden-
tifying us as representatives of the 
Campus Peace Coalition. 

In this letter we would like to 
correct a small error in your 
story, to provide some informa-
tion on our group and to relate a 
disturbing incident during the 
march. 

The sign you referred to read 
"Civil Rights are Human Rights" 
(emphasis added), not "is" as 
reported (we double-checked) . 

No hard feelings of course. 
The CPC, formed after Sept. 

II, is a registered student organi-
za tion representing a diverse 
array of campus groups and indi-
viduals. 

We are opposed to violence in 
all forms, including both the ter-
rorist acts and the illegal military 
response of the "war on terror-
isrn." 

We also oppose scapegoating 
and discrimination, especially 
that currently directed at 
Muslims and people of Middle 
Eas tern and Central Asian 
descent. 

Furthermore, we stand in 
defense of our civil rights, which 
are under attack under the guise 
of "strengthening national securi-
ty." 

We were proud to participate 
in this parade, since King hi mse! f 
passionately opposed war, vio-
lence and discrimination, and was 

a champion of civil rights. 
The CPC meets Wednesdays 

at 5 p.m. at the Women's Center 
and can be reached via e-mail at 
peace@/ibmad.ucsd.edu 

Now for the incident: Civil 
rights apparently are not perti-
nent to UCSD, while the San 
Diego Police Department is. 

Allow us to explain. 

Rotarllct 
SOlD 

The Thurgood Marshall 
group was marching right 
behind us, chanting things such 
as, "When I say 'UC,' you say 
'SO"" 

We briefly discussed the possi-
bility of adding our own chant of, 
"When I say 'civil rights' you say 
'human rights .... 

An unidentified UCSD staff 
person overheard this discussion. 

We were told that since this 
was the UCSD contingent of the 
parade, there would be no 
protesting, and that anything 
chanted had to be pertinent to 
UCSD. 

So, it would seeni that civil 
rights and human rights are rather 
controversial, since chanting 
those phrases would have 
amounted to "protesting. " 

Later, among the high -spi rit-
ed T hurgood Marshall chants 
was a call of "When I say 'SO,' 
you say "PO!'" as a nod to near-
by Sa n Diego police officers. 
The UCSD staff person did not 
react to this or other chants of 
questionable relevance to 
UCSD. 

The prohibition of our chant, 
coupled with acceptance of the 
police-related one, struck us as 
especially ironic, because King 
lived and died fighting for civil 
rights and human rights, often in 
the face of police intimidation. 

Decades later, we are suppos-
edly "living his dream," and yet a 
group of students trying to 
honor his memory was silenced 
by its own school because King's 
own message was too controver-

Valentine's Day is a tribute 
to consumerism, not love 
By JESSICA LlNCiEL 
Staff Writer 

1 hate Valentine's Day. It should 
be lumped together with all those 
other made-up holidays like St. 
Patrick's Day, Halloween and 
Winter Solstice, which are juSt 
more excuses to bolster the greet-
ing card industry. 

No, this is not the angry ram-
page of some bitter, single, self-
righteous hag who is merely jealous 
of the girls with admirers to show-
er them with flowers, balloons and 
chocolates. Not entirely, anyway. 

It 's just that I believe in doing 
something because you want to, 
not because there are big, shiny 
cardboard cupids plastered all over 
the place telling you that you 
should. 

Valentine's Day has been com-
mercialized so much that it is 
pointless, self-defeating and vague-
ly insulting. 

Love, affection, sentimentality 
these are things that should 

never be degraded into a matter of 
merchandise. 

These are the most treasured 
aspects of relationships and com-
panionship. When they are twisted 
and morphed into some commer-
cialized mating rirual, it doesn't 
sel'Ve as a declara tion of love, but 
rather as a tribute to the pathetic 
nature of our meaningless, con-
S1.Jl ner-driven lives. 

That people actually celebrate 
Valentines Day and take it serious-
ly just adds one more contribution 
to my ever-growing pile of prob-
lems with pop culrure. 

If you really ca re about someone 
to the point that you are willing to 
show your affection by purchasing 
something, then doing so solely in 
accordance with social custom 
defeats the purpose. 

When you grab a card and 
scribble a generically maudlin note 
for no reason other than that it's 
Feb.14, it eliminates any sincerity 
behind the gesrure, assuming there 
even was any. 

How pathetic that we have to 
designate a day to demonstrate 
affection. 

I would argue that instead of 
being a symbol of how much one 
cares, buying someone something 
just because it's Valentine 's Day is 
actually a mark of not really caring 
at all. Surprises and spontaneity 
mean much more than conforming 
to social custom. 

Maybe if it were less of a deal, it 
wouldn't be as vexi ng. Just on cam-
pus, Valentine's Day has taken over 
with a vengeance. We have our own 
version of "Singled Out" - yes, 
that oh-so-charming MTV mishap 
with the epitome of superficiality, 
Jenny McCarthy, playing co-host, 
later replaced by every gi rI 's role

basically 

L ast weekend, I was blessed by a visit from my younger sis-ter, Allie. Of course, by 
"blessed," I mean I was driven 
completely insane and will never 
fully recover. Same difference. 

What you need to understand 
about Allie is that she is very con-
cerned by how she looks. Mind 
you, she looks good - ask anyone 
with a penis. But she also cares how 
her mind looks, and this is where 
she runs into problems. 

Most of the time, my sister is so 
preoccupied with loolcing smart 
that she fails to take the time to 
actually bt smart. In other words, 
she's so busy arguing that she isn't 
stupid that she sometimes fails to 
realize that she is, at that very 
moment, acting stupid. 

Not that I don't love her. I do. 
But God help me, when she acts 
like that, I want to kick her ass. 

Friday night, after preparing a 
lovely bed fit for a queen (I put a 
pillow and blanket on our couch), I 
instructed Allie on protocol should 
she wake up before I did.

"Allie, pay the fuck attention!" 
Allie (not paying attention at 

all, I can tell): "I am!" 
Me (getting a grip on 

myseU): If you wake up in the 
morning and you get hungry, 
this is the only cereal I have. 

At this juncture, I hold up a 
bag of plain Cheerios that my 
mother had sent me, even 
though I don't eat cereal and I 
hlltt Cheerios. Whatever, it's the 
thought that counts. 

So I am holding a huge bag 
of cereal Vanna White-style, 
showing it off to the best of my 
ability, making it clear that 
Cheerios are all that is on the 
menu in the morning. 

But, Irnowing my sister as I 
do, I must stress this point still 
further. 

Me (stressing the point and 
still doing a damn good Vanna 
White impression): "Do you see 
that this is the only cereal you 
can eat?" 

Allie (getting vexed): "Yes, 
Carrie, I see the cereal. I get it." 

Me (still hammering the point 
home): "I am going to put it here 
on the counter, so you don't even 
have to look in the ~abinet for it." 

Allie (working up some seri-
ous sass): "Carrie, 1 am not an 
idiot. I gt t it. Gecz!" 

Me Oust messing with her at 
this point) : "So, what you 're say-
ing is, you don't Irnow where the 
cereal is?" 

Allie wasn't amused. 
Now, 1 must point out here 

that I was not just rtllCy eager to 
get rid of that cereal. My room-
mates own several varieties of 
cereal themselves, and they get ... 
lets just call it "possessive" of 
their food. Not that I blame 
them. I just don't want to get 
bitched out by a hungry woman 
because my sister can't tell a chee-
rio from a lucky chann. 

OK, so all is secure. The 
cereal is on the counter. It is 1111 
by itit/f. There is no way Allie 
can miss that bag. Unless she is 
struck from behind and conse-
quently blinded (which I totally 
would do, by the way), Allie's 
gonna mow where the Cheerios 
are. 

Fine. The next morning, I 
wake up and discover that Allie 
is still asleep, despite her 
protests that my walcing up at II 
a.m. is "way too late" for her. 

I go to the rice cooker and 
start malcing some rice for sushi. 
(Oh yeah, baby, 1 can make 
sushi. I am a freakin' glJUrmet.) 
Allie wakes up a few minutes 
later. 

We exchange half-hearted 
good mornings (she is groggy 
and I am annoyed that I have no 
cucumber). 

Then the moment of truth 
arrives. Allie gets up. She has 
that look in her eye that lets me 
know she is hungry. She moves 
to ... the Ulbi1ftt. 

I know it's coming. 11m07ll she 
is going to make an ass of her-
self. And do I stop her? 

Of course not. What kind of 
sister do you talee me for? 

Allie (pulling out the Corn 
Pops): "Can I have this?" 

Me (remaining calm): "Are 
you fucking lcidding me?" 

Allie (whipping out that Sklar 
sass again): "Carrie, I am siclc. of 
you treating me like an idiot. Can 
I have the Com Pops or not?" 

Well, I lost it. 
You can't blame me, really. I 

went out of my way to make su!e 
shc knew what cereal was mine, 
and it just popped out of tha t 
vacant little blonde head anyway. 

So I called her an. idiot (and 
she was - admit it) and gave her 
the cereal, and then I made 
myself some sushi. And then I 
gave her some, too, because that 
is the kind of philan thropic elder 
sibling that I am. 

So basically, yes, my sister can 
be dumb. And yes, J call her on.it. 
But the important lesson to Ie-JI 
here is really this: ever send me 
Cheerios. Just look at the trouble 
it causes!

Marshall Resident Dean 
Yolanda Trevino dismisses the Web 
site's claims. 

"There is a lot of misinforma-
tion ," Trevino said. "There is also a

The site also claims resident 
safety officers and Ma'rshall staff 
took unfair disciplinary actions 
against students. 

Trevino said that discipline is 
taken on a case-by-case basis and 
everyo ne is looked at individually. 
Among othe r things, this would 
mean that the disciplinarian would 
consider the severity of the offense 
and any prior offenses that a stu-
dent had when deciding on punish-
me nt. 

T he Vleb si te also states that "a 
TMC staff member has admitted 
that there have been more housing 
contracts terminated in the first 
two weeks of winter quarter 2002 
than all of the 2000-200 I school 
year." 

Trevino acknowledges that a 
high number of students have had 
their housing contracts terminated, 
but denies any conspiracy plot. 

"There have been a lot of hous-
ing contracts terminated this quar-

ter," Trevino said. "There just hap-
I>ened to be more violations. That 
is if." 

The si te also accuses th e college 
of not printing or posting the con-
sequences for breaking speci fic 
mles in enough places. However, 
Houston-Hands said the rules and 
regulations are printed in the TMC 
handbook, along with a list of pos-
sible sanctions for violations. 

Another complaint voiced on 
the Web si te is that students are 
being asked to vaca te their dorm 
rooms within two weeks of their 
housing contrac t bei ng terminat-
ed. . 

T he site claims that th is violates 
a Ca lifornia law that requires 
evictees to have 30 days to find 
another li vi ng situation. T he site 
cites specific clauses in California 
Civi l Code 1946 saying, " ... As to 
tenancies from month to month 
either of the p~rties may terminate 
the same by giving at least 30 days' 
written notice thereof." 

However, the code goes on to 
say that if the two parties reach an 
agreement at the time of the con-
tract, such as the UCSD housing 
contract, then the owner of the 
property - UCSD in this case -
can legally evict the ten ant with a 
minimum of seven days warning. 

The protest is scheduled for 
Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 
Marshall Field , according to the 
Web site.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2002 

Cruising in the limo: The date continues as both Kristen 
and Nate enter their limo, provided by Corporate Limo, as they 
head toward dinner at Forever Fondue. Could this be the 
beginning of a great date 7 

First encounter: Anxiety fills the air as Kristen and Nate 
meet for the first time and get a chance to know each other 
at the Guardian office.

necessarily be in the air, but 
the Guardian Blind Date was 
trying to at least spark some 
Aames. 

She was looking for a tall guy who 
makes her laugh. 

He was looking for someone with a 
sense of humor who is fun to be around. 

Kristen Santerre and Nate Jones 
were. the lucky winners of the Guardian 
Blind Date contest, and they were just 
looking to have some fu n. 

"I'm really excited, and I think it's 
going to be really fun," Santerre said 
before meeting Nate. "Me and my 
roommates always watch dating shows 
like 'Blind Date' and 'Fifth Wheel.' 
We're obsessed with them. And when I 
saw that there was a blind date, it just 
sounded like a lot of fun and I never 
thought 1 would win." 

On the other hand, Nate had some 
persuasion to sign up. "My volleyball 
buddies signed me up for it," Jones 
laughed. "I just gave them Illy informa-
tion and didn't expect much. I didn't 
think I had a chance." 

After the two met each other for the 
first time, they were swept off i nro the 
limousine idling downstairs and treated 
to the posh La Jolla restaurant, Forever 
Fondue, which was voted as the best date 
restaurant in the GUa1·dian readers poll. 

Hours later, they came back and the 
two seemed to be happy and in a pleas-
ant mood - a good indication that the 
blind date wasn't a disaster. 

"The date was great l And he was easy 
to talk to," Santerre said. 

Jones also seemed to have enjoyed 
himself. 

"The date was lots of fun. We went to 
a good place and we didn't run out of 
anything to talk about. One of the wor-
ries 1 had before was that we'd run out of 
things to talk about, but eventualfy we 
talked about sports, movies and whatev-
er we had in common," J ones said. 

Both agreed that besides the fantastic 
food, there wasn't anything exciting, 
though the date was laid-back. 

When asked if they would go on a 
second date, Jones replied, "She's lots of 
fun, for ure. And she's a cool gi rl. 1 don't 
know. We'll see."

Potions might be the alternative 
When tradition fails, try some herbs and oils 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Senior Staff Writer 

I n the memorable words of Ewan McGregor in "Moulin Rouge," "Love is a many splen-
did thing. Love lifts us up where we 
belong. All you need is love." 

For some people, love is just 
like magic, while for others, it 
takes a little magic to find love. If 
you're feeling like Cupid needs a 
helping hand this Valentines Day, 
a love spell may sound like a more 
attractive option than a blind date. 

However, if you decide to call 
. on the help of Venus, the goddess 
of love, rather then your match-
making friends, there are a few 
things to know before casting a 
love spell. 

Andrea Hall, who works at 
Starcrafts, a metaphysical book-
store in Ocean Beach, Calif., 
points out that the most important 
consideration in casting spells is 
not to focus on a specific person. 

"You shouldn't try to change 
the will of another person," she 
said. "If you specifically focus on 
an individual, you would be 
changing their will, and that 
wouldn't be fair." 

While it is tempting to bewitch 
the one your heart desires, Hall 
explains that you should focus on 
attracting the attributes of that per-
son. The purpose of a love spell is 
to attract love of any kind into your 
life and to make it easier for love to 
find you. However, according to 
Hall, "as a Wiccan, you don't 
change the will of another person." 

With that disclaimer, there are 
tons of herbs, flowers, oils and

La Jolla is a long way from New Orleans. Taking the former's culture over that of the latter 
would be difficult and probably 
pointless - they already have rich 
people and college students (La 
Jolla's two main cultural fixtures) in

of musi c, you must select the

Anyone can pick up some 
Ma rvin Gaye ("What's Going

("Cooleyhigh harmony") on the 
CD player to set the mood. A 
good AI Gree n or Barry White 
medley can ignite the fire for 
most. For the guitar-inclined, you 
can always mrn to some Chris

"Forever Blue"). And the classic 
love songs by Frank Sinatra or 
Dean Martin should always be at 
your fingertips.

Blue Six - 'Beautiful Tomorrow' 
(Astralwerks/Naked Music) 

Blue Six have released sexy 
tunes such as "Sweeter Love" and 
"Music and Wine," and they 
recently released a full-length 
album titled "Beautiful 
Tomorrow." The warm Blue Six 
sound embodies the San 
Francisco deep-house feel that is 
also characteristic of other Naked 
Music artists such as Miguel 
Migs. Deep bass grooves, subtle 
jazz influences, red-light district 
horns, airy vocals and the patter 
of bongos all melt together into 
one steamy album. You are sure to 
have a "Beautiful Tomorrow" 
after a run-through with this 
album.

is used for lust. Also try burning 
pink and red candles to create 
some love energy. 

If you still feel like you need an 
elaborate ritual , there are hun-
dreds of books on casting spells 
and attrac ting love. Hall recom-
mends "Wicca for the Solitary 
Practitioner" by Scott Cunigham 
for those new to the craft, as well 
as "\'Vitches Circle" by Maria Kay 
Simms.

the context of this album, but 
one fact still remains : "The 
Joshua Tree" is one of the best 
albums of all time. There is an 
epic quality to the music, with 
Bono's soaring vocals on tracks 
such as "With or Without You" 
and the incredible and distinctive 
jangle of the guitar work by The 
Edge. Don't mind the religious 
overtones and dive into the 
music of one of the best gui tar 
bands of all time. 

MJ Cole - 'Sincere' (Island) 
The same old R&B can be 

boring. MJ Cole might be the 
answer. MJ Cole and his U.K. 
garage sound have been intro-
duced stateside by Craig David. 
Hopefully MJ Cole will be able to 
continue this trend with the funky 
syncopation in his two-steppin' 
sound . 

Imagine drum 'n' bass slowed 
down. Sweet diva-vocals ("Crazy 
Love"), jazz influences ("Tired 
Games"), plaintive violins ("Crazy 
Love." "Strung Out") and coy 
basslines ("Attitude") make for an 
up-beat, champagne -smooth 
sound. 

If love spells are all you're 
after, "Wicca Love Spells" by 
Gerina Dunwich ranks high on 
Hall's reading list. Or you can 
stop by Starcrafts 3t. 1909 Cable 
St. and talk to Hall yourself. 

She'd be happy to mix up a 
potion to send Cupid's arrow fly-
ing your way.

How to find romance in 
all the right movies 
A longing look at the best classics and 
modern films to share with the one you love 
By CHARLIE fRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Cinema has a long tradition of evoking powerful emotions and feelings that not only hit 
the eyes, but also aim for the heart. 
The right romantic film could turn 
any ordinary night into an unfor-
gettable event. Here are some of 
the greatest modern and classic 
films to see .. 

'casablanca' (1942) 
One of the greatest and most 

romantic classics around 
"Casablanca" still shines 60 year~ 
after its release. Humphrey Bogan 
plays suave yet troubled Ric:C 
Blane, the owner of a Moroccan 
nightclub in the midst of Nazi 
occupation and the French resis-
tance. Ingrid Bergman stars as a 
woman who must decide between 
the tough, gritty Blane and the 
heroic Victor Laszlo, played by 
Paul Henreid. With more catchy 
and memorable quotes than any 
other film, "Casablanca" remains 
untouched in romantic endurance. 

'Dirty Dancing' (1987) 
Jennifer Grey and Patrick 

Swayze team up to star in this 
sleeper hit about a woman who falls 
in love with her dance instructor. 
Although some consider it cheesy, 
"Dirty Dancing" combines a classic 
storyline with a great soundtrack. 

'My Fair Lady' (1964) , 
Now a rare genre, musicals used 

to reach the hearts of audiences 
everywhere. One of the best musi-
cals produced also happens to be 
one of the most touching. It's a 
"I overly" Audrey Hepburn vehicle 
in which she plays flower-girl Eliza 
Doolittle, who is rransformed into a 
lady by the soul-less Dr. Henry 
Higgins. Compared to taday's soci-
ety, "My Fair Lady" appears old-
fashioned and sexist, but itS beautiful 
music still touches the hean. Also 
look for the wonderful, grandiose 
costumes of Cecil Beaton. 

'Shakespeare in Love' (1998) 
This witty portrayal of William 

Shakespeare Ooseph Fiennes) can 
not only be translated into modern 
society, but it also has a touching 
plot about how a woman named 
Violet (Gwyneth Paltrow) manages 
to cure Shakespeare's writing block 
and capture his heart. In this film, 
"Romeo and Juliet" was inspired by 
the romantic affair between 
Shakespeare and Violet. 

When Harry met Sally' (1989) 
This modern classic tries to 

answer one of the biggest love 
questions around : Can two friends 
sleep together and still be friends 
the next morning? The film follows 
Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two 
friends who meet in college and 
their ensuing love lives as the years 
pass. One of the most memorable 
scenes in modern cinema is Ryan 
faking an orgasm in a diner while 
Crystal looks on, confusingly 
amazed.

Baroque opera makes stunning 
debut at the Civic Theatre 
Handel's 'Ariodante' combines great 
performances with lavish costumes 
By SABRINA MORRIS 
Staff Writer 

" Ariodante," the obscure opera 
by Hand el that has always 
peered out from the shadow 

of the venerated "The Messiah," 
now find s its place in the sun with 
the San Di ego Opera . 

' '''i th the ebb of baroque-style 
operas these days, Handel seems to 
be creeping hack on the scene, and 
wi th his work fo llows a surprisingly 
cnrhusiastic pa tronage. 

Th is season's performance 
proves to be excellent wi th an 
emphatic orchestra with talented 
director John Copely, conductor 
Kenn eth Montgomery and an 
astoundin g voice cast. 

Ariodante, once a castrato role 
(a part played by a castrated male 
singer), is now a "trouse r role" 
pl ayed by a woma n, and makes its 
appearance wi th mezzo-soprano 

Vivic:! Genaux. 
Genaux steals the show with her 

impressive octave range, breath 
control and quick changes in voice . 

T hough slumped in the wake of 
Gcnaux's per formance, the rare 
countertenor David Walker makes 
his debut playing the villainous 
Polinesso. 

In the background of these tal-
ented singers is a di stracting and 
puzzling surrealist/post-modernist 
set design. The brilliant and vivid 
18th century-style costumes that 
adorn each singer do not mesh well 
with this experimental set design . 
Traditio nalism and surrealism

'Ariodante' is played beautifully by the ca~t of San Diego Opera.

14 fliAT 'S THE UC D GUARDIAN THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 14. 2002 

Examining gender perspectives on 'The Vagina Monologues' 
He says: 'Even the most hard of hearts would have to 

agree that if nothing else, it certainly is exciting' 
She says: 'To be honest, watching 'The Vagina 
Monologues' was an enlightening experience' 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Though a somewhat ioaccurate name 
since there are several group performances. 
this boldly vaginal theater is a complicated 
and powerful performance. The most diffi-
cult pan is the diversity of emotions that is 
brought forth in the vignettes. Rangi ng 
from irreverent to depressing and often very 
sexual. "The Vagina Monologues" is enter-
taining and eye-opening. ( liked it all . but 
even the most hard of hearts would have to 
agree that if nothing else. it certainly is 
exciting. 

This play has become known for how 
striking it is wi th its open se~u a l i ty and 
genitally intimate topics. and the cast is 
definitely will ing to risk shocking you a 
few rimes with unexpected words and 
actions. 

There is a delicate ba lance between 
delightful and provocative, and I would sus-
pect that the most resolute misogynist could 
still find something interesting about a 
woman asking the crowd to say "cunt" (she 
does so to reclaim the word). 

Humor and surprise were brought out 
equally and with rather easy transi ti 9ns, 
but the mood also changed to a more seri -
ous tone. Dealing with the issues of female 
genita l muti lation and the raping of women 
during the war in Bosnia, serious issues 
were honestly and openly confronted. 

The accounts of several girls' fi rst peri -
ods and their families' reactions ran the 
ga mut, painting a compelling image of what 
it is like to have an unexpected surge of 
blood Start leaking our of your childhood 
unmentionables. 

Preventing any sleeping audience mem-
bers, the rendition of a verity of orgasms 
grabs your attention, playfully. 

"The Vagina Monologues" gives a full-
force production from start to finish that 
really anyone would be able to enjoy. 
Daring and perhaps a little ,brazen, the 
UCSD cast makes an entertaining and live-
ly performance. Considering the range of 
atti tudes of men, let me just say this: The 
da nce between sexual and erotic will likely 
keep some longer than if the performance 
were less up-front about sexuality and, well 
.. . moaning. 

By RUBY CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

Having watched "The Vagina 
Monologues" for the first time, my initial 
reaction was that of shock and bewilder-
ment, because never have I heard the words 
"vagina," "pussy," "clitoris" and "cunt" said 
so many times - especially by women. 

After getting over the initial shock, I found 
myself deeply enjoying the show because as a 
female,] can easily relate to many of the issues 
discussed . Scenes dealing with humorous and 
easily relatable issues were immensely enjoy-
able, and I laughed along with the cast. 
However, scenes dealing with serious issues 
produced quite the opposite effect on me. 
Stories of female genital mutilation disgusted 
me and brought me close to tears because I 
learned that a process equal to male castration 
is still being performed on young girls in cer-
tain parts of the world. 

Disturbing as it is, bringing such atrocities 
to my anention made me extremely angry and 
very eager to find out how I can contribute to 
hel p save these banered women. If anyth.ing, 
"The Vagina Monologues" reminded me that 

the merciless abuse of women still exists, and 
that women around the globe need to urute to 
fight these sadistic forces that continue to 
oppress us. 

I understand that the main mission of 
"The Vagina Monologues" is to stop vio-
lence against women around the world and 
to teach women to love themselve more. 
However, certain scenes confused me 
because they seemed to deviate from that 
objective. Perhaps it's the way I have been 
raised and 'socialized that contributed to that 
confusion. T hen again, my reaction was nor-
mal, considering it was my first time being so 
openly exposed to sensitive and serious sub-
jects such as homosexuality and free sex. 

To be honest, watching "The Vagina 
Monologues" was an enlightening experience 
for me because not only did I love myself 
more as a woman aftel'Ward, it was comfort-
ing to discover that many women out there 
have the same anxieties and questions I have, 
and also have gone through similar experi-
ences. Most importantly, I enjoyed the show 
because it made me more sociall y aware of 
the obstacles women still have to overcome 
to live a life free of male oppression.

Shepard: 
Very little information given 
about the play's plot 
Continued from pap 9 
dues about their backgrounds and 
relationships with each other. 

With plots not being the point 
of the plays, it seems as though 
there should have been heavy the-
matic content. However, once 
again, these plays fail ~o deliver. 
While there are any number of 
themes that you could drag out of 
these plays if you wanted to spend 
hours analyzing them, there are no 
definite themes apparent. Rather, 
the apocalyptic ideas running 
through the dramas just leave the 
viewer feeling disturbed. 

Even more upsetting than the 
apparent lack of purpose to the 
plays is the lack of information to 
be found about them. The program 
lacks any real insight into the pro-
ductions, and even the UCSD Web 
si te devoted to them reveals only 
rough] y a sentence's worth of infor-
mation. 

The bright spot to these plays 
were the sets and the lighting, 
which were designed by Patrick 
Larsen and M. Scott Garbau . 
"Icarus' Mother" uses a screen as a 
background to first show the blue 
sky and fireworks of the Fourth of 
July, and then the final apocalyptic 
blast. "Action" was set against a 
backdrop of metal bars with only a 
table, chairs and a Christmas tree 
for scenery. The lighting was dim 
and the larger-than-life shadows 
created on the wall were great for 
setting the somber mood of the 
play. 

Overall, the plays are 
mediocre. If you enjoy in-depth 
analysis of post-modern theater, 
this is a great production. Other 
than that, this play is not one of 
the better theater experiences at 
UCSD. 

Cajun: 
Music also incorporates 
lyrics in Acadien French 
Continued from .,. 9 

will bring their bon umps to 
Mandeville Auditorium on Feb. 
15, 

Cajun and Zydeco music is 
somewhere in the neighborhood 
of jazz, bluegrass, swing and 
Celtic folk songs. It resulted from 
the unique blending of popula-
tions that occurs in Louisiana: 
Acadiens (Cajuns), who came to 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

the South from Ireland via 
French Canada, cosmopolitan 
Yankees and descendants of blade 
slaves. 

The sound is pure bayou bliss. 
Nimble-fingered fiddlers and 
accordion masters embroider 
unique ballads and dance tunes 
over catchy beats. The lyrics are 
often in Acadien French and 
therefore difficult to understand, 
but their quirky themes of love 
are appealing and, if nothing else, 
it sure sounds nice. 

Beau Solei I have been malcing 
great music for 25 years and are 
nationally known for their 

appealing Cajun recordings, 
most prominendy showcased on 
their 1997 album "L'Amour au la 
Folie" ("Love or Folly"). The 
group is high-energy and sincere 
at the same time, and promises 
to keep its audience's toes tap-
ping in their seats - if they can 
resist the urge to dance in the 
aisles. 

Beau Soleil perform with fid-
dle master Michael Doucet on 
Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Mandeville 
Auditorium. Ticlc.ets are S20 gen-
eral admission, S18 for UCSD 
faculty, staff and for seniors, and

after living in the dorms, He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls

Golf grabs first at tourney 
Tritons beat M aster's College by three strokes 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

UCSD golf began its 2002 season at the 
Point Loma Invitational last Monday and 
Tuesday at Riverwalk Golf Course. In the 
team's first tournament since early 
November, the Tritons nabbed first place, 
finishing three strokes ahead of Master's 
College. 

The difference for UCSD came in the 
second round of the tournament, as they shot 
294 as a team. Master's College's shot 297. [n 
the first and third rounds, both teams fin-
ished with identical 311 and 301 team scores. 

California State University San 
Bernardino and Point Loma Nazarene 
rounded out the top four fi nishers, wi th the 
Coyotes ending the tournament six strokes 
behind the Tritons, and the Crusaders finish-
ing seven strokes behind UCSD. 

California State University Monterey Bay 
and Claremont McKenna both finished with 
overall scores of 914 to tie for fifth place. 

Sophomores Brian Duckworth and Galen 
Farris led UCSD - both finished in a five-
way tie for 5th place with a three-round score 
of 224 along with Holy Names' Matt 
Thornton, Monterey Bay's Chris Marin, and 

UC Santa Barbara'sJ .R. Reyes. 
Tritons Alan Scheer and Greg Wilson 

continued the sophomore sweep of top fin -
ishers for UCSD, ending the tournament 
with overall scores of 228 to end in a three-
way tie for 15th place. Sheer banJid his way 
back after hitting an 81 in the first round by 
posting second- and third-round scores of 7 3 
and 74, respectively. . 

Sophomore Blake Sneider and juniors 
Andy Thomson and Ryan Gale rounded out 
the scoring for the Tritons, finishing 25th. 
26th and 29th respectively. 

In the par-72 course, Point Loma 's Josh 
Colace was the only competitor to finish 
under par after three rounds, firing a 69, 72, 
and 72 to end three under par. The closest 
finishers after Col ace were Master's College'S 
Ryan Higton and Redlands College's Jordan 
Bailey, who both finished at six over par with 
final scores of 222. 

Marin had the low round of the tourna-
ment, shooting a 68 in the first round to join 
Col ace as the only two competitors to shoot 
under 70. 

The Tritons will travel to San Leandro, 
Calif., to participate in the Holy ames 
College Tournament from Feb.I S to Feb. 19 
at the Monarch Bay Golf Course.

less innings until Eagles 
right fielder Joanna Gray hit 
a two-run homer in the bot-
tom of the 3rd to give Biola a 
2-0 lead. 

The Eagle lead held up 
until the bottom of the 7th 
inning when fate found its 

way into the Triton dugout. 
With two outs, Mieko 
McCue and Mettee each gOt 
on base to give Anderson a 
chance to be the hero. 
Anderson hit sharp 
ground ball to the Eagle 
shortstop that took a bad 
hop off the infield dirt, 
bounced off the shortstop's 
shoulder and rolled into left 
field . Two runs scored and 
the game was ti.ed at two. 
Moments later, Harlan 
added a two-run double to 
give the Tritons a 4-2 lead. 

Martinelli , who pitched 
a total of II innings on the 
day, commented afterward 
on the close games: "We 
feel real good about taking 
these games," she said . "We 
were in the ga mes the 
whole time but it was a 
question of whether or not 
we were going 10 beat our-
selves."

Men's tennis wins third-straight 
Alliant International University fails to win a single match 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The men's tennis team contin-
ued its domination by picking up its 
third straight victory with a sweep 
over Alii am [nternational 
University on Tuesday. 

The Tritons won every match 
taking an amazing 96 games to 
Alliam's 29 . 

UCSD's No. 1 doubles team of 
Sameer Chopra ;lOd Bryan Swatt 
started the Tritons off on the right

the blue team, and the Alumni fin-
ished a close third, just seven points 
shy of beating the favored Tritons . . 
For most of the ah.imru, however, 
just competing again for their alma 
mater was enough. 

"A lot of the people on the team 
are sti ll friends so it was fun to see 
them and compete against them," 
said alumnus Stev!m Sorensten. 
"Experiences in Triton track gave 
me a lot of friends and taught me 
how to interact and how to not 
interaCT with people in authority." 

Sorensten went on to comment 
about how difficult it was to get 
back on the track in full form; that 
most of the alumni felt the difficul-
ty of competing d)le to their age 
and lack of consistent training . 

Few freshman have been added 
to the squad this yea r, and perform-
ers such as Ryan Vincent, Jeff 
Conkey and numerous others will 
determine how far UCSD will go 
this season. 

"We are definitely a better team 
than last year on both the men's 
and women's sides because most of 
the freshman now on the roster are 
much higher caliber athletes than 
in the past," Sa lerno said. "Most of 
the freshman will be 'im pact' ath-
I etes for us." 

As the Tritons look forward to a 
long and rewarding season, coach 
Salerno was quick to note that the 
team is experiencing no major 
injuries heading into the major 
meets. He expects "to have every-
body healthy when it counts for 
conference championships." 

foot with an 8-3 victory over their 
opponents. The No. 2 and 3 
Triton teams, Everett Schroeter-
Jeff Wilson and Dan Albrecht-
Sean Nagel, also picked up easy 8-
o and 8-2 victories for UCSD to 
give the Tritons the doubles 
sweep. 

The Tritons continued to domi -
nate in singles play, as No.1 fresh-
man Blake Wilson-Hayden earned 
the straight set victory 6-3, 6-4. ' 
UCSD's Emil Novak played the 
closest match of the day, going to 

Another tuneup meet lies ahead 
for the UCSD teams as they travel 
to Pomona-Pitzer to face strong 
competition from Division II 
opponents. 

"I suspect we will send about 75 
percent of our squad to Pomona-
Pitzer," Salerno said. "We will likely 
rest many of our higher caliber peo-
ple and give some of the new people 
a chance to compete. The meet at 
Pomona-Pitzer will be a non-scoring 
meet \vith all ranges of competition." 

The team acknowledges that its 
first real test will be Feb. 23 at Cal 
State Los Angeles when it faces all 

10 games in each set before taking 
the 6-4, 6-4 win. 

Arnir Nejad, Doug Hofmann, 
Nick Morton and Sean 
Higginbotham each earned singles 
victories against their Alliant oppo-
nents. with Morton going undefeat-
ed with a perfect 6-0, 6-0 victory. 

With this victory, the Triton's 
remain undefeated in the season 
and carry a 3-0 record heading 
into the Cal Poly Team 
Tournament Feb . 15 through Feb. 
17 in Pomona, Calif. 

the Southern California schools 
from the CCAA. 

"Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
the women's si de and Cal Poly 
Pomona on the men's side could 
challenge us," Salerno said. "We 
know we are better than last year 
but we really don 't know what they 
have." 

With bright, upcoming athletes 
ready to shine, as well as veterans 
performing at their peak, the Triton 
men 's and women's track and field 
teams look to eclipse their achieve-
ments from last year. But as Vargas 
remarked, it is "too early to decide."

alumni. 

Over 40 alumni competed 
against the 2002 Triton track team, 
and with a new format, the Triton 
alumni were surprisingly close to 
upsetting the current squad. 

The format had the men's and 
women's teams mixed then split 
into equal teams designated as blue 
and gold to compete against each 
other and the alumni . With a little 
help from past and present Triton 
coaching staff members competing 

for the alumni team, the alums 
were just seven points away from 
defeating the blue squad. 

"This was a great way to begin 
the season," said freshma n Angelo 
Vargas. "The alumni performed 
well. We can use this performance 
as a team to get better and see 
where we are in the big picrure." ~ 

In the javelin, Lynne Brinkman 
scored an all -time record by post-
ing a 132'-8" throw, the longest in 
school history. In the men's 100-
meter dash Wale Olagunju beal 
captain Sam Denes by .06 seconds 
to take the race, proving that the 
alumni could compete with the 
younger Tritons. 

Another highlight included 
Meredith Perry's performance in 
the I DO-meter hurdles as she post-
ed a time of 15.20 seconds, rank-
ing her second in the all-time per-
formances in Triton history. 

Senior Megan Bergin recorded 
a hammer throw of 158' II ", rank-
ing her second all-time in Triton 
history. 

On the men 's side, the top per-
former was that of sophomore 
Marcus Keller, whose 45'-10" triple 
jump put him fifth all-time among 
UCSD track and field athletes. 

"Perhaps the biggest benefit of 
the meet is the chance for our cur-
rent athletes to meet some of the 
alumni, " said head coach Tony 
Salerno. "We had over 40 alum 
show up to compete and help offi-
ciate. I think it is really inspiring 
for our current athletes to put a 
face to name for the record book."

UCSD squared off against 
nonconference rival Point Loma 

azarene University on Tuesday 
afternoon at Triton Baseball 
Field. 

In their previous battle with the 
Crusaders just one week ago, the 
Tritons took a 3-1 decision after 
two UCS D players blasted solo 
home runs. However, this was not 
the case on Tuesday when Point 
Loma overpowered UCSD and 
won by a final score of 13-2 . 

Sophomore Raf Bergstrom was 
on the hill for the Tritons and 
pitched just three innings . 
Bergstrom began to struggle in the 
top of the first when two batter 
flied out and Crusader Matt 
Mamula singled to right center 
field . Matt Thorne then blasted a 
home run to left field , igniting 
Point Loma 's offense. 

UCS D regrouped, and in the 
bottom of the first, just after 
Triton left fielder John Bologna 
grounded out to the shortstop, 
center fielder Matt Smith singled 
down the left field line. With a 
runner on first and two outs, 
sophomore cat~her Jeff Riddle 
knocked a triple into center field, 
scoring Matt Smith on the play. 

UCSD third baseman Ryan 
Larson was hit by a pitch from 
Point Loma starter Derek Davis, 
and then with runners at the cor-
ners, freshman designated hitter 
Garret Riddle smacked a single up 
the middle to score Jeff Riddle 
and tie the game at two runs 
apiece_ 

Though Matt Smith went 3 for 
3, Jeff Riddle hit 2 for 4, Garret 
Riddle went 2 for 3 and Larson 
went 2 for 3 on the day. The two 
runs in the first were the end of 
the scoring drive for UCSD. 

On the visiting side, Point 
Loma azarene scored in every 
inning but the sixth in its victory 
over UCSD. 

The Tritons used six pitchers in 
the loss, including Bergstrom, 
Tommy Sereno, Keith Smith, 
Robert Bush, Robert Peele and 
Dan Krefft. With 10 hits and 
seven runs recorded in 
Bergstrom's three innings, he 
picked up the loss and is now I-I 
on the year. 

UCSD drops to 6-5-1 overall 
and remains 2-2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, 
while Point Lorna improves to 6-
2-1 overall and has yet to begin 
league play. 

"What's done is done," said 
Triton catcher Jeff Riddle after the 

loss. "We've got 56 games in a sea-
son and some days things won't go 
our way. We'll continue to work 
hard and push ourselves, 
approaching [other teams] the 
sa me way we approach every 
game." 

The Tritons face off against Cal 
State Dominguez Hi lls in a four-
game set this weekend. The first 
two will be played at Triton 
Baseball Field Feb. 14 and Feb. IS, 
followed by a doubleheader on 
Feb. 16 in Carson.
