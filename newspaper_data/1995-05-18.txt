Berkel.y to Hav. 
Own Toxic Dump 
BERKELEY -UC Berkeley is 
one step closer to having its 
own toxic storage facility after 
more than 30 Berkeley 
residents and students last 
week voiced their approval of 
the university'S latest plans to 
place the facility in Callaghan 
Hall. The location of the 
facility became a source of 
controversey last year. The 
new site was praised for its 
proximity to the sources of 
waste, availability of police 
and fire services, reduced 
seismic concerns, a lack of 
groundwater and an existing 
water and electricity infra-
structure.

SAN FRANCISCO - UCSF 
researchers have conducted an 
analysis which pinpoints 
global economic policies as a 
culprit in the spread of AIDS 
throughout developing 
countries. The study found 
that the economic policies of 
the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) have led to increased 
migration and urbanization in 
borrowing nations, two factors 
which have helped to spread 
HIV. Researchers said that the 
population shift from rural to 
urban dwellings will put many 
more people at risk of 
contracting the virus. They 
proposed that" AIDS Impact 
Reports" be conducted in the 
future before future World 
Bank and IMF loans are 
granted.

Sun God Fest Price Tag Tops $47,000 
CONCERT: Festival 
expands to a two-day 
event with PUFF 
By MarllNl ... Villi 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD's 13th annual Sun God 
Festival kicks off tomorrow, having 
expanded in both size and cost. The 
$47,000 event, featuring daytime 
festivals and evening concerts on 
Friday and Saturday, cost the A.S. 
over $15,000 more than last year. 

This year's concert has been 

moved to the Warren Mall, costing 
the A.S. more than $9,000 for addi-
tional lighting, fencing and secu-
rity. The move was required be-
cause Library Walk construction 
blocked emergency exits and re-
duced the Price Center's capacity. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk said 
she would like to see the administra-
tion pay for some, if not all, of the 
cost of moving the concert, though 
the A.S. has not made any specific 
request to the university. 

According to Sun God Festival 
Chair Allen Louison, Warren Mall 

99 BOTI't JES ••• 

was chosen because it provides ad-
equate emergency exits, has a ca-
pacity of up to 6,000 people and 
does not impact nearby neighbor-
hoods. 

Because a concert has never been 
held at this location, Louison said 
he could not say what the acoustics 
of the area W(luld be. However, he 
added that the buildings would prob-
ably cause some distortion of sound. 

The Pharcyde, a hip-hop/rap 
group which played at Lollapalooza 
last year, will headline this year's

Greek Columns 
Survive Internal 
A.S. Challenge 
VOTE: A.S. will continue to 
fund Guardian advertising 
space for fraternities, sororities 
By NI ... 8ouChton 
Staff Writer 

A proposal to cut Associated Students fund-
ing for the Greek Columns, a semi-weekJy ad-
vertising supplement to the GUlJrdian, was de-
feated in a non-binding straw-poll last night by 
a vote of 15-5, with 3 abstentions. 

Citing a violation of the A.S. Media Charter, 
A.S. CommissionerofCommunications Farsam 
Shadab recommended that Greek Columns no 
longer receive funding in its current form. 

According to Shadab, the Media Charter 
states that alternative media funding can only be 
spent on printing and production costs. The 
Greek Columns, which uses its funding to pur-
chase advertising space in the Guardian, vio-
lates this rule, he said. 

"When you buy space in the Guardian, you're 
paying for more than just the physical paper and 
ink," said Shadab. "You're buying the space in 
there because they guarantee an audience. What 
we're doing for Greek Columns is buying their 
audience and that's the difference. Other alter-
native media have to create their own reader-
ship."

Student Art Stolen From Price Center's Ballroom Lounge 
CRIME: Paintings by 
UCIA artist were 
taken in late April 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 

Two paintings by student Jane 
Granby were stolen from the Price 
Center Ballroom Lounge sometime 
between April 29 and May 1. 

The pieces, titled "Together" and 
"The Girl," were part of Granby's 
"The Dance ofUfe" collection. The 
paintings were hung Saturday, April 
29 and Granby noticed them miss-

ing on Tuesday, May 2. 
"I came to school and they were 

gone," said Granby, a UCLA stu-
dent attending UCSD through the 
Inter-Campus Visitor Program. "I 
just about fell over." 

"We've had art taken before like 
this," said Jim Carruthers, director 
of University Centers. "Sometimes 
it's been prankish, or someone just 
says, 'I'd like that in my res hall,' 
but then it comes back. We hope 
that is the cue this time." 

"I can't imagine walking in a 
room and going, 'I like that,' or 'I 
could use the frame,' and just walk-

ing off with it," Granby said. 
"Together," the smaller of the 

two pieces, is about 8-1/2x 11 inches. 
Granby said it has been compared to 
a stained glass window because of 
its bright watercolor pencil and clear, 
edgeless glass frame. 

"["Together"] is special to me," 
she said. "It was my first recognized 
piece, the first to ever be shown. " 

"The Girl," the second piece sto-
len, is approximately 18 x 24 inches. 
Granby described it as light pink 
and white housepaint and oilstick 
on tom drawing paper. 

Carruthers said he would appre-

ciate any information about the m iss-
ing art, "no questions asked." 

Granby's work has been shown 
at the San Diego Museum of Art, as 
well as at several Los Angeles gal-
leries and is currently on display at 
Westwood's T. Heritage Gallery. 

Granby's interest in painting, 
film, and mixed media led her to 
study at the Zamorano Fine Arts 
Academy and the San Diego School 
of Creative and Performing Arts. 
She has also studied under the di-
rection of UCLA Professor Henry 
Hopkins and such artists as James 
Haywood and Don Suggs.

Giant Insects Unked 
To High Oxygen Level 

ETCETERA. • • 
RESEARCH: Higher oxygen concentration may 
have caused gigantism and facilitated evolution 

CALVIN a HOBBES by Bill Watterson 

ByM ........ "...1 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD researchers announced 
earlier this month that an increase in 
atmospheric oxygen several hun-
dred million years ago may have 
been responsible for the growth of 
enormous insects. The reason for 
the existence of such 
insects, including 
dragonflies with I 
two-and-a-half-foot 
wingspan, had not 
been widely re-
searched in the past. 

were covered by sediment. Because 
the plants never decomposed, the 
carbon which was locked in their 
tissues was never re-released into 
the atmosphere. So, planlll contin-
ued to release oxygen while carbon 
was locked in the earth. 

According to Graham, the con-
sequences oftbis in-
creased level ofoxy-
gen affected all life 
on earth. 

Remains of in-
sects, such as drag-
onflies, spiders and 
scorpions from this 
period are far larger 
thin any insects ex-
isting today. 

Dr. Jeff Graham, 
director of the 
Scripps Center for . 
Marine Biotechnol-
ogy and 
Diomedecine, and 
his colleagues have 
theorized that a 
jump in the concen-
tration of oxygen in 
the earth's atmo-
sphere during the 
late Paleozoic era 
also facilitated the 
evolution of land

Insects have a 
ci rculatory system 
which Graham de-
scribed as a root -like 
network of tubes 
which start at the 
surface of their bod-
ies and penetrate to 
all of their cells. 
This process of res-
piration relies on the 
diffusion of oxygen 
Ind is not feasible 
unless the cells of 
the insect are rela-

;lively near the sur-
face of its body. 

Graham theo-
rized that the in-
crease in oxygen al-
lowed these diffu-
sion-dependent in-
sects to grow to 
enormous sizes and 
develop the ability 
to fly. "In order for 
insects to support 
flight, which re-
quiresa tremendous 
amount of energy, 
they probably 
would have had to

Though much of 
the scientific com-
munity had accepted

sidering what the 
implications of this 
was on plants and 
animals."

was more oxygen 
present," Graham 
said. 

Graham speculates that the inva-
sion of plants onto land caused the 
change in oxygen level. "This was a 
very tumultuous time, when a lot of 
plants and animals were just begin-
ning to live on land," Graham said. 

Through the process of photo-
• synthesis, plants emit oxygen after 

taking in carbon dioxide Ind fixing 
it into their tissue. Because life on 
land was relatively new, decompos-
ing organisms, such as insects and 
bacteria, did not yet exist. There-
fore, when plants died, they were 
not broken down and over time they 

Graham and his 
colleagues also theorized that an 
increase in oxygen may have al-
lowed the first terrestrial vertebrates 
to move onto land. "To go from 
waterto land is a tremendous change 
because suddenly an animal has to 
bearits own weight, "he said. "When 
you think about the oxygen require-
ments of an animal that goes from 
basically floating or sitting still to 
one that is walking on land, [they] 
represents incredible increase. We 
think that the enhanced oxygen at-
mosphere would be a crucial factor

concert. The band cost $8,000, mak-
ing it more expensive than last year's 
headliner, They Might Be Giants, 
according to Louison. 

"You, hl!ve to realize that we got 
a really good deal on bands last 
year," said Louison. "We only paid 
about S8,OOO for all of our bands." 
Also performing Friday night will 
be the Omaha-based alternative band 
311. 

Louison said the local band D-
Side Players, combining acid, jazz 
and a I ittle salsa, will add diversity 
to the concert. The student-band 
Oversoul will lead off the evening. 

Falk and Louison both said they 
were pleased with the mix of bands 
which will be performing this year, 
though some students did not share 
their enthusiasm. 

"Who the heck are these bands?" 
asked sophomore Stacey Strong. 

"It sounds like it's going to be 
the same thing as it was last year and 
the year before that, except it's bands 
we've never heard of, " said Warren 
College Senior Chris Davis. "That's 
new." 

Strong was more positive about 
the new location of the concert. "It 
seems like it will be more open and 
fun and it will fit a lot more people, " 
she said. 

The concert is free to students

Psychedelic Unified Funk Fest 
(PUFF), which starts on Saturday at 
the Warren Mall, was originally in-
tended to be an event which would 
unite people from the five: colleges. 
Organizers later decided to sched-
ule the fair to coincide with the Sun 
God Festival. 

Funded by A.S. and several of 
the colleges, PUFF will include six 
bands and a number of cultural acts, 
as well as 10 vendors selling food 
and other items. The event cost ap-
proximately $12,000.

all literary merit," said Falk. "As 
[Greek Columns] exists ... it's a 
supplement to the Guordian ... not 
an alternative media and [it] should 
not be funded as such." 

However, President of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFq Greg Hearn 
objected to changing the format of 
Greek Columns, which is produced 
by members of IFC and Panhellenic 
councils. 

"We don't have a need for more 
than one page," said Hearn. "We 
don't need more money or a differ-
ent [format]. The A.S. is not here to 
micro-manage what we are doing 
with our alternative media." 

Mohommed, is from MTV's "The 
Real World," will headline Satur-
day's cow.:ert. MTV will be film-
ing the concert throughout the 
evening. 

The Cultural Awareness Net-
work will put on a cultural costume 
fashion show and Thai and 
Polynesian groups will perform tra-
ditional ethnic dances. 

Several PUFF organizers are con-
cerned about whether students will 
be willing to return to campus on 
Saturday after Friday night's con-
cert. "This is the firsltime that we 've 
done it like this, so we are worried," 
said Normy Chiou, the co-chair of 
the Finance Committee for PUFF. 
"Hopefully we're directing to a 
slighUy different [from Friday's] au-
dience." 

Hearn added that according to 
his understanding of the MediaChar-
ter, Greek Columns was not violat-
ing any by-laws. 

A.S. IFClPanheUenic represen-
tative Silvia Sfiligoi said that the 
A.S. should have no say in where an 
alternative media chooses to be pub-
lished. 

"That's a choice that [Greek CoI-
umns] made," said Sfiligoi. "It's a 
way of distribution. I don't think 
the A.S. should ever have a say in 
how alternative media is distrib-
uted. " 

Following the meeting, Shadab 
said that he planned to continue 
working on the issue.

The Paranoid N~videnC8 
Bandwagon Rolls On 

In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and the result-
ing militia fervor, it seems that political leaders are coming out 
of the woodwork, anxious to find any connection - however 
unlikely - to their own political causes. The media heightens 
this false connection, spoon-feeding it daily to the public with 
new "revelations" about militia anti-abortion activists and 
militia white supremacists. 

Two separate articles in a single issue of the San Diego 
Union-Tribune are the epitome of this blanket approach, 
suggesting every criminal act is a prerequisite to militia 
membership. However, upon closer examination of the facts, it 
becomes apparent that there is no substantial evidence that 
militias are tied to any of these activities, and the media has 
amplified what little evidence does exist. 

Rep. Charles Schumer, D-NY, espoused this philosophy at 
a recent news conference, saying, "We are here today to reveal 
an apparent link between right-wing paramilitary militias and 
radical anti-abortion forces." 

Schumer and his colleague, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-NY, 
believe the evidence for this pairing is "very trOUbling," and 
have called for hearings to investigate the "connection." But 
Schumer also said, "We are not saying that all or even a 
majority of anti-abortion groups or militias are violent or 
acting illegally." According to these two representatives, the 
only evidence that anli-abortion groups and mililias may be 
related is one quote from one abortion opponent - among 
millions in the United States. 

National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League 
President Kate Michelman followed suit, endorsing the 
hearings by saying, "A climate of hale and intolerance per-
vades our nation. The bombing in Oklahoma City was the 
most tragic and deadly manifestation of extremist groups and 
individuals who use violence to achieve their ends. " 

Equating the Oklahoma City bombing with the anti-
abortion movement is absurd. Just because two groups are 
extremist, does nol mean that they are linked. 

Yet the exaggerations' did nol stop there. A second story on 
the same page of Ihe Union-Tribune managed to paint another 
picture of militia involvement in criminal activily. Larry W. 
Harris, who allegedly obtained bubonic plague bacteria 
through the mail, "Iold colleagues al a food lesting lab he was 
a while supremacist and sympathetic to the militia movement," 
according to an Associated Press report. 

Media and government paranoia have blown an individual's 
actions out of proportion by lumping criminals, extremists and 
militia members together. Such assumptions jump to conclu-
sions. The criminal actions of an individual do not necessarily 
represent militias, whether or not he is a member. To include 
alleged militia sympathies in every accusation is a panicky 
display of the public's trendy obsession with militia groups. 
This fear of militias stems from allegations that Ihey were 
involved in the Oklahoma City bombing. However, this 
paranoia cannot be legitimized, considering there is no sub-
·stant.a1 evidence which shows militia involvement. 

Equating right-wing militias with criminal activity is 
strangely reminiscent of pairing left-wing communist groups 
with evil during 1950s McCarthyism. Fear borne of the 
Oklahoma City bombing goes further than a paranoid attempt 
10 connect wrongdoing to militias. Grouping right-wingers and 
criminals into a militia-spawned conglomeration of madmen 
only fills the public consciousness with a heightened sense of 
alarm over anything remolely on the right.

inevitably plagued by mismanagement and bad acoustics.

WARNING: SILENCE REDUCES ' 
RISK OF DEATH 

COMMENTARY: Opinions must be answered with open, intelligent 
~iscourse, not with anonymous threats to life and limb 

BRENT 

JuJUtsun 
Smells Like 
The Truth 

On May 5, Guardian Staff 
Writer Peter Chang received a 
death threat: "Eh homeboy, 
what shit you talkin' about Voz 
Fronteriza? We know where 
you live .... We're gonna nail 
your ass, puto .... " The next day, 
he received another: "Hey 
homeboy, look out for the 
drive-by." These anonymous, 
gutless warnings of impending 
eradication 
were made in 
response to a 
commentary 
Chang wrote 
about the 
Oticano news-

paper Voz Fronteriza. 

ating drug use in Latino communities, and ultimately 
reproaches the methods employed by the Chicanol 
Latino movement to achieve empowerment. If Chang 
is insulting anyone, it is the handful of people who 
publish the Voz, not the Chicano/Latino community. 
These insults do not extend to the realm of racism. 
Whether or not you 'feel Chang's assertions are igno-
rant of the facts - whatever the faets may be - his 
commentary in itself is not racist, despite Barra's 
claims. 

If there is overt prejudice in any publication on the 
campus, it can be found in Voz 
Fronteriza, which freely wields such 
labels as puto (fag), and gringo (a de-
cidedly derogatory designation for 
white people). "Chicken-shit" and 
"sellout" regularly brand Latinos and 
Chicanos who do not fully support the 
Chicano movement and the VOl. 

VOl Fronteriza Editor Harry Barra, 
after being informed of the calls, at-
tempted to separate himself and his 
newspaper from the threats: "We 
would like to disassociate ourselves 
from the death threats, but people need 
to understand that racist comments 
will create reactions like that. People 
in the future need to be more careful 
about what they say." 

~I.not 
allowed to 
make 

II can hardly be argued that the Voz 
is not biased. It makes generalizations 
such as "[proposition 187] turns ev-
ery Chicano MexiClUlO into a hunted, 
harassed, brutalized, criminalized and 
despised human being. It also makes 
a dream held by most gringos come 
true, which is to perform their patri-
otic duty by turning in and arresting 
Mexicans." 

In other words, we would like to 
disassociate ourselves from the death 
threats, but ...

These kinds of imprecise and inevi-
tably false observations have no veri-
fiable documentation, and form noth-
ing more than a point of view with 
which many people disagree. In effect, 
they are opinions - just as Chang's 
commentary is an opinion. The differ-

But what? The word "would" indi-
cates uncertainty - the word "but" 
confirms it. In effect, Barra wants to 
distance himself from the threats, but

cannot do so without the condition that people keep 
quiet about. certain issues. This is not surprising, con-
sidering Barra himself condones violence in his re-
sponse to Chang's commentary, calling for a "righ-
teous ass kicking" for Chang's "racist attack not only 
against Voz Fronteriza ... but against the Chicano com-
munity at UCSD and Mexicanos in general." 

However, Chang did not write a racist attack against 
anything or anyone. "Hypocrisy Alive and Well in Voz 
Fronteriza" is, first and foremost, a criticism of a news-
paper, VOl Fronteriza, which Chang describes as "ooz-
ing with paranoia." Chang follows up by disputing the 
VOl'S claims of govemment involvement in perpetu-

.., 

ence, however, is that Chang is not allowed to make 
. unsubstantiated claims. VOl writers, it seems, are un-

der no such constraints. 
It is not exceptional that many people disagree with 

Chang's point of view - the only people who seem to 
embrace his views are usually hard-core Republicans 
or Libertarians. However, the nature of an opinion sug-
gests that it is neither fact nor certainty - a definition 
which everyone seems to have forgotten. A Guardian 
opinion writer expresses his well thought~ut position 
on a concept or an event. If the editors had felt that 
Chang's piece was a racist attack, it would not have

COMMENTARY: Supplementing a UCSD education with independent reading is essential if 
. one wants to be considered an informed and employable member of the workforce 

DIVING HEADFIRST INTO A REAL EDUCATION 
ay ... terc ...... 
StsffWrlter 

That a UCSD diploma is a joke 
is something of I ill-kept secret -
a secret in the sense that a majority 
of UCSD students appear to remain 
blissfully unaware of their 
unemployability, and ill-kept in the 
sense that employers with any sense 
whatsoever avoid serious interviews 
at this campus. 

With the possible exception of an 
engineering degree, much of what 
passes for education at this univer-
sity is little more than political in-
doctrination, where imaginary ideas 
- like ethnic studies and socialism 
- are presented within the lexicon 
of credible, intelligent discourse. 
After four years (six, if you are one 
of the unfortunate souls at Revelle) 
of vigorously nodding our heads and 
behaving like good little lemmings 
to the purveyors of political correct-
ness, the educational establishment 
rewards us with a diploma for our 
compliance. 

This charade raises an interest-
ing question for the employer fool-
ish enough to recruit from our cam-
pus: How much does a UCSD stu-
dent know by the time he gradu-
ates? Not a whole lot, it turns out, 
if one looks at the General Cata-
log to see what it takes to gradu-
ate. 

What does a graduate know? 
He knows it's wrong to hate. He 

believes that the planet needs to be 
saved right now. He understands 

that knowing how to find a deriva-
tive won't do much for world 
peace. He knows not to use the 
word "he" as a third-person pro-
noun and knows to litter his writ-
ing with "her" and "their" as sub-
stitutes. His idea of diversifying a 
portfolio involves adding more 
drawings of African Americans to 
his sketchbook. 

Now imagine, for a moment, 
that you are a human-resources 
manager who needs to find intelli-
gent, responsible people with a ru-
dimentary understanding of scien-
tific principles and a competent 
grasp of critical analytic skills. 
Knowledge of mathematics and a 
proper command of the English 
language are assumed. Look at 
your resume. Be honest. Would you 
hire yourself! 

Uh-oh. Where's that graduate 
school brochure you threw out a 
month ago? 

You'd think four years of in-
struction would be enough to pre-
pare a student for adult living. In-
deed, before colleges and univer-
sities were commandeered by this 
current crop of multiculturalists, 
four years were more than 
enough. Fortunately, it is possible 
to pick up the slack where our 
school fails us and complete our 
education. Unfortunately, it in-
volves reading - something with 
which the MTV-addled college 
student might have too short an 
attention span to cope. Nonethe·

The Wall Street Journal: This

college students, and those wise 
enough to take advantage of it 
will find a wealth of useful infor-

mation at their command. Under-
standably, it can be difficult read-
ing if you are unfamiliar with the 
terminology of finance. However, 
the time you devote to under-
standing the Wall Street parlance 
is time well spent. In the long run, 
you'l l find that this single invest-
ment pays off in spades, in the 
coin of advancements and job 
opportunities. I go through two 
papers a day - The San Diego 
Union Tribune and The Wall 
Street Journal - but if I were 
forced to choose one, I'd take The 
Wall Street Journal. An auxiliary 
benefit to a subscription is the 
fact that the mean salary of a Wall 
Street Journal subscriber is in 
excess of $120,000. This means 
that your name and address show 
up on all sorts of cool mailing 
lists for catalogs full of nifty toys 
like $10,000 golf clubs which 
double as concealed one-shot 
rifles, brochures for anti-terrorist 
armoring kits for your Mercedes 
500E and pre-approved Gold 
Mastercards (which you can 
spend the living daylights out of 
and then skip town after you 
graduate). 

Go Rin No Sho (A Book of Five -
Rings) by Miyamato Musashi and 
TheArro/War by Sun Tzu: These 
classics of strategy are classroom 
staples in almost every Asi~ III-
tion currently cleaning our indus-
trial clock. Both writers were men 
of war: Musashi was a skilled 

swordsman who slew over 60 op-
ponents in duels, and Tzu was the 
commander of ancient China's vast 
army. In spite (or perhaps, because) 
of the fact that they wrote ostensi-

b�y about the martial arts and mili-
tary terminology, they contain bril-
liant insights into strategy, success 
and human motivation. That these 
books are found in the business 
section of most bookstores speaks 
volumes of the esteem to which 
they are held within professional 
circles. 

The Constilution 0/ the United 
States 0/ America: The extent to 
which supposedly college-edu-
cated people are ignorant of the 
fundamental and highest laws of 
this nation is a perpetual source 
of amazement to me. Polls indi-
cate that the average college 
graduate knows two of the rights 
guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. 
It has been said that the first step 
toward creating a totalitarian 
state is the existence of a popu-
lace ignorant of the laws which 
govern them. Anyone who reads 
the Bill of Rights will realize that 
the only provision and righ't 
which is not violated to one ex-
tent or another by our current 
government is the Third Amend-

COMMENTARY: Civilized life is often the victim of those inconsiderate ruffians 
who think they are the center of the universe 

THOUGHTLESS 'JERKS SCAR UCSD CAMPUS 
By Derek van Hoften 
Stsff Writer 

As our society erupts into a vio-
lent swarm of whining cynics, the 
last thing we need is more com-
plaining. Yet, every morning the 
newspaper greets us with cries and 
fusses from all segments of the 
population. Everyone is upset. 
Someone has been offended. Cul-
tural groups are at odds with In-
other. Another support group has 
been formed to comfort even more 
people who can't deal with the re-
alities of life. We have become a 
society of complainers. And rather 
thin break the trend, I have decided 
10 join the crowd and engage in my 
own bitching and moaning. Besides, 
if I choose not to complain, I might 
offend certain segments of the popu-
lation who Iren't as capable of be-
ing content. 

Amazingly enough, there is one 
thing that is more annoying than this 
incessant complaining: unnecessary 
rudeness. Granted, the two often go 
hand in hand, but rudeness abounds 
even in places where no complain-
ing takes place. And nowhere is 
rudeness more prevalent than on our 
own campus. Nary I day passes 
when at least two ignorant knaves 
fail to bump into me while walking 
blindly Icross campus, throwing 
powerful body blows which often 
send me hurling off to tbe side like 
some incoDSCquential gnlL Sadly, 
this is precisely how I'm trelted 

during the entire ordeal - like a 
gnat. 

I'll be strolling leisurely along 
the edge of a spacious pathway on 
campus when a herd of jabbering 
students come stampeding for-
ward, all of whom look sideways 
It each other, rather than Witching 
where they walk. I am genedlly 
left with one of three options: I can 
either speedily walk around the on-
coming mob; attempt to warn one 
of the herd; or stand my ground and 
await the inevitable collision. 
Since the first and second options 
should be unnecessary in any civi-
lized society, I opt for the last 
choice. 

After all, I have no obligation to 
move. I watch where I wllk, while 
my Ittackers pay no attention. Why 
do these people consider themselves 
10 be so important that they expect 
others to move out of the way for 
them? If everyone perused the cam-
pus with a disregard displlyed by 
these people, our campus would be 
awash with massive collisions and 
strewn with wounded students and 
faculty. As it is, the sideways-look-
ers leave it up to the few remaining 
polite students to avoid such calam-
ity. However, polite doesn't neces-
sarily mean passive, and it's about 
time the polite walkers of the world 
stopped stepping aside for the igno-
rant and rude masses. 

The most amazing aspect of 
these collisions is what occurs af-

no crime. They generally grow hos-
tile and wrongly berate the innocent 
victims who happen to have wound 
up on their backs in the mud. Even 
worse, the attackers often have the 
audacity to confront the fallen ca-
sualties and accuse them of block· 
ing their paths by not moving out 
of the way. 

Still, this rudeness pervades an-
otber more hillowed hall of cam-
pus life: the classroom. Here, we 
find the single-most vexatious, ag-
gravating and annoying display of 
the rudeness which plagues modem 
society: talking during lecture. Al-
most nothing can top fhis ultimate 
exhibition of boorishness. This 
manifestation of elementary school 
behavior is expected in mandatory 
lower-division classes composed of 
students fresh out of high school. In 
upper-division classes, however, 
most students generally want to 
learn the material. The talkers don't 
recognize that other students might 
actually want to listen 10 the lecture. 
In addition, they completely disre-
spect the professor. Most of them 
seem to think that professors can't 
hear them whispering and giggling 
in the back of the room like a gaggle 
of junior high school cheerleaders 
who have a crush on the gym 
teacher. 

But the ultimate breach of class· 
room etiquette occurs toward the 
end of class when a few impatient 
morons start gathering their things 

togf;ther so they can escape the hor-
rible Iortures of class 32 seconds 
early. These students rustle and zip 
their bags not only so they can leave 
early, but also to warn the professor 
that the end is near and they are 
growing bored. 

This behavior begs one final 
question: What the hell are these 
people doing at the lectures at all? 
Those who chat back and forth are 
obviously not paying attention to the 
professor and therefore are DO bet-
ter served inside the classroom than 
outside. This leaves us with three 
possible explanations: First, they 
don't care about the class at all, in 
which case they shouldn't have 
shown up; second, they take inter-
mittent notes and decide 10 disrupt 
the class when the professor is in-
sensitive enough to lecture on a bor-
ing subject; and third, they already 
know the material and are simply 
rude people who see nothing wrong 
with disturbing the rest of the class. 
Or perhaps it's a combination of all 
three. 

Normally I would be concerned 
that this scathing tirade might ap-
pear a bit cynical or offensive. But 
it's only one more complaint thrown 
in with the rest. People don't really 
expect others to respect their cries 
of injustice, do they? But if they do, 
and if my tirade has actually of-
fended anyone, I'll be sure to form 
a support group for everyone who 
feels a need to complain.

been published. 

I can't begin to count the num-
ber of times I've heard the GUIlrd-
ian accused of being "sensational-
istic" since Chang's article was pub-
lished: One person said, "You guys 
knew this would cause a scandal. 
There are enough divisive issues ' 
between racial groups already. The 
paper didn't need to publish that 
article." Of course the Guardian 
didn't need to publish it. However, 
there was no reason not 10 publish 
it, either. 

Ideally, the opillion section of a 
newspaper contains highly contro· 
versial commentaries. If a newspa-

down the minds of elementary 
school students - we in America 
can't enjoy this until we get to col-
lege - the United States has been 
surprisingly lax in defending its eco-
nomic system and teaching its philo-
sophical foundations to our young 
people. Quoting the philosophical 
defense of capitalism at a job inter· 
view can make even the mediocre 
candidate look erudite and intelli-
gent. 

Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand: In 
a similar vf,:in, this classic struggle 
between the genius of productivity 
and the destructive poison of medi-
ocrity offers insight culled from 
Rand's experiences in the oppres-
sive socialist USSR. Rand offers a 
compelling argument in defense of 
capitalism in her brilliant allegory, 
and its lessons would well serve the 
college graduate in understanding 
the dignity of hard labor and the 
value of the work ethic .

premium on the ability to slog

statement, coming from the edi-

makes a practice of regularly 
blasting whites and "sellout" 
Mexicans - is the ultimate sanc-
timony. Besides falsely identify-
ing Chang's commentary as rac-

intended as a warning to all 
people who may write against the

TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS FOR 
SUN GOD FESTIVAL 

Editor: 
On Friday, May 19, the 13th 

annual Sun God Festival will be 
held at the Sun God Lawn, with 
an evening concert located be-
tween the Engineering Building 
and Warren Lecture Hall. This 
year, the Sun God Festival 
Committee and ASUCSD is 
proud to present The Pharcyde 
and special guests 311, the B-
Side Players, Oversoul and DJ 
Greyboy. 

This year, due to the construc-
tion of the Library Walk, the ca-
pacity of the Price Center has di-
minished from 5,000 to about 
2,000. ' 

While the construction has 
minimal impact on the actual 
size of the plaza, it carries im-
mense repercussions on en-
trances and, more importantly, 
exits in the event of an emer-
gency. 

In past years, a large num-
ber of parties being held before 
and during the concert resulted 
in a great deal of intoxicated

hope students will party respon-
sibly and leave their alcohol be-

hind. 
Please keep in mind that this 

concert is open to UCSD students 
and their guests (18 and over) 
only. Everyone will be asked to 
show proper identification. Any 
visibly intoxicated individuals 
will be denied entry. Also, the fol-
lowing items will not be allowed 
into the venue: containers, food, 
beverages and photographic or re-
cording devices. All bags, back-
packs and purses will be subject 
to search. 

We ask students to be tolerant 
of these precautionary measures so 
that future festivals will not be 
jeopardized. 

ASUCSD is aware that these 
precautions may seem overly 
protective. However, ASUCSD 
does not want future program-
ming restricted as a result of the 
actions of a few reckless students. 
With your help, this year's festi-
val will be the most successful 
yet.

NCAA DIVISION III GOLF NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS 

.059. 
The Clippers' winning 

percentage? Shaquille 
O'Neill's free-throw average? 
No, this miserable statistic was 
the batting average for baseball 
pitcher John Burkett last year. 
Such a shameful statistic 
symbolizes the National 
League's crying need for the 
designated hitter. 

UCSD Storms First RoUnd 
. RAIN: Triton golfers shoot a 309, third-place 
total between showers at the NCAAs yesterday 

Of course. there are critics 
of the DH, those that believe it 
undermines the 'purity' of the 
game. I guess it does-if one 
defines 'pure' baseball as a 
game in which pitchers go 0-
for-4 with two strikeouts. 
Pitchers hit about as well as 
Michael Jordan. That is to say, 
they can't. 

Baseball, in its purest form, 
is a game in which a ball is hit, 
and this skill is noticeably 
lacking in NL pitchers. Need 
proof! J list scan the box scores 
in yesterday'S paper and you'll 
see what I'm talking about. 

On Tuesday, 14 National 
League pitchers went a 
combined l-for-24 with 11 
strikeouts, no runs and no 
RBis. This amounts to a .041 
batting average - an insipid 
clip that is even a far cry from 
the infamous Mendoza line 
(.200), baseball's measure of 
mediocrity. John Smoltz, in 
particular, should be slapped 
for his exercise in futility. He 
went O-for-4 with three Ks.

Sports Editor 

Torrential rain, late starts and 
sloppy conditions haven't been able 
to stop the efforts of the UCSD golf 

II II team at the NCAA Di-vision ((( National 
Championships in 
Terre Haute, IN. 

• The Tritons 
smashed their way to a 
third-place finish after 
the first round, tallying 

a 309 team total overall. Otterbein 
College leads with a 293, while 
Methodist is in second with a 302. 

"Each player has been issued a 
life raft," UCSD Head Coach Mike 
Wydra said. "It's been raining so 
much that the Wabash river is crest-
ing ... and the course is tough enough 
as it is without all this rain." 

With play that Wydra described 
as "un-boll-weevil-able," Alex 
Behrend led the Tritons in the first 
round of play, shooting a solid 74. It 
was good enough for a fifth-place 
finish in individual standings. 

Behrend birdied the 18th hole 
and hit several lengthy drives on the 
high-yardage course - all despite 
his proven reputation as a short, 
accurate hitter. 

"The course was very sloppy with 
greens like buller," Behrend said. 
"But, I think we're in great shape. 

As for [top] individual honors, I've 
cast the line, and now I'm ready to 
reel it in." 

Pete Roberts grabbed the num-
her-two team slot for UCSD, notch-
ing a 76. His score was good enough 
for a three-way tie for 16th place. 
Teammate Arnie Campbell blitzed 
the third Triton team slot with a 
26th-place, 78. 

"Otterbein is playing out of its 
mind, and Methodist is simply a 
very good program," Wydra said. 
"We're doing just fine. If [NCAA 
officials) end up condensing the 
number of rounds to play, however, 
we could be in trouble." 

UCSDteamcaptainTom Brown, 
fighting the flu, shot a disappoint-
ing 81 on the first day of play. Ac-
cording to Wydra, Brown will be 
"wearing his red pajamas and wrap-
ping towels~round himself' to sweat 
out the fever overnight. 

Jim O'Grady snagged the final 
team spot for the Tritons, slipping to 
an 87 -stroke total on the day. This is 
O'Grady's first time at Nationals-
an opportunity he earned by beating 
out Jeremy Byrd for the last spot. 

. "[O'Grady] ~...as feeling a little 
tight," Wydra said. "He hits the ball 
so hard, that sometimes the ball goes 
hard in the wrong direction. " 

UCSD will try to fit in rounds 
two through four over the weekend. 

Pet. Roberts Is the seconcWeadInC scorer for the Tritons 10 .. , 
notchl..,. 76 on the first clay of pI.y In Terre ... ut •• IN. The alarming fact is that 

Smoltz is the rule instead of 
the exception. All pitchers 
stink at hitting. That's why 
they're called pitchers. Even 
the best-hitting pitchers 
compile miserable stats: Orel 
Hershiser, regarded as one of 
the top-hitting hurlers, batted a 
measly .205 last season with a 
scant 4 ribbies. 

PCRCs Loom Large for UCSD Crew 
MEDALS: The Tritons expect big things at this weekend's Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 

So what can be done? 
Why not make the DH 

standard in both leagues? That 
way, older players who are 
losing their speed and defen-
sive skills will be able to 
prolong their careers. Just look 
at guys like Eddie Murray and 
Kirk Gibson, who would be 
out on the street were it not for 
the DH. A number of retired 
players could also get back 
into the game. Guys like Robin 
Yount and George Brett would 
come out of the woodwork to 
fill the need for new h·ilters. 

And when forced to choose 
between Yount and Burkett, 
the choice is pretty clear. I'd 
take old hitters over non-
hitters any day.

Do-or-die. Now-or-never. Put-
up-or-shut up. These are all appli-
cable phrases for the UCSD crew 

team as it rolls 
into this 
weekend's sea-
son finale at the 
Pacific Coast 
Rowing Cham-
pionships 
(PCRCs) in Sac-
ramento. 

Both the men and women's 
squads have high hopes for their 
boats in this, the biggest of all races 
for the Triton rowers. 

The competition will be stiff, 
however. All the schools from the 
Pacific Coast have been extended 
an invitation, and the only group not 
participating are the Pac-lO schools.

But Oregon will be in attendance, 
and the University of Colorado will

fray for the first time in its history. 

The Triton women have boats in 
the varsity- and lightweight-fours, 
the quad (a sculling event), as well 
as novice-eight 'A' and 'B' crews. 

"All five crews have a good 
chance at medaling," Women 's 

Head Coach Jack Vallergasaid. "It's 
been a long time since we had that 
many contending crews." 

The men's team will most likely 
send a varsity and a junior varsity-
eight boat, with hopes riding on the 
shoulders of the varsity crew. Two 
weekends ago, the men's squad came 
in fourth behind UC Davis, Sacra-

. mento State and UCSB in a race

"This is a big event. It's the first 
year where teams will be asking 
'Are we going to win?' instead of 
• Are we going to make the grand 
final," UCSD Men's Head Coach 
Doug Theimann said. 

With the possibility of numerous 
medaling boats looming large for 
the Tritons, their enthusiasm cannot 
be contained. 

"I'm pretty excited," Vallerga 
said. "I wish it was Saturday, so I 
could see how fast we were going." 

If performances in this years' big 
eventareupto par, the UCSDcrews 
may consider extending their sea-

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Archery 

~ The UCSD ar-chery team has been shooting for first place all year in the 
California Division 

Conference, and it has proved over 
the course of the season that it can 
hang with the best. 

In only their second year of 
existence, the Triton men's and 
women's teams got off to quick 
starts and even maintained their 
momentum throughout the year. 

In UCSD's first tourney of the 
year, the Marine Corps' "Toys for 
Tots" Triton Shoot, the Triton ar-
chersshot extremely well. Standout 
Brian Sanders grabbed first-place. 

"This toumament was for a good 
cause, and we were glad to partici-
pate," UCSD's Jeff Tan said. 
"[Sanders) is one of our leaders." 

The Triton archers' next tourna-
ment, the L.A. Indoor Challenege 
in Anaheim, CA, was also a suc-
cess, as both the women and men 
notched several solid performances. 

Sanders once again finished first 
overall, proving himself to be one of 
the elite. He got help from the efforts 
of fellow teammates Tan and Rob 
Johnson, while the women's team 

was led by Lisa Yamarnato, Karen 
Clten and Danielle Akaky. 

In March, the Triton shooters 
placed well at the UCSD Open-
Spring Tournament, a dual meet 
against Cal State Long Beach. The 
men's team captured several first- _ 
and third-place finishes, while the 
women '5 squad earned second and 
third in the Women's Recurve di-
vision. Johnson finished first in 
Men's Compound category. 

"The year's going really well," 
Tan said. "It's an enjoyable sport, 

... . 

and we are a young team, so we 
have a lot· of room for improve-
ment next year." 

Having faced schools from Ari-
zona and the East, UCSD now be-
gins a West Coast swing, going up 
against Davis, UCLA and Cal 
State-Long Beach. 

The Tritons will compete for 
the California State Outdoor Cham-
pionship - the event was origi-
nally scheduled at UCSD earlier 
this year, but it was rained out -
on June 24-25 at Long Beach, CA. 

"It's definitely a great competi-
tion, and all the schools are going 
to be there," Tan said.

Cycling 

Last weekend wu 

_

crunch time for the 
UCSD cycling team, 
u they traveled to 

Cal State San Luis 
Obispo for the NCAA Regionals 
- and a chance to qualify for the 
Championships in two weeks. De-
spite a rocky performance from the 
previously consistent squad, UCSD 
managed to capture an NCAA berth. 

On Saturday morning, the Tri-
tons competed in a team time-trial 
over a flat, IS-mile course. The 
only notable results for the UCSD 
cyclers were third-place finishes 
both in the men's' A' and 'B' divi-
sions. 

Saturday's event presented a 
challenging, 6O-mileroad race. The 
Tritons were unable to gamer any 
significant honors, but Adam 
Livingston (men's' A') came clos-
est to breaking the UCSD silence in 
top finishes. 

Livingston attacked with 10 
miles to go in the race and extended 
to a significant lead before the field 
began to reel him in. Unfortunately 
for the Tritons, Livingston was 
caught by the pack a mere 200 
meters from the finish line. His

breakaway attempt 
had left him too tired 
to sprint with the 
pack, and he fell 
deep into the final 
standings . . 

"That was a real 
heartbreaker," team 
captain Erik Stauber 
said. "[Livingston] 
was so close to vic-
tory." 

Sunday after-
noon brought more 
disappointment for 
the UCSD squad, as 
crashes eliminated 
top performers Mark

Luckily, 
Sunday's Criterium

Sanders sped to a second-place 
award, after breaking away from 
the field with a rider from UClrvine. 

Livingston also placed well in 
men's' A,' coming in closely on the 
heels of his coach to take home 
sixth place - with his second con-

secutive strong showing. 
"Basically, we had a bad week-

end when it was important that we 
did well," Stauber said. "But we 
still barely qualified for Nationals, 
based on consistently good perfor-
mances during the season."

Forget Deion. 
Two-sport 
stars shine in 
UCSD's 
athletic 
programs. 

By"'n Rahlml, 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Guardian 

Move over, Do and Deion. Here come Matt ~ineban, JoyCie Lee, ShaWDB Ca-
ballero, Matt Aune and Kelly 
McGlothlin. They might not be 
household names yet, but these ath-
letes accomplish feats of great mag-
nitude right here at UCSD. 

Playing one sport is hard 
enough, eapecially at a campus 
whicb doesn't always support its 
atbletes. But it's even worse for 
those wbo play two sports, consid-
ering that academics, not sports, 
come first at this school. 

UCSD student athletes don't 
get special favors. There aren't 
majors like "physical education," 
and there aren't special tutoring 
sessions. Triton athletic stars are 
challenged to succeed in sports 
and academics. 

These facts make the accom-
plishments of Minehan, Cabal-

lero, Lee, Aune and McGlothlin 
all the more astounding. 

While sports today revolves 
around greedy ballplayers, huge con-
tracts and egotistical professionals, 
UCSD's two-sport stars work twice 
as hard, travel twice as often and 
produce twice the results-all with-
out tbe all-loa-familiar ego. 

A perfect example of this down-
to-earthness is Joyce Lee, a transfer 
to UCSD from Cal Poly Pomona in 
the spring of 1993. Lee is a defen-
sive specialist in volleyball, and she 
runs tbe l00-yard dash, the 4xlOO 
relay, and the 4x400 relay for the

"They are eacb very distinct 
sports," Lee said. "In volleyball, it's 
more of a team-oriented sport, 
wbereu track is more of an indi-
vidual game. I'm a more team-ori-
ented person, so volleyball is a bit 
more familiar. 

"I never thought I'd be doing 
well, but I give alot of credit to my 
track coach, 
Wes Williams. 
He's helped me 
very much ... I 
have a lot of re-

THREE 

Funk-oriented 
band will 
perform at 
the Sun God 
Festival 

ive years ago, 311 
singer Nicholas 
Hexum was in Ger-
many when he got a 
call from his friend, 

drummer Chad Sexton. 
Hexum, guitarist Timothy J. 
Mahoney and Sexton had been 

in a band called Unity in Omaha, 
Neb., and while Hexum was in 
Gennany, Sexton had secured 
the opening slot for a Fugazi 
concert. When he told Hexum 
he'd like to have him come back 
for the show, he couldn't tum 
him down. 

"It was a great chance for 
exposure," Hexum said during 
a phone interview from Los An-
geles, where he was on a break: 
from recording a cover of a Bad 
Brains song for a compilation 
album. "From that day on, we 
were known around town. We 
just kept building the band up 
and selling our tapes. I feel re-
ally fortunate that we had that 
springboard to start off, instead 
of starting off in front of five 
people in some bar somewhere. 
It was a great chance to hit the 
ground running, and it worked 
out really good." 

Although the band quickly 
became a local sensation in 
Omaha, constant touring has in-
creased its popularity elsewhere 
in the U.S. The popularity of the band, 
whose members now reside in Los 
AngeJes, has spread with the release of 
two albums, Music and Grassroots. 
The band just finished recording its 
third, self-titled album, which will be 
released on July 23. Hexum said that 
recording the album with producer 
Ron Saint Gennain (Bad Brains, liv-
ing Colour, Tool) went so weU that the 
group had several soop leftover, which 
it hopes to contnbute to a soundtrack. 

Although one might not expect to 
hear a funk-influenced band coming 
out of Omaha, Hexum said he was 

turned on to hip-hop when he spent a 
year in Washington, D.C. while his 
father was on sabbatical from the Uni-
versity of Nebraska. 

"One thing that changed my musi-
cal outlook is that I moved to Wash-
ington D.C. and took a bus to school. 
Everyone would be singing songs like 
'Rappers Delight,'" he said. "When 
Run DMC and the Beastie Boys came 
along. it was like the next day after 
punk for me. Prince was also a big 
influence." 

Hexum said the band, which has 
played at UCSD in the past year, is 

Courtesy of DIrtn Blick 

looking fOlWard to playing the Sun 
God Festival. 

"It's the first date of a 10-day West 
Coast tour," Hexum said. "'Then we 
take a couple weeks off and hit the 
road for a long time, starting in mid-
June. Playing shows is the fun part. 
It's just a pain in the ass to put all our 
stuff in storage and move." 

311 will perform tomorrow with 
The Pharcyde, B-Side Players, 
Oversoul and DJ Greyboy at the Sun 
God Festival at UCSD' s W men Mall. 
311 will return to San Diego to play 
with Kom on May 28 at SOMA live.

The Invisible Circus 
Two-person circus creates unique magic 

By C.re Udell 
Staff Writer 

"The Invisible Circus" ("I.e Cir-
que Invisible") is a unique theatrical 
extravaganza unlike any other. Show-
ing for the firsttimeon the West Coast 
at the La Jolla Playhouse, the show 
includes magic, comedy, music, acro-
batics and other specialty acts. Every· 
thing you see is performed entirely by 
two people. Created by Pari-
sians Victoria Chaplin 
(daughter of Charlie 
Chaplin) and Jean Baptiste 
Thierree, this collaborative 
work combines several as-
pects of the traditional cir-
cus in a new and distinct 
way, similar to the success-
ful production of "Cirque de Soleil." 

Without using any dialogue, the 
couple performs an assortment·of in: 
novative sketches fuU of colorful cos-
tumes, comical pantomime and ere-

ative physical transformations. 
Chaplin and Thieme utilize every-
day objects such as bicycle wheels, 
bells and kitchenware in amazing 
ways. Each act requires imagination 
and ingenuity. 

Chaplin is the more versatile and 
exceptional performer. She slides, 
writhes and dances across the stage, 
continuously turning herself into dif-

ferent forms and creatures. 
Through contorted move-
ments, acrobatics and cos-
tume changes, Chaplin 
metamorphoses into a pair 
of birds, a horse and other 
more exotic animals. 

Other clever stunts by 
Chaplin include the balanc-

ing of different objects, such as chairs, 
on her body and playing music on 
metal pots and glasses which are stra· 
tegically attached to herbody. Chaplin 
displays skill in both the creation and

performance of her diverse acts. 
Chaplin's husband Thieme acts 

as both magician and clown. In a 
burlesque manner, he makes his way 
across and around the circular stage 
wearing a white Shirley Temple wig 
and a perpetual grin. In one scene, he 
blows soap bubbles into the air and 
proceeds to hit them with a hammer, 
while simultaneously producing a bell 
sound which appears to be coming 
from the bursting bubbles. He per-
forms these quick but comically cre· 
ative skits throughout the show. 

But in the end, besides being silly, 
acting out different personages and 
performing some interesting magic 
tricks, Thierree can't match Chaplin. 
He simply kills time until she takes 
center stage. 

"The Invisible Circus" runs 
through June 1 1 at the Mandell Weiss 
Theater. For more information, call

In thewakeoftheOldahoma bomb-

iog, Plollywood has responded by 
axing a bomb-related episode of the 
TV series "'The Critic" and consider-
ing alternations to the final episode of 
"Melrose Place," which includes a 
scene in which Kimberly detonates a 
bomb in the apartment com-
plex. But Die Hurd With A 
Vengeance does not shy 
away from a single detail of 
its action-packed storyline. 

Detective Joho McClane 
(Bruce Willis), Iastseen hug-
ging and kissing his wife 
after he stopped a plane hi · 
jacking ioDie Hard 2, is down on his 
luck once again. Separated from his 
wife, McClane is recovering from a 
bad hangover when the busy Bonwit 

Teller department store in New York 
is bombed. 

Simon (Jeremy Irons) becomes 
McClane's nemesis, stopping at noth· 
ing to see him humi~ated. Simon, 
who precedes his threats by sayil!.8 
"Simon says," telephones McClane, 
telling him what he has to do to pre-
vent another detonation. After the ini· 
tial bombing, Simon makes McClane 

go to Harlem, stripped 
down to hi.s scivies and 
wearing a sandwich board 
with a racist epitaph on it. 

In Harlem, Zeus 
(Samuel L. Jackson), an 
electronicsstoreownerwho 
distrusts whites (especially 
if they are cops) saves 

McClane from a beating by the local 
gang. From then on, Simon irisists 
that Zeus must accompany McClane 
to save New York from a bomb spree.

The Black Cmwes 
Band reflects on recent benefit 

concert in Oklahoma City 
By Tony Perez-G .... 
Staff Writer 

1be Black Crowes, currently on 
tour in support of their third album, 
Amorica, have booked their con-
certs at small venues to create a 
more intimate environment 1be 
shows have received rave 
reviews, and the Crowes 
pride themselves on play-
ing a different set each 
night. During a recent 
phone interview, bassist 
Johnny Colt spoke about 
the band's open policy 
toward bootlegging and 

[in the Midwest] people are spooked. 
In Kansas City I went to dropoffa bag 
at our hotel. The bag had, IiteraUy, 
two bottles of water in it, and the 
woman at the hotel didn't want to take 
the bag from me. This is in Kansas 
City and she said, "I don't want to take 

any explosives." So if 
they're feeling that way in 
Kansas City, I'm sure its 
even worse in Oklahoma.
