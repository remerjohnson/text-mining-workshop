Earthquake Rocks San Francisco Bay Area, 
UCSF Staff Members Killed In 1-880 
Collapse; Campus and Labs Damaged 
By CHARLES PILLAR 
UCSF Synapse 

The earthquake that rocked San 
Francisco and damaged much of 
the San Francisco Bay Area early 
Tuesday evening did more than 
cause considerable damage to 
equipment and buildings on the 
University of California, San 
Francisco's Parnassus Heights 
campus. 

Four UCSF employees travel-
ing in a campus vanpool were 
among those killed along the 
Nimitz freeway in Oakland: De-
lores Stewart, a clerical assistant in 
the chancellor's office; Raymonde 
Beauregard-Sund of the anaesthe-
siology department and Donna 
Marsden and Lonna Lee of the 

radiology department. 
Three other employees were 

seriously injured when the over-
pass collapsed: Margaret Fitzpa-
trick, a clinical lab technician, 
Catherine Scarpa, an administra-
tive nurse in Nursing Education 
and Research; and Judith Jester, 
Research Associate in the surgery 
department. 

Three members of the vanpoo I 
were not aboard when the quake 
struck: Sandy Owyang of environ-
mental health and safety and Joan 
Kazerounian and Cheryl Weisker 
from nursing. One other member 
of the vanpool is unaccounted for. 

No injuries were reported on 
campus, only varying degrees of 
individual fright and concern as 
students, staff and faculty poured 

Threatening Call Leads to 
Sexual Assault of Student 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

A UCSD student was sexu-
ally assaulted early Sunday 
morning, after a male phone 
caller coerced her to meet him in 
downtown San Diego, UCSD 
Police said. 

The victim received a phone 
call at her residence hall on Sun-
day at approximately 3 a.m., 
according to UCSD Police De-
tective Sgt. Bob Jones. 

Jones said the caller pre-
tended, as a way to keep the 
victim on the line, that he knew 
an acquaintance of the victim, 
and "the conversation evolved 
into threats where she feared'for 
her safety." 

The caller coerced the victim, 
through threats, to drive to down-
town San Diego to meet him, 
Jones said. 

"She felt that [going to San 
Diego] was better than the alter-
natives he laid out over the 
phone," Jones said. 

Jones would not elaborate on 
the "very convincing" threats, 
except to ay they were of a 
violent, but not sexual, nature. 

In San Diego, the victim was 
sexually assaulted by the caller. 

Inside ... 

Jones would not relate the exact 
nature of the attack, except to 
say it was not a rape. 

"We have some investigative 
reasons why we don't want to 
explain exactly what happened," 
Jones said. 

The victim reported the crime 
to the police on Sunday after-
noon. 

As to the victim's current 
condition, Jones said, "I 
wouldn't say she's fine ... I 
would just say that she's back 
attending class." 

The suspect remains at large, 
and "there's no indication that 
w.ould lead us to believe the 
suspect has any association at 
all with the school," said San 
Diego Police Detective Ken 
Creese. 

"We have several leads we're 
following up on," Creese added. 

According to police reports, 
the suspect is a 5' 10" white male, 
approximately 24 years old, 190-
200' pounds, with short brown 
curly hair and a moustache. He 
wore dark blue jeans and a gray 
pullover sweater. 

Laurie Mackenzie, director 
of the San Diego Rape Crisis 
Center, said that while she had

out of the buildings at 5:04 p.m. 
The computers at the UCSF 

Center for Educational Develop-
ment (CED) in the Mission Dis-
trict were damaged when water 
pipes burst. The red brick CED 
building, which houses the ac-
counting department and mailing 
division, was closed on Wedne-
sady pending structural review and 
clean-up. 

On the Pamassus Campus, the 
worst effects were felt in the anat-
omy department and the Cardio-
vascular Research Institute 
(CVRI). On the 13th floors of Long 
and Moffitt Hospitals and the 
Medical Sciences Building, lab 
equipment was severely damaged 
and many experiments were ru-
ined by the temblor. 

Windows were broken and a 
small crack opened between UC 
hospital and the Medical Sciences 
Building. Both buildings were used 
without restrictions, however, as 
Synapse went to press at noon on 
Wednesday .. 

"All things considered, I think 
we fared pretty well," concluded 
UCSF Police Lieutenant Yolanda 
Morton on the morning after the 
quake. She said that an initial as-
sessment indicates that no Pamas-
sus Campus buildings have suf-
fered structural damage. 

Bob Meion, project superinten-
dent in charge of the new library, 
reported that the soon-to-be-com-
pleted building showed no crack-
ing or other ill effects. 

Library Project Manager Paul 
Gilles watched the giant construc-
tion crane sway as the earth moved, 
and heard the massive counter-
weights clang against each other, 
but it, too, weathered the quake 
well. 

Dr. Robert Hamilton's lab in 
the anatomy department was 
among the most severely disrupted. 
It looked like it had been turned 
upside-down, with experimental 
glassware smashed and scattered, 
with furniture and equipment 
tossed about. 

The UCSF environmental 
health and safety office cordoned 
off and set about cleaning up that 
lab and several others on the 13th 
floor, to ensure that no one was 
exposed to toxic chemicals that

Ethnic Group Questions 
UC Minority Statistics 
By JASON SNELL 
Contributing Writer 

Though the University of 
California's affirmative action 
program has been commended by 
UC President David P. Gardner for 
causing "dramatic" changes, sev-
eral minority groups claim that the 
University is still making little 
progress in minority hirings. 

According to figures released 
by Gardner's office, 48.6% of all 
professors hired in the UC system 
last year were either minorities, 
women or both. 

John C. Gamboa, executive 
director of the Latino Issues Fo-
rum and the co-chair of the His-
panic Coalition on Higher Educa-
tiOR, sees Gardner's figures as 
misleading. 

"It has been my experience that 
institutions combine statistics for 
• women and minorities' when they 
have made little or no progress for 
blacks and Hispanics," Gamboa 
said. 

"We hear a lot of talk," he con-
tinued, "but we don't see much in 
the way of progress. I would be 
embarrassed if I were President 
Gardner." 

Gardner's office did, however, 
release figures for specific minor-
ity hiring levels. The number of 
Hispanics in executive and mana-
gerial positions in the UC rose 
from 3.7% to 4.2%, and the num-
ber in professional positions rose 
from 4.3% to 5%. 

Despite the increase, Gamboa 
sees the University of California 
as having taken few steps to en-
courage minority hirings, going so 
far as to blame Gardner personally 
for a lack of support. 

"When [Hispanic, Black, and 
Asian minority groups] met with 
President Gardner earlier this 
month, he told us that he was 
powerless to do anything about the 
situation," Gamboa explained. 
"For a man who makes twice as

Theological Scholar To Discuss 
King, Malcolm X Legacy Today 

James H. Cone, theological scholar, ordained mini -
ter, and author of such works as God of the Oppressed 
and My Soul Looks Back will speak both to student and 
the general public today at UCSD. 

Cone will begin by holdmg an open student collo-
quium on "The Legacy of Martin and Malcolm" at 3:30 
p.m. in the Price Center, Gallery A. 

After the colloquium, Cone will lecture on the subject 
"Martin and Malcolm on America: A Dream or a Night-
mare?" at 8 p.m. in room 108, Peterson Hall. Admission 
is free. 

Soviet Defector, Former KGB Agent 
Slated To Speak At Price Center 

Stanislav Levchenko, a Soviet KGB major who, in 
1979, defected from a sensitive espionage action in 
Tokyo to take asylum in the United States, will speak at 
UCSD's Price Center Ballroom at 8 p.m. on November 
8. 

Now a U.S. Justice Department employee, Levch-
enko works as a consultant on espionage cases, tours the 
lecture circuit , and write . His first book, On the Wrong 
Side: My Life in fhe KGB, will be followed by an 
espionage novel, to be co-authored with his fiancee 
Alexandra Costa, a former Soviet Embassy employee. 

Levchenko now lectures against the Soviet system, 
which he calls morally and politically bankrupt. He 
cautions the United States to be wary of the new detente, 
saying that Soviet espionage activity has, if anything, 
increased underneath the openness of glasnost. 

According to Levchenko, California is a prir.1e target 
for Soviet spying, especially universities which foster 
high technology education and research. The universi-
ties Levchenko mentions as high-risk institutions in-
clude USC, UCLA, Stanford, UC Berkeley , and UCSD. 

Tickets for the Levchenko lecture are $9 for general

MINORITY: Ethnic Group 
Challenges UC Statistics 
Continued from page 1 

much money as the President of 
the United States, he seems to do 
very little." 

Gardner, however, reiterated 
that the UC still has a long way to 
go in the way of affirmative action. 

"Much remains to be done .. , 
[the University must] encompass 
more fully the cultural, socio-eco-
nomic, ethnic, and racial charac-
teristics of our state within the 
University community," Gardner 
wrote in a letter accompanying the 
new statistics. 

According to Gardner's office, 
an increase of over two percent in 
the number of UC contracts with 

minority-owned businesses oc-
curred between 1985 and 1989. 
Gamboa disputed this claim. 

"There are absolutely no guide-
lines set down to differentiate 
minority-owned businesses from 
other businesses. That figure in-
cludes owners who choose not to 
reveal their specific ethnic origins," 
he said. 

The University of California's 
press release regarding affirmative 
action discussed the new programs 
designed to increase minority hir-
ings. One such program is the 
Target of Opportunity Program 
(TOP), which was first imple-
mented at UCSD in 1982-83 and is 
now used throughout the UC sys-

The UCSD Guardian 

tern. The TOP allows campuses to 
hire female and minority scholars 
when there are open faculty posi-
tions. 

"The Office of the President 
does a lot of talking, but we have 
seen little action," Gamboa argued. 
"There are problems which are 
pervasive throughout the UC sys-
tem, but they all start at the top." 

While Gamboa criticized what 
he views as a lack of support from 
the UC president, he was encour-
aged by the change of attitudes in 
regard to minority hiring. 

"Because of our demands," he 
said, "there has been a lot of con-
sciousness raising- which is prog-
ress, in a way. Though that in-
creased awareness hasn't mani-
fested itself in concrete gains in 
minority hirings now, we hope that 
we will see them in the future."

might have mixed together as glass-
ware broke, 

Hamilton said that "We have no 
ideaofthe extent of damage" to the 
research. 

"There is nothing so precious in 
my work that you can't start over 
and do it again," he added. 

His office desk was buried under 
hundreds of pounds of book-
shelves, books and papers. "If I 
had been there, I would have been 
dead," Hamilton pointed out witJ:! 

a nervous laugh. 
Like many other members of 

the UCSF community, Hamilton 
had left early on the day of the 
quake in order to catch Game 3 of 
the World Series on television. 

Dr, Michael Bishop, who was 
sitting in a lower deck box at Can-
dlestick Park, said "the stadium 
was writhing like a snake." 

He added that the crowd's be-
havior wa~ exemplary, especially 
when they began yelling "play balJ" 
minutes after the episode. 

It appears that most of the 

damage on the main campus is 
what Lt. Mark Kurtz called "ex-
actly what you'd expect in a labo-
ratory hit by an earthquake: spilled 
beakers, overturned oxygen tanks, 
broken equipment." 

Steven Wissig's$200,OOOelec-
tron microscope was knocked off 
its stand on the 13 th floor of the 
Science Building. Dr. John Cle-
ments of the CVRI said his cell 
cultures were killed when incuba-
tors were shut off during the power 
outage caused by the quake, and 
will have to be replaced. He said

Free Beer 

TGs and Alcohol 
"TGs are the only real social event at UCSD which includes all 

the students." This is a typical view of TGs, and it is, in some 
ways, valid. 

The Associated Students pay for the free beer, the security and 
the liability for these events. But are they really serving all of the 
students? 

TGs aren't really for everybody, at least not in practice. The 
free beer is ostensibly only for students 21 and older - though 
fake IDs and other sneaky methods of bypas ing this restriction 
are common. But the composition of the crowds at TGs are over-
whelmingly of thi s older age group. 

The chief flaw ofTGs I clear: all of the students are paying for 
them through their student fees, but only a portion of the students 
benefit. It is important to keep having TGs; they do provide a 
social activity for students and the bands are occasionally good. 

But would charging a nominal fee for beer make TG less 
successful or destroy them , as proponents of free beer claim? A

measure which would discontinue the A.S . funding of the beer 
was defeated last year, but the issue needs to be re-examined. Not 
only would charging for beer not hurt TGs, it would very likely 
make them much better. 

The money saved from the cost of the beer could I» used to 
improve the TGs for everyone - by recruiting better bands, for 
example. The money could also be used to finance c heap food , 
such as pizza. 

But there is one problem with the idea of charging for the beer, 
and this lies with the alcohol policy. 

UCSD is supposedly a "dry" campus, but the administration 
allows events such as TGs (and occasional Radically Inclined Ski 
Club events) which carefully walk the line of the alcohol policy. 
Ifhaving social events with alcohol is desirable -and apparently 
it is - shouldn ' t the alcohol policy be re-examined? 

The high cost of following the alcohol policy rules - chief 
among them being the rules regulating the sale of alcohol - puts 
events with alcohol out of reach for all but the wealthiest clubs. 
But there's a real irony in the administration arguing that it is 
advantageous for UCSD to be a dry campus, while the student 
government is financing alcohol at events. 

The tension in these opposing positions has been , to a large 
degree , swept under the rug. An intelligent alcohol policy would 
ensure that events with alcohol are conducted safely , while at the 
same time not be so strict as to unfairly penalize some groups. 

The biggest flaw in the alcohol policy is that it limits the sale 
of alcohol on campus, even to those who are 21. This forces the 
A.S. to make a difficult decision : either have free beer at TGs, or 
don 't have beer at all. 

Many students over 21 want beer at TGs and charging for beer 
would improve the event for the rest of the students, so what the 
A.S . shou ld do is clear: negotiate with the administration to create 
a more balanced and reasonable alcohol policy.

Commentary 

To UCSD Students 
By JOHN RAMIREZ 

Greetings. I hope your first quarter of this 1989-
90 academic year has been both productive and 
enjoyable thus far. As we approach the new decade 
we will be facing some very important decisions 
regarding our finances and our rights. Before I ad-
dress some of these issues, it is important to note that 
your aClive participation has made a major impact on 
some recent decisions. 

The first IS ue dealt with our statewide registra-
tion fees . With an enormou amount of lobbying we 
were able to cut the increase on our registration fees 
from 10% to 3%. When I wentto Sacramento in June 
to speak with the Governor' s office the debale was a 
positive one, but it wa your letters expre sing your 
concerns regarding the proposed increase that were 
the mo t effeclive . 

Your letters (combll1ed with .letters from other 
UC students) were in trumemal in Ihis major vic-
lOry. As you are aware. our registration fees will 
receive adiscounl during Winter and Spring quarter. 
Our fees will be $538 for Winter quarter and $538 for 
Spring. Mishka Migacz (Vice President External 
Affairs), Denise Whisenhunt (UCSA Representa-
tive), Stephanie De La Torre (Lobby Annex Direc-
tor) and myself will work with The University of 
California Student Association (UCSA) in passing 
legislation in the California LegislaTUre to make 
Regislration fees low. 

The next issue was night-time weekend parking.

$15.00. 11te $4.00 figure was reached so that very 
litllc profit would be made from students (the admin-
Istrative costs to make and sell our permit comes to 
just under $4.(0). 

At the same time, most of the Jobs created are 
filled by students. Again, thIS agreement is tempo-

college, an A.S. repre entallve. graduate representa-

We will be attempting to get student discounts from 
vanous emerprises, e.g. the book tore. We will also 
look II1to possibly starting a book re ale program. 
What I am preparing to inlllate IS a resale process 
where we compile a list of the tudents wanting to 
sell : ourse books and givll1g the lI ·t 10 students 
wanting to buy those same books. 

Chances are that you will be able to buy those 
books for a cheaper price than currently sold and the 
seller will probably make more than just a few 
dollars. Again, the success or failure of this project 
will depend on your participation . 

Some other projects include a constitutional

Thursday, October .19, 1989 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

Do you feel there is a viable solution to the 
issue of illegal aliens entering the U.S.? 

I'm tom between the ideological 
and the practical. Ideologically, 
I'd like to see them throw the 
gates open. I know that would 
have a major impact on the 
U.S. economy, but eventually 
an equalibrium could be 
achieved. It would be the most 
compassionate option. 

I feel there's a big problem with 
illegal aliens but I'm not sure if 
there's a solution. 

Put up a wall. That's all. You could put more border 
patrol up, but I don't think they 
would stop coming over here 
unless the situation over there 
got better. 

The length of time or the amount 
of immigrants who are alloweo 
into this country from Mexico 
should be increased. The 
simplest thing would be to jusl 
open up the borders. I don 't see 
why they don't. I have no 
problem with it.

Erratum 
An editorial in the October 16 Guardian reported that UCLA 

students could drop classes through finals week. It failed to note 
that after the 4th week, approval from the student's college is 
needed. The Guardian regrets the error.

Beyond The Fringe: Abortion Wars 
NEW YORK - In Virginia, the first televised 

gubernatorial debate featured Democrat Doug Wi lder 
hammering Republican Marshall Coleman on the 
abortion issue. with Coleman aying to Wilder. 
" Abortion is your only is ue." 

In New Jersey, ads for Democrat James Florio ac-
cuse Republican James Courter of "flip-flopping" 
on the abortion issue, while Courter tells a TV 
audience that he would not impose his personal anti-
abortion views on the pUblic. 

In 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute says. 
barely I percent of those seeking abortions claimed 
to be rape or incest victims - and 95 percent of those 
said other factors besides incest or rape helped lead 
them to choose abortions. 

Now look at the other side: The "pro-life" advo-
cates offer chilling pictures of aborted late-tenn 
fetuses, the better to prove their point about "baby-
killer." Many of the bills now before state legisla-

In Florida, thousands of true 
believers on both sides of the 
issue crowd onto the Capitol 
steps at Tallahassee, while a 
special session of the Legisla-

Jeff Greenfield 
tures insist on testing the "via-
bility" of fetuses more than 20 
or 24 weeks old. 

Universal Press Syndicate Guttmacher's figures show 
that as of 1983, half of I per-
cent of abortions were per-

formed at 21 weeks or more; the percentage of those 
performed after 24 weeks? One-hundredth of 1 per-
cent. 

LUre called at the insistence of anti-abortion Gov. 
Bob Martinez sends his package of abortion restric-
tions down to defeat. 

It's clearthat last July's Supreme Court decision 
permitting states to Iimi: abortions thrust that issue 
onto center stage in statehouses and in local political 
campaigns (even New York City's race for mayor 
was affected when Re-
publican-Liberal Rudy 
Giuliani, personally op-
posed to abortion. had to 
backpedal toward the 
"pro-choice" posture). 

What's the point? Put simply, the most emotion-
ally compelling arguments about abortion have very 
little to do with what is happening. Most women do 
not seek abortions to save thei r lives or to abort a 
rape- or incest-produced pregnancy, but because of 
----------.;..---....;~-- health or economic or 

What's also clear is 
that an awful lot of this 
intense argument is being 
conducted on the fringes 
of the issue. In an effort to 
seize the high political 
ground, both sides of this 

'It's clear 
Supreme

Court decision

emotional reasons, they 
do not wantto bear a child. 

Most women do not 
wait until they have pro-
duced a babylike fetus, but 
make their decision rela-
tively early in pregnancy. 
That makes the issue 
much more metaphysical 
- does life begin at con-
ception? - rather than 

issue have focused an enormous amount of their 
resources on matters that avoid, rather than confront, 
the hard questions. 

medical. (And should the French drug RU-486 ever 
make it to our shores, that will make the gripping 
photographs of the anti-abortion movement far less 
compelling.) For instance, abortion rights advocates constantly 

raise the specter of thousands of deaths from back-
alley abortions in the days before the Supreme Court 
constitutionalized a right to abortion. 

It would be ludicrous to hope for an abortion 
debate that puts aside these essentially irrelevant 
talking points; no movement voluntarily lays down 
its most powerful cudgels. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 

what was the number of deaths from illegal abortions 
in 1972-thelastyearbeforeRoev. Wade? Thiny-
nine. Those are, to be sure, 39 too many, but it hardly 
suggests the kind of slaughter the "pro-choice" 
position paints. 

It's as unlikely as a recognition, from either side, 
that the great majority of the public is deeply troub-
led by the issue; most believe abortion "to be wrong" 
under most circumstances, reject the idea of abortion 
on demand, but even more strongly reject the idea 
that government should tell a woman whether she 
should or should not bear a child. 

Abortion rights advocates also raise the rape and 
incest issue, to argue that abortion foes would insist 
that a woman carry a child to term even if she is 
carrying her rapist's baby. 

In this war, the first casualty my not be truth, but 
ambivalence.

and fear is always there in any 
kind of sexual assault. . . 
There's always some kind of 
control and domination that's 
used to coerce the victim into 
following directions. 

"It's important that people 
not blame the victim. Fear is a 
big motivating factor in 
anyone's life. What happened 
to that woman was not her 
fault," she said. 

Jones said sexually threat-
ening calls to females are com-
mon both at UCSD and in San 
Diego, noting that the UCSD 
Police receive 50 or 60 reports 
of such calls per year. 

"These types of threaten-
ing calls are very common ... 
the thrust of what's going on 
are sexual threats. such as 'if 
you hang up I'm going to rape 
you' and 'I've raped 12 people 
out there at UCSD, and you'll 
be next if you hang up,' "Jones 
said.

AUDITORIUM 

Such calls occur "particu-
larly at UCSD because we have 
a large female popUlation," he 
added. 

However, Jones said that, to 
his knowledge, "We've never 
had a case where the caller actu-
ally followed up on the threats 
as to what they would do if the 
victim hung up." 

Jones said the assault Sun-
day was a "unique situation," 
because the victim did not hang 
up, and was instead lured off 
campus. 

Jones urged anyone at UCSD 
who receives a threatening 
phone call to "hang up, imme-
diately," and call the UCSD 
Police. 

"From our experience ... the 
ideaofthethreats is not to harm 
you, but to keep you on the 
phone," Jones said. 

The investigation of the as-
saUlt, by both the UCSD and 
San Diego Police, is continu-
ing. The UCSD Police Depart-
ment requests that anyone with 
information call the department

It is Saturday evening at the Tij uana River.

Students 
Ride Across 
U.S. to Aid 
Communities 
By AMBER VIERLJNG 
COnJribulinR Wril~r 

In May the Guardian reported 
that five UCSD students were 
"gearing up for a 3,600-mile bike 
ride across America." Last sum-
merallfivecyclists fromUCSD-
Betsy Bluck, Judy FOll , Vicki 
Hand, Joshua Mitnick, and my-
self, Amber Vierling- reached 
ourdestinathn: Washington D.C. 

We rode as the non-profit or-
ganization Bike Aid, also known 
as the Overseas Development 
Network (ODN), (0 raise aware-
ness and money for global issues 
of hunger and poverty. This year 
Bike Aid raised over 597,000 
which will fund community self-
help development projects in the 
United Stales as well as abroad. 

At UCSD the ODN chapter is 
SEED (Students Encouraging 
Education and Development). 'The 
chapters on University campuses 
raise one half of the money needed 
for a project and ODN matches 
that amount. Ellamples of grass-
roots coverage include providing 
funds to start a sewing co-opera-
tive in Bolivia or providing funds 
for nutritional information for ex-
pectant mothers in Harlan. Ken-
tucky and training and educating 
the local residents as nurses . 

In addition to raising money 
for hunger and poverty issues, Bike 
Aid also gave many pres~ntations 
to groups en route and worked in 
various community projects. We 
talked to all ages of people from 
schoolchildren to veterans of 
World War n about the hows, 
whats and whys of our ride. We 
worked in a variety of community 
projects ranging from homeless 
shelters and food banks in AI-
buquelque, New Mexico to re-
pairing individuals' deteriorating 
"houses" in the poorer regions of 
the Appalachian Mountains. 

Sixty-one riders left from four 
different locations-- Seattle, San 
Francisco, and Los Angeles on 
lune 17, 1989 and Austin, Texas 
on July 17. All routes converged 
in Washington, D.C. on August 
17. Betsy and I rode on the Los 
Aiig"les route, while Judy, Vicki, 
and Joshua rode the Austin route. 
We averaged 72 miles a day for 
nine weeks across many teJTains-
across the Mojave Desert, up the 
Rocky Mountains, through the 
Great Plains and over the Appala-
chians. 

We had a pick-up truck as 
support to cany food, water, bag-
gage and educational malerials. 
We slept in many high school 
gyms. churches, armories, home-
less shelters and occasionally, 
sympathetic people's homes with 
nice warm showers. 

As one rider put it,. "Bike Aid 
is a way of living for a summer, 
and a way of thinking for a life-
time." 

SEED meets on ThurSday 
nights in the Student Center room

Mauro Ties Dulock's Scoring Record 

Tritons Back At It Again 
By JOHN ASUNCION 

Contributing Writer 

UCSD's version of the Pacific Sock 
Exchange (a.k.a. Heather Mauro and Felicia 
Faro), raised the women's soccer team's 
scoring stock seven points in a blanking of 
Cal Lutheran yesterday at UCSD's home 
office. 

Faro nailed three goals and one assist in 
the 7-0 crashing, while Mauro added two 
goals and an assist by game's closing. 

Mauro's two goals allowed her to tie the 
UCSD single-season scoring record of 21, 
set by sophomore forward Katy Dulock in 
her first campaign last year. 

goals in a 51-second span midway through 
the first half. Faro initiated the scoring at 
18:43 on an assist from Dulock. Shortly 
thereafter, Dulock bought into the action at 
19:34 with an assist to senior midfielder 
Sheila Takahashi. 

"In the second half we began to senle 
down, and our fitness began to payoff," 
McManus explained after the Tritons posted 
five insurance goals. 

Both Mauro and Faro tallied two goals 
and an assisl in the second half to put the 
game away and extend their team-leading 
scoring totals 10 47 and 37 points, respec-
tively. 

Faro's first goal in the second half came 
on a penalty kick, and the other found the net 
after traveling 30 yards from the comer.

UCSD began the bidding in a sluggish 
manner, which was a result of either 
Sunday's loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
- the first of the year - or sore legs, 
according to Head Coach Brian McManus. 

However, UCSD soon exploded for two 

Mauro's second goal symbolized the 
Triton win. Her initial shot hit the goalpost, 
but she followed the ricochet and the Regal

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS ... Both national powerhouses, both

other from (cough, choke) Los Angeles. One a defending 
national champion, the other, well, the other. I'll admit I 
haven't really been following these teams this season - in 
fact, {haven't really been following college football at all 
because the commercialization and hypocrisy of it all 
makes me sick. But there's one thing I do know: USC is 
not going to win this game. Why? I think you can figure

TAKE NOTRE DAME 

Letters to the Sports Section 
The Football 
Issue Rehashed? 
OhNo! 

Here we go again. 
Every year, as if it were an 

annual tradition, someone brings 
up the football issue. David 
Poticha's sports commentary in 
the Thursday, Oct. 12 issue of the 
Guardian is continuing this tradi-
tion. 

Poticha claims that UCSD 
needs a football team for two basic 
reasons. One is to foster "school 
spirit" and "togetherness." The 
other is to obtain further recogni-
tion for the campus outside of the 
local area. These are noble aims, 
but is Poticha going to pay for it? 

The only way UCSD wiltget a 
football team is if the student body 
agrees to a fee increase. Now, I 
don't know about Poticha, but 
nearly $600 a quarter is enough 
forme! 

I suppose if one wasn't paying 
one's fees with one's own money, 
then the financial aspect of the 
football issue wouldn't matter. 
The fact is that the cost of a foot-
ball team would not be cheap. It 's 
surprising that Poticha makes no 

mention of cost. Yet, if daddy is 
paying for school anyway, then 
who cares if our fees go up $50 or 
$60 a quarter? I do! 

One reason why the football 
initiatives failed in the past was 
simply because of the cost. Most 
students are not rich. The addi-
tional cost of a football team 
would be an expensive lUXUry. 

Having luxuries is not wrong 
- that's why sports do exist on 
campus - but an expensive frill 
like football is a bit too much. 
Football would gobble up huge 
sums of money for stan-up costs, 
ongoing costs to pay for coaches, 
and the like. 

I agree that school spirit needs 
some work and that maybe people 
in Arkansas need to know there is 
such a thing as UCSD. Football, 
though, is not the miracle pana-
cea. A Division m team would 
create some school spirit and 
make our school a little better 
known in California, but the costs 
are 100 great. 

This isn't high school where 
the district pays for everything. 
Here, we, the students, foot the 
bill for nearly everything. Maybe 
if the UC Regents could part with 
some of their fortune for a team at 
UCSD, then the idea would be a 

more reasonable one. 
Asking the student body to pay 

for an expensive project like foot-
ball is a bit too much. If the money 
was all coming out of Poticha's 
pocket, then he would realize this.

I'm Getting Sick 
Of Phil's Bay 
Area Biased Picks 
Editor: 

You know; I'm really getting 
sick and tired of picking up our 
school newspaper, getting to the 
sports section and reading the 
"Bay Area Sports Watch," by Phil 
"I'm going to pick the Bay Area 
team" Gruen. 

I can't remember the last time 
I read Phil's idiotic sports predic-
tion when he wasn't either bag-
ging on an L.A. team (seetoday's 
pick) or making a prediction for 
an S.F. team. Is it really neces-
sary? 

Phil obviously is very insecure 
when it comes to teams from 
Southern California either because 
they have consistently beaten up 
on the Bay Area teams in the past

or maybe because the Bay Area 
teams like it in L.A. SO much that 
they want to move down here. 

Before coming to UCSD, I re-
ally didn't dislike any of the teams 
from the Bay Area. But after hav-
ing to read Phil's shit for the past 
few years I've really grown to 
dislike the 4gers, A's, Giants, and 
Warriors. 

Phil doesn't even give credit 
where credit is due. For example, 
last year's World Series Champi-
ons, the Los Angeles Dodgers, not 
only played like true champs, but 
they beat the odds-playing with-
out key players as well as with 
injured ones. 

They deserved to be the World 
Champions after the way they 
played, but not once did Phil give 
them credit for their perfonnance .. 
All he could do was act like a little 
boy, making comments such as 
how lucky hey were, how they 
didn't deserve to be there, how the 
Mets or A's were going to destroy 
them, and how it wasn't going to 
be close . 

Even after the Dodgel s spanked 
the A's there wasn't a word of con-
gratulations from Mr. Gruen. A 
true sports critic would have eaten 
his words like a man.

The shutout was the Tritons' 

twelfth in 13 games, and sets goalie 
Julie Freiss out on a new scoreless 
streak. Her school record of I I 
consecutive shutouts was snapped 
when Dominguez Hills managed 
to score the only goal the stingy 
Triton defense has allowed all sea-
son. UCSD has now outscored its 
opponeOls 62-1.

Phil ,I'm a Rams fan and I rooted 
against the4gers in the Super Bowl, 
but regardless of my hate for the 
Niners at least I give credit where 
credit is due. 

The Niners played like champi-
ons and deserved to be the World 
Champions, and as much as I dis-
like Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and 
Ronnie Lott, I have to admit that 
they are three of the best in the 
game today. 

Phil , you are obviously not a 
true sportsman, but rather one of 
those fans who would hop the left 
field fence at Candlestick and throw 
batteries at Kirk Gibson. 

And honestly, Phil, do you re-
ally find it exciting to watch the 
two teams you like most play in a 
championship game? 

An exciting series involves 
watching your team play the team 
you hate most. I think 1'd rather be 
watching a series where I can sit 
there and root for my team to win, 
rather than sitting on the couch 
thinking, " [ really don't care who 
wins. I like both teams." 

How else can you appreciate it 
when your team makes a spectacu-
lar play to either win the game in 
the ninth, or get you out of a jam for 
the third out. Now that 's exciting! 

Grow up, Phil.

UCSD Intramural Sports contin-
ued its consistenrtrend of the past 
decade with another record turnout 
at the turnstiles this quarter as 63 
new teams registered for intramural 
action. The quarterly total of 5n 
intramural sports teams in 7 team 
sports activities represents a 12.2 
percent increase over the same 
period in 1988. 

In addition, a record total of 57 
teams are now currently on 1M Sports 
waiting to play lists, further evidenc-
ing the popularity of the program 
among students, lacutty, and staff of 
the university. 

Wrth the additional support of the 
North Campus Recreation Area 
fields, participation in 1M field sport 
activities has grown significantly. 
Rag football , a sport thai had re-
gressed in team participation in rec-
ent years, has rebounded to previ-
ous levels of participation. 1M offi-
cials suspect that the new field availa-
bility and the overall quality of the 
lields were at least two significant 
reasons for the rebound. 

Additionally, the sport of Over-
The-Line, long popular on San 
Diego's beaches during the summer 
months. made its campus debut this 
quarter with a much-more-than-
expected 24 teams registering for 
play. Over-The-Une curren~ytakes 

place on Pryatel field near the War-
ren campus, and was made avail-
able to the campus population be-
cause ofthe construction olthe North 
Campus fields. 
On the indoor front, the sports at 
volleyball , waterpolo, and floor 
hockey continued their consistent 
growth patterns with 7,8, and 12 
percentage point gains. With 
UCSD indoor space at a premium, 
these sports bumped themselves 
into some strange new time 
frames (i.e. 12:15am to 
1 :OOam) and surprisingly had stu-
dent teams climbing allover each 
other trying to get in and play. 

Team Tennis, a four-person coed 
sport, that has really taken off in 
the last three years, continues 
to be the fastest growing 1M sport 
at UCSD during fall quarter with a 
14.2 percent increase and 
plenty of teams on the waiting list 
ready to play. 

All in all, 1M officials expect this 
healthy tradition to continue in the 
quarters ahead, as the university 
grows and as more and more stu-
dents enterthe university with sotid 
competitive sports backgrounds 
in a variety of activities.

t's tough to think ot any game this early 

in the season being a 'big' game, but we 
have severat games on tap this coming

GAME TiME ' IoriliJIf 7"~ 

The 13 ranked RAFTERS enter to-
nights game with an undefeated record 
and featlKe a one dimensional offense 
that has logged 31 points so far this sea-
SOIl. They have also given ~ 11 goals 
which has been a. concern of caplain 
David Lawrence. On oIIense the RAF· 
TERS rely heavily on Nicole House who 
has taled.24 of the teams 31 points. 
Rnding more scoring sources may be a 
key for the RAFTERS it they want to 
COrl1l8te against the league's best. You 
can't argue with success though, and 
until someone really gets in Nicole's tube 
and shuts her down this squad may not 
be baa!en. 

On the other $Ide ot the pool is a group 
of cagy veterans who are enjoying their 
most successful season to date. TEAM 
169 hits the pooIlonight with a pIIIfect 2-
o record and like their opponents they 
have scored 31 points tIllS far, but they 
have given ~ a total of 15. The big gun 
tor this squad is Kim HoWllld, who Jeads 
the team with 14 points. Captain Don 
O'neilk8eps HowanI at the offensive end 
which always draws defensive pteSSUre 
from opponents. This has allowed lor a 
more balanced scoring attack as to otten 
other players have been left open by 
defenses concentrating on Howard. The 
key for this crew is i~ng the iabiities of 
their swiss cheese defense. 

This game could develop into a real 
bailie betwen two of tWt-pofo's pre-
mier SCOf8fS. ff either team gets smart 
(and their are no indications that will take 
place) and smothers House or How8ld it 
will be up to the rest of the squad 10 pick

Neil Simon's Comedy 
Bounds Back 

From 
Broadway 
By Michael Schwartz 

Hiatus Intern 

Everything's being made into movies these days. It's hard to tell what 
is an original story and what has been adapted from a book or play. Often, 
however, the movie doesn't live up to the original form _ Neil Simon's 
"Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Biloxi Blues" were mildly successful 
films, but were smashes on Broadway_ The last comedy in Simon's auto-
biographical trilogy, "Broadway Bound," has just arrived for its San 

• Diego debut at the North Coast Repertory Theatre, 
If America was to have a national playwright, it would undoubtedly 
be Simon. Nobody else has the ability to combine hysterical one-

liners with realistic drama. Simon has focused more on the latter 
in "Broadway Bound," and he makes us realize that not every-

thing in life is tied up into a neat, packaged ending. 
The year is 1949, and things are not going well in the 

Jerome household. While Eugene and his brother, Stanley, 
are breaking into comedy, his parents are breaking up. The 

mother of the family, Kate, feels com~ulsive about taking 
of everyone from her parents to her children, but for-

gets about herself, 
Difficult questions are posed_ Should we take care 

of others if they don't want it? Are 37 years of 
marriage enough reason to stay together if two 

people don't love each other? As in real life, most 
of these questions remain unanswered.

Beautiful Women Compromise 
Image For Success 

This week's topic is the proverbial "bimbo." This character type, featured widely in the media, is the epit-
ome of the "I'm a fragile girl who has really large mammary glands. Don't get sharp objects too close to my 
head, it may pop." 

The other night, I saw a new Budweiser commercial. This one was even worse than those 'Spuds' com-
mercials ... you know, the ones where all of the women bounce around Spuds in bikinis. 

Anyway, this new ad features a few guys who are creating their dream bar. They spray a can and a bar 
pops into view, and so on. At the very end, the guys dump a bucket's contents onto the ground, and a slew 
of vivacious vamps appear out af a veil of smoke. 

Now, it is really nice to imagine that these women were brought forth out of bucket sludge, but that's 
another story. If you"ve seen the commercial, you know my complaint about the women. 

Another "bimbo" is Kim Basinger in the over-hyPed film "Batman." Her main function in the movie was 
to be a Barbie doll, changing outfits and hairstyles every two minutes. She did always look good, which I guess 
was the point. 

Basinger's other actions mainly consisted of screeching every time she was in danger. The woman never 
shut up. She was so helpless. It was a perfect set-upto make Batman look like a God, but it was pretty nauseating 
just the same. 

The music business has such fine examples of musical talent as Tiffany, Debbie Gibson and Samantha Fox. 
Although Tiffany is too young to vamp and Gibson is too wholesome, Fox definitely lives up to her name. 

Ignoring the fact that Fox couldn't sing on-key during a live performance if God himself were her voice 
coach, her sole claim to fame was her stint as a British "Page 3" girl. (Featured in some British newspapers. 
"Page )" girls are models who pose topless for a full spread on page 3.) 

A memorable scene was Fox's performance on the Arsenio Hall show earlier this year. As she flounced 
abom on stage, black-leather body suit stretched over her ample proportions. her gyrations caused the metal 
chain outer-bra and g-string to shimmy. to the obvious enjoyment of Hall. 

When Hall questioned Fox sbout her interesting outfit. she replied the "best things in life are often 
uncomfortable." Call me strange, but if I was wearing something that both made me look like a bovine and 
was physically painful, I would change. 

It is pitiful that some women feel that in order to attain quick success in the entertainment business. they 
must succumb to the pressure of portraying a "sexy, yet helpless" image. Unfortunately, this technique often 
works.

Confronting The Effects 
Of Being 'In Country' 

By Joceliza Gonzaga 
Hiatus Intern 

For lack of information about "In Country," I went to watch the 
movie with no expectations and on ly slight doubts about Bruce Willis' 
ability to portray a dramatic character. I left the theater with mixed 
emotions. disappointment tipping the scales. 

"In country" is a phrase that most Vietnam veterans use to describe 
being in the jungle during the Vietnam conflict. It was a catch-phrase 
that young men made up to distinguish the nightmare from their reality, 
America. Ironically, upon their return to the United States. their minds 
remaineo "in country," while they faced a psychological batrle inAmer-
ica. 

The movie is based on the book with the same tirle written by Bobbie 
Ann Mason. It depicts a teen-aged girl. Samantha (played by Emily 
Lloyd), trying to understand and cope with the bitter anguish that the 
war had inflicted on her family. Her drive to learn more about her father. 
who had died "in country" without ever seeing his daughter. leads Sam 
to confront her elders. 

Throughout the story. she forces her grandparents, mother and uncle 
to share with her their accounts of the time. In one dinner scene with 
Mamaw and Grampaw. played by Peggy Rae and Richard Hamilton, 
Sam asks why they had never visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
in Washington. D.C. They replied that it is too painful and, for Mamaw 
who had never left the county, too far. 

This honest portrayal of families of Vietnam vets is a fresh approach 
and unexplored aspect of a war that ravaged a whole society. The movie 
also gives the responsibility of learning about the war to the younger 
generations, those of us who have not been called to fight battles. "In 
Country" is beckoning the youths of today to clean the wounds that 
their parents bear and to allow them to heal properly. 

"In Country" is a noble attempt to catch Mason's book in a different

Rourke Goes Under The Knife In 
'Johnny H~dsome' 

By James Darlow 
Hiatus Intern 

"Johnny Handsome," the latest film from Walter Hill, director of "48 HRS." and co-producer of 
"Alien,· is quite a departure from box-office favorites. In "Johnny Handsome." Hill has created a shock-
ing film about revenge. He takes a character with a rare genetic disease and creates an angry ex-criminal 
out of him who is bent on gaining revenge for the merciless killing of his only real friend. 

Mickey Rourke is Johnny Handsome (John Sedley). a master criminal who meticulously plans crimes. 
Scott Wilson, in a small part, is johnny's only friend, Mikey. Ellen Barkin ("Sea of Love") and Lance 
Henricksen ("Aliens") are Sunny and Rafe, two viciously deceitful criminals. Elizabeth McGovern ("She's 
Havinga Baby"). Forest Whitaker{"Good Morning Vietnam"). and Morgan Freeman ("Leanon Me") also 
star. 

The plot of the film centers around Handsome's desire to gain revenge for the murder of his best friend 
Mikey during a heist at a rare coin shop in New Orleans. Handsome was born with the rare genetic disease 
elephantiasis. hence the cruel nickname. In order to escape ridicule, Handsome resorts to a life of crime. 

It is while he is in prison that he meets up with Milc.ey and they become good friends. Once outside. 
they return to a life of crime. 

In order to pull off the biggest crime of their lives, Handsome and Mikey employ the help of two ruthless 
characters. Sunny and Rafe. While they are pulling off the heist, Mikey and another accomplice are killed. 
while Handsome escapes unscathed. 

While serving time in Angola Prison, Handsome is given the chance to be rehabilitated by Dr. Resher, 
played by Forest Whitaker. This is all based on Dr. Resher's presumption that Handsome's abnormal 
features are behind his criminal actions and that rehabilitation would change him. 

Handsome agrees to go under the len ife and endures the slow process of becoming a "new" person. After 
a vt:ry brief rehabilitation period, he is given a new identity with a decent job in a New Orleans shipyard. 

The only problem with the film is that it asb the audience to believe the time it talces for Handsome 
to undergo reconstructive surgery is less dum six months. In other words, Handsome goes from being a 
phyaicaUydefonned criminal with a serious speech impediment (oa handsome shipyard worker in less than 
half a year, If this is to be believed in the storyline of the film it must be more realistic and plaUSible. 

!be beat part about "Johnny Handsome" is twa-fold. Both the acting and the technical aspects of the 
film make it entertaining to watch. 

Mickey Rourke does an excellent job portraying the erotaquely defonned Johnny Handsome as a 
human being. and not a. monster. Rourke is able to present, hidden behind his facial and speech impedi-
ments. a ~ yearning for basic human compassion. 

Both Ellen Barkin and Lance Henricksen portray Sunny and Rafe as two of the most despicable 
criminals seen in feature Alma since the villains in "Lethal Weapon 2." Forest Whitaker and Morgan

unique. The first, "The Uncer. 
tainty of the Poet ," had a strange 
machine-like melodic line reflect· 
ing the body of the text: "I like ba-
nanas, I am a poet; I am bananas, I 
like a poet ... " The next piece, 
"Rodin's Muse," was one of seri-
ous, dark and hauntingdissonance, 
perhaps reflecting the mood of the 
art itself. 

Last Tuesday evening brought 
polyphonic elegance and exper-
tise to the MandevilleAuditorium. 
Chanticleer, the San Francisco-
based , all-male a capella vocal 
ensemble, performed an impres-
sive and varied program of reper-
toire spanning 400 years of popu-
lar songs, each displaying a rhyth-
mic precision and a soaring har-
monic blend. 

The eight voices never ex-
ceeded a moderate dynamic level, 
creating a lilting and ethereal 
blend. The smooth swells and the 
phrasing of the lines proved quite 
mesmerizing at times. 

Of course, a men's a capella 
group would not be complete with-
out a "good old boys" sampling of 
barbershop tunes. Here, the pre-
cise timing, the constantly ener-
getic, moving forward line and 
blend were quite enviable. How-
ever, the group seemed a bit too 
polished and artistic for the mate-
rial and more pedestrian style that 
barbershop implies. 

Chanticleer: 1988-89 Season 

The concert was divided into 
seven sections, each providing a 
sampling of a particular genre of 
vocal music. Chanticleer opened 
with selections of 16th century 
sacred music and went on [0 per-

Perhaps the most interesting 
section was the one entitled "With 
a Poet's Eye." This included five 
pieces commissioned and com-
posed for the group. The songs 
were all.settings of original poems 
that had won a competition spon-
sored by the Tate Gallery for best 
capturing the work of specific 
famous artists. 

Each song was both textually 
and harmonically original and 

The singers went on to the 
modem "The Lark and the Night-
ingale," a moody ballad combin-
ing the calm of a gentle lark with 
the chaotic violence of a ship-
wreck. This contrast was deftly 
delivered vocally by combining a 
sweet fluid line with a driving, 
tormented urgency. One could 
really sense the calm before and

Next was a soulful arrangement 

of "0 Waly, Waly" featuring a 
countertenor soloist who sailed 
effortlessly clear above the treble 
staff, wrought with dramatic in-
flection and passionate phrasing. 

The last set included 20th cen-
tury popular tunes beginning with 
a lively and harmonically tight 
"Out of This World" and ending 
with a great crowd pleaser, Cole 
Porter's "Let's Do It." The singers 
encored with a gende and moving 
rendition of "Down by the Salley

A Ithough Chanticleer has been 
compared to England's famed 
King's Singers, the groups are quite 
different. This is primarily due to 
the focus the higher voices com-
mand in the American group -
particularly the strong and clear 

·countertenors. The English group 
seems much more grounded in the 
baritone range. 

I recommend catchingChanti-
cleer next time around. This group 
provides a most enchanting eve· 
ningofaesthetically beautiful song. 
The singers can be next heard in

Handsome 
Co;tinued from page 3 

Freeman are excellently cast as Dr. 
Resher and Lt. Drones, as they 
bring a sense of caring for Hand-
some, although they show it in 
very different ways. Unfortunately, 
Elizabeth McGovern's Donna is 
seriously overlooked in the script, 
thereby effectively eliminating 
Johnny's only link to the real world 
outside of crime and his chances of 
starting his life over again. 

Undoubtedly the mosr inter-
esting aspects of his lie are the 
technical wizardry that exist 
throughout the story. &th Dr. 
Lillian Glass, speech and voice 
consultant to Rourke, and Zoltan 
Elek, special make-up artist, de-
serve praise for their collective 
abilities to create a very believable 
character. 

Overall "Johnny Handsome" is 
a very good film. It has irs slow 
parts and inconsistencies, but it is 
also action packed (almost too 
violent at the end) and, ar times. 
humorous. Walter Hill states that 
the film is not only about revenge, 
but also "redemption, love, fate 
and circumstances." All of this 

make.~ for an excellent film and a 
very surprising ending.

Bound 
Continued from page 1 

If this is beginning to sound a 
little like "thirtysomething" rather 
than a comedy, don' t despair. Eu-
gene Morris Jerome still spews out 
enough jokes to keep several shows 
going. The scenes with Eugene 
and Stanley experiencing severe 
writer's block are nothing short of 
hysterical. 

Paul Epstein, as Eugene, cap-
tures perfectly the confusion of a 
person on the brink of "the real 
world," something to which we 
can all relate. Although Epstein 
tends to fall into the groove of de-
livering all of his lines with the 
same deadpan expression, his tim-
ing is immaculate. Dan Wingard is 
enjoyable as Stanley, playing him 
in a comic, larger-than-life form. 

Robert Morgan is simply won-
derful as Ben, the Socialist grand-
father who thinks comedy should 
be about Trotsky, not Coney Is-
land. DeborahJerd makes the most 
of her one scene as Blanche. 

As Jack, the husband experi-
encing a belated midlife crisis, 
William Quiett fails to fully grasp 
his character. He acts more like 
he's going on a trip to the zoo than 
leaving the only life he's ever re-
ally known. Unfortunately, San-
dra Ellis-Troy is miscast as Kate, 
the dedicated mother. Although 
she gives an excellent perform-
ance, she isn't able to capture the 
endless jewish nagging that the 
other characters can not stand. 

The direction by Olive Blaki-
stone is clean, and he finds the 
perfect blend between humor and 
drama . Apparently, however, 
Blakistone never decided whether 
the San Diegan cast shou Id put on 
Brooklyn accents. While Stan and 
Eugene speak in perfect period 
speech, their parents have no ac-
Cent whatsoever. Both ways work 
but the cast should agree on one 
type or the other. 

For a non-professional show, 
North Coast provides excellent 
technical features . The costumes 
fit the mood of the era and the 
lighting works nicely. The set, 
although sparsely furnished , fits 
perfectly into the small theatre. 
One highlight of the production is 
the radio program produced by 
Gary Seger. It's easy to forget that 
the clips from the comedy show 
are new and not actually from the 
period. 

Despite some flaws, the pro-
duction is wonderful. There's 
something for everyone to identify 
with, and the story leaves us yearn-
ing for more. Like its predecessors, 
this episode in the trilogy will un-
doubtedly hit the big screen any 
day now. Yet, for just a few more 
dollars than a movie, this show is 
worth seeing where it was meant 
to be seen: in the theatre. 

"Broadway Bound" runs Thurs-
day-Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sun-
days at 7 p.m. Tickets are $10-12.

The Classic Nude 
With A Twist 

By Wende Bischoff 
Hiatus Intern 
Do you appreciate nudity? If 

you do, Brushworks Gallery has 
put on a show to rem ind the public 
that Playboy does not have a 
monopoly on the nude. The sec-
ond annual nude show, entitled 
"The Nak'd and the Nude." fea-
tures paintings. sculpture and 
photography created by 17 local 
artists. 

Members of the gallery chose 
this playful title to highlight the 
perpetual controversy between art. 
erotica and pornography. The 
works, by no means obscene or 
shocking. repre ent the essence of 
the human form in varied styles. 
ranging from classic nude studies 
to lighthearted and comical por-
trayals of rotund hedonistic 
women. 

Managers of the gallery feel that 
basic art study of the nude is un-
derrepresented in San Diego. and 
therefore have assembled unique 
pieces, revealing excellent talent 
and amusing the viewer with their 
original ity. 

Contrary to my expectations. a 
large painting of a nude was not 
what first caught my attention 

when I arrived. It was bright colors 
of Phillip Dvorak's pastels. The 
pastels he uses are so bright and 
densely layered, they luminate a 
rich, vibrating texture. giving the 
tactile illusion of velour. 

Although nudes were not the 
central image of his works, his 
simple, bold strokes reveal a defi-
nite command of the human fig-
ure. I was honestly captivated by 
the beauty of these pieces, not 
moving to see the more explicit 
nudity for some time. 

The next set of artists I sawall 
seemed to have an innate sense of 
the possibility of comedy in nudity 
and the human condition . First, 
there is Cheryl O'Neil's five acryl-
ics, which, I discovered, are a par-
ody ofManet'scontroversial nine-
teenthcenturypainting, TheOlym-
pia. These versions play on last 
century's controversy of represent-
ing lower social classes and prosti-
tution in art, by portraying such 
present day horrors such as stalk-
ing robots and horny dogs attack-
ing the bed. 

John Demarco shows his wit by 
portraying a naked figure as a sur-
realistic guitar on the lapofaseated 
man in his work entitled, "Guitar 

Player with His Main Squeeze." 
These and a few other lighl-

hearted pieces are examples of 
nudity without the sex with which 
it is so often a sociated. 

On the more serious ide are 
many classic nude studies. includ-
ing those of the most acclaimed 
artist represented,Jean Swiggett. a 
veteran of over four hundred shows 
His pencil drawings of male and 
female nudes are precise and 
simple, anatomical in nature. 

This show, not too long an 
free of cost, was excellent. Th 
show will be featured until Nov. 
18. The Brushworks Gallery i 
located at 425 Market Street. San 
Diego.
