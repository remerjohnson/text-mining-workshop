Union Battle Drags On Despite Midsummer Strike

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

Nearly a year into negotia-
tions for a new labor contract, the 
University of California’s 8,500 ser-
vice workers held a five-day strike 
this summer that elucidated grow-
ing concerns regarding pay equity 
and benefits.

From July 14 to 18, thousands 
of these workers — represented by 
the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
— picketed at nine of the universi-
ty’s 10 campuses, demanding a $15 
minimum wage and a step system to 
standardize raises. 

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said that 
enough employees arrived at work 
to maintain normal operations of 
all university facilities, but that 
some employees and patients at the 
university’s medical centers com-
plained about the noise produced by 
demonstrators.

The strike took place in spite 
of a temporary restraining order 
issued by the Superior Court of San 
Francisco on July 11 that prohib-
ited it. According to AFSCME Local See STRIKE, page 10

Claiming to have witnessed 
unfair admissions practices that dis-
regard state laws prohibiting racial 
preference in applicant selection, 
UCLA professor Tim Groseclose 
resigned from his post last month 
after releasing an 89-page report 
detailing his 
reasons for sus-
picion.

The political 
science profes-
sor  resigned 
on Aug. 28 
from UCLA’s 
Committee on 
Undergraduate 
Admissions and 
Relations with 
Schools, stating that “a growing 
body of evidence strongly suggests 
that UCLA is cheating on admis-
sions.”

The former faculty member 
attributed much of his initial sus-
picion of internal misconduct to 
the generally negative attitudes that 
he claims to have observed among 
colleagues toward Proposition 209, 
a 1996 voter initiative that bars 
California’s public universities 
from considering factors such as 
race and religion in the admissions 
process. 

“Many people at UCLA look 
at Prop. 209 as an unjust law that 
should be violated,” Groseclose said. 
“That is the main position taken by 
most of the faculty, so everyone 
suspected a little bit of mischief in 
the admissions process.”

Groseclose’s suspicion grew 
upon the campus’ implementa-
tion of a new holistic admissions 
process that places more emphasis 
on an applicant’s personal back-
ground and character as compared 
to UCLA’s previous point-based 
system.

Groseclose believes that under 
the new system, minority appli-
cants who self-report their racial 
backgrounds within their personal 
statements are more likely to be 
viewed as preferred candidates dur-
ing the admissions process. 

Groseclose views this alleged 
racial preference as unjustly assist-
ing a particular subset of the great-
er minority population. 

“We must help all minority stu-
dents, and not just those who know 
to reveal their racial backgrounds 
in their applications,” he said.

COVER-UP 

By Justin Gutierrez

Responding to Hurricanes 
Gustav and Ike, prestationed disas-
ter teams from across the nation, 
including several volunteers from 
the UCSD Medical Center, flocked 
to the affected areas early this 
month to assist with emergency 
relief efforts thoughtout the region.

Disaster Medical Assistance 
Team San Diego, staffed by mem-
bers of the Hillcrest-based medi-
cal center, lent their expertise to 
aid victims in Louisiana and else-
where in the nation’s disaster-rid-
den southeastern region.

“DMATs are stationed all 
throughout the country,” said 
DMAT San Diego Commander Dr. 
Jake Jacoby, a member of the UCSD 
Medical Center. “When city, county 
and state disaster needs cannot be 
met, the federal government will

dispatch teams like ours to the area 
in need.”

Jacoby said the disaster teams 
were prestationed in cities such 
as Baton Rouge and Atlanta, 
where they awaited dispatch to 
areas throughout the southeastern 
United States.

Jacoby, like many other mem-
bers of the team from UCSD, has 
prior experience in disaster situa-
tions. He, as well as the recent trip’s 
Operations Chief Thérèse Rymer, 

both assisted during the Hurricane 
Katrina relief effort in 2005.

Although the volunteers often 
apply their previous relief-effort 
experiences to the next disaster, 
specific circumstances can never 
be predicted.

“There is no real way to com-
pare,” Rymer said. “Each situation 
is different — we expect the unex-
pected.”

The U.S. Department of Defense 
has awarded the UCSD School of 
Medicine the leadership role in a 
10-site, five-year clinical consor-
tium that will focus on gaining a 
greater understanding of post-trau-
matic stress disorder and traumatic 
brain injuries — disorders that have 
been appearing with alarming fre-
quency lately, especially in military 
personnel who have participated 
in the current conflicts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 

The consortium has been alot-
ted $60 million out of $300 million 
set aside by Congress to address the 
issue of PTSD and TBI, as well as 
any possible links between the two.

Center, spent two weeks providing aid to devestated areas in the southeastern United States.

the country’s hurricane-

3299 President Lakesha Harrison, 
the court order — which came at 
the university’s request — simply 
required that the union provide 
prior warning of strike activities, and 
AFSCME had already announced its 
strike schedule the previous day.

“We gave notice before the rul-
ing even came out,” she said.

State Sen. Leland Yee (D-San 
Francisco/San Mateo) agreed that 
the union had provided adequate 
warning of the strike, and he sub-
mitted a letter to UC President 
Mark Yudof on July 15 demanding 
that the university stop threatening 
its employees.

“If even one worker is retaliated 
against or disciplined for exercising 
their right to strike, I will do every-
thing in my power to appropriately 
respond to the university,” he said in 
a statement.

Harrison said service work-
ers are the lowest-paid in the UC 
system, adding that longstanding 
employees receive no reward for 
their extended service.

“Right now we have people who 
have worked 30 years and people who 
have worked two years who make the 
same amount of money,” she said.

In addition to AFSCME’s service 
worker contract negotiations, which 
began last October, the union has 
bargained for a contract for the uni-
versity’s 11,000 patient-care techni-
cal workers since August 2007.

‘Cargo Ships’ Target 
Cancerous Tumors

Researchers at UCSD, UC Santa 
Barbara and MIT have reported 
the development of a “cargo-ship” 
mechanism aimed to target cancer-
ous tumors and destroy them dur-
ing the early stages of growth while 
also circumventing removal by the 
immune system. 

Michael Sailor, a professor of 
chemistry and biochemistry at UCSD 
who headed the team of chemists, 
biologists and engineers responsible 
for creating the capsules, describes 
the new technology as protective 
“mother ships” containing drugs that 
would usually be destroyed by natu-
ral bodily processes. 

Fastened to the capsules is F3, a 
protein that attaches itself to cancer-
ous cells in order to target tumors 
with greater accuracy. Researchers 
hope these capsules will lead to 
devices that can one day deliver 
large concentrations of anti-cancer 
drugs to tumors without being acci-
dentally released to other non-malig-
nant parts of the body, an obstacle 
that continues to challenge cancer 
researchers. The hull of the capsule 
has been constructed from a strong 
enough material to prevent this toxic 
anti-cancer material from being 
released into the bloodstream.

The “cargo-ships” are also loaded 
with iron oxide nanoparticles, which 
will improve the diagnostic imaging 
of cancerous tumors in magnetic res-
onance imaging scans. Sailor hopes 
that better image quality will lead to 
earlier detection of small tumors that 
would usually go unnoticed, thus 
allowing them to be treated before 
they spread any further. 

“One can imagine a surgeon iden-
tifying the specific location of a tumor 
in the body before surgery with an 
MRI scan, then using fluorescence 
imaging to find and remove all parts 
of the tumor during the operation,” 
Sailor said.

Berkeley Launches $3-
Billion Funds Campaign

UC Berkeley announced a cam-
paign plan last week to raise $3 bil-
lion in donations by 2013.  

Calling on alumni, parents and 
friends of the university to contribute, 
the “quiet phase” of the Campaign 
for Berkeley, which began June 30, 
has already raised more than $1.3 
billion in donations and pledges. 

The announcement accompanies 
the end of a record-breaking fund-
raising year for the university, which 
acquired over $409.3 million in gifts 
and donations.

The funds will be used to attract 
and maintain top faculty, expand stu-
dent scholarship opportunities and 
support research ventures. 

The funds will also allow Berkeley 
to close the funding gap that exists 
between itself and first-rate private 
schools with much larger annual 
endowments and alumni donations. 

“The Campaign for Berkeley calls 
upon every member of the Cal fam-
ily to stand together to renew and 
extend UC Berkeley’s academic 
pre-eminence and global leader-
ship,” Berkeley Chancellor Robert 
J. Birgeneau said in a statement. 
“Grand aspirations, rooted in a fron-
tier past, built this university 140 
years ago; grand actions today will 
secure our legacy of access and 
excellence in the future.”

UC Served Legal Threat After Prop. 2 Study

By Sarah Alaoui
Contributing Writer

The Humane Society of the 
United States announced its decision 
to file suit against the University of 
California Sept. 5 after claiming the 
university withheld documents rel-
evant to Proposition 2.

If approved by voters in the 
upcoming November election, 
Prop. 2 — the Standards for 
Confining Farm Animals initiative 
statute — would attempt to improve 
how farm animals are confined by 
requiring that they have enough 
room to stand, turn around and lie 
down as well as adequate space to 
fully extend their limbs. 

The measure will focus specifi-
cally on veal crates, sow gestation 
crates and chicken battery cages, 
which are currently only required 
to have floor dimensions about the 
size of a piece of printer paper.

“This measure would guarantee 
animals basic, humane protections 
— animals built to move should 
be allowed to move,” said Jennifer 
Fearing, the YES! on Prop. 2 cam-
paign manager.

The Humane Society’s legal 
actions are in response to the 
university’s failure to produce any 
documents verifying that a July 22 
study published to show the eco-
nomic impact of Prop. 2 on farmers 
and consumers was funded solely 
by taxpayers and not by industry 
opponents of the measure such as 
the American Egg Board.

The study, released by the UC 
Agricultural Issues Center, focuses 

primarily on the economic changes 
California farmers and egg consum-
ers would face if Prop. 2 was imple-
mented and agriculture employees 
were required to overhaul their 
current caging apparatuses. 

The report goes on to predict a 
bleak outcome for the state’s econo-
my if the bill was passed: “Non-cage 
production costs are simply too far 
above the costs of the cage sys-
tems used in other states to allow 
California producers to compete 
with imported eggs in the conven-
tional egg market.”  

Humane Society representatives 
feel the study is an inaccurate por-
trayal of Prop. 2 because it fails to 
mention any advantages of the bill, 
therefore allegedly offering voters 
a skewed projection of its potential 
impacts. 

As time went on, Fearing said, 
the UC system not only failed to 
provide the documents, but also 
promoted “… the more hyperbolic 
and negative of the report’s conclu-
sions.” The animal rights organiza-
tion is worried that UC staff will 
withhold the documents until after 
the November election.

“California voters are entitled 
to the whole picture — we just 
want documented proof that the 
University of California funded this 

study on their own, if that is in fact 
what happened,” Fearing said.

University officials, however, 
maintain that the study was indeed 
funded in full by the university, and 
was not a product of any external 
interests. 

The univerity has explained 
their delay in fulfilling the Humane 
Society’s request as simply a period 
of time necessary to search for the 
documents in question and have 
continuously reassured the organi-
zation that the documents will be 
turned over in time for the upcom-
ing November election.

“The lawsuit is premature — we 
have every intention of giving them 
the records they’re requesting; we 
are not delaying for any other rea-
son other than the press of other 
records we’re supposed to find,” 
said Steve Drown, UC Davis camp 
counsel.

The Humane Society has not 
yet served the university with a 
formal lawsuit; the suit remains 
in Yolo County Superior Court in 
Woodland, Calif., while the orga-
nization waits for the university to 
produce the requested documents.

Drown added that the populari-
ty of the Prop. 2 debate has required 
university officials to advise UC 
employees to be careful when voic-
ing their opinions on the situation 
to ensure that their personal views 
aren’t mistaken for the university’s 
official stance on the matter.

“This has been a popular issue 
on the UC Davis campus,” Drown 
said of the Prop. 2 debate. “We 
have many employees opposing the 
initiative, but just as many in favor 
of it. We all just need to make sure 
those opinions are expressed as 
individual ones, and not ones rep-
resenting the university.”

As the animal rights 
debate continues, a new 
battle emerges over the 
university’s controversial 
economic findings.

By Danielle Warren
Staff Writer

A recent campus audit revealed 
that at least 13 percent of emergen-
cy loans granted to UCSD employ-
ees between Oct. 1, 2006, and Sept. 
30, 2007, were based on fraudulent 
documents.

The Employee Emergency Loan 
Fund, the program in question, 
provides up to $1,000 in loans to 
UCSD employees who prove to  
have an immediate need for funds 
as a result of unanticipated expens-
es or emergencies, and who have 
been denied the 
necessary mon-
etary aid else-
where. 

The yearlong 
audit found that 
at least 17 of 
131 loans were 
granted based 
on fraudulent 
documents pre-
pared by the 
fund supervisor. 
Overall, $15,000 
was distributed 
to employees 
who may not 
have been qualified to receive the 
loans. 

According to the audit, however, 
the financial risk to the university 
was minimal, as the loans reviewed 
were either repaid or in the process 
of repayment via payroll deduc-
tion.

The investigation was initiated 
after a UCSD Medical Group man-
ager discovered a file that con-
tained several suspect loan fund 
applications in the supervisor’s 
office, including seemingly forged 
documents and templates used to 

create forgeries, according to Sally 
Brainerd, associate controller for 
UCSD.

“It’s important to note that we 
caught this problem ourselves, and 
took immediate and appropriate 
actions to investigate and conduct 
an audit,” Brainerd said in an e-
mail.

The loan fund supervisor admit-
ted to completing only one fraud-
ulent document. The audit con-
cluded that she had been involved 
in many more questionable loans, 
after they were delivered to her by 
the union representative.

Additionally, 
the  audit 
uncoverd evi-
dence that sug-
gests one UCSD 
employee may 
have solicited $45 
to $50 in unau-
thorized pro-
cessing fees from 
loan applicants. 
The employee 
was trusted due 
to her longtime 
employment and 
position as a rep-
resentative with 

the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
union, the audit found. Union offi-
cials could not be reached for com-
ment. 

The UCSD supervisor who pre-
pared the fraudulent documents 
was placed on investigatory leave 
on Oct. 15, 2007, and chose to 
retire in January 2008. University 
officials declined to specify any 
disciplinary actions taken against 
the union representative due to the 

Questionable Campus Loan

study on their own.”

One particular contrast that 
Jacoby noted compared to his previ-
ous relief-effort experiences, howev-
er, was with the level of anticipation 
that surrounded this trip, as opposed 
to the relatively slow response offered 
during Hurricane Katrina. 

Jacoby said that government 
efforts were both much better pre-
pared this time around, and that 
a greater number of residents fol-
lowed local evacuation orders.

He said that though the num-
ber of people who decided not to 
evacuate was much lower than the 
60,000 to 80,000 who remained in 
their homes during Katrina, the 
number who did choose to ignore 
evacuation warnings during this 
latest disaster was still unfortu-
nately high.

“It’s always tragic when people 
assume that because they escaped 
the wrath of the last hurricane, it 
will be the same this time,” Jacoby 
said. “That assumption usually 
ends in people becoming stranded, 
injured or killed.”

The team was initially put on 
standby for Hurricane Gustav 
in August. Upon arrival, Gustav 
had already wreaked havoc on 
the country’s southern states and 
medical workers found themselves 
assisting with the aftermath of 
Gustav rather than standing by for 
Ike’s arrival. 

On Sept. 10, they moved into 
Houma, La., taking over for an 
Oregon DMAT crew treating those 
who fell victim to Gustav.

“Many hospitals were closed and 
evacuated in the area,” Jacoby said. 
“The treatment site was set up in 
the parking lot of a grocery store.”

He said that the general goal 
of the trip was to augment hospi-
tal emergency room traffic and to 
ensure that real emergencies were 
given precedence.

The night following the team’s 

arrival, tropical storm warnings 
sounded the arrival of Ike, leaving 
the team no choice but to evacu-
ate. 

“We were working and living in 
tents, so there was no way we could 

wait out the storm,” Rymer said. 
“This is probably the first time I’ve 
experienced two storms so close 
together.”

After Ike made landfall, the 
crew was flown to Lake Charles — 
Houma was later flooded by Ike.  

“We were placed in charge of 
caring for patients flown in by 
search-and-rescue teams,” Jacoby 
said. “There were also a lot of refu-
gees coming in from Texas, because 
Lake Charles is very near the state 
border.”

He added that three trainloads 
of 1,000 people each were relocated 
to the Lake Charles treatment area, 
seeking refuge from the storm.

“The hurricane area this time 
was so wide,” Rymer said. “This is 
why we did a lot of location hop-
ping — we were on call wherever 
we were needed.”

Hurricanes Gustav and Ike were 
both Category 4, with wind inten-
sities peaking at around 150 mph. 
Gustav caused 138 deaths and up to 
$15 billion in damage, according to 
Weather Underground.  

The costs from Ike are estimated 
at $27 billion with 145 deaths, mak-
ing it the third most costly hur-
ricane in recorded history, after 
Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and 
Andrew in 1992.

Team Relieves Crowded Hospitals, Provides Refugee Care

However, Kevin Reed, UCLA’s 
vice chancellor of legal affairs, 
claimed that the system in fact 
prevents collusion through its ran-
domized review procedure.

“[The holistic system] randomly 
assigns readers in a pool of more 
than 150 readers, combined with 
high-level review in the case of 
substantial disparity,” Reed said in 
a UCLA Today Online article. 

UCLA Chancellor Gene Block 
took a similar position in a state-
ment addressing the university’s 
admissions process. 

“Our admissions process is legal 
and fair, and UCLA neither dis-
criminates nor grants preference to 
prospective students based on race, 
ethnicity, sex or national origin,” 
Block said.

Yet, since the university began 
employing the more subjective 
admissions process last year, the 
number of admitted black students 
has increased 100 percent from the 
year before.

Groseclose cites this growing 
number as evidence that the com-
mittee faces “intense pressure from 
high-ranking officials for more 
minority — particularly African-
American — representation in the 
student body.”

Groseclose became most suspi-
cious of the campus’ admissions 
procedure when he was repeatedly 
denied access to admissions data 
he requested needed to conduct an 
investigation of the system. 

“I went through every single 
possible route,” Groseclose said. “I 
put in requests for the data to 
the chancellor, vice chancellor and 
several officials on the Academic 
Senate, and I also made it clear 
that if they do not provide me with 

the data, that is necessary and suf-
ficient for me to resign in protest, 
but every person just said no.”

University officials reportedly 
cited state and systemwide privacy 
laws to justify their refusal to turn 
over the requested data. Groseclose, 
however, believes that these privacy 
claims can only explain so much of 
the university’s refusal to turn over 
the requested data, as the decision 
to do so comes down to the judg-
ment of the chancellor.

“If you read the university’s pol-
icy on privacy, it explicitly states 
that any university official with 
an educational interest can look 
at these applications, and that the 
chancellor can decide which uni-
versity officials have educational 
interest,” Groseclose said. “There 
is no way that the privacy laws are 
preventing the chancellor from giv-
ing me the data.”

Although Groseclose does not 
believe that his report and resigna-
tion will severely impact prospec-
tive students’ decisions to apply to 
UCLA, he hopes that his actions will 
ultimately bring about  an increased 
level of transparency within the 
campus’ admissions process.

“Even if a professor wants to 
do further investigation on this 
issue right now, he or she will 
need a court order to subpoena 
these applicants,” Groseclose said. 
“The only way to get rid of mal-
feasance is for either the California 
Legislature or the faculty senate to 
recognize that there are too few 
eyes that can see these data, and 
to enact a rule that allows a dozen 
people with diverse political views 
for fair oversight.”

Harrison said both sets of nego-
tiations have taken longer than 
most union members expected, but 
that the union is interested in per-
manent solutions that cannot be 
achieved overnight.

“We are fundamentally chang-
ing their whole structure,” Harrison 
said. “We’re changing the way they 
pay people, the way they hire peo-
ple, and it takes time.”

Schwartz said the university’s 
bargaining teams have corresponded 
with AFSCME representatives regu-
larly since the strike, but the union 
has repeatedly refused the universi-
ty’s offers. The most recent service 
worker proposal — presented Sept. 
12 — would increase the service 
worker minimum wage to $13.25 
per hour and implement experi-
ence-based increases. In August, the 
university offered to guarantee a 
$15 minimum hourly wage for PCT 
workers by 2012. 

“Our focus remains on trying 
to solve the remaining differences,” 
he said. “We remain hopeful, but 
an agreement requires compromise 
from both sides.”

Harrison said these proposals 
would translate to a mere 30-cent 
raise for many employees this year, 
which she said is unacceptable. She 

said the university’s inclusion of 
a step-based pay system indicates 
“some movement” on the universi-
ty’s part, but that the system does not 
apply to employees of all disciplines.

At this point, the university has 
the power to impose a new contract 
for its workers, but the union has 
the right to respond with another 

strike. Both parties have said they 
remain willing to negotiate.

“There’s still a lot of fight in us, 
and we plan to do everything that 
we can to get the best thing for our 
workers,” Harrison said.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  11

The 10 research sites throughout 
the United States that comprise the 
consortium, including one located 
at the UCSD Medical Center, will 
work together to research ways in 
which to possibly prevent, mitigate 
and treat the symptoms displayed 
by victims.

“We are lucky in that we actually 
got two pieces of the whole pie,” said 
Raul Coimbra, who will be leading 
the San Diego TBI/PTSD clinical 
research center. “We are both over-
seeing the 10 sites involved in the 
consortium, as well as running a 
clinical research center right here 
in San Diego.”

While in the past, blast injuries 
received during military conflicts 
frequently resulted in fatalities, the 
advancement of both medical and 
military technology has increased 
survival rates and led to the new 
problem of how to deal with result-
ing brain injuries, principal inves-
tigator of the consortium Murray 
B. Stein said.

These battle wounds — referred 
to as TBI if they are severe, or 
concussions if they are mild — 
have been linked to the onset of 
symptoms associated with PTSD 
in a greater frequency than can be 
explained by chance, said Stein, 
who is also professor of psychiatry 
and family and preventive medicine 
at UCSD, and a staff psychiatrist 
for the VA San Diego Healthcare 
System.

Though the specific studies that 
will take place have not yet been 
selected, the recent discovery that 
patients exhibiting symptoms of 
both TBI and PTSD are less able 
to function on a daily basis than 
those with just one of the disorders 
ensures that their connection will 
undoubtedly be one of the matters 
investigated. 

“One disorder seems to com-
pound the disability of the other, 

and we don’t completely under-
stand why that is,” Stein said. 

Depending on the focus of the 
studies, investigators will be pre-
sented with a wide range of subject 
pools from which to draw. 

“From the VA hospital to the 
Level 1 Trauma Center at the UCSD 
Medical Center to the Navy Medical 
Center next to Balboa Park, we 
will have the opportunity to recruit 
individuals for our research from a 
large variety of target populations,” 
Stein said.

Researchers are hopeful that 
studies conducted on possible treat-
ments for PTSD/TBI at the VA hos-
pital — as well as other outpatient 
sites — could potentially result in 
findings that might directly benefit 
those specific populations in ques-
tion. 

With similar tests going on at 
all 10 sites, it will be possible for 
researchers to compile large sums 
of data combining important infor-
mation from subjects participat-
ing in the study at each research 
center.

“Studies will be set up and 
planned to run concurrently at the 
multiple sites so as to increase the 
number of subjects participating in 
our research,” Stein said.

Coimbra said researchers 
involved with the project will be 
concerned with three primary 
goals.

“We will be attempting to bet-
ter understand the relationship 
between mild TBI and the devel-
opment of PTSD, as has been 
observed in the current Iraq con-
flict; to work on ways in which to 
attenuate or prevent the symptoms 
that result from these disorders; 
and to research ways in which to 
reintegrate those individuals who 
suffer from the chronic symptoms 
of PTSD back into everyday soci-
ety,” Coimbra said. 

The population recruited for 
each of the specific projects will 
depend on the focus of the research 
study. 

“If we, for example, decide to 
do a study in which we test treat-
ments for those suffering from TBI, 
we will most likely involve sev-
eral trauma centers in our tests,” 
Coimbra said. 

Researchers hope they will learn 
how to intervene in cases in which 
an individual has a TBI, so as to 
prevent PTSD symptoms from set-
ting in and making a bad situation 
worse.

Stein, as the consortium’s direc-
tor, will work with investigators 
nationwide in hopes of moving  
toward solutions to some of today’s 
biggest unanswered questions 
regarding PTSD and TBI.

“Personally, I am looking for-
ward to working with talented, 
experienced researchers, and get-
ting to pick their brains as we work 
toward developing research that 
will hopefully make a major impact 
and produce results and working 
treatments for PTSD/TBI in the 
near future, if not immediately,” 
Stein said.

Crescenzo at sdecresc@ucsd.edu.

Solar Energy Takes Root on Campus
By Nimesh Rajakumar
Staff Writer

Efficiency and organic aesthet-
ics will be the hallmarks of both 
the Gilman and Hopkins Parking 
Structures this year, with the instal-
lation of a new, environmentally 
conscious technology called the 
solar tree.

Once installed on the roofs of 
the two parking structures, the new 
solar panels are intended to provide 
a wealth of clean electricity for 
campus, create shade for parked 
cars and supply charging boxes for 
electric vehicles, while remaining 
pleasing to the eye.

The solar tree structure, 
designed by the San Diego-based 
company Envision Solar, consists 
of a single column with a large 
solar “canopy” resting on top. The 
column itself will act as a bollard 
to stop the vehicle in the parking 
space.

Envision’s solar tree was chosen 
for having the best cost-for-quality 
value among other competitive bids 
to place solar panels atop the two 
parking structures.

The entire solar project will pro-
duce one megawatt of energy for 
the campus. According to UCSD 
Energy and Utilities Manager John 
Dilliott, putting up additional solar 
panels would have been economi-
cally unfeasible because one mega-
watt is the incentive cap provided 
by the state.

Solar Power Partners, a 
California solar-power project 
developer, is funding the $9-mil-
lion project in conjunction with 
UCSD. The campus will be paying 
for the energy through SPP as part 
of a 20-year contract, after which 
the entire system will be owned 
by UCSD. The cost will come out 
of the campus’ monthly utilities 
budget at the same price as energy 

purchased from the campus’ previ-
ous electricity supplier.

“We’re doing what we can with 
the purchase utilities budget,” 
Dilliott said.

Although the first columns for 
the solar trees were installed in 
September, the system is not esti-
mated to be fully operational until 
December, once wiring is com-
plete.

The goal of the solar tree is to 
eliminate the need for multiple col-
umns to hold up a solar array: As 
Envision likes to put it, “cars and 
columns don’t mix.” 

These structures are an example 
of bio-mimicry — the application 
of biological structures to mod-
ern engineering, Envision’s Chief 
Operating Officer Pamela Stevens 
said.

The solar canopy will maximize 
its own efficiency by constantly 
orienting its photovoltaic cells in 
various positions so that the sun 
is always in direct contact, at least 
partially, with the cells.

The panels will also reduce 
the amount of heat observed in 
the parking lots. In normal lots, 
concrete and car metal retain heat 
in the immediate area, maintain-
ing warmth well into the evening. 
Photovoltaic panels avoid this heat 

island effect by directly absorbing 
the heat.

In addition, the inclusion of an 
electric car-charging box will not 
only create some of San Diego’s first 
electric car infrastructure, but is 
also part of Envision’s overarching 
goal to integrate parking.

Envision predicts that in the 
future, parking near a solar tree 
will double as a trip to refuel with 
clean solar electricity. According 
to Stevens, refueling will no longer 
exist as a distinct event, but will 
rather be integrated into everyday 
driving activities.

Solar trees are one small step 
toward UCSD’s goal to become to 
being a leader in renewable energy 
use among universities nationwide. 
Although state incentives for solar 
power are capped at one megawatt, 
the campus is looking into other 
forms of renewable energy.

“We’re pursuing a fuel cell and 
wind power, which each have their 
own incentives,” Dilliott said.

The fuel cell, which will con-
vert waste methane to electricity, is 
projected to increase UCSD’s green 
energy production from one mega-
watt to 2.5 megawatts.

Rajakumar at nrajakum@ucsd.edu.

confidentiality of the matter, not-
ing only that she was referred for 
“corrective actions.”

The audit also states that the 
applicants were unaware of the 
supervisor’s actions.

UCSD officials also declined 
to comment on 
why no crimi-
nal charges were 
filed against 
either employee.

Both the 
e m p l o y e e s 
and applicants 
involved in the 
i n v e s t i g a t i o n 
worked for the 
UCSD Medical 
Center. The 
supervisor and 
union represen-
tative handling 
the loans were not named.

The short-term loan program 
was created in 1970 for UCSD 
employees with a solid or bet-
ter performance rating in need of 
emergency funds, and who were 
turned down for at least one loan 
from a bank or credit union. The 
loans are issued from a UC fund, 
and the applicants may receive bet-
ter-than-market rates.  

The program requires written 

denial of a loan application from a 
bank or credit union, as well as docu-
ments confirming the purpose of the 
loan. Fraudulent documents found 
by the audit included loan denial let-
ters and car repair estimates.

According to Brainerd, the univer-
sity is not aware of any previous prob-

lems with the loan 
fund program.

“As a large 
university, we’re 
constantly moni-
toring our systems 
and looking for 
ways to improve 
our oversight, 
m a n a g e m e n t 
and operating 
responsibilities,” 
Brainerd said.

To safeguard 
against such prob-
lems occurring in 

the future, UCSD now requires that 
applicants provide original docu-
ments supporting their loan request 
at the time that they personally sign 
the promissory note. A designated 
department official is required to 
approve all emergency loans, in 
addition to the assistant director of 
Student Business Services.

OPINION

By Hadley Mendoza
     Senior Staff Writer

ON CAMPUS — This year new students to UCSD’s Sixth 
College moved into thoroughly green-friendly dorms. Instead 
of the customary paper move-in forms, freshmen will be fill-

ing out their housing info online. Their new rooms are decorated 
with carpet and furniture made from recycled materials, equipped with 

low-flow showerheads to conserve water and energy-efficient lighting. And 
along with the Gilman and Hopkins Parking Structures, the Sixth residence 
halls were outfitted with photovoltaic solar panels. 

A number of groups have come together on this project; upon moving 
in Sixth students will receive a reusable plastic water bottle and Housing, 
Dining, Hospitality will provide discounts for students who use the 
bottles, and interns from Green Campus will be providing compact fluo-
rescent light bulbs so that students can cut down on their energy use. 

But the Sixth College renovations are just a few of the many steps 
UCSD has taken this summer to propel its campuswide green goal. An 
increased number of recycling bins are available around campus, in 
addition to new compost bins. Many dining commons campuswide have 
introduced eco-friendly dishware and sustainability-minded products.

Though Sixth may have recently renovated its living accommoda-
tions to assist in the university’s green effort, there is no reason students 
across campus can’t make similar changes to help the environment. 
Green Campus interns, for example, will be making their rounds to all of 
UCSD’s college to distribute energy-saving CFL bulbs. And by spending 
a little more now, students off campus can cut their yearlong energy bills 
significantly by also making the switch to CFLs. 

Students can also follow Sixth’s lead by carrying Nalgenes, stocking 
their new digs with eco-friendly cleaning supplies, grabbing some super-
cheap reusable grocery bags to cut down on plastic-bag waste and making 
a conscious effort to recycle the paper, plastic and aluminum products 
they use. All these changes are small, but imagine the difference 22,000 
undergrads could make.

And simple adjustments such as these will have a tremendous posi-
tive impact on the environment, and it’s great to finally see a systematic 
transformation taking place. UCSD has taken steps in the past to reduce 
its carbon footprint, but by calling upon students to take an active role 
in conservation and environmentalism — with orientation initiatives, 
dorm changes and green seminars — the university is helping to create a 
generation of eco-aware citizens.

Fall Forecast: 
Fabulous Fun 

With a Chance 
of Controversy

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — 
Come this fall, California voters will 
be faced with an age-old dilemma: 
Which came first, the chicken or the 
egg? In this case they won’t be bicker-
ing about evolution, but rather the 
source of eggs in their grocery stores 
and McMuffins.

Specifically, Proposition 2, also 
called the Standards for Confining 
Farm Animals initiative statute, calls 
for adding a chapter to California’s 
Health and Safety Code to ban the 
confinement of animals in a manner 
that does not allow them free range 
of movement, focusing on three types 
of caging: veal crates, sow gestation 
crates and battery cages for chickens.

If passed, farmers across the state 
would have until Jan. 1, 2015, to 
comply with the measure by altering 
space requirements for their animals, 
and they would be prevented from 
housing any animals in such ways in 
the future. 

Although chickens might be flap-
ping their wings over the initiative, 
California’s egg industry is definitely 
crying foul, claiming that a switch 
to cage-free farming techniques 

would irreversibly destroy their busi-
nesses. And they’re right. The pork 
and veal industries across the state 
would change significantly with the 
alterations in animal housing, but 
the biggest shockwave would reel 
throughout California henhouses, 
where current confinement methods 
in which chickens are kept in stacked 
cages would be 
banished, leading 
to a huge eco-
nomic downfall 
and eventually the 
collapse of hun-
dreds of farming 
businesses.

In California, 
the thriving $337-
million egg indus-
try is no yolk, 
err, joke. Farmers 
statewide produce about five billion 
eggs every year, using about 20 mil-
lion hens. The state produces about 6 
percent of the nation’s table egg sup-
ply, and consumes nearly 12 percent. 
Currently, only about 5 percent of 
eggs produced in the state come from 
cage-free hens.

According to a UC Davis study 
released in July, if Proposition 2 pass-
es then the state egg industry faces a 

collapse because of all the new regula-
tions farmers will be forced to adopt. 
According to the study’s authors, 
Proposition 2 would add up to 20 
percent to the costs of egg production 
in the state, in effect flinging the door 
wide open for eggs to be imported 
from Mexico and other states where 
hens are still kept in cages.

“The most 
likely outcome, 
therefore, is the 
elimination of 
almost all of the 
California egg 
industry over a 
very few years,” 
said the study’s 
lead author Daniel 
Sumner, director 
of the Agricultural 
Issues Center, and 

Frank H. Buck Jr., a professor at the 
UC Davis Department of Agricultural 
and Resource Economics.

Funded solely by the University 
of California and using information 
from numerous sources in addition 
to cost information from farmers 
who use both types of caging systems, 
the study found that the adoption of 
Proposition 2 would lead to higher 
feeding costs, housing costs, pullet 

costs and labor costs for every dozen 
eggs that is produced in the state, as 
well as force producers to invest $500 
million to construct new or retro-fit-
ted caging systems that comply with 
the new restrictions. In short, the 
costs of non-cage production are just 
too much higher than the costs of 
cage systems used in other states to 
allow California farmers to remain 
competitive within the industry.

Higher production costs aside, 
the study also found that if adopt-
ed Proposition 2 would also lead to 
the elimination of nearly 3,000 jobs 
across the state, mostly in Southern 
California, Sonoma County and the 
Central Valley, leading to a signifi-
cant negative impact on the California 
economy, especially in rural areas such 
as Merced County, which has pov-
erty and unemployment rates that run 
much higher than the state average.

In San Diego County alone, 
egg farmers — mostly from inland 
North County near Valley Center, 
Escondido and Ramona — produce 
800 million eggs per year, worth about 
$36.4 million. But ranchers have said 
that Proposition 2 would make egg 
farming uneconomical, with Kevin

“Although chickens might be flapping their wings over the initiative, California’s egg industry 
is definitely crying foul.”

    Going Green 
       Is Simple,  
             for 
         Tritons
   Old and New

Whether you’re a naive, bright-eyed incom-ing freshman, a slightly 
more jaded returning student with 
a few years to go, or a senior just 
excited to graduate and get out of La 
Jolla, you’re in for a happy surprise 
— this year is packed with enough 
historic events, policy changes and 
expanded resources to make even 
the most cynical undergrad a little 
excited about college. 

And thank God, I’ve been wait-
ing three years for something cool 
to happen around here.

If you haven’t registered to vote 
yet, definitely add it to your list of 
move-in to-dos. 

There’s no question that this 
year’s election is a huge deal, and 
chances are it will be your first 
time voting for the nation’s highest 
office. That’s something you don’t 
want to miss because unless you 
live in a cave, whoever is elected 
will be making decisions that will 
seriously affect your post-college, 
real-life-adult self. 

So use that Internet connec-
tion for something other than 
video games, educate yourself 
about the candidates and hit up the 
post office, Department of Motor 
Vehicles or one of the many orga-
nizations frequently registering 
people on Library Walk. It doesn’t 
matter if you’re pulling for the 
Barracuda, or wanting to Barack 
the Vote — get out there come 
Election Day to decide what the 
next four years will hold.

Closer to home, there will be 
some equally big decisions happen-
ing on campus that students should 
keep an eye on. The administra-
tion is making some huge changes 
to student freedom on campus — 
after a yearlong debate, UCSD’s free 
speech policies pertaining to major 
campus centers are still murky at 
best, and while administrators, 
advisory boards, the A.S. Council 
and various committees caucus and 
pontificate, not much has actually 
been done to ensure freedom for 
the student body. 

Our constitutional rights are 
being stripped from us, and this 
year students need to stand up to 
reclaim them loud and clear.

But these important on-cam-
pus issues aren’t limited to policy 
changes and power struggles. Last 
year’s Sun God Festival was a com-
plete 180 away from celebrations 
past, and a hot debate is sure to 
arise this year as the Associated 
Student Council plans Sun God 
2009 around the question of wheth-
er that switch was for the better. 
Regardless of your interest in exer-
cising rights, Sun God marks the 
single day each year when Tritons 
let their hair down and we need to 
participate in the school’s political 
process too, or risk losing this leg-
endary celebration.

Stealing

Economy Demands Free-Range Finances Before Fowl



TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer 

ON CAMPUS — At the beginning 
of each new quarter, you the duti-
ful student take that dreaded trip 
down to Price Center’s textbook 
dungeon, grab whatever’s available 
for your new set of courses — usu-
ally not much, seeing that for every 
hour that passes, a dozen more 
over-prepared UCSD nerds will 
raid the emptying shelves and buy 
at least two copies of everything 
you need — scrawl out a check to 
UC Regents and file the cost some-
where in the back of your mind 
with all those other bothers to be 
dealt with once the loan opportuni-
ties stop flowing like wine.

Like all other collegiate fees we 
grudgingly but so often do cave to 
— if only to rid ourselves of nag-
ging university bill notices — text-
book prices are generally presented 
and accepted as one more manda-

tory cost in the student budget. 
But unlike random activity fees or 
campus health insurance, the hun-
dreds of dollars we drop on books 
every quarter is contributing to the 
larger American dilemma that is 
created by acquiring what quickly 
becomes junk. After a quick bout of 
consumption directly before finals, 
we toss the book aside — either in 
a pile of crap to go through around 
the same time those loans start 
needing to be repayed or, worse, in 
the landfill — trashing not only our 
own hard-earned dollars but all the 
energy and resources it took to pro-
duce the book in the first place.

Sure, used books are bought back 
and resold through the university, but 
at such low and high values respec-
tively that the process is largely disre-
garded by we the busy students, who 
always seem to have something better 
to do. Plus, since professors con-
stantly insist on requiring updated 
versions of their textbooks for the 
sake of no more than a couple pages 
of new material — which could be 
easily photocopied and distributed in 
class — all old editions of the book 
are rendered instantly undesirable 
and hold an unlikely chance of ever 
again being redistributed to incom-
ing students.  

There’s no single individual to 
blame for the inefficiency of the 
textbook cycle — self-interest along 
every step of the way hinders an 
effective circle of reuse from being 
possible on a large scale. The text 
publishers and UC Regents first hope 
to make money off the sales; students 
are then either too impatient or apa-
thetic to pursue their texts outside 

of the bookstore; after a course has 
finished, neither professors nor stu-
dents pay attention to what happens 
to its required reading; and so on 
and so forth until a student’s four- or 
five-year academic course has been 
run and dealing effectively with old 
textbooks seems nothing but a waste 
of time.

But there are some resources 
available that make it at least more 

possible, with only a small effort 
on our part, to avoid perpetuat-
ing such wasteful practice. With 
our level of online communication 
having reached such epic propor-
tions, it seems a shame not to milk 
the instant connection we have to 
almost everyone in the UC com-
munity for all it’s worth — Web sites 
like Half.com, Craiglist and even 
Facebook offer services in which to 
buy and sell our textbooks at frac-
tions of the price. Similarly, UC net-
works like WebCT and just simple 
listservs can be utilized by pro-
fessors and TAs to post electronic 
editions of the required material, 
saving an entirely unnecessary pro-
cess of high-energy production and 
inefficient consumption.

If you do find yourself at the 
very last minute without a textbook 
crucial to your class, there are a 
variety of other locations at which 
to acquire the material — like the 
General Store Co-op or Groundwork 
Books, both located conveniently 
on campus. Purchasing used books 
from nonprofit vendors such as these 
also assists in somewhat removing 
the main flow of book traffic from 
UCSD’s superstore, shifting the cycle 
into a more balanced and evenly dis-
tributed process.

The university — which func-
tions like any other corporation, 
abeit one with a higher-minded 
purpose — can’t always be expect-
ed to have our best interests in 
mind, especially when those inter-
ests involve us conserving perfectly 
good money that could easily be 
cared for by the regents. But if only 
for the small part it could play 
in the worldwide struggle to cut 
down excessive resource consump-
tion, the university system might 
consider bowing its great head to 
at least consider the array of simple 
alternatives to high textbook pro-
duction, year after year.

General education classes that a 
majority of UCSD undergraduates 
must take at some point in their 
college career — say, BILD 1 — are 
major culprits, filled with freshmen 
for whom buying new, shiny text-
books still carries an air of excite-
ment. If the regents purchased even 
a hundred books to put on reserve 
in Geisel Library, thousands of dol-
lars in soon-to-be-pointless textbook 
transactions could be saved. After all, 
the library’s looking pretty shiny at 
that point, too.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY. SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

Yes, there’s a strong wind of 
change this year. Don’t believe me? 
Just walk around and this brand 
new UCSD is apparent — both 
Price Center and Student Center 
have undergone 
major changes 
and last year’s 
f r u s t r a t i n g 
c o n s t r u c t i o n 
maze is almost 
entirely gone. 
The Student 
Center has more 
study areas 
and is home to 
revamped favor-
ites like three 
co-ops and 
KSDT radio. 

As you’ve probably already 
heard, Price Center boasts a whole 
new wing. Now students have a ton 
more study lounges, all their once-
sprawled campus resources in once 
place and even a nightclub. 

Say what you like about the Loft: 
It’s snobby, it’s contrived, it’s trying 
too hard, it’s designed for faculty 
and grad students to enjoy, all that 
may be true, but it’s also a night-
club; a place for social gathering 
and merriment. This simple fact 

makes it about 1,000 times more 
worth your time to check out than 
any regular old nighttime hangout 
— give Geisel Library a break for 
one night and give the Loft the 
old college try. Sure, it could be 

lame, but what if 
it’s not? Add the 
s o on-promis e d 
RIMAC Annex 
and you’ve got 
two small steps 
for UCSD pres-
ent, but a giant 
leap for overall 
college enjoy-
ment years to 
come. 

I challenge 
every undergrad, 
however skepti-

cal, to embrace these changes. Get 
involved on campus and this year 
at the polls, speak to your student-
body leaders and let them know 
which initiatives you want to see 
more of. 

Who knows? A few years down 
the line we might see students hav-
ing fun for no reason, or even 
greeting a stranger with a friendly 
“hello” simply because he’s a fellow 
Triton. And that would be a UCSD 
we’d all be a little sad to leave.

Improvements Today Make 
for a Friendlier Tomorrow

Republicans to Promise 
Further Problems

Dear Editor,
A rescue plan for our fail-

ing economy requires an additional 
$700,000,000,000. To raise this horrific 
sum, Congress must increase the cur-
rent federal debt limit so the Feds can 
borrow enough to fund the program. 
The national debt is now $32,000 per 
American citizen and increasing at a 
rate of $2 billion per DAY. The finger 
points at Bush and his Republican/
Libertarian party for irresponsible 

deregulation. Most experts, including 
a majority of Congress and Federal 
Reserve members, now agree that 
deregulation was American capitalism’s 
downfall. Bush’s answer: Borrow more 
and let the middle class taxpayer pay — 
for the next century at least. With the 
government taking over free enterprise, 
we are left with corporate socialism. 
Once again, Republican ideology, also 
responsible for undermining federal 
integrity and foreign respect, starting 
illegal and unjustified wars, corrupt-
ing the government and democracy, 
opposing environmental protection 
and opposing a woman’s right to birth 

control and abortion, is now a financial 
disaster as well. Want more? Then vote 
Republican/Libertarian.

— Milton H. Saier, Jr. 
Professor of biology, UCSD

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Demler, the owner of the county’s 
biggest egg farm, the 1-million hen 
Pine Hill Egg Ranch in Ramona, tell-
ing the North County Times that the 
costs of altering current methods to 
comply with the proposed law would 
be “prohibitive.” Other local farm-
ers have gone a step further, saying 
they will go out of business if the law 
passes.

Backed by the Humane Society 
of the United States, Proposition 2 
is meant to end supposed inhumane 
confinement of specified animals on 
large factory farms by forcing farm-
ers to end the practice of keeping 
animals so closely confined that they 
are physically unable to turn around, 
lie down or fully extend their legs or 
wings. Proponents claim that battery 
cages lead to higher concentrations 
of bird feces coming in contact with 
eggs, increasing the risk of salmonel-
la, and claim that moving away from 
the battery-cage system will lead to a 
healthier food supply. 

But because state farmers must 
already adhere to established regula-
tions set by the California Egg Quality 
Assurance Plan, which requires that 
farmers use the most modern egg-
farming techniques and standards, 
the risk of egg-related salmonella 

infections is virtually nonexistent 
even within battery-cage systems. In 
fact, the California Department of 
Food and Agriculture has not found 
a single salmonella case linked to 
eggs produced in the state in nearly 
a decade. And the modern systems 
used by egg farms effectively separate 
feces from coming into contact with 
the eggs.

Furthermore, Proposition 2 
will eliminate Californians’ abil-
ity to purchase locally grown eggs, 
because the industry will compen-
sate for the changes in California 
law by simply importing eggs from 
other places.

Although cruelty to animals is 
abhorrent and the parts of the initia-
tive regulating veal and pork farmers 
are worthy, Californians would be 
irresponsible to pass Proposition 2 as 
is because of the extremely negative 
economic impacts it will bring to the 
state egg industry. At a time when 
the economy is so fragile, the drastic 
changes outlined by Proposition 2 
will do more harm than good for 
California. In this case, the egg defi-
nitely should come before the chick-
en.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

T his summer, Earl Warren College senior Sandra Gutierrez stepped off a worn bus onto the cold, wintry grounds of Valparaíso, Chile. The scene was slightly cha-
otic, as she and 23 other students waited to 
meet their host families. 

Although Gutierrez speaks highly of her 
experiences in Chile, she was taken aback by 
the low number of Latino participants in her 
program. Out of 150 students, only four others 
were Latino.

During her six-week stay in Chile, Gutierrez 
learned that several host families who had 
been accommodating foreign students for 
years had never housed a Latino student. In 
discussions with some of her fellow study-
abroad companions she came to realize that 
many of them shared her observations. 

These circumstances fueled her decision 
to become involved with the Programs 
Abroad Office at UCSD, where she is cur-
rently a student assistant. Alongside her 
office duties, she plans to reach out to 
minority students in order to increase 
their numbers abroad as well as com-
bat false impressions they may have 
about overseas travel.   

“I think there are a lot of mis-
conceptions about the prices and 
being able to take classes and 
still graduate on time,” Gutierrez 
said. “I want to see what more 
effective forms we can use to 
encourage Latino students.”

Kimberly Burton, direc-
tor of the Programs Abroad 

Office, noted that one goal 
of the program is to keep 
the number of minor-

ity students abroad 
at least consistent 

with the number 
of minority stu-

dents in actual 
attendance at 

UCSD.

According to UCSD’s 2007 enrollment sta-
tistics Latinos and Mexican-Americans make 
up 12 percent of the student body. 

PAO offers three different study abroad pro-
grams, each with a slightly different approach 
to overseas education: the Education Abroad 
Program, Opportunities Abroad Program and 
Global Studies.

Gutierrez, like many other study-abroad 
students, always knew that she wanted to travel, 
and although she was extremely active in mak-
ing it a reality when she came to UCSD, there 
were still obstacles that she had to surmount. 

“I can say that on my behalf it was somewhat 
of a financial issue, maybe a cultural issue,” 
Gutierrez said. “I know that [going abroad is] 
not something that happens very often within 
the Latino culture.” 

Gutierrez noticed that most of the white 
students she met in her program had gone 
abroad prior to visiting Chile. 

“In my immediate family I’m the first one 
to go to a different country,” Gutierrez said. 
“Then I realized that for a lot of other students 
it was like nothing for them. Obviously there’s 
a bigger level of acceptance outside of Latino 
culture.”  

Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman Lauren 
Havens participated in a community service 
program in Latin America while in high school. 
She does not foresee any obstacles when intro-
ducing the idea of travel abroad to her parents, 
and is already looking into options such as 
Spain, Italy or Brazil. 

“My dad did a year in Brazil when he was 
in high school, so they better understand,” 
Havens said. 

Meanwhile, Gutierrez said that convincing 
her parents of her overseas plans was difficult. 

“It was hard to explain the process to them,” 
she said. “What I was going to be doing; if I 
was going to be safe. For other cultures it might 
be something more normal or expected of the 
students to do.” 

I ts placement within a cramped strip mall on Convoy Street makes Min Sok Chon easy to 
overlook — it sits next to Travel 
Land, a dentist’s office and State 
Farm Insurance. Once inside, 
however, diners are treated to a 
charming re-creation of a Korean 
folk village (which is what “Min 
Sok Chon” literally means) where 
boisterous guests enjoy a tradi-
tional Korean meal to the musical 
styling of anyone brave enough to 
pick up a microphone. 

Authenticity is a priority from 
the moment guests are escort-
ed to one of many hut-like din-
ing areas, where they sit at low 
wooden tables beneath hanging 
paper lamps. For privacy diners 

can draw their bamboo shades. 
Min Sok Chon’s impressive menu 
seems an endless list of dishes 
and drinks all numbered for effi-
ciency. While the eatery does 
away with the Western custom of 
incessantly checking on the prog-
ress of a guest’s meal, this in no 
way detracts from their service. 
Waiters are prompt and attentive 
when buzzed, bringing carts of 
stir-fries and seafood. 

For the Asian cuisine aficio-
nado — or simply those with more 
adventurous taste buds — Min 
Sok Chon offers heuk yum so 
jungol (black goat meat with veg-
etable soup), agu chim (stir-fried 
monkfish) or jang uh gui (grilled 
eel). For first-timers or those 

more reluctant in their eat-
ing endeavors, the savory 
bulgogi (marinated beef) 
and crunchy goonmandoo 
(fried homemade dumplings) are 
great starters. Each dish is served 
with a plethora of banchan (side 
dishes) including individual rice 
bowls, kimchi and a variety of dip-
ping sauces. 

Open from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
nightly, it’s the perfect place for 
group outings. The food, which 
comes in sharable portions, runs 
the gamut from cheap — $8.95 
for dumplings — to overpriced 
— $29.95 for black goat meat and 
veggie soup. Min Sok Chon’s drink 
selection is enough to start any 
party. The swanky bar serves the 

familiar whiskies, 
beers, wines and cocktails as 
well as authentic favorites like soju 
(Korean rice vodka). Soju, brought 
by the pitcher to your table, comes 
in 16 fruity flavors. But the reason 
Min Sok Chon trumps the aver-
age night hangout spot is its five 
private karaoke rooms that span 
the perimeter of the restaurant, 
all rentable by the hour — $25 if 
your party sings, more if you don’t 
to ensure that rooms are always 
available for karaoke enthusiasts. 

Providing an authentic place to 

eat, drink and sing like no one’s 
business, Min Sok Chon is the 
perfect place for a late night 
adventure with friends.

Lyon, using the Velov system, which provides

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  21

Ihad never been to Lyon before, but as soon as I arrived it was immediately clear why every 
person I consulted while choosing 
a city in which to study suggested 
Lyon without hesitation. My land-
lord met me at the train station, 
and after we dropped off my bags at 
his house, he and his wife gave me a 
tour of France’s second city. 

Knowing that Lyon is home to 
just under a half-million people, I 
was confused 
when we 
turned up the 
street to grab 
the tramway 
rather than 
driving. I 
soon discov-
ered that Lyon 
might be the 
least imposing metropolis in the 
world. 

Lyon’s city center is an area of 
plazas and 18th-century buildings 
on the Presq’île (almost island) that 
stands between two gorgeous rivers 
running north-to-south through 
the city. We visited the closest thing 
to a skyscraper Lyon has and the 
sprawling hillside above Old Lyon, 
which, on a clear day has a view all 
the way to the French Alps. 

Walking back down the hill into 
Old Lyon, I was treated to an expe-
rience few other history majors at 
UCSD get to try for themselves 
— a journey through the trabouls of 
Lyon. These underground tunnels 
originally served as passageways 
for the city’s famous silk indus-
try, but during World War II they 
became the center of the resistance 
movement against Nazi Germany. 

I have traveled to many historic 
landmarks in Europe, but going 
through the trabouls and knowing 
they were a part of my new home 
— and not just a stop on a family 
vacation — brought the history to 

life and allowed me to connect with 
Lyon on a completely new level. 

We spent the whole day walking 
around Lyon and although I saw 
plenty of parked cars, I was never 
once apprehensive about being a 
pedestrian. In Lyon, instead of hav-
ing to deal with crazed French driv-
ers, the city’s main transport prob-
lem is periodic bicycle shortages. 
About 10 years ago the city started 
a huge project, which has now been 

r e p l i c a t e d 
t h r o u g h -
out France, 
to provide 
a system of 
free bicycles 
to all its citi-
zens. I haven’t 
walked three 
blocks with-

out seeing a long line of red bikes 
docked and waiting for a local 
Lyonnais to take one for a spin 
up the banks of the Rhône and 
through the gardens in the Parc de 
la Tête d’Or. 

To have access to the Velov 
system you must be a tax-paying 
resident of Lyon, and since I only 
just signed the contract for my 
apartment, I’ll have to wait before I 
can start exploring the city on two 
wheels. It’s obvious how French 
people stay so much fitter than 
we do; they live such an active 
lifestyle. 

The overall health of French 
people also gets a big boost from 
their mentality on eating, which is 
all about quality over quantity. In 
Lyon there is enough quality food 
to keep me happy for a thousand 
lifetimes. I am beyond lucky to be 
living in the gastronomic capital 
of Europe — it’s just a shame that I 
can’t afford any of it. 

One of these days I’ll starve 
myself for a bit, save up some euros 
and treat myself to a few Lyonnais 

delicacies, which are known to 
be some of the best dishes in the 
world. And until then, daily tomato 
and cheese sandwiches on the best 
bread in the world will keep me 
more than happy. 

Considering that my diet this 
year will consist of pasta and stir-
fry, it’s great that I found an incred-
ibly cheap produce store just around 
the corner from my apartment to 
get tasty fruits and veggies to spice 
up my otherwise bland dishes. Oh, 
and even cheap bottles of wine here 
are actually legitimately good. 

When I was in middle school I 
spent three weeks touring France 
with my family, so I vaguely remem-
ber that the country, the people and 
the culture wasn’t radically different 
from what I was used to back home. 
Even with that obvious knowledge, 
part of me still hoped that some-
how the place where I was going to 
spend my junior year abroad would 
be entirely different from anything 
that I had ever seen. 

That part of me was disappoint-
ed when I remembered France isn’t 
exactly remote. The cars here are 
more economical than in the United 
States, the currency much stron-
ger and I’ve been told that even 
the food at the French McDonald’s 
tastes better. 

While walking through certain 
French neighborhoods, I could have 
sworn I was in New York’s SoHo or 
San Francisco’s North Beach . Even 
the average Frenchman seems to 
know more about American poli-
tics than most of my compatriots 
back home.

Life here is definitely similar 
to the States, as I’m sure it is in all 
first-world countries. But in my 
first month in France, I found so 
many little differences that added 
up way too quickly and before I 
knew it I was experiencing a new 
obstacle daily, regardless of how 

familiar my new surroundings 
might have been. Some challenges 
have been more blatant, and thus 
easier to handle, like ending up 
30 minutes away from the correct 
metro stop because at the time 
“Gare de Venise” sounded exactly 
like “Gare de Vennisieux.” Others 
have been far subtler; these chal-
lenges will be the ones that will give 
me the opportunity to grow and 
step outside my California-grown 
bubble. 

I can only hope that this year will 
keep getting better and prove to be 
a life-changing experience. For that 
to happen, I need to continue hav-
ing the right mindset of que sera, 
sera: whatever happens, happens. I 

need to have enough confidence in 
myself to make as many mistakes 
as it takes for me to improve. Of 
course, a little more outstanding 
French food and a few bottles of 
fine wine sure won’t hurt.

well as cultural observations 

during his time studying 
abroad in Lyon, France. 



22 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

Language barriers may also pre-
vent parents from fully compre-
hending the students’ plans, accord-
ing to Gutierrez. 

“All the information is in English 
so I had to translate everything 
and explain everything and help 
them understand what I was getting 
myself into,” Gutierrez said. 

To address this issue in the past, 
EAP produced a Spanish version of 
an informational document that stu-
dents could give to their parents. 

Additionally, Burton explained 
that some minority students are their 
families’ first generation enrolled in 
college. 

“For many of these students it’s 
such a big deal to get accepted to 
UCSD,” Burton said. “For a lot of 
them, thinking of going abroad is 
like thinking of going to the moon, 
it’s such a foreign concept for them, 
and that’s part of the struggle.” 

Consequently, the issue of paren-
tal consent and understanding 
has become a much more impor-
tant issue for PAO in the past few 
years. Last spring, the office held 
its first orientation session for par-
ents, which ran alongside its general 
orientation program. According to 
Burton, the program was a success. 

Many parents, explained Burton, 
fail to grasp the extent of the ben-
efits of going abroad, which can 
expand options for post-gradua-

tion plans and provide an oppor-
tunity for students to augment a 
textbook education with cultural 
understanding. 

Other steps that are being taken 
to overcome barriers preventing 
minority students from studying 
abroad include group discussion 
sessions and surveys that could help 
identify some of the more pertinent 
issues. 

A diversity focus group, orga-

nized by PAO, will meet on Oct. 
24 to connect students of diverse 
ethnicities who have been abroad. 
In these sessions, students discuss 
topics such as what motivated them 
to go abroad, why they chose their 
particular destination and how par-
ticipation numbers of minorities 
can be improved. 

Gutierrez, in her coming efforts 
to increase awareness and encour-

age minority students to study 
abroad, hopes to start educating 
students earlier about the opportu-
nities that await. 

By informing students while they 
are still in high school, Gutierrez 
aims to prepare them for the some-
times tedious process of keeping up 
with deadlines and meetings that 
inevitably come with the act of going 
abroad so as to ease the process 
and assure their place in the foreign 
sphere. 

Gutierrez hopes that for minority 
families, informing parents early on 
through continued parent confer-
ences may help bridge the cultural 
and language barriers that are often 
deterring factors. 

When Gutierrez first met her 
host family, they immediately wel-
comed her warmly into their home. 
Everything from different eating 
times to having to manually heat up 
water before taking a shower was a 
new experience for her. 

“Now I’ve realized that you 
should pretty much get as much as 
you can out of your higher educa-
tion,” Gutierrez said. “I seriously felt 
that in the whole K-12 plus through 
UCSD years I had never learned 
as much history as I did there and 
actually standing at a point where 
something happened.”

Anumber of  newly admitted freshmen gathered alongside returning Tritons in Warren Mall on Sept. 21 for the 
A.S. All-Campus Dance. The event, which ran 
from 8 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., was free for all 
UCSD students and featured the disc jockey 
handiwork of  Miss Lisa. The All-Campus 
Dance is one of  the first events in a series 
of  social outings on and off  campus for 

new students, put together 
by various depar tments 
and collectively held under 
the Welcome Week banner.

• “Love is Noise”

Department of Eagles
• “In Ear Park”
• “No One Does It Like You”

T he weekend music festival is a dream come true on shiny brochure paper: All your favorite bands and all those 
you’ve been meaning to get to know, all 
checked off your must-see-live list, for a 
price far less than the sum of twenty-odd 
nighttime concerts. But a few hours into the 
fantasy and its rosy sheen starts to wear a 
little thin — legs hurt, everyone’s playing at 
once, thirsty, tall person in front, not high 
anymore, etc. Not to mention many nor-
mally stellar live performers tend to slack 
off a little with the comfort blanket that 
there’s a dozen more of the world’s finest 
acts following right behind, ready to pick up 
their slack.

But there’s also something about this 
man-made phenomenon — a coming 
together of so many bodies and sounds 
and genres and lights — that leaves in 
its wake a specially layered euphoria, a 
sense of having witnessed something weird 
and unrepeatable. San Diego’s Street Scene 
2008, recently having crawled from the 
grimy, far-out sidewalks of Adam’s Avenue 
and spread itself into the vast Petco park-
ing lot downtown, was a glorious adven-
ture in hot pavement and tramp stamps, 
drawing the inner scenester out of every 
last beach bum and university bro for a 
devilishly trashy garden party you’d be 
unlikely to find any other place on Earth.

Friday started up hot and sticky with a cheerful round of local 
bands: The Beck-shrining Muslims hacksawed at garage guitars 
until their polos were good and damp, while the electronic border 
boys of Nortec Collective ripped us from late-afternoon siesta with 
a techno-mariachi shot straight to the brain. As the San Diego 
trolley rattled by Street Scene’s epic row of porta-potties to stage 
right, and Petco’s concrete desert stretched below, the collective’s 
two front-nerds proved that MacBooks aren’t just for white kids 
anymore and that the mindfuck of a Tijuana intersection can 
somehow be captured in a poppy, screeching harmonica loop.

SCENESTREET

NORTEC COLLECTIVE

The surreal head-blanket of 
Radio cultsters was almost spec-
tacle enough to keep even Wu-
Tang die-hards from heading 
over to GZA, where they ended 
up having to chant him out of the 
tour bus for at least 15 minutes of 
a mere 45-minute set. 

But it wouldn’t be Wu with-
out a little fashionable lateness, 
and the Genius more than made 
up for his bad manners over that 
slow and steady music-box beat, 
rapping out the entirety of 1995 
masterpiece Liquid Swords as if 
locked in conversation.

GZA

Beck just might be the coolest man 
alive — however, it would take a god to 
overcome the fried Barbie hair, the sea 
of soothing backup singers and enough 
big-band, bright-light drama to erase all 
memories of that shaggy, ramblin’ guero.

BECK
Not barely had the Nortec accordian ceased its yowl that the 
crowd was already mobbing MGMT’s psychedelic set across the 
lot, blowing bubbles and throwing somewhat anticlimactic fist-
fuls of glitter at the sluggish, probably zonked, yet ever-adorable 
kidz-boppers onstage. After three or four tracks that would best 
be described as not “Time to Pretend,” the East Coast fivesome 
finally threw their sexed-up minions the radio darling they’d 
been waiting for, then drove the long-toured set home to the 
tune of “Kids” — but not without a round of beers and a silly 
little dance party with the fog machine set to inundate.

MGMT

Just as Diplo bowed out with the phlegm-loosening “Paper 
Planes,” giant Street Scene draw TV On the Radio stormed the 
main stage, wiggly frontman Tunde Adebimpe howling to a 
glowing stayclassy.com balloon overhead — backed by drum 
circles, saxophones and gospel peels to send the spirits reeling. 

But the real party was 
over at Diplo, where the 
spread-armed turntablist 
and sometimes M.I.A. 
producer enhanced a 
hundred Ecstasy trips and 
fogged a hundred more 
pairs of thick-rimmed 
Ray Bans, blaring a hip-
pop collage hot enough 
to lure even the most 
stubborn indie snob into 
a brimming alleyful of 
bump ‘n’ grind.

DIPLO

TV ON THE RADIO

Just-as-danceable Vampire 
Weekend a few sidestreets 
over made a profound 
improvement on their 
somewhat flat record 
persona, channeling Paul 
Simon himself with cutesy 
Graceland rhythms and 
tinkering around with 
“Little Mermaid” island 
congos for the most kickin’ 
study party on the lot.

VAMPIRE
WEEKEND

Those still feeling frisky from the 
Diplo crowd jumped right back 
in where they left off to the laser 
beams and deathly deep beats of 
French house duo Justice, who 
faded from Uffie girls-night-
out anthem “The Party” to the 
outsider electronica of “Never 
Be Alone” to feverish cut-and-
pastes of every last pulse of 
their worshipped repertoire. 

JUSTICE

Keeping the good times a tad simpler, the Canadian dudes 
(and one pretty Minnie, pounding on the keyboard) of the 
New Pornographers used a prime falling-dusk slot to their 
advantage, beaming primary-colored lights atop the clear, 
strong indie pop they’ve so come to own.

NEW PORNOGRAPHERS

The Scene Team douches 
soon swept GZA offstage to 
mortally paw at the magnificent 
instruments of next-up 
DeVotchKa, including an electric 
mandolin, stand-up bass and 
giant brass tuba wound in twinkly 
lights — tools more than suiting 
the romantic, dinner-jacketed 
quartet, a former burlesque 
band rooted in their famously 
fantastic live show. Though a 
well-intentioned double-mic 
setup somewhat thinned the 
soaring, wine-treated vocals of 
lead singer/stomper Nick Urata, 
his classical players more than 
filled the hollow as wisps of violin 
bow were lost to the breeze and 
the piercing shriek of brass horn 
sliced the dark.

TECHNO TO FIRE UP
 ‘LOFT-OFF’

by SONIA MIND
EN

GUARDIAN: How have Mexican audiences responded 
to nortec as a representation of Tijuana’s cultural 
fusion, and how has it been received worldwide?

NORTEC COLLECTIVE: We’ve been working with 
[each other] for nine years, playing everywhere in 
Mexico — from small clubs to huge Mexico City 
venues with 40,000 people. It started in Tijuana, 
where the collective was very huge, and people 
understood the fusion that we were doing. Nortec 
is stranger in Europe, where they thought we were 
doing mariachi music. But we spent 50 days there 
layering different live elements and … graphics, 
and they started to understand what nortec was 
all about.

It’s very strange to go to Morocco or Turkey or 
the United States, to bring Tijuana to those ven-
ues … in video and texture, to show the border 
influence, blending all these sounds so people can 
listen to our music and dance to our music and 
experience Tijuana as we do. The graphic elements 
are just as important; only a few tracks [from our 
albums] have lyrics, but we speak to the people 
through graphics, communicating what we think of 
being Tijuana residents.

G: What is it about Tijuana’s border culture that 
provides such an inspiration for you?  

NC: We were doing electronic music before, and 
we were very influenced by the United States and 
Europe. Before nortec it sounded like we were an 
electronic band from Europe or the United States 
— but when we started blending this sound from 
the border, we started to put all these cultural 
stamps on our music. Then, a lot of artists from 
Tijuana like painters, graphic designers and art 
installers — started to take notice, and the collec-
tive was born. They were reflecting Tijuana and 
beyond. 

And we have a means to do that. Tijuana is a 
very new city that doesn’t have its own culture at 
all. More than half of the people living in Tijuana 
are not from Tijuana; they were born in other 
states and Mexico and … brought all this culture 
from their own places of origin. The American 
culture is also very present here. 

Nortec Collective grabs from these experiences 
and builds something [in which] people can recog-
nize Tijuana. Finally we have something that can 
sound like the border.

SCENE

VAMPIRE
WEEKEND

I f you’re scoping out the year’s next hipster magnet, point those Frye boots to the the Loft, a brand-
spanking-new nightclub in the Price 
Center expansion — complete with 
gallery lighting, a retro-chic iTunes 
jukebox and tapas all around. Its kick-
off (er, “Loft-Off”) catchphrase gives 
fair warning: Students, “prepare to be 
lifted.” 

Whether that’s a spiritual caveat or a 
means of escape from the pits of social 
deficit, the lounge space certainly holds 
promise for those craving culture-shock 
therapy — or maybe just the occasional 
wine tasting. 

The Loft-Off festival will highlight 
the first of what will (hopefully) spur 
a much-needed tradition of campus 
cool, with live performances ranging 
from Bay Area indie-rockers Rogue

JUSTICE

Wave to the sultry boho cabaret of 
Vagabond Opera. Also on the bill are 
selections from this year’s San Diego 
Asian Film Festival, and oddball 
improv from the Upright Citizens 
Brigade comedy troupe. 

We were fortunate enough to long-
distance dial Pepe Mogt of Nortec 
Collective, The Loft’s premiering 
headliner. Named for its fusion of 
norteño folk and traditional techno, 
the collective shares a passion for 
enlightening clubs worldwide with 
their musical snapshots of Tijuana 
flavor. And judging from Nortec’s 
performance at San Diego’s Street 
Scene, the team of musicians, 
producers, and graphic designers will 
likely inspire us kids to dance like we 
were border-hopping. 



16  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

One of my favorite personali-ties in video-game journalism recently made the jump from 
editorial to development. While I’m 
more than happy that such an intel-
ligent mind has the chance to finally 
exercise its creativity and knowledge 
on the other side of the industry, I’d 

be lying if I said I wasn’t saddened by 
the fact that I would no longer read 
any of his articles or sit in on any of 
his enjoyable podcasts. The journal-
ist in question is Shawn Elliott, and 
he will now be working at 2K Boston 
alongside Ken Levine, the acclaimed 
creator of the critically and commer-
cially successful game BioShock.

I suppose it might seem amateur 
of me to praise a journalist in my 
own column, but I find it difficult to 
acknowledge my integrity as a writer 
without expressing a bit of hero wor-
ship for Elliott.  

While I admit that I’m more a 
fan of his radio personality than his 
writing, I’ve always been enamored 
with his intellect, the common link 
between these two aspects of the 
enthusiast press. Elliott’s analysis of 
design in popular games has always 
been a subject of fascination for me, 
and, to be honest, a lot of my own cri-
tiques regarding the topic of gaming 
in general can be attributed to him.

Unlike many other journalists 
in the industry, Elliott has a knack 
for identifying design flaws in seem-
ingly perfect games. Most recently, 
when Metal Gear Solid 4 was finally 
released and many gaming outlets 
were praising the accomplishments 
of the much-anticipated title, Elliott 
was one of few who acknowledged the 
ambitions of creator Hideo Kojima 
and criticized his failures, specifi-
cally in the conflict between Kojima’s 
desire to philosophically explore the 
interactivity between player and game 
(or person and the machine) and his 
desire to create an experience that is 
both enjoyable and appeasing to the 
mass public.  

His brutally honest criticism of 
the title helped me break down my 
own bias for the franchise and begin 
to laugh at the often ridiculous design 
elements that were illuminated by his 
insight.

What Elliott consistently did for 
me was question the significance of 
a video game. As gamers, we’re living 
in an age where creativity in high-
production games is floundering and 
where independent gaming is allowing 
creative individuals to manipulate cli-
ched gaming conceits. As such, more 
and more games are clearly pushing

Kenny G
HUMPHREY’S CONCERTS BY THE BAY 

SEPT. 25 / 8 P.M. / $70 ($599 WITH ROOM)

Let’s talk about sax. Start your school year at UCSD 
right with the smoothest jazz in the universe, delivered to 
you by curly-haired saint Kenny G, a man who knows his 
saxophone all too well. G-man will surely play his greatest 
gems for the San Diego crowd, from the transporting 
bliss of “Songbird” to the aerobic ecstasy of “Slip of the 
Tongue.” He may even whip out the Christmas hits a little 
early, drawing upon  nostalgic renditions of such classics 
as “Winter Wonderland” and “Little Drummer Boy.” Bring 
a new friend from campus and let the power of Kenny 
expand your souls. (CK)

“Mister Foe” 
HILLCREST LANDMARK / SEPT. 23-25 / 7:20 P.M. / $10.50

Arriving at the Hillcrest Cinemas is “Young Adam” director 
David Mackenzie’s “Mister Foe”, redolent with Freudian subtexts and 
Hitchcockian murder mystery. The Scottish film’s gothic-lite comedic 
vein caters to an audience unafraid to face unsettling issues that lie 
beneath delightfully whimsical wrapping. The voyeuristic habits of 
leading teen loner Jamie Bell (“Billy Elliot”) reveal desires as peculiar 
as his eccentric personality. If Michael Haneke directed “Napoleon 
Dynamite” and set it to Franz Ferdinand, you can guess it would be 
opening this week at the Landmark Theaters. (EG)

Department of Eagles
■ In Ear Park
4AD

B efore Grizzly Bear broke out their Animal Collective-at-half-speed pop, another proj-ect existed named Department of Eagles, 
composed of GB singer/guitarist Daniel Rossen 
and his buddy Fred Nicolaus. Their resulting 
In Ear Park is a pained confessional nearly four 
years in the making, more hook-oriented than 
GB and just as warm-blanket attractive. Instead 
of lingering on a twangy breakdown for a few 
minutes before returning to the safety of a verse, 
Department of Eagles embrace the pleasures of 
pop structure, then fill it with old-timey finger-
picking and polish it with subtle tech sheen. What 
may at first sound like your grandaddy’s folk 
music is merely a hybrid designed with classical 
beauty in mind, sometimes taking new strides 
into the organic territory Radiohead explored last 
year with In Rainbows.

Opener “In Ear Park”  enters slowly, but when 
the drums and backing vox find their way inside 
the room, the dynamics shift from front-porch 
plucking to the expanse of an ecstatic concert hall. 
More immediate are the bent chords and animal 

bass of straight-up nodder “No One Does It Like 
You,” whose circus percussion would do well lead-
ing a full-blown hippie parade. Nicolaus takes 
vocal duties on piano ballad “Teenagers,” a late-
Beatles homage with an assortment of wind and 
string instruments all properly treated with lo-fi 
varnish. The droll and trying “Classical Records,” 
however, pairs instantly forgettable melodies with 
ridiculous metaphors about bummed LPs sleeping 
in their sleeves — through which, fortunately, the 
gorgeous orchestration never falters. 

Department of Eagles prove to be catchier 
and more creatively focused than their much-
blogged brethren before them. Indie music as 
most people know it has garnered its own worn 
genre trademarks over the years, and while the 
Dept. fit into many of these categories super-
ficially, their nuanced and old-soul approach 
to familiar instruments saves them from the 
pigeonhole.

Abe Vigoda
■ Skeleton
POST PRESENT MEDIUM

F ollowing the lead of the Smell’s stalwart acts No Age and Health, the suburban kids of Abe Vigoda (yes, like that old cheep from “The 
Godfather”) finally live up to their Net hype with 
Skeleton, a collection of tracks they’ve been playing 
in shoddy L.A. haunts for years. 

The Vigoda boys have kept their big break local, 
releasing the work on Post Present Medium, a label 
associated with the L.A. indie scene and headed 
by No Age drummer Dean Spunt. Abe’s stylistics 
run the gamut, culminating in tropical punk and 
goaded by noisy chanting. On “Bear Face,” lead 
singer Michael Vidal drives home his portents, 
repeating “When I found you, you had given up/ 
You will bare the face of me” ad nauseum until dis-
pelling into chattery chord strums and snare blasts. 
But because the band uses these jaunty guitar tones 
and irreverent percussion for the majority of their 
songs, a cursory listen could leave you inundated 
and perhaps underwhelmed. 

The jerky tempo changes and steel drum sound-
alike guitars of “Dead City/Waste Wilderness” may 
bear initial similarities to “World Heart”’s cowbell-

infused rhythm and bubbly low-end, but after you 
become familiar with Skeleton’s puzzling methods, 
the hooks emerge as if they had always been there 
all along, just waiting to be found.

To build a more cohesive and intricate album 
along with segueing between twacked-out pop, the 
boys enhance their set with a few noise interludes. 
“Whatever Forever” assaults us with condensed 
white feedback for less than a minute, and spastic 
“Animal Ghosts” takes off from there, catching us 
off guard. 

The comparatively ambient “Visi Rings” bor-
rows from No Age’s playbook and serves as an 
introspective smoking break for both band and 
listener, preparing us for the last two tracks on 
the record. While it may not be the most carefully 
crafted album of the year, Skeleton’s songs reach 
new heights of punk creativity and find untapped 
energy outside the cramped confines that postur-
ing will allow.

Bloc Party
■ Intimacy
WICHITA

recordings

A n off-the-c h a r t s freshman 
album can sky-
rocket a band  
from garage to 
glory, but sadly for this pub-crawling 
quartet, their smashing debut was no 
free ride. Two albums later, Bloc Party’s 
refusal to be typecast pushes them even 
further from a once-promised fame.

At least there’s one constant in 
Bloc Party’s ever-wavering style: lead 
singer Kele Okereke’s love quarrel. But 
heartache is not the only motif gluing 
Intimacy’s head-bobbers to melancholy 
lullabies. Greek myth is also thrown into 
the mix — in divinely adorned singles 
“Mercury” and the gothic “Zepherus,” 
monastery chants are shadowed in a 
choir of chills. Only when the open-mic 
poet lets out his trademark wail of a 
lover’s lament do we remember that this 
is, after all, the same old Bloc Party. 

Though risk-taking should be cred-
ited where due, the sweet wind chimes 
of “Signs” can’t keep the plucks and 
prods of “Trojan Horse” from beat-
ing listeners with its tortutous ferocity, 
and scratchy marching band recordings 
with blatant lyrics like “I’m sitting in 
Soho trying to stay drunk” are cause 
for concern. 

But the most disappointing void in 
Intimacy is its absolute lack of dance-
ability. By straying from their trade-
mark disco-ready bounce, fans are now 
left with cuts such as the obnoxious 
“Ares,” a stain of video-game beeps and 
migraine-inducing sirens, or polar-
opposite “Biko,” an emotional Coldplay 
ripoff. “One Month Off” best captures 
the band’s happy medium with choppy 
lyrics and a toe-tapping beat, but for 
those who kept their fingers tightly 
crossed that Bloc Party would resurrect 
its glory days, Intimacy is hardly the 
answer to their prayers.

The Verve
■ Forth
RED

A u t u m n rhythms, intoxicated 
i n s t r u m e n t s 
and somber 
vocals mark the 
Verve’s newfound experimentalism on 
Forth, a year’s worth of collected sound 
bytes and synthesized strings. Since the 
band’s drug-induced breakup in 1999, 
lead singer Richard Ashcroft’s solo flop 
has necessitated an epic reunion record 
— unsurprisingly, one that stays faith-
ful to the astral textures and avant-
garde ambitions of so many fashionable 
British bands, like themselves.

Nearly every note sustains its pitch 
until it fades, a numbing convolution 
played out in natural timber — organ-
ic, inchoate and often discordant in 
its layering. “Rather Be” and “Sit and 
Wonder” are cuckolded ballads chan-
nelling Ashcroft’s turbulent mental state, 
laconic narratives strewn atop similarly 
chaotic instrumentals. For the Verve, a 
sprawling symphony can make even a 
papercut lovely and profound.

Nick McCabe’s guitar riffs take a 
willful turn toward mainstream Britpop, 
drowned in shoegazing, over-blurred 
artistry. While the band’s new-wave 
sensibilities do a few tracks well (notably 
“Valium Skies” and “I See Houses”), the 
psychedelic hypersensitivity to sound 
generally saturates the record in surplus 
strumming and normalized originality. 
The Verve’s affection for melody from 
noise — all billowing horns and eupho-
nious echoes — is the extent of their 
experiment.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  23

boundaries and challenging players 
to think beyond the controller. Look 
no further than independent gaming 
posterboy Braid to understand exactly 
what I mean. By analyzing a game like 
Braid, questioning the intent of the 
creator and treating any given title as 
a legitimate form of art, Elliott taught 
me to look beyond the status quo of 
video games and appreciate subtleties 
that separate the good games from 
the great.  

In hindsight, I suppose Elliott was 
better suited for development than 
journalism. While his acute ability 
to mock ridiculous notions of gam-
ing, technical or cultural, provided 
a great source of enjoyment for the 
reader, his keen sense of design wasn’t 
suited for the enthusiast press. While 
I’ll truly miss his weekly antics on the 
GFW Radio Podcast, I certainly look 
forward to the game he’ll develop 
with Levine, a title I imagine will be 
a topic of great discussion come the 
next several years.

As I sit here and write this tribute 
to a personal hero who’s helped me 
more fully appreciate the games I’ve 
come to love, I can only wonder if 
others have ever put the same sense 
of significance on the games they play 
as I have.  As a story-telling medium, 
I’ve been touched, enlightened and 
humored by the games that reach 
my fingertips, and as a platform of 
pleasure, I’ve been gratified in more 
ways by video games than anything 
else I’ve come in conact with (you best 
believe it).  

So, as I finish up my little love 
letter, I ask you a question that Elliot 
first inspired me to ask myself: What 
meaning do games have for you?  
What elements of a game make it fun, 
and why are they important? What 
compels you to boot up a game and 
just sit there and play? 

G: Tijuana Sessions 3, your latest 
album, earned mass critical acclaim, 
including a Latin Grammy nomi-
nation. Did you ever anticipate this 
level of success when making your first 
nortec mixes?

NC: In our goals, we never think 
about the Grammys. It’s good that 
they nominated us — but it’s nothing 
that we were looking for. Maybe for 
us, it’s like, all right that the industry at 
that level has already noticed nortec, 
but we never wanted a Grammy.

G: What electronica artists have influ-
enced the Nortec Collective?

 
NC: It depends what we are listen-
ing to at the moment. A lot of the 
music is norteño; the techno side of 
nortec has been influenced by music 
from the United States and Europe. 
Sometimes new bands have influ-
enced us, but mostly bands from the 
’80s and even ’60s. Maybe it sounds 
strange, but we are influenced by, 
like, the Moody Blues. Does it have 
anything to do with electronic music? 
Maybe not. But we are influenced by 
New Order, and other rock music. 
[We aren’t influenced by] a specific 
band — there are too many things 
going on, too many bands to mention 
all of them.

ing critical moments of the race.
“I try to get a good start and 

start out fast,” she said. “I try to 
carry that momentum as far as I 
possibly can.” 

Paralleling the women’s strong 
performance, the men’s team pulled 
a first-place victory, with five of 
the Tritons finishing within the 
top 10 at the men’s 8,000-meter 
event.  Leading the Triton victors 
was senior Jake LeVieux, seven sec-
onds shy of first with a time of 
25:32. Following suit came senior 
Gabe LaMothe at 26:15, junior Max 
Mullender at 26:40 and junior Jesse 
Morrill at 26:41, earning fourth, 
sixth and seventh place respectively. 
Freshman John Svet tailed the pack 
with a time of 26:48.  

According to LeVieux, his suc-
cess as a harrier can be attributed 
to an unwavering focus and strong 
mindset.

“Basically I’m just struggling 
with myself to keep the pace,” he 
said. “Early in the race it’s not that 
bad.  With running you pretty much 
have to fight yourself in a way; you 
have to choose to hurt for a little 
longer, and you have to be strong 
mentally.”

UCSD emerged from the races 
with solid team scores. The women 
received a total of 30 points, which 
put the Tritons 33 points ahead of 
second-place Cal Poly Pomona. The 
men’s team totaled 29, which sur-
passed Cal Poly Pomona by a 14-
point margin. 

“I was really proud of how our 
athletes performed today,” head 
coach Nate Garcia said. “It was 
really great to see them reap the 
rewards of all the hard work they’ve 
been putting in during the year.”

Garcia, who is entering his sec-
ond year as head coach, took both 
teams to the NCAA Division-II 
National Championships last sea-
son. His goals include building 
upon the team’s history of top rank-
ings. 

“The program’s whole goal is to 
elevate ourselves to have the best 
year in Division II,” Garcia said. 
“We hope to continue to take steps 
this year and to finish higher at the 
national level, as well as to improve 
our standings from last year.”  

The course at Glen Helen 
Regional Park will serve as the site 
for the conference championships 
scheduled on Oct. 25 — a notewor-
thy leg up for the Tritons.

“It was a big advantage to have the 
opportunity to race on this course,” 
Garcia said. “However, there will 
be many schools during the CCAA 
[Conference Championship] that 
were not present today and that we 
have not raced against before so 
we will have our work cut out for 
us. But it’s good for our athletes 
to see the course and not have to 
worry as much as to what is going 
to be around the corner or the next 
hill.”

Off to an impressive start, the 
runners are keeping their sights set 
on nationals. 

“It’s definitely a special year for 
all the seniors and myself because 
we’re all working the hardest we 
can,” LeVieux said. “While confer-
ence is important, I would say our 
bigger goal awaits us at [the NCCA 
West Regional]. That is really spe-
cial to us because schools from all 
over will come to compete with us 
at home. Regionals are where we 
qualify to go to nationals and that 
is what makes it special.”  

After winning the second of just 
three events so far this season and 
with such a stacked roster to carry 
them on, UCSD seems well on its 
way to a recored-breaking 2008.

to sweep five games on their trip to 
New Jersey.

“Any time you travel to the East 
Coast, it’s not real easy to win back 
there,” Harper said. “We were com-
posed and didn’t overreact to the 
referees.”

UCSD earned a hard-fought vic-
tory over No. 20 Princeton University 
by a score of 11-9 before dominat-
ing George Washington University, 
Iona College and Johns Hopkins 
University, then closed out the trip 
with a 9-6 victory over No. 11 Naval 
Academy. 

“Frankly, in the three middle 
games, we out-swam the other teams 
and scored goals off of turnovers,” 
Harper said. 

UCSD fared well in the Pacific 
NorCal  Tournament in Stockton on 
Sept. 20-21, although not as well as 
they hoped. The Tritons opened the 
tournament with their second loss 
to Cal State Long Beach by a score of 
10-7 before winning their final three 
games.

With the addition of seniors 
Jerkovic and Kotanjian, the Tritons 
hope to improve on last season’s fin-
ish in the WWPA Championships. 
After suffering a tough 11-10 loss to 
Air Force Academy in the opening 
round, UCSD was unable to place in 
the top four and had to settle for a 
fifth-place finish.

UCSD is currently ranked sec-
ond in the WWPA behind Loyola 
Marymount University, the team the 
Tritons will face at home on Thursday 
night and the defending WWPA 
champions. 

“There’s nothing else we expect 
but a win to show our fans,” Jerkovic 
said. “LMU is our biggest competi-
tion — we’re ranked second behind 
them [in the WWPA]. They’re the 
only team standing in our way.”

The Tritons hope their early suc-
cess will continue as the schedule 

grows tougher. After facing LMU, 
they will play Cal State Long Beach 
for the third time this season and No. 
7 UC Irvine.

“I’m not surprised by how we’ve 
been playing,” Harper said. “I knew 
we would definitely be improved 

over last season. We’re stoked about 
how things have gone so far but we 
have some tough games ahead of 
us.”

early season success to the players’ 
willingness to give their all on a daily 
basis.

“The guys have been eager 
to learn and listen and have given 
strong efforts in both training and 
games,”  Pascale said. “They have 
really focused on taking the season 
day by day and hold themselves to a 
pretty high standard on and off the 
field.”

In addition, Pascale credited his 
defense with 
making goals 
few and far 
between for 
opponents.  

“Our biggest 
reason for suc-
cess on the field 
has been our 
defending as we 
have only given 
up two goals so 
far this season,” 
he said.  “All 
of our defend-
ers and [senior 
goalkeeper] Peter Akerman have 
done a really great job holding teams 
down.”

Finally, Pascale highlighted his 
team’s selflessness as a key part of the 
formula for forward-moving suc-
cess.

“We play a lot of guys and cer-
tainly everybody would prefer to 
get more minutes, but they have all 
accepted their roles and give their 
best when they are in there,”  Pascale 
said. “We have had some guys go 
down and have been forced to play 
young and inexperienced players and 
they have picked up right where the 
other guys left off.”  

The Tritons hope to benefit from 
a wealth of experience as they return 
with 10 starters from last year’s squad, 

which finished the season 5-9-3 over-
all and 4-6-2 in division play. Their 
defense will again be a strong point, 
led by star net-minder Akerman, who 
made second team All-CCAA, and 
sophomore defender Jared Kukura, 
a CCAA honorable mention as a 
freshman.

On the offensive side of the ball, 
the Tritons will stick with junior 
forward Tony Choi, who finished 
second on the team in points with 
nine last year. Choi said he agrees 

that the team’s 
experience will 
allow it to take 
the next step 
this year.

“Last year 
we had a really 
young team and 
now a lot of guys 
have more expe-
rience,” Choi 
said. “I think we 
all work a little 
harder now.”

Choi said he 
was impressed 

with Pascale thus far and believes the 
first-year coach has what it takes to 
build a winning lineup.

“He has been fantastic and he real-
ly seems to know what he is doing,”  
Choi said.  “He is really encouraging 
and knows how to motivate us.”

While Pascale tried to temper 
expectations for the season, Choi did 
not hesitate to set his sights on the 
ultimate prize.

“The goal is the same every year,” 
he said. “We want to go as far as we 
can and win the national title.”

If the young season is any indica-
tion, that dream may not be so far 
out of reach.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
UCSD women’s volleyball team had 
high expectations heading into the 2008 
season. In its 2007 campaign, the Tritons 
were ranked in Division-II’s top 25 
through all 28 games. In the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association rank-
ings, UCSD tied for second and boasted 
an impressive 13-5 conference record. 
While many teams would have been 
satisfied to settle for such levels of suc-
cess, the Tritons, under the direction 
of fourth-year head coach Tom Black, 
have worked harder than ever in the 
off-season to achieve even greater 
results this year.  

Senior All-American and team cap-
tain Rebecca Bailey said she feels that 
the team has the talent and the work 
ethic to bring home the D-II champion-
ship trophy.  

“Our team goal is to win nationals,” 
Bailey said. “I’m sure that every team 
says that, but we’ve done the work; 
we’ve put in a lot of extra hard work. 
We might not have the height that other 
teams do, but we have the heart and a 
work ethic that no other team does. We 
know that we can go all the way.”

Though the Tritons lost three of six 
starters from last year’s squad, 10 letter-
winners returned and, with a promising 
crop of recruits and the developing tal-
ent of several underclassmen, they seem 
poised to make a run for the title.  Bailey 
pointed out that although they appear 
young, the newcomers fit settled right 
in and are already excelling.  

“It doesn’t even feel like we are a 
young team,” Bailey said. “In my 

opinion, this is the most mature team 
I’ve been on yet, and that’s surprising 
because there is a lot of youth on the 
squad.”

Junior outside hitter Karen Reis feels 
that team unity is their strength, as even 
the most inexperienced team members 
challenge each other to do their best.

“There is nonstop competition dur-
ing practices for every single position,” 
Reis said.  “Everyone has the potential 
to play and excel in matches, and this 

is a huge strength because we all push 
each other to be better.  It also prepares 
us for the competition during games 
that much more.”

The No. 18 Tritons opened their 
season with a tough matchup against 
No. 1 Concordia University on Aug. 29. 
In a hard-fought struggle, UCSD lost 
the first set, but came back to win the 
second and nearly the third before the

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  27

Golden Bears took control of the set 
and ultimately the game. Despite the 
setback, the Tritons bounced back in 
their second game of the season to 
defeat No. 25 Lewis University, the 
first of six straight wins, which includ-
ed a victory over No. 24 Brigham 
Young University-Idaho.  

In its conference opener, UCSD 
suffered from a slow start and 
dropped all three sets to the Golden 
Eagles from Cal State Los Angeles. 
Due to the loss, the Tritons dropped 
to 6-2, 0-1 CCAA.  Yet the Tritons 
again showed resilience, springing 
back to take down conference foes 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State 
Monterey Bay and San Francisco 
State without losing a set.  

Up against the Toros of Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, the Tritons demon-
strated why CCAA coaches predicted 
them to be the conference’s number-
two team in a preseason poll. Using 
their depth of talent to experiment 
with several different lineups, UCSD 
held Cal State Dominguez Hills to a 
0.000 hitting percentage, served nine 
aces and saw eight separate players 
record kills. The use of different line-
ups highlighted the team’s versatility, 
including redshirt freshman defensive 
specialist Roxanne Brunsting, who 
had a standout game with 10 digs, 
and sophomore middle blocker Kaitlin 
Potter, who recorded three blocks.  

In their next game, the 18th-ranked 
Tritons handled Cal State Monterey 
Bay by winning three straight sets 25-
17, 25-20, 25-16. Bailey led the way 
with a match-high 14 kills against the 
Otters, while freshman outside hit-
ter Hillary Williamson stepped up to 
deliver 12 kills. Freshman setter Thalia 
McCann, who saw her first consider-
able playing time and took advan-
tage of the opportunity, recorded 39 
assists, five digs and two blocks.  

To complete their three-game win-
ning streak, the Tritons took down 
San Francisco State in a Sept. 20 road 
game. UCSD continued its solid streak, 
boasting a 0.275 hitting percentage and 
holding San Francisco State to 0.133.  
Distinguishing herself as one of the 
country’s premier outside hitters, Bailey 
hit 0.458 with 12 kills while junior out-
side hitter Sylvia Schmidt added nine. 

Williamson also maintained a strong 
serve, delivering four of the Tritons’ 
10 aces.  

From the games they’ve had so far, 
the Tritons have determined that they 
have the potential and the mindset to 
win it all — they’ll just need to come 
gametime.

“We’re starting to put everything 
together little by little and making it 
happen,” Bailey said. “We are the team 
that is going to get there. We love com-
petition — that’s what we work so hard 
for.

After some early season success, the 
Tritons are confident about reaching 
their goal, but trying not to become 
overconfident. Reis believes that the 

team has the right attitude to bring 
home the championship.  

“We treat every point the same, 
no matter if we are winning or los-
ing,” Reis said.  “We prepare for each 
point the same, take each match and 
each game the same.  It really keeps us 
grounded.”

With their latest victory, the No. 18 
Tritons improved to an impressive 9-2, 
3-1 in the CCAA. They return to action 
on Sept. 26, when they will host the 
undefeated and top-ranked Cal State 
San Bernardino at 7 p.m. in RIMAC 
Arena.

sent Delmon Young, Brendan Harris 
and Jason Pridie to the Twins for Jason 
Bartlett, Matt Garza and Eduardo 
Morlan.

Finally, the front office that brought 
Kazmir to the glorious Tropicana Field 
struck gold a second time with rookie 
Evan Longoria, who earned a spot on 
the all-star team 
in his first major-
league season and 
has started 110 
games for the 
Rays. 

Despite all the 
success, Tampa 
Bay has struggled 
of late, only pull-
ing an 8-11 record 
in September, due 
in part to an inju-
ry-plagued roster. 
Still, overjoyed 
Rays fans have 
reason to believe 
Tampa Bay can keep up the magic.

They’ve fared well against the White 
Sox, taking six of 10 games in the regular 
season while winning six of nine against 
the Angels. A Boston and Tampa Bay 
match-up would be the most difficult 
for the Rays, as the two teams have held 
some hard-fought battles this season. 
(It would also be the most difficult 
series for Steinbrenner, who might keel 

over if forced to watch two AL East 
teams not named the Yankees play in 
the American League Championship 
Series.)

So where do the Yankees go from 
here? Next season they’ll move to the 
House that Steinbrenner Built after 
buying a few more players and bank-
ing on their proven stars, because that’s 

what the Yankees 
always do. 

Still, some-
thing strange is 
happening over 
there in the AL 
East. First, the 
curse on the Red 
Sox was bro-
ken. Then, the 
rolling-in-cash 
Yankees played 
out their last 
games in historic 
Yankee Stadium. 
Finally, the sec-
ond-to-last in 

payroll Rays made the playoffs for 
the first time in history. Some people 
might call it greater parity in baseball. 
As for me — self-respecting, Yankee-
hating baseball fan that I am — I call 
it justice.

HOT CORNER

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

MEN’S SOCCER — For the first time 
in 26 seasons, a new head coach 
has been stalking the sidelines at the 
UCSD men’s soccer games and the 
initial results have been extremely 
impressive.  New coach John Pascale 
has the Tritons off to a torrid start 
with five victories in as many matches 
as the experienced squad seeks to 
take the program to new heights.

The team began its campaign 
with home victories over University 
of Hawaii-Hilo, the University of 
Concordia and Cal State San Marcos, 
outscoring opponents by a margin 
of 6-1. The Tritons were then forced 
from the friendly confines of UCSD 
and hit the road to begin California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play 
with matches against San Francisco 
State and Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Sept. 12 and 14. Both matches were 
hard fought but the Tritons were able 
to dispatch their foes from the Bay 
Area by a score of 1-0 and the Otters 
of Monterey by 2-1.

Coaches around the country have 
been put on notice of the squad’s 
success as the Tritons have earned 
their first points in the Division-II 
National Soccer Coaches Association 
of America/Adidas national rank-
ings, finishing just outside the top 25.  
The Tritons are ranked fourth in the 
West portion of the same poll.

CROSS COUNTRY — UCSD’s cross 
country teams won their second 
victories of the season on Sept. 21 
when they traveled to Cal State 
San Bernardino to compete in the 
Coyote Invitational. The Triton har-
riers provided a compelling, if not 
dominating, presence at Glen Helen 
Regional Park, ultimately scoring 
first-place showings for both the 
men’s and women’s teams.
    Freshman sensation Bre Schofield 
demonstrated her powerful spirit 
when she seized first place in the 
women’s 6,000-meter run with a 
time of 22:09, which secured vic-
tory by an impressive 14-second 
margin. Schofield, who is no 
stranger to excellence, was named 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association female runner of the 
week just one week prior to the 
race.   

Equally notable are the team-
mates who joined Schofield in plac-
ing in the top 10 for the wom-
en’s event.  Clocking in at 23:17, 
23:42 and 23:46 respectively, 
seniors Amanda Keuhn, Ashleigh 
Montgomery and Jessica DiMascio 
contributed significantly to the 
team’s first-place finish as the run-
ners took third, sixth and eighth 
place respectively. According to 
team captain Montgomery, an excit-
ing start to the 2008 season is some-
thing she values highly and regards 
with pride.  

“Definitely as a senior, these 
[races] carry more weight because 
it’s the last time that I will compete 

at this level. [Cross country] has 
truly meant a lot to me over the 
years,” Montgomery said.

Montgomery attributes her 

prowess and success as a runner to 
her ability to think positively dur-

MEN’S WATER POLO — With their 
conference opener against chief 
rival No. 6 Loyola Marymount 
University quickly approaching, the 
No. 9 Tritons have good reason to 
feel optimistic about their chances 
in the game and the rest of the sea-
son. They have started off strong by 
winning 10 of their first 12 games, 
their young team is gaining experi-
ence and they have a seasoned coach 
who just earned his 500th career 
victory. 

The biggest reason for confi-
dence, however, is the return of 
two of UCSD’s best players from 
two seasons ago: senior driver 
Adnan Jerkovic and senior utility 
A.J. Kotanjian. The two seniors red-
shirted the entire 2007 campaign in 
order to play for the Tritons in their 
final season. 

“[Jerkovic and Kotanjian] are 
two of the best in our program,” 
head coach Denny Harper said. 
“Everybody else is back with anoth-
er year of experience.”

As juniors in 2006, Kotanjian and 
Jerkovic ranked second and third on 
the team in goals scored, respec-
tively. Jerkovic also led the team 

in assists with 65. The two seniors 
continued their steady goal streak 
early this season, and Jerkovic’s 14 
assists on the team’s trip to New 
Jersey helped him earn Western 
Water Polo Association player of 
the week honors. 

“It was a great honor and our 
conference has a lot of teams so it is 
a pretty huge thing,” Jerkovic said. 
“If you look at my stats, it’s because 

other guys are getting open, so I’m 
proud of our team.”

The Tritons have also had more 
solid play from their new starting 
goalkeeper, freshman David Morton. 
Last season, the Tritons used a trio 
of hit-or-miss goalies, never settling 
on one as the undisputed starter.  

“The goalie situation is a little 
more clear this year and we’re get-
ting better goalie play,” Harper said.

UCSD performed well in its early 
games, the only two losses coming 
at the hands of No. 8 Cal State Long 
Beach. The Tritons took three out of 
four games at the Triton Invitational 
to start the season, posting wins 
over No. 16 University of Redlands, 
No. 12 UC Davis and  UC Santa 
Barbara. The Tritons then went on 

If you go to the Tampa Bay Rays’ Web site, you’ll find ads all over your computer screen 
asking you to “Sign Up for the 
Opportunity to Purchase Rays 
Postseason Tickets.” Postseason  
— yes, as in playoffs. 

Those ads can mean only one 
thing. For the first time in their 
franchise’s history, the Tampa Bay 
Rays are in the playoffs — and the 
Yankees aren’t.

Let’s just take a moment and 
think about how ridiculous this 
is. How does a team that posted 
a major-league worst record last 
season clinch a playoff spot and, 
as I write this, hold a 2 1⁄2 game 
lead over the Boston Red Sox in 
the American League East? How 
have the Yankees, who have not 

missed the playoffs in 15 years, 
been reduced to merely playing out 
their final games in September? 

Like many, I saw that the Rays 
had been slowly improving, devel-
oping young talent and money-
balling their way to a pretty nice 
lineup with Scott Kazmir, a clear 
star, in their rotation. But not even 
when the Rays shocked baseball 
with their sweep over the Red Sox 
early this season, was I ready to 
jump on the bandwagon — mainly 
because I liked it better when they 
were called the D-Rays. 

But here we are, almost into 
October, and Tampa Bay is about 
to play its first postseason game 
ever. Meanwhile, the Yankees just 
played a meaningless final game in 
the House that Ruth Built and will 
be absent from the playoffs for the 
first time since 1993, a time when 
the Rays didn’t even exist.

So while Jeter and the rest of 
the pinstriped boys sip on their 
Hatorade and watch the postseason 
on their giant TV screens, the Rays 
will try to repeat what they’ve been 
doing all season — win ballgames. 

In 2007, the then D-Rays boast-
ed a young and potent offense, 
third in the AL in both home runs 
and stolen bases. It was a lieup 
backed by the resurgent Carlos 
Pena, who played only 18 games in 
2006 with the Red Sox. The Rays’ 
young lineup of Carl Crawford, BJ 
Upton and bat-throwing extraor-
dinaire Delmon Young kept the 
offense going.

The problem in 2007 for the D-
Rays was that they couldn’t get past 
the sixth inning, crumbling late in 
games and surprising no one with 
their major-league worst record. 

Over the offseason, the Rays 
took a page out of the Yankees’ 
gold-plated playbook and spent 
some money. Upping their pay-
roll from $24.1 million to a whop-
ping $43.8 million (about one-fifth 
of the Evil Empire’s payroll), the 
Rays extended the contracts of 
their young talent and signed free 
agents.

Shaking things up even more, 
the Rays made a giant trade that
