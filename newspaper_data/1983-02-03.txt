Berkeley - When the PhI 
Gamma Delta house here at 
the l ni\crsi ty of California 
held a "m ilitary brawl" one 
recent weekend, with fi\ e 
I equ i la ~hot s req u i rcd for 
admis<,J(JI1 and mock warfare 
parI of the fun, Keith Zafren 
~t aved awa". In~tead. he took a 
gll·j dancmg '50" "tyle at an off 
campu<, ballroom. Iil s fello\\' 
fraternity brother. Christ 

(,ood. spend the e\cning at a 
yuu th mim"try retreat. 

"The whole purpose of the 
fraternIty I~ straIght out of the 
BII>le," "nvs Good. "Chnstle\Jl 
brothers'II\' lng together. 
bUlldmg each other up In 
lhrJ"I." But Ihat high 
pUrp(N', he believes. has 
Lrumblec! to "drunken exce<,s 
and enjoyment." 

Good and Zaf ren ceased to 
partake of that sort of fun 
v.hen the\' disco\(~red that 
rt'ligion give" them more 

~atisfaction. Both are 
member~ of the Campus 
Crusade for Christ [nt erna-
tlOnal. Good say~ he sta ys on 
at the house "to be an example 
and offer others a place to turn 
to." His brothers are searching 
for what he feel s he has found: 
fulfIllment and happiness. He 
and Zafren lead a weekly BIble 
study group at the fraternity . 

Th two - both handsome, 
a thletic sons of well-educated 
famIlies are among 
thousands of similar tudents 
across the country who 
rece ntl y have turned to 
fundamentalist Chri tianity, 
convinced that they have 
found the answer to man' 
most profound questions and 
that their mo~t important ta sk 
is to go out and convert others 
to their beliefs. 

This campu ,famous as the 
seedbed of ocial nd political 
activi sm. now has Bible study 
groups III dormitories and 
residences and has been the 
rccent scene of big evangelistic 
gatherings put on by campus 
groups that include Campus 
Crusade for Christ . the 
Maranatha Ministries, and 
The Way International. 

The Crusade was founded 
by businessman Bill Bright al 
the Univer~ity of Southern 
California in 1953and now has 
1,400 fulltime staffers, eight of 
them on thi s campu~. 
Maranatha Ministries is 
es tablished on about 70 
campuses. and The Way. an 
Ohio-based group, has been 
desc ribed by some Christian 
leaders and cu It -\Va tchers as a 
destructive cult. ranking in 
size with the Church of 
Scientology and the Rev . Sun 
Myung Moon 's Unification 

Church, though it keeps a low 
profi le. 

Catholic and main<;tream 
Protestant churches also show 
growth on many campuses, as 
do ome JeWIsh organizatIOn s, 
particularly tho e that offer a 
close community. But the 
most dramatic gain ' are being 
made by newer group. that 
affiliate with no traditional 
faith s, put little stress on 
theology but much on fervor , 
and recruit aggress ive ly 
among students. 

These back -to- th e- Bibl e 
groups repre ent one of the 
mos t dynamic movements 
now on American campu es 
and are exerting con, iderable 
influence on univer 'ity life. 
They are strongest in the 
Midwest and the South . but 
also have taken hold in the 
Eastern Ivy League schools 
and in the West. 

Though in numbers this is a 
small movement compared to 
the anti-nuclear phenomenon . 
it draws power from the 
extraordinary per so nal 
commitment of its memb rs. 

tudents who join tend to 
make it the focu s of their li ves 
and the reference point for all 
activities. 

Maranatha members, for 
in s tance , speak of "total 
commitment" and shun close 
involvement with people who 
do not fit their definttion of 
Christian . They tend to Itve 
together in dormitories and 
apartments and relate to non-
members main Iy through

The ambitious US 
plan for education 
- a dead horse 

In the face of increasing costs at publicly-funded 
colleges and universities , the impending cutbacks in 
student financial aid will have an impact that goe far 
beyond whether or not today's students will be able to 
stay in school. The issue is not education per se, but 
the effect that a lack of education will have on the 
United States in coming years_ 

In the early part of this century. the U embarked 
on an ambitious plan for education on every level. an 
inve"tmenl that has paid off handsomely in both 
intellectual and industrial terms. Recently, however, 
education has become a favorite target for budget 
cutt ing efforts, and politicians seem to delight in the 
profuse bleedi ng of a once-sacred cow, 

The effects of this are both wide-reachmg and 
dangerous. On one hand, many studen ts will be 
forced outof the system, not only depriving them of an 
education but depriving the US of their potential. On 
the other hand , the long term effect on the economy 
will be di asterou , The administration is at once 
calling for high-technology industries to save the 
economy and depriving those industries of a properly 
educated work force to see it through. 

Those who will pay for this are not some 
amorphous "they"; "they" are us. When our class 
reaches middle age, we will be faced with an 
uneducated , uninformed populace, and those 
responsible will be long dead. 

The promise of better times and new 
"information-based" economy is as empty as the 
promise made in decades past with regards to an ever-
Improving educational system, The excitement 
generated by Washmgton rhetoric dies dov"n much 
more quickly than the excitement of what the future 
actually holds, we. today's students. will be at the 
reins. The question is: Will we be flogging a dead 
horse?

Women poorly represent themselves 
in radio broadcast debate 
Editor: 

This Sunday. I heard on the 
radio a debale \\ Ith the 
resoh'cd: 'Women ha\'e il at 
least as good a~ men.' William 
F, Buckley . Jr .. with a 
politician and a businessman 
(both male), defended the 
proposition, of course; two 
lawvers and a busine~sman 
(all -female) altacked it. 

The debate irritalcd and 
troubled me. Only Buckley 
was artlculatc and urbanc (his 
eloquence certaml) encour· 
age ... him in his closed 
mindt'dness; hm\ cou ld views 
l)l' \\ rung I ha tare "u pport ed 
by such \\,It~l. Buckle}'s 
associales were certainly 
unin:--pired. bUI Ihl' thrre 
women \\ ('ll' t'\'cn more 
disappoint mg, t hey were 
ignorant and thick-witted, 
clumw \\ hen cool and evcn 
mort' 'so when angry. 'I heIr 
speech \\ as The"aurus- and 
clichendden, their rea.,onlllg 
erratIc (un like Huckle~ ·s. 
which. though presuming on 
unt ruths. at leasl proceeded 
clearly to fabe conclUSion ... ). 
Each ~voman ga\'e sta Iisl ics 10 

show that women are 
relatively poor and materilllly 
suffering, to which Buckley 
was able to reply that women 
are "envied even'where" for 
the comforts the~' enjoy (I he 
traditional 'You have all these 
super scientific appliances to 
do your housework; be happy' 
argument), Buckley asked one 
of the lav.:yers. "wltCI/ will you 
have reached equality?" 
(echoes of Freud 's "What do 
women /{I(J/lI?") ; the lawver 
answered with be lli gerl'nl 
awkwardness that women 
would b· equal \\'lth men 

"when we have Ihethings that 
make life worth li\ing." 
Pressed. "he explallled that 
these thlllgs \\ere "a roof 0\ er 
your head, food. clothing .... " 
How "ti l,,! Why did ~heand her 
cO'panellsts 110t argue that 
women will'ha\'e it as good' as 
men when they can choose an\

Matenal securitv IS not libert\ 
(mistresses were kepI in ea"e 
and despised); (,'quality must

A Guardian recipe corner? The case against religion 
Editor: 

I am sure a majority of the 
population here at UC D 
appreciate your in, ight into 
the political. economic, and 
social aspects of our 
surroundings, but, I have 
found the newspaper to be 
lacking in se\ eral important 
aspects. One "uch quality is 
that the paper fails to inform 
on domestic matters. As a 
solution, [ would like to 
recommend instlgating a 
column devoted to cooking and 
the sharing of rE'cipes. For a 
large number of student s faced 
with preparing thei r own 
meals, it is a st ruggle to cr{'ate 
an appetizing dish. ThiS 
column cou ld help to alle\ iate 
this problem by providing a 
collection of easily prepared, 

• :s :."~. 

nutritious, inexpensive, yet 
tasty, recipes. The energy 
required to maintian such a 
column would be minimal once 
people began to submit their 
s uggestions and cont ribu · 
lions. r am sure many of us 
\\'ould appreciate your efforts.

By MARC KARLIN 
On Jan uary J9th , with a 

great deal of press coverage, 
Fed Koremat 'Ou filed a lawsuit 
against the United States 
C;o\'e rnment at the Federal 
District Court In San 
Francisco seeking to reversE' 
his 19<12 convict ion of violattrlg 
wart imc c\'acuation orders. 
The orders, issued by 
P residen t f{ oose\'e l tin 
February 19.+2, demanded that 
all Japarie~e·Americans on the 
West Coast be remm'ed from 
the general populatIOn and 
placed in relocation camps. 
The Pre"iclent undertook this 
action toquell thc public's fear 
that person's of Japaness 
heritage would assist the 
Japanese war effort by 
committing acts of espionage 
again"t the United States. 

Korematsu's first at tempt 
at erasing h is conviction ended 
thirty years ago when the 
Supreme Court ruled by a 
margin of 6-3 that the 
President was not acting 
unconstitutionally when he 
ordered the relocation . Mr. 
Koremat s u' s case was 
considered closed until Peter 
Irons, attorney and UCSD 
political science professor 
came upon some new evidence 
in 1981.

Professor Irons, who joined 
the political science depart-
ment faculty this year, was 
researching a book on the 
s ubject of Japanese intern-
ment cases when he came 
across ev idence dealing with 
Koremat s u, as well as 
Minouro Yasui and Gordon 
Hirabayashi, two other men 
convicted of relocation 
violations, that was never 
presented to the Supreme 
Court. 

since the go\'e rnment 
presented e\ id ence of 
disloyality among some 
Japanese-Americans it had the 
wartime power to relocate 
Japanese-Americans on the 
West Coast. Irons discovered , 
howeve r . that the Justice 
Department had evidence tha t 
japanes-Americans were not a 
threat to the security of the 
country. Report s of disloya lit y 
were exaggerated, and many 
Department reports were not 
presented fully to the Court. 
Thus Irons, -who had met 
Korematsu and the other men 
while working on his book, 
suggested they might have a 
new opportunity to re\'erse 
their convictions.

Banks' sale of loans 
puts students on spot 

By MIKE BEEDLE 
Si aff Wrilcr 

I got some correspondence 
the other day from Student 
Financial Services Associat ion 
of Torrance. California. (an 
outfit I'd never heard 00 
advising that my Guaranteed 
Student Loan was pa t due 
and it was time for me to pay 
up. I had opened the letter on 
the way to Anthro; I'm 
graduating this summer. 

The notice reminded me of a 
friend who'd gotten a similar 
item la t year. when he was a 
junior. She had laughed . and 
wagged her head in disbelief 
before she trashed it. 
"Payment of Guaranteed 
Student Loans wasn't due ," 
she had said . "until nine 
months after graduation . 
Certainly not while you 're still 
in school." That ",a the way I 
understood the program too. so 
I crumpled the not ice and 
banked it off the wall into the 
nearest can. 

But it wouldn 't leave me 
alone. I was nearl v to class 
when I turned to dash back 
and fi sh that wadded·up letter 
out of the garbage and read it 
again. Something was terribl y 
wrong. Why were we student !> 
being hassled for payment that 
we didn't even owe? Thi 
needed to be re olved. not 
ignored. 

That turned out to be a lot

Moreover . th e resolut ion 
revealed tha t hundreds of 
tud e nt s are currentl y

Student Loans has reached 
epidemic proportions. Curio 
ous ly. most of the problem is 
bei ng crea ted by t he lenders -
the banks - not by the 
tudents attempting to dodge 

payments. as conventiona l 
wisdom would have you 
believe. 

I got on t he horn to 
Academic Financial Services 
Association (AFSA) and 
encountered the cia ic boiler

After se ver a l ca ll s to

Ms. Peavy. who ad\'i sed that a 
Mr . We is - fo rm e rl y 
handling my case becau. e my 
accout \vas delinq uent - was 
reassigned . lIe was a collec tion 
agent. She was not. What she 
was has yet to be determined. 

When [explained that I had 
been a full ·time student at 
UCSD since January of 1980, 
and would continue in that 
s tatus until June of 1983. she 
s ignaled that facts would only 
confuse the issue. "The AFSA 
computer shows you termi·

declared. " [ guess you didn 't

"A nd we try to havea ten week

can service more people." Most 
of the coun.eling done is 
"Crisis counseling." When the 
pressure is on. during finals 
and midterms. for example, 
requests for appointment s are 
highest. 

Fev. s t udents go in for

hard one to shake. An M.D. is 
s upposed to ma ke quick

unsure of herself. She has to 
break the stereotype that she 
shouldn 't have to ask for 
help." the doctor says. Even 
so. " Women in Medicine" is 
one of the most popu lar groups 
on campus. 

Hurja has th ree groups

only two male students ha\'e 
expressed any interest in

"Setpoint. " "Bod y Connec·

Eating Disord er s " (REO ). 
Each of the groups is intended 
for anorexic or bulimic 
s t udents. but each has a 
different focu s. In "Body 
Connections." Harju . who 
earned her Ph .D. at the 
Ca lifornia School for 
Professional Psychology . 
works with Dianna Dann of 
the P.E. Department. The 
group will involve discussion 
and exercise. "Setpoint" will 
be like "Body Connections" in 
that the connection exerci se 
has to permanent weight loss 
will be stressed. but there will 
be no exercising. In RED, 
participants will di scuss the 
problems of addicti \'e food 
behavior. 

Harju believes the ad \·an· 
tage of working in groups 1lI be 
the feedback from the other 
s tudent s . in s ig ht i nto 
probl ems. a nd coun seling 
skills that the part icipant will 
pick up. 

Other groups t ha t have 
openings are the " Re·entry

designed for undcrgradua tes 
24 or older. the "Social Skills

Vol. 2, No.5 February 3, 1983 

By TIM KASSOUNI 
Though progressive rock reached its creative peak almost a decade ago 

with King Crimson's energetic finale RED, its influence among contemporary 
musicians is virtually immeasurable. UCSD is no exception. 

Last year, Muir undergraduates Tim Root, Mark Sell, Richard Michos, Dave 
Levy, and Warren Wellen formed a temporary group called Hemlock with the 
hopes ofregenerating the vitality and technical ingenuity of the progressive 
movement. The period was relatively experimental, however. with each 
member drawing from a wide range of musical sources. This year, with 
graduate percussionist John flood taking the place of Levy, the group has 
made a commitment to establish themselves as a cohesive, rhythmic unit. 

Recently, 1 talked at length with keyboardist Root about the musical 
philosophy and approach of the band. 

"This new band BOB. is very much concerned with playing as a unit, and if 
there is any concept behind the name. that is it. BOB represents the idea that 
when the four of us perform, we have one goal- as if we were one individual. 
We are trying very hard to keep individual egos. especially my desire to be the 
focus. from interfering with BOB's creativity. Yet, we would never sacrifice an 
individual style because it is the combination of each individual approach 
that will create BOB's sound." 

The sound of BOB is the result of a wide range of influences, most notably 
the progressive bands of the early 1970's. Yet, the goal of the band is not to 
copy these groups, but rather to expand upon their work, thereby developing 
and applying new musical concepts through composition. 

" I don't think we would even want to be labeled a progressive band in the 
sense that the word implies a style of music that has become outdated. We are 
essentially making new music."

Taking a look at HoUywood with 
'Pyscho' _ author Robert Bloch 

8y CLYDf:Nf: Nf:[ 
Robert Bloch is probably 

best known as the author of 
Psycho, which was later 
adapted to the screen by Alfred 
ffitchcock and became a cult 
classic with filmgoers across 
the nation. Recently, Robert 
Bloch told Hiatus about life. 
liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness in Hollywood. 
lliatus: When did you first 
know that you wanted to 
become a writer? 

writing almost immediately 
after coming to Hollywood. 
matus: How would you 
compare that experience to 
what you would go through as a 
young writer today? 

making a film . 
lIiatus: How would you 
compare the studio system with 
what it was 20 or 30 years ago? 
Bloch: The studio system today 
is governed by so many 
conglomerates. films are 
chosen by people who do not 
direct. write. act: don't know 
how to operate a camera, or 
construct a set. The have no 
creative talent whatsoever. Yet 
they make all the decisions. 
Unfortunately the decisions are 
made on th e basis of 
bookk eeping and c ost 
accountancy. They regard film 
in terms of product and promo: 
people will sit there and 
evaluate films in terms of

·PSYCNO' 
IS ~ITCHCOCK'S GREAtEST CHIUER! 

Alfred Hitchcock's dassic horror film " Psycho" owed much of Ibe 
credit to Ibe insoired writing of Ibe veteran aulbor Robert Bloch. 

810ch: I think I must have been 
about 15 when I entered into 
correspondence with American 
fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft : 
and he suggested to me that I 
try my hand at writing. I 
immediately jumped at the idea 
and started to write short 
stories. When I was 17 and 
graduated from high school I 
sold my first story. from then 
on I had no idea of doing 
anything else. 

Bloch: Those opportuinties 
don't exist today. There are no 
syndication outfits today. It is 
almost impossible for a young 
writer to be given any freedom 
in his. or her own assignments. 
The producers have input into 
the scripts, the story editors 
have to take what film is shot 
and put it together in a manner 
that conveys the story. Directors 
al 0 have their input into the 
filmmaking process. The only 
way a young person can break 
into the field is to direct their 
own projects. and try to get 
people to see what they can do 
as writers. There are many stone 
walls in the way of a young 
person today. It has never been 
more difficult than it is now to 
become a writer or director in 
the business. 

Another look at the new 91X 
lliatus: What interested you in 
the Horror game? 
Bloch: I was first exposed to it 
through seeing silent movies. 
Seeing Lon Chaney in films like 
the Hunchback of Notre Dame 
made a tremendous impression 
on me. When I was nine I began 
to wonder what elements of that 
particular picture frightened 
me. I began to read more about 
this thing and tried to 
understand my own fears. All 
the childhood fears; fears of 
death, darkness. I guess I went 
into it a little further than most 
youngsters. 
lIiatus: How did you start 
writing for television and films? 
8loch: I was invited to come 
west and do a television script 
for an independent production 
company called ZIV. They don 't 
have them anymore, but at that 
time in the 1950s there were a 
number of freelance television 
production companies that 
syndicated programs for 
tel evision. I came out here and 
wrote the script. by the time I 
had done two or three scripts for 
them I was asked to write for the 
television program Alfred 
Hitchcock Presents. I was 

lIiatu.s: How would you 
compare writing a novel as 
opposed to writing a 
screenplay? 
Bloch: There is one great 
difference. When you are writing 
a novel in most instances you 
don 't have a committee 
breathing down your neck and 
looking over your shoulder 
when you type. You have much 
greater freedom with novels. It 
is true that there are many 
novels written to order today. In 
various genres, for example 
Harlequin Romances, they are 
done on an assembly line basis 
just as if they were being put out 
by a typewriter that had no 
human hands operating it. 
Definite formula stori es. 
settings and characters in a 
particular set pattern and 
fashion. But for the most of us 
the greater latitude of writing 
exists in the area of the novel. 
In films there are certain 
constraints put on the writers by 
producers , budgets . and 
tailoring material for certain 
actresses and actors. There are a 
lot of egos to consider when 

DELICIOSO! 
SONORA STYLE 

MEXICAN 
DINNERS 

By I'lIKEL 1001'188 
Critic on the Loose 

At long last, San Diego hasan 
exciting radio station. Not 
necesarily a good one, mind 
you, but at least an exciting one. 

The station is of course 9lX 
(XTRA-fM), (see interview) local 
home of The Rock of the '80s 
(Copyright 1983, Rick CarrOll ), a 
term that translates roughly 
from hypese as "Dare To Be 
Dumb." 

Dare To Be Dumb (DTBD) 
music is a mixture of American 
and British sounds. some of it 
with intellectual pretensions 
but all with attitudes that 12-
year-olds can relate to. 

DTBD's US representa tives 
include catchy. but useless 
" new wave" artists like Oingo 
Boingo, Berlin and honorary 
American Adam Ant. as wel l as 
pseudo-important groups like 
Wall of Voodoo and Devo (once 
an inventive band, but now 
merely smug ). 

British DTBD mu s i c 
encompasses the overstyli zed 
New Pop groups. such as the 
Thompson Twins and Duran 
Duran. plus overserious neo-
psychedelia bands like, well. the 
Psychedelic Furs.' (The major

role model for many of these 
artists is, not surprisingly, David 
Bowie, that master of artificial 
rock/pop/soul whose recent 
"Putting Out fire" showed just 
how enjoyably overblown this 
type of music can be.) 

Now some of these DTM 
artists have been played on 
other local radio stations, but 
the genius of 91X is that it 
makes DTBD the basis for its 
rather tight forma t It·s the 
cumulative effec t of this 
repetiti ve dumbness that does 
the trick : 91X forcdeeds you 
musical j unk food (the aural 
equivalent of l iving at Jack-in-
the Box ) and makes you like it. 
creating what intell ignet-pop 
songstress Bonnie Hayes calls 
wi th c lever spell ing, "Dum Fun: 
Something to make you happy 
against your will ." 

The sou nd of 91X has a 
decidedly modern feel to it. but 
the station 's format is strongly 
reminiscent of Boss Radio, a 
sim i larly constricted-playl ist 
syndica te that reigned supreme 
over San Diego airwaves on 
KGB-AM (now KCNN) in the 
latter half of the Sixt ies. A 
glance at some of the titles on 
IfGB 21 Boss Goldens Vol. 1 (a 
thrift store staple. incidentally) 

reveals such classically dumb 
song s as Count fi ve's 
" Psychotic Rea ct ion," t he 
Seeds' "Push in ' Too Hard" and 
Music Machine's "Talk Talk." Al l 
that's different on 1983 91X is 
that the synthesizer has 
replaced the guitar as the 
primary instrument. and the 
1910 fruitgum Company has 
been reincarnated as Adam Ant. 

There is a lot of good music to 
be found on 91X, just as there 
was on Boss Radio (Sta Mo-
town soul, British Invasion pop 1. 
if you're patient enough. The 
91X playlist includes such gems 
as the Beat's marvelous "Save it 
for later, . Culture Club 'ssoulful 
'00 You Really Want to Hurt 
Me" (featuring the very firc 
singing of Boy-Girl Georgel and 
ABC's "The look of Lov\.': a 
mock Motown number that is no 
less mannered that most of UK 
DTBD pop but succeeds by 
capturing some of the elegant 
dumbness of eternal fashion 
plate Bryan ferry. 

And 9lX helps its own cause 
by being open to a wide variety 
of new music, as long a it' 
trendy or hip - or at lea<;t 
"modem' -sounding. After ai L 
t hi is The Rock of the '80s, like 
it or not.

Sy JOHrt rtt:[ 
for the average music public, 

the realm of jazz remains a 
virtually unexplored arena. 
Although one of San Diego's 
major stations has made the 
"bold" jump to alternative 
radio, it still neglects such 
musical genres as ethnic, funk, 
and jazz. For most San Diegans, 
this radio medium is their sole 
guiding hand as what to listen 
to. Few can find KSDS, San 
Diego's all jazz radio, leaving 
them in the position of moving 
blindly within a restricted 
musical repertoire. 

The contributions that jazz 
music and musicians have made 
to pop music are too great to 
allow it to be passed over for the 
likes of Men at Work and Led 
Zeppelin. When a guitarist of 
such prominence as Lee 

Ri~nour is brought into San 
Diego, the chance to explore 
and dissect modern jazz is also 
too great to pass up. 

As well as a very impressive 
stuoio career, Ritenour has 

recorded fifteen albums of his 
own and toured with jazz greats 
Dave Grusin & Sergio Mendes. 
Ritenour also enjoys a massive 
amount of popularity in Japan 
where six of his albums were 
originally released. Ritenour's 
group, friendship was his first 
major move to a solo career. 

While still being considered a 
pop artist. Ritenour does not 
have the sappy gimmckry of 
othe jazz players such as Chuck 
Mangione and George Benson. 

His music is a very healthy 
blend between technical 
expertise and strong melodic 
foundations. Overall a very 
worthwhile way to spend an 
evening. Ritenour will play this 
Saturday in Mandeville 
auditorium. Tickets are 
available at the box office. 

One artist that UCSD students 
should be familiar with is Greg 
Kihn. Kihn played to a sold-out 
UCSD gym last year and was 
greeted to an enormous turnout 
for the last TG of 1981. He will

Jau artist Lee Ritenour will perform In Mandeville Saturday night 

again perform in La Jolla, this 
time at the Rodeo for two shows 
Sunday night. 

Kihn and his band are touring 
on the heels of their latest hit 
"Jeopardy" which is climbing 

the charts. The Bay-area rockers 
gain notoriety and big bucks 
with Rockihnroll which gave us 
"The Breakup Song", one of the 
most requested singles of 1981. 

Eight years ago Kihn was 

playing his acoustic guitar and 
singing his songs at UC Berkeley 
and then in 1979 BAM, a 
northern California music 
magazine named the Greg Kihn 
Band "Best Uve Act". Since that 
time Kihn and the boys have 
taken off. 

for those who have not seen 
Kihn it is definitely worthwhile. 
The first performance on Sunday 
will be a 17-year old and up 
audience while the second show 
is over-21 only. 

The Bus Boys are the great 
black hope. The inabliity of the 
l.A. band to gain airplay on any 
of the mainstream stations in 
the country has caused them to 
move from the possible hopes of 
integrating music in America to 
a band that is drifting into 
obscurity. 

Both of their albums are very 
polished entities displaying 
excellent rock and roll but it 
was not possible for them to 
judge on the music alone. 
Program directors all 
throughout the county just did 
not see room in their Black 
Sabbath - ACDC menues for 
real music. While the Bus Boys 
purvey a traditional style they 
are still new. Their music is fresh 
as well as having a statement. 
They will be appearing at the 
Belly-Up Tavern on Wednesday.

expression. BOB's problem With 
Though BOB has now been 

together for almost four 
months, the members feel that 
they are still some distance 
from playing as a true unit. 
Becuase of this feeling, they are, 
as a method of obtaining their 
goal. developing distinctly 
profound attitudes towards 
their music and its effect on an 
audience. 

" Ideally, BOB's main goal is 
to generate an emotional as well 
as an intellectual response from 
its audience. Playing as a unit 
better enables us to have this 
dra matic effect. BOB is 
definitely not playing the music 
si mply for the benfit of its 
members. 

"BOB's audience needs to 
approach the music in an 
entirely different frame of mind 
because for a listener to really 
experience the music, he has to 
be able to inject his own 
imagination into what we 
present to him. We want our 
music to be a vehicle for 
intellectual growth. 

this format is that we are neither 
skilled enough as a band, nor 
aware enough of each other's 
individual styles to make the 
piece cohesive and presentable 
to an aUdience." 

One song in BOB's repertoire 
that bridges the structural-
improvisational gap is 
"Sheltering Sky" by the current 

originals, involves a series of 
expanding rhythm s and 
int ertwining harmoni c 
sequences. The song is 
undoubtedly one of the most 
technically challenging pieces 
in the repertoire because it 
consists of a variety of sections 
and corresponding mood 
changes, as well as the demand 
for excellence from each player. 

In approaching a new piece of 
music, the band is challenged at 
various levels. Initially, the 
group must write a cohesive 
tune - it has to flow in a 

-_ .. 

peformed. 
In order for an audience to 

remain actively involved in the 
music. BOB stre'iSS innovatIOn, 

Innovation i., nelCssary 
because of the mind ·s unique 
ability to predict the future. 
What we are attempting to do is 
set up a predicatable event by 
using the knowledge we have of 
conventional structures, and 
then changing the event as a 
means of creating tension. The 
audience, in listening to this. 
will hear not only our 
innovation, but their original 

music. which is simply a torm of 
communication. We want 
people to be attected by the 
experience and find that musk 
truly speaks in a broad way 
about discovering wnscious 
ness. In that light it becomes 
important to see that the 
message cannot be found in the 
technicality of the music itself, 
but rather in the moods and the 
depths of the intertwining 
musical aspects of BOB. 

MUSic has the power to tap 
different emotions that don't 
normally surface because it 
triggers a part of the mind that 
we consistently subdue to 
facilitate logical thought. It can 
cau':>e you to con5ider your 
values and chanqf' your \~ay of 
thinking if it h prnented 
correctly. 

. One of BOB ~ main gOd l., is 
lor ib audience to (oll!>lstently 
reevaluate their idea~ towdrd~ 
music becuase ot thl' emotion!) 
they feel as a rt'5ult of our 
sound . We want people to 
always conSider e\ery 
possibility and choose a 
direction after open-minded 
thought By taking this stance, 
BOB is challenged with 
presenting alternatives to 
existing thought trains and 

"' 5tereotypes.

~ their obligation to feel a

In many ways, we present our 
audience with a series of 
questions that they need to 
explore in order to experience 
emotion. The audience's input 
through these questions is 
crucial to the validity of the 
music because we want it to 
affect everyone. It must have the 
ability to conjure numerous 
images in the mind of an 
audience, dependent on any

As for the future, BOB is 
experimenting with several 
musical styles - improvisat-
ions as well as more 
conventional. structured music. 
" We find it much more difficult 
to be innovative when working 
within more standardized 
musical structures, but we're 
not yet able, conceptually, to 
deal with a completely 
improvisational format.

involve an interaction between 
the members of the band.

work. Only in films do they get 
awaywith this nonsense that the 
director is the creator of the 
work. This is not to minimize 
the importance of the director. 
malus: What do you think the 
role of special effects should be 
in a film? 
Bloch: The special effects of 
today are impressive. They have 
added a lot to fantasy and 
science fiction films. However, 

consider the great classic films 
of Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi. and 
Boris Karloff, they were made on 
small budgets with minimal 
special effects. The actors in 
these films made them 
frightening by their acting 
ability. Consider this, LT., who 
was created by special effects is 
a bigger star than the other 
actors who were in the film; 
doesn't it seem strange th,~t this 

character isn't human or being 
played by a human? 
malus: What changes would 
you like to see in the 
filmmaking industry in the 
future? 
Bloch: I think that I would like 
a return of filmmakers into 
positions of decision making in 
the business, fewer accountants 
and business~riented people 
controlling thr. art. 

niatus: what do you see that is 
wrong in Hollywood today, or 
the screenwriters' guild in 
making films?

into a stud io and takes someone 
else's novel or short story t() 
make a film out or hires a write 
to adapt it into a screen pia) 
Then two or more writers go 
over this to write up the dialog. 
After all of this, if the director 
calls it his film then he is a 
fraud.

Bloch: I think that something 
has to be done to the theory that 
the director is the creator ofthe 
film. In my own background I 
have known people like Alfred 
Hitchcock, who placed their 
own individual touch on a film, 
but were not responsible for 
writing the story. They worked 
from someone else's novel, and 
yet they are regarded as part 
author.

author because he and his

Everyday productions on 
television and films all use the 
same process of production. 
They all have the same cameras, 
lights and crews, however it is 
the author who puts in the 
creativity in a piece of work. In 
the theater the writers-authors 
are the creators of the work. The

Douglas Adams is a tall bi-

insignificant planet on the outer 
rim of the Galaxy called Earth, 
which is, by the way, in the path 
of the Great Intergalactic 
Hyperspace By-pass. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy started as a BBC 
radio series a few years back. 
The popularity of this far-out 
series spread throughout 
England. The novelization ofthe 
raido show by Adams brought 
" Babel fish" and "Don't Panic " 
into the vocabulary of readers 
on this side of the Atlantic. The

Animation festival nee again 
turns ou_t a great show 

By ClYDt:Nt: rtf:( 
Once again, Mike and Spike, 

like the swallows to Capistrano, 
have returned to the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art to 
delight us with the world of 
Animation. This year. the 
program offers a look at the 
broad spectrum of animation 
styles, which cover the early 
days of Max Fleischer's 
character Betty Boop in the 
1930s to that of the modem day 
wizard Will Vinton and his 
Claymation productions. 

Two films in the festival this 
year are truly spectacular 
representations of this art form. 
lIokusai, by English animator 
Tony White, takes an astounding 
look at the works of famed 
Japanese artist Hokusai. It is 
wonderous to watch these 
pieces of art that have adorned 
cards and posters come alive 
before your eyes. 

Another type of art in the 
world of animation is 
represented by Ballet 
Robotique. Thl!. film was done 
hy Bill Rogers, who has taken 
music by .. orne 01 the great 

mastcr~ and .syn<hronilcd it to 
the construction of a car by 
robots; Swan i..1kewillnever be 
the !>arne. 

Along with the return of 
Seaside Woman are other great 
works on the field of animation 
art. However, there are no pieces 
of work that should have been 
left out of the proQram. 

Passages and Saliemania, 
though they represent different 
directions in the Field of 
animation, the length of these 
pieces left most of the audience 
groaning, Saliemania from 
Yugoslavia is 13 minutes too 
long, and considering that it is 
only 13 minutes long should tell 
you something 

Rowena Pahee, the filmmaker 
of Passaqes, uses many images 

of religion ar.d de.ath in her 
piece, and is trying to manipu-
late her audience, but doesn 't 
reveal to what end, 

The Animation festival 
continues this weekend. Tickets 
are available at the UCSD Box 
Office at the advance sale price 
of $4.50, and at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art , 
the night of the performance for 
$5. 

lawrence of Arabia here 
Truly great motion picture 

epics are a rare occurence in 
Hollywood. A good example of 
this nearly extinct species is the 
phenomenol Lawrence of 
Arabia This film was made in 
the early 1960's and was the 
product of the combined talents 
of Pete O'Toole, Omar Shariff, 
Alec Guinness, and Anthony 
Quale. The story concerns the 
exploits of T.t:. Lawrence in 

Arabia, the noted soldier and 
adventurer, who adopted the 
dress and many of the customs 
of the land. 

David Lean directed this film 
and created a truly spectacular 
work of art and beauty with the 
cinematography of this film.

More swimmers qualify 
By JOY REARDON 

AI! hough battle-wea ry and 
exhausted the Triton 
intercollegiate sw immers 
docked up with flying colors, 
earning themselve a total of 
twelve more national 
qualifying times in last 
weekend's skirmishes against 
Cal State Northridge and the 
Santa Barbara Swim Club. 
Northridge beat the UCSD 
men 91-24 and the women 65-
47, but provided competition 
s t iff enough to drive three 
swimmers through time 
barriers to qualify for the 
upcoming NCAA Division fII 
Championships in Canton, 
Ohio. Tracy Strahl qualified in 
the men's 200 backstroke with 
a time of 2:00.68, Kathy 
Beckett did so in the women's 
50 breaststroke (34.10), and 
Barbara Lee topped the even-
ing with national qualifying 
performances in both the 100 
and 200 free events (55.66 and 
2:00.48). The men's 400 
medley relay leam edged ever 
nearer towards their nemesis . 
approaching the 3:39 
qualifying time with a 3:41.88. 

Sat urday night's opponent, 
the Santa Barbara Swim Club, 
again provided the strong 
matchups needed to qualify 
more Tritons for the national 
cham ion s hip meet. The 
women's 400 medle, relav 
team (Charles, B-eckett, 
Morro\\, Brafman) and the800 
free relar team (Brafman, 
G ilmore, ~lons, Lee) achieved 
ne\\ school records as well as 
national qualifymg times. 
Allison Gilmore added the 200 
fly onto her "To Swim" list for 

national s wit h a time of 
2: 19.37, and Kim Compton 
took a big chunk off of her best 
time in this event, nearing to 
within two seconds of 
qualifying. "Kim \vill really 
help give us depth at the 
Nationals," Coach Bill Morgan 
commented happil y. Diana 
Charles won the 200 
backst roke (2:2 1.88) to qualify 
for her second event (after 
making it in the 1000 free last 
month) while Kathy Beckett 
also earned herself a second

event at Canton with a 2:40.70 
in the 200 breaststroke. 
Barbara Lee rounded out her 
weekend by swimming to a 
total of four qualifying times 
as she captured the 50 and 500 
freestyle time standards (2:l.58 
and 5:20.15). The Tnton 
women lost to Santa Barbara 
38-57 hut the men were 
victorious, 54-38. 

For Coach Morgan , the 
weekend proved to be an 
unexpected su rprise. "People 
worked pretty hard las t week, 
so I'm surprised that we did so 
well," he smiled. "A lot of

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Stall Writer .. 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Where hGl'c you Kone, 
Crace Bearis~ Our lIati01l turns its 1011 ely eyes to yolt. 

- Simon and Garfunkul 
At the outset of the 1983 campaign, Grace Bearis was penci lied 

in a . the directorof the offense for the UCSD women's basketball 
team. Twenty-one games into the season , Bearis has not only 
been relegated to bench duty, she rarely sees playing time. A" a 
result, she appears to have 10 t all confidence in her ability to 
handle the ball. Her replacement, Brenda Sweatt, is more of an 
off-guard than one who shoud be the tempo setter and leader in 
assists . This is the dark spot in an otherwi e bright season. 
Jennifer Gregory has been most impressive with her consistent 
all·around play and Paulette Parker ha begun to share a large 
chunk of the offense as she should. Julie Krause is conI ributing 
well with her smooth jumper and the two freshmen centers Teik 

. Francis and Shelley McKeone, have clogged up the middle and 
dominated play inside. A seven-game winning streak and an 
overall record of 14-7 gives Coach Judy Malone her first 
legitimate shot at the playoffs. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. If vou thought smuggling 
hashish out of Turkey is a difficult task , try sneaking into a 
basketball game in Triton Pavilion. The athletic department IS 
charging admission for the firs t time in the school's history 
(f inally), and the wardens at the door do everything but frisk you 
on the way in . Whether this is good or bad , the hroadcasters at 
cam pus radio station KSDT spent twenty minutes trying to get 
enough pa , es for their engineers so they could air the game. 
Even the PA announcer had to spend five minutes in conference 
before he could get past the door and announce the game. The 
refs were 15 minutes late for the game, but we think we know 
why. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Men's assistant basketball coach 
Tom Marshall took a big gamble Tuesday night by wearing hi . 
grey ports jacket for the game against Cal Lutheran . Marshall's 
team had gone 0-2 when he wore grey, but fortunately the club 
came through for him this time by winning 79-()5. A loss may 
have limited Marshall to only brown for the rest of the year. He's 
o for 6 with blue, so that jacket's in the closet to stay. Marshall's 
on a solid brown win streak of even, which brings up the 
question of what he will wear for the crucial Westmont contest 
at the end of the year. ''['II wear brown for sure," says Mars hall. 
"I'll wear brown pants, a brown shirt and tie. a brown coat. and 
brown socks. I'll probably even have brown underwear on for 
that one." 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Every college basketball team 
st rives for the ultimate achievement : to be ranked number one in 
the nation. But this season the #1 ranking has been more of a 
burden than an advantage. Once they have attained the topspot , 
North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana , Memphis State,

Does winning only one out of 
four dual meets upset Morgan' 
Not at all. "It would be great to 
go out and win all of the dual 
meets. but then \\ e'd get to 

Nationals and get blo\\ n 
away," he explained. 
" wimming against a better 
team is the only wa) \\e·ll get 
any beuer." Another reason 
that Morgan does not bemoan 
a les than .500 dual meet 
season lies in the fact that each 
sWimmer can compete 111 up to 
fiv e indi\'idual e\'ents at

12 The UCSD Guardian 

Skiers hit the Goldmine slopes 
continued from page 9 
hope of reaching the fini sh 
line first. Both the men 's and 
women's teams compete on 
the arne course but are scored 
separately with the top four 
finishers for each team 
earning points. 

Coached by Nicholis Nedd 
and Art Sloan, the UCSD 
men's team is in first place 
after two race weekends. 
Their next race, on Fehruary 
12 at Goldmine, is critical as 
the SCISA league repre cnta· 
tive to the national champion· 
ships is determined based 
upon performances over the 
first four race weekends. Nedd 
cites depth as the key the 
UC D's success thus far. 
While teams such as UCSB 
rely on the spectacular 
pef ormances of one or two 
s kiers, the I rc D team 
benefits from the consistent 
performances by seve ral 
quality skiers in both events. 
The top performers for UCSD 
thus far have been Doug Hake, 
~like Hann , and Chri s 
Littlewood. Oddly enough, 
LTC D's top performers are 
generally skier~ who had little 
racing experience prior to 
joimng the team. 

UCSD is a unique ski team. 
The less-than-ideal skiing 
location here in La Jolla has 
forced the team to create 
al ternate traInIng methods_ 
Practice consist I)f field 

"1 5 

workouts on Tue day and 
T hur sday, with we ig ht 
training on Monday, Wedne.· 
day, and Friday. Nedd feels 
that trength is the key to 
performance, and that in some 
cases it even supercedes 
technique in imlxlrtance. The 
team also benefits from a 
unique grass skiing program 
which develops technique by 
simulating racing conditions. 
Grass skiing, a sport in itself, 
has expanded the depth of a 
team which enjoys little time 
on the snow. It is taken so 
seriously that Nedd and Mike 
Hann have qualified for the 
Grass kiing World Cham· 
pionships to be held in 
Aust ralia this May. However. 
the uniqueness of the UeSD 
team goes beyond just 
train ing; lJCSD has earned the 
nickname of the "HI -Tech 
Team" due to the de\'elopment 
of a two-way radio .,ystem by 
Assistant Coach Art Sloan. 
This re\'o lution arv de\ice, 
which includes a head~et and 
antenna, allo\\s the coaches to 
communicate with the LJCSf) 
racers as to the conditions of 
the course and other vital 
information prior to each run . 
This is often a deciding factor 
because, unlike the coaches, 
the racer are not allowed 
practice runs 

Whether or not UCSD will 
go to the national champion-

hip~ shall be determined on 
the weekend of February 12 

and the following race 
weekend . Regard less, Coach 
Nedd is proud of the team 
which he credit s as the best 
group ever. And why not -
what else would you expect 
from a coast a I Sou t hern 
California schoo!?

Al McGuire: refs 
in college hoop 
continued froll1 page 10 
conference and the other is 
from the other team'" 
conference. This , in my 
opinion, wrong for two 
reasons: it's di fficult for the 
offiCials and it's not morally 
right for the game. The 
officials have never worked 
together before, so you're 
goi ng to get inconsistencies. 
And the visiting coach feel~ 
that one guy is there to protect 
him, theotherguytohurt him, 
that sort of thing. 

In my opinIOll, In an 
intersec tional game t he refs 

s hou ld come from the 
conference or area of the 
visiting team . All con tract s are 
two-year contracts, so t he next 
year' it's done in reverse. 

For the NCAA tournament, 
each con ference assigns 
official crews. During those 
early games. the NCAA has 
people observing I he crews, 
grading them , and allowing 
the best ones to keep going 
along as the tournament 
progresse s. So there'., 
pressure on them , too. If the 
crews produce, they go on. It'" 
that simple. 

Running Thoughts 
continued from page J 1 
and L'CLA have all folded in quick fashion. Maybe the pressure 
at the top is too much to bear, or possibly there just isn 't a 
dominant team in college basketball anymore. 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT. After Cal Baptist 
sharpshooter Joey Stein passed up two wide open shot 
opportunities in a recent game against the Tritons in the 
Pavilion, Lancer coach Jerry King told his player, "If you don't 
pull the trigger next time. I'm going to pull your harts down in 
front of all these people." 
COULD IT BE DEPT. There will never be a more important 
weekend of volleyball for the UCSD Tritons than the upcoming 
one when they face #4 Pepperdine and #1 UCLA at home Friday 
and Saturday. According to our Was hington bureau 
correspondent "Rodney," Sports Illustrated will have a reporter 
on hand. Apparently S1. plans to devote next week's front cover 
to Doug Dannevi k's men 's team should UCSD upset both Div. 1 
powerhouses.

The Right to Choose 
by Sharon Moxon 

"I don't carl' if shl"s a lesbian, 
she ha the ri~ht to do whatever 
she wants." 

"No, It doe n't bothl'r me. It 's 
hiS choiC\~." 

"Pl'opll' have thl' right to 
choosl' to he ga y if they want to." 

I hl'ar thl'sl' phrases often. 
Many pl'apk' think that thl'y are 
heln~ ~o hheral and accepting 
when they say the l' thing -
thl'y ' re not. We do not have the 
chOice of being homosexual or 
heterosexual; our l'xual 
orlt'ntatlon IS a given. However, 
we do have the lholce of betng 
happy 

As gay p:ople, we can choose 
to lead a double lIft', or what we 
call ht'lng "In the closet," 
keeping our true feeltngs from 

___ " our friends and relatives, 

Support Group 
The Leshi;m and Gay support 

group was founded In the pring 
of '82. Now, In It's third quarter, 
it\ hettl'r than ever. The support 
group I JU t a group of people 
that meet once a week to talk 
ahout almost anythmg. It IS all 
kept strictly lonfldential and 
prOVides a casual, frll'ndly 
atmosphere for informal, opl'n 
discussions. The peopk Within 
the gtoup offer support and 
fr iendshi p to each other and 
anyone else who is open to it. I 

always leaH' the group With a 
good feeling - for my ·df and (or 
these around me. 

Meetings art Wednesdays.l[ 7 
pm tn SB 4060B, and everyone 
IS welcome - for the whole 
quartt'r, or Just fix (lnl' night. 
The group IS for pellple whll arl

Parents and Friends 
Of Lesbians & Gays 

mall1tainlng a p ublic appearance 
by continua ll y denying and 
rejecttng all we belteve in. Along 
with thiS lifestyle, though, comes 
guIlt, unfulfillme nt and 
loneliness. Our o ther al ternative 
IS "conung out," sharing who we 
a re with those we live , a llowing 
ourst'lve to expe rience 
completeness and happiness. 
Coming o ut to others is a 
complIcated and risky process, 
but when a gay person chooses to 
do this, she/he also learns to 
accept her/ himself as a valid 
human being. 

Parents and Friends of lesbIans and Gays (PFLAG) have come 
to San Diego! Recently, a chapter of this nationWide orgal1lzation 
formed In San Diego. It is an organization compo ed of people who 
have gay children, or are friends and other relatives of gays. Gay 
people themselve are also active members. 

The organization fu nctions as a support group for parents who 
are having difficulties dealing With the fact that they have a lesbian 
or gay chtld. Meeting other parents of gay offspn ng who "have 
been there" or still are, has been a great help to PFLAG members . 
Families that might otherwise have broken apart are brought 
together to JISCUSS the issue of homosexuality in an open and 
honest atmosphere . PFLAG can also offer gay children valuable 
gUidance about telling parents that they are gay. 

PFLAG is committed to help change attitudes and crea te an 
environment of understanding, so that gay children can live with 
digni ty and respect. PFLAG invites you to share their knowledge, 
to be free from fear, and to reach out , search and discover more 
about being human. One mother and PFLAG member puts it, "As 
truth replaces fear and superstition, attitudes are changing. In the 
meantime, don't let society rob you of your special child." 

Meetmgs of the local chapter are the third Sunday of evety 
month at 2:30 pm. The next meeting is February 20th in the 
"Community Room," which IS on the left side of the Home 
Savmgs at UniverSIty Towne Centre. The San Diego chapter 
leaders are Hy and Lillian Rubin . They can be contacted a t 439-
4421, or wnte PFLAG, P.O. Box 1695, OceanSide, CA, 92054.

When I first discovered my 
homosexualtty, I was very 
unhappy. I kept it to myself 
because I knew that I would be 
condemned. Then, afte r a lot of 
confusion a nd uffering, I 
learned to accept myself and my 
lesbianism. I chose to live a gay 
lifestyle . Tho I.' who allowed 
themselves to see my happiness 
also accepted my decision. 

Finally I got up the ne rve to go 
to my fi rst LAGO meeting, and I 
was amazed at what I found -
people who were open , giving 
and caring. I had found "my 
people," people who soon 
became a fami ly to me. With 
them I was able to be all free and 
whole - all myself. 

I no longer deny myself. I am 
gay, and I am ve ry happy. By 
telling people that I am gay, I am 
able to share With them the love 
and happlm~ss that I have found . 

I do have the right to hoose. 
Not to he a homosexual, but to 
be myself - to love and be loved .
