“ Here’s your money back/ Here’s your punk rock back!"

By Angela Chen
News Editor

Student media heads are threatening legal 
action against A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s for his 
Friday-afternoon decision to freeze all funding to 
student publications.

Gupta announced Friday morning that he 
wished to pull funding from controversial humor 
newspaper the Koala, whose editor in chief made 
a racial slur on Student-Run Television the night 
before in reference to Black Student Union mem-
bers protesting the Feb. 15 “Compton Cookout.”

“We’ve tried, throughout this year, to redo [the 
media guidelines], and essentially not fund [the 
Koala],” he said at an impromptu meeting. I don’t 
know if it’ll get rid of them, but on the part of A.S., 
we can defund them — we absolutely can defund 
them, and I believe we must defund them.”

Gupta said he had the executive power to 
freeze media-org funding because the current 
allocation of money for media organizations vio-
lates Section II of the A.S. Constitution. The sec-
tion states the role of the council is “to create and 
execute programs which serve the collective inter-
ests of the undergraduate population.” According 
to Gupta, the current system — which has funded 
the Koala since 1982— is hurting students, and 
therefore not serving the collective interest.

Foundation for Individual Rights in Education 
and American Civil Liberties Union have

Two years after the grand opening 
of Price Center East, University 
Centers officials said they are in the 
final stages of filling the remaining 
store spaces with a bank, coffee shop, 
and hair salon, as they promised.

Price Center East opened in May 
2008, funded by the Price Center 
Expansion Referendum — a $39 
quarterly student fee enacted in Spring 

Quarter 2003. Only five vendors have 
been installed in the space since its 
opening, leaving three vacant slots.

“The students wanted the best of 
both worlds,” Assistant Vice  Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary Ratcliff said. 
“They wanted an expansion that was 
going to be large enough to serve the 
student body when we reached steady 
state enrollment, and they wanted the 
fee as low as possible. What that meant 
is there needed to be other sources of 
revenue to pay to operate the building, 
and retail was the answer.”

Price Center East already has a 
number of  food retailers, such as 
Tapioca Express and Burger King. 

Two Years Later, PC East Starts to Fill Empty Lots
Price Center’s vacant retail 
spaces were originally
designated to house a bank,
coffee shop and hair salon.

Hundreds of students walked 
out of an administration-planned 
teach-in yesterday morning to  
attend a counter teach-in organized 
by the Black Student Union. 

The Feb. 24 Price Center protest 
began with a press conference held 

by the BSU, the 
student organiza-
tion that declared 
campus climate to 
be in a “state of 
emergency” last 
Friday. The BSU 
has addressed the 

“toxic” environment with a rally 
and a list of 32 demands. BSU 
Chair David Ritcherson called 
for the UCSD chancellor cabinet 
to respond to the organization’s 
demands by March 4 — the same 
day as a systemwide protest against 
limited accessibility to higher edu-

cation — with a “thorough, written 
timeline for immediate action.” 

Press-conference speakers 
included history professor Daniel 
Widener, who applauded A.S. 

President Utsav Gupta for his recent 
decision to freeze funding for all 33 
student media organizations, then 
asked administrators to disregard 
the current budget crisis in favor of 

meeting all the BSU’s demands.

sions of the budget crisis to affect

denounced Gupta’s actions as uncon-
stitutional, in violation of the First 
Amendment.   

FIRE sent Gupta a seven-page let-
ter requesting that he end the funding 
freeze immediately. 

Gupta said he is working with 
UCSD legal counsel.

“I’m not going to bow down to 
threats of litigation,” he said.

Gregorian said he has contacted 
the ACLU and FIRE, and is work-
ing closely with the Student Press Law 
Center. Although lawyers from these 
organizations have assured him that 
they will represent the Koala in court, 
he said he plans to file a grievance 
with the campus judicial board before 
involving outside action.  

“We’re essentially trying to resolve 
this issue inside of UCSD first,” he said.  

Gregorian emphasized that Gupta’s 
actions were unconstitutional because 
he froze funding due to content.

Gupta has chartered a media review 
board to reevaluate the process of allo-
cating funds to student publications. 
The board consists of seven media-org 
representatives and seven represen-
tatives from the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee — a diversity-ori-
ented group that includes the BSU — 
along with seven other representatives 
from various councils and groups.

“If Utsav contends that this is about 
content, not funding, I implore people 
to ask why SAAC is given the same 
number of media votes as media [orga-
nizations],” he said. “If this isn’t content-
related, why are they even involved?”

Gregorian and Thomas  Dadourian 
— co-manager of the now-defunct 
SRTV — have been denied access to a 
number of BSU events.  

Gregorian said he tried to speak 
at the “Open and Honest Dialogue” 
forum, held in Muir College on 
Tuesday night by BSU Vice Chair 
Fnann Keflezighi, but was prevented 
because she didn’t “trust” him.

“They’re allowed to do that since it 
is a private, not university-sanctioned, 
program” he said. “I just think it wasn’t 
open, or honest.” 

Because of privacy privileges at 
student-run events, Gregorian said he 
thought the BSU, by walking out of 
the university teach-in and holding 
its own, was creating a limited forum 
where opponents could be silenced.  

Dadourian was barred from film-
ing at both the Monday-night BSU 
meeting and the “Open and Honest 
Dialogue” forum.  

“I explained to Fnann that it would 
be from an objective viewpoint,” he 
said. “She asked the crowd to raise their 
hands if anyone was uncomfortable 

SO, YEAH, ANYWAYS By Marina Mizar

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie

discussions of our demands,” Widener 
said. 

After the press conference ended 
at 11:30 a.m., participants marched 
from Library Walk to the official teach-
in, scheduled to be held at the Price 
Center East Ballroom. The crowd — 
which included community members, 
as well as students from Cal State San 
Bernandino, San Diego State and the 
University of Southern California — 
chanted slogans such as “Real Pain, 
Real Action”.

Following speeches by theater 
professor Nadine George and LGBT 
Center director Shaun Travers, A.S. 
Associate Vice President of Diversity 
Affairs Jasmine Phillips and BSU Vice 
Chair Fnann Keflezighi called for the 
attendees to walk out and attend a 
counter teach-in instead.

“If you truly care about our uni-
versity, if you want to stand in soli-
darity, you will join me in walking 
out of this teach-in and joining us at 
our teach-in,” Keflezighi said.

The majority of participants left 
the room and convened at the stairs 
above the Triton statue. 

Speakers at the counter teach-
in included Cross-Cultural Center 
director Edwina Welch. She stressed 
that the protests were not about indi-
vidual acts of racism, but an institu-
tional problem. 

“You’ve felt racism if you’ve gone 
down Library Walk and not been 
handed flyers, if you’ve sat in class and 
nobody’s sat by you,” she said. “What 
gets lost is the day-to-day macro and 
micro aggression on campus.”

Literature professor Daniel Childs 
agreed with Welch, condemning the 
system instead of individuals.

“This is a white-supremacist, rac-
ist, classist, misogynist institution,” 
he said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Niko Arranz, a student protestor, said 
the counter teach-in was more pow-

erful than the one the administration 
had planned.

“The first teach-in was a joke,” he 
said. “I was falling asleep because it 
wasn’t relevant.”

Keflezighi said she created the 
counter teach-in because she wanted 
to educate the community according 
to BSU’s own terms. 

“We were angry when we weren’t 
asked to be part of the [teach-in] 
planning process,” she said. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Penny Rue responded positively to 
the counter teach-in. 

“I’m delighted that our students 
found the right platform to express 
themselves today,” she said. 

She said it was too soon to know 
if all of the demands of the BSU will 
be met.

The remaining spaces were meant to 
provide alternative services to students, 
as outlined in the referendum.

University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said he plans to install a 
hair salon on the second level of the 
building. A coffee shop, scheduled to 
open next winter, has been assigned to 
the space left of the Sunshine Market. 
A bank — whose name has yet to be 
released — will open to the right of the 
Sunshine Market by fall. According to 
Terzino, of the three, the bank is the 
furthest along in the planning and 
contracting stages.

The Department of Student Life 
issued a survey five years ago — before 

contracting out the spaces — to collect 
information on student preferences 
and determine which potential vendors 
would best accommodate their needs.

“In the spring of 2005, a survey 
was issued to the campus community,” 
Terzino said. “Over 4,000 responses 
came back. The responses from that 
survey really helped fuel the vendors 
that were considered in the expansion.”

Terzino said he worked with 
the University Centers Advisory 
Board, made up of students and 
administrators, to negotiate with 
potential businesses.

“The process does take time, 
because we have to essentially figure 
out what would be the best business 

to go in there,” UCAB Chair Jordan 
Taylor said. Once UCAB receives 
proposals from interested businesses, it 
reviews each one in detail to determine 
its potential.

“We go through a reviewing 
process of all the proposals with the 
commitee, and then we decide which 
ones we want to enter into more 
specific negotiations,” Taylor said. 

Ratcliff said the process, though 
lengthy, was necessary to ensure 
student satisfaction.

“The board is very careful,” Ratcliff 
said.

with being recorded, and no one raised 
their hand.” 

Dadourian was still denied access, 
though he said other members of the 
forum were recording videos.

The free-speech issue was discussed 
at the A.S. meeting last night. Various 
guests — including Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary Ratcliff — asked the 
council to continue the freeze until new 
guidelines were created.  

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch said that 
the council is also working with legal 
counsel, who has assured them that 
the freeze is not a violation of rights 
because it did not single out the Koala.

“Legal counsel is assuring us that 
there are mechanisms we can put in 
place so that we do not work against 
ourselves with hate speech, [simply] 
because of structures we have in place,” 
Benesch said.  

Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Ang said freez-
ing funds is not violating the First 
Amendment. 

“It’s not our fault they didn’t find 
other sources in previous years,” he said.

Sixth College Senator John 
Condello disagreed.

“These organizations are funded by 
[the council], so pulling funding [will 
amount to] silencing them,” he said. 
“The answer is more speech, not less.”

The council voted to maintain the 
funding freeze until discussed by the 
campus media committee. The com-
mittee, open to the public, is meeting 
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the A.S. Forum 
on the fourth floor of Price Center East.

MARCH 1-4, 2010

In light of the day’s teach-ins and last week’s student-media funding freeze, the Week 8 
A.S. Council meeting was the most 
intense of the year so far. 

During public input, individuals 
from both the Black Student Union 
and media organizations addressed 
the council in hopes of influencing a 
future decision on the freeze.

Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of 
Students Affairs 
Gary Ratcliff 
displayed his 
contempt for the 
Koala.

“I’ve seen this 
for 10 years, where you allow student 
publications to fund hate,” he said. 
“Meanwhile, you are watering that 
weed with $7,000 — let [the Koala] 
use their own beer money to fund 
themselves.” 

Koala Editor in Chief Kris 
Gregorian arrived at the meeting 
wielding $20 in pennies to demon-
strate that students are free to ask for 
reimbursement of their fees that go 
toward the Koala.

As the council motioned to move 
to New Business, it voted to maintain 
the temporary freeze and discuss the 
topic at the campus media review 
committee meeting 8 p.m. Thursday.

Next, Student-Run Television co-
manager Thomas Dadourian begged 
the council to reopen the station. 

Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo said the SRTV shutdown paled 
in comparison to larger issues.

“Your voice may be silenced tem-
porarily, but as a student of color on 
this campus, my voice is silenced per-
manently,” she said.

The motion to reinstate SRTV’s 
charter, with an amendment banning 
live shows, failed.

AVP of Diversity Affairs Jasmine 

Phillips spoke to AVP of Academic 
Affairs and Pi Kappa Alpha member 
Jordan Taylor regarding the racial 
incident at their meeting Sunday.

“PIKE is not taking accountability, 
they just attempt to cover their own 
asses,” Phillips said. “But they have 
had a lack of action and a nonchalant 
attitude.”

Taylor was visibly shaking and 
upset as he lis-
tened to Phillips’ 
speech. 

Last week, 
councilmembers 
moved to cre-
ate a committee 
to bridge the 

gap between the Greek community 
and the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, but did not determine 
how the council would oversee the 
committee.  

This week, council voted to insti-
tute Briana Boyd from Counseling 
and Psychological Services as the 
committee’s chair. 

During member reports, 
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy announced he would not 
wear shoes for two weeks to raise 
money for Partners in Health and 
Haiti relief.

President Utsav Gupta informed 
the council that the Graduate 
Student Association failed the 
University Centers CPI referendum 
that the council passed last week.  

VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch excitedly announced 
that the Grove Cafe will take dining 
dollars starting in spring.

And, as always, what would an 
A.S. meeting be without the repeat-
ed issue of council accountability? 

After a relatively brief debate, 
councilmembers voted to impeach 
Sixth College Senator Kevin 
Nguyen, who was notably absent.

Thanks to the work of Dr. William 
Gerwick at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, UCSD’s nine libraries 
and three million books will soon have 
a new baby sibling: the SIO collection.

Gerwick, along with George 
Nicola, a postdoctoral scholar at 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy, plans to 
open the Scripps Natural Compounds 
Library by 2012 in order to stream-
line the way drug companies obtain 
research material. The library — 
which will be comprised of marine 
plant samples, animals and bacteria 
— already contains over 50,000 speci-
mens waiting to be catalogued.

Gerwick first envisioned the 
project five years ago, when he came 
across the work of late marine chemis-
try professor John Faulkner. Faulkner 
left behind a vast collection of com-
pounds, collected from locations 
around the world like Madagascar, 
Papua New Guinea and Fiji; however, 
they were highly disorganized, lacking 

proper catalogue and supervision.
“I realized what an asset we have 

here at SIO and UCSD, but how poor-
ly we manage it,” Gerwick said. “For 
the long vision, it would be of enor-
mous value to the institution to have 
a large and well-curated compound 
collection.”

Gerwick said he hopes to orga-
nize the collection of natural and 
synthetic compounds within the next 
two years — readying it for use, espe-
cially, by pharmaceutical companies. 
Additionally, Gerwick has asked for 
sample donations from scientists at 
Scripps and other institutions who 
might want to contribute to the grow-
ing collection. 

Gerwick said the completed 
library should allow drug compa-
nies to avoid the laborious process 
of obtaining individual compounds, 
which can mean excessive paperwork 
and legal complications. For example, 
each time a pharmaceutical company 
requests to use a compound from a 
different institution, it must create a 
legal agreement for its application, 
including a system of payment. 

According to 

Nicola, easy access to compounds 
gives pharmaceutical companies flex-
ibility to examine new compounds 
on a budget, and encourages them to 
work with UCSD. In particular, Nicola 
said the library’s location at the ocean-
ography institute will aid marine-
oriented research.

“The most important aspect of this 
screening library is that they originate 
from very rare marine sources,” Nicola 
said. “In this sense, it will revolution-
ize scientific drug discovery by tap-
ping into the unique biodiversity that 
is intrinsic to these rare species.”

One of the most prominent syn-
thetic compounds in the collection 
is cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. 
These photosynthetic bacteria  — 
which are generated by Scripps scien-
tists in the lab after cyanobacteria are 
collected in the field  — could be the 
source of bioactive products, used in 
medical disciplines like the neurosci-
ences, bacteriology and oncology.

In January, the Scripps-Young 
President’s Organization Innovation 
Challenge awarded the collection 
a $10,000 cash prize because of the 
library’s potential contributions to the 
field of medicine. 

The Scripps library will not 
generate profit for the university. 
Gerwick said he is aiming to create 
a self-sustaining facility, and accord-
ing to Nicola, it will create ties with 
academic laboratories and drug com-
panies interested in working with the 
collection. 

“Hopefully this will simulate a 
company with a different idea for the 
good of society,” Gerwick said. “This 
library shows that there are other ways 
to develop drugs, and once we build

Flops to Gerard Kemkers, Olympic speed-skating coach of Sven
Kramer, for telling him to skate in the wrong lane of his race,
disqualifying him from a world-record title and a gold medal.  

Props to the Grove for deciding to once again accept dining 
dollars, so we don’t have to walk all the way to Plaza on the 
Side every time we get the munchies.

Like all great men of science, I do my best thinking on the toi-let. I’m more focused. I’m more 
alert. I’m usually not wearing pants. 
For me, a bowel movement is a time 
for deep reflection, an opportunity to 
ponder the unremitting mysteries of 
the universe — like why nations go to 
war, how societies develop or why my 
roommate always puts the damn toilet 
paper on the roll backwards. Seriously, 
Peter. Come on, man.

So when the Conservative 

Political Action Conference came to 
a close last week — a moment car-
ried by the impassioned chalkboard 
stylings of self-proclaimed rodeo 
clown Glenn Beck — I immediately 
hit the John. I had just witnessed 
three days of extremist anger, the 
inklings of anti-establishment 
upheaval and a staggering array of 
pinstriped suiting. I had seen House 
Minority Leader John Boehner 
predict a fast-approaching political 
rebellion. I had watched soft-spoken 
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty 
swing an imaginary golf club as he 
“smashed the windows” of big gov-
ernment. I had listened as Sen. Jim 
DeMint (R-S.C.) proclaimed that the 
American people were ready to go to 
battle against the Democratic Party. 

Battle? Rebellion? Smash? 
Window? What was going on here? 
Why were elected officials alluding to 
violent political uprising? Since when 
did frothing at the mouth become 
an acceptable mode of political com-
munication? And why were people 
buying big posters of Anne Coulter in 
a suggestive pose? Is Anne Coulter hot 
now? When the hell did Anne Coulter 
become hot?

I was going to be in the bathroom 
for a while.

It’s apparent that a lot of people 
in this country are exceptionally 
pissed off with our government at 
the moment, and with good reason. 
Apart from this week’s miraculous 
passage of the “jobs, jobs, jobs” bill, 
Congress has pretty much grinded 
to a stubborn partisan standstill. 
Combine that with our flailing 
economy, a sustained national fear of 
terrorism and an executive propos-
ing nearly a trillion dollars in new 
spending over the next 10 years, and 
you’re bound to get a few folks riled 
up. Some of them might even dress 
up in three-cornered hats and shoes 
with buckles — a look I have always 
wished I could pull off.

But what these worried masses 
seem to forget is that our country 
is not a dictatorship or a military 
state and that our president is not a 
totalitarian communist neo-liberal 
monarch, as certain talk show hosts/
political rabble rousers would have us 
believe. We’re living in a democracy, 
here, and a pretty good one at that. 
There’s no need to load up your guns. 
There’s no need to incite a rebellion. 
Voting and peaceful demonstrations 
work just as well. The violent rhetoric 
that so many conservative icons are 
tossing around at the moment is dan-
gerous. It’s the kind of language that 
drives people to do crazy, desperate 
things in the name of some elusive 
condition called “freedom.”

We have freedom. What we don’t 
have is toilet paper. Damnit, Peter.

he question of whether we 
should enforce affirmative 
action at the University of 

California — one of the most conten-
tious and drawn-out issues of our 
generation — has never been more 
relevant. 

Yesterday, approximately 400 stu-
dents from the Southern California 
area joined in a Black Student Union-
led protest to address racism on cam-
pus. They asked Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox to comply with a list of 
demands that would increase outreach 
efforts on campus, expressing hurt 
and alienation over the frat-affiliated 
“Compton Cookout” party and the 
racial slur made on Koala TV last 
Thursday.

Though BSU is correct in believing 
it must attack underrepresentation by 
way of changed policy, not all of their 
demands are fiscally feasible. There’s 
only so much funding Chancellor Fox 
can put aside for a resource center 
or an art space after systemwide cuts 
have left us with mere scraps of an 
already depleted budget. However, 
we can more realistically attack the 

problem at its source by immediately 
tweaking our admissions process.

Of course, it isn’t legal to con-
sider race in admissions just yet. But, 
thanks to the actions of student-based 
coalition “By Any Means Necessary,” 
that might change. Earlier this month, 
BAMN filed a class-action lawsuit 
to overturn Proposition 209 — the 

1996 law that 
banned affirma-
tive action at 
all California 
public universi-
ties. According 
to the organiza-
tion, because of 
the precedent 
set by 2003 
Supreme Court 
case Grutter 
v. Bollinger — 
which declared 
affirmative 
action both nec-

essary and legal — BAMN has a good 
chance of overturning Prop. 209.

We hope that’s the case, and urge 
students to funnel whatever energy 

they have after parading Price Center’s 
perimeters this year and channel it 
into helping level the playing field at a 
legislative level.

The fewer minority students there 
are at UCSD, the more other students 
will think events like the Cookout are 
no big deal. Without a challenge to 
the privileged point of view, the more 
graduates we release to the world 
without a trace of cultural sensitivity.

While we’re waiting on BAMN’s 
lawsuit, however, we recommend 
that the university do what it can 
within its limitations. Currently, all 
UC campuses save UCLA and UC 
Berkeley make admissions decisions 
based on a comprehensive system 
that awards each applicant a certain 
number of points according to his or 
her academic record, economic status 
and personal achievements. At UCSD 
specifically, an applicant’s academic 
record makes up for 74 percent of his 
or her score — meaning those who 
don’t earn enough points based on 
their GPA or SAT scores won’t even 
get a chance to be reviewed for per-
sonal achievements.

The holistic review that UCLA and 
Berkeley use, however, avoids forcing 
a value on any one aspect of an appli-
cation, and assesses candidates based 
on all factors of their application. Even

I would like to thank everyone for their support, and for standing in solidarity with the commu-
nity against hate speech and for the 
human right to be respected.

At first, I felt really discouraged 
because it felt like many people were 
supporting this ill-intentioned “free 
speech,” and were so reluctant to 
sympathize with the racial hostility 
that I and many others on this cam-
pus have felt because of — and even 
before — these incidents. 

But after Feb. 24, 2010, I am 
more than confident that there are 
many non-ignorant people here 
at UCSD who, like me, realize the 
necessity of mutual respect in a 

public space shared by a variety 
of people of many affiliations and 
backgrounds. We stand in solidarity 
against these acts of hate, and will 
not tolerate them on this campus or 
any other publicly social atmosphere 
of our community — that includes 
Facebook and public fraternity 
activities.

The “Compton Cookout” invita-
tion and party is a perfect example 
of externalizing subconsciously 
internalized stereotypes of American 
black culture, taken from the media 
and used as comedy for a party 
in celebration of Black History 
Month. For those who do not take 
this month seriously, this may have 
seemed like a harmless and humor-
ous excuse to throw a party. Yet for 
others, it was horrifying; for those 

that understand Black History 
Month as a time to honor American 
black culture in ceremony of respect 
and appreciation, and a time to 
recognize suffering and accomplish-
ments, this party was disrespectful 
on so many levels.

Even if it had not been the month 
of February, the event would have 
still been disrespectful, because 
the invitation and party itself was 
a mockery of low socio-economic 
status and a degradation of Black 
women. Imitation is a form of 
flattery and respect, a way of high-
lighting positive characteristics 
— but mockery is intended to be 
offensive, and shows an ignorant 
lack of respect for the subjects one 
is portraying. As a black woman, I 
was appalled, and honestly do not 

feel entirely safe walking around a 
campus where people could find it 
within their capacity to base a party 
on misogyny and malicious stereo-
types.

This so-called representation of 
black culture by a group of fraternity 
members was based on their limited 
knowledge of it, and just goes to 
show how ignorant they truly are 
about the black community.  Am I 
really surrounded by such unedu-
cated people? 

I can still hear it. “Well, if black 
people weren’t so offended and 
accepted it as a joke, there wouldn’t 
be a problem.” This “joke” implies 
all poor black people are uneducated 
and animalistic, with no manners.

OPINION� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Dear Editor, 
As educators, advisors and out-

reach professionals who work off 
campus in historically marginal-
ized communities, TRIO Outreach 
Programs is sending this open 
letter in solidarity with the Black 
Student Union and others who are 
expressing their frustrations, and 
are asking for immediate action.  
An outrageously racist party took 
place, UCSD students were involved 
and we expect those students to 
be held accountable for their gross 
violations. We also acknowledge 
that there is a larger systemic 
problem with the campus climate 
at UCSD that has to be addressed, 
as expressed in a recent statement 
from Dr. Jorge Mariscal and Dr. 
Patrick Velasquez.  

With respect, we think the 
campus should take the following 
measures to continue to address this 
larger issue of continued hostility 
toward communities of color:

Budget decisions — Programs 
that serve underrepresented stu-
dents should be given consideration 
to the value that they add to the 
campus, and these programs need 
to be considered as part of the larg-
er goal of promoting diversity.

Admissions policies — The 
recent WASC recommendations 
included efforts to implement a 
holistic approach for UCSD, and 
we encourage the university to 
take steps in this critical aspect of 
looking at what types of students’ 
comprehensive life experiences the 
campus values. 

Develop a major for African 
American and Chicana/o Studies — 
Majors and minors which promote 
interdisciplinary research and study 

in fields such as African American 
Studies and Chicana/o Studies will 
make significant progress toward 
demonstrating the university’s 
priority in the attraction of and 
retention of historically underrepre-
sented communities.

Student initiated programs — 
Every effort needs to be taken to 
develop, support and maintain 
the recently developed Student 
Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service.

Create a social justice and com-
munity building taskforce — The 
university should provide a com-
prehensive space so that a variety of 
people from various units, depart-
ments and expertise can contribute 
to taking concrete steps to address 
the need to build and sustain social 
justice and community building 
efforts at UCSD. These efforts could 
focus on the critical needs of his-
torically underrepresented popula-
tions.

It is imperative that we send a 
strong message to those commu-
nities that have been historically 
excluded from higher education 
that this is their campus, too.

— Carri Fierro 
Director, UCSD TRIO

Outreach Programs

Dear Editor,
As an alumnus and faculty 

member, I am saddened by the 
mean-spirited actions recently 
directed toward the black com-
munity, and especially attempts to 
justify behavior that was demeaning 
to members of our community. I 
see these actions as those of a small, 

if, say, an applicant’s academic SAT 
score is low because he couldn’t afford 
a prep course or find time to study 
while helping his parents pay the bills, 
his evaluators would still be able to 
consider him based on other merits. 
Accordingly, UCLA and Berkeley 
have more than double, almost triple, 
our 1.3 percent of black students. 

And let’s face it. The way we deal 
with everyday challenges almost 
always says more about our ability to 
learn and adapt to difficult situations 
(i.e. blazing through with two weeks 
of midterms on top of a part-time job) 
than the grade you weaseled out in 
AP History.

It’s true that such a prestigious 

institution of higher learning as 
UCSD should value academic record 
very highly in the admissions pro-
cess. But if you really think about 
it, no matter how many worksheets 
on chemical titration you filled out 
in high school, you probably don’t 
remember any of it now. Your high-
school resume often has more to do 
with the resources and encourage-
ment you received — opportunities 
far from equal in California’s fund-
biased education system.

So, we hope that Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae 
Brown means it when she says that 
her department will be launching a 
pilot program incorporating holis-
tic review next year. Far more than 

punishing frat boys or student media, 
a new system would foster campus 
diversity and, therefore, awareness. 

Our student population is in a 
state of obvious disproportionality 
— one for which no safe space nor 
free tutoring session can compensate. 
Starting-line coexistance is the only 
answer. If UCSD were to eventually 
incorporate a form of affirmative 
action into its admissions process, 
should Prop. 209 be overturned, the 
holistic system would be more likely 
to ensure that applicants aren’t simply 
receiving points for race, in isolation 
from experience. Rather, race could be 
considered within the context of any 
other strengths or weaknesses, advan-
tages or disadvantage.

HiATUSTONIGHTIf you can’t wait for the World Cup, check out the irreverent Mexican soccer comedy “Rudo y Cursi” from director Alfonso Cuarón of “Y Tu Mama También” 
at 8 p.m. at the Loft.

By Gretchen Wegrich
Staff Writer

It may be grim, but there’s enough humor in Anton Chekhov’s dark comedy “The 
Seagull,” this week’s headliner at 
Mandell Weiss Forum, that you 
can leave your Prozac at home. 
Silly and sad, it’s perfect date fod-
der for a mismatched couple.

Konstantin, a young and unap-
preciated playwright, is at the 
center of a messy love pentagon 
that wreaks havoc in his small 
lakeside community — but their 
amorous and ridiculous down-
fall is so hilarious that it’s easy 
to forget that things are going to 
pieces, distractions ranging from 
red Speedos to upbeat musical 
blowouts.

Although sometimes jarring, 
these periodic song-and-instru-
ment interruptions provide a 
much-appreciated escape from the 
play’s increasingly grim develop-
ments.

But it’s the thought-provoking 
commentary on art that makes 
the first act so appealing. When 
Konstantin tries to push the 
boundaries of theatrical structure 
by removing all plot and charac-
ters, “The Seagull” tiptoes around 
irony, suggesting the plot-and-
character-driven theater we were 
watching was too conventional to 
be considered interesting or art.   

The much shorter second act 
dives into a deep, dark depression. 
A number of years have passed, 
and the characters’ vibrantly 
colored costumes give way to grays 
and blacks.

Although Konstantin and his 
companions have followed their 
dreams, nothing seems to have 

turned out the way they once 
hoped. Each has learned the hard 
way that you can’t just ignore an 
impossible 
love, no 
matter how 
you may try.

As the 
play veers 
toward its 
dark end, the 
cast struggles 
to maintain 
the holiday atmosphere that once 
pervaded their lives, wondering 
what will come of their uncertain 
lives.

Driven by complex 
personalities that are alternately 
proud, vain, miserable, flirtatious, 
discouraged, jealous, passionate 

and desperately in love, “Seagull” 
boasts neither villain nor 
protagonist — just a motley mix 

of character 
flaws, each 
relatable in its 
way. Dugdale 
successfully 
adapts 
Chekhov’s 
play with a 
zest of modern 
context and 

zinging musical talent. Stage 
lighting adds subtle visual context 
to the emotional weight of each 
scene, while a crafty set leaves 
space open for the characters to 
romp through to their unhappy 
endings.

I f you’ve never experienced a Mandeville Center cultural event, consider giving conceptual artist 
Lauren Woods’ multimedia exhibit 
“M(other)land” a quick peek the 
next time you find yourself near 
Main Gym. 

While the messages behind 
some of her videos and images are 
sometimes hard to grapple, a long 
look at the new exhibit reveals the 
Bay Area artist’s fascination with 
the identity of power that sur-
rounds the American perspective 
of Africa.

‘WHAT IS AFRICA?’
BY GRETCHEN WEGRICH

‘I Just Love You More’
Kate Nash
FICTION RECORDS

I n her latest single, Kate Nash puts a psychedelic twist on her Joan Jett ’tude, layering enough 
power and effects to crack our 
skulls open. A complete 180 from 
her folksy debut, the track’s watery 
bass slithers behind Nash’s hazy 
and echoed voice as the guitars 
scrape out a riff trippy enough to 
give David Gilmour flashbacks. 
She launches the choruses into 

freak-out territory with wordless, 
glass-shattering shrieks, keeping 
the broken-brain train rolling from 
verse to verse.

Even though Nash’s psychedelic 
grit stings, if the alternative is one 
of a thousand sweet, synthetic 
divas — hell, I’ll admit it: I prefer it 
rough and ragged.

— Bryan Kim
Staff  Writer

‘Art Czars’
Japandroids
POLYVINYL RECORDS

T he guitar-and-drums simplic-ity of the Japandroids’ new “Art Czars” harkens back to high 
school, when we’d pay $2 to see a 
friend of a friend’s shitty band play 
in the garage. Only here, that band’s 
suddenly kind of good. Unlike the 
hometown mediocrities littering 
MySpace, Japandroids’ Post-Nothing 
— a noise-rock riposte to the flood 
of electronic indie-rock — is one of 

the most acclaimed albums of 2009. 
The raucous, snarky track has the 
band repeatedly chanting lines like, 
“Here’s your money back/ Here’s 
your punk rock back.” It’s almost 
embarrassingly angst-ridden, but 
Japandroids make it so catchy it’s 
sort of forgivable. Plus, they’re com-
ing to the House of Blues on April 1.

TRACKREVIEWS

T hanks to blogs, finding dope jams is really easy now. The flipside of this buttery bread, however, is the 
deluge of shit to listen to. There are 
music blogs for every subgenre you 
can concoct — hundreds thrown into 
the “chillwave” and “glo-fi” categories 
alone. But I’ll gloss over that hipster 
chaff and focus on a few groups that 

may blossom further than premature 
web-hype ejaculation. In the near 
future, bands will deserve more than a 
hundred-word blurb and a free down-
load. But for now they’re stuck with 
the Wavves’ and Neon Indians of the 
fickle Net news-cycle.

Eternal Summers. This Virginian 
pared-down duo of Nicole and Daniel 
recalls the White Stripes if they were a 
dream-pop band with a chick singer. 
These two learned how to play their 
instruments only a few years ago with 
an aim of unadorned and melody-rich 
classic songwriting. “Lightswitch,” a 
standout track from their self-titled EP,

ULTRAZONE — The Ultimate Laser Adventure

F or a band that made a mark with a power-metal portrayal of the 
Hiroshima ruins by the 
name of “Black Rain,” Astral 
Doors’ new Requiem of Time 
is as forgettable as the parade 
of Black Sabbath vocalists 
after Dio left. The Swedish 
rockers plod through same-
speed grinding rhythms 
ripped straight from classic 
fantasy-metal bands, and 
every twist — like the pre-
solo acoustic breakdown 
in “Blood River” — is 100 
percent expected. No mat-
ter how carefully you listen, 
there’s none of the awe and 
mysticism that transformed 
the classics from just plain 
heavy into metal. 

Even instrumentally, 
the album can’t distinguish 
itself: Mike Itäranta’s bass is 
turned so low that he might 
as well be six feet under, 
while the twin guitarists 
trade tentative solos, reluc-
tant to leave their comfy 

power-chord rhythms. 
Instead, an electro-clink 
keyboard takes the lead on 
“The Healer,” but rather 
than serving as a roaring 
foundation for the track, it 
just fills an empty space.

The only member of 
Astral Doors who really 
taps into the power of metal 
is vocalist Nils Johansson, 
whose forceful singing 
dominates “Call of the 
Wild” with Dio’s brand of 
commanding, condemning 
contralto. With a little more 
imagination, his voice could 
make Astral Doors the next 
Judas Priest, but his range 
is wasted on trite, overdone 
metal anthems with names 
like “Testament of Rock.” 
Especially in a world where 
most of heavy metal’s god-
fathers are still putting out 
fresh and deadly tracks, why 
bother with a cheap knock-
off that’s stuck in 1979?

ALBUMREVIEW

gallery, peaceful choral music fills our 
ears, the only presence in a spacious 
white room. If you can resist the urge to 
curl up in the corner and sleep off last 
night’s party, your eyes will be drawn to 
several screens.

To your left is a large projection of 
hip-hop king Ludacris haloed by golden 
light, superimposed on a stereotypi-
cal African backdrop — grass huts, an 
elephant, a kneeling woman holding a 
basket and a tribal warrior with a spear. 
Woods asks us to deconstruct our media-
influenced stereotypes of Africa, while 
Ludacris’ shirt us a resonating Marcus 
Garvey quote: “A people without knowl-
edge of its past is like a tree without 
roots.” 

Working your way clockwise around 
the room, you’ll find the back corner 
partitioned off. There, a double projec-

tion in blue, black and white features 
a Hollywood-constructed image of 
stampeding African men in loincloths. 
Because it’s projected onto two walls at a 
right angle, it looks like the horde is run-
ning directly toward us.

It’s not immediately recognizable, but 
the installation is also interactive: You 
can add your own twist to the exhibit by 
standing in front of the projector. Just 
make sure the curator doesn’t catch you 
fooling around with your shadow. 

Further along the back wall are two 
blurry nature photographs, each with 
a black rectangle obscuring part of the 
image. Headphones provide an eclectic 
safari-inspired soundtrack for your lis-
tening pleasure. The obscure handful of 
stimuli could mean a lot of things, but 
the gallery brochure explains that these 
photographs are part of the “Vortex” 
series: a response and reformulation of 

“the idea of Africa.” 
The back of the gallery contains sev-

eral more “Vortex” pieces to fall into, 
while a dark back room juxtaposes dis-
turbing screams and flashing machine-
gun recordings. The installation’s final 
eye-catcher is a five-screen setup that 
displays clips of the African coastline as 
portrayed by Western media.

Known for her multidisciplinary work 
combining video, sound, installation and 
photography to deconstruct pop culture, 
race and other social constructs, Woods’ 
“M(other)land” is no exception — and it’s 
the first time her body of work, known 
as “The Africa Archives,” has been shown 
all together. Don’t miss it. 

The artist will give a talk about her 
work on March 2 at 6:30 p.m. in the VAF 
Performing Arts Space. “M(other)land” will 
be on display Tuesday through Saturday 
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. until March 20.

wispy harmonies for a minute and a bit 
before fading out. When their debut LP 
drops later this year, indie big leagues will 
be touting their name.

The Morning Benders. These pop 
youngsters opened for Girls at the Loft last 
December, but they’ve been around for a 
few years culling Shins-heavy jangles up 
in SF. Their second record, Big Echo, as 
fellow columnist Philip Rhie put it, “is like 
Veckatimest’s bastard child,” but in the best 
possible way. Grizzly Bear’s bassist, Chris 
Taylor, produced the new recordings and it 
shows — the reverb-heavy toms, crunchy 
guitar tones and ghost-harmonizing of 
lead single “Promises” spins Bear for the 
California beach set. They might not be 

the most original outfit, but they’ve got 
pop on lock.

Hudson Mohawke. And now the wild-
card outlier: England’s precocious producer 
Ross Birchard, aka Mohawke, comes from 
the same cartoon sugar-cereal generation as 
Flying Lotus and Nosaj Thing, with video-
games and commercial jingles on the brain. 
His Warp Recs debut Butter blends Flying 
Lotus beat-chopping with Dan Deacon’s 
hyper chipmunk aesthetic, using cheesy 
synth lines and cracked-out vox samples to 
dizzying effect. He’s also mastered the ’90s 
slow jam, employing Dam-Funk’s sultry 
vocal prowess on techno-soul banger “Tell 
Me What You Want From Me.” This young 
Brit may have some crossover appeal — 
FlyLo’s doing a track with Thom Yorke this 

year, so who knows, HudMo might get 
Weezy or Gucci on a verse someday.

Oneohtrix Point Never. What! How do 
you pronounce that? I have no idea. What 
I do know about this mysterious project 
is the brain’s name, Daniel Lopatin, whose 
style is barren synth ambience overloaded 
for headphone-listening pleasure. Imagine 
if Yanni circuit-bent his ’80s keyboard 
arsenal until it sounded in-the-red crispy, 
then composed the soundtrack to “2001: 
A Space Odyssey.” Tracks like “Physical 
Memory” evoke the Mad Max desert 
future we all secretly hope California 
won’t become. This artist may never reach 
an audience outside of niche drone and 
electronic circles, but his newest collection 
Rifts is years ahead of its time.

disrespectful minority. I do not 
know if these actions are protected 
by free speech, but they clearly vio-
late our principles of community. 
More importantly, they do not rep-
resent the UCSD I know. 

I teach a large, sophomore-level 
course in which students work 
closely together in teams. These 
teams are randomly assigned, 
and I have seen students from all 
backgrounds work respectfully 
and effectively together. We have 
students from varied cultural back-
grounds, many whose first language 
is not English, and many who did 
not have the benefit of privileged 
high schools. As a whole, students 
treat each other with respect — 
regardless of their backgrounds 
— and strive to create a positive 
student experience at UCSD. When 
members of our community have 
been demeaned, it is the respon-
sibility of all of us to stand up and 
reaffirm our commitment to a 
respectful environment. The admin-
istration’s actions are important, but 
even more critical are the actions of 
the UCSD community as a whole to 
demonstrate the best of the UCSD 
that I know.

 — Nathan Delson
Academic Coordinator, 

Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering

Dear Editor,
As members of the department 

of ethnic studies at the University 
of San Diego, we would like to 
express our outrage over the recent 
“Compton Cookout” party. We do 
not pretend that UCSD is alone in 
having such incidents occur on its 
campus; all campuses in the county 

can probably point to such events. 
However, we believe that such hurt-
ful incidents can become teachable 
moments and lead to serious dis-
cussions about the lack of diversity 
on our campuses, the ongoing pres-
ence of racism, classism, heterosex-
ism and the factors fueling this kind 
of stereotyping and bias.

As serious as the brutal ste-
reotyping of the party invitation 
was, equally disturbing was the 
response. On a local radio show, 
callers assured the hosts that this 
was “light humor” and “youthful 
ignorance.” 

We would like to suggest some 
ways to move the discourse away 
from denial and the temptation to 
minimize by university administra-
tors:

1) In this post civil rights era, 
racist joking and humor are impor-
tant ways that racism is passed on 
and “taught.” These attitudes are 
learned and support the continu-
ation of US racial hierarchies and 
inequities. Those who challenge 
these notions are ridiculed as being 
“PC” or having no sense of humor. 
Such “humor” forms occasions for 
bonding for our young men (and 
some women).

2) We remain stuck if we con-
tinue to discuss these images in a 
historical way. Are we to believe 
that racism against blacks has noth-
ing to do with slavery, legal Jim 
Crow segregation, racial profiling 
and the like? To say so inspires the 
deep despair we saw in UCSD’s 
black students who were cynical 
that anything would be done about 
the incident. As long as they know 
this history and the majority of 
students do not, we will continue to 
speak past each other.

3) There is a persistent effort to 
deny any pattern with such inci-
dents. People assert that UCSD is a 

good place and that these are only a 
few bad apples (or even not-so-bad 
apples). This directly contradicts 
the evidence. There is a national 
spate of such “parties.” Boston 
College’s student newspaper, the 
Heights, has listed dozens of such 
parties. A “Ghetto Party” at a Texas 
university encouraged revelers to 
wear blackface and brandish guns. 
One wonders who is hosting all 
these events — just “rich kids” as 
the UCSD flyer notes?

4) There is cynicism and despair 
over the denial cited above and 
the lack of consequences. There 
is ample evidence that these are 
not isolated incidents, but rather 
national trends. Johns Hopkins 
University suspended a fraternity 
for its “Halloween in the Hood” 
party.

We encourage all San Diego 
county colleges and universities 
to use this event as a teachable 
moment and one with consequenc-
es. We are also deeply concerned 
about the effect of biased-related 
incidents on university enrollment 
for underrepresented groups; both 
UCSD and USD have black enroll-
ments under two percent. Finally, 
we join with you in dialoguing 
about these critical issues of hostile 
environment and lack of access to 
higher education.

Any realistic person would interpret 
this as extreme sarcasm — a rhe-
torical device used here to express 
contempt for black American cul-
ture. This was subconsciously abu-
sive behavior toward members of 
another race, or subliminal racism. 

Please realize that negative 
media representations produced 
about minority subjects are patri-
archal tools that perpetuate their 
oppression. Maybe if students were 
better educated in ethnic studies, 
or actually went out and affiliated 
themselves with other communi-
ties, they would understand that 
our oppression is real, and our 
pain is real. Stop contributing to 
the backbone of an institution that 
functions on injustice and inequal-
ity. Whiteness is not the problem — 
our entire capitalistic society is the 
problem. But when you add fuel to 
the engine, you make yourself part 
of the problem. 

The event created a hostile 
environment (although it was not 
on campus, it was hosted by UCSD 
students for UCSD students, so it 
reflects directly on the school) for 
a minority already underwhelming 
underrepresented and marginal-
ized in this area. Because of this 
unreceptive treatment by the few 
who seem to doubt that the party 
was insolent and fail to sympathize, 
we have become marginalized 
even more. The UCSD community 
should be shocked that it is contrib-
uting to the oppression of minori-
ties in 2010.

My only relief is that the situ-
ation has remained relatively civil 
and no one has been hurt, because 
in such aggressive atmospheres, vio-
lence is often inevitable. I’d bet that 
if violent behavior had occurred, 

people would not be calling it a 
“joke” anymore; they would realize 
that the words on the party invita-
tion and on Koala TV were fighting 
words, and not anything to be toyed 
with. Please, think of the conse-

quences of 
your actions, 
and take 
accountability 
for them.

Though 
hostility was 
not intended, 
the Compton 
Cookout initi-
ated racial 
hostilities for 
the personal 
gain of enjoy-
ment (at the 
expense, mind 
you, of many 
others’ subju-
gation), and is 

historically known as racism — aka 
hate speech. In challenge to the First 
Amendment, words that “by their 
very nature, involve danger to the 
public peace” become unconstitu-
tional (Justice Sanford, 1925 Gitlow 
v. New York.) I ask for support 
from my peers in achieving and 
retaining this peace by supporting 
the demands of the Black Student 
Union, which aim at stemming 
the intimidating climate of UCSD 
toward minorities and making this 
campus all of our campus. I have 
had enough of this shit, I will not 
get over it, and because you don’t 
think it is a big deal, I will make it a 
big fucking deal. I may only be part 
of 1.3 percent of this campus, but I 
matter. I will not give up.

To ﬁnd out how, just go to:  

zone, throwing more balls rather 
than strikes. 

“We needed to make them go 
fishing,” Gerckens said.

Experienced sophomore pitcher 
Camille Gaito and Zankich adjusted 
well to the changes, allowing only 
one Pioneer run. 

“It was a little rocky in the first 
game, but I just went out there with 
good confidence and made solid 
pitches,” Gaito said. “With the run 
support in these games, we came 
together as a team.”

Later in the sixth inning, UCSD 
scored again, plating two runs from 
just three hits. Junior outfielder Kris 
Lesovsky’s double to left field and 
senior catcher Nicole Saari’s triple 
down the infield line sent Lesovsky 
home.

Freshman infielder Nicole 
Spangler’s single down the infield 
line sent junior outfielder Lyndsay 
Gaylord home. Zankich shut out the 
last of the Pioneers for a 3-1 Triton 
victory. 

 “It was good to see both pitchers 
on the mound throwing great 
pitches,” Gerckens said.

The softball team’s experienced 
players had developed a workman-
like attitude by the third game of the 
series on Feb. 20. 

Fierce pitching from Gaito 
allowed East Bay only five hits and 
five players on base all game.

UCSD broke out the bats in the 
fourth inning. Nicole Saari’s single 
to right field after Kris Lesovsky’s 
triple to right field sent Lesovsky 
home. Gaylord’s double to the left 
center eventually brought her home 
from freshman infielder Dyanna 
Imoto’s bunted single. Senior 
shortstop Mandi Eliades’ and 
Lesovsky’s singles brought Gabriel 
home, giving UCSD the last run of 
the game for a 3-1 win. 

“We did a better job of executing 
our plays and had better defense,” 
Lesovsky said.

Going into the fourth game 
errorless, the Tritons’ energy waned, 
causing them to commit errors that 

gave the Pioneers their first win of 
the four-game series.

An error from the Tritons gave 
East Bay its first run in the second 
inning, and by the sixth inning, the 
Pioneers held the lead 4-1.

The Tritons’ late rally in 
the seventh inning brought the 
difference down to one run, and 
groundouts from Eliades and 
Lesovsky ended the game 3-4. 

“We waited too long in the fourth 
game,” Lesovsky said. “We just need 
to come off hitting early and leave 
less players on base.”

The team will start its eight-
game road trip at Rohnert Park 
facing off against Sonoma State for a 
two-day doubleheader from Feb. 26 
to Feb. 27. Sonoma State is currently 
3-1 in CCAA and 7-3 overall.

“We are starting to play higher-
ranked teams, and so we just need to 
prepare to take them on,” Gerckens 
said.

JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN
The UCSD softball team will rely on a stellar pitching staff to lead their road games against Sonoma State University and San Francisco State.

John clamped down after allowing 
four early runs to the Wildcats, 
pitching into the seventh inning 
with the lead.

He was followed by senior 
reliever Eric Abraham, who quickly 
allowed two Wildcat runners on 
base — warranting his substitution 
for sophomore reliever Elias Tuma.

Tuma entered the game at a tense 
a 7-7 game, with the bases loaded 
and one out in the top half of the 
second.

He answered the call brilliantly, 
escaping the inning after inducing 
a 1-2-3 double play and leaving the 
game all tied up.

In the bottom half of the eighth, 
Saul started things off for UCSD with 
a walk. Senior outfielder Chris Fung 
advanced Saul to first on a grounder, 
and after senior first baseman 
Brandon Gregorich was intentionally 
walked, a double steal by Saul and 
Gregorich put Triton men on second 
and third. 

After Kehoe was hit by a pitch, 
Benton stepped up to the plate with 
bases loaded and came through for 
UCSD with a sacrifice fly to center, 
propelling the Tritons to an 8-7 win 
and series split.

“One thing that we did very well 

was never giving up,” Lee said. “We 
were down a few runs at one point 
in each game, and we continuously 
fought back to make it [a] closer 
game, and even took the lead. That 
is one thing that exemplifies our 
program as a whole. We never let 
down, whether we are winning or 
losing.”

Tritons now sit at 11-3 overall 
and 2-2 in CCAA action. Chico State 
stands at 6-2 in CCAA play.

The Tritons will complete 
their homestand as they continue 
conference action against Cal State 
Monterey Bay University.

The Tritons then bring their string 
of successes up against the Otters.

Last season, the Tritons managed 
to win all four games in Seaside. The 
first pitch of the series is slotted for 
2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 26 at Triton 
Ballpark. 

“All we need to do is take care of 
the baseball on defense and capitalize 
on the offensive opportunities we 
have,” Lee said. “When we play the 
way we can, and stick to our overall 
approach as a team, we will be pretty 
tough to beat moving forward in the 
season.”

few bad holes for his disappointing 
performance.

“I’m just not playing as well as I’m 
used to,” he said.

It wasn’t just Okasaki that strug-
gled — senior Raj Samra, the team’s 
No. 2 golfer, finished five strokes 
behind Okasaki in a tie for 50th place. 

Junior Richard Morris, sopho-
more Mike Neustadt and freshman 
Anubhav Rastogi, all participating in 
the event for the first time, struggled 
in their maiden outing.

“A lot of our guys haven’t seen this 
type of course before,” Okasaki said. 
“We don’t have anything like it in San 
Diego. The other teams in the field 

usually play this type of course so they 
were expected to shoot better scores.”

UCSD will head to the two-day 
Cal State San Bernardino Invitational 
on March 1.

With the weather forecast predict-
ing heavy rains over the weekend, 
Wydra is just hoping to play a full 
54-hole event.

“We’re getting pretty used to the 
rain gear and umbrellas,” he said. 
“There’s a chance we’ll lose out on our 
practice round on Sunday, but if we 
get to play 54 holes, that would be a 
real treat.”

GOLF — Instead of fighting for a posi-
tion on the board, the UCSD men’s golf 
team found themselves fighting each 
other — with snowballs — on Feb. 23. A 
thick layer of snow blanketed the Grey 
Rock Golf Club in Austin, Tex., forcing 
officials to cancel the final round of the 
St. Edwards Invitational.

Battling the elements, UCSD fin-
ished in 12th place in a field of 14, with a 
65-over-par score. Junior Keith Okasaki 
finished in a tie for 28th place. 

This is the third event in the Triton 
season shortened due to weather condi-
tions. Rain plagued both the InterWest 
Wildcat Classic and the Sonoma State 
Invitational last October — but snow 
was a new challenge for head coach 
Mike Wydra the team.

“I can’t ever remembered being 
snowed out,” Wydra said, who is in his 
30th season with the Tritons. “I’m not a 
real big fan of snow.”

The Tritons were caught unprepared 
for the bitter cold, and it showed in their 
scores. With temperatures dropping 
into the mid-30s and only wind gear 
available, players struggled to find their 
rhythm while keeping warm.

“We were befuddled by the con-
ditions,” Wydra said. “[The cold] was 
unbearable during the first round, and 
uncomfortable during the second. We’re 
not used to playing in that kind of cold. 
I was still shivering even with all the lay-
ers that I could get on.”

Okasaki said it was difficult to prac-
tice in warm weather, only to face bliz-
zard-like conditions during the actual 
event. 

“It was 72 degrees during the practice 
round,” he said. “It dropped to the mid-
40s on Monday, then all the way to the 
30s on Tuesday. It’s frustrating when you 
travel to these events only to have them 
cut short by weather.”

After taking second place at the same 
event last season, Okasaki said he had 
hoped to perform better. Despite going 
two-under for the final seven holes, he 
fought the rhythm of his swing dur-
ing both Monday rounds. In what has 
turned into a season-long problem, 
Okasaki blamed poor ball striking and a

WOMEN DOMINATE THE DIAMOND
By Yvonne Chow� Staff Writer

The Triton softball team came into last weekend’s series against Cal State East Bay from Feb. 19 to Feb. 20 with 
little awareness of the threat the opposition 
would pose. Thanks to some improved 
defense and solid pitching and hitting, it 
didn’t matter. 

The Tritons tacked on three wins in 
their four-game series against the Pioneers, 
a team new to the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association this season, and which 
the Tritons haven’t played since 1992. The 
wins put UCSD at 5-3 in the CCAA and 7-5 
overall. 

“The players are getting to know their 
range through better communication,” head 
coach Patti Gerckens said. “They are getting 
stronger as a team progressively, which is 
very satisfying.” 

Overcoming a lack of experience with 
the Pioneers’ pitching and hitting abilities, 
UCSD went in strong from the start and 
easily won the first two games in the 
doubleheader on Feb. 19, with no errors on 
the board. 

“East Bay being a brand new team, it was 
a challenge,” Gerckens said. “But we learned 
as it came.”

In the first game, the Tritons charged 
ahead in the second inning with junior 
outfielder Rhiannon Ousley and junior 
infielder Jennifer De Fazio, sending two 
players home for a 2-0 lead. Later in the 
inning, junior outfielder Katrin Gabriel’s 
single to the pitcher brought in two runs 
by Ousley and sophomore outfielder Kellin 
Haley, boosting UCSD to a robust 4-0 lead. 

The Tritons were consistent in putting 

players on base, bringing in five more runs 
over the course of the game for a grand total 
of nine. Haley and De Fazio went two for 
two, each batting in a run.

The game ended in the fifth inning with 
the Pioneers unable to make a comeback, 
thanks to strong Triton defense on both the 
infield and outfield. 

UCSD defense stood strong in the second 
game: Senior pitcher Christine Zankich held 
the Pioneers back for three innings, and 
the rest of the team provided run support, 
knocking one in during the fourth inning 
for a 1-0 lead.

Gerckens said she had a specific strategy 
for pitching against the Pioneers: She asked 
Triton pitchers to pitch outside the strike

BASEBALL — The No. 3 nationally ranked 
UCSD men’s baseball team suffered a 
heartbreaking series opener when it hosted 
No. 23 Chico State at Triton Ballpark from 
Feb. 19 through Feb. 21. 

The Tritons opened CCAA play by 
carrying a 6-3 lead into the final frame, 
but the Triton wheels came off and the 
Wildcats came back for a 10-9 win against 
the UCSD bullpen.

Junior right-hander Tim Shibuya turned 
in a solid effort for UCSD, allowing four 
earned runs and striking out an impressive 
nine Wildcat hitters over 8.1 innings.

Despite carrying a lead into the ninth 
inning, a three-run home run dagger gave 
Chico an 8-6 lead which the team then 
built on with seven more ninth-inning 
runs for a 10-6 victory.

A three-run shot off the bat of junior 
outfielder Kyle Saul gave the Tritons one 
last gasp of breath in the bottom of the 
ninth, but they ended up falling one run 
short at 9-10.

Saul finished the game one single short 
of the cycle, going 3-5 with four RBIs.

“One adjustment we need to make as 

a team is to make sure that we dictate the 
tempo of the game and take our game to 
the other team,” Saul said. “As an offense, 
we need to make sure that we keep our 
approach at the plate for the entire game.”

The second game of the doubleheader 
— postponed to Saturday due to weather 
— ended in another win for Chico, who 
outlasted the Tritons through 11 innings to 
notch a 9-6 victory.

Senior catcher Kellen Lee’s cycle from 
the plate provided one of the few bright 
spots in the game for the Tritons in the 
extra inning battle, but wasn’t enough to 
defeat the Wildcats, who scored three runs 
in the 11th inning.

“One thing we did not do well was take 
advantage of our opportunities we had on 
offense with runners [in] scoring position,” 
Lee said. “Chico did come through in those 
situations. We just left too many people 
on base.”

The Tritons were eager to at least split 
the series with Chico, and dug deep in the 
final two games of the series, thanks to a 
series of strong pitching performances.

Immediately after the rescheduled 
game, the Tritons played another nine 
innings with more favorable results.

Senior right-hander Matt Rossman 

tossed a complete game for the 4-3 win.
Rossman got off to a slow start in 

the third game, giving up back-to-back 
doubles that led to two first-inning runs.

However after giving up three runs on 
six hits in the first two innings, Rossman 
settled down to shut the Wildcats out 
for the final seven innings, en route to a 
complete game victory.

The Tritons took the lead in the fifth 
inning when senior outfielder Robert 
Sedin doubled, and fellow senior shortstop 
Vance Albitz followed with a single.

Junior third-baseman Evan Kehoe then 
hit a sacrifice fly, giving the Tritons a 4-3 
lead.

Rossman struck out five and walked 
just two in the 4-3 victory, improving 
his record to 2-0 and pitching his first 
complete game of the season.

UCSD salvaged the series split by 
winning the fourth game 8-7 on Sunday.

After the Wildcats came out with a 
four-run lead in the second, hopes of a 
series split looked unlikely for the Tritons 
— but three runs in the third and three 
more in the fifth gave UCSD a 6-4 lead.
