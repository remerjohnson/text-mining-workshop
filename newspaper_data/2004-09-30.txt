Camejo holds campus rally 
Nader campaign kicks off write-in effort 

By PATlICK AWN 
Contributing Writer 

Independent vice-presidential 
candidate Peter Miguel Camejo 
railed against the Democratic and 
Republican parties at a Sept. 29 
rally at Price Center. 

The running mate of Ralph 
Nader, Camejo launched his , 
California write-in campaign by 
addressing a variety of issues rang-
ing from the war in Iraq to tuition 
hikes of UCSD students. 

"If the wealthiest five pt'rcent 
paid the same {in taxes] as the 
average {citizen], we'd have no 
deficit. We could tae bacle all of 
the ruition raises that have been 
given to you," he said. 

In his speech, Camejo out-
lined the stance of the Nader 
campaign on leey election issues, 
including foreign policy, univer-
sal health care, immigrant rights 
and taxes. 

TriMs BllVCuotd'on 
W1N.: ~ candidate Peter Miguel Camejo speaks at Price Cer1er. His 
appearance was the launch of the Ralph Nader '\Mite in Nader'" campaign. 

Camejo's appearance began a 
Southern California trip that 
includes UCLA and will culmi-
nate in his address to th~ 
Mexican American Political 
Association. Speaking in support 
of state drivers' licenses for 
undocumented workers currendy 
living and working in the coun-
try, Camejo said he hopes to cap-
ture these yotes, saying that the 
Democrats may have a "run for 
their money" among California's 

Latino voters. 
Camejo also spoke about his 

opposition to the conflict in 
Iraq. 

"The Nader campaign, in this 
election, represents the point of 
view of the overwhelming majori-
ty in the world, which is opposed 
to the U.S. occupation," Camejo 
said. 

At a rally foUowing the press 
briefing, he told students the cam-
paign placed priorities on civil lib-
erties. 

"The only candidate in this 

race for president who is opPosed 
to the [USA] Patriot Act and the 
war is Nader," he said. 

When asked by a student for 
his opinion on perceived incon-
sistencies by opponent Sen. John 
Kerry's (D-Mass.), Camejo called 
both Kerry and President 
George W. Bush "flip-floppers" 
for their positions. 

Camejo also urged voters to

Construction delays student center opening 
By SHANNON EUor 

Senior Staff \\\iter 

Due to an unexpected delay in 
planning and construction, 
Thurgood Marshall College stu-
dents wiU have to wait a bit longer 
for the opening of their widely 
anticipated new student center. and 
cafe. Originally scheduled to be 
operational by the beginning of 
fall quarter, the complex currendy 
has no set completion date. 

The idea of a new student cen-
ter was the joint creation of 
Marshall Student Affairs, 
Residential Life, and Housing and 
Dining Services. Housing and 
Dining Services is currendy 
housed in temporary office build-

ings, which must be vacated by 
2006. Planners favored the pro-
posal of relocating to the current 
student area at Eucalyptus Point 

"We had planned to complete 
the space exchange between 
[Housing and Dining Services] and 
TMC this sununer if we could get 
aU the facilities involved upgraded 
and completed by fall," Housing 
and Dining Director Mark. 
Cunningham said. "Unfortunately, 
the construction labor market in 
San Diego is too active with all the 
new construction and ~ rebuilding 
of aU the homes that were lost last 
year {in the fires] to find the folks we 
needed to do the work and have it 
done by opening."

have also required students to sac-
rifice the completion of housing 
renovation at the college, leaving 
many common areas unusable. 
His department could not see jus-
tification for such a decision, 
Cunningham said. 

"From my perspective, I didn't 
and don't think it is fair or reason-
able to ask residents to give up 
access to their limited 
meeting/common space in our 
housing during the school year, 
particularly when there was no 
immediate need to make the space 
exchange," he said. 

Despite the delay, Marshall 
Dean of Student Affairs Ashanti 
Houston Hands said she sees the 

. student center as an improvement 
to the campus environment. 

"Our areas were able to work 
together to come up with a plan 
that would help each department 
create spaces that would enhance 
community and positively impact 
our delivery of service," Hands 
said. "We are meeting to discuss 
our future plans, which include the 
new estimated opening."

Advisory council calls 
for UC national lab bids 

ByUSAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

University of California officials 
have come one step closer to decid-
ing on whether to continue manag-
ing the nation's nuclear laborato-
ries. At the Sept. 22 UC Board of 
Regents meeting, the UC 
President's Council on the 
National Laboratories recom-
mended that the university com-
bine with a corporate industrial 
partner and make a bid in the com-
petition for management of the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory and 
the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. 

The two laboratories are owned 
by the Deparnnent of Energy and 
have been managed by University 
of California since their inception. 
Built under the direction of UC 
physicist Robert Oppenheimer in 
1943, the Los Alamos lab adminis-
tered the first atomic bomb 
designs. The Livermore lab was 
established later in 1952 as another 
site for weapons design. 

A law was passed last year man-
dating that the labs, along with the 
UC-managed Lawrence Berkeley 

National Laboratory, seek compet-
itive bids for management rights. 
The regents will make a final deci-
sion on whether the university will 
bid after it receives and reviews the 
D .O.E.'s request for proposals, 
which will detail the department's 
expectations for management 
offers. 

"{Making a bid] is the long-term. 
normal default decision for all con-
cerned - the regents, the rue] 
president and the council ," said 
Herbert York, a member of the 
council and the former director of 
UCSD's Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation. 
"Something very special would be 
needed to change any minds." 

The university will consider a 
variety of factors in reviewing the 
D .O.E.'s requests and deciding 
whether to compete for the con-
tracts, including a focus on science, 
technology and research freedom, 
according to UC spokesman Chris 
Harrington . . 

A series of incidents in recent 
years have raised the question of 
whether the university is stiU quali-

Educators oppose new 
p~one tap regulations 
University Internet provider likely to pass 

on costs of new equipment to campus 
By PAUlO ALUM 

Contributing Writer 

An August ruling by the Federal 
Communications Commission 
could spell trouble for cash-
strapped universities and their stu-
dents, several education groups 
have warned. 

In a preliminary decision, the 
commission ruled that broadband 
Internet service providers should 
be responsible for maintaining the 
ability to intercept the orir' n, des-
tination and content 0 online 
broadband transmissions including 
phone calls made over the Internet. 
These calls were not originally 
included in a 1994 law requiring 
the telecommunication industry to 
maintain the ability to intercept the 
same information over traditional 
phone lines. 

The American Council on 
Education - a national lobby 
group that represents universities 
around the country, including 
UCSD - criticized the ruling in a 
statement . 

"AC.E. and the higher educa-
tion community support the need 
for law enforcement access to 
communications traffic under 
appropriate conditions," said 
Sheldon Steinbach, the group's 
vice president and general counsel,

in the statement. "Ho'wever, issues 
still remain: it will be incredibly 
expensive for colleges and univer-
sities to make their networks 
[compliant], not to mention the 
damper on innovation and the pri-
vacy issues that will need to be 
addressed. " 

In its ruling, the commission 
upheld a joint petition filed by fed-
eral law enforcement agencies to

I BRIEFLY 
Governor vetoes bill to 

limit tuition fees 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill 

that would have capped annual increases for 
fees charged by California's public universi-
ties. 

Written by Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La 
Canada Rintridge) and approved by a large 
majority in the state legislature, the bill would 
have forbid state universities from raising tuition 
fees by more than 8 percent in each academic 
year. The proposal also required that student 
fees at the University of California ·not exceed 
40 percent of the OIIerall cost of education and 
set 30 percent as the limit for CSU students. 

In addition, the bill charged the state gov-
ernment to ' bear the preponderance of 
responsibility for funding postsecondary educa-
tion." 

The governor said he could not sign the bill 
because it was "inconsistent with the student 
fee poli9' provisions of the higher education 
compact he signed with both university sys-
tems last spring. 

That decision may force the state to 'deny 
access to hisher education for all but the 
wealthiest Californians: Liu said in a statement. 

Students call for Jon 
Stewart's endorsement 

Half a dozen college students have 
launched an online petition calling for "Daily 
Show' host Jon Stewart to endorse a candidate 
in the 2004 presidential election. 

Admitting that few of the 40 million young 
voters ever make it to the polls, the petition 
says that the comedy show host's endorse-
ment 'would further legitimize political partici-
pation in the eyes of our generation.' The peti-
tion also allows students to add individual com-
ments. 

A January poll conducted by the Pew 
Research Center for the People and the Press 
found that more than one out of five people 
between the ages of 18 and 29 rely on comedy 
shows like the "Daily Show" and "Saturday Night 
Live" as one of their news sources. The amount 
was almost equal to the number of respondents 
who cited daily newspapers and networ.: news.

Master Plan for Higher 
Education outdated 

T he Master Plan for Higher Education lays out the frame-
work for public universities 
in California and directs UC 
campuses to accept only the 
top 12.5 percent of each 
graduating class. 

Many regents cited the 
1960 plan's limit in their 
decision to raise the mini-
mum GPA required for 
admission and effectively 
close the university's doors to 
750 qualified students each 
year, starting in fall 2007. 

However, the Master 
Plan's authors could not 
have imagined the modern 
service economy that has 
transformed our society and 
made a college degree prac-
ticalJy a prerequisite for a 
good job. 

Instead of a vision for gov-
ernance of the UC system, 
the plan has recently become 
a tool for politicians. The 
regents connnue to hold it up 
as the premier model of puo-
lie university planning for the 
nation, even as they ir:ore its 
original promise of tuition-

free [college education] to all 
residents of the state,» and 
continue to raise student fees. 

The board disregarded the 
Master Plan completely last 
spring to accommOdate Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
budget compact, denying eli-
gible students a space at the 
university for the first time in 
more than three decades. If 
the University must make 
changes as a result of its bud-
get SItuation, it should say so 
Instead of hiding the truth 
behind an outdated docu-
ment. 

Members of the UC 
Student Association should 
be applauded for their recent 
deCISion to recommend 
changes that would make the 
Master Plan once again rele-
vant to the state. Now, law-
makers must do the same. 

A new proposal must 
address California's fiscal 
reality and its needs in the 
21st century. Without these 
critical updates, the original 
Master pfan is of no more use 
to Californians than poodle 
skirts and bomb shelters. 

Drug convicts deserve 
access to financial aid 

T he third time may in fact be the charm for Rep. Barney Frank's 
(D-Mass.) attempt to repeal 
the Higher Education Act's 
drug provision, which is 
now in its sixth year of 
practice and, according to 
Its author, a misinterpreta-
tion. 

When Rep. Mark Souder 
(R-Ind.) wrote the, law in 
1998, he didn't expect the 
bill to prevent everyone ever 
convicted of a drug offense 
from receiving financial aid; 
he originally intended for 
the biII to only deny aid to 
students convicted of a drug 
offense while in college, and 
has recently voiced support 
for the bill's reVISIOn. 
However, a new interpreta-
tion of this bill isn't enough; 
Congr-ess should finally Side 
with Frank and abolish the 
old law. 

While it is true that stu-
dents have a res~nsibility to 
focus on their education and 
put taxpayer money to good 

use, both the revised and the 
current interpretation of the 
law are undeserved and 
counterproductive. 

The drug provision 
should be aoolisned com-
pletely to eliminate this 
myopic and discriminatory 
approach to the disburse-
ment of federal financial 
funds; distribution of aid to 
students should be on a 
need-basis only. 

Since the Dill went into 
effect, 150,000 students 
nationwide have been 
deemed ineligible for aid. 
Sadly, these are ofteri the 
students who have the most 
to gain from a college educa-
tion. 

It is ridiculous to question 
who is more deserving of 
financial aid when the lack of 
education and drug use have 
a close correlation. A con-
gressional decision to adopt 
Frank's insight and repeal 
the HEA drug provision is 
the only way to move past 
this damaging attitude.

YOUcsd.com exacerbates 
divisions in campus cOlnmunity 

Genuine dialogue needed between 
people of opposing viewpoints 

.,.IYANTSM 
Opinion Editor 

In America, the land of the 
free, people are encouraged to be 
as tolerant as possible, leading to 
movements supporting py rights, 
minority rights and even animal 
rights, each of which is a worthy 
cause. Most college students -
young and highly educated -
have embraced those idess of clas-
sical liberalism. (This is to be dis-
tinguished from modem liberal-
ism in the Democratic party sense, 
though that certainly al50 applies 
unless you attend B9h Jones 
Uoivenity.) Sadly, many, like the 
ereaton of YOUcsd.com, often 
forget that tolerance means toler-
ating people with different beliefs 
than you - whether they have a 
different perception of what it 
means to be American, married or 

, even what good music is. 
According to the "About" sec-

tion of its Web site, YOUcsd.com 
was created by a "loosely coordi-
nated band of malcontents" in 
order to develop a greater sense of 
conununity through news blog-
ging. The concept is praiseworthy, 
and the bIOI itself certainly lives 
up to its stated purpose of provid-
ing fresh and informative news; it's 
• very easy read and the layout is 

superb. A student could do much 
wane than to read the blog for 
information; in recent posts, it has 
covered many of the same issues as 
this very newspaper. All in all, it's 
an amazing achievernent, especial-
ly for what appean to be a small, 
dedicated group of students. 

Unfortunately, the biOI, for all 
its spunk, fai1s to actually build 
community, because what the cre-
ators have not recognized is that 
there are, in fact, many people on 
campus who are not liberal, do not 
hate the administration and are not 
panicularly interested in the Pixies 
(sacrilege, I mow). And those stu-
dents' opiniOllS should be respect-
ed, too, instead of ridiculed. Far be 
it from me ~ forget their FIl'St 
Amendment rights, but any group 
of students h~ to build a com-
munity probably should not stalk 
peoples' Xangas, post sections of 
said Xanga, then anonymously 
make fun of him for enjoying last 
year's Fall Fest - an event that 
actually serves to bring people 
together, much more than, say, a 
bIog replete with hack jobs and 
posts c!cpding people who don't 
completely ape-with its authon. 

What's really needed OIl this 
campus is some genuine dialogue, 
or, failing that, some courteous 
respect. Any group hoping to 

bridge gaps in the community 
should solicit opposing viewpoints; 
with its new policy of accepting 
submissions, YOUcsd.com may be 
on the right track, if it actually 
publishes entries that disagree with 
the prevailing ideology or the biOI. 

Something that's easy to forget 
in our Bill O'ReiUy/Michael 
Moore political reality is that not 
all Republicans are rich douche 
bags who want to cut lUes and 
6ght wars and that not aU 
Democrats are Hip-flopping poeers 
who want to raise tues.and kill 
business. (And if you thinIc that one 
of the O'ReiUy-Moore pair is a 
genius and the other is a hack, I 
regret to inform you that the only 
difference is that you agree with 
one and not the ocher.) In fact, 
many people are neither 
Republican not Democrat, and are 
actually turned off by the macho 
posturing of both the Bush camp 
and the Bush haters. What's sadly 
ironic, d!ough, is that thole are the 
people that macho posturiol is 
desipd to convince. 

Even more tragic is that many 
probably agree with some of the 
tbinp YOUcsd.com eapooses 
without feelins the same vitriol.

'nil UCSDOUAlDI .... OPINION 5 

Living in Berkeley co-ops 
gives different perspedlve 

Privacy fears over 
wiretapping overblown 

Federal government should 
provide funding to universities indecent 

exposure 
Marianne Madden 

I n my quest to become the most hated penon on the UCSD campus, I spent this 
summer in Berkeley. Yep, my 
home for the summer was that 
crusty hippie- and hobo-infested 
haven for the finest fruits and nuts 
America has to offer. 

Not only that, but I didn't live 
in an apartment, dorm or house 
like a rromu/, sane penon. I lived 
in a co-op. "A commune?" my 
friends would invariably ask, gig-
gling, whenever I informed them 
of this. "No!" I would answer, the 
bile rising in my throat. "A co-op! 
A . 'They' " COOf""tItrVt. re .. . 

Wdl, let me give you the full 
definition. Co-ops are big houses 
where hordes of scrubby college 
students live together 50 when our 
penonal belongings get ripped off 
when we're out, we have 20, 50 or 
even 100 housemates to commis-
erate with. 

We don't have co-ops here at 
UCSD (except the kind that sell 
cheap bagels and interpret "coop-
erate" as "fight to stay on cam-
pus"). Co-op housing is all about 
communal living, so rent stays 
low and people pool their labor 
so the house remains clean, 
standing and stocked with toilet 
paper. Except this was Berkeley, 
and these were college students, 
so the house is never clean, and it 
lacked toilet paper more often 

than not. It came with the territo-
ry, rea1ly. 

The cleanliD"' of my particu-
lar co-op wu so neglected that we 
had an ema tenant in the boa.-
a rat, nicknamed Splinter, who had 
made a cameo appearance during 
a house meeting a few days before 
I moved in. I know what happened 
because the screams of the girls 
who spotted the rat were stiU 
echoing throughout the house 
three days later when I lugged my 
duffel bag up the stain to my 
room, wondering if I was about to 
make the biggest mistake of my 
life. 

My bedroom wasn't even 
worth talking about, 50 in classic 
Indecent Exposure fashion, I'm 
going to dwell on it at length. 

Outside of the hobos roaming 
People's Park, my room was the 
ugliest thing I've seen - ever -
in my whole entire life. Someone 
had literally slapped paint on the 
walls - paint in the shade of 
Technicolor Hospital Blue. I like 
blue, I love blue, blue is in fact my 
favorite color, but this blue made 
me go green in the gills. Inwardly, 
I referred to my room as "the blue 
room," outwardly I'd introduce 
the space to friends from outside 
the.house with, "This is my room. 
No need to tell me it such, I know 
it does." 

You know how on MTV's 
"Cribs," everyone always has to 
introduce the bedroom with the 
wink~wink nudge-nudge boast of 
"This is where aU the magic hap-
pens?" Well, my room was 50 
unerly bereft of magic, it acrually 
made people cry upon seeing it. 
That's just how bad it was. 

With the Technicolor Bruise 

walls imposing so much, though, 
the other oasty features of the 
room were less noticeable. The 
mattress saued even when DO 
weipt was upon it, the room was 
lit (or, more often, Dot lit) by one 
dim fluorescent light that worked 
only on occasion, a tiny recess In 
the wall functioned IS a closet, and 
the one small window framed a 
screen hanging on by a thread of 
masking tape. 

Needless to say, I spent as little 
time there as possible. I kept 
myself busy enough so that when I 
came home to crash in the wee 
hours of the morning, I wouldn't 
notice or at least wouldn't care, 
that I could feel the wood plat-

. form of my bed frame through my 
mattress. 

Of course, after living in a 
commune - er, co-op - all sum-
mer, moving back down here was a 
bit of a shock. I now have only five 
roommates instead of seventeen, 
and instead of having an elusive 
rat crawling around in the 800r-
boards, we have two very friendly, 
very clean cats. We actually do 
dishes and clean the floor more 
than once a month, and I don't 
have to worry about some 
unnamed person stealing all my 
food from the fridge. And, most 
importantly, my room doesn't 
look like shit. 

So, yes, if you're one of those 
people who hates Berkeley on 
principle, you could use myexpe-
rience as an affirmation that all 
the nasty stereotypes about it are 
true. It's stinky, dirty and danger-
ous. The ocean is cold, the hiUs 
are steep and the weed is abun~

Seven )'tin before the events of 
Sept. II and the passage of the 
USA Patriot Act, Congress passed a 
law called the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement 
Act. This act ensured that commu-
nication lines, such as land lines 
and ceU phones, be equipped to be 
capable of surveillance. The 
Federal Communications 
Commission announced in August 
that all phone caUs made over the 
Internet should likewise be subject 
to the CALEA regulations. 

Naturally, the networks at higher 
education institutions across the 
country are now expected to com-
ply. However, the American Council 
on Education has submitted a list of 
complaints concerning the new 
requirements. Perhaps the most 
worrisome and legitimate complaint 
is the high cost of revamlling the 
entire networking systems of hun-
dreds of universities. With many 
campuses strapped for cash, an 
uninvited demand to undertake a 
daunting technical project is not 
heanily welcomed. Considering 
that CALEA was passed in the inter-
est of national security and law 
enforcement, it's hardly presumptu-
ous to request that such broad-based 

~ come packaged with funding 
from the federal government, 
instead of requiring individual uni-
venities to absorb the expense. 

Granted, money does not grow 
on trees in Washington, D.C. 
Nonethdess, the cost and bother it 

will take for the process to be carried 
out is si«nificant, and the dump-it-
and-dear-with-it project that is 
lumped on universities should be 
accompanied by some form .of com-
promise, financial aid or support ser-
vices to carry out the process. 

The A.C.E. and othen have also 
voiced fears that student privacy 
might be violated. This concern is 
not totally unfounded, and as an 
indicator of Americans' stiU-persis-
tent Jeffersonian strain of suspicion 
regarding such meddling from the 
government, should not be totally 
disregarded. 

However, fean of privacy viola-
tion are often exaggerated. It may be 
disconcerting to think about the FBI 
listening in on a student's internet 
voice chats, but what does the Big 
Brother bogeyman actually do? 
Have people been persecuted or 
spied on for chatting with their 
friends about their drunken stupor 
of the night before, or about how 
they shoplifted that bobble head 
from Sav-On? The FBI, CIA and 
other goverrunent agencies, I assure 
you, do not give a flip about you, 
and they are not going to waste their 
time and resources spying on you. 

The FBI makes a good point in 
the necessity of such a system: 
Terrorists are not dimwined, and 

. could easily use internet calling ser-
vices to communicate. In a society 
as large, complex, and yes, private 
as ours, law enforcement should 
have the ability to investigate sus-
pects and gather intelligence - and

FCC: Rule to stifle technology, groups argue 

* 
continued (rom page I 

extend the 1994 law to include 
broadband services. 

Universities would be forced 
to upgrade their facilities out of 
their general budgets, which are 
already so-etched to a breaking 
point, a coalition of educators 
said in opposition to the deci-
sion. 

"The cost of having to upgrade 
networks every time law enforce-
ment needs to wiretap could be 
cost prohibitive," said Garret 
Stern, a policy analyst with 
Educause, a nonprofit association 
dealing with information technol-
ogy for universities and a party of 
the coalition, 

Debates over the ruling have 
occurred as UCSD announced its 
plan to provide Internet phone 
calls on campus. On Sept. 27, 
UCSD join.ed with SIPphone 
Inc., to unveil an aperimental 
connection of UCSD's o-aditional 
phone lines and its Internet ser-
vice. 

The joint effort will allow Stu-
dents and faculty to use a campus 
phone to call any other phone on 
SIPphone's worldwide network, 
free of charge, Assistant Vice 
Chancellor for Administrative 
Computing and 
Telecommunications Elazar Harel 
said in a university statement. In 
its experimental form, the pro-
gram will allow approximately 25 
Internet phone calls to occur 
simultaneously, according to the 
statement. 

Under the FCC ruling, this 
type of manage~ network would be 
subject to law enforcement wire-
taps and would therefore need to 
be updated, according to Julius 
Knapp, the deputy chief of the 
FCC's Office of Engineering and 
Ter.hnology. 

The preliminary decision con-

eluded that broadband service 
providers, including public univer-
sities that offer free Internet ser-
vices, should be required to install 
new monitoring equipment at 
their own COSb. 

The commission tried to allevi-
ate the strain on schools and uni-
versities that offer free Internet 
services by tentatively concluding 
that the burden of financing the 
conversion would not rest on 

" We don't want to create 
spaces where people who 

are up to no good can 
hatJe a safe haven." 

- JuIus ~ ~ chief. 
FCC's 0IIke~_ 

establishments, which merely pro-
vide the Internet service, Instead, it 
would rest on the company that 
sells the service to these establish-
ments. 
- While this clarification 

excludes most universities from 
financial culpability, it fails to do 
so for many California schools. 
The University of California sys-
tem, the California State 
University systems, several private 
universities and many high schools 
receive external Internet access 
from the Corporation for 
Education Network Initiatives in 
California, according to Jim 
Dolgonas, the president of 
CENIC. 

As a nonprofit organization, 
CENIC's expenditure would 
"eventually be reflected in 

[UCSD's) bills," as well as those of 
other universities, Dolgonas said. 

In response to the preliminary 
decision, a group of education 
associations, including A.C.E. and 
the American Association of State 
Colleges and Universities, filed 
comments with the commission 
citing their concerns. 

"We are not aware of any cost 
estimates for creating a national 
surveillance system for our univer-
sities and libraries that provide 
Internet access, but increasing 
prices is not an option," the educa-
tors stated in docwnents filed with 
the FCC. "Unlike common carri-
ers, coalition members provide 
Internet access on an unpriced, 
noncommercial basis." 

The coalition argued that the 
ruling would stifle technological 
development as well as require 
libraries and universities to collect 
more personally identifiable infor-
mation if the records were later 
subpoenaed, Under the gUidelines 
of the ruling, no new technology 
could be introduced into either the 
private or public sector without 
first being engineered to comply 
with the federal standards, 

The commission defended its 
decision, citing the need for sur-
veillance by law enforcement 
agencies in order to promote 
domestic security and fight·crime. 

"We don't want to create spaces 
where people who are up to no 
good can have a safe haven," 
Knapp said. 

However, an agreement that 
strikes a balance between security 
and the concerns of the educators 
can be reached, he said. 

The agency will accept com-
ments through early December 
before the ruling is finalized.

Mishaps force 
Los Alamos 
lab closure 

cantinued from page I 
fied to manage the three labs, In 
June, two storage devices contain-
ing classified information were 
reported missing at Los Alamos. In 
July, the Project on Government 
Oversight - a government watch-
dog group critical of UC manage-
ment - revealed that classified lab 
information had been sent over 
unsecured e-mail systems 17 times 
over the course of several months. 
A laser accident during the summer 
also injured an intern. 

In response to these incidents, 
administrators shut down the Los 
Alamos lab and suspended 23 
employees. The lab is expected to 
reopen soon. 

"The UC has had one manage-
ment failure after ar.other in the 
last several years," said Peter 
Stockton, senior investigator at the 
Project on Government Oversight. 
"Responsibility and accountability 
starts at the top. The people who 
were dismissed [over the summer) 
were lower-level people .. , and we 
weren't exactly too happy with 
that," 

Stockton said he believes that 
combining with a corporate partner 
would be the best step for the uni-
versity, should it choose to bid in 
the competition. 

"Whoever wins the competition 
is fine with us, but I assume [the 
University of California) will com-
bine with a corporate parmer who 
will have better management 
skills, n Stockton said, 

Another government watchdog 
group, the Tri-Valley Communities 
Against a Radioactive 
Environment, has been advocating 
for a more open contracting 
process for the labs. Known as Tri-
Valley CAREs, the group has 
pushed for the past 15 years for the 
conversion of the Los Alamos and 
Livermore labs into civilian sci-
ence-based labs similar to the 
Berkeley lab, which currently per-
forms no classified military 
research. 

"We've been disappointed at the 
reluctaoce of the regents to trans-
forming the Los Alamos laboratory 
and the Livermore laboratory into 
civilian science-based labs," said 
Marylia Kelley, executive director 
of Tri-Valley CAREs. "We think 
the University of California may be 
an appropriate manager of civilian 
science-based labs. There's a lot of 
scientific research that should be 
done in the national interest." 

Tri-Valley CAREs, which is also 
considering making a bid in the 
competition, has argued that .in 
addition to management issues, the 
mission of the labs should also be 
addressed. 

"The question isn't whether we 
need scientists, the question is what 
we should employ those scientists 
for," Kelley said. "We would like to 
question the services of two full-
scale Armageddon laoo." 

However, many UC faculty 
members hope that the regents will 
decide to compete for the bid. 

An Academic Senate survey 
released in June showed that 67 
percent of the UC faculty support a 
university bid on the labs. Many 
faculty members have research 
relationships with the labs, accord-
ing to York. 

The request for the Los Alamos 
bid is tentatively expected in 
January, with the Livermore 
request following later in 2005. No 
concrete timetable has been set for 
the Berkel~ lab. The regents are 
currently taking actions that will 
allow the university to preserve the 
option of bidding, Harrington 
said.

Underground act

so who's filling the number-two . spot at Fall Fest? Who\ that 
"keep-your-eye-on" artist to 

complement main course Jimmy 
Eat World this year? None other 
than hip-hop trio Dilated Peoples, 
who released their third album, 
NtighborhooJ Watch, last spring. 
Dilated Peoples are currently in .. 
that danger zone between under-
ground unknown and mainstream 
megastars. Think Outkast before 
Stlmlumill. 

The band was born in 1992 out 
of the meetings between Evidence 
and Rakaa lriscience in L.A. s 
freestyling underground. Both MCs 
were influenced by the likes of old-
school pioneers such as Run-DMC 
and Public Enemy. The pair grew to 
a threesome when Evidence and

In an attempt to please the most UCSD listeners, A.S. Programming - bless their 
souls - will usually stock Fall Fest 
with a mainstream rock/punic band 
and a moderately famous hip-hop 
number, neither being quite what 
anybody is dying to see, but both 
acceptable enough to check out. 
Then, with the leftover money, 
there's an attempt to enter other 
musical genres with a band wbo is 
big ... in circles of obscurity. 
Which brings us to The Velvet 
Teen: a three-man indie-rock band 
from Santa Rosa that has steadily 
gained renown since 2002. 

The Velvet Teen formed when 
singer/guitarist Judah Nagler and 
drummer Logan Whitehurst, call-
ing themselves "The Secret 
Band," joined up with 
bassist/vocalist John Staples. True 
to the original naming, the band

striking, vocally layered interlude 
that quotes other songs, including 
Tommy James' "Crimson and

unusually moody and bitter song, 
"Get It Faster," that enters the mind 
of an adulterer and is full of scratchy 
guitars and drums that sound like 
threatening, approaching footsteps. 

"The Middle," with its fun video

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

album 

On their self-titled CD, the San Diego-based Louis XIV - which features three previous members of Convoy - focus on a vain boy who spews out lyrics 
like, "me, me, me, me, that is all I really care about," and 
believe that he is the great king. The story unfolds against 
a backdrop of solid, traditional rock 'n' roU, veering occa-
sionally into rebellious, dynamic beats. 

In "God KiUed the Queen," Brian Karscig teasingly 
sings, "If you want to take my body tonightiThen you've 
got to be somebody tonightl Use me just to make your 
body feel right;" Jason HiU asserts that "God killed the 
queen," and in the midst of the noise, a guiw seems to be 
having a fight with itself. The rest of the CD fa11s under 
three distinct styles. One includes tense, bluesy guiws 
(mildly resembling the Strokes) with simultaneously 
cocky and taunting lyrics muttered by Hill. Another con-
tains faster, louder beats and, with IUrscig's forceful and 
lighthearted vocals, demonstrates more punk influence. 
The sentimental ballad "The Ghost of the Chapel 
Royal," sounds like an impersonation of the Rolling 
Stones while pondering the death of a great king. 

Louis XIV will be perfonning on Oct. 2 at the 
Casbah.

The brash, defiant sound of the Libertines l>rings me back to simpler times when musicians "stuck it to the man" (dare I say) and conformist pop did not saturate 
mainstream radio. 

With their second, self-titled album. the Libertines 
take a very similar approach to their critically acclaimed 
debut, Up The BrllCltet. The record opens with their first 
single, "Can 't Stand Me Now," an up-tempo number that 
beautifully captures Pete Doherty's recent fdll into drug 
abuse with the lyrics, "Cornered the boy, kicked out at the 
world! The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now." 

As the a!bum progresses, the Libertines continue their 
fast-paced songs and passionate lyrics. They stop ever so 
gracefully to drop in a few slow numbers, such as the 
endearingly out-of-tune "Don't Be Shy," and the soft-yet-
aggressive groove of "Music Men the Light<; Go Out." 

While hopefully their next effort will take their music 
to another level, I can settle for the passion and youthful 
vigor they have put into both of their records.

reviews 

Buried somewhere about halfway through this record, 
the line, "I've got a 
heavy metal mouth, it 
hurls obscenity" is audi-
ble under a wall of slow-
ly unraveling distorted 
guitars. 

Elliott Smith's 
posthumous record is as 
close to heavy metal as we 
will ever get from him. 
He was somewhere in the 
mixing process at the time 
of his apparent suicide. 
This fact may seem like 
tabloid fodder, but is nec-
essary for proper enjoy-
ment of the record; filled 
with hauntingly beautiful

melodies hidden under borderline-ugly chaotic 
instrumentation, this album truly is the sound of 
suicide. 

Smith is surprisingly adept at singing the blues 
without the presence of a single blues song on this 
record. His voice is tired on Frtml /I BII1tmmt 011 a 
Hill, losing all of the usual bounce that makes his 
melancholic subject matter acceptable on previous 
releases. 

Yet the final track, "A Distorted Reality is Now a 
Necessity to Be Free," is a notable exception, and 
breaks free from the gloom to become quite possi-
bly the best Smith song ever recorded. 

The distorted quagmire that is the rest of the 
album is not too bad either: the lurching "Strung 
Out Again" presents the listener with something 
similar to hearing Jimi Hendrix cover the Heatles' 
"Mile My Guitar Gently Weeps" at half speed; 
"Ostriches & Chirping" uses sampled birdsong to 
create an incredibly upbeat, bouncy tune. 

Smith's final album is indeed a difficult listen, but 
proves essential for fans of this late icon.

'Yes Men' fight hubris with humor 
Political pranksters embarrass establishment in new film 

By IRIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

YOU could say it was all Michael Moore's fault, with his single-handed introduc-tion of the activist-documentary to main-
stream film. Or possibly Johnathan Swift's 
18th-century mockery of leaders by pretend-
ing to speak for those in power. Blit regard-
less of where the blame fall s, two 
activist/artists named Andy Bichilbaum and 
Mike Bonanno still have a lot of explaining to 
do. As the leaders of an international group 
of pranksters calling themselves "The Yes 
Men," Bichilbaum and Bonanno use a nefar-
ious process they call "identity correction" to 
impersonate powerful groups and cause may-
hem at respected business conferences while 
enjoying the free food. The upcoming docu-
mentary film, "The Yes Men", follows 
Bichilbaum, Bonanno and several of their 
"assistants" through the course of one such 
impersonation involving the World Trade 
Organization. 

"Identity correction" is much like identity 
theft, except instead of using a per:son ~ stolen 
identity to obtain money for criminal acts, the 
Yes Men steal the identity of the organizations 
they see as the "real" criminals and take what 
they see as these organizations' "aiminal poli-
cies" to their natural conclusion. 

Taking the wro policy of outsourcing to 
one natural conclusion, Bichilbaum and 
Bonanno proposed a businessmans suit of the 
future which would allow managers to give . 
electric shocks to their workers in India from a 
control panel in the suit, conveniently located 
on the end of a three-foot long inflatable gold 
phallus.

REVIEW 

It's a difficult decision whether to be more 
amused or scared by the fact that the business 
leaders of America play along with these 
appalling pranks. In "the WTO," men and 
women in expensive suits agree politely that, 
yes, slavery was a more efficient system than 
our labor market today. It depends on 
whether the viewer considers "The Yes Men" 
to be more of a comedy or a political movie. 
Another policy "explanation" involves a 
WTO program to send "recycled" hainburg-
ers from McDonald's to those less fortunate 
in Africa and South America. 

As a comedy, it succeeds brilliantly. Words 
cannot describe the laughter that such play-
ful civil disobedience evokes. It's one-part 
"Jackass," two-parts "Office Space." with a 
little bit of Chauncey Gardener from "Being 
There" sprinlded on top. 

Yet as a political movie, "The Yes Men" is 
nothing to scoff at. While recent politico-doc-
umentaries like MOOTe~ various video screeds 
offer only one perspective and narrate to you 
what conclusions to make, "The Yes Men" 
resists being overly preachy and works from a 
surprising variety of perspectives. 

The Gllllrt/itm recently caught up with 
Bichilbaum and Bonanno on one of their 
misinformation tours, and gave them a 
chance to explain themselves: 

GUARDIAN: Why haven't you been fed 
to the bears, or at least arrested' Isn't what 
you do illegal? 

The Yes Men: Perhaps it is! And we don't 
know! Bears would be tOO good for us, but our 
targets don't want the risk. At least thatS our 
theory. Anytime anyone has done something 
about us - saying they "deplore" us, etc. -

Velvet: NorCal band chart 
new course with Elysium 

conUnUl!d from page 9 
revels in being secretive; their 
lyrics are elusive ... their styles are 
ever-changing and even the writ-
ing on their CD is in clear ink 
that can only be read under 
direct light when held at a cer-
tain angle. All this ambiguity, 
however, hovers between being 
amusing and annoying. 

Their original stuff resembled 
emo-punk with the melodic reso-
nance of Cold play and the 
twangy, blown-out guitar of the 
Yeah Yeah Yeahs. They put out 
some catchy songs - even a few 
danceable tunes, like '''Counting 
Backwards. " 

But after touring across the 
United States for two years, 
opening for bands such as 
Cursive and Death Cab for 
Cutie, audiences complained 
that their material was growing 
stale. 

In response, The Velvet Teen 
spent six months recording 
songs onto their laptop in a 
recording studio/shed in the 
Sonoma, Calif. countryside. 

The result is Album F1ysium, 
released in Au~. The big shift 
in style is controversial: guitars 
and lyrical clarity are gone. 
Instead, synthetic arrangements 

of violins, horns and piano infil-
trate every song - some odd, 
some bizarre, some sounding like 
an old dial-up modem. 

The lyrics still possess the same 
sad-but-witty morsels of insight ... 
if only we could understand them. 
Nagler's voice, noticeably deeper, 
weaves in and out of songs with 
scattered trains of thought, failing 
to leave a strong impression on the 
listener's ear. 

Nagler claims that the subtle 
ambiguous effect is intentional, 
and the outcome is successful; 
songs envelop the listener with 
the highly popular emo themes of 
anxiety and broken relationships, 
leaving one's mind to wander its 
own thoughts. 

The main point is that Elysium 
features very different, slower 
stuff from their old, catchier tunes 
- and UCSD students will be 
some of the first to get a glimpse 
of it when the band comes to Fall 
Fest. 

Are the lyrics witty enough to 
sift through? Most likely. 

Does the new synthetic style 
deserve a listen? Probably. 

Will the drunken Fall Fest 
audience appreciate the new sub· 
t1ety of The Velvet Teen? 
Probably not. 

Yes Men: Misfits help 
Bush campaign - sort of 

concinUl!d from page 13 
they've looked ridiculous to the 
press. On the other hand, what we 
do might not be illegal. Lawyers 
don't seem to know; the ones we've 
asked can't point to such-and-such 
a law that means we're in trouble. 

G: Do you think that what you 
are doing is rnalcing a differern;e? 

YM: We guesstimate that it is, 
somehow, somewhere. And we're 
having a lot of fun with it anyhow, 
so even if not, it's nOl like we're 
bigger fools than we obviously 
are. And either way, it's bener 
than sining on our asses waiting 
for the world to change on its 
own. 

G: After all of these silly stunts 
with the wro, what do you have 
planned next? . 

YM: Right now, we're out on 
the road with our Bush cam-
paign. It's called the "Yes Bush 
Can!" campaign, and we're out 
there trying to correct the iden· 

tity of George [W] Bush more 
honestly than Bush can speak 
himself. Like, where he said he 
has a healthy forest initiative, we 
go out and explain what the 
"healthy forest initiative" really 
is - people cutting down as 
many trees as possible. Or the 
"clear skies" initiative, which 
allows more poll utants into the 
atmosphere. 1 mean, these 
ironies are already there, so all 
we do is assume the voice of 
Bush's campaign and explain 
what the goals of these policies 
really are. 

G: With the success of Michael ' 
Moore and "The Daily Show," it 
looks like a mockery-type cam-
paign is getting through to people. 
Why do you think that is? 

YM: It's because the media 
isn't doing their job. There's so 
much that desperately needs to 
he explored now, and all of these 
new documentaries are about

Dilated: 
Rap trio goes 
beyond the 

'bling' 
coruinued from page 9 

DJ group Beat Junlcies. Together, 
they recorded two singles with ABB 
records. The second of the two, 
"Work the Angles," brought them 
enough club play to sign with 
Capitol. The trio released The 
Pliltform in 2000, hut got more 
attention with the single "Worst 
Comes To Worst," off their sopho-
more effon, The Exptmsitm Ttilm. If 
you know one Dilated Peoples song, 
it's most likely that accessible jam. 

Dilated Peoples rhyme over 
straightforward, turntable-drlven 
beats. They don't really inspire one 
to get freaky on the dance Boor, but 
they do inspire plenty of rhydunic 
nodding. The presence of OJ Babu's 
more-than-competent scratch cou-
pled with their beat selection has 
always been reminiscent of old 
school. Something else that refresh-
ingly separates them from the nonn 
is rap content. Dilated Peoples usu-
ally stays away from the five main-
stream pop-hop Bs - beverages, 
Bentleys, Benjamins, bling and 
bitches. Instead, they rap about a 
myriad of different things from 
George W. Bush to hip-hop sellouts. 
1113nkfu11y, they don't sound like 
sel f-righteous crusaders out to 
change the world - they just tell it 
like it is. 

Dilated Peoples have evolved a 
bit since their fonnation. They start-
ed off as pure LA-flavor under-
ground, palatable only to those 
accustomed to the purest of hip-hop 
sounds. But after hearing "This 
Way," featuring Kanye West, on the 
radio, one can notice that Dilated 
Peoples are slowly starting to sound 
more like a studio production than 
spontaneous an. "This Way" sounds 
like a Kanye West song featuring 
Dilated Peoples. It's a little less obvi-
ous on the other tracks off 
Neighborhood I*tch, but the shift is 
there. "Reach Us" and "World On 
Wheels" are returns to that old-
school style, but songs like 
"Neighborhood Watch," with its 
gunshot and siren sounds, and 
"Caffeine," with its harder beats and 
piano work, sound more like 
smoothly engineered gangster rap. 

When Dilated Peoples hit the 
stage for Fall Fest, expect a laid-
back style from Evidence and more 
verbal acrobatics from Iriscience. 

But what this fan would like to 
hear is some freestyling - even if it 
is about studying and surfing in San 
Diego.

THURSDAY, SEI"TtMBER 30, 2004 

Dunsmore: 
Hitter's 

consistency 
is the key 

conlimM!d from page ;10 
to get bigger than me so I just 
veered off into volleyball and it 
was a perfect fit," the 5-foot-11-
inch Dunsmore said. 

A psychology major at Earl 
Warren College, Dunsmore was 
born 21 years ago in Camp 
Pendleton, Calif. Her father served 
in the military for 27 years and 
unlike most servicemen, was able to 
remain stationed in Pendleton, 
which allowed his daughter to play 
club and high school volleyball. 

Dunsmore earned herself AlJ-
League and AII-Counry selections 
during her stay at nearby Vista High 
School. To round off her accolades; 
she also snatched a Stm Diego UniI11l-
TribrmL All-Academic honor, making 
her a perfect fit for UCSD . 

"Academically, the school's 
great, the people are great, [and] 
I've met so many friends," 
Dunsmore said. "The volleyball is 
so great too, it's gotten better each 
year; we reached the Final Four 
my freshman year so hopefully it 
comes full circle this year so we 
can get back there." 

As of Sept. 28, Dunsmore is 
currently second on the Triton 
all-time list in digs with 1,050; 
second in total attacks with 2,916; 
and third in kills with 1,021. Now 
that she has placed herself in the 
record books, Dunsmore, along 
with her teammates, have their 
eyes set on the ultimate prize - a 
coveted NCAA Division II 
national title. 

"It's always been at the back of 
our minds," she said. "We like to 
take it one game at a time; but 
we're hoping that's where we end 
up." 

CouIteIy UCSD AIhIeIia 
SerIaIIdIIer: Stacy Dunsmore has 
proved herself a team leader. 

Golf: 
Duckworth 

places second 
of 60 golfers 

continued frrym page 20 
up in a tie for 49th place with a 
235. Kramer had some difficulty 
in the tournament's opening 
rounds, as he turned in scores of 
82 and 80, but he returned on 
Sept. 28 to shoot a 73. 

The Tritons return to the 
(course on Oct. 11 and Oct. 12 at 
the Chico State Invitational at the 
Butte Creek Country Club in 
Chico, Calif. Last year, UCSD 
finished the tournament in fifth 
place as Duckworth led the 
Tritons with a ninth place finish. 

nruRSDAY, SEPm.fBER 30, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Water polo: Players expect to beat Davis 
continued frrym page 20 

sealing the match. 
Wins at the Slugfest pushed 

the Tritons' record to an impres-
sive 13-4 as the team prepares to 
do battle with UC Davis on Sept. 
30 in Davis, Calif. In one of the 
first games of the season on Sept. 
4 at the UCSD Triton 
Invitational, UCSD disposed of 
the Aggies in an 11-8 showing. 
Since then, Davis has mustered an 
8-S record. 

"We'll beat [Davis). No prob-
lem," Eichholz said. "It was close 
last time because it was practically 
the first game we played this year." 

The Tritons have a unique 
advantage this season in terms of 
their practices. While other teams 
are forced to divide their best play-
ers from one another to scrimmage 
in practice, or are forced to com-
pete against players who have 
played fewer minutes, UCSD has a 
full, varsity-caliber red shirt team 
in the water at practice every day of 
the week. 

"We're getting a lot of experi-
ence from our red shin group," 
Woodring said. "We're really for-
tunate to have those guys to play 
against." 

but many feel as though the guard 
has change~. 

"I expect BYU-Hawaii to be a 
contender this year," Woodring 
said. "The last couple of years, 
LMU has heen solid, but that's 
starting to c:han«e. " 

The Tritons have a long way to 
go before they start to wony about 
the WWPA Championships, 
though. First, UCSD will be given 
the opportunity to beat No. 6 
Pepperdine in order to step up in 
the rankings. By the numbers, this 
should be a formidable task, as the 
Waves fell to LMU Sept. 25 by a 

12 -9 margin. 
"We're definitely going to beat 

Pepperdine," Eichholz said. "The 
last time we played them we were 
missing shots and making funda-
mental mistakes. That won't hap-
pen again." 

As if l\ guaranteed win over 
Pepperdine weren't enough, the 
Tritons' scoring leader went on to 
claim the 2004 WWPA title. 

"We'll win conference," 
Eichholz said. "BYU-Hawaii will 
be the closest competition, but 
we're going to [the NCAA tourna-
ment)." 

Nonethele$S, building a NCAA 
Final Four-worthy squad is no 
small task . For the Tritom, it 
means maintaining their strength 
through the grueling, final weeks 
of the season in which UCSD faces 
all of its conference opposition 
before going into the Western 
Water Polo Association tourna-
ment. The winner of this champi-
onship wiD advance to the Final 
Four to face off against the best

Preseason 
strength 

lands golf in 
third place 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hot off a fifth-place finish at 
the UCLA Gold Rush tourna-
ment earlier this month, the 
UCSD golf team took third in a 
field of ·11 teams at the Western 
Washington University 
Invitational on Sept. 27 and Sept. 
28, held at the Bellingham Golf 
and Country Club in Bellingham, 
Wash. 

As a team, the Tritons encoun-
tered slight difficulty in the open-
ing round on Sept. 27, turning in 
a score of 294, 6 over par, which 
early on put them in fifth place. 

UCSD came back for the after-
noon round and shot a 290, 2 over 
par, and shaved a whole 10 strokes 
off the team total on Sept. 28 with 
an 8-under-par score of 280, 
putting the team in a tie for the 
lowest round in the tournament. 
The Tritons finished the tourna-
ment in third place with a final of 
864, even par, and two strokes 
lower than their score at the 
UCLA Gold Rush tournament. 

First place tournament honors 
fell to University of Hawaii-Hilo, 
whose round scores of 289, 281 
and 280 netted a total of 850, 14 
shots under par. Tournament host 
Western Washington University 
took second place, turning in 
scores of 282, 293 and 280 to 
complete the tournament five 
shots back at 855. 

UCSD bested fellow 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rivals Cal State 
Stanislaus, which came in sixth, 
and Grand Canyon University, 
which took eighth. Most impres-
sively, however, the Tritons top-
pled Cal State Chico, last year's 
second place team in the CCAA, 
by a 20-stroke margin. 

UCSD was once again led by 
senior star Brian Duckworth, who 
was coming off a 12th place finish 
at the UCLA Gold Rush. 
Duckworth started off hot on 
Sept. 27 with a score of 69 on the 
par-72 course, cooling off a bit in 
the afternoon to shoot an even 72. 
On Sept. 28, he turned in a 68, 
tying for the lowest UCSD round 
score, and giving himself a total of 
209, 7 under par, and a second 
place finish overall in a field of 60 
golfers. 

Sophomore Ryo Yamada was 
the second Triton to finish, tying 
fOI seventh place with a 212 . 
Yamada shot rounds of 74 and 70 
on Sept. 27, and finished the tour-
nament with a 68 on Sept. 28, 
tying Duckworth for the lowest 
UCSD round. 

Fellow sophomore Luke 
Leveillee earned third place hon-
ors for UCSD, and tied for 26th 
overall, finishing with a score of 
221. Leveillee shot 76 and 74 on 
Sept. 27, and came back with a 71 
the next day. 

Senior Joe Dolby earned the 
fourth spot for the Tritons, with 
his "'29, which landed him in a tie 
for 41st place. Dolby had solid 
rounds on Sept. 27, shooting a 75 
and 74, but ran into trouble on 
the second day of the competi-
tion, shooting a frustrating 8-
over-par 80. 

Senior Robbie Kramer filled 
out the squad for UCSD, ending

Dunsmore hits milestone 1,000 digs, kills 
Perfonnance elevates volleyball star into Triton volleyball history 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

She would be the perfect 
poker player - focused and 
intense, with a game face that 
would rival that of Pedro 
Martinez of the Boston Red Sox. 
She's quick on her feet with 
impeccable timing comparable to 
Atlanta Falcons quarterba<;k 
Michael Vick. Combine these tal-
ents and put 
them into the 
body of 
UCSD vol-
leyball senior 
outside hitter 
S t a c y 
Dunsmore. 

In a Sept. 
17 match 
against Grand 
Canyon at 
RIM A C 
Arena, the 
cool-headed 
Dunsmore 
became the 
first-ever 
Triton to record 
1,000 digs.

Senior outside 
hitter, UCSD 

volleyball 
1,000 kills and 

"She's so calm and collected," 
UCSD volleyball head coach 
Duncan McFarland said. "It's 
almost deceptive to watch her. 
She doesn't look that intense; 
she's very even and focused when 
she plays, and I think that's kind 
of the secret to her consistency." 

Not only has her coach 
noticed her calm demeanor, but 
her teammates as well. 

"She's really consistent emo-
tionally," senior outside hitter 
Bonnie Wilson said. "Volleyball 
is really an up-and-down sport 
and if momentum really matters, 
she's very consistent [and] main-
tains her confidence and compo-
sure all the time." 

A consummate team player, 
Dunsmore has been mostly pre-
occupied with contributing to the 
team and hardly glances at her 
individual achievements. 

"It was exciting," Dunsmore 
said of her milestone. "I actually 
wasn't keeping track or anything 
so it was kind of a surprise for 
me." 

Anyone observing her on the 
court and following her stats on 
paper can easily surmise that 
Dunsmore possesses the perfect 
hand on the drawing table - she 
can attack, pass, block, serve and 
dig. 

"She's a very consistent player 
for us," McFarland said. "During 
her time here, she's been the most 
all-around player that we've ever 
had. Her attacking skills are good, 
her passing skills are great, serv-
ing skills ... she really doesn't 
have a weakness in any place of 
the game." 

Perhaps, Ont! can attribute her 
abilities to genetics. Her father, 
Bill Dunsmore, introduced vol-
leyball to her when he played for 
the all-military team. 
Considering her childhood, her 
1,000 kills and 1,000 digs are 
quite a feat. 

Dunsmore dribbled a soccer 
ball around for nine years before 
trading her cleats in for sneak-
ers. Her middle school, 
Roosevelt Middle School in 
Oceanside, Calif., started a vol-
leyball team, and the then-
eighth grader - curious to try a 
sport her father always played -
tried out. She figured that spik-
ing a ball would suit her tall and 
slim frame. 

"I had played soccer for so 
long, and it was more of a con-
tact sport; the girls were starting

After 5-0 tourney, Tritons are confident about WWPA 
Men's water polo outscores opponents 80-24 at UC Santa Cruz Slugfest 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

How must it feel to be the No. 
7 -ranked collegiate water polo 
team in the country, have better 
than a .750 winning percentage, 
and to have just swept through a 
five-game tournament undefeat-
ed, outscoring the opposition 80-
24? Ask the Triton men's water 
polo team about the 2004 UC 
Santa Cruz Slugfest on Sept. 25 
and Sept. 26, where UCSD 
wouldn't let the competition even 

come close, taking wins over 
Claremont, La Verne, host UC 
Santa Cruz, Cal Lutheran and 
Santa Clara. 

"We go into any game that we 
play making sure that we respect 
our opposition," said sophomore 
utility player Joe Woodring. "We 
know that the kinds-of teams that 
we played at the Slugfest come out 
to play their best against us 
because they have nothing to lose 
and everything to gain." 

To open the tournament Sept. 
25, the Tritons netted 37 goals in

two games, toppling the 
Claremont Stags by a 15-8 margin 
and later thrashing La Verne's 
Leopards in a 22-3 blowout. 

"The teams we played this 
weekend were not quite the com-
petition that we were looking for," 
junior driver Chris Eichholz said. 

Eichholz led the UCSD scor-
ing effort against the Stags with 
four goals. His perfonnance was 
complemented by freshman driver 
AdnanJerkovic's hat trick 

In the second match of Sept. 
25, the Triton's dominance sur-
faced almost before the first whis-
tle of the game. In 28 minutes of 
play, UCSD had little trouble 
racking up 22 goals while restrict-
ing the Leopards to only three. 
Eichholz headed the charge for 
the Tritons as he put away four 
goals, followed closely by junior 
two-meter man Chris Finegold 
and freshman driver Curtis 
Williamson, who each posted 
three scores. 

Returning to the pool Sept. 26, 
UCSD maintained its poise as the 
team took on tournament host UC 
Santa Cruz in the day's first game. 
Thanks to three-goal games by 
Eichholz and junior two-meter 
man Matthew Budnick, the 
Tritons were able to follow up an 
8-2 halftime advantage with a 14-4 
victory. 

In the second match of the 

day, UCSD handily shut down 
Cal Lutheran in an 18-5 contest. 
Williamson ~tepped up as the 
leading scorer for the Tritons, 
putting four goals away. 
Freshmen Nathan Weiner and 
Sid Menon converted three goals 
each, demonstrating the new tal-
ent on the UCSD bench. Goalie 
Colin McElroy pulled down 
seven saves in the cage for the 
Tritons. 

Before the long tournament's 
final match against Santa Clara, 
Broncos claimed the win prema-
turely, according to Eichholz; but 
before the game was through, 
UCSD had Santa Clara choking 
on its words with a staggering 11-
4 conquest. ' 

Clinging to a narrow 4-3 lead 
after the first quarter, the Tritons 
blew the game open with a 5-0 
second quarter that left the 
Broncos devastated. 

Fewer Tritons scored in the 
Santa Clara match than any other 
throughout the tournament, but 
clearly there was no trouble post-
ing the numbers for the sixth con-
secutive UCSD win. Leading the 
charge, sophomore utility player 
Jesse Castellini couldn't be con-
tained and rallied for four goals. 
Eichholz, Finegold and Jerkovic 
were dependable for a pair each,
