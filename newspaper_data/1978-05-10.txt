Election fraud 
charge raised 

by Laura A. Richter 
News Editor 

In a letter last week to Vice-
chancellor of Student Affairs 
Howard Hunt , Progressiv e 
Coalition member Jon Bekken 
charged that the AS Elections 
Committee failed to respond to 
co mplaints concerning the 
recent elections within the 48-
hour limit set forth by the 
Electio ns Codes, an d that 
because violations of the codes 
by ca nd idates and by the 
com mittee p.revented . ' due 
process" in the elections, the 
elect ion results should be 
overturned . 

Bekken charged the commit-
tee with failure to enforce 
campaign pend ing limit , 
ca mpaign arid posting regula-
tions, failure to include in the 
code provisions to prevent 
double voting, failure to 
produce a sam pl e ballot , 
failure to post warnings and 
cita tion , and additionally 
charged the Elections ommi-

ioner Lori Dority with 
.eglecting to provide interpre-

tations and clarifications of th 
codes. 

The alleged violations 
" deprived all UCSD students of 
a fair and equitable election ," 
stated the letter. Bekken has 
threatened to take legal action 
if the results are not invali-
dated. 

Absence of evidence 
Hunt responded by comment-

ing that the letter was " well 
written" but that he could not 
take action in the absence of 
" definitive evidence" to 
substantiate the claims. 

" The AS committees a re 
ca pable of assuming the 
res ponsibility ," said Hunt , 
a ding that appeals may be 
made either to himself or to 
Cha nce llor McElroy . " The 
Cha nce llor wouLd hear out 
anybody," Hunt stated, but he 
said that the UC Regents have 
the final authority in this case. 

Dority stated that Bekken 
was sim ply not aware of 
committee procedures when he 
wrote the letter, and that "if we 
ca nnot find substantial 
evidp.nce, the case is complet-
ely dropped" after considera-
tion within 48 hours . 

" It isn't as if he is an ignorant 
person ," added Dori ty . She 
ca lled Bekken ' s complaints 
"serious " but felt that the 
committee tried "very, very 
hard " to uncover evidence , 
es pe cia lly in the case of 
campaign posters being torn 
down or removed from walls . 

" We have no definitive 
answers as to who could have 
done it ," stated Dority . 

According to Dority , she and 
Bekken are scheduled to meet 
a fter the runoff elections at 
which time he will review 
Dority 's letter respon e to the 
charg and " we will continue 
to go over th procedure if he

News Editor 
" A slaughterhouse on ice. " 
Murder mysteries deal in fiction , but this is 

not the title of a new hackneyed bestseller. 
It is what Congressman Leo Ryan (D-

Calif.) called what he witnessed on an April 
trifr to Canada with Congressman Jeff 
Je fords of Vermont: the very real , and very 
gory, clubbing and skinning alive of baby 
harp seals. 

Ryan and Jeffords were rec ruited by 
Greenpeace , a self-acclaimed .. action" 
group which organizes campaigns to block 
the killing of whales and seals, in an effort to 
gain government support for their efforts. 

Born in 1969 out of the Vancouver, B.C, 
Don ' t Make A Wave Committee, which 
organized to protest nuclear testing in the 
South Pacific, Greenpeace has chartered 
10 sea-going boats over the years with which 
the group periodically sets out to deter 
Russians from taking wha1es by placing 
themselves between the harpoons and the 
whales. The Japanese have thus far not been 
confronted. 

Canada to protect a harp seal, which 
"scream as their brains are being bashed." 
Moore reportedly covered the seal with his 
own body. 

" It has to be one of the most disgraceful and 
disgusting ways of making a living," said 
Taunt. Harp seals pelts numbered 48,000 this 
year, compared to 97,000 of most years. Taunt 
said that "Mother Nature was having her 
way", and the ice conditions were thick his 
winter. A quota of 180,000 is allotted " overall" 
for the ships." 

Taunt said that the Canadian government 
was determined to stop the two Congressmen 
from witne sing the "hunt", which he felt is a 
complete misnomer and calls it II an out and 
out slaughter." 

Ryan, who is not only Chairman of the 
House Subcommittee on the Environment but 
member of the House International Relations 
Committee, addressed a letter to Canadian 
Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 
which he stated that he has never been more 
rudely treated by government officials and 
that the Greenpeace party was approached 
with consistent contempt throughout their 
stay in Canada.

were placed in a runoff with 
their nearest competitor. 

In addition to the presidential 
and vice-presidential runoffs,

FOR ~S PRES. AND VP 
Jenkel/Carberry or Moser/Silva? 

Editor: 
Thia Thursday it Election Day. John Jenkel and Ann 

Carberry are amon, those running, and we feel they 
are the mOlt deservin, of your support. We have 
worked closely with theR people, and have witnessed 
their dedication and concern for the well-beine of all 
students at UCSD_1f you have the opportunity to meet 
either John or Ann, you will have no doubt that these 
are the candidates to support. 

When John acceDted the Cbair of the Student Center 
Board, the Board was in dismal shape. Throueh hard 
work and leadership abOity, he ,ot the Board movin" 
and workine for student interests. John has tried to 
make the Student Center more than just an office 
buildin,. He has pushed for a pub, that unlike some 
pro~ls, wouldD't close off the Student Center to the 
majority of students, those under 21. He has begun 
neillotiations with the CamDUS Box Office to bring a 
ticket a,ency like Ticketron or Metro to UCSD. He lias 
also shown himself to be a good manager, playing a 
considerable part in the writing of the budget for the 
Student Center, a budget in excess of $350,000. 

Of all the students at UCSD, none have the 
knowledge of the university, or of how to make the 
Administration work for the students, that is 
possessed by Ann Carberry . Two years as the Muir 
College Rep to Reg Fee, and one year as the Reg Fee 
Intern Coordinator have prepared Ann to meet any I 
challenge in student government. ,Although Ann is 
more adept at numbers than anyone we know. Ann is 
not a pencil pusher. She served on the Day Care 
Options Committee and has been involved with 
numerous other committees serving to enrich the 
quality of life and education at UCSD . 

Together, John and Ann will bring leadership, 
knowledge and cre.ativity to the AS . Through them, 
student government at UCSD will not be a closed 
entity, but an open vehicle for students to improve 
their university both socially and academically. John 
Jenkel and Ann Carberry can make ASUCSD a 
powerful and respected advocate for us all.

What makes Gary Moser, Bill Silva and Marlene 

Peterson differel;lt from their opponents? Why should 
we vote for this slate? The response to these questions 
differentiates and exemplifies the platform of Gary 
Moser, Bill Silva and Marlene Peterson. 

Moser and Silva want to build a government with the 
student resources available. With the multitude of 
college governments, program boards and various 
committees, we know that a powerful student voice 
can exist but only if the AS government can work as a 
catalyst to coordinate these valuable resources . This 
is where old governments have failed and the 
administration has ruled . Students have fought 
against students with no cohesive student government 
to represent the entire student community to the 
Administration. 

Gary Moser, Bill Silva and Marlene Peterson have 
built a structure of teamwork. 

This is why Moser and Silva have been successful in 
pushing student programs through the administrative 
bureaucracy, e.g .. a unanimous Reg Fee vote to save 
Muir' s Activities Coordinator; a student protest 
against parking; a four band Dayon the Green . Seeing 
the need for a team approach, many students who 
have seen the internal AS fighting are openly 
supporting the Moser/Silva slate. 

In Monday's Triton Times, Kevin Eckery, our 
opponent' s campaign manager, explained how he 
wanted to raise students' activities fees to hire more 
administrative support for the AS . This is a true 
bureaucratic response which exemplifies this year's 
waste in the AS. We instead want to cut this year's 
blatant waste in the AS budget. Students pay enough 
money to this university! With an estimated $10,000 
carry-over in unused Activity Fee money this year. we 
will set up an Academic Review Unit. This student run 
organization will shadow the Academic Senate and 
will be charged with ('valuating, c riticizing and 
recommending changes :.0 existing departments and 
programs. Through the <\aactemic Review Unit, we 
would like to establish a credibility in which we may 
reach out long-range g( ';)1. a student voting in the 
tenure process . ' 

We. Gary Moser, Bill :;qva nd Marlene Peter on 
believe in teamwork where A TION makes THE 
differen ce! Take a loo k at OUI uIJl>oncnts ' 
accomplishments . Tak a look at our accomplish-
ments, then vote. 

GARY MOSER 
BILL SILVA 

MARLENE PETERSON 

Editor: -
During the past few weeks most of us have , at one 

time or another, been confronted by one or more 
candidates I'IJnning for a position in the AS. With 
runoff elections taking place this Thursday , we 
most likely will be confronted again . However, it is 
nearly impossible for anyone of us to reach a logical 
decision as to whom to vote for based on these one or 
two minute encounters . It is too easy for a candidate to 
brag of his or her accomplishments. experience and 
concern for fellow students when there is no one 
around to contradict them . 

For this reason, Gary Moser and Bill Silva have 
challenged their opponents to an open public debate . 
Although their opponents keep harping that 
" experience makes a difference", Gary Moser and 
Bill Silva believe that " ACTION makes THE 
difference." While their opponents keep talking about 
what they are loinl to do, Gary Moser and Bill Silva go 
out and do it. 

When plans were made to increase parking fees , 
Moser and Silva worked together and put an end to 
them. To improve the social atmosphere at UCSD 
Silva helped organize the four-band , "Day on the 
Green" , while Moser chaired the Alcohol Policy Task 
Force which put on the" AS Beer Bash" and submitted 
the Pub Proposal. When the Muir ,4.ctivities 
Coordinator position was threatened, Moser and Silva 
lobbied the Reg Fee Committee and saved it. 

Gary Moser and Bill Silva have an unique ability to 
bring people together into well-functioning teams. 
Teamwork is what gets the job done. Instead of trying 
to do everything themselves so they alone receive all 
the glory, Moser and Silva act as catafysts while 
delegating responsibilities to diligent co-workers. The 
more students involved in the process . the more that 
can be done for the students . 

Don 't gamble on promises made by opponents. Look 
at what Moser and Silva have already accomplished 
and what they are going to do next . 

They will create a Central Program Board to abolish 
red tape and conflicts. making it easier for students to 
put their own ideas into action. 

The motion to maintain funding of day care facilities 
has been turned down by the Reg Fee Committee. 
Moser and Silva won' t stop there. They see the vital 
need for adequate day care facilities and will work to 
retain the center in its current form of operation. Day 
care expansion must be researched to meet the needs 
of single parents. 

Moser and Silva will work to obtain free 
gynecological services . 

They will see the need for strong External Affairs 
and Student Welfare Offices . They will fight 
irresponsible community development as well as 
oppose fee and rent increases and housing 
discrimination against students . 

We are excited to see a team such as Moser andSilva 
running for office and wholeheartedly support them . 
A£ter working with them, there is no doubt in our 
minds that they are THE BEST CHOICES. We urge 
you to get out and vote GARY MOSER for 
PRESIDENT and BILL SIVLA for VICE -

Friedman for communications 
Editor: 

This Thursday's election represents the final opportunity for students to 
elect responsible leadership to the AS. The voting has gone well so far. 
incredibly well. Last week '!> elections recorded one of the highest turnouts 
in the history of student body elections in California . 

It is my hope that students will continue to vote according to the issues . 
and not fall under the influence of irrelevant mudslinging: With this in 
mind. I am writing to point out several facts which are important in the 
race for Commissioner of Communications. I am in the runoff for this 
office. 

First . I strongly believe that I a m the best qualified candidate for this 
post. It is important that anyone with a responsibility to the media have 
experience working with it. I have been a writer. photographer and 
contributor to many publications. both on and off campus. I have worked 
with both types oJ newspapers found at UCSD. those that depend on student 
body funds and those that survive solely on advertising revenue. 

r understand the problem of keeping the editorial content of a ll ca mpus 
papers free of interference from the student government. The press and 
the government must be completely independent of each other. Even those 
newspapers which depend upon AS allocations should be able to critize the 
AS without fear that their funding will be cut ofr. An efficient go\'e rnment 
thrives off cri ti cal analyses of its actions . 

Second, my opponent has made a proposal which. if carried out, would 
spell disaster for print media at UCSD. He has called for ' 'consolidating the 
facilities and functions of several of the existing campus publications" 
(TT. April 26) . This would reduce the number of papers and the di versity of 
viewpoints expressed by each . More importantly, the total number of 
students involved in the production of newspapers would most certainly 
fall greatly. Anyway , what would we call such a " full service newspaper?" 
(TT, April 26) . The Free Voz Chaim Bulletin-Indicator. perhaps? 

I am in complete opposition to this plan. I propose that the number of 
newspapers produced by students be increased . More students should be 
involved in campus journalism. This is why. for example, I will work to 
establish a humor magazine. There are many viewpoints which do n~ yH 
have an outlet in the media. A single full service newspaper would be a no 
service newspaper . 

I hope all students will consider these facts bP.fore voting this Thursday. 
BILL FRIEDMAN 

Former VP candidate 
endorse Bill Silva 
Fellow Students: 

As former vice-presidential candidates we would like to thank our 
supporters for their votes. and hope you will continue your concern for 
putting qualified people in office. We feel that you can best do this by taking 
the time to make a n informed decision and voting for Bill Silva in the runoff 
election on Thursday. 

We recognize that Ann Carberry is an experienced and qualified 
politician, yet we feel that Bill will make a superior vice-president. Bill's 
experience is more t!lan adequate for this position !Reg Fee Intern to 
Student Financial Services and a Muir House Advisor among other 
thinls). However, what sets him apart from tile other candidate is his 
ability to recognize and utilize the invaluable resources available in 
students here. 

Bill is an initiator and a catalyst. He possesses all the dynamics 
necessary to make the AS a cohesive, functioning unit that will bring about 
tangible changes for the benefit of all students. 

Bill is our choice for vice-president, and we urge our supporters and all 
concerned students to cast their vote for Bill Silva.

Democratic principles shift 

by T.D. Allman 
Pacific News Service 

NEW YORK - The union leader 
was angry . The proposal - to give 
tax breaks to families who send 
their children to private schools -
would cause 100,000 students to 
abandon New York City's schools, 
asserted Patrick Burke of the 
United Federation of Teachers at a 
well-attended press conference. It 
would cost 6,000 teachers their jobs. 
It betrayed Iibral principles . The 
Senator behind the propos .. l. the 
union leader argued, would des troy 
the nation 's largest public school 
system if he had hi s way. 

The target of Burkes ire was 
Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan - him If a product of 

ew York City 's public schools . 
who won New York's last enatorial 
election with strong union support. 
Later in the day. another Democra t 
- Manha ttan co ngressional 
candidate Ca rter Burden - joined 
the dispute. condemning Moyni -
han 's tuiti{)n tax credit proposal as 
"a retrogressive socia l policy and 
constitutionally unsound." Burden , 
unlike Moynihan . is the son of a 
millionaire. and the product of the 
East Coast's elite private school. 

T.D .. Allman is an associa te <editor 
of PNS and contributing editor of 
Hal'per's magazine. His writings 
have appeared in the New Yorl{ 
Times, Washington Post and 
numerous other periodicals. 

Su.c h disputes are becoming 
increasingly common inside the 
Democratic Party this year. It is in 
part because the Democrats , 
tha nks to their heavy congressional 
majorities . now represent areas -
s uburban and sometimes even 
rural - tha t once were Republican 
preserves . 

Letter 
Difference 
in method 
Editor: 

In reference to Mr. Starrs' letter 
last April 21st: it is not the 'mellow 
radical' label which I object to . but 
rather . the negative judgment 
being made, and the implication 
that Will Wright a nd other 
professors like him , are no more 
than hypocrites . 

I think Mr. Starrs' judgment does 
rest on his thinking that he knows 
what a 'good radical' is and hould 
be . His definition seems limited to 
the canvassing/door-knocking type 
of activist. These people deal with 
specific issues (votes , petitions. 
letter writing), usually on a one-to-
one basis (as in going door to door) . 
These people are necessary for 
social change. I know that- what I 
do not understand is: why. if this 
'good radical' and a professor . or 
write r. a re in agreement on basic 
val ues and desire for change- why 
condemn the professor or writer on 
the basis of thei r difference in. 
method ?? 

Profl!ssors and writers just try to 
' c ha nge peoples ' minds ' on a 
different level . by different means. 
I wonder why Mr. ta rrs does not 
appreciate this academic attempt 

(Please turn to page 10) 
. 

The result is a situation viewed 
with growing distress by those who 
want the Democrats to remain the 
party of social liberalism . Simply 
put , in many states. Democrats 
often no longer need the poor, the 
racial minorities. the inner cities-
the traditional New Deal and Great 
Society electoral coalitions - to 
defeat Republica ns. , 

In ,consequence, the Democrats 
hold more elected offices today 
than at a n y time since the 
Roosevelt landslides of the 1930s. 
But under their shared liberal 
ethos, Democrats north of th e 
Mason-Dixon line are increasingly 
divided over whether government 
shou ld be an active tool for social 
equality - or conce ntra t e on 
helping middle-class Democratic 
voters defend their affluence in a 
period of rising prices and declining 
expectations. 

°In Ma sachuselts. Democratic 
Governor Michael Dukakis has 
geared his administration carefully 
to the needs of the suburban voters. 
many of them the children of white 
ethnics in Boston , who now are 
affluent and have moved to the 
suburbs . Nationally. Dukakis 
presents himself as a spokesman 
for " progressive" social legisla-
tion . But inner city leaders -
notably Boston ' s Mayor Kevin 
White - are disenchanted , and 
often angry , at what they regard as 
Dukakis ' failure to help those in 
Massachusetts who really need 
help. " Dukakis knows his future is 
with a (fluent whites," acco rding to 
one Boston official. " He doesn ' t 
give a damn about the old -
principles of liberalism." 

·In New York State. officials vie 
with one another in calling for 
federal aid for distressed New York 
City . They point out that federar 
policies constantly shift money and 
jobs out of New York into the 
Sunbelt. But many Democrats -
including Governor Hugh Carey, up 
for re-election this year - show no 
similar concern about tate policies 
that favor affluent commuters ove r 
unemployed ghetto youths . a nd 
help Scarsdale and Long Isla nd at 
the e xpense of hard-pressed New 
York City . Buffalo and Yonkers. 

·In Connecticut, c ity 'officials in 
the state capital of Hartford - hard 
hit by the urban c risis - make no 
secret of their disenchantment with 
Democratic Governor Ella Grasso. 
They assert she has betrayed the 
liberal coa lit:on that elected her. 
" Ella has decided she doesn ' t care 
about th e poor , the needy , the 
people in our ociety whom the 
syst~m always work a gainst ." 
according to one Connecticut 
liberal. "She has discovered that 
suburbanites can vote Democra-
tic." 

The growing debate over whether 
city, state and federal tax monies 
should be used as a tool for helping 
the poor or conversely as a prop for 
the threatened Ii ving standards of 
the middle class thus is unfolding in 
a strange environment - tradi-
tionally "liberal " Democratic 
politics. 

Just as the Panama Canal debate 
was both a debate o\'er a vitally 
important foreign policy matter. 
and also a debate over whether 
conse rv ati ves or m a i nstrea m 
Republicans would co ntrol the 
party of both Lincoln and Richard 
Nixon . so the current debate within 
the Democratic Party is a di spute 

Fellowship Program 
Now Open 

The PreSident 's Undergraduate Fe ll owship Program 
CompetitIon for 1978-79 is now open . This competition bas 
grown In popularity among UCSD students since its inception in 
1967. The program is deSIgned to assIst unusually talented 
undergraduate students to carry out special studies and projects 
under faculty supervision during term time and/or vacation . Such 
projects may include research and/or other creative activities . 

This year. another fellowship has been added to the 
competition in the name of David Jay Gambee. David was a 
Revelle student who was killed in a traffic accident just prior to 
this . acad.emic year_ The fellowship, established in memory of 

Da~ld , "':11t be awarded with preference to a student doing a

over whether the Party of both 
Franklin Roosevelt and Jimmy 
Carter will be one essentially of 
social principle or of broad 
electoral appeal. 

Few Democratic congressmen 
more graphically represent this 
evolution in Democratic Party 
politics than Representative 
Charles A. Yanik of Ohio. In 1975 . 
Yanik had a 95 percent approval 
rating from the A mericans for 
Democratic Action. The National 
Association of Manufacturers the 
same year gave Yanik a zero 
rating . Jack Anderson has lauded 

Vanik~ a member of the powerful 
Hou e Ways and Means Commit-
tee . as one of the House of 
Representatives' bes"t congress-
men, 

" He believes ." according to 
Anderson . " that the gaping 
loopholes that only benefit the rich 
are outrageous ," 

By every traditional tandard . 
Yanik is a liberal D mocral. par 
excellence . Yet Yani k - like 
Moynihan - today is the author of 
legislation which many liberals 
coniider a betrayal of Democratic 
principles. 

Representa tive James Corman 
of Los Angeles . for one. cri ticizes 
Vanik's proposal for tax credits for 
private education as "inequitable. 
inefficient. complex and probably 
unconstitutional.· · Education 
officials in many la rge cities fear it 
would result in white Americans 
torever a bandoning publi c 
education. and leave free public 
schools in this country with a lmost 
no future at all, 

What has happened, when two 
" liberal" Democrats can differ so 
profoundly on such an important 
issue? Congressman Yanik 
actually personifies in his own 
career how the Democratic Party 
has moved to the suburbs. 

Beginning in 1954. Congressman 
Yanik represented an inner city 
district of Clevland. Ohio. But by 
t968, that district - like so many 
inner cities in America - had 
become majority black. a ffl icted 
with America's most troublesome 
socia l problems. 

So Yanik, like so many of his 
constituents. moved to the suburbs. 
He defeated a Republican , and now 
holds what is widely considered a 
safe Democratic seat in Congress. 
Many of the voters who support 
Yanik in suburban Cleveland are 
the same ones that once voted for 
him downtown. before both their 
representative and his constituents 
moved beyond the city limits . 

Hav e liberal Democra ts tri -
umphed in a formerly Republican 
stronghold? Or has the kind of 
liberalism Democrats like 
Moynihan. Grasso. Dukakis and 
Carey espouse lost something in the 
translation from inner city 
neighborhood to affluent suburban 
life? 

As Di!mocrats like Corman and 
Yanik, both important members of 
the majority of one of Congress' 
most powerful committees, debate 
issues like tax tuition credits . they 
a re not only debating American 
ocial policy. They are debating the 

future of the Democra tic Party 
beyond the a pproa c hing 1978 
elections.

AS' first year marked by confusion, failure . 
by Gary Welmber, I 

This has been the first year of 
tbe resurrected associated 
student body governrnf,nt. As 
such, it comes as no surprise 
that it has been marked more 
by confusion, failure and 
frustration tban by success. So 
we can only be sympathetic 
wben the politicians in our 
midst look away from tlteir 
governmel)tal positions in the 
past • the 
UCSD histories of the future. It 
is now, at the end of their 
inagural year that the AS has 
made the effort to buy for itself 
a marker. It is a symbol that 
will mature and age as the 
government itself does. This 
symbol is an au tomatic 
oopcorn machine. 

But why a popcorn machine? 

Is there a meaning for this 
action that goes beyond a 
simple interpretation? I 
believe so. It is evident to me 
that this is not just an effort to 
improve the "quality of life" at 
this campus. The promises of 
parties and pubs so often heard 
from this year's candidates 
were just as loudly proclaimed 
one year ago. Like the Emper-
ors of Rome, once student 
leaders ' positions are assured 
they forget their promises of 
diversions for the masses. No, 
quality of life has not been an 
issue that has concerned the 
AS . Instead what we see here is 
a commitment to the deepest, 
most basic need a student has: 
improv ing the quality of 
education. 

In the university, change 
occurs in small increments. 
Little things : chang ing an 
administrator 's job descrip-
tion, re-prioritizing within 
approved budgets, receiving a 
grant from a large science 
foundation for weapons 

Gary Weimber~ is General 
Manager of KSDT. 
reserch, these add up over time 
and determine the path of a 
mighty institution. In the past, 
popcorn was seen in the 
Student Center only around 
finals. Now it is there all the 
time. Soon an FTE will be 
required to staff the machine. 
Next a Popcorn interdiscip-
linary Major will be estab-
lished, then a Popcorn Pr()-

gram and finally a Popcorn 
Department. 

Our student government has 
assessed the needs and worked 
to fill them. They see that the 
university abounds in cornballs 
but lacks in pop-cornballs . 
They also see that this is not an 
area of academic flabbiness , 
many of the sharpest adminis-
trative minds have blossomed 
from the heat of boiling oil 
around them. 

But let's be realistic. How can 
a Popcorn Depa'rtment be 
established when the Com-
munications Program is 
refused Departmental status 
time and time again? To realize 
the answer to this is to realize 
the depth of the student 
governments commitment to

the student body. Very wisely , 
the AS has taken no concrete 
action to help establish a 
Communications Department. 
When t he y approach the 
Chancellor for a Popcorn Dept . 
they will have a clean political 
record. Clearly the AS has 
learned (rom the mistakes of 
the Communications Program 
and will advance the following 
arguments: 

1) Unlike a Communications 
Dept. , the Popcorn Dept. will be 
designed (or the student of th 
'70s . Popcorn majors would not 
be politically active. The most 
political organization they are 
likely to join is the Pepsi 
Generation . 

2) Popcorn classes are easy 
to teach. If a professor needs 
more time for research, have 
him or her teach popcorn . It 
would free all but 15 minutes a 
quarter for the truly important 
part of the UC syste m , 
Research. 

3) A Pop~orn Majorwould be 
in line with the university's 
present Affirmative Action 
policies. True, a ll popcorn is 
white when it pops , but Indian 
corn can be used in separate but 
eq ual amounts . 

4) Un doubtedly popcorn 
entrepeneurs will be fresh 
sources for research funding . 
Perhaps the Chancellor will be 
enabled to finish his cu rrent 
project: a Popcorn and Cancer 
Research Center. To encourage 
even more funding he can offer 
to re-name Third College as 
Popcorn College. 

It is said that from small 
kernels great academics can 
grow . $400 is a small price for 
the student body to pay to begin 
this process . One can only hope 
that next year's student 
government will be equally as 
gifted with foresight and that 
they continue this g'reat 
tradition.

Greenpeace: trying to stop 
the 8eal slaughter ... 
(Continued from page I) 

Moore and Greenpeace legal 
advisor Peter Bellam, wno 
Taunt said had nothing 'to do 
with Moore's arrest , have 
cause d the orJanization to 
incu r a $25,000 htigation fee . 

Taunt says that the case rests 
on "a moral issue. ,. The 
question is, he feels , if 
Greenpeace has a rig ht to 
protect life as much as sealers 
have a right to take life . 
" Morally, we're right, " said 
Taunt. 

Ebberts, who did not venture 
out ontQ the ice but s tayed to 
block the Norwegian ships out 
of Halifax Harbor, said that the 
team set out at 5 am the first 
morning to learn when the ships 
would pull out to collect the 
pelts. 

"I just walked down to the 
docks, said I was looking for 
work, asked them when they'd 
be leaving and we chatted for a 
while," remembers Ebberts. 
" I could tell the guy had 3 
hangover. He was surprised 
later to learn that I was part of 
Greenpeace. " 

Ebberts said that he caught 
more of the verbal abuse than 
anyone else who sat in the 
Zodiacs. He said that the crews 
threw garbage, sprayed fire 
hoses and at one pOint threw a 
sawhorse near one Zodiac . 

Not economically feasible 
Also a crew member on two 

whale campaigns, Ebberts was 
most recently at sea in 1976, and 
said that there had been no 
noticea ble upkeep on the 
Russian ships, and that "They 
can see that it's wrong. It 's not 
even economically feasible." 

" There's a lot of ocean out 
there," said Ebberts, and adds 
Japa n and Russia each have 
two factory ships on the sea, to 
which the smaller ships called 
chaser or " killer" boats bring 
the harpooned whales . 

Both on the 1975 and 1977 anti-
whale campaigns , said Eb-
berts, the Russian whalers 
have fired harpoons over the 
top of Zodiacs . In 1976, he said, 
it " was evident that they had 
been given orders not to fire . It

would be stupid. There could 
always be an accident because 
a cable coul d come down 
anywhere. " 

'Here come those bloody 
Greenpeacers again!' 

He projected what goes 
through the mind of a Russian 
captain: " Here come those 
bloody Greenpeacers again!" 
as a small but courageous 
vessel bearing the Greenpeace 
flag appears on the horizon . 

During the last encounter 
with the Russians , Ebberts 
says that Greenpeace mem-
bers boarded the dock where 
whalers are taken aboa d and 
exchanged gifts with the crew. 
He observed some hostile 
gestures , but many were 
friendly and said, "We're not 
trying to take away their 
livelihoods, we 're just trying to 
save the species." 

Greenpeace is currently 
calling for a 10 year morator-
ium on all killing of whales, but 
the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) , in which 
there are 15 participating 
nations , is completely volun-
tary and called "perhaps oneof 
the greatest hypocritical farces 
on the face of this planet," by 
Taunt . 

Taunt cited the example that 
the IWC approved sperm whale 
catch quotas of 763 whales at 
the June 1977 meeting. Russia 
and Japan, the world's two 
major whaling nations , 
demanded that a special 
meeting be called in December, 
at which the Commission 
approved an increase of about 
850 percent of the catch quota , 
from 763 to 6,444 . The US was 
among the 13 nations that 
approved the increase. 

Greenpeace offices are 
internationally-based with 
locations in the US, Canada and 
in four European countries, A 
San Diego office has recently 
been established which spokes-
person Joe Goodwin said is 
"growing." Inquiries may be 
made at 223-1557,

Judicial Board ruling correct 
Editor: 

I prepared and presenwd the 
Thalheimer case before the 
JUdicial Board . If anyone 
deserves criticism for the 
presentation of the case it is me, 
not J.ori Dority. 

One must agree with the 
JUdicial Board 's ruling of 
suspension if one uses the 
standard of guilty "beyond a 
shadow of a doub t." This , 
however, was not a criminal 
case, nor was it before a regular 
court. It is almost impossible to 
produce evidence of the quality 
nec!!!;sary {or this standard 
without the use of a fulltime, 
trained investigator, rather 
than a parttime , untrained 
student (me) . I believe tha t 
there was enough evidence for 
disqualification if one used the 
civil law standard , that is, a 
" preponderance of evidence." 

Finally, to state that the case 
was lost on its presentation 
rather than its merits is a sari 
commentary on the Judicial 
Board 's proceedings (Mar k 
Stadler 's Commentary of 
5/5178) . The Judicial Board 

should not have punished UCSD . 
the elections (and misled the 
voters) if the evidence in the 
case indicated disqualification. 
Whether my presentation was 
feeble or not. it should not have 
entered their judgment if the 
evidence before the board 

indicated disqualirication was 
the correct ruling. I can only 
hope this was not the determin-
ing factor in its ruling.

Day care dispute ... 
(Continued from page 1) 
tee will deny it . they have been 
manipulated by the Administration 
and its lackey running dogs among 
the students to kill decent Day Care 
on this cam pus. 

This tragedy will not only affect 
those among us who cannot attend 
school without low cost day care 
that is up to the standards all 
parents wish for their children, but 
also to all those other human-
oriented programs that now or 
could exist within the university 
system. The Reg Fee Committee 
and the Administration cry poor in justific;ltion of their actions. I say 
bullshit. There is more than enough 
money to provide for decent day 
care. there is more than enough 
money to support other human, 
oriented programs, from religious 

groups to the Groucho Marxist 
Caucus. The fact of the matter is, 
someone in the Administration does 
not like day care on campus. 
although this person saw the great 
need for a yacht harbor in Mission 
Bay. Of course the big wigs can use 
a yacht harbor. but only students 
and staff can u e day care. 

It is time the student body of 
UCSD stand up and demand one 
hundred percent control over their 
money, and over all aspects of the 
running of this univer ity that 
affect them. The Day Care Center is 
only the first in the many programs 
that will be cut if prompt and 
decisive action is not taken now. 
This question will notgoaway in the 
summer, or next year. It is a basic 
question of values and priorities.

of a commu.~ications error earlier

he could be entered .n the race (his 
season's best of 15: 23 was well ....... 'Ic_ .... 
below the qualifying time) all the 
coaches agreed except for Krakes. 
The rulmg had to be an elllOtlOllal

by Krakes at USI as a freshm an

eligible for ationals. 

The other Triton runner in the 
race, Jon Halperin , displayed some 
of his best cross country form as he 
finis hed in ninth place with a 
persona l best of 33: 44. Halperin was 
up with the leaders for more than 
half the race until he developed 
blisters and fell off the pace. 

Triton coach Andy -Skeif was 
generally pleased with a ll of his

Concert 
Scene 

by Tim Mackenzie 
Arts Edil.Or 

Last Sunday's Angel/Head 
East Show at the Sports Arena 
more resemblcd a riot than a 
concert, featuring a pitched 
battled between Angel and 
their crew punching it out with 
the security guards. It was as 
far from Heaven on Earth as 
possible. . 

After the houselights began, 
'a band called the Godz came on 
and the spectacle that was 
Sunday night began. They were 
primItive , relentless and 
atrocious. The Godz need a lot 
more than what they gave if 
they hope to last a while in the 
biz , perhaps a few special 
effects. But then you'd think 
someone with the audacity to 
call themselves The Godz 
would have something else up 
their sleeves besides boogie, 
boogie, boogie . 

Following the brutal perfor-
mance of The Goelz was Head 
East. a top-notch rock 'n roll 
band from the Mid-west . 
Playing on a rather curious 
venue of showy rock music, 
these straight-ahead rockers 
delivered the best music of the 
night by far; at least it wasn't 
perverse . Making a few 
concessions to the audience 

(lead singer John Schlitt 
dressed in Rod Stewart hand-
me-downs), Head East played 
the good-time boogie rock that 
they play over two hundred 
nights a year. 

Standout numbers of the 
night were "Get Up and Enjoy 
Yourself" off of the new Head 
East LP and the Head East 
standard " Never Been Any 
Reason ." Working as much as 
Head East does , it's not 
surprising that they were that 

FROM: PARTICIPANTS OF THE ·U.C.- CHilD CARE CONFERENCE 
. . 

RE.: PROPOSED FUTURE OF THE : U.C.S.D. CHilD CARE CENTER 

May 6.1978 

The University of California at San Diego. 
in proposing to contract child care services to 
a private vendor. is taking a backward step 
toward becoming an elitist educational 
institution which fails in its obligation to ' 
provide equal access to women and families 
with low income. 

Chancellor McElroy. you have flagrantly 
manipulated and disregarded your own 
adviSOry process and violated the integrity of 
your Student Registration Fee Committee. 
The Registration Fee Committee is esta-
blished to provide a means to advise you 
independently on allocating stuQent-paid 
registration fe. for needed student services. 
You have disregarded the conclusions and : 
recommendations of your chosen Ad Hoc 
Child Care Committee-they recommended 
by an 11-2 vote to maintain the existing child 
care center and to reapply for State 
Department of Education (SDE) funding. It is 
dishonest to establish a participatory process 
only to ignore the recommendations which 
are inconvenient for you. 

Further, you have ' ignored the 
overwhelming student affirmation of the 
existing child care center. 4,000 of 9.000 
U. C.S. D. students signed petitions 
supporting the continued existence of the 
child care center with their registration fee 
monies. YOl, ave never before had such a 
clear manda'(e from students on the use of the 
funds. 

UCSC UCSD UCB 

We consider this decision-making process 
-to ' be intellectually. - morally and socially 
bankrupt. 

Your propose!'t Contract child care out to 
a private vendor is bad for children and 
exploitive of child care workers. SDE 
specifies staff-chlld ratios which are optimal 
for enhancing educational opportunities for 
young children. The 1 :12 staff-child ratio 
proposed by the private vendor is in violation 
of the ratios which are known to promote the 
healthy growth and development of children. 
The University. the foremost educational 
institution in the atate, is derelict in proposing 
the use of staff-child ratios deemed 
unacceptable by SDE. 

In a field traditionally staffed by underpaid 
women, U.C.S.D. is devaluing child care work 
even further by opting for a minimum wage-
paying vendor, as well as evading its respon-
sibility to affirmative action in its personnel 
policies. U.C.S.D. has an obligation to 
promote decent salaries and working 
conditions. A teacher who is paid a minimum 
wage while caring for twelve children all day 
is in an intolerable work situation. Such a 
teacher is available only because of the high 
rate of unemployment which your campus 
has no business exploiting. 

We demand that you fulfill your obligation 
as an educational leader by assuring the 
continued existence of your excellent 
campus child care center.

polished. Mike Sommerville's 
guitar playing was crisp and 
had a good bite to it, though It 
was probably up to the growling 
Roger on keyboards to make 
the show for Head East. 

"Sure we enjoy our reputa-
tion as a good concert band, " he 
said. " And incidentally, we've 
been playing really consis-
tently. So we're happy about 
that. But we feel that we've ,ot 
to be big in albums before we re 
going to really get going on a 
nationwide scale." 

It was around ten-thIrty wnen 
the lights went down for Angel. 
Using old magic as an aid, 
Angel d id it ' s patented 
" materialization" entrance. It 

'was impressive. Perhaps the 
most impressive part of their 
show, anyway, until the melee . 

In their designer white 
costumes, they really look quite 
ridiculous. But when they delve 
into song, it does become 
ridiculous. Worst.of the bunch 
is "guitarist" Punky Meadows, 
who comes as close to qualify-
ing as a musician as Jim 
Nabors . It was quite nauseating 
to watch him sashay' and fall 
around on stage whIle thrash-
ing his guitar, falling to his 
knees for extra effect. But at 
least his hair was perfect. 

The Angel set came to an 
abrupt end as lead singer 
Frank Dimino speared a 
security bouncer in front of the • 
stage with his mike stand . This 
after Dimino had enticed the 
audience to come in front of the 
stage. Anyway, a fight ensued 
between the security personnel

P.S. Your Cat is Dead 
"Dirty-Words' don't make a play 

by Jill Louise Bazeley 
Arcs Wriler 

One gets the feeling that 
Ca lifornia Pacific Theatre , 
which is quartered in Balboa 
Park 's old Puppet Theatre, 
chooses its shows on the sole 
basis of shock value. Now 
sometimes" shocking " is 
synonomous with " relevant", 
but as with the current 
production, P.S. Your Cat is 
Dead , "shocking " is just 
.. hocking" and nothing more 
- except , perhaps. boring. 
There are no dead cats on stage 
in this play, but it does feature 
most of the "Seven Words You 
Can Never Say on Television" 
and practically all the varia-
tions thereon . 

P,S. Your eat is Dead is about 
how Jimmy Zoole spends his 
New Year's eve. In his thirties , 
Jimmy is an insecure, second-
rate actor with twenty years of 
experience as being listed in 
theatre programs among the 
"monks, bellringers , virgins 
and hunchbacks ." He has just 
lost both his jobs, his girlfriend 
has walked out on him and his 
cat is dead. 

Despondent. and contemplat-
ing a quiet evening at home. 
Jimmy picks up quickly when 
he discovers a burglar has 
dropped in - the same one who 
earlier stole and destroyed his 
unfinished novel manuscript -
eight months worth of work. 

He is now out for revenge . He 
delivers a fast right to the 
intruder, Vito Antonucci, and 
acc identally leaves him 
unconscious. When Vito comes 
to, he finds himself strapped 
and tied to the kitchen table -
at the mercy of Jimmy and the 
forces of nature. which make it 
necessary for his pants to be cut 
away so he can relieve himself 
in the kitchen sink . (Vito 
remains bare-ended through-
out most of the production.) 

As one might expect in a play 
that uses the seven dirty words ~hings start to get " heavy" a nd 
Issues become the main foc us. 
Vito is bisexual. H and Jimmy 

d~velop a friendship - " just 
fmnds " - and the implication 
IS that they will live happily

ever after. (Except when Vito 
is frustrated because he has the 
hots for his super-straight pal.) 

Chava Burgueno gives an 
exceptional performance as 
Vito . He is at once ethereal and 
brutal, tender and mean . Wynn 
Rowell , who plays Jimmy , 
carelessly sloshe through his 
lines and brings his ch racter 
nowhere near the fiery , latino 

intensity and ambivalence of 
Vito. This P.S. Your Cat is 
Dead, though written by James 
Kirkwood and directed by 
William Virchis, is most 
definitely Burgueno 's show - it 
is funny because Burgueno is 
funny and it is touching because 
Burgueno is touching. But the 
fusillade of obscenities

(Conti nued from page 8) 
and the Angel crew, while the 
fire marshals ranted and 
raved. 

The trouble with Angel is that 
there 's just no substance 
behind the glitter of their stage 
show. Yel a mazingly . Angel' s 
new LP White Hot is far and 
away their best effort to date, 
featuring t he Single " Ain ' t 
Gonna Eat Out My Heart 
Anymore." The challenge for 
Angel is tosound as inviting live 
a they did on their LP.

I think Will Wright. and many 
others, are more effecti ve as 
professors or writers. tban they 
would be co llecting names for 
petition or organizing rallies. The 
'Best' methods are seldom so clear-
cut. nor universal , as Mr. Starr 
seems to think. But more impor-
tantly . in the attempt at social 
change, I think there are better 
' targets ' than others who share 
your goals a nd va lues. but differ in 
their methods. LI NDA R, SA80

Brahms concludes. 
symphony season ' 

The La Jolla Civic/University Symphony and Chorus will 
conclude its season on May 20 at 8 pm and May 21 at 3 pm in 
Mandeville Auditorium with one of the great rei igious works of the 
19th Century: arahms' German Requiem. 

The conductor for this fi nal concert will be chorus ' permanent 
director, David Chase. who will also lead the orchestra in Brahms' 
joyous, "Variations on a Theme of Haydn." 

Chase has been at UCSD since 1973. In addition to the chorus he 
conducts the Chamber Singers and Chamber Choir. He earned his 
Master of Arts degree from Ohio State University where he was 
composer and arranger for the University Chorale. Currently . he 
is a member of the faculty a t Palomar College. 

Brahms ' monumenta l work enlists two solo vocalists in addition 
to a large chorus and orchestra. Those solo roles on this occasion 
will be sung by soprano Kathryn Evans and baritone Christopher 
Lindbloom. Evans wi ll complete her Master of Arts degree in the 
UCSD music department in Ju ne. She is the leading soprano of the 
Young Artists ' Opera Theater, for which her most recent role was 
Fiordiligiin Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte ." She is as well a member of 
the Early Music Ensemble of San Diego and Musica Reperta. 

Tickets will be available at the door for $3, Adu lts and $1 
Students.

its sixth run, on an RBI-single 
by Frost. 

UCSD coach Chuck MiIlen-
bah, in a n interview Tuesday. 
said, "Yesterday's win was a 
typical team effort. Even 

thou~h all our games are won 
by Eileen. the rest of the team 
still has to perform . She 
(Eileen) is capable of striking 
out everyone but we still have to 
score runs . And our defense is 
outstanding.' . 

The game Monday was 
indeed typical , for the Tritons 
in general, and for McGirr. She 
picked up for sixth shutout and 
fifth one-hitter of the season 
Monday. She has also pitched 
three no-hitters, allowed only 10 
hits and four runs ( three 
earned) and struck out 91 
batters in 70 innings th is 
season. 

In addition, . as the Triton 
cleanup hitter, McGirr has 16 
hits in 36 times at bat this year. 

. The rest of the Tritons 
haven't b en too habby at the 
plate, either. l1CSD has scored 
78 runs on 81 hits this eason, to 
average almost eight runs per 
game. 

Now that the Tritons have 
finished their regular season 
undefeated , becoming only the 
second UCSD women's ·inter-
collegiate team to accomplish 
that feat , according to MiIlen-
bah. they will travel north to 
Ventura to pl ay in next 
weekend's AU-Cal tournament, 
where Millenbah said he 
expects to do well. 

"The All-Cal is the end of the 
season for us. We don 't have 
any regular playoffs , so the 
tournament's what we've been 
gearing toward. If we do the 
things we're capable of. we' ll 
do all right. The All-Cal teams 
are no better than any other 
team we've played this 
season, " he said.

News analyses have been abounding recently 
on the controversial Proposition 13, the Jarvis-
Gann Initiative (which would limit the property 
taxes on all real property to one percent of the 
full cash value of the property). The conclusion 
of many political pundits is that the "revolt" is 
one of a new mini" American revolution", with 
the people telling the ¥overnment that they've 
had "enough taxation. ' Quite enough. 

Dovetailing this sentiment (or, perhaps in the 
vanguard 00 has been the growing movement, 
seen particularly in the western United States, 
of the Libertarian Party, both in numbers and 
philosophy. 

A leading ,-ontributor to the Libertarian ranks 
has been World Research Inc. (WRI) , a firm 
located in nearby Sorrento Valley. In trying to 
gain a better understanding of " what 's 
currently happening", both in terms of their 
company and what they feel is occurring now in 
the country, and. interview was given. 

The first thing that was emphasized in talking 
with a " round-table" of six employees from 
WRI is that the word " individualism" is 
preferred to the term "Libertarianism" - and 
from that key word, " individual" - they say 
much of their philosophy is derived. 

Institute thriving 
WRI was founded in 1969 as a medium to 

spread the "word" , which included among other 
things the notion that the free enterprise system 
works" if left alone." From appearances sake it 
appears that the institute is thriving, producing 
newspapers, films and books. A primary thrust 
of WRI is to the college-aged group and to this 
end much energy is focused on the company's 
Campus Research Institute, which , among 
other things , distributes slick messages 
detailing pro-individualism and anti -
government stances. 

Preferring to term these messages as 
"educational" rather than " propaganda", WRI 
sees the mailings as important, not only (or the 
content but also because they view most 
colleges a "heavily biased", complete with " an 
unwavering acceptance of government in 
economy." 

WRI's reputation rests mainly on its 1974 
award winning film , "The Incredible Bread 
Machine ." The 32-minute documentary 
challenges the excesses and infringements of 
government (" the government doesn't produce 
anything") while promoting individual pursuits 
("individuals can solve probfem better tha 
the government") and concludes with the telling 
story and " sad fate" of Tom Smith, inventor of 
" the ·incredible bread machine." 

The film has made thousands of dollar and 
has had playing time in every state in the US, 
as well as in many other countries. Being 
important to WRI in not only spreading their 

name, the film also brings in revenue which 
allows the company to pursue other projects 
(including its most recent film, "Libra", soon 
scheduled for release) . Most of the rest of its 
money comes through what they term "small 
contributions. " 

Approximately 25 people are employed by 
WRI, and in talking with them, one thing 
became clear: their distaste ' for government. 
"It's not only that you work six months of every 
year for the government," said one member, 
"but even more importantly is the continuing 
government interference in every day life." 

Michael Newbrough, an Assistant Professor 
of Social Sciences at Palomar Junior College, 
said that is was "both ironic and tragic" that 
"the best thing we (libertarians) have going for 
us is increasing government control. " 

They see such control as the impetus for more 
people turning against government, which 
makes them increasingly vocal for "their 
individual rights as a person." 

As a movement, libertarianism seems to be 
.drawing from the fringes of various political 
groups - being so "far out" that it has qualities 
attractive to both rifht and left. Of the six 
interviewed at WRI al said they" at one time or 
another had been leftists", attributing this to 
what they view as " being surrounded by a 
culture weaned on being dependent on 
government. " - . 

. Not realistic 
"Let's face it, " said Patricia Morris, editor of 

the newspaper, World Research Inc., which has 
a circulation of 50,000, " the idea of a government 
that solves all ills is great. It appeals to the 
emotions. But we all know that uch a notion is 
not realistic ." 

Those at WRI say they face a problem: " When 
people hear the words " free market", they think 
we're trying to defend the system as is." In 
reality they are working for a " purer" system, 
one in which " big business and the government 
are not the same thing." 

"The free market corallary reflects upon a 
free society," said Bruce Stoddard. "It allow 
freedoms instead of restrictions in a numb r of 
areas. It is something government control have 
eroded." 

Because the b Iiefs of WRI deviate from 
mainstream politics, the organization and it ' 
politics are often labelled as " fa cist" by 
out ider - term that tho e of WRI say is the 
antithesis of the organization and goal . 

"Society benefits by individuals pursuing 
their interests," said Newbrou.gh. " Tha t ' s 
where we stand and what we are striving for." 

And for tho who disagree, WRI say they 're 
" ready , willing and able" to d bate or hold a 
forum on campus.
