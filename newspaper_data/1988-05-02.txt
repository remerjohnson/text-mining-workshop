New student 
credit union 

• • opens In sprmg 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
St.t/ Writer 

The UCSD Student Credit 
Union, which will combine with 
the existing University and State 
Employees (USE) credit union is 
scheduled to open next spring, 
pending the availability of space. 

The University Student Credit 
Union (USCU), was an idea put 
into action two years ago by 
Revelle senior Doug Hutshing. 
Because it will be combined with 
tbe existing USE credit union 
and will be working with in con-
junction with the A.S., it is 
expected to be one of the strong-
est banking facilities in compari-
son to other campus credit unions 
nationwide, Hutshing said. 

The search for space on the 
campus is currently the only issue 
for the Student Credit Union 
Orpnizin, Committee to solve. 

The space application, which 
has been submitted to the Space 
Board requesting the necessary 
square foot.ae to operate a 
bankina facility, willite reviewed 
within tbe next two months. 

Many student volunteers have 
spent time on tbe desi,n of the 
proposed student credit union, 
and acc:ordin, to Hutahin, it is 
becoming somethin, much hi.r 
than originally planned due to 
the Credit Union Organizing 
Committee's careful planning 
and cautious approach. 

Goals of the USCU are to 
provide financial services to stu-
dents to suit their needs from a 
cooperative organization while 
operatin, as a semi-autonomous 
union still in conjunction with 
USE, under the "for students by 
students" idea. 

"This combined structure as-
sures a continued accountabil-
ity, or a situation where we can't 
lose," said James. D. Kiewage, 
president of USE and faculty 
advisor. Kieweg and Vice Chan-
cellor Tom Tucker have been 
workin, closely for six months 
with the students on the commit-
tee to create the structure of the 
credit union. Committee mem-
ben include Matt Arrillaga, Brett 
Colbert, Gonzalo Ferradas, 
Doug Hutshing, Ted Haher, Tri-
sha Nelson, Sue Salgado, Ginny 
Velasquez, Rebecca Steinle, and 
Austin Spitzer. 

The USCU will be a subsi-
diary braDeh of USE Credit 
Union, and Kieweg will oversee 
this branch as well as the others 
of USE, but all current work on 
the USCU i done by students. 

"The most traditional unions 
are completely autonomous," 
Kiewig said. "But this [UCSU] 
will combine the professional 
management of USE, along with 
its 5140 million in assets, and the 
participation of students." 

Accordin, to both Kieweg and 
Hutshing, many student credit 
unions across campuses nation-
wide have been weak, not able to 
offer a great deal of services, and 
some have failed. 

"Many have undergone a type 
of 'run-before-walk' develop-

For Hegatitis B 
Prenatal screening advocated 

By KATHRYN GARVEY 
uc clip Slim 

DA VIS - Two University of 
California medical researchers 
have advocated routine prenatal 
screening for the hepatitis B virus 
and subsequent immunization for 
at-risk newborns to save "untold 
human suffering" and "millions 
of dollars annually." 

Currently the only pregnant 
women screened for the hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) are those consi-
dered "high risk,"noted Dr. Jose 

A. Arevalo, of the UC Davis 
School of Medicine, and Dr. A. 
Eugene Washington, of the UC 
San Francisco School of Medi-
cine, in an article published Jan. 
I S in The Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association. 

The paper is titled "Cost Ef-
fectiveness of Prenatal Screen-
ingand Immunization for Hepa-
titis B Virus." 

The UC researchers said trans-
mission from mother to fetus is 
high and "may be as high as 90 
percent ," depending on the 

mother'S infectivity status. 
The UC researchers acknowl-

edged that "new medical/ techni-
cal breakthroughs have the po-
tential for further increasing 
already mounting health care 
costs. " 

"Justifying recommendations 
that increase health expenditures 
is becoming obligatory. 

"This is particularly true of 
preventive medicine, where costs 
of new methodology must be 
outweighed by the potential for

Library 
• receives 

million 
dollars 

Florence Seeley Riford of La 
Jolla has donated a gift of $1 
million to the UCSD Library to 
provide materials for its humani-
ties collection. 

The gift if part of a challenge 
grant from the National Endow-
ment of Humanities, and is the 
largest donation thus far to 
UCSO's Challenge Campaign, 
according to University Librar-
ian Dorothy Gregor. 

"Gifts to the Challenge Cam-
paign generate federal matching 
funds equal to one-third of the 
contributed amount, to Gregor 
said. "Endowment income, sup-
plemental to state funds, will 
support acquisitions and pro-
cessing of library materials in 
four areas: Pacific Studies, Latin 
American Studies, contemporary 
humanities. and general hu-
manities. " 

Riford, 97, has contributed 
generously toward biomedical 
research in many areas including 
Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, and 
opthamology. "One of the ad-
vantages of having lived so long 
is that you become mor.e discern-
ing about human progress, to 
Riford said in a statement. 
.. Although medical and techni-
cal advances have been 
astounding, much remains to be 
done to enrich, encourage and 
develop the human spirit . I 
believe that many of the issues 
facing our nation today are moral 
and ethical in nature, and that it 
is the humanities which are best 
able to add less these challenges." 

"Words are really inadequate 
to communicate how much her 
loyal and generous support 
means to the University," said 
Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson 
in a statement. "The diversity, 
range and magnitude of her sup-
port have established a stari-
dard of generosity and wisdom 
that is inspiring. Her response to 
the University'S most pressing 
needs have been pivotal."

Chancellor Atkinson appointed to 
Carnelie Corp. Panel 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C . Atkinson has been 
named to a blue-ribbon panel created by the 
Carnegie Corporation of New York to assess the 
ways by which scientific and technological 
knowledge is being incorporated into federal and 
state government policy and decision making. 

The 21-member Commission on Science, 
Technology. and Government is co-chaired by 
Joshua Lederberg, president of The Rockefeller 
University, and William T. Golden, president of the 
New York Academy of Sciences. Panelists include 
former President Jimmy Carter and others who have 
served in top government posts. as well as eminent 
scientists and university presidents. 

Before coming to UCSD in 1980, Atkinson served 
for five years as director of the National Science 
Foundation. 

Prolram to aid minority engineering 
students 

A special program to aid undergraduate minority 
students who want to major in engineering is being 
planned at UCSD. 

The program, called the Minority Engineering 
Program (MEP), is scheduled to begin in the fall. 
MEP is a national program which provides 
academic counseling and support services for ethnic 
and underrepresented groups in the mathematics 
and science professions. 

Wilson said that the MEP program at UCSD 
would build on an already successful program for 
freshmen, the Honors Achievement Workshop, 
which has followed the MEP model. 

Honors Achievement Workshop provides special 
services, such as workshops, study groups and peer 
tutoring, to minority students in selected first-year 
mathematics, physics and chemistry courses. The 
MEP program would do the same thing with 
minority students in introductory engineering and 
computer science courses. 

Berkeley drives homeless from one

National Merit Scholarships, while 17 received both. 

Center Park. 
In an effort to guarantee the activists' right to 

protest. several city officials met with the 
demonstrators Sunday afternoon and offered the use 
of the park - under certain conditions. 

The city will temporarily provide the demonstra-
tors with water, portable toilets, trash removal, per-
mission to light fires "for cooking only," and other 
services. 

For their part, the demonstrators agreed to 
"conduct themselves in a manner so as not to offend 
neighbors and other users of the park," to use the 
toilet facilities provided, and to obey all city laws, 
such as those against public consumption of alcohol, 
illegal drugs and excessive noise. 

UC Irvine to offer guaranteed 
admission to transfer students 

UCI will implement a guaranteed admission 
program for community college students beginning 
with the 1988-89 application cycle. The program, 
"Zero in on Transferring" (ZOT), is designed to 
encourage students to transfer to UCI by formally 
assisting them with their academic and personal 
planning well in advance. 

Selected participants will receive assurance of 
admission to UCI as early as one year before actual 
enrollment. 

For more informatiotl about the ZOT Program, 
contact the Transfer Student Services Office, (714) 
856-7807. 

Panel discussion to be held by the 
Christic Institute 

A panel discussion will be held this WCdnesday, 
May 4 at 7 p.m. in Pete~on Hall 108 to explore 
national issues such as: Nancy Reagan telling the 
youth of America to "Just Say No." while the CIA 
told drug pilots to "Just Fly Low"; and whether arm 
shipments to Iran were approved by "President-for-
a-day" George Bush while Ronald Reagan was 
under the influence of medication. 

Local volunteers of the Christie Institute will 
conduct the panel discussion. 

The Christic Institute is a public interest law firm 
and policy center in Washington D.C. that currently 
has a $23.8 million civil lawsuit against 29 
defendants including many of the key players in the 
IranI Contra Scandal. 

Christie plaintiff Tony Avirgan will also be at 
UCSD to speak on "Drugs, Terrorism and 
Constitutional Integrity" at Mandeville Center 
Auditorium, 7:30 p.m. Saturday, May 21. The 
Christie volunteers will give a review of this event on 
May 4.

"Our analyses demonstrate the 
cost-effectiveness of such a pro-

However, one unpublished

The screening procedure and

Poway Brutality 
Poway, only a few miles from UCSD as the crow 

flies , has been the scene of some brutal events in the 
past week . 

On April 24, a 15-year-old girl was allegedly 
raped while a g roup o f men stood by and did 
nothing despite hearing her cries. It's the kind of 
t h ing people associate with a big city, not a sleepy 
town like Poway. 

What ha ppened next is unfortunately more often 
a ssociated with this a rea . Act ing on a description 
from the girl, who, among ot her things, described 
her assailant as a n " illegal alien," 27 sheriffs and 
border patrol officers in com bat fatigues and carry-
ing high-powered rifles swept th rough Po way and 
"detained" somewhere around 80 H ispa nic-looking 
"suspected undocumented aliens," the Union said . 

Would you, if you are a White UCSD student or 
staff member, be subject to a mass round-up at 
gunpoint , demands for "papers," detention without 
"cause" except ethnic heritage, or deportation? 

(The round-up is bou nd to hinder future criminal 
investigations. Many of those rounded up cooper-
ated with police in the interest of catching the rapist. 
Those who were, in fact. undocumented workers 
were deported for their trouble.) 

San Diego calls itself •• America's Finest City." 
For Hispanic people, it is "America's Finest Police 
State." The Immigration and Nationaliza tion Ser-
vice and the County Sherifrs Office are operating 
outside the bounds of common sense and common 
decency, not t o mention the U.S . Consti tution. 

We hope t hat the courts get an opportunity to rule 
on the legality of these broad community sweeps, 
and we hope tha t the man arrested for the rape, if 
he's guilty, doesn't escape j udgment because of high 
handed police actio n . 

Good Choices 
Someone we're close to, a fter a few months of 

general d issatisfaction with her life here, became 
a ware one-and-a-half quarters short of graduation 
that she really hates her major, biochemistry, and 
can't imagine except in her nightmares spending the 
rest of her life in a lab. 

She gets good grades, had a T A-ship and has 
excellent contacts in the faculty; in short , she has 
great job and grad school p rospects. 

But she wasn 't happy, and after considering 
leaving school has now decided to stay in school two 
or more years and dump biochemistry altogether. 

Her friends are perplexed . Why give up all she's 
studied fo r an uncertain future? Where are the 
bucks? What kind of prest ige career can you have 
without a science degree?(She's perplexed, too , but 
a lot happier.) 

What we noticed about the whole deal was that , 
first , a lot of her friends didn't know she was so 
depressed . Most ofthem are so focused on their own 
paths that they haven't noticed her increasing 
inability to focus on her school and personal life. 

Second, her friends have not been particularly 
supportive. She is dropping off the fast-track , they 
think. Don't all the best people at UCSD do science 
and go to grad school or med school or lab research 
jobs? People who don't have "serious" majors are 
wasting their time, the reasoning goes. 

That lack of support, personally and profession-
ally, is endemic to UCSD. We focus so hard on our 
practical , jOb-oriented majors that someone who 
needs something ditiel " .. ~ often has a hard time 
making that choice in thi~ pressurized environment. 

If you know people who are having trouble 
accepting what they're doing, or are becoming born-
again humanists (for lack of a better phrase), give 
them the love and support they deserve . The 
literature maj or you save may be your own. 

Our friend doesn't know what her new course of 
study will be, but we're going to cook d inner for her 
to celebrate anyway.

Deadhead 
Corrects Us 
Editor: 

Just a quick note from a Dead-
head waiting for Frost gig [last 
weekend]. Two major mistakes were 
fou nd in your very tasty article, 
"Live with the Dead." 

First, the " Hey Jude" coda was 
not the firs t California version . .. 
the fi rst California version was at 
the St . Pa t rick's Day shows at the 
Kaiser in Oakland this year. And 
yes, it was incredible; my face hurt 
from smiling so hard after Brent 
[M ydland, the Dead keyboardist] 
finished . 

Second, what I thought was really 
special about the final Irvine gig was 
the "Box of Rain" into "Looks Like . 
Rain." That was quite unexpected , I . 
must say. 

Other than these two points, the 
article was better than most I've read 
now that the Dead are "cool" to 
integrate into one's life.

the first point; however. the art icle

SDI is 
Dangerous 
Editor: 

I feel I must reply to the woefully 
misguided statements made by 
Martin Kies concerning the Strategic 
Defense Initiative (Guardian. Apr. 
28). 

His basic premise is that, " we owe 
it to ourselves and the world to 
counteract [the] world threat" posed 
by a ground-based missile defense 
system due to be deployed by the 
Soviets. He seems oblivious to the 
fact that the satellite-based SDI 
system is designed to give the United 
States a decisive strategic advantage, 
thereby creating an even greater ' 
threat to the world situation. 

Kies states that, "the only way we 
can fully understand SDI is to look 
at the ultimate loal of it." He fails to 
understand that the feasibility of the 

project depends on the solution of 
many monst rous technical problems, 
including system reliability and sur-
vivability, and target discrimination. 
Even an ideal shield-like system 
would not lead to the fabled "end to 
the arms race," as many weapons 
delivery systems (such as cru ise- a nd 
submarine-launched missiles) would 
not be affec ted. SDI would be a 
severely destablizing element in the 
power balance (you don't really 
think we would shoot down our own 
missiles, do you?), and would j ust 
happen to the be deadliest weapon 
ever devised against ground targets. 

I could now quote Kies' fourth 
and fifth paragraphs verbatim to 
support my own statements. As he 
says, no citizen of the world wants 
anyone country to have overwhelm-
ing military superiority - that 
applies to the United States as well 
as to the Soviet Union. 

"In whose hands will the world be 
safer: the United States or the Soviet 
Union?" Since the health and sur-
vival of our planet is at stake, 
everyone needs to realize that neither 
side can enforce safety by miiitary 
might; increased international un-
derstanding and cooperation offers

OPINION 

.Q&A 
With what cartoon character would you most want to be friends? 

What a silly question. J would 
pick Bugs Bunny because J believe 
he would think like me: pro-
space exploration since il will 
help fend off stagna/ion. and 
because all people will benefit in 
the long run; pro-animal experi-
mentation. because - wak~·up 
dammit - it saves HUMAN 
lives. Also Bugs Bunny is cool. 
and J like rabbits. 

Milo of Bloom County. flike 
his style. He's intelligent. He 
knows what is going on. and h~ 's 
nOl a wimp about acting on his 
beliefs. Also.a lot of my friends 
are like him. 

Lori Stahlam 
Senior. Muir 

Comm 

J don 't really 'know any ultra· 
conservative ca"oon characters. 
but J gu~ss it would b~ a thru 
way ti~ b~twun Opus. Bill the 
Cat. or Calvin (Calvin and 
Hobbes). Bill would be fun to 
party with. Opus is quite a 
scam mer. and Calvin is the ulti· 
mate philosopher. Too bad David 
Lee Roth isn 't a cartoon char· 
acler. 

Yogi Bear. because he 's really 
persistent. He likes food and J 
likefood. also because he digs the 

wild~,"ess. and J like it. too.

I'd like to be fr iends with Wyl 
E. Kyou. so J could help him 
catch the road runner.

Aquarium plans completed 

Artist's rendering of the entrance of the planned Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum. 

Artist's renderings of the de-
sign for the new Stephen Birch 
Aquarium-Museum at UCSD's 
Scripps Institution of Oceano-
graphy have been completed, 
Scripps Institution officials 
announced Tuesday. The design 
plans, by Wheeler / Wimer Archi-
tects of San Diego, will go before 
The Regents of the University of 
California in July for final 
approval. 

"We are very pleased with the 
design," said Dr. Edward A. 
Friedman, director of Scripps 
Institution. "We have a beautiful 
structure for one of the coast's 
most spectacular sites." 

The building design includes 

real hope for global security. 
The SDI program's professed 

goal of elimination of nuclear 
missiles is highly commendable, 
but political and tec1uW:a1 reali-
ties make the achievement of this 
highly unlikely. Even if the sys-
tem was properly deployed as 
envisioned by our military 
planners, there are serious doubts 
as to whether or not it would do 
anything to decrease the threat 
of nuclear disaster. 

An entirely separate aspect of 
the issue concerns the economic 
and moral consequences of 
spending billions of dollars on 
space weaponry when children 
are dying of hunger in our streets. 
K.ies mentions that the SOl con-
troversy has been partly sparked 
by "fear of the un known . .. 
Statements like those made in 
this letter make it painfully clear 
that much of the fear and lack of 
knowledge lies in the minds of 
SDI's supporters.

aquarium and museum display 
areas, a man-made tide pool area, 
and several public facilities , 
including a bookstore, an educa-
tion center, and scenic overlooks, 
The new center is scheduled to 
open in 1990. 

The new facility will be about 
two and one-half times larger 
than the present aquarium, with 
an estimated total of 31,000 
square feet of enclosed space and 
1 S,OOO square feet of outside 
space. It will be located east of 
La J ol1a Shores Drive on a knoll 
overlooking the central area of 
the institution and the coastline . 

The new aquarium-museum 

will be built at a cost of $8.2 mil-
lion. Currently, 57.6 million has 
been raised for the building 
project. 

According to Don Wilkie, 
aquarium-museum director, the 
new aquarium-museum will be 
an educatienal and cultural facil-
ity capable of making major con-
tributions to both the public un-
dentanding and wise use of the 
oceans. It will serve as a window 
to the ocean world and as the 
interpretive center for the re-
search conducted at Scripps 
Institution, Wilkie said. 

Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography is part of the University 
of California, San Diego.

Conversation: The same around the world 
By STUART WOLPERT 
UC Clip Slrrei 

LOS ANG ELES - Whether 
teenagers are talking on the 
phone in Los Angeles, peasants 
are speaking in a village in Tha i-
land, or workers are chatting in a 
New York upholstery store, their 
conve!sations follow many of 
the same rules, according to 
UCLA anthropologist Michael 
Moerman, author of the new 
book, Talking Culture (Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania Press). 

" Many languages and socie-

ties are completely different from 
ours, yet the formal rules of con-
versation - such as the process 
of speakers taking turns and the 
way speakers react to interrup-
tions - are the same," said 
Moerman, who has devoted 12 
years of research to. the field of 
conversation analysis. 

Talking Culture combines dis-
coveries in conversational analy-
sis with the lessons of cultural 
anthro pology, linguist ics and 
perception to examine relation-
ships among language, society, 
culture and thought. 

" We can not help but find our 
own culture, or any olher," 
Moerman writes, "by closely 
examining its talk." 

Moerman analyzed tape re-
cordings of many kinds of human 
conversations, including middle 
class American teenagers on the 
phone, a family in the South eat-
ing dinner, workers speaking in a 
New York upholstery store, 
callers to a Los Angeles suicide 
prevention center, a lawyer in 
Thailand speaking with a client 
accused of murder, and gather-
ings in Thai peasant villages. 

While there are many differ-
ences in the conversations, the 
rules and the formal structure of 
speech are surprisingly similar, 
he found. 

"If, for example, there is a gap 
of two-tenths of a second after a 
speaker invites a listener to do 
something, the speaker knows 
the listener is not interested ," 
Moerman said . 

"This is universal. The exact 
amount of time varies in differ-
ent settings, but I was surprised 
how short it is." 

Anyone who uses speech to 

gather information - a teacher, 
doctor, lawyer, psychologist, 
poli ce man , journa list , or 
anthropologist, for example -
must understand the rules of 
conversation, argues Moerman. 

" If [professionals] knew how 
language is organized, they would 
be aware that they are not neu-
tral observers, that they cause 
things to happen. They would be 
much more sensitive to how they 
ask questions. 

"Social interaction is basic to 
life; it is something people need 
to understand ."

U CSD curriculum lacking 
in Asian American Studies 

Editor's note: This article is 
the first of a two-part series 
regarding the Asian American 
Studies Committee. Part two will 
appear in this Thursday's edition. 

By DENNIS WOO 
G".,di." 'fttH" 

When Professor James Lin 
ran an Asian-American Studies 
course two years ago, there were 
only nine people enrolled to start. 
But after Shoon Liu got through 
"convincing" his friends to take 
the course (with considerable 
help for APSA - the Asian! Pa-
cific Student Alliance) the 
enrollment jumped to 50. That 
was quite a task, trying to get 
UCSD students to sign up fpr 
four units that wouldn't fulfill 
any requirements; more than 
this, it was a class that would 
count against them. 

"Jim told me, 'Wbat did you 
tell these people? Wben I had my 
office hours, all these students 
said that tbey took the class 
because of you.' I tried to con- . 
vince them that it would benefit 

Eating disorders: More than 
just the battle of the bulge 
By AUTUMN EHRMANN 
GUlUdi." /fttu" 

Despite all of the recent edu-
cation and increased awareness 
oft he general populace regarding 
eating disorders such as anorexia 
and bulimia, many people arc 
still finding themselves trapped 
in negative eating habits, a pro-
blem which can prove fatal. 

Why has anorexia recently 
become so prevalent? Dr. Beverly 
Harju, of UCSD's Psychological 
and Counseling Services, believes 
that much of the problem may 
stem from the idealism of the 
sixties. 

"It's my feeling that the sixties 
put a lot of pressure on young 
women to be achievers. What 
was difficult, however, was that 
there were not yet many suc-
cessful, ambitious women to 
serve as role models. It was, and 
still sometimes is, a conflict for a 
woman to see herself as roman-
tically attractive yet marketable 
in the job world . The Twiggy of 
the sixties was very non-threaten-
ing. It is very desexualizing for a 
woman to be thin and lose 
feminine curves." 

Fear of success seems to have 
been the prevalent reason for 
eating disorders in the sixties, 
but what about today? The cur-
rent causes of eating disorders, 
in both anorexics and bulimics, 
seem to be desire for control and 
insecurity with self-image. 

"Weight control, for these 
people, is an obvious way for 
them to be 'better.' It's a feeling 
that in having jobs, going to 
school, whatever, 'I have to have 
a better body before I go out that 
door. It, said Harju. 

Anorexia, the most widely 
known eating disorder, is charac-
terized by repeated dieting, dis-
satisfaction with one's physical 
proportions, and a body weight 

of 15 percent below normal. 
Anorexics, while extremely un-
derweight, will often focus on 
one negative part of their body, 
complaining that their stomach 
sticks out or that their legs are 
too big. 

"Anorexics usually come from 
perfectionist, compulsive fami-
lies." Explained Dr. Harju, "The 
parents are often very controlling 
and the young people begin to 
feel that their weight is the one 
thing in their life that they have 
control of. Also, studies have 
shown that a high percentage of 
the parents of anorexics are 
chronic exercisers and dieters 
themselves. It is a learned habit. " 

According to Dr. Harju, ano-
rexics are fairly easy to spot 
because of their extremely low 
weight, while persons suffering 
from bulimia often go unnoticed 
because they are usually average 

in size. While anorexics are 
usually trying to gain some sem-
blance of control in tbeir lives by 
chronic dieting, bulimics often 
binge, eating enormous quanti-
ties of food, because they have 
problems distinguishing between 
their emotional hunger and their 
physical hunger, said Harju. 
Whenever an 'empty' feeling 
comes over a bulimic, he or she 
will attempt to fill the void with 
food. Severe guilt will later cause 
self-induced vomiting, according 
to Dr. Harju . 

Almost all of the people who 
come in for treatment at UCSD's 
Psychological and Counseling 
Services do so because they them-
selves know that they have a 
problem. "They say that they are 
not living the kind of life they 
want to. They just want to give 
up that pain," said Harju. 

See EAT, pale 13 

Dr. Beverly Harju of Psychological and Counseling Services 
explained that "Anorexia and bulimia are often 'hidden diseases," 
so meeting with a group of peers is often helpful. " 

their psyche or spirit or whatever 
the secular word for spirit is .. . 
needs ... their need to establish 
identity, II said Liu. 

Sometimes; Liu just beued, 
which is to say he acted typically 
as a member ofthe Asian-Ameri-
can Studies Committee -
AASC. 

AASC has been a particularly 
active student lobbying group in 
the past year, as there has been 
greater motion toward obtaining 
as Asian-American Studies pro-
gram at UCSD. Until recently, 
the end of winter quarter to be 
precise, San Diego was the only 
UC campus without funding 
devoted to a permanent faculty 
member specializing in Asian-
American Studies. It was a rather 
conspicuous omission, consider-
ing 18.7 percentofUCSD under-
graduates are ethnically Asian, 
according to the fall 1987 Under-
graduate Profile. The Asian 
Americans were beginning to 
think something was amiss from 
the curriculum. 

"We feel that as students we 
have a goal in shaping the 
education we get, that it should 
not be left just in faculty hands," 
said Liu. 

"We want part of the program 
to be community-oriented and 
we do want students to shape the 
philosophy of ... ethnic-studies 
programs. We are the ones who 
arc the 'client,' to put it crassly," 
he continued. 

Reflecting on what he would 
want fom the Asian-American 
studies program - and ethnic 
studies in general - AASC 
member Oscar Aurelio said, "It 
provides something more to go 

the resolution indica~es a broad-
based student support." 

Liu pointed out that the com-
mitteee also developed its own 
proposal for an Asian-American 
Studies program. He is unsure of 
what happened to that proposal. 

"We've lobbied quite a number 
of faculty persons, geting their 
signatures on petitions that call 
for the establishment of an Asian-
American Studies program," Liu 
said. One version of the petition 
listed 300 supporters - signa-
tures from faculty, student and 
community supporters. Were the 
petitions very effective? 

"We haven't had any response 
from the administration, so it's 
really hard to guage whether 
they've been effective. They've 
been sent to Chancellor Atkin-
son, they've been sent to Vice 
Cha ncellor [of Academic Affairs 
Harold] Ticho." There's been no 
direct response to his knowledge, 
not even a letter. "I wish they 
would respond to these peti-
tions." He said that if the admini-
strators haven't received copies, 
they should contact AASC. 
"We'l send them duplicates." 

But despite the miscommuni-
cation between students and 
faculty, AASC saw the funding 
allocation for a faculty member 
as a victory, though guardedly. 
Liu pointed out that although 
the money has been allocated, a 
person to fill the position is yet to 
befound. He agreed with arecent 
committee on education policy 
whose recommendation to Vice 
Chancellor Ticho calls for the 
hiring of two permanent em-
ployees and an allocation of 
funds for visiting faculty. 

"We feel that as students we have a 
goal in shaping the education we get 
that it should not be left just in faculty 
hands." 

-Shoon Liu 
Asian American Studies program 

on than what's out there on the 
street, which are just stereotypes, 
jokes, or if you're studying your 
own ethnicity, something your 
parents told you. It provide~ 
more of a rounded study, hope-
fully unbiased study ... It's 
common sense to learn about the 
people that are in your country, 
to learn that they are more than a 
stereotype, that there's actually a 
person behind these stereo-
types." 

Since winter, funding has been 
set aside for hiring a single faculty 
member in Asian-American 
Studies, in part due to AASC 
efforts in "convincing" the ad-
ministration. 

"One of the questions many 
administrators have asked is, 'Is 
there student support?'" Liu 
explained. "What AASC had 
done in the past [at other cam-
puses] is to get the Associated 
Student government to pass a 
resolution stating that they are in 
support of Asian-American 
Studies and since they, the stu-
dent government, represents the

"I don't believe in incremental 
approaches because for me it's 
sort of this piecemeal approach, 
sort of a rag-tag way of imple-
menting any program. I think 
that incremental approaches to 
any program are. way of design-
ing a program that is destined to 
fail. I think that's the problem 
with quite a number of Chicano-
studies and Black-studies depart-
ments, actually all the ethic 
studies departments that were 
hastily implemented after the stu-
dent protests of the sixties. 

"You're goinlto have to make 
a large initial investment to make 
a good, strong academic program 
that will fulfill the needs of 
students, both Asian-American 
students and non-Asian-Ameri-
can students," Liu ·said. 

The community has been from 
time to time about as difficult to 
convince as the administration. 
Liu noted an irksome AASC

O'Connor's Asian Advisory Com-
mittee.

that they were 100 percent behind 
us, but they felt that they needed 
figures - what arc we really 
talking about in terms of costs of 
the program. We didn't expect to 
be asked that type of question, II 
Liu said. 

"We try to make it clear to the 
community that we are students 
and that we don't have the clout 
that we wish we had , and that we 
have to worry about our school 
work and our grades. I think it's 
shameful that students have had 
to expend so much energy in 
trying to get a program such as 
this. We have our own course-
loads to worry about, II Liu 
added. 

At the AASC office in the 
Student Center, Oscar Aurelio is 
chairing the meeting. He's trying 
to keep it down to 45 minutes 
- long meetings have been a 
committee problem. AASC 
member Dixie Diaz pulls away 
from her notes - she is doing the 
engineer's twirl, spinning her pen 
like a pinwheel on the back of 
her thumb. She ribs Samoa Koria 
about his being selected as Con-
grcuman Jim Bates' "Citizen of 
the Month." 

"The biuest pilser for me," 
Koria said, "is that in five years 
they've established the Graduate 
School of Pacific Rim Studies 
and International Relations, 
which is studying all these people 
euewhere. And here we are for 
20 years tryinl to struule for 
Asian-American studies on this 

campus, to study people here 
and in five years the chancellor 
and the UC Regents have estab-
lished this [other) school. Given 
that fact alone, I think that the 
Asian-American Studies pro-
gram should be established right 
now, this minute. The pisler is 
that they have not been open to 
establish the program." 

The committee moves on to 
discuss AASC's recent partici-
pation at the 10th anniversary 

"I think it's shame-
ful that students 
have had to expend 
so much energy in 
trying to get a pro-
gram such as this." 

-Shoon Liu 
AASC 

conference of the Asian! Pacific 
Islander Student Union (APSU), 
a statewide network of Asian-
American student organizations. 
The conference wu held in late 
April at Berkeley. 

In a -skit at Berkeley, Liu 
played "Joe Conscience" haunt-
ing "Joe Asian." He challenged a 
bespectacled (of course) Asian-
American student to confront 
his ethnic identity. "Yo! This is 
your conscience! Wake up, ass-

hole! You assimilated dipshit, 
this is your worst nightmare ... 
Freddy Krueger, move over!" 

As for the rest of the con-
ference, Liu thought it ironic 
that UCSD students had to travel 
500 miles to Berkeley, where the 
event was held, to find out the 
state of Asian-American Studies 
on their own campus. Was it so 
ironic? Isn't AASC the Berkeley-
sixties thing all over again? 

"We are indebted to the Third 
World Strikes of the sixties. Our 
struggle would not have existed 
if they had not laid this foun-
dation. Sit-ins and strikes are 
still viable options for students 
to take, II Liu said. "But also we 
feel that we have to put a broader 
and long-range perspective on 
things. We want courses and 
curriculum that are academically 
recognized, that are salient to 
resell"':~. and that faculty who 
teach these courses will get tenure 
on the basis of their research. 
But at the same time, we also 
want a program that is responsive 
to the community," he added. 

What did emerge from the 
APSU conference held at Ber-
keley in 1988 was an educational-
rights bill that will be put forth at 
a conference to be held at Stan-
ford University on May 14. "We 
call for the establishment of 
Asian-American Studies courses 
and improvement of existing 
programs," reads one line form 
the APSU education bill. The 
conference is being sponsored 
jointly by three ethnic minority

Eating 
disorders 
Continued from page 10 

Once a person goes to UCSD's 
Eating Disorders Clinic for initial 
treatment, he or she will have a 
first interview with a counselor 
and together they will plan what 
program is best suited for his or 
her particular needs. Most people 
are placed in a group consisting 
of five other people with eating 
disorders, a peer counselor who 
has overcome an eating disorder, 
and a staff member. 

"Anorexia and bulimia arc 
often 'hidden diseases,' so meet-
ing with a group of peers is often 
very helpful. They usually also 
meet with a psychologist for 
private counseling once a week," 
said Harju. 

"Anorexics usu-
ally come from per-
fectionist, compul-
sive families." 
-Dr. Beverly Harju 
Psychological and 

Counseling Services 

These groups definitely seem 
to work. "In the course of a year 
in counseling here, at least 70 
percent of the people have given 
up their compulsive eating," said 
Harju. 

After people give up the pat-
tern of excessive dieting or binge-
ing and purgeing they can go to 
recovery groups. "These groups 
are for people who have com-
pletely gotten over their eating 
problem, but are still in the pro-
cess of understanding their feel-
ings and realizing what kind of 
person they want to be," ex-
plained Harju. 

UCSD's Psychological and 
Counseling Service is approved 
by the American Psychological 
Association and is free for stu-
dents as all costs are prepaid by 
registration fees . Students wish-
ing to receive further information 
or set up an appointment can do 
so by calling S34-3987 .

Commentary_ 
Revealing the origins of Cinco de Mayo 

By ADRIANA ALVAREZ 
MECIIA ".~".~, 

Cinco de Mayo has continu-
ally been dubbed the "indepen-
dence day" of Mexico, analo-
gous to the revolutionary Fourth 
of July here in the United States. 
It has too frequently been mis-
taken as the day that Mexicans 
won their freedom from Spain 
when, in fact , the true Mexican 
revolution took place nearly four 
decades earlier than May 5,1862. 
That day found the Mexican 
people in a conflict with the 
imperialistic French who, in their 
military attempt to establish a 
monarchy in Mexico, were held 
back by serious losses incurred 

by resisting Mexicans. 
Rather than a turning point in 

Mexican rule, Cinco de Mayo 
was a moral victory, its true 
value stemming from the fact 
that it sparked the motivation 
and d ignity of the Mexicans 
which would ultimately prompt 
them to oust French foreign rule. 

After the people of Mexico 
overthrew Spanish rule and 
established the Constitution of 
1824, much of Europe waited for 
Mexico to stumble. Among the 
money lenders that aided the 
new republic were France, Eng-
land, and Spain. Their interests 
in Mexico were far from altruis-
tic, for their main goal was to 
collect much more money from

the young country then they lent 
to it. Diplomats from Europe 
were sent to Mexico to explore 
the new government and came 
back to their countries with 
biased accounts of the barbaric 
and primitive rule Mexico had 
established. 

In 1861, the three European 
powers agreed to collaborate in 
collecting their money, and 
decided to sail to Mexico to 
claim a few of her seaports in lieu 
of revenue . England and Spain 
sought nothing more than to 
secure their collateral, but France 
had ambitions of conquest. 

The French warships stayed 
on, and on May 5, 1862, with the 
consent of France's minister of

war, they attacked Forts Loreto 
and Guadalupe, as well as the 
famous town of Puebla. General 
Ignacio Zaragoza, leading 2,000 
Mexican soldiers, drove the 
French back with serious losses, 
and won the day in their valiant 
fight for freedom. Though France 
eventually manaled to pin con-
trol of Mexico and establish the 
puppet emperor Maximilian in 
1864, the French conquest was 
an unstable one, and Maximi-
lian was deposed and shot on 
June 19, 1867. Never apin was 
Mexico to be governed by for-
eign rule. 

Cinco de Mayo's effects on the 
Hispanic community are ex-
pressed more fervently in the 

United States than in Mexico . 
While many Mexicans see this 
holiday as a representation of 
only temporary victory, the idea 
it conveys is that of liberty and 
equality, which undoubtedly 
appeals to the many Mexican-
Americans who are deeply influ-
enced by American democracy. 
Community orlanizations 
throulhout the southern regions 
of Arizona, Texas and Califor-
nia celebrate this event. 

Cinco de Mayo was a moral 
victory, and Mexicans every-
where celebrate it as such. It is a 
consistent reminder of the filht 
for equality in the world, a 
struggle that is still a reality for 
many Mexicans today.

Women's tennis wins 
Menlo Championships 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Stf4IJ Wrltn 

The Triton women 's tennis 
team won three matches to cap-
ture this weekend's Menlo Tour-
nament in their final tune-up 
before heading to Atlanta, 
Georgia to defend their national 
championship. 

Opening the tournament 
against an extremely weak Col-
lege of Notre Dame squad, the 
Tritons swept to an easy 9-0 vic-
tory. In the match, no Triton was 
forced to play three sets and 
most did not give up more than 
one game the entire day. 

In the second match, against , 
UC Santa Cruz, another weak 
Division 111 team, the results 
were equally profitable. As in Ihe 
first match, the Tritons swept to 
an easy 9-0 victory, losing very 
few games and no sets in the 
individual matches. 

Menlo College finally gave the 
Tritons a test in the tournament 
finale. Still, the tritons were able 
to prevail 5-4 in a match that 
wasn't quite as close as it seemed. 
After the six singles matches, the 
Tritons led 4-2 with victories by 
Rhonda Meier (in a controver-
sial match), Janet Whalen ,

Continued from pale 10 
schedule, we have an excellent 
pitching staff, we have momen-
tum, and we have the edge in 
head-to·head competition 
against San Bernardino," Yates 
said. (UCSD had won two out of 
the three games they have played 
against each other this season.) 
"If I were to pick the best two 
teams from the west coast this 
year who deserve to play in the 
regionals, there is no question I'd 
pick Cal State Stanislaus and 
us," Yates said. According to 
Yates, Stanislaus has a virtual 
lock on one of the two spots. 

Despite their excellent chan-
ces, the Tritons still have to win 
at Pomona-Pitzer on Tuesday to 
seriously contend for that final 
playoff spot. Yates mentioned, 
however, that UCSD should have 
little trouble taking care of them, 
and that without il victory on 
Tuesday he would not even con-
sider the Tritons for post-season 
play.

Kristen Diels and Susan Carney, 
and they needed only one victory 
in the final three doubles matches 
to clinch the win. They got it very 
quickly as Christine Behrens and 
Meier took the first match 6-3, 
6-4. 

The victory over Menlo 
showed the depth that has made 
UCSD(18-4 with no Division III 
losses) the top-ranked team going 
into the national tournament . 
Although their top two players 
were defeated , the Tritons' 
lower-seeded players were able 
to win their matches to save the 
victory. 

In fact, every player, except 
Meier, won relatively easily in 
straight sets. Meier ' match was 
a close and controversia l affair 
which the Tritons' No. 3 player 
was able to pull out, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 
with some help from tournament 
officials. 

With match tied at 5 in the 
third sets, Menlo College's Janet 
Matthews was serving with the 
score ties 3-all in the no-ad-
vantage scoring game. She hit a 
serve that apparently lan4ed well 
in the service square, but a rov-
ing umpire called a foot fault, 
giving Meier the game and an 
opportunity to serve for the

, 

match. She didjust that, winning 
the final game easily to take the 
final set and the match. 

Although both players had 
been warned earlier and Mat-
thews clearly foot-faulted , the 
Menlo coach argued that it was a 
poor call since it was made at 
such a crucial stage ofthe match. 

The only question mark 
emerging from the tournament 
was the play of Christine Behrens. 
Behrens, one of the top-ranked 
players in Division III , was 
beaten quite easily by Caroline 
Bodart, 6-4, 6-2. Bodart, a Bel-
gian clay court player, was able 
to throw off Behrens' game with 
her slow style of play. Behrens 
made numerous unforced errors 
as she seemed to have trouble 
keeping the ball in play with 
windy conditions . 

Despite the loss, Coach Liz 
LaPlante remained relatively 
unconcerned. "I think it's good 
that she lost Saturday. The girl 
who beat her in last year's 
nationals played the same game 
as Bodart. Now, hopefully, she 
knows what she has to do to win 
against a player of this type." 

The National Tournament will 
feature the top eight Division III

Baseball 
close to 
playoffs 

Hot Tritons 
win fourth 
. In a row 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Stll/! Writer 

The UCSD baseball team took 
two major teps toward the 
western regionals over the last 
few days by posting vital win 
over both Cal State San Bernar-
dino on Thursday and Southern 
Cal College on Saturday. The 6-
3 and 4-2 victories, respectively, 
improve the Tritons overall 
record to 24-12, and keep their 
winning streak alive at four. 

Thursday's contest with Cal 
State San Bernardino featured a 
three-run eighth inning by the 
Tritons in which they broke open 
a 3-3 tie. Rick Nowak picked up 
the victory for UCSD, while 
Triton defense performed almost 
flawlessly as it committed only 
one error. 

The defense did an even better 
job on Saturday against South-
ern Cal College, when it made 
absolutely no errors and pro-
vided support behind starting 
and winning pitcher Dave 
Adamson. I~e complete game 
victory improved Adamson 's 
record to 6-2. 

Although Thursday's game 
against San Bernardino may have 

been more important consider-
ing the fact that it had more 
direct impact on post-season play 
(both UCSD and Cal State San 
Bernardino are in solid conten-
tion for a spot in the regionals), 
Saturday's contest was also 
important because Southern Cal 
College is vying for a spot in the 
NAIA TournafTI""t. 

"We knew it wasn't going to be 
an easy game," said Triton Head 
Coach Lyle Yates. "They had 
won eight straight and they were 
throwing a very tough pitcher." 

This did not appear to bother 
Erik Judson or Dave Nowlan 
much, as they teamed up in the 

• 

eighth inning to score the two 
runs which gave UCSD its two-
run margin of victory. 

With two outs and nobody on 
base, Judson walked, and when 
Nowlan (in an unusual pinch-
hitting role) ripped a double 
down the left field line, Judson 
used his speed to score all the 
way from first. Noticing that the 
throw from the Southern Cal 
leftfielder was heading towards 
home, Nowlan attempted to 
stretch the hit another base. 
When the catcher's throw down 
to third bounced past the third 
baseman, Nowlan scored the 
Tritons' fourth and final run of 

the game. Shortstop Brian Craw-
ford added a two-for-three per-
formance to spark UCSD of-
fensively. 

Currently, the Tritons are 
ranked eighth in the country in 
Division Ill, but because the 
rankings have not been updated 
since last Wednesday, UCSD 
should be expected to move up 
when the next rankings come out 
in a couple of days. As far as 
playoff chances go, Yates remaiDJ 
optimistic. 

"It looks as if we have a good 
chance to make the playoffs," he 
stated. "We have played a tough

Triton-fest 
Athletic council 
begins a new 
tradition 
This Wednesday, May 4, the 

UCSD Athletic Department, in 
collaboration with the Triton 
Athlete's Council, will be host-
ing the first annual Tritonfest on 
the grass next to U rey Hall. 

The event was the brainchild 
of the Council. The 22 athletes 
representing each collegiate team 
chose Tritonfest in an effort to 
showcase their programs and 
allow students to see athletics as 
an integral part of the University. 

Twenty-five booths will be set 
up, beginning at noon and last-
ing until 7 pm. Booth themes 
range from food (nachos to pizza) 
to game booths to a massage 
table by the women's tennis team. 
Each game usually coincides to 
the team running the booth. For 
example, the baseball team will 
have a radar gun timing the fast-
est arms, the track team will be 
running an obstacle course and 
the crew team will have a rowing 
machine set up. 

Small prizes will be awarded 
at the booths as well as raffle 
tickets. At 7 pm, the rame will be 
held to award larler prizes, such 
as dinners and gift certificates. 

A disc jockey will be playinl 
records from 5-7 pm and Food 
Services will be setting up a Mex-
ican dinner on the lawn so that 
students can use their meal cards. 
Those students without meal 
plans can pay 54.50. 

Triton waterpolowins weekend tourney 
Three goals by Lillian Lathrop 

and two more from Kristen Lar-
son helped the UC San Diego 
women's waterpolo team defeat 
the UC Santa Barbara A team 
6-4 to win their own tournament 
this past weekend Apri129-May 
1) at Canyonview. 

"The final game was extremely 
intense,"said Head Coach Denny 
Harper. "We had a real strong 
team effort, especially on de-
fense ... 

Tough defense limited the No. 
1 ranked Santa Barbara team to 

four goals. Triton goalie Jeffi 
Paulsen had "an awesome game" 
with 16 tough saves against the 
powerful UCSB arms. 

"We knew, going into the 
game, that Santa Barbara had 
more talent. They have two 
players on the national team. We 
worked as a team and that was 
what made the difference," Coach 
Harper said . 

The Tritons began the tour-
nament with a 17-3 win over Cal 
Berkeley. They then polished off 
UC Irvine and Cal Poly San Luis 

Obispo 22-4 and 13-5 respec-
tively. 

In the semi-finals, UCSD faced 

to 12-3. However, it should be 
noted that the three losses have 
been to club teams. UCSD re-
mains undefeated against colleges 

[The Tritons are] expecting to be ranked 
No. 1 in the [National] Tournament. 
the UC Santa Barbara B team 
and again won easily, 15-2. 

The five wins over the week-
end improved the Triton record 

and universities. 
Although the women's water-

polo team is not associated with 
the National Collegiate Athletic 

Association, they will still partic-
ipate in a national tournament 
towards the end of May. Coach 
Harper is expecting to be ranked 
No. I in the tournament because 
of the win over Santa Barbara. 
The Tritons are currently ranked 
No.3. 

UCSD will complete its short 
season this weekend with pmes 
against Pomona-Pitzer <at Can-
yonview) and two matches 
against club teams. Then off to 
Napos, Maryland for the national 
tournament. 

One-two-th, .. - Triton goalie Jeffi Paulsen recorded 16 saves against UCSB in the tournament finals on Sunday.
