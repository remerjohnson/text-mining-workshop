Chancellor says he would not interfere with V-C search 
McElroy urged Hunt for Student 

Affairs position, sources say 
by Mark StacDer 

Otancellor McElroy attempted 
to influence his Vice<hancellor of 
Student Affairs search committee 
to consider Howard Hunt, the 
acting Student Affairs Vice-

search for a permanent 
replacement. 

The committee expects to make 
its final recommendations to 
McElroy by the middle of next 
month. (Triton Times, Oct. 14) 

The committee can consider 
anyone who applies for the vice-
chancellorship," McElroy said 
both Tuesday and yesterday. 

Acting Vlce-Chencellor of Student AHaira Howerd Hunt ' chancellor, along with the seven 
other finalists for the pennanent 
position, the Triton Times has been 
told. 

"Not applied" 

One source confirmed that 
students had talked to McElroy 
about Hunt. The source said a 
small group' of "student activists" 
have to10 McElroy they think Hunt 
should remain as Vice-chancellor 
because he's just as qualified as 
the seven finalists and he has 
proven himself capable during the 
six months he has filled the tem-
porary position. 

$107,000 in Reg Fees 
remain in q'uestion 

by Alan Russell 
Editor 

Controversy continues to build 
over allocations of $107 ,000 made 
this summer by the administrative 
staff of student Affairs (TT : Oct. 
7). 

A meeting was held Thursday by 
the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs (Reg. Fee) 
to look into the charges of 
"misappropriation of funds ." 
Testifying before the committee 
was Howard Hunt, acting Vice-
chancellor of Student Affair! and 
five members of last year's Reg 
Fee committee (Bob Simon, Bert 
Lee, Marsha Harris, Oscar Moreno 
and Arm Carberry). 

The $107,1)00 in question can be 
traced to state allocations received 
this summer that were in excess of 
the $486,000 the Reg. Fee com-
mittee was expecting. The money 
was consequently allocated by the 
Vice<hancellor's office. 

The matter of these allocations 
drew only angry remarks by the 
former Reg. Fee members at 
Thursday's meeting. Agreeing as a 
whole, the group insisted that they 
had received assurances from the 
Vice<hancellor's office last year 
that any excess money would be 
banked, not spent. 

Of further concern to the former 
members was the fact that money 
had been spent on programs that 
the committee had specifically 
recommended not be funded. 

MemOi empbaslzed 
Also emphasized were two 

memos sent to the committees 
(April 6 anclApril 'l1) from former 
Vice-chancellor of Student Affairs 

George Murphy in which he 
assured the committee that its 
advice would be sought prior to the 
reallocation of future savings and 
that no new full time equivalent 
would be added to the Reg Fee 
budget without prior consultation 
of the committee. 

Bitter comments were heard by 
the former members, with the 
acknowledgement of "betrayal" 
voiced by all. Oscar Moreno, last 
year's Reg Fee eo<hair, was 
perhaps the most vehement, 
say'ing, "We put our faith in the 
Vice<hancellor's office and in the 
integrity of that office. I don't know 
where that integrity has gone. " 

Howard Hunt, acting Vice-
chancellor; emphasized in ·an -in-
terview that, " All that I did I 
thought was in the best interest of 
the students. The money allocated 
I believe meets their needs in the 
most equitable manner." 

Hunt also said that, "the figure 
$107,000 is not a realistic one." He 
cited " mandated contractual 
figures that we had no choice but to 
pay," as accounting for "the true 
figure of $69 ,000 which we 
allocated." 

Future diSCUSSjODB 
Admitting that the "previous 

committee should perhaps have 
been consulted," Hunt never-
theless asserted that " the vice-
chancellor must have some 
discretionary powers to do the job 
in a proper manner." He further 
stated, though, that he would "ask 
the advisory committee (Reg. fee) 
to examine and discuss any such 
future matters."

Stricter AdmiSSion 
Standards for UC 

UC admissions standards are now more strict after the UC Regents 
voted Friday to increase its reliance on Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 
scores and to require a fourth year of high school English in determining 
selectioo. 

Formerly, SAT scores were only considered when the applicant had a 
grade point average between 3.0 and 3.1. Those below 3.0.are not eligible 
for admission. 

The grade point average of a student will carry six Urnes the weight of 
test scores under the plan, but test scores will now be a determining 
factor in admitting all applicants. 

The vote was 13 to 12 at the meeting held in San Francisco, with the 
emotional and philolophical controversy causing a rift between those 
Regents who are nonnally aWed. 

State Supert.-endent of Public Instruction Wilson RUes, a black 
Democrat, voted in favor of the move, ..-Ie he felt pressure from various 
groups, includinl the NAACP, to vote IPinIt it. 

Those Regent. who would normally vote concurreraly with RUes but 
who voted apinpt the measure were Govenw»r Brown, Assembly 
Speaker Leo McCarthy, Ueutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally, regents 
Chainnan WlWam O»bleiU and ali Democrats and ex~fjcio members. 

Proponeata look to UIUI'e academic excellence among UC students 
while they did add that special provisions would be made to insure that ~ 
minority student would be excluded becauae of the new emphasis 00 test 
scores. 

McElroy suggested the com-
mittee consider Hunt during a 
meeting three weeks ago with 
committee chairperson Murray 
Goodman, according to sources 
close to the Search committee and 
the admisistration. 

" No interference" 
When asked yesterday about the 

allegations, McElroy said there 
was "no way" he would suggest the 
search committee to consider 
Hunt, because he does not want to 
interfere with the search process in 
anyway. 

Goodman also denied that 
McElroy ever attempted to in-
fluence the committee. "It's just 
not true," the chemistry depart-
ment chairman said. 

_ When Hunt assumed the acting 
vice<hanceUorship, he said one of 
the conditions he and McElroy 
established was that he, Hunt, not 
seek the permanent job. 

Yesterday, McElroy said if the 
search committee recommended 
Hunt for the permanent position, 
he would accept the recom-
mendation. 

HIL'lt was IIamed to the acting 
position by McElroy after George 
Murphy resigned the post in april. 
Soon after that, the Chancellor 
appointed a committee, comprised 
of undergraduate students, ad-
ministrators, faculty and staff 
members, to conduct a nationwide 

According to the sources, 
Goodman, at the meeting three 
weeks ago, told McElroy the 
search committee wasn't con-
sidering Hunt because he had not 
applied for the permanent job. 

McElroy asked if Hunt would 
apply if he, the Chancellor, said it 
was all right for him to do so, the 
sources said . 

When Goodman took this news to 
Hunt, sources said Hunt told 
Goodman that he would apply for 
the post if it was alright with 
McElroy. 

Goodman then asked the search 
committee members if they would 
reopen applications for Hunt, and 
the committee members refused, 
according to sources. 

Hunt, when asked last week if he 
would accept the offer of the 
permanent vice<hancellorship 
from McElroy, refused to com-
ment. "It's an unfair question," he 
said, beacuse any answer he gave 
might interfere with the search 
process. 

Hunt also said it wouldn't be fair 
for him to now be considered with 
the search committee's seven 
finalists, because he hasn't gone 
through, the search process. 

In an earlier interview, con-
ducted last Tuesday, McElroy said 
several students have recently 
asked him to consider Hunt for the 
permanent position. He said he told 
thm to tell the search committee of 
their feelings. 

M..,... of the Union of .J.wleh 8tudenta 
Information about 1 ..... 1 In R.v .... plaza. 

When asked about this , both Jeff 
Leifer and Marsha Harris, who 

are student members of the search 
committee , said no students have 
lobbied them to consider Hunt 
along with the other applicants. 

"Good job" 
In the Tuesday interview, 

McElroy-who said he thinks Hunt 
is doing a "good job" as Acting 
Vice-chancellor-said if none of the 
search committee's recommended 
candidates for the permanent job 
meet his specifications, he will 
reopen the search process to 
consider new applicants. 

McElroy said the new Vice-
chancellor should be a good ad-
ministrator who can both interact 
with students and competently 
oversee the $5-million student 
affairs budget, which he charac-
terized as "a huge managerial 
job." 

Hunt the campus physical 
education chairman, said last 
week he has had experience 
dealing with budgets in the PE 
department. 

"But I've never had budgetary 
experience on the magnitude of the 
Student Affairs budget," Hunt 
said .

Serious risks 
Fake abortion "facts" refuted 

Ms. Cohan and Ma. Davis (TI, 
Oct. 10, p. 4) seem to be under the 
impression that abortion is 
discussed by discussing the person 
who comments on it. Unfor-
tunately, this tends to avoid the 
issue (mandatory abortion in-
surance land to obscure the facts. 
Ms. Davis alsodoes the women of 

UCSD a disservice by fabricating 
facts to support her views. I would 
like to correct her unfounded 
claim that " the risk of 
sterilization is less than one half of 
one percent. "

Ms. Davis cites as her source "a 
study published in a 1972 issue of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology" by 
Tietze and Lewit. No ~uch study 
exists. 

Tietze and Lewit did not publish 
(or more probably, were not ac-
cepted for publication ) in 
Obstetrics and Gynecology In 1972, 
or in any year between 1969 and 
1976. None of their nine 
publications (Index Medicus) In 
this period appears to report on 
anything beyond "early" com-
plications of abortion. 

Cartoonist underscores 'tragedy 
Because we are high it takes us 

slightly l~er than usual to grasp 
the fact that this man who 
promised to make waves in the 
cesspool of San Diego's cun-
plaCl!ncy has just copped (as in 
pig ~ut on the punk principle cl 
Chaos.) He just pulled an 
authoritarian cheap shot. And 
here we are walking away, beaver 
tails between our legs. 

Even in their latest article 
(Scientific American, Jan., 1977) 
they do not give statistics on 
abortiop induced sterility, 
claiming that this has not been 
"established" . 

This may be true for the United 
States, where unprofessionally 
poor record keeping has charac-
terized abortion practices (e.g. 
exact number provided through 
UCSD insurance is unknown) and 
where long-term. follow up studies 
have been ignored or suppressed.

In her letter (Oct. 17,) Ms, 
Brecha makes some valid points; 
as a 6'1", 190 lb. man I have little

otherwise. 

The closest most men can COOle 
to feeling what she describes in

is, though, one crucial dlfference-

On the other hand, the 
"Boogiemen", in the form of 
rapists, perverts , and muggers, 
that most women are afraid of 
are dismayingly real. It takes 
only a look at the assault and

real.

the political humor behind, and 
the satire in the cartoon. 

Black satire is a form of 
political humor that laughs at the 
tragedies in our society today. 
And it is indeed permissabie, 
even desirable to laugh at 
tragedies such as rape and the 
treatment of the insane (witness 
One F1ew Over TIle Cakoo'. 
Nest). This because the humor 
points up an aspect of the tragedy 
that is amusing, and then after 
the laughter comes the 
awareness of the underlying 
tragedy. 

Yes, it's funny that blowing a 
Rape Whistle brings out hordes of 
rapists glad to accomodate. But it 
is a sad statement that there are 
so many of them out there. 

Ms.. Brecha, your anger is 
misplaced. 

YOID' anger, instead of being 
directed at the cartoon, should be 
directed at a society that allows 
these "sicko creeps" to go free 
and untreated. And you and I are 
part of that society. 

YOID' sorrow ia for the wrong 
reasoo too. It is because society 
doesn't see fit to "oppress" these 
sick people "of viewpoints dif-
fering from the nonn", people 
with viewpoints that say it's O.K. 
to assault someone, to violate a 
person, and that person's rights, 
that this sitUiltion exists. 

And, finally, Stephen Skub-
binna-instead of being in danger 
of strangulation from his narrow 
mind-by calling attention to 
situations like this and others (By 
his use of humor and satire) is 
actually broadening your mind 
and mine.

WHITE PUNKS ON WAVES 

in Council's decision on Black's Beach 
The San Diego City CoWlcil 

literally stripped us of our pants 
when they voted 8-1 to close 
Black's Beacb to nude sunbathing. 

It was the easy way out for such 
members as Councilmen Johnson, 
Morrow, Haro, Strobl and Williams 
to abide by the majority ''man-
date." Is a 15,000 vote difference of 
150,000 people who voted in San 
Diego a large enough difference to 
caD the 'yes' vote 00 Proposition D 
"the will of the people?" Do 16 or 
17-year olds have a say? Do those 
here attending college nine months 
of the year, but whose homes are in 
Los Angeles or San Fran-
cisco' have any say? Do those 
living in surrounding cominunities 
such as La Mesa, El Cajon or 
DelMar have any voice? No, only 
the 18-year old plus population in 
San Diego city limits was eligible 
to decide this issue. 

But then those are the only 
people who vote for the city 
councilmen and the mayor, so the 
elected officials ' did not truly 
represent ''the people's wishes" as 
they aMounced they were dolng-
but rather the minority of eligible 
voters. After all, when only 43 per 
cent of the eligible voters vote, how 
can they ever call Proposition D 
representative of the people? 

Councilwoman Maureen 
O'Connor in casting the lone 
dissenting vote clearly brought up 
the best argument regarding 
representation: Likening it to the 
Panama Canal issue today, the 

American people as a whole, polls 
have shown, do not favor giving the 
canal away." as President Carter 
ia pushing for. Yet, Carter states 
clearly that bis position is In the 
best interests of the American 
people, whether or not they are in 
favor of retaining the canal. And 
he's willing to push it all the way 
through Congress. 

So Comcilwoman o'Connor said 
in effect that it is true we elect 
officials to represent us, but we at 
the same time vote for public of-
ficials to offer us leadership as 
they see in the best Interests of us 
as constituents. H we were allowed 
to vote today whether to pey taxes 
or never have to pay again, one 
does not have to guess the result. 
Who decides what issues we are 
allowed to vote oo? 

Do we really want officeholders 
to be mere puppets attached to us 
by strings of propositions to help 
them operate, or or do we wa.- a 
council that can at times see 
beyond simple "majority 
representation" and act 
courageously to uphold our con-
stitutional rights, personal 
freedoms, etc., and vote hoW they 
perceive the best Interests of not 
only tM electorate, but all the 
people within their jurisdiction, 
and sometimes even beyond. 

After all, Gov. Brown acted on 
his own conscience, and In the best 
publis interest as he perceived it, 
vetoed the capital punishment bill 

in California, even though 213 01. 
this state's cilizenry favor tbe 
death penalty. And his image a half 
year later has not been tarntshed in 
the least. 

Some council members admiUed 
at the historic ~ that they 
feel differently abom Bl8ck's 
Beach being cIo8ed to nude sun-
bathing, btt felt they were cml-
pelled to carry out the 54% to.I, 
'landslide' referendwn. Only one 
member had enough COUfIIge to 
vote her own coOscience. 

FUiany, after the vote, there was 
serious discussion by the coudl to 
develop Black's Beach creating 
pennanent restroom facilities, 
parking lots, lif~ stations, 
and the like. This only makes 
sense when you realize tbat

In anoIber development « tile 
abortion eontroversy 00 campll •• 
gro.., of UCSD studema are 
currently in the procell of fCll'llllng 
what they term, "The Human Life 
Committee." , 

Crmmittee members lblte that 
it was eltabUsbed, ''to promote 
respect for buman life in any and 
all of its pbues." The group ia anti-
abortion but 11'0'" spokesman Don 
Strebel streued, "please don't say 
anti-abortion. We prefer to call 
ourselfves 'Pro life.'. " 

According to Strebel, the group 
was fOWlded to educate the student 
body of the "little known" facts 
concerning the abortion issue. 
Strebel claimed that the com-
mittee's purpose was to educate 
and not to act as an anti-abortion 
lobbying group. 

The group is also, according to 
Strebel, sponsoring an ad-hoc 
committees petition calling for the 
reinstatemett of the three UCSD 
students who were denied 
enrollement tbJI quarter because 
of their refusal to pay reg. fees, a 

portion of whicb are used to su~ 
sidize student a6ortions. 

Other act1vitle. being considered 
by tile COIJU.!llUee include .,n-
soring lectures and a debate on the 
abortion Issue.

HWlt also noted that "The 
amoWlt of money in question 
reqresents only one and one half 
percent of the total budget." 

Bert Lee sees the matter in a 
different light, though, stating, 
"Each student is paying $27.40 UIis 
year for allocations for which there 
was no student input." 

Lee went on to say that this 
represents almost half of the $60 
reg fee increase for 1977-78. 

sexually irresponsible. Once you • 
have this idea of taking riskb with 
pregnancy you encourage people to 
think of pregnancy and abortions 
as events to be taken lighUy." 

Strebel continued, "We are 
creating an ignorance in the 
highest educated class in society. 
In twenty years those in positions 
of power will have attitudes about 
abortioo that are not based on 
fa ct." 

Because of this, he said, "I think 
the committee should assert itself 
at tltis time and recommend the 
freezing of funds until written 
feasibility reports are presented to 
them that meet their satisfaction." 

The issue is far from resolved, 
with another meeting scheduled by 
Reg. Fee this Thursday to further 
discuss the problem. In the 
meantime, the committee has sent 
a letter to Hunt recommending 
that aU funds not already spent be 
frozen.

A tale of three rah-rahs 

by ........ 1Ine)' 
All tboIe peppy. perky girta that 

did elleel'll in htch acbool. . . ~ 
rabin. their way tbrough 
popularity and fun times-but what 
happens after the cbeerJ.eadlng 
eoda? 

Jack Heifner'S drama, 
.. Vaniti .... foclBel 00 the livea rl 
three such girls. giving us an ultra-
cliche, but bigbly entertaining 
glimpse of a little more than ten 
years of their lives. 

Featured downtown at the 
Spreckels Theatre, the play 
commences with Joanne (Kathy 
Glirver), Kathy (Linda Kay 
Henning), and Mary (Eda ZahI) 
prettying themselves before their 
vanity tables. 

As Texas high school seniors, 
their primary concerns Include 
football cheers, plaMing the big 
dat1ce and being popular with the 
boys. A standing joke throughout 
the play is "we need a theme." 
(Le., "We need a theme-why don't 
we make a giant rainbow out of 
chicken wire and stuff it with tissue 
paper?") , 

Head cheerleader Kathy, the 
chief planner for all the activities, 
is often heard uttering the latter to 
"best friends" Joanne aDd 
Mary. All three girlsaeem pretty 
similar 81 they romp through their ' 
featherbrained antics. 
The act ends with an an· 
nouncement of Kennedy's 
assassination which barely seems 
to register to them. 

Time Dies and the girls are 
seniors at a Southern Methodist 
college in the second act. Now 
roommates in a sorority house, the 
three still stick together, and there 
is still the silly chattering-but one 
senses the beginnings of their 
becoming separate young women. 

Joanne wants marriage, 
children and security, while 
sophisticated Mary wants to run 
off to Europe for bedtime fun. Only 
Kathy, the chief organizer, seems 
puzzled and scared about the 
future. Of the three, she is the most 
lost. 

Years later, the women are 
reunited for the ftrst time in 
Kathy's New York apartment. It 

ippeII'II tbat tbe WOIDIIl DOW have 
notIIin8 in COIIIIDGII .. tlley lead 
their lives. JoaDne II a wife and 
motber, Mary runs an erotic art 
gallery and Katby is a liw-In 
mistress. It is witb tbIa breakdown 
in friendIIqJ that the play CO~ 
cludea __ c:b wuman II locked into 
her aep8I'IIt.e life. 

"VlUlities" is aD interesting • 
well .. funny procludion. '!bere's a 
ring of trutb about it that strikes 
something very familiar in our 
pasts, sometblng very identifiable. 

The characters are amlBing to 

watc:b and u-e are 80IDe very 
funny lines. Espedally attncttve 
was the stqin8 ..... t the opening of 
the three acta we lee the adr !I. 18 
in aeparate dr..mg boothia the 
rear rl the stage, dreasing and 
makingap. 

P1aywrite Heifner makes his 
lrmic points well througb the 
nicely cliche cbaracten. Ita the 
play pl"'Ogn.el it is bighly e~ 
tertaining to watch theae three 
"best friends" tranIform into 
separate, incompatible New 
Yorkers.

Abortions .... 
Continued from Page 2 

and childlessness is a serious risk 
of any abortion. 

The medical fa<.1s about the 
consequences of abortion for the 
health of the woman involved and 
her future children (who 
frequently will be born 
prematurely, with a high incidence 
of congenital . defects), argues 
strongly against abortion wtless 
the life of the mother is threatened. 
On what basis, then, has Rick 
Whitehill decided that we must pay 
for some 300 abortions annually as 
a requirement of being a student at 
UCSD?
