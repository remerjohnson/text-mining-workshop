'Wet' Photos Spark ·Protest At UCI 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

Associale News Editor 
Wet t-shirts are driving UC 

rvine crazy. 
At issue are four photographs 

and a story the UCI student 
newspaper ran this week on 
women participating in a wet t-
shirt contest in a bar near the 
Irvine campus. 

The photos, which were 
revealing, if nothing el e , so 
enraged the ASUCI Executive 
Vice-President and twenty-five 
cohorts that they gathered 3,000 
copies of the new University 
and dumped them in the trash . 

As a response to the trashing, 
the new U says it is going to ue 
those responsible for lost 
advertising revenue because of 
dirnini hed circulation for that 

ue . 
Why the Story 

The story, set in the 
Handlebar Saloon in Santa Ana , 
a few minutes from the Irvine 
campus, wa about four 
contestants in the bar's wet t-

shirt contest. The new U story. 
sampled the reaction of the 
audien e, explained how the 
bar conducted the contest and 
interviewed one of the 
contestants, a wet t-shirt 
veteran identified only as 
"Almond Joy." 

new U editor Richard Clucas 
said that he and his staff put 
together the feature because 
"Irvine is a commuter school, 
one with few weekend 
activities ." He and his staff, 
Clucas says, wanted to give the 
campus community an idea of 
w h a t people did during 
weekends at UCI. Presum-
ably, Irvine students either 
participate in or watch the t-
hirt conte ts in th bar. 

Women' Reaction 
Reaction to the tory and 

photo wa fierce. ASUCI 
Executive Vice President 
Karen Bjorneby and "25 other 
students," according to 
Bjorneby .. 'spontaneo Iy 

gathered the papers and threw 
them in the trashcan as a 
symbolic act against the new 
University . " 

Bjorneby said she and her 
fellow trashers weren't trying 
to deprive the Irvine' com-
munity of a newspaper (she 
argues there were still 8,000 
copies left on campus) , but 
instead were prote ting as part 
of a " groundswell of opinion" 
against the paper. 

" The arti 'I ' . " Bjorn 'by 
claims, "set the woman 's 
·movement back twenty years . 
The author debased women , 
and the new Univer ity has 
consistently avoided women ' 
is ues ." 

new U Reaction 
Although the pap r re 0 -

Bjorneb and company threw 
away, Clucas and new U

first time he left h e wus

return for this fuvor he hus 
since ullowed the country's 
naturul resources to be dri.lined 
by the U .S. and other 
imperiulist governments. while 
he hus supported the American 
military industrial complex 
through massive purchase of 
U.S. arms: and this is .1 country 
where poverty and deprivation 
are rampanl. The Shah has 
spent $36 billion on arm s and

there <.ire only 3.000 physicians 
serving 36 million people. and 
the country ha ' an iIIitracy rate

roads , where there should be 
50.000. 

The Shah's offenses ugainst 
the Iranian peoJ)le do not begin

Pahlavi reign. the humun 
rights of the people huve been 
withheld, freedom of press, 
freedom of religious worship, 
freedom of speech, all were

West is a str.mge name for a 
hou ing development , to be 
located just north of cumpus 
and east of 1-5. Some may 
dismiss any intere t in such a 
development : uCter all. 
Southcrn ali fornia sprouts 
them so quickly they seem to be 
an act of God. But North City 
West is Illore than just another 
conglomcri.ltion of cubicles. 
like those that forest the 
landscape of L.A . As the name 
informs, it is a city! In facl a 
city proposed to accommodate 
40.000 people. (That is eight 
times the population o[ Del 
Mar. ) 

The Ci ty of San Diego, in it's 
infinite wisdom. hus cla ~ si[ied 
this rolling chaparral territory 
in the "u rbanizing ca tegory." 
They validly point out that San 
Diego's large 'influx of 
popukltion must be accom-
11l0d:lted some how . U nfor-
tunately current estimutes of 
the average urth City West 
home will place the cost at 
abou t $100,000. This means, 
according to the L.A . Times, 
that the home-owner must have 
un average income of $42,000 . It 
is debuta ble whether such 
individuals wi ll be satisfied to 
be crammed in to such a 
"community ." Everything, 

down to the types of foliage and 
street signs, has been specified 
for the development. Although 
an entertaining exercise [or 
civi l engineers, the whole cene 
reak of artifi ciality. 

Here ar e several other points 
to consider about No rth City 
West and it's impact on the 
area: I) It will help de-
centralize the City of San Diego 
( I sn't one Lus Angeles 
enough?): 2) Po llution (a ll 
kinds) : 3) Increused beach 
usage: 4) Raise Del Mar Laxes 
(accordi ng to Del Mar Mayor 
Sweetwater): 5) Crime: and 
finally 6) High home-owner 
transition rate. 

In <.'0 nelusion. I present an 
appea l to the student body and 
facu Ity of U San Diego. If you 
feel an attachment to uur 
surrounding beuuty and wish to 
be instrumental in presel'\' ing 
it. utilize your political 
leverage, Help oppose the 
mega-buck interests who are 
shoving North City West down 
our throats. Make the San

NASA 'Recycles' Space Technology 
By [~ul Campion 

Science Editor 
NASA (National Aeronautics 

and Space Administration) has 
been working Cor the past 16 
years to "recycle" the 
technology of aeronautics 
research. The results of this 
effort . what NASA calls 
"technologies twice used, " 
range Crom better sounding 
guitars to improved hospital 
patient monitoring systems, 
according to a recent report by 

5Pt1YT NIGHT 

the admini trution . C<.llled 
SpinoU. 

Several ycur ugo. engineers 
working for NASA developed u 
helicopter rotor system with 
reduced v;brution und, 
correspondingly , greuter 
ecriciency. Encouraged by the 
Technology Utilization Pro-
gr<.lm - the force behind the 
"recycling" - the scienti ts 
reexamined their resea rch 
with an eye towurd other 
possible applications.

Realizing thut a design which 
mhibits vibr,ltion must be 
closely related to one which 
enh'.lnces vibrution. Charles 
Kaman . president of the 
corpor:llion contracted to do 
the rese.lrch, used the rotor 
engineering to design a new 
style of guitar. The result. 
ca lled the Ovation guitar. is 
l! nique in that it hus a rounded 
back. This slight departure 
from the norm improves the 
sound of the instl'ument so 
greatly that in a relatively 
short time it has become 
preferred by many J)Crformel·s. 

A more direct second use of 
technology comes from the 
space program . Apollo 
astronauts places several very 
sensitive seismic detectors on 
the surface of the moon. The 
data received from these 
instruments can be used to 
determine such characteristics 
as the thi ckness and density of 
the satellite. 

Back on Earth , another 
shock-sensitive apparat us, 
very si milar to that used in the 
lunar study. has been designed 
for use in the home and in 
businesses to detect the motion 
of intruders. The device can be 
set to monitor motion up to 260 
feet from where it is situated. 

adapted so as to be usefu l in 
alerting miners of possible 
danger in the depths of a coal 
mine . Also. a I'adi<.ltion hazUI'd 
detector engint.'Cred through 
space research is currently 
used in some industries to 
determine the relulive safety of 
areas in which employees could 
be exposed to microwaves . 

In hospita ls . putients ' heart 
rates. blood pressures and 
other vita I signs can be 
measurcd conswntly through a 
process culled telemetry . 
Originully designed to send 
data about the physica l 
condition of astronauts back to 
Earth , telemetry utilizes only u 
few electricla leuds, connected 
to the patient's arm or chest. 

running to i.I small tnlllsmitter 
box which could be worn at the 
waist. Without the wi I'e 
connections prcviou s ly so 
cumbersome. signals can be 
sent directly from the 
transmitter to i.l monitoring 
system at a centra l nurse' 
s tation . 

Among the many othcr 
second -hand development 
claimed by NASA to be a result 
o( aeronautics resea rch are : 
Sound Guard " record preser-
vution kits." improved food 
packiJging. computer en -

It doesn·t really matter to me 

if Pitt burgh or Dallas wins the 
Super B wI. What really 
matters i whether or not my 
number comes u p in the big $100 
Super Bowl pool. 

So what if this could be the 
most exciting Super Bowl in 
years. On Sunday at 1 pm my 
TV will be tuned to Channel 39 
to see if I can make some big 
bucks off of Super Bowl XIII . 

Millions of Americans will 
have a little money riding on 
the outcome of this sports 
spectacle. It isn 't a maller of 
win or lose. but if your team can 
beat the spread. The official 
Las Vegas spread for Sunda 's 
game in Miami fuvors the 
Pittsburgh Steeler by 3 point . 

However , a lot of smart 
money is going down on the 
Dallu owboys, The teeler ' 

may have "Mean" Joe Green' 
on defense, but the Cowboy 
have mean Harvey Martin. 
mean Randy White. meun Tom 
" Hollywood" Hendel' on und 
extremely mean Ed " TooTall " 
Jones. Anywuy you figure it. 
that ' s a whole bunch of 
meannes , 

The Steeler oCCense won't be 
running scared, though. They'lI 
probably be running up the 
middle wifh their superstur 
power back Franco Harris. The 
Steeler uren't afraid to throw 
the bull either. Quarterback 
Terry Brudshaw is blessed with 
two of the game' finest 
receivers, John Stallworth and 
Lynn Swan. 

The Cowboys are no slouche 
when it comes to offen e. 
Ru nning buck Tony Dol' et t can 
be extremely dungerou ' if he 
gets to th 'out ide, and it will be 
the job of Pitt burgh's talented 

linebackers (the Jack boys, 
11am und Lambel·t) to contain 
him. 

If the Steelers contain the 
Cowboy running game. look for 
Dalla to go to the air with their 
patented (or ut least. putent 
pending) shotgun offense. The 
cl'ufty Cowboy quarterbuck 
Roger Stuubuck has a wide 
as ortment of receivers and 
backs to throw to. 

Roger the Dodger 
There is still some concern 

ver the health of Staubach , 
During the first round playoff 
game again t Atlanta. the 
former Heisman trophy winner 
from the Naval Academy was 
knocked unconsciousness and 
was forced to leave the game 
with a concussion. When he 
came to. Staubach want.ed to 
know if they (meaning avy) 
were beating Army. Stuubilch

Best of New Wave . Rock for 1978 
By, Mikel Toombs 

After too little excitement 
and too much sleep, I've come 
to the conclusion that the 
passing year wasn' t such a 
good one after all . musically 
peaking. True. there arc 

indications that ro k and 1'011 
wilil'eturn to the unpretentious 
intensity of the mid-Fifties and 
Sixties (when we could feel 
rock and roll still had some 
potency) . but the outlook for the 
not-so-diswnt future is dismal. 
Here is my arbitrary list of the 
best musical products of the 
year.

Dire Straits 
By William Gibson 

Well, another proof thut banality has 
a large part in eclecticism (or should 
that be vice versa?) has arrived on the 
pop music scene in the form of a band 
and album called Dire Straits. The five 
musicians are British , but the music 
they play is generically American. 
The superb leCld guitar work is by 
Mm'k Knopf/er. who pluys with a touch 
remini cent of J .J. Cale: he plays. in 
other words , like Eric Clapton would 
like to play. His guitClr weeps. it 
dances and sings and more - itsounds

R_~gent Meeting 

(Continu('d from page I ) 
The resolution will be 

considered again next 
Tuesday, but Clucas says that if 
it passes, he will refuse to run 
an apology. Since the AS 
contributes $21,000 to the new 
U, about two-fifths of the 
newspaper's budget, Clucas 
and the new U are responsible 
to the ASUCI Council, but 
Clucas said it was "unlikely" 
the ASUCI will cease support of 
the paper or fire him. 

The ASUCI has decided to 
fund an alternative publication, 
to be called the " Real 

University," for at least next 
week. The new paper, to which 
the ASUCI has given $500, is 
expected to be devoted for the 
most part to " women's issues" 
and a response to the new V's 
wet t-shirt story.

Interestingly, the one female 

new V executive editor ,

What finally happens at

and what action the ASUCI 
Council decides to take. 

It is fairly certain, though, 
that the controversial

in the new U photo contest, 
advertised on the back page of 
the very same issue.

previously unre leased in -
strumenwl material under the 
title Music For Film . The 
prodUction is of course 
impeccable , th e music 
extremely evocati\'e, brotldly 
ranged. The a lbum' short cuts 
provide a wide sumple of the 
nu a nces, emoti ona l tlnd 
musical, of the only pop arti t 
who can, in my opinion, lay 
even a weak claim to being u 
progenitive musical a rtist. 
Well worth the pri ce. 

In addition to thes :! semi-
arcane elections we have Of

somewhat I'eminiscent of 
Frank Zappa t hough not so 
jaded 01' as tightly constructed. 
Thei I' advantage over U. K. (the 
inevitable compi.1rison) .is th at 
their lyrics are not so selr-
conscious, (e.g., we don' t have 
to listen to John Welton 
mOLlning .. go-wing no-where" ) , 
nor their music so cl iehed. Now

A Approves Sunday Coast Cruiser

New Sund y r ns oflheCoast 

Gruiser fun ed by the AS and 
two other measures were 
approved by the AS during their 
meeting last Wednesday before 
it ended when councilman Jim 
Atkins left, breaking quorum. 

The AS passed Student 
Advocate Barry Hyman' 
proposal to ptovide $753.84 to 
finance a Sunday run of the 
'Coast Cruiser through the rest 
of this year. The Crui er, which 
shuttle tudent between the 
campus and North ounty , 
currently operutes runs at 8. 9. 
and 10 pm, Monday through 

Thursday. Fare for the new 
Sunday run , oJ)en to all 
students, will be the usual 25¢. 

The AS also voted to support 
Hyman's motion to finance a 
political film series by the 
Committee for World Democ-
racy with AS unallocated fund . 
A representative from the 
organization said the film 
eries could have begun last 

quarter, but that they were 
denied fund by the Student 
Activity Board for allegedly 
" J)olili cal reation ." A similar 
film eries 14.1 t year. the 
reJ)resenwtive aid. averaged 
125 students per movie. 

Debate over whether to 

charge admis ion to thc AS 
Spirit Night Dance aturday 
night became long and heated 
after Commis ioner JimAtkins 
pointed out it will conflict with a 
fund raising d.mce by the Asian 
American Student Alliance 
(AASA). i.ll 0 funded by the AS. 
Confusion over how the conflict 
occurred lead to debate 
whether the AS would be 
stealing the AASA's crowd if 
the Spirit Night Dance waS held 
free as J)lanned. A compromi e 
was reached whereby thc AS 
will match the AASA's 
admission pricc of $1.50 and 
give their profit to the AASA 
hould they 10 c money. 
The dance decision wa ' the 

last action taken by the ouncH 
as ten minutes later, while the 
rest of the A debated the 
details of hi presentation of 
Student Organizi.ltion budget 
requests. Jim Atkin' walked 
out. breaking quorum. Atkins 
wa' immediately followed by 
councilman Sung Choe from 
Third ollege. ending any nope 
the meeting could continue. 

nion's TGIF. against Atkins ' 
wishes as head of the Activity 
Fee Committee. when Jon 
Bekken. of the Progressive 

oalition . began his budget 
rcque t presentution. At this 
point Atkins left. Contacted 
soon alterwards. Atkin 
refused to talk to the (;uardian. 
saying " I want to go home. I 
have better things to do." 

AS President John Jenkel 
wi II use his opJ)ortunity funds to 
support the Black Students 
Union. Surf Club. and CSU 
activitics left in the lerch when 
the quorum broke. Carberrv 
sa id the Presidents' account 
will be reimbursed at next 
week 's coulH:il meeting whcn 
the Budget bill should J)ass. 

Parking Problems Continue 
Despite Increasing Fees 

AS Vice-President A.nn 
Carberry ' repei.ltedly askcd 
Nkins to retul"n to his chi.lir. 
reminding him of the number 
present. as Atkins headed for 
the door. Atkin said nothing as 
he left. while Carberry . in 
frustl'i.ltion. hurled an epithet 
at him . Carbcrry l atcr 
explained her angel' ·uying. "in 
politi ·1.11 di 'agrecments you 
don ' t make you!' point by 
breaking quorum, that 's OJ 
cheap ' hot. " 

arberry feel that Atkins 
broke quorum beeause he 
wasn't "getting his way" on his 
budget pre cntation. Th' A 
had alt· ady decided to fund the 
Communications tud nt

"It· unfair that I had to pa 
$42.00 for a parking permit and 
['m still unable to find a 
parking spot when I need one," 
complains on C D student. 
This i not an unusual gripe. 
according to Van Jalmcs -
Smith. acting manager of 
U D ' parking services 
office. 

He receive 5 to 10 ' U 'h 
comp laints PCI' day . The 
problem occurs . eXJ)lained 
Jahnes-Smith. not b 'cau 'e they 
oversell the parking lot 
capacities by 15'1, . but becau e 
many spaces are actua ll y 
never utilized. 
.- Jahne -Smith explained that 
the parking lots c:Ios "t to the 
bu iest ections of 'D 
(Revelle and Muir c4lmpuse ' ) 
fill up quickly. tudcntscoming 
in later than 9: 30 a. m. often 
earch the Rc"cll' and Muir 

lots in vain ror ·paccs. 

Whilc thcse lots are u ually 
rull ~Ifter 9: 30 . however. there is 
often spac' in parking lots 
yards away. Le ser-known 
parking lot . ' ueh as the one 
behind the SO Medical 
Sehool and the lot off M il'amar 
road . arc notoriously under-

The parking office advises 
that in tead of wa ting time 
attempting to find parking in 
the overcrowded Rev~1I and 
Muir lot . tudent drive
