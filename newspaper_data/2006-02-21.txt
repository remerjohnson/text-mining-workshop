Report: Over One Million 
Students Miss Out. On Aid 
Low-income students 
eligible for Pell Grants 
but who do not turn 
in required forms a 
growing problem. 

By Matthew McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

Almost 1.5 million students eli-
gible for fmancial aid in the form of 
federal Pell Grants did not receive aid 
during the 2003-
04 academic year 
because they did 
not apply for 
it, adding to a 
growing trend, 
according to a 
new report by 
the American 
Council on 
Education. 

The number 
of eligible stu-
dents who do not 
apply for fman-
cial aid has risen 
steadily since 
the 1999-2000 
academic year, 
when 850,000 
eligible students 
did not fill out a 
Free Application for Federal Student 
Aid, required by the federal govern-
ment to determine aid eligibility. 

Despite an overall increase in 
FAFSA submissions since then, the 
number of low- and middle-income 
students that met requirements to 
receive aid but who neglected to sub-
mit a FAFSA has grown substantially, 
the report said. 

UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Vincent De Anda said that while 
national figures have demonstrated a 
dip in financial aid requests, UCSD 
continues to receive more and more 
FAFSAs each year. Last year, the uni-
versity processed nearly 24,()()() appli-
cations for aid, and about 13,000 of 
those requests were approved, bring-
ing the total amount of money award-
ed to UCSD students to about 5227 
million, according to De Anda. 

"The total amount [of aid] has 
steadily in~reased each year," he stated 
in an e-mail. 

The ,A.C.E. report examined the 
rates at which undergraduates did not 
complete a FAFSA and analyzed char-
acteristics of those students in terms 
of dependency status, income, atten-
dance status and institution type. It 
also estimated the share of nonfilers 
who may have been eligible for a Pell 
Grant. 

"While we are pleased to see more 
students from the general popula-
tion apply for aid, it is disappoint-
ing that students who could benefit 
the most from financial aid are not 
making progress and are actually los-
ing ground," Jacqueline E. King, the 
director of A.C.n Center for Policy 
Analysis, s~ in the report. "This 

OPINION 

is the time of .year when financial aid 
applications if. due and we want to 
encourage stua;nts and their families 
to complete t AFSA:' 

The repo also found a 4-per-
cent decrease since 1999-2000 in the 
number of low, income independent 
students who ctid not file a FAFSA, 
and found that more than one-third 
of those who di,f not apply were full-
time students. 

Results from the report also show 
that 55 percent of students at com-
munity colleges did not apply for aid, 

compared to 37 
percent of stu-
dents attending 
public four-year 
institutions, 27 
percent of stu-
dents at private 
nonprofit four-
year colleges and 
13 percent of stu-
dents at private 
for-profit institu-
tions. 

The number 
of non applicants 
who seem to 
be Pell Grant-
eligible grew 
because both col-
lege enrollments 
and the overall 
number of stu-

dents submitting a FAFSA increased, 
and because an $800 increase in the 
maximum Pell Grant allowed more 
students to qualify for the program, 
according to the report.

Athletic Funds Fall Into the Red 

GREG DALE/GUARDIAN 
The UCSD athletics department is nearly $275,000 in debt since moving from NCAA Division III to Division II as a result of additional 
NCAA requirements, increased schedule and travel costs, budget reductions and a lack of revenue.

'severe' level of

The deficit in the department's 
operating budget is now considered 
severe after the department reported 
falling apprOximately $275,000 in 
the red during the 2004-05 fiscal 
year, according to Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph w. Watson.

cost for a particular program varies 
with a number of factors ... schedule

mix of teams, local co t of living, etc:' 

Watson al 0 said that addi-

reductions, lack of inflation adjust-

WinterFest Attendance Hits 
Lowest Point In Three Years 

Attendees leave early 
because of long delay 
before rapper Redmans 
act. Low numbers add to 
growing trend. 

By Jadyn Snow 
STAFF WRITER 

The A.S. programming office has seen 
years of decline in WinterFest attendance, 
with the latest concert - featuring rapper 
Redman and indie artist Jack's Mannequin 
- hitting its lowest number in three years. 

The concert had a turnout of about 2,400 
students, according to A.S. Commissioner 
of Programming Eric Morris. Last year, with 
performers SociaJ Distortion, Backyard 
Babies and KRS-One, the programming 
office, which is funded by student activ-
ity fees, saw only a slightly better turn-
out, Morris said. Winter Fest in 2004, with 
Switchfoot, Talib Kweli and Louis XIV had 
more than 6,000 in attendance. 

"[Last year] was slightly higher prob-
ably by 300 or 400 people," Morris said. 

"WinterFest is generally lower attended 
then all the festivals; for whatever reason, 
winter quarter just doesn't draw as weB:' 

The main draw for the programming 
office has been the Sun God Festival, which 
usually features mainstream and well-known 
artists. But the musical acts at this year's 
Winter Fest, especially Redman, left much 
to be desired, according to Earn Warren 
College sophomore Nick Norton. 

"Redman is seriously terrible and every-
one knows that," he said. "With 20,000 
people, there's no way you're going to find a 
band everyone likes." 

A long delay between acts encouraged 
many concert attendees to leave. Although 
Revelle College sophomore John Wu 
enjoyed the first part of the concert, he 
said he left, along with over half the crowd, 
before Redman's set because of the wait. 

"We were tired and bored because it 
took so long for [Redman] to come out," 
Wu said. "I would have stayed if it didn't 
take forever," 

Delays have long been a tradition for 
hip-hop acts at the programming office's

Alzheimer's Study 

A new landmark Alzheimer's 
disease study that will allow UCSD 
researchers to exami ne brain and 
other biologica l changes associat-
ed with memory decli ne has been 
authorized by the Nationa l Institute 
on Aging. 

The five-year. $60 million study 
will give researchers the opportunity 
to speed up the search for treatments 
and cures for Alzheimer's disease by 
seeing whether imaging of the brai n 
ca n help predict and monitor the 
onset and progression of the degen-
erative memory disease. 

The study, spearheaded by Leon 
Thai, chair of the UCSD neurosci-
ences department a nd director of 
UCSD's Shiley-Marcos Al zheimer's 
Disease Research Center, will also 
col lect and test patient blood sam-
ples and cerebral spinal fluid to 
determine if they can help predict 
and monitor the onset of the dis-
ease. 

Researchers hope that imag-
ing techniques will prove useful 
in testing the effectiveness of new 
therapies that try to slow the pro-
gression of Alzheimer's or prevent 
it altogether. 

Clerical Employees 
Sign New Contract 
The UC Clerical Employees' 

Union agreed to a new multiyear 
contract with the university last 
week, which gives clerical employ-
ees a 12-percent wage increase over 
the next th ree years. 

The agreement, valid t~rough 
September 2008, a lso allows UC 
clerical e mployees to continue to 
receive the same hea lth benefits 
given to a ll UC employees and 
leaves in place the univelsity's sal-
ary-based approach to health care 
premiums that lets those who earn 
less pay less for the same health 
coverage. The new contract a lso 
prohibits the union from conduct-
ing any strikes, including sympathy 
walkouts, for the duration of the 
agreement. 

Mousie Model Helps 
Drug Production 

Resea rchers from the UCSD 
Schoo l of Medi ci ne have devel-
oped a mouse model tha t could 
help scientists develop better drugs 
for autoimmune diseases like mul-
tiple sclerosis and rheumatoid 
arthritis. 

UCSD professor of medicine 
Mark H. Ginsburg served as team 
leader of the study. His team iden-
tified a mechanism in mice to 
selectively disrupt signaling . cells 
called lymphocytes sent by the 
body to to fight infection at sites 
of inflammation: while also main-
taining the body's other essential 
immune system fu nctions. 

The resea rchers suggest that 
mice are valuable tools to test 
models of inflammatory and auto-
immune diseases of humans, and 
that a new class of pharmaceutical 
agents that target the interac tion 
of surface molecules found on the 
exterior of cells could be important 
in finding future treatments for 
inflammatory disease.

Lack of Research Dooms Low-Income Students 
~ AID, from page 1 

According to the report, however, 
little new information is available 
on the reasons why students do not 
apply for aid. 

Twenty-nine percent of students 
who did not file a FAFSA received 
aid from programs that did not 
require the application - such as 
employer assistance (13 percent), 
institutional non -need -ba ed aid 
(6 percent) and privale grants and 
loans (5 percent). For orne stu · 
dents, this aid may have eliminated 
the need for fu rther assistance, the 
report suggested. 

De Anda indicated that although 
there is no est imate on the number 
of eligible UCSD students who do 
not submit a FAFSA, the problem 
lies in the fact that most low-income 

students do not spend enough time 
researching aid possibilities. 

"Low-income people sometimes 
disqualify themselves before doing 

1 we don't do 
enough pure 
financial-aid 
outreach?' 

- Vincent De Anda, 
Director, UCSD Financial Aid 

the research:' he stated in an e-mail. 
"They just don't believe it is pos-
sible:' 

De Anda also said that UCSD 

tries to help students apply for fman-
cial-aid through numerous programs, 
including trips to high schools and 
community coUeges, coUege nights, 
special financial-aid workshops and 
counselor conferences. He also said 
that UCSD participates in every 
fmancial-aid program for which it 
is eligible, including Cal Grants and 
federal Supplemental Opportunity 
Grants. However, he said that more 
financial aid outreach programs are 
needed. 

"During peak periods, like right 
now, we cannot meet aU the requests 
for financial aid workshops;' De Anda 
stated. "I feel we don't do enough 
pure financial-aid outreach:'

Delays Common With Hip-Hop Artists 
~ CONCERT, from page 1 
concerts, specifically with Ludacris' 
and Busta Rhymes' performances 
at the past two Sun Gods, accord-
ing to Morris. 

"Notoriously with hip-hop art-
ists, they are a little slow getti ng on 
stage - we have seen [thisl with 
just about every hip-hop act we've 
had," he said. 

The need to change musical sets 
usually calls for a 20- minute wait, 
but Redman extended the delay at 
this year's Winter Fest, Morris said. 

The programming office would 
not comment on the reason why 
the wait between acts was longer 

than usual. 
With only approximately 10 

percent of UCSD's undergraduates 
attending WinterFest, Morris said 
he is still pleased with the out-
come. 

"I believe the all the performers 
played very well," he said . "I think 
we put on the best show we could 
given the circumstances. I think it 
was money well spent." 

This year, WinterFest cost each 
undergraduate about $2.50. accord-
ing to Morris. The A.S. program-
ming office is in position to receive 
more funding with a referendum 
that would increase activi ty fees by 

$8 per quarter. 
"Money is obviously a big thing 

in putting on concerts," Morris 
said. "The more you have, the big-
ger and better thi ngs can get. We 
could do some great th ings with 
that." 

John Muir College junior Grace 
Wang hopes that the increase can 
get students more excited about 
events and bring in better bands. 

But a for this WinterFest: "I 
don't know who Redman or Jack's 
Mannequin is;' Wang said.

Watson to Bolster Dept. 
With Temporary Funds 
~ ATHLOICS, from page 1 

The NCAA and CCAA charge 
regular and postseason travel costs, 
conference dues, regulatory compli-
ance and reporting costs, along with 
the recent requirement mandating 
athletic scholarships - the motiva-
tion behind Watson's grant -in-aid 
proposal. which would give each stu-
dent athlete a $500 scholarship. The 
proposal is currently under Academic 
Senate review. 

Both the student affairs and athlet-
ics departments also admit that UCSD 
intercollegiate athletics began as an 
underfunded Division-Ill program 
and, in spite of budget increases, the 
challenge is stiU very evident at the 
Division-II level. Due to initially inad-
equate revenues for the ize and nature 
of UCSD's program, the cost adjust-
ments for inflation did not keep up 
with the increased expenses the depa rt-
ment faced , according to Watson. 

The athletics department has a 
$2.6 million budget for 23 sports, 
whereas other Division- II schools 
average $2.3 million for 13 sports, 
according to Director of Athletics 
Earl W. Edwards. 

While athletic programs have 
been functioning minimally within 
financial constraints, budget cuts 
have caused even more problems for 
the department. In Ihe 2003-04 fiscal 
year, state funding of registration-fee 
supported services - such as athlet-
ics - dropped by 20 percent. 

"Several offices with the potential 
to raise gift funds, including [athlet-
ics]. were assigned 30-percent budget 
reductions in order to minimize bud-
get [cutsl on other student services; 
Watson said. 

That year brought a one-time cut 
of $200.000 to the department, on top 
of the $300,000 in requi red annual 
NCAA fees. 

"It obviously impacted u quite a 

bit in the negative way in terms of 
what we could and could not do;' 
Edwards said. 

Insufficient funds also mean less 
competitive sports team , according 
to Edwards. 

· We don't have the fu nding to 
play all the teams in the confe rence;' 
Edwards said . "UCSD teams have 
10 raise their own money to play 
the top-ranked teams. If they don't 
play those teams. Ihere is a stronger 
possibility not to be selected [for I 
post eason." _ 

The athletic department' deb I 
also results in lower staff and coach-
ing alaries co mpared to. UCSD's 
Division-II counterpart, according 
to Associate Director of Athletics 
Ken Grosse. 

"University taff [members] are 
your best salespeople;' Grosse said. 
"The people that should be your best 
salespeople are becoming negatives 
instead of positives and that lack of 
passion ~,mong the staff permeates to 
students. 

Along with the impact to uni-
versity staff, the debt also affects 
students, funneling funds away 
from other student-life activities, 
which are also funded by the stu-
dent affairs office, according to A.S. 
President Chri stopher Sweeten. 
Nevertheles, Watson said that 
the student affairs department has 
committed to providing athletics 
with temporary funds fo r the 2005 
and 2006 fiscal years in order to 
avoid budget reductions Ihat would 
adversely affect athletes or program 
competitiveness. 

In addition, a program review will 
be conducted this year that will pro-
vide several options for a long-term 
solution to the deficit .

HowUCSD's 
Own 'Bridge to 
Nowhere'Went 

Unnoticed 
A fter Hurricane Katrina hit last fall, the "bridge to nowhere" 

- a special pork project 
inserted into a federal bill that would 
have paid hundreds of millions for a 
bridge connecting two unpopulated 
areas in Alaska - became the focus 
of national ridicule. A year earlier, 
though, no one gave a damn about 
UC O's own bridge to nowhere, a 
project thai became a black hole 
for millions of dollars of taxpayers' 
money. 

Hats 
Off 

Vladimir Kogan 
vko gan@ucsd .edu 

In early August 2004 , the uni· 
versity sent out a little·noticed press 
release, "UCSD To Discontinue 
Campus Bridge Project; elCplaining 
that it wa scrapping the construc-
tion of a bridge connecting east 
and west campus because of ris-
ing construction costs and budget 
hortfalls. In the previous six years. 

UCSO blew $7.4 million - $3.3 
million of its own money, and the 
res t from the state and federal gov-
ernment - on the bridge that never 
came to be. 

But the story of the 1-5 Advanced 
Tech nology Bridge Project is not 
imply an amUSing anecdote in the 

annals of UCSO history; it shows 
how self-interested lawmakers use 
so·called "earmarks" to waste bil· 
lions on pet projects at their favorite 
universitie , even as they cut billions 
from student loans and financial aid. 

Every year. Congress approves 
bills with thousands of special provi-
ions that provide funding for local 

programs - projects too inefficient 
or useless to qualify for federal fund· 
ing under normal allocation pro· 
cesses. Alaska's bridge was one such 
project, funded by a special provision 
attached by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Ala.) 
to a 2005 federal highway bill. And 
so was UCSD's bridge, funded by a 
special provision anached by Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (O-Calif.) to a 1998 
federal highway bill. 

The difference, though , is that 
Stevens became the subject of jokes 
on late-night tall< shows, while Boxer 
was seen as a local hero. 

In 1998, shortly after "bringing 
home the pork; Boxer staged a press 
conference on campus, annoUJlcing 
proudly, "We are entering a new era 
of bridge building. This project will 
be a national model:' 

Nor was Boxer shy about her 
role in gening the $6 million in fed · 
eral funds, as a press release put out 
by her office proudly explained that 
"Boxer was instrumental in ensuring 
both authorization and funding for 
th is bridge:' 

Whatever the virtues of a bridge 
to connect two sides of a university 
campus - I would argue the gov· 
ernment has better uses for the $6 
million, like feeding the hungry and 
providing health insurance for the 
poor - it was never built, even as 
the university spent millions on the 
project. 

UCSD, of cou rse, argues that the 
bridge program was surely worth-
while, since it provided ground.

Disposable Athletes 
. lifo Ajler the Podium Is 

Competition -minded 
countries push young 
athletes to peak early, 
stunting crucial 
development in other 
areas of their lives, 

By Megan Durham 
STAFF WRITER 

Children as young as five wak-ing up at six and taking part in grueling training exercises 
to make them Olympic champions. 
Scouts in elementary schools across 
the country measuring children to 
see how they will develop and send-
ing the most likely prospects into 
athletic schools, whether or not they 
show interest. A state determined 
to win OlympiC medals, so much 
so that they disregard the educa-
tion and emotional health of their 
elite athletes. Four-time rowing gold 
medalist Matthew Pinsent's recent 
visit to, and subsequent condemna-
tion of, China's elite sport school 
Shi Cha Hai alerted many to the 
presence of these scenarios in the 
Chinese sport system. 

His remarks to the BBC have 
sparked a debate about China's win-
ning bid for the 2008 Olympics, 
but this debate raises issues that 
resound across the world of sports, 

All Downhill 

issues that concern how children 
become athletes, how athletes are 
trained, and whether they ignore 
their future in order to excel at their 
chosen sports. 

It does seem atrocious to force 
children into a sport, but that habit 
is not limited to the Chinese. It 
occurs in the United States all too 
often, only instead of through a gov-
ernment program, it is overzealous 
parents determined to have their 

have won Olympic gold in all-round 
rhythmic gymnastics since 1976, 
two were 15, one was 16, one was 17 
and two were 19. As Istvan BaIvi of 
the National Coaching Lnstitute of 
British Columbia insists, if it takes 
10 years to produce an elite athlete, 
and the Olympic peak age is in Late 
adolescence, then in order to be 
competitive athletes are forced to 
start early in life. 

This means that athletes enter 
the sporting world 

before they have 
children become 
Olympians. Just 
look at how speed 
skating gold med· 
alist Shani Davis 
got started, with 
his mother, Cherie, 
taking him to skat· 
ing rinks at two· 
and·a·half years 
old and giving him 
quarters for skat· 
ing as fast as he 
could. waking him 
up before school 

if an athlete is 
u enough to win 

had a chance to 
experience life 
outside of it. Add 
to this the fact 
that the American 
sports establish-
ment barely pre-
pares athletes for 
life after their 
sport, and you've 
got a recipe for 
misery. Even if 

large sponsorships, 
one day the fans will 
stop screaming, and 
the dream will end" 

every day to run a.mile, and signing 
him up for intensive classes when he 
was only six. 

"It's easy for him because I do the 
work; she told the Denver Post. 

Athletes start just as early here 
as they do in China, espeCially in 
sports that have young peak ages 
such as gymnastics or figure kating, 
two of the most popular Olympic 
events. Of the eight women who 

an athlete is Lucky 
enough to win large sponsorships, 
one day the fans will stop scream-
ing, the cameras will stop flashing. 
and the dream will end. Psychology 
Today reports that "those at greatest 
risk of post-retirement letdown are 
the athletes who dominate their pro-
fession, who know nothing of failure 
and everything of success." These are 
the athletes who are least prepared to 
cope with the day-to-day clutter and 

JENNIFER HSUfCU>lRDI>lN 

problems of the real world. 
This is especially true in sports, 

like gymnastics, that start at a very 
early age. Children that have been 
sport· focused their entire lives have 
never really learned to interact with 
others. Instead they have been incu-
bated in a world of adults - coach-
es, trainers and nutritionists - or 
at best, other children who are as 
goal-oriented as they are. And with-
out the usual interaction with their 
peers, their emotional development 
falters, leaving them less able to deal 
with life after their sport ends. 

"Because they've been so focused 
on sports from an early age, many 
athletes never develop necessary 
parts of the self,' observes Cristina 
Versari, head of sports psychology at 
San Diego University for lntegrative 
Studies, in Psychology Today. 
"There's a developmental arrest." 

But it's more than just dealing 
with the real world - once some-
one leaves a sport they have spent 
their entire life training for, they 
rarely are qualified to do anything 
else. For every gold medalist there 
are silver and bronze medalists, ath-
letes almost as good but who seldom 
receive the lucrative sponsorships 
or rewards that come with the gold. 
It is the lucky ones who plan ahead 
and work at their educations at the 
same time they work on their hand-

Athletic Competition Leaves 
Many Without Life Skills 

• ATHLETES, from page 4 
springs. 

Only recently has the ath-
letic community started to grasp 
this problem. A forum of the 
International Olympic Commission 
recently issued a recommendation 
that athletes seriously consider life 
after their sports. It suggested that 
athletes not only use the opportuni-
ties given to them to network and 
manage their money, but that they 
should also consider gening an edu-
cation while in pursuit of the gold. 

These seem like very common-
sense ideas, but when one is caught 
up in the fast-paced world of sports 
it is easy to forget about anything 
but your athletic career and friner 
your earnings away. Look at former 
baseball star J.R. Richard, found 
living under a bridge or world-class 
sprinter Huston McTear. homeless 
in Sweden. 

But it isn't enough to simply 
make recommendations. The ath-
letic community, especially the 
Olympic commission and the 

ROY PAKfCUIIRDIIIN 

nations that devote so much money 
to building champion tearns, should 
make sure that their athletes are 
prepared for life after retirement. 
Some of those multimillion-dollar 
contracts should be funneled into a 
program that allows for job training. 
Olympic teams should be afftliated 
with universities that will accept 
them after their peak ages have 
passed. But more importantly, the 
Olympic Commission needs to take 
a long hard look at raising the ages 
for their athletes, allowing them to 
have a better, safer childhood. 

So in the midst of all the hype 
of the Winter OlympiCS, take a sec-
ond to look at those hopefuls who 
don't make it to the podium, those 
who have trained just as hard but 
who. for whatever reason, didn't cut 
it. Imagine now, that this is their 
retirement, their entrance into the 
real world. lmagine how they'll sur-
vive, without much of an education, 
without proper emotional develop-
ment, without the money and glory 
of the gold.

Pork ProjectS

Causes Unfunded 
• KOGAN, from page 4 
als, a technological revolution that 
could make new roads safer during 
powerful earthquakes. Also, the proj-
ect provided a subject for more than 
1 ()() senior and graduate theses. 

And that is why pork projects 
are so alluring for polit icans who 
face regular elections: They surely 
seem perfectly legitimate to the spe-
cial local interests that benefit from 
them, be they UCSD or Alaska. 
(Nevermind, for a second, that if a 
project were really worthy, it would 
receive funding under the regular, 

rig~rously competitive process used 
to award most research grants.) 

In 2005, Congress approved 
13,997 pork projects, according to 
a count kept by the group Citizens 
Against Government Waste. These 
projects cost 527.3 billion -:- far more 
than the 512 billion in cuts to stu-
dent loan and financial aid projects 
Congress enacted this month under 
the guise of reducing the ballooning 
national deficit. 

Universities - even as they pay 
lip service to the dangers of cuning 
financial aid - didn't seem to mind: 
About one in 10 federal pork dollars 
flows to special academic research 
projects. 

Sure, society may have benefited 
from the new knowledge discovered 
by UCSD's bridge project. But imag-
ine how many more poor kids could 
have gone to college with that 57.4 
million. 

Change, though, won't happen any 
time soon. In the meantime, universi-
ties continuts building their bridges 
to nowhere, even as the government 
continues turning a blind eye to the 
most vulnerable and needy in our 
society.

Marshall Introduces African-
American Studies Minor 

By Christine Kwon 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

O ver 30 years ago, Thurgood Marshall College was found-. ed to provide more opportu-
nities in higher education for under-

represent~d groups. Starting in fall 
2006. a new African-American stud-
ies minor will be offered through the 
college to provide a deeper insight 
into the black experience. 

Marshall College has been 
employing the talents and expertise 
of a small group of faculty in the 
fine arts department under UCSD's 
contemporary black arts minor. 
according to music professor Cecil 
Lytle. Recently. however. Lytle and 
other faculty members thought it was 
time to revise the program. The new 
African-American studies minor wiU 
expand the former minor beyond 
the arts. 

Some faculty members have 
described the minor as academically 

rigorous and could be a way to pos-
sibly attract more black students to 
UCSD in the future. 

"The African -American studies 
minor will help guide undergradu· 
ates to a fuller understanding of the 
unique attitudes. circumstances and 
experiences of African Americans:' 
ethnic studies professor David Pellow 
said in an e-mail. 

The newborn minor is especially 
interesting in light of this year's Black 
History Month. In a recent interview 
with "60 Minutes," actor Morgan 
Freeman expressed his dissatisfaction 
with the idea of Black History Month, 
calling it "ridiculous" and arguing 
that "black history is American his-
tory" and should not be relegated to 
a month. 

Is the African-American studies 
minor similarly separating "black 
history" from the general curricu-
lum? Literature professor Robert

Minor Offers 
More Than a 

History Lesson 
• MINOR, from page 7 
Cancel and other board members of 
the minor do not think so. 

" It Iblack history) should be dis-
persed into the general curriculum. 
But the way we do classes here, there's 
only so much room. Every depart-
ment has specialized classes. African-
American culture is so large it can't 
be encapsulated into a survey course; 
Cancel said. "I think it's a study in its 
own right." 

So why an African -American 
studies minor now? "The study of 
African-American culture is a defin· 
ing element of a modern university," 
Lytle stated in an e-mail. UCSD lags 
behind many universities in imple-
menting such studies and in recruit-
ing a diverse student body represen-
tative of the general population. 

"Even though history books have 
sort of been modernized, they're still 
pretty far behind;' Cancel said. "It's 
important that everyone knows about 
things like the Harlem Renaissance 
and the civil rights struggle:' 

One of the main objectives of the 
new minor is to educate students 
about what has remained largely a 
misunderstood, even neglected sub-
ject. 

"Few ethnic or racial groups 
have had so indelible an impact on 
American cultural tastes and hab· 
its than African-American culture," 
Lytle said. "However, few groups have 
been so misunderstood." 

LaCandice McCray of UCSD's 
Black Student Union reiterated that 
the minor would be "a great way 
to raise consciousness. People wiU 
learn the contributions that African 
American.s have made to literature 
and art and history." 

The minor aims to raise such con-
sciousness among black students but 
also for the many other ethnic groups 
at UCSD. "The minor isn't intended 
for only African Americans but all 
segments of the UCSD population," 
Marshall Interim Provost Robert 
Kluender said. . 

. Associale Vice ChanceUor of 
Undergraduate Education Mark 
Appelbaum added that the funda-
mental idea of the minor was for 
students "no matter what their back-
ground" to take a series of courses 
that would enable them to under-
stand some aspecOi of the African· 
American community." 

This sort of knowledge is, Lytle 
explained. immediately important 
and applicable at a time when "most 
knowledge young people have today 
about the lives and contributions of 
African Americans comes through 
fashion, music and politics." 

"The minor hopes to show that the 
descendants of the Africans brought 
to these shores in chains combined 
with many other elements of the 
broader African diaspora to create 
an identifiable cultural idiom; Lytle 
stated. "African-American identity is 
uniquely an American phenomena 
and coUld not have been created any-
where else in the world." 

The other main objective of the 
millor is to help attract and recruit 
more black students to UCSD, 
because, Kluender said, "the campus 
hasn't done the best job it can do in 
attracting people of color." 

Cancel added that qualified black 
students turn down UCSD at a higher 
rate than other ethnic groups. Pan of 
that, Cancel said, is due to a feeling 
that there is no black community 
at UCsD after Californian outlawed 
affirmative action. 

With the introduction of the minor, 
however, Lytle expects that "African-
American students. in particular, 
would find some comfort in knowin(! 
that UC5D, a modern public research 
university, puts forward a study rel-
evant to their Iiws and experiences:' 

Kluender explained that even for 
nonhumanities majors. an African-
American studies minor wouLd aid 
students in finding jobs as it suggests 
knowledge in dealing with diverse 
peoples and serving minority popu . 
lations.

Tritons Pull Off Two Narrow Victories r

,

~ BASKETBALL, from page 12 
two. , .. I just try to make something 
happen," said BuU, who accumulated 
the total in only 13 minutes of play 
off the bench. 

On Feb. 15 against Cal State San 
Bernardino, the Tritons feU behind 
early, down 9-2 three minutes into 
the game. With head coach Bill Carr 
using a number of substitutions and 
the Tritons running their patient 
offensive set, the team climbed back 
into it, erasing the deficit and taking 
their first lead of the game, 14-13, at 
the 11:45 mark. From there, the lead 
would change five more times in the 
half. Bull hit a jumper with three 
seconds left in the half to give the 
Tritons a one-point advantage going 
into the break. 

The second half proved much more 
of a defensive battle than the first , 
which seemed to bode weu for the 
Tritons and their top-ranked defense. 
The Coyotes, despite having four of 

their players suspended by coach Jeff 
Oliver, remained persistent. Though 
they would never lead in the half, 
they prevented the Tritons from push-
ing their lead to double digits. While 
UCSO was successful in holding off 
the Coyotes for nearly 18-and-a-half 
minutes in the second half, Cal State 
San Bernardino mustered enough 
energy for a 6-0 run that tied the 
game, 55-55, with 1:37 left to play. 

~'n that situation every possession 
is critical," Poppen said. 

After a foul by the Coyotes' Jason 
Davis, Poppen came off a cross-
screen at the free-throw line, catch-
ing his defender off guard, and driv-
ing into the lane for a layup and a 
57-55 UCSO lead with 1:13 left to 
play. 

~I knew that I had to go to the · 
hoop strong and make sure we get 
those two points," Poppen s~id. "Then 
we have to just play hard defense." 

With both teams still in the game 

with a minute to play, the Tritons and 
Coyotes played stingy defense and, as 
a result, neither team scored the rest 
of the way. Cal State San Bernardino 
would have three possessions to try 
to tie or win the game, the flnal 
resulting in a three-point attempt by 
Curtis Williams with six seconds left. 
The shot was long and Odiye again 
caught the rebound, holding onto the 
ball as time expired. 

Patterson again led the way to 
victory with a game-high 2 I points 
and team-high six rebounds, while 
Poppen added 12 points, two 
rebounds and two steals in 27 min-
utes off the bench. Allard had a great 
all -around game with five points, five 
rebounds and a game-high six assists, 
the flnal dish leading to Poppen's 
game-winning layup, 

UCSD returns to the road for the 
final time this season, traveling to 
play Cal Poly Pomona on Feb. 24 and 
San Francisco State on Feb. 25.

"' think that [the rally] was a great 
opportunity for our pitching staff to 
learn that we can't let their momen-
tum put is in a hole," O'Brien said. 

The Tritons would go on to score 
three more runs in their half of the 
fifth inning, but it was to no avail, 
as the Broncos held on and added 
another two runs to their total, even-
tually winning the game 11 -6. 

After blowing their lead in game 
one, the Tritons returned to their 
home diamond in game two to avenge 
their earlier loss. In a game that saw 
four lead changes, UCSD went ahead 
for good in the fifth inning with a 
five-run rally. 

"( thought we did a good job stay-
ing mentally strong after giving up 
the lead," Kearney said. "We're a real 

scrappy team and every inning we try 
and beat our opponents." 

The Tritons, despite taking an 
early lead, found themselves down 
by a run after Cal Poly Pomona 
took advantage of sloppy defense 
to go ahead 4-3. However, UCSO's 
three errors did not prove disas-
trous, as the Triton bats made up for 
their iron gloves with a five -run fifth 
inning. The Tritons took a 5-4 lead 
on a sacriflce fly before freshman 
pinch-hitter Matt Cantele homered 
to deep right fleld to give U CSD a 
comfortable 8-4 advantage. 

"Matt is just one of many players 
in a great freshman class," O'Brien 
said. "And that is exactly what we 
need after losing 13 players from last 
season." 

Senior right-hander Ryan Leake 

took to the mound after the raUy 
and pitched three scoreless innings to 
keep the Broncos from regaining the 
lead. Leake was credited with the win, 
his first of the season, in UCSD's sixth 
overall victory. 

"J think our bullpen has done 
really well at shutting teams down and 
maintaining our leads; Kearney said. 

The Tritons currently stand at 6-3 
going into the beginning of California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play, 
which starts this week with the Tritons 
facing Cal State San Bernardino at 
horne on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24. 

~I think we're good enough to win 
our league," O'Brien said. "But we 
have a lot of maturing to do as a team 
and a lot of areas to work on. But if we

Tritons Top Coyotes for 

First Time In D-II History 
Wins over CSUSB 
and CSUMB give 
men's basketball team 
a program-best 13th 
Division-II win. 

By Joe Teve!owilZ 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

"Now we just have our focus on 
making the playoffs." 

That statement by freshman guard 
Shane Poppen comes after his team 
reached many !Yew heights last week, 
including defeating six-time defend-
ing California Collegiate Athletic 
Association champion Cal State San 
Bernardino 57-55 on Feb. 15 and out-
lasted Cal State Monterey Bay 70-67 
on Feb. 17. The Tritons, 13-12 overall 
and 10-6 in conference action, lost a 
lot of close games early in the' season 
and had not beaten San Bernardino 
since the move to NCAA Division 
II. The team also has never finished 
.500 or better in CCAA play, which it 
is now guaranteed to do. And the 13 
wins? Already a two-game improve-
ment over their Division-II best 11 
wins last season. 

"We're playing really well as a 
team, and it just feels good to be on 
a winning streak; sophomore guard 
Ja on Bull said. 

That winning streak is now up 
to four games, their longest streak 
in eight years and another D-II frrs\. 
The growing list of achievements, the 
continued improvement of the team 
and the fact that it is currently tied 
fo r third place in CCAA, three games 
behind the top two seeds with four 
games left to play, are definitely rea-
son enough for the Tritons to focus 
on a playoff appearance, another 
Triton fi rst. . 

On Feb. 17, the stingy Triton 
defense held Cal State Monterey Bay 
to 14 points in the frrst 15 and a half 
minutes of the game, leading 22-14 

with four minutes to play in the half. 
Unfortunately, th~t eight-point lead 
was the most UCSD could manage 
in the period despite holding Cal 
State Monterey Bay below 40 percent 
shooting and forcing six first -half 
turnovers. The Otters exploded for 
11 points in the last four minutes, 
cutting the Triton lead to four, 29-25, 
at intermission. 

Though the Tritons were able to 
capitalize on an early outburst and 
push their lead to seven, UCSD and 
the fans in attendance got a scare 
when freshman forward Henry 
Patterson went to the bench with an 
injury just one minute into the sec-
ond half. As tempers began to flare, 
the two teams battled harder. The 
Otters closed to within three before 
the Tritons pushed the lead up to 
a game-best nine. Patterson would 
return with 13:10 left to play and 
the Tritons holding a seven-point 
advantage. 

At the 2:29 mark, the Otters com-
pleted a 13-3 run and took their first 
lead of the game, 65-64. The Tritons, 
burned early in the season by close 
losses, remained poised. Freshman 
forward Darryl Lawlor responded 
with a three-pointer and after Otters 
center Devoughn Lamont tied the 
game at 67, Bull drove the lane, dished 
it to Patterson, and the CCAA field-
goal percentage leader helped regain 
the lead. Patterson continued his tre-
mendous effort, drawing a charge 
on the defensive end. After holding 
the Otters scoreless in the final two 
minutes, senior guard Odioh Odiye 
and sophomore guard Clint Allard 
each grabbed a crucial rebound to 
preserve the 70-67 victory. 

Odiye and Allard each had a game-
high seven rebounds, while Patterson 
and Bull had career-high nights with 
24 and 17 points, respectively.

Baseball Goes 3-for-4 Against Pomona 

BillY WONG/GUARDIAN 
Senior designated hitter Matt Lawson inches off third base in UCSD's lJ-6 loss to Cal Poly Pomona on Feb. 19. Although the Tritons 
could not come back in this game, they beat the Broncos in the three other meetings between the two tearns on Feb. 18 and 19. 

Tritons head into 
league play after four-
game series against 
the Broncos puts 
them at 6-3 overall.

SPORTS EDITOR 

While the rest of the student 
body relaxed on the holiday week-
end after a tough week of tests, the 
UCSD baseball team spent its break 
playing four games against the Cal 
Poly Pomona Broncos, sweeping the 
first doubleheader on Feb. 18 and 
splitting the second set of games on 
Feb,19. 

In the first doubleheader, played 
in Pomona, Cali£, the Tritons reeled 
off two wins to sweep the Broncos at 
home before traveling to San Diego 

for the second doubleheader. 
Coming off the two-straight 

wins, UCSD couldn't keep the sweep 
.going, allowing the Broncos to steal 
game three away thanks to a seven-
run fUth inning. 

The Tritons came out strong early 
in the loss, scoring three runs in 
the first two innings, while holding 
the Broncos scoreless. However, the 
Broncos bucked free from a shutout 
in the fourth as Marc Evans crushed 
a Byron Grubman pitch over the 
right-field fence for a two-run homer 
that put Cal Poly Pomona within a 
run. 

Grubman managed to end the 
fourth inning with the UCSD lead 
barely intact, but he would not see 
the end of the ftfth irming, as the 
Broncos rallied for seven runs. Cal 
Poly Pomona batted around in the 
inning and scored all seven runs 
with two outs, with the big blow 

coming on Ben Lebovitz's three-run 
homer. After witnessing his starter 
suddenly unable to set down any 
Bronco batters, UCSD head coach 
Dan O'Brien relieved Grubman with 
freshman Derek Barham. Barham 
was coming off the worst outing of 
his career - giving up a walk-off 
home run to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in the bottom of the ninth. His 
confidence did not seem affected, 
however, as he tallied the fmal out 
of the inning to send the Tritons 
back to the dugout suddenly trail-
ing 9-3. 

"We always try to stay away 
from a big inning," junior reliever 
Michael Kearney said. "But this time, 
[Pomona] just came out strong." 

Despite giving up the lead, 
O'Brien found a positive outlook on 
Pomona's rally.

Men's Volleyball Falls Twice In Straight Sets to No.1 Brigham Young 

CARINA WEBER/GUARDIAN 
Sophomore middle b1oc1cer John Marie Wendler's attaclc did not faze the to~ranhd Cougars, 
who b«It the Tritons in straight sets on two occasions, dropping UCSD to 1-I2for the JelJS01I. 

UCSD's anemic attack 
percentages in both 
matches cost Tritons 
a chance at upsetting 
top-ranked Cougars. 

By Paul Choi 
STAFF WRITER 

Whether it was nerves or a lack 
of focus, the UCSD men's volleyball 
team was just out-matched and out-
played, losing back-to-back matches 
in straight sets to top-ranked Brigham 
Young University on Feb. 16 and 18 . 

On Feb. 18, the Tritons fell 27-30, 
21 -30, and 26-30, dropping to 1-12 for 
the season and 0-9 in the Mourltain 
Pacific Sports Federation, while the 
Cougars improved to 12-2 overall and 
10-2 in MPSF play. 

"Playing the No. 1 team in the . 
nation, you would think we would 
come out more fired up than ever, but 
there's definitely a little intimidation," 
senior outside hitter Jon Daze said 
"We need to take it upon ourselves to 
not let that affect us:' 

Both teams struggled to maintain 
long runs due to the combined 43 
service errors, 19 of which were com-
mitted by the Tritons. 

"One of our goals was to play bet-
ter on the second night, improve more 
than they improved," UCSD coach 
Kevin Ring said "It's not too often In 
our season [that we get) to play the 
same team bid to back.-

The Cougars couldn't pull away 

in game one as the Tritons took the 
lead 21-20 on senior opposite Brenden 
Bowe's kill, then again at 26-25 on 
another Bowe kill. 

Only four points away from win-
ning the first game and sending a 
shock to the top-ranked Cougars, 
the Tritons could not find a way to 
score. BYU, on the other hand, had no 
trouble and came back from the one-
point deficit to take a 26-27 lead. The 
Cougars did not look back and closed 
the game with a kill, 27-30. 

After coming so close to a win, 
Ring said that the Tritons' problems at 
the end of game one were all mental 

"We just have to remain disciplined 
and focus on each play and ball con-
tact; Ring said "We can't get ahead of 

' ourselves. We made all the p1ays early 
in the game so there's no doubt In my 
mind that we're able to make the same 
plays to close out the games:' 

In game two, the 'I\itoDJ a1wayI 
played from behind, and were never 
able to catch up. After pullina to within 
two at 7-9, the Coupn extended the 
marzin to IS-20. UCSD once apin 
strugIed to get on the board as BYU 
won the second game 21-30 on an 
error by the Tritons. 

UCSD had several chances to win 
game three, committing 17 erron 
but losing only by four points. The 
Cougars puI1ed ahead 21-28 before the 
Tritons cut the lead down to three at 
26-29 on a kill by senior outside hitter 
Mike Reuter, his fifth of the match. But 
ultimately, BYU sophomore middle 
blocker Trent Sorensen put the match 
awaywitb the ftnal kill at 26-30. 

The close loss was a surprise' con-
sidering the Tritons' -.211 attack per-
centage in game three. 

"Despite the fact that we hit nega-
tive on game three, we were still kind 
of in the game," Ring said "We actu-
ally won many of the long rallies and 
it's just a matter of cutting down on a 
few of our errors and keeping those 
baIls in pIay." 

On Feb. 16, it was the same story, 
different chapter for the two teams, 
with BYU SMeping UCSD 16-30, 23-
30,19-30. 

In game one, BYU did not commit 
a single error and as a team hIt at a .7(j) 
clip to run away with a 16-~ victory in 
game one. 

Daze attributed the blowout to 
UCSD's poor hitting. 

"Our hitting group was struggling 
a bit, our setters had a difficult night 
and our passers were hanging in there, 
but we need to get our middles going 
more,- Daze said. 

After falling behind in game two, 
UCSD could not pull any closer than 
six points, dropping game two 23-30. 

In the final game, UCSD used some 
of its yo~rplayen. such II freshman 
setter Adam CovinBton and freshman 
libero Eric Lesserman. Even with less 
experience on the court. the Tritons 
kept it close, trailing 12-15, but the 
Coogan started to pull away slowly to 
lead 19-27. Eventually, a 'Iiiton attack 
error would end the game 19-30. 

The Tritons will trek through their 
challensInI schtduIe aplnat rmked 
teama, boItiJI8 No. 7 Ua.A OIl Feb. 24 
and No. 3 UC IrvIne on Feb. 25.
