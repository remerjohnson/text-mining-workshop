A rationalist's approach to our raging debate 
By ADAM WARSHAW 

Everyone. please stop caUmg 
each other pe~orauve names 
when you talk about free speech 
It makes a mocket), of the term. 
Ethical debates should be 
conducted in a ranonal manner. 
Leave the "-ist" words to the 
propagand-ists. 

Let's discuss free speech on 
the level of theot)'. What is free 
speech? Mr. Pun and Mr 
Schoenberg have defmed one of 
its circumstances "a semblance of 
equality." FaIr enough but there 
is more. Free speech I the 
ablliry to take a stand on a 
public issue without fear of 
attacks on any grounds other 
than those of logl It l!i nOl "a 
similarity of power and position:' 
as they would have It. As MIll 
ob served . th e truth I s the truth , 
and the social place of ItS 
proponents cannot destroy ItS 
value . To tum ro human hlstol) 
for proof, the ideas of Jesus. 
Marx and GandhI amply prove I 
think. that SOCial standing IS nut 
a prerequisite for mfluence, albelr 
belated at times 

These gentlemen also claIm 
that theIr "alternative thought" IS 
attacked as a means ot denYIng 
them the "right to defIne free 
speech." Wholly mcorrect The 
essence of free debate 15 an 
argument - that IS, a rational 
give-and-take process The nght 
to refute new ethlca views IS a 
pan of the right of free speech 
uentlemen, If your VIews cannot 
take the 'heat,' Stay our of the 

ATTENTION 
all past, present, 

and future 
Opinions writers! 
There will be a 

mandatory meeting 
at the Guardian 
Thursday, Jan. 8 

at 6 pm. 
Be There! 

'kitchen: Do nOt take stands If

As far as CI~I DisobedIence 
goes, I fi nd It very difficult to 
beheve thar a protest agains t

Does the goal of SOCIal change 
really have the nght to an, 
claIms of morahry if It mvolves 
the ~olation of the rlghrs of 
other (dIssenting) oplmon 
holders m sOClet)'1 For -ethIcs to 
be on lyour] Side: gentlemen a 
consistent system of ethics must 
be apparent. Put bluntly, VIOlating 
your own purported ethics (such 
as non-violence') to change the 
mmds of others casts 
tremendous doubt upon the true 
valIdity of the aforemenuoned 
ethlcai pnnclples 

For example, whatever I would 
lIke to see happen to hIm 
notwlthstandln an assault on 
Mr Kroopkm . In reaction to hiS 
Ideas, SImply stinks, and ( would 
agree m the condemnation of 
Mr MacCrone if he is 111 lact 
guIlt)' However Mr. Schoenberg, 
assaultlllg ROTC recruIters IS a~ 
unjustifIable Mr Mlchaelson's 
letter asks. -whIch IS more of an 
mfnngement1" but I thmk he 
has missed the pomt 

Two wrongs do not make a 
nght, nor do they cancel each 
other out. Members of CIVIl 
SOCIety simply do not assault 
each Other as a result of ethIcal 
dIsagreements tt IS never a 'right' 
of free speech to hun another 
person solely because of hIS or 
her vIews. 

As far as a "SIlent maJonty" 
goes. Mr. MIchaelson. the 
argument whIch you presented IS 
symmetrical. If Mr. MacCrone 
has no nght to claim to speak 
for such a group without proof 
then neither do you, evcn In the 
negative If "personally, mOSt of 
[yourl fnends fmd the polincs of 
Schoenberg quite agreeable ," that 
IS not suffICient to make 
Judgements about the audIence 
of your opponent in the debate.

It through the political process,

Vote . Those are moral ways of 
respondmg to 'poor' pohcies, 
because they rake the 'high road ' 
of morality by respecnng the 
nghts of the others who live 
under the political system. Acting 
In other manners invites seorn 
and repressIOn. as it appears 10 
the vaSt majority of people that 
theIr nghts are being violated . It 
IS the only way of preserving any 
kind of freedom , and I am 
paniculariy surprised that you, 
Mr. choenberg. haVlng stood fo r

qUIckly that the key to attainmg 
the respect of others does not he

As a Iree and equal citizen . I 
have a right to speak my mind 

of relevant public issues WIthout 
being assaulted , even verbally. I 
have my opinions. whIch I

In consequence, I gIve to and

1 that my nght 10 speak free

The world is unfonunately full

admitted more students thun the

with the growmg parking 
problem. It has closed parking 
lots to students and re5er'Vcd 
them for faculty. It has contInued 
to construct buildings, taking 
away existing parking spaces in 
the process, neglecting the fact 
that these buildings will attract 
more students to the already 
inadequate parking si tuation, 

It has caUed together large 
bodies of students at places 
unusual, uncomfonable, and 
distant from their rooms. It has 
hired professors who cannot 
convey their complex, often 
irrelevant ideas to the students. 
We are required to stand in long

BEFORE tHE TEST OBTAIN RELEASED COPIES 
OF THE TEST If these are available, they provide 
the most effective basis for achieving familiarity 
with the directions and question-types.~em­
her, practice makes better! 

BE CLEAR ON SCORING PROCEDURES. If 
your test indudes a guessing penalty, random or 
wild guesses can decrease your score. Penalty 
scoring requires inteIli~nt guessing through 
choice elimination. 

EXAMINE YOUR ADMISSION TICKET. As 
soon as you receive it, make certain your identi-
fying information is correct. The day of the test is 
no time to find out there's been a mistake! 

VISIT ruE TEST SITE AHEAD OF TIME. 
Checking out directions and knowing parking, 
bathroom, and water fountain locations can make 
a big difference to your comfort on exam day. 

HAVE A LEAN BREAKFAST AND A GOOD 
NIGHT'S SLEEP. Don't deplete your energy by 
useless late-night cramming or a fat-filled, greasy 
meal that will mean an upset stomach, jitters, or 
extra bathroom trips! 

DURING tHE lIST ARRIVE HALF AN HOUR 
EARlY Why invite disaster by failing to allow for 
traffic snarls? Besides, you'll need time to relax 
and "wind down." 

BRING PENCILS, SHARPENER, ERASERS, In 
ASPIRIN, KLEENEX, AND NO STUDY MATE-
RIALS. !bull need at least four somewhat blunt 
#2 pendls (sharp points tend to break off on the 
test grid>. If you're the nervous type, you might 

'SI ST-
nps 

want to include some light reading to focus and 
relax yourself until the test begins. 

USE A WATCH 10 PACE YOURSELF. If you 
dont have a stopwatch, you may want to set 
your watch back to 9:00 at the beginning of each 
new section. (Though some monitors will let you 
know how much time remains, dont count on this.> 

KEEP A STEADY ffiCE. You know youll get 
the same credit for answering easy questions as 
you will for solving "toughies:' Be sure to capital-
ize on the ones you understand by refusing to 
spend too much time on a few stumpers. 

"MONITOR" YOUR ANSWER GRID Make sure 
extra graphite I'T1a!KS don't get registered as 
answers. Also, prevent tragedy by checking 
question numbers against grid numbers every 
ten answers. 

AfTER THE TEST TALK 10 US. If you feel your 
performanoe was dismal enough to merit cancel-
lation, check with your Kaplan instructor. (This 
applies particularly if you were ill during the test.> 
Objective discussion of your concerns may help 
you realize you didn't do as badly as you think. 

YOU CAN CANCEL SCORES. If yoo. do want to 
canoel your score, yotill need to notify the test 
aPministrators in writi!}g within three ~. 
<Remember that even if you dont cancel and a 
school receives multiple scores from you, they 
will count the highest.> 

GOOD liCK! From all of us at the Stanley H. 
Kaplan Center, before, during. and after your test, 
our sincere wishes for success.

n ight, but all inspections may 
only take place dunng regular 
business hours, 

Also many toxic compounds, 
known as non-cmena pollutants, 
arc not regulateu under the EPA 
permll at a ll ! Any amount of 
those pollutants may be spewed 
into the atmo>phere. 
Hydrochloric ac id from the plant 
IS hkely to build up under the 
a tmostphen c inve rSIOn layer, 
present most days in the area, 
according to th e San Diego AI r 
f'ollullon Control DIstrict. 

I would guess that the 
University is also unaware of the 
twO "Chemobyl-type" graphite 
nuclear reactors at th e GA Site. 
and that th ey probably don't 
suspect there could be a terrible 
accident involVing aCCidental 
burn ing of radioactive waste with 
WIdespread contamination. 

It IS hoped that Chancellor 
Atkinson will get involved . He 
should ask for a full and 
complere Environmental Impact 
_ tatement to be made with an 
opportunity for pubhc testimony 
to address these problems. He 
rnay send this rt!quest to Vern 
Christianson at the US 
Environmental PrOlccllon Agency 
(EPA), regt on 9, 215 Fremont

He should also wri te 10 the 
Govemor, (he Californta 
Depanment of Health Services, 
and our district's State 
Assemblyman and Senator. 

Perhaps Chancellor Atkinson 
is Jusr waiting to know how we 
feel about living next to a toxic 
waste incinerator, so he can take 
a stand against this hazardous 
operation. Give the Chancellor's 
olTice a call . His number is 534-

As saints and sinners, nuns and heretics, visionaries, mystics, witches, and worshippers, women 
were protagonists of much of late medieval mystic life · so much so that scholars have spoken of a 
general "feminization" of piety in this period. This course will explore the religious roles assigned to 
women by social expectations and the roles assumed or desired by women. It will treat such issues 
as the tension between the formal powers of the male ecclesiastical hierarchy and the informal 
powers 01 female visionaries and prophets, the relation between models of sanctity and the 
devotional life of ordinary believers, the function of holy women as challenges to and upholders of 
existing political and social structures, and the role of women in the religious orders and in parish 
Me. A sample of current European scholarship on these issues will be made available in translation.

stuJie~ in the country. Othcr 
IIlS[I[UIiOnS wl[h thiS program arc 
.It private universities, suc h as 
John Hopkins, Tults, 
Georgetown , and Columbia. 

Although UCSD has the only 
eX lsrll1g graduate sc hool of thiS 
kind on the west CO,ISt, many 
other Calitorl1la instllution ~ arc 
Jumping on the proverbl.i1 
"bandwagon ." New programs and 
majors with emph.I,ls on 
imcrdi sc lplll1ary ,1Ild PacifiC 
studies are being developed a t 
UCLA, Berkeley, Stanford and 
DSU . 
Talk of such a school at UCSD 

began as early as 1982 when 
Roger Revelle began circulating 
memos which sketched ,I 
"professional s hool of PaCific 
and/ or Latin American relations." 
Meanwhile , existing international 
studies programs on campus had 
been developing and , according 
to Gourevitch , there were ideas 
about creating a new graduate 
program which would balance 
the UniverSity'S rapid 
undergraduate growth . 

t n the faU of 1984, when 
President of the University DaYld 
Gardner began emphasizing 
Intemational studies as a major 
theme of his administration, "it 
then became clea r to this 
cam pus that we had an 
opportunity to put all the pieces 
together:' Gourevitch said. 

It is now Acting Admissions 
Officer Tom Reckord 's job to 
spread the word to potential 
students. He docs so by going to 
various unive rsities and speaking 
in classes or at career or 
intemational days. "I believe 
thcre was a tremendous pem-up 
demand for a schelol such as this 
one in the UC system" he said. 
He finds it especially gratifying 
that such an opportunity is now 
available to students at such an 
affordable price. 

There have been a few 
objections raised by UCSD 
faculty members cone em I ng the 
speed with wh ic h the ambitious 
project is advancmg. However, 
Gourevitch remains confident: "I 
believe our youth and relative 
lack of development in some 
areas is an advanklge. We're 
better on' trying to do someth ing 
different on a campus I which is] 
not already deeply 
institutionalized ." m

No use crying 
over spilled food 
By GERALD STONE 

I N the continuing spirit of de mystifying that austere personage , the College 
Professor, allow me to share with 
you my treatise : "Foods I Have 
Spill,ed on Student Papers." 

Now I'm nO[ referring to 
anything so mundane as teachers 
leaving coffee cup rings on 
student papers when answering 
rhe telephone, I'm talking real 
food StaIl1S: avocado dip or 
cheese cake , 

Knowledgeable students easily 
discern telltale spIlled food signs 
by a ye llow stain and slight 
crumpling in a specific regi on of 
the returned paper, A sta inless 
paper crumpled equally across 
the enure sheet is more likely to 
have been thrown in the trash 
basket once during the grading 
process, perhaps by mistake 

But having a paper thrown in 
rhe trash during the grading 
process is something that's 
probably happened to everyone , 
The real Issue here IS exotic food 
stall1s dropped on student 
papers, 

T here was the time a set of 
papcr~ was wedgcd Into m)' 
bnefcase companmem adjaccnt 
to a notso -c. Jrcfully wrappcJ 

bologna sand.wich on white 
bread with lenuce and Dijon 
mustard . I had forgotten that 
morning when making the 
sa ndwich that I had a luncheon 
engagement, so the briefcase 
remained in the locked car 
under 96-degree temperatures for 
about four hours. It was not qUite 
long enough to cook the bologna, 
but the heat caused the waxed 
paper to unravel. Each studcnt 
paper received an edge sauteed 
in Dijon , and one benefited 
additionally from the wilted 
lettuce, 

Small potatoes? I thought so 
too, so I graded them and turned 
them back without a word " , nor 
was a word raised, 

Onc other major in'cident 
II1volved soup - borsc h actually, 
with whole beets and carrots, 
Our calJumped on th e table , and 
I knocked the bowl over as 1 . 
swa[[cd at her with my trusty 
sick le (it 's a ~ttle gamc we play), 
In thiS inst.1ncc the borsch mess 
was parually covered by the 
extens ive red grading marks 
already on the papers, I 
apologized to students about the

member trcl11si.ucs for the 
parents. 

The Bo)'s Club hilS had its 
problems over the )'ear... In Los 
Angcles, where gang Viole nce IS 
high. thc BO)'5 Club has had to 
work extm hard at creati ng a 
"neUTral zonc" I11side its walls. 
There have even been limes 
when members would check 
their knives ,1t the doo r before 
enteri ng. Cunningham says that 
these measures arc not warranted 
In Sa n Diego. 

Any problems that the Boys 
lub has arc far out:veighed by 

Its successes. Cunningham cites 
one man's stOry a a perfect 
example of a Boys Club success 
story. Wayne Cross practically 
grew up in the Boys Club of San 
Diego where he learned to swim 
and learned life saving 
techniques. He got a job through 
the Club as a ity lifeguard, and 
then became involved in the City 
di ing program. From the money 
he earned doing {his, he is 
paying his way through law 
sc hool at USD. 

About a year ago, the Boys 
Club of America hired a private 
company to survey former 
members to see if the program 
had done any good. The sutvey 
found that there were 3,500,000 
Boys Club alumni . Seventy-four 
percent said that the Club 
helped them avoid trouble with 
the law, and 93 percent had 
never been convicted or a cri me. 
The sutvey also indicated that 
the Boys Club helped to break 
the so-called '\velfare cycle" in 
which children who come from 
welfare homes remain on welfare 
throughout their lives. The survey 
found that from the 22 percent 
or boys who came from welfare 
homes, only three percent now 
receive publtc ass istance. Seven 
01 ten boys credit the Boys Club 
with helping them to avoid 
problems with drugs and alcohol. 

Cunningham says that many 
alumni come back to volunteer 
in Boys Clubs. Sometimes lortncr 
members get their sons involved 
with the Club as well . 

everal UC 0 tudents are 
presently working with the Boys 
Club of San Otego. Cunningham 
says that college students make 
excellent role models and tuto rs 
for the boys. He encourJges 
fraternities and sorori ti es to get 
involved and to t.lke a group of 
boys to basketball games or other 
actiVIties. Anyone 111tercstcd in 
Hum'l11 ervices would gre.llly 
benefit lrom volunteer duty at 
the Boys lub, Cunningham 
saId. 

The Boys Club, and all who 
breathe lire im,) it "hould be 
congrawlated for maktng many 
boys' lives decem in an often 
indecent world , ~

Psychoanalytic theory, whether one sU5Crilxs to It or not, IS an inescapable part of the twenlieth",cntury Critical scene. Do Freud and his successors (Fr~'\Jdlan , 
post.Freudlans, antl-Fr""dians ... ) have anyth1ng to say that mIght further our understanding of works of art? Or is it all really Irrelevant? The purpose of this 
seminar IS to take an 0p"n-mmded, critical approach to the work of three leading psychoanalysts whose theories of the mmd have been brought to bear on works of 
art and the art-making process: Freud himself, Jacques (" the nmror sta~c") Lacan , and D.W. ("art and play") Wlnnicott. Major reaUlngs will be Freud's The 
lmerpretauon of Dream.!, Lacan's &'TilS, and Wind/cott 's Playing and RealllJ.

The machine's effect upon culture In general and art 10 particular - and, conversely, the artist's mOSt "ffectlve response to thIS threat /challtnll" _ has been hody 
debated durlnS! the last twO centunes a t Industrlahzatlon. ThIs Seminar Will review the Interconnected discour es concerning the mechanization of VISual

century professlonalizatlon of Industrial design ; artists' varying responses to the Impactof photography, 20th cenrury machine art involVing industrial matenals and

and satiric prints. 

VAll 7, NARRATIVE STRUCTURE IN VISUAL ARTS. PROFESSOR JACK GREENSTEIN. W Noon.2:S0P Mandeville 106 (8601) 
How can a fixed image represent events in time? This question was ar the heart of a Renaissance theory of art that promoted the representation of hmoria, or the 
narranve subject , as tht' paint.r's greatest achievement. By fOCUSing on the problems of repr "",ing biblical themes. problems raised by the various descriptions of 
me same event in different books of the Bible and by the multiple Significances these events held. this course will investigate the strategies of storytelling in rhe art 
and theory of the late Middle Ag.,. and Renaissance and the consequences of these strate!;ies for understanding the meaningof art. Special attention will be given to 
Leon Satisra Alberti 's On Painting and its impact on Mantegna, P,ero della Francisca, anelltalian art of the mid.fift.enth century.

Metamorphoses of the Symbol: Mountains 
Lec A Tfh 2:30·3:50 P&L 1111 cc6590 
Instructor: Fred Randel 
The climber of Mt. Shasta or the skier at Mammoth or the visitor to Yosemite 
Valley may take for granted the impressiveness and exhilaration provided by 
mountam scenery. But such responses are largely products of cultural history: 
mountains were once thought to be hideous and melancholy reminders of 
human sinfulness. The present course will consider some of the literary texts 
which have had the largest influence on forming the modern Anglo--American 
perception of mountains : including bibilical passages about Moses, Elijah and 
Jesus on various mountains; Petrarch's narrative of his ascentofMt. Ventoux; 
Milton's treannent of mountains in heaven and on earth; the English Romatic 
poets' conceptions of mountains in works by Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, 
Keats, and P.B. Shelley; the Victorian celebration and analysis by John RUSKin, 
Leslie Stephen, and Edward Whymper; the feminist reevaluation by Mary 
Shelley in Frankenstein and Jane Harrison in selected passages from her writings; 
and John Muir's influential exposition of the graneur of California's mountains.

Genres in English and American LiteTature: 
'The Rhetoric of Emerson and Thoreau 
Lee A MWF 9:00-10:20 WC 410 #1 "6989 
Instructor: lamel erelliwhite 
In this course we will examine the major writings of Emerson and Thoreau with 
the primary aims of kenning their rhetoric and discovering the ways in which it 
determines the literary forms they employ. By " rhetoric," I mean their 
understanding of the relations among author, experience, reality, language, 
writing, genre, and audience. We will be concerned with this rhetoric insofaras 
it is explicitly expressed in their more "theoretical" writings, insofar as it is 
metaphorized in their discussions of other topics, and insofar as it is put into 
play in their authorial decisions regarding form and genre, decisions we can 
uncover o nly though close reading and discussion of their major works. By the 
end of the course, perhaps we will have glimpsed, in regard to literary form, 
what Emerson calls "the profoundly secret pass that leads from fate to 
freedom."

This course will be divided into three stages. First, we will briefly examine the 

evolution of current theones 0 fe;ninistliterary analysis. Second, we will 
consider feminist rewritings of history, with particular attention to how they 
treat the difficult relationship between white and non-white women, Third, we 
will examine particular instances of ethnic and third world feminism in essays, 
poems and short stories by Afro-American and Latin American women. The 
course will emphasize writing and discussion .

Conflict and Repression in the Public and Pri""re Spheres: 
Readings in Contemporary Latin American Fiction 
Lee A TIh 11:30-12:50 USB 40208 cc6677 
Instructor: Beatrice Pita 
In this course the Latin American works in translation that we will read allow for 
dicussion centered around the themes of conflict and repression in the rublic 
and private spheres. The course will focus on the literary representation of 
relationships (social and personal), repression (individual and collective) and 
violence (physical and psychological). The readings, which include selections by 
several women writers, will permit an analysis of various views on male-female 
relations as well as on sexual and political repression. Texts will include an 
anthology of short stories to be read in the first part of the course, as well as 
Manuel Puig's The Kiss of the Spider Woman ; Luisa Valenzuela's Other Weapons 
and Antonio Skarmeta's The Insurrection.

Lee A MWF 11:00·11:50 USB 3030A cc6678 
Instructor: Paaquale Verdicchio 
A survey course of 20th cenrury Italian Literarure; will include prose, poetry, 
and film. Discussion of neorealism and it's relationship to film will be done in 
light of pre-twentieth century movements such as Verismo. 

Lit/ Gen 164 
From Myth to LiteTature 
Lee A TIh 11:30-12:50 HSS 1128 "6683 
Inatructor: Stephen Potta 
The course will begin with a historical survey of the fantastic - embracing 
ancient myth, medieval romance, fairy tale and Marchen -then move quickly 
into the twentieth-cenrury fiction that uses the fantasic as its foundation. We 
will discuss the forms that fantasy takes in our rationalist era - heroic, gothic, 
surrealist, magic realist - and read across the spectrum from Tolkien to Kafka. 
Expect guest appearances from modern fantasists Greg Bear (The Infini" 
Concerto) and Raymond Feist (The R i{lWar Saga), who will talk to the class about 
their approaches to fantasy.
