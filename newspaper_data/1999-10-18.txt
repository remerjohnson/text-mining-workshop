Minister Natan Sharansky 
announced Sunday that he had 
ended an Israeli policy that had 
stripped thousands of 
Palestinians from East Jerusalem 
of their right to live there. 

Human rights groups and 
Palestinians have condemned 
the practice as a "quiet deporta-
tion" that they say was intended 
to curb Arab population growth 
in East Jerusalem, whose future 
is to be determined in talks 
between Israel and the 
Palestinians on a permanent 
peace.

CELEBRATION: Center marks its third anniversary with lunch and discussion 

Guardian Reporter 

The Women's Center cele-
brated its third birthday on 
Thursday with a noon lun-
cheon and a panel of women 
speakers who discussed the his-
tory of the women's movement 
atUCSD. 

The Women's Center pro-
vides women with many vital 
resources such as peer counsel-
ing, outreach events and birth 
control courses. The panel also 
discussed the women's studies 
major, which has grown and is 
now known as critical gender 
studies. 

The celebration began at 
noon with food and music. At 4 
p.m., a panel was held; among 
those speaking were communi-
cations Professor Chandra 

Mukerji, urban studies and 
family Ipreventative medicine 
Professor Barbara Brody, litera-
ture and critical gender studies 
Professor Kathryn Shevelow, 
Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography (510) librarian 
Deborah Day, International 
Center Director Mary Dhooge 
and UCSD alumna Leng Loh. 

The speakers addressed 
many topics, including the differ-
ent roles women have played in 
overcoming gender-related 
obstacles at UCSD and the fight 
for women's health programs. 
They also spoke about the rise in 
academic equality and showed 
how deeply it is rooted in UCSD 
history even though it is rarely 
acknowledged. 

During her speech, Day 
showed a 1963 news article 
whose headline ' stated, "SD 

Mother wins Nobel Prize." The 
person referred to in the head-
line was Maria Mayer, the first 
American to win the Nobel 
Prize in Physics. She said that 
the headline was significant 
because it showed that Mayer 
was not recognized as a scien-
tist, but rather as a mother. 

Day also presented a slide 
show that depicted the last 100 
years of the struggle for 
women's rights. The slides 
showed how women were 
instrumental in building the 
Scripps Institute. 

Day talked about the many 
women who were early leaders 
at the institute. including Ellen B. 
Scripps, who donated the money 
to build 510. Scripps had attend-
ed and graduated from college

Council 
Debates 
Fee Hike 
EXPANSION: UCAB's 
upcoming election created 
a debate Wednesday night 
By JENNIFER KAPLAN 
Staff Writer 

Not-yet concrete plans for the 
proposed expansion of the Price 
and Student Centers took a step 
closer to being etched in stone 
Wednesday. 

In a council caucus at its recent 
meeting, the A.S. Council dis-
cussed the proposed fee increase 
that would fund the expansion of 
the Student Centers and the 
repair of the building that houses 
the Che Cafe. Students will be 
asked to vote on the proposal 
later this month. 

Doc Khaleghi, who introduced 
the original proposition to the 
AS. Council, said that the student 
facilities need to be expanded 
eventually. He said that the issue 
simply revolves around when the 
expansions should take place. 

"This is going to happen," he 
said . "It is just a question of now 
or later." 

The student facilities now 
accommodate approximately 
15,000 students. After renovations, 
the centers will be equipped to 
hold 30,000 to 35,000 students. 

Khaleghi said that the school is 
going to need more facilities such 
as conference rooms to accommo-
date future populations. The 
Campus Planning Office projects 
that 24,000 students will be 
enrolled at UCSD in 2006-2007. 

In order for this initiative to 
pass, approximately 20 percent of 
students must vote in favor of the 
expansion . 

If the fee referendum passes, 
student fees will increase by $25 
per student, per quarter once the 
expansion project is complete. 
Every five years the fees may be

Professor Finds 1960s Fostered Right Wingers 
STUDY: UCSD sociologist recently released a book that documents the history of the '60s generation 
By scon DOIROSKI 
Guardian Reporter 

It is hard to imagine a decade 
more infused with the symbols 
of liberal activism than the 1960s, 
with its long-haired "flower chil-
dren" protesting war and vio-
lence and staging sit-ins for 
peace and social justice. 

However, in a new book titled 
A Wnmrtion Divitkd: The Ntw 
Left, tilt Ntw Right, and lhe 19605, 
UCSD sociology Professor 
Rebecca Klatch states that the 
1960& were not solely character-
ized by left-wing action in poIiti-

cal socialization, but rather by 
both left- and right-wing party 
members. 

Klatch's book, which uncov-
ers a series of parallels between 
activists on both sides of the 
political spectrum during the 
19605, states that the '60s pro-
duced a generation of both left-
wing and right-wing political 
leaders. 

"The '60s must be seen with-
in this larger context," Klatch 
said, "Not only as fostering 
protests on the left, but also as 
nurturing a new generation of 
leaders on the right. Much of the 

conservative backlash of the 
19705 and 1980s was led by pe0-
ple of the same age as leftish 
activists. " 

While activists of the right 
and the left may seem to had lit-
tle in common, Klatch's book 
reveals how the two political 
organizations have common 
bonds during the '60s. 

Klatch states that through 
overlapping concerns and activi-
ties, such as opposition to the 
Vietnam War and the draft, dis-
approval of police brutality and 
a counter-culture in which many 
of the members of both the right-

wing and left-wing organiza-
tions used drug and alcohol sub-
stances, both left- and right-
wingers of the '60s era did in fact 
have much in common, much 
more than that which is 
acknowledged today. 

"Activists in both groups 
were serious and idealistic, 
deeply committed to their prin-
ciples, and dedicated to creating 
social change," Klatch states. 
"All shared a passion for poli-
tics that formed the core of their 
lives and became central to their

ContInued frOlll INIC- 1 
but had never received her degree 
because women were not allowed 
to get college degrees at that time. 

Shevelow related the "exhila-
rating" yet devastating story of 
trying to bring about a women's 
fo tudies major at UCSD. In 1991 
the program received three years 
of funding as well as much-need-
ed office space. 

Shevelow said that while it wa 
"appalling" to continue to have to 
defend the legitimacy of the 
women's studies major, persis-
tence made it possible for women's 
studies to go from a very unknown 
minor, accepted in 1982, to a com-
plete and accepted major in 1991 . 

Mukerji discussed In her 
speech the disadvantage thut 
women encounter In academic 
opportunities, the sexual hurass-
ment of graduate students by pro-
fessors and the fact that although 
women were allowed to do the

adjust for inflation. 

A.S. Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Rosaline Chan said she 
was uncertain about the fee 
increase because it would place 
too much power in UCAB's hands. 

"The $5 increase is very prob-
lematic to me," she said, "UCAB 
has control of increasing the fees, 
not the tudents." 

basic "bottom of the ladder" sci-
entific work, there were no 
research opportunities for them. 
She added that they were not con-
sidered " regular" members of the 
faculty. Mukerji expressed the 
disappointment that she and oth-
ers underwent as the quest for a 
women's center failed time and 
time again. The inception of a 
Women's Center was finally real-
ized three years ago. 

Shevelow said that in addition 
to the many members of the fac-
ulty and administration working 
to advance the women's studies 
major and the Women's Center, 
students were also a very crucial 
part of the entire project. 

Loh, a UCSD student at the 
time of the center's founding, 
spoke 'on the student aspect of 
the quest for raising awareness 
in women of color. She said that 
by gearing herself primarily 
toward Asian-Americans and 
later all minorities, she was able 
to raise awareness for all women 
and aid in the journey toward a 
Women's Center in cooperation 
with others from an ethnic stud-
ies course. 

A.5. Vice President Finance 
Eric Rovner said he had reserva-
tions concerning availability of 
the new facilities to students over 
corporations. 

Khaleghi said he fears that stu-
dents will be given an advantage 
over corporations in that they will 
be able to book rooms earlier. 

"Students can book a confer-
ence room six months in advance 
whereas corporations can book a 
room only three months in 
advance," Khaleghi said. 

Whether construction on the 
centers will begin this spring will 
be decided when students vote on 
the measure Oct. 25-28.

each year,· said Beverly Sheppard, acting dlrBCtor of 
IMLS. 

The IMLS is an Independent federal grant-making

Class-action lawsuit') defend citizens from the negligent and 
wantonly unhealthy products of irre~ponsible companies 

By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Here's a riddle for you: what 
two things are painfully simple to 
use, readily available to most 
people, instantly enhance the 
image of any young person and 
are legal everywhere in the coun-
try yet kill hundreds of thousands 
of people every year? Brownie 
points to you if you guessed guns 
and cigarettes. 

In several recent class-action 
cases, individual citizens and 
organizations have attacked the 
makers of these products. The 
plaintiffs in the gun cases allege 
that gun manufacturers are neg-
ligent in their design and mar-
keting, that they fail . to ade-
quately incorporate available 
safety f~atures and that they · 
downplay the risks that firearms 
pose. 

These companies' marketing 
campaigns go so far as to claim 
that the presence of guns make 
homes safer. 

Conversely, statistics show 
that the presence of guns in 
homes actually drastically 
increases the risk of homicides. In 
almost an insinuation of first-
degree murder, plaintiffs argue 
that firearms companies flood the 
legal market with more guns than 
it can handle, creating an over-
flow into tN; black market. 

Claims of liability against 
tobacco industry magnates sug-
gest that companies illegally tar-
get underage smokers and bla-
tantly lie about nicotine's addic-
tive nature and the dangerous 

effects smoking and secondhand 
smoke. There is even evidence to 
suggest that these companies 
have conspired to withhold 
research studies that would 
expose these hazards. 

The plaintiffs in tobacco and 
firearm cases are blazing a rocky 
trail to physical safety. Their legal 
struggles are an attempt to pro-
tect others from suffering the 
often deadly consequences of 

ignorance. 
Unfortunately, the current 

established methods of litigation 
are often unable to achieve these 
results. 

The Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) has saved 
the lives of countless individu-
als, many of them children, by 
developing stricter standards for 
manufactured . items. It has 
helped prevent lead poisoning 
from household paint and seri-
ous bicycle injuries through 
stricter regulations. It also has 
required the child proofing of 
cigarette lighters and substances 
such as aspirin and prescription 
drugs. 

So why does the CPSC seem 
to ignore firearms and cigarettes, 

two of the most potentially dead-
ly products sold in America? The 
reason is a federal law passed by 
Congress in 1976 that removed 
both firearms and tobacco prod-
ucts from CPSC jurisdiction in 
one fell swoop. 

With the long history of legis-
lators monetarily and politically 
supported by the NRA and lob-
byists from the tobacco industry, 
it is no surprise that the highly 
celebrated 40-state tobacco settle-
ment failed, or that a number of 
state laws around the country 
have granted immunity to gun 
manufacturers in liability law-
suits. 

As with many civil rights 
cases in the past, the unreason-
able actions of legislators have 
now forced organizations, such 
as the anti-violence faction of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
(NAACP), out of the lobbying 
arena and into the justice depart-
ment. Only in legal battles can 
they make what grueling 
progress they can achieve 
toward preventing unjustified 
fatalities. 

Government leaders also 
have a responsibility to their cit-
izens. Many governments are 
following this example in the 
case of firearm and tobacco 
industry. 

Perhaps when enough people 
speak out against the unjust prac-
tices of these companies, we can 
cease the senseless trade in death 
that they started with a pistol 
shot and a cloud of smoke.

Self-serving lawyers in class-action suits do not help protect 
consumers nor the constitutiooal rights of the majority 

By PARiSA IAHARIAN 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Class-action lawsuits have 
long been a tool for a large por-
tion of society to right horren-
dous wrongs. Yet when a group 
of powerful attorneys systemati-
cally sues companies with the 
sole intention of changing legisla-

. tion through litigation, c1ass-
action lawsuits become haz-
ardous to the rights of society. 

The class-action suits recently 
brought against large tobacco com-
panies were for the most part very 
successful and very lucrative 
because individuals, cities, states 
and even the national government 
got in on the action, walking away 
with a huge chunk of change. 

But for the most part, the c1ass-
action craze got carried away -
lawyers reaped the big bucks 
while their clients came up short-
changed. 

For example, in 1991, two 
lawyers named Rosenblatt filed a 
class-action suit against the lead-
ing cigarette makers, claiming that 
as many as 6O,<XXl flight attendants 
suffered harmful health effects by 
involuntary 'exposure to second-
hand smoke. In 1997 the two 
lawyers walked away with $49 
million, while the flight attendants 
received absolutely nothing. 

Obviously, justice wasn't 
served in this case. 

Want more examples of how 
the greedy few trample the rights 
of the majority? 

Let us take a look at another 
recent example of litigation: c1ass-
action lawsuits against gun man-

ufacturers. Powerful attorneys 
have teamed up to file multiple 
class-action lawsuits against the 
gun industry, trying to hold it 
liable for the murders that crimi-
nals commit. These attorneys 
have a sinister underlying 
motive; as trial lawyer John Coale 
told Tire New Yorker, "[We) have 
the resources to start· a war 
instead of taking little potshots." 

con 
GU P IAN OPINION 

Class-action lawyers use ail 
the tricks available to them, such 
as "judge shopping": looking for 
extremely liberal judges to hear 
their cases. 

According to the July 19 
Nnliollnl Law /ollmnl, the NAACP 
angled to get its new suit against 
gunmakers heard by Brooklyn's 
extremely liberal senior Judge 
Jack Weinstein, because the 
underlying theories "might not 
succeed in any other courtroom 
in America," a fact that is rather 
revealing about the weak consti-
tutionality of the case. 

Judge Weinstein has proven 
himself numerous times to be an 
important ally to the gun litiga-
tion cause. Consider the explo-
sive case of Hamiltoll v. Accu-Tek, 
over which he presided . The jury 
deliberated for almost six days 

and informed the judge many 
times that they were hopelessly 
deadlocked . Judge Weinstein, 
however, refused to accept a 
hung jury and instead declared a 
mistrial, thus forcing the jury to 
reach a compromise verdict out 
of frustration and exhaustion. 

The jury held three gun manu-
facturers liable for seven shoot-
ings, and the only survivor, 
Steven Fox, was awarded 
$500,000. The interesting thing is 
that F<;>x was accidentally shot by 
a friend who had bought the gun 
on the street. The emphasis is that 
it wa~ purchased on the street. 

How can the gun industry 
possibly be held responsible for 
the actions of a person who has 
put himself beyond the jurisdic-
tion of the law? 

Yes, it is the gun industry's 
duty to sell its guns to licensed 
distributors. A breach of this duty, 
and any injury directly caused 
from that violation, would be the 
responsibility of the gun industry. 
But this was not the case in 
Hamilloll v. ACCII-Tek. 

Once the gun industry sells its 
guns to licensed distributors, then 
it's the responsibility of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (ATF) to regulate and 
monitor any firearm purchases 
that are made. As required by the 
Brady Law, licensed distributors 
must impose a waiting period of 
five days before selling the hand-
gun to an unlicensed person. 
Noncompliance subjects the 
firearm licensee to license suspen-

Deliver Us From Chemistry Lab CON: Law enforcement is 
the true solution 
ContIIIued ,.... ..... 4 

COMMENTARY: Chern 6BL teaches nothing of value and strains students' time and patience 

C5HANNON !f\.STI..E 
As you're reading this, 

there's a pretty good chance that 
I'm either in my chem 6BL lec-
ture, in my chem 6BL lab, or 
writing up a lab for chem 6BL. 
This is my life. 

If I'm in lecture, it goes some-
thing like this: 

Me: "Doug, what has the pro-
fessor been talking about for the 
last 20 minutes?" 

Chemistry-friend Doug: 
"Nothing you don' t already 
know. Go back to your Spanish 
homework." 

Lab is an entirely different 
scenario. There, I actually have 
to pay attention. 

Me: "1 have 25 different tem-
perature readings for this beaker 
of water. What do I do now?" 
• T.A.: "Repeat everything you 

just did." 
Me: "Why?" 
T.A.: "So that you know for 

sure that cold water heats up 
when you dump hot water into 
it. Don' t forget to write at least 
30 pages about this incredible 
phenomenon in your note-
book." 

An exercise in boredom, the 
lab write-up itself is too long and 
painful for me to summarize. I'll 
spare you the details. 

For those of you fortunate 
enough to be unfamiliar with 
chem 6BL, a.k.a. "Introductory 

Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory," 
I'll give you a quick overview. 
According to the UCSD General 
Catalog, it is an "introduction to 
experimental procedures used in 
synthetic, analytical and physical 
chemistry." Surviving the course 
yields three whole units. What 
the catalog fails to mention, how-
ever, is that the class constitutes 
about 10 units worth of brainless 

impossible to get into the class as 
a freshman. Though the' catalog 
told me to take 6BL concurrently 
with chem 68 or 6C, the class 
filled up so quickly with upper-
classmen who hadn't gotten in 
when they were freshmen that I 
had to put it off. 

I was so discouraged, in fact, 
that I postponed it until now, 
the start of my junior year. I 

The fact that chern 6Bl doesn't require much thought 
doesn't mean you'll get a good grade in it. Cheating 
by copying old labs, while strongly discouraged, is 
rampant. The graders take this into account by 
grading harder, operating under the assumption that 
everyone is copying.· Those of us with integrity (not to 
mention a fear of university expulsion) are therefore 
penalized for our less-than-perlect, all-original lab 
write-ups. 

busy work. 
The creators of this class, in 

an effort to reinforce the con-
cepts of the chemistry six-series, 
challenge students to follow 
simple instructions, regurgitate 
basic information and to record 
it all in explicit detail in a fairly 
expensive notebook. The end 
resu lt is a surprising lack of 
knowledge and perpetual hand 
cramps. 

Granted, allowing laboratory 
neophytes to do real chemistry 
might prove dangerous. After 
a II, the class is designed for 
freshmen, who might hurt them-
selves if they played with acid. 
But then again, it's almost 

would feel like a slacker, but the 
only two people I know in the 
class are a year older than me. 
(Doug, Dustin : That's you. But 
it's OK.) This situation effective-
ly removes the lab as a part of 
the six-series. Sadly, the two-
year absence from chemistry 
hasn't made this lab any harder 
for me. 

The fact that chem 6BL 
doesn't require much thought 
doesn't mean you'll get a good 
grade in it. Cheating by copying 
old labs, while strongly 
discouraged, is rampant. The 
graders take this into account by 

~rading harder, operating under 
the assumption that everyone is 

copying. Those of us with 
integrity (not to mention a fear 
of university expulsion) are 
therefore penalized for our less-
than-perfect, all-original lab 
write-ups. Is this fair? 

Once again hapless students 
are being abused b~ the universi-
ty overlords. In this case it's 
worse than usual, because the 
overlords are very, very fond of 
chemistry. They force a huge 
number of people, from biology 
majors to engineers, to take a 
class which may not teach them 
anything of substance. 

How many engineers are 
going to be making coffee cup 
calorimeters in the near future? 
How many biology majors are 
going to need to know how to 
titrate once they switch into 
psychology? Let's hope they 
end up doing something a little 
more constructive with their 
degrees. 

I propose that we reserve the 
pain and terror of the under-
graduate chem labs for those 
'people that really need them: 
the pre-meds. Medical schools 
still require a lab class, no mat-
ter how poor it may be. I'll 
work on changing their require-
ments later, right after I con-
vince the UCSD chemists to 
spa re us all. 

Until then, comrades, pray 
for my sorry, tired-of-mindless-
chemistry sou l when you pass 
by me on your way to a better 
class. I'll be the one over by York 
Hall, carrying the really big 
notebook.

sion or revocation and a civil fine 
of no more than $5,000. 

Therefore, it is the ATF's 
enforcement of these laws that 
must be changed. Why mount a 
full-blown attack ' on the gun 
industry unless the true goal is to 
completely halt the manufacture 
of guns, which would eventually 
take all guns out of the hands of 
law-abiding citizens? 

The fact of the matter is that 
these malicious class-action law-
sui ts are successful. Cities and 
states, along with private individ-
uals, are suing the gun industry 
all at once. 

Attorney Dennis Henigan of 
the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence said that what he's after 
is to create a "credible threat of 
liability .... The more cities that 
file, the greater the threat." 

It's obvious the lawyers are 
out to ruin the gun industry by 
the sheer quantity of class-action 
suits. And it's working. Colt 
Manufacturing Company, unable 
to deal with over $1 million a 
day in legal defense fees, conse-
quently announced that it would 
stop selling handguns to citizens. 

Score one for the lawyers. But 
are these class-action lawsuits 
really in the public's best interests? 

A closer look reveals that these 
class-action sui ts have set a dan-
gerous precedent: No new guns 
mea ns no new gun ow ners, 
which will most likely lead to the 
complete ban of all handguns. 

On every day that we don't receive letters to the editor, we will execute one rabbit until our demands are met. 

What about the public's con-
stitu tional right to bear arms? 
These class-action suits have one 
purpose: the eventual ban of all

San Diego Shuns Its Spanish Influenees 
COMMENTARY: American prejudice and rejection of foreign culture suppress Latino culture even in this border city 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Staff Wflter 

Years a~o, when I first moved 
to San Diego, I did so with great 
exci tement and expectations. 
Part of th at, I admit, had a lot to 
do with geography: The idea of 
living in an area with such a mild 
climate so close to the ocean had 
great appeal. Another reason 
was cu ltural - Sa n Diego was 
attrac tive to me because it was 
located at the boundary between 
two different cultures and w<lys 
of life: the puritan, Anglo-Saxon 
Uni ted Sta tes <lnd the Latin 
Mexico. 

Based on the experience of 
European frontier towns, I 
expected a city in which the two 
worlds mingled and became 
inextricably inter twined, a per-
fectly billllgu<ll, bicultural (pos-
sIbly multicultural ) social set-
ting. 

I am ~Iad to report that the 
weather and the ocean (despi te a 
few EI ino winters) lived up to 
my expecta tion . I wish I could 
say the same of the ~ocial ~ettin~. 

The two worlds that the 
whIms of geography have 
brought close to touching are 
kept cilrefully separa ted. The 
downtown area represents the 
clearly demarcated border 
between the Anglo-Saxon north 
and the Latin south. Mingling is 
kept to a mInimum and limited to 
such eX IgencIes as haVIng ,1 well-
kept garden for a reaso nable 
price, or having maintenance 
work done on one's apartment. 

Much to my amazement, very 
few AmerIcan an Diegans speak 
Spanish. When I started s tudy-
ing Spanish a few years ago, I 

attracted mostly amused com-
ments, as if I was indulging in 
some eccentric hobby. As a mat-
ter of fact, <III my Spanish classes 
are constantly on the verge of 
being canceled and replaced by 
vocational English classes due to 
a lack of student interest. 
Apparently Mexicans are quite 
eager to learn English (as they 
should be, since they live here), 
while Americans are not quite so 
eager to learn Spanish (which is 
surprising, since they too live on 
the border). 

Very similar observations can 
be made for most aspects of San 
Diego's rather limited cultural 
life. It is surprising, for instance, 
that in a city with such a large 
Hispanic population, there is only 
one Spanish TV channel and very 
few Spanish radio stations, and 
that the incredibly rich Latin 
American literature is almost 
completely absent from San 
Diego bookstores. 

Writers like Coelho or 
Sep ul veda are a much more fre-
quent sight in European press 
and television (located 10,000 
mIles away) than they are here. 
Even more surprising, it is virtu-
ally impossible to find a book-
store in San Diego with a good 
selection of books in Spanish (if 
you don't believe me, walk into 
the UCSD Bookstore and ask.) 

In the midst of the debate on 
bilingual ed ucation, I tried to pro-
pose tAat in this day and age, and 
III San Di ego in parti cular, it 
would be advantageous for all 
s tudents, Mexicans and 
AmerIcans alike, to receive a per-
fect ly bilingual (a nd bicultural) 
education. People stared at me, 
unsure whether I was joking or if 

Look Who's eotMi"g ... 

The concerted and 
almost complete 
elimination of Spanish 

• influences from 
mainstream culture is 
particularly evident in San 
Diego, but it is a natural 
consequence of a more 
generalized American 
repulsion of foreign 
cultures. 

I had lost my mind. 
The concerted and almost 

complete elimination of Spanish 
influences from mainstream cul-
ture is particularly evident in San 
Diego, but it is a natural conse-
quence of a more generalized 
American repulsion of foreign 
cultures. The American main-
stream is a rigidly delineated ter-
ritory, in which any foreign influ-
ence is rigorously filtered and iso-
lated to make it as harmless as 
possible. 

So the music on our radios is 
almost exclusively Anglo-Saxon, 

foreign films have a very limited 
distribution, the availability of for-
eign books is scarce and the public 
debate on issues of international 
interest is grinding to a halt. 

There is an apparent contra-
diction here. The United States is 
the immigration country par 
excellence, the country that 
allegedly embraces and incorpo-
rates all cultures. 

The United States is also the 
country that developed or, at 
least, popularized much of the 
technology that made the global 
communication networks and 
allowed the creation of the global 
economy. It is curious that such a 
country should resist the cultural 
interchange that is the obvious 
result of these developments. 

Maybe the reason is found in 
the United States' role as an 
"immigration country." For a 
country sure of its origins and its 
cultural heritage, it is easy to be 
open to new cultures. But where 
can we find two Amrricans who 
can reasonably be described as 
sharing the same origins and cul-
tural heritage? 

For a long time America was 
not just a land of immigration, 
but a land of desperate immigra-
tion, a land populated by 
Europeans of the lower social 
classes who had left behind a 
family and a way of life with few -
or no intentions of ever going 
back. 

To these people America 
offered the only thing that it had: 
the opportunity to be part of a 
new country, to find a new 
(metaphorical) family. Little mat-
ter if this new allegiance had to 
be sealed with the slightly infan-
tile symbols of love for the flag or 

the pledge of allegiance: some-
times the simplest symbols are 
also the most effective, and for an 
Irish peasant loving the flag is 
sometimes a lot easier than 
understanding the ideology and 
political theory of Thomas 
Jefferson. 

Somewhere along the road this 
solution, created to facilitate 
assimilation, was radicalized and 
became a rigid cage, based on the 
illusion of a uniform cultural 
identity which is, incidentally, 
rather alien to the nature of this 
country. This, combined with the 
natural arrogance of a rich, strong 
and expanding country, led to the 
current rejectiol\ of (oreign cul-
tures and their relegation to an 
underground, strictly delineated 
subculture separated from the ' 
mainstream. 

Ironically, most of the "tradi-
tional," white, Christian, 
American culture is merely an 
elaboration of European models 
(models, coincidentally, thaJ 
Europe abandoned decades ago), 
while the truly original American 
experience always comes from 
the confrontation of alien cul-
tures. Multiculturalism is the 
truly original message that 
America can export. [n renounc-
ing foreign influences, Americans 
are renouncing their own contri-
butions to world culture. 

At a time when the mixing of 
cultures is becoming common in 
other areas of the world - where 
it was once the almost exclusive 
province of America - the 
American closure from Mexico 
could signify our demise as a sig-
nificant cultural and social world 
presence.

I have il quote for those of you 
who see this as a good thing: 

"This year will go down in his-
tory. For the first time, a civilized 
nation has full registration! Our 
streets will be safer, our police 
more efficient and the world will 
follow our lead into the future!" 

These are the words of Adolf 
Hitler. When the time came, he 
was able to disarm German citi-
zens who owned firearms, 
removing any ilrmed opposition 
to his campaign of terror. 

Steven Halbrook, il constitu-
tional expert, commented to the 
George Masoll Law RelJlfW, "[The 
government] disarms only those 
who are neither inclined nor 
determined to commit crimes ... 
this serves rather to encoura~e 
than to prevent homicides, for an 
unarmed man can be attacked 
with greate~, confidence than an 
armed man. 

We must take a stand to place

American Who Brought Pepsi to

networks of too-wealthy · As a rising executive at the 
tycoons, to throngs of street Pepsi-Cola Corp. in 1959, 
urchins and trash bin-miners Kendall bucked his elders and 
trampled in the stampede to set up fountain dispensers at 
wealth. 

All in all, he said, it could 
have been worse. 

"The changes are unbeliev-
able,"Donald M. Kendall said . 
"People keep talking about 
crime and corruption and not 
about the amazing things that 
have happened here. You can' t 
believe the merchandise in the 
stores and the shopping cen-
ters. 

"Go out on the street and 
look at the traffic jams, at the 
cars. They're not just Mercedes. 
The changes here go deeper than 
that." . 

Even to dream about such 
things a decade ago, he said, 
"would have been absolutely 
impossible." 

Kendall is that rarest of 
Americans, not to mention 
native Muscovites: someone 

"Go out on the street and

Moscow's Sokolniki Park, where 
the Soviet leader Nikita 
Khrushchev and Vice President 
Richard Nixon were about to 
christen the first American trade 
exhibition ever held in the Soviet 
Union. 

The next day, Sokolniki was 
the scene of the famous finger-
wagging "kitchen debate" 
between Khrushchev and 

Nixon. As the two men verbally 
slugged it out over the merits of 
capitalism and communism, 
Nixon steered Khrushchev to 
the Pepsi pavilion for sips of 
soda. 

Pepsi reaped a publicity 
windfall the company's elders 
never expected . Kendall became 
CEO in 1965. A decade later he 
negotiated a monopoly for Pepsi 
on cola sales with Khrushchev 's 
successors that stood until the 
Soviet Union fell eight years 
ago. 

Now president of the East-
West Institute, an organization 
broadly devoted to 'better 
understanding and relation-
ships between Russia and the 
West, Kendall argues that turn-
ing one's back on Russia at its 
low point would be a huge mis-
take. 

"I was always convinced 
that we had to open this place 
up instead of isolating it, and I 
still am," he said. "It's going to 
come out in the end because 
they've got a younger genera-
tion here that's well-educated 
and doesn't want to go back to

In the clearest evidence yet 
that recent efforts to reduce 
gun violence thrqugh new laws 
and police pressure are work-
ing, an FBI report released 
Sunday shows that a 7 percent 
drop in homicides in 1998 was 
accounted for entirely by a 
decrease in killings committed 
with guns. 

The report also indicates that 
a significant drop in robberies 
carried out with guns helped 
account for a 10 percent decline 
in robberies nationwide, the 
biggest decrease of anyone cate-
gory of crime. 

Overall, the FBI's annual 
Uniform Crime Report found that 
violent crimes and property 
crimes each dropped 6 percent 
last year, marking the seventh 
consecutive year that serious 
crime has fallen and the largest 
single yearly decline in the 1990s. 

The national murder rate has 
now fallen to 6.3 per 100,000, 
which was the level in 1967, 
when crime first exploded in the 
United States. 

Alfred Blumstein, a professor 

of criminology at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 
said, "These numbers suggest to

the hands of young people, are 
having some effect." 

Among these are increased 
efforts by the Federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Pirearms to 
trace guns used in crimes; the 
tighter federal restrictions 
imposed on gun purchases by the 
Brady law of 1994; and new gun-
control laws passed by numerous 

states, like those limiting pur-
chasers to one handgun a month. 

In addition, the police and 
·prosecutors in many cities, 
including New York and Boston, 
have devised ways to cut off the 
supply of illegal handguns to 
criminals and juveniles or make 
them wary about carrying guns 
for fear of arrest. 

Another good sign in the 
report, Blumstein said, was that 
the percentage of homicide vic-
tims who were female dropped 11 
percent in 1998, suggesting that 
legaljmd social efforts (0 prevent 
domestic abuse were working. 

Geoffrey Canada, the presi-
dent of the Rheedlen Centers for 
Children and Families, a nonprof-
it social service agency in Harlem, 
said he believed that prolonged 
prosperity had finally provided 
more jobs in poor minority neigh-
borhoods, "so people now see 
other people working and they 
get the message that work pays, 
crime doesn't."

Larry Hershman, UC vice presi-
dent for budget. Currently, none 
of the state's funding for the UC 
is available for housing. (U-WIRE) SA FRANCISCO 

- In response to an influx of 
more than 60,000 more students 
by 201 0 - nicknamed Tidal Wave 
2 - the UC Board of Regents 
Thursday was presented with 
several possible responses to han-
dling the children of the baby 
boomer generation. 

Under the California Master 
Plan for Higher Education, the 
UC system is committed to pro-
viding an education for the top 
12.5 percent of all high school 
graduates, according to UC 
spokesman Brad Hayward. 

Previous UC predictions esti-
mated that by 2010, 186,000 stu-
dents would be enrolling at UC 
campuses. Currently there are 
around 150,000 students enrolled 
and more recent estimates by the 
Department of Finance (DOF), 
the California Postsecondary 
Education Committee and the 
University of California, place the 
number of students enrolled in 
2010 at approximately 210,000 -
a growth of 43 percent. 

In the 1960s, when the original 
Tidal Wave - the baby boomer 
generation - hit, the university 
had increases in enrollment of 
about 6,000 students a year for 
seven years. But, at that time, 
three new universities were intro-
duced to absorb the increase.

"I think the housing problem 
is beyond our capacity to solve, 
and we need to get the state of 
California in on it," Regent Ward 
Connerly said. 

Another concern by the uni-
versity, is the fact that in the past 
30 years, while undergraduate 
enrollment has increased by 100 
percent, graduate enrollment has 
only grown by around 7 percent. 

The university produces 10 
percent, of the nation's Ph.D.s, 
many of whom remain in 
California to teach in the 
California State University (CSU) 
system. This increase in enroll-
ment will require an increasing 
number of rrofessors from a rela-
tively smal pool of prospects. 

In response, the university is 
planning on maintaining the per-
centage of graduate students in 
the UC at 18 percent of the entire 
student body in the face of 
decreasing enrollment over the 
past 10 years. 

"We believe this is about the 
best we can do," Atkinson said. 

On April 1, the office of the 
president will present a report to 
the state legislature outlining the 
UC's plan to deal with Tidal 
Wave 2. 

Another report will also be 
delivered to the regents at their 
March meeting, Hershman said .

p..,....m. 

CAMBRIOCE, Mass. - When 
it comes to tuition payments, 
Harvard UniverSity will not 
accept American Express, Visa or 
Mastercard. Despite a trend 
among colleges to allow payment 
of tuition by credit card, the Ivy 
League school firmly refuses. 

Credit cards charge a small fee 
per purchase. This would cause 
Harvard to increase undergradu-
ate tuition in order to recoup the 
loss of the fee, said Nona Strauss, 
director of financial services at 
Harvard . 

And while many students are 
willing to absorb the fee in order 
to reap the benefits of using a 
credit card - frequent-flier miles 
or 2 percent cash back - students 
paying traditionally would also 
have to pay the increase in 
tuition. 

Government banking regula-
tions prohibit selective assess-

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. - A 

former Ku Klux Klan member 
and former Director of 
Propaganda for Aryan Nation: a 
neo-nazi group, spoke to 
Pennsylvania State University 
students Thursday. Floyd 
Cochran gives his speech, "Inside 
the Racist Movement: The State 
of Hate in Pennsylvania," in an 
attempt to educate students 
about the dangerous belief of 
racist groups. 

One of Cochran's previous 
roles was to recruit young chil-
dren into the white supremacy 
activities. One popular way to do 
so is through organized religion, 
he said . 

"Young white males and 
females are joining organized 
racist ~angs in record numbers 
today: Cochran said . 

HISTORY: 
Study traced the 
lives of '60s activists 

identity. Even more remarkable, 
during the course of the 1960s 
overlapping interests brought 
together segments of the left and 
right as some members of YAF 
[Young Americans for Freedom) 
and SDS [Students for a 
Democratic Society) discovered 
common bonds of ideology and 
action." 

A Ge/leratio/l Divided traces the 
lives of SOS and YAF activists 
from their political awakenings 
to their involvement in and com-
mitment to political causes dur-
ing the 19605. The book docu-
ments the radicalization many 
activists faced as their lives 
changed over the course of the 
decade. It is the story of two 
wings of one generation and their 
relationships, tensions, compati-
bilities and their fates. 

----~.----

According to ' Cochran, 
Pennsylvania ranks fourth 
among U.s. states for numbers of 
organized white supremacy 
groups. 

Students at the event said that

ST. LOUIS, Mo. - 89-year-old 
Doris "Granny 0" Haddock, 
who began her walking trek 
across the country in Los Angeles 
on Jan. 1, stopped in St. Louis last 
Saturday. 

Haddock spoke at a small 
rally, promoting the need for 
campaign finance reform. Her 
trek has been a walking lobby-
ing effort to encourage cam-
paign finance reform. She 
believes that reform is good for 
the nation. 

Haddock is planning to end 
her effort by arriving in 
Washington D.C. on her 90th 
birthday, Jan. 22.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. - While 
in prison, Unabomber Theodore 
Kaczynski received both hate 
mail and letters of admiration. 
Those letters now belong to the 
University of Michigan's Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library, where 
there already exists a collection of 
anarchist materials. 

The letters, when stacked 
together, measure almost 5 feet, 
said UniverSity spokesperson 
Joanne Nesbit. 

Kaczynski is serving four life 
sentences for being linked to 16 
bombing attacks between 1978 
and 1995 that injured 29 and 
killed three people. 

The original documents will 
not be available to the public. 
Instead, photocopies will be 
given out with people's names 
blacked out. Also, materials used 
in his trial case will not be avail-
able until Kaczynski has exhaust-
ed all options for appeal. The uni-
versity has plans to request these 
materials. 

"The main question is 
whether this material is relevant 
to scholarly research and the 
answer is clearly yes,"University 
President Lee Bollinger said . 

The University's Labadie 
Collection is one of the world's 
most extensive collections of, 
works of anarchism and social 
protest. 

- Michignll Dnily 

"While most people on the left 
and the right maintained their 
beliefs and values as adults, it 
was the right-wing activists who 
moved leftward, not the reverse," 
Klatch states. 

The book examines how these 
activists adjusted to life after the 
19605, and found that, contrary to 
popular perceptions, the leftists 
of the era did not "sell out" in 
subsequent years. 

Klatch's book, which has been 
praised by both longtime conser-
vative leader and publisher 
William F. Buckley and California 

The UCSD Guardian 

Just the greatest career opportunity 
of our lifetime.

14 FEATURES The UCSD Guardian Monday. October 18. 1999 

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Don't let stereotypes about your activities construct your identity 

BRENT DON 
OpilJ ion Hditor 

The Constitut ion of the United 
tates prevents the ~overnment 

from gra nting titles of nobility to 
its citizens. This is abhorrent to 
America ns' inherent sense of na r-
cissism, so people have devoted 
hundreds of yea rs to devisi ng 
titles to rep lace the anti qua ted 
ranks of roya lty. Offic-er. Doctor. 
Judge. CEO. All intended to 
define the bea rer in a socia l con-
text, to explain what they do and 
who they are. 

Who they are? Is your identity 
limi ted to what you do? Is that all 
there i~ to a human bei ng? 

Our society places consider-
able importan.ce on what a per-
son does for a living. We view 
bankers and corpora te execu-
tives as successfu l people. We 
respect police offi ce rs and 
ga rbage men fo r doing jobs that 
are unpleasa nt but necessa ry. We 
look down on fas t-food workers 
and gao station attend ants as 

hift les~ peop le who are s tuck in 
dea d-end jobs. 

So we start out on the path to 
find our titles of identity at an 
early age. We pick a job we 
want, then pursue the appropri-
ate college degree to attain that 
goal. 

Some people try to buck this 
system, putting off figuring out 
what they want their title to be, 
and choose not to declare a major. 
The university tolerates this for a 
while; it assures these wayward 
students that it's just a phase 

cal scientists weren't any good at 
anything else they tried. By the 
same token, these professions 
tend to attnct a class of individu-
als that fits into these stereotypes. 
Like attracts like, even if the ini-
tial impressions that entice these 
aspiring professionals are ill-
founded . 

This system of classifying pe0-
ple according to their jobs only 
promotes homogeneity within a 
profession. It fosters predictabili-

assume that everyone who reads 
this article will accept the notion 
that it is essential and healthy. I 
cannot presuppose that all college 
students and faculty, merely by 
virtue of their presence at insti-
tutes of higher learning, are nec-
essarily open-minded and toler-
ant, because isn't that stereotyp-
ing as well? 

If you look around this cam-
pus and see a lack of diversity, 
can you help but wonder if some-

I'm tired of people thinking that they know everything 
about me after I tell them ~ little bit about myself. So I 
make a conscious effort to prevent them from seeing 
anything that will cause them to stereotype me. 
they' re going through. But after a 
couple of years of being unde-
clared you have to settle down 
and pick a major, a title, a future 
- or you' re gone. Nevermind 
that many of these people know 
exactly what it is that they want 
to do with their lives - they are 
just unfortunate in that their 
goals don' t happen to conform 
with any of the university's pre-
manufactured lives. 

This kind of preoccupation 
with titles begets stereotypes. 
Computer scientists are anti-
social. Medical students are back-
stabbing and competitive. Politi-

ty and complacency. It brings in 
weakness. 

From a young age we tell chil-
dren that lawyers and politicians 
are crooked, that they are greedy 
and underhanded and untrust-
worthy. Is it any wonder, then, 
that the best of these kids will 
grow tip with an aversion to these 

prof~sions, that those of them 
who are hardworking and have 
moral integrity will disdain these 
pursuits because they have come 
to associate them with immorali-
ty and injustice? 

I have to advocate the cause of 
diversity here because I cannot 

one higher up in the system does-
n't get it? That they don't realize 
that engineers and tl'achers and 
doctors shouldn't all come from 
the same mold, like some two-
dimensional profile stamped 
from a cookie cutter? 

And if you clon't see a lack of 
div~ty, can you help but won-
der why all these other reople are 
complaining about it al the time? 
That maybe these people have 
different needs than you? Maybe 
you have found everything you 
need at this school, but perhaps 
other people need access to a 
wider base of cultures and ideas 

in order to feel that their educa-
tion has enriched them. 

I'm tired of people thinking 
that they know everything about 
me after I tell them a little bit 
about myself. So I make a con-
scious effort to prevent them from 
seeing anything that will cause 
them to stereotype·me. I try not to 
tell people that I listen to heavy 
metal becaUlie I don't like getting 
weird looks. I don't advertiSt.' the 
fact that I'm in a fraternity 
because I don't want to have to 
absolve myself of all the rreeon-
ceptions that it entails. avoid 
admitting that I want to be a 
writer because I can only hear 
about how I'm going to wind up 
a jobless, destitute alcoholic so 
many times before I go mad. 

I don't even want people to 
know that I try not to let them 
stereotype me because I'm afraid 
of being labeled a nonconformist. 
Our culture is so status-conscious 
that we actually label people who 
resist definition. 

Are you typical of the type of 
person who comes to UCSD? 
Are you trying to become the 
kind of person who has graduat-
ed from UCSD? Or are you an 
individual, someone who just 
happens to be using this school 
as a means to an end, to enrich 
yourself, not to tell you whom 
you should be? 

Are you going to be created by 
your job, or are you going to cre-
ate your own job?

Monday and Tuesday are 
your best days for groups. You'll 
have more patience. Stop worry-
ing about an old project on 
Wednesday. You can get it done 
by Thursday. You'll be hot to trot 
on Thursday and Friday. It'll be 
easy to lap the pack. On Satur-

tition; take care. Rest Sunday, in 
the most comfortable spot you 
can find . 

TAURUS 
April 20 - M~y 20 

Your life should get easier this 
weekend when a partner comes to 
your rescue. Monday and Tuesday 
are slow; make plans. On Wednes-
day and Thursday, get together 
with friends and figure out who'll 
do what. You'll have to take action 
on Friday and Saturday, whether 
you're ready or not. Make deci-
sions Sunday. You should know by 
then. 

GEMINI 
May 21 -.ltme 21 

You've been lucky in love for 
the past few weeks; now your 
workload's increasing. On Mon-

day and Tuesday, play hard, as a 
final fling. You could get a new 
assignment on Wednesday or 
Thursday. Get it right. The com-
petition's intense on Friday and 
Saturday; pay attention! Finish

What do you think of the 
proposed UCSD trolley stop?

Your luck's improving this

you can entertain soon. Make a 
purchase on Monday or Tuesday. 
Travel on Wednesday and Thurs-

- and Saturday, too. You get 
more powerful by then, so don't 
worry. By Sunday, you should 
feel in control of your situation. 
Make the choice that best suits 
you. 

LEO 
./tt~y 23 - Aug. 22 

• You 've been learning, but 
now it's time to apply the lesson . 
Go along with a partner 's sug-

attention to where you're going 
and get back home as soon as 
possible. 

VIRGO 
Aug. 23 - Sept. 22 

There's plenty of work on 
Monday and Tuesday. Rake in the 
money then. Tuesday and 
Wednesday are best for investi-
gating a legal matter. Look for the 
money on Thursday and Friday. 
Don't let other people waste 
YOlJfS on Saturday. Rather than 
traveling, visit a friend via phone 
or e-mail on Sunday.

SMOKING: 
The largest companies use 
resources to educate youth 
Continued frOlll ..... 13 
ed smoking as a way to rebel against author-
ity. 

"When I was 12, my best friend and I 
would climb up on her roof after she had a 
fight with her mom," elson said. "She'd 
steal her mom's menthol [cigarettes). It was 
her way of rebelling, and she needed compa-
ny up there." 

"I've quit many times." She said that an 
oral fixation keeps her from quitting perma-
nently. 

RJR's "Right Decisions, Right Now" 
youth non-smoking program aims its mes-
sage at junior high school students, retailers 
and parents who wish to talk to their children 
about not smoking. RJR provides funding for 
programs to supplement other juvenile non-
smoking efforts in school and in the home. 

"Studies show that the key factors affect-
ing youth smoking are the influence of 
peers and family, and that restricting acces-
sibility to cigarettes helps reduce youth 
smoking," reports RJR program officials. 

Recently, President Clinton, in an envi-
ronmental speech in Virginia recognized 
Philip Morris' new efforts as long overdue. 

"After years of denial and deception, the 
Philip Morris company has admitted that 
cigarette smoking ca uses lung cancer and 
other diseases," Clinton said. According to the October 1998 issue of 

the IOllmal of Adole;;wll Health, 4,800 adoles-

barrage of negative . 
press regarding tobacco 
companies' responsibil-
ity and accountability in 
light of recent trends, 

Source: The National Household ment between the Fed-
Survey eral Trade Commission 

and RJR, the latter 
agreed to pay $206 billion and discontinue 
its Joe Camel advertising campaign. This 10-
year-old campaign had been accused of 
improperly' targeting children. These ads 
were being held responsible for the rising 
numbers of youth smokers. 

both Philip Morris and RJR have begun 
multi-million dollnr campaigns to revamp 
their image. 

In addition to publically acknowledging 
the harmful effects of moking and the 
addictive quality of nicotine, cigarette com-
panies are working With public health offi-
cials to target juvenile moking. 

Recently, Philip Morris und RJR hnve 
organized information and made it available 
to the public. Philip Morris' Youth Smoking 
Pre"ention depurtment utilizes four stra te-
gies to prevent you th smoking. These include 
communication, educntion, community 
action and access prevention. 

RJR manufactures one out of four ciga-
rettes sold In the domestic market. The 
company makes four of the nation's 10 best-
elling brands: Winston, Camel, Salem and 

Doral. According to its web si te, RJR sub-
scribes to the belief that children should not 
smoke adult products. 

"The major issues regarding underage 
smoking nnd cigarette marketing have been 
addressed by the Master Settlement Agree-
ment, signed ov. 23, 1998, by the major U.s. 
tobacco companies and 46 states," reports 
RJR. 

The result? "Over the next 25 years, the 
states will be provided with up to $246 bil-
lion, which can be used to desiKn local solu-
tions to address underage smoking and to 
enforce the sett lement's new rules and 
restrictions on cigarette marketing." The set-
tlement also outlines a multi-pronged 
approach to cutting back youth smoking and 
creates new resources for non-smoking pro-
grams aimed at youth. 

Philip Morris owns 19 brands of ciga-
rettes, in addition to the Marlboro line. 
According to the company, in ]998, one out

" early 60 percent of kids who smoke 
use Marlboro, the most heavily advertised 
brand,"reported the CampaigrWer tobacco 
Free Kids. 

"Marlboro Reds were the thing to smoke 
in high school," elson said. She also listed 
American Spirits and Camel cigarettes as 
earlier brand choices. 

The sa le of tobacco products to minors has 
been banned nationwide. According to the 
American Lung Association, advertising and 
promotions are restricted in eight states and 
the District of Columbia. The distribution of 
free sample products is restricted in 43 states

Qultttnc r 
The largest problem about ~moking ' is 

that it's addictive. Unfortunately, by the 
time smokers decide to quit, it is too late. 
They're already hooked . 

"Although 70 percent of smokers wa, t to 
stop smoking and 34 percent attempt to .juit 
each year, only 2.5 percent succeed," the 
American Lung Association reports.

OBSERVATIONS 

BEN GLEIBERMAN 
Comrib14ling StaJ! Writer 

Recently I have been faced 
with a rather unpleasant realiza-
tion. It is one that has come about 
after a long period of time, and 
I'm not particularly proud to 
admit it. This realization is that 
my expectations of girls have 
dropped drastically over the past 
couple of years. Why lower your 
standards, you might ask. 

Simple: desperation. 
However true my theory may 

be is immaterial. I have found it 
to be true, and that's all that 
matters. Understand that this is 
only my perspective. I'm sure 
you ladies are going to have just 
as many complaints as I do, but 
writing an article on "Why Guys 
Are Dumb" just didn't seem as 
interesting to me. Anyway, it 
seems that there are no interest-
ing girls out there anymore. 

I used to dream of the "per-
fect woman," one with a person-
ality so dynamic that I would 
revel in her company. Nowa-
days,l'm impressed when a girl 
says or does anything that 
appears to require individual 
thought. When a girl initiates a 
conversation, approaches me or 
even comes up with an interest-
ing way to phrase something, 
I'm awestruck. Unfortunately 
it's usually just a fluke, and the

particular girl will quickly 
return to the world of blandness 
in which so many girls seem to 
be floating around contently. 

Even when I do find a girl 
intriguing enough to take out on 
a date, the intrigue usually goes 
away. I end up realizing that the 
"mysterious" look I thought she 
had was really just one of confu-
sion over where she thought she

indicate that it was her turn to 
talk. 

I was fresh out of things to ask 
when she finally said, "You've 
gotten to know so much about 
me, but I don't know anything 
about you!" 

Thank goodness. Some inter-
est in someone other than herself. 
Relieved, I asked "Well, what do 
you want to know?" to which she 

I haven't given up hope, 
though. I know the kind of girl I 
want to be with is out there, 
somewhere. Hopefully some-
where in this zip code, too. It 
would be a shame if that "dream 
woman" I spoke of was sitting in 
a cafe in Luzern, Switzerland, 
thinking, "Why the hell won't 
this guy say anything substan-
tive?" 

I used to dream of the 'perfect woman, ' .one with a per-
sonality so dynamic that I would revel in her company. 
Nowadays, I'm impressed when a girl says or does any-
thing that appears to require individual thought. 

The other day in one of my 
classes, I asked this girl her 
name. She answered that it was 
Rebecca. Two hours later when 
class ended, she came up to me 
(lots of plus points right there), 
and said something so simple, 
yet so damn imrressive. She _ 
said, "Bye Ben." remembered 
her name and said, "Goodnight, 
Rebecca." 

left her lip gloss. Ah, the mys-
tery! 

First dates have been nothing 
more than an exercise in holding 
a one-way conversation and 
pretending I'm interested in 
why she has no idea what she 
wants to do witt! her life, even 
though she just graduated from 
college. 

Honestly, ladies, the one-way 
conversation thing has got to 
stop. Are all girls incarable of 

. realizing the necessity 0 at least 
two people participating in a con-
versation? Or do you just not 
care? I prefer to think the latter. 

I would prefer to think that 
women just don't want to have 
conversations with me, rather 
than thinking they aren't that 
good at it. Is that what it is? Do 

of Five' over '90210: I almost spit 
up my dessert and told him about 
the big prank." 

I hope that's what it is, 
because that would mean there 
are women out there with this 
thing called a personality just 
waiting to come 'aut. Unfortu-
nately, I fear this may only be a 
dream. 

I was on a first date with a girl 
about a month ago, and I was fir-
ing off questions hoping that 
something I brought up would 
spark an opinion or an interesting 
thought. At that point I would 
have settled for indications of a 
pulse. She hadn't asked me one 
question, or made any meaning-
ful conversation despite my 
numerous long pauses and "So ... 
uhm"s that I had hoped would 

DELOITTE CONSULnNG: 

said, 1 swear to God, "I don't 
know. I can't think of anything to 
ask." 

Was she kidding me? Not one 
question. What's your major? 
What are your friends like? Why 
did you ask me out? (That last 
question, by the way, is one I 
started wondering myself about 
an hour-and-a-half earlier.) Need-
less to say, we didn't date much 
more after that. 

I think that it's fair to say that 
I'm more than a lillIe bitter, 
although if you're a girl on a date 
with me, you probably wouldn't 
say that. Or anything else for that 
matter. You may think I've just 
been looking in the wrong places. 
I hope so, but if that's true, the 
right places are better hidden 
than AI Gore's personality. 

Then she really surprised me 
by smiling and saying. "That was 
your test. You passed." 

This simple exchange kept 
me happy for days and left me 
anxious for our next meeting. Is 
this evidence that my standards 
have dropped? Maybe. But I just 
loved that she wanted to test me 
and was confident enough to tell 
me about it. It showed a confi-
dence and a personality that is 
very appealing to me. Maybe 
unimportant to some; but it's 
just what I'm looking for. 

I don't know if anything is 
going to come of Rebecca and 
me. I'm keeping my hopes up. 
I'd like to think that this may be 
someone worth paying attention 
to. But, if not, I'm moving to 
Switzerland.

You and your friends will enjoy 
the first part of the week, but 
you'll need to get busy later. Study

SMOKING: 
Short-term effects 
used to target yuuth 

"Over 85 percent of smokers 
say that cigarettes are addictive. 
60 percent of light smokers have 
at least one indicator of addiction. 
The high rate of relapse is a conse-
quence of the effect of nicotine 
dependence." 

Aside from long-term health 
concerns, there are other reasons to 
quit. New research shows that tar-
geting teens with information 
regarding short-term problems 
instead of abstract, long-term 
health concerns is a better way to 
stop juvenile smokers. These rea-
sons, not often considered, are list-
ed by the National Cancer Institute. 

"You can taste and smell food 
better. Your breath smells better. 
Your cough goes away." In addi-
tion, people who quit smoking 
will see the difference in the 
money that they save. A pack-a-
day smoker can expect to save at 
least $700 per year. 

Eliminating the presence of 
smokers is one way to reduce 
temptation for those trying to quit 
or for those considering starting. 
New laws have been passed that 
prevent smokers in California 
from smoking in restaurants and 
in many publiC buildings. Addi· 
tionally, federal legislation has 
been passed eliminating all smok-
ing in federal buildings. This is 
designed 10 protect othen from 
the negative effects of second-
hand smoke and also acts to 
reduce temptation for othen. 

"It is much easier for someone 

\

10 quit when the temptation is not 
there," said LuI:. Samaniego-

too much fun! 

AQUARIUS 
.fan. 20 - Feb. 18 

You've had it pretty good, but 
you'll have to put the brakes on 
soon. Playas much as possible on 
Monday and Tuesday. Wednes-
day and Thursday are good for 
counting your pennies. On Friday 
and Saturday, you'll learn quick-
ly. Cram your brain. The pace 
slows on Sunday. Resting at 
home's suggested for then.

You get stronger by Wednesday

Don't walk off and leave it some-

errands and relaxing. 

BIRTHDAYS

Oct. 19: This year put down 
roots and let love flourish . 

Oct. 20: Creative work is your

prising how hard it is! 

Oct. 21: Concentrate on serv-
ing others, and you will be served 
in return. 

Oct. 22: Move quickly, or you

Oct. 23: Your dreams could get

Oct. 24: You could win by los-

at UCSD Student Health Services. 
She hopes to abolish on-campus 
smoking as well as the sale and 
advertising of cigarettes, and insti-
tute comprehensive and student-
sensitive cessation programs. 

Some people, rather than quit· 
ting, try to reduce the harmful 
effects by switching brands or 
changing to light cigarettes. 
According to the National Cancer 
Institute's Executive Committee's 
report, this does little to reduce 
the risk of smoking. 

"The smoking of cigarettes 
with lower machine-measured 
yields (of tar and nicotine) has a 
small effect in reducing the risk of 
cancer caused by smoking, no 
effect on the risk of cardiovascular 
diseases and an uncertain effect on 
the risk of pulmonary disease." So 
switching brands or I'icking up a 
lighter cigarette will not make a 
significant difference in protecting 
smokers' lungs and bodies. 

Despite. these statistics, the 
pleasure of smoking continues to 
draw millions of people to light up 
every day. It is the hope of public 
officials that new legaf settlements 
with tobacco companies and new 
information regarding the harmful 
effects of smoking will persuade 
American youth to make intelli-
gent decisions regarding smoking.

As far as hope for another

goes, it is definitely not far from

The Tritons come into every

The women's volleyball team is 
out there excited, cheering each

time. 

"It was an 
emotional, high-

we still have a long 

way to actually realizing our 
potential. We've had some play-

season who are just now getting 
back into the mix of things. This 
team has a lot of strengths; it's 
just a matter of utilizing and tak-

" It was an emo·

McFarland said . " I was extreme·

of these girls. We sta rted off

excited . But I got them together 
and told them to settle down 
and play smarter. Juniata had a 
quick offense. All we needed 
was to calm down a bit and 
make a few defensive adjust-

they did .

Volleyball Continues Its Victory March 
REMATCH: UCSD defeats the team they beat to win the 1997 NCAA national championship 
lylHANTTHOMASIAN 
Staff Writer 

History has been known to 
prove many things true. 

In 1997, UCSD defeated 
Juniata College of Pennsylvania 
to win the Women's Volleyball 
Nahonal Championship. Both 
teams r:net again last year In the 
championship semifinals, 
and once a~aln, the 
women of 
U C S D 
showed their 
superiority 
and . determination by 
rallying from a 0-2 deficit, 
sending the Eagles of Juniata 
home for an early vacation. 

Will history play its role once 
again? This past Saturday, in 
front of a crowd of over 500 
excited fanatics showing their 
utmost support, the UCSD 
women's volleyball.team hosted 
the Eagles to yet another battle. 
Both teams came in with aston-
ishing records under their belts, 
UCSD with an amazing 19-1 
record and Juniata with a 20-3 
record . Although the Tritons 
were mindful of their successful 
history with Juniata, they never 
let tha t notion settle In their 
heads, nor did they take any-
thing out of their hard play. 

UCSD started off slowly as a 
result of the quick offense that 
J ""iata was displaying. After 
trailing 0-4 in the first set, Head 
Coach Duncan McFarland of 
UCSD called an early timeout in 
hopes of getting his squad 
together and back on track. 

Whatever it was that 
McFarland told the women in 
the huddle, it must have been 
brilliant, because it sparked the 

team UCSD to a phenomenal 10-
o run, which resulted in a come-
from-behind, 15-5 first-game vic-
tory for UCSD. 

The second set became a see-
saw battle to the end, with UCSD 
trailing most of the way. It final-
ly came down to a score of 14-14, 
which led to extra points. 

Both teams kept battling, 
switching from one side-

out to another. In the end, 
it was team 
UCSD that 
came up on 
top with a 

dramatic 17-15 victory 
in the second set. 

McFarland noted how impor-
tant it was to win the second 
game, because a loss would have 

_ been a step backward for UCSD, 
making it square-even once 
again and possibly shifting the 
momentum into the hands of 
Juniata. 

"We needed the second game 
to keep Juniata out of the 
ma!ch," McFarland said. "It was 
the deciding factor of w~ether 
the game belonged to us or if it 
was going down to crunch 
time." 

The third game started off 
close, but UCSD quickly took 
over and sealed the victory with 
a final, dramatic kill by Kathleen 
Hentz, easily defeating Juniata in 
the final game 15-7. 

What was thought to have 
been a vigorous, close match, 
actually resulted in a 3-{) sweep 
by the Tritons and another point 
to their win column, improving 
their record to an impressive 20-1. 

Led by the illustrious Allison 
Bender, who also led both teams

You guys are 
getting better 

The intent of this column, 
when I began writing it, was to 
portray bitterness. I wanted to 
get aggravated; I wanted to get 
intensely upset. 

Ever since I started this job 
I have had the same problem 
with you people. Our sports 
department does its job year in 
and year out, consistently 
putting forward one of the 
best Division-III programs in 
the country ... and they do this 
in spite of the fac t that it is typ-
ical for our opponents to come 
into UCSD and have a consid-
erably greater number of fans 
than ollr home Tritons do. 

I remember a water polo 
game I went to last year, in 
which the Tritons played UC 
Irvine. By the end of the game 
- a crushing defeat by the 
Anteaters - I felt like I had to 
sneak out of Canyonview like 
USC fans have to sneak out of 
the Rose Bowl after a defeat to 
UCLA. 

So the intent of this column 
was to get you riled up, to get 
you excited about UCSD ath-
letics ... but the truth is that 
now, I can't get angry. 

I was in the stands for the 
women's volleyball game 
against Juniata and I have to 
consider the turnout to be rela-
tively impressive. It should 
have been greater considering 
the fact that it was a Saturday 
night and the game was a 
rematch of the 1997 national 
championship game, but all in 
all, it wasn' t half bad . 

The rematch of the water 
polo game I went to last year 
was also this weekend. Not 
only did we have a positive 
showing at Irvine, we actually 
had more fans then the 

- Anteaters did in their own 
facility. As a result, instead of 
the lopsided defeat the Tritons 
took last year, UCSD upset the 
Anteaters in their own back 
yard . 

Folk-s, this isn' t a coinci-
dence. 

It's easier to play in front of 
a home crowd than no crowd 
at all, and it's easier to play in 
front of no crowd at all than a 
hostile one. A lack of crowds 
has always been a problem at 
UCSD, but I think the size of 
the audiences is actually get-
ting better. 

The key to enjoying this 
place is to step outside ~f the 
academics every once in a while 
and cut loose. Athletic events 
are the perfect place to do this. 
There is a direct correlation 
between the grumpy, introvert-
ed attitude of the typical UCSD 
student and the amount of total 
hours spent in the library 
studying Genetics. 

So instead of yelling at you 
(or doing whatever the text 
e<Juivalent of that is), I am 
praising you for your effort 
this weekend and I urge you to 
try and build on this week-
end's performance. AU it takes 
is a little time and an occasion-
al, "Go UCSD" to tum a close 
game into a whitewash Triton 

. tory. 

Tritons Defeat UC Irvine 
ANTEA1EJI.EA1ERS: The water polo team defeats UC Irvine for their second upset win of the season 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

UCSD is a good school as far 
as Division 1/1 athletics go. We 
were good enough to win the 
Sears Cup two years ago and to 
be joining Division II in a year. 
However, our success in 
Division 1JI has never translated 
into success against Division I 
opponents. 

With the huge amounts of 
money and resources that 
Division I schools' programs ded-
icate to athletics, it is hard to 
believe that UCSD could ever be 
victorious against one of the big 
Division I powers. 

Well, believe it! 
After defeating UCSB in the 

orCa I tournament last weekend 
for their first Division I win in 
over a year, the men's water polo 
team traveled up to UC Irvine 
this Saturday to take on the sev-
enth-ranked Anteaters. UC Irvine 
was playing only its second 
match in its new, $3.5 million pool 
facility. 

UC Irvine may want to consid-
er going back to its old, smaller 
pool- the Tritons dominated the 
game from the beginning, en 
route to an 8-7 upset victory. 

"We had tremendous crowd 
support and our guys played out-
standing defense," Head Coach 
Denny Harper said. "We proba-
bly outnumbered their fans 3-1." 

The Tritons started off with a 
bang, as they led 4-1 after one 
period and had all but shut down 
the high-powered Anteater 
offense led by two-meter man Jeff 
Powers. 

The next period was played to 
a standstill, as the two teams 
scored two goals. The Tritons 
were feeling good about them-
selves as they headed into the 
locker room with a 7-4 lead. 

The third period was also a sis-
ter-kissing affair, as both the 
Tritons and the Anteaters scored 
one goal. With one period to go,

the Tritons had preserved the 
three-goal lead that they had built 
in the fPt period. 

But in the fourth period the 
Anteater offense swung into high 
gear as it quickly scored 2 
goals to cut the Triton lead 
to one. The Tritons 
stretched the 
lead back to 8-
6 on a Ross

with 3:26 remaining, but 
John Dorfi of UC Irvine 
scored his only goal of the day 
with just under three minutes left 
to cut the Triton lead back to one. 

The Tritons maintained this 
lead until the final seconds of the 

game, when they held the ball 
and tried to run the dock. With 
five seconds left, the Anteaters 
gained possession and called 
their final timeout. 

UCSD's defense worked to 
perfection as the Anteaters 

were unable to get a shot 
off and the 
clock expired.

Mecham was 

clearly the player of the 
match, as he scored 6 goals, 

IIlcluding one of the two-point 
variety to account for seven of the 
Tritons' eight points. 

Mecham gave credit to two-
meter man Jonathan Samuels for 

two of his goals, as Samuels drew 
two four meter penalty shots that 
Mecham converted. 

In the cage, Glenn Busch was 
excellent, recording 10 saves for 
the Tritons. 

"I thought Glenn had a solid 
game," Harper said. "The defense 
was also excellent in front of 
him." 

After the victory, the Tritons 
are now an imprer..sive 15-6 on the 
season while the Anteaters fell to 
6-9.
