The University of California saw 
a record number of applications for 
Fall Quarter 2008, but in the shadow 
of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed $109-million cut to the 
university’s budget this year, the 
accommodation of all eligible appli-
cants remains a pressing challenge.

Overall, 121,005 students applied 
to the 10 UC undergraduate campuses 
this year, signifying a 9-percent increase 
over last year’s 110,994 applicants. In 
addition, there was an 8.5-percent 
increase in transfer student applica-
tions, compensating for what Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions and 
Registration Mae W. Brown considered 
to be a disappointing decline in the 
demographic in 2007.

UCSD’s applicant pool showed 
6.1-percent growth overall, with 
57,116 applicants, compared to 
53,845 last year. This year’s total of 
47,366 freshman applicants repre-
sents a 5.1-percent increase from the 
previous year’s 45,054, and transfer 
student applications rose to 9,750 
this year from 8,791 in 2007, mark-
ing a 10.9-percent growth.

UC Director of Admissions and 
Ethnic Media Communications 
Ricardo Vazquez said that in addi-
tion to record-setting totals — which 

have to put all the pieces of the 
puzzle together to have the kind 
of student life that people would 
like to see on campus,” Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Edward Spriggs said. “And the envi-
ronmental impact will be less severe 
in three years because car compa-
nies, like Toyota, are projecting that 
there will be five times the number 
of hybrids on the roads than there 
are now.”

Although convenient storefronts 
could lead the way toward the cre-
ation of a vibrant downtown atmo-
sphere for the UCSD community, 
students criticized the unfair impo-
sition of fees on those who may 
not even use the new Price Center 
facilities.

While the possibility of esca-
lating parking fees has prompted 
UCSD’s All-Campus Commuter 
Board to launch a campaign against 
the construction of another parking 
structure, several campus admin-
istrators defended the structure’s 
necessity to attract visitors to the 
nightlife ambience planned for 
ongoing Price Center expansion 
projects.

A.S. councilmembers greeted students

renewed attempts to expand face time with 
their constituents and raise awareness about

some of the council’s own members described 
as publicly stagnant.

UCSD has agreed to pay the Food Co-op 
more than $2,500 in rent abatement after a year-
long debate over financial hardships the group 
incurred when the Student Center construction 
breached the back half of the store last year.

From January through April 2007, co-op 
members lost access to their sink, restricting 
food preparation in the store’s kitchen. 

“It feels really good to have finally resolved 
this,” Food Co-op core member Molly Parent 
said. “It’s been an ongoing issue for us for a year, 
and it was really important to us that we hold the 
university accountable to [our space agreement]. 
It feels great for us to have it settled in our favor.”

Co-op core members were informed of 
UCSD’s decision to facilitate full rent abatement 
on Jan. 29 in an e-mail from University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino. The missive came after 
co-op core members spoke before the A.S. 
Council on Jan. 23 to request that the council 
mediate the debate. The chief concern of core 
members was UCSD’s apparent refusal to honor 
the space agreement contract arranged between 
the two parties.

students voiced concerns about the 
possible impacts of erecting such a 
structure on parking fees and how 
the increased traffic would affect 
the environment. However, the 
$45-million investment into Price 
Center’s expansion also entails 
bringing customers to the project’s 
new services, which include restau-
rants, a hair salon, a grocery store 
and a nightclub, by offering them 
ideal parking proximity.

If the proposed parking struc-
ture is approved next month by the 
Transportation Policy Committee, 
comprised of students, faculty and 
staff, plans to build the facility 
will begin immediately. The new 
structure is slated for construction 
on the northeast corner of Gilman 
Drive and Myers Lane and pro-
jected for completion during the 
2012-13 school year.

The A.S. Council’s programming 
department is shaking up its winter 
itinerary, scrapping the longstand-
ing WinterFest in favor of an event 
smaller in funding, size and name.

Assistant Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland said 
today’s Winter All-Campus Dance is 
not billed as a concert — an attempt 
by the office to distance itself from the 
consistently unsuccessful WinterFest. 
Of the department’s seasonal con-
certs, WinterFest, held annually at 
RIMAC Arena, regularly records the 
lowest attendance levels. 

Highland added that shrinking 
the event’s size would free up depart-
ment funds to accommodate other 
events, including the increasingly 
popular Bear Gardens.

“Because of continuously being 
unsuccessful, WinterFest was the 
obvious place where we could pull 
money from to fund Bear Gardens,” 
Highland said. “Over half of the 
[WinterFest] budget was cut and 
transferred to Bear Gardens.” 

Last year’s WinterFest was the first 
to be hosted in Price Center Ballroom, 
a precursor that programming aimed 
to downsize the event. That con-
cert attracted 1,200 attendees, down 
almost 50 percent from the previous 
WinterFest, which was held at RIMAC 
Arena.

“We could no longer afford the

months, and according to the master space 
agreement that we signed a couple years ago 
with the university, if there’s a utilities shut-off 
that lasts for more than four hours in a day, 
we should get full rent abatement for that day,” 
Parent said. “So, four straight months of no 
water should mean four months of rent free.”

Before the A.S. Council could form a com-
mittee to address the issue, however, council-
members were informed by campus officials that 
the university would be compensating the co-op 
with full rent abatement for the four-month 
period in question. Parent said the co-op’s move 
to take the issue before the council was likely an 
influencing factor in UCSD’s decision to settle 
the matter.

“It definitely showed them that we were 
willing to pursue it to the full extent that we did, 
and the fact that we were able to demonstrate in 
front of A.S. that we knew the MSA well enough 
to know how to pursue it I think gave us more 
credibility and indicated that they should look 
into it a little more carefully,” Parent said. 

University Centers Director Paul Terzino 
said in an e-mail that UCSD’s decison was a 
result of their unwillingness to let the issue grow

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

Rue’s Office Claims Prize 
as Tritons Get Gold

Complete with crown and trident, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue led her office to a first-
place victory in UCSD’s inaugural 
Spirit Week office-decorating con-
test, embodying a week of blue-and-
gold spirit that seemed to permeate 
the entire campus.

Upon entering Rue’s office, judg-
es crossed a barrier of butcher paper 
that proclaimed, “We’ve got spirit, 
yes, we do, if you’ve got spirit, run 
on through.” The UCSD fight song 
prefaced the recitation of a poem 
about Triton spirit that Rue authored. 
Everyone in the office was garbed 
with matching crowns and handmade 
tridents, and balloons and streamers 
completed what would prove to be 
an award-winning display. 

Thirty departments across cam-
pus participated in the contest, and 
after last week’s overwhelming suc-
cess, Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary Ratcliff said that he 
is already planning for next year.

Supreme Court Overturns 
Regents’ Fee Hike Appeal

The University of California 
acquired another financial obliga-
tion this week when the California 
Supreme Court ruled that it will have 
to reimburse thousands of profes-
sional students a total of $40 million 
for tuition fee increases during the 
2002-03 school year that violated 
the UC Board of Regents’ pledge to 
keep fees fixed.

Eight UC students filed the class-
action lawsuit, Kashmiri v. Regents 

of University of California, in San 
Francisco in July 2003 on allegations 
that fees had risen more than twice 
the amount the students were prom-
ised at the time of their acceptance. 

Recipients of the refund include 
9,163 law and medical students who 
enrolled before 2003, as well as over 
30,000 students who enrolled in the 
spring or summer of 2003. Lawyers 
estimated that individual payments 
will range from $100 to as much as 
$10,000.

UC Office of the President spokes-
man Ricardo Vàzquez said that the 
source of the funds has yet to be 
determined. However, he said that the 
university will no longer make written 
promises to not increase fees.

Campus Cancer Program 
Models New Care Standard

The National Institute of Medicine 
recently released a report outlining 
the often overlooked psychologi-
cal and social problems associat-
ed with cancer and proposing a 
new standard of care that mirrors 
the “Patient and Family Support 
Services: The Science of Caring” 
program at UCSD’s Moores Cancer 
Center.

The report’s recommendations 
include screening patients for dis-
tress, periodically re-evaluating their 
type of care and connecting them 
with service providers who have 
the resources to address long-term 
health issues.

The report recognized UCSD’s 
Science of Caring program as a 
model for the new standard of inte-
grated psychosocial health care 
and medical treatment that it hopes 
to implement nationwide.

acts that fill up RIMAC,” Highland 
said. “So it was a logical move to the 
ballroom.”

WinterFest 2007 did not manage 
to fill PC Ballroom to capacity, a 
letdown that Highland said he hoped 
to resolve with this year’s All-Campus 
Dance. The department is banking 
on the success of the Fall All-Campus 
Dance, a heavily attended event held 
at the beginning of every school year.

“From an event-planning per-
spective, it makes no sense to have 
just one All-Campus Dance each year 
because of the fact that it is so suc-
cessful,” he said. “The fall dance gets 
bigger and better every year, and I 
want to tap that success to produce 
more events that students will attend 
in large numbers.”

While the fall event featured DJs 
specializing in pop and Top-40 music, 
the winter variant of the All-Campus 
Dance will add a band lineup and 
“cutting-edge and artistically chal-
lenging” DJs, Highland said. The pro-
gramming department will establish 
the nature of future winter events 
based on how well this dance fares.

“If [the Winter All-Campus 
Dance] is a big success, I do not see a 
reason why it wouldn’t be continued 
next year,” he said.

This year’s event lineup fought a 
shakeup of its own, with the originally 
slated Los Angeles act Ima Robot drop-
ping out earlier this week. The pro-
gramming office’s Festival Coordinator 
Garrett Berg swapped the indie rock 
band, which backed out due to illness, 
for another: the Rx Bandits.

“Surely the fastest book this office 
has seen,” Highland said.

Councilmembers were lectured last night on matters both practical and philosophical. 
Two special presentations, one on park-
ing and the other on free speech, were 
the lead attraction.

Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services Brian 
d’Autremont spoke to the council about 
UCSD’s future transportation needs.

D’Autremont, who has a back-
ground managing parking at other 
UC schools, spun a web of student 
usage statistics, fee 
increases and sus-
tainability concerns 
to put a proposed 
new parking struc-
ture at UCSD into 
context. Although 
transportation ser-
vices are an innate-
ly uninspiring topic, d’Autremont man-
aged to do for parking what Al Gore 
did for climatology.

According to his projections, by 
2012 current parking facilities will be 
left with 400 to 600 open spaces dur-
ing peak usage. That sounds roomy 
enough, but d’Autremont said that 
hunting down spaces at that level would 
be considerably more time-consuming 
than it is today with more than 1,000 
open spaces at peak usage.

“It would be doable,” d’Autremont 
said sagely. Nonetheless, he recited a 
laundry list of solutions to maintain 
convenient parking on campus.

A 1,000-car parking structure was 
first up, weighing in at a cool $30 to $55 
million. The requisite parking permit 
fee hikes — up to $120 per quarter 
after the necessary increases — was 
unpopular with councilmembers, and 
d’Autremont moved on.

“I’m very very excited to talk to you 
about this,” he said of his second sug-
gestion, which was a regional transit 
pass for students.

“You could take any form of public 
transit anywhere in San Diego for free,” 
he said.

Expansions of free public transpor-
tation at other universities have taken 
1,000 cars off campus.

He also suggested a proposal to 
restrict future resident freshmen from 
parking on campus, a provision he said 
has been waiting in the wings for the 
last five years.

“So we have some good opportuni-
ties, some tradeoffs, but we have more 

hope than any-
where else in the 
UC system,” he said. 
“This university is 
better positioned 
than any other UC 
hands down.”

On that note of 
optimism, student 

representatives Tara Ramanathan and 
Carol-Irene Southworth from the sub-
committee to the campus free speech 
policy took the floor to discuss their 
efforts to reshape the free speech policy 
in a student-friendly way.

The pair reminded councilmem-
bers of the administration’s foiled move 
last June during finals week to revise 
the policy in ways that the ACLU later 
deemed unconstitutional.

They referred to provisions in the 
original policy that would restrict fac-
ulty participation in free speech activi-
ties, require organizers to reserve space 
and, most Orwellian of all, call for the 
deployment of so-called “demonstra-
tion monitors” to spontaneous demon-
strations. Ramanathan and Southworth 
made it clear that they were firmly in 
the camp of unregulated free speech, 
and presented a rough draft of their 
policy proposal.

The evolving proposal will even-
tually be subjected to the wrath of 
administrative review in the coming 
months.

resentative Sing Yi said. “It’s out of 
laziness. Money could be used to 
improve alternative forms of trans-
portation rather than building a 
new structure.”

All students at the forum echoed 
similar frustrations, urging that funds 
be allocated to the enhancment of 
existing transit types and parking 
policies. Suggestions included lim-
iting freshman parking to Regents 
and East Campus lots and making 
shuttle and MTS bus stops conducive 
to safety and rainy weather by adding 
better lighting and covering.

“It doesn’t make sense to build 
an entire structure so students walk 
five minutes instead of 15 minutes 
when there is vacancy on the outer 
areas of campus,” John Muir College 
sophomore Claire Luciano said.

The Department of Transportation 
and Parking Services emphasized 
the importance of investing in 
alternative forms of transportation 
to mitigate gas emissions and alle-
viate congestion in a cost-efficient 
manner. For example, the Regional 
Transit Pass, available this sum-
mer, enables all UCSD affiliates 
to utilize any form of local public 
transportation. Expanding alterna-
tive transportation options would 
reduce parking demands by 2,500 
to 3,000 spaces.   

“If we can get 1,500 people out 

of single cars with the Regional 
Transit Pass, we won’t even need to 
restrict freshman parking,” T&PS 
director Brian d’Autremont said. 
“Every dollar spent on alternative 
transportation has seven times the 
impact of every dollar spent on a 
parking structure.”

While implementing the RTP 

could cost more than $100,000, 
funding sources for the pass remains 
unclear until TPC votes on finance 
options next month. Possible sourc-
es include monthly charges or a 
referendum to raise student fees.    

With approximately 1,400 open 
parking spaces a day and an 80-
percent occupancy rate, UCSD’s   
parking accommodations are the 
best among all other UC campus-
es in terms of current occupancy, 
d’Autremont said.  

However, representatives from 
T&PS cited UCLA’s success in regu-
lating campus parking and trans-
portation options, such as park-
ing restrictions for freshmen, as an 
example that UCSD should follow.

“We can’t be compared to UCLA 
because of the city life surround-
ing them,” ACCB President Jerrod 
Zertuche said. “UCSD is in a dif-
ferent area and is pretty much iso-
lated.”

Increasing parking fees could 
deter students from purchasing 
permits, and erecting a new park-
ing structure could send the depart-
ment into a financial sinkhole, 
Zertuche argued.

As the ACCB continues to 
encourage students to petition 
against the structure on its Web site, 
the decision rests in the hands of the 
nine-person TPC. Still, d’Autremont 
said T&PS has a strong commit-
ment to alternative transportation, 
exemplified by the campus’ yearly 
reduction of single-car usage.

“Students like to mix and match 
their transportation selections,” he 
said. “Sometimes they like to take 
the bus and other times they drive. 
We want to provide more options 
so they can self-select according to 
their wishes.”

“a little slow” when the organizers 
were forced to move to the Price 
Center food court because of rain. 
When the weather improved later 
in the day, the group migrated back 
to Library Walk  for the week’s final 
event.

“I was surprised,” Murillo said of 
the Visibility Week activities. “A lot 
of students asked questions about 
how to get involved with A.S.”

According to Murillo, the pro-
gram marked the first time the 
council maintained a presence on 
Library Walk for three consecutive 
days. Past council “visibility” events 

have usually been 
one-day affairs.

Murillo said 
that the idea for 
a multiday vis-
ibility program 
first arose during 
council elections 
last spring. He 
wanted to recreate 
some of the excite-
ment and atten-
tion surrounding 
the council and 
its services that he 
saw during the two 

weeks of campaigning on Library 
Walk leading up to election day.

Murillo said that although the 
council succeeded in raising vis-
ibility early in the school year with 
a karaoke night that 300 students 
attended, he wants to “keep up that 
momentum” throughout the year.

The council will host another vis-
ibility week next quarter, according 
to Murillo. He said that he’d like to 
expand it to a five-day program and 
publicize it better in the future.

Young echoed Murillo’s senti-
ments.

“I think it’s a good start,” she 
said. “If students don’t know what 
we’re doing, then we’re not doing 
our job.”

on-campus polling stations and free 
T-shirts.

According to Vice President of 
External Affairs Dorothy Young, 
members collected more than 200 
registration cards. 

Young has led registration drives 
through her office over the 2007-08 
school year, but last week’s drive was 
unique because it was supported by 
members outside of the External 
Affairs Office. 

“This was an opportunity to show 
that it was an A.S. [Council] registra-
tion drive,” Young said. “I think hav-
ing other people 
brought in new 
students.”

On Jan. 23 
the focus shifted 
to promoting 
A.S. services. 
Councilmembers 
distrubuted free 
Chipotle burritos 
while signing up 
approximately 40 
students for A.S. 
Safe Ride and dis-
tributing infor-
mation about the 
“Dine with a Prof ” program.

President Marco Murillo said the 
free food also attracted more than 
100 students who filled out sur-
veys about A.S. services. The sur-
veys evaluated campuswide aware-
ness about the Academic Success 
Program, the UCSD Internet-based 
radio station KSDT and the council’s 
funding of student organizations, 
among other things.

“We wanted to gauge the opinion 
of students,” Murillo said, adding 
that he hopes the results will help 
direct the council’s publicity efforts 
and identify which services students 
use most.

Last week the council joined 
UCSD Cares in hosting a gift card 
drive for the victims of the San 
Diego wildfires.

Murillo said the drive started off 

agreement with UCSD afforded them 
full rent abatement. Administrators 
denied the request, offering instead 
a rent abatement of 50 percent for 
each month that the obstruction had 
occurred. Core members refused this 
offer and continued to pursue their 
initial request.

“It’s sort of been a year long pro-
cess of discussing this with University 
Centers, where they initially felt that the 
intent of the MSA was to only provide 
that if the shutdown forced us to close 
our doors entirely, but there’s no actual 
wording about that,” Parent said. “They 
offered us a 50-percent rent abatement 
during that time, but we opted not to 
accept that because it wasn’t what we 
agreed on in the space agreement and 
we wanted to have the grounds to pur-
sue full rent abatement.”

Parent said that co-op core mem-
bers are thankful for campus officials’ 
decision.

“We’re really grateful to them for 
settling it the way they did,” she said. 
“We really appreciate the administra-
tion for cooperating with us.”

any more than it already had.
“The Food Co-op had asked the 

A.S. [Council] to convene the co-op 
oversight committee, which is currently 
not operational, to arbitrate the matter 
and the difference between a 50-percent 
rebate and 100-percent rebate for the 
period amounted only to $1,304.25,” 
Terzino said. “Given the amount at 
stake, it did not seem like the best use 
of everyone’s time to convene the com-
mittee and delve into matter.”

A.S. Vice President of Student Life 
Donna Bean, who heard the co-op’s 
request at the Jan. 23 A.S. Council 
meeting, felt that UCSD was correct to 
offer the resolution that it did. 

“I think that they made the right 
decision,” Bean said. “There should 
be student-run businesses on campus 
that can survive, and they shouldn’t 
be charging them rent when they 
have no electricity and no running 
water to run the facility. It makes 
them look bad.” 

The debate first arose last year 
when co-op core members requested 
that they be compensated for the four 
months that they were without water, 
asserting that their master space

OPINION
EDITORIALS

Lana Blank is exasperat-ed — you could hear it in her voice at last week’s A.S. 
Council meeting, where the chair 
of the Thurgood Marshall Student 
Council was practically pleading 
with Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue. Her academic 
schedule, Blank said, would prohibit 
her from attending committee meet-
ings during which members would 
pick Marshall’s next dean of student 
affairs.

As one of three student represen-
tatives appointed to the committee, 
Blank was well aware of the impacts 
of her attendance (and nonatten-
dance). As the leading administra-
tive link between the university and 
its students, Rue was well aware of a 
bigger problem: “Only three?” Rue 
said, referencing the glaringly nomi-
nal number of students on the com-
mittee. 

The problem dove deeper as 
Blank spoke further. Student politi-

cians already wield a hefty academic 
workload, she said, and were not 
being appropriately accommodated. 

Blank’s troubles illustrate a larger 
problem that has escalated over the 
past year: Administrators are turn-
ing a cold shoulder to student rep-
resentation. Her scheduling snafu 
worsens an already dismal scandal 
at Marshall, where Provost Allan 
Havis first elected only two students 
to his selection committee, and some 
councilmembers declared one com-
mittee member unfit for the job. 
Havis then threw protesting TMC 
students a meager bone by electing 
a third student. That third student, 
however, is allowed minimal partici-
pation, joining only the final stage 
of discussion and left without voting 
powers.

Weeks before, councilmembers 
from Earl Warren College voiced 
protest about being improperly 
informed of plans to change general 
education requirements. The uproar 

was a month late, with an Academic 
Senate sub-body approving the pro-
posal 8-1 — the single dissenter was 
the committee’s only undergraduate 
representative.

Pertinent, student-related issues 
will continue to bypass the council 

unless representation is expanded. 
Blank and her councilmembers face 
a stark reality: Faculty and staff will 
tap the deans they want, approve 
the plans they like and meet during 
the times they can, until there are 
enough students to stop them.

I know — I caved. I signed up for Netflix, that glorious, $13-a-month program with no late fees and a 
seemingly unlimited selection of mov-
ies. You’re probably thinking: How 
could I be so gullible? So lazy? So 
cheap? 

To put it simply, because I can. 

Naysayers have said my decision to 
join “the other team” is analogous to 
music piracy because, in a sense, I am 
depriving “respectable” businesses of 
revenue, namely movie-rental stores 
like Blockbuster and movie theaters.

Please. 
First of all, I don’t know about you, 

but lines of people, exorbitantly priced 
Sour Patch Kids, ill-behaved infants 
and a $10 entrance fee are by no means 
my ideas of a good night. I mean, when 
it’s a new movie that I have been des-
perately wanting to see, maybe I’ll find 
within myself the resolve to brave the 
experience’s overall disgustingness, but 
more often than not I’d prefer to watch 
an older movie I haven’t seen yet in the 
comfort of my own home with family 
or friends. With Netflix, I can do this 
without even leaving my home. In a 
word: It’s genius.

And besides, certain members of 
my extended family have made their 
living from movies, so why would I 
sign up for something that would pur-
portedly compromise their success?

But all this talk about Netflix leaves 
me wondering: How do people make 
money from movies? We all know 
about the astronomical compensation 
scales that actors, directors and produc-
ers enjoy, including ludicrous percent-
ages of box-office sales, but these are 
usually the most visible moviemakers, 
so what about the theaters? Do they not 
get a slice of the pie? Is that why we pay 
so much to go see a movie?  

Per my film-savvy relatives, yes 
and no. In fact, once upon a time, 
movie studios used to operate their 
own theaters, reaping 100 percent of

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— The first waves of the UC sys-
tem’s 2004 update of its Long Range 
Development Plan are just now fully 
being felt, and with that comes the 
importance of charting the progress 
of the plan and its aims and direc-
tions. From a universitywide point 
of view, the LRDP has received 
mixed reviews, but thus far UCSD’s 
implementation of the plan has 
proven to be a paragon of university 

expansion.
First created in 1963, the LRDP 

is now in its fifth edition, and pre-
pares the university to accommo-
date any demographic changes that 
may occur through the 2019-20 aca-
demic year. The concept behind the 
LRDP is a good one: It is a far-reach-
ing plan that hopes to continually 
improve the UC system as a whole, 
particularly the educational experi-
ence that each student receives.

However, the LRDP’s major flaw 
is that it does not give campuses 
a detailed action plan for how to 
more forward with the LRDP. This 
essentially gives the UC Board of 
Regents a blank check, allowing 
them to spend money however they 
want in the name of progress. The 
document’s purposefully ambigu-
ous wording creates loopholes that 
allows the regents to abuse it, poten-

tially taking the UC system down 
a road that goes against the core 
principles of the enlightened nature 

of public education. 
During fall 2007, UC Santa Cruz 

found itself playing host to a major 
manifestation of corrupt regents’ 

policies via the LRDP. The uni-
versity had begun the creation of 
a brand new Biomedical Science 
Facility, conveniently located amid 
a beautiful, ancient redwood grove. 
Protesting students and organiza-
tions had no problem with the idea 
behind the building, but were out-
raged by the regents’ decision to 
ignore the environmental impact 
report that specifically discouraged 
the creation of similar complexes 
in the existing natural habitat. The 
ecosystem on the UCSC campus is 
a very delicate one, which spurred 
the EIR to caution the UC sys-
tem over disrupting it. The regents 
were blinded by the glory and profit 
that a new science structure would 
bring and pushed forward with their 
planned demolition of the redwood 
forest. 

A huge protest was held at the 

anticipated construction site — this 
rally wasn’t just a group of Santa 
Cruz hippies trying to protect the 
trees that they would have otherwise 
been hugging, but an outpouring of 
support by environmentally aware 
students who were enraged by the 
dishonest bureaucratic practices of 
the UC system. 

While peaceful lines of civil dis-
obedience formed around the red-
woods, Santa Cruz police let loose 
clouds of tear gas and arrested 
innocent students. This example of 
police brutality should draw atten-
tion to the regents’ wrongdoings 
and should act as a catalyst for UC 
campuses up and down the coast 
to mobilize against similar actions 
under the banner of LRDP progress. 
In dealing with UCSC’s LRDP, the 

Students Must Keep Regents in Check Over Long Range Development Plan

“The document’s purposefully ambiguous wording creates a loophole that 
allows the regents to 

abuse it.”

As UCSD expansion 
continues positively, the 
decades-old plan proves 
controversial at other 
campuses.

Theater 
Experience Not 

Worth Even 
the Popcorn

If this month’s three parking forums revealed anything, it wasn’t a pretty solution. It was 
difficult, if not impossible, to find a 
solution broad enough to solve the 
varied complaints thrown around by 
staff, faculty and students — every 
problem had some linkage to anoth-
er. Together, the three forums exem-
plified UCSD’s parking problem: It’s 
all one big mess.

Transportation and Parking 
Services’ recently released study 
poses a bleak picture to our cam-
pus. Its bottom line screams, “We’ve 
run out of room and money to give 
students convenient campus access.”  
The most impulsive of cure-alls 
would see the building of a multi-
story parking structure, a plan that 
would minimize land usage, expand 
available student parking and use 
increased fee revenues to pay for it 
all. But that model failed miserably 
at San Diego State University, where 
students scoffed at higher permit 
prices, sending the fund into a ditch-
deep deficit. A handful of UCSD 
brass, including members of the 
All-Campus Commuter Board, A.S. 
Council and administration, have 
rightly kept the idea at arm’s length. 
It is against the interests of students 
to have parking, but not enough gas 
money.

T&PS’ best answer to campus 
parking troubles is painfully mini-
mal: Don’t park on campus. Bike, 

bus or use any transit alternative 
that won’t take up the parking spaces 
that UCSD doesn’t have. Not exactly 
a student-friendly solution, but it’s 
the best detour T&PS Director Brian 
d’Autremont has identified so far. His 
regional bus pass proposal is per-
haps the only thrilling component; 
by allowing students entry to any one 
of San Diego’s diverse neighborhoods 
without cost, it has the potential 
to change UCSD’s local profile, and 
how the college’s students interact 
with the city around them. When 
d’Autremont arrived last year, he told 
the Guardian that he hoped to pri-
oritize and encourage sustainability; 
promotion of public transportation 
puts him a step closer toward fulfill-
ing that goal. 

Unfortunately, long-term pay-
back from sustainability will more 
immediately hurt students. With the 
amount of free parking slumping, 
freshmen may be barred from on-
campus parking within five years. If, 
by then, d’Autremont’s transit pass 
plan hasn’t taken shape, he’ll be left 
with unhappy students, nightmar-
ishly upset over the prospect of being 
trapped on campus.

This board supports any proposi-
tion that advances alternative transit 
and is locally tied. But the burden is 
on the campus’ parking department 
to correctly implement its plans, and 
that job won’t be easy. It will require 
a change in campus mentality, one 

that is already entrenched in the 
convenient habits of single-car com-
muting. An alternative to commut-
ing will have to be just as expedient, 
completely cost-free and thrown in a 
student’s face to even seem enticing. 
Vigilantly planned marketing and 
well-honed publicizing schemes are 
in order. D’Autremont must utilize 
every campus node to make his alter-
natives known, from every college’s 
resident dean to every dorm’s resi-
dent adviser.

The forums, although depressing 
in their complexities, offer the first 
of hopefully many open communica-
tions between parking officials and 
the increasingly dejected community 
they serve.

the profits (movie tickets at that time 
were 40 cents a pop). But of course, 
this all came to an end in 1948 when 
the Supreme Court formally ruled that 
studios divest themselves of their the-
aters. 

After this Great Movie Schism, as I 
will dub it, theaters started to look for 
other ways to bilk moviegoers out of 
ridiculous sums of money, and, believe 
it or not, they successfully devised a 
cruel machination that would come to 
be the business’ most lucrative venture 
— the concession stand. That’s right, 
every carton of popcorn, soda, box of 
Goobers or any other horrendously 
named confection that tickles your 
fancy is all part of a grossly profitable 
scheme that yields a profit of around 
90 cents on the dollar. As if that weren’t 
enough, theaters also have ways to keep 
people coming: that ungodly amount 
of salt found on popcorn is no accident 
— it keeps customers thirsty.   

Naturally, after concession sales, 
movie theaters are pretty good at, well, 
showing movies. Every deal is differ-
ent, but getting these movies onto the 
silver screen involves a great deal of col-
laboration with their erstwhile owners 
(studios) and working out deals from 
which both parties take home some 
dough. In most cases, it begins with a 
film booker, a middleman for studios 
and movie theaters, who leases a film to 
a theater for a given period of time. 

The stipulation is that, starting 
opening week, studios are entitled to 
70 to 80 percent of box office sales. But 
that percentage decreases with time, 
so after the fifth or sixth week studios 
end up only taking in around 35 per-

Concession Stands Theaters’ Real Breadwinner
▶ NOTA, from page 4 cent, leaving the rest to the theaters. In 

other words, movies have to maintain 
consistently numerous audiences (over 
several weeks) for the theater to make 
any money. 

Mega-blockbusters, like “Titanic,” 
that keep audiences coming for weeks 
on end are what studios and theaters 
dream of. 

Unlike the mind-bogglingly lucra-
tive concession stand, movie theaters 
tend to lose money when showing 
movies because most of the revenue 
earned from ticket sales goes directly 
to maintaining the theater (rent, utili-
ties and film leasing costs), staff sala-
ries (ushers, cleaners, projectionists, 
etc.), and who knew replacing projec-
tor lightbulbs cost more than $1,000? 
I guess those things aren’t mass-pro-
duced. 

Interestingly, pricey projection 
bulbs are the very reason why mov-
ies are always slightly out of focus (if 
you have even noticed that at all). As 
opposed to a perfectly in-focus movie, 
a fuzzier picture apparently reduces 
the risk of getting the film reel stuck in 
the projector, which would cause the 
bulb to break. So instead of having to 
hire more projectionists to make sure 
all the movies are crystal clear, the 
theaters resign themselves to shod-
dier film sharpness and save buckets of 
moolah. Hey, it’s a business.  

But now theaters are making a lot 
more money, this time independent 
of studios. The advent of in-theater 
advertising has really given studio 
bosses a run for their money, as every 
on-screen VISA or Coca-Cola com-
mercial (sometimes under the guise 
of insipid ‘trivia shows’) is yet another 

missed opportunity for studios to show 
previews of upcoming films (for which 
theaters get nothing, of course). 

With this in mind, movie theaters 
have on occasion deliberately trun-
cated the length of preview reels just 
to make room for their more lucrative 
commercial advertisements. With in-
theater advertising, theaters don’t have 
to go “halfsies” on the revenue with 
anyone, and advertisers are willing to 
pay a pretty penny for airtime. 

There’s no denying it, theater own-
ers are in a tough business; I certainly 
don’t envy them. But as Netflix, iTunes 
and other movie alternatives continue 
to flourish, the future of movie theaters 
is cloudier. Who knows, maybe one 
day movie studios will come up with 
a way to entirely obviate the need to 
go see a movie and create some sort 
of one-time-use DVD program. That 
said, theaters should develop more 
ways to compete in this uber-com-
petitive market and win over reluctant 
theatergoers such as myself. 

So while I’m at it, if theater brass are 
willing to hear, I’d like to suggest one 
way of making the moviegoing experi-
ence a lot more tolerable: criminalizing 
all in-theater cell-phone use, snotty 
teenagers, annoying infants and their 
negligent parents. 

Seriously, I lose all faith in human-
ity every time some toddler schmuck 
interrupts my movie with his or her 
unsupervised wails. In a just world, 
I’d probably throw my Junior Mints or 
something at them — but I wouldn’t 
want to have to get another $5 box of 
candy. 

Hell no. That’s exactly what the 
theaters would want. 

regents showed an utter disregard 
for the ideas and input of students 
and community members, and acted 
greedily in their own interests. 

Fortunately for UCSD students, 
the local LRDP has been quite suc-
cessful in sticking to students’ inter-
ests and looks 
thus far to accom-
modate the grow-
ing population 
without harming 
the environment. 
In drafting the 
San Diego char-
ter of the LRDP, 
administrators 
made sure to put 
in place land-
use limitations 
regarding the 
natural resources 
that already exist on campus. 

The maintenance of UCSD’s nat-
ural beauty will prove to be a huge 
issue while the LRDP attempts to 
expand the university to contain 
its ever-growing student population. 
LRDP projections assume that the 
student body at UCSD will jump 
to 32,700 by the year 2021, so the 
construction of new facilities and 
housing necessary to contain those 
large numbers will have to be done 
without tearing up the valuable sur-
rounding environment.

Similarly, the LRDP has projected 
that the sheer size of the UCSD cam-
pus will explode from 10.1 million 

gross square feet to an enormous 19.2 
million GSF over the next 10 years. It 
would be easy to destroy the remain-
ing natural areas on campus, but 
again, the UCSD LRDP must be com-
mended for its insistence on restrict-
ing any construction on the numer-
ous designated ecological reserves 

found around cam-
pus. UCSD has not 
only made a point 
to save its lands in 
the face of possible 
LRDP-sponsored 
bulldozers, but has 
also made stipu-
lations requiring 
the restoration of 
lands and parks in 
the area. 

The LRDP’s 
vague nature 
leaves room for 

malicious abuse by UC bureaucrats, 
but to date UCSD has avoided suc-
cumbing to the siren song of cor-
rupt LRDP policies and has set the 
standard for sustained development 
on all UC campuses. 

The UC system must retain its 
moral standing atop the mantel 
of public universities; in order to 
do so it must follow UCSD’s lead 
and guarantee the preservation of 
natural lands while continuing to 
expand and develop all other physi-
cal aspects of the university.

But the rising DJ — hail-

need much help to draw attention to 
his fresh brand of aggressive, pulsat-

Some original fare brings to mind 
his hometown’s beachy sass (see: 
“Shorts and Heels,” inspired by the 
styles of calf-flaunting chicas); oth-
ers, like “Hearts Revolution,” mesh 
Daft Punk-esque flair with excerpts 

of little Japanese girls 
squeaking foreign things  — 
very cool. Although he’s been known 
to experiment with sounds from 
the Knife, Chromeo and Ernesto 
Bastian, it’s his own work that hits 
the spot. Impressive talent, coming 
from a shaggy-haired, lesser-known 
Revolver resident.

Chances are, his act will steam up 
stages across the nation and the ocean, 
and he’ll be the next big thang — so,

For a more familiar whine, check 
out “In Her Drawer,” a straightfor-

hits every conceivable rhythm and 
tone  in their displaced subgenre. 
The group can’t seem to settle into a 
groove because it switched between 
unadulterated emo polish and Mars 
Volta-esque extravagance. 

No matter how you feel about 
the group’s questionable style, 
it’s hard not to appreciate the six

G et out your dancing shoes, ’cause this year’s Winter concert is techno-heavy. DJ duo L.A. Riots’ abrasive synth remixes rattle out the middle-end like Justice did so often last year with club bangers “D.A.N.C.E.” and “Waters of Nazareth,” 
until our speakers finally blew out from exhaustion. In a similar fashion, Lazaro Casanova 
— who sounds like “Crown trickling into a nice glass and the sound of ice blocks clink-
ing,” according to his MySpace — chops and glitches out dance singles from last year 
until they hurt your head. Both of these Daft Punk disciples mold former electro-shred 
into club gold on Thursday night; it could possibly make for a rave to rival Spring Quarter’s 
Sun God Festival.

something’s coming. Of course, nobody pays atten-
tion and the beat rages on. In contrast, the remix of 
Justice’s “The Party (feat. Uffie)” mashes and rear-
ranges any previous flow the original had, instead 
honing the beefed-up beats to accentuate Uffie’s 
scrambled musings on her typical club routine. 

Most likely, L.A. Riots’ set will combine their 
visionary mixes with straight-up techno and dance-
pop classics pulled from their choicest crates of vinyl. 
And how good can a dance party be without a freaky 
light show, complete with strobe and colored bulbs? 
Expect the whole color spectrum to unfold during the 
duo’s set. They’ve already rubbed up against dance 
greats, and their online mixtapes flow like a clubrat’s 
stream of consciousness after a few mixed drinks; all 
that’s left now is to create hits of their own. 

Nothing personal against the A.S. programming staff, but when it comes to hip-hop, the shows at UCSD over the past cou-
ple of years haven’t really been any-
thing to get hyped up about. It’s not 
so much that the previous shows 
here have been horrible, it’s just 
that there is too much raw talent in 
the hip-hop world to not have con-
sistently dope performances, espe-
cially since UCSD is so close to Los 
Angeles’ vibrant hip-hop scene. 

That should change this Friday 

Feb. 1, when Angeleno newcomer 
Blu performs at Porter’s Pub along-
side veterans Elzhi (one half of the 
classic group Slum Village, for those 
who don’t know) and DJ House 
Shoes. Blu, besides being one of the 
best rappers to emerge from the 
West Coast in the past five years, is 
a charismatic performer who treats 
the stage like his own basement and 
the crowd like homies. 

Blu’s debut album, with pro-
ducer/DJ Exile, was named the best 
hip-hop LP of 2007 by yours truly, 
and everything coming from the 

24-year-old rapper leads to the con-
clusion that it’s the start of some-
thing bigger.

One of the show’s more exciting 
aspects of the show is that it pairs 
fresh faces like Blu with experi-
enced heads like Elzhi and House 
Shoes. Elzhi is, from a technical 
standpoint, one of the best MCs 
rapping right now — his style is 
akin to what Big Daddy Kane was 
doing in the late ’80s in New York, 
but with an updated, Detroit-influ-

THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

By Edwin Gonzalez

A cinematic memorial dedicated to the altruism of American missionaries and Nazi busi-
nessmen nearly 70 years ago, the 
documentary “Nanking” recounts 
the grave World War II tragedy 
of the Japanese attack on Chinese 
soil. Directed by Academy Award 
winners Bill Guttentag and Dan 
Sturman, the film proclaims the 
saintly valediction of the few at odds 
with the meteoric devastation of 
wartime amorality.

After the Japanese invasion, the 
then-Chinese capital was declared 
a virtual open city — that is, chaos 
ran rampant. The aforementioned 
missionaries and businessmen, gal-
vanized by the horrors of the city, 
erected a refugee camp for those 
too poor to buy their way out. This 
safety zone was anchored by a trin-
ity of well-lit places — Bob Wilson’s 

hospital, Minnie Vautrin’s women’s 
college and John Rabe’s residence 
— and fortified in large part because 
of the warding color of the caretak-
ers’ skin. Whether the refugees were 
hounded by the Japanese infantry 
or severed from their families, they 
were able to find sanctuary in this 
forbidden two-mile stretch of city.

The letters and diary entries 
of those who set up the zone are 
personalized by actors Woody 
Harrelson as Bob Wilson, Mariel 
Hemingway as Minnie Vautrin and 
Jurgen Prochnow as John Rabe —

Your two impressions of Orson Welles are probably either 
that he was the groundbreaking filmmaker (“Citizen Kane”), 
or that he was a fat, drunk douche in commercials (see 
Youtube). What you probably don’t know is that he wasn’t just 
a one-hit wonder, proven with his 1958 noir gem “Touch of 
Evil.” Pre-NRA Charlton Heston is Mexican detective Ramon 
Vargas (oh, the sweet racial blindness of black-and-white 
film) who comes at odds with detective Harry Quinlan (Welles) 
over a murder in a seedy border town. Classic femme fatale 
Marlene Dietrich and legendary Janet Leigh add the woman’s 
touch to the psycho-sexual thriller, which features one of the 
most badass opening shots in the history of cinema. (CM)

Orange County’s suburban fortress isn’t exactly what you’d 
imagine for a burgeoning singer-songwriter’s creative garden, 
but Matt Costa found a way to launch melodic musings off his 
beachside youth with second album “Unfamiliar Faces.” Costa 
unabashedly harkens back to old-school pop-rock sensibilities, 
with lilting piano and guitar chords, personal yet approachable lyr-
ics and one hell of a knack at crafting a catchy refrain (just check 
out “Mr. Pitiful”). Delta Spirit opens the evening concert. (CM)

T here are two schools of thought to producing a Shakespearean play: There’s the contemporary adapta-
tion to keep modern audiences awake, 
and then there’s the uncompromising 
traditionalists who appeal to those 
few faithful aficionados. Director 
Andrei Belgrader jettisons both.

William Shakespeare’s dramedy 
“Pericles, Prince of Tyre” revolves 
around two central plotlines: the 
adventures of the titular prince (Josh 
Wade) and the misfortunes of his 
estranged daughter Marina (Liz 
Elkins). The play opens with a pro-
logue delivered by the poet John 
Gower (disguised, oddly enough, 
behind a costume reminiscent of 
Mike Myers’ “The Cat in the Hat”), 
in which young Pericles, fearing for 
his life, flees his homeland after deci-
phering the horrifying answer to a 
riddle issued by the King of Antioch. 
He journeys to the sea where, of 
course, mayhem ensues.

Insanity is an apt description for 

a production in which the direc-
tor seems to slam various genres, 
costumes and time periods together 
in a way Dr. Frankenstein would 
have envied. The play is a kaleido-
scope of slapstick, tragedy and even 
dance. Couple that with the extensive 
doubling-up of its actors (where the 
same person plays multiple roles) 
— quite common in Shakespearean 
plays — and the result is a slightly 
schizophrenic experience. But here’s 
the kicker: it works.

The simplistic, bordering on 
juvenile props that make the entire 
production seem like an advanced 
high-school play inject laughs into 
some otherwise dry scenes. Belgrader 
even goes so far as to bring backstage 
preparations to the forefront. 

One memorable scene portrays 
a shipwreck and an actor stripped 
to his skivvies in a small bathtub, 
while being systematically doused 
with buckets of water before sliding 
into the foreground on his stomach 
and lamenting about being washed 
“ashore.” Such techniques are sub-
tle reminders of the tricky balance 

between humor and heartbreak. It’s a 
juggling act, and somehow Belgrader 
keeps everything under control with 
fluid grace where lesser directors 
would have tripped.

But perhaps this harmony can be 
attributed to his strong cast mem-
bers, who carry out their seldomly 
peculiar performances with dedica-
tion and commitment. Elkins radiates 
an ethereal patience and innocence as 
Marina, and we understand why she 
is capable of bringing out virtue from 
the most corrupted characters. 

Jiehae Park and Joel Gelman, in 
multiple roles, manage to color minor 
characters with their eclectic and flex-
ible personalities, wardrobe, postures 
and, yes, strange accents. 

Commitment appears to be the 
production’s magic word. Belgrader’s 
creative visions are precarious and 
the smallest hesitation would have 
been catastrophic at best. But because 
the actors are so devoted to their 
characters, the audience is also able to 
commit to the absurdity and go along

rather on-screen interviews in real-
life personas. 

Aside from the actors, much of 
the film’s pathos comes from the tes-
timonies of now-elderly witnesses of 
the rape of Nanking, who have spent 
their lives tattooed with sanguine 
childhood memories of seeing their 
parents and younger siblings sav-
agely murdered. 

Mixing these fictional accounts 
of reality with the same integrity as 
its other, factual stories, the docu-
mentary illuminates the horror of 
the Asiatic Holocaust, previously 
marginalized by the Euro-centric-
ity of the traditional World War II 
narrative. 

The interwoven interviews 
coalesce with the black-and-white 
footage of planes’ aerial acrobatics 
in dogfights, the skeletal frames of 
buildings and the gory effects of bay-
onet wounds. For months, warplanes 
pelted the city into a prolonged 
demise until the capital resembled 
the black-and-blue bruises of its 
entrapped citizens. Thankfully, how-
ever, the film is not overly dependent 
on its repugnant reality, but empha-

Nada Surf
■ Lucky
BARSUK

T he 30-something indie-sap pop-pers of Nada Surf couldn’t have chosen a better title for their new-
est album Lucky, ’cause frankly, they’re 
lucky to even still be releasing anything. 
But then again, maybe their cockroach-
like ability to survive after the MTVed 
aftermath of “Popular” back in ’96 is 
the fact that they don’t defy cliches. No 
audacious attempts at something deep 
or meaningful in the lyrics. Nothing 
too funky or experimental in the instru-
mentals. No, Nada Surf is just there.

Could there really be something 
worthwhile about this band to let them 
outlive their original 15 minutes of 
fame? Well, yes and no. Yes, if you’re 

a 13-year-old girl finally reaching that 
time in life when you closet the boy-
band records and moves on to the 
harder stuff (relatively speaking). And 
no, if innovation is your thing.

With Lucky, these well-mean-
ing wimps recycle the tried-and-true 
themes of “love conquers all”, “we’re in 
it together,” “I’m my own man now,” 
blah, blah, drowning in a sea of cheddar 
over here. One would think that Nada 
Surf ’s lyrics would improve over time. 
Surely anything is better than the cho-
rus of “Popular”: “I’m never last picked/ 
I got a cheerleader chick.” As it turns 
out, no, they’re just as retarded as ever. 
Just look at Lucky’s sixth track, “Are 

You Lightning?”:  “Are you lightning?/ 
’Cause I’m waiting/ This is frightening/ 
I’m not playing.”  Or better yet, listen to 
the refrain of “I Like What You Say”:  
“You say, I like what you say/I like what 
you say/ You say, I like what you say/ 
I like what you say.” Well, at least the 
titles won’t mislead you.

A simple image of the nighttime sky 
is splayed across the album cover.  One 
can’t help but imagine the boys of Nada 
Surf driving out to the country, looking 
up into the heavens and counting their 
lucky stars.

Natasha Bedingfield
■ Pocketful of Sunshine
EPIC

B laming the young and impres-sionable for their own pop music indoctrination is too unap-
proachably circular. Instead, let’s 
blame Natasha Bedingfield and peo-
ple like her, or at least her marketing 
team.

Unabashed posturing for the sake 
of increased consumption number one: 
an “American” image. Bedingfield’s 
striving for soul in the voice and 
country in the big white hair and the 
big white teeth, but this lady was born 
in England. One of her higher-ups 
must have determined that, given the 
current climate, her Sunday-school 

style import was good enough to 
send back as is.

Unabashed posturing number two: 
content that suggests audience-com-
parable age and experience. Pocketful 
of Sunshine is blatantly engineered 
to resonate specifically with preteens 
whose hormones ensure both a mar-
ket for discussions of body image 
(“Freckles”, “Pirate Bones”) and a 
market for storybook semantics of 
eternal love (“Soulmate”, “Put Your 
Arms Around Me”) — or is it eternal 
“like”? The album’s appeal is so nar-
rowly directed that, when this near-
ing-30, mix-messaged figurehead 

breaks from being, yes, “in like” to 
offer a few lines about landlords and 
unemployment, these seem more out 
of character than others about tutus 
and plastic bazookas. 

But the power in the melodi-
cally moribund middle-school dance 
punch is that, on top of all of the 
noted misconstructions, Bedingfield’s 
marketing team still got her on “Ellen” 
this week and she still sang with 
enough sincerity to bump her up at 
least one notch on the top 20.

sizes the heroic story of its noble 
band, too respectful to mar their 
portrayal by political propaganda. 

As one missionary notes, the sal-
vation of Nanking was not reliant 
on national guards or national gods, 
but sprang from the compassion 
of those willing to sacrifice them-
selves for what is right. Venerating 
these virutous saints, Guttentag and 
Sturman excavate the historical path 
to Nanking and follow it through; 
the only aspects that are in their 
control are the editing and acting, 
revealing a modest level of crafts-
manship in both areas. 

The film isn’t grand or exagger-
ated, but then again, neither are 
the long-forgotten actions of those 
honored.

Ending on the current visage of 
Nanking recuperated in bandaged 
civic garb, we are able to recognize 
the city for what it once was. No 
longer scarred by Japanese occupa-
tion, it has been given new life that 
only sanctuaries are capable of pro-
viding in endangered hours. And a 
footnote of World War II history has 
been given the chapter and applause 
it rightly deserves.

Hot Chip
■ Made in the Dark
EMI

I f an album’s sound is indicative of how much booty the artists are going to get, then Hot Chip’s third endeavor, Made in the Dark, will 
score these geeks a healthy helping of poontang. 
The record bounces between sweet love ballads 
and powerful club mixes in a seamless balance 
of frivolity and synth, with money-makers like 
“Ready for the Floor” tearing up the speakers. 
The repetition of “Do it do it do it do it do it 
now” rings out like a command in the night, a 
command to shake your thang.

Filled with keyboard tinkering, samba beats 
and the keen call of frontman Alexis Taylor, 
most of the songs coalesce into infectious bits of 
electro-pop. They call to the carefree kid inside 
all of us, the one from the early ’90s who used 
to watch “Saved by the Bell” and laughed at 
Jessie Spano when she had that caffeine-induced 
breakdown. 

But these snarky kids are all grown up and 
coming strong with the lyrics. Their rap rep-
artee is witty as hell, especially in ditties like 

“Wrestlers” where they dish out a bitch fight; 
“So why’d you go and have to fight dirty?/ Don’t 
fight dirty, don’t bite me in the face.” 

At first, the droll ballads fade into the shad-
ows of the heavier dance-rock tracks. But on 
the second or third go-round, the seemingly 
meeker songs stake out an earnest beauty with 
serenades like “We’re Looking For a Lot of 
Love.” The track’s dreamy quality and echoey 
sadness are reminiscent of a somewhat-less-
depressed Postal Service.

But the rump-shakin’ continues after the 
umpteenth listen and the slower ballads dig a 
little deeper into that techno-loving center of 
your brain. Even when Hot Chip slow it down 
a little too much, as in “Made in the Dark,” they 
quickly regain their footing and pump out more 
energetic ingenuity. Made in the Dark easily 
makes any party playlist, to be put on repeat.

CAPITOL

Louis XIV
■ Slick Dogs and Ponies
ATLANTIC

B ritish accents are fucking awesome. Of course, this is predicated on the assump-tion that you actually hail from its isles, 
and not a San Diego suburb. But hell, if the 
boys of Louis XIV won’t try and fool you with 
their fake, Limey-coated vocals atop overtly 
sexual lyrics on sophomore effort Slick Dogs 
and Ponies. 

The quartet returns to the familiar wannabe-
classic-rock territory of their debut album, The 
Best Little Secrets Are Kept, with all the trap-
pings of a Stones, Bowie and T-Rex tribute 
band plowing the field for every coy attempt at 
sounding naughty. They waste no time getting 
down with opener “Guilt By Association,” in 
which haywire frontman Jason Hill asserts that 
“You don’t have to do the crime/ To serve the 
time,” over punctuated Franz Ferdinand-lite 
guitar spurts and drums that dream of being 
used in a DJ’s killer remix.

Virtually every song follows a similar pat-
tern with a few catches, like the absurd guitar 
feedback on “Swarming of the Bees” or the 

ego-fueled chorus in “There’s a Traitor In This 
Room” (featuring revealing lyrics “Who do you 
appreciate?/ Me, me, me, me, me!”). It’s not to 
say they lack talent — laidback rocker “Tina” 
hits the dance groove more smoothly then its 
frenetic brethren, and nine-minute “Hopesick” 
shows (God forbid) a little depth. 

Even the melodically glam “Air Traffic 
Control” feels genuine before you realize it’s 
just a Fischer-Price rendition of David Bowie’s 
“Space Oddity” — painstakingly lazy with a 
cookie-cutter approach to danceable rock-
n-roll songwriting. And although there’s a 
decent gel between the breakneck songs and 
the lower-key numbers, at the end of the day, 
it all comes down to the British accent and 
concealed cock-rock gimmick. 

We get it; you really wanted to hold Mick 
Jagger and Marianne Faithfull’s hair while they 
did a line of magic blow in 1969.

Y ellowcard may be best remembered as the squeaky-clean pop-punkers who took a multi-million dollar stroll down Ocean 
Avenue in 2003, but their newest iTunes exclu-
sive release proves that these romantics can 
flex enough meaty musicianship to warrant 
mainstream success. 

The live Las Vegas performance is a series 
of rising harmonies tightly wound to unremit-
ting reserves of irresistible energy. You’ve gotta 
give the guys credit — they’re damn fun to 
listen to, and they’re flawlessly poised in the 
upper echelons of the pop elite. 

The live album combines everything 
that’s made Yellowcard a guilty pleasure for  
Californians rocking out in traffic — main-
ly, those sky-high, sparkling power ballads, 
complete with lovesick screaming. The pitch-
perfect frontman Ryan Key wouldn’t be so 
compelling, though, without the persuasion of 
violin-wielding Sean Mackin, furiously sawing 
his bow to make refrains like, “Just let go, but 
keep it inside” that much rosier. 

Yellowcard has slickly honed a place in the 
melodramatic, anthemic genre of music, too 
often known for sappy dumped kids whining 
in their mom’s basement — but, as this live 
recording proves, kids don’t stay kids forever. 

This seems to be Key’s message as he rips 
head-banging chords over the shrieking Las 
Vegas crowd of doting tweens, confidently pro-
claiming that his purpose is to ensure that they 
“have the best rock-n-roll show” of their lives.

A lofty claim; but as the spotless drum-
ming climbs to impossible heights, and Key 
breaks into “The Takedown” without missing 
an urgent beat, his claim seems feasible. 

The Floridians follow up with a sequence 
of familiar tunes off their older albums (Ocean 
Avenue, Lights and Sounds), throwing in a few 
from their newest endeavor, Paper Walls — but 
not without giving fair warning: “A lot of you 
aren’t going to know how they go or what the 
words are.” The solution? “Go to the bar, take 
a shot, and come back … the more you drink, 
the better we sound.” 

But apart from the likelihood that 75 per-
cent of their audience is underage, a slug of 
whiskey ain’t necessary to get excited about 
Yellowcard’s sharpened sound. They may not 
have any surprises up their sleeves, but — live, 
or prerecorded — they’re good at what they do. 
The violin doesn’t hurt, either.

enced style. His work with partner 
T3 as Slum Village has been con-
sistently solid and, at best, has pro-
duced classic moments for modern 
hip-hop, even though mainstream 
radio has generally failed to recog-
nize their importance and quality. 

When I say “their,” House Shoes 
is definitely included. The Detroit 
hip-hop scene is closely knit; speak-
ing about one MC tends to spark 
discussion about other artists in the 
city, and few people from Detroit 
have their hands in as much music 
as House Shoes. 

This cat has built his reputation 
on only supporting quality music, 
while always having an eye out for 
the next shit. Currently, he’s opening 
up for Detroit bigshots like Guilty 

Simpson and Dilla’s little brother, 
Illa J.

The DJ spins phenomenally well 
too, spending more energy on the 
selection of the tracks he’s going to 
spin than focusing on the cut-cut-
scratch-cut aspect that many people 
associate with hip-hop DJs — in 
reality, it’s only worthwhile when a 
selected few experts do it. 

Trust me: you don’t want to miss 
this show. It’s free for students and 
nonaffiliates alike, and San Diego’s 
own DJ Norm Rocwell and the 
homie DJ PWC fill the opening 
slots. This is some of the best music

“Pericles” is one of Shakespeare’s 
minor works for good reason: the 
storyline is choppy, the dialogue bor-
ders on crude and the play hinges on 
a series of awfully convenient events 
to reunite father and daughter. But 
despite idiosyncrasies, it has an inher-
ent sweetness, wisely reinforced by 
Belgrader’s artistic guidance, that 
makes it all go down just a little 
easier.

he attributed to increased high 
school graduation rates, a growing 
number of students meeting the 
university’s eligibility requirements 
and the university’s new programs 
and facilities — the rise in black and 
Latino applicants at both the fresh-
man and transfer levels is promising. 
Reflecting systemwide trends, the 
number of black applicants at UCSD 
increased by 2.2 percent from last 
year, and the number of Latino appli-
cants showed a 7.7-percent increase.

Vazquez said this year’s applica-
tion statistics are overwhelmingly 
positive, but he said the university is 
frustrated that the success comes at 
a time when it faces such daunting 
financial circumstances.

“We are delighted to see such 
strong interest,” he said. “But these 
application numbers, while very pos-
itive and very welcomed, illustrate 
the difficult budget situation we are 
in today. Just as the demand reaches 
an all-time high, the university’s bud-
get gets cut by over  $100 million.”

The governor’s 2008-09 bud-

Director: Timing of  Applicant Surge a Mixed Bag 
▶ ENROLLMENT, from page 1 get proposal includes a 7-percent 

increase to the educational fee, a 10-
percent increase to the registration 
fee and a 10-percent reduction in 
administrative spending. 

However, the remainder of the 

reduction — which falls $400 mil-
lion below the UC Board of Regents’ 
request — is left to the university’s 
discretion.

Vazquez said Schwarzenegger 
suggested a 5,000-student increase 
in UC admission offers with the 

goal of increased collection of tuition 
revenue. While this appears to be a 
reasonable solution on the surface, it 
is crucial that the university closely 
examine the potential impacts of 
accepting more students than it can 
afford, Vazquez added.

“Our goal is to try to offer a 
place for every eligible student, but 
we have to look very soberly at our 
options,” he said. “Taking students 
without adequate funding will force 
us to cut funding in programs, which 
will end up hurting the very students 
we are trying to support.”

Vazquez said that although the 
university is wary of reducing admis-
sion rates — and ultimately, existing 
programs — in order to ease finan-
cial burdens, the option is currently 
under discussion.

He said the university plans to 
make a decision within the next 
couple of weeks regarding the num-
ber of students it can realistically 
support.

UCSD Post it BOARD



14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 2008

simply analyzing numbers, a better 
litmus test for student participation 
in school sports are the attendance 
trends regarding the performance of 
individual teams. 

It is a common generalization 
that UCSD fans have somewhat 
fair-weather attendance tendencies, 
choosing to only go to games that 
are very popular, and only to watch 
teams that are performing well. Last 
year, the men’s water polo team made 
it to the national semifinals, and the 
attendance at 2006 home games was 
a very good indication of students’ 
pride in the team and their dedication 
to supporting the winning squad. 

This season, however, the team 
was significantly less successful, yet 
attendance actually improved, with 
home games averaging 1,106 fans per 
game. One possible explanation for 
this is that, with students now shell-
ing out more money a year toward 
athletics, they have decided to take 
a more active role in supporting the 
Triton community. 

Similar trends were seen with 
many other teams in the last year, a 
possible sign that paying the extra 
$71 a quarter toward the athletics 
department has led many students 
to become more avid fans. Men’s 
volleyball posted three of its top 
10 single-match attendance figures 
in 12 years at RIMAC last season, 
including a team record attendance 

of 847 versus UCLA. In December 
2007, the men’s (1,121) and women’s 
basketball (702) openers both had 
their largest ever Fall Quarter atten-
dance figures, according to Grosse. 

While large crowds create a better 
sense of school spirit and communi-
ty among the student body, they also 
provide a huge boost to the athletes 
themselves.

“It’s always good to see the sup-
port and it always pumps us up for 
the game to see that the student body 
is behind us; we always love people 
coming out to watch us,” sophomore 
guard Annette Ilg said. “[For games 
where there a not a lot of fans] it just 
means that we need to be louder and 
support each other as a team but it’s 
definitely more fun when there is a 
crowd.”

Even though the occasional 

Triton home game is heavily attend-
ed, the majority of the events go 
unwatched, and all Triton teams and 
athletes have to deal with a lack of 
support that competing schools do 
not. The UCSD baseball team, for 
example, is coming off its best sea-
son in school history and is ranked 
15th nationally in the preseason poll 
— yet its home games usually count 
more people in the dugouts than in 
the stands. 

“It’s tough to show up day after 
day and not see a lot of support,” 
sophomore pitcher Kirby St. John 
said. “It just makes it harder to play 
the game with a lot of intensity. We 
do the best that we can and we do a 
good job of it, but it definitely is a 
big advantage to go to your games 
and have a bunch of people in the 
stands rooting for you. It is hard to 
represent a school that doesn’t really 
support you.”

Only time will tell whether the 
UCSD student body will use its refer-
endum increase as a catalyst to boost 
attendance, but for now it is clear 
that some improvement has taken 
place in the last year. But the turnout 
at Triton home games still has much 
improvement ahead of it to fully live 
up to the motto of Triton sports as 
“a proud tradition of athletic excel-
lence.”

on himself to change UCSD’s second-
half fortunes. 

“I was just thinking of being aggres-
sive tonight,” he said. “Everyone was 
setting good screens, and I had a guy 
that I felt I could get some points on.”

An active Allard was on display 
as he opened the second half with 
a jumper to pull UCSD within two. 
The four-year starter from San Jose 
scored 12 of UCSD’s 36 points in 
the second half, including six of the 
first eight. 

With 10 minutes and seven sec-
onds left in the game, junior for-
ward Henry Patterson’s free throw 
tied the game for the Tritons for the 
first time since the opening min-
utes of play. Just over three minutes 
later, junior guard Alan Husted hit 
two from the charity stripe to give 
UCSD its first lead of the game. 
Able to play stingy defense and take 
good care of the ball offensively to 
avoid turnovers, the Tritons would 
not trail through the rest of the 
game and avenged an earlier loss 
this season at Grand Canyon by the 
same margin.

“In the second half we took away 
their post game more,” said Allard, 
who scored a team-high 21 points 
and dished out a game-high three 
assists. “We were doubling the post 
more aggressively, everybody was 
rotating, and I think the defense 

really stepped it up. For me, it’s 
really about whatever is going to 
help us win. If for one night that 
means passing it to Henry or Jordan 
or whoever has the hot hand that 
night, I’m more than happy to do 
it. I’ve been around here for four 
years, and I’d much rather win than 
anything else.”

The Tritons finished the game 
with only six turnovers, compared 

to 12 assists and eight steals. The 
Antelopes committed 20 turnovers, 
compared to only six assists, as Rudy 
Bogan led the team with 23 points, 
six rebounds and matched UCSD 
on his own with six turnovers. The 
Tritons committed only two fouls in 
the second half and converted 65.2 
percent of their field goal attempts. 
Patterson and Kim each scored nine 
points in the game, with Kim also 
stealing three passes. 

“This was one of those games 
where we wanted it more, especially 
in the second half,” Carlson said. 
“We’re going to get everyone’s best 
every night. It was the same tonight. 
We weren’t at our best tonight, but we 
found a way. Sometimes you’re not 
going to be at your best, but you’ve 
got to find a way to grind it.”

The Tritons will now look to 
break their conference losing streak 
when they face Chico State on Feb. 
1 at 8 p.m. and Cal State Stanislaus 
on Feb. 2 with a scheduled 7:30 p.m. 
tip-off.

UCSD Ends Skid With Comeback Win

we need to work on. We’ve just got 
to push all that other stuff away and 
come to the court ready to play.” 

USC had mixed results last week-
end when it beat rival No. 4 UCLA 
but lost to No. 9 UC Irvine. The 
Trojans are led by senior setter and 
co-captain James Killian who is a 
four-year starter for the team.

“I haven’t watched tape on [USC] 
yet,” Ring said. “They’re a really deep 
team with some strong freshmen 
playing with them. The question we 
need to answer is if we can play with 
a lead and pull out of a game and go 
from there.” 

Still on the mind of the young 
Triton squad was last year’s upset of 
a the then-No. 14 Trojans. UCSD 
knows what it feels like to conquer 
such a strong team and Spangler said 
that the team is looking for a repeat.

On Jan. 30 the Tritons tried to 
fine tune their game with a non-
conference match against Princeton 
before heading into the big weekend. 
UCSD had won the last nine match-
ups between the two teams, and not 
much changed as the Tritons tamed 
the Tigers 32-30, 24-30, 30-22, 30-
27.

Although the Tritons looked fluid 
in game one, they struggled a bit in 
game two. However, Princeton’s five 
returning starters couldn’t lead the 
Tigers and UCSD came together in 
the final two games of the match.

“[Princeton] had a lot of serv-
ing and hitting errors compared to 
only 11 for us,” Spangler said. “They 
didn’t’ stop fighting all four games 
and they got us in that second game. 
But we just kept battling and it went 
well.”

Spangler led the Tritons in the 
match with 23 kills, while sophomore 
opposite Frank Fritsch contributed 
17 kills of his own. Sophomore mid-
dle blocker Gerald Houseman added 
4 aces to round out the effort.

Last week, the Tritons suffered 
back-to-back losses to Hawaii in 
Honolulu in front of crowds exceed-
ing 2,500. UCSD came close in both 
matches, falling 25-30, 30-27, 25-30, 
27-30 Jan. 23 and 25-30, 24-30, 30-
28, 30-27, 7-15 Jan. 25. 

Down by five in game one of the 
first match, Hawaii scored 16 of the 

next 22 to steal the game. After cap-
turing game two, the Tritons suffered 
the fate that has followed them all 
season — they had late game leads 
but were unable to get the runs when 
they needed.

mcroskey@ucsd.edu.

Strahan is your second-best defen-
sive lineman after Osi Umenyiora, 
obviously you’re in good shape. 
That front line, along with line-
backer Antonio Pierce, helps negate 
problems in the secondary and force 
bad throws that even an old guy 
like Sam Madison 
can get to some-
times. However, 
anyone who thinks 
Eli Manning went 
from troubled 
starter to future 
legend in two 
months is truly 
fooling them-
selves.

It would be 
surprising for me 
to see all these 
upset predictions 
heading into the 
game if not for the fact that much 
of the country has grown to hate the 
Patriots, and maybe the Boston area 
in general. Still, drawing a compari-
son between the underdog Giants 
and favored Patriots this year and 
the underdog Patriots vs. favored St. 
Louis Rams four years ago doesn’t 
really work.

First of all, Mike Martz isn’t 

coaching the Patriots, so they obvi-
ously can’t fall that quickly. Plus, 
with all of the mind games Belichick 
has played, don’t you think he’d 
take the time to remind his team 
about that game? Don’t you think 
he’ll be smart enough to downplay 
their accomplishments and play up 

the fact that this 
“dynasty” has 
won three titles 
by a combined 
nine points? 

M a n n i n g 
has had a great 
playoff run and 
might put on 
a good show-
ing at the Super 
Bowl, but Jake 
Delhomme did 
that in Super 
Bowl XXXVIII 
and the Patriots 

still came out on top, with a little 
help from John Kasay’s crappy kick-
off. So, it is with great confidence 
that I predict a Patriots victory, 
without even requiring any sort of 
spy equipment to do so. And if, in 
fact, I’m wrong, I’ll never have been 
happier to see my perfection come 
to an end.

HOT CORNER

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After its second 
weekend in the past three weeks of back-to-
back overtime games, a Tuesday night game 
against a regional opponent might not have 
been what the UCSD men’s basketball team was 
hoping for. Still, after a 
slow start, the Tritons 
showed the energetic 
play that they will need 
to carry them through 
the second half of the 
season, ending a two-game skid with a 62-52 
win over visiting Grand Canyon University on 
Jan. 29. The win put UCSD over the double-
digit plateau with a 10-6 overall record.

Head coach Chris Carlson’s Tritons found 
themselves in a hole early against the Antelopes, 
scoring only seven points through nearly 10 min-
utes of action and piling up eight missed shots 
and two turnovers. Senior guard Clint Allard, the 
conference leader in assists and UCSD’s second-
leading rebounder, took the lead offensively mid-
way through the first half. Two three-pointers and 
a lay-up from Allard, along with a three-pointer 
from junior guard Kelvin Kim, gave UCSD an 
11-2 run that cut Grand Canyon’s lead from 13 to 
four. The two teams traded baskets over the final 
five minutes with GCU maintaining a slim four-
point lead heading into the break.

The narrow gap was even more impressive 
considering the Tritons shot only 39.1 percent 
from the field in the first half, compared to 63.2 
percent field-goal shooting for the Antelopes.

“We hadn’t shot the ball real well in the first 
half, and that was a key going into the second 
half,” Carlson said.

While usually a tablesetter, Allard also took it

This past weekend showed two polar opposites of atten-dance patterns at UCSD home games. For Spirit Night on Friday, almost 4,000 students showed to support 
the Tritons as they took on the San Francisco State Gators. 
The lively crowd proved as a great sixth man for the basketball 
teams, willing the women’s squad to a quality win and doing 
all it could to help the men seek out an overtime win. For 
as much energy as there was on Friday, the following night 
saw the attendance return to normal — barely a few hundred 
people watched the games versus Cal State Monterey Bay.

“It’s very frustrating coming from Spirit Night last night to 
seeing the poor turnout for tonight’s game,” Senior Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse said. “But I think that there are 
a lot of things that go into that. For instance, Spirit Night is 
always on a Friday and we get a lot more students out on that 
night than on Saturday. Also, we always push both the men’s 
and women’s teams so that usually means that students will 
have watched five hours of basketball the night before, so 
coming back the next day with midterms around the corner 
always helps draw a lot less people to these games.”

With the one-year anniversary of the sports referendum fee 
increase approaching, it becomes a crucial time for reflection 
on the past 12 months and speculation on the future imple-
mentation of the new funds.

A single year of data is not enough to compare and con-
trast last year’s attendance figures with those from this year, 
because the timing and scheduling of home games changes 
every year and is thus incomparable. This year, many UCSD 
teams played a majority of their games during university vaca-
tions, leaving their home events mostly unattended. Instead of

UCSD Gears Up for Grueling Weekend

Super Bowl XLII: Pats’ Perfect Situation

And so, it’s come to this. Some thought it was possible, but most doubted. There were missteps, close calls, even 
a lack of confidence. However, the possibility 
of perfection has now become clear.

Yes, it’s true. After a long, tough battle, the 
time has finally come for the final Super Bowl 
prediction article from the Cup O’ Joe, and 
indeed, perfection is in sight.

It began innocently, picking a team I 
despised (New England Patriots) over a team 
that had just lost way more big games than 
they had won (Philadelphia Eagles). The 
Seahawks-Steelers match-up the next year was 

a little tougher to predict, forcing me to go 
back and forth between the teams, but I ulti-
mately made the right call. Last year, it would 
have been nice to pick an upset, but everyone 
outside of Chicago knew 
better, or should have, and 
so the Colts were an easy 
pick.

Of course, more atten-
tion this year is obviously 
being paid to the New 
England Patriots’ 18-0 
record than my own 3-
0 Super Bowl prediction record. Both are 
remarkable in their own right, but unfor-
tunately only one was deemed important 
enough to be covered by ESPN and have 
Roman numerals placed after it.

There’s really no reason to dissect the 
Patriots as a team. They are strong in every 
area. Even where they should be weak — as 
was assumed they’d be at cornerback after 

Ty Law left three years ago — they’re able to 
plug and play middle-round picks and still be 
better than everyone else. Individually, much 
of their defensive and offensive lines are noth-

ing special. Together, they 
are all extremely annoying. 
I’m not sure if Bill Belichick 
made Tom Brady or if Brady 
made Belichick. The only 
thing I know is that had 
they not found each other, 
I wouldn’t know who Gisele 
Bundchen is or have this 

desire to burn all my hooded sweatshirts.
The New York Giants, while obviously the 

B-story of the Super Bowl, deserve attention 
and credit for their 10-straight road wins. 
They’re not dominant in any sense of the word, 
but they have a punishing defensive front that 
is able to get to the quarterback. If Michael

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After 
suffering back-to-back losses last 
weekend in Hawaii, the No. 15 
UCSD men’s volleyball team faces 
a full schedule this week with 
three matches in four days, and 
two coming up against Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation foes.

With an overall record of 3-
5 and a 1-5 MPSF record, the 
Tritons are looking to rebound 
from their Hawaii trip and regain 

the form they displayed against 
UC Irvine just two weeks ago. 

“It feels good to be back at 
RIMAC,” sophomore outside hit-
ter Jason Spangler said. “We’re 
playing well right now and we 
have positive thoughts heading 
into the weekend like we always 
do.

UCSD will face No. 5 
Pepperdine on Feb. 1 and No. 
11 USC on Feb. 2. Last year the 
Waves captured both matches 
against UCSD, while the Trojans 
and the Tritons split their respec-
tive matches.

Spangler said that there is no 
reason that UCSD can’t contend 
with those schools this year.

“Pepperdine and USC are 
strong teams and if we play like 
we did against Irvine we can come 
away with a pair of wins,” he said.

Pepperdine suffered two losses 
last week to No. 4 UCLA and No. 
9 UC Irvine. Junior outside hitter 
Paul Carroll leads the Waves with 
6.71 kills per game, with help from 
senior setter Jonathan Winder, the 
2007 AVCA and MPSF Player of 
the Year. Pepperdine is coming 
off a final four appearance at the 
NCAA Division I Finals last year, 
in a season it set the all-time wins 
mark in the MPSF. 

Head coach Kevin Ring said 
that Pepperdine is strong but that 
UCSD will come prepared.

“[Pepperdine] is one of the top 
teams in the country despite two 
losses last weekend,” Ring said. 
“They’ve got some strong hitters 
but they also have tendencies. It’s 
our job to learn and take advan-
tage of what we know.”

USC will roll in one day later 

to try and take advantage of the 
Tritons’ tired legs, but the team is 
doing its best to prepare for the 
challenge.

“Our five-game match against 
Hawaii was tiring and if we go 
to five games against Pepperdine, 
we’ll be tired on Saturday,” 
Spangler said. “We do a lot of con-
ditioning during practice to pre-
pare us for three matches in row 
and we have guys that can come in 
off the bench if we need them.”

Ring echoed Spangler’s com-
ments and mentioned that some 
of the players had been downed by 
injuries or sickness.

“It’s been a tough week return-
ing from Hawaii with the time 
change,” he said. “It’s not a lot of 
recovery time and we have things
