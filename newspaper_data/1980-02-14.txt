"Sum victim. have either died or received

And about that, Artenatein can certainly

"As I grew up, I came to formulate a dream -

says Arten.tein. 

In 1978, Artenstein took the first steps toward 
that goal, in.piring and organizing seven

effort to promote bum safety. 

"At that time: I was working as a volunteer at

The politically conservative

again by the responses to draft

assembly members, many of 
whom were involved in the 
movement to halt the Vietnam 
War. 

Lut week, assemblyman Tom 
Bates, D.Berkeley. drafted a letter 
to President Carter opposing 
resiatralion on the grounds that "it 
will make resumption of a draft 
much more likely, if not 
inevitable. " 

Bates aho contended

who fought in the Korean War. 

Sates, who drafted the 
resolution becauae he did not feel 
enough support could be mustered 
cancelled a pr:.ess conference

saw how few signatures he had.

Letter writer Steve Powell 
states, "we can't have the land

Here's Pie in Your Face, . Guardian 
Editor: 

The machinations and distortions suffered by 
comedic revolutionaries from your paper are 
nothing new. This time, however, you have 
struck a new low. We refer to your article in last 
Friday's issue: "Pie Tosser'Abuses Everybody." 

The inaccuracies in the article were legion. 
The lecture was held in TLH 107, not 104 as 
you r~rt. Perhaps this is the reason the 
remainder of your article is so inaccurate. 

Aron Kay's appearance was sponsored by the 
Groucho Marxist Caucus-you got this wrong 
as well. Aron, during his two-hour lecture, 
addressed a wide variety of topics , including the 
government murder of Kennedy, and rise of the 
right and the potential for human liberation in the 
1980.. 

By no mean. did Aron sho.w contempt for 
everyone, as your headline claimed. Aron, 
admittedly, did refer to Howard Jive-ass, Jerky 
BroWl'!, and other notables in a less·than· 
favorable light- but do these individuals nol 
merit lOme abuse? On the whole, Aron's speech 
was a positive one, referring to the vast potentials 
for organizaing that we face in the eighties. And 
Aron's work with the YIP- not to menlion his 
often dmigrated tactic of pie throwing (which has 

/ 

great potential as a tool for comedic 
revolution)-has been of great help to those 
striving to attain a synthesis between theory and 
practice-politics and culture. His work has been 
an inspiration to G . Marxists throughout the 
world. 

As to your allegation that but twelve people 
attended A ron's. lecture, we have nothing but 
ridicule. Although attendance was admittedly 
less than anticipated (due, in part, no doubt to 
impending mid·terms,) far more than 12 people 
were in attendance. In point of fact, there were 
people sitting in the aisles. The attendance was 
not so high that an accurate count was 
impossible- apparently, however, your reporter 
chose not to present an accurate count. . 

Comedy shall reign triumphant despite the 
base slanders of conformists around the world. 
Neither your paper nor · anti·comedic forces 
gathering in such distant points as San Fransisco 
(where we were recently slandered over cable 
television by one Bonnie St. Eiger, a woman 
sadly lacking in understanding of the basic 
principles of G. Marxism) shall succeed in 
deterring us from the course of comedic 
revolution. Comics to the streets!

Draftees May Give Up 
Chance at Good Career 

By Martin Brown 
The 1980 version of anti·draft demonstrations on college 

campuses may be motivated partially by a much more 
powerful stimulus than the political anti-war sentiments of the 
Vietnam era. For today's college student, a delay of two or 
more years in completing a .college education could appear to 
mean the difference bet~n a satisfylrfg professional career 
and the lack of one. 

The issue is economic self·interest. 
The difference separating the student of today from the 

student of 10 years ago lies in the virtual revolution which has 
taken place in the American labor market. During most of the 
years o( the Vietnam war draft, college students had the 
comfort of knowing that unemployment was at historic lows, 

Marlin Brown, an associate editor 01 Pacilic News 
Service, teaches at San Francisco State. 

and that the market value of their college degree appeared 
secure. But in today's economic environment, good jobs-
those that offer upward mobility, good pay and long-term 
security-are growing fewer and fewer by the year, and the 
economic leverage represented by the college degree is 
growing weaker and weaker. 

In short, the student of the 1980s-uncertain of where he 
fits in an insecure economy- is ruahing toward a door to 
economic opportunity that is dosing. The longer it takes him 
to get there, the leas chance he will have of getting through. 
And a two-year stint in the Army must seem to represent a 
vel}' significant hurdle. . 

The reality of this closing door is highlighted by data from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It reveals that while 
employment of college grciduates grew by 76 percent 
between 1968 and 1978, the quality of employment 
declined. The proportion of college graduates employed in 
desirable professional and technical occupations actually 
dropped during the decade because the number of qualified 
candidates grew faster than the number of jobs in those 
occupations. 

As a result of the declining opportunities for good jobs, a 
quarter to one-third of all employed college graduates today 
hold jobs traditionally filled by someone with less schooling. 
And naturally , as the number of college. educated candidates 
move down the job ladder, a proportion of high-school (or 
less) educated job·seekers are bumped completely off the 
ladder. 

-()bviously, this predicament is of the greatest importance 
to those who aspire to the "elite" bracket of the job market-
the professional and managerial jobs. And just as obviously, 
it is from the elite universities that the loudest outcry against 
the draft is coming. 

These students know the harsh economic dictum of 1980: 
get into the right line as fast as you can and stay there, or else 
you might lose your place for good. An involuntary two-year 
delay in today's environment may mean a lifetime of regret. 

Whether such a perception corresponds to reality is 
another matter; in an anxious world facts are easily 
exaggerated beyond reality and it is commonly 
acknowledged that today's campuses are caught in a 
whirlpool of economic anxiety . 

On the. other hand, there is also evidence that the draft 
historically has been beneficial to the less advantaged sectors 
of the labor market, particularly to minorities who have been 
confined to the lower rungs of the job ladder by various 
factors. A recent study by sociologist Dudley L. Poston, Jr. of 
the University of Texas as Austin reveals that black and 
brown armed forces veterans have fared significantly better in 
the job market than black and brown non·veterans. 

This is presumably because of the training in technical and 
social skills they received in the service, which qualified them 
for skilled jobs in the private or public economy. It is difficult 
to predict, however , that this pattern will hold up in today's 
rapidly changing economy, in which a "de-skilling" of jobs is 
accompanying increased automation and a shrinking 
manufacturing !lector. ' 

The other significant finding in Poston's study is that an 
Army stint does not benefit white veterans in the job market. 
The data , he writes, "suggests that military service is not 
economically beneficial for Anglo men .. .Indeed, our data 
suggest a real cost in being a veteran foY Anglos." Posten said 
in an interview that the same pattern holds for all Anglos, w~th 
or without college education. 

One of the most obvious measures of that cost-one which 
draft·age students are acutely aware of-is the declining 
access to home ownership. The American dream of the 
privately-owned home is becoming more and more remote 
with each passing year of double-digit inDation. A two-year 
delay in getting onto the property rolls may well mean 
permanent renter status for many young people, as housing 
prices continue to rise at a rate of 20 percent a year. Already, 
only about one quarter of all families can afford to own a 
home, compared to some two-thirds in the 1950.. Two years 
from now, that quarter may shrink to a filth . 

In the housing situation, particularly, the measage is dear 
to today's students: Get it-while you can, because tomorrow it 
may be gone. To students who might nQmlaily expect to enter 
the home-owner class of society, the -prospect of the draft 
confronts them with what appears 10 be'an economic roulette 
game that could leave them in the non·ownership class.

Khomeini Backs 
Hostage Plan 

PARIS - President A~lhassan Bani-Sadr o( 'ran 
Said yesterday that revolution. 
ary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini has accepted a 
three. point "action plan" for 
the negotiated release of the 
US hostages in Tehran. 

But in an interview with the 
radio station France.lnter 
recor:ded Tuesday, and 
broadcast yesterday, Bani. 
Sadr would not say whether he 
envisioned the imminent 
release of the hostages. "It ia a 
~ssibility . It depends," he 
scud. 

His remarks appeared to be 
the first indication Khomeini 
h~ agreed to a new three. 
POint plan Bani-Sadr has set 
forth in an effort to break the 
deadlock over the approxi-
mately 50 hostages, who have 
been held by Islamic militants

In an interview published

INFOSWITCH, UCSD's new system for

phone costs by 15 percent, but may also lead to 
a lot of tired fingers. 

The system adopted in December, uses 
leased bulk·rate cables, like W ATS and ATSS 
lines ~nd employs a mini-computer to allocate 
and keep detailed accounting records. UCSD's 
"typical" $4S,OOO/month phone bill will be

system. But a three minute call to Stanfo~d which 
would cost $1.70 in the Bell system, might cost 
as little as $.33 in INFOSWITCH. 

And Shaw says computations s~ow t~at the 
INFOSWITCH system will pay for Itself In three

That Nice Beach House May Fall Into Sea 

By Monica Gieben 
Staff Writer 

A recent study on cliff erosion in San 
Diego County shows that prime spots 
along the coast eagerly being bought 
up by view-loving homeowners are 
more likely to fall into the sea than was 
previously believed. 

Old estimates of erosion rates were 
based on unusually placid years, 
scientists now say. 

Gerald Kuhn and Francis Shepard 
of the Geological Research Divison at 
Scripps I nstitution of Oceanography, 
and Jeff Frautschy, assistant director 
of Scripps, have been carefully 
reviewing the condition of San Diego 
bluffs, digging into past historical 
records and coming up with some very 

important and previously ignored 
information. 

"Careful review of historical records 
gives us the opinion that much of the 
coastal bluff area of San Diego County 
is a hazardous area for building, 
particularly near the bluff edges," says 

. Kuhn. 
The results of the project, funded by 

Sea Grant , indicate that the 
assessments of building sites along the 
shoreline have been inappropriately 
based on the observations of cliff 
conditions during an inactive period of 
30 years. 

Frautschy explains, "Most of the 
shoreline development in San Diego 
County has occurred in the last 30 
years or so, and the most people have 

• 

(bottom), aUowinB 
and condominiuma ue 1M ........ , ..... 
aeuonal erosion from hiP ... ... 

come to the area during that time. 
"Construction has been based on 

what they have observed during this 
period, which turns out to be quite 
atypical. It's been a very benign period 
as far as weather is concerned and in 
terms of storms at sea and rainfall in 
the area," he says . 

"There has been only moderate 
erosion in a few areas," Frautschy 
continues. "The main body of 
information that has resulted in this 
study is that recent years have been 
quite atypical of past periods of the 
county's history.' And those past 
periods have been overlooked by 
housing developers, Frautschy says. 

This information on the past history 
of erosion is based on old maps, 

newspapers, weather bureau reports, 
ships' logs, records of land ownership 
and dicussions with long-time 
residences. 

Kuhn explains that, "During periods 
of the past, sea storms and heavy 
rainfally coincided with a high tide, 
causing large scale property damage. 
Trains were lost, buildings were Io.t." 

"During the 1880's and 1930'.," he 
adds, "there were 40-foot swells and 
30-foot waves recorded. We haven't 
seen any of this for a long time." 

Frautschx, cites a personal 
experience 'back in 1947" when 
measuring breakers of 42 feet, and 
adds that such an occurance was not 
rare during that period.

Since hi. departure from the

Hartman has done little in the 
way of retpeetable w~rk. Th~s 

. album is no exception. HIS 
be.t·known composition, 'free 
Ride' is featured on this disc, a1t~gh it is difficult to 
understand why since except 
for a vocorder/guitar solo and 
a longer interpretation, the 
basic arrangement is identical 
to the '73 version. 'Hands 
Down' is the only selection 
which merill discourse , 
featuring lOme tasty Stevie 
Wonder harmonica and a brief 
flurry of Edgar Winter 
saxophone runs. The album 
has a funky gospel flair, but 
the material, commercial in 
appeal, is unjustifiably long 
and tedious, and hence 
unacceptable for commercial 
AM I1!lease. Hartman is an 
excellent sinMer, a mediocre 

musician, and an insignificant 
composer. C.

I am one of these staunch·

fully, since the improvisation~ 
aspect i. someho~ blurred m 
the isolated confmes of the 
studio, where there is too much 
temptation to floll ove~ 
imperfections. Violinist Venuti 
has been around. His 
performances have varied 
from soulful to embarrassing, 
with ~ttle predictability as to 
when he will have a good 
night. This was not one of 
Joe's better nights , but there 
are facton to consider before 
discountins this record. first , 
these .tudio recordings are 
unedited, and if there were any 
retakes , then these guys were 
fucking up allover the .place. 
The recording and nux are 
abysmally poor, by anyone's 

standards. But the spontaneity 
essential to the music is there, 
and the selection of material , 
including Gershwin tunes and 
Lerner and Lowe numbers , 
enhances the performance. 

By far the best cut is " I've 
Grown Accustomed to Her 
face", which features some 
soulful but sloppy Venuti, and 
a very extemporaneous and 
lovely piano solo, ~ut the 
tightness of ,t~ ban~ IS s~y

deve(opment needs such as lawn 
and .arden watering drainage, have

Even the foot traffic on the cliffl 

has contributed to the prohlem by 
creating traill and new drainage 
patterns. 

Kuhn aIao explains that, "Some 
areas are under stress due to lack of

along the shoreline. 

With Problems 
Bill Kock, the Closs-country skier who 

surprised the ski fraternity by winning a silver 
medal at the Innsbruck Olympics four years 
ago, has a good chance today in the 30-
kilometer cross-country race on Mt. Van 
Hoevenberg. 

The Taiwan delegation asked the US 
Olympic CommittP.e to be excused from the 
Games yesterday after it lost a · court battle 
over its flag, name and anthem. 

Meanwhile, athletes from the People's 
Republic of China marched in the opening 
ceremonies and prepared for their. first 
Olympic competition since the communist 
revolution is 1944. 

In order to convince Mainla.nd 
China to return to the Olympics, the 
International Olym,Pic Committee adopted a 
rule requiring the Taiwan athletes to use an 
Olympic committee flag, call themselves the 
China-Taipei Olympic Committee, and not 
use their traditional national anthem. The 
courts upheld this and the Taiwan team would 
not accept it. 

"The mere suggestion that we have to 
accept any flag but our national flag is a 
downright insult," said Thomas Hsueh, 
spokesman for the 18 athletes from Taiwan as 
the delegation packed to leave just two hours 
before the opening ceremony. 

The Olympic Icene continued to be marred 
by the failure of a bus transportation system 
and many athletes as well as spectators had to 
walk a mile and a half back from the opening 
ceremonies at the Itadiwn on the horse Ihow 
grounds south of the ~Uage. A monumental 
traffic jam deveiopecJ as the ceremony ended 
and thouSandl began the hike.
