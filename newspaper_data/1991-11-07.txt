Campus Sales 
In Recession

St8tr~ 
Businesses on campus are facing lower rev-

enues and a falloff in retail as a result of the 
nation's economic recession. 

While the impact of the downturn varies from 
store to store, most UCSD businesses reported 
sluggish sales as compared to last year. 

"Sales are a little down from last year, nota lot." 
said Jeff Corbett of the GeneraI Store Co-op. The 
General Store and the UCSD Bookstore are two 
businesses facing only limited negative effects of 
the recession. 

"I wouldn't say we've had a downturn," said 
John Hallett, financial manager of the Bookstore, 
"just less of an upturn." 

While Bookstore revenue from the sale of school 
and business supplies has dropped, clothing and 
retail book sales are ahead of last year. Further-
more, computer sales have dramatically risen from 
a year ago, primarily because of the sales of new 
Apple computers. 

''Textbook sales have been relatively flat." 
Hallett said. largely as a result of the effects of the 
recession on the consumer. More students are 
buying books from the Co-ops or sharing texts in 
order to defray costs, he added . 

1be GeneraI Store Iq)OI1S a similar trend in its 
btaincss during the recession. 

Exb'ancous iterils suCh as school supplies have 
dropped off from a year ago, but food sales have 
rwnained normal. 

In this sense, businesses like the bookstore and 
the General Store are somewhat recession-proof. 
While sales of luxury items will undergo some 
dec1lne, the overall economic stability of the store 
will ranain untouched because of the constant 
revenue from the sale of essential items. 

"Being a non-profit store, where we keep our 
prices down. helps us." Corbett said. 

This is not the case with other businesses on 
campus which face more drastic losses because of 
the n:cession.

Immo Scheffler presents Amara Siva with an incentive award for academic excellence. 

• Native American Amara Siva wins $1,<xx> for academic excellence , 
By Suzanne Phan 
Guardian Repolfer 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) 
has awarded Amara Siva, an 18-year-old 
UCSD sophomore, the "Incentive for Excel-
lence Prize," a monetary award given to 
encourage minority undergraduates to pur-
sue advanced studies in the sciences. 

comes in conjunction with the awarding of 
an NSF Graduate Fellowship to Daniel lohn-
son, a graduate student in UCSD's Biology 
Department The undergraduate prize woon 
by Siva is offered as inspimtion to an 
underrepresented sophomore or junior in 
any department which has had an NSFGradu-
ate Fellowship recipient. 

The $1 ,000 award was presented to Siva, 
a Native American biology student, by Pro-
fessorlmmoScheffler, the chair of the Biol-
ogy Department The presentation was made 
last week at a reception at the UCSD interna-
tional Cent,cr. 

The "Incentive for Excellence Prize" 

UCSD's Howard Hughes Science En-
richment Program, which conducts under-
graduate apprenticeships, was given the task 
of choosing a recipienl for the award. 

Undergraduate Science Enrichment C0-
ordinator and representative from the 
Howard Hughes Foundation Bonnie 
Schmiege said the award "encourages 
underrepresented minorities to come into 
the sciences and do graduate work. Since so 
few go on [in school], it is imponantto have 
these incentives." 

"[The selection comminee] could not 
have picked a more outstanding candidate," 
Schmiege said. "[Siva] is very intelligent, 
outgoing and a commined type of person." 

Last summer, Siva was awarded an ap-
prenticeship through the Howard Hughes 
program, working at a neurobiology labora-
tory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
where she studied fish as well as vertebra. 
During this apprenticeship, Siva learned to 
analyze the brains of fish and to use an

HRC Steering 
Committee Sets its

• The coalition hopes to incorporate

Vowing to tackle such issues as hate crimes. discrimi-
nation and infringement of first amendment free-speech 
rights at UCSD, the newly fonned Human Relations 
Coalition (HRC) has begun to determine its goals and 
responsibilities through a steering comminee. 

The steering committee is headed by Lesbian, Gay & 
Bisexual Association (LGBA) Officer of Intemal Af-

At an Oct. 29 meeting, the steering commiHee drew

on San DiegoCounty's(SDC) HRC Duties and Respon-

SOC HRC was created by the San Diego City Coun-

guidelines were modified for use by the UCSD HRC, 
which is not affiliated with the San Diego group. 

The committee decided at the meeting that one of the

But now the "turf" isn't a neighborhood or a street

Some whites are upset over the fact that they are 
losing control of the college campuses tbar they feel 
are rightfully theirs. 

However, where once privileged whites mainly 
called academia home, now Asians, Chicanos and 
bids also lay claim to the benefits that a college can 
provide. 

The colleges thai whites believed belonged to 
them solely, are no longer theirs.

COMMENTARY 

Multicultural Colleges? God Help Us All ••• 
By Zachary Berman 
Senior Staff Writer 

Thumbing through a newsmagazine, I 
came upon a drawing. Two people were 
walking by a university which had before it 
a sign reading, "Racism Awareness 
Center." Below it, the caption read: "1bey 
used to call them schools." Learning has 
become a subversive and poltica\ activity. 

When one wishes to visit the depths of 
our present predicament in higher educa· 
tion, the University of Califomia at 
Berkeley is a good place to stan. Minority 
enrollment is steadily on the rise. Indeed, 
for the first time in UC Berkeley's history, 
whites are no longer the majority. This is 
not a sign of the great strides minorities 
have made. It is the product of years of 
government tinkering. These days, people 
are numbers and our nation musl have its 
daily dose of numerical equality. Therefore, 
Berkeley cooked the books, The Los 
Angeles T~s reported that 50 percent of 
all adminants were based on non .. academic 
criteria 

Now lake this and sprinkle it with tenured 
radicals, politically motivaled bureaucraIs and 

'~mreads. and "poof!" - you get 
multiculturalism. Unfortunately, if not handled 
properly, this oombinarioo also tends to 
produce segregation. 

Universities are dealing with diversity 
all wrong, Confronted with this newfound 
minority presence, they are sowing the 
seeds of "us against them" in the heart of 
every starernent. 

For instance, many campuses -
including UCSD - have special minority-
only graduation ceremonies. A good 
eumple is Vasur College. As a result of 
complaints that its comment'cmalt cormnit-

tee has events in "bars that cater to 
rednecks" wxi'rejects "black things," 
including "refusing to serve real food at 
events"(whatever that means), the univer-
sity created a black commencement 
comminee. 

With this comes the cries of "Hey, ho, 
Westem Civ's got to go." Univel1>ity 
administrators are more than happy to 
comply. Many, if not mosl, colleges have 
scrapped their Westem civilization require-
ments and replaced them wilh PC 101. 
Western civilization, known to many close-
minded individuals on the modem campus 
solely as the work of "dead white males," is 
aggressively bashed in these minority 
morale boosting courses. Any objections 
can usually be quelled with the simple 
epithet "racist." 

Moreover, the faults of the non-
European cultures are conveniently swept 
under the chalkboard. Ironically, this kind 
of myopia is one of the standard criticisms 
of the current study of Western history. 

These mandated sensitivity courses are 
designed around the "feel good" curricu-
lum. TIley often distort the lruth or rush to 
embrace unproven theories. In an anempt to 
have the most "firsts," one mYlh is being 
blindly swapped for another. A good 
example of this is the current 
Egyptianization of black histol)'. The search 
for cultural worth Iw led many to decree that 
the ancient Egyptians were actually black. 

This is suspect to say the least Indeed, 
Dr. Jackson, professor of history at 
Columbia notes that "this interpretation 
remains very much in dispute." Ancient 
Egypt has become another historical 
casualty in the war of multiculturalism. 

Minority-only events, student clubs, 

anti·white courses and special admiltance 
programs, have all produced two things -
balkanization and racial unrest. Notice what 
one Mexican-American student at Berkeley 
has learned in the college ohhe future: 
"Now I won't date anyone else but my 
own, for political and personal reasons." 
Bener yet, the nexI time you are on the 
Berkeley campus, go to Sproul Plaza. 
According to the Times, you will see that 
"this separation is visible ... students often 
cluster by race." It all makes sense consid· 
ering the current academic "divide'em and 
indoctrinate'em" method. 

There is hope. We can take the other 
path and stress our commonality. Indeed, 
because we are so diverse we need a 
common denominalor. This is essential if 
this country is to survive. Look at Eastern 
Europe where cultural unrest runs amuck. If 
people continue 10 insist on forcing their 
individual culture down everyone's throat, 
the gap will widen. 

We have a rich and complex heritage 
which we can all share. American legal 
history, literature, philosophy and art, just 
10 name a few, claim authol1>hip by many 
kinds of people. 

Our common cullure is the prodUCI of a 
melting pot. Unfortunately, loyalty to a 
group has become more important Ihan 
loyalty toward a n~ion. 

We all have long and complex cultural 
heritages; they should never be forgotten. But 
nourishing and maintaining them should not 
be the mandated goal of our campuses. 
Culture is personal and unique. The place for 
its growth is in churches, synagogues, 
festivals, dhnic celebralions, magazines, and 
most importantly, the family - not on the 
requiRd reading list of PC 101.

N.nonwide, die U.S. Census pre-
dicts that blacks, Asians, and 
0Ucan0s will eventually outnum-
ber whites duril1l the next oentw')', 
So, the m!dticultural "problem" 
won'tjUSl go away, 

Martha Famswonh Riebe, di-
rector of policy studies 81 the Popu-
lation Reference Bureau (PRB) in 
Washington O,C. wrote: "Without 
fully realizing it, we have left the 
time when the non-white, non-WesI-
em pan of our population could be 
expected to assimil81e to the domi-
nant majority. In the future, the white 
Western majority will have to do 
some assimilation of its own," 

And for many Californians, this 
assimilation is coming a lot sooner 
than they think, 

Alex Desherbinin, a PRB repre-
sentative said. "I think there is no 
doubt thai their influence will be felt 
in the social reabn, the political realm 
and customs," 

"There will be increased 
'multiculturalism,' there's no doubt 
about it. I think mulliculturalism in 
education will bean increasing trend. 

It's all I*' of die inaasing plural-
ity, In my opinion. it's all for the 
better," 

And all in die IIO(-so-distant fu-
ture. 

=====::-Universities like UC Berkeley 
and Ua.A will serve to guideolher 
colleges through die difficulties in 
adapcing to this newfound diversity, 

Berkeley Professor'Troy Duster 
wrote thai Berkeley is "the future of 
American education,.. what hap-
pens at Bedeley ,one of the nation's 
largest public universities and the 
bellwether of social change and in-
novation in academia, will affect all 
of us," 

And it is time for the reS( of the 
UCS to start paying attention, 

California's population is beoom-
ing more "global" and Berkeley's 
diversity is creating an atmosphere 
where students will be able to cope 
with the changes, 

"We are now in a world that is 
truIy global," said Larry Trujillo, a 
memberofBerkeley's ActionTeam. 
"We can touch bases with anyone in 
the world. The work! is multicultural.

The old son of Eurocenttic view of 
thinp is lIO(as important - it needs 
to be expanded." 

Trujillo feels it is important for 
students of differenl backgrounds 
to find a "universal language to be 
able to communicate on a convnon 
ground. " 

Trujillo feels that disagreements 
between diffi:lalt cultural groups 
should be expected. and could even 
be called a healthy pan of the learn-
ing process, 

"We're not problem free. " but I 
think there's a more integrated at-
mosphere here." 

In fact, thequestions thai we face 
wiD require groups to give and take, 
to fight, to scream and to yell. 

The most important lesson that 
we can learn by looking into the 
future is how to deal with the prob-
lem of cultural and ethnic differ-
ences, 

The successful and understand-
ing leaders of tomorrow will learn 
their most irnponant lessons, not in 
the classroom or sensitivity semi-
nars, but in real life, 

The dorm room,the showers, the 
playing field and ,the cafeteria will 
be the true classrooms of 
multiculturalism. Interacting wilh 
each and every unique person, learn-
ing what others love and find inter-
esting, what each person values from 
his history and what he wishes to 
contribute to the future is what the 
college of the fulure should offer.

The question of whether or not 
the rest of the UC campuses will 
catch up to Berkeley'S vision re-
mains to be seen, 

"I think they probably will, but 
that 's a hard question to answer," 
said Bob Laird, a Berkeley admis-
sions officer. "So much depends 
on the state economy and the' 
university's ability to handle the 
increased demand projected by 
most of the demographers who 
have looked at higher education

"The goal, clearly, of the UC 
campuses is 10 reflect the richness 
of the demographic make-up of 
the state. But making that happen, 
otherthan [at] Berkeley and UCLA, 
has proven difficult," Laird said, 

The danger, if the UCs don't 
respond to the multicultural chal-
lenge is a future that some experts 
say would have educated whites 
and Asians in the middle and upper 

,class wiih Chicanos and blacks 
toiling as an underclass. 

In addition, without a multi-
cultural university, there is a dan-
ger that students will live in an 
anachronistic community that 
doesn 't represent the real world, 
Other countries have learned lhe 
lessons about interacling with other 
cultures, 

European andJapanese sludents 
are well versed in multicultural 
politics, Multiculturalism is the 
wave of the future and open-
minded Americans should be on 
its crest. The multicultural uni ver-
sity is no! a lUXUry but a necessity 
to interact and compele in an in-
creasingly global community,

conjunction with the recession, have 
led to this slump in business. 

low computer prices at the Book-
storeand the presence of more com-
pUler labs on campus are pan of a 
chain of events that have created a 
decline in revenue, 

"1be Bookstore lowering its 
[computer] price put us OUI of our 
little niche," Pederson noted, 

"Our only defense is to offer 
more classes in word processing, 
page layout, and spreadsheet," he 
added. 

Business at the Sunshine Store 
has increased since the beginning of 
the fall quarter, but an especially 
slow summer has crealed a drop off 

NSF 
ContIIiI* from PICe 1 
electron microscope, 

Ultimately, Siva said she hopes 
that her laboratory experience this 
summer will prepare her for upper-
division biology courses at UCSD, 

"This knowledge gives me an 
edge in biology labs now. Hope-
fully this experience and this biol-
ogylabwork willgivemetheknowl-
edge of how to use the equipmenl 
and understandmore about the SIruC-

from last year's tOlal retail. 
"People do not have discretion-

ary dollars lhalthey can throwaway 
on frivolous things," observed Sun-
shine Store manager Bonnie 
Hannon. 

"When they come in to buy food 
items, lhey look only for what's 
essential," she said. 

The slumping economy forces 
businesses like Mac's Place and the 
Sunshine Store to alter lheir goals 
for the future, 

Mac's Place depends upon its 
revenue to finance lhe purchase of 
better equipment, such as a color 
scanner. 

With limited resources and a tight 
bud~et, Mac's Place now cannot 
afford such capital expenditures, 

The recession has also played a 

ture of the cell ," Siva said. 
"The doctors and theundergradu-

ate students I worked with were 
really helpful. • was really aslounded 
with all the knowledge the doctors 
at Scripps had," she continued, 

Dr. Walter Heiligenberg, Siva's 
faculty mentor in the apprentice-
ship program, first nominated Siva 
for the NSF award, 

Although Siva says she was sur-
prised to receive the award, she said 
she is pleased 10 receive the finan-
cial assistance,

products are offered at the Sunshine 
Slore, 

". do nolice different trends in 
how I buy," Hannon said. "For sea-
sonal events like Halloween and 
Christmas, I'm buying less because 
people aren't going to have that 
eXIra money to spend. I'm buying 
wilh the reces ion in mind." 

Shoplifting has also become a 
concern at the Sunshine Store, ac-
cording to Hannon, who believe 
that the higher incidenceofshoplifl-
ing is connected to the downswing 
in the economy, 

"If the rece sion continues," 
Corbett remarked, "[or] if it wors-
ens we could be facing some prob-
lems, But forrighlnow, we'redoing 
okay." 

Siva said she plans to major in 
biochemislry or cell biology. Her 
tentative goal is 10 become a mari ne 
biologist. 

Whatever path she chooses to 
take, Siva said she would like to do 
more research work, either at a ma-
rine or medical biology laboratory, 
and that she plans to attend grJduate 
school at Scripps Inslitution of 
Oceanography, 

"There is somuch oUlthere to be 
discovered in the biology and chem-
istry fields," Siva said.

J UST A PEW NOTES: • tn's carry this one step further. Boxing is a farce 
with less legitimacy than the 
World Wrestling Federation, run 
by crooked old men who call each 
other "Don." Boxing is a scam 
thai has suckered everyone but 
Mother Theresa inlo thinking 
pugilism i a sport. And boxing 
should be outlawed so that thieves 
like Don King and Bob Arum will 
be put in jail where large men 
named Brutus can show them that 
not all fights are fixed. 

Take King. According to a 
report by a former FBI agent in 
Spo,.ts lIIuslral~d, he was heavily 
connected with the mob. An 
undercover agent had 10 go 
through a vinualline-up of dons 
and capos just to get a meeting 
'with King. The man was envel-
oped by talk oflaunde~ money, 
fixed fights and bribed officials -
and he managed to escape the 
invesrigarion with nary a hair in 
place. 

Good grief, he kicked a man to 
de8Ih and gar off with just 
manslaughter. 

And for all of this, boxing fans, 
sportscasters and talk show hosts 
(read: Arsenio Hall) still gush 
over him like he's the second 
coming of Moses. Someone's 
stupid, and King's the one who 
hasn't been caught.

They don 't have a gimmick

Instead, they play solid, standard, 
tackle-the-ballcarrier defense. 

And they don't have a gim-

on either the pass (ref. Buffalo 
Bills no-huddle, circa 1990-91) or 
the run (ref. New YOlk Giants,

The Redskins have a balanced

Digging 
. for Gold 

The 1992 men's U.S. Olympic volleyball 
team is facing an uncertain future after 

coming up golden in '84 and '88 
By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

A II in three seconds. The ball rises quickly into theair,climb-ing higher and higher before pausing for 
a split second at the top of its arc. A hand comes 
out of nowhere and slams it at over 70 miles per 
hour toward the hardwood floor. Another set of 
hands swings with controlled wildness into the 
ball's path, punching it high into the air once 
again. 

Brent Hilliard, two years into college and the 
"baby" of the 1992 U.S. Olympic men's volley-
ball team, takes three huge steps and then flings 
himself headlong toward the stands, his eyes

never leaving the ball's flight. His 
ann is extended, reaching desper-
ately in a race for the landing spol. 
His 6-5 frame winds into the famil-
iar dolphin dive. With a soft thump, 
Hilliard and the ball hit the wood 
floor together, his hand losing the 
race by centimeters. 

As the ball bounces wildly off 
the wall and back toward the court, 
he slides uncontrollably across the 
floor. Finally, after careening across 
seven feet of the gym, Hilliard comes 
to a halt, his nose less than two 
inches from the spokes on a bicycle 
tire someone has carelessly placed 
next 10 the court. For a second. he 
drops his head in exhauslion and 
disappointment, muttering anexple-
live. TIlen in one graceful motion, 
he springs 10 his feet and heads back 
10 lhe court, ready 10 take the next 
spike. 

It's back to work for Ihe USA. 

THESE ARE uncertain times forthe 
U.S. Olympic volleyball learn. Af-
lereighl years at the pinnacle of the 
sport, the U.S. finds itself rared no 
better than seventh or eighth in the 
world, according to most observers' 
scorecards. Italy, Cuba, the Soviet 
Union-or what's left of it-and 
Holland now dominate the hard-
wood floors. 

Gone is the piercing intensity of 
Karch Kiraly and the flaming red 
flat-top of Steve Timmons, house-
hold names after leading the U.S. to 
gold medals at the Summer Olym-
pics in 1984and 1988. In thei r places 
are the feigned indifference of Allen 
Allen ar)dtheshiny chromedorneof 
Bob Samuelson. 

Only three members from those 
combined 1984-88 teams remain: 
Doug Panie, Scott Fortune and Eric 
Sato. While the others are off play-
ing professionally in Italy or on the 
Pro aeach circuit, their places have 
been taken by the likes of Hilliard, 
Bryan I vie, Dan Greenbaum and 
Nick Becker - young kids, fresh 
out of college - or in Hilliard's 
case, stilI in college - being asked 
to maintain the torch that their pre-
decessors have spent the past eight 
years lighting. Because, as Assis-
tant Coach John Coole noted last 
wee\c while the U.S. practiced at the 
Main Gym, "All that matters at this 
level is wiMing." 

Yet, as the tearn currently lours 
the Northwest with Holland inprepa-
ration for the World Cup in Tokyo, 
there is an air of uncertainty hang-
ing over the U.S. like a New En-
gland fog. The questions center 

Rising star Bryan \vie (far right) . 
around the recent relaxation of the 
rules which allows professional to 
play in the Olympic games. 

If you thought the basketbalileam 
was the only group that could go to 
Barcelona loaded for bear, think 
again. 

In addition to Panie. gold-medal 
winners Jeff Stork and Craig Buck 
have notified the U.S. that they 
would like to play again in '92. 
Furthermore, players like Kiraly and 
Timmons have yet to officially say 
yea or nay to the idea. It's conceiv-
able that the U.S. could go to Spain 
with essentially the same core group 
that brought horne gold from the 
past two Olympics. 

But, as one observer noted, "Vol-
leyb~1 is a t~ &.~. If one guy 

The UCSD Guardian 

doesn'l make the set, the other guy 
doesn't make the spike. The ques-
tion is will they be able to play 
together." 

Even without the professionals 
factored in, the U.S. still faces a lot 
of questions. For one, Head Coach 
Fred Slurm is bringing a very young 
and inexperienced leam 10 Tokyo, 
one that has nOI spent a lot of time 
playing together. No one is really 
sure what 10 expect. 

"It's hard 10 tell, because we 
have four new guys [on the first-
string)," Cook said. "We won 't know 
until we get into competition." 

1ben there is the question of 
whether or not the U.S. i rebuild-
ing, slowly phasing out the players 
who put American VOlleyball on top 
of the world and replacing them 
with others who can keep it there for 
the next six to eight years. 

Cook prefers not to think of it as 
rebui lding, but as reloading: " I think 
wejust had a rea\ly promising young 
group of guys make Ihe tearn Ihis 
year," he said. 

The most promising is Ivie. who 
has already been designated by some 
as the future star of U.S. volleyball. 
Fresh out of USC, he's a 6-7 middle 
blocker who dominates the net. 

1be other rising star is Hilliard, 
who has put his college career at 
Long Beach State on hold to play 
with the Olympic team. "Ivie has 
shown that he can be real good." 
Cook said, "and Hilliard has shown

All thai matters is that the Tri-
tons will face Cal Lutheran in the 
first round of the NCAA Division 
m tounwnent. 

". always say it's the stan of the 
season." said Head Coach DerU 
Annstrong_ "We 've got enough tal-
ent. II's a matter of putting it to-
gether on the field as a team, flO( as 
a bunch of individuals." 

The Tritons will havc to succeed 
- or go down- as a team. because 
this year's squad lacksadominating 
player who can take over a game. 

Instead, on offense UCSD 
sprcads the wcalth among 
mi<!fielders Chris Romey. Lodoen, 
forwards Mike Albens and Chris 
Han sen and fullback Mike Ger-
hardt, who had four goals to go 
along with his team-leading five 
assists (tied with Hanssen). 

Gerhardt's goal output is down 
from last year when he tied for the 
team lead with nine_ Last year and in 
the early part of this season, he was

TIle match was very similar. 
though, to the Tritons' contest at 
home last Saturday against 
Westmont. 

In fact. UCSD won in vinually 
the same way- dominating early 
and then coming back in the later 
games. 

After controlling the first game 
and winning 15-3.lhe Tritons found 
themselves in a hole, down 5-1 in 
the second. But, as . in Saturday' 
game. the Tritons were able to pull 
themselves together and teal the 
game 15-13. 

The third game was the same 
tory. After falling behind 6-0, the 

Tritons tonned back to win 15-10 
and take the match. 

Dannevik was impressed with 
the play of Liz Vesanovic, "Liz 
played a great game:: he said . 

Vcsanovic led UCSD with 16 digs 
and nine kills, Vikki VanDuyne 
added II kills, and Julie Fabian had 
another outstanding game with 45 
assists, "Julie is the key to our suc-
cess. TIle setter is like the quruter-
back of a footballteaffi." Dannevik 
said. 

Even with the relatively easy vic-
tory. Dannevik still considcrs the 
Leopards a very tough team to beat. 
"They have the ability to play us a 
pre"y tough match," he said. 

According to Dannevik. the Tri-
[on should meet Ihe Leopards once 
again in the postseason: "This time 
for all the marbles." he said. "The 
road to the final four leads through 
La Verne." 

With the tOUlTmment right around 
the comer. Dannevik has bumped 
his e)(pectations up a notch. 

"We played almo t perfect, but 
not quite ... I won't besalisfied until 
we play the peifect game - no 
mistakes." he said. ;'We'restill striv-
ing to play beller ... We' re refining

ContInued tram paCe 12 
reet balls in theairaround the mouth 
of the goal. 

UCSD's most valuable player 
might be Lodoen. 1be Triton ' re-
vival from the dead althe beginning 
of the season coincided with his 
retum from n nagging heel injury. 
His retum allowed several players 
to retum to their normal positions 
and brought stability to the midfield. 
Lodoen tied for third on the team in 
goals with Hanssen -each had six. 

Defensively, UCSD will be led 
by Gerhardt, Alex Savala. Alex 
Spain and Jeff Gagnon. Savala. the 
tearn captain, is the anchor of the 
defense and the squad's best man-
t<rmandefender. SpainandGagnon, 
the two outside fullbacks, are both 
solid defenders who will make oc-
casional rushes up the idelines 'to 

add an extra dimension offensively. 
In fact , a major part of the Tri-

tons' attack is bringing the fullbacks 
up on offense. While it makes for a 
more potent attack, it can also leave 
UCSD wide open for a counterat-
tack. 

"We have a little lack of concen-
lration at times," Armstrong said. 
"We tend to attack a 101 and that 
tends to leave us open (0 trouble." 

Armstrong said that he expects 
Cal Lutheran to employ a game plan 
much li,ke that of CSU San Bernar-
dino earlier this year when the Coy-
otes bent UCSD 1-0. 

"I expect them to sit and wait for 
us to make a mistake," he said. . 

Packing the defense on it own 
side of the field and counterattack-
ing when the opportunity presents 
itself might be the best possible 
strategy for Cal Lutheran. Defense 
has been an Achilles' heel this year

for the iGngsmen - they've sur-
rendered 19 goals-and if they try 
to get in a shooting contest with 
UCSD, the Tritons could run wild. 
. On the other hand, UCSD has to 
be careful not to get too aggressive. 
Willie Ruiz, a 5-7 sophomore for-
ward, led the Kingsmen with 19 
goals. Jeff Popour added 12 and 
Dave Rinehart lallied II . 

"I have a healthy respect fort hem 
and their cpach, George Kuntz," 
said Armstrong. 

Still, the Tritons will not try to 
adjust to the Kingsmen. "We'll do 
what we normally do," Armstrong 
said. "The key is to prepare so that 
we're ready. If they're better than 
us, fine.

Defense. How Cal Lutheran shuts down the Tritons' offense 
could be the key to Sunday's game. Goalie Eddie Guerricabetia and 
company have surrendered 19 goals this year - far more than lhe ' 
average tournament team. Nineteen is the magic number - Willie 
Ruiz led Cal Lutheran with 19 goals. Others (0 watch are Jeff Popour 
(12goa1s, three assists) and Dave Rinehart (I I goals, fourassists).lf 
momentum means anything, the iGngsmen come into the tourna-
ment fresh off a 13-0 pasting of Cal Tech. -
UC SAN DIEGO 

TIle Tritons won without distinction this year. That is, neither the 
offense nor the defense dominated the news. UCSD just went out and 
did enough to rack up another win. 1be team slats are ra~r modest. 

. Ouis Romey led the Tritons with 10 goals. He was followed by Mike 
Albc:ns (seven goals), Chris Hanssen and Mike Lodoen (six goals) 
and Mike Gerhardt (four goals, team-leading five assists). Goalie 
Mike Madden posted 10 shutouts !KId allowed just seven goals all

The Cardinals are led by the three 'Ks' - Katie Kortsch. Kristen 
Kluae and Katie Meissner. TOJether, they tallied 38 goals and 15 
assists. KJuae, a fullback, pairs with her sister Kelly Kluae to anchor 
the Cardinals' defense. Another player to watch is sophomore 
forward Sarah Cave. At one poilll this year, St. Mary's had a seven-
game shutout streak and was outscoring opponents 24-0. Goalies 
Steph Voss and Lynn Sherdc have allowed nine goals this year. 
UC SAN DIEGO 

1be Tritons feature a balanced attack led by forwards Cheryl 
Pmer, Katy Dulock and Karin Lindsay, and midfielder Kalyn Shea. 
The four combined for 38 goals and 29 assists. Fullback Sally 
Weigand, a transfer from USIU, adds an extra dimension. The 
defense could be hurt by the loss of sophomore defender Jaymie 
Bradford, who is out for the season with tom knee ligaments. Goalie 
Jenelle Welling posted II shutouts this year. 1be Tritons have 
outscored their opponents S8'().

'Black Robe' Revea's Truth 
By Art KnIwItI 
Guardian Repotter 

With a tide like "Black Robe," 
one might expect the newest horror 
flick to be filled with unending gobs 
of disgusting honor effects, chilling 
scenes of people being mutilated 
and little children being callously 
murdered. "Black Robe" is, how-
ever, not a honor film, nor is it 
intended to be of the honor movie 
genre yet the director deals with the 
historical subject mailer of this film 
in such a vivid yet reali tic way that 
it leaves the viewer with a sense of 
horror. 

The year is 1634 and the French 
miss ionary Father Laforgue 
(Lothaire Bluteau) has realized that 
his life's destiny is to convert the 
"savages" to Christianity. He ar-
rives in America and is anxious to 
begin his adventures with his com-
panion Daniel (Aden Young), a 
French peasant who is fluent in the 
native Algonquin tongue. 

11le [wo set off for a faraway 

missionary outpoSt under the care 
of a large group of Algonquin Indi-
ans, but the Algonquins soon grow 
distrustful of Laforgue. They call 
him Blacle Robe because of his 
suange, celibate, missionary ways. 
The Indians become convinced that 
Blacle Robe is a demon, and they 
leave him behind, stranded. Daniel 
follows the group and his new love.

daughter Annuka (Sandrine Holt). 
leaving Black Robe to fend for him-
self. 

Chief Chornina' s (August 
Schellenberg) conscience compels 
him' to tum around and rejoin 
Laforgue, leaving behind the 
Algonquin band. He, his family, 
and Daniel head into an enemy 
Iroquois ambush where they and 
Laforgue are all captured. 

From here to the end, the film 
becomes increasingly grizzly, vivid 
and bloody. After escaping their 
captors, Laforgue, Daniel, Annuka,

infonnat~ on the history of the art 
works and their crealOf'L 

On the day we visited, the per-
sonnel manager, Marsha Kancor, 
presented herself more .. • tour 
guide than a saIe5 representalive 
eager to sell (maybe .'s because 
she knew we weren't suilll to buy 
anything). Understanding we were 
students, she helped us to Ieam more 
about the WOIts on display and did 
not ignore us like some (ncedless.to 
name) pretentious an galleries who 
only care about ·clients. ' 

• •• C ..... UNCI 
"',ay 

While browsing through the 
Simic-New Renaissance Gallery on 
Prospect, there is a feeling like that 
of intruding on salespeople who are 
working only on high commission. 
Upon identifying ourselves as 
UCSD reporters, we were greeted 
with a .cun, "We're with clients 
right now ..... from a lady with a 
fake, plastered-on smile and a de-
meaning attitude. She didn't look 
like she was "with a client," though 
she did look ready to pounce on 
anyone who smelled like money. 

Of all the galleries we visited, 
this one, without a doubt, cateres 10 
the highesl echelon of wealth. II has 
an immaculaae, museum-like feel 10 
it, and the paintings, most of which 
were done by French impression-
ists, hang regally on the walls in 
formal display. High class or not, 
however, we wereabit disillusioned 
by the service. 

11le salespeople loomed over 
prospective customers like flies, 

while treating anyone uninterested 
in buying theirpaimings as not wor-
tby of their time. 

M'IIIMIOUS 
LocaIed in Del Mar, Artragcous 

has a unique link to UCSD - it is 
owned and operated by a fonner 
UCSDCommWlication major, Rob 
Markoff. Unlike the majority of 
galleries we visited, this gallery re-
semblesan upscale posterand fram-
ingshop. 

Wallcing into it, one is struck by 
the brilliantly colored posters and 
array of frames that hang on the 
walls. II has the makings of a con-
ventional poster shop, and yet the 
selection is unusual enough to dis-
tinguish it from other stores. 

Scenes of nature, cartoon post-
ers, mini-posters, as well as a vari-
ety of colorful, offbeat looking prints 
(that, by the way, displayed a rea-
sonable price range) hang casually 
on the walls of this store that is 
known for its custom framing and 
regu1arcustomers. Markoff was very 
helpful and even shared some of his 
UCSD/CommWlication major an-
ecdotes (we could sympathize, we 
are both Communication majors). 

Markoff shared very real experi-
ences about his fonner major and 
we seemed to feel a bond with this 
ex-UCSD student. Markoff is able 
10 make anyone walking in from the 
streets feel at ease enough to ask for 
help and maybe even purchase an 
item or two. 

This store is worth the visit if 
you're thinking of doing some seri-
ous purchasing to make your apart-
menl or donn room more colorful, 
or even for those who want to make 
their own art look nicer. 

The UCSD Guardian 

""U""IY 
Speaking of school, UCSD has a 

very nice gallery ofitsown. Located 
next to the Grove Caffl! is the Grove 
Gallery. 'The Gallery 's newestex.hi-
bition is entitled "Neon D." At the 
opening reception on Nov. 15 at 
6:30 p.m., the exhibition will be 
presented along with a piece of per-
fonnance an. "Neon U" is a show 
with an ecological story line. 

'The artists participating in the 
showcase are Ron Carlson, Peter 
David, Tessie Dong, Freddy Elliot, 
Michael Aechtner, Maurice Gray, 
Karl Hauser, Kim Koga, Ben 
Livingston, Reiko Motogami, 
Sheny Nickell, Kunio Ohashi. and 
David Svenson. TIle exhibirion of 
"Neon 0" will continue through Dec. 
20. 

TIle performance piece to be pre-
sented on opening night is entitled, 
"Fish Story - A Shon Neon Per-
fonnance Parable." The show will 
be presented on risers in the Gallery. 
TIle cast members will be wearing 
hard hats, each with a neon fish on 
top. 11ley will also be holding a 
turquoise-colored, neon "wave," 
powered by battery packs. 

According to neon artist Karl 
Hauser, "'There is a good guy and a 
bad guy, but the audience must draw 
its own conclusions about the par-
able." 11le Grove Gallery is open 
from lOam. to 5 p.m. every Tues-
day through Friday, and from ' 10 
a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays. 

These are just a few of the many 
galleries one can visitandexplorein 
the UCSD area. For those of you 
who may want to enjoy an afternoon 
filled with color and culture, this is 
just a sample.

'The characters in this movie 
are panicularly interesting. 1l1e 
three-dimensional Indian char-
acters, unlike the "Dances with 
Wolves"canoon-Indians, are the 
apparent heroes of the movie -
because Laforgue proves again 
and again that he can 't deal with 
the harsh realitiesoflife. Annuka 
is intriguing in her affection to-
ward Daniel, which is tempered 
with her rugged discipline from 
living in the wild. Daniel is a 
fully developecicharacter as well. 
'The writers show his depth when 
he challenges Black Robe's 
Anglo-Saxon religious views, but 
later rescinds at the moment of 
truth because he fears missing 
out on Heaven. 

Father Laforgue carries the 
film most strongly on his admit-
tedly small and fearful shoul-
ders, constantly fighring the in-
ternal tensions of his character.

1ne directing of this movie 
was its worst feature. Bruce 
Bersford jumped from angle to 
angle so often that it was dis-
rracting. Forexarnple. in a con-
versalion between Father 
Laforgueand the colonial bishop

camera stans out in one comer 
of the room far from the actors, 
and then cuts to a 'Spy-like loca-

in through aclosed window (with 
dialogue unimpaired intheleast). 

"Black Robe," overall, pro-
vides a much more realistic feel-
ing of the history it is trying [0 
convey than many ofitscontem-
porary revisionisr counterparts. 

It is a movie that is notapolo-. 
getic for the lack of undersrand-
ing and the cruel extelmination 
that thelndianssuffered because 
it portrays a reality, which seems 
more important for this movie 
and its director. 

"Black Robe" more than 
makes up for the occasional an-
noying flaws in camerawork 
with its noble purpose and pow-
erful achievement.

the Halloween Pere Ubu/Pixies concert

Few bMds have the 8bility 10 explode on s. with mISSive eneray. 
'nit Pixies blew everyone away on Halloween with a brutal attack ofhard 
sW" and sonp about space and movies. 

ThePixies~currently on tour fortheir fifth album. Trompe Le Monde, 
a collection of sonp thai rocks fast and hard. Their last album, Bossanova, 
was more subdued and concemed with outerspace. Tr~ picks up from 
their other works and moves with speed and general weirdness. 

The opening act, the underrared Pere Ubu, was supposed to supply us 
with two tickets. When my friend and I arrived at will call, t~ was only 
one. So we spent most of Pere Ubu' s set outside looking 10 buy a ticket. 
Luckily, a guy hid an extra 
ticket and gave it to us - for 
free I We went in to see a 
costume-clad crowd sleep-
ing through Perc Ubu's set 

For what seemed like an 
eternity, cheezy country-
rock blared over the P.A. 
system between bends, until 
clouds of smoke emanated 
from the tiny stage at 
Montezuma Hall. Singer/ 
guitarist Francis Deal, gui-
tarists Joey Santiago and 
Kim Deal, and drummer 
David Lovering took the 
staae and ripped into a col-
lection of songs that pro-
ducedan out-of-control slam 
pit Instead of focusing on 
their slower tunes such as 
"Here Comes Your Man." 
they played with a chip on 
their shoulder.

Withoutsayina many worda 10 thecollegiale crowd, the quartet gave the

The most nocable songs were harsh versionsof'1'ame, .... Debaser," and 
"Subblcultcha. " The crowd whipped into a big pit for the Jesus and Mary 
awn cover of "Head On." The Pixies seemed to be pissed. They played 
like angry musicians and rarely cracked a smile. But then again, theirmusic 
isn't wanD or loving. The Pixies play psychotic punk and rock from 
another planet Ind their fans have no choice but to catch the attitude.

more. Still,lDOIt people seemed very content with the intensity and sweat
