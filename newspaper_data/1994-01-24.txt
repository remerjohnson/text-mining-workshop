. A.Nl\.LYSI.S Peltason and other

with the UC's lingering economic woes. 

Nowhere was this more apparent than at last 
week's Board of Regents meeting in San Fran-
cisco, where the buzzwords among university 
officials throughout the two-day summit were 
"maintaining quality." 

"The new climate of fiscal constraints means 
that the university must plan strategically if it is to 
maintain the excellence for which it is justly 
renowned," said UC Provost Walter E. Massey.

Regents 
Approve 
Fee Hikes 
PLAN: Undergraduates and 
graduates will pay more in 1994-
95; 'share-the-pain' budget 
projections could worsen in May 
By PhlJlp Mlc"aels 
News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO - Endorsing what 
University of California President Jack 
Peltason described as a "share-the-pain" bud-
get plan, the UC Board of Regents approved 
a proposal calling for across-the-board under-
graduate fee hikes in 1994-95 . 

REGEnTS I 
MEETING 

The bud-
get, which 
was approved 
by the full 
board during 
last Friday's 
meeting at 

UC San Francisco, mirrors the proposal put 
forth by Gov. Pete Wilson earlier this month. 
In that budget, Wilson called for a 3.2 percent 
increase in state fultdinS (or the University o( 
California. 

Despite the increase, which was the first 
for the UC system in four years, the university 
still needed an 8.8 percent boost in funding to 
balance its budget. 

To meet the shortfall, the regents approved 
a $620 hike of undergraduate for next year. In 
addition, the regents adopted a $2,000 fee for 
students entering the university'S professional 
schools of law, medicine, business, dentistry 
and veterinary medicine. 

University officials said that one-third of 
the revenue generated from each of the fee 
increases would be set aside for financial aid . 

According to figures from the UC Office 
of the President, fees have risen by 125 per-
cent over the last four years. 

"We said in the regents' budget that we 
anticipated that we might get about 3-3.5 
percent from the state, and if so, that we would 
need to increase general student fees by about 
$600 to $650 and, additionally, establish a 
special fee for students in selected profes-
sional schools," said UC Provost Walter E. 
Massey. 

"We ourselves are acting in good faith con-
sistent with all of out own statements. In short, 
there are no surprises here," Massey added.

UC Regent Unveils

SAN FRANCISCO - In an

hopeful that the remainder of the 
board will take an active role in 
this initiative," she added. 

According to Connerly, by Fri-
day most of the regents had al-
ready expressed their interest in 
and support for the proposal.

On Thursday, 

Regent Ward 
Connerly de-
scribed his Student

plan, members of 
the Board of Re-
gents would use 
their ties to the 
California business 
community to per-
suade companies to 
provide UC stu-
dents with employ-
ment opportuni-

Ideally, the jobs 
would pay high 
wages, offer flex·

available within the 
student's areas of 
study.

told his fellow re-
gents as he un· 
veiled his pro-
posal. 

"The Office of 
the President and 
chancellors will 
give their full sup-
port to this initia-
ti ve," Peltason 
said. 

"We are trying 
to provide with re-
gent leadership a 
cadre of regents to 
fan out throughout 
the state to talk to 
corporate leaders 
about providing 
students with high-
wage jobs," 
Connerly said. 

Connerly and 
Morrisroe an: plan-
ning a high-profile

According to

agreed to host a 
luncheon with 
business leaders to

"Not only is this providing em-
ployment, but it's also reconnect· 
ing us with the public, which is 
just as important as this university 
undergoes its transformation," he 
added. 

The inilialive gained theenthu-
siastic support of Student Regent 
Darby Morrisroe, who will work 
with Connerly to publice the pro-
gram. " As California's businesses 
and industries perhaps benefit the 
most from an educated work force, 
they should 'give back' to the in-
stitution that provides them with 
such excellent human resources," 
Morrisroe said.

UC Regent Connerly, who 
was appointed ~y 

Gov. Wilson to the Board of Re-
gents last year, said he came up 
with the idea for the Student Em-
ployment Initi.ative when he at-
tended his first regents' meeting. 

When he heard Morrisroe talk 
about the problems that indepen-
dent students were facing in fi· 
nancing their education, Connerly 
said he began to think about ways 
the Board of Regents could "ease 
the pain." 

As a low-income student who 
had to pay his own way through 
Cal State Sacramento, Connerly 
said that he would not have been 
able to attend college under the 
conditions tbat many students are 
facing today.

UCSD Joins Organ Donor Program 
The UnIverIIly of CalIfamJa Board of ReaentB last 

FrIday authorized the OIP' and TIssue Acquisition 
Center (OTAe) to mcMI forward In Its effofts to establish 
a bkIatIonai orpn donation program In lluana, MexIco. 

this Initial approval means that OTAe, which Is 
based at the UCSD Medical CerQr, can beCln workq 
with hospitals In Mexico to develop a fonnal proposal 
to submit to Mexico's Minister of Health. 

If the proposal Is approved, organs recovered 
ttvou&h the program wi. be available for transplant&-
tIon In Mexico and sf San DJe&o's three transplant 
centers. 

OTAe, a Social Security Hospital, and the Cruz 
Roja Mexicans Hospital will form a 'no~ civil 
association based In Tijuana, a necessary step In 
developll1l a final proposal to submit to the Minister 
of Health. 

The association will manace the orpn recovery 
~m and report results to the Proerama Nacional 
de Transplantes In Mexico City. 

Thousands of people die each ye. awaltl. OIIan 
transplants In the United States and Mexico because 
of a lack of available organs. Many of these patients 
could potentially benefit fJom the proposed bi-national 
organ donation program, which would make more 
organs available to patients on both sides of the 
border. In the United States, It Is estimated that a 
transplant candidate dies f!NfJIY to.. hours waltl. for 
a suitable orpn. 

Transplant IUIJ8IY In the United States Is a well-
establlahed treatment ~ for patients with ~ 
stace 0tIII'I failure. However, the number of available 
organs has not been able to keep up with the rlsll1l 
number of tranIpIant candidates. 

James Cutler, executive director of OTAe, seld, 
"we stIH have several hurdles and potential concerns 
to overcome; however, we are confident that we can be 
successful, workil1l with coIleIes and supporters In 
MexIco."

With rhe col/apse of communism. liberal economic and political theory have assumed the status of unquestionable tru.th 

The Triumph of Liberalism, Revisited 
Much discussed but little un-derstood, the oonclusion of the Cold War has been 
characterized as rock-solid proof for 
the validity of liberal economic and 
political theory - the new, generally 
approvedwaytounderstandtheworld. 
With the oollapse of the Eastern Bloc, 
grand and fatalislictalkofliberalism's 
historical asccndency abounds: the 
"triumph of capitalism," the "end of 
ideology," the "end of history." But 
the "great sea change" is simply a 
reorganization and a change in the 
conventional mode of global conflict, 
not a radical shift. 

Most notable about Cold War ide-
ology is Ihat both brands shared key 
assumptions (both superpowers 
complicitly maintained the assump-
tion that the West iscapitalism and the 
East is socialism) which were essen-
lial ideological justifications for the 
very prac;ticaland cynical business of 
conflict. Outside of the Cold War con-
text, it is evident that both East and 
West diverpd quite radicaDy from 
their IIIIed ideologies - enough to 
re .. ntric:dyidd .:alexplanllions 
fA this conflict queationable. 

BY ELY •• BANI,STAFF WRITER 

But the ascendant wisdom now 
emphatically states that the effective 
has triumphed over the regressive, in 
accord with the natural orderofthings. 
With cries of Cold War victory, the 
champions ofliberal theory lay claim 
to the victors' spoil - the cultural 
capital - with lhe very practical goal 
of joining a new offensive. 

This cultural capital is a reinvigo-
rated hegemony, ideology given the 
new status of scientifically understood, 
rigorously applied natural principle, a 
kind of economysticism. It is a value 
system that claims an empirical foun· 
dation, a goal given an imperative 
status and ascribed inevitability -
the same sort .of inevitability that 
Marxist theory claimed for socialism. 

That the American system bears 
only superficial resemblance to a free 
market is beside the point. Uberal 
theory is the sales pitch (at gunpoint, 
the brink of starvation or both) for the 
bitter pill of playing ball , of 
privatization, _rity andThalcherite 
monetarism. We are Globocop and 
the Global Village Idiot in one, 10 our 
fairy tale goea. 

l..ibaaI theoryofpoliticaleconomy 

depends upon several logical steps, 
each of which is flawed and either 
untestable or empirically falsified. 
Nonetheless, each assertion is beyond 
question. And the victors use more 
than hegemony to enforce compli-
ance on lhe intemationallevel - this 
is what the International Monetary 
Fund (IMf)austerity programs, inter-
national credits and trade policies are 
all about. 

Thespokespeoplefor liberal theory 
assert that when thoroughly practiced, 
market economic principles - the 
invisible hand, the great geisl of capi-
talism - will inevitably lead to opti-
mal economic outoomes. 1t is argued, 
with little proof but with frequent 
repetition, that a competitive system 
exerts an irresistable drive toward 
maximum econom ic eftkiency, even 
when it is unclear how "efficiency" is 
best measured .. 

The core argument of free-market 
economics is that when cc:onomk: 
activity is left eo itself, free of coer-
cion, competition (i.e. between ICII-
ers for buyen' money and amona 
buyers for .,00. and a.v .. ) en-
BUrell an economic balance. At this 

point of equilibrium, supply matches 
demand and goods are supposed to be 
priced at their proper value. This 
mechanism is thus thought to provide 
an efficient distribution of goods and 
a just valuation of all oommodities. 

Competition supposedly drives pr0-
ducers to meet the needs of their mar-
kel,competingon features,quality and 
price. Competition always ensures 
consumers ofbetlcr, cheaper and more 
abundant mouse traps. 

Economic agents are presumed to 
always act according to rational self-
interest and only enler into transac-
tions which are mutually benefICial. 
Those not uphold the right rationality 
are incapable and just not fit enough to 
survive. Since only beneficial transac-
tions take place, all economic activity 
is taken to work in the interest of 
society. 

Though usually prcsentcdua Iogi-
cally necessary, empirically demon-
strated rault, free-market theory re-
ally amounts to an articJe of faith, 
used subsequently a an interpretive

normative, a moral system • weD a 
a Id of COIIVCIIIionI for cWinina the 

world. Exclusion of all but individual 
oorwiderations is thus said to lead to 
the best individual and collective out-
oomes, better than direct attempts 
(market "intervention") based on a 
oonception of the greater good. 

While one may imagine some of 
the principles invoked in this scheme, 
build mathematical models of them 
and even point to some real-world 
instances, on the whole it is far from 
clearthat it works as advertised. Rather 
than necessary Iron Laws of nature, 
market principles are abstractions that 
canonly cohere in an idealized system. 

Competition is rarely as refined 
as imagined: it is tempered by con· 
solidation of industry. Short-term 
profit maximizing strategies often 
render long-term responsibility in· 
viable. 

Distortions of v.ale arise because 
actiona of larger entities can have 
much more weight than those of 
smaller economic actors, even in

COMMENTARY: Be they subtle irritability or violent outbreak, all roommate disputes are centered around food 

DAVID 

SJ1II1II 

Dishea are the root of 
aU evil. Many dilltnugbt 
roommates and shell-
shocked RAs do nol 
know Ibis, but a carefuJ . 
analysis of all roommate 
mnfiids find their gen-
esis in one of Man's pri-
mal instincts: hunger. 

If it weren'l for the 
fact thai a11l1udenlapert-
mcnt dweUm must share 
a kitcben, we would all 
gel along. Your room-

mate chants satanic mantras all night? Wear 
earplup. Your~-mateboldswhitepower 
rallies in the I ivins room? Rdrelt to your room. 
Evenpeoplewithdiametricallyopposilelifestylc:a 
can live in relative isolation within the same 
apartment - excepc when it comes to food. 

Yes, Man's need to ingest food can ruin an 
otherwise peaceful apartment atmosphere. You 
cannot simply keep your milk under the bed, for 
example. Instead, you must keep it in the com-
munity refrigerator to be lusted af'Icr by a fiend-
ish apartment-mate. And using your pot to make 
soup is so much less appealing when it still 
oontains the remnants of Iwo-day-old mac and 
cheese. And what to do when you find pieces of 
tuna in the margarine? These aredifficull pr0b-
lems we all have faad. 

Of course, people with varyins degrees of 
messiness and tolerance make the mayhem all 
the more complex. Most studenls have one of 
four basic types of kitchen personalities.

Type I has a troubled 
soul. These people will 
wash thcirdishc:a, wash your 
dishes and wash dishes 
when they go to someone 
else's apartment. They 
scream if they see you us-
ing a fork in a Teflon pan. 
They advocalcextensive Ia-
belins policies on all plates 
and food. They say things 
like, "Bob, I was disturbed 
to notice that your jar of 
mustard was on my shelf. I 
think we need to talk. " 

"'~.U .... to 
r..olYe contIcts 

Type III is slightly more 

that reYOlve ...... 
the ldtcIIen, they 
..ldomwOlk. 

Of course, the most sen-
sationalapartmcntdisputes, 
ones which include assauh 
and battery,always involve 

territorial. These students realize that they are 
responsible for their pots, their dishes and the 
utensim that went into the preparation of their 
rneaIs. However, they also believe that placing 
these items in the sink will have a magic c1earw-
ing effect on them. Type Ills will oonsiderately 
take your clean pan, soil it with egg and cheese 
residue and leave it to attract varmints for the 
next two weeks in the sanctity of the apartment 
sink. Strangely, they won't use it again until you 
wash it. 

Type II is the dull, uncreative sort. These 
people always do their dishes and don't com-
plain much. In fact, they seem a tad anal until 

Type IV and Type I students. The logical thing, 
one might suppose, would be to group apart-
ments by type, but this method also has its 
problems. 

The Health Department would have to shut 
down any apartment inhabited by three or more 
Type IVs. And there are no sinks big enough to 
hold all the dishes that would accumulate in a 
Type III apartment. Finally, too many strange 
religious cults would arise from Type I apart-
ments. 

Of oourse, the most stable kind of apartment 
would be one filled with people who always did 
their own dishes, were oonsidcrate with food 

andcleanlinessandnevergotonanyone'snetVes, 
much like Type lis. Unfortunately, Type II 
personalities are quite rare. 

There are a number of strategies used to 
resolve oonOicts that revolve around the kitdlen 
(as aU conflids do), but they seldom wort. The 
first is to reduce the amount of kitchen matcriaIs 
available to be soiled. If there are four people in 
the house, there should be four forks. The only 
problem with this arrangement is that if one 
roommate uses two spoons andacupfora music 
project, IIOmeone goes without ooffee for a 
quarter. 

Then there's that childish mcthodof labcling 
food and utensils. You must remember that your 
creepy roommate with the bubonic plague is 
going to slug-lip your Coke even if you write 
your name on it. . 

Finally, some people try tact and politeness 
in dcialing with messy kitchen problems. Under 
no circumstances does this ever work. Don't try 
it. A typical scenario of this approach might be 
you asking your apartment-mate to kindly re-
move luncheon meat from the wall. If this is a 
male apartment, you will be perceived as a soft, 
willowy niMY who doesn't appreciate true 
manliness. If it is a female apartment, you are a 
manipulative, inserwitive bitch who cannot ap-
preciate the pressures thatd{Ove your roommate 
to place that luncheon meat on the wall in the 
first place. 

l£the most important task in oollege is to teach 
tolerance and enlightenment, the most fertile 
ground for this education is in the kitchens of 
student apartments. Can'l we all just get along?

ESPIONAGE Nar VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAw 
EdItor: 

I must take issue with Andrew 
Reynold's Jan. 13 World View com-
menruy ("One Law for Ua, Another 
For Them"). In his piece. he discusses 
the behavior ofWestem democracies 
and their alleged hypocritical attitudes 
toward international law and human 
rights. He goes into detail about three 
cases, in particular: the French de-
strud ion of the Greenpeac:e ship, Rain-
bow Warrior; the Johnathon Pollard 
espionage case; and the U.S. training 
of Salvadoran soldiers involved in the 
EI MOlOte massacre. 

Specifically, I have a problem with 
his treatment of the Pollard case. 
Somehow he feels that the Israeli con-
duct in this case was a violation of 
international law. On the contrary, 
while the Israeli actions may have 
been foolish and a betrayal of trust 
between two close allies, they were 
not a violation of international law. 
There are no intemationallaws what-
soever which prohibit espionage ac-
tivities, which we often called the 
world's second~ldest profession. All 
nations spy on one another in some 
fashion and the United States, with its 
estimated $30 billion dollar intelli-
gence budget, is second to none. 

It is also interesting that Mr. 
Reynolds claims that the infonnation 
leaked by Mr. Pollard led to the deaths 
of U.S. agents in the Soviet Union (a 
ract based on unspecified "CIA evi-
dence." One wonders whether he 
would accept CIA evidence on the 
events surrounding EI Mozote). For if 
Mr. Pollard, and by implication, Is-
rael, was involved in spying and this is 
a violation of international law , then 
wouldn't the u.s. agents be guilty as 
well? 

While I share Mr. Reynold's out-
rage over the French involvement in 
the destruction of the Rainbow War-
rior, agree that the conduct of the 
United States showed a lack of re-
spect for human rights and condemn

smaller economic actors, even in ag-
gregate. Competition frequently yields 
only a marginal selection - the dif-
ference between products X and Y is 
usually slight In rapidly changing 
markets it is unlikely that equilibrium 
(the definition of market fairness) is 
ever reached. 

More fundamental is the question 
of what gets measured as value and 
what is considered fair. Though qual-
ity oflife is not measured, an arbitrary 
monetary value is often attached to it. 

At the limit, everything becomes 
commodified and subordinated to the 
market. At present, these include hu-
man labor, education, health, envi-
ronmental quality and biodiversity 
and, in many parts of the world, vital 
organs. Everything has a price tag, 
everything is for sale. 

Under the market system, the en-
vironment is made into a commodity 
- placed in a social category -
which predisposes economic actors 
to exploit it to uninhabitability, frus-
trating attempts at preservation.

Co-op has Bad 
Customer Relation. 
EdItor: 

I have always thought that thecam-
pus Food Co~p was a good idea. 
UntilJan.12, that is. On that day,a trip 
to the co-op resulted in my being 
treated in a shockingly insolent man-
ner by a worker who identified him-
self as being in charge. Rather than 
attempt to answer a customer request, 
this individual treated me with con-
tempt. When asked later toexplain his 
behavior, he pleaded innocence on 
the grounds that he was "mirroring" 
my approach. 

A basic tenet of customer relations 
is that store workers do not escalate a 
situation, but seek to understand the 
customer's point of view and, if nec-
essary, explain politely why the cus-
tomer cannot be accommodated. 

adverse to their well-being. The mar-
ket conditions peoples' material sur-
vival. 

But liberal theory is about more 
than economics, To ensure that market 
transactions are not fonnally coen:ed, 
this theory defines and reserves space 
for certain formal individual rights. 
The only legitimate role of the state is 
to protect these rights and thus the 
ordert Y function of the market. 

This is rather different from de-
mocracy. These spcciflC formal rights, 
which largely relate to property rights 
and the enforcement of contracts, are 
held to favor the emergence of politi-
cal democracy, while their absence 
(property rights in particular) is held 
to threaten any existing democracy or 
preclude its development. Neither 
logical necessity nor empircal evi-
dence backs these claims. 

There are numerous countries 
which are controlled by clearly un-
democratic regimes that nonetheless 
extend property rights. These include 
Mexico, Israel, Northern Ireland, 
Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines 
and South Africa. Thc:se examples are 
oountries which have "been making 
progress," but for reasons which are 
not related to free-market economies 
or property rigllls.

Conservative. are 
Underrepre .. nted 
EdItor: 

We are concerned about the selec-
tion process for a new name for Fifth 
College. It is understandable that onl y 
women's names . are being consid-
ered, as there are few colleges cur-
rently named after women. However, 
conservatives are even more 
underrepresented than women as col-
lege namesakes. Why are there no 
conservative women under consider-
ation? 

We propose that Fifth College be 
renamed Margaret Thatcher College. 
True to Fifth's concentration on inter-
national relations, Mrs. Thatcher has 
done far more on an international 
level than any of the five women 
currently under consideration. 

Some have suggested that only a 
dead woman maybeconsidered,since 
live women may still do something 
that would embarrass a college. We 
~ure you that Margaret Thatcher is a 
woman of such dignity and grace that 
this is unthinkable. However, if only 
dead women can be selected, we pr0-
pose that Fifth College retain its cur-
rent name until Mrs. Thatcher passes.

of radical market reforms, informed 
by precisely this kindofliberallheory, 
has been vigorously applied in the 
Russian Federation. A wholesale 
privatization scheme has primarily 
enriched the old apparat. The same 
people who mismanaged the Soviet 
economy now own the reins. 

Economic "shock therapy" -
worse than the malady - and 
privatization have led to near-collapse 
of economic functioning. The provid-
ers of international aid and the IMF 
have pressured for the most radical 
reforms. 

Multinational c:orpotations have 
taken advantage of the highly favor-
able ventures these reforms made pos-
sible - a leveraged buyout on the 
scale of a fonner superpower, Stan-
dards of living have fallen well bel-
low those of the bad old days, fueling 
the popular resentment that gave 
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party such parliamentary 
power. 

Beyond this immediate, but still 
minor, threat of fascism is another 
unfortunate consequence of liberal

FEHTUHES "[MUD] is a hybrid be-tween dungeons and dragons and a fiction novel in that it is 
interactive fiction. There is a 

paper and entering the storm, the wild west 
of electronic communication, the Internet. 
With colleges and universities at the fore-
front of the new communications technol-
ogy, more students are logging in to the joys 
of the electronic wilderness. 

Sujata Shende, a communicatIons major 
at Fifth College, uses Internet to send elec-
tronic mail to friends and family across the 
country. She started logging in at the begin-
ning of last quarter. 

"I thought it would be cool to communi-
cate instantaneously. You don ' t have to 
wait for the mail," she said. 

Barry Brown, a UCSD graduate student 
who works at the Computing Services Cen-
ter, used the Intcrnet two years ago to en-
gage in group conversations through Multi-
User Dungeon or Dimension (MUD). 

"It was a social gathering in which one 
could pretend to be anything [he] wanted to 
be," he said. "We created a fictitious city, in , 
which participants could own houses and 

~ 

set up environment and it's 
just up to you [to] explore it and feel it," he 
added. 

When he's not on the net at work, Brown 
uses the Internet to read electronic mail and 
"poke around" in a program called Mosaic, 
which contains information such as music 
lyrics, recipes and scientific discoveries. 

What began in the 1960s as the U.S. 
government's technical mode of communi-
cation for Defense Department researchers 
is becoming the fastest-growing telecom-
munications system ever built. 

An estimated 15 million people in 50 
countries use Internet, and the traffic seems 
to be increasing by as much as 15 percent a 
month. 

According to the Wall Street Journal, 
the increase in popularity is due to Internet's 
roots in colleges and universities, which 
started offering e-mail to their students over 
the past decade. As the students graduated, 
they took their e-mail habit into the outside 
world.

F~ Policy Approved Amid Protest 
REGENTS: Students 
assail policy which 
could mean higher fees 
By PhIlIp Mlc ...... 
News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO - Fees 
could be going up for the next 
several years after the University 
of California Board of Regents 
approved the UC Officc of the 
President's controversial long-
term fee proposal on Thursday, in 
spite of calls from students to de-
lay the vote until another proposal 
could b~ drafted. 

As four students chanted "post-
pone the dtcision," the regents' com-
mitteeoo finance voted 7-2 to adopt 
the fee proposal known asthe Guide-
lines Model. Under this plan, en-
dorsed by UC President Jack 
Peltason, an Educational Fee would 
be assessed to all students through-
out the UCsystem. The fee'sannual 
level would be based on the cost of 
maintaining quality, and revenue 
generated from the fee would be 
used to fund costs directly related to 
instruction. 

In addition, the university 
would assess a Registration Fee, 
which would pay for such areas as 
student health services, psycho-
logical counseling and social and 
cultural activities. The rate of the 
Registration Fee will be deter-
mined by each chancellor and will 
vary from campus to campus. . 

.. "To put it briefly, we will offer 
a high-quality education at a rea-
s(>Rable price," said UC Provost 
Walter E. Massey. "Students from 
families that are able to pay will be 
expected to pay and students from 
families that are not able to pay the 
full fee will be assisted through

ContInued from ..... 1 

The budget also restores the 3.5 
perccnt pay cut that faculty and 
staff underwent last year. To re-
store the salaries, Peltason said that 
the university will have to cut its 
budget by an additional $53 mil-
lion next year. Even with the in-
crease in pay, UC faculty salaries 
remain 7.5 percent lower than at 
comparable institutions, Massey 
said. 

"I want to stress that the budget 
I am recommending today is ab-
solutely essential if we are going

our financial aid programs." 
Students immediately at-

tacked the proposal as identical 
to the current manner in which 
the university assesses fees. "We 
want and need a long-term fee 
policy that guarantees financial 
aid, but doesn't guarantee fee 
increases. What ,the regents just 
passed is just the opposite," said 
A.S. Vice President External 
Nick Endres. 

Regent Ward Connerly, who 
along with Student Regent Darby 
Morrisroc cast the only dissenting 
votes, criticized the proposal for 
forcing students out of the univer-
sity. "I just think fundamentally 
[the policy] moves us away from 
being an education trust to being 
an educational enterprise," he said. 

According to Connerly, as fees

(lOntinue to risc, the lawsofsupply 
and demand dictate that fewer stu-
dents will attend the University of 
California. "I hope and pray what 
we have done here works, and I 
will do my best II' ease the pain. 
But I really think what we're do- ' 
ing is defying the laws of econom-
ics," Connerly added. 

In a move meant to ameliorate 
students' displeasure, but which 
many regents conceded was 
merely a cosmetic alteration, the 
board voted to drop the words 
"long term" from the policy. The 
change means that the regents will 
assess fees from year to year rather 
than develop a long-range plan. 

"We did not want to imply by the 
term 'long term' that we were (lOm-
mitted to any other policy bu! keep-
ing fees as low as possible," said 
Board Chairman Howard Leach. 

But for the most part, the re-
gents defended their new policy as 
the best alternative for dllaling with 
the budget crisis. "As painful as 
this policy decision is to everyone 
in this room, this board must take 
whatever steps necessary to main-
tain quality," said Faculty Repre-

. sentative Daniel Simmons. 
Students who spoke at the re-

gents' meeting also criticized the 
board for not giving them a proper 
hearing. "They completely disre-
garded us. They didn't address our 
problems," said UC Davis student 
Irma Munoz . 

Massey, however, disputed the 
idea that the students did not have 
enough of a chance to state their 
casco "We have been discussing 
this for over a year. We have been 
discussing this with students and 
with faculty. So "that's just not 
true," Massey said.

to stabilize the university and save 
it from slipping out of the first 
rank," Peltason said. 

Peltason dubbed the budget a 
"share-tile-pain plan" which relies 
on three parts to overcome the 
university 's shortfall. Besides the 
fee hikes, the university will also 
reI yon state funding and the reduc-
tion offaculty and staff through the 
UC's early-retirement program. 

Student leaders blasted the bud-
get, criticizing the fee hikes for 
putting the cost of a UC education 
out of the reach oflow- and middle-
income families. "For every $100 
our fees are raised, five students 
drop out of school. That'. five 
students too many," said Irma 
Mulloz, a sludent from UC Davia 
who ipOke at the meeting. 

Peltuon dismilled charJeI that 
the budget placed. an unfair bur-
den on sludcnta. ·We hear a lot of 
critic:ism that the studenll have 
lIhouldered moat of the burden of 

the budget cuts. This is just not the 
case - although students have 
certainly shared in the pain, and 
it 's been real pain that they shared 
in, along with faculty and staff," 
Peltason said. 

The budget picture could 
worsen by May when the gover-
nor releases his revised budget 
figures. Traditionally, the May re-
vised budget is much bleaker than 
the one approved in January. 

"What you have just heard is 
the most optimistic version of the 
budget," said Regent William T. 
Bagley. 

The governor's budget depends 
upon the state receiving approxi-
mately $3 billion in federal aid. If 
thai aid is not providld, the uni-
versily could flCC more fee hikes, 
pay cull and layoffs.

ANALYSIS: 
UC officials make 
quality top priority 
ContInued from ,... 1 

"A UCdegreewill not be worth 
much in the future if we let quality 
slide when times are tough," said 
UC Vice President William B. 
Baker. 

"Maintaining the quality of the 
University of California is what 
this budget is all about," Peltason 
added. 

For the past few years, univer-
sity administrators have seemed 
like jugglers, forced to give equal 
attention to quality, access and 
affordability, trying to simulta-
neously satisfy the needs of stu-
dents, faculty, staff, politicians and 
the pub I ic. But as Cali fornia ' 5 eco-
nomic condition has failed to im-
prove, the jugglers at the UC Of-
fice of the President have found 
themselves unable to keep all the 
balls in the air. Something had to 
give. And at last week's regent 
meeting, something did. 

At UC San Francisco last Thurs-
day and Friday, maintaining qual-
ity assumed top priority in the 
hearts and minds of Peltason and 
the Board of Regents, while ac-
cess has, for the moment at least, 
been placed on the back burner. 
Mistake. of tile Pat 

The first sign that the univer-
sity was changing its approach to 
the budget crisis came during 
Peltason's address to the Board 
of Regents on Thursday. While 
assessing the budget picture for 
the coming year, Peltason con-
ceded that university officials had 
made a mistake bY'seeking quick-
fix solutions for a long-term prob-
lem. 

" It is true, as our critics charge, 
that we were slow to comprehend 
the depth and duration of 
California's fiscal problems," 
Peltason said. 

"We took temporary measures 
at first because we did not want to 
take permanent and possibly dam-
aging actions just to solve a short-
term problem," he added. "That 
seemed prudent at the time, even 
though hindsight tells us that it 
was overly optimistic." 

Peltason is not the only person 
in the university to come to this 
conclusion. Many administrators' 
have tacitly admitted that the UC's 
early retirement program, VERIP, 
has created more problems than it 
alleviated. 

While VERIP has eased the 
budget strain by reducing the num-

possibility of a complete restruc-
turing of the currently submitted 
document were also presented. 

Convention chair pro tem and 
former A.S. Vice President Exter-
nal Siamak Malek proposed the 
creation of sub-committees re-
sponsible for the research and de-
velopment of specific portions of 
the conSlitution. 

"Oneofour purposes should be 
to create the best working model 
that we could make with our own 
resources," Malek said. "We 
[could) take the constitution and 
break sections of it up into com-
mittees.... . If we 11M committees

tive thi,.g." 

ber of employees, it has also de-
pleted the faculty and staff at each 
of the nine campuses, creating 
larger workloads for those who 
remain behind. 

"AfterVERIP III, we expect to 
have about 10 percent fewer fac-
ulty, but only three percent fewer 
students. In addition to having 
more students, faculty must often 
do their own secretarial work due 
to staff cuts in the instructional 
departments, " Massey said. 

Clearly, university officials 
expect the state's economic woes 
to continue for quite some time. 
And even if the economic picture 
does brighten, the amount of state 
funding the university receives 
isn 't ~~fCCted to increase. 
A Dlfftcult Solution 

Given these constraints, the 
Office of the President has opted 
for a solution that will no longer 
attempt to please everyone in the 
UC system. For now, university 
officials are prepared to sacrifice 
other qualities that were once held 
sacrosanct - accessibility, for 
instance - as long as they believe 
that the quality of education is 
being preserved. 

"Let me emphasize that we will 
not be doing the state or our stu-
dents a favor if we pursue a policy 
of sacrificing quality in order to 
maintain low fees," said Massey, 
as he presented the Office of the 
President's long-term fee policy. 

Thecontroversial policy, which 
was approved by the Board of 
Regents last week, is an example 
of the university's new commit-
ment to preserving the quality of 
instruction. 

Among other changes, the new 
fee policy will assess a system-
wide Educational Fee, which will 
be detennined by, in Massey's 
words, "what is needed to main-
tain quality." The fee would be 
raised or lowered depending upon 
what the university needs to cover 
the costs of instruction. 

By the standards of UC offi-
cials, the fee policy is essential. 
Besides preserving the quality the 
administrators so desperately de-
sire, this year's boost in fees is 
helping to restore a 3.S percent 
pay cut suffered by faculty and 
staff last year. Peltason said re-
storing the pay cut is mandatory if 
the university hopes to retain its 
highly-respected faculty. 

But even with these benefits, 
the fee policy has its share of crit-
ics. Student Regent Darby 
Morrisroeestimated that the policy 
could lead to fee hikes in excess of 
$600 for each of the next aeveral 

Students brought up issues in-
cluding increased student involve-
ment with the A.S., legal au-
tonomy and financial indepen-
dence from administration, im-
proved relations with faculty and 
staff and a communistic structure 
during the brainstormingaession, 
but could not generate any con-
crete resolutions. 

"I think that it 's good [that) 
members of the Constitutional 
Convention are living themselves 
the opportunity to discuss this," 
said A.S. Vice President Adminis-
trative John Barnes. "The down-
side is some students have been 
visibly turned off by the lack of 
order and have left the conven-
tion. 

"The future of the A.S. is beinS 
decided by a small JfOUP of stu-
dents workin, in a dilOl'derly, non-
democratic fashion," Barnes 
added. "We're tslkin,about a lot 

Monda" J-....., 24. 19M 
years_ In addition, Morriaroe his 
criticized the policy for liceuiag 
deficit speadiDJ. 

Accordiag to Board of Reaents 
<lIair Howard r....cb, tile fee policy 
is typical of the dilemma facing 
universities in the present eco-
nomic climate. "You never have 
enough 'funds to pay for faculty 
and administration. You can never 
keep fees low enough," Leach said. 
"But I think this university is do-
ing the best [it] can." 
V .... ofDl ••• nt 

.Not everybody is as convinced 
as Leach, even among his fellow 
regents. Regent Ward Connerly, 
who voted against the long-term 
fee policy and the proposed fee 
hikes, fears that the university is 
maki ng a grave mistake by relying 
on student fees to cover its budget-
ary shortfalls. 

"When you look at education 
as a commodity, the rules of eco-
nomics apply. As we raise fees, 
we force people out of the mar-
ket," Connerly said. 

Even regents who voted in fa-
vor of the fee policy expressed 
some doubts. Regent Meredith 
Khachigian suggested that the new 
fee policy and the university 's 

.complex financial aid system 
would be a serious hardship for 
"the great middle class." . 

UC Berkeley Physics Profes-
sor Charles Schwartz, a self-de-
scribed "gadfly" to the Board of 
Regents, is even more dubious 
about the university 'scommitment 
to quality. 

"The word 'quality' needs to 
be dissected. My interpretation is 
that [the Board of Regents] is pre-
serving the bloated quality of ad-
ministration .... Undergraduate 
education is at the bottom ofits list 
of real funding priorities," 
Schwartz said. 

University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) Repre-
sentative Kari Becker said that the 
university should be focusing on 
cost-containment as a budget cri-
sis solution rather than fee hikes. 

"My hope is that with alterna-
tives like the onea I've mentioned 
and with other coat-c:ontainment 
measures, the university will be 
able to provide that education to 
the next generation." Becker told 
the Board of Regents on Thurs-
day. 

But for now, the university is 
committed to along-nRge policy 
of preserving quality above aU else. 
"I can't think of anything more 
damaging to our students than to 
allow the deterioration of quality 
to continue," Peltason said. 

of generalizations here, but my 
question is, when ia a constitution 
going to be written?" 

Constitution co-author Valen-
tine was displeased with the 
convention's progress on Thurs-
day. 

"I personally think we should 
stick with the constitution we have. 
We should start with a basic frame-
work and amend from there," Val-
entine said. 

On a more optimistic note, A.S. 
Vice President External Nick 
Endres said there is a need to de-
velop a constitution that will.trike 
a balance between a rigid struc-
ture and one that allows for ex- ~ 
pansion. 

"What we're struggling with is 
IOmething that facilitates both. 
Hopefully whaa came out of to-
niabt wu a structure that will be

Continued from .... e 20 
(I :45.32), and the lOO-meter free 
(47. 13). 

Teammate Andrew Hollywood 
dominated as well, finishi ng the day 
with a first- and-second place fin-
ish. The sophomore cruised toa win 
in the 2oo-meter backstroke 
(1:57.55) and finished just behind 
Millerint}!e IOO-meterback(54.7). 

Freshman Justin Kitagawa con-
tinued to impress, seizing a win in 
the lOO-meter butterfly (53.91). 

Junior Erik Pederson and senior 
Chris Iagard were unstoppable in 
the 1000meter breaststroke, taking 
first and second with times of 1 :01.15 
and I :01.55, respectively. 

Iunior Ieffrey Kudo posted an 
insunnountable 2: 13.98 in the 200-
meter breast to win that event.

Emmitt Smith did the same - he 
didn't play like a man with a sepa-
rated shoulder. His 144 yards of 
total offense settled the game in the 
first half as Dallas ran up 28 points. 
The Cowboys finished the game 
without Emmilt or Troy Aikman but 
coasted home over San Francisco.

Senior John Flowers swam well, 
notching two second-place finishes. 
His time of 21.83 in the SO-meter 
free was just a hair off of the first-
place time of 21.41. 

The UCSD women didn't notch 
quite as many quality performances 
against Industry Hills. 

Junior Christina Galdos swam 
well, recording a solid 1:00.79 in 
the 1000meterfreestyle, giving hera 
third·place finish. Galdos garnered 
another third in the 200-meter but· 
terfly (2: 16.87). 

Junior Diane Wegienkaoutlasted 
most of her opponents in the 1650-
meter freestyle, capturing second 
place (18:37.62}. 

Heather McPherson continued 
her outstanding freshman season 
with eye-catching third place ef-
forts in the 200 and 500-meter 
freestyle events. turning in times of 
2:00.44 in the 200 and a 5:17.97 in 
the ~OO.

Steve, or maybe even to watch Buf-
falo get stomped by one of the few 
remaining NFC teams they haven' t 
lost to in a Super Bowl. But I will 
not endure Son of Dallas-Buffalo. 

Why the despair? Because the 
greatest thi ng in the world is a close, 
hard-fought, do-or-die football 
game. I need my butt on the edge of 
my seat, the outcome twisting in the 
wind. I need the adrenaline fix, and 

.1 never get it at the Super Bowl. 
And if Hell freezes over, if Buf-

falo wins, then I' II buy a video of the 
thing and absorb it fully. Atipo' the 
cap to the perseverance of the Bills . . 
Every dog has his day. My own 
private Super Bowl will have to be

AN UPDATE ON WHAT YOUR ASSOCIATED 
STUDENTS COUNCIL HAS BEEN UP TO 

THAT'S RIGHT, YOU! 
The Associated Students is YOUR 
organ ization. The AS Council consists 
of elected and appointed officials 
whose job it is to ensure that students' 
interests are met on th is campus and 
system wide. For the Council to be 
effect ive it must be accountable to you . 
You are encouraged to bring your 
opinions and advice to Council meet-
ings. held every Wednesday night at 
6 :30pm on the third floor of the Price 
Center. Or just stop by the AS offices 
anytime or call 534-4450 . The Council 
wants to hear your comments and 
suggestion !>! 

A FEW SUCCESSES 
Following is a list of just a few of the 
accomplishments of this year's Council 
so far: 

o C O -OP NEGOTIATIONS 
The CO·OPs olay an important role on 
this campus. It gives students a 
needed financial break on items 
ranging from school supplies and 
books to a wide rage of healthy foods . 
Addit ionally, the CO-OPs provide an 
Important educational experience to 
the employees and patrons . The 
Associated Students is dedicated to 
keeping this important service on 
campus . The AS was integral in ending 
the long·standing dispute between the 
CO-OPs and the administration. After 
nine months of grueling negotiations, 
the CO-OPs, administration. Associated 
Student s. and Graduate Student 
Association signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding which will help ensure 
that st udent run services remain on 
campus for at least the next five years . 
The Associated Students are proud to 
have been involved in keeping these 
incredibly valuabe services in the 
Student Center. 

e SMITH V. REGENTS 
The recent Supreme Court decision in 
the Smith v. Regents case prevents the 
Associated Students from funding any 
student organization deemed political. 
religious, or ideological. This decision 
has placed an enormous burden on the 
Associated Students by forcing the 
Council to decide which student 
organizations are eligible for funding. 
The Council created the Student 
Organization Funding Eligibility Board to 
determine the eligibility of every 
organization on campus. Although 
funding for Winter quarter has been 
slightly delayed. most student organiza-
tions will be able to obtain money from 
the Associated Students. UCSD Is the 
only UC school to provide funds to 
student organizations for Winter 
quarter. 

• STUDENT AurONOMY 
The Associated Students maintains a 
firm commitment to student autonomy 
and Is currently negotiating the Issue 
with the administration. Student 
autonomy would grant the Associated 
Students various rI&hU and responsi-
bilities, the most Important of which Is 
control over our own funds. ThIs Is an 
Important first step In bfInCInC power to 

the students. Only a few minor issues 
still need to be wo~ed out with the 
administration. 

o CONSTITUTIONAL 
CONVENTION 

After years of trying. the Constitutional 
Convention is finally underway. The 
convention is attempting to draft a 
more coherent and efficient constitu-
tion to govern the way the Associated 
Students is operated. This is an 
extremely Important event and all 
students are encouraged to participate. 
Meetings are held every Monday at 
9 :00pm on the third floor of the Price 
Center and are open to the public. 
This document will effect you. so 
please give your input. 

~ SHOPPING SHU'ITLE

a shuttle to take students to and from 
the superma~et. Call 534-4450 for

Stanford Ices Triton Skaters, 9-0 
ByTedd Ladd 
Guardian Reporter 

Put yourselfin UCSD ice hockey 
Head Coach Gary Androssi' s skates. 
Imagine having absolutely no idea 

NCE 
/'., •.. ; .. " 

/ /\' 
HOCKEV 

who's going 
to be able to 
attend prac-
tices, much 
less suit up 
for the next 
game. 

UCSD 
hockey has 
taken its 
share of 
lumps, but 
perhaps its 
most devas-

tating setback has been the lack of 
able bodies due to injuries, academ-
ics, graduation and dropouts. 

"I don't know who can come on 

the road trip to USC on Monday," 
Androssi said. "Some of our guys 
have midterms the next day." 

Most of the team showed up Fri-
day night for the showdown against 
Stanford University at the San Di-
ego Sports Arena. 

The overmatched Tritons lost 
handily to the Cardinal, 9-0, drop-
ping their seasonal record to a dis-
appointing 1-4-1. 

The loss of half ofUCSD' s start-
ers, including five on offense, clearly 
hindered the team's scoring attack 
against Stanford. 

"We've had some unbelievable 
changes in personnel," Androssi 
said. "Hopefully we'll pull out a 
winning season." 

Despite the obvious difficulty of 
having to deal with missing players, 
there have been other causes for 
UCSD's problems. 

As members ofthe Pacific Coast 
Hockey Association last season, the 
Tritons competed in the Division II 
bracket 

This year, however, the Division 
I and Division D brackets have been 
combined into one. 

As a result UCSD has been forced 
to tangle regularly against such top-
notch Division I foes as Stanford, 
USC, Cal Berkeley and San Jose 
State University. Despite the up-
grade in competition, Androssi 
maintains an optimistic attitude. 

"Our strengths are our tenacity 
and the fact that we never give up," 
Androssi said. "As more guys come 
off injury - and out of the wood-
work - we'll win more games." 

The Tritons will travel to USC 
on Monday, then tangle with Or-
ange Coast College for the second 
time this season on Feb. 5. 

Triton Tennis Smashed on Cross-Town Court 
By M ..... Moorthy 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
arrived at Alcala Park on Sunday 
with five new players on its roster, 
knowing it would face a top-ranked 
Division I squad in the University of 
San Diego Toreros. The outcome 
was inevitable - a 7-0 USD ki lling. 

The battle began with USD talc-
ing two of the three doubles matches 
to capture the first point. Then the 
singles playen took the coon. 

Senior John Cross, competing in 

thenumber-onespot,wasupabreak 
early against Frederick Axsater, who 
is ranked among the top 15 in the 
nation. Despite the early lead, the 
stronger of the two players shone 
through. Axsater took the match, 6-

Young each fell in two sets in the 
number·three through number-six 
spots to round out the scoring. 

4,6-0. -
One bright spot for the over-

matched Tritons was number-two 
player Vern Yarnell. Despite a 4-6, 
6-3, 7-6 (7-3) setback, Yarnell 
played well, opening up break 
chances in the final set. 

Despite · a beating on the 
scoreboard, the season opener 
proved to be a good basis on which 
to test UCSD's mettle for the long 
schedule ahead. 

Rob Gessford, Rob Ho and Jeff 

"As a team, we wanted to work 
on a sense of teamwork, focus on 
individual points and compete well," 
UCSD Head Coach Tom Ditzler 
explained. "I think we accomplished 
those three goals."

UCSD Salvages a Split Up North 
ROAD TRIP: Tritons suffer crippling loss to rival Menlo College, then rebound the next night to top Dominican 
By Aron Miller 
Associate Sports Editor 

When the 1993-94 preseason 
NCAA Division III men's basket-
ball polls came out in October, there 

was an obvi-
ous hole. 
Something 
was missing. 
UCSD was 
nowhere to be 
found among 
the top-25 
teams in the 
nation. 

Comi ng 
off of a disap-
pointing 17-8 
mark during 

the previous year - if 17 wins can 
be deemed disappointing - in which 
the Tritons failed to qualify for the 
NCAA playoffs, the pollsters must 

. . have felt that UCSD was unworthy 
of a top-25 ranking. 

Undaunted, the Tritons vaulted 
toanimpressive 13-3 record to open 
this season, which included wins 
over top Division " foes and an 
unprecedented toppling of Division 
r Northern Arizona University. 

Needless to say, UCSD (14-4) 
caught the voters' attention. The 
latest Division III poll, released last 
week, had San Diego ranked third in 
the west region. 

Over the weekend the newly-
empowered Triton squad took its 
seven-game win streak on the road, 
traveling north to square off against , 
archrival Menlo College, and the 
Oaks (7-9) had upset written all over 
their faces Friday night. 

Menlo halted the Tritons' unde-
feated run, pulling out an 80-78 up-
set victory and bringing the San 
Diego juggernaut back down to 
ea rth. 

"We didn't get enough rotation 
off of our bench, especially when 
we got into foul trouble," UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Marshal e~ ­
plained. 

The Oaks rarely led during the 
enti re contest, with UCSD dominat-
ing much of the play. 

The Tritons shot with pinpoint 
accuracy in the first half, amassing 
an outstanding 59 percent perfor-
mance from the field, nailing six of 
II three-point attempts. 

The Oaks tried to keep pace, but 
found themselves down by eight at 
the half, 46-38. 
~ The second half was nip and tuck 

throughout. Tim Cramer's three-
point bucket with .5:43 left gave 
Menlo its first lead since early in the 
first stanza. 

Sophomore forward Kahlil Allen, 
who has made the most of his recent 
promotion into the staning lineup, 
answered Cramer's bomb to put 
UCSD up, 69·68. 

Cramer was not finished,though. 
Fifteen seconds later he struck from 
three-point land once agaIn, giving 
the Oaks a 71 -69 advantage. 

The Tritons clung desperately to 
a 78-77 lead with 37 seconds re-
maining, but Cramer's perimeter 
sideshow reached its a~x, and this 
ti me it spelled doom for San Diego.

His fifth three pointer of the contest 
gave Menlo the lead for good. 

"[Menlo) has had a lot of guys 
outbecauseofinjury," Marshall said. 
"They played really well, and it's 
always tough playing against a big 
rival like Menlo at their place." 

Senior guard Erik Johnson paced 
San Diego with 25 points, canning 
six of 10 from the three-point stripe. 

"[Menlo) played a zone most of 
the game and when teams play zones 
against us, [Johnson's) going to get 
his shots," Marshall said. 

Allen turned in yet another strong 
performance, scoring 21 points on 
seven of eight shooting. 

"lAllen) has responded big time 
since he's been start ing," Marshall 
said. "He's stepped in and has really 
played welL" 

Cramer led Menlo with 23 points, 
scoring II ofthemduringthePoets' 
final run. 

On Saturday night, the Tritons 
played their second game ofthe road 
trip, tangling with Division III door-
mat Dominican College (2-15). 

Despite its pathetic record, D0-
minican gave UCSD a run for its 
money in the first half. In front of an 
unusually large crowd of more than 
500, the home squad kicked and 
scratched its way to a 36-all tie at the 
intermission.

good overall performance." 

Junior forward Tarni Oviatt 
chipped in with another fine outing 
fortheTritons,comingotTthebench 
to record 10 points and 10 rebounds. 

"[Oviatt] did a great job on the 
boards," Malone said. 

Oviatt's totals, along with 18 
points and 14 rebounds from Bea-
ver, spelled UCSD domination in 
the paint. UCSD out-rebounded the 
Poets, 58-44. 

The Tritons also made a living 
at the free throw stripe, burying 27 
of 3.5 free throws, including a per-
fect eight for eight from freshman 
Kelly McGlothlin. 

UCSD cruised down the stretch 
in the second half, sitting on a solid 
20-point advantage. 

Just when Triton fans thought it 
couldn't get any better, sophomore 
forward Valerie Ryan pulled up from 
deep outside the arch and nailed a 
three-pointer in the face of Whittier 
defender Ali Izumita. The shot 
barely beat the second-half buzzer 
and brought the crowd to its feet. 

"Whittier is playing well right 
now," Malone said, "but they caught 
us on a night when we were hot. 
Everybody contributed tonight." 

The victory was the Tritons' sec-
ond in as many days. 

On Friday night, UCSD traveled 
to Chapman University to face the 
routinely underachieving Panthers. 

The first half remained relatively 
close, with the Tritons h<>lding onto 
a measly 33-29 lead at the intermis-
sion. 

The second half was even more 
hard fought, but when all was said 
and done, UCSD came back home 
with a 72-65 victory. 

Freshman point guard Cindy 
Yamasaki led the Tritons with 17 
points on four of seven shooting 
from three-point land. 

The Tritons shot a hefty 45 per-
cent for the game, while Chapman 
could only muster a weak 38 eer-
cent showing. 

Michelle Henricks tallied 15 
points for UCSD. Beaver and Sarah 
Schneider scored 10 points apiece. 

"We are now playing the teams 
[which are) at our level of competi-
tion," Malone said. "We are 
benefitting from the experience of 
the tough schedule." 

The Tritons look to pull their 
record even at 9-9 when they battle 
Pomona-Pitzer at home on Spirit 
Night, Saturday, Ian. 29.

20 SPORTS 

MIKE 

HlTIlfEl 
One More 
Super Bore 

Make no mistake about it, I 
loves me football. I'm talking 
about the NFL and professional 
sports' best full season. 

Sure, the NBA has more 
swoop, but its regular season 
doesn't matter. 

College hoops is pretty rah-
rah, but the flow is bogged 
down by the obligatory three 
time-outs in the last minute. 

Baseball has always worked 
best as tradition and myth, 
more fun to read in the box 
scores unless you can catch a 
day game at Wrigley. 

Hockey, boxing and auto 
racing have their place and 
their die-hard fans, but give me 
that pigskin projectiles. 

The NFL is the only sport I 
can follow day in and day out 
for a whole season, except for 
full-contact figure skating, of 
course. The playoffs are more 
fun if you sit through all 16 
weeks of the regular season, 
especially Chris Berman's 
lively Sunday wrap-up show 
on ESPN. I'm even a member 
of that sick cult that listens to 
XTRA 690 sports talk radio. 
Every weekday I hear the no-
lifers spilllheir guts to Jim 
Rome and tolerate the lost 
perspectives of the serious one, 
Lee "Hacksaw" Hamliton. 

Yes, the regular season is as 
essential to the fun as the 
playoffs and Super Bowl are. 
For yesterday's conference 
finals, the perennials showed 
up again - Dallas, the 4gers, 
the Bills. Also, the upstart 
Kansas City Chiefs led by that 
transplanted legend, Joe 
Montana. 

The old cliche holds that the 
teams that can run, win. They 
certainly did yesterday. In 
Buffalo, the New Reign of Joe 
was overthrown when the 
injury-prone deity was knocked 
out of the game in the third 
quarter. 

From that point on, Bills' 
running back Thurman Thomas 
took over. A few darts up the 
middle here, a sweep and 
cutback there allowed Thomas 
to use up most of the clock and 
187 yards. This, combined 
with his three touchdowns, 
wore down the Chiefs, 30-13. 

Later in Dallas, it seemed like 
life imitated art. In the novel 
North Daluu Forty, the star half-
back takes the needle to heal an 
injury before a big game. Maybe

Triton Men ' Tally 
Two-Point Victory 
TUNE UP: UCSD battles Industry Hills Swim Club, 
looks ahead to Pacific Collegiate Swim Championships 
By D.nsw ..... y 
Staff Writer 

Crunch time is rapidly approach-
ing for the UCSD swim team. The 
Pacific Collegiate Swim 
Championships are less 
than a month away, mak-
ing the last few competi-
tions of the season crucial. 

On Saturday, the Indus-
try Hi lis Swim Club arrived 
at Canyon view tochalJenge 
the Tritons. 

When the tide ebbed, 
the UCSD men logged a 
victory, 54-S2, thanb to a 
number of strong indi-
vidual performances. 

The Triton women were 
not as fortunate, succumbing to a 

strong Industry Hills squad, 93-22. 
"It's hard to evaluate where we 

are right now," UCSD Head Coach 
Doug Boyd said. "We've just started 

tapering some of the 
swimmers. Some swam 
well and some swam not 
so well. We still have 
another meet before con-
ference." 

As always, Senior 
Travis Miller provided 
much of the firepower for 
UCSD. He conquered the 
field in the tOO-meter 
backstroke with a blister-
ing S2.6 pace. He then 
won two more events -
the 200-meter freestyle
