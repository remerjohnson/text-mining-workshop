Leaked Tapes Stir Regent Uproar 
CONFERENCE: Two 
UC Regents ask for UC 
President's resignation 
By C&ncIIce MeF ..... 

At the March 2 conference, 
Peltason spoke about implement-
ing executive retirement bonuses 
and expressed his anger with State 
Assembly Democrats who voted 
against confirming Lester Lee to 
the Board of Regents. Lee, who 
was an acting regent for most of 
the last year, had angered Demo-
crats by voting with the president 
to raise student fees yet again.

Staff Writer 
The Examiner reported that 

Peltason told his colleagues he 
wanted to give "retirement bonuses 
to nine top executives, but worried 
about an 'explosive' reaction when 
the public learns about the plan." 

Peltason added, "There is genu-
ineconcern about the need to keep 
executive pay down, while trying 
to attract and retain the very best 
people to do difficult jobs." 

The possible illegal leaking of 
a videotaped conference between 
University of California President 
Jack Peltason and the nine UC 
chancellors ha!.created an uproar 
in the Office of the President and 
resulted in at least two regents 
calling for his resignation. 

The meeting, held between 
Peltason, three vice presidents and 
the chancellors, was allegedly re-

Members 
BOARD: A.S. calls for removal 
of Warren Senior Aaron 
Goodman from Advisory Board 
By Alexander Th ...... 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Students has recently 
called for the removal of University Cen-
ters Advisory Board (UCAB) Chair Aaron 
Goodman. 

Greg Hearn, A.S. representative to 
UCAB, wrote a letter yesterday claiming that 
the negligence of Goodman's duties as chair 
are grounds for his removal. Goodman called 
the charges "ludicrous" and "totally unwar-
ranted." 

Hearn wrote that during his tenure as 
chair, Goodman has failed to act as a "key 
liaison" for the University Centers or to 
inform new members of the board's func-
tion. The letter further alleged that 
Goodman had not informed representa-
tives of their responsibilities, had missed 
important mandatory meetings and had 
not worked closely with the vice chair o.f~ 
the UCAB. 

In the letter, Hearn also claimed that 
Ooodman made threats to revoke A.S. 
and Graduate Student Association space 
outside of the UCAB meetings. "Mr. 
Goodman hal made several threats out-
side of the UCAB meetings regardin. the 
A.S. and the GSA losing their space," the 
letter read. . 

"I think a lot of the points that have been 
made are in error and have been taken out of 
context. 1bese chlraes are ... making moun-
tainl out of molehills," Goodman said. 
Goodman added thai he would refute the 
A.S. 's allc,ations at the UCAB meeting next 
Priday. 

Ore, Snee, the Alumnj Association's 
representative to the UCAB, was cautious 
about how the board should handle the 
char.es. 

"[Goodman) should be able to respond to 
[the A.S.) and OW' constituents should see 
both [letters) and review, and make our deci-
sion from there. " Snee said.

final score of 16.51 was the 
result of 5,019 citations . 

Caltech came in second place 
with a score of 13.05, and the 
Max Planck Institute of Psy-

score of 10.30, taking third 
place. Six of the top-12 institu-
tions named in the study are 
located in California. 

Salk Institute President Brian 
E. Henderson said that he was 
very pleased with the honor. 

"For some time we've been 
convinced that the Salk Institute!s 
at the top of the neuroscience 
field." Henderson said. 

"It's gratifying to receive 
confirmation from an objective 
and well-respected outside or-
ganization like the Institute for 
Scientific Information that our 
observation was correct," 
Henderson added. 

"We are extremely proud of the 
Salk's neuroscience team, 

that it should be 
made clear that the rating we got 
was a result of the work of 12 
di fferent labs at the Salk Institute. 
Our program has a broad base; it's 
not just one person," Heinemann 
said. 

"I think that the Salk Institute is 
a very good place, maybe the best 
in the country, for practicing pure 
science," he added. 

lSI spokesman David 
Pendlebury recognized the impact 
of the honor. 

"While it is certainly not the 
largest research institution 
around, the Salk Institute more 
than makes up for its smaller 
size by producing papers that. 
pound for pound, have been 
carrying the most powerful 
punch in both molecular biol-
ogy, genetics and in the neuro-
sciences," Pendlebury said. 

The Salk Institute recently gar-
nered another honor, after being 
named the highest-impact institu-
tion in molecular biology and ge-
netics in 1993 by lSI.

cus on the quality of the UC sys-

Even Connerly supports the 
president despite Peltason' s state-

the administrative leave [issue], 
not in spite of Peltason, but be-

were on han~t the forum. Voo 
spoke about the importance of 
uniting campus-wide committees. 
recruiting prospective students and 
the creating of a system of ac-
countability for the representatives 
to student advisory boards. 

Falk addressed the need for a 
cross-cultural center and an in-
crease in the advocacy of students' 
rights to the regents. She also em-
phasized the need to attract stu-
dents of color. calling their low 
representation at UCSD a "crisis." 

Candidates for vice president 
of finance Jennie Craig and Silvia 
Sfiligoi both agreed on the need 
forfinaneial investment in student 
organizations. Craig, running on 
the Students First! slate, suggested 
that an income manager be em-
ployed to increase revenue. That 
money, she said, should be in-
vested in student organizations, 

Sfiligoi, a member of the Stu-

gested that outside organizations

CO_ENTARY: We should do everything in our power to restore democracy in Hiati 

IIJRobLe ...... 
Steff Writer 

To think about Hliti is 10 think 
about tragedy, the tragedy of a once-
proud nation falling into despair. 
Haiti's initially proud history begins 
in the late 18th cenIury when, under 
the leadership of Toussaint I' Over· 
ture, sllves rose up Igainst their 
Napoleonic masters in 1791 and in 
1804 declared national IOvercignty. 
Haiti would become the second inde-
pendent nation in the Western Hemi-
sphere and the world'. first modem 
ind[ependeIlt black nation. Haiti's fu-
ture looked bright as iliooked to fol-
low in the footsteps of its wealthy 
neighbor to the north.

There is also the matter of refu-
gees. At last count, some 60,000 10 
70,000 people have fled the island in 
rickety, unseaworthy boats headed for 
U.S. shores. Some 30,000 of these 
people ha.·t been granted asylum, 
while the rest have been forcibly trans-
ported back. This rejection of refu-
gees is a moral outrage. It is reminis-
cent of when the United Stales turned 
beck the ship St. Louis in.the 193Os, 
sending Jewish refugees blck 10 face 
Hitler's gas chambers. 

Moral qucslions aside, given the 
current political climate in the United 
Stales, accepting thousands of poor, 
uneducated and often HIV-positive 
refugees is au unlikely alternative. The

after a reasonable amount of time it 
must be given an ultimatum: either

tarily if ncccssary. If U.N. demands 
are not met, a multi-national force, 
acting underthe authorilyoflhe United 
Nations and the Organization of 
American States (OAS), should land 
in Haiti, disann and disband the mili-
tary, and reestablish civilian rule un-

Obviously, such a course is not 
without risk. As intervention in S0-
malia has illustrated, violeoce can

DIVERSITY:

the center. 

The spirit of the proposal is the 
promotion ofmutualleaming.ln the 
context of such comments by those 
who know little but say much, and 
who are extremely sensitive to the 
issues of inclusion, it isoften difficuh 
to hash out the differences in a con-
structive manner. Despite the 
coalition's repeated attempts to open 
this discussion to the campus com-
munity, many continue to believe 
thatthecross-cultural centerpropasal 
is exclusionary. 

Another suggestion from 0ppos-
ing groups is that the administration 
funnel<imoneyloalready-existingpro-
grams like Student Outreach and Re-
auitment and Oasis, rather than cre-
ate an entirely new space for the same 
purposes. There is an irony here. The 
strongest proponents of the Cross-
Cultural Center are the people who 
are working for these programs. If the 
experts on outreach, recruitment and 
retention are strongly endorsing such 
a center, shouldn't that tell us that the 
existing programs are already being 
cheated out of funding and support 
from the administration? The center 
proposal seeks tocoordinate with these 
existing programs, expanding them

FAMILIES IN PERIL 
Old Globe 

productions of 
'Dirt' and '} ar 
the Floor' give 

critical 
renditions of 
family life 

By JOHN GODFREY 
STAFF WRITER 

The two shows currently running at the Old Globe Theatre bear a remark-
able resemblance to one an-
other- a family resemblance, 
if you will-and are inextrica-
bly linked in structure and 
theme, 

In both "Dirt" and "Jar the 
Floor" we are introduced to 
families in disrepair, families 
in which selfishness and self-
loathing preempt communica-
tion, anger preempts kindness 
and fear preempts love. In both 
plays a stranger enters into the 
family strife and catalyzes repa-
rations, proving blood to be 
quite thick and altogether bind-
ing. 

And in both of these produc-
tions, the Old Globe has cre-
ated realist drama that succeeds 
as engaging entertainment but 
falls just short of something 
transcendent and poetic. Both are trying to 
get there; neither does. 

Cheryl L. West's "Jar the Floor" gathers 
four generations of black American women 
together to celebrate MaDear's(lrma P. Hall) 
90th birthday. Each woman has her own 
compelling story to tell, and, interestingly, 
the absence of men in their lives provides 
much of the tension in the work. 

Great grandmother MaDear is becoming 
senile and yearns to go back home to Missis-
sippi to be with her recently deceased hus-
band, not fully grasping the idea that he is' 
dead. Grandmother Lola (Crystal Laws 
Green) never had a steady man in her life, but 

she is constantly in contact with an offstage 
stable of admirers. Mother MayDee (Brenda 
Pressley) is on the academic fast track and 
claims to have no time for a man in her life. 
And daughter Vennie (Susan Payne) arrives 
at the party with her girlfriend in tow, all but 
announcing that she is a lesbian and is not 
interested in dealing with men, period. 

Although the plan is to celebrate MaDear's 
birthday, the festivities are pul OQ hold in 
favor of that speciaJ brand of emotional 
assault-and-battery that characterizes many 
families. Each of the four women seems to 
have all of the solutions for the "man prob-

lems" of the other women in the 
play, though none has'spent much 
time reflecting upon her own pa-
thology and behavior patterns. 

Unfortunately for the audience, 
West's powerfully-acted and al-
ways engagins scenes do not build 
upon one another. Instead, they 
pile up in a rather haphazard fash-
ion. Arguments that happen late in 
Act II could have taken place early 
in Act I without harming the flow 
of the piece, and vice versa. 

Director Tazewell lbompson 
keeps the jokes and the action com-
ing at a swift pace, but his earnest 
direction cannot overcome the most 
serious structural fault in the text: 
it is not until the very end of the 
play that you feel any sense of 
culmination in the drama, and by 
that time it is too late. 

West's ending brings the four 
women together for a final gesture 
of solidarity - they stomp, "jar-
ring the floor" together - but this 
potentially exciting denouement is 
too rushed and too fon:ed. The fi-
nal scene is cleuly intended to 
create a moment of poetic res0-
nance, but it smacb oftelevisioo-
advertising neatness, leaving audi-
ence members in the Cassius Carter 
rollina their eyes rather tbm wip-
ing tears away. 

With "Dirt, " playwright Bruce 
Gooch is also trying to forge a 
magical finale out of a naturalist-
realist aesthetic. Like West, Gooch

ters, but he, too, stumbles in trying 
to leap toward a poetic conclu-
sion. 

It's a shame that the script isn't 
better, because the Globe has all 
of the other elements in place for 
this West Coast Premiere. Scenic 
designer Ralph Funfcello and cos-
tume designer Deborah M. Dryden 
have invented richly detailed de-
signs which belp give the produc-
tion an authentic middle-Arneri-
can ambieoc:e. Director Andrew J. 
Traister also seems right for this 
play, pulling wonderful . perfor-
mances out of the cast and staging 
each scene with an attention to-
ward subtlety and emotional clar-
ity. 

"Dirt" centers on the troubled 
relationship between the recently-
widowed SoMY Hardman (James 
Whitmore) and his son Zac (John 
Dennis Johnston). Sonny, a 
farmer, is becoming senile and 
increasingly in need of supervi-
sion as the play opens. Zac arrives 
at the family farm to check up on 
his father and, upon seeing his 
father's erratic behavior. decides 
to stick around to help plant the 
spring crop. 

Between tractor turns across 
the back forty. lac also tries to 
become the good son and help his 
father deal with the lOIS of his 
wife. Both men are stubborn. bow-
ever. and all attempts at commu-
nication and reconciliation are 
thwarted until Eleanor (Annette 
Heide) enters the fray. 

Her presence throws the two 
men off guard. Sonny is reminded 
of his wife, and, in several edgy 
scenes, SoMY talks to ( and kisses) 

Thunday, "areh 31,1994 

Eleanor as if she were his late 
spouse. Zac' s fondneas for Eleanor 
helps him find the compaasion he 
neCd's to instigate a reconciliation 
with his father. 

Gooch,like West, wants to cre-
ate a searing image in his finale but 
his scattered dramaturgy betrays 
him. He plants the seeds of trans-
formation in his two central char-
acters, but "Dirt" does not illus-
trate enough of the subtle transi-
tions in their relationship to har-
vest the intended resonance of their 

~nciliation. 
The play may not be in great 

shape. but Whitmore and Johnston 
are riveting as the embattled father 
and son. These two actors com-
pletely capture the hard-edged, 
stark demeanor called for in the 
play. In watching them, one not 
only gets the sense that both men 
know their way around a backhoe 
and a tiller, but also that they have 
wrung every last drop of dramatic 
moisture from this arid script. 

Unfortunately for Heide. 
Eleanor is relinquished to the role 
of facilitator. She furthers the rela-
tionship between father and son. 
but is left to watch from the wings 
as this deliberately-paced drama 

. gains momentum late in Act 2. Her 
virtual disappearance in the last 
five minutes of the play is a further 
sign of the play's weakness. and 
Heide seemed conscious of this. 
trying too hard to listen. to look 
scared, to show how concerned she 
was when the action didn't involve 
ber in the alightest.

CONCERTS 

Blind Melon 
Band works Price 
Center Ballroom 

crowd into a frenzy 
By D .. McDowell 
Senior Staff Writer 

"If the barricade breaks and one of you gets hurt, 
please don't sue me because I'm having a bad year," 
Blind Melon lead singer Shannon HOOD told the 
audience as stage bands desperately attempted to fix 
the collapsing barricade. One young woman climbed 
on stage amidst the confusion, and, when 8D attempt 
was made to remove her, pulled Hoon offstage. All 
before the first song concluded. 

Despite a somewhat rough start, Blind Melon 
seized the moment with its latest single "Tones of 
Home," bringing the sold-out crowd in the Price 
Center Ballroom Monday night into a frenzy. Hoon 
again captivated the audience by appearing with an 
acoustic guitar and a harmonica, playing them simul-
taneousl y during a rendition of "Working Class Hero." 
Joined by Roger Stevens and Chti.stopher Thom on 
guitar and mandolin, the band played a moving 
"Change" and "I Wonder," both off its self-titled 
debut. 

Blind Melop brought the audience together and 
created an in~mate environment in the otherwise 
sterile Price Center Ballroom. During "No Rain," the 
hit single which propelled the 'band to its current 
success, Hoon held his microphone over the crowd 
for the first verse. The encore had HOOD singing 
multiplication tables: "three, six, nine .. . 27." When 
one audience member was given a chance to do the

same, she stopped after reaching nine. "You've gone 
to too many Ugly Kid Joe concerts," he joked. "We 
used to watch 'School House Rock,' that 's how we 
all kept our dealers from ripping us off." 

After. the hour-and-a-half show, HOOD finally bid 
farewell to the receptive crowd with "Merry Christ-
mas and a happy New Year!" 

Dig and Alice Donut opened for Blind Melon. 
Dig 's rhythmic guitars rocked through on its MTV 
Buzz Bin hit "Believe," Pink Floyd's "Fearless" and 
the set-ending "Mother Ship." 

The highlight of Alice Donut's set included a 
guest appearance by Dig vocalist/guitarist Scott 
Hackworth during an interpretation of the Beatles' 
"Helterskelter. "

Triton Tennis Slugs UCSC, 6-3 
By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writar 

The UCSD women's tennis team 
clashed with fellow Division III op-
ponent UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday 
at the spanking-new Spanos tennis 
courts in an epic, five-hour affair. 
When the dust cleared, the Tritons 
(7-2) walked away with a hard-
fought 6-3 victory. 

The match marked the return of 
Kim Takemoto, playing in her first 
match since suffering a wrist injury 
in December. Although Takemoto 
lost a marathon match to Rhea Moss 

6-3, 3-6, 6-1 at the number-six spot, 
Head Coach Liz laPlante is ecstatic 
to have the sophomore back. 

The Tritons excelled in singles 
play. Top-seed Diane Chandler 
outlasted Kelli Herzog 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 
and Michele Malephansakul, Hilary 
Somers, Heather Williams and 
Michelle Wilbur all won. 

UCSD looked a little less pol-
ished in doubles, losing two of the 
three matches. 

On the bright side, the top-seeded 
duo of Miki Kurokawa and Somers 
dominated Herzog-Chii (7-6, 6-2).

Falls to 
LMU 
IWMPlNI: Tritons 
inconsistent in straight-
set loss to visiting Lions 
.,.,.. KnIft 
AuocI.te ~ Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyb.1I 
team has bad • roup year 10 say the 
least, but 10 add inlult 10 injury, the 

Tritons h.ve 
been in • 
slump over the 
past few 
m.tches. It·s 
hard to believe 
that a team 
with a record 
of 2-18 can 
have a slump, 
but to anyone 
who has wit-
nessed the 
breakdown of 

UCSD's continuity and emotion. it 
is obvious. 

Against Loyola Marymount last 
night, the Tritons once again 
struggled painfully through a 
straight-set defeat at the hands of 
the Lions. 15·1. 15-6, 15-6. 

Game one saw Loyola jump out 
to a 9-3 advantage before UCSD 
responded with a small run to close 
the gap 10 9-1. The Lions reacted by 
roaring past the Trilons and scoring 
the final six points of the game. 

In game two, Loyola dominated 
the action throughout, not allowing 
UCSD any glimmer of hope on its 
way to a two-games-to-none lead. 

The final stanza unfolded in much 
the same fashion as the Lions ag.in 
put away the lackluster Tritons by a 
score of 15-6. 

"We are in a rut ript now," Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik said. "We 
aren'tcompetinguwellaswewere, 
and our confidence is suffering." 

Part ofUCSD's problem has been 
its lack of consistency and colle-
siveneu in the fIlce of its Division I 
foes_ 

"We haven't been able to estab-
lish a lineup and it's costing us," 
Danncvik said. _

Cycling 

For members 
of the UCSD cy-
c1in,team, spring 
break cert.inly 
didn't qualify u 

a time to relax and unwind. The 
cyclers were busy with. competi-
tion the weekend before finals at 
San Diego State .nd two races over 
the break in Pow.y and Irvine. The 
time and effort paid off, however, 
as they advanced 10 second place in 
the conference rankings behind Cal 
Poly San Luis

A daunting 
9.000 feet of 
climbing over 
the 41-mile

Rugby 

The UCSD 
rugby team looked 
more like a 
M.A.S.H. unit af-
ter sustaining a 

rash of injuries over the course of 
the season. 

Injuries to a 
number of the 
veteran pl. yen 
have hampered 
the young Triton 
squad on its 
quest to earn a 
playoff berth . 
The situation 
didn't get any 
easier over

UCSD faced

nal two games of 
league play.

ingof UCSD. 

With the casualties mounting 
daily. San Diego struggled to field 
enough players for its final match 
against UC Irvine. 

Bruised and b.ttered. the Tri-
tons pulled to· 
gether and put 
in a courageous 
effort, but were 
unable to over· 
come the vet· 
eran squad from 
Irvine and 
dropped the 
contest, 35-3, 
scoring only on 
a penalty kick 
by Devon Shea. 

Already 
shorthanded. the 
Tritons lost sev· 

UCSD rulb, couldn't run over 
USD or UCI over the bre.k. 

With the 
two losses over 
the break. the 
Tritons fin-
ished with a 3·

league play. 

UCSD reo

its impressive run for a 
league title, improving 

its record to • perfect 6.() with vic-
tories over Redl.nds and Whittier

The Poets found themselves 
writing their own epitaphs midway 
through Sund.y·s contest. UCSD 
held. commanding 6·1 lead at half· 
time and cruised to an 11-5 victory. 

N.ncy Vesper led the San Di·

repeatedly slicing between defend· 
ersand firing shots put the helpless 
Whilticr netminder.

were greeted rather rudely. 

The Tritons pounded the Ti· 
gers into a pulp, winning the game 
with a dominating 18-2 tally. 

UCSD jumped 10 a 10-0 lead in 
the first h.lf, scoring two quick 
goals in the first minute of action. 

The Tigers were left wonder· 
ing what truck had hit them as 
UCSD bombarded them offen· 
sively and snuffed almost every 
Redlands rush upfield. 

Shannon Northrup led UCSD's 
offensive onslaught with five goals 
on the afternoon. 

Vesper once again played a 
solid game, canning four goals, 
while team captain Lac Nguyen 
did her sh.re of the work by con· 
tributing three. 

Varsity "B" memben Joshua 
Cooper and Feldman used their 
knowledge of the wind conditions

finishes. 

The junior varsity squad of 
Marianne Hawkins and Jason Pettit

TOURNAMENT: UCSD captures fifth place behind tough Div I & II competition Splits 
By TecId Ladd 

If I hear another word about 
this Jimmy Jones Johnson Jerry 
affair I will no longer be held 
responsible for my actions. 

I mean, what exactly is 
going on here? With .11 these J 
names being spit out .t me 
with less accumcy th.n a wad 
of tobacco juice at spring 
training, how in the hell am I 
supposed to get this whole 
sordid story straight?

Whether it's by playing in inflat· .I. W IIW 

OK, so Jerry Jimmy Jones, 
outraged because Johnson Jerry 
burned the toast after a wild 
evening of intoxication at 
Disney World, decides to invite 

_ _ ,f another good 01' boy from 
down-home Arkansas, Bill 
Clinton, to take over the new 
ownership of the Dallas 
Cowboys because of his 
unmatched savvy in the 
savings and loan business. 

No, wait a minute, that's not 
it. Jones Johnson, in an 
egocentric fit of ownership 
rage, toasts Jimmy Jerry 's 
reporter girlfriend, Jane, at a 
cocktail party in Orlando,FL 
He is, however, fired because 
he can't follow through with 
the two-point conversion for 
the score. 

No, no, this is it. It's the old 
Switzeroo gambit. Jimmy 
Jones Jerry, feeling he did not 
receive enough credit for the 
Cowboys ' recent success 
against Bud Light in Bud Bowl 
MXCI, decided to fire Johnson 
and Johnson and replace him 
with a less teary-eyed, former 
Oklahoma-cornhusking coach, 
Barry "I'm paid to be open to 
your options" Switzer, to 
implement a soaped-up version 
of the wishbone. 

Actually, I wouldn't even 
. ... be able to figure out what in 

God's name is going on with 
this whole J.J.-U. thing with a 
damn road map in front of me. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I 
enjoy loathing the self-denoted 
America's Team u much u 
any red·blooded American 
should, and this unrom.ntic 
brakup is just another 
assurance to me that the 
Cowboys will most likely be 
revisiting the happy-go-lucky 
days of 1989, when America's 
Sweethearts were nursing a 
healthy 1-15 record. 

Oh, how I yearn for the 
good old days of yesteryear.

The Triton

on Monday,

UCSD faltered behind such Di-
vision I and II powerhouses as UC 
Davis and Cal State Long Beach, 
but it was able to dominate the rest 
of the field, finishing well ahead of 
all Division III foes. 

"It was a difficult tourney for 
our guys," said Head Coach Mike 
Wydra. "They were geared up to 
play 36 holes but could only play 
27." 

The tournament had to be cut 
short because of foggy conditions. 
The best scores for each squad, split 
on the front and back nine, were 
tallied toward the final point totals. 

"The experienced players knew 
what to do out there," Wydra said. 

No one has more experience than 
senior Dale Abraham, who led the 
way for the Tritons with a solid 
round of 74. 

Freshman Mike Hartford, the let-

"We're.1I hoping that [Shafer] 
will be back soon," said Wydra. "If 
not ... sticka fork in us, we're done. " 

In the meantime, the UCSD 
squad hu been feverishly training 
for a return to Nationals by learning 
to golf left· handed. 

"The new instructional tapes 
we're usingrealJy help," Wydra said. 
"Swinging left·handed improves 
one's right-handed follow·through." 

With a big tournament coming 
up at Irvine on April 4-5, the Triton 
golfers need to do well to stay on the 
road to a second-consecutive Divi· 
sion III Championship. 

"We'll know soon who .re the 
players and who are the pretend· 
ers," said Wydra.

The UCSD women's softball

UCSD Can't 
Undermine 
Lords' Gold 
SILVER STANDARD: 
Flowers and Miller pace 
Triton men to third-
straight runner-up trophy 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Kenyon College has given Divi-
sion III men 's swimming head 
coaches good reason to desecrate 
just about every commandment 
known to man. After the Lords re-
corded their 15th-straight NCAA 
Men 's Swimming and Diving cham-
pionship at Williams College March 
17-19, it is no longer a sacrilege to 
take the Lords ' name in vain. 

Triton Head Coach Doug Boyd 
knew that the UCSD contingent was 
the only squad capable of dethron-
ing the Lords ' stranglehold on the 
title, and he played his cards with a 
veteran pOker player's intensity. 

Strategically using his two aces, 
seniors Travis Miller and John Flow-
ers, to rack up heavy points in the 
relays, the Tritons were bloody 
thorns in the Lords ' crown. 

UCSD consummated the '94 
meet in gold when Flowers, Miller, 
Kaley Parkinson and Judd Glasser 
topped Kenyon in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay in a pool record 
1:21.99. 

Miller, who grabbed his second 
straight Swimmer-of-the-Year hon-
ors, annihilated the field in the 200 
1M, successfully defending his '93 
National record title (1 :50.13) in a 
time of 1 :50.66. 

Flowers scorched his way to sec-
ond in the 50 free (20.62), and Adam 
Burgasser (fourth, 418.70) and Josh 
Curtiss (10th, 353.45) contributed 
vital points in the one-meter diving 
to keep UCSD in the hunt. 

Unfortunately, Kenyon revenged 
its earlier relay loss in spades with a 
3:23.36 gold-medal standard in the 
400 medley relay. UCSD's Andy 
Hollywood, Chris Jagard, Miller and 
Flowers nabbed the silver (3:24.07), 
but UCSDended up trailing Kenyon 
by 54.5 points after the first day. 

"We never expected to lose that 
race," Boyd said. "We had been 
3:22 with the same relay before. I 
guess it wasn't in the cards for us." 

The Tritons' fate wu sealed early 
on the second day when their 200 
medley relay squad was disquali-
fied in the mornings' prelims for 
leaving the blocks too early . Kenyon 
dominated the evening's final,cruis-
ing to a first-place 1 :32.0 clockina. 

"The medley relay was damag-
ing," Boyd said. "You can' t lose 40 
points in a meet like this. We knew 
we couldn't control our own destiny 
and [the playen] ltarted swimming 
for fun. It is pretty tense to do wbat 
we were trying to do thil year." 

F~hman Ed Ruth, despite bat-
tling a raging case of strep throat, 
corralled a bronze in the 400 1M 
(4:07.80) and senior Pete Shim 
turned in a 13th-pl8Ce 4:11.38.

NCAA REBIRTH: Youngsters pace Triton women to fourth-place tally 
at Division III Swimming Nationals at Williams College 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

The Division III women's swimming world 
wasn't expecting much from UCSD this year. After 
all, the Tritons had lost a pool full of All-Americans 
to graduation, including former individual titlists

UCSD was left standing on tbe blocks mucb of 

the first day of competition, advancing no one into 
either the consolation (the ninth through 16th quali-
fiers) or championship finals (top eight) of the SO-
yard freestyle and 200 1M. Freshman Heather 
McPhenon wu 16th in the 500 free (5:13.91) and

consecutive national runners-up 
could lut with only one senior

Many of Boyd's doubts were 

squashed by the Tritons' perfor-

ing Championships held at Wil-
liams College on March 10-12, 
when UCSD valiantly battled to 
a fourth-place finish.

"It's beat to act the loDe with

CLEAN ENTRY: Triton 
women dominate three-
meter boards at Nationals 

Although the women's diving 
points are added to the swimming 
teams's score, the Triton divers were 
on a plane of their own at this year's 
NCAA Championships. 

UCSD blew away the field in 
both the one-meter and three-meter 
events held March 10th and 12th. 

Senior Julie Goldstein stole the 
show, capturing an elusive double 
championship with 421.15 points in 
the one-meter and a national record-
breaking 464.90 tally in the three-
meter which eclipsed Melissa 
Moody 's 1991 mark of 462.70. 

"[Goldstein] was dead last at 
Nationals her first time," Head 
Coach Mike Fitchett said. "She just 
dominated everyone this time. For 
her, it is a fairy tale come true." 

The legend continued with se-
nior Jill Jackson (463.15) and sopho-
more Sheri Takeuchi (443.0) gar-
nering sec:ond- and third-place hon-
ors, respectively on the three-meter. 
Freshman Kristi Young tallied a

Jackson struggled for sixth on

Takeuchi rallied for ninth (348.75) 
and Young nailed 14th (330.75). 

"1bere is a lot of politics in-

voted the Diving Coach of the Year 
for the second consecutive time. 
"The last thing you want is for the

Chancellor Atkinson to Resign 
ANNOUNCEMENT: Beloved 
administrator will make good 
on threat to leave post in June 
By .......... 
Completely Exonereted 

UCSD Ctancellor Richard Atkinson will 
announce today that he intends to step down 
from his post at the end of the academic 
year, according to a source close to the 
chancellor. 

While the timing of the announcement 
caulht many of Atkinson's colleaaucs by 
surprise, the chancellor's actions are not 
completely unanticipated. Last October, 
during a speech to the Academic Senate, 
Atkinaon threatened to resign if the U niver-
sity of California did not revise its pol icy of 
compensating campuses for research. 

Atkinson is said to be furious that UC 
President Jack Peltason has not taken any 
action on the compensation policy. 

"Dick is just hopping mad," said an 

unnamed vice chancellor for academic af-
fairs. "He'salways been somethingofa hot-
head. And this wu just the final straw." 

Bcn Hansford, a bartender at the UCSD 
Faculty Cub and an Atkinson confidant, 
said that Atkinson had been agonizing over 
the decision for weeks. 

"Look, the auy loves the campus, he's 
got a great relationship with all the kids 
here, but he's just fed up," Hansford said. 
"Last night, he says to me, 'Bcn, I just can't 
stand it anymore.' And we all know what a 
vile tempcr Dick Atkinson hu. 

"I just hope he remembers to pay his bar 
tab," Hansford added. 

When reached for comment on 
Atkinson's apparent resignation, Peltason 
cackled madly into the phone. 

"He'll come crawling back. They always 
come back," PeltaJon said. 

Atkinson became UCSD's chancellor in 
1979, aften stint u the head of the National 
Science Foundation. Upon arriving on cam-

T-Reg Crashes, 
Erases Enrollment 
FAlWRE: Students may have to take finals over 
after last quarters' grades were destroyed in mishap 
By Nell Poetnlen 
Technophobe 

As a result of a computer malfunction, the UCSD Telephone Student 
Services (TESS) system went out of service on Monday afternoon, 
inadvertently erasing students' enrollment in Spring Quarter classes. 
Grades for Winter Quarter classes may also have been erased in the 
mishap. 

"People should keep in mind that it's important not to panic," said 
Assistant Registrar Randall P. MacMurphy. "Even if we did accidentally 
erase all of our records." 

Records for class enrollment were completely erased, and students 
will have to re-register once the T-reg system is operational. 

In the event that last quarter's grades cannot be retrieved, studen t 
may be required to take their finals over for some classes, according to 
Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Margaret Cessario. 

"Life isn 't always fair, but what can you do?" Cessario sa id. "We have 
to get the grades back somehow. You kids are just out of luck." 

Following a system crash in February, the malfunction is the second 
time this year that T -reg has gone out of service. However, this is the first 
time that student records have been completely erased. 

"Of course, it's a disaster," MacMurphy said. "We're sorry about it, 
but that's the price you pay for superior technology." 

PETE ROCKS! Outraaed UCSD students lined up at the Registrar's Office on Tues-day and Wedncsclay to air their frustrations. 
"Let's bum the damn T-reg computer to the ground," said Warren 

College senior Grell Wrenn, who wu later arrested by campus police .

Fifth Won't Be Named 'Roosevelt' 

In I surprise amouncement. the University of 
CeHfomIa BoII'd of Recenta his retJoacthely rejected 
the renemI~ of Rfth CoUe&e after Eleanor Roosevelt. 

ClaIm~ that they had been misinformed as to her 
...... the board heidi epeelal ~ to reverse 
the decision. The vote was unanimous. 

"We hid no Idee It was I woman that we W8f8 
~ " ReCent ROV Costanza .. Id yesterday. "I 
mean. If I hid known It was Eleanorwe were taIkllC 
about. I nMr would 11M voted the 'd'i I did: he 
added. 

Reaent Peter Afsari 1If'Hd, sayIfC. "I Was sound 
asleep. I wish someone hid given me I nudCe. I can't 
believe this happened." 

Rfth CoIIeee PrOYOSt Jamie Lyon was upset <Mill" the 
AMfSII. "lam really upset, just really ticked off: he said. 

"Illcad EIa10r Roal8Wllt, It hid I &Ood riW to It. " 
The ,.....a. vote effectively sends fifth CoIIeCe

Rfth students were ahoc:ked bv the recenta' vote. 
"I don't reilly undnt8nd -"It the hubbub Is 1M about, 
she was Just I babe." .. Id Rfth Junior Nabliissa. 

~ to Lyon. the coIIe&e will appeal the wta. 
"She was I &r8It woman and she did some really 
Important stuff." he said. 

But NsarI IIId such an appeal would not be 
seriously considered bv the board. "UCSO has always 
had kind of a manly !maCe. tMtIl tho .. It doesn't 11M 
I fooCball team." he said. "Maybe Eleanor would work 
for I campus like Riverside." he added. 

ERRATA 
On the front page of this issue. we mistakenly reported that the A.S. was setting up a "Club Wally 

Lockwood Booth" where students could physically abuse the A.S. Director of Refrigerators. In actuality, 
the A.S. is setting up a booth for a "Wally Lockwood Oub," where students can get frcc Lockwood t-
shirts. Clubbing someone over the head would be illegal. The Disreg'lImJian regrets the error. Kind of.

DICK: 
ContInued from ..... 1 
pus, Atkinson immediately devel-
oped a reputation for his bands-on 
approach to running the university 
and his familiarity with the La 
Jolla area. 

Atkinson could frequently be 
found chatting with students at the 
Hump and was a fixture at the 016 
Caf6every Wcdncaday during "All 
You Can Eat" NiSht. 

"We're rD juIIt lolling a cbanccIIor, 
wc~re kJsing a friend, " said Local Radi-
cal By Rabani. "I remameronc ~ I 
WIL'IlPn8lobavetroublcpayingatfmy 
f=i. So I wm 10 DK:k. and the next 
noning, he banIk me 11\ umnartced 

of money that he 1&1 pasnilly 'bor-
rowrd' from the univasity. 

"This is all off the record. 
right?" Rabani added. 

"Some people think the chanccl-

lor docen't care about students," 
Hansford agreed. "But the people 
wbothinklhlljustdon'tlmow Dick. " 

Atkinaon'sdcparture will leave 
a vacancy in the chancellor's of-
face, which the UC Office of the 
President will try to fill as quickly 
as possible. One possible succes-
sor is UCSD's Vicc Chancellor 
for Student Affairs Joe Watson. 

"I tbink it's too carly to think 
about anytbing like tbat. ~ far u 
I'm concemed, Dick Atkinson is 
the chancellor here, and I'm the 
vice chancellor. I haven't given 
much thought to taking over at 
all," said Watson. as he measured 
Atkinson's office for spacc. 

"Do youthinkthesccurtainsclash 
with the desk?" Watson added. 

At. for Atkinson, the future 
lookS bright. While otber univer-
sitica have reportedly expressed 
an interest in the chaocclJor, it is 
said that Atkinson intends to pur-

An lIVId Joaer, AtkInMn 
enjoyed,... .. col ......... 
sue his first love - screenwriting. 

"Dick's just got the show busi-
ness bug," Hansford said. "When-
ever he visits tbe faculty club, he' s 
always tellins us some far-out idea 
for a script. I always fiJUred it was 
the liquor talking, but apparently 
be's really serious about tbis."

Overthrow the Regents 
The university is milking us lib a bunch of cows. A wise man once 

said that, and he wasn't whistling dixie. Even now, as you sit there reading 
this sentence, the regents - those all-powerful white males with their 
bulging bank accounts and Arturo Fuente cigars - are sitting around 
their marble round table in some secret bunker in Oakland plotting against • 
good, honest, peace-loving, long-haired fJeaky people lib yoo and me. 

ln~, we're being milked lib a bunch of dumb heifers. With each 
fascist fee increase, our udders become more and more swoDen. With 
each abuse of power, our teats get just a wee bit stiffer. 

We say to hell with that. 
The time his come to through off the sbackles of reaenta1 oppression 

and tum the whole damned university inIo one giant student-run 0lHlp. 
The students sbould come together and unite, fOl'llliD& a rulina oouocil 
that will make decisions for the JOOd of all. For the ~. Wortina 
together, the studenIs could lUm Ibis faceless, oppressive lnstitutionof the 
MaD into a glorious commune. All remnants of the old regeDlal'fIIeID 
of oppmsioo would be overturned. No IDOR grades. No IDOR bome-
work. No more boob. Indeed, DO IDOR tadIen' dirty loob. 

The noo-bcIieven will have to be DCUtrIIiad, cI. coune. The IIUdeaII 
who oppose - thole who work in Icape with the siDiIter ... to keep 
the studeats down - should be c:baIed tbrougb the IIDeets with sdcb ad 
stones until they come to see thiap our way. Some wiD have to be lad to 
re-educ:ation camps, still others willilave to be publicly IUCUted Some 
may say this isdrutic. And they're prot.bly ript. Butasaoodlerwile mID 
once said, you can't mike an omeIeaewilboutCDCldaaa few ... It', for 
the greater good, and a few roaco IptJIIs CIa apoilthe wboI! buDch. 

As ·for the regents, their days are numbered. The dcIl·.1bout to go 
down. Soon. the streets will flow with the blood of the infidels. We will 
have to hunt them down lite dogs in the street, spuiDg DO men:y for the 
villainous regenlS and their cadIoIK:opy lackeys. 

And as those wicked MalPies peer from their priIoo cells and see the 
smoldering ruins of their dec:adeut way of life, we will giggle with glee. 
Oh, what a brave new world this will be! 

Overthrow the A.S. 
Democracy is the art of RIIIIIiDg the zoo from the moakey cage. A wise 

man once said that, and he WUD't just full of ps. When me Ioob .. the 
unprincipled backs and future law iCoollIUdenIs who ND amuck in the 
A.S. Council, one realizes just bow nec:aaary itia to IIkcClCbAS. oouocil 
member and have him or her lWDIIWily executed at dawn. 

Not that we're oppoacd to student government. Heavens, DOl We love 
the idea of students seizing control of the UDivenity ad stickina it to the 
administrative Man. But the current crop of officeboldas in the AS. 
sickem us. AI best, they are a bunch of direcIionIesa boobs, driftiag from 
dawn to dusk in a poIl-alcobolic stupor. trying to remember wberc they 
left their car keys. AI. wont, they are IOUllms mariooeacs for the 
administration, dancing OIl their strings whenever Vice Chancellor lor 
Facism Tommy Tucker tells them to jump. • 

AS. President Carla TCSIk IIIIDkes lib a fiead and CUlUllite .saiIor. 
AS. Vice President &temal N"d Endres ia a dupe for the RepubIicu 
Party. AS. Vice Pres J\dminisIgtiw John Bamea ia aD emotional wna

lib a grandmother the next. Wbeo he', not downing IboCs of dIeIp 
Canadian whiskey, Wally Loc:boocI is trying to seD people cheap 
refrigerators. aearly, this must stop. 

The tint thing we do ia line the floors of the A.S. oflicca with 
compression grenades, enough 10 blow everyone, from the migbtieIt 
executive officer to the lowliest senator to kiJI&dom come. Sure, innoc:eDt 
blood may be spilled, but it's all in the name of Revolution. 

With their lacbys' festering bodies lying in the rubble of tbe High 
Price Center, the acIminiatr.aors will know that their gig is up. Their days 
of uncbeckcd tyranDy are over, and they will run like frightened Utt1e 
monkeys as fast as their pudgy Uttle legs will carry them. 

And then - utopial A government run for the students by the students. 
We'll gather each nigbt to link arms and sing Kumbiyah. We'U roat 
marsbmallowsoverlbesmolderingskullsoftboae foolish enough toreaist 
and swap tales about how glorious things are DOW that the Revolution has 
finally come.

editor David Footlick. "After all, 
we haven't been funny in years." 

Representatives for the new 
indicalOrwere less sanguine about 
the budget cut. "It's an outrage. 
We're completely innocent," 
screamed collective member Ely 
Rabani . 

'1'he n.;' would never print pic-
tures like that, especially the ones 
involving the Cub Scout Troup. 
I'm almost sure running those pic-
tures would violate a state law," 
said Rabani, who added that the 
whole incident left him feeling 
"sickened." 

Park insisted tbat this latest 
mishap wu the last straw. "Tune 
and time again, we've given the 
A.S. media free reign," she said. 
"And then, they go and print pho-
tos like these." 

Lee agreed with Park, adding, 
"You can only stretch satire so far. 
r can't believe they mentioned 
body parts." 

Woodard offered to beat the 
offending party senseless with a

Outstanding Tritons the New Rage on the Track 

There I was, sitting on my 
sofa, drinking a cold, frosty one 
and watching the cool hoop 
showdown between Duke and 
Purdue. And there was the Big 
Dog, racing down the court, d0-
ing those monster slams"hat he 
does. Yes, the Big Dog was run-
ning from one end of the floor to 
the other. He never looked back. 

PUMPED: UCSD tracksters are hoping to reach heights of 5,00 ccs in quest for National Championship 

And I think to myself - Out-
standing! 

Yessir, Outstanding is the 
word I'm thinking of. Watching 
an athlete like the Big Dog or MJ 
or Will the Thrill or the Big Hurt 
- each and every one of them, 
Outstanding in his own way. 

And why are they so Out-
standing? What is it that they do 
that makes them shine with 
Outstandingness? Because they 
do cool things. Cool things, man. 

You're still Outstanding, 
though not that Outstanding.

its domination, 
Triton Track 
and Field Head 
Coach Tony 
Salermo an-
nounced that 
the team was 
pursuing a new 
policy of ag-
gressive ste-
roid use. 

"From now 
on, we don't 
take the field 

unti I my kids are strung out on horse 
pills," said Salermo as he brandished 
a large vial of liquid, which he 
claimed was extracted from the pinal 
glands of Honduran lizards. 

"Only top-of-the-line drugs for a 
top-of-the-line team," Salerno said 
with a mischievious smile. 

After announcing his plans to 

field a track team made up of junk-
ies and dope fiends, Salermo intro-
duced the team's newest assistant 
coach - Canadian sprinter Ben 
Johnson. 

"Ob, we'll be feeding them ana-
bolic steriods morning, noon and 
night," Johnson said. "That's the 
only way (0 field a winner nowa-
days." 

"Not that I have any experience 
with drug use," Johnson added. 

When told that distributing drugs 
to college athletes was probably a 
violation of NCAA regUlations and 
almost certainly against federal law , 
Salermo looked stunned. "Is it?" 
Salermo asked. "Then forget I told 
you any of this." 

UCSD Athletic Director Judy 
Sweet was nonchalant by the track 
team's new-found taste for hard 
drugs. "Sure it's illegal, but what 
can you do?" Sweet said. 

At the much-awaited meet 
against Pomona yesterday, the new 
track team philosophy was unveiled 
to mixed results. Triton hammer-

thrower turned sprinter Abi Ravail 
set a team record by covering the 
100 meters in 11.2 seconds. 

"Ravail just started running, and 
he never looked back." Salermo said. 

However, the meet turned ugly 
when Ravail, half-crazed by drugs, 

locked himself in the bathroom stall 
and began to babble about the evil 
dwarves who were "pecking at his 
face." 

"Well, we still have a few kinks 
to work out," Johnson said. "But we 
are definitely on to something." 

I guess the reason I like sports 
- besides the fact that they're 
Outstanding - is because sports 
teaches you life. Remember the 
Winter Olympics. The U.S. 
hockey squad was trailing 
Sweeden 4-1 late in the second 
period. The coach called his 
charges over to the bench and 
gave them a pep talk. "You're 
representing your country," he 
said. "Make America proud."

And do you know what they 
did? They went out and lost any-
how. But that's not the point. 

The point is that they learned 
a lesson while they were play-
ing. They were down, and yet. 
they never looked back. They 
were Outstanding.They play with 
a puck, rather than a ball. Yet I 
cheer for them anyhow. 

I also cheer for all of those 
plucky UCSD squads. The Tri-
ton teams take on all comers and 
they never look back. 

UCSD fans are not Outstand-
ing however. They are directly 
the opposite of Outstanding. 

While UCSD is out there tak-
i ng·on all comers and never look-
ing back, the shiftless UCSD fans 
sit on their hands and yawn. 

When the Tritons played Cal 
Lu in basketball last month, the 
Cal Lu fans outcheered us in our 
own gym. The Lutherans, forcry-
ing out loud! That is neither Out-
standing, nor is it cool. How can 
you learn a lesson from sports 
when you're being outcheered 
by a bunch of Lutherans? 

Lutherans are Outstanding 
too, just not as Oustanding as the 
Big Dog.

Just A Relular Guy 

Senior slugger Bucky Quinn 
doesn't have too many chances to 
get his licks in at the plate. In fact, 

the senior 
t h i r d 
baseman has 
never re-
corded an 
offical at-bat 
during his 
star-studded 
four-year ca-
reer. He is the 
Tritons' offi-
cial bench-
warmer -
but that's just 

the way Quinn likes it. 
"I guess I' mjust unlucky," Quinn 

said of his lifetime .000 average. 
"But then again, I'm just happy to 
be here." 

Quinn is not the most memo-
rable ball player you'll ever see. He 
isn't very fast. and his defensive 
play is subsrandard. Quinn has no 
speed on the base paIhs, and his 
swing can best be desaibeduaickly. 

However, Quinn's workechic: and 
positive attitude have earned him 
the respect of his teammates, who

have affectionately nicknamed him. 
"that guy." 

"Yeah, that guy. He's OK, I 
guess," said first baseman Craig 
Burke. 

"He doesn't get in the way much. 
So 1 don't have much of a problem 
with him," agreed Triton standout 
Chris Miyake. 

UCSD skipper Lyle Yates best 
summed up the team's feelings to-
ward Quinn. "I have no idea who 
you're talking about," Yates said. 
"Now get the hell out of my office." 

Quinn takes such praise in stride. 
"I'm just doing my job:' he said 
with a shrug. "And I am just really 
happy to be here." 

Quinn has two great memories 
from his four years playing with the 
Tritons - the time Miyake said 
hello to him one day in the locker 
room, and the afternoon he was ac-
cidentally beaned during batting 
practice. 

With Triton ace Ryne "Irish 
Whiskey" Flanagan throwing 
Miyake a few rounds of his spe-
cialty vaseline balls, one slipped out 
of his hands and nailed QuiM in the 
beck of the head. 

"ThaI was my greatest thrill as a 
ballplayer," Quinn said.

WWF Intercontinental Champion 

It's been a bumpy ride for UCSD's professional wrestling team 
this year. After last month's setback at the Pt. Loma-Nazarene Battle 
Royale Invitational, the plucky Triton grapplers were looking at their 
first losing season in 12 years. 

What a difference a month makes. With yesterday's amazing 
victory against noted archrival laVerne in the MegawrestlingFest 
held at the San Diego Sport's Arena. the Tritons earned themselves 
a berth in next week's King of the Ring Tournament. 

"We dominated the cowardly laVerne squad," crowed Triton 
Coach "Leaping" Lanny Poffo. "The laVerne squad will not soon 
trifle with us." 

The Triton grapplers got off to a quick strart when senior sensation 
Eric "Big Red" Thomsen slapped the Boston Crab on La Verne's AII-
American wrestler "Thunder" MacDougal and never looked back. 
Thomsen, who learned the technique from former Crab wizard Clam 
Butteranbakeme, brought the capacity crowd roaring to it. .. feet, 
providing hours of Triton tussling action. 

A highlight for Thomsen was when a drop kick to MacDougal set 
the cell members of Cell Block B of the San Diego Penal Cheering 
section scn:aming for blood. 

"I sent MacDougal home crying to his mammy ," boastedTho~n. 
"What you gonna do when Triton-mania runs wild on you." 

UCSD clinched victory when freshman phenom "Yukon" Josh 
Gendron whacked die laVerne pappler over the head with a 2x4 
durina a steel CIF ma&c:h. 

The strInpllllllll:h of the evening had to be in the fourth hour of 
play, when A.S. Director of Refrigerators Wallace Lock-
