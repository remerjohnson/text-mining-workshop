La Jolla Playhouse Embarks on 15th/50th Anniversary 
PERFORMANCE: 
Michael Greif 
discusses 1997 season 
By Ryan Olson 
Staff Writer 

Times arc good at the La Jolla 
Playhou e, as arti stic director 
Michael Grief prepares to launch 
the ensemhle into its 15th-anni ver-
sary season. 

A lthough Greif - a UCS D 
alumnus has becn the 

Playhouse ' ~ a rti ~ ti c dircctor since 
1995, he is probahly most famous 
for hi s directi on of the Tony 
Award-winni ng mu ' ical " Rent." 

" Rent" has becn described as a 
"rock opera," dealing wi th modern-
day residents of New York 's Lower 
East Side. Greif won an Obie 
Award in 1996 for his direction of 
" Rent." Thc musical will make its 
West Coast debut at the La Jolla 
Playhouse in July. 

A graduate student at UCSD, 
Greif left in 1985 with a MFA in 
directing. Hc returncd to New 
York. where he hegan working 

with local theater groups - includ-
ing th e e\\l York Theatre 
Workshop. the same group th at 
eventually launched "Rent." 

A ' preparations are underway for 
the West Coast premiere of "Rent," 
the Broadway company i till se il-
ing tickets. The natiunal lOur cur-
rently performs in Boston. with 
future stops planned for SI. Paul. 
Washington D.C. and Chicago. 

TIle La Jolla Playhouse is cele-
brating its 15th/50th anniversary this 

yea~. Gregory Peck. Mel Ferrer and 
Dorothy McGuire founded tll <.: 
Playhouse in downtown La Jolla in 
1947. It often served as a summer 
stop for vacationing Holly\\lood star. , 
who wanted to do play for 10 weeks. 

Greif said the Playhouse lapsed 
in the 1950s, as fewer actors partic-
ipated in its productions. Arti stic 
Director Des McAnuff rev ived the 
Playhouse at UCSD 15 years ago. 

"[McAnufll very much redefined 
the La Jolla Playhouse into an extra-
ordinarily high quality regional lhe-
ater that did exceptional work." Greif 
said. "Both new work and extraordi -
nary revivals of classic work." 

"I'm thrilled that we 
have a big ole hit 
like 'Rent,' but we 
also have a brand 
new musical as part 
of the season. So 
the work that I feel 
most passionate 
about is brand new 
work." 

- MIchael Greif 
Artistic director 

La Jolla Playhouse 

Greif said hc was very exci ted 
about the other shows the Playhow,e 
ha slated for this season. 

"This season represents an 
ex traordinary mixture f some 
cltlssics and some new work and 
some provocative work," he said, 
"1 hope that all of our seasons are 
such a combination." 

Besides " Rent." thi s season 
ineludes productions of such clas-

ONLINE 'DECENCY' ACT IS

COMMENTARY: The Supreme Court should (and will) overturn the

PIETILA 

According to Florcnce King, 
whose side-splitt ing essays are a 
regular feat ure in National 
Review, America is being held 
hostage - by chi ldren, A li ttle 
more than a year ago King 
observed that, "Americans have 
made such a feti sh of chi ldren 
that adults no longer count -

The second part stipulates that your only defense 
against conviction i demonstrating that you havc taken 
"reasonable, effective and appropriatc actions" to keep 
minors away from objectionable content. Such mca-
sures include using "a veri ficd crcdit card, debit 
account , adult access codc or adult personal identifica-
tion number" to limit access to content that is dcemed 
"indecent" or "patently offensive." 

This is a swceping law, and dcnizens of cyberspace

because ' there were kids in Ihe 
compound.' Afterward she was cas-
tigated because ' Ihere were kids in 
the compound,' A CNN broadcaster 
watching the conflagration cried, 
'My God, there are kid in there!'" 

Remember the 1995 budget bat-
tle between President Clinton and 
the last Congress? It was al ways the 
li ttle children who were trotted out 
as thc potent ial vlcllms of 
Republican budget-cutting,

Well , if the Supr.:: mc ourl 
upholds the ommu nications

no. The courl heard arguments 
March 19 on whether the act (i t's 
actuall y Tit le V of thc 
Telecommunications Act of 1996) 
violates the Firs t Amendment. 

The law has twO cont roversial 
parts. The lirst says that i I' you are 

Believing that 
government 
shouldn't regulate 
speech doesn't 
require believing 
that no speech can 
be harmful, that 
there Is no way of 
determining one 
kind of speech Is 
bad and another Is 
not, or that 
government 
shouldn't regulate 
free speech at all. 

were understandably upset when it 
was passed last year. Thousands of 
web pages changed their back-
grounds to black to commemorate 
the occasion, and a blue ribbon, the 
symbol for "free speech online," 
now adorns sites across the country, 

With the ready avai labilily of 
pornography (some of it ex tremely 
hard-core) on the Internet, it's easy 
to understand why people with fa m-
ilies (including some politicians) 
are concerned about how safe the 
network is for children. And it's 
also easy to see why politician 
thought they could pass a law like 
the CDA: Current Fi rst Amendment 
law permits so-called "zoning" of 
peech that "community standards" 

deem indecent. (For a good discus-
sion of th i , see Jeffrey Rosen's 
piece in the March 31 issue of the 
New Republic). 

Moving shops that sell pornog-
raphy into certai n areas and restrict-
ing televi ed nudity to be broadcast 
duri ng certai n hours arc both exam-
plcs of const itutional re trictions on 
frec peech. 

But opponent of the CDA have 
a good point : Surfi ng the [ntcmet

Online content isn't invo luntarily

go out and find thc content you

dards amount) maleri al to a person under 18 years of 
age, then you have broken the law, 

want. Unless children already know 
where to go to fi nd porn or other "indecent" materia l 
(unfortunately an all -too-common situation), thcy 
won' t see it onl ine,

Individuals are not

They are fairly

Theorem), politi cal scicm;e is still 
infatuated wi th mieroeconomic 
answers to intractable political prob-
lems. It allow them to more em-
ciently lobby for the sort of lucrative 
grants that economists command. 

Another dogma that plagues 
political science is the primacy of the 
nation-state in the shaping of inter-
national relations. One of the unin-
tended consequences of the telecom-
munications revolution is the delo-
cali7.ation of capital and economic 
acti vities. 

Kenichi Ohlllac, Illanagi ng pan-

once observed that the glue that 

SO percent of the funds to activiti'Cs 
for on-campus residents and SO 
percent for commuters. The com-
muter events, however, will be on 
campu~. The idea is that the larger 
,calc the event, the more com-
muters will attend . However, thi s 
plan mainl y caters to the minority 
of Reve ll e ,tudent ~ li ving on cam-
pus. 

The electi ons for these fee~ 
have reqUired at 111 0~t 20 percent 
voter turnout. It would be naive to 
say that those voter, arc a fair rep-
resentallon of those pay ing the fcc, 
as polling booths have been locat-
ed in residenti al areas of the col-
leges. Those aware of these elec-
tions and proposed fees are most 
likely on-cal11pus residents who 
hope to benefit frol11 these rees. 

UCSD's fiv e-college system 

hold nation-states together is dis-
solving: "Buffeted by sudden 
changes in industry dynamics, avail-
able infonnation, con umer prefer-
ences, and flows of capital; bur-
dened by demands for the civi l min-
imum and for open-ended subsidies 
in the name of the national intere t; 
and hog-tied by political systems 
that prove ever less responsive to 
new challenges, these political 
aggregations no longer make com-
pelling sense as di crete, meaningful 
units on an up-to-date map of eco-
nomic [and humanl activi ty." 

Political scjence, in its in i tence 
of seeing nations as the proper units 
of aggregation, is held hostage to a 
vocabulary designed to describe a 
reality that no longer exists. In its 
place, region-states arise as a loose 
confederation of capital and knowl-
edge to generatc locali zed wealth. 
Southern China enjoys a per capita 
im;olllc of 6,000 because of its 
proximity to Hong Kong, in sharp 
contrast to China's average income 
of $400. onhern Italy, with its 
industrial and financial capital, is 
st ill con, idered the !>ame nation as its 
undeveloped ~outhem counterpan.

Inconvenient averages mask the 
true flow of political and financial 
power. It makes no sense to tal k 
about the "average" China or Italy. 
In a borderless world, nations no 
longer exercise the unilateral power 
over their citizen the way they did 
just 30 years ago. Arbitrage traders, 
wi th billions at their command, 
cou nter attempts by governments to 
arti fi cially devalue their currencie ' . 

Local economie like Silicon 
Valley/San Franci co, pull apart 
from the nation, and are influenced 
far more by activi ties in Singapore 
and Malaysia than by the acti vities 
of busybodies in Washington, D.C. 
Attempts to "average in" the wealth 
of Silicon Valley into the nation, or 
even California, obscures important 
data and ultimately undermines the 
pursuit of understanding. 

Is (here room for a di cipline that 
studies the flow of political power in 
an age that is witness 10 the end of 
the nation-state? Yes. But such a 
place can only be secured by what 
all political science academics yak 
about but few are capable of: a para-
digm shirt . 

Don't hold your breath. 

Don't be caught 
by surprise!

U.S. San Francisco District 
Judge Thellon Henderson agreed 
and granted a preliminary injunc-
tion in late December. The initia-
tive' backers took thei r case to the 
federa l appeals court . 

The three appeals judges reject-
ed the ACLU 's argument. ruling 
that the plaintiffs had "no likeli-
hood of success on the merits of 
their equal protection or pre-emp-
tion claims." 

"Plainti ffs challenge 
Proposition 209 not as an impedi -

menl to prolecti on against unequal 
treatment, but as an impediment to 
receiving preferential treatment," 
O'Scannlain wrote. "Impediments 
to preferential treatment do not 
deny equal protection." 

O'Scannlain also issued a sharp 
rebuke that Henderson acted on 
"erroneous legal premi se." 

"A system which permits one 
judge to block wi th the stroke or a 
pen what 4,736,180 state residents 
voted to enact as law tes t~ the

However, UCS D Hi tory

LOCKYER: 
Senate rejection of 
regents i rare 
Continued from page 1 
U.S. Posta l Service Board of 
Governors and the current chair of 
the Board of Regents. Del Junco 
has been a regent si nce 1985. 

Lockyer has called on Wilson to 
retract del Junco's nomination, but 
Walsh said the governor has no 
intention of doing so. 

"The role of the Senate is to con-
finn or deny nominations based on 
qualifications," Wilson spokesman 
Sean Walsh said. "Mr. Lockyer is 
playing purely partisan politics with 
regard to Mr. del Junco." 

Walsh added that Lockyer 's 
actions constitute a "dereliction of 
duty," and that " It 's not Mr. 
Lockyer's place to decide whether 
or not every nominee agrees with 
his ideology." 

Regents can erve for up to a year 
before being confirmed or rejected. 

If Wil son does not wi thdraw del 
Junco's nomination. Lockyer said 
he wi ll begin hearings by mid-
April or early May. 

However. dd Junco said from 
his hOOle last night that he has 
se rved the university and the 
greater community with di stincti on 
and that he hoped he could change 
Lockyer' mind. 

"I don ' t think Senator Lockyer 
is aware of my performance in 
serving the community for 40 
years," del Junco said. 

Del Junco added that he wi ll be 
meeting wi th Lockyer soon. and 
that his record will speak for itself. 

"I am very confident that when 
they look at my record and my per-
formance and my total commit-
ment to the minority community in 
Southern California, that will 
speak for itself," del Junco sa id . 

Regents Peter Parsky and 
Gerald Preuss are al 0 up for con-
firmation, but Lockyer said their 
hearings should be uneventful. 

"Some of the same concerns 
come up, but Parsky and Preuss 
don' t have the same hi tory a del 
Junco," Lockyer said. 

If the Sen ale makes good on its 
threat to oust del Junco, it wou ld be 
hust the third time since the un iver-
sity was founded in 1868 that a gov-
ernor's nominee has been rejected.

"Chasing Amy" star Joey Lauren Adams has come a long way

Don't Be Dazed Or Confused: She got her start on TV's "Married With Children: but Joey Lauren 
Adams wants to shake that image as she moves on to roles on the silver screen. 

STORY BY MARK PAlANSKY, STAFF WRITER 

I' you ha en' l heard of Joey 
Lauren Adams yct. wai t a 
fcw months. By then )OU 
surely will have. You will be 
forking over your live btl 'ks 
($7.50 without your student 

I.D.) to see her 0 1\ the hig ,(;reen. 
She is the star of wri ter/direc-
tor/hoyfriend Kevi n \nith 's 
("C lcrks" and "Mallrats"), 
whose new film , " hasing 
Amy," opens tomorrow. 

Adams plays a leshian, lOrn 
hetween who she thinks shc is 
and who she wants to he . 
Smith, who is now busy writ -
ing "Superman Lives" for 
Warner Bros., wro te" hasi ng 
Amy" as a love leiter to 
Adams. Her performance is so 
brilliant tilat it got a standing 
oval ion at Ihis year's Sundance 
Fi lm Festival. 

Many will also re(;ogni/e 
her as the glTl who "deflow-
ered" Bud l3ul1dy on TV ', 
"Married wi lh Ch ildren ." She 
ha, also appeared in "/)a/eu 
and Confuscd," . Illith 's "Mall-
rat," al1u 1ll ()~ 1 re~e ntl y 111

vo lt u and Andie Macdowell . In 
al1 interview wi th till: 
Guardia/l, Ada lm ta lks ahnul 
every thing from her love wi th 

mith to "Godl.illa. " 
Guardian: What is it that 
draws you to Kevin 
Smith's writing and film· 
making? 

Adams: I just think that it is 
really nice as an actor to go on 
board a project when it is all on 
the page. The majority of the 
work is in memorizing the dia-
logue and going through the 
script and liguring out where to 
be. I think that it does take a cer-
tain kind of actor to deliver hi ' 
dialogue. I don 't think that all 
actors can deliver hi s dialogue. I 
think in a way - a very differ-
ent kind of way - it's like 
Shakespeare because his dia-
logue is very intelligent , and 
you really have to know what 
you are saying to make it believ-
able. You have to understand the 
ex pressions, the hig words. 
Will Kevin continue to 
appear in all of his films? 

I don ' t know if thi s will be

one is going to compare you to 
someone, at least it's good that 
you like who they compare you to. 
Did you expect the huge 
success of "I Kissed a

ADAMS: 
Working with 
Kevin Smith 
Continued from page 9 
hollering, he realized just what 
cultural ieons these characters 
have become. His first response 
was, " We have got to do a 
'Clerks' sequel. " 
How did you prepare for 
this role? 

I have found in the past that if I 
sit before a seene and try to reach a 
dark place so that I am there when 
I go to do it, it doesn 't come. For-
tunately, with Kevin's dialogue, it 
is so good thai it takes you there if 
you really believe what you are 
saying. And I could relate to Alyssa 
[Adams ' character] . I have wanted 
to say those things to Kevin . At the 
very end of the scene in the parking 
lot I actually blacked out. I don't 
remember beating up the car. And I 
was terrified because there is a 
scene in "Showgirls" where Eliza-
beth Berkeley beats up a car, and I 
didn't want to look like that. The 
next thing I heard was "Cut" and 
the whole crew applauded . It was 
really magical. 
Which other actors and 
actresses do you respect? 

My response that I always give 
is Gena Rowlands. I rea lly admire 
her career. If you look at her 
career, she started off in the stu-
dios when there was st i II the stu -
dio system . She really bucked that 
and refused to fall into that. She 
could have become a huge little 
starl et, but I think she wanted to 
make more edgy kinds of fi lms. So 
she went ofT that way and basical -
ly said, "Screw the system." I 
admire that. She always gets work 
and is respected by people that , he 
cares about getting respect from . 
Middle Ameri ca probably doesn' t 
know who she is. hut she prohahly 
doesn' t give a shit. 
So we aren't going to be 
seeing you in "Twister 2." 

Yeah l I auditioned for "Godtil -
la ," but I didn't gel il. I don' t think 
that 1'111 at that poi nt where I can 
only do performance pieces , I 
wouldn't be ab le to support myself. 
I'm not at the point where anyone 
would work wi th me. I sti II have to 
audition and I have to pay my rent. 
Maybe if I married Kevin and he 
was supporting me then I wouldn 't

THE SAINT 
Kilmer successful in pulling off spy job 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Take a heart-throb leading man 
who is both tough and seductively 
soulful , a vivacious leading lady with 
brains, a nasty villian bent upon seiz-
ing power in a s limy and underhand-
ed manner and orne nifty gadgets 
and one has a good staning point for 
any film in the acti on/adventure 
genre. Paramount Pictures' "The 
Saint" has all of these, plus humor 
and good acting to boot. 

Val Kilmer portrays Simon 
Templar, an intemational thief who 
takes on difficult, high-profile 
assig nments for a hefty fee. He i 
known as "The Saint" because the 
names of his many cover identities 
are all the names of Catho li c sai nts, 
a vestigial practice from hi s days in 
a Far East orphanage. 

Kilmer interacts wonderfully 
with Elizabeth Shue, who plays the 
brilliant physicist Dr. Emma Rus-
sell. Templar assumes the guise of 
a wealthy long-maned South 

Saintly: Elizabeth Shue and Val Kilmer on the run from danger 

African artist to seduce Russell and 
obtain her notes on her ground-
breaking scientific di scovery. From 
there, the plot thi ckens. 

Overall , the movie is fast paced, 
has good action sequences and some 
pretty nifty stunts. There is an ele-
ment of romance in there for those 

who go in for that son of thing as 
well. And for a bit of kitsch, fans of 
the old British TV series should lis-
ten closely to the voice of the radio 
announcer at the end of the movie, 
which they should quickly recognize 
as former James Bond and sai ntly 
guy Roger Moore. 

GROSSE POINTE BLANK 
Black comedy shoots and scores 

By Rachel Barg 
Guardian Reporter 

From the tradition o f violent 
co medi es I:omes Hollywood Pic-
ture . "Grosse Pointe B lank," star-
ring John Cusack and Minnie Dri-
ver. This rilm te lls the story of an 
assassin who, di sillusioned with hi s 
joh, returns to the suhurh of Grosse 
Pointe, Mich., for hi s I O-year high 
school reunio n. 

Martin B lank (Cusac k), is the 
top hired killer on the market. In 
pite of hi s success, Martin is 

plagued by a lack of fu lfillment. An 
attempt to fill this void leads Mar-
tin back to his hometown in search 
of Debi (Dri ver), the woman he has 
obsessively dreamed of ever since 
standing her up on prom night. Fol-
lowing Martin is Grocer (Dan 

Aykroyd), a rival hit-man who 
wants to see Manin ei ther join hi s 
assas ' in ~ ' union or die. 

Cusack bnng~ just the ri ght blend 
of cold-hlooded prec ision and an xi-
ety to the ro le of Martin . He and Dri-
ver have good chertllstry a~ the cou-
ple who never forgot one another. 
Debi p()nder~ allowing her one lrue 
love back into her life while the 
complexity of mi xing Manin 's eold-
hlooded career with a relationship 
threatens disaster for both of them. 

The film has enough plot twists 
to keep the viewer intrigued, as 
well as a great soundtrack for any-
one nostalgic for the '80s. Debi, a 
0.1 ., plays an all -'80 nashback 
weekend in honor of her 1986 high 
school graduation. 

Through a skillful blending of

humor and violence, director 
George Armitage creates a quirky 
film that transcends dark comedy, 
revealing the search for meaning 
and fulfillment within us all.

DOUBLE TEAM 
"The Worm" provides lone bright spot 

By Sean Rahlmi 
Senior Staff Water 

Nowadays, it ~eems as if all you need for a 
hit action movie arc star power, great specia l 
effects and an intriguing plot - "Mission 
Imposs ible" and " Era~cr" spring readily to 
mind a examples. So when the producer of 
Colu mbia Pictures ' "Douhle Team," Moshe 
Diamant, ~ucceeded 10 grabbi ng international 
ac tion supe r~tar Jean-Claude Van Damme and 
media sensation Denni~ Rodman, all . ign~ 
pointed to a hit ni ck. 

lIoll ywood, however, 1\ known fur one 
credu: nothing i ~ a sun: thmg. Therefore. it's 
no surpme Ihat "Double Team" fail~ to li ve 
up 10 li S hype - dragging along a thin plot 
while the once-dc~ in;d Van Damme desper-
ately trie, to mimic Jamc~ Bond. Even the 
\olid work of acc laimed Hong Kong directing 
'>c n, ation Tsui Hark (veteran of 50 movie~) 
can't ,ave thi~ project. 

Rodman actuall y bril1g~ ~ome navor and 
c hari~ll1a into his scenes as the movie sputters 
along. As the namboyanJ weapons dealer Yaz, 
the Chicago Bulls' rehounding mac hine gets 
all the wi ll y one- liners toward thc end of the 
movie. Mickey Rourke fill s in admirably as 
thc dangerous enigmatic terrorist Stavros, hut 
IllS character is not devcloped, leaving the 
viewer conru cd about what makes this awc-
Mlmc terrorist tick . 

Though he's the nation's lOp (;Ounter-terr r-
i~t , Jack Quinn (Van Damme) wants to get out 
of the spy game. With a haby due soon and a 
loving wife, Quinn has one last mission to 
orchestrate before he can retire. BUI he misses 
his target (Stavros) in a moment of hesitation 
and loses everything. Consequently. we lind 
him awakening in{he Colony - a holding tank 
for ~ric, who arc tou dangerous to roam the 
planet but too va luable to he ki lied. 

Prom there, Quinn rehabi litates the 
injurle, he ,ulTered during the rai led Stavros 

nll',~ I () n and plans an e~capc from the olony. 
or course, Van Dammc spends about the next

off hi s great kicks - an aspect of hi s movies 
thal has gotten very stale. 

Quinn manages to escape and team up 
with Yaz (Rodman) back in the real world in 
order to stop Stavrm - who in the meantime 
has made Quinn 's wife and unborn son the 
larget of hi s lethal vengeance. 

Peter Pau 's work as director of photogra-
phy is admirable and the special effecls live 
up to the hype. The film includes explosions. 
chases on ai r, land and sea and hand-to-paw 
comoat wilh a Bengal tiger in a land-mine-
peppered Roman Coliseum.

Pulsars, the brainchild f LWO 
Chicago native, brothers David 
and Harry Trumlio, fusc fuzz gui -
tar. Moog-like keyboards. horns 
and a not -quite-annoy in g drum 
track to create a nostalgic fo rm of 
poppy '80s new-wave Ihat wi ll take 
you back. You will he back those 
junior high days when listening to 
New Order and Pet Shop Boys took 
Ihe edge off a long day of pre-alge-
bra and frog di ssection. 

David Trumfio is a self-admitted 
computer nerd, as the names of the 
songs, ueh as "Machine Talk" or 
'"My Pet Robot," obviously suggest. 
In "Silicon Teens," he professes that 
"Silicon teens use drum machines 
and tambourines." 

If Pulsars is the resulJ of long 
hours in the compuler lab. then 
more power to the Trumfios. Even 
though they may be a little late, 
their music is a nice tribute to the 
tunes we enjoyed whi Ie growing up.

Tracey Lee's debul , Mall), Faces, 
can at best he descrihed as medi ocre. 
This new release contains feworigi -
nal thoughts or concepts, and makes 
no attempt at innovation. 

Lee's redemption is his et of 
fi ve alter egos, all of which have 
different deli ve ries. supposedly 
going along with different person-
alities. There's the busines~ person-
alit y, Mr. Lee; the party animal, 
Rock: the serious LR: Tray the 
player; and L. the rhymer. The 
songs featuring these characters' 
humorous interactions are the high-
lights of the album, as any spectac-
ular lyrical demonstrations are 
lacking throughout. 

The album's beat are di ap-
poinling, many of which are remi-
ni cent of other recent beats in sim-
pler forms. 

Basically, there is nothing spe-
cial in Lee's debut - an average 
produclion from an average MC.

Lutefisk has overthrown lhe 
stale conve nt ions of the indie-pop 
style and has taken over a the 
deran ged ruler of the underground 
Silverlake, Ca l. . scene with it 
second release. 811m ill Hell 
Flickers! 

The 13 lracks featured on the 
foursome's new release arc a hodge-
podge of psycho- pop, charming 
count ry and riot-rock that only Lute-
fi sk can succes fully pull ofr. The 
highlight s include the band 's one-of-
a-kind covers of Bikini Kill 's "Rebel 
Girl," and Wild Cherry's "Play that 
Funky Mu ie," accentuating the 
band's versatility and abi lity to shift 
from jarring screams to a melodic 
groove. 

As the Silverlake scene quickly 
emerge as an off-kilter haven for 
aels sueh as Beck and PopOefect, 
Lutefisk 's characler and talent wi II 
also help breathe new life into the 
indie-rock identity.

ADAMS: 
Dealing with the 
Hollywood scene 
Continued from page 10 
have to worry about money. We 
made peanuts on "Chasing Amy." 
The onl y rca on I wa able to do 
"Amy" i because I did 
"Michael" at the same time and 
made my rent on that. 
You seem more inclined to 
stay away from the Holly. 
wood scene. 

Yeah, I don ' t like the glamour 
- Planet Hollywood, going oul 
al night and dressing up. I'm an 
overall kind of girl. I like people, 
I'Ill not anti -social . But for me. its 
not about heing seen and getting 
your picture taken. I hate getting 
my picture taken. I' ve secn peo-
ple that arc hot for thc month and 
on evcry magazine cover. They 
get this attitude like thcy wil l 
never 10 e il , and then next month 
it 's someone else. It 's easy to 
think thai yo u' re the beSI and 
you're the greatest in this busi-
ness because you are constant I y 
pampered. When you're staying 
in the finest hotels and designers 
are loaning you their clothcs to 
wear, you can' t help but slart to 
feel importan t. In aClua lity, 
you're really not. You're actually 
rea lly lucky. There are so many 
people who would love to be 
doing what I am doing. 
What do you think about 
acton like Robert Downey 
Jr. and River Phoenix -
young acton who were 
unable to handle the pres-
....... of Hollywood? 

I think it's sad and they are vic-

HIATUS HI 3 

tims of Hollywood. I've seen it 
happen to people around me. There 
are a lot of people that I eame up 
with from "Dazed and Confused" 
that I have 'cen change and made 
into extremely insecure pe pie. 
They can't be alone and they start 
complaining about everything. 
How can you not have fun on a 
film? How can you si t and com-
plain about it? It ·s the grealest 
experience in the world. It' just so 
awful to hear, especially since 
there are lruggling people out 
there. I'm ju ·t lucky that I have a 
mom that keeps me very grounded 
and a great family. I come from a 
great place. I don 't need a lot to 
excile me. A good episode of "111e 
X-Files" will do it for me every 
time. 
Do you stiD talk to David 
Faustino (Bud Bundy)? 

I will never live that down. 
"Married with Children" is not 
one of my ravorite shows, butlhat 
episode was a very spccial Bundy 
episode. I can' t go into a hard-
ware store or gas station without 
getting recognized. That is not 
what I want to he rccognizcd for. 
What ran through your 
mind when "Chasing Amy" 
received a standing ov. 
tion at the Sundance Film 
Festival? 

Relief. It was the firsl time that 
I was really able to watch the film 
as a whole. I was an emotional 
wreck. Thank God the film tart-
cd late and we had no time for Q 
and A, because if someone were 
to even ask me my name I proba-
bly would have burst into tears . It 
was a very efTIotional screening, a 
lot of wet eyes. The people there 
really got it.

How do you go about writ· 
ing your songs? 

Writing is a very odd thing for 
me. Last year I went through ahout 
four months of writer's block. Ii \ 
one of the most painfullhings that 's 
ever happened to me. I had II 
hefore, and I think part of tht: rea-
,on was IIKlt to write you have to go 
out and gel a life and I th ink, "Yeah, 
weill have a wri ter'> block because 
I have really nothing to wri te 
about." So I think that Mopping, nOI 

feelinggu tlty.Ju~t say ing. "OK, l'm 
not wri ting, I' m just goi ng to go 
and do other things," was actually a 
really wonderful thing 10 do. 
Was there one point where 
all of a sudden you feU 
things click again? 

lowly. but yeah. Ii ki nd of 
crept up on me. I think also I was 
ltrcd of my guitar and I need to find 
new tooh to write to get inspired. 

I had thi s song on thi s aibulll . 
which is called "Super 8," about 
home movies and I mention a 
Carol Fengel. The line is "Carol 
Fenge l before she sli ced her 
wri:.t" and il was just a name from 
the pa~t. It wasn't an actual pcr on 
who had slit their wrist. Last week 
when I wa, III Denver the aClual 
Carol Fengel came up and she 
hadn ' t seen the new album and 
... he was ... ayl ng. "We ha ven't 
heard the new album but I love the 

la~t album." I was like, "Oh my 
God ," ~o I have to call in to her. I 
was too chicken to say, "It 's not 
really about you , I just used your 
name hecau~e It sounded good." 
You've got to be careful , hut at the 
~ame time you ' ve got to think of 
the creati ve rrolits as well .

Hi brother, Stephane, was the

the fourt h game, however, because 
they had played a suspended 
defen eman, Greg Spenrath . The 
Aces then defeated the Falcons in 
the fi fth and deciding game Tues-
day night , 5-3. 

The championship series prom-
ises to be exciting. The game, like 
any Gulls match, should be high-
li ghted by plcnty of scoring and 
physical play. Game six and seven 
will be held at the Spons Arena. if 
necessary, on Apri l 22 and 24. 

Come out and support your San 
Diego Gulls. They're fun to watl:h, 
and it's inexpensive for semi -big-
time hockey. Unles you'd rather 
drive to Anaheim and pay in excess 
of $50, this is your best het. 

Be careful not to forget Gulls 
tradition. Just follow these three 
simple steps: Every time the Gulls 
score I.) taunt the opposing goalie 
by yelling hi s name, 2.) count up the 
number of goa ls the Gulls have 
scored on him 3.) finish it off with a 
rousing "It 's all your fault, you 
suck l " You, too, can be a Gu lls 
fanatic . They're yours to adopt.

the second game turned out differ-

Coac h Robert Fletcher's young 
troops gained confidence from 
those garnes, proving that they 
could play with , and heat , any team

"We' re doing everyth ing we can 
to get to the pl ayo ffs and now we

got to di sh out tbe beating, 15-7. 
The UC D offense wa~ cli cking, 
pounding out 17 hit s, including 
~even doubles. Ten different Tri-
ton playe rs had at least one hit , 
and seven of them had atl ea~ttwo. 

Interestingly, the Tritons were

A Triton Report Card 

The third and fourth 
inning~ had the same ef-
fec I. UCSD entered the 
fifth ahead comfortably, 
9- 1. ' ro m th ere. they 
crui sed to a IS-run per-
fo rman ce . Takehara 
pitcbed five innings to gct 
thc win . 

Goldsmith led the way 
for the Tritons, go ing two 
for three wi th two rllns 

PitchIng: Takehara kept them B- in it early, but when your offense gives you 15 runs, pitching isn 't Quite as important anymore. 
Bats: 17 hits + 7 dOUbles = 15 A • runs. Funny, that is also the equa-

Hrtion tor Coach Fletcher's happi-
ness. 

Defense: True, the Tritons had B three errors, but come on, how badly did it really hurt them on this 
day?

Gustavus, UCSD wasn' t able to

ship. Winning it s 

first championship in 10 years, 
UCSD took the game by a score 
of 24-6. 

The game remained tight 
through the first half, with UNL V 
keeping it close. The half ended 
with UCSD ahead, 7-6. By the 
start of the second half, it be-
came apparent that UN LV was 
not as fit as UCSD, despitc it 
size advantage. 

Playing in a stadium before a 
large crowd, UCSD displayed a 
slew of hits that had the crowd 
"ooing" and "aahing." In the,ec-
ond hal f, Aaron Smith had a big 
hit that shl fted the momentum in 
UCSD's favor.

UCSD fared extremely well in 
Saturday's improved parking-lot 
criterium. In the men's A race, 
UCSD often lacks most of its top 
competitors, who generally com· 
petc in higher profile race. How-
ever, at Ml. Baldy UCSD entered 
three participants in this category: 
Ian Bellinger, Adam Li vi ngston 
and Lee Lefkowitz. 

UCSD defi nitely felt thei r pres-
ence as they scored some very 
important points. Bellinger would 
be the man of the hour in the A 
race, sprint ing away from the fi eld 
to place firs\. 

Thc cycli sts from San Diego

There ' s only one thing to fini sh. Pre viously , the lacrosse 
do - throw it :md hope women fini shed fourth place in 
you score. It ' s going to go 
in, of cour e - it 's your dream. 

UCSD " Amy Haselfeld lived 
the dream Sunday, as the UC D's 
women ' s lacrosse team took on 
the University of Arizona. With 
six seconds left in overtime, he 
fou nd herself with an open shol. 
Hasclfeld wisely took it to score 
her fifth goa l of the day, earning 
the victory and the No. I spot in 
the Southern Division of the West 
Coas\. 

The hero of the day was 
Haselfeld . Not only the team 's 
leading scorer, she was in the 
right place at the right time. 
Teammate Sian Beilock al 0 per-
formed well , scoring four goals, 
while Kati e Galvin and 
Angeliquc Bonner each poured 

the Final Four, being barred by 
powerhouse teams such as UC 
Davi s, U Berke ley and 
Stanford . 

"Most of us were just rookies 
last year, but we don ' t have a 
team feeling of nervousness," co-
captain Galvin said . "It' s more 
just anxiousness and eagernes . 
We reall y want to win ." 

This weekend brings team 
from all over the West Coast to 
the Western States tournament in 
Santa Cruz, where UCSD will 
face UC Berkeley - a team they 
are likely to face in the Final 
Four. 

"Everyone is just really po i-

great team spirit. "
