Regents to Visit Third College Tomorrow 
Carl Neiburger 

City Editor 

A group of Regents will visit Third 
College tomorrow. Headed by Mrs. 
Eleanor Heller, chairman of the 
Regents' Committee on Educational 
Policy, the party will speak with 
representatives of Third College, 
department and faculty committee 
chairmen, the three provosts, and Third 
College critic Dr. Jack Douglas. 
Douglas was included in the program at 
the request of the Regents. 

assistant, had telephoned him to ask him 
to meet with the Regents and he agreed. 
He declared he was not prepared to 
discuss anything in particular, but would 
answer the Regents' questions. 

advanced syllabuses, lecture outlines, 
and more defined expectations. He 
added that students also asked for 
" more of a communal learning 
situation, in contrast to highly 
individualized learning, and more 
immediate feedback regarding their 
progress during the course." 

Asked about the Regents' request to 
speak with Douglas, Watson said it was 
"understandable," as Douglas is "very 
vocal in his criticism of Third College." On the positive side, he noted that 

students "praised the availability of 
some professors in appearing at 
sections." They also " reaffirmed 
student involvement in curriculum 
planning and expressed enthusiasm for 
the Science and Technology sequence," 
besides "affirming the relevance of the 
Communications program and Third 
World Studies." 

Provost Watson said he believed the 
visit to be a "follow-up to an. invitation 
which I offered them (the CEP) to visit 
Third College before the school year is 
out in order to let them meet the faculty 
and students most directly involved in 
the college and the faculty involved in 
teaching Third College courses. " He 
said this included, specifically, the 
members of the Third College Board of 
Directors. 

Watson stated, in response to a 
question, that a "strong possibility" 
exists that Third College may be used as 
a political tool to influence Regents in 
the chancellor search. He declared that 
" the only thing we can do is to work 
hard to guarantee that the program is 
sound, to avoid even the most minor of 
mistakes, and to be as open as possible 
when such mistakes occur to show they 
are due to human frailty ." With regard to governance, Martinez 

said, "Third College from the beginning 
never wanted to see the provost position 
turned into a despot position." The 
convocation, he declared, " reaffirmed 
the principle," declaring that the Board 
of Directors must actively seek the 
feelings of the groups they represent in 
order to be effective. He added that the 
group decided "students need more 
information as to operational 
procedure in Third College," observing 
that increased information would make 
the committees more effective. 

Watson said the Regents' Committee 
had not visited Third College since it 
was in the planning stages a year ago. 
He noted that the Third College 
representatives would describe the 
college's programs and answer the 
Regents' questions about them. 

In the meantime Third College held its 
first annual convocation last 
Wednesday. Dean Pascual Martinez told 
the TIMES that the college by-laws 
provide for the college community to 
meet at the end of each year to evaluate 
its academic role, its administrative 
functions , and the college as a 
community. After hearing a report from 
Provost Watson, the convocation broke 
up into workshops dealing with each 
topic. They later reassembled to report 
on their conclusions. 

Douglas Unaware of Reasons 

Douglas told the TRITON TIMES he 
was unaware of the reason for the 
Regents' visit. He said that Phil James, 
the chancellor ' s administrative 

More Structuring Asked 
The convocation concluded that Third 

College is "on the way" to developing as 
a community, but that it must "work 
harder towards a common goal of Third 
College as primarily a learning 
community." 

In the academic area, Martinez said, 
students requested more structuring of 
some courses. He noted they requested

Perhaps the most unusual feature of the 17-month search for 
a new chancellor has been the emergence of erious support for 
a man who has not been cleared by the campus search 
committee. 

That man is Hardin B. Jones. a UC Berkeley medical 
professor who has earned wide reputation as an outspoken 
critic of drug u e among the young. 

"Ordinarily. I'm not political." Jones told the TIMES. "but 
omeone has got to peak out on the i sue ." 
Jones has add res ed numerou local citizens groups in the 

past few months; Citizens for Better Education has bcen 
formed for the purpose of advancing his candidacy : and Dr. 
Donald J . Kintner. a Rancho Santa Fe management consultant 
who i chairman of that group. has estimated that 20.000 letters 
of support for Jones have been ent to the Regents. 

"Thousands Involved" 

"The movement involves reallv thousands of well-known 
people from the San Diego area:" Jones said. "and thi is 
under tandable since I am a fairly well known man in 
California. " 

The TIMES has not been able to confirm the 20.000 figure .

Two members of the Regents' Advisory Committee for the San 
Diego chancellorship aid they have seen all the mail sent to 
the Regent in support of Jone . but there were only about 500 
letters. 

But independently of each other. both of these Regents added 
words to the effect that : " If you count the entire member hip 
of every club or organization that sent a letter of endorsement, 
then you might get 20.000. But that houldp 't really count. .. 

RegarJless of actual numbers. the Jones movement has had 
at least one important effect: upporter of Clifford Grobstein 
for chancellor could no longer claim that their man had the 
monolithic upport of the San Diego busine s community. 
Grobstein came neare I to being appointed in March and April , 
and it was at thi time that most of Jones' mail was coming in. 
Thus just when Grobstein 's business support might have been 
on the verge of persuading Governor Reagan to favor him. that 
support appeared to divide into two camp . 

Several influential Jones upporters attended one Regents' 
meeting in this period I the TIMES does not know which 
meeting I . According to snatches of information from a variety 
of sources. these men impre sed some Regent . particularly 
the ones who hold their eats through their political offices. 
that Grob tein 's support wa not as solid as had once been 
thought. 

Kintner Claimed Near Victory 

In an interview granted to the TIMES. Kintner said he 
believes Jone would have been appointed in either March or 
April if Pre"ident Hitch had made the nomination to the 
Regent . Kintner said that he had talked to all the Regent who 
were in the country. and felt a ured that Jone could 
co:nmand majority upport It President Hitch would make the 
nomination . 

The TIl\IES has been unable to confirm thi . General 
indication ' are. however. that Jone" could not at any time hav 
ecured the majority ot vote he would have ne ded to b come 

chancellor. 
The main reason for thl . mo t ource f el. i ' that th 

Campu arch Committ e has not cl ared Jones. By 
tradition. the Pre ident will onl~' make a nomination with 
the agre m nt ot the 10 al earch committe . and b~· law . the

not unders!and the depth of feeling of the people in this state. 
Kintner :;aid he felt frustrated trying to effect a change when 

a tiny minority of men were blocking that effort. 
If a constitutional measure were placed on the state ballot to 

limit terms of the Regents to four years, Kintner said he 
thought it would pass overwhelmingly. 

Kintner said that he and others had the organization to do 
this if they wanted to. He sa id that there were hundreds of 
thousands of people in California waiting for the call, and that 
all they were lacking was con istent leadership. 

Organized Revoll Possible 

Kintner also discussed with the TIMES the possibility of an 
organized taxpayers revolt. He sa id thaf it had happened 
before ; that they had thrown tea in Boston Harbor . He said 
that the issue was the same : taxation without representation. 

Kintner stre sed that he was not saying that the people 
should or would go as far as an organized refusal to pay taxes. 
But what could be done if they did ?, Kintner asked 
rhetorically. He noted that there would be no way to place all 
the people who refused to pay taxes in jail. 

Kintner repeated several times that he felt the people were 
ready to act. and that all they lacked was a leader. 

Kintner aid that his only interest was to get a chancellor at 
UCSD who could insure that kids coming out of the University 
would be as good as they were when they first went in .

personally by Hardin Jones for support. 
Jones does have certain important qualifications for the job. 

He is assistant director of the Donner Medical Research 
Laboratories at UC Berkeley. and he has done important work 
in the field of medical statistics. 

"Mucb to Offer" 

Jones attributes other qualifications to himself as well. " I 
am competent in the fields of psychology, sociology. physics, 
bio·physics . demography, and mathematics," he said . " 1 am a 
scienti st who has much to offer in solving the problems of 
higher education." 

Jones sees lack of motivation as one of the biggest problems 
of today's youth. He attributes this to the "miseducation" 
many of them have received. as well as to a breakdown in the 
"permanent va lues." " I have a great deal of experience in 
motivating students, " Jones said. "The students that are in 
touch with me become motivated ... .I know how I compare 
with other men in this area and I know that I have talent. " 

Jones said thal UCSD needs a chancellor who is "more than 
just a conservative." In this connection, Jones specified three 
areas in which the University ought to do more : 

(! I Students ought to be taught better " how to express 
themselves accurately." 

(2) The University ought to develop a serious health 
program. Jones believes such a program. properly conceived, 
cou ld " extend the useful life of students 20 or 30 years." 
Physic.al education, he said. "can provide a sense of personal 
attainment even if all the larger social problems have not been 
solved. " 

(31 Jones said the Universi ty ought to train students ' ' to do 
something useful. . .so that some day they can make a 
contribution to society ." 

Jones is probably best known for his outspoken attacks on 
drug use among the young. He has also attacked cigarettes, 
alcohol. and an overweight condition as having the same long 
term effect: a shortened, less vigorous life. 

" I was the only one to predict the heroin epidemic we are 
now in, " Jones said .

Peace Voters Start 
Registration Drive 

Sorb Simon 
SlaH Writer 

The UCSD Young Voters for 
Peace are sponsoring a voter 
registration drive this week as 
a support activity for their 
letter, which has been sent to 
all students. In the letter, YVP 
states that " the newly . 
enfranchised voters will take 
the initiative to register and 
vote and therefore must be 
counted as a significant factor 
in the next election." 

card asks each voter to pledge 
tha t they will (1) insist upon 
withdrawal of all U.S. military 
personnel from Indo-China by a 
specified date in the immediate 
future , and (2) insist upon the 
exercise of Congressional 
authority over decisions 
affecting matters of war and 
peace. 

Voter registration tables will 
be on a II three college 
campuses, as well as the 
Medical School, Wednesday 
through Friday from 11 a.m. to 
2 p.m. YVP member Barb 
Rodgwick explains that 

,everyone between the ages of 
18 and 21 can register to vote 
here only if their parents live in 
San Diego County, or else if 
they are married and therefore 
are no longer legal minors. 
Others in the 18-21 age category 
must register in the county 
where their parents reside, she 
adds. 

The ' pledge campaign has 
received support from more 
than 60 UCSD faculty , 
according to Barb Rodgwick. 
She sa ys tha t there will be 
collection boxes for the cards 
at the voter registration tables 
and a t other central locations 
on campus. 

In their letter, YVP states a 
hope to receive one million 
signed pledge cards nationwide 
which will be forwarded to 
President Nixon, with copies to 
the members of Congress and 
to the National Headquarters 
for the Republican and 
Democratic parties. 

A second action taken by the 
YVP is a pledge card campaign 
which they also mention in 
their letter to the students. The 

Any questions about YVP, 
the voter registration or pledge 
card drives may be addressed 
to Barb Rodgwiclt, P.O. Box 
4657, on campus.

Comes In Many Guises 

LSD, the highly publicized illegal drug that 
sends a user off on an unreal " trip," is still in 
plentiful supply in San Diego County. The drug 
comes in many forms. It can be a powder, a 
capsule or different colored pills. It can be 
impregnated paper or a "window pane" which 
is LSD mixed in gelatin, hardened and cut into 
small squares. 

LSD has been added to a variety of other 
substances and even foods. Apparently LSD has 
lost some of its popularity because dealers in 
illegal drugs have been passing it off lately as 
mescaline, "organic" mescaline, STP, 
Psylicobin or any other hallucinogen that they 
think users might buy. In all instances lately in 
which drug identi~ication has been requested 
for mescaline, the illegal drug by chemical test 
has been LSD. 

Powerful And Dangerous 
LSD is available only from illegal sources, 

The dosage is never predictable. It is a very 
powerful drug. A speck of LSD can affect the 
user for trom eight to ten hours. Striking 
distortions may occur in the physical senses as 
to what the user sees, touches, smells and 
hears. A single ounce is enough to provide 
.. trips" for 300,000 users. The good or bad LSD 
trip varies greatly, depending upon the amount 
of LSD which is taken, the personality of the 
user, his expectations, the setting in which the 
drug is taken, and other factors. 

Debunking Claims 
Does LSD have the magical properties 

ascribed to it by some devotees who claim they 
are more crea tive and/or have deeper religious 
insights while under its influence? The answer 
is " no." During an LSD " trip," the individual 
loses his ability to discriminate and evaluate. It 
is very common for a LSD user to believe that 
the music he has composed or the painting he 
has painted is far greater than what he could 
have done without using the drug. However, 
scientific experiments have proven that this is 
solely within the mind of ·the LSD user. 
Research studies, carried out under laboratory 
conditions, comparing an individual's creative 
ability before and after LSD experiences, 
revealed no significant increase in the person 's 
abilities.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The Disc Jock 

Editor: 

Most of the people in this 
school probably couldn·t care 
less about the inner workings of 
KSDT. But since it is our 
student fees that support the 
station, I think there are some 
things that everyone should be 
aware of. 

After a full year as a disc 
jockey, I was "dismissed" 
from the staff of the station 
last week. The reasons were 
quite simple : I have been a 
vocal critic of the current 
management staff's policies, 
and these people refuse to 
listen to criticism. My 
complaints are that those in 
control have been entirely 
unresponsive to suggestions for 
change, and have been setting 
down rules without bothering to 
consult the people who must 
carry them out l the disc 
jockeys ), or giving reasons for 
the rules. The specific 
issues-news tapes and 
engineering logs - are 
irrelevant ; my complaint is 
with the dictatorial attitude of 
the current station manager 
and program director. 

We have a chance to do 
something abou t the situation. 
The Communications Board 
will soon be choo~ing the 
station manager for next year. 
I urge the Board to consult the 
disc jockeys, who are the ones 
who must work with a station 
manager and carry out his 
policies, as to their feelings 
about the candidates. and to 
elect a candidate who is not 

only a techniCian. but knows 
how to work with people as 
well. 

Glenn Oleon 

You Who Are 
Editor: 

Currently, 20 states of a 
required 38 have Signed an 
amendment to the Federal 
Constitution which will allow 
everyone above the age of 18 to 
vote on a local, state, and 
national basis. This constitutes 
enough young people " power" 
to have changed the outcome of 
the presidential election in 1960 
(Kennedy vs. Nixon ) and 1968 
( ixon vs. Humphrey ). This 
new group of voters possesses a 
considerable amou nt of 
political persuasive power 
(fairly soon Reagan may have 
to treat us nicely, assuming 
that nearly all the people in 
college are older than 18 and 
that they do not really care for 
him). 

To the fraction of people who 
voted for Shaw in the recent AS 
election because " he looks 
more like a radical than 
Kaufman" or "I think he 's got 
a far-out campaign poster:" I 
shudder to think what kind of 
damage you would do to a 
national election. The basis of 
the IS-year old vote is centered 

around the controversy. "Are 
the l8-2l group respoalible 
enough to vote wisely?" Are 
we? 

I, personally, voted for Shaw 
(seriously hoping he would get 
in) because I wanted : (I) to see 
him keep his campaign 
promise and allow the AS to Tot 
(by doing nothing) ; and (2) to 
make Kaufman realize that 
some of his campaign 
platforms were obvious 
platitudes and that some people 
don't like bullshit. (Also, if 
Shaw stepped down, as he said 
he would, then logically, Tom 
Caryl would have probably 
been the next president.) 

Next time, I suggest that 
everyone who voted for some 
queer reason. like, "Shaw's 
cool," " I like Keating 's 
dimples," or " I'm Kaufman's 

girlfri~d" had better start 
looking through the platitudes 
and tainted promises. If you 
consider the AS a farce then go 
ahead and waste your vote on 
Mickey Mouse, as do roughly 10 
to 20,000 other people every 
Federal election since 1952 
because they may think the 
Federal Government Is a farce . 
Just don't complain when the 
president does something you 
don't like. 

Grow up and think; this is the 
conflicting world-not junior 
high school. 

Elliott H. Ucbiyama 
Revelle Junior 

Do It Yourself 
Editor: 

The most recent crisis on 
campus. according to local 
definition . is the financial aids 
deficit for students who cannot 
pay the exorbitant " public" 
school fees. The solution which 
is being proposed is to support 
the program by instituting an 
additional fee for all students. 
If the measure is passed, all 
will be well (for the time 
being) . But what will those who 
voted for the fee do if it lail to 
pass '! 

Remember , no law or 
resolution can, of itself, be 
binding on anybody. You are 
not forccl! to pay $212 every 
quarter for your education , and 

may use your ,money in any 
way you see fit. If you answer 
this: " But, I need the credits to 
graduate! " then you are only 
supporting the system which 
gives diplomas to those who 
can buy them, and denies the 
honor (?) to all others. If you 
really believe in education for 
everybody who wishes to study, 
don't register for classes next 
quarter, and donate your fees 
to EOP. Only by such action 
can we demonstrate a true 
belief in an equal opportunity 
for everyone to a ttend the 
public university . 

Jonalban Delbruck 

No Drive 
Editor: 

The Revelle course 
requirements are designed to 
shape well-rounded individu'lls. 
It's a great idea but it has been 
carried to an extreme, This 
campus lacks drive . Many 
people are uninterested in the 
courses they are forced to take. 
Likewise, professors who are 
forced to teach required 
courses cannot be expected to 
fully apply themselves to their 
work . A healthy attitude is 
essential if satisfaction is to be 
derived from a university 
education, and the extensive 
and often uninteresting 
requirements only serve to 
stifle such an attitude. 

Not only are lower division 
requirements excessive, but 
major requirements are also 
too prevalent. I suggest that 
the Revelle general education . 
requirements be halved in 
order to allow individuals to 
pursue their own interests. 

It has been argued that many 
students do not know where 
their interest lies upon 
entrance to this school and that 
it is the duty of the benevolent 
University to guide them along 
the right path. A far better 
solution would be to allow the 
individual the freedom to find 
his own interests . The 
satisfaction of se ll -
achievement far outweighs the 
gains derived from a 
compulsory program.

THE RIGHT WING SPEAKS 

One Battle, Not the War 
Jim Sills 

Sitting in the TRITON TIMES office a few days after the 
Keating-Kaufman runoff election , I was orten asked the arne 
question. "After alL K~ufman beat the conservative 81 per 
cent to 19 per cent ; Isn t that the tinal defeat of the Right on 
campus?" It was suggested that our principles had suffered an 
ultimate rejection : and that we were lell only to fold up ur 
tents and. In the leltcltous phra e of Leon Trotsky. "go and 
take your place on the dust heap of history." . 

But we won·t. . 
No, but Yes 

And not entirely because we are cranky old politicians, 
either. For while Karl and I heard " no" from the students ' lips 
we saw "yes" in their eyes. What do I mean? I mean that th~ 
issues which DIMENSION and the campus Right raised , 
developed, fought for, and saw through. generally won broad 
majority support. In November we asked the students to 
declare themselves against 11) the Left's violent tactics' ( 2 ) 
having student strikes abruptly called without an election ;' and 
13) the AS Council's habit of trying to speak in the students' 
name on national issues. On all three of these we were opposed 
by the same Paul Kaufman and friends who so thoroughly 
thrashed us last week. Kaufman voted against all three in the 
AS Council. When the November referendum was held. 
however, all three passed with "yes" votes ranging from 62 per 
cent to 67 per cent. 

Similarly. on the question of AS sa laries it was a front page 
story in the Feb. 17 D1MEf'iSIOl'\ which lirst raised the issue. 
It was the Right which circulated the petitions. wrote the 
arguments in the TRITOi'\ TIMES. and carried the fifth 
through two referendums before a solid 61 per cent of the 
student voted to cut AS sala ries in half. 

Almost a Victory 

Voluntary membership in AS was our last fight. Three years 
ago. the students voted 75 per cent to tax themselves an 
additional six dollars. This time the Right rallied 45 per cent of 
those voting. against mandatory fees. ;\;ot a victory. certainlv. 
but very clo e to a majority . '. 

All of these issue were preci ely the pillars of Karl 
Keatlng 's campaign for the presidency : an end to violence and 
manipu lation . a reduction 01 AS salari es . the cutting down to 
size of the AS by means of voluntary mem bership and fees .

Kautman opposed a policy against building takeovers : he 
opposed the requiring of an open election before a strike could 
be called: he opposed lin a Feb. 26 column in the TRITON 
TIMES ) any reduction in AS salaries. and opposed voluntary 
I ees in hi platform. . 

It seems safe to say. then. that the student" did not vote on 
the local A.S. i 'sues in the runoff. Rather they voted, 
overwhelmingly. to Stop The Right-Winger. Thus was 
Kautman almost always able to take the wrong side on almost 
~ny controversy and still win easily. When ideology was not an 
Issue. Kaufman was defeated b.v a candidate previously 
unknown 1 DaVid Shaw I • 

"Stop the Fascist!" 

It was ·ymbolic. certainly. that Shaw {who had been 
endorsed by Keating in the first run-off as per a pre-primary 
agreement ' could not bring himseJt to endorse Keating in the 
final runoft . For Sha w. as with mo -t of the voters. stopping the 
fascist was more important than changing AS government . 
Perhaps now the reader can understand the true significance of 
David Shaw's retusal to take office. A chance for reform has 
been postponed at least for one year . 

But. as for the Right. we are not discouraged. Three 
members of DIME SION's staft won half of the six student 
places in the recent Revelle College elections. All are in their 
first vea r at UCSD. 

Even more encouraging. however. are certain election 
figures which ha ve come to light. After six months the ballots 
in last f'iovember's referend um have been released and 
analyzed ror their results by sex. college. and the year of each 
student 1 about one third 01 the ballots were marked for thi 
information I. 

Perhaps most revealing are the ligures on the question or 
opposing building takeovers_ window smashing. class 
disruptions. etc. The "yes" vote varied fro m a low of 51 per 
cent among seniors to a high of 70 per cent among freshmen. At 
Reve lle. senior guys voted on ly 32 per cent "ye ." treshman 
girls 86 per cent "yes." The overall figures conlirm thi s trend . 
and the message is clear. Tho e who manned and defended the 
Revolution during the student strikes of a while back are 
leaving . Freshmen and ophomores who know little it anything 
of such things are in growing in number . A day will come 
when the voting iss:Je will be "reform AS government. "

Surfing Is. 
Terry Barak 
Arts Editor 

• • 

My quest for the perfect wave. or the closest thing to it available on that cold 
fogg~' morning in February . began at the cliff overlooking Black's Beach . My 
companion and I sighed with disgust as we looked down into the foggy grey void : we 
couldn't see the beach. the water . much less any waves . But we could hear the pound 
of surf. Thi was that Tue day morning of the great LA earthquake, and overnight a 
trong swell had come out of somewhere. 
We knew. by the sound alone. that there was surf down there ; so. what else, but go 

down. Once on the beach we lound that we were able to see only a sketchy haze of the 
thick whitewater pouring in . As we watched for a few minutes. trying to summon 
the courage. or idiocy . to go out. we saw out of nowhere a kneeboarder come 
tracking across a wave. His speed was tremendous ; for the first time we knew about 
how big the surl wa labout 7' I being able to compare the wave ' size with its rider ; 
our kneeboarder was shooting across his wave when it suddenly sectioned on top of 
him-his board went flying airbound. and he disappeared under the soup. Black's is a 
hard enough place to ride when it is sunny; we decided it wasn 't worth it in these 
conditions of zero visibility . 

The best thing to do. [thought. was to go up North County way to Swami-so Since it 
is a reef break. waves generally start breaking in the same place every time. their 
shape is morc con istent : thereby. a far better place to be in times of poor visibility . 
Enroute to Swami ·s. we tried in vain to see how the swell looked at beaches along 
the way : it was so foggy that we couldn-t even see the water from the highway. 
Afterarriving at our destination, we stood atop the cliff overlooking Swami 's Reef ; 
to our di may. we couldn 't even see the water from there. By this time we had come 
this far in quest of waves. so what the hell : with hearts in mouth. and a healthy fear 
of the unknown. we started to paddle out through the shorebreak . 

Drop in, track; throw your weight back, lean into the 
wave with all you've got . .. 

You feel your way across the wave as much as you see it 
because it all happens so fast . .. 

It was the welrllest tceling In the world. I telt like I was entering a ditterent world . 
tlllcu perhaps With doom or great reward : but lOr certain. with surprises. On a good-

s i ~ed day. Swam i' s breaks about one quarter to one ha If mile out. Alter five minutes

1:11'1 , truck the wave bottom. then tollowed b~' a sustaIned roar of the white soup .

Surfing is "getting away from it all ." It is an escape from reality, or at least Into a 
different reality. It brings to mind questions of which reality is more valid. For me, 

. it is highly conducive to thought ; to thinking about the world. my problems, my 
ecstasies. Being isolated by the water from the rest of my life. I can get out of the 

. woods. sometimes getting new insights by avoiding the inability of not being able to 
see the forest through the trees. 

Surfing is being part of Nature. an involvement with one of her most powerful and 
beautiful elements. Surfing is starring in your own "Man and the Challenge" 
program. Surfing is also fear- that sick feeling you get when you are caught "inside" 
and are forced to dive under that huge wall of crushing whitewater . Questions race 
through your mind : can you make it around the wave? Can you get under it and 
manage to hang onto your board 0 

To its devotees. surfing is more a religion than a sport. It is also a life-style. It 
means going to bed early so you can get out shortly after dawn to avoid the wind and 
crowds that appear as the morning progresses. It means going often. for if you don 't, 
you get out of shape and los(' your sense of timing. It means putting surfing time 
ahead of time for anything else ; you learn to schedule the rest of your activities 
around tide tables and when you know the wind will be coming up. 

When I first moved to California. in late 1963. surfing was tbe fad - anybody who 
was somebody surfed . For girls, as well as guys. it meant bleaching your hair with 
lemon juice I the more " natural " way I or peroxide. picking up on the jargon 
I remember when a real " bummer " used to be a "wipe-out" I, and talking about the 
waves and the beach. Surfing was tbe thing to be associated with . Many fads have 
come and gone since then . such as being an exponent of peace and love, being able to 
get into " heavy" acid rock . using drugs, being angry and defiant towards the 
establishment. et al. 

Surfing is starring in your o";;n"Ma"n and the Challenge" 
p rogram ... 

Fortunately. surfing is no longer the " in " thing to do. I suppose some of the fadism 
remains for cults of blond-haired junior and senior high school kids in coastal 
communities I witness any Saturday or Sunday morning at La Jolla Shores); but, by-
and-large. "urfers are not regarded any special esteem in youth culture. There is, as 
a result. a smaller intlux of new people into the sport- that's fine , for there are 
already too many involved in it. Surfers are chauvinistic. They think of beaches as 
being " their" break. Outsiders. in this area particularly if they're from L.A., are 
looked down upon. if not despised . UCSD surfers, for instance, regard Blacks's as 
their own sacred shrine to worship the surfing god . 

Surfing is an on-going and significant subculture at UCSD. Dripping wet-suil-clad 
enthusiasts are a familiar sight in the dorm elevators at almost any hour. When a 
new swell is picking up. they let on about it to their friends in hushed and reverent 
tones . Many a student has been seen. with a gleam in hi s eye. saying something like , 
" Windansea. the south swell is up" . Many students have come to UCSD las they go 
to CC Santa Barbara I just because of its geography for surfing. as the La Jolla-San 
Diego County area is one the best surfing regions in the state. 

Come what may. in the form of political. social. and educational events, surfing 
will be an important part of the CCSD community and to campus life. UCSD is one 
of the few colleges in the country so uniquely ideal for surfing, and for the 
appreciation of the ocean in all its forms. And for surfers here. as well as 

ever~'where else they exist. surfingness will be next to-godliness.
