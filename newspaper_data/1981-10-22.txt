Overseers: UCSD's gentle giants 
BY TIM PICKWELL 

Staff Writer 

Powerful. but powerless. the C. 0 Board of Overseers 
njoys a unique existence. 
This group of 5 affluent and influential community 

lead rs. including a retired admiral. a sofa king! a \~elfare 
director. minority coalition leaden.; . a towel dls tnbutor. 
lawyers. doctors and the mayor's ex-wife. i' invol ved in 
some of the m st important decis ions that affect the 
university. Yet. despite the economic and political clout of 
the organizations they r present . board members haveno 
official power. 

Th board was formed as an advisory committ in the 
fall of 1973 by former Chancellor William D. McElroy. 
The purpo'e of the council, explain ' Assistant Vi e-
Chancellor David Ern"t. "is to a t as an amba 'sador 

between UC D and the city ." It \\as unique in the l' 
system until I O. when c:= an Fra~cisc() modelled a 
commission after the an DIego organizatIon. 

Other t han restructuring and formalIZIng board 
guidelines, Richard Atkinson ha~ don litt Ie tochange the 
institution during his ~hort tenure as chancellor 

tkinson recognizes the publtc relatlOn~ \'alue of a panel 
of citizen: who name among their ranks chaIrmen and 
presidents of severral industries. three sa\'ing~ and loan ... . 

an Diego Ga ' and Electric. and a an Diego {'nion editor 
ince t hey are not an official part of the U D 

hierarchy, board m mbers act only in a gUIdance apacity . 
In thi ' respect. the body differs from other campus 
organization' throughout the nation.

Letters t o the Editor 

Guardian chastised 
on boycott sta'nd 
Edit or: 

The editorial position of The 
GuardiOlI toward'S the AS 
boycott of the chancellor's 
inaugurat ion (Guardian, Oct. 
19) is a desgraceful admission 
of the paper's total lack of 
concern for or comprehension 
of t he progress of s t udent 
right on this campus. How 
the only commercial news-
paper on campus can make 
any "uncatagorical" state-
ment about w hat is or i . not in 
the -tudent ·' intere -t i ' a 
Quest ion t hat never seems to 
concern its editorial board. 
Once again The Guardian is 
fo teringthe belief that theA 
is solely motivated by self 
aggrandizement. The whole 
purpo 'e of the boycot t is to 
draw attention to the views of 
the A about the chancellor's 
search to make a statement. 
A· a fee-paying student (much 
of which eventu ally gets 
transfered to The Guardiml 
through the large num ber of 
fee supported organizations 
who advert i'e in the twice-
weekly pUblication), [ am 
appalled by thi s blatant 
attempt to trivialize the 
boycott. Undoubted ly. ov rthe 
years people in t he AS have 
been motivated by personal 
gain a~ opposed to a det ached 

~en se ofsludent mterests. Hut

Student requests for 
campus visit at ions by t he final 

candidates, so that a students 
appraisal could be made and 
tudent opinion voiced, were 

repeatedly. denied by UC 
President Saxon. (Because 
'Iudents vigorously objected 
to this policy, the demand (or

Mr. Clayton is nevertheles

4 Thc CSD Guardian ThursdHY, Octobc" 22, 1 n81 

There are inconsistencies in arguments 
Editor: 

I fou nd t he article "The Age 
of Rock ' and the Rock of 
Age ," (Guardian , pt. 27), by 
Nathaniel Wander, to have put 
the creationist viewpoint in a 
distorted light. while 
attributing undue credit to the 
theory vi evolution. The spirit 
and approach was to mock one 
view and as ert the other, 
avoiding an objective 
evaluation of evidence. 
appreciating the reply of Barry 
Clayton, we wish to add the 
following. 

The article brings a false 
charge upon creationists. ]t 
implie they follow a religious 
persuasion in distinction to a 
scientific one. Ah, let us reflect 
on the nature of truth! Does 
not truth on a given 'u bject 
often entwine itself with trut h 
on other subjects? [s not the 
classification of truth into 
various departments all to 
some extent artificial? Truth 
is truth. ]n the discussion at 
hand, there is a necessary and 
vital link between the truths 
relating to Divine creation or 
its lack, and the trut hs 
respecting the manner by 
which mankind come to exist. 

If we deny Creation because 
it is necessarily dependent on a 
conviction of truth respecting 
something we have classified 
as religion - the exi tence of 
an almighty causitive being-
then we have excluded by 
assumption a whole branch of 
potential truth from our scope 
of investigation. 

On the other hand . I do not 
want to foolishly assert a 
'upernatural cause where a 

natural cause is apparent and 
demon s tratabl y sufficient. 

nd here lie ' t he great debate. 
Evolutionist · claim that 
nature by itself is a suitable 
cause. though they have failed 
to provide even one mecha-
nism which can be demos/rated 
competent to generate 
complex man from any state 
beneath man. whether of 
protoplasm or beast. And 
against them stand the laws of 
entropy and probability in 
steadfast array! 

What of creat ion? The 
illustration is time-worn. but 
pertinent. that to find a watch 
of intricate design and 
complexity and int lIigenL 
function reasonable argue ' a 
maker of substantial wisdom 
and capacity. So to find 
mankind of unfathomably 
more intricate and complex 
structure than a watch argues 
in the most reasonable way for 
a creation of eminent 
intelligence and superior kind. 
This is induction of the most 
basic sort . Shall we forbid this 
thought from our public 
schools? Shall we withhold 
from the thinking minds of our 
young the evidence of nature 
consistent with so reasonable 
a proposition? 

Creation science demon-
st rates that reasonable 
evidence of nature. And it 
point out that evolution has 
' erious pitfalls when 
compared to the evidence of 
nature. The question is simply 
this: shall the pyu blic schools 
decree in favor of one view or 
the other of our origins. or 
shall it expose the eviden e for 

"EXTRAORDINARY. 

rach and Irt the decisions of 
such far-r aching concl usions 
rest wit h an informed pupil? 

Dr. Wander states. "The 
fo ' ' il record ... ~how · clrar 
evidence that the ancestral 
lines of apes and humans were 
also separating ... .. But not e 
thi evaluation of the fossil 
evidence from cieuce 
magazine. 

"The very nature of 
paleoanthroPOlo~'Y encourage ' 
divi iveness . The primary 
scientific evidence is a pit ifully 
small array of bones from 
which to construct man's 
evolutionary history . One 
anthropologist has compared 
the task to that of recon ·truct· 
ing the plot of Wal' alld Peace 
wit h 13 randomly selected 
pages." (The Poli tics of 
Paleoanthropology . Science. 
2213, 737-740). 

Dr. Wander state "Dar-
winian theory hinge s 
on ... variat ion ...... and points to 
research in "molecu la r 
genet ics ... protein chemistry 
... speciation of bacteria and of 
fruit flies; data from the 
experimental production of 

~rgani~ comp'0unds from 
morgamc ones to suggest a 
'olid foundation for a 
mechanism of variation from 
one form to another. But the 
fatal flaw urfaces! He has 
cited investigation relating to 
microevoluliou (a concept 
which e ncompasses the 
processes of genetic mutation. 
chromosomal change. random 
drift and natural select ion -
which not even creationists 
dispute). but not a white about 
nlacrO(!I 'O /lItion. which is the 

very heart of the controversy! 
E\(~n tvolut ionary theorists 

(Stebbins and Ayala. ScieHce. 
Vol. 213, pp. 967. 971) show 
that JJ1lcroevolutionary 
proces~e~ can neither be used 
to deri\'c nor be connected to 
macroevolution. which is a 
hypot het ical concept not 
possessing identified pro-
cesses of variation. nor resting 
upon any observat ional or 
experimental evidence. But it 
is precisely this kind of 
evidence and its repeated 
confirmat ion by which theory. 
as Mr. Wander state '. is 
accepted. Thu ' , if true 
scientist" we are. many of us 
have been fooled into aCCel)ting 
not at hcory of macroevolution 
and of life origin, but of dogma 
thereof. 

"Evolution was not an 
established theory, but a 
tentative hypothe ·is." 
(Thoma ' Hllxley) 

Apparently Mr. Wander has 
accepted one at tempt to 
reconcile microevolut ionary 
processe with the hypothesis 
of macroevolution. i.e. , the 
model of pU11cluated equilibria. 
defined by Stebbins and Ayala 
(1981) as "short periods of 
rapid phenotypic change 
followed by long spans or 
morphological stasis..... But 
microevol u t ionary processes 
are shown by Stebbins and 
Ayala to be also consi ·tent 
wit h phyletic gradualism. the 
com pet ing model. What must 
be realized is that the model of 
punct uated equ ilibria has 
"evolved" to explain the 
absence of "missing links" in 
the foss il record which are 

predict d by models of ph ylel ic 
gradualism. 

Having thus misrepresentL'(\ 
(as a theory) hypotheses of 
macroevolution. Dr. Wander 
goes on to misrepres nt 
creationist views and 
purposes a ' well. But we 
maintain that the teaching of 
theory shou ld be dist inguis hed 
from the imaginative 
hypot heses of scientists, while 
not advocati ng the prohibition 
of anything. As it stands. 
(macro)evolution is practica lly 
manda tory training for the 
young impressionable mind ' 
we as educators are shaping. 

Thi s brings u ' to an 
important point. which may 
best be illustrated by a point 
written by the noted 
neurophysiologist ].C. Eccles 
in his monograph "Facing 
Reality ." "Even eminent 
scientist · sometimes err in 
telling people that science is 
giving a fundamental 
underst anding of nature .. .I 
have no object ions to scientists 
expressing these views as long 
as they do not claim to speak 
with the authority of Science, 
which is assumed by the 
public to provide certainties 
which must be accepted 
unreservedly .. .. Science is in 
fact a personal performance of 
scientists. each explaining 
some aspect of nature and 
expressing these explanations 
to ot hers for their critical 
judgment and experimental 
testing... Ibutl it must be 
realized that truth itself can 
never be full y attained lin this 
way I except at a t riviallevel.· ·

Atkinson to be inaugurated today 
By PETER MORTENSEN 
Richard C. Atkinson will be 

inaugurated as the fifth 
chancellor of UCSD this 
morning in ceremonies at the 
Mandeville Center Auditor-
Ium. 

The principal address at 
Atkinson's inauguration will 
be given by UCSD's third 
chancellor. Dr. William 
McGill. An estimated 800 
people are expected to attend 
the ceremonies. including 
·tudents. staff, faculty, 
university administrators and 
regents and members of the 
community. 

In hi s addre" to t he 

audience. Associated Students 
President Jules Bagneris I is 
expected to ca ll for students in 
the audience to walk out of the 
auditorium. Also. by mandate 
of a resolution approved by the 
counci l two weeks ago. 
members of the AS will not 
attend the inauguration. 

The resolution condemned 
UC 'y ·temwide administra-
tion for not allowing sufficient 
student input in the search to 
find a replacement for former 
Chancellor William McElroy 
two years ago. [n particular, 
the resolution ca lled for open 
campu' visits by finali sts for 
the chancellor' hip. 

W ODlan harrassed 
A woman was harra 'sed by 

a man who jumped out from 
behind a tree and exposed 
himself. as she walked from 
Revelle Plaza toward the Bio-
Medical Library at 6:30 p.m. on 
Saturday night. 

Noticing the man had a 
knife. the woman began to run 
aero': t he footbridge over 
Gilman Drive. She stumbled, 
however. and when a pas erby 
ca me to her aide, the woman 
looked back and saw her 
assailant nowhere. 

According to UC police who 
took the anonymou ' report. 
the a ' 'a ilant wa ' described as 
a white. adult male. 
approximately 5'10" with a 
medium body build and short 
dark hair . He \Va : seen 
wearing jeans and po 'sibly a 
denim jacket. 

Anyone who may have :een

Undergraduate cie nce 
Building at about 6:30 p.m. on 
Saturday. Oct. ]7, is urged to 
call UC Police. 

CIA invades AS 
About 20 members of the Revelle College's Community 

Interaction A 'sociation invaded la t nigh t's As 'ociated 
Students Council meeting. demanding that the official be more 
responsive to st udent needs. 

Dressed in battle fatigues and mirrored s unglasses and armed 
with toy pi ·tols. the group's 'pokesman repeatedly demanded 
that the council program more TGIFs. 

The group occupied the meeting for about eight minutes at 
7: l5 p.m .. just as the meeting had moved to student input. 

Council reaction to the intrusion was mixed. AS Commission 
of External Affairs Pam Gerber was reportedly very upset . while 
AS President Jules Bagneris calmly a ked the group to step 
outside where he talked to them privately for about l5 minutes. 

The meeting resumed without further interruption after the 
CIA departed . 

CIA was established earlier thi s quarter as a project of Revelle 
Resident Advisor Matt Xavier. The group is oriented toward 
campus and community service.

Some AS members yester· 
day were passing out cards 
explaining the reasons for the 
boycott and urging the student 
body to join the council in 
refu sing to attend the 
inauguration. 

Last year at a recept ion for 
Atkinson given by UC 
President David Saxon, a 
number of stu dents were 
physically removed from the 
Mande vi ll e Auditorium 
entrance whi le they proteted 
the reform of the chancellor's 
search process. 

No plans for an act ual 
demonstration by t he A 
cou ncilor other students have 
been announced . 

The formal inauguration 
ceremony is just one of many 
activities scheduled thi ' week

AS wants to acquire bookstore 
AS Presidentlules Bagneris 

has proposed a colossal project 
for this year: he would like to 
see the University Bookstore's 
administration turned over 
from the university to the 
students. 

Remembering the long lines 
at the beginning of the 
quarter, many students would 
agree that a change of some 
sort is needed. However, there 
is much more to be taken into 
consideration. 

For this reason. the AS 
unanimously passed a bill to 
allocate $200 to pay a National 
University student to formally 
eval uate the operation, 
management and structure of 
the University Bookstore.

was conducted by CaIP[RG in 
1979. Prompted by student 
angry about the high cost of 
books at UCSD. CalPIRG 
looked into the matter and 
found text books to be marked 
up approximately 20 percent 
from the wholesale cost; 
general books marked up 20 to 
40 percent; and gift items 
marked up as much as 100 
percent. 

Un i versi t y Books tore 
manager Paul Mare discoun· 
ted the CalPIRG investigation 
as sensational and said that 
the markups quoted are 
"standard selling practice." 

Mares explained that the 
bookstore was first institu-
tionalized because there was 
no AS established at the time. 

To start up the bookstore, the 
UC administration borrowed 
money from the regents. Since 
then 5 or 6 more loans have 
been taken out, and the 
bookstore is still paying these 
loans back. with a debt of 
about $175,000 remaining. 

"The Bookstore represents 
debt." said Mares, explaining 
that all money generated goes 
into increasing the inventory 
and is not taken as profit. 

VVhen asked about the 
problems the AS would face if 
they took over the bookstore, 
Mares ' main concern was 
money. He claims that the 
administration could not be 
turned over to students unless 
the AS bought it, which would

ty for the loans. "ASUCSD has 
had a rocky beginning and 
they .Hen't financially

Mares says that he is not

Editor: 
I am quite glad to see that 1 

am not the only one who ha . 
thought about a Greek system 
at UCSD. Talking to a couple 
Phi Delta members. r al 'o 
believe that fraternities and 
sororities (being that I am a 
fema le) would do not hing but 
improve the campus in se\'eral 
wavs. 

Usuall v the more abundant 
~ocia l gatherings have mainly 
consisted of one-college 
part ies. To meet ot hers. from 
all ~ectors of t he school. 
campus integration is our best 
bet. Take for example. Phi 
Delta 's up co ming "all-
campus" event. I really would 
enjoy experiencing t he wide 

range 01 activit ies and opt ions 
that the Greek's wou ld supply. 

At the ·moment. I re 'ide in a 
dorm. but after t his year I do 
not have the slight est idea 
where r will end up. Wit h the 
hou s ing ' hortages near 
campus. and a limited budget 
sit uat ion, frat. and 'orority 
houses would ensure some-
where to live; granted t hey do 
nut get way out of hand. 

I reali~e that the feasibility 
of the Greek tradition is 
dou bt ed by a great deal of the 
student bod\, . This notion 
about poss(ble Greeks in 
UCSD's future is what those 
who are interested make it to 
be ... a snobby turned up nose, 
or a "model system." 

Kim Collier The AS takeover would 
have no bearing on the prices 
of books, in Mares opinion. 
The differing prices seem to 
vary according to the size of 
the school. A larger college, 
such as SDSU is able to offer 
book ' at a lower price becau 'e 
their volume is so much larger 
than UCSD's. 

"I'm not coming to solve a 
problem." Ehigiator said . "I 
am making a study to see 
exactly what is going on. 1 
don't know if the AS can do 
it ... that·s for the AS to decide 
after I finish my report. " Only 
two UC bookJtoresare st udent 
owned and managed. UCLA 
and UCB. Both campuses have 
substa ntially larger AS 
organizations , with the extra 
financial clout accompanying 
the size. Mares said that when 
t he AS at UCLA and UCB 

Bookstore. more student input 
is taken in account when 
stocking, and Groundworks is 
not run as a profit making 
outfit. No taxes are charged 
and they also loan books out. AS boycott 

Bagneris wa hesitant to 
comment on hi' plan ' , 
tre ' 'ing that the AS doe 'n't 

want to "jump into anything." 

Whe t her or not the 
University Bookstore is taken 
over by the AS . the 
admini ·tration will continue 
its plans for expansion from 
19,000 square feet to 21,000 
after remodeling . The 
expansion , which stems from 
the pressure for more medical 
and research book '. will cost 
approximately $73.000.

points out pecial Assistant to 
the Chanr:ellor Bruce Darling. 
"between the UCSD Board of 
Overseer ' and group ' li ke the 
Harvard Board of upervi ors 
and the UC Regents . The 
Board function ' as a group ' of 
citizen ' interested in the 
community. They repre 'ent a 
broad portion of the population 
and provide VCSD with 
community reaction. " 

The organization, however. 
is more t han a glori fied 
sounding-board for ideas. 
De 'pite their lack of formal 
muscle. secretary to the Board 
Ernst feels that the Overseers 
do wield considerable power. 

"The Chancellor would be 
in a difficult position." he 
says, "if he attempted to go 
against the wishes of the 
Board." 

The directorate has :nade its 
wishes known on several 
occasions. It was instrumental 
in co nvinci ng the s tate 
legislature when the universi-
ty wished to expand Third 
College. The group al so 
lobbied against the budget-
slashing Proposition 9 on 
behalf of UCSD . The 
Overseers were also the 
deciding factor when the 
university wanted to establish 
a local nature habitat. "The 
UC Regents decided to 
pre 'erve t he knoll area above 
Black's Beach when they felt 
the commu nity support." 
Earnst says. 

Recent ly the committee 
contributed to the decision to 
develop La Jolla Farms Stables 
on Nort h Torrey Pines Koad . 
"The Board offered several 
recommendation ' when the 
Univers ity was co nsidering 
options." Darling says.

issue comes up once a year in 
which th executives play a 
major role. Most of the time 
during the board's four annual 
meeting ' is 'pend reviewing 
budgets. long-range plans and 
the impact of universi ty 
project · on the lo c al 
community. 

During the most recent 
sess ion. last Wednesday, the 
35 mem bers in attendance 
Ii ·tcned to the Dean of 

niversit y Extension . Dr. 
Mary Wal shok. After 
r e\' iewing the program 's 
hi story, she out lined some 
goals and descri bed their 
impact on the community. 
Wal s huk di sc us ' ed the 
courses offered by the school 
and dealt with t he enrollment 
target s of the 40,OOO'person 
program. 

She assured concerned 
board mem bers that UCSD 's 
extension program would not 
compete with area junior 
colleges. 

Wal shok, along with 
Atkinson, expressed the belief 
that local businesses would 
find it easier to recruit quality 
technical people if UCSD could 
offer continuing education. 

A pitch was also made to 
board mem bers asking for help 
in developing opport unities for 
business and technical 
progam ' involving foreign 
conferences. 

Several executives offered 
suggest ions about the nat ure 
of courses and ideas about 
qualified in s tructor s in 
business related classes. 

The early part of thi s 
meeting was focused around 
UC ' D's $352 million annual 
budget. The panel listened 
a ttentively as adm inist rator 
V. Wayne Kennedy reminded 
the board of the economic 
impact of the school's 11 .SOD

The leaders also learned 
what effect the impending two 
percent state budget cut would 
have on the UC system. They 
discussed the pros and cons of 
raising s t udent fees, and the 
overcrowding of athletic 
facilities . 

More mundane issues like 
the Univers it y Hospita l 
parking problem received less 
attention. 

The Overseers meet for t\\'o 
hours every three mont hs. 
Mem bers receive information

about pertinent uni versi -

Each board mem ber serves a

Twenty new-comers joined 
the Overseers this year.

But UCSD is some~ hat

an important linkage bet wee n

he said. 

"San Diego has grown 
incredibly in my lifetime. and, 
with Tijuana across the 
border, and an ever-increasing 
population ourselves, we have 
ahead of us some of the most 
interesting challenges in the

One of the more interesting

was unable to attend the

Geisel as the creator of 
Grinches and Whoville; his 
pen name is Dr. Suess. 

Says Ernst. who has been 
the executive secretary since 
the Chancellor formed the 
Board eight years ago. "This i ' 
the best legacy McElroy left to 
the University." 

The unique business 
positions of many of the 
members, coupled with their 
intimate knowledge of UCSD, 
raises the spectre of fi scal

'Body_ Shoppe' at

Not hardly - but t h re are 

:17 Peer IlealL h Advocates 
ready and wi lling to serve you 
at "The Body Shoppe," 
lie -D's new outlet for 
preventative health care 
sen' ice. 

"The Body Shoppc" is a ne\\ 
addit ion to t he Student Il ealt h 
Center which will help 
s tudents "take care of their 
bodies," says Health 
Education Specialist Susan 
Daniels, who helped s pear· 
head the project. And the Peer 
Health Advocates are st udent 
volunteers, w ho are, in terms 
of their motto, "specializing in 
UCSD students." Together, 
they hope to provide the ~CSD 
campus with a more efftclent 
health education program. 

"The Body Shoppe" boas ts 
of several preventative "tune· 
ups, " one being the succe 'sful 
"Self-Help Cold Clinic" which 
was introduced last year with 
great success. 

"We had a really good 
response to the cold clinic," 
said Daniel ' of the approxi· 
mated 325 people who took 
advantage of the unique 
program. "That 's 325 less 
going through fir st aid," she 
commented_ 

The "Cold Clinic" i · now 
located in a special cubicle in 
the waiting room of the 
Student Healt h Center. It is "a 
wa lk-t hrough , elf-screening 
area supervi 'ed by a Peer 
Health Advocate," which 

provide,- studellt ... with 
general in format ion regllrdi ng 
cold symptoms and treat -
men t s . F 0 I I () \\' i n g the 
screening, t he Peer Ilea It h 
Advocate can procc('d 10 aid 
the patient in Ihe selecllon of 
non-prescript ion n1('dicmion. 

Thus, t he object iw's of the 
Cold Clinic became, "to reduce 
the number of 'minor' colds 
which come through the First 
Aid Clinic, reduce the number 
of unnecessary re-v isits to the 
Student Health _ ervice for 
minor colds, and to increase 
the number of students with 
severe colds to seek prompt 
medical attention." 

Among other preven tative 
clinics which " The Body 
Shoppc" offers are a blood 
pressure check and informa-
tion center, and a self-care 
derm clinic_ The new center 
a lso boasts of its own health 
resource library which 
contains several medical books 
and manuals for student 
information and education 
concerning various ai lment: 
and health care. 

"There is no real unified 
source of health information," 
stated Daniels. The health 
interest group was bu'y 
locat ing sources of informa· 
tion this summer and was 
lucky enough to net several 
comp lementary medical 
books, magazines and other 
brochures which helped form 
their library.

Acid precipitation: ne", tneaning for rainy days 

BY NANCY SAMUELSON 
In the 19th century, Mark Twain's quip 

"Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does 
anyt hing about it" was a harmless joke. 
Unfortunately, in our time the joke has taken on a 
more serious meaning. 

Acid rain is the popular term given to a variety of 
acid precipation that can include rain , snow, fog. 
and even something called "dry precipitation." It is 
an increasingly ",idespread problem , occurring 
wherever at mospheric currents carry t he acid· 
forming pollutants . The problem has drawn 
internat ional allent ion, and governments are 
spending millions of dollars to answer questions 
about acid rain: what ca uses it, what will be its 
effects in the year ' to come. and what can be done to 
control it? 

Acid rain is a result of industrialization. Its 
principal cause is the burning of coal and fuel oils, a 
process which releases oxides of su lfur and nitrogen 
into the atmosphere. These oxides can react with 
water to form acids. which then fall to the earth as 
different types of acid precip itation. Dry 
precipitation occurs when sulfur emissions are 
deposited and dissolve directly on the earth. This 
type of pollution is generally found close to the 
emission source. : 

Acid rain has greatly increased in the latter part of' 
this century, due to the increased use of fossil fuels . . 
The oxides of sulfur and nitrogen come from 
different sources. ~ 

Sixty·five percent of the oxides of sulft!r released 
into the atmosphere, are produced by electric power 

utilities, twenty·five percent comes from ot her 
indus~rial sources. The source of fort y·fi ve percent 
of the oxides of nitrogen is the internal combustIOn 
engine. which is well·known for this form of 
pollution . The elect ric utilities produce t wenty·eight 
percent of the oxides of nitrogen. 

The contribution of coal·burning power plants to 
th far ranging spread of acid rain is in part an ironic 
result of attempts to comply with local pollutIOn 
regulations of recent years. To reduce the 
concentration of su lfur and nitrogen oxides near the 
ground . companies built super·tall smoke~tacks. 
These send the pollutants high into the atmosphere. 
to be carried far away by the winds. The pollutants 
eventually return to theearth . sometimes hundreds 
of miles from their source. What was a local or 
regional problem becomes international. 

The winds that spread acid rain generally move to 
the northeast. Acidification of Scandinavian lakes 
and rivers is related to the industrial output of 
England, and some estimate that up to fifty percent 
of Canada's acid rain comes from the United State. 
However, Canada sends some back and the degree of 
responsibility of any country is difficult to 
determine. 

The overall effect of acid precipitation on a locale 
will range from slight to drastic, depending on the 
composition of the environment. Mountainous areas 
with hard, granite·type bedrocks, thin topsoils and 
extensive fresh water 'ecosystems (areas such as . 
Scandinavia, ' north ·eastern United States and 
Canada) are the most susceptible to acid damage. 
Wh y is this kind of topography affected more than 

others? The an!>wer lies partly in the nature of acids. 
Acids are reactive. An acid can be de~cribed 

chemically as a solution that contains a source of 
hydrogen Ions. An ion is a charged atom. Strong 
acid!-> have a high concentration of hydrogen IOns; 
thus they will react with man) substances. 

The OXides of sulfur and nitrogen that areemltted 
into the atmosphere react \ ... Ith \\ ater. to form 
su lfuric and OItric aCids. These are strong and. and

correspond· to high acidity. Di tilled \vater ha ... a pH 
of 7, which is neutral, indicatmg a balanced amount 
of hydrogen ion '. .. atural" unpolluted ram will 
have a pH ranging from about 5.6 to 7. The rain 
falling on much of Canada . the northeastern United 
States and western Europe has an average pH well 
below 5. The pH scale is logarithmic which means 
that rain with a pH of 4 will be ten times more acidic 
than one measuring pH 5. and 1.000 times more 
acidic than neutral water with a pH of 7. 

Acids are at one end of the pH scale. At the other 
end are bases, or alkalines. Acids and bases tend to 
neutralize each other. This has important effects 
environmentally, If an acid rain falls on an alkaline 
soil, the acid will be neutralized. which lessen the 
acid's directly damaging effects, although the 

intera~ion of the acid with the soil can produce 
potentially harmful changes, In absorbing the 
hydrogen ions, the soil must give up other ions in

Ethanol: an alternative fuel 
BY LARRY LEWIS 

The answer to the energy crisis could be in your 
fruit bowl. Until the 1973 Arab oil embargo there 
didn't seem to be an energy shortage. In reality we 
never had an energy shortage but at times we have 
had and do have a short age of avail a ble usable 
energy. According to the first law of 
thermodynamics energy can neit h r be created nol 
destroyed but only changed in form . This change of 
energy is evident in the engine!-- of automobiles. The 
energy in gasoline is converted by the engine into 
heat and mechanical energy, 

As fossil fuels become scarcer and more cosI ly to 
extract, we, as energy consumers. must begin 
experimenting with alternate forms of energy for 
the future , There are many forms of fuels which can 
be substituted for gasoline. Methane derived from 
cow manure is an adequate subst it ute. It is unlikely 
that we cou ld ever produce enough met hane from 
cow manure to even begin to sat isfy our nel'<is. Ethyl 
alcoholorethanol is anot her alt ernat ive f lIel which 
can be Substi tuted for gasoline. Ethanol is a 

colorless. flammable liquid. which is obtained from 
the fermentation of sugars and starches. Itl s used as 
a solvent, in drugs and in alcoholic beverages. In the 
United States during prohibi tion and t he depression 
alcohol was substituted for gasoline in automobiles 
by bootleggers and poor country people. [n Cerill any 
during World War II alcohol as well as ot her IllOl'e 
complex synthetic fuels were substituted 1.,1' 
gasoline, which was in short su ppl y. Today in t hl' 
US, one part ethenol is being combined \vith IlrIlL' 
parts ga 'oline in a mixture called gasahol. [n Bl'al ll 
people are successfully operating et hanoi buriling 
cars on a fairly large scale. 

[n the United States there have I~l'n le\\ 
concl usive studies regarding th effect of ma"'!'> 
alcohol production but many indicators poinl ttl it~ 
fea sibi lity . 

Bet ween October 17 and October 24 the Fut lire 
Fuels Challenge Rall y will rake place. The \'ehicles 
in thi ' rally from Los Angeles to Rochester, Ne\\' 
York are all powered by non· fossil fuels. There sill be 
steam cars, solar electric cars and elect ric ·alcohol 

hybrid ', as well as vehicles burnmg methanol. 
butanol and ethanol. There will even be a hydrogen 
modified diesel which burns 'alad OIl. The rail, \\ 111 
attempt to prove that the US has the technoh;g~ to 
take care of our own energy problems and I hat no 
ot her cou ntry holds the key to our enerf.,l'y fulure. 

The method of making ethanol can range from a 
fairly 'imple process used by some boot leggers to 
more sophisticated and complex processes u..,ed in 
re 'earch laboratone~. To begm with. frUit or plants 
are mixed with ferment ing enzymes :-<uch as 
brewers yeas t and allowed to ferment. After the 
vegetable'matter has fermented , heat i appl1ed to 
the mash. The heat causes the alcohol molecule.., to 
evaporate (ethanol boils at 7 C. or 160 F.l. The 
vaporized alcohol is run through a conden~er and if 
it is of su fficient potency can be used in place of 
gasoline in an internal combustion engine. In order 
for a car to operate properly on et hanoi !-'ome 
modifications must be made. A few of the 
modifications include replacemen t of all ru bber fuel

gasoline is accompanied by a not iceable loss in 
power. There is also a drop in mileage when ui si ng

can be offset by installing a high compress ion piston 
in the engine. The high compression pistons take

Everything you e ver wanted

New book goes overboard in praise of superstar 
Sonl?aud Dance Man : The 
Art of Bob Dylan 
By Michael lirey 
SL Martin's Press 

BY TED BURKE 
I like reading a well·written 

piece of rock criti ism as much 
as any ot her guy or gal 
however obsessed with such 
things, but there is a point of 
overkill in all things one 
enjoys. [n the case of th~ afar-
mentioned genre, MIchael 
Grey's hyperbolic study, Song 
and Dance Man: The Arl of Bob 
Dylan, should be given a 
ci tat ion for overst at emen t. 

Indeed, if we take Grey 's 
assessment at face value, 
Dylan would be seen as one of 
the Great Masters , someone to 
mention alongside the likes of 
Da Vinci, Beethoven , Cage and 
Eliot , and a host of an y others 
one may wish to add to the 
honor ed s trin g. Grey's 
int ent ion is t o make a 
convincing case for Dylan as 
an artist worthy of study , an 
endeavor as worthy a any 
other, but in his f v r to gi ve 
his adm it redl y unique insights 
into Ihe songwriter's bod y of 
work, Grey becomes seduced 
bv his own enthusiasm and 
inadvertantl y becomes hois t ed 
by hi s own pet ard by making 
clai ms that he's hardl y able to 
substanti ate.

This port ion of t he text 
makes for fascinating and 
illuminating reading as Grey, 
sounding at limes like the 
proverbial whiz· kid with the 
la ·t word on any su bject he 
might broach, miraculously 
integrates Dylan 's seemingly 
crazy·quilt career, being able, 
in a good teacher's enthused 
ease , to align him with 
potentially embarra ss ing 
comparisons without once 
'ounding a' though he were 
straining for effect. As a 
serious, critical assessment of 
Dylan's work , the firs t two 
thirds stand as an admirable 
accomplishment that might 
serve as a model of high-
minded criti cism to come. 

books 
The last third, though , falls 

apart when Grey loses his 
critical distance and becomes 
victim of the pratfall s of 
abject , unembarrassed hero· 
wors hip. So far as I was

'Prince of the City' tells it like 
it isn't in life of street cops 

BY JAY MARTINEZ 
T here's a breakfast scene in 

Prince 0/ the City in w hich a 
detective and his wife. feedi ng 
the baby, discuss hi: deci sion 
to become an informer for an 
internal affairs investigator. 
She savs, "You 've alwavs said 
lhe worst thing to be was a ..... 

nel he responds by looking at 
her, cocking his h ad a litle, 
and chokes out. "You 
mean ... Raf?' · 

The word is weightless 
compared to the s trea m of 
hard nose s lang which had 
been used to establish the 
beh ind-t he-scenes roughness 
of the movie . The feelingofthe 
s tory jolts from the sq u areness 
of the word into predicament: 
if thi ' word is so strong as to 
cause indige ·tion in cops , 
what sort of stuff are they 
made of? 

Apparently just hearts of 
gold. Beyond the crit ical 
exploitat ion of the factual

basis of t he tory (which seems 
to be bent at qUite some angle), 
and beyond a reliance of 
notoriety of being accepted for 
archival and lraining purposes 
of the Justice Department, 
Prince i ' a I ve affair with 
cops. 

What happens is that Lumet 
t urns a bunch of hoods into 
larni shed angels of juslice. As 
in Serpico, Lumet 's earlier 
requiem for the shining police 
officer. Prine 's Ciello 
confesses, "All r wanted to be 
was a good cop." r ndefen 'i ble 
against vice, circumstance 
pushes lega l thugs into a 
cheeky brot her hood on the

a very American way of life. 
society mu ·t as 'ert it · 
enforcement of conformity and 
a s tay· in-Iine oppression. "We 
ar theonlYlhingbetweenyou 
and the jungle," rant s 
D tective Danny Ciello, Treat 
Wi lIiams, at a federal attorney 
intent on cleaning up a dirty 
police department. 

Lumet constructs hi s 
guardians of democracy as 
best ·dres se d hunks of 
unflinching commaraderie 
who cling and caress each 
other ju s t to rea ss ure 
themselves they still have a 
chance in t he wild. Ciello's 
buddies operate as an 
autonomous team of s pecial 
detectives but survive only if 
they sit knee to knee, talk in 
each other's ear, eat. cry and 
hang on the nearest shoulder. 
Th y huddle in conversat ion 

Treat Williams and Lindsay Cro use in Prince uf 'he Ci~\' 

and as the camera glides lower 
and closer. they creak fon ard 
- on edge for each \vord of 
their partner - keeping the 
camera at bay, the s lory 
between their feet, and their 
wives as outs iders to the top or 
side of the screen. 

Any break in the group 
lhreatens it<; integrity and the 
di 'c iple: act for the movie 
most easily when they're 
packed like bull s butted 
together in a defensive circle. 
Treat Williams. who eventual-
ly blows the horn on the 
brethren , lets his hairstyle and 
'mile carry his part. Aloneand 
forced to move the Slory. he

wound·up Rod ney Danger-
field . He bounces and skitters 
across the screen and s pews 
lines with a throaty. rolling 
hysteria . The only coo lness is 
collective and the conformity 
must be protected. 

When thi& conformity is 
broken the members fl y off in 
all directions of unrestrained 
individual doom : uicide, 
sweating alcoholism, or a 
s narling 'u ' picion of a 
partner. The cause. spilling 
one's guts, is cast igated by yet 
another group of three-piece 
woolen rationale. Lawyers ' it 
as a collective protectorate of 
'ociety deciding pennance in 
dark ' uits, large chairs and 
hand ·at-the-chin articulation. 

The federal agents which 
protect Detective Ciello and 

hIS fam!l\ from another sort of 
justice stand out like the word 
'rat '; they are obt usely 
government in overcoats and 
hats giving the film a comic 
touch which the slriped prison 
uniform on Gene Hackman in 

uperman achieved. 
As if afraid to let an 

audience see what fun vice can 
be, Lumet doesn't let his movie 
slray into a proposition that 
deceit might wort h some pIe 
on the face. Ins tead h crams 
the places the good guys 
should have staved with fat 
normalcy: barbeques , ping· 
pong wit h the kids and going to 
lhe mO'vie ·. 

The my ·tery of the French 
Connection heroin rip· off hit 
t he audience as bait but 
wiggles in and out of the 
dialogue like a red herring 
which Lumet doesn't know 
how to grasp for story telling 
exploitat io n . 

Lumet 's movie hinges on a 
black sheep sympat hy which 
might save society precipi -
tously in danger of anarchy. 
Ciello pleads for the flock 
while in despair over the deat h 
of a detecti ve. bouncing in a 
car sc re ami ng , "We're 
different. we've got to be 
treated different ." Hi s 
su rvival code : heads toget her. 
don't glow, go s low . and trust 
me.

mpha ' izing the pitiful side of 
Merrick' · life while bringing 
out the less harsh and more 
personable side. The action is 
tight ly paced, adding energy to 
an already burs ling play . 

Douglas Jacobs, as Treve ', 
clearly embodie ' t h frustra-
tion fe lt by his chara ter for a 
life inexplicable, being often 
subtle and sometime ' bold in 
his delivery. 

Merrick is played by t he 
gi fted young man , Thom 
Murray. whose performance i . 
made stunn ing and en tertain· 
ing throug h his fine 
understandi ng and prepara-
tion for t he part. Murray 

shows us the Inner beauty 
which fought to escape from 
Merrick' s deformed figure . 
Murray is discomforting to 
watch as he trans form s, 
without the aid of make-up, 
into the living image of 
Merrick, the Elephant Man. 

D'a n n Paton Peace is 
charming and daring as Mrs. 
Kenda l, and Bill Dunnam is 
·t riking as Merrick " freak · 

s how manager/ barker. Bothof 
these t alented performers add 
a great deal to t he production. 

Ric Barr. Susan Sh pard, 
Will iam Quiett, and Mickey 
Mullany all help to make the 
production memorable. 

Assisting v ryon is c lIist 

Thomas Schonberg, who 
highlight s the action with 
heavy nOled solos from the 
corner of the st age. 

The set is designed by 
Robert Green; raked and 
cornered by pillars. and lit by 
Willa Mann Day , the stage 
easily captures the melancho-
ly mood which permeales 
through the entire play. 

All in all , this is a fine 
product ion of Pomerance's 
The Elephant Man. and 
certai nly is a must to see.

Costello, just for t he sake of 
the argument , is the finest 
talent to emerge from the 
anything-goes swamp of New 
Wave. a rocker who. though 
defmed by the tradit ion of pop 
music. has managed to 
tran scend hi s varigated 
influences and. (to bring his 
ubiquitou:, name up again) in 
Pound's aphorism. managed to 
"mak it new." someone like 
Dylan in his salad da ys w ho 
has soaked in the music 
around him and has been. 
blessed he be of skill , able to 
come up with a music that 's 
unlike any other that's been 
hea rd . Grey refuses to 
acknowledge the importance 
of Costello's talent , though. 
and comes off sounding like a 
jealous stage moth r when 
co nfro nt ed wit h anot he r 
ta lent capable of doing things 
that his pet project (and object

1M Football 

Every year. the guys who get 
paid to ballyhoo college football sit 
around in a dark room in Fargo. 
North Dakota and think up ways 
to publicize their sport. They take 
a look at all of the college 
superstars, find out who's coming 
back, and then look for an angleto 
trump up a story about. And these 
guys that write are good, too. 1978 
was the Year of the Nose Guard. 
1979 was the Year of the 
Weakside Tackle, and 1980 was-
horrors - the Year of the 
Junkyard Dog 0 (y'know Hushel 
Walker and all that stuff). 

Well, thi ' year folks, they've 
really outdone themselve '_ They 
came up with a real, honest-to-
goodness, All-American beauty. 
Tl,e Year of the Quarterback. Can 
you believe it! So original. And so 

on Iv weakness is that he likes to run up the score. Last week Chocolate Ci t Y blit ~ed th e' Bea\'er~ 68-0 in the highest scoring Men';, ga me in a decade. Nobody has seen 
the Bea\'ers since. poor guys. 

cott Berndes (York Hunt Cluh) .. _not one of your quicker QBs, Scoota a~ he 
IS affectionately kn ow. runs the 10 in 8.9 ... but he gets the job done. His sofl. but 
alway '-on-the-money passes are sometimes hard to handlc. Ju st ask George 
McEldowney who dropped 5 of them last week to shatter Jay RUlherdale\ YHC 
team record. 
Calvin olomon (Aweso01e) ... one of the more confident quarterbacks around. 
Cal likes to sling it with the best of them. He throws deep bet ter than most. and 
talks better than all of them put together. How awesome his team is will be decided 
when they clash with the Harambe Warriors. 
Mike Wagner (Stich 'Em) ... thisguy might make a good doctor,CUz noonecan 

dissect a defense better ... throws the short. well-t i med patterns to perfect ion .. . had 
his Cut 'n run club in the AAA finals la ·t year only to lose to perennial champion 
Raw Meat in the Animal Bowl. Yes, Mike. they're back again this year. 
The AA and A Guys 
.. . no doubt about it. the QB 's in AA and A are just as talented. The only difference 
being perhaps, the lack of a good receh'er or blocker here and there. Here's the 
runriown on some of I he best:

New Bob Dylan book 
continued {rom page 18 
dropped it years ago. Grey 
instead congratulates Co!> tello 
for having picked up the knack 
for "tricky rhymes." 

The short hrift that 
Costello is ac co rded is 
aggravating enough . but Grey 
continue ' in this vein by 
giving similar head-patting 
dismals to other recent 
wort hie like David Byrne 
(Talking Heads), teely Dan. 
T om Verlaine and Ma rk 
Knopfler (Dire Strait!.). Grey's 
rationale is at least consi ·tent: 
these and other art is t · have 
produced . he admits. good 
songs and are "strong art ists." 
but , ala.', Dylan was there 
first. and in 'Grey's anal ys is. 
the conclus ion is inev itable 
and immut able. like a Biblical 
decree - thou shalt have no 
god before me. 

To be fair . Grey doe' an 
impress ive job of tracing 
Dylan 's long road to the born-

again st ance of SloU' Tra in 
Co ming and Sa ved b y 
dis ecting a number of songs 
throughout his career who!>e 
themes echo the concern ~ of 
the Judeo·Chri ·tian ethic and 
makes a co~ent case a . to why 
the 'ong wrIter 's 'pintual 
convers ion wa inevi table if 
not expected . Yet in the end 
Grey nearl y defeat the 
purpose of what thIS book wa,> 
supposed to be: an unspari ng. 
detailed study of Dylan's art, 
free of the my t hologiztng 
banter that 's made most of the 
pre\'iou ' writing on Dylan 
exa pera ttng exercise:- In 
muddled reason. 

SOl/gaud Dallce .Hall ha~ Its 
merit ·, but it stands as an 
ult imately unsat i~fyi ng book. 
sounding too clo'e to being a 
learned love letter in which all 
dis tance and rea on are lost in 
the writer 's compulsion to 
pluck the pet als and cou nt the 
ways.
