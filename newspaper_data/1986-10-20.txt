NASA shuttle to 
orbit with project 
By JAMES GILMORE 

W HE NASA's space shuules begin orbiting the eanh again, one of them may be carrying an experiment designed and built by engineering students at UCSD 
and SDSU. 

The members of the student chapters of the American Intitute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIM) havejoined forces to develop 
an experiment which will measure and analyze the high frequency 
fluctuations in the sun's brightness. 

UCSD senior engineering student and project manager, Norbert 
Carte, said he plans to get the project completed and shipped to 
Kennedy Spa e Center in Rorida by 1989. The students recently 
launched a campaign to raise the $35,000 needed to build and fly 
the experiment , and Carte is optimistic about getting the needed 
support. 

The San Diego section of the AlAA recommended the idea of 
doing an experiment to the student chapters at SDSU and UCSD. 
"The experiment is Dr. Hugh Hudson's idea; he's been thinking 
about it for a while but decided to let us have a crack at it," said 
Carte. Hudson is a research physicist at UCSD's Center for 
Astrophysics and Space Sciences and science advisor to the 
student project. 

The UCSD/ SDSU experiment is relatively simple, according to 
Hudson. The sensor, the he an of the experiment, is a photodiode. 
This semi-conductor device will detect and measure the sun's 
radiant energy by converting it into electric currents. These 
currents can be measured by a type of volt-meter and fed into an 
analog-co-digital convener for storage on computer tape. The data 
will be analyzed when the shuttle returns to earth . 

To get their experiment into space, the students plan to take 
advantage of NASA's "Get Away SpeCIal" (GAS) program , which 
allows for small , self-contall'\ed payloads co be flown on shuttle 
orbiters ata relatively low cost. The students have already reserved a 
spot in line for a GAS flight with ~ $500 deposit last spring. T~e cost 
of NASA's launch service is $10,000. 

The experiments are carried in can isters which are mounted in 
the shuttle's cargo bay on a space available basis. The UCSD/ SDSU 
canister \vill be mounted on a bridge traversing the cargo bay to give 
the device an unobstructed angle on the sun . 

"It 's an excellent way of getting quick and easy access to space, 
and it's available co research scientists as well as students," said 
Hudson. 

"This is a wonderful opponunity for students because a lot of 
future research will be conducted in space," said Ron Angione, 
SDSU professor of aStronomy. Angione, Associate Director of the 
Mount Laguna Observatory, is also consulting on the student 
project. 

Design work on the detector began during the summer and the 
students are going through "proof of concept" now. The experiment 
is going to be tested from the ground soon to check out the 
electronics and see what kind of data is obtained, said Carte. 

"Instead of just reading about what others are doing in space, 
these students are actuaUy doing a project of their own. It's very 
exciting," Angione said , m:I

Centers "raise consciousness" about rape 
By CHERYL CARlWRlGHT 
"There: is no difference between 
being raped 
and going head first through a 
windshield . 
except that afterward you are afraid 
not of ca~ 
but of half the human race," 

Marge Piercy, Living in the Open 

A LTHOUGH the Califo rnia Sexual Assault Awareness Week has passed 
(October 5 through 11 ), the 
UCSD Women's Resource Center 
has designated this week Rape 
Awareness Week for conscious-
raising and the prevention of 
rape. Tonight from 4 pm to 6 

SDSU Women's Resource Center, 
explamed. "We will go to some 
of the areas which we consider 
particularly dark and purposely 
go by places where there have 
been reported rapes," she added. 

A 22-minute color film , shown 
continuously from I pm to ) pm 
on Thursday in the North 
Conference Room , will explore 
"the scope and significance of a 
growing national problem, 
emphasizi ng the effects of rape 
on its victims, and exploding the 
myth that rape is a sexual 
matter ... including an 
informative historical and social 
analysiS of rape and 
commercialized culture ," 
according to the description. 

"Because the UCSD population 
changes every year, there is an 
ongoing problem of education 

and students knowing who the 
UCSD police are ," Roben L. 
Jones, S~rgeant of UCSD's 
Detective Bureau said . 

"We don't have the 
mechanisms or fund s to notify 
every student of a rape ," he 
added . To get information into 
the community as soon as 
possible, in October 1982, the 
UCSD police department 
initiated the Untversity 
Community Alert to inform 
cenain offices on campus and 
leave dissemination up to key 
people as coUege deans, resident 
deans . UCSD's Rape Prevention 
and Education Program (RPEP), 
the Guardian . 

Over the past 12 years, UCSD 
has had 12 reported rapes wi th a 
"smattering" of se xual assaults 
(wi th actual contact) between the 

assailant and the victim. For 
example, three or four years ago, 
a man would go into the 
dormitOries to a female's room, 
run his hand up and down her 
thigh until she woke up and 
then would leave , according to 
Jones "Although the raw 
numbers of reported mcidents 
look very good in relation t6 
other colleges, women should not 
develop a false sense of security," 
Jones added. 

"I think that it is pathetic that 
we have to have a week to raise 
consciousness about rape. There 
are no weeks to raise 
consciousness about murder," 
said Mary Virga, coordinator of 
RPEP. RPEP serves to educate 
1V0men and men in order to 
prevent and reduce the 
incidence of rape. RPEP hopes to 

form a Men Against Rape group 
as men are involved in the rape 
issue because they do the raping. 
Even If pamcular men do not 
commit rape , someone they love 
may be raped - a girlfriend , 
sister. mother. and then the 
reality of rape hits home with 
men, Virga added. 

Women can learn different 
options such as self-defense, but 
that they are unable to use all or 
any of these options, women are 
made to feel guilty. "Rape is the 
only crime where the vic tim is 
the one on the stand. Society 
PUtS the guilt trip on the victim, 
especially with date and 
acquaintance rape . With 
traditional roles. women are 
taught to be submissive, and 
men have been brought up to

Scott Abbey with 13 years 
experience in the martial arts, 
will conduct a self-defense 
workshop emphasizing 
preventive technique and the 
use of the environmem and 
personal effects as handy 
weapons . 

Tomorrow night at 7 pm, a 
"Take Back the Night" rally and 
march will be held at San Diego 
State University's Aztec Center to 
reinforce "women's right and 
freedom to walk safely at night." 
Five rapes have been reported at 
SDSU since school started there 
September 2: one attempted, two 
involving fraternities , and two in 
the past week. "Our march is 
intended to be non-
confrontational , and we will hold 
a silent vigil through the area of 
the concerned fraternities ," 

Student fees to escalate in '87 

Robin Parke, a coordinator at the 

By LINDA BAGINSKI 

U C students may see the end of the twO year registration fee freeze this 
year if the 1987-88 budget 
proposal, including a 9.1 percent 
registration fee increase, is 
approved next month by the 
Regents and later approved by 
the state legislature. 

It is expected in the $5 billion 
budget that this' adjustment, 
creating approXimately $16.1 

million , coupled with a 6.5 
percent state fund increase, will 
create a total close to $140 
rniUion in new revenue. 

UCSD undergraduates would 
see an annual registration fee 
increase of $144 on the average, 
totaling annually to $1 ,674. 

Non-resident fees will be 
elevated 5 percent to $4 ,290 per 
student. 

UC President David Gardener 

said thts budget proposes to 
maintain faculty salaries at a 
competitive level and to conti nue 
a program of construction and 
renovation of facilities. 

·We must not lose our 
momentum in these twO critical 
areas: Gardener said last month 
to the finance committee. "In the

retirements and enrollment

The eternal night of the rapist 
Rape is so many things: it is the epitomy of a neurotic, selfish 

violence; it is a cankerous outgrowth of a civilization gone awry; it is a 
hateful passion for the darker side of power; it is the submission to the 
most despicable norms of our world. The condoning of the act of rape 
- where one silently applauds the pillaging of a woman's, and 
sometimes a man's, dignity, or vocally admonishes those who raise an 
outcry for not accepting the woman's "role" as one who should always 
be submissive - continues to be one of the most appalling and insolent 
manifestations of a consciousless modem world. 

What do we know about rape as individuals, and how can we present 
its terroristic attributes from infecting our immediate surroundings? Can 
we, for example, stop a friend from forcing an intoxicated woman into 
an undesired act of intercourse without seriously questioning our desire 
to make others feel powerless? Is it within our ways of communicating 
with others that open the doors for one of our peers. to , "nail the bitch?" 

The answers to these questions, and they are affirmative, do not come 
easily to the person involved in a real rape scenario. For to know about 
the peril of rape does not necessitate that we feel its potential when it 
lurks around you. Women feel the potential scourge of rape daily, as 
this society has done little to cure the basis of a rapist'S ills. Just 
knowing that there is an electric chair waiting at the end of his dark 
tunnel does not mean that the rapist will forgo his desire to explOit, o~ 
to maim or kill. Most rapists do not reason about life imprisonment or 
death, but only feel the power of unconditional dominance ovenake 
them. 

That desire for total domination over another most frequently takes 
the form of masogyny (the hatred of women). If we do hope to wash 
society clean of the rapist, then we must create those conditions where 
the rapist's mentality is sure to diminish. What this entails is, first , 
taking account of ourselves, of our peer groups, of our families, and of 
our communities. In your search, you will be likely to find many 
instances of patriarchy and of rigid hierarchy which suffocate the 
potential rapist'S chance of growing horizontally. Our society, along with 

many others, is a venical one, with one person always in a seemingly 
dominant position over the other. The competitive male animal despises 
being "looked down upon" by other men, and hates even worse the 
ridicule of those women who our society has "bought-off." When a man 
is forced to submit impotently on the job by a potent male boss, he will 
likely return home and attempt to ponray his potency to the nearest 
woman in Sight. 

It is women toward whom men look for final approval of their potent 
legitimacy. If a man cannot climb the ladder of college success in the 
classroom, on the playing field, or in the cliquish sphere, he may try his 
luck on an unsuspecting woman's dormroom. Sexual intercourse, and its 
public appeal, has become man's ultimate and last status symbol. If a 
male is rejected by a woman, and a few of his most imponant relations 
discover that and ridicule him, or appear to be ridiculing him, that man 
may become a potential rapist. 

We have all been ridiculed by someone at different points during our 
lives. That, of course, does not give us license to be reactionaries, and 
cast our ills at others by playing the same vicious game. Rapists are 
people who are most often extremely insecure about themselves, and 
who have a constant, foreboding fear of failure. The United States, with 
its history of dogged competitiveness and unethical imperialism, is an 
empire on the decline. As the power of this country wanes over the next 
few decades, we are sure to see a rise in the amount of rapes from coast 
to coast, unless we act quickly to nip the causes of rape at the bud. 

By focusing on how we play into the rapist'S context - by the jokes 
we tell, by the type of machoism we condone, or by the way we fuel 
patriarchy in our panicipation in its venical scheme - we can discover 
how we might impell our society to shy away from violent displays of 
feeling impotent. There are only so many dark alleys that we can shed 
anificiallight upon, as the rapist'S horrific world exists not only in 
shadowed comers, but in broad daylight amidst the most seemingly 
innocent of all our actions and conversations. At this pOint, we need an 
explOSion of conscious effon to tum back those 24-hour nights.

I T happened one fateful momin . After 12 years of devote1 service for Kirk's 
Construction, Inc., Cecil Ippert, 
alas, feD victim to Harry's 
Laboratory Drug Testing Service. 

"Cecil," Kirk said, motioning 
Cecil into his office. "You 
disappoint me. For years, you 
have led my company through 
thick and thin, but 1 must admit 
I am not surprised at this 
sudden upset. Your track record 
in recent months has not been 
up to par." 

"But I didn't do it! Harry's the 
one on drugs! He must have 
mixed up the test samples ... . " 

"Nonsense! Your urine never 
lies. The analysis proved 
positive. Harry even went a step 
furt her, performing the highly 
impressive gas chromatography, 
mass spectromeny test, which, as 
you know, can detect molecular 
fragments of drugs present in 
urine. 

"Listen, Cecil. You seU-
proclaimed druggies cost us 
American corporations over $1 
biOion last year. A company was 
not in vogue unless its costs rose 
and its profits feD. Why, we 
couldn't even afford to throw our 
annual Kirk's Kick-Off 
Construction Cook-a-Thon last 
spring, because you druggies 
called in absent so often. Thank 
God, most users neglect to fill 
out worker compensation claims 
- saved me considerable money 
there. I really must thank you:

OPINIONS 

On gendered polarities 
By PATRICIA OROZCO 

when she suddenly must look to 
fmd her self, so she stretches 
Inward to dIS over what is 
Inside, perhaps only to find an 
ex ruclating emptiness and the 
biner remnams of how she has 
been glvmg herself away. 

It has been through the falseness 
of these images that men and 
women have feared each Olher 
throughout history: the womanly 
wiles and the savagery of men -
if men are to be subject to the 
deceptiveness of femlnme 
schemes. then women in 

consequence must be subJcct to 
rape and male dommanon From 
this. we have only to assess our 
own gullibility in havrng believed 
in the first place thar men and 
women are so distam and 
differcnt, and 10 reality at 
opposite ends of every gender-
related issue. 

Human hves are much too 
precious to let wither within 
ideological cages of gender 
polari ties. There arc eons of 
worlds between mdividuals 
without having to draw further 

distance between the sexes. 
Femmlst have been given the 
task to discover what It means to 
be a woman. to recreate 
womanhood and femininity in 
the likeness of their own 
individuality, to transcend the 
stagnation of "maleness" and 
"femaleness" as prescribed by the 
church and state , and in the 
process all ow men to redefine 
themselves within the slightly 
alien but extremely positive 
framework of being - whic h is 
femrnism. !m 

"Ie is one of ehe nlOse persistent of 
fallacies that complex political and 
moral issues can be seteled by an 
appeal to the facts .' Asu1e from the 
dijJiculcy of finding dislrteerested 
Irtveseigarors - anyone who 
presume~ the reliability of current 
research inco sex difference (let 
alone extrapolation of ehe data by 
male sIXial scientists) has already 
reJected the fenllnist analysis -

Why is It thar once we have 
allocated the traditional sex-
related vIrTues to men and then 
to women we find a polarlry so 
vast that the same word 
on notes twO difTerent meanings 

to each gender? Is it possible 
that among suc h extremes as the 
"femintne' passitiviry and the 
"mas uline" dommance, there 
can eXIst an)'thrng but an 
exploitative imeractlon? And If 
needed , we have constructed a 
world of Amencan dualities, 
where Westcrn imperialism has 
set the lOne for abUSIve relations 
between capitalist and 
developing nations, how can we, 
as femimsts or as potential 
femmlsts . understand how the 
more apparent practices of our 
soclery translates into the 
microcosm of relations between 
men and women?

murderers who are alive and

Be ause all of us, In some way, 
have sufTered under the gender-
specifications Imposed upon 
human beings. Men have been 
held responSible for the 
emotional, phYSIcal and SOCial 
state of the women in theIr lives 
for much toO long, whIle at the 
same time they have been Judged 
m terms of whal they could 
proVide for a woman's SOCIal 
slatus. On the other side. there 
is a time m every woman's life 

Still, as Ellen Willis explains, 
movements are not wrought out 
of abstract rhetoric but rather out 
of flesh and blood. and of lives 
that have been mutilated through 
the SOCIal and emononal abuse 
rendered upon them by a short· 
SIghted defmltlon of what it 
means to be a man or a woman. 

Many of the deCISIOns of the 
Bird COUrt and these three 
Justices are ridIculous. Bernard 
Lee Hamilton was convicted of 
the 1979 murder of Eleanore 
Buchanan in San Diego. His 
sentence was overturned because 
the JUry did not specifically find 
that Hamilton intended to kill 
despite the fact that the victim's 
hands and head had been cut 
from her body. 

On October 20, 1979. Rodney

convtctlon for assaults on an 8-
year old girl , a 13-year old and a 
thIrd conviction involving a 15-
year old hitch-hiker whom he 
tied up , "stuffed aT-shirt in her 
mouth , beat her unconscious, 
and raped her vaginally and 
anally ." BIrd, Grodon and 
Reynoso voted to reverse his 
conviction, deciding it was 
improper to bring evidence of 
Alcala's prior violent sex crimes 
before the jury because they were 
not similar enough to Robin 's 
murder. Wrote justice Grodin: 
"Robin was killed, while the 
earlier victims were not." 

These are just IWO of the 
dozens of ridiculous, twisted 
decisions regarding murderers, 
given by the Bird Supreme Court. 
The Bird Court is soft on other 
crimes, too. [n a study of 325 
criminal cases judged by Rose 
Bird, she voted for the criminal 
88 percent of the time . Reynoso 

voted for the criminal 86 percent 
of the time and Grodin 84 
percent. By contrast, only in 9 
percent of the cases studied did 
justlce Malcomb Lucas vote for 
the criminal. Remember, before 
these cases were even heard by 
the State Supreme Court II 
JUrors unanimously voted for 
conviction with a trial judge 
presiding, plus they were upheld 
by an Appellate Coun of three 
judges. 

At last count , over 25 County 
Sheriffs and 170 Chiefs of Police 
publicly oppose Birel Reynoso 
and Grodin. A recent poll of 
California prosecutors showed 
strong opposition to Reynoso 
and Grodin with 94 percent 
opposed to the reconfinna tion of 
Bird. We need a court that will 
protect victims, not criminals. [ 
urge everyone to vote NO on 
Bird, Reynoso and Grodin .

fonner model, Simonton was 
gang raped in New York Cil)' In

went to the police station. she 
was required to have 

property," Simonton said. "Men 
have little respect for women and 
shirk total responsibilil)' for rape 
and blame it on 'theIr natural 
hormones' and sa y that they 
cannot stop themselves. The 
blame is totaDy dumped on 
women , and year after year, 
women continue to take It. Men 
have a lot of anger around a 
beautiful woman because it takes 
away their power. and men feel 
threatened. This leads to rape -
the domination of one over 
anOther," Simonton said

"no" she actua lly means "yes," 
Virga explained. 

A while ago, a "needle and 
thread" analogy was commonly 
presented in coun in the rape 
suspect's defen~e . The analogy 
argued that in order for a needle 
to be threaded. the needle has to 
be kept perfe t1y still. Likewise, a 
woman could not be raped 
unless she kept perfectly still. 
That is . the fact that she was 
a mally able to be raped proves 
that she did not resist and that 
she did not resist proves that 
she actually wanted it . Virga 
added.

not very supportive of the rape

Just now. however, incidences of 
child abuse and date rape arc

the forefront , Virga said, 

[n an October ew Woman

women, 30 percent of the 
women responded that they had 
"been raped or forced to have 
sex against their will by a 
datellover/ husband. Fifty-three 
percent had not. [n both cases, 
15 percent of the women did not 
answer the question. Doctors 
Helen Si nger Kaplan and Willa 
Bernhard comment that the 15 
percent of the women who did 
not respond to these questions 
"implies that these are indeed 
sensitive areas."

Finding the answers on the plaza 
By CINDY BALDERRAMA 

I the midst of the ever-evolving world of students, one man awaIts the 
-.:hallenge of prOVIding comfort , 
food for thought, and answers to 
the spiritual and Intellectual 
questions that students have 
regarding religious affairs and hfe 
In general. 

As I made my way into the 
busthng crowd of students. \ 
spotted him in a small remote 
comer of the Revelle plaza, He 
was standing behmd a small 
table sheltered from the hot 
aftemoon sun by a small shady 
tree . engaged 10 a relaxed 
onversation with a student. He 

was casually clad in blue jeans 
and a blue conon shirt, which 
blended in perfectly with the 
mesh of students, There was a 
senes <;>f books. pamphlets and 
brochures scattered about the top 
of the little table whose lable 
seemed to speak for itself wi th 
the bold and challengi ng 
statement, "Atheism is 
Inconsistent," 

Upon seeing me, this 
mysterious man, otherwise 
known as Reverand Bob Siegel, 
the founder and pastor of 
Sojourners Christian Fellowship. 
warmly shook my hand and 

suggested that we Sl[ on the 
stone wall behind the table, away 
from the crowd. 

Siegel: who received a 
bachelor's degree In theatre arts 
from San Jose State University , 
and a master's degree in biblilical 
studies from the Denver 
TheologIcal Seminary. has 
established the foundation for 
his new church here in an 
Diego. This church primarily 
reaches out to college students 
but is currently drawing people 
from outside the campus as well . 

According to Siegel, Sojourners 
presently has forty active 
participants and holds its 
student outreach services at the 
University Lutheran Church . He 
says that Sojourners is "one of 
many viable church options. We 
are nOt out here to say that we 
are a better church than others. 
We do some of the things that 
other churches do and some 
things that they don't do." 

Siegel says that Sojourners 
offers three main services to its 
members. The members 
participate in worship and 
fellowship, which entails a 
sermon , active discussion and 
singmg. Presently, Siegel is 
o rganizing classes to teach his 

members more about the 
"academic SIde of Christianity." 

Thi~ Includes church history, 
theology and how to defend 
one's religious convictions and 
faith through the use of reason , 
which is a branch of theology 
called apologetics. Finally, 
SOjourners has what Siegel 
calls"Agape" groups. These are 
small support, study and prayer 
groups that give members a 
chance to establish close 
relationships with each other. 

Christianity. He felt the need to 
establish his ministry here in the 
United States rather than other 
countnes because he was 
con erned about the level of 
confusion that is present in 
society with regard to 
Christianity. Siegel feels that a lot 
of the time this is brought about 
by a number of evangelists who 
Impose their own views o n what 
they think Christianity is rather 
than presenting the true aspec.:l~ 
of the faith . 

({In a very direct way God spoke to me 
and communicated His reality, Nothing 
short of that would have convinced me of 
anything. " 

Siegel's mission has been "to 
introduce people to Jesus Christ, 
to help them learn more about 
r! I,' Bible and then to organize 
people into a fellowship ." He 
says that, "we believe that Jesus 
Christ really was God and that 
he came to this world as a 
human being so thar people 
could learn how to establish a 
relationship with Him ." 

Siegel , who is Originally fro m 
San Jose, came from a Jewish 
Atheist family. He says he did 
not convert to Christianity unol 
his second year of college. Siegel 
attributes his conversion to 
Ch ristiani ty to both 'the study of 
the Bible and an event he 
described as a "direct mystical 
experience with Jesus Christ. \ n 
a very direct way God spoke to 
me and communicated His 
reality. othing short of that 
would have convinced me of 
anything" 

Up until this point in his life , 
Siegel claims that he , "had 
absolutely no interest in the 
religiOUS at all. \ was heavily 
involved in dramas mostly from 

-Bob Siegel 
Siegel explained that he 

doesn't hold any judgments or 
prejudices against any Christ ian 
denominations, When asked to 
explain his thoughts and feelings 
about the difTerent 
denominations with regard to his 
own church, Siegel explained, 
"We [Sojourners I are an 
interdenominational church. I 
am concerned about uniti ng 
Christians together. not so much 
in a physical way, I don't believe 
that Christians have to be under 
the same roof to prove that they 
have uni ty," Siegel continued, 
"there needs to be unity that 
recognizes the value of diverSity ," 

With in the last few years that 
he has been building the 
foundations for his church, 
Siegel says he has been working 
for a group called Campus 
Ambassadors which is a 
missionary, non-profit 
organization that is involved in 
campus ministry. 

,"",,'0_'.- the point of view of writing," 

Siegel claims that the mission 
society is presently supporting 
Sojourners here at UCSD. 
However, Siegel says, "now that 
we are starting a church I'm on a 
descending scale, so my salary is 
getting cut every s ix months in 
the hopes thar'those that come 
into our church will take it upon 
themselves to become financially 

"Bob Si(ge/ can often be seen on the plaZJl discussing various issues with 
students, .. 

Prodigal Poet

It began with the beating of one man, 
His hands palming the face of the drum. 

I His mouth worked the words of a song, 
But they told him to quiet, 
And forced him down. 
But the beating continued , 
And his song was reborn in many voices. 
They sing a song 
That is not different, 
And ask only that we sing with them. 
Yet the discord of angry voices buries these 
words, 
And our song loses meaning. 

Though the beating continues, 

We are deaf. -k 

Siegel has since fel t the need 
to reach out to college students 
and to people in general who are 
"turned off' by religIon and who 
have misunderstandings about

Though Siegel runs an 
Interdenomina tional church, he 
was ordained a Bapti st minister, 
He explained that, "I was 
o rdained as a Baptist because 
the missionary SOCiety that I 
worked for had its roots in th e 
Baptist church, But, they also 
have a very interdenominational 
emphasis and so I do not refer 
to myself as a Baptist, JUSt a 
Christian. really .. ," 

UCSD has its share of 
Christian ministeries, suc h as th e 
Catholic Community and 
Intervarsity Fellowship , but Siegel 
felt the need to reach o ut 
particularly to alleviate some of 
the misconceptions that many 
students have about Christianity 
and perhaps to increase interest 
through his own outreach 
program, 

Prior to coming to UCSD, 
Siegel worked in a series of 
campus ministeries and focused 
primarily on college students. It 
wasn't until recently, when he 
came to San Diego, that he 
began to apply his ministery to 
people outside the campus, 

He most recently ministered at 
UC Santa Barbara for five years . 
"\ started that ministry from 
scratch, Campus Ambassadors 
was sending people to campuses 
that didn 't have campus 
ministeries. There was one other 
group there - Intervarsi ty. There 
was no com petition, I started out 
with nine people in our first 
Bible study and at the end of 
that first year we got about 
twenty involved. When \ left 
there were about one hundred 
people participating, Some of the 
people that we had led to Christ 
had by that time already been 
halfway through seminaries 
themselves and had been 
learning the ministry," Siegel 
said. Siegel left the Santa Barbara 
ministry because he felt it was in 
good hands and stable enough to 
continue suq:essfully, 

Siegel had been made aware 01 
UCSD's reputation for being

somewhat "apathetic to 
Christian ity" and thus saw 
coming to UCSD as a challenge, 
I was warned by so many people 
not to come here , and I began 
realizing then that that was why 
I had to come here ." 

Siegel claimed that UCSD does 
not seem quite as "heated" about 
Christianity as some of the other 
campuses he has worked with , 
He thinks, however, that this has 
significantly changed due to the 
new Atheist/ Christian debates 
th at have taken place on 
campus. These debates were 
sponsored by th e new group 
ailed Agnostics/ Atheists, Siegel 

says that these debates have 
sparked new interest in 
Christianity and have been well 
atte nded . 

Siegel says that the debates 
have been primarily cqncerned 
with evidence of the validity of 
Chris ti anity as rational and as 
true . Siegel has proved to be 
quite a challe nging o pponent in 
the debates due to his own 
experience as an Atheist and 
had, therefore, anticipated many 
of the questions that he was 
co nfronted with . He says that 
during the times that he has 
engaged in discussion with 
Atheists that he feels , "in many 
ways it's like going back in time 
and talking to myself." 

Siegel says that he agrees with 
the Atheists' belief that people 
are rational and logical beings 
that should not be led blindly by 
fait h, He says that suc h 
misconceptions as this about 
C hristianity are what concern 
him as a minister. SIegel says 
that other common 
misconceptions regarding 
Christianity are that Christians 
center their faith on the afterlife, 
that they believe in the Moral 
Majori ty and that they see 
themselves as perfect bei ngs . 

Siegel stressed that 
C hristianity is concerned with 
the present life but mainly with 
improving one's life and 
relationships wi th others. He 
says that human beings are not 
perfect but that "all human 
beings are capable of being good 
social citizens." Siegel 
demonstrates his point about the 
process of becoming a better 
person as he says "the way that \ 
look at it is through the analogy 
of bei ng half clean and half dirty , 
We can argue that there is a 
clean side and be right, while at 
the same time we can take a 
shower and become completely 
clean. Becoming a Christian docs 
nOt mean you become completely 
clean overnight. It mean s you are 
involved in a process by which 
God is working in your life and 
changing you and making you a 
be tter person. It does nOt mean

Siegel added that people 
should realize that "the Bible 
cornes from the same genre that 
other anc ient histories did ," That 
as far as the miracles are 
concemed, "people in the 
twentieth century have 
accomplished feats themselves 
that people just two centuries 
ago would have thought 
miraculous, When the Bible talks 
about miracles it is not talking 
about God waving a magic 
wand ," 

Outside of his ministry Siegel 
enjoys writing plays and usuaUy 
has time to do so during school 
breaks. Usua lly his plays are 
focused on getting people to 
"think about the issues of life." 
He is presently preparing a 
production called Pandora's Child 
for the campus. 

When asked what his plans 
were after his work at UCSD, he 
said he plans to get involved in 
anOther mini stry - one that 
ministers to the clergy of 
Chris tian communities. He plans 
to study church clergy and polity 
and incorporate his findings into 
his dramas. He says he would 
also like to encourage and 
sup p Ort the issue of women 
ordination, 

Siegel plans to stay at UCSD 
for at least five years and feels 
that his work will be completed 
when he knows that the church 
will grow and prosper. ~

Here's (Claremont) "Mudd" • In your eye 
Playoff hopes still alive as UCSD skins Stags -.:~~ 
By GUS SANTOYO, sports Editor 

Simply put, it was a brawl. But this 'War at Warren,~ it was the poim of no return 
for UCSD. If the Tritons lose, it's 
adios to the playoffs. 

The Tritons have gotten a 
reprieve for now as they beat 
Claremont-Mudd 2-1 , yesterday 
in a soccer game that came close 
to becoming a rugby match. 
Warren Field became a combat 
zone with bodies being used as 
lethal weapons. Several yellow 
cards were drawn, but for 
Claremont coach Steve Davis, it 
was a hard, clean match. 

"There were some vicious 
tackles out there: said Davis. 
"But overall it was a good, hard 
spirited match. UCSD was in the 
more desperate situation, and as 
is the case in any sport, if you 

have to win , more likely than not 
you will, and they did." 

The Tritons looked sluggish in 
the first half and trailed 1-0. But 
a when the tearns changed goals 
at halftime, UCSD had the wind 
at their backs. For Davis, that 
was one of the major factors in 
the game. 

"When we had the wind at 
our backs, we dominated the ball 

~me, when they had it, they 
dominated. It was that kind of a 
game." 

In the second half, UCSD was 
able to shift the momentum and 
controlled the ball for most of 
the second half. After several 
threats, Robert Patterson scored 
after a mad scramble in front of 
the net. About fou r minutes later, 
Patterson did some shifty 

Greg SchlWll"Z blast his shot Jor UCSD's second goal.

dribbling around the Claremont

glanced off Steve Goodson, 
Claremont goalkeeper, and then 
Greg Schwarz followed the shot 
into the net for the 2-1 score, 

Nevertheless, luck, which has 
been in plentiful supply for the 
Tritons lately, came in a 
bountiful harvest in this game. 

Triton playoff hopes, although 
slim, are still alive. 'UCSD is an 
excellent team and I don't think 
this was a must game win for 
them," said Davis. "Who else 
would play from our region?" 

UCSD coach Derek Annstrong 
sees one major task at hand. 
'We're going to have to win the 
rest of our games and even 
though we have one less loss 
than Claremont, we've beaten 
them now, so our chances to 
make the playoffs look pretty 
good."

Game 5 from the Angels , Boston subsequently

Boston to continue this pattern all the way 
through the Series with the Mets. Their hItters,

Although th is year there is no designated

in the playoffs, his three-run homer in Game 7

Series. If he gets hot and if Evans, Armas and

ove r his childish attitude and 
shaky emotional stability. With 
Tom Seaver out with a bad knee, 
AI Nipper may start a game for 
the Sox. Although he had a poor 
season this year, Nipper can still 
bring the heater. In the bullpen, 
Calvin Schiraldi is the stopper, 
who after his disasterous 
performance in Game 4. came 
back to pitch extremely well in 
Games 5 and 7. Bob Stanley, Joe 
Sambito and Steve Crawford 
shore up the rest of the bullpen. 
Stanely, a perennial Red Sox 
scapegoat, may eve ntually come 

through in a big game. Sambito, 
whose career looked over at the 
beginning of the year, has 
pitched well and he and 
Crawford have been ideal set-up 
men for Schiraldi. 

Boston's lack of speed may be 
a fac tor (Barret! led the team 
with only 15 steals), but don't be 
surprised if Boggs, Barrell and 
Owens don't test "Glamour Boy" 
Gary Carter's arm. Now that the 
Red Sox are looking at offensive 
rallies as something besides 
three-run-homers, players like 

MI-_ ..... .,· .. 

Boggs and Barrett are invaluable 
in their ability to get on base for 
the big guns of Rice, Baylor, 

Evans and Armas. 

All that's left is the prediction. 
The Mets pitching is looking 
very hittable and their bats seem 
to be dragging. Because of this 
and combined with Boston's 
remarkable ability to come from 
behind (with much thanks to 
Gene Mauch), the Red Sox 
should win in six. Don't be too 
shocked if Boston ends it on 
their home field in Game 5. ~

Kurt Bell In rare action. 

Ringing the Bell 
By KAREN KUMM, Staff Writer 

EVERY SPOrtS team has as star players and its ordinary players. Usually 
the stars get all the exposure, but 
there IS a definite need for the 
coverage of the not-so-famous 
"benchwarmers' of UC D. The 
men's soccer team has a four-
year player who sull finds 
himself on the sidehnes dUTlng 

of the games. Kun Bell 
Jokes about being a benchwarmer 
in his founh season , but 

conllnues to love rhe game. 
Having played si nce the age of 

ix, the spon of soccer is a fixed 
pan of his lifestyle. In his 
younger years, he was a tOp 
player, sometimes winning MVP 
awards. U 111 verstty level soccer is 
much more competit ive and Bell 
accepts thiS. "A lot of the plu),ers 
on the team were at rhe tOP of 
their league in high s hool: they 
arc really good." Yet Bell is so 
dedicated to the SpOrt that he 

has never considered quitting. 
He, along with a lot of mher 
team member , place soccer 
before school."1 figure you can 
take elas es over, but you can't 
take a season over" 

A baSIC love of so cer and 
winning is what keep Bell 
playing the game. He is a 
substitute, playing when the 
forwards and outside halves get 
injured. tired or have a bad day. 
Coach Derek Arm trong gives all 
the players a chance to prove 
themselves, and Bell has staned 
in games before . Of 
approximately seven substi tutes, 
he has been on the team the 
longest. The camaraderie 

involved with being on th e team 
has hi m hooked; most of his 
be t frie nds play. 

Most frustrati ng of all to Bell 
arc those games were he doesn't 
play at all . Playing so cer is like 
a drug to him; an insta nt upper. 
But most times he's in constant 
withdrawal, standing while on 
the ideline completely 
engrossed 111 the action . In hiS 
typicallight-heaned manner, he 
defmed his occassional tllne on 
the bench as "a lime to 
contribute on and off the field ." 
For Kun Bell. the opponunity to 
play soccer, no matter how 
infrequent, is reason enough to 
be on the UCSD team. ~
