The University of California 
announced Sept. 27 that it reached a 
$1 million settlement with the victims 
of last year’s pepper spray incident 
at UC Davis. The settlement ends a 
class action lawsuit filed by 21 plain-
tiffs seeking compensation from the 
university for being doused in pepper 
spray during a Nov. 18 Occupy move-
ment protest.

The settlement states each victim 
will receive $30,000 and a handwritten 
apology letter from UCD Chancellor 
Linda Katehi. According to the Los 
Angeles Times, UC will need to pay 
$250,000 in attorney fees and set aside 
$100,000 for any victims who may not 
have been part of the original class 
action suit.

Last year’s now-infamous pepper 
spray incident made national headlines 
after videos of UCPD Lt. John Pike 
deliberately spraying protesters in the 
face with pepper spray went viral.

Since the incident, the University of 
California has taken steps to assess the 
situation and create preventative meth-
ods for future protest-related issues. 

In April, a task force commissioned 
by UC President Mark G. Yudof and 
led by former State Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Cruz Reynoso found that 
campus police had acted beyond their 
authority during the incident.

On July 31, UC Police announced 
that Pike was no longer with the force.

A final version of a separate report 
was released on Sept. 13 — this one 
commissioned by Yudof seeking advice 
on possible changes from UC General 
Counsel Charles F. Robinson and Cal

UCSD’s dish-deposit Toby Spots 
program has been discontinued this 
Fall Quarter in favor of new recyclable 
ware. Associate Director for Dining 
and Retail Services Steve Cassad said 
the Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Department expects that the recycla-
ble dishware will be beneficial to the 
environment and easily disposed of.

“The to-go ware recyclables are 
recyclable everywhere on campus,”

The University of California Office 
of the President will begin meeting 
in Sacramento on Oct. 2 to flesh out 
the details of an emergency budget 
initiative, called “rebenching”, set to be 
implemented during the 2013-14 aca-
demic year. “Rebenching” is an initia-
tive that requires the state to allocate 
every UC campus the same amount of 
funding per student. 

The University of California 
Academic Senate, a body of faculty 
members from all 10 UC campuses, 
passed the initiative in July.

The UC system received roughly 
$2.4 billion in funding from the state 
of California for the 2011-12 year, 10.9 
percent of the state budget. This is a 
nearly 60 percent decrease from the 

$3.8 billion the UC system received 
for the 1991-92 school year. As the 
state funding shrank throughout the 
90’s, state funding was preferentially 
provided to the fastest-growing cam-
puses.

Because there was even less money 
available during the following decade, 
the allocation policy became even 
more complicated. The inequalities 
piled up over the years, causing cer-
tain campuses to receive much more 
state funding than others. UCLA, for 
instance, received $6,413 per student 
for the 2011-12 academic year, while 
UCSD received $5,499 per student 
for the same period. The two smallest 
UCs--Riverside and Merced — will be 
treated separately under the rebench-
ing scheme. They will receive signifi-
cantly less per-student funding from 
the state. 

Susan Gillman and James Chalfant, 
professors at UC Santa Cruz and UC 
Davis, respectively, served as co-chairs 
of the “Rebenching Task Force” within 
the Academic Senate. In a letter they 
sent to UC faculty members in July, 
Gillman and Chalfant wrote that “no 

one [could] explain the reasons for 
the funding disparities” between cam-
puses.

“Rebenching is the single largest 
reform tool the university has in its 
direct control,” they wrote in the letter. 

The rebenching measures were 
approved by the Academic Senate 
with the expectation that either Prop 
30 or Prop 38 will pass in the Nov. 
6 general election this year. Prop. 30 
would set aside funding from high-
er sales taxes for students at public 
universities. Prop. 38 would provide 
funding for the same group using a 
steeper income tax rate.

If both of these measures fail to 
pass, the academic senate will have to 
equalize state funding in other ways. 
Systemwide units, such as the UC 
observatories, laser centers, hospitals 
and clinics, would be the first to go.  

“A second source of funding would 
be savings from reducing allocations 
to systemwide units. A third option 
would be reductions in allocations to 
the best-funded campuses,” Gilman 
and Chalfant wrote. 

UC President Mark G. Yudof stat-

ed that if measures like Prop 30 and 
Prop 38 do not pass this November, 
implementation of the rebenching 
scheme will be problematic, espe-
cially for well-funded campuses like 
UC Davis and UCLA. He empha-
sized the importance of increasing 
appropriations for the university post-
rebenching.

“We have a $22 billion-plus bud-
get, and only $2 million will come 
from the state of California,” Yudof 
said. 

UCSD Scripps Professor and 
Divisional Representative to the 
Systemwide Assembly of the Academic 
Senate John Hildebrand stated in an 
email to The Guardian that a rebench-
ing scheme would likely be “diffi-
cult to implement” without additional 
money. He served on the Rebenching 
Task Force this summer as well as dur-
ing the 2011-12 academic year.

“Inequities are built into the sys-
tem,” he said.

UCOP Details Emergency Budget Initiative
Uc SyStem

UC Office of the 
President meets in 
Sacramento to go over 
initiative passed in July.

CAMPUS — UCSD’s Campus Clean 
Renewable Energy Project set a sus-
tainability goal to be “climate neutral” 
by 2025. To do so, the campus has 
implemented a variety of sustainable 
efforts, including the installation of 
solar panels. 

UCSD installed a  267 kilowatt  
solar panel on top of the two story, 
200,000 square feet Trade Street 
Warehouse located between the I-805 
and I-15. The warehouse is currently 
used for housing and staging, library 
storage and bookstore shipments. 
Other sustainability projects include 
operating on a natural-gas-fired com-
bined heat-and-power system that 
provides 85 percent of the campus’s 
annual electricity needs, increasing 
the energy efficiency in 25 of the 
older buildings and the solar-thermal 
water heating system at the North 
Campus Housing Phase II project.

butions — for his work with nuclear 
astrophysics, especially his research 
on neutrino flavor-mixing in super-
novae. The society gives the reward 
annually to “recognize outstanding 
work in theory, experiment or obser-
vation in the areas of astrophysics, 
nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics,

SAN DIEGO — A killer whale 
was injured during a performance 

at SeaWorld last week. Nakai, an 
11-year-old male, badly injured the 
underside of his jaw during an appar-
ent altercation with other orcas dur-
ing a night performance.

During the show, a large portion 
of the whale’s flesh under the jaw was 
sliced off to the point that bone was 
showing. After the performance, the 
orca returned to a back pool of the 
stadium, until the trainers noticed 
Nakai’s injury during a later part of 
the show.

Cassad wrote in an email. “The Toby 
Spot dishware is not recyclable so we 
expect to find fewer disposables in the 
trash, which will lower the amount of 
trash that goes to the landfill.” 

Cassad said the Toby Spot pro-
gram, which began in Fall 2008, was 
considered successful because it was 
convenient for students. However, 
there were problems with the loss of 
dishware each year.

“Theft was not a concern in the 
implementation of the Toby Spot 
program nor was it a factor in the 
decision to remove the Toby Spots,” 
Cassad said. “The larger issue was 
the lack of available cleanware to 
serve patrons during rush periods (or 
directly after) due to abundance of 
ware that was taken to-go to offices 

and residences.”
In the minutes report of the 

April 17, 2012 HDH meeting, HDH 
Executive Director Mark Cunningham 
said that the Toby Spot program was 
sustainable, but that it cost approxi-
mately $200,000 to replace lost plates 
and utensils each year. In the report, 
Cunningham said that the program 
was being reviewed for improvement 
during Spring Quarter 2012.

Cassad said that cost was not a fac-
tor in the removal of the Toby Spots, 
and that the program did not cost 
more than the cost of offering the new 
disposables.

“It is a standard expense within 
services as large as our program to 
have to replace dishware and utensils,” 
Cassad wrote. “The numbers do not 
indicate that the Toby Spot program 
had a greater expense than offering 

disposables.”
Cassad wrote that HDH hopes 

that the new recyclable dishes will 
promote the proper disposal of items, 
for example, recycling plastic ware 
and reducing contaminated and com-
ingled refuse. Additionally, Cassad 
said that HDH anticipates that the 
new recyclables will lead to more 
composting and benefit the commu-
nity overall.

“We anticipate that students will 
decide to eat in our dining halls more 
often which has a positive commu-
nity building impact and provides 
accessibility to post-consumer com-
post refuse bins (food scrap bins),” 
Cassad said.

Upon hearing that OVT has became an all-you-can-eat caf-eteria, one word came to mind: finally. With 31 percent of undergraduates living on campus, it is important to have a 
variety of eating options — and that includes switching up the por-
tion sizes of meals.

Students now have an option between one all-you-can-eat caf-
eteria, six à la carte dining halls, two sit down restaurants and six 
markets. The current dining plan for dorm residents is $2,950 for 
the year, which amounts to just under $14 a day. A meal at OVT 
of a sandwich ($4.50), a bag of chips ($0.99), and a fountain drink 
($1.30), can already take up half of the money allotted to the day. 
This is fine if you take a few meals off to eat out or go home for a 
weekend, but if you demand more food than this in a meal, your 
meal points will be gone by Christmas. According to the United 
States Department of Agriculture, males over 18 require between 
2,000 and 3,000 calories per day. The à la carte cafeteria design 
does not account for a 3,000 calorie diet, with entire entree and 
sides ranging from 400 to 900 calories total. 

Muir College’s Pines tried to address the issue of too small por-

tions this year by adding nearly double the meat to sandwiches 
at the carving station. However, this move was negated by the 
fact that the sandwiches shot up from about $6 to $8 this fall. 
According to Sodexho, one of the largest college food providers in 
the U.S., dining hall executives have stated that students are divided 
on their preference for AYCE and à la carte cafeterias. The com-
pany said that the difference lies in how much a student eats, with 
students who eat below average favoring à la carte, and students 
with above average appetites obviously preferring a buffet option.

And that is why a buffet lunch priced at $8.95 sounds reason-
able, and even economical for students with large appetites. The 
other meals vary in price, with breakfast for $7.95, and dinner for 
$10.95. Yet, these prices are still higher than other campuses with 
UCLA’s buffets costing $5.50, $7.00 and $8.25, and UCSC’s buf-
fets at $7.65, $8.29 and $9.80. Students are comparatively spending 
more for endless portions, so prices could still use some improve-
ment. While the all-you-can-eat cafeteria will help students save 

A Lot on Your Plate

Last Thursday, my Facebook newsfeed was flooded with statuses from fellow seniors, 
rhapsodizing about the “last first day,” 
how “just yesterday” we were eating 
mediocre dining hall food and, of 
course, observing that time seems to 
pass more quickly now. I remember 
the curse of Plaza meals too clearly to 
join this circle jerk of sentimentalism, 
but there’s still truth here: It doesn’t 
feel like three years have passed since 
I refused to go to Convocation except 
to stockpile ice cream sandwiches. 

Cognitive psychologists have 
established that the feeling of time 
speeding up as we grow older is 

a time perception phenomenon 
common across cultures and ages. In 
a study from Cinch Valley College in 
Virginia, scientists asked two groups 
of people—young adults between 
19 and 24, and older adults between 
60 and 80—to note when they 
thought three minutes had passed. 
On average, the younger group was 
accurate, making a note at the 3:03 
mark. Older adults thought that three 
minutes had passed nearly 40 seconds 
after the fact.

On the day-to-day scale, these 
findings about time perception are 
merely fodder for adages about 
watched pots. But zooming out, the 
situation seems more dire: According 
to University of Cincinnati studies 
from the 1970s, the rate of “life 
speeding up” is so pronounced 
that, at 20, most of us have already 
subjectively experienced half our 
lives, meaning the rest will pass 
by in an ever-speeding blur. It’s 
existentially horrifying to consider 
that, at 21, my experienced life 
may be half over, and yet the major 
highlights from the past few years 
are such fascinating events as 
moving off campus, and getting an A 
in the class I never went to. 

The generally accepted 
explanation for this finding is 
that unfamiliar experiences make 
the brain work harder creating 
deeper impact and making time 
seem slower. Since childhood (and 
freshman year) is full of “firsts,” 
these years seem to stretch forever 
as first play date is followed by first 
sleepover game is followed by first 
kiss (and first class is followed by 
first roommate fight is followed by 
first “getting stranded at a party,” 
though maybe not in that order). 
But as we age, our “firsts” become far 
and few in-between, so everything 
starts to feel more automated and, 
therefore, faster. 

Until physicists step up their 
game, there’s no real way to slow 
time so for now, the Band-Aid 
solution is altering our perception 
to make our lives feel longer. In 
other words, there are plenty of 
cheesy reasons to try new things, but 
given that saying yes to late-night 
adventures that cross three different 
cities (been there, in an experience I 
now call “the day without a night”) 
may be the only way to extend our 
lives, there’s little reason to stay 
inside. Happy Week One.

Field 
        Notes

AngelA Chen
shchen@ucsd.edu

After two days of ongoing 
negotiations, the NFL and the 
officials’ union have reached a 
tentative eight-year agreement 
to end a labor dispute that began 
in June. While the NFL lockout 
frustrated hordes of fans, coaches 
and players, it ultimately paid 
off for the owners because of an 
increase in viewership.

Before the start of the latest 
season, the union officiating crews 
demanded the NFL pay them an 
extra $60,000 per team annually. 
But NFL Commissioner Roger 
Goodell initially declined to pay, 
instead hiring less experienced 
replacement officials. Naturally, 
this inexperience made them 
more prone to making refereeing 
mistakes. Fans and teams were 
shocked, but many casual 
observers tuned in to chuckle at 
the confusion and indecisiveness of 
the amateur referees — and to see 
some of the worst calls in football 
history.

The lousy officiating of the 
‘scab’ referees, or workers who 

refuse membership in labor unions,  
gained the NFL lots of attention 
from unlikely spectators. In fact, 
the games’ ratings went up as much 
as 8 percent from last year’s and 
topped all 30 NFL markets over the 
past three weeks. Last Monday’s 
Packers-Seahawks game — which 
caused an uproar because of a 
bizarre last-second win for Seattle 
over Green Bay due to a false 
touchdown call — averaged 16.2 
million viewers, ranking as the 
most-watched cable program in the 
last eight months. As viewership 
soared, ad dollars and TV licensing 
agreements poured into the NFL.

Eventually, the NFL had no 
choice but to take the officials’ 
union back in a last-ditch effort 
to protect the brand. The union 
referees have returned and 
the football connoisseurs have 
been satisfied. Meanwhile, the 
management is laughing all the way 
to the bank.

ended with union officials and 
the NFL signing an eight-year 
deal promising higher wages and 
pensions. However, the first three 
weeks of the regular NFL season 
with the replacement referees has 
exposed just how detrimental the 
replacement referee miscues have 
been to the integrity and sanctity of 
the NFL.

After the missed-call debacle in 
which a game-ending interception 
was wrongly ruled a touchdown, 
the media, especially Twitter on 
Monday Sept. 24, exploded with 
many hateful tweets — even by 
the players themselves — toward 
commissioner Roger Goodell and 
the owners who have been refusing 
to pay the referees a seemingly 
minute amount of money. 

The final amounts of the 
increase in wages, according to 
ESPN, show that the average referee 
salary increased from $149,000 
in 2011 to $173,000 in 2013, to 
as much as $205,000 by 2019. 
Considering the combined salaries 

of all of the referees, we are talking 
about millions here.

For a billion-dollar industry 
that holds the most ratings — nine 
out of the top 10 most broadcasted 
sporting events are in the NFL 
according to Nielsen Media 
Research — paying the referees 
a couple thousand more a year is 
a million dollar problem. Seems 
silly to quibble over a small raise 
when the commissioner himself 
has claimed to uphold the league’s 
badge with honor. 

When the final blown-call 
was announced in Seattle, the 
NFL’s integrity was compromised. 
An asterisk, which is noted in 
the record books to indicate to 
the public that results were not 
clean, was set upon the season. 
This three-month long lockout 
became about much more than the 
replacement referees — it became 
about the NFL not being able to 
protect its brand.

money by UCSD standards, the food 
prices are still too high when com-
pared to other campuses.

Additionally, as far as food qual-
ity goes, OVT serves essentially the 
same foods as other dining halls but 
in smaller portions, such as thinly 
sliced pizza and cut-up sub sand-
wiches. This is similar to offerings on 
other UC campuses, such as UCSC’s 
AYCE dining halls which always have 
the standard soup, entree, grains and 
starches and bakery that OVT had 
on à la carte menus. On some nights, 

OVT is planning on having special 
options, such as crab legs, which 
may be worth the increased price of 
$13.95 per person. 

But there are downsides. To set 
up for the next buffet, OVT will close 
from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 
p.m. to 5 p.m. That is four fewer 
hours that people will be able to stop 
in and eat. 

Closing hours during the day is 
typical practice for buffets — UCLA’s 
AYCE dining halls close for three 
hours during the day — but this still 
hurts after Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality cut all OVT weekend 

hours this past April. Fortunately, 
Marshall students are placed between 
a dining trifecta of Cafe Ventanas, 
Goody’s and Pines, in addition to 
three other dining halls.

While the introduction of an 
all-you-can-eat cafeteria is welcome 
and even well overdue, the campus 
should still hold onto the à la carte 
dining halls. 

It is important to have a variety of 
eating options, because no portion or 
price will fit every student.

dear Editor,
Imagine upon returning to 

campus that you read this in the 
Guardian: “Be it resolved that 
ASUCSD favor with alacrity the 
disappearance of the cancerous 
tumor known as the University of 
California San Diego. 

Relax my fellow Tritons, this 
is a hypothetical. This was never 
said by ASUCSD, nor will they ever 
come to say something that echoes 
calls for genocide so closely. But 
I do bring this to your attention 
because Iran’s president Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad said something very 
similar. He has described Israel as 
a “cancerous tumor” and he looks 
forward to its utter “disappearance.” 
You think I took that out of context? 
“The Iranian nation is standing 
for its cause [and] that is the full 
annihilation of Israel,” Iranian Chief 
of Staff Major General Seyed Hassan 
Firouzabadi said this past May. Now 
just for the sake of throwing in a 
third opinion, Iranian vice president 
Mohammed Reza Rahimi blamed 
Zionists for killing black babies and 
running the global drug trade. These 
statements are inflammatory to say 
the least and incitement to genocide 
in truth. Yet, as Americans, what do 
we care? Iran is just another religion-
based “democracy” in a region where 
that seems to be the norm.

 Wrong. Iran is not the norm, 
and is in fact far from being normal 
in how it conducts its foreign policy. 
Accompanying Iran’s threats to 
destroy Israel are Iran’s threats to 
the rest of the world. The American 
security establishment understands 
that Iran and its proxies don’t just 
threaten the very existence of the 
Jewish state, but also recognizes that 

they are just as dangerous to the 
United States and the West. Kevin 
L. Perkins, the associate deputy 
director of the FBI said recently 
that Hezbollah, Iran’s terror proxy, 
is “a significant source of concern 
for us.” Yes, that means that the 
highest echelons of the American 
intelligence communities see Iran 
as a threat to our very own national 
security. A quick glance back at the 
past few years shows Iran’s activity 
in aiding anti-American militias in 
Iraq and planning an attack on the 
Saudi ambassador to America in a 
Washington D.C. restaurant. This is 
just the beginning of the long list of 
Iran’s collision course with American 
foreign policy. Despite the serious 
nature of the aforementioned, the 
most frightening part about Iran is 
their pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
While the Iranian leadership claims 
that they intend to develop nuclear 
power, the Western world asks 
why Iran decided to bury a nuclear 
power facility hundreds of feet into a 
mountain, effectively hiding it from 
the rest of the world. As icing on the 
cake, the United Nations General 
Assembly is allowing President 
Ahmadinejad to speak before the 
international body. Are you willing 
to stand idly by as a man who incites 
genocide speaks before one of the 
most respectable organizations in the 
world? I certainly am not.

THE FIRST AMEND
MENT

Figuring out the First Amendment 
Hate speech, the failed resolution, and how UCSD should respond to words that hurt

By Mina Nilchian / Associate Focus Editor 

It’s been over two years since the Compton Cookout — a con-troversial student-organized frat 
party that played on negative stereo-
types about African-American peo-
ple, offending many and drawing 
negative media attention. It’s 2012, 
and UC campuses are still visiting 
the discussion on hate speech.

In a recent report by UC 
President Mark G. Yudof ’s Advisory 
Council on Campus Climate, 
Culture and Inclusion, the council 
described what it considered alarm-
ing instances of hate-filled speech 
against students on campus, urging 
the UC campuses to “adopt a hate 
speech-free campus policy.” (More 
information about the council and 
recommendations can be found in 
“UC President: There Will be No 
Complete Ban on Hate Speech” in 
the Sept. 25 issue of The Guardian.)

Last academic year, the council 
began gauging the campus atmo-
sphere for minority students. The 
recommendations from the report 
on campus climate for Jewish stu-
dents has drawn criticism from free 
speech advocates who believe they 
would violate the First Amendment, 
if enacted.

The July 9 report defines anti-
Semitism, cites instances of it on UC 
campuses, and asks campus admin-
istrators “to seek opportunities to 
prohibit hate speech on campus.”

“While many campuses have 
adopted hate-free campaigns or 
issued commitments affirming the 
free and open exchange of ideas 
while maintaining a civil and sup-

portive community,” the report says, 
“UC does not have a hate-free policy 
that allows the campus to prevent 
well-known bigoted and hate orga-
nizations from speaking on cam-
pus.” 

The report urges Yudof to man-

date that the UC administration 
strictly define and ban all instances 
of anti-Semitic hate speech.

The council specifically cited 
events such as “Israeli Apartheid 
Week” or “Justice in Palestine Week” 
as a source of aforementioned anti-

Semitic rhetoric that often leaves 
students feeling unsafe and target-
ed. Students reported being denied 
involvement in groups because of 
their associations with Israel, while 
another student reported the Star of 
David being called a “hate symbol.” 

Ben Hass, president of UCSD’s 
Tritons for Israel, stated that he 
agrees with the report’s claim that 
anti-Semitic speech is prevalent 
among political discussion around 
Israel.

“Not all speech against Israel is 
anti-Semitism,” Hass said.  “But call-
ing for the destruction of Israel and 
the delegitimization of Israel, that’s 
hate speech,”

Hass provided examples — 
instances in which students on cam-
pus advocated for the destruction 
of Israel, questioned its right to 
exist and compared members of the 
Israeli government to Nazis — of 
speech that alienated Jewish stu-
dents. 

Foundation for Individual Rights 
in Education, or FIRE, an organiza-
tion that has confronted the UC 
system and UCSD for alleged viola-
tions of the First Amendment — 
wrote a letter to UC President Yudof 
in August, asking him to “reject [the 
council’s] misguided and illiberal 
recommendation” on grounds that 
the report’s recommendations vio-
late the First Amendment. Citing 
cases which set the precedent of 
hate speech in the United States, it 
condemned the council for its “con-
tempt for the First Amendment.”

William Creeley, FIRE’s Director 

of Legal and Public Advocacy and 
author of the letter, spoke to The 
Guardian about the issue of hate 
speech on campus. He says the ban 
does more than just violate the First 
Amendment. 

“The answer to ‘hate speech’ is 
always more speech and not censor-
ship,” Creeley said.

FIRE has given UCSD’s speech 
policy a “red rating,” indicating that 
it has at least one policy that unam-
biguously suppresses free speech. 
The organization extensively cov-
ered the events surrounding the 
Compton Cookout. 

The party, and its association 
with UCSD-affiliated organizations, 
raised the issue of minority repre-
sentation in the UC system.

Community outrage heightened 
after UCSD’s controversial humor 
publication The Koala defended the 
party, as well as other controversial 
events, which included the discov-
ery of a noose at Geisel Library 
shortly after the party.

Creeley explained that the same 
rhetoric that FIRE used to defend 
The Koala’s actions should be 
applied to the issue of anti-Semitism 
on UC campuses.

“Those types of affronts must be 
answered by dialogue. They can be 
decried. They can be debated. They 
can be exposed,” Creeley explained. 
“When you ban ideas, you give them 
a mysterious power and you imbue 
them with authority that they don’t 
otherwise have.”

Yudof said in a Sept. 19 interview 
that the report’s recommendations 

on banning hate speech would not 
be put to a vote by UC adminis-
tration for the same reasons that 
Creeley discussed in the letter. 

U.S. courts have found that the 
First Amendment will not protect 
speech that threatens and incites, 
allowing the UC administration to 
prohibit and punish speech in the 
form of harassment.

But when it comes to words that 
offend, many believe the adminis-
tration shouldn’t stay silent. Creeley 
urges that the administration exer-
cise its own First Amendment right.

“I think life in a modern liberal 
democracy can be very challenging 
for many. At times our most deeply 
held beliefs are challenged and we’ll 
find ourselves deeply offended by 
the ideas that we encounter,” Creeley 
said. “We think that as always the 
idea is to facilitate more dialogue 
to work to foster understanding via 
continued debate and discussion.”

Hass, who also insists he sup-
ports the First Amendment and 
the students’ right to free speech, 
believes the right response by 
administration in dealing with the 
anti-Semitic atmosphere on campus 
is by consistently administering its 
own response to said speech.

“We’re not saying that hate 
speech shouldn’t be allowed. We 
want the administration to con-
demn it,” Hass said. “I think the 
other stuff [in the report] is not as 
important as getting the adminis-
tration to acknowledge that there is 
hate speech and anti-Semitism.”

“ I think life in a modern liberal democracy can 
be very challenging for 
many. At times our most 
deeply held beliefs are 
challenged and we’ll 
find ourselves deeply 
offended by the ideas 
that we encounter,” 
Creeley said. “We think 
that as always the idea 
is to facilitate more 
dialogue to work to 
foster understanding via 
continued debate and 
discussion.”

Political Preference Found to Have Genetic Basis
It’s In Your Genes

HUMAN ELEMENT

Just in time for election season, UCSD researchers have revealed 
some very interesting information 
about voting patterns. As the cam-
paigns of both President Barack 
Obama and Republican presidential 
candidate Mitt Romney intensify, 
professors at UCSD are tapping into 
what could be a powerful impetus 
behind an individual’s political ideol-
ogy — DNA.

That human genetics could have a 
part in our political disposition isn’t 
as far-fetched as it may seem. 

“Gene expression affects neu-
rotransmitters, which affects person-
ality, which affects political behav-
ior,” said UCSD Professor James 
Fowler in an interview for the web-
site Doctor’s Lounge. 

As nineteenth-century geneticist 
Sir Francis Galton recognized, gene 
sequences play a significant part in 
a person’s personality and character 
qualities, so it’s not hard to see how 
this can play into political behavior. 

“A person who feels strongly 
about pro-life or anti-abortion could 
have a very strong urge to survive 
and procreate due to their DNA 
sequences,” Fowler said.

Researchers and political scien-
tists have been studying how genetic 
combinations can affect political 
and social behavior. For the past 
eight years, researchers have exam-
ined the correlation between gene 
patterns and behavior to see just 

how strongly DNA can influence 
ideology. Professor Peter Hatemi, an 
associate professor of microbiology, 
biochemistry and political science at 
Pennsylvania State University, along 
with Brown University political sci-
ence professor Rose McDermott, 
have worked on this research and 
compiled information gathered from 
numerous experiments.

 In one, researchers studied sets 
of identical and fraternal twins over 
time to determine the similarity of 
their political preferences. The data 
indicated that though identical twins 
followed similar political patterns 
into adulthood, there was greater 
variation between fraternal twins. 

“Genes can determine one’s ide-
ology and political participation,” 
Professor Fowler said. “For identical 
twins, who share 100 percent of their 
genes, their views tend to stay the 
same versus a set of fraternal twins, 
who only share half of their genes.”

Genetic makeup isn’t the only 
thing that affects political ideology. 
Family and environment play an 
important role, and can result in 
vast variations in thought or action. 
According to Hatemi and his team, 
party identification is strongly affect-
ed by upbringing and family tradi-
tions, while political ideology such 
as liberal or conservative views are 
affected by genetics. This means that 
someone with a liberal mindset on 
current issues, can still see himself 

or herself as a conservative because 
their family is right-leaning. Hence 
the millions of young people who 
support gay marriage and abortion 
but consider themselves Republican. 

Who and what you surround 
yourself with can affect your behav-
ior as well. 

“Social networks are extremely 
powerful, and I do think that envi-
ronment will have an effect, even 
with the strength of genetic influ-
ence,” said Fowler. “On the other 
hand, one of the interesting things is 
that people don’t change their minds 
too much. [Political behavior] is a 
very stable trait. This is why often 
people will still stick to the same 
viewpoint even if presented with 
strong evidence to support the oppo-
site side.”

The influences of DNA do not 
reach their high point until a person 
has reached between 21 and 25 years 
of age, which is when many young 
adults leave their parents’ homes. 

“The family environment is so 
strong that it overrides any genet-
ic similarity,” Hatemi told Doctor’s 
Lounge. “But when you leave home 
you go your own path.”

So if you find that your views have 
suddenly leaned towards the right 
after leaving your Democrat family, 
or you are cheering at a Republican 
rally even if you don’t intend to vote 
for Mitt Romney, it might be because 
of your genes.

Third World to Impact Global Competition
world countries” — rather than being 
identified as individual nations sug-
gests the lack of respect afforded to 
them. The common population usu-
ally doesn’t recognize that Eritreans 
tend to be strong distance runners, 
Uruguayans strong soccer players and 
Grenadians strong sprinters. Instead, 
these nations are pooled as one body. 
This uneven grouping allows nations 
from low socio-economic countries 
to be discounted and largely ignored 
for their individual talents (Jamaica 
being an obvious exception).

Take Botswana, for example. A 
quiet country in southern Africa, 
Botswana has, in recent years, 
spawned some of the best track and 
field athletes in the world. Amantle 
Montsho, a track and field athlete 

from Mabudutsa, Botswana, has not 
only won the World Championships 
in the 400 meter — beating out 
big names like Sanya Richards and 
Allyson Felix — she placed fourth 
in the Olympic Games. Nigel Amos, 
from Marobela Village, Botswana, 
got silver in the 800 meter at the 
Olympics this summer. The country 
also sponsors a rapidly improving 
soccer team that is rising amongst 
international competition. Yet many 
Americans don’t even know that 
Botswana is a country, let alone that 
it has runners and soccer players that 
may push first world countries out of 
contention for Olympic medals in the 
near future.

Kirani James, Felix Sanchez, 
Danuta Kozak and Tirunesh Dibaba 
are just a few of dozens of athletes 
from economically inferior countries 

that are winning medals at the inter-
national level. But for some reason, 
the countries they represent remain 
to be ignored as potential athletic 
powerhouses.

The reasons for this are myriad 
and complex — racism, or the focus 
on a country’s wealth as the sole 
source of its value could be possible 
culprits. But despite the cause of it 
being ignored, the fact that many 
countries are emerging from the shad-
ows into the forefront of international 
athletic performance will eventually 
be unable to be ignored. By paying 
attention to the media’s treatment of 
these countries and demanding to be 
acknowledged by the Olympic com-
mittee and other governing bodies, 
the realm of international athletic 
competition can truly become a place 
of respect and equal opportunity.

The Chico State Wildcats came 
into their game against the Tritons 
after hosting four consecutive CCAA 
victories at home. Sitting confi-
dently in first place in the CCAA, 
the Wildcats warmed up to take on 
the Tritons (4-1), and proceeded to 
struggle in an unfamiliar atmosphere.

Into the first set, UCSD fell 21-25, 
but bounced back with a dominant 
performance in the sets to come. 
In the second set, Chico suffered 
from 14 service and attack errors 
giving UCSD an edge to close out 
the set with a score of 25-18. Early 
in the third set, sophomore Amber 
Hawthorne delivered two service aces 
to spark a 15-point Triton rally to 
top Chico 25-12. The Tritons closed 
out the game with a last set score of 
25-16, improving their record to 4-1.

Defensively, UCSD had a great 
game at the net, with nine block-
ing assists from sophomore Lauren 
Demos and four apiece from fresh-
man Sheridan Taylor and sophomore 
Amber Hawthorne. Together, UCSD 
combined for 13 total team blocks to 
Chico’s two.

Hawthorne controlled the tempo 
of the Triton offense with 40 assists. 
UCSD totaled 45 kills, a number of 
which were from sophomore Sara 
McCutchan, who had 13, and fresh-
man Danielle Dahle, who led UCSD 
once again with 14 kills. 

Freshman Sophie Rowe also had 
a solid performance leading UCSD in 
the third set to a 10-point run against 
the Wildcats. Rowe had seven kills and 
nine digs in the three sets she played 
where UCSD bested Chico.

The following night, on Sept. 27, 
UCSD defeated Cal State Stanislaus 

(1-5) in three sets.
Stanislaus took an early lead in the 

first set, but UCSD soon found pace 
and rallied back, led by underclassmen 
Rowe and Dahle. The Tritons took the 
win with scores of 25-22, 25-10, and 
25-21.

Highlights on the offensive side 
include 14 more kills from Dahle. 
Defensively, Demos, McCutchan and 
Taylor had three blocks each, while 
freshman libero Katy Woodward and 
Sophie Rowe tallied 21 digs each.

After failing to win in their confer-
ence debut against Dominguez Hills, 
volleyball has won five consecutive 
games to put the team in a running for 
first place in the Central Coast Athletic 
Association. 

“Our win streak is great. It’s defi-
nitely firing the team up to perform 
this weekend as we travel to Sonoma 
and San Francisco State,” Hawthorne 
said in an email interview. “The way 
we have been playing recently has been 
very impressive, but not surprising.” 

The Tritons have proven them-
selves a talented group of under-
classmen that have gone through the 
gauntlet. 

“We may be a young squad, but we 
have a lot of talent that is setting us up 
for a successful season,” Hawthorne 
said. “As long as we continue the hard 
work and focus every time we are on 
the court, I think we will be the team 
to beat this year.“ 

Next week, on Oct. 5, UCSD heads 
north to take on No. 24 Sonoma 
State. The Tritons will also face San 
Francisco State who are in a four-way 
tie with UCSD, Sonoma State, and Cal 
State San Bernardino for the top rank 
in the CCAA.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 1,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Bouncing into track practice last 
month in the midst of Olympic track 
competition, grin plastered across my 
face, brimming with Botswana patri-
otism and pride, I dashed up to my 
friends and fellow athletes. In the irri-
tatingly high-pitched voice I get when 
I’m too excited, I squealed, “Two run-
ners from Botswana might win med-
als in the Olympics!” I had found out 
the night before when my heavily-
accented Setswana mother called me 

in a nearly epileptic fit of excitement 
at the news. I looked around at the 
bemused faces of my running bud-
dies. After an uncomfortable silence, 
one ventured a hesitant reply.

“Oh, Botswana...you mean that 
place in Asia, right?”

Um, no. 
“Botswana’s in southern Africa. 

Y’know, where my family’s from.”
Suddenly, their faces lit up with 

the confidence that comes with feel-
ing that one knows what’s being talk-
ed about. 

“Oh, well yeah, Africans are all 
good runners.”

Unfortunately, this occurrence is 
all too common when talking about 
athletes from third-world countries. 
Third world nations are seeing an 
impressive emergence in high-level 
competitive sports and are prov-
ing themselves to be athletic pow-
erhouses despite being written off 
as too hungry and too poor to be 
real threats. Because of their lack of 
money, which affords them “third-
world” status, they are not graced 
with the amount of respect or rec-
ognition they deserve. This year, the 
Summer Olympics acted as a global 
stage to throw the Western world’s 
view of third-world countries as des-
titute and powerless into question 
as they challenged richer countries’ 
athletes in the battle for medals; 
however, these countries still suffer 
the lack of respect caused by being 
lumped together with all other third-
world nations instead of as individual 
entities.

Olympic commentary is a clear 
example of this. Whereas richer 
Western countries are afforded indi-
viduality — you hear “The United 
States has a great track team,” not 
“North Americans run well” — third-
world countries are lumped together 
into broad, homogeneous groups. 
For example, in an Aug. 12 article 
reporting the results for the mara-
thon, Bleacher Report’s Mike Hoag Jr. 
stated, “Three Africans set the pace, 
and all three took the hardware in 
the men’s marathon...” There are 54 
individual countries in Africa, with 
diverse cultures, languages, econo-
mies and, yes, sports teams. Yet when 
written about, all 54 nations are con-
sidered one big, third-world mass.

It is true that track and soccer 
are sports in which it is acknowl-
edged that low socio-economic coun-
tries perform well. However, the 
fact that they are lumped together 
in one homogenous group —“third

The UCSD Women’s Soccer team went into weekend com-petition ranked No. 5 in the 
nation. But after a draw with CSU 
Dominguez Hills last Friday, Sept. 
28, and a 1-0 overtime loss to CSU 
San Bernardino on Sunday, Sept. 30, 
UCSD will be lucky to remain in the 
top 20.

On Sunday, tied 0-0 with one 
minute left to play in the first over-
time period, the Tritons gave up a 
free kick 25 yards from their own 
goal. 

CSU San Bernardino’s Michelle 
Bagheri sent a well-struck ball into 
the penalty area. Coyote forward 
Urbano Carmona — man-marked 
by Triton defender Britnee Chesney 
for the entire match — found breath-
ing room in the box, and was able 
to redirect it past freshman keeper 
Kelcie Brodsky.

The golden goal marked the end 
of the Tritons’ unbeaten streak.

“We needed a wakeup call, and 
this was a big time wakeup call,” 
UCSD Head Coach Brian McManus 
said. “We’ve got a whole eight games 
to go, a new season to play for and we 
just have to hope now that we make 
the CCAAs.”

McManus may be blowing up his 
team’s homestand skid, but it’s defi-
nitely a change from last season. In 
2011, UCSD went 12 straight games 
without a loss.

On Friday, the Tritons settled for a 
1-1 tie against CSU Dominguez Hills. 
UCSD’s only goal came from senior 
forward Gabi Hernandez, who was 

able to poke the ball past the Toro 
keeper to give the Tritons a short-
lived lead. 

Dominguez equalized just eight 
minutes later off a well-placed shot 
past Brodsky. 

“We are very fortunate to come 
away with the tie,” McManus said 
to the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We weren’t working hard enough. 
We would not win the tackles, and we 
just didn’t believe in ourselves when 
we got the ball.”

Consecutive low-scoring 
campaigns for the Tritons 
may expose some holes 
in this year’s roster. 
The Tritons cer-
tainly miss the 
outright speed 
and athleticism 
of graduated forward Sarah McTigue, 
who ended her playing career at 
UCSD with 28 goals and 14 assists.

Now serving the Tritons as an 
assistant coach, McTigue says the 
Tritons need to regain their confi-
dence in the front line.

“I don’t think we have anything to 
worry about,” McTigue said. “I think 
we just need to get our confidence 
back in our attack, and the goals will 
come.”

The Tritons head up North for a 
two-game road trip, starting with a 
match against Humboldt State, this 
Friday Oct. 5 followed by a game 
against San Francisco State on Oct. 7.

Off to the best start in recent mem-
ory, the Tritons 5-1-2 have claimed 
the top spot in the CCAA with two 
consecutive wins this weekend. 

Senior forward Evan Walker netted 
two goals for the Tritons last weekend, 
on Sept. 28 and 30 in UCSD’s home-
stand.

On Sunday, in a bout against CCAA 
South opponent CSU San Bernardino, 
Walker broke free down the left side-
line to slot the ball past Coyote keep-
er Tanner Olinger. Up 1-0, the game 
remained tight as the play remained in 
the middle of the park.

In a textbook display of team 
defense, the Tritons plugged the cen-
ter of the field, leaving little oppor-
tunity for the Coyotes in the attack 
in the second half. Junior forward 
Tsuk Haroush stood as the lone strik-
er in the attack, while the remainder 
of the Tritons stayed largely behind 
the ball. Managing his substitutions 

well, UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale 
kept the legs fresh on the field, as the 
Tritons sent in eight substitutions in 
the first half alone.

“The defense has been great from 
our goalkeeper to our back four. We’ve 
played a lot of different guys in there,” 
Jon Pascale said. “We’ve really done 
it by committee. It’s great to have that 
many guys you can trust and get the 
job done.”

With the clock winding down 
the game opened up, as CSU San 
Bernardino pushed to attack in search 
of the equalizer — neither team orga-
nizing an attack, but both squads capi-
talizing on mistakes and rushing the 
goal in the transition.

The Tritons cemented the win with 
10 minutes left when freshman mid-
fielder Elan Gefen took the ball down 
to the left corner. Gefen struck a long 
flighted ball to the opposite goal post 
to find junior transfer Will Pleskow, 
who sent a header into the back of the 
net. Demonstrating the depth of the 
incoming freshmen, the goal marked 

Pleskow’s first goal and Gefen’s first 
assist.

“The second goal was just three 
or four good decisions,” Pascale said. 
“The right pass and the right runs and 
everything just added up.”

On Friday night, the Tritons fought 
for a 1-0 advantage midway into the 
first half over CCAA South Division 
squad CSU Dominguez Hills, and held 
onto the lead to scrape by with the win.

In the 21st minute, senior mid-
fielder Alex Portela lifted the ball into 
the center of the 18-yard box to find 
the head of senior forward Walker.

Walker struck the ball into the 
upper right hand corner to net the 
game winner as well as the senior’s first 
goal of the season.

 “That was a really good team we 
beat tonight,” UCSD Head Coach Jon 
Pascale said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “[They were] the best 
attacking players that we’ve seen so far.”

Needing a goal to equalize, 
Dominguez Hills went on the attack 
from there, while the Tritons were 
content to protect their 1-0 lead.

In the second half, UCSD was out-
shot by the Toros 10-1, putting true 
freshman, goalkeeper Scott McElfresh, 
to the test. 

In his first full game, McElfresh 
made four big stops to keep the net 
clean for UCSD.

Ten games into the 2012 season, 
the Tritons have only allowed three 
goals, and only one goal in CCAA play. 

UCSD heads back on the road to 
face Sonoma State, next week, Oct. 
5, in Ronhert Park. A win against the 
Seawolves — ranked second in the 
CCAA North Division — would put 
the Tritons solidly at the top of the
