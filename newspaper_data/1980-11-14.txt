Marijuana part of 
Med School study 

The UCSD School of 
Medicine will begin dolling 
out marijuana cigarette and 
THC cap ules next month-
a part of a plan to test the 
drug's effect on cancer 
patients undergoing chemo-
therapy and radiation 
treatment. 

The UCSD School of Medicine will begin a test program using marijuana for cancer patients 
next month. T he active ingredient in marijuana, THe, has been shown to reduce nausea 
associated with chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer. 

Spon ored by the Re earch 
Advisory Panel of the state of 
California, a board created by 
the Legislature 10 years ago 
to oversee medical research 
programs, the tudy aims at 
determining which cancer 
patients will respond to 
marijuana's anti -nausea 
effects, and the ideal dosage 
for patients_ Earlier studies 
have shown that marijuana 
may help reduce nau ea in

A coordinator for the UC 
Student Lobby will visit 
UCSD Monday to inform 
students of their rights in 
collective bargaining with 
the university. 

Allan Dailey, Collective 
Bargaining Training Coordi-
nator for the Lobby will 
speak at 11 am in the North 
Conference Room of the 
Student Center. He will tell of 
the new rights students have 
in the making of their 
contracts with the univer-
sity. 

Under the recently-
approved Higher Education 
Employer-Employee Rela-
tions Act, students are 
allowed to sit in on employee 
contract negotiations with 
the university_ Dailey has 
been hired by the Student 
Body President's Council and 
the UC Student Lobby to 
educate students about 
collective bargaining and to 
develop a UC-wide network 
of campus collective 
bal"gaining committees. 

These committees will 
consist of interested and 
qualified studen ts who will 
develop working relation-

ships with union officials on 
campus and employee 
relations personnel. They 
will also monitor campus 
unfair practice charges and 
union organizing campaigns 
and educate themselves 
regarding the collective 
bargaining process. 

Mitch Sosna, co-director of 
the UCSD Lobby Annex, says 
that Dailey will "discuss the 
impact of this new legislation 
and how students can relate 
to it." He adds that students 
have "the advantage to start 
preparations now so that we 
will be better prepared when 
(negotiation) committee are 
formed." 

The AS will be in charge of 
forming the student 
collective bargaining 
committee on campus. Sosna 
estimates that the committee 
will begin work during 
winter quarter. 

Marco LiMandri, president 
of the California State 
Employees Association local 
on campus, expressed 
support for student input in 
the negotiations process but 
indicated that he felt 
students would hold "pro-
management" positions on 
most issues. 

SacraInento interns 
can file with ASIO 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
A.eoclate New. Editor 

Applications for newly-
created internships in 
Sacramento are now being 
accepted at the Associated 
Students Internship Office. 

Beginning this spring, 
tudents will have the 

opportunity to spend an 
academic quarter or summer 
in Sacramento. Internships 
in Washington, DC, and San 
Diego · are also available 
through ASIO. 

Internships at county, 
state and federal government 
levels with senator or 
assemblymen, in journalism 
and with variou associa-
tions and lobby groups, are 

currently available at ASIO, 
located on the second floor of 
the Student Center. 

Up to 16 units of academic 
credit for an internship are 
possible. Although some 
positions offered through the 
program are paid, the cost for 
a quarter in Sacramento can 
be as much as $1200. 

"Interns in Sacramento get 
more responsibility and more 
atten tion than tho e in the

r-----------------~--------Weinglas, noted lawyer, 
to speak on NAASCO 

One of the nation's most 
prominent progressive 
lawyers, Leonard Wein-
glass, will appear at UCSD 
Tuesday to speak on "Civil 
Rights in the 'SO's - An 
Attack Against One Is an 
Attack Against All." 

The program is sponsored 
by the San Diego committee 
to Defend the NASSCO 
Workers, the Associated 
Students, the Third World 
Studies Program, and the 
San Diego Students for 
Peace. 

The program begins at 7 
pm in USB 2722. 

Weinglass played an 
active role in the civil ri~hts 
movement of the late 60s 
and '70s and was involved 

in the defense of such well-
known cases as Angela 
Davis, the Chicago Seven 
and Russell Means (Woun-
ded Knee). Weinglass is 
currently a part of the legal 
team defending the 
NASSCO three - David 
Boyd, Clyde Leo and Rodney 
Johnson. All were shipyard 
workers for the National 
Steel and Shipbuilder's 
Company, were arrested on 
Sept. 16 during a workers 
strike at NASSCO on 
charges of conspiring to 
bomb the shipyard and 
failure to register destruc-
tive devices. 

If convicted, each could 
face up to 35 years in prison. 

are expected to participate in 
the program. 

The National Cancer 
Institute, which i respon-
sible for distributin 
marijuana for experimenta 
tion, will upply the drug for 
the tate program. UCSD 
expects their order to arrive 
late this month. 

Patient selected to receive 
the drug must be undergoing 
cancer treatment which 
causes nau eousness, and 
have failed to obtain nausea 
relief with standard 
medication_ Pregnant women 
and patients with a history of 
heart disease or psychologi-
cal illne s are not eligible for 
the study. 

The drug will be given to 
participants in capsules of 
tetrahydro-cannibinol 
(THC), marijuana's active 
ingredient, or in orne cases, 
in cigarette form . Those 
patients using marijuana 
cigarettes must already be 
experienced in its use, and 
will be hospitalized during 
usage, since its dose is less 
consistent than the THC 
capsules_ Participants taking 
capsules may do so as 
outpatients or while 
hospitalized. 

William Stanton, assistant 
clinical professor of medicine 
and a principal investigator 
for the Research Advisory 
Panel said, "I'm concerned 
about creating expectations 
in patients which cannot be 
met by this program. It is not 
a program which makes 
marijuana or THC readily 
available to all eligible cancer 
patients, ince federal 
government supply of the 
experimental drug is limited. 
The California Research 
Advisory Patlel, however, is 
looking into ways of 
supplying the dru~ ~ mo~e 
patients can partIcIpate In 
the study." 

Stanton said that patients 
interested in participating in 
the study should contact 
their cancer physicians 
regarding participation in the 
program. All cancer special-
ists in California have been

Yet another voice 
for Germaine Greer 
Editor: 

Lika Lee is revealing of 
herself when in her letter 
(TIu Daily GlUlrdia" Nov. 
10). She criticizes Gennaine 
Greer's presentation with an 
eloquent, "you must have 
seen it to believe it." 
Unfortunately, Lee forgot to 

lis~. 
To call Greer a charlatan 

because she does not hold in 
awe the New York art scene 
or the capitalist'corporate 
hand in the art world is to be 
naive about that particular 
pooression and reification ' 
that limits not only female 
artists but all people. That is 
where Greer solidly aims her 
disdain. 

As for collecting, which Lee 
confuses altogether, Greer 
encourages private patro· 
nag'l! for support and love of 
the arts, rather than as 
monetary investment which 
is the exclusive determinant 
of value in advanced 
capitalism. Woman should 
celebrate that in Greer's 
search and discovery, 
paintings which would have 
been left in the shadows are 
brouJht out into the light. 

What should be on museum 
walls and in art history 
lesson should answer the 
question which ha been 
imprisoned for so long in the 
cornerstones of every 
museum and at be t, effaced 
in every art history text: why 
have there been no great 
female artists? There were-
always were, are and always 
will be- despite the 
obstacles. we have ' been 
denied , and will continue to 
be until the capitalist· 
patriarchal structure that 
determines what goes on the 
wall is revoked . 

1n no way does Greer 
advise women to make 
booties or "channel" their 
energies as Lee falsely 
interprets . Rather, she 
speaks of subversion, and 
reminds women to work 
consciously aware of how 
women before us worked, 
making beauty in the world 
where they could , whether 
within the confines of an 
imposed and rigid domestici· 
tyu, or if able, on canvases 
that found their way to 
museum basements. Art is 
never far from life, any kind 

of life, and in even the most 
wearisome of routines, 
women persist. The quilts 
Greer admires are but one of 
a variety of objects that (she 
made no mentin of booties) 
are art. To deny their 
existence is to accept the 
patriarchal definition and the 
striving of these women. 
Greer insists that we 
remember and encouraged 
female art ists to work 
outside the mainstream that 
would recuperate our work in 
a disguised patriarchy. 

Just as money begets 
money, one a painting is 

bought for a corporate 
collection, it acrues value and 
' is therefore open to more 
consideration and higher 
artistic appraisal. If that is 
the game feminists play, then 
we shall lose as artists. To 
compete with other people is 
to compete with other 
women, and to compete is to 
seek to deny. This serves no 
artistic purpose and we have 
been denied long enough. 

Greer has always advocat· 
ed a feminism that would 
create a new society from the 
gound up, after taking apart, 
layer by layer, a structure 

that dichotomizes men from 
women, race from race, class 
from class, youn from old, 
(yes, Greer is middle·aged 
which Lee implies goes hand 
in had with being a 
reactionary , a prejudice 
against age) and art from life. 
Greer's style is a personal 
one; she neither lectures nor 
reads. Her words come freely 
as if in conversation, and she 
makes a loose statement now 
and then. Don't we all? She is 
no charlatan. Charlatans are 
out there, firmly established 
in their power in the art

but they fail miserably to 
realize that for dirt·poor 
sharecroppers in the 3Os, 
sending children to school

Labeling the characters 
"narrow·minded" is a rather 
harsh generalization . I 
suppose you would be 
ecstatic if you hadn't eaten a 
meal in over a month, right? 
These people are piss·poor-
all their energies go toward

Bus letters continue to roll in 
Editor: 

I feel outraged and pushed' 
around after reading that the' 
administration announced 
its plan for the removal of 
buses from campus. I believe 
the administratIon was very 
unjust and extremely 
shortsighted in their call to 
remove the buses. 

I don't know which 
administrator(s) called for 
the move due to noise 
pollution, but he or she ought 
to ride the bus someday-it 
might be a humbling 
experience. Sure the bus is 
loud, but one must realize the 
far out·weighing positive 
aspects of the San Diego 
County bus system. Not only 
do the buses manage to save 
thousands of people from the 
trap of either owmng a car or 
being stuck in car·pools, but 
they do so with fairly good 
timing and extreme care and 
thoughtfulness. In my own 
ca e, the North County bus 
service was a major factor in 
moving to the location that I 
did , since I felt that I could 
depend on using it to get to 
choo!. 

In my opinion there are 
three apparent solutions to 
our (administration's) 
problem. One: get rid of the 
buses (absurdity); two: 
provide more on (or close·to) 
campus living alternatIves; 
or, three: stop spending 
research money on defense 
contracts and build buses 
that are quieter and get 
better gas mileage.

If the administration at 
UCSD thinks that it can 
simply play with and shift 
around the daily activities of 
many persons (without any 
prior diSCUSSIon of the 

matter) then it is obvious to 
me that they are not working 
for the best interest of the 
student population.

Guardian missed out on 
high school event here 
Editor: 

A significant event 
occurred on campus on 
Saturday, Nov. 8, and I'm 
upset that it wasn't covered 
in your newspaper. Anyone 
out on Revene Plaza at 
various times during the day 
couldn't have missed it, yet it 
managed to escape the 
attention of The Daily 
GUllrdion. 

Approximately 330 stu· 
dents from 13 high schools 
descended on UCSD for our 
first annual Model United 
Nations High School 
Conference. For nearly six 
hours of deliberations, these 
students represented 74 
nations on four large 
committees and two smaller 
ones. They debated, 
caucused and ultimately 
produced resolutions on 
topics actually considered by 
the United Nations in New 
York, such as the transfer of 
technology and Israeli 
practices in the occupied 
territories. This was a great 
learning experience for the

delegates as well as for the 
UCSD students who served 
as officers of the committees. 
The high school teachers 
who advised the delegations 
said that this conference was 
one of the finest they had 
been to and that it was better 
run and organized than some 
other conferences that have 
been running for 10 or 12 
years. 

A school newspaper should 
cover a major event by a 
student organization, 
especially when such an 
event can make a favorable 
impression on hundreds of 
prospective freshmen . Who 
can forget the threat of 

fallin~ enrollments and 
UCSD s attrition rate? I can 
only hope that the Guarditln 
will give next year's

and his tendency to analyze 
the consequences of any 
action. With such a 
disposition , Hamlet sees 
every action full of 
reverberations and finds 
taking action difficult. He 
also realizes that his 
philosophizing is causing 
hesitation where he should 
be taking quick action, and 

this is one source of his 
torment. Bennett also makes 
his Hamlet a man who 
derives intellectual satisfac-

of why Hamlet cannot take

Comic, serious acts are mixed 
"An Evening of Improvisational 

Theatre," featuring Victor and 
Goldberg, is offered at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art Nov. 
20 (Thursday) at 8 pm. 

The team of Victor and Goldberg, 
a stand·up comedy duo with an 
inter-racial twist, performs an hour-
long program of improvisational 

~ork~ rangin~ from ~omic 
sItuations to senous expenments 
with the traditional forms of 
theatrical presentation. 

Whoopi Goldberg grew up in New 
York and later attended New York 

University and Emerson College in 
Boston, After studying with Uta 
Hagen, she came to San Diego where 
she met Don Victor. The two soon 
become a comedy improvisation 
team. 

Together they have performed at 
the San Diego Rep, the Gaslamp 
Quarter Theater, the Marquis and 
the California Pacific Theater. 

Admission to the performance is 
$3. Tickets are available at the door 
or can be obtained in advance from 
the Museum at 700 Prospect Street 
in La Jolla. 

Gospel, jazz, folk and blues are 
delivered in the powerful tradition 
of black vocal music by Sweet 
Honey in the Rock, a group of four 
women scheduled to perform on 
campus at 7 pm, Nov. 25 
(Thursday). 

The group will perform in the HL 
Auditorium. Admission is free. 

"Anyone expecting just to boogie 
or hear a few spirituals is in {or a 
surprise," wrote Ms, Magazine 
critIC Susan McHenry after a 
performance by the group. "Their 
music pulls at you, demanding ome 
deeper response, a more conscious 
commlUnent than applau e." 

Bernice Johnson Reagon, Evelyn 
Har'ri , Tulani L.C. Jordan and 
Yasmeen Williams now form the 

group founded by l{eagon in 1972, 
when she was the vocal director of 
the D.C. Black Repertory Theater. 
Reagon has a Ph.D. in history and is 
the director of the Program in Black 
American Culture at the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

The group, calls its performance a 
"song shop, 'sincetheprogramgoe 
beyond entertainment to provide a 
lesson on black culture, history and 
human rights, Sweet Honey's songs 
range from old-time spirituals and 
preaching songs to original material 
about current social and political 
problems. The quartet sings a 
capella with complex harmonie . 
creating phraSIng , intricate 
rhythms and hand-clapping 

their vocals.

Iran oil 
attacked 

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) 
- Iran's oil refining center, 
Abadan, came under renewed 
Iraqi artillery and air attacks 
yesterday, Tehran Radio 
reported. The Iranian 
news agency Pars also 
reported fighting among pro-
Iraqi groups in SC!nandaj, a 
Kurdish-Populated city in 
western Iran. 

A UN peace·seeking envoy 
to visit Iran and Iraq next 
week said his mission will be 
to gather information rather 
than conduct negotiations 
and will not include any 
discussion of the American 
hostages in Iran. 

The envoy, former Prime 
Minister Olof Palme of 
Sweden, leader of the 
Socialist Party there, said in 
Stockholm "there are deep- · 
rooted differences between 
these nations and one can 
not expect rapid results." 

Palme said he would confer 
in New York with UN 
Sec retary -G·eneral Kurt 
Waldheim later this week, 
then fly to Geneva , 
Switzerland on Sunday 
before heading for Tehran 
and then Baghdad. 

In _ Iraq. Information 
Minister Nazar Samurai said 
Palme "is welcome to visit 
Baghdad apy time." He 
referred to a statemen t 
Mqnday by Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein welcoming 
third party efforts to end the 
war, now in its eighth week. 

Hussein has offered to 
withdraw all Iraqi forces 
from Iran as soon as Tehran 
accepts Iraq's demands for a 
revision of the existing 
border treaty and recognize 
Iraqi sovereignty over the 
Shatt aI-Arab waterway. 

In New York, American 
UN Ambassador William 
vanden Heuvel described the 
Palme mission as "a step in 
the right direction." 

Cuban Foreign Minister 
Isidoro Malmierca and 
Palentinia n L·iberation 
Organization chief Yasser 
Ar afat .met in Beirut , 
Lebanon, to explore possibili· 
ties of an Iran-Iraq cease·fire, 
according to the Palestinian 
new ap;en'cy WAF A. 

'Bonzo' 
ntadne'ss 

HOLLYWOOD (AP) -
Ronald Reagan's election to 
the presidency could mean 
big bucks for Bonzo - at 
least that's the hope of the 

. two men who created the 
chimpanzee character tht co-
starred with Reagan in the 
1951 film, " Bedtime for 
Bonzo ... · 

The basis for a Bonzo craze 
already exists, as evidenced 
by a New York fan club, the 
long lines of visitors to t he 
original 8()nzo's gravesite, 
Bonzo film festivals and the 
Bonzobilia already available 
- not only a poster with 
Reagan from the film, but 
suspenders, belts, baseball 
caps and belt buckles. 

But the avalanche of 
merchandise may just be 
starting. In the works are 
plans for a Bonzo doll, pillow 
cases, sheets. china, um· 
brellas and much more. 

There's also talk of a Bonzo 
comic strip, a cartoon show 
and possible TV guest spots.

1M football gears for post season play 
BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 

There weren't many surprise upsets last weekend when 
intramural football playoffs finished their first week, but 
since each team is getting closer to claiming the 
championship, the competition is getting tougher, 

At least that's the way most playoffs progress, but with 
teams that have names like Q-Ludatics, Suck Muck Dicks 
o and Unbeat Meat, one wonders what the teams' intents 
are. 

Rtgardless of their intents, all teams have games to play 
this weekend. 

The quarterfinal rounds will be played this weekend in 
the Men's AA and A l~es and in the Coed A leagues. In 
the men's MA, the semi-finals are to take place, and in the 
Coed AA the championship game will be played. 

As was expected. there are some lopsided match ups. A 
few others may very well decide who's going to win the 
championship. To avoid making predictions this week, the 
Budman and the Czar have gone into a temporary one-week 
retirement. To get a line on this week s games and a 
glimpse into the future, Tiu Daily Guardia" had to go to 
Jimmy the Geek. 

As for the Geek being an authority on UCSD football , 
that waits to be seen until after the games are over. For . 
now;-here's now the games are favored to go this weekend:

Ordlnlry People: Rooert Redford 
couldn't have picked a better movie 
tor his directorial debut than this 
adaptation of Judith Guest's novel. 
Mary Tyler Moore and Donald 
Sutherland are almost perfect as 
husband and wife in a 'Wealthy mid-
western family that is slowly 
disintegrating under the pressure 
caused by the death of a favorite son. 
The best scenes, though, belong to 
Timothy Hutton, \/IIho plays the 
younger son who feels responsible 
tor his brother's death, and Judd 
Hirsch, who plays Hutton 's 
psychiatrist. 

The EmpIre StrIca IMk: The 
malevolent Darth Vader is back with a 
plan to lure Luke Sk'ywalker into the 
Empire's fold in this sequel to George 
lucas' StI, W... While Sk'ywalker 
and Vader are on a collision course, 
the other good guys - Hans Solo, the 
Princess, the Wookiee and droids -
try to evade the Empire's net without 
much success. The film is much better 
technically than its predecessor, but 
its semi-Cliffhanger ending seems a lot 
to ask with a three-year wait between 
chapters in the Star W .. serial.

Somcwhcrc In TIMe: Christopher 

Reeve - the gee whiz kid, George 
Bush of Hollyvvood - and Jane 
Seymour - as beautiful and elegant 
as always - star in the story of a man 
for whom a picture is 'M>rth far more 
than a thousand Vv'OI'ds. Reeve is a 
young play'Might who falls in love 
with the picture of an actress from 
1912. Through self-hypnosis - get 
the orientation here? - he goes back 
in time and finds her. All fans of sappy 
love stories, like me, have to see it. 

FIddle, on the Roof: Perhaps the 
ultimate rTlO'>Iie musical, it tells the 
story of Russian Jews tying to adapt to 
massive cultural upheaval and 
prejudice in their country in the late 

. 19th century. Topol heads the very 
talented cast of actors \/IIho not only 
sing well, but also act with vigor. The 
movie is prooably best knONn for 
such songs as " If I Were a Rich Man," 
"Tradition" and " Matchmaker, 
Matchmaker. "

PSA to fly 
by Sunday? 

SAN DIEGO - Striking 
Pacific Southwest Airlines 
pilots and flight engineers 
worked out details yesterday 
of their return to work at the 
carrier, possible as early as 
Sunday. 

A night meeting was called 
by their union, the 
Southwest Flight Crew 
Association, to consider the 
company's contract offer and 
the back-ta-work agreement 
which must accompany it. 

"I would not expect a vote 
before Sunday unless 
something dramatic hap-
pens," union spokesman Jim 
Fitzgerald said. 

PSA, the nation 's 13th 
largest airline, said it was 
ready to fly again Sunday, for 
the first time since Sept. 25. 

At first, four flights are 
planned between San 
Francisco and Los Angeles 
with at least two between 
San Diego and Los Angeles. 
Spokesman Bill Hastings 
said "gradually over the next 
few weeks, we'll be back to 
242 flights daily." 

Senate vs. 
busing 

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Led by conservative 
RepUblicans, the Senate 
voted yesterday to prohibit 
the Justice department from 
using busing in school 
desegregation cases, a move 
the administration says 
would cripple efforts to halt 
discrimination in public 
schools. 

On a vote of 42-38, the anti-
busing amendment, sponsor-
ed bySen.JesseHelms,R-NC, 
was added to a $9.57 billion 
appropriation for the Justice 
De partment and other 
federal agencies.

The Elcphent tMn: John Hurt and 
Anthony Hopkis star in the story of a 
hideously deformed man living in 
turn-of-the-century England. Hurt, 
IIcting under tons of makeup, 
padding and costume, is the 
"elephant man," who existed as a 
circus freak attraction until he was 
rescued by a doctor (Hopkins). He is 
then befriended by the cream of 
English inteliectUdI society, but stl.1I 
ridiculed by everyone else. ThiS film IS 
a very sad, stunning look at the darker 
side of human nature. If you leave the 
theater dry-eyed, you're a strong-
willed soul.
