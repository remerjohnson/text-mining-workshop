A.S. removes limit 
on alternative media 
By DAVID BROOKS 
Stlf// Writ. 

In a move to make campus 
alternative medii Mas free as 
possible," A.S. President May-
nard Dimmesdale and the council 
approved two far-reachill8amend-
ments to the Media Board Char-
ter, lifting revenue and publica-
tion restrictions on alternative 
media. 

The fint Media Board Amend-
ment lifted a ban which had 
primarily affected larger media, 
such as the New Indicator. Under 
Section 8 of the Media Board 
Charter, A.S. funded publica-
tions had been allowed A.S. 
money for a maximum of 72 
pages per quarter. Previously, 
any additional pages had to be 
supplemented with revenue gene-
rated by the publications' adver-
tisements. 

their own ideas with funding ... 
In other business, the Council 

passed a resolution barring A.S. 
services from using polystyrene 
foam containen, citing environ-
mental concerns. 

Since the A.S. has no authority 
over Food Services' use of poly-
styrene, the resolution could only 
"strongly encourage" other cam-
pus food vendors to follow the 
same course. 

Dimmesdale also touched on 
the controversy that swelled last 
week over his proposed drastic 
budget reductions. Dimmesdale 
affirmed that his recommenda-
tions for a "streamlined and 
financially feasible" budget 
would have saved the A.S. over 
SIO,SOO; however, the difficulty 
in budgeting student salaries 
forced a re-evaluation of his 
proposals. 

The lifting of the 72-page cap, 
which New Indicator Collective 
Spokesman Monty Kroopkin 
called a "special New Indicator 
law" and a "discriminatory regu-
lation" does not necasari1y mean 

In unrelated matters, Vice 
President of External Affairs 
Mordecai Potash announced that 
he and President Dimmesdale 
will meet with U.C. Irvine repre-
sentatives to the V. C. Students 
Auociation. 

Taltl • chllCl • New Indicator spokesman Monty Kroopkin makes a plea to A.S. council to lift 6-year old 
restrictions placed on alternative media. A.S. President Maynard Dimmesdale, agreeing with 
Kroopkin, recommends to council to "take a chance" on alternative media. 

tbattheah .... w. . II-be 
automaticaUy .... nted additional Referendum passes 
funding; however, the new ruling 
now makes fundi available with 
A.S. approval. 

The A.S. also amended a 
section of the Media Board 
charter that had prevented a 
publication's advertising repre-
sentative from receiving more 
than a 20 percent commission. 

The JrviM representatives are 
apparently planning on seceding 
from tbe VCSA in protest to 
what they perceive as a UC bias 
apinst southern VCs. President 
Dimmeadale fears that with Ir-
vine's secession, the UCSA wiU 
lose its claim of representing aU 
UC schools and effectively di-
minilh much of the organiza-
tion's lobbyinl power. 

Residents vote 'yes' to 
increase next year's fees 

Warren Junior Senator Matt 
Lehrer warned that removing 
the commission cap was an invi-
tation for publication employees 
"'0 pay themselves." 

President DiIDlllCSdale respond-
ed that alternative media was 
ready to "take a chance" and 
would now be permitted to ... ry 

In other matters, Dimmesdale 
withdrew Johnny Patterson·s 
appointment to the Recreation, 
Intramural. Athletics Complex 
Proaram. Exploration and Plan-
nin, Committee. Dimmesdale's 
withdrawal was seen as an at-
tempt to upbold a degree of con-
sistency in bis administration.

Local proposition aimed 
at more money for jails 
By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
St~Wrlt. 

On June 7, while voters go to 
the poles to pick the Democratic 
and Republican nominees, they 
will also be voting on a number 
of important county proposi-
tions. 

The following is an exmination 
of two of those propositions. 
Proposition A involves a tax 
increase for prison facilities in 
San Diego and Proposition B 
involves the limiting of revenue 
allocated to San Diego by the 
state. 

Proposition A 
"I think it's an important 

proposition to meet the needs of 
crime victims and reduce the 
number of future crime victims," 
said Dee Fuller, director of the 
district attorney's Victim / Wit-
ness Assistance program. 

The purpose of Proposition A 
is to impose a county-wide half 
percent sales tax increase with 
revenue directed to finance the 
development of more regional 
justice facilities to house adult 
and juvenile offenders. If passed, 
the ordinance would also help 
payoff previous debts incurred 
during the construction of other 
detention facilities. 

The San Di~o County adult 
detention system is designed to 
hold 2,249 inmates. In fiscal year . 
'86-'87, this system housed an 
average of 3,014 inmates on a 
daily basis. The San Diego 

County Sherifrs Department has 
1.716 beds to accomodate offen-
ders, but in '86-'87 it housed 
3,066 inmates. 

In addition, over 3,000 persons 
are booked and released on their 
own recognizance every month 
by the San Diego Police Depart-
ment. 

"Overcrowding is causing ex-
cessive releases," Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving (MADD) 
of San Diego president Cynthia 
Roark said. "And those usually 
released first are drunk drivers." 

Proposition A calls for the tax 
increase to last over a ten-year 
period, during which time SI.6 
billion will be spent on the 
expansion and operation of the 
criminal justice system. 

"We haven't been doubting 
that the jails are crowded," 
President of the United Tax-
payers of San Diego Jack Sanders 
said. "But the powers that be are 
slow to think of new ways to 
solve the problem. It seems like a 
lot of money to pour into bricks 
and concrete," he added. 

Last March the county sherifrs 
department budgeted 533 million 
to be spent on this project out of 
their 51.2 million budget if 
Proposition A is not passed. 

"We need the criminal justice 
system to take its proper course 
in prosecuting and housing the 
offender," Fuller said. 

Proposition B 
"The proposition is giving the 

voters the chance to suspend the 
Gann limits for a period of time 
to facilitate spending programs," 
President of the United Tax-
payers of San Diego Jack Sanders 
said. 

If approved, the ordinance 
would increase the limits on 
spending for existing revenues. 
If the appropriation limit is not 
increased, however. revenues 
which otherwise could be allo-
cated to the County of San Diego 
by the State of California, but 
which would cause this county to 
exceed its appropriation limit if 
received. would be diverted to 
other counties within the state. 

"We think that the Gann limit 
is a good thing," Sanders said. 
"It says that the government at 
all levels spends too much money 
and requires bounds on its spend-
ing." 

"We are ranked 57 out of 58 
counties receiving money from 
the state," Chairperson of the 
Area Agency on Aging Advisory 
Council of San Diego County 
Dorothy Lipnick said. "We are 
being penalized for being frugal 
in our spending patters. We just 
want to retain out taxpayers' 
money in San Diego County," 
she added. 

According to Lipnick, the 
Gann limits are based on national 
averages of popUlation growth 
and inflation rates. 

"I think there should be limits. 
but based on average state levels 
on an individual state-to-state 
basis," Lipnick concluded.

"It probably got clobbered at 
Muir," Lehrer said; "they don't 
want anything to take away from 
their programming." This was 
not the purpose of the referen-
dum, he said; the other colleges 
had not voiced objections, but 
since Muir was very active in 
terms of programming, they 
might have felt threatened by it. 

Levine voiced another possible 
reason for the Muir objection: 
"People in the Muir College 

Council that were against it were 
commuters." 

Flyers which advocated voting 
down the resolution had been 
posted on campus prior to yester-
day's vote. The flyers, many 
found in the Muir residence halls, 
stated that Muir College Council 
advocated a vote 'no.' 

In order to pass, the refer-
endum had required that at least 
10 percent of the 3,565 on-campus 
residents vote, according to 
Levine. Since the increase is 

technically in the housing fees, it 
will be collected by the Housing 
and Food Services department, 
and re-allocated to the ICRHA 
and resident deans. 

The deans are free to use the 
money as they see fit, although 
they are expected to allocate it 
for on-campus programming. "I 
want to emphasize that this is for 
all residents, "ICRHA chair Dave 
Wolfson said; "each college will 
receive the same amount per 
student. "

.. TJrumIJlY. 114M 1. 1988 

Not everybody who cover politics has the same problem that I do. Most journalists will tell you that they strive, above all else, to be objective, to be responsible. to tell it like it is and 
some ofthem actually do that. every once in a while. It is a hard trick, 
and objective journalism is usually just another word for what Tim 
Crouse described in his classic "The Boys on the Bus," as "pack 
journalism" where even the best and the brightest in our business 
would rather be safe than sorry. 

Politics will always be a mystery and a risky one - even to 
politicians. Any journalist who thinks he can figure it out ahead is 
either dumb or crazy. So there is a certain professional comfort in 
objectivity, especially when you are sharing it with the ranking 
wizards in the business: the front page boys from the The Washington 
Post and The New York Times, the gentlemen journalists and TV 
stars from the National Press Club and the White House Press 
Room. 

When the Boys on the Bus get together at night - especially the 
Big Boys - they rarely argue about anything except who is going to 
pay forthe drinks. There is not a lot of ideological conflict among the 
people who have clawed their way up to that level, which is what it is 
all about in big-time journalism. There are no Communists in the 
crowd, no assassins or wild-eyed, glue-sniffing radicals . The geeks 
were sorted out a long time ago . 

There arc always some Wierd Ones, of course, but not many. Being 
weird in this league will usually get you fired a long time before you 
need to start filling out applications for a White House press pass, 
and those who slip through the cracks are always viewed by the 
others with a mixture of fear and affection like perverts or rogue 
elephants, a pod of some kind with no pulse. There arc only a few of 
us these days: Dan Rather, Hughes Rudd, Annie Liebowitz, Craig 
Vetter and , of course, me. 

My interest has always been very keenly results oriented. Some 
people might call that "subjective," but Voltaire would not have 
agreed, and I like to think I bring at least the same high sense of 
objectivity to my own work as he brought to his ... A~d it is worth 
noting here that the collected works of Voltaire's enemies are not 
f~und in many libraries these days. 

T hat is not the case with me. If God has made my enemies ridiculous, he has also ma~e them rich. They switch jobs bac.k 
and forth between Washington and Wall Street, and thetr 

works clog the top of the best-seller lists: Don Reagan, Michael 
Deaver, Larry Speakes, David Stockman. 

Bill Kennedy and Tom Wolfe are still up there and they will be 
hard to bump off, even by something as truly ugly as "The Confes-
sion of Ed Meese," which will not come along for a while, although it 
might come sooner than we think. 

But not soon enough for George Bush, who has his own book 
adv~nce to thing about , for good or ill, and the problems he has with 
the malignant reality of Ed Meese are not likely to go away any time 
soon, or at least not before election day. 

Not even the pope can afford "objectivity" in a U.S. election year. 
It is a luxury and a cop-out, a holding tank for bystanders. We have 
been through this before, in the case of Richard Nixon, who also has 
a book on the best-seller list this week when the Watergate scandal 
crept along for nine or IO frustrating months before it became clear 
that Nixon was as guilty offelony-conspiracy crimes as George Bush 
is today. I have been writing these things for so long that it curdles my 
memory to look at them now, and to know that noneit has made any 
difference to his chances of being the next president. In the spring of 
'87, I wrote that Bush was at least as guilty as Poindexter and the 
lunatic Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal. Bush denied it, but 
his lies only made him seem sleazier. His face has become swollen and 
he is said to be plagued by a growth of dead fatty tissue on his back, 
which is gathering in a lump in the area between his shoulder bJades 

An prevents him from walking normally. week later, when the sins of Jim and Tammy Baker made the news, I wrote about Bush's connection with another TV 
preacher, the shrewd and pious Rev. Jerry Falwell, who 

served as Bush's personal religious advisor. Lonely George had 
found trouble again. He has the instincts of a dung beetle. No living 
politician can match his talent for soiling himself in public. Bush will 
seek out filth wherever it lives going without sleep for days at a time, 
if necessary, and when he finds a new heap he will fal! down and 
wallow crazily in it, making snorting sounds out of hiS nose and 
rolling over on his back and kicking his legs up in the air like a wild 
hog coming to water. 

The real problem with Bush is not his guilt or innocence but that 
the GOP has no replacement for him if he gets nailed and tarnished 
by any Objective evidence turned up by Special Prosecutor Lawrence 
Walsh. 

There is nobody left if Bush falters except maybe Howard Baker of 
Tennessee, a former blue-chip chaUenaer for the Republican nomi-
nation who abandoned the race to take ajob a. White House chief of 
staff in order to rescue Reagan's presidency from the slurs of the evil 
Don Regan. 

It was better than Sydney Carton's beautiful gesture in "A Tale of 
Two Cities," an act of supreme self-sacrifice and it will hold up in 
history, unless Bush sets indicted before Labor Day and the GOP 
needs a savior: "It is a far, far better thin, that I do now than I have 
ever done before ... 

Ho, ho. And then he went to the suillotine. We will see now where 
Howard Baker sces.

the other members of the A.S. 
would have their story, and the 
Guardian would be the non-
biased newspaper that should 
represent, as far as possible, the 
truth. 

As we have seen occur many 
times in the past, the Guardian 
has done it again. They have 
used their position as the only 
semi-school newspaper we have, 
to represent their own feelings 
and view points. There are a 
number of issues that have been 
brought up that need a lot of 
clarification. 

(I) In the editorial, "Sandbox 
Politics," (Guardian, May 31). 
an issue is made of council salar-
ies. The A.S. President Maynard 
Dimmesdale went through dras-
tic budget cuts where he cut back 
Council member hours from 5.25 
hours per week to 5.0 hours. 
Now that doesn't seem too ridic-
ulous, but you forgot to mention 
that Dimmesdale raised his own 
salary from S7.11 an hour to 
S8.83 an hour. 

With his goal of cutting sa-
laries, how does he have the gall 
to raise his own salary? Not only 
did he attempt to cut council 
member hours, he attempted to 
do so for all of the A.S. Enter-
prises. I don't know about you, 
but I think the enterprises are 
very valuable and should not be 
cut back. Dimmesdale's inexpe-
rience was evident in the fact that 
he cannot just raise or cut salar-
ies without a new job classifi-
cation. 

What Dimmesdale did was 
wrong, and he was overridden 
on his decision. The council pro-
tected student wages, their own 
included, and kept things as sta-
tus quo. In the future, he should 
discuss these issues before sur-
prisins everyone with such dras-
tic changes. The Guardian ·s.

Gymnastics 
Should Stay 
Editor: 

As a member of the UCSD 
Gymnastics Club, I am writing 
to express my displeasure with 
administrative plans to disman-
tle the gymnastics facility in the 
south balcony ofthe Main Gym-
nasium and eliminate the gym-
nastics program in the fall in 
order to make room for other 
activities such as dance and 
aerobics. 

Their argument is that the 
area can thus be used more effi-
ciently because more students 
take part in these latter activities. 
According to that sort of logic, 
the yearly academic agenda 
should be revised to exclude 
instruction in philosophy and 
the classics in favor of ad.vanced 
tanning and inner tube water 
polo courses because students 
would be more inclined to take 
these, ratber than applying them-
selves to core cl,lrriculum. 

I don't necessarily mean to 
denisrate dance, but aerobics? 
How can you even consider doinS 
away witb a real sport like ,ym-
nastics in favor of a buncb of 
people hopping up and down to 

some insipid disco beat that does 
nothing to teach any real athletic 
skills, but simply serves to per-
petuate the shallow Southern 
California AII-Show-No-Go men-
tality which defines a challenge 
as working off that excess cot-
tage cheese in the rear by doing 
aerobic donkey-kicks. 

As for dance, the art form can 
be very beautiful, and at the 
higher levels piaces a premium 
on athletic ability, but dance 
already has access to both the 
west and north balconies of the 
Main Gym (as does aerobics, in 
addition to using the grassy 
periphery just south of the Main 
Gym and the Rec Conference 
room opposite the southeast 
corner of it), while gymnastics 
can use only the south balcony. 
The bottom line is there are lots 
of places dance and aerobics can 
and do use, but there is oruy one 
area for gymnastics. 

Instead of eliminating gym-
nastics from the curriculum, the 
administration should offer a 
variety of options to students. At 
present many students are indeed 
taking advantase of these op-
tions, with over 100 students 
currently usinS the gymnastics 
facility. 

The University has to get its 
priorities straisht.

Continued from pale 4 
pro blem is that they on ly tell half 
of the story. What Dimmesdale 
is doi ng is m ounting support by 
feed ing the public lines, and you 
are contributing by eati ng them 
up . 

(2) In regards to the recent 
controversy over appointments. 
Dimmesdale claims that he does 
not have to follow any equita ble 
process, and that they are his 
appointment . This may be true. 
but I find it very hard to accept 
from a candidate who stressed a 
turn away fro m cliq uey Greek 
council procedures. 

What Dimmesdale is doing is 
what he campaigned against. He 
should want to publicize all of 
the positions with the hope of 
obtaining the best possible can-
didate. His stubborn attitude that 
there would be no better can-
didate than Bard-Alan Finlan 
shows me that he does not intend 
to change the system, and that he 
is using it to his own advantage. 
Dimmesdale owes the students 
at UCSD the opportunity to 
apply for any position . What the 
Guardian did , however , is dis-
cuss Finlan rather than discuss 
t he real reason he was voted 
down . 

Dimmesdale REFUSED to 
accept an application for the 
position of Student Advocate 
from one student, and by not 
publicizing the position. in effect 
he refused applications from all 
other students. Just because Fin-
Ian is having problems with the 
University does not make him 
qualified for the position. There 

are other things to consider in 
such an important position , and 
Dimmesdale is forgetting all of 
those. Perhaps his inexperience 
as an elected Council member is 
showing in Ihe procedure he is 
using to make his appointments. 

Now there is another iss ue in 
the appointment process that 
Dimmesdale is raising to cloud 
over the issue of not publicizing 
the posit ions. He brought up the 
fact t hat he intended to appoint 
Johnny Patterso n to a posi t ion 
withou t advert ising it. I believe 
t hat is also improper, and taht is 
why I motioned for it 10 be 
postponed . 

In the editorial , you say that 
Patterson was apPointed rather 
than postponed . You should 
check your facts. Rather than 
vote it down, we postponed the 
appointment for further consi-
deration, at which time Dimmes-
dale can come back and ammend 
the legislation. The reason we 
didn't vote Patterson down, and 
that we did vote Finlan down, 
was because Finlan was voted on 
before Patterson. Once we had 
made our point , and also be-
cause Dimmesdale did not accept 
a motion to postpone, we showed 
Dimmesdale that what he did 
was wrong, and that we would 
not accept such actions. It is now 
up to Dimmesdale to decide what 
is an equitable process for 
appointments should be, consi-
deringall of the information that 
has been brought up in the recent 
weeks . 

Also, in the article, "President 
angered by council politics," 
(Guardian, May 31). John Shaw, 
the newly elected Editor-in-Chief, 

mentions the Finlan problem in 
a very biased article, and doesn't 
interview some of the other 
members involved to get their 
sides of the story. This in effect 
endorses one side over another 
by only telling one side of the 
story. In a feature article, you 
should not use opinions, and 
should approach all individuals 
involved . I hope Ihis will not be a 
preview of S haw's intentions for 
the Guardian in t he comi ng year. 

(3) As fo r working with the 
counci l, and all of the pol it iking 
tha t occurs, it is something that 
Dimmesdale could have avoided 
if he was at all interested in what 
the rest of the Council had to 
say. He is on this high horse 
thinking that he has the unani-
mous student body support be-
cause he clearly beat his oppo-
nent. 

We are all representatives of 
the students, and although the 
Guardian may not feel this is 
true, the Council is looking out 
for student's concerns. I am very 
surprised that the Guardian en-
dorses policies which allow ap-
pointments to be made without 
advertising them. . 

In the future, I would greatly 
appreciate your newspaper check-
ing their information, and ap-
proaching both sides of an issue 
to better inform the students, 
and hopefully attempt to stay 
away from biased articles.

includes Assemblyperson Robert

Criminal Justice President 
Thomas J. Nolan, Jr., point out

some, like university police, are 
not. In addition, the penalty for 
second degree murder will be 
made equal to or tougher than 
the penalty for first degree mur-
der, which opponents claim 
would provide incentives for 
murders to commit first degree,

Lelillative Campailns Spendlnl 
Limitations 

Presently, California law does 
not generally impose limits on 
political campaign contributions, 
although politicians must report 

money they receive and expen-
ditures they make during the 
course of a campaign. 

Prop. 68 imposes limits on 
campaign contributions to candi-
dates for Assembly and Senate, 
namely: 
·51 ,000 per person to a candi-

date 
• 52,500 per organization to a 

candidate 
• 55,000 per PAC (Political 

Action Committee) to a candidate 
Other restrictions will also 

apply. 
The proposition's second main 

effect wiII be to provide state 
matching funds to candidates if 
they agree to comply with limits 
on spending for their legislative 
campaigns. The source of the 
matching funds will be state 
income tax payers , who may 
designate up to three dollars of 
their income tax payments for 
use as campaign money.

not be eligible for matching funds, 
which may be as much as 
S 125,000 for primaries, and up 
to S 175,000 for general elections, 
depending on the office being

The fiscal cost of the measure 
is estimated to be about 59 million 
a year less in tax revenues and 52 
million in administrative costs . 

Those in favor of Prop. 68, 
including California League of 
Women Voters President Carol 
J. Federighi and former chairman 
of the California Fair Political 
Practices Commission Daniel 
Lowenstein, decry the "corrupt-

Prop. 68's opponents focus

Day Care responsible for 
more than just child's play 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 

St~J W,ite, 

A t 4:30 p.m. the day is almost over at UCSD's Early Childhood Edu-
cation Center .and the place is 
noisy with the yells and laughter 
of86 one- through five-year olds 
waiting for their parents to pick 
them up. 

The center, which sits on the 
outskirts of UCSD, consists of 
three mobile-home trailers hous-
ing three classroom programs: 
La Palma Infant Program for 
children 2 years and under; The 
Treehouse for two- three-year-
olds; and La Barranca Preschool 
for kids three to five years of age. 

The center's director Josie 
Foulks, said that the stress of 
being a preschool teacher has 
been compared to the stress of 
being an air-traffic controller. At 
4:30 p.m. along with the teachers 
and work-study students, Foulks 
begins the final daily clean-up 
after the 50-odd preschoolers, 26 
toddlers and 14 infants who, 
since arriving at 7:45 a.m. that 

Rubes® 

morning, have managed 10 smear 
fingerpainl and other gooey sub-
stances onto every table and wall 
in the room. 

Over at The Treehouse, one of 
the substitute teachers, is mediat-
ing between two little boys who 
a re fight ing. 

Nearby, one little girl is pul-
ling another around the room by 
her shirt. The shirt comes off and 
the end result is a screaming, 
hysterical tug-of-war, broken up 
by a work-study student. 

Another child, a little girl in 
the toddler program, is lying on 
the ground crying after a chair 
fell on her while she was playing 
with it. Soon someone notices 
that she is cryir.g and comforts 
her. 

To subject oneself voluntarily 
to such nerve-wracking, some-
times urgent situations one would 
either have to be a loving parent. 
someone who enjoys migraine 
headaches, or a preschool teach-
er. 

"You've got to really love kids 
to survive this job," said Sobera-
nis Ludi, a teacher at The Tree-
house who works with another 

Peanuts characters, one million B.C. 

educator, three half-time teach-
ers, and several work-study stu-
dents. 

To keep the quality of child-
care at UCSD high, each teacher 
and work-study student (there 
are about 40 students in all) is 
expected to "encourage the active 
self-initiated and self-regulated 
development of the childrens' 
socialization skills, their motor 
skills, [and] verbalization and 
pre-reading skills," according to 
the parent-information pamphlet 
the center pu blishes. 

There are 12 fult- and part-
time teachers at La Barranca as 
well as the La Palma Infant Pro-
gram and the Treehouse Toddler 
Program. The full-time teachers 
most of whom have bachelor's or 
master's degrees, average about 
S 1,200 a month with benefits. 
The part-time teachers make 
S7.07 per hour, the same as a 
secretary / typist on campus. 

"The pay IS great lor students, 
[but) it's hard for the single [stu-
dent] parents that work here to 
support their families," said part-
time teacher Nicole Martin. 

Celia Reza, who works as a 
full-time teacher at La Barranca, 
said she feels that there is not 
enough clout being given to pre-
schoolteachers. 

"I feel like the parents and 
society in general see me as just a 
glorified babysitter and r resent 
it," Reza said. 

Kindergarten teachers in gene-
ral get paid more than preschool 
teachers, despite the fact that 
they both are expected to per-
form the same tasks. In compari-
son to UCSD's program, San 
Diego Unified School District 
kindergarten teachers are ex-
pected to pursue the same goals 
as preschool teachers. such as 
teaChing the basic reading and 
writing skills, but they get paid 
more according to Shelia Gen-
ung who works in the Wage and 
Salary Department for the 
SDUSD. 

In many cases ECEC preschool 
teachers have a greater degree of 
formal education than SDUSD 
teachers, but on the average, 
they are still paid less. According 
to Genung, the entry-level kin-
dergarten teachers who have one 
year of experience in child care 
and a bachelor's degree get paid 
SI,688 per month at San Diego 
Unified. On the other hand. a 
San Diego Unified preschool 
teacher gets paid 51.546 a month 

Josie Foulks is director of UCSD 
day care 
after completing an Associate 
Arts degree and taking at least 36 
units of early childhood educa-
tion / training. 

The low pay of day-care 
teachers is only one of the cur-
rent day-care issues being debated 
at UCSD and in the community 
at large. 

Another dispute surrounding 
day-care on,campus involves the 
lack of high-quality, affordable 
day-care available to UCSD 
students. faculty and staff. The 
UCSD day-care center is one of 
only about four or five places in 
San Diego that accepts children 
under two years of age. 

Although there are many on-
campus mothers who, by choice 
or by need. are working, there is 
a very slim chance of receiving a 
spot at the center. and the chance 
of receiving one of the 27 govern-
ment-subsidized slots is almost 
nil; there is a three- to four-year 
waiting list. 

Many single or budgeted stu-
dent-parents or University em-
ployees put their children on the 
waiting list before they are born 
and hope to receive a space in the 
program before these children 
reach kindergarten. 

Another on-campus option for 
parents is to pay from 5345 to 
$380 (depending on the age of 
the child) for a non-subsidized 
space. The waiting list to receive 
one of these spaces is anywhere 
from one week to two or three 
years; the only time one of the 86 
spaces opens up at the center is 
when a parent graduates or a 
child reaches kindergarten age, 
director Josie Foulks said . 

Donna Maldonado put her 
daughter Becky on the waiting 
list when she was six months old, 
and she got her in the program a 
year-and-a-half later. Her hus-
band is a student at UCSD. She 
chose the Early Childhood Edu-

UCSD center provides quality

Continued from pale I 
cation Center because she agrees 
with the curriculum. and because 
the center is recognized for its 
quality care. 

"When I moved to the U.S. I 
thought that this was the land of 
liberty. [ never thought there 
would be a day-care problem. 
When I first came bere, I couldn't 
find any day care ... most places 
off campus do not give quality 
care. and institutions that are 
recognized do not have any 
space." Maldonado said . 

According to Foulks. the only 
way to provide low-cost, quality 
day care for students who do not 
have an extra S400 each month 
to spend on child care is through 
government subsidies to day-care 
programs. The ECEC depends 
on the help of outside sources to 
fund its subsidized day-care. 

Currently, the center recei .. es 
approximately 595,000 annually 

from the UCSD administration; 
$126.0000 annually from the 
State Department of Education 
for subsidized child-care; and 
518,000 annually from the federal 
government to provide breakfast,

Hilltory of the UCSD Day-Care 
Center 

Josie Foulks was one of the 
first student-parents at UCSD to 
actively protest day-care center 
issues and in 1969 her efforts 
paid off when the first on-campus 
day-care program began. 

Student-parents. including 
Foulks. organized a cooperative 
babysitting service in Revelle 
Plaza. and later in the backyard 
of Dana Hall. The center grew in 
the 1970s and by 1977 the day-
care program was becoming an 
established part of the Univer-
sity. 

That year Chancellor William 
McElroy planned to turn cam-
pus child-care over to an outside 
franchise. An active group of 
undergraduates held a three-day

sit-in in the chancellor's office, 
which culminated in t he hand -
cuffi ng a nd arrest of 21 people. 
The center, however, was allowed 
to stay open. 

Also, a petition was circulating 
around campus which stated that 
the UCSD community supported 
the present center, and that they 
were willing to have SI of their 
registration fees go toward main-
taining and expanding the center. 
Consequently, the fu nds gener-
ated fro m present students' regi-

day-care center is able to provide 
bettcr quality day-ca re today.

The year's top ten achievements 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
and PHIL GRUEN 

Editor's note: As the 1987-88 
athletics seasonfinal/y comes to 
a close. a look back reveals a 
successful year for UCSD sports. 
Thefollowing is. in our opinion. 
the top ten Triton achievements 
(either by an individual or a 
team) over the past academic 
year. 

1 
Rob Rittgers 
sinks 24 consecu-
tive free throws 

UC San Diego. March /6. 
1988 - Because of the sheer 
magnitude of his record-breaking 
feat of 24 consecutive frcc throws, 
the top achievement of the 1987-
88 season rightly belongs to 
Triton junior point guard Rob 
Rittgers. 

To refresh the reader's me-
mory, Rittgers went to the line 
after Menlo College was assessed 
12 two-shot technical fouls for 
clearing their bench after an 
altercation between UCSD's 
Nick Capuano and Menlo's Ken 
Welsh. 

Rittgers finished the night 30-
for-3O from the line after sinking 
six more free throws in the second 
half. 

The amazing feal set records 
. of Beamonesque proportions, 
especially since it is highly im-
probable anyone will ever be 
given the opportunity to shoot 
24 straight free throws in a game 
again. NCAA records set as a 
result of Rittgers' shooting in-
clude most free throws made in a 
game by an individual, most free 
throw attempts by an individual, 
most consecutive free throws, 
and a Division III team record of 
53 free throws in 59 attempts 
(assisted by a IO-of-II perfor-
mance by Andy Jedynak). 

The event received more na-
tional press coverage than any 
other UCSD athletic accomplish-

ball wins second 
consecutive 
NCAA Champi-
onship 

Elmhurst. Illinois. November 
/ I . /987 - The women's volley-
ball squad became the first team 
in NCAA Division III volleyball 
history to win back-to-back titles 
with their three-set win over 
Elmhurst University. 

The Tritons also became the 
first team to win four volleyball 
national championships: 1981, 
1984, 1986 and 1987. 

Led by first-team Ali-Ameri-
cans Janet Hughes and Carol 
Lipson, Elmhurst fell easy prey 
to the Tritons, 16-14, 16-14, 
15-10. 

The win extends the team's 
winnin, streak against Division 
III teams to 31 matches, a streak 
they hope to continue next year.

Tim Vallez wins 
800 meter race 
at Nationals 

Northfield. Minnesota. May 
27. 1988 - Behind by a good 

four yards headed into the final 
straightaway, Tim Vallezstrcaked 
by the lead i ng runner of Carleton 
College to become UCSD's first 
runner to win a national cham-
pionship. 

Vallez finished in 1:51.86, half 
a second off his university record 
time of I :51.48, set in the national 
prelims the day before. 

This achievement was accom-
plished despite the lack of a 
decent training facility at UCSD 
(in fact, the Tritons could not 
even host a home meet all year) . 

Because of bis first place finish, 
Vallez was also named as an 
All-American.

strikes out 18 
batters against 
Whittier 

UC San Diego. April 9, /988 
- Junior pitcher Rick Nowak 
struck out 18 batters in a 15-2 
defeat of Whittier College in the 
second game of a doubleheader. 
Nowak earned his sixth win of 
the season and improved the 
Triton record to 20-9. 

Nowak scattered four hit. and 
walked only two batten during 
the game. He allo managed to 
strike out the side in the third, 
seventh and ninth innin .. en 
route to his record-breakin, 18 
strikeouts. 

As a side note to Nowak's 

accomplilhment, he also ma-
naacd to Itrike out nine batters 
in three inninp of relief earlier in 
the "Ion. The Itrikeouts add to 
Nowak'l lilt of feats, which 
include two no-hitters from the 
198711CUOD. Chancesare Nowak 
will DOt be returning to the Tri-
toni Dext year. as he is expected 
to be drafted by a major league 
bal1club.

earns 39 points 
to lead the men's 
swim team to 
third place at 
Nationals 

Atlanta. Georgia. March 17-
/9. 1988 - Kip Fulbcck earned 
39 points at the NCAA Division 
III National Tournament to lead 
the Tritons to their sixth con-
secutive third place finish, one 
point behind second-place Clare-
mont College. They had been 
estimated to do no better than 
fifth. 

Fulbeck placed in a total of 
seven events but the 39 points 
came from a second-place finish 
in the 50 freestyle with a time of 
2O.99scconds, a third place finish 
in the lOG-yard butterfly in 50.98, 
and an 11th place finish in the 
lOG-free (46.55). 

Fulbeck also swam the free-
style lengths for the second place 
200 and ninth place 400-yard 
medley relay teams, and also 
participated on UCSD's 2OG- and 
400-yard freestyle relay teams, 
both of which finished in second 
place.

Men's Water Po-
lo beats Division 
I Pepperdine 
University in sud-
den death 

UC San .Diego. October 17. 
/988 - at approximately 800, 
the men's water polo team came 
from a 10-9 deficit in the second 
overtime period to defeat cur-
rently seventh-ranked Pepper-
dine University by an 11-IOscore 
in sudden death overtime. 

Neither team led by more than 
two goals during the entire game 
as the score see-sawed between 
them. UCSD led after the first 
quarter of competition, 3-2. Pep-
perdine came back to lead 5-4 at 
the half. The two teams then 
exchanged a series of goals, 
leaving the score at the end of 
regulation time tied at nine goals 
apiece. 

Pepperdinc scored once to take 
a 10-9 lead 'at the end of the first 
overtime period. UCSD tied it in 
the second period, sending the 
game into ludden death. 

Jason Vance won the sprint 
for UCSD, but a turnover sent 
the Tritons on the defensive. 
Triton goalie Randy Franke 
recorded his eightccnth save of 
the game to spoil Pepperdine's 
threat. 

Back on the offensive, UCSD's 
Larry Sanders found Jefferson 
Smith open on· the wing and 
earned the assist as Smith scored 
his second goal of the game, 
giving the Tritons a dramatic 
win.

Greatly contributing to the 
Tritons' victory was Dave 
"Buster" Calder, who scored 4 
goals in the game. 

The Triton defense also bad-
gered Sasha Poljak of Yugo-
slavia, Pepperdine's offensive 
phenomenon, enough to frustrate 
him out ofthe game. In the third 
quarter, Poljak violently disputed 
a 'call by t he referee, resulting in 
his ejection.

Tracy Ragatz 
records highest 
three-point shoot-
ing percentage in 
women's college 
basketball 

1987-88 - The NCAA allowed 
for the three-point shot in wo-
men's basketball for the fint 
time this season, an opportunity 
Tracy Ragatz welcomed with 
opened arms. Ragatz led the 
nation in thrcc-point shooting 
percentage, making 48 out of 86 
attempts (55.8 percent). 

Sinceit was the first time the 
three-point line was used, Ragatz 
officially holds the NCAA record 
for shooting percentage .. well. 
By comparison, the percentage 

leader in Division II, Jackie 
Farnan of New York Tech, shot 
50.9 percent. In Division I, Jamie 
Siess of Oakie State shot 51.2 
percent. 

Thanks to her efforts, as well 
as a 3-for-8, .37 percent addition 
by her teammates, .UCSD ma-
naged a 54.3 percentale for 
three-point shots as a team. All 
other women's teams shot under 
SO percent. 

headed into the National tour-
nament despite finishing in third 
place one year before, lost only 
to Carolyn Bodart of Menlo 
College en route to a 4-1 record 
and a second place finish at 
Nationals. 

The tournament victories 
raised sophomore Behrens' re-
cord to a sterling 20-5, and earned 
her All-American status for the 
second consecutive year. As the

Franke saved the Tritons 18 times against Pepperdine

Christine Behrens 
Finishes Second 
at Nationals 

Atlanta. Georgia, May 10. 
1988 - UCSD women·s .tennis 
star Christine Behrens, unranked 

number one seed on the Triton 
team all season long, Behrens 
compiled a 16-4 record. 

Despite Behrens' success 
against D!vision III 6pponents 
in the team competition at 
Nationals, the women's team was 
unable to defend their 1987 title. 

The doubles team of Behrens 
and Rhonda Meier was also suc-
cessful this year, as they went 14-
6 during the regular season and 
qualified for the Nationals.

Incredible De-
fense Leads Wo-
men's Soccer to 
14-5-2 Record 
1987 - Although there was a 
great deal of excellent offensive 
performances, there is no possible 
way the UCSD women's soccer 
team could have compiled their 
14-5-2 record this season without 
the help of their defense. 

led by All-American halfback 
Susan Kramer and goalie Julie 
Freiss, who allowed only 0.78 
goals per game in the goal, the 
Tritons recorded eight consecu-
tive shutouts and held opposing 
teams to one goal or less in 15 
out of their 21 games. 

In Division III alone, UCSD 
outscored opponents 36-2, quali-
fying for NCAA regionals .

Also contributing to the wo-

Crystal Konno's fifth and sixth 
place finishes in the 200-meter

also contributed significantly to 
the success of the entire team.

Athletics 
Awards 
Tonight 

Now that the UCSD athletic 
season has come to a conclusion, 
it is time to honor those individ-
uals and teams who achieved 
success in the 1987-88 year. 
Tonight, beginning at 6:30, the 
annual UC San Diego Athletics 
Awards Night will be held on the 
baseball field. Triton basketball 
coach Tom Marshall was selected 
to emcee the event, which offi-
cially begins with a dinner at 
5:30. 

The program, scheduled to 
conclude around 8:30, will fea-
ture the presentation of the 
UCSD "Athletes of the Year." 
Last year fourteen athletes were 
selected for this award, which is 
based almost wholly upon the 
athletic success of the individual 
during the past academic year. 

There will also be a presenta-
tion of the Alumni Senior A ward, 
in which one male senior and one 
female senior will be recognized 
on the basis of their athletic 
achievements, academics, and 
community involvement during 
their college career. All-Ameri-
cans and Academic All-Ameri-
cans will also be awarded at the 
ceremony. 

The UCSD teams that per-
formed in National competition 
will also be recognized, headed 
most notably by the women's 
volleyball team who captured 
the National title for the second 
consecutive year. The second 
ranked women's swim team, in 
addition to the men's swim team, 
the women's tennis team, and the 
women's water polo team, each 
of which finished third, will also 
be awarded. 

The presentation of these· 
awards will be handled by Judy 
Sweet, the Intercollegiate Direc-
tor of Athletics, and A. W. Russ, 
the ASsistant Vice-Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Affairs. The cere-
mony will be concluded with the 
talent show, in which various 
teams will perform skits on stage.

INNERTUBE WATERPOLO~ 
PlAYOFF PICTURE 

We started with 42 teams in three dif-
ferent divisions (5-31). Eight have been 
eliminated and 31 more will fall before the 
champIons are crowned on Tuesday. June 
7. The race for the tille in the A and AA 
divisions is wide open, but the AAA crown 
should be a two-horse race. 

At the beginning of the season it ap-
peared that the AAA division would be 
one of the most competitive in years. As 
the regular season ended it became appar-
ent that Sean Wiggrns and Tim Perfect 
had assembled an unbeatable crew that 
deserved to wear the infamous AIID 
name. Their only competllion came from 
Casey Coogan 's veteran team w.t Inner 
""", but Coogan and Co. will have to beat 
a much improved Squelch team to get to 
the finals on Tuesday at 9:00 pm. Abids 
should coast past either the DIvofheocII 
or SWIm faglA Fagettee en route to the 
championship game where rumor has it 
several Abid Hall-of-Famers will be pres-
ent (If someone can come up with their 
ball money). 

In the AA dIviSIon we have several solid 
teams that could take home the title. 
Someone HorIcd OUr ClotMt and Set-
tin' The Hole both finrshed undefeated, 
but came from a weaker league than the 
highly rated Slippery wtIen w.t and LOll 

AlSea. Any one four could annex 
the title, but don't count out the dark horse 
teams of WA.Q.N.f.N. or the w.t 0..0-
men_ It looks like experience could play 
an important role in this division. which 
gives an edge to tiorkd, Slippery, W.A.G. 
and Setlin'. Look for the teams with battle 
tested veterans to make it to Tuesday's 
9:00 championship game .. 

Wide o~en is the only way to describe 
the A division. Twenty·seven teams entered 
the playoffs at this level. Trying to sort out 
the contenders from the pretenders is 
tough to do at this pornt. The top seeds

Resisting changes 
"The Madwoman of Chail-

lot" by Giraudoux begins as a 
conflicting swirl of sentimen-
tality and modernity. Na.tal-
gia grips the familiar as it faces 
irrational, impending change 
in this humorous, witty play 
currently showins at the Mar-
quis Public Theatre. 

Out of a cacophony of 
voices and discordant action, 
in which personal sentiment 
comes face-to-face with greedy 
expansion, emerges the Mad-
woman of Chailloc (Ann Rich-
ardson), a well-played char-
acter whose extremely aber-
rant behavior and philosophy 
are just what can save the 
world from greedy progress 
and thouKhdess modernity. 

The play strikes close to 
home as a modern-day fable 
about the havoc which greedy 
developers and speculators 
cause in their punuit of capi-
tal. The prot8lOnilt of the 
play, • demented old apinater 
who clinp to put memories 

bv vincent andrade 
hiatua intern 

and effects with a certainty I 
that everyday life serves to 
reinforce, is out to save the 
apathetic individuals caught 
between insane sentiment and 
devious greed. 

The citizens of Chaillot are 
people who do not dina to the 
past like the Madwoman, yet 
who. like her, have much to 
10ie to the erosion of their 
day-to-day environment. 
Much as students of UCSD 
witness the butcherina of the 
eucalyprua sroves and , ac-
quiesce to'the deforestation of 
the campus, the citizens of the 
Paris quarter of Chaillot suffer 
the abuse of change and pro-
gress with no hope of slOWing 
or stopping the process. 

The movement and inter-
action in the first act between 
the ~-:x>d citizens of Chaillot 
and the evil capitalists of the 
world opens the way in the 
second act for the Mad-
woman's solution, as well as 
the more humorous parts of 
the play. If the first act is 

funny, the second act IS a free-
for-all of witty repartee and 
quick dialogue. 

The second act allows the 
development of characters 
which the timing and tempo 
the first act did not. Personal 
sentiment is explained and 
valorized. The pitfalls of in-
decision and regret for put 
actiona are presented; redemp-
tion . is achieved through the 
renewed value of the present. 

"The Madwoman of Chall-
lot" is about the rediscovery 
of human emotion and the 
value of everyday experience. 
It has a messaae for the student 
faced with a . temporal exis-
tence and a changing environ-
ment. We are all living in a 
space where human sentiment 
and the holding of material 
things as sacred are discour-
aged. 

It is a 'Part of the structure 
of UCSD to encourqe this 
detachment from everyday life 
as each of us concentratf'I' on

Erasing all traces .of innocence 
by patty jettie 

hlatulnrem 

Vicent Clarke and Andrew 
Bill of Erasure have followed 
their trademark of creating 
pop songs. Yet Erasure's 
latest album "The Inno-
cents" is an example of how a 
synthesizer band can overstep 
the bounds of technopop and 

enter the land of blase. 
Clarke's involvement with 

such groups as Depeche Mode 
and Yaz is reflected in the 
band's prominent use of syn-
thesizers. In the past, Erasure 
avoided the typical tinny 
sound by successfully over-
lappinl simple pop melodies 
with funky bass lines. 

The duo's most recent en-

Erasure's latest album "The Innocents" is heallily influenced by rechnopop. 

deavor, however, has lost 
danceability and comes across 
as a commercially slick album. 
One song flows into the next, 
giving off an apparent lack of 
individuality. 

Perhaps what thwarts the 
album '5 potential is the band's 
change in producers. Both 
"Wonderland" and "The 
Circus" were produced by 
Flood, whereas Stephen 
Hague, who has worked with 
Orchestral Maneuvers in the 
Dark, Pet Shop Boys and New 
Order, controlled "The Inno-
cents." The album is a reflec-
tion of Hague's style 
rather than Erasure's. 

One of the album's weakelt 
points is that Clarke over-
shoots his vocal range. On 
"Ship of Fools" the lower 
notes come out raspy instead 
of husky as he tries to convey 
the seriousness of life's cruel-
ties. On "Chains of Love" his 
voice is annoyingly breathy as 
he tries to hit notes beyond his 
reach. 

Yet "The Innocents" has a 
few cuts similar in style to 
"The Circus." The opening 
song "A Little Respect," per-
haps to be Erasure's first sin-
gle, grooves with accoustic gui-
tar riffs that lend both person-
ality and danceability to the 
melody. "Phantom Bride," a 
light pop song with a solid 
beat, confronts the loneliness 

of sinRle motherhood. "He 
wcu a good 00, from the other side 
of town/said he could Neat her 
right said he could win her 
round/her morning sickness and 
the kick inside the hantom 

kisses of the phantom bride." 
Overall, the album is a dis-

appointment. Erasure has 
drifted from its unique style 
into the more bland main-
stream of

• oneBIG movie 
by phil maqovern 

hlatw writer 

"Big," a new escapist 
comedy directed by " Laverne 
and Shirley" star Penny Mar-
shall, is a hilarious adventure 
which explores a child's view 
of the adult world. It may 
remind you at first of a couple 
of body-switching comedies 
that have come out in the last 
year, namely " Vice Versa" 
and "Uke Father Uke Son." 
"Big" is like them in many 
ways, but its humor is a cut 
above. It is the realization of 
almost any child's dream: to 
be big. 

Tom Hanks stars as Josh 
Baskin, a 12-year-old boy who 
has been transformed into a 
35-year-old man by a carnival 
wishing machine. When he 
wakes up to find that his wish 
to be "big" has been granted, 
Josh is confused and frigh-
tened at being thrust into the 
adult world for which he is 
utterly unprepared. 

Only when he gets his first 
job as a computer operator at 
a large toy company, (and 
then gets promoted to manage-
ment after a hilarious encoun-
ter with his boss in a toy store) 
does he discover that being 

big, as he always suspected, 
has definite advantages: free-
dom and unlimited money to 
spend. 

One thing Josh is not expect-
ing are the perilous ways that 
grown-ups live their love life. 
He unwittingly attracts the 
attention of the chic, ambi-
tious Susan Lawrence (Eliza-
beth Perkins of" About Last 
Night ... " and "From the 
Hlp" ). Susan is attracted to 
Josh's boyishness and his ap-
parent flair for predicting what 
children will like . 

She expects that he knows 
as much as she does about the

Only when they spend their 
first night together innocently 
sleeping in bunk beds after 
jumping on the trampoline 
does Susan realize that there 
really is something different 
about Josh. 

Of course, there are a few 
things about Josh that Susan 
doesn't know: the phone calls 
to his mother (she thinks that 
Josh had been kidnapped, and 
in a nice touch, his picture 
turns up on a milk carton), the 
visits from his best friend Billy 
Kopeche (Jared Rushton), 
who is still 12-years-old and 
trying to look out for his 
friend. When Josh balks at 
commitment l she assumes he's 
another Peter Pan type, afraid 
to grow up. She doesn 't realize 
that he is telling the truth 
when he says "I'm a child ... 

Josh has to grow up fast, 
losing his childhood freedom 
overnight, trading it in for 
adult responsibilities . This 
alienates Billy, who expects 
Josh to remain his best friend. 
Josh starts to miss his family 
terribly and he longs for his 
lost youth . Billy finds the 
carnival machine, but Josh 
doesn't know if he should use 

Hanks, star of "Spluh," 
"The Money Pit," "Nothina 
in Common" and "Dragner," 
is wonderfully cast u Josh. He 
plays the role with a casual 
liahtness, a style that was

PMS d 
an 

UTF 
by pam conley 

We all know that with finals ' 
come late night munchies, zits, 
procrastination, tension head-
aches, Excedrin, PMS (both 
male and female included), 
and maybe even a slight case 
of nausea and vomiting. How-
ever, the end of school does 
have at least one good attrib-
ute: it brings with it the cele-
bration of the Undergraduate 
Theatre Festival. 

For only 99¢ you can see 
some top notch talent per-
forming at the Warren Thea-
tre June 2 and 3 at 8 p.m. and 
June 4 and 5 at 2 p.m. and 8 
p.m. 

The five plays featured this 
year are "Golf," "Sickler's,'" 
"Three Nuns from Cuba," 
"Half," and "Screemsawng." 
The play "Screemsawng," 
written by Kerrie Gallagher, 
Suzanne C. Oster and Kim-
berly Mohn proves to be an 
exceptional and very moving 
work. The director, up-and-
coming Loren E. Chadima, 
does an excellent job of expres-
sing images of life through 
movement, poetry and rhy-
thm. 

This production highlights 
the transitional phases of life 
starting in the womb and pro-
gressing through the teens, col-
lege, the thirties, and on 
through middle age to the final 
stage of being a senior. This 
production depicts how in 
many ways being a senior is a 
reversion back to childhood 
and is where the most beauti-
ful expression of self abounds.

"Amazing Spirit" is a compilation of scenes from three 

plays that will be presented by the students of Com-
munication and Culture 116, Feminist Theater Work-
shop, on June 6 and June 8 at 8 p.m. in the Media and 
Communication Center room 140. 

The play was compiled from two of Caryl Churchill's 
works, "Cloud Nine" and "Top Girls," and Megan 
Terry's piece "Molly Bailey." Both writers' plays take 
place in the late nineteenth century where women were 
defined by male constraints. But these characters also had 
the capabilities to work toward a better understanding of 
themselves. 

, 

What has made "Amazing Spirit" so interesting is that 
the actors are not theater majors and haven't had formal 
training in acting. But all the performers and crew are 
interested in acting and are putting a lot of rehearsal time 
into the production. 

Chaillot 
Continued from page 1 
building a future reward. 

The irony of the play is that 
the experience we accept with-
out qualm is, for the citizens 
of Chaillot, a reason for sad-
ness and alienation. It is the 
Madwoman's responsibility to 
save them from an uncaring 
progress. Perhaps the "Mad-
woman of Chaillot" illustrates 
to the audience that only we 
can save ourselves. 

The acting of the 15-
member cast was energetic and 
lively, and the dialogue was 

-sabrina youmans 

sparkling and vibrant. The 
play is a well-working piece of 
social satire. 

"The Madwoman of Chail-
lot" will be playing at the 
Marquis Public Theatre 
through July 3: Friday and 
Saturday at 8 p .m.; Sunday at 
7 p.m. The theatre is located 
at 3717 India Street, a few 
doors down from Gelato Vero 
Caffe in Mission Hills. 

Its small size allows a good 
view from any seat in the 
house, and the interior struc-
ture encourages an intimate 
performance.

reservations call 295-5654.

Big 
Continue~ from pale 6 
but she is essentially upstaged 
by Hanks, who has all the 
good lines as the movie is a 
one man show. 

Penny Marshall directed 
(her second try , her first being 
"Jumpin' Jack Flash"), and I 
don't know whether to credit 
her or the writing with the 
ending. I can't give it away, 
but I can say that it doesn't go 
the way that most movies run 
their endings. Aside from that, 
there are a few good shots at 
the beginning, which show 
how bad it is to be small, that 
show a first directional hand. 

The jokes come fast and 
furious at the beginning, but 
they tail off toward the 
middle and the end as the love 
affair between Josh and Susan 
starts. They don't disappear 
altogether, which is a credit to 
the writers (Gary Ross and 
Anne Spielberg). It all co'.nes 
together under the production 
talents of James L. Brooks, 
award-winning director and 
producer of "Terms of En-
dearment" and " Broadcast 
News." 

"Big" comes highly recom-
mended, but it is not a movie 
that is consciously moving. It 
is what a comedy should be, 
funny and light hearted. See 
this movie for a good laugh 
and a good time.
