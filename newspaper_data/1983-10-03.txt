SPEED! 

Thomas Tucker, new director of the 
Student Center, is a large-scale guy. Tall and 
broad-shouldered, he grabs all of your 
attention right away. He has an aggressively 
friendly smile and handshake and overall go 
get 'em attitude that, imposing cis it is, is 
definitely appealing. Like his frame and 
demeanor, his ideas are large-scale overviews; 
one finds oneself moving farther and farther 
away in order to get a sense of clarity from 
his "big picture. "

AS Forum 
The ASUCSD CounCil held its first meeting of the faU quarter last Wednesday 

near the Student Center. Relatively uneventful , the meeting was only an hour 
long, as many items had to be tabled for further investigation by the Finance 
Committee. Focus was placed on AS President Craig Lee's appointment of a 
new Appointments and Evaluations (A &: E) commissioner, Marc Broditski , 
which required two-thirds of the Council's approval.. .. 

Apparently, advertisements to attract potential applicants for the position 
were not sulTicient for some members of the Council (although it should be 
noted that Broditski was approved overwhelmingly, eight to two). "It's not reaUy 
fair to everyone else: stated Council Member Kaaren Bekken. Council 
Representative Greg Ricks, urging approval of the presidential appointment, 
countered Sekken. "Everyone gets aD excited if the President knows this person 
[Broditski and Lee have known one another since the former was in charge of 
the music store Assorted VinylJ . But the appointment is a good one." Said Lisa 
Stenmark, "It sucks. It's happened every year. Henry [ChuJ did it the year before, 
and I'm sure that a lot of presidents before them did it" .... 

As for Broditski, the Job of A & E commissioner IS his first in student 
government. Although technically a rookie, he already seems to have a definite 
grasp on the duties of his job. "There are approximately 70 committees on 
campus in which undergraduate representation is required ," said Brodltski in 
an interview with the Guardl£ln a day after his appointment. "Basically my 
pOSition is to fill those 70 spots, although the largest portion of my Job is to get 
apathetiC students to become Involved" .. .. 

In other AS news, Vice President Elizabeth Woodworth was appoi nted to the 
Student Center Board. Lisa Stenmark pointed out that a temporary appotntment 
might be a better idea, so that other students could get involved. Stenmark then 
made a motion to make a temporary appointment; it was seconded, but 
discussion continued. Audrey Thompson, representative from Warren College, 
wantt:d to vote the normal way, and with the suggestion of Stenmark that a 
committee of three be appointed to make appointments, Woodworth was 
approved temporarily by the committee. Then a vote was taken on the 
committee that Stenmark had previously suggested. The motion failed ten to

Parking Hell: No 
hope for salvation 
By JAMES RALPH PAPP 

Since I have been going to UCSD I 
have lived in a rarified atmosphere by 
commuting on the bus. Jt was not until 
this last Thursday, when I drove the car 
here with the confidence of one who 
knew parking pennits were not yet 
required. thaI I rcalized the Hell through 
which driwrs go every morning. 
(Perhaps PurgalOry would haw been the 
better metaphor, bill at least there the 
oons1allt SIlUI!IIe has the hope of 
salvation at the end). 

It was not as if the parking 
experimu was entirely bad. I left my 
car In a wry ~tty grove of eucalypws 
trees which I had never seen before. 
The walk toWard the colleges brought 
me cloKr to nature. As I plodded aver 
the raw earth I looked through the green 
tI'CCS, their leaws wet with the rain. at 
the birds, squirrels, rabbits. the one or 
two coyoces, and what may haw been a 
mounrain lion. The view of Central 
Ubrary was 1000ely as I rappelled down a 
cliff, and I was fortunate at the bottom 
10 discover some old Indian remains 
(Ravi Shankar records, that sort of 
thing). 

In mllh, the rain, although it made 
the flora lovelier. was a negative aspect 
of the hike. I had naively neglected 10 
bring 'either my foul weather gear or my 
backpacking equipment, and the little 
gully which divides "remote" parking 
from the rest of the campus was swollen 

and dimcult to traverse. or would have 
been had a Chevrolet not been washed 
iOlO it. making a temporary footbridge (I 
was the second to last person to use it 
before it was SWept down to the sea). 

The rain started up again when I was 
five minutes from my car.wh~ I had 
left my muffier and avercOllt. I did nO( 
want to go th~ and return, thus taking 
15 minUlCS 10 walk a third of the way 10 
the outskirts of the Uniwrsity proper. 
When I was ten minutes from the car it 
sraned 10 rain hard: 30 minutes 10 walk 
two ·thirds of the W8¥. By the time I Ft 
to Central my health and my trouser 
crease were both permanendy damaged. 
My destination was Rewle. 

I finished my classes with the 
dismaying realization that while I was in 

. the middle of civilization. my car was 
sitting 15 minutes away from iL As I 
made my way back, my Oashlight 
reflected in the eyes of the mounrain 
lion a few yards away. It was a narrow 
escape for me but nO( for him. The next 
day James Watt announced that he was 
leasing the remote parking lot for oil 
driBing. 

What are the answers to the parking 
problem? The students' answer is 
outrage and protest, the !-' niversity's 
answer is thousands in expenditures on 
new lots, and the surrounding 
businesses and residents' answer is 
increased policing. My answer is taking 
the bus again.

Housing rip-off at UCSB 
While Students at UCSD face a 

COOSlant hOUSing struule with the. 
high cost of living in the immediate 
campus area, some students at UC 
Santa Barbara recently lost their 
precious rent dollars to an unusual 
housmg scam. 

Eleven UCSB students lost nearly 
53000 in an apartment scandal that 
left them without housing for the start 
of the school year, according to an 
article published last Friday in the Los 
Angeles Times. 

From Santa Barbara County 
Sheriffs Depanment sources, the 
Times reported "Students were taken 
in by a man who oITered to rent an 
apartment in the Isla Vista area near 
the campus. In each case, the man 
required the students to pay the 
first and last months' rent, 
amounting to 5350. plus an 
additional $150 deposit." 

The article goes on to say that 
the scandal was uncovered when 

one of the students, an 18 year old 
freshman, arrived at the apartment 
to move in and found OUt from the 
manager that the man had had no 
authority to rent the apal!mem and 
that it had already been legitimately 
rented to someone else. Apparently 
the man who had shown the 
apartment to the II out-of-Iuck 
students had sublet the location for 
the summer. 

Ten other students went to 
authorities with the same story, and 
four had arrived at the apartment 
before the man had left and were 
able to recover their money with the 
help of the manager. The rest did 
not, a sheriffs spokesman told the 
Times. 

The Times states that the Sheriffs 
Department is looking for lhe man 
who they believe has also been 
involved in rental car scams and 
stealing bicycles.

Editorial 

Those nasty labs: Removing them from DC 
jurisdiction won't fIx the nuclear problem 

The University of California is composed of nine campuses spread 
through the central and southern portions of the state, but its 
boundaries (and its influence) extend far beyond these . The Lawrence 
Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories (which are credited 
with having developed 65% of all major nuclear weapons in stockpile in 
the u.s. today) are both managed by UC and have been since scientists 
at Los Alamos developed the Fat Man and Little Boy nuclear bombs that 
were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This relationship with 
nuclear weap<?nry has sparked a great deal of controversy among 
students, faculty and management, but its nature is little understood. 

.. Many people have expressed revulsion at the idea of a university 
involving itself in the business of weapons design, and many others 
have protested on different grounds. DC Santa Cruz Chancellor Dr. 
Roben L. Sinsheimer, in a written statement endorsed by 300 faculty 
members, assened that, "It is in the national interest that the University 
fulfill a special role in American society, but involvement in nuclear 
weapons ... seems to stand in direct contradiction to [thatj role." 

Dr. John Jungerman, who is now chairman of UC Davis' Physics 
Depanment, worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II . 
Today, however, he is questioning the wisdom of UC's management of 
Los Alamos and its Sibling, Lawrence Livermore. "My own experience in 
the labs," Jungerman says, "has shown that it is a good environment for 
creative work, and there are those who say that it is the University'S 

n~tional ,?bligation to carry out weapons re~arch, ... but' respectfully 
dIsagree. One thIng that angers Jungerman IS that those who work in 
the fabs must pass a comprehensive security clearance. thus effectively 
prohibiting those who are not American citizens from working on 
projects related to national security. "The secrecy of these operations 
does not fit into an academic environment," he says. 

Here we have a prominent scientist, one who was involved in 
developing the first nuclear bomb, who would like to see his university 
divest itself of the labs. Add to that the fact that he is but one of rnany 
who are striving toward this end , and we come to the obvious question: 
how did the University of California get involved in this in the first 
place? More important, perhaps, and cenainly more relevant today, is 
the question: why is UC still involved in the development of nuclear 
weapons? 

From the outset it must be understood that UC did not leap 
enthusiastically .into weapons development. The Manhattan Project was 
undenaken dunng an unprecedented two-front war in which young 
men were dying in numbers not seen since the Civil War. When the 
nuclear bomb was given the go-ahead, UC was approached to take on 
the project both for its skill in research management and for its healthy 
poor of scientists. Under the circumstances, a denial was vinually 
unthinkable. 

After the war had ended , however, the ball was not only rolling but 
picking up momentum. The <;,:old War and the Space Race both did 
their pan to spur the government into spending ever-increasing 
amounts of money on nuclear development and the labs where this . 
development is carried out. Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore have 
thus prospered for four decades, and it is now estimated that between 
60 and 80% of the research they carry out is in some way related to 
defense. 

Drs. Sindheim and Jungerman both have good reasons lor loathing 
the labs, but what are the alternatives? los Alamos and Lawrence 
Livermore are undeniably the nation 's preeminent weapons labs, but 
they are by no means alone. Among the other federally funded National 
Laboratories are Sandia (with three facilities in as many states) , which is

Recruitment of Discussion 
"The ilderness & 

managed by Western Electric (a subsidiary of AT&T), and Oakridge, 
which operales under the auspices of the Union Carbide Corporation. '" 
don't know about you," one VC employee said to me recently, "but I feel 
a lot more comfortable with these labs being run by Universities than by 
some conglomerate." 

This bnngs us to the final qUestion~hY operate these labs at all? It 
is, at best, an extraordinaril expensiv way to plOl our demise and, at 
worst, some diabolical sin that will se us shrieking into oblivion. The 
solution lies in equal part in Washington and in Moscow; the simple act 
of "getting UC out of the weapons business" will not make the problem 
go away.

Angel looks northward, but he's not alone 
By CHRISTOPHER ENGHOLM 

Coming inro Mexico you feel uneasy 
about taking their money, but if you didn't 
make your livelihood crossing the 
border at Nogales, Mexicali , or Tijuana, 
you'd have 10 feel uneasy or immoral or 
ashamed about some other livelihood. 
After all, you are doing them a favor, 
aren't you, and they reimburse you for 
aD the risks you take and for geuing 
them out of aD their trouble. 

the hiring of undocumented workers 
has made a mockery of United States 
immigration laws. Deponing illegal 
aliens and making a concened effon 10 
restrict illegal entry into the United 
States raises fears that the economy of 
the Southwest might collapse out of a 
lack of cheap labor. On th~ other hand, 
iIIegals willing to work lor minimum 
wage in the United States are taking 
jobs needed by many of the 10% of 
Americans out of work, mainly young 
people jusl entering the labor market. 
Recently, when the House of 
Representatives rejected sanctions 
against employm who hire iBegaJs, they 
may have been influenced by th~ fact 
that Mexican fann laborers are vital to 
the success of American-owned, 
multithousand-acre agribusinesses that 
stretch from the San Joaquin VaUey to 

bullring iii the dark , shul down the 
engine and waited in the gloom. 

It was easy to see wh, Angel wanted 
10 work in America. HIS ahernative in 
San Bias was growing rruil and 
vegetables for local villagers and earning 
500 pesos a week. In the Uniled StateS 
he earns nearly 1.000 pesos an hour as 
a framer on hOUSing construclion sites. 
He said in San Bias 1\ takes a month to 
make enough money to buy a shin and 
a pair of shoes. He also resented the 
bureaucrats of Ihe PRI, caUing them 
corrupt thieves who steal from the poor 
and who have ruined Mexico. This 
crossing he was planning to Stay in 
California and raise a family. life in 
America would be easier for Angel than '. 
for the Mexicans who came before him. 
His children can now enjoy free public 
schooling and health care without 

We localed Angel, age 19, from San 
Bias, at a lilll~ cantina near th~ bullring 
in Tijuana al 10 o'clock Saturday night 
in response to his phone caU an hour 
earlier. Two very severe-looking-Mexican 
Imigra officm were with him, both 
armed with the typical, archaic riOes, 
which can kiD just as effectively as an 
M-16 at close range. Outside on the 
street I presented one of them with 
eighty donars as a "mordida," or bribe, 
while the ()(her !lCrupuiously searched 
our autobus for valuables. but we had 
prepared for this by stripping the 
vehicle of everything except that 
necessary for its basic operation. In 
Spanish, authoritatively, Angel was 
warned about crossmg the rtver again 
thaI night. The two officers then 
disappeared into Ihe cantina. 

On the Mexican side of the border, 
Imigra olTicers are essentiaUy roaming 
mdividualisis menacing those wanting 
to cross the border 10 work in the 
United States, visit family, or escape 
their Impovcnsned villages. The poltcy 
of the PRI-controlled government of 
Mexico has been to view the advem of 
illegal immigration of Mexicans into the 
United States as a lemporary solution to 
Mexico's 50% "underemployment," a 
way of siphoning off surplus 
malcontents. 

On the Mexican side of the border, 
Imigra -officers are essentially roaming 
individualists menacing those wanting to 
cross the border to work in the United 
States, visit family, or escape t~eir 
impoverished villages. 

In the United States. the Issue of 
illegal immigration has become urgent 
and complex. Operations "Intercept" 
and "Condor" have been implemented 
successfully along the 1952-mile border 
to stop alien tralTic. The Border Patrol 
has smce been put m the poSition of a 
scapegoat by Washington, which refuses 
to properly outfit border stations. In EI

Angel Anemlo Gonzalez lay on the

"What happened to you?" I asked. 
"One of them struck me with a rifle

"Whal do you want to do now that

having to divulge the Citizenship of 
Iheir parems. 

About a third of the MeXican aliens 
working in the Stales at this lime also 
intend to become pennanent residents. 
It is predicted that the flow of immigrams 
won't subside until the difference in 
wage levels between the countries is 
reduced and the need for unskilled 
labor declines. 

Angel got up off the floor of the 
autobus, looked out onto the darkened 
street and opened the door. He moved 
across the street, hunkered down like a 
combat soldier, to the beach that 
connects Mexico and Amenca when Ihe 
tide is low. "I will swim and walk on the 
beach ," was the last thing he said. 

We drove up the new road thai 
climbs the tne\lQ,tain overlooking the 

vast sea 01 amber lightS and freeways 
that make up nighttime San Diego: We 
crossed the border (avoiding secondary 
inspection) aod entered San Ysidro, 
California. 

San Ysidro is one of the hybrid towns 
along the border being inexorably 
altered by the ever-growing numbers of 
Hispanics in its midst. Main Street is 
marked by a string of "Casas de 
Cambio," makeshift money changers 
symptomatic of the peso bemg aUowed 
to float in value according to its strength 
against international currencies. Datsun 
and Bank of America advenisements 
appear in Spanish, the music you hear 
is "None no," and the celebration up the 
street is a "quinceanera". On the 
sidewalk, language converges into a 
kind of esperanto that sounds 
melodious like Spanish and staccato like 
English simultaneously. 

But border biculturalism doesn't stop 
here. Los Angeles has become the 
second largest Hispanic city in the 
world , where one out of five hospital 
palients is an iUegal alien from Mexico. 
In every non-technical way, the United 
States-Mexico border is pushing its way 
northward back toward ilS pre-1848 
posilion at the 42nd parallel. Here is a 
bell of land, once two-fifths of Mexico's 
territory. rapidly being repopulated, 
redefined. and . in Santa Fe and San 
Amonio , even regovemed by Hispanic 
people. In Mexico they say It's divine 
justice. 

You reach lhe end of the road in the 
soulhweslern comer of America al 
Imperial Beach and look out into Ihe 
black surf breaking on a misty beach , 
then upwards at far-off helicopters 
perusing the marshy shores about the 
Tijuana River wilh their searchlighlS and 
infrared telescopes. You believe you see 
him. but It was not he , tcn limes before 
you know that it is he . far away down 
the beach, staying very lo~ to the sand, 
nOl sure it is really you or an officer. He 
comes closer until finally you and he are 
bolh sure, and he's m-ade it to America, 
and you say "Congratulations, Angel, 
you've made it to Mexamerica!" And the 
autobus stans right up , no problems. 
Whew!

Finding sexual identity 
difficult for students 
By DENA ROSEN 

An ongoing support/ counseling group 
designed primarily for gay or bisexual 
men who are struggling with their sexual 
identity will be offered by Steve Brady, a 
psychologist with Counseling and 
Psychological Services, thiS Wednesday 
at Ihe Humanttles Library BUilding, 
Room J003, from 10 (Q [1 :30 a.m. 

Brady. who has worked In vanous 
capacIties in the psychotherapy held for 
eight years. feels that suc h a group is 

The "coming out" process can be a 
very painful o ne, "like a second 
adolescence ," according to Brady, who 
has worked extensively with gay student 
o rgani za ti ons at UC Santa Barbara and 
with the Lesbian and Gay Organization 
(LAGO) here . Those with gay or bisexual 
tendenCies wJiI ofren be aware of them 
yet pressured to appear hererosexual in 
their public life . The support / counseling 
group will ask Ihe questions, "Who am 

Such a group is needed here at UCSD, because it is at 
the college age when one must cO'nsolidate his or her 
sexual identity_ 

needed here at UCSD , because, "It is at 
the college age when one must 
consolidate hiS or her sexual identity." 
For the estimated 10% primarily gay 
adults on campus this is additionally 
difficult , because they must also face the 
social stigma of their homosexuality. 
This will be the third year that Brady 
will lead the confidential , closed group 
oITered for men who know they are 
homosexual as well as for those who 
suspect they may be. 

I?" and ' Where do 1 belong?" to 
facilitate the srudents' understanding of 
their sexual identity. As pan of his work 
toward a doctorate in counseling 
psychology, Brady theorizes that there 
are three elements composing one's 
se xual identity. 'They are (1) the 
perception of self and of feelings, (2) 
the perception of behavior or actions 
and (3) the perception of what others 
think about one's sexuality. The struggle 
is to integrate these three elements into

Brady says that the feeling of 

belonging, of being accepted In society. 
is important for homosexuals: "For most 
people the central task in life is feeling 
that they belong, and gay people are no 
exception to thaL" 

The main point is that there are

Another Sun God 
to be unveiled? 

By SUSANN COKAl 
UCSD's Sun God is joined today by 

another distinctive sculpture: a life-Sized 
bronze statue of a mestizo woman. 
FranCISCO Zuniga's "Yucateca Sentada" 
("Seated Woman of the Yucatan") will be 
installed on the lawn by the Third 
College Provost'S Office at 2:00 this 
afternoon . Chancellor Richard Atkinson ' 
and Third College Provost Faustina Solis 
will be speaking at the ceremony. 
Refreshments will be available . 

Elsa Dekking and UCSD physics 
professor Keith Brueckner are donating 
the statue to the university; the school 
pa ys only for the tiled base and the 
installation. While cost estimations were 
not available , no state funds are being 
used. The couple selected the Third 
College site because of the college's 
Interest in the development of the Third 
World countries and because Zuniga is 
a renowned Mexican anist whose 
subjects are Latin American. Before its 

donation , the statue was pan of Dekking 
and Brueckner's private collection. 

The "Yucateca" presents Zuniga's view 
of the Mexican mestizos' life: the 
elemental , immutable quality and sense 
of calm and loneliness. Central to all of 
the anist's work is the theme of "being, 
not doing: or passive existence. His 
style is, appropriate to his subjects, a 
clean, realistic one based on - but not 
a copy of - Pre-Columbian and 
medieval simplicity. While establishing 
that style, Zuniga worked for the 
Mexican government to ornament 
architecture with sculpture , which he 
feels is the sculptOr's true purpose. He 
regretted ceasing to take commissions; 
he wants to make all hi s work accessible 
to the public, nor only to private 
collectors . He should be glad to know 
that his "Yucateca Sentada" is now on 
public display and enhancing the 
architectural beauty of UCSD.

Tom Tucker takes over as head of SC 
By DAVID PARKER 

Could you tell u) a little about how you 
gOI slartcd In Ih,s type of Job and about 
your e 'q'tllt'ncc to datt'o 

Tucker. I came to the UCSD campus, 
began work September 15th , and my 
prevIous job was as d irector 01 Ihc 
Campus enter, ,1 fac ility named the 
"MoumaInLair," West Virgima UniversllY 
in Morgantown , Wesl Virginia. And that 
was a campus of about 22,000 studentS . 
It's a state land-grant institution. We 
had one of the fineSt university cemer, 
student ullion, campus cemer, whatever 
you want to call them , wllh 7 ,(}()() events 
per year. I was the responsible person 
for coordinating Staff developmem for 
1,100 or so student affairs employees. 

You will find me very student-
oriented - in fact , very campus-oriented 
to aU constituencies. I think that all the 
areas I am responsible for are service 
organizations. 

50 how was this student center run, by 
the adnllntstration or a body of student 
representatives? 

Tucker. I was responsible for the 
entire operation as the administrative 
officer. Very autonomous. One of the 
more enjoyable jobs, probably, in the 
Slare of West Virginia, in the sense that 
I got to spend a great deal of time with 
students. 

Could you give us some infonnalon 
about your personal history and education? 

Tucker. I have three degrees: BA, 
master's, and doctorate. My 
undergraduate degree is in education. I 
taught on the secondary school level , 
English , a couple of years , way back 
when, in the late 1960's. I have a 
master's degree in educational 
administration and my doctorale is in 
higher education administration, with a 
minor in pubUc administration. 
Family? 

Tucker. Got married. Wife's name , 
Ruth . No children at this point -
something we're contemplatmg. Ruth is 
also a native West Virginian , from 
around Charleston. We've ... I have 
been to San Diego a couple of times, 
previously, for a conference or two and 
was nC't in the job market , per se, at all , 
very happy at what I was doing and 
very, very effective. Things were geuing 
rather easy to accomplish at WV. I kl1ew 
most people on campus and a 101 of 
those around the State; pick up the 
telephone and get about anything done. 

I was ready for . .. a new chaUenge , and· 
I thought we had some unique 
opponuhiries here. 

Dr. Tucker has entertd a poSition that 
has bun filkd and vacated four times in 
the last four years, Although its parameters 
have been slightly expanded to make the 
job more attractive (aU of the top thru 
applicants in Ihe last job search lumed It 
dOWll after finding out the limilations and 
difficulties), his basic dilemma still exists 
between lalling orders from the 
administrarion and being responsible to Ihe 
students, whuse "Iaxes " (lhe Sludent 
Center fee) he is spending. His affable 
lIlarmer and easy drawl may l10t close all 
the old wounds. 

Ramifications of past conflicts will be 
a.Decting you and your job in very big ways, 
and ill that sense they are particularly 
Imp.mam. When Ihe AS votcd on Issues 
last year their authority was not usurped by 
Ihe adminiSlralion. The Student Center 
Board has, in the past, voted on issues and 
been contradicted by the administratIOn . 
What do you plan to alltJld Juture conflict? 

Tucker. I am trying over the next 
couple of weeks to give as much time 
with the Student Center people, with 
the AS people , to understand the system

as much as poSSible. For example, AS 
President Craig Lee and the Student 
Center Ikprd attend our Staff meetjngs . 

I knew that it would be a chaUenge. 
That sounds idealistic, but I really 
believe it wiD work. I think, at some 
point, with enthusiasm, with quality of 
service, and with a doctrine of fairness 
and reaching out to the campus 
community, that these devisive kinds of 
decisions will be worked out within the 
commiuee and between the staffs ... 
We11 have a central direction , a shared 
concept of what we are trymg to do for 
the campus, and a shared objective. 

What you're saying to me is that the 
first time the Student Center Board 
wants to do something . . . and 
somebody else wants to do something 
else , what will happen? I can't answer 
t hat for you. 

Well, when you 're hired for a job, one of 
the first Ihmgs that you want to find OUI is 
what are the limits of your a I4t1lOrity; whom 
do you ha~'t to answer ,o? 

Tucker. My reporting agency IS to Joe 
Watson, vice chancellor 01 student affairs. 
1 am not here , have not been brought 
here. by Vice Chancellor Watson or 

anybody else to be the expert's expert, 
to dc-emphaSize the role of the Student 
Cenrer Board I am a Stong believer m 
the role of advisor councils and the role 
of governing b03rds and campus center 
concepts. I'll give you an example: I 
neve r had to go to Ihe president with a 
ruling when I differed with the tudent 
Center Boa rd and WV. To me, I think 
that if I'm here to help operate the 

. building, and they Ithe ASI to look after 
student interests and allocate funds, and 
we assist each other . . . we may 
disagree, but surely we can work it out. 
If not, I would assume that there would 
be somebody to make a decision , but I 
don't see us geuing there , and certainly 
not very often. I see this as a new 
dawning here, and I want to approach it 
that way. I want the Student Center 
Board to be functional. Don't want them 
to be weak. Don't want them not to 
meet. Don't want one person to have to 
speak with them. for them. But I think 
that means that we'll be mutual 
resources, get things done. I don't see us 
as adversaries. Why would we be 
adversaries when we're here for the 
same reason? 

Let's imagint you 'w: got a S/uc/t:nr anla 
board Ihat IS voting one way, across the 
board, (omplettly in opposition to what 
you 've been ordutd to do. Whert do you 
go from Ihere? 
Tucka: If we get to that point, and I am 
nOl astute enough to have seen it 
coming, and I didn't go to the 
administration and 5a¥, now, students 
feel strongly about th is and it's nOl that 
important ... or I didn't ·go to the 
students and say, weU now, here is the 
legal reason why we can't do this . , , is 
there another avenue, let's go around 
the bend, compromise. If I got to that 
pOint, I didn 't do my job. If people were 
getting to that point before, the 
leadership role of the assistant VC for 
university center was not being formed 
well. Simple as that . . . If I got there by 
surprise, I'd say, "Hold it. Back up"; I 

'could talk to everybody concerned, 
maybe get them aU together, What I'm 
saying is, I'm an outreach of the Student 
Center Board. I'm an outreach of the 
administration , and they have aU said , 
"Tom, come here and let's accomplish 
major missions together," and I intend 
to do that, and I intend to negOliate, 
compromise.

Chasing 
a 

Mirage 
I flick the switch. The fluorescent tubes Dutter, then flash on , filling the bathroom 

with their cold, white light. I rum and face the mirror, afraid of what I know I'll see. 
"Geez, I look like shit," I think to myself as I climb IntO the shower to begin the 

beautification process. I wash and scrub, trying desperately to change my motley mug 
into one of those gorgeous faces in the magazines. It never works. After aU the lather 
has been washed away, I'm always left with the same Imperfect face . The realization of 
this always leaves me feeling a bit insecure and unhappy. 

My flaws bother me. AU my life I've been tOld that I should be ashamed of my 
physical defects and that I need to attain a cenain idyllic beauty if I ever want to be 
happy. . 

The standards are set by the taU, thin . handsome people we idolize on TV or in the 
movies. They are made out to be enlightened beings, untouched by the troubles and

ugliness that we sometimes fInd in our itves. They are always smIling and seem to have 
nothing but fun. Look at the people in the Cigarette ads, at Christie Brinkley or those 
crazy kids on the beach in those Sunkist commercials. They don't worry about who 
they are . 

So I strive to be more lIke them. With the hope of gaining their peace of mind. Yet 
as hard as I try , I can't ever get the impeccable good looks of the model humans in the 
ads. I buy all the products that are supposed to give me their full-bodied hair, straight 
white teeth and unending happiness, but I can't seem to get away from my imperfect 
life. Instead of becoming happier, I'm left frustrated and unfulfilled. 

The idea that we have to change who we are in order to find perfect beauty and 
happiness is an illusion. We aU faU shon of perfection in some way. Trying to gain 
physical perfection is as futile as trying to draw an absolutely round circle. It can't be 
done, because it is merely an intellectual concept. We all deviate from our idea of the 
model human being in some way. No de,,jation is any better than the other, just as the 
number two is no closer to infinity than the number one. We are bound to lead 
unsatisfying lives as long as we continue to believe fantasy is better than reality. 

I will never be content with my own life until [ realize that my imperfect happiness 
is nOt due to my imperfect appearance. I can't believe the people who teU me that my 
pal1icular defects are bad and that I should strive for a perfection that doesn't exist. I 
can't worry about the things I'm not when I should be enjoying the things I am. I won't 
ever find happiness until I learn to appreciate the beauty in myself and StOp chasing 
the mirage of idyllic perfection.

By KIM HADDAD 
Whoever says that UCSD lacks the 

excitement of athletic competition is not 
familiar with Its infamous intramural 
program, Some of the most thriDing and 
bizarre sponing events at UCSD are 
'developed through the 1M depanment. 
Whett else can one watch footbaD 
teams like "York Hunt Club: 'Chocolate 
City," or "bides for Allah' compete for 
the AM Division Championship? 

As such, intramurals provide a unique 
source of athletic activity as weD as a 
much-needed outlet for academic 
frustration, In a university whett 
intercollegiate sports playa relatively 
smaU role. the desperate need to 
recreate is fulfilled by the wide variety of 
sports olTemi through the 1M 
Depanment. 

It is precisely this variety and 
uniqueness that stimulates so much 
interest among the students. In fact. past 
records indicate that up to 300 softbaR 
teams Wett formed within a single 
season. Similar enthusiasm is expressed 
with up to 200 basketbaU teams. 150 
footbaD teams. and 100 each of hockey, 
inner·tube water polo, and voileybaU 
teams, With so many teams involved, 
the degree of competition reaches some 

rather intense levels, especiaUy in the 
AM. Division. 

In the socialy sta/Ved atmosphere 
prevailing at UCSD, students need a 
way to unify themselves with others and 
their beloved university. lM's create this 
sense of unity among team members. 
especialy ~ the competitiveness 
mounts dunng playolTs. 

To insure fairness and equal 
competition, the teams are divided into 
subdivisions of A. AA. and AM. the last 
representing the highest level of 
competition. Such a method of 
organization also increases the 
attractiveness of lM's by encouraging 
everyone from the novice to the 
advanced to get out and play. Coed 
leagues are also progeny of the 1M 
Depanmcnt and aUow for some rather 
entertaining games in a more relaxed 
atmosphere. Both coed and women's 
team panicipation have grown 
significantly, primarily due to Ihe 
resurgence of public interest in physical 
fitness. 

But for those of you w,ho prefer spons 
for individuals. don't fret. The 1M 
Depamnent has many special events to 

tum to 16

well as many newly orgamzed teams. In 
the M Division we can look forward to 
the thrilling games of Sandy and 1M 
BIggers, BStJ, Razor Backs, and S_mp. 
Due to the large size of the men's A 
Division and the entry of many new 
teams, our source was unable to 
speculate on this season's favorites. 

As you walk around with the haze and glaze of the quarter's quandry don't forget to 
treat yourself to a sample of the many recreation clubs a~i1able on campus. The 
Recreation Club Program is made up of a number of speCIal Interest clubs that are 
recreationaDy oriented. All students, faculty and staff are encouraged to join the club or 
clubs of their choice to gain a needed break from the rigors of academic and 
professional life. .. 

Organizational meetings for some of the recreation clubs WIll be ~ld ~t various 
times throughout this week. Contact laurel Dean at x4037 for munng times and 
further information. Intramural spons at UCSD have 

become somewhat of a tradition among 
many of the participating players. 
Several of the teams reappear year after 
year, perpetuating battles. A Significant 
part of this tradition involves the crucial 
team-naming ritual; it is apparent that 
serious and creative thought went into 
the genesis of some rather original 
names. 

In hockey, Critters, the AM. champs, 
should be extremely wary of Capcain 
Dick and His Seamen Get Her Peas, 
while in M, Puck Me in the Ear will 
have to battle against RISK lker Slalom. 

~rossword answers 
from pagt 19 

This year's football fans will be happy 
to know that the defending champs in 
men's AM., York Hunt Club wiD be up 
against returning pre-season favorites 
like Plain Wrap Prophylactics, 

In other sports we can also look 
forward ' to exciting matches as 
defending champions baule it out 
against last year's finalists. Don't forget 
to keep an eye OUt for upcoming special

Running 'Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG cSt JEFF SAVAGE 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. While anending the PE 120 class, Sports in 
America (for observational purposes only), we were rather surprised at the reaction of 
the class to a SJatement made by Professor John H. Douglass. The UCSD Intercollegiate 
AthletiCS Department recently began cha~in~ a dollar to students for various sporting 
events in the Pavilion. Douglass claimed that it is unfair to ask students to pay 
admission for home sporting events, and the class strongly agreed . What a bunch of 
hypOCrites! Many of these are the same people who complain about the poor state of 
the IA Department. and yet when it comes down 10 asking them to do something 
about it (like parting with a measly dollar), they grumble and groan. 
NOT TO BE BEUEVED DEPT. Continuing along the same lines, the revenues 
generated from these events have been earmarked by Athletic Director Judy Sweet for 
publicity purposes. That seems sensible to us, bUI only on the surface. It turns out that 
Sweet's idea of promotion is a half-page ad in the Guardian entitled "The Athletic 
Auic ," which is nothing more than a cheap hype job. We're not saying that the ad is a 
bad idea, mind you, but the advenisement is written in a story format similar to other 
informative anicles in the Guardian. Is it really necessary to be repetitive? Surely Sweet 
can find more productive things to channel the funds into. Why spend a lot of money 
on an ad when the Guardian gives the same information for free? The lA's priorities are 
in good order; unfortunately their methods are second-rate. 
ON THE AIRWAVES DEPT. Why is it that San DIego radio sports pcrsonahties try to 
entertain their listeners instead of inform them? Perry Allen, Ted Leitner and John 
DeMont are three prime examples. Allen , sports director of KOGO, is so inept at what 
he does that it is amazing that he works in as large a media market as San Diego 
(ranked 27th na!lonally). His "open mouth on sports" rendition In the aflemoon will 
go down in infamy in the minds of San Diegans who have to put up with his malarky 
every day. Leitner, meanwhile, although certainly the brightest personality in town, has 
an ego the size of Mount Rushmore. Why in the world do we have to know that many 
Dodger fans sickened him when he was speaking at ~ an Diego State last night? Are we 
supposed to reaDy care what Ted Leitner does in his ,pare time? As for DeMont, the 
sports direclOr for KSDO is as pathetiC a sports announcer (he does Charger play-by-
play) as he is a public addresser at Padre games. Durmg last Sunday'S Chargers-Browns 
game, DeMont described Wes Chandler's brilliant IOU hdown catch as an incomplete 
pass. After realizing his error (and he was in no hUll) to do so), DeMont said, "And 
Chandler sure had your Charger announcer faked our on that one." Cmon John. 

NEXT QUESTION PLEASE DEPT. Answer to Thur.-day's question: Who were the 
top three running backs in pro football history who wore the number 32? Jim Brown, 
Franco Harris, and OJ Simpson. Today's question: In what year did UCSD win its first 
national championship , what was the sport, and who was the captain who was voted 
the nation's MVP?

Coming off a big victory at La Verne Thursday, the UCSD women's volleyball team returned 
home to Triton Pa.,.;lion Saturday evening to do bailIe with Division II, 10th ranked 
Champman College. After winning the Jirst game of the best of Jive match 15-10, the Triton 
spilurs suddenly lost their rhythm and dropped the next two games by the scores of 15-10 
and 15-8. After falling behind 9-5 in the fourth game however, UCSD began passing the ball 
well. As they got their transition game going with Karin Kalk and Krislin Kilbourn, they were 
able to set up Molly Wheatley and Debbie Doran in one-on-one Situations, and eventually win 
the game and even up the match at two games apiece. In the crucial fifth game, UCSD simply 
outhustled a tired Chapman squad to win the game 16-14 and the match three games to two. 
After an 0-7 start, the team has won 14 of its last 17 matches and is currently ranked 
number one In Division /II in the nation. Above, Debbie Doran and Karin Kalk go up to stuff a 
Chapman spike.
