IllUSTRATION By JANE RHO

Student Regent Resigns Due to “Personal Reasons”

By Laira Martin
News Editor

New revisions to the Student 
Code of Conduct would extend 
the student appeal process 
with the addition of a coun-
cil of provosts, if the changes 
are approved and enacted by 
January 2012. 

The new code is the result 
of a work group created by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue in May 2009. After 
two years of research, the 
group released a 15-page draft 
and is now soliciting student 
and faculty feedback before 
reevaluating the draft in Fall 
2011 and putting the changes 

into place. 
“The code was shortened 

from about 30 pages to 15 
pages,” work group member 
and Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Arohi 
Sharma said. “I think that says 
a lot. Because it was too long, 
students weren’t reading it. 
[Some felt] it was too verbose.”

The code — which was last 
revised Aug. 29, 2008 — covers 
student discipline-related issues 
such as suspension, expulsion 
and the appeals process. 
Prominent changes to the code 
include a new introduction 
which cites the “Principles of

Work Group Revises Student Conduct Code

By Sarah Kang
Staff Writer

Student Regent Jesse Cheng, who has 
served since July 2010, resigned from 
his position on Monday, May 16 due to 
“personal problems.” UC Board of Regents 
Chairman Russell Gould released a state-
ment the same day accepting Cheng’s 
resignation and announcing that Student 
Regent-designate Alfredo Mireles Jr. will 
assume a voting position, effective imme-
diately.

In an open letter posted on the UC 
Regents blog on May 16, Cheng said that 

the accusation made 
against him was 
becoming a distrac-
tion in the Board of 
Regents. He spoke 
more on this matter 
in an interview with 
the Guardian.

“If I stayed [as] 
the Student Regent, 
I’d pretty much be 

a lame duck,” Cheng said. “And there’s no 
point in having a lame duck [as a] Student 
Regent.”

Cheng was arrested on Nov. 4, 2010 

after an anonymous 22-year-old UCLA 
Law School student, “Laya,” accused him 
of having sexually assaulted her on Oct. 
3, 2010. Criminal charges were initially 
dropped due to lack of evidence until 
Laya provided email evidence in which 
Cheng, her former partner, apologized for 
attempting to rape her. Cheng explained 
that he sent the email because she con-
stantly made disruptive phone calls to 
him.

“[The phone calls] were extremely dis-
ruptive and I was extremely stressed out,”

May 18 from 6 to 9 p.m.

U niversity of California campuses may be allowed to ad-just their undergraduate tuition in an effort to help the university adjust to Gov. Brown’s budget cuts.
UC tuition will be $11,124 system-wide starting Fall 2011, 

after the regents raised in-state undergraduate tuition rates last 
November. This is an eight-percent increase over Fall 2010 
rates. Fees for student activities, health, parking and room and 
board will vary by campus.

The proposal would allow each UC campus to determine 
its own tuition a certain percentage either above or below a 
baseline that has yet to be determined.   

“The idea is that you would allow each campus the 
flexibility to go up to a certain percentage,” UC Office of the 
President spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said. “It’s not that [the 
individual campuses] would be able to set their own tuition.”

In November 2010, the regents chose not to endorse the 
staggered tuition proposal when it was included among the 20 
recommendations in UC Commission on the Future report. 
According to the report, the regents felt that staggered tuition 
would place several campuses at a disadvantage due to actual or 
perceived academic “tiering.”

Little formal progress has been made since then — though 

the idea was last discussed 
at the UC Regents’ meeting 
in December — and Vazquez 
said the now-informal 
proposal does not yet include 
concrete numbers.

The plan was last discussed 
at the Dec. 13 UC Regents 
meeting and is being put back on 
the table for discussion at this week’s 
meeting.  

Most state university systems have a 
flagship university, which charges higher 
tuition than the others.   The University of Texas 
at Austin and the University of Wisconsin at Madison 
are two of these universities.

“[Differential tuition] is not a new idea,” Vazquez said. “It’s 
something that has been discussed in light of dwindling state 
support.”

The set of budget ideas is in response to the continuing budget 
cuts, now including Gov. Jerry Brown’s $500-million cuts from 
the UC system in his 2011-12 budget proposal. The cut would 

eliminate 
about one-sixth of the 
current state funding.

It is still uncertain how much each campus would charge 
and how they would decide pricing.

UC Board of Regents revisits proposal to allow each campus to set 
its own tuition rates based on factors such as demand, freshmen and 

transfer application rate or yield.

Cyanobacteria Not as Useful in Medicine as Predicted 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Leila Haghighat
Senior Staff Writer

A particular species of marine 
cyanobacteria holds less potential for 
medicinal use than originally thought, 
according to an international study led 
by researchers at the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography at UCSD.

“Marine cyanobacteria of the 
genus Lyngbya are among the richest 
sources of bioactive natural products. 
We need to learn as much as possible 
about these fascinating organisms in 
our search for new drug candidates,” 
Scripps graduate student and paper 
author Adam Jones said.

The recent rise in marine 
biomedicine first prompted the 
researchers to conduct this study. The 
FDA is increasingly approving drugs 
derived from ocean life, such as the 
Prialt and Halaven. L. majuscula, the 
tropical microorganism of interest in 
this study, was previously known to 
produce molecules that could treat 
cancer, malaria and inflammatory 
diseases.

But little is actually known about 
the genetics that give rise to the 
production of potential drugs derived 
from organisms of the Lyngbya genus, 
including L. majuscula.

Jones and postdoctoral fellow Emily 
Monroe of the Gerwick Laboratory 
at Scripps finally cracked the genetic 
code of L. majuscula, completing a 
project that began back in 2005. The 
genome was published on May 9 in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences.

This study marks the first time 
that the genome of a filamentous 
marine cyanobacterium has ever 
been sequenced. A major obstacle to 
sequencing these cyanobacteria has 
been contamination by other bacterial 
strains. Because other bacteria cling 
to the outer sheath of L. majuscula 
and contaminate these samples, the 
researchers had to use both traditional 
and modified methods for DNA 
isolation.

In the modified approach, 
single cells were isolated under the 
guidance of a microscope. The small 

amounts of DNA were then amplified 
using a technique called Multiple 
Displacement Amplification, and 
bioinformatics tools were used to 
eliminate the background noise of any 
contaminating bacterial sequences.

The results revealed an intricate 
network of genes that enable L. 
majuscula to interact with other 
bacteria and adapt to environmental 
conditions. In contrast to previous 
reports, the study also found that 
this strain cannot use atmospheric 
nitrogen in a process known as 
nitrogen fixation, which is necessary 
to synthesize the building blocks of life.

To the researchers’ surprise, the 
marine organism only had eight sets of 
genes dedicated to the biosynthesis of 
molecules that could be potential drug 
candidates.

“Three of these were involved in 
making the molecules we had found 
earlier,” Jones said. “The other five 
sets likely are responsible for making 
new molecules we’ve never seen, but 
follow-up experiments revealed that 
these genes did not appear to be active 

in our culture conditions.”
Still, according to the paper, 35 

percent of all natural products from 
cyanobacteria come from the Lyngbya 
genus alone. Jones foresees using the 
successful isolation techniques from 
this study to sequence the genomes 
of related species and identify which 
species of the Lyngbya genus are 
actually responsible for producing 
molecules useful for human drug 
development.

These larger-than-life council members I’ve been hearing about turned out to be very 
human after all. Case in point: They 
have birthdays, just like the rest of 
us! The council 
sang “Happy 
Birthday” twice, 
and baked goods 
were plentiful 
in the forum 
this Wednesday. 
So much for 
the gloomy 
atmosphere I was expecting.

Public input began with Athletics, 
Recreation, and Sports Facilities 
Advisory Board undergraduate 
representative Anish Bhayani 
announcing that the board has 
approved a sports facility budget for 
the 2011-12 school year. 

Triton TV Station Manager 
Thomas Dadourian showed a 
video produced by the studio and 
talked about the benefits of the 
Triton TV internship program. The 
video, a medley of dramatic music 
and unexplained clips from TTV 
productions, was inspirational, yet 
inexplicable. 

Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Arohi Sharma 
proclaimed the Sun God Festival a 
success for A.S. tabling, after which 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji announced that the new 
California budget is bad news for the 
UC system.

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue then spent 15 
minutes discussing the budget cuts, 
after which council members spent 
15 minutes asking questions. Sixth 
College Senator Cody Marshall 
questioned her about the recent 
firing of a Diversity Development 
Officer, and Rue responded that she 
would not comment on personnel 

matters. Associate Vice President of 
Student Organizations Carli Thomas 
then asked what Rue’s favorite Sun 
God act was. Answer:  Second to 
None in the Midway Tent.

Campuswide 
Senator Karen 
Liang announced 
that the first 
senate meeting 
of the new 
council was on 
Wednesday, and 
that one-on-one 

senate project meetings began this 
week. 

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
announced that Sun God did not 
go over budget and reminded the 
council that there would be more 
upcoming events, such as the Senior 
Send-off Bear Garden at RIMAC 
Arena with a karaoke band.

Muir Senator Elizabeth Garcia 
spoke about the Muir College 
Council’s task force to save CLICS. 

President Alyssa Wing 
announced that the board was 
looking for comments about the new 
Student Code of Conduct booklet, 
and that although UCSD would 
not be in Division I for the next 
period, the council would continue 
to work toward that goal. She also 
announced that next year’s Welcome 
Week will collaborate with Target 
to have the company open its store 
exclusively for UCSD students. 

Associate Vice President of 
College Affairs Leonard Bobbitt 
gave a 15-minute presentation 
on election bylaws, emphasizing 
the need to revise poorly written, 
repetitive bylaws before mid-fall 
quarter in order to prepare for 
election season, after which he gave 
a pop quiz with cookies for prizes. 
Those, and birthday cupcakes, ended.

Legal Language Removed from Student Code of  Conduct
Community” and an altered appeals 
process. 

“The draft code reads that 
appeals will be heard by a council 
of provosts,” Career Services Center 
Director Andrew Ceperley said. 
“So if the students find themselves 
moving to the point of an appeal, that 
appeal will be heard not just by their 
own [college] provost, but by the six 
person council of provosts.” 

Two major points of clarification 
have been made due to feedback 
from administrators, including the 
application of the revised code to 
the entire student community at 
UCSD — undergraduate, graduate 
and professional school students 
included.

“The code has a different tone, 
is less legalistic in language and 
walks through things more clearly,” 
Cara Appel-Silbaugh, Co-Chair 
and Director of Parent and Family 
Relations, said.

Although the work group 

ultimately chose to remove the legal 
language from the code, not all 
members agreed with this decision.

“The student legal services 
section has been taken out of the 
code,” Sharma said. “They tried to 
remove as much legal language from 
the code as possible but I feel that it 
is a disservice to students.”

Additionally, the Student 
Regulations and Revisions 
Committee — which consists of 
students, faculty and staff — will 
now review the code on a need-be 
basis.

“They would, in the past, review 
the code as issues came up when 
a policy question was needed and 
make suggestions for revision,” 
Appel-Silbaugh said. “[Our 
committee] because Vice Chancellor 
Rue felt that from student feedback 
that a real look and consideration 
was needed.”

The work group consists of 24 
faculty and student members from 
A.S. Council, the Graduate Student 

Association and the Council of 
Provosts. 

“Some people [on the work 
group] that Vice Chancellor Rue 
thought would be appropriate and 
contribute to the dialogue [were 
selected],” Appel-Silbaugh said. 
“And some students were identified 
by their dean of students or their 
college council.”

The group held an open forum 
on May 17 and has another 
planned for May 23. The group 
also uses emails from students and 
anonymous feedback via its website 
to evaluate the revised draft. The 
draft is available online at http://
blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/student-
affairs/scc-rw/index.html.  

“The feedback has been largely 
positive,” Ceperley said. “We’re 
going to continue this process in 
the fall term after a quiet summer.”

Cheng wrote in a public statement. 
“So I lied in the emails to do what-
ever I could to move forward with 
my life.” 

Cheng emphasized his innocence 
in the sexual assault case, but the 
Office of Student Conduct deter-
mined on March 10 that Cheng was 
responsible for unwanted touching 
of his former girlfriend and denied 
his appeal. 

As the Office of Student Conduct 
is not a court of law, this was not a 
legal decision. 

In the open letter, Cheng 
expressed his regret for being unable 
to complete his service to the UC 
community. 

“My main focus and motivation 
has always been for students to feel 
that they have a full and power-
ful voice on the Board of Regents,” 
Cheng wrote in the letter. “Seeing 
how it will be my last meeting as 
a Student Regent, and how much 
of a distraction from other seri-
ous student issues that this issue 
has continued to cause, I think it 
would be best for the students and 
the University of California if I step 
down at this time.” 

Cheng said that he waited to 
resign until he was sure Mireles 
would be able to step into his posi-
tion and have a vote immediately.

“This past week, we kind of 
got all our goals and issues either 

accomplished or out of the way, and 
we confirmed that Alfredo would 
get a vote after I left,” Cheng said. 
“Then I felt much better about 
resigning, and I was able to resign 
this past week.”

He added that he didn’t want to 
resign without accomplishing the 
projects on the Board of Regents’ 
agenda. 

Cheng stated that he plans on 
focusing on graduating in June.

“For me, this is a time to focus 
on my academic career again, focus 
on graduation, focus on my family 
and be a student,” Cheng said.

Do you support staggereD 
uC tuition? VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes, it is a fair decision
√  No, tuition should be equal
√  Only if UCSD were cheaper

There’s nothing new about putting a price on prestige, and now, the idea of paying more for a better brand 
is moving to the University of California 
system. Financial problems are old news 
— a reduction in state funding has already 
led to staff layoffs, tuition increases and 
cuts in class offerings, all of which started 
a couple of years ago.  Having exhausted 
these options and already downsized the 
universities to their bare bones (rest in 
peace, CLICS), the UC Board of Regents 
has proposed a new tactic: different tuition 
for different campuses. According to the 
March 9 article in the Los Angeles Times, 
the regents are considering allowing the 10 
UC campuses determine their own under-
graduate tuition within a predetermined 
range, which would result in tuition being 
staggered by “consumer demand.” This idea 
has been used at other large state systems 
— notably the University of Texas system, 
which our very own Mark G. Yudof was 
once president of — and it might make the 
money-crunched schools a few extra bucks, 
but the lack of specificity 

with the proposal 
in general is 

making it 
a weak 
solution 
to deal 
with the 
UC’s 
crip-
pled 

budget.
In lieu of recent funding cuts, Governor 

Jerry Brown proposed in January to reduce 
the UC budget by $500 million in the 
2011-12 state budget. The suggestion of 
staggered tuition is the brainchild of the 
UC Commission on the Future, a panel 
studying UC system reforms. Though the 
concept is still in its early stages, meaning 
there’s few concrete numbers to analyze, it 
still brings up numerous doubts, includ-
ing questions about who would decide on 
rates, how schools would be impacted and 
whether staggered tuition would destroy the 
goal of a unified UC system. 

Currently, undergraduate tuition within 
the UC system costs about $11,618 per year 
at each campus. UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Robert J. Birgeneau suggested that, under 
the new plan, the regents set a midpoint for 
undergraduate tuition and allow campuses 
to vary tuition to 25 percent above or below 
the median. 

This leads to the question of who will 
determine the tuition of each campus. 
According to UC Office of the President 
spokesperson Ricardo Vasquez, the new 
plan would likely have the chancellors of 
the individual universities determining 
the tuition. The exact method of doing 
so — based on how high the demand is 
to attend — is still undetermined, though 
Vazquez said that one possibility is bas-
ing tuition rates on annual freshmen and 
transfer application numbers. Other ways 
demand may be calculated, though it is 

unlikely, given Vazquez’s statement, are by 
U.S. News and World Report ratings, fresh-
men and transfer yield rates or even num-
ber of Nobel Laureates.  

Staggered tuition is not a revolution-
ary idea, but its results have not been very 
promising. Universities in Texas, Wisconsin 
and New York all currently implement this 
system. For example, the Austin campus 
at the University of Texas plans to charge 
as much as $4,900 in tuition and basic stu-
dent fees starting Fall 2011, compared to 
about $3,500 for the El Paso campus. This 
can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy: the 
more tuition UT-Austin charges, proving 
its superiority, the more it can continue to 
attract noted faculty and staff — includ-
ing nine Nobel Laureates — and a more 
national student body. Currently, Austin 
places 45th on the U.S. News and World 
Report’s national universities list. None of 
the other UT schools are highly ranked, 
and while UT Austin maintains strong 
rankings, UT campuses in El Paso and 
Arlington continue to sink in their per-
ceived prestige.  

While this staggered tuition proposal 
would raise more funds for the UC sys-
tem overall that the campuses could share 
— and reward colleges that have greater 
demand — under such a plan, the regents 
may be unable to keep campuses in check. 
Transitioning to this structure now, at a 
time when no school wants to lower tuition

With a sudden windfall of extra revenue, to the tune of $6.6 billion, it looks like 
our state’s 2011 deficit will be, you 
know, a mere $10.8 billion instead 
of the original $15.4 billion sum. It’s 
great news to learn that we suddenly 
have a cool $6 billion to spend as 
we please, but this modest financial 
boon doesn’t mean we can avoid Jerry 
Brown’s plan to pass tax extensions 
and make spending cuts.

Sen. Tony Strickland (R-CA) has 
argued that this early Christmas pres-
ent means spending cuts alone are 
enough to pull us out of the mire, and 
there’s no need for tax increases. State 
Republicans like Connie Conway even 
believe that we can save $300 million 
by eliminating Medi-Cal fraud — an 
extremely optimistic estimate. Their 
Plan B: Save another $400 million by 
transferring prisoner medical care to 
the University of California or to the 
oh-so-cheap private sector healthcare, 
whose costs are continuously rising. 
These solutions, while they seem 
great, are overly optimistic calcula-
tions that distract from the necessary 
drastic cuts.

The Republican budget plan avoids 
tax increases by relying on deep cuts 
to spending for the poor and elderly, 
along with taking one-time funds 
from programs for mental health and 
early childhood improvement. Attacks 
on the old, the poor, babies and those 
with mental disabilities —  all to avoid 
minor tax extensions are outrageous, 
especially since the taxes would still 
be billions below the average level 
collected over the past three decades. 
Ideally, local governments would take 
up the task of helping the poor, but it 
can be assumed that a struggling local 
government will also forsake these 
programs, leaving their constituents 
in the dust. 

Under Brown’s new plan and 
budget though, the extra $6.6 billion 
in revenue means K-12 education 
funding will be increased by $3 bil-
lion, and there will be $2 billion less in 
tax increases. And if these taxes aren’t 
extended, it’s likely that the fee hikes 
we’ve already had won’t be enough to 
stem the bleeding. 

Included in Brown’s budget exten-
sions are a 1-percent sales-tax increase 
and .5-percent vehicle license fee to 
reduce the deficit. Politicians like Sen. 
Sharon Runner (R-CA) argue that 
increasing taxes paves the way for 
more spending. But state governments 
have to end up borrowing anyway 
if tax revenue isn’t enough to fund 
spending. 

Furthermore, the newly revised 
budget still opens the way for eco-
nomic recovery by offering tax incen-
tives for firms to hire. Republicans 
are supportive of hiring incentives 
for businesses as well as sales-tax 
exclusion for firms purchasing new 
equipment. Despite the tax increases 
elsewhere, Brown has smartly encour-
aged businesses to stay.

Tax increases and incentives 
paired with spending cuts will get 
California out of this economic rut. 
Hell, even conservative icon Ronald 
Reagan increased state taxes his 
first year as governor of California. 
If Brown’s budget plan isn’t enacted 
soon, it’s not just bad news for UC 
students, but for California as a 
whole.

It’s been a difficult year for Jesse Cheng. As Student Regent — the sole student representative 
on the 26-member UC Board of 
Regents — the UC 
Irvine senior has been 
fighting for access and 
affordability in a year 
fraught with budget 
cuts and tuition raises. 
He’s also been faced 
with sexual assault 
charges from former 
partner and UCLA 
grad student “Laya,” 
as well as subsequent 
protests from the very 
students he’s supposed to represent. 

Though the Office of Student 
Conduct found Cheng guilty on 
March 10, he has emphasized his 
innocence even in light of his res-
ignation this Monday. But while we 
may never know if the charges are 

true, Cheng’s resignation — and 
acknowledgement of the effect the 
charges have had on his performance 
—  shows his respect for the gravity 

of the position. 
With Student 

Regent-designate 
Alfredo Mireles Jr. 
taking his place imme-
diately, the position 
can now be filled by 
someone who isn’t 
distracted by legal 
woes, and who still 
has the full faith of 
his constituents — 

something Cheng lost in light of the 
accusations against him. Though 
the regents declined to intervene 
in the “personal matter,” students 
organized the statewide “Justice for 
Laya Coalition” to hold protests and 
meetings across the UC system and 
ask top-level administration to hold 

Cheng accountable for his actions.
Cheng should be commended for 

ensuring that Mireles can become a 
voting member immediately without 
a lame-duck period in which there 
would be no student representa-
tion on the board. He had thought 
about resigning earlier, but waited to 
resolve the logistics and make sure 
the position will be in good hands. 

With the UC system struggling 
through a budget crisis — including 
a minimum $500-million cut next 
year — the Student Regent posi-
tion is more important than ever. 
Two years ago, then-Student Regent 
Jesse Bernal was the sole dissent-
ing vote against the 32-percent fee 
hike; Cheng voted against this year’s 
8-percent hike as well. 

This crucial position, and its 
holder, represent one of the few con-
crete ways students can express their 
concerns to the UC governing board, 

and the position needs to be filled by 
someone who can devote his or her 
full attention to the important issues 
at hand and who the students are 
able to work with.

Regent Resignation Was Best Possible Move

  
 

Given Student Regent Jesse Cheng’s recent legal troubles, his May 16 resignation was the wisest move to make in order to show 
his respect for his crucial position.

Cheng’s 
resignation

respect for the

oPINIoN THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

in the face of a shrinking budget, will 
likely create destructive competi-
tion among UC campuses. UC Santa 
Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal 
predicted that if different undergradu-
ate tuition rates were 
allowed, all UC campuses 
would quickly raise fees, 
not wanting to be left 
behind in reputation or 
money. This mad scram-
ble to the top would be 
counterproductive and 
in the end, hurt students 
as much as the UC cam-
puses themselves. The 
proposal also reduces the 
unity of the university 
system by taking power 
away from the regents, who currently 
serves as a system-wide governing 
board. Aside from setting the tuition 
range, the regents won’t have a hand 
in deciding fees. 

If the university institutes varied 
tuition based on application rate, 
a degree at UCLA or UC Berkeley 

— which receive roughly 51,000 and 
44,000 freshman and transfer applica-
tions a year, respectively — would cost 
more than one at UC Merced, which 
receives about 11,000 annual fresh-
men applications. This would exacer-
bate the already present fragmentation 

of the UC campuses 
(nobody is going to 
argue that Berkeley is 
on par with Merced). 
But by staggering 
tuition, the UC 
Regents are confirm-
ing that a lower-tier 
UC education is 
not worth the same 
amount as a flag-
ship school, which 
is like giving up on 
the lower-ranked 

schools before they have a chance to 
ascend. As the costs of undergradu-
ate attendance begin to vary at UC 
schools, some campuses like Riverside 
and Merced will further suffer in 
terms of their perceived reputation 
and academic quality. Ultimately, this 
situation could make it more difficult 

for the “lower-tier” universities to 
recruit high-quality faculty, staff and 
students, further dividing the UC sys-
tem. Blumenthal asserted that varying 
undergraduate tuition rates among 
schools would damage the concept of 
an interconnected university system. 
“I think it has been an enormous 
benefit to the state of California and 
the taxpayers of California to have a 
uniform tuition,” he said. 

To avoid some of the pitfalls that 
other universities have experienced, 
the UC Board of Regents ought to 
maintain full control over setting rates 
rather than delegating it to chancel-
lors, who will have trouble seeing the 
bigger picture of staggered tuition 
when working for the benefit of their 
individual university. The UC Regents 
would be able to make centralized 
decisions that aren’t just limited to 
setting a medium tuition price — 
thereby effectively clarifying future 
problems with this tuition proposal.

Though staggered tuition may 
eventually become necessary, the 
regents should strive for a unified 
campus system for as long as possible.

Dear Editor,
     As an undergraduate at UCLA 
during spring quarter of 2006, I was 
on my way to class via Bruin Walk 
when I first noticed a large event 
taking place in Ackerman Plaza. I 
smelled the food, heard the music 
and began to grow curious about 
what was going on. With the flags 
and attire donned by attendants 
increasingly visible, I realized 
it was an event celebrating the 
independence of Israel sponsored 
by Hillel at UCLA. Not far from 
the center of the dancing was a half 
circle composed of members of the 
Muslim Student Association. Some 
members were holding graphic signs 
depicting the carnage inflicted upon 
the Palestinian population. My initial 
excitement about the interesting 
event devolved into a sense of 
intense dejection as a member of 
a campus where mutual hatred 
was rampant and intolerance was 
inescapable.

 Presently, I am in a graduate pro-
gram at UCSD. Last week, I was in 
desperate need of a textbook which 
I worried may not be in stock. As I 
was racing to the bookstore with my 
mind cluttered by thoughts of poten-
tial alternatives on Amazon and an 
impending midterm, I noticed a 
group gathered behind a large Israeli 
flag facing the main walkway. As I 
grew closer, I saw that the walkway 
was lined by members of various 
organizations supporting the plights 
of Palestinian protesters in front of 
signs displaying images and facts 
about the occupation. Again, the 
pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian stu-
dent groups faced off — for all stu-
dents, faculty, staff and visitors to see 
— with no hope for discussion, but 
with the intent to divide. With police 
officers standing by nervously and 
passersby gazing confusedly at the 
commotion, I saw all I needed to see 
after a few moments. I proceeded to 
the bookstore with a distantly famil-
iar sense of sheer disappointment, 
then soon attempted to refocus on 
my book and midterm.

 I fear that the destructive envi-
ronment in which we are voicing our 
opinions will ill serve all students. In 
the cases I mentioned, if the ultimate 
goal of demonstrating is to achieve a 
viable solution that will benefit those 
affected by the Middle East conflict, 
then it should be clear that promot-
ing discourse is the only method of 
reaching accord among all relevant 
parties. The demonstrations in both 
cases only served to ingrain lasting 
memories of hopeless separation in 
the minds of participants and view-
ers. The members of the various 
groups would benefit from engaging 
their ideological counterparts in a 
forum that promotes tolerance, and 
most importantly, learning. The 
creation of immense tension only 
obfuscates truth and instills fear and 
misunderstanding.

 I ask that the members of our 
campus community recognize the 
vital roles student organizations play 
in our experiences. Accordingly, 
we must hold them accountable for 
ensuring that the way in which they 
operate on campus will reflect the 
type of educational environment we 
aspire to foster — a place where the 
examination of seemingly irrecon-
cilable ideas serves as the basis of 
learning. The failure to embrace our 
values as an institution of higher 
education will only result in the pro-
duction of societal participants who 
view divisiveness, hatred and intoler-
ance as norms. 

Years have passed between the 
two accounts I shared above, but 
little has changed. A new campus, a 
new time, same groups, same meth-
ods... same result.

Despite a revised state budget 
plan that includes $6.6 billion more 
revenue than previously expected, the 
University of California systemwide 
budget cuts for 2011-12 will remain 
at $500 million and could double if a 
proposed tax extension fails. 

According to a May 16 UC 
Student Association press release, 
Gov. Jerry Brown hopes to place tax 
extensions on the November ballot in 
order to close California’s remaining 
$10-billion deficit, down from the 
original $15 billion. With the revenue 
generated from tax extensions, the 
system-wide budget cuts would 
stay at the originally proposed $500 
million. 

But, according to UCSA Executive 
Director Matthew Haney, Brown does 
not currently have the Republican 
votes needed to propose the tax 
extension. If the tax extensions fail, 
the UC system cuts could double to 
$1 billion for the 2011-12 academic 
year, Vice President of External 
Affairs Samer Naji said.

“Republicans are holding up 
legislation to extend tax increases,” 
Naji said. “If voters extend taxes, 
the most that would be cut is $500 
million.”

Gov. Brown’s 2011-12 budget 
proposal includes a $1.4 billion 
overall cut to higher education which 
includes the UC, CSU and community 
college systems. According to a press 

release from UCSA representative 
Christine Byon, a $1-billion cut to 
the UC system could result in tuition 
fees as high as $20-$25,000. The UC 
Regents voted to raise tuition by 32 
percent for the 2009-10 academic 
year and by 8 percent for the 2010-
11 academic year. California resident 
undergraduate students currently pay 
$10,302 in educational and student 
services fees in addition to campus-
based fees. Cost of attendance at 
UCSD with both of these fees is 
$11,330.  

According to Byon, UC students 
plan to hold a budget “Day of Action” 
on Friday, May 20 to demand an end 
to higher education cuts and a vote to 
put tax extensions on the ballot. The 
United States Student Association 
organized a Day of Action for March 
2 of this year in response to the 
budget cuts. UCSD students did not 
take part in this, despite last year’s 
successful March 4 protest in which 
800 people marched. 

“Doubling the cut would reduce 
the state’s contribution to the 
university’s core funds —monies that 
pay professors and staff members, 
light the libraries, maintain the 
campuses and all the rest — to 
roughly $2 billion,” UC President 
Mark Yudof said in a May 16 press 
release.

According to Naji, the 
administration plans to deal with 
the budget cuts at UCSD by closing 
CLICS and other campus libraries.

University staff and students 

from the Student Worker Collective 
and the local chapter of American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees union met May 
12 on Library Walk and Hillcrest 
Medical Center to protest the budget 
cuts. According to senior custodian 
Jose Puga, about 200 people attended 
the protests.  

“Instead of cutting workers or 
increasing tuition, UC administrators’ 
benefits can be cut,” Puga said. “Their 
perks are very expensive, and all of 
us have to pay — both students and 
workers.”

According to Puga, taking $1,000 
off of UC administrators’ benefits 
could save $20 million annually.

Naji is working with Student-
Organized Public Affairs 
Committee head Arshya Sharifian 
to increase on-campus student voter 
registration and student presence in 
California’s elections.  

“Jerry Brown kicked off his 
campaign at UCSB, which has the 
highest percentage of registered 
voters,” Naji said. “If we registered 
40 percent of our students, he would 
listen.”

According to Naji, 38 percent 
of UCSB students are registered 
voters, compared to only 6 percent 
of UCSD students.

UCSD spokesperson Rex 
Graham could not be reached for 
comment.

I think I need to be emancipated from Mother Monster. Don’t get me wrong, I used to love Lady Gaga — I even 
paid money to see her in concert — but 
now the pop star is really starting to get 
on my nerves. 

It all started with “Born This Way.” 
When the Madonna rip-off and its sub-
sequently horrible alien-birth video were 
released last February, I heard grumblings 
from my friends (and the Internet) that 
Gaga was over. But in my optimism I 
thought, “The rest of the album couldn’t 
possibly be this bad.” However, now that 
Born This Way has leaked (its official 
release is next Monday, May 23), I’m 
beginning to doubt her even more.

For one, her antics are becoming tir-
ing as hell. No, being carried down a red 
carpet in an egg is not art, tweeting about 
how your “little monsters” make you cry 
does not sound sincere and, most impor-
tantly, Facebook gimmicks do not make 
your new album more interesting.

What’s this gimmick I speak of? In 
case you haven’t heard, Lady Gaga has 
teamed up with Zynga to promote Born 
This Way. The social-network game 
developer has introduced a Lady Gaga-
themed version of Farmville, appropri-
ately titled Gagaville. There, you can herd 
crystal sheep (seriously) while unlocking 
new tracks from the album. 

I’m not exactly sure how many Lady 
Gaga fans are avid Farmville players, 
but I guess now they will be swarming 
Facebook for a glimpse into the singer’s 
new music (even though you can just 
download the leak online already). It’s 
absurd, it’s pointless, it’s Gaga personified. 

Given all this hype, now that the 
album is finally here, it all feels anti-
climatic. There are certainly worse pop 
records (just give anything by Katy Perry 
a listen), but there are definitely bet-
ter (Britney Spears’ new album has way 
more hooks, and it’s less pretentious). 
Based upon my premature evaluation, 
every track (from “Dance In the Dark” 
wannabe “Marry the Night” to Catholic 
club-banger “Judas”) sounds like Gaga 
color-by-numbers: the self-referencing 
bridge goes here, the explosive chorus 
comes next and then finishes with some 
loud-as-hell synths. 

I’m starting to think Lady Gaga isn’t 
the pop savior we’ve been hoping for 
since Michael Jackson died. Watching 
“Glee” last night had me thinking that 
perhaps Gaga is a lot more like Rachel 
Berry, the musical-comedy’s cloying star. 
Rachel is talented, sure, but she’s also 
deeply imperfect: She’s intense and self-
obsessed, convinced that she is a born 
star, and eager to represent underdogs 
like herself (when her talent makes her 
far from a loser anyway) — a kind of 
Jesus complex that doesn’t always deserve 
praise.

Gaga is no different. There’s a large 
amount of vanity in the magnitude of 
her stardom that people don’t seem to 
recognize, and the only way she repre-
sents freaks is by telling them that she 
does (her outcast-proclaiming “Born This 
Way”). 

But who am I to judge? The Gaga gos-
pel works for billions of obsessed teens, 
eager to let their freak flag fly in the name 
of their idol. I just wish she’d care a bit 
more about the music than the spectacle 
of her image — meat dresses be damned.

Same Old Tide
The fourth installment of  the “Pirates” series 
gets stuck in cold water. By Neda Salamat

N ever has a “Pirates” movie been so aptly titled — “strange” is a fitting descrip-tion for the fourth part of the mega-
franchise.

After two sibling 
installments that 
largely resembled the 
drunken, incoher-
ent mutterings of the 
series’ much beloved 
pirate-hero, the movie 
— divested of two of 
its three protagonists 

(Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann), stripped 
of its three-time director (Gore Verbinski) 
and stacked with ample cleavage appearances 

by the sexed-up Penelope Cruz (Yo ho ho!) 
— has finally tacked down what’s eluded the 
series since its “Black Pearl” days: A plot (and 
boobs — sorry, Keira).

It’s a blissfully simplistic one, too — 
Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) et al 
race to reach the Fountain of Youth, with 
plenty of swashbuckling and booze along 
the way (Read: no mounds of crabs while 
Sparrow acid trips on some desert island). 

But what “On Stranger Tides” offers in 
the way of coherency unfortunately sacrifices 
in ingenuity — and while the plot remains 
linear, remnants of the confusion of previous

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2011 HIATUS

T he latest in the Woody Allen oeuvre of talky, lighthearted comedy, “Midnight In Paris,” swerves ever slightly from tradition: 
misanthropic writerly type — saddled down by 

a grating, better-looking 
female companion — 
takes to the big-city 
streets and grumbles 
at the sad state of his 
own rut. The formula’s 
admittedly worn thin in 
the decades since “Annie 
Hall”: there’s only so 

much room on the streets of Manhattan for 
another miserable, self-involved curmudgeon.

But in trading New York City for Paris, 
Allen endows the film with gorgeous, roman-
tic panoramas: of moonlit brick boulevards, 
Monet’s garden at Giverny, the Palace of 
Versailles. (Allen’s also noted in interviews that 
the move away from New York in his most 
recent films has mostly been an effort at cut-
ting costs). 

But more central to the film’s success is 
Allen’s choice of misanthropes. Owen Wilson, 
as Hollywood burnout Gil Bender, projects 
none of the smug self-absorption that so 
often sullies Allen’s protagonists. Gil comes to 
Paris on vacation with fiancée Inez (Rachel 
McAdams) and her parents, and also to work 
on his novel. The trio make for an amus-
ing, if one-dimensional, foil to Gil: Inez can’t 
fathom the appeal of the simpler life in Paris 
(Gil’s dream) when a beachside Malibu manse 

awaits; Kurt Fuller, as her father, deadpans a 
serious case for the Tea Party after Gil suggests 
they’re a band of “demented lunatics.”

To break free from the insufferableness of it 
all, Gil takes to walking the city streets alone by 
night. It’s on the first of these midnight strolls 
that Gil is ushered inside a vintage yellow 
Peugeot. He doesn’t make too much of the car’s 
appearance — a friend in L.A. has a collec-
tion — but by the time Gil is dropped off at the 
roaring, sequin-splattered nightclub where he 
spends the bulk of the evening, his suspicions 
have arisen: fedoras and ragtime aren’t quite 
the stuff of modern Paris nightlife, are they?

Gil makes the fast acquaintance of Zelda, a 
blonde bombshell of an Alabaman who intro-
duces him to her husband, F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
Once it’s accepted that the two are, yes, those 
Fitzgeralds, and that Gil’s been magically trans-
ported to the 1920s by way of French automo-
bile, the fun really begins. “Ernie” Hemingway 

refuses to read Gil’s novel, though offers his 
friend Gertrude Stein’s proofreading services; 
Pablo (Picasso, that is) suffers Gertrude’s wrath 
for the misogyny of his work; Salvador Dalí 
(played to harebrained perfection by Adrien 
Brody) makes a show-stealer of a cameo. 

When Gil begins to fall for the unearthly 
beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), lover of 
Pablo and student of Coco Chanel, things get 
a little messier. Adriana, too, yearns for life in 
an earlier time — and naturally, despite her flu-
ent English, fails to understand Gil’s claim that 
she’s an “art groupie” (probably for the best). 
It’s here that Allen’s message shines: that no 
matter how great one’s present, there exists a 
pervasive, inevitable nostalgia for a better time. 
That nostalgia, for many, extends to earlier 
Allen films — but with the joyful breeziness 
of this latest variation on a theme, the director 
may well be poised to entertain a golden age 
all his own.

O n every album since his 2005 debut, Infiniheart, Chad VanGaalen reinvented his prolific brand of art-rock, restlessly seeking 
new sounds and instruments to impart his sur-
real and soft-spoken melodies. His fourth full-
length album, Diaper Island, is no exception. With 
cranked amplifiers and a basement full of synths, 
VanGaalen has created his most raw and diverse 
record to date.

VanGaalen stamped out almost any trace of the 
plinking electronics employed on his ’08 eccentric 
folk rocker Soft Airplane. Opening track “Do Not 
Fear” immediately pours on the reverb-soaked 
guitar that drives most of the album. Songs like 
“Burning Photographs” and “Replace Me” feature 
VanGaalen at his most direct: dry, garage-leaning 
chaos bridled by stomping percussion.   

VanGaalen’s commanding croon also gets some 
serious playing time. The album’s standout ballad 
“Sara” swells with VanGaalen’s aching plea, “Sara, 
wake me up when you’re home!” His vocals carry a 
startling sense of urgency and passion when he has 
the courage to push them over the mix.

But Diaper Island isn’t devoid of VanGaalen’s 
penchant for the unconventional. “Can You Believe 
It!?” jaggedly shuffles along with distorted vocals 
and rambling, off-key guitar picking, before sud-
denly shifting gears and devolving into a grating 
peak of sheer noise. The album’s closer, unnerving-
ly titled “Shave My Pussy,” reads more like a freak-
ish postmodern short story than the bittersweet 
ukulele jam promised in its first few measures. The 
track brings disconcerting nakedness and harsh 
honesty to an uneasy boil as VanGaalen sings, 
“Baby will you love me? I’m feeling really ugly.”

Yet the raw self-indulgence manages to dazzle 
rather than bore, making Diaper Island another 
fascinating entry in Chad VanGaalen’s divisive 
oeuvre. It isn’t a mainstream breakthrough by any 
means, but VanGaalen shows that he can still keep 
his fans on their toes.

installments still remain.
Cruz’s Angelica is the same 

take-no-shit bad girl persona that 
Knightley’s Elizabeth Swann pio-
neered in the first three films (but 
now in Spanish!). But her character, 
save for her fierce devotion to her 
father and prowess with a sword, is 
vanilla, and her chemistry with Depp 
is equally painful to watch — the two 
exchange lines with an uninterested, 
monotonous tone as they parry ene-
mies with dead-catlike reflexes. The 
relationship, like most other aspects 
of the film, is sluggish and painfully 
formulaic.

Likewise, a “Twilight”-esque 
romance that blooms in the midst of 
the fray between a merwoman and a 
religious man is as dull as it is nause-
ating: The couple is hopelessly enam-
ored after only spending a few short 
hours in one another’s company.

Worse, an inexplicable guest-
cameo by Keith Richards as Sparrow’s 
father adds to the confusion, as he 
growls his lines with noncommittal 
apathy that’s become the trademark 
of the “Pirates” series, referring to his 
son by the cringe-worthy pet-name 
“Jackie.” And even Depp — undoubt-
edly the series’ biggest fan — seems 

bored, staggering through the movie’s 
endless two hours with the same 
drunken drawl that was, really, only 
refreshingly humorous the first time 
around. 

Perhaps the most confusing aspect 
of the film was the decision to release 
it in 3-D. Save the first few minutes 
where your eyes adjust to the glasses, 
the effect is no different than its 2-D 
counterpart, making it a total wash. 
The only reminder of the graphics 
teams’ efforts is the glasses imprint on 
your temples post-viewing.  

It seems the only one taking the 
franchise seriously anymore (and 
yes, that includes “Pirates” fans) is 
Geoffrey Rush. His unpredictability 
and enthusiasm as a character thrice-
reprieved are the only remnants of the 
Disney classic that almost was; even 
Depp is more vivacious and jaunty in 
the scenes they share.

But Rush’s invigorating presence 
isn’t powerful enough to forgive the 
errors and blatant laziness displayed 
by the rest of the cast and crew, and 
certainly not enough to forgive the 
archetypal plotline. “On Stranger 
Tides” has proved, (hopefully defini-
tively) that the “Pirates” series’ prem-
ise— like Richards’ weathered, crusty 
visage — is tired and out of date.

LA Beatmaker Hit Stride With Collaborations Only Rush Shines In “Pirates”

▶ PIRATES from page 7

as one of L.A.’s beat-making VIPs. 
His latest album Bespoke utilizes 
all the trans-genre tinkering of his 
past work — aided by a few of 
indie’s most engrossing voices — to 
produce danceable, sample-heavy 
grooves that are as exploratory as 
they are utterly beautiful.

Darlington recently spoke with 
the Guardian about his roots, his 
collaborations and his upcoming 
headlining performance at this year’s 
Warren Live festival. 

“I’m kind of a history buff,” 
Darlington said of his innumerable 
influences. “You might notice that 
my records reference moments in 
history and literature quite a bit. 
Also, some geographical locations 
inspire me. I find Wales to be very 
influential, the country of Brazil to 
be very influential.”

Though Darlington’s music often 
dwells in the familiar — intelligent 
beats punctuated by bubbly pop 
sensibilities — one gets the impres-
sion that he’s operating on a plane 
entirely separate from that of your 
typical flipped-bill, fist-pumping 
laptop jockey. This individuality can, 
in part, be attributed to Darlington’s 
jazz background.    

“I had fallen in love, primarily, 
with the music of jazz,” Darlington 
said. “But I was playing double bass 
and there aren’t many routes for a 
bass player. Unless you switch to 
electric, you’re either in a psycho-
billy band or you’re playing jazz. I 
do love the music... yet at the same 
time, it is a kind of museum piece. 
There isn’t that much being written 
for the medium that celebrates the 
old while taking it to the new. And 
that, for me, is the modern elec-
tronic scene.”

At that time, however, the now-
prosperous beat movement was still 
in utero.  

“In the late ’90s, the L.A. 

scene seemed really fragmented,” 
Darlington said. “There was this 
sense that drum and bass, or later on 
dubstep, was going to be the sound 
of the future. It was the sound they 
used in car commercials [laughs]. 
There just wasn’t much personality 
— it didn’t speak to people.”

But Darlington continued mak-
ing music in L.A., slowly becoming 
both participant in, 
and witness to, a for-
midable sea change in 
modern electronica. 
Finding a mecca in 
Low End Theory — 
an experimental hip 
hop and electronic 
nightclub in Lincoln 
Heights — Darlington 
and contemporaries 
such as The Glitch 
Mob and Flying Lotus 
gained underground 
eminence, testing 
the boundaries of an 
entirely new genre. 

“It’s one of those 
funny things — just 
life, in general, where 
you don’t pick a path, 
but the road rises to 
you,” Darlington said. “I started 
making music at the crossroads 
of hip-hop and electronic music, 
which is very fertile ground.”

Daedelus, like many beat musi-
cians, gained early notoriety from 
collaborations. In 2004, rapper/pro-
ducer Madlib sampled Darlington’s 
Invented track “Experience” in 
“Accordion” — the second track 
from the hugely acclaimed MF 
Doom and Madlib (aka Madvillain) 
release Madvillainy. Darlington was 
even featured in the music video.

“Madlib is one of the most cre-
ative gentlemen in Los Angeles, 
period,” Darlington said. “The way 
I got involved in Madvillain was 
just a twisting and turning — it had 

to do with music that was leaked, 
and beats that were made a long 
time ago by Madlib that sampled 
some of my work. I even got a 
chance to tour with them. I played 
accordion, actually. That tour was 
MF Doom, Madlib and Jay Dilla; 
it was incredible. Experiences like 
that, they change things. They 
change me.”

Yet Darlington is as 
much an individual as 
he is a man behind the 
curtain, embracing a 
range of earnest influ-
ences from Turkish 
psych and Saigon 
funk to his keystone 
Victoriana fashion 
sense. 

“But all of this stuff 
is just background 
noise,” Darlington 
said. “If people want 
to have the context, 
then it’s there, but if 
not, it’s just music. It’s 
not supposed to have 
everything spelled 
out.”

This year’s Warren 
Live finds Daedelus 

sharing a stage with fellow beat 
scene luminary Nosaj Thing — a 
seasoned lineup that will undoubt-
edly make for a memorable year-end 
show. 

“San Diego is certainly not 
outside the bounds of what the 
Southern California movement is, 
and the fact that we can all celebrate 
together is just an honor and a privi-
lege for me,” Darlington said. “I’m 
psyched to flip some wigs.”

And that’s a sentiment that puts 
the calculated pseudo-dorkiness of 
Muirstock headliners Hellogoodbye 
to absolute shame.

SPORTS THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

“It’s hard to play out there,” Kreutzkamp 
said. “Not only did we have a three-hour time 
difference, but it was an indoor pool. It’s just 
louder and harder to hear what I’m saying and 
what others are saying, so we had to adjust to 
that.”

For the first six minutes of the second quar-
ter, it seemed like the Tritons were going to fall 
back into the same routine: continuously play-
ing from behind and trying to catch up. Iona 
scored first, and when the Tritons got a reply, 
the Gaels scored again, further digging the 
Tritons into a hole. 

But to follow Lizotte’s outstanding first-half 
performance, the team picked up the slack and 
worked to outscore the Gaels in the third quar-
ter. Senior attacker Felicia Orozco scored with 
just over two minutes left in the quarter, giving 
the Tritons their first lead of the match. Senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell then scored with less 
than a minute left in the quarter to increase the 
lead and UCSD never looked back.

“We made some half-time adjustments,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “We didn’t see Iona all year 
long so we didn’t have a lot of book on them. We 
spent the first half getting a read on them and 
trying to figure out what to do, then we made 
some adjustments.”

UCSD found a groove at the start of the 
fourth quarter. Sparked by Crowell’s second 
consecutive goal, the Tritons held the Gaels 
scoreless for most of the final quarter and 
scored seven unanswered goals before finish-
ing the game out 15-9. Senior hole set Kirsten 
scored three goals in the second half to fuel the 
Tritons’ fourth quarter frenzy.

While the Tritons closed out the tourna-
ment with a win, they had a rough opening 
two games. On Saturday, they faced Indiana 
University, the tournament’s No. 6 ranked team. 
Bates and Lizotte scored two goals in the first 
quarter and the Triton defense shut out the 
Hoosiers to take a 2-0 lead after the first quar-
ter. However, the Hoosiers were prepared for 
the Tritons and responded in the second quar-
ter with three goals of their own. Bates scored 
with just over a minute left in the half after an 
ejection to take a 4-3 lead into the half.

“We know we can play with anybody in the 
top 10,” Kreutzkamp said. “As long as we don’t 

make mistakes we can play with these teams.”
But Indiana stormed back in the second 

half, taking their first lead of the game with two 
goals in the first minute. The teams traded goals 
for the rest of the quarter and the score settled 
at 7-6 in favor of Indiana. The Tritons scored 
two goals to kickstart the final stanza and take 
the lead, though the Hoosiers scored four unan-
swered goals, giving them an 11-8 lead to the 
end of the game.

“We came out like we meant to in this game,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “However, Indiana broke our 
press the rest of the game and we did not play 
the defense we needed to play for all four quar-
ters…we made some mental mistakes and we 
knew we needed to correct those.”

On Friday, the Tritons were paired against 
in-state rival and No. 2 ranked Cal. The Tritons 
own a series lead over the Golden Bears, but 
had lost the last time the teams faced each 
other. Cal started fast and strong, jumping to 
an 8-2 lead at halftime, while the Triton defense 
struggled to contain their opponent’s speed. 
UCSD could never muster much in the way of 
offense and scored sparingly throughout the 
game. The second half played out much like the 
first — with the Triton offense failing to catch 
a spark and the defense unable to contain the 
Bears. The Tritons fell to the final score of 13-5 
and were placed into the consolation bracket 
of the championship tournament after the first 
day. Cal ultimately placed second in the tourna-
ment.

“I’m proud of this team,” Kreutzkamp said. 
“There are so many distractions here, not to 
mention the pressure from a tournament like 
this. I was proud. They came out and stayed 
focused and played well against one of the best 
teams in the country. They just had more talent, 
but we played well.”

The Tritons end their season with their first 
WWPA championship since 2000 and a place 
in the NCAA tournament. Bates was a second 
team selection for the tournament.

“When you win it really builds your con-
fidence,” Kreutzkamp said, “The girls are on 
seventh heaven right now and really looking 
forward to next year.”

First Top 10 Finish Since 2007 for Tritons Tritons Set to Host Super Regionals on Friday
a great job as always and our defense was 
pretty solid.”

In an effort to push the game into extra 
innings, the Wildcats equalized in the sev-
enth. After an error from third baseman 
Woofter, Chico placed men on first and third, 
and Diana Payan singled to bring the runner 
on third home.

Tied 1-1, head coach Patti Gerckens 
called on senior Katrin Gabriel to pinch-hit 
for Esther Strom. Gabriel singled to left field 
and advanced to second off an illegal pitch. 
Chico pitcher Sam Baker walked the next two 
batters to load the bases. With one out and 
Sepulveda — who had already laid out four 
sacrifice bunts in the tournament — up to 
bat, Gerckens called for the suicide squeeze. 
Sepulveda dropped a bunt to Baker, allowing 
Gabriel — who is 12-for-16 on stolen bases 
this season – to slide in to home. 

“[Sepulveda] was seeing the ball really 
well this weekend and was able to put it down 
every time she was asked to, even when the 
corners were playing so far in,” De Fazio said.

With the win, the Tritons will head into 
the Super Regional round of the NCAA 
tournament, where they will face off against 
Cal State San Bernardino. As the top-ranked 
team in the region, UCSD will also be hosts 
of the Super Regional. No. 7 Cal State San 
Bernardino advanced to the Super Regional 

after winning their own sub-regional bracket 
with wins against No. 3 Sonoma State, No. 6 
Dixie State and defending national champion 
No. 2 Hawaii Pacific University. 

UCSD went 4-0 in conference play against 
Cal State San Bernardino — a squad that 
finished fifth in the conference standings and 
did not qualify for the CCAA tournament — 
this season, but De Fazio says the Tritons will 
still be training hard this week in preparation.

“We know that they are going to be a bet-
ter team then what we saw before, but we are 
definitely prepared to face them again,” De 
Fazio said. “We are going to be doing a lot 
of hitting in practice this week, since that is 
where we lacked this weekend.” 

But De Fazio remains confident after hav-
ing success against the Coyotes during the 
regular season.

“We need to score more than one or 
two runs a game, because we don’t want to 
put that much pressure on our pitching or 
defense,” the senior infielder said. “We hit 
[San Bernardino’s] pitchers really well earlier 
on this year, so we cannot wait to take them 
on again this weekend and dominate.”

The Tritons will host the best-of-three 
series on May 20-21, with the first game 
beginning on Friday at 4 p.m.

We Can Improve Ourselves Before Going D-I
beyond that, it needs to be the responsibility 
of our department to show everyone that we 
are ready.

This means creating a marketable athletic 
program but also a more marketable campus. 
We need to be able to make the name “UCSD” 
more of a commodity. This is being done 
academically with our rankings growing on 
the top colleges lists, but it also requires more 
coverage for events. First coverage to students 
should be expanded, such as games on Triton 
TV or locally. As we prove to ourselves that we 
are a big deal — even if we are actually more 

of a moderate deal — we will look bigger and 
better to others.

This is just a suggestion. It is up to you 
to decide if you want to make the move for 
Division I and where you want to place the 
burden for that move. I believe that corporate 
sponsors and wealthy alumni should take a 
more active role in funding this rather than the 
students. Let the administration know, let me 
know. What do you think and where do you 
want this athletic program to go?

with seventh place finish at the NCAA Championships.

Two weeks after one of the greatest upset wins in the program’s history, the UCSD women’s water polo team went on to the national 
championship tournament this past weekend and 
finished seventh overall, finishing their season in 
the top 10 for the first time since 2007.

“This feels great,” head coach Brad Kreutzkamp 
said. “I got here last year and this was our goal — to 
win this game.”

Despite the fact that six of the eight teams in the 
tournament were from California, the Tritons flew 

to Canham Natatorium in Ann Arbor, Michigan 
to play for the NCAA championship, where they 
came in seventh place after defeating Iona College 
on Sunday. 

The Tritons came out strong against the Gaels 
with freshman utility Sarah Lizotte scoring five 
first-half goals. However, Iona capitalized on oppor-
tunities and never trailed in the first half, although 
UCSD tied the game at 6-6 at halftime.

SOFTBALL — The UCSD softball team captured the West 
Region 1 title after defeating Chico State in another close 2-1 finish 
on Monday, May 16. The Tritons now have a perfect record in NCAA 
postseason play this season and will move on to the Super Regional 
— the furthest UCSD has advanced in the program’s history.

The Tritons put Chico 1-0 in the hole their first time up to bat. 
Leading off, senior Kris Lesovsky was walked and advanced off a sin-
gle from freshman Taylor Sepulveda. Senior Sarah Woofter followed 
up by loading the bases, reaching first on a fielder’s choice. With one 
out, senior Jennifer De Fazio hit a single into the infield. De Fazio 
was thrown out at first but it allowed Lesovsky enough time to reach 
home. The play earned De Fazio her fourth RBI in three games. 

From there, the bats cooled off, as the Tritons registered only two 
hits in the next five innings. But the Triton defense, anchored by 
pitcher Camile Gaito, kept the Wildcats scoreless until the seventh 
inning. Gaito (29-4) recorded eight strikeouts, while allowing only 
seven hits in the game.

“Our hitting wasn’t the strongest it has been this weekend,” 
infielder De Fazio said. “But we found other ways to score the runs 
that we needed to win. Our pitching was outstanding. Camile did

The Big West 
Said No, So 
Now What?
Word came in earlier this week that the Big West is not looking to expand its conference. For UCSD, 
this means the move to Division I athletics 
is unlikely in the foreseeable future, though 
there are still some options available to the 
Athletic Department that need your opinion 
and feedback.

If UCSD were to pursue Division I without 
a conference, our program would lack games 
in the season of each sport; our dominant 
athletic programs would flounder; in essence, 
we would be a school with no backing and no 

athletes. We would have so few programs at 
the Division I level that, logistically, it wouldn’t 
make any sense to make the transition. Plus, 
the NCAA probably wouldn’t allow it anyway: 
Under current protocols, potential Division I 
schools are supposed to obtain membership 
from a Division I conference before making 
the jump. 

What we can then hope for at UCSD is that 
we can get together with another school to 
crack the Big West open. If UCSD were added 
to the conference, the number of teams would 
be 11. But the problem with 11 schools is that 
one team in a week will have no games, creat-
ing a longer season that costs the conference 
more money. 

Virtually every sport at the NCAA level 
is in the red, save a few lucky basketball pro-
grams. So if we had another school with a 
large television audience to bring the Big West 
at least some commercial gains, we could have 
a shot. 

One such school would be Cal State 
Bakersfield, which is in Division I but floun-
dering as an independent program without a 
league. The best thing for us would be for them 
to get their program in order and bid with us 
for entrance into the Big West. The television 
audiences in San Diego and Bakersfield could 
potentially turn a profit for the conference and 
provide big incentive for them to let us join. 

But if that plan fails, UCSD can wait for 
someone to drop out of the Big West, though 
historically this is not a very regular occur-
rence. The Big West just added Hawaii as 
a member in December, and the Warriors 
provide a big market for the conference. The 
Big West seems content with their most recent 
catch, which has also moved them to an even 
number of member schools. In reality, it is 
more likely that Cal State Bakersfield will turn 
its program around. 

So knowing what needs to happen exter-
nally, what needs to happen here at home? 
How is this going to affect our program and 
how do we move forward?

The administration will probably keep us 
at Division II rather than commit suicide 
with independent Division I status without a 
conference. But we should get ready to make 
the move in order to show the NCAA and the 
Big West our willingness and ability to do so.

We need to prove we are ready within our 
own program — walk the walk and talk the 
talk of a Division I university even while stay-
ing Division II. 

There needs to be more funding for ath-
letics on every level. The 3.3 million-dollar 
increase suggested by the Division I feasibility 
report released in March needs to be reached 
for UCSD to touch Division I status in a hand-
ful of years, with three to five years of struggle 
to be expected before that. This needs to be 
done mainly through the athletic department 
raising funds from corporate sponsors.

I really think the main burden for our 
athletic program should be on the same shoul-
ders that the Division I expenses rest on: the 
department and alumni. As students, we have 
no money; we are already broke and eating 
Ramen noodles. We can probably afford to pay 
$20-50 more per quarter for athletic fees, but
