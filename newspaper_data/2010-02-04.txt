The fate of student shuttle and bus services 
is still uncertain, after the A.S. Council post-
poned a decision last night on whether to run 
the Transportation Referendum on the Spring 
Quarter election ballot. 

If placed on the ballot and passed by the stu-
dent body, the referendum would instate a fee of 
$25 per-undergraduate per-quarter to maintain 
UCSD’s free public-transportation services. 

In the absence of these funds, popular lines like 
the Nobel and Arriba shuttles — along with a hand-
ful of MTS routes — would be cut by 50 percent, 
according to UCSD Parking and Transportation 
Services Director Brian d’Autremont. 

The council’s vote to postpone the issue came 
in light of a resolution by the committee that draft-
ed the referendum: Committee members urged 
the council to reject the fee increase. 

According to Transfer Senator Adam Powers, 
a member of the committee, the reasoning behind 
the recommendation was that there simply isn’t 
sufficient need to pass the referendum. 

“It’s not that we disapprove of 
the language, it’s that we’re opposed 
to the need to run a referendum,” he 
said. “We did not feel it was proper 
for us to be placed with this burden 
without looking properly into alter-
native shuttle funding.” 

Many members of the A.S. 
Council — including Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy — said they believe the Parking and 
Transportation Department is using scare tactics 
to win student fees, and that there is little chance of 
public transit options being shut down.

“I don’t think the buses would actually ever 
stop running,” Kenworthy said. “I don’t think the 

chancellor would let that happen, because you 
can’t have a public university without a convenient 
means of going to campus.”

Kenworthy said he also believes the proposal 
is dangerous because it would set a precedent for 
A.S. Council to raise student fees to help fund any 
department in need. 

“Transportation is a department on campus, 
and this [would] be the first referendum that does 
not directly benefit students, and is outside the 
realm of student affairs,” he said. 

Powers agreed about the possible disadvan-
tages of passing such a referendum. 

“We’re worried that this could create something 
more — for example, Student Health Services is in 
the red as well,” he said. “We don’t want to take the 
shuttles hostage, but according to our research, 
there is more that can be done before the students 
need to reach into their pockets.”

In response to the council’s concerns, 
d’Autremont said that student referendums are

Google awarded three researchers 
from the UCSD computer science and 
engineering department a $100,000 
grant on Feb. 2 to fund their work in 
energy efficient computing.

Professors of computer science and 
engineering Tajana Rosing, Steven 
Swanson and Amin Vahdat have been 
working to find ways to reduce the 
amount of energy large computer 
systems use.

“Right now, if you look at servers, 
when you turn it on, it consumes a lot 
of energy,” Rosing said. “Whether you 
run a lot of programs on it or you run 
very little on it, it consumes nearly the 
same amount of energy. That’s kind 
of problematic if you’re trying to save 
money and the amount of electricity 
being used.”

In order to reduce the amount of 
energy being used by such computer 
setups, the team is working to design 
a system that will take in an amount 
of energy proportional to the amount 
required by the system.

“What we’re trying to do, effectively, 
is to create systems that will be much 
more proportional in terms of how 
much they run,” Rosing said. “The 
more they run, the more things they 
get done [and] the more energy they 
consume.”

The research is targeted toward 
systems such as the massive computers 
that run Google Search or Google 
Maps.

“In the long run, if we are successful, 
we will be able to show huge savings in 
terms of energy costs, and therefore 
by proxy in terms of reduction in 
greenhouse emissions,” Rosing said.

In previous research, the team 
has already found way to reduce the 
energy used by systems with respect 
to bandwidth, system cooling and 
memory.

Vahdat said they hope their 
findings in their field will contribute to 
sustainability efforts.

“Energy efficiency is important 
across a number of different industries,” 
Vahdat said. “It’s being recognized 
that information technology is an 
increasing consumer of energy. It’s 
an exciting time to be working in 
this space because you can have a 
real impact on the energy that’s being 
consumed.”

Of all the causes students may be asked to fund 
this election season, the Loft  — Price Center East’s 
arts and music venue — is no longer one of them. 
The A.S. Council voted not to place a $4.47 stu-

dent-fee increase on the Spring 
Quarter election ballot.

At first vote the referendum 
failed 16-10, then failed again 
14-10-1 at revote. 

The council initially voted 
during Week Three to approve a version of the 
Loft Referendum that instituted a fee of $3.82 
per quarter for all students. After the Graduate 
Student Association voted Jan. 25 not to approve 
the referendum, the council revised the draft to an 
alternate version that depended solely on under-

While on the hunt for the gene 
responsible for ciliopathies — diseases 
caused by cellular malfunctions in 
organelles that affect kidney, liver, or 
nerve functions — UCSD researchers 
instead discovered a cellular cause of 
early onset blindness.

This discovery could help in the 
diagnosis and treatment of children 
who would otherwise begin to lose 
their vision at an early age.

The search began in Fall 2004, 
when scientists were researching 
Joubert Syndrome — a ciliopathic 
brain disorder that affects children. 
The disease can cause mental retarda-
tion, a loss of balance, the growth of 
extra fingers or toes and, occasionally, 
retinal blindness. 

To study the causes behind Joubert 
Syndrome, scientists looked to a gene 
called “Abelson helper integration site-
1,” or AHI1, that had previously been 
linked to ciliopathies.

According to graduate student 
Carrie M. Louie, who led the research 

project, scientists began the study 
by removing AHI1 in mice to see if 
its absence would cause problems 
in brain development resem-
bling those caused by Joubert 
Syndrome.

“We try to link the 
genes in the body to their 
function, what they’re 
doing and what kind 
of diseases they can 
cause when the function is blocked,” 
Joseph Gleeson, associate professor of 
neuroscience and the project’s faculty 
supervisor, said.

Louie found that the mice did not 
have the same brain development 
problems present in those suffering 
from Joubert Syndrome. However, a 
closer examination showed that the 
mice were completely blind. 

Without AHI1, photoreceptors — 
also known as rods and cones — are 
obstructed by photopigments that 
build up to toxic levels in the eye and 
preventing normal vision.

After working with mice, the 
researchers wanted to see whether the 
absence of the gene was contribut-

ing to other diseases where blindness 
is a symptom.

“We generated a mouse model to 
study the gene functions and we dis-
covered that the mouse had severe 
blindness,” Louie said. “We studied 
this further, and we wanted to see 
whether [the absence of AHI1] 
causes blindness in human patients 
with diseases other than Joubert 
syndrome.”

They screened a group of 
European patients with cystic kidney 
disease — a ciliopathy that has prop-

erties similar to 
Joubert Syndrome 
— and found that 
those lacking 
AHI1 were more 
likely to go blind.

With this 
knowledge, new 

therapies and ways of 
screening early onset blindness are 
now possible.

This discovery will help develop 
of new drugs and improve tech-
niques for diagnosing retinal dis-
eases, which affect 5 to 10 percent of 
the population. Scientists will also 
be better equipped to tackle other 
ciliopathies, such as obesity, mental 
impairment, and liver fibrosis.

“We built the foundation for new 
leads to gene therapy,” Louie said. 
“It’s a step toward helping people fig-
ure out what your genes are doing.”

graduate funding. 
According to AVP Academic Affairs 

Jordan Taylor, the biggest change was 
that graduate students would pay gen-
eral-entrance fees for Loft events. 

Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
said both the initial rejection and the 
motion to reconsider was due to the 
lack of voting members at the meeting. 

“It’s midterms week, and not every-
one is here who was here before, and I 
want everyone to have a chance to vote 
on this issue,” she said. 

The Loft Referendum has met 
roadblocks before: It went before the 

council in the 2008-09 academic year, 
but was rejected. It was proposed 
again during Fall Quarter 2009, but 
postponed until Week Three.

The second referendum discussed 
concerned athletic facilities.

According to Don Chadwick, direc-
tor of sports facilities at UCSD, the ref-
erendum proposes to both renew the 
original $12 Canyonview fee — which 
is set to expire in 2013, —and increase 
it to $22 to account for inflation. He 
said the $1.3 million potentially gener-
ated by the fees would cover the $1.295 
million in operating costs.

Although there are three years until 

the fee expires, Chadwick said it was 
important to address the matter early. 

“We’d like to address it before it 
becomes critical, and before the situ-
ation becomes do-or-die,” he said. “If 
it fails we need time to take action and 
continue discussion.”

The council will discuss two other 
referendums next week: the volun-
tary fee to create a subsection of A.S. 
Council separate from the university, 
and a proposal to increase student fees 
to fund Price Center.

After two important referenda discussions, three impeach-ments on the table, and eight 
hours after the beginning of debate, 
the A.S. Council left the fourth floor 
forum in Price Center East at almost 
3 a.m. 

During the meeting’s public 
input session, Marshall Chair Tanvir 
Dhillon announced the new Marshall 
A.S. senator Junn 
Paulino, who 
was a member 
of council two 
years ago as AVP 
Diversity Affairs.

A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta said 
UC President Mark Yudof finally 
answered Gupta’s email regarding 
bringing the UC Regents meeting to 
UCSD “two months after the fact, but 
decided to refer me to someone else.”

VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez 
reminded council of the A.S. Meet and 
Greet free barbeque event on Library 
Walk next Friday as an opportunity for 
“you all to meet your constituents.”

Councilmembers hashed out 
details of specific language of the Loft 
and transportation referenda for eight 
hours.

UCAB Chair and AVP Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor presented coun-
cilmembers with the revised draft 
of the Loft referendum, which the 
Graduate Student Association rejected 
on Jan. 25. 

After a long discussion about the 
referendum language, councilmem-
bers failed the Loft referendum 16-10.

Taylor kept his cool, but asked 
that everyone who voted no on the 
language of the referendum speak 
to him immediately. After a break, 
Taylor asked the council to reconsider 
their votes, but was denied by Speaker 
James Lintern. 

A special presentation by Athletic 

Director Don Chadwick broke some 
of the tension in the room. Chadwick 
gave a history about the recreational 
facilities on campus, and the funds 
generated by them. Chadwick is pro-
posing a $22 student fee to maintain 
the facilities after the funds expire in 
2013.

A.S. members of the 
Transportation Committee and Brian 

d’Autremont, 
Director of 
Parking and 
Transportation 
gave presenta-
tions regarding 
the transportation 
referendum.

The issue of  MTS student bus 
stickers being subsidized, blue and 
white UCSD shuttles being eliminated 
and parking structures were debated.

The council finally agreed to table 
the motion until next week after 
another revision of the legislation to 
clear up language.

Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu brought back the resolu-
tion of councilmembers’ impeach-
ments. After a debate over whether 
the council can excuse retroactive 
absences, Biological Sciences senator 
John Erhardt was impeached from 
his position with a vote of 12-4. His 
impeachment will go before the A.S. 
Judicial Board, which will make the 
final decision. 

Sixth College Senator Kevin 
Nguyen’s resolution for impeach-
ment was tabled indefinitely and the 
Campus Affairs committee excused 
Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena.

Councilmembers next debated 
over whether to move the motion to 
reconsider the Loft referendum into 
New Business. After a 14-10-1 vote, 
the council did not move to recon-
sider the Loft in New Business and the 
resolution failed.

used to fund transportation at all uni-
versities with large transportation sys-
tems, such as UC Berkeley, 
UCLA, UC San Francisco  
and UC Irvine. 

Despite the arguments 
that other campuses pay fees 
for the transportation system, 
Powers said the committee 
believes other policy changes 
could bring in more revenue 
to fund transportation with-
out turning to student funds. 

“We don’t want to play 
chicken with the administra-
tion and we’re taking them 
at their word that they have 
no money, but we have brain-
stormed ways that more rev-
enue could be raised,” he said.

One proposal is to use a 
tiered parking-permit system 
to bring in more revenue. 

The committee suggests that the 
department reorganize parking per-
mits with a system that charges lots 
depending on how proximate they are 
to campus. For example, the Regents 
Road East Lot, which requires a shut-
tle to get to the university, would be a 

cheaper price than a parking pass for 
lots along Gilman Drive. 

Another proposal suggests that 
departmental shuttles — 
such as the Hillcrest and 
SIO shuttles — should be 
paid by the department, 
and that students using 
the shuttles pay money 
for bus passes instead of 
charging an overall stu-
dent fee.        

D’Autremont said that 
there were factual inaccu-
racies in the council’s res-
olution. He said that the 
university is already using 
a tiered system, in the case 
of Horton Hospital and 
Gilman Drive, and that 
while the tiered system 
could potentially bring in 
$50,000 in revenue, it is 
insufficient to bring in the 

$3 million necessary to maintain the 
current transportation system. 

The resolution also suggested a 
reallocation of registration fees to bring 
in more revenue, but d’Autremont said 
that his department has never received 
funding from registration fees, and 

instead receives money from Campus 
Affairs, the Housing and Dining 
Department and parking permits. 

D’Autremont also disagreed with 
the claim that the referendum is a 
last-minute attempt, and said that he 
has worked with three successive A.S. 
councils over the issue of budget, which 
he says is being stretched to the limit. 

In the past year, the department 
has moved from 52 to 40 buses while 
hauling an extra 2,000 people per day. 

“We have one of the finest univer-
sity public transportation systems in 
the world, but the money has to come 
from somewhere, and it won’t come 
from wishful thinking,” he said.

Although d’Autremont said that 
policy changes would create insuffi-
cient revenue, VP Finance & Resources 
Peter Benesch said the council’s sug-
gestion could bring in nearly the same 
amount of revenue without creating a 
student fee. 

Gupta will meet with Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox next Tuesday to dis-
cuss the referendum, and the council 
will vote on it next Wednesday.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2010. Views expressed herein represent the majority 

vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 

the members of the Guardian staff. It’s money-huntin’ season again — that time of the 
year when a handful 
of broke organizations 
try their best to throw 
themselves onto the A.S. 

Council’s 
election bal-
lot, in hopes 
the student 
body might 
vote to fund 
them come 
springtime. 

This year, in an attempt 
to subsidize shuttle ser-
vice costs, the Parking and 
Transportation Department 
asked A.S. Council to run a ref-
erendum on its Spring Quarter 
ballot that would require each 
student to pay a $25-per-quarter 
fee. Although A.S. Council put 
off its decision on the issue last 
night (what else is new?), the spe-
cial committee created to review 
the proposal recommended that 
Parking and Transportation look 
elsewhere for a bailout — a gutsy 
move that we didn’t seen coming.

Though councilmembers are 

definitely brave for 
standing up to the 
department — and 
dodging yet another 
fiscal demand from 
above — that doesn’t 
change the fact that we 
could potentially have 
a transportation crisis 
on our hands next year.

Parking and 
Transportation director 
Brian d’Autremont has 
been very upfront about 
the cuts he’ll have to make 
if the department can’t 
find a way to supplement its 
expenses.

In October of last year, he 
said that, if the referendum 
didn’t pass, he’d be forced to 
halve shuttle services — elimi-
nating Metropolitan Transit 
System Routes 3, 10, 150 and 
921, and reducing the frequency 
of the Nobel, Arriba, Mesa and 
Hillcrest shuttle routes.

He’s positive this is the last 
resort, and keeps reminding us that 
we’re the only UC campus whose 

Botox Can’t 
Fill the Black 
Hole That Is 
Your Life
My usual sail through the Interweb was halted yes-terday by a popup image 
whose grotesqueness rivaled that 
of any Freddy Krueger nightmare: 
Heidi Montag’s surgically altered 
face — pulled, pinched, pressed 
and pinned into place to produce a 
life-size celebrity Mattel doll look, 
available in a tanning salon near 
you. 

Did I mention her boobs are 
now DDD?

Okay, before I start bashing 
Montag for making her surgeon 
into a butcher, let’s review her short 
biography.

Montag grew up in Crested 
Butte, Col. (population: 1,500). 
She lived simply and peacefully 
amongst the mountain dwellers 
until transferring to San Francisco’s 
Academy of Art University. There, 
she met Lauren Conrad — other-
wise known as LC, from then-hit 
reality show “Laguna Beach” — 
who ultimately scored Montag a 
part on her scripted reality sequel 
“The Hills.”

Here’s where we stop and try 
to piece together the present-day 
trainwreck with the eager-eyed 
“Hills” newbie we saw enter the 
twisted celebrity funhouse five 
years ago. 

The shift from one phase of her 
life (frolicking between the igloos 
of Crested Butte) to the next (walk-
ing down Melrose trailed by a herd 
of paparazzi) is something that, to 
some degree, we’ve all experienced. 
A change of environment brings 
with it an inclination to reinvent 
oneself. Because, hey — if no one 
knows who we are, we can look and 
behave in a drastically different way 
without raising any eyebrows.

I remember coming to UCSD, 
just having surfaced from my 
frizzy-maned, headgear-heavy, “I 
let the water-polo guys cheat off 
me in Calculus” phase. Destined 
to be cooler than the old me, I 
tried (really hard) to look the part 
of the confident 18-year-old who 
hadn’t just gone on her first date 
six months prior, and who certainly 
hadn’t gone to every one of her 
high-school formals with a gay guy 
(though I always did have the pret-
tiest corsage of all — God’s way of 
throwing me a bone, I guess).

At my crossroads, I was willing 
to go to great lengths to rid myself 
of the self-consciousness that con-
sumed me in high school, and I’m 
sure on some level, Montag felt the 
same way. 

Not only was she entering a 
town far ritzier than Crested Butte, 
but she’d be filmed opposite LC, 
whose uncanny resemblance to 
Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller’s wife, 
duh) made her the emblem of the 
naturally flawless high-school prin-
cess we all loved to hate. 

If that had been me, I probably 
would’ve asked the show’s produc-
ers to cast me as the mysterious 
character who wears a mask for the 
duration of the series. That prob-
ably would have been less humiliat-

God knows we love the Loft. But we’re not ready for this kind of commitment.
Last year, one too many A.S. 

Council meetings dragged crank-
ily to 2 a.m., until the council 
finally voted against letting the Price 
Center music venue the Loft ask stu-
dents for $2.67 per quarter. (Or at 
least against putting it on the spring 
A.S. ballot. But that’s 
really the only ballot at 
UCSD famous enough 
to drag a mandatory 
20 percent of the stu-
dent body through a 
series of TritonLink 
checkmarks.)

This winter, after 
another few quar-
ters of camping and 
seesawing, it looked 
like councilmembers 
had finally agreed the 
Loft’s fate should go before students 
on their 2010 ballot. Last week, they 
approved legislation for a $4.47 Loft 
item on the spring ballot. However, 
when the graduate student govern-
ment decided it wasn’t on board at 
the last minute, A.S. councilmem-
bers apparently got cold feet.

Enemy lines were drawn at last 
night’s meeting. Fifteen Loft-lovers 

argued that students should be able 
to choose the (by now almost dou-
bled) $4.47-per-quarter fee — one 
that would ensure at least 80 percent 
of all events at the Loft be “pay as 
you can” for undergraduates — for 
themselves. However, 10 dissenters 
came out of the woodwork to shoot 
down AVP of Academic Affairs 
Jordan Taylor’s long-toiled legisla-

tion at the last minute.
As hard as it is to 

watch the Loft ref-
erendum burn after 
such a strung-out 
battle, our enthusiasm 
for the venue as a 
student-funded opera-
tion has faded. “Pay as 
you can” is awesome, 
but more line items on 
our eBills are not. The 
arts must stay alive 
during the economic 

squeeze, but no one should be obli-
gated to pay for them if they have 
no interest. 

Programming choices at the chic 
ArtPower venue are generally to be 
commended — we would go to see 
at least a few Loft artists a quarter 
even if they weren’t one staircase up 
from our afternoon cheesy tots — 
but the majority do tend to fall in 

the same vein of pretty indie-rock or 
“educational” snoozers.

The editorial board prides itself 
on being pretty involved cam-
pus citizens — and still, we don’t 
remember to stop by the Loft more 
than once a quarter. So when we 
do, we would feel better paying $10 
out of our own pockets (and vis-
ible budgets) than demanding $4.47 
from every last secluded engineering 
major on campus.

Not only do we already pay 
for the Loft in registration and 
University Centers fees — mislead-
ing for tuned-out students who will 
only see a new line on their bill 
labeled “Loft,” and think it a $5 steal 
— but we’re bound to feel too guilty 
not to throw a few bills in the pitiful 
“pay as you can” bucket as well.

It starts adding up, and not 
seeming so free-for-all, in a 
cliquish environment 
that only holds 235 
students a night (and 
often reaches max 
capacity).

The Loft was 
purposefully built 
on a model relying on 
noncontinued funds 
(aka, administrators 
expected students to fall 

in love with the space, then shell 
out when its cool factor was at risk). 
We’ve gotten an inside look into 
the kind of “emergency funds” and 
“donations” that seem to magically 
appear when students aren’t such 
pushovers; it’s the same reason we’ve 
taken a more conservative stance 
on the (much more expensive, and 
impacting) transportation referen-
dum.

It’s the right time for the A.S. 
Council to test University Centers’ 
bluff. Without our extra funds, 
the Loft won’t lose its space nor its 
sound system — so dance parties 
are still a possibility, as are org-
sponsored events. 

Plus, the Loft is gaining cred-
ibility around San Diego for being a 
groovy live spot. The university has 
already put so much into its beauti-
ful art baby that there’s no risk of 

it fading away completely —so 
let’s fight the fee, get in 

line and fund our fun 
the old-fashioned 

way.

OPINION� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

students don’t pay a transportation 
fee. But that point is moot when 
you consider that our intercollegiate 
activity fee is $118 per quarter, while 
Berkeley’s rough equivalent is $28 
per semester. Each campus has its 
own history of bailouts and buf-
fers. It’s not necessarily applicable 
to point a finger at other 
campuses and say, “but 
they’re doing it!”

So now, one of 
two things will hap-
pen: 1) Parking and 
Transportation Services 
will crawl up to some 
administrator’s doorstep 
with one helluva puppy-
dog face and guilt them 
into scrounging up some 
emergency funds, or 2) 
shuttle services will, in 
fact, be cut, and fitting onto over-
crowded shuttles next year will be a 
yearlong lesson in acro-yoga.

The council is right to think an 
administrative bailout is still a pos-
sibility, especially since encouraging 
sustainable transportation to cam-
pus is UCSD’s most crucial bullet 
point on its list of green bragging 
rights. And we all know how much 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox loves 
her green bragging rights.

Not to mention, if word gets out 
to prospective students that we’ve 
got a shitty public-transportation 
system, it might actually hurt 
UCSD’s allure. It’s a shame, really — 
just when the Loft was starting to 
redeem our infamous “socially dead” 
suffix.

Oh right, the Loft: There’s an 
example of a university-born busi-
ness that claimed it couldn’t go on 
without our help. Weird — it mirac-
ulously survived when A.S. Council 
refused to place it on the ballot last 

year. Guess Loft director Martin 
Wollensen has some extra-pitiful 
puppy eyes.

In recommending that A.S. 
Council reject the transportation 
referendum, the committee tasked 
with writing the document also sent 
along some suggestions they’d like 
to see enacted before Parking and 

Transportation asks it to 
reconsider. 

Though we appreciate 
many of the commit-
tee’s suggestions, they 
might not be enough 
to fill the financial gap 
d’Autremont’s deal-
ing with. He’s already 
shot down their idea 
of instituting tiered 
parking permits, argu-
ing that Parking and 
Transportation already 

(sort of) does that and, besides, it 
wouldn’t earn him enough to make 
a difference anyway.

As for asking for funding from 
registration fees, it’s probably a long 
shot, but we might as well try.  

However, A.S. Council’s recom-
mendation to cut all MTS lines 
before attacking UCSD shuttles is 
not only outrageous, but telling of 
the tiny University Towne Center 
bubble in which many councilmem-
bers live. Cutting off our outer-city 
lifelines will not only isolate us 
further from our surrounding com-
munity, but also eliminate a valuable 
service for all those who can’t afford 
to live on campus or in its expensive 
condo foregrounds.

In the end, we won’t know until 
next year if the university’s pride — 
or our own — will sabotage trans-
portation at UCSD, but it’s worth 
it to find out the hard way. In the 
meantime, d’Autremont better be 
practicing his pout.

ing than to be compared onscreen 
to Laguna Beach Barbie, sipping on 
a martini at Les Deux.

After constantly being com-
pared to a city’s worth of Sports 
Illustrated’s next bikini covers, it’s 
not surprising that Heidi decided to 
go under the knife. 

And it’s not just Heidi, or me. 
Girls everywhere try to exchange 
their freckled cuteness for some-
thing more glamorous. 

One girl from my freshman 
dorm arrived on the scene as a 
spectacled, self-proclaimed AP nerd 
with a cropped haircut and simple 
style. Naturally adorable, she waited 
exactly one quarter before throw-

ing on pounds of too-dark liquid 
foundation, instantly perfectly 
curled hair extensions and buying 
platform wedges. 

It’s reasonable that we want to 
try to shatter the tired “smart girls 
are ugly” stereotype (an especially 
prominent myth in Revelle), but 
at the same time, girls like my old 
suitemate and Montag have taken it 
way too far. 

By swathing themselves in sun-
kissed crap and swapping cardigans 
for navel ring-baring tube tops, 
both women look ten times more 
self-conscious than before.

With the extreme end of the 
spectrum now marked by Montag’s 
rock-hard face and watermelon 

boobs, we can all thank heaven 
that’s not us and learn from her 
checkstand humiliation that we’re 
better off as we are. Even the lesser 
“Clueless” makeover process should 
be kept in check: It doesn’t matter 
how thick your lips or glittery your 
eye makeup, if your personality 
sucks, you do too.

There’s nothing wrong with tak-
ing pride in your appearance; in 
fact, I’m sure the Kelsey of yester-
year would applaud the 2010 me for 
ditching the caveman eyebrows and 
opting for a more sleek hairdo. But 
if you wake up one morning and 
your dog doesn’t recognize you, 
consider the chance that you’ve 
taken self-betterment too far.

THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS

I f Lil Wayne’s new ode to American rock ‘n’ roll is a joke, I’m not laughing.
OK, maybe I’m laughing a little. 

Like when he “listens to his own voice 
in his black Rolls Royce” on “American 
Star.” (His gals of choice wear cutoffs 
and blouses; Wayne wears trousers. Aw 
yeah.) Or the part where he literally 

announces “Bridge!” before delving 
into said shit-rock staple. It’s a projectile 
vomit of an interlude, Wayne scream-
ing “Born and raised in the USA!” until 
his perma-croak goes so raw his eyes 
shoot slime. And the inhuman noises 
raping the guitar cavity can only be 
explained as Wayne himself gnawing at 
the strings with his diamond canines — 
apparently built more for glint.

I guess it’s just hard to laugh when, 
by all appearances, Wayne isn’t. Small 
moments of earnestness leave all illu-
sion of parody half-mast and awkward. 
This wiry little dude has always been 
downtrodden, but now he’s stretching 
into the caverns of an Axl Rose country 
heart, without a hint of signature wit or 
gravity bong to make it all a hilarious 
game. I mean, all I really wanna do is 
get crunk and do Creed impressions. 
But my main man sets his Auto Tune 
on heartfelt and quacks some shit like:

“The sun don’t shine forever, and 
everything that glitter ain’t gold.”

Or, “It feels like I’m runnin’, and life 
is the miles.”

No, really. What a fucking buzz kill. 
The only kind of depressed Weezy I 
care about is the one horning after girls 
who’re “down like the economy” and 
grinding out Martian fantasies on your 
granny’s bed-rocks. 

Wayne’s made a lot of questionable 
choices — the bindi tattoo, to begin — 
but Feb. 2’s Rebirth is a monster UFO-
sized cowpie to potentially outstink the 
lingering charms of all nerdy hiccups 
past. Ever wonder what Kid Rock would 
sound like with a mouthful of pokey 
grillpieces and Auto Tune on lock? Lust 
no longer, for the abominable white-
trash blackman has been unleashed.

Worst part is, now he’s stuck in jail

J ust in case “Valentine’s Day” doesn’t look cheesy enough, one of the film’s starlets has debuted a single to match its release. Yep, 
Taylor Swift’s “Today Was a Fairytale” is your 
latest Ben & Jerry binge song. As anyone well-
versed in Swift knows, she’s good at three things: 
dropping Grammys, handling Kanye and croon-
ing about unrequited love. “Fairytale” is no dif-
ferent from the pop melodies off 2008’s Fearless, 
except that it lacks the narrative that made “Love 
Story” a chart-topper. In place of plot, we get sac-
charine nothingness — “I wore a dress/ You wore 
a dark gray T-shirt/ You told me I was pretty 
when I looked like a mess” — and a lulling elec-
tric guitar to boot. Is it just me, or is this whole 
“White Horse” routine becoming white noise?

Hiatus Editor

A fter a five-year absence and being overtaken by obscurity (it’s hard to garner publicity when nobody sees a face behind the music), 
Gorillaz is back with “Stylo,” the first single leaked 
from Plastic Beach, their upcoming album due out 
March 9. The track revives the Gorillaz’ eclectic 
curiosity, delivering a dark synth-electro beat that 
meshes oddly well with distorted background 
choir. The lead voices, provided by the soulful 
Bobby Womack and ultra-cool Mos Def, lend a 
strange emotive power, bearing few similarities to 
the relaxed, freewheeling style evident on smash 
hit of yesteryear “Feel Good Inc.” While not a mas-
terpiece, “Stylo” deserves props for eschewing your 
typical hot-hit formula in pursuit of uncommon 
— if not quite stunning — combination.

— Imran Manji  
Senior Staff Writer

F orty years after Hendrix died, his estate is still releasing unfinished tracks like “Valleys of Neptune” — but without catchy hooks or 
trademark solos, “Valleys” doesn’t sound much 
like the rock god. The closest it gets to a famous 
guitar freakout is the intro: a schizoid, off-tempo 
instrumental breakdown that rolls right into the 
verse. Everything is muzzled behind the vocals, 
so it’s like a double-speed version of the melan-
choly “The Wind Cries Mary.” After a few listens, 
though, the track unlocks itself — the heavy, 
echoed guitar behind Hendrix’s forceful vocals 
gives the track a rambling energy. If you’re not 
too stubborn to let go of this guitar god’s glory 
tracks, “Valleys” will, at the very least, dust off 
your air-strument.

room. After she posted recordings on MySpace last year, 
Podington Bear — a side project of the Hush record 
label — noticed them on a news feed.

Lucky for Tsui, producer Chad Crouch liked her soft 
little jingles so much, he decided to help her out with 
some simple backup instrumentation. Thus, the five del-
icate tracks of Milk the Moon were born in August 2009. 

Tsui’s Internet personality is rounded out by a series 
of lifelike, yet slightly unexpected, nature sketches. On 
her blog, you can scroll past a moose with a pumpkin on 
its head, followed by a platypus balancing an apple on its 
snout. You might begin to notice a theme. 

“I really like animals in weird situations,” Tsui said. “I 
think it’s funny to draw them doing human things.” 

The cut-and-paste handiwork on the cover of Moon 
doesn’t betray her ultra-indie, cute-over-

load aesthetic. 
“I get inspired by the imagination and 

imagery in kids’ books,” Tsui said. In fact, 
she said she dreams of being a children’s-book 
illustrator one day. (So it comes as no surprise 
that her toddler-friendly stage name directly 
references Babar.)

One standout on Milk is the whimsical 
“Face First, Feet First,” which Tsui claims 

was inspired by a meteor shower that she 
watched with her family. In the clearest 

of sleep-voices she swoons, “Fireflies 
scatter as they milk the moon/ 

See NARROW, page 8

See TSUI, page 9

hristina Tsui could make even the 
most reluctant frat boy want to rip 
off his striped neon tank top, pull 
on some footie pajamas and do 
somersaults through Price Center. 

At first listen, it’s easy to mis-
take A Book About Elephants for 

the lullaby cassette your parents played 
over your bassinet — but Elephants is in 

fact the nostalgic brainchild of a certain Marshall 
College sophomore. And in case you took Tsui’s 
self-pigeonholing on MySpace to heart, the peace-
ful accoustics and unaffected vocals of EP Milk The 
Moon don’t actually sound like “whales fighting.” A 
more accurate comparison might be Iron & Wine, 
Tristan Prettyman or the Moldy Peaches, a la the 
“Juno” soundtrack. 

Drooled over as “bedroom recordings” 
on the blogosphere, her songs weave slow 
spells on the soft spots of intellectuals 
with a weakness for contemporary folk. 
Unsurprisingly, Tsui really does record 

her music from the comfort of her bed-

From Paris With Love
STARRING JOHN TRAVOLTA & JONATHAN RHYS 
MEYERS
DIRECTED BY PIERRE MOREL
RATED R
01:32

%\�1HGD�6DODPDW
Senior Staff Writer

Awash in dark, blue-grey lighting and set in a clas-sically romantic inter-
national city, “From Paris With 
Love” doesn’t exactly scream 
action-packed CIA film. However, 
in spite of itself, director Pierre 
Morel manages to give the flick a 
bit of original edge before it col-
lapses into a routine partners-in-
crime fighting flick we all know 
and tolerate.

James Reece (Jonathan Rhys 
Meyers) is a fresh-faced, newly 
engaged assistant to a U.S. ambas-
sador in France who is about to 
be assigned his first mission as 
a big-time CIA agent. Partnered 
with break-the-rules badass 
Charlie Wax (John Travolta), the 
two embark on what appears to 
be a run-of the-mill drug bust. 
The job quickly transforms into 
a mad dash to prevent a terrorist 
attack, with little explanation as 
to how the former mutated into 
the latter. 

Shaved bald enough to make 
Mr. Clean jealous, Wax struts 

around shooting just about any-
thing with a pulse. Tired of the 
rest of the world talking shit 
about the US? Wax busts hordes 
of Chinese, Middle Eastern, and 
even French drug dealers while 
peppering the action with one-
liner gems like “Wax on, Wax 
off !” Meanwhile, Reece lumbers 
along the sidelines, occasionally 
grumbling about having to drag 
around a vase full of coke like a 
pack mule, gun sitting forgotten 
in his holster. 

The film doesn’t task itself 
with explanations, but rather 
entangles itself in its own plot 
complications, tripping itself 
every time it changes from one 
Paris locale to another. Somehow 
the story falls back down the rab-
bit hole, reaching a semi-lucid cli-
max with the discovery of Reece’s 
fiance’s (Kasia Smutniak) inten-
tions to bomb the U.S. ambassa-
dor’s meeting. 

Of course, Reece gives that 
manipulative French temptress 
what she deserves: one gunshot to 
the face, loaded with bittersweet 
irony. 

Dashed with ill-placed, slow-

mo action sequences and less 
than impressive combat, “Love” 
certainly won’t have “Watchmen” 
shaking in its heavily inked boots. 
Even so, the thriller’s haphazardly 
timed deaths add a much-needed 
shock factor, poking fun at Wax’s 
Terminator-like efficiency, as 
Reece dodges a rain of bloody, 
mangled corpses issuing from the 
top of a stairwell. The chuckles 
keep coming, thanks to a well-
played performance by Travolta 
as woman-rider Wax and the she-
nanigans of desk-jockey Reece. 

“Love’s” excess of blood, 
explosions and hookers through-
out hint that writer Luc Besson 
has spent far too much time play-
ing Grand Theft Auto, resulting 
in a film sans creative dialogue, 
heaped with flashy explosions and 
plenty of gun smoke. Ultimately, 
it’s the actors and cinematography 
that pick up the slack. 

But never mind that; this is 
about violence, sex and kick-ass 
American good guys in Paris’ 
grimy streets. Even plot holes go 
down easier with a fistful of coke 
and a quart — or in this case, a 
liter of blood.

Ye Olde Radiohead in Renaissance times: that’s 
Midlake’s flute-driven 
shtick on The Courage of 
Others, its third album 
and most Faire-folky by 
far. Midlake’s production 
values have skyrock-
eted since the lo-fi psych 
pop of debut Bamnan 
and Slivercork, and now 
frontman Tim Smith 
and company don flow-
ing robes and give in to 
hippie pagan pageantry. 
Before they were praying 
to the gods of Flaming 
Lips and Sgt. Pepper, but 
now they’ve definitely got 
Jethro Tull’s serene folk in 
their reverent, yet morose 
guitar mantras.

And morose mantras 
are exactly how you’d 
classify Courage’s 11 
burn-outs, for they all 
feature arpeggio acoustic 
guitars layered en masse, 
Middle-Earthy flute jams 
and medieval minstrel 
harmonies. It’s hard not to 
feel inundated by woodsy 
vibes frolicking hereto and 
thereupon each and every 
track. 

Take opener and lead 
single “Acts of Man,” 
where Smith nobly pro-
claims “And when the 
acts of man/ Cause the 
ground to break open/ 
Oh, let me inside, let me 
inside, not to wait” like 
a prophecy on the altar. 
It’s a portent of what’s to 

come: 10 more tracks that 
cry wolf in the same mid-
tempo snooze zone. The 
LP’s procession is careful-
ly crafted, to be sure, but 
a few Neil Young-esque 
rock numbers thrown 
in the mix would’ve fit 
perfectly in this super-
serious throwback and 
corrected Courage’s 
finger-plucked slouch 
toward boredom.

As it stands, the best 
variation of its stoic folk 
mold is the title track, 
with a gorgeous flute and 
acoustic-chord pairing that 
ascends as Smith recites 
“He trembles alone” over 
and over with sputter-
ing electric guitars filling 
silence. Fleet Foxes made 
it look so easy.

for a year, and this closet log of glam-
fetish feces is all he left us to chew on.

Yes, Wayne singlehandedly revived 
modern hip-hop — by playing 
X-treme scrabble (sexy edition) all 
over it — but he also killed it, by mak-
ing everyone think all they had to do 
was fart out the first thing that came 
to mind, and catch it in a vocoder. 
But whether or not you like the cash-
jingling, “suck my clip,” fuck-you-and-
your-fine-ho-too schtick on which he’s 
founded new group Young Money, 
you’ve got to admit, shit’s catchy.

Rebirth, on the other hand, makes 
me feel terrible about all music, ever, 
ruined in one burp by my cherished 
Weez-bird here, kind of making me 
hate life in general — without even 
being able to go ape-shit on the 
living-room couch.

Though it’s hard to remember a 
time when the world wasn’t wrapped 
in Wayne’s dread tentacle, turns out 
it was only two years ago that Tha 
Carter III obliterated frat houses and 
Pitchfork (richdork) cubicles alike. 
Maybe this horrific new album is to 
prove that nothing — not even swal-
lowing a sloppy Joe whole and wiping 
the other end with the star-spangled 
banner — could de-throne Weezy at 
this point. But he should be careful: 
Jay-Z (on his game lately, if mostly 
still irrelevant) has declared the death 
of Auto-Tune with a sneer that smells 
of beef, and Eminem blasts Wayne 
in dragon’s breath on Rebirth’s only 
reprieve, “Drop the World.”

So, I guess I was about to say, 
“fall of Lil Wayne,” but — fuck no. It 
takes some agile balls to stoop this 
low. Damn if it isn’t killing me softly 
though.

FILMREVIEW

%\�$PDQGD�0DUWLQHN
Senior Staff Writer

Keep on sipping that poison, Romeo and Juliet, sink-ing with the Titanic, Jack 
and Rose and heading toward that 
white light, Noah and Allie — 
there’s a new “greatest love story 
of all time.” But this time they’re 
writing letters. Nicholas Sparks, 
the golden boy of emo-tastic 
romance novels, has struck again. 
And after his box office-exploding 
successes with novel-turned-films 
“The Notebook” and “A Walk to 
Remember,” you better hold on 
to that Kleenex because this one’s 
going to trigger water works. 

Set in a cliche Southern town, 
boy meets girl. They converse, flirt, 
look up at the moon and fall in 
love within the span of “two perfect 
weeks.” All cynical eye-rolls aside, 
this tale of young love is not nearly 
as nauseatingly cheesy as the trailer 
— complete with steamy make-out 
sessions in the rain and acoustic 
love ballads — would suggest.

Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) 
is spending spring break at her 
affluent parents’ beach house on 
the coast of South Carolina when 
she meets John (Channing Tatum), 
a bad boy turned reformed army 
soldier waiting to be deployed. The 
film wastes no time jumping right 
into their accelerated relationship, 
because as we know, after two 
weeks are up, they’ll be separated. 
Back to college, back to the war 
and back to reality.

Commenting not only on the 

difficulties of 
long-distance 
relationships, 
“Dear John” is 
also critical of 
the painfully lonely life of a soldier, 
living each day with the sole com-
fort of letters from loved ones. “ I 
think [the film] has a little more 
bite to it, and maybe just because 
the content matter is very relevant 
right now,” Channing Tatum said. 
“It’s about what’s happening right 
now, the 9/11 of it all.”

The acting is surprisingly well 
done, too. We go into the theater 

expect-
ing to see 
Tatum with 
the emo-
tional range 

of a gorilla (his trademark) and 
Seyfried bouncing around like a 
blonde ditz, but come out in awe 
of their ability to embody the gut-
wrenching emotions of their coun-
terparts. 

But chemistry is where “Dear 
John” falls short. For a couple that’s 
supposedly madly in love, we’re not 
buying it. They walk hand in hand, 
canoodle and make out, yet some-

thing still feels missing. 
We want to believe these char-

acters are truly in love. Take it 
from Rachel McAdams and Ryan 
Gosling, who dated after filming 
“The Notebook.” Those two had 
a full-fledged fire going, whereas 
Tatum and Seyfried are hopelessly 
rubbing sticks together. Maybe 
the fact that both actors have off-
screen honey buns pours water on 
the candle of love, but either way, 
the film suffers because of it. 

Luckily, Tatum spends enough 
of the film shirtless and surfing for 
us to care much.

Tomorrow, in a Year
The Knife
RABID RECORDS

F ollowing the experi-mental electro-pop of 2006’s Silent Shout, the 
Knife take a rather unusual 
approach with Tomorrow, 
in a Year: The Swedish duo 
write an opera.

That’s right, an opera. 
The freakiness doesn’t 

end there. Commissioned 
by Danish performance 
group Hotel Pro Forma in 
collaboration with Mt. Sims 
and Planningtorock, the 
electronic opera is based 
on Charles Darwin’s On the 
Origin of Species. The show 
premiered in Copenhagen in 
September, and now anyone 
can download Karin Dreijer-
Andersson and Olof Dreijer’s 
dramatic wails via the show’s 
website.

The unlikely kinship is 
as strange in practice as it 
is in theory. A combina-
tion of obscure, animalis-
tic images and electronic 
drones, Tomorrow, in a Year 
doesn’t really say much about 
Darwin; it uses his theories 
as a kind of structural foun-
dation. Simply put, the music 
evolves. 

The album begins in 
almost complete silence. 
“Intro” is laden with discon-

certing beeps and ambient 
noise that — with a bong 
rip or two — could almost 
be the soundtrack to the 
creation of the universe. 
The next eight tracks are in 
the same vein: confusing, 
noisy and slightly terrifying. 
It takes nearly 43 minutes 
before anything even resem-
bling a song takes form. 

At the start of the second 
disc, things start to look 
up, particularly with the 
11-minute opus, “Colouring 
Of Pigeons,” a song that 
could very well be the 
band’s crowning achieve-
ment. It begins with primal 
drums and operatic shriek-
ing, but soon gives way to 
Andersson’s melancholic 
cries. It sounds exactly like 
what you would expect of an 
opera by the Knife: a more 
theatrical version of the omi-
nous electronica for which it 
is so well known. 

But when it comes down 
to it, the album brings a 
whole new meaning to the 
word “inaccessible.” For 
every “Colouring of Pigeons” 
there is another 10 minutes 
of absolute nothingness.

Smoke and Mirrors
Lifehouse
GEFFEN

T he last time anyone cared about Lifehouse, they were playing at a high school 
prom, courtesy of a JC Penney 
contest. Apparently releas-
ing a couple of new albums 
was the next logical step for 
the Christian rock band from 
Malibu, Calif.

Judging from the genuine, 
though futile, effort Smoke and 
Mirrors — their first release in 
almost three years — one can’t 
help but want to pat the boys on 
the back just for trying. 

Lifehouse spends the dura-
tion of Mirrors mimicking 
Nickelback’s manufactured 
growling. Songs like lead single 
“Halfway Gone” copy a Kings 
of Leon vocal melody, but all 
attempts at mirroring a more 
popular band, make their music 
repetitive and meaningless. 
Even an appearance by Chris 
Daughtry on “Had Enough,” 
can’t save them; the songs are 
cut and dry, ready for radio — 
but good for little else. You’d 
never guess they spent over a 
year in the studio producing the 
record. 

Instead of slow-dance ready 
waltzes like “You and Me” and 
“Hanging by a Moment,” we get 
trite prose: “Cause I’m halfway 
gone and I’m on my way/ And 

I’m feeling, feelin’ feelin’ this 
way.” While the single plays 
over drum rhythms and call-
and-response vocals, apparently 
the band members weren’t fee-
lin’ much of anything when they 
wrote the tracks that follow. 

Anti-drunk-driving ballad 
“From Where You Are” starts 
out thoughtful with “I miss the 
years that were erased/ I miss 
the way the sunshine would 
light up your face” coated over 
a desolate piano melody, but 
never manages to pick up. The 
group attempts to unite rock 
balladry and spiritual beliefs, 
but the stale guitar and power 
chords never amp the songs 
enough, and after a while it 
feels like even lead singer Jason 
Wade has grown tired of singing 
his forlorn ballads.

The group plows through 
one mess after another, making 
the added synths and passionate 
vocals less convincing as time 
wears on. It’s hard to knock a 
group that tries so hard to seem 
meaningful, but 12 tracks that 
sound like alternate versions 
of each other — occasionally 
varied by some drum backbeats 
and a few pounding guitar 
chords — can’t save the album.

ALBUMREVIEWS

Piles of planets on the tip 
of my shoe/ I could count 
them forever/ Face first 
toward space together.”

Surprisingly thoughtful 
and cryptic lyrics, sung in 
a voice that’s cool as a glass 
of water, keep her songs 
from melting into lukewarm 
MySpace oblivion. 

“I try not to be too lit-
eral,” Tsui said. “I think it’s 
important for the listener to 
make stories, to try to figure 
the meaning out themselves.” 

Tsui said her secret song-
writing spot is the UCSD 
Food Co-Op, where she plays 

her guitar alone at night after 
she finishes working. 

“I’m an introvert when 
it comes to making music,” 
she said. 

But not when it comes to 
playing it. Tsui has played a 
couple of shows at the Che 
Cafe, and hopes to promote 
herself around San Diego next 
year  — once she gets a car. 

“For me, making music 
is more than a hobby. I want 
people to hear it.”

foil team,” Runyan said. “They need to 
learn from this experience, so they can 
reach their potential.” 

The men defeated University of 
Detroit, Cleveland State University, 
Wayne State University and the 
University of North Carolina — a win 
Runyan said he was pleasantly sur-
prised by. 

UCSD will be back in action on 
Feb. 6 against the California Institute 
of Technology and UC Irvine, after 
which they have only to prepare for 
conference championships.

“The goal is to get as many people 
as we can to nationals,” Runyan said. 
“We’re realistically hoping to get two to 
five fencers there.” 

Readers can contact Yvonne Chow at 
ychow@ucsd.edu.

“Alex Henley has been swimming 
amazingly all year, pulling out victo-
ries pretty much whenever we need 
them,” Cunningham said. “Right now 
it’s really exciting to watch her swim.”

Also on the women’s side, O’Brien 
won the 100-yard breaststroke with 
a time of 1:06.29, and senior cap-
tain Cunningham took the 200-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 2:22.64.

“It feels pretty good to win an 
event, even though we didn’t win 
overall,” Cunningham said. “I just had 
my motivations for my swim, and felt 
good to pull out ahead against a D-I 
school with D-I swimmers.”

On the men’s side, senior Daniel 
Perdew won multiple individual 
events, and also swam for the 400-yard 
freestyle relay team that came in first. 

Perdew won his prime event — the 
50-yard freestyle — with a lightning 
-quick flip off the wall, and finished at 
21.16 seconds. Following his freestyle 
performance, Perdew took the 100-
yard butterfly in 51.29.

More wins for the men’s team 
included senior Juan Pablo Carrillo 
in the 100-yard breaststroke (57.38), 
senior Todd Langland in the 100-yard 
freestyle (46.58) and freshman John 

Masehi-Lano in the 200-yard breast-
stroke (2:08.22). The men’s 400-yard 
freestyle relay team of Langland, fresh-
man Julius Espiritu, sophomore Blake 
Langland and Perdew closed out the 
meet with a win in 3:05.80.

Once the diving teams took to 
the board, senior Danielle Niculescu 
snagged first in the three-meter and 
second in the one-meter events for the 
women. Sophomore Bryan McGrory 
matched Niculescu for the men, and 
freshman Tyler Runsten grabbed third 
in the one-meter.  

In two weeks, the Tritons will now 
travel to Long Beach in two weeks 
for the Pacific Coast Swimming 
Conference championship meet. 

The Tritons will try to make the best 
of their strong season by qualifying as 
many swimmers as they can for the 
NCAA Division-II Championships, 
which take place from Mar. 10 to Mar.  
13 in Canton, Oh. 

“This is the last chance to qualify 
for nationals, so I think the whole team 
is going to be focused and swim hard,” 
Cunningham said. “We’re just going to 
be ready to move fast.”

Readers can contact Tyler Nelson at 
tcnelson@ucsd.edu.

block in the first set. The Tritons 
narrowed the 49ers’ lead to three, but 
LBSU expanded the margin to 21-15 
after another block — prompting the 
Tritons to call their second timeout.

Back on the court, the 49ers 
extended their lead to nine points 
before closing out the set 30-22.

“It was a rough night for everyone, 
in all phases of the game,” Ehrman 
said. “We couldn’t execute any part 
of the game well. They played a great 
match, and we couldn’t stop them 
from an offensive standpoint. We 
couldn’t pass well, and couldn’t get 
our offense going.”

The Tritons will get a shot a 

redemption on Friday, Feb. 5 when 
they rematch against No. 6 Cal State 
Long Beach at 7 p.m. in RIMAC 
Arena.

“From a team standpoint, this is 
the first time all season we’ve had a 
full week of practice before a match,” 
Ehrman said. “We’ve been hitting 
the gym, practicing passing, setting 
tempo, — and outside hitters have 
been taking big swings.”

After the rematch against 
LBSU, the Tritons will meet Hope 
International on Feb. 6 in Fullerton, 
Calif.

TRITONS
IN DAVIS

FENCING — Nationally acclaimed fencers from 
across the U.S. flew in to duel it out at a two-day 
event in Evanston, Ill. from Jan. 30 to 31. Hosted 
by Northwestern University at its Sports and 
Aquatic Center, the Northwestern Duals is one 
of the most competitive tournaments in which 
UCSD fencers participate.

The Duals was an opportunity for the Triton 
fencers to be exposed to the level of competition 
they expect to face at the regionals in March. 

There were three more women’s teams in the 
compeition than there were men’s, and therefore 
the women tallied more wins.

Men’s and women’s scores were combined to 
form a composite final score for the duel.  UCSD 
went 9-5 overall, with all five losses against 
national superstars Northwestern University, 
Ohio State University, Princeton University, 

University of Notre Dame and Duke University.
The women’s team chalked up a number of 

wins, helping the Tritons hold their own against  
fierce Division-I opponents like No. 7 Temple, 
the University of North Carolina and Stanford 
University.

“We credit the maturity of the women’s team, 
who have a lot of seniors and juniors who were 
able to perform under pressure,” assistant coach 
Josh Runyan said.

Each day featured eight rounds of duels, or 
five to six hours of fencing.

“The tournament was grueling,” Runyan said. 
“To fence this many fencers in this tournament 
is taxing.”

Despite the heavy workload, UCSD scored 
some notable victories.

On the men’s side, freshman foil Joseph 

Schenkel won three bouts, and sophomore foil 
Michael Fong added two against west-coast rival 
Stanford. 

Schenkel has had an outstanding season thus 
far, with strong tournament records and a third-
place finish in the 2009 Collegiate Open. 

Schenkel said that, in the tournament, there 
were some losses that should not have happened, 
but that the second day was still an improvement 
from the first.

“There was a lot of team bonding ... the team 
is really supportive of one another,” Schenkel said.

 Though unable to tally as many victories as 
the women last weekend, the men’s team is keep-
ing their hopes high for regionals. 

“We have a very talented, fairly young men’s

SWIMMING — While the majority 
of the campus’ attention was focused 
on the Jan. 30 Spirit Night basketball 
games, the UCSD swimming and div-
ing teams were fighting their own battle 
against UC Davis.

The meet signified the last official 
competition before conference cham-
pionships, and brings to close a stellar 
season for the Triton swimmers that saw 
the men go 5-3 and the women go 8-5 in 
all competitions.

Despite several stellar performances 
from individual athletes — the Tritons 
were overcome by their in-state oppo-
nents.

Both the men’s and women’s teams 
won seven of 16 events, falling by scores 
of 174-122 and 155-145, respectively.  

“It’s really hard to lose,” senior cap-
tain Carianne Cunningham said. “Our 
goal yesterday was definitely to come out 
on top, and it was extremely close. The 
fact that it was so close is pretty exciting. 
We’ve come a long way.”

The day began with the women’s 200-
yard medley relay. Junior captain Anju 
Shimura, sophomore Mercedes O’Brien, 
junior Jessica Ferguson and freshman 
Amber Tan fell to the Aggies by a mere 
second — a race that foreshadowed 
many close finishes to come.

Shortly following the relay event, 
freshman Beth Dong captured the 
Tritons’ first win with a dominating fin-
ish in the 1,000-yard freestyle, posting a 
time of 10:34.99.

Sophomore Alex Henley turned in 
the most comprehensive Triton perfor-
mance of the day: She turned in first 
-place finishes for the 200-yard free-
style (1:53.61), the 500-yard freestyle 
(5:06.59) and the 200-yard individual 
medley (2:05.69).

The women swept the podium in the 
500-yard freestyle with freshmen Megan 
Thomas and Olivia Martens following 
Henley in second and third, respectively.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — On Jan. 27, No. 
12-ranked UCSD men’s volleyball team 
opened its season at home, squaring off against 
Princeton University. The Tritons defeated the 
Tigers in straight sets 30-24, 30-24, 30-25 —
bumping their overall record to 3-5. 

UCSD hit at .518, setting a new school high 
for hitting percentage. Last season’s record — 
.469 — was set against George Mason University. 

The Tritons led 13-11 in the first set, before 
going on a 12-6 run to extend the to 25-17. 
UCSD claimed the first set when junior middle 
blocker Calvin Ross smashed over the final kill.

In the second set, UCSD grabbed the lead at 
11-9 after two Tiger errors. A subsequent kill by 
senior opposite Frank Fritsch and a Tiger error 
gave the Tritons a four-point lead; from there,  
Princeton never got closer than three, and 
UCSD closed the set with three straight points.

Junior setter Phil Bannan and senior setter 
Erik Sierks provided passes which freshman 
middle blocker Cyrus Kiani and Fritsch capital-
ized on for 12 and 11 kills, respectively. 

Bannan contributed 30 assists in two sets, 
over which the Tritons hit .565 and .577 respec-
tively. Sierks added 17 assists in the final set of 
the match, where UCSD hit at .441.

Junior outside hitter Will Ehrman — who 
added eight kills in the first two sets — said that 
despite the win and school record, the Triton 
performance left room for improvement.

“We won that game and were happy to come 
away with the result,” Ehrman said. “But we 
didn’t play very well in that match, and didn’t 
execute as well as we wanted to.”

Following its win against Princeton, UCSD 
traveled to Long Beach to face No. 8 Cal State 
Long Beach. The last time the two teams went 
head to head, the Tritons and 49ers battled to 
a four-set thriller in which three of four games 
were decided by two points.  

This time, though, UCSD fell to Cal State 
Long Beach in three sets, 30-22, 30-22, 30-21.

After putting on an offensive clinic against 
Princeton, the Tritons were restrained to a .045 
hitting percentage, while Cal State Long Beach 
hit at .387. The Tritons were out-blocked by 
LBSU 20 to three in the match. 

The loss left UCSD with a 1-4 record in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, while Long 
Beach State improved to 3-2 in conference play.
