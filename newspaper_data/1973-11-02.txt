McElroy And The Univers~ty Town Center 
by Hannah Cohen 

One of the major issues confronting both the 
university community and the La Jolla community is 
that of the lkliversityCommunity Town Center. On May 
9 the Chancellor and the Campus Planning Committee 
met and approved support for the Town Center con-
cept . 

However, according to ChanceliorMcElroy, the local 
press has misrepresented his position on the center. 
They have said that he supports the construction of the 
center unconditionally in the vic inity of the intersection 
of I..a Jolla Village Drive and Genesee Avenue. 

The memo sent by the Chancellor to the chairmen 
and members of the Planning Commission at the 
Community Concourse, San Diego on August 10, 
states that he will only support the master plan of the 
center and the entire center concept if the following 
conditions are satisfied. 

The ultimate size of the Town Center should be 
scaled to the population of the University Community. 

When the Town Center is first opened and at each 
successive stage, a balance of uses should be provided 
including commercial shops, civic, cultural and 
recreational facilities, housing and developed open 
spaces. 

In the initial increment of the Town Center there 
should be in addition to the major retail stores ; the 
following : 

A community meeting room with attached caterer's 
kitchen to seat approximately 200 people. 

An administrative office and recept ion area for a 
"Town Council. " 

A housing office with information on all available 
housing within the University Community . 

A City of San Diego branch library. Chancellor McElroy 

A theater or theaters to show films including foreign 
or art films . 

Temporary space for a leg itimate theater, the per-
manent facility to be included in a later space phase 
when the Town Center and the university commun ity 
have grown sufficiently to support such a theater. 

Spaces for a minimum of six stud io craft shops, 
where visitors can watch artisans at work and purchase 
their wares . 

A supervised and equipped day care center for 
children of preschool age. 

A var1ety of restaurants. 
Outdoor commun ity areas to include the following : 

a) An outdoor amph itheater in the central open space. 
b) Outdoor exh ibit areas for art , sculpture and com-
munity fairs . ) Landscaped plazas and gathering areas 
with sculpture or water displays. 

The Ice rink or assurance for its provision at an early 
phase in the development of the Town Center. 

Office facilities for research and the professionals. 
An increment for housing. 

An amusement center (with such faci lities as pinball 
machines, etc .) to provide entertainment for all age 
levels . 

Adequate space or right-of-way and a passenger 
terminal for a future personal rapid transit system . 

The scale of parking space should be reduced in 
proportion with the development of other forms of 
transportation . 

The City of San Diego should work with the 
developer in seeking funding through the program for 
Federal Revenue Sharing for Housing or other sub-
sidies to ensure an economic balance of housing 
with in the university community. 

For And Against Proposition One 
The most controversial issue on the Nov. 6 ballot is 

Governor Reagan's tax initiative, PropOSition 1. The 
general intent of the measure is to provide some sort of 
tax relief by restricting the taxation and expenditure 
powers of the state. 

Specifically, the measure would require the 
establishment of an expenditure limit (to be effective 
for the 1974-75 fiscal year) based on percentage of total 
California personal income. 

The Legislature could authorize expenditures over 
the specified amount to meet an emergency situation , 
to pay state debts, or to pay a tax refund from money 
which exceeds the established revenue limit . 

Starting in 1974 the ceiling on state personal income 
tax ratio would be 7V2% less than the rates in effect on 
January 1, 1973. To create a new state tax or change 
the rate of an existing state tax a two-thirds vote of the 
legislature would be required . 

The initiative would.,also place a limit on the taxing 
powers of local gO'lernment. It would prohibit local 
property taxation of a level higher than that which 
existed in the 1971-72 or 1972-73 fiscal year, (the higher 
of the two figures would determine the maximum) 
except in special circumstances. It would also specify 
that a local agency cannot Impose an Income tax 
unless given this power by a two-thirds vote of the 
legislature. 

According to Legislative Analyst Allan Post the 
initiative would require large reductions in state ex-
penditures. For the year 1974-75, a reduction of 
$620,000,000 is predicted; the reduction amounts 
would go up on succeeding years (over one and a third 
billion predicted for 19n-78). 

Post states that the required budget cuts would most 
probably be made in the following areas: (1) aid to 
local govemments. According to Post, this loss of aid 
would be compensated for by ImpOSition of new taxes, 
spending cuts, or increase In PrQperty tax (which is 
allowed in an emergency situation or Is hardships arise 
from special circumstances). (2) Senior citizens 
property tax assistance and renter tax relief might be 
endangered Since such cuts are permitted In the 
measure. (3) Aid to Universities and colleges might be 
cut. Because expenditure limits do not apply to tuition 
and fees, use of these sources of r8\/'8l"lue would be 
encouraged. 

Proponents of the measure point out a number of 
facts which they believe to be strong points of the 
measure. The most obvious of the84t Is the tax relief on 
both the local and state level which they feel the 
measure will proYide. According to Governor Reagan 
"The effect of the tax control program on the average 

CallfQ~1a family of four would amount to an ac-
cUmuiatdO saYing of $17,758.00 by the flecal yeer 

1900." 
Proponents also point out that the measure would 

k€:ep the budget level in accordance with the cost of 
living and economic growth levels. 

It is asserted also that the proposition would not 
cause damaging cutbacks in state programs having to 
do with safety, education, and environment. Neither, 
they say, will it cause a shift of taxes or costs onto the 
local property taxpayers. The measure does in fact 
state that property tax levels cannot exceed a specified 
limit, but there area number of exceptions contained in 
the proposal. These are : (1) in the case of an 
emergency situation , (2) when population or cost of 
living increases faster than the assessed valuation of 
property for tax purposes, (3) in the case of special 
circumstances creating hardship for local agencies, (4) 
when the federal government or court imposes new 
costs on the local agency, (5) when authorized by the 
voters of the local agency. The issue at this point 
seems to be whether these exceptions will be a 
significant factor in the application of the provisions in 
the propoSition. 

Opponents of the initiative assert that local taxes 
will be Increased to meet increased cost demands. 
This would take the form of sales and property taxes ; 
increased service charges would provide additional 
revenue. This raises the issue ' of whether Prop. 1 
provides for an equitable distribution of the burden of 
taxation . A study by CAL-PIRG states that "the real 
thrust of Prop. 1 would be a shift away from income 
taxes, which are progressive taxes, to property and 
sales taxes and fees, which are regressive means of 
obtaining revenue ... Economlc studies consistently 
show that these three revenue sources, just men-
tioned, take a much larger percentage of income from 
poor and middle income famll ies than they do from 
wealthy families." The issue here would seem to be to 
what extent such " regressive" taxation will be required . 

It is also claimed by opponents that the 7.5% In-
come tax cut favor the rich over the poor, since the 
7.5% reduction will save richer Individuals a larger 
percentage of their tax bill (e.g. someone who earns 
$10,000 will save .9% of tholr tax bill, while someone 
who earns flw times that much will save 6%). Those 
who favor Prop. 1 state that the 71h% cut Is applied 
equally to eYef'YOn8, therefore it Is equitable. 
qpponents also object that Proposition 1 would make 

It oifflcult to change tax loopholes and other Inequities 
by requiring a ~ vote to change a state tax rate. 

One of the most Important Issues connected with the 
proposal Is the question of which, If any, arMS will hp 
adversety affected by budget cutback~ ~,l Po<lt .,~­
predicted large reductions wtll occur If the me . lire iti 
puled. Governor Reagen has stated that Post 's 

calculations are erroneous. He maintains that the 
budget will actually increase in the next year due to an 
increase in personal income (the state income tax :" a 
percentage of total California personal income). 

According to the CAL-PIRG study preciously 
mentioned A. Alan Post has declared the fol!owing 
programs " l ikely to be cut" if Proposit ion 1 is passed : 
AREA REDUCTION IN MIGGIONS 

JUSTICE 
decrease police training programs 8 .9 

Senior Citizen Property Tax 
Assistance Program 18 

Renters Tax Relief 41 

Food and Agricul ture 
control and erad icat ion of pests 8 

Consumer Affairs 8 .6 

Gov't Regulat ion of Corporations 
and Banks 3.5 

Parks and Recreation 
Eliminate free or inexpensive 
status at many areas and instead 
attempt to make areas ~If supporting 9 

Education 
Halt new projects 122 
Eliminate state subsidies to libraries 

$200 tu ition at State Univ. & colleges 56 

$100 at community colleges 65 

End state schoJamhips and fellowships at 
private institutions 5.4 

Eliminate non credit courses at community 
colleges or di rectly charge for them 18 

The potential effect vI FIVV~IlIUIl I VII auucauon In 
California has been one of the central issues connect u 
with the tax initiative. The UC Student Lohhy claims 
that "the l!niverslty of California's budget is amcng 
those progrAm budgets most defenseless " to cutbacks 
If revenue shortages require cutback measures .. 

Supporters of Proposition 1 claim that no damaging 
cutbacks would be necessitated Since adequate 
funding for education would be prOYlded If the measure 
Is passed.

Halloween Folly 
It was really funny In Argo Hall last Wednesday. A 

girl got some glass In her eye when a water balloon 
broke her suite window. 

Everybody was laughing and really enjoying 
Halloween all over the Residence Halls. Or were they? 
The girl who got glass In her eye sure wasn't. 

Why must childish , horseplay like this continue 
every Halloween? Why must Innocent by standers get 
hurt before people come to their senses? 

Water balloons are not funny. Sure, out on an 
athletic field water balloons just get people wet. 

But when thrown in residence hall!> water balloons 
beCome a different matter. They are no longer just 
bundles of soft water. They become catalysts for 
damage and injury. 

Last year over $200 worth of damage was done. This 
year windows were broken and two innocent 
bystanders were cut with the flying glass. 

Why? 
"Boys will be boys" and "We have to let off steam" 

surely do not apply here. Someone who slips and falls 
on wet stairs will remember that " fun" night for days in 
the hospital or perhaps for the rest of their life. 

Maybe next year it will be different. Maybe next year 
the students in the residence halls will show some 
responsiblity . 

Maybe . . . Maybe people will be different. The 
Triton Times sure hopes so. We feel partly responsible 
the girl who was in] ured. '1 ne article on water f ights in 
the sports page was supposed to be light humor. But 
evidently the students in Argo and other dorms didn't 
take it that way. 

The Triton Times apologizes, but probably it all 
would have occured with or Wltnout the story. 

All that is certain is that Halloween at Revelle wasn't 
at all funny this year. 

Meetings For Revelle 
Freshmen 

During the evenings of 
NovembAr 4 and 5 Revelle 
freshmel'! wi ll have' a 
chance to meet informally 
with t , elr sumrnp.r 
orlentatiorl leaders. 

The or'entation leaders 
hope that at that time they 
can find au how the fresh· 
men are getting along so 
far th Is qaJ4rter. 

The leaders feel that 
such a meeting will also 
help them get an evaluation 
of the strengt hs " and 
weaknesses of the summer 
orientation program. 

Freshmen will have a 
chance to talk informally 
with Dr. Goodman , acting 
Provost of Revelle, Ernie 
Mort, College Dean of 

Revelle , Mary Dhooge, 
Assistant College Dean of 
Revelle , and Nancy 
Grooves , Academic 
Counselor at Revelle, and 
her staff . 

This is the flr~ time in 
Revelle's history that the 
summer orientation 
program Is being carried on 
during the regular school 
year. 

In order to accomodate 
the entire freshmen class, 
there will be two meetings. 
One at 7 p.m. on Sunday, 
November 4 , In the 
Humanities Library 
Auditorium, and another at 
7 p.m. on Monday , 
November 5, in USB 2722.

Yom Kippur 
Re- <:elebrated 

This Sunday has been declared a nationwide "Yom 
Kippur Sheinee" or "Second Day of Atonement" for 
American Jewry. Yom Kippur traditionally is 
celebrated only once a year according to the Jewish 
Calender. This year Yom Kippur began at sunset on 
Friday October 5 and ended at sunset the next day. 
This day is normally a time for Introspection, contrition 
and penitence, as Jews the world over spend the day In 
Synagogues fasting, praying and reflecting on their 
conduct during the past year. 

This year the sobriety of this most sacred holiday in 
the Jewish Year was shattered by the attack on the 
State of Israel by the combined forces of Egypt and 
Syria. While the usual solemnity of this holiday was 
simply upset In the United States upon reciept of the 
news, Yom Kipper for the Jews living In Israel was 
completely deprived of its sanctity as Citizens rushed 
to the defense of their country. 

This second Yom Kippur was scheduled so American 
Jewry could pause and reflect on the tense situation in 
the world today and in order to demonstrate solidarity 
with their Israeli brethren. An additional note of 
solemnity will be present , as this Sunday also marks 
the thirtieth day of the current conflict . In Judaism the 
thirtieth day ends the special period of mourning 
(" Shloshim") for the newly deceased. This Sunday 
special prayers will be offered for all of those killed in 
the war. 

All American Jews are being asked to fast from 
sunrise to noon th is Sunday and to donate the money 
they would have spend on these meals to the Israel 
Emergency Fund of the United Jewish Appeal. A table 
will be set up on Revelle Plaza this Monday to collect 
and forward these contributions. In addition, special 
services will be held by many Synagogues in the San 
Diego area. For more information please see the 
announcement section of this issue of the Triton 
Times. 

Protest Against 
UC Investments 

The Un iversity of 
California, Santa Barbara 
Student Lobby has an· 
nounced plans for a 
systemwide drive agai nst 
the Investment policies of 
the UC Regents . This 

comes in response to a 
declaration by the Regent's 
Committee on 
Reorganization that cor· 
porate policies on social 
and environmental issues 
are not to be considered in 
decisions on investment 
and stockholder voting . 

"This action represents a 
callous abrogation of all 
moral responsibility on the 
part of the University of 
California," said Michael 
Faber, director of the newly 
created People's Coal itlon 
for Investor Responsibility. 

" As long as the University 
continues to support 
racism , war profiteering 
and environmental abuse, 
students will be forced to 
conclude that their own 
Ideals and beliefs and 
those of the University are 
Irreconcilable. " 

" At a time when 
universities such as 
Harvard, Yale, Princeton 
and Stanford are taking 
positive steps toward 
investor responsibility," 
continued Faber, "the 
Regents of the University 
of California continue to 
dance to the tune of the 
dollar . Alternatives 
presented to the Regents 
called for an open decision· 

making process and asked 
only that the University 
consider quest i ons of 
social and environmental 
respon sibi lity . Regent 
Watkins and his 
colleagues, however, once 
again demonstrated to the 
citizens of California the 
dangers inherent in a 
system which places its 
trust in an elite few wealthy 
individuals. II 

"The UC Student Lobby 
had attempted to work with 
the Regents toward a 
mutually acceptable 
solution , · said Mike 
Clough , UCSB Student 
Lobby Co-director, "but 
this recent decision on the 

part of the Regents reflects 
our continued frustration in 
dealing with the University. 
This action is but one more 
example of the insensitivity 
faced by students, when 
they must deal with UC 
Regents." 

Clough and Faber intend 
to work together on a 
petition drive and publicity 
campaign to demonstrate 
student concern over the 
Investments Issue. Also 
under consideration, they 
noted, are plans for a ballot 
Initiative to have UC In· 
vestment Committee 
meetings opened to the 
public.

By Edward Simons 

I AM JOE'S ARM prr 
I occupy only one percent of Joe's total skin area, yet 

produce over thirteen percent of his fetid odor. 
Together with my cousin, Armpltt II, we coUld reduce 
Joe to a salt substitute In twelve hours should he stop 
his Intake of sodium chloride. Though he thinks we 
stink, our odor is our way of signaling him that he Is 
losing too much water and stuff. Placed right under 
the shoulder, between the upper arm and the rib cage, 
we provide Joe a very welcome service. We allow his 
upper arm to move. Without us, Joe would look silly. 
Very silly indeed. Sillier than he looks with that stupid 
moustache. If It's possible. I'll contact Joe's upper lip 
about this. 

The story of my evolution reads like Horatio Algeria. 
As you all know, Peking man's skull fragment has 
proved beyond all reasonable doubt that men's arms 
were fused to their sides. (This doesn't happen 
anymore.) Actually, the arm was connected by two 
flaps of skin that ran from my present location to the 
wrist , forming a rough tUbe. This tube was called the 
Weary Canal because (owing to the late development of 
extra· armpit sweat glands) all perspiration was 
channeled through It. Armed (get it?) with two such 
formidable weapons , man had few rivals in the 
primeval rat race. And people wonder why the 
dinosaurs became extinct. Hands, of course, were 
made to plug the openings and direct the'devastatlng

Epoch by epoch , other animals learned to avoid the 

malodorous man·oeast. Life became eaSier, and the 
men were free to u'se their time to pursue other, ah .... • 
pursuits. Chief among them was religion . Yet in order 
to pray, men's arms needed to be free. So nature 
decreed that the Weary Canal should retrogres~ to the 
vestigial pool It Is today . And they call it progress! Alii 
Alii can say is that it Motner Nature has any other hot 
ideas, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, too. 

As I've said before, we signal Joe's salt deficit. To 
do this, we mix Joe's salt with a secret blend of 
selected herbs and spices which we then excrete. WhY, 
Why, you ask, do we ' use salt to signal Joe's lac\( 01 
salt? Doesn't make sense, you say. Well, Mr. Know·it· 
all, if you're so smart, why are you reading this? 
Alright then . Anyway, I'll tum this disgusting diatribe 
over to the Chief Gtand's Brewmaster for the technical 
details. 

"Thanks, 'Pit. Okay, dupes, look at figure two. The 
big cylinder is the boiler and the little one above is the 
anti.deodorant holding tank. On the left Is the com· 
pressor, the little round tank. To the lett of that Is what 
we brewmasters call the modor. Anyway, salt·laden 
wastes are pumped Into the boiler and mixed there with 
the anti·deodorant. The resulting slime Is pumped to 
the surface through a crapillary and distributed to the 
outlets via the porlferous splat. That is the thing on 
top of the crapillary that looks like four·fifths of a

Halloween And College Degeneracy 

What's the problem 
around here wi th 
Halloween? Go to any 
neighborhood in San 
Diego, or La Jolla. or 
anywhere. and you find 
hordes of screaming little 
ones dashing from door to 
door. gleefully collecting 
goodies. but here. nothing. 
Oh . sure. we had trick-or-
treaters. but not the right 
kind. It might be so-and-
so, who sits next to you in 
Biology 678, or maybe the. 
let's face it, obnoxious 
offspring of the Bio 678 
professor. No real trick-or-
~re.aters . Real ones don't 
say "far out" when you give 
them something, or ask for 
beer instead of tootsie 
rolls. 

Yeah , I can see it: 
"All right, Junior, here's 

your mask and your Jello-
brand trick-or-treat bag . 
Stay out of the street. don't 
get too far ahead of Daddy, 
don't visit the Smiths (keep 
'em away from the Smiths, 
Harry), don't eat anything 
unti I Mommy can look at it, 
don't accept any apples or 
popcorn balls . and STAY 
AWAY FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY." 

Well , do you feel like a 
mad-brained rapist, or a 
botherer of little kids? Is 
there anything about you 
that could be considered 
mean Clnd evil by a La Jolla 
parent? So you're a little 
degenerate. But certainly 
nothing so god-awful that a 
little kid's mother won't let 
him come near you. 

And t,ink what good it 
would ( 10 us to have a 
chance t.:> pc just plain nice 
to somwne. It sometimes 
doesn ' t pay to be 
benevoltmt - it might get 
thrown right ~r.k at you 

the wrong way. But a 3'11 " 
costumed ball of anonmity 
would be the perfect 
recipient for all the good 
humor we've got stored up. 
It just says 'thank you' and 
runs away. And wouldn't 
that make you feel good? 

But instead: 
"Hey. George. Wanna 

get wonkered? We was all 
gonna go over to Betty 
Lou's and get wonkered. " 

"Uh . No, I guess not. 
Pete; I'm stili . recovering 
from getting wonkered the 
last 16 evenings. I think I'll 
just stick around here 
tonight." 

" Hey, suit yourself , 
there, George. I don't see 
what there is that's better 
to do than get wonkered . 
but suit yourself. there, 
George, hey." Pause. "Hey, 
what's this big basket of , 
lemme see, tootsie rolls , 
doin ' here by the door? 
Lemme have one, hey? 
Thanks. What 's they fOr, 
there?" 

"Oh , see, sometimes I 
get hungry after Bio 678, 
and I don't feel like walking 
all the way over to 
the fridge, so I just like to 
have something there, you 
know, to, you know." 

"Hey, there, you wasn 't 
hoping some of those little 
trick-or-treat bastards 
would come around here. 
was you , huh?" 

"NO! I mean , no, but 
what's wrong with trick-or-
treat bastards?" 

And what happens is that 
no one knocks on George's 
door, except a bunch of 
stone-crazies from Betty 
Lou's party, and all the 
good , warm, happiness he 
was ready to give to a gang 
of masked children is down 
the tube, because the La 

by John Taylor 

Jolla PTA has the National 
Guard patrolling the 
outskirts of the campus to 
keep all the little ones off. 
So George gets wonkered 
for the rest of the year, and 
quite possible wonkers 
himself riQht out of school. 

And why is that? Well , 
the parents who saw you at 
the drug store last week 
buying razor blades most 
likely thought you were 
going to put them in apples 
and give them to their 
children . " He certainly 
doesn't intend to use them 
on his face, for heaven's 
sake . Harry, look at the 
beard on that young man." 

So come on , everybody. 
Let's cut that hair, shave 
those beards and legs, and 
present a nice, wholesome 
image of Our School to La 
Jolla. And as you prepare 
for next Halloween, think 
not just of your, and 
George's, well-being, Think 
of the new vistas of trick-
or-treat ing that will open 
up for the children of the 
world . If this catches on, 
every University in the 
Known World will be 
swarming with little kids on 
October 31, ready to tap 
untouched stores of 
goodies. 

So clip this article, and 
sent it to a friend at 
Berkeley, or at Columbia. 
Spread the good word . 
We're gonna clean our-
selves up, and make the 
world of educat ion ac-
ceptable to the Parents of 
La Jolla, and of the world . 
Maybe this is what the 
Great Pumpkin's been 
waiting for .

Willie Brown, Chairman 
of the Assembly' Ways and 
Means Committee, spoke 
against Ronald Reagan's 
Tax Initiative, proposition 
One , last Thursday at 
UCSD , Although well 
publicized, the appearance 
by the San Francisco 
Democrat drew only about 
seventy people, seemingly 
indicative of widespread 
apathy (and perhaps 
confusion) regarding an 
election that the U.C. 
Student Lobby calls the 
most important in years" . 

Many opponents of 
Proposition One· have 
called it a " fraud" and a 
" hoax", but Assemblyman 
Brown called it "un-
necessary". According to 
Governor Reagan, the Tax 
Initiative will put a ceiling 
on the state budget and will 
reduce taxes . But , Brown 
pointed out that during 
Reagan's administration 
the state budget has nearly 
doubled (from $5.0 billion 
to $9.3 billion). State taxes 
have increased 17.1%in 
1967 and 21.7% in 1972, 
and the Govemor atready 
has veto power over the 
budget . Thus, Brown 
argued, Prop. one claims to 
do something that the 
Govemor could have done 
himself. And, if approved 
by the voters, it will be in 
the state constitution " long 
after Reagan is gone." 

Besides being un-
necessary, Brown claims 
that the propOSition will 
necessitate cuts in the 
state budget that will be 
"transfered to the local 
level , to local com-
munities. " The UniverSity 
of California's budget 
would be cut, so tuition 
would have to be raised 
just to maintain present 
programs. Tuition would be 
charged (for the first time) 
at California community 
colleges . In general , 
"people programs would be 
the first to go" or to be cut 
back, Brown predicted. 

The reason Prop. One is 
being offered to the voters 
in a special "off-year" 
election, Brown said , is 
that "Reagan knows that 
off-year elections attract 
far fewer voters" than 
regul scheduled 
elections. In other words, 
the strategy behind the 
special ~25 million election 
Is that "most people" won't 
vote. 

Brown also objected to 
the confusion caused by 
the wordi ng of the 
proposi t ion . " That 
document is already 
screwed up," he said , 
"there are already errors in 
it that need correction ." 

Finally, he advised , "For 
the people ... Vote No on 
Proposition One."

HOLES IN SPACE 

COSMOLOGY 
COURSE 

Modern theories about space-time and the universe 
will be explained in a non-technical way In a for-
thcoming UCSD Extension course to be taught by Dr. 
William J. Kaufmann, director of the Griffith Ob-
servatory. 

"Relativity and Cosmology" is scheduled to meet 
five Monday evenings beginning Nov. 12. Its subtitle is 
" Black Holes, White Holes and Wormholes in Space. " 

The meeting place has been changed from UCSD to 
the Casa del Prado Auditorium, Balboa Park, to ac-
commodate the large number of people expected . 

Kaufmann Is a young astrophysicist whose fame as a 
scientist able to clearly communicate involved con-
cepts about the universe has grown since publication 
of 111s recent book, also titled Relativity and 
Cosmology. More than 1,200 people enrolled in the 
same course at UCLA Extension earlier this fall. 

Cosmology is the study of the structure and 
evolution of the universe. According to Dr. Einstein's 
general theory of relativity , says Kaufmann , all the 
matter in the universe should cause space and time to 
become "warped." 

" As a result," Kaufmann says, "one of the most 
interesting questions in cosmology today is : what is 
the shape and geometry of the un iverse?"

between different universes. Here trip A is a "normal" 
trip within our own universe, trip B Is a catastrophic 
blunder into the infinite gravitational pressures of the 
Singularity, and trip C Is a successful tranSition from 
our universe into another. Trip D Is not allowed 
because it would require faster-t I-light travel. From 
Dr. Kaufmann's book.

such as that left by ·a dead massive star, the final resu lt is always essentially the same. 
Only the mass, electric charge, and momentum carried with the object are retained. If 
the entire un iverse goes down its own black hole, then even these fundamental 
quantities may be lost. From the book " Relativity and Cosmology" by Dr. William

At his first lecture Kaufmann will talk about the birth 
of relativity theory , and proceed on, in the second 
lecture, to the meaning of warped space-time. 

A passage from his book has this to say about 
"warped space-time" in reference to a collapsing star : 

" Because, according to general relativity , gravity 
is the curving of space-time, space around the star 
is severe Iy warp ad . 

As stellar collapse contin ues to its ineVItable end , 
th is wap ing becomes so great that space-tim e fold s 
in over itself and the star disappears from our 
universe! What is left is called a black hole ." 

Kaufmann does not assume students will come to the 
course with a prior understanding of astronomy, 
space-time or Einstein's field equations. Instead, he 
plans to "develop ideas from the ground up." 

TopiCS will also include stellar evolution, white 
dwarfs, pulsars, properties of black holes and white 
holes, galaxies, quasars and latest thinking on the fate 
of the universe. 

His book includes diagrams useful in thinking about 
very recent theories from the astronomy-phys i~S­
mathematics community. Kruskal diagrams, which will 

Campus, La Jolla 92037. 

also be shown in the course, demonstrate that black 
holes (if they exist as SCientists conceive of them) may 
connect many universes. 

The "other universes" concept implies " time 
reversals," or white holes in which matter and energy 
might possibly "gush up from some distant un iverse 
into our universe. " 

It is hoped that quasars, presently being studied 
with great interest by the scientific community 
because traditional theory cannot account for the huge 
amounts of energy they emit , will soon yield some of 
the missing link information in our scheme of 
knowledge. If so, in the future man may come closer to 
understanding " the" universe, and thus himself. 

But this understanding process could be 
problematic due to a 'which came first , chicken-egg' 
effect , according to Kaufmann , who points out that our 
psychological-cultural orientation itself is affecting our 
concepts. He concludes his book with these 
thouQhts: "The general approach of all of modern 
physll..di science is entirely mechanistic. It is 
mechanistic not in the crude sense of gears, levers, 
and pulleys , but rather in terms of trying to reduce al l 
reality to concrete physical laws wherein the only truly 
important quantit ies are those that we can measure 
with machines such as spectrographs, galvanometers, 
and photograph iC film. Ancient man thought of the

Saturday Flicks 
By Pellll)' RobertII 

Monsieur Verdoux presents a vehicle 
for one of Charles Chaplin's classic 
performances. Considered as one of the 
great Chaplin filrns, it explores, in 
engrossingly wry fashion the paradox of 
the privileges and evils afforded "big 
business" that are denied the individual. 
In this case, the business is murder. 

The theme is sobering and the comedy 
sardonic as Mr. Chaplin, alias Monsieur 
Verdoux, ex-bank clerk and bigamist non-
pareil , murders his multiple wives In order 
to get money to support his crippled wife 
and small child. The idea, of course, is 
appallingly and hilariously illustrated: 
munitions manufacturers and 

professional soldiers reap hon,or and 
and financial benefit from murder on a 
massive scale, while the Individual who 
murders regardless of his circumstance Is 
treated as a criminal. 

The question at issue Is not a strictly 
moral one. Nonetheless it presents a 
serious, albeit at times naive, argument 
that warrants consideration within the 
context of this maybe not so absurdly 
funny film. 

Playing with Monsieur Verdoux is His 
Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant, Rosalind 
Russell , and Ralph Bellamy. The films 
start at 8:00 p.m., room 2722, USB. 

Records Music All-Stars Kenneth MosS 
ERIC CLAPTON'S RAINBOW CON· 

CERT (RSO records - SO 877 0598) is a 
prime example of artistry which grows on 
you in a way that only after the third or 
fourth listening can you feel the fuli 
impact of the fine musicianship and 
musical production. The lineup is in-
credible : Ronnie Wood and Peter 
Townshend on guitars and vocals backing 
up Clapton, Rick Grech on bass, Jim 
Capaldi and Jimmy Karstein on dnu~s , 
Rechop on percussion, and Steve Wln-
wood on organ and vocals. 

When I first caught air of the per-
formance in the news earlier this year and 
when the album came out, I though to 
myself, "How can I go wrong?" Well, 
when I finally heard it with my friend, all I 
could muster up was a furtive yawn and a 
polite smile which meant something like, 
"My! This certainly is a pleasant little 
tune, now, about that Joe Walsh record 
you wanted · me to hear ... " I was ex-
pecting wicked, whining, sweet notes 
leaping out, knocking you right off your 
chair, but instead I smashed headlong 
into a wall of sound, a heavier Clapton 
sound accompanied by a full barrage of 
guitars. Upon closer examination of the 
album, I could have kicked myself for 
dismiSSing it so lightly the first time: 

BADGE is an adequate, but not superb, 
beginning, Clapton's vocal peaks nicely 
amidst the havoc, There's a fine solo, of 
course, and full complementary guitars 
backing up. 

ROLL IT OVER is "the one you might 
have heardon the radio ..... It's (j catchy 
pseudo-rhythm-and-blues- :ClaptonS:style 
rocker with (;hord rhythm baCK up 

which is tremendouSlPunctuated by 
well-placed harmony lead !attacks. It 
has a very acceptable solo for a song 
that can stand on its own I without one. 

SENCE OF THE LORD is a much better 
version than with "Derek and the 
Dominoes" (live) with some flashy wah-
wah guitar by Ronnie Wood as an intro to 
Clapton's usual all-systems-go solo on 
what is easily the best cut on the album. 
PEARLY QUEEN has a fine Winwood 
vocal, but nothing much else can be said 
about this tune as it has been played 
almost ad nauseum by everyone and his 
mother. The triple guitar harmony fills It 
out between fine guitar breaks by 
Clapton. AFTER MIDNIGHT is a slower 
version with great solos by Clapton and 
Wood (interesting to hear him in a non-
"Faces" vein of solo). Townshend is 
always there; he is just about the best 
rhythm guitarist in the field today . LITTLE 
WING is a fitting end to the album; It 
brings out the full harmonic advantage to 
three guitars. Each compliments the other 
perfectly, like a Hendrix dream sequence. 

In the end, then, Eric Clapton triumphs 
by putting this album over on me. He 
succeeds at one of the most difficult 
aspects of modern music: using in-
novative methods to keep the old stan-
dards still palatable . I still can't get over 
the lineup on the album ; that's always 
been my dream, something like the all-
star game in baseball with Ernie Banks on 
first and Eric Clapton on lead guitar. Now, 
there are some rumors going around that 
Clapton will be touring early next year and 
I understand Jack Bruce doesn't have 
many commitments these days, ...

VOTE NO 
ON ONE 

The Reagan Tax Limitation Initiative comes up for a 
vote next Tuesday (October 6). The Triton Times urges 
you to GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE ,NO ON 
PROPOSITION ONE! this measure would Increase 
your tuition, cut back on many import~nt state ser-
vices and increase local and regressive sales ~d prop~rty taxes. It rips off the poor to gi~e to t~e rich. 
For a detailed ana.lysis, see the following article by 
CALPIRG. 

CALPIRG Studies 
PrQPosition I 

CALPIRG considers Proposition I, which will, appear 
on State wide ballots this Nov. 6th, to be agaln~t. the 
public interest. Before explain ing our ~sltlOn , 
however, it is necessary to describ~ the inte~tlons of 
Prop. One. It seeks to limit the state s expenditures ~y 
tying state revenue to a set perc~ntag~, of ~he state ~ 
personal income. A I ittle over 7% IS the ~eslred goal : 
Below is the complicated formula by which all of thiS 
would happen. 

1974-75 State Revenue 73-74 
Expenditure = State Personal Income 

Limitation for 1973 
.001 

X State Personal Income '74 

In years thereafter, the expenditure limitation of the 
previous year would be substituted into the numerator 
of the above equation. For example, the following 
equation shows the expenditure limitation for 1975-76. 

1974-75 Expenditure State Personal 
Limitation - .001 X Income '75 
State Personal Income 

1974 
= 1975-76 Expenditure Limitation 

If you feel that this is complicated, you're correct. In 
fact one of the major flaws of Prop. 1 is that even 
before It is subjected to a vote in November, it has 
generated tremendous legal questions as to what 
constitutes State Revenue. Thus, it appear~ thB;t one 
crucial aspect of the equation can not be PinPOinted. 
This alone seems to be grounds for rejecting Prop. 1 at 
the polls.

Nevertheless, let us analyze other aspects of the 
larger Issue. Most any economist will state that taxes 
accomplish three functions: they redistribute Income, 
they pay for govemment services rer.1ered and they 
serve as a prim fiscal tool In managing the economy of 
an area. Prop. 1 would have a detrimental effect on all 
three of these functions from the point of view of all 
but the wealthiest groups and individuals in California, 
For the purposes of brevity, let us cast our attention 
only on the first two mentioned functions of taxation . 
The proponents of Prop. 1 call thenlselves the 

"Committee for Lower Taxes ," I ask, "lower taXtfS for 
whom?" The real thrust of Prop. 1 would be a shift 
away from income taxes , which are progressive taxes, 
to property and sales tax,es and fees, ~hlch are 
regressive means of obtaining revenue. Thlsisoosur-
prise because the proponents of Proposition One are 
primarily wealthy individuals and corporations; The 
great emphasis put on the 7112 % Income tax credit that 
would come with Prop. 1's approval would give the 
median Calif. family, earning $13,000, about 10-12 
extra dollars next year. That's all. (Thereafter, no tax 
credit is guaranteed, as is commonly assumed.) People 
earning less than $13,000 would save much less than 
that. However, wealthy families earning say $50,000-
100 000 would save many hundreds of dollars. Ob-Vio~sIY, this means the state Income taxes will yield 
much less money. Yet, people will expect the state to 
maintain many services. Thus, Proposition 1 will allow 
sales and property taxes and fees to be Increased. 
Economic studies consistantly show that these three 
revenue sources, just mentioned, take a much larger 
percentage of income from poor and middle income 
families than they do from wealthy families . (That Is 
the definition of regressive taxes.) Therefore, the 
savings gained via the 7V2% income tax credit by 
everyone except the very wealthy may be completely 
eaten up by these local taxes and fees. Now you know 
'for whom' the lower taxes are meant.. .and for whom 
the lower taxes are not meant. 

Now let's see which state government services might 
be hindered or eliminated if Prop. 1 were to pass. The 
state's nonpartisan leg islatlve analyst A. Alan Post has 
put forth the following programs as " likely to be cut " If 
Prop. 1 should pass : 

AREA Reduction in millions 

decrease police training programs 8.9 

Senior Citizen Property Tax 
Assistance Program 18 

41 Renters Tax Relief 
Food and Ag ricul ture 
control and eradication of pests 8 

Consumer Affairs 8.6 

Gov 't Regulation of Corporations 
3.5 and Banks 

Parks and Recreation

'Causes For Impeachment 
ACLU 

Richard Nixon has not left us In doubt. He means to 
function above the law. If he Is allowed to continue , 
then the destruction of the Bill of Rights could follow . 
If, after all the Watergate revelations, we allow ~Im to 
continue, we are accomplices to that destruction. 

Consider what has already happened : 
On July 23, 1970, the President persc:mally approved 

the "Huston plan" for political survellance by such 
methods as burglary, wiretapping, eavesdropping, mail 
covers and spying on students by the CIA and o~her 
agencies. These methods were employ~ against 
dissenters, political opponents, netls reporters, and 
government employees. 

In 1971 the PresIdent established within the White 
House a' personal secret police (the "plumbers"), 
operating outside the restraints of law, and engaging In 
burglary, illegal wiretaps, espionag~ and perjury. 

While Daniel Ellsberg ' was faCing trial, hiS 
psychiatric records were burglarized by White House 
aides and at the direction of the President, a White 
House aid~ discussed the directorship of the FBI with 
the judge presiding over Ellsberg's tr!al. . 

Private detectives were hired by Wtllte House ald~s 
to spy on the sex life, drinking habits and family 
problems of political opponents. 

Supporters of possible presidenti~1 oppon,~nts of 
President Nixon were marked as enemies on a 
special list , and targeted for harassment by the Internal 
Revenue Service. 

During three days in May 1971, over 13,000 people 
were illegally arrested in Washington , D.C .. The dragnet 
arrests, unprecedented in American hiStOry,. were 
declared unconstitutional by the court.s:. To justify ~he 
arrests a White House spokesman, WllliamRehnqulst , invent~d the doctrine of "qualified marti~1 law." 

In 1973 the President bombed Cambodia, a neutral 
country :.vithout the authorization of Congress, We 
learned 'later that he had been bombing Cambodia for 
three years and had deliberately concealed the bom-
bing from Congress and from the people, thereby 
usurping the war-making powers of Co.ngress. ~hen 
the deception was revealed, the PreSident said he 
would do the same thing under similar circ~m~tances , 

The President has transformed grand Junes into 
instruments of political surveillance and harass.nnent , 
and caused politically motivated indictments to Issue. 

The President has attacked the freedom of the 
press and subjected news reporters to illegal wiretaps 
and harassing FBI investigations. 

The doctrine of "inherent" power 

Richard Nixon is not the first president to violate 
constitutional rights and he will not be the last. But no 
president has ever before systematically claimed that 
the Bill of Rights, wh ich limits other .government of-
ficials does not limit the President or hiS agents., , Wh~n he wiretapped in violation of the Constitution 
he claimed an "i nherent" power to do so. 

When he secretly bombed Cambodia, he claimed an 
"inherent" power to do so. 

When he directed the dragnet arrests of thousands of 
demonstrators in Washington, he claimed an 
"inherent" power to do so. . 

If the President is permitted to use the doctnne of 
" inherent" powe:r to override the Biil of Rights ~nytime 
he pleases, civil liberties can be cancelled at whim . . 

The President of the United States should symbolize 
our system of individual rights under law. He sets the 
precedent forfuture presidents. As U.S. Supreme court 
Justice Louis Brandeis said in a 1928 wiretapping 
case: 
In a govemment of laws, existence of the government 
will be Imperiled If It falls to observe the law 
scrupulously. Our government Is the potent, the 
omnipresent teacher. For good or for III, It teaches the 
whole people by Its example. Crime Is contagious. II 
the government becomes a law-breaker, It breeds 
contempt for law; It Invites every man to become a law 
unto himself; It Invites anarchy. To declare that In the 
admlnlstretlon of law ... the end justifies the mean-
s would bring terrible retribution. 
. T~ preserve and protect our syste.m of indivl,dual 

rights under law, to restore the integnty of the Bill of 
Rights for us and our children , and to make the lesson 
clear to all future presidents in whose hands we place 
our lives Richard Nixon must stand trial before the 
Senate. If he does not stand trial , what he has done will 
be done by others.

planets as gods and attributed specific spiritual 
qualities to what he saw in the sky. It is argued by the 
modern scientist that such Ideas contribute nothing of 
value to our understanding and Indeed lead us astray. 
But when this same scientist walks up to his telescope 
or cyclotron, he carrle.s with him a set of axioms that 
are just as much a part of his psyche as the 
unquestioned concepts In the mind of an ancient 
Babylonian astronomer climbing to the too of a

In The Name 
Of Jesus •••• 

Opinion, by Don Maker 

"You come along, tearing your shirt, yelling about 
Jesus. Where do you get that stuff? What do you know 
abou t Jesus? Jesus had a way of talking soft. ., Go 
ahead and bust all the chairs you want to. Smash a 
whole wagon load of furniture at every performance. 
Turn sixty somersaults and stand on you nutty head! If 
it wasn't for the way you scared the women and kids I'd 
feel sorry for you and pass the hat." From. "To a 
Contemporary Bunkshooter", by Carl Sandburg. 

A man generally know as "Holy" Hubert spent a 
couple of hours on the Revelle Plaza Friday, spreading 
Christ's word of love, peace, and harmony. The cr~wd 
badgered him, cursed him, and generally detested him. 
Some of the Christians in the crowd were appalled and 
upset by him. The reason Mr. Hubert gave was, "Tell 
men the truth, and you'll be hated on this campus." 

Hubert stated that any radical who spoke on campus 
wOuld not be treated as badly as he was. Although this 
point might be argued, I have never hea~d his prime 
example of a "radical", Stokely Carmichael , co~­
sistently scream at , insult, curse and condemn hiS 
audience as "Holy" Hubert did on this occassion , 

I do not question the love Mr. Hubert bears for 
Christ. Nor do I condemn him for the antipathy and 
repugnance for Christ's message that he insti.lI~ in his 
audience. As pointed out by another Christian, we 
cannot judge his methods for preaching the gospel. 

But I feel that it is not necessary to use the spec-
tacular carnival-barker technique that "radicals" use for 
the purpose of Interesting people in Christ. If the 
students of UCSD are as intelligent as I think they are, 
they will not allow themselves to be turned off to God 
merely because th~y do not like the tactics one of His 
preachers used. 

Approach Christ as you would any other matter of 
importance: with Intelligence, thoroughness, and 
above all , an open mind. It is not necessary to go to a 
Church if you do not desire; there are many rational 
Christians here on campus. Try talking to one. You 
might be surprised at what you can learn.

How well put , Mr . 
Richard M. Nixon (October 
1968). He was, of course 
referring to the Johnson 
admin istration. But now , in 
1973, we may marvel at its 
current , glaring t ruth . As 
Science (Octo ,-,r 19 , 1973) 
so well summarizes: 
"The impact of the Nixon 
administration's decision 
to curtail spending has 
been most conspicuous in 
the biological sciences, 
where support of young 
postdoctoral researchers 
through the National In-
stitutes of Health Training 
Grant Program has been 
cut back dramatically." 

I personally have felt the 
crush of the financial vice. I 
would like to look forward 
to a reversal of the current 
trend which so badly 
threatens our advancement 
of science at a maximal 
rate.

Lettau 
Lashed 

Editor : 
Editorial Director, Triton 
Times : 

Dr. Reinhard Lettau's 
visclous attack on Jim 
Soto's " Losing Sleep Over 
Chile" column sub-
stantiates Soto's charge 
that , to a leftist , "a fascist 
is someone who disagrees 
with you ." 

Certainly "Losing Sleep 
Over Chile" was full of 
" bloated rhetoric", but it 
also raised serious and 
relevant charges which 
Lettau Ignored, prefering , it 
would seem, the easy road 
of fighting fire with fire , 
bloated rhetoric with 
bloated rhetoriC, mud with 
mud. 

Did Allende encourage 
(or at least fail to 
discourage) the "formation 
of paramilitary 
organizations?" Did he 
willfully disregard the 
limits of the Chilean 
constitution? Is there 
substantiated evidence of 
direct U.S. involvement 
(CIA etc ,)? Lettau does not 
even attempt to answer 
these charges . 

Furthermore, Lettau's 
adjectives--"sick", "John 
Birch " , " i nhuman e", 
"barbarian" , " fascist", and 
"Gestapo"-- imply that Mr. 
Soto's article favored the 
military junta and the coup. 
On the contrary, Soto saw 
the coup as the exchange 
of one tyrant by another. 
Basically , Soto feels that 
the U.S. was not 
responsible for what 
happened to Allende . 
Presumably , Dr. Lettau 
disagrees . Soto feels that 
Allende was a dictator 
rather than a democrat. Dr. 
Lettau disagrees. 

But , disagreement with 
Dr. Lettau is not the 
definition of fascism. In a 
free society a free press is 
obligated to present dif-
fering opinions, but Dr. 
Lettau deems all differing 
opinions to be " un i n-
formed , illiterate , and 
inhumane." The leading 
newspapers and the Triton 
Times are blasted for at-
tempting to fulfill their 
obligation , while Dr. Lettau 
punishes a paper that puts 
the ideal of freedom of the 
press into practice by 
refusing to send it any 
more of his poems , 

I believe that Dr. Lettau 
owes Jim Soto and the 
Triton Times an apology. 
His letter was a gross 
overreaction and his 
charges were unfair and 
untrue. I hope he will 
reconsider his decision not 
to send in his poetry.

Salute To Pigs 

UNTITLED V 

Easy Wins In First Tourneys 
Highlight Badminton Meetings 

The Women's and Coed 
Badminton teams have 
glided through the first 
three tournaments un-
defeated. With each ad-
ditional confrontation , ~he 
scores get progressively 
better. 

The Tritons began their 
winning streak by up-
setting one of the stronger 
teams in the league, 
Grossmont, 7 - 6. While the 
total score was tight , the 
in d i v.i d u a I mat c h e s 
produced impressive 

When meet ing Mesa 
College, these badminton. 
enthusiasts showed the 
confidence they had gained 
by taking the tournament 9 
- 4. In a repeat per-
formance, Cheryl scooped 
up her victories with a 
graceful ease, while the 
women's doubles duo of 
Renee Ricketts and Tenry 
Lieverstein earned their 
second victory. 

Tuesday's opposition 

Chen and M.C. Lui 
demonstrated their f ine 
agility. 

At the end of three 
tournaments, UCSD stands 
as the only undefeated 
team in the league. But the 
most crucial tournament 6f 
the season is yet to come --
Tuesday, November 6 at 
Grossmont. 

Last Wednesday was 
Halloween - as I'm sure all 
you fat little trick or 
treaters know - and the pigs 
were out In full bloom at 
Revelle. Of course the pigs 
are sporadically around 
most of the year but 
Halloween Is different and 
the animals feel as though 
they have an excuse - a 
rat lonallzat ion for 
existence as If Halloween 
allows them to be pigs. 

When I first came to the 
Big U I was expecting 
utopia. Young liberals , it 
seemed, were all at the 
university and they had 
such great ideas and high 
aspirations that for certain , 
I thought, the un Iversity, 
would have an ideal at-
mosphere. It would be a 
place full of consideration, 
love, caring and respon-
sible people. Of course I 
was sadly mistaken . 

The young liberals with 
the great ideas and 
aspirations were just as 
bad - If not worse - than the 
establishment they were 
foresaking. Of course this 
was a profound disclosure 
for a mere freshman who 
was naive and didn't know 
anything about life at all. 
The leading faction of this 
group is the pig group. 

One can always tell 
where the pigs have been -
it's almost a sport - like pig 
hunting or following (I had 

by Mark Liska 
to slip that In since this Is a 
sports column). There's 
always a pile of trash 
wherever they've been. 

People say pigs are nice 
and can be an acceptable 
part of society - especially 
since they make a sport out 
of living for everyone else 
trying not to be a pig . Ever 
tried eating in the cafeteria 
with a gaggle of olnkers 
around? There you are, 
digging into your pudding 
and plop, a pork chop lands 
in your dish and you're 
wiping the chocolate off 
your shirt. As you get up to 
get another napkin you trip 
- just II~ in the movies -
on an undercooked and 
greasy FrenCh-fried potato. 
The best strategy in dealing 
with the cafeteria porkers is 
to spot a table in a highly 
defensible corner. Thele 
you can watch incoming 
objects and speedily 
protect yourself with a fast 
moving tray - block. Of 
course another alternative 
is to just not eat . 

Of course the pigg les are 
out in full force on 
Halloween night. On this 
night they all gather .Into 

. the confines of Argo Hall 
for their annual convention 
- because they don't have 
anything else interesting to 
do In Argo so the pigs 
themselves say. They all 
come prepared for their 
greatest presentation of the 

Clinic And Game 

year, the Argo Hall 
Halloween Water Fight. 

Pigs aren't Interested in 
history; they're interested 
in setting precedents . It 
doesn't bother them that 
last year $200 worth of 
damage happened at the 
Halloween fiasco last year. 
They wanted to set 
precedents and they did. 
This year was bigger and 
better than ever! 

Of course the pigs have 
excuses. Water balloons 
and food fights are fun. 
There's nothing else to do 
on a week night without a 
car and what's wrong with a 
couple of friendly fiascos. 
Why should It matter that 
inflation causes food 
prices to rise constantl y? 
Who cares whether others 
have little to eat , th is 
society is so advanced that 
today, at UCSD people can 
throw food. I'd say that's 
pretty good for people who 
are old enough to vote, old 
enough to fight and die, 
who will in a couple years 
be out In the big world and 
who, according to the law 
and many times to 
themselves, are adults. 

Here's a little in-
formation for all you pigs 
to come up with some 
answers for. 

At last count there were 
eight broken windows, two 
broken exit signs, ,$600 
worth of damage and two 
injured girls . 

scores like Cheryl Landay's 
11-3, 11-1 victories. The 
mixed doubles, proving to 
be the backbone of this 
team, produced the five 
victories needed to bring 
UCSD to the victory stand. 

against Southwestern 
ended in an Inspiring score 
of 11 -1. As predicted, 
Cheryl stands undefeated 
in women's singles. The 
mixed doubles followed 
through with four great 
victories ; the most im-
pressive being that of Lee 
Thompson a~d Richard 
Chen with scores of 15 - 1 
and 15 - 2. At this time, all 
mixed doubles stand 
undefeated.

As far as the "myth" you 
referred to, about Black 
men being able to satisfy 
their women sexually, I'd 
liketo be the first to inform 
yOU, It's no myth. With the 
majority of Black people 
sex is a naturally beautiful 
thing that has no bounds 
on satisfaction. Sex is a 
whiteman's worry, he is the 
one who is afraid he can't 
satisfy you sexually, that's 
why there is a "myth ." 

Blackmen have the same 
number one thing they've 
had, since living in this 
country America. A strong 
back, and a never-ending 
sweet disposition towards 
sex. Don't get me wrong 
and feel that's the only 
thing we know best, but ,

It is clear, as even some of the proponents admit, many 
of the state's services that are in the public interest will 
have to be eliminated. 

In conclusion therefore, CALPIRG takes a very 
strong stand against Proposition One because it 
curtails valuable government services and , more im-
portantly, It further shifts the burden of the remaining 
social services via regressive taxation onto those 
already overburdened by taxes. The public interest 
must be served by true tax reform and not by 
Prop osition One .
