Allegations of student exploi-
tation have caused the Graduate 
Student Association to begin drafting 
a bill of rights to protect the graduate 
community. 

According to GSA President Alex 
James, a bill- of-rights committee was 

created to draft a document modeled 
after similar bills created by other UC 
graduate organizations. 

The idea was first proposed last 
year after GSA  leaders were noti-
fied that certain students had suf-
fered from unfair labor practices. 
According to GSA VP of Internal 
Affairs John Alaniz, professors can 
exploit foreign students by capital-
izing on their pressure to perform. 

“If an international student was 
fired, he would have to leave the 
country, go through immigration and 
find a new job,” he said. “In com-
parison, if a state student was fired, 

he would not have the same sense of 
urgency and the same consequences 
to face.”

Although Alaniz declined to pro-
vide specific examples, he said GSA 
has received reports of university 
individuals who take advantage of 
this situation, making these already 
disadvantaged students work harder 
than state students. 

One of the most important pro-
visions of the bill is the “right to 
arbitration,” under which a set of 
guidelines allow for dispute and 
resolve between a student and supe-
rior. The “right to arbitration” provi-

sion would ensure students know 
they have a right to dispute unfair 
practices, he said. 

“We want students to know that if 
there’s a dispute, they have the right 
to address it without worry,” Alaniz 
said. “We just want them to know 
they can approach the department 
and can bring their disagreements 
to light.”

The current draft also asks that 
the university create more holidays 
for graduate students. Although 
graduate students teach, they are not

UCSD
Looks
into Law 
School

By Andrew Tieu
Contributing Writer

After decades happily buried in 
graduate engineering and microbi-
ology, UCSD finally has something 
besides science on the brain.

UCSD and the San Diego-based 
California Western School of Law 
have formed a joint committee to 
discuss the creation of a UCSD law 
school. 

Instead of having to build a new 
campus, the program would use 
the present Cal Western facilities 
under the UCSD name.

The two institutes currently 
offer a joint master’s program in 
health law, under which credits can 
be earned toward a UCSD degree. 

According to Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Paul Drake, 
the proposal to merge the two 
schools is tentative, so no concrete 
timeline has been established. 

However, Drake said the 
school’s history of collaboration 
makes the newest proposal more 
feasible. 

“What’s great about this plan 
is we’re not starting from scratch,” 
Drake said. 

Similar proposals for a merg-
er date as far back as the 1980s, 
but have always fallen through 
because the law school was deemed 
an unnecessary cost by the state. 
According to Steven Smith, dean of 
Cal Western, the new collaboration 
is likely to be successful because it 
will rely on the existing resources 
of both universities instead of pub-
lic funding. 

“The old proposal involved a 
great deal of public funding, and 
that was a problem,” Smith said. 
“With the current financial strength 
of CWSL, the proposed combination 
is self-funding.”

Thirty years after the 
first try, UCSD proposes 
a merge with California 
Western School of Law.

Say ‘goodbye’ to that 15-minute reprieve 
from lecture at the end of every quarter: As 

of this winter, students won’t be 
assessing their professors during 
classtime anymore.

Instead, Course and Professor 
Evaluations — a student orga-
nization that administers course 

evaluations — will move the entire evaluations 
process online.  

C.A.P.E. was founded 38 years ago, when a 
large  part of its service was publishing results in 

an annual hardcopy book. Now, the organization 
will offer online evaluations during the ninth 
and 10th week of classes, and post the results 
after final grades are due.

C.A.P.E. director Alan Lam said the transi-
tion is caused by budget cuts: The service does 
not have the money to pay 50 student runners to 
distribute the evaluations to classrooms. 

Associate Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey, who regulates the 
program, said that moving the evaluations 
online may save up to $50,000 in annual salary 
and paper costs.

UCSD EXTENSION PICKS UP WHERE PHIL 14 FAILED YOU.

MARKET ONTHE

With the national unemployment rate at a staggering 16-year high of 7.2 percent, job seekers across the nation are looking for anything to give themselves a competitive edge — even if it means going back to school. 
That’s why UCSD Extension, the professional education and public-ser-

vice division of UCSD, hasn’t been hurt by campuswide cuts. For many recent 
college graduates, it’s been a stepping stone  — and resume booster — to bet-
ter job prospects.

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

According to Lam, moving the ser-

vice online will help simplify the evalu-
ation process and save 250,000 pieces 
of paper. 

“With the online C.A.P.E.s, we will 
have a less error-prone rate of dis-
tributing and collecting the results,” 
Lam said. 

All classes will continue to receive 
C.A.P.E. evaluations. Each student will 
receive an e-mail from C.A.P.E. with 
a link to a personalized “class list” 
Web site, where they will find evalua-
tion forms for each class. Students can 
revise their evaluations until midnight 
before the first day of finals. 

The questions on the form will 
remain identical to ones administered 
in previous years, and will continue to 
be anonymous. 

C.A.P.E. launched an online pilot 
to test the program during Summer 
Session 2009. Initial results were posi-
tive: 98 percent of classes contributed 
responses, compared to 75 percent in 
the 2008 Summer Session, which used 
the paper evaluations. 

However, since Summer Session 
class sizes are much smaller than those 

in fall, winter and spring, Lam said he 
expects the online program to be slow 
at first.

“Initially, the response rate is going 
to be low,” Lam said. “Our main goal 
right now is to boost student aware-
ness.”

Warren sophomore Katie Chen, 
who said she uses C.A.P.E. results 
to help choose her class schedule, 
expressed doubts about whether stu-
dents would use the program in its 
online form.

“I’ll still take the time to fill it out, 
but I have a feeling that a lot of other 
students won’t,” Chen said. 

C.A.P.E. directors are planning 
to team up with the A.S. Council 
to promote “C.A.P.E. Week” later in 
the quarter. Together, they will send 
e-mail reminders to students about 
the change, and set up an information 
table on campus about the new setup.

According to Lam, C.A.P.E. has 
revamped its Web site. In addition, 
the organization plans on sending 
out e-mail reminders to students who 
haven’t completed all their evaluations. 

Students who do complete the 
online forms will be entered into a 

raffle for Triton Cash cards.
C.A.P.E. Assistant Director Ben 

Lewin said he is not worried about 
lower student turnout biasing the 
evaluations. In contrast, he said the 
online system should result in a wider 
variety of students participating in the 
program. 

“Students who choose not to go to 
class regularly may fill out the evalua-
tions, and have more representation in 
the results,” Lewin said. 

Sawrey said the new system will 
benefit professors as well. 

“Staff will benefit with a full assur-
ance that all students will have an 
opportunity to provide feedback,” 
Sawrey said. “Faculty will not lose any 
class time, since students will fill out 
the surveys outside of class.”

Lam said the evaluations come 
in handy for professors as well, who 
ask for their forms as exit evaluations 
when they move on to new positions. 

He said he believes the new system 
will make for a fairer course-evaluation 
process. 

According to Sawrey, the idea to 
move C.A.P.E. online was proposed for 
the last several years by C.A.P.E. direc-

tors. She said the new system will allow 
students more time to complete evalu-
ations, which in turn benefits staff. 

Sawrey said she that the new online 
system will open up the possibility 
of specialized C.A.P.E. evaluations for 
TAs, labs and seminars in the future.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS
Smith said the law school has 

enough money — from tuition, 
income and grants — to cover opera-
tional costs.  

The UC Irvine School of Law, 
which opened Fall Quarter 2009, 
offered free tuition to its inaugural 
class, and halved tuition for the fol-
lowing year’s class, in hopes of attract-
ing top students.

However, UCSD’s new law school 
would not be able to grant a similar 
amount of free tuition. 

Smith said that San Diego is one 
of the few large cities without a law 
school, and the necessity for one has 
become increasingly important in the 
years since a partnership with Cal 
Western was first proposed. 

“The legal profession has become 
increasingly interdisciplinary, and 
needs connections to other academic 
programs,” Smith said. “Both UC San 
Diego and California Western have 
become much more sophisticated and 
more mature institutions in the last 30 
years, and both have improved.”

He added that the proposal is 
likely to succeed this time because 
the UC Board of Regents has become 
more open-minded in its approach 

to law schools. In addition to estab-
lishing the law school at UC Irvine 
last year, the regents 
have indicated that 
UC Riverside should 
consider a law school 
as well.

The details of the 
merger are presently 
undecided, but com-
mittee discussions 
have ranged from the 
affiliation of certain 
minor programs to 
complete acquisition 
of Cal Western by 
UCSD. 

One area of con-
cern is the differing 
academic priori-
ties between the two 
schools. While UCSD 
is a top research uni-
versity, Cal Western places limited 
emphasis in the area. 

“Cal Western will have to adapt to 
UCSD standards in research,” Drake 
said. 

He said that it is difficult for a 
new law school to break rankings, 
especially because the top-ranked law 
schools have held their positions for 

decades. Both Smith and Drake said 
they hope to move into the top 30 or 

40 national rankings eventually. 
Warren College junior Emma 

Chan, who has visited the Cal 
Western campus, said she sees 
a disconnect between the two 
campuses. 

“Cal Western has a differ-
ent vibe,” Chan said. “I feel 
like UCSD will just go in and 
restructure it.”

However, Warren College 
junior Josh Grossman said the 
idea is financially practical.

“The new law school seems 
like a good idea, especially for 
visibility, as it would increase 
UCSD’s prestige,” Grossman said. 
“I would go to a UCSD law school 
because it would be cheaper than 
private law schools.”

The proposal for a merger 
will be officially drawn up in May or 
June of this year. It must be approved 
by Cal Western, UCSD, the UC Office 
of the President and the UC Board of 
Regents, which would probably hap-
pen by early 2011.

considered staff, and thus do not 
receive any vacation days other than 
national holidays. For example, they 
do not receive days off during Spring 
Break. 

Alaniz said that all these provi-
sions are meant to reduce the strain 
on graduate students.

“Graduate students are under a lot 
of stress, and are some of the greatest 
consumers of student mental-health 
services on campus,” he said. “We 
want to protect these students who 
are working and teaching, juggling a 

lot of responsibility and in a tenuous 
position.”

The bill is currently being dis-
cussed within the GSA and Grad Life, 
a committee of faculty and graduate 
students. 

After the bill is finalized, it must 
be approved by GSA, the faculty sen-
ate and Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
before it is passed.

Although the bill has not been 
officially brought to the chancellor’s 
office, it was discussed at the town 
hall meeting last Wednesday, where 
Fox voiced preliminary support for 

the initiative. 
“We haven’t looked at it care-

fully, but we’d be happy to do what 
we can,” she said. “I think it’s a great 
idea.”

Alaniz said the GSA committee 
hopes to have the bill passed by the 
end of this year. 

“We hope this is something we do 
once, and then will help the rest of 
the graduate student population for a 
long time,” Alaniz said.

ON CAMPUS —  Before making any commitments 
on WebReg, students try to find out which profes-
sors give easy ‘A’s, whose lectures are worth listening 
to and what sort of workload to expect. But now 
that UCSD’s most reliable evaluation service has 
moved its surveys online, students may soon be 
picking their classes in the dark.

This quarter, due to funding cuts from UCSD’s 
Course and Professor Evaluation program, students 
will assess their professors in an online survey 
instead of in the lecture hall. 

The new C.A.P.E. system might save some paper, 

but a more casual online presence might make its 
existence — and the efforts of all those involved — 
entirely pointless. 

In the past, every student who happened to 
show up to lecture the day C.A.P.E. evaluations were 
administered would voluntarily take a few moments 
to tell the program what they thought of the class. 
It was a way to ensure that every type of student 
— from sleepy slacker to eager-eyed overachiever — 
had a voice in the system. 

The online version guarantees a slant in the 
turnout. While we all find plenty of time stalk 

perfect strangers and watch videos of angry babies 
online, we often don’t fill out the gobs of monoto-
nous surveys that flood our ACS accounts. Taking 
the time to fill out online C.A.P.E. evaluations won’t 
be any different. It’s a lot easier to ignore an e-mail 
— or simply click “delete” — than brush off the fel-
low student handing you a C.A.P.E. form (and giv-
ing you the evil eye until you fill it out). 

Even C.A.P.E. Director Alan Lam said that par-
ticipation will plummet.

The dry, monotonous spiel about why our country is so great — to the chorus of 
laugh-track applause — could only be expected 
from the State of the Union address. However, 
after about five minutes of red, white and 
blue blabber, something strange happened: I 
experienced that same year-old warm, fuzzy 
feeling of Obama-engendered hope. For just a 
moment, it seemed our country might improve 
its economy, helping the everyman secure a 
breadwinning job.

Even if Obama’s speech was just another bril-
liantly brainwashing script, the visuals — Wall 
Street shelling out dollar bills to the little guys, 
the U.S. doubling its exports to increase produc-
tivity and employment, not going broke just to 
go to college — were delivered perfectly. From 
pausing to flash his pearly whites to raising 
his voice in mock-Evangelist call-and-response, 
Obama proved that — even if he can’t bring 
about immediate, palpable change — he can still 
deliver one hell of a one-man show. And that, 
given our broken economy and divided popula-
tion, might be motivation enough for the rest of 
us to make it happen. (Not to mention it made 
for quality television.)

We can all roll our eyes at the optimistic 
tone reverberating through the White House. 
But at the end of the day, the belief that our 
nation can make a necessary shift for the better 
is all we have to hang onto. 

Obama was able to inspire, and sometimes 
a little pep-talk is all we need to take the next 
step.

With an approval rating now hovering at 48 percent, President Barack Obama 
entered last Wednesday night’s State of the 
Union address with a weighty task at hand: to 
convince us that, under his guidance, the coun-
try is back on the right track. 

Obama did well to call on the other branch-
es of the government to do their part; even his 
own party, he noted, has the largest congres-
sional majority it’s seen in decades, but would 
rather “run for the hills” than work toward that 
elusive change.

One man can’t singlehandedly alter our 
national course without the help of a willing 
congress — which too many of the president’s 
critics fail to remember. 

Though the focus of his speech was largely 
on the importance of creating new jobs — an 
issue that affects all of us — Obama was wise to 
target more specific groups, such as college stu-
dents and the gay community, to boost morale.

He declared that 2010 will be the year we 
witness the end of the military’s “don’t ask, 
don’t tell” policy, and that all who want a col-
lege education will be able to afford one, given 
the extension of the national government’s Pell 
Grant program. 

In fact, Obama did such a good job of cov-
ering all his niche bases — military families, 
gays and broke students, too — that a reported 
83 percent of viewers, according to a CBS News 
poll, responded positively to the speech. 

So whether or not there’s change, at least we 
all seem to believe in it.

— Trevor Cox
Opinion Editor 

In Wednesday’s State of the Union address, President Obama said the top domestic priority 
for 2010 will be creating jobs. And indeed, unem-
ployment is a very immediate concern. 

But it also reminds us how desperately he needs 
support from the middle class.

The House already passed a $174-billion bill to 
create new jobs last December. The bill’s fate is now 
up to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid 
(D-Nevada) said it will be the first major legislation 
taken up after the health-care reform bill is com-
pleted.

Now, the address’ main proposals — building 
clean energy facilities, giving rebates to Americans 
who make their homes more energy-efficient and 
providing tax breaks to companies that create jobs 
in the U.S. — look promising to those who didn’t 
benefit from last year’s economic stimulus package.

Faced with voter anxiety over high unemploy-
ment, Obama’s fellow Democrats are at risk of losing 
big in November’s congressional elections. Amid 
eroding support from middle-class Americans, 
Obama is worried he’ll lose party majorities in the 
House and the Senate.

That’s probably why he felt he needed to men-
tion the word “jobs” 29 times in his speech to 
Congress. 

This was Obama’s attempt to show the middle 
class that he understands their financial predica-
ment. Restoring his popularity with the middle class 
is the only way for the Democrats to secure con-
trol of the House and Senate. Whether or not the 
employment bill actually ends up on top of his desk 
pile, Obama intends to come out a hero.

Oh, Winter Quarter —  notori-ously dull, sexless and devoid of the carefree hookups 
famous to sunny San Diego. If you 
have your eye on a willing acquain-
tance, co-worker or TA, but don’t 
know quite how to take the plunge, 
wonder no more. Beat your winter 
dry spell with an after-hours hot-tub 
hookup — one of the most tried and 
true settings for seduction. 

First off, you don’t actually need 
your own hot tub to get down in one. 
Most La Jolla complexes (many with 
low, hoppable gates) are equipped 
with a hot, bubbly body of water, and 
any Jacuzzi within walking distance is 
fair game. 

Second, you’ll need suitable attire. 
If the hot-tub session is spontaneous, 

chances are slim that your hookup-
to-be will be toting swim trunks or a 
cute bikini, so improvise. Strip down 
to your unmentionables. Guys: no 
T-shirts. Girls: nothing baggy. You 
both know where the night is going, 
so the sooner you loosen cumbersome 
clothing, the better. 

You and your next conquest must 
be alone for your plan to succeed. A 
group setting will lead to the inevita-
ble game of 10 fingers, eliminating all 
chances of getting anywhere — unless 
all involved are down for grouplovin’. 
Junior-high games will also takes the 
focus off you two, posing the possibil-
ity that you or your unwitting friends 
might reveal one too many hot-tub 
hookups past. Plus, there’s nothing 
worse than the awkward moment 
when the rest of the group exits the 
tub while you and your hookup-to-be 
linger, making your horny intentions 
uncomfortably clear.

The final item on your must-do 
list is obvious: Buy wine. Lots of it. If 
this is your first time hooking up in 
a public place, heavy intoxication is 
necessary. A bottle of two-buck Chuck 
will do fine — after all, class in a hot 
tub is certainly not key. 

Now that you’re drunk and half-
naked, floating in a pool of swirling, 
slightly nauseating foam, it’s time 
to get intimate. Ask those burn-
ing questions you’d never whip out 
in review session. Challenge your 
tub buddy to an innocent wrestling 
match. With most of your clothes 
and inhibitions gone, it’s time to 
move in for the kill.

How far you are willing to go in 
the hot tub is a matter of personal 
comfort. Feelings of shame or para-
noia might bubble, but in most cases, 
it’s best to ignore them. Every rus-
tling pinecone or squeaky fence will 
have you convinced that an elderly 
grandmother or group of preschool-
ers is about to walk in on your kinky 
escapade. These are the most glorious 
moments of your undergraduate exis-
tence — not a time for modesty. 

At the very worst, a pervy security 
guard might force you to sheepishly 
climb out of the hot tub, collect your 
discarded clothes and stumble off 
back to your room (or the shuttle 
stop) — but don’t let Mr. Officer put a 
damper on your night. How-to Guru 
knows firsthand that in winter, there’s 
no greater priority than finding cre-
ative ways to stay warm.

OPINION� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

In order for C.A.P.E. results to be 
accurate, they should reflect a slice 
of students that attended the class. 
When the questionnaire goes digital, 
it runs the risk that every voluntary 
survey poses: Only those with strong 
opinions — whether it’s the puppy-
dog brown-noser or the asshole who 
wants revenge for his ‘F’ — will par-
ticipate. 

With the change of venue, 
C.A.P.E. won’t have much advan-
tage over RateMyProfessors.com, 
where opinions are typically con-
centrated at extreme ends of the 
spectrum. The students who write on 
RateMyProfessors.com either have a 
huge vendetta to fulfill or couldn’t get 
enough of the Dimensions of Culture 
series; what’s made C.A.P.E. so valu-

able in the past, however, is that it 
sampled everyone — including those 
who fall in the middle who might, for 
instance, help determine how many 
hours of work the course requires. 

Though the age-old raffle strategy 
works for some orgs, C.A.P.E.’s one-
in-60 chance at a $10 Triton Cash gift 
certificate probably won’t convince 
anyone to take a 10-minute survey.

One way to eliminate the appar-
ently costly runners would be to pair 
the C.A.P.E. program with individual 
departments. The chemistry depart-
ment, among others, already has its 
own separate evaluation that profes-
sors distribute. It wouldn’t be a big 
stretch to simply require that profes-
sors hand out C.A.P.E. evaluations 
and return them to the department. 

After all, CAPE isn’t just for stu-

dents; professors, too, often use their 
evaluations as letters of recommenda-
tion as they move to other universi-
ties. The forms are already anony-
mous, anyway, so there’s no need to 
worry a professor would see.

Even though C.A.P.E. is planning 
on partnering with the A.S. Council 
to spread student awareness for 
the new online system, there is no 
amount of fliers or booths on Library 
Walk that will be able to ensure the 
high participation rate the program 
currently boasts. While C.A.P.E. may 
be taking a step in eco-friendliness 
by going digital, it’s taking two costly 
steps back in thoroughness and accu-
racy.

Dear Editor,
As reported in the Jan. 28 article 

“Council Excuses Senator Absences, 
Re-examines Loft,” A.S. Advocate 
General Parminder Sandhu proposed 
a resolution of impeachment for three 
senators. 

Unfortunately, councilmembers 
thought it made for good politics to 
not vote to impeach the aforemen-
tioned senators. I understand that 
councilmembers do not want to 
antagonize their colleagues, but not 
impeaching those who have hor-
rendous attendance records sends the 
clear message that one will never be 
held accountable for one’s actions and 
duties in council. The same council 
that was worried about donating 
money to Haiti is clearly setting a dan-
gerous precedent for unaccountability 
among its own members. 

I understand that councilmembers 
have to juggle numerous responsi-
bilities in addition to serving their 
constituents. However, if a senator or 
associate vice president is continually 
absent and not held accountable for 
doing his job, then how else are his 
constituents’ interests adequately rep-
resented? How will students take the 
A.S. Council and its work seriously 
when the members of the said council 
do not take their jobs seriously? 

Accruing more than three absenc-
es not only makes a councilmember 

look incompetent and irresponsible, 
but it clearly conveys the fact that 
the said councilmember does not 
care about his job and constituents. 
It boggles my mind that some coun-
cilmembers have already racked up 
7.5 absences and are now pathetically 
begging and kowtowing to not be 
impeached for their ineptitude. 

If the A.S. Council wishes to be 
more efficient in its representation 
of students’ interests, then swift pun-
ishment must be meted out to the 
incompetent few. Otherwise, they will 
continue to miss council meetings and 
concoct weak excuses as to why they 
were absent. Rewarding those unfit to 
serve students’ interests makes for bad 
governance. If the A.S. Council were a 
business, most of its employees would 
have been fired already for their poor 
attendance records. Councilmembers 
must view the work they do as 
another important job — not some 
additional extracurricular activity to 
be added on their resume. 

— Victor Lin 
A.S. Physical Sciences Senator

Founded in 1966, UCSD Extension offers classes that focus on 
developing technical skills, aimed at fast-track students and devel-
oping adult professionals in San Diego. With 14 different areas of 
study — including digital arts, business, law, education and health 
care — Extension offers a more practical variety, compared to the 
“let there be light” academic focus of university curriculum.

By constantly updating its course offerings to keep up with 
trends in the job market — particularly in high-tech fields like in-
formation technology and software engineering — Extension has 
seen record-breaking enrollment over the last two years. Within 
the 2008-09 academic year, enrollment increased 10 percent, 
jumping to 54,000 enrollees and 23,248 students in 4,663 courses.

“In 2009, despite the weak economy, adult education was one 
of the two industries that actually went up,” Extension Assistant 
Dean for External Affairs Henry DeVries said. “People want to 
bridge to new careers or new areas of employment that are in 

higher demand.”
In over 120 certificate programs, DeVries said students are able 

to explore specialized careers that UCSD curriculum often doesn’t 
cover, like copyediting, clinical trials and accounting. Upon com-
pleting a minimum of 20 units within one to two years, Extension 
students receive a certificate to verify their completion.

“[Students] apply for certificate programs to gain extra skills,” 
DeVries said. “For instance, you might have a background in busi-
ness or manufacturing, but not in biotechnology manufacturing. 
So, you might come to us to study for that, and then bridge to a 
career in that field.”

A growing number of partnerships between Extension and 
professional industries have made the school’s certificates widely 
respected within the San Diego business community, according to 
DeVries. Many companies actually send their employees to Exten-

FROM POLI. PROF. TO PROVOST
folk

L ast September, a new provost was appointed to Eleanor Roosevelt College. His name is Alan Houston, and he’s a political-science professor, 
award-winning scholar, father of two and die-hard fan 
of Stephen Colbert (sorry, Stewart-philes).

“I totally adore the Colbert Report,” Houston said. 
“Oh, yeah. He’s a genius.”

For the last two decades Houston has worked at all 
levels in the political-science department — from teach-
ing freshmen to advising graduate student dissertations. 
Before he came to UCSD, he taught at both Columbia 
University and Harvard University.

To top off his Ivy prestige, Houston snagged a few 
awards in the meantime.

His Harvard dissertation on revolutionary political 
writer Algernon Sidney was awarded the Leo Strauss 
Award in political philosophy from the American Politi-
cal Science Association in 1990. 

According to the new provost, one of his favorite 
jobs has been teaching undergraduates. 

“I’ve been teaching a freshman seminar at ERC that 
I taught in the fall, and am now continuing to teach,” 
Houston said. “And that’s one of the most electric and 
lively parts of my week. I totally enjoy that.”

Now that he’s stepped over to administration, Hous-
ton said his schedule has become much more hectic.

“A fair portion of my day is spent either meeting 
with individuals or with groups who are running the 
college… It’s meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings. 
There are faculty to meet with, and students to talk 
to, and I still have both undergraduate and graduate 
students I’m working with on projects — so it’s a busy 
full day.”

Despite the added workload, Houston said he 
already feels like part of the ERC community.

 “This is exactly where I want to be, doing what I 
want to do,” Houston said. “This is a very hard time for 
the UC system and for the colleges, but I’m happy to be 
here and to be a part of figuring out how to get through 
those problems.”

Houston said his top concern is dealing with the 
budget cuts, which — as students confront fee hikes and 
faculty are dealt furloughs — will make next year one of 
the most difficult in university history. 

“I know that maintaining the quality and integrity of 
undergraduate education is the most important thing I 
can do for students,” Houston said. “As the costs grow 

for students, we need to work very hard to ensure that 
the quality of their education — as well as services and 
resources offered — remain strong.”

In addition, by the end of his term as provost, Hous-
ton said he hopes to meet the oft-neglected needs of ERC 
transfer students. According to Houston, the founding 
model for UCSD was originally designed for freshmen, 
but the transfer-student population is increasing. 

“Transfer students are an important part of our stu-
dent body, and their needs and concerns are sometimes 
different from those of the four-year students,” Houston 
said. “I want to pay attention to that, and help our college 
create a fully integrated model for them.”

Another of his 
goals is establishing 
more intimate ties 
with the student body. 
Having attended a 
small liberal-arts 
college as an under-
graduate, Houston 
said he thrived on the 
personal interaction 
he experienced with 
his professors; in fact, 
it inspired him to 
pursue a career teach-
ing political science. 
Although such one-

on-one interaction is rarer at a large public university 
like UCSD, Houston said the university’s unique college 
system lets students feel more at home.

Within ERC, Houston said he’s committed to the 
college’s mission: enable students to live as globally 
minded as possible. 

 “I think it actually soaks in, and I think people really 
come to identity with MMW,” said Houston. “They end 
up thinking, ‘Hey, that was the coolest class.’” 

He said he wants to prepare students to succeed in 
a multicultural world that is not “defined narrowly by 
nations, states or single cultures.”

“The basic mission of ERC is clear, and doesn’t need 
to be tinkered with,” Houston said. “But allowing it to 
grow and thrive in this changing budget is going to be 
the biggest challenge.”

CLUBHOPPING

UCSD’s Fashion Quarterly claims to be the first fashion magazine on any UC cam-
pus  —although Cal’s BARE might 
protest. 

The student publication began 
in 2007 under the masthead Secret 
Scholar, but changed its name 
last year to more literal Fashion 
Quarterly (literal except for the fact 
that it’s released only twice a year); 
however, its motto has stayed the 
same: “Smart is sexy.”

“We didn’t want to follow the 
stereotypical ‘hot, sexy’ on the 
cover,” Fashion Quarterly co-editor 
Lois Lim said. “We wanted it to be 
known that you don’t have to be just 
smart or just sexy — you can have 
both.”

All of Fashion Quarterly’s cover 
girls are UCSD students, who un-
dergo a competitive casting process 
to get the gig — including an 
application asking for their GPA, 
major, extracurricular activities 
and hobbies, followed by in-person 
interviews. Once the cover girl is 
chosen, she’s given the VIP treat-
ment; dolled up by professional 
makeup artists and hair stylists, 
then given a scenic San Diego 
photo shoot.

“It’s really important that our 
cover models embody what smart 
and sexy is,” Lim said. “You want 
them to be a role model to everyone 
else. And they’ve never been able 
to be on the cover and do a photo 
shoot, so it helps their confidence 
as well.”

Every issue of Fashion Quarterly 
features the handiwork of two local 
fashion designers, including at least 
one student. Since its inception, the 
publication has formed ties with 
local stores, makeup artists, hair 
stylists and photographers — who 
all lend support during the produc-
tion process.

A grand total of 32 writers, 
designers, bloggers and publicists 
release approximately 25 Elle-
aspiring pages twice a year — on 
top of the requisite launch parties 
and quarterly events such as fashion 
shows, fundraisers and makeovers. 

“Fashion is so relatable,” Fashion 
Quarterly co-editor Liz Kim said. 
“Fashion is everywhere and touches 
so many people. I don’t think 
people realize how important it is. 
And there’s more to fashion than 
clothes.”

sion courses, all expenses paid.
“Of the Extension students we 

have, about half of them are sent by 
their company,” DeVries said. “If you 
think of all the major companies — 
Qualcomm, Sony, Sempra Energy, 
PG&E — all of those companies are 
sending their employees to us.”

After finding out about Exten-
sion classes through a co-worker, 
2009 Warren College graduate April 
Harter took seven Extension classes, 
four of which were completed for 
her certificate in sustainable business 
practices. She took advantage of a 
program for full-time UCSD students 
called LAUNCH, in which juniors and 
senior take Extension classes concur-
rently with their academic classes and 
meet with a career mentor quarterly to 
discuss their aspirations

“[Extension courses] were different 
than undergraduate classes because 
they were applied,” Harter said. “You 
could really do hands-on projects. 
We looked at case studies, worked in 
groups. We often had one or two large 
presentations to give in front of the 
class. So we really had to look at issues 
that we were discussing. And all of my 
courses — some were more in media, 
some in sustainability — headed back 
to the business curriculum.”

Small class sizes also allowed Har-
ter and Warren College Senior Dara 
Bu an opportunity to network with 
professors and business-professionals.

“[Extension professors] are 
actively working in the field,” Harter 
said. “They’re very connected in 
the community; they’re involved in 
other organizations. So they’re very 
knowledgeable about events happing 
in the community. Different Exten-
sion professors might suggest us to go 
to these events — whether it [would 
be] in a chamber or a professional 
organization. It brings us places that 
aren’t strictly academic, but more 
professional.”

Bu agreed, adding that the intimate 
environment made the experience of 
getting to know her professors less 
stressful than with university profes-
sors.

“I felt a lot less pressure in this 
course,” Bu said. “My professor even 
hooked me up with an opportunity to 

write for [San Diego News Network] 
and attend the [Public Relations 
Society of America] conference. I’ve 
already asked him for a letter of rec-
ommendation.”

Both Harter and Bu said they feel 
their time at Extension has given them 
a competitive edge in the workforce 
by adding extra skills to their resume. 
Harter, who now works as a director 
of social media for Scribe Commu-
nications, said earning her Extension 
certificate helped prepare her for the 
office environment.

“Having the certificate has defi-
nitely helped me understand some 
of the choices and practices that our 
clients are making,” Harter said. 

However, a recent uprising of 
unhappy web-design students cast a 
shadow on Extension’s reputation.

Last summer, Extension Digital 
Art Center graduate Kevin Root en-
rolled in a web-design class that would 
arouse controversy over Extension’s 
refund policy and its self-proclaimed 
commitment to serving the “critical 
lifelong knowledge and skill develop-
ment needs of individuals, organiza-
tions and the community.”

Last summer, 20 students signed a 
letter of complaint while 12 students, 
Root included, filed a formal grievance 
with the administration demanding a 
refund of a $6,750 enrollment fee. The 
students said they were demanding 
their money back because they felt 
the class had not adequately prepared 
them for a career in web design, as 
promised. 

The subjects of contention were 
instructors Harrison Watts who had 
left town for 20 days and attempted 
to teach the class via email and John 
Lane who allegedly relied on unclear, 
unconnected teaching methods.

In response, Extension gave the 
students three choices: accept nine 
prepaid units of Extension courses, 
three months of online training worth 
$75 or six Saturdays of class-time 
learning Flash design. 

“We listened to the students’ 
concerns about their lack of training 
and offered them opportunities for 
further education,” DeVries said in a 
Dec. 3 article in the Guardian. “The 
reparations the students were offered 
were very fair and reasonable.”

At that time, only seven of the 12 
students had accepted the university’s 
offer.

Root and a few others, however, 
said they refused the three options 
because they did not provide the same 
depth and amount of instruction for 
which they had originally paid. Cur-
rently, Root is looking into pursuing 
legal action.

“It’s pretty disappointing,” Root 
said. “I’m no closer to becoming a web 
designer than when I started Exten-
sion. I don’t really want to get burned 
again [by another program like Exten-
sion], so I’ll probably teach myself and 
hope I can figure it out along the way.”

Although Root found the Digital 
Art Center program disappointing, he 
said doesn’t necessarily have a nega-
tive opinion of the entire Extension 
program.

“I’m sure there are parts of Exten-
sion that are phenomenal, but I only 
know what I see,” Root said. “I prob-
ably would tell people [interested in 
Extension] to do a lot of research.”

Though Root and his peers were 
heavily dissatisfied with their instruc-
tion, he said getting to know his fellow 
classmates was the most rewarding 
aspect of his time at Extension.

“One shining part was that there 
were a lot of good people,” Root said. 
“Everyone in the class was really close, 
so we are really helpful with each 
other. My friend and I actually started 
our own little design firm.”

Because Harter and Bu were both 
UCSD undergraduate students when 
taking Extension courses, the division 
gave them a voucher for complimen-
tary enrollment. Worth $270, the 
voucher covers most, if not all, of the 
costs for one course. These vouchers 
are available at the Extension office 
every quarter to full-time UCSD 
students.

“LAUNCH is really a lot of bang 
for your buck,” Harter said. “The 
certificate programs are really reason-
able as well. It’s a lot cheaper than 
if a working adult wanted to do a 
certificate in the program. Some of my 
courses were worth $450, but I took 
four classes for $650.”

shots, and his 12 rebounds were a 
career high — the second double-
double of his career.

Less than a minute into the second 
half, the Tritons trailed the Coyotes 
42-31, but — thanks to a huge offen-
sive rebound by Hatch — they rallied 
to pull within a point to 67-68.

However, Hatch’s points were 
the Tritons’ last, and the 
Coyotes went on to secure 
the 76-67 win.

The Coyotes shot just 
under 45 percent in the 
game — hitting 26 of 58 
from the field — while 
the Tritons sank 21 of 47. 
UCSD won the rebound 
battle 34-25, but yielded 
18 Coyote points off turn-
overs. 

“We gave a tremendous 
effort out there tonight,” 
head coach Chris Carlos 
said in an interview with 
the athletic department. 
“I thought the crowd was 
outstanding and full of 
energy, and we played real-
ly hard in the second half. 
We didn’t get the result we were after 
obviously, but the effort was there.”

On Thursday, freshman guard 
Jake Tarabilda scored a season-high 
15 points to lead a tepid Triton 
offense against Cal Poly Pomona. The 
Broncos limited UCSD to shooting 
33 percent.

Tarabilda and senior guard Tyler 
Acevedo hit two three-pointers apiece 
to help the Tritons build an early lead. 
Trailing 15-13 with nine minutes in 
the half, the Tritons answered with a 
12-2 run over the next seven minutes, 
taking a 25-17 lead. Christian Hatch 
converted three free throws during 
the stretch, and Acevedo hit back-to-
back triples to pad the lead. 

Despite the Tritons’ late tear in the 
first half, Cal Poly Pomona imposed 
their game in the second half: The 

Broncos opened with a 22-9 run to 
take a 42-34 lead with six minutes 
remaining. The Tritons threatened 
a comeback by cutting to within six 
points, but the Broncos scored the 
next six to take their biggest lead of 
the game at 49-37, with one minute 
left. Cal Poly Pomona went on to seal 
a final score of 59-49. 

UCSD hit five of seven three-
pointers in the first half 
to take a 25-20 advan-
tage into the second, 
but the Pomona defense 
— best in the CCAA — 
stepped it up, outscoring 
the Tritons 39-24 in the 
game’s final 20 minutes. 

Tarabilda converted 
six of nine from the floor, 
three of which were tri-
ples. He also added four 
assists and two rebounds.

The Broncos entered 
the game with a league-
low 54.4 points per game. 
They held the Tritons to 
just 49 points, their low-
est output since scoring 
46 points in a 22-point 
loss against Cal Poly 

Pomona on Dec. 5.
In spite of last week’s difficulties, 

Tarabilda said he was encouraged by 
the team’s progress.

“It was just some of the little 
things we didn’t do, and some things 
that didn’t go our way, or else we 
could have had two wins this week,” 
Tarabilda said. “As a team, we are 
definitely more confident, and have 
realized if we play like that every game 
— with high intensity and an empha-
sis on the defensive end — we’re going 
to start winning some games.”

UCSD will complete the four-
game home stand against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Feb. 4 and Cal 
State Los Angeles on Feb. 6.

Tritons trailing 69-68, Carlisle drained a 
clutch shot from well behind the three-
point line to give UCSD the lead. The 
Tritons stopped Pomona on the final 
possession and hung on for the win.

“When we got down by 11, they 
began talking about getting stops and 
just kept fighting,” head coach Charity 
Elliot said. “That was one of the crazi-
est endings I’ve ever been a part of, 
and showed again how much fight this 
team has.”  

In Saturday’s Spirit Night game, the 
Tritons played tremendous defense to 
shut down San Bernardino, winning 
58-41 to a record women’s-basketball 
crowd of 2,020. UCSD was dominant 
from the start, and never conceded the 
lead after the first three minutes.

Game standout Tiffany Hunter 
scored a career-high 23 points and 
added 13 rebounds to complete the 
double-double. 

Aggressive defense on both sides 
characterized the first half, and the 
Coyotes held the Tritons to a low 27 
points. However, up to the challenge, 
UCSD allowed San Bernardino only 23 
first-half points, and took a four-point 
lead into the break.

The Tritons kept up the defensive 
intensity in the second half, keeping the 
Coyotes to 23 percent from the field.

“Even though we held them to 23 
points in the first half, I wasn’t very 
pleased with our defensive intensity,” 
said Elliot. “At halftime, I really chal-
lenged them to raise the level on the 
defensive end, and I thought the sec-
ond half was some of the best team 
defense we’ve played.”

The Tritons also out-rebound-
ed  San Bernardino 46-30, thanks 
to Hunter’s 13 — and eight more by 
freshman guard Emily Osga.

UCSD was given an extra boost 
by the return of junior center Charity 
Smith, who played in her first game 
since Jan. 3. She contributed seven 
points and grabbed three rebounds in 
nine minutes on the court.

The Tritons were also energized by 
the roar of the crowd, much larger than 
usual due to the Spirit Night draw.

“I think that the energy from my 
team and the crowd led the team and 
I to have such a great performance,” 
said Hunter. “We fed off of the crowd, 
and it kept the game at a very intensi-
fied level.”

The wins brought UCSD to 17-1 
overall and 12-1 in conference play. 
The Tritons will shoot for another 
home victory at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, 
when they play Cal State Dominguez 
Hills at RIMAC arena.

The Tritons were looking for-ward to playing on their home court after a difficult road trip 
the weekend before last.

They began a four-game home 
stand last week when they hosted Cal 
Poly Pomona on Jan. 28 and Cal State 
San Bernardino on Jan. 30. (The next 
two games will be Feb. 4 and Feb. 6). 
Pomona’s defense made the difference 
on Thursday, limiting the Tritons to 
just 49 points in a 59-49 victory.

Again on Saturday, as 3,860 fans 
packed into RIMAC Arena for Spirit 
Night, the Tritons couldn’t upset the 
Coyotes — now 13-4, 11-2 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play. 
A tight game ended in a nine-point 
deficit for UCSD, as Cal State San 
Bernardino won the game 76-67. The 
Tritons are now 4-12, 3-10 in CCAA.

“San Bernardino and Pomona are 
two of the best teams in our confer-
ence,” freshman guard Jake Tarabilda 
said. “We are bummed about the loss-
es, because we were right there with 
both games, but if we play how we did 
this week, then we are definitely going 
to get some wins this second half of 
conference play.”

The Tritons couldn’t catch up to 
the Coyotes, despite senior guard 
Jordan Lawley’s career-high 32 points 
— topping a previous best of 31 
points, set against San Francisco State 
on Jan. 16 — and a double-double by 
sophomore center Christian Hatch.

Lawley made eight of 16 shots 
from the floor, sinking three of four 
outside the arch. Twenty-four of his 
32 shots came in the second half, and 
he tallied 22 of UCSD’s 25 points in 
the first.

After slipping three spots to No. 10 in the Division-II national rankings, the UCSD women’s 
basketball team came up with two huge 
wins last week at RIMAC Arena.

The Tritons defeated Cal Poly 
Pomona on Thursday, Jan. 28 by a 
score of 71-69 after a clutch final-
minute shot. The following Saturday, 
an excellent Triton defense dominated 
Cal State San Bernardino for a 58-41 
win on UCSD’s annual Spirit Night.

The women went down to the 
wire with Pomona, requiring late-
game heroics from sophomore guard 
Chelsea Carlisle. Carlisle scored 22 
points on eight-of-16 shooting, and 
had four assists and three steals — 
all team highs. Junior Tiffany Hunter 
added 17 points and eight rebounds to 
the Triton effort.

The Broncos came out fast, trying 
to push the tempo of the game, jump-
ing to a 22-14 lead midway through the 
first half. However, the Tritons rallied 
to keep the game tight: Neither team 
was able to take more than an eight-
point advantage.

Going into halftime, UCSD took 
a narrow 36-35 lead, after a pull-up 
jumper from senior guard Annette Ilg 
closed out the first half. 

Pomona rushed head first into the 
second half, successfully feeding the 
ball into the low post to go on a quick 
8-2 run. The Broncos were physically 
dominant — 40 points in the paint 
with a plus-11 rebounding margin — 
and extended their lead to as much as 
11 with 9:07 on the clock.

But the Tritons rallied once again, 
thanks mostly to Carlisle and Hunter, 
who scored 18 of the final 22 points. 
With 25 seconds remaining and the
