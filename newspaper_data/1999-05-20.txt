BERKELEY - Two 
employees of the Blue 
Heaven drugstore on 
Telegraph Avenue were 
arrested last Friday, accused 
of selling an over-the-counter 
drug with the knowledge that 
their customers intended to 
use it to make methampheta-
mine. The suspects allegedly 
sold 98,000 pseudoephedrine 
pills to undercover agents. 
Officials said that up to nine 
pounds of methamphetamine 
could be produced from the 
amount of pseudoephedrine 
that was purchased by the 
agents. The pair will appear 
in federal court in Oakland 
on May 28. If found guilty, 
they could face up to 20 
years in prison, as well as 
fines of up to $250,000.

Child Receives Transplant 
HEALTH: Surgery was 
the first pediatric liver 
transplant south of L.A. 
By SheIIe MdM 
Guardian Reporter 

Eighteen-month-old Karla 
Ortega is lilted in pod condi-
tion after ........ a liver 
II'lnIpIIiIl a. May 6. Ortega's 

I~ •• upncy procedure 
wu .... fint pediatric liver 
IIIIIIpIInt from a living donor to 
lib place south of Los Angeles. 

Doctors at the UCSD 
Tnnsplant Center performed the 
transplant after Ortega was 
admitted to the UCSD Medical 

Cent~r in Hillcrest on April 30. 
Ortega's father, Carlos Brito 

Aranda, donated part of his liver 
because physicians felt they 
could not wait for a donor liver 
to become available. Doctors 
transplanted Aranda's left lateral 

lobe into Ortega. The left lateral 
lobe made up 15 percent of his 
liver. 

Kate Deely, a spokeswoman 
from UCSD HeaJthcare, said 
Aranda Via reIeaed from the 
hospital 011 May 13 and is feel-
inlwelJ. 

Deely uid the physicians and 
surpons involved in the proce-
dure donated their services and, 
due to the emergency nature of 
the case, the hospital c:ov~ the 
cost of the operation. 

UCSD Director of 
Abdominal Transplantation 
Marquis Hart said although the 
surgery was a delicate proce-
dure, doctors are confident that 
it went well. 

"A liver transplant is a very 
delicate, lengthy and complex 
procedure," Hart said. 'The fact 
that this kind of procedure 
involves major surgery on a 
healthy donor, and a tiny, criti-

'cally ill recipient, brings this to a 
new level of complexity. Even 
so, both procedures went very 
smoothly." 

Deely said doctors report a 
perfect course of recovery for both 
patients and Ortega will soon be 
released from the hospital. 

"We are extremely pleased 
with everything about this case," 
Ajai Khanna, UCSD's director 
of pediatric liver transplantation, 
said. "Both patients are doing 
very well and the initial function 
of the baby's new liver looks 
excellent." 

Prior to her transplant, Joel 
Lavine, UCSD's director of 
pediatric hepatololgy, diagnosed 
Ortega with rapid onset of liver 
failure of an unknown cause. 
Lavine said Ortega's blood was 
not clotting and she also had 
extreme jaundice. He also found 
that only 10 percent of her liver 
was functioning.

A.S. Council 
Approves 
New Budget 
FINANCE: Members 
decided last night how to 
spend student fees next year 
By VIncent Gragnanl . 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council spent almost two 
hours last night debating how to allocate 
the approximately $1 million that will be 
collected in student fees next year. 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar and Vice 
President Finance Eric Rovner prepared 
the 1999-2000 fiscal year budget, which 
the budget committee spent almost six 
hours Monday and Tuesday debating in 
order to make a recommendation to the 
A.S. Council. 

The budget includes $8,000 for a 
Triton Taxi Service that will offer stu-
dents rides on Friday and Saturday nights 
from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. in an area encom-
passing Pacific Beach, Del Mar and Mira 
Mesa. 

The $8,000 set aside in the executive. 
budget is unallocated, which means it 
can only be made available after the 
council has approved a contract with taxi 
service. Khullar said he hopes the A.S. 
Council will approve a contract before 
the end of this academic year so that the 
service can be available to students at the 
beginning of next year. 

Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
Andrea Mendez raised an objection to 
setting aside money for the program. She 
said that after speaking to the Student 
Safety and Awareness office, she felt that 
the program was not thorouglily 
researched. 

Khullar said that because it is an unal-
located item, he thinks the council should 
discuss details of the service when the 
A.S. Council decides whether to approve 
a contract. 

The motion to approve setting aside 
money for the Triton Taxi program 
approved with 13 members approving, 
one opposed and six abstaining.

'Two UCSD Students Injured in Car Accident 
CRASH: Lucio Vazquez and Bethany Netro were hit at intersection as they were walking to concert on Friday night 
By Jennifer GfIIdy 
Stsff Writer 

UCSD Police stated that at 
approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday 
evening, a car hit two UCSD stu-
dents on their way to the Sun God 
Festival concert. Bethany Netro, 
21, and Lucio Vazquez, 22, were 
injured at the intersection of North 
Torrey Pines Road and La Jolla 

Shores Drive. 
Netro and Vazquez, along with 

friends Unni Malancharuvil and 
Michael Foley, ' were heading 
toward campus from University 
Lutheran Church on La lolla 
Shores Drive. As the group began 
to cross the street, Netro and 
Vazquez were only five feet from 
the curb when a car hit them. 

Netro landed close to the north 
crosswalk. Vazquez landed close to 
the scene of the accident. 
Eyewitnesses called the paramedics, 
and Netro and Vazquez were rushed 
to Scripps Memorial Hospital. 

Vazquez, who regained con-
sciousness Tuesday, suffered from 
multiple head fractures, two 
cracked vertebrae and a broken 

pelvis. On Tuesday, he was moved 
out of the intensive care unit 

Netro, who is in serious condi-
tion, suffered from a broken tibia 
and fibula in her leg. She has 
undergone two of three surgeries, 
one for internal bleeding, and 
another on her leg. She has also had 
multiple blood transfusions for her 
severe loss of blood.

Fire Damages A.S. Office 
- ern (TI) TIll 
lrafflc School To Go~ BLAZE: Cause of flames 

is unknown but being 
calJed suspicious 
By VIncent 0,.,....,1 
Senior Staff Writer 

A fire that began in a paper 
recycling container burned parts of . 
the third Door of the Price Center . 
last Thursday night shortly after 9 
p.m. causing $2,000 to $3,000 
damage, Assistant Fire Marshal 
Don Anderson said. 

Anderson added that while the 
cause of the fire is officially 
unknown, it may be of suspicious 
origin. 

"We hope that it wasn't suspi-
cious," Anderson said. " We would 
rather say it was an undetermined 
cause and that it was accidental." 

Anderson said that repair work 
is currently being done to replace 
the ceiling tiles and the carpeting 
and to repaint the room. 

Anderson said that shortly after 

DECISION: 
Money for Triton Taxi 
approved by council 
ContInued ".. ..... 1 

The council also discussed the 
fees it pays to the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA). Every quarter, UCSD 
pays money to UCSA to act as the 
official lobbying voice for UC stu-
dents. In the budget, UCSA fund-
ing is unallocated. By not allocat-
ing the money at this point, A.S. 
Council would then decide each 
quarter whether they wanted to 
fund UCSA. The finance commit-
tee unanimously approved the 
item. 

During council debate, howev-
er, council members objected to the 
passage of the item. The council 
members decided to discuss the 
item. 

Khullar said it was important to 
fund UCSA on a quarterly basis so 
that the organization remains 
accountable to UCSD students. 

"Everyone we give money to 
needs to be accountable to UCSD," 
Khullar said. 'This puts the respon-
sibility in your hands. The money

the fire started, a student entered 
the building and smelled smoke. 
She walked through the building to 
investigate and when she saw the 
tire, she rang the fire alarm. 

Anderson said that because the_ 
fire was caught so soon, the sprin-
klers did not go off, saving the build-
ing from extensive water damage. 

" If it hadn' t been for her we 
would have had a real problem," 
Anderson said. "They are lucky it 
didn't get any worse. Another 
minute and it would have set the 
sprinkler head off." 

Anderson added that shortly 
before the fire department arrived, 
a staff member put most of the fire 
out with a fire extinguisher. 

Director of Student Affairs and 
the University Centers Jim 
Carruthers said Tuesday that 
although he did not know how 
much the repair work would cost, 
Anderson 's estimate of $2,000 to 
$3,()()() sounded accurate. He said 
that a university insurance policy 

is there. It is for UCSA, you just 
have to approve the release of the 
funds." 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Rosaline Chan said she 
felt UCSA can be held accountable 
by other means. 

" I feel there are other ways to 
hold them accountable without 
holding money over their head," 
Chan said. "To end an organiza-
tion 's financial stability for me is 
not the only way to go." 

Marshall Sophomore Senator 
Jeffrey Dodge said he supported 
an amendment to the item which 
would allocate funds to UCSA 
bUI sti 11 carry out a quarterly 
review. 

Instead of setting aside money 
for future allocation as was pro-
posed in the original budget, 
Roosevelt Freshman Senator 
Jessica Williams proposed an 
amendment to allocate the funding 
to UCSA. Her amel\dment passed 
with 15 members approving, four 
opposed and three abstaining. The 
item as a whole passed with 16 
members approving, three opposed 
and two abstaining. 

The point that drew the most 
debate in the finance committee 

would cover the majority of the 
costs. 

Carruthers said that the majority 
of the repair work is complete but 
that the carpet still needs to be I 
replaced. He said he expects the 
room to be back to normal in about 
10 days. 

When asked about increased 
ecurity for the area, Carruthers 

said that the area is for students 
and should remain accessible to 
the students using it. He added 
that he would only consider 
increased security if the students 
wanted it. 

Since the fire, a lock was added 
to the doors of the Senate 
Chambers where the fire occurred. 
A .S. Advisor Paul DeWine said the 
decision to add a lock on the door 
was made by a consensus of staff 
members and students. DeWine 
added that because it is a combina-
tion lock. students on the A .S. 
Council will have access to the 
area. 

meetings was the proposed 
$23,320 allocated in the original 
budget to Student Cable Works 

. (SCW). Graham Beck, general 
manager for SCW said that 
although they would like to fund 
part of their service through corpo-
rate advertising, or underwriting, 
members do not have the time to 
gather such funds. 

In order to help SCW become 
~ore self-sufficient, the budget 
committee decided to spend $750 
to fund a business manager that 
could look (or other sources of 
funding. The budget committee 
deducted that $750 from other 
areas of the SCW operating bud-
gel. 

Financial Controller Genoa 
Ferguson said SCW will conti nue 
to depend on A .S. for funding 
unless they are forced to find their 
own money. 

"They just want to keep using 
the A.S. ATM machine," Ferguson 
aid. 'This has gone on for a very 

long time. It 's not that I don't sup-
port SCW but the money that we' re 
allocating them is a large sum 
every year. What I'd like to see 
happen is a slow weaning of 
SCW."

Judy Sweet's Enthusiastic 
Leadership Will Be Missed 

Please, at least two more years , Judy Sweet. Two 
more years . 

We want you here for Division II . After all, it was 
you that made this all possible. Thanks to your 
drive, your spirit, your dedication, we Tritons are 
finally going big time. We are finally going to 
Division II. 

Beginning fall quarter 2000, the UCSD Tritons 
will be Division III no longer. We will be moving on 
up to bigger and brighter things: namely, Division n 
competition. And Judy Sweet is the reason why. 

Since.1975, when Sweet took control of UCSD ath-
letics, this campus has seen an ever-growing enthusi-
asm and support for Triton sports. When Sweet's 
tenure at UCSD began, the Tritons had a small and 
noncompetitive program. Now, we are an impenetra-
ble juggernaut. We are the Sears Cup.champions. 

In total, Sweet has been at the helm for all of 
UCSD's 24 National Championships, 31 runner-up 
trophies and 30 third-place national finishes. 
During her tenure, Sweet was also an advocate and 
planner for UCSD's athletic facilities, which are 
viewed among the nation's best. Not bad for 24 
years of work. 

The Guardian salutes Sweet not just for her work 
as a Triton, but also for her commitment to improve

OBS.ESSIVE FANS FAWN OVER' 
NEW 'STAR WARS' EPISODE 

COMMENTARY: 
Fanatics of the prequel 
resemble cult members 
praying to their deity 
By Kevin Seld 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

The opening of "Star Wars: 
Episode I - The Phantom Menace" 
this week is the climax of an obsession 
that has gripped the nation and the 
entire world. 

The hoopla surrounding the new 
"Star Wars" movie is outrageous, 

The maniacal behavior of "Star 
Wars" fans has reached disturbing pro-
portions. They literally live and 
breathe "Star Wars." . 

Many toys, posters, books and 
other "Star Wars" items have been col-
lected by obsessed fans and stored 
around their homes and offices. They 
have seen the original three movies 
repeatedly and can probably recite 
every line. They may be your class-
mates, your roommates or even your 
professor. 

Whoever they may be, they are not 
normal people. Rather, they are sick 
individuals whose lives revolve 
around a mere movie. 

It is amazi ng to see how far these 
obsessed "Star Wars" followers will 
go. They behave like they belong to a 
huge, weird religious cult - the "Star 
Wars" cult. 

The beliefs held by the followers of 
a cult control and engulf their lives and 
behavior. The cult 's millions of fol-
lowers waste valuable time and money 
doing practically anything to partake 
in any new "Star Wars" experience, no 
matter how absurd. 

Some have quit their jobs or called 
in sick just to be a part of the phenom-
enon. They have waited endlessly in 
long lines instead of doing something 
con tructi ve. 

Any normal person would never go

followers will go. The,

the 'Star Wars' cult. 
to the theaters just to see the previews. 
Yet this is exactly what these fanatics 
did when the first movie trailer for 
"The Phantom Menace" appeared in 
cinemas back in November. 

Fans made pilgrimages to theaters 
across the country, paying the full 
price of a ticket just to see the two-
minute preview. After they viewed and 
applauded the footage, most of them 
walked out before the main feature 
began. Variety reported that at a the-
ater in Los Angeles, about two-thirds 
of the 500 people in the audience 
walked out before 'The Siege" started 

to roll on the screen. 
The money for admission alone 

could have been better spent on 
something else, like food or clothing. 
These people could have seen the 
trailer for free when it was broadcast-
ed all over the Internet and on numer-
ous television news programs only 
hours after it was available in the-
aters. 

"Star Wars" fanatics were com-
pelled by their obsession to see the 
preview immediately. And once the 
trailer ended, it was a signal for them 
to make a major exodus from their 
sacred place of worship. 

Then, there was the strange behav-
ior on May 3, when merchandise and 
toys for the new movie became avail-
able to the public for the first time. 
Fans and toy collectors waited in long 
lines at stores across the country, hop-
ing to be the first to grab the new "Star 
Wars" idols. 

Once the doors opened at midnight. 
these nutty fans rushed into the stores 
like a pack of wolves pouncing on its 
prey, grabbing as many products as 
possible. 

Most of the obsessed and anxious 
fans participating in the toy frenzy 
were adults. 

It is bad enough for children to act 
this way, obsessively craving for 'a 
specific toy and then getting ecstatic 
when they finally have it in their 
greedy little hands, but adults partici-
pating in this type of behavior look 
ridiculous. Especially when these toys 
were primarily designed for children. 
It is as though the obsession that 
stemmed from their beliefs controlled 
them to act in this abnormal, childlike 
behavior. 

Then, the obsession extended to 
fans' desire to have a movie ticket for 
opening day. Across' the country, many 
fans began to resemble Islamic 
nomad& on their religioul pilgrimage

OPINION 5 

USE CAUTION WITH MEHAN OBSESSED: 'Star Wars' fever 
infects the world 

planned to migrate to the United 
States, so that they will be here on 
opening day. This is because stu-
dios generally release movies in 
the United States and Canada 
weeks before they open in other 
countries. 

Editor: 
This is in response to a recent 

article concerning Professor Hugh 
''Bud'' Mehan being appointed to 
the helm of our campus early acad-
emic outreach services 
("C.R.E.A.T.E. Director 
Appointed," May 10). 

I caution those who will deal 
with Mehan, for he is the poorest 
of choices for such as important 
position which impacts so directly 
upon minority students. He has a 
track record of participating in 
politically and racially sensitive 
arenas for his own personal gain 
within the university community 
here. 

He is definitively a champion of 
censorship and denial of constitu-
tional due process for anyone who 
offers a substantive challenge to his 
acts of racial preference. 

I have had powerful personal 
dealings with the professor, and 
from firsthand experience I wish to 
throw up a red flag. I caution that 
Mehan deals unfairly when he is 
cornered politically. Be alert to 
those powers you dare delegate to 
him. Thank you.

indications that graduate students 
feel the need for a more active and 
substantial voice, as well as an 
indication that the administration 
disagrees with .the validity of this 
request. 

The administration's position 
seems to be: We've worked hard to 
give you a good deal, so what are 
you worried about? To which the 
graduate students seem to be reply-
ing: We are worried that no system 
is in place that assures the protec-
tion of that deal or gives us an offi-
cial voice in its negotiation. 

The administration's recent 
anti-union propaganda questions 
whether unionization is the most 
effective way to ensure such a 
"voice." Even if the administra-
tion's flurry of c-mails and hard-
copy union-phobia was convinc-
ing, no alternative has been offered 
to ensure the protection of TAs' 
rights of negotiation. 

Administrative foot-dragging is 
the order of the day when it comes 
to finding solutions, while there 
seems to be plenty of energy to 
fight against the one solution put 
forth by graduate students. 

What we learn from this is that 
the administration is capable of 
being highly motivated, but not in 
the service of student rights -
even if we shout really loudly: 
"Hey! This is important to us!" 

The administralion has access to 
resources and capital to support its 
positions, while students have, 
prior to unionization, had no such

they pitched tents near movie the-
aters. Some have been camping 
out for weeks. 

When tickets finally went on 
sale last week, long lines took 
over city blocks, as fans wanted 
to be the first to get tickets. 
Many of them dressed up in their 
silly cult attire, known to the sec-
ular world as homemade "Star 
Wars" costumes. They dressed 
up as ledi knights and wielded 
their light sabers. Others bro~ht 
toys, books and other paraphcr-
nalia. 

Those who purchased their 
tickets . for the very first , 
Wednesday showing at 12:0 I 
a.m. prominently displayed their 
'1ewels" to other fans and the 
media as if they were holding 
some sacred, divine items. 

The frenzy to get tickets for 
opening day was not only appar-
ent at cinemas. Millions of fans 
trying to buy tic~ets via movie-
fone.com were shut out because 
too many tried to log on at the 
same time. 

Afterward, tickets were being 
auctioned all over the place, 
including the popular eBay web 
site. Many were paying as much 
as $600 for a pair of opening-day 
tickets. 

The obsession to see this 
movie on opening day is not just 
confined· to the United States. 
Fans from other countries have 

Of course, a high-profile reli-
gious cult is not complete without 
the extensive media coverage to 
document its weird and strange 
behavior. 

Many magazines, newspapers 
and web sites have run stories on 
the conduct of "Star Wars" fans 
waiting in long lines, hungry for 
opening tickets or new merchan-
dise. 

Numerous television and radio 
programs across the country were 
on hand to cover the frenzy. Fans 
have even talked to the media 
about the first time they saw the 
"Star Wars" trilogy as if it was a 
significant religious experience. 
Even the Guardian is guilty of 
running articles on this ridiculous 
behavior. 

Sadly, this madness will defi-
nitely continue when episodes II 
and III are released. 

Episode II is tentatively 
scheduled to open in about 2002 
and episode III will probably be 
released around 2005. 

. Once again, the same "Star 
Wars" fanatics will be camping 
outside theatres dressed in their 
ridiculous "Star Wars" gear, play-
ing with their "Star Wars" para-
phernalia, telling their annoying 
"Star Wars" stories and wasting 
away their precious lives. 

Lucas has publicly said that 
episode III will be the last "Star

CATHY 
RAZIL 

This past Sunday, the descen-
dants of Thomas Jefferson gathered 
together to hold their 86th annual 
luncheon. 

Normally, this event would pro-
voke the same sort of reaction it 
had for the past 85 years: That 
is, anyone not actually belong-
ing to the Monticello 
Association could care less 
when, where or how these peo-
ple held their family reunion. 

However, this year 's luncheon 
looked to get a lot more interesting 
alier a scientific study concluded last 
fall that President Jefferson had 
fathered at least one child with one 
of hi slaves, Sally Hemings. 

Turns out that good 01' Jefferson 
may have written about equality and 
all that other nice stuff, but idealism 
evidently didn 't work out so well in 
real life. He used slave labor to work 
on his Monticello estate and evident-
ly also took Hemings as a mistress. 

This information wasn't nearly 
as unexpected to the rest of the pop-
ulation as it seemed to be to the 
Monticello Association. While 

. some of their members appeared to 
be shocked to hear about their fore-
father's behavior, I think most of us 
in the real world pretty much 
expeCted this sort of thing. 

Female slaves were often taken 
advantage of sexually by their mas-
ters; as much as t would like to 
think that Thomas Jefferson would 
be above that sort of thing (and the 
; Iave ownership), he announce-
ment that he fathered Eston 
Hemings didn 't exactly throw me

So the right thing for the 

Monticello Association Lo do 
would be to immediately induct all 
of the Hemings descendants into 
the family circle. Right? Urn, not 
so fast. It seems that the all white 
association isn ' t about to rush into 
officially recognizing the mostly 
African American Heming 
descendants. The members did 
generously allow the Hemings 

sure as hell weren't going to grant 
them automatic membership into 
their family group. 

But then, maybe I'm being a lit-
tle hard on the assOciation members. 
After all, it took a lot of hard work, 
skill and perseverance for them to 
have been born Jefferson descen-
dants. It certainly couldn't have 
been just luck or random chance. So 
one can hardly blame them if they 
want to be a linle wary of recogniz-

ing African Americans who just 
happened to prove that they also 
had Jefferson as an ancestor. 

If they let in the Hemings 
descendants, then they'd have 

group to attend Sunday's luncheon 
as guests, but they barely got the 
chance to finish eating before some 
members were attempting to eject 
them so the association could dis-
cuss "family business." 

Family business? What on earth 
could be so private that the 
Hemings descendants would be 
forced to leave the room? Perhaps 
they were planning on discussing 
exactly what shade of red 
Jefferson's hair really was, whether 
Monticello should be repainted that 
year, or maybe even (gasp!) 
whether or not to have chicken or 
fish at next year's get-together. 

"Family business" was basically 
a lame excuse to get the Hemings 
descendants out of the room so the 
people who didn't want them there 
could speak loudly and freely 
against their ever being officially 
recognized by 'the association. 

The motion to eject them failed, 
33 to 20, but the message was defi-
nitely clear. The others didn't want 
the Hemings descendants there, 
even if DNA testing had proven 
their Jefferson lineage. And they 

to include just about anyone 
who could prove that they descend-
ed from Jefferson. Yup, it sure 
would be a horrific tum of events if 
they started including aLL Jefferson 
descendants into the Monticello 
Association. 

Unfonunately, the Monticello 
Association seems to find it 
extremely distressing that their 
family tree could also include an 
African American branch. The 
members' treatmen~ of the 
Hemings descendants made it clear 
that they were not entirely wel-
come, even though they were just 
as much descendants of Jefferson 
as the white folk. 

The association might try to justi-
fy its actions by explaining that they 
are being cautious about including 
new members, but I can't help but 
feel that if the Hemings descendants 
were white, none of these delays 
would ever have happened. 

I guess that even in our enlight-
ened age, it still takes more than a 
shared forefather for many to accept 
minorities as equals and family.

Tired of shouting with nothing 
to show for it but sore throats, TAs 
are trying to get some clout behind 
them. If a union is in UCSD TAs' 
future, .then, the administration 
can cry in its own soup. 

Since TAs and the administra-
tion are in a mutually beneficial 
relationship, it is reasonable (not 
to mention fair) that both parties 
should be afforded significant 
input into the negotiation of their 
needs. 

There is no reason to assume 
that a union would be more or less 
adversarial than the administra-
tion, or that it would be any less 
capable of good-faith negotiation 
than the students representing 
themselves in any other way, is

GenetIc EngI ....... ng 
Will Make ute Better 
Editor: 

I would like to respond to 
Shannon Castle's article 
("Cloning and Genetic 
Engineering Have No Apparent 
Benefits." May 10) because I 
think that she underestimates the 
benefits and overestimates the 
costs of genetic engineering. 

First, Castle underestimates the 
potential benefits of genetic engi-
neering. 

Genetic engineering would 
allow us to prevent genetically 
transmitted diseases and thus pre-
vent a lot of suffering. Further, 
genetic engineering would allow 
us not only to prevent negatives, 
but actually to create positives. 

We could alter people so that 
they could be stronger, smarter 
and thus, have a greater potential 
for success and happiness in life. 

Like all scientific knowledge, 
knowledge of genetics gives us the 
power to do so much good in fur-
thering human happiness on earth. 
Of course, with this power comes 
the potential for abuse. 

However, second, I think that 
Castle overestimates the risks and 
costs of genetic engineering. She 
seems to have two main worries: 
that the good guys will make mis-
takes and that the bad guys will get 
their hands on the knowledge and 
use the power for destructive pur-
poses. 

In regard to the first, she wor-
ries that we will alter the gene pool 
in a way that will reduce diversity 
and have bad consequences on the 
adaptation and survival of the 
human species. 

In regard to the second, she 
worries that people will attempt 
to create a perfect race and that 
this will reduce diversity, with 
the dangers above mentioned, as 
well as lead to the unfair treat-
ment and discrimination against 
those who do not fit the prefect 
mold. 

I think that the bigger worry 
under the category of bad guys 
abusing the knowledge is that this 
kind of technology could fall into 

Lecture Meetings: 41 

Houn per Subject: 

the hands of it powerful dictator 
who might force it on his popula-
tion, violating their rights to their 
own lives, for his own purposes 
(such as military conquest of the 
world). 

However, both of these worries 
are not new to genetic engineer-
ing, but go along with any advance 
in scientific knowledge with tech-
nological implications. There is 
always the danger that even those 
with good intentions will, through 
ignorance, create unforeseen cir-
cumstances that are bad for human 
life. And there is always the dan-
ger that those with bad intentions 
will get their hands on powerful 
knowledge and use it for destruc-
tive ends. 

In the end though it is knowl-
edge, and the power that it brings, 
that enables us to reshape the 
physical and mental world for the 
furtherance of human flourishing 
here on eanh. By focusing too 
much on the costs and potential 
dangers, which we of course 
should pay careful attention to, we 
deprive ourselves of the potential 
benefits that could make human 
life so much better.

Wars" movie. 

In the Jan. 12, 1999 issue of 
Vanity Fair magazine, he said that 
he really never intended to make 
nine "Star Wars" movies. This sur-
prised many people who remem-
ber Lucas proclaiming that it was 
supposed to be a nine-part series 
when the first movie came out in 
1977. 

When die hard fans learned of 
this revelation, they were out-
raged. Many of them expressed 
their resentment and anger 
toward Lucas on various chat 
rooms and bulletins boards on the 
Internet. 

These obsessed followers 
behaved as if the lord and deity of 
their religious cult had betrayed

Despite 
fire alarms and 

'cold weathet; 
this year)s 

'Third Annual 
Gleib Show) 

demonstrated the 
talent of the 

production staff 
and of 

Gleiberman 
himself 

••• 
s the biggest, most celebrated and most planned 
event at UCSD, students expect our traditional Sun 
God Festival to begin with a blast each year, and last 
Thursday night was no exception. The show was so 
hot this year, they were on fire, literally. Two-thirds 
of the way through the show there was a fire in the 
A.S . offices, setting off an obnoxious fire alarm and 
attracting three fire trucks. 

However, none of this fazed the highly profes-
sional "Gleib Show" staff, or the host himself, Muir 

Junior Ben Gleiberman. He used his quick wit and healthy ego to 
keep the show running smoothly. 

The show took place in the middle of the Price Center, having out-
grown the Muir Quad which was used for the two previous live "Gleib 
Shows" in conjunction with the Sun God Festival. The spectacular 
opener, where the "Gleib Show" staff actually convinced the U.S. 
Marines to carry Gleibennan to his show in a tank, demonstrated how 
carefully planned and professionally executed the entire show was. 

The show featured former MTV Veejay Kennedy, who has a new 
book out tilled, Hey Ladies! Tales and TIps for Curious Girls. 
Kennedy also 'currently hosts her own radio show in Seattle. Known 
for her rowdy sense of humor and her strong personality, Kennedy 
delighted the crowd with her humor and spunk. She began with a 
great rendition of the Marine's fight song, saluting their efforts to get 
Gleiberman to his show 011 time, and used her wit to spar with Gleib 
himself. Later she "complemented" Gleiberman by calling him the 
"male Jenny McCarthy." 

Previous guests to the live "Gleib Show" have included Chancel-
lor Dynes and Dustin Diamond (aka. Screech from "Saved By the 
Bell.") ApparenLly, last year Screech didn't impress the crown too 
much, and six years ago Kennedy went on a blind date with Diamond, 
so Gleiberman and Kennedy were able to connect on their mutual dis-
like for the guy, much to the audiences amusement. 

Also featured this year was comedian Carlos Oscar who has per-
formed on the' "Tonight Show." Oscar made the immediate connec-
tion, (or separation) between UCSD and SDSU, and had everyone 
laughing out loud at his comparison between our Sun God Festival 
and SDSU's average Thursday night. 

The house band was Greensboro Lane, and it had fans dancing in 
the aisles before the show even started. The four members, some trav-
eling down from Los Angeles, opened the show, and played through-
out the show, even interacting with Gleiberman when the occasion 
called for it. Greensboro Lane is experienced at this gig, having 
played the two previous live shows. This is the first year, however, 
that it has regularly played the regular "G1eib Show" on Muir TV. 

The show also featured a mini-feature film titled "U.C. Swingers." 
Previously the live "G1eib Show" has shown, "Jewish Maguire" and 
"Titanic II." This year, the movie could have been a lillie shorter, but 
it was well done. 

Gleiberman himself was impressive. The show was professionally 
organized, arid it was obvious that no one cared as much or worked as 
hard as Gleib himself. There were other people whose efforts were 
extraordinary as well and they include Jason Adelman who performed 
in the featured spoof, "U.c. Swingers," and Jill Lucks who has been 
a writer on the show since its induction in 1996. 

"I love doing the show, but a lot of it has to do with those I work 
with," said Gleiberman. "Without their help, the show would not be 
such a success." 

As a student-run production that took place outside and live, the 
show was great. The only complaints from the audience were due to 
the cold and the fire alarm. The other problem seemed to come from 
the length of the show that could probably be attributed to. the length 
of the previously taped films that were incorporated into the otherwise 
"live" show. 

The live "Gleib Show" will be run on campus cable on June I, at 
11 :00 p.m. The "Gleib Show" is regularly aired on Muir TV every 
Monday at 10 p.m. and Friday at 6 p:m.

The UCSD Guardian HIATUS 9 

ONE TAKE ON THE BEST OF THE '90S 
Here are Hollywood's top leading men and their blockbuster movies 
By Dave Yen 
Staff Writer 

No one can ever forget Jack 
Nicholson's deranged yet strangely 
charismatic patient Randle 
McMurphy in "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" or Marlon Bran-
do's stoic Vito Corleone in ''The 
Godfather: Part One." Great actors 
such as Nicholson, Brando, Hoff-
man and De Niro have graced our 
silver screens for decades. Often, 
they are the central element that 
makes or breaks a film. 

The '90s have witnessed an 
emerging crop of talented actors. 
While some veteran actors have 
faded, others have leaped to the 
forefront. Other actors have 
revived their careers or begun to 
explore nC?w genres or stretch their 
acting abilities. Here is a look at the 
best actors of the decade, their most 
critical roles and a peek at who will 
be the next superstars of the millen-
nium. 
1. Anthon, HopkIns 

His earlier work often goes 
unnoticed, but Hopkins, who 
brings a delightful mixture of 
stage and film acting together, has 
always been brilliant. He is one of 
the few actors who can convey a 
wide range of emotions to an 
audience without even moving his 
lips. 

In 'The Silence of the Lambs," 
he became an international sensa-
tion by portraying the terrifying 
serial killer Hannibal Lecter. But 
despite that, he has never been 
typecast. His subsequent roles 

include a butler in "Remains of the 
Day,l and an ex-President in 
·'Nixon." Lately, Hopkins has 
opted to star in more action-orient-
ed films, such as ''The Edge" and 
''The Mask of Zorro." 

Although we woulcllike to see a 
return to more dramatic fare, Hop-
kins steals the show in most films, 
even when he is the supporting 
role. Just ask Brad Pill ("Meet Joe 
Black") and Antonio Bandaras 
(,'The Mask of Zorro"). 

Hopkins, who has recently indi-
cated that he will take a break from 
acting, can next be seen in the sus-
pense thriller "Instinct" with Cuba 
Gooding Jr. due in June. 

"The Silence of the I..cmbs" (A-) 
"Nixon" (A) 
"Howard's End" (8+) 

2. Geoffre, ... _ 
Some people still do not know 

who he is, but Rush will be a 
household name in five years ... 
guaranteed. Since his Oscar win for 
best actor in "Shine," Rush has 
been in three films, giving terrific 
performances in all of them. . 

In the two Elizabethan films 
released this year, Rush demon-
strates his talents as an actor by 
playing two completely different 
characters. In "Elizabeth," he is the 
cunning and dangerous adviser to 
Cate Blanchett's queen. In "Shake-
speare in Love," he is hardly recog-
nizable at first as the pathetic the-
ater owner who is in danger of get-
ting his nose cut off. 

Paclno's an 
established, veteran 
actor that keeps 
getting better and 
better. As the 
venerable Michael 
Corleoae In the 
"Godfather," Paclno 
was a match for 
Brando's aging 
father. 

But Rush will forever be known 
for "Shine," where he mesmerized 
audiences as the young piano 
prodigy David Helfgotl. His 
incomprehensible speech patterns 
and constant nervousness endeared 
him to critics and viewers alike. 
With Rush, who is one of the hard-
est workers in show business, you 
get the impression that he is not 
just playing the character. He is the 
character. 

Rush can next be seen in the

action/comedy "Mystery Men," 
due in summer. 

"Shine" (A-) 
"Shakespeare in Love" (6) 
"Les Miserables" (8+)' 

3.TOIR ...... 
Hanks is widely hailed as the 

most popular actor of the decade, 
by virtue of his back-to-back 
Oscar wins and box office appeal. 
He is also hailed 'as one of Holly-
wood's nicest guys. · As almost 
every actor and director will tell 
you, there is not much to dislike 
about Hanks. 

Since entertaining audiences 
with comic sensations such as 
"Big" and "Joe vs. The Volcano," 
Hanks has tapped into his dramatic 

. well and tarred in hits such as 
"Forrest Gump," "Apollo 13" and 
"Saving Private Ryan." 

Although Hanks was good in 
"Gump," the role required more 
of a physical than an emotional 
transformation. There were beller 
performances that year, especial-
ly Morgan Freeman's prison 
inmate in "The Shawshank 
Redemption. " 

In "Apollo 13," and "Ryan," 
Hanks played the team leader and 
his main goal was keeping every-
one on task. Again, he was solid, 
but his role was limited and his 
success was largely determined by 
the film's commercial success. 

In "Philadephia," however, 
Hanks gave one of the '90s' most 
captivating performances. As a gay 

man inflicted with-the AIDS vi rus, 
Hanks exudes a quiet inspiration 
and intensity that stays with audi-
ences long after his death and the 
film's credits. Hanks can next be 
seen in the adapted Stephen King 
prison drama 'The Green Mile," 
due in December. 

"Philadelphia" (A-) 
"Forrest Gump" (6) 
"Saving Private Ryan" (A-) 

4 ................. 
There are at least two sides to 

every character that Fiennes 
plays. In "Schindler's List," he 
matched Liam Neeson step for 
step and then accomplished the 
impossible: To bring an ounce of 
likability or sympathy to a Nazi ' 
war criminal. 

In "The English Patient," hi s 
character of the tortured and 
hideously burned pilot is the cen-
ter of everything. All you have to 
do is look into his eyes to feel the 
intensity and the hidden emo-
tions. 

Like Rush, Tom Cruise and 
others, Fiennes is very selective 
with his roles. He opts for critical 
fare and plays characters who usu-
ally display a significant flaw. 
Thus, he always challenges him-
self and the people who watch 
him. 

In coming years, Fiennes should 
beware of his younger brother 
Joseph, who dazzled audiences in 
his debut "Shakespeare in Love."

DANCING DOWN THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY LINE 
UCSD students and faCUlty are key players in unique site-specific Trolley Dances' 
By Hannah Grlfftth 
Staff Writer 

A man sits near you on the trol-
ley car, gets up, dances around, sits 
down somewhere else, gets up .... 
The appropriate reaction to this 
surprising behavior last weekend 
was to join the Trolley Dances tour 
by gelling off at the next stop to 
watch more modem dance. 

This past Saturday and Sunday, 
"Trolley Dances" combined a ride 
on the trolley with an opportunity 
to see modem dance by both veter-
an and up-and-coming local chore-
ographers. UCSD faculty member 
Jean Isaacs, George Willis, Allison 
Cutri, Faith Jensen-Ismay and 
Terry Wilson choreographed 
dances specifically for certain sites 
between Qualcomm Stadium and 
the Gaslamp Quarter. Over 50 
dancers were involved, including 
six UCSD students and eight 
UCSD alumni. 

Each dance was different from 
the others and related specifically 
to its location. For example, Cutri, 
the project director, choreographed 
her dance in a studio, with the site 
- a water fountain in the Gaslamp 
Quarter - in mind. However, 
when she and the dancers started 
rehear ing at the site, she made 
alterations both to the movement 
and the costumes she had planned 
so that it would fit the space more 
specifically. 

Isaacs' dance in front of the 
large building downtown that hous-
es Immigration Services and the 

FBI featured eight dancers in busi-
ness suits on cement steps and 
blocks. Dancer Alison ·Dietterle. a 
biological anthropology major at 
UCSD, said that the tongue-in-
cheek piece is about when "the 
constraints of corporate life build 
up and true humanity comes 
through at unexpected moments." 
For example, the dancers would sit 
up straight like they were trying to 
pay attention. then seemingly loose 
control and slump over. 

The most intriguing dance site 
was the tunnel under the Old Town 
Transit Center tracks. The audience 
sat just outside the east end and 
watched the dancers performing 
inside the tunnel itself. The browns 
and reds of the costumes matched 
the tunnel 's wall tiles (a work of art 
themselves). However, the mellow 
qualities one might associate with 
earth tones were not to be found 
there; both the music and the move-
ment (by Jensen-Ismay) were exhil-
arating. Dancers managed to convey 
a sense of motion and urgency even 
while standing still (not that they did 
so the whole time) by jiggling their 
legs slightly. The dynamism of 
piece evoked the spirit of alternative 
forms of transportation. 

The project, which has been in 
the works for about a year, was ini-
tiated when Isaacs, the artistic 
director, went to a similar event in 
Switzerland that involved public 
transportation and art exhibits. 
Isaacs, who also heads the San 
Diego Dance Theater, proposed the 

idea to the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board, which quick-
ly saw its merit. 

One motive behind "Trolley 
Dances" was to make people more 
aware of alternative options for 
transportation. 

"They wanted us to start with 
this end of the trolley because it's 
not used much except for the base-
ball games," Isaacs said. "There is 
an excellent park-and-ride program 
that's underused." 

She was referring to the free 
parking available at Qualcomm sta-
dium, which is available all the 
time for people who want to drive 
only that far and commute the rest 
of the way to work on the trolley, 
thereby avoiding rush hour hassles 
and saving gas money. If the Trol-
ley Dances happen again next year, 
Isaacs said she would like to work 
with the part of the trolley line that 
goes to the Mexican border, and 
have the tour end there. 

UCSD dancer Sally Picciouo, 
who has just finished her doctorate 
in math~matics, made her profes-
sional debut dancing in Terry Wil-
son's piece, which was performed 
to on a stage in the Old Town Quar-
ter. Performed by four dancers in 
white skirts, it "evokes the sky, 
ocean, and the beauty of Califor-
nia," Picciotto said. 'There are a lot 
of parts where we're looking up as 
if we can see forever." 

Appropriate for its touristy sur-
roundings, the dance was very 
graceful and preuy, providing

something nice to look at without 
any meaty or controversial ele-
ments that might shock passers-by. 
The movement was very circular, 
and never sudden. 

"It was interesting how they 
combined traditional cultural ele-
ments with modem dance," ERC 
junior Kristin Johnson said. 'The 
costumes and music were Mexican 
and one would therefore expect a 
traditional Mexican dance, but it 

was modem dance!" 
Overall, ''Trolley Dances" made 

for a delightful excursion and a 
good eye-opener about dance and 
public transportation. 

"It's exciting to be part of such 
an original project," Picciotto said. 
"I think that the trolley is really 
cool; I hope the Trolley Dances get 
more people to use it, and that they 
get more people interested in mod-
em dance."

By Mike Tumer 
Staff Writer 

Several tangential rock albums 
have been released in 1998 and 
1999. Perhaps as a sign of the 
impending new millennium, artists 
like Tori Amos. Marilyn Manson 
and TLC have drastically chariged 
their image and sound. Beck's '98 
release. Mutations. is no exception. 

Beck Hansen is best known for 
his 1994 release, Mellow Gold and 
his 1996 release Odeiay, both on 
Geffen/Bong Load Records. These 
albums enjoyed a considerable 
amount of commercial success and 
firmly placed Beck into the vocab-
ulary of '90s rock artists. 

However, during those same 
years, Beck released two other 
albums: One Foot in the Grave and 
Ste~opathetic Soulmanu~ on inde-

BECK'S MUTATIONS 
The chromosome cowboy saddles up 
pendent labels. These releases were 
wholly different from Beck's main-
stream efforts. Their production . 
value was lower with the advertise-
ment and distribution very down-
played. However, it's quite clear 
that Beck's independent album are 
to be laken no less seriously than 
his popular records. What he lacks 
in frills, he makes up for in sinceri -
ty and originality, as he plays with 
much more offbeat themes in a 
more Folk influenced style. 

Mutations is, as the title sug-
gests. a conglomeration of both of 
his previous musical genres. Pro-
duced under Bong Load, the 
album received a high degree of 
commercial anticipation and com-
mercial studio time. However. the 
style of the music is clearly more 
representative of his folk efforts 
aside from popular trends. Accord-
ing to Beck the creation of the lat-
est release was most like that of 
Stereopathetic Soulmanure, in that 
he had free reign over the ele-
ments and did not try to cater to 
the popular charts. 

What fans of Beck will notice 
immediately is that Mutations is a 
lot less driven than the Beck songs 
that are played on the radio. Of the 
II tracks on the album, only two 
were given a modicum of ' radio 
play, "Lazy Flies" and "Tropi-
calia," and these examples are not 

representative of the album's direc-
tion as a whole. The electric guitars 
and thumping dance beats of Ode-
lay have been completely removed, 
replaced by non-western in tru-
ments, like the itar, and other 
acoustic instruments. Mutations 
has a cleaner sound with fewer cle-
ments coming together per song, 
and an overall slower pace. 

The more devoted Beck listen-
ers will recognize the similarity 
between the tracks from Mutations 
and the slower songs from Beck's 
previous works. The nostalgic and 
sentimental end songs from previ-
ous albums are representative of 
Beck's new direction. The lyrics 
are recognizably from the mind of 
Beck, with many varied and seem-
ingly random thoughts and images 
coming together, creating a mon-
tage with overlying unity. 

Regardless of the listener's pre-
vious experience with Beck, Muta-
tions deserves serious considera-
tion. Though the catchy and 
humorous elements that made Beck 
famous are downplayed, the level 
of musicianship and artistry cer-
tainly are as high as they have ever 
been. This exploration by Beck 
may be contrary to his previous 
commercial popularity but it is a 
contribution to late 20th century 
rock music that should not be over-
looked.

5. AI Paclno 
Pacino's an established, veter-

an actor that keeps getting beller 
and beller. A the venerable 
Michael Corleone in the "Godfa-
ther," Pacino was a match for 
Brando's aging father. He earned 
Oscar nominations for that role. 
and other. but it wasn' t until 
"Scent of a Woman" that he made 
his first , well-deserved tri.p to the 
podium. In that film , he studied 

. long and hard to play a retired 
army commander, both disgrun-
tled and blind (yet he drives and 
dances the tango). 

Pacino followed that with 
"Heat," a classic cop-and-robber 
yam featuring two of Holly-
wood's finest actors: Pacino and 
Robert De Niro. In that, he played 
the good guy, a person you root 
for. But what makes Pacino a 
great actor is his ability to tum 
around and accomplish the oppo-
si te, such as what he did in 
"Devil's Advocate," one of his 
most recent films. 

"Big AI" can next be seen in 
the fall film "Man of the People,"

who blows the whistle on the

industry.

"Heat" (A) 
"Donnie Brasco" (8+) 

Best of the Rest 
George Lucas entrusted Liam 

Neeson with the lead to the 
biggest movie of all time, but it 
was another legendary director, 
the enviable Steven Speilberg, 
who gave him his break in 
"Schindler's Li st." 

Sean Penn brings a natural 
charm to every role he plays, 
including a haunting killer on 
death row in "Dead Man Walk-
ing." 

John Travolta is truly the 
comeback kid with an eye for 
"Pulp Fiction ," and a Clin-
tonesque appeal to "Primary Col-
ors." 

While it is true that Denzel 
Washington always plays the 
moral crusader, he is a dynamic 
protagonist ("Cri mson Tide," 
"Courage Under Fire") and has 
deviated enough to show some 
dramatic flair ("Philadelphia," 
"Malcolm X"). 

Ewan MacGregor must show 
that "Trainspotting" was no fluke, 
but he will have to wait until 
"Episode II" to cast himself out of 
Liam Neeson's shadow. 

Brendan Fraser was superb in 
"Gods and Monsters," but needs 
to avoid such mindless, crowd-
pleasing fare like "The Mummy." 

Finally, Will Smith is a sensa-
tional star, but has yet to prove 
himself as an actor. Given the 
amount of money he pulls in for 
summer blockbusters, who 
knows, he may never do so.

Two More Polo Farewells 
GRADUATE: Two fonner redshirts will be wearing caps and gowns 

By Sarah Hollne 
Staff Writer 

But wait! There's more ... add 
two more seniors to the previous-
ly mentioned seven that are leav-
ing the men's water polo team 
this year. Two fourth year play-
ers, Ian Zakrzewski and Jacob 
Mazelis, decided to walk with 
their class and abandon their last 
year of eligibility, much to the 
dismay of the UCSD men 's water 
polo team. 

Zakrzewski, who was in the 
program for four years, redshirt-
ed his freshman year, but played 
his last three years on the team. 

A driver, Zakrzewski had a 
great work ethic and worked hard 
for four years under Head Coach

A great leader, he was well respect-

tance swimmers on the team. 

Greg Knoll is another team cap-
tain and notable team leader, and is 

Denny Harper. An incredible 
swimmer, this senior pushed the 
team in practice and worked hard 
in the games he played. 

Mazelis, a left-handed driver 
who also redshirted his first year, 
has been a Triton for four years. 
Harper praised him for working 
hard every day and pulling real 
effort into his play on the team. 
He was willing to accept a limit-
ed role in the games, which often 
happens when there are 20 men 
on a team that can only play

"Greg was a mentally tough

Everybody Out of the Pool 
SPLASH: McGihon will lose ten swimming senior leaders 

By Sarah Holine 
Staff Writer 

After a long collegiate career in the 
water, eventually you have to dry off. This 
year's senior swimmers will be washing 
their hair with the anti-chlorine shampoo, 
getting ready for the mortarboard this 
June. The UCSD Swimming and Diving 
team will being saying goodbye to ten out-
standing seniors and they most certainly 
will be missed. Seven women and three , 
meri are graduating and hanging up their 
speedos, leaving a long legacy of UCSD 
records and accomplishments behind. 

On the women's side, saying goodbye 
to Canyon view Pool will be Kelly Byrne, 
Linda Monroe, Sara Chu, Jenny Irwin, 
Kristi Jordan, len Connell an and Heather 
Willey. 

Byrne, one of the top swimmers in 
UCSD history, set school records in the 
400 individual medley and the 200 
freestyle this last winter. She was probably 
the most versatile swimmer on the team, 
doing whatever it took to make the team 
successful. 

As one of the team captains this year, 
Chu was always willing to 'Push herself 
past the point of exhaustion at practice, 
serving as an inspiration to her teammates. 
She was a tremendous worker and will be 
missed next year. 

Linda Monroe, a four-year swimmer, was 
also a very versatile swimmer on the team. 

"[Linda] • is a great person to be 
around," Head Coach Scott McGihon said. 
"She is always positive about what she's 
doing." 

The Tritons will also say goodbye to 
Irwin. an exceptional athlete, who excelled 
in both water polo and swimming. She was 
the most team oriented of the swimmers, 
always there for her teammates. A big part 
of the relays, Irwin was a member of three 
record-holding relay teams. 

Jordan, another team captain this year, 
was always looking for ways to rally the 
team, motivating everyone to swim well in 
practice or competition. 

Coach McGihon will also be losing Jen 
Connell an, one of his hardest working 
swimmers. She was a great inspiration to 
the rest of the team, and a great joy to 
coach. 

"Jen is the type of athlete that you wish 
you had a whole team of to coach," 
McGihon said. 

Willey is the only diver to leave this 
year, but her departure will still be a great 
loss to the diving team. After three years of 

. diving, she emerged as a superb leader. 
With her positive attitude, she set a good 
example for the freshman divers this year, 
proving to be a true role model. 

McGihon is also losing swimmers from 
the men's team. Though he is only losing 
three men, each one made a tremendous 
impact during his years on the team. Mark 
Beiter, Greg Knott and David Tudury are 
all leaving UCSD with the respect of their 
coach and teammates. 

Beiter, a three-year team captain, was

sonBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS UP FOR GRABS! 

It had to happen sooner or later. It just had to. The era of domination in sports of any kind has officially 
come to a close. There will be no more dynasties In the pro sports ranks for years to come. No more Bulls. 
no Broncs. no Yanks. no Wings. It·s over "finis! 

College sports .. . same deal. .. no more Huskers In football, Duke in basketball ... UCLA in volleyball. .. hey,

just that a whole lot more of us know what it takes to get what we want ... especially in organized sports. 

Even in our own IrUramural Sports world right here at the '"U", you feel the parity creeping into our 
environment. Take a look at 1M Softball for example. One hundred and thirty (130) teams are playing this 
season. How many of them are undefeated in a five game season? Only seven. Seven ... thal's right! 

In most years .. . ?O would be a low number for the number of 5-0 teams entering the post season. This 
year it appears that parity has hit. Only two men's teams out of 60 made it through the regular season 
without a loss (DSP who played a short season and Siphilus" of all teams). The rest got dinged. In Coed

Sun God Sports Festival 
Sun, Fun & Plenty of Great Action 
Basketball 

The annual slam dunk basketball affair kicked off at 8am with the 
early risers playing in the intermediate division. The crowd was up on 
their feet early and often with three courts of slamming and jamming, 
highlighted by the earthquake jam of a 325 pounder that goes by the 
nickname of Oaewoo. He nearly tore off the rim. and the backboard is 
said to still be shaking even today. 

There is an old rule in 1M Sports that says Sandbaggers rarely win 
championships. Well. another squad leamed the hard way last Saturday. 
The'AM Champions from Winter quarter thought they could play down in 
the intermedtate division and steal the mle and all of the great prizes. I'm sure they envisioned themselves 
enjoying dinner and micro-brewed beer over at Rock Bottom while they wore their new shirts and listened to 
their new CD's from Universal in the car during the victory parade. They nearly lost in the first round 01 the 
playoffs to a team that Included the oldest, most arthritic 21 year old on the planet. Then Ihe bitter pill was 
delivered in the next round by the eventual champion. Schockers. In the final game the Shockers were 
pushed by the upstart Fab 5 Freshman who nearly pulled off the impossible - winning The Sun God In your 
first outing. 

In the open division it was more of the same. The team loaded with stars from the UCSO Men's Basket· 
ball Team. Omega Killers. figured to plow through the field. Well. it was a group of talented ree ba11 fanatics 
that derailed the hopes of Team Tritons in the semi·finals. Viagra II was largely the same team that won last 
year. minus a 6-9 monster in the middle. Led by the inspired play of Court Gardner and Team Captain Javier 
Scalini. they just played solid ball all day and avoided the lane clogging, hacking style that most teams 
brought to the court. For the first time in memory, no players from the Men's Basketball team were on the 
winning team in this division. Does that say anything abOut next year's Triton squad? 

Maybe the best competition of the day was found in the slam dunk contest. Adam Libby. The mysterious 
Reed and Eric McNally put up a good fight. but it was volleyball star Zack Hite who brought down the house. 
He double-pumped, 360'd and reverse jammed his way to the crown of best dunker on campus. He took 
home a new pair of Puma shoes for his efforts. 

7 -on-7 Soccer 
Nothing is better after a long night of partying than getting up early the next morning to playa little 

soccer. right? Well, it always seems like a good idea when you sign up. Looking at some of the faces on 
Saturday moming, it was easy to see that there was plenty of second guessing going on. 

Especially when everyone got a look at the schedule of games. It was 4 hours of soccer action with 
barely enough time to get a drink between games, and then the playoffs. By the time Liquor Box was putting 
on the championship t-shirts at about 4pm. they were definitely ready for the showers. dinner and an early 
night. Ya RighI! Liquor Box?l? 

Coed Floor Hockey 
It was a cory, intimate gathering of floor hockey veterans that strolled in at the leisurely hour of 11 am to 

get the toumament started. No hangovers in this crowdl But. plenty of fast·paced hockey action lay ahead . 
The tiHe game was destined to be a thriller. Puck RA met Steric Hindrance during pool play where Ihey 

ball1ed into overtime with Puck coming out on top. Sure enough. the championship game went O·T as well . 
About 3 minutes Into sudden death the soon·to-be-wed Tanja Canter hustled in off a line change and found 
a wide open net and the ball on a tee right In front. She popped ~ in for the 6-4 win. What better way to head 
to the aner. than with a Sun God liHe under your belt. 

Both squads husHed out to the Rae Gym patio for plua and fresh·brewed beer from the folks at Pizza 
Port. Alter a long tough day of taking shots in the thigh. getting your shins whacked and trying to keep your 
nose out of someone's backswing it was the perfect way to say goodbye to another great Sun God Sports 
Festival.

UCSD started slow at the Division ill National 
Championships in Massachusetts, but the Tritons are 
looking to place high, only seven strokes out of third 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

Misty Massachusetts has been the 
backdrop for a rather strange 25th NCAA 
Division m Golf National Championship 
at Williams College. Some of the 
powerhouses of the past have 
been washed back into the 
pack, while the sun has been 
shining on some previously 
unheard of schools. 

Adding to the confusion is 
the uncertainty of the weather. 
The first two rounds were completed 
as scheduled, but rain washed out yester-
day 's round, and boih of the final rounds 
will be played today (weather permitting, 
of course). 

UCSD is known as one of the power-
houses of Division m golf. However, the 
Trito~s are in the midst a peculiar 1999 
showing. Head Coach Mike Wydra got a 
tremendous opening day from Greg 
Johnson, who shot a 3-over-par 74, which 
tied him for sixth overall (there are over 
120 golfers in attendance). However, the 
rest of the Tritons were not up to par, as 
the next best finishers were James 
Donahoe and Matt C8{isarino in 56th (79). 

Kevin Petrie turned in an 80 to put him 
in nnd, while Ben Page tied for 94th with 
an 83. The Tritons, accustomed to annual 
top:5 finishes (UCSD was fifth in 1998), 
ended the opening day tied for ninth place 
with Emory University (Ga.). 

Day two offered more brooding skies, 
as clouds dominated the humid afternoon. 
It was not a good day for the opening 
round superstar Johnson, who carded an 
81 and tumbled to a tie for 37th. However, 
Donahoe climbed up to a tie for 23rd with 

a marvelous 74. Petrie made the biggest 
climb for UCSD, as he vaulted from an 
opening day nnd to 28th on day two with 
a 74 of his own. Cassarino imprOVed his 
opening day 79 by one shot, and he 
. moved up one place to 55th. Page 

shook off his awful opening 
round and turned in a nice 77 to 

move up from 94th into 74th. 
As a team, UCSD moved 

up into eighth place with a 
two-day team total of 615. As 

eighth is still not where UCSD 
wants to be, the Tritons are improv-

ing. They have their eyes on the top five, 
as the six schools in front of UCSD are 
separated by a total of 7 strokes. In team 
play, seven strokes is easily overcome. 

Rounding out the standings after two 
days of play, Methodist College, winner of 
eight of the last nine championships 
(UCSD broke up the string with a win in 
1993), is leading with a score of 594. 
Gustavus Adolphus University jumped 
into second with a 602 on the strength of a 
great second day, posting the best one-day 
score of any squad, 293. Otterbein College 
is tied for third with Greensboro College at 
608. Wisconsin-Eau Claire is in fifth with 
609. Allegheny College is in sixth with 612 
and Williams College is in seventh at 613. 

With all 36 final holes being played 
today (again, weather permitting), it will 
further muddle the standings. If teams are 
fatigued by the opening round, the after-
noon session could prove to be disastrous. 
Coaching could also prove to be crucial to 
success, and the Tritons are in good hands 
with the steady Wydra. He has proved to 
be an outstanding coach at these events, 
and he always has his troops ready.

Shabel AdvanceS to the Quarterfinals at Nationals 
CLOSE: At the Division III Men's Tennis National Championship, Steve Shabel beats two opponents but loses in elite eight 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

When the season for the UCSD 
men's tennis team came to a close 
back on April 27th, two members 
of the team just kept on practic-
ing. 

Although the Tritons were not 
invited to the NCAA Division ill 
National Championships as a team, 
both Steve Shabel and Mike Rosset 
were invited to compete in the 
championships. Shabel and Rosset 
were UCSD's representatives in the 
doubles portion, while Shabel rep-
resented the Tritons in the singles 
portion, as well . 

The championships were hosted 
right up the road in Clairemont, 
Calif. on the campuses of Pomona-
Pitzer and Claremont 
College. The Tritons did 
not disappoint. 

While ' the 
Tritons' No. I dou-
bles tandem was 
ousted in the first 
round, Shabel made 
waves at the championships 
by advancing all the way to the 
quarterfinals before finally bowing 
out. 

On Monday, Rosset and Shabel 
met up with Evan Hornbuckle and 

Daniel Matro of Williams College 
(Mass.), who had just led their 
team to the National Championship 

in the team competition on 
Sunday. Apparently, 

Hornbuckle and Matro 
still had enough gas 
left in the tank to 
defeat the Tritons, but 

it wasn't an easy victory. 
Rosset and Shabellost the 

first set 2-6, but battled back to 
take the second set 6-4. 
Unfortunately the Triton duo 
dropped the third set 4-6 to lose the 
match. 

While Rosset's championship 

stay was over, Shabel's was just 
beginning. The Triton singles star 
defeated two opponents on 
Monday in the singles competition 
to advance to the quarterfinals of 
the championships on Tuesday. 

Shabel blew through his round 
one opponent Dan Harding from 
Kalamazoo College 6-1, 6-1 . 
Kalamazoo had been on the runner-
up squad in the team competition, 
but Harding was obviously no 
match for Shabel. In the second 
round, Shabel went on to defeat 
Eric Hasenauer of Williams. The 
first set was a hard-fought 6-4 vic-
tory for Shabel, but Shabel went on 

to shut out Hasenauer 6-0 in the 
second set to take the match. 

Unfortunately for Shabel, 
Tuesday was when the fun ended. 
Brian Cummings of UC Santa Cruz 
ended the senior's run with a tight 
6-4, 7-5 victory. Cummings is the 
defending Division III Singles 
National Champion. 

The loss ended a long success-
ful career for Shabel at UCSD. 
Playing No. I singles and doubles, 
Shabel has been All-American four 
times. A pre-med student with a 
3.84 grade point average, he is also 
a three-time Academic AII-
American.
