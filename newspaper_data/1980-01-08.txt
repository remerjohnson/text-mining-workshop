Day Care Center Turned 
Down by. State for Funds 
To Expand Child Care 

By Eric Jaye 
The "lUre thing" grant from the State 

Department of Education which would have 
allowed UCSO'. Day Care Center to nearly 
double its capacity hal fallen through. 

A. a consequence, the Regi.tration Fee 
Committee, which in November gave the 
Center $31,000 in expansion fund. and 
$3,664 for increased operating co.t., hal 
taken back its money, according to 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage. 

The $25,648 SOE grant would have 
allowed the center to care for 40 infants in 
addition to the 45 children of at lea.t walking 
age which currently attend the center. The 
funds would have been used for the purchase of 
a trailer to house the infants. 

The Reg Fee committee indicated in 
November when it gave the center the money 
that the allocation was contingent on the award 
of the SOE grant. That grant, the committee 
was told by Laura Long of the Business Office, 
was almo.t a certainty. . 

UCSO's proposal was part of a group of 
grant reque.ts totalling $52 million in 

co~tition for $four million in .tate funds. 
The proposal was ranked sixth in its infant 

care category, with only the top two contenders 
receiving any funds, according to SOE official 
Don Reed. 

A. of last night UCSO and State official. 
were contradicting each other aboiut why the 
were contradicting each other about why the 
grant was not awarded. 

Long says she first received indications from 
Sacramento that UCSO had an inside track on 
the grant and from this information sprung her 
optimistic report to the Reg Fee committee. 

She learned later that there had been an 
"exceptional .. number of applicants for grants, 
and UCSO had been edged out. 

However, Reed said . in Sacramento 
yeaterday that there had been the normal 
number of i!wlicants. 

And UCSD Day Care Center Josie Foulks 
said yesterday afternoon that though she had 

Iran Expert to Speak:

James A. Bin, one of the few academicians in 
the nation speciaJizing in the domestic policies 
of Iran, will speak here next T ueaday at 8 pm in 
USB 2722. 

Bill, a professor at the University of Texas 
and Acting Director for its Center for Middle 
Eastern Studies, has titled his lecture , "America 
and the Iranian Revolution: An International 
Watershed." 

He wiD examine current events in .ht of 
Iranian history and US policy in the MiddIe 
Eait. 

BiD has frequently expreaaed contempt for 
American understanding of events in. Iran. 

"America knows a.tonishingly little about 
Iran," he says. "Few Americ:aII officials have 
the linguistic fluency, intellectual curiousity, 
pel'lOnai fortitude or occupational time to pierce 
the crUit of Iranian society." 

He allO says cover~ of Iran by the

heard rumors the grant had been delayed, she 
had not heard that it had not been awarded. 

Long said that Foulk. had been lent a copy 
of the refusal letter as lOOn as it was received in 
hte December. 

Both Long and Foulks seemed to agree, 
though that the center would have a better 
chance of attracting .tate fund. it the Reg Fee 
committee let it keep the money and the 
expanded program were in operation. 

"It's a risk the Reg Fee committee will have 
to weigh," Long said last night, explaining that 
the risk was the possibility that after money had 
been spent of the purchase of a facility the state 
money would not come through. 

Saxon to Visit 
Chinese Schools 
In UC Exchange 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Newt Editor 

UC President David Saxon will visit the 
People's Republic of CRna for three weeks in 
late March and early April, his executive 
assistant said yesterday. 

Saxon will spend the"time touring universities 
with which diHerent UC schools, includina 
UCSO, have exchange agreements, and wiD 
hold talks with representatives 01 thOle 
universities. 

A. yet, only hi. executive assistant, David 
WailOn hu p1amed to accompany the-
eresident, but two or ' three professors 
'knowled.Jeabie on <lUna" will probably also 
tour the People's Republic, Wilson said. 

The tentative date for Saxon's departure is 
March 23, cholen because there is no Regents' 
meeting during the scheduled tour. 

Saxon will concentrate on several different 
gueltions while in the People's Republic, 
Wilson said. " 

He wants to find out why 10 few Americans 
have gone to China on exchange programs, 
and wants to inspect conditions at univer.ities 
there. He will a110 meet with Ministry of 
Education officials, who invited him to China. 

But Saxon hal no let itinerary yet, though he 
will probably visit Japan before he goes to 
China. In Japan, Wilson ~fS, he will also tOOr 
Wlivenitiea with which UC has exchange 
~ams. 

Saxon, one of "the only top officials in the 
UC system who hasn't been to China," Wilson 
noles, will be temporarily replaced while in 
China by .ystem vice-president Wdliam 
Fretter, who ulually take. over when Saxon is 
out 01 the country. 

It hal not been decided, Wason said, whether 
Saxon will take vacation time while in C"na or 
continue to receive his salary as university 
preaident. 
UCSO is one of leveral UC schools which have 
concluded agreements with the People'l 
Republic of China to conduct exchange

3 . UCSD Experiments 
Picked for Space lab 

Three experiments propoaed by utso School of Medicine 
scientists were among the 82 selected by the National 
Aeronautic. and Space Administration for its Life Sciences 
space million. 

Dr. Alan R. Hargens, Dr_ ADen F. Ryan, and Dr. John B. 
West, are turrently fine-tuning their experiments for the future 
voyage into space. 

Spacelab, the reusable spaceborne laboratory to be used in 
the mission, was constructed as a major component of the space 
shuttle program. The versatile laboratory will serve al an 
extension to the investigators' ground-based laboratories, with 
an additional characteristic essential to their re.~tive trials -
long-term zero-gravity. 

Liftoff for the firat life Sciences Space million il currently 
scheduled for May, 1983. 

Hargens, associate research physiologi.t in the division of 
orthopedics, hopes to utilize the zero-sravity laboratory to 
investigate tissue-fluid changes and muscle function in humans, 
before, during and after weightleune ... 

The redistribution of feet and leg tisaae-f1uid during zero-
gravity, into the chest and head, causes abnormal fluid 
accumulation in facial ti .. ues, called edema. Converlely, 
astronauts experience severe leg pains following reentry to 
Earth's gravity, pouibly caused by the fluids returning to the 
lower portions of the body. 

Accurate data on the extent and effect of body fluid shifts will 
contribute to the further development of space medicine. 

Hargens also plans an exercise program to ~"2termine if 
specific exercises can prevent or minimize the expected decrease 
in size and strength of the IOleus muscle, a leg muscle that 
counteracts the force of gravity. 

Ryan, assistant adjunct professor in the division of 
otolaryngology, is interested in the complex fluid environment of 
the inner ear during weightle.sness. Inner ear dysfunction dwing 
zero-gravity is a biomedical hazard to humans during space 
fliaht, since it is known to cause nausea.

Small Firms Left In Cold 
By We. ley Marx 

America's IOrar energy program is moving full steam ahead-
in Saudi Arabia. 

In mid . December, the The Daily Guardian 
Georgia.based Martin· 
Marietta Corp. won a $16 
million contract to design and ,. 
build the world's largest OPINION 
photovoltaic IOlar system 30 
miles northwest of the Saudi 
capital of Riyadh. Photovoltaic cells are aemi·conductor devices 
that convert IOIar energy to electricity. The 350·kilowatt system 
will "solarize" an entire community and help convert seawater to 
drinking.water. 

The U.S. taxpayer is allO involved in this project, but not on a 
profit. making basis. The lucrative contract was awarded under a 
joint $100 million solar cooperative program between the U.S, 
and Saudi Arabia. 

Wesley.Marx, author of "The Frail Ocean" and "Acts of God, 
Acts 01 Man, "lectur.es in UC Irvine's social ecoloRY proRram. He 
wrote this stoTY for facilic News Service. 

Why is the U.S. subsidizing a glamorous solar project in an oil· 
rich desert kingdom when we could benefit from such project. in 
our own backyard? ' 

In 1977, the U.S. and Saudi Arabian governments signed the 
$100 million agreement to jointly support solar research and 
development. Another priority project will test an advanced solar 
cooling system in Saudi Arabia. This'arrangement is the largest of 
a series of cooperativ~ solar agreements with Israel, Japan, 
RUllia and other countriel. 

Arab interest in the joint program is understandable. Arab 
nations presently lack the technical capacity to make the sun a 
wann friend, even though they have the physical environment 
conducive to solar use. 

Solar power could provide the oil.producing nations with a 
critical energy back.up system much less vulnerable to natural 
and man· induced hazards, including terrorism, than oil arid 
nuclear·based systems. Moat significantly, the more their own 
domestic fuel conllWllption can be cut, the more oil Saudi Arabia 
can export to industrial nationa. 

One Arab officifl.told Miroalav UfO.hevich, of Alpha Solarco, 
Inc., Cincinnati, that evf!fY barrel of oil consumed at home costs 
Saudi Arabia $13 in earninga. 

The basi. of U.S. involvement in the project is leu clear. The 
U.S. has sites jUit .. conducive to solar use, such a. the 
Southwest, .. Saudi Arabia. -50 do our close oiI.producing 
neif(hbo,., Mexico and Canada. 

But the u.s. doea benefit from finding a partner willins to Me 
in some of the risk and funding in. developing IOIar technology, 
even if done at long range. Indeed, the U.S . ...Bovernment hal a 
much harder time finding domeltic partner •. The Department of 
Energy often mUlt come up with 100 percent federal funding 
before a large technical corporation will be motivated to establiall 
a solar reiearch branch. The oil corporation., which have the belt 
combination of technical and financial resources, prefer to lobby 
for federally subsidized synfuel development. 

Small private firms in the U.S. solar field now fear that proceeds 
from the windfall oil profits tax will 80 back to the very same oil 
corporations being taxed to develop energy.inten.ive, water· 
intensive .ynfuel projectl. 

U.S. IOlar finns realize that Middle East solar perlpectives 
extend beyond rhetoric. A Texas manufacturer of IOIar panels, 
American Solar King, hal built a plant in JOI'dan and is 
constructing another in Saudi Arabia. Solar King president Brian 
Pardo says the firm did $1.5 million in bUlines. in the Middle East 
in 1978. 

U.S. IOlar manufacture,. argue that the export of their productl 
could help reverse the national trade deficits cauaed by o~ imports 
and that the government .houlcl help open more doo,. OVerMIII. 
"1l1ey support large nuclear .aIeI and .y.tem ..... , so why can't 
they support small companies' solar .aIes?" aaka Gary Noonan of

Soviets Kill UN Plan; 
100,000 'Policing' 

UNITED NA nONS - The Soviet Union vetoed a Security 
Council resolution on Monday calling for withdrawal of foreign 
troops from Afghanistan, killing the measure despite its passage 
by a 13·2 vote of the council. 

The resolution, sponsored by five non.aligned members of the 
council, did not mention the Soviet Union by name, but Soviet 
chief delegate, Amballador OIeg Troyanov.ky, still voted 
against it. Approval by the Soviet Union, as a permanent member 
of the Security Council, is required for pallage of any resolution. 

The other negative vote was cast by Moscow.a1lied East 
Germany, a new non.permanent member of the council. 

Troyanovsky, .peaking jUit before the vote, reiterated the 
Soviet claim that it was asked by Af,han authorities to send 
military aid. He said the resolution was a flagrant intervention in 
the allai,. of a IOvereign .tate and should be rejected." 

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, Moslem Afghan rebel. claimed 
yesterday that they had control of three districts about 25 miles 
from the nation's northern border with the Soviet lInion and the 
capture of two towns near Pakistan. 

However, in a tacit acknowledgement of the nferiority of their 
position, the rebels said thay are stepping up hit-and·run guerrilla 
attacks again.t tne better·armed Soviet troops. 

One rebel in Masdhad, Iran; said, "groups of guerrillas are 
coming and going regularly between Iran and Afghanistan." That 
report, like the others, could not be independently confirmed. 

The U.S. State Department said the Soviet troop presence in 
and near Afghanistan may now exceed 100,000

A commercial coiLIliqueiaction plant would 
process about 20,000 tp 40,000 tons of coal 
per day, imd Penner believes the liist 
commercial plant will be in operation by the 
mid.1980s. _ _ 

Converlion to GalOline Seen 81 Anlwer 
the Department of Energy on reeearch and 
development needs in the area of coal 
liquefaction. 

As Penner laY', "We tell them what needs to 
be done." lbe "them" u1timatly ~ferl to the 
many commercial organization. who are 
currently working with or in the proceu of 
developing coal liquefaction plante. 

The proceasee behind coverting coal to 
llaaoline are complex and because of thi., many 
cifferent procedlftl of coal liquefaction have 
been developed. 

The actual function of the F ouiI Energy 
Reeearch Workshop Group is to travel to 
liquefaction plant lites and .tudy their 
ptoeeslel. The group then writes a report on the 
site and its process and submits it to the 
Department of Energy. Penner refe,. to the 
Workshop Group as an independent group that 
is making sure the job i. being done in a 
scientific way and adds, "If we don't think a 
process is good. we tell them."

Research on the ·growth of cancerous tumors in a 

mutant .train of nude mice may lead to finding ways 
of controlling a wide variety of cancers in humans, 
scientists at the School of Medicine are "fing. 

Dr. Nathan Kaplan and. Dr. Gordon Sato are 
conducting the experiments, which involve 
implanting human cancer. underneath the .kin of the 
mice and obIerving what eRect various chemicals · 
have on the. growth of the tumors. 

The immunological .ystem of normal mice would 
cause the anirnaIi to reject the tumor. from their 
bodies as foreign material, but these hairles. mice are 
a mutant main which have no thymUi (the gland 
which controls the immunological system) and 
therefore accept the tumors and allow them to grow 
"essentiaUy as they would in a human," according to 
Kaplan . . 

"The mice provide a very good model for human 
reaction" to chemotherapy, said Paul Bartl, businese 
manager for the group. 

Kaplan emph8lized, however, that it will take 
lOme time before it i. proved that the growth of 
human cancers in the mice is the same 81 in humans. 
"But we are pretty convinced that the tumors retain 
at leaat 90 percent of their characterilltics" after the 

implantation! he said. 
After the tumors have grown in the mice (a process 

which takes from three weeks to ieveral months, 
depending on the cancer), .amples are transplanted 
into a tiHue culture in the Iaborato,}" where the 
biochenlistry of the tumor it .tudied. By obaerving 
what .ubstances are helpful and what substances are 
harmful to the growth of the tumoraL. the researcher. 

and wiJlsoon be used ~ human patienb, laid Kaplan; 
The researcher. plan to begin work 100I'I linking 

the growth of tumors with nutrition. "We are pretty 
certain that nutrition h.. a definite effect on the 
growth and . inhibition of cancer," acconin, to 
Kaplan. 
. The colony of aImoet 5000 mice, located in Third 

College Laboratory on Matthews ~ .. " ill one of 
the Iar.aest in the United StalelLa@I~~ 

Colony of 5,000 Mice Test Subjects 
. can determine how to try to inhibit the growth of the 
cancer in the mice, eventually leading to an eRective 
treatment for that cancer in human., Kaplan 
explained. 

Kaplan and Sato are "just at the beginning" of 
what they feel can be accomplished with the 
experirnenb. They hope to eventually have a .y.tem 
which can find treatments for many kinds of human 
cancer. 

They have already found a drug which appean to 
be eRective against a number of cancer. of the colon 

The re ..... ch is funded by the NatioMllJIItitute of 
Health with a unalI amount from II. An.ic:an 
Cancer aociety. Whie Dr. Kaplan would not live an 
exact figure, he did lay that "to properly conduct 
research of thiI nature requires at least a ....... 
dollars a ,year." The work had been ... on for 
ahnoet three years. 

Approximately 35·45 people work on the project, 
including ,raduate .tudenb, . .,a.t-doc:tor .... , 
medical .tudente and under.,aduates. . 

'We owe a lot to thoee first studentI," he II1id. 
"Without them the project would probably never 
have gotten to where it it today."

~ence is costly urban sprawl. 
There are lOme who would 
ar,ue for another alternative·· 
who believe that by 
deliberately failing. to provide 
schools, other public facilities 
and by not buildina homes, we 
can control our population. 
'The evidence shows dearly 
that lack of facilities does not 
keep away immigrants, 
whether we are talking about 
Chicago, or Cairo, or next 
door to us in Tijuana. 

The aver,e price of a new 
home in an Diego is 
approtimateiy $106,000 and 
riam, at double digit rates. In 
order to qualify for a lien on the 
average home, an income of 

more that $40,000 is 
necessary. Most young people 
are priced out of the new home 
market and probably out of the 
used home market also, 
becaule the iupply of 
moderately priced housing il 
insufficient to meet the 
demand. It. is imperative that 
we meet our responsibilities 
and prevent a lituation where 
only the rich and fortunate can 
afford housing in San Diego. 
The development of North 
City Weat is a part of the 
overall plan to r.rovide a 
variety of wei .planned 
housing to accomodate some 
of the people with smaller
