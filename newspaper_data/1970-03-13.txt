Murphy, Saltman Firing Called For 
by .Local Republicans Chapter 

Jay Sherman 
Staff Writer 

A resolution condemning Revelle Provost Paul 
Salbnan and Vice-Chancellor George Murphy was 
passed by the San Diego County Republican Central 
Committee Monday due to the administrators' 
alleged failure to quiet hecklers as assemblyman 
John Stull spoke here last Friday. 

The Republicans are calling on the Regents to 
remove Salbnan's and Murphy's " tenure" because 
they " took no action to stop the disruptions or 
reprimand the student barbarians, thereby per· 
mitting a group of students to act publicly in an anti· 
social and emotionally immature way." 

When asked by the Triton Times why he did not 
stop the disruptions, Murphy, who holds no tenure 
as Vice-Chancellor, commented that the crowd was 
not out of control . "Only the first few minutes of the 
speech had me worried. Mter that the crowd 
seemed to control itself as listeners quieted the 
hecklers ," he said. 

Saltman was out of town and could not be reached 
for comment. 

in case of an incident. 
Murphy, undisturbed by the Central Committee 's 

action, said, " In my job people often fire bullets at 
me. I don't think anything will become of this 
resolution. " 

Phrases in the resolution show a marked 
similarity to statements shouted by former 
assistant to the dean of student affairs John Geddes 
'to the audience during the speech. Geddes termed 
the hecklers " rude barbarians" at that time. 

The AS Senate responded Tuesday to the 
resolution by drafting their own resolution, praising 
the way Murphy and Salbnan handled the crowd 
and condemning Geddes for his " irresponsible 
outbursts ... and for the lies and distortions which 
he apparently conveyed to the Republican Central 
Committee. " 

The AS resolution, however, was tabled in· 
definitely upon Murphy 's point of personal 
privilege. He warned the Senate that to condemn 
the Central Committee would be to " rise to the bait 
that has been dangled," and that the political 
group's reaction " is not deserving of the AS's at· 
tention." 

Assemblyman John stull , 

Chancellor William McGill said, "As far as I can 
determine the crowd was spirited, but to say they 
were barbarians is an obvious distortion of the 
facts ." McGill was advised not to attend the speech 
after he had escor.ted Stull to campus, but he did 
stay by his office phone where he could be reached 

McGill said that Murphy and Saltman are 
" marvelous administrators" and that he would 
stand firmly on their behalf if the Regents, who will 
receive copies of the resolution, move to take any 
action to oust them.

Stull Greeted with 'Enthusiasm' 
Molly Selvin 
Staff Writer 

The visit of the conservative Republican 
Assemblyman John Stull from Leucadia 
last Friday climaxed a week of tension on 
the part of faculty members, ad· ' 
ministration, radic~8, conservativ~s, and 
moderates on cllllJptlS, as well as Stull 
himself. 

The possibility of a confrontation ' bet. 
ween students and Stull was predicted to 
be so imminent that the Assemblyman had 
reportedly scheduled a news conference to 
follow his talk in USB 2722 in the event of 
any such violence. However, neither the 
violence nor the news conference oc· 
curred. Flyers were distributed "in ad· 
vance of his talk on environtlJtQtal 
pollution; some urging students, thro\1gh 
the exercise of restraint during his speech, 
not to provide Stull with another instance 
in which to criticize the university, and 
some mocking his presence on campus and 
urging open baiting of the legislator. 

Several people attending the Wk in 2722 
were dressed in an apparent satire of 
conservative America - with greasy, 
large cigars, business suits, American 
flags and loud mouths. On stage, a student 
dressed as a gorilla greeted the startled 
assemblyman when he arrived thirty 
minutes late. 8DS members passed out 
marshmallows to be thrown mockingly at 
hecklers, while others passed out com· 
puter paper and marking pens with which 
to make signs. Balloons and paper air-
planes PWlCtured the smoke-lilled room. 

The auditorium was jam· 
med - students, administrators, faculty, 
and some off-campus visitors all came to 
hear Stull and watch the "show." As the 
estimated 500 listeners grew restless, 
choruses of "America the Beautiful" and a 
rendering of the Pledge of Allegiance 
helped let off steam. 

Once Stull arrived, accompanied by 
Chancellor McGill, who declined to stay 
for the speech, his speech was interrupted 
repeatedly with heckling, farcical 
cheering, and laughter. Principal objects 
of the crowd's displeasure were Gov. 

' Reagan, and President Nixon. 

At one point, the heckling was in· 
terrupted by John Geddes, who, as a 
former assistant to the dean of student 
affairs, accused the campus of 
preferential treabnent to radicals and of 
ignoring the desires of conservatives. 
Geddes, who is Stull's education advisor 
this year, shouted to the crowd, "You're 
all rude barbarians - let the man speak! " 

Vice-Chancellor ·;md Dean of Student 
Affairs George Mutphy turned to Geddes 
and reminded him that as a guest on 
campus, he could be asked to leave if he 
caused any problems. 

People Cause Pollution 

Although he failed to present any new 
insights or solutions to the growing 
problem of environmental pollution, Stull 
indicated that the eonsumer, not industry. 
should bear the cost of pollution control. 
He declared that "emotional accUA8tionll 

and hysterical short-range solutions are 
not the answers." ' 

. 

He attacked Jess Unruh, the Assembly 
minority leader and 1970 Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate against Ronald 
Reagan, for his lack of a voting record on-
various recent anti-pollution bills. In 
contrast, he extolled the current state and 
national administrations for their 
recognition of and action on the problem of 
pollution, as well as making prominent 
mention of his own voting record in this 
area . 

Stull then proceeded to cite numerous 
statistics pointing to the need to curb the 
frightening death rate resulting from 
amounts of sulfer dioxide , carbon 
monoxide and other air pollutants. Yet, 
along the same lines, Stull· seemed to 
admit the impossibility of satisfactorily 
controlling air pollution because of the 
demands by Californians for personal 
vehicles and the social acceptability of this 
sort of pollution. No one wants to give up 
his car as "Californians are an in· 
dependent lot, " and as there has not been a 
suitable rapid·transit system developed 
yet to cope with the problem. 

Stull elaborated upon some of the actions 
now being considered at the state level to 
combat air pollution. A mandatory car 
inspection would insure the possession and 
proper maintenance of anti-pollution 
devices. Also mentioned was a new system 
of automobile license fees graduated 
upwards on the size of the engine, possibly 
to $250 for very large engines and, in ad-
dition , the use of newer pollutant·fr~ 
fuels.

To the Editor : 

The N. Jack Pancake Award 
Committee would like to clarify 
the Award " for Unifying the 
Student Movement" presented to 
John Stull last Friday by the 
Committee. In the past, two 
laureates have been honored with 
"N. Jack Pancake Awards for 
Excellence ," and objection has 
been raised within the committee 
to placing these gentlemen in the 
same class with the Honorable 
Congressman from the BOth 
Dis trict. 

The comm ittee clearly 
di s tinguishes between the 
" awards for excellence," 
granted to these Laureates , and 
the "award " granted to Mr. Stull. 
The latter is merely a statemmt 
of fact, and does not recognize 
any merit , whereas the first, "the 
award for excellence" is CUlf-
fered only when the committee 
feels that some remarkable 
achievement deserves both 
recognition and gratitude. 

Jack Pancake strikes when you 
least expect it!

Ernest W. Mandeville is 
helping UCSD grow. Call him a 
patron, an honorary fellow, a 
benefactor , or whatever, .but no 
matter what you call him! he 
always looks beyonrl thll tiUes 
conferred on him to more and 
better ways of doing things. 

From the first , before anybody 
at UCSD had ever heard of hIm~ 
Mandeville wanted to be on the 
level of what was happening . He 
wasn't interested in the planning 
theories of Regents and chan-
cellors so he went to the provost 
to find' out what was being done 
regarding construction, plan-
ning, etc. The result : he has 
become one of UCSD's most loyal 
supporters. 

He has helped create the 
Mandeville Suite, a resider.ce at 
the top. of Muir 's ~le.ven .story 
dorm, enabling d1stmgu1shed 

visitors such as musician Ernest

EDITOltIALI' 
rvIOLENCE IN AMERICA 

ISLA VISTA, CALIFORNIA 
population 11,250. An unincorporated 
student ghetto. It is managed by the 
Santa Barbara County Government 
pol iced by the 194·man Santa Barbar~ 
County Sheriff's Department, and served 
by 30-odd government entities. None of 
these are under Isla Vista's control. Not 
one of these agencies has an office in Isla 
Vista, where more than 9,000 students 
live in a 1.6 square-mile area that con-
tains more than 400 apartments . 

The Bank of America wants us to 
believe Isla Vista is "all and all, a normal 
American suburban community-per-
haps very much like the one you live or 
work in." We hope not. 

According even to UCSD Vice · 
Chancellor Ray ,Varley, Isla Vista has 
many ghetto .1 ike characteristics: 
transient (student) population, absentee 
landlords, substandard housing, 
inadequate lighting, lack of sidewal ks, 
and drug and theft problems. 

In an ad printed in this week's Triton 
:nm.es ~he Ba~~ of America attempts to 
IU.stlfy Its POSition , yet in doing so deals 
With none?~ these issues. Instead it harps 
on a famll lar theme, namely violence. 
This is a tactic used frequently now, for it 
conveniently clouds the underlying issues 
by appealing to one's popular sentiment. 
After all, who likes violence? 

No one do.es. Yet vi?lence is a daily 
occurrence In our society. Violence of 

st,!gge~ing proportions is taking place 
dally In Viet Nam, but no big cor-
porations that we know of take out fulf 
page ads to deplore that violence. The 
Bank of America, as probably the largest 
financial institution in the country, is by 
no means uninvolved in supporting that 
conflict. However, in the case cf the 
burning of their Isla Vista branch, the 
violence hits home. 

The problems in Isla Vista are deep-
rooted and wi II not come out easily. There 
are community problems that require 
community answers . We deplore the 
violence of Santa Barbara for it has of-
fered no solutions. The Bank of America 
hasn't offered any. The Community 
must. 

The business district consists of a 
couple of gas stations, a few small shops, 
some real estate offices - and a bank. A 
very large and powerful bank . 

The Santa Barbara branch of the Bank 
of America is the largest commercial 
structure in Isla Vista. The Bank has 
used its immense power to buy large 
political advertisements in most of 
California's newspapers, including this 
one. 

Triton Times' policy is to maintain 
open advertising . But we will not allow 
Bank's position to go unrefuted. Their ad 
is very large. Ours, by comparison, is 
very small. We are but one newspaper, 
yet we have decided to take our stand in 
Isla Vista too. 

Galbrait" Library fitting Tribute 
The number of buildings at UCSD 

without names increases almost in linear 
proportion to the number of buildings 
added to the campus each year. Such 
affectionate titles as 2A prime and the 
Undergraduate Sciences Building con -
sistently reassert the lack of identity and 
sense of impermanence that charac-
terizes UCSD's architecture. Little 
separates Argo from conversion to a 
motel, and Humanities Libraty to a 
Department Store . 

The new Central Library is perhaps the 
first bui Iding that someone has endowed 
with a feeling of permanence, a com -
mitment to a lasting university campus . 
This is symbolic, for without a library 
the graduate division and facult ' 
research would have been seriousl; 
curtailed, and the entire academi~ 
structure undermined. This library gives 
UCSD facilities and potential on a level 
shared only by Berkeley and UCLA. 

Former Chancellor John S. GalbraiH 
recognized the need for a major library 
and that no other facilities were available , 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

in the surrounding area. He fought, 
t~reatening to. resign in 1965, to have the 
library established. 

As we said more than two years ago, it 
wo.ul~ be fitting to name the library 
building after Dr . Galbraith because of 
his responsibility for its planning . 

It would be fitting to name the library 
after him because it symbolizes his 
commitment. 

But, regardless of what the name of the 
library is, there ought to be increasing 

~nvolvement by the campus community 
In .th: decision . At UC Berkeley a multi -

~llIlon dollar auditorium, heavily 
financed by student fees, was named 
Zellerbach Hall, despite student efforts to 
name it Martin Luther King Hall. This 
should not happen . 

This editorial should probably be ad-
dressed to the faculty "Committee for 
Naming Streets and Build ings. /I Perhaps 
~o~e of the impermanence of the campus 
IS linked to the lack of involvement of 
students with the permanent functions of 
the university campus.

Schwartz: a Mockery of 
Conservative Thought 

by Dr. Herbert Marcuse 
TO: Dr. Martin N. Olamberlain - Director, University Extension 

I stron~ly protest against the university sponsorship of Dr. Fred 
Schwarz In the course 139X of the Extension Division. 

. Dr. Schwarz is the chief of the soo(!alled "Christian Anti-Commu-
msm Crusade." The pl.~lication, "Danger on the Right" by Arnold 
Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein (1964), sponsored by the Anti-Defa-
mati~n League of B'nai Brith, devotes a whole chapter to Dr. Schwarz, 
to which I refer for docwnentation. It presents him as a hate monger 
and rabble rouser of apparently hysterical stature . The same chapter 
also reports on the way his Crusade is financed. 
. It is of course not only legitimate but also desirable that the univer-

sity offer a course on conservative or rightist thought (in the case of 
Dr. Schwar.z a ~uphemism and misnomer), but I find it intolerable 
that the university stoops to the official sponsorship of hate propa-
ganda. I quote from "Danger on the Right": 

"In the course of his activities he delivers several hundred talks a yur 
mostly to middle·eillSs, middle·aged audiences . The tenor of such 'educa : 
lional' .talks is illustra ted by two of recent Vintage. Alone, he slated as 
an undISputed fact Ihal the Communisl lake-over 01 the United Stales is 
set lor. 1973, a date ~hich al'!"'ost all America ·Slvers have agreed on, and 
proceeded to terrIfYIng detaIls 01 what his listeners laced when Ihe Reds 
seiled power . He grew dramatic, slepped close to Ihe edge of the platform 

~S!f to .bri~g the Reds nearer, and told them that a basic aim of the enemy 
IS to hquldate the bourgeoisie.' 

' II yO~ own shares of common stock, it means you! Now, lifteen million 
Amerocans own common stock! If Ihe Reds win, it means the gallows!' 

AI another meeling, Schwarz 's Reds were evidenlly shorl 01 rope and had 
10. rely on revolvers . Aller working his listeners to the edges 01 their sulS 
WII~ horrendous lales, with the pauses and Ihe sludied emphasis 01 the 

I~a,"ed perlormer, lhe Doctor said: 'When they come lor you ... on a dark 
nlghl, In a dank cellar , and they take a wide bore revolver wilh a soli nose 
bullel , and they place it althe nape 01 your neck .. .' .. (page 49) 
" !"t ~h~eniM ' Arilona, Schwarz said: 'The hour of the ir (the Commu -
nIsts ) Ional conquest draws nur. I think my prediction 01 world conquest 
lor the Communisls lor 1973 was too conservallve . They are running 
ah~ad 01 schedule . There are one billion people in Communisl labora-
I?roes today being organiled and uploited for world conquest. This is six 
tImes the population 01 the United States ... Their Godless doctrine of 

Comm~nism is being taught children at a ratio 01 5 to lover doclrlne, 
.taught In a~y school anywhere ... 11 Communism lakes Ihe world , it will 
be u?restralned . People will be animals, to be disposed ot . I magine them 
comIng for you.' 

At San Francisco he told an audience : ' I believe he (Khrushchev) has 
chosen San Francisco as headquarters 01 the world Communist Diclator· 
shIp. The Mark HO~kins Hotel will make splendid offices for him ... the 
people 01 San FranCISco- those they don't dump in the Bay- can be put in 
Ihe Nevada desert, which is quite handy.' " (page 56) 

The stuff indeed speaks for itself. 
I was told that Dr. Schwarz intends to attack me, and I was asked 
~hether I would appear at his lecture. I like to be attacked if my cri-
tics have read and, preferably, understood my books. This does not 
seem to be the case of Dr. Schwarz as shown by his "exegesis" of 
wha.t ~e thinks .is my phil?SOphy, or that of Marx and Freud (see CAe, 
Chn.stJan An.tJ~on:murusm Crusade, April 1, 1969). I therefore 
dechned the In Vltation. 

I w~~ also told that the university acted " under pressure" in 
orgamzmg the course. Under pressure by whom? Is the university no 
!?nger free or capable of setting up its own courses? If it was indeed 

under pressur~" th.at Dr . Schwarz was given the privilege to speak at 
the I~ad-{)ff sectIOn, It seems that the university, in that deal, agreed to 
prOVide the largest possible forwn for the sort of propaganda 
marketed by Dr. Schwarz. . 

In or~er t? avoid any possible misinterpretation, I repeat : I think 
the univerSity must offer a course on conservative and rightist 
thought, . but I find the selection of some of their self-styled 
protagomsts unworthy of an academic institution 
. I consider the appearance of Dr. Schwarz in a ~iversity course an 
msult t? the intelligence of any serious audience, a mockery of genuine 
education and a mockery of conservative thought. 

One CompanyS Position 

I SLA VISTA, CALIFORNIA, population 11 ,250. The business district consists of a couple of gas stations, a few small shops, some real estate office -
and a bank. A largc campus of the University of 

California is nearby. All in all, a normal American 
suburban community-perhaps very much like the one you 
live or work in. Normal , that is, until Wedne day February 25, 
when violence shattered the peaceful calm of Isla Vi ta o 

At about 8 :30 p.m. on the night of February 25, 
rampaging demonstrators-student and non- tudents-
protesting the "capitali t establishment" converged on the 
community's small bu ine s di trict. 

Several protesters rolled a gasoline-soaked lrash bin 
through a sma hed front door in a Bank of America branch 
and set it ablaze. Other students extinguished the fire. But 
ju t before midnight. with the angry crowd in a frenzy, 
the branch was set ablaze again. While police and fire officials 
were held at bay by a rock-throwing mob, the bank was 
gutted by fire and totally destroyed. A police patrol car was 
overturned and burned. Numerous other fires were tarted. 
Windows were smashed and life and property threatened. 

These events took place in a community called 
Isla Vista. They could have happened in your community. 
They can happen anywhere and with even more 
disastrous results. 

Why did the eruption in Isla Vista take place ? 
Participants in the violence say it was a protest 

against the "capitalist establishment," "the war in Vietnam," 
"the Chicago trial," "student repression," "police brutality," 
and a list of other grievances against America in 1970. 
Some of these grievance are real some are fanciful and 
others are false . But all deserve to be aired. To the degree 
that they are not aired, are not taken seriously, Americans 
break faith with their young. 

But all Americans, young and old, liberal and 
con ervative, 10 e by violence. Violence and destruction are 
the seeds of anarchy and tyranny-whether it be the tyranny 
of the extreme right or the extreme left. 

We believe the time has come for American to unite 
in one cause: a rejection, total and complete, of violence 
as a means of political di sent. 

All of us, young or old, liberal or con ervative, 
\.. l\'~ I too long been silent on the issue of violence. 
We have l)een afraid of labels or slogan that would brand 
us as either arch con ervatives or traitor to a liberal cau e. 
Such sloganeering does all of u a grave injustice. 

Let us, as a nation, find once again our ability to 
distingui h between protest and revolt ; between di sent and 
chaos; between demonstration and de truction ; between 
non-violence and violence. 

Let us cease to condemn tho e who di agree with u , 
but let u al 0 be prompt and re olute in putting an end to 
violence in our land. 

To thi end we applaud the courageou re pon e 
of many dedicated public official. They deserve the 
cooperation of all citizens. They will have our . 

Every American has a right to walk the treet m 
safety. No polemic hould be allowed to ob cure thi right. 
Your wife or husband, son or daughter ought to be afe 
in vi iting a upermarket. a filling tation or a bank-
regardle of whether another may choo e to reject that 
in titution as an onerou ymbol. 

It is for the e rea on that we re-opened our 
Isla Vi ta branch on Monday, March 9 . We realize that 
there'is danger in thi cour e of action. But we believe the 
greater danger to our elve and to all of the people in 
this nation i to be intimidated by mob violence. We refu e 
to be 0 intimidated. 

I the branch worth thi much? In monetary term , 
the an wer is no. It i not , an never ha been particularly 
profitable. But it is there to erve the banking need of the 
community and we refuse to be driven out of an community 
by a violent few. 

Is this a bad bu ines deci ion? Perhap in a narrow 
ense it i . But we believe that at orne time and in omc 

place American must decide whether they intend to ha e 
their deci ion , indeed their live, ruled by a violent minority. 

We are but one bank, but we have decided to take 
our tand in Isla Vi lao

A Nig~t 1~Jjld Town 
ArtsWrlter 

What San Diego needs is a different kind of theater. The Globe and 
the Civic Theater put on some fine productions, but we need something 
to supplement them; we need something to present the off-beat, the 
experimental, the different plays that need doing. It doesn 't have to be 
a large theater , for it will cater to a smaller, more sophisticated 
audience in intimate surroundings. Ideally, the theater should be in a 
romantic locatiOn that makes going to the theater a pleasure. 

We do have such a theater : the Mission Playhouse in scenic and 
historic Old Town. Seating about 75 people, it draws on the best of San 
Diego's semi-professional talent. 

Currently running at the Playhouse is Peter Nichols "Joe Egg," a 
very modern psychological drama concerning a couple trying to cope 
with the oroblems ~enerated by a hopelessly defective child. Dark 
hwnor relieves the tension of the underlying horror. The father 
(James Byrne ) competes with the child for the attention of the mother 
(Flora Richards ), alternately needling her and making sick jokes. In 
fact, he feels he has to compete with every aspect of her life. Miss 
Richards was very good in the role, displaying a mastery of gesture as 
well as voice. Byrne was good as an actor, though he did sometimes 
have trouble with his gestures. Portia Simmons, playing alternate 
nights with Lily Gardner, was convincing as the child. Lillie Mae Bar 
was very good as the husband 's over-motherly mother, a role which 
suited her great talents for comedy. Bill Haylord and Sheila Byrne 
were adequate support as the family friends . 

The action of the play is largely psychological and moral as the 
characters attempt to find a tolerable adjustment. An abortive at-
tempt is made to let the child die . This and other aspects of the play 
follow closely an actual situation involving the playwright's own 
family . It is absolutely not - repeat: not - recommended for 
pregnant women, or women with new-born children. However, those 
interested in psychological and moral problem-solving will find this a 
remarkable play. Not simple entertainment, it is recommended for 
the psychologically sophisticated, and should be of interest to many 
college students. 

It is worthwhile to go the theater early, so one may soak up some of 
the romantic atmosphere of Old San Diego. Lovely parks are nearby, 
and good food and drink are found in an exotic atmosphere .
