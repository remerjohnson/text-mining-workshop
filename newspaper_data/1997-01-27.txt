Foreign Student 
Expelled From OU 
NORMAN, Okla. - Okla-
homa University President 
David Boren has upheld a 
decision expelling Marina 
Yereshenko from the univer-
si ty system, possibly jeopar-
dizing her remaining time in 
the United States. Yereshenko 
was suspended in December, 
after telling an administrator 
she could she cou ld solve her 
problems with a gun after a 
sexual-harassment claim she 
filed was dismi sed. Although 
she later said she was joking, 
the Campus Disciplinary 
Council suspended and 
ultimately expelled her. In 
early January, Immigration 
amI Naturaliiation Services 
took her into custody for 10 
days because the suspension 
violated her visa requirements.

COMMUNITY: Program aims to 
help underrepresented, low-

By Leena Shankar 
Staff Writer 

In a first step toward ' improving upon crime 
rates and low college-attendance ligures, San 
Diego's Perkins Elementary School and the Col-
lege Kids Foundation opened its doors to the 
Barrio Logan Elementary Institute. 

UCSD students arc dosely involved with thi s 
project as mentors, and Marshall College De'lIl 
Rafael Hernandez is a project board member. 

The Institute is a non-profit organization, in-
tended to provide support and al:ademil: help to 
underrepresented and economically-di 'advan-
taged third-, fourth- and fifth-grade students. 

"There are three main components to the pro-

gram," Hernandez said. "The kids atlend an after-
school program twice a week, during which UCSD 
students, as well as junior high and high ~choo l 
kids. provide academil: tutoring along with hands-
on activities ." 

The program also includes a parent-involve-
ment component provides parenting workshops 
and dasses. Outside professionals work with the 
children through the mentor program. 

Hernandez said the program is a good way for 
UCSD students to get involved with the commu-
nity , and meshe well with the Marshall College 
philosophy. 

"We need tu do more in terms of outreach 
efforts and work with the educational commu-
nity," Hernandez said. "There are very bright 

~tudents here who serve as excellent role model!> 
for elementary school students."

According to Lytic, the assembly canl:e1eu

An announcement from the 
Oakland Board of Educ.:ation on 
Dec. I X raised the spew:r that this 
hypothetical student 's answer 
would <lctually he comilkred <.:or-
recl. The ho;mJ vuiced its intent to

Yet, in thi~ ru~h to judglllcnt, many 
or the suhtleties ami hroader impli -
,at ions of th~ i,sue ha ve heen over-
looked. 

Although the question of 
whether Ehonics is a language or a 
dialect has evoked a lot of emotion, 
il is essentially a non-issue. While 
the hroad consensus is that Ehonics 
is little more than poor English, 
trying to detcrmine if a diale<.:1 is a 
distinct language serves only to 
rellect the ideological predisposi-
tion of those trying to incorporate 
Ehonics. Whether Ehonics is a dis-
linct language is a suhjec.:tive and 
sometimes political decision. . 

The most honest stalement 
cO llles from lingui st Mal( 
Weinreich: "A language is a dialect 
wilh an army and a navy," We can 
leave thi s debate to the linguists, 
For policy purposes, it is enough to 
note th ,l t Ehonics is internally c.:on-
sistent, and that it is in sOllle ways 
gramlmlli<.:ally simpler than stan-
dard English, anti that people speak 
it he<.:ause it is whal they have 
leamed. 

These fu,ts form the useful core 
or the Ebonic issue. Tl!<lchers need 

To a growing 
degree, people are 
backing away from 
the Idea of living 
together, and 
Instead are turning 
to the Idea of self

way they learned to speak. If tea<.:h-
ers recognile the origins of tlleSt: 
differences from standard English, 

they will be better prepared to 
explain them to students. 

So far, nonc of thi s sounds terri-
bly c.:onlrovcrsial. Why Ihen all the 
uproar ovcr the Oakland announce-
ment '! 

The prohlcm with Oakland's 
approach came in their argument 
"thai I Ehonics is J genetically based 
and not a dialect of English .... " The 
hoard 's pusitiun 011 the dialect 
issue W:IS an allempt to secure fed -
eral funds reserved for teaching 
native speakers of other languages 
but not of other dialects. 

The real problem with this Slale-
ment was the assertion that any lan-
guage has geneti<.: origins. While 
c.:apacily for language is, in general, 
geneti <.:a ll y basctl, it is more or less 
equally dislributed among all 
humans. Particular languages arc 
simply products of certain <.:uitures. 
"Genetically based" seems to be a 
choi<.:e of words more appropriate 
to a white suprelllacistthan a group 
ostensibly trying to help bla<.:k stu-

dents. 
The second prohlem was the 

hoard 's proposal 10 begin "instruct-
ing Afric.:an American children both 
in their primary language 
[Ebonics] and in English." The 
language used to teach children is a 
critical mailer. They need to be 
taught through good examples. 
Only by hearing standard English 
spoken in all classes can they learn 
to speak it c.:o rre<.:tly. 

I was surpri sed when I realized 
thal I had experience relevant to 
this issue. Though my white, sub-
urban upbringing did not lead me 
to speak Ebonics, I had to deal with 
many similar issues while learning 
Russian at UCSO - a language 
substantiall y different from 
English in grammar and senten<.:c 
structure. 

One major differenc.:e is, thc 
complete absen<.:e of u present 
tense form of the verb "to he." 
There is simply no such thing. We

SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARTICLE TRIVIALIZED ISSUE 
Editor: 

Your editorial doesn 't get the 
point about the suhjec.:t it purports 
to address ("Sex ual Harassment 
Policy Respec ts Right uf the 
Accused," GLiardia" , Jan. 16, 
1997). Sexual harassment involves 
professors hudgering their stutlent 
for sex, leac.:hing assistants making 
unwanted physica l advances on 
sludents and studenls spying on 
woman in bathroom stalls. We are 
not talking about an innocent "pat 
on the shoulder" or "overhearing a 
fellow employee tell a bawdy 
joke," Wh:u is at issue is women's 
safety on this campus and women 's 
right to be here without being sub-
jec.: tto sexual harassment. The sa ('e-
ty of women is not enhanc.:ed when 
the administration and its apolo-
gists seek to cover up or laugh off 
the problem, 

To pooh-pooh sexual harass-
ment as some nugatory "calise 
cefebre" pushed by those who have 
"particular axes to grind" is an 
unacceptable and outrageous insult 
to women who have to submit to 
the reality of the maller, somcthing 
the editorial writer seems to he in 
denial over. it may he helpful for

be sufli cient for (;ommuniL:ation, 
languagc ha~ olher uses. It serves 
as a broader signal of a person's 
education. Rather than asking for a 
person 's full academic pedigree, 
you can form a fair estimate based 
on his usc of language. Only by 
lea rning standard English can

~ I aves <.:reated a new language - an 
ahbreviated form of English that

brilliant and admirable. 

The failure to recognize Ebonies

Americans. Ebonic, is a legi timate 
languagc. Any t.:1'fort to make it 
seem like anythi(lg else is an assault 
on African·Amerkan culture, eth-
nici ty and (;ommunity. 

The concept that success is only 
achieved upon the abandonment of 
one's community has prevai led for 

ety 's ranks. 
Few would dispute the need to 

learn standard English in this coun-
try. The queslion then is how best 
to leach it, and here is where the 
issue broadens beyond Ebonies. 
The old way of learning English 
was through immersion. People 
came to this country and learned 
Engli sh because they needed to. 
Chi ldren were instructed in 
Eng li sh. They were surrounded ~y 
the language, and eventually they 
spoke it.

guage while learning English. on

lack of Iluen(;y in engli sh. The real-

they art.: " Ie~s hlack" is because they 
have assimilated into American 
society as qui(;kly as possible and 
abandoned the wlllmunities frolll 
which they L:arne. 

Success for African Americans 
requires not only that they learn 
standard English, bul that they also 
embrace thos~ parts of their cullUl c 
and (;ommunity that make them dis-
tinct. The unwillingness of Ebonies' 
t.: riti <.:s to adopt a system of teaching 
thatmilY propel a greater number of 
people of (;olor toward positions of 
power can onl y be seen as a last-
ditch effort to preserve the exclusive 
"old hoys" network. 

worse by the fact that school is 
often the only place these (;hildren 
are exposed to standard English. 

Language is interesting in that it 
is very easy to learn when young, 
but relatively hard t~ learn aner a 
certain age. Children need to be 
expo ed to English - standard 
Englih - as early and as often as 
possible. Teachers neell to under-
sland the additional complications 
of teaching students with different 
grammatica l backgrounds, but they 
must also serve as good linguistiL: 
examples. 

We, as a society, have 10 set,the 
educat ional bar high and dcmand 
good performance. Children will 
live up 10 these expcclations. By 
lowering standards in a quest to 
promote "self esteem ," we will 
si mply ensure that future genera-

Monday, January 27, 1997 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 7 

MECHA CANNOT HIDE ACTIONS FROM MEDIA 
Editor: 

I would like to express my con-
dolences at the shortsightedness 
and itliocy thaI you people have 10 
put up with in your daily lives as 
journalists. I woultl like to say that 
the Mem Direc/i va has made some 
invalid and egregious mistakes in 
its response to you. I try Ilotto crit : 
idze opi nion , but when it comes to 
this cou ntry that I love, I can ' t hclr 
hut expres~ some heliefs that 1 
have about the way this pla(;c 
shoultl be run. 

First, whi le I am glad th ey 
acknow ledged the right of newspa-
pers to puhlish news and di ssemi -
nate information to the pUb li c, I 
am surpri ed that they were upset 
at you presenting the facts. From 
what I understand (and can 
remember), you guys showed a 
picture of MEChi stas who werc 
hurning a flag . Why the 
MEChistas wou ld get upset over 
you printing that , and Ihen di s-
cussing the MEChistas on campus 
is absurd. The lasl time I checked, 
they were all part of the same 
organiz3ticn. 

Secondly, the Mesa Direcf;vu 
comes out firing saying that it is 
your (and lhe rest of the media's) 
fault that people on campus and in 
Ihe U.S. have Ihis perception of 
them. Then. why did they burn the 
American nag? Don' l they under-
stand that burning and de$troying 
an American icon will draw media 

allention'! 
Moreover, they go on to say 

that your newspaper is maintain-
ing the "margi nality of 
Chicanos/a ' and Latinos/as by 
emphasizing the polemic issue or 
flag burning, whil:h diverted the 
focus of what the march was 
altelllpti ng to address: 'equal 

. a(;cess to the institu tions or thi s 
country that racis t. sexist exclu-
sionary pOlicies have not perm it -
ted ... · This is unbelievahle! I I' 
hurni ng the flag di vertcd the issue , 
th en why on eart h did you do it'! 
What docs flag-burning have to do 
wilh equal access to this nation's 
instituti ons'! (This docs sound 
ovcr-innaled to me: whal federal 
institulions arc you talking about , 
or do you mean commercial insti-
tutions'!) 

Anybody who takes hold of 
such powerful symbo li sm like they 
did should be aware of its polential 
10 run away from you. Besides, 
why would you burn a Ilag in pub-
lic and then attempt "to block it 
from the news camera behind them 
so that the media would nO! exploit 
Ihe situation". "'! ) cannot comment 
on the uncanny ability of media to 
exploit volalile situations like this, 
but MOChA is naive 10 Ihink thai 
burning a flag behind journalists 
would a,void gelling media cover-
age ... 

I think those who were respon-
sib le wanted to gel recognized and

that is why Ihey did it in public. If 
you do it in puhlic, then you arc 
pUlling yourself in the news. 

The fact that they now blame 
internal strife on thi s iOl:idenl 
should serve as a warning 10 them 
that there may be different faclions 
within Ihe organizalion. Some 
obviously have more mililant or 
radical ideas, and would partici-
pale in protests involving flag-
burning, whereas others are more 
focused on personal and less pol it-

ical problems and would rather 
avoid such visua lly loud displays 
to get Iheir point across. I hclieve 
that the facl that many memhers of 
the MEChistas "knew nothing 
ahout" th is incidcnt is so lid cvi-
dem:e of such dissension amon!! 
the ranks. Further I helicve that Ih~ 
Guardian need not <.:hanl!e its style 
of journ,IIism, Ilor dO':S it owe 
UCSD MEChA an apology. I hopc 
that when peoj1k read this they 
don 'l make hasty aS~Lll11ptinns

they jll~t lJlllJcrstand thc olher ~ide

Tougher Punishment 
Not Reducing Crime 
Editor: 

As much as I can understand 
the anger of Fred Goldman and his 
urge to see murderers punished. I 
think his recipe for j ustice is exact-
ly whallhis country does not need, 
Compared to ailihe other industri -
alized counlries, the U.S. already 
has a disproportionalcJy large 
inmate populalion, 'but it doesn't 
seem to be solving any problems. 

America refuses to a(;knowl. 
edge that criminality is first and 
foremollt . a social problem, and 
that the only radical cure must be 
done at the rools : changing Ihe 
soc ial substralum in which crime 

develops. Building prisons and 
toughening sentences is not goi ng 
to work. 

If you look al Ihe expcricn<.:es 
of other countrie~ . you will nOlice 
that thc countries with thc most 
Ienienl justice systems arc abo the 
countri es with Ihe lowest criminal -
it y. Lowering the perceived rower 
of de terrent did nut resu lt in a l11a,-
sivc crimc wave. It scelllS that 
IfIcasurl!S like Ihc inJ'amous "th rce 
~I rikes" law acw 'll1y im:reasc the 
level or desperation of crillllnals, 
their urge not to get L:aught and . 
ultimately. their readiness to n:~()rt 
to violence. After all. if you arc 
going to he scnli.:nced 10 life in 
prlSun just for ~ t ealing a slice of 
pizza, you might as well kill thl.! 
policeman who's trying to arre~t 
you. 

Social outre<lch is Ihe only 
delini li ve answer to crime. We 
sh()uld follow Ihe example of 
countries like Swed.:n ur Denmark 
- not (as we arc now doing) Iran, 
Iraq or Libya. 

Reasonably lough senlences arc 
obviously necessary. but overly 
sc vere mca.,urcs will not redu(;e or 
eradicale crime. Prison should be u 
chance for reh,tbilitalio~ , not 
revenge. As mucli as I can uNlcr-
sianci lhe desire for revenge..on the 
pan 01' victims' families, I don', 
think Ihis should he Ihe goal of the 
justice syslelll.

Marshall Student Commits 
Suicide in his Apartment 
TRAGEDY: Seth 
Mirsky was only son 
of UCSD librarian 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Seth Mirsky, a Marshall Col-
lege junior, died Thursday in the 
lower Marshal I Apart ments . He was 
20 years o ld. 

Mirsky was last 'een alive at 
2:30 p.m. by his roommate, who 
relurned at 5 p_m., finding Mirsky 
unconscious. 

The roommate cal led 911 . Para-
medics were unabl e to revive 
Mirsky, and he was pronounced 
dead al the scene al 5:40 p.m. 

Mirsky allcnded UC Berkeley 
for a semester hefore transferri ng 
10 UCSD in Spring 1996, He par-
ticipated in UCSD's Early Aca-
demic Honors program, taking 
dasses at UCSD while still in high 
school. 

Acwrding to Marshall College 
Dean Rafael He rna m./cz, Mirsky 
came to UCSD wilh Illorc than a 

ye~truf Adv~lI1ced Pl:u.:emem credit. 
He had excellent grades and was on 
the Prnvost's Honor~ list , 

Mirsky 's dealh, by asphyxiation, 
is being treated as a suicide by 
UCSD police investigalors. There 
were no signs of a struggle, forced 
entry or other foul play. 

Although Mirsky was being 
tre:J ted fordepres~it>n, and Marshal I 

Resident Dean Yolanda Trevino 
said her staff was in daily contact 
with him , she said she did not sus-
pect he was considering suicide. 

An au topsy was conducted Fri -
day, although the results are sli II 
unavailable, and a toxicology reo 
port is pending. 

"It's a reallragic situalion, espe· 
cia lly involving a student , and a 
student whose mother is employed 
hcrc," UCSD Dctcctive Sergeant 
Robert Jones said. 

Phyllis Mirsky, the deputy uni -
vcrsity librarian, has been a library 
employee for more than 20 years. 

"A II of the library staff's 
thoughts and prayers are with 
.Phyllis and Ed at thi s time," Uni· 
versi ty Librarian Gerald Lowell 
said. 

Mirsky was the couple's only 
child. 

According to Jones, the last sui-
cide on campus occurred over the 
1996 July 4 weekend at the Mesa 
Apartments across Interstate 5. 

The victim, a gradua'tc student, 
was apparently despondent over an 
unsuccessful relationship. 

Jones said Ihe campus has wit · 
nes 'ed between 12 and 14 suicides 
si nce he arrived 17 years ago. 

UCSD Psychological and Coun· 
seli ng Services Director John 
Giebink urged any students having 
problems coping with Mirsky's 
death to c:J1I or StOP in for counsel-
ing.

:nodem SUVs is aimed at a niche 
all its own. 

The Durango is based on the 
aggressive ly-styled Dakota pick-up 
and offers standard four-wheel 
drive (a two-wheel-drive version 
will come on line in 1999) and a 
3.9 liter V-6. Two V-8s arc 
optional, as well as a third-row 
bench scat that allow~ seating for 
eight. 

Sport-utility vehicles tend to be 
gas-guzzlers and poor handlers, 
and orten wrne equipped with sub-
par hrakes. The buying public's 
fascination with these flawed. 
albeit functional , vehicles remains 
a mystery to many car buffs. Let's 
face it : they ' re trucks - designed 
for hauling heavy loads and 
durability in the face of extreme 
conditions. They do have two 
things going for them. however -
they arc practical. and they have a 
cert:lin brutish style that appeals to 
many. 

Another vehicle style that has 
become wildly popular in the last 
decade is the minivan. Many of our 
generation consider minivans an 
abomination. and not without good 
reason - as children, they suffered 
the traumatic experience of being 
stuffed into the back of one. 

General Motors has introduced 
a trio of minivans - the Chevrolet 
Venture, the Pontiac TranSport and 
the Oldsmobile Silhouette - sure 
to strike fear into the heart!i of 
people under 25. With sliding doors 
available on both sides, a 3.4 liter 
lBO-horsepower V-6 engine and 
gobs' of ~pace, these vehicles arc 
immensely practical as people and 
cargo-haulers. 

Not to be outdone by the 
practicality of its rivals, GM has 
included a class-leading 17 
cupholders and 26 storage bins in 
each of the trio. The end i near my 
friends - you, too, will soon be 
shulliing rugrats around in one of 
these vehicles.

WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE BOMBING OF ABORTION CLINIcs? 
Interviews by Prlya Honeyman • Photography by Ethan Schreiber 

I tot a II y support the 
protest against abortion. I 
am Christian and I believe 
it's all designed by God. I 
mean, it's a little human 
being, I believe. I think 
there should be no abor-
tion . I am totally, totally 
against abortion. 

Taking the life of any-
thing is wrong ... I adhere 
to biblical fundamentals, 
but I don't believe In 
bombing abortion clinics. 
You can't legislate moral i-
ty. You set a good example 
and hope that other people 
will want to see what's dif-
ferent about you. They're 
as guilty as everybody else 
if they kill - you're 
affecting not only one life, 
but now you're affecting 
hundreds of others. 

I'm disturbed that the 
people who are pro-life 
would take life, and that 
they don '( hold by their 
saying that life is essential, 
and they don't really value 
life. 

I tend to think that abor-
tion is a choice. It 's a 
moral choice. It's not 
clearly defined to every-
one and therefore there 
should be debates. And 
while bombing and all that 
stuff is wrong and\wiolence 
is wrong, the idea that we 
should be talking about 
this stuff is definitely cor-
rect. 

We don't have a right to 
say whether someone can 
or cannot choose. When 
women are raped, I think 
that abortion is okay. I'm 
very pro-choice. No one 
has the right to rule that 
people's freedoms should 
be limited. The bombings 
are contradicting [pro-lif-
ers'] own philosophy. 
They're saying we should 
be pro-life, yet when they 
are bombing, someone is 
going to be hurt. It's a con-
tradiction.

of UCLA at Warren West Field, 
the rugge rs came out on lOp, 29-5. 

Aaron Smilh , Shamus Brown,

Ward Wilsey scored tries for the 
home squad en roule to I he domi -

"We were dominating them for

"Now that we are linally play-

The Di vision 11/ Challenge co-
incided with the UCS D Spirit 
weekend and. thus, featured an 
A lumni meet and also an Inter-
cu llegiate meet in which athletes 
rrom other U SD sport s were 
in vited to swim relays ag ain ~t 
each other. 

The Intercolleg iate Re lay saw 
the combined team of men's vol -
ley hall and women 's basketball 

take home the victory, wi th the 
majority o r the ath leles showing 
c)(act ly why they compete on dry 
1:1nd. 

"We had u lot of fun- all of 
the teams di d- it was a rea ll y 
good competition eve n though it

The Triton's nex t scheduled 
event is Ihe Conference Champi-
onship meet in mid-February. 
There they will allemptto qualify

PWCKED: Feeding off a raucous Spirit Night crowd of UCSD faithful, the lady hoopsters whooped Christian Heritage, 77-59 
By TravIs Hili 
Staff Writer 

Home is where the heart is. 
Home is where you hang your 

hal. 
Home is also where you de-

s troy your opponents, and thaI is 
exactly what the UCSD women's 
basketball team did last Frid"y in 
s panking C hri stian Heritage Co l-
lege, 77-59. The Tritons tr ium -
phanl return home was made even 
sweeter by the fael thm it was 
Spiril Night at R[MAC arena , and 
over 500 face-painted, fl ag-wav-
ing maniacal fans turnell out in 
support. 

Although the Tritons won by 
18 points, the scrappy vi sitors 
would not go away without a fighl, 
CUlling an early first-half double-
digit UCSD lead to only three, 32-
29 at the halfway point. 

"Coming home to Spirit Ni ght 
was great ," Head Coach Judy 
Malone said . "Butlthink the huge 
amount of fan s made the girls a 
lillie nervous. I think that' s why 
[i n the first half] our shots weren' t 
falling. " 

The Ladyhawks stayed in the 
game due to the post play of 6-
foot - I junior Jennie Griffin , one 
of the best players in the NAIA. 
Griffin was the obvious focus of 
the Christian Heritage game plan. 
The Ladyhawks tried to pound Ihe 
ball inside to her all game, know-

senior forward Karli Jungwirth . 
Th e Ladyhawks' plan was 

large ly successful - Griffin led 
both teams with 25 points and 12 
boards. 

But in Ihe second half, Malone 
co unt e red Ch ris tian 
Heri tage ' s one-dimensional 
offc,nse with an intricate and 
multi -faceted game plan . 

The first part called for 
the elimination of the easy 
pass into the post with con-
stant pressure from Cindy 
Yamasaki , Krista Poehler 
and Jenessa Bayda on Chrislian 
Heritage ' s younger guards. The 
Ladyhawk playmakers were obvi-
ously uncomfortable with such 
defense, as the Tritons forced 22 
turnovers . 

The ne&t part of Malone's strat -
egy was to confuse Griffin by ing 
her with a constantly changing cast 
of character . Anne Westmoreland, 
Sarah Schneider, Pam Contini , Sum-
mer Beg[ey, Tianna Meriage and 
even the injured Jungwirth all had 
shots at stopping the Ladyhawks ' 
only weapon. Malone's plan worked 

was also huge on the offensive 
end, leading th~ Tritons with 15 
points. 

In the ab ence of Jungwirth, 
Schneider was inserted into the 
starling lineup. where she proved 

that she he longs hy fi ghling 
for every rebound. Clean-
ing up the offensi ve glass 
for the Tritons all nighl , 
Schneider lead the team in 
rebounds, and the majorilY 
of her 12 points came from 
second-chance shots. 

Bayda al so chipped in on 
the offen i ve end, hitting two big 
three-pointers ~n the second half 
on her way to '12 points. 

But the big surprise was the 
play of Begley. Although she was 
in the game for only 12 minutes, 
she made the best use of her time, 
scoring 10 points and providing 
dynamite post defense. 

"Summer did a great job," 
Malone said. "It was her first game 
back since her [broken fingerJ, and 
she played outstanding defense in 
the post."

THE CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMl 

Super Bowl: PO T~ 
It's about ads 

I remember a time. A time 
of happines and joy. A time 
spent enjoying the most 
astonishing and incre~ible 
sights of Super Bowl Sunday. 
The commercials. 

Spirited Win Keeps Hope Alive 
FANFARE: Before 1,300 faithful, UCSD captur~d an important win to improve its playoff chances 

But ruthlessly and savagely, 
this yeady display of advertis-
ing executives' creativity has 
been taken away from me. I 
can no longer rely on seeing 
the great Bud Bowl wars. No 
more ingenious advertise-
ments. Instead, I had to suffer 
through unoriginal , boring 
commercials. The only bright 
spot was the star-studded Nike 
ad featuring the always-
hilarious "Lillie Penny." 

In previous years, I longed 
for a stoppage in play. It was a 
chance for me to witness cool 
frogs chilling at the bayou or a 
kid being Slicked through a 
certain cola hOllle that starts 
with P and ~nds with I. 

But no more. 
As of yesterday afternoon, 

the only a~pect of the Super 
Bowl that' cver to enjoyed 
watching was dead, as we all 
know - a~ , correctly 
predictcd two weeks ago - the 
final result of the game is 
merely an alter-thought.

The Tritons were up to the tas k, 
licking the Chapman Panthers by 
a score of 91 -83. Following the 
same reci pe for success they ' ve 
been usi ng all season, the men 
once again sent packing a team 
that appeared taller, stronger and 
more talented. 

Guard Mike Wall continued to 
step up his ga me, scoring 26 points 
to lead all players. Hilling trom 
downtown as well as go ing to the 
basket , the versatile Wall also 
pulled down to 

bounds, seven of them on the of-
fensive end of the court. Mean-
while, Mike Thimgan continued 
to provide offense, bombing fro", 
downtown to fini sh the game with 
17 point s, while Dan Almquist and 
Nick Maroutsos provided an es-
sential spark off the bench. 

Playing eve ry game for their 
playoff li ves, the men opened the 
game quickly as usual. A patient 
offense, with players making the 
ex tra passes necessary for solid 
'hots, starl ed the game, as the Tri -
tons worked the hall inside and 
out. 

Playing with the confidence of 
a team on a ro ll , and parked by a 
couple of three-poi n't baskets, the 
men soon jumped out to a double-
digit lead. Though the Panthers 
made a run while some UCS D 
starters rested, the men nonethe-
less hit the halfway mark with an 
eight -poi nt lead. 

The second half was a bailie, as 
Chapman used every player on 
their 14-man roster in an effort to
