of this law, the finanCIal aid

Honesty is 
the best policy 

Let's tell the truth more often. 
Already orne readers are rolling their eyes and 

thinking, "Oh, God, here comes another corny 
editorial suggestion," or are starting to flip through 
the paper to the Doonesburys, but try to stick around 
for this one, there might be something to be learned . 

It might seem a ridiculous suggestion to tell the 
truth. It might be so obvious that one may feel it 
doesn't have to be said. That sort of thinkin~ is 
bUllpuckey. It should be said all the time and with 
meaning, because honest words never hurt, and for 
words that isn't bad at all. 

Trying truth will invariably freak some people out. 
If you are honest with what you say, how you feel, one 
might think you rude instead of being simple. But 
avoiding the moves and countermoves of the social 
game will put you ahead in the long run; people will 
know that they can trust you, even if it i to hear 
things that they might not want to. 

A brother says to a sister, "J love you," and it stuns 
her to speechlessness. It isn't that she didn't know 
that her brother loved her untIl he saId It; she always 
knew it. It is just that by saying such a thing it brings 
to surface the reality of someone caring about her, 
making her understand completely and without a 
doubt. 

It ' like looking at a fire from a distance and 
knowing that it is warm, but then someone brings 
that fire close to you to let you feel the warmth, the 
light, the glow: the reality. It is the sublime brought to 
to the surface to be seen, and it may be obvious, but 
it's still wonderful nonetheless. 

Think of all the good it would dol Think of what all 
the confusing, mind·bending fog that would be lifted 
by saying what is on one's mind. No more wondering 
where you tand with everyone, but instead knowing 
exactly what your ituation is, where you can go for 
help and where you can't. Could we ever dig uch a 
thing as honesty, telling people to "bugger off" 
instead of churning out, "Have a nice day"? Could we

I hate standardized tests 
BY PETER MORTENSON 
Plainly stated, [ hate 

standardized tests. Starting in 
kindergarten, I remember 
re enting having my intelli· 
gence measured by a set of 
seemi ngly arbitrary and 
irrelevant questions. As r grew 
older, I learned that the 
question were not intended as 
arbitrary and irrelevant and 
that they only appeared that 
way as a means of extracting 
from me some measure of my 
academic aptitude . That 
didn't help any, because [ still 
had a healthy dislike for the 
PSAT and the SAT in high 
school. When [ entered UCSD 
over three years ago, I 
assumed that that would be 
the end of my experience with 
standardized tests. I had no 
idea that the worst was yet to 
come. 

This summer [ watched a 
roommate and several friend 
prepare for the Medical 
College Admissions Test. 
Another prepared for the Law 

chool Admis ions Te t. 
Other people whom I don't 
know pre umably spent some 
time cramming for the 
Graduate Management 
Admissions Test. [ attempted , 
without success, to methodic· 
ally and carefully prepare 
myself for the Graduate 
Record Exam. All of these tests 
are different, and the MCAT is 
admittedly less abstract than 
the LSAT or the GRE, but the 

fact remains that academic life 
beyond the undergraduate 
level is intimately associated 
with more standardized 
testing. 

Now, I realize that GRE 
scores are only part of what is 
considered in an application to 
graduate study. Still, how you 
perform on the GRE must to a 
certain extent determine 
whether you study literature 
at Berkeley or an Diego State. 
More can be said for the 
importance of the LSAT in 
selectmg students for the few 
top echelon law schools in the 
country; the same, almost to 
an extreme, is true of the 
MCAT and the "best" medical 
schools. 

It is reasonable to assume 
that admissions officers at 
graduate schools, law schools, 
business school and medical 
schools need a "constant" to 
which they can compare an 
individual's localized schola -
tic achievement. A 3.8 GPA at 
one institution may be 
equ ivalent to the 3.7 of 
another; the potential for 
scholarly achievement may 
not neces arily be demon tra-
ble in institution of greater 

st udent populations as 
compared to the opportunities 
in smaller chools. No doubt 
standardized tests were 
created as a reference by 
which to gauge the greater or 
lesser significance of personal 
achievement. 

But somewhere, something 
went wrong. Whether implied 
or expressed t he message from 
post·undergraduate acadamia 
rings painfully clear : 
standardized testing is 
Important in and of itself. 
Student. panic months ahead 
of test administration dates, 
doing all kinds of things to 
relieve their anxiety, Test 
preparat ion schools overflow 
with the nervous who can 
afford to have their fears 
allayed by constant instruc· 
tion and practice In test-taking 
stralegies. Others buy test 
books which also aim at 
bolstering vocabulary and 
exam kills. 

The bottom line is that test 
preparation has become as 
important as the te. t itself, 
simply because "everyone" is 
doing it (or at lea t a 
ignificant num ber to have an

"'Thras like losin' a friend the day 
George Killian stopped brewin' the Red:' 
fA n old friend if you IJ ask me For nearly a hundred years, the 

lads all over this 
part of Ireland knew you 
could count on the Red And 
count on the Red they did. 

"Itwas George Killian's 
family who brewed it. And 
for five generations they 
was holdin ' true to the taste. 
And if you ever had just a 
sip or two for yourself. you'd 
thank 'em for it. too. 

"But then came the black 
day George Killian stopped 
brewin'the Red Some say it 
was the changin times that 
backed him to the wall 

. Modernize thev said 
to George 

.. C~)mprorrll"'(> Gcorg~ 
said to them And III have 
none of that. Before I change the taste, III 
close the door 

And close the doors he did-though a 
-few of the lads came close to tears. And 
George Killian came close to tears, himself. 
Or so they say. 

"Then somethinggrand happened. 
Over in America , Coors asked George 
if they could help him bring it back. 

.. 'Brew me Killian 's Red?'George 
asked 'Aye, I'd be proud to brew 
with you. If you be brewin it HlLJ way 

"Now Georges way was never 
the easy way It me2ns slow-roaslin' 
the malts Takin ' a bit more time 
And a bit more trouble 

.~~ . iI... ~~ 
But that's what bri ngs out the taste And 

thats v .. hdt brings out the gloriOUS red c('lor 
'And I hear that's just the way they're 

doin ' it. One sip, they say, and you 'll know 
they're brewin ' it George's way. Of course, 

brewin' the Red 
George's way is just 
what the lads all 
expected. 

"They dont for-
get what George 
Killian always 
says:'''1 stopped 
brewin ' it once 
And I can stop it 
again.

6 Tht.' I 'C~ I) Guardian Odol)(',· I I. I HH~ 

A Controversial Letter 
Being commissioner of Public Relation, I must relate to the public (no pun 

intended) what the AS Council is really about. The e are three political factions on 
this campus; left, center and right (new indicator, students, and California Review) 
while it certainly seems to me thallhe majority of the students belong to the center 
or fairly' apolitical, they are also the most neglected by the AS Council. 

Those of you out there who couldn't care less about anything but , for example, 
studying and having a good time are being overlooked. The left, a minority on 
campus, is a very cohesive group that is extremely vocal and therefore effective. 
They currently are dividing up most of your student money allocated to the AS 
imply because they ask for it. 
Why doe only 12%of UCSD's student body turn out to vote year after year? Why 

are mainstream publication only receiving 4% of media funds? I constantly hear 
complaint by students that the social life i terrible, that we need more 
programming space, that there are not enough TGs. and why i n 't there a bu iness 
or law school. Well kids, it's time for all of you who care about these issues and other 
similar one to make your presence felt. If you don't vote, don 't come toAS meetings 
or at least do not read the Guardian, then don't complain about problem which you 
could do something about. 

Please take a little time and write a letter to the AS Bulletin expressing your 
opinion of this campu and its deficiencies. By the way, next time you are talking to 
someone from Phy . Ed ., a k why the Clash, the Blasters and Adam and the Ants 
are nol coming to UCSD. Plea e people, get involved a little. Apathy contribute too 
much to our attrition rate. 
Thank you very much.

very funny ... 

(and many people don't), then you should submit 
short, funny, off-the·wall article, pictures, and 
drawings to Marc Geiger in the AS offices. See it in 
the AS Bulletin. Get Funny!!!

contil' ucd from page 1 

Davenport emphasized the 
future need for more parking, 
especially with the influx of 
new students and rising 
enrollment. 

Presently, the problem lies 
more 10 the fact that people 
don't want to walk that far, 
than in the availability of 
parking. "The Third parking 
lot , beyond the Th i rd 
apartments, is never full," 
aid Davenport. "The problem 

is in the inner lots." 
Thus, Da\'enport at tacked 

the heart of the parking 
problem by expanding one of 
the closest lots. HIs idea seems 
to be spreading to other 
campuses, like Third , which IS 
now co nSid e rin g .;i mil ar 
changl''' 10 its lots.

That's right! 

Davenport's accompli sh· 
ment is one to be admired . Last 
year , a only a freshman , he 
helped convince the admini· 
tration of the parking 

inadequacie he aw . " I 
wanted to do what was best for 
Muir College," he 'aid, and 
stre sed how "important it 
was to get involved." 

Davenport told of other 
colleges, like UCLA, where 
there really is a parking 

. problem ,and where freshmen 
often don't even get parking 
permits. 

"Considering the size of this 
campus, a fairly efficient use 
of parking space has been 
made," Davenport said 
"However. there 1'; always 
room for imprO\'eml'nt .

With education and living 
costs rapidly soaring out of 
site, many stu dents are 
turning to motorcycles to hold 
down transportation ex pen· 
ses. Cal Trans recently 
reported that motorcycles are 
proving to be very economical 
to operate. "the fleet average 
for motorcycle is about 65 
miles per gallon while the fleet 
average for automobiles is 
about 17 miles per gallon," 
said Joe Mariner, Motorcycle 
Coordinator for Cal Trans. 

The San Diego Motorcycle 
afety Council has seven 

motorcycle training sites in 
San Diego County. "One thing 
most people don't realize," 
SaId John Madden. coordinator 
for the COLI nci I' s Mot orcycle 

Training Program, "is that 
r iding a motorcycle is not like 
riding a bicycle or driving a 
car. Riding a motorcycle takes 
special kills. and trying to 
learn them in traffic IS very 
dangerou s. That's one of the 
reasons beginning riders are 
involved in more than half of 
all motorcycle accidents." 

The seven Motorcycle 
Train ing Programs provide 
loaner motorcycles in 
Coronado, EI Cajon, Escondi· 
do, Kearny Mesa, SDSU. the 
Sports Arena area, and at 
Southwestern Community 
College.

Police beat 
BY RENATA Kl:NGYS 

Meeting for alcoholic's families 
Service geared toward students 

All hough !'chool has been m 
session only two \H'eks. the 
campus Police Depart men t 
has .drl'adv filed man\' 
report s. Thei'r most common 
problems are those concerning 
parking permlt~, aCl'Idents on 
bicycles and. as usual, the 
large number of hi cycle thefts. 

Many ~tudents ha\e been 
trying to gt't two parking 
permits for t he price of one. A 
student bu, s a permit and 
reports it missmg, and then he 
gets a new one for Just five 
dollars. Tn the meantime, he 
gives the old permit toafriend. 
or sells it to some 1I nsuspect· 
ing student for a " bargain" 
price. 

Most students do not realize 
that 95% of lost permits are 
found by the police depart· 
ment. They keep a n .'Cord of all 
lost permits, and t hey have 
parkmg representatives spot 
check the parkmg lots to see if 
the numbers of the permlt · 
show UD. 

Getting caught in this sort 
of scheme - \\ hether you are 
the victim of buying a stolen 
perm It, or are t he person 
report ing a lost permit falsely 
- means receiVing a citatIOn 
and answering to criminal 
charges of filing a false report 
and defrauding the Univer· 
sity. 

Because early in the year 
there are new students who do 
not know the trails and are not 
used to t he flow of traffic by 
pedestrians, numerou s 
accidents have been reported 
of bicyclIsts hitting pedestri· 
ans, joggers. cars and other 
bicyclists . Many of these 
accidents have put the victims 
and/or the bicyclists into the 
huspital . One jogger who was 

hit bv a IJlnclt' is in IntenSIve 
Care. Sergeant Jones cl,lImed ,

crisp echo of the steps 
ricocheting acro the par king

that and the late night labor of 
my heart and lung, 

The steady, muffled hiss 
and roar of the old highway 
comes rolling in on the mi t, 
pulling me out of my bed, 
donning the torn army jacket, 
calling me out Into t he parking 
lot (the echo!), mto the car and 
eventually out onto the

he wrecked the car or not . it

in t he passenger's seat, 
watching him viciously 
twi s ting the car around

running thick like cotton 
blocking the road, and us 
running blindly into it. I at

and watched him and listened 
to t he wail of my tires in

tight and grim under the ma k

We ended up in some ;..mall

The only thi11g worse thall being

- Ca ey Stengel, manager of 

the disast rous L962 Mets. 
T he fu nny thing about it all 

was that the UCSD men's 
water polo tea m wasn't trying 
to show up or hum iliate their 
opponents this past weekend; 
it just worked out that way . 
Piling up astronomical scores 
for the sport of water polo, the 
Tritons drowned UC River ide 
(20-15), Whittier (20·5), Cal 
Tech (17·2), and Occidental (9·

Tounament. The four wins 
brought UCSD's overall 
record to a respecta ble 6·8·1 
(all eight losses have come 
against teams rated in the top 
ten in the nation ), and 
everything is fine and dandy in 
paradise. Or is it? 

Last Friday, long time rival 
UC Riverside traveled down I· 
5 to take on the Tritons, but in 
the end it was UCR who was 
sent home packing, somewhat 
em barrasingly. '" t was the 
first time in a long time that 
we had a blowout, and I'm kmd 
of glad for the guy . They had 
a lot of fun out there today," 
said Coach Denny Harper.

Some of the players made It 
known that they wanted to 
dominate Riverside because of 
the rivalry over the years 
(some fi tacuff and dirty play 
have been exchanged in the 
pa t). "We definitely were 
pumped up for Riverside, they 
thought we would overlook 
them, but we ble" them

dean's "lack of direction" as a 
principle r ason for the com· 
mittee's action. This rejection 
i not binding, and it only 
serves as a .recommendation to 
the UCSD admmistration . 

On a I igh t er note, AS College 
Representatives introduced 
their 1982·83 college project~ 
under con ideration . These 
projects include: 

- expanding K, DT serVice 
to Warren and Third colleges. 

- de\'eloping a Warren Stu 
dent Government news let ler: 

- installing small change 
machines on Warren campus. 

- developing plan~ to con-
vert Central library into a 
multl ·purpose faCility (t hus 
faCIlitating TGIF's and the 
like): 

- installing a stamp 
machine in Third College's 
Munch Box; 

- establ i. hing the first 
annual cience fictIon conven· 
tlOn at UCSD; 

- and installing microwave 
oven in the Middle of Muir 
(MOM) and Revelle Commuler 
Lounge, 

In addition, AS Commi sion· 
ers suggested working with 
the administration to develop 
an on·campus trailer park for 
housing and introduced a 
"Chancellor-for·the-day" raf· 
fle. Later, Commissioners 
and Representatives bitterly 
argued over the ill-fated AS 
Summer Travel Board. While 
AS Council members seemed 
to agree that Kim Piont· 
kowski . AS Vice President. 
and Lisa tenmark. AS Com· 
missioner of External Affair , 
had not misu ed travel funds 
this summer, temper flared 
over the B oard's operating 
procedure and a pos ible mis· 
allocation of funds for Chu's 
trip to a UC Student Body 
Pre idents Council meeting in 
Berkeley ,

William5 claims he IS not

the problem and believes the

on proposals which affect

The Uni\'ersity of California 
is required to submit a five· 
year plan on UC t udent 
Affirmative Action to the 
California Legislature by 
April, 1983. 

"ThiS plan will determme 
the direction of the UnlverSI-

for the remainder of thl , 
decade ," says Ceballos . 
"Students must take the 
initiatIve by setting their 
priorities for this five-year 
plan ." 

consl1tutlon and e\erything I 
do is legal. The A is attacking 
me because I have a c1o'>e·knit

support me." 

William s contend~ he has no 
personal galne; if the pelltion 
passes. "I have an idea of what 
[he ~tudents want and 1
