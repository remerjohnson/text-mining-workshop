di covered that the gene 
forced the animal's immune 
y tem to produce lnterlukin-

2, a natural honnone. The 
hormone then stimulates white 
blood cells known as "killer" 
T-cells to attack and de troy 
the tumor. According to 
Allison, human clinical trials 
using gene therapy to fight 
cancer could begin within the 
year.

By Ben Boychuk

Fonner Uni ersity Center Board Chair Chris Burnett tiled a 
n n-academic grievance against nivel-sity Center Director Jim 
Carruthers and tudent Conduct Coordinator icholas Aguilar 

n Thursday. accusing the two administrators of negligence. 
incompetence. hara::,~ment and inteillto cause emotional distre~s . 

Burnett's glievance comes 111 response to allegations of mis-
conductleveledagain,r him during theGencral toreCo-op'~ use 
of the onh Conference Ro m early Fall QuaneI' for te tbook 
sales. The accusations were subsequently dismissed. The griev-
ance requests that fOlmal disciplinary ~tep~ be taken against 
Aguilar and Cat1llthers, "induding, but not limited to, letters of 
reprimand" to be placed in their respective personnel tile~, in 
addition to asking for fonnal letters of apology. 

Burnett filed the grievance shortly after a brief ThuJ"!.day

The Prospectus To Promote 'Politically Moderate~ View 
By Elaine Camuso 
Staff Writer 

The Prospectus, a new student 
journal aimed at aimed at providing 
a forum for IUdent ideas and opin-
ions, publi hed its first is ue re-
cently. According to Editor in Chief 
Darrel Menthe, the purpose of the 
publication is to provide a voice for 
the politically moderate. 

"For a long time now, UCSD ha 
lacked a politically m derate news-
paper, and liberal and mainstream 
view on campu have been without 

an adequate voice," wrote Menthe 
in last month's premiere issue. 

Mentheexplained his reasons for 
establi hing a paper for "moderate" 
readers in a recent interview. Ac-
cording to Menthe, the new indica-
(or and the California Rel'iew, two 
of the more prominent political tu-
dent publications, represented the 
left-and right-wing campu opin-
ion, respe tively. As a Democrat, 
however. Menthe said he felt that 
the nell' indicator was too far to the 
left of the political pectrum to rep-

resent his party. 
"Now, the Califomia Rel'iew, 

mind you, represents the Republi-
cans very well, but the lIew indica-
tor didn't represent me at all. I al-
ways found them extremely leftist, 
anti-American, and I really thought 
that this campus de erved a libeml 
newspaper that wasn't like that," 
Menthe aid. 

"It' s not like I have any wi:.h to 
de troy the nell' indica(or, but I cer-
tainly think there sh uld be a voice 
on campus [for moderates I and I 

always sort of felt cheated by that:' 
he added. 

Menthe said he had wanted to 
establish a paper which represented 
his views for a long time, but felt h(, 
could not gamer the support needed 
to produce it. He said thut the Demo-
crab' election victory provided the 
momentum he needed to get sup-
porters. Through friends he made 
while working on the election am-
paign, he found a way to achieve hi .

Biomedicine Institute 
Receives $3 Million 
RESEARCH: Grant from Whitaker Foundation wiu be 
used to set up a "center of excellence" program 

The UCSD Insri tute for Biomedi-
cal Engineering (IBME) has re-
ceived a $3 million grant from the 
Whitaker Foundation to establish a 
center of excellence to improve re-
search and educational opportuni-
tie for graduate students. 

"The aim of the 
program is to pro-
mote graduate edu-
cation in biomedi-
cal engineering," 
said Institute Direc-
tor Shu Chien in a 
release announcing 
the grant. "This will 
be a tremendous 
boost for our pro-
gram ." 

Money from the 
four-year long program will allow 
UCSD to recrui t sever.ll new fac-
ulty members. increase graduate tu-
dent funding, set up facilities for 
shared research and to introduce 
new educational ini tiatives, accord-
ing to information supplied by the 
university. 

"Thi grant has multiple, lasting 
effects with the end result of foster-
ing biomedical engineering at the 
university:' aid Chien. 

Chien said that the group's ap-
plication to the Whitaker Founda-
tion, a private foundation based in 
Pennsylvania and Washington, 
D.C .. focused on the science of tis-

"l've alway wanted to do it, but 
it ju t never seemed possible to get 
the people and to get orne interest 
going [because I it re;t1ly needed 
some event like the election to kick 
up a storm." Menthe aid. 

According to Menthe. the group 
spent about two months after the 
election writing the text for the is-
sue. It was then "just a matter of 
laying it out and getting it to the 
publisher," he aid. 

The paper encourages contribu-
tions from students, but is also try-
ing to set up a permanent taff. 

Thecurrent staff consists of seven 
members of the College Democrats, 
four of whom are graduating this 
year. 

This creates a need for new staff 
members who will continue with 
the paper next year. 

"The [ taff members] who are 
left really need other people who 
will carry on the work. So we're 

at UCSD: the cardiovascular sys-
tem; somatic tissues like kin , 
muscle, canilage and bones; and the 
neuroendocrine system. 

" These three pecial areas are 
tied together with general ap-
proachesin bioengineering sciences 

along with molecu-
lar, cellular and in-
tegrative biology," 
said Chien. " With 
these as the under-
pinnings, eventu-
ally we want to see 
appl ications for 
clinical and indus-
trial products." 

lbe Institute re-
cently established 
an Industrial Advi-

ory Board made up of leaders in 
industry related to biomedical engi-
neering in the San Diego area. 

UCSD was one of only three 
institution to be awarded grant 
money from among 57 competitors. 
Also selected were biomedical en-
gineering programs at the Georgia 
In titule of Technology and the 
University of Utah. 

In its announcement, the

According to Menthe. one of the 
most important ervices The ProÂ·

the publication of their work. Menthe 
added that it was an important mat-
ter for the staff when founding the 
paper. 

"A ll the new papers on canlpus 
are sort of .... ery closed-shop operd-

Lecturer Says U.S. Must Help in Yugoslavia 
MELISSA BOKOVOY: Professor 
criticizes Western press for its reporting 
of the war, urges U.S. to use military 
By DIanne Haueiman 
Guardian Reporter 

Professor Melissa Bokovoy of the University of 
New Mexico gave a lecture on Thursday for the Ethnic 
Studies Depanrnent entitled " Blood in the Balkan -
Ethnic and Religious conflicts in Yugoslavia." 
Bokovoy's lecture'focused on the historical ethnic and 
religious schisms in Yugoslavia which have served as 
a catalyst to the on-going fighting there. 

The current civil war that is tearing the Balkans apart 
erupted in June 1991 after years of mounting tension 
between the Croatians and the Serbians. 

Bokovoy began her discussion by criticizing West-
ern pre s for its reporting of the war. The Western press, 
Bokovoy said, has communicated to the United State 
an image of inhumane savages committing unspeak-
able atrocities. 

By using such words as "ethnic cleansing," "tribal" 
and "barbaric" to describe the war, Western press 
presents a situation incomprehensible to Americans. 
Inability to understand the actions taken in the Balkans 
reinforces a U.S. policy of non-action, Bokovoy said. 

She referred to the recent reports coming from the 
Balkans of the existence of rape camps where non-
Serbian women are raped by Serbian soldiers. Bokovoy 
connected the rapes to ethnic cleansing efforts. 

According to Bokovoy, the civil war is the outcome 
of generations of ethnic and religious tensions coming 
to a head. 

Yugoslavia has been divided by numerous schisms 
within society throughout its history. Lingual, reli-
gious, economic and ocial differences have created a 
country without a single autonomous center. 

Bokovoy said that although in times of peace, ethnic 
and religious differences can bring about self-identifi-
cation, in the present day they take on an alternative role 
- a roie which " legitimizes responsive action [and] 
promotes we-they thinking." 

According to Bokovoy,Americanscommonly won-
derhow if several generations and time haven 't healed 

Dr. Melissa Bokovoy lectured on Thursday about 
the conftlct In the Balkans. 

the situation, can intervention by the We t bring peace? 
For Bokovoy, U.S. intervention remains her " last thread 
of hope." 

Calling the ci vii war "a period of transition and 
change," Bokovoy said that the West "must reas ess its 
ideas [which] allow the Balkan to kill each other." By 
looking at the issue from "purely moral argument ," 
insteadofintervening militarily, shesaid that the United 
States won 't bring an end to the war. 

She added that such atrocities have happened through-
out history, including in this country. and that the 
United States should not claim a moral high ground in 
Ihe issue. 

Bokovoy fore ees peace through the formation of 
homogeneou regions in the Balkans. The next chal-
lenge will then be for each autonomous area 10 find 
ways to interact between region .

to clarify its relation hip with the administration 
regarding students ' self-assessed fees and facili-
ties. 

In fact, Assembly Bill 1884 was intended to 
addres this issue concretely but was vetoed by 
the governor. who claimed that a new policy 
established by the regents on May 15. 1992 
rendered the Bill moot. Unlike AS 1884. the new 
regents' policy is silent on the issue of student 
control over student fee-funded facilities. After 
AS 1884 was vetoed, the UCB repeatedly asked 
the UCSD administration to release funds for the 
purpose of obtaining an independent legal opin-
ion. 

The requests for funds came at a time when the 
administration was continuously violating lease 
contracts the UCB had with the co-ops and over-
riding board resolutions to solve the issues with-
out excessive force. 

On Jan. 13, 1992. the UeB approved the 
allocation of $5,000 for retaining independent 
legal counsel. 

On April 6, 1992. the UCB created a legal 
affairs committee, in accordance with our chaner, 
which was mandated "to do whatever it deems 
necessary and proper to enable the UCB to obtain 
full control over University Center Fee funds, 
including the retainer of independent legal coun-
sel. ... "

The Demise 
01 the UeB 
Was a Long 
Time Coming 
By Mark Rotenberg 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

THE ANAL REPUDIATION Of 'TWO YEARS OF mismanagement of the University Cen-terBoard (UCB)washandeddownThurs-day from high, on the legal advice of the 
University'S General Counsel office. The action 

was in direct response to a lawsuit served this past 
week by "Chris Burnen" and "University Center 
Board. an unincorporated association." against the 
regents and several administrators to gain direct , as 
opposed to simply advisory. control over the $3.3-
million University Center budget. 

Although it would be reasonable and indeed 
helpful for the University Center Board to clarify its 
legal position with respect to the administration, the 
chosen strategy couldn't have been more careless 
and misguided. Such carelessness has already de-
stroyed one of the most effective student boards on 
this campus. and it will probably cost a handful of 
students and student organizations thousands of 
dollars to clean up the legal bills. 

The ues, which until last year held a pristine 
reputation both with students and the administra-
tion, virtually banished itself into obscurity through 
repeated and often intentional nan-ins with campus 
administrators. 

The downward slide staned after some contract 
disagreements and personality conflicts with the 
leadership of the 1990-91 board, when students 
closely allied with the co-ops mounted a successful 
effort to change the composition of the board to one 
which would more closely parallel their interests. 
The popularly-elected chair was replaced by a chair 
appointed by those people already on the board, and 
the new board began its progressive agenda to break 
free from university oversight, through strategies of 
deception. symbolism. secrecy and confrontation. 

The new regime promptly renamed the Student 
Center the "Student Co-operativeCenter" (although 
only the regents have legal authority to name any 
buildings in the university). set up cushy space 
agreements with the co-ops (many of which were 
never signed by the University Center director). and 
proposed changes to the board's charter (many of 
which were flatly rejected by the A.S.). "Bad faith" 
actions ensued on both sides. particularly with the 
university's break-in of the General Store, and 
finally with the establishment of a clandestine "le-
gal Affairs Committee" to "retain independentcoun-
sel in order to do whatever it deems necessary and 
proper to enable the uca to obtain full control over 
the University Center Fee funds." 

Pursuant to the UCB's charter, the committee

ADISILLUSIONING LESSON IN CAMPUS POLITICS 
By Andrew Clark 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

I was going to announce to the 
universitycomputerne[work last Sat-
urday that the University Center Board 
(UCB) electronic mail account was 
now operational. Bye-maili ng 
"ucsducb@sdcc13," any intere ted 
party would have been able to make 
comments. ask qUeslions or request 
copie of UCB minute and other 
documents. 

Unfonunately. the UCB has been 
"disestablished" by Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson. 
Thi extreme action was taken be-
cause [he UCB had Ihe temerity to file 
a lawsuit against the regents in de-
fense of its rights and responsibili-
ties. The UCB is the tudent repre-
sentative body re pon ible for pro-
viding a studenl voice in the opera-
tion and maimenance of the Student 
Center and Price Center. 

The UCB decided to ue the re-
gents because we felt that we could 
not get access 10 legal advice that we 
needed to carry out our primary ob-
jective of representing student inter-
ests in the Price and Student Centers. 
Every student pays $37.50 per quar-
ter for Ihe operation and maimenance 
of the University Centers. No state

On April 21 , 1992, after fonner 
Chair Molly McKay requested funds 
for external legal counsel. Watson 
wrote, "Such requests [for external 
legal counsel] will be denied until it is 
clearly demon trated that there is .a 
definite need for uch external coun-
el," implying that there are appropri-

ate times for such requests. 
In the Spring 1992 referendum 

which asked, "Should student gover-
nance boards be able to hire, with 
student self-assessed fees, outside in-
dependent legal co un el?", students 
overwhelmingly voted 91 .5 percent 
in favor. In fact, the UCB contacted 
John Francis (the current A.S. attor-
ney) in late spring to represent the

was to make recommendations to the 
UCB on actions it hould take. Also 
according to the UCB' s charter, these 
comminees "shall not conduct busi-
ness on behalf of the University Cen-
ter orthe ues." Despite protests of a 
small minority of the board, the com-
mittee assumed a life of its own. never 
hone tly adhering to thecharterofthe 
UCB. 

Hiding behind claims of attomey-
client privilege, the comminee held 
closed meetings, retained no public 
record of committee business, with-
held important documents and never 
presented its recommendations back 
to the full board. (As a trust of public 
funds. the UCB and all its committees 
are required by law to have open 
meetings for al l interested in anend-
ing; attorney-client privilege on ly 
applies when an attorney i present, 
and none ever was.) 

After being snubbed in its attempts 
to allocate funds to the co-op defense 
fund and a legal opinion on the i sue, 

money is involved. 
The University Centers were pri-

marily built with student money and 
are maintained enlirely with tudent 
money. Students have a vested inter-
est in the operation of the University 
Centers. 

o one can dispute that the UCB 
needed profe ionallegal advice dur-
ing the recent co-op negotiations. The 
UCB, in cooperation wilh University 
Center Director Jim Carruthers, was 
in the proce of drafting a Master 
Space Agreement delegating control 
over the student co-operatives to Ihe 
A ociated Students. Carruthers di-
rected the UCB to ~eek legal advice 
fromloanna Beam of the UCGeneral 
Counsel. At the time. Beam was rep-
resenting the universilY administra-
tion in its negotiation with the co-
op . 

This doesn 't make sense. The UCB 
was being asked 10 transfer a large 
degree of it authorilY to the A.S. -
we needed independent legal advice 
to create a contract suitable to the 
task . The contraci drafted by 
Carruthers could be invalidated by 
"acts of God" and "acts of the Regenls 
of the University of California." I 
always knew that the regents thought 
highly of themselves ... . 

board. He agreed to represent us. but 
was unable to continue due to finan-
cial constraint . 

On Sept 25, 1992, the UCB again 
requested monies to hire counsel and 
was denied. The UCB' only recourse 
was to ask the Superior Court to de-
clare whether or 111J1 we cOllld use 
slIIdelll self-assessedfees to obtain an 
independell/ legal opinion, a very 
simple declaration. As a result, on 
Feb. 4, 1993. one week after being 
served with a lawsuit, the admini tra-
tion declared the University Center 
Board "disestablished" and to be re-
placed by the "Vice Chancellor's 
Advisory Board on University Cen-
ters." 

Despite repeated blunders by the 
UCSD admini tration. I am almost 
surprised by this latest atrocity. When 
students attempt to utilize the proper 
channels within the system to resolve 
issues that are 20 years old (i .e. con-

the comminee voted to bypass nego-
tiation with the university by retain-
ing lawyer Craig Barkac to sue the 
university . 

Although the deci ions were made 
in ecret, lacked outside sludent input 
and were never voted on by the UCB, 
Chair Chris Burnett went ahead with 
filing the case. 

For $5,000 toward the legal case. 
the committee made an unholy alli-
ance with the United Cooperative 
Association (UCA), the umbrella or-
ganization created to incorporate the 
co-ops into for-profit entities. Cer-
tainly, they couldn't expect to win a 
legal case of such proportions against 
the University of California without a 
potential war che t of $40.000 to 
$50,000. 

Muffled voices of dissent were 
suppressed by publicly denouncing 
members of the board who didn't 
endorse the majority's ambition and 
through other intimidation tactics. One 
representative from last year's board 
resigned after she had been repeat-
edly harassed at board meetings and 
over the telephone by zealous law uit 
advocates. 

Indeed. justice isn't cheap. and 
legal bills by the end of 1992 were

sent the interest of students. Wat on 
propo sa "Vice Chancellor's Advi-
sory Board on University Cemers" to 
replace the UCB and prov ide student 
input on the u e of the University 
Center fee . 

The composition of this new board 
demonstrates thai Wat on and hi ilk 
are not concerned about t udenl i nler-
ests. The new "advisory board" con-
tinues 10 have representatives from 
each of the five college '. the A.S .. the 
Graduate Student A ociation (GSA) 
and Student Affirmative Action Com-
minee (SAAC). 

The changes are [he addition of

nated. Assistant Vice Chancellor for 

trol of student self-assessed fees). the 
me age is clear from the administra-
tion; namely. di re pect for the legal 
process and an uncanny and belliger-
ent use of authority. 

In the words of Gary Morrison. 
thi "admirable tradition of tudent 
involvement in decisions affecting 
tudemlife [must recognize] the ulti-

maJeauthority of the regents." In other 
words, students can g ive "advice" 
about their own money 0 long as it 
does not contradicllhe intere tsofthe 
regents. Whattheadmini tration ays. 
goes! At lea t this last act of despera-
tion is an honest expression of the 
university's anitude toward student 
involvement in "campus governance." 

"Di e tabli hing" the University 
Center Board is clearly a de perate 
act on the part of the admini tration. If 
the General Counsel's office is so 
ure of their position, then why abol-

ish a board which is anempting to 

nearly $6,000, even before the fir t 
amended complaint was filed. Faced 
with the looming threat of having to 
foot the legal bill, members of the 
board look their case public. Having 
to explain a bad policy gone haywire, 
members drafted a position statement 
to convince tudents at large why the 
chosen strategies and behind-closed-
doors decisions have been justified 
- no apologies, and no regrets. 

Ironically. as the position paper 
justifying continuing the litigation was 
being completed, a motion to remove 
the UCB's name from a complaint 
which it never approved wa submit-
ted, despite Bumen's loud objections. 
But in the end, the motion was too late 
to save the UCB from the fate it had 
already sealed for itself.

resolve the issue once and for all? The 
reason is clear: a decision by the court 
in favor of the UCB would have state-
wide implicalions for all student elf-
assessed fees by first a knowledging 
that studcnls have a legal righl 10 
control their own monies, euing a 
precedent for other student associa-
tions to follow . changing the internal 
structure at each UC campus in tenn 
of their financial powers and, of 
course. prohibiting the UCSD admin-
istrat ion from unil aterally 
"disestablishing" student assoc iations 
(freedom of association is a First 
Amendment Right.) 

If the administration is allowed to 
get away with this atrocity, then this 
will have grave effects for all student 
governments and organizations at 
UCSD and throughout Ihe stale; in-
cluding, but not limited to. ASUCSD, 
GSAUCSD. SAAC and the co-op. 
We would be telling the administra-

many alternative strategies which the 
UCB and the co-ops could have pur-
sued which would have made tan-
gible progress toward more direct 
control over student fee-funded fa-
cilities, without sacrificing the rap-
portofsuchan essential tudentboard. 
The A.S., which does have legitimate 
financial backing for its legal repre-
sentation. retained John Francis. one 
of the most qualified lawyers in the 
nation with student governments and 
facilities. after Francis had already 
turned down a similar offer from the 
UCB. Since Ihen, Francis has done an 
exemplary job repre enting the As 0 -
dated Students, and was in trumen-
tal in negotiating the 11 th-hour com-
promise Memorandum of Under-
standing this past month. 

Prudence would have dictated that 
the UCB wait to pursue legal action 
until similar legal que tions between 
the A.S. and administration were 
settled, and then to seek ways of ex-
panding the decision to student fa-
cilities eitherexplicitly orby transfer-
ring up respon ibilities from the UCB 
to the A.S.

U CB: University 
closes door on two 
years of UeB actvism 
ContInued from pace 1 

"I don't think I'm prepared to 
work with any committee that is 
going to advise [while at the same 
time] it is going to sue [the univer-
sity)," Watson said. 

Assistant ViceChancellorofStu-
dent Programs and Facilities Tom 
Tucker agreed. "The key is that [we 
were) not getting good recommen-
dations from the current board," he 
said. 

On Jan. 26, the board filed an 
amended complaint in San Diego 
County Superior Court against 
Watson, Tucker, University Cen-
ters Director Jim Carruthers, Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson and the UC 
Regent . The suit i an attempt by 
the board to gain access to the Uni-
versity Center fees for the purpo e 
of retaining independent legal coun-
sel. 

The university insists that the 
board is an advisory body and has 
no right to control the funds or retain 
independent counsel. 

In Morrison 's Feb. 3 memo to 
Watson he wrote that "cases such as 
[the board' lawsuit] are frivolous 
and a waste of university funds. 
Indeed, this lawsuit is such a flout-
ing of university authority that I 
strongly recommend that you 
di establish the University Center 
Board and replace it with an advi-
sory body which understands and 
respects the neces ary conditions 
and limitations upon student par-
ticipation in campus governance." 

Burnell was "infuriated" by 
Watson's decision and he pledges 
to fight the decision in the courts. 

"They think they have the unilat-
eral right to control millions of dol-
lars [of) student money," Bumett 
said. "It 's infuriating. I feel like they 
reacted hastily ... but it doesn't sur-
prise me." 

Burnett added that the adminis-
tration has a history of disbanding 
student organizations when it per-
ceives a threat from the group. 

"This is disgusting. It 's as if you 
disagree with the administration, this 
is the action they are going to take," 
Bumett said. 

Associated Students President 
Mike Holmes said yesterday that 
"we as students, and especially stu-

dents within the A.S .. , have been 
looking to revise the board [but the 
university's unilateral action) has 
been deemed unacceptable by stu-
dent leaders." 

Holmes said that any decision on 
the fate of the UCB should have 
been made with the assi tance of 
student govemmen~. "It didn't go 
through any student decision-mak-
ing," he said. 

The A.S. would most likely sup-
port a temporary restraining order 
to allow time for the matter to be 
settled, he added. 

Fonner Fifth College represen-
tative to the UCB Andrew Clark 
expressed concern over the future 
implications of Watson's action. 

"If the VCSD administration can 
unilaterally disband the University 
Center Board, which student orgaÂ· 
nization is next?" Clark said. ''I'm 
not most concemed about the cur-
rent dispute but about the 
administration 's flagrant misuse of 
its authority." 

However. fonner A.S. represen-
tative to the UCB Mark Rotenberg 
said that while he can understand 
why the university made the deci-
ion to di establish the board. it was 

not the most ethical action it could 
have taken. 

He said that Watson should have 
given the UCB time to vote on a new 
resolution that would have removed 
the board' name from the lawsuit. 
The issue was discus ed at the 
VCB' last official meeting Feb. I 
but could not be voted on until this 
week. 

"The university was basically 
acting in elf-defense and had the 
power to do what it did," said 
Rotenberg. "It' s a culmination of 
two years of mismanagement by the 
board." 

Former UCB Vice Chair Aaron 
Goodman took Rottenburg's com-
ment a step further, saying that 
Watson 's action was necessary un-
der the pre ent circumstances. He 
said that the board's actions were 
clearly out of their area of jurisdic-
tion and that disestablishing the 
board was a necessary step. 

"The old UCB was anchored by 
reckless, agenda-pushing renegades 
[who) tried to make the board some-
thing it was not," Goodman said. 
"Hopefully the new board will be 
something moreeffecti ve-geared 
more toward policies and facilities 
management than towards taking

the regents to court." 
De pite the objections. Bumett 

said the fonnermembers of the board 
will continue to meet and will go on 
with their legal action again t the 
university. He cites the ACLU. the 
Associated Students, the Graduate 
Student Association (GSA), the co-
ops, "private parties" and "con-
cemedstudents"as possible sources 
of funding for the lawsuit. 

The new board will consi t of 
representatives from the five col-
lege councils,the A.S., the GSA,the 
Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee (SAAC), the Academic Sen-
ate, the Alumni A sociation and the 
Staff Association, 

A co-op representative will not 
be included because the co-ops are 
now under the juri diction of the 
A.S. and GSA. accordin g to 
Carruthers. The A.S. and GSA 
agreed last weekend to oversee the 
student co-operatives in negotiations 
between the administr.l.tion and the 
co-ops. 

Tucker said that he does not ex-
pect the UCB decision to affect the 
completion of the co-op negotia-
tions because the university has al-
ready signed the major parts of the 
agreement , including a five-year 
lease agreement. 

Watson aid he hopes to have a 
better relationship with the new 
board. 

"We welcome student participa-
tion, and we welcome working with 
it in a mutual partnership:' Watson 
Â·aid. "but there has to be at least two 
panies to it." 

Tucker agreed, saying that the 
administration "didn't want to lose 
the concept of that kind of inp~" 

Watson will be writing the col-
leges and associations involved in 
the new board regarding the selec-
tion of representatives next week. 

Rotenberg said that he hopes the 
A.S. is included in the creation of a 
new charter for the board to ensure 
that the two bodies have as little 
"overlap" as po sible. He explained 
that the A.S. and GSA should be the 
political bodies for students, and the 
new university centers board should 
confine it elf to purely operational 
and management decisions. 

The A.S. will discuss the matter 
and any possible action at its 
Wednesday meeting, according to 
Holmes.

BURNETT: Fonner UCB 
Chair files grievance 
ContInued from pe&e 1 
indicated that because the charges were unwarranted, 
he wanted a lenerofapology. I providcd one to him," he 
said. 

WalSon added that he did nO( guarantee leners of 
reprimand for Aguilar and Carruthers, and did not draft 
any because "none appeared to be necessary." 

In November. Carruthers accused Burnett ofremov-
ing the door of the North Conference Room,occupying 
the room and refusing to leave when ordered to do so. 
The accusation were officially dismissed by Mort two 
weelcs ago for lack of evidence. Mort found that Burnett 
was not present at the scene during the time he was 
alleged to have committed the violations. 

According to Aguilar, Burnett was never actually 
charged with anything, only accused of possible viola-
tions. "That's a fine di tinction," Aguilar explained, 
"and it's a problem with the two-phase [complaint) 
evaluation proces ." 

Under the CUJTent Student Conduct Code, the direc-
tor of tudent conduct is responsible for reviewing and 
evaluating all complaints to determine the applicability 
of the code to theconduct de cribed in a particular case. 

The director can ei ther dismiss or forward the al-
leged violation totheappropnatecollegedean who then 
decides if there will be a full inve ligation and hearing. 

The grievance was drafted by Irons, who will mosl 
likely represent Burnell duringany formal proceedings. 
Irons aid he intends to question Aguilar's role as 
student conduct coordinator in reviewing complaints 
and recommending prosecution of conduct violations 
without evidence or inve tigation. 

"When the dean got the complaint. all he had to do 
was inve tigate it," Aguilar aid. No evidence sup-
ported the accusations, " therefore no charges were 
filed . The proces worked," he explained. 

The problems ari ing from the Bumen case has 
forced the Office of Student Conduct and kdicial 

Monday, February 8,1993 

David ChO/ Guaroian 
Former UCB Chair Chris Burnett flied a grievance 
acaInst Jim Carruthers and Nicholas "Cullar. 
Affairs to take another look at the current review 
process, according to Aguilar. "As a result of this 
confusion, the process will be revised," he said. 

Aguilar said the entire evaluation and investigation 
process will eventually occur in one office, either 
through the specific college dean's or his own. "We are 
working to eliminate this kind of confusion as to when 
someone is accused and when someone is charged," 
said Aguilar. 

While Aguilar declined to comment on the Burnell 
case specifically, he added that "Idon't forward matters 
unless there is enough information." 

Burnett said his case could "go a lot further" than the 
university grievance process, but would not speculate 
how far he would take the case. "We'll wait and see," he 
said.

Men's Volleyball Misses at Tourney 
By BlaIr Ridley 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's volleyball team 
madeashoncross-towntripthisweek-
end to play in the ASICS tournament 
at San Diego State. losing all five 
matches in which it played. 

The Tritons opened the lOuma-
ment with UeSB on Friday after-
noon. the team ' second match against 
the Gauchos in three days. UCSB 
outslugged UeSD in three straight 
games. IS-12, IS-12. IS-6. 

The Tritons' second match on Fri-

day was against the Matadors of Cal 
State Northridge. 

The Tritons were unprepared for 
this duel, as eSUN de troyed UCSD 
in three game , IS-I . 15-3, IS-IO. 

On Saturday. the Tritons had an-
other tough two-match day sched-
uled. Their first opponent was Indi -
ana-Purdue University. Fon Wayne. 

UCSD continued to play trong 
volleyball. but cou ld not put enough 
points on the board to win games. 
Thu . IPFW defeated the Tritons. 
15-4.15-9, IS-9. 

Jason Rltchle/ GlI8o'dIan 
Trlcla Stilwell had 35 points In UCSD's effort against Cal BaptIst. 

Next up on the bu y Triton sched-
ule was the University of Hawaii. The 
Rainbows were the number-one seed 
from the other pool of team compet-
ing in the toumament. 

UeSD responded with perhaps its 
best match of the weekend, despi te 
losing in three games, 15-4, 15-9, 
IS-1O. 

UCSD Head Coach Rod Wilde 
was impressed with hi team 'splayin 
the Hawaii match. " It was the best 
match we put together all season long. 
We played real well and managed to 

tay with them," the coach said, 
The final contest for the Triton 

was a rematch against lPFW on Sun-
day morning. This time, UCSD played 
Lronger and scored more points, but 

the result was the same, The Tritons 
fell, IS-ti, IS-IO, IS-12. 

Overall, Wilde was pleased with 
his team 's play on the weekend. 

"It was a good tournament for u . 
We went out and proved that we can 
play with other teams. We played at a 
much higher level than we had at the 
beginning of the season," he said

UCSD Gains Weekend Split 
w HOOP: Stilwell scores 35 in Friday loss to Cal Baptist; Tritons top Redlands Saturday 
By Art Root 
Associate Sports Editor 

Friday night was officially billed as 
"SpiritNight,"butthenight belonged to 
UCSD' TriciaStilwel1. Stilwell scored 
acareer-high 3S points and made a club-
record nine three-point baskets as the 

Tritons fell to 
Cal Baptist. 76-
67. 

" I wasn't 
thinking about 
the shot," 
Stilwell said 
when asked 
about her tre-
mendous three-
point shooting "I 
didn ' t have a 
good game 
againstthem last 

year; I had to redeem myself." 
Stilwell earned much more than re-

demption: she eallied the Triton of-
fense. making 12 of 22 hots from the 
field. including a blazing 64 percent (9 
of 14) from beyondthe threeÂ·point stripe. 
While Stilwell sizzled, the rest of the 
Tritons fizzled , making only II of 4S 
shots, a pailI)' 24 percent 

Both teams came out running and 

gunning. After a quick Cal Baptist bas-
ket, the 5-6 Stilwell tied the score at 2-
2, hitting an 18-footjumper 25 seconds 
into the game. Less than two minutes 
later, Stilwell connected on her first 
three-point attempt,giving the Tritons a 
6 -4 lead. 

Cal Baptist, paced by sophomore 
guard Demetria Dixon's II first-half 
points, went on a 22-12 run, giving the 
Lady Lancersa31-201ead with 9:24 left 
in the r IfSI half. The lightning -<tu ick 
Dixon was regularly beating the Triton 
defense, either driving for a layup or 
dishing to wide-open jump shooters. 
J US! when it seemed that the game was 
becoming a rout, Stilwell went on a 
scoring rampage that was simply 
Jordanesque. 

The senior guard lit up the Lady 
Lancers, scoring 17 points in the fmal 
nine minutes of the flfSl half. Over a 
four-minute stretch, Stilwell buried five 
three-point hot. With 45 seconds re-
maining in the half, Stilwell made her 
seventh three-pointer of the contest, 
giving her 25 points in less than 20 
minutes of play. StilweU's long-range 
bombs gave UCSD the momentum as 
the Tritons trailed by only two points at 
the intermission, 41-39. 

The Stilwell hooting clinic didn't 
stop there. Twenty-eight seconds into 
the second half, Stilwell's eighth three-
pointer gave the Tritons a 4241 lead. 

The lead was shonÂ·lived, however, 
as Cal Baptist began keying on Stilwell. 
UCSD couldn't respond to the Lady 
Lancers' boxÂ·and-one defense, shoot-
ing a dismal 28 percent in the second 
half. 

"We had trouble getting the 0011 into 
the ~" UCSD Head Coach Judy 
Malone said about the Tritons' offen-
sivewoes. "When we got the ball inside, 
our posts were cold; they just couldn't 
knock the shots down." 

UCSD (II -II ) snapped their two-
game losing streak with a S9-54 road 
victoryoverRedlandsonSaturday night 
The Tritons led by as many as 19 points 
and urvived a late Redlands charge."In 
the first half, we played some of our best 
basketball of the year," Malone said. 
UCSD's 47 percent first-half shooting 
was the club's best in weeks. Center 
Erica SchoU had 19 points and IS re-
bound<;, while freshman forward SUlCey 
Pa~ko had 10 points and 10 rebounds 
for the Tritons. 

Stilwell'stwo free throws late inthe 
game sealed the victory for UCSD. 

Tritons Sloppy Play Due Only Partly To Rain ' M. HOOPS

said. 

The Triton offense was led by 
Dominic Dirksen,Eric Quandt and Craig

It wa.~theSuper Bowl of basketball games. Not 
because of its imporuUlce or the hype that went 
along with it, but because of the result. The UCSD 
men's basketball team played the Cowboys to UC 
Santa Cruz 's BiII~ as the Tritons romped toa 91-38 
win, their sixth in a row, in front of a large Spirit

The game was over with in seven or eight 

minutes afterthe tip. UCSD's Ouis Moore scored 
the first nine points of the 
game including his first 
three-pointer of the night 
with a minute and a half 
gone. John Spence gave 
UCSDa l-t'() lead when he 
drove left side all the way 
forthe layup. Spence missed 
but picked up his own re-
bound and this time put the 
shot away. He was fouled 
, well and convened on 
the free throw.

get on [he board until 15:43 

was showing on the clock. Anthony Yannana got 
free on the left ' ide for an easy layup and the score 
was 14-2. A minute and a half later, Santa Cruz 
picked up their fifth point ofthe game when Allen

as close as [he Banana Slugs wou ld come all night.

and fed Kareel11 Manhews, who was fouled and 
convened one of [wo from the free throw line. 
Thirty seconds after that. Hantgin broke up a pass 
at midcoun and took it in himself for two again. 

With 7:58 to play, the Banana Slug were still

â¢ Until recently, it seemed as though 
precious few San Diegans embraced 
UCSD as a part of their city. Now the 
city is fmally taking notice of the 
"other" San Diego university. 

BY DA V ID SNO ~v, 
ASSOCIATE FEA T U RES EDITOR 

r
tmt COLLEGE SENIOR ANGre CHOW 
realized there was something 
lacking in UCS D's public image 
when she called a downtown 
San Diego restaurant to ask for 

directions. "Where are you coming 
from?" asked the maitre d' . 

"UCSD." 
"Huh?" 
"UC San Diego," she repeated. 
"Where 's that?" asked the con-

fused restaurateur. 
UCSD students might reasonably 

expect out-of-towners to mistakenly 
enthuse, "How 'bout them Aztecs!" 
when the university's name is men-
tioned, but the school's idemilY prob-
lem becomes significantly more frus-
trating when a native San Diegan 
blum a similar response. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson summed up the feelings of 
many members of the UCSD com-
munity when he said at a press confer-
ence last year, "UCSD is an institu-
tion that San Diegans hardly know 
abou!." 

Many people share this sentiment, 
and believe that Greater San Diego's 
attitude toward UCSD can at best be 
characterized as ambivalent: it knows 
we're up North somewhere, and it 
knows the school does some heavy 
research, but it can't think of a good 
reason why it would want to know 
much more. 

The roots of this attitude, pervad-
ing many aspects of relations between 
UCSD and San Diego, are grounded 
in the history and circumstances of 
UCSD's development Only now are 
perceptions changing, both on cam-
pus and in the City, !hanks in pan to 

the increasing role that UCSD now 
plays in the economy of America's 
Fine t City. Thanks also go to the 
university 's carefully-executed pub-
lic relation campaign. 
Legacy of DIfferences 

Historically, the gap between 
UCSD and San Diego, in both mites 
and understanding, "really dates back 
to the origins of the institution," says 
Atkinson. When the regents first 
planned the campus layout in the 
1950 , they debated whether or not it 
should be named UC La Jolla. The 
proposed campu was cenainly too 
far away from San Diego proper for 
most San Diegans to consider it a part 
of their community. But the regents 
believed that it wou ld be better in the 
end for the university to be associated 
with the expanding metropolis of San 
Diego than with the stodgy and afflu-
ent colony of La Jolla, 

When the university was estab-
lished, San Diego residents did not 
have much cause to take notice. "This 
was a very remote pan of San Diego," 
says Atkinson. "No one was much 
interested in going this far nonh. San 
Diegans really didn't focus on it." 

The university developed and ex-
panded steadilythroughoutthe 19608, 
attracting a respectable faculty and a 
sizable student body. Then, just as 
San Diego was beginning to notice 
the budding institution to the nonh, 
the campus ignited with the upheav-
als of the late '60s. 

Violent anti-war protests and slU-
dent radicals like Angela Davis at the 
university did not draw any sympathy 
from the largely conservative, pro-
military San Diegocommunity, "This 

place really came apan during Viet-
nam," says Atkinson. "It was a small 
campus, but for its size it probably 
had more difficulties than any cam-
pus in the United States." 

Student radicalism left a bad taste 
in the mouths of many San Diego and 
La Jolla residents and officials. But 
the rift between the more liberal cam-
pus and its rock-ribbed neighbors 
occurred before the campus was even 
built, when some residents of La Jolla 
expressed reservations about allow-
ing Jewish faculty members to live in 

their neighborhoods. The anti-war 
uprisings gave some members of the 
surrounding community even greater 
reason to believe that UCSD was an 
undesirable influence in San Diego. 

"It took a long time for some people 
to wann up to the university," says 
Atkinson.

COMMUNI1Y: UCSD 
wants San Diego to appreciate it 
for more than its research success 
ContInued from page S1 
called Connect links San Diego high-tech stan-up with 
potential investors, po itioning the university as a con-
duit for industry growth, much of which has occurred in 
the surrounding area of University City. otherwise known 
as the Golden Triangle. 

"UCSD i till the major focu ,and development has 
to be matched to the university," says R. H. Hamstra, 
former leader of the University City Planning Group, in 
the November 1992 issue of Metropolitan , a Golden 
Triangle bu iness publication. "Many people would ay

ment. Look at the [advancesl coming out of there, like the

large t employer in San Diego, with more than 16,000 
people on i l~ payroll. The university pumps an e timated 
$800 million into San Diego's economy annually. 

Atkin n believes that UCSD's imponance to the 
economy will continue to playa major role in tying the 
university to the community. 'There 's the old San Diego 
which is more in the downtown area," he say~, "and then 
there's all of the e new indu tries and new companie 
burgeoning up nonh here, and the two haven't quite met 
yet. The uni vers ity almo~t ha!> become the meeting 
ground of these various groups." 
Town and Gown 

Moti vating the driving force behind San Diego's 
high-tech indu try is all well and good for UCSD, but it 
hasn't exactly caused the local demand for UCSD 
, weatshins to skyrockel. 

" UCSD has been an asset in bringing more cultural 
opportunities to La Jolla," acknowledges Mariam Kirby, 
executive manager of the La 10lla Town Council. She is 
referring, of course, to the Mandell Wei Theater. "The 
Steven Birch aquarium is a tremendous asset," she adds. 

In other words, residents of La Jolla enjoy coming to 
campus to watch plays and concerts. Are there ever any 
complaint of rowdy tudentsdi turbingLaJolla?"None," 
says Kirby. "Most rudents can' t afford to live in La 
Jolla." 

Indeed, the clear isolation of the UCSD campus from 
its surrounding community i probably something which 
many universities would cherish. '"fown-and-gown" con-
flict have traditionally troubled college towns. Even the 
14th century author Geoffrey Chaucer make reference 
to hostile town people in Cambridge, England beating 
up the bookish college rudents. 

Although San Diego State University i an institution 
slightly removed from Cambridge, it is often involved in 
imilarcollege-communitydi pute . Because of its itu-

ation in the heart of a large residential community, the 
lifestyles of its tudent population often clash with the 
atmo phere of the comm unity. 

Families in the Mea often register complaints about 
wild panies and are disturbed by State student who stay 
out late. These complaint~ have developed into outright 
battles on occasion, especially when the university at-
tempt to build more dormitories in re idential di trict . 

"Any time we sneeze. the people around here get 
upset becau e they are right on top of u ." complains 
Rick Moore. director of communications for SDSU. 

Recurring local tensions aside, SDSU's formidable 
rudent population. its 6O-year entrenchment in San 

Diego and, some would argue, its Divisiol'l I spon 
program and a reputation as a fun place to go to chool, 
have made it "San Diego's University" in the minds of 
many locals.

Many believe that, aside from its obvious local eco-

have had a difficult time making a noticeable impre sion 
on the greater community. That UCSD is a school with 
tens ofthouS3nds of tudent often get lost in the hubbub

to turn students away from the doors [when those schools 
come]. UCSD i a local school and a lot of kids want to 
go away." 

Of course, it can be reasoned that most local high 
school students wouldn't need to attend the UCSD pre-
entation because they think they already know what 

UCSD is like. Bonnie Laughlin, college coordinator at 
Torrey Pines. repons that interest among her students in 
attending UCSD is very high. However, "what sells 
UCSD is proximity to home, comfon level and academ-
ics, but not the ociallife." she says. 

"UCSD i not perceived as a fun place," observes 
Laughlin. "Fun, to the kjds, is UCLA or UC Berkeley. 
Fun i Santa Barbara because it' pany, pany, pany. Fun 
is not UCSD. The Golden Triangle does not give UCSD 
a flavor like UCLA or Berkeley." 
.......Pow ... 

Thee sence ofSDSU's public relations can be appre-
ciated by a call to its media office. ;'What spon is this 
regarding?" ask the receptioni t. 

It 'seasyto pinpoint UCSD's lack ofa big-name spons 
program as a primary reason for its paucity of affection 
from the masses. Atkinson is quick to counter that 
school uch as M.l.T. and Cal Tech have achieved an 
admirable reputation withollt Division I spons. 

According to Atkin on, UCSD is the lone public 
university in the pre tigious 56-member A sociation of 
American Universitie. that gets by withoLit a "big-time" 
football program. 

';1 think we do get a lot of attention in the media," ays 
Atkin on. "We don't get it on the spons page_ but we get 
it everywhere else." 

Not surprisingly. the bulk of the Ullioll-Triblllle's 
coverage of the university focuses on the myriad of 
scientific breakthroughs pouring out its doors. The news-
paper payrolls three fu ll-time science writers who keep 
busy staying on top of the research done in the laborato-
ries of UCSD. Th is reponing tends to overshadow the 
stories about student life which occasionally appear on 
the TV screens and the page of San Diego newspapers. 

Once again. Moore says that SDSU envies this sup-
posed image problem. "UCSD gets more coverage, and 
[it's] better. Ours concentrates on budget cuts, protests, 
students unhappy about condoms.. . I am continually 

amazed by thi . Your campus has car thefts, tudents pany, 
students get sexually assaulted, and no one pay anent ion. " 

According to Moore, UCSD's on-going co-op crisis 
would be seen as a major story if it happened at State. He 
say that the public doe not recognize the quality of the 
academics at SDSU. " Both of our campu es feel that we 
don't get attention. We would like less breaking news and 
more substance," he says. 

UCSD Office of Communication Director Win Cox 
thinks that the university's rJPpon among the public has 
improved teadily through the years. Her office conducted 
an extensive public perception survey five years ago which 
found, among other things, "that people have a very high 
opinion of UCSD. and they understand its academic 
strengths. Mo t people can ea ily distinguish UCSD from 
[the University of San Diego] and SDSU." 

Cox , ays that her offi e i actively trying to put more 
student-related stories in the local press. "People in San 
Diego don't understand the wealth of tudent experience 
here. We try to integrate the campus into the community. 
This is very imponant to us." Cox explain . 

Atkinson admits that he till thinks San Diego residents 
don't realize how important the university is to their city. but 
he emphasizes that the level of awareness b alre:ldy pretty 
high. and is growing tead ily. As more and more UCSD 
graduates join the rJnks of State graduates in posit ions of 
leadership in San Diego, UCSD' public image cannot help 
but be enhanced, Atkinson says. 

Morgan believes that it can no longer be said that UCSD 
is a stranger to San Diego. 'This town-and-gown schism 
was very noted in the '60s and '70s, but it has vastly 
dissipated. I was at Oxford recently, and heard the same 
complaints. and they've been there for 500 years." 

But the initial confu~ion caused by an call placed to 
Torrey Pine High S hool reminds that the level of aware-
ness about UCSDcan still stand some improvement: "Where 
did you say you were from? San Diego State?"
