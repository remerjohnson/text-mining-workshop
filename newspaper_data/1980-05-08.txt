Regents· Tuition Meeting 
Put Off Pending Election 

Another Election Surprise: 
A < pecial May meeting on tuition, mentioned as a possibility 

at the March Regents meeting, has fallen through.

UC President David Saxon, who expressed skepticism at the 
idea when it was first broached two months ago, wrote the 
Regents earlier this month and told them that there is "no more 
information about the Governor's contingency plans," and no 
likelihood that there will be soon.

The way the AS is taking to Jeremy Charlton, 
you'd almost think he was their own idea. 

The self· proclaimed "Very Silly Man" elected 
AS President Tuesday by a narrow 35-vote 
margin has become the catalyst for an 
examination by AS officers of , the reason for 
his election, and almost all of them like what 
they see. 

"The AS has been taking care of external 
affairs really well in the last two or three years," 
current President Carlos Montalvo says. 
"We've gone from nowhere statewide, trying to 
abolish the Regents and the Student Body 
President's Council, to it in systemwide things. 
That's why the student lobby conference it here 
next week. 

"But we've ignored on campus concerns -
student morale, the lack of student accessibility 
to the AS Council. :A.nd that's why students 
voted for Jeremy," he argues. 

With five . of the 13 
committee members absent, 
the bill, sponsored by 
Assemblyman Tom Bates of 
Berkeley, received only five of 
the seven votes necessary to 
pas pn to the full assembly. 

Although covered by the 
federal Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act, 
students are excluded from 
California's 1977 Information 
Practices Act.

"Jeremy will take care of those things, and we 
can still do serious things with him in office. 
Maybe we needed a breath of fresh air," he said. 
"Jeremy's hot. I even offered him a job as my 
budget intern after his campaign last year."

David Marc Belkin Lecture-----------~ 

Environment Sacked for Energy 
BY JONATHAN KROLL 

The United States is destroying the environment 
at a faster pace than ever in its mad dash for energy, 
David Brower, internationally distinguished 
conservationist, told an audience of 175 in the 
Mandeville Auditorium Tuesday evening. 

Brower, who was given the Sierra Club's John 
Muir Award in 1977 and was nominated for the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 and 1979, gave the 
second of the Belkin lectures on environmental 
issues. The Belkin lectures was i>egun by the 
parents and friends of David Marc Belkin, a Muir 
College graduate who lost his life in the Sierras in 
1978. 

The United States is waiving environmental 
protection laws for "priority" energy needs, he said. 
"One hundred million acres were set aside in 
Alaska for protection, but the same amount has 
been put up for grabs for energy use by the Carter 
Administration. More land has been put up for 
grabs in this Administration than all the others since 
Calvin Coolidge." 

The news is getting worse al Carter pursues a 
policy of "strength through exhaustion," where the 
US uses its resources faster than ever to increase its 
strength, said Brower. "That's energy for a brief 
America not a strong America. 

"The things we lose we can probably never get 
again," he said. "We're wiping out one species 
every day," he added. He discussed the ca e of the 
California condor which faces extinction due to 
destruction of its last refuRe. There are solutions to 

prevent the condor's extinction which include 
captive breeding or tracking them with electronic 
gear, but Brower favors saving the condor's 
habitat. 

If the condor's range ' is not protected oil 
companies, careless hunters, sprayers, and 
roadway builders will destroy its habitat, he warned. 

"The condors' chances of survival are too much 
like our own," said Brower. He compared the 
condor's threat of extinction to man's potential self-
destruction due to nuclear proliferation. 

Nuclear war "will be inevitable by the 1990s if 40 
countries are expected to have nuclear weapons," 
he said. . 

"We're smart enough not to want a nuclear war, 
but not bright enough to avoid stumbling into one," 
he added. He called the proposed MX missile "the 
Maginot Line on Amtrak," and said the world has 
to pull back if it is to prevent disaster'. 

His generation inherited the American Dream, 
he said. There may not have had all the benefits that 
corne with progress, but his generation had 
orchards, fresh air and wilderness, he said. 

This generation in~erited the apprehension of 
nuclear waste and the threat of nuclear war. 
"However, the American Dream can possibly be 
bro'!Sht back to tife," he added. 

"The world population burden is unsustainable 
and it must be brought back to two billion people or 
less - roughly half of today's population. "We 
don't have the ability to sustain the population we 
have now," he said. 

He rejected a suggestion from the audience that 

withholding food from third·world nations was a 
way to reduce one's populatJon. We can not 
withhold food from anyone alive today, he said. 

Brower came out strongly against automobiles, 
saying, "I would have liked to disinvent the wheel." 
He added that the temptation exists to go to the 
gasahol, a petroleum.alcohol mix, now that there is 
a gas shortage. 

"But it takes 40 times more acreage to feed a car 
with gasahol than to feed one person in the third· 
world," he said. 

Brower said the solution to our energy needs 
should be the "soft energy" path, e.g. solar energy. 
He criticized continuing the "hard energy" path of 
using irreplaceable resources. Offshore oil drilling, 
for example, poses a serious threat to the 
environ(T'lent. A major oil spill in the Beaufort Sea 
would wipe out half of the estimated 2,500 
bowhead whales," he said. "The chances of a major 
spill are enormous," he added. A slowdown of the 
use of fossil fuels such as oil would have the benefit 
of decreasing air pollution and mutagens in our 
environment. he said. 

Brower cited Davis, California as a model city. 
Bicycles are the prime mode of transportation and 
the UC city is making the transition to solar energy, 
in addition to taking energy conservation measures, 
he said. San Diego, however, is in a race to become 
another Los Angele , he added. 

"We've come to an abyss," Brower aid. "When 
you have gon to an aby s the only move you can 
make is to turn around and move forward. " 



In Vitro Process 
Makes Guinea Pig 
Of Mother, Child 

BY DR. RlITH HUBBARD 
Pacific NeWi Service 

A n estimated 10 million Americans are infertile: they want children. but for a variety of reasons. they cannot have them. Until the birth of Louise Brown in England 
in 1978, those people had little to look forward to but more 
disappoinbnent. 

Louise was a test tube. or "in vitro" baby, conceived in a 
laboratory and implanted in her mother's womb, bypassing 
the blocked Fallopian tubes which prevented passage of the 
ega into the uterul for normal fertaization. 

For at least 600.000 American women who are infertile 
because of damaged Fallopian tubes. the story of Louise 
Brown offered new hope. Two more children. one in India, 

Ruth Hubbard is a Harvard University Biologist. 

another in England, were conceived outside the womb the 
following year, and a clinic in Norfolk. Virginia, announced 
last March that it had .ucceeded in impregnating women in 
the US through .imilar procedures. 

But hopes ihat one solution to infert~ty has been found are 
premature, and they may be dangerous. 

A. a woman, a fernim.t and a biologist, I am opposed to 
implementation of in vitro fertilization technolo~y - because 
it is untested, because it is not the ''liberating' development 
many people believe it to be, and because it is an expenaive 
eIi.traction from more pressing health problem •. 

Science does not have a very good track record in 
anticipating the problem. that can arise from technological 
tampering with nature. Ow theoretical models are too simple· 
minded and have led to many unforeseen problem. of pest 
control, waste di.posal. and other aspects of what is usually 
referred to as the ecological ai.is. 

. In reproductive biology, many interacting processes. 
. though often crucial, are poorly understood. We cannot ' 
enumerate or describe the many reactions which must occur 
at aitical times during the early stages of embryonic 
development when the fetus begins to develop and" implant 
itself in the uterus. To solve that problem. science needs 
guinea pig. - and these guinea pigs will be: 

-the women who donate fertilizabl~ eggs; 
-the women who lend their wombs (they need not be the 

same 81 the egg.oonor.: rent·a·wombs dearly area technical 
option); 

-the children who are "produced." 
This raises ethical and practical questions. Children can 

not con.ent to be produced and we will not know whal 
haz.ds their production entails until a large enough number 
of them have lived out their lives to allow for statistical 
analysi. of their medical hi.tories. 

At the very least, for the first lJeneration of "test· tube" 
individuals who will be viewed as "special" at every critical 
juncture in their lives, special self-doubts may be added to the 
usual repertory of insecurities. 

A concrete example of scientific misjudgment whose 
unfortunate outcome could not be predicted was the 
administration of the chemical thalidomide. a "harmless 
tranquilizer" that was touted as a godsend and medically 
prescribed to many pregnant women in the Fifties. It resulted 
in the births of thousands of armies. and legless babies. 
Another is the hormone DES (diethylstilbesterol). which was 
a1.0 prescribed for pregnant women in the mistaken belief that 
it could prevent miscarriages. In this instance, some fifteen 

. years passed bfore doctors realized that many of the 
daughters of these women developed vaginal cancer. 

Both of these chemicals produced otherwise rare diseases. 
so that the damage was easy to detect and its cause could be 
lIOught. Had they produced commonly seen symptoms - as 
in vitro fertilization may do - it would have been much more 
difficult to detect the damage and to pin·point harmful drugs 
in order to stop their use. 

The a11.important point is that both thalidomide and DES 
changed the environment in which babies developed in ways 
that could not have been foreseen and that we still do not 
understand. We know very little about how human embryos 
develop. How can we claim to know that the many chemical 
and mechanical manipulations of eggs, sperm and embryos 
which take place during in vitro fertilization and implantation 
are harmless? 

Moreover. the push toward this technology reinforces the 
view that .women s lives are unfulfilled or indeed worthless 
unle.. we bear children. I understand the wiah to have 
children, though I also know people - women and men -
who lead happy and fulfilled lives without them. But even for 
those who deeply want a child, it is not worth opening the 
hornet's nest of reproductive technology for the privilege of 
using their own eggs or sperm. 

Some proponents of this new technology argue that every 
woman has a right to bear a child and that in vitro fertilization 
will extend this right to a group that has hitherto been deprived

TCPB Objects to Misnomer 
Editor: 

The Third College 
Program Board would like to 
formally protest the misuse of 
our title in Cinco de Mayo 
publicity. Specifically, . we 
Qbject to the designation 
"Lumumba.Zapata Pro· 
gram Board" by MEChA. as 
opposed to our official title of 
Third College Program 
Board (hereafter referred to 
as TCPB). 

In our meeting of May 5. 
1980, the TCPB voted 
unanimou51y to enter this 
protest and to request a 

.:orrection of this misnaming. 
along with an apology 
submitted to the TCPB. The 
reasons for this request are as 
follows. 

First, the TCPB was not 
informed of the alteration of 
our title at the time MEChA . 
requested funding for 
Herman Baca, or at any time 
before or after Cinco de 
Mayo activities. If we had 
been told that this title qould 
be given 10 the TCPB, we 
would have told MEChA 
that this name could only be 
used tt) represent TCPB by 

student referendum appro· 
val. Therefore, MEChA, nor 
TCPB, had the authority to 
approve this name.

and Restaurants 

Second. we are sure that 
many MEChA members are 
aware of the political 
volatility of the naming issue, 
and the detrimental effect it 
has had upon the effective· 
ness of Third College student 
government and the college 
as a whole. It has been our 
hope to have the TCPB 
function .()lJlside of college 
politics and not become a 
vehicle for political 
maneuvering. Because of 
student protest, we feel that 
we have been unwittingly 
pushed into the center of a 
political coptroveny which 
may ultimately prevent us 
from performing our 
designed purpose of 
sponsoring a diverse range of 
activities for Third College

You ran two articles

Hostages Moved, . 
Negotiations Static 

TEHRAN - Militants were 
reported yesterday to have 
moved a 12th group of 
American hostages from the 
occupied ~S Embassy in 
Tehran to another city. Two 
Iranian leaders rejected a 
suggestion by British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher 
that the freedom of the US 
prisoners could come faster 
because of the commando raid 
freei ng Ira nian hostages in 
London. 

In Milan. Italy . Iranian 
Foreign Minister Sadegh 
Ghotbzadeh was quoted as 
saying the lengthy standoff 
could be settled "in an 
ho norable and acceptable 
way" once the Iranian 
parliament convenes. The 
second round of parliamentary 
voting is Friday. 

There were these other 
developments: 

- Ayatollah Mohammed 
8ehesti . secretary of the 
Revolu tionary Council . told 
reporters he expected the 

hostage debate to begin 
"perhaps in six weeks." Both 
reject e d th e Thatch e r 
suggestion. 

- A gunman ambushed 
the 24·year·old son of Iran's 
Anglican bishop and shot him 
dead . reports reac hin g 
London said. The victim. 
Bahram Deghani Talti, an 
Oxford graduate, had worked 
as an interpreter for foreign 
reporters in Tehran. His 
father . Bishop Degham Tafti . 
left Iran for Cyprus alter 
escaping an assassination 
attemot last October. 

- Behesti said the Iranian 
government arrested a 
number of Iranians accused of 
being US agents following the 
fa iled US rescue mission. 

Tehran Radio said the latest 
group of hostages moved from 
the embassy were taken to the 
city of Gorgan . 185 miles east 
northeast of Tehran and only 
about 20 miles from the

Kennedy, Bush 
Urged to Quit 

WASHINGTON - Pres· 
sure was building yesterday on 
Sen. Edward M. Ke nnedy and 
George Bush from within their 
own parties to withdraw from 
the presidential race after the 
latest round of primaries saw 
them fall further behind 
President Carter and Ronald 
Reagan. . 

But both Kennedy and 
Bush vowed to continue their 
campaigns despite landslide 
losses in Indiana . North 
Carolina and Tennessee. 

And Rep. John B . 
Anderson said those who 
c laim his independent 
presidential candidacy might 
throw the November election 
into the House of Representa· 
tives are using a "strategy ·of 
fear" to draw votes away from 
him. 

Texas Democratic chair· 
man Bill Goldberg was trying 

to recruit other state party 
chairmen to join in sending a 
telegram to Kennedy urging 
him "not to continue the 
futility " of his campaign 
against Carter. 

Muskie Sails 
Through Senate 

WASHINGTON - The 
Senate voted overwhelmingly 
yesterday to confirm Sen. 
Edmund S. Muskie as 
President Carter's secretary of 
state. The vote was 94 to 2 to 
approve Carter's nomination 
of the Maine Democrat to 
head the State Department. 

Only Sen. Jesse Helms. R. 
NC , and Sen. Gordon 
Humphrey . R.NH . voted 
against the nomination. 

Anti-Busing Bill 
Can't Be Revived 
SACRAMENTO - Busing 
opponents failed yesterday to 

vetoed by 
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. as 
unconstitutional. which would 
have made school segregation 
harder to' prove in court. 

The bill would have sought 
to exempt California from US 
Supreme Court rulings 
covering school districts that 
have been found guilly of 
intentional segregation in the 

. past. 
The distinction is important 

because federal courts allow 
busing orders only in cases of 
intentional segregation.

Academic Senate Rules on Ambiguity 
BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 

The UCSD Academic Senate has ruled that 
students found cheating in class may not 
withdraw from the University in order to avoid 
having an F placed on their transc ripts . 

The decision was handed down at the 
Senate's April 22 meeting, after an appeal by a 
UCSD student who was found cheating and 
withdrew in order to escape being failed . 

Muir Assistant Dean Judith Green, who 
brought the student's petition to the Senate, 
argued that the student considered University 
regulations ambiguous on the subject. 

The policy specifically states that "a student 
who is guilty of academic dishonesty may ' not 
drop the course to avoid a failing grade without 
the approval of the instructor, regardless of the 
rules governing 'drops.' .. 

However, Green said, " the student withdrew. 
Withdrawing is leaving the University for that 
quarter. The policy contains no provisions 
concerning withdrawal, and therefore the 
student withdrew." 

The dispute originated in Winter Quarter of 
1979 after the student withdrew having been 
caught cheating and told by his professor that he 
would be flunked. 

\\'hen the professor discovered this he 
contacted the Council on Academic Policy and 
soon thereafter saw to it that an F was placed on 
the student's tran cript. 

When the student learned this, he appealed to 
the CEP (Committee on Educational Policy), 
and when his appeal was denied , he appealed to 
the Academic Senate. 

Legislature to 
Block a Prof? 
SACRAMENTO - Two legislators said 
yesterday they will try to block the promotion of 
Iranian UN Ambassador Mansour Farhang to a 
full professorship at Sacramento State 
University. 

Assemblyman Gordon Duffy, R-Hanford , 
said he would try to block approval of the budget 
for the state college and university system unless 
Farhang is refused a promotion. 

Sen. Lou Cusanovich, R- Woodland Hills , 
said he wouldn't try to block the budget because 
"I wouldn't take it out on the whole student 
body. "

Jupiter's 
WASHINGTON - Pho-

tos snapped by the Voyager I 
spacecraft have disclosed a 
15th satellite orbiting about 
94,000 miles above the cloud 
tops of the planet Jupiter. 

It is the second new Jovian 
moon discovered by the pair of 
Voyagers that swept past the 
planet last year. The other was 
detected in photos taken by 
Voyager 2. 

The National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration 
reported yesterday that the 
new satellite, temporarily 
identified as 1979 J2, was 

15th Moon Found 
identified by Dr. Stephen P . 
Synnott of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, 
Pasadena, Calif. 

Synnott was examining 
Voyager 1 photos relayed 
March 5 , 1979, just before the 
spacecraft made its closest 
approach to Jupiter, when he 
noticed "a shadow stepping 
acro'ss the face of Jupiter 
where no shadow should have 
been," NASA said. 

By studying other 
transmitted images, Synnott 
found evidence of the satellite 
In several other photos and 

was able to calculate its size 
and orbital path. He reported it 
is 43 to 50 miles in diameter 
and that it circles Jupiter once 
every 16 hours 16 minutes on 
a path between the orbits of the 
satellites A malthea and 10. 

Synnott said he first noticed 
the shadow while searching 
the photos' to confirm the orbit 
of the satellite found in images 
transmitted by Voyager 2 last 
July 8. That moon, 
temporarily labeled 1979-J 1, 
first showed up as a star-like

Scripps' Sister Hospital 
Encinitas Given Accredi\.~~, .. ~ 

Former San Dieguito Hospital Gets Maximum 
BY BILL KNOWLES 

SlAff Writer 

Sc ripps Memorial Hospital-
Enci nitas, sister hospital to the Scripps 
Hospital on the northern border of the 
UCSD campus, last month received its 
fu ll accreditation by the Joint 
Commiss ion on Accreditation of 
Hospitals. 

The accreditation comes after a 
survey conducted in December by 
repres.entatives from the JCAH, the 
California Medical Association, and 
the Department of Health Services. 
The purpose of the JCAH is to identify 
for the public those hospitals which 
meet its standards. 

According to Donald Zuercher, 
hea d of the Scripps-Encinitas 
Administration, reactions to the two 
year accreditation were very favorable 
at the Hosptial. 

"Everybody works very hard to 
meet the standards of the accrediting 
body. Everybody affiliated with the 
hospital is very pleased when we get 
maximum accreditation," Zuercher 
said. 

Scripps, he added, is one of 4,900 
out of about 6,600 voluntary, general 
acute hospitals in the United States 
which have recei"ed this recognition. 
Although the survey by they JCAH is 
voluntary, Zuercher acknowledged 
that Medicare will only be given to 
those hospitals which are accredited . 

The JCAH, begun in 1918 by the 
American College of Surgeons, and 
incorporated in 1951, is a non-profit,

UCSD is served by the Scripps-La

emergency care can get admittance 
forms from the Student Health Center,

"Students receiving these forms are 
treated at our Emergency Room

there, ' she added. 

New Prosthetics Reduce 
T errors of Breast Cancer 

"The first reaction of most women in 
whom breast cancer is diagnosed is 
that they may lose their breasts. Only 
then do they register the news that they 
haye cancer," says Robert Singer , a 
plastic surgeon at Scripps Memorial 
Hospital. 

However, recent medical 

breakthroughs have apparently made 
certain types of breast reconstruction 
safer and more tolerable by tile body. 
These most current techniques involve 
the insertion of a prosthetic implant 
where breast tissue ordinarily is 
located , a method which doctors say is 
significantly reducing the fears in 
women facing mastectomy.' 

Jupiter's 15th Moon 
In order to inform women of the 

alternatives available to them should 
they face breast removal, the Scripps 
Memorial Hospital foundation is 
sponsoring a public forum entitled, "A 
Symposium on the Breast, "

miles above the Jovian clouds. 

The finding of the 14th and 15th 
moons add to an impressive list of 
Jovian scientific observations made 
by the twin Voyagers . Among the 
discoveries are a ring of particles 
around the lanet, considerable 

volcanic activity on 10 and 
tremendous bolts of lightning in the 
planet's atmosphere. 

The two Voyagers are now enroute 
to Saturn, with Voyager 1 slated to fly 
by that planet next November and 
Voyager 2to follow in August 1981. 
Voyager 1 then is to continue on to an 
encounter with distant Uranus in 
January 1986. 

The forum, offered free of charge to 
the public , will feature a panel of three 
physicians. .

Film/Rick Greene 

'39 Steps' Rentakes Hitchcock's 'Northwest' 
It is nighttime, and we see a 

pre-World War I fog-shrouded 
London. A secret service 
official is murdered with a 
sword-cane by a double-agent 
from Prussian Intelligence, 
while a spy in a black cloak 
trie s to convince the 
authorities of an impending 
assassination with the facts 
written in code in his little black 
book_ So 'begins the third film 
version of John Buchan's 

The Daily- Guardian 

Arts 
suspense novel The Thirty-
Nine Steps. 

In the original novel, The 
Thirty-Nine Steps had 
something to do with a cult 
called Black Stone and a 
villain "with eyes lidded like a 
hawk." In Alfred Hitchcock's 
famous film version, the first of 
three, the thirty -nine steps 
were a secret spy network and 
the lead villain was missing a 
finger on his right hand. In the 
new Rank Organization 
presentation of the story, the 
secret of the thirty-nine steps is 
changed again and the master 
villain isn't deformed at all, 
though the plot is. 

It must be pointed out from 
the beginning that the new 
Thirty-Nine Steps is not a 
remake of the Hitchcock 
cl assic. The two have very 
little in common. In fact, The 
Thirty-Nine Steps is a remake 
of Alfred Hitchcock's North 
by Northwest. 

Most of the plot incidents 

come right out of the 1959 
Cary Grant thriller: The old 
'knife trick' where the hero is 
seen pulling a knife out of the 
back of a murder victim and he 
is blamed _ .. The oft-used 
"double chase" where both 
police and villains chase the 
hero as he tries to clear 
himselLThe old 'fake death' 
gag used to throw the villains 
off the scent and even , which 
took a lot of gall, the famous 
crop-duster scene! At one 
point a policeman explains 
that Richard Hannay (the 
bewildered hero, played by 
Robert Powell) always travels 
"in a· northwest direction. " 
Even the end is a reworking of 
the Mount Rushmore finale of 
danger In high pla ces , 
although there is a good dose 
of Harold Uoyd thrown in. 

The plot concerns the 
efforts of Richard Hannay, 
your average English innocent 
bystander, to prevent the I 
assassination of the Greek 
premier and stop WWI from 
beginning, early in 1914. The 
entire film is one long chase, 
filled with uninspired captures 
and escapes across England 
and Scotland and one of those 
love-at-first-sight romances for 
no apparent reason other than 
it was in the script. 

Robert Powell is rather 
insipid as the lucky hero who 
manages to escape profes-
sional assassins every time, 
Powell is still and blank-faced, 
reads his lines straight and 
doesn't want to upset the 
audience by acting. David 
Warner is his usual hateful self 
as the chief villain, double

agent and murderer extraordi-
naire. I stopped counting after 
the sixth body_ 

Although many of 
Hitchcock's story ideas and 
situations have b e en 
borrowed , none of his 
traditionally fluid camera work 
or creative angles and zooms 
are used. The writer, Michael 
Robson, even has a few new 
tricks up his pen . A highlight of 

the film (one of two) is the 
smashing sequence where a 
drugged Hannay races down 
the twi sting corridors of a hotel 
in a runaway wheelchair. The 
other highlight is during the 
end credits, when we find that 
the dreadful score was done by 
Ed Welch and the Rank 
Concert Orchestra. It was 
rank indeed . 

The film cries out for much 

more humor than it ha.. It 
ends up as just a series of 
adventure sequences which 
lack any real thrills or 
suspense and are only mildly 
amusing. The Thirty-Nine 
Steps is a film of fair moment., 
fair performances and a 
bloody rotten musical score: 
those unfamiliar with North by 
Northwest may enjoy it but the 
film is a disappointment. 

Prof. Longhair (Live, Weiland 
Legendary) Sings on Album 

Professor Lon ghair 
(Henry Roeland Byrd) is 
one of those mythic figures 
whose legend looms so 
large you fi gure he's got to 
f all short of expectations. 
Not so, glad to say_ 

Longhair touts himself as 
the mentor of such New 
Orleans standouts as Fats 
Domino, Huey "Piano" 
Smith, Allen Toussaint and 
Dr. John (Mac Reben-
nack). 

He labored mostly in 
obscurity after a brief 
regional heyday in the early 
50s , when he fronted 
groups with names like the 
Blues Scholars and the 
Shuffling Hungarians. 

In 1970 some' British 
blues aficionados found him 
sweeping out a record store 
in New Orleans. Atlantic 
Records then released some 
early sides, and Paul 
McCartney featured the 
professor at a private party 

on the Queen Mary , 
resulting in a live album. 

Those re cords were 
good, and they confirmed 
.the rumor of Longhair's 
greatness_ They also 
displayed his role as a link 
between rhythm and blues 
standouts and the early 

Music/Bud Russell 
barrelhouse piano style of 
even more legendary 
names like Sullivan Rock, 
Tuts Washington , Kid 
Stormy W eathe r and 
"Boogus," the last of whom 
could play only the black 
keys (you know he had to 
be good.) 

Longhair's style incor-
porates a number of other 
influen ces: rhum ba , 
mambo, calypso and the 
unique second-line beat 
created by the crowd at 
New Orleans jazz funerals~ 

not to mention traces of the 
indescribable "Mardi Gras 
Indians." 

Crawfilh Fiesta is the 
consummate expression of 
a tough but rich life . . 
Longhair's tale is a classic 
one: he started out as a kid 
dancing for change on the 
streets, boxed for small 
sums, worked as a cook 
and cardplayer. 

That wealth of experi-
ence was not wasted, if the 
humanity radiating from 
this record is any measure. 

The tunes are varied. 
Her Mind Is Gone and It's 
My Fault, Darling are easy-
going, wry commentaries. 
Cry to Me and Something 
on Your Mind show the 
professor in command of 
the traditional rhythm and 
blues mode.

piano seems to take on a 6fe 
of its own, in tandem with 
the every.active sax 
section. Longhair romps 
and stomps, he rocks and 
he rolls so that he makes 
you think he could never 
stop. 

Willie Fugal's Blues and 
Crawfish Fiesta are 
strikingly lyrical and 
moving-the latter a 
haunting amalgam of folk 
melodies including, A 
Tisket a raskel.

His singing consists of 
crooning and marvelous 
scatting, as ' well as 
something approximating a 
yodel when his voice breaks 
suddenly into a falsetlo.

In Vitro Process AS Likes Charlton 
Continued (rom page 2 

of it. Let's consider that argument. In our culture women are 
taught from childhood that we must do without lots of things: 
electric trains, baseball mitts, <\Ild in many cases, an 
expensive education or a well-paying job. We are also taught 
to submit to restrictions and dangers: we can't go out alone at 
night, we allow ourselves to be made self· conscious by 
gawkers and to be molested by strangers without responding 
violently. Women are led to believe that we must put up with 
all of this - without grousing - because we have something 
beside which everything else pales, something that will make 
up for everything. We can have babies! Infertility means 
paying the social price of womanhood only to be denied its 
supposed reward. 

But to promise women children by means of an untested 
technology - that is in fact being tested only as it is used on 
them and their babies - is adding yet another burden to our 
socialization. 

Women are told that· this is a liberating technology which 
offers new options. But the Ethics Review Board which 
advised the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare on 
this procedure and ultimately endorsed it, restricted its use to 
married couples, as did the Norfolk clinic. If this technology is 
to put women in possession of a natural right, what does 
matrimony have to do with it ? To have in vitro fertilization 
immediately tied to restrictions on the conditions under which 
women are to ~ allowed to bear children removes any 
pretense that it will be used to increase 0Ui" o;ltions. 

This is also an extremely complicated technology, hard to 
demystify and requiring highly skilled professionals. There is 
no way to put ita control into the hands of the women who will 
be exposed to it. On the contrary, it locks them and their 
babies even more completely into the high-technology, super-
professionalized medical system. 

Continued from page 1 
AS official as Vice President, is looki'ng forward 
to working with Charlton. 

"I've been asked whether I can work with him 
a 100 times today," he said. "He's affable and 
intelligent. I see not problem at aiL " 

T opkis attributes the silly victory to the 
visibility of the silly campaign. 

"A silly campaign i just easier to do. All he 
had to do was put on a party hat and a sandwich 
board and go out there. He was a lot more 
visible, and people would be talking about him 
after he visited them, " Topkis says. 

"I'm not worried about Jeremy at all. I am a 
little worried about (Todd Thompson , elected 
with Charlton as Activity Fee chairman). He 
doesn't know anything about what he 's doing. 
I'm willing to work with him. 

"I don' t know what Biondi knows about 
Communications, but I understand Meg Honda 
could be a good Public Relations person if she 
wanted to do it." 

What kind of President will Charlton.be? The 
AS people think .he will be serious when he has 
to. 

"I don't believe that he will be silly in the sense 
that he'll screw around a lot," AS advisor Randy 
Woodard believes. "There are serious issues 
and he's going to be dealing with them. This isn't 
to say there aren't issues that can be dealt with 
with humor," he said after _ meeting with 
Charlton for over two hours yesterday. 

Charlton said yesterday he will ask Linda 
Sabo, his opposition in the run-off, to return as 

SBPC representative. 
(He has, of course, promised to appoint 

anyone to any position they create, provided it 
looks impressive on a resume. He appointed one 
student Ambassador to UCLA yesterday.) 

And Montalvo think Charlton might even be 
more effective because he is a silly man. 

"The AS Council has been dominated by 
special interest groups the last three years," 
Montalvo aid. "Jeremy will be able to go into 
someplace and say, 'Look, this is a bad idea . 
We've got to restructure campus programming. 
If I did it , people would say I was out to get 
Dianne Annala , (Director of University 
Events)" Montalvo says. 

Charlton says he has no immediate pla ns, 
other than approval of the budget, which must 
be out in 10 days. He wants to fulfill his promis 
to turn the Revelle College fountain into a 
"Wilderness Preserve," or at least a place with 
plants, and he will hold a press conference 
Monday. 

His "coronation" as AS President will be next 
Wednesday, if the AS Council can muster a 
quorem to officially annoint its successor. La t 
night, the council failed to do that, and 
Charlton's assumption of office will have to be 
an item of "immediate consideration" on th 
council's agenda, AS Vice President Nancy 
Laga said yesterday.
