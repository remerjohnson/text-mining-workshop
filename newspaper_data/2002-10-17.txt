As former Earl Warren College 
resident advisers prepare to move 
out, many Warren residents won-
der who will be moving in to 
replace them. 

Todd Thompson, a freshman at 
\Varren college and a resident of 
Goldberg Hall, said his RA was one 
of the seven fired. Thompson 
wished the residential life office had 
kept him and his floor mates better 
informed of what was happening 
from the starr of the investigation. 

"Just let us know as the days go 
by what's happening with the situa-
tion," he said. "We've been without 
an RA since the investigation 
began [on Oct. 31." 

The seven former RAs were 
assigned to the college's three resi-
dence halls - Frankfurter, Harlan 
and Stewart Halls - and three of 
Warren's four apartment buildings 
- Black, Douglas and Goldberg. 

Inde,cent 
exposer on

Senior Staff Writer 

A series of flashing incidents 
over the past two months has put 
both the UTC area and UCSD 
community on alert. 

San Diego police detective Dan 
Dennis said the outbreak of inde-
cent exposure incidents began on 
Aug. 29. 

"There have been 12 flashings 
since Aug. 29 within the mc area, 

See FLASHER, Page 3 

Many Warren residents said 
their residential life office has kept 
them mostly in the dark. 

"I found out from my suitemate, 
who found out from someone who 
lived on that floor," said Laura 
Ingram, a Warren freshman and 

tewart Hall resident, of how she 
heard of the RA firings. "I didn't 
hear anything from the college." 

Lecturers and clerical workers at 
five University of California cam-
puses-Davis, Riverside, Santa 
Barbara and Santa Cruz-walked 
out of their jobs and into the picket 
lines for a strike that lasted from 
Oct. 15 through Oct. 16 to vent 
their frustrations toward the 
University of California for engag-
ing in allegedly unfair labor prac-
tices. At UC Irvine, only lecturers 
voted to strike. 

The University Council-
The residentia l life office did 

send out an Oct. II letter from the 
resident dea ns to Warren college 
residents, which told residents that 
"we will be making a few changes 
in ou r staffing," and assured resi-
dents that their safety "remains a 
priori ty for us." 

American Federation of Teachers, 
which represents more tllan 4,000 
lecturers on UC campuses, and the 
Coalition of University Employees, 
which represents more than 18,000 
clerical workers ~ystemwide, orga-
nized the two-day strikes.

The strikes, which mostly 
affected the Riverside and Santa 
Cruz campuses, caused the cancel-
lation of numerous classes and 
induced many offices to operate 
witl1 minimal staff. Many parcel 
delivery drivers and construction 
workers at the five campuses 

engaged in sympathetic actions by 
refusing to cross the picket lines 
and diverting packages to holding 
facilities, or by taking the day off. 

At UCSD, 20 union members 
held a one-day "informational pick-
et" on Oct. 15 at the Gilman Drive 
entrance from 7 a.m to about 8:30 
a.m. as a sign of support for the 

Salk professor awarded Nobel Prize 
Brenner rewarded for work in cell development 

ByEDWU 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sydney Brenner, a Salk 
Institute professor and adjunct 
professor to the UCSD Division 
of Biological Sciences, was award-
ed the Nobel Prize in medicine 
last week for his "discoveries con-
cerning genetic regulation of 
organ development and pro-
grammed cell death." Brenner will 
receive one-third of the $1.1 mil-
lion in prize money and shares this 
year's recognition with scientists 
from Cambridge University and 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

Brenner's recognized achieve-
ments stem from his role in esta b-
lishing C. Elegans, a small, trans-
parent worm, as the foremost 
organism in genomics research 

that has led to a series of profound 
discoveries in the area of cell 
development. Research on C. 
Elegans has proved crucial to 
understanding the process by 
which cells naturally die and are 
replaced - a process that fonns 
the basis for understanding cancer. 

Salk Faculty C hair Greg 
Lemke said Brenner conceived the 
idea for placing the small worm 
among research workhouses SI.lch 
as mice and fruit flies because of its 
simple yet multicellular nature, 
which allowed scientists to 
observe genomic processes that 
applied to much more complex 
systems. 

"[Brenner] is famous for his 
enthusiasm for science and his wit, 
and he's very good at explaining 
the excitement of scientists to 
nonscientists," said Lemke of his

Four members of the A.S. 
Council traveled to Washington, 
D.C., to attend a United States 
Student Association board meeting 
Oct. 9. The USSA yearlong goals 
and strategies were finalized at the 
four-day meeting. 

The US SA is the only national 
student lobbying group on Capitol 
Hill. It works under the philo ophy 
that education is a right and cen-
ters its main lobbying goals on fur-
thering access to higher education . 

The purpose of UCSD's mem-
bership in the organization is to 
"ensure that issues that affect 
UCSD students in particular are 
addressed at the national level," 
said A.S . President Jenn Brown, 
who attended this weekend 's meet-
ing along with A.S. Vice President

BRIEFLY 
UCSD study finds deterrent 

to Parkinson's disease 
Researchers of a UCSD study of 

Parkinson's disease found that high dosages 
of a naturally occurring compounds can 
retard the the deterioration of simple human 
functions caused by the disease. 

According to the researchers, Coenzyme 
Q-10 IS a molecular compound found Within 
the mitochondria, a cell component respon-
Sible for converting nutrients into energy. In 
the study, 44 percent of the 80 Parkinson's 
disease patients given high dosages of 
Coenzyme Q-lO were able to carry out vari-
ous everyday activities such as feeding. walk-
ing. dressing and bathing. Study researchers 
say .that the new treatment must undergo 
testing among much larger samples before it 
can be recommended. 

The study, published in the Oct. 15 issue 
of the American Medical Association's 
Archives of Neurology, was conducted by 
UCSD ne uroscience professors Clifford 
Shults and Richard Haas. Flint Beal of 
Cornell University's Weill Medical College 
also contributed to the study. 

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative dis-
order of the brain in which patients develop 
tremors, slowed motion and muscle stiff-
ness. About one percent of Americans over 
the. age of 65 are affected by the disease. 
While some symptoms of Parkinson's dis-
ease can be reduced by prescription drugs, 
no treatment has been shown to slow the 
progressive deterioration in function. 

PETA campaign promotes 
beer to protest milk 

(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -
Fueled by information from a new Harvard 
Medical School study, People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals has decided to bring 
back ItS ad campaign that mimics the well-
known "Got Milk! slogan. PETA's ad asks, 
"GOT ... BEER?!" and states that beer is 
healthier than milk. 

Errata ... 

PETA decided to reintroduce the cam-
paign after it felt its claims about the harm-
ful aspects of dairy consumption were con-
firmed by the Harvard study. PETA said the 
new study presents evidence that beer can 
be as healthy, if not healthier, than milk. 

The ad will run exclusively in college 
newspapers because PETA believes stu-
dents will be the most receptive to the ad. 

PETA's Web site 
(http://llvWN.milksucks. com) contends that 
milk can contribute to acne, obesity and 
actually cause osteoporosis. 

PETA ran a previous version of the adver-
tisement two years ago in several college 
newspapers but was met with difficulties 
from organizations such as Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving. 

MADD was successful in its attempt to 
thwart the campaign before, but because of 
the new Ha rvard study, PETA decided to 
bring it back. 

University leaders sign 
pad against anti-Semitism 

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES - Over 300 
heads of American colleges and universities 
signed a statement declaring zero tolerance 
for anti-Semitic acts on their campuses. 

The statement, sponsored by the 
American Jewish Committee, ran as a full-
page ad in the New York Times on Oct. 14. 
Alarmed by threats and vandalism commit-
ted against Jewish or pro-Israel students 
the signatories announced that any and ali 
acts oj dlscnmlnatlon will be investigated. 

UCLA Chancellor Albert Camesale who 
did not sign the statemen~ said that the' state-
ment implied that there are problems on 
every campus, which he contends is wrong. 
He added that the statement should have 
sought protection for all students instead of 
focusing on Jewish and Zionist groups. 

The statement was made after a sum-
mer when tensions in the rhetorical battle 
for the hearts and minds of students and 
academics over the Palestinian-Israeli con-
flict reached increasingly high levels. 

In the Oct. 14 issue of the Guardian, the article ti tled "Fall Fest rocks RIMACArena" stat-
ed that about 2,000 people attended FaliFest when 5,000 people actually attended. 
In the same Issue, the art!d.e titled "The university's handling of the Warren RAs fi rings 
was Improper and unfair, It was reported that the Warren resident dea ns offered to 
help the eight fired RAs find off-campus housing. They actually offered to help find the 
students on-campus housing.

MEETING #9 
Odober 16, 2002 

Special Presentations 
Director of Lesbian Gay Bisexual 

Transgender Resource Office Shaun Travers 
gave a presentation on what it is like to be a 
member of the LGBT community and urged 
council members to visit the resource office. 

Members of the council participated in an 
exercise in which Traverse portrayed what it 
was like to hide their sexuality. The exercise 
involved standing on one foot. 

"1 wish 1 could have everyone in the world 
do this," said Commissioner of Services and 
Enterprises Jeremy Paul Gallagher . 

After the exercise, Travers welcomed 
questions. Commissioner of Athletics Robin 
Shelton raised a question about gay pride 
parades. 

"I mean no disrespect .. . but in my own 
personal opinion 1 think whatever happens in 
the bedroom stays in the bedroom ... I was 
wondering if you could comment on those 
displays," Shelton said. 

Travers responded to Shelton's question 
by drawing an analogy to Mardi Gras. He 
explained that gay pride parades do not rep-

~esent the "everyday behavior" of the major-
Ity of the members of the LGBT community. 

Travers also answered a question from a 
member of the public about what student 
leaders can do to improve the campus cli-
mate.Travers said that the best thing to do is 
"educate yourself." 

Recognition 
The council recognized the five individu-

als who have been filling the position of 

interim freshman senator since the fifth week 
of spring quarter. 

Reports 
Commissioner of Athletics Robin Shelton 

Shelton reported that he was upset with 
council members for not fulfilling the time 
slots they committed to at the A.S. Council 
barbeque on Oct. 14. 

Shelton also reported that homecoming is 
Oct. 20 at 2 p.m_, and that Triton Tide atten-
dance has double since last year. 

Commissioner of Communications 
Navneet Grewal 
. Grewal. rep~)f[ed that her office is host-
mg a.medla fair on Library Walk from II 
a.m. to 2 p.m. on Oct. 17. The media fai r

Candidates questioned at forum 
Students grill local candidates on election issues 

By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students were asked to 
"Question Authority" on Oct. 14 at 
the second annual Campus 
Cormection F' orum held by the A.S. 
Council and the San Diego 
Re!,rional Chamber of Commerce. 
T he event brought local political 
candidates to campus to interact 
with snldents on issues ranging 
from housing to public cransporta-
tion to the cost of higher education. 

As part of their Get Out the 
Vote campaign, A.S. Council mem-
bers encouraged the students in 
attendance to register to vote; those 
who did were entered into a draw-
ing to win an X-Box video game 
console. 

The panel of candidates includ-
ed city council candidates Michael 
Zucchet (2 nd district), Dwayne 
Crenshaw (4th district) and Charles 
L. Lewis (4th district), as well as 
assembly candidates Sarah Lowery 
(77 th district) and Ri chard J. 
Senecal (75th di trict). 

T he panel gave its opinions on 
issues concerning college srudents, 
a group that event organizers say 
are underrepresented at the polls. 

"1 get the impression that a large 
part of the student body is luke-
wann, politically speaking," said 
Marshall senior Jennifer Lum. 
"People tend not to have very 
strong opinions one way or another 
regarding important issues." 

That political indifference is 
what the chamber and A.S. Council 
are trying to change wi th this event 
and others like it. 

"'Nben you look at the srudent 
population at UCSD, these are all 
likely and potential voters," said 
Mitch Mitchell , SDRCC vice pres-
ident of public policy. "Getting 
them involved in the process now 
will help us as a region in the long 
run, because these are our future 
leaders." 

Srudents were arranged at tables 
in groups of fo ur or five. Questions 
A.S. Counci l members considered 
relevant to students were posed to 
both the candidate panel and the 

audience. Srudents and others in 
attendance responded via an elec-
cronic audience response device. 

T he candidates had the oppor-
runity to reveal their answers to the 
multiple-choice questions before 
the srudents' answer percentages 
were projected on a large screen 
behind the panel. T his format was 
designed to let the srudents and the 
candidates measure their responses 
against one another's. 

Thirteen questions were posed. 
TIle ones eliciting the most spirited 
student response concerned raising 
student fees to counteract the 
Cali fornia budget crisis und how to 
get srudents to get out and vote. 
Some 89 percent of the audience 
responded that it opposed a fee 
raise, while the candidates were 
mixed on the issue. 

Attending candidates hope that 
similar events could pique a histor-
icallyab ent interest to vote among 
srudents. 

"T he reason for lower turnout

gossip and stuff, and we talked to 
our RA," he said. "She told us it 
was kind of hush-hush." 

Warren college Resident Dean 
Claire Palmer reiterated that infor-
mation regarding the RAs and the 
intern were a persormel matter and 
that their privacy was important. 

Palmer said the floo rs that 
were assigned to the seven former 
RAs were re-assigned to existing 
RAs as a temporary addition to 

their normal duties. 
"Each fl oor has been assigned a 

temporary RA that will make sure 
residenrs are getting informa-
tion," Palmer said. 

As for long-term plans, Palmer 
says that her office intends to 
replace the vacancies and will 
begin accepting applications as 
soon as Oct . 18. 

Palmer also acknowledged that 
although the srudents were origi-
nally given five days to move out, 

the students who requested an 
extension were gran ted their 
request. 

"Anyone who needed an exten-
sion was given an extension," she 
said, addi ng that those granted the 
extensions are not being charged 
rent for the additional week. 

Six or the seven former Warren 
college RAs and the one college 
intern were given a one-week 
extension, allowing them to vacate 
their rooms by Oct. 20.

With the Nov. 5 state and loca l elec-

UCSD community will spend the next 
three and a half weeks enduring the baby-
kissing, campaign p~omises and mud-
slingi ng that accompany nearly every 
democra ti c election Defore casting their 
vote for the most dese rving candidate or 
proposition. 

And while many voters have been jaded 
by the American election process because of 
the aforementioned characteristics, ignor-
in,g the constirutional right to select those 
who wi ll be defending the interests of the 
masses is rather irresponsible of the 
American citizen. The right to vote afford-
ed to Americans is a constitutionally pro-
tected right in our nation; it has been a priv-
ile&e that expresses the individual autonomy 
and freedom of expression that many others 
in the world have never and may never

As an institution of the state of 
Ca lifornia, UCSD receives the bulk of its 
funding from the state budget. In theory, by 
selecti ng the governor and state legislarure

have the privilege of shaping - albeit indi-

Political debates, while often poorly 
conducted, still have relevance 

Voters need the chance to see candidates 
explaining positions and showing personality 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

In this country, voter turnout bor-
ders on pathetic. T here are a number of 
reasons for t1l is shamefll l show of apa-
thy: too little t ime, too littl e relevance 
or simply too little initiative. Wha tever 
it is that causes the majority of the 
American populace to take this righ t for 
granted, anyth ing that could breed 
more passion among the electorate 
should be strongly encouraged. 

Political debates, when conducted 
effectively, could be just such a stimulus. 
Although its been qui te some time since 
they did so, one candidate taking on 
another in a display of verbal skill has the 
potential to provide important informa-
tion and inspire more involvement in an 
otherwise indifferent constituency. 

Of course, political debates are by no 
means the cure-all for a complacent pub-
lic. Even with political events filling 6 
o'clock broadcasts and daily papers, the 
majority of those eligible to vote proba-
bly don't know or care enough about 
those who represent them in Sacramento 
or Washington, D.C., to take time away 
from watching their regularly scheduled 
programs. Furthennore, when debates 
diverge from their initial purpose, like 
the recent BiIJ Simon-Gray Davis deba-
cle, they actually detract from helping 
any potential voters. 

In the case of me aforementioned 
debate, instead of addressing the real 
issues, the two candidates instead pro-
ceeded to attack each other, skimping on 
anything of importance. Inquiries about 
taxes and environment were brushed 
aside with the vague language of a sea-
soned politician and businessperson -
hardly the honest and open candidates 

• ... 

NATIONAL 
that Californians deserve. At thei r worst, 
televised political debates can end up 
alienating voters and ruining any chance 
of renewed public interest. 

But despite the potential embarrass-
ment of a boring and ineffective 
exchange, political debates can foster 
some interest that omerwise would not 
be aroused. 'Especially in presidential 
debates, me first glimpse the public gets 
of candidates is often on television. Not 
only can people hear for themselves the 
platforms and positions that candidates 
take, but mey can glean much about me 
character of each candidate as well. 

A classic example is the Nixon-
Kennedy debate of 1960. Where 
Kennedy appeared cool, calm and col-
lected, Nixon was haggard, worn out 
and clearly una ble to wi thstand the pres-
sure of an intense verbal fray. Televising 
the debate allowed the masses to see 
politicians at their best and their worst. 

Barring unfortunate instances in 
which both candidates come off as unsa-
vory (as in the Davis-Simon debate), me 

political debates can serve as an impor-
tant factor in determining preferences 
and helping undecided vo ters. In these 
cases, when the ca ndidates acnmlly do 
get down and dirty on ule issues chat 
matter, tile difference hetween each GIIl -
didate and party can be e lucidated . As a 
result, voters can have a more solid back-
ground before going to the polls, wh ile 
others can have a stronger pLlsh to g'O 
vote at all . The coverage, in combination 
wi th the endless analvsis and discussion 
among cable and bro:;dc:lst new" t:llking 
heads, can help inform ulOse who wcre 
previou Iy linin formed or unclear about 
the issues and tances of the candidate,. 

The democratic process in this COUII-
try is far from perfect, but it will remain 
that way until citizens fin ally decide to 
stop taking the privilege to vote for 
granted. Political debates can be an 
extremely useful tool in helping citi zens 
weigh their choices, make a decision, 
and ultimately show it on eleccion day. 
After the Florida recount fiasco of 2000, 
anyone claiming their vote doesn't coum 
should be tarred and feathered. or at 
least given a withering look. _ 

Debates can be improved and appear 
more like a informative discussion 
instead of a formalized grade school spat 
like me Simon-Davis debate if people 
start taking them more seriously and 
using them for their original purpose: to 
infonn. Ignorance is me most dangerous 
characteristic a voter can possess - it 
leads to electing candidates that are 
unworthy, unqualified and even unwant-
ed. Political debates can contribute to a 
less ignorant, perhaps even more i nter-
estcd voter population. Then perhaps 
the excuses for declining to vote. will 

~essen, .startiryg with the most discourag-
mg claim of all - "I didn't know."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Article ignored Jacobs' 
scientific achievements 

Editor: 
In his upen letter to the dean of 

the Jacobs chool of Engineering 
(Oct. 10 issue of the GUllrdilln), 
Simone Santini raises the question 
of whether interaction with indus-
try is in the best interest of UIC ca m-
pus. He is certainly entitled to his 
opinion on tile matter. 

To add some perspective, about 
one·third of the research at the 
Jacobs School is industry-spon-
sored, while two-thirds of the 
research is funded through sup-
port from the government. I 
believe this is the right balance for 
an engineering schoo!. We have 
found tha t our partnershi ps wi th 
companies add significant relevan-
cy to our research and often 
broaden the focus of what we do. 
For example, the California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology 
brings facul ty and students 
together from across campus to 
work on research. Because the 
J acobs School successfully part-
ners with companies, our students 
often benefit by supplementing 
their educational experience with 
activities such as internships and 
design competitions. 

I was particularly offended by 
Mr. Santini's comments regarding 
Dr. Irwin Jacobs, and it is impor-
tant to set the record straight. 

~ Tl1e 

First, Dr. Jacobs is a highly 
respected scientist and former pro-
fessor at both UCSD and MIT. He 
is a member of the Na tional 
Academy of Engi neering and is 
recognized across the globc fo r his 
contributions to communication 
UICOry. H e is also the reci pient of 
the President's N ational M edal of 
Technology, an award given by ule 
White H ouse for extraordinary 
achievements in the commercial-
ization of technology. The 
American Electronics Association 
has recognized Dr. Jacobs as me 
primary catalyst in shaping the 
wireless technology industry. 

Secondly, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobs 
are truly committed to enhancing 
the San Diego community, and are 
strong advocates for education. 
We at UCSD have been the fortu-
nate beneficiaries. The Jacobses 
have provided support year after 
year for engineering student 
scholarships and fellowships. 
They have demonstrated that 
their interests and passions go well 
beyond engineering by champi-
oning cultural programs on cam-
pus, such as the La Jolla 
Playhouse, and in the San Diego 
community, such as the San Diego 
Symphony. We are and should be 
proud and honored that our engi-
neering school bears the lrwin and 
Joan Jacobs name.

Israel is an apartheid 
state, UC must divest 

Editor: 
J think it is good for all points 

of view on every topic ro be heard, 
especially o ne as complicated as 
divesting from Israel. H owever, 
there is a fi ne line between 
expressing an Opillion and spread-
ing mis-trum s (otherwise known 
as lies). Allow me to very briefly 
co mment on the my th- ri dden 
essay, " UC Support fo r Israe l 
Should Continue" (Oct. 14 issue 
of the Gum-dilln) . 

Israel is not a democracy. When 
a government gives one race/eth-
nicity more rights than another sim-
ply because of their race/ethnicity, 
this is caUed apartheid, not democ-
racy. When Israel says it is a "J ewish 
democratic state," it is not kidding! 
It is a democratic state for Jews and 
not for the indigenous Arab popula-
tion, which has been either forced 
to leave or live as third-cJass citizens 
in numerous ways (you can research 
this yourself). 

The author cites no reference 
for his quote by Arafat calling for 
the full destruction of the Israeli 
state. In fact, all hard evidence 
points to the opposite, since Arafat 
has signed numerous treaties and 
agreements, which recognize 
Israel on 78 percent of historic 
Palestine.

"RETURNING THE GIFT:

ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE SOCIAL BOND" 
Comments and questions by 

PROFESSOR HARVEY GOLDMAN 
Departm~nt of Sociology, UCSD 

What does giving mean? Is it simply a private gesture of civil ity or an 
expression of moral generosity? Is it an "archaic" form of exchanging 
goods? Drawing from his recent book, Le prix de La verite: Le don, I'argent. 
la philosophie (winner of the Grand Prix de Philosophie de l'Academie 

Fran~aise and !he Prix de Philosophie de l'Academie des Sciences Morales 
et Politiques). Professor Marcel Henaff will argue that gift giving is indeed 
the fundamental act of social recognition. It is about trust and dignity. We 
never just give something; we always give ourselves through our gi ft. This 
is why the relation of gift giving is at the core of any political and ethical 
community. Professor Harvey Goldman will offer a critical response and 
engage in a dialogue wilh Professor Henaff on the main ideas of his book.

Students: Create meal point exchange 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

T he EI Mercado ea tery recently opened on Muir's campus, in the home of the 
former late-night Rathskaller. 
Although the newly established 
eatery has regrettably decided not to 
use the artery-clogging fryer that 
used to reside there, it produces 
fresh and appetizing Mexican food 
nonetheless. This columnist's infor-
mal survey of the menu finds that 
while the prices are a tad higher than 
what should be expected (though 
this is hardly a surprise for a housing 
and dining services enterprise), the 
vegetables are consistently crisp and 
juicy, the seating is plentiful and 
open, and there are couches to 
lounge on while digesting and wait-
i ng for one's next class. It is certain-
1y more relaxing than the zoo that 
the Pri ce Center has become 
(regardless of what one may think 
about relentless fee referendum 
pushes, the Price Center has undeni-
ably become a fire hazard due to the 
sheer number of people stuffed into 
so small a space come lunchtime). 

However, the somewhat high 
prices (about a dollar too expensive) 
inspired another thought: Why 
would freshmen buy overpriced lava 
lamps at Earl's Place if they could 
instead get cash from upperclassmen 
willing to buy meal points at dis-
count rates? It could be some sort of 
commodities market - say, it would 
be possible to sell 10 meal points for 
seven or eight real dollars. This 
would not only correct the price gap 
for off-campus students, but would 
be more productive than lava lamp 

purchases for freshmen, Some may 
argue, though, that the meal points 
were bought by the parents of fresh-
men who want to regulate their 
spending habits to ensure that they 
actually would eat meals - but it 
seems that if the freshmen cannot be 
trusted not to blow their meal points 
on lava lamps anyways, then they 
perhaps should not be trusted with 
college life (or being a functioning 
adult) in the first place. 100 bad 
then, that the meal point exchange 
market will never come to pass. 

An e-mail sent to the UCSD community by Dr. Watson's office of Student Affairs on 
Oct. 14 invited students, staff and 
faculty to look over proposed 
changes to Policy and Procedures 
Manual, section 510. The changes 
are notable in that they seem to be a 
concrete expression of Dr. Watson's 
rumored long-standing opposition 
to alcohol at large student events. 
The reworded stipulations clearly 
make it more difficult not only to 
hold on-campus events, but most 
notably, explicirly rewords state-
ments regarding regulations about 
alcohol companies sponsoring stu-
dent events. The revisions seem 
dedicated to making it nearly impos-
sible for such companies to in any 
way fund student concerts. 

For good measure, the proposed 
changes increase the amount of lead 
time before an event from three 
weeks to four, and delegate authori-
ty for making exceptions to the rule 
higher up the ladder of university 
administration, if only to make the 
procurement of the devil's drink by 
UCSD mmors all that more diffi-
cult. However, the regulations now 
explicitly state that "University 
sponsors must be clearly identified 
as the primary sponsor of the event. 
Manufacturers andlor distributors 
of alcoholic beverages may not be 

primary sponsors of campus events." 
As some students involved in pro-

gramming events for UCSO will tell 
you. the reason a campus the size of 
UCSD does not get notable acts is 
solely because of this rather dracon-
ian clause in its alcohol policy that 
prevents alcohol manufacturers from 
blatantly sponsoring events. 
Apparently, it seems a combination 
of Dr. Watson 's rumored disapproval 
of "beer gardens" and university pol-
icy against explicit sponsoring serve 
to dissuade alcohol manufacturers 
from sponsoring good concert acts 
on UCSD's campus - some of 
which would not be even remotely 

. obtainable, regardless of money, 
without the company's help -
because they can get more visibility 
for their dollar elsewhere. While this 
columnist is no partisan for Bacchus 
Oiterally, not figuratively) revelry on 
Library Walk, a healthy, active cam-
pus with popular musical acts and a 
tinge of a lack of sobriety is no doubt 
a good thing for the character of the 
university and the sanity of the stu-
dent population. Also, this would 
save on smdcnt fees (or at least pro-
vide more bang for the dollar), which 
Dr. Watson has been intent on rais-
ing for the past three years. 

But then again, students appar-
ently cannot be trusted wi th alco-
hol - especially when there's an 
omnipresence of heavy security and 
immediate consequences to foolish 
actions. How unfornmate that the 
immediate consequences of foolish 
actions don 't apply to those who 
would oppose liberalizing UCSO's 
alcohol policy for either fears of lia-
bility or protestations of morality. 

This column stands for egalitarian 
principles. As a result. all correspon-
dence (especially UCSD news tips) 
sent to Mr. Wu at e2wu@ucsd.edu 
will be treated with an equitable 
amount of incompetence. 

Letters: Call for divestment based on law 
conlinued from page 5 

Beyond these two glaringly 
obvious mis-truths, there is a lot 
more to this opinion that would not 
stand up to open debate. One, 
there is no association between 
Palestinians and the European 
Holocaust - why should the 
Palestinians have to pay for it with 
their lives, homes, possessions, 
identity? Two, Israel is only 
arguably a strategic ally in the 

Middle East. I would argue that 
Israel creates so much allti-
American sentiment the world over 
that we are shooting ourselves in 
the foot by letting Israel do whatev-
er it wants without impunity. And 
finally, the divestment campaign 
does not seek: genocide of Jewish 
people. It is fundamentally an anti-
racist movement rooted in interna-
tional law and human 
rights. Anyone who researches this

movement would see this to be 
true. 

Next time your paper chooses to 
publish something so blatantly mis-
informed and one-sided, I hope 
you will have something to balance 
it out. As it stands, your paper's 
reputation for ethical journalism 
took a nose dive with this one.

years. In lobbying for its reautho-
rization, thc USSA is also ca ll ing 
for an increase in grant money for 
students, especially the Pell Grant 
as well as subsidized student loans. 

Brown said that USSA is lob-
bying for "an institutionalization 
of the Pdl Grant" so that it 
becumcs a permanent part of 
higher-educ:ltion financial aid. 

Aceor ling ro Nandagopal, the 
USSA board was originally only 
going 10 support an increase in 

grant money, but he worked to 
incl ude subsidized loans as well. 

"A lot of peopl e need these 
subsidi zed loa ns," Nandagopal 
said. By not pushing for more 
unsubsidized loa ns, Nandagopal 
said, "i t would just hurt a lo t of the 
middle class." 

Na ndagopal said the push for 
unsubsidized loans will be strate-
gic. The board decided to begin 
lobbyi ng fo r more grants fi rst, and 
then switch its posi tion to more 
)oans a fter securing an increase in 
grant money. 

Questions have been raised over 

the value of using srud ent fees to 
pay fo r members of the A.S. 
Council to attend meetings out of 
state. andagopal said that sru-
dents have told him it sounds like 
he is taking a vacation with student 
fees. 

"I'm not going on vacation." 
Nandagopa l said. "It is basically 
meetings after meetings . It is COI11 -
ing hack to school and having a 
paper due the next day. It is ;l sac-
rifice fo r UCSD." 

Brown agreed wi th andagopal, 
maintaini ng that the rrip to the 
capitol was not a vacation, bur a ser-

vice to UCSD students. 
"T his is, hands down, one of 

the most import thi ngs tha t this 
A.S. is involved in as far as advoca-
cy for UCSD student rights," 
Brown said. "In terms of lobbying, 
it gives UCSD a voice on a nation-
allevel ... snldents are getting [the 
trip funding] back because we help 
increase grants and financial aid ." 

ccording to Brown and 
Grewal, the four A.S. Council 
members new in Economy Class 
and were allocated $15 per day for 
food . The four shared two rooms 
in a motel.

Labor: UCSD unions vote not to strike Question: 

Lemke also point s uu t that 
Brenner was "a giant of 20th centu-
ry biology" even before his work on 
C. Elegans; his work in 1960 estab-
lished some of the most cruciallillks

"teach-in" and passed out flyers 
sympathizing with union members 
at the other campuses. At UCLA, 
an Oct. 15 article in the Daily Bruin 
reponed that UC-AFr members 
voted this summer to strike. but 
held off on setting a strike date 
pending a vote by C.U.E. 

UC-AFr wants the University 
of California to provide more job 
security to lecturers who are hired 
on three-year contracts following a 
six-year probationary period. 
Negotiations are scheduled for Oct. 
21 and Oct. 22, UC officials said. 

The University of California 
maintains that its lecturers receive 
superior benefits and are paid high-
ly competitive salaries when com-
pared with many better-endowed 
instirutions such as Santa Clara 
University, Stanford University and 
the University of Southern 
California. 

Lecturers teach 25 to 30 percent 
of courses and make up about 12 
percent of the total UC faculty, 

according to UC officials. 
Fred Lonidier. president of the 

Local 2034 of UC-AFr and a 
UCSD visual arts professor. said 
the groups passed out nearly 700 
leaflets in suppon of the strilces on 
the other ampuses. 

Picketing with UC-AFr. 
C.U.E. wants the University of 
California to approve a 15-percent 
pay increase to the salaries of cleri-
cal workers at all UC campuses. 
C.U.E. and the university have 
been in contract negations for over 
a year. 

The University of California is 
cunently offering C.U.E. a 2-per-
cent increase in salary rather than 
the I5-percent increase the union 
wants, according to Sally Hampton, 
a Ii brary assistant at Geisel Li brary 
and president of Local 5 of C. U.E. 

Hampton said her union wants a 
15-percent increase to bring UC 
clerical worker salaries on par with 
the private sector and the 
California State University system. 
She does not agree with the univer-

"My sense is that it's totally 

unacceptable. considering the 
amount of wealth available." 
Hampton said. 

UC officials cite the downturn 
in the economy as a Umiting factor 
when deciding whether to increase 
salaries. 

While most UC campuses were 
affected by the two-day strike. 
union members at San Diego did 
not vote to strike. Lonidier and 
Hampton separately said neither of 
their unions was prepared to join 
the two-day strike. 

"We're not able to strike - nei-
ther C.U.E. nor us," Lonidier said. 
citing a recent change in leadership 
in both unions. "We'd like to. 
believe me." 

UC police officers were on hand 
to keep traffic moving through the 
Gilman Drive and Osler Lane 
intersection, while picketers stood 
on the sidewallc.s and handed out 
flyers. No arrests or citations were 
issued, according to police.

Zucchet said. "First, the politi-
cians don't speak to their issues. 
and two, quite frankly, srudents 
need to take some initiative and 
they need to get involved." 

Whether the srudents and 
candidates saw eye-to-eye or 
not, the event opened the lines 
of communic.tion between the 
two groups, with srudent asking 
additional questions, countering 
the candidates' responses and 
lobbying for causes such as the 
Go Solar campaign. 

"It provided the students an 
opporrunity to be engaged," said 
Joseph Watson, vice chancellor 
of srudent affairs. "It also

Downtown La 
Jolla deli by

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Adults, as well as children, will enjoy the simple yet amazing 
artistry of the last show of the 2002 La Jolla Playhouse season 

T.he story of "Peter Pan and 
Wendy" is one that is an integral part 
of many childhoods, but never before 
nas it become as real or magical as this 
new production at the La Jolla 
Playhouse. 

ll'or many of us, the story is a famil-
iar one through movies, plays and 

musical~ Ths new play, although light 
eIIOugh 'Jor younger children, explores 
the very mature themes that are pre-
PJIlted in JM. Barries play, "Peter 
Pan," and novel "Peter and Wendy," 
"hich jnclude growing, love and loss. 

Wi~ a cast of talented puppeteers 
u\ineo in the Japanese Bunralcu-style, 
i C~c ensemble band and Karen 

6t1 playing the voices of all 25 
Clers, the play seems like it would 

Odd and amy. It rums out that the Play is very odd and amy, but at the 
same time incredibly engaging and 

• J 
somng. 

Impossible, you say, that one 
~man tould successfully perfonn the 
voices of all 25 characters? The criti-
cally acclaimed and honored Kandel 
thrives 3S\ each character. Opening the 

~y as the adult Wendy narrating the 
SlDry that changed her life, Kandel 
4ectivelY' carries out the identity of 

~e young; growing and then mature 
end, throughout the play. Along the 

Way, though, she also manages to 
'ecome aistinct as the charming 

E0ther. c&ttroUing father, protective ana, obsessive Captain Hook and of ourse, ~ bewitching and innocent 
?eter 'an, Each character has a distin-

ish' g accent and manner, and 

Kandel pulls them all off consistently 
and convincingly. 

Amazingly, Kandel can also morph 
herself from a trembling, hunched, 
bitter old woman to a floating young 
girl, innocent and cheerful as she 
twirls around with her eyes toward the 
starry sky. Her facial expressions, her 
mannerisms and her voices make the 
play. 

In addition, the puppets themselves 
were awe-inspiring. Not high-tech 
and flashy like in many new produc-
tions, but simple and highly effective. 
Several characters like Peter and 
Captain Hook are elaborate puppets 
controUed by three puppeteers at a 
time. Others, like John and Michael, 
are simply nightshirts that Oy, sit up 
and even hug their mother. One of the 
most amazing puppets is Nana, the pet 
dog/nanny, who is merely a collection 
of brown fabric, but she is maneuvered 
like a real dog, and then later becomes 
a seductive and dangerous crocodile as 
well. 

Besides the actual puppets, the 
puppeteers themselves have an 
intriguing presence throughout the 
play. In their white Edwardian dress, 
they are obviously there, but are some-
how invisible against the simplistic 
white setting. Besides maneuvering 
the actual puppets, they also use their 
own bodies in innoVlltive manners and 
become the pirate boats or the croco-
dile. Unlike the traditional Bunralcu 
puppeteers, who are invisible in their 
black garments, these world-
renowned puppeteers are also incredi-

ble actors wi th their bodies. 
The enchanting Celtic score of the 

play is especially sentimental and does 
wonders for the play. The songs range 
from incredibly sad to playful and 
innocent. Each one perfectly coordi-
nates with the feelings in the play at 
respective moments and h~lp to eVoke 
further emotions from ~ audiCQCe, 
But the music for this pia isn't m e-
ly meant to be listened to !At one p,art 
in the play it is deman d that the 
audience participate and ng tq. elp 
bring a beloved fairy bacli to Ii Sad 
ballads, seductive tangos. percussion 
and sound effects all give this play • 
unique and touching feel . 

Every aspect of this pi, m tlltt 
actress and the puppete4ts to tile 
music and simple scenery, allow mUch 
room for the imagination, but give 
enough that everything tha is relatec;l 
seems convincing. At the end, when 
the children in the audience are 
bright-eyed with stories of flying and 
far off places, the adults will be push-
ing back tears with lumps in their 
throats with the final lines: " .. . and 
thus it will go on, so long as cbili:lren 
are gay and innocent and heartless."

The A.S. BuZz 
brings pop-punk 
power to UCSD 

II 

Sugarcult will kick off live per-
formances on Oct. 18 at the 
Pub Stage, be there ... or else 

By GAELU FAURE 
Contributing Writer 

S ugarcult are quickly-rising stars in a music scene saturated with hordes of look-alike and sound-alike punk bands. ot only do radio 
charts attest to their latest single 's popularity, but 
UCSD srudents themselves praise the band's 
onstage prowess. 

Erin MacKnight, a Muir senior, remembered 
the band's performance at last years Muirstock fes-
tival. 

"Sugarcult had a lot of high energy. They real-
ly are a great performing band," she said. 

Not only did the students notice the response, 
prograrruning got the same electric vibe from the 
band's perfonnance. 

"'They re-energized the audience. When they 
came on, everybody was standing, dancing, crowd-
ing the stage; they got the audience excited and 
moving," said junior Seth K1onsky, part of the 
Muir College Council committee who produced 
last year's Muirstock. "The committee was brought 
a whole list of band ideas; we listened to Sugarcult's 
CD and found that their sound was the best, and in 
my opinion, they put on the best show." 

Students throughout campus will soon have the 
oppommity to see Sugarcult in action. Following 
the band's popularity with the UCSD crowd, A. S. 
has invited them back to campus to play Poner's 
Pub on Oct. 18. 

"We thought they did a good job at Muirstock 
and so we thought we'd bring them hack," said 
assistant programmer Sean Mandel-Toren. 

Sugarcult formed four years ago, but the band 
from Santa Barbara, Calf., started gaining real 
momenrum by playing the Vans Warped Tour dur-
ing the summers of 2001 and 2002, touring during 
the year with bands like Blink-182, Reel Big Fish, 
Good Charlotte, Goldfinger and Unwritten Law, 
as weU as releasing their single "Bouncing Off the 
Walls" on the soundtrack too "National 
Lampoon's Van Wtlder." Constant touring, how-
ever, is what has earned this band a healthy combi-
nation of both praise and criticism. While some 
critics on one hand criticize the band for looking 
like The Jam while playing mainstream-sounding 
power-punic: anthems, others praise them for their 
energetic songs full of well-crafted hooks. 

In any case, the critics are unanimous in one 
respect: Sugarcult distinguishes itself through their 
fun-filled live shows, both by playing energy-dri-
ven songs and interacting with the public. The 
band is playing a multimde of festival shows this 
month before heading out for a six-week coast-to-
coast tour with The Ataris, so now is a good time 
to catch them playing ill a small venue before 
increasing populariry propels them into headlining 
arenas. 

T his pub show is only the first of the year ina 
series brought to Porter's by A.S. PrograllUlling 
officials hoping to invite three to four bands per 
quarter. The A. S. council tries to find a diverse 
group of bands by taking suggestions from snldents 
through reps from each college. Last year's acts 
included Vani lla Ice and The X-Ecutioncrs, among 
others, bringing big names into a relatively small 
venue and making for an intimate concert-going 

e.~perience . 
The A.S. will also be using the pub show as a 

setting in which to continue its effort to register 
students to vote. Representatives at a booth will be 
available to help register srudents to vote in 
California and answer questions about voting in 
San Diego.

Nothing goes better with a day on the beach than a great lunch, If you happen to wander down to La Jolla Shores to 
catch the last few rays of summer, the best 
way to curb your hunger pains is to stop in at 
"the home of the overstuffed sandwich," 

The Cheese Shop, located just two blocks 
from the ocean on Avenida de la Playa, serves 
up a bounty offood for a variety of tastes. At 
the time of its opening in 1972, the Cheese 
Shop specialized in selling cheeses from 
around the world. 

"It's evolved over time," said Phil Schutz, 
co-owner of the Cheese Shop. 

Today, the shop aims to satisfy customers 
with its array of sandwiches, salads and ca n-
dies from around the world, as well as fresh 
cookies. 

With its well-stocked menu, the Cheese 
Shop is guaranteed to have something for 
everyone. While the "roast pork loin" sand-
wich is the Shop's most famous, traditional 
sandwiches like " turkey, jack and avocado" 
on one of the wide selections of bread may be 
a more favorable choice for some. For the 
adventurous eater, however, there is the 
"smoked salmon" sandwich with cream 
cheese , tomato, onion, dill, lemon wedges 
and capers. Finicky eaters can always resort 
to a peanut buner and jelly sandwich. 

Cheese Shop offers more than just sand-
wiches. Those who don't consider themselves 
sandwich lovers can enjoy organic "mixed 
spring greens" or "chef salad." The Cheese 
Shop'S tarragon mustard dressing is a perfect 
compliment to healthy greens. For a more 
typical deli experience, one can enjoy a side 
of potato salad or cole slaw, among others, 
for reasonable prices. 

The Cheese Shop also includes some 
international shopping for intrepid UCSD 
students, Undoubtedly, every beach-goer 
needs their very own jar of marmite, vegimite 
or "Mrs. H.S. Ball Chutney," all of which 
can be found for sale at the Cheese Shop. 
Need something tamer for your taste buds? 
Indulge in European chocolates from France, 
Switzerland, Germa ny and Italy. 

"There 's no other thing like it," said 
Schutz of the Cheese Shop's eclectic invento-
ry. 

Despite being a La Jolla eatery, the 
Cheese Shop's prices are mostly designed for 
the wallet capacity of a college student. 
Sandwiches range from $3 to $7, but are so 
large that they can easily he split between two 
people. The Cheese Shop's famous oatmeal 
cookies ($0,75) should not be shared, though; 
keep them for yourself - they're like no 
other. 

With it's small, ivy-covered entrance nes-

'The Ring' offers flashy special effects but little substance 
Hardcore lovers of horror film will find a close resemblence to Japanese horror films in content and theme 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Hiatus Editor 

OK, so the horror genre isn't exactly the most serious set of films out there, but when your 
looki ng to be scarcu witless, you're 
not expecting to have thought-pro-
vokll1g dialogue carried by rnean-
III gfu I acting. Then aga in, you do 
tend to expect an entertaining story 
and freaky happenings to surprise 
),ou at every mrn. Thus, with the 
background of "The Ring," a 
remake of the most popular 
Japane e horror fi lm ever, some-
thing fierce is conjured in the scary 
department. Yet in typical remake 
format, what this version does best 
is make you wonder what the orig-
inal had that the new one doesn't. 

Yes, there are plenty of really 
scary scenes that try to get you to 
jump out of your skin , bu t most of

the time the tension IS built on the 
old "go in to the house alone afn:r 
the creepy old guy told you not to." 
This is the kind of thing that is 
absolutely aggravating about hor-

seem to have gone to great lengtlls 
to separate the main characters;

"Mul holland Drive") teases movie

bizarre killings, away when she

annoyingly frequent. Both require 
the potential victim to view a piece 
of media (here, an evil tape), which 
results in a specific per iod of time

which are followed by bloody

When the plot begin to thin , 
there were Oashy visual effects to 
distract the discriminating viewer. 
Victims of an undead girl killer

The words of Dick Dale 
make waves at Geisel 

The mind behind the music that inspired 
"Pulp Fiction" speaks for three hours 
By JESSICA LONG 

Staff Writer 

For those of you who missed Dick Dale's three-hour talk on Oct 8, here is the Cliff Notes 
version ... 

Prologue: Dale began the Surf 
Rock movement in the 1950s and 
has been performing and recording 
ever since. He has been called the 
"King of Surf Guitar," the "Father 
of Heavy Metal," the "Forefather of 
Rock and Roll," and the "Father of 
All the Power Players in the 
World." Dale's music has had a 
strong following for many years and 
many of his songs have been used in 
movies, commercials, TV shows, 
and even the "Space Mountain" 
ride at Disneyland. His most 
famous song, "Miserlou" is not only 
the theme song for the movic "Pulp 
Fiction," but the inspiration as well . 
On Oct. 8, Dale spoke to an 
enthral led crowd at Geisel Library 
as part of the opening of the new 
"Art of Surfing" exhibit. 

T he Story: "Don 't worry about 
yesterday because you've already 
spent it, leave it alone ... Don't 

worry about tomorrow ... Savor 
today like a fine wine .. . Don't sweat 
the small stuff ... My son Jimmy is 
an old soul in a young body ... 
Music soothes the beast ... I don't 
play to musicians ... It's not about 
how fast you play ... Who ever said 
'You've got to love yourself first,' I'd 
like to strangle that person .... We 
perceive things as they shouldn't be 
... You should throw your cgo out 
the window ... You have to love 
someone else first .. . Music is a door 
opener ... Find the beauty in every 
kind of music .. . In Europe, every-
one has a cell phone attached to the 
side of their head like some kind of 
wart ... And everyone has bike ... 
The system hates me ... You should-
n't fight the system ... There are 
more people in the grass roots than 
in the system .. . Its not wise to 
openly fight the system, you should 
do it in a sneaky way ... Be a big fish 
in a little pond ... Your product is 
only as good as your marketing ... 
You get nothing but recognition, 
and that doesn't pay your bills ... No 
drugs, no alcohol, no caffeine, no 
more cigarettes .. . Tarantino creat-
ed "Pulp Fiction" out of the song

Samantha (the incredibly talented 
Zooey Deschanel), are played to 
perfection. Even the most minus-
cule characters have their own iden-
tities and torrured backgrounds, all 
of which intertwine with Katie's to 
make the movie revolve in an inter-
estingly circular pattern. But sadly, 
this depth in each individual makes 
the movie drag and sometimes seem 
unbearably slow. 

Bratt, whose role is one of the 
movie 's deepest, portrays his charac-
ter in a satisfactory manner, but the 
mosr intriguing character by far is 
that of the mysterious and eccentric 
Embry. Hunnam's ability to morph 
into the different manifestations of 
Embry is amazing and even fright-
ening. The character becomes so 
scary that the ending (for those whu 
aren't looking) is a total shocker. 

But sadly, if you've seen the 
poster or the ad, the twi st is given 
away with rhe clever carch phrase, 
"Watch wh o you leave behind." 
Even so, thi s film is a nice break if 
you're tired of recent sca re fests 
that only succeed in grossing you 
out

22 PORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's soccer suffers disappointing loss 
Roadrunners extend their winning streak to nine at UCSD 

By JOSEPH SPANO 
Contributing Writer 

The weekend starred well for 
the UCSD men's soccer team, but 
quickly turned sour when the Cal 
State Bakersfield Roadrunners 
rolled into town and over the men's 
team, winning 5-0 on Oct. 13. 

No. 17-ranked CSUB proved 
too much for the Tritons, whose 
record dropped to 8- 5 overall and 
6-5 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, leaving them 
in second place, one point behind 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

The first half showed no signs 
of a blowout - the Tritons limit-
td CSUB to one goal and were 
only outs hot 9-6. The lone goal 
was scored by Roadrunner Kevin 
Bonilla off a right cross from 
teammate Alex Camacho at 29:25. 

However, truc to their name, 
the Roadrunners put on a display 
of speed tha t left the Tri tons 
behind. At timcs UCSD looked 
short a man because CSUB always 
had an open player downfield. 
T his problem was compounded by 
the Roadrunners' highly accurate 
passing, which rarely missed its 
ta rget. Even so, it was not until 25 
minutes in,o the second half that 
the game fell apart. 

The real damage sranes! at 
73 :29 when Roadrunner Alfredo 
Chavez took a shOt off Joey 
Mejias 's long-distance pass into the 
upper part of UCSD's goal. The 
Tritons switched goalkeepers at 

that point, giving junior Jeremy 
Cookson a break. 

Less than a minute later, new 
sophomore goalkeeper Scott 
Mazurier got a rude awakening 
when CSUB's Drew Rea headed in 
a corner kick from Chavez at 74: 19. 
Less than II minutes later, at 85 :03, 
Roadmnner Greg Knittel stole the 
ball from a Triton defender and 
scored unassisted. The final goal of 
the night came from Shaun Luque, 
who shot in a right cross from team-
mate Andrew Kelly at 87:54. 

As dism31 as the second half 
sounds, the Tritons were not ,vith-
our scoring opportunities. In fact, 
they had many impressive pushes 
that they were just unable to capi-
talize upon. 

Roadrunner goa lkeeper Josh 
Wicks made five saves on nine 
Triton shots. Even though the team 
fai led to score, UCSD had impres-
sive ball control for the first 20 
minutcs of the second period. 

"vVe had lost some confidence 
and couldn't get the final pu h to 
score," said UCSD head coach 
Derek Armstrong of his team's 
inability to follow through on any 
of its drives in the second period. 

CSUB played a very physical 
ga me and was clearly pushing the 
Tritons around in the fir t half. 
However, UCSD steppcd up in 
the second half and thc tension 
between the teams became quite 
apparent. This, mixed with a few 
controversial calls by the referees 
and being outscored 4-0, resulted 

euordian file photo 
looking up: The Tritons stand in second place and one point behind cal Poly 
Pomona in the COO standings after falling to Cal State Bakersfield on Oct. 13. 
in a very disheartening second half 
for the Tritons. 

"1 think we met a tcam that is 
too hot to handle," Armstrong said. 
"We have two weeks off now. We're 
going to do some training and 
hopefully forget about this game." 

Looking ahead, the UCSD 
alumni game will take place Oct. 
19. The Tri tons will return to 
competitive play on Oct. 26, when 
they face Cal State San Bernardino 
for their final home game of the 
regular season.

home run. 

Okay, now lets talk about the 
Giants. Being the faithful Dodger 
fan that I am, I refuse to give San 
Francisco any respecL Although 
the team has been impressive in 
closing out the regular season 
strongly and then marching 
through the Braves and Cardinals, 1 
will not admit that Barry Bonds and 
the Giants deserve to sti ll be play-
ing baseball this season. 

As exciting as I have found 
these playoffs to have been, I can-
not wait to see the Giants lose the 
World Series to the Angel . I cun-
not wait to see the Angels' 20-year-
old reliever, Francisco Rodriguez, 
pitch to Barry Bonds, whn has zero 
clutch hits in his ca reer, and strike 
him Out with a nasry sl ider. 

As memorable as the 2002 sea-

Halos win the World Series.

finished behind Arizona State 
University, which has a roster 
filled with professional-caliber 
skiers . 

"Basically, a second-place 
finish behind ASU is like a first 
place finish," said UCSD team 
captain Tim Odell. 

Freshman Lindsay Baxter, 
who had been a member of the 
UCSD water ski team for just 
four days, landed a 4O-foot jump 
in her first attempt on the ramp 
to help the women's squad solid-
ify a position near the top of the 
standings. 

Junior Peter Merhoff landed 
a 91-foot jump, and his strong 
performance clinched second 
place for UCSD ahead of Cal 
State Sacramento, which fin -
ished in third. 

This is the first time CSD 
has qualified for the national 
tournament. UCSD will be the 
lone nonscholarship team in 
attendance. 

"We couldn't be happier," said 
coach Bill Schneiderwind. "[t 'S 
been my goal, and the go.ll of this 
program since the beginning, to 
send a team to nationals, and now 
we've finally done it. II the hard 
work has paid off. "

Along with the changes at the 
pool, RIMAC Field, which was first 
used in 1989, ha s become a signifi -
cant addition to UCSD, according 
to Felicia Kappes, a two-time All -
American mid fielder for the 
women's soccer team. which she 
played for from 1986 [Q 1990. The 
larger field may have provided 
motivation for Felicia Kappes and 
her teammates during that fall sea-
son, when the Tritons won the first 
women's soccer national champi -
onship in school history. 

RIMAC has also attracted fans 
to watch the soccer teams play at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

"It's nice," she sa id. "Now there 
are lights, and it seems like the 
crowd always comes out for the 
nighr games." 

An increase in attendance at 
recent sporting events has been 
apparent, and Felicia Kappes cred-
its the UCSD athletic department. 

"The university has been getting 
involved to get the students out 

there," she said. "ruCSD Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse I has 
gotten out into the conununity as 
well as the student body."

- Felicia Kappes. women's soc-
cer player from 1985 to 1989 

and McConville are again part of 
the UCSD community. Mike 
returned to the university immedi-
ately after his graduation in 1990 
to earn his master's degree. He also 
lives nearby. His wife Felicia, who 
went to Massachusetts for graduate 
school, and McConville, who 

moved to the state of Washington 
after graduating from UCSD in 
1989, have recently returned to the 
San Diego area and want to give 
back to the university. 

"One of the reasons I moved 
back is because of my experience at 
UCSD,» McConville said. 

The three former UCSD ath-
letes are members of UCSD 's 
alumni association and constantly 
show their support and apprecia-
tion of the Tritons. 

"I t was an awesome experience," 
Felicia Kappes said. "The experi-
ences that you get at UCSD really 
define what a student athlete is." 

As Felicia Kappes' generation 
maintains its memories, current 
Tritons build their own. And 
coday's athletes gain their experi-
ences before UCSD makes its next 
change and the following genera-
tion continues the tradition .

Fall baseball 
makes up 
for regular 

season 

pum's 
points 

~ '~~l 

A s much as I would like to write my col umn about UCSD sports, I feel like 
this space would be inefficiently 
used if it did not talk about the 
World eries. 

The 2002 regular baseball sea-
son, which gasped fo r air and was 
nearly put to death by Bud Selig's 
choke hold. is finally over. Fans 
across the nation (and a few in 
Canada) endured the joke that the 
commissioner called an All-Star 
G ame, and then the major figures 
of talor League Baseball forgot 
abom the ir faithfu l su pporters 
whde the season nearly wil ted away 
due to a strike in August. 

However, we somehow made it. 
And fo rnmatelv for the owners of 
professIOnal basehall tea ms that 
don't deserve a single fa n's loyal ry, 
spons-crazed people like me just 
can't tind it in themselves to turn 
and walk away from October base-
ball. 

This is a great time of year. The 
blowouts have ended with the final 
ga me of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays ' 
season, and fa ns can finally be 
treated to real baseball games again 
as the sport reaches its highest 
plateau (which actually is kind of 
low due to the sorry state that MLB 
has left the game in). 

The exci tement of a pitcher 's 
duel in a pivotal game of a series, 
the call to a hard-throwing reliever 
to help a team get out of a jam in 
the eighth inning, or the 10-pitch 
at-ba t that a util ity player draws is 
what postseason baseball is all 
about. Fans have seen this in the 
past fcw weeks. 

The dominance of the sport's 
best pitcher racking up double-
digit strikeouts during two or three 
games in a seven-game series, or 
the roar of a great Yankee crowd in 
the Bronx rising to its feet when a 
New York pitcher is looking for the 
third and final strike on an oppos-
ing batter, is what postseason base-
ball is all about. Fans have seen - I 
mean have not seen th.is in the past 
few weeks. 

T his season has certainly been 
memorable. The new lows that 
were being set during the regular 
season have been noteworthy. But 
the losses that the Diamondbacks' 
Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling 
suffered in the sweep and the elim-
ination of the Yankees in the first 
round have been even more note-
worthy. 

After the Bronx Bombers and 
the D'uacks were bounced in the 
first round, fans knew that the 
teams that eventually reached the 
World Series would be surprising. 
However, when people found out 
earlier this week that the Angels 
will host the Giants in the 2002 
World Series, they were still sur-
prised . 

The Halo , behi nd the mysteri-
ous powers of the Rally Monkey, 
will play in their first World Series 
in franchise history. Although the 
tea m lacks any kind of experience, 
it doesn 't seem like they need any-
thing else other than that jumping

FORMER TRITONS RETURN, BRINGING 
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH THEM

T imes, they are a-changin'. That can be said for UCSD both on and off the field. Off the field, changes 
can be seen throughout the campus. 
New buildings seem to be sprouting 
up at every corner of campus. Apart 
from the new pillars of concrete and 
the addition of Sixth College, there 
are also new faces in the crowd. 

In Triton athletics, the changes 
have been no less dramatic. Sometimes 
the actual game gets a facelift when the 
rules change, or the personality of a 
team receives a makeover when the 
roster changes and new recruits come 
in while graduating seniors bow out. 
Beyond these routine changes, the 
jump from Division III to Division II 
in 2000 has presented teams at UCSD 
a new level of competition. 

Many of these changes will be 
highlighted this weekend, with for-
mer UCSD athletes displaying their 
talents again during the 2002 home-
coming events. 

This weekend's homecoming -
featuring an alumni cross-country 5k 
run, swim meet, soccer game and water 
polo match - will attract UCSD grad-
uates carrying their personal experi-
ences and memories of Triton athletics. 
Former athletes, such as Felicia 
Kappes, Mike Kappes and Peter 
McConville, aU of whom have vivid 
recoUections of their four years at 

UCSD, will be on campus, giving cur-
rent students an opportunity to find out 
how far the universiry has progres ed. 

Mike Kappes, who was a member 
of the men's soccer team from 1986 to 
1990, still remembers the details of 
his team's four seasons. 

"[Current UCSD women 's soccer 
head coach Brian McManus] had just 
come from England, and he had us 
just doing all kinds of physical exercis-
es," Mike Kappes said. "It was brutal. " 

The former mid6elder continued 
to say that the time spent with team-
mates brought them together, and 
although some of his experiences can 
be shared with current Triton ath-
letes, it was "such a different time" 15 
years ago. Mike Kappes quickly noted 
one obvious difference. 

"There was parking," he said. 
Felicia Kappes, Mike Kappes and 

McConville have noticed other 
changes in the facilities at UCSD. 
McConville, an all-league member of 
the men 's water polo team that won 
three conference titles during his 
tenure at the university from 1985 to 
1989, likes returning to Canyonview 
Pool, where fans come spirited and 
can enjoy beer gardens like they did 
on Oct. 11 . 

"I think it's more official," said 
McConville, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association 1989 Finals Most 
Valuable Pla}'er. "It was less impres-
sive when we were there."

Women's soccer win third straight game 
Tritons set new record in shutout over the Roadrunners 

By CHRISTINE LIM 
Contributing Writer 

Dominance has defined the 
UCSD women's soccer team as of 
late. Their last away game, played 
at U C Davis, was a shutout, and in 
their last two victories the Tritons 
have scored before their opponent. 

The game played on Oct. 13 
was no exception. UCSD hosted 
the Cal State Bakersfield 
Roadrunners and won its third-
consecutive victory. T he Tritons 
shut out CSUB by a final score of 
4-0 after putting the game away 
with three goals just four minutes 
into the second half. 

Ju nior mid fielder Kristen 
Conahan struck first for the 
Tritons at the 32 :33 mark of the 
first half. She scored off a corner 
kick from fellow junior forward 
Shannon Harrelson at the far post. 

Thanks to a Roadrunner hand-
ball in the penalty box, Harrelson 
scored the next goal on a penalty 
shot at the 66:30 mark. 

Shortly after, Conahan took a 
pass ftom senior Lauren Jacobs 
and scored from 25 yards out, hit-
ting the upper left corner of the 
Roadrunners' goal at the 70:33 
mark. 

Seconds later, sophomore 
Christine Kwon assisted a goal 
scored by Harrelson at the 70:51 
mark. The two goals scored 18 
seconds apart set a new record for 
consecutive goals in California 
Collegiate Athletic Associa tion 
history. 

UCSD junior goal keeper Kami 
Poma made three saves in 71 lnin-
utes of playing time. At th e 70:33 
mark, Poma was relieved by 
sophomore Jamie Lautenschleger, 
who contributed two saves herself. 
O n the other end of the field, 
Roadrunner goalkeeper Lindsay 
Bush, despite allowing four goals, 
made six saves.
