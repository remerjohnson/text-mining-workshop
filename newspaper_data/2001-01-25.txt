Campus Life Referendum ~ets Deadline 
New $75 student fee meets both praise and criticism 
-,ALD J. LEE 
ASSOCiate News Editor 

The Campus Life Referendum Committee 
has chosen Feb. 2 as the deadline for any stu-
dent organization or group on campus to sub-
mit funding requests for the proposed Campus 
Life Referendum. 

Commissioned last May by Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson, the Campus 
Life Referendum Committee was created in the 
hopes of meeting the needs of the campus in 
terms of facilities and programming. 

According to A.S. Council President Doc 
Khaleghi, who is also co-chair of the commit-
tee, the intent is to have one referendum that 
would benefit all of UCSD at once. 

"We assembled about 20 student leaders to 
form a committee from various organizations 
over UCSD," Khaleghi said. "The goal was to 
decide on what the specific needs of the cam-
pus were and then from there to put a referen-

dum on the ballot for the students to vote and 
decide on: 

Khaleghi went on to express his belief in the 
need for such a referendum. 

"I think looking at both the extreme needs 
in athletics and university centers helped us see 
that there's a broader need on campus than any 
one group," Khaleghi said. 

So far, talks of an increase in graduate and 
undergraduate quarterly fees of about $75 have 
been common in the committee. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Tom Tucker said no one knows what the final 
number Will be on a proposed student increase 
because it is still in debate. 

Khaleghi said that although there is always a 
fear in raising student fees, generally speaking, 
the campus has been very supportive. 

"Unfortunately the state, which internally 
funds the UC system, doesn't fund student

A.S. Council to 
Fund Anti-
Zionism Week 
Controversial event raises 
questions about money 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Amid objections from the Union of 
Jewish Students, the A.S. Council is funding 
the Muslim Student Association 's Anti-
Zionism Week. to be held next week. 

At ' Iast week's A.S. Council meeting, 
Vice President Finance Matt Powell sug-
gested fu ndi ng the event from a fund cre-
ated in 1994 specifically for controversial 
issues. 

The council voted against Powell's 
motion , and instead decided to fund the 
event through the Student Organizations 
Unallocated fund, the fund through which 
most student organiza tions receive money. 

"I can definitely understand the council's 
reasons fo r it," Powell said. "What they did 
is definitely consistent with the rules that we 
follow." 

The council must fund events and not 
discriminate based on content that students 
or council members disagree with. 

Powell said he wanted to fund the event 
from a different source because he has not 
had a chance yet to educate students on 
the issue of how funding is given to stu-
dents. 

"It may have been easier to address the 
situation this time if we had the funding 
source." 

Jonathan Rotter, a recent UCSD gradu-
ate, said he feels that many council members 
do not see how offensive the term "Ant i-
Zionism Week" is to Jewish students. 

"Certainly they made the claim that 
they're required by law to fund things in a 
content-independent manner:' he said. "But 
it's hard for me to imagine that if someone 
had proposed an anti-Asian week that they 
would have gotten funding. It 's my feeling 
that they don 't understand that, to us, Anti-
Zionism week is equal to Ant i-Semitism 
week." 

Muslema Purmul, treasurer of the MSA, 
agreed with the council vote. 

"I like the way they voted," she sa id . 
"What this club is doing is no different from

J~b's SchoOl Explores Alternative Sources of Energy 
Several projects developed on UC campuses may help with Califomia's recent power crisis 
Staff Writer 

In the midst of California's cur-
rent energy crisis, scientists 
throughout the UC system are 
involved in various energ,}' 
research projects in an effort to 
discover new and efficient ways to 
produce energy. 

These "energy research activi-
ties,· as the university calls them, 
art numerous and varied, dealing 
with nearly every branch of the 
physical sciences. The research is 
taking place entirely on UC cam-
puses and in the nationallaborato-

ries that the university manages 
for the U.S. Department of Energy. 

"The University of California 
and its affiliated nationallaborato-
ries are conducting research 
across a broad array of energy 
technologies that represent a 
marked departure from !resent 
methods of generating an trans-
mitting power," said UC President 
Richard C: Atkinson. 

The innovative research 
includes a project at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in 
"Magnetized Target Fusion: 
which could potentially produce 
cheap fusion energy in a soda-can-

sized cylinder. Another innovation 
is the discovery by UC Berkeley 
scientists of a metabolic switch in 
algae that converts sunlight into 
valuable hydrogen gas. The 
Lawrence Livermore Labs and the 
Davis, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles 
and Irvine campuses are also all 
conducting energy research . 

"While not all of these new 
technologies are going to become 
reality tomorrow, they do hold out 
great hope over the longer term for 
inexpensive and abundant energy 
supplies," Atkinson said. 

UCSD is also involved in an 
energy study. Scientists at the 

Jacobs School of Engineering are 
exploring ways to use sea water as 
a fuel for the generation of power. 
After exposing hydrogen atoms to 
high temperatures in a fusion 
reactor, the product of which, an 
ionized gas called plasma, would 
generate 1,000 megawatts of ener-
gy cleaner, safer and more stable 
than by methods using fossil fuel. 

The Office of Fusion Energy of 
the U.S. Department of Energy is 
funding research investigating pos-
sible methods of containing the 
volatile plasma. Containment of the

Student: 
The increase in tuition 
may be too much for some 
ContInued from ... 1 
affairs projects like our student 
unions, like athletics, like ollr pro-
gramming, so that has to be done . 
through assessment of student 
fees," Khaleghi said. "But I think 
what you get out of the referendum 
will far outweigh however much 
per quarter you pay, whether it be 
around $75, give or take a few dol-
lars." 

According to committee mem-
bers, the increase in funds would 
provide funding for various 
groups on campus, including the 
A.S. Council, the programming 
council, the Cross-Cultural 
Center, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
and Transgender Resource Office, 
the Women's Center, the 
Graduate Student Association , 
sports clubs as well as individual 
colleges. 

Revelle Dean of Student Affairs 
Renee Barnett-Terry said she 
thought that this referendum could 
be the best thing that could happen 
for UCSD. 

"[The Campus Life 
Referendum) will invigorate this 

- campus; she said. 
Khaleghi said the money 

would be given automatically to 
the various organizations and 
groups on campus were it passed. 
Allocation of these funds would 
be determined by their con-
stituencies. , 

In response to allegations that 
administrators will gain more from 
the referend urn than students, 
Khaleghi disagreed. He said he 
believes the administration's 
involvement is solely a supportive 
one. 

"[Myself), as A.S. president and 
co-chair of this referendum, I know 
that this referendum is meant to 

benefit UCSD as a whole; he said. 
"But the money is going directly to 
students; students will see the most 
benefit from it." 

Some students have been very 
critical of the referendum altogeth-
er. 

Opponents are concerned 
about the prospective and current 
students who may not be able to 
afford to attend UCSD with the 
assessment of another student 
fee. 

"We're part of a process; student 
fees have been continuously 
increased to the point where this 
institution is not affordable any-
more: said Vice President Internal 
of the Graduate Students 
Association Kris Bohling, also a 
GSA representative GSA on the 
Student Life Referendum 
Committee. 

"Look at the students that are 
here right now. We're making 
democratic decisions for students 
who don't get to be here because of 
the fees." 

Bohling went on to e~~ress h ~s 
disapproval of the prevailing alti-
tude among most students already 
attending UCSD. • 

"I'm not just against the admin-
istration, ['m against the mmdset 
that says, 'Oh we can afford [an 
additional) $75 a quarter, it's not 
that much , it's not going to affect 
us much:" Bohling said. "Well , it 
may not affect those who have the 
money, but it's really going to affect 
those students who cannot afford 
it." 

According to Bohling, since 
UCSD is a public institution, the 
referendum should acknowledge 
more of the needs of the communi-
ty as well as those of ~tudent~ .. He 
questioned the necessity. of rals~ng

More '5' Parking 
Needed for UCSD's 
Fed Up Students 

There are not enough student parking 
spots at UCSD. This ceased to be news a 
long time ago. However, we at the Guardian 
have realized one thing with the opening of 
the two new on-campus parking structures 
this year: Absolutely nothing is being done 
to alleviate the aforementioned crisis. 

It's the same old song and dance with the 
new structures: scores of empty green and 
red spaces; few or no yellow spaces. Stu-
dents are being taken advantage of. . 

We recently went to the new Gilman and 
Torrey Pines structures during their peak 
occupancy hours for all three types of spots 
- according to Director of Parking and 
Transportation Greg Snee, this is Tuesday 
and Thursday between 11 am and 1 pm. -
to get an idea of how many of each type of 
space are vacant. 

Our count for the Gilman structure: 38 
vacant "A" spots; one vacant "B" spot; zero 
vacant "S" spots and there were three cars 
waiting for S spots. 

Our count for the Torrey Pines structure: 
11 2 vacant "A" spots; 240 vacant "B" spots; 
13 vacant "S" spots. 

True, the structures are relatively new, and 
it may be that not all graduate students, staff 
and faculty know they are open. However, 
they must be parking somewhere. On the 
other hand, the same can be said about 
undergraduates - we must be parking some-
where. For us, "somewhere" means far off in 
the boondocks; people actually have to come 
pick us up in buses and take us back to cam-
pus. 

Why are there no red or green spots in 
the East or Regents lots? Red and green 
permits are more expensive than yellow per-
mits, but why can't students buy red and 
green permits? 

UCSD Parking and Transportation and 
the administration are either ignoring the 
lack of student parking, or they are acting 
ineffectively. 

We at the Guardian propose a simple and 
cheap solution: Get a few pails of yellow 
paint and go to town on some of those red 
and green spots. At least then, all of us will 
be in the same boat. At least then, it will be 
fa ir. At least then, the people to whom the 
unive rsity listens might actually cause 
something to happen.

Catholic Group's Proposal to Make 
Mary IDivine' Creates Conflict 

If petition is succesful, Mary will be elevated to an even higher level, which 
will create a gap between Catholics and non-Catholic Christians 

By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

For centuries, the Roman Catholic 
Church has held the Virgin Mary at a 
higher level than other Christian church-
es. Now, however, over 6 million 
Catholics have petitioned the pope to 
elevate Mary's status to a dangerously 
high level that would make her almost 
equal with Jesus Christ, the fou nder of 
Christianity. 

The Christian religion, at its core, 
affirms that Jesus died so that all people 
may have eternal life. To declare at this 
point that the Virgin Mary's cooperation 
with God and suffering at the cross also 
saved humanity from sin would overturn 
basic Christian beliefs and drive a huge 
wedge between Catholics and non-
Catholic Christians. 

The .special devotion that Catholics 
have for the Virgin Mary stems from the 
fact that she accepted God's will and 
beca me the mother of Jesus. Catholics 
bel ieve that she lived her life without sin 
and, upon her death, was taken into 
heaven, body and soul. She is now seen 
as an intercessor or mediator between 
people and God. 'Although some may 
misinterprel il as such, the devotion that 
Cathol ics have for the Virgin Mary is 
essentia lly different from the adoration 
Ihal they have for God. The Catholic 
Catechism clearly articulates that differ-
ence. 

A group known as "Vox Populi Mari-
ae Mediatrici," or "Voice of the People 
for Mary Mediatrix," is calling on the 
pope to proclaim a new dogma bestow-
ing upon Mary the tit les coredemptrix, 
mediatrix of all graces and advocate for 
the people of God. These lilIes essential-
ly imply thaI Mary uniquely participated 
in Ihe redemption of all people fro m sin 
and Ihat all graces that come from Jesus 
come through Ihe intercession of Mary. 
Adopting such language and proclaiming 
it as 1I1fallibk dogma, which is what Vox 
Populi is calling on the pope to do, would 
bring the ch urch 111to uncharted and 

dangerous territory. 
If Catholics currently want to believe 

Ihat Mary contributed to the salvation 
of people by acknowledging God's will 
and giving birth 10 his son, that is fine. 
Many Calholics have a strong devotion 
to Mary. Many pray to her as an inter-
cessor on a daily basis. Many credit her 
with bringing them closer to God. [f 
Catholics want to give her that extra 
credit, they may, but ('0 force all 
Catholics to accept that idea wou ld be a 
mistake. 

If! help lead a person to God or to the 
church, [ can say that [ have participated

God. We praise her and honor 
her for her willingness to 
cooperate with God, but we do 
not worship her, nor should we 
elevate her to the point where 
she becomes divine. 

in that person's redemption . At the same 
time, however, I would acknowledge that 
the power came originally from God and 
that I was only an instrument of God. 
Similarly, Mary was an instrument of 
God. We praise her and honor her for 
her willingness to cooperate with God, 
but we do not worsh ip her, nor should 
we elevate her to the point where she 
becomes divine. 

Father Rene Laurentin , a French 
monk and leading Mary scholar, was 
recently quoted in the San Diego Union-
Tribune saying, "Mary is the model of our 
faith , but she is not divine. There is no 
media tion or co-redemption excepl in 
Christ. He alone is God." Laurentin's 
words sum up the opinions of the major-
ity of Christians on the matter. 

Mary 's status within the Catholic 
Church is one of the main dividing lines 
between Catholics and non-Catholic 

Christians. 
Pope John Paul [[ , the current leader 

of the Catholic Church, has shown a 
special personal devotion to the Virgin 
Mary. He ~redits her with ~aving his life 
in an assassination attempt 20 years ago. 
At the same time, he has also shown a 
commitment to ecumenism and unity 
among all Christian churches. [n his 
1994 book, "Crossing the Threshold of 
Hope: the Pope devotes three chapters 
to the topic of ecumenism titled "[s Only 
Rome Right?" "In Search of Lost Unity" 
and "Why Divided?" The pope noted 
then that in the first millennium, the 
church was undivided, while the second 

. millennium was marked by division. He 
called for increased unity by the start of 
the third millennium. 

In light of these words, it would not 
make sense fo r him to start this millenni-
um with a proclamation that would not 
only widen the divide between Catholics 
and other Christians, but also cause divi-
sion within the Catholic Church among 
Catholics who disagree with such 
dogma. 

[n his book, the pope stated, "All of 
us, in fact, believe in the same Christ. ... 
So there is basis for dialogue and for the 
growth of unity, a growth that should 
occur at the same rate at which we are 
able to overcome our divisions - divi-
sions that to a great dt;gree result from 
the idea that one can have a monopoly 
on truth." [f the pope were to issue a 
statement that many Christians inside 
and outside the Catholic Church dis-
agree with , and claim infall ibility in 
doing so, he would be going against his 
own words and ideas regarding eCll-
menism. 

The pope is a very intelligent man and 
wise leader of the Catholic Church. He 
should not and will not make a state-
ment that is unnecessary and will cause 
widespread division in the Christian 
world. Christians and non-Christians 
alike look up to him; he is a uniting fig-
ure. A religious crisis in the world is the 
last thing he needs to create.

Bush Chips Away at 
Abortion Rights 
Executive order ends taxpayer support for 
international groups that offer abortions 
By ALISON NOIIIIIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Newly "elected" President 
George W. Bush authored one of 
his first executive orders Monday, 
which bans the use of U.S. federal 
funds for international family plan-
ning sroups that offer ilbortions or 
abortion counseling. As Democrats 
shed tears and Republicans leap for 
joy, middle-of-the-road voler~ 
should take a deep breath and hold 
on tight. 

however, does not logically apply to 
the issue of abortion rights. 

The U.S. Supreme Court, in 
1973's Roe v. Wade and again in 
1992's Planned Parenthood of South-

'eastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, has 
acknowledged that the federal gov-
ernment is obliged to allow abor-
tion clinics to operate and that it 
also must protect the women and 
clinics involved in such services.

sneaky way of chipping away at

It may be argued 
that these funds 
deserved . to be 
revoked simply 
because they were 
being sent overseas, 
and technically Rot's

In fact, these independents seem 

to be getting a nice surprise from 
their candidate: Thus far, it seems 
he is more determined to ban abor-
tion rights than to give the tax cut 
upon which he slipped into office. 

Bush's defense of the controver-
sial executive order plays on a tra-
ditional Republican belief: that 
charitable organizations should be 
responsible for securing and sup-
porting individuals' rights rather 
than the federal government, and 
that private donations can cover 
the costs of pro~rams such as fam-
ily planning chnics. This theory, 

the United States. However, as one 
of only a handful of nations that 
supports a woman's right to choose 
and women's rights in general, it is 
essential that America take a clear, 
finn stance on these issues in order 
to voice concern for oppressed 
women throughout the world. 

In the last decade, violations of 
women's rights have increasingly 
become more visible: The Taliban 
regime in Afghanistan denies 
female citizens essentials such as 
medical care, education, work and 
even the ability to move about

The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

President Bush's Nomination Further 
Divides An Already Fractured Nation 
Attorney General nominee Ashcroft's extremely conservative 
views may negatively impact civil rights and women 
., VISIIAL PATlL 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

As our country begins a new 
millennium with a new president, 
[ sit and wonder what George W. 
Bush was thinking when he nom-
inated Sen. John Ashcroft for 
attorney general. Bush was no 
more right in his choice than AI 
Gore was with his declaration that 
he invented the Internet. 

If America, and, for that matter, 
our new president, learned any-
thing from the extensive battle 
fought in the Sunshine State, one 
thing should be certain: As our 
country enters the 21st century, 
the citizens are greatly divided as 
to how our country should be 
run. With this in mind, the first 
issue on Bush's agenda should 
not be tax reform or campaign 
finance, but domestic healing. 

By this [ mean to assert that 
Bush must prove his ability by 
healing a land greatly divided over 
the turn of events within the last 
two months. However, Bush's 
decision to nominate Ashcroft to 
head the Department of Justice 
solely aggravates the current con-
dition of discord in our country, 
and is quite simply a horrible 
choice for attorney general. 

To understand Bush's mistake, 
one must understand what the 
position of attorney general 
encompasses. The head of the 
Department of Justice is one of 
the most powerful domestic posi-
tions in any president'S adminis-
tration. The attorney general is 
the nation 's top cop and lawyer. 

He is like the Dick Tracy of the 
entire country, supervising the FB[, 
Drug Enforcement Agency, [mmi-
gration Naturalization Services 
and the U.S. Marshals. With this 
position comes the ability to decide 
how to spend valuable money and 
time to combat crime for example, 
Reagan's administration spent 
resources mainly on combating 
organized crimes and drugs. The 
attorney general also has a great 
influence in the appointment of 
judges to the Superior Court. 

So why is Ashcroft a bad choice 
for attorney general? The answers 
lies within his character, which can 
be understood by studying his 
career, and also in the issues that 
have presented themselves as being 
relevant in the next four years. 

Ashcroft's actions have contin-
uously depicted him as someone 
who is not the biggest fan of 
equality. Beginning in 1977, 
Ashcroft opposed court-ordered 
desegregation in the public 
schools of St. Louis and Kansas 
City. In 1983, he opposed a volun-
tary busing scheme in which 22 
school districts in white suburbs 
approved having inner-city kids 
brought to their schools. 

He has vetoed laws that 
would help bring out black voter 
turnout in St. Louis. Ashcroft 
even helped defeat James 
Hormel's nomination to be 
ambassador to Luxembourg 
because of Hormel 's openly 
known homosexuality. Probably 
the largest controversy sur-
rounding Ashcroft lies with his 
opposition of the nomination of 

Ronnie White, a black judge, to 
the federal bench. 

Because of this record, many 
civil rights activists have been 
enraged by his nomination to 
head the justice department, and 
they should rightly be angered. 
After all, Ashcroft may not be a 
racist, but it is obvious his person-
al conservative views are affecting 
his political decisions to the detri-
ment of equality. 

Civil rights activists are wor-
ried that Ashcroft will enforce the 
laws he values and deny the works 
of the past 30 years that strove to 
establish all men as equal. 
Ashcroft responds as any politi-
cian would, saying he will put 
aside his personal differences and 
uphold the law. [ say bologna. ([ 
would like to say something else 
but am not allowed to do so.) 

How can America trust 
Ashcroft to uphold laws that he 
does not believe in, when history 
has shown that Ashcroft defies the 
law and does as he wishes, such as 
he has with desegregation and 
busing? [f America, as George 
Santayana said, "does not remem-
ber the past, [we) are condemned 
to repeat it." [, for one, do not 
want to repeat the harsh times 
when people had to battle for 
their equality. 

Civil rights are not all that are 
at stake, but the issues of women's 
rights and abortions are threat-
ened as well. Ashcroft has forever 
been a staunch supporter of the 
anti-abortion movement. His

that these nations, already lacking 
respect for women's humanity, will 
make any progress toward equality

During his reign at the White 
House, Bill Clinton successfully 
reimplemented these fund ing pro-
grams after Ronald Reagan had 
canceled them. Clinton is also cred-
ited with twice vetoing Congres-

which happened to occur on the 
28th anniversary of the Supreme

to be a grave forecast for what the 
Bush Administration has in store 
for American women. 

Within the executive order, 
Bush states, "It is my conviction 
that taxpayer funds should not be

Unfonunately, it is the convic-

Fire Brings Out the Best and 
Worst in San Diego Citizens 

Shadrach 
Theory 

SHANNON CASTLE 
On my way to school today, 

the OJ on the radio was going on 
and on about the Escondido 
Humane Society fire, which killed 
about 100 animals and left the 
rest without a facility. 

He mentioned that while it 
_ was tragic that so many animals 

lost their lives, it was incredible to 
see the outpouring of suppOrt 
and generosity that ensued. 

All over San Diego coun ty, 
people are donating money, blan-
kets, food , dog bowls, etc., to the 
Humane Society. 

While I somewhat ilgree wi th 
the OJ on the tragedy of the fire, I 
find myself in conflict over differ-
ent feelings about the response of 
our fa ir city. 

Frankly, I find it pathetic that 
San' Diegans will respond to 
something out of the ordinary, 
like a huge fire and a bunch of 
homeless dogs and cats, but fail 
to show any of that generosity 
and compassion on a re)!ular 
basis. 

Obviously, I'm not just talking 
about our love for animals here. 
My point is that every day in San 
Diego, there are people who do 
not have food, people who need 
clothes and people who have 
nowhere to sleep. When you 
zoom out to the world at large, 
the problems become incompre-
hensible. 

The majority of people feellit-
tIe compulsion to do anything to 
help those people, but when a few 
dogs need a home, they break the 
bank to help out. 

While I place some value on 
caring for our animal friends, my 

personal philosophy places far 
~reater worth on human life than 
It does on animallife. 

I don 't see our whole city 
jumping up and down to send 
money to the earthquake victims 
in EI Salvador. I didn 't even hear 
about it on the radio, but I have 
heard three different DJs whin-
ing about the Escondido ani-
mals. 

Though there is a consider-
abl r amount of aid flowing to EI 
Salvador's victims, this brings up 
another problem: It takes an iso-
lated incident of grand propor-
tions to get people to notice. 
Beca use the people that need 
help every day in our city are not 
making international headlines, 
they go ignored. 

There are no benefit concerts, 
no fund -raising bake sales, no 
spontaneous donat ion ~. People 
don't wa nt to help a cause unless 
it's new, exciting and everyone 
knows about it. 

If you w~re planning on scrap-
ing a little off the top of your 
starving student budget to help 
out Escondido's animals, maybe 
you could think a little and find a 
better place for your time and 
money. 

A large pan of the population 
of Escondido, and of the rest of 
San Diego, has no access to 
health care (unlike the dogs), no 
money for food and very poor liv-
ing conditions. 

By the time this column runs, 
I'd be willing to bet that the ani-
mals are doing just fine, and 
there's nothing more you can do 
for them. Expand your horizons a 
little, and look around the rest of 
the city. 

Take this as your wake-up call 
for the daY-To-day concerns of all 
of the two-footed mammals in 
the city. Let's take better care of 
our own species first, and then we 
can worry about the rest.

imposing our political ideologies 
on others by dancing around them 
in a yellow frenzy, we simply threw 
yellow shirts at them. And you did-
n't even bother writing about it 

More unfortunately, Schanz 
mistakes the spirit of the Bacchana-
lia for something productive, claim-
ing that at least for their pan, the 
College Democrats strove to pro-
mote political awareness. About the 
only thing that may be constnled as 
politically edifying would be a 
strong dose of liberal bombast. 
Instead, the listener would get an 
education in liberal rhetoric, and 
would be ready in a flash to lecture 
others on the good life. 

For my part, I would rather 
become politically astute by sim-
ply distinguishing between what is 
said and what is done. If Schanz 
wants people to be politically

said. 

Josh Cooper, another GSA 
member, said he thought th e 
administra tion had too much 
co nrro 1 over the committee and 
the ultimate fate of the referen-
dum. 

"It 's obvious ... they want 
control over what's going on," 
Coopcr said. "They want the 
money to pay for their little pet 
projects, like 50-foot water 
slides and a Price Center 
Expansion that's designed to 
give them more office space, 
instead of going and building 

' their own building with their 
own money and letting student 
money go to things that affect 
studenrs." 

Revelle Council Chair Jen 
Chang recalled the origins of the 
committee. 

"I think it seemed kind of 
intimidating at first because with 
the first couple meetings there 
were all th ese administrators 
there telling us how good this 
1V0uld be without us really 
knowing specific details," Chang 
said. "But now that the meetings 
have gone on, the administration 
really doesn't have a huge part in 
terms of making us go a certain 
way." 

According to Chang, adminis-
trators cannot vote, and students 
do have the power to shape the 
referendum. 

Watson expressed a similar 
sentiment saying that although 
the administration has a deep 

interest in improving the quality 
of student life at UCSD, it has 
kept its distance. 

"One can differ on the role 
the administration has had in 
this," Watson said. "But effec-
tively, once the administration 
has put it on the table and put it 
before the commi ttee it's in the 
hands of the students." 

GSA President Lea Marie Ruiz 
said the GSA has not taken any 
official standpoint on the referen-
dum. 

"Individual members of the 
GSA have their own opinions, but 
the council itself cannot take any 
official stance, because there has 
to be legislation that is voted on 
by other members of the GSA," 
she said. 

Ruiz also said that an 
increase in student fees was a 
necessary evil and that alterna-
tive sources of money were diffi-
cult to find. 

"It's a matter of practicality," 
Ruiz said . "There's this concern 
that we're turning more and 
more to students fo r funding, 
but without a change in legisla-
tion on the state level, we have 
no other options. We're doing 
the best we can with the system 
we have currently." 

Although in support of the 
referendum itself, A.S. Vice 
Pres ident Internal Jeff Dodge 
has been critical of the process 
by which it has been developed. 

"In the beginning there was a 
st rong administrative strong-
hold on the referendum," Dodge 
said. "Although the ad ministra-
tion is less involved, the chairs 
are still very responsive to the 
administration and maybe not as 
much to the students." 

Dodge said many members of . 
the committee find thc referen-
dum process frustrating even 
though they remain optimistic 
that in the end, the students will 
reap the most benefits.

Children of Welfare Mothers Who Are 
Forced to Work Improve in School 

WASHINGTON - Some of 
the welfare-to-work policies 
adopted by states in recent years 
benefit children in low-income 
families by improving their school 
performance, researchers said 
Monday. 

- Requiring single mothers to 
work as a condition of receiving 
cash assistance did not hurt their 
children, as many people had 
feared, the study said. When the 
work requirements. combined with 
other policies intended to reward 
work, led to an increase in family 
income, the children actually did 
better in school than youngsters in 

_ similar poor families that simply 
received cash assistance under the 
old welfare rules. 

"'The new study provides the 
first evidence that some approach-
es to welfare reform - policies that 
simultaneously increase work and 
income - can improve children 's 
lives: said Judith M. Gueron, who 
supervised the research as presi-
dent of the Manpower 
Demonstration Research Corp., a 
nonpartisan, nonprofit group 
based in New York. 

The research focused on chil-
dren 3 to 12 years old in California, 
Florida, Georgia, Michigan, 
Minnesota and Wisconsin. School 
performance was measured by test 
scores and by the evaluations of 
teachers and parents.

increase employment and income. 
But increasing employment alone 
does not appear sufficient to fos-
ter the healthy development of 
children: 

Authors of the report said their 
findings "provide some reassur-
ance" that mandatory employ-
ment programs do not harm chil-

dren of elementary school age. 
Critics of the new welfare policies 
have said that it is impossible to 
know whether welfare and work 
programs would have the same 
effects in a time of recession or 
economic downturn. 

The study examined the effects 
of several programs that provided 
families with extra money or n~n­
cash benefits. The positive effects 
of such policies were 'most pro-
nounced for the children of peo-
ple who had been on welfare for 
two years or more. 

Short-term welfare recipients 
were more likely to have work 
experience and the skills needed 
to obtain jobs on their own. 

The welfare programs analyzed 
in the study began operations 
from 1991 to 1994. Congress 
adopted similar policies for the 
entire nation in 1996. Authors of 
the report said their research pro-
vided a powerful tool for under-
standing how these policies 
affected children.

Merger With Time Warner Over, the New 
AOL Will Lay Off At Least 2,000 Workers 

NEW YORK - The newly 
combined AOL Time Warner 
began a series of steps Tuesday 
meant to streamline the compa-
ny's far-flung operations, includ-
ing the elimination of at least 
2,000 jobs._ 

The job cuts - representing 
slightly more than 2 percent of the 
company's 85,000 workers -
come less than two weeks after 
America Online, the No. 1 
Internet provider, completed its 
acquisition of Time Warner, one 
of the giants of traditional media. 
The cuts come atop the 400 jobs 
the company said last week that it 
would eliminate at its cable news 
network, CNN. 

Besides cutting jobs, AOL 
Time Warner also intends to shut 
down or sell its 130 Warner 
Brothers retail stores. If the stores 
are sold, the roughly 3,800 peo-
ple who work in them would 
become employees of another 
company. If the stores are simply 
shut down, those jobs would be 
eliminated. 

In an interview Tuesday,_ 
Richard D. Parsons and Robert 
W. Pittman, the company's co-
chief operating officers, said the 
2,025 jobs certain to be cut 

would come from units that 
include the America Online 
Internet operation, the New Line 
Cinema film studio, the Time Inc. 
magazine company and Warner 
Music Group, as well as at the 
company's headquarters. A com-
pany spokesman said the layoffs 
were announced internally 
Thesday. 

Besides cutting jobs, 
AOL Time Warner also 
intends to shut down or' 
sell its 130 Warner 
Brothers retail stores. 

The various moves are part of a 
paroxysm of reorganizations and 
executive ' shifts meant to align 
Time Warner's traditional media 
units with America Online's 
Internet operations. 

"It is really about getting the 
company ready to take the next 
step, which means it was two sepa-
rate companies and we want to get 
the redundancy out: Pittman said 
Tuesday. MWe are going to move at· 
a pace that we think no other com-
pany of our size moves on. We are 

going to adopt 'quick, nimble, fast' 
as a corporate culture." 

In terms of percentage of jobs 
lost, the unit that was hit hardest 
by layoffs was New Line Cinema, 
the troubled movie studio. Out of 
roughly 600 jobs, about 100 were 
cut. 

In terms of sheer numbers, the 
unit that was hit hardest was 
America Online, which lost 725 of 
its rou$h~15,000 workers. Many 
of the Jobs eliminated at America 
Online overlapped with positions 
at Time Warner, the company said 
Tuesday. 

Time Inc., the magazine unit, 
lost 40(), of its roughly 13,000 work-
ers. The reductions came in cus-
tomer se.rvice and marketing units. 

The company said about 100 
employees at its Manhattan head-
quarters had been let go beca use 
lheir jobs had become redundant. 
The company said that a small 
number of additional cuts would 
be made through attrition at 
HBO, at the company's cable sys-
tems, at the WB network and at 
the Turner cable networks.

Bush's aides declined to put a

of dollars. 

At the heart of the changes,

More accountability for schools

considerable flexibility in how 
those schools meet those stricter 
standards. Bush also signaled a 
recognition Tuesday that he may 
need to compromise on the most 
contentious element of his plan: 
.Giving vouchers to parents that will 
allow them to remove their chil-
dren from schools that "persistent-
ly fail to perform."

whom she hoped the government 
would help to ·arrest. 

Tribunal officials had hoped the 
new Yugoslavian administration 
would cooperate. The United 
States has said that beginning April 
1, its aid to Yugoslavia will be tied 
to cooperation with the war crimes 
tribunal. 

But Kostunica has made it clear 
that he is reluctant to cooperate 
and has repeatedly described the 
tribunal as a political institution 
that is biased against Serbs. 

Last week, Kostunica upset 
people both at home and abroad 
when he held a meeting with 
Milosevic, his former political foe. 
At a news conference last week, 
Kostunica denied making any deal 
with Milosevic, but he did not say 
what they nad discussed. 

In a statement, his government 
said that in his meeting with del 
Ponte on Tuesday, he objected to 
the tribunal 's basic procedures, 
including sealed indictments. 

He told del Ponte, according to 
the statement, that he sees a danger 
of "selective justice" in the tri-
bunal's operations and that by 
indicting political and military fig-

be," he said, adding that he would 
"take my opinion to the Hill and let 
folks debate it." 

Critics of Bush's plan, including 
teachers' unions, say the voucher 
system - a word Bush carefully 
avoided Tuesday - would siphon 
money away from public schools 
and the students who need the 
cash the most. Vouchers are miss-
ing from an otherwise similar edu-
cation proposal introduced 
Tuesday by congressional 
Democrats, led by Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman of Connecticut. 
Moderate RepUblicans, in their 
own plan , have also stricken 
vouchers, an indication that Bush 
may be forced to negotiate if he 
wants to get the main elements of 
his program through a Congress so 
closely divided between Democrats 
and Republicans. 

"There are parts of this we can't 
abide, but you have to say that the 
core of his proposal - account-
ability - is much needed, and a big 
change," said Amy Wilkins, a policy 
analyst at the Education Thust, a 
non-partisan group that focuses 
particularly on improving the edu-
cation of disadvantaged students. 
"It's a serious proposal, and there is 
a lot to work with."

ures, and accusing mostly Serbs, 
the tribunal was in danger of "lay-
ing collective guilt on one people" 
rather than establishing individual 
responsibility. 

A spokeswoman for the war 
crimes tribunal, Florence Hartmann, 
refused to comment on the tone of 
the meeting between del Ponte and 
Kostunica, and said that del Ponte 
would make no statements until the 
end of the visit. 

The meeting itself was an 
ach ievement. Kostunica had at 
first declined to meet with del 
Ponte, but he changed his mind 
late last week after he came under 
criticism from members of his 
government. All the main parties 
- except his own - of the 18-
party alliance that won elections 
in September and propelled him 
to power, advocate cooperation 
with The Hague. 

Del Ponte brought with her at 
least one arrest warrant linked to a 
sealed indi'ctment of someone 
known to be living in Yugoslavia, 
Hartmann said Tuesday. It will be 
handed over if the authorities 
accept the obligation to keep it 
confidential, she said. 

The prosecutor will meet with 
the Yugoslav federation foreign, 
interior and justice ministers

Shifting Winds Help Cleanup Effort in Galapagos Oil Spiil 
QUITO, Ecuador - With oil 

spills now covering more than 77S 
square miles of normally pristine 
waters in the Galapagos Islands 
and continuing to spread, Ecuador 
has declared a state of emergency 
and is stepping up its efforts to pre-
vent the slicks from contaminating 
habitats that are home to some of 
the world's rarest marine and bird 
species. . 

To the relief of conservation and 
salvage teams working in the area 
of the remote archipelago, a sudden 
shift in winds and sea currents 
appeared to be aiding those efforts 
Thesday. As a result, most of the 

144,000 gallons of spilled oil, 
which had been drifting westward 
toward islands with large animal 
populations, is being drive. in a 
northerly direction, away from 
inhabited areas. 

·We seem to have avoided a 
. tragedy, but we still have serious 

problems ahead of us," said 
Rodolfo RendolT, the environ-
ment minister of Ecuador, to 
which the Galapagos Islands 
belong. Because of the shift in 
wind and currents, he added, "the 
levels of contamination are much 
lighter than had been expected" 
just a few days ago. 

The crisis began a week ago 
Tuesday, when an Ecuadorean 
tanker loaded with 243,000 gal-
lons of diesel and bunker fuel 
went aground on a reef just off 
San Cristobal, the easternmost 
island of the archipelago. Rescue 
teams were able to remove some 
of the fuel, but on Friday night the 
vessel's cargo hold cracked, and oil 
began leaking into the Pacific 
Ocean. 

Compared with environmental 
disasters like the 1989 Exxon 
Valdez oil spill, which involved 
about 11 million gallons, the acci-
dent here is small, But the 

Galapagos Islands, situated about 
600 miles off the Pacific coast of 
South America, are one of the most 
delicate environments in the world, 

. full of species of marine iguanas, 
giant tortoises and penguins that 
are found nowhere else. 

It was precisely that exotic 
diversity of wildlife that led Darwin 
to the theory of natural selection 
and has made the Galapagos 
Islands a shrine for modern-day 
scientists. 

Thus far, the damage to wildlife 
appears to have been minimal. The 
Charles Darwin Foundation, a pri-
vate entity that operates the main 

scientific research station in the 
Galapagos, reported Tuesday that 
only 16 juvenile sea lions, about 50 
pelicans and 20 boobies had been 
affected by the slick. 

Scientists said that the longer 
the oil remained on the surface, the 
more it would block out the rays of 
the sun and oxygen vital to marine 
life, from plankton to fish. That 
could, they said, affect the entire 
food chain in the Galapagos 
Is:ands, with dire results for biodi-
versity in the archipelago.

Slither in the 
New Year 

1 1 

C hances are; ' most Americans spent their Wednesday with the usual proclivities -working, studying, watching the rain fall, maybe refueling 
with a mid-afternoon cappuccino before 
going back to the drudgery of hump day. 
And amid our scurrying, billions of others 
were lighting firecrackers, drinking plum 
wine and watching paper lions dance 
through streets of red and gold. In fact, half 
the globe had already closed up shop, get-
ting ready for the Chinese New Year (other-
wise known as the Lunar New Year, for 
those unwilling to be labeled sinophiles). 
YES, IT IS A BIG DEAL 

There is a large misconception that the 
Chinese New Year wavers under its Grego-
rian counterpart with regard to pomp and 
c;ircumstance. But, one can blame the press 
for that. 

Western media blitzes 24-hour coverage 
from "around the world" with the solar 
New Year, while the lunar New Year might 
get a 2-minute montage on the nightly 
news. True, the "whole" world does nof cel-
ebrate - let alone recognize - the Chinese 
New Year, which would explain the discrep-
ancy in media coverage. However, it also 
suggests that those who do celebrate the 
holiday view it to be less important or sig-
nificant. 

Big mistake. There's a reason why most 

12 

Asian countries don't carry the luster or 
glitz of Paris or New York at midnight on 
January 1. Simply put, it's not that big of a 
deal to them. So, more as a token, they get 
together and ceremonially gong an old bell 
or throw some weird performance piece 
calling for global unity and the like. Many 
are also preparing for the oncoming lunar 
New Year, buying gifts for family and malt-
ing travel arrangements to go back to their 
hometowns. These preparations take longer 
than the West, primarily because the New 
Year is celebrated during a week-long peri-
od, rather than one whopping night and a 
hung-over day. In China alone, government 
officials are expecting 1.6 billion trips to 
occur during the holiday week. Worldwide, 
2.1 billion trips are expected to occur dur-
ing the first three days of the New Year. All 
Asia-bound airlines have added approxi-
mately 20 percent more flights, while bus 
stations can expect 4,000 customers dailr .• 

The Chinese New Year is the Asian

Wu Tang 
"The Clan Strikes Back" 

Sony Music 
St 

When RZA proclaimed on "Wu-Tang 
Forever" that "the next Wu album ain 't even 
comin' out till the year 2G; many scoffed at 
the notion or dismissed it as typical Shaolin 
posturing. Then 2000 came and true fans 
waited eagerly until the release-heavy fourth 
quarter rolled around for RZA's prediction, 
given some four years prior, to be realized . 

The Wu Tang Clan has been hip-hap's 
leading innovator since the early 1990s, when 
they released their seminal debut, "Return to 
the 36 Chambers." Since then, the members 
of the Clan have released several sterling solo 
projects, another group album and appeared 

New Year: 
According to the Chinese calender 
it is the year 4697 
CoIItIMed frGllt ..... 10 
ago there really was no such thing as" ew 
Year's" season. 

WHEN Ism 
Because the Chinese New.Year follows the 

lunar cycle, the dates change every year under 
the Roman calendar. However, the solar year 
is taken into account. Because the lunar cycle 
lasts for 29.5 days, extra months must be 
inserted every few years in order to "catch up" 
with the solar calendar. This can best be com-
pared to adding an extra day on leap year. The 
Chinese New Year starts with the new moon 
on the first day of the year and ends on the 
full moon 15 days later. This 15th day is bet-
ter known as the "Lantern Festival; where 
children parade through the streets brandish-
ing an assortment of colorful lanterns. 
According to legend, the Yellow Emperor, 
Huang Ti, started to compute time in 2696 
with the help of his prime minister. There-
fore, under the Chinese calendar, this year is 
really 4697 rather than 2001 . 

CREATION MYTII 
Historically, there isn 't so much to go on 

in terms of triangulating an academic expla-
nation of the Chinese New Year. What roots 
the East to the lunar calendar is a tradition so 
deeply embedded into its culture, it has 
become a marker of national pride and iden-
tification. Virtually everything drunk, eaten or 
played with has symbolic value. 

The holiday itself carries a nifty little cre-
ation myth concerning a beast named "Nian; 
translated into English as "year; who gets 
hungry for humans after a terribly bad winter 
season. Consequently, an immortal god, dis-
guising himself as an old man, tricks the beast 
into swallowing all the other animals terroriz-
ing humankind. He eventually mounts the 
beast and rides off into the proverbial sunset. 
Before leaving, however, the god warns the 
people to place red lanterns and light fire-
crackers at each year's end to scare away the 
Nian in case it happens to sneak back. 

Not only does this explain the importance 
ofthe color red as well as its exorbitant use of 
firecrackers in New Year's festivities, it also 
uncovers a smart pun on words. "Guo Nian; 
meaning "celebrate the (New) Year," may also 
be translated as "surviving the beast; as the 
word "nian" refers to the mythical creature 
and "guo" carries the double definitions of 
"observing" as well as "passing over." Howev-
er, this creation myth is generally restricted to 
the Chinese, as other Asian cultures who cel-
ebrate the New Year do not share this view or 
may not even be familiar with it. 

on many co!laborative 'projects, all the while. 
spawning legions of Imitators - most of 
whom aren't worthy of carrying 01' Dirty 
Bastard 's urine sample. 

ow the boys arc back with their new 
album, "The W; a bangi~g collection of 
RZA-produced gems that wI!1 have .even the 
most ~keptical Wu fans bobbmg their heads. 

The record features a return to the eerie, 
gritty style so prominently featured on early 
Wu works but which has recently been 
replaced with a more glittery and commer-
cialized sound that attempts to appeal to the 
mainstream. 

"Hollow Bones; one of the album 's best 
tracks, is vintage Wu-Tang at its finest. Over a 
looped sample of a bone-chilling moan, RZA 
couples a subdued bass line with jangling 
strings to provide Ghostface Killa , Raekwon 
and Inspektah Deck with a desolate sonic 
soundscape over which to drop their tales of 
misery. 

Many will mourn the near absence of 01' 
Dirty, one of the Wu's most charismatic 
members. His presence is reduced to a set of 
prerecorded verses thrown together with an 
almost unlistenable Snoop Dogg guest spot, 
since ODB was in rehab for much of the 
album's production. 

Despite the lack of material by the Dirty 
one and the atypical inclusion of guest 
appearances, which - other than the Red-
man verse on "Redbull; only detract from 
the album - "The W" is an impressive col-
lection of tracks and a much-needed return 
to form by the Shaolin MCs. 

- By Scott Burroughs 

ORIGINAL PURPOSE 
New Year's Day is celebrated as a family 

affair throughout Asia. It is considered a time 
for reconciliation, reunion and most impor-
tantly, thanksgiving. The holiday was tradi-
tionally celebrated with a religious ceremony 
honoring Heaven and Earth, the gods of the 
household as well as family ancestors. Conse-
quently, the most vita l ritual concerning the 
New Year was a sacrifice to the ancestors, 
which promised unity among living members 
of the family and a peaceful rest for ancestral 
spirits. Therefore, on New Year's Eve, the 
communal dinner called "weilu," or "sur-
rounding the stove," was held in their honor 
and became a symbol for cohesion and rever-
ence for the past. 

TRADITIONS 
There are a cornucopia of traditions 

involved with the Chinese ew Year. Of the 
more notable, all debts arc to be paid before 
the New Year. Otherwise, one is subjected to 
another year of debt. All sons and da ughters 
arc expected to return to their families, mar-
ried couples generally gomg to the groom's 
famfly. All homes are cleaned thoroughly, not 
only in anticipation of returning children, but 
also as sign of purity within the household. 
Doors are decorated "" ith red and gold cut-
outs with themes of wealth and longevity. 
New Year's Eve is usually spent at home, 
feasting together with traditional dishes such 
as rice pudding and steamed dumplings. Mid-
night is received with firecrackers bursting 
through the streets, ' intended to drive evil 
spirits away. Lights are kept on throughout 
the night, again to discourage evil spirits frum 
entering. 

On'the first morning, children are given 
envelopes filled with money from their fami-
lies, symbolizing wishes for good luck. In 
return, children are expected to wish all 
adults an auspicious and lucrative new year. 
After the whole family gets up, it begins cara-
vaning door to door, wishing good luck and 
fortune to reratives, friends and neighbors. 

Although these customs are primarily 
Chinese, other Asian nations that celebrate 
the Lunar New Year share similar traditions 
with minor variant features. The Taiwanese 
carry a more elaborate tradition with their 
fireworks, whereas Korean children must cer-
emonially bow to their elders before receiving 
their monetary "blessings." 

No matter what the changes in detail may 
be, the East as a whole, if it may be grouped 
as a "whole; considers the Lunar New Year 
to be a time of family reunion and ritual 
pageantry. The spontaneity of deciding where 
to "spend" New Year's Eve is replaced with 
tradition and reminiscence. It might not be as 
"exciting" as millions of couples kissing at 
midnight amidst thousands of fireworks 
under the Eiffel Tower. But hey, at least you 
don 't have to find a date.

'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is more 
than just amazing special effects 
ByUUANDA 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon" boasts an unusually com-
plex cast of heroes, villains and 
heroines. Michelle Yeah and Chow 
Yun-Fat play two warriors who 
conceal their love for each other. 
Debutante Ziyi Zhang counters as 
the seemingly complacent young 
daughter of an aristocrat. 

The film's soothingly exotic 
atmosphere comes from its non-
Western setting. The references and 
symbolism in the movie are proba-
bly lost on a Western audience. 

However, the story deals with 
universal themes. Two pairs of 
lovers have to choose their paths in 
life, toward honor, loyalty, pride or 
love. A legendary sword called "The 
Green Destiny" forms a point 
around which the characters' lives 
revolve. The plot follows the char-
acters and their supernatural fight-
ing moves, which never stop sur-
prising the audience. 

Viewing this film requires a cer-

tain ability to delay gratification: The 
dialogue is subtitled, not dubbed, 
and there is little "surface action" in 
the first 20 minutes. Be warned: Do 
not leave. The action eventually hits 
and takes you so high that you 
might lose sight of your seat. 

We're talking platinum-level 
fantasy-fighting choreography. 

There is a scene in the film that 
might qualify as this year's longest 
flashback. Lean back and indulge. 

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drag-
on" played in independent cinemas 
right before Christmas. It is now in 
general release, much to the annoy-
ance of those who saw it without 
.being prompted by the huge bill-
boards outside the megaplexes. 

Sony has really taken its hat off 
- and opened its money bag - for 
this picture, for good reason. If we all 
give in to our inner desire, scrap our 
food budget and see the movie more 
than once, maybe other films will be 
granted the same privilege and the 
world will become a better and more 
informed place. populated by people 
with the ability to read subtitles. 

MTV production, "Save the Last Dance," 
overcomes low expectations 
By PAULA 8WZMAN 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

We all enter movie theaters with 
preconceived notions. [ waited to 
see "Save The Last Dance." The 
movie got mixed reviews. Some 
said it was good while others told 
me not to waste my time. 

Naturally, [ decided to take the 
risk. Without high expectations, [ 
sat down and got comfortable as 
the lights dimmed. Once the movie 
was over, the lights brightened 
again and [ was thoroughly pleased 
with the time I spent in my ruby-
red theater chair. 

"Save The Last Dance" is a 
story of fulfilling dreams, conquer-
ing fears, falling a little into love 
and, of course, dancing. The plot is 
interesting, attention grabbing and 
led by vivacious characters who 
can, incidentally, all dance 
extremely well . Whatever abilities 
they lack as actors - and at times 
the acting talent does fall short -
are made up for on the dance floor. 
Of course, some scenes were 

cheesy and some of the story was 
unrealistic, but for an MTV pro-
duction, [ was impressed. 

All the little subplots involving 
one character with another make 
for a well-choreo$raphed story that 
was as entertaining as the dance 
routines. What [ loved is that 
despite the obvious conflicts and 
serious obstacles the characters 
have to face, the plot revolves 
around the dance. The predictable 
but satisfying ~nding encourages 
you to confidently accomplish any 
goal, or at least to catch the next 
bus heading for TJ for some club-
bing. 

Considering that "Save The 
Last Dance" is, for the most part, 
a love story, [ would recommend 
this movie for a light-hearted 
night out with the girls. For all the 
Romeos out there, it is a worthy 
first-date movie. Don't expect 
magic to bounce from the screen 
and pluck at your emotional 
chords, but dct expect an interest-
ing story and lots of entertaining 
dance moves.

play Chico State three consecutive 
times March 2 through March 4 at 
Chico, and they play Grand Canyon 
University twice, on March 16 and 
March 17 at home. 

Last year, Todd Scherwin from 
Simi Valley led the Tritons with a 
.397 batting average. Chad Addison 
had .41 RB[s in 131 plate attempts, 
leading the UCSD squad. Matt 
Smith led the team in walks with 
JO and Brian Terrell led the team 
with 13 stolen bases. 

When it came down to who 
could hit the most out of the ball-
park, Tyler Sullivan came out on 
top with six home runs. As for 
pitching, Alexander Cremidan had 
the lowest ERA on the team with 
2.38 and a record of 5-2. Holloway 
led the team in innings pitched 
~ith '60; including two complete 
games. These stats exhibit how bal-

"We're adjusting, we're working 
on a higher intensity level ." Gerck-
ens said. "People have a lot of con-
fidence right now. They believe in 
themselves, they believe in each 
other. The team chemistry at this 
point is probably stronger at the 
beginning of the season ... than 
ever before. It's all new, so there are 
a lot of uncertainties, definitely." 

UCSD is bringing back a num-
ber of top players from last year's 
playoff team. 

Senior Michelle Wilson, who 
batted .366 last year, can be found in 
right field. Senior Jeanine Cordero 
also will be returning, as will senior 
Christina Searing at second base, 
bringing her .579 slugging percent-
age. The always-dangerous sopho-
more Kristin Hunstead will be back 
behind the plate. Juniors Samantha 
Hayes and Kristina Anderson are 
also coming back.

"It really helped out a lot that 
there was not one person to count 
on every day we got out to play." 
said sophomore Enoch Choi. 
"Everyone had to play their part 
for us to win . We had to look for

anced." 

UCSD got a taste of Division [ 
action last year in a game against 
the Air Force Academy. Even 
though they lost 12-3, it was evi-
dent that they could play against 
high caliber teams. The upcoming 
UCSD team will be playing over 40 
games, including numerous occa-

to what we're going to face," Ger-
ckens said. 

Leea Harlan will again take the 
mound and be the No. 1 pitcher. 
She finished last year with a 15-6 
record and a .88 ERA. 

Also in the pitching rotation 
will be junior newcomer Christy 
Martineli . 

"The team has been 
practicing hard, They're 
really focused and they're 
excited about being in a 
conference. "

"We only have two pitchers, but 
a lot of teams only have two pitch-
ers," Gerckens said. "We're not 
going to have the luxury of having 
the third pitcher. We're going to 
have to see." 

New talent coming through will 
also be strong, including up-and-
comers such as Angie Carr in the 
outfield, Amy Mettee in the infield 
and Kim Aggabao at second base. 

"We have some incredible, tal-

sions in which they will have to 
play four games in three days. 

"We really worked hard in the 
off-season to prepare for our 
upcoming sched ule." Holloway 
said. "It's going to take durability 
and hope of no injuries to keep us 
in the playoff run." 

The UCSD men 's baseball 
team will begin its regular season 
against Point Loma Nazarene 
University this Saturday at Point 
Loma. 

Then the Tritons will host Cal-
ifornia Baptist University and 
Vanguard University on Jan. 30 
and Feb. 3, respectively. After that 
the games become back-to-back, 
starting with road games at Uni-
vers ity of Redlands and Concordia 
University on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10 
respectively. 

Be sure to come to as many 
home games as possible to root for 
the team. They are playing numer-
ous weekend games nere at UCSD, 
so come out for a day at the ball-
park.

ented new people." Gerckens said. 
Gerckens understands the chal-

lenge before her team. 
Many tough teams in the CCAA 

will be licking their chops in antic-
ipation of the new kids on the 
block. 

"We'll get hit," she said. "[ know 
we're going to get hit, but [ also 
think we will hit." 

Gerckens believes that her team 
will be strong at the plate and in 
the field, enabling UCSD to keep 
stride with other schools. 

"[ think our offense is going to 
be strong." Gerckens said. "[ also 
think our defense is going to be 
strong. We're just going to see 
how much we 're challenged if 
we're put on the defensive right 
away. Obviously, that's nobody's 
goal. Our goal is to score first and 
put th e other team on the 
defense." 

All in all, it looks as if the Tri-
tons are ready for the upcoming 
softba II season. 

"The team has been practicing 
hard ," Gerckens said . "They're 
really focused and they're excited 
about being in a conference." 

The Tritons' first game will be 
Saturday, Feb. 3 at 1 p.m. at home 
against Biola University.

Ravens: 
Facing' off afainst tough 
Giants defense 
Continued from page 20 
son . 

But, one might argue, the 
Giants can fall back on the arm of 
Kerry Collins. Mter all, he did 
thro~1' for 381 yards and five 
touchdowns last game. But that 
was only one good game, after 
seasons of Collins bring unable to 
live up to his hype and being cut 
by the Panthers and Saints as a 
rcsult of his incptitude. 

The pass rushes of Minnesota 
and Baltimore are like night and 
day. Collins will have considerably 
less time in the pocket, which will 
force him to be quicker, smarter 
and more accurate. His scram-
bl ing ability, howevcr, is not even 
close to the Raiders' Rich Gan-

non, whom the Ravens absolutely 
owned in the AFC championship 
game. 

The Giants offcnsive, impres-
sive as it was against Minnesota, 
docs not pose a lot of big offen-
sive threats that should cause Bal-
timore any worry. 

Baltimore has already handily 
disposed of Ten nessee, whose 
offense was ranked 14th in the 
league; the Broncos with their 
second-ranked offense; and per-
haps what was the most balanced 
team in the playoffs, the Raiders, 
whose offense was ranked sixth. 

The Giants offense may be rid-
ing the momentum from one 
good game, but the Ravens 
defense has been dominating the 
whole season and hasn't allowed a 
rusher to gain over 100 yards 
against them in the past 36 games. 

But the Ravens aren't invinci-
ble. 

They do have a weakness: their

offense. Trent Dilfer, similar to 
Collins, was released from his pre-
vious team due to uninspired play. 
Their whole game plan consists of 
runni ng, running and safe short 
passes. Baltimore'S offensive unit 

But the key difference is 
that the Ravens' offense

one of tho se littl e mo torized 
scooters. 

But the key difference is that 
the Ravens' offense realizes its 
role is to not screw up and let its 
defense take care of everything 
else. 

They do have trustworthy out-

lets in tigh t end Shannon Sharpe, 
who scorched the Raiders last 
week, and in rookie running back 
Jamal Lewis. 

Most importantly, however, is 
the fac t tha't the Raven 's offense is 
not under pressure to keep it 
close. 

The Ravens know their 
defense will keep them in the 
game and give them good field 
position. 

The Giants, on the other hand, 
will be facing what some are call-
ing the best defense ever, and they 
know they will have to penetrate it 
at least once to have a chance to 
Will. 

So the fact is the most exciting 
thing about this year's Super Bowl 
(besides the commercials) will be 
the defensive battle between the 
two teams. There's no question 
that Baltimore has a better 
defense; but what is in doubt is if 
the Giants will be able to contain

the Ravens' mediocre offensive. 
They had better hope so, because 
this year Baltimore is undefeated 
when they have scored 10 or more 
points. 

One last point to consider is 
this: if the Ravens can shut down 
the Raiders - the sixth-best 
offense in the league, in the Oak-
land Coliseum, in front of thou-
sands of rabid, drug-crazed fans 
- then playing the ew York 
Giants, ranked 13th offensively, 
on neutral ground shouldn't even 
make them break a sweat. 

One of the most important 
things to keep in mind about the 
game, however, is that if offers 
about three hours or so to gorge 
yourself on tasty snack foods and 
ch ug beer afte r beer while 
plunked down on your cottch 
with thirty to fifty of your closest 
pals. 

Yo, man-pass .the Funyons and

good. He led the Panthers to the 
NFC championship game during 
his third year. He was a hell of a 
college quarterback. If he remains 
focused, he can make things hap-
pen. He did throw for 3,600 yards 
this year. 

The way I see the Super Bowl 
shaping up is this: The Ravens' 
defense will get a safety some time 
in the first half. They will also cause 
a turnover early on, setting the ball 
up for their offense deep in Giants 
territory, giving them a field goal. 

For these accomplishments, Ray 
Lewis will be named the game's 
Most Valuable Player. Yes, someone 
charged with murder will be named 
the MVP of the Super Bowl. Not 
only that, he will be on the losing 
team - only the second time that 
will have happened. 

The Giants' defense will keep 
the Ravens' offense at bay, aside for 
the field goal, the entire game. 
Kerry Collins and the offense will 
have ~o big plays in the second 
half, setting up two field goals and 
a championship. 

My final score: Giants 6, Ravens 
5.

Continued from ..... 20 

work in the Super Bowl. 
Frankly, the Ravens' offense is 

downright pitiful. Folks, we 're 
talking about a bunch that did not 
score a touchdown during the 
month of October - an entire 
month. 

Trent Dilfer is not a Super Bowl 
caliber quarterback, and he does 
not have the potential to be one, yet 
he is in the big game. He's a nice 
backup, sure, but not a champi-
onShip starter by any means. Why 
do you think Tampa got rid of him 
in favor of Sean King? 

At running back they have 
Jamal Lewis, which is not too bad 
considering he rut;nbled for over 
1,300 yards this year, but he can't 
do it by himself. Plus, the Giants' 
defense will be all over him like 
Bill Clinton on an intern. 

Who elsC' do they have? Shan-
non Sharpe? He is the best tight 
end playing today, but someone 
has to get him the ball. If they put 
Sharpe in as quarterback and have 
him throw the ball to himself,

Miller with his remarkable sea-
son. H is superstitions and 
pregame rituals include wearing a 
particular ankle brace and using 
visualization. Despite having a 
wide array of ankle braces to 
choose from, Miller has been 
wearing the same black ankle 
brace for quite some time. The 
reason? 

"I've been shooting well ever 
since I started wearing it," he said. 

Visualization is a technique 
that many athletes use to help 
them perform well in games. As 
shown by Miller's numbers this 
season, this technique is certainly 
working. 

"My dad gave me an article 
from 'Sports lIIustrated' about an 
Olympic athlete who uses visual-
ization ," Miller sa id. "It works 
really well for my shooting." 

Miller, an art major who does 
a lot of oil painting in his free 
time, is graduating this year and 
has aspirations of continuing to 
play basketball, perhaps overseas, 
after leaving UCSD. He and fel-

maybe they would have a game 
plan. 

The Ravens got extreme ly 
lucky a couple of Sundays ago 
agains t an overrated Oak land 
team in the AFC Championship 
game. If it hadn't been for a lucky 
pass play to Sharp and a turnover 

by the Raiders, they may still be

playing that game as we speak. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, the 
Ravens defense is a 9.8, but their 
offense is not even on the chart. 

The Giants' defense is not 
nearly as good, but their offense is 
a whole lot better. 

On defense, the Giants will not 
have to do much to keep the game 

low senior forward Sam Higgins 
will be attending the Showcase 
Camp in Utah, where coaches 
and scouts will be' watching for 
potential players. So, if the bas-
ketball career doesn't work out, 
what will Miller GO? 

"I guess /,11 have to go out into 
the real world and find a job," he 
laughed. 

What the future holds for 
Miller is uncertain, but in the 
meantime the UCSD men's bas-
ketball team can count on him, 
lucky ankle brace and all, to lead 
the way.

close, but there are high school 
teams that could slOp the Ravens ' 
offense. OK, that may be a little 
much, but what the Giants do 
have to offer will prove sufficieni. 
Hell , look at what they did to Min-
nesota's high-flying attack a cou-
ple of weeks ago. With inspired 
play, they made the Vikings look 
like the Chargers. 

On the offensive side, the Giants 
running game is decent with Tiki 
Barbar and Ron Dayne. Will they be 
able to get anything done against 
the Ravens? Not at all, but that is 
not to say they won't try. 

The difference in this game is 
the Giants quarterback, Kerry 
Collins. 

OK, no more scoffing, or at 
least cut out your boisterous 
laughter. But I think Collins has it 
in him to win this game. 

Many forget the good parts of 
Collins' career and concentrate on 
the bad. Yes, he did have an alco-
hol problem that nearly cost him 
his career. He also simply gave up 
with the Carolina Panthers, mak-
ing him look like a jackass. 

But hey, this is the NFL, home 
of second chances. 

When Collins was not acting 
like a dumbass, he was pretty

Giants' Collins will crack Raven defense will say 
Ravens' code 'Nevermore' to Giants 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

This weekend, the ew York 
Giants and the Baltimore 
Ravens will engage in Super 
Bowl XXXv. 

Who will the winner be, you 
may ask? Well , New York, of 
course. 

The big game this year pi ts 
two teams better known for 
defense than fo r offense. In 
other words. this will not be an 
offensive blockbuster. 

Defense, though, is awesome 
to watch when it is done right. It 
can be just as fun to observe as 
high-flying offenses such as 
those of the Rams and Vikings. 
The question JUSt flips around. It 
IS no longer a wonder how much 
a team will score, but how little 

the opponents will be held to. 
The Ravens have a stellar 

defense. Unfortunately, that is 
all they have. 

The superiority of the Balti-
more defense is not up for 
debate. They have some of the 
best defense in recent memory, 
maybe even as good as the 
Bears' defense in 1985. It is their 
offense that has a problem. 
Defense does win champi-
onships, but you need at least a 
little bit of offense to make 
some points. 

The Ravens' plan so far this 
year has been to have the defense 
hold an opponent's offense in 
check so the Ravens' offense can 
get into field goal range. 

Sorry, but that is not going to

By IIAAC PEARLMAN 
A ssociate Sports Editor 

Anyone who has ever played a 
team sport has heard it; the one 
quote coaches ceaselessly chant as 
soon as conditioning begins: 
"Defense wins championships: 

The Bal timore Ravens have not 
only subscribed to that ideology, 
qut come Super Bowl Sunday, 
they wi ll prove that wisdom's 
inherence by beating the New 
York Giants and winning Super 
Bowl xxxv. 

This prediction may go against 
common sense, picking a one-
dimensional team to beat the 
NFC .champion Giants who 
demolished the Minnesota 
Vikings 41-0 in the NFC champi-
onship game. 

But I say the Giants don 't have 

a chance. 
Yes, New York did set all kinds 

of offensive records last game, but 
that was against one of the worst 
defenses in the league. When they 
try to run against the Baltimore 
Ravens, Giants running backs Tiki 
Barber and Ron Dayne will not 
fi nd the gaps they found against 
Mi nnesota. Instead, they wi ll be 
met with fearsome, hard-hi tting 
Baltimore linemen and lineback-
ers who seem be everywhere at 
once. 

Besides, the Ravens are com-
ing off a victory in which they 
held the Oakland Raiders - the 

o. 1 rushing team in the league 
to 24 yards, this on a team that 
averaged over 150 rushing yards 
per game during the regular sea-

Softball squad to 
continue success 
By ROBERT FUUON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team is 
venturing into uncharted territo-
ry, hoping for a new beginning 
but with the same positive 
results. 

This is the first season that 
the team will participate at the 
competitive Division II level. 

At the Division 1II leve[, the 
Tritons held their own. Just last 
year, they went 25-13 and earned 
a playoff berth. This year's com-
petition will be much tougher, 
but the team hopes to still make 
some waves. 

With the move up to a higher 

division comes something else -
a home in the California Colle-
giate Ath[etic Association. The 
CCAA is regarded as the best 
Division II confe rence in the 
nation. 

"First of all , we're very excited 
about it,n said Triton head coach 
Patti Gerckens. "[ don't really 
know a lot about the conference. 
[ know the teams are strong. I 
don't know if the strength is 

m~r~ in the pitching or in the 
hitting.n

Get ready for a·great season of 
America's pastime, as UCSD's 
baseball team ' gears up for its 
2001 season. 

At the helm of the squad is 
Dan O'Brien, who is starting his 
fourth year as head coach of the 
Tritons. With his help, the Thtons 
compiled a record of 22 wins and 
13 losses last year in Division III, 
and a record of 15-8-0 in league 
play. 

Seven se.niors will hopefully 
lead the 2001 squad to the play-
offs, despite: the loss of experi-
ence with the graduation of six of 

last year's players. The team also 
acquired some top-notch fresh-
man and junior college transfers 
to build a good lineup. Despite 
the moderately young team, the 
Tritons hope to make their mark 
in the beginning of the long sea-
son. 

MAny time you lose six players, 
depth will be lost; junior 
Andrew Holloway said. MThe 
coaching staff has brought in 
some good incoming players and 
junior college players who will be 
thrust into the spotlight, so

Miller is 
Bright -
Spot-
Star is doing his 
best despite team's 
losing season 
ByaolllAC ...... 
Staff Writer 

Most of us have heard the say-
ing "What a difference a year 
makes." In the case of UCS D bas-
ketball forward Cole Miller, one 
year has definitely made a differ-
ence. This season Miller, a senior, is 
shooting a lethal 40 percent from 
three-point land and leads the 
team in points per game, rebounds 
per game, minutes played and free 
throw percentage. So is there any-
thing more the senior could possi-
bly do? Probably not, but his 
tremendous work ethic wil! no 
doubt propel him to even greater 
heights. 

Although the transition from 
Division I!! to Division II has not 
been the easiest for the men's bas-
ketball team, Miller is doing all he 
can to lead the Tritons to victory in 
his final season. The California 
Collegiate Athletic Association has 
proven to be a tough league, but 
Miller sees a lot of positives to 
playing in Division II. 

"The events are more exciting 
because at both home and away 
games, a lot of people come out to 
watch; he said7 "It's also easier to 
win at home in the new league: 

And after looking at UCSO's 
pair of home games last weekend, 
it is easy to see why Miller 
believes in home court advantage. 
Even though the Tritons lost both 
games, they were never out of 
contention in either game, losing 
by 10 points to California State 
University Los Angeles and a 
mere two points to CSU 
Dominguez Hills. Miller led the 
team in scoring both nights, fin-
ishing up the weekend with a total 
of 45 points and nailing eight of 
15 three-pointers against 
Dominguez Hills. 

With just over 10 games 
remaining in the season, Miller 
says that the team has a positive 
outlook and has to remain as com-
petitive as it has been. 

When asked if he feels any 
pressure to put up big numbers 
game in and game out, Miller 
simply said that there is no pres-
sure, but that he does it for his 
teammates. 

M( don't really have to do any-
thing extra; he said. "We have a 
team-oriented offense, so it doesn't 
have to come down to just one per-
son." 

However, head coach Greg Lan-
thier m:ognizes_ the extra effort 
that Miller has put into his game 
since his junior year. 

MCoIe has worked hard in the 
offseason to get better, and he's 
played outstandin~ly well this sea-
son,w Lanthier said. ·You have to 
credit him for that.w 

MHe's always been a hard work-
er,w he added. "The only thing that 
surprises me about him is how 
comfortable he is on the floor 
when you compare this year to last 
year.w 

Aside from hard work. there are 
a few other things that have helped
