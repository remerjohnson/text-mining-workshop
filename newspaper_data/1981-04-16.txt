Third College Day 

Guardiall /111/)10 by PhilifJ Davies 

The weather couldn't have been better for yesterday's Third College 
Day. Hundreds of students and faculty members participated in the 
day-long event, which offered activities ranging from an afternoon 
baseball game to an evening drama re-enaction of the formation of 
Third College. Various fonns of Third World music, food, jewelry and 
clothing also highlighted the day.

Israel: a necessary Jewish homeland and refuge 
Editor: 

I would like to comment on 
a few letters (Guardian, April 
9). }'irst, I am sorry if I upsel 
Nabil Keilani by my use of the 
term anti-Semitic_ I u ed it 
because, in contemporary 
usage, anti-Semitic means 
anti-Jewish, ju t as nowa-
day anti-Zioni t i often 
used a a more ocially 
acceptable ub titute for 
anti-Jewish, whether or not 
Zionism is an is. ue. 

Mr. Keilan i's letter 
contains several blatantly 
false accu ation which are 
so far out that I will not 
bother to comment on them_ 
However, I would like to 
comment on the more general 
misrepresentations which he 
made_ Both his and the new 
iruJicalor's letters attempt to 
re-define Judaism. It is true 
that not all Jews support the 
right of Israel to exist, but the 
fract ion who don't is 
miniscule_ Virtually all 
..ooern Jewish groups, from 
Reform to Orthodox (except 
for a tiny group of right-wing 
fanatics) support Israel. 
Jewish philosophy and 
theology, from biblical 
through modern times, speak 
of the need to dwell in Eretz 
Yisroel. 

On a secular level, Israel 
must exist to provide a 
homeland and a refuge for 
Jews- Israel is home to over 
three and a half million Jews, 
almost all of whom have no 
other place to go. Almost two 
million of them are refugees 
or descendants of refugees 
from Arab lands. They did 
not leave because the evil 
Zionists made them; they left 
because they were oppressed 
and persecuted_ Radio 
Baghdad gave the Arab 
rationale for this on June 17, 
1967: "The Jewish cancer in 
Iraq constitutes a grave 
danger to the pattern of our 
existence." M. Ali Aluba, an 
Arab writer, wrote, "Hitler 
wanted to save his people and 
the world from this 
malignant evil (the Jews)." 
This persecution goes back 
hundreds of years. It has its 
roots in the Koran, Islam's 
holy book , which carefully 
mandates a second cla s 
citizenship for the Jews. 

Mr_ Keilani acknowledges 
that the early kibbutzim 
Gewish collective farms) 
settled on previously 
unoccupied land. I dealt with 
this issue in detail because 
the new i"dicator claimed 
otherwise_ However, he is 
wrong in his assertion that 

.; the Jews drove the Arabs out 
of Israel in 1948. To a large 

. extent, the Arabs left because 
"the invading Jordanian, 
Syrian and Egyptian forces 
broadcast reports urging the 
Arab residents to leave. 
Despite the fact that the 
Arabs had supported the 
Nazis during World War II 
(The Grand Mufti of 

Jerusalem led a recruitment 
drive for them), the Jews 
made every effort to convince 
tht! Arabs to remain in peace. 
An April 26, 1948, British 
police report says, "Every 
effort is being made by the 
Jews to persuade the Arab 
populace to stay and carryon 
their normal lives, to get their 
shops and businesse open 
and to be assured that their 
live and interests will be 
safe." 

Th Arab countries have 
acknowledged their respon-
sibility in this matter. Emile 
Ghoury, the Secretary 
General of the Arab Hi~her 
Committee of PalestlOe, 
stated in the Beirut 
Telegraph, "The fact that 
there are refugees is the 
direct consequence of the 
Arab states in opposing the 
partition and the Jewish 
state." The highly repsected 
London Economist reported, 
"Various factors influenced 
their decision to seek safety 
in flight." There is but little 
doubt that the most potent of 
the factor were the 
announcements made over 
the air by the Arab Higher 
Executive, urging all Arabs 
in Haifa to quit. The reason 
given was that upon the final 
withdrawal of the British, 
the combined armies of the 
Arab states would invade 
Palestine and "drive t heJews 
into the sea," and "it was 
clearly intimated that those 
Arabs who remained in Haifa 
and accepted Jewi h 
protection would be regarded 
as rent~~ades." Haled el Azm, 
the Synan Prime Minister in 
1948-49 recalled in hi s 
memoirs, "Since 1948, we 
have been demanding the 
return of the refugees to their 
homes; but we ourselves are 
the ones who encouraged 
them to leave_" So, the Arab 
countries are responsible for 
the refugee problem. 

Mr . Keilani is also 
incorrect as to the number of 
refugees. In one statement, 
he claims that tlfe Arab 
refugee number in the 
million. Yet he later ays 
that the 1922 census shows 
only 663,000 Palestinian 
Arabs. Report and General 
Abstracts of the Census of 
]922, by J.B. Baron, shows 
32] ,866 Arabs in pre-Israel 
Palestine and 265,535 Arabs 
in non -Israel Palestine 
(including the West Bank), 
for a total of 587,401 Arabs. 
This is ignoring the over 
600,()()() Arab citizens of 
Israel. 

Mr. Keilani's description of 
the borders of Palestine is 
also highly imaginative . 
Even ancient Israel under 
King Solomon controlled 
more territory than the area 
he described. Until recently, 
the Arabs have considered 
Palestine to be a part of Syria.

Editor: 

We would like to take but a 
moment to extend our most 
sincere appreciation to the 
ladies of the National 
Pan hellenic Conference 
sororities. At their meeting 
on the night of April 7, we six 
young men arrived fully 
dre sed in feminine attire, 
and were met with more 
hospitality and good humor 
than we had any right to 
expect. We thoroughly 
enjoyed the affair and it is our 
hope that we contributed to 
the spirit of the evening. 

Thank you, ladies, for your 
charming company.

ROTC increasing its recruits 
WHITEWATER, Wisc. -

a new recruiting poster has 
been popping UP on high 
school bulletin boards around 
the country. Beneath the 
familiar picture of Uncle 
Sam, a caption reads: "Where 
are the dollars for college? For 
the answer, call your nearest 
ROTC office .... " 

Recruiting posters are 
nothing new. But now that 
President Reagan has 
proposed cutting federal aid 
to college students, invita-
tions to join ROTC are 
getting a second glance. 

Is free college tuition worth 
donning military fatigue 
and facing up to four years of 
active duty a(ter graduation? 
Or should one work IS-hour 

hambur~ers 

between classes, to meet high 
tuition payments? 

This IS becoming one of the 
tougher choices faced by 
American college students, 
including those here at the 
University of Wisconsin at 
Whitewater. The academic 
careers of a third of the 
choot's 8,000 students have 

already been jeopardized by 
President Ronald Reagan 's 
proposed student loan 
cutbacks. I t' expected that 
the choot's ROTC ranks of 
250 males and female will 
well next fall. 
ROTC - th Reserve 
ffI ers Training Corps - is 

bouncing back from Ie 
por>ular day of the 1960s and 
1970 ' to re. ue a n w 
g neration of penniless 

students. Though overall 
college enroll men ts are 
falling, ROTC ranks have 
increased 10 percent 
annually since 1979 and now 
total nearly 100,000 
nationwide. 

There are now ROTC units 
on over 400 college campuses, 
while at lea t ]00 more 
money-hungry schools are 
wailing to join their ranks. ]n 
addition, students at 600 
other college' attended 
ROTC cia on neighboring 
campuses. 

You don't need to be a 
recruiter to that ROTC -
whether under the Navy , 
Army or Air Force - can be 
an attracti ve package. The 
government offers some

ROTC is gaining in 
student popularity 
continued from page 2 
students full tuition 
scholarships for four years, 
as well as free books and 
summer work with pay. All 
cadets receive $100 a month 
during the last two years of 
college. 

After graduation, the 
newly commissioned officers 
usually face duty at about 
$14,000 a year with benefits. 

"Students are anxious to 
sign up for ROTC for the 
financial benefits as well as 
the managerial tr~ning we 
give them during their first 
two years," said Army Maj. 
Michael Lindquist, a military 
science professor at 
Whitewater. "We're willing 
to accept their initial 
interests In ROTC in order to 
expose students to what a 
military career is all about." 

Said another Army ROTC 
staff member at the Pentagon 
to our reporter, Michael 
Duffy: "An awful lot of 
students want active duty. 
They want to get out there, 
lead 50 people and command 
a couple of million dollars 
worth of equipment atage21. 
That's why they're in the 
program. " 

Most ROTC cadets aren't 
simply interested in combat 
duty . The vast majority are 
pursuing careers in fields 
badly needed by the armed 
services. The Navy, for 
instance, wants nuclear 
engineers; the Air Force is 
looking for a few good nurse . 

The military i n't missing 
its big chance to capitalize on 
the de per ate camp u 
market. The Army's 
"Expand the Ba e" program 
seek to bri ng 97 new

campuse into the ROTC fold 
by next year. On the local 
level, recruiters are receiving 
cooperation from state 
officials. One Air Force 
ROTC commander recently 
convinced Texas Gov . 
William Clements to declare 
"Texas ROTC Week" last 
month. 

Unfortunately , many 
students don't understand 
that a ROTC contract is 
letfally binding. 

'As a freshman signing up 
for ROTC. you don't think 
that you might have a change 
of heart in the next four 
years," said John Landau, a 
former ROTC candidate and 
now a lawyer with the 
Central Committee of 
Conscientous Objectors. 
"Changes are what college is 
all about, and you don 't 
realize that transformations 
are possible a year or two 
down the line." 

Those ROTC candidates 
who change their mind after 
their sophomore year are out 
of luck. 

Worst of all, students don't 
know that the military has 
'punitively activated' several 
hundred officer candidates in 
the last few years for bad 
grades or poor behavior. 
Instead of simply losing 
eligibility, a student can be 
'disenrolled' from ROTC and 
placed on active duty 
immediately after college. 
Mo t end up chipping paint 
on destroyers or cooking in a

Their chance of making it to

The alarming number of rapes that haveoccured 
on campus recently is a sad and astonishing ::=a of the totally inadequate budgetary 

~ tions that the present A.S. has given this 
problem. jOe's Escort Service has serviced the 
campus for five years. In that time M escorts have 
f!Vet been attacked. This year Joe's populario/ 
incrt!llled over 700 percent. In the fall quarter Joe s 
dicll65 escorts; Mt one was attacked. At the end of

we are all too aware. there were twelve rapes. or 
attempted rapes. Having worked with Joe s. and 
knowing its record. and polJlarity I endourse it as 
the best alternative to the present rape epidemic. 
"We will need at the very minimum SIO.OOO to 
operate effectively next year." is the opinion of 
john Hansen. co-director of Joe's, 

• 2 
Ttu:ougb registration fees each student gives the 

A.S. SIX dollars. Every student also has the right to 
vote for A.S. officers. It is my opinion that the A.S. 
should provide for student welfare here at UCSD. 
The A.S. should be more involved with 
programming activities, safety, and other popular 
areas of interest on campus. Certainly there are 
other vehicles for students to voice their opinions 
about nuclear research. The A.S. is not such a 
vehicle. I feel it is important that the A.S. be more 
roncemed with what takes place here at UCSD 
than what goes on in New Mexico, or Livermore. 

1t3 
The college system here at UCSD is a very good 

concept that has two distinct advantages. First. it 
provides the social atmosphere of a small college. 
The intimacy is that of a small private school that 
cannot usually be found at a large major 
..unwersity. Second, being a major university. 
UCSD receives considerable financial support 
from sources other than from the students. a 
benefit most small colleges do not have. The college 
system at UCSD provides for us the benefits of 
both a large university and a small college.

Alternative. media at .UCSD is important, but 
mu~t be kept In perspectIve. Being the head of the 
Rational Party I must address alternative media in 
a reaJistic, rational manner. The budgets of most of 
the sources of alternative media here at UCSD are 
not exassive. with two major exceptions. One or

The responsibility of providing security for the 
campus should be a function of university. It 
should be funded by, the Campus police. Reg Fee. 
and the Chancellor s office, not the A.S. The 
coordinatio,} of these services can be handled by 
the A.S. Pnmary A.S. funded areas should be in 
providing information seminars and support 
services. Also. ~tivities such as a Rape Awareness 
Week are servIces that educate all students in an 
effort to get at the root of t he problem. The A.S. has 
the contacts and know bow in order to coordinate 
such and effort. 

1t2 
The University of California is definitely well 

equipped to handle nuclerar research because of its 
fine research staff. however it is not in the interests 
of students that they be doing weapons work. 
Instead of making bombs that promote the UC 
motto "let there be light" in a holocostic manner, 
they should use their expertise to develop peacefu I 
non-weapons nuclear technology. Also the degree 
of control the UC has over the weapons lab are in 
name only and should definitely be changed. 
However A.S. priority systemwide should give 
greater concentration on more immediate issues 
such as the institution of tuition, loan decreases 
and grant cuts, and greater student input 
systemwide in decision making processes. On the 
Respect With Perspective slate, Devon Houston as 
External Affairs will pursue these objectives. 

.3 
Actually, students benefit very little from the 

college system. Most of the programs unique to 
different colleges are able to be taken by any' 
student. Any supposed "sense of community' 
generated by the college system is seldom realized. 
Most students associate with one another 
according to the classes they take, and not with the 
college system. However, some benefits in tennsof 
general education requirements and their 
programmatic emphasis afford much weight in 
favor of the colJeAoe system. For me, the personal 
attention gained 1rom my college experience has 
been both supportive and rewarding. 

.4 
Alternative media plays an instrumental role in 

the dissipation of cultural and general information 
that is educative to the student body as a whole. 
Present levels of alternat ive media funding should 
be re-evaluated to assess the effect of increased 
material costs on production levels. Also way to 
expand their readenhip should be examlOed.

The ASUCSD must make an aU·out effort to stop 
rape on this campus . Necessary programs 
(including escort services. educational programs. 
and increased lighting on campus) must be 
provided with adequate resources. However. it is 
neither possible, nor appropriate. for Activity Fees 
to be used on a long-term basis to meet this need. 
Protecting students. and all women, from rape 
must be a priority - but such protection ought not 
to be funded through student fees, just as campus 
police are not funded through student fees. The 
fact that anti·rape programs are forced to turn to 
student fees for support shows the warped 
pnorltles of the administration - warped 
priorities that I, and the members of the Immoral 
Minority slate. will work to change. Police oUght 
not to waste time giving parking tickets and 
developing photographs from demonstrations 
while such major problems go unaddressed . 

.2 
The blind insistence of the Board of Regents on 

continuing UC management of the Lawrence 
Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear labs - where 
every nuclear weapon in the U.s. arsenal 
(including the infamous neutron bomb) has been 
designed - is yet another example of the 
University's near·total contempt for students. UC 
management of the Nuke Weapons Labs has been 
shown conclusively to benefit neither the 
University nor the country. Although I would 
insist on continued Student Body President's 
Council support for conversion or severance of the 
labs. I feel that more substantive action must be 
taken in order to have a real impact in this matter. 
A UC Student Union - the formation of which I 
have long advocated - would bring real pressure to 
bear upon the Regents (through a variety of 
tactics), and force change in this. and ot~r. issues.

- It has been clear for some time that the College 

system has failed in its purposes. The colleges have 
not been able to develop a real sense of community, 
or to act as unifying forces between students and 
faculty. Instead , a situation has developed where 
the only real difference between the Colleges are 
the General Education requirements. The one 
college which aspired to a more meaningful role, 
Lumumba·Zapata College (established by student 
initiative in 1969), has been subjected to mcessant 
attack - and is not but a shell of its original self. 
Now, neither the name nor the reality survive. 
Thus the college system, as it now exists, is 
ineffective and incapable of fulfilling the reat needs 
c:l students. I, and the members of the Immoral 
Minority slate, will work upon election to develop a 
real sense of community - one which can brirIR 
together large numbers of students.

The A.S. will definitely participate in combating 
rape on campus. In doing so, A.S. financial support 
of rape p'revention organizations will be most 
effective If combined with the joint cooperation of 
other campus financial entities such as Reg Fee 
and the Chancellor's office (Associates Fund). The 
A.S . Programming Commission has· received 
funding from the Chancellor's Office in the past for 
such events as the AII·Campus Dance and Spirit 
Night. Having set a precedent, we are optimistic 
that we will receIve continued support and 
cooperation from this direction, especially 
regarding the serious issue of rape. Such programs 
as Joe's Escort Service. classes in use of mace, and 
more adequate lighting are examples of prevention 
measures which should receive substantial 
financial support.

Erik Singer, the student slate candidate for 

Vice President, is currently the Director of the 
Lobby Annex at UCSD. In accordance with 
statewide policy, we believe that the UCSD

Council should fight for an end to UC participation 
in the Livermore, CA and Los Alamos, NM nuclear 
labs.

The four college structure provides definite 

advantages over a campus·wide system. It creates 
small, personalized atmospheres while facilitating 
accessibility to individual administration. These 
advant~s can best be maximized if taken in 
conjunction with programs such as a stronger 
Intercollegiate Program which would provide for a 
sorely needed campus·wide unity.

The univers~srting provides the student with 

concepts and s he 18 unlikely to get in the

some of Voz Fro"t,nlo'S and Mill i"dicator's 
politics. I do feel that it is important the U.C.S.D

Rape is a tragic and violent, yet completely 
unnecessary crime. Those who commit rape are 
certainly mentally disturbed. It is hard in my mind 
to establish a "level of commitment" to stop rape. 
No cost is too large to stop rape. Any rape, even one 
rape is too many. 

UCSD is badly in need of a protective escort 
service to protect both men and women after dark. 
It is my opinion however, that the fund for this 
protection ervice should not come from the 
Associated Students. Student activity fees should 
not be used to pay for the establishment of nightly 
protection service. The funding for a campus 
security/escort service should come from the 
Administration. Chancellor Atkinson shou ld be, 
ready and willing to fund an escort ervice_ Rape is 
not a student problem. Rape is a societal problem. 
Anybody can be raped. including faculty and 
administration .

The University of California is presently 

involved in the creation and construction of 
nuclear weapons at two plants, one in Livermore, 
California. and the other in Los Alamos, New 
Mexico. This involvement lends legitimacy to the 
nuclear weapons cause and blemishes the 
University name. It has never been the task nor the 
goal of education to create military equipment, 
especially equipment with the specific purpose of 
exterminating huge amounts of people. The 
financial benefits to the University do not 
outweigh th moral costs. 

[f the University were to pull out of the nuclear 
weapons business, I hardly think the nation, or we 
as students and people, would suffer great loss. 

As President. J would strongly urge that the 
University no lon~er support, or participate in, the 
nuclear weapons mdustry.

The college system plays an important 

educational and social role in the development of 
the underclassmen at UCSD. 

My experience at Warren Colle~e was a positive 
one. In the dorms r not only hved with other 
Warren College students. but engaged in many 
extracurricu lar acti vi ties with these people as 
well. 

In short , I support the college system, because it 
provides a base for underclassmen to fit into UCSD 
before they become involved in their major 
departments as upperclassmen.

I would like to i'lcrease funding to all alternative 

media at UCSD. I lind the alternative media on 
campus to be a valuable and insightful ource of 
information. They also provide information and 
perspectives that are not normally exposed in the

I believe that one of the priority issues that the 
AS must deal with this year, is work towards the 
ending of rapes and attacks on women at UCSD. 
There are many awareness programs that the AS 
can institute, but the mo t important method of 
bringing an end to this problem is to institute an 
effective escort service. This should not be a 
volunteer program; it should be staffed with paid, 
profe ional escorts . Student escort services with 
paid staff have been very succes ful in stopping 
rape problems at other UC's and colleges across the 
state. Students at these other campuses are not 
required to pay for this vital service. The 
administration should not expect students to enroll 
at this univer ity, and then be so endangered at 
night , not to be able to cross campus alone. It is the 
responsibility of the chancellor and/ or the campus 
police department to fund such a program. 

1t2 
If you look at every referendum or vote that has 

been taken at UCSD regarding the nu ke lab issue, 
it shows that students have consistently been 
opposed to the idea that the University of 
California is integrally connected with the 
laboratories that have produced every type of 
nuclear weapon in the US arsenal. I would instruct 
the SBPC representative to work on the Student 
Body President's Council in cooperation with the 
group statewide that has been dealing with this 
issue during the past several years . This group 
being the UC Nuclear Weapons Lab Conversion 
Project . As far as whether thi mean fighting for 
management of the labs, or severance, that will 
have to be dealt with in SBPC. They will have to 
consider the mo t feasible option, and act in 
accordance with the wishes of the students at all 
nine UC campu es. 

#3 
The entire idea of a college ystem i what makes 

UCSD unique in comparison with any other UC. 
The benefit that result from such a plan are 
numerous. 

The sense of belonging and community that is 
created by each college is one of the bigge t 
advantages. It is easier to meet and work with 
other students and admini tration in a small 
college atmosphere. You receive much more 
individual attention than is po sible in a large 
university where all the students have to utilize 
the same services. I think this is best exemplified 
where students at UCLA or UC Berkeley find they 
can never get in to see an academic advisor and 
constantly feel the alienation of being just one 
individual in a huge group of people that can never 
be heard . 

.4 
I think the need for students to have an 

opportunity to receive different perspectives on 
every i ue is very beneficial. I'd like to see 
contmued funding of a much alternative media as 
possible, but a to what levels that will be can only 
be determined when we see what the final budget 
will allow. My personal feeling about the three

The Chancellor's actions 

toward the social sciences 
and humanities seem to me to 
beeithernon·existent orweJl-
hidden. However, given the 
heavy scientific emphasis at 
this school, this is entirely to 
be expected. 

UCSD has a very sound 
reputation in the sciences, 
particularly in the pre-med 
discipline, and that is the 
very reason most students 
choose this school. It is not to 
be expected that a rookie 
chancellor here at UCSD can 
turn around a whole 
program. Most students here 
are science minded and 
would not touch social 
sciences and humanities if 
they were not forced to by 
graduation requirements. 

Forcing exposure to these 
disciplines only accentuates 
the dislike science-minded 
students have for them and 
might even chas.? away good

know who the president is at 
present . The students here at 
UCSD are ready for an 
administration that they can 
recognize and relate to. That 
is what got the silly party

Third World and women 
should be utilized exten-
sively. The problem in the 
past has been in attracting 
the great number of Qualified 
Third World students to 
actively purs ue beneficial 
objectives in conjunction 
with the A.S. This type of 
effort would definitely yield 
the type of unity and 
experti e neces ary in 
initiating real beneficial 
changes in the student 
interests. To insure this 
effort, the Respect With

Wendell Leonard for Ap-

Chancellor Atkinson is still 

techinically experiencing a 
honeymoon in terms of his 
progress towards improving 
the status of the humanities

approaching the end of his 
first complete year and 
should be evaluated accord· 
intgly. Any negative 
evaluation would certainly 
turn his honeymoon into a 
quick divorce. In the same 
respect , we need a strong A.S. 
to initiate changes and 
s truggle to see them 
implemented. Vice President-
ial candidate Alma Key on the

the Guardian is not utilized 
more effectively as an

Major structural reform is 

needed within the A.S. to 
represent all students more 
fully. Only by making the 
A.S. more representative of 
students - especially Third 
World and women students 
- can we have more 
representative appointments 
to University Committees. 
Currently, many committee 
representatives are not only 
unrepresentative - they fail 
to actively defend student 
interests. The Registration 
Fee Committee is but one 
example of a committee in 
which student representa-
tion has become almost 
meani ngless. Aggress i ve,

Last year. ony 18.5 percent 

of the UCSD budget went to 
instruction-related expenses. 
This is reflective of general 
trends at this University. To 
an ever-increasing extent, 
students are merely the 
window dressing that 
legitimates the University's 
existence - rather than the 
actual focus of its efforts. 
The proposals to institute 
tuition, the spectre of budget 
cut , the university's refu al 
to commit resources to 
education even in the midst 
of increased enrollments; all 
of these stem from the 
university's lack of commit· 
tment to undergraduate 
education. The intensified 
denial of tenure to excellent 
instructor . and the dismal 
retention rate are ymptoms 
of thi . Chancellor Atkinson 
has taken no s teps to remedy 
the situation. Programs such 
as Communications suffer 
under huge s tudent-faculty 
ratios - a problem the 
Univer ity admits, but 
refuses to redress.

There is a massive 

disi llusionment with the

Students have recogni zed 
that the A.S. engages in petty

desperate need for st ructural 
reform - to make the A.S. 
more re pon sive, and 
responsi ble, to students. 
Major issues have slipped by 
the A.S. almost unnoticed -

specific needs, which I will 
review and treat farily. I feel 
this type of system would be 
more efficient as well as 
beneficial to the students 
involved.

ChanceJlor Atkinson has 

attempted constructive 
contact with the students 
throuRh his open forums and 
fireside dinners. While this 
type of approach in itself is 
inadequate, it represents the 
Chancellor's willingness to 
work with the students. The 
A.S.U.C.S.D. is a potentuaJJy 
invaluable mechanism in 
maintaining this rapport 
between student and 
administration. It is 
important that the chancellor 
have confidence in this 
mechanism in order that 
effective changes be made. 
Thus the key to effective 
changes made by the 
chancellor for the students 
depends on the Associated 
Students ability to maintain 
a working Hason both with 
the administration and 
especially with the students.

UC loses affirmative action funds 
BY RICK DOWER 

s.cra.eato eorrelpoeclenl 
Amid criticism that the 

Universit.y of California's 
affirmative action program 
has not increased the number 
of Third World tudents at 
UC, an Assembly panel has 
voted to deny a $1.7 million 
increase for the program next 
year. 

The Ways and Means 
su bcommittee on education 
also turned down the 
University request to fund a 
graduate and professional 
student affirmaUve action 
(SAA) program for $450,000. 

"We re very disappointed," 
said Assistant Vice President 
for Student Services Alice 
Cox, the University's 
systemwide coordinator for . 
Affirmative action . "We 
believe w~ had a good case. 
We need the money for 
support services very badly." 

A report issued by the 
university la st week 
suggested that in lieu of 
greater state s upport for such 
programs, increased tuition 
is a possibility at some 
unspecified point. 

Subcommittee members , 
however, did not buy the 
argument. They complained 
that the university spends 
too much money on its early 
outreach efforts and not 
enough on Third World 
tudents who are already 

enrolled and in danger of 
dropping out. 

Only Gary Hart· (D·Santa 
Barbara) and Peter Chacon 

Legislature questions value of Early Outreach 
(D-Sart D!l!g(», voted to 
sUPPl)rt a $500,000 increase ' 
Hart suggested as .a 
compromise measure. That 
proposal failed 3 to 2. 

Originally, the Board of 
Regents had asked for a 
$629,000 increase for ' 
affirmative action support 
services, including outreach 
into high schools, and $1.1 
million for complete funding 
by the state of UC's SAA 
program. 

At present, tht! state fund 
three quarters of the cost of 

its efforts in early outre~ch to 
hiJdt schools and junior" high 
schools in an attempt to make 
minority students aware 
earlier how to prepare for 
admis ion to UC. 

Because of tho e students, 
"in the pipeline," Cox said, 
the university won't know 
until it evaluates next year's 
entering class how success· 
ful affirmative action has 
really been. 

"I believe our programs ar'e 
working," said Cox. "Next 
year we'll find out if we've

year on 'an experimental 
basis. 

But CPEP analyst Bill 
Pickens said UC ha not

action and recommended the 
money be denied.

the program and the 
university picks up the rest. 
Each year the university asks 
for full state funding but the 
Legislature resists the idea. 

Most of the two hour 
debate at the sub-committee 
hearing centered on the 
questionable defect that the 
affirmative action program 
has had so far in increasing 
the number of minority 
students at the University. 

Legislative analyst Rudy 
Marshall told the panel that 
since 1976, the),ear Ue-began 
affirmative action, the 
number of Black students' 
has dropped from 4.1 percent 
to 3.9 percen t and the num ber 
of Hispanic students has 
remained unchanged . 

Cox said the figures are 
mi leading becau e the 
univer ity ha pent much of 

done a good job." . 
UCSD figures show a 50 

percent increase in early 
applicat!on fi~res, OASIS's 
Ken Majors claims. 

Hart and Chacon seemed 
skeptical. 

"One question we have to 
ask is why should the 

~islature continue to spend 
thIS mQney if it isn't 
achieving what it's supposed 
to," asked Hart, although he 
later voted for the increase. 

Chacon repeatedly asked 
UC officials present at the 
meeting why it isn't possible 
to find out exactly how many 
Third World students are 
now being added by 
affirmative action. 

"You've been doing this for 
five or six years, why have 
there been no results : he

The Education Sub-
Committee also voted to 
recommend $40,000 to 
continue the Systemwide 
Student Affirmative Action 
Advisory Committee, which 
was formed la t year. 

The report of the 
committee, relea sed last ' 
month, called for the 
university to establish goal

The Union of Jewish 
Students will be holding a 
community seder April 19 for 
the second night f Passover in 
the Revelle cafeteria. 

Last year's seder drew 
several hundred people. 

Passover has a very special 
place in Jewish tradition, 
being a holiday of both 
national and religious 

ignificance . Passover 
celebrates the exodus from 
Egypt and the transition of 
the Jews from slaves to a free 
nation . The Seder, the 
traditional meal and 
ceremony, is held to 
commemorate this event and 
to pass from one generation 
to the next the story of the 
Jews' liberation. 

Each generation is 
commanded to consider itself 
as the generation that came 
from Egypt and that all Jews 
were once slaves. The Union 
of Jewish Students is inviting 
all to participate in the Seder 
and to "celebrate the ideal of 
freedom." 

Tickets are available at the 
Student Center Box Office.

'Howling' in pain 
continued from pag(.· 19 The werewolf scenes , 

though overly ~ry , are as 
horrific and terrtfying as any 
screen thriller has ever been, 
but the early non·wolf 
portions are a bit thick with 
metaphor ... people eating 
Wolf Chili, drinking Wolf 
Whiskey, watching wolf 
cartoons, reading wolf books 
and so on. And, of course, 
what would a horror film be 
without the old backlit trees, 
eerie fog and flashlight that 

suddeny conks out. 
While it's slighty jarring to 

see wolfmen wandering 
around in the middle of the 
afternoon, it's reassuring to 
know that a silver bullet still 
works and even more 
reassuring to realize that as 
long a t here are filmakers 
around making movies like 
The Howling, it'll take more 
than a few 'blood 'n sluts' 
massacre films to lay the 
horror genre to rest. 

The Howling with the usual 
werewolf plot, and to reveal 
much more would be to spoil 
some marvelous surprises 
including a couple of 
imaginative twists at the 
end. Director Joe Dante has 
his werewolves (notice the 
pluralization) transforming 
at will , two or three times a 
day paying no heed to the full 
moon or even nighttime. And 
the transformations them-
selves are visually stunning 
scenes, a remarkable 
combination of camera angle, 
animation, inflatable 
dummies and dribbling goo, 
all addi ng up to some 
captivating, chilling mo-
ments . These screen 
werewolves are, for the first 
time in film history, real, 
upright, nine·foot man-
wolves with long. deadly 
c law s, canine s nouts, 
devilish ears and gigantic 
fangs. If Lon Chaney met one 
of these horrors in a midnight 
forest, he wouldn't stand a 
chance. 

Crew team excells 
continued from page 25 
Uptegrove. "I wa happy 
and very impressed at 
their ability to win after 
being so far down early in 
the race." 

The lightweight woo 
men 's eight remains 
undefeated after three 
races, and currently is the 
top lightweight eight on 
the West Coast after 
winning the San Diego 

More on Israel, PLO

Finally. I was surpri ed 
that Mr. Keilani would 
append "Organization of 
Arab Students" to his name. 
The registrar has no record of 
him as a student. We don't 
need outside agitators here at 
UCSD. 
, A second letter, from the 
new indicator, said that it 
does not support Palestinian 
nationalism. Well. the PLO is 
a nationalistic organization. 
Palestinian national unity 
and pan-Arab national unity 
are two of its mottoes. 
Support for the PLO is 
tantamount to support of 
Palestinian nationafic;m 

The third letter writer 
wit held his or her name. and 
obviously did not read my 
letter carefully. Nowhere did 
I mention the Bibl or G·d. 
except to explain why the 
Jews want a homeland. Name 
Witheld claimed that 
America opened her arms to 
all. Well, in 1939 Amelica 
turned away the steamer 51. 
UJl4is. which held over 600 
Jews fleeing the Nazi terror. 
Because America closal her 
door , they were forced to 
return to Europe. and two 
thirds of them later perished 
in the Nazi death camps. If 
Israel had existed then. they 
would have had a "lace togo.

Huge krill bank 
found by Scripps 
Largest discovery in Antarctic 
From the UC News Service 

Osmund Holm·Hansen of 
the Scripps Institution has 
reported the discovery of 
what could be the largest 
school of sea animals ever 
measured - 10 million 
metric tons of shrimp-like 
krill. 

Holm·Hansen, a research 
biologist, is leading a team of 
scientists from the United 
States, Austrialia, Chile, 
Japan. Norway and Sweden 
during the biological phase of 
krill studies off Antarctica. 
This research is part of the 
BIOMASS program, a large 
international study of krill. 

Funding for the UC 
Scripps work is provided by 
the National Science 
Foundation's Division of 
Polar Programs. 

The mass of krill measured 
by the scientists is equal to 
about one seventh of the total 
annual catch of fish from all 
of the world' fresh and salt 
waters - about 70 million 
metric tons. There were 
enough krill in this single 
mass to give each American 
nearly 100 pounds of the 
crustacean. 

T.he swarm of krill was 

measured by acoustical and 
netting techniques during 
three days of a research 
cruise north of a research 
cruise north of Elephant 
Island near the Antarctic 
Peninsula. The researchers, 
who are working aboard UC 
Scripps Institution 's 
research vessel MelvilLe, 
reported the krill patch 
measured several square 
miles and ranged in depth 
from 60 to 600 feet. 

The krill, whose scientific 
name is Euphausia superba, 
is thought by some scientists 
to be a potentially important 
and still largely untapped 
source of 'protem for man 
and animals. Krill is the 
principal food of some whales 
and seals . 

"Dependable data on krill 
populations and their' 
relationship with other life 
in antarctic water will be 
necessary for effective 
resource management ," 
Holm·Hansen said during 

~ hip · ~o'shore telephone 
IOtervlew.

Referendum 
Quations 

Listed belCMI are the referendum questions that 
will dppe,y on your election ballot. Selected 
questions have been prefaced in Ofder to give you 
more complete information concerning the 
issue(s). 

\lI'Ihereas, in Afric", Asia and Latin America CNer 
10 million babies fed on infant formula suffer from 
"bottle baby disease" - dicYrhea, malnutrition, 
brain damage and death - every year; and, 

\lI'Ihereas, in poor countries infant formula can 
cost up to (fJ% of family income thus forcing 
mothers to dilute it and undernourihing the child; 
and, 

Whereas, these families cannot afford 
refrigheration Of sterilization facilities and have to 
use contaminated water rMking the bottle C!nd 
infant fOfmula carriers of disease; and, 

\lI'Ihereas, Nestle employs techniques such as 
advertising in the mass media; supply colourful 
posters and free medical equipment to hospitals; 
offer gifts to doctors to enist their endorsements; 
and employ "milk nurses" - sales people in 
medical uniforms to sell their products to mothers 
in the hospitC!l, to aggressively persuade millions of 
women to stop breast feeding and use formulas; 
and, 

\lI'Ihereas, for CNer eight years nutritioni sts, 
doctors and concerned people have presented 
reports to Nestle showi ng that ttl(ir promotion is 
contributing to a "bottle baby disaster"; and, 

Whereas, despite the mounting criticisms Nestle 
~s made ~ most inconsequential changes in its 
promotion methods; 

Therefore, Be It Resolved, that the ASUCSD 
Council urge all students to Boycott Nestle 
products dispensed th'ough vending machines or

all this through Reg Fees, which are the soe source

abundance, growth , and 
distribution collected durmg 
expeditions such as this one 
is crucial to our understan-
ding of the overall ecology of 
antarctic waters." 

Krill are tiny animals that 
~w no bigger than about2 .5 
Inches and that swim in 
coastal Antarctica and the 
open ocean in vast numbers. 
Rich in protein, it has been 
estimated by some sources 
that krill could be harvested 
at an annual rate of 100 to 150 
million metric tons. But it is 
not known what harvesting 
level could be supported on a 
long-term baSIS without 
overwhelming the ability of 
the marine ecosystem to 
sustain the harvest_ 

The Soviet Union, Japan 
and other countries are 
harvesting krill_ During the 
Mliville's cruise, the 
scientists reported that 35 
Soviet trawlers were present 
in the vicinity of the large 
swarm of krill.

Commentary-
Energy center works 
with Seven Sisters 

From the Ene rgy Cente r 
The Fossil Energy Research Working 

Group, (FERWG) of the Department of 
Energy is currently operating through the 
UCSD Energy Center under a continuation 
grant marking the fourth year of ac t ivity. 

FERWG members are executives of major 
oil companies and scientists and engineers 
from several univers ities. According to 
Stanford S. Penner, Chairman of FERWG 
and Director of the UCSD Energy Center, 
the new studies deal with oil recovery from 
heavy oil deposits and tar sands. 

Previous studies by FERWG were 
performed on coal gasification, coal 
liquefaction and oil recovery from shale. 
FERWG is charged with theresponsibiity of 
evaluating current and future technologies 
for the productin of synthetic fuels to 
replace diminishing oil supplies on US 
markets. 

The FERWG find~ are summarized in 
annual reports describing needed federal 
R&D to aocelerate the production of 
synthetic fuels . 

According to Penner, the production of 
liquid fuels for the transportation sector 

up. 

from al mu t be viewed as a post- l990 
program, with considerable risks and 
anticipated prduct cos ts somewhat above 
current international pr ices (about $45 to 
$55 per barrel). 

Ini tial steps for sha le-oil recovery on a 
significant scale are currently being taken 
by such major companies as Exxon-T osco, 
Mobil , Gulf, Chevron, Occidental-Tenneco, 
Arco and others. Investment costs of about 
two billion dollars will be needed for 
comlnercial plants producing 50,000 barrels 
per day_ 

Total US shale-oil production by 1990 may 
well reach one half million barrels per day. 
The US coal and shale-oil resources are . 
many times larger than the Middle Eastern 
oil reserves and should allow the US to 
become self-suffic ient in liquid fuel 
production by the end of the centu.-y. 

Penner observes that the new FERWG 
studies deal with developed technologies 
that ill contribute importantly to US oil 
supplies within a few years. Heavy oil 
resources in the US re about 10 times larger 
than conventional oil reserves.

Enter Sylvester Stallone 

and Billy Dee Williams, two 
macho, street-wise cops who 
wilh a religious fervor batt le 
the street ~gs of New York 
City, clean 109 the scum off of 
the streets as though their 
police work is equivalent to 
the Department of Sanita-
tion. 

Pan a couple of thous and 
miles away where scum of a 
different strain obliterates a 
department s tore in a fiery 
bomb blas t in the name of 
in ternat ional t erro r ism. 
Devious Wulfgar (Ru tger 
Hauer) stri kes a b low for no 
one in part icular against 
everyone in general for his 
own demented gratification 
as a professional scall ion. 

Stallone and William are 
recrui ted into t he a n ti-
terrorist u pdated version of 
UN C LE h ea dq u arters, 
located , it would appear , in 
the basement of an outhouse. 
T hey quickly become a ntsy 
during t heir indoctrination 
with anti· terrorist techni-
que and are anxiuous to get 
out on the street to pur ue 
the terrorist, suspected now 
of being in New York, and to 
creatively apply their own 
urban gueri lla tactic in 
effecting h i demise. 

T hey hunt him down. 

But he also has a score to 
settle with Stallone, who 
recognized him and threw the 
I)l'overbial monkey-wrench 
'lto his blood soup. 

Stallone is to drive the bus 
w hich will speed the 
terrorists and their captors 
:lway to a waiting airplane. 
Williams' itchy trigger finger 
yuts one terrorist on ice. 
Wulfgar (Hauer) flees undera 

barrage of police rifle fire, 
and ditches the bus in the 
r iver. 

Sta ll on e knows t h at 
Wulfgar did not perish in the 
crash. Through a fantastic 
turn of luck, he locates 
documents in the terror ist's 
h ide-out, some of which 
pertain to Stallone's personal 
life. S uddenly he again knows 
where the fien dish Wulfgar is 
going to strike next. The 
ending i just around the 
corner. 

to the visual impact of the 
film . 

And such impact as is 
made by Nighthawks is, 
undisputably, visual. The 
use of lighting effect s, 
especially the night sequen-
ces, is very, very spiffy. The 
s hot s are intelligently 
planned, and their brevity is 
a testimonial to director 
Bruce McNaimuth's 'keep 
the action moving' technique. 

It is fortunate that the 
lighting use and camera work 
is s u p e r ior, bec au se 
N ighthawks has li ttle else to 
recommend it. The extras are 
a ll c a mer a -co n scio u s. 
Williams, Stallone, Kham-
batta et. a l. are, at best, 
journeymen at their trade. 

Perhaps because the film is 
o devoid of all but a basic 

f ra mewor k of act ion is 
sufficient reason for it to be 
consi dered a h euris t ic 
m aste rpi ece s imi l a r to 
Walter Hill's The Driver. T he 
motivat ions. ideological and 
sociopat h o logica l , a r e 
qu intessentially evi l, and 
require no explanation. The 
cop' per onal lives are 
treated s imilarly. T his is a 
good guys after bad guys 

tory and little or no attempt 
i made to get inside the 
characters' heads, nor is one 
ult imately neces ary to the

Naturally, he is too clever for 
them and escapes. He make 
hi s move lat er , hold ing 
several U.N. delegates as 
host ages. showing no mercy 
as he executes one of them. 

Nighthawks' plot is so 
minimalistic, that the viewer 
is left in sol itude to ascribe 
motiva t io n s, character 
backgrounds, etc. The fast-
paced act ion is typical of any 
killer-thriller, and clearly any 
o th e r t han in ci den ta l

ment is deemed unnecessary 

The film impar ts only 
enough information to the

'Ho\Vling' in pain 
"Even a man who is pure in 

heart and says his prayers by 
night , may become a wolf 
when the wolfbane blooms 
and the moon is full and 
bright." The old gypsy 
woman Maleva spoke that 
classic horror film ver e to 
the accursed Lawrence 
Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) in 
Universal's The Wolfman , 
the first motion picture 
which took the subject of 
lycanthropy with any 
seriousness. 

Since then (back in 1941), 
werewolves have become 
standard staple in the horror 
genre, rearing their ugly 
heads in sequel after sequel 
after remake, always 
rehashing the same old 
'silver bullet through the 
heart' plot and Chaney·type 
camera-dissolve wolf 
transformations and make· 
up. And no.J/; just when you 
thought the horror film had 
been killed by the recen t gus h 

of bloody·slush exploitation 
films, here comes The 
Howling which restores the 
werewolf to his former 
glories and depicts him as a 
creat ure more terrifying than 
ever. 

For the first hour, The 
Howling is a big di appoint-
ment. The plot seems unsure 
of itself, you never actually 
see any werewolf and it's 
hard to say who was a 
werewolf, who is a werewolf 
and who might become a 
werewolf. 

We begin with what seems 
like the middJe by tracking 
ace television news anchor-
woman Karen White as he 
singlehandedly tries to 
capture a psychotic murderer 
who rips out the throats of 
his victims. They meet in a 
porno shop movie booth 
where the killer is killed 
himself in a hail of police 
bullets, or 'is he? The 
experience is so traumatic 

(she things she saw the 
psycho 'change' into 
something) that her friend, 
Dr. George Waggner (patrick 
MacN ee of The Avengers TV 
fame) uggests she rest on his 
isolated farm which 
conveniently also plays host 
to an assorted batch of 
supposed nut ca e . 

Things perk up at the 
farm, especially since it is 
populated by great character 
actor s s u c h as John 
Carradine (who twice 
portrayed Dracula) and Slim 
Picken along with a 
sensually evil raven·haired 
woman and her strange buck-
toothed brother. Finally, it 
seems that the psychotic 
killer, actually a werewolf, is 
not dead and has followed 
Karen to t he farm to complete 
his murderous plans, but 
things are not always as they 
seem.

Records/Ted Burke 
Santana rebops with 'Zebop' 

ZebofJ! - Santana (Colum-
bia~ 

I ve listened to this record 
about three times now and, to 
drop for the time the cynic' 
guise, I enjoy it. Far from 
being a breakthrough into 
new areas for the Santana 
band, Zebop is rather a 
rehash of the band doing 
what they've always done, 
and doing it very well. 

For the record, Zebop is a 
virtual re-run of their past 
moves: "Tales of Kilmanja-
ro" is a rambling, two chord 
instrumental from the 
Caravansara days spotlight-
ing the ever nimble-fingered 
Carlos displaying his 
characteristically fragmen-
ted ~itar soloing. "The 
SenSItive Kind," written by 
JJ. Cale and featuring a 
searing vocal by Alex 

Litertwood, replays the 
samba-rock motif of "Evil 
Woman" and "Stormy." "I 
Love You Much Too Much," 
anot·her instrumental, 
hearkens back to Carlos' 
early tusion experiments 
with John Mclaughlin, with 
riff exchanges between 
Santana and keyboard ist 
Richard Baker that remind 
one of Beck and Hammer on 
"Blue Wind," only with a 
more equitable distribution 
of improvi ational dutie . In 
general. tho e who've 
preferred Carlo' Santana ' 
commercial efforts over his 
jazz oriented solo work will 
find much to recommend 
Zebop. 

Still, the recorddoeshavea 
predictibility that is fairly 
annoying for anyone who

Two chords are better than one because Carlos is brilliantly OK. 

How to tell the difference 
in the dark. 

Is lince this is a . 
college newspaper, 
this is an educational 
ad. About dark beer. 
Or more specifically, about 
the two ways to make 
beer dark. 

San Miguel 

M ethod # 1: Add caramel coloring. 
M ethod #2: Gather the best barley malt 

obtainable. Slowly deep.roast it, taking care not 
to scorch or char it. Add pure brewing water and 
work the mash at appropriate temperatures for 
several hours, stirring constantly. Filter out the 
spent grain . Add a pinch of your best hops 10 
resultant dark wort while boiling, then pump to 
settling tank and add pure brewer's yeast. cultured 
from your own special strain. Ferment for 7-10 
days, recovering resultant natural carbonation for 
re-carbonation just prior to bouling. Transfer dark 
beer to storage cellars for maturation and aging. 
Age for several weeks at approximately OOC, then 
filter. Transfer bright dark beer to bottles. Cap 
tightly and pasteurize to protect quality. Chill 
and enjoy. 

I w I hile Method # 1 may be a convenient 
shortcut, we prefer Method #2 be-

cause we believe it results in a better dark 
beer. We think you will too, now that you know 

the difference. If 
, you'd like to find 
out who's been using 

Method # 1, here's what 
to look for. Real dark 

Brand X beer is really dark. Not just 
sort of dark. True roasted 

barley malt substantially darkens the entire 
beer. Including the head. Caramel coloring, 
on the other hand, doesn't sit as well at 
the top. So when beer has been darkened by 
simply adding caramel coloring, its head 
doe n't show as much color. If you want 
further proof, have someone turn off the 
lights. You can smell and taste the difference 
in real dark - in its deep-roasted aroma and 
flavor, and in its smooth, rich , creamy body. 

INlow that you know how beers are 
made dark. we think you 'n prefer a 

real dark beer. We've been making ours 
since 1890. We call it 
San Miguel.

Thunday April 16.1981 The Guardian 

Film/Lynette Tom 

Starr flick caves in 
I've always found Dar-

win's theory of evolution a 
mite hard to swallow. 
Watching Caveman has 
confirmed my doubts. 

The film is an allegedly 
humorous account of pre-
historic man's achievements 
(his rise to an erect position, 
discovery of fire, making of 

- tools, domestication of 
animals, etc.), as perpetrated 
by an unassuming chap 
named Atouk. What makes 

Caveman such a dull comedy 
is that it strives toward the 
satirical jab of Monty 
Python, but settles for the 

la~klustcr inanity . of Benny -
Hill. The combmed live 
action and animation scenes 
are a pale shadow of Terry 
Gilliam's colorful work. The 
musical alJusions to 10 and 
2001: A Space Odyssey can be 
seen (or rather, heard) from a 
proverbial mile away. The 
characters are constantly 

Meet" your new neighbors 

subjected to such lowbrow 
atrocities as having huge 
dragonflies squashed in their 
faces, receiving unintention-
al tar baths, and rolling 
around in a mountain of 
dinosaur dung, all for the 
sake of a cheap laugh. 

Another thing about 
Caveman that's bothersome 
is its overal1 look. If I didn't 
know better, I would 've 
sworn that I was watching an 
episode of Gilligan's Island . . 

The film's got the same style 
of tacky titles and the same 
orchestration of muzak. The 
settings are typical of the 
backdrops from some 
Hollywood back lot , despite 
the fact they're actual 
locations (Durango and 
Puerto Vallarta. Mexico). 
Even the main characters 
take on a resemblance to the 
castaways, what with Atouk 
as a convincingly bearded 
and bumbling Gilligan, 

·Tonda as the rambunctious 
Skipper, Lana as the ever-
alluring Ginger, and Tala as 
the sweet and good·natured 
Mary Ann. 

The special effects aren't 
special at all. In fact, they're' 
pretty bad. The prehistoric 
creatures are a cross between 
the monsters in a Saturday 
morning Japanese puppet 
cartoon and the reject ]Jile of 
animals from The EmI';r~ 

21 

SIn. Bac •. The characters 
emit a blu~ aura where the 
optical printer failed to 
produce a clean matte shot. 
The props aren't that much 
better, having the quality ofa 
plastic bauble found at a 
souvenir shop at Universal 
Studios. 

As for the acting, Ca,l""",,, 
represents the profession at 
its very lowest. RiOlO Starr 
(Atouk), John Matuzak 

~Onda), Barbara Bach .), Shelley Long p'aIII), nis Quaid (Atou~. ..I, 
Lar), Jack Gilford (Tala's 
blind father, Gog), and Avery 
Schreiber (Tonda's hench-
man, Ock) ought to be 
ashamed of themselves for 
taking roles that resort them 
to luntbering II'OUnd and 
making guttural noises.

likes a band to make some 
hanges in its' sound and the 

effect is like watching a Slor 
Trd episode for: the 
umpteenth time. Nice moves, 
but what else is new? One 
song, "Winning"attheendof 
side one, does break the 
Santana format. Penned by 
Russ Ballard (formerly of 
Argent), the melody, buoyed 
by sparkling keyboard work 
by Alan Pasqua, is bright and 
appealing, backed by a firm 
backbeat, somewhat reminis-

- cent of the high tech popoflO 
CC and ELO. 

My favorite Santana cuts 
over the last five years ave 
been when they've covered 
other people's soNts, as when 
they did Traffics' Dealer" or 
Buddy Holly's "Well 
Alright," and I think they 
coo Id do a lot worse than to go 

in~o this direction. At any 
rate, Zebop for the most part 
is a clone of what they've 
done before, albeit an 
inspired one. B·plu8.

Point 0/ Entry - Judas Priest 
(Columbia) 

There's nothing particu-" 
larly original on these two 
records, a fact that's hardly 
surprising since bands in the 
heavy-metal genre long ago 
used up their quotient of 
bright ideas, I've always been 
a sucker for the stuff though , 
and , being one who till 
discriminate as to the kind 
of power-chord abu e I'll 
deafen my elf with, I think 
an argument can be made a 
to why one record is better ' 
than the other . The 
distinctio]ls, though, are 
faint, or should I ay , vague, 

Of the two, The Blizzard 0/ 
.ozz by former Black Sabbath 
. singer Ouy Osbourne is 
easily the more likable.

Women's netters 
take third place 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Staff Wriler 

The UCSD's women's 
tennis team hosted the 
annual All-Call Tournament 
last weekend and pulled out a 
third place fini~ out of the 
five tealll field, (UCLA and 
Santa Barbara were unable 
to parti c ipate due to 
scheduling conflict ). 

Division I entrant UC 
Irvine dominated the round-
robin tournament with an 
unblemished 4-0 record. Uel 
gave up only two matche 
over the cou rse of the 
weekend, both to econd 
place fini her UC Davis, en 
route to their fir t place 
finish. Davis' 3-1 tournament 
record was sufficient to 
secure second place. 

The Tritons fini hed third 
(as expected by coach Liz 
Dudash) with a 2-2 record, 
droPfing one to Davi 8-1 and 
to rvine 9-0, Cecilia 
Kavinaugh, UCSD 's number 
one seed, provided the lone 

tally in the win column for 
the Tritons in th ir match 
wit h Davis. The Tritons beat 
both Santa Cruz 8-1 and 
Riverside 5-4. UC Riverside 
fin ished out the tournament 
in fourth pIa e with a 1-3 
record and anta Cruz 
brought up the rear, posting 
an over-all 0-4 record , 

UCSD coach Duda h felt 
they hould have beaten 
Riverside by a wider margin 
than the narrow 5-4, but that 
match was the last of four 
over the weekend and the 
Tritons were all feeling the 
effects of the amount of 
tennis they had played. 

The high pint of the 
tournament for the Tritons 
was Kavinaugh 's surprisi ng 
6-4, 6-4 defeat of her UC 
Davis opponent. All of the 
matche. were fairly one-
sided, yet they stiJI provided 
good compet ition for all of the 
participants, even Irvine.

Strikers are winners 
1M softball sports 262 teams 

Brian SimiIlOll (I) aoes up for ball with teammate Greg 
Scarcello in recent 1M aoftb8IJ lame. The SUder Inllidehers 
beat the Hie Sticks, 11-10, in AA divisioo play. 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
sparta EdiIDr 

Intramural softball had its 
annual debut last Monday, 
and the 1M game of the week 
featured the hard hitting 
Slider Insidehers paired with 
the aggressive play of the Big 
Sticks. 

Both teams capitalized on 
their opponents first inning 
uneasiness and terri ble 
fielding, with the Sticks 
takin~ an early 7·4 lead. 

NeIther squad could 
muster any offense until the 
fifth inning, when the Sliders 
put on an incredible rally. 
Before the inning was over 
the Big Sticks were left with 
the remains of a five run 
burst, and the Slider 
Insidehers took the lead for 
good. 

After six innings the game , 
was called due to time, and an 
elated Slider Insid~her team 
had earned its first win , 11-
10. 

Slider Insideher pitcher 
Jerry Davis called the win "a 
great way to start the 
season," and then ran off the 
field to grab a victory brew. 
The remaining eight Sliders, 
as could be expected, followed 
their pitcher to the watering 
hole.

Men's AA division were as

The UCSD crew team 
continued its winning 
ways last weekend with 
trong performances at 

races in Marina del Rey 
and Redwood Shores. 

The Men's lightweight 
team trave\1 d from the 
Bay Area to Redwood 
Shores to race twice. In 
their first race the crew 
defeated the Lake Merrit 
Rowing Club and Hum-
boldt College by a wide 
margin. On Sunday, 
rowing against Santa 
Clara College in a 2000 
meter race, UCSD lost by 
1.5 seconds. The light· 
weights had Ut!aten Sant 
Clara last weekend in the 
San Diego Crew Classic. 

The heavyweight men 
and all of t he women's 
boats also travelled last 
weekend to Marina del 
Rey , where the home 
course of UCLA and 
Loyola is located. 

The lightweight wo-
men's eight had the most 
impressive comeback of 
the day. Racing again t 
the Loyola openweight 
boat, they were behind by 
seven seats after 250 
meters of the 1000 meter 
race. The Tritons finished 
strongly though, to win 
the race by three seats, a 
substantial margin. 

Their performance 
pleased coxswain Lori

Cyclists do well at Dominguez Hills 
The UCSD cycling team 

overcame a number of 
obstacles to take first place in 
a day of racing put on by the 
Claremont Colleges on 
Saturday. However, on 
Sunday the Tritons were 
unable to match a strong UC 
Santa Barbara team and 
placed second in the 
Southern California Intercol-
legiate Championships held 
at CSU Dominguez Hills. 

Saturday'S race was held 
on a perfectly flat 1.3 mile 
course which circled Live 
Oak Reservoir near Clare-
mont. The best effort of the 
day was by Tim Rodden, who 

came in econd ' place out of 
sixty riders in the 20 mile 
novice race. Rodden also 
helped the team by scoring 
points in both sprints held 
twice during the course of the 
race. 

In the women's race, Vicky 
Somers rode a very strong 
race, finishing third out of 
fifteen riders in the 13.3 mile 
race. Also scoring points for 
the team were Nancy Dienes 
and Colleen Kenney, coming 
in fifth and sixth place. 

In the 28 mile expert race, 
George Grigoriev placed 
highest among the San Diego 
riders, coming in sixth in a 

field of fifteen riders. 
In the overall standings, 

UCSD finished first with 61 
points, followed closely by 
Santa Barbara with 59 
points . Over ten teams from 
throughout California 
competed. 

Their victory was even 
more remarkable considering 
that many of the San Diego 
riders did not fini h due to 
crashes. In the last lap of the 
novice race, a rider near the 
front of the pack fell, bringing 
down 14 riders behind him , 
including six San Diego 
riders, and sending one San 
Diego rider to the emergency 

room with a shoulder injury.

~ould not overcome UCSB's 
!xcellent team tactics and 
la rger team. coming in 
;;econd place with 97.5 points 
to UCSB's 173.5 

High point of the day again . 
was novice Tim Rodden, who 
finished in first place in the 
15 mile novice race. 
Establishing a 2-man 
breakaway midway in the 
race, Rodden easily out-
sprinted his opponent from 
Mt. Sac in the final 
straightaway. Also scoring 

points in the novice race were 
Eric Kennedy and Greg 
Schermann, who were part of 
the eight· man pack which 
broke away from the sixty 
man field early in the race. 

Mark Gerber put in a very 
strong late effort to place 
third in the 30 mile expert 
race, behind two UCSB 
riders . Santa Barbara 
overwhelmed the other 
teams in this race, having six 
riders in the breakaway 
group of ten, protecting the 
one UCSB rider off the front . 
UCSD student-coach Paul 
Vine placed ninth in the 
expert race.

continued from pal(e 5 
newspapers - new mdicator, 
Voz Fronteriza, and L 'Cha· 
yim is that they present 
students with information 
that they don't receive in the 
Guardian. However, I think 
at times the new indicator has 
been nothing more than a 
"UCSD National Enquirer." 
I think it would be beneficial 
to students if they dealt with 
campus issues a little more 
ckarly - maybe? 

#5 
Two methods of insuring 

Third World and women 
representatives on campus-
Wide committees should be to 
make sure that the commit-
tee that appoint representa-
tives are ethnically and 
sexually balanced; and for 
the AS to have more 
communication with the 
SAAC organizations. This 
should be implemented 
through advertisement in the 
alternative newspapers, such 
as Voz Fronleriza and PeoPle's 
Voice, as well as special 
memos sent to each of the 
ethnic organizations on 
campus. I feel that the AS and 
SAAC need to work on shared 
goals together, and more 
communication between the 
two is extremely important. 
Working towards these two 
goals would also be positive 
steps in ensuring continued 
representation in the budget 
process a well. 

#6 
I feel that the chancellor's 

forums that are held weekly 
in the Student Center have 
been very positive and are 
commendable on his part. 

However , with his 
continued emphasis that 
UCSD is primarily and most 
importantly a research 
institution, and now with his 
plans to institute a School of 
Engineering, I can't help but 
feel that he is not paying 
enough attention to the 
humanities and social 
science. 

The chancellor has to 
realize that undergraduate 
students want excellence in 
teaching, and that not every 
student is interested in math 
and science. 

If he i going to become 
committed towards improv-
ing the humanitie and social 
sciences then he should be 
more open to keepi ng 
programs like Urban and 
Rural Studies and Third 
World Studies. He should 
also be working towards 
maki ng the excellent 
communications program we 
have here into a department. 

#7 
I feel that the reason the 

Silly Slate did so well la .. t 
year, because their humorous 
approach to campaigning 
was so refreshing. I think 
students needed a break from 
the grind and pressures of 
coll~ life, and the Silly Slate 
prOVided them with that. 
Another contributing factor 
to their success, was the one-
on-one contact that the slate 

had with students out on 
Revelle Plaza - they were 
immediately recognizable 
with their balloons and party 
hats. I think the election of 
the slate showed the need for 
students to identify with the 
AS, because in the past. the 
student government hac 
been so bureaucratic. I think 
it also reflected feelings that 
st udents had towards 
government as a whole. Once 
the slate got into office, 
however, they realized that it 
takes a lot of work for 
someone who is inexperien-
ced to do a good job, and they 
wanted to do a good job. 

#8 
I am not in favor of funding 

more TGIF's than wealready 
have. The TG's serve a 
definite benefit of being able 
to unwind and get blitzed 
every now and then, but I 
think that there are many 
more programs that the 
entire UCSD student 
population could benefit 
from _ As it stands now 
everyone pays an activity fee 
and when a good portion of all 
the programming done on 
campus can only be enjoyed 
by those over 21 then th is is a 
problem that I think needs to 
be resolved. 

One resolution to this 
problem may be to have 
alternative social programs 
whether they be dances, 
movies, ourdoor recreational 
activities, whatever - just 
something where everyone 
can have fun. Yeah! 

Adams 
continued (rom page 6 
proven that they are unhappy 
with the present structure of 
the A.S_ I think it is time that 
we bring students back into 
the operation of the A.S_, to 
become an active part of the 
system. For in essence, that 
is exactly what Associated 
Students is all about. 

#8 
A.S. sponsored T.G.I.F.'s 

are one of the best 
expenditures that the A.S. 
makes. Most all of A.S. 
programming is good , and 
serves a large section of the 
population _ I am completely 
in favor of TG's and would 
like to see more. I would also 
like to see more A.S . 

rrogramming in other area . feel that the under-21 crowd 
at TG's is adequately served. 
I am 20 years old and have 
enjoyed TG's. 

Thursday April 16.1981 

Bagneris 
continued from page 6 
student perceptions of the 
A.S. are concerned, most 
students u se four -letter 
words to describe its 
ineffectiveness in dealing 
with real student concerns. If 
the silly slate taught us 
anything last year, it was 
that this year we can not 
afford another s illy s late nor 
ineffective leadership. 

#8 
I think TGIF's could better 

serve the student population 
through diversified program-
ming. That is, programming 
that reflects the different 
tastes of music in the student 
population. TGIF's do not 
have to be boring social afairs 
where beer is the major 
excitement activator. They 
should be fun and enjoyable 
to attend. The under 21 
populations' needs definitely 
are not served by the present 
programming provided this 
year. Those who desire a 
brew or two before they can 
do the do, should utilize 
Walk's place whre they can 
find excellent music and be 
able to drink beer at their 
own and not the A.S.'s 
ex pen e. Commissioner of 
Programming candidate 
Audrey Hearn wi ll bring back 
the real meaning of TGIF.

I support the ocntinued 

appropriation of A.S , funds to 
T .G.I.F.'s at the present rate. 
They provide a valuable on-
campus service. They are 
cost-efficient and socially 
worthwhile. They not ony 
serve free alcohol to those 
over 21. but provide an 
atmosphere conducive to 
meeting others. The 
atmosphere, along with the 
free entertainment, are 
especially beneficial to dor", 
residents and underclass-
men . T .G.I .F.'s also provide 
non-alcoholic beverages li~ 
milk and juice a well a free 
food such a cookies and 
popcorn .

As the A.S. Commis ioner 

of Programming I have been 
responsi~le for this years 
T .G.I.F. s_ Although stu-
dents seem to enjoy the A.S . 
Programming's T .G.'s, we 
feel that 3 to 4 T.G.'s per 
quarter is quite adequate. 
The que 'tion here is not 
whether to have more 

27 

T.G.I.F.'s, but whether to 
have higher quality T.G.'s 
(i.e, high quality bands). 
Adam Fore t, the Student 
Slate 's candidate for 
Commi sioner of Program-
ming. ha worked with the 
University Event Office for 
the past three years; we feel 
that his knowledge of the 
music industry combined 
with hi s other U.E.O . 
experience will contribute to 
the continued high quali ty of 
T.G.' . 

If poll taken at previou 
T.G. 's are a ny indication, th 
students hav been well 

atisfied with the refresh-
ment ituation. However. at 
the next T .G. [ intend to poll 
specifica ll y the under-21 
segment of tudent in 
attendance, and if dissatis· 
faction is expressed I will 
place increased emphasis on 
alternate refreshments , 

Bekken 
continued from page 6 
has ignored the parking 
s ituation - parking fees are 
too high , and they are going 
up; student are treated as 
third-class citizens in access 
to parking s paces. The A.S_ 
ha not fought for Student 
int rests; rather. the have 
let the Bureaucracy prevail. 
Student view the A.S. a 

illy because it ha no power 
over the real problems that 
confront tudents. We mu t 
change thi . , and the Immoral 
Minori ty late, working with 
other people who will be 
elected, can do it.

T.G.I.F.'s are a pleasant 

relief for many students, and 
serve a valuable purpose. The 
under·21 tudent population 
(a vely large segment of the 
undergraduate student body) 
does not, however, benefit 
from these events_ Ways of
