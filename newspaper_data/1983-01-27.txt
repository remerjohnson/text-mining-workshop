A new look ...

News Editor 
Under the towering ceilings 

of the Hotel Del Coronado's 
Crystal Continental Room 
(once the site of a meeting 
bet ween then·president 
Richard Nixon and the 
pres ident of Mexico),John S.R. 
Shad spoke last Friday at a 
luncheon sponsored by UCSD 
Extension's Securities 
Regulation Inst itute. 

Shad, chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), discussed 
the commissions's recent 
performance and briefly 
touched on the increasingly 
complex interplay of financial 
services offered by banks, 
S&Ls, thrifts and brokerage 
houses. 

A bizarre sidelight to his 
speech was the filming of the 
TV series Hart to Hart in the 
hotel's lobby. The series' 
stars, Robert Wagner and 
Stephanie Powers, each spoke 
briefly to the audience, which 
was primarily of lawyers 
specializing in securities. 
After an awkward "hello, 
hello" from Wagner, Powers 
made a plea for contributions 
to a group she represents 
dedicated to the preservation 
of wildlife in Africa. 

Once the ball got rolling 
again, Shad poured forth a 
staggering list of facts and 
figures in a dull monotone that 
stood in sharp contrast to the 
brilliance of his personal 
accomplishments. A graduate 
of USC, Harvard Business 
School, and New York 
University's law school, Shad 
has sat on a total of 17 boards 
of directors, having had to b t 
resign f.rom no .less than seven U 
upon hiS appomtment to the 
SEC. 

the same old bird 
Shad 's success in business 

has been carried over into the 
SEC s ince his appointment. In 
the face of a five percent 
cutback in per onnel, the SEC 
brought about las t year a 30 
percent increase in enforce· 
ment case, a 25 percent 
increase in investment 
company inspections and a 25 
percent gain in full ·di closure 
filings. 

In fi cal 1982, 94 percent of 
the SEC's $83 million budget 
was offset by registration and 
other fees, a opposed to 81 
percent in 1981. Shad 
attributed the gain in 
efficie ncy to newly instit uted 
computer formats such as 
CATS (Case Analysis and 
Tracking System), which 
gives a weekly follow·up and 
review of enforcement. The 
higher budget offset was a 
result of increased revenues 
from Money Market funds . 

In the area of regulation, the 
"pendulum ha s swu ng ," 
according to Shad. With new 
rules allowing banks to offer 
sec ured funds at money 
market rates, he feels it's only 

a matter of time before 
brokerage firms are allowed to 
offer more banking services to 
customers . He did not 
speculate on how this might 
affect consumers, already 
baffled by · the increas ing 
variety of financial service ,as 
well as the multitude of 
different indus tries offering 
them. 

The commission ha s 
garnered a lot of attention 
lately as it s teps up efforts to 
prevent brokers from trading 
on ins ide information . had 
confirmed that his people have 
made this a priority, but said 
that enforcement cases 
dealing speci ficall y with this 
problem wtill make up only 
about eight percent of the 
SEC's total. 

All is not wine and roses in 
the finance industry. however, 
as thorn y problems have 
a risen bot h in terms of 
regulation a nd the cur rent 
economic depression . Ameri · 
can banks, long infamous for 
their international mischief. 
have made some dangerous 

fi scal and legal blunders in 
recent years, raising questions 
in and out of government 
about their ability to act in a 
respon ible and financially 
sound manner. "Banking" and 
"logic" seem to have become 
mutually exch.i ive terms. 

In the area of fina nce, the 
evidence is already in. In the 
1970s, American banks made 
billions of dollars in loans to 
developing nations on the 
strength of those countrie ' 
projected oil export revenues 
(see the Guardian 1·20·83). 
With the worldwide oil glut 
and the inability of OPEC to 
stabili ze pnces, the price of 
crude has plummeted . Wh ile 
this will please customers at 
the gas pumps, the decline in 
profits to producers rai , es the 
spectre of these goverments 
defaulting on their loans, an 
action that cou ld nu h banks 
right down the toilet. 

In the area of law, hard facts 
are difficullt to pin down.John 
Fedders. the SEC\ nc\\ 
Reagan·appointed Enforce· 
m nt Division head, was 
quoted m a recent Forlune 

maga zll1e article. In a 
confidential memo, he wrote, 
" I do not sub cribe to the 
theory that a company that 
violate' tax and exchange 
control regulation i a bad 
corporation, and that the 
disclosure of legal conduct 

hould be forced as a 
prophylactic measu re." 

In that same article David 
Edward', a former Citibank 
executive working in Pari, 
outlined activities hiS 
employ r engaged in dunng 
his tenure . Edwards claim.., 
that Citibank, a subsldlarv of 
Citicorp, regularly engaged m 
a pract ice known as "parkmg" 
in order to avoid paying taxes 
in countries that had 
particularly high corporate 
taxes. 

"Parking" IS a term that 
refers to a pnx'ess of profil 
transfer t hat works somet hmg 
like thiS: bank's Zunch 
office \vill "ell ,'WISS currenn 
to its s ister branch 111. sa\', 
Nassau, usually after regular 

bllsmes~ hou rs . The ne, t da v, 
Zunch will buy the curr('nc~ 
back at a slightly hlghcr rate 

ing profits under the table and 
keeping the ledgers In a neat. 
profit and loss context. 

Citibank even went so far as 
to keep two sets of books, one 
to show government auditors. 
and the other (known as the 
MPR, or Management Profit 
Report) for use in·house to get 
an accurate representatIOn of 
which branches were actuallv 
pulhng a profit. -

Edwards, after futile effort 
to alert top· level management 
and institute a return to above 
board operations. compiled a 
packet of memos, letters and 
other eVidence of infractIOn 
and pre ented it to the SEC. 
~ Nothing happened. 

Thomas von Stein, an SEC 
lawyer who had worked on the 
commis ion's case agamst 
Robert Vesco, took on the 
Citibank case and found 
evidence of parking, as well as 
numerous other violations. On 
the basis of this evidence, the 
Enforcement Division felt that 
it had grou nds to ta ke 
Citibank to court for failing to 
di close information to 
stockholders. Fedders , 
however, killed that action, 
stating that since Citibank 
had not told stockholder that 
its senior management 
possessed .. hones t y or 
integrity," it wa not bound to 
disclose unlawful actions. 

Citibank did not fare as well 
overseas, where the French 
and Swiss governments have 
levied demands for millions of 
dollars in back taxes lost as a 
result of parking. 

From behind the oak and 
brass podium at the Hotel Del. 
John S.R. Shad agelyavoided 
mention of the Citibank 
incident and his commis IOn's 
decision to relax di clo ure 
laws to that bank' benefit. In

We need not di scuss the fir, t

the second , the UC D Police, 
thi s group mu s t take 
responsibility for keeping all 
motorized vehicles off the 
pathway, especially during the 
midday's every·hour on·the-
hour "rush hours." The UC 
employees who ride around in 
their Iiltle white pickups can 
u e other ways to get from 
Third to Revelle to Warren to 
wherever. a nd for most 
situations these routes are 
quite adequate. Also, although 
ordinances exisl to keep 
moped s and even motor-
cycli ' ts off the Main Drag, at 
times the se aren't well 
enforced. 

Next, let' s hear it for the 
planners of our pathways. 
With ou t t he foresight to 
attempt to duplicate the 
successful bicycle pathway 
svstem of our sister campus in 
:allta Barbara. UCSD's 

campus planners came up 
with a prinCiple pathway

The Bird, the legend, 
to be er-ected today 
By ROBERT "Don't Call 

Me Bob" LEONE 
The much·faulted, long-

awaited Sun God by Niki de 
Saint Phalle will be arriving at 
this campus soon. It will be 
officially bolted onto its pillar 
or arch of stLlccoed concrete at 
3 pm today, and the whole 
campus, student body. and 
prettv much anyone who 
doesn't have to be someplace 
else is, or are cordially invited 
to attend . 

That IS all I really know for a 
fact. except that the Bird will 
not co t the students a cent, 
and that the Bird cost a lot 
less, an incredible lot less, to be 
specific, than the purple giant 
volleyball net set out by Robert 
Irwin . 

But , there are legends about 
the Bird , legends that only 
now can be recited with a fair 
amount of distortion, 
baselessness and downright 
fabrication , 

The Bird was originally 
purchased by John Delorean 
and was scheduled to be 
shipped to Miami, then to 
Arizona. John visited the Bird 
once in the workshop that was 
building it. The day before, he 
had pu rcha ed 10,250 gross of 
plastic zip-top bag , about the 
size the cops use to preserve 
scraps of hair and other such 
evidence. That night, the price 
of cocaine in Paris rose about 
200 francs an ounce. 

Then, well, you don 't have 
to be an econ. major to figure 
that one out. 

The Bird was originally sold 
to Mexico City as a 
representation of some Aztec 
god. One fears that , 3,000 
' years from now, the Bird will 
be ci ted as evidence of 
sacrificial rites among faculty 
and administration at UCSD. 

If the Bird goes up, the 
Soviets, knowing that Reagan, 
who has taken no mercy on 
college s tudents for being 
young and occasionally vot ing 
for liberal Democrats, and who 
is therefore totally depraved 
and can not be reasoned with, 
will launch nuke citing the 
Bird as an excuse. 

The Bird is actually a 
satellite warfare station. Anv 
Hussian spy sate llite that 
SP()t~ it will suffer a lota l 
brea kdown of a II opt Ical 
"yslem".

bird if it goes up. 
A cheeseburger from the 

Rat keller has to be sacrificed 
to the Bird every academic 
quarter or it will come to life 
and eat all the Muir res ident 
students, 

The Bird marks a buried 
treasure: 57 unpublished and 
unrecorded Beatles songs, 
including "Don't Take My 
Fantasies Away." 

Lastly. the Bird is not a bird 
at all. It isn't there, you're just 
imagining things, I'll take you 
to some nice men in white 
suits and they'll put you in this 
jacket with long arms and 
they'll take you away to a nice 
place where you can get some 
rest." 

So much for legend s. 
Onward to opinions. 

They shouldn't put theBird 
on the arch. The arch alone 
has more emotional and 
artistic content than the 
purple voleyball net. The 
should make a second arch, or 
just a straight pillar for the 
Bird near Revelle or Warren. 
The pillar looks like the 
world's largest free-standing 
guano deposit. 

So, of course they put the 
world's largest guano 
producer on top. If the work is 
by a modern artist , why is the 
a rch some sort of neo · 
Romantic thing with a ruined 
temple feeling? 

Is the Bird really there to 
offset the UC Gothic style of 
Muir buildings? Where are the 
huge busts of Earl Warren, 
John Muir and Roger Revelle? 
So you don 't like it? So it looks 
silly? Look, that's what they 
thought about Picasso. It does 
add a nice spot of color, but 
maybe a bed of African violets 
would have been better. 

Finally, all r have to say is 
that it's going UP, and there is 
no rea on why I ShOU ld worry 
about it. At worst, it'll make 
the Guardian 's letters·to-the-
editor much more interesting 
for a few weeks. 

Information for thi s article 
was provided by Gerry 
McAllister, Clydene Nee. my 
sis ter Cathy (who prO\' ided the 
idea that the Bird is there to 
offset the Muir bulldmgs), the 
wastebaskets of I he St uart 
CollectIOn (which pays fo r the 
sculptures. by the v. ay), and

Letters to the Editor 

Muir representative speaks out 
Editor: 

As a Muir College Council 
me mber who responded 
hones tl y to questions asked by 
The Guardian for an article 
appearing in the January 17 
issue, I was dismayed 10 see 
Steven Friedman's January 24 
letter to the editor defend ing 
the Muir College Council's 
legitimacy and attacking me. 
Thi s attack , beyond being 
personal in nature, only 
illustrates the parochial view 
of student government and 
admini tration s hared by 
some of my colleagues on the 
council. This view can only be 
described as "collegism," a 
phenomenon particular to 
UCSD and its four college 
system. "Collegism" is a sort 
of nationalism towards one's 

Oliphant 

college akin ro high school 
football rivalries, and it is 
most prevalent among college 
cou nci lmembers and their AS 
representatives. 

The logic of structuring 
student government on the 
basis of college looks fine on 
the su riace due 10 our 
Ameri can tradition uf 
geographical representation , 
but it is in the underlying 
pre s umption that Muir 
st udents are in need of a 
certain Iype of representation 
and are set apart from ot her 
students that the logic breaks 
down . Geographical repre· 
sentation in the university 
sett ing oon become solely 
representative of on·campus 
student interests, no matter 
how many overtures are made

To enforce the Mexican border and stamp out communism 
Editor: 

We have a few people out of

projects thelt would not only 
furni"h work. but would IX-

track of just \\'ho is coming to 
our country. and just what 
"ome of our pcople are doing. 
especially If their acti\'lIles 

consi~t of doing somet hing 
that is against the law. 

We could put some of our 
cit izens to work building a 
better nel work of fences along 

our Mexican horder or better 
still. why not build a canal 
a long ou r sou t h ern Ixlrder 
from Texas to California. We 
need :-oome war for 'iupet" 
tankers and air 'craft carners 
to carry "upplie:-o from theEast 
Coast to lhe \\ e"t Coast. 'uch 
a canal could la:-t thuusand" of 
years. and besides being a 
means 01 transportation . il 
could be a source of \1 aiel 
supply for a clry area a~ \\ ell as 
providing recreational 
facilities for thousands of 
people. We have many people 
now stationed in Europe who 
could return home to lI.:ork on 
such a project. Thi" would 
stop the drain on t hp dollar

the nuclear arllls ract'. 

The nuclear arm ... race. the 
"ult Imate form of Ilolence." 
began the year Mahatma 
GandhI. the symbol of non-
violence. was assassinated. 
Before hi s death, GandhI 
started speaking out against 
the de\'elopment and prolifer· 
ation of nuclear arms. Bevond 
hi - words. Gandhi was a 
director of a non ,vlolence 
movement to gain indepen· 
dence for hi s country. a 
country compo, cd of 700.000 
sepa rate vi llages and millions 
of people. Thi movement. 
much like a movie. could not 
have been completed without a 
director. 

One of the lesson to be 
learned from the six tie is that 
the environmental and peace 
movements became frag, 
mented , disorganized . a nd 
lacked a unified direction. 
which resulted in frustration 
and loss of commitment 
towards the reaching of their 
goals. They needed a director. 
The movement of I he eight ies 
i ' towards nuclear eli . arm· 
ament and we cannot afford a 
similar loss of momentum, for 
the a lternative ma\ he the la"t 
\-\orld event, a nUl'lear 

holocau~t. 
We are in a lime of de~palr.

controls at he rock of the O's" 

By ANDRfW Kf[lLR 
TUESDAY, JANUARY 1 J - Shortly after 6 p.m. As 
Robert Plant expells the last excrutiating line of 
"Stainvay to /leaven ", Berlin follows Led Zeppelin 
on XTRA-fM (9JX) with "Sex " These two different 
songs exemplify the changing philosophy of the 
"new" 9/X. With one switch of the controls, 9JX 
went from the boring, predictable, AOR station to 
the "Rock of the '~Os. " Out with the oldandin with 
the new. 

The chief instigator of this rock and roll rebellion 
is Rick Carroll. Nailed by some as a savior and a 
prophet. criticized by others as a fool, the 34 year old 
California native is certainly one thing - HOT. Best 
known for taking over the nailing Los Angeles 
lation, KROQ, and knocking oft the heavyweights 

"There is a revolution going on in 
rock radio and its name is Rick 
Carroll. " 

- Robert Hilburn 
Los Angeles Times 

(KWS and KMET), Carroll has taken his radio 
roadshow sol:lth and is hoping for similar results. 

Although 9LX's ratings are not as bad as when he 
took over at KROQ in 1979 (3.5 compared to 0.8), 
Carroll still faces stiff competition from KGB (6.6) 
and KPRI (5.1). ("They're comfortable now, but they 
have to be worried after looking at our results in 
LA."), 

Carroll heads up a consulting firm that currently 
runs eight stations. Besides 91X and KROQ, he also 
programs what rock fans are hearing in Denver, 
Bakersfield, Seattle, Dallas, Phoenix and Tucson. He 
has his eyes and ears et on as many as 10 more 
stations, which could be hb " hopefully by the end of 
the year" , 

Li tener who have gotten a ta tc of KROQ s mu ic 
or what Carroll ca lls 'modern pop, have been 

Is 91X as good as everyone says? In 
the next issue of Hiatus, Mikel Toombs 
win take a critical look at the "Rock of 
the '80s" format which features what 
he calls "Dare to be Dumb" music -
not necessarily bad, just dumb. 

clammering for a " real " radio station in San Diego, 
91X is already making its presence felt. 

The day we talked, Carroll looked out the window 
of the station 's office on Pacific Nighway and 
pointed, "See out there, (pointing to no place in 
particular) As we speak, 175 billboard are going up 
around the city with the new logo (a graffitti looking 
"91X"). People will know we are here," 

Discussing next week ' line-up posing for a photo 
or checking on a plane reservation Carroll ha the 
look of a man who i BUSY, Interruption are the rule '

Carroll ha been a marked man, Juggling intenicw

things happen here in the '80s."

Atomicafe 
Absurd to sublime 

When asked about the new 
music scene in Canada, "eh?" 
was the answer given by 
com poser / pefo rmer Vic tor 
Zupanc, assuring us that his 
upcoming concert would be a 
good one, adding, " the fishing 's 
great. " 

The concert is Atomicafe. 
This concert will feature 
Canadian-born-and-raised Vict-
or Zupanc performing several of 
his own works as well as one by 
fellow colleague Robert 
Thompson and one piece by 
noted American composer. 
George Crumb. 

for two amplified pianos. The 
fourth Way will be performed 
by Suzanne de Montigny and 
Victor Zupanc. This contemp' 
lative work , as the tit le 
suggests, creates a very 
meditative, at times almost 
disturbing quality through its 
use of non-conventional piano 
techniques. The use of modal 
and harmonic elements, as well 
as the performers' use of rubber 
mallets, wooden dowels. 
plectrums. and their own hands 
inside the piano give the piece 
an eerie yet peaceful feel ing. 

Candy is a short tape piece 
which Zupanc will only describe 
as " the pop sound of the 90s." 

Zupanc is currently 
completing his Master's Degree 
in music composition. His love 
for performing often sways him 
in the direction of theatrical 
perform a nce pieces. Pieces 
ranging from the absurd . to 
sublime, to the macabre wi II be 
the order for this Feb. } concert. 

Zupa nc will perfor m 
Makrokosmos, a solo piano 
work written in 1972 by 
American composer George 
Crumb. This is a set of twelve 
pieces based on the twelve signs 
of the zodiac. At times quite 
vivid, attimes vague and almost 
subliminal. the haunting quality 
of this music is akin to the 
darker side of Chopin. and even 
to the child-like fantasy of early 
Schumann. 

The greatest traditional band in the world, The Chieftains, will appear in l'Iandeville Weds. at 8 pm. 

The concert wi II open with 
Cool, huh? (American). This 
piece, written by Zupanc for 
three male performers (Dan 
Dunbar, Tom Nee, Victor 
Zupanc), manipUlates a single 
phrase of text and creates, from 
its own rhythmic qualities, an 
array of sounds encompassing a 
wide range of rhythmic and 
melod ic textures. The source of 
the piece is the famous quote by 
Louis Armstrong: " Hot can be 
cool and cool can be hot. and 
each can be both, but hot or 
cool man, jazz is jazz. " 

Nothing beats a good Irish jig 
The Chieftains had the largest audience in history 

Zupanc will peform another 
new work of his own, th is one for 
solo voice and tape. Gag Me 
With a Pitchfork is a wild 
representation of contemporary 
" young" life and lifestyles. An 
absurd decade condensed into a 
more absurd five minutes. 

Atomicafe will be presentd at 
8 p.m. on Tuesday, in the 
Mandeville Recital Hall. The 
concert is l'ree and everyone is 
welcome. 

As if we weren't lucky enough 
to get Bill Monroe to perform on 
campus recently, The Chieftains 
will make an appearence at 
Mand eville Auditorium 
Wednesday, february 2 at 8 pm. 

Where Bill Monroe gave us a 
look at an American tradition, 
bluegrass, The Chieftains will 
give us a glimpse into the world 
of traditional Irish music : 
certainly one of the richest 
forms offolk music in the world . 

And speaking of rich music, 

The Chieftains are more 
qualified than any other group 
in the world to perform these 
compositions-many of them 
written by the legendary harpist 
Carolan. After two decades and 
12 a Ibums their world fame is 
indisputable. Most Americans 
are familiar with The Chieftains 
form their appearence on 
"Saturday Night Live " which 
was seen by a record 50 million 
viewers. 

However few people know 

that The Chieftains also have the 
distinction of having the largest 
live audience in history, further 
testimony to their world fame. 
1,350,000 people showed up for 
that performance for Pope John 
Paul II in Dublin . 

51.350,000 people can't be 
wrong! Tickets for the show are 
$6 Pi $ 7 for students, $ 7 & $8 for 
staff and administration, and $8 
& $9 for general admission. For 
more information call 
452-4559. 

The next piece is a new piece 
by Zupanc for guitar, voice. and 
tape. Lost to Sight will be 
performed by Victor Zupanc 
(voice), and Robert Ward 
(guitar), for whom the piece was 
written . and uses a four channel 
tape that was realized in the 
UCSD electronic studio. The 
piece is a political statement 
dealing with the destructive 
nature of our human race and 
the realization that whatever 
little hope we have left is fading 
fast. due to the mindless plight 
of the mindless people in 
control.

January 27, 1983 Hiatus 3 



Rick Carroll's 
"modern pop" 
continued from page 1 

Having been in the radio business for 20 years. 
Carroll has taken his share of risks. but doesn't see 
San Diego as a gamble. In fact he is excited and eager 
to talk about San Diego's "new radio leader". 

tliatus: What has the reception been to the " Rock 
of the '80s" in San Diego? 
Rick Carroll : Okay. out of the eight stations I 
currently consult. we have had the best reaction from 
here (91X). I think part of the reason is that many of 
the people from San Diego who are into this music 
can hear a little KROQ in North County or head up to 
L.A. to catch these kinds of bands in concert. 
Consequently they would hear the radio station or 
their friends would be talking about the station, and 
so the market has been set up for our format. 
lliatus: Critics of your format have said that it 
works in L.A. but would it work in say. Seattle or San 
Diego? 
Carroll : Well . (pause) we do about 80 percent 
KROQ in every city. and 20 percent local slant. Down 
here we are going a little more R & B and dance sound 
to attract listeners from HRM (92.5 fM). which is the 
number one teen station and number three overall in 
San Diego. 
tliatus: It seems that KGB and KPRJ down here 
closely resem ble the situation of KillS and KMET in 
L.A .... 
Carroll: Exactly. exactly; they're dinosaur rocks. 
tliatus: Since you have been here. have there been 
any noticeable changes in these stations? 
Carroll : We have noticed on a nationwide basis 
that these dinosaur stations have had significant 
rati ng decreases in the latest sweep of ARBs (Arbitron 
Ratings) and we feel that the KROQ format. or 91X 
format. is more potent and powerful than the KPRI or 
KGB format. And the example being we beat KillS 
and KMET in los Angeles. 
lliatus: Which is similar to the two down here •.. 
Carroll : They are practically the same and we feel 
we can beat them here as wel l. 

tliatus: looking at the Billboard sales chart you 
have Men at Work number one and Stray Cats at 
number two. Stations like KGB and KPRJ have just 
recently been adding these groups, Do you feel that 
the radio Ii tening audience is becoming more aware 
ilnd appreciates stations that are on top of the new 
music? 
Carroll: (grinning) We get on the records the 
minute they're released. The Stray Cats is a good 
example. We were on " Rock This Town" a year and 
half ago as an import. eight and a half months later it 
came out as a domestic release. Men at Work is 
another example. 
Itiatus: The Sparks new single, .. 
Carroll: "Modesty Blaise." as well as " The B-Movie 
Song." "I Eat Cannibals" and we have Human 
League's " Mirror Man." These are all imports that we 
get before they are even released in this country. 
through our connections in Europe. 
Hiatus: Although AM stations cannot avoid 

. playing groups like Men at Work. they are always a 
single or two behind the fMs. But what is surprising is 
that while KGB will be playing " Down Under" you will 
be programming " Be Good Johnny:' 
Carroll: That's kind of the pattern it will take. We 
will be one or two singles ahead. By the time we are 
off " Mirror Man." by the time it becomes a domestic 
release. it will probably have been number one on our 
chart and burnt out and we'lI slow it down and let the 
other stations get on it. We 'll constantly embarass 
the other stations as far as being the first on all the 
singles. 
tliatus: The other stations have been letting you 
take the risks and have been waiting to see what is 
hot and have gotten burned .. . 
Carroll : (smiling) That's the plan. 
Hiatus: AM radio, for years has been a wasteland 
for new music. and still is. but do you see the 
changi ng face of fM carrying over to the other side of 
the dial? 
Carroll: Oh yes. (leans forward) The whole society 
is much more " up tempo" and you can hear it in the 
music. 
tlia tus: You mentioned the teenage market. 
Everyone I know in high school is listening to the 
English Beat or Musical youth. Whereas when I was in 
high school. it was always " play Led Zeppelin, play 
The Who •.• " 
Carroll: Kids have changed. I'm a hippie: I 

1111. 

graduated tram Sacramento State in '69 and went 
through that whole deal. A'ld now there is another 
generation lhat never really had their own music 
before. If you're a kid going to high school. you would 
I isten to KGB. 91 X or KPRI and you ended up listeni ng 
to your older brother's and sister's music. the stuff 
they related to and got excited about. It seemed like 
radio had forgot about the kids today and wasn't 
givi ng them their own music. We're giving the young 
kids music that they can call their own that reflects 
their attidues and lifestyle that they're into. 
lliatus: Is the " Rock of the '80s" forgetting about 
the rock of the '60s and '70s? 
Carroll: We play Stones. BeaUes. and Doors. That·s 
as old as we get. We program about 75 pecent 
currents and 25 pecent oldies. 

"We'll constantly 
embarass the other 
stations as far as being 
first on all the singles", 
malus: One big concern or complaint I have been 
hearing is "91X plays good music. but II{eep hearing 
the same songs over: ' 
Carroll: Our format is geared to a four-hour 
rotation factor on the power songs that we get that 
our listeners want to hear - the records that are 
selling. The average listener listens about 70 minutes 
a day. so we have a three hour slack. The one thing we 
have noticed here is that people are listening longer 
because they are so tired of KGB or KPRJ that they 
listen. maybe. two or three hours a day. So. they'll 
complain about hearing the music too quick. but 
they have nowhere else to turn. The ones who 
complain are those that are more in tuned with the 
music and lifestyle. 
matus: Ideally these would be the people you 
program for ... 
Carroll: We are going for a super mass-split 
audience. This segment listens for a long period of 
time and gets bored sometimes. then the masses who 
listen while driving to and from work - maybe a

half-hour to an hour a day - are just getting to like 
the stuff we 're getting tired of. 
tliatus: Can 91X capture the same spontaneous 
personality that is the trademark of KROQ? 
Carroll: We have just opened the gates for the disc 
Jockeys as far as becoming personalities. If you 
listened to 91X before. they just read off the one-liner 
cards and couldn't really say much. They couldn't 
even say " It's a sunny day and I am out on my sailboat 
or surfing." they would get in trouble for that. Now 
we re letting that go and we 're slowly developing 
persona lities. 
tliatus: Are we listening to the same ills? 
Carroll: We didn't fire anybody. We did move the 
shifts around. Jimmy G. (J im Gelaro. the program 
director) and myself have been working with the 
Jocks. 
Hia tus: Has the emergence of Music Television 
MTV) had much of an effect on your programming?

down here to play. (The Psychedelic furs as well as

glad to here that. 
Carroll: These kinds of bands will be coming here

association. 

(Carroll apologizes for the delay, as he lakes two 
phone calls simultaneously). 
ltiatus: The life of a medra star. 
Carroll : (laughs) Yeah . look at what they did to 
me there (points to a photo in the Los Angeles 
Times) - I look like I have the mumps. I hate that 
picture! 
ltiatus: The record industry is blaming their 
sagging business on everything from home taping to 
video games. 00 you buy that? 
Carroll : Well . (long pause) it's a combination of a 
lot of things. It's really their own A & R (Artists & 
Research ) departments for not getting new bands. 
There is no reason to sign new bands when they will 
not get radio play. It works in a cycle. 
ffiatus: Tom Petty was quoted as saying. " I would 
rather put my money in a video game than buy an 
album these days. There are no good records coming 
out becuse the record industry is run by non-music 
people." 
Carroll: True. That's true. That's just the way it is. 
Many radio stations are like that; that's why you 
haven't seen these kind of formats. because they are 
unwilling to take chances on new music.

Young in 'Trans'ition 
By TOI'I TRUDEll 

Trans 
Neil Young 
Geffen 

Along with "Who played 
Lumpy on Lei1ve it to Beaver?" 
and "Who is buried in Grant's 
Tomb?" one of modem man 's 
most popular trivia questions is. 
" Whatever happened to Neil 
Young? " Well, it seems he is 
alive and well , for he's just 
released a new album, Trans. on 
the Geffen label. 

If there exists any pattern or 
trend in today's music, it could 
be the effort that a lot ofartists, 
both mainstream and 
peripheral, are making to 
"move into the Eighties," With 
Trans, Young attempts to place 
himself in the forefront of that 
movement. Only public opinion 
and the test of time will show if 
he is successful in that regard, 
but successful or not. one thing 
is certain: this is a very 
interesting album, an album 
totally unique in character. 

Those of you who were 
grooving to Wasted on the Way 
by Crosby, Stills and Nash this 
past summer may be more than 
a little dismayed if you expect 
Trans to follow suit. Half of it is 
reminiscent of the glory days of 
the Crosby-Still -Nash and 

I 
Young era, with songs like 
" Little Thing Called Love" and 
" Hold on to Your love" offerin~ 

traditional messages in the 
classically simplistic CSN&'Y 
style, The rest of it sounds like 
the soundtrack of Tron, with 
Young's use of computer-
enhanced vocals and various 
synthesizers to paint a 
somewha t melodramatic 
picture of the computer age, 
Songs like "We R in Control." 
" Transformer Man " and 
"Computer Age " attempt to 
dramatize the conflict between 
man and his machines for 
ultimate control. The theme 
works as far as it goes, but after 
a while it is possible to get a 
little tired of the contrasts on 
this record, and one starts to 
wonder just what the hell is 
going on, 

---for all my reservations, there 
are many moments of just plain 
good listening on this album 
("Like an Inca" is a definite 
winner), so if you don't let the 
often heavy-handed theme get 
in the way, you'll probably like 
Trans. Some will see it as a 
conceptual work on a grand 
scale, illuminating the 
increasingly mechanized 
hopelessness of the human 
condition, Others may find it a 
hopeless contradiction in wax. 
At any rate, it makes for some 
interesting listening while 
you 're not stUdying, and it gives 
you something totalk aboutata 
party. 

David Bowie to bands like the 
Who and soul vocalists such as 
otis Redding and James Brown 
providing enough room for The 
Drivers to develop an original 
sound of their own. As far as new 
music goes, Verbinski 
comments "I like a lot of the 
new music that is coming out 
now. What I really despise are 
bands like Rush and Triumph 
that take the ending of a song 
and make it ten times as long as 
the song itself, They've reached 
a state of just showing off 
instead of performing, I think 
performance is a level of 
coolness rather than complete 
gonzo ness." 

Also on the bill are UCSD'5 
favorite the Odds and East San 
Diego 's The Answers, The show 
begins at 9 p.m. and goes until 
one in the Rec. Gym, Tickets are 
$3, 

On Friday Translator will be 
playing at the Backdoor at 
SDSU, There will be one show 
only, so if you are planning on 
going, you should buy your 
tickets soon. Tickets are $6 at 
the Aztec center box office. 

Also Friday, the Dynatones 
will be performing R &' B at the 
Belly-Up Tavern in Solana 
Beach. 

final disc 
by the last 
of the Mods 

By KARL DA[<iUN<i 

Dig the New Breed 
The Jam 
Polydor 

The Jam, one of. if notthe top 
British "mod" band of the late 
1970s, has decided to call it 
quits after five years of topping 
the British record charts with 
such landmark albums as In the 
City, All Mod Cons and Sound 
Affects, 

Dig the New Breed is their 
farewell album, and one of their 
best It is comprised of live cuts 
recorded at various clubs in 
England and Scotland from 
1977 to 1982. Dig the New 
Breed ca ptures the energy ofthe 
Jam's live shows and best 
numbers with remarkable 
clarity. " Going Underground," 
"Dreams of Children" and 
"That's Entertainment" almost 
seem to leap from the grooves 
and come to life with the 
electricity of live performance, 

The old Jam classics don't 
lose any fire in live performance 
either; "All Mod Cons" and " In 
the City" are ground out with 
the Jam's trademark fury, and 
"Big Bird" is possibly the best 
cut on the album, 

Paul Weller, Bruce Foxton 
and William Buckler, the three 
members of the band, each have 
written a personal message of 
thanks on the album sleeve that 
sums up their final feelings as a 
group, I cannot help but feel 
that if they had been more 
widely accepted in the US they 
still would be producing their 
music with the same intensity 
that fueled their last few years. 

The failure to break the US 
mass market essentially broke 
the Jam, wh ich is a sad end to as 
great a career success as they 
enjoyed in the UK. Dig the New 
Breed is a definitive, powerful 
retrospective of a career that 
ended too soon. 

The original 'Cat People' will 
screen at UCSD on Tuesday 

By I'IIKtL TOOJI'IBS 
The Penguin film Society 

continues next Tuesday with an 
entertaining, albeit brief, 
evening of motion picture 
entertainment. The original cat 
People (1943) screens at 8 p,m, 
in USB 2722. 

Cat People was the first in a 
remarkable series of low-budget 
horror movies - which 
included the quasi-sequel Curse 
of the Cat People, I Walked With 
a Zombie and Body Snatchers 
(with Boris Karlofl) - produced 
by Val Lewton, Typical and 
probably the outstanding 
example of the series, Cat 
People is effectively under-
stated and to-the-point (it runs 
just over one hour), 

UEO presents 
two fine films 
this weekend 

The next two nights in 
Mandeville will provide 
enormous entertainment for 
film-goers on campus. Tonight 
is the West Coast Premiere of 
Constant factor, the new Polish 
film by filmmaker Zanussi. 
friday night. the film 
Committee at UfO will present 
Annie "all and Manhattan. two 
of Woody Allen 's best films, 
Both film programs will start at 
8 p,m, Tickets are $2 at the UfO 
boxolfice. 

Cat People tells the story of 
an exotically beautiful young 
woman (Simone Simon) who 
believes she is turned Into a 
fatal feline when her passions 
are aroused, In contrast to Paul 
Schrader's ludicrously graphic 

remake. Lewton and director 
Jacques Tourneur suggest. 
rather than depict, the horror of 
the situations, with moving 
results, 

Tickets are $1.00 at the Box 
Office.

Carroll: In Seattle we won 't play "What I like

{Again the phone rings}. 

like the Go-Gos, the Waitresses, Catholic Girls, etc. 
Carroll: Well , again I think one of the strong 
appeals of this forma t unlike the traditional KPRI or 
KGB that have a very heavy male stand - with the 
ha rd drivi ng guitar sound that can get very grating 
for the average lady. (thinking) Okay, they like these

few years?

Carroll: I love this kind of music. {leans back in 
his chair and points to the sound system that pours 
out the tunes that are swarming over America 's 
finest City, comfortable in the knowledge that he is 
the bringer of the storm}. 

CaITOII: The bands you mentioned transcend -
they play both modem rock and they are black-
oriented and hispanic-oriented. Those are the pefect 
records for us, but we have to be careful not to play 
too much of that stuff or we are accused of being 
disco - we have to keep the "hip" factor, 
lfiatus: It's good to see Michael Jackson get 
airplay on FM. 
Carroll: Oh yeah. It ·s great but KGB or KPRI are 
too hip to play it. (mocks disgust) "The Guy is

Dolphins, Skins prepare to finish off strange season 
By PHIL LAUDER Sports Edilor 

The 1982-83 NFL season has 
been one of comparisons. It 
was interrupted by a 50,some-
odd day strike by the players. 
just like the baseball season of 
the year before. The result was 
a n ine game seaso n, 
remini scent of the short 
campaigns of decades past Its 
Rookie of the Year wi ll be San 
Diegan-turned·Raider Marcus 
Allen, a man whose move-
ment closely resemble that of 
another former USC tailback. 
OJ Simpson . 

The NFL's playoff system 
this year can be compared 
with that of hockey, whereby 
any team composed of non · 
dead humanoid form s has a 
67% chance of earning a post-
season berth . And the two 
teams that ca me out of that 
mess will meet in Super Bowl 
XVII this Sunday at 3 pm in 
Pasadena's Rose Bow l. 

Take off the X f rom the XVII 

and you have Super Bowl VII. 
also played in Lm, Angeles. 
also between the Miami 
Dolphins and the Washington 
Redskins, Ten years ago, the 
Dolphins went througn the 
NFL's only perfect season (a 
17-0 reco rd ) which was 
culminated by a 14-7 win over 
the Redskins in the '73 Super 
Bowl. They made it there with 

Commen tary 

a strong D, the infamous "no· 
name defense," and with a 
controlled offense featuring a 
fullback the size of a jeep, #39, 
Larry Czonka. This yea r's 
Dolphins also feature a good -
make that exce lle nt 
defense, one which also has 
donned a cute nickname. "The 
Killer B's," a whole corp, of 
excellent defenders who work 
even bet ter as a unit. On 
offense. their jeep is Andra 

Dribblers play just 
well enough to win

At this point in the season, 
no one will confuse the UCSD 
men\, basketball team wit h a 
perennial powerhou se of 
Di\'is ion !II sta ture, but the 
Tritons a lways seem to 
perform just a little bit beller 
th an th e ir competitio n , 
Nothing could illust rate this 
point more succinctly than 
UCSD's 63-53 victory over Cal· 
Baptist Tuesday night in 
Triton Pavihon, Even thoullh 
t hey led t h roughou t the 
contest one had to wonder why 
the Triton s weren't blowing 
ou t the Lancers, a team with 
considerably less talent. One 
reason was that UCSD was 
forced into a slow, ha lfcourt 
game that didn't complement 
their run ·and·gun sty le of 
play , But another a nd 
proba bl y more insightful 
explanatioll was the Tritons' 
abu nd ance of fou ls and 
turnovers, as well as a 
s h\)ot ing pecclllage und er 50 
perce nt for th e th ird 
s uccess ive outi ng. lJCS[) 
turned the ball over 16 times 
(that 's 53 turnovers in a three 
game span), and committed 23 
foul s. most of them of the 
"reach-in " variety , These 
a ll owed the Ltncers 30 
chances from the charity 

stripe (compared to UCSD 's 
seven), yet the horne team sti ll 
\\as ten pOi nts beller than it s 
you nger. less experienced 
opponent. If it weren't for the 
Tritons' executing their zone 
offense "betterl han they have 
in a long time," according to 
Head Coach John HlclCk, the 
ou tcome probably wou ld have 
been a lot closer. 

Increasing their record to 9· 
8. ·1-2 in league play and a 
perfect 4 -0 at home. UCSD wi ll 
ha ve five days off before 
host ing Cal LUi heran next 
Tuesday at 8 pm , Coach Block 
and Ass istant Cuach Tom 
Marsha ll wi ll spend that 
respite working on one of the 
Tritons' major deficiencies: 
over-zealous fouling, 

When UCS D was not 
mauling t he Lancers. the home 
crowd (a rat her di sappointing 
onc compared to the Spirit 
Night crowd of 1000 last 
Frida v) was treated to a 
some-what dazzling pefor· 
mance by forward Ron Hicks,

them, collegiate or pro, turned

Wrestling in UCSD's libraries? 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Siaff Wriler 

On Jan . 2, the San Diego 
Sockers and the New York 
Arrows played an exciting 
soccer game with all the chills 
and thrills that any sports fan 
would eat up. The sky was 
filled with starts as a slight 
breeze bristled outside the 
Sports Arena. And the Jerk in 
the stands stayed away. 

You're familiar with the 
Jerk. He 's a regular at 
professional sporting event s. 
He's the creep who gets into a 
figh t every half-i nning at 
Padre games, and every 
quarte r at Clippers and 
Sockers contests. He , wi ll. 
down beer like a hog. The suds 
drip do\\ n hi" "hirt. 

He's the guy who leaned IntO 
the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
bullpen and lOld the visit ing 
pit hcers to go bleep them-
elves. Then he got Into a 

br a wl a nd inad vert en t ly 
mashed an unattended eight· 

yea r·old boy in the nose. The 
nose bled. the kid cried , and 
the Jerk didn 't not ice. 

During professional football 
games played in sub·freez ing 
wea.:her. the Jerk takes off hi 
shirt and re\'eals his flab. ThL 
makes him a man. If his team 
loses, he looks for someone to 
bea t up. This also makes him a 
man. 

The Jerk is confused by 
polite fans. No one is throwing 
up in the stands or shouting 
obscenities. He does not 
understand why people stand 

patiently in the food lines or 
wait their lurn in the 
bathroom. He wants to shove 
hot dogs in their faces for their 
polite manners and for the way 
they applaud the other team. 
He wants to stomp on their 
penny loafers and' tear the 
alligators off their hirts.

And where are t hose 
campus critics that clalln tha t 
UC offi c ial are closed· 
minded? Ha. they should have 
attend ed the All ·Campus 
Wrestling Tournament with 
the twenty or so administra· 
tors who traveled from as far 
away as the Bio·Med Library, 
to witne s the spectacle. It 
seems that library officials are 
confronted every year with the 
same gripe from students: 
"You don't provide artificial 
stimulants to keep the 

s t udents awake lO s t udy in t he 
tom bs of learn ing (Cent ra l and 
Bio·Med libraries; Cluster doe ' 
not qualify as a library)." 

o. to keep in step with the 
time. library offi cials and 
adminis trators traveled to the 
Main Gym on Wednesday. 
January 19, 1983, to watch an 
invigorating sport and to see 
how our libraries might 
incorporate it into their 
everyday routine . Officials 
gave a condensed version of 
what they saw and possibi· 
lities for immediate applica· 
tion: 

1) Wrest ling is. withou t a 
doubt. th most !-trenuous of 
all indoor sports. 

2) Instead of pass ing drugs 
out a t th e book re turn . 
libraries might remove several 
hundred of their worthIes 
books to create space for two 
mats on which students might 
improve th eir wres tling 
techniques and stay awake 
during final s. 

3) The idea of mats in the 
library would be conducted on 
a trial basis on the second floor 
of the Bio·Med for two weeks. 

A little background on the 
subject is sure to shed some 
light on the proposed idea.

Well, here it is January 27th ... four weeks 
into the New Year and guess what? Not 
one word yet from that ftushed-face squirt 
that we haw: all come to know and love. 
Remember ... ya, you know ... THE BUDMAN! 

It shouldn't be too surprising though. 
After all this is Budman's favorite month of 
the year. New Year's Eve parties to klck it 
off end Super Bowl parties to finish it up. 
And in between more six packs consu med 
than even Augie Busch could have 

dr~med. 
Aah yes ... our good friend the Budman 

end his lovely mistress Henrietta have had 
a grand 01' time ice-bagging their 
hangovers this January ... and just now he is 
beginning to feel a little bit guilty. 

I mean here we are, marching into the 
fourth week of Intramural Sports and not 
one solitary word has been written to 
glorify -the accomplishments and spirits 
(hiccup) of our UCSD athletes in action. 

Well, the Budman apologizes sincerely 
Md promiSes you a solid month and a half 
of introspective, detailed reporting. All 
the way up until St. Patrick's Day! 

In fact,just off the presses now is the first 
Bud Basketball Poll of the s~son ... e regular 
feature that lists in rank order the teams in 
1M Basketball that are last likely to win 
IntramurClI championships in March. 

ThCll's right. .. we said least likely. It 
appears after years of painstaking 
research, that the first Bud Poll of the 
seeson hes always been the kJss of deeth 
to those teams ranked CIt the very top. 
Only twice In 30 times has a team ranked 
No. One at the beginning of the season 
ever survived to capture the 
championship at the end of the quarter. 
And you think the cover of Sports 
Illustrated IS a Jinx! 

Poor Todd Watson (Capt. of AM Final ist 
of '82, Gym Morrison)!..1 can see him now 
flushing this article down the toilet. 

Oh well, baby, that's basketball For the 
rest of you, it you've got the nerve ... read 
on Clbout all of our ratings ... and then 
weep. That IS if your team has been ranked 
Numero Uno. Good luck! Hope you make 
It to March 13th. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday.January 27.1983 

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

AII-College Swimming 
Championship 

It will be CI sayonara of sorts for the 5th 
AIl-COllege Swimming Championships this 
coming February 5th. 

Even though the popular meet plans to 
continue for many years into the future, 
1983 will be the last time that the 
championships will be conducted in our 
current pool near the Main Gym. 

Next year's meet has already been 
targeted for UCSD's new 50-meter 
Recreation Pool on the east side of 
campus. 

Last year 15 Intramural marks were 
established In the most record-filled meet 
ever. MOst were garnered by a combined 
group of Med and Grad school 
competitors that joined forces to capture 
the team championship for the second 
time. 

The competition is open to Clny member 
of the university community (faculty, staff, 
student) with each competitor's finish 
automatically scoring points for his or her 
respective college or unit (Muir/ Revelle/

Staff). 

Sign-ups and the schedule of events are 
currently aVClilClble In the Recreation Gym 
Office through next week.

Hicks leads 
Tritons to 
ninth win 
continued from page 9 
those of Hicks certainly didn 't. 
21 points on ten of 18 shooting, 
a game· high nine rebounds. 
s ix assists, and on ly one 
turnover in 37 minutes of 
ac tion descri bed Hicks ' best 
outing of th e year, one which 
he down played cons iderably. 
''I'm just very happy to be 
playing," Hicks said as sweat 
dripped from his forehead . 
"Coach Block has given me a 
lot of confidence and hel ped me 
a grea t dea l. I think I'm 
s tarting to play the way I have 
a lways felt I could ." Besides 
being adept a t filling the lanes 
on the fast break , Hicks ' 
jumpshot , w hich reportedly 
had been on vacation , re turned 
Tuesday nigh t. Hitting from 
twenty feet a nd beyond , he and 
re s erve Brandon Ni xo n 
provided much of the second 
half scoring over the Lancers' 
2-3 zone. 

Although the halftime lead 
was five at 26-21, UCSD did 
receive a scare in the late 
going. When James Fuller of 
Cal-Baptist netted four of his 
16 second half points, w ith fi ve 
minutes to play, the lead was 
narrowed to s ix. The Lancers 
even had two opportu n ities to 
cut the deficit to four , but each 
time did t hemselves in by 
committing a turnover. T he 
Tritons then proceeded to pu t 
the game on ice with t heir next 
two possessions. A Hicks th ree 
point playoff a Dave McG uire 

· feed, followed by a Nixon 
interception and pass to a 
slicing Bob Goodman for a left · 
handed lay-up. soon propelled 
UCSD to a nine point lead . The 
63-53 victory came on a night 
when the Tritons played at the 
Lancers' level. "We play at the 
level of our competition ," said 

· Block after the contest. "But 
· that's ok as long as we win. 
When we play a team that is 
very good , we will play a long at 
that level as well." 

So despite a ll th e negatives 
- turnovers , fouls, a nd poor 
shooting - UCSD s till i ' in 
good shape as fa r as league 
play is concerned. According to 
Block. the squad wi ll continue 
to develop and wi ll be at it s 
pea k by playoff time. 

When it 's a ll said a nd done, 
that 's all th a t rea lly ma ller".

Before We Put You In ~e Of The World's 
Most Sophisticated Nuclear Equipment, 

We Put lou Thro Tbe W.Id's 
Most Sophisticated Training. 

It takes more than 16 
months of intensive 
training to become a 
fully qualified officer in 
the Nuclear Navy. You 
begin with four months 
of leadership training. 
Then as a Navy officer 
you get a full year of 
graduate-level training 

that most of the men 
who operate the 
reactors in private 
industry started in the 
Nuclear Navy.) 

I t takes more time 
and more effort to 
become an officer in the 
Nuclear Navy. But the 
rewards are greater, too. 

unavailable anywhere else at any price_ 
Navy training is based on more than 

1900 reactor-years of experience. Right 
now the Navy operates over half the 
nuclear reactors in America. And the 
Navy's nuclear equipment is the most 
sophisticated in the world. That's why 
your Navy training is and must be the 
most sophisticated in the world. 

The rewards can begin as early as 
your junior year in college. Qualify, and 
the Navy will pay you approximately 
$1000/month while you finish school. 

As an officer in the Nuclear Navy, 
you have decision-making authority 
immediately. You get important manage-

After four years, with regular 
promotions and salary increases, you can 
be earning as much as $40,500. That's on 
top of a benefits package that includes 
medical and dental care, and 30 days' 
vaca tion earned every year. More 
responsibility, more money, more future. 
So, if you 're majoring in math, 

ment responsibility 
fast. Because in the 
Navy, as your knowl-
edge grows, so does 
your responsibility. 

Your training and 
experience place you 
among the country's 
most qualified profes-
s ionals. (No surprise

wrestling 
tourney 
continued from page 10 
that libraries could hire the 
young wrestlers to teach 
others some basic moves and 
how not to "lose their lunch" 
after a hard workout. Also, he 
suggested that cooed wrestling 
might be studied as an 
alternative to flirting in the 
hallways. That idea, he said, 
could also be used " ... to beat 
the hell out of each other and 
meet new people." 

LAGO officials met after 
hearing the proposed idea and 
offered to buy a third mat for 
uni -s ex and fag -tea m 
wrestling. Statistics are being 
studied now. 

The newly formed wrestling 
club has offered to give clinics 
on such diverse topics a 
"Midget wrestling for your 
short friends," "How the half· 
nelson can save your 
marriage," and finally , 
"Backseat jungle: How to use 
your weight to overcome 
adversity. " 

"Wrestler of the Meet," 
Scott Foracker, who has won 
his weight class every year the 
tournament has run, has been 
singled out by library officials 
as one of their "ten most 
unwanted" students to use the 
new facilities. "All dese ]oes 
who know so mucht about 
wrasslin', shuddin ' t be 
hallowed to stude hear," an 
official library news release 
said. 

AS funds will not be used to 
subsidize the new mats, as the 
materials to make the 30' x 30' 
sponge will come from our 
cafeterias; each cafeteria will 
donate a week's worth of lousy 
dinner leftovers to be 
processes, dried, and cut into 
the necessary size. A Central 
Library location is being 
looked at and is under 
consideration by library 
officials.
