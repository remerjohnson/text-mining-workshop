Professor John Holdren delivered 
on Dec. II an acceptance speech 
for the Nobel Peace Prize on 
behalf of the Pugwash Confer-
ences on Science and World 
Affairs. The Pugwash organiza-' 
tion was formed in 1955 to bring 
scientists together to discuss the 
threat of nuclear weapons. 
Holdren has chaired the Execu-
tive Committee of the Pugwash 
Conferences since 19S7.ln his 
speech, Holdren warned against 
the continuing danger of nuclear 
arms. "Tbose who believe that 
the danger of nuclear destruction 
is now under control have simply 
not surveyed the new landscape 
of insecurity that the post-Cold 
War dawn has revealed," he said.

Executive Director Barbara 
Raboy estimates that 75 percent

students. According to Raboy, 
the donor selection process is 
competitive - only 16 donors 
out of 234 applicants were 
chosen this fall. A Cal student 
who identified himself as Leon 
explained the appeal of being a 
donor. "It's a lot of money for 
very little time," he said. "I don't

people do it anyway but just

Wilson Staves OfT '96-97 Fee Increase 
BUDGET: DC will 
receive $27 million 
from budget surplus 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Students throughout California 
breathed a collective sigh of relief 
on Jan. 3 when Gov. Pete Wilson 
announced that his 1996-97 budget 
would provide the extra $57 million 
necessary to prevent any increase in 

UC or CSU student fees . 
The $27 million the UC system 

will receive comes from what the 
California Legislative Analyst's 
Office estimates will be a $300 mil-
lion state revenue surplus, although 
members of Wilson's camp predict 
the actual surplus will be closer to 
twice that amount. 

"I thank [Wilson] for recogniz-
ing the need to keep student fees 
from increasing, while imulta-

COCAINE: Routine traffic stop

Associate News Editor 

The UCSD Police Department made its first 
arrest of the new year al 6:55 a.m. on Jan. I, 
when Sergio Leon was stopped and arreMed on 
Torrey Pines Rd. for driving without a license. 

The 21 -year-old Leon was charged with lhe 
possession of cocaine for sale, a felony under 
Section 11351 of the California Health & SafelY 
code, after officers discovered he was carrying 
several packets of the arug. 

Acco.rding to UCSD Police Sg!. Dave Rose, 
Officer John Cresap initially spotted Leon wail-
ing to turn left from La Jolla Village Dr. onto 

. Torrey Pines Rd. 
Rose said Leon waited through most of the 

green cycle before turning, which is a possible 
indication of a drunk driver. Cresap followed 
Leon and decided to pull him over after noticing 
thaI Leon's Pontiac Firebird did not have any 
brake lights:

when he was unable to produce a driver's li-

CEP May Limit Maximum Allowable Units for Double Majors 
PROPOSAL: Current 
maximum stands at 
200 units 
By Grace Jane 
Staff Writer 

The notion of a fifth- or sixth-
year senior may become a thing of 
the past if the UCSD Academic 
Senate's Committee on Educational 
Policy (CEP) rejects this quarter a 
proposal to raise the maximum num-
ber of units for double majors. 

Until Fall Quarter 1995, aca-
demic advisors had been approving 
students for double majors with the 
assumption that the CEP had ap-

proved the UCSD Council of Pro-
vosts' 1991 proposal for a separate 
maximum number of units for stu-
dents with double majors. 

During the summer, the CEP 
announced that it had never offi -
cially approved the proposal. Since 
then, academic advisors have been 
more cautious in approving addi-
tional units for students seeking 
double majors. 

The 1991 proposal stated that 
students seeking double majors be 
allowed to take up to 230 units be-
fore graduation - as opposed to the 
current maximum of 200 units for 
single majors - provided that they 
can do so in five years. The CEP 

" 

discussed the proposal at the time, 
but did not notify the provosts of 
any official decision. 

'The committee hadn't made a 
final decision," formerCEP Interim 
Representative of Student Affairs 
David Valentine said. "It was a mis-
communication. The registrar and 
provosts thought [the proposal] was 
passed, but the Academic Senate 
hadn't really passed it." 

Academic Senate secretary Eliza-
beth Wong predicted that any sort of 
discussion regarding double majors 
and the maximum unit limitation 
would not begin until mid-January, 
at the earliest. 

"I'm pretty confident that wecan 

convince [the CEP] that 230 units is 
reasonable for double majors," 
Revelle Provost Thomas Bond said. 
"I don't think it would be fair for 
students at UCSD not to be able 
have double majors if they can at 
other campuses." 

Double majors at UCLA are al-
lowed a maximum of 228 units, 
while those at UC Berkeley can 
accumulate 226. 

'The minimum progress is 36 
units a year, and that's only ISO 
units in five years," Bond said. "If a 
student can complete a double ma-
jor with 230 units in five years, I 
don't see why he shouldn't b\! al-

genes." Schroeder said. "But even 
if there are. it's an additive thing. 
So this gene will have to be dealt 
with if you want to reduce sodium

The UCSD researchers said the

sodium accumulation in soils and

mately a half billion dollars annu-

percent of irrigated fields world-
wide have become adversely im-

Professor Receives Enrico Fenni Award 
President Clinton named UCSD Professor Emeri-

tus Martin Kamen as one of two winners of the Enrico 
Fermi Award on Dec. 12. Kamen. 82. will receive the 
award for his discovery of ClIIbon-14 and his develop-
ment of Its use as a tracer atom. 

The Fermi Award. which carries a $100.000 hono-
rarium. is the govemment's oldest science and tech-
noloCY award and is granted for a lifetime of achieve-
ment in the field of nuclear energy. 

Kamen and the late scientist Sam Ruben discov-
ered Carbon-14. a radioisotope which is still in use. in 
1940. He developed Carbon-14 as a tracer In biologi-
Cill systems and applied It to his own research on 
metabolism and photosynthesis. Biologists. archae-
ologists and geologists use Carbon-14 for such appl~ 
cations as dating archeological finds and tracking 
carbon dioxide In the environment. 

A chemist. Kamen began his career as a radio-
chemist at Bert<eley's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. 
In 1945. he began wort< at the Washington University 
School of Medicine and became professor of biochem-
istry at Brandeis University in 1957. He began teach-

PINION 

Despite frequently having a . common heritage, British 
a~d American university students have different ideas 

as to what constitutes the best education 
s a foreign exchange stu-
dent from Great Britain, 
I have seen how stu-
dents live on both sides 
of the Atlantic. That 
is, I have attended 
both English and 

American colleges, and I have found sev-
eral differences in attitudes towards col-
lege life. 

Of coune, there are the stereotypes. 
In their own country, British students are 
often secn as living in squalor and spend-
ingthe taxpayers' money on alcohol and 
cigarettes. Americans, on the other hand, 
lend respect to their country's students, 
viewing them as hard workers out to bet-
ter themselves to the point of being con-
sumed with their studies. 

But in reality, the difference lays in 
the perceived goal of a college education. 
American education enforces a work 
ethic which prepares them for careers af-
ter earning a degree. British education, 
however, is secn as a time to reflect on 
one's'future while meeting and spending 
time with other people. As a result, uni-
versity life in British and American 
schools differs tremendously in the so-
cial infrastructure, the nature of sports 
clubs and the general attitude 
toward work.

sonal achievement- in both sports and 
academics - epitomizes the strong in-
dividualistic work ethic still present in 
American society. Because American 
universities are relatively new and were 
established primarily for education (and 
little else), they lack the distinct univer-
sity culture found in British collep$. a 
culture totally separate and different from 
anything one might experience in the 
everyday hustle-bustle of life. 

The UCSD campus. for example, is 
very fresh. Grass fields are neat, build-
ings new, sports and health facilities ex-
cellent. In contrast, British universities 
place less emphasis on grounds mainte-
nance, and their buildings represent 
architectual styles from several distinct 
time periods rather different modern 
buildings at UCSD. And where UCSD 
structures are big and sprawling, British 
university buildings tend to be smaller 
arid more centralized, with the Students' 
Union - the hub of all student activities 
- located in the center of campus.

"home university, the University of Hull, 
there arefi'H on-campus bars, three in the 
Students' Union and the remaining two 
in the sports center and faculty lounge. 

The following examples indicate, if 
not overstate, the markedly different pri-

. orities of British and American students: 
RIMAe's weisht room is the size of the 
main bar at Hull university, while Porter's 
Pub is the size of our weight room. 

In Britain, university life is generally 
less stressful. It is seen as a time to enjoy 
life, meet new people, experience new 
things, succeed academically and -
hopefully - make some career decisions. 
In many ways, it is a ''time ow" from the 
rat race of life. At American universities, 
life is fast-paced and slructured, forcing 
students to participate in the rat race. 

This idea becomes even more appar-
ent when dealing with sports. Sports clubs 
at British universities differ greatly from 
those at American universities. Although 
UCSD does not offer sports scholarships 
(unlike many American universities), 
sports programs are extremely important 
and are highly competitive. 

Spons are also important in Britain, 
but they tend to bring different social 
groups together, rather than attracl a cer-
tain type of "jock" student. British ath-
letes don't have schedule-makers or an 

NCAA ruling board - instead, 
British students must organize 

their own matches, tourna-
ments and weekend trips 
to other schools.

WHY BOTHER To SERVE UP PuBLIC 'EDUCATION? 
By F.rsem .... ab 
Special to the Guardian 

I attend a public uni versity 
(PU) in California by the name of 
UCSD. The "public" part of pub-
lic university means a whole lot 
of things. For one, it means that 
no one owns it, atieasl not anyone 
individual. The fact is that every-
one owns it - Ihat is, those who 
comprise the "public." And al-
though it is a PU, it is not like a 
public park or library, for not ev-
eryone is admitted. In this case, 
"public" simply means that the 
public pays for it and in some way 
owns it, but most essentially it ex-
ists for the public good - which 
I believe means for the good of ev-
eryone. 

So, in practice, what good is the 
PU to the public? Because the 
public subsidizes my education al 
my PU, the services provided to 
me are theoretically a lot cheaper 
than they would be at fair market 
value. The public gives a lot of 
money to our school to ensure thaI 
several public citizens recei ve col-
lege degrees. 

I ;Iave learned a lot of things 
- both academic and social - at 
my PU during the pasltwo-and·a-
half years. In a broad academic 
sense, I've gathered that because 
the public pays for schools of this 
ilk, it also has a say in determin-
ing the content of the curriculum. 
When you consider the many dif-

ferent points of view held by the 
public, it is no surprise Ihat the 
course load represents a cross sec-
tion of what the public thinks. 

In a specific sense, I've learned 
millions of ideas - and of all the 
ideas which I have learned on the 
academic front, my freshm!ln-year 
calculus instructor taught me the 
most important one. In that class, 
I learned a lot about the specifics 
of mathematics - the "trees" if 
you will - and how those trees 
made up the larger, more funda-
mental "forest. "In other words, I 
learned the importance of exacti-
tude and the possibility of cer-
tainty with knowledge. 

But everything changed during 
my sophomore year, when I took 
a literary theory class. I came out 
of it very confused. This course 
undid everything I had gleaned 
from my calculus class about ex-
actitude. Aside from being told 
that I was on my way to becom-
ing some sort of serf under some 
sort of modern, industrial feudal-
ism (to which my professor re-
ferred as a "wage slave"), I was 
indoctrinated with two key les-
sons: Objectivity is a myth, and 
society makes me what I am. 

These provocative, academic 
ideas undermined what I had pre-
viously believed and left me reel-
ing for months as I struggled with 
this seeming contradiction. That 
is, until I took two classes which

proved to be a very pivotal part of 
my educational ellperience at my 
PU. One was a multiculturalism 
class in the anthropology depart-
ment and the other was a quantum 
physics class. They straightened 
everything out: I learned that ev-
erything is just relative, whether 
it is one's perspective on the posi-
tion of an electron or one's per-
spective on war or one's perspec-
tive on gender. Truth has many 
facets, they told me.

In between all these classes, I 
also had the opportunity to dabble 
in another discipline which turned 
out to have some bearing on my 
personal ideology. I had this silly 
notion, for I don 'I know how long, 
that Truth - in a definitive form 
- was attainable (no doubt a 
product of my environment). It 
took a UCSD philosophy course 
to shake some sense into me. I 
don't recall exactly what it was 
that professor taught, but it was 
something about "things as they 
appear are not things as they -" 
I never seem to be able to remem-
ber that one. 

The irony of it all was that I 
was dumb enough to go into that 
class thinking I was going to learn 
answers to questions like: Is there 
Truth in life? What is the mean-
ing of life? Does man have free 
will? Now, I can see that I was 
taught much more interesting and 
relevant malters, such as: Is there 
any real difference between man 
and amoeba? What if my life is 
just a dream, and all of you are just 
unpaid actors in it? What is the 
real meaning of "what?" Oh, and 
then there was this mind-boggling 
concept-exercise I was given 
which particularly floored me. I'm 
still turning this one over in my 
head. Try and deal with this: ''This 
sentence is not true." 

Looking out of this public aca-
demic jungle, sometimes I won-

der why our university has to be 
public at all. Public universities 
help ensure that everyone gets 
educated, yet they do not neces-
sarily ensure that students receive 
a quality education. Because the 
PU must cater to the public, it is 
forced to olTer a multitude of shal-
low courses, instead of enforcing 
an objective and focused curricu-
lum. Though the wide selection of 
courses may be appealing. once 
enrolled it becomes immediately 
apparent that there is no depth to 
these courses. In its attempt to . 
please the public, the PU has sac-
rificed quality for quantity, and 
therefore only offers the student 
an empty education. 

Just because an education is 
necessary to each member of the 
public, the public is not necessar-
ily the best administrator of this 
education. To make my !!Oint, I'll 
use an analogy: Imagine what pub-
lic restaurants would be like . 
Would they be belter? Would all 
people then get food? The closest 
thing I can think of is public-
school cafeteria food. I have lots 
of vivid, negative memories or my 
public-school cafeteria food. 
There may have been a lot of 
choices, but none of the dishes 
were ever satisfying. Somehow, I 
think that kind of food is not too 
far off from what public restau-
rants would be like. And the same 
can be said for public education.

6 OPINION 

CLASH: u.s. 
students don't find 
time to socialize 
ConIIIIued from .,... 4 

In fact. the very essence of ath-
I~tics differs greatly between the 
British and American schools. Brit-
ish students have more free time, 
giving them the lbility to play sports 
without sacrificing essential study 
or socializing time. They allO don't 
have to maintain a certain grade-
point level in ordcrto compete. An-
other key difference is that sports 
clubs at British universities are not 
primarily money-making ventures. 

Any profit earned by a ICam goes 
back into the spons program. which 
is run by students for students. 

And this philosophy carries 
over to overall social activity. The 
National Students' Union partici-
pates in all areas of student life. 
so British students are much more 
involved in how their school is run 
than American students. British 
student life is clearly focused on 
campus. Student representatives 
are involved in all university is-
sues, from keeping Wednesday af-
ternoons free for spons to ensur-
ing reasonable rates for campus 
housing. 

In terms of social habits, .Brit-

The UCSD Guardian 

ish students tend to be more spon-
taneous, while American students 
are more organized. (Indeed. they 
must be to survive the brutal quu-
ter system.) 

At UCSD, students scunle from 
lecture to lecture. pen and paper 
ready to scribble anything which 
could possibly improve their 
grades. In Britain, however, stu-
dents stroll aimlessly from one 
lecture to another via the bu, of-
ten staying there and completely 
fO'letting they had a lecture to at-
tend in the first place. This state-
ment is rather eUllerated, and 
deliberately so, to get the idea 
across thai British students have 

more freedom to choose what they 
want to do with their time. Aca-
demic work is nol as much of a 
priority as it is for American stu-
dents. 

Like all aspects of the Ameri-
can university experience, social 
life - what little of it does exist 
at UCSD - is very organized. Al-
though the Greek system is not as 
popular at UCSD as at other uni-
versities, it is a prime example of 
an American organized social ac-
tivity. UnfOllunately, the stereo-
types of lhe "frat boy" and "soror-
ity girl" ue almost roever positive.

opment of communication and or-
ganization skills. Again, this dem-
onstrates the American ethic of 
goal-oriented achievement - a 
trait that sets the United States 
apan from Britain. 

The American university expe-
rience forces students 10 be good 
time managers. The emphasis on 
achievement prepares students well 
for the world of work. 

The British university experi-

UCPresidenl RichanlAlkiDlOl'lsaid. 

Under the governor's proposal. 
mandatory sbIdenl fees for Califor-
nia residents would remain at $3,199 
for the third consecutive year. Fees 
for non-residcnts and certain gradu-
ate students would still increase. 

Althougb reaclions to the 
governor's announcement varied, 
mosI studentsandadrninislnllors were 
content with Wilson's decision. 

"I was of course tremendously 
relieved and plcascd 10 Icam thai the 
governor supports no fee ir~:I'CMC," 
Interim UCSD Chancellor Mujoric 
Caserio said. "1 seemed the obvi-
ous and right thing 10 do." 

Wibon's "compact with higher 
eGacaIion." introduced in this year's 
SIIIe budget. calls for increased state 
funding in exchange for regulu fee, 
enrollmentandprocb:tivily incrc:ases 
among the UC and CSU systems. 

Although fee increases would 
have been offset by increased finan-
cial aid, UCSD Student Financial 
Services Director Vince DeAnda 
agreed that eliminating any increase 
was the best choice of action. 

"It's great news," DeAnda said. 
"It puts us in a better position so that 
we don't have to ask the stUdents to 
pay more in fees." 

DeAnda's dcputment awarded 
students roughly $ 103 million in 
loans and grants for 1995-96. 

Citing the massive debts accrued 
by many families as they put their 
children through college, Lt. Gov. 

Gray Davis hailed Wilson's an-
nouncerncnl thal funher student fee 
increases an: "boch unwise and un-
ncccssary." 

"It is not unusual for parents to 
take OUI a second mortgage on their 
home ... to pay for ~ in-
cralcd college cosu," he added. 

Wilson provided the UC system 
with $21.5 million last year to stave 
off a proposed IO-pen:cnt fee in-

crease, although the university had 
to Cllt $9.5 million from elsewhere 
in the budget to make up the differ-
ence. 

According to Wilson, ''the pr0m-
ise of affordable, accessible and 
high-qualily college and university 
education, wbich was made to past 
generations of Californians, is be-
ing kept and renewed." 

Some, however, looked at 
Wilson'announcement morecyni-
cally. 

"It's about goddamned time," 
A.S. President Naomi Falk said. "But 
I don'l think he's suddenly grown a 
heart. The f* have gone up so 
much that thetc's no more room to 
raise them." 

Mandatory UC student fees have 
risen more than 300 percent in lhe 
last 10 years, from $1 ,245 per year

in 1986-87 10 $3,799 in 1996-91. 
Campus-specifIC costs bring UCSD 
total student fees 10 $4,200. 

"(Fee increases] gol to be some-
thing you expected," W ~n junior 
Jayson Lorenzo said. "You just 
didn't think about il" 

Revelle senior Richard Walters 
also said the governor' 5 announce-
menl came as a surprise. 

"I thought fees would keep JO-
ing up, especially since Wilson is 
still in there," Walters said. 

Others, such as Stale Senator 
Lucy Killea, an independent whose 
district includes UCSD, were con-
cerned that the governor' sannounce-
ment held little substance. 

"[Capping student fees] is very 
nice, but it doesn't say anything 
aboul his policy," Killea said. "I 
hope it means a deeper concern for 
higher education's role in the future 
and government's role in il." 

Some saw the governor's alloca-
tion as a response 10 the UC regents' 
November 1995endorsementofthree 
budad priorities for I ~91: making 
faculty salaries cornperabIe to other 
insbtulions, avoiding a sbIdenl fee 
increase and increasing funding 10 
srudent outreach programs. 

"We think it's great [Wilson's] 
making higher education a priorily, 
but we' re still wary of what's going 
to happen with the rest of the bud-
get." UC Student Association Ex-
ccutiveDirectorKimi Lee said. "We 
need millions of more dollus for 
our outreach programs." 

Wilson officially releases his 
budget, which the state legislature 
must still approve, on Ian. 10. Al-
though he has not provided any spe-
cifics, Wilson promised to maintain 
community college f~ at their cur-
rent levels as well.

A test performed at the police

the drugs were for sale because of 
the way lhey were packaged and 
carried. 

The District Attorney's office 
has allO chuged Leon with the 
illegal transportation of drugs. 

Leon remains in custody at the

drug charges, he faces between 
five and 10 years in state prison.

In 1994, 20 arrests resulted from 
21 reported drug or narcotics of-

According to Rose, most ille-
gal drug use on or around campus 
is by non-affiliates, similar to the 
cases of Leon and Verjil. . 

"It's hard to know the level!of 
drug use among students," he said. 
"It's very difficult to know what 
goes on behind closed doors." 

Rose added that methamphet-
amines seem to be the drug of

society." Whatever action taken 
by the CEP on this issue, Wong 
said the committee would try to 
implement the action in a way that 
is least detrimental to the students. 

"[CEPj is trying to help stu-
dents get through here in four 
years, if [studentsj are able," Wong 
said. 'That's the riding principle 
behind the maximum unit limita-
tion." 

According to Bond, a student 
exceeding the maximum number 
of units would be required to com-
mit to a graduation plan or take 
courses through University Exten-
ion. 

" [The maximum unit Iimita-
tionj is not enforced very rigor-
ously in the sense lhal we don ' t 
kick anybody out when they cross 
that number of units," he said. "It 
just doesn't seem to be in the 
student' s best interest to stay so 
long . I usually worry about a stu-
dent who's been around for more 
than fi ve years."

common joke at the restaurant 
where I worked for four years 
was that one day. immigration

all the "illegals" in the kitchen. 
The idea being. of course. !hat 

the restaurant would have to close down for lack 
of employees. 

At home. in San Jose. the U.SlMexican bor-
der doesn't really exist We aren't absolutely 
ignoranl: We know there is illegal immigration. 
we know there is a border. we know there are 
issues - and we don't care. Because we enjoy 
the privileges of U.S. citizenship. we live in a 
different universe. Mexico is a fairy land of cheap 
food, liquor and procb:ts; the border is nothing 
more than a boundary to be crossed; the iIIegais

My mother (who had made me promise not 
10 go 10 Mexico) upon hearing I was going to 
Mexico. via my sister: 

"You can be snatched. you know. You could 
be driving down there and bandits can come and

"Don'tdrink the water. take your own water.

Continued from ..... 10 
one spot. Have fun." 

A donnmate. upon hearing aboul my deci-
sion to write about Tijuana: 

"Dude. what's there to tell aboui Tijuana? 
Man, this is how your paper is going to tum oul: 
·Man. I was wasted... The. Entirt. Time. So 
fucking drunk and so fucking high. man. I was 
jlyin '! Grabbed me a couple whores and let them 
do their thing. paid 'em five bucks and I was 
outta thert! Then, I was pissing on a wall and 
some cop said something about going to jail, so 
I paid him ten bucks and I was ouna ,here! 
Checked OUI a ck>nkey show for the firsl time. 
couldn't believe it, checked it out a second time 
and wllLlt a show! OOOWWWl On my way out. 
bought me nine Mexican blankets rorfiftybucks! 
I'm set for Christmas! Tijuana's stylin'! 

"Now. water is a fucking universal solv -" 
"What's a donkey show"!" 
My roommate's jaw drops. "Duuuuddde. you 

don 't/cnow about donk£y shows? I knew aboul 
donkey shows when I was 10. It's a show, and. 
like, well. old prostitutes gel it on wilh donkeys 
when they can' l gel it on with anyone else. It·s, 
like. the only way they can make money now. 

"Yeah. like. it's weird the firsttime and all," 
he continues. pulling on a pair of dirty socks. 
Dirty laundry looms behind and above him, 

spilling out of its hamper. "But, the second time 
-" he says, looking me dead in the eye. A grin 
breaks out across his face. "-OOOWWWl" 
........... 

'The man in the booth waits. I hand over five 
dollars. He nods. says something over his shoul-
der to the man sitting behind him. The candy-
striped. wooden barrier trembles as il lifts. A 
second later and my car is safely parked, still on 
the American side. 

People mill about, wandering up and down 
the street Across the way. Jack 'n' the Box is 
packed. Two tacolhol dog stands occupy 0ppo-
site comers of the intersection. One fiftyish-year-
old man standing by the closest stand bites some-
thing wrapped in a tortilla and exclaims. "Hot 
damn! ThaI's hot!" His wife wipes the comer of 
his mouth and warns him to "be careful." Beyond 
the intersection, the last paved block clearly held 
by the United States leads up to a forness-like 
edifice which stretches across Interstate 5. 

fentertheedificeand am immediately slapped 
across Ihe face with the rancid smell of piss. The 
smell fades - but never quite disappears - as 
I climb the semi-enclosed spiral pathway lead-
ing upward. Taggers have left their marks along 
the walls: .. SHlM." .. EPLURlBUS, .... BLANCA 
BAB Y!" I make a game of avoiding wet streaks 
spiraling their way downward.

walkway, ot~n appear stony-eyed, beetle-

Library Walk 
Draws Fire From 
Faculty and 
Students 

The $2.5 million campus Library 
Walk. slated for construction later this 
month. has drawn heavy criticism from 
facully members and sludent groups an-
gry overperceiyed administration misin-
fonnation about the project. 

When completed. the 30-foot-wide 
walkway will run from the University 
Library to the new Cellular and Molecu-
lar Medicine Building and will require 
the removal of 230 eucalyptus trees. 
Nearly 700 trees will be planted a10ng the 
wallt upon completion. 

Questioning the need to spend oyer $2 
million on the project, UCSD Physic~ 

I Professor J<qe Hirsch said that simply 

dosing Hutchinson Way to vehicle traf-
fic would be sufficientto allow safe use of 
Cla~sroom Building One - a main pu~­
pose o f the walkway. 

Hirsch also countered the 
adminislration ' sassertion that 50 percent 
of rhe eucalyptus trees in the grove were 
infected with eucalyptus beetles. 

'1"ht: campus told us [the trees) are 
sick .. .. The campus is lyingtous."Hirsch 
said. CALPIRG and otherenyironmental 
groups backed Hirsch's sentiments. 

Howeyer. Ihe Academic Senate 
soundly defeated Hirsch's motion to post-
pone construction on the Library W Ilk.

Falk Elected 
As New A.S • . 
President 

In the highest voterlumoul since 1988. UCSD 
students elected Naomi Palk as. A.S. president 
and rejected referenda to fund club sports and a 
football team in last week' s elections. 

Over 3,200 students cast their ballots dur-
ing the three-day election, totaling abOut 23 
percent of the student body. Nearly one-third 
of the student body voted in the 1988 elec-
tions, when a similar football referendum 
appeared on the ballot. 

Falk, running under the Legalize It slate, 
garnered 51.6 percent of the vote to edge out 
John Bames. 

"I'm pretty satisfied." said Falk. "We haven' t 
had as progressive a president in the last four 
years, and it's aboultime." 

Both the club-sport referendum and the fOOl-
ball referendum suffered defeat at the polls, 
pulling in 60.7 percent and 38.7 percent of the 
vote, respectively.

A.S. Subsidize. 
Alcohol for 
TGIF Event. 

Due in pan to efforts made by Associated 
Students Commissioner of Programming 
Kevin Moo, alcohol wi II once again be served 
at TGIPs (TGs) next year. 

The UCSD 0IWdian 

The TGs will be held at 
Porter's Pub on alternating Pri-
days. According to Moo. the 
Pub was selected as the site for 
the TGs because it serves as I 
loophole in the administration's 
dry-campus policy and a way 
to comply with the Alcohol 
Beverage Control's rules. 

"Poner's is zoned [for alco-
hol consumption)," Moo said. 
'The owner of Poner' s Pub has 
to sell in pints ... within his costs 
[and) within the confinesofthc 
law. It will cost 50 cents a pint 
for quality alcohol. Soft drinks 
and water will be free." 

Moo added that Poner' s Pub 
will be a good site for TGs, 
even though space is limited to 
780 people.

Atkinson 
Chosen for 
Top UC Post 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson 
will become the 17th president ofthe Univer-
sity of California on Oct. I, taking over for 
retiring President Jack Peltason. 

The UC regents selected the 66-year-old 
Atkinson after their first choice, Ohio State 
University President E. Gordon Gee, with· 
drew from consideration. This occurred after 
reports surfaced that he had secretly approved 
bonuses for his aides during his 19805 tenure 
as president at the University of Colorado. 

''The University of California has fulfilled 
the hopes and aspiroltions of Californians for the 
past 127 years," At.k..inson said. "I am honored to 
be a part of this great tradition and will take 
whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the 
university fulfills its leadership role."

Regents Abolish 
Affirmative 
Action 

In a controversial vote cast July 20 in 
San Francisco, the UC Board of Regents 
narrowly approved a resolution to discon-
tinue affirmative·action policies in univer· 
sity admissions, hiring and contracting. 

The new policy adopted by the regents 
says that, effective Jan. I, 1997,the univer-
sity "shall not use race. religion, sex. color, 
ethnicity or national origin" as factors in 
admissions. The policy is identical for hir-
ing and awarding contracts, which has an 
effecti ve date of Jan. I, 1996. 

As a result of the regent's historic vote, 
the UC system becomes the nation ' s largest 
public university to reject affirmative ac-
tion . 

The board ' s decision to eliminate affir-
mative·action programs has prompted vari-
ous responses from students. faculty and 
staff connected with the UC system. 

"It is a huge step backward for the uni -
versity," UCSD A.S. President Naomi Falk 
said. "We will see the effects of this into the 
next decades, as it will negatively impact 

the student population and quality of educa-
tion as'a whole at the University of Calif or-
nia." 

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, after the vote, Gov. Pete Wilson 
lauded the new policy. 

"The adoption of [these measures] says 
California's diversity should be achieved 
naturally rather than through preferences," 
Wilson said. 

San Diego 
Remembers 
Rabin 

Scores of UCSD students were among the 
1,500 moumers at the Beth EI Synagogue in La 
Jolla on the evening of Nov. 6 for a memorial 
service in remembrance of the slain Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 

The service. which consisted of several speak-
ers, paid tribute in both Hebrew and English to 
the assassinaled leader. 

Rabin. who shared the 1994 Nobel Peace 
Prize with Vasser Arafat and Shimon Peres, was 
fatally shot at a peace rally the morning of Nov. 
4 by a 25-year-old, right-wing extremist.

and chests out; women clutch the men or 
each adler, their eyes dan back and forth. 
Some giggle nervously. A few people, red-
faced and glassyoCyed, returning from 
Tijuana, are laughing drunkenly. 

Down the opposite spiral. s8me marks, 
same smell, same attitude. 

There are no posted directions; 1 walk 
south to a fence of bars with a revolving bar 
door. As the doo. 's bars pass through the 
barrier. they smack metal handles attached 
to the fence, sending out deep, loud clangs, 
an advisory to taxi drivers and peddlers 
awaiting us on the other side. 

Crossing over the line demarking the 
actual boundary of the two countries •• see 
three young men posing for a young woman 
with a camera. They model nextto a cement 
block with "MEXICO" chiseled into it, the 
letters painled in the green, red and white of 
the Mexican flag. Further down, peering 
through the bars which separate their nation 
from ours, a crowd of dark-haired, dark· 
skinned boys watch us. 

I step through the revolving door and 
push the bars until, finally, I am in Mexico. 

"You want a taxir' (Yoo wahn 'na 
tahk' see?) 

"I drive a good taxi ," (l 'ee dri 'va goo'd 
tahk'see.) 

"Need a taxi, no?" (Nee'd ah tahk'see, 
no?) 

Details are fuzzy here - the three times 
I've crossed the border have been hazy 
entrances, a son of shell shock. There's a 
sharp·angled, half·dome, tan·brown build· 
ing. The building slands opposite of the 
U.S. fortress which coldly looms beyond it, 
as intimidating as any sheer rock face. 
Tijuana's answerto that coldncss rnust have 
been this structure, which probably looked 
futuristic in the I %os or • 70s. It may have 

The UCSD Guardim 

been beautiful, once. The curves and edges 
somehow work togeIher 10 create an im-
pression of vigor, a look which most of 
Tijuana. mostly ~ted of chipped 
blocks of concrete or wood set into squat 
rectangles, belies. 

But the building is debililaled: Slats of 
wood show through the oddly·angled aw· 
nings. the tan-brown paint is flaking off the 
entire structure, empty windows reveal 
empty lobbies. 

Outside the building, three or four maIS 
lie on die ground, and women wrapped up in 
blankets occupy the mats, silendy offering 
theirwares - beads, figurines, woven bnIce-
lets- to the blinking people coming through 
the metal maw of the revolving door, people 
who continue to look away, not willing to 
buy until they reach Avenida Revoluciott. 

A little way beyond the building are doz· 
ens of cabdrivers olTering their services. Past 
the first aggregation of the many taxi dri vers, 
street vendors, taco stands and poor women 
and their children in Tijuana. I head west • 
cross a slJeet and enter a square filled with a 
collection of restaurants/clubs and shops. 

"Eh, eome to my place," suggests a 
barrel-chested, shon man, walking along 
with me as I pass a club. He breathes 
heavily, his drawn brows and funowed 
eyes do not welcome us. His words, how· 
ever, distort his demeanor. ". am your host, 
my friend. Look, I give you free margaritas, 
they are on me. Come in and sit down, ehY' 

''I'm sony, I'm nol -" 
"My place, it is clean- c1eanesl kitchen 

in Tijuana. You need rest, no '! Come rest at 
my place - good music, food , drinks, 
dancing." I walk. "And chips! I forgot the 
chips, no? Free chips and salsa!" 

"I'm sony, we' re nol -" 
But the man needs to make another 

point about his place. In lhe background, 
other people speak: 

"Come here, amigo. You need a drink." 
"Don'l go to his place, amigo. He has

22 SPORTS The UCSD Guardia 

Winter Produces Four Wins SPEEDO: Women qualify eight

hurting. The flu hid slowed pards 
MarciaJeffries and Franzen; and with 
William Smith boasting a perfC(;t 6-
o mark., the Tritons needed all the 

enough to satisfy the coach, all five 
freshmen on the Triton team sped to 
NCAA qualifying times in their 
events. Kelly Byrne was the leader 
of that pack, as she smashed a pair of 
school records in the 100 (I :07.32) 
and 200 (2:23.10) breaststroke 
events. Byrne also raced to a stellar 
qualifying time in the 200individual 
medley (2: 10.70). 

'Tis the season ... for women's 
hoops? Yup, over the winter hiatus

team continued to 
battle top ranked 
foes. The Tritons 
went 4-2 during the 
break, which in-
cluded a tough 
stretch when they 
played four ranked 
teams in five days. 

UCSD, which is not in a confer-
ence, opened its winter-break 
schedule on Dec. 2 against Pomona 
Pitzer, a favorite 10 win the South-
ern California Intercollegiate Alh-
letic Conference (SCIAC). 

The Sagehenscame into the game 
with an unblemished, 5-0 record. 
However, the Tritons had no inten-
lion ofbecorning victim number six, 
aslhey took the 69-66 lriumph. Eigh-
teen points from Cindy Yamasaki 
and 16 from Amy Franzen led the 
way for UCSD. 

UCSD Invite. 
UCSD's opening-
round game against 
Muhlenberg 
marked the first of 
four straight con-
tests against ranked 
foes. Muhlenberg 
came in riding high 
with a 7-1 record on 
the season, but the 
Tritons brought 
them crashing back 
to Eanh with a re-
sounding 79-66 win. 

"I think 
[Muhlenberg] was 
surprised," Malone 
said. • 'They dido' t 
expect us to be this 
good. It was close at 
the half, but we 
pulled away early in 
the second half." 

Fellow freshmen breaststrokers 
Sarah Chu and Linda Monroe also 
made the NCAA cut times in the 100 
and 200 breaststroke races. Kristi Jor-
dan, competing in the backstroke, 
continued the trend of unparalleled 
early season success by reaching the 
NCAA standards in both the 100 
(I :01.10) and the 200 (2: 10.44). 

The final freshman to leave her 
mark on the meet for the Tritons was 
Jenny Irwin, who made the NCAA 
cuts in the 50. 100 and 200 freestyle 
races. 

UCSD springboarded from its 
success in Long Beach to what 
Coach Boyd termed, "the best 
Christmas training we've ever had, 
in terms of the work that we put in 
and the performances that we got in 
workouts."

peeted in a meet alainst the Air 
Force Academy. on Tues., Jan. 2. 
Both the men ad the women swam 
less speedily than expected, and 
the UCSD team was buoyed only 
by the pcrformlCes of a few swim-
mers. 

On the men's side, seniors Kaley 
Parkinson and Mike Jefferson both 
turned in quick times in the 100 
freestyle. Parkinson also swam well 
in the 200 freestyle, taking second 
in I :49.43. David Tudury's swim in 
the 200 individual medley (1M) was 
the final light in the darkness fort he 
Tritons. 

For the women, Irwin swam 
solidly in the 50 and 100 freestyle 
events, while fellow freshmen 
Byrne stormed to a first-place fin-
ish in the 200 1M (2: 14.34) and a 
second solid showing in the 200 
breaststroke. 

Parker and senior diver Sheri 
Takeuchi also helped carry the sag-
ging Triton banner on this day, as 
they finished well in the 200 back-
stroke and one-meter springboard, 
respectively. 

"I was upset [with our perfor-
mance against] Air Force be-
cause we were physically ready 
to swim fast, but mentally, a lot 
of people just didn' t choose to," 
Boyd said. 

The Tritons hope to correct that 
problem as quickly as possible in 
order to perform their best down the 
season's home stretch.

THE' CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMI 

Husker Hicks 
Hoard Title 

Repeat. Back-to-back. Two 
in a row. No matter how you 
say it, the Nebraska 
Comhuskers football program 
accomplished a great feat by 

• winning its second-consecutive 
national title last week. 

, ... 

... 

In completing its undefeated 
season, the Huskers man-
handled the Florida Gators like 
a bunch of hicks applying half-
Nelsons to some poor, 
defenseless alligators in the 
Florida swampland. 

This was supposed to be a 
classic duel between the 
number one-ranked Huskers 
and the seCond-ranked Gators. 
It was two powerful offenses 
going head-to-head for the 
right to claim a perfect season 
and a national title . 

The game of the century, 
however, looked more like a 
Super Bowl: Final score: 62-
24. And it wasn 't that close. I 
could throw out meaningless 
stats to chronicie the Nebra ka 
dominance, but I don't have 
enough space. 

The Husk~rs dominated 
every team they played this 
season, never trailing at any 
time in a game. Marred only by 
off-the-field troubles - such 
as players breaking the law -
the Comhuskers havc had two 
undefeated seasons in a row. 

So, Nebraska, a state known 
for ... com, will now be known 
for football titles and housing 
criminals on their team. 

Criminals such as junior 
running back Lawrence 
Phillips, who pleaded guilty to 
charges of assaulting his 
former girlfriend earlier this 
season. Onl~ a couple month 
after his arrest, however, 
Phillips started in the To tito 
bowl and helped the 
Comhuskcr's to their second 
consecutive national crown. 

The university points tu its 
high graduation rate among 
its football players, as if that 
is justification alone. In 
addition, the athletic depart-
ment has blamed west coast 
recruits for the criminal 
element on the team. Frankly, 
I think the program should 
stop smoking their com and 
and start excepting some of 
the blame for their failure to 
keep the kids in line. 

I don't care how many 
players Coach Tom Osborne 
gradualeS each year, he needs 
to concentrate more on keeping 
his players out of jail- in the 
last three years, seven Ne-
brisica players have been 
arrested It one time or another 

Yet despite the inability of 
Husker players to stay out of 
the local clink. Nebraska 
football will undoubtedly 
remain a power because of the 
midwests' overabundance of 
large, com-fed, muscle-bound 
ogres who man the offensive 

- line. If he lIIys on track. 
Osborne may someday be able 
to display as many banners as 
mu,shob.

PORTS 
Tritons Claim 
'Classic'Title 
RIPPING: UCSD topped Ripon (WI) to cap its winter 
break with a win at the La Jolla Classic Tournament 

Jennifer Hart/GuardIan 

MYP: UCSD junior Matt Aune looks for two of his 29 
points during the Tritons ' upset of Ripon (WI). Aune also 
grabbed a tournament-record 33 rebounds in two games. 

By Mlk. Stan •• 
Staff Writer 

What a way to start the new year. 
Facing an undefeated team from Ripon 

College (WI), the UCSD men 's basket-
ball team came out fired up and notched 
agutsy,I04-97 victory in Saturday night's 
championship gameofthe La Jolla 
Classic. 

The Triton attack was spear-
headed by the stellar, all-around 
play of Tournament MVP Matt 
Aune. The junior center scored 29 
pointstogoalong with 15 rebounds, 
giving him a total of 33 boards in 
the two games, a new tournament 
record. 

"Ripon is an experienced team," Tri-
ton Head Coach Greg Lanthier said. "They 
shoot the ball very well. They took away 
our three-point shot - took away what 
we wanted to do - but they weren't able 
to handle us inside." 

While the Redmen may be a talented 
team, considered by some to be a Final 
Four favorite, they lacked the muscle to 
deal with Aune inside the paint. 

'They have a good team, but their 
inside players are mo tly fine~se play-
ers," Lanthier said. ''They don't have any 

inside power." 
Because of this inside scoring and 

rebounding, the Tritons controlled much 
of the first half, never trailing until Ripon 
pulled ahead, 31-29, with 7:00 remain-
ing. The lead changed hands several times, 
with UCSD taking it last advantage at 

the 2:00 mark on five consecutive 
points by freshman point guard 
Adam Libby. 

The Redmen, however, took a 
three-point advantage to the locker 
room at halftime, largely a result 
of their blistering 6 of 7 shooting 
from three-poi nt land. 

UCSD came back early in the 
second half, behind an 8-2 run which was 
spurred by Aune and freshman forward 
Mike Thimgan. Defensive adju tments 
and aggressive Triton play forced Ripon 
to work even harder for its points arterthe 
intermission. 

"Defensive ly, I feel wedidagoodjob 
in the second hal f," Lanthier said. 
"[Sophomore guard] Jason Jones did a 
good job of shutting down lRipon senior 
guard) Craig Smith; and we adjusted to 
[senior forward) Todd Fortune, who shot 
the ball extremely well in the first half."

UCSD Women Speed-o Toward NCAAs 
EIGHT IS ENOUGH: Triton women qualify 
eight swimmers for Nationals at Speedo Cup 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

As Doug Boyd, head coach of 
the Triton swimming team, would 
explain: The month of December is 

be posted. 

to swimming what 
the preseason is to the 
NFL. Namely, a 
warm-up in which the 
athletes to train hard 
and prepare for the 
meets later in the sea-
son when NCAA 
qualifying times can 

chool records. All of that during a 
"training" period. 

'That was the best meet we have 
ever had this early in the year," 
Boyd said. 

Is it any wonder that coach Boyd 
has high hopes for the remainder of 
his team's season? UCSD's incred-
ible performance at the Speedo Cup 
began with the seniors and carried 
right on through to the freshmen 
corps. 

However, for the UCSD 
women's swimming team, this De-
cember proved to be far more pro-
du::tive than winters past. 

Senior co-captain Carrie Parker 
began the onslaught by posting a 
school record (and NCAA quali-
fying mark) of 1 :54.65 in an event 
she normally doesn't specialize in, 
the 200-yard freestyle. Parker also 
qualified for the national champi-
onships in the 200 backstroke 
(2:08.10) and in the 100 freestyle 
(53.74).-

On the move: UCSD freshman Linda Monroe qualified for the 
NCAA champIonships in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke. 

'fhat was because at the Speedo 
Cup in Long Beach (Nov. 30-Dec. 
2) the Tritons qualified eight - yes 
eight - swimmers for the NCAA 
championships and broke three 

Junior Kristen Kemmer did not 
disappoint either, IS she notched 

lifetime bests - and NCAA quali-
fying standards- in the 200 bacJc-
stroke (2:10.61) and the 100 but-
terfly (I :00.5 I). Fellow junior 
Heather McPherson made her mark
