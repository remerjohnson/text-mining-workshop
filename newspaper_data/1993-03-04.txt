event. 

Desp ite concern voiced by sev-
eral audience members that the mea-
sure would givean unfairadvantage 
to wealthy candidates, Brown in-
si ted that his proposal was the best 
way to stop the "money chase" that 
is so prevalent in government and 
return political power to the major-

"This is a gradual transfomla-

Triton Yearbook Cancelled, Poor Sales To Blame 
Sheryl Wolcott 

Senior Staff Writer 
Citing diminishing ales, editors of the Triton 

Yearbook cancelled production of the campu -
wide annual and will provide refunds to tho e 
who already paid for a copy. 

"Hopefully. it won ' t be indefinite. but maybe 
for the next couple of year there will not be a 
campu -wide book," aid Co-Editor-in-Chief 
Kathlene Jen en. UCSD has produced a year-
book for the la t eight years. 

In place of a yearbook, Jensen said, the staff 
has decided to work on a "freshman record," a 
book that can be purcha ed by entering tudents 
which contains pictures of the entering clas and 
information nbout cumpu clubs, groups and er-
vice. 

In addition, according to Co-Editor-in-Chief 
Greg Gee, the taff is talking about putting to-
gether :l irnilar "senior record." with the senior 
taff and picture of UCSD events over the previ-

ous year. 

However, Gee aid, publishing a freshman 
record for next fall is the first priority, and as an 
"unfortunate side effect, there isn't really going 
10 be any sort of book for thi yeaL" 

Jensen attributed the cnllcellation to a pro 
gressive decline in yearbook sale over the last 
few years, which reached the point where the 
publi her could no longer afford the losses in-
curred.

IRIPS Graduate Students Publish Journal A.S. M EETING NOTES 
EaD: Publication focuses 
on connection between 
environment and economy 
By Dianne Hasselman 
Guardian Reporter 

Graduate students in the Interna-
tional Relations and Pacific Studies 
program at UCSD have just pub-
lished the second i sue of the JOllr-
f1al Of Ellvirollmelll & D evelop-
mew (E&D). E&D consists of ar-
ticles about the interdependent rela-
tionship between the intemational 
environment and economic devel-
opment policies. 

According to E&D Director of 
Publ ic Relations Meghan Steward, 
no other publication in the United 
States has uch a dual emphasis. 

Created last summer in response 
[0 the United Nations Conference 
on Environment and Deve lopment

that's pretty pathetic:' she aid. 

For this year's edi tion, the pub-
lisher required advunced sales of 
500 books in order to publ i 'h the 
book. By the end of fall quarter. 
only 50 books had been purchased. 
and Jensen said the staff did not 
think it could meet the 500 mini-
mum. 

"There have been several people 
that we've worked with in the A.S. 

in Rio de Janeiro, the E&D is the 
work of over 50 volunteer students. 

The majori ty of the anicles in the 
current publi a[ionof E& D respond 
to the current is ue surrounding the 
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment. Steward said that this is ue of 
the joumal focuses on Latin America 
and the possible effects the North 
American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFT A) may have on M exico.

"(The United State 1 ha done 
too much in Latin America, and if 
we're going down there. we can't

have to incorporate their cu lture. In

[publi hingl com pan lost about 
$ 15,000 on last year's book. 1 un-
derstand they can' t take losses like 
that." Gee said. 

Jensen aid a number of factor~ 
may have contributed to the declin-
ing sales. including in reusing stu-
dent fee increases which restricted 
tudents ' budgets. Last year's 200-

page publication cost $30. 
She also noted a "general apathy 

on this campus," and the possibil ity 
that students do not know that a 
campus-wide yearbook exists.

Co-op Negotlatlon..- A.S. President Mike Holmes discussed briefly the 
grievances the Graduate Student Association (GSA) has with the recently 
passed Co-op Memorandum of Understanding. The GSA does not believe 
it is necessary to void the agreement with the co-ops within five days If they 
fail to submit their yearly tax paperwork to the administration. The A.S. has 
also received a new draft of the memorandum from the co-ops and Holmes' 
understanding is that a new copy from the administration is forthcoming. 
"We are going ahead with our March 5 deadline for signing the memoranÂ· 
dum,Â· said Holmes. A special meeting of the A.S. may be called on Friday. 

UCB Legal SUlt- The administration has retained Deputy UC General 
Counsel Gary Morrison for the upcoming lawsuit flied by the University 
Center Board (UCB). Members of the Council expressed concern because 
it was Morrison's memo to Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Watson that prompted his disestablishment of the UCB last month. 

Affirmative Action Advisory Committee- A study by the UC Latino 
ElgibilityTask Force is underway to find ways to improve the representation 
of Latinos throughout the UC system. Members of the commmee plan to 
make the following recommendations to the chancellor: restructure the 
diSbursement of financial aid to meet the needs of the Latino community, 
make the information on fmancial aid, housing, and admissions more 
accessible to Latino students. allow English as a Second Language (ESL) 
courses to qualify for UC requirements, and develop a system-wide plan to 
address these issues. If these recommendations are implemented "they 
will help other minOrity groups as well as Latinos.Â· said Task Force member 
Veronica Murayama. 

Campus safety- Warren Senior Senator Sean DiThomas reported on part 
of 80 page report on campus safety. The report was compiled partly from 
a survey done by UCSD Police Officer AI Jenkins. "The survey showed that 
most of the crimes on campus are caused because students let them

National Service Program is 
The Right Kind of Change 

From the opening d<tys of his campaign through the fin.t munth 
of his admini~tration. Bill Clinton has talked about change. about 
rew rlonggovemmentto make it m re re~pon ~ive to the pe pic. For 
a while. allthi~ 'eemed like typi al election-year hype. But with the 
unveilingofhi\ "national service program" at Rutger~ Unive~ity on 
M nday, the president may have finally staned delivering on the oft-
repeated promise f change. 

nderClinlon 's proposal , college ~t udenl~ will be able to borrow 
money to pay for tuit ion from the federal govemment, provided that 
the money j~ paid ba k through community ,ervice r a payroll 
deduction after graduation. In the plan'~ first year, 25.000 ~tudent!> 
will be eligible to pani ipate in coml11unity . ervi e. growing to 
100.000 in four year. 

litics of the proposal may charge that this new national ~ervice 
program wi ll increase federal !>pending during a lime when the 
preident h uld be I king or ways loeliminate needle. !> expendi-
tures. But if any of the president' propo 'ab deserve to be funded. 
then the national service program is definitely one of them. The 
current sy tern of paying back college loans is a hambles. nderthe 
old program. hundreds of thousands of federally-guaranteed loan 
recipients have defaulted. With fees and tuition skyrocketing for 
many olleges and universities, more students. pani ularly tho e 
who are economically di advantaged, will have a difficull time 
meeting the rising costs of higher edu at ion. More than ever. the 
nation must develop a new program to meet the needs of these 
srudents. Clinton's program not only addre e uch need , it creates 
an innovative ystem which help the community as well. 

"We're gOiJlg to try to restructure the collcge loan program so that 
if peoplc want to serve over a long period of time. they won't be 
di scouraged from taking communilY service jobs just becau e they 
pay less." Clinton aid. The progmm will 'erve as an importanl 
encouragement for tudents to pay back their communi ty as police 
ofli er . tea hers and through other publ ic !>en 'ice jobs. Besides 
improving the community, this ponion of the plan w uld allow 
students a greater flexibility in financing their education. 

True. there are pi tfalls to Chnton .!> proposal. The high cmt of the 
program will no doubt fa estiffresistance in Congres . BUI themany 
long-teml benetit produced by linton's national 'ervice program 
-educated citizens and a stronger 'ommunity, to name two - far 
outweigh the inillal price tag. 

There i!> alway. the danger. as ~ome cri tics have sugge!>ted. that 
a government program. no mailer how noble its aims, will eventually 
become transfomled inro a bureau ratic nightmare. \ hilc thi ' IS 
ce rtainly to be guarded again t. it i. no reason to ignore an therwi 'e 
innov:lIive approach to commullIty service and college loans. 
Clinton's plan may be in its earl stage, but it sel'\es a\ an 
encouraging sign of a new approach that this admlllistmtion might 
take \\ hen addresslIlg the problems that face the nation. 

A Visit Full of Sound and 
Fury That Signified Nothing 

The verdi t is in on UC President Ja k Pelta on' vi ' it to C San 
Diego lasl week. Everyone from Â·tudent leaders to faculty members 
to the Guardiall editorial board eems to have reached the ame 
consensus - Peltason's pilgrimage toour canlpu was full of ound 
and fury. but in the end, signified nothing. 

The me ' age Peltason brought with him wa nothing new - the 
univer ity is in a grave financial crisis, the gravest in luding the 
Great Depression, as Pellason pointed out. But if the problem was 
nothing out of the ordinary, then 0 were the answer ' Peltason 
provided. TIlere was talk of fee hike , alary cu ts and administrative 
re~tructuring. but all of it was vague. For a man who will have to 
formulate some type of plan within the next month to meet the budget 
hortfall, Pelta on's ideas were urprisingly light 011 pecifics. 

Even more distressing was the president'S tendency to avoid 
di cu ing j ue pecific to UCSD. Whenever one of the e i sue 
w raised. Pelta on would defer to the "local" administration. This 
hands-off approach may be a convenient way to avoid addressing 
specific i sue , but it is hardly a nti fying re pon e. 

Pelta on' vi it to the campus was a nice idea during tres Â·rul 
time for the univer ity. It would have been even nicer if he had 
brought along specific answers to some very troubling questions.

THE TRUTH 
Is STRANGER 
THAN LYING 
&AlIRE: Only the best public 
relations weasel can keep up 
with the many clifferences 
between promises and reality 
By Sam Halpern 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Whatever else he is, President Climon is a 
man besieged. Five billion human beings are 
haranguing him. the most difficult of whom are 
his fellow citizens. Americans are an unreason-
able lot, taken to demanding absolute truth in a 
society who e very con titution was purposely 
designed to accommodate hedging. Indeed, the 
hedge is our national flower and has been since 
Patrick Henry demanded liberty or death and 
settled for a ~Iave-holding republic and an upper 
respiratory infection. 

Bill Clinton knows thi , and thus. he made 
his public relations per on. Mr. Sertain 
Stuffalottagas, available to the Gllardiall to 
"clarify" variou "misconceptions" of the goal 
and promi e of hi young admini tration. 

G,lardiall : Good afternoon, Mr. 
SlUffalottagas. 

Stuffalottagas: Good morning, gentlemen. 
Please. call me Stuff. 

Gllardian: Okay. I guess the main issues that 
our readers would like addres ed are the appar-
ent differences between the Clinton 
administration's campaign promises and .. . 

Stuff: Perceived promises. 
Gllardiall: Very well, perceived promi es 

and the real ity of ... 
Stuff: Perceived reality. 
Gllardiall : Alright. perceived reality of these 

promises. 
Stuff: Excellent question. There are none. 
Gllardian: Huh? Mr. Clinton said he was 

going to end gay discrimination in the military, 
request a middle-class tal( cut, make $60 billion 
available for work on the nation 's infrastruc-
ture, and cut the deficit in half in four years, 
while only rai ing taxe on the rich. 

Stuff: You people in the pre s are something 
else. We have never backed off on gays in the 
military. Ithasju t been pu hed back slightly by 
other priorities. We have a targeted start in '94. 

Guardian: Well, that's not too bad. One year 
isn't perfect, but it 's .. . 

Stuff: 2194. 
Guardian: That's ridiculous! That's over a 

hundred years from now. That's ... 
Stuff: One hundred years better than any-

body else has done and totally fulfills the 
president 's promise. 

Gllardian: Let's talk about the deficit. You 
said you were going to slice it in half in four 
years, now you're backing off. 

Stuff: Not the president 's fault. We talked to 
Bush, and he lied about the size of the deficit. 
We took him at his word. 

GllOrdian: How much did he say it was? 
Stuff: $82.61. 
Guardian: Mr. Stuffalonagas, an idiot would 

know that figure was wrong. 
Stuff: Careful-Mr. Bush may no longer be 

president, but he deserves your respect. 
Gllardian: Well ... what about the middle-

class tax cut? 
Stuff: That's been a non-issue since New 

Hampshire, but you guys are being so obnox-
ious about it, we will propose a middle-class tax 
cut of a little over 20 percent. 

Guardian: That's incredible! How can you 
run the country if you cut taxes on middle-class 
people by 20 percent? 

Stuff: Who said anything about people? 
We're talking about native American camels, 
aardvarks and kudzoo grass. 

Gllardian: There are no native camels and 
aardvarks. And kudzoo grass i vegetation! 

Stuff: That 's not the president'S fault. You 
want answers, you got to ask the right questions.

seems. we must first feel 
the effects of Bill

before people will look 
at the pecifics. And this 
plan is nO{ going to feel 
good. In fact, you'd bet-

Of course, we have heard inccss:ulIly from

great. d n't it? Clinton and the Democr.lls say 
they've gO{ a full hou~with this plan. It 's time to 
all their bluff and see what their ards really are. 

What the average citizen andespeciaUy cor-
pomtions like about Bill Clinton's plan is the 
possibility for pending cut~ and deficit reduc-
tion. Â£n hi plan, though, tax increases are masked 
as .. pending reductions," new spending pro-
grams are ostensibly linked to spending cuts and 
the much beleaguered taXpayer i oprimi tically 
and ignol1U1tly giving his support to a Congress 
that has failed 10 deliver even once on such 
promises to change its wasteful way . After 
looking at the specifics of the plan, it becomes 
clear that it i politics as usual in Washington. 

According to the Institute for Research on the 
Economi s of Taxation (IREl). among Bill 
Clinton 's "spending reductions" are at least 30 
revenue increases totalling $40 billion for the 
period from 1993 to 1997. Examples include: 

â¢ increasing the maximum portion of social 
security benefits subject to tax from 50 percent to 

8S percent 
â¢ fees for ,t k regbtnltion 
â¢ increased u,t 111, fees 
â¢ harbor tax incre~L-,c~

Bill Climon also ~aid he wants "to improv.:

again we see Bill Clinton's tempt illg rilctoric

COSts to bw,ines.-,cs implicit in Clinton\ plarl are 
clearly not healthy for the econ my. Among 
those"spendingcuts" are highertaXe.<. for mining

poration taXes. Apparently. we must relearn the 
painful eÂ»perience that higher taXes increase the 
cost of capit;iI and reduce the incentive 10 work.

A FIFTH VOICE SPEAKS UP FOR THURGOOD MARSHALL 
Editor: 

As provost of one of UCSD's two un-
named undergraduate colleges, I am writing in 
support of the proposal to name Third College 
after Thurgood Marshall. 

From the per pective of a college that has 
been seeking a name for more than two years, 
I want to stress the advantages of Thurgood 
Marshall 's name. For reasons too obvious to 
elaborate, it is appropriate 10 Third College's 
mission and philosophy. Moreover, the name 
carries a sense of dignity and respect that Third 
College alumni can be proud of when they 
leave UCSD. The present numerical designa-
tion of "Third College" is so nondescript as to 
make it almost meaningle s to employers, 
graduate schools, prospective students and the 
general public. 

Nor can 1 imagine that this name will 
generate significant opposition or hostility, an 
important considemtion as we are learning 
while seeking a name for Fifth College. 

While it should not be chosen solely be-
cause it is non-contentious, the fact is that 
many appropriate names cannot be considered 
because they are so controversial. It is an 
advantage that this is not the case with his 
name. 

There may be Third College students who 
want to retain the current name. since it is, after 
all, now more than two decades old. While 1 
understand this resistance to change (many 
students in Fifth College are also encouraging 
us not to change our name), I am convinced 
that a numerical designation for a college 
lacks the general appeal, the sense of identity 
and the name-recognition which a human 
name carries with it. 

The time has come for Third College to 
e tablish a clearer identity. In my opinion the 
name Thurgood Marshall is the right name. It 
works, both by it sound and what it tand for.

No 'Charges' Were Filed 
Editor: 

In Chri Jen en's article "Watson Misses 
Grievance Deadline" (Feb. 22). it wa re-
ported that Chri Burnett filed a grievance 
alleging that he was unfairly charged with 
occupation of the orth Conference Room 
and that the "charges" were subsequently 
dropped for lack of evidence. 

The fact i that "charge " were never 
broughtagainstMr. Bumett. and it is therefore 
incorrect to report that Ihey were ubsequently 

dropped. The report of the incidenl involving 
the North Conference Room W:l\ proces<,ed in 
accordance with procedures set forth in the 
UCSD Student Conduct Code resulting in the 
detennination that no "charge~" should be 
brought against him. Although the incident 
was properly proces ed, I have offered an 
apology to Mr. Burnett for any di~t ress or 
inconvenience he may have suffered a~ a 
result of that processing.

Democrat ic tradition. 

The i 'ue of gay in foreign mili-
laries is irrelevant and inapplicable. 
Mo t oflhecountries Mr. Harris men-
tions have mandatory ervice and 
con cription law . And none of them 
can hope to hold a candle to our 
fighting force. They are les effective, 
Ie. s capable and Ie important to 
overall security. While they protect 
individual intere b. the Uniled State 
prole lOurs and theirs. as well as 
freedom and democracy. 

The i ue f whether or nol the 
public should have a vOIce is absurd. 
Of course il hould, and in fact, it is 
exa tly becau eofthis that bla " . and 
Olherminoritie ' have their civil righls 
ensured, but nowhere at JOy time ha 
mililary service been a right. People 
are excluded because Ihe are too fat, 
too short. too low, not capable physi-
cally or mentally and for a host of 
other reasons. If they were not ex-
cluded. then lhe mililary would cease 
to be an effective force and would fall 
into di array and worthies ne . 

TIle next is ue is hardly worth 
discussing, but must be in this incred-
ibly na'ive tip-loe dance we are forced 

to do in order not 10 be culturally

have forgotlen that not too long ago 
Ameri ans of African de cem wanted 
to be called African-Americans. be-
fore that Afro-American, before that 
blacks and before any of those col-
ored. 

The line, of which Mr. HanisaskS, 
hould be drawn in uch cases a.s 
unu~ually close phy ' ical and p y ho-

breathe in closer proxim ity to each

One linal point I \'0 ish to make i

Mr. Hani .. only ~oughl to weal-en hi~ 
own case by demonstrating Ihe very 
dis riminatory practice~ he purports 
to be against. In his cheap shot at a 
very large segment of the country, 
Mr. Harri~ hows his own intolerance 
of groups with whom he disagrees 
after berating Ihe majority of the pub-
lic for disagreeing with the homo-
sexual or gay li festyle. This is typical 
of uch close-minded, one- ided 
thinking, to assert that certain ideals 
are good for one group. often in the 
mi norilY orcounter to the mainstream 
of American family values, but not 
for anyone else.

BROWN: 
Former Governor 
pu he refOIm 

JERRY BROWN: 'I'M NOT GOING AWAY' 
Contlnued from page 1 
Democrati pany, 

"You have a y 'lem where 
what you plot out is how many 
rich people [and] how many in-
lere t group can you go after," 
Brown said. 

"Even if you're not bribed, 
your whole mentality [focuses 
on] figuring out where are mil-
lion of d llars to be derived in 
Ihe mo t efficient way." 

De~pile Ihe focus on hi new 
initiat ive,lhediscussion c vered 
a broad nmge of issues. includ-
ing fee hikes in the UC system. 

"F rahundredyears.thi was 
a frt'e university," Brown said. 
" In 1980, Ihey said Ihey would 
[asse 's] ~ome nlOdest fees. TIley 
figured oul, ~mce students never 
prote ted. [that theycouldj keep 
increasing them and they will 
keep increasing them until they 
are $1 0,000 a year. " 

Brown urged student~ to la"e 
an a live role in opposing the fee 
increases and told them that they 
must be more "militanl" if they 
hope to accomplbh anything. 

Brown added that " the free-
dom of the student is being de-
stroyed by getting [ the students] 
in an indentured pattern of debt 
payment." 

Brown drew the loudest ap-
plause when he atlacked priori-
ties of the federal government. 

'There" omething weird 
going on when we pend billions 
of dollars fighting a collapsing 
empire." Brown said. "And on 
the real war, which is going to 
happen in our streets because of 
the despair and hostility happen-
ing along racial lines, they pend 
pennies."

News Editor Francisco DeVries and 
Opinion Editor Philip Michaels spoke 
with the former California governor 
and presidential candidate Jerry Brown 
on Monday, Brown was on campus 
promoting his new plan to reform 
campaign spending, 

Guardan: Just to .tart out, do you 
..... ..., opening comments on 
wiry you .. here? 
Brown: Well ... first of all just to tell 
people about our Â·We the People" 
organization. which is a membersh ip 
organization that is committed to both 
social justice and political reform . 
That's its basic thrust. and we are 
involved In commuillty organizing and 
political action .... I'm gOing to talk 
about the political system, the cam-
paign contnbutlOns and how that af-
fects public policy. whether It'S tuition 
or education or health care or military 
spending .... The political process IS 
rigged and biased to fa or those who 
pay for It. And in Californ ia we have the 
possibility for the initia ive to change 
that. 

Then this is the initiative you are 
sponsoring? 
What we're doing is basically seeing 
what level of interest there IS, and 
whether people will be interested In 
involving themselves. So we're see-
ing what's possible through the initia-
tIve as opposed to just candidacies. 
That's unique to California then, 
the Initiative process? 
About 20 states have it, so you make 
laws directly. 

Why would you start In California? 
Well, we're here and we helped pass 
an initiative in Washington D.C. where 
they proposed an $100 limit on the 
local. .. municipal campaign. 

So You',. basically contilMllng the 
themes from your campaip last 
year? 
Yeah, right. Why don't we just... give

the people a chance to express their 
views, answertheir questions, and I'd 
like to deal with students here. 

Why UCSD, why here? 
I'm going to San Diego, I'm going to 
Orange,l'mgoingto be up in Berkeley, 
San Jose State, so ... I'll be going 
those places. 

Is there something in particular 
about coil ... campu ... ? 
Because we're Circulating petitions 
and students can be a big part of that. 

Could it also be that college stu-
dents played a vital role In [Presi' 
dent) Clinton's election? 
Yeah, yeah, It 'S Important. I think 
given the big tUition Increases, there's 
gomg to be more student actIVIsm. I 
mean, eventually people are gOing to 
wake up and find out that students are 
not patsies In the whole process, 
they're bemg taxed, essentially ... to 
maintain other people's privileges. 

If you were in Go.ernor Wilson's 
shoes what would you work to do 
to ease the budget crisis, in the 
uc system and throughout the 
higher educatIon system? 
Well, they're Just going to have to get 
more out of It. Maybe they can ask to 
structure the teaching level or some-
thing .... There's a tremendous em-
phasis on research often to the detri-
ment of teaching and learning and 
that balance always has to be exam 
ined .. . I think the university will have 
to get more productive. there 'sJust no 
other choice. 

What impact might campaign fi-
nance reform hay. on the politIcal 
system, Including c1eaHng with the 
problems .......... s the budget 
crill. In Califomia? 
It just makes it a more valid system. 
Right now people running for office 
have to spend most of their time 
collecting money from the rich and the 
powerfuL .. that is not a democratic 
system. It's very undemocratic. it's 

SMOG $13* CHECK 

plutocratic ... and that 's not the way 
its supposed to be. It's unbalanced. 

Pr.sident Clinton's economic plan 
.... received a lot of support and 
a lot of resistance .... Can you elve 
some Impr .... on of hIs plan and 
also suggestions that you would 
make In tennl of changes? 
I th ink the plan has a long way to go . 
There are an awful lot of pieces that 
have to be explained more. During my 
campaign I suggested that the tax 
structure be simplified. and the Clinton 
plan is going to make it more compli-
cated, more loopholes, more brack-
ets that people will try to avoid. So I 
think we need a greater Simplicity, 
numb r one. I thmk the military can be 
cut more . I think Ihe Canadian system 
of health care probably makes more 
sens . I also think the national ser-
vice Idea wlJere you're going to be 
able to pay your college expenses by 
two years of national service, I don't 
know what happened to It. and that's 
really Important. That s supposed to 
be the centerpiece so I hope he puts 
that in there. 
(Cdltor's note: ThiS mterview took place 
the day before President Clinton un 
\eiled hiS NatlOllal Service Plan during 
a speec/l at Rutgers UniverSity.) 
Also during the speech, the presiÂ· 
dent talked about reform ... 
What? Campaign reform? Yeah, but 
he didn't specify. I want him to reduce 
contributions to $100, free teleVISion, 
free mailing, limit these campaigns 
and make them more rational. 

Do you think you had a lasting 
impact, in tenns of your '92 cam-
paign? 
I don 't know. that's why I'm still here. 
I'm not going away. We're going to 
make that impact, but you have to 
keep working at it. The basic issue, 
like inequality, that's not being dealt 
with yet. the basic assault on the 
environment. that 's not being dealt 
with , The black-white gap is getting 
worse. The trade treaty in Mexico is 

going to get rid of a lot of jobs that 
blue-collar people need. What is the 
answer to that. .. ? 
There ' s a false euphoria now. 
Everytx>dy'sfeelingwonderful, whether 
they 're poor or they're a corporate 
multiÂ·millionaire, whether they're a 
petro-chemical executive or a 
Greenpeace member .... You can't be 
all things to all people. You 've got to 
lay a line out. The difficulty with these 
elections was what was the line that 
was drawn? What did we get? We 
didn't get a middle-class tax cut .... 
That's why I have to continue workÂ· 
ing ... . Both parties are weighted down 
by the ir neeti to pander to the powerÂ· 
ful. .. . 

You mentioned that you still had a 
lot of work to do. Is this going to 
be mostly with the " We the 
People" organization? 
Yeah. and working With others. 

Doyouplantorunforofficeagain? 
I don't know. But right now, I'm not 
running for office. I'll be ou speaking 
and dOlllg some te levlsion. 

Do you S88 yourself as being able 
to influence the political trends in 
Washington rigllt now? 
Yeah. You want a shakeup because 
democracy is not working very well, 
It'S not happening nght now .. .. It's 
gettlllg hard to go to school, it's not 
getting easier. A lot of people losrng 
their Jobs .... What's going to change 
that? Now I want to see some really 
Interesting Initiatives, you know. more 
cooperatives. I want to see people 
who work In a business have some 
ownership in thai business ... . So right 
now we Signal that we don't like the 
Bush Reagan years. but where do we 
go from here is going to be qui e a 
struggle .... What I'm looking at is an 
alternative vision of politics and soci-
ety that takes into account the racial 
inequality, the environmental destrucÂ· 
tion, the changing nature of the world 
economy and the need for local power. 
That's the theme ....

Rugby Searching for Answers WHATZIT: Get me a bazooka 
the Olympics. TIle mascot for the 1996 
Allanta ganl will be. God help u . all, 
"Whatzil." Many scholars have specu-
lated on the exact origin of Whatzit -
a smurf gone horribly wrong, a night-
mare slug, even a human perm cell. 

By Brian K. Hutto 
Staff Wnler 

As the old but relevant adage goe , 
sometimes life just i~n't fair. UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Butler's ninlh and 
final season with the UCSD Triton 
rugby team i qui klydeveloping into 
his most disappointing yet. and more 
frustrating. for no particularly good 
rea on. UCSD' first ide remain. 
entrenched in the conference cellar, 
winles in six garnes. falling most 
recently to Arizona State and the Uni-
versity of Arizona, de pite >!rong pre-
sea on performan es. 

"We lost our captain and best 
player I ric Takeu hilto a career-
ending injury and no one has taken up 
the reins," Butler ~id. 'There i ~ a 

erious lack of passion for the game of 
rugby and everybody is just going 
through the motions. We are stuck in 
a losing vein right now and lack the 
mental discipline we need to suc-
ceed." 

Adding to Butler's di~tress i the 
fact that there i no apparent reason 
for the tearn 's udden tail pin. ''We 
haveanexperiencedteam [10 ingonly 
five tartersout of 15 from last year's 
squadl, very few injuriesandthe kill 
and fitne to get by, but there i a 
definite mental problem that has to be 
addre sed by each player. Some 
people have played brilliantly at times 
but are incon i tent."

has lit up the conference with a per-
fect6-0record . "Theirenthu i~m for 
the game is much higher and they will 
cenainly form the nucleu for next 
year's squad," Buller aid. 

Next year' team may not have to 
worry about the pressures of compet-
ing for high national mnkings or a 
hot at the national title. A deci ion i 

expected in May whether the team 
will remain at the more competitive 
univer ity level or drop down to the 
college level. 

In the meantime, the team i et-
ting its sights on winning its next 
conference game on March 13 against 
Long Beach State in Long Beach and 
thealways-cornpetitive60-team Santa 
Barbara Tournament April 3-4. 

Dave P~1er nou:hed four goal!. for 
the Tritons while Brent Rilsabeck led 
the UCSD attack with two goals and 
three ~ists. Goalie Jerome Vial had 
some early trouble but quickly made up 
for it. "It w~ tough for I ial] because 
the lights at the field made the ball 
dim ull 10 see. But h got over that and 
had a good game for us," leam captain 
Mark Steele said. 

The win follows a 13-9 defeat at the 
hands oftheAztecs last Saturday where 
the Tritons could do everything but 
score. "That game we played hard and 
lost, but for thi game the hard work 
really paid off," Steele said. 

ContInued from page 12 
ouLfit Now the trend is toward lovable, 
fl uffy mascots who look like Portugese 
theme park characters gone mad. And 
forthat reason, they must be terminated 
with extreme prejudice. 

For example, take the mascot the 
Padres introduced last year, an appall-
ing creation lovingly referred to as 
"Bluepper" [the Padres ignored my sug-
gestion to name it Â·That Hideous Blue 
Creature That Taunts Olildren'1-

Bluepper is a shapeless lumpofblue 
fur with a baseball for a nose. Essen-
tially, it re emble ome po t-
apocalyptical freakcome to wreak havoc 
upon atl unsuspect ing world TIle Pa-
dres expect this creature 10 emenain 
small children? o wonder theirteam is 
in sorry shape ... 

But the situation only get> worse. 
Ridiculous mascots are no longer con-
fined tothestadiumsofsecond-<livi ion 
baseball team . These horrifying fig-
ures are moving on to bigger games-

SOFTBAll. 
Continued from page 11 
double. then came home herselfon a hit 
by Shannon Banch. Banch was sacri-
fi ed to third before crossing the plate 
for the Tritons' third run of the game. 

But the Toreras roared back and, 
capitalizingonseveralkeyUCSDbreak-
downs, took control of the game. 

BUI Whatzit is upposed to be an 
anlbassador for intemational goodwill. 
Imagine a vi itor from Germany or 
Ru ia encoumering thi abomination. 
The odds are that they will return to their 
countries repulsed and launch their en-
tire nuclear arsenals at the United States 
to destroy Whatzit. And is that really 
what the Olympics are supposed to be 
about? 

So our duty is clear - we must rid 
the planet of every mascot from the 
Phillie Phanatic to the Phoenix Gorilla 
before it's too late. Oh, we'll give the 
mascots a two-month anll1esty period to

The second contest was pure frustra-

working. [O'Connor] pitched a good 
ganle, but we couldn't get the hits when 
we needed them. We had baserunners, 
we just left them on," Gerckens said.

added. "But when we were challenged

By Blair Ridley 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball team 
traveled aero town to play rival San 
Diego State University on Tuesday 
night. looking to avenge its 10 to the 
Aztecs earlier this year. TIle Tritons 
weredefeatedonceagain inthreestraight 
games. 15- 10, 15-3,15-9. 

Host SDSU (8-7, 5-4) was led by 
outside hitter Matt Knepper, who had a 
game-high 22 kills. He also added five 
blocks and five dig . Azteelohn Hyden 
was second on the team with 14 kills, 
one block and an impressive IS dig. 

TheTriton (O- 16,O-IO)wereledby 
Steve Kremser with 17 ki lis, one block 
and three digs. Mitchell Yap added 16 
kills, two blocks and three digs for the 
Tritons in a losing cause. 

UCSD looked strong in the first 

grune, compiling a team total 26 kill 
and a .352 kill percentage. SDSU,onthe 
other hand, besled the Tritons with 31 
kill and a.3 5 kill percenk1ge. 

The Aztee- poured it on in the sec-
ond game with 18 teanl kills and a .581 
percenUlge. 

The Tritons gathered just IS kills 
and a low . 243 percentage, resulting in 
orly tl1ree points scored. 

The third game was closer, with

DeLongchmnp caught up to it at the 
fence, but dropp..'d the ball. Abram~n 

ored and the Tritons took a 5-3 lead 
into the lOp of the ninth. 

But when Coyote Ja kie Jemp~on 
ripped Luhn;en 's delivery off the <1 -
foot sign in centerfield for a Ie:tdoff 
double, there was reason for concern. 
UCSD Head Coach Lyle Yates quickly 
replaced Luhrsen(8IP,4R, 3ER, IOH) 
with lefty Steve Height. After a deep 
hot to center for the ftrSt out, Height 

gave up back-to-back triples to pinch-
hiner Jason Krau and Jason Lyman 
and the game was tied. 

Yate then brought in Mark 
Hartmann. His first pitch was ripped 
into the left centerfield alley, giving tile 
Coyotes a tunning 6-5 lead heading 
into the bottom of the ninth. 

Normally a young team might not 
have handled the adversity of such a 
cMhing comeback. especially with the 
losses accumulating as they have for 
UCSD. BUI once again Yates' troops 
proved up to the task. Miyake took 
center stage in the bonom of the ninth, 
leading off with a base hit and stealing

Abramson grounded softly to second. 
advancing Miyake 10 third with two

That left the grune in the hands of 
Nahmias, or so it seemed. Facing David 
Ayala. Nahmias never had to swing the 
bat. As Ayala began his windup, Miyake 
(2 -5, 2 RBI. 3 SB) streaked forthe plate. 
slid under the tag and stole home. TIle 
play not only electrified the crowd and 
the Triton bench. but left the Coyotes 
stunned. 

" It was just instinct more than any-
thing," Miyake said. "We always have 
the green light to go if we think we can 
make it, so I jUM rJJ1 as hard as I could 
and yelled at the battertostep out of the 
way. When I saw the catcher drop the 

ball. it wa~ ju~t the greate.~t feeling." 
"It was I Miyake ' ~ I dec i~ ion to go. an

BEYOND: 
Ian Hammer 
provides the score 
Continued from page H1 

Beyond Ihe Mind' s Eye, a equelto 
1991 's Tile Mil/d's Eye. ha been on 
Billboard's Top Video and Top Laser 
Disc Sales charts for the past two 
month.. Direc ted by Michael 
Boyd tun,thefilmfeatu re mu iccom-
posed and performed by keyboardist 
Jan Hammer, who is famous for creat-
ing the Iheme song for " Miami Vice." 

Hammerisalsoarenownedse sion 
musician who has played with Jeff 
Beck. Neal Schon and Al Di Meola. 
His music accompanies each of the 10 
ShOl1 egment which make up the 
film. 

La t year, movies like Th e 
wlI'l/moll'er Mall and T erl/1illolO" 2: 
J udgll1e/ll Day included extensi vecom-
pUler graphic. In rhe case of Tile 
LoII'IIIIIOII 'a Mall, the graphics proved 
to be the most imere ting feature in a 
film that had acontrived plot and poor 
acting. Excerpts from some of the ' e 
graphics also appear in Beyolld. 

Butwhat makes Beyond interesting 
i the way it depicts a world of energy 
and movement wi thout any need for 
complex plot or drama - it's pure 
spectacle and makes for a thrilling and 
fascinating 45 minutes oftrippy graph-
ics and soothing synthesizer riffs. 

As the Max Headroom-like talking 
head says at the beginning of the film, 
" You are now entering a world ins ide 
the essence of your imagination. Look 
into your dre3l1ls, they can take you 
beyond the mind's eye." TIle opening 
equence catapults the viewerthrough 

twisling kaleidoscopes, swirling fun-
nel clouds and spiral galaxies. 

The first vignene, "Seeds of Life," 
computerizes the technique of time-
lapse photogmphy by showing the cre-
ation of a world of vegetation out of a 
wa teland over the course of a few 
minutes. First, seed pods soar through 
pace to land on a barren planet. 

The pods explode into mireo-pods 
which then sprout into a variety of 
plant ranging fromangularevergrcens 
to voluptuou lilies. In the end, seeds 
aredisseminatedeverywhereandeven-
wally pods are ejaculated back into 
OUler space. 

The short "Afternoon Adventure" 
begins with adepictionof a lazy, peace-
ful aftemoon at the pond. Fi h jump 
and dew drips off a leaf as a small bee 
floats unassumingly by. However, the 
cene of tranquility i hort-lived. 

When a larger bee happens upon a 
smaller one, a high-speed chase en-
s ues which would put most car-cha e 
scenes to shame. The bees are fo[ -
lowed as they whizz through the for-
est, making hair-pin turns and per-
fonning difficult maneuvers. 

The "Transformers ''- segment is 
s imilarly exciting. The popular toys 
come to life as they change from robot 
to race car to plane and fly through 
tunnels at dizzying speeds. If only the 
actual toys had such abilities. 

Not all of the shons are fast-paced, 
however. Picasso's paintings come to 
life in "Window ," and a computer-
generated couple discovers romance 
in "Nothing But Love." The merry-
go-round of sea horses and tigers that 
pin off into space in "Theater of 

Magic" are surreal images similar to 
omething Dali would have drawn. 

Beyond the Mil/d' s Eye hows the 
way a world more technically perfect 
than our own can be created through 
computer animation. Its world is both 
exquisite and exciting and depicts the 
potential of virtual reality, which may 
someday be the world we live in. 
Hyperreal. indeed.

'Mariachi' succeeds on a low budget 

Latin American filmmaker Robert Rodriguez managed to create his new film EI Mariachi on a shoestring 
$7,000 budget. Shot in two weeks in Acuna, 
Mexico (bordering Del Rio, Texas), Rodriguez 
worked with only one assistant and mo tly 
inexperienced actors to create a story which 
captures the de peration of a confused mu i-
ciano 

For financial reason , most cenes were 
shot in one take with a hand-held 16mm 
camera. Nevertheless, Rodriguez's effons 
result in a clever and simplistically-created, 
adventure-fi lled motion picture that is an ar-
tistic accompli hment despite the budget re-
straints. 

Rodriguez's strength i hi great ski ll for 
humorous storytelling. "Money has nothing 
to do with tellinga story," he said during a talk 
with hi s viewers at a creening at the 
Mandeville Audilorium. 

The story of EI Mariachi begins with the 
main character, referred to as EI Mariachi, 
played by Carlos Gallardo. A mariachi is one 
of a group of musicians which plays string 
in truments or trumpets. 

The young mu ician trie to make a living 

PholO coonesy 01 CoIurrbia Pictures 
Domino (Consuelo GOmez) is held 
hostage in EI Mariachi. 
in the hostile. arid town of Acuiia. when.' 
everyone seems to be involved in illegal ac-
tivities and not music. EI Mariachi 's career as 
a musician is put on hold after he is mistaken 
for an as as in and hunted down. 

Inexpl icably and relentlessly pursued, the 
confused musician ultimately ha~ no alterna-
tive butto fight back. In doing so, the character 
changes from a guitar-playing, romantic-ide-
alist 10 a guitar-playing, gun-fighting lover. 

In exploring hi character's nightmarish 
experience and transformation, Rodriguezdis-
tort Â· the meaning of the true mariachi. When 
a mariachi keyboard player i hired, he face 

the sad realization lhut technology is taking 
over in the world of music. 

Ironically, through hi s own pared-down 
production, Rodriguezdemonstrates what tech-
nology cannot replace in the film indu~try : 
skill, sense of humor, wit, will and a great 
story. 

Rodriguez denies that hi s film ~et Ollt with 
such a pUfJX'se: ' 'I'm just somebody who likes 
to make movie ." 

The recent winner of the Sundance Film 
Award, EI Mariachi not only has an amu~ing 
past "behind the scenes." but also a prombing 
future. Rodriguez plans to make EI M ariachi 
II, but with an enti rely new theme. 

Questions about production , . uch as 
whether to make it in English or keep it in 
Spanish with English subtitles, hiring profes-
sional actors or even substituting the prowgo-
niSI are sti ll debatable. 

Nevertheless, the film's success relies on 
it ability to show the struggle of an anist 
without sophisticated means of production. 

EI Mariachi is playing at the Hillcrest 
Cinemas and at selected theaters throughout 
San Diego.
