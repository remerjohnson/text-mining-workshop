GSA rescinds PC 
expansion bylaws 
Referendum will still 

run with same wording 
By MAlNmE FEDERIS 

Staff Writer 

The Graduate Student 
Association decided to rescind its 
approval for the Joint Associated 
Student Council and Graduate 
Student Association Special 
Elections Bylaws during a meet-
ing April 25. Due to the decision, 
the expansion fee referendum is 
currently to be run, with the 
wording approved by A.S. 
Council and GSA, without a set of 
bylaws. 

"This does not affect the 
University Centers Expansion 
Referendum from going forward 
since both groups approved the 
referendum al 0," said Univer ity 
Centers Expansion Task Force 
chair Garo Bournoutian. "Bylaws 
are not necessary to run a special 

election, although it would have 
been nice to have some," 

The GSA's repeal of its 
approval came after the bylaws 
were passed last week and ques-
tions of its constitutionality were 
brought up, The GSA meeting on 
April 25 was due to some uncer-
tainty about the hurried manner 
that the bylaws and some amend-
ments were passed . 

"Since we were up against a 
deadline to approve some bylaws to 
run the election, we decided to 
approve them the way they wen', 
and set an expiration date so that 
the bylaws will be reconsidered 
before they are used again," said 
UCETF GSA representative 
Andrew Cosand. 

Cosand said that the bylaws

A.S. ELEcnONS IN TURMOIL 

SF!'s appeal denied 
J~board will not hear dispute 

8y GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Judicial Board has 
dismissed the Students First! 
slate's appeal of the A.S. Election 
Committee's decision to disquali-
fy it from elections. Had the 
board decided to hear the case, 
hearings would have taken place 
to determine whether or not the 
elections committee had conduct-
ed a fair hearing. The slate's 
appeal had asked for a repeal of 
the committee's decision. The 
judicial board released its decision 
in writing on April 25. 

The judicial boare, which is 
comprised of representatives from 
tlle A.S. Council and each of the 
six colleges, voted 6-1 in favor of 
the dismissal. 

The written decision argued 
that the judicial board did not 
have jurisdiction over the case on 
the grounds made by the appeal, 
repeatedly stating that different 

claims made about procedural 
unfairness were irrelevant because 
objections were not made at the 
time of the hearing. 

Apellant Viviane Pourazary 
was unavailable for comment. 

"I'm disappointed, but at this 
point I've gone through all my 
emotions," said Harish 
Nandagopal, who ran for vice 
president finance on the 
Students First! slate. "I just don't 
see why we need a judicial board 
if they're not going td' question 
the authority of other commit-
tees." 

NandagopaJ, who is planning 
on applying for the currently 
vacant position of vice president 
external, said the decision did not 
come as a surprise. 

"I actually heard about it two 
days before," he said . "There 
were rumors, and by releasing 
the decision on a Friday it 
seemed like they were putting off 
bad news." 

The judicial board's written 
decision stated that it was not 
their responsibility to "question 
the wisdom of the decisions of the 
elections committee," explaining 
that the board concerned Itsel f 
only with the question of whether 
the committee acted within its 
authority. 

"Because there was no objec-
tion made, I felt there wasn 't any 
basis to hear the case," said Ryan 
Solow, the judicial board's 
Eleanor Roosevelt College rep-
resentative. "As much as I felt 
that the case needed to be heard, 
there was no sub tantial reason 
they presented us wi th to give us 
a reason to hear the appeal. It just 
lOOked to me like they were look-
ing for their case to be heard 
again." 

Among the complaints made 
by the slate in their appeal mclud-
ed failure of the defendants to be

Cos1a Rica conducted by UCSB geology pro-
fessor Phillip B. Cans, the Central Valley of 
Costa Rica will definitely experience major 
volcanic activity again. 

Gans has a laboratory that is known for 
its preciSion in dating volcanic rocks, which 
he did by USIn~ tile natural radioactive 
decay of potassium. Over several years, 
Gans collected and studied 450 samples 
from throughout Costa Rica and used that 
information to determine that subduction-
related volcanism in Costa Rica has been 
occurring for at least 24 million years. 

With the data he collected, Gans dis-
covered that major pyroclastic eruptions 
have occurred many times over the past 
million years in the vicinity of the Central 
Valley of Costa Rica, with the most recent 
about 324,000 years ago. 

The cities and towns of the Central 
Valley, including San Jose, the capital, are 
built on the vast pyroclastiC flow deposit 
that was produced by that eruption. If the 
same eruption were to occur today, within 
a matter of minutes to hours, the entire 
Central Valley and all of the major cities of 
Costa Rica would be overrun by a hot pyro-
clastic flow of ash and pumice. 

New vaccine delivery 
developed at Berkeley 
A Simple method of shuttling proteins 

Into cells via microscopIc polymer beads 
shows promise as a general way of carry-
ing vaccines or bits of DNA for gene ther-
apy, according to chemists at UC Berkeley 
and the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. 

Professor of chemistry Jean M. Fnkhet, 
with postdoctoral fellow Niren Murthy and 
their colleagues, designed a polymer that 
falls apart 10 acid to form thousands of little 
molecules that swell and explode the cell's 
digestive chamber before the acids have a 
chance to degrade the antigens contained 
In the polymer. I IS these antigens that 
stimulate an Immune attack against an 
Invading organism or a cancer. 

The technique avoids the problem simi-
lar methods have had, 10 which the cell's 
stomach aCids destroy the protein antigens 
before the Immune system can detect the 
presence of the foreign protein. The tech-
nique also skirts he disadvantages of 
today's Injectable vaCCines, which employ 
deactIVated VIrUSes to ferry antigens IOta the 
cellintenor 

The results of the study appear In the 
Apnl 21 early online edition of The 
Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Soences.

Career Services to 
switch to NACElink 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he UCSD Career Services 
Center will unveil a new Web-
based job listing system on May 6 
Ulat will allow employers to post 
job and internship opportunities 
for UCSD srudents and alumni 
free of charge. 

The Career Services Center. 
which currently uses the for-prof-
it job listing servi ce provider 
MonsterT RAK. will switch to 
NACElink. a new nonprofit ser-
vice provider run by the National 
Association of Colleges and 
Employers. 

T he new system will allow the 
Career Services Center to deal 
directly with area employers 
without going through third-
party commercial outlets and will 
greatly reduce the costs associat-
ed with recruiting student and 
alumni employees and interns for 
employers. 

NACE collaborated with the 
DirectEmployers Association, a 
nonprofit organization of corpo-
rations. and college career center 
directors from UCS D, UC 
Berkeley. UCLA. Yale University, 
University of Pennsylva nia. 
University of Florida and Florida 
State University. 

Accordi ng to Career crvices 
Center Director Nei l Murray. 

ACElink wa developed to off-
set the growing concern over the 
privacy of snldent data, the con-
stantly escalating cost employer 
are expected to pay to list job and 
internship posillons. concerns 
about losing school identity when 
using a commercial provider and 
the lack of stability offered by 
commercial providers. 

"Commercial lenders come 
and go, leaving all three parties 
- the employers, the school and 
the students - in a precariolls 
posi tion," Murray said. 

Twenty- even universities 
across the country launched 
NACElink in August 2002. The 
number of ca reer centers using 
NACElink will soon exceed 50, 
according to Murray. 

While NACElink directly 
benefi ts employers, it also helps 
students, who benefit from a 
wider array of jo!.J and internship 
opportunities offered, according 
to Murray. 

"We are already seeing the 
benefits of free service in that we 
are attracting employers that we 
wouldn't normally get." Murray 
said. 

The new system will be San 
Diego's largest free outlet for 
potential college employees. 
Students will be able to post 
resumes, access job listings and 
create job-search agents that will 
noti fy the srudent when a job that 
li ts his or her criteria becomes 
available. 

Employers can currently enter 
job and internship positions in the 
system at 
http://carm:llcsd.tdulrrclm:ruitm.sbt 
111/. Students and alumni will be able 
to access the information on May 6. 
Employers who wish to recruit stu-
dents and alwnni from several UI\I-
vcrsities may do so through the sys-
tem for a nominal fee. 

NACE was founded in 1956 as 
an informaoon source for college 
career service practItioners. It 
represents over 1,800 college 
career offices and over 1,900 
human relations and staffing 
group.

Appeal: 
Judicial board 
voted 6, 1 not 
to hear case 

continued from page I 
given the evidence a day before the 
hearing and the introduction of 
evidence not related to the viola-
tion report in the form of discus-
sion of the APSA-endorsed posters. 

The judicial board dismissed 
them for lack of formal objections 
at the time of their hearing. 

Other complaints were dis-
missed because the incidents in 
question were not prohibited by 
the election bylaws. These includ-
ed accusations of harassing reli-
gious questions by opposing coun-
sel Robert Forouzandeh, introduc-
tion of hearsay testimony and fail -
ure to follow precedent in its deci-
sion. 

"If they had appealed it differ-
ently. they could have mustered a 
hearing, but in the end there was 
nothing they could have done to 
win the case," Forouzandeh said. 

T he judicial boa rd 's written 
decision also argued that it was 
inappropriate for them to consid-
er elections results in their deci-
sion. 

"This appeal asks the judi ial 
board to embrace a 'might makes 
right' approach to elections." the 
written report stated. "This 
approach is repugnant to and 
incompatible with the idea of fair. 
democratic elections."

THE RACE

ADMISSIONS 
Focus on ethnicity masks the 
importance of socioeconomic

I t's easy to be encour-aged by the University of California's 2003-04 
freshman admit data if you 
believe, as many do, in the 
oft-championed value of 
an ethnically diverse uni-
versity. That the admitted 
class has the highest pro-
portion of underrepre-
sented minorities in years 
- higher, in fact, than 
were admitted in 1997, the 
last year affirmative action

keeping their pet issue at 
the forefront of public 
thought. On the other 
hand, socioeconomic and 
class issues are decidedly 
less sexy than race and eth-
nicity, and much more 
complicated to explain and 
understand. Class con-
sciousness is low in the 
United States, and individ-
uals are much more likely 
to identify as black, Latino, 
or Asian than they are 
upper-Iower-class or lower-
middle-c.lass, making race a 

much better issue with which to mobi lize voters. that a well-rounded education is complemented 
by exposure to people from as many racial and 
ethnic backgrounds as possible. 

Indeed, breaking down racial and ethnic 
stereotypes is something we should all encour-
age, and a diverse student body is one way to 
promote this. However, some university 
administrators and activists are overly focused 
on the goal of increasing diversity and have lost 
sight of the real charge set before them: mak-
ing sure that all Californians who are qualified 
for a UC education can get one, taking into 
account whatever barriers are between them 
and their goals. What is being ignored is that 
it's class, not race, that serves as the main bar-
rier to higher education. 

Race has long been one of the most powerful 
forces in U .S. politics 

- powerful in 
irs ability to 
alternately unite 
and divide 
groups of 

Americans. 
Countless 
political 
personalities 
make their 
name known 
by trading 
on race, and 

they have 
a clear 

stake in

But it's income and social standing that 
determine where a family lives and thus what 
schools their children will attend - and it's 
hard to argue that it's the quality of one's K-12 
education that determines the likelihood of 
attending college. High schools in low- income 
areas are dramatically less likely to offer 
advanced placement courses, a key factor in 
competitive university admissions. Students 
who have to worlc during high school have less 
time to study than their more well-off counter-
parts, and don't have opportunities to pursue 
application-padding extracurricular activities. 

It's true that Californians on the lower end of 
the socioeconomic spectrum are disproportion-
ately minorities: About 22 percent each of 
American Indians, blacks and Latinos live below 
the poverty line; about 13 percent of Asians do; 
and about 8 percent of whites do. However, this 
association does not necessarily show causation. 
Few would argue that some inborn quality in 
nonwhite racial and ethnic groups destines them 
to poverty, and institutional racism has largely 
disappeared over the last forty years. The simple 
truth is that tho c who are born into socioeco-
nomic disadvantage are extremely likely to stay 
in it, regardless of their skin color - unle s their 

hurdles are understood, accounted for and 
correctly targeted for correction. 

An interesting situation with regard 
to race, class and educaoon I emerg-
ing in California's demographic. 

Currently, non-Latino whites hold 
a shrinking plurality in California's 
population at 46.7 percent, with 
Latinos' share having grown to 
32.4 percent in the 2000 census. Ln 
fact, Californians of lli panic or 

Latino descent are predict-
ed to outnumber non-
Latino whites by 2015. 
When that happen , 

Latinos will no longer be a 
minority - but will almo t cer-

tainly still have hurdles to overcome, 
such as frequently spealong English 
as a second language, generally work-
ing lower-paying jobs, and livmg in 
neighborhoods with underperform-
ing schools. In such a case, it will 
become clear that it is not Latinos' 
status as an ethnic minority that is to 
blame for the group's underrepresen-
tation in higher education, but rather 
the social and economic conditions 

that are common in that COIl\ -
munity. The difference is crucial 

in understa nding the issue of 
improving educationa l accessibility to 
California students. 

Referring to certain groups as "under-
represented" implies that there eXIsts a 
certa in level of acceptable representation, 
and the currenr numbers fall short of that 
- and furthermore, that acccptdble level of 
representation lying in the administrator;' 
mmds is tantamount to an abstract sort of 

quota . While such a quasI-quota i not eon-
~idered technically unconstitutional, it IS cer-
tainly contrary to the spIrit of the law If not 
the letter. 

The busmess of the university should not 
be meeting quotas, be they rigid or nebulous, 
but in tead provide the beSt poSSible education 
(0 the most qualified tudents. SometJme~ the 
mo t qualified students don't sport 4.3 PAs or 
1500 SAT scores, but do display hard work, 
commitment and talent by having overcome 

education~1 di advantages and societal barriers; 
md admissions programs that recognize this, 
uch as comprehen Ive review, Qrc good ones. 

But unul we divest ourselves of the notion that 
race is the barrier with which we must chIefly 
concern our elves, we will continue ro sell 
California's students and California's future, 
short.

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Sigma ,Chi responds to 

flyer Issue coverage 
E d itor: 

I find it necessary to respond 
to your coverage of last week's 
horrendous prank, involving post-
ed images of hate with the letters 
of my fraternity on those images. 
As one of everal Jewish members 
of the UCSD chapter of Sigma 
Chi, I have experienced first hand 
the warm hospitality and welcome 
shown to all members and guests, 
regardless of religion, nationality, 
race or sc)(ual orientation. 

The founding of Sigma Chi 
by seven students at the Miami 
University of Ohio in 1855 was 
an outgrowth of their desire to 
perpctuate the ideals of true 
friendship, equal justice and the 
fulfillment of learning. Although 
this vision of Sigma Chi was 
based upon the notion of shared 
ideals, they believed that true 
brotherhood would thrive best 
among men of different tempera-
ments, talents and convictions. 
They further believed tha t gen-
uine friendship could be main-
tained without surrendering the 
principle of individuality or sacri-
ficing onc's personal judgment. 

Your coverage of this shameful 
incident entirely fails to show the 
genuinely positive impact our 
organization has on this campus. In 
fact, your articles have actually per-
petuated the loathsome message of 
the prallksters by your posting of a 
copy of the actual flyer in the 
paper. A reproduction of the flyer 
itself should never have been print-
ed. It only served to give those who 
littered our community with such a 
hateful message a n~w campuswide 
forun) they did not deserve. 

This Incident is certainly news-

worthy and one warranting an 
honest, open discussion, but 
Sigma Chi should have been 
allowed a voice in this discussion. 
You have not interviewed even a 
single one of our 80-plus members 
and pledges. If you had, you would 
understand we are tru ly shocked 
and saddened that anything like 
this could happen on our campus 
and outraged that those who did it 
sought to associate us with such a 
reprehensible message. 

1 honestly do not know what 
the intentions of the people who 
posted the flyer on campus werc. 
1 truly hope it was intended as a 
meaningless, tasteless prank, not 
a defaming, discrediting one. 
The message of the flyer is in 
stark contrast to everything for 
which Sigma Chi stands. I know r 
speak for all members of Sigma 
Chi at UCSD in stating unequiv-
ocally that we had nothing to do 
with this terrible incident, and we 
are ready to do whatever it takes 
to ensure that our campus grows 
stronger and more tolerant in the 
days ahead. If anyone would like 
to learn more about the aims and 
activities of Sigma Chi, plea e 
visit http://www.sigmac/i1.org or

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Caffeine dispensing like drug dealing 

pe~'s-eye 
view 
Sam Wilson 

T hree in the afternoon and three espressos later and still I'm barely able to do simple 
addition. Caught under a caffeine 
landslide, my potassium levels are 
low, and I'm nose-diving into a shit 
fit. A million tiny rhinos are mak-
ing nests in my hypothalamus. 

In sales, effect is everything. 
Customers are like traffic: they 
don't care what mood you're in, but 
if you're angry when you get into 
the car you're guaranteed to be 
confronted by conspiracy-level 
incompetence when you get out on 
the road. The moment you stop 
smiling, the normal rotating cast of 
whimsical strangers deteriorates 
into a horde of litigious yuppies, 
hung-over shoegazers, menopausal 
vampires and sycophantic coffee 
groupies. 

There's nothing more pathetic 
than a super senior living off 
daddy's alimony and skipping lec-
ture to beg for drugs. Especially 
when he needs a white chocolate 
cut. It's like a panhandler with a 
sign saying "small bills only." I hate 
being made to feel like a drug deal-
er. I'm not a drug dealer! Drug 
dealers make commission. 

Meanwhile, there~ a line of snort-
ing half-caf blended mochas snaking 
in frOnt of my stand, no bathroom 
break In sight and all is not quiet on 
the Southern Front. I'm not a happy 
camper, even by the tandards of a 
refugee camp (and I'm not talking 
about UC Riverside). It's hard to 
microwave reconstituted chicken 
soup for the soul when you've just 

drank one apiece of the (euphemisti-
cally renamed) Afterburner and 
Blackhole, and you're oying to 
explain to someone why you're 
absolutely sure that the chamomile 
lemon tea has no caffeine even 
though it doesn't say decaffeinat-
ed. "You can't squee7.e blood from a 
stone," I explain. "Saying chamomile 
tea is decaffeinated is like saying that 
Ben Ameck~ acting has deteriorated." 

At this point, I learn JUSt how 
much I hate this customer. Not 
only is she one of those chronically 
energetic decaf people that brings 
their own "organic" sugar-free 
sweetener packets, but she's one of 
those mentally contaminated 
media slaves that seem to permeate 
my generation. 

First of all, I have a problem 
relating with anyone who would go 

. out of their way to avoid as perfect-
ly mild a sacrament as caffeine. You 
see, I'm mostly Scottish, of a low-
land clan. My lineage is more 
"Trainspotting" than "Braveheart." 
As long as the blackouts are man-
ageable, cook me up a double. 

But more to the point, why are 
so many people obsessed with 
actors) Why is the ability to act like 
a substandard version of someone 
else so valuable? The exception is 
Ronald Reagan, who actually was 
president. Acting is not a special 
skill, it's every job in America . You 
wake up, go in to work and pretend 
that you want to be there, and if 
you're really good, your boss pre-
tends that you aren't replaceable. 

Speaking of acting in bad faith, 
I'm sure all of you seniors remem-
ber the "I agree with Mich3el" pro-
paganda campaign from freshman 
year. For all of you who missed it, 
three years ago the Campus 
Crusade for Christ rented out 
advertising space in a Monday 
Guardian telling the story of their 

:~ 
. ~o. s..,.."" 

'12a!!! ..... 
, ",. p 

• ~sonn., St.'f 

young prodigy, Michael. 
Apparently, when Michael first 

came to college, he started doubting 
some of his religious convictions, 
but he redoubled his efforts and 
reaffirmed his beliefs, ensuring sal-
vation. During that week, people 
started wearing blue shirts that said 
"I agree with Michael," and by 
Thursday it seemed like half the 
people in my c1asse were wearing 
these shirts. The week's climax came 
when Michael himself emerged 
from seclusion to speak at Price 
Center. 1 went expecting a brilliant 
ideologue, but apparently The 
Crusade had decided to play up on 
the repressed sexuality angle and 
chose some half-speed blonde surf-
stud to deliver The Word. There 
was even a Ecumenical Escort 
Service you could call, and Michael 
would drive out and make you a 
chamomile tea. 

The infinite life shin campaign 
is the most vociferous religious 
recruitment movement I've seen 
since. It makes sense to schedule 
such a eampaign in spring, since the 
skimpy warm weather outfits breed 
plenty of impure thoughts ripe for 
triggering compensatory guilt reac-
tions. It also makes sense that col-
lege is such a popular time for 
recruitment, since most religions 
make your whole life look like col-
lege, getting ready for graduation. 

Picking a religion is like picking a 
major, and heaven is the job you get 
when you graduate. 
Fundamentalism is like bioengineer-
ing: It's a lot of work, and you have 
to give up on a lot of good time, but 
you feel pretty darn sure that you'll 
have a great job right out of school. 
But I'm a p ychology major, Jnd 
when I die and walk up to the recep-
tion desk in limbo, the secretary will 
probably ask me "So, what Jre you 
doing for grad school, anyway)"

Letters: Ads were not anti .. Palestinian 
continued from page 5 

ads beca use they were "purely 
offensive" and "i ncite negativi ty" 
was based on fa lse as umptions. 

T he news article in last week's 
G1Iardian (April 14) provided no 
explanation as to how the ads were 
not true or "anti-Palestinian." It 
pre en ted the perspect ive of 
Snldent For Justice with no alter-
Ilative o pinions of other campus 
organizations, which is typically 
required in a news article. 

The ads were discontinued solely 
on the subjective claims of one orga-
ni7.1tion and one letter to the editOr. 
On the other hand, the ads backed 
their claims ,vith well-cited fact. 

One ad showed some 
Palestinians celebrating the Sept. 11 
attacks. This is a fact: "Thou ands 
ofPalcstinians in the "Vest Bank and 
Ga73 trip cheered the attack ... " 
(Washington Post ept. 12,200 1). 

Another displays a Palestinian 
child' hero as a suicide bomber 
next to an Israeli child's hero as an 
athlete. Below the suici de bomber 
are the words "68 percen t of 
Palestinians approve of suicide 
bombing." T his roo is document-
ed. Look at the London Gllardia'l 
from June 21, 2002 as well as the 
Associated Pres poll found at 
hrrp:llap.lbo.rumlaplbrtakmgIMGAO 
1711DYQC.bmll. 

Admittedly, the idea of a mur-
derer as a child's role model is horri-
fying, and one's gut reaction is to 
deny that uch a thing could be true. 

Yet it is true. 
All around the world. 
ee http://www.operationsrrk.rom. 

The ad do not generalize or 
make global claims about individual 
Palestinian. The ads call attention 
to Palestmian rehglous and secular 
leaders who promote uicide 
bombers a role models fo r their 
children. The ads call altention to a 
ociety where children are taught to 

look up ro murderer as heroes. 
Why hasn't the religiOUS leader-

ship Issued a fatwa (religious edict) 
condem ning these actions? 

Where are the Palestinian voic-
es condemning these homiCidal 
actions on moral grounds' "Vhy 
does more than half of the 
Palestinian population support ui-
cide bombi ngs, according to 
htTp://www.ptarmrrw.org? 

Perhaps it is because instead of 

being seen as a public disgrace, 
homicide bombers are honored as 
heroes with publ ic squares, streets 
and soccer tournanients named 
after them (according to Tbr rw 
York Doily Nrwr, Apri l 22, 1998) or 
because "Gaza children are influ-
enced by the schools, the mosques 
or gatherings attended by many 
children where praise fo r sacrifi ce 
and martyrdom is voiced" (accord -
ing to bttp:IIwww.7IIrml1.org). 

Every society has Its Bowers and 
its weeds. In what ways has 
Palestinian society taken steps to 
uproot its weeds? 

Consider the father of a Jihad 
murderer from an Arabic language 
newspaper: "By whal right do these 
leaders send the young people in 
the flower of their youth to their 
deaths? Who gave them religious or 
any legitimacy to tempt our chil-
dren and urge them to their deaths? 
Yes, I say 'death' not 'martyrdom'" 
(from http://www.7IIrmri.org). 

All of us who wish to end this 
violence should assist th ose in 
Palestinian society wishing to speak 
out. T he Campustruth .org ads 
merely point out that it is the flow-
ers of Palestinia n society that arc 
being rooted out, not the weeds. 

These ads encourage all of u to 
take action to stop this incitement 
of violence so that Palestinians and 
Israeli children can grow up to be 
po itive, contribming members of 
their respective societies. 

In the future, 1 look forward to 
more balanced advertising and edi-
torial policies.

Bias against Watts not 
revealed in article 

Editor: 
I am concerned tha t the 

Guordlan article entitled "Y\'arren 
Colleges preSident-elect DQ'd" did 
nOt accurately portray the eAtreme 
injustice of the pril 16 trial or the 
motivations of the complainant. 

The judicial board was biased 
specifically because one of its mem-
bers had campaigned activcly against 
Watts during the 
election. Furthermore, her 
boyfriend had allegedly threatened 
WattS' counsel to "stay off my rurf." 

This member of the Warren College 
Judicial Board was in a position to be 
compelled by Watt 's detractors to 
rule against him. She never shOlJd 
have been allowed to adjudicate this 
case; however, although the judicia l 
boa rd chai r was made aware of her 
sta tus prior to the trial, she was not 
removed from the board. 

In addition, the refusal of rvstal 
Kitamura to give Daniel WattS the 
evidence against him 24 hours in 
advance was utterly abhorrent. The 
article fai ls to mention that the evi-
dence was able to be received from a 
reluctalll Kitamura just th ree hour 
before tile hearing and included 
about two hours of video footage 
that Watts had to sift til rough. In 
fact, because WattS' COIU1Sc\ had a 
class to attend before the hearing, 
the late receipt prevented him fi-om 
viewing the footage al together. By 
admitting th is ill egal evidence, the 
judicia l board denied Daniel Watts 
his right to a fair trial by denying 
him the time to prepare any art of 
a ppropria te defense. 

AI 0, this artic le refers to 
Kitam ura on ly as a student. It 
should be pomled out that 
Kitamura IS also a member of the 
Warren College Residential Life 
staff. he filed thiS gnevance at the 
suggestion of Warren College 
Resident Dean Claire Palmer, her 
boss. lai re Palmer also acted as a 
witncss fo r the prosecurion at this 
trial where she openly admmcd tu 
encouraging Kitamura to explore 
the election bylaws [or a violation 
by Watts. The Warren Residential 
Life office has overtly expressed its 
dista.te for \,\fatts ever since he 
voiced his opinion that they u~ed 
illegal interrogation techniques in 
the G1Iordioll during the R.A firings 
If1 October of last year. This IS an 
unusua l example of the administra-
tion meddling in the affairs of the 
student body. It seems that having 
admlllistration on her side in thiS 
hearing gave Kitamura unfair lever-
age tllat Watts couJdn't hope to 
cOlllpete wilh. This article made 
the heating ~ound as though it were 
business a usual when 111 facr It was 
nor. Watts' rights were shamelc ' Iy 
trampled and l\iwITIuras mOlivcs 
are Iughly suspect.

Expansion: Petition for 
'student control' circulated 

Clery mistakes correded at UC 
contin~d from page I expansion fee referendum. T he 

boa rd , which would have been 
made up e ntire ly o f stude nts, 
would run and mai ntain the cur-
rent University Centers fac il ities, 
and plan and build fu ture facil i-
ties . Proponen ts for a SFB say t hat 
about 2,000 s ign atures have 
already been collected. 

D.O.E.: Police errors in reporting rectified 
tha t the GSA had o r igi nall y 
passed confl ict wi th its consti tu-
tion . Cosand sa id that, according 
to the GSA constitution , a quo-
rum and majo rity o f graduate stu-
dents are required for a ball ot 
measure to be binding. Cosand 
said he found the bylaws to be 
inconsistent with the constitution 
because it wo uld have allowed a 
measure to be binding according 
to a campuswide quorum and 
majority. 

"Rather than have the referen-
dum go to a vote under question-
able bylaws and possibly cause legal 
problems later, we decided to let it 
run as a normal and not an 
A.S./GSA election," Cosand said. 

The GSA has also created a new 
task force, which will look into the 
bylaws for future use. The task 
force mcludes three GSA represen-
tatives and will also be extended to 
three A.S. representatives. 

"The purpose of the task force 
is to talee a look at the bylaws and 
see what would be required to 
make it OK with the constitution 
so that it would be approved," said 
GSA Vice President for Finance 
Lee Lovejoy. 

One of the amendments that 
were originally added into the 
bylaws required 15 percent of 
undergraduates and graduates to 
sign a petition if students wanted to 
add to the referendum. 

However, because the amend-
ments cannot be applied to the 
upcoming referendum, it is unclear 
whether students will be able to 
turn in such a petition in order to 
add to the referendum. 

One petition that has been in 
circ ulation is for the addition of a 
Student Facilities Board to the 

T hurgood Marshall College 
senior Diana Schwartz is one stu-
dent who supports the petition and 
expressed concern about who 
would control the fees. 

"People have alwa~ had con-
tentions with the fee referendum 
because they don 't give students 
autonomy," Schwartz said. "[The 
petition is] a call for student control 
and nOt about the amount of 
mo ney but who has authority 
regarding it." 

The petition would have also 
called for all student fees previous-
ly collected by the University 
C enters Advisory Board and all 
rent income it generates to be 
directed to the new board . 

However, University Centers 
Director Gary Ratcliff expressed 
concerns about such a petition. 

"There ar e issues of governance 
that haven't been looked at careful-
ly," Ratcliff said. " It seems that the 
pros and cons of various approach-
es weren't considered." 

According to Lovejoy, it is cur-
rently not a part of the constitu-
tion to have a law where students 
could add to a ballot through a 
petition. 

"Graduate students who feel 
that the GSA should take some 
action or who are concerned 
about a particular issue should 
speak with the ir department rep-
resentative or one of the G SA 
exec utives," Lovejoy said.

In a recent report, the U.S. 
D epartment of Education verified 
that discrepancies in the University 
o f Californi a's crime repo rting 
methods have been recti fied. 

The report marked the conclu-
sion of a two-year investigation of 
the UC system 's procedures in 
reporting crimes. Specificall y, 
crime-reporting practices at 
UCSD, UCLA and UC Davis 
were audited for the year 2000. 

The only complaint aimed 
d irectly at UCSD was the campus' 
classifi cation of sexual -assault 
crimes under the broad category 
of "physical abuse." This led to 
the exclusion of sex-related cr imes 
from annual campus crime reports 
that are federally required by the 
Clery Act. 

Confusion about the sources of 
crime statistics also contributed to 
the underreporting of sexual-
assault cr imes. The Clery Act 
requires that crimes occurring at 
off-campus sites such as fi-aternity 
houses and medical centers must 
be included in annual reports. In 
many cases, such statistics were 
not included or even gathered in 
the first place. 

Since the audit, UCSD has 
specified its definitions of differ-
ent crimes as to comply with 
Clery Act definitions. Recent 
reports now also include statistics 
collected from other sources, 
including counselors and coaches, 
in addition to those compiled by 
the pol ice department.

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How .. Educatlo. In--.nts different frDIII • loal? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage 
of future income for a fixed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

QuestIon: Can til ... Education Investments pay for all of my tuition? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need without the 
debt burden. REEF will pay upto $7000 to UCSD on your behalf. 

Question: How does this aff,ct IIJ Fllllcla' Aid pack .. ,? 

the President, confirmed that all 
UC schools have rectified crime 
reporting methodolo!,'Y. 

"UC and the Department of 
Educatlon are now in sync in thei r 
interpretations of the Clcry Act," 
McFadden said. 

Accordi ng to UCSD Police' 
Sgt. Bob J ones, such issues wi th 
crime reporting resulted primarily 
from confusion about the law, since 
the definitions of certa in cri mes dif-
fer between the state of California, 
the FBI and the C lery Act. 

" We can only report that 
which is reported to US , " 
- SJl Bob Jones, UCSD Police 

McFadden confirmed the 
complex nature of the statute. 

"The Clery Act is an extremely 
complicated federal law," he said. 
"It's subject to many interpreta-
tions. " 

Jones, who compiles UCSD's 
Clery report every year, also 
emphasized that even with better 
compliance with Clery Reports, 
there is still room for improve-
ment. One problem with the cur-
rent Clery process, he said, is the 
intrinsic limit to the St2tistics the 
Clery report can malee public. 

"We can only repo" that which 
is reported to us," Jones said. 

He further noted that the law 
itself is still "a work in progress." 

Jones cited the fact that 
because Clery crime defini tions 

differ from those of the UC 
police departments, certain 
crimes tha t are reported to the 
department are not included in 
Clery statistics. In 200 I, for 
example, five hate crimes were 
reported to UCSD , but only one 
of those met Clery's definition of 
a hate crime. 

Moreover, certai n alcohol-
related crimes like drunkenness in 
public and driving under the 
influence are not reportable under 
the Clery Act. 

"Th is docu ment has no t 
achieved its ultimate value yet," 
Jones said. 

Problems wi th how crime sta-
tistics should be collected, classi-
fied and repo rted were first 
brought up in 2000 when the 
SIlcrammto Bu exposed deficien-
cies in sexual assaul ts reported by 
UC Davis and other UC schools. 
In addition to criticizing schools 
for miscategorizing crimes and 
fa il ing to compile detai led statis-
tics, the newspaper also accused 
UC campuses of pu rposefull y 
omitti ng sta tistics to avoid tarnish-
ing their Image. 

Secur ity on Campus Inc., a 
nonprofit watchdog organization, 
consequently filed a complaint 
with the Department of Education 
regarding the Bu's allegations. 

Connie and Howard Clery lob-
bied for the Clery Act after their 
daughter, Jeanne Clery, was raped 
and murdered in her dorm room at 
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania 
in 1986. The law was passed in 
1990 and the Clerys have since 
mo nitored nationwide compliance 
with it by establ ishing Security on 
Campus Inc. 

. Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 
REEF wor~ closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to en~ure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you now 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay.

Salk: Child care, wellness center to be built 
continued from page I 

tute's current facilities. Under 
public pressure, the institute 
placed the plan on hold in 
February. 

One of the opponents ' main 
concerns is that the city has cate-
gorized the proposed develop-
ment as one that does not require 
publtc hearings or an environ-
mental impact study. 

"TIllS project must not lide 
through the city'S approval 
process without public input ~lnd 
before a full environmental study 
can be completed," said Kathryn 
Burron, chair of Friends of Salk 
Coastal Canyon. 

In addition to offiCial repre-
sentatives of environmental 
groups, about 10 people carried 
signs protesting the proposed 
development. One protester car-
ried a large photograph of the 
bluff with red arrows pointing to 
the proposed site of the child-<are 
and well ness center. 

The Salk Institute has formed 
an internal committee to review 
the existing development plans 
and suggest changes as deemed 
necessary. According to Bradford, 
the committee will not reach a 
final decision on the project for at 
least two months. 

Burton and others pointed to 

other locations on the Salk cam-
pus where the proposed facility 
could be bui lt. Also raised by pro-
testers was the possibility of a col-
laboration between UCSD and 
the institute to meet child-care 
and athletic needs. 

Taylor Hungerford, a senior 
at UCSD and co- founder of 
Students for Salk Coastal 

" Any development tl1Llt we propose ... UJOUld be 
optimally designed to 
preserve coostal bluffs 

and canyons, II 
- Robert Bradford, Salk Institute 

Canyon, pointed out that the 
land that the institute owns was 
given by the city following a 1963 
referendum. 

"The public gave [the insti-
tute] the land and it should be the 
public's decision for whether they 
should build or not and to make 
sure they do the environmental 
report," he said. 

Two pairs of gnatcatchers, a 
small bird that is on the threat-
ened species list, have been previ-
ously sighted ·in the vicinity of 
the project area. In addition, the 
coastal sagrebrush is prime 
breeding habitat for the gnat-
catcher. 

"The Salk Institute is an envi-
ronmentally responsible organiza-
tion," Bradford aid. "In keeping 
with the founding principles and 
vision of Dr. Jonas Salk and the 
architect Louis Kahn, any devel -
opment that we propose at the 
institute would be optimally 
designed to preserve coastal bluffs 
and canyons. That's fundamental 
to what we 're about." 

The current Salk Institute 
building was designed by famed 
architect Louis Khan and features 
a substantial courtyard with an 
unobstructed ocean view. The 
institute is a registered city of San 
Diego historical ite. 

The Salk Institute is a non-
profit research institution that was 
founded 40 years ago by polio 
vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk. The 
institute works to increase knowl-
edge about human health and to 
find cures for diseases such as can-
cer. Currently, the facility 
employs 56 faculty and over 850 
scientists.

Students First!: Board cites 
lack of objections in hearing 

continued from page. 3 
ing that an objection must be made 
for the case to be taken to the judi-
cial board. 

"The quick dismissal of the 
appeal seems to parallel the hasty 
disqualification of Students 
First!," Dan wrote. "Members of 
the judicial board were absolutely 
set on not listening to this 
appeal." 

Whether or not the Students 
First! slate plans to continue in its 
effort to have the election commit-
tees decision reversed and whether it 
will take its case to a higher authori-
ty is as of yet unclear, with slate rep-
resentatives declining to comment. 

Because ASUCSD IS a universi -
ty deparonent, the slate's next step 
after the judicial board, should 
they decide to pursue the matter 
through the administration , could 
include soliciting administrators at 
a universitywide level in the 
University of California's Office of 
the President or even with the 
Board of Regents. 

Student Regent Dexter Ligot-
Gordon said that he has been made 
aware of the disqualification of the 
Students First! slate, and, prior to 
the judicial board's decision, said 
that he would be "keeping an eye" 

on the h andling of elections at 
UCSD. 

"I'm concerned in general 
because I don't know whether or 
not the people who would be elect-
ed would be representative of who 
the student had chosen," Ligot-
Gordon said . 

According to Ligot-Gordon , he 
and one other regent have made 
administrators in th e UCOP 
aware of the situation at UCSD. 

He also expressed a desire to 
look further into the details of the 
case and to assess whether the si t-
uation with UCSD elections has 
universi tywide implications 
before deciding whether or not to 
step in. 

"As a general principle, [ would 
rather take into consideration inci-
dents that happen on campuses that 
have an impact on other campuses 
as well ," Ligot-Gordon aid. "But if 
the situation is extrem e enough 
where 1 feel that something on the 
campus is unjust or unfair, I'll use 
whatever capabil iti es I can to cor-
rect that." 

Ligot-Gordon has previously 
been involved in addresSing campus 
election concerns by asking for legal 
analysis in the case of expendinlre 
caps on campaign contributions.

UCSD honors the 50th

F or most students today, it is hard to imagi ne a time when the structure of DNA was unknown . Although this dis-
covery is presented as established fact in biolo-
gy classes, the revolutionary discovery is a rel~ 

tively young o ne. April 25 marked the 50t 
anniver ary of the publication of the emi-
nal paper by Francis Crick and James 
Watson, which was published in Naturt in 

1953 . 
"Both Francis and I had no doubts 

that Dl A was the gene. But mo t people did," 
said Watson 111 a 1983 30th anniversary tribute 
article in the magazine, amrt. 

More than any

has novel features which are 
of consi derable biological 
interest." 

The proposed mecha-

event was well-attended with faculty members 
from Stanford, UC San Francisco, California 
lnst'itute of Technology and other universities 
from around the nation . 

The real benefit of these events comes from 
the crossing over of ideas from one peclalty to 
another. It was data from other researchers 
that made the models work for \Vatson and

" If Jlln and [hadn't discovered D, A, some-
body else was bound to," Cnck said . "The 
tructure was waiting there to be discovered." 

It was X-ray crystallography pictures from 
Maurice Franklin and Rosalind Franklin that 
helped direct Watson and Cnck to the accurate 
double-helix structure and some orgaruc chem-
IStry ad\1ce that helped them match up hydro-
gen bonds in ba e pairs. According to the Los

The true story of 

W1adyslaw Szpilman 
is as rich a Holocaust 

study as SCHINDLER'S LIST, and arguably ROMAN POLANSKI'S 
best film since CHINATOWN . Polanlcsi himself survived the 
streets of Warsaw during the Nazi occupation, and this lends 
an authentic eye to the details. This story is so well told that 
the understated music score doesn't need to telegraph the 
drama. ADRIEN BRODY'S multi-layered performance as the 
Jewish prodigy rightly generated much attention; his several 
minutes on the Oscar stage jumped him straight to the A List.

UCSD students "Take Back the Night" 
A.S. Women's Commission encourages rallying against violence 

ByUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

As a part of Sexllal Assaul t 
Awareness month, the .S. Womens 

ommission presented Its annual 
"Take Back the ight" event on 
April 24. The event was a spirited 
and emotionally charged rally 
agai nst sexual assault and domestic 
violence in all its forms and promot-
ed an Increased understanding of 
gender issues. 

The first "Take Back the Night" 
rally was held In England in 1973, 
and the first American rally was held 
In 1978 in San Franci co. 

Many other college campuses 
held the rally also, and this is the 
thJrd year that UCSD students have 
put on such a presentation. Each 
rally presents a variety of perfonners 
and speakers, as well as a chance for 
previous victims to share their sto-
ries in a supportive environment. 

"The purpose of the event is to 
show commwtity solidarity against 
sexual assault by bringing tOf,rether 
speakers and performers and then 
allowing audience members to corne 
to the mic to tell their own tories 
and become survivors rather than 
victims," said Kristen Yager, presi-
dent of the A.S . Women's 
Commission. "The personal stories 
are the highl ight of the event and are 
Incredibly powerful and moving for 
the audie~lce . " 

This ycar began with two prelim-
inary perfonnances from musicians 
Will iam G and The Enchal1led at 
noon at the Price Center. The actu-
al event kicked off at the Price 
Center with a colorful group of 
Inusical guests, including The Biddy 
Bums, Swandivc, aba and Linda 

Sargent, who gave performances. 
T he Freedom Writers, UCS D's 
group of spoken word and freestyle 
artists, presented a series of spoken 
word performances. 

Tables were set up around the 
stage area wi th representation from 
the A. . Women's Commission, the 
UCSD Psychological and 
Cow1seling Services and the district 
attorney's office. A clothesline hung 
on one Side of the stage was fu ll of 
shirts with handwri tten message~ 
from se:l:ual assault victims, such as 
"It was Just a date!" and "He was mv 
uncle, the funny one in the family. 
They've forgiven him. r have nol. I 
Will always remember." 

" Rape and sexual assault is 
not a women's issue I but 

a human issue . " 
- Kristen Yace~ AS. Women's 

Commission President 

Guest speakers for the night 
included ancy Wahlig, program 
director of the UCSD tudent 
Safety wareness Program, Noah 
Kovner from Working Agai nst 
Violence by Empoweri ng Students 
(WAV.E.S.) and Dr. Cat 
Thompson from the UC 0 
Psychological and Coun eling 
Service. 

ccording to V ahllg, the chal-
lenge in sexual and gender issues is 
"to create fully respectful relation-
ships;" she asked the audience to 

evaluate their personal relationships. 
One aspect of a respectful relation-
ship involves each person honoring 
the others personal boundaries and 
expressing affection only with the 
other person's complete consent, 
meaning "there is no coercion of any 
kind by either partner," Wahlig said. 
"Respect is about giving attention to 
the other, to the other persons feel-
ings and experiences." 

Although "Take Back the Night" 
attracts a larger female audience, the 
event toddY focuses on Involving 
both men and women. tany rruJles 
either attended the e"cnt and assist-
ed 10 its planning. According to 
Wahlig, genders need to work 
together to create a society free from 
sexual violence. 

"[The event) is not male-bashing; 
that is a stereotype," said ha rlene 
Pasidero, a third-year Earl Warren 
College student who was inspired to 
join the A.S. Women's Commission 
afrer attending the event before. "I tS 
empowering to both [gender J and 
enl ightening to both sides." 

According to Yager, men are just 
as much involved in and; fceted by 
the issues that are presented during 
the event. 

"It is important that we empha-
size men\; role in eradicating vio-
lence," Yager said. "Rape and sexual 
a sault i not a wonJen S issue, but a 
human issue." 

"Take Back the ight" also raises 
i ues of campus afety. According to 
Wahlig, UCSD has a relatively low 
number of cases of assault or rape by 
strangers. The numbers for a sault 
by known acqualOtances, however, IS 
about the same compared with many 
other colleges. Some cases are 
reported, but, often, many .Ire not.

they have the leadership and 

commitment needed to tackle one of our 

Rachel Gare>. Guo,cIion 
Women unite: Heather Willens (left) and Robin Leathers anended la,'" Back 
the Night" and look on att-shlrts that depicted empowerment phrases 

"1 would say the greatest benefit 
lof the event] probably is that people 
who weren't aware previously of the 
problems of rape or sexual abuse on 
this carnpus become aware of [the 
issues]." said Cathlin Goulding, a 
fourth-YC1lr Warren student and 
member of the A.S. Women's 
Commis ion. 

Statistics from the Rape, Abuse 
& Incest ational etwork 
(RAJNN) reports that one out of 
every six American women has 
been the victim of an attempted or 
committed rape in her lifetime, and 
one out of every eigllt female col-
lege students will be raped. "Take 
Back the Ight" IS mostly present-
ed on college campuses because: 
women are rnost likely to be sexual -
Iya saulted between the ages of 18 
and 24. 

After the performance" ' pt:akers 
and audience stOnes, memt. :r~ of the 
A.S. Women's Comml"lon and 
from the audience marched around 
carnpus, symbolicaUy "t.tkll1g back 
the night" from all sexual Violence. 
As every battle has its war cry, the 
marchers cried out uplifong mes-
sages such as: "Yes means yes, and no 
means no! However, we dre ',wher-
ever we go!" 

Yager agrees that "Take Back the 
ighr" is an important event for 

empowering those who have suf-
fered and for those who care about 
issues of gender and sexual Violence. 

"To prOVide a forum for women 
to express their experiences and to 
hear those of others i an e:<traordi-
nary thing," Yager said. "It is an 
amazlI1g commullIty-budding 
event."

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Cross country bids goodbye to six runners 
By JEFF CHUNCi 

Staff Writer 

With the end of the year at 
UC D, the Tritons bid farewell to 
an integral group of seniors on the 
cross country team. These six mem-
bers led the womens team to a I 7th-
place finish in the 2002 Division II 
National Championship and the 
mens tcam to place 15th at nationals 
the year before. 

Leading the senior class is 2002 
All-American Audrey Sung, who 
placed 19th at nationals to close out 
a remarkable 2002 season that 
Included six top-10 fini hes. She also 
competes in the 3,000 meter for the 
track and field team and earned 200 1 
All-America and All-CCAA honors. 

"Audrey is a fascinating team-
mate," said fellow senior teve 
Martin. "She exemplifies the 
accomplishment of hard work and 
determination over time." 

Martin, with a degree in manage-
ment science from Thurgood 
Marshall College, was a team captain 
the past two years for the men and 
posted a season-best 34th at the 
Triton Classic Invitational last 
October. ow working ill L.A as a 
consultant for the Camden Group, 
he hopes to continue on with IDS-

tance running and is developing an 
alumni team with other graduates. 

Also joining Martin as a gradu-
ate last fall is Jason Stone. Stone 
also was a two-time captain, serving 
for the 2000 and 200 I seasons. He 
earned a psychology degree from 
Mar hall and currently works as a 
substitute teacher and looks to 
attend graduate school. 

"The last four and a half years of 
running at UCSD was a pleasure 
and a rewarding experience," Stone 
said. "I've made some lifelong 
friends during my time here." 

Alan Shapiro, an economics 
major at Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
was a four-year lettennan and earned 
team rookie of the year honors. He 
led his team with a 61 st-place finish 
in the 2001 nationals and helped the 
Triton place 15th overall. Even 
though the 2002 season was mired 
with injuries, Shapiro was able to 
place in five races and continues to 
run for the track and field team. He 
plans to work for SmithBarney and 
become a financial consultant. 

Also graduating this year is senior 
Caren Jordan. In her final season, 
Jordan placed three times and con-
ni buted to the success of the 
women's team that reached the 

ationa! Championships this year. 

he was unavailable for conunent. 
Rounding our the class is David 

Dunbar, who this year had four top-
20 finishes including a lOth-place 
showi ng at the Triton Classic 
Invitational and an 18th-place finish 
at the West Regional. He also com-
petes for the track and field team in 
distance running. 

"Dave is one of the fiercest com-
petitors I've ever met," Shapiro said. 
"He has the kind of intensity and 
fire you wish for in a teammate." 

One thing all these seniors shared 
in common was their respect for 
head coach Ted Van Arsdale, who 
was unavailable for comment. 

"You just can't say enough about 
him," Stone said. "He just knows 
and understands his team well and 
will always be an inspiration for my 
lifetime." 

Shapiro agreed, and said, "I 
couldn't have asked for a better 
coach to help me set and accom-
plish my goals." 

In regard to the future of the 
team, the seniors feel confident the 
team will continue to succeed. 

"There is a lot of hope and 
potential for this team in the coming 
years," Shapiro said. "We set a stan-
dard, and future teams should look 
to exceed it."

Soccer: Chiles, Saadati 
were starters for UCSD 

continued from page 15 
contributions off the bench and 
as occasional starters. 

UCSD men's soccer head 
coach Derek Armstrong was 
pleased with the effort that his 
seniors gave him. He specifically 
mentioned Fathy's ability to 
overcome a slow start to the sea-
son. 

"Burke grew from a rocky 
start to be an important player for 
our team," Armstrong said. 

Fathy finished the season 
with thne goals. Armstrong was 
also happy with Girimonte's 
game. 

"Tyler was tl1e epitome of a 
team player," Armstrong said. 

Saadati proved to be one of 
the key offensive threats for the 
Tritons this season. He was third 
on the team in goals, finishing 
the season with five . Saadati 
came to the Tritons just two 
years ago, but due to an inj ury 
his junior year, was only really 
able to play one season for the 
Tritons. 

"Bobby was a difference-
maker. One of the things I will 
remember about this year was 
how he set the conference on 
fire with his play," Armstrong 
aid. 

Chiles had a olid senior sea-
son, playing multiple positions 
for the Tritons. He started as a 
defensive player, but Armstrong 
al 0 had him play other posi-
tions. 

"Kris was responsible," 
Armstrong said. "He maintained 
the level of leadership and consis-
tent play that you expect from 
seniors." 

Chiles was named to the 2002 
All-Far West Region First Team 

by the National occer Coaches 
Association of America, after 
being named to the Second -Icam 
in 2001. 

Chiles enjoyed many high -
lights during his years at UCSD, 
including scoring a goal in the 
first minute of his final home 
game and having one of the best 
games of his career. Still, Chiles 
felt somewhat disappointed with 
how the season finished for the 
Tritons. 

"Unfortunately, this soccer 
team throughout the four years 
almost always fell short of my 
expectations during the pre-sea-
son. We have been extremely tal-
ented, but have missed the 
important breaks that a successful 
team needs," Chiles said. 

Though Chiles' career is over 
with the Tritons. he has plenty of 
options for his post-playing days. 
Chiles was named to the 2002-03 
Verizon Academic All-America 
Men's Soccer First Team for the 
College Division. The College 
Division includes all of Division 
LI , ill and National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics, and hon-
ors II rudent-athletes. Chiles 
also earned a ational Collegiate 
Athletic Association postgraduate 
scholarship. Chiles says he is 
applying to medical school for the 
fall of 2004. 

The Tritons have a chance to 
be very competitive again next 
year. They return 20 underclass-
men, including leading scorers 
Tiago Venturi and latthew 
Davey, in addition to goalkeeper 
Jeremy ookson. If they can fill 
the void left by the loss of this 
year's seniors, next year's team 
should be JUSt as strong as thIS 
year' .

UCSD men's soccer loses five of its seniors 
Chiles, Saadati among the five Tritons to graduate 

By JON MILES 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
loses five seniors after this season, 
and while it is not a great loss in 
terms of numbers, it will be a loss 
in terms of talent and experience. 

The seniors on this year's team 
helped lead the Tritons to an I 1-6 
overall record and a 9-5 record in 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association matches. 

Defenders Kris Chiles and 
Burke Fathy, mid fielders Tyler 
Girimonte and Derek Orchard, 

and forward Bobby Saadati all fin-
ished their careers at UCSD as 
seniors this year. Chiles and 
Saadati were full-time starters for 
the Tritons, while Fathy, 
Girimonte and Orchard made key

Spoiled fan 
tries to put 

losses In 
perspective 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

T oday I was going to talk abour how mad r am abour the way the NBA playoffs 
are going. Mad about nor only the 
fact the Lakers were losing, but 
also the way they lost, especially 
Thursday night. 

The three-rime defending 
world champions played like they 
would rather have been somewhere 
else. And if they keep playing like 
they did , they're going to be some-
where else real soon. 

r was pissed off and wanted the 
whole world to know. But I slept on 
it and realized something: I'm a 
spoiled sports fan . More specifical-
ly, I'm a spoiled basketball fan. 

ot able to sleep Thursday 
night, I tried to put it into perspec-
tive by imagining that I was a fan of 
another team. 

VVhat If I was a Timberwolves 
fan and my team had never won a 
playoff series despite having one of 
the top two or three players in the 
league on my team' What If I liked 
the Clippers, who, despite a seem-
ingly solid lineup and high expecta-
nons couldn't make the playoffs 
this year? (rhey need to move back 
to San Diego.) 

uppose I was a fan of any team 
in the Eastern Conference (i.e. 
Sixers, Pacers, ets) and J knew 
my team, even If it made it to the 
finals, didn't stand a chance against 
the west. 

I also thought about how much 
the league has grown to where 
there are so many good teams and 
so much compentlon. I know the 
KIngs gave the Lakers a scare last 
year, but for the past three or so 
year, the winner of any Lakers' 
playoff ene was more-or-Iess a 
foregone conel USlOn. 

All [hl~ Introspection and 
putting thlng~ IntO perspective 
ga\ e IIlC more respect for fan .. of 
other tcam~, but part of me .. tdl 
wanted to .. cratth m\' e\,ebalb out 
and pound m) head ;gam'ol the 
wall In fru .. tratlon . 

1 mean what If I wa .. a K.1Ilgs fan; 
(props to }"all for stili being around 
and Stl II being as fervelll as e,er, not 
that you need any more prai~c). I 
don't know" hat I would have donc 
If my tealll had been oh-so-dose for 
years, nevcr getting the chance to 
compete for the champloll5lup. 

\ "all, ye~ I do. I did Il dunng

whdc Illy team wallowed In 
rebuddlllg and heartbreak AmI 
what happened; Evelllually the 
team I love came through and It ha~ 
won the champion hlp each of Illy

So hang III there. ( Ot tim you 
need me to tell you that.) 'lake It

tearn evelllually Will win. Of cour .. e

UCSD student,athletes honored Women's 
crew ends 

regular 
season 

Tritons recognized for academic marks 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD athletic program 
honored several of the outstand-
ing academics within its ranks at 
an April 22 luncheon celebrating 

ational tudent-Athlete Day. 
ei l Kal ra , Emily Gray, 

Ca meron Jackson, Katie 
McGann,Denj e Bogard,Jeremy 

ookson, Chris Mortimer, 
Samantha Wong, Scott 
Destafney and Jennie Wilson 
were recogni zed for their 
achievements within their 
respective sports as well as acade-
mic achievement and community 
service. 

National Student-Athlete 
Day was created by the National 
Consortium for Acadetnics and 
Sports along with the Center for 
the tudy of Sport in ociety, and 
is co-spoll5ored by the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and National Federation of State 
High School Associations. 
According to UCSD Athletic 
Director Earl W. Edwards, more 
than 300,000 student-athletes 
were recognized last year. 

Women's volleyball player 
Wilson, an economics and math-
ematics rna/or with a 3.53 GPA, 
wa the student speaker for the 
event, and she expressed her view 
about the keys to success of the 
UCSD student-athletes. 

"Despite the fact that people 
say that other schools are more 
talented and they have faster ath-
letes, stronger athletes, we have 
the most dedicated athletes, and I 
thjnk that shows in terms of aca-
demics and athletics," she said. 

Jessica Horton/Guoidon 
Off the court: Women's volleyball player Jennie Wilson talks about her 
experience as an athlete at UCSD while other Tritons look on at the luncheon. 

Outside of individual dedica-
tion, the support system that 
allows the student-athletes to 
succeed, including coaches, ath-
letic administrators, faculty and 
university administrators were 
also on hand for the event. 

"There is support among fac-
ulty and staff at this school, and it 
makes you feel a lot better as an 
athlete knowing there i internal 
support," said McGann, a politi -
cal science major with a 3.85 
G PA. "It 's really mce seeing all 
the professors here. They out-
numbered us today." 

Despite the absence of athlet-
ic scholarships, the athletes at 
UCSD still receive a substantial 
benefit from the time that they 
spend within the program. 

" It's an honor to be playing 

college athletics, and so to be 
able to do that and still be at 
UCSD has been a great thing," 
said Cookson, an electrical engi-
neering major with a 3.76 GPA. 

lbe excellence assembled to 
celebrate National Student-
Athlete Day brought with it an 
impressive list of community ser-
vice achievements as well. From 
working with elementary school 
students, at soup kitchens, in 
beach clean-ups, or an any num-
ber of the other venues where 
UCSD athletes are serving their 
community, the 10 honorees not 
only deserved to be recognized
