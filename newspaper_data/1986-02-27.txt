Myths and 
masquerades 

Alben Einstein, perhaps the 
most respected sciemist of our 
time , told us that the most 
imponant aspect leading to great 
ideas, theories and inventions is 
intuition . This sixth sense, 
coupled with other extraordinary 
psychogenic abilities such as 
ESP, precognition, telekinesis 
and other powers related to the 
cosmos (and other divine 
systems) are often produced by 
altered states of consciousness 
(meditation, hypnotism, drugs, 
etc.). 

Analyzing dreams can help us 
to realize our hopes and fears 
and help tum them into reality. 

This Thursday night at 7:30, 
Judith Golden will make a 
presentation on "Myths and 
Masquerades," a retrospective 
exhibition of this artist's colorful 
and contemporary work in 
Balboa Park at the Natural 
History Museum Aud i. toriurn. 

Price of admission is $2.50 for 
members, $3 for students and 
seniors, and $4 for general 
admission . For further 
information, contact the Museum 
of Photographic Arts at 239-

Cal Grant system 
to be automated 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU, Capitol Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - Students public universities. ' Sam brings a 
rushing to meet Cal Gram lot of experience to the job ," 
application deadlines and then CSAC spokesperson Greg 
waiting months to find out Gollihur said . 
whether they qualified to receive Kip outlined the new goals of 
those awards may not have to the commission which over the 
put up with the long, drawn out years, he said, lost some of its 
process, according to the newly credibility with students, 
appOinted California Student Aid education institutions, and 
commission director. lenders. 

"Right noW, we have a process 
that produces an artificial early 
deadline on application closing," 
CSAC Director Samuel Kipp said 
at a CSAC Loan Study Council 
Meeting, when discussing last 
week's Cal Grant application 
deadline for next fall's gram 
recipients. CSAC is the agency 
that administers state and federal 
financial aid programs for 
students attending California's 
coneges and universities. 

"It just makes no sense to 
co ntinue with that kind of an 
operation," he said. "We're 
committed to automating the 
grant system." 

Currently, the gram processing 
is done by hand , which has 
caused a lot of "unnecessary 
duplication" and delay. Kipp 
said he hopes to create a 
"revolutionary" situation where 
campus financial aid officers, 
commission starr members and 
lenders "actuaDy have time to 
counsel and advise students, 
rather than ask them to Ulke 
numbers and continue to stand 
in line ," 

For eight years Kipp worked 
for the California Postsecondary 
Education Commission, where 
he was a financial aid specialist. 
He developed the first 
consolidated data base for 
student financial aid in 
California . He also developed a 
computer model used to estimate 
the enrollment impact and 
financial aid needs at the state 'S 

One problem the commission 
has been faced with is the rising 
default rate of Guaranteed 
Student Loans, the largest source 
of student firtancial aid for 
Califomia students. 

Over the past five years, the 
state's default rate increased from 
1.8 percent in 1980-81 to 16.6 
percent in 1984-85. Kipp said 
that the commission could not 
afford to continue in a "business-
as-usual" mode in this area and 
plans to "rake a more aggressive 
stand to re·establish the public 
confidence." 

Kipp began his new job last 
month by announcing that CSAC 
was suspending a San Francisco 
trade school, the Academy of 
StenographiC Ans from the GSL 
program for "repeated violations 
of program regulatiOns." He said 
that although "this is the first 
such action taken by CSAC, it 
will not be the last." His new, 
active leadership role has been 
apparent to CSAC members 
when compared to former 
Director Art Marmaduke who was 
"unable to change with the 
times," said one CSAC consultant 
who requested to be quoted by 
name. 

Kipp is "forceful , very 
concerned , very inteUigent and 
brings a combination of very 
good analytical skiDs along with 

politi~al concern for the issues," 
Gollihur said . fi:I

Spirits to forewarn sign in drinking establishments. "There was a 14 percent increase of awareness in New York on the hazards of drinking while 
pregrtant," he said. In 1979, 
similar legislation was introduced 
at the federal level, but Congress 
held off from enacting alcohol 
health warnings on containers in 
response "to promises by the 
beverage industry that it would 
engage in its own aggressive 
public education effon," Hart 
said, "but those promises have 
not been kept."

SACRAMENTO - Warning 

labels on beer, wi ne and distilled 
spirits containers would be 
required under a bill introduced 
Monday, aimed at informing 
pregnant women about possible 
health effects related to those 
beverages. 

The biD, authored by Sen. Gary 
Hart, D-Santa Barbara, would 
require alcohol be~rage 
containers to include a label 
which would read: WARNING: 
DRINKING ALCOHOL DURING 
PREGNANCY CAN CAUSE LOW 
BIRTH WEIGJiT, MISCARRIAGE 
AND BIRTH DEFECTS. 

"Consumers have a right to 
know the errect that a product 

can have on themselves and on 
their unborn child," Hart said 

According to the State 
Department of Alcohol & Drug 
Prograrns, drinking alcohol 
during pregnancy can cause a 
cluster of birth defects, known as 
Fellli Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), 
which include low binh weight, 
facial deformaties and menral 
retardation. Each year, close to 
600 newborns are afflicted with 
FAS in the state. In addition, 
about 3,600 newboms in the 
state are born with less severe 
effects. .....-

"The State Departmem of 
Health spends in excess of $140 
million on children each vear . 

who have been adversely effected 
by FAS: Hart said . Supponers of 
the SB 2291, including 
Consumers Union, a non-profit 
publisher of Consumers Reports 
say that the public has a right to 
know and that the bill will raise 
the consciousness of the effects 
of.drinking while pregnant. 

"We label cigarettes and we 
label medicines: said jim Shultz , 
Consumer Union policy analyst. 
"What we're talking about is the 
simple right to essential health 
infonn;llion about a product," he 
said. 

Shultz said New York state has 
pasred similar legislation, which 
requires the posting of a warning 

Han said he expects "massive" 
opposition from the beverage 
mdustrv. 

The biD would also create an 
alcohol hotline number and 
establish an "Alcohol and Binh 
Defects Education Fund" to fund 
training for medical and alcohol 
treatment providers and 
education materials. ~ 

In a suprise tumaround 
Wednesday night, the AS 
Council voted in a new 
subcommittee on alterrtative 
media funding with 
represenratives from the 
alternative media, from the 
media board , the AS Council and 
from the student body. 

The new commiuee replaces 
the prior councH subcommittee 
that did not include 
represenratives from the 
alternative media. 

Minority teacher program shelved 

In the same resolution , the 
council voted in, as 
representatives of the student 
body, Sergio Chavez and Barry 
Harris. It was the council's 
rejection of Chavez from the old 
media committee that prompted 
the resignation of AS 
Administrative Vice Presidem 
Ariel Anguiano on Monday. 

SACRAMENTO - A bill that 
would create a minority teacher 
training program between the 
University of California and 
California State University for 
300 prospective teachers was 
shelved on Monday by the 
Senate Appropriations 
committee. 

Assemblywoman Teresa 
Hughes, D-Los Angeles, authored 
the bill that would identify and 
recruit minority students enrolled 
in public high schools into 
teacher training programs. 
Currently, there is a shortage of 
.eachers in California and by 

1990; it is expected to increase 
to 85,000. Participants of the 
program would be given a series 
of diagnostic tests to identify 
strengths and weaknesses and 
then "be provided with tutorial 
programs to address any 
academic deficiencies aD through 
their undergraduate sraTUs: 
Hughes said. 

If these panicipants dl;cide to 
enroll in UC or CSU techer 
education programs as ,graduate 
students, they would receive 
financial assistance depending 
on undergraduate GPA's. 

"If U'ndergraduate GPAs were at 
least 3.5 , students would recieve 
scholarships for the fuD COst of, 
TUition," said Dr. Bernard Gifford , 
UC Berkeley dean of education. 
Students having between 3.0 and 
3.5 GPA's would receive partial 
scholarships. 

The program is designed to 
increase the level of interest 
among talented minority 
youngsters into the teachin,g 
profession, Gifford said. 

Opponents to the measure 
including the Deukmejian 
Administration and the 

, I 

Legislative Analyst believe that 
there are now programs that do • 
the same thing. 

' We don't understand why 
there's another $200,000 needed 
.. . when we have similar 
programs that are well-funded 
already," said Administration 
Spokesman Dick Ray. 

The bill is up for 
reconsideration . ' A couple of the 
potential votes were not there 
today," said Education 
Consultant jim Turner. The 
measure would need at least five 
votes to get out of committee. (z:J 

The meeting, which lasted 
three hours, was often imerupted 
by chants of 'The people united 
win never be defeated" by more 
than sixty members of the 
alternative media and other 
studem and community 
organizations that were in 
attendance. At one POlOt during 
the meeting, councilmember Greg 
MacCrone charged the chanting 
<:rowd and had to be restrained. 

The council also approved the 
resignation of Anguiano, dividing 
his duties as Vice President 
among councilmembers Michael 
Fahlbusch, Greg MacCrone and

The demystification of sexual activity 
By KATHY BECKETI, Contributing Opinions Editor 

EVERY YEAR, more than one million American teenagers become 
pregnant. American adolescents 
are not more sexuany active than 
their European counterparts; they 
are , however, many times more 
likely [0 become pregnant. 
Relucrance to use contraception 
and ignorance regarding 
reproductive biology thus greatly 
contribute to the seemingly 
unmanageable problem of 
teenage pregnancy, 

Western European countries 
have adopted several measures to 
demystify sex. In Sweden. for 
example. the National Board of 
Education ensures that by the 
age of seven, every child has 
been exposed to the basics in 
reproductive biology. By the age 
of l2. aD children are 
familiarized with a variety of 
contraceptive devices. 

In the United States. however, 
our Puritan background is 
blocking the path to education 
and enlightenment. We are 
taught to repress our sexuality, 
and , as a result. the information 
children do receive about sex is 
confused and replete with 
fallacies , The double standard is 
clear: to knOWingly enter into a 
sexual situation is tantamount to 
harlotry. while being "swept 
away" by passion is a forgivable 
mistake. The result is an 
unwillingness to plan ahead, and 
therefore the non-use of 
contraception . The movement [0 
remove sex education from the 
schools, which is led by Phyliss 
Schafly and a group called Eagle 
Forum. if it suceeds, would 
simply increase the level of 
ignorance that contributes to 
unwanted teenage pregnancies. 

In yet another misguided 
anempt to confront the problem 
of teenage pregnancy. President 
Reagan has attempted to restrict 
the availability of family planning 
services, The so-caDed "squeal 
rule" would force federally 
funded clinics to notify parents 
within 10 days of the 
prescription of contraception to 
minors, This measure was 

squelched in the courts on the 
grounds that it would affect the 
decision to use contraception 

rather~than the decision to 
become sexually active. Statistics 
clearly indicate that those 
countries with the highest 
incidence of teenage pregnancy 
also have the least open attitude 
toward birth control and 
sexuality in general. Any attempt 
to limit access to information 
and contraception would move 
this country in precisely the 
wrong direction. 

Some theorists have attempted 
to blame our high rate of teenage 
pregnancy on the welfare system, 
They reason that government 
assistance consti[Utes a,9 
incentive for young women to 
have children by ensuring that 
they wiD be provided for. There 
are. however. many flaws in this 
argument. Western European 
nations proVide far more 
generously for young mothers. 
yet their teenage pregnancy rate 
remains many times lower that 
that of the United States. In 
addition, unwed mothers as a 
group have displayed a 
surprisingly high level of 
motivation to terminate their 
dependence on the government. 
Seventeen years after the birth of 
their first child. only 25 percent 
received any financial assistance 
from the government. It is 
important to remember, too. that 
these are women who are not 
likely to have completed their 
high school education and who 
have little or no access to job 
training progl'llms. 

There is, though , an intimate 
relationship between social class 
and teenage pregnancy. Federal 
funding for abortions was

percent of black children in the

Serious Democracy 
Editor. 

As coordinator of last Friday's 
Mayoral Candidates' forum, I 
would like to comment on the 
fact that "the tone was less than 
serious when II of the 14 San 
Diego Mayoral Candidates spoke 
at UCSD~ (Guardian: 2/24/86). 
While to some degree this is 
true. the tone was not always 
serious, the event itself was a 
serious and important event for 
UCSD. It represented a serious. 
conscious effort on my part, and 
on that of the Lobby Annex and 
Associated Students to provide 
Students with as much 
information as possible so as to 
enable an "educated vote ." 
Furthermore. to have made the 
event "serious· and thus. denied 
the lesser-known candidates the 
right to speak. would be to 
override the democratic process. 
I think it says a 101 for UCSD 
that last Friday's event was 
indeed a non-discriminatory 
public forum .

Expensive Friends 
Editor: 

I find it interesti ng that so 
many people are opposed to the 
fraternity system. It is criticized 
for many reasons. many of which 
are unjustified . A few of these are 
that exclusiveness of the 
"Greeks." their values and their 
act of buying friends, 

who become pregnant often have 
a history of feeling deprived and 
neglected. Their pOSition in 
society provides them with little 
hope of altering their situation; 
while giving binh to a child 
provides them with a sense of 
purpose. as weD as someone to 

It is sad that some people 
don't get to join a special club 
because they can't afford it or 
because they don't have the 
looks or charm. Ukewise, it is 
also sad that many of my closest 
friends couldn't go to UCSD, or 
even a state universiry for that 
matter. They couldn't go be~ause 
they didn't have the grades or 
they couldn't afford it - even 
with financial aid. Unfortunately, 
society cannor give everyone 
access to e~rience and money 
necessary for other experiences 
because there are not enough 
resources available. Selectiveness 
exists throughout society and it 
can be unfair. but if we close 0([ 
opportunities for everyone. no 
one benefits. 

Another fault with the Greeks 
is their values, which they aren't 
forcing on anyone else. Is the 
opposition afraid they might 
evenruaUy accept those values if 
exposed to them in an organized 
fashion? You would think ~ople 
would try to understand another 

love and who will love them. The 
pervasive sense of fatalism that is 
the result of blocked or unequal 
opportunity is direcdy related to 
an apathetic attitude toward 
contraception. It is here that the 
feminization of poverty 
begins, ~ 

person's or people's ~rspective, 
accept the fact that the other . 
person has his beliefs and then 
continue to live by their own 
beliefs without needing to hurl 
insults at the other 
~rson/people , Instead people 
are generaDy intolerant and I 
suppose this is why we must 
have wars, 

People also say that the Greeks 
buy their ·pseudo-friends." 
What's wrong with that? It's not 
hurting anyone . The world Is 
such a cold lonely place (UCSD 
fits right in) that ~ople should 
be accepting of anything that 
opens someone up to meeting 
and becoming close to other 
people. Maybe it is forced 
friendship among clones because 
the same "type" join a fraternity 
or sorority, but everyone chooses 
their friends. The process of 
choosng them can be long. but 
unfonunately life here at school 
is very shon, Arter only four or 
five years most of us have to 
leave and make new friends. 
Having immediate close ties to 
people you like and people like 
you probably spares some 
loneliness and provides valuable 
and longlasting friends. Whether 
they are pseudo or not is 
irrelevant because fraternity 
members think they are real -
what should it matter what 
anyone else thinks? I only wish 
that the fraternities and sororities 
were more varied so that more 
people could feel comfortable 
joining.

A recreation of the creation stoty 
By JOHN HOLLIS 

W HEN I HAVE a kid. I'm going to do thinp different. You know, 
ex~riment a little bit. Perhaps 
take a new approach to 
fatherhood. Uke when he or she 
looks up in my eyes with that 
dazzled, blue~yed. five-~ar-old 
look. the one that asks .aD sortS 
of questions about sex and 
where people comc from. 111 
probably realize my kid is a little 
too young for the subtleties of 
Darwinian science and slap him 
with a simplified version of the 
creationist bir Make things a 
little easier ~y blaming it all on 
God , ~t I think I'd tell it 
different. Just for the heD of it 

To stan off the story. my story, 
Eden was created as a huge 
pla)ground for God's child. 
There was only one creation. a 
walking and talking human bemg 
caDed Emen and nothing else. 
because there 's only one ~rson 
in the garden. there is no nud 
for a name. 

Then I would delicately 
describe the male organ to my 
kid's delicate ears, and point to 
my fOrehead and say. "and right 
here it had a big one of those .. . 
nearly twenty inches." Of course. 
that would scan the kid giggling 
and sidetrack his or her 

aaention for a good half-an-hour. 
Then I 'WOuld tactfully describe 

the female oIPn to the kid and 
proclaim. ~and it had one of 
those running from Mre 
(pointing to my beDy-button) to 
over here (polnti", to my \ower 
back)." And again I would ha~ a 
lot of explainln, to do because 
kids act it in their head that a 
nait applin to CYelYone. and if 
Emen has both an ex:aaerated 
one of these and one of those, 
then my kid will want too. 
They're big on conslmncy, 

EventuaDy when I get back to 
the story, it would ,go like this: 
there Emen sat in Eden, with no 
friends. lots of time. nothing to 
do. and a solemn promise not to 
eat any of the red fruit no matter 
what. Faced with a boring 
situation, Emen complained to 
God about his loneliness and 
God listened . And on that day 
when' it lay down in the deep 
green to sleep and pray for 
another in the likeness. (Lo! and 
Behold!) instantly springing forth 
from his lower ribs were two: 
smaDer than the original. and 
less smart too.

between his lep, "I am Woman." 
said the sleepy looking other. 
CMIj~d at its two new ~ts. 
Emcn gave them names so that 
they could be trained: the first 
Adam, the second Eve. Aflltr a 
week. as is oftentimes true that 
~ts can be naughry when 
they're not suposed to. Eve and 
Adam ate one of the red fruits 
and we~ caSl OUI of paradise, 
Emcn. howe~r, stayed put; 
Emcn was no dummy. 

I'm sure my kid will eat all of 
this stuff up, even though there 
is no proof of an Emen, But if 
the kid starts asking about Emen 
and where it is now. I'D have to 
get really inventive , It'D go 
something like this: .. . and in 
the year 2000, Emen will have 
left God's side with the 
knowledge of the ages. a divine 
and deep understanding of the 
truth, and come into the outca51 

world to witness the 
development of the ~ts, Man 
and Woman, Ernen will be 
disrurbed at e~rything that has 
gone wrong from the original 
plan. It will stand high and 
mighry upon a mountain, 
pointing its immense forehead 
finacr accusingly at Man and 
Woman. 

"Adam, step fOrward ." Emen 
wiD say. 'I am going [0 strip you 
of aD of your lucky cards .. , your 
money and your power," Adam 
will become very nervous and 
ask why. 

' Because you cannot handle 
them. You were never supposed 
[0 have them. You are too 
aggressive, too insensitive . too 
ungiving." Then Man wiU cower 
in the corner, in fear; pleading. 
begging, emasculated. Then Eve 
will approach and demand the 
cards to be justly dealt to 

Woman, who will hold them 
more competently. • 

"No. foolish one," Ernen will 
reply, "you would make the same 
miSlakes as Man. Only the tables 
tum." Then Man wiD gain a 
moment of courage and assen 
that he was "only doing God's 
work . ,. after aD, Man is in his 
imase." With that. Emen will 
laugh and laugh and laugh. "You 
are nothing molt than one of my 
ribs!" it wiD reply. And that will 
be that. 

My little kid wiD leam this 
story. reteD it to all the little 
friends. and get laughed out of 
school. Then he or she wiD hate 
me for being cast out of the 
official counsel for five-year-olds. 
That's the risk 111 take . because I 
believe children's tales need 
rewriting. And retelling. Then 
equality won't have to be learned; 
it wiD be inscribed. rz:J

Budget squeeze 
Continued from page 5 
To decimate a whole 
smorgasbord of highly popular 
do~stic programs in this, an 
election year, would be 
tantamount to committing 
political hari kari , especially for 
Republican incumbants who 
have been distancing themselves 
from Reagan. 

When Gramm-Rudman finally 
succumbs, Reagan will be in 
perfect position to haIVest 
favorable public support although 
the majority is insisting 
somebody harness his 
astronomical deficits. He will 
then succeed in subplanting 
Gramm-Rudman with his own 
budget. That budget amounting 
to some S994 billion, was briefly 
touched upon in Reagan's State 
of the Union address February 4 
and unceremoniously dumped 

on Congress the follOwing day. 
His budget demands draconian 
cuts in many long successful 
domestic programs: S1 .3 billion 
will be loped of Medicaid for the 
poor, S4.7 billion from Medicare 
for the elderly, S1.6 billion from 
civil-service retirement , half-a-
billion from military retirees, 
another half-billion in medical 
care for veternns and $1 billion 
from education, a program he 
taunted in his speech as one of 
his highest priorities. 

During this same period, 
Reagan plans to lavish the 
Pentagon with excelerated 
monetary allotments to the tune 
of at least S16 billion next year 
alone. The Defense Depanmem 
may continue purchasing many 
wasteful "state~f-the-art" 
weapons SYStems while 
completely disregarding

New labels for 
. 

tobacco warnings 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU, Capitol Cornspondtnt 

SACRAMENTO - A bill that 
would require businesses to post 
signs in their retail 
establishments that warn 
smokeless tobacco users about 
potential health risks and makes 
penalties more strict for selling 
those products to minors was 
pur 'on hold" at the request of 
the chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. 

The bill's aurhor, Sen. Nicholas 
Pettis, D-Oakland, agreed with 
Sen. Bill Lockyer, the committee 
chair, to meet with opposing 
factions and "sit down and 
negotiate an agreement" on a 
proper warning sign, the amount 
of the fine for violators of the 
posting proviSion and the 
amount of the fine if vendors sell 
to minors, 

In the original bill, the sign 
would read: "Warning: The use 
of smokeless tobacco is addictive 

and may cause cancer." 
"I don't think I've read any 

joumal that has actually come 
out and said for a fact that 
tobacco is addictive," Sen. Milton 
Marks, D-San Francisco, said. 

Petris agreed to amend his bill 
to read exactly like the current 
federal legislation on smokeless 
tobacco warning labels which is 
headed for the President's desk. 
Those three lables are to be 
rotated every four months on 
smokeless tot)acco packages. 

"The first label would read: 
This product may cause mouth 
cancer, the second: This product 
may cause gum disease and 
tooth loss; and the third: This 
product is not a safe alternative 
to cigarettes," said AE. Davis, a 
lobbyist for the Smokeless 
Tobacco Council in Washington.

cannot change the wording or 
require any other kind of 
change, either on the label or 
advertising of these products. 

Another problem with the bill, 
according to committee members 
and those opposing the measure 
is how much of a fine would be 
imposed on those vendors who 
did not post warning signs. 

Under the bill, there would be 
a minimum S500 fine for the 
first offense, going up to S6,ooo 
for the third offense. 

"I've talked to people who are 
opposed to these numbers. They 
feel they're oppressive and they 
may be right. Maybe it's much 
too much on the high side. It's 
something we're willing to look 
at," Petris said. 

Sen. Diane WatsOn, D-Los 
Angeles, asked Pettis to reduce 
the fine for the second offense 
from SI500 minimum to 51000, 
and change the third offense 
form $6,000 maximum to 53,000. 

"The reason why I suggested 
this amendment is that often in 
the community stores ... a 56,000 
fine could put them out of 
business and we're trying to 
maintain some businesses in the 
community, but we're trying to 

say to them, 'you can't be 
negligent in this regard and I 
think a lower maximum and a 
higher minimum might catch 
their attention," Watson said. 

Pettis said he is not opposed 
to reducing the amount.

Meal skip fast . I 
to aid charities 

The AS is organizing a 
campuswide meal skip for March 
6, and proceeds will 11.0 to the 
San Diego Food Bank which aids 
se\veral charities. Commuter 
students are also encouraged to 
participate by making any 
possible monetary donations. 

"The basis of the project is the 
notion that it is easy to overlook 
the needy in our own 
backyard ... while we take action 
to aid people in developing 
countries half-way around the 
world," according to Muir Senior 
Senat<;,r. Greg M~C?"one, who is 
organlzmg the project. 

The Housing and Food Service 
Administration estimates that for 
each meal skip(lCd, SUO will be 

!Fofl( 

donated to the project. That 
money, along with commuter 
donations, will be used to 
purchase refrigerators and food 
and to distribure these to the 
hungry people in San Diego, 
according to MacCrone. "There 
is especially a big problem in the 
gaslamp district downtown." 
MacCrone said, "It is a sad 
situation and the needs of those 
people are often overlooked." 

ust quaner, 1,000 students 
participated in the meal skip 
held exclusively within Muir 
College, and with this 
campuswide program, MacCrone 
hopes that more than 2.000 
people will take part.

By KEN FURlE, FtlJlurrs Editor 

N OT SO LONG AGO, the Guardian Office was visited by the Manin Luther King Jr. Elementary School's College Preparatory Academy. We gayc them a tour through the Guardian office, they stole a few razor . 
blades, gawked a bit, had a few of their names run out on our typsctter, asked 
a lot of questions and generally had a good time. In return, Phil Willon, editor 
in chief, asked that they take some time to write a sentence or twO on what 
they wanted to be when they grew up , and to draw a picture. 

When I was a kid in the '60s, there was a pretty wide variety of goals for 
boys, ranging mainly from astronauts to doctors, from athletes to race car 
drivers. Of course, war played a pan in what we did . We played ·cowboys 
and Indians," and it was the absolute pinnacle of coolness to be chosen on 
my block to be the Redskin Chief Wooga Wonga, who led the stealthy Indian 
attacks. 

But the sneaky, ecologically concerned Indians of my boyhood seem to 
ha'A! changed , in these conservative times, into Russians. Probably one of the 
most striking aspects of the papers and drawings received from the boys is 
that many of -them want to serve their country. Looking at the photos, it is 
more than obvious that Sylvester StaUone as Rambo has taken his toll in the 
minds of the youths. For instance, this picture: 

This is jUst the first in a series of children who want to serve their country in 
one way or another, but what is really Stanling is the compltte emotional 
distance these children have from the idea of kiDing. Perhaps· it is indicative 
of, as some assen, the fact that canoons are toO violent. Perhaps it is the 
commonness of kiDing, rather than just ca~, thar,pcrmcares the meditt.~ '" 
The figure in the drawing by Rafael Tony Gon~s too closely resembles 
Rambo for much doubt in this matter. '

T HERE IS ANOTHER dramatic change from the goals of children of the '60s which is heanening to note I distinctly remember that when the teacher would ask what we children wanted 10 be when we grew up, 
there was always more than one girl who would say with pride that she 
wanted to be a ·mommy." 

When I grow up I want to be a football 
player. I want to play quanerback I want to

I doubt that the instinct or desire to have children is any I~ss in modem 
times, since the doD industry is as big or even bigger than it always has been, 
but there was not one girl from this panicular class who expressed the desire 
to be a "mommy" as her main objective in life. Apparently, the women's 
liberation movtment has had its effect on the way girls see themselves, as weB 
as the way they see their own future.

Poetry Archives hiding atop Central 
By MARlA SCHNEIDMAN, Staff Writer / 

MOST EVERYONE who goes to Central takes the elevator to the fifth or 
sixth floors . Yet, few people are 
aware of what lies beyond these 
popular stops. On the mystenous 
eighth floor a very special 
collection of archives can be 
found which have been put on 
exhibit through the help of 
library funds and personal 
donators . 

I was informed that UCSD is 
the second best school in the 
country for possessing the most 
imponant archives collections of 
new poetry, and the assistant 
curator Brad Westbrook also told 
me that the libra!)' will spend up 
to $35,000 for one box of 
archives of new poetry at a time! 
Most of the archives are able to 
be purchased through a special 
operating fund , though there are 
several people who donate items 

which they think will enhance 
the exhibit. 

The Mandeville Collection of 
Special Archives is presented 
with a very specific goal In 
mind. It is not there simply to 
entenain, but to complement a 
panicular academic program. 

The present exhibideatures 

various works from several poets 
named David Ignatow, Karl 
Shapiro and Joe Brainard. Some 
other items of interest feature the 
documents of the William 
Westmoreland vs. CBS trial. 
General Westmoreland sued CBS 
for their portrayal of him and his 
actions during the Viemam War. 
His primary charge against Dan 
Rather was that he felt they 
misrepresented figures who 
continued aid to the South 
Vietnamese!. CBS ended up 
winning the trial. 

A very interesting fact is that 
UCSD is one of three universities 
who are fortunate enough to 
have these complete transcripts. 
The other schools are Yale and 
Berkeley. The transcripts I found 
the most interesting are those 
which outlined·the controversies 
over the construction of the 
three nuclear power plants in 

Southern California, at San 
Onofre, Sundcsert and Diablo 
Canyon. 

A few other exhibits feature 
letters which were written to 
John Taggan. This is considered 
unique material for scholarly 
research because the letters 
provide insight into the creative

The last exhibit I noticed is a 

collection of Baja California 
letters by Richard Dening who 
was an employee of the Lower 
California Co. The letters date 
from 1858 to the late 1870s. The 
most interesting feature of these 
letters is the fact that the 
correspondence was extremely 
rare during this period. With. 
these letters we are able to gam 
firsthand knowledge of this era 
in history as Dening tells of 
incidents such as the murders of 
companions by the Indians and 
daily life In the mines. 

Some of the past exhibits 
included Leo Szilard who was 
the father of the first atom buster 
in Chicago. He worked 
extensively on the Manhattan 
project and prOtested the . 

development of nuclear 
technology. Another featured 
Ernest Kreneck, a musician who 
taught at UCSD. The library, 
along with the ",usic librarian, 
helped put together many of his 
works. 

Some future projects planned 
for the archives collection will 
feature such notables as George 
Oppen and Stuan Hughes. 
Oppen was a San Francisco 
Pulitzer Prize winning poet. The 
libra!)' funds helped to purchase 
his papers, correspondences and 
manuscripts, which win be 
arranged and organized after a 
conference in mid-May.

Women crush Christ College; 
finish year on oflbeat note 
By FLIP HARRISON, Staff Wriltr 

T HE TRITON women's basketball team closed out its year with a bang Friday 
night, beating a weak Christ 
College team 86-64. The Eagles 
did not have a prayer in their 
second game of the season 
against UCSD, after dropping 
their first season meeting by a 
score of 101-3B. In fact, if it were 
not for the lack of night life at 
Christ College, the six players 
that make up the squad probably 
would not have shown up. 

The Tritons should not break 
their arms patting themselves on 
the back, however, as the lowly 
Eagles almost made it a game. 
Ahead by 22 at halftime, the 
Tritons had their lead cut to 
nine four minutes into the 
second half. For the rest of the 
quaner, however, the Tritons' 
overpowering defense enabled 
the club to squash any hopes of 
an upset by the Eagles - an 
upset that would have left the 
eanh shaken and the heavens 

both team leaders for the young 
squad. Gregory scored nine 
points and grabbed six rebounds 
in the game to end a somewhat 
disappointing season. Kept out 
of play in the early leg of the 
season by a knee injury, Gregory 
ended up averaging 6.1 points 
and 4.B rebounds for the season. 
She leaves the team as UCSD's 
third career rebounder with 646, 
and seventh in career scoring 
with 624 points. Lynne McLevie 
played a great final game, busting 
for 16 while grabbing 12 boards. 
For the year McLevie averaged 
8.1 points per game and 6 
rebounds. In just twO years as a 
Triton she achieved 13th place 

Jungling's performances this year, 
averaging 11 .3 points and 5.B9 
rebounds, while shooting an 
average of 41.5 percent from the 
floor per game. 

Courtney Simpson also played 
a good game with radar-like 
shooling of 75 percent to hit for 
14 points. 

Thus the Tritons end a fairly 
mediocre year, although the 
season is speckled.-wUb. lUsh, _ 
points. With an overall record of 
11-14, B-7 in Division UI play, 
UCSD suffered mostly from poor 
shooting. ' Offense was the most 
disappointing part of our game 
this year," said coach Malone. 

smiling. 
Seniors Jennifer Gregory and 

Lynne McLevie put in their last 
performances for the Tritons, 

in UCSD's career scorers with 
355 points. "We are going to 
mIss them both: saia coach 
Malone. 

Great performances in the 
game also came from Heidi 
Jungling and Courtney Simpson 
- two players who will 
undoubtedly play major roles 
next year. Heidi wrapped up a 
spectacular year by shredding 
the nets with 26 points and 
clearing the lanes for 12 boards. 
Not enough can be said about 

Tritons and Gulls 
treat fans in finale 
By MAlT lAIT. Staff Wnur 

T HE I.ARGEST and noisiest home crowd of the season perhaps in Triton Pavilion ' 
history, saw the men's basketball 
team close OUt its schedule 
Tuesday night in an exciting 
shootout against USIU , where the 
Tritons lost 103-94, capping off 
the year 14-12. 

The outcome of the game was 
almost secondary to the 
unprecedented crowd suppon. It 
was the kind of crowd you see 
on national television. USIU 
coach Gary Zaresky could not 
believe it. "The fans here were 
great. They were the highlight of 
the game: he said , "It's the beSt 
crowd suppon we've seen all 
year. 

"I don't know what gOt them 
so hyped up but if they were like 
this every game, the Tritons 
would go vinually undefeated. It 
would also give them the Vote 
they would need for getting into 
the tournament. Teams would be 
afraid to play4hem." 

Zaresky added , "If this crowd 
awakens like this, it would be 
great for the San Diego 
community. Teams like USIU, 
SDSU and USD would have to 
watch out for UCSD." 

At the start of the game it 
looked as if the USIU Gulls 
would walk away with an easy 
win. They played rough defense 
and shOt extremely well. Just four 
minutes into the game the 
Tritons were down by 11 , 17-6. 

Then it was UCSD's time to 
get hot. Sparked by a behind-
the-back pass from Kamansky for 
a Sutherlin dunk, they fought 
back to make the spread only 
one pOint, 20-19. By the time the 
first half was over, and the 
furious flurry of flinging the ball 
through the hoop had ended, 
the Tritons were down by seven 
53-46. 

points to the Gull 's two and 
capturing the lead 56-55. That 
was the last time the Tritons had 
the advantage . From that point 
on, although it was very close, 
USIU held on to the lead to win 
the game 103-94. 

With this loss the Tritons 
ended their season with a 14-12 
winning record . 

Junior guard Greg Kamansky 
said , "It was a good year. We 
had some games which we 
should have won. I had my best 
year personally." Kamansky did 
have a great year, leading the 
team in scoring for most field 
goals scored in a game and total 
points scored in a game. 

AnOther great performance this 
year was by swing forward 
transfer junior Brian Backens. 
Backens had a IB.3 scoring 
average while breaking a school 
record for highest percentage 
from the field in a season with 
59.4 percent. 

Freshman Mark Sutherlin had 
a very fine year working his way 
into the starting line-up and 
should be a force next year in 
the front court along with Andy 
Jedynak who also had a strong 
season. 

Sophomore guard Mike 
Alvarado, who also won a 
starting position in the middle of 
the season "showed great 
maTUrity," according JO Marshall . 

Jim Smith was another 
valuable member of the team 
leading it in assists with 172. 
"He could be a team leader next 
year," said MarshaU. 

The Tritons will sorrily miss 
the slrong play of both Thor 
Dekker and Bill Reese who will 
be graduating this year. 

Highlights o[ the st:ason came 
for the club mainly in the month 
of January. With a 7-2 P!cord 
and a six-game winning streak 
in the month , the Tritons really 
came together as a club. "We 
had a streak where we were 
playing good solid basketball," 
said coach Malone, "especiaUy 
around the time of our winning 
the La Jolla Classic T oumament. 
Winning the tournament and 
getting revenge against Whittier 
were definitely the high points of 
the season." 

The future looks promising for 
the women's team. With 11 

• returning players in'e1uding 
Jungling, Simpson, Shellie Velie, 
Shanda Elzy, Nidirah SCOtt and 
Tracy Ragarz along with any 
recruit they will probably prove 
to be a good Division III club. ~ 

2 week ' 
layoff slows 
Tennis 

A two-week match layoff does 
not a sharp tennis team make. 
Women's tennis coach Liz La 
Plante found that out this last 
weekend when her Tritons lost 
to NAlA Westmont eight matches 
to one. It was the Tritons' - the 
defending National ChampiOns 
in Division III - first loss to 
Westmont in years. 

"We just weren't reaDy very 
sharp," said La Plante of her 
team's effort, 'Westmont didn't 
have the layoff we had and it 
showed - they were just a little 
sharper than we were that day." 

The Tritons took Westmont to 
three three-set matches, but only 
the number one doubles team of 
Jessica Vernon and Maggie 
Merickle (both seniors) could 
emerge with a victory, 6-2, 6-1. 

The match was not a complete 
loss , however, as the next day 
saw the Tritons take on NAJA Cal 
Lutheran and win 9-0 in 
matches. "Getting some playing 
time really helped us the next 
day against Lutheran," said La 
Plante, "Everyone really played 
well and was determined to win 
after the day before (versus 
Westmont) ." 

The coach singled out 
sophomore Rhonda Meier for her 
singles perfonnance, as the 
number five singles player won 
handily 6 -0, 6-0. "Rhonda played 
a very impressive match," said La 
Plante.

Marshall said he was "very 
fortunate to have quality kids in

Bennett Sets 
Superstar Record! 

The 11th annual UCSD Superstars All-
Spons Competition came to another 
glorious conclusion this pan Sunday 
under perfect skies and even better 
competitive cQnditions. And as is usually 
the case in this type ofaffair, a newall-time 
record was established. This time the 
culprit was Randy Bennett, a 5-10 bundle 
of dynamite, that kept the pressure on 
.from the instant the staner's gun fired in 
the very first · event, the 6O-yard dash . 
Bennett won his heat in that event with a 
blazing 6.72 clocking and then 
methodically went about his business in· 
the next seven events to finish with a 
phenomenal total of 6198 points. 

Bennett, a fifth year senior and former 
point guard for the Triton basketball team, 
was competing in Superstars for the very 
first time. His 6198 totally blitzed the old 
record of 6086 set by Steve Lash in 1984. 
When asked after th:- competition, about 
how he felt he' might do, Randy's answer 
was a "bit scary. "I looked at the poim table 
and figured if everything went well, I could 
score 6200 points." Obviously, Randy was 
in touch with his bIOrhythms last 
Weekend. Anybody that can shave things 
that close has gOt to be super human, or a 
little wacky. 

Bennen was a model of consistency, 
cllmbmg all over the poim totals in every 
event. His worst score and event was wonh 
676 points (a 223-ft heave in the softball 
throw) which wasn't that bad at all. In 
everything else, he was near flawless. He 
won both the basketball supershot 
competition and the mile run , and 
fimshed second m both the 60-yard dash 
and the high Jump. His hlgh jump 
performance was panicularaly impressive 
as he cleared 5-8 and narrowly missed 
clearing his height, 5-10, on his second 
jump. 

It took all of Bennett's heroics to 
overshadow a number of excellent 
performances in what easily qualifies as 
the second best overall competition in 
Superstars history. No fewer than 14 
athletes (out of 35) finished over the magic 
5000 and a number of competitors earned 
spots on the all-time tOP twenty scores list. 

Right behind Bennett with a sterling 
performance of his own was Dave Vasil, 
another fifth year senior taking his third 
try at the elusive point tables. Vasil, a 
natural candidate to be Chariman of the 
Board at the Avis Corporation someday, 
finished in the runner-up spot for the 
second straight)'ear. But it wasn't for lack 
of effon. Vasil pushed Bennett to the max 
in the high jump and mile narrowly missed 
taking the whole enchilada. Winning both 
the weightlifting and softball hitting 
competition, Vasil pounded our 6013, the 
founh best supestars score of all-time. 

Karen Prather, a multi-talented all-
around athlete from one of the real garden 
spots of the state, Beaumont, Calif., 
narrowly missed annexing a new 
Women's all-time record. Her 5627 effon 
missed eclipsmg Elaine Bergman's 
standard (5637) by a mere 10 points. -
Prather, a floor hockey and tennis buff, 
who seemingly can do anything on an 
athletic field, racked up over 700 points in 
six events. The sad thing about missing by 
so little is a frustration in itself: ten poims 
on the Superstars scoring table is lifting 
two more pounds in the weightlifting, 
throwing three more feet in the softball 
throwing, or knocking down three more 
pins in bowling. 

Prather entered the competition at the 
last hour after listening to her buddies 
Keith Cramer and Bill Dooley argue for 
days on who was better. The real beauty of 
the whole thing nearly came to pass as 
Ptather not only JUSt missed at the record 
attempt, but nearly succeeded in tOpping 
both Cramer and Dooley. Only a blazing 
last lap in the mile run by Cramer 
prevented Prather from sweeping them 
both under the rug. Who needs women's 
lib, when there's women like Karen Prather 
around to keep all of us macho guys from 
getting big heads?

: bob's book review : 
• • ! Classic Mr. Moto· ! 
• I • by robert leone • 
: Think Fast, Mr. Mota is one installment of a paperback re-release of • 
.John P. Marquand's Mr. Moto series. This panicular book was first' 
• copywritten in 1936. It shows its age, but for that reason (and few others) • 
• is still fun to read. • 
• When 1 read this book, I was struck by images which I'd seen before in : 
• Andre Malraux' Man's Fate. In fact, Marquand.'s ~k reads ~ike a. h~rd- I 
• boiled parody of Malraux's. The background IS Chma, a Chma dIvIded. 
• into national concessions, a China preyed upon by greedy merchants who. 
I skim off the land and ship the residue back home. The games people play. 
: are politics, and they play them for keeps (Mr. Moto is trying to cut off. 
• funding for the local opposition to Japan's takeover of Manchuria). Bars. 
• and casinos are as rough a~ they come, if you sear~h under the su~face .• 
• About the only difference IS that Marquand has an Innocent loose m the' 
• works, one who will find a girl he wants to marry. And, o~ yes, Marquand: 
• takes the side of the imperialists, and as soon as poss~ble change.s the. 
• setting to Hawaii, after some seemingly senseless play In Shanghai that. 
• makes sense around page 200. • 
• This book is dated. How dated? Well, if you can immediately figure out. 
• why the scion of an American banking family is cautioned not to marry a • 
• Russian, you won't have too many problems. Amateur historians and. 
: trivia buffs could buy this book and rate their knowledge of the 1930s 
• eastern hemisphere politics by finding how much ~heydon't understand. 
• That and a "classic" status are best features of thIS book.

Dealing with a full deck 
by awtavo .. nt~yo 

From the moment these 
four Latinos slink onstage, 
their visual cool is 
immeditaely apparent. Baggy 
pants, suspenders and slickly 
coiffed hair comprise their 
snazzy look - a throwback to 
the zoot suit era of the '405 
and '50s. The Wild Cards 
aren't just cool cats in flashy 
threads - they're a band 
teetering on the brink of 
stardom, combining an 
addicting concoction of swing 
jazz and rhythm and blues 

with an energetic jittery-
spasmic flair that has made the 
Wild Cards · ·one of the 
premier club bands in 
Sdbthern California. The 
Wild Cards will bring their 
sass and class to UCSD when 
they play the Pub on 
Saturday, March 1. 

Accolades for the group 
keep pouring in. The LA 
Times mentioned the Wild 
Cards as one of the top bands 
to follow in the footsteps of 
groups like X, the Blasters, the 
Go-Go's and Los Lohos. 
David Adelson writes in 
Cashbox Magazine: "The Wild 
Cards blend elements of jump 
blues, rock and roll, funk and 
Jazz to come up with a sound 

that brings you back to the 
glory days while maintaining a 
comtemporary edge." Cary 
Darling of BAM magazine 
describes the band as 
possessing "a skillful mixture 
of musical idioms and visual 
pizzazz. " 

This is pretty incredible 
stuff for a band that's been 
together for only three years. 
But once you've seen one of 
their shows, you'll under-
stand the skyrocketing 
popularity. Lead singer / 

guitarist Adrian Remijio, 
rhythm guitarist Jesse Reyes, 
bassist John Frias and 
drummer Jesse Sotelo Jr. all 
contribute their personalities 
effectively. What results is a 
sizzling energy blast. Remijio, 
who along with lyricist Kent 
Wilson, writes and arranges 

,most of their songs, possesses 
a smooth voice that can melt 
as well as sear. Remijio is the 
force behind the Wild Cards' 
infectious sound. Reyes and 
Frias are the wild in the Wild 
Cards, each displaying his 
knack for showy theatrics 
Reyes is a dazzling dancer, 
pirrouetting ala Baryshnikov, 
staKKering like a drunken 
sailor, and doing a speed jitter

all in the same move. Frias, in 
his trademark Raybans, is the 
streetwise, jive -talkin' 
coolster, who not only 
pounds out some heavy bass, 
but also makes the dancers on 
Dance Fever look like 
cement blocks. Jr . Sotelo not 
only lays a solid foundation at 
the drum, he also does some 
excellent harmonizing. 

Put It all together and you 
have a performance that heats 
the audience to the boiling 
point. A recent show a t the 
Club Lingerie in Los Angeles 
saw throngs of people turned 
away at the door. The band 
has opened for several major 
acts, including Los Lobos, the 
Untouchables, the Busboys 
and the Blasters, but several 
times, the Wild Cards have 
literally stolen the show. The 

Del Fuegos, the critically 
acclaimed rockers from 
Boston suffered this fate at the 
Palace in Los Angeles a few 
months ago. The Club was 
packed and the Wild Cards 
played a set that had the 
crowd in a frenzy. But when 
the Del Fuegos - no musical 
slouches themselves - came 
onstage, they discovered a 
half-empty Palace. "You 
could tell the intensity level 
went way down," said 
Remijio in a tone, aot of 
braggadacio, but of awkward 
surprise. 

Some of the uniqueness of 
the Wild Cards come from 
the originality of the sound. 
"People think I have this huge 
collection of Cab Calloway 
and Louis Jordan," said 
Remijio. tt l like their music, 

but I didn't have any of their 
records. Igcew up listening to 
'70s rhythm and blues, like 
old Tower of Power, the 
Average White Band and 
Earth, Wind and Fire." 

Right now, the grOlip is 
having a lot of fun and 
enjoying the music they truly 
love. "When we play, it's 
because we love what we're 
doing," said Remijio. " We're 
not doing this because of the 
money end of it, we just love 
what we do. We're having a 
lot of fun, but we also want 
to stay progressive." 

The Wild Cards play the 
kind of music that has your 
feet shakin' and your fingers 
snapping. If you go to one 
show all year, this is the show 
to see because the cool cards 
are smokln·. 

Warren theatre goes East 
by daniel thoma. 

Graduate playwright Oana-
Maria Hock and director Ross 
S. Wasserman, working along 
with designers, actors and 
crew, have produced a 
senstive and winy show by the 
somewhat inscrutable name 
of East European Tetralogy. It 
purports to tell, in four parts 
(Tetra-logy, get it?) _the tale of 
an east European woman who 
returns to her homeland of 
Pradoslavia with her 
Californian husband. 
Playwright tIock Is in fact 
from Rumania, where she was 
a drama critic and dramaturge 
with the National Theatre in 
Bucharest. 

Within her play runs a 
contrast between the two 
cultures of East Europe and 
West Coast America, as 
expressed .. by one who has 
been in both places and seen 
the differing cultural realities 
of family, work and everyday 
life. Much of the humor of the 
show comes from the 
characters' attempts to relate 

Show continues this weekend ... 
to each other in their own 
cultural terms. Hock also 
pokes a good deal of fun at the 
restriction of life in a socialist, 
"managed" society. Instant 
popping corn is forbidden in 
Pradoslavia, American 
cigarettes, whiskey and 
condoms are worth their 
weight in gold . An electrical 
inspector interrupts the 
family wedding feast, and is 
treated with a deference which 
Americana would rHerve for 
the FBI. Three construction 
workers announce they are 
under ordrs to tear the top 
two floors off a new 
apartment building. A 
restaurant will deliver a green 
salad only after payment of a 
bribe. 

The work is deceptively 
simple in its nature. Ms. Hock 
has said, "This is not a 
political statement. I want to 
present human situations that 
are real, although somewhat 
extreme and at times absurd." 

To this end, several of the 
government inspectors and 
guards repeat the refrain, "I 
have a family to feed. I'm just 
doing my job." A good line, 
but it seemed to be ·too often 
repeated in the show . 
However, the real strength in 
this work is in the family of 
the Pradoslavian woman. 
They are, after all, the reason 
she went back to visit, with 
her husband. They are the 
"human situation" Oana-
Maria Hock has written 
about, and the audience can 
share in their joy at seeing the 
long-lost daughter come 
home again. They hold their 
own wedding for their 
daughter (granddaughter/ 
sister/cousin/niece ~ it's a 
big family), in an extremely 
touching scene staged behind 
a scrim, while downstage, the 
old boyfriend (now a doctor 
- "Doctors still have it good 
here .. . " ) sits in shadows, 
smoking an American 
cigarette.

Sounding like a poor 

imitation of another local

Slick's first release, Father 
Napalm, is a six-song EP with 
ver~ little depth. Produced, 
written arranged and 
performed by the brothers 
Cronin - no relation to The 
Guardian's own Matthew 
Cronin - Father Napalm is an 
album intended, supposedly, 
to raise our consciousness to 
certain issues, chief among 
them Apartheid.

troops into the autonomous 
state of Angola. Indeed, the 
only other song remotely 
political is the catchiest cut on 
the album, "AKM," a 
Pacifistic cut about farmers 
trained by the KGB to fight. 
But even this cut suffers from 
a hollow production sound 
that is punctuated by a 
Hammond-esque style 
percussion beat that pervades 
the entire LP. The other songs 
on the album - "Jeans to 
Jeans, " "Gutter Trash," 
"South Blackstone Street" 
and "Last Rhapsody" - are 
forgettable cuts that suffer the 
same synthesized fate as their 
Jjolitical counterparts. 

Cronin's vocals are at time 
persuasive if raspy, but most 
of Slick's lyrics are 
unconvincing attempts at 
tough street talk. Perhaps,che 
off-beat guitar rhythm (a la 

I~ ltf I 
the Trowsers) is the album's 
only redeeming quality, but as 
a political statement, the 
Slick's Father Napalm is more 
of a burn out than a coherent 
statement.

boys' hearts. We say the same 
things about guys that they say 
about girls." The band's new 
material still has a '60s tinge, 
but it is all much more 
commercial. This, along with 
the growing importance of 
college radio in influencing 
the public's taste has given 
them a national following. 
Rumors have it that young 
boys across the nation have 
been thrOWing themselves at 
the feet of the Pandoras 
whenever they play. 

Though mellow jazz may 
work well in the small 
confines of the Pub, The 
Pandoras' concert was not 
well accomoda ted. The 
accoustics and lack of dance 
space for the 450 people that 
went to Saturday'S show were 
a disappointment. For a 
crowd of this size, the space is 
simply too small. 

Despite these restrictions, 

The Pandoras played a good 
set of upbeat songs and were 
well received by the audience. 
Highlights of their show were 
"You Don't Satisfy Me" and 
"The Hump," during which 
Pierce brought two (male) 
fans on stage to do the 
"hump," chI" band's favorite 

new dance. Paula Pierce 
brought back fond memories 
when she yelled "We want 
you to have fun." They 
remind you of the girls in high 
school that you couldn't take 
home but you alwa ys had the 
most fun with.

Do you remember when you 
were linle and your mother and 
father yelled at you to clean your 
room, do your homework, eat 
your spinach, etc .. . ? And do you 
remember how relieved you were 
when you got to Revelle and 
thought you were freed from the 
restrictions placed on you at 
home? What could be benerthan 
living with your peers, eating 
when and what you want (even 
though it's Revelle cafeteria food), 
waiting until the night before to 
write your Humanitites paper, 

and generally doing what you 
want to do without censure? Well, 
nothing. Nothing at aU, except 
that there is a level of student 
conduct that must be upheld to 
maintain our idyllic life here at 
Revelle. Student conduct, what 
kind of student conduct? We can 
do anything, we're college 
students. Now, contrary to 
popular belief, students do have 
to abide by some rules and 
regualtions at UCSD, and we on 
the Judicial Committee 
sometimes have to remind a few 
students of this set of rules and 

so that all do

nO[ think that we Just sit around 
and play 'Junior prospector" and 
bang the ~gavel", I thought I'd 
update you on the purpose of 
Revelle Judicial Committee and 
on how we serve the students and 
Revelle College. 

Our comminee functions as 
both a fact finding and an 
adjucating body. If you do 
something that does not comply 
with the University policies or 
regulations, then POW!! You 
have just received an invitation to 
visit us at the Prpvost'S office, 
RSVP Ernie Mort. I'm glad to say 
that most of our cases are minor 
and easily reconciled, however 
there have been a few cases that 
have been preny hairy. We won't 
go into those cases, suffice to say 
that one of the policies we uphold 
is confidentiality. Our main 
concern is that everyone deserves 
a fair hearing and is given an 
opportunity to defend 
themselves. Revelle College 
Council selects the members of 
the committee during Spring 
quarter and we are oriented to 
due process, Univeristy rules and 
regulations, and general hearing 
procedures .. 

But enough of the boring st~£f. 
Currently, the committee has 
been working to improve the 
problem of academic dishonesty 
on this campus. Unfortunately, 
we see more cases of academic 
dishonesty than we care to admit. 
In contacting the faculty and in 
encouraging them to adopt 
preventative measures, we hope 
to solve half of the problem. The 
other half, that of the students, is 
not as easy to resolve. Cheating, 
plagiarizing, cop ing or whatever 
you want to calFit, is a ~rious 
offense . Ther a~ severe 
disciplinary sanctions that may 
be imposed on students for 
academic dishonesty, sanctions 
that could ruin a student'S future . 
We have the power to 
recommend suspension , 
dismissal, or expulsion to the 
appropriate authorities. Our aim 
is to improve the consciousness 
of the student and warn them of. 
the potential repercussions of 
academic dishonesty. There are 
other non-academic disciplinary 
cases which come before us that 
warrant severe sanctions, but 
none occur as often as cheating. 

On a lighter note , the 
comminee offers a chance for 
students to have a hearing of their 
peers rather be processed 
through adminstrative channels. 
Often times, our hearings deal 
with student initiated 
complaints. Granted we are a 
body serving Revelle College, but 
we also are here for the students 
who feel that their rights have 
been violated . Roommate 
difficulties, pranksters that get 
out of hand, and stolen parking 
permits, we get them all. So next 
time you feel an injustice has 
been done, look to us, we're the 
ones with the "funny black robes" 
and "white curly wigs" on .

Important Academic News 
"Incomplete" grades: 

The grade "I" may be assigned to a student's work when the 
work is passing quality, but is incomplete for good cause (illness, 
for example). You must receive instructor approval (may be 
instructor initiated in the case oCan emergency) on the "Request 
to Receive Grade Incomplete" form prior to the final 
examination period in any quaner in which you expect to 
receive the "I" grade. An "I" may be replaced upon completion of 
the work required by a date agreed upon with the instructor, but 
not later than the last day of finals week of the follOWing quarter. 
If not replaced by this date, the "I" grade wiD lapse into into a 
permanent "F' grade. The "I" grade shall be disregarded in 
determining a student's GPA 
Important Date!! 

March 7 - Final day to drop classes' without penalty of "F' 
grade. 

You would probably be best served if you do not wait until the 
last day to drop any courses. In the past, students that have 
waited for the last day have encountered long lines at the 
registrar's office, not to mention incurring the responsibility of 
not making it in time to drop the course (regardless of sickness, 
car problems, etc.). Remember that no drop cards will be 
accepted after 'Friday March 7 at 4:00 pm. 
Language Proficiency Exams: 

The language proficiency exams will be given at the end of the 
winter quaner as follows: 

French , German, Russian, and Spanish - the 
examination will be given Saturday March 15, 1986 at 9:00 
ar:n , in USB 2722. 

The language proficiency oral interview will be given at the end 
of the winter quaner on Tuesday and Wednesday of final 
examination week, March 18 and ' 19, 1986. Students should 
sign up at the Language Center Office, P&'L 2125, during the 
ninth and tenth weeks for BOTH the reading and oral portions 
of the examination. 

Students wishing to schedule language proficiency exams in 
languages other than French, German, Russian, or Spanish, can 
make arrangements with Ed Wa<!e in the Revelle Provost's 
Office.

Keep watching for deadlines 

It's eighth week, and like everyone else, you're probably trying 
make sense of the near and distant future. Let me make a few 
suggestions. Of course, there is always the question, "What 
should I do this weekend?" Hopefully, if you haven't already, 
you'll decide to make an appearance at Revelle's own Semi-
Formal to be held at the beautiful new Marriott Hotel, tomorrow 
night, 9 pm-lam. Purchase your tickets at the Box office or on 
the plaza between 11 am and 1 pm, just $8 per person. 

In terms of next quarter, you've probably already decided on 
your new schedule. But have you made a decision where you're 
~oing to spend your extra time and energy next year? Well if you 
1ave an interest in Revelle Student Government, maybe you 
should consider running for Revelle College Council (RCC). If 
you would like to have a voice and a vote in decisions made 
concerning Revelle policy, then RCC is a good group to get 
involved with. 

All you need to run for RCC is to be a Revelle student with a 
GPA of 2.0 or above and that you have a genuine interest in 
being df!dicated to Revelle and in serving your school. The filing 
period for applications starts March 10 and ends March 31 at 
noon. Pick up your application from Karen Peters at the Revelle 
Provost's Office .
