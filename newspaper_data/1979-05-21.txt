Third Provost Watson 

Joe Watson: 
Students 
'Lucky'to 
Get a Vote 

By John Hondros 
AJ90ciale Ne,n Jo~dhor 

" Students should feel lucky 
they have the right to vote at 
all" for the permanent name of 
Third -CGllele, Third Provost 

Jo~eph Watson told The 
Guardian yesterday . 

" It would be a lot more 
effici ent to ha ve Third College 
a dministra tors vote on the 
na me," W at on said. 

Watson ma de his remarks in 
anger over a n editorial on the 
Third naming process which 
a ppea red in The Guardian last 
Friday. 

According to council member 
Sung Choe, only 103 of the 1660 
Third students voted on last 
week's naming ballot. Of those 
who did vo te , 70 percent 
supported retaining the name 
of the college as " Third ," while 
30 percent were for " Martin 
Luther King," sa id Choe. 

The name Third will appear 
on the final yes/no ballot next 
week. . 

Based on the results of the 
first preference ballot. Third 
received the most support from 
the small percentage of 
students, faculty and staff that 
voted , and Lumumba-Zapata 
and Sequoyah were also 
popular selections. However, 
the council placed Martin 
Luther King, which was fourth 
overall in popularity, along 
with Third on the second ballot. 
Lumumba-Zapata and Se-
quoyah were eliminated as 
ballot choices because the 
council considered them 
.. inappropriate. ,. 

"The council never said it 
would use the numerical results 
of tfl e ballot as its main 
resource," said Watson. 

Choe attribute the low 
voting turnout to the fact that 
" the administrators have not 
been cooperative" in the past 
nCiming efforts . 

"This is the third time that 
the students are voting for a 
name . " said Choe . " The 
admini tration has never 
endorsed the student's choice: 
thi is the major factor that has

Regents Delay Weapons Item 
Unready for Brown Move; Anti-Apartheid Pressure on GM Passes

A N FRA N C I CO 
lai ming they know too li ttle 

a bou t t he Unive r it y of 
a li fo rnia' re la tion hip with 

two nuclear weapons develop-
m ent labora torie , the Boa rd 
of Regents voted Friday to 
de lay until July considera tion 
of a motion by Governor Jerry 
Brown to sever UC's ties with 
the Livermore and Los 
Ala mos, N.M. la bs . 

The Regents a lso voted to 
ask General Motors not to sell 
a ny parts, vehicles, or provide 
services to the South African 
police and military, the first 
time the Regents have ever 
bucked management policy 
on any shareholder 's resolu-
tion. 

Regent William Coblentz's 
motion to take the weapons 
lab matter up in July passed 
by an 11-9 vote to the jeers of 
about 50 demonstrators in the 
UC Extension Center Audi-
toriwn. 

Amongthosesupponungtbe 
motion was Lt . Governor 
Mike Curb, and included in 
those voting no were Brown 
and Assembly Speaker Leo 
McCarthy , who said he 
supports UC severing ties 
with the la bs . 

After the meeting ad-
journed, Brown told reporters 
that he " will have the votes in 
due time" to break the 
Unive rsity's contract with the 
Department of Energy. He 
quickly added, though, that he 
did not think the Regents 
would have voted to sever 

. Friday, and that they may not 
do so in July either. 

" The University has to act 
as a prophet and as a 
teacher," Brown sa id . " I 
think that role can be 
discharged better without this 
contract with the Federal 
Government and the DOE. 

But Brown also cautioned 
that " it will be a while before 

the niversity evers" it ties 
with the lab . 

In a press conference 
Friday , UC Pre ident David 
Saxon, claiming tha t "the 
la bo r a t o r ie p rform a 
function the ove rwhelming 
majority of elected repre-
senta tive a nd the President 
view as essential ," said he 
will do no " arm twisting 
between now a nd July among 
the Regents. 

Governor Brown 
Comparing the manage-

ment of the labs to police and 
military service, Saxon added 
that "just because no one 
wants to do them does not 
mean they should not be 
done." 

Outside the auditorium'anti-
nuclear .activist Daniel 
ElIsberg told 100 protestors 
that Saxon " cannot di -
tinguish his role from that of 
two other institutions - the 
police and the military. 

"Perhaps hi name should 
be Prussian, not Saxon, " 
Ellsberg added. 

In another significant 
development Friday , the 
Regents voted 15-3 to ask 
General Motors to refrain 
from selling vehicles or spare 
parts or provi~ing services to 
the South African police and

Department of Energy 
Urges Continued UC-
Radiation Lab Ties 

By Kathy Huffer 
and Doug Campion 

While California 's Governor 
Brown announced last week 
that the University of 
California should sever its ties 
with the Lawrence Livermore 
and Los Alamos scientific 
laboratories , a federal study 
released less than two weeks 
ago favored a continuation of 
the university's weapons and 
non-weapons research. 

Because of VC ' s past 
evaluations of its relationship 
to the two labs, the Department 
of Energy (DOE) felt it was 
necessary for the government 
also to take a look at the tJC-

perated labs , Assistant ' 
Secretary of Energy Duane 
Sewell told the Guardian last 
week. 

Sewell, who met with the 
Regents in San Francisco last 
week, said he was pleased with 
the study 's results although it 
had been compiled hurriedly. 

Last January an ad hoc 
committee set up by the Energy 
Rese a rch Advisory Boa rd 
(ERAB) began an investi-
gation of the weapons labs at 
the request of Secretary of 
Energy James R. Schlesinger. 

After several months ' study, 
the committee concluded that 
" the past arrangements 
between the University and the 
laboratories have served the 
nation and the laboratories 
welL " 

Citing an " independence of 
thought " unique to the 
university-operated labs and 
the labs ' early identification of 
a need for weapons safety, the 

study praised the university'E 
management of the labs. 

Non-Weapons, Too 
Originally under the 

jurisdiction of the Office of 
Scientific Research and 
Development , both the 
Livermore and Los Alamos 
la bs have as their main mission 
the production of nuclear 
weapons for the Federal 
Government. The labs are now 
run by the UC for the 
Department of Energy. 

Founded in 1952 , the 
Li vermore lab has expanded on 
the technology pioneered by its 
UC Berkeley progenitor, the 
4awr~D~ Radiation . L.abo[a-
tory. Both labs were named in 
honor of physicist Ernest O. 
Lawrence, inventor of the 
cyclotron and first director of 
the Berkeley lab. 

Construction began on the 
Los Alamos facility late in 1942 
to provide a location for field 
experimentation and te ting of 
theories developed by UC 
Berkeley physicist J . Robert 
Oppenhe ime r a nd hi col-
leagues. In Janaury , 1943, the 
government selected the UC to 
operate the laboratory. 

The earliest work at Los 
Alamos was aimed a t 
producing the first nuclear 
warhead , research code-
named the Manhattan Project. 
Scientists at the labs have since 
developed the nuclear system I 
for every atomi c - weapon 
owned by the United States, 
including the Atlas , Titan I, 
Minuteman, Lockheed C-4, and 
other missile .

Black Unity Can 
End Racism: Karenga 

By Steve Schneider

Black unity and the assertion 
of the Black culture could 
overcome racism in the U.S., 
Dr. M. Ron Karenga, professor 
at Cal State Los Angeles , told a 
gathering here Friday night 
honoring the late Malcolm X. 

Speaking on the topi c 
" Malcolm X and Social 
Change: Toward a Strategy for

crowd of about 100 that 
Malcolm X was "one of the 
greatest men of our time." 

Malcolm X, the civil rights 
activist and advocate of Black

Bottle Push Kills 
Babies Overseas 

The Guardian Mon., May 21. 1979 

Opinion 

Formula Sellers Use Third World 
Editor: 

Over the last three years there has been rising concern over 
the "bottle-boom" in Third World countries. The practice of 
feedJq babies has created a controversy. At the center of this 
are the questionable promotional operations of companies such 
as Brlatol-Myers, Wyeth and Nestle. 'l'hese companies are 
promotlng the sale of powdered milk as a substitute for 
mother's milk. The sale of this product to mothers who do not 
have the facilities to properly prepare the fonnula is, in~eed, a 
deadly way to make a profit. 

Over thirty years ago in the United States, companies 
producing powdered baby formula started a mass advertising 
campallD directed specifically toward "expectant mothers." 
Women were warned that their breasts would lose their shape if 
they breastfed, and were told that formula feeding would insure 
the fact that their babies would receive all the necessary 
nutrients which the mother might not be able to supply. 

Powdered formula was also sold as a route to liberation. The 
mother didn't have to be tied to her baby . Someone else could 
feed him with a bottle. What the corporations didn't say, as they 
sold liberation in the form of a bottle, is that breastfed babies 
are sick leu often and have fewer allergies. 

Since their promotional tactics worked so well in the U.S., the 
companies started their campaigns in the Third World 
countries. As one can imagine, the affluence and prestige of 
uaiq American products became a major factor in converting 
the breast feeding mothers of the Third World' countries to 
bottle feeding. 

Neatle started circulating "Baby Care" booklets. These 
booklets would reach the poor through distribution in maternity 
wards of public hospitals, clinics, milk banks, and doctor's 
offices. The pamphlets contained information about infant care 
and reasons to use the powdered formula. The propaganda was 
intended to reach the mothers before they gave birth . The facts 
were meant to implant doubts in the women's minds about their 
ability to breastfeed, in order to have them start their child on 
fOnTluia before breast-milk was given a chance. 

Recent International criticism by nutritionists and various 
U.S. public interest groups have caused promotions to be toned 
down. In response to the rising tide of protest against the 
promotion of baby formula in Third World countries, formula 
manufacturers now claim they are reducing thelDmass media 
advertisiq. But to replace this technique, Nestle donated large 
quantities of their formula to ,sh, Third World governments, 
and the countries' hospitals. Nestle's gifts of formula samples 
provide the government with a short-run solution (bottle-
feeding) to a long-term problem, (declining breast feeding and 
increasing infant mortality). Rather than putting more 
revenues into doctors and hospital staff to encourage breast-
feeding, the government allows the hospitals to become 
distributors and thus promoters of Nestle baby formula . 

The powdered formula has satisfied the majority oC its users 
in the U.S., but not in the Third World countries. The mortality 
rate has risen severely and it stems from many reasons. The 
use of infant formula requires sanitary water, bottles and 
nipples. Lacking these conditions, the formula can become a 
deadly transmitter of severe bacterial infections leading to 
diarrhea, dehydration and death. Moreover, infant formula is 
relatively expensive, so the mothers dilute it to make it last 
longer. 

When breast feeding was widespread among the poor, 
malnutrition usually did not become severe until the second

Letters to the Editor 

Rec Vote to Cut Crowds 
Editor: 

Historically, the University 
of California has supported the 
construction, maintenance and 
operation oC extra-curricular 
facilities through Instructional 
and Research funds (so-called 
State monies) , registration fees 
(so-called student monies) and 
private donations . The 
economic climate that has 
characterized the state during 
recent years has forced the 
construction of these type of 
facilities to be borne entirely by 
student monies and/or private 
donations. Furthermore, as 
funds have become scarce, . 
registration fees have been 
unable to allocate sufficient 
reserves for the construction of 
major recreational facilities , 
and at least one other UC 
campus has asked for direct 
student subsidy for a facility. 

At UCLA, a student vote 
(May 3-4 , 1978) approved the 
construction of the John 
Wooden Sports and Recreation 
Complex. The approval 
requisites were set at a 
minimum 20 percent turnout 
(actual 22 . percent) and 55 
percent affirmative votes 
(actual 73.2 percent). One other 
campus, UC Santa Cruz, is now 
planning a referendum for a 
swimming pool built by a 
specific student fee. 

UCSD was initially con-
ceptualized as evolving into a 
major UC campus, equal in size 
and scope to UCB and UCLA, 
eventually numbering 25,006-
30,000 students in 12 colleges 
served by three cluster 
facilities as well as other 
centralized facilities . The 
current physical education, 
recreation and intercollegiate 
facilities were constructed as 

part of the Cluster One 
complex: demographics and 
economics now unchanged for 
the foreseeable future . UCSD 
now contains four full-sized 
colleges, as well as the Medical 
School and Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography. This macro-
cluster population and the 
recent tremendous emphasis 
on physical fitness and 
recreation activities have 
placed constraints on the 
availability of the current 
fllcilities for student use and 
have led to long waiting lines 
for open swimming, intramural 
contests scheduled up through 
midnight , racquetball players 
gOing oCf-campus in order to 
reserve desirable playing 
times , priority .. discussions" 
held between basketball , 
volleyball , and badminton 
players, and other evidence of 
serious overcrowding. 

Throughout 1977-78 , a 
student-dominated committee, 
with student representatives 
from all major campus units, 
met weekly to study the needs 
of students for recreational 
facilities: the recommen-
dations forwarded from this 
committee cited the critical 
need for additional facilities 
and a direct student Â·Â· assess-
ment as the only positive 
mechanism for securing 
necessary funds . As a response 
to this report, student 
representatives met at least 
once weekly from September, 
1978 on for the express purposes 
of ana lysis and initiation, 
coordination and implemen-
tation of the referendum 
question before you now. Great 
care and detailed research 
went into the 'report from the ' 
1977-78 committee and into the 

preparation for this refer-
endum . Throughout the entire 
process, many students and 
professional consultants 
devoted precious time and 
effort to insure that student 
needs and desires were mel. 
The facilities listed in the 
referendum question are those 
which all surveys and polls 
indicated were in most critical 
demand. Recent surveys of 
utilization of recreation 
facilities indicate very little 
relief short of use during the 
early morning hours . 

This referendum question 
has been initiated, planned, and 
proposed solely by students in 
support of student interest, 
albeit with full professional 
support (site approval, budget 
analyses , student alfair 
matters, etc) . Various positive 
arguments (other than the 
obvious documented one of 
critical need) art! delineated 
here for your perusal : 

l. The construction will be 
completed with no trees 
eliminated. Solar energy and 
natural ventilation reduce 
cnsts and external energy 
dependence. 

2. The quarterly assessment 
will not begin until completion 
of construction/occupancy of 
these facilities . Hence, you will 
only pay for the facilities 
available for use. 

3. This project will not acrect 
the registration fee portion of 
your student fees. 

4. Students on financial aids 
will not be personally assessed 
this extra fee inasmuch as the 
financial aids package includes 
all required fees . 

5. There will be no additional

Regent Election a Big Issue 
Editor: 

Your recent coverage of the 
ASUCSD election results made 
little or no mention to one of the 
most significant issues to ever 
be presented to students in the 
history of this school.::: 

I am referring to l1ie ballot 
que tion re: the democratic 
election of the Regents: passed 
by 78 percent of those voting, 
thi ' was no idle sampling of 
student opinion . Rather it 
represents a mandate from the 
student body . directin, the AS 
government to lobby for a 
sy tem-wide election on all nine 
campu es of the UC . The 

question is "should the Regents 
of the UC be democratically 
elected rather than appointed 
to 12-yea r terms by the 
governor of the state ?" 

Shouldn 't the Regents, as the 
governing body of a mighty 
educational resoUrce. be a 
cOuple of steps clo er to the 
PEOPLE of the state ? As 
citizens we have a rieht to see 
that the Univer ity is 
administered by individua l 
who are free of invisible 
political influence : as 
taxpayers we have a right to 
ee th<lt the University is m<lde 

to serve the publi c good 
(spelled " education ") instead 

of the research interests of 
private corporations (spelled 
" profie). If the tudents of all 
nine campuses cast their votes 
together we may ecrect~ a 
movement toward the demo-
cra tic election of the Regents, 
ei ther by a state ballot 
proposition or legi lative 
action. 

Those of you who support thi 
pu h fo'l" democracy in 
education arc invited to spe<lk 
out now so that our new student

Campus' Oldest Building Getting Work 
Scripps Memorial Lab, 
Oldest Campus Building, 
Closed for Renovation 

By Teresa Tokar 
SI.3H Wriler 

The George H. Scripps 
Memorial Laboratory, which 
was closed during the summer 
of 1977 for safety reasons, will 
be refurbished and opened for 
use agai n if the necessary funds 
become available. 

According to Fred Spiess, 
chairman of both the fund 
raising committee and the 
Building Advisory Committee 
for renovating the Scripps 
building, the Cull , detailed 
.. architectural and engineering 
plans are just about complete." 

The renovation of the 
building will be conducted in 
two phase . Phase One, in 
which the building will be 
strengthened and reinforced 
and the exterior of the building 
fixed up , is due for completion 
by the end of this year. John 
Henderson , architect in charge 
of renovation , aid that 
building codes have changed 
since the building's original 
construction. " In 1909, when 
the building was built, there 
was little consideration for 
earthquakes," he said. 

The secondlpha e will consist 
oi the remainder of the wor 
such as painting, electricit 
plumbing , telephones , Cire 
alarms and special facilities Cor 
the handicapped. Phase Two's 
completion date is unknown at 
this time and is " dependent on 
funding ," said Henderson. 

the oldest oceanographic 
building in the United States. It 
is also the first permanent 
structure of Scripps and the 
entire VCSD campus: "this is, 
where it all began," declares a 
flyer published by the Old 
Scripps Committee. 

The lab was also the 
headquarters of Scripps from 
1909 to 1951 , and housed the only 
classrooms at Scripps until 
1955 . The lab was used 
continuously until its closure in 
1977, and had been the 
workplace of marly noted 
scientists, such as Roger 
Revelle and eleven members of 
the atio nal Academy of 
Sciences. 

Spiess said that the entire 
renovation project should cost 
about $400,000. So far, $130,000 
has been raised through gifts 
from individuals, private 
foundations and corporations. 
In addition, the fund raising 
committee has received $50,000 
from federal historic preserva-
tion funds . The committee has 
applied for further funding 
(rom that office and has 
appealed to other private 
foundations for additional belp. 

Although the UC Regents 
approved the renovation plans 
for the Old Scripps Building, 
they did not ma ke allocations in 
their budget to help restore the 
building. However, Spiess is 
confident that enough money 
will be raised to complete the 
entire project.

When the Old Scripps 
Laboratory was constructed in 
1909, it was to become the first 
permanent seaside laboratory 
for marine biological studies in 
the western hemisphere, and

year of a child's life. But the decline of breast feeding over the 
past years has caused the average age of children suffering 
from severe forms of malnutrition to drop from eighteen to 
eight months in these Third World countries. This age drop is 
critical because of the potential effects of malnutrition on brain 
development in the first year of life. estle's standard reply is 
to deny any intent to cause these tragedies. They say they sell a 
good product and can't be held responsible for mi use by 
consumers. 

Why should Nestle persuade mother in developing nations 
into buying a product which they can 't afford, is unneces ary 
and is actually jeopardizing the health of their babie ? The 
replacement of mother'S milk is becoming a major cause in the 
movement (or corporate responsibility throughout the world. 
Nestle should not be allowed to exploit these countries and 
cause their infant mortality rate to rise. They are using these 
women and children to make a prom. People as members of a 
world SOCiety should support the boycott of estle products. to 
stop the sale of Ne tie formula in Third World countries.

Male physicians may be 
" unconsciously" giving more 
tests a nd more extensive 
examinations to their male 
pa tient than to their female 
pa tients . though this may not 
co nstitute superior medical 
care. a UCSD Medical S hool 
researcher has found. 

Dr. Lawrence Schneiderman 
studied 181 physician . all of 
whom are male, and found that 
the doctors tended to give more 
laboratory tests and exa mined 
more physiological sys tems 
when their patients were men. 

Schneiderman examined the 
charts of 52 couple who had 
been under a specific doctor's 
care for a number of years and 
looked at the lists o( tes ts and 
how muc h information the 
doctor recorded on the chart. 

In contrast to this , Schneider-
man found that if the patients' 

charts were matched against 
what the researchers con-
sidered a "good" examination. 
there was no difference in the 
treatment of men and women 
patients. 

Schn iderman said he was 
"quite sure" that the dirference 
in treatment was not inten-
tional. adding that the doctors 
in the tudy weI' selected for 
their excellence. 

According to Schneiderman. 
the most likely hypothe i to 
explain the re ults is that the 
physicians perceive the men to 
be "more toic" and thewomen 
. 'more hypochondriacal." Thi 
could lead, he said to the 
doctors la king more seriously 
the complaints of the men 
p atient and therefore 
administering more tests and 
procedure . 

Schneiderman a lso said that 
women patients tend to see 
their doctors more often than

eas ier for the doctors to 
remember the women's 
medical history a nd requiring 
thutless has to be written on the 
charts. 

Schneiderman said he did the 
study because "we were aware 
of claims by women lhatthey 
were getting unfair treat-
ment." We decided to explore 
this in a group of good 
physicians, he said. 

Many of the doctors in the 
study were impressed that the 
bia s cou ld be detected , 
Schneiderman suid and he feels 
that the doctor will work to 
eliminate the bia in treatment. 

Although research of' this 
type is not heav ily funded. 
there are stil l questions 
Schneiderman would like to 
examine. Among these is 
whether female phy icians 
have a bias in th e quantity and 
quality of treatment they give.

US Health C'are is 'Near Breakdown' 
By Dail St. Claire Bacon 

Starr Writer 
The health care industry is "a 

lot c lo se r to hav-ing a 
breakdown than you think. 
Richard Walden, a publi c 
interest lawyer specializin~ in 

health warned last week . 
Walden . addre ing a group 

of San Diego health advocate 
on current issues in health care 
legislation focused on the 
Torres bill (AR 1388) , which 
will regulate hospital budgets. 

Former .Angola Station Chief 

Ex-Spook Stockwell 
Speaking Tomorrow 

The man who coordinated the 
U.S. covert involvement in 
Angola during 1975-76 will talk 
about that effort in a noontime 
discussion from the gym steps 
tomorrow. 

John Stockwell was 36 years 
old and had just come out of the 
Vietnamese up-country when 
his CIA superiors offered him 
the "honor" of leading the 
Angola task force, the task 
force that would direct the 
CIA's involvement in a war 
which would restore the 
CIA prestige. It was a chance to 
affect war policY and carry it 
out , and Stockwell , still 
idealistic after 10 years with 
"the agency," took the job. 

According to Stockwell ' s 
book, In Searcb of Enemies, the 
experience of running a covert 
war led to disillusionment and 
to his 1977 resignation. 

Flylead comments include: 
" Though no American troops 

Boycott 
NestleÂ® 
Support the boycott 
of these 
Nestle products: 

were com mitted to Angola , 
only' advisors,' many million 
were spent, many thousands 
died, and many lies were told to 
the American people, in waging 
a war without purpo e to 
American vital interests and 
without hope or victory." 

The book contains not only 
details of CIA operations, but 
argues that the clandestine 
service of the CIA should be 
abolished. 

Rai se d by mi ss ionary 
parents in Africa, Stockwell 
attended the University of 
Texas and served in the Marine 
Corps before joining the CIA in 
1965. 

As a CIA operative, he served 
three tours in Africa, one at 
headquarters and one in 
Vietnam before accepting the 
Angola assignment. 

Stockwell's visit is sponsored 
by Third College and ASUCSD.

The Torres bill "forces public 
scrunity on hospital expen-
diture ,. by putting the annual 
hospital budget under control of 
the California Health Facili-
ties Commission, according to 
Walden. 

Currently , the commis ion 
acts as a reporting ystcm for 
hospitals, compiling info/Â·maÂ· 
tion on the financial condition of 
each and forecasting hospital 
trends . This information is then 
publicized to onsumer groups 
and health agen ie . 
Taxe Cover Overexpcnditures 

Wald n said that public 
money pay for hospital 
overexpenditures . " For every 
empt hospital bed, they get 
paid through taxe an av rage 
of $30,000 per bed because they 
figure it into their overhead 
costs," said Walden. The legal 
fees a nd money spent for 
lobbyists are also figured into 
this overhead clause, he added. 

Fifty-four percent of hospita l 
funds come from tax dollars, 
s ia d Walden. Since rising 
hospital costs have escalated 
sharply in the past five years , 
"something must be done to 
con trol this inflation ," he 
added. 

The Torres bill will make all 
hospitals report their budget 
for the next fiscal year 120 days 
in advance. If the budget does 
not receive com mi ssio n 
approval, the hospital will be 
able to draw up another budget. 
If the budget isn 't approved the 
second time, the Commission 
will devise and enforce a 
budget for them . 

" The Torres bill would give

A lawsuit which California 

Rural Legal Assistance 
(CRLA) is attempting to bring

California in Alameda County 
Superior Court has been 
postponed until June 11th . 

CRLA, representing " farm-
workers whose livelihood is 
threatened by the University,

reform organization, " seeks an 
injunction "prohibiting the 
University from engaging in

order that the University 

" provide retraining and relief

The postponement of the 
hearing was requested by 
CRLA because of " problems 
with scheduling" according to 
Tim McCarthy, a CRLA 
attorney . He added that this 
sort of thing " happened a lot." 
But CRLA is serio us ly 
committed to the agribusiness

Music/Pat Domowitz 

Stars Play Here for Baha'i, Not Money 

Film/Beth Accomando 

'Dead' Brings Laughs, Chills 
F ans of blood a nd gore have usually had to resort to the midnight 

movies in order to find films 
that would satisfy their unique 
tastes. Well , now George 
Romero, the master of this 
"werewolf circuit" with his cu lt 
classic Night of the Living Dead 
and Martin, has broken into the 
commercial mainstream with 
Dawn of the Dead, Dawn of the 
Dead, specifically a imed at a 
horror-loving audience, is a 
successfully bizarre blend of 
explicit gore arid black humor. 

Dawn of the Dead actually 
picks up where Romero's low-
budget, black and white Night 
of the Living Dead left off (for 
those interested , Romero 
already has a third sequel in the 
works). In Dawn of tbe Dead, 
Romero wastes no time with a 
slow build-up, but rather 
immediately catapults the 
audience into a world that is 
being taken over by canni-

balistic zombies. The film 
centers on four protagonists: a 
woman , her pilot boyfriend, a 
black cop and a white cop, and 
in this age of minority 
consciousness the woman and 
the black are the only ones 
given any intelligence. These 
four flee to a shopping ma ll 
where they attempt to survive 
the zombies and an attack by a 
motorcycle gang. 

Rom ero's scri pt is the 
weakest e lement in the film : it 
contains an erratic plot that 
wa nes in the middle and 
dialogue (a lot of "oh my God" 
or "what' ll we do, they're 
everywhere" comments) cou ld 
have been lifted from any 
horror film . Romero is also a 
bit skimpy about why and how 
the zombies came to exist; 
what little explan'atory 
information there is , is 
conveyed via TV interviews 
which occur sporadically 
throughout the film. 

"Dawn of tbe Dead," son of "Night of tbe Living Dead," falls 
under the masterful direction of George Romero. Definitely not 

". 

Romero , however , does 
succeed ' th his insrured 
directing. He opens the film 
with a conventional horror 
style: suspenseful music, shots 
of tense faces and bursts of 
graphic vio lence. He then 
supplants t hi s familiar 
approach with a perversely 
humorous one: carnival-type 
music, pie fights and social 
satire. Romero gives his film a 
satiric edge by having the 
zombies co nverge on the 
shoppi ng mall in a kind of 
pilgrimage to what had been 
the center of their lives. The 
zombies' aimless paci ng in the 
mall is like a ritualistic homage 
to what they once were, and 
what the protagonists still are. 
The four humans, even amidst 
the chaos, remain so materi-
alistic that they risk their lives 
to raid the department stores. 
In fact , some scenes look like a 
bizarre parody of a month end 
sale. 

The zombies too become a' 

. comic element. The zombie 
nuns, nurses and Hare 
Krishnas may' partake in 
cannibalistic attacks, but by' 
the film's end they ha ve 
become moronic clowns as they 
lumber through the mall to the 
sound of a music box score. 

What Romer-o has succeeded 
in doing is to create a perverse 
comedy of the grotesque: he 
tickles your funny bone as he 
sends chills .uP your spine . . 

Dawn of the Dead, however, 
is not for everyone. Although 
the gore grows less scary 
as the film progresses , 
the squeamish should be 
forewarned that Romero 
a nd special effects man 
Tom Savini deliver graphic 
scenes of disembowel-
ment, decapitation and can ni-
balism. Unsqueamish horror 
fans , though , should find the 
film a success. Dawn of the 
Dead is playing at UTC. 

for the squeamish, "Dead" Is now playing at Mann's University 
Towne Center tbeatres. â€¢ 

England Dan and 
John Ford Coley 
Friday at Revelle 
In Free Show 

I t's not that often that an act with a best-selling 
single will play coffee 

house gigs for free, unless 
there's something else in it for 
them. 

For England Dan and John 
Ford Coley, whose "Love is the 
Answer," from their Dr. 
Heckle a nd Mr. Jive , has 
already hit No. 17 on the 
Billboard Magazine chart, tbe 
trade-off is an opportunity to 
share their philosophy with 
UCSD students when they play 
Friday at 8 pm in Revelle 
Cafeteria. The free concerti 
discussion is one in a series of 
events sponsored in a " Week of 
Proclamation" by t.he UCSD 
Baha'i Club. 

The Friday performance will 
be sort of a busman's holiday 
for Dan Seals and John Coley-
who are in the middle o( a short 
break between promotional 
tours for Dr. Heckle and M.r. 
Jive .. 

" We just came off a six-week 
tour," Coley said in a phone 
interview from his No rth 
County home. "We'll go o"ck 
out for two months in about two 
or three weeks." 

During the layover, the duo 
will play UCSD Friday, then 
host an afternoon musical 
offering at the Encinitas-
Leucadi a-Cardiff Spring 
Flower Festival May 28. 

" Friday night won' t really be 
a concert," Coley said. " It ' ll be 
more of a proclamation where 
we'll talk about the Baha' i 
faith . Dan and I will sing and 
play acoustic guitars, and so 
will Leslie and Kelly (Bulldn-
two sisters who (requently tour 
with Seals and Coley) and Bob 
Gundry (a composer-musician 
who also tours with the act and 
wrote several o( the songs on 
the new album) . 

" We' ll sing first , then talk 
afterward, because," Coley 
said, " not everyone will want 
to hear about the faith. And 
we ' re not proselytizing, we' re 
just providing information. I'm 
sure, though, that most of the 
people who come for the music 
will come because they want to 
hear about Baha'i (aith." 

Coley and Seals, the brother 
of Jim Seals (Seals and Crofts) , 
were introduced to the teaching 
of Baha 'u ' lIah , the Bahai 
prophet, shortly after their 
arrival in California from 
~exas abvut nine years ago . 

" I was really irreligious; I 
thought religion wa useless, a 
tremendous joke," Cotey said. 
"Then when I hea rd about 
Baha'i, I immediately went out 
to try to find a way to disprove 
it. I thought religion was for the 
very young, the very old and the 
very weak. 

" I had a real Missouri 
attitude - you know, 's how 
me.' I Iried (or two years, but 
couldn ' t find the flaws," he 
mused. "They didn 't claim to 
have the only way, they didn't 
say that everyone else was 
wrong, like my Baptist 
background had.

'Bee Hive' Lively, But Recording Bad 
Liue ., t â€¢â€¢ Be. Hiue - Clifford 
Brown and Max Roach (Columbia) 

L ive at the Bee Hive is a wild and wooly docu-
ment of the excitement 

of the jam session. Recorded in 
a Chicago bar in 1955, Bee 
Hives's recording Quality 
leaves much to be desired from 
anyone's point of view: the 
sound is muddy and flat, there's 
an excess of surface noise, and 
the continual babble of 
customers ordering drinks and 
talking through the best solo 
moments are sn annoyance. 

Despite those things , Bee 
Hive ' s collective sound is 
lively, rambunctious and packs 
the punch of a chain-mail glove. 

The several extended forays 
of the late Clifford Brown are 
expeciallyexciting. Before his 
untimely death, Brown had 
established himse lf as possibly 
the premier trumpet player on 
any jazz scene, and this record, 
especially the workout on 
Sonny Stitt's " Cherokee," 
reminds us of his incandescent 
powers as a soloist. Clifford 
possessed a big, fat sound, and 
was a lternately lyrically 

sublime and frenetically rapid 
in his choice of note . Bee Hive 
is a handy display case of this 
man's billiance. 

The other players hold their 
own as well. The searing sax-
work 'of Sonny Rollins and 
Nicky Hill, the shimmering 
guitar of Lou Blevins and the 
pulsating time kept by pianist 
Billy Wallace and drummer 
Max Roach is featured. The 
ound of th e affair i 

occosionally rogged, but these 
things are remedied and the 
music proceeds , quickly 
regaining it momentum. In 
general , Bee Hive i a nice peek 
at the ki nd of jazz that does not 
get played much ,wymore. B 
plus.

the hallmark of the bop

Resistance Artist's Work Shown 
T he La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art is 

currently exhibiting a 
selection of "Druksels" prints 
and general printed matter by 
the late Dutch artist Hendrik 
Nicolass Werkman . Werkman 
combined his knowledge and 
skill as a painter and 
printmaker to create inno-
vative and often inspirational 
work. His printing techniques 
extend beyond conventional 
printing techniques, in that he 
employs a variety of instru-
ments. 'uch as hard rollers, 
stamp , stencils and elements 
of hand-presses to apply ink, He 
used the term " Druksels" to 
describe the unique prints that 
were a result of this process, 
Although much of the artist's 
work was destroyed by the 
Nazis, this exhibition organized 
by the Stedelijk Museum, 
Amsterdam, represents the 
largest accumulation of 
Werkman prints. 

Werkman, a member of the 
Resistance, was active in his 
involvement with The Blue 
Barge, an illegal publication 
that made commentaries on the 
events of the time . The 
publication served as an outlet 
against the persecution of the 
Jewish people. Inspired by the 
Hassidic legends , Werkman 
created poignant prints that. 
combined with written words, 
were reflective of the (aith and 
optimism of the Jewish 
Culture , Werkman's energy 
and enthusiasm for the project 
is conveyed in his own words; in 
referring to the legetJds, he 
said: "When I read such a story 
an image forms in my mind, 
which refuses to be driven 
away by any other ... For 
instance, when I read that 
lovely story " Triple Laughter" 
it makes me want to rush to the 
press - it is so full of imagery. " 
"The Enforced Return" and 
" The Journey to Jerusalem" 

reflect Werkman's use of flat 
simple shapes combined with 
primary colors to create a 
rhythmical and childlike 
composition , 

In the twenties Werkman 's 
innovative printing techniques 
paralleled avant-garde artists 
working in a variety of media. 
Werkman printed with objects 
from his direct urroundings , 
or used typography to create 
ambiguous and whimsical 
forms, much like the dadaist 
incorporation of found objects 
into collage. An exam~le of this 
technique can be secn in his 
print " Growing Laugh," in 
which typographical letters are 
used to form a whimsical 
image. Werkman published an 
avant-garde journal The Next 
Call, which contained Werk-
man 's typographical experiÂ· 
ments, Druksels and Expres-
sionistic, lyrical and Dadaist 
texts, which he exc hanged for 
other avant-garde correspon-

dences . Werkman lost faith in 
the international avant-garde 
and in Novemberof 1926 the last 
issue of The Next Call was 
published. 

"Hot Printing" character-
izes the printilfg techniques 
used by Werkman during the 
thirties , in which he combines 
the process of printing and 
creating into one step by 
printing the separate elements 
of a print one by one so as to 
build up the desired image on 
paper. SubjectÂ· of his prints 
during this time seem to Cloat in 
the composition and are not 
limited by the rigid geo-
metrical restrictions of 
working in a conventiona l 
method, 

In the spring of 1945 
Werkman was executed by the 
German police, 

The exhibition continues 
through May 27 in the Gordon 
Gray Lobby and Gallery 1. 

Stars Promise Good Time, Baha'i 
(Continued from pa~e 11) 
on unity. The individual has to 
investigate for himself - and 
it's not forced on anybody," 
Coley said. 

The nonproselytizing ap-
proach of Baha'i is reflected in 
the music that has taken 
England Dan and John Ford 
Coley to the brink of success -
it has in the past projected an 
image of soft pop, at lea t on 
record. 

"The new album marks a 
departure Crom that image for 
us," Coley said. "This is more 
rock'n ' roll than we 've recorded 
before. But we've been playing 
ilforyears. I guess w 're ort of 

musical schizophrenics, We 
play down and out rock and roll 
and soft ballads," 

The new album (on Big Tree 
Records) at times reflects that 
schizophrenia. The hit single, 
"Love is the Answer," was 
written by Todd Rundgren on a 
good day (obviously not when 
his hair was blue and pink) . It 
uses the word love no less than 
17 times, but a nice arrange-
ment by Gene Page and some 
very fine guitar work by master 
session man Lee Ritenour keep 
it from being mushy. 

Seals and Coley's harmonies 
lire tight. c lean and very choir-
boy pretty. 

The rest of the album has 
some bite to it, but seems 
strongly derivative. Hardest 
rocker on the disc is "Rolling 
Fever," written by Seals 
him elf. It 's a song about being 
on the road that would have I 
suited the early Eagles (like 
"Already Gone") . The title 
track, "Hollywood Heckle and 
Jive, " written by the duo, slides 
and swoops like a Jay Ferguson 
ong and has ome great lines 

like the chorus: 

Hollywood heckle and jiue 
The weaker surrender 
The stronger survive 

City of Angels won't you please 
Set me free. 
The music is generally a good 

paradigm for the performers 
themselves : polite, sincere, 
open and down-to-earth. 

Although Coley says Friday 
night's session won' t include 
much from the album, the 
music is likely to be similar in 
content if not form, and likely to 
fulfill the Baha ' i Club's 
intentions. 

"We want to give the campus 
a good time and let them know 
about our unity and love," said 
club Cbairman John Bruss.

Study Approves UC Weapons 'Role 
(Contlaaed from pale 1) 

Althou,h Initially all 
research at Los Alamos and 
Livermore was directed 
toward the production of 
nuclear w'eaponry , today 
"rOUlhly half of their work is in 
enerlY research," according to 
Don Shapero, executive 
director of the ERAB. 

At Los Alamos, " only 40 
. percent is weapons , but it is the 
main block," said Dr. Harold 
Agnew, former director of the 
New Mexico facility . 

Agnew sa id that of the $350 
million annual budget, about 
$20 million is dedicated to the 
meson phys ic fac ility , a 
medium -e nerg y pa rticle 
accelerator whi c h allows 
scientists to s tudy the nucleus 
of atoms more effectively, and 
which may have useful 
applications in medicine and 
industry. 

Approximately an equal 
amount is spent on the study 
and development of gas lasers 
for use in various experiments, 
and about $15 million goes 
toward research in geoscience, 
said Agnew. 

At Livermore , project 
Plowshare, which uses nuclear 
technology for peacetime 
purposes, has worked on using 
nuclear power in such 
undertakings as new methods 
of petroleum and natural gas 
discovery and large-scale 
earthmoving for canals. In 
1963, however, with the signing 
of the treaty banning nuclear 
weapons tests in the atmos-
phere, Plowshare operations 
were slowed. 

Scientists at both labs are 
also concerned with the 

biological effects of man-made 
radiation. In fact, at Los 
Alamos a Nuclear Safeguards 
program has been established 
to develop more sophisticated 
methods of keeping track of 
radioactive materials and to 
help prevent the illicit use of 
the substances . 

Much of the research at 
Livermore and at Los Alamos 
still concentrates on finding an 
effective and efficient means of 
producing nuclear fusion , a 
goal of the labora tories since 
their es tablishment. 

Unlike fi sion , the type of 
reaction employed in nuclear 
power plants today, in which a 
heavy e lement (uranium-235) 
splits to release energy a nd 
form two lighter e lements, 
fusion brings two light 
elements togeth e r a nd 
combines or " fuse .. them into 
a he a vier element , a lso 
releasing energy. 

As with much of the research 
carried out by the labs , 
concepts and developments in 
the field of fusion are 
communicated frequently 
between the facility in 
Livermore and that in New 
Mexico. 

Dr . Charles Browne , 
associate director at Los 
Alamos, feels that both labs 
have probably benefitted 
equally from their association 
with the UC, although he noted 
that "It's quite a bit easier to 
deal with a lab that 's 40 miles 
away than one that's 1500 miles 
away." . 

Not Perfect 
Although generally pleased 

with the labs ' operation, the 
ERAB committee found fault 

with the university in several 
instances and recommended 
that an alternate management 
arrangement be prepared in 
case UC chooses to discontinue 
its contractual relationship 
with the labs. 

The Regents should become 
more aware of the labs ' 
functions and need to become 
more familiar with adminis-
trative and other issues which 
affect the la bs, according to the 
study. 

The committee expla ined 
that the Regents may not be 
a bl e to choose effective lab 
director in the future if they do 
not become more familia r ized 
with th e requirements of the 
job. 

In a dd i tion , th e st ud y 
s ugge ted that the univer ity 
better support the la bs in the 
wa ke of growing public 
oppo ition to the resea rch and 
d e velopm e nt of nu c lea r 
weapons . 

Agnew remarked that he 
" really wasn 't happy with the 
university administration -
the president and vice 
president," in explaining his 
recent resignation from Los 
Alamos . Now president of 
General Atomic in La Jolla , 
Agnew said he "just gotCed up" 
with the lack of open UC 
support of the labs ' activities . 

According to Agnew , this 
lack of support during recent 
anti -weapons protests at 
several UC campuses resulted 
in the' development of a slight 
.. antagonism" within the lab. 

The UC's silence on the 
matter " was really worse than 
a condemnation" in some 
way s-, said Agnew . He

explained, "The people you ' re 
trying to hire are coming out of 
the university and have been 
sort bf 'cloned' to believe that 
academic research is a higher 
form of research than what 
goes on in industry." 

Without the endorsement of 
the university, then, Agnew 
said it became more difficult to 
attract qualified researchers. 

As a res ult of this diffi culty , 
the committee recommended 
tha the DOE begin planning a 
contingency m a nagement plan 
which could be implemented if 
UC e ncoun te r .. uff icient 
furthe r pressure" from both 
with i n a n d o u tside t he

developed, the DOE favors 
contracting with an exi 'ting 
non-profit corpora tion if UC 
dissolves its ties with the la bs, 
a ccording to Sewa ll. 

The committee ' re port 
called the chances of UC 
discontinuing opera tion of the 
labs " remote." But in light of 
Brown's opposing stance, the 
ERAB "must take it very 
seriously," commented Sewall. 

S~wall remarked that 
Brown 's statements on the 
weapons labs had caught the 
DOE by surprise. Although he 
hopes UC will renew its 
contract with the labs , " the 
Board (of Regents) will have to 
come to grips with that. " 

Officials from both labs 
indicated that most employees 
do not favor ending UC's 
operation of the labs . At the Los 

Alamos lab, " the employees 
will be most distressed when 
they learn of Brown ' s 
comments, " said Browne. 

A recent opinion survey 
conducted among the em-
ployees there showed that " a 
very large portion were quite 
satisfied (with UC's relation-
ship to the labs) ," according to 
Browne . 

Although mo t e mpl oyees 
would continue working at the 
Li ve rmore labs if C severed 
it ties with the two facilities,

se ntime n t among th em-
p loyees to con tin ue ( C's

May , di rector at large of the 
Livermore lab. 

Study Too Rushed 
While both the DO E a nd

committee tudy 's re.c; ult , at 
le a s t se ve r a l m e mb er of 
ERAB felt tha t in ufficient 
time ha d been put into the 
study . 

Although most of the ERAB 
approved the committee's 
findings , a minority of the 
boa rd members claimed tha t 
the study' s re s ult s were 
inconclusive due to the limited 
a mount of time s pent 
interviewing variou s :a b 
scientists, UC a dministrators 
and federal officials . 

Sewall said that the 
committee was hurried in its 
investigation of UC 's relation-
ship with t~e two labs. But 
" they had to spend their time 
expeditiously ... a nd they did 
that ," he commented .
