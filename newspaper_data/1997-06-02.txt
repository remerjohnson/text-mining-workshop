4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 
"' Monday, June 2, 1997 

. COMMENTARY: While most students attend college to be educated in classrooms and labs, many find that 
the most valuable .lessons are learned outside of the lecture haJI through experience. at the University of Life 

GRADUATE LEAVES FINAL WORDS OF 'WISDOM' 
., .... c:a.c 
Senior Staff ~ter 

A wise mentor, who has since 
passed away, said to me upon gradu-
ating from high school: 'The most 
important lessons you will learn in 
college wi II be out ide the classroom. 
Paradoxically, or maybe not so para-
doxically, it is -the fael that going to 
school and taking classes instead of 
working a full~time job will give you 
the freedom to learn and grow in 
ways that you would not be able to 
otherwise. Take the time outside of 
class to learn this. You' ll leave col-
lege with a beuer education." 

I've never forgotten it and I've 
learned he was right. 

I've had 23 satisfying yean; on 
this planet - some better than others. 
A few (only a few) were uneventful , 
peaceful years. Others were wracked 
with tunnoil and catastrophic rever-
sal of fortune that 'sent three of my' 
guardian angels into early retirement 
tn both .cases, I' ve extracted reward-
ing, if sonlCtirnes surprising, lessons 
thal allow me to weather even my 
darkest days in good spirits - and, in 
my best days, experience moments of 
synchl'(>llicity that seem to elude so 
many people all their lives. 

Lessons? Here they arc: 
1. a.... C D ....... IIIIII wIIdanI 
- ........ It 

Convlalltional wisdom is the set of 

common beliefs held by those too 
lazy and I1nimagina).ive to think inde-
pendenlly, who take cues from other 
lazy minds. By design, sehools make 
you leam from the past. Regardless 
of our majors, we arc all ultimately 

, tudying the hi t ry of our individual 
diseiplines. 

While there is much we can learn 
from "how it was done," innovation 
and genuine intellectual revolution 
comes from those who understand 
the status quo well enough to chal-
lenge it. Revolutionaries always ask 
"dumb questions" from their contem-
poraries' point of view; remember 
that it was Albert Einstein's question 
of whether light would have the same 
speed in all refere,nce points that 
turned Newtonian physics on its ear. 
In an age of accelerating change, time 
is on the side of the young. so learn 
the di scipline of lateral thinking, and 
challenge the status quo. 2."""',........, not 
"".1.111 

We constantly hear people who 
say they want to "be happy." Yet, few 
in pursuit of that will-o-the-wi p wi II 
lead genuine.ly satisfying lives. Why? 
Because happiness is temporary. an 
emolional response to good circum-
stances. Circumstances can change in 
lhe blink of an eye, and those who 
build their lives around Ihe random 
winds of fortune rarely become any-

thing of consequence. Seeking happi -
ness as an end in itself is like trying to 
build a machine whose only specifi-
cation is that it runs quietly. We 
shortchange outsel ves and ask 
too liltle from li fe . 

You know the drill : 
")' d be happy.if 

onl)' I had a job at 
Company X, if only 
I gOl into this or 
that medical! 
law/ grad uat e 
school. if only I 
married that per-
son, if .only I 
made X number 
of dollars a year." 

The beautiful 
house. The dream 
car. The prestigious 
job. The perfect 
relationship. Raising 
the idcal family. 
Gelling everything, we 
are told, is important. So 
we follow the other lem-
mings and climb the laddcr of 
success, only to find out 30 years 
later when we do reach the top that it 
was leaning against the wrong wall . 

How tragic. 
Fulfillment. on the other hand. is 

inflnitcly more subtle, deeply idio-
syncratic, unpredictably rewarding, 
and reflects the very best of our 

unique 
talents. There is 
a word in Chinese that beautifully 
captures the essence of fulfillment: 
)'uen. While there is no direct English 
translation. it can be loosely thought 

~.;-

of as the inter-

section between the 
words "fate," "chance," "destiny" 
and "opponunity."

• COMMENTARY: Instead of confronting serious political issues, liberals construct a facade of superiority 
with their own vocabulary that confuses, distorts and obfuscates the truths they refuse to recognize 

LIBERAL 'EDUCATION' DEFINED BY IGNORANCE 
By Chris Schr8lber 
EdittJr in Chief 

Anyonc who disagrces with a 
liberal is obviously a moron. At 
least, Ihat is the mcssage onc gets 
when trying to have a serious dis-
cussion wilh somcone who falls to 
the left of ccnter. Whcther cl\plicit-
Iy or, as is more often the case. 
implicitl y stated. the message 
comes through loud and clear. 

In thcir own eycs, liberals arc 
(he kcepers of the world 's grcatcst 
trulhs, and pesky conservatives. 
who dare to di sagrec wilh what 
Thomas Sowcll has described as 
the "vision of the anointcd ," arc 
vicwed as benighted troglodytes 
whom liberal must rescue from' 
the abyss of their own ignorance. 
Such intellectual condcsccnsion, 
coup led with strong airs of moral 
superiority, dcline liberal allempts 
at IXlliti ca l cunversatiun. 

Whilc at lirst this may seem to he 
a harsh assessmcnl, an cxamination 
of so llle 01 the mo~t widely utili led 
pili" 'cology from th.: liberal lex icon 
will illuminatc thc poinl. First of all. 
let us tak.: "educate" as an example. 

When a liberal is spreading his 
political propaganda. hc claims to 
be "cducating" the poor, mi si n-
liJrmed general public. Thc kindly 
liberal bestows upon his ignorant 
pupils "mind-opening" informa-
tion. After all. only an ignoramus 

could possibly disagree with Ihe 
liberal point of view. As liberals are 
kind and gentle souls who feel the 
pain of us poor ignorant folk, they 
seck to "educatc" us with their 
enlightened opinions. 

Ask .CaIPIRG members what 
they arc doing passi ng out leancts 
and gathering signaturcs, and you 
will inevitably be "educated." 
Similarly, the Committee for World 
Democracy (CWD) provides a 
"service" to UCSD by "educating" 
students with various "frcc" (stu-
dent fees pay for them) movies that 
expose students to "diverse': 
(meaning "liberal") points of vicw. 

This is why CWD deserves so 
much money. CWD reccived morc 
than $20,000 last year, which was 
rough ly IS percent of the total bud-
get for all student organizations. Of 
course, one would be remiss to leave 
out Alex Tom's aboned "education-
al" skits against Proposition 209, 
where he and his a'lsociales would 
have "educatcd" students captive in 
their classrooms as to the evi ls of 
209 and the racist Pete Wilson. 

I must be a horrihle studcnt. 
Many allempts havc bcen madc to 
"cducate" mc and "open" my mind 
on various subjects. Thcsc range 
from the mcnts of mandatory vol-
untcerism for collcge students to 
thc nece sity of imposing race-
dctennined quotas to how every-

thing wrong in the world today is 
my fault because I am an evil , 
white male who oppresses every-
one in sight. Somehow I just cannot 
seem to absorb these lessons. 

As a famous conservative once 
observed, I \Yould rathcr not open 
my mind to the el\tentthat my brain 
falls out - a di stinct possibility if 
one is successfully "educated." I' ll 
stick with the classical understand-
ing of cducation, thank you vcry 
much. When one reccives a classi-
cal education , one Icams to think, 
as opposed to regurgitating what-
ever opinions one is spoon-fed by 
the teacher. 

Another pair of words liberals 
love to use in the context of political 
di cuss ions is "simplisti c" and 
"complex." The words are u ually 
couched in a phrase that goes some-
thing likc thi : 'That [the conserva-
tive solution to the probTcm) is too 
's implislic,' because the underlying 
problcm is much more 'complel\ ' 
than your solution accounts for." 
Mcaning, of coursc, thaI you, the 
conservative, are a moron who can-
not comprehend the higher level of 
undcrstanding neccssary to grasp the 
true essence of the problem. 

This is pure nibblc-dec-floo. 
The only way the so lution is too 
simplistic is if it is wrong. Ther ' is 
no law of nature which mandates

DRIVING ALTERNATIVES WILL SOLVE GRIDLOCK 
Editor: 

I rea ll y have to obJect to all the 
gri ping about the parking si tuation 
here at UCSD. I won't deny th at 
parking is tough; hey, spal:e is lim-

niably true. But instead of crying to 
the admrnistratlOn all the time and 
crucifyi ng the parking department

the going price of your soul? 

Souls don't come with a barcode 
- and it's a seller 's market these 
days. What's the price of your integri-
ty? A big bonus check and promo- '

acquaintance? Or maybe a jagged 
line of white powder that promises to 
let you escape your problems? 

Think about that decision careful-
ly - like losing your virginity, once 
you make the initial compromise, 
subsequent compromises become 
easier and easier. And in pite of any-
thing you may do after the fact to 
atone for the sins of the past, you will 
never be the quite the same.

" I didn't cheat on my taxes as 

much as our CEO. What's the big 
deal?" or 'The insurance companies 
are run by a bunch of crooks any-
ways. Who cares if [ take back some 
of the money they steal from us?" 

Lies, all of it. The path of ratio-

Monday. June 2, 1997 

nali7..ation and moral compromise is 
ultimately the road to hell. 

Don't be misled by conventional 
wisdom's mercenary attitude toward 
ethics. Your integrity and honor 
should be priceless, and it is certai n-
Iy wolth more than anything this 
world can offer you. 

Finally, wherever you go, what-
ever you do, remember: 

The best thing in life is free, but 
staying in love with her will cost you 
your life savings and sanity. 

UCSD, I leave you as I found you 
- in peace. Best,

Palmer said she recommends

Marsha ll freshman Amanda 
Sierud said she is annoyed by the 
President 's timing. 

" It disrupts all of our sched-
ules," she said. "We have to be off 
campus. We' re students here and 
we should have priority in getting 
out of here." 

However, Revclle freshman 
Ray lene Jolly said she was more 
optimistic about the President's 
visit. 

"I think it's excellent for the uni-

speak," Jolly said . "I think it 's a has-
sle for the students moving out, but 
these are these precaut ions the 
Secret Service has to take."

Biochemi stry and ce ll biology 
, tudent Tho mas Broudy, who j, 
graduating after threc year, Wi th a 
waight "A" average, wi ll fo llow 
in the footsteps of his UC D men-
tor - Dr. Pau I Price - a professor 
of hi ology, by entering graduate 
" hool at Rockefellcr Uni versll Y 
nex t fall. Broudy slmeu one of hi s 
more mcmorable expcriences as a 
student in UCSD's gospcl choir. 

"Me, a white Jewi sh boy who 
can ' t carry a note, si nging black 
spiriluals abo ut Jesus... The 
strangest part aboul it was that I 
was havi ng a bias!." 

"If you do go into things wi th 
an open mind, you wi ll probably 
end up liking it," Broudy sa id. 
"There isn't anything I didn ' t 
enjoy here - it 's up to the indi -
vidual to make it interesting." 

Phil Garfin, who double-majored 
in literature and animal physiology 
and neuroscience, will attend the 
Uni versity of Chicago's joint 
M.D.IPh.D. program next year. 

"Being an R.A. and havi ng to

Garlin said. "Just do things that

"I think that li rst of all. thi

''Thi s also shows student s that 
facult y are human being, ," he 
added. " It personalilcs the faculty -
student interaction." 

Revc lle Dcan Renee Barncll-
Terry said she fe lt thc banquct was 
a great way to end the year. 

"I think that these arc some of 
the wonderful , great students that 
Revelle has," Barnell-Terry said. 
"This ceremony is just a mall way 
of recogni zing them." 

Richard Alliye h, interim vice 
chance llor for acadcmic affairs, 
gave the evening's keynotc 
address. As words of wisdom to 
gradu ating seni o rs, he quoted 
Meryl Streep. 

"Meryl Streep said thi ' in her 
commencement speech to Vassar 
College: 'You are now about to

Additional outstanding seniors 
were recognized during the 
evening. Michelle Chang, a dou-
ble- major in biochemistry and 
French literature, wi II graduate in 
three years wi th a 3.98 GPA. She 
will enter MIT's biomedical pro-
gram in the fall. 

Judaic studies major Sarah 
Coakley, who has a full scholar-
ship to Princeton' s Theologica l 
Seminary, said there is only one 

way to balam:e academics, 
extracurriculars and some sem-
blance of a soc ial life. 

"Sleep dcprivation is the only 
way to balanee everything," she 
said. "And don 't procrasti nate." 

Revelle seniors named biology 
Professor Emeritus Wi llie Brown 
and li teratl!,re Associate Professor 
William O' Brien as the outstand-
ing teachers of the year. Brown 
and O' Brien will be formally rec-
ognized at Revelle's June IS grad-

IMPACTED: Move

San Diego State University is

In fall 1994 , there were 6,!l!l7

Moore added that students who 
are CSU-cligible but do not meet 
the stri cter SDSU cri teri a will he 
diverted to other CSU campuses. 

. 

"We will do what we can to 
help them go 10 another campus," 
he said. "If appropriate. we will 
recommend they go to a communi-

In recent years. SDSU has 
tri ed to limit enrollment by 
shortening the application-filing 
period . Most CSU campuses 
begin accepti ng applications on 
N ovember I and con tinue for as 
long as paces are avai lable, but 
M oore said SDSU closed its 
1997-98 applicati on peri od on 
D ecember 15. 

However. the university has 
continued to receive more applica: 
ti ons than arc possjble for it to 
accept despite °horter and shorter 
fi ling period~ over the last three 
years. 

T he number of transfer students 
accepting SDSU's offer of admis-
sion has ri sen si milarly. 

SDSU is the second CSU cam-
pu s to implement an enrollment-
m anagement program. Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo started limiting 
enrollment in the early 1980's. 
However. SDSU is the tirst large, 
urban campus to do so. 

SDSU 's Imperial Valley campus 
at CaleKico will not be afTec~ed .

News Tyrant 
Grumbles 

After staring at a blank comput-
er screen for the better part of a 
week, I've c me to the conclusion 
thai I'm not a creative writer. These 
things aren' t supposed to be a" that 
difficult, just a thousand words or 
so, but I' ve had a difficult time 
coming up with something to write 
about. 

I was silting around the other 
day, watching some movie about a 
CIA operati ve being tortured until 
he gave up a ~uitcase fu ll of nuclear 
trigger" when it hit me that I could 
write something abuut the inanity 
of pop culture - but ate beat me 
to the punch a couple of munths 
ago. 

The trouble with writing one of 
these things at the end of the year is 
that just about everything I can 
think of has been done al ready. 
Parking? Been there, done Ihat. 
Relationships,? Same thing. 
Politics? Yup. At one poinl, I even 
thought I'd write about procrastina-
tion - it's not like we haven' t 
beaten that old standby into the 
ground enough times already. 

In the end, I gave up tryi ng to 
fi nd a theme and just started writ-
ing - so if you don't like reading 
the disjointed ramblings of a certi -
fiable lunatic, stop now and lind a' 
copy of TV Guide or something 
equally bland and inoffensi ve. 

I spend most of my time in the 
Guardian office, so I'm not an art 
critic by any means, but I have to 
say that UCSD has some of the 
most incredibly talented dam;ers 
and choreographers that I 've ever 
seen. 

La t Friday and Saturday's 
Spring Student Dance Concert fea-
tured 10 new works. which were all 
choreographed and performed by 
UCSD students. They ranged from 
simple two-person ac ts of grace 
and strength to full-on Vegas-style 
production numbers. 

The dances and dancers were all 
noth ing short of remarkable, and 
I'd be hard-pressed to ingle out 
my favorite. Quite frankly, I'm 
amazed by anyone that can make 
something 0 complex look so sim-
ple - if I tried some of those 
moves, I think I 'd wind up in the 
cmergency room or worse. 

This may get me some hate 
mail , but I' ve always enjoyed 
UCSD's dance festivals, impromp-
tu stairwell concerts (anyone who's 
lived in the dorins knows what I 
mean) and theater perfonnances 
more than the seemingly endless 
string of productions - I hesitate 
to call them performances - put 
on by the A.S. Programming 
Office. 

I'm sure more people go 10 
Programming's events than any of 
the other cultural opportunities on 
campus, and if punk, ska, rap or 
-_~waLev i our cup of lea, then 

great - who am 0 ictate anyone 
el e' ta teinmusic'! - butit 's ju t 
a little ad that so much great talent 
goc unnoticed because we're all 
so wrapped up in our midterm!>,

You're in your early 20s and you 
have your whole life ahead of you. 
What are you going to do with the 

.,est of it? Unfortunately, the laws of 
capitalism mandate that you cannot 
while it away, sUrfing and partying 

at your parents' expense. 
Thus, several options are'available 
for the bright, goal-oriented UCSD 
student - medical school for those 
biology masochists, law school for 
the anal-retentive, business school 
for those who have money on their 
mind and their mind on' the money, 

graduate school for the socially-
dejected book worms or the corpo-
rate ladder for those who feel they 

have had more than their fair share 
of midterms and finals.

Reasons for pursuing a post-

. wa the praciical' aliernati ve to a 
blissful life of drums and beaches. 

"Academics is the only thing I'm 
good at.. .. Hayden said. "] love histo-
ry and it's re~lIy great that I can 
make money doing academics." 

For Hastings School of Law 
graduate Joann Lim, law school 
was an "accident ." After three 
years of climbing the corporate lad· 
der, Lim decided to return to school 
upon the reali.zation that'a higher 
degree of education would "ensure 
success at any job." 

")' m an argumentative person 
and 1've been told I ha ve a rare tal-
ent," Lim said. "Constitutional law 
fasci nates me. plus, being a woman 
of color, I realized it would be for-
ever before I landed an executive 
office - e pecially without a J.D. 
or some son of a higher degree." , 
The FinancIal Aspect 

However, the decision to pursue 
a higher degree is not without its. 
dr~~backs. Even with Ihe aid of 
fellowships and grants, the sub-
tantial cost of a higher degree 

leaves many graduate students with 

staggeringly high debts. 
One University of Pennsylvania 

graduate student says she currently 
owes approximately $40,000 -
only a small portion of which was 
incurred as the result of undergrad-
uate loans. 

Students say they are forced to 
keep their daily living expenses to 
a "bare minimum." Those without 
cars say that because they do not 
have to pay high sums for insur-
ance, gas, parking and miscella-
neous maintenance, they live 
" more comfortably" than thei r 
counterparts with cars. 

Hayden, who says he will most 
likely spend seven years in gradu-
ate school before he obtains Jiis 

• I , 
doctoral degree, is upset at not 
being able Lo have children until he 
is financially secure. 

"In graduate school , there are 
pressures to not have kids," he said. 
"It personally irks me. J'.ffi going to 
be, like 60 when my kid's 20 - but 
that 's a trade-off you have to make 
in grad school. 

"If you raise a family, it is finan-
cially impossible to go to graduate 
school - both parents need to 
work." 

Because some graduate schools 
do not offer all of their graduate 
students teaching-assistant posi-
tions, the income from which helps 
to alleviate the graduate student's 
fi nancial burden. some students are 
worse off than others. 
Self-DIscipline Required 

Despite the drawbacks. graduate 
students say there are many bene-
fit s to being a graduate student, 
including flexibility, being "your 
own boss" and the camaraderie 
developed in the' rigorous academic 
environments. However, freedom

- Joann Um 
Hastings School of Law graduate 

wa purchased at a price. 
Graduate students say that the 

first year is the most rigorous: the 
reading load . is compri ed of at 
lea t three books a week (the aver-
age student reads or studies about 
7.5 hours a day, seven days a 
week.), and the new environment 
requires that students adapt .to new 

tasks and adopt new methods of 
doing things. 

During the first year, admis-
sions officers say that the students ' 
are "weeded ." Those who are 
uncertain whether they want to 
remain in. school to pursue a post-
baccalaureate degree are "put to the 
test" in the first year. 

Hayden says that graduate 
school is the time to find out 
whether you truly want to pursue a 
degree in your desired field . 

"The first year is designed to 
lest you," Hayden said. "!t's a trial 
by ordeal. It 's all about survival. 
Inevitably, there will be a drop-out 
rate. especially when people get 
bogged down by dissertation time." 

The first year of graduate school 
is marked nOl only by a rigorous 
reading load, but also by an almost 
non-existent social life outside of 
the academic community. 

"Graduate school is not the 
place for meeting signi fitant oth-
ers." Hayden said. "Graduate stu-
dent arc either neurotic, married or 
undesirable. We ' re talking about 
people who couldn 't make it in nor-
mal sOciety." . 

Hayden says that be found 
"solace" in his fellow graduate stu· 
dents, living in what he calls the 
graduate students ' "liminal world 
of their own." 
Should you take a yea, off? 

Current graduate students rec-
ommend that students take time off 
to recuperate before entering grad-
uate school. Lim says that taking a 
break from school helped her to 
"develop thi weird, huge desire to 
hit the books again." 

"Call me neurotic, but a big part 
of me actually began to miss those 
long nights in the library," Lim 

Monday, June 2, 1997 

said. "After the rigid nine-to-five 
routine, you actually begin to miss 
college - those caffeinated nights. 
high lighters squeaking, staying up 
until 5 a.m. and then waking up just 
in time for your class at noon." 

Hayden says he regrets nOl tak-
ing time off. A year off could 
refresh students, especially after an 
intense four or five years of under-
graduate studies. 

However, some graduate stu-
dents say that the time off could 
"spoil" you: students often get 
"sucked" into the rear-world, cop-

- ing with the stress of a career, rela-
tionships or starting a family. 

"It was great to be back in school, 
but because it had been such a long 
time since I had gone through that 
whole routine, I was slower than 
most and it took me awhile to 
adjust," Lim said. "Coming from a 
corporate point of view, I have to say 
thaI school is a lot more stressful 
than your nine-to-five, and a lot 
more rewarding - even though you 
don't see the monetary return right 
away. But trust me, juS! stick it out 
and you' ll be making more money 
soon enough." 

However, the job market is not as 
promising for some as it is for others 
- even with a higher degree. , 

"I've seen a lot of friends embit-
tered about the whole thing," 
Hayden says. "But the market is 
always .nuctuating. Having a Ph.D. 
is a better guarantee to getting a job 
than if without [a Ph.D.]."

I 'm excited. It 's historic. 
It 's too bad I'm not going to

to have the President of the

he would have chosen Yale,

came here. 

D_lel Hennen 
Revelle Senior 

It will be interesting to see 
him. I 'm not too interested 
personally in what he has to 
say, because I know he's not 
a very dynamic speaker, nor 
are his ideas his own . Bul at 
the same time, it wi II make 
graduation a major hassle. It 
will mark a fairly memorable 
moment in my life. 

Patrick Schettit 
Muir Senior 

II 's good to have a very 
large political figure like that 
come lip to school and 
express his views. I hope it 
doesn ' t bring too much divi -
sion with the senior class 
when he gives his speech. He 
should act more as a presi-
dent, bei ng a political figure 
who's a patriotic symbol. 

Taryl Kirk

I didn ' t even know that he 
was coming in the fir ·t place, 
but I guess it's cool that he's

not be because you're crap." 
Hayden SUid. "It can also be contin-
gent upon the pool of applicants -
one year at a panicular ~chool . the 
applicants can be a lot ma rc quali -
fied than in another year. 

"Oon ' l 10 e heart." hl! added. 
'There arc plenty of Ihmgs to do in 
life. Graduate school i\ just one of 
them:' 

If the 'i<:hools of your cho".:e 
reject you. remember that the high 
tides arc alway~ welcoming. Who 
knows, maybe your parent~ w n't 
mmd having you around for onc 
more year.

till . I was heartened by the 
strong showing at Friday's perfor-
manec. It wasn't cxactly ovcrnow-
ing. but the Mandevi lle Auditorium 
was reasonably full of students and 
others who chose to sit in a dark-
ened theater for two hours instead 
of getting wasted in Tijuana. 

To change gears a bit, I was hav-
ing a conversation before the show 
about the value of an active imagi -
nation. I like to think I'm fairly 
grounded in reality. but every now 
and thcn I like to escape into the 
world of Wlnnic-the-Pooh (a hear 
of Very Lillie Bnlln ) and all the 
other crcature~ in thc Hundred Acre 
Wood.

this make us bad

trying to drive home the message 
that we do the best job we can -

Continued from page 24 
that he hecame agcnt bail. 

Notoriou\ for preying on ~ uch 
afflict ion~ , agent~ ~ warmed Johnson. 
promising him thc never-ending 
high of superstardom. When he Ii-
nally chose one (who will remain 
nameless for the sake of anonymi ty 
and not because J don ' t know who 
hc is), he got a new shoe contract 
with ike and cven got to be part of 
Nike 's Zoom Air ad campaign: " It' s 
OK to be fast." Johnson was so 
happy that his agent knew he could 
be duped into anything. 

As for Bai ley, his story is a 
l i ttl e more shady. His orig in, for 
one thing, is very controversia l : 
Who has ever heard of a Jamaican 
Canuck? Anyway , from what my 
sources tell me, Bailey is a wild 
card - he !lies by the scat of his 
pants. He came to Atlanta focused 

a complete package to the diamond. 
A local from EI Cajon High, she ha 
tho e in tangib les coaches love. as 
we ll a some very tangible abilities. 

Bel mer was a dust cloud as a 
shortstop, diving and leaping for the 
many balls hit her way, then bru h-
ing herself off, ready for the next 
batter without missing a beat. She 
always appeared weariless despite 
the toll her position takes. 

At the plate, Belmer batted in a 
variety of slot at the heart of the 
order. Her hitting acumen was an 

on one goal: to get as much Ameri-
can lovm ' as possible. 

He was especially impressed with 
our swimmers, and, since they were 
winning gold medals with 'uch a -
tounding frequency. he wantcd des· 
perately to win the IOO-metcrs. 

After the Olympics , Bailey' s 
hC;1rI was broken when hc found out 
that the patriotic swimmers believed 
Johnson was the fastest human. It 
was Bailey 's desire to race Johnson 
Ihat first purred the idea for the 
race. 

When a boxing promoter (who 
shall remain nameless) got wind of 
this event, he smelled money and 
immediately bought his way 10 the 
forefront of the organization com-
mittee. He knew how to turn th is 
thing intoa multi -million-dollar ei r-
cus, and he employed many of his 
boxing tactics to do so. He created 
an unden;ard of cheesy events, sold 
the over-priced rights to a pathetic, 
but national, TV tation and finally , 
crealed the main event.

integral part of the Tritons' prowess 
at the plate. 

Through their excellence on the 
field, both women showed their 
younger counterparts what it takes 
to win . Without these two talents, 
there is no question that the learn 
would not have advanced as far as it 
did. These ladies were the main in-
gredients in the formula forsucces ' , 
and though there are many capable 
youngsters waiting in the wings,the 
10 s of these seniors will bediffirult 
to overcome. 

To write the script for the race, 
he brought in Johnson's agent and 
the non-affiliated. and drooling, 
Bailey. He explained 10 them that to 
make the race 'fai r,' they would 
have to comprombe on the distance 
and make it 150-mcters. Then callle 
w hat our pre~tigious promoter 
thought would be a tough sell, but at 
the sight of the two morons who 
were involved, he knew hecou ld get 
his master plan to work. 

He explai ned to Bailey that he 
was going to win the race and be 
proclaimed the fas lest man in the 
world ifhe j ust cooperated . Bailey 
grunted in agreement. The pro-
moter then told Johnson's agent 
that Johnson's job was to pull up 
lame. Thi way there would be a 
rematch, meaning more hype, and 
another hit to feed Johnso n' s crav-
ing. If al l went according to plan , 
all partie would win . 

Everything worked on race -day, 
and you know who lost? As usual, 
the fans did.

Triton Baseball Suffers Loss of Three Seniors 
THREE: After a surprisingly successful regular season, including an i~pressive 13-4 drubbingof San Diego State, the "Cardiac 
Kids" will lose on-and-off the field leadership of the senior class who helped show the "Kids" the ropes of college baseball 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

This past season, the UCSD baseball 
team was nicknamed the "Cardiac Kids." 
Half of the reason for this name was the 
Tritons ' propensity for close games. It was 
a rare occasion to see a big difference 
in the scoreboard at a UCSD game. 

Nevertheless, the Tritons perse-
vered lhrough these tough games and 
had a successful regular sea on, in-
cluding wins over Cal Lutheran and 
Chapman, the two West Coast repre-
sentatives at the Division III College 
World Series. Perhaps the defining moment 
of their season was not a clo e contest. but 
rather a blowout. UCSD's 13-4 win on the 
road at San Diego State proved to the " Kids" 
that they can accomplish anyth ing. 

The other half of the name came about 
si mply because Head Coac h Robert 
Fletcher's squad was ex tremely young, in-
cl uding seven freshmen and I Qsophomores. 
Five of the tarting eight position players 
were underclassmen, and Fletcher regularly 
used underclassman pitchers as well. 

When a team is tocked with younger 
players, the coaching staff cannot be the 
only source of information and leadership. 
It is expected that the veteran of the team 
must step up and be leaders a well; thei r 
example and their knowledge is crucial to 
the team's success. This was the case with 
the three graduating members of the squad: 
intielder Dave Yerman and pitchers Davc 
Siegel and Mathew Livingston, all of whom 
provided the team with quality leadership 
on and off the lield. 

Yerman has been a quality pl ayer for

Fletcher since 1995, when he played at third 
ba e for one half of the season. A Pete Ro e-
type of crapper, Yerman was the kind of 
player who was never afraid to get his uni -
form dirty. 

" He i a guy who always hus tles," 
Fletcher said. "A good th ing about 
Dave is that he can play anywhere, 
and wherever you put him, you don' t 
have to worry about him not going all 
out." 

Playing anywhere was Yerman's 
specialty, as he was the ultimate util -
ity player. He played thi rd ba e in 

'95, was slated to be a catcher in '97 and did 
some work behind the pl ate. When the start -
ing hortstop, junior Mark Mason, went 
down with a back injury late thi s season. 
Fletcher used Yerman to till the vo id . He 
lilled in admirab ly, playing outstanding 
defense and turning into an offensive force 
at the plate. 

Yerman showed that there truly was no 
po ition he could not play when Fletcher 
used him on the mound in a game against La 
Verne late in the season. With the Tritons 
down 12-5, Yerman came in and pitched 
well enough to hold off the Leopards while 
UCSD mounted a serious comeback. The 
Trilons came back to win, and who was 
credi ted with it? Dave Yerman. 

Dave Siegel came to UC D fmm C 
Santa Barbara, and could bcthe happiest player 
in Triton history. No mailer what the situation. 
Siegel was positive, and he definitely rubbed 
off on his teammates. His positive attitude 
alone made him a team leader, but that wasn' t 
all he brought to the table. 

Along with the positive attilude came 

ONE-ON-ONE PROGRAM FINALE 

one of the most eri ous work elhics on the 
team. He was con tanlly tinkering with his 
game. Irying to make himself better with 
every practice. 

" Nobody works harder than him ," 
Fletcher said. 

The crafty left-hamler was a tough middle 
reliever who, when he was on, was virtuall y 
unhittable. La Verne found out what he 
could do, as he pitched brilliantly against 
the Leopards in the season's final lourna-
ment. 

Mathew Li vingslOn' s story is about what 
could have been . This was his first and last 
year on the squad, as he never intended to be 
a baseball player here. 

In high school. Living ton was a great 
athlete - a line pitcher and a superb quarter-
back for the football team. Thc..6' 5", 205· 
pounder broke his collarbone, though, and 
came to UCSD strictl y to be a student. 
Eventually, hi injury healed, and he began 
to work out his arm with some2!~r playC!s. 
Fletcher was recommended to lake a look at 
him , and he immediately recogni zed 
Livingston's potential. 

In his on ly season here, Livingston 
showed what kind of a pitcher h'e was, 
giving the Tritons many quality starts early 
in Ihe year. He could be overpowering at 
times - his pitches all had tremendous 
movement. 

"Thi s guy could have been very uccess-
ful here." Fletcher said. " . wi sh we could 
have him for a longer period of time." 

As the Tritons look loward next year, the 
lessons they learned from the seniors should 
stick with them. If they do, UCSD will have 
an amazing baseball team for years to come.

Dave Yerman: 
Yerman was an _ 
outstanding all-around 
player for Head Coach 
Robert Fletcher. He was 
the ultimate utility man: 
he played third base in 
'95 and he began the 
season as the backup 
catcher. When the 
starting shortstop went down, he filled in 
admirably. He even came on In relief and 
pitched his way to a victory. 

Dave Siegel: 
A crafty left-hander, he 
came out of the bullpen 
in middle relief for the 
Tritons. He was known 
on the team for his 
positive attitude and he 
was a leader because 
of it. He was also one 
of the the hardest 
workers that Aetcher had ever seen. He had 
an intense work ethic, and was habitually 
practicing on his game. 

'Mathew Uvlngston: 
A former high school 
standout at Quarterback 
and pitcher, this lanky 
righty unfortunately 
broke his collarbone 
before he came to 
UCSD. The injury 
prohibited him from 
playing with the Tritons 
until his senior year, where he was a solid 
starter and long reliever.
