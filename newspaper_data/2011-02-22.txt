Researcher 
May Face 
Deportation
Once Again
By Regina Ip
News Editor

A stem cell researcher who was 
ordered to leave the United States on 
Feb. 5 may once again be obligated 
to return to Indonesia by Feb. 27, as 
UCSD has refused to schedule an 
arbitration hearing in the next two 
weeks. 

“This is another outrageous example 
of UC’s discriminatory behavior 
toward international postdoctoral 
scholars,” United Auto Workers Local 
5810 President Xiaoqing Cao said in 
a statement. “Dr. Helen should not be 
denied due process just because she is 
an international worker.” 

Wilda Helen, a 32-year-old 
postdoctoral researcher from Indonesia, 
wants to appeal her termination by 
presenting it to a neutral, third-party 
arbitrator to determine if the university 
has just cause for termination.

According to UAW Local 5810 
representative Scott Clifthorne, UCSD 
labor relations advocate Belinda M. 
Hein will not work with any of the 
three arbitrators who are available the 
week of Feb. 21 for a hearing.

“She refuses to work with any of 
those three arbitrators despite the 
fact that they’re on the panel of 21 
arbitrators that the university and the 
union have officially agreed upon,” 
Clifthorne said. “She did not explain 
her reasoning.”

With the union’s collective 
bargaining agreement — which has 
allowed both U.S. and international 
postdoctoral researchers the right to 
appeal since summer 2010 — if both 
parties do not agree on an arbitrator, 
they will go through a list to choose one 
in a mutual strike process.

“There’s still time to do the right 
thing here,” Clifthorne said. “There are 
arbitrators willing to hear this now, 
and it’s highly unusual to get three 
arbitrators all with time and willingness 
to hear the case in a single week. For 
the university to take the position that 
they can’t work with any of them, it

UCSD ReCeiveS A ‘C’ GRADe FoR FoLLoWinG CALiF. PUbLiC ReCoRDS ACT
By Laira Martin
Associate News Editor

A California government watchdog group 
gave all but three of the University of California 
campuses failing grades for failing to disclose 
public records in a timely manner — which is 
considered a violation of the California Public 
Records Act. Of the nine undergraduate campuses, 
UCSD was one of three undergraduate campuses 
to receive a passing grade for 2011.

The state watchdog group — “Californians 
Aware”— was founded in 2002 to evaluate the 

lawfulness of public institutions like the UC 
system, which receives 3,000 inquiries each year.

According to the group, 28.1 percent of public 
universities received failing grades while 31.3 
percent received an A+ — none were UC schools.

UCSD, UC Merced and UC Berkeley passed 
with grades of D, D and C, respectively.

Grades were based on a number of factors, 
including schools’ promptness in responding to 
public record inquiries. Documents such as the 
campuses’ Chancellor’s Contract and Statement 
of Economic Interests were chosen to be audited, 
as they’re intended to be public. Of the nine 

campuses, six failed to respond within 10 days, 
which was seen as a violation of the California 
Public Records Act — a bill protecting the right of 
public access to government-related documents.

Californians Aware cited UCSD for four 
counts of misconduct, including failure to respond 
within 10 days, failure to provide employment 
contract and not responding to record responses.

Although the act does not explicitly state that 
universities must respond to inquiries within 10 
days, campuses were marked down for failure to 
do so promptly.

Campus grades were also lowered for UC 

schools that referred public records requests to the 
UC Office of the President.

Grades for California State University 
campuses exceeded the UC schools, averaging a 
B-. Three campuses received an A+.

UC executives expressed dissatisfaction with 
methods and qualifications used in the audit. 

Information Practices Act (IPA) coordinator 
Paula Johnson, who manages public record 
requests made at UCSD, could not be reached.

University of California students waged a campus-wide “Week of Action” Feb. 14 to 18 in response to the $500 million in campus budget cuts proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown for the 2011-12 fiscal year. The 
week’s events included tabling for the California D.R.E.A.M. (Development, 
Relief and Education for Alien Minors) Act of 2011, which would allow eligible 
undocumented students to apply for financial aid, presenting to classes and 
hosting budget town halls and teach-ins.

“We are trying to show the rest of our campus that they can do something 
if all students are united on fighting this,” University of California Student 
Association president Claudia Magaña said. “Our elected officials need to 
understand that this is a misguided and dangerous path that they are taking 
our state.”

At UCSD, students delivered presentations on the current fiscal crisis 
and how it will impact students, in addition to tabling on Library Walk and 
collecting postcards.

Magaña, a UC Santa Cruz junior, said students are putting additional 
pressure on legislators to protect themselves from further cuts.

“We’ll be talking about the D.R.E.A.M. Act, we’ll be talking about the budget 
and we’ll be making sure we have protective language in the final budget,” she 
said.

Magaña said that UCSA aims to collect 10,000 postcards across the state in 
support of the D.R.E.A.M. Act. First introduced in 2006, the controversial bill 
would allow eligible undocumented students to receive financial aid. 

“We’re putting additional pressure with the postcards just to make sure 
[Brown] follows through with the statements he made during his campaign — 
he did say that he would sign it,” she said.

The act has been reintroduced into the legislature, and is not expected to 
reach the governor’s desk until September or October. So far, UCSA members 
have collected about 5,000 signatures.

According to a UC Office of the President statement, if this year’s proposed 
budget passes, it will be the first time in California history that students pay 
more than the state does for their education. If Brown’s tax proposals to balance 
the budget do not pass following a statewide special election this June, Magaña 
sees the outlook as bleak for students.

“I definitely see the cuts doubling,” she said.
In the event that voters don’t approve Brown’s proposed tax hikes, there will 

be a $12-billion shortfall for the state of California, which may yield higher 
student fees.

A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Michael Lam said he is preparing for 
the Student Lobby Conference taking place in Sacramento, where more than 
400 students will be traveling to meet with elected representatives and to lobby 
on behalf of students in higher education.

“This coming week, Feb. 26 to Feb. 28, we have our annual student lobby 
conference where students from all the UCs come together; we have lobby

Researchers Reinvent Audi Vehicle With Live Driver Feedback
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Jonathan Kaslow
Staff Writer

Researchers have partnered with 
Audi in a research initiative to change 
the way people drive cars in an urban 
setting. Their goal for the project, 
which began Jan. 3, is to develop 
smart technology for automobiles 
to ease congestion, dangers and 
inconveniences that affect drivers in 
large cities. 

Electrical engineering professor 
Mohan Trivedi and his team — in 

cooperation with UC Berkeley, 
University of Southern California 
and University of Michigan — are 
working on the “Audi Urban Intelligent 
Assist” project, which incorporates 
driver preferences and automobile 
technology to provide an information 
system to give feedback to the driver.  

The project — launched by Audi 
and its Electronic Research Laboratory 
— will create a system for cars to 
translate real-time information back 
to the driver, incorporating traffic 
patterns, driver movements or 
correcting bad driving habits via 
feedback. Trivedi’s team is working on 
driver diagnostics, like technology to 
track driving habits.

“The vision is to develop next 
generation of vehicles that will 
recognize individual motorists behind 
the wheel, know preferred destination 
and routes the motorists have most 
commonly traveled and the time 
needed to reach appointments,” Trivedi 
said. “The car will be able to help the 
drivers detect and avoid dangerous 
situations better, too.” 

Researchers will gather driver-
sensitive data, such as where the driver 
is looking, where hands are positioned, 
what pedals are activated, as well as the 
vehicle surroundings, such as locations 
and dynamics of other vehicles, lane 
markers and traffic signals.

Trivedi said one of the most crucial 
parts of the research is figuring out 
how to process the information.

“We need to develop signal 
processing, pattern recognition and 
machine learning algorithms to analyze 
these sensory signals to understand 
how a driver performs various driving 
maneuvers,” Trivedi said.

The experimental and 
developmental phases of the project 
incorporates a real-time camera 
systems to monitor activity in and 
outside of a VW Passat. The research 
is conducted at the Laboratory for 
Intelligent and Safe Automobiles 
(L.I.S.A.) at UCSD. 

The results of the research will 
be published in journals, which 
will impact other research projects 
nationwide.

“[Research opportunities] offer 
exciting and challenging problems to 
work on, but the research outcomes 
eventually migrate into vehicles which 
support safe and enjoyable driving 
experience,” Trivedi said.

all just drives home the perception to 
the UAW and lots of the international 
scholars that work at the 
university that they’re just 
trying to force her out of the 
country where she doesn’t 
have a chance to face her 
accusers and the allegations 
they made.”

UAW Local 5810 is a 
union that represents 6,000 
postdoctoral researchers 
in the UC system. On Feb. 
17, Helen and Clifthorne 
went to Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox’s office to ask 
for her help. According to 
Clifthorne, Fox said that 
UC human resources vice 
president Dwaine Duckett 
not she,  had the authority to 
direct Klein. Clifthorne said 
he then informed Fox that 
UC labor relations director 
Gayle Saxton said the case 
will be handled by UCSD.

“This issue of who to select the 
arbitrator [and] who has the authority 
on this issue has been remanded to 
the UC San Diego campus,” Clifthorne 
said.

According to Clifthorne, Fox said 
she was not aware of this and would get 
back to UAW the next day.

On Feb. 17, Helen and another 
UAW representative visited the 
Chancellor’s office again to clarify 

the issue. According to Clifthorne, 
they were then directed to leave the 
office by Vice Chancellor of Resource 

Management and 
Planning Gary C. 
Matthews, who 
contacted campus 
police. 

“We did end up 
talking to Chancellor 
Fox [who] told 
Wilda and the 
campus [UAW] 
recording secretary 
David Selby that 
the Labor Relations 
Office was handling 
this,” Clifthorne said. 
“She wasn’t going to 
interfere.”

Administrators 
involved in the 
case could not be 
reached. University 
Communications 
released a statement 

saying that the university will follow the 
pre-determined arbitration selection 
process.

If the hearing were to go forward, 
Clifthorne said it would take place 
whether Helen is here or not. 

“The hearing will happen whether 
Wilda is in the United States or not,” 
Clifthorne said. “We believe very, very 
strongly that she should be present for 
the hearing because that’s what due 
process is. She has the right to face her 

accusers.”
Helen wants to contest the false 

allegations her termination was based 
on.

“She wants to face the people 
in front of a neutral third-party 
arbitrator and have the opportunity 
to prove these allegations are wrong,” 
Clifthorne said.

When Helen was terminated, 
the university erased her record in 
the Student and Exchange Visitor 
Information System, which made her 
unable to legally remain in the U.S.

Clifthorne said the university can 
re-enter her record on SEVIS.

“That’s obviously still an option,” 
Clifthorne said. “The university 
could decide to reverse the deletion 
of her SEVIS record and allow her to 
stay in the country on unpaid leave… 
That would require the university 
doing the right ting and taking action 
to help Wilda stay here, which once 
again they have refused to do for her.”

 Helen and union representatives 
will continue contacting the 
Chancellor.

“From our perspective, Chancellor 
Fox has the authority to change the 
current process and to direct Belinda 
to pick one of these arbitrators,” 
Clifthorne said. “We’re going to 
continue to work with Chancellor 
Fox to do the right thing.”

trainings to educate everyone on 
what we’ve been working on in the 
UCSA,” Magaña said. “And then 
we go up the 28th, Monday, and 
we lobby every representative in 
the state, because we have every 
campus there.”

Magaña said she is uncertain 

of the outcome of the university 
budget crisis during this fiscally 
difficult time for the state.

“It could potentially get better, 
and it could potentially get worse,” 
she said.

Magaña said students aren’t 
happy with the continued fee 
increases.

“Students are angry about the 
cuts,” Magaña said. “Enough is 
enough. After the 32-percent fee 
increase last year, and the 8-percent 
increase this year, it is getting nearly 
impossible to afford the UC.”

Book the room a week in advance (more, if heel-bruising stumbles back to the 
cheap end of the strip aren’t for you.) 
Flaunt your entitlement issues at the 
hotel reception in the passive voice: 
“Is there really no available upgrade? 
There’s nothing at all to be done?” 

Learn that the receptionist can 
swing a suite for you and your friends 
at no extra cost. Wait a beat — soak 
in the gravity of what this will mean 
for dance parties — and thank the 
receptionist for her efforts. You’re 
so, so very grateful — yes, just a king 
should likely suffice for the night, 
and yes, you’ll tell her personally if it 
doesn’t. 

Ascend the 15 floors to your 
room, passing dead-eyed slot-
machine settlers and bored strippers 
on the way to the elevator. Notice the 
dated ad for Crazy Girls: Las Vegas’ 
No. 1 Topless Revue next to the eleva-
tor door, wherein a line of blondes 
pose from behind in matching under-
wear and heels. Asses sure looked dif-
ferent in the ’80s, didn’t they?

Slide the room key in the door and 
stand in wonder: floral-print every-
thing, enough floor space for your 30 
closest associates to crash come day-
break, a full bar. You were expecting 
a dorm-sized box with a musty bible 
and a view of the next building over. 
How great to be so wrong. 

Marvel at the arrivals of old 
friends, contraband Four Loko and 
foot-long disco sticks — not just the 
stuff of Lady Gaga’s carnal imagina-
tion, after all — with increasing 
wonder, and take all of them with 
you out into the night. Stop at a 7-11 
and ask the cashier if he could please 
unscrew the disco stick battery com-
partment. It’s not what it looks like, 
creep. Buy the wrong batteries and 
the right doughnut. 

Watch the sun rise over the local 
Ross and all the surrounding desola-
tion. Joke about the possibility of 
Crossdressing for Less, and promptly 
fall asleep in the last corner of bed 
available. Spend the day in awe of 
the beautiful fakeness of it all: the 
half-scale Eiffel Tower, the casino 
waitresses, all of the lights. Wait half 
an hour for a foot-long margarita 
at the mall until you learn there’s 
no more Sex on the Beach. You just 
wanted Sex on the Beach. Where’s all 
the Sex on the Beach?

See a stranger convinced he’s about 
to die. Ask whether Miley Cyrus really 
took salvia last year, or whether it was 
all the spin of a quick-thinking publi-
cist who knew it was legal. 

Hear the slam of a hand against 
the hotel door and a decisive shout: 
“SECURITY!” Laugh at your friend’s 
sense of humor on the way to the 
peephole, and realize that there are, 
actually, three unarmed guards. Oh. 

Call out for everyone to hide, and 
open the door. While the officer does 
realize that this is Las Vegas, there 
are other guests, and they are trying 
to sleep. This is your warning — and 
if the officer has to come back again, 
you face banishment from the Riviera 
Las Vegas. Which means you can’t 
come back again. Not ever. Tell the 
officer you’re sorry, you’ll be quiet, 
and feel pride in knowing, on your

have done Vegas right.

Once again, UCSD is the scene of a hate-related incident — but this time, 
few even know what happened. 

The 11th-annual Islam 
Awareness Week kicked off on Feb. 
14. The event, held by the Muslim 
Student Association, aims to edu-
cate the UCSD community by host-
ing barbecues and sponsoring talks 
about the rise of Islamophobia and 
misconstrued Quranic verses. MSA 
members wanted to clear the violent 
and popularly accepted misconcep-
tions about the Muslim community, 
not convert the masses to Islam.  

While it’s not out of the ordinary 
for the MSA to receive threatening 
messages, Islamic Awareness Week 
incited new waves of anti-Muslim 
sentiment, including threaten-
ing e-mails and phone calls to the 
members of the MSA.

Additionally, six evangelical 
Christians  — an increase from 
the usual “Jesus guy” — picketed 

Library Walk and, according to the 
Treasurer of MSA Sharfaa Junaid, 
the protesters also approached stu-
dents looking at the MSA’s event, 
telling them that they were “going 
to go to Hell” for speaking with 
“those people.” 

When a Guardian reporter asked 
one of the self-identified evangeli-
cals — who demanded anonymity 
— whether or not he was affiliated 
and if he had a permit to protest, he 
announced that they were neither 
UCSD affiliates nor did they need a 
permit from the administration to 
demonstrate. (Under the UC-wide 
Non-Affiliate Speech Policy, per-
sons not affiliated with the univer-
sity must receive permission from 
a designated official to demonstrate 
on campus.)

According to MSA Vice 
President External Eyad Alnaslah, 
the vandalism featured uncreative, 
malicious phrases such as “Fuck 
Muslims” and “You are terrorists 

and blood killers.” MSA members, 
including Alnaslah, reported the 
threats. As a result, the Student 
Center for Involvement assigned 
them a security guard during their 
exhibits on Library Walk. 

Junaid said that because the 
center wasn’t sure how UCSD’s 
Free Speech Policy applied to the 
evangelicals, they weren’t able to do 
much more than talk to the pro-
testers and assign security guards, 
despite the MSA’s complaints to 
the Office for the Prevention of 
Harassment and Discrimination, 
the Center for Student Involvement 
and Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue.

Aside from filing a complaint 
with the Center for Involvement, 
MSA representatives met with Rue 
on Feb. 17 to discuss the recent inci-
dents and asked for a campuswide 
e-mail to be sent out condemning 
the act. Penny Rue refused, claiming

South Carolina’s New CurrencyQUICKTAKES

See MSA, page 5

Jane rho/Guardian

In an attempt to avoid hyperinflation caused by the Federal Reserve, South Carolina State Senator Lee Bright proposed a bill on Feb. 3 that would allow 
his state to adopt an alternative currency based on a gold or silver standard. 

Even setting aside the huge constitutional issues, this is a move that 
would negatively affect the state’s economy. Gold, like any other com-
modity, has a highly volatile price: The discovery of a large gold mine 
would inflate the general price of money; conversely, if gold prices 
didn’t keep up with the growth of the general market, deflation would 
occur. The entire market, under Bright’s proposal, would lie in the 
hands of a single commodity instead of in a Federal Reserve that can 
tighten or loosen money as necessary. 

Moreover, regardless of what type of currency South Carolina would 
use, the very existence of an alternative to the dollar would stifle free 
trade. The average American firm would have to trade in American 
dollars to buy something only produced in South Carolina, wasting 
precious time and incentivizing them to purchase from another state. 
Foreigners, too, would rather buy using the more trusted dollar than 
risk using an unstable new currency. As less money flows in to the state, 
there will be fewer jobs and even less tax revenue to support its citizens.

Considering the U.S. is closer to deflation than hyperinflation, an 
alternative currency is unnecessary, at best. At worst, a move like this would 
jeopardize and wreak havoc on the state’s economy.

— Saad Asad
Senior Staff Writer

While at first it seems comical to imagine stopping at the border of South Carolina to trade in $20 bills for equivalent South Carolina 
currency, the fine print’s worth reading: Such a currency would only take 

over if the U.S. currency ever collapses.
South Carolina is hardly the first state 

where this idea has surfaced.  Georgia and 
Virginia have already floated similar ideas, 
including authorizing the state to print 
additional money for in-state transactions. 
None of those ideas came to pass, and 
Senator Bright’s plan won’t likely make it 
past a committee. But alternative curren-
cies — to an admittedly slight extent — do 
have a bit of history on their side. In fact, 
during the Great Depression, West Virginia 
produced made coins backed by the state 
government that could be used at certain 
markets within the state.  

Ultimately, the U.S. Constitution is 
pretty clear about what the Fed can do and 

what the states can do, and Senator Bright’s proposal almost certainly won’t 
make it past the first appeal — but at least, for now, someone in power’s 
looking at a worst-case backup plan.

ThE LiTTLE RinTRAh By Eileen Shi

When it Comes to Campus Hate, Admin Must Take a Stand

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Last week, I was invited to a 

lecture titled “Demystifying the 
Hijab” as part of Islam Awareness 
Week at UCSD.

I was shocked to see so many 
innocent girls lied to about wom-
en’s rights in Islam. 

I did not expect the lecturer 
to lie to people who do not know 
Arabic. She hid the whole truth 
about the lack of honor Muslim 
women receive.

 I am an Arabic woman who 
knows what is written in Quran 
and Hadith. 

After the lecture, I wrote two 
questions. One asked her if she had 
explained everything, or if she left 
out other parts of the Quran that 
insult and dishonor women. The 
other question asked what the root 
of Hijab (the Muslim headscarf) is. 
Because she did not answer either 
of these questions, I approached 
her after the lecture. 

She did not known that Hijab 
was mentioned in Hammorabi’s 
Law. And when I quoted 

Mohammed, she was unsure where 
this quote was from. In fact, it 
was in the Hadith, from which she 
quoted during her lecture! Our 
conversation was abruptly ended 
due to the “line of people” waiting 
to speak with her. 

She did not talk about the use 
of the hijab before Mohammed. It 
was used by Indian women and it 
was written in Hammorabi’s Law 
that a man can announce a woman 
as his wife by putting a piece of 
cloth — hijab — upon her head.    

I feel sorry for those innocent 
young girls of other religions that 
were lied to in this lecture. 

 — Dr. May Kassir
Resident, San Diego

it is no longer protocol.
 So, according MSA VP of Internal 

Affairs, Saad Yazdani, their protesting 
stops with the Vice Chancellor: “we 
hoped the Vice Chancellor would have 
helped us more.” 

But when hate crimes like these 
occur, everyone should defend the 
right to be an individual and practice 
whatever religion he or she chooses. 

The administration is obligated to 
make sure every group feels safe and 
look out for every group that attracts 
hate, not just those that attract the 
least favorable media coverage.
Sending out an e-mail to the student 
body about the attacks would at least 
inform everyone what’s happening 
and legitimize the struggles of the 
MSA.

Racism toward the Muslim com-
munity has increased tenfold in the 
decade following the 9/11 attacks 
and is a far bigger issue than our 
campus. The irony is that the MSA 
events were intended to inform 
students of what the 3-6 million 
Muslims living in the United States 
actually believe, which is pretty 
much the opposite of what the van-
dalism suggests.  

As university students, we are 
here to learn. If the same hate mes-
sages the members of the MSA 
received were targeted at nearly any 
other group, that group would be 
viewed as minority-opinion radicals 
— but because they were targeted 
at a religion that still holds so many 
violent stereotypes to so many 
people, few outside of the group 

are willing to stand up and protest 
against it. 

It’s our collective responsibility to 
recognize and ameliorate hate on cam-
pus, no matter what form it takes. Last 
year, during the ‘Compton Cookout’ 
fiasco, the Black Student Union was 
able to rally enough support to bring 
faculty members, administration and 
media attention to their cause. 

The scale of the attacks on the 
MSA is admittedly much smaller than 
those suffered by the BSU. But without 
the kind of administrative support 
that group garnered in the heat of the 
controversy last year, the MSA’s efforts 
at correcting popular misconceptions 
may all be for naught.

RESTAURANTREVIEW • ANDREW WHITWORTH

E den takes its moniker to heart: the trendy Hillcrest nightclub-eatery imbues everything from 
the restaurant’s lush décor to the 
names on the menu with a sense of 
sinful, decadent indulgence. With a 
menu titled “Food of the Gods” and 
divided into sections called “Shared 
Temptations,” “Eating with Envy” 
and “Enlightened Libations,” one 
might expect Eden to be a more 
upscale alternative to the kind of 
kitschy, family-friendly restaurants 
most of us try to avoid, a sort of 
Zagat-rated Rainforest Café.

The contemporary American 
food joint happily dispels this sus-
picion, applying a sense of playful 
experimentation. A good place to 
start is the Dim Shui ($8), an appe-
tizer that changes by 
day. Though the rela-
tion to Chinese cui-
sine may be tenuous 
at best, the braised, 
Mongolian-style lamb 
shanks are tender and 
well-seasoned in BBQ 
sauce and red wine 
reduction. The “Off 
the Hook” Ceviche 
($12 — also from the 
“Shared Temptations” 
category) was pleas-
ant, though hardly the 
“culinary LSD” the 
menu touted: The heavy-handed 
acidity and chunks of bland seafood 
in the dish were more akin to culi-
nary Ambien.

Eden’s youthful, 
experimental side is 
more easily appreci-
ated in dishes like the 
Snufalufagus, a Sesame 
Street-referencing panini 
composed of black forest 
bacon, cava aged ched-
dar, fried eggs and but-
termilk waffles in place 
of bread. Paired with 
the wonderful truffle 
fries, the Snufalufagus 
($11) makes for a great 
(if overpriced) Sunday 

morning hangover cure. 
The Redeye ($19) is another 

example of Eden’s culinary whimsy, 
a “coffee-cacao rubbed grass fed 
filet mignon,” served with a porter 

beer-based demi-glace and vanilla-
infused mashed potatoes. Though 
chocolate steak and vanilla potatoes 
might sound like a botched Willy 
Wonka experiment, the coffee-cacao 
seasoning is subtler than one might 
imagine, and the muted sweetness of 
the potatoes is a perfect complement 
to the smoky porter sauce. 

The Bangkok Halibut ($19) — a 
banana leaf-wrapped halibut filet 
served with basil-coconut crème and 
a lavender reduction — is surpris-
ingly flavorless without sauce, while 
the lavender reduction is overpower-
ingly floral and unpleasant.

The fried rice served with the 
halibut is a prime example of the 
style-versus-substance dilemma with

In an age when Nike reigns supreme, 
evidence shows the healthiest exercise 
involves going back to basics.  
By Zoë Sophos • Associate Leisure Editor 

A sics Gel Evolution, Nike Shocks, Saucony Progrid Stabil CS2. Like state-of-the-art battle gear, the names of modern run-ning shoes guide beginners and mara-
thoners alike through the combat zone that is a 
running trail. 

All that plastic and poly-blend battle gear may 
not be necessary to surviving a run, though. Recent 
evidence suggests that, in the long run, high-tech 
shoes may hurt even more than they help. The 
trend of barefoot running is supported by studies 
that claim just that, pointing out that people have 
been running without shoes for millions of years 
and that modern society’s insistence on shoes with 
thick rubber soles and layers of padding dramati-
cally alters the natural strike of your foot on the 
ground.

Kenya, Harvard University’s profes-
sor of human evolutionary biology 
Daniel E. Lieberman found that 
habitual barefoot runners usually 
strike the ground at the front of 
their foot, while those who wear 
shoes usually strike at the heel, 
hitting the ground harder in the 
process.

“This difference results primari-
ly from a more plantar flexed foot at 
landing and more ankle compliance 
during impact [in barefoot run-
ners], decreasing the effective mass 
of the body that collides with the 
ground,” Lieberman wrote in the 
Jan. 28, 2010 edition of the science 
journal Nature. Plantar muscles line 
the bottom of the foot; engaging 
them relieves ankle stress.

Chris Wicus, a strength and 
conditioning intern at RIMAC 
Arena, agrees that bulky shoes 
interrupt the foot’s natural strike 
pattern. This can have hazardous 
consequences.

“Because of modern shoe tech-
nology, you’re convincing your 
body that the force you’re putting 
into the ground isn’t as much as 
it is, and that ends up leading to 
overuse or even stress fractures,” 
he said.

Barefoot running has been alter-
nately accused of causing injuries 
and praised for preventing them. 
Of course, conventional wisdom 
insists that shoes are necessary 
protection from cuts, bruises and 
fractures. 

But since the invention of the 
running shoe in the ‘70s, the injury 
rate from running has flat lined, 
and Achilles tendon blowouts have 
increased by 10 percent, accord-
ing to New York Times bestselling 
author and Men’s Health journalist 
Christopher McDougall in his book 
“Born to Run.”

Lieberman, McDougall and 
UCSD strength and conditioning 
interns agree that running shoe-
less makes the muscles in your 
feet stronger, creating a solid base 
for the rest of your body that will 
ultimately result in more natural, 
injury-free running. 

But like any sport, barefoot 
running must be done carefully to 
avoid injury. 

“People need to be in shape, and 
they need to be fit to go run,” said 
Adam Dobler, a strength and con-
ditioning intern. “I think people get 
it backward sometimes and they try 
to go out running to get in shape. 
If you are not in shape and you try 

to go run barefoot, you will hurt 
yourself, because you’re putting a 
ton of force on muscles that aren’t 
ready for it.”

Revelle College sophomore 
William Pandori, a current mem-
ber of the UCSD Triathlon Team 
who has competed in 10 triathlons, 
runs about 15 percent of his weekly 
mileage barefoot. He started run-
ning barefoot as a junior in high 
school, after running regularly in 
sneakers for two years, and said the 
exercise helped him develop stron-
ger muscles and prevent injury.

While making the switch from 
padded running shoes to bare feet 
requires familiarity with the sport, 
recreational runners can still give 
it a try. The right pair of shoes can 
make all the difference: Nike Frees 
and Vibram FiveFingers make 
the transition easier, simulating 
barefoot running by reducing the 
amount of padding around your 
foot. Nike Frees cost about $85 and 
look just like a thinner traditional 
running shoe with a flexible sole; 
Vibram FiveFingers are like rub-
ber gloves for your feet with spaces 
for each toe, and run for about the 
same price.

Warren College sophomore and 
UCSD Strides running club mem-
ber Matthew Huber read about 
Vibram KSO’s in a running maga-
zine and decided to try them out. 

“It took me about a month to 
get used to the shoes, since I had 
to let my body learn the new run-
ning form,” he said. “I could only 
run a mile or two at first, but now 
I can run 10 miles easily in them 
without any pain. My form is a lot 
better than before, I haven’t had 
any serious injuries and I feel more 
efficient.”

According to Rudy Thomas, 
director of strength and condition-
ing at UCSD, preventing foot inju-
ries all comes down to one thing: 
preparation.

“You have to go to a motion 
controlled shoe, down to Nike 
Frees, down to a pair of Vibrams, 
down to your bare feet,” Thomas 
said. “You have to start on grass, 
then work to a track surface, and 
then work to a sidewalk.”

Thomas said he’s working on 
the transition himself: His workout 
consists of a barefoot warm up of 
dynamic stretching like lunges, 
though he’ll put his shoes back on 
for higher-exertion exercise like 
skips or hops. 

Myles Cooper, UCSD assistant 
strength and conditioning coach, 

said the right pair of shoes are also 
pivotal for building strength and 
endurance.

“I would say to go to a store and 
get your gait analyzed by the people 
in those running stores and get the 
special shoes that are made for your 
feet,” Cooper said. 

Going the distance can reap 
generous rewards: a 2003 study by 
the Georgia Institute of Technology 
linked the famous “runner’s high,” 
or feeling of elation and calm after 
running long distances, to the high 
one gets from smoking marijuana. 
They found that both activities 
activate the body’s endocannabi-
noid system, which reduces pain 
and anxiety. 

Unlike the latter, though, dis-
tance running can also improve 
one’s focus. Just don’t go for a 
barefoot Baywatch sprint down the 
beach too soon. 

“It’s the same with anything,” 
Dobler said. “You could go try to 
lift 400 pound in a bench press but 
you’re probably going to get buried 

and hurt yourself. You have to work 
up to that sort of thing. But anyone 
who’s healthy and does a lot of run-
ning, I think it would be great for 
them to get out in the grass and 
run around and feel what it actually 
feels like to run.”

Christine McNamara, dietitian 
and health education specialist 
for UCSD at the Student Health 
Center, recommends all runners 
drink enough fluids and eat well 
during training. Recreational run-
ners should eat about 2.5 grams of 
carbs per pound of body weight 
every day (350 grams, or about 12 
ounces, for a 140-lb runner), and 
that competitive runners should eat 
about 4 grams. 

“Just start slow, be smart and lis-
ten to what your body is saying. If 
you’re feeling pain in your knee or 
something, you have to respond to 
that; your body is communicating 
to you,” Dobler said.

which the menu seems to grapple: 
though the puck-shaped rice forma-
tion is plated well and provides an 
excellent foundation for the artfully 
positioned banana-leaf halibut bun-
dle, the rice itself is underwhelming.

Eden’s tendency toward styl-
ish presentations is more skillfully 
employed on their dessert menu 
(subtitled “Sensual and Sweet,” in 
case you were wondering). Their 
signature Adam’s Apple ($6) con-
sists of a whole baked apple filled 
with McIntosh cinnamon apple 

bread pudding and served alongside 
chunks of black walnut caramel and 
elegant scoops of buttermilk ice 
cream. The apple is cooked to a soft 
warm consistency that’s a perfect 
contrast to the cold, smooth texture 
of the ice cream. 

One of Eden’s biggest drawbacks 
is the price — entrees are a uniform 
$19, and appetizers and dessert are 
similarly pricey. On a student’s scant 
budget, Eden is best when you’re 
ready to splurge on Valentine’s Day 
or an anniversary.

It may be no Garden of Eden, but 
it’s not a bad local substitute.

lEISURE TUESDAy, FEBRUARy 22, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

B elmont Park in Mission Beach offers all the perks of the happiest place on earth — rides, games, shockingly overpriced snacks — at a 
fraction of the scale. An entertainment megalopo-
lis located 20 minutes from campus, the park even 
boasts an athletic club, Wave House San Diego Bar 
and Grill, carnival games and over a dozen other 
attractions — and, located right on the coastline, the 
smell of the Pacific to boot.

Patrons can choose from a wide selection of rides, 
including the Giant Dipper rollercoaster, bumper 
cars, the infamous nausea-inducing Tilt-A-Whirl 
and the brand-new Octotron, which allows riders 
to determine their own speed and direction. Thrill-
seekers who prefer a greater challenge can get their 
007 on in the timed laser maze, where a grid of 
overlapping green light beams requires participants 
to contort their bodies into creative positions to pass 
through.  

For those less interested in high risk, Belmont 
Park offers an indoor pool, pirate-themed miniature 
golf, an arcade and a house of mirrors. Patrons can 
also buy knick-knacks, surfboards, bathing suits 
and tourist garb at coast-side booths reminiscent 
of Venice Beach. Those with small tykes can relax 
at picnic tables or the nearby fire pits after the kids 
enjoy a submarine simulator. 

The overall effect can be a little sterile for twenty-
somethings, but it beats the crowds and the hour-
long commute to Anaheim’s Disneyland. Parents 
will appreciate the kiddy rides, which have just 
enough speed to keep the little ones bouncing with 
energy without any gut-wrenching twists and drops. 
Older patrons should check out the bigger rides like 
Octotron and the Wave House surfing simulators. 
Control Freak, Beach Blaster and Octotron all flip 
and spin riders in cars, though the rush of hopping 
from one to ride to the next might be dulled by the 
similarity. 

The heart of the park is the rickety Giant Dipper. 
Financed in 1925 by famed local real estate entre-
preneur John D. Spreckels, the Giant Dipper is one 
of the oldest coasters of its kind. It’s a bumpy, jerky 
ride, as should be expected of an 80-year-old wooden 
colossus, and one to avoid if you suffer from motion 
sickness, but the sentimental value’s all there: the 
2600-foot long white structure is a fixture of the local 
skyline.

 Admission is always free, but rides and attrac-

tions require some green. Belmont’s basic rule? The 
more tickets a ride requires, the greater the adrena-
line rush. Unlimited ride wristbands are $16 for chil-
dren and $27 for adults. Individual ride prices vary 
from $2-$6. The house of mirrors, laser maze and 
mini-golf cost $7, while Sky Ropes is steeper at $8.

Belmont Park is open Friday through Sunday 
from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. The website, www.belmont-
park.com, has coupons and special offers.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD 
men’s volleyball team took two tough 
MPSF Conference losses this week-
end against Long Beach State and 
Cal State Northridge. Both matches 
saw the Tritons take the first set, 
through both times they failed to 
carry the momentum through to the 
next three. 

Friday’s match with No. 3 Long 
Beach State saw set scores of 21-25, 
25-20, 25-21 and 25-21. With late ties 
in all four games, the Tritons were 
only able to fight through and take 
the win in the first set.

“Neither team hit very well, the 
hitting efficiencies for both teams 
were pretty low, they missed quite a 
few serves,” head coach Kevin Ring 
said. “For each of the games we 
played tonight it was about finishing. 

Even in game one, that we won, we 
had a nice lead, and we gave up a 
couple points late. So that’s the one 
thing; late in the game, 18 all, can 
we go win those? And we didn’t in 
games two, three, and four.”

The score was tied at 15 in game 
two, and tied at 18 in games three 
and four before Long Beach pulled 
away each time.

Freshman middle blocker 
Sebastian Brady showed nine kills, 
one assist, one ace, four blocks and 
managed a game-high .615 hitting 
percentage. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Carl Eberts got game-high 11 kills 
and eight digs, and junior opposite 
Shane Veiga collected 10 kills.

The Tritons have not beaten Long 
Beach State since 2007. 

The Tritons came out strong 
against Cal Sate Northridge and hit 
.550 in the first set to win 25-18, but 
were unable to keep the power for 

the next three games and lost 25-22, 
25-19,and 25-23. Overall hitting effi-
ciencies showed the Tritons at .116 to 
the Matador’s .171, making  it a poor 
night for both teams.

“We just didn’t pressure that 
team,” Ring said. “They passed much 
better than we did tonight, and I 
think that’s a team that’s just OK 
at passing. And we let them off the 
hook and we didn’t have a guy on 
the service line who felt confident to 
say ‘I’m going to go stick my serve 
and get them out of position,’ so we 
weren’t scoring any points.”

Senior setter Phil Bannan col-
lected 10 digs, four kills, two aces, 
and two blocks for a team-high .571 
hits. Eberts took 13 kills, two aces, 
seven digs, and four blocks. Veiga 
had nine kills, six digs and four 
blocks, and Brady showed eight kills 
and four blocks.

After hitting over .500 in the first 

set, the Tritons hit .000, .080 and .031 
over the next three sets. The Tritons 
also had 14 service errors, although 
Cal State Northridge had 15 service 
errors.

“You have to step up to the plate 
and realize there’s going to be a big 
block in front of you,” Ring said. “But 
what’s new? We face that every night. 
We have to go out and have a little 
fight in us and I thought we just went 
down, down, down.”

After upset wins against 
University of Pacific and Stanford 
last week, Ring said he knows what 
his team is capable of.

“We just have to get back to 
playing good volleyball,” Ring said. 
“Controlling what we can control; 
the things that we have to do well to 
win matches are serve tough and pass 
really well. It’s not so much about the 
outcome of the match, we just have 
to be in the match in the moment 

doing the things we are capable of 
doing.” 

Ring also cited the quality of the 
league as a reason for the Tritons’ 
inconsistency.

“We aren’t the only team who 
has done this,” Ring said. “We can’t 
hang our heads, we’ve had a couple 
of rough nights and not played that 
well but this has happened to every 
team out there. That’s how good this 
league is.”

UCSD fell to 6-10 overall and 3-7 
in conference play.

The team will face BYU twice in 
Provo, Utah this weekend on Feb. 24 
and Feb. 25. The Tritons will be back 
at RIMAC Arena Friday, March 4 
and Saturday, March 5 for rematches 
against Pacific and Stanford. Both 
games will be at 7 p.m.

Triton Volleyball Falters After First Set in Both Matches This Week

By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — In its first weekend with the 
No. 1 ranking, the UCSD baseball team had 
a minor stumble, but still took three of four 
games from visiting Cal State East Bay. The 
Tritons won 1-0 and 10-4 on Saturday, and 
lost 8-4 in the first game on Sunday before 
rebounding with a 7-2 win in the second 
game.  

“I think we are doing a great job at han-
dling adversity,” head coach Dan O’Brien 
said. “We really aren’t playing well right now. 
In the first game today [Sunday] we played 
probably the worst game in a number of 
years. We’re a little inconsistent, we’re going 
to work on that. But in the meantime our 
effort was consistent and that helped us pull 
off a series win.”

In the first game, senior ace Tim Shibuya 
(3-0) was as magnificent as always, throw-
ing seven innings of one-hit ball to pick up 

his third victory of the season. Elias Tuma 
threw two hitless innings to earn the save. 
A Danny Susdorf double in the third inning 
that scored Aaron Bauman was all the offense 
the Triton pitchers would need for the 1-0 
victory.

The second game featured considerably 
more offense, as the Tritons got 10 runs on 
11 hits, and were led by four RBI from right 
fielder Kyle Saul. First baseman Nick Hom 
added 3 RBI — including a solo home run 
in the third. Senior Guido Knudson (2-0) 
pitched eight strong innings to get the win.

Defensive issues contributed to the Triton 
loss in the third game. Up 3-1 early, the 
Tritons gave up four runs in the fourth. 
The Pioneers tagged starter Daniel Simmons 
(2-1) for four hits in the inning, and an error 
and a poorly played double steal allowed East 
Bay to take the lead. 

Simmons left the game and took the loss 
as the Tritons were unable to catch up to the 
Pioneers.

UCSD bounced back in the final game of 
the series as the Tritons knocked around East 
Bay starter Zach Aguirre for 10 hits and six 
runs. Aguirre lasted just three 2/3 innings, 
and the Triton outfield combined for seven 
hits and four RBI. Junior Greg Selarz (2-1) 
allowed seven hits and two runs over five 2/3 
innings to get the victory in the seven-inning 
game.

UCSD is now 10-2 overall and 3-1 in 
CCAA play after the series.

“Up and down the line up, we’re all con-
fident,” Bauman said. “Anyone can get a hit 
anytime. We’re as confident as we were last 
year.

The Triton will take their first road trip 
next weekend, as they travel to face Cal State 
Monterey Bay for a four-game series. The 
first game will be Friday at 2 p.m. in Seaside, 
Calif.

Franklin Session had 20 points, and Chris 
Robinson added 20 of his own off the bench 
to lead the Golden Eagles.

The Tritons fall to 11-15 overall and 6-14 
in the CCAA. UCSD needs to win its two 
remaining games — road games against Cal 
Poly Pomona and Cal State San Bernardino — 
and get some help in order to take the eighth 
spot in conference for the final berth into the 
CCAA tournament. 

The Tritons will play at Pomona on Friday 
and at San Bernardino on Saturday, with both 
games at 7:30 p.m.

EIGHT STRAIGHT FOR TRITONS

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD women’s 
basketball team extended its winning streak to eight 
games this weekend, after picking up two routine 
wins on the road against bottom-of-the-conference 
squads Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal State LA.  

With the wins, the Tritons improve to 18-9 over-
all and 16-4 in the CCAA— clinching the third place 
in the conference standings, and more importantly, 
securing a home game in the first round of confer-
ence playoffs to be played on March 1.

On Friday, the Tritons captured a win against 
Dominguez Hills, 71-57. It was a much closer con-
test than the last time the two teams met , when the 
Tritons handed the Toros a 74-45 thrashing.

The Tritons posted another solid performance — 
shooting 54 percent from the field in the first period 
to take an 11-point lead into the second half.  

The Toros pulled to within five points at the start 
of the second half with back-to-back jumpers from 
guard Jessica Cannon, who finished with nine points 
on the night. But a field goal from junior guard 
Chelsea Carlisle and consecutive three-pointers from 
freshmen forward Elaina White and guard Nicole 
Anderson-Jew shut the door on the Dominguez rally.  

Carlisle finished with a game-high 25 points and 
seven rebounds.  Junior center Lauren Freidenberg 
finished with 15 points off 5-of-8 shooting, while 
sophomore guard Emily Osga tallied 13 points and 
six rebounds.

On Saturday, the Tritons dealt Cal State LA its 
16th conference loss this season in a 71-63 victory.  

Carlisle — an All-American and UCSD’s leading 
scorer in the team’s past nine games — once again 
stepped up for the Tritons, going 4-of-9 on three-
pointers and sinking 21 points on the night.  

White and junior guard Daisy Feder also con-
tributed nine points apiece, while freshman guard 
Megan Perry went three-for-three from behind the 
arc to finish with 10 points on the night.

Golden Eagle guard Angeline Jefferson and 
junior forward Lacy Ramon — who tallied 19 points 
and 23 points, respectively — combined early on in 
the game to give CSULA an early lead.  But after a 
quick substitution brought White onto the court, the 
freshman sunk a jumper to tie the game at six.  A 
three-pointer on the Tritons’ next possession gave 
UCSD the lead, which they would not cede for the 
rest of the game.

Although the Tritons have secured a playoff berth 
and a first-round home game, next week will be big 
for UCSD.  The Tritons will finish off their regular 
season with two consecutive road games against 
strong conference opponents in Cal Poly Pomona 
and San Bernardino, who are in second and fourth 
in the conference, respectively.   

“We didn’t play too well this past weekend and 
we’re definitely going to have to improve for next 
weekend.” Osga said.

On Thursday, Feb. 24, the Tritons will take on 
Pomona — a squad with a 17-2 conference record 
who narrowly bested the Tritons 75-82 last month.  
The Tritons will travel to CSU San Bernardino to 
take on the Coyotes on Friday.

“We are really excited about this next week,” 
head coach Charity Elliott said.  “We’ve got a real 
challenge before us with both San Bernardino and 
Pomona but I sure like the focus and effort of our 
team right now.”

TRITON SWIMMERS TAKE HOME 
THIRD-STRAIGHT PCSC CHAMPIONSHIP

By Tyler Nelson
Associate Sports Editor

SWIMMING — After four days of heavy 
competition, the UCSD swim team 
took home its third consecutive title at 
the Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive 
Conference Championships this weekend. 

Despite falling behind on the first day, 
the women’s team took over on the sec-
ond day and never looked back; the men 
started the tournament with the lead and 
never lost it. At the end of the meet, the 
Triton men scored 1548.5 points, more 
than 150 above their closest competitor, 
Cal Baptist University; the women fin-
ished with 1635 points, almost 400 points 
more than their closest competitor, also 
Cal Baptist. After the championships,, the 
Tritons now have 29 swimmers qualified 
for the NCAA D-II national champion-
ships, which will be held in San Antonio, 
Texas from March 9-12.

The first day was all about the relays, 
as both teams won two. The men’s 200 
individual medley relay team of Eric 
Owens, Nick Korth, Adam Yen and Blake 
Langland touched the wall in 1:30.40, 
nearly four seconds faster than its clos-
est competitor and an NCAA qualifying 
time. The men’s 800 freestyle relay — 
made up of Alex Merrill, Kyle Begovich, 
Julius Espiritu, and Michal Lorch — also 

put up a qualifying time of 6:42.18 in 
their race.

On the women’s side, the 200-med-
ley relay team of Sandy Hon, Michelle 
McCadden, Jessica Ferguson and sopho-
more Amber Tan also snuck in under the 
qualifying time — edging it by four-tenths 
of a second — and scored first place with 
a time of 1:44.31. Junior captain Alex 
Henley, senior captain Anju Shimura, 
Emily Adamczyk and freshman Anji 
Shakya posted a 7:31.06 in the 800 free-
style relay, to take first place and record a 
qualifying time.

On the last day of competition, UCSD 
had the victory wrapped up at the start of 
the day, but still put on a great show and 
won multiple competitions. Adamczyk 
set a conference record in the 200 breast 
stroke with a time of 2:14.40, while the 
Tritons scored a 1-2-3 finish as Neda 
Nguyen and McCadden also medaled in 
the race. Gabby Rossbach and Henley 
won the 200 butterfly (2:04.34) and the 
200 backstroke (1:58.72), respectively, and 
Rossbach also won the 1650 free with 
a time of 17:28.45 to mark the indi-
vidual winners for the women on the 
last day. The women’s combination of 
Henley, Shimura, Olivia Fountain, and 
sophomore Katherine Tse also won the 
400 freestyle relay with a time of 3:27.67.

On the last day, Matt Herman took 

home the 1650 gold with a time of 
15:44.80, while Korth won the 200 breast 
stroke with a time of 1:58.56 to round out 
the individual champions for the men on 
the day. Korth’s time set a PCSC record 
and broke his own school record. In 
the final relay to finish the meet, Reid 
McCallum, Sam Stromberg, Merrill and 
Langland took second place with a 3:02.11 
time.

“It was awesome to be in a huge lead 
compared to the other teams, but I think 
we knew we were going to win at that 
point,” Shimura said. “It was about try-
ing to win the most events, and we’re 
definitely trying to get a lot of people 
to nationals cut, and put the best team 
together as possible.”

Langland and Henley were award-
ed the 2011 PCSC Men’s and Women’s 
Swimmer of the Meet honors, respec-
tively, for their outstanding performances. 

“This year, we kind of already knew we 
were going to win when we went into the 
meet, but everyone still gave 100 percent,” 
Shimura said. “We did awesome, everyone 
did really well.”

Overall, the Tritons have 29 swimmers 
qualified for nationals, a mark higher 
than each of the last two years.

Tritons Beat No. 13 
Dominguez Hills, 
Fall to CSULA
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

MEN’S BASKETBALL — In two days this weekend, 
the UCSD men’s basketball team got a big 61-59 win 
over No. 13 Dominguez Hills on Friday before falter-
ing down the stretch to lose 64-62 to Cal State LA on 
Saturday. 

On Friday night against Dominguez, the Tritons 
were forced to erase a 10 point second-half deficit to 
get the win. UCSD trailed by seven with 5:22 remain-
ing, but went on a 6-0 run to get within one point. 
With 1:05 left on the clock, James McCann was fouled 
on a three-point attempt, and the freshman point 
guard hit all three of his free throws to give the Tritons 
a 60-58 lead — their first of the second half. After 
trading free throws, Dominguez missed a three at the 
buzzer to give the Tritons the victory.

The Toros have lost three of their last six after start-
ing the season 16-1, but remain in second place in the 
conference standings.  

“We’re a group that played some tough games early,” 
head coach Chris Carlson said. “When you play a 
tough schedule you don’t really fear a lot. We respect 
everyone but we fear no one. Dominguez is a program 
that we have a lot of respect for and they’re obviously 
very good. But its not like we go in there feeling like 
we can’t have some success if we do the things we’re 
capable of doing.”  

Forward Justin Brue had 17 points and five 
rebounds to lead the Tritons, while reserve guard 
Tyler McGrath added 13 points.

Against Cal State LA, the Tritons held a 53-43 lead 
with 9:15 left to play, but the Golden Eagles finished 
the game on a 12-3 run to snatch the victory. Cal State 
LA didn’t allow the Tritons to make a field goal in the 
final 4:40 of the game. The Tritons lost despite shoot-
ing nearly 49 percent for the game.

“We weren’t able to execute very well against their 
press, and in a couple of key moments in terms of 
getting a defensive rebound we weren’t able to secure 
the ball,” Carlson said.  “We just had some things that 
really didn’t go our way.”

Brue had 17 points for the second consecutive

Chelsea Carlisle had 21 and 25 points in the two games this weekend as the Tritons picked up two wins.
