Physicist Herbert York Speaks About Nuclear-Test Ban 
LECTURE: First 
UCSD chanceJlor talks 
with students 
By Tabitha Granshaw 
Senior Staff Wnter 

UCSO's first chance llor, 
Herbert York, discussed a nuclear-
test ban Monday night at the 
Pepper Canyon lodge. 

There have been about 2,000 
nUclear-weapons tests since the 
United States conducted the first 

~uch te ~t in I Y45 . York said that 
01 these 2,000 tests, ahout YO per-
ccnt were conducted hy thc U.S. 
or Russia , and the rest werc done 
by China, Britain , France and 
India. 

Also, according to York, bracl 
ha!> nuclear weapons and Pakistan 
prohahly does. However, neither 
Israel nor Pakistan have conducted 
nuclear tests. 

York said the original motiva-
tion for nuclear testing was to 
check the effectiveness of the 

dl!\ign,. 
"The purro~c III having nuLiear 

tests , at the heginning, wa, prilllar-
ily to develop nuclear weapon,," 
York !>aid. 

According to York , rdille -
ml!nts have steadily Imp roved 
nucll!ar weapons ~() that now teM~ 
arc normally run to check for the 
weapons' reliabilit y (lmj safety. 

York ~aid many governments 
believe there will evenlUally be a 
ban on nuclear testing, but that it is 
difficult to create a treaty all coun-

tfle~ lind a<.:ceptable. 
"Though the top leadcr~hlp ha~ 

been in favor of it, in a world that 
W;l\ t:haractcri/ed hy thl! di~tru~t~ 
;JIld antagonisms of thl! cold war ... 
tlley t:()uldn't generate a treaty th.ll 
would he sall~factory to enough 
people to he WIdely ac<.:epted," 
York said. 

At:cording to York, internally, 
the \l!adership 10 each country 
also questioned whcther a 
nut:icar-test ban \yould really be

Chancellor's Run Unifies 
Students, Administration 

Thc~e duy~ it i~ rare for a college or university 
uJmini~trator to be inh.:rC\ted and pcr~onally in vo lved 
with the \tudcnh on hi\ or her ca mpu\ UCSD is 
lucky to have \uch an admini"trutor. Chancellor 
Rohert Dynes. 

Dyne\ once again ... howed hi ... dedicullon lO ~IU ­
dent, with the ~e(;l)nd annual Chancellor's Challenge 
la,l Friday to kickoff our Homecoming wl!ekend. The 
run wa, cn.:atl!d la~t YCcu to hnng togl.:thcr faculty, 
stall, administ ralor, and studenl~ , and to nllse money 
for UCSD's Undergraduate Scholarship Fund . 

ot only did the money rai~ed from entry fees con-
trihute to the scholarship fund. hut Dynes himself 
contri huted II ve dollar~ for every partici pant and 
another five for everyone that finished ahead of him . 

A~ the 74th runncr to cro~s the finish line, Dynes gave 
$3.650 out of his own pocket to help fund students' 
educations. 

Tht! Chancellor's Challenge brought much-needed 
unity to UCSD, bringing together all those affiliated 
with the university for un excel lent cause. Such an 
occa~ion i~ not often ,ccn on campu~ . 

We at UCSD shou ld thank our involved und active 
chancellor, as well as the 588 runner~ for helping to 
make this years Chancellor's Challenge a success.

COMMENTARY: Even after cease-fire, Bosnia is marked by death and 
destruction - and the rest of the world stands by, unmoved 

ACTION NEEDED IN BOSNIA 
By Tommy Vu 
Contflbutlng OpinIon Wrtter 

"In Ihe name of all the women 
in Eurorc who hecame mOl hers in 
concenlralion t:amr', I would like 
10 ask , 'where arc our l'hi Idren 
nov. "!'" 

Thi, pain-filled question 
poured oul of Ihis woman. a Nazi 
uea(h-camp survivor, like Ihe tears 
from her eyes. In her gripping (es-
limony. she gave a firsl-hand 
account or what life \Va., like in 
Auschwill.. perhaps (he mml infa-
mous or all Nazi dealh camps. She 
described in detail how inran t ~ 
were IOs~cd alive into crematory 
ovens anu how newhorn~ v.ere 
murdered immcdialcly ai"ler hinh. 

Thi~ woman 's testimony \Va, 
one of many horrifYIng accounl, 
told during (he Nuremherg Trials 
In 1945. The Uniled Slates 
promised the world Ihat never 
again would it allow such alroci -
tics to oct:ur. 

In 1992, 47 years arler Ihe cnd 
of the second World War, Ihe 
United Sillies, along with Ihe rest 
of the world. neglected (0 keep (hlll 
promise. (he results of (hut negleel 
were Ihe rape and slaughler of 
250.000 men, women and chi ldren 
during (he civil war in Bo~nia­
Herzegovina. 

In Ihls hloody t:ivil war, entire 
lowns were systema(it:ally wiped 
OUI. Innocen( children [1laying in 
Ihe fields were mert:i lessly shot. 
Human beings were shipped off (0 
cont:entra(ion camps like lives(ock 
being led to the slaughler house. 

All of Ihis pain and dealh was in 
the name or elhni l.: deansing. 
Sounds familiar (0 Hitler t:alling 
for Ihe death of Jews. gypsies. and 
homosex ual s. doesn't il? 

It is (ime Ihalthe pcople of (his 
planet close yet llnother sad chap-
ter in our hislory and bring 10 jus-
tice those responsible for t:rimes 
against humanity. 

Bosnia was once pari of the 
nalion of Yugoslavia. The two. 
sometimes (hree fat:tions 
(Muslims, Serbians and occasion-
ally Croatians), that occupy (his 
geographical region have feuded 
since the Ottoman Turks swepl 

The world sat by 
passively and 
watched the 
televised atrocities 
in Bosnl. 
Herzegovina. Now, 
the world must act. 
" Is time the war 
criminals are caught 
and brought before 
a court comprised 
of members of 
different countries 
and Judged for their 
horrendous crimes. 
Ihrough Europe hundreds of year:, 
ago. 

With (he end of World War I, 
whit:h hegan with (he as,as~inalion 
of Arch-Duke Franz Ferdinand in 
Sarajevo. Bosnia. Marxisl 
Communism spread throughout 
Europe. 

Under Ihe Iron flsl of 
Communi,m. the faclions were 
held in relalivc pcat:e. When Ihe 
Soviet Union collapsed. however. 
all hell hroke loose in Yugoslavia. 

The Christian Serbs. under the 
leadership of war t:rimina l 
Radavon Karad~ic. called on reli -
gion and ethnkity as a rallYing cry 
10 exterminate Ihe Muslims and 
seize their lands. 

Thus. the references to ethnic 
"cleansing": (he purification of a 
land of unwanled ethnieilies. The 
Croatians. also Christian, allied 
Ihemselves againstlhe ill-equipped 
and linder-manned Muslim army.

Though some or these war 
criminals have been captured by 
NATO, Ihe number IS relatively 
small. A war Iribunal was estah-
lished al The Hague anu, although 
some t:riminals were proset:llled, 
Ihe (rihunul is defunct. The trihunal

With the recent ~Utce~s or

'Tap Dogs' Have Their Day 
Australian musical makes a splash across the Pacific 

By Ilona Fass 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

For a, long ,,\ th!.'y can remelll -
ber, Dem and Sheldon Perry have 
heen maklllg I11U,It' wi th the ,ole, 
of their , h oe~. 

Award-winning choreographer 
Dcin Perry drew upon hi~ expert-
.::nce a~ an industrtal mechanic in 
Newca,tic to create "Tap Dog~," an 
explosiv!.' theatrica l , how fcaturtng 

~ix guys who reinv.:nt tap on an 
industnal construuion ,,:1. 

Perry'., innova ti ve idea~ have 
made him the youngc~t. and the 
lirsl. to win th.: Olivier Award for 
choreography two conseeuti ve 
times in a row. 

Signature acts include angle 
grinders that make ~parks so the 
music Can be arpreciated visually; 
a man who tap, up~ide down while 
hanging from a harnes.,; lar danc-
ing on trigger rads that sensor 
drum ~()und ~; and a scaffolding 
scene in which the dancers huild in 
time to th \! music. 

For the past we~k , S h ~ ld on 
Perry, Dein Perry 's younger broth-
er, has hecn performing in Hawaii . 
Before performing last Friday 
night, Sheldon Pcrry spoke with the 
Guardia/l about "Tap Dogs." 

His slOry hegim when he left 
school to work for hi , father a~ a 
trllek dri ver in Sydney. When Ihe 
dance show "42nd SI reet" callle tll 
town, Perry grahhed the chance to 
audilion for it. He 'tayed wi th that 
production for rwo )'e:II' until he 
and his hrolher hecame fru~lrated . 

" We were only domg a time step 
when we had trained ' Int'e WI.: \Vcre 
live years old ," Sheldon '~lId _ 

They grahhed the ha" glll tar 
rlayer, got hlill to play ekclric 
hass, picked ur a key hoard and an 
electri c guitar along the way and 
culti vated "'90s-style tap." 

With a small government granl 
lhal gave Ihe Perrys Ihe ahi li ty 10 
aud ition tap dancers from all 
around Australia, the " Hol Shoe 
Shufne" was born. This cleared the 
rath thai ultimately led to the pro-
duction of "Tap Dogs." 

Courtesy of til" C,VIC ThenLre/ Joan Marcus 
Men at work: Sheldon and Dein Perry star in the rocking mUSical 
"Tap Dogs," in which cons tructton workers build to the beat. 

Sheldon I ~ fond 01 p.:rforl1llng

"The American audience, arc 
ahsolutely fantaslic. I'm having a

Commerce and several other Latino profes-

Grecnlield McGrath. McGrath is a )1ioneer 
in Latin-American civil right, and the

"Zuot SUII ." 

McGrath remained cOJll)1o,ed a~ the

"The two 1ll0"t ~upporli Vl' comI11Unitl e, ," 
McGrath said . "were the hlack community 
and the Jewish cOIllJl1unity." 

At that time. she said. the black press and 
the Jewish )1ress were in coalition and

The incidcnt . which came to be known as 
the Zoot Suit Riots, wa~ the first civil rights

HORROR: 
Scary movies spice 
up Halloween 
Continued from page 9 
slasher mOVies, but also fit into the 
category of humans who slash. 

Other categories Within thi s sub-
genn: include monslers who slash 
("Gremlin,," "Dawn of the Dead"), 
human, turned monster who slash 
("InterView with the Vampire," 
"The Fly," "An American Werewolf 
in London"), monsters lurned 
human who sla, h ("Re-Animalor," 
'The Thing"), families who slash 
human, ("'Texa~ Chainsaw 

Ma~sat:re"), humans who sla,h 
familie, ("I Spit on Your Gravc") 
and everyone', favorite, vegetablcs 
and animals who slash ("Attack of 
the Killer Tomatoes," "Cujo"). 

Human, turned monster i, the 
mo,t inlriguing of the Slasher cate-
goric,. These movie, examine the 
internal bailie of good versus evil 
Ihal writer, have explon.:d for cen-
turies. 

As Ihe protagoni,ts in each lilm 
tran,lorm in to monster!>. , Ihey 
struggle to suppress Ihe beast with-
in that desi res to kill and feed on 
human life. Only death can stop thc 
inner monster from completely tuk-
i ng over. The horror comes from 
seei ng thi, struggle. 

HEAVY:

did the last one, hut it 's fundamen-
tally the same. We' re not trying to 
recreate whal we already did hy 
any mean, - we want to move to 
the next leve l. 

Same thing when we do the next 
record, it 's nol going 10 be like this 
one or the last one. It might be a 
combination of bolh, it might be a 
combination of something e lse, but 

DOGS:

Continued from page 11 
endurance it require~ . Perry :lmih-

ule~ hi s ~tamina to the energy hL! 
receive~ i'rom the audience. 

"At Ihe end of the sho ..... you 
drop hecause you don't realize 
how far you 've pushed yourself," 
he said. ''The audient:e helps you 

Maybe, though, the horror also 
t:omc, from scenes like lefT 
Goldblum's t:haracter in "The Fly" 
turn into a freakish manlfly mon-
strosity and puke acid on people so 
that he can slurp up the bloody 
mess. Regardless, the human 
turned monster slasher movie is not 
only guaranteed to frighten you, II 
will also make you think twice Ihe 
next time an evil desire tries to 
make you do something naughty. 
Supernatural Rims 

These movie, contain aspet:ts of 
the slasher lilm, yet the central 
action of the plot is based around the 
ability of the main characters to sur-
vive through a supernatural event. 

Categories of supernatural hor-
ror movie, int:lude humans pos-
sessed hy the devi I ("The 
Exorcbt," "The Omen"), houses 
po'>sessed by the supernatural 
("Poltergeist," 'They Live Under 
the Stair,," "Evil Dead 2"). humans 

po~~esseo hy h(JU~e~ (,The 
Amityvi lie Horror," "The 
Shining") ano humans with ~upcr­
natural powers ("Firestarter," "Thl: 
Dead Zonc," ·'Scanncr,"). 

Stephen King I ~ crucial in his 
role in the supernal ural lilm. The 
horror experience i~ incomplete 
without ~eeing one of King 's 
movics mentioned above. In parlic-
UIUl , "The Shining" showcase, hi , 
abi lity to create a ~crious horror 

wc ' re not setting any boundaries 
for us. We don 't want to get ,tuck 
plaYing one thing, one ,ound, one 
sty le. 
So you're trying to avoid a 
rut? 

ot even so lIluch avoiding a 
rut, hut keeping il fre~h . We' n.: nOI 
ever going to try 10 disorient or 
freak the fans out and give tht:m 
something they can' t relate to. At 
the same time we want our fans to 
grow with us. 
Do you aim to be at the cut-
ting edge of heavy metal? 

I don't know why people alway~ 

pll~h yourself to thi s unbeli evable 
levcl." 

One of the uniquc aspet:ts oi' Ihc 
~how is Ihal thL! performcr, ca ll 
each olher hy the ir real name~ on

The UCSD Guardian 

movie without a single death . 
Like the human turned monster 

category, we watch as lack 
Nicholson 's characler changes 
from a loving husband 10 a mur-
derous freak in a hotcl that ha, 
mysterious supernatural powers 
over his psyche . The culmination 
of hi s insanity comes when his 
wife finds the novel he 's hecn slav-
ing away at : three hundred pages 
of the sentence, "All work and no 
play makes lack a very dull hoy." 
Creepy stuff. 

For those looking for something 
more fun, "Evi l Dead 2" is a must. 
One of those movies that b so bad 
it's good. Ihis film has bad at:ting, 
no plot. little dialogue and great 
action. The ci nematography and 
t:omic gore keeps the movic enter-
taining. In one ~cene, the camera 
angles in on ,omconc's head being 
cru,hed, and Ihen follows the pcr-
,pcctive of the eyehall as it pops 
out of the guy\ head, tllC~ acros, 
the room, and lands in a screamll1g 
woman 's mouth. Thi, i, what 
Halloween is all about. 

So a, you hrow,c the horror ,cc-
tlOn at your video ,ton: thi, 
Halloween, fight the urge 10 rent 
the samc "Friday the 13th" Iype of 
movie, that you ,ee every year. 
There i, a world of horror ou t therc 
waiting to scare the bCJee/u~ out of 
you. 

worry ~o much about the "cutting-
edge" or what 's modern or not, 
hecau,e really the on ly thing that 
matters is what is good. There i~ 
good music and there i\ had Illu,ic. 

SOllie of my favorilt: records arc 
from 10, 12 years ago. Those rewrd~ 
are limcle~s, not hecausc of the styk 
of rnu~ic or whatever, hut because 
Ihe music is so good it doesn 't need 
to be dated. That's what I want 10 
make when I make music. 

I wanl to make musit: that 10, 12 
years from now you put it on and 
you say, "Damn, that's still pretty 
fucking good." 

originally did these roles . If the tap 
dance works, the rest of the body

Ihe unique thing."

Sunday Oclober 26th 6: 15 PM. Who's On Fire, the top ranked AA 

team was up againsl The Milkmen, a formidable leam Pointlorward 
Shaun Mecginn has Ihe ball allhe right elbow. He gives his defender 
a lillie shake and bake and he's gone. Being 6'3', and with skills, Ihe 
deuce IS hiS. So he rises up, has a little George Gervln "llI1ger roll" 

acllon going. Plays ovel right, nahl 
Shaun turns the ball over In mid flight and th rows it down!! Yup, thaI's right he dunked 

II. Nol a lillie dunk, he snapped the rim and everythingll The Milkmen were sluck in Ihe 
lane, kind 01 like that Michael Jordan commercial, where he spins on Ihe Lakers, yup Ihal 
one" The gym was rockin and Ihe Who's On Fife Groupies were hyped. 

Who's On Fire wenl on 10 sweep 11 ,5, 11 ,5, but everybody Wi ll remember the lam

Wave of Emotion Drowns UCSD 
EDUCATION: Young UCSD men's soccer learn continues to learn after 2-0 loss again t Claremont 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

Rcmcmoer "The Wonder 
Years"? Rcmcmoer all the 
trials and tribulations 
Kcvin Arnold went 
through on his way to 
hecoming ... wcll, whatever 
he becamc (Editor's Note 
- I didn't watch the last 
few episol/e.I' OK? I know 
his dad died, but outside of 
that, just work with ~). 

The same thing applies to the 
youthful UCSD men's soccer team. 

The ~l)uad has heen thrown 1010 the 
fire tit" year hy Head Coach Dl!rck 
Armstrong and ha~ hl!ell learn ing 

It:~son~ all season long. 
It learned another one 

yesterday in their 2·0 los~ 
to Claremont McKenna 
College: emotion alonc 
can win games. 

The Stags had to win 
this gamc much worse 
than the Tritons. Thcir 
playoff hopes were shaky 

at best and a win against UCSD 
would definitely help them. The 

Tritons had In he up for the match 
or he drowned in a wave of emo-
lion. 

From the opening whi!>tic the 
Tritons hcgan gasping for air, and 
after Stag forward Luan Lai scored 
in the 12th minute, UCSD never 
came up again . 

"They outplaycd us," Triton 
assistant coach Ted Prlybylck said. 
"Thcy nceded Jthc winl more than 
wc did. We wcren't there today. We 
didn't have enough emotion and 
they did." 

The Tritons went into halftime 

trai ling by Olle, and necded to come 
oul ll trong earl y ill the second half. 

That , however, would not be the 
case. The Stags scored in the 53rd 
minute, putling the game away. 

UCSD will learn from this loss 
- the sting will not easily go away. 

Hopefully, UCSD will continue 
its habit of learning quickly in its 
next game, Saturday against U.S. 
International University. 

Whenever Kevin learned from 
his mistakes there was a happy end-
ing, and maybe the Tritons will get 
one too.
