Overcrowding Is Yet Unresolved 
HOUSING: Muir and 
Warren students are 
the most impacted 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Staff Writer 

Four weeks after students 
moved into on-campus accom-
modations, overcrowding 
remai ns a problem for many 
students, with Muir and Warren 
students most heavily affected. 

Housing and Dining 
Services Director Larry Barrett 
said that about 70 students con-
tinue to live in temporary 
spaces. Temporary spaces 
include rooms with three resi-
dents in a double room, or fi ve 
students in an apartment creat-
ed for four people. 

Warren College Resi dent 
Dean laire Palmer sa id 29 

apartments that normally house 
four students continue to house 
li ve students. Palmer also said 
that three students are sharing 
rooms with Resident Advisors 
whereas normally Res ident 
Advisors do not share their 
rooms. 

As spaces open up at Warren 
college, students li ving with 
Resident Advisors have the first 
priority to receive permanent 
spaces. Palmer said 13 students 
li ved with Resident Advisors at 
the begi nning of the year. Ten 
have since received permanent 
spaces. 

Palmer also said that du ring 
the summer, Housing and 
Dining Services set up a pro-
gram that would provide stu-
dents wi th a 16 percent dis-
count on their apartment hous-
ing costs if they ag reed to li ve 

in temporary spaces set up to 
house students. Out of the 29 
apartments holding II ve stu -
dents, four apartments arc lilled 
with residents who entered into 
this agreement. 

Palmer said students were 
cautioned about the t:ontracts 
that were offered. 

"We tried to counsel them 
out of it," Palmer said. "We 
wanted them to know what they 
were getting into." 

Palmer said that Warren col-
lege has the highest level of 
overcrowding. 

"We have a much higher 
enrollment ," she said. "Warren 
seems to be one of the most 
popular co lleges. We were up 
27 percent in applications this 
year alone."

A.S. Officer 
Resigns 
From Post 
OFFICE: Former A i tant 
Programmer Snehal Naik will 

. take over a commi lOner I 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a letter stating that !>he feared other 
time t:olllmi tments would impact her perfor-
mance in the A .. Counci l, omnllSSloner 
of Programming Karen Juan announced her 
resignation on Monday. Last night , the A.S. 
appointed former Assistant Programmer 
Snehal aik as the new commissioner of 
programming. 

A.S. President Joe Leventhal said that 
while most vacancies are filled through a 
more lenglhy process, he felt Ihal ;1 was nec-
essary to ti ll the post immedialely. 

"Programming is one of those oflices 
that can ' t stop," Leventhal said. "Also. the 
most qualified candidates for that position 
are found already working within the 
offi ce." 

Leventhal said that the process of linding 
a replacement for Juan was simple. 

"The only other people that I had in 
mind were not interested in the position," 
he said. 

Juan is the third A.S. Commi sioner to 
resign this term. Her resignation was pre-
ceded by last year 's resignation of 
Commissioner of Services and Enterprises 
Michelle Magalong and thi s year 's resigna-
tion of Oliver Butterick as Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs. 

Leventhal said that oflicers often resign 
because they face high demands both as stu-
dents and A.S. members. 

" It 's important to always remember what 
each of us is here for, that is, to be a stu-
dent," Leventhal said. "Basically when you 
try to balance everything demanded of you 
in A.S. with the average responsibility of 
being a student, it sometimes becomes more 
than a person can handle. It 's acceptable and 
rather routine t have a number of clected

'UCSD Health Sciences Releases Plan for Improvement 
STRATEGY: Report 
ays 'triple threat leads 

to compromise in quality 
By Eric Brace 
Senior Staff Writer 

In th'e last 30 years, UCSD 
Health ciences has become one of 
the best medical research in tilU-
tion in the nation, ranked 10th by 
the National Research ouncil with 
neuroscience and biomedi ca l engi-
neering ranked first and second in 
their respecti ve categories. 

The health sciences' cl inical repu-
tation, however, has been falling. 
Departments such as oncology and 
geri atrics, which at one time received 
national recognition, "no longer have 
national prominence," stated a recent 
strategic plan released by the U SD 
Health Sciences. 

Julianne Howell , direc tor of 
Hea lth Science Planning, said the 
UCSD Health Sciences Strategic 
Plan 1998-20 lOis the first attempt 
of the re earch, teaching and cl ini-
cal 'egments of the health cicnces 
to establish a trategic plan for 

eva luating the responsi bi lities of 
departments and faculty members 
toward resea rch, educa tion and 
cl inica l work . 

The report states that an obso-
lete faculty model called Ihe "triple 
threat" has contributed to the disap-
pointing cl inical results. 

The "triple threat" characterized 
the ideal faculty member, who con-
tributes to all three miss i ns of a 
health sc ience profess ional -
researcher, teacher and clinician. 

Thi s model, however. is nO 
longer feasible when considering 

the burdensome re ponsibilities 
within each miss ion, Howell said . 

"For the past two generations, 
the ' tri pie threat ' was an ideal 
throughout the nation," she said. 
"But either demanding research or 
wide, hands-on, primary care can 
make this model impos ible. The 
strateg ic plan proposes a new 'dou-
ble threat ' model." 

The plan divides faculty members 
into four "double threat" categories,

community will include a spel.: trum

UCSD Must Excel in All 
Departments to Compete 

To say the UCS D science departments are "in the 
money" wou ld be an under~ tatement. In the last year, 
the engineering and bioengineering departments have 
received a s lough of large donation~. 

La~t Wed ne~day, Ihe Whitaker Foundation 
announced it had donated 13.8 mi Ilion to the 
Department of Engineering. At the same time, the 
Charles Lee Powell Foundation announced it had 
made an 8.3 million con tribution to the Irwin and 
Joan Jacobs choo l of Engi neering. In cast: you for-
got, our engi neering schuo l became the Jacobs 

chool of Engineering after Irwi n Ja ob~, the founder 
of Quaicollllll , In . and his wife lavished the ~choo l 
wi th aeao l $15 million. 

Thi s is a ll good news for C O. However, in the 
midst of all thi s donation fever, it seems as i I' our 
social seicncc and humanities departments have been 
le ft in the dust. 

If UCS D ever intends 10 rea ll y compete wi th UC 
Berkeley and U LA for th t.: title of crown jl.:wel of 
the UC system, then we must excel in all depart-
ments. Right now, we are moving dangerously close 
to becoming a glorified version of lIT Tech. 

To combat thi s one-sidedness, the uni versity must 
provide a universally excellent educati on for all 
majors. A university is on ly as good as the sum of its 
pam. Until UCSO injects some money and vitality 
into its underdevelopt:d segmt:nts, we wi \I be eternal-
ly unba lanced. 

Moving to Division II 
Ultimately Benefits UCSD 

Oespit UCSO's superior athletic program - the 
best overall in NCAA Division III - students often 
say that they do not allend games because UCSO 
plays primari ly small and often unheard of schools. 
Last wet:k 's 324 to 193 faculty approval of the ath-
letic department's move from Division III to Division 
II competition by the fall of 2000, will greatly bene-
fit campus . The move will not on ly bring UCSD 
more recognition , but it will also instill more school 
spirit. Finally, UC D will compete against schools of 
our size and stalure, such as U Dav is and UC Irv ine. 

A bigger sports program wi ll bring more t:xci te-
ment and a bCller sense of community to U SD. Of 
course a bigger sport~ program ca lls for more funding . 
The Gllardia/l encourages lind expects the university 
to back the move to Division II both verbally and 
financiall y. U SD current I spend~ approximately 
$500,000 ca '11 year on alhletics: the average Divi~ion 
II s hool spends $2.3 million. Though the increast: is 
signilicant, the Guardian feels it is a wise investment 
- it will only increase the quality of life on campus. 

Eventuall y, U SD will not nly be considered an 
outstanding academic institution, but a fun sch 01 to 
attend. Imagine!

STUDENT'S DEATH INSPIRES 
HATE CRIME. AWARENESS 

COMMENTARY: 
Everyone shou ld make 
an effort to end the igno-
rance In our ociety 
By 8rlan Wikner 
Staff Writer 

By now, everyone has heard uholll 
the tragic and unju 't circumstances 
related to the death of Universi lY of 
Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. 
While everyone can agree that it was 
indeed a horritil: and savage death, few 
have stressed thc imponance of the 
fa r-real:hing implications of such an 
ael. 

Last Friday, there was a rally at the

The nex t time the opportunity aris-

We have all heard people Illaking 
defamatory state rn ent s that are, in real-
ity, hate speech. We simpl y di smi ss 
these individuals as "ignorant" or 
unworthy of our time. This is where a 
difTerence can be made_ 

The next time you see an inoi vid-
ual calling an yone a "fag" or refer-
ring to something as "gay," connotat-
ing a deprec iative quality, make it 
known that this usage is unacl:ept-.

modern-day usage of such terms is no 
better than what white supremacists 
were sayi ng and doing to African 
Americans in thi s \:Ount ry less th an 
forty years ago. T here is no justifica-
tion for thinking of any human heing 
as lesser because of something a, 
inherent as gender, ethnicity, sexual 
orie ntut ion or handicap. 

Congress is currentl y considering 
the Hate Crime Prevention. Act. legi s-
lation that wou ld lI1ake hate crimes 
hased on gender, sexual orien tation or 
handicap prosecutable under federal 
law. The hri stian Coa lition 
(Reli gious Right) has gone to ex treme 
lengths to prevent the passage of such 
legis lati on, which would protect 
hOlllosexuab and promote equal ity of 
rrOiection against hate crimes. These 
tactics range from running full -page

HARSHER LAWS WILL NOT SOLVE HATE CRIMES 
Editor : 

I applaud the Guardian's ciT rts 
to edu (:a te the punli \: about vio-
len\:e against minoriti e, by memo-
riali zing Matthew Shepard . 
However, I must take issue with 
your recent editorial ("Congress 
Should Protect Individuals Like 
Shepard," GIIGlllian . OCI. 15, 199M ) 
calling for federa l hate-I:rime legis-
lation. Although the Guardian gave 
no reason for it s suppon of hate-
crime laws, I imagine that there are 
two primary motivations. 

It might be reasoned that a law 
that made hate crimes a federal 
offense. summoned the FBI to 
investigations and stiffened penal-
ties would serve to deter sUl:h 
crimes in the future . Placing defen-
dants in doublc-jeopardy by adding 
federal to state criminal charges 
docs not add to our security. In any 
\:ase, the FBI I:annot pursue such a 
\:ase-Ioad, and 10l:al law enforl:e-
ment does a line job. 

Furthermore, violent crimes arc 
nowhere dealt wi th too lightl y. 
penalty can be grea ter than the 
penalty of capital punishment the 
accused face in thi s case. 

The outrage thi s event has elicit-
ed across the nation has led to a 
widespread show of sympath y. It is 
likely that the ca ll for hate-crimc 
laws is motivated by the desire to 
demonstrate our co ll ec tive I:on-
demnation of such crimcs. 

I share thi s desire, nut I do not 
beli eve that a statement of our soli-
darity should be worded in the lan-
guage of criminal law. nor do I 

believe that the fruit of our com-
munal disapproval should be an 
inl:n:ase in punishment. 

It is ironic that the cause of 
minority - and specifi ca lly gay -
rights and well-being, a traditional 
concern of the Left. should mani-
fest itself in a form that looks 
familiar to us becau,e of the 
Right 's policy of increasing pri son 
populations and instituting such 
draconian forms of punishment as 
minimum-sentenl:ing and three-
strikes laws.

Hate Crime Laws Are 
Not Our Business 
Editor: 

[n the Oct. 15 edition of the 
Guardian. I read the account of 
Matthew Shepard. killed in a pre-
sumed hate crime in Wyoming. I 
am appalled at the way peop le are 
real: ting to this incident. It is terri-
ble that people are wanting legisla-
t ion passed because of Shepard's 
murder. 

One isolated act of murder is 
not I:o nclu sive ev idence of a 
nationwide epidemic of hate crimes 
and hould not be treated as such. 
Furthermore, what purpose would 
hate-crimc laws serve? It is already 
illegal for someone to comm it li rst-

state has no hate-crime legislation

thing that such laws could accom-

PROP 5 TREATS ALL CALIFORNIA TRIBES FAIRLY 
COMMENTARY: 
Voting in Prop 5 wi II 
reverse the negative 
effects of Pala compact 
By Tommy Vu 
Staff Writer 

One of this summer's mOSI 
important debates was the passion-
ate deliberation over Slate 
Assembly Bill 1442. the Pala com-
pact. 

The Pala compacl deals with 
Indian gaming. The bill was signed 
by Gov. Wilson and the Native 
American tribe called Pala, hence 
the name. It allows ce rtain Native 
American tribes to establish casi -
nos on their lands in accordance [() 
the rules and regulations prescrihcd 
in the document. 

However, if the Pala compact 
allows and regulates Indian gam-
ing, then what are all these rampant 
commercials about Proposition 5'1 
Proposition 5, also called the 
Indian Self-Reliance Initiative. 
would repeal the Pala compact and 
provide new outlines for Indian 
gaming. Il differs from thc Pala 
compact and is more equitahle 
toward all Native American tribes 
in California. 

It is wi th in the full rights of 
Native American tribes to have 
casinos on their lands if they so 
desire. Each tribe is its own sover-
eign nation and has the right, as any 
sovereign nation, to do as it wishes 
on its land - including running 
casinos. Each tribe drafts its own 
laws. has its own type of police 

department and acb essenti all y as a 
separate nation. 

Being sove reign nations. sepa-
rate from the United Statcs, the 
tribes do not pay federa l or state 
taxe,. T he tribes do , however, 
receive federal ai d. 

ali fornia and the federal gov-
ernment do receive taxes from the 
Indian cas inos, though not directly. 
Although the revenues from the 
casi nos themse lves an: not taxed. 
non-tribal workers of the casi nos, 
heing American citi zens. are taxed 
by both governments. The win-
nings of the casinos' patrons are 
also laxed. Plus, both gamblers' 
winnings and casi no profil s are 
pumped back into the American 
economy. 

Being sovereign nations, each 
tribe has the right to sign trealies 
and compacts with the federal gov-
ernment or the state. simi lar to 
what the Pala tribe and the state of 
California singed in the Pala com-
pact. What the Pala compact and 
Proposi lion 5 do is give a linal 
answer to a subject that has been 
long debated in Califomia: Indian 
gaming . 

Despite the existing Pala com-
pact. Proposilion 5 is necessary 
becausc it is more equitable to all 
gaming Iribes. 

There are several provisions in 
Ihe Indian Self-Re liance Initiative 
thai are very important. Siricter 
health and safety regu lations and 
deferment of revenues to non-gam-
ing tribes arc among Ihese provi-
sions. 

Currently, federal laws do not 

One advertisement 
claims that these 
casinos could be 
built next to your 
child's elementary 
school or Just next 
door. Crime in your 
area would 
Increase says 
another 
commercial. They 
could sprout up like 
weeds In your 
neighborhood, 
scorns another. 
These, of course, 
are all lies. 

allow states to regulate Indian gam-
ing. Proposition 5 would allow 
Califomia to have a hand in the 
regulation of Indian casinos, pro-
vid ing benefits comparable to those 

Ca li fornia req uires for its own busi -
nesses. 

Another important factor in 
Proposi tion 5 i ~ the provision of 
net revenues to non-gam i ng 
tribes. According to the initiative, 
up to 6 percenl of the net win -
nings will be "di stributed on an 
equitable ba~i s for education, eco-
nomil: deve lopment, cultural 
preservation, hcalthcare and other 
tribal purposes to federally recog-
ni zed tribes in Californi a that 
have not participated in any form 
of gam ing." 

Non-ga min g tribes , many of 
which arc poor and are not oplimal -
Iy located to have casinos on their 
lands, would be prov ided with 
funds to assist in the education of 
their children and the preservation 
of their culture, among other 
things. 

This type of independence for 
Native American tribes, however, is 
not somelhing that everyone wants. 

Opponents to Proposition 5 
claim that the initiative would 
harm our children and undermine 
the valu es we hold dcar. 
Television cOlllmerc ials, paid for 
by our ever-enduring Nevada casi-
nos, claim such things . One 
advertisement claims that these 
casinos could be built next to your 
child 's elementary school or just 
next door. Crime in your area 
would increase says anolher com-
mercial. They could sprout up like 
weeds in your neighborhood, 
scorns another. These, of course, 
arc all lies . 

These casinos could only be 

built and IUn on Native American 
land, hence the nallle "Indi an ca, i-
nos." Furthermore, lhe trihal lands 
are located far from any ci ti es 
becau e the ative America ns 
were forced at gu n-poinl onto 
unwanled land 100 some-odd 
years ago. 

As for crime, any broken laws 
are, and always have been. under 
the purview of Slate and local 
police. Nevada casi nos are onl y 
interested in whal happens in 
California becausl:! they do nut 
need. or want, co mpelit ion to draw 
people away from their greedy, 
money-grubbing Las Vegan lisls. 
The Indian Self-Reliance Initiative 
would provide the kind of compe-
tition the casinos from Nevada 
fear. 

The Pala compaci differs from 
Proposition 5 in important areas. 
Not only does the current Pala 
compact nOI help fund non-gaming 
tribes, il is also unfair to olher sov-
ereign tribes that do desi re to have 
casi nos on their land. 

A pari of the Pala compact 
reads: "Any other compat:l 
entcred into bet ween the Slate of 
Ca lifornia and any uther federall y 
recognized Indian Tribe which is 
executed after Aug . 24, 199K, is 
hereby ralified if the compact is 
identical in all material respecls 
to any of the compacts .. .. " This 
mea ns that any tribes wishing to 
open up a casino on their land 
after Aug. 24, 1998 can only do 
so if they agree to the terms set 
forth in AB 1442, the Pala com-

TYSON AWARDED LICENSE TO BITE AGAIN 
COMMENTARY: 
Why the he ll are they 
letting this lunatic 
back into boxing? 
By Travis Hill 
Senior Staff Writer 

Here 's a fun image: an angry. 
fru , trated Mike Tyson rcaching up 
to tear into Evander Holylield's ear 
with a viciuus bite, ripping the 
Ilesh and spilling the bloody carti-
lage out onlO the canvas. That W,IS 
or course, the second time Tyson 
allel1)ptcd «) bi te Holylicld . 

ot prelly, is it? 
Tyson 's untamed rage and unbe-

lievable stupid ity had countless 
repercussions, bOlh for him and for 
the entire sport of boxi ng. In quick 
review, Tyson had hi s boxi ng 
license suspended for a year and 
was tined $3 million (a paltry sum 
for "Iro n" Mike considering hi s 
take that night). The sport of box-
ing is now a laughable shell of its 
furmer sci f.

foundations of the boxing world on 
Tuesday when his license was rein-
staled by the evada State Athlelic 
Commission by a 4-1 vote. 

Now, everyone in Iheir right 
mind is thinking. "Why Ihe hell are 
they lelling this maniac buck into 
hox ing? What 's he going to do next, 
bring un assau lt rille into the ri ng'!" 

Well , I hope not , but everyone 
concerned about Tysun doing 
someth ing insane is delinitely justi -
lied. He is by no means ment ally 
stable. So again , why the hell is 

evada leuing this lunatic back 
into the ring') 

Simply. Las Vegas is all about 
money. Of course, there are quite a 
few infuriated people who insist 
that Tyson has no business being 
back in the ring. 

" Disgusting," said Anne 
Golonka, an offi cer or the National 
Organization for Women. 'Tm bit-
lerl y di sappointed. There was 
absolulely no negative testimony 
given at all . No one said he should-
n' t be allowed «) box. It was lotally 
one-sided." 

Sane or insane, 
Tyson will return to 
boxing in the one 
city that could bend 
every rule in the 
name of the 
almighty dollar-
Las Vegas. 

No kidding. Sorry Ms. Golonka, 
but you arc not using your head. 
The Nevada State Athlelic 
Commission does not deal with Ihe 

The third annual () 1'$ 

rights and wrongs of morality. 
Sadly, it deals with the mores ,1Od 
lesses of economics. 

Tyson is one of the biggest 
money -makers in sports history. 
Ever time he steps into the ring, 
he sell s out the ar.:na . Then, the 
host city hccolllcs thl: huh of the 
sporls world I'm about a week , 
lranslallng into millions of tourist 
dollars. not to mention the (;()unt -
less olher millions paid to watch 
thc lighl on pay-pl.!r-view. 

ane or insane, Tyson wi ll 
return to hoxing in the one ci ty that 
cou ld bend every rule in the name 
of the alm ighty dollar - Las 
Vegas. The people who run Las 
Vegas know whal kind or a linan-
cial windfall Ihis means, and they 
are not aboul to brush olT whal will 
most likely translate into hundreds 
of millions of dollars in revenue. 

New Jersey on the olher hand, 
didn't get the chance. Although 
Tyson began hi s reinslatement tour 
in the Gurden Stale, it was a disas-
ter. He hroke down and sobbed dur-
ing part~ of the hearing, and then he

That was the linal straw. Tyson's

W<1S no way the New Jersey State 
Ath letic Commission was going to 
reinslate him, so Tyson took hi s 
application orr Ihe docket and fl ew 
wesl to much greener paslures. 

The re inslatement process in 
Nevada was also a three- ring cir-
cus, but al least Ty on didn 'l kick a

PROP 5: 
Pala compact is a 
threat to other tribes 
Continued frOM ..., •• 
pact. 

This hindrance explains the 
staunch division over the vote 
for the Pala compact. Applying 
to all gaming tribes. this com-
pact was originally signed only 
by Gov. Wilson and the leaders 
of the Pala tribe. The hill does 
not compel the governor tll 
negotiate with all the tribes that 
seek a gaming compact. It is. 
however. a threat to other tribes 
that did not sign the Pala com-
pact. as it treads on their sover-
eignty as separate and proud 
nations. 

Assemblymember Jim Ballin 
and his colleagues in the assem-
hly recognized this threat and 
lobbied the state Senate against 
the compact. However. because 
of the Democratic majority in the 
state legislature. the Pala wm-
pact was ratified on Aug. 24. 
1998 . 

These differences reveal 
themselves where the Pala com-
pact fails and the Indian Sclf-

ReliaOl:e Initiative suc(ccds. 
Proposition 5, in accordance to 
its name. allows each trihal 
nation to be se lf-reliant and inde-
pendent on its own terms. not on 
the terms of the governor and a 
single tribe. 

It possible to vote in support 
of Indian gaming, while at the 
same time find gambling a waste 
of time and. more importantly. a 
waste of hard-earned money. 

So. come Nov. 3. we can vote 
to allow Native American trihes 
in California to succeed and to be 
independent by passing 
Proposition 5. It would repeal the 
Pala I;ompact and allow Indian 
gaming to continue, though 
under stricler regulalions. We 
need to realize that fairness and 
equability can still be applied 
where it should have been 150 
years ago .

TYSON: 
Magic and Ali vouch 
for "Iron" Mike 
Continued froM ...,. 7 

Former Los Angeles Laker bas· 
ketball superstar/upstanding citizen 
Magic Johnson, who apparently is 
one of Tyson's linan,iul advisors, 
told the commissioners of how 
Tyson has selllcd down and how he 
intends to take his return slowly (a 
lillie side note: why would Tyson 
hire Johnson as a linancial advisor? 
Didn't he ever see ''The Magic 
Hour"?). 

Even the greatest one of them 
all. Mohammad Ali, came to the 
former champ's defense. In a pre-
pared statement. his wife Lonnie 
read, "I know he is ready to walk 
from the meeting today and make 
his mark on history." 

That's great and all , but exactly 
what mark is that? With all Tyson's 
shown us thus far, that mark could 
very well be another horrible scar 
reminiscent of the one Holyfield 
will bear for the rest of his life. 
Does someone, possibly even 
Tyson himself, have to be seriously 
injured before people realize that 
this man i damn-ncar unfit for reg-

ular society, let alone to be a 
famous boxer'! 

These are questions that really 
don't have much relevance in the 
grand scheme of things. The bot-
tom line is that people wi 1\ st ill pay 
to see this guy. sadly, maybe more 
now than ever before. 

It was fun though, to see one of 
the five Nevada commissioners, Dr. 
Elias Ghanem. give Tyson his 
"warning." 

"Mike. you have made a lot of 
mistakes," said Ghanem in Ihe hear-
ing. "I know sometimes you think 
you 're a victim, but let me lell you 
this: Most of your problems are of 
your own making. I want 10 warn 
you: You will conduct yourself in 
Nevada according to our rules. or 
you will never fight again." 

Ooh, very stern words Dr. 
Ghanem. I'm sure Tyson really 
took that to heart. This warning of 
course came after Ghanem placed 
his vote in favor of Tyson. 

So, is there a way to light this 
decision'! The best way to really 
stop Tyson from lighting is to stop 
watching his light ·. 

Remember: 0 money, no 
Mike.

There's a war going on in 
California, a war for ju tice and 
survival. It's not being fought 
with bugle blaring and rifles 
blasting; it' s being fought with 
ophisticated political campaign 

weapons. 

Don't be fooled, the political 
campaign over Proposition 5, the 
Indian Self-Reliance Act, is a 
war - the outcome of which will 
determine whether America ever 
intends to honor its agreements 
with Native Americans and 
whether California Indians will 
have the same economic oppor-
tunities enjoyed by all Ameri-
cans. 

Instead of land, the governor 
and the U.S. Justice Department 
are threatening to take away 
Indian property - their casino 
games. Why? The motives are 
the same - greed and power, at 
the expense of America's poorest 
people. Indian tribe have the 
highest poverty and infant mor-

United States. Indians on reser-
vations have an 80 perc~nt un-
employment rate and have twice 
the risk of early death, substance 
abuse addiction, and three times 
the risk of suicide. 

A few tribes have begun to 
alter these dire statistics through 
revenues earned by tribal govern-
ment casino gaming. 

Yet, the right of tribes to gen-
erate what is a small amount of 
money, compared to tate lottery 
and Las Vegas gaming revenues, 
is being challenged.

examples, like the people who 
return full wallets as the eXl.:eption 
rather than the norm for lal.:k of 
adequate statistil.:s . After all. thi s is 
why you hear about them,) 

The argument about work is 
redul.:ed to the ract that employers 
are wi lIing to give you time for 
your fami Iy, especially on week-
ends. and that i I' you don' t like 
your work load you can sti II find 
another job, A society that truly 
respects human dignity should not 
place you in front of this dilemma. 
From the letter. Zurek appears to 
be a Christian . although I am not 
sure of whidl confession , In case 
you are Catholic, you can see the 
exact same point expressed by the 
Pope. 

The argument about eroticism 
states, first of all, that chastity is the 
solution to all the problems. Of 
course it is! Just like starvation is 
the ultimate solution to stomach 
cancer. The comparison with the 
"good old times" docsn't hold , A 
hundred years ago men had all the 
sexual freedom they wanted (pro-
viding they could pay). Women hit 
puberty at 14 and , by the time they 
were 15, they were married. It is 
hard to be promiscuous in these cir-
cumstances! Today. boys and girls 
still hit puberty at 14. but they are 
not married until 23 or 24. 

The argument about the alleged 
inlidelity of my spouse is, I believe. 
a misunderstanding. Of course I 
would rather have a faithful spouse. 
and I, myself. am faithful. My col-
umn was about the way things arc.

article that thoroughly disappointcd 
me. "Tritons Ready for Tourney" 
(Guardian , Oct. 15. 1998) was 
written by John Maynard, who is 
apparently the sports editor. 
Nowhere in this article was it stated 
what team (i ,e. what sport) was 
being discussed! [This is] a disap-
pointing rcpresentation of UCSD. 
especially when you consider that

where to take note of. 

I don ' t mean to come off cold or

Shepard. His death calls forth the 
shadows of other similar deaths. 
Their si lent total mounts while the 
volume of strident political and 
religious rhetoric about morals and 
values is increased. At such an 
occasion as this, the only sound 
appropriate from such corners is 
the sound of grief and shame weep-
ing quietly on each other's shoul-
ders. 

Matthew remains a creation of 
God 's own hand who hore the 
image of hi s creator and who. hy 
virtue of hi s baptism. is indeed my 
brother in Christ. Once llgain the 
message has heen written in blood 
which seeks to silence all IIIho do 
not conform to the norms of the 
kingdoms of this world, norms that 
so often have little to do with 
Christ's kingdom of true righteous-
ness, compass ion and peace, 

Yet there is. I believe. a stronger 
message. It is the message written 
in the blood of the one I know as 
my Lord. It is simply this, that God 
desires fellowship with all of hi s 
chi Idren regard less of alTectional 
orienlati on, regardless or gender, 
regardless of color of skin . It is a 
message that call s the church to 
offer hospitality in the face of th is 
world 's hostility. 

It is my prayer Ihat the light of 
perpetual day in which Matthew 
now basks may shine on and hring 
comfort to his family and fri ends. 
and all who have been bludgeoned 
by word or deed in va lleys of igno-
rance, bigotry and terror. It is also 
my prayer that 1 may renect that 
light by extending an uncondi-
tioned word of welcome and accep-
tance to ALL who desire the fel -
lowship of Jesus Christ.

Keep this fact in mind when you go

First Independently-Elected Mexican Senator Speak~ at IWPS 
TALK: Aguilar discussed 
the relationship between 
Mexico and the U.S. 
By Sula Kim 
Staff Writer 

UCSD eUllllllunit y member, 
gathered at U SD's Intematiollal 
Relations and Pacific Studics 
(IR/P ) Gardner Room last 
Thursday to hear Mex ico 's first 
independently-e lected se na tor 
Adolfo Aguilar Zin;cr speak a!lout 
the problems in Mexican govern-
ment. 

As a leader of democratic 
reform, Agui lar addressed current 
polit ica l and economic change in 
Mexico, Ihe impact it wi ll have on 
the United States and the present 

MEETING: 
Watson also spoke 
with councilmembers 
ContInued frOlll PIIC- 1 
officers resign." 

.o tt 's always a disappoi ntment 
when a counci l member resigns." 
he added. 

In her resignation leller, Juan 
wrote that she resigned due to other 
L:ommitments. 

" l have had some time LO assess 
my priorities and conL: luded that il 
would be unfair for me to devote so 
much time to other things," Juan 
stated. " I sincerely apo logize for 
any disappointment or inconve-
nience I have cau sed." 

Juan said that as a pre-medica l 

relationship between the two coun-
tries. 

In his speech, Aguilar first com-
pared Mexi(;o 10 South Africa and 
then di;cusscd reasons why 
M ex ico ha~ a long way to go for 
~oc i a l and political reform to ta ke 
place. 

" I cou ld teil you that South 
Afri ca is heller off today than 
M exico. The possibility of change 
in Mexico ha, been hard because of 
the problems I have been witne~;­
i ng," he said. 

"Forty - five million M ex icans 
are in povert y. lare] malnourished, 
landlthere is a lot of violcn(;e, bit -
terness and social degradation," he 
added. 

Agui lar ;aid that in spite of the 
fundamental re,ources Mexico has, 

student, she had to make other 
issues a higher prior i ty in her l i fe 

"Time-wise, I didn ' t fee l like it 
was very fair to put A.S. lower on 
my priori ty l ist," she said. 

Juan said she also had other rea-
sons for leaving. 

" I didn ' t have the same kind of 
exci tement that other people in Ihe 
offi ce had," she said. 

Juan appointed Naik assistant 
programmer las t spring. 

Naik said that he is look ing for-
ward to working as the new com-
missioner of programming. 

''(' m really excited," he sa id. 
" As a 'sis(ant programmer [ worked 
really hard 10 make fa ll quarter 
happen." 

Naik said that as commissioner 
of programming he bopes to insti -

the country is lacking in several 
(;ri tical areas. 

"Something is miss ing. We havc 
vitalit y, educalion and talent, and 
wealth, infrastructure and institu-
tion; . Then what do we lack '!" he 
,aid. 

Senator Aguilar ;aid he feci> 
that Mex ico lacks a government 
with leadership and generosil y. 

He said Mexico has the poten-
lial 10 change, adding that he 
believes no one i, leading and set-
ling an example . 

" We don ' t have someone like 
Mandela," Aguilar said. 

He also sa id thm he hopes to 
sec greater invol ve ment by the 
United States in Mexican affairs. 
Agui lar sa id thai the United 
States is physically close enough 

tu te new forms of pUblici ty, have 
more diverse musie on campus and 
push for a stronger programming 
counci l. 

" I rea lly want to work on pub-
licity," he said. " It 's a really big 
problem on campus." 

Naik said that he also hopes to 
include more people in the 
Programming Committee and the 
Advi sory Committ ee to A .S. 
Programming. 

" We want to get more people 
involved," he said. "Our hope is to 
have one representative from each 
of the cultural groups to expand the 
diversity of music, Anyone is invit-
ed to the meetings." 

The position vacated by Naik, 
assistant programmer, is open to 
applicants unti I 2 p.m. on Friday, 

to be a participant in Mexic an 
polilics, and he hopes to sec a 
beller relationship between Ihe 
two nati ons. 

"Our wor,t enemy i, the 
Unit ed States, because the United 
Slates is pressuri ng M ex ico by not 
trusting Mexi(;o," he said. 'They 
arc u; ing Amcrica's polil:e, 
America 's sccurit y, and not allow-
ing Mex i(;o to use th eir own 
forces. " 

I RIPS Profes~o r Richard 
Feinberg said he was impressed by 
Aguilar's speech. 

"Se nator Adolfo Aguilar is not 
afraid to criticile his government 
when they are corrupt ," he said. 
" And there is inequality of soc ial 
and economic justice." 

" He is u man of consdousness 

O(; \. 30th. Naik said that interviews 
for the position wi ll be held on 
November 3rd and 4th. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watso n also 
addressed the A.S. counci l and took 
quest ions from A.S. members at 
last night 's meeting. 

Watson mai n Iy spoke about the 
future growth of UCSD . He sai d 
that enrollment will increase within 
the next ti ve to ten years. 

" UCSD is about to go into its 
ti nal growth spurt ," he said. "After 
that, there wi ll only be room for an 
addit ional 1500 students. Our faci l-
ities need to be expanded." 

Watson said that he believes 
there is a need to plan ahead to 
accommodale future growth. 

" We've been able to keep up 

and high moral. Aguilar choose~ 
truth to power," he said. 

UCSD alumnus Pedro LaFarga 
said he was not impressed by the 
senator's speech because it was not 
what he had hoped to hear. 

,·It was not what [ expected," 
LaFarga said. " I cxpccted a 
grenade launch. He didn' t come 
around as a strong individual. He i ~ 
too passi ve," 

Senator Agui lar is a graduate of 
Harvard Univer~ity 's John F. 
Kennedy School of Governmenl 
and EI Coh:gio de M ex ico. He has 
studied issues regarding M.:xico's 
internali onal relalions, the orlh 
American Free Trade Agrecment 
(NArIA), Guatemalan refu gees in 
Mexiw and other Central 
Am.:rican problems. 

with growth because we've antici -
pated iI," he said. 

Watson said he has included 
planning for the expansion of hous-
ing and student faci l ities at the top 
of his l ist of goals for th is year. 

Watson and the counci lmem-
bers also discussed the fu ture relo-
cation or Roosevelt College to the 
north side of campus and the poten-
tial parking problems such a move 
may create. 

"Park ing is one of the issues Ihat 
constantl y comes up," he said. 
"Thi s campus wi ll be having an 
increased parking problem. The 
so lutions arc not dear and often 
quite complex." 

Watson said that there is the 
poss ibility that plans for a second

Earfood: Already making its mark in college radio , Earfood is planning a tour that 
extends from Southern California to Minnesota. 

EARFOOD FOR THOUGHT 
Ear/ood talks about their ecclectic sound and tastes 
By Tristan Wand 
Guardian Reporter 

II 's 8 p.m. on Sunday evening and the 
band Earfood is hanging around ou tside 
KSDT, UCSD 's studenl -run television and 
radio station, smoking Camel Lights and 
absorhing themselves in the promo posters 
that adorn the station 's windows. A small 
entourage of friends and family have come 
out to support the band, which is gellin g 
ready to playa quit:k sct for UCSD televi-
sion. 

The members of Earfood arc a soft spoken 
bunch in their early 20s, who look as if they 'd 
blend in perfet:tly here on campus. But make 
no mistake, their music is a far cry from their 
mellow demeanors - it positively rages. 
Troy Amidon, lead vocalist and the main 
spokesperson for the band, describes the Ear-
food's unique sound as "omnigroove," which 
also happens to be the name of their record 
label. 

Sound sli ghtl y esoteric? Hopefully so, 
because Enrfood's brand of music incorpo-
rates a wide range of styles including funk , 
jazz, groove, ailemative and psychadelia. 

"We' re trying to get away from classifica-
tions - who knows, maybe one day omni-
groove will be the next phrase people use to 
describe what allernalive was ," Amidon 
explained while the other band members nod 
in agreement. 

Not surprisingly, Earfood 's musical innu -
ences arc a, varied as the Beatles, Jimi Hen-
drix , Miles Davis, Santana, Pink Floyd, Peter 
Tosh and the Grateful Dead. Their sophomore 
elTon , Tal't)' Treats, is a powerful tribute to 
Earfood's diverse inlluences. This tasty blend 
may not immediately . kyrocket to Ihe top of 
the Billboard chans or grace the pages of 
Rolling Stone, hut fame and fortune arc not 
the primary goals of the San Diego-based 

quartet , which features Amidon on lead 
vocals , Thomas Enrique7 on lead guitar, Davl: 
Oehler on pl:n.:uss ion and Chancy Bryant on 
bass. 

"It 's more about gelling OUI there and 
playing to lots of peop le," Amidon sa id enthu-
siasti cally. 

Indeed, while their latest LP is a strong 
studio effort, the most notahle cuts being the 
extra funky trat:k "Falli ng for You" and the 
passionate "E verything ," Earfood's forte 
undoubtedly lies in their live performances. 
Their highly energetic shows have garnered 
quite a reputation within the local under-
ground music scene. Earfood 's hour-long set 
at KSDT made it blatantly dear why they 
have attracted a devoted local following . 
Their UCSD-broadcast performance was 
composed primarily of material off the new 
album, but also induded some awesome jam 
segments and wicked improvisation . On a 
side note, Earfood allows taping of its live 
performances. 

For those who missed the Sunday night 
edition of KSDT's "Noise Box," Earfood is 
in the midst of planning a fall tour that will 
include dates from here in Southern Califor-
nia to as far as Minnesota. This i an up-and -
coming band you won't want to miss. It has 
already made its mark on college radio, and 
one t:an expect to henr more from these 
guys. 

Of course, if the upcoming tour is to he a 
success, Oehler may have to improve his diet. 
As the superlanky drummer returns from hi s 
fourth trip to the vending machine brandi sh-
ing a Snicker's bar, Amidon remarks, "Seri-
ously though, when we go on tour, we have to 
pack lots of good stufr." 

"Ding Dongs." Dave responds.

POETRY BEHIND BARS

As the opening shot of the D.C. sky line 
takes a nose-dive down the face of a briek wall ,

Many times she rallies off a line that admits

The story foll ows the verhally tal enled Ray-
mond Jo~hua (Saul Williams) who demon-
s trate~ how language can cross physical liml1~. 

De~pite his skill" Joshua linds himself thmst 
into prison on a pelly drug t:harge. As a result 
of his brief stay and impending senlence, he's 
forced to grapple with the true delinition of 
freedom and its relationship to his passion of 
language. 

The title of the movie comes from lhe pop-
ular spoken-word contests popping up around 
the country, where artists unleash a hyhrid of 
prose, poetry, rap and performance an . 
Williams is a reigning champion. and it shows. 
Hi s ability to transform his himself into a 
metaphor-spewing Tasmanian devil in a mailer 
of seconds makes scenes explode with enjoy-
able intensity, without ever feeling phony or 
contrived.

that frustration comes through in her cxasper- I

Marc Levin directs with inlimat:y, utilizing 
sudden zooms and blurs to t:reate a grilly doc-
umentary style that gets inside every conversa-
tion . It 's daustrophobit:, but that makes the 
poetry breathe. 

In the movie 's be~t scene, Joshua is sur-
rounded by angry inmates. Just as they are 
about to pounce on him, he launches into a ver-
baltimde that begins as a desperate distraction 
to postpone hi s eminent beating and ends as a 
deeply profound comment ary on society. Hi s 
arms nail , hi, words Ily, and yet there is :In 
underlying ten,ion under each sy llabic. It's 
never clear i I' the baddies are buying the act, 
but eat:h word i~ more meaningful than the lasl. 
!-;lis art has become bOlh survival and sermon 
- he is performing for hi, life, but also for the 
lives or anybody who listens. 

The scene works because the poetry ri ngs 
true. When Joshua ralli es off the line, "Stealing 
us was the best thing they ever did ," it is hon-
est and powerful. Hi s sheer presence gives a 

But it's the soulful performance of the 
promising Williams thai make, the movie. His 
eyes lend more meaning to si lence than any 
other actor in ret:ent r.lemory. Inside a prisoner 
transfer van, the inmate seated next to him 
begins screami ng ohsceni ties. Joshua calmly 
asks, "You scared man'!" But it's what he does-
n't say that gives hi s words punch; hi s eyes 
give away just how afraid he is. 

"Slam" is that rare film that somehow man-
ages 10 preach without seeming preachy, thai 
hreaks free of clit:hcs without losing the raw 
power of drama. There is a rhythm moving 
through every thread of the movie, whether it 's 
pounded out on the inside of an empty ce ll or 
hidden discretely in the dialogue of two fru s-
trated lovers. When Joshua strolls through the 
ci ty streets there's even a rhythm to hi s step, as 
If he's finding some sort of intrinsic beauty in 
the mundane. And even though hi s redemption 
is through hi s suffenng, the movie is about 
how to slap running in order to be free. At one 
point he says, "All I need is a pen and a pad." 
Just as the children arou nd him practi t:e rap-
ping as a way to escape Ihe ghello they were 
hom into, Joshua's freedom of mind transcends 
the pri son that locks him in .

WALTZING THE NIGHT AWAY 
Students have a rising interest in ballroom dancing 
By Michael Last 
Guardian Reporter 

For all those who envy the days of formal 
dancing - complete with sweeping steps and 
sweaty palms - never fear. On October I~ , 
the Ball room dance cluh at UCS D hos ted a 
very succesful night of eclectic ballroom 
dance and is planning on doing it again. 

Finally approved as an Olympic event in 
1997, ballroom dam:lI1 g is starting to gain 
rccogllllion as a sport. Surprised'! When 
thinking of Ihis "sport ." many people conjure 
up mental pi ctures of old men and women 
doing such dances as the wal tz or foxtrot. 
Thal image i, far from detining the modern 
world of hallroom dance. 

College students arc involving themselves 
with ballroom dance in increasing number~. 
whether for exercise. cu ri()~it y. a lo ve of 
dance or an opportunity to meet people. Over 
120 peop le attended thi s recent ballroom 
dance event at UCSD . 

These students ha ve realil.eJ that hall room 
dance is not what it used to be. For starters, 
this style has evolved to include a far wider 
'cope of dances. Ball room dance competi -
tions include entries fro m such dances a, 
wa ltz, fox -trot. rumba. tango. cha chao ,wi ng. 
lindy hop, jive and more. 

So how docs one ballroom dance? The 
dances consist of a set of steps that works well 
wi th musIc of a particular beat. In effect. by 
learning a ballroom dance, you lap th.: experi -
ences of other dancers to determine what 
moves best fit which music. Most dances 
have a hasic foot pattern of between 3 and ~ 
counts lhat can be repealed indefinitely. Mul-
tiple varialions exist. which give the dance its 

suhstance. 
When IIrst lea rning a n.:w Jance one usu-

ally repeats the basic pattern , occasionally 
tryi ng out one of a small set of variations the 
couple has learned. As experience with a 
dance progresses, more and more frequent 
variations can be used, until the dance con-
,ists pri mari Iy of the variati ons, and very 
rarely of the basic pattern . Thi, progre 's 
result in a dance that looks complicated and 
entirely unlike the heginning moves an inex-
peri enced dancer knows. 

Ballroom dances are divided up into a 
numher of categoric,: Latin , smooth. swing 
and nightclub. Latin and ,mootb arc further 
suhdi vided into American anu internati onal 
style,. Stereotypicallll,wc l11 ents. ~uch as lox-
lrot, waltl. and tango. arc smooth dance,. Th.: 
dillcrences hetween international anJ Ameri -
can ,month styles an.: primarily stylistic. such 
as which foot begins the dance. 

ha cha, rumba, jive and samba arc Lati n 
dances. Again, there arc styli, tic dilTercrI';es 
between American and international versions. 
Swing dances inc lude lindy hop, cast coast 
swing and west coasl swing (the offi cia l state 
dance of Californ ia). Nightclub includes such 
dunces as the t wo-,tep and th (! hustle, made 
lamous by John Travolta in "Saturday Night 
Fever." 

For students interested in this type of 
dance. the Ballroom Dance Club at UCSD is 
putting on one more dancee thi s quarter on 

ov. 8. The dan<.:i ng wi " l a~ t from 7 to 10 
p.m. in Price enter Ballroom B.

Red Hot + Rhap50dy 
The Gershwin Groove 

..... Hoi OrPnIIJlllon 

-****, 
The Ger.v/llvill Groove is a com-

pilation album that manages to stay 
together, effortlessly alternating 
between smooth swing jazz and 
hip-hop without losing its structure 
or balance. This t:Oncept alhum 
contains modern artists covering 
George Gershwin classics, normal-
ly a risky proposition. But some-
how it works, and works beautiful-
ly. 

From Morcheeha and Hubert 
Laws' breathy opening intcrpreta-
tion of "Summertime," to the 
atmospheric and creepy David 
Bowie and Angelo Badalamenti 
cuver of "A Foggy Day" - which 
incorporates a 40-piece orchestra 
- the album never slips into cov-
ering for Ihe sake of covering. It 
feels like the artists put thought 
into each track, as if they're actual -
ly enjoying themselves. 

The e artists aren ' t paying trib-
ute; they' re blending a century of 
musical styles and redefining the 
face of pop in the process.

Brand Nubl.ns 
Foundation 

AIIat. 

-***~ 
If you missed the Brand u 

wave hack in th ' day, jump on it 
now. Arter a few )'l!l.lrs of being on 
hiatus, Brand uhian has reunit ed 
on thdr new album, I--Olllldatioll. 

Thi s veteran hip-hop quartet 
includes agile lyricists Alamo and 
Lord lamar. However, most listeners 
are probab ly more familiar with the 
smooth stylings of Grand Puba and 
thc crisp vocals of Sadat X, whose 
solo careers blossomed hrielly while 
the band was disbanded. 

The majority of Foundation's 
tracks were produced hy di fferent 
members of the group. Production 
wizards 01 Premier, Lord Finesse 
and Diamond 0 eat:h represent 
themselves by injecting their signa-
ture styl es on a few tracks. 

The lirst released single, and 
second track, of the album is "The 
Return." Produced by OJ Premier, 
thi s 'ong is flooded by clements of 
Gangstarr-esque beat. The video is 
already on rOlation on the few hip-
hop video shows, such as BET's 
"Rap City." 

Fans can allay their feilrs thai 
this is another onc-hit albulll. Brand 

uhian 's years of experience arc 
apparent , and at least two-Ihirds of 
the tracks are radio worthy. 

The album 's themes run the 
gamut from pat1y joints to love. The 
anecdotal track "Probable Cause" 
discusses police brutality. Founda-
tion is an ecumenical collection. 

In a time when many rap albums 
indude so many ex traneous artists 
that you forget whose album it is, 
Brand Nubian keeps it concise with 
one cameo by Common and one by 
Busta Rhymes. In essence, they've 
still got it. .

FOLK MUSIC ANYONE? 
Musicians follow the folk tradition and play for charity at the Thomas Paine Cafe 
By M.ca. Scott 
Guardian Reporter 

It was a folky, Friday night. The 
small, familiar crowd at Thomas 
Paine Cafe was very supportive to 
the performers. The show was five 
hours of local folk performers, 
mainly women accompanied hy 
small ensembles, Admission was 
only five dollars and in the folk tra-
dition of helping the community, 
the proceeds were donated to San 
Diego AIDS-related charities. 

The performances were truly 
uplifting because the musicians had 
something to share and loved doing 
it. There were no ulterior motives 
of making millions or becoming the 
next teen idol. There was no for-
mality, yet the show was profes-
sional. The arti sts would casually 
walk on and off stage, and many 
could be seen in multiple bands. 
Instead of relying on specia l 
effects, the performers impressed 

. the audience with pure talent and 
personality. 

One memorable group was a tra-
ditional folk trio with Cici .porter on 
rhythm acoustic gui tar, David Bid-
bock on acoustic lead guitar and 
Wayne Nelson on acoustic bass All 
three sang tight. blended, and crc-
ative harmonics. The music was 
upbeat and POrler 's voice was 
clear. strong and heautiful. 

Redwoods, a hand famil -
iar to the local har sccne, 
sang s ngs with definit e 
story lines. Each song 
contained an elusive, Amcri-

can-dream feeling. in true Padre 
spirit, Redwoods also lead the 
crowd in a country, heart-warming 
rendition of "Take Me Out to the 
Ball Game." 

The most eclectic and memo-
rable performance of the evening 
came from the Beth Ladwick Band, 
titled after the lead singer. The 
vocalist and rhythm guitar player 
was quite intriguing. While her 
speaking voice was average, her 
singing voice was very distinct. She 
sounded like Jewell on helium. The 
music, songs abou t the urge to gel 
high, appealed mostl y to the 
younger audience members. 

The group's craziest member 
was the drummer. He dressed all in 
black with a beret, and wore a sin-
gle drum between his legs. 
Throughout the performance, he 
theatri cally and abstract ly danced 
arou nd the stage, played other 
band members' heads 
as drums and 

made shadow puppets on the wall. 
The Beth Ladwick Band has 

promise, it just needs experience. 
As these musicians become more 
comfortable on sLage and with each 
other, the audience will be able to 
focus more on the music and appre-
ciate the nailings of the Parisian 
boogie drummer. Their CD can be 
bought at Tower records. 

A CD called Ocean; a ce lebra-
tion of San Diego Women 's Music 
was also on sa le at the concert. 
Many of the women featurcd on the 

CD performed on Friday night. All 
of the proceeds from thi s CD will 
benefit San Diego AIDS-related 
charities. The CD, however, is not a 
fair representation of women 's 
music in San Diego. 

It consists of 16 tracts, of which 
14 are folk songs. After studio mix-
ing and producing, these 14 songs 
sound more like easy- listening 
country than folk music. Taken out 
of the live selling, the songs lose 
their intimate and raw feel. 

Also, in a technological era 
where studros allow singers to har-
monize with themselves and wt 
and paste good takes, blended and 
difficult harmonies are only

ueSD CWB SPORTS UPDATE 
Not all of UCSD's LOp athletes are involved in 

!ntercollegiate Athletics - some of these heroic 
men and women can be found in UCSD's Club 
Sports program as well. 

For those athletes not in the mainstream, or 
those who participate in sports nQt sanctioned by 
the NCAA, UCSD offers a 
plethora 'of Club Sports, 
ranging from surting, to 
ballroom dancing, to 
lacrosse, to ultimate disk. 

Though these sports do 
'r nqt , c~ntril/Ute_ f , lj~~D 's , 
: Se,ar , "Y:UIl , tajly" ,. ~e 

Guardian sports department 
feels that these athletes 
deserve to be recognized 
alongside their NCAA coun-
terparts. After al1, these Club 
SportS athletes often put in 
the same amount of hours 
and make just as many sacri-
fices for their sport as the 
Intercollegiate athletes do. 

For this reason, the Guardian 
will offer weekly updates (space 
permitting) about the performances of our Club 
Sport programs. So keep with it. Read the 
Guardian and find out who ripped during this 
weekend's Surf Team season opener at Huntington 
Beach and who scored first at Saturday's fITst-ever 
official UCSD women 's rugby game at Stanford 
University.

ULTIMATE DISC 
This weekend. while mOSl people are basking in 

that late October sun, seven members or the UCSD 
men 's ultimate disc team, affectionately known ;c, 
the "Air Squids:' will be ~pending four days III 
Sarasota, Fla., at the Open ationals - the premier 
evenl in ultimate diSC. 

The select Air quids will join forces with Lhe 
San Diego-based club Learn Los Guapos. This is a 
particularly peeial event as Los Guapos is one of 
two teams Lhat will attend Lhe event from the 
Southwest Region - a region that includes 
Colorado, ew Mexico, Arizona and southern 
California. 

In Sarasota, the Squids will face the top ultimate 
disc teams in the nation . This competition will not 
only be an experience in its own light. but the tour-
nament will also give the Squids a val uable head-
start on preparations for the collegiate season . 

"Having seven returning players compeLe at the 
club national level wi 11 give the Squids experience 
Lhat will give us the edge in the co llege season," 

Squids Co-captain James "Jamie" Town said. 
Last year, the Air Squids finished a team-best 

sixth place at the national collegiate level, and are 
seeking to move up even further this year. 

"Our team has \I lot of young talent mixed in 
with experience from the older squids," Co-captain 
John "Silver" Watkinson said. "With the potential 
our new recruits have. we could c;stablish ourselves 
as a top competitor once again." 

In Florida, the competition will be 
fierce. The Squids .will face oppo-

nents that have had 10 to 15 years 
of playing experience com-

pared to UCSD's team-
members ' three to four 

years at the college 
level . However, their 
lack of experience is 
replaced by a strong 
level of athleticism 
and a high respect 

for ultimate disc. 
According to 
Watkinson, this 
respect, which is 

often absent at the club level, makes 
ultimate disc a unique sport. 

'''Spirit of the game' is a phrase that encom-
passes that positive attitude ullimate players have 
for one another," Watkinson said. 

He also said that the Air Squids are well known 
for their high level of spi rit on and off the field , 
making the team one of the best-known groups to 
play for and again t. 

Arter th is weekend's East Coa t excursion the 
Air Squids will be idle until they take the lield on 
Nev. 21, dunng the Southern California Wann Up 
on MUIr Field.

"It went from (}v(;rhead to well

He also said that because he is a

"goofy-footed" surfers. he had to 
he coaxed into paddling into the 
higger waves. 

" I was dclini te ly peer pres. ured

Alter the eight-day G-Land 
excursion, the two returned hack to 
KUla to catch a night home. 

Though Nauenberg caught 
some of the hest waves of his life, 
the surf' was not the only memo-
rable thing about the trip . He was 
also inspired hy the Indonesian 
people. 

"The Indonesians are insanely 
nice," Nauenberg said. "But to 
them you are just an insanely rich 
person who could give them a cou-
pic of bucks Which would pronably 
feed their whole family for I n 
entire week . They know how little 
two dollars means to you and how 
much it means to thelll . But that 
aside, they are insanely good-
natur(;d people." 

Samuels also rcllected on the 
trip. 

" It is so good to get out of 
southern California and redi scov-
er what surfing really i ' ," Samuels 
said . "Surling in San Diego has 
hecome a skatehoard park . 
Everyone'.s doing chop-/wps and 
airs and nobody's making allY 
turns. In In<.lo, it 's lotally differ-
ent. It \ so heavy there that it 
makes you surf how you're sup-
posed to."

painfully lethargil.: ride. 

As they rounded to w rner to G-

ENDEAVOR 
"'Freedom 

Found" 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

UCS D ~e lll o r Sander 
I auenberg spent the end of his 
summer worrying about ma lari a. 
For three week s in September. 
Nauenberg and fellow UCSD 
seni ors, Rick Cowley and LeWIS 
Samuels, traveled Ihe I ndone, ian 
islands seart hing for reeli ng lelb . 
For three weeks , auenberg fretted 
about the pesky Indonesian mos-
quitoes, and was constantly app ly-
ing coat aft er coa t of Deet. 

"I was definitely loved hy mos-
quitoes," Nauenberg said . ''There 
were mult iple times that I wa~ sure 
that I was going to get malaria -
24-7. I wa, covered in Deet." 

The three never caught malaria 
(though Naucnberg is still popping 
Malari um ), but they did get ,orne 
sk k waves. 

Nauenherg. ow ley anu 
Samuels , tarted their trip ' in KUl a, 
the b igge~ t city on the i, land of 
Bali. From Ibere. Ihe three drove 
IOward the coaSI. where Ihey stayed 
in a cheap hOlel - l!verything is 
cheap in Indo, a~lc nbe rg said -
that rronted the left ree l' hreak. lIu 
Watu. At Ullu 's, a siro ng swell 
awa ited them, and Ihey , urfed 
clean ha rrels all day. 

"The waves were hig and solid; 
at leasl overhead to overhead and a 
half," auenberg said. 

Though Ihe surf wasn' t large. by 
Indones ian slandards, Nauenherg, 
originall y fro m Santa ·ruz. ~aid 
thai he was caught oft guard hy the 
speed and the heav ine'i s of Ihe 
waves. 

"There IS no wave in sout hern 
Calirornia that compares 10 the way 
it breab in Indo." Nauenherg said. 

The nex i day, the trio hl!aded 
out for another island. Nauenberg 
sa id Ihat he did not wa nllo disc lose 

the name of the island becau ~e he 
had promised Cowley, who look 
them to the ~ IX) I . that he would not 
reveal i t ~ location . 

auenberg, Cowley and 
Samuel!> reached Ihe ~cc rct i~ l a nd 
via fcrry hoat , whi ch Nauenberg 
, aid wa, an ex pcricm:e III it s sel f. 
He .. a Id thai I he boats were 
"siinky" and dangerously over-
c rowded and leaned to one side the 
en tire ride. 

Nauenhcrg said thai Cowley 
made best of the ~i t ua l ion with his 
dazz ling renditi ons of Indones ian 
pop songs that he wai led I hro ugh 
the ferry's ka raoke machine. 
Nauenbcrg slated Cowley's' perfor-
mance on Ihe boat as being "clas-
sic." 

AI the sec ret spot , the ~ urf 
turned out 10 be evcn hetter Ihan 

Third in a 
Three-Part eries 

Cowley's sin ging. They surfed 
uncrowded and "insane lefts" for 
eight days . 

"We surfed our hrai n, out ." 
N auenhcrg ~a id . 

After a week of comlanl surf-

ing, the three dec ided 10 delve into 
the Indonesian night life. They 
returned to Hotel Crysta l, for a 
Salurday-ni ght disw. 

" It wa~ rag ing," Nauenberg said. 
''The place wa~ packed with 

I nd () nc~ i an ~ .... We w"rl! Ihe onl y 
white people." 

Though the scene wus coo l, 
auenherg hud amhi valent feelings 

towa rd the mu~ i c. 
" Imagine every song you've 

heard, lurned di sco," auenberg 
~a i d . "They even had di sco ve r~ i o ns 
of Guns 'N Rose,." 

Despi te va rious attempts, 
Naucnberg said thaI he did not 
"hook up" and we nt home 
disheveled. 

Arter HOlel Crystal. the three 
planned to returned to Bali, which 
ended up being their "port of call:'

s we lls that hit the Indonesian coastline during its winter season. In the background is G-Land. 

However, Ihe ir tickets we re open-
ended, and only Cowley was ab le 
to gct on the fl ight. 

Cowley, who had pr e vi ously 
resided for a year in Indo, wcnt on 
without Samuels and Nauenbcrg. 
and was nol 10 he hea rd of again 
until lhc fli ghl homc. 

Na uenbcrg and Cowley caught a 
fli ghl back to Bali Ihl! nex i day 
where the two rented a car and 
drove to Padang Padang. 

At Padang. they stayed "in a li t-
tle hole in the wai L" bUI their li vi ng 
situati n WilS more than compen-
sated for by consistenl surf. 

"We surfed Padang, and Bingin 
and Ullu's again: ' Nauenberg said. 
"It never gOl under head-high." 

When they were not , urting. Ihe 
two visited the Ullu temples, but 
did not do much sightsee ing olhcr 
than that. 

"You get lazy in Indo:' 
Nauenberg said. "You just feel likc 
chilling. We would eal a lot or Ihe 
time - but not much because the 
meals were rca II y small - or elsl! 
we would j ust read old su rf maga-

Men Score 4 in Win 
EASIER: After a double OT win, men coast to a 4-1 victory 
By Travis Hili 
Associare Sporrs Ediror 

Remember when you were a little kid on 
Christmas Day (for all of you who do nO( cel-
ebrate Chri stmas. use your birthday) and after 
you opened all or your presents you asked 
your parents, "Why can 't it be Chri slmas 
every day'!" 

Inev itabl y, your parent s told you 
Ihat if it were Christmas every 
day, you wo uld nOI trul y 
appreciate it. As a mat ler of 
ract, yo u would even get 
bored with it after awhile . 
While your parents' logic made 
sense, you still thought it wo uld be cuol if 
it were Chri stmas every day. 

The same log ic applies to the UC SD 
men's soccer team's last IWO games. Last 
Saturday'S 1-0 double overtime thriller ove r 
Dominican Uni versity (III.) was amazing and 
last Monday's 4-1 win over a decidedly bad 
Occ idental College was not exactly 
Chri stmas, a lthough the UCSD fans on hano 
wished it could have been. 

The fac t o f the matter is that it was a three-
goal win and that is the most important thing 
for Head Coach Derek Armstrong ;Ind hi s 
troops. It just wasn't the pretti est ga me. 

"Well , aft er a great game like the one 
against Dominican . you have to expect a little 
letdown:' Ass istant Head Coac h Ted 
Pr7.ybylek sai d. 

The Occidental match came onl y two days 
aft er the grueling battle wilh Dominican und 
the Trilons were a bit tired. 

Fatigue did not deter them from working 
ex tremely hard against the Tigers on Monday 
evening. Juni or midlielder Cameron Adams 
got in the trenches all night and recorded two 
goal s. Sophomore midlielder Shanne Sleder 
and j unior midlielder Tyler Korman each net-
ted their lirst goals of the season for Ihe 
Trit ons. 

The Tritons knew that Occidental was nol 
going 10 be very tough as they came into La 
Jo lla sporting a /-9- 1 record . 

Normall y. after a double-overti me war and 
some lougher matches on the hori zon. a team 
could overlook a team li ke Occ idental. The 
Tri tons, however. had something very impor-
tant to play for. They were on the verge of 
going over the .500 mark for the season for 
Ihe first time since earl y September. Wilh a 
win, the Tritons would up thei r record to 7-6-
I on Ihe season. 

They more Ihan accomplished that goal. 
Occidenlal rea lly never had a chance as 
UCSD got on the board in the ninth minute. 
Senior mid fie lder Bryan Song, who has been 
playi ng out standing soccer lately, fired a shot 
at the Tige r goalkeeper. The keeper made the 
save, hut he could not co nt rol it and Sleder 
was in the ri ght place at the right time and 

SEARS: 
The cup will be revealed 
thi s Saturday 
Continued from page 32 
the College o f New Jersey and Cortland State 
University, which ti ed for second . National 
Championships from the three-time defend-
ing National Champion women's soccer team 
and the women's vo lleyball team put the 
Tritons over the top. 

The soccer and vo lleyballleams didn 't win 
the cup on their own. however. Addilionally, 
nine other UCS D teams fini shed in the lOp 20 
in NCAA Div ision))) championships, includ-
in g men's swimming and di vi ng (2 nd), 
women's swimming and di ving (3rd), men's 
go lf (5 th), women's tennis (9th ), men's tenn is 
(9th), men's outdoor track and Iidd (13th), 

men ' ~ cross country (16th ), women's basket-

slotted the ricochet. 
After that goal, many in att endance 

assumed UCSD would score at least three or 
four more in the tirst half. The Tigers, though, 
began to snarl back. They were not going to 
be embarrassed like their women's team, who 
got blasted last week by CSD, 10-0. The 

Tigers sal a bevy of defenders bac k for the 
rest of the ti rst half and tried to counter 

UCSD 's allac ks. 
It was a logical strategy and 

it almost worked as Occidental 
created some dangerous 
opportunities. It looked for a 

moment as if CSD was rea lly 
going to miss the loss of senior co-

captain John Brandon. who was held out 
of hi ' second straight gamc as a safety pre-
caution for the concussion he suffered last 
week. 

However, star goalt ender Lucas Curtolo 
and defenders Jamie Lutton. Tyler Thompson 
and Jacob Boll inger held orr the Ti ger attack 
and kcpt the shutout al halftime. 

In the second hall', the Tiger scrambled 
for much of the time, and their lack of skill 
was apparent and mistakes were prevalent. 

According to tht: players and the fan s, the 
re reree also made mistakes. Bernard dis put -
ed one of the referee's margi nal ca ll s. and 
holl ered so much abusive language thai he 
was red-carded by the unapprecialive refer-
e\! . 

That too k some of the push out of thl! 
Trilons' attac k. but they sti II managed to lake 
advanlage of a Tige r miscue in the 61 st 
minute as Adams scored hi s ti rsl goa l on a 
nice cross from Sleder. 

Then Korman scored hi s goal minules 
later. There was a pileup near the Tiger nel 
after the Tritons created a nice opportunity, 
and Korman managed to come out of the 
scrap with the goal. 

Less than a minute later, however, the 
Tigers got a goal aft er a Tri ton de rensive mi x-
up. That goal secmed 10 wake up the Tritons 
and for the rest of the match they played 
smarter, more controlled soccer. 

U D began to put more pressure on the 
Tiger nel and cnded up drawing a penalty 
ki ck in Ihe g th minute, whi ch Adams 
promptl y blasted into th e back of the net for 
the fourth and linal goal. 

The Tritons have now won rour straight 
contests and have a dangerous home match 
on Saturday at 2 p.m. at RIM AC Field against 
U.S. International Uni versity. a school known 
ror its abil ily to upset any team on any given 
day. UCSD's task will be made even more 
di rricu lt with the loss or Bernard . 

It will be UCSD's Homecoming, though, 
and there will be tons of fans and alumni 
there to support the Tritons. making their task 
a litt le easier. 

ball (17th) and rencing (17th). 
U SD was al so the lirst Division III uni-

versity to win the Sears Directors' Cup with-
out fi elding a foo tball team. 

"Sears is honored to be a part of co llegiate 
alhletics excellence," John H. Costello, Sears 
senior executi ve vice president or marketing 
sa id. "UCSD's Sears Directors' Cup victory 
shows that great minds and athletes go hand

Jon Lawson, a local Scars store general 
manager and a former UCSD rowing coach. 
will present Ihe $35,000 Walerford Crystal 
cup 10 the univers ilY. 

So enjoy this weekend 's festi viti es . Go to 
the water polo. volley ball and the soccer 
games, and make sure you are there on 
Saturday at North Campus Field (RLMAC) by 
2:45 p.m. to be a part or history. Michael

Jacob Gordon 
Padre Fans Aren't 
Real Fans 

All right folks, I'm as exci t-
ed as you are that the World 
Series has l:ome to an Diego, 
but I am sil:k and tired of thi s 
ci ty right now. Padre-thi s and 
Pad re-that ! Everywhere you go 
now people love the Padres. 
Basicall y, I think I can boil it 
down to just one thing: PADRE 
FANS AR STU PID. 

Now don ' t get me wrong, I 
like the Padres. I really do. I 
think it 's cool that am my can 
play when one of hi~ arms is out 
of the sock~t and when his left 
leg needs replacing. I admire . 
Vaughn 's towering homer~ and 
Finley 's jumping catche~ . I like 
Wally 's an'd Leritl 's bald head . 
and no on~ cun ignore Tony 's 
sweet swing or HolTman '!> 
smooth change-up. But it ' ~ the 
fu ns here. They 're just so T -
PID! 

Why the sudden love affair 
with the Swi ngi n' Friars? ne 
reason and one reason alone: 
Because they arc in the World 
Series. I bet 75 percent of the 
people in San Diego can't even 
name the manager of the team. 
All of a sudden, it's very chic to 
go driving around with "Go 
Pads" plastered on your wind-
shield . 

All the attention on baseba ll 
and the Padres thi s year ha!> 
backlired. Something is obvi-
ously wrong when thousands of 
loyal Padre fans wait hours at 
the stadium for tickets only to 
come home empty-handed 
because rich La Jolla business-
men bought them all on 
Ticketmaster for their real estate 
clients. 

Everyone is now a Padre fan . 
While I was watching the game 
yesterday, someone actually 
asked me how many innings 
there were. I damn near hit her. 

Where were all these fabu-
lous Padre fans in '94 when the 
team was stuck in last place by 
12.5 games? Th~y were all on 
the Chargers handwagon o f 
course because the 'Bolts rolled 
all the way to the uper Bowl 
behind Natron "!he end justifies 
the" Means. But now that the 
Pads arc back in vogue, ryin ' 
Leaf and his teammates arc for-
gotten. 

I still think the Padres are 
good. They arc my second 
favorite team. II just so happens 
they are playing my favorite 
team in the Series. The Padres 
are good, not great, and this year 
the Yankees are just so obvious-
ly beller that I wish all you SD 
fans would just quit your 
whinin ' and go home. 

The Yankees may be one of 
the greate t teams in hi story. 
You may be good, but the 
Yankees are the besl. 

OUT.

CUTTING DOWN

been burning many opponents including Monday's 2-1 win against Div. II Humboldt State. 

Monda] night's 
formidable 2 -1 win 
over the Humboldt 
State Lumberj acks 

By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Ever since the discussion about moving 
UCSD's athletic program from Di vis ion II( to 
Division II began, fans and supporters 
alike have expressed their concerns 
over whether the Tritons, rela-
tively underfunded by Division 
III status, will be able to com-
pete against high-caliber play 
from schools like UC Davis 
and UC Irvine. 

Monday, the women 's soccer team 
laid some of these concerns to rest when it 
beat its latest Division II competition by one 
goal. The three-time defending Division III 
National Champions did not just beat the 
Division II opponent , they dominated the 
Humboldt State Lumberjacks. 2- 1. 

On paper, the Lumberja~ks looked to be a 
formidable match for the Tritons because of 
their higher divisional status. On the field, how-
ever, it was a different story. 

"We thought they were goi ng to be better 
than they were," junior co-captain Janine 
Harispe sa id. "They were bigger than we 

ex pected though." 
The Lumberjacks may have been big, but 

the Tritons were in charge as they scored earl y. 
Only eight minutes into the first half. forward 

Christy Abiza id crossed the ball into the 
goal bqx where it was knocked down by 

Ci ndy Dostalek . The ball bounced 
onto the foot of freshman Laura 

Dooley who promptly fired it 
into the back of the net. 

With such an ea rly lead. 
UCSD could have relaxed and made 

themselves vulnerable to a soft goal. 
This Triton squad, though, has come a long 

way si nce the beginning of the year. The veter-
ans have stepped up to lead while the freshman 
have matured wonderfully. This new and 
improved Triton team knew that a one-goal lead 
over a big Division II school is not very secure. 
So instead of givi ng up a goal, they scored 
another one. 

In the 31 st minute, Abizaid blasted a shot that 
the Lumberjack goalkeeper just could not han-
dle. The ball ricocheted outside of the left post to 
midlielder Angie Mann who Ii red it into upper 
ri ght l:Orner, givi ng the Tritons a two-goal advan-

puts Division II 
worries to rest 

tage. UCSD took its 2-0 lead into halftime and 
kept it for most of the second half. Humboldt 
State finally scored on a corner kick in the 71 st 
minute, but it was too little too late, and the 
Tritons held on for their ninth win of the season. 

The Triton squad now has won live in a row. 
During the streak, the Tritons have piled on the 
goals, scoring 25 while allowing only 3. The 
playoffs are still 'not guaranteed. Three impor-
tant games remain are the schedule, including 
Division III games against Vassar (played late 
last night) and Chapman on OCI. 30. 

To secure themselves a spot in the playoffs, 
the Tritons must continue thei r winning ways. 
From their showi ng agai nst tough Division II 
competition, though. maki ng the playoffs looks 
like a safe bet.
