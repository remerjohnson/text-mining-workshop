300 AS ' 
Execs in 
DCFrid~y 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
News Editor 

Student body executives 
from 300 universities and 
college .. across the nation will 
be part of a day long meeting 
Friday in what President 
Carter's office says is an 
attempt to get to "the issues 
and challenges of the 1980's." 

Included among those 
executives will be UCSD AS 
President Carlos Montalvo 
and student body presidents 
from five other UC schools 
and 15 other California 
institutions. 

The student government 
representatives will be brie/ed 
in the morning by President 
Carter's top forei$n and 
domestic aides, Zbignew 
Brzezinski and Stuart 
Eizenstate, first hearing 
prepared speeches by the two, 
then questioning them for an 
hour. 

In the afternoon, the 
students will meet with teams 
of domestic, foreign and 
energy policy advisors from 
various federal agencies and 
the White House. 

The group will then adjourn 
to the East Room of the White 
House to first hear a public 
speech by Carter. They will 
then get a half an hour to ask 
the president questions. 

Carter will not pick up the 
tab for Montalvo's visit,

Radicals Seek Crowd 
With Threat to Flag 

The Revolutionary Communist Party, denied access to 2,500 
people at Monday's rally, drew a crowd of about 100 curious and 
indignant students on Revelle Plaza yesterday at noon. 

I 
M«»t of those watched 1 0 me~ber "f the party pass out leaflets 

or argue with passersby, but an 11 th member (above) carried a 
soiled American flag and held the attention of mo.t observers by 
intermittenly threatening to bum it. 

He never did burn the flag, but said it wasn't because of shouts 
from the crowd that he "decided whether he was going to burn 
the flag 10 we can take it away from you." 

Instead, he said later, he tried but didn't have any lighter fluid 
on hand. 

.... ter calling the flag "a piece of toilet pllper tN.t wipe. the ... 
of the workers," he and the other memben of the party left the 
Iquare chanting. 

Police, who last quarter allowed an Iranian flag to be burned on 
the plaza, told The Daily Guardian they would have stopped the 
worker because it might have "incited a riot."

Many reporters interviewed at the rally 

agreed that the press would take student 
protelt, if it continues to build, much more 
seriously than it did during the 60s, partly 
because reporters working now lived through 
the experience.

Third World Library 
Backed by Saltman 

By Sheila Dowe 
The Student Affirmative 

Action Committe is leading 
the drive for the acquisition of 
a Third World Library, and 
has at least one influential 
supporter - Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Paul 
Saltman. 

Tambuzi said yesterday 
that SAAC is pushing for a 
library using a collection of 
Chicano research materials, 
as well as an Afro-American 
bibliography published by 
Edith Fisher, as the nucleus of 
the library. 

Third World related 
materials donated by the late 
Joseph Sommers presently 
occupy a small section of the 
Clusters Undergraduate 
Library, 

Lorena E. Vasquez has 
acted as a coordinator for the 
project and has sent a letter to 
Saltman asking for space. 

Saltman says he's never 
seen the letter, but said 
yesterday he endorsed the 
concept. 

He had 

however. 
Campus library circulation 

coordinator Sue Galloway has 
estimated the minimum cost of 
operating such a ,library at 
$100,000 a year, and 
Saltman says an expense like 
that will have to be figured in 
with other university priorities. 

CompensaLion from other 
libraries on campus might be 
needed to get the project off 
the ground, Saltman said . 

Tambuzi believes "solidar-
ity" in this effort which would 
give Third World students, as 
well as other minorities, a 
place to research their 
ancestry and alst> to meet 
others of similar backgrounds. 
This would help in the 
"retention of Third World 
students" at UCSD, Tambuzi 
maintained. 

T ambuzi stressed that this 
library would have a focus on 
the Third World culture is 
"usually given a footnote." 
"The library wiU represent a 
"tide of ," he said.

Letter. To The Editor 

So Its 1, 2, 3· What 
Are We Fighting For? 
Editor: 

There is a kind of mentality common in our country and on 
this campus in which people accept what is printed about a 
certain group of people or a country, even when the portrait is of 
the group being evil. It's a Dick Tracy view of the world - good 
guys & bad guys. 

Some would say that there is a need for scapeg oatz. I think 
the reasons are far more complex than that. At one time it was 
accepted that Blacks were subhuman, that the Jews killed 
Christ, the Indians were p.agans and so on. 

During the first World War, the Germans were the bad guys. 
Now it is the godless Communists. They are coming. They are 
taking our preciol.\s freedoms away. We must fight and die to 
protect what we hold sacred. Qie and kill for democracy! ..... The 
United States should continue to lead the west in the defense of 
demoratic ideals throughout the world ... we shuld continue to 
work and possibly to fight for the freedom of the individuals 
everywhere . . . But he {the enemy) is going 10 take too much of 
your freedom, Kill him" (Steve Powell, "Feb. 6Daily Guardian) . 

Jimmy's Acts Follow a Pattern 

The development of an understanding of the evolution of 
political systems, and an understanding of how well these 
systems function given the historical , cultural and educational 
attainment of the people upon which these systems function, is a 
slow, arduous process. This refinement of understanding in 
development of social systems is not common. To wave the 
words - like flags - of "freedom" and "democracy" is an 
indication of the user 's intellectual development. 

Editor: 
It is time to remember our 

lessons from history and pay 
closer attention to the events 
which are occurring today. If 
ams is done, some surprising 
parallel. can be drawn 
between one of this century', 
most brutal abuser. of power 
and the leader of our country 
today. 

President Carter has thi. 
country in a paranoid frenzy 
very similar to the climate that 
existed in Hitler'. Nazi 
Germany. His latest proposal 
- the loosening 01 constraints 
on the CIA, the FBI and the 
NaIionaI Security AIfllllCY and 
the proposed formation of a 
secret court -- confirm this 
route. Other actions Carter 
has been taking should make 
us all the more attentive. 

Like Hitler had hi, cause, 
his goal for the German people 
- their "Lebensraum" -- 10 
too. does Carter with . his 
preservation of oil flow from 
the Middle East as his excuse 
or cause to invade, control, 
manipulate and dominate the 
Persian Gulf and Middle 
Eastern oil.producing nations .. 
15 this not a gross violation of 
national sovereingty as were 

Hitler's invasions of 
Czechoslovakia, Austria and 
Poland? Hitler's cure for the 
ailing German economy was 
to nationalize the industries 
and begin ma .. production of 
war machines. The US 
industrial mobilization and 
Carter's increase in the 
defense budget is a similar 
event,· except in Germany the 
government controlled the 
industry; in the US the indUitry 
has nationalized the 
government. Carter is working 
for the corporate interest and 
cause; our blood will I0OI1 flow 
for such sacred caUies as 
Exxon, Standard Oil, and 
Texas Oil. 

Hitler's fantastic manipula. 
tion of the German masses 
went hand in hand with 
efficient and total media 
propaganda. Today we are 
being blitzed and propagan· 
dized by the media at a no less 
remarkable rate than the Nazi 
influence. Instead of blaming 
Jews, we blame Russians and 
Iranians; instead of marches 
and theatrics at Nuremberg, 
we have a joint session of 
Congress during prime 
viewing time , with everyone all 
dressed up and playing their 

dramabc role for the media as • 
our venerable President asks 
us to unite and follow him into 
a holocaust, this one much 
more destrucJive than Hitler's 
holocaUlt, this one the final 
destruction. 

The cycle is now being 
completed as our Fuhrer lets 
loose his own Secret Service 
with a secret court to catch 
spies in the "national interest," 
and a loosening of restrictions 
on the CIA, the FBI, the NSA. 
We can expect a terror and 
threat similar to that of Hitler's 
Gestapo. We are .now on the 
path of the lOOO-year Reich. 

How can we miss all these 
signposts? 

These lessons of . history 
should have taught us to be 
wary. Shouldn't we have 
learned from our mistakes? 
How can we forget Vietnam? 
How can we forget the 
destruction and waste of 
human lives in World War II? 
How can we forget a maniacal 
leader like Adolf Hitler? How 
can we forget so soon? 

RONALD V. BETTIG 
ANGHARAD N. 

VALDIVIA 

Is there not more democracy in a system that allows for the 
employees to elect their foremen and managers? Ano is not a 
system superior that has as a right for al1equal access to medical 
care, housing, food and transportation? What of the freedoms to 
be without food, housing, employment and medical care? And is 
this country "leading the west in the defense of democratic ideas 
throughout the world,'~ as Powell claims? What kind of 
governments ha ve we helped create in South Korea. Greece, 
Chile, the Dominican Republic, B"razil, Taiwan, Indonesia and 
South Vietnam? 

The question that confronts most of us is what are we being 
called to arms for. Are the Russians about to invade the Middle 
East, as we did in Vietnam? The Russians entered Afghanistan, 
a neighboring socialist country, at the invita~on of the previous 
government. They supposedly helped replace the leadership of 
that country with a government that would institute change at a 
slower pace. They felt that without first raising the consciousness 
of the people, the ideas of land reform, rights for women and so 
on, would only create strife. It took the Soviet. lO years before 
they instituted land refonn in its province bordering on 
Afghanistan. 

Or are we being called to arms because the economy is 
sagging - again - and the on1y way to halt the decline is to 
print money to stimulate the economy? Who benefits most from 
increased military spending? 

What confronts us is not a call to arms but a gross failure of 
this country to progress. Neither has our ~ving standard or 
health standard improved. Our environment has deteriorated, 
and we stand on the brink of global destruction while our 
"leaders" call for more bombs, rockets and soldiers. We need to 
put human welfare ahead of warfare. We need to disarm the 
corporate· military.government complex, and make the world 
safe for democracy. What confronts us is not the Soviets, but our 
own failures and excesses.

Vietnamese aggression, murders or political design. 
One-sided films may be well done technically, but 
they still are propaganda pieces. They do not educate 
in the sense of providing a complete picture of the 
circumstances for the inquiring scholar. 

A true picture of the Vietnamese conflict will show 
aggression on both sides, treachery on both sides and 
oppressive regimes on both sides. Future historians 
will sort out and define which side was the most 
responsible for the conflict. . 

For now , however, we must correct false 
impressions left by the producers of the film . 
American apologists for the North Vietnamese 
ref used to acknowledge expansionist design 0/ all Ho 
Chi Minh-led forces during the 1960's and the early 
1970's. However, North Vietnam expansions and 
territorial exploitation were evident to all fair-minded 
people then and now. 

,ndeed, Vietnam's push for control in Cambodia is 
but present-day evidence of the expansionist fervor 
among the North Vietnamese for nearly three 
decades. Cambodians have been killed and 
plundered as a result of Vietnam's actions, just" as 
thousands of South Vietnamese died as a result of 
North Vietnam's push into South Vietnam. 
Apologists for Vietnam's Communist rulers mUlt be 
ask'ed how t~y can defend the killing, plundeting 
and murders of both South Vietnamese and 
Cambodians. 

Of those apologists who scorn the United States 

for its involvement with the South Vietnamese 
government, we must ask why that is any different or 
any worse than the Soviet Union's involvement with, 
and likely control of, the North Vietnamese 
government or the present Vietnamese government. 
If outside political involvement is wrong, as 
suggested by "Hearts and Minds ," why sbould that 
accusation be directed at only one side of the 
equation - specifically, the US-South Vietnamese 
ioint effort? Surely equal accusations must be 
directed toward the Soviet· Vietnamese alliance. 

Did the South Vietnamese government have the 
right to resist what it perceived to be an invasion of, or 
aggression alainst ita territory? Do Cambodians 
loyal to the Pol Pot government have the right to 
resist an invasion by forces controlled and directed 
from outside Cambodian boundaries. Rhetorical 
questions such a. these can be answered in several 
ways, of course. But several ways sugge.t more 
scholarship and thouRhtfulne .. than just the one way 
of thinking advanced by the producers of "Hearts 
and Minds." 

The film tried also to suggest the North 
Vietnamese government sought only to advance 
Vietnamese solidarity, the national economy and 
peace among the people. The past five year., 
however, have seen a deteriorating economy in fhe 
South half of Vietnam, a continued economic plan 
based primarily on a wartime stance and a control of

1980 Olympics Open 
Amid Boycott Clouds 

LAKE PLACID NY - The Winter Olympics opened here 
under a cloud y~sterday with the International Olympic 
Committee rejecting President Carter's demand that the 
Summer Games be moved out of Moscow. But one American 
member of the IOC held out hope that US athletes might 
participate anyway. 

As the first competition of the Winter Games began, the US 
hockey team managed a 2-2 tie with Sweden thanks to a goal by 
defenseman Bill Baker with 27 seconds left. Canada, Norway 
and Romania also posted first ·round hockey victories. . 

Meanwhile, Lake Placid was beset by a comical 
transportation foulup that almost immobilized the town on the 
day before the opening ceremonies.. " 

After three days of discussions, IOC PreSident Lord Killarun 
announced that all 72 members attending the pre.Olymp~c 
meeting had agreed that the Summer Games should go on In 
Moscow as scheduled. The action was taken despite Carter':; 
threat to ask Ameri<;an Olympic officials not to ser,td a team If 
the Soviets refuse to pull their troops out of Afgharustan before 
next Wednesday. 

Douglas Roby, one of two American members of the IOC, 
said he thought American athletes would go to Moscow 
somehow unless the US government took some drastic 
measures such as canceling passports. USOC officials refused 
comment immediately. .

as saying resterday by a

said Iran's president should

The militants, meanwhile,

Nations, who said in Geneva, 
Switzerland that they were 
beginning to "lose credibility 
with the Iranian people" and 
had gone "beyond their task." 

Gromyko of the Soviet Union 
accused the United States 
yesterday of subverting

risks its independence by 
backing American and China

Pakistan will "undermine its 
position as an independent 
state" if it allows the United 
States and its allies to cOOvert 
it into "a springboard for 
further escalation of 
aggression" against pro-
Moscow Afghanistan, 
Gromyko said in a speech 
delivered at a banquet !{iven in 
his honor by India's Foreign 
Minister, P.V.N. Rao. 

Gromyko's strong words

Triton Swimmers Show Off In Tri-Meet 
Unexpectedly &.y Win Duer 
Diui.ion II Team Round. Weekend 

Br Jan lioeb 
The men', .wimming team 

didn't take anyone with them 
on their recent road trip to the 
Bay Area, but they had a 
cheering IeCtion at one of the 
meell. 

UCSD romped over Cal 
State Hayward 67·38 on 
Friday afternoon, then 
Saturday put on a show for 
parenll and friends of Triton 
.wimmers from the Bay Area, 
beating San Francisco State 
68·37 and Sacramento State 
73·30 in a tri·meet. 

The easy win over 
Hayward came as a surprise, 
as Hayward finished ) 8th in 
last year's NCAA Division II 

final., with limes in the 
neighborhood of those of the 
Tritons. All the .trength from 
that team wa. back this year 
aIao. 

"I thought they'd do better 
than they did," laid coach BiD 
Morgan. "But we swam 
exceptionally welL" 

Though the pool water was 
murky and several degrees 
warmer than ideal, some 
.wimmers had a good 
afternoon. Mark Allen, 
beginning what was to be an 
imprellive weekend, swam a 
2:05.5 200 backstroke, the 
best he'. ever done in a regular 
seaton meet. He also swam a 
2:03.7200 individual medley. 

Chri. Dixon made the 
national standard for the 200 
breut.troke in hi. 2:)8.) 
finish. Morsan expecll the 
school record to faD to Dixon 
within the next few meets. 

Steve Bt.1 milled 
qualifying for nationals in the 
200 Ay by a half aecond, but 
hell have two more chances at 
it in the next two weeks. 

The next morning the 
Tritons and Sacramento State 
travelled to San Francisco 
State for their tri-meet. 

The UCSD swimmers 
weren't generally swimming 
their best events. Instead they 
were competing in the races 
they seldom swim during the 
year. Still there were some big 
wins and fast times. 

The Triton 400 medley 
relay easily qualified for 
nationals, though only one 
swimmer of the four IS a 

regular on the top medley 
team. Mark Allen led off in the 
backstroke leg, and swam a 
57.6 , good enough for 
nationals. 

The rest of the team, Steve 
Best in the breut, Steve Seal 
in the fly, and John Beckley in 
the free, combined to put their 
time about a aecond under the 
national standard. 

Lance Halsted wasn"t 
scheduld to swim the 1000 
'ree that day, but he talked his 
coach into it. He saw that the 
pool record for the 1000 was

V -Ball Men Win 
Without Setter 

Rebounding from a defeat 
at the hands of the UCLA 
Bruins last Wednesday, the 
men's volleyball team won 
their league opener Friday 
night by easily defeating La 
Verne College, three games to 
one. 

Although they were swept 
in two strai.-Sht games by 
UCLA, the Tritons gave the 
defending NCAA champs a 
tough battle, losing the second 
game in overtime, 16·14. 

From there UCSD traveled 
to La Verne for their fourth 
road contest in a little more 
than a week. The victory there 
was particularly satisfying, not 
only being the Triton's first 
league match, but also their 
first victory without the 

servi~es of starting setter Steve 
Upp. 

Upp, a senior, is an A11-
Leaguer who is in his fourth 
year on the varsity squad. He 
sprained his left knee going up 
for a block at the recent Santa 
Barbara tournament and is 
still hobbling around on 
crutches. Triton Coach Doug 
Dannevik optimistically hopes 
for his retum in three weeks. 

But the Tritons' depth 
proved that even without Upp 
and with an uncharacteristic 
off night for Bob Rhodes, 
UCSD emerged victorious 
convincingly over La Verne. 

I he spikers' next home 
game is next Tuesday when 
they face the formidable 
University 01 Hawaii team.

independent variables. 

Both the FJ's and the Lasers 
are quick and have good 
acceleration. They are small 
(13 and 14 ft., respectively), 
and require c'oordinated 
teamwork between skipper 
and crew to sail, as wdl as 
precise timing and intense 
concentratior,. 

'Sweet N Sour' Has Dreams 
For 'Intellectual' Triton Cagers 

By Barbara Haas 
Senior Staff Writer 

In addition to backing up Ron Carter on the 
varsity basketball team Lem Lemons, 
assistant coach of the cagers, also acts as a 
confidant and moral supporter for the team. 

Lemons, who is referred to by the players as 
"Sweet 'N Sour," has been playing basketball 
for 34 of his 37 years. He attended college at 
Cal Western and played in their basketball 
program for four years under Bob 
K1oppenberg, last year's Triton coach. He still 
holds career rebounding and year scoring 
records. 

Although he won't admit that he was 
talented in college ball, he did say that he "was 
competitive. I liked to win." At this 
understatment he grinned widely and laughed, 
knowing very wdl he was downplaying that 
desire to win. 

In colJege he majored in counseling 
psychology, and is currently working toward a 
doctorate in marriage/family/child 
counseling. Now he's teaching psychology at 
City College. 

Between Cal Western and assisting at 
UCSD, Lemons had travded with the 
Globetrotters, taught at miscellaneous 
schools, and then finally settled in California in 
1961. 

He's been coaching since 1967, when he 
first started in Campo at a probation school. 
Then he progressed to a middle school before 
taking an assistant coaching job at San Diego 
High School. He stayed there seven years, 
and took over full contro. during his last year. 

After his stint at San Diego High, he stayed 
out of coaching for a few years, but became 
involved witFi a summer team. For four years 
he brought a . team up to Cal State L.A. to 
work in a program with lOme professionals . 
Then the opportunity arose for the coaching 
job at UCSD. 

Although originally contacted by 
K1oppenberg, Lemons was again asked by 
Carter to fill the position after Kloppenberg 
signed as a scout with the Sonics. 

Lemons enjoys working with the program. 
here. He said that "there's great potential 
here. I'd bke to start devdoping a team, a 
reputation. This type of school, which de-
emphasizes athletics, brings in the intdlectual 
players. And you always like to work with 
them on a basketball team." Again, he 
laughs 

He looks on this year as the foundation for a 
program with immeasurable potential. 

"Ten years down the road, I'm lookin~ for 
this school to be the UCLA of the VVest, ' he 
said, •

two characters, and it is Alain 
a tribute to the direction a. well 
as to the acton themselves 
that they are well-defined for 
the audience at the' outset, 10 
that the confUlion of the play 
doesn't ,,0 beyond what the 

script call. for. The production 
is superbly casted; throu,h 
co.tume and bodily affecta-
tions, the actors define their 
characters, who .eem to 
modern audiences little more 
than characer types, With 

I!!ecision and coherence . 
Thouth the play does have 
serioUi elements, they are Ie .. 
apparent than in other 
Shakespeare comedies. The 
best-performed ele~nts of 
this producti~n are the 

tomfoolery and knavery. Art 
Mendoza and Daniel Wirth 
work wiD together as the rakes 
Sir Toby Belch and Sir 
Andrew Aguecheek (their 
names . give adequate 
description of their predilec-
tions) and Malcolm Young 
gives a sterling if hyperblic 
treatment to the fatuous 
puritan Malvolio. 

Libby Dale, Ron Butts and Tom Mitchell in UCSD's "Twelfth Night." 

The main characters of the 
play, two pairs of lovers who 
are at firs t mismatched and 
deceived then happily united, 
a re very well presented . Libby 
Dale is particularly good as the 
ge ntlewoman Viola, who 
disguises herself as a eunich to 
gain access to the man she 
loves, Orsino: A s Orsino's 
servant, she plays messenger 
.to the narcissistic Olivia, 
played by Meredith Alex-
ander, who falls in love with 
her instead of her master. The 
lesbian-tinged aspects of this 
rapport come out clearly here , 
without being over-treated. AU 
the characters are in fact well· 
played, which means with 
~hakespeare that they 
manage to deliver his speeches 
clearly, without faltering or 
simply standing and reciting . 
woodenly. But one perfor-
mance stands out, namely that 
of Tom Mitchell as Feste, the 
fool and in many ways the 
epitome of Twelfth Night's 
spirit. He twists words and 
logic around for tuppence, 
confoUnding and delighting 
audience and cast alike with 
his extravagant mimicking. 
He allO sings several songs in 
the course of the play, and 
Mitchell's voice is a high point 
of th~ performance.

Christmas has arrived. He's 

a little late, becaUie of the fOl , 
but the minute he come. on 
stAle he spews forth ideas to 
his captivated stage hands and 
actors. 

He first shows the crew a 
few changes he would like to 
rehearse. Bending down on his 
knees, the small, spectacled 
director begins to map out 
stage directions on the floor. 
Then casting himself onto a 
chair he asks about ticket 
sales. He asks great friends 
and strangers alike "are you 
planning to see the show?" 

Eric Christmas, a Drama

a cquainted with Shakes-
speare'. plays. He has acted in 
many and has guest·directed

Merchant of Venice and 
TImons of Athens for the Old 
Globe Theatre. 

He also co-directed Twelfth 
Night in 1974 with Craig 
Noel , the art director of the 
Old Globe. Christmas said he 
has changed a few things from 
the last time he co-directed 
Twelfth Night , one being the 
time period during which the 
play takes place. 

" It · is around the 1830 
period in Western Europe or in 
the States. his a very romantic 
play. A little Byronic," said 
Christmas. 

He casts an aside to a crew 
member: "Go to the florist , 
they'll have that kind of paper. 
And a visiting card for Feste." 

Continuing: " It is . a 
romantic play and period , 
especially for the men. A time 
when people wrote romantic 

poetry. Does anybody know 
when Lord Byron lived?" 

Besides directing many of 
Shakespeare ' s plays, 
Christmas has allO acted in 
several. After graduating from 
the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Arts in London and 
working for the BBC, 
Christmas was a member of 
the Stratford Festival Theatre 
in Ontario ' from 1956 to 
1967, where he once played 
Malvolio in Twelfth Night. 

Christmas played the fool in 
the Old Globe production, but 
is not acting in this production 
of the comedy because he 
believes it is not very effective 
for the director to act in his 
own production. Christmas 
was able to act Feste in the Old 
Globe ~ersion , he says, 
because there Was a co-
director to take over. 

If you have not seen 
Christmas at UCSD it is most 
likely you have seen him in a 
feature length movie or a TV 
production. 

A memorable close-up of 
Christm81 is hi. part in the film 
Harold and Maude, starring 
Ruth Gordon. Christmas was 
the sickened priest who 
counsels young Harold about 
his proposal of marriage to 79-
year-old Maude. Christmas 
was allO in The Andromeda 
Strain and had made guest 
appearances on Bonanza, 
Streets of San Francisco and 
numerous othen. 'His most 
recent feature length movies 
were The Changeling and 
Middle Aged Crazy. 

Christmas became interes-
ted in directing Twelfth Night 
after using it in a second year 
Ifaduate section as a class 
assignment where he said he 
learned a great deal about it. 

"It is the most enjoyable of 
all of Shakespeare ' s 
comedies," said Christmas. " It
