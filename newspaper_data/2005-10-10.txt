UCSD receives grant 
for cancer research 
Funds are part of multiyear, 

$20 mil. nanotechnology plan 
By JESSICA HOllON 

Contri buting Writer 

Leaders from disparate fields 
of science will join forces with 
nanoparticles, which are invisible to 
the naked eye, to fight cancer under 
a new $3.9 million grant awarded 
to UCSD. The first phase in a five-
year, $20 million initiative funded 
by the National Cancer Institute, 
the grant will establish one of 
seven national Centers for Cancer 
Nanotechnology Excellence, at 
which researchers will work to har-
ness the particles' potential to seek 
and destroy cancerous cells without 
'harming hea lthy tissue. 

The project calls on biologists, 
chemists, engineers and physicians 
from UCSD's Moores Cancer 
Center, Burnham Institute for 
Medical Research and UC cam-
puses in Irvine, Santa Barbara and 
Riverside to collaborate on six proj-
ects that expand UCSD's existing 
platform in breast cancer and leu-
kemia research to explore a complex 
new field of noninvasive treatments. 

Their expertise will be pooled to 
engineer and test nanoscale devices 
- measured in billionths of a meter 
- that will be housed in porous 

micron-size devices C'd lled "moth-
er ships," as they travel through 
the body, signaling to researchers 
when cancerous tumors are detected 
and releasing treatments on-site to 
de troy hannful tissue. 

"There are drugs that people use 
today to treat cancer, but the drugs 
are very toxic and since you can't give 
tOO much drug to the patient, often 
those molecules will get degraded 
before it gets to where it is sup-
posed to go," said Michael Sailor, a 
UCSD professor of chemistry and 
biochemistry who will help lead the 
teams responsible for creating the 
transpon devices. "I f you can build 
an envelope around the molerute-
... they are protected until they get 
delivered on-site." 

Cancer treaonent is one of an 
array of new applications for nano-
technology, a field that has garnered 
national attention by utihing the 
behavior of groups of particles small 
enough to be affected by molecular 
forces. 

Togetherwith Burnham Institute, 
UCSD took a leading role in target-
ing rumors with nanoparticles in 
2002, when Burnham Institute pro-

Profs adjust to policy 
changes for eReserves 

By ERIKA CERVANlIS 
Contributing Writer 

Changes in policies for using 
electronic reserves resulting from 
last year's conflicts over copy-
right laws between the university 
and the Association of American 
Publishers have created inconve-
niences for university professors. 

In fall 2003, the MP sent a 
letter to UCSD concerning the 
operations of eReserves, a service 
used by professors to post copies 

of course readings through the 
campus libraries' Web si te. The 
letter stated that the program was 
going beyond the "fair use clause" 
of federal copyright law by pro-
viding free course materials online 
to students. 

Since then, the library sys-
tem has implemented significant 
changes to the eReserves service 
in response to the AAP's concerns, 
according to UCSD Libraries

I CURRENTS 
Group suggests 

doctoral changes 
As a part of a fIVe-year initia-

tive, the Woodrow Wilson National 
Fellowship Foundation published 
a report containing suggestions on 
improving educational- programs 
across the nation, 

The report, "The Responsive 
PhD.: Innovations in U.S. Doctoral 
Education: contains recommenda-
tions for universities, such as promot-
ing public scholarships that apply 
academic expertise to social chal-
lenges, broadening and reinvigorat-
ing efforts to open the doctorate to 
new populations, particularly from 
underrepresented minority groups, 
strengthening the authority and 
administrative capacity of graduate 
deans, fostering frequent dialogue 
among doctoral programs and Illu-
minating paths to altemative careers 
outside the research university. 

The study was compiled by a 
consortium of colleges, including 
UCLA and UC Irvine, and concluded 
that expressing concrete expectations 
about doctoral graduate programs to 
students once they begin pursuing 
their PhD. is integral to class reten-
tion. In addition, the report stated that 
universities have an urgent need to 
develop better mentoring services for 
their programs to increase diversity. 

The colleges also recommended 
goals for the near future, including 
emphasizing K-12 education in order 
to increase diversity, seeking new 
ways to apply academic knowledge 
to social challenges, promoting pub-
lic scholarship, strengthening doc-
toral education intemationally and 
improving professional development 
of doctoral students in a full range 
of careers. 

Public colleges see 
steep price hikes 

Between 200 1 {)2 and 2004-05, 
the costs of attending public four-year 
universities grew 22 percen~ accord-
ing to a U.s. Department of Education 
report released late last month. 

The annual data, issued by the 
departmenfs National Center for 
Educallon Statistics, also found that 
fees and tuition costs for in-state stu-
dents at those Institutions grew by 33 

percent The cost of tuition and fees 
at private four-year universities have 
not increased as sharply as public 
four-year universities, which currently 
average a total of $4,920. At private 
four-year for-profit profit college, the 
jump of tuitions and fees was only 22 
percent since 2001-02. All numbers 
were adjusted for inflation. 

lMlile the total cost of four-year 
public universities is still less expen-
sive than private four-year colleges, 
the inflation at public colleges has 
been larger. In 200 1 {)2, students 
who attended in-state public colleges 
paid an average total of $ 11,700 a 
year, while current students pay an 
average of $14,320, an increase of 
22 percent The total cost of atten-
dance at private four-year, for-profit 
colleges was $23,192 in 2001{)2, 
but currently stands at $27,852, a 20 
percent jump. 

The report also found that the 
amount of women who received 
degrees increased less than 1 per-
cent since last year while the rate of 
men receiving degrees stayed the 
same. 

FDA approves UCSD 
depression device 
Faculty at UCSD Medical Center 

have made another option for people 
affected by major depressive disor-
ders, according to a university press 
release. 

Psychiatrists and neurosurgeons 
at the center partnered in the effort 
to create an Implant that can treat 
patients who are resistant to typical 
depression treatments. 

The device, which expedites a 
process called vagus nerve stimula-
tion, was approved by the Food and 

Dru~ Administration In July for use 
as an adjunctive long-term treat-
ment for chronic or recurrent depres-
sion in patients 1 B years of age 
and older who are experiencing a 
major depressive episode that has 
not responded adequately to four 
or more antidepressant treatments,· 
according to the release. 

VNS is delivered thr ough the 
device, which is about two inches 
in diameter, when it is surgically 
implanted in the patienfs chest The 
apparatus then sends electrical sig-
nals through a nelVe in the neck to 
the brain.

A report released last month 
by the Educational Policy Instirute 
suggests that the United States is 
among the world's wom places to 
have student debt, particuIarly for 
students with low inCOme5_ 

The report, "Global Debt 
Patterns: An International 
Comparison of Student Loan 
Burdens and Repayment 
Conditions," examines the repay-
ment policies adopted by eight 
countries, including the United 
States and the United Kingdom. 

Low-income graduates in the 
U.S., defined as those who earn a 
third less than the average for those 
with a degree, can spend between 9 
and 15 percent of their income on 
debt repayments every month. By 
contrast, srudents earning at least 
a third above average can expect to 
hand over no more than 8 pereent, 
aa:ording to the report. 

A combination of three factors 
put American students at a disad-
vantage, according to srudy author 
and EPI Vice President Alex Usher. 
He first points to the high level of 
debt for American srudents, averag-
ing $19,300 each. 

"Interest rates are on the high 
side [and] most countries have 
some fornl of interest subsidy," 
Usher said. 

rn the United States, unlike 
most of Europe, a student's debt 
is subject to marLet f1ucruations in 
interest rates once they have com-
pleted their srudies. According to 
the report, graduates here currently 
pay 2.3 percent above this rate, 
while those still in college pay no 
inrerest at all, if they are qualified 
for a subsidized loan. 

UNIVERSITY CENTERS 

Usher suggested that the dif-
fering rates before and after gradu-
ation work to the advantage of 
wealthier graduates. 

"Most countries don't make that 
distinction between in-study and 
out-of-study," he said. "The U.S.-
Canadian system works well for 
students who payoff their debt 
quickly." 

Yet another conoibuting f.lctor 
to worse student debt in America 
is a lower level in which debt has 
to be repaid, Usher said. The 
income threshold for repayment 
lies between 58,000 and $11,000, 
according to the report. This is 
likely the crucial flaw, Usher said, 
forcing srudents to make repay-
ments on their loans before they can 
afford to. Other counoies exam-
ined in the study allow srudents 
significantly more financial leeway; 
in Gennany, repayments begin 
at a salary equivalent to around 
$14,000, and British students are 
exempt from repayments until they 
are earning about 526,400. 

The study is by no means criti-
cal of the U.S. system, which offers 
unrivaled flexibility with an array 
of different government programs, 
Usher said. 

"In any other counoy, you don 't 
have the option of messing with the 
repayment perioel, n he said. "This 
affords U.S. srudents a great deal of 
choice in how they repay, whereas 
other countries impose fixed repay-
ment periods. 

lndeed, the report contests the 
notion that the level of debt itself is 
the main cause of srudent hardship, 
and argues that "simply measur-
ing student debt is a completely 
inadequate way of looleing at the 
consequences of student debt." 

The report cites the example 

of Sweden, where students take on 
large debts but contribute a rela-
tively modest proportion of their 
income toward servicing them. 
It concludes that "even very high 
amounts of debt can be easily sus-
tlIined given generous interest rate 
and repayment policies." 

-fbese policies are often referred 
to as "income-contingent repay-
ment. n The United States offers 
both ICR and non-ICR options to 
srudems. 

This January, EPI released a 
paper defending ICR and advo-
cated examining individual policies 
on a case-by-ase basis to avoid the 
"negative connotations that ICR 
has accumulated over the years." 

The instirute has drawn criti-
cism in the past from the Canadian 
Srudent Federation, which argues 
that EPI's research has a political 
agenda, supporting moves within 
Canada to increase the level of sru-
dent tuition. The report includes 
unflattering findings on the effect 
of U.S. tudent finance policy on 
low-paid graduates. 

The CSF responded with a 
report charging the instirute with 
seeking to "consolidate and narural-
ize a social world of ever-increasing 
debt and a market regime of ruition 
fees." 

Usher still maintains that his 
organization's work is not of politi-
cal nature, and will not have a major 
effect on government policy. 

"There's not a lot of recom-
mendations," he said. "We tend 
to be very analytical and descrip-
tive. I don't sense that there's a 
huge amount of interest within the 
U.S."

1:e Facebook hit the college scene in 2004, spreading like wild6re as it caught on at 
schools all across the nation. Students 
can 6nd people in their classes, "poke" 
frienc!s, upload their pictures, and let 
everyone know that they are looking 
for a serious relationship, or perhaps 
only "random play." 

The Facebook is popular because 
it's such great fun. \\'ho doesn't want 
to see a picture of your half-naked 
classmate chugging Jack Daniels out 
of a vase at Friday's frat party? But 
officiaJs at UC Santa Barbara recently 
put a damper on the debauchery by 
announcing that what ~1Udents post on 
Facebook and other similar sites can be 
used as sufficient evidence to take dis-
ciplinary action or start administrative 
investigations into the "ClUJ." 

Naturally, students are outraged. 
The Facebook is supposed to be a 
place where college kids can be them-
selves and let it all out! What about 
freedom of expression and privacy 
rights? Students should be allowed ro 
post whatever tiley want on their Web 
pages without anyone shaking a finger 
at them, right? Well, of course they 
should be allowed to post whatever 
they want. After 311, this is America, 
isn't it? But as for the "without anyone 
shaking a fiDger at them" pan ... well, 
thar's a different story . 

This isn't a free speech issue; it's 
about students voluntarily providing 
school administrators with evidence of 
iIIeg31 bebavior. If someone posts pic-
tures of himself on Facebook drinking 
or engaging in other illegal activities, 
why is he complaining about privacy 
rights in the first place? He pur it there 
for people to see. Facebook's spokes-
man said that the site "is a public 
forum." If you want to keep your 
drinking bouts a secret, posting pic-
tures of them on public Web sites is 
not a prudent course of action.

handbook at UCSB, "parties with 
alcohol are prohibited in the residence 
hall community." The same is true at 
UCSD and many other universities 
across the nation. School officials can 
search a student's room if they have 
reason to believe (in other words, if 
they get some son of tip-off) that the 
student is in possession of illegal sub-
stances. Adminisuators have realized 
that Facebook postings can constitute 
a legitimate tip-off as well - isn't an 
online photo of someone drinking 
&om a bottle of Corona while stand-
ing in &ont of Such-and-such Hall 
pretty reasonable evidence? It seems 

" Carelessly providing proof 
that you break me rules 

is risky in itself, especially 
at a school where an mar 

can cost you your 
d . " eucat:ron. 

better than anybody's testimony would 
be. 

As for free speech, it has its JUnits. 
You can't yell "Fire!" in a crowded the-
ater. Consider posting a photo of your-
self chugging Grey Goose on Facebook 
the equivalent of yelling -Fire!" The 
consequences will be serious, even if the 
act seems hannless in itself. Students 
are still free to joke about it in a more 
personal, private setting. 

F acebook isn't the only culprit in this 
case. Students have found themselves in 
hot water for other things they've post-
ed in other public forums and blogs. 
Your twisted fantasies and bitter tirades 
might not be concrete proof of any 
wrongdoing, but school administra -

tors hive teamed over the yean to 
take these things seriously, just in case. 
Earlier this year, after 'receiving com-
plaints about racist Facebook gtVUpS 
and teacher-stalking, administnton at 
the University of Mississippi ruled that 
students can be disciplined for evidence 
of sulking, harassing or making dis-
criminatory comments about someone 
on Facebook. Another student at the 
Univenity of New Hampshire was sus-
pended from classes for a description in 
a blog of how he envisioned gunning 
down fellow students and rapiDg a 
female activist he "hated." 

Students should be investigated for 
things they say and post online, even 
if they're "not serious," because some-
times it's a serious mistake to just let 
them go. It is the job of school officials 
to ensure that rules are being followed 
and that all readily occurring pursuits 
of life and liberty are acceptable to the 
genenl school body. Announcing that 
you want to rape somebody because 
she's a feminist activist is unacceptable. 
So is posting pictures of yourself smok-
ing a joint on Faceboolc. 

Carelessly providing proof that you 
break the rules is risky in itself, espe-
cially at a school where an error can 
cost you your education. Many students 
don't realize that professors and poten-
tial employers abo look at Facebook 
when making decisions about whether 
or not they want someone worlring 
for them - yet another reason why 
being carelels on Facebook is a h. 
mistake. 

Students at UCSD are sman. 
That's why they got accepted to this 
school in the first place. But they can 
make stupid decisions, especially when 
it comes to the Internet. Thi~ news 
should be a wake-up call to students: 
If someone is dumb enough to post 
incriminating evidence on public Web 
sites, then he or she deserves whatever 
the sch(>Ol administration sends his or 
her way.

'Council squanders resolutions ~ ILEnERs TO THE EDITOR 
Hats 
off @ 

Vladimir Kogan 

P ick any powerless o r oth -erwise disadva n ta ged subgroup: for example, 
,I threatened species of three-
legged, cross-eyed ,ambian 
plar)lJUScS. Face thcm off aga inst 
an authoritative, wealthy oppo-
nent - especially a pro~lt-seek ­
i ng multination<l I corpora rion or 
an impersonal public research 

i n~titUlion . Add a teaspoon of 
Ide,distic, trec-hugging, wea lth-
distributing tudellts. Voila.' r\ 
perfecl recipe for a lIleaningles~ 
A.S. Council resolution. 

It happens every y~"r. An 
enterprising cou nci lmember 
writes a passionate . but usually 
misinformed declaration about 
an e oteric global issue, and then 
convinces UCSD's student gov-
ernment to put the endorsement 
of the entire student body behind 
it . .In most cases, th e council goes 
along, though few memhers have 
adequate knowledge of the issue 
at hand or the necessary back-
ground to make an intelligent 
decision. 

In my hypothetical case, it 
could be that - unbeknownst 
to the A.S. Counci l - protect-
ing the Gambian platypuses 
from poaching may deprive a 
nearby village of poor, orphaned 
amputees of their main economic 
staple. Knowing this, would the 
council still be better off passing 
a resolution condemning the kill-
ing of platypuses? 

T hough less absurd, some-
thing similar will happen this 
week, when the A.S. Council tries 

ro meddle in an ongoing labor 
dispute hetween the niversity 
of California and olle of its 
unions. In a proposed resolution 
submitted by Vice President of 
Academic Affairs I larry Khanna, 
the council demands - purport-
edly on behalf of CSD under-
graduates - that as much as 
75 percent of uniforms worn by 
ce rtain university employees be 
imported from IIl1ionhrd sweat-
~hops. 

Since foreign policy 'lI1e1 trade 
liberalization issuc; were ne"er 
discussed in last year's A.S. elec-
rion, one may wonder how cur-
renr council members can claim 
witb certainty that s tudent~ want 
r percent 'of uniforms to be 
made by unionized labor. Could 
students perhaps want only 70 
percent to be manufactured by 
unionized workers? Or maybe 
even 80 percent? Nor is it clear 
how srudent government leaders 
possess enough knowledge about 
the geopolitical narure of uni-
form manufacturing to know the 
socially optima l number. 

evertheless, given its uack 
record, the council will likely 
pass the resolution, perhaps even 
unanimously . 

Of course, if resolutions were 
known to be meaningless and 
fluffy symbolic gestures, they 
would be stripped of all impor-
tance. 

lt gets more serious when 
they commit the student body to 
policies that may actually leave 
society worse off. 

A case in point is the San Diego 
living-wage issue of 2002 : At the 
time, San Diego's City Council 
began considering imposing 
a "living wage" - a minimum 
hourly salary much higher than 
the state's mjnimum wage - for 
all contractors who do business 

with the city. The A.S. Council 
jumped into the fray, unani-
mously passing a resolution that 
backed the living wage proposal, 
stating, "ASUCSD believes that 
our tax dollars should not create 
or subsidize poverty jobs, and 
that quality economic develop-
ment means quality job develop-
rncnt." 

The city has, since then, 
passed the living wage proposal. 

This summer. the nonpar-
tis~lI1 Public Policv In~tirutc of 
California re le:l~ed ' a ~tudv look-
ing at the effects of simdu'r legis-
lation in Ill,ln\, citic~ ;Hound the 
country. And the think-t;l nk con-
cluded that :l living wage could 
help stop the ~ubsidy of "poverrv 
jobs" - not by raising wages but 
by simply e liminating the posi-
tions. 

Economists have long argued , 
and the study confirmed, that 
wage floors generally act like a 
tax on unskilled labor. For some 
low-skilled and low-paid work-
ers, these restrictions rai e wages. 
But for the lowest skilled and 
the lowest paid, minimum wages 
actually make their positions pro-
hibitively expensive, leading to 
their elimination. 

While San Diego was not 
included in the PPIC study, we 
can expect a similar outcome: 
Some poor families will see their 
pay rise slightly, while the poor-
est will likely become unem-
ployed and thus worse off than 
they were before the living- wage 
implementation. 

The debate over whether its 
better to sacrifice the welfare of 
some if it makes others better off 
is a philosophical one, but it's a 
debate that the A.S. Coun cil never 
had. Instead, uninformed coun-

Faculty: Task force to make campus inquiry 
continued fram page I 

minee wiu address topics through a 
variety of methods, including listen-
ing to faculty members' opinions 
and suggestions. 

"rrhe) ue understands that in 
order to fulfill its mission as a stew-
ard of one of the most diverse states 
in the union, it must make sure its 
faculty can meet the educational 
needs of an increasingly diverse 
student body," UC Office of the 
President spokeswoman Jennifer 
Ward said. 

Dynes said that in order to 
remain competitive, ue campuses 
must recruit and retain underrepre-
sented minority and female faculty 
members. 

"Over the last two decades, UC 
has made measurable progress to 
improve diversity in its ladder-tanK 
faculty," the taSK force Web site 
quotes Dynes as saying. "However, 
there is much more worK to be 
done." 

According to Ward, over the 

Choese the 
lEST 
.fsan Diego 

next five to 10 years, up to one-third 
of current UC faculty members will 
reach retirement age. She said that 
the task force's work is "crucial, 
opportune and timely," because "the 
UC will have the opportunity to 
recruit and hire an unprecedented 
number of f2culty." 

The task force has no authority 
to create or enforce any policy deci-
sions for the university, according to 
Ward, and will in no way interfere 
with Proposition 209. The voter-
approved initiative, passed in ) 996, 
outlaws preferential treattnent on 
the basis of race, SCI, color, ethnic-
ity or national origin by government 
agencies. 

"They are just loolc.ing at who 
makes up our f2cu1ty," Ward said. 
"From whatever way you are look-
ing at it, no one is talling about 
affinnative action." 

Although, in recent years, the 
university has shown an upward 
trend in faculty diversity, only 
approximately 20 percent of current 

full-time faculty members - includ-
ing associate and assistant professors 
- are minorities. Similarly, women 
maKe up approximately 24 percent 
of university f2culty, according to 
2001-02 ueop statistics. 

The task force will present a 
preliminary report to UC chancel-
lors at the completion of its work, 
expected in early 2006. Dynes will 
then convene a systemwide sum-
mit looking at issues raised by the 
repon. 

"It's the lc.ind of challenge that 
wiU require multiple approaches," 
Becerra said in a UCLA press 
release. "It's not a top-down thing 
- leadership can't do it alone, and 
f2cu1ty can't do it alone. It has to be 
seen by everyone as a goal worth 
achieving. " 

Becerra and other TaSK Foree 
members will visit UeSD Nov. 15 
and 16.

8 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONMV, OCTOBER 10, 2005 

Reserves: New policies include closer reviews of course,reading usage 
continued from page I 

Legal Adviser Julie Conner. The 
changes include educating frondine 
staff on fuir-use issues and requir-
ing professors to read a statement 
affirming that they understand the 
law before posting materials. 

A cap on the number of times 
that course readings ca.n be used 
was another policy change, Conner 
said. If a professor POSts a course 
reading in more than one ternl, the 
library must ask permission for its 
reuse and pay a fee that comes from 
the libraries' budget, she said. 

The policies have been a change 
of pace for some professors, who 
feel dlat the strict rules have trans-
formed a once expcdiem service 
into a more difficult one. 

"There is a lot more red tape," 
political science professor Samuel 
Popkin said. "Instead of just ask-
ing for a previous excerpt to be put 
back up, you submit a full request 
so it can be · checked against past 
usc." 

Changes to the policies have 
set back the amount of time the 

library takes to process an eReserves 
request, according to assistant com-
munications professor Nitin Govil. 

"It does seem that eReserves 
is very stringent about complying 
with fair-use criteria, in particular 
verifying the percentage of a copy-
righted work being put on reserve,' 
he said. "This can, and does, create 
delays and unpredictability about 
exacdy when a request will be pro-
cessed." 

Conner attributed the delays to 
the course overload in the begin-
ning of the quarter, rather than 
procedural changes. 

"Sometimes faculty feel things 
aren't happening fast enough, 
because the front line is so flooded 
with requests the week before class-
es start," Conner said. 

Some fuculty members are find -
ing that they have to rework course 
materials or find different ways to 
get readings to students because 
they cannot post the same pieces in 
more than one term. 

"In one case I could replace the 
book with articles the author pub-

lished first," Popkin said. "In other 
cases, I will fuce a real dilemma next 
year. Fortunately the librarians are 
really helpful." 

Not only has use of course mate-

rial been limited by the new rules, 
but also me time in which eRe-
serves can approve those materials, 
according to School of International 
Rela tions and Pacific Studies asso-
ciate professor Roger Bohn. 

"It certainly has cut down on our 
ability to use material, and on our 

ability to put material up quickly," 
he said. "The old eReserves system 
was wonderful and ultra-conve-
nient. [It is) no longer." 

Before the policy change, the 
AAP and the university tried to 
come to terms, according to UC 
Counsel Mary E. MacDonald. 
However, those discussions led me 
AAP to contemplate legal action, 
she said. AAP Vice President for 
Legal and Government Affairs 
Allan Adler denied any implication 
that me organization was close to 
any lawsuits, but declined to com-
ment further. 

A1mough a lawsuit may not have 
been explicidy threatened, it was 
suggested, Conner said. 

"They essentially said, 'We're 
prepared to bring legal action,'" 
Conner said. "They were not shy 
about it." 

Even if me suit was filed, it 
would have been unsuccessful for 
the AAP, according to MacDonald. 

"We told [the AAP) that even 
if they sued us, they couldn't get 
damages," she said. "[It is) because 

we are protected by .. . sovereign 
immunity to public entities, and 
we're not liable for intellectual 
properties. " 

The UCSD library system noti-
fied the association of its changes, 
but the organil.3tion was still dissat-
isfied, and proceeded to contact the 
UC Office of me President general 
counsel, feeling the problem went 
beyond UCSD and included the 
rest of the UC campuses, according 
to MacDonald. In meeting with 
AAP last fall and early this year, 
the university maintained its posi-
tion that eReserves and similar pro-
grams were within legal bounds, 
MacDonald said. 

"We explained why, in our opin-
ion, there was not a violation of fair 
use," she said. "This is actually a 
national issue; it's not just a UCSD 
issue. AAP is concerned wim prac-
tices nationwide at universities, and 
concerned about potential loss of 
income for meir publishers."

MONDAY. OCTOBER 10. 2005 1 HE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Health: Students satisfied with counseling results 
continued from page I 

point," she said. "We are doing so 
many mings right now to help crve 
students' nceds, but someming like 
psychology is often overlooked. 
Addressing mental health at a UC 
level is exactly what students and 
faculty need." 

UCSD psychological services 
has a larger budget than some UC 
campuses, according to Juarez. 

The financial base, which is used 
largely for staff salaries, lags behind 
similar counseling programs at UC 
Berkeley, UC Davis and UCLA but 
ranks above UC Irvine, UC Santa 
Barbara, UC Santa Cruz and UC 
Riverside. 

A budget that could notmeetSan 
Diego's high cost of living forced 
many UCSD psychologists to leave 
thc program last year, Juarez said. 

"San Diego became very pricey, 
which our salaries could not keep 
up with ," she s~id. "'A'e lost seven 
of our staff last year, and about 
four of dlem left I~ecallsc of sa lary 
reasons." 

Although the program W:IS able 
to serve approximately 2,000 snl-
dent, last vear, this shonage of staff 
mcmbcrs . led to anothe; chaotic 
start mis yea r, juarez said. 

" It was very bad last year," ~he 
sa id . "During the first quarter, there 
was a big amount of appoi ntment 
losses, with students not wanti ng 
to wait that lo ng for appointments, 
or canceling because they had sec-
ond moughts. We had a wai dist 
duce weeks full with 100 students, 
because we wamed everyone who 
signed up to be screened at least 
once." 

The IcngdlY wait time, espe-
cially for a first session, was an 
e pecially difficult period , accord-
ing to Revelle College sophomore 
Tracy Ho, who used the on-campus 
program three times. 

"It usually took twO to mree 
weeks to get an appointment," she 
said. "For the first time, it gets 
jammed because a lot of the space 
is reserved for students who are 
already established mere. It would 
have been better if appointments 
had been more readily available. 
You eventually get your slot, but 
thcre's the negative stigma of mera-
py mat can make you redlink before 
your appoinonent if you want to go 
or not." 

110 said she attended on-ca m-
pus essions before her cou n-
selor suggested more long-term 
care at UCSD Medical Center in 
1-1 i Ikrest. 

"The fact that he let me know 
my options and referred me else-
where was probably the ming I 
appreciated most," Ho said of her 
psychologist. "My personal prob-
Icms needed to be dealt with on 
a longer and more regular basis 
and mey didn't have thc capacity 

Students who apeed or stronafy ..-cI thet counseling helped them

and resources to deal with that on 
campus." 

The service was still convenient, 
since me shuttle went straight to 
the center, and me merapy was 
co\'ered hv student health insur-
ance, I [0 s~ id . 

CSD counseli ng services are 
mcant for short-term care, Juarez 
said, with patients using services 
three to five times on average. The 
program has a 12-session limit, 
which may be waived under special 
circumsta nces, sbe said. 

T hose who do use the se rvices, 

" College made 
every thing a lot harder. 

It's a change in the 
environment itself. Yau 
have UJ deal with new 
ideas, a whole different 

set of people. II 
- Tracy Ho, soPhomore, 

Revelle cOllege 
however, are generally pleased wim 
its results, according to the lat-
est Counseling Experiences Survey, 
administered in 2003 -04. 

In me survey, all 202 students 
either "strongly agreed" or "agreed" 
dlat dlC counseling program was a 
"valuable student service." 

Ilowever, so me students 
expressed dissati sfaction with me 
amount of acce s, with comments 
calli ng fo r "more psychiatrists, 
pleasc" and other stating that "more 
sessions should he offered." 

110 echoed dle sentiment, and 
sa id that a subject as dclicate as 
mental hea lth should receive more 
attention . 

" It 's so important to have more 
people on staff," she said. "The 
most important thing for people 
who need therapy is to be in mera-

pyas soon as possible. [ know a lot 
of schools don't have psychologists 
mainly because of funding, but mey 
should all be preparcd." 

ollege life is e\'en more reason 
to focus on mental healm, 110 said. 

"College made everything a lot 
harder," she said of her own experi-
ence. "It's a change in the environ-
ment itself. You have to dcal with 
new ideas, a whole different sct of 
people. IEvenJ people who don't 
have problems find dle change dif-

~1cult. " 
F.ven with a full staff, which 

includes 12 senior cl inical ~taff 
members, mree postdoctoral fel-
lows and five psychologiC'.!1 interns, 
the services could always expand , 
according to juarez. The program 
will require at least one or twO 
more psycholobriSts to fill me goa l 
of having one psychologist for every 
1,500 students, juarez sa id. 

Currently, UCSD offers sev-
eral other mcntal healm services, 
including last week's Depression 
Screening Day mat served a record 
I 72 studen ts. 

Thirty-three of the students 
screened scored positive for depres-
sion while 13 were found to have 
ymproms indicative of bipolar dis-

order, according to campus psy-
chologist Tiffany O 'Meara . The 
campus also will hold an "Out ofmc 
Darkne s" fundrai cr in October 
to raise resea rch funds for student 
mental hea lth . 

T he importance of halancing 
between social, academic anti fam-
ily life has placed the need on the 
University of California to ensure 
mcntal hea lth programs can ade-
quately serve students, POOrSiJ13 
sa id . 

"r n general, all universitie arc 
grappling with the changing needs 
of our sUldems for mcntal health 
and counseling services," she sa id . 
"This is an issue of national impor-
tance. It is important not o nly to 
the individual campuses, but to the 
UC system as a whole. "

Cancer: Program to pioneer new research 
continued fram page I 

fessor Erklci Ruoslahti worked wim 
Sailor and bioengineering associ-
ate professor Sangeeta Bhatia to 
achieve the first targeted delivery 
of a nanodevice into the cancerous 
tissues of a living organism. 

While grants and private dona-
tions have enabled mc university 
to spend more man $150 million a 
year on cancer research , primarily 
through me 26-year-old, 280-f.1cul-
ty-member Moores Cancer Center, 
researchers involver! in the nanotech 
project argue that me new center 
will be invaluable in bringing nano-
technology to me realm of cancer 
trcatment. 

"This will be an engineering 
cemer with a different culture, and 
a strong emphasis on new tech-
nology and its applications," said 
Sadik Escner, UCSD professor of 
electrical and computer engineering 
and a principal investigator for the 
new center. "It will be a resource 
to bring researchers from differ-
em disciplines togemer regardless 
of their respective field, depamnent 

or campus." 
Researchers involved in the proj-

ect also say that the networking and 
infrastructure provided by the new 
grant is necessary to test the safe-
ty of nanostructures against meir 
potentially dangerous side effects. 

"We need to dcvelop interac-

" This wiU be an 
engineering center with

tions which can educate the engi-
neer as to what dle biological chal-
lenges are, and the biologist as to 
what me capacities for me engineer-
ing are," Moores Cancer Center 
Deputy Director Thomas Kipps 
said. "We will be going back and 

forth ... to tcst nanostructures and 
their toxicity, how well they work in 
animal models, how well mey fight 
tumors." 

According to Kipps, collabo-
ration mat will occur under the 
new initiative should also have a 
profound effect on cducation at 
UCSD by allowing students access 
to numerous disciplines in a field of 
research that is likely to be a grow-
ing industry in the future. 

"rUndergraduates] will see a bet-
ter integration between all me dif-
ferent courses they have to take 
and arc going to bc able to much 
better adapt," Kipps said. "They will 
serve an important role in cata lyz-
ing interactions from the merger of 
various disciplines." 

The new center will find a home 
on the fifth floor of the recently 
completed Moores Cancer Center 
building and will make use of labs 
scattered across UCSD and other 
participating campu cs.

NIGHT DRAWS NEAR: 
IRAQ'S PEOPLE IN THE 

SHADOW OF AMERICA'S WAR 
By ANTHONY SHADID 

8y VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

As Iraqis go to the polls this week to vote on a new if imperfect constitu-tion, Americans ponder at which 
point the "liberation" went so terribly 
wrong. If there is one thing Pulitzer Prize-
winning Washington Post reporter Anthony 
Shadid makes clear, it's that the answer is a 
complex one, requiring a deep understand-
ing ofIraq's conflicted history. 

[n his new book, "Night Draws Near: 
Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's 
War,' the Oklahoma-born Lebanese 
American recounts his days in Baghdad as 
an embedded reporter of a different kind, 
teUing the stories of regular Iraqis from 
several weeks before the invasion through 
the insurgency that continues to lut long 

after. 
"Even if, against the odds, Iraqis man-

age to avert worse violence, history will 
sti ll condemn America for its blunder-
ing in their country," the hawkish and 
ardently pro-war Economist magazine 
wrote in a September review of Shadid's 
book.. "Mr. Shadid lists the mistakes dis-
passionately, including th ose well known 
- the insufficient number of occupying 
troops, the disbanding of Iraq 's security 
forces - and those less advertised, that the 
Sadrist uprising began after an American 
helicopter rammed a sacred Shia flag for 
fun, or that the resistance in FaUujah began

Despite risks, some 
students tum to Adderall to 
stay on the academic track 

By KATIE WESTFALL

ith modern life characterized by speed 
and productivity, schedules are tight and 
agenoas are full. Our minds are constantly 
being called upon to complete task after 
task: to evaluate, analyze, recall, process, 
organize and create. Multitasking is not 

an option, but rather a necessity in this daily grind. 
With so many thoughts pirouetting through the 
brain, it can be difficult to focus on the job at hand, 
its stresses both physically and mentally exhausting. 

This is why some turn to Adderall. 
Adderall is a common prescription for those with attention 

deficit hyperactivity disorder, helping to lengthen attention 
pans and increase the ability to conccnrrate. In recent years, 

however, college students who deal with the slings and arrows 
of midterms, finals and exams like the LSAT and MCAT h,l\'c 
been using Adderall a a study aid becau e of the drug's stimu-
lative properties, which can keep the user awake and focused 
for long periods of time. 

There have been no studies at UCSD about the use of 
Addera ll by students without a prescription, and use is prob-
ably not widespread. But some students say it helps them get 
by. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Mark Kaufman sees 
. wrong with the occasional use of Adderall to help 

the level of concenrration and energy required for a 
schedule. 

summertime, r didn't take AdderaJI once, because 
't the need to," Kaufman said. "Bur now that school 

started, you've got work, school and other various hobbies 
are important to you. AdderaU for academic purpose, 

is good, but not in the way that some people take 

The pill seems a perfect answer to the busy individual's 
- an easy way to gain that exrra energy, motivation and 

But is using the drug just a hannless way to pull an all-
nighter? 

According to Panit Pollavith, a drug information specialty 
phannacy resident at UCSD Medical Center, Addera ll is a 
highly addictive substance, "classified as a Schedule 2 drug, a 
classification given to a drug wi th fa high) abuse potential and 
dependence profile." 

Possession of a Schedule 2 drug without a prescription is

'Adderall: User recounts how stimulant use led to plummeting grades 
continued fram page I I 

iUegal . Other drugs in this catego-
ry include cocaine, morphine and 
some opiates. 

Adderall, a central nervous sys· 
tem stimulant, is composed of four 
amphetamine salts: amphetamine 
aspartate, amphetamine sulfate, 
dextroamphetamine saccharate and 
dextroamphetamine sulfate. 

What began as recreational 
use evenruaJly became a study aid 
and ended in addiction for one 
Roosevelt senior, who preferred to 
remain anonymous. 

"Basically you're hooked when 
you stan trying it," he said. "You 
make excuses to take it. You lie to 
yourself, like a cigarette smoker; 
' I'm drinking some coffee; I need to 
have a cigarette. I have to read this 
book, I'll take some Adderall. '" 

T he physical effects of abuse are 
characterized by fatigue, repeated 
health complaints, red and glazed 
eyes and lasting cough, according 
to Pollavith. 

"It killed me," the anonymous 
ERC student said. "I lost so much 
weight. You don't eat at all ." 

In addition to phys i(:a l deteriora-
tion, the effects of menta l change 
are also apparent. Emotional want-
ing signs of abuse arc sudden mood 
changes, irritalJiliry, irresponsible 
behavior, low self-esteem, poor 
judgment, depression and gcnera l 
lack of intere t, Pollavith said. 

"The externalities were the 
effects on my social life," the srudelll 

said. "Pd become more antisocial. [ 
St:lrted avoiding friends. [ wanted to 
st:ly inside more. 1 kept to myself. 
I thought that I was on a different 
level than everyone else." 

According to this student, its fre-
quent availability added to constant 
use. He noted that one can easily 
find someone with a prescription to 
AdderaU who is willing to sell it or 
even just give it away. 

"I knew a person who was pre-
scribed Adderall and didn't take it," 
he said. "H e would just give it away, 
hand it to me. That was the worst 
way ro be introduced to it ... to be 
given an unlimited supply of it." 

However, he noted that the 
demand for the drug during rnid-
temlS and finals exceeded its supply 
when it became more popular dur-
ing the last school year. 

Although he took AdderaJJ to 
help academic performance, the 
exact opposite resulted instead. He 
F.iiled a math class twice because he 
did not go to class or study, think-
ing that cramming the night before 
on Adderall would be successful. 
He said it "gives you a F.ilse sense 
of invincibility when it comes to the 
academic lifestyle." 

Since then, however, he has 
stopped using Adderall. La t quar-
ter he received a 4.0 GPA without 
d1e drug - a sign ificant improve-
ment from his "8" average CPA 
twO quarters be fore. 

"1 find that I think better ,1Ild 
clearer when I'm not on t113t," he 

said. "My grades proved that to me. 
That was aU r needed to see. 1 don't 
want to have to rely on drugs to 
make me a reliable person." 

Although this is the experience 
of a srudent with normal function-
ing abilities, Adderall can be incred-
ibly beneficial to those with actual 
attention focusing disorders. 

Among other stimulants and 
treatments, the drug is used to treat 

" I was asking myself, lAm 
I taking this because I 

need Adderall to focus ar 
am I just taking it because 

it's two in the morning 
and I'm tired as hell ... '" 

people diagnosed with ADHO. The 
disorder is characterized by impul -
sivity, inattention and sometimes 
hyperactivi ty. It is almost always 
a childhood-onset disorder, and 
it affects about 3 to 9 percent of 
school-age children and 4 percen l 
of adul ts worldwide. bout one-
third of the people with the disorder 
will outgrow it in adulthood. 

If untreated, however, marita l, 

work and driving problems may 
ensue, according to Paul Lee, a psy-
chiatrist at UCSO's Psychological 
and CounseLing Services. 

AdderaU is comparable to meth-
ylphenidate, the active ingredient in 
popular ADHO drugs Ritalin and 
Concerta. Adderall has been proven 
to last longer and have less severe 
side effects and withdrawal effects , 
according to Pollavith. 

John Muir College senior Jason 
Yeatman is prescribed Adderall for 
a minor case of AOHD. lie has 
stopped taking the medication com-
pletely over the past year becausc 
he finds it unnecessary and over-
prescribed, simply given out to fix 
problems, such as bad srudy habits, 
mat could be solved without medi-
cation. 

"There's such a thin line," 
Yeatman said . "I was asking myself, 
'Am I taking this because r need 
AdderaU to focus, or amI just taking 
it because it's two in the morning 
and I'm tired as hell and 1 wam to 
stay up all night? '" 

He also believes it enhances 
everyone's focusing performance, 
whether someone has a light atten-
tion problem or not. For this rea-
son, he believes that it provides 
an unfair advantage in aC'Jdemics 
when taken by students with nonnal 
attention abilities. 

"Addcra ll in college is like StC-
roids in sports," Yeatman said. 

Yeatman overcamc his 1)110 
by learning and coping with thc way 

his brain works, like figuring out the 
best type of environment for study-
ing. He found a successful alterna-
tive to medication in dealing with 
his less severe attention problems. 

"Stimulants can really help peo-
ple who have ro do something that 
is just not inherently interesting for 
them or whose level of dysfunction 
is really high ," sa id Jerry Phelps, a 
clinical psychologist at Psychological 
and Counseling Services. 

Medication is the first line of 
treatment and often successful. 
SOllle Illay requi re other treatments, 
such as behavioral therapy, orga-
nizational , study and social- skills 
training, as well as therapy to help 
improve self-esteem as accompani-
ments for th e medication. 

T hose with minor attention and 
fidgeting problems may be able to 
overcome them with si mple no-
medication treatments, Lee said.

Water polo: Tritons gear up for trip north 
continued from page 20 

added yet another point to the 
scoreboard at the opening of the 
third quarter, followed by a des-
perate follow-up goal by Stover 
to bring the score to 7-3. 

Junior Ty Lackey and senior 
Jonathan Hopkins then carried 
UCSD to a confident 9-3 lead 
with twO more goals in the third 
quarter. 

The Tigers scratched their 
way back to a 9-5 deficit before 
Hopkins netted his second goal 
of the third quarter to give the 
Tritons five-goal lead. 

The game ended much like 
it began, with two goals from 
both teams in the final quarter. 
UCSD used its most dangerous 
weapons, Borso and Hopkins, to 
do the final damage. 

"Our biggest competition is 
ourselves," Hopkins said. "If we 
do all that we can, we are capable 
of beating any team." 

With the chlorine washed off 
and the sweet victory from the 
previous night still fresh in their 

minds, the guys dove in the pool 
once again the next day for their 
alumni game. 

"It was nice to see all the 
guys again who are recognized 
in all kinds of record books," 

" I think our 
winnings stem 

from this natural 
chemis try and 

playing as a tight 
unit. " 

- Brandon Bono, senior 
water polo cajUin 

Borso said. "They shared their 
past experiences with us and it 
was very humbling." 

Although this game did not 
affect thei r record and was sim-

ply for fun, the team now sets its 
sights and efforts on the Northern 
California Tournament at UC 
Berkeley on Oct. 15 and 16. 

The Tritons hope to win the 
first game in the tournament so 
they can advance and have a shot 
at playing UCLA and Stanford, 
whom they have yet to beat. 

The team's ultimate goals for 
the rest of the season are to win its 
Western Water Polo Association 
division and then progress to 
take the National Championship 
at Bucknell University. 

"All the guys on the team get 
along really well and hang out a 
lot outside of polo," Borso said, 
explaining the Tritons' success. 
"r think our winnings stem from 
this natural chemistry and play-
ing as a tight unit. The coaching 
staff is really working us, but aJso 
make it very enjoyable. We have 
a pretty firm belief that we have 
the ability to beat any team, any 
day. We just take it one game at a 
time and don't underestimate any 
team we come up against."

UCSD tallies four goals 
in second half to win 

Tritons post fifth, sixth straight 
shutouts over CSUSB, CSUMB 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff ¥Imler 

Fully showcasing its offensive 
and defensive taJents, the No. II 
UCSD women's soccer team erupt-
ed with four second-half goals en 
route to a 5-0 shutout of CaJ State 
San Bernardino on Oct. 5 at Triton 
Soccer Stadium. 

"The first half of the game tested 
our patience, but we had a tight 
offense that played really wen," head 
coach Brian McManus said. 

Junior Kelly Cochran scored the 
lone first-half goal for the Tritons 
(10-1-0 overall, 6-1-0 California 
Collegiate AthJetic Association) 
off a pass from freshman Nat2sha 
BeJak-Berger. Cochran beat out the 
Coyotes' keeper for the 1-0 lead with 
just under four minutes remaining in 
the first half. The goal was Cochran's 
seventh of the season. 

After intermission, the Tritons 
got back on the board quiclcly when 
sophomore Ali Lai scored from onJy 
two yards out for her fifth goal of 
the season. 

She was set up by senior Heather 
Szafraniec, who sent a pass up the 
left side to Cochran, who dribbled 
up the sideline and cut in before 
setting up Lai for the tally at the 46 
minute, 47 second mark. 

The next two goaJs for the 
Tritons came on penalty kicks, the 
first being the illegal takedown of 
freshman Kelly Mayo at the 79:13 
mark. Belak-Berger netted the pen-

aJty shot for a 3-0 Triton advantage. 
Just over four minutes later, fresh-
man Amanda Borenstein was tackJed 
hard inside the penalty area and 
caImIy made the ensuing penalty 
shot. The goals were Belak-Berger's 
fifth and Borenstein's first of the 
season, respectively. 

At the 84:43 mark, freshman 
Amanda Esquivel netted her first 
goal of the season, taking a feed from 
sophomore Lauren Segars and beat-
ing the keeper on the low side from 
10 yards out 

The 5-0 win for the Tritons was 
their sixth straight, the last five of 
which have come by way of shut-
outs. 

UCSD freshman goalkeeper Mia 
Shirley lowered her goals-against 
average to a miniscule 0.57, while 
notching her fourth-career shutout 

The team outshot the Coyotes 
by a 21-6 margin, including a 15-4 
advantage in the second half. 

"We did tremendously well on 
defense, and we killed CSUSB off 
with our offense by the second half," 
McManus said. 

The Coyotes were stifled by the 
UCSD defense, as they were limited 
to just six shots, only thrce of which 
Shirley had to save. 

The Tritons beat Cal State 
Monterey Bay 6-0 on Oct. 9 for 
their sixth straight shutout. DetaiJs 
were unavailable at press time. 

Next, UCSD will head out on 
a three-match road trip beginning 
Oct. 12 at CaJ State Bakersfield.

escape Roadrunners' late rally 

Running: Men, women take team titles 

conrin~d from page 20 
at 14- J 8. After the Roadrunners 
extended the lead to 15-20, the 
Tritons began their comeback 
attempt with four points on two of 
Courmey's 20 kills, one of Koche's 
I 3 kills and a CaJ State Bakersfield 
attack error. UCSD kept the deficit 
slim and even managed to take a 28-
27 lead for a chance at a four-game 
win. A Ries kill gave the Tritons 
a game and match point, but the 
Roadrunners would not end the 
match, scoring three straight points 
for a 29-30 lead and a game point 
of their own. Cal State Bakersfield 
would not convert the opporrunity 
and allowed the Tritons to tie the 
game up at 30, 31 and 32. Finally, 
the Roadrunners managed consecu-
tive kills [Q force game five after a 
32-34 win . 

The RoadrwUlers rode their 
momentum from game four to an 
early 5-8 lead in the deciding game. 
With Cal State Bakersfield within 
three points of a win with a 9-
12 advantage, freshman Kimberly 
Carpenter tallied one of her I 7 
kills. Following Carpenter's kill, the 
Tritons tookadvantage ofa Cal State 

Bakersfield attack error and another 
kill from Courtney and worked their 
way to a tie with the Roadrunners at 
12 apiece. Another kill from Bailey 
gave the Tritons a slim \3-12 lead, 
but Cal State Bakersfield fought 
back to a 14-14 tie. Koche's last kilJ 
of the night came at a perfect time 
to give the Tritons a match-point 
attempt. The Roadrunners called a 
timeout to delay their fine and came 
out in an attempt to tie the match-
up once again. However, Koche and 
junior Kristin Halvorsen blocked 
Roadnrnner Morgan Reed's attack 
attempt for a 16-14 game-five win 
and a 3-2 win in the match . 

The win came just a day after a 
tough loss to Cal State Los Angeles, 
wllich handed the Tritons their third 
loss in CCAA play. The Golden 
Eagles took four games to wipe 
out the Tritons and improve their 
record to 15-1 overall, 7-1 CCAA. 

Following their tough two-
game road trip, the Tritons return 
home on Oct. 15 to face No. 6 Cal

the Tritons have only eight games

Men's soccer defeats San 
Bernardino 2,1 on late PK 
Davey's goal in 65th minute gives 
Tri tons narrow. win over Coyotes 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Senior top-scorer Matthew 
Davey converted a penalty kick 
in the 65th minute of the Tritons 
Oct. 5 game against Cal State San 
Bernardino to give UCSD a 2- 1 
victory. 

Although UCSD fell behind 
ea rly, the team later rallied with 
two goals in the second half for 
a hard-fought victory over the 
Coyotes. 

Cal tate San Bernardino took a 
1-0 lead in the 19th minute, when 
sophomore Lorenzo Loson sent a 
low shot that beat UCSD senior 
goalkeeper Edward Ruhland on 
his left. 

Loson knocked in his fourth 
goal of the eason with the help 
from an assist by sophomore Brent 
Vander Eyk. The goal proved to 
be the only score for either team 
in the first half, as the Coyotes 
aggres ive ly kept the Tritons at bay 
for a 1-0 halftime lead. 

"Defensively, we started off a 
little shaky," Ruhland said. 

The quicker Coyotes out-played 
the Tritons in the first half, but by 
the time the second half came 
around, UCSD seemed determined 
to overcome their first-half woes. 

They didn't wait long, as the 
Triton got the equalizer in the 
55t1, minute. After junior Matt 
Horne sent a long ball across the 
right ide, it bounded forward 
and was gamered by senior Grant 
Nishio. Nishio used his right foot 
to slam the ball to the lower left 
side of the goal, beating junior Ca l 
State San Bernardino goalkeeper 

Pepi Lucas for his fourth tally of 
me season. 

"Nishio's goal was a pivotal 
point for the team because it was 
such a big confidence booster," 
Ruhland said. 

T he Tritons out-shot the 
Coyotes by a 7-5 margin in the 
second half, and continued to put 
pressure on their defense. 

T hat pressure paid off in 
me 66m minute as junior Ryan 
Velasquez streaked down the left 
side and was taken down inside me 
top-left corner of the penalty box. 

Davey sent the ball to the right 
corner on the penalty kick where 
Lucas got a hand on it, but could 
not stop it from going in, giving 
the Tritons a 2- 1 lead. 

T he goal was Davey'S seventh 
on the season. 

"In the second half of the game, 
we had a well-organized defense 
that enabled our offense to score," 
Ruhland said. 

UCSD played tough defense, 
limiting Cal State San Bernardino 
to just two shots on goa l. T he 
Coyotes saw six serious tries by 
the T ritons, but Lucas saved four 
of them. 

Neither team mounted another 
serious scoring threat after the 
penalty kick as UCSD held on tor 
its first come-from-behind victory 
of the season. 

T he Tritons hold a one-point 
advantage over both Cal State 
San Bernardino and Ca l State

By RAIL ENlEEN

T he No. 13 women's volleyball

pointing 1-3 loss to No. 16 Cal 
State Los Angeles on Oct. 6 with a 
narrow five-game win over Cal State 
Bakersfield the following day. 

T he Tritons (14-4 overall , 6-
3 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) split their CCM 
road trip with the win over the 
Roadrunners following the loss to 
the Golden Eagles. 

The Tlitons came into the game 
against Ca l State Bakersfield on a 
two-game losing streak, the first 
time the Tritons have had back-
to-back losses all season. However, 
UCSD came out fighting and, with 
the 3-2 win, ended the streak. 

The Tritons did not look like 
winners throughout their match-up 
with the Roadrunners, allowing Cal 
State Bakersfield to win two games 
and almost giving away the final 
game and the match. 

In game one, the Tritons took a 
quick 11-6 lead before scoring seven 
unanswered points to extend their 
advantage to 18-6. The twelve-point 
lead held up and the Tritons won 
the opening game 30-17. 

in game one, the Tritons took 
an early 11 -6 lead in the second. This 

time, the Tritons couldn't maintain 
the lead and the Roadrunners went 
on a 10-5 run to tie the game up 
at 16 apiece. Cal State Bakersfield 
then took advantage of four straight 
Triton attack errors to move ahead, 
16-19. The Tritons worked their 
way back to a 19-19 tie, but it did 
not last as Cal State Bakersfield 
scored four straight points again for 
a 19-23 advantage. The Tritons got 
as close as 26-28 late in the game, 
but the Roadrunners were able to 
hold them off for a 27-30 victory 
in game two and a 1-1 tie in the 
match. 

The Tritons looked to fresh-
man Rebecca Bailey, sophomore 
Amber Ries and juniors Nicole 
Courmey and Brianna Koche for a 
win in game three. Bailey'S back-to-
back aces and one of Ries' 16 ki lls 
gave the Tritons a 15-10 lead. The 
Roadrunners started to claw their 
way back with two straight points, 
but two aces from Counncy gave 
the Tritons back their commanding 
lead of 20- 13 . Koche sent down the 
final kill for a 30-2 1 win in game 
three and a 2-1 UC D advantage in 
the match. 

On the brink of elimination, Cal 
State Bakersfield managed to take 
the first significant lead of game four

Borso pounded in the Tritons'

is almost routine and is just an 
indication that practice is pay-
ing off."

remaining in the first quarter, 
senior Chris Finegold contrib-
uted another goal to give the 
Tritons their first lead.
