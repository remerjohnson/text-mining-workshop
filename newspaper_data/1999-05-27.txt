Angry Protestors Demand 
Diversity, Fair Treatment 
RALLY: UPTE union members, 
SAAC demonstrate Wednesday 
outside Chancellor Dynes' office 
By Vincent Graenanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students, faculty and staff demonstrated yes-
terday outside the adminislrdlive complex to 
voice their concerns over the declining number 
of underrepresented minority students at UCSD 
and the University of California's treatment of 

Supporters of the rally dressed in black and 
wore red armbands in response to what they 
called a "death of diversity." 

Roosevelt junior and SAAC Chair Annelle 
Greene spoke on what she said is a lack of minor-
ity students and facullY and the hypocrisy of uni-
versity administrators. 

"All the university does is lie to us," Greene 
said. 'They throw out 'principles of communi-
ty'" everywhere but do (hey abide by it'! No." 

Literature Professor Ann Ducille spoke on her 
experiences as an East Coast native coming to 

professional researchers. 
The issues being prolested 

were originally part of two sepa-
rate demonstrations coincidenlal-
Iy planned on the same day at the 
same place. The Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
(SAAC) stated its rally, tilled 
"Death of Diversity," was in 
response to new admissions dala

"It's interesting to see on the 

Literature Professor news how readi Iy people of San 

to increase outreach and retention for underrep- . 
resented minorities at UCSD. 

In addition, the fliers stated demands for the 
university to create and maintain a standing com-
mittee for visitations for middle and high school 
students, increased funds for scholarships, 
.aggressive recruitment and retention of faculty of 
color and women and the inclusion of ethnic, 
queer and women's studies in the requirements 
for students of the future sixth college.

to refugees from Kosovo while we shoot 
Mexicans," Ducille conlinued. "We then deny 
them access to health care and the education lhat 
might help prepare Ihem for the UC system wohere 
209 tells them they ' re not welcome anyway." 

Revelle senior Keith DeWalt said that he 
believes if the decline in the number African 
Americans at UCSD continues, they will soon be 
driven totally out of the university.

Expansion 
Project 
Underway 
CONSTRUCTION: 2,660 
square feet will be added to 
the Career Services Center 
By Jennifer Kaplan 
Guardian Reporter 

By the early fall of 1999, the Career 
Services Center plans to have completed 
ex pansions to make. its facilit ies accessi-
ble to more students. The expansion pro· 
ject, which is currently underway, is 
focused on enlarging the center's multi-
purpose room and adding more inter-
viewing areas and student offi ces. 

The center's multi-purpose room will 
he expanded by 560 square feet. In addi-
tion, 1,090 square feet wi II be added to 
build six new interviewing rooms, an 
employer lounge and student lounges 
with more privacy. 

The final phase of expansion includes 
'the construction of five new office spaces 
totaling 1,010 square feet for student 
employees, graduate interns, meetings, 
staff and equipment. 

When the project is completed, an 
overall 2,660 square feet will be added to 
the Career Services Center, costing a 
total of $500,000. 

The multi-purpose room is commonly 
used for educating students through 
panel presenlations and open house.s by 
alumni and employers, Director of 
Career Services Neil Murray said. 

Marketing Specialist for the Career 
Services Center Carolyn Pang said that 
many presentations currently held in this 
room are overcrowded to the point where 
students are sitting on the ground and 
some can't even attend. 

The multi -purpose room currently 
hold5 lip to 60 people, whereas Murray 
anticipates that the addition will accom-
modate up to 100 people. 

He said that amenities such as air con-
ditioning and a better sound system will 
be installed in the room to "diversify 
usage of the room for those attending so 
Ihey can better enjoy the resources." 

Pang said thaI a platform will also be 
added to the multi-purpose room to ele-
vare presenters so they can be visible 
even to those students sitling in the back. 

Muir sophomore Terra Horton said 
she thought the expansions were a bene-
fit to students who use the Career 
Services Cenler. 

"I feel that the expansions to the 
mUlti-purpose room will be a great bene-
fit because the events held in the past 
have been extremely infonnative, and 
now even more students will be able to 
engage in programs," Horton said. 

Pang said that the new interviewing 
rooms will accommodate actual job

RALLY: 
Protestors angered 
over new admit data 
Continued from ..... 1 

"Every year we get burned," 
DeWalt sa id. " I' ve got two words 
for UCSD: Fuck you. UCSD is a 
place where you can say diversity 
but you can' t see di versity. If we 
don' t stop this soon I'm going to be 
on the plantation looking for the 
master." 

DeWalt also referred to the fact 
that the protesters were urT.lble to 
speak with the chancellor. 

" Maybe if they don' t open the 
doors. we' ll have to break the win-
dow and go in through the win-
dows." he added. 

Edwina Welch. director of the 
Cross Cultural Center, also spoke 
on what she said is a lack of di ver-
sity at UCSD. 

She said she was appalled at the 
fact that those' students who work 
hardest for diversity are often mar-
ginali zed as radicals by some mem-
bers of the UCSD community. 

Welch also said that she 
believes it is important for all stu-
dents to be exposed to a diverse 
campus environment. 

" If our students graduate from 
this university without having any 
diversity ... I don' t want these peo-
ple to be the champion leaders in 
industry." 

A statement from tbe chancel -
lor 's office outlined the university 'S 
current efforts 10 increase diversity 
at UCSD. 

Efforts include a plan to admit 
the top 4 percent of graduating 
seniors in San Diego and Imperial 
Counties to UCSD as well as the 
development of the Preuss School, 
which will prepare educationally 
underscrvcd students for UCSD. 

• Providing scholarships to under-
represented students was also listed 
as an effort . 

UCSD announced Tuesday the 
composit ion of the 1999 freshman 
class, which wil lJ consist of 3,490 
students. The students were drawn 
from a record pool of 32,500 fresh-
man applicants. The mean high 
school grade point aver.lge o f the 
incoming class is 3.97 and its mean 
S.'A.T. score is 1256. 

The fall freshman c1a.~s 'will have 
297 underrepresented students. 2.9 
percent le~s than last year.

AD DEADLINE: 
Tues. June 1 

Underrepresented students will 
comprise 8.4 percent of the m . .'cepted 
freshmen. Underrepresented stu: 
dents include Nati ve Americans, 
African Americans and M exican 
Americans. 

T hcre will be 252 M exican 
A merican students. which is up 
12.5 percent from last year; 33 
African American students, which 
is a decrease of 45 percent from last 
year and 12 Nati ve American stu-
dents. which is a decrease of 45.5 
percent from last year. 

Vi ce Chance llor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson stated that 
he has mixed feelings about the 
admissions data. 

" We are delighted by the superb 
students attracted to UCSD and their 
exce llent academic credentials," 
Watson stated. " We are also deeply 
disappointed by the number of stu-
dents from underrepresented racial 
groups in our entering class, particu-
larly the decrease in African 
American and Native American stu-
dents. The university is detennined 
to reverse this trend and substantial-
ly increase the nuinber of new stu-
dents from the three underserved 
populations." 

A ss istant Vice Chancellor of 
Admi ssions and Regi strations 
Richard Backer said he will contin-
ue to work to reverse the dectine in 
underrepresented siudents. 

" We were very disappointed by 
the numbers and we wil~ continue 
to recruit underrepresented stu-
dents," Backer said. 

He addtXI that because many out-
reach efforts are aimed at middle and 
fiigh school students, it may take a 
few years to reverse the current trend. 

Fifty-live of the incoming fresh-
men are residents of San Diego and 
Imperial Counties who were accept-
ed as a direct result of UCSD's new 
policy guar.lnteeing admission 10 
local UC-eligible seniors who place 
in the top 4 percent of their graduat-
ing high school class. 

Yesterday 's demonstration also 
included members of the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees union (UPTE). A state-
ment from the union stated that 
over the past six years, more than 
$16 mi Ilion has been diverted or re-
budgeted from money intended for 
researcher wages. 

UPTE President Jelger Kalmijn 
said that many university

One gigantic !lop to the admissions offi ce 
and Housing and Dining Services for admitting 
too many freshman and then packing them in 
like sailors on a submarine. 110 percent is good 
for the fencing team, not housing capac ity. Now 
even if you survi ve the food, you must worry 
about your roommates rolling over and smother-
ing you in the night. 

Hurrah for Dave Dillon, beloved assistant 
basketball coach and savior of UCSD spirit. 
Dave endured two weeks of residence atop 
RIMAC's roof to convince the UCSD communi -
ty to come out and support its sports teams. 

Thumb~; down to refinery disa ters and OPEC. 
An unfortunate series of events has driven gaso-
line prices to staggering heights, especially in 
Californi a. It 's almost enough to make us resort to 
San Diego's first-class mass transit system. 

Kudos to the administration for reinstating 
All Campus Commencement. Even if most of us 
don' t attend the ceremony, it 's nice to know that 
it's there for those of us who want it. Special 
thanks to Qualcomm founder and CEO Irwin 
Jacobs fo r being thi s year's speaker. 

Congratulations to TAs for sticking it to the 
Man and making Him recognize after 16 years 
of struggle. The administration, however, has 
been dragging its feet with the issue and has yet 
to full y cooperate with students. 

Props to the University Centers Advisory 
Board (UCAB) for making UCSD a better envi-
ronment for all students. Even with the continuous 

incrc;:~e i:1 student population, UCAB has man-

A FLOOD OF OPINIONS ONLY 
DROWNS OUT· THE TRUTH 

COMMENTARY: 
America has lost its 
morals and ethics in a 
noisy sea of voices 
By Jenna Barclay 
Staff Writer 

When our founding fathers signed 
the United States Constitution in 1789 
it was the dawn of a new age of civi l 
and human rights. 

It permitted the creat ion of a previ-
ously invisible agent - God's most 
exquisite of inventions, mans ' greatest 
of tools. 

It was the container of harmonious 
expression, long suppressed by social 
stratum and intolerant tyrants, which 
at last breached the surface of a deaf-
ened and narrow-minded world: the 
voice of the common man . 

No longer wO\olld his ('TY be stilled 
by a society finely and inextricably 
limited by the barriers of social hierar-
chy and divine reasoning. On the cl)n-
trary, it was the aching sound of his 
plea that spurred this necessary change 
and inspired a more compassionate 
society. 

There would no longer be any 
abridgment of speech, press, the right 
to assemble and petition for redress 
of grievances . The First Amendment 
of the Constitution granted the l:om-
mon man (in theory at least) a place 
and a voice on the social and political 
platform. With that rinal li ck of the 
qui" a torrent of vo ices were 
re leased. 

Yet, within these torrents some-
thing else has evolved. It is another 
sound, another cry; a noise far more 
thunderous than the roars of history 'S 
grandest battles and far more piercing 
than the wails of history's most tor-
tured victims. 

This noi se, this unruly clamor, is 
nothing less than the roar of our 
ove rtly opinionated modern man . 

In the roar of so many 
different bell.fs and 
opll.lons flowing out 
from every cr.vlce of 
the room, the 
television acting as 
the centerpiece for 
family gatherings and 
religion losing Its role 
as a communal glue, 
the public has lost Its 
moral compass. Yes, 
we are all free to 
voice an opinion, but 
what good Is one 
opinion In the 
thunderous tumult of 
millions? 
With doser attention he might recog-
nize that despicable roar as hi s own. 

Our culture was founded on the tol -
erance of varying ideas. It is one of the 
traits that has enabled America to 
develop into such a diverse and 
dynamic place to live. However, what 
had commenced as a sea of impas-
. ioned voices, desirous of social 
change, has evolved into a turgid pool 

of, too often, meaningless human 
moaning. 

Between the moronic guests of 
Jerry Springer, the amoral 
expounders of Howard Stern, and the 
one trillion ot her television and radio-
talk shows that broadl:ast the convic-
tions of other such individuals, the 
typical American cannot help but 
become desensitized to the value of a 
singular opinion. 

It is a wonder, in fact , that in this 
age of communications, including e: 
mail, pagers, cell phoncs and the 
Internet, that the country does not 
shatter from the resonance of all this 
talking. 

Or, perhaps it has, and the shards 
are not yet visible. 

One needs to take only a brief look 
around to realize that this country has 
sunk into moral decay. While the stan-
dard of living has improved remark-
ably, the political and moral frame-
work of this society has broken down. 
Fine class delineations and deeply 
entrenched religious beliefs of an 
older world have morphed into swamp 
of political and moral ambiguities. 
While the oppressiveness and limita-
tions of yesteryear have been lost, so 
has its clearness of motive and pur-
pose. 

The nature of our role in Kosovo is 
disturbingly vague: NATO uses vio-
lence to do away with violence. The 
cost of our bombs has actually sur-
passed the cost of humanitarian aid in 
the region . (Tillie, May 17, 1999) 

In the wake of negotiations with 
Milosevic and middle man Yeltsin, the 
alliance has already backed down on 
three of its five initial core demands to 
the Serbian president. 

How is the average person sup-
posed to understand what America's 
real purpose is for interfering in 
Kosovo? 

What is also noteworthy is the fact

TAs/GAs DESERVE RESPECT 
Editor: 

I am someone who fought for 
union recogni tion three years ago, 
and I am delighted to find out that 
the light has finally lead 10 results. 
Our TAs/GAs deserve to be treated 
with dignity and respect and need to 
be compensated at a level that 
rew~rds them for their hard work . 
As an undergraduate majoring in 
political science, I was very 
impressed with the TAs/GAs on our 
campus. I want to take this opportu-
nity to personally thank all of my 
TAs/GAs for their help and dedica-
tion to my education. Thank you .

Crying 'Racist' 
Editor: 

I was curious to know if Cathy 
Brazi l ("Monticello's Black 
Sheep," May 20) had any facts to 
back up the aCl:usations of racism 
she was throwing at the Monticello 
Association for its handling of the 
new evidence of Thomas 
Jefferson 's descendants by his 
African American "mistress" Sally 
Hemings. (I' ll get to the quotes 
around the mistress in a moment.) 

In the motion that was presented 
to eject some of the newly discov-
ered descendants from the associa-
tion's meeting. Brazil writes, "the 
Illotion to eject them failed, 33-20, 
but the message was definitely clear. 
The others didn't want the Hemings' 
descendants there .... " Wait a second

... didn 't the motion to eject themjaiL 
33-20? Apparently, there were 33 
members of the association that felt 
that yes, the newly discovered 
African American descendants 
should in fact be able to take part in 
the luncheon/meeting. 

Her three-column criticism of 
the association seems to be based a 
lot more on whal she "felt" the 
association was up to rather than 
any blatantly racist or degrading 
insults, epithets or facts that would 
indeed be worthy of denouncement. 

Brazil writes, "I can't help but 
feel that if Hemings descendants 
were white, none of these . delays

would ever have happened." She 
may be right , and thus justified in 
her criticisms. But again , what facts 
are there that would speak to this? 

Here are some facts : Thomas 
Jefferson's wife die<l in May 1782. 
Sally Hemings did not start having 
chi Idren unti I after she and one of 
Jefferson's daughters retumed from 
Paris in 1787. Thus, though he didn 't 
again marry, there is no evidence 
that Jefferson would have had a rela-
tionship with Sally going back fi ve 
years previously when he would in 
fact have committed adultery. 

The dominating stream of 
thought ... is so quick to paint the 
picture that Thomas Jefferson was a 
debased racist because he owned 
slaves. Frederick Douglass, in his 
earlier years did the same. At first, 
he saw Jefferson as a rank hypocrite 
as the Declaration of Independence 
and ideals of equality that Jefferson 
put forth were in direct opposition 
to his uwnership of slaves. 

However, as Douglass began to 
read deeper into Jefferson's life and 
the immense inner strugg les 
Jefferson went through trying to rec-
onci le the slave society that was 
intertwined into his cu lture and his 
fundamental beliefs of human 
equality, Douglass came to forgive 
Jefferson. Merrill Peterson, a widely 
recognized Jell'erson scholar, writes, 
"by all accounts, he was a kind and 
generous master. His conviction of 
the injustice of the institution 
strengthened his sense of obligation 
toward its victims."

6 OPINION 

NOISE: 
Dail y dose of data is 
difficult to decipher 
~ontInued from ..... 4 
that thi s interference defi es 
NATO's origi nal purpose: to pro-
tect all of Europe through solely 
defensive measures. This purpose 
has been revised to suit the si tua-
tion in Kosovo. which is dea rly 
aggressi ve. 

One would expect the nature of 
thi s allac k to damage the 
American psyc he. However. 
behind the hlazes of medi a and 
insatiahle commentary one starts 
to wonder if there wi ll be any 
effect at all. Beneath the di versity. 
the brilliance and the agility of our 
nation. nati onal and commun al 
spirit has degenerated into infec -
tious apathy. 

Thi s apathy is not the result of 
too few opinions. but of too many 
smothering average citizens into 
babbling idiots. Everyone has 
something to say; however. no 
one has the time or the capacity to 
listen. Plus. we are bombarded hy 
so much data on a daily hasis that 
it is difficult to make sense of any 
of it. 

Boundaries of expression have 
become limitless. Words may be 
spewed at the drop of a hat. just as 
relations may be fo rged and broken 
in the lash of a changing political 
wind. 

Treason and heresy are mere 
anachroni sms in thi s time of 
tabloid . talk shows. pom. open 
political philanderi ng and slander. 
Nothing is made 10 be permanent 
or absolute. It is all subject to 
ridicule. manipulation and eventual 

change. Even worse. there is no 
higher mClrality or obligation that 
holds us accountable. 

Universal standards no longer 
exist. People are unable to cling to 
a solid, ideological framework to 
anchor their beliefs and dec isions. 
There are too many choices. As a 
result , they sail off into a contrary 
and hypocritica l void simply 
because there is no higher reli -
gious or moral standard that pre-
vents them from doing so. This 
was the case with NATO's revi -

. sions. 
In the roar of so many different 

beliefs and opinions flowin g out 
from every crevice of the room. the 
television acting as the centerpiece 
for family gatherings and religion 
losing its role as a communal glue, 
the public has los1 its moral com-
pass. Yes, we are all free to voice 
an opinion. but what good is one 
opinion in the thunderous rumult of 
millions? 

Single truths lose their value in 
the overwhelming mass of equally 
viable theories. The only thing to 
do is mentally switch off. and this 
is exactly what America has done 
in the last three decades. 

Thus, when an atrocity such as 
Kosovo's genocide occurs the 
American public finds itself 
strangely disassociated from the 
horror despite thl! barrage of edito-
rials and media coverage. So much 
gore and despair has already been 
revealed to us through movies, doc-
uments and other horrific media 
coverage that it is difficult to 
inspire the sa:ne initial feelings of 
revulsion in u . 

NATO's hypocri sies and the 
ambivalence of America's role in 
Kosovo also inspires little reaction. 

The UCSD Guardian 

The affair has become so muddled 
and skewed by so many different 
angles that we are left dazed and 
with little more to do then wait for 
the final showdown - praying that 
our beloved economy will not be 
wounded. 

When faced with domesti c 
tragedy and 11I0rai reevaluation as 
in the case of Columbine High 
School, the colorful American pub-
lic. like an iridescent prism. fre.: ly 
deflects the blame in S,OOO differ-
ent directions. 

Be it the video game maker, the 
lilm producer or the negligent par-
ent next door, the absence of a 
moral reference leads society to a 
sort of national moral bewilder-
ment, a spiraling self-deprecation 
in which ridiculous scapegoats are 
recklessly pursued. The idea that 
there was a correlation between 
those shootings and black trench 
coats is absurd. 

While the average person 
enjoys more rights then ever hefore 
in western history. he has lost that 
neces ary societal cohesiveness 
that is formed by universally 
accepted codes of morality. 

Until a more tangible moral 
framework is constructed and 
deemed superior to its multitudi-
nous rivals. America shall continue 
to noisily spew weak opinions 
while tlailing in the obscurity of its 
own blurring ethics. 

What began in the dawn of the 
moclt:rn era as the chirp of an elat-
ed little lark, long denied the luxu-
ry of being heard. has regrettably 
exploded into a flurry of voices that 
has grown into a single, terrible 
note of useless opinion.

Jefferson had a great deal of 
respect for the expert craftsman-

the time possessed. He knew that 
Monticello wouldn' t have existed 
were it not for the awesome con-
tribution of his slaves. Likewise. 
he granted many of those slaves

freedom upon his death. No one 
of any integrity. including 
Jefferson. would deny that slav-

s.nat. Bill Vlolat.s 
Students' Rights 
Editor: 

We want to inform you about a 
bill that is being debated in the 
California Senate. SB 64S. intro-
duced by Sen. John Jlurton. seeks 
to directly impose agency shop 
fees on all eligible UC graduate 
and undergraduate students 
whether they choose to join the 
union or not. 

Thus, this bill directly affects 
you! We strongly object to SB 
64S, and here's why: 

First. this bill takes away ),our 
right to choose to support a union. 
Most students teach during their 

Thursday, May 27, 1999 

graduate career. The vote for or 
against unionization is one of the 
most important votes we will have 
ever cast as it directly affects our 
working conditions and our pay-
check. It is unacceptable to us that 
this bill was introduced to the 
Senate after elections regarding 
unionization were already cast at 
three UC schools. To now man-
date that we mu t all pay agency 
shop fees whether we are union 
members or not is unfair. 

Second, this bill would be 
unprecedented! The idea of 
bypassing the collective bargain-
ing process to unilaterally imple-
ment an agency fee arrangement 
would be unprecedented in the 
public sector in California. It 
could, in fact, set a precedent of 
actually reducing employee rights 
by imposing conditions rather 
than allowing them to be voted on 
by its members. 

Third. our primary job in a uni-
versity is to be a student. If others 
wish to be involved with a union 
during their graduate school career, 
that is their righl. It should also be 
our right to refuse membership and 
to not pay any union fees. 

We urge you to voice your 
objections and get involved! Let 
your chancellor, Gov. Gray Davis 
and the state senators know of 
your dissatisfaction with S8 64S.

Murray added that the Capital

E venings like this exemplify the joys of university life. One goes to the local student-run restaurant/venue to par-take of the delicious, cheap all-you-can-eat fare. As luck would have it , 
there happen to be two student poetry readings, fol -
lowed by music by the Prince Myshkins, the witti-
est group in the area. 

Last Thursday's all-you-can-eat at the Che started 
off with poetry readings by senior Clara Hennen and 
freshman Sarra Alpert. Audience members listened 
appreciatively while eati ng their Sloppy Janes, salad 
with a deliciously strong garlic dressing, and the 
famous Chi! cookies. (Cousin to the more traditional 
"Sloppy Joe," a Sloppy Jane is made of tofu instead 
of ground beef.) 

After Alpert fini shed, the Prince My hkins took 
the stage. The two-man group sings hilarious, 
politically minded songs on a plethora of subjects. 
Andy Gricevich play guitar and Rick Burkhardt 
plays accordion; both sing. 

In addition to a technically talented yet sing-
along ·ound. the Myshkins ' songs have insanely 
clever lyrics. The polit ical commentary is often 
mocking and sarcastic, and there are plenty of puns 
and sharp one- liners. For example. while singing 
about adverti sing in "Nothing on the Moon," they 
declare that in the future, "The dimple on your 
race/will be an adverti sing space!" 

Other songs on the program included "There is 
No God But Zilla," which mocks Hollywood and 
the film industry, "Tinky Winky," which was jok-
ingly dedicated to the Christian Right , and "The 
Approval Song," which talks about social pre sures 
and their ugly results on both large and small scales. 

The My hkin have a small but devoted fol/ow-
ing. The audience cheered and clapped rhythmical-
ly. Senior hi story major Jonna Howden claims to 
he their number one fan. 

" I don't want kids. but I want to have their 
kids!" she said emphatica lly. 

The Myshkins played sevcn songs before rush-
ing orr to Mandevi l/e for a performa nce of a di f~ 
rerent type - the rirst evening performance of the 
Festival of ew Music at UC D. Burkhardt, who 
is fi nishing hi s masters degree in omposlllOn , 
also had a piece he co-wrote performed Wednesday 
night , in the finale of the festiva l. 

The Gllardian spoke with Gricevich after the 
perfo rmance and with Burkhardt by phone. 
Guardian: Can you tell us a little about 
Prince Mysllkln? 

Burkhardt: Prince Myshkin i the main chara('-
ter in Fyodor Dosteyevsky's The Idiot. He's a 
noble, but he feels sorry for the poor and does 
good-hearted - if misguided from a Marxist per-
spective - philanthropic deeds. The other nobles 
call him an idiot for this. 
Do you play anything besides the accor· 
dlon? 

I play piano and guitar. 
What kinds of Instrumants do you write 
music for? 

As a student of classical compo ition, I write 
mu IC fo r small groups of traditional instruments 
played in non-traditional ways. 
Such as playing guitar. with pencils, like 
they did In the New Music Festival's rend~ 
tlon of the Stockhau .... piec:e thursday? 

Duo: Andy Gncerich (left) and Rick Burkhardt 
include in their repertoire a cover of "Rubber 
Ducky.' They make more than bathtime fun. 

That would probably be the most normal thing 
in one of my compositions. 'usually have to invent 
special symbols to explai n to the musician who is 
playing my music what they should do. For exam-
ple, how do you explain with classical notation, 
"Play this note while pres ing harder with the bow 
than you usually do" or "tap on the violi n",? 

Normally when a person learns to play an 
instrument, they learn to do probably five different 
things at once. The idea I'm .interested in is the 
sound that happens if you treat these five things 
like live separate elements. I'm interested in this 
for political reasons. There's a political dimension 
to the fact that we are habi tuated to certain thought 
processes and actions. . 
In ra,... to _xu.1 politic .... . 

I don't feel like a member of a gay community; 
[ feel like a member of an activist community. 
Everyone's sexuality is fluid ... if we could only 
admit th is, life would be safer, in every sense. 
Falling in love wouldn't be such a dire thing. 
Whera do you see yourself going with 
music? 

I like the Prince Myshkins and I like thi s [clas-
sical compo itionJ . and at this point' want to keep 
them separate because they' re both so interesting 
that they might lose something if , blended them 
together. Maybe eventually I can create cir-
cumstances in which they can come 
together in some sneaky way ;

LUCAS' 'PHANTOM' FALLS FLAT 
Poor writing and weak storyline leave fans disappointed EATING DISORDER 

Day Treatment Program By Dave Yen 
Staff Writer 

Obi-Wan Kenobi 's first lines in 
"Star Wars : Episode '" as he arrives 
at the planet Naboo are "I have a 
bad feeling about this." That pretty 
much summarizes the entire movie. 

The media sensation known as 
"The Phantom Menace" is not so 
much a movie as it is a marketing 
scheme. Director George Lucas 
somehow decided in the last five 
years that he needed more money 
(or publicity or both) and set out to 
wri te a screenplay featuring daz-
zling visual effects, ' pectacular 
lightsaber duels, and enough char-
acters and creatures to fi II up an 
entire aisle of action ligures. 

So far it has worked . Star Wars 
raked in $102 million ir. its /irst 

five days, easily topping the previ-
ous largest opening of $92 million 
set by "The Lost ·World." 

The film opens with Jedi 
knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Nee-
son) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan 
MacGregor) traveling to the planet 
Naboo in order to nfgotiate a treaty 
with the Trade Federation. Un us-
pecti ng, they walk into a trap and 
are forced to fight their way 
through an impressive array of bat-
tle droids. Here, Lucas has sur-
passed him elf by creating a fright-
ening new species of evil warriors 
who bare a faint resemblance to the 
stormtroopers of his previous 
films. 

Once clear from immediate dan-
ger, the two ledis embark on a 
series of <Idventures, accompanied 

by an annoying sidekick, until they 
fi nd themselves on the planet 
Tatooine where the real story 
begins. 

What is unclear is why Lucas 
felt it was neces ary to open the 
picture with mind-boggling action 
sequences and special effects. He 
thrusts his slew of characters into 
the middle of chaos, hoping that by 
mere heroism and light scenes, he 
could again endear him elf to the 
legions of the Star Wars faithful. 

We get no explanation for why 
the Jedi are on their mission or 
more importantly, who they are. 
They talk in action-driven staccato 
dialogue featuri ng cheesy one- lin-
ers and random jabs at humor. 

To make matters worse, there is

Drum and Bass master Mocean 
Worker (a.k.a. Adam Dam) has 
innovatively comhined contempo-
rary trends with previous 20th centu-
ry themes. While Mixed Emotiollal 
Feaw/,e.\· may nOl strike the listener 
as particu larly inspired in its repeti -
tive, cmnputcr-genentted sound, the 
marriage helwccn electronka and 
jazz motives is an undeniahlc hreak-
through. 

Dom, pcrhaps responding to the 
lack of rhythmic variety in electron-
ic dance music, has fused complex 
meters in jazz with the poundi ng 
bass of the modem d ub scene to 
produce a unique hyhrid. 

Mixed neither has its place in the 
jazz tradition nor in the dance cul-
ture. Howe"er, Adam Dom may 
have opened up the genre of popular 
elcctmnic music to more complicat-
ed and all -enc'Ompassi ng themes. As 
the 215t century approache;,_ one 
would hope th3ltechnology in music 
wi ll continue to he pushed further.

ing The Rentals wi ll retum to the fun 
they delivered with thei r hit single 
"Friends of P." 

Vocalist Matt Sharp, be ller 
known for his bass work in the 
power-pop guitar band Weezer, 
wrote the album 's 15 tracks. Wj1ile 
most stick to catchy vocals ("Hello, 
Hello") and Io-li electronic giddi-
ness (''The Cntisc"), too many of the 
radio-friendly songs stray to~ard 
raw count ry or lackluster punk. 

The Rentals are a hands-in-the-

Blur's latcst release and six th 

albulII to date, 13, is sune to please 
thei r tnte lans as well as spark new 
ones. 

Lead singer Dalllon Albam has 
reached his pinn.de as a song writer, 
chuming out deeply pcrsonal and 
sensitive lyrics. 

On 11, Blur fuses together a vari-
ety of styles to provide somcthing 
for every taste. The eclectic mix of 
genres range from gospel ('"Tender") 
to folk ("Trimm Trabb") to ambient 
rock ("Batt Ie") to punk 
("B.L.l1.R.E.M.I."). The wave of 
emolions is t.:onstantly ri sing ami 
falli.ng from peaceful gospel choirs 
to raw ro<:k 'n' mil ("Bugman" and 
"Swamp Song") to solemn laments 
for old lovers ("1992" and "Trai ler-
park"). 

While there is a definite hreak 
from the Brit-POp of older albums, 
I.i is sli ll &,Iioctly Blur due to its 
wide range of instruments and 
experimentation with sound.

The Ultimately Empty Million Pounds 

..... , .. ..--.

.* •• 

Ne"er boring, The Ullimately 
Empty Million POllndj' stealthily 
slithers its way through a number of 
dill'erent genres, giving the listener 
the sensation of Ilipping madly 
through the channels on an old 
Zenith television. 

Funki Porcini's music (he insists 
that is his real name) has been 
desaihed as "a trip around a bed-
lam-addled musical sex asy lum." 
His eclectic sty le of "pcrv-beat" or 
"sex-hop" inliltrated Ninja Tune 
Records in 1993 ~ith the lirst of sev-
erJ I 12-inch sing l~s entitled '"Take 
WThe Herb." 

"My music is rather like good 
pornography, I suppose," Porcini 
commented. 

After leaving London at age 19, 
he has heen involved in the ambient 
industrial scene in San Francisco aod 
Los Angeles, as well as the jazz 
scene in Germany and Italy. His 
eclectic musical hack ground enables 
him to tmnsverse a variety of genre,. 

From the silkily sinister "'Theme 

Thursday, May 27, 1999 

from Sugar Daddy," reminiscent of a 
chase scene in a James Bond movie. 
to the smooth collage of "Nothing 10 
Do ," Millio/l Pounds is viscerally 
pleasurable yet unnerving at the 
same timc. There's somcthin g 
strangely pcrverted about li stening 
to this alhum a~ if your mother might 
walk in at any moment. 

111C highli ghts of the album arc 
the high-energy jazz-j unglelhip-hop 
track "Live Fast," the beautifully . 
sedative track "Wilson's Millions" 
and the intense "Rockit Soul." 

This album is not for evcrvonc. If 
you like your hip-hop simple and 
predictable, then don't buy Million 
Pound.,. If you like your music cere-
bral and eclectic then Porcini is the 
man to check out. 

Although Millio/l POI/nds is nOl 
accessible to everyone, it does have 
enough funky beats to keep you tap-
ping your loes if not giggling ner-
vously. Poreini has not strayed much 
from his earlier releases, but "perv-
beat" is dcfinitely a genre that leaves 
room for exploration.

Jar Jar Binks, Lucas' latest furry side-

While Anakin ilpreilfS as a 
good- looki ng. likable kid. he lacks 
any special characteristics to make 
him the suhject of the greatcst 
series of stories ever told . We don ' t 
sense what is trul y spec ial , or dan-
gerous, ~bout him. 

Lucas justifics this by proclaim-
ing that Anakin's conversion to the 
dark side bq;ins in "Episode 2." He 
assumes correctly that, even had he 
made Obi-Wan reiLd transcripts of a 
legal proceeding for the lirst two 
hours, audiences would still flock 
to see the second IiIm. But every 
movie is a story in itself. Even the 
tirst three Star Wars IiIms could 
have theoretically cKisted hy them-

We're preUy weind, and political 
music doesn't have the same kind of 
fan base as love songs do. Yoo can't 
make a hit with our songs (not that I 
would want us to). For the most part, 
oven political song writing is kepi off 
rddio stations. This is not an accident. 

There's an imponant use for this 
kind of music. It gives people an 
excuse to get log ether and talk 
about things that they don't think 
about nonnally. Our society has a 
way of isolating people. 

We' re always being fed infor-
mation about ourselves. In the 
media Americans are described as 
ignorant, apathetic creatures, but I 
don't lind mu_ch evidence of this in 
my life. I think people are intelli-
gent, and that they care about 
things. But it 's the same phenome-
non as in grade school: kids that get 
told they ' re dumb don't do well . 

I notice that when a group of pe0-
ple go to concen and hear a song that 
makes them realize that they have 
opinions about something, suddenly 
they ' re really interested. They perk 
up, they're awake. This happens a 
lot to us. We do a song, and it turns 
out that people really aren't stupid.

through no fault of our own. 
Eventually we did what we do best: 
sniff out the booze. I'm not at lib-
erty to say what went on, but let's 
just say the party just kept on 
going. 

At midnight, the music ended 
and we all liled off of the boat to 
the shuttles. After making a few 
lewd w mments about female ath-
letes, our driver popped hi s experi-
mental bass music into the tape 
deck and proceeded to try to drop 
us off at SDSU. At this, I was actu-
ally kind of honored. Who says 
UCSD can' t party like State? 
Eventually we made our way back 
to La Jolla, trying to keep our nar-
coleptic driver awake with talk 
about hi s amazingly stimulating 
job. 

On tbe walk home from 
Peterson, my associate sports edi-
tor and I were less than subdued. 
Do you realize those marble-look-
ing blockade cylinders aren' t real-
ly concrete after all ? They bounce 
pretly well too. Suflice to say, a 
certain CSO was not too excited 
about our newfound knowledge 
and threatened to send us to Detox. 
Detox? Us!?! That 's absurd. We, 
followed by the rest of the crew, 
were off to Robertos for some 
post -party munching. With carne 
asada stuffed in our bellies, the 
night became much more manage-
able. 

When I linally sell led down to 
bed, it was past 3 a.m. Yet the 
weekend was not over - not by a 
long shot. Sleep was not in my 
future. As a die-hard sports fan , not 
even a long night of drinking can 
keep me from the televi ion . This 
night , my pajamas were my 
Manchester United jersey and my 
alarm was set for 5, a.m., two hours 
before' the start of the FA cup 
Championship match held in 
London. 

With my alarm ringing while 
my roommates were just heading 
for their beds, I arose to view my 
Red Devils meet Newcastle in one 
of England's most-r{!vered tourna-
ments. Yet. my television set was-
n't good enough. I went downtown. 

There's more people up at live 
in the morning that you would 
think . I never rise before noon on 
normal days, so it was all new to 
me. My fri end and I were heading 
to the Princess Pub in Lillie Italy 

Thursday, May 27, 1999 

- doors open at ix, game starts at 
seven. We needed to get there early 
to claim our seat in the English 
Pub, so we ponied up the $20 
entrance fee (highway robbery, but 
there was no other option) and 
immediately ordered up a couple 
pints of Guinness. Not even close 
to being sober from last night 's 
escapade, I just couldn 't stop drink-
ing. 

This was Guinness, this was 
England and we were watching 
football. There wa no soccer here. 
My buddy and I grabbed the best 
available table and eagerly watched 
pre-game as we sipped our dark 
suds. Robertos only a memory 
now, we ordered up the Full Monty 
breakfast, complete with beans and 
blood sausage. Oh it was like we 
were at Piccadilly Circus, munch-
ing on our Irish bacon and downing 
our third Guinness of the day. 

The game itself fullill ed all 
hopes. Man U. dominated from 
beginning to end, nelling a couple 
for a 2-0 victory. The English bar 
crowd roared its approval at the 
final whistle and when a cute 
female Red Devil supporter offered 
me a champagne toast , how could I 
refuse? I had two for good measure 
because my buddy was a 
Newcastle man. 

Now thoroughly inebriated, 
figured 9:30 a.m. was a good time 
to head home. Yet, the liquor store 
just kept calling our names. We 
burst in looking for Newcastle and 
Boddingtons, but ended up with 
some terrible swill they had on 
sale: Jerimiah James. I don 't know 
who concocted this awful stuff but 
Maple Syrup Stout doesn ' t even 
sound good, much less taste it. 

Suffice to say, I had a few and 
proceeded to ~a ll asleep on the sofa 
watching NASCAR. Three hours 
later, the weekend continued with 
our house heading to the communi-
ty pool for a dip and then a rousing 
tournament of ping pong. With 
paddles we procured from Sports 
Chalet, we utilized the free table as 
the batllefield for OUI war of table 
tennis. I emerged victorious, with 
my reaction time quickening every 
match as the effects of the alcohol 
slowly wore off. Another quick dip 
into the pool and it was back to the 
house for a few more cocktails. It 
was only Saturday afternoon. Even 
though I had already been down-
town twice smoozing with athletes 
and Englishmen alike, there was 
much to be done. 

Too bad I can 't remember any-
thing else. I think that Saturday 
night got a lillie out of control. 

You suck. 

Deal with it.

A Sports Weekend 
To Remember 

As one of the elder (and fat -
ter) members I' the Guardiall 
staff, I feel it 's my solemn duty 
to tell the world of the best 
weekend ever. What a weekend I 
No more sports and alcohol 
could poss ibly have heen 
packed into the two days of 
drinking and debauchery I ex pe-
rienced. So I will tell the tale ... . 

It all started Friday ni ght , the 
evening of the UCSD athletes' 
semi-formal. Despite the fact 
that I' m not rea lly an athlete, I 
was still going to he in allen-
dance thanks to an invitation 
extended to me by a foxy young 
sOt:cer girl. (The perks of bcing 
sports editor just never end !) 
My lovcly dale and I met up 
wi th other mcmbcrs of the soc-
cer team and assorted groupies 
to put down a few cocktails 
beforc this night-to-remember. 
There needed to be no dcs ignat-
ed driver. In an amazi ng show 
of fo resight , someone at UCSD 
arraig ned for shullies to the 
dance. 

This was all the hint we 
needed, as more shots were 
taken than the team took all sea-
son. 

After the necessary pre-
party, we all stumbled over to 
Peterson Hall to grab the shut-
tle. The ride to the dance was a 
story in itself. I don't know if 
these shull ie companies pick up 
any old guy from the street cor-
ner to pilot thei r vans, but let's 
just say most of us felt more 

- sober than the dri ver (which is 
rea lly say ing something). When 
we fi nally got downtown, where 
the dance was being was held on 
a boat. I felt sure the boat would 
eventually cast off, Ooati ng us 
magically off into San Diego 
Harbor. I was wrong. The boat 
stayed where it was. It didn ' t 
make much sense to me, but I'm 
sure somebody got a di count. 

Regard less of the status of 
the boat, the dance was 
absolutely fantastic. A lillle-
known fact about athletes is that 
because they are so athletic. 
they can dance reall y well. 
There was none of th is jerky 
awkwardness you see at frat for-
mals and the danci ng was prelly 
good too. Apparently, if you can 
kick, th row, hit or dribble, you 
can rea lly get your groove on 
the dance floor. It 's probably a 
good th ing the boat was docked 
because the damn th ing might 
have capsized. All those Tri ton 
physical specimens shaking 
their booties can cause quitc a 
commotion, if you know what I 
mean. 

Besides ath letes, the Liquor 
Box intramural cartel was well-
represented at the formal,

Celebrating Excellence 
Triton athletes and coaches converged en masse on the La Jolla Marriot Wednesday to honor 

their best at the Annual UCSD Athletics Recognition Night 

.By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

It 's becoming the next great tradition at 
UCSD - The UC San Diego Year In 
Review: The Athletics Recognition Night. 

Last year's gala affa ir was huge, with 
over 450 athletes, students, alumni , par-
ents, faculty and special guests in allen-
dance. This year, at least that many were at 
the La Joll a Marriot to celebrate the 
accomplishments of the UCSO athletic 
program's achievements from 1998-99. 

However, with so many remarkable 
teams here at UCSD, it 's no wonder that so 
many must allend this event. 

Triton athletes are a special breed. They 
do not receive any of the benefits that one 
would think. UCSD Tour Guides receive 
priority class regi tration, UCSO athletes 
do not. They get up early, they stay at 
school late. 

They are mi xing midterms with the love 
of their life. In other words, while the 
majority of UCSD's students are sweating 
over their studies, these athletes are taking 
the same difficult classes covered in sweat 
from thei r numerous and arduous prac-
tices. 

They ' re a special breed, and they have 
endowed UCSD with one of the most dom-
inant athletic programs in Division III hi s-
tory ; so much so that the Triton will be 

moving up to Division II permanently next 
season. 

The athletes delinitely knew that they 
were a part of something special. 

"I think something like this really rep-
resents how great UCSO athletics have 
been," UCSD men's soccer team goalkeep-
er Lucas Curtolo said. "To me, and to 
everyone else here." 

The event took on special significance 
this year because it was .the last banquet 
with Judy Sweet as UCSO's athletic direc-
tor. Sweet has been at the helm for the last 
24 years, overseeing everyone of UCSD's 
Di vision III National Championships. She 
was behind UCSD's ascension to Division 
III athletic dominance, and saw the Tritons 
claim their first Sears Oirector 's Cup last 
year as the nation's top Division III athlet-
ic program. 

The senior member of UCSO's coach-
ing fraternity, women's crew Head Coach 
Jack Vallerga, gave Sweet a moving send-
off speech. Vallerga has also been at UCSO 
for 24 year . 

Vallerga'.s emotions were further accen-
tuated by UCSO volleyball player and 
Tri ton Athletic Council member Jen 
McLain 's not-at-all surprisingly high-ener-
gy speech. In fact, McLain moti vated all of 
UCSD's athletes to create a human tunnel 
fo r Sweet, one that she charged through to 

the podiu.n to make a warm farewell 
address. 

It was obvious how moved Sweet was 
by the crowd 's display of gratitude. Her 
emotion coupled with the crowd's reaction 
showed exactly why affection like this 
makes UCSD one of most rewarding ath-
letic programs in the nation. 

Sweet began the evening with what has 
traditionally become one of the longest 
speeches of the night: the highlights of the 
past athletic season. UCSD had 14 squads 

, recei ve national recognition this season, 
including men's golf and women's volley-
ball, both of which fini shed second in the 
country, UCSO's highest team awards of 
the year. 

UCSO did have a National Champion 
this year, and it was track superstar James 
Nielsen . The sophomore long distance run-
ner earned National honors this year at the 
Division III National Championships in 
Berea, Ohio in the 5,000 meters. 

Men's water polo and men's swimming 
both earned third nationally this past sea-
son, and women's swimming garnered 
fourth -place honors. 

A for the other individual winners of 
the evening, Jenessa Bayda and Steven 
Shabel brought home the Outstanding 
Senior Student/Athlete Awards.
