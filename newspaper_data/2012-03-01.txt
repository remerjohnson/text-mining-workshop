ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN

After more than two years of hesitation, A.S. Council made UCSD history last night by vot-
ing 13-20-0 to fail the divestment 
resolution proposed by Students for 
Justice in Palestine. 

The resolution called for the UC 
system to divest, or withdraw its 
investments, from General Electric 

and Northrop 
Grumman. Both 
companies have 
contracts with the 
Israeli Defense 
Forces; they create 
the Apache heli-

copter engines and radar technol-
ogy, respectively, used by the IDF. 
SJP’s legislation, originally titled 

“Resolution in Support of UC San 
Diego Corporate Accountability 
Through Divestments From 
Corporations Profiting from Violent 
Conflict” argued that since the UC 
endowment fund — which does not 
draw from student fees or tuition 

— is not invested in companies 
supporting the Palestinian military, 
divesting from GE and Northrop 
Grumman promotes neutrality and 
corporate responsibility. But mem-
bers of Tritons for Israel stated that 
the resolution used biased language 

to specifically target Israel and cre-
ate a hostile and divisive campus 
community. 

This is the third year that SJP 
has introduced a divestment resolu-

A.S. COUNCIL    DIVESTMENT RESOLUTION     

After nearly eight hours of 
discussion, council takes a 
stance on the divestment 
resolution for the first time, 
and fails it 13-20-0.

CLICS Survey 
Question Omitted 
From Special Election
BY ANGELA CHEN
Editor in Chief

Miscommunication within A.S. Council led to a survey ques-
tion about the future of the CLICS  being omitted from the 
Division I special election ballot.  UCSD shut down CLICS, offi-
cially the Center for Library & Instructional Computing Services, 
last spring; students have been running it as a study space since 
finals week of Fall Quarter, when members of the Public Education 
Coalition “reclaimed” the area. 

PEC member Sean Estelle — who lobbied for the question to 
be included — said the survey was meant to gather student reac-
tion to university plans to use $6.7 million to turn CLICS into a 

Sun God Guest Tickets to be Sold Online

BY ANGELA CHEN
Editor in Chief

Sun God Festival guest tickets will be 
sold online for the first time, members 
of A.S. Concerts and Events announced 
at the Sun God Open Forum on Feb. 
27. In addition, students, instead of 
A.S. committees, will select the winners 
of this year’s DJ Battle and Battle of 
the Bands, Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Oliver Zhang said.

According to Festivals Coordinator 
Jennifer Tsai, the move to sell guest 
tickets online is a reaction to high 
demand. 

“It’s something we’ve wanted for 

a long time,” Zhang said, though the 
ASCE team has not determined wheth-
er guest tickets will be remain available 
through the UCSD Box Office.  

The second major change this year 
is that students will be able to vote 
on their selections to advance in each 
round of DJ Battle and Battle of the 
Bands. 

In these two events —which occur at 
the beginning of Spring Quarter — stu-
dent music groups compete to win a 
performance slot on the Main Stage or 
Dance Tent on the day of the festival.

“Previously, the people who 
advanced in the DJ Battle or Battle of 
the Bands were all selected and judged 
by a committee,” Zhang said. “We 
decided to open it up and make it more 
public and democratic.”

Students at the open forum also 
suggested ideas such as publicizing the 
food vendors at the festival and spac-

ing out the days in which tickets are 
sold. RIMAC Arena, where the festival 
is held, has a maximum capacity of 
20,000, so a maximum of 20,000 tickets 
are available, though the undergraduate 
enrollment is close to 23,000. Of the 
20,000 tickets, some are set aside for 
alumni, while 3,000 tickets are reserved 
exclusively for non-UCSD guests. 

In 2011, ASCE decreased the num-
ber of guest tickets from 3,500 to 3,000, 
and may consider limiting the amount 
further in 2012. Last year, student tick-
ets ran out on the first day they were 
available. 

Applications for the DJ Battle and 
Battle of the Band will be due on March 
24, the Saturday after Finals Week. Sun 
God Festival 2012 will be held on May 
18, the Friday of Week Seven.

Early clinical research shows 
that love can serve as an effec-
tive anti-depressant. The research 
found that an increase in oxytocin, 
sometimes referred to as the “love 
hormone,” fights chronic forms of 
depression. The brain secretes oxy-
tocin when a person experiences 
pleasant touch or other emotional 
stimuli.

This discovery is the result of 
a study launched by the UCSD 
School of Medicine in October 
2010. The study, based on prior 
scientific research that indicates 
that oxytocin has the potential to 
treat depression and other mood 
disorders, will conclude in October 
2012. The clinical trial is admin-
istered in part by UCSD Assistant 
Clinical Professor of Psychiatry Dr. 
Kai MacDonald.

This trial follows double-blind 
clinical standards. One group of 
subjects takes a twice-daily intra-
nasal dosage of 40 micrograms of 
synthetic oxytocin while another 

group receives a placebo. After one 
week, the amount is increased to 80 
micrograms and the trial continues 
for three more weeks at this dosage. 
The experimenters will discover 
which group each subject belongs 
to only after all scientific data has 
been collected and analyzed. This 
allows for the most accurate and 
unbiased conclusions.

The synthetic form of the hor-
mone is chemically identical to 
the oxytocin the body produces, 
MacDonald said. 

All patients involved in the 
study have been diagnosed with 
either major depressive disorder or 
neurotic depression, but are stable. 
Their results are measured using 
the Montgomery-Asberg scale, a 
clinician-rated depression scale 
based on 10 psychiatric inquiries, 
including the subject’s appetite, 
sleep, ability to concentrate and 
prevalence of suicidal thoughts.

Results have indicated that oxy-
tocin helps to alleviate depression-
related symptoms, indicated by a 
positive change reported in the 
patient’s health status. The clinical 

study is still recruiting participants.
The research could lead to 

change in the chemical makeup of 
existing antidepressants, or provide 
a completely different source of 
treatment for the disorder. 

“We’re doing the initial pilot 
study to see if this can either aug-
ment what people are already on, 
or treat — if they’re not on medi-
cine — depression,” MacDonald 
said.

UCSD scientists have been 
looking into the beneficial effects 
of the naturally occurring hormone 
for a couple of years now.

MacDonald and fellow UCSD 
Professor of Psychiatry Dr. David 
Feifel have also researched the 
effects of oxytocin on anxiety dis-
orders in 2010, and on schizophre-
nia in 2011. According to their 
research, oxytocin functions as an 
anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety 
agent.

“This is the third in an inesti-
mably long list of trials; the oxyto-
cin system is a natural endogenous

PA I D  A D V E R T I S E M E N T

Wednesday’s A.S. meeting featured the discussion and vote on the 
resolution to 
divest from GE 
and Northrop 
Grumman. The 
Price Center 
Forum was 
completely full, 
with at least 
80 students 
inside and 
some overflowing into the hallway.  
Security was also present throughout 
the meeting.    
     Approximately 25 students, 
professors and non-faculty 
employees spoke against A.S. 
Council voting on the divestment 
proposal, and over 20 students also 
addressed council in support of the 
proposal. 
     Public input lasted nearly three 
hours, and constituents were 
disappointed when the speakers list 
closed. 
      “Whoever moved to close the 
speaker’s list, shame on you,” former 
AVP of Student Organizations 
Lynne Swerhone said, “You owe the 
students who came all the way here 
the opportunity to speak.” 
      During these serious comments 
from members of the public, 
somehow the speakers in the forum 
began broadcasting the “Vagina 
Monologues” rehearsal in the Loft. 
Everyone found it odd hearing a 
random “Oh my god, vaginas!” 
during public comment. It didn’t 
exactly lighten the mood. 
      A special presentation regarding 
the Galbraith Hall renovations 
followed public input. Associate 
Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey 
and Director of Space Planning 

Tom Allen gave a presentation 
highlighting how alterations to other 
areas, such as Revelle College and 

Geisel Library’s 
study spaces, 
will create 266 
more seats than 
was available 
before CLICS 
closed. 
       Renovating 
Galbraith Hall 
will cost about 

$6.7 million, which is less than half 
of what constructing a new building 
would cost, Sawrey said. The money 
for this renovation will not come 
from student fees, tuition or state 
grants.  
     “The funding [for Galbraith Hall] 
is coming from discretionary funds,” 
Sawrey said. “These are one-time 
funds that cannot be replenished 
once they are spent, so they cannot 
be used for ongoing operations for 
something like a library.” 
       Sawrey also emphasized the 
growing need for more large 
classrooms at UCSD, since the 
current large classrooms are being 
used every weekday from the time 
they open to the time they close. 
       There are currently only four 
classrooms that hold 300 students or 
more, and only three that can hold 
200  to 300 students. 
       Members of the Public 
Education Coalition expressed their 
desire for CLICS construction to be 
postponed until a later date. Sawrey 
said that she did not have control 
over this, but would try to advocate 
on this behalf.  
      A special presentation from 
Tritons for Israel followed the 
presentation by the Building 
Advisory Committee for Galbraith 
Hall.

“When students spend an hour 

of an A.S. meeting lobbying for that 
question to be put on a referendum, 
and A.S. can’t fulfill their duty, maybe 
there needs to be another check and 
balance,” Estelle said.

Advocate General Courtney Hill 
said that council approved the survey 
question to appear on the special elec-
tion ballot. But when she forwarded 
this information to A.S. Programmer 
Johnny Kent, she neglected to specify 
which ballot the question should be 
included on, as there will also be 
a general election ballot in Spring 
Quarter.

“When the final draft of the ballot 

came for review, I was so concerned 
with correctness in the [Division-I] 
referendum language that the survey 
completely slipped my mind,” Hill 
said. “Council’s been taking a lot of 
heat for it, but it has nothing to do 
with them; I take personal respon-
sibility.”

Hill is working on sending the sur-
vey question out via campus listserv. 
The question will still be included on 
the general election ballot in April, 
but student input will be negligible by 
then, Estelle said.

“General election voting occurs 
in early April, while the deadline for 
construction bids for CLICS is March 
13,” Estelle said. “It’s commendable 
that Courtney is doing her best to 
react, but I wish that more could be 

done as student input won’t matter 
by then.”

A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
emphasized that the omission was an 
honest mistake. 

“I sponsored that survey question 
myself, and wanted it included on the 
special election ballot,” she said. “I 
was as shocked as anyone else that it 
was omitted.”

The special election — which asks 
students to vote on whether they are 
willing to pay an additional $495 
annually to move to Division I athlet-
ics — began Monday, Feb. 27, and will 
last until Friday, March 9. Students 
can vote on TritonLink.

system in your brain like the serotonin 
and dopamine systems,” MacDonald 
said. “There are all kinds of conditions 
that could theoretically benefit. We’re 
just picking off the most likely candi-
dates, but there are many more.”

Common anti-depressants use 
serotonin to initiate changes in brain 
chemistry, which can alleviate depres-
sion. Oxytocin directly interacts with 
the dopamine and serotonin systems, 
both of which affect depression and its 
symptoms, MacDonald said. 

“One possible hypothesis about 
how oxytocin may help depression is 
interaction with other brain systems 
that we know influence depression,” 
MacDonald said.

Council Indefinitely Tables 
Proposed $13 Fee Increase
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

A.S. Council has indefinitely tabled a referendum for a $13 quarterly 
increase proposed by the University Centers Advisory Board. 

A.S. President Alyssa Wing wrote an email to the council listserv on Feb. 
29 announcing that the referendum’s sponsors will not pursue the legislation 
this year.

“They [AVC of Student Affairs and the Chair and Vice-Chair of UCAB] 
have decided to discontinue their efforts to pursue putting the referendum 
on the spring ballot, and thus, will be asking council to table C1 indefinitely,” 
Wing wrote. “While we will not be discussing the referendum today, the 
referendum will most certainly appear again for council approval in the 
near future.”

The proposed referendum would increase the University Centers fees 
from $76.50 to $89.50 per quarter to support Price Center, the Student 
Center and Che Café.

According to a Feb. 13 Guardian article, the funding from the increase 
would go toward maintenance and repairs to University Centers, and help 
Price Center remain open 24 hours a day Sunday through Thursday. A 2010 
estimate by ISES Corporation puts the total cost of repairs and essential 
maintenance at around $6.4 million. The fee increase is estimated to fund 
an additional $20 million of services over 20 years.

President, Tritons for Israel

Does the resolution target Israel?
Proponents of the resolution claim the resolution does not target 

Israel, and consequently does not alienate Israeli or pro-Israel students 
on campus. 

When looking at the text of the resolution, however, Israel is the only 
country mentioned, and singled out for collective punishment. Even 
though both companies specified in the resolution, General Electric and 
Northrop Grumman, have military contracts with over a dozen other 
countries, including the United States, Great Britain, Japan and Taiwan, 
the only country mentioned is the State of Israel. 

The resolution could achieve the same goals without targeting Israel, 
but intentionally singles out the only democracy in the Middle East. If 
the resolution passes, global organizations such as Boycott, Divestment 
and Sanctioning of Israel will claim this as a huge victory. 
Will the resolution divide this campus and alienate students?

The resolution does not foster a more cohesive campus community, 

Divestment Targets Jewish and Pro-Israel Community,

Wrong to Invest in Companies That Profit off  
Violence — the Resolution Advocates for Neutrality
BY MERYEM KAMIL
Students for Justice in Palestine

What is divestment? 
     Divestment refers to taking out current investments from a company, in 
our case for ethical reasons. 
Why UCSD? 
      This resolution seeks to continue the university’s push for corporate 
responsibility by advocating for social sustainability. We, as socially-
conscious UCSD students, are fundamentally against our institution’s 
support of a company that profits off of violence. 
Why does the proposed resolution target GE and Northrop Grumman? 
     Both companies produce parts of Apache helicopters used by the Israeli 
Defense Forces against Palestinians, documented by Amnesty International. 
Why this conflict? 
     As an organization that specializes in the region, it is only logical that 
SJP would focus on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Additionally, the conflict 
gives context to the detrimental business practices of GE and Northrop 
Grumman. 

REDEFINING ROLES

GUEST COMMENTARIES

It’s going to be a tough few weeks for our student leaders. Yesterday night, the Forum where A.S. Council meets was packed with students. There were 
students in favor of the Division-I athletic 
referendum, and students against. There 
were students in favor of the UC system 
pulling money from weapons manufacturers 
contracted with the Israeli Defense Forces, and 
there were students just as passionately against 
this divestment. All of them seemed to have 
differing ideas of what A.S. Council is, what 
A.S. Council could be and what A.S. Council 
should be, and the worst part is, the council 
itself couldn’t quite decide either. Our student 
government works with millions in student 
fees, and wields very quantifiable power — but 
in order to be truly effective, its members must 
clearly define their own roles and consistently 
adhere to these guidelines. 

These issues of Division I and 
divestment put council in a tricky spot. The 
ongoing Division I special election places 
councilmembers at the center of a debate over 
neutrality, and whether a group of twenty-
somethings elected by less than one-third of 
the population can fairly represent 23,000 
undergraduates, and deal with over $2 million 
in student fees. At the same time, students on 
both sides of the divestment debate clearly 
believe that council has the power to represent 
the campus globally, and asks whether this 
same group of twenty-somethings should 
weigh in on issues as complicated as Middle 
Eastern politics when the decisions could 
brand UCSD for a long time to come. 

Let’s start with the Division I referendum, 
which students will be voting on until March 
9. Aside from the arguments for and against 
the referendum itself, the election has brought 
A.S. Council to the forefront of student 
consciousness, and raised questions about its 
role as a representative body. 

Division I is the change that everyone 
wants to see, but not everyone wants to pay 
for. Council as a whole has been charged with 
being a neutral body running both pro and 
con campaigns, but A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
— along with other members — have publicly 
supported the pro side, albeit claiming that it’s 
purely in their capacity as students, and not as 
members of council. Posts on Facebook groups 
such as the UCSD Students Against the D-I 

Referendum have criticized Wing for this lack 
of neutrality. 

Yet it’s a politician’s job to lobby for what 
she believes in — a job which doesn’t simply 
turn on and off at will; it begins as soon 
as one is elected and only ends when the 
term does. It’s then ludicrous for students to 
attack a politician for personally trying to 
fulfill campaign promises, and it’s ludicrous 

for politicians to argue that there can be a 
separation between their personal views and 
their job. When Wing ran for A.S. President in 
Spring 2011, football and the move to Division 
I were key components of her campaign. Her 
platform swept the elections with a 854 vote 
margin; in fact, only three of the slate’s 30 
candidates did not make it into office and their 
efforts to pass the referendum are — regardless 
of personal views toward the fee increase — an 
admirable example of serving the people who 
voted them into office. 

But this sweep of the council seats is, 
in large part, the root cause of the cries of 
impartiality and corruption. Of course council 
should always try to show the other side, 
but with the majority of the council united 
on the issue, the members may, perhaps 
unintentionally, present biased information. 
The problem is that only 27.5 percent of UCSD 
voted Wing into office, so a single-slate council 
has enormous control over issues affecting 
the entire student body — even though so few 
people definitively supported their stances. 

This highlights the importance of general 
elections (which will take place in April). 
Politicians are voted into office based on their 
campaign promises. Students unhappy with 
promises — or whose preferred candidates 
weren’t voted in — clearly have the right to 
have their voices heard, but they should focus 
on protesting the changes, not the neutrality of 
the people in office (unless there are examples 
of intentional misinformation and attempts 
to censor the opposition). But unfortunately, 
the only true way to ensure a multi-faceted 
council is to encourage students to vote and 
get informed about the issues, so peers with 
their values are voted into office, and council 
has more students who provide dissenting 
information and views.

See A.S. COUNCIL, page 5

There aren’t many socially acceptable opportunities for college students to day-drink 
their way into a stupor before it’s 5 
o’clock somewhere. The best examples 
include Sun God, your birthday, your 
roommate’s birthday, a hungover 
morning and most important and 
timely of all, St. Patrick’s Day. 

It’s a time when, to quote “Stuff 
White People Say,” a full 100 percent 
of white people claim that they are 
somewhat Irish. This gives Irishmen, 
and friends of supposed Irishmen — 

in this case, everybody — a reason to 
wake up early and consume an Irish 
car bomb before class. And if you 
let the drink curdle before chugging 
it fast enough, it’s almost like a 
milkshake. Delicioso. 

But in your pre-rivalry planning 
for this year, you might’ve taken a 
look at the calendar and realized to 
your horror, that March 17 lands on 
a Saturday the weekend before finals. 
And because we are, after all, a strong 
academic school and because we do, 
after all, spend the majority of finals 
week inside of the library, surrounded 
by Sour Patch Kids wrappers and 
the stench of sweat and desperation, 
March 17 might not seem like the 
best time to party with Molly Malone. 
But think again. Embrace your 
(maybe) fake Irish roots by following 
How-to Guru’s advice.

Depending on your tolerance, 
decide how to stagger your drinks 
in advance. Whether it is one bottle 
of Guinness an hour or a full-blown 
drunken encounter with a bottle 
of Glenfiddich at midnight, plan 
according to your study schedule and 
your alcohol tolerance. 

You’re probably tired of studying 
already, but take a little time out of 
your day and read up on the history 
of Irish-English conflict. Look up 
key words like Ulster and Bloody 
Sunday, as well as revolutionaries 
like Daniel O’Connell and Thomas 
Francis Meagher. Fueled by this 
information, you will be able to 
inform your friends on the history of 
Irish oppression. 

Or better yet, look up the history 
of the patron saint himself — Saint 
Patrick. The most celebrated and 
widely recognized patron saint of 
Ireland, in and out of the Emerald 
Isles, Saint Patrick’s day is celebrated 
on the day of his death, March 17. 
Fun fact: Saint Patrick was once 
a resident of Wales, until he was 
captured by Irish raiders and enslaved 
for six years. After being freed, he 
entered the Irish church and helped 
bring Catholicism to the children of 
Erin. These days, drunken Americans 
remember him as a reason to wear 
green and shout “Sláinte!” (cheers) 
while downing a pint. 

Whether you spend the whole 
day drinking or embracing your 
Irish roots, or both, enjoy it. It may 
seem overly commercialized and 
stereotypical to the point of being 
trite, but before these thoughts 
infiltrate your thoughts, take a swig of 
whiskey instead. Sláinte!

The next few weeks will be a trying time for A.S. Council as debate rages about 
Division I and divestment — which makes this an opportunity for council to redefine 

its role as student body representatives.

Council as a whole should strive to represent the 
population of UCSD — and the way to do that is to 
ensure that the positions are filled with people of 
different viewpoints, who work to fight for the values of 
the people who voted them in office, whether it is the 
Muir population, the activist population or the Greek 
population. Obviously, council is most effective when 
the majority of its members are from the same slate and 
can work together toward a shared goal. As the 2010-11 
council under then-A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
showed, a highly divided council can results in tense and 
disagreeable interactions. 

Still, a council is most representative when it is 
comprised of diverse opinions. And with a voting rate as 

low as 27 percent, diversity in representation is crucial. 
This will make for healthy debate in council — having 
many points of information supported by many different 
members is more effective than a council where each 
member tries to be “neutral” despite the issues they said 
they would stand for.

The next big question plaguing council is one of its 
own agency. This is the third year in a row that Students 
for Justice in Palestine has introduced the annual 
“divestment resolution.” The resolution urges council 
to pressure the UC Regents to pull its endowment fund 
money from General Electric and Northrop Grumman. 
These companies supply Apache helicopter parts and 
radar technology to the Israeli military. SJP said that,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor, 
Today in our meeting, the 

Interfraternity Council discussed 
the Division-I referendum. As a 
result of that meeting, I would like 
to issue the following statement:

It brings me great pleasure to 
announce that the gentlemen of the 
Interfraternity Council endorse YES 
on the Division-I referendum.  As a 
community, we collectively believe 
that this move is an investment 
in the future of an already world-
renowned university.  Many for 
and against this move to Division 
I compare us to other universities, 
however we challenge them to 
bring the focus back to UCSD. We 
are only 50 years young and have 
already accomplished so much; our 
potential is limitless.

To our Triton athletes, know that 
we support you 100%. You make us 
proud every day, and now it is our 
turn to reciprocate.

Free Trade Agreement 
Passed Unexpectedly

  
Dear Editor,

There was a huge yacht in San 
Diego Bay that I saw this morning 
as I rode the ferry to Coronado.  
My thought was, if that ship was 
atomized while I was looking, would 
I call 911 on my cellphone?

I once bought a signed 
paperback copy of Pablo Neruda’s 
collected poems in the Grove 
edition that had been given to 
the University of Hawaii Library 
by Leon Edel. I took it with me 

just as the retreating forces of the 
Chinese KMT under Chiang Kai-
shek took the Palace Museum with 
them to Taipei. Back at UCSD 
I attended a talk given by the 
President of Chile.  I told him at 
the reception that I was returning 
the next day to South Korea, 
and I didn’t think the Free Trade 
agreement between his country and 
that country would pass the ROK 
legislature.  He told me to stop at 
the Chilean Embassy in Seoul and 
to tell his ambassador to make sure 
that it did pass.  I arrived at Incheon 
International Airport on Sunday, 
and I went to the Embassy.  The 
consul general saw me through the 
glass partition, and said, “Cerrado, 
señor.” and then, “We’re closed, 
sir.”  I held up the frontispiece of 
the book (Neruda always signed 
in green ink).  He opened the 
door.  “How may I help you?” he 
asked.  I replied that his president 
had sent me and that I wanted 
the ambassador to have the book, 
and would he accept it? “No,” he 
said.  “No?” I asked incredulously.  
Where do you teach?  Suwon?  My 
ambassador will come to your 
university on Wednesday morning 
and he will accept it from you 
formally then. The book ended up 
on display at the national legislature 
building after the FTA had passed.

UC System to 
Partner with 
YouTube on 
UCTVPrime
BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

The University of California and YouTube have 
created UCTVPrime, a new YouTube channel that 
will feature original documentaries. The channel, 
which launches today, March 1, is the first part-
nership between YouTube and a university.

UCTV is a statewide television channel that 
airs UC content. Since UCSD is the only campus 
with its own television channel (UCSD-TV) and 
facilities, UCTV is based on the La Jolla campus.

UCTV Communication Director Allison Gang 
said that this initiative uses YouTube’s new origi-
nal channel format, which funds Web-exclusive 
content. 

“The university has three missions: teaching, 
research and public service,” Gang said. “UCSD-
TV and UCTV have always been positioned as 
one of the public services that the university does.”  

Gang told the Daily Bruin in a Feb. 23 article 
that YouTube granted an initial $300,000 to UCTV 
to create mini-series and short documentaries. 

“The idea is that YouTube, over the course of 
the year will recoup its investment in these pro-
grams through advertising,” Gang said. “If enough 
revenue comes in, then YouTube would share 
revenue with UCTV, which would be used to fund 
the infrastructure of the network.”

The university will use the grant money to 
fund documentaries. UCTV expects to air up to 
15 minutes of original content each week, begin-
ning with a four-part mini-series called “Naked 
Art.” 

The documentary, which will air March 1, will 
explore the UC system’s public art collections. 

“UCTV has had a YouTube channel since 2006, 
but has basically replicated what has been aired 
on UCTV,” Gang said. ”It has just been a place to 
archive our videos.”

tion to council. In 2010, the A.S. Campus 
Affairs Committee voted 7-8 to table the 
measure indefinitely. In 2011, council voted 
13-10-4 to postpone voting on divestment 
until members of SJP and Tritons for Israel 
could produce a joint resolution agreeable to 
both sides. The two groups were unable to 
do so. Both years, council ultimately tabled 
the resolution without taking a stance. As 
of the Feb. 29 decision, UCSD is the second 

UC campus 
to fail the 
r e s o l u t i o n . 
In 2010, UC 
B e r k e l e y ’s 
t h e n - A . S . 
P r e s i d e n t 
Will Smelko 
vetoed a sim-
ilar divest-
ment reso-
lution after 
it passed 
in Berkeley 
S e n a t e . 
A c c o r d i n g 
to a Daily 
C al i for nian 
article dated 
April 16, 
2010, the 
Senate was 
unable to 
garner the 
2/3 majority 

required to overturn Smelko’s veto.
SJP members said that the resolution did 

not ask council to solve or take a side in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“Currently, our university is taking a 
stand, a stand toward Israel, and that stance 
and the status quo is alienating for students 
—  who identify as Arab or pro-Palestinian 
in general — who don’t believe we should 
be funding this conflict,” SJP member Amal 
Dalmar said. “If people feel that this reso-
lution is, in any way, anti-Semitic, that’s 
just preposterous. There’s nothing in this 
resolution that in any way, shape or form 

suggests that we are doing anything more 
than divesting from these specific corpora-
tions, which have been linked directly to 
this conflict.”

Dalmar, along with SJP President Nadia 
Abu-Gheida, said that past council decisions 
such as divestment from South African 
apartheid set precedent for student gov-
ernment to vote on issues of foreign poli-
cy. In November 2011, council passed the 
“Resolution in Support of Reclaim UCSD.” 
This stated that ASUCSD can make deci-
sions regarding “world events and political 
issues that deeply impact UCSD students 
and are significant to their student lives.” 

“We’re not asking council to make a 
decision, or find a solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict,” Abu-Gheida said. 
“We’re asking you to make a decision on 
the resolution in favor of neutrality so that 
neither side is funded, and we’ve provided 

enough information for that, and the prec-
edent is set so that A.S. can deal with these 
issues. This campus is already divided, but 
this resolution is not divisive and the con-
flict is not something that will go away if 
council votes ‘no.’”

But Tritons for Israel President Daniel 
Friedman said that the “Resolution in 
Support of Reclaim UCSD” was only appli-
cable to clear-cut and non-divisive issues, 
and that council passing the divestment res-
olution would violate its mission statement 
to promote a cohesive and unified campus. 

“I don’t think the intent of the resolution 
is to be anti-Semitic,” Friedman said. ”But 
the consequence is that Jewish students feel 
targeted, and Jewish students don’t feel as 
safe or comfortable on campus, and that 
has anti-Semitic consequences. So is it anti-
Semitic? Yes and no, and if it passes, it will

shut down important dialogue.”
He added that the UC system 

invests in other companies linked to 
conflict, but the resolution language, 
despite being a blanket condemna-
tion of such investments, targeted 
GE and Northrop Grumann because 
of their involvement with Israel. 
This is an example of holding Israel 
to a double standard, Friedman said. 

Yesterday night’s council meet-
ing began with nearly three hours of 
public input, including passionate 
arguments from both sides. 

“I am unsafe on this cam-
pus when there is talk of divest-
ment,” Muir College sophomore 
Shani Arbiv said. “I didn’t apply to 
Berkeley or Irvine because of the 
problems they have, with Jewish 
students feeling scared to go there. 
When I’m tabling on Admit Day 
and one of the questions I get is, 
‘What is it like for Jewish students 
on campus? Is there anti-Semitism?’ 
It’s really hard to tell people ‘no’, and 
by voting ‘yes’ you are making the 
campus very hostile for students 
who go here.”

But Students for Justice in 
Palestine member Samera Yousuf 
said that the resolution had no anti-
Semitic intent and asked only for 
the UC system to refuse to profit off 
human rights violations.

   “For those who feel alienated, 
I understand that —  as an Afghan 
Muslim, I feel alienated by U.S. for-
eign policy every single day,” she 
said. “If this resolution in support of 
neutrality from the violence in the 
Israeli-Palestinian territory is not 
voted ‘yes’ on, I would feel scared 
that my representatives are in sup-
port of violent conflict.”

After public input, Friedman and 
TFI member Ben Hass gave a spe-
cial presentation arguing that the 
resolution targeted Israel — and 
by extension, the Jewish and pro-

Israel campus community — unfair-
ly. Friedman and Hass added that, 
if passed, the resolution would be 
claimed as a victory by the Boycott 
Divest Sanctions movement, a polit-
ical group created by Palestinian 
NGOs. 

During debate, councilmembers 
revised the original language of the 
referendum went twice. 

Associate Vice President of 
College Affairs Leonard Bobbitt 
added an amendment to the reso-
lution stating that it was not in 
support of the BDS movement. He 

also called for the language to spe-
cifically state that the UC system, 
in the future, should avoid invest-
ing in countries associated with 
the Palestinian military as well to 
ensure full neutrality.

The second round of revisions, 
spearheaded by Muir College 
Senator Leah Wong, changed the 
title of the resolution to include 
specific mention of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. 

Wong said that she asked for this 
change to clarify the exact nature 
of the resolution, which she said 

was clearly not a call for divestment 
from all corporations profiting from 
violent conflict, but instead centered 
on the Middle East. Council passed 
both amendments.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing said 
that she believed the resolution had 
no place in council and urged mem-
bers to vote ‘no.’

“This evening, for the third year 
in a row, it is proven to me that 
this resolution 
does not belong 
in the Associated 
Students,” she said. 
“It is undeniable 
that this resolution 
causes divisive-
ness, and we will 
destroy our cam-
pus community 
with this resolu-
tion.”

Shortly before 
1 a.m., the council 
took an open roll 
call vote. The reso-
lution failed with 
13 “yes” votes, 20 
“no” votes and zero 
abstentions. 

“[The resolution 
failing] is not the 
end of dialogue, it 
is the beginning of a valuable oppor-
tunity that we need to really take 
advantage of, and use to help bridge 
communities,” Friedman said.

Vice President of External 
Affairs Samer Naji, who sponsored 
the resolution, said that the impact 
of the resolution failing affected 
more students than solely the mem-
bers of SJP.

“I think that the council let down 
every member of every org that 
supported the resolution,” Naji said. 
Organizations that have publicly 
supported the resolution include 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, Student Sustainability 

Collective, Students for Civil Rights 
in Iran and the Public Education 
Coalition.

SJP member Meryem Kamil said 
that much of the dialogue during 
the council meeting was problem-
atic. 

“I’m extremely disappointed in 
the outcome, and not only am I dis-
appointed, I’m very hurt by it,” Kamil 
said. “There has been intimidation 

of councilmembers 
and there has been 
explicit pressure put 
onto councilmembers 
to vote no. [...] And 
honestly, after seven 
hours of being in this 
room, I might’ve even 
voted ‘no.’ I think that 
the debates were not 
productive, and the 
folks conducting these 
debates knew that it 
would not be produc-
tive.”

According to the  
A.S. Bylaws, failed 
resolutions can be 
brought back before 
council as early as the 
next meeting.

Members of both 
Students for Justice in 

Palestine and Tritons for Israel have 
stated that — though they will con-
tinue to engage in dialogue — the two 
groups have mutually exclusive inter-
ests when it comes to divestment. 

Friedman said he hopes that, if the 
divestment resolution is reintroduced 
next year, Tritons for Israel would 
continue to oppose it. 

Kamil and Abu-Gheida said that 
SJP will reintroduce the legislation 
next year.

THE TENTH ANNUAL

ANTI-
OSCARS

W hat’s fascinating about groundbreak-ing music is how it seems to oper-ate on two separate levels: a novel 
form of expression on the one hand, and 
radio-friendly quirk on the other. Much of 

Pink Floyd’s devastating storytelling and 
nuanced instrumentation has been lost 
upon Hot Topic merch and the Zunes of 
high school faux-stoners with facial hair. 
And you could cite any one of the Beatles’ 
iconic personae without having reveled 
in the existential folk tale that is “Rocky 
Raccoon” or discovering just how strange a 
place Penny Lane really is. 

But the undeniable masters of art-as-
pop are the Beach Boys. With the looks of 
a dweeby, all-male Brady Bunch and a sim-
plistic attitude toward beach culture that 
made any real surfer scoff, surely it was 
easy to forget that they were making some 
of the most innovative music of the time. 

In the early ’60s, Van Dyke Parks was 
one of these scoffing surfers. This was 
when, at age 24, he was already busy sprin-
kling his signature off-kilter arrangements 
on Disney’s “The Jungle Book.” But that 
was before he met Brian Wilson in 1966. 
That was before he reinvented and then 
broke up the Beach Boys (it’s still a wonder 
Parks hasn’t received as much unwar-
ranted shit from fans as Yoko Ono did in 
1970). And that was long before he earned 
a legacy that has still, for whatever reason, 
remained one of American music’s best-
kept secrets. 

When the long-awaited SMiLE Sessions 
were finally released last year, Beach Boy 
fans marveled at out how such an enor-
mously influential blend of contemporary 
psychedelia, heartfelt songwriting and 
Americana runoff could go 45 years with-
out seeing the light of a proper production. 

The problem is, it didn’t. A year after 
SMiLE’s colossal undoing, Van Dyke Parks 
went to work synthesizing the sound and 
lyricism he leant to Wilson with a remark-
able, genre-defying solo debut. Parks’ 1967 
now-cult classic Song Cycle is a creative 
whirlwind like no other — an album with 
the scope of Sgt. Peppers, the structure of 
an experimental jazz record and the arse-
nal of a Busby Berkeley film. It also had  
terribly disappointing sales upon release, 
failing to approach the record-breaking 
$35,000 spent making it. 

But what makes Van Dyke Parks’ invis-
ibility truly perplexing is the fact that he’s 
still at work. Five years after Song Cycle, 
Parks’ released the spectacular Discover 
America — a Hollywood-meets-Trinidad 
pop epic that mastered the art of “sam-
pling” from the public domain a decade 
before the birth of hip-hop. In 2006, Parks 
contributed his stunning arrangements to 
Joanna Newsom’s Ys — a work that I’ll go 
ahead and call one of the greatest albums 
of the decade, but that frightened away 
potential listeners with its dense storybook 
of a lyric sheet and 15-plus minute songs.

But Parks was most likely never 
destined for mainstream acceptance. 
While the Talking Heads and Velvet 
Undergrounds of the past have buried 
artistic revelation under radio play, Parks 
has walked the exact opposite career path 
— his universal classics hidden in the 
shadowy corners of underground obscu-
rity. It’s a shame for the casual music lover, 
but an immensely satisfying treasure for 
those of us willing to dig.

BEST PORTRAYAL OF A 
FAMOUS FIGURE

W hat’s left to say about “The Muppets” that hasn’t yet been said? Yes, Jason Segel’s script and star-ring role provided our nostalgic felt friends with 
a fresh new presence. Yes, Chris Cooper played a villainous 
oil tycoon who literally said “diabolical laugh” each time his 
wicked scheming paid off. Yes, there was a musical sequence 
penned by Flight of the Conchords’ Brett McKenzie entitled 
“Man or Muppet” and hell yes, you better believe it was 
righteous.

But “The Muppet”’s true achievement — the one the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences so predict-
ably forgot to acknowledge this year — is that it was com-
pletely devoid of crude cheap laughs and utterly stupid pop-
culture harvesting, delivering instead a purely joyful, wildly 
entertaining, get-up-and-dance family film for the ages.

HIATUS EDITOR

W hen Ryan Gosling historically secured the prestigious honor of Best Kiss at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards for his famous grabbing-
Rachel-McAdams-by-the-throat-in-the-rain scene, no 
one could’ve possibly dreamt that the baby-faced badass 
would strike again quite as deeply or effectively. But this 
year, the instant classic elevator sequence of the ultra-
stylish “Drive” provided moviegoers with a life-affirming 
“Yes he can!”

Shot in elegant slo-mo, complete with shifting 
extradiegetic lighting, Gosling moves from the man he 
knows to be his predator, taking his fragile Denny’s wait-
ress by the hip and embracing her in a kiss that seems to 
freeze time and dispel the imminent threat that stands 
just a few feet away. Then, of course, Gosling proceeds 
to bash the thug’s head right in. It’s the kind of timeless 
moment of pulp violence and beauty that can only exist 
on the screen.

HIATUS EDITOR

S ince coming up with origi-nal characters is no fun in Hollywood, every year there’s 
a stream of portrayals of famous 
figures, each more pretentious than 
the last. 

Last year was no exception. There 
was Leonardo DiCaprio furrow-
ing his eyebrows as FBI director J. 
Edgar Hoover (“J. Edgar”), Michelle 
Williams taking on Hollywood’s 
most famous blonde (“My Week 
With Marilyn”) and, of course, 
Meryl Streep’s Oscar-winning por-
trayal of Margaret Thatcher (“The 
Iron Lady”) — all compelling per-
formances in typical biopic fashion: 
melodramatic and heavily make-up-
reliant.

Leave it to Woody Allen to some-
how have the most famous faces 
with the least amount of over-acting. 
His surprise summer hit “Midnight 
In Paris” had Owen Wilson shoot-
ing the shit with Ernest Hemingway, 
the Fitzgeralds and Gertrude Stein, 

among other literary/art figures of 
the 1920s.

But rather than have another 
ultra-famous actor attempt to 
explore the psyche of someone we 
can never really understand, Allen’s 
film instead plays off the romantic 
notions we have of the historical 
characters (Hemingway’s masculine 
stoicism, Zelda Fitzgerald’s mania) 
to chuckle-worthy effect. 

Enter the best of ’em all: Adrien 
Brody’s cameo as Salvador Dali. In 
over-the-top mustachioed glory, the 
actor was delightfully kooky, ram-
bling about seeing a rhinoceros and 
squinting at Owen Wilson in perfect, 
surrealist thought. Admittedly, the 
performance is a total caricature, but 
it’s all in good fun — and it’s one of 
the most memorable moments of 
last year’s most charming film with-
out puppets.

More of the Hiatus Take On the Best and Worst of Film in 2011
▶ ANTI-OSCARS from page 8

“X-MEN: FIRST CLASS”
BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE

L et’s face it — Summer 2011 was an endless stream of superhero movies, with all of the bluster-
ing special effects and awkward outfits 
that go with a Captain America song 
and dance. But not all superhero 
movies (or superheroes) are made 
equal. In this summer’s case, more 
superheroes are better than just one 
— “X-Men: First Class” was clearly the 
best of the bunch. 

The story traveled to the past, to 
the formation of the original X-men 

team, replete with members who only 
real comic book buffs would recog-
nize (Darwin, really?). 

Apparently, during the Cold War, 
Professor X had hair and could walk, 
Magneto was James Bond-dreamy 
and Wolverine was just as badass as 
usual. Oh, and Emma Frost was still a 
terribly acted ice queen. Some things 
never change.

“THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO”
BEST REMAKE

G iven recent high-budget American adaptations of international films (see 
“Let Me In,” based on the Swedish 
“Let the Right One In,” and that 
classic of laughably unnecessary 
remakes, “Dark Water”), you might 
be forgiven for assuming that David 
Fincher’s “The Girl with the Dragon 
Tattoo” would prove to be an unin-
spired, over-stylized mess. 

You’d be wrong though: 
Somehow, Fincher’s “Dragon 
Tattoo,” in addition to faithfully 
adapting Stieg Larsson’s power-
ful story to the screen, manages to 
build on that story, carefully har-
nessing its astronomical budget ($90 
million compared to the Swedish 
version’s $13 million) to augment 
the original film’s stark portrayal 
of the Swedish novel. Through 

its gorgeously aesthetic cinema-
tography, lean narrative pace and 
a fittingly chilling score by Trent 
Reznor, David Fincher’s “Girl with 
the Dragon Tattoo” not only mea-
sures up to its Swedish predecessor, 
it surpasses it entirely, a rare feat for 
major American cinema.

“CONTAGION”
BEST DEATH BY GWYNETH

W hat Gwyneth Paltrow lends to any movie isn’t her blonde, ponytailed 
spunk or even her country strong 
singing voice — it’s the countless 
ways she can die. From having her 
head cut off and sent as a gift to her 
film husband Brad Pitt in “Se7en” 
(1995) to voluntarily placing her 
head in an oven as classic writer 
Sylvia Plath in “Sylvia” (2003), there 
is no shortage of ways that the 
actress can die. 

But Paltrow’s most recent movie 
death takes the cake — in disease 
thriller “Contagion,” Paltrow gasps 

her final breath in the opening 
sequence of the film. With her ter-
ror-filled eyes and sickly pale skin, 
Paltrow has never looked better.

Herein lies the tricky question: 
Is it a better movie when Gwyneth 
Paltrow dies in the beginning or 
the end? As “Contagion” proved, it’s 
clearly better to have her out of the 
way in the beginning — she gets the 
film credit but disappears and makes 
away for better actors like Matt 
Damon and Kate Winslet.

MANAGING EDITOR

“SHAME”
THE ‘WAIT, THIS FILM EXISTED?’ AWARD

S teve McQueen’s “Shame” certainly didn’t fall short of any expectations, mostly because after the hoopla over Michael Fassbender’s full fron-
tal nudity, nobody seemed to care.  During major 
film festival season, “Shame” received some buzz for 
Fassbender’s outstanding performance as a NYC sex 
addict, but the film was soon forgotten by the Academy 
Awards and audiences alike.

It’s as if no one had the balls to approach this film 
and its graphic content (aka, actual balls). Perhaps peo-
ple were too self conscious to sit in a theatre with others 
and feast their eyes on this heartfelt adult film (and did 
we mention Fassbender’s genitalia?). What a shame.

ALBUM REVIEWS

L ast year, classically-trained Los Angeles experimental song-stress Julia Holter released 
Tragedy, a dense collection of lilt-
ing, mildly unsettling drone-pop. 
Tragedy’s eight lengthy composi-
tions, based on Euripides’ play 
“Hippolytus,” effortlessly transitioned 
between skewed synth-pop, drone 
and almost neoclassical vocal layer-

ing.
On Ekstasis, Holter manages to 

retain Tragedy’s complex compositional 
structure while allowing the songs a 
sense of pop-friendliness that was until 
now absent in her work. The results 
are phenomenal: Like its predecessor, 
Ekstasis is an enveloping, fascinating 
album, one which exists entirely within 
its own self-contained aesthetic sphere.

Opener “Marienbad” finds Holter 
in familiar territory, coupling elabo-
rate layers of hymn-like vocals with 
a meandering harpsichord. Halfway 
through the song, however, steady 
4/4 beat emerges, leading the song 
into sonic territory equally indebted 
to Steve Reich and UK house music. 
That’s right, on Ekstasis, Holter gets 
groovy, a move that’s pleasantly surpris-
ing considering the often-rigid nature 

of her more cerebral earlier work.
The rest of the album veers between 

heart-achingly gorgeous vocal drone 
pieces (like the Julianna Barwick-
evoking “Boy In The Moon”) and 
more pop-friendly fare, with tracks like 
“Moni Mon Ami” and “In The Same 
Room” pairing Holter’s flexible voice 
with deceptively simple

Though the transition from avant-
garde to pop-friendly is a common 
one recently, few artists do so with the 
grace shown by Holter on Ekstasis. Her 
success lies in creating a more accessi-
ble sound without sacrificing any of the 
inscrutable complexity that made her 
earlier work so delightfully compelling, 
and that is an outstanding accomplish-
ment indeed.

F ollowing the release of sopho-more record Upper Air in 2009, North Carolina folk trio 
Bowerbirds encountered three years of 
hardship: Their dog was run over by 
their tour van, and singers Phil Moore 
and Beth Tacular ended their long-

time relationship. After Tacular came 
down with a mysterious near-death 
illness, the couple decided to get back 
together and record The Clearing — an 
emotional ode to adversity and the 
ways we overcome it.

On “This Year,” Moore croons 
elegantly over subdued organ notes, 
building up the sound and then break-
ing it back down into an ambient 
atmosphere made up of ricocheting 
feedback.

“Overcome With Light” is the 
shortest track on the album at three 
minutes, pairing intense bursts of 
simplistic strumming with Moore’s 
stripped-down vocal harmonies. 
“Hush” offers the same for Tacular’s 

seductive yet relentlessly dark vocals, 
which she confidently boasts over 
ominous vocal samples and an eclectic 
mix of instruments, from shakers to a 
vibraphone, easily making it the most 
poignant track on the record.

“Death Wish” brings the album to 
its darkest depths, invoking images of 
a funeral procession with its deep bass 
notes and solemn trumpet lines, finally 
fading into closer “Now We Hurry On,” 
a crushingly beautiful ballad that lin-
gers for six minutes before it twinkles 
to its end like the opening notes of 
Wonka’s “Pure Imagination.”

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MARCH 1,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

but rather further polarizes the already-marginalized set of pro-Israel groups on campus. 
These progressive, liberal, peace-seeking groups have been increasingly alienated over the 
past few years; this resolution forces the student government to take a stance on the issue, 
and will further alienate one of the two sides. 

When the State of Israel is singled out from a list of eligible sovereign states, students 
whose identities are linked to the country feel singled out and held to a double standard. 
Students should be able to attend a university and feel accepted and represented by their 
student government.
Does this resolution promote a progressive, liberal approach to the conflict?

The resolution requires every student involved in the different aspects of this issue to 
take a simplified stance, either for or against divestment. 

In essence, the resolution both ignores and silences the moderate voices advocating for a 
more nuanced approach to the issues.

In this campaign there is no middle ground. The resolution polarizes an already divided 
group of students, and does not allow for the complex views inherent to the issue. It is 
a myopic approach to a very complicated issue that must be addressed on campus in a 
productive forum. 

This resolution does not belong before an associated student government because 
A.S. Council is charged with providing for a more cohesive campus community, and this 
resolution divides our student population.
What are the possible effects of Divestment?

The resolution does not account for the numerous implications of punishing companies 
who have deep financial- and research-based connections to our university. 

Both General Electric and Northrop Grumman, the two companies targeted in the 
resolution, have research contracts with UCSD, and are a main source of potential jobs for 
our engineering students. 

Calling for divestment and blacklisting these companies will potentially harm our 
reputation with these companies. 

Cutting Ties Harms Existing Connections
▶ TFI, from page 4

Does this resolution advocate for the sweeping divestment of the 
State of Israel? 
     No, we are looking at U.S. companies that profit from violent conflict and occupation. 
Is this resolution anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian? 

Because our university is invested asymmetrically in an ongoing violent conflict, we already as 
an institution are choosing to support one side over another. This resolution seeks to do away with 
the binary of pro-Israeli/pro-Palestinian by focusing on what we can agree on: the need for peace. 
By removing investments from companies who assist in perpetuating the violence in the area, we 
are setting up a forum where peace is achievable. 
If A.S. Council at UCSD recommends the divestment of these companies, what will 
we invest in instead?

We look forward to creating a coalition of students on campus that researches companies with a 
stake in social responsibility. 
How is UCSD invested in these companies?

The UC Retirement and Endowment Funds are invested in indexes. The Russel 3000 index 
includes GE and Northrop Grumman. Investments can be personalized to include and exclude 
whichever companies the investor wants. 
Isn’t investing in these companies profitable?

GE is less than 1 percent value of all the stocks in the U.S.A., financially $210 billion out of 
$25 trillion. Furthermore, we invest globally and U.S.A. is only 35 percent of the global market, so 
GE comes out to even less than 0.3 percent of the global market. Northrup Grumman is less than 
0.1 percent of U.S. value, or $18 billion out of $25 trillion. Divesting from these companies is not 
difficult to do. There are over 5,000 companies that can be invested in the U.S. GE and Northrop 
Grumman are not our only options. 
What percentage of these companies’ profits come from weaponry sold that perpetuates the 
conflict?

About 4 percent of GE’s sales is from weapons and military equipment, and only a portion of 
that goes to Israeli military, while Northrop Grumman is a military equipment company. It doesn’t 
matter how much of their profits are involved in violence, it’s a statement against violence. 

Divestment Moves UCSD Toward Neutrality
▶ SJP, from page 4

since the UC system has money invested in companies linked 
with the Israeli army, but does not monetarily support the 
Palestinian people, divesting would be a statement of neutrality. 
The regents have already stated that the UC system will not 
divest, but the (failed) outcome of the divestment resolution is 
still a crucial symbolic gesture about a controversial world issue.

Given this highly charged issue, when some members of 
the population don’t believe that council should be speaking 
about world issues, and some do, and council contradicts itself, 
we have a problem. The A.S. Council mission statement, per 
its website, specifically states that the leaders should “focus on 
the issues that directly affect the people with whom we have 
the responsibility to serve.” For better or worse, council could 

interpret this wording to specify that it will not weigh in on 
issues of foreign policy or human rights — and simply refuse to 
acknowledge the resolution. But as recently as November 2011, 
council passed the “Resolution in Support of Reclaim UCSD.” 
This resolution stated that “ASUCSD can make decisions 
regarding world events and political issues that deeply impact 
UCSD students and are significant to their student lives,” which 
can read interpreted that council must become an audience to 
resolutions such as the divestment.

This editorial board is not against the November resolution, 
nor are we saying that A.S. Council should not weigh in on 
issues of global importance. This is an enormously complicated 
question that has far-reaching ramifications and influence 
on both levels. Instead, we applaud A.S. Council for defining 
its own role and voting on, instead of tabling, the issue of 

divestment for the first time. Last spring, council voted 13-10-
4 just to create a committee on the topic of divestment before 
moving on to voting, ultimately tabling the resolution. In 
May 2010, council voted 7-8 to indefinitely table that year’s 
divestment resolution regarding General Electric and United 
Technologies. 

For the past two years, council sent the two sides to talk 
it out in a committee, resulting in deadlock because council 
simultaneously thought itself important enough to comment on 
these issues, and then chickened out of taking any true stance. 
But this year, even though it took over seven hours of combined 
public input and proposed amendments, A.S. Council voted 
with no abstentions in the end.

Regardless of your feelings on the decision itself, that in and 
of itself is something to applaud.  

A.S. Council’s Lack of  Abstentions in Divestment Decision Should be Applauded

two RBI, bringing home Lesovsky and 
McQuaid off of one of the two Gator 
errors in the inning. 

After the second inning, the bats 
cooled off on both ends. 

The Tritons would record two 
more runs before the end of six 
innings, with Swanberg hitting a big 
double for her second RBI. 
 
 GAME 3
     UCSD VS SF STATE 3-4 

UCSD took an early 3–0 lead in 
its only loss of the series. In the third 
inning, the Tritons scored off an error 
and tacked on two more runs off 
another Swanberg double to left field. 
Senior All-American Camille Gaito 
kept the Gators scoreless until the 

sixth inning, when the Gators took 
two runs on two Triton fielding errors. 
Still with a slight 3–2 advantage, Gator 
pitcher Marisa Ibarra retired the next 
three Tritons in order. And with its 
last at-bat, San Francisco State took 
the win, converting two runs on two 
sacrifice bunts. 
 
      GAME 4
    UCSD VS SF STATE 11-6

In a rematch between Gaito and 
Ibarra, the Tritons overcame a 1–0 
Gator lead in the bottom of the 
third with a big seven-run inning. 
Swanberg’s big bat sent another double 
to center field. With sophomore 
catcher Caitlin Brown making contact 
to get on base, Swanberg was batted 

in by junior designated hitter Jennifer 
Manuel. Next at-bat junior Tess 
Granath singled up the middle to load 
the bases.

Sykes then sent one to center field 
to give the Tritons the lead. With 
the bases still loaded, Spangler was 
brought on to pinch-hit for McQuaid, 
singling to right center for two RBI. 
Back at the top of the order, Lesovksy 
popped out, but UCSD would score 
two more off a Willmon single and a 
big Romero double to right center. 
UCSD tacked on three runs in 
the next three innings, enough to 
maintain the lead despite a four-run 
sixth inning from the Gators

pitting senior Chapman Chan against 
Whittier’s Julian Seneviratne. 

The No. 1 singles match between Chan 
and Seneviratne was the only match on the 
day that went to three sets. 

Seneviratne — a 2010 All-SCIAC 
selection — took the first set in a close 6–4 
finish. Chan rallied, winning the second set 
6–7, but Seneviratne closed the match out 
with a 10–6 win in the last set. 
    Junior Junya Yoshida and sophomores 
Max Jiganti and Kona Luu easily took 

wins in their singles matches, while 
junior Austin West and Sam Ling both 
had tight first sets but seemed to outlast 
their opponents in the second set to finish 
strong. 
    “Whittier’s a good ball striking club, 
but I think our tenacity made them fade a 
little in the second sets today,” UCSD head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer said to the athletics 
department.  
    In the doubles component, Seneviratne 
led Whittier’s No. 1 doubles to take the 
win over the nationally ranked pair of 
sophomore Devon Sousa and West, 9–8. 
    However, the Tritons handily overtook 
the Poets in the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles 
matches. 

In the No. 2 match, senior Jason Wall 
teamed with Luu to record an 8–3 win, and 
in the No. 3 match, Ling and Yoshida won 
8–5.  
    “Junya Yoshida is a junior this year and 
he’s really played well,” Steidlmayer said 

to the UCSD athletics department. “But 
our last two clinchers, Austin West and 
Max Jiganti, have also done well. Kona 
Luu really elevated his game: A freshman 
from Irvine, he plays No. 2 doubles for us 
and No. 6 singles and really solidified both 
spots. He may be the biggest surprise of the 
year.” 
    With the win, the No. 10 Tritons advance 
to 9–1 this season, posting their only loss 
against Grand Canyon University at the 
Grand Canyon Invitational on Feb. 10. 
    The next competition for the Tritons will 
be on March 1 to March 4 at the Pacific 
Coast Doubles Championships in La Jolla, 
featuring the UCSD duos of West and 
Sousa, Ling and Yoshida and Luu and Wall. 
    UCSD then resumes dual competition, 
with a bout against Division-I Villanova at 
home on March 6.

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

GAME 1
UCSD VS SF STATE 3-0

 
     No. 20 UCSD Softball went into extra 
innings with San Francisco State in the first 
game of the four-game series. Neither team 
recorded a run until the top of the eighth 
inning, when the Tritons loaded the bases.      

With junior Emily McQuaid on third base 
and senior Kris Lesovsky on second, sophomore 
Kristin Willmon bunted to bring home the 
winning run. With just one out, sophomore 
Mya Romero flied out to center field to score 
Lesovsky. 

Up 2–0, the Tritons sealed the win with an 
RBI single from junior Nicole Spangler. 
 
  GAME 2

       UCSD VS SF STATE 7-3

   

In the second game of the series, the Tritons 
got the bats going early. UCSD capitalized on 
a costly Gator error off a Romero bunt that 
advanced Romero to second base, placed 
Willmon on third base and brought Lesovsky 
into score. Up 1–0, sophomore catcher 
Charly Swanberg flied out to left field to score 
Willmon. 

The Gators responded in kind, putting two 
men on base and scoring one man off a bunt by 
Ashley Huff. San Francisco tacked on another 
run off of a sacrifice fly, and took the lead with 
a double to right center.

Down by one run and back at the top of 
the order, Lesovsky singled up the middle to 
bring freshman second baseman Maria Sykes 
into score. With the score tied, the Gators 
brought on pitcher Ali Garcia to relieve Jordan 
Stanaland. Stanaland didn’t fare much better 
as Willmon singled through the right side for

GAME 1
UCSD VS POMONA 5-10

UCSD started strong with a solid first inning as 
sophomore catcher Nick LaFace bombed one to left 
field, putting the Tritons up 1–0. The Broncos came 
back in the bottom of the inning with three hits for two 
runs. The Broncos stayed up for the rest of the game 
despite a rally in the top of the sixth, when UCSD junior 
infielder Sam Michaels singled to right and was batted in 
off sophomore Scott Liske’s first homerun. 

Liske’s second homer came in the ninth, but it was 
too late to make a difference as the Broncos proved too 
strong for the Tritons.

Sophomore Garrett Tuck had a good game at the 
plate, batting three for four with three singles. 
   

GAME 2
 UCSD VS POMONA 6-1 
    The Tritons again opened up big on Friday in the first 
inning as sophomore Justin Rahn singled up the middle 
and advanced to second on a wild pitch and to third on 
a ground out by LaFace. Rahnand scored on a single by 
Seigel. Seigel scored on a Tuck single to right to make it 
2–0.  
    The Broncos responded with a run in the bottom of 
the inning, but junior right-hander Ryan Goodbrand 
shut down Pomona for the rest of the game.  
    In the fifth, LaFace doubled to right to start the rally 
with one out. He was moved to third by a shallow single 
to left field by Siegel. Tuck hit another single to right 
field to bring in LaFace and to move Seigel to second. 
Sophomore Jonah Northrop then reached on a fielder’s 
choice, which was quickly followed by Seigel scoring on 
a Bronco infield error.  
  
  GAME 3
  UCSD VS POMONA 3-9 
    Things started out well for the Tritons as the UCSD 

bats came alive to jump on the Broncos 3–0 in the first 
two innings.  
     Despite losing command in the second, the Bronco’s 
Geoff Brussard did not walk another Triton as he 
continued into the eighth inning for the win after the 
Bronco bats found some spark in the top of the third 
as Pomona center fielder Jordan Whitman homered 
to bring in two runs. In the top of the fifth, the Tritons 
started to struggle on the mound as the Broncos threw 
five runs up on the board on three hits. Most of the runs 
were unearned.

GAME 4
       UCSD VS POMONA 4-3 
    The second game of Saturday’s double header tied up 
the series for the Tritons and moved them up to 4–4 in 
CCAA play.  
    Pitcher Greg Selarz started well for the Tritons, but 
allowed a run in each of the first two innings. He struck 
out three in the first four innings of play and walked 
two. Down 2–0, the Tritons could not get their bats to 
work until the fifth inning.  
    With two outs, Michaels singled to left field, and was 
brought in on the next at-bat from Choi, who homered 
over the left field fence to tie the game. 
    In the top of the sixth, the Broncos manufactured a 
run by moving their left fielder, Douglas Walter, around 
the bases with a little help from the Tritons. Walter got 
on first by a walk, then moved to second on Triton 
pitcher Trevor Scott’s balk. Scott was pulled, and Walter 
was moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and eventually 
scored on a sacrifice fly.  
    Down 3–2, the Tritons came roaring back in the 
bottom of the sixth. Leading off, Rahn was hit by a 
pitch to get on base. LaFace found similar luck and got 
on thanks to an error by the Bronco shortstop, Mike 
Santora. This moved Rahn to third and allowed him 
to score off Tuck’s single up the middle. Ringold and 
Northrop reached as the Bronco errors piled up. Frazier 
would score to put the Tritons up 4–3..
