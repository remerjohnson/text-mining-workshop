Warren deans fire 8 RAs 
Incident with 
minors and 

alcohol leads to 
RAs' dismissal 

By THOMAS NEEUY 
Associate News Editor 

In response to the firing of eight 
Earl Warren College resident 
advisers and one Warren college 
student intern this week, students 
and other RAs spoke out at the Oct. 
9 A.S. Council meeting on their 
behalf. 

The intern and RAs were fired 
for allegedly attending a Sept. 6 
party in a Black Hall apartment, 
where alcoholic drinks were served 
to minors. Residents of the building 
moved in on Sept. 21 and 22 . 

Administrators at Warren col-
lege were tight-lipped about the fir-
ings and were reluctant to say more 
than that the issue was a matter 
between employer and employee. 

"Something occurred that had 
to be investigated that will lead to a 
change in staff," said Jeffrey L. 
Philpott, dean of student affairs at 
Warren college.

United they stand: Sixth College resident advisor Jeremy Gallagher speaks to 
over 120 supporters prior to Oct. 9's meeting of the A.S. council. 

Affairs Joseph Watson, to whom 
college deans are responsible, was 
able to give more information. 

"I understand [the incident in 
question) was a party with alcohol," 
he said. 

Claire Palmer, the resident dean 
of Warren college, called the firings 
a personnel matter and said, "I'm 
bound to confidentiality." 

Palmer was unable to comment 
further about the alleged incident, 
firings or whether the vacated posi-
tions will be filled. Normally, 
Warren college employs a total of 
27 RAs. 

In an Oct. 3 letter sent by 

Palmer, 19 student staff members, 
the vast majority of which were 
RAs, were informed that they were 
put on investigatory leave effective 
immediately, during which time 
they were only allowed to spend 20 
meal points per day on food until 
the investigation of the incident 
concluded. The letter was accom-
panied by copies of the policies that 
were allegedly violated. 

After the investigation, eight of 
the RAs and the one intern received 
letters signed by Palmer on Oct. 8 
notifying them of their release from

CHE CAFE VS. ADMINISTRATION 

UCSD drops complaint 
against Che for links 
Administration shifts attention 
towards alleged hosting of PKK 
By LAURA McGANN 
Associate News Editor 

The Che Cafe Collective is 
once again being accused by the 
administration of hosting a terror-
ist organization's Web si te on 
burn.ucsd.tdu. 

A Che representative confinns 
that the collective received a letter 
from the administration informing 
them of the current situation on 
Oct. 10. No one from the collec-
tive would comment further. 

The collective was initially 
accused of violating the USA 
Patriot Act last month for provid-
ing a link to the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia in a 
letter from Gary Ratcliff, director 
of the University. Centers, on 
Sept. 16. The university has since 
revoked its stance on hyperlinks, 
saying that any organization can 
post a link of its choice. 

The administration then 
changed its position to question-
ing the legality of "hosting," 
which includes the u(sd.edu name 

in a Web site. The C he Cafe 
Collective was later accused of 
hosting the FARC Web sin: on 
the Burn site. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson says the 
FARC is no longer an issue. 

"As I understand it, that has 
been corrected," he said. 

The current investi gation 
involves an allegation that the 
Burn site is hosting the Kurdistan 
Workers Party's Web site. T he 
group is on the U.S. State 
Department's list of foreign ter-
rorist organizations. 

Watson said that. as of two days 
ago, the group is being hosted hy 
Burn. 

"It [the PKK) was still connect-
ed to UCSD in a way that the 
UCSD name was included in the 
address of that organization's Web 
si te," Watson said. 

The linking and hosting issues 
have raised questions of free 
speech among First Amendment

Plans for the first wave of 
expansions to the Student Center 
were announced at the quarterly 
Student Center Town Meeting on 
Oct. 7. 

Representatives from student 
organizations and campus offices 
were on hand when various con-
struction projects for the complex 
were unveiled by Gary Ratcliff, 
director of the University Centers. 

The Women's Center and the 
Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Resource Office have chosen to 
construct their future, permanent 
facilities between Mandeville and 
the north side of the current 
Student Center. 

Ratcliff said that the Women's 
Center, the LGBT Resource 
Office and the Cross-Cultural 
Center have always known that 
their sites were temporary. 

"These three groups have been 
in the process of evaluating possi-
ble si te for relocation for some 
time," Ratcliff said . "All three 
wanted to be around high-traffic 
student areas." 

The Cro - ultural Center has 
opted to set its ights on relocation 

to the future expansion site of the 
Price Center, whereas the other 
two groups decided to remain 
adjacent to the Student Center. 

All three programs are funded 
through the chancellor's office, 
according to Ratcliff. 

"All of the construction will be 
funded by the chancellor because 
these groups are funded by the 
chancellor," Ratcliff said. "They 
have student oriented, academic 
missions. Thereby, the funds for 
that project do not come from the 
Student Center." 

The plans for the expansion 
site are part of a capacity study 
drawn by an outside company 
called Studio E Architects, accord-
ing to Ratcliff. The study desig-
nated four areas immediately sur-
rounding the Student Center 
where future expansion would be 
feasible. The area selected by the 
Women's Center and the LGBT 
Resource Office is one of these 
locations. Their si te offers 9,500-
square feet of building potential. 
The remai ning three areas high-
lighted by the architects would 
offer an additional 5,500 quare 
feet of building potential. 

Though Ratcliff noted that any 
serious or extensive renovations to

Director Gary Ratdiff presented the

the existing Student Center will 
not be undertaken by his office in 
the near future, he did remark that 
the building could use a "facelift." 

"We can't make a broad-sweep-
ing statement that we are going to 
improve everybody's space." he 
said. "There are issue of respon i-
bility in special situations regard-
ing the co-op ."

Surf guitarist Dick Dale 
speaks about music, life 
'60s music icon visits Geisel to 

compliment "Art of Surfing" exhibit 
By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

Dick Dale, surf guitar legend and 
1960s music icon, spoke casually of 
music and his life to students and 
admirers at Geisel Library on Oct. 8. 

The event, which was scheduled 
to be only a speaking engagement, 
lasted for approximately two hours 
and amacted 40 people. 

"I feel naked without the beast 
to play," Dale said, strumming with 
his left hand on an air gui tar. 

Dale, who said he was "born 
under the tracks in Boston," rose to 
popularity in the 1950s and devel-
oped his distinctive sound by play- â€¢ 
ing guitars strung for right-handed 
players with his left hand. By the 
1960s, his unique style became the 
definitive sound of surf guitar. 

One of his most recognized gui-
tar scores, "Misirlou," was featured 
as the opening song on the sound-
track of Quentin Tarantino's 1994 
movie, "Pulp Fiction," 

Dale told the audience that he 
agreed to allow Tarantino to use 
the song because he liked how the 
filmmaker "uses music to make the 
movie" and because Tarantino was 
"not part of the system." 

"I'm for the grassroots guy," 
Dale said. "I've fought [the system) 
since 1955." 

Dale also spoke on numerous 
tangents, ranging from his new-
found vegetarianism, his battle with 
cancer, martial arts and the record-
ing industry and Elvis Presley. 

"Elvis and I were good friends," 
he said. "We used to train togeth-
er." 

On the topic of music, Dale 
spoke to aspiring guitarists and afi-
cionados alike, lauding the tran-
scendentalism of music and its abil-
ity to bring individuals together. 

"Music soothes the beast," he 
said. " It makes you forget about 
your problems." 

Dale spoke emotionally of his 
deceased son and of the health of 
his mother, pausing at times and 
covering his face with his hands. 

"The music is nothing but an 
opening to people 's hearts," he said 
later. 

Dale 's visit was part of an exhib-
it titled "The Art of Surfing," host-
ed by the Music Library, which will 
run until Nov. 30. The event and 
exhibit were funded through a

grant by the American Library 
Association to promote significant 
regional music. 

Scott Paulson, who works in the 
music library and is also the out-
reach coordinator, helped to orga-
nize the exhibit and bring Dale to 
the library to speak. 

"We run these things more 
saloon than salon," he said of the 
unorthodox exhibit, which features 
surf boards, music, album covers, 
surf movies and topographic maps 
of surf locations. 

According to Paulson, surf 
music was chosen because of its 
regional significance to San Diego 
and because of the genre's large 
popularity in the I 960s. 

"It's not a common thing for 
research libraries to have," said R. 
Peter Mueller, head of public ser-
vices at the music library. "We try 
to anticipate the needs of students 
and facul ty." 

Mueller noted that the music 
department has been offering more 
courses rooted in popular music, 
most notably courses on The 
Beatles, rock guitarists, the 19705 
and hip-hop.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS \ 

RA: Fired students must vacate by Oct. 13 
continued from page I 

employment for "violation of uni-
versity policy and state law." The 
lener also stated that their Triton 
Plus accounts and meal cards had 
been deactivated. The students 
have until Oct. 13 to vacate their 
rooms. 

Having lost nearly one-third of 
their RAs, Warren residents felt 
shocked and angry. 

"It's sad. They were only here 
two weeks, and we were really 
happy to have a great RA," said 
Laura Harich, a Warren college 
freshman and resident whose RA 
was fired. "It's really sudden - too 
sudden." 

Some residents felt the decision 
by the college was hasty and harsh. 

"It's absolutely ridiculous," said 
Emiley E1oe, a resident and sopho-
more at Warren college who 
attended the Oct. 9 A.S. Council 
meeting. "I don't understand how 
residential life expects to hire any-
one else or just leave a gap there -
it's ridiculous. They just didn't 
think through their whole deci-
sion." 

The A.S. Council passed a res-
olution by a 17-1 margin to sup-
port the rights ofRAs and encour-
age a town hall meeting of Stu-
dents and administrators to discuss 
the their employee rights. 

The first part of the council 
meeting became an open forum 
where residents and RAs from 

other colleges sounded off about 
the firings. Many chose to address 
the larger issue of student employ-
ee rights, especially when 
employed as an RA. 

Jeremy Paul Gallagher, who is a 
Sixth College RA and A.S. com-
missioner of services and enter-
prises, helped rally support behind 
the Warren RAs and introduced 
the resolution. 

He called the firings a "blatant 
injustice to student life and student 
employee rights" at the A.S. 
Council meeting. He said it was 
unjust that RAs don't have the 
right to appeal administrative deci-
sions and that the eight students 
had to vacate their rooms by Oct. 
13. 

"We're calling for some con-
tract to be written up so this does-
n't happen again," Gallagher said 
in an interview. "We cannot con-
tinue with the injustice that is ram-
pant across campus. " 

Andrew Shim, one of the eight 
RAs fired and a senior at Warren 
college, said he felt no animosity 
toward the deans, but believed he 
was treated heavy-handedly. 

"It felt like we killed somebody, 
like we did something absolutely 
horrible. It hurt all of us, even the 
people who weren't involved," he 
said. 

Part of the RAs' grievance 
against the college was that they 
were held in a room while each RA 

was interviewed individually. They 
claim that they were told to Olrn 
off their cell phones and pagers 
and had to ask for permission to 
use the resrroom. 

Addi tionally, the RAs were 
given no indication of who 
brought the incident up wi th the 
dean. Palmer sa id she was unable 
to comment on how her office was 
notified. 

All eight RAs had completed 
the three-week RA training session 
in early September and worked 
about 12 hours per day during 
Welcome Week. 

"I hope there's 3 resolution to 
this anll RAs do get some rights," 
Shim said . 

Both Palmer and Watson said 
that the srudents had the right to 
appeal by having the case reviewed 
by the next level of supervision. 

"The RA position is a staff 
position, and they have a full range 
of employee rights of appea l," 
Watson said. 

He added that he knew of at 
least two students who were 
appealing the decision. 

Shim said that several of the 
RAs plan on living together off 
campus. For some, this is thei r tim 
time moving away from Warren 
college. 

"Most of us have not lived 
off campus," Shim said, who has 
lived on campus since freshman 
year. 

Water bottles now allowed in all libraries 
New policy also permits liquids in specific, library,safe mugs 

By KIRmN HUBBARD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD Libraries recently 
changed their food and drink poli-
cy to allow water bottles and other 
liquids in a specific, library-
approved mug. 

"Most library users wanted this 
change," said Julie Page, preserva-
tions librarian for the UCSD 
Libraries. "The no-drink policy has 
been difficult to enforce.Â» 

The libraries have modified 
their regulations in two specific 
ways, Page said. First, they are now 
allowing clear water bottles with 
tight sports tops to be brought into 
the library. These may contain only 
water. 

Second, UCSD is adopting 3 
leak-proof mug design for use in 
the libraries, fearuring a spout that 
requires pressure from the fingers 

to open. Once the pressure is 
relea~ed, the spout closes to pro-
duce a leak-proof seal. This mug 

. was tested at UCLA for two years. 
"We weren't initially planning 

to change our policy," Page said. 
"Howeve.r, once we tried UCLAS 
design ourselves, we were extreme-
ly satisfied." 

The UCSD Libraries have 
teamed up with Housing and 
Dining Services to make the mug 
available to srudents. The mug can 
now be purchased at all dining 
locations on campus, as well as the 
Sunshine Store, for the price of 
$3 .75, which includes a free drink. 
Refills through use of the mug are 
also discounted at dining loca tions. 

The library staff chose the logo 
and design of the mug. The library 
receives no proceeds from the 
mug's sales, while Housing and 
Dining Services retains a small 

profit. 
Any nonalcoholic beverage can 

be brought into the libraries when 
it is contained in these mugs. 

"I've brought water bottles into 
the library before and have gotten 
caught," said Kevin Mikolairus, an 
Earl Warren College junior. "I 
mean, ] understand why they don't 
allow food and drinks, but studying 
makes me thirsty. T his is definitely 
a good development. I'm planning 
on getting one of those mugs." 

Food and drink have been 
banned from the library for numer-
ous reasons, including the potential 
damage to books by spilled liquids, 
wease stains or by the insects and 
rodents that food and crumbs 
attract. 

Thus, beverages that do not fol -
low the libraries' new regulations. 
as well as all food items, are still nO! 
allowed on li brary premises.

The UCSO Guardian is published twice a weelt at the University of

University must 
clarify charges, 

Che take a stand 
The UCSD administration first accused 

the Che Cafe Collective of being in viola-
tion of federal law by providing an internet 
link to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia Web site, a, terrorist organiza-
tion per the U.S. State Department. 
Shortly thereafter, the administration 
changed its allegation and charged that the 
burn.1tcsd.edu Web site sponsored by the 
collective violates federal law and universi-
ty policy because it "hosts" the FARC site. 
Now it has dropped the discussion of 
FARC altogether, though nothing on the 
burn.ucsd.edu site has changed this week; 
now at issue is an archive of e-mails posted 
on burn.ucsd.edzt relating to the Kurdistan 
Workers Party, another U.S.-identified 
terrorist organization. 

The Guardian believes that if the admin-
istration is going to censure a student orga-
nization for violating policy, it should take 
the time to research its charges in advance. 
This flip-flopping is an embarrassment to 
UCSD and prevents students from clearly 
understanding the nature of the situation. 

Furthermore, the administration has 
thus far failed to formally charge the collec-
tive with misconduct, so that it doesn't have 
to notify the AS. Council and the Graduate 
Student Association of the alleged viola-
tions. If the university truly feels that feder-
al law is being violated, the Che Cafe must 
be formally charged and other campus 
political bodies must be infonned, as stated 
in the "Memorandum of Understanding." 

We appreciate the university's desire to 
give the Che fair warning before formal-
izing their complaint, but it seems the 
administration is deliberately upbraiding 
the collective in an underhanded and con-
fusing manner; such actions not only set a 
poor example, but also make something 
as simple as abiding by the law an unnec-
essarily drawn-out and hostile process. 

However, the Guardian also believes 
that the Che Cafe has been amiss in its 
reaction to the charges against its Web 
site. The collective should assert its right 
to freedom of speech and information, 
which it has claimed is the purpose of 
linking to and hosting the FARC's Web 
site, and will undoubtedly claim to be the 
motivation for their hosting of the PKK 
information. That six nationally known 
organizations have written a letter to Vice 
Chancellor Joseph Watson on this issue 
shows how important it is; and if the Che 
Cafe is going to take a stand on such uni-
versally important issues, it must be ready 
and willing to follow through on them 
and make them known, especially when 
the administration tries to stop them.

School of engineering IllUSt ensure 
that students get broad education 

Open letter to new ]SOE dean advocates broad 
knowledge base and understanding of society 

By SIMONE SANTIN1 
Senior Staff Writer 

Dear Professor Frieder Seible, 
I wam to extend to you my congrat-

ulations for your nomination last July 
to the position of interim dean of the 
School of Engineering, stepping in 
after Bob Conn's long tenure. I - and, 
I am sure, all the students, faculty and 
employees of UCSD - wish you the 
best luck in this prestigious but difficult 
endeavor. 

I also want to express my hopes that 
your tenure will be more enlightened 
than the previous one and that you will 
reverse some of the preoccupying 
trends that started over the last eight 
years. Trends tha t, though they allowed 
the School of Engineering to climb in 
those silly top-50-many lists that 
administrators like so much, posed a 
severe threat to the quality of education 
at the school and to the independence 
of university research from corporate 
agendas. 

For better or for worse. engineers 
have assumed in the last decades a 
prominent and crucial social role. In a 
society that depends so much on tech-
nology, engineers, as keepers of tech-
nological expertise, are a prominent 
force for the economic, social and cul-
rural development of society. 

This fact demands that a school of 
engineering provide a comprehensive 
humartistic education to its students. I 
hope that you will strive to create, first 
and foremost, curious individuals with a 
broad culrure, politically active and 
socially aware citizens, and that you will 
always consider the - necessary, of 
course - technical education as subor-
dinated to this higher ideal of humanis-

CAMPUS 

" Knowing the latest operating 
system, integrated circuit 

technology ar programming 
language will not create the 
'engineers that our society 
will need in the future ... " 

tic education. Knowing the latest oper-
ating system, integrated circuit tech-
nology or programming language will 
not create the engineers that our soci-
ety will need in the future, unless this 
knowledge is accompanied by a broad-
er understanding of human culrure and 
a critical appreciation of the role, the 
opportunities and the dangers of tech-
nology in our human landscape. 

With today's relevance of engineer-
ing disciplines. technological naivete 

and simple-minded love for technolog-
ical gadgets are no longer viable 
options, and I hope that you will resist 
better than your predecessor the pres-
sure of transforming this institution of 
higher education into a technical school 
in which students are just taught a few 
tricks and techniques to make them eas-
ily employable. 

As it is, there are serious lacunae in 
the general culture of engineers, lacu-
nae that will, inevitably, be reflected in 
the human quality of the work that stu-
dents will do in the future, as well as in 
the connection between their work and 
the more general aspirations of the 
society in which they live. I hope that 
during your tenure, the problem will be 
at least seriously addressed, if not com-
pletely solved. 

Concerns about the quality of 
research carried out at the universiry 
and about the independence of the 
school have also worsened in the last 
decade. due to the increasing corporate 
presence in the school and to the 
increasing power of corporations to 
dictate the school 's research agenda. 
You would do UCSD a great disservice 
if, in your new capacity, you would not 
give these concerns due consideration. 

Things are changing rapidly around 
us, and the university must change to 
respond to the changed necessities of 
the times in which we live. In the past, 
the main concern for the independence 
of the university came from the govern-
ment and. political pressure groups. 
Since the 14th cenrury, universi ties 
have struggled - sometimes success-
fully, sometimes not so much - againsr 
political pressure. In the past century,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Disadvantaged students 

deserve admission 
Editor: 

I was very disappointed when I 
picked up a copy of the Sept. 24 
issue of the Guardian and read 
"Whining pays off in admissions" 
by Dustin Frelich. 

Mr. Frelich, it is unforrunate 
that you have become so reac-
tionary to such a complicated issue 
and have developed an intolerance 
for the plight of so many who 
deserve special attention to their 
circumstances in regards to admis-
sions policy. 

Your first claim - that the uni-
versity has circumvented the "abo-
lition" (interesting word selection) 
of affirmative action by allowing 
srudents of need or misfortune to 
enter the university - is an 
underhanded (and perhaps racist) 
insult hurled at those who honest-
ly deserve to enter the UC system, 
regardless of ethnicity, class, back-
ground, etc. 

According to you, affirmative 
action's "core underlying philoso-
phy is the preference of one group 
of people over another on the 
basis of race." This is' a vast over-
simplification of a program that 
attempted to reverse the myriad 
ways that citizens who come from 
disadvantaged histories are con-
tinually kept out of the systems of 
privilege. 

And that is a vast oversimplifi-
cation of the opposing opinion. By 
claiming that "hard worlc." is the 
only means of gaining succeSs, you 
fail to realize that the world does 
not operate causally for most peaÂ· 
pIe who are not white; middle 
class, heterosexual males. Nor, 
because of the hegemonic systems 
of power, does hard work neces-
sarily equate to success. But I 
digress. 

I graduated from UCSD with a 
. B.A. in 1993. I was first accepted 
in the spring, but then my adnus-
sian was revoked because my 
spring semester high school 
grades had dropped. I appealed 
because of personal hardships in 
my family. I realize that now you 
may be saying, "Ah, of course. 
This guy is one of those whiners." 
Well, if you experienced wha~ I 
went through, it would have 
effected your grades, too, no mat-
ter how "hard" of a worker you 
are. 

What is important is that I was 
given a chance to succeed because 
of my acceptance. I took that 
chance seriously and have entered 
education in an effort to repay mat 
opporrunity, largely because of the 
values that I learned at UCSD. 
You see, not everyone who 
"whines" on their applications is 
unfit for the UC system. Consider 
that before you make egregious 
exaggerations such as, "In essence, 

tion 

the more screwed up you and your 
family are, the better fit you are to 
go off to one of the best college 
systems in the entire United 
States: the UC system." 

If you had it your way, you 
would probably be surrounded by 
mostly white, middle class people 
who like to watch "Seventh 
Heaven" and think gays are great 
as long as they are on "Will and 
Grace." Yes, your plan would 
clearly benefit the UC system. 

I challenge you to pick out the 
students around campus who you 
think "wltined" on their applica-
tions. I bet what you will find are 
the hardest working, most open-
minded students on campus who 
could teach you a thing or two 
about acceptance, compassion and 
vision.

Smallpox vaccine is no 
â€¢ â€¢ panacea agaInst terronsm 

speak up, 
k out 

Parisa Baharian 
It seems that congratulations are 

in order to our government offi-
cials for discovering a vaccine to 
defend against the potentially dev-
astating affects of a bioterrorism 
attack involving smallpox. 

Since smallpox is such a seri-
ous, highly contagious and often 
fatal disease, it is an ideal weapon 
to unleash on an unsuspecting and 
still vulnerable American public. 

Yet before I join in the enthusi-
astic applause of congratulations, I 
can't help but question this sup-
posed good fortune and fairy tale 
ending to such a nightmarish reali-
ty. 

Unfortunately, reading the 
Reuters and CNN coverage on this 
crucial event has only served to 
exasperate instead of resolve my 
concerns. 

An Oct. 4 Reuters wire report 
cites government officials' fears 
that the smallpox developed and 
weaponized by the Soviets fell into 
dangerous hands after the USSR 
collapsed. Reuters reported that 
the government was deciding 
whether to preemptively vaccinate 
the entire population or just the 
medical and safery personnel in 
face of possible bioterrorist attack 
utilizing smallpox. 

An Oct. 7 CNN report, howev-
er, takes a srance on the debate and 
advises the government not to vac-
cinate all Americans due to the vac-
cination's adverse side effects on 

children and those with weakened 
immune systems. 

Bur both media repoIts failed to 
address my fundamental question 
of concern: If it is true that the 
Soviets developed ~ weaponized 
form of smallpox, how then can our 
government blindly state that a 30-
year-old vaccine can adequa tely 
safeguard the health and lives of 
280 million Americans against a 
mutated or weaponized from of 
smallpox? 

Yes, the smallpox vaccine that 
was recently discovered in a ware-
house and turned over to the gov-
ernment is not only 30 years old, 
bu t according to the Centers for 
Disease Control, the vaccine is 
derived from the New York Ci ty 
Board of Health strain of vaccinia 
virus. 

Can we really be so lucky that 
the weaponized form of smallpox 
developed in the Soviet Union is 
identical to the New York Ci ty 
strain) It's highly doubtful. 

So how can the U.S . governÂ· 
ment herald this old New York 
strain vaccine as our salvation with 
this unanswered issue bearing 
down on us? 

It isn't naivete on the part of 
the government. In all probabili ty, 
it centers on the government's 
reluctance to admit to the world 
that the United States' position 
regarding smallpox is not impreg-
nable. In light of the beating the 
United States took on Sept. II , it 
becomes evident that this is a 
deliberate strategy meant to 
strengthen the image of the 
United States. 

The glossy half-t'ruths con-

See COLUMN, Page 6

Column: Americans must 
be aware of terrorism threats 

coruinued from page 5 
cerning the all-saving powers of 
the curren t vacci ne then serve a 
purpose - that of national securi-
ry. 

However, this sweeping wlder 
the rug of any questions of the ade-
quacy of dle vaccine when pitted 
against a manufactured, mutated 
form of smallpox can cause 
Immense harm. 

First, this propaganda push that 
IS touting the vaccine wonder drug 
in an attempt to convi nce the 
Ameri can public not to fear the 
threat of sma llpox will backfire 
badly. 

By deliberately lulling the 
American public into a false sense 
of securiry, America will once again 
be sleeping when the enemy 
attacks. What shameful, backward 
steps we have taken from the 
lessons learned post-Sept. II . 

Second, any course of action 
proposed for the country under this 
,ugar-coated mentaliry would be 
catastropillc. 

Before the CDC can adequate-
ly adVIse the presIdent on a course 
of action in face of this bioterror-
ism weapon, we must address the 
ques ti on of the efficacy of the 30-
year-old vaccine up against newly 
mutated and weaponized sma ll -
pox. 

Otherwise, the efforts in vacci-
nating the 10 million emergency 
workers - or potentia lly even all 
Americans - will be in vain if it 
cannot be establi hed conclusively 
once and for all that the vaccine 
will protect against weaponized 
forms of smallpox. 

I 

So how does the government 
achieve this end? 

Simple. 
If the United States hasn't 

already gotten its hands on some of 
the Soviet-derived smallpox, that 
must be made the first prioriry so 
that a fool -proof vaccine can be 
created. If possi ble, diplomatic 
means should be used first to attain 
it. Then try bribery, giving the 
Russians lots of cash or incentives. 
If all fails, send in special forces to 
sneak into some lab or storage cen-
ter to bring back the weaponized 
form. 

After rlle horrors of mistakes 
made by our imelligence commu-
niry prior to Sept. II attacks, we 
cannot afford to be lax or compla-
cent in rllis heightened state of 
alert. 

Rather than sounding the 
trumpet of success with this 
alleged miraculous vaccine, we 
should be sounding the trumpet of 
cautionary hope and continued 
vigilance . 

An up-front policy with regard 
to pubic safety is the onl y just pol-
icy in wake of the Sept. II attacks. 
I advise all government officials to 
deal the hand straight up where 
the vaccine for smallpox is con-
cerned; otherwise, be prepared for 
rlle widespread fallout . 

This columnist asks that any issues 
of concern within our school, nation 
or world to be brought to her atten-
tion. Only the serious and passion-
ately committed need reply to pba-
haria@ucsd.edu.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10,2002 

Engineering: Avoid corporate interests 
continued from page 4 

institutions like the National 
Science Foundation have been 
created so that the essential fund-
ing for research will be kept 
shielded from government pres-
sure as much as possible, and sub-
ject only to rlle most rigorous 
process of peer review. 

Today, the major concern for 
the independence of the wUversi-
ry doesn't come from poIiticaJ 
forces but from economic ones, 
and we must make sure rllat the 
free pursuit of research will be 
guaranteed against this new influ-
ence. 

More and more research fund-
ing is coming from private sources, 
and wirll it comes the accompany-
ing corporate pressure that, on one 
hand, is contributing to narroWing 
and trivializing rlle education of 
the average engineer _and, on rlle 

orller hand, is narrowing and trivi-
ali zing university research. 
Corporations need the wUversity 
for extremely specific application-
oriented projects, tend to finance 
only research of restricted scope 
and in restricted application 
domain, and threaten rlle free dis-
tribution of knowledge to which 
rlle university is committed. You 
must not allow rlle school of engi-
neering to become rlle research 
and development department of 
local companies. 

Initiatives like California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology con-
tain rlle potential for increased cor-
porate control of research and for 
permeating the univer.;ity with cor-
porate logic - a logic rllat already 
allowed the J acobses to give their 
name to the school not for rlleir sci-
entific merit (which is limited in 

J acobs' case) but for having a few 
million dollars to spend. 

In this new scenario, the uni-
versiry, particularly the school that 
you are going to lead, needs to 
change in order (Q defend rlle inde-
pendence of res arch from corpo-
rate agendas. I invite you (Q place 
the school at the forefront of a 
movement to shield engineering 
research from corporate influence, 
creating non-profit organizations 
that will collect corporate research 
money and will do for corporate 
funding what me NFS did for rlle 
government: guarantee that uni-
ver.;ity research wilJ move by its 
own internal logic, subject only to 
a rigorous peer-review process. 

The problems rllat you will 
face in your tenure are many and 
complex, and I wish you all the 
wisdom, Â· strength and luck that 
yo.u will need to face rllem. 

Letters: Solar energy would help UCs 
continued from page 5 

use at leas t 50 percent renewable 
energy. They should vote "yes. " 

Scientists, including those 
from our universi ty, have been 
discussing global climate change. 
Many support that global warm-
ing is occurring. They advise that 
we need policy initiatives to 
counter it unless we wish to bear 
the consequences, such as more 
disastrous weather events and fur-
ther spreading of tropical dis-
eases. 

To counteract this, d ean ener-
gy sou rces such as solar power will 
be implemented. In fact, even rlle 
most skeptical observers are look-
ing to a smooth transition to 
renewable energy in a few 
decades, rather tha n a perpetual 

dependence on fossil fuels, the use 
of which produces global warming 
pollutants. 

Like the rest of California, the 
university has been depending on 
imported fossil fuels, burning gas 
and oil for energy. This con-
tributes to global warming, and is 
economically and environmental-
ly unsustainable. The issue 
becomes more crucial than ever, 
as rlle Universiry of California 
starts to develop a new campus in 
Merced, constructing more than 
any other organization in the 
state . 

The UC Regents, by voting for 
solar energy, will alleviate this 
problem. Combined widl careful 
design, the new "green" buildings 
will take full advantage of Â· the 

Golden State 's beautiful Â·weather, 
with medium - (Q long- term cost 
benefits. The universiry, as the 
state's leader in research and edu-
cation, must spea rhead this 
change for California. 

This month, the UC 
Sustainabiliry Coalition will be 
calling on the regents to suppOrt 
renewable energy. We request 
your newspaper to support this 
campaign, and urge students, fac-
ulty and all interes ted to do the 
same.

UCSD employees dispute sick leave 
Officials say they have considered policy changes 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 

Sen ior Staff Writer 

UCS D Mail Services and 
Business and Financial Service 

tore house employees are contest-
ing what they believe to be an 
unfair allocaoon o i sick leave hours 
by their supervisors. At issue are 
some H hours per year of leave 
accrued under UCS D employee 
regulatIOns but purportedly not 
Jvallable to rllese employees. 

T he disputing SIdes met on 
Ocr. 3 in a meeting that Ame rican 
Fede ration of State, Counry and 
Municipal Employees organizer 
Juan Astorga called " negotiations" 
and UCSD Labor Relations rep-
resentative Dan Wyman charac-
te rized as a discussion of "minor 
issues." 

Ap pendix A of the UCS D 
Implementing Procedures states 
rllat full-time UCSD employees 
accrue 8 hours of paid sick leave 
per month - a total of 96 hours 
per year. Mail Services and 
Business and Fi nancial Services 
Storehouse employees, however, 
are allowed only 72 hours of paid 
sick leave per year - then supervi-
sors may discipline them. 
Employees who use time over this 
limit are subject to disciplinary 
actio ns, mail processor Melvyn 
Allen said. 

Mail Services supervisors Jorge 
Espinoza and Fred Gomez, and 
BFS associate co nt ro ller Sally 
Brainard, who oversees Mail 
Services, declined to comment. 

Wyman said the deparrment ' 
sick leave pol icy dates back to 
198 1 and is based o n supervisors' 
study of employee attendance and 
desire to improve it. 

"It allows employers to know at 
what point the department 
becomes concerned with an 
employee'S artendance," Wyman 
said in regards to the 72-hollf limit. 

At Oct. 3 meeting were Mail 
Services and Storehouse employ-
ees and supervisors, organizers 
from AFSCME, and labor rela-
tions representatives on behalf of 
the uruversi ry. 

One issue discussed was an 
alleged failure of supervisors to 
notify employees when they were

Going postal: Mail SeNices workers are allowed 72 hours of sick leave per year. 

approaching their 72-hour sick 
leave limit. Allen said in the past, 
many employees were allowed to 
exceed this limit, and only after one 
employee was caught taking too 
much sick leave earlier this year did 
they review other employees' files 
and issue retroactive citations to 
rllosc fOWld over the limit. 

Wyman, however, said, "The 
rules have been applied as have 
been written as far as I know." 

According to Allen and mail 
processor Ana G asper, supervisors 
at the meeting reiterated their 
policy of notifying employees 
when rlley were approaching their 
72-hour sick leave limit, and of 
uniformly enforcing sick leave 
standards. Additionally, Wyman 
said other options regarding the 

issue were under consideration. 
"The universiry does intend to 

look at policy more closely, and we 
have al ready discussed some 
changes," Wyman said . "We may 
not ultimately do everything 
they'd like to have happen ." 

Reactions from employees and 
union mem bers were mixed. 
Gasper characterized rlle meeting 
as "negative" while ASFCME 
organizer Irene Corozco saw pos-
itive signs. 

"They agreed to look into it," 
she said. "That's always positive 
where the union is concerned." 

Wyman expects to fo ll ow up 
with the union some time next 
week. U ntil then, he said he is try-
ing to "keep the lines of communi-
cation open."

PKK material is

concinued from page I

signed a letter to the admini nation 
protesting the actions taken against

The American Booksellers 
Foundation for Free Expres~i()n 
said that it sigrtt:d the Icrtcr III 
defense of snldent fights. 

"vVe are a free peech group, 
generally, 'Ind we are concerned 
with the Patriot Act. This obviouslv 
piqued our interest," said ABFF.F. 
President Chris Finan . 

The ABFEE is against censoring 
links, but is dubious about hosting. 

"W e haven't taken a final posi-
tion on whether or not that speech 
is protected," Finan said. 

Currently, the collective is not 
facing a formal charge of miscon-
duct. Watson said that they have 
only been instructed to desist in 
hosting the link. 

"I am not awa re that they 
received a formal charge of miscon-
duct. They did receive a letter from 
us indicati ng this matter of the 
Web site of the organi zation 
including the UCSD name and 
asked to correct the si tuation ," 
Watson said .

dums with the purpose of funding 
university expansion, Ratcliff said 
that he docs not want to have to 
rely on the passage of a referen-
dum. 

"Some also think we should 
wait for future referendums and 
the resul ting influx of dollars," hc 
said. "But my mindset is that we 

~houldn't walt to do what wc

One such fcc referendum wa s 
turned down by undcrgradu a te

T here are numerous, small er

interior seating and general meet-
ing places both in and out of doors 
at the Student Center. AJrc:ldy 
underway is a project to install new 
seating by the grassy knoll known 
as the "Hump," as well as around 
the second floor. In total, thcre 
will evennlally be about 125 new 
seats available in and around the 
Student Center. 

The Student Center reserve 
funds will fund all of the smaller 
projects mentioned. Ratcli ff main-
tains that there will not be a need 
for any sort of student-decided fcc 
referendpm in those case . 
Completion of the various projects 
is slated for spring 2005. 

James Lynch, University

that there is discussion of further 
expansion of both the Student 
Center and the P rice Center. 

"Both the Student Center and 
the Price Center are running at or 
above capacity now with regards w 
the number of students they 
serve," Lynch said. 

"There has been a task force 
chartered by [the A.S. Council] to 
consi der these i sues," he said. 
"There will be a couple of surveys 
out this fall to gauge the student 
desire for expansion . There is" def-
inite potential for student referen-
dums either this winter or spring 
to fund this future expansion ."

Featuring Blackalicious, 
MxPx and Jurassic 5 

By HANA HSU 
Staff writer 

Since its creation in 1998, Fall Fest has 
enjoyed increasing popularity but has also 
struggled with challenges, such as finding a 
musica l lineup appealing to the whole 
UCSD community and accommodating the 
crowd at RIMAC Arena . A5 Fall Fest turns 
five this year, the A.S . Programmlllg Office 
has introd uced some additions that, it is 
hoped, wi ll make it even better: a th eme 

A. S. Council aims to set a precedent by giving UCSD 
students a more spirited, appealing campuswide event 

and prizes. 
Last year 's F allF est, fea turing Afroman, 

Warren G and Alien Ant Farm, drew both 
praise and pains. Junior Â¥I-fang Tsai, senior 
Y1a n Jacopack and senior Ali Ginn were 
generally pleased with the performances, 
especially Alien Ant Farm's energetic set. 

Ginn said, "They need to accommodate 
everyone if they're going to make it free." 

For this year's Fall Fest, Tsai is excited, 
saying, "Everyo ne's been talking about 
Blackalicious .. . and Jurassic 5 on ly had two 
members when they came for a nooner, so 
now that t hey're complete. It should be a 
good show." Bur many students complained about the 

long lines. As sophomore Sheetal Patel put 
it, "It took days to get in." 

Senior Tommy Heng said, "I had to try 
to sneak in." 

Jacopack looks forward to MxPx's punk 
and Jurassic 5's new single, while Heng 
says, "J urassic 5 again? We need Nelly, Dr. 
Ore or Ludacris."

MxPx is the "Leave it to Beaver" version of the Sex 
Pistols. 

They're empathetic, not apathetic. They have tattoos, 
but don 't do anything crazy like cut themselves and bleed 
onstage. Plus, drummer Yuri Ruley went and got married 
- a total blast from the past. A bon afide member of a 
punk band went and got married. 

Its classic Americana Pop Punk. Even Grandma would 
listen to it. 

Grandma would not, however, get in the pit for an 
MxPx show. Grarnma would be on the ground in two sec-
onds flat. Although MxPx has a reputation for being good 
guys in a punk world, they still bring down the house at a 
show. 

MxPx has had a loyal audience since they released their 
record debut, "Pokinatcha," at the tender age of 17. Their 
senior year, they recorded their second album, "Teenage 
Politics," and the Monday following graduation, they went 
on their first national tour. 

Told you it was total Americana . A little bit of high 
school, a good band and a national tour - you know, just 
your regular high school student. 

The music ranges from hardcore, fast punk riffs 
to slower melodies . Mike Herrera 's vocals actually hold

While majority-pleasi ng lineups and 
long lines will likely still be a problem, the 
A.S. Programming Office has made some 
improvements to make thi s fall's concert 
more accessible and attractive . New this 
year is a theme - "School Spirit" - and a 
raffle prize drawing for the first 100 to 200 
students wearing UCSD gear.

FaliFest: Taking it to the Creen 
Festivities to start with entertainment on Library Walk and beyond 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Hiatus Editor 

In addition to the musical line-
up of Fall Fest, there is also the pro-
gramming - Fall Fest on the 
Green. This event takes place on 
Library Walk and Price Center 
Plaza, and is a fair put on by the 
Student Organization and 
Leadership Opportunities Office . 

Now in its 19th year, F.O.G. -
the namesake of FallFest ... is over-
shadowed by the entertainment in 
the evening. Back in the 1980s, 
F.O.G began as Bizarre Bazaar, 
which was moscly a recreational 
clubs event, but the student organi-
zations soon dominated the dis-
plays. The affair was then located 

south of the rec gym, which was -
surprise, surprise - a green field. 
Thus the fall festival held on the 
green became Fall Fest on the 
Green, and the quarterly music 
programming followed suit in 
name nor long after. 

Every year, F.O.G . brings 
together over \00 student organi-
zations to put up booths and 
solicit new members to get 
involved in campus life. 
Organizations were allowed to 
sign up until Oct. 9, and by Oct. 7 
there were over 70 campus groups 
that had already reserved spaces. 
Some will have more then just a 
table; there will also be perfor-
mances by musical groups, 
including Ascension, the Chinese 

â€¢ 

Student Association's Hip-Hop 
team, the Pep Band, the Campus 
Greens, and many others . 

Fundraising will take place 
alongside food booths to feed 
hungry students with a variety of 
ethnic variations to delight your 
taste buds. About a dozen differ-
ent clubs will be taking full advan-
tage of the opportunity to display 
their culinary talents with an 
explanation of their group's pur-
pose to the campus community. 

So if you're looking for a way 
to get involved or just meet new 
people, then check out Library 
Walk and Price Center Plaza from 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Oct. 11 to 
find out everything about the peo-
ple and activities of UCSD . 

album reviews 

Jurassic 5 
"Power in Numbers" 

interscope 

**** 
"We take it back to the days of 

yes y'all-in', we holding onto 
what's golden," boast MCs Chali 
2na, Zaakir, Akil and Marc 7, 
backed by DJs Nu-Mark and Cut 
Chemist, on "What's Golden," 
the first single off Jurassic 5's sec-
ond full-length album. This 
proves to be more than mere 
braggadocio, as "Power in 
Numbers" lives up to the group's 
substantial hype and widely 
acknowledged potential. 

Mter delivering a mouthwa-
tering, self-produced EP in 
1997 (later rereleased by 
Interscope), J5 slowly made 
their way from the L.A. under-
ground, a hip-hop scene that 
generated like-minded groups 
such as The Pharcyde, into the 
mainstream. Their 2000 full-
length album "Quality Control" 
and its eponymous single gar-
nered hefty support from vari-
ous outlets such as MTV2 . 

A slot on the 2000 Vans 
Warped Tour ensured Jurassic 5's 
crossover appeal, putting them in 
the same league as contempo-
raries Black Eyed Peas and The 
Roots. 

"Power in Numbers" is said 
by Marc 7 to be "a sign of the 
times," with a "darker, harder 
edge" than the group's previous 
work. Social commentary, such 
as, "If you wanna fight the 
power get the power to fight," 
from the song "Sum of Us,Â· 
abounds, usually with enough 
conviction not to sound trite or 
forced. 

Elsewhere, the band sounds 
looser, with a Beastie Boys-esque 
sense of fun . "Well, it's the verbal 
Herman Munster," declares 
Charlie 2na on "What's Golden," 

completely stealing the show. 
Changes in lyrical direction 

and musical approach help the 
album avoid stagnancy. "Thin 
Line," a mellow pop song that 
ponders hypothetical relation-
ships between men and women, 
fea tures guest vocals by a deftly 
understated Nelly Furtado and 
directly follows the bouncing, 
jovial "What's Golden." 

Other guest appearances, 
such as by lyricists Percee P and 
Big Daddy Kane on the fa st-
paced "A Day at the Races" and 
producer J uJ u from the Beatnuts 
on "If You Only Knew," further 
enrich the sound of the album 
without diverting attention from 
the group's own MCs and DJs . 

The group sometimes gets lost 
in its struggle to be both amiable 
and profound. The unfortunately 
titled "I Am Somebody" includes 
empty lyrics like "lead and never 
follow" that fall flat against a 
party-funk backdrop. 

Ultimately, the group's 
adventurousness and conflicting 
senses of fun and worldly 
awareness make "Power in 
Numbers" an intriguing, stand-
out release.

Fest: Freshmen need to check out free event 
Continued [rum page 9 

include airplane tickets, J ad, 
Johnson concert tickets and signed 
paraphernalia from Fall Fest artists. 

The theme and prizes, explained 
Kim and Kushner, are both a 
reward and an incentive for UCSD 
students to come to Fall Fest. First, 
the raffle encourages students to 
come earlier, which may help alle-
viate the long lines. Moreover, 
Kushner hopes "[these improve-
ments 1 will set a precedent for a 
top-notch show." 

Kushner said, "We're hoping to 
get people who aren't really into 
all-campus events to check it out. 
To students, this is just a free on-
campus event. But the box office, 
the agents, the bands themselves 
have all been inundated with calls 
to make it open to the public." 

"We want to get the freshmen. 
into it, but we also want to appeal 
to all the classes," Kim said. 
"We're gonna pack RlMAC again 
this year. We'll probably have to 
turn a .thousand away." 

So if you're ready to see what 

the buzz is all about, get there 
early and show some sartorial

Jurassic: 2na discusses creative 
process involved in making new album 

Continutd frrnn pagt 9 
2na: We wrote this track and then realized 

we needed a woman's perspective. The track 
deals with the issue of attraction versus 
friendship, and we needed a woman to com-
plete the vibe of the track. 

Brian: What's in your CD player right 
now? 

2na: Let me check. Hold on. It's a Beat 
CD by 88 Keys. 

Brian: How's the tour been so far? 
2na: I don't know if you can say the tour's 

started yet. We've been playing a lot of pro-
motional shows, but the tour actually starts 
this week. I don 't consider LA. to be part of 
the tour because we call the House of Blues 
home, so I guess you can say San Diego actu-
ally kicks off the "Power in Numbers" tour. 

Brian: Do you guys have a video for the 
first single? 

2na: The first single on the record is 
"What's Golden," and this guy Logan did the 
video for us . It was a great collaboration. He 
really incorporated our ideas and desires into 
the video. As for the next single, we haven't 
really made a decision about it. We'll have to 
wait and see how people react to "What's 
Golden." [ guess we have more options com-
ercially than we did on the first album. 

Brian: Yeah, I heard your shit on 
KROQ. That's pretty cool! 

2na: You know what I'm talkin' about. We 
just want people to listen to our music. And if 
rock stations pick up the music, we don 't 
mind it. 

Brian: Who produced the album? 
What was the experience like in the stu-
dio? 

2na: We produced the album ourselves. 
DJ NewnJark did most of the mixing. We did 
it at his studio in his house. 

Brian: Where are you guys from? 
2na: Los Angeles, mostly. I 'm from 

Chicago, but everyone else is from L.A. 

Brian: I don't know if you have a day 
off after the show Friday night, but when 
you guys come to SD, what do you like to 
do on your off time? Any hot spots to 
visit? 

2na: What's that place called? Ocean 
Beach. We like to hang out in Ocean Beach. 

Brian: What coUeges did you guys go 
to? 

2na: You mean what colleges have we 
played at? 

Brian: No. I mean did you guys go to 
coUege? 

2na: Yeah. We've been to many colleges, 
but if you mean did we sit down in class and 
take tests - no. A couple of us tried, but it 
didn't work out. We were too focused on the 
music. 

Brian: Any advice to give our readers 
about the college experience? 

2na: I never really experienced college. 
But I've noticed how the pressure of study-
ing gets to kids, so it's a beautiful release 
when you see students getting wild at our 
shows. 

Brian: Snowboarding season's coming 
up. Think you'U find time to ride? 

2na: Snowboarding'S kind of scary. We 
tried it after a show we played a couple of 
years ago, but we just fell on our faces all day. 
All falling on your face makes is a scary 
proposition. But my son's 11 and if wants to 
try it out, I'm all for it. 

Brian: How long have you been mak-
ing music and how did it all start? 

2na: We've been doing this for nine and a 
half years. It all started at a cafe in LA. called 
The Good Life. They used to have open mic 
night. Cat's had skills and gave an opportuni-
ty to get a record deal. I used to be in a group 
call Unity Committee, and there was this 
other group called the Rebels of Rhythm. 
We dug each other's shit and started making 
music together. One night we were back 
stage and talkin ' about how we wanted to be 
like the Fantastic 5. The mother of my son 
said we sounded more Jurassic than Fantastic 
and the name stuck. 

Brian: If my research is correct, you've 
never played SDSU. Any reasons for that? 

2na: I'm sure we have fa ns at SDSU, too, 
but you guys always ask first, so we end up ar 
RIMAC or on the field . 

Brian: Well, we look forward to seeing 
you on Friday. Any last words for our 
readers? 

2na: Blesses to all who read cllls. We 
appreciate our fans inquiring about liS in any 
way they might. Hopefully, these words will 
bring you to the show. 

Blackalicious: Group mixes rhythm 
and melody to create fresh hip .. hop 

Continurd [rum pagt 9 
hip-hop forerunners De La Soul and A Tribe 
Called Quest rather than the "gangsta" rap-
pers who traditionally characterize West 
Coast hip-hop. 

Gab and Xcel formed Blackalicious in 1992, 
but bounced around Davis, Calif., collaborat-
ing with friends in the SoleSides (later known 
as Quannum) crew before recording their first 
serious EP, "Melodica," in 1995. The "A2G" 
EP followed in 1999, fe2turing the crowd-
pleasing "Alphabet Aerobics," a collaboration 
with Cut Chemist (of Jurassic 5 and Owmatli 
fame) that showcased Gab's innovative 
rhyming skills. The year 2000 saw the release 
of Blaclaliciouss first full-length LP, "Nia,Â· 
which garnered raves and sparked a major-

Â·Iabel bidding war eventually won by MeA. 
"Blazing Arrow," the group's latest and 

most ambitious release features "Chemical 
Calisthenics," another Cut Chemist "work-

out," that arrived this April. 
While "Blazing Arrow" retains the 

smooth, flowing feel of Blackalicious's ear -
lier work, it is a significantly more expan -
sive effort. Gab and Xcel are joined by an 
array of guest artists including Ben Harper, 
Zach de la Rocha, the Roots' ?uestlove, and 
J5's Chali 2na. Equally important, Xcel 
plays composer on most tracks, leading live 
strings, horns, bass, keys and ki ts. 

Listening to "Blazing Arrow," several 
things become clear. Blackalicious is hands-
down one of the most creative hip-hop 
groups out there. They have a great ear for 
matching rhythm with melody. And they def-
initely aren't afraid to challenge the conven-
tions of hip-hop. 

So what does this mean for the good stu-
dents of UCSD? Well, if Cut Chemist joins 
Blackalicious onstage tomorrow night, as 
one would surely expect him to, we might 
get the coolest chemistry lecture of our lives.

You can't fight the Beast or Travolta 
New DVDs offer up a grand serving of extras and super movies 

By CHARLIE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he "Beauty and the Beast" 
DVD is similar to the villain 
Gaston: No one can fight or match 
wits like Gaston, or in this case, no 
DVD can compare to Gaston, err 
... "Beauty and the Beast." 

The film is more that just a 
reaftirmation of the Disney anima-
tion renaissance. The film com-
bi nes a stellar storyline with 
Broadway-style songs to create one 
of the most beloved animated films 
that h:l ever graced the screen. 

The only animated film ever to 
be nominated for an Academy 
Award for best picture, "Beauty 
and the Beast" manages to capture 
the hearts of not only children, 
but also mature audiences. For 
college students, the film manages 
to delve into adult themes, but 
with chorus-rousing songs such as 
"Belle," "Be Our Guest" and 
"Gaston." There is no doubt that 
the film appeals to all ages. 

The story is universally known. 
French Belle (voiced by Page 
O'Hara) is a young woman yearn-
ing for something new and exci t-
ing to take her away from her 
dreary life. Unbeknownst to her, a 
prince (voiced by Robby Benson) 
has been turned into a be:v;t and 
can only transform back into 
human form when he ma nages to 
make a woman love him in renlrn. 

Years of neglect and se lf-pity 
have made the beast a heartless, 
lonely animal. Supporting him is a 
cheerfully delightful cast of 
housewares from pots to candle-
sticks - they too have been 
turned from humans into house-
hold objecs. 

Mount St. Mary's College 
proudly announces its new 
Doctor of Physical Therapy 
and Master of Science in 
Nursing Education programs. 

DVD 
REVIEW 

For the Platinum Edition 
release, Disney has gone to great 
lengths to provide an in-depth 
analysis of the film. The two-disc 
set boasts three (that's right, three) 
different versions of the film to 
choose from. In addition, the first 
disc also contains an audio com-
mentary by those who made the 
film. 

The second disk is a treasure 
chest of extras for the most rabid of 
film buffs. Included in the second 
disk is a documentary, music videos, 
games and production featurenes 
that would take days to finish. 

The "Beauty and the Beas t" 
DVD is only offered for a limited 
time before the next films in the 
platinum series are released . 
Totaling 10 films, the series is 
released in rotation, so "Beauty 
and the Beast" won't be in stores 
again until 20 12. The DVD is an 
absolute must-have for any fi lm 
library, regardless of age.

Rated G 

When "Saturday Night Fever" 
hit theaters, there had never been 
anything like it before; never had 

there been a film that had a sound-
track so tightly knitted to the 
scrip t. From the unforgettable 
opening strut of Tony Manero to 
his Rashy, white polyester suit, 
"Saturday Night Fever" is an 
homage to the days when disco 
reigned supreme. 

For Manero Oohn Travolta), 
dancing is an integral part (and the 
only source of stability) of his life. 
A hlan without ambition or gravi-
!as, Manera is going nowhere and 
seems as though he will be stuck in 
Brooklyn for the rest of his life. It 
is through the love of disco that 
Manero gains the ability to escape 
his past. 

Travolta '5 performance is 
undoubtedly one of his finest, 
marking him as a Hollywood leg-
end. 

The special 25th anniversary 
DVD edition of the film boasts an 
audio commentary by the director, 
deleted scenes and highlight clips 
from VH Is " Behind the Music." 
The DVD is packed with extras 
that you can groove to, but like 
disco, it only lasts fo r a while 
before the music dies. Although 
more could've been added for a 
venerable pop icon such as 
"Saturday Night Fever," it is 
enough to appease most filmgoers. 
But then again, how could YOll ever 
resist the pinnacle of disco fever?

'Knockaround' delivers a 
soft punch that satisfies 
Film uses star power well despite weak script 

By DAVE BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

While films have asked their 
audiences to sympathize with mob-
sters before, none have been so 
focu sed on the downside of the mob 
being a family business like 
"Knockaround Guys." This film 
follows four 20-somethings on their 
journey into the "real world ." The 
film opens as Matty Demaret (Berry 
Pepper) is turned down at a job 
interview for his dream job. His 
infamous last name means that he 
has no real shot at legitimacy, and 
when he turns to his father to take 
the family reigns, he is turned away 
because he is trigger shy. 

The film tries to get the audience 
to sympathizes with Matty, whose 
dreams were stolen from him by his 
father a long time ago. The sympa-
thy comes hard, however. when 
Matty's father (Dennis Hopper) 
asks, "What do you have to com-
plain about? You drive a Cadillac.H 
Stuck as most 2O-somethings in 
films tend to be, "Knockaround 
Guys" is all about what Matty does 
to earn his father's trust and break 

~ Film L7I---R-EV:....:...:.IEW~ 
into the world of illegitimacy. 

This fi lm's script was the sopho-
more arrival from the team that 
brought about the cult hit 
"Rounders." While the script Strug-
gles from trying to playoff too many 
themes, it does a good job of incor-
porating all of the film 's sta r power. 
With a cast that engages the comic 
hijinks of Seth Green, the quirky 
brilliance of both John Malkovieh 
and Hopper, and one serious beat-
ing via Yin Diesel , "Knockaround 
Guys" is sure to have a little of 
something for everyone. 

All of these performances arc 
diversions from a film that rests on 
the shoulders of Pepper. While 
Pepper does his job well, he is short 
an intelligent script to work with. 
"Knockaround Guys" lacks the 
inteligence that made "Rounders" a 
standout film .

many complex emotions in 90 nun-

MxPx: Band produces melody 
and hard sound simultaneously 

C{)7ltinlltd frum page 9 
some talent; this guy doesn't 
scream, he actually carries his rune 
in a bucket. Plus, he warms the 
crowd. If you find yourself in an 
MxPx pil, chances are you Ife 
singing along. Or just moving your 
lips, pretending to sing along. After 
all, you do want to be' one of !he 
cool people. 

Tom Wiseniewski holds his own 
in the punic guitarisl group. He is a 
member of this scared associatioa, 
and has the stage antics to show it. 
An MxPx audience has seen 
Wiseniewski hang the edge of his 
shoes off the stage and put forth an 
energy that is unique UntO itself. 

1'Jte band IS a whole produces a 
sound that is melodic and hard II 
the same time. Herrera and 
Wiseniewski take care of the slow, 
pretty parts, and Yuri is the man 
with the drumbeat in the back. 

Yuri is quite a character. His 
facial expressions seein to read, 
"My arms are killing me from 
pounding these drums so much, 
but man, am I having fun." 

The crowd knows when a band 
is having fun. MxPx has a grand 01' 
time on the stage - the light stage 
banter in between songs lets every-
one know that. These guys are reg-
ular chums from high school, and it 
shows. 

All good things, however, come 
through hard work. It's been a bat-
tle to distance themselves from 
holes fans may want to peg the 
band into. 

The title of their recent release, 

"10 Years and Running," is an obvi-
ous nod to their "work-hard -and 
you-shall-receive" mantra . The 
three friends have been grinding 
aI bums since their adolescence and 
hitting the concert circuit for quite 
some time. 11Us album shows that 
they plan to keep up the pace. 

Thanlcfully, ~Responsibility" 
was omitted from ws IO-year 
compilation CD. It is the moSI ~cÂ­
ognitable radio song. and the 
absence of it is a bold statement. 
Instead, the music nnga from a 
grassroots, sing-a1ong-or-else ver-
sion of "Punk Rawk Show." It has a 
rough, live show appeal. 

But if you want polished MxPx, 
skip ahead to "My Life Story." It 
leans toward a pop sound, which is 
not bad, just glossed. 

In its entirety, the CD is a trip 
down memory lane. The liner 
notes come complete with a 10-
year time.line written by Herrera, as 
well as a 32-page booldet full of 
photos of the boys' antics. 

A listen to the lyrics will tell you 
that MxPx is a developing band. 
These are not just phony songwrit-
ers - they want to produce quality 
music. The songs are not all about 
chicks, getting drunlc and parties. 
Granted, some of those vices are 
there, but they also delve into life 
and how things may get better in 
the long run. 

So, when MxPx hilS the slage at 
Fall Fest, remember to keep 
Grandma out of the pit, rock hard 
and appreciate the band for its 
music. That, and the fact they have 
survived for 10 years and running.

Men's soccer: UCSD keeps lead of South Division Water polo: Tritons look 
ahead to key home matchup conrinued from page 20 to teammate Ryan Shaw, who stood 

left of the Triton goal. Shaw put the 
ball across to the front of the net, but 
there was no one there to capitalize 
and fini sh the play. 

U C D avis also had a o n e-man 
advantage over the final 10 minutes 
of the game after Triton midfielder 
David Ower received a red card, 
which forced him to leave the game. 

Despite allowing the Aggies many 
scoring chances, UCSD head coach 
Derek Armstrong credited his team's 
effort on defense. 

"That defense holds this team," 
Armstrong said. "And in the la st 10 
minutes, we were defending as a 
unit." 

With a 7 -4 overall record and a 
mark of 5-4 in the CCM, the Tritons 
have a two-point advantage over Cal 
Poly P om ona in the division stand-
ings. Going into the later stage o f this 
fall season, Armstrong and his team 
believe that winning the South 
Division is within reach. 

"That is our goal at the moment," 
Armstrong said.

Triton water polo puts away BYU-Hawaii 
UCSD's stretch of six games in five days capped by home win 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

Hopkins led the balanced-as-usual UCSD 
attack, scoring three of the eight total goals. 

After beating Princeton in SanJose, Calif., on 
Oct. 4, the UCSD men's water polo team stayed 
in Northern California over the weekend to 
compete in the NorCal tournament, which fea-
tured such top schools as Stanford, UC Berkeley, 
UCLA, Long Beach State and Pepperdine. 

On Oct. 5, the Tritons opened the NorCal 
tournament by falling to a solid Pepperdine 
team, which was coming off a big win over top-
ranked Stanford. 

"I felt like we played well enough to win," 
said Triton head coach Denny Harper. "I feel 
like you can learn something from losing and it 
was good to get some experience against a team 
at that level." 

Later that day, the Tritons had a chance to 
redeem themselves against Air Force. Led 
again by Hopkins' three goals, to go along with 
eight saves by goalie Lance Onken, UCSD 
rolled to an 11-6 victory to split its two 
Saturday games. 

On Oct. 6, the Tritons were able to keep 
some momentum. After a sluggish, low-scoring 
first half against UC Santa Barbara, UCSD 
poured it on to take down the Gauchos 9-4. 
Again, the scoring was nothing short of bal-
anced, with six different Tritons finding the 
back of the cage. Jesse Casellini managed a 
game-high three goals for UCSD. 

Duri ng the tournament, the Tritons won 
two of their four games. Then after the tourna-
ment. UCSD returned home and beat BYU-
Hawaii 10-7 on Oct. 8. 

In the 11-8 loss, UCSD had a three-goal 
deficit going into halftime and couldn't over-
come it, playing even with the Waves in both 
the third and fourth quarters. Triton Jonathan 

"We were lethargic in the first half," Harper 
said of his team. "Clark Peterson had a nice 
goal for us that got us on track." 

T he Tritons finished the weekend on a bit of 
a sour note, losing to Long Beach State after 
holding an early 5-2 lead. It was the second time 
this year that UCSD had failed to put Long 
Beach State away after leading early in the game. 

"We just can't seem to put a complete game 
together against them," Harper said. "We 
stopped counter-attacking, and that's the way 
we score." 

He added that the Tritons "get one more 
chance at them later in the season at Long 
Beach." 

After the grueling weekend, the Tritons took 
a d~erved day off on Oct. 7, and on Oct. 8 they 
completed a five-day stretch in which they played 
six games; the final game was at Canyonview 
Pool on Oct. 8 against BYU-Hawaii.

Looking ahead: UCSD improved to 13-8 this season with its 10-7 victory over BYU-Hawaii. The Tritons will 
face No.8-ranked Western Water Polo Association-rivalloyola Marymount at Canyonview pool on Oct. 11 . 

Coming off a long weekend and a day off, 
the evening matchup had all the makings of an 
upset. But the Tritons dispelled any such

Defense leads 

way in shutout 
at UC Davis

Sports Editor 

T he UCSD men's soccer team 
beat UC Davis on Oct. 6 to stay 
atop the South Division of the 
Ca lifornia Collegiate Athletic 
Association. T he Tritons' 1-0 vic-
tory over the Aggies ended a brief 
two-game losing streak. 

Freshman midtielder Matthew 
Davey took a free kick from just 
outside the penalty box in the 15th 
minute of the game. Davey used 
the kick as a chance to put the 
Tritons ahead early in the game, 
when he put the ball in the top 
right corner of the Davis goal. 

Although UCSD's defense made 
Davey's goal stand up, the Tritons 
faced several threats from the 
Aggies. With just under six minutes 
remaining in the first half, Aggie 
Jeremy Warner found a loose ball at 
his fee t in front of the net, but his 
shot went wide of the Triton goal. 

In the second half of the game, 
UC Davis held control of the ball 
fo r most of the lime. T he action 
was usually on LCD's end of the 
field and the Ag-g-Ics outshot the 
Tritons 10-4 in the half. U Davis 
had a chance late III the game when 
Aggie Peter Barrick passed it over 
the heads of the Triton defenders

Tritons protect 1-0 lead in match at Davis 

ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team traveled north to take on 
UC Davis on Oct. 6 to face the 
Aggies in an important match up. 
Coming off a disappointing loss 
two days earlier against Chico 
State, the Tritons shut out UC 
Davis 1-0. 

"That was a big game for us 
after the loss on Friday night," 
said Triton head coach Brian 
McManus. 

UCSD controlled the pace of 
play early in the game, and it 
kept the ball on the Aggies ' half 
of the field for the majority of the 
first half. 

In the game's 24th minute, 
Triton defender Christine 
Wensel passed the ball from the 
middle of the field to teammate 
Kristen Conahan, who was just 
outside the penalty box in front 
of the UC Davis goal. Aggie 
goalkeeper Christine Ogden 
came off her line to challenge the 
play, and Conahan lobbed the 
ball to open forward Shannon 
Harrelson, who headed the ball 
into the net to provide the entire 
game's scoring. 

During the second half, UC 
Davis played the role of the 
aggressor and dominated play. 
The Aggies fired 11 shots in the 
period, while the Tritons only 
managed two. 

UC Davis' best opportuni ty 
came in the 54th minute, when 
Aggie midfielder Leifa Mayers 
took a pass off a free kick and 
headed the ball wide of the 
UCSD goal. 

Late in the game, UC Davis 
challenged the Triton defense. 

With UC Davis' defense pushing 
up the field, Aggie defender 
Katie Shesgreen blasted a shot 
from 25 yards out in front of the 
Triton goal. UCSD goalkeeper 
Kami Poma jumped to Knock the 
ba 11 over the crossbar for one of 
her fou r saves during the Triton 
shutout. 

"Davis came at us with every-
thing they got, but we main-
tained our composure," 
McManus said. 

UC Davis head coach 
MaryClaire Robinson was 
pleased with her team's second-
half performance, but the two-

time defending national champi-
on Tritons pulled out a needed 
victory. 

"They got an unspectacular 
goal in the first, but a goal is a 
goal, and they made it stand up," 
Robinson said. "We made things 
happen in the second half, but 
against teams like UC San 
Diego, you have to play all 90 
minutes. " 

UCSD, which has been p'lay-
ing slightly below the standard 
that it has set for itself in the 
past, is tied with Cal Poly

President 
Bush should 
recruit from 
sports world 
From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

"S ports journalism," someone once told me, "is all about top I 0 lists 
and bathroom humor." 

"Because sPOrts fans have the 
attention span of a 6-year-old," he 
said, "and about the same intelli-
gence level, too." 

At such a sophisticated place as 
UCSD, 1 give sports fans signifi -
cantly more credit. Plus, bathroom 
humor just isn't my style. A good 
list, however, will always catch my 
eye. So, in the spirit of good sports 
journalism, I present to you the 
top 10 people from the sports 
world whom President George W. 
Bush should recruit fo r a war with 
Iraq. 

10. John Madden: With both 
Madden and Bush worki ng togeth-
er on the same "strategery," Iraq 
will end up so confused that it'H 
surrender. Madden's not the only 
Monday Night Footba ll host who 
could be a valuable weapon, 
though . Loop a tape of host 
Dennis M.iller doing color com-
mentary and Saddam may just kill 
himself. 

9. Wayne Gretzky: He 's the 
Great One. What more is there to 
say? Plus, a little support from the 
Maple Leaf country wouldn't be so 
bad,eh? 

8. Keyshawn Johnson: Send 
him into one of those weapons 
facilities, and pretty soon he won't 
take no for an answer. This is a 
man who wants to be involved in 
the plan. I wouldn't be surprised to 
see him walk up and demand, 
"Give me the damn ball, err ... 
bomb l " 

7. Venus and Serena Williams: 
These girls are flat-out scary. Plus, 
being Jehovah's Witnesses, they 
have the added experience from 
having gone into unfamiliar terri-
tory and being unwelcome. 

6. Joe Torre: Since the Yankees 
have been eliminated from the 
playoffs early this season, he's avail-
able. And as much as I hate to 
admit it, the guy has a history of 
winning. 

5. Tiger Woods: Talk about a 
propaganda tool! If he can make 
golf popular, think what he can do 
for a war effort. 

4. Shaq: The guy is huge, and 
he has a history of toppling foreign 

power~ . He beat Yugoslavia (aka 
the Sacramento Kings) in the play-
offs last year, didn't he? 

3. Mike Tyson: He's tough as 
nails and stupid as an ox - the 
perfect pedigree for a fro nt-line 
soldier in Iraq. Plus, is 'anyone 
going to be too distraught if this 
guy doesn't find his way back to 
America? 

2. Do Jackson: Bo knows base-
ball. Bo knows football. Let's just 
hope that Bo knows Suddam, 
because we're going to need some-
one to tell all of those look-alikes 
apart. 

... And the No. 1 most va lued 
recruit from the SpOTtS world to 
send to Iraq is ... 

J. Dennis Rodman: For some 
reason, 1 don't think biological 
weapon are going to phase this 
guy.
