BRIEFLY 
SIO finds sediments to 

have biomedical benefits 
For the first time, deep ocean sediments 

have been proven a significant biomedical 
resource by Scripps InslitutlOn of 
Oceanography saentists. 

One of the major discoveries made by 
the researchers was a badena called adlno-
mycetes. For more than 45 years, terrestnal 
adlnomycetes were the foundation of the 
pharmaceutical industry because of their 
ability to produce natural antibiotics, Includ-
Ing such important drugs as streptomycin, 
adlnomycin and vancomYCin. 

The new SCrIppS data provides the first 
conclusive eVidence of indigenous adlno-
mycete populations In manne sediments. 

The Scnpps sClenlists also Identified he 
strudure of a new natural produd called 
Salinosporamlde A, whICh IS a potent 
Inhibitor of cancer growth, Including human 
colon carCinoma, non-small cell lung cancer 
and breast cancer. 

The resul s of the stludy, which was led by 
William Fenlcal, director of the Cen er for 
Manne Biotechnology and BiomediCine at 
Scnpps, are published In the October 2002 
Issue of Applied and EnVIronmental 
Microbiology and the lJr.. 20 Issue of 
Angewoncfte Chemle 

Group suggests tobacco 
tax raise to help budget 

California's Tobacco Education Research 
Oversight Committee Will present recom· 
mendatlons on lan. 21 that urge legislators 
to raise the tobacco tax to help alleviate the 
state's finanCial cnsls and Increase support 
to tobacco control and education programs. 

Smo ng costs In Califomla are nearly 
S 16 billion annually, or $3,33 I per smo er 
every year, according to a report by the 
UniverSity of Califomla, San FranCISCO School 
of urslng Institute for Health & Aging. The 
heai hcare costs alone would equal one-
quaner 01 he prOjected state defiCit, accord· 
Ing ro Wendy MaJ(, co·dlrector of rhe 
Institute for Health & Aging and UCSF pro· 
fessor of health economics. 

TEROC will propose that 20 cents per pack 
be earmarked for Califomla's Proposmon 99· 
funded health educa on and research pro-
grams. According to tobacco control experts In 
the state, every dollar Invested In the Califomia 
Tobacco Control Program saves the state a 
least $3 In direct hearth care costs and anoth-
er $5 by reducing lost productMty.

Illinois governor displays his courage,

Contnbutlng Wn er 

Former illinois Gov. George Ryan 
deCided on Jan . II to commute the death 

~el1tences of all II1m3tcs on illinOIS'S death 
row He had previously Il1stituted a morato-
rium on the use of ule death penalty 111

by ~tuden~ at Norulwcstern OIversity that 
proved the IJ1nocence of 17 men wrongly 
convicted and entenced to death . Gov. 
Ryan's actions put hlln on a moral plane 
higher than most of us can ever hope to 

J~lcnd to . HIS decl~lon was 
.11 .. olutd}' the right one. 

est rabbinic thinkers and even Jesus, put out 
terms that made the death penalty almost 
impossible to carry out. But even if religion 
were the root of authority, that would not 
matter in the United States. The separation 
of church and state restricts the influence 
that religious life can have In pu blic affairs. 

Since the Supreme Court reinstated thc 
death penalty In 1976, lllinois has executed 
12 people. It is unfortunate that Gov. Ryan 
could not act sooner to prevent his ~tate from 
committing th.i s act at all . The government,

executIon 
Ryan not justified in overturning 

death sentences en masse 
By CLAIRE J. VANNEnt 

OPlnton Editor 

Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan has 
been the subject of polarized responses late-
ly. 

On the one hand, his deciSIOn on Jan . II 
to commute the death sentences of all 167 
llIinols death row inmates has garnered 
praise from leaders like Desmond Turu. 
Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II -
and a obel Peace Prize nomination . 

On the other hand, many of Ryan 'S crit-
ics - and there are a lot of them 

have, and they are detrimental 10 illinOiS and 
almost certainly contrary to the anti -dcJth 
penalty movement. 

Ryan, a long supporter of the deaul 
penalty, began to change his mind in 1999, 
when a death row inmate was exonerated 
and saved from a wrongful death . The gov-
ernor ubsequently placed a moratontlln on 
executions in the state and encouraged 

investigation~ into the death penalty. lI e was 
heralded by death penalty opponents as an 
open.minded reformer. Then thiS: 

Ryan said in a jan. 13 Interview on C BS, 
"I had been encouraged ... to

labeled him a self-interested and 
corrupt polttlclan who~e II th-

Students for Justice gtwes another side 

UJS not involved in 
flyer defacement 

Editor: 
I was shocked and upset to 

read about the defacement of a 
student organization's flyers. I 
1V.lI1t to publicly state that the 
UnlOlI of Jewish Students was in 
no way involved in thiS deface-
ment. Rega rdless of the feelings 
of our organization about the 
spea kers advertised on the fl yers, 
UJS recogni zes and suppOrts the 
rights of all srudents to protected 
free speech, and would not act in 
any way to impinge upon those 
rights. 

I\dditionally, the designation 
of this incident as a "hate crime" 
or a "hate incident" is erroneous. 
Whde the defacement certainly 
was inappropriate and wrong, the 
Jewi h star is not a hateful sym-
bol, Just as the drawing of a cross 
on 'I mila r flyers could not be seen 
as hateful. Furthermore, the defi-
nition of a hate crime is a crimc 
that "was motivated, in wholc or 
in part, by the victim 's race, eth-
lI ici ry, rehgion, sexua l orientation 
or physica l or mental disa hility 
... " The Students for Justice is not 
a reli gIOUS or ethnic organization. 
The events advertised on these 
fl yers were of a political nature, 
and thus the defacement of them 
ca nnot be viewed as being moti-
va ted by hate against a religious

The televi,ions report. The 
newspapers report. The radio 
reports. Yet, even with ~uch mass 
coml1luniC<ltion and technology, 
a large portion of the public 
remains unaware, obltvious to 
trenchant problems that plal,rue 
people daily, all over the world. 

\Vhat I have always consid-
ered wonderful about the univer-
sity is the studcnt activism enthu-
siastically publici:wd for a partic-
ular cause. It I a comfort to 
know that people take a stand for 
economic justice and that culrur-
a I groups display their peoples' 
history with the intent of educat-
ing others. While UCSD docs 
remain on u1e quiet side in com-
parison with other campuses, it 
sees itS share of activism: II1for-
mative tables on Library Walk, 
rallies, protests and of course 
informative lectures and forums 
that have Indeed increased 
awarene s on worthy tOpics. 

I support UC D's student 
activi,t organization, Students 
for justice, which has already 
started off this wimer quarter 
with threc informative guest Icc-
turers that addressed the Israeli-
Pales tinian criSIS. Students for 
justice feds passionately ahout 
raising aware ness on critical 
world i~sues, and It is thi~ Wrt of 
ardor that will lowly uccecd in 
catching the attention of sru-
dentS.

Pro: Executions lack deterrent effect 
conrinued from paRe 4 

Diego for the murder of Danielle 
van Darn . 

The nited States i~ the only 
major we,tern industrial power that 
sti ll employs the u e of the death 
penalty. The use of It puts US in 
league with the cOlllmunist People's 
Republic of China and Iran, a mem-
ber of Presidem Bush's so-called 
"Axis of Evil." The use of capital 
punishment strains relations with 
Canada and western Europe, since 
dleir laws do not allow many of 
them to extradite a criminal to 
another country if there is a po i-
bility that they will be executed. 
During the height of the militaryi; 
search for Osama bin Laden in 
Afghanistan, CNN reported that if 
he were to be captured, bin Laden 
would be better off rurning himself 
over to a British unit than to an 
American one, and in that way guar-
antee that he could not be executed. 

The Eighth Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States 
dictates that "cruel and unusual 
punishments" shall not be inflicted . 
There have been many arguments 

over the years that the death penal-
ty is both cruel and un usual. 
Various methods of execution have 
been employed, from hanb';ng to 
tiring squads to the so-called "more 
humane" methods of gas and ledlal 
injection. These methods arc con-
sidered more advanced because 
they kill efficiently, ensuring the 

" The United States is the 
only major western 

industrial power tlu1t stiU 
employs the use of the 

death penalty. " 
victim dies qUickly and presumably 
causing him less pain. 

Other methods, like the electric 
chair, have been dispensed with and 
are considered cruel and unusual 
due to events like the disastrous 
execution of Pedro Medina in 
Florida in 1997. Wimcsse report-

ed that fl ames shot out from behind 
Medina's mask during the execlI-
tion, and that he continued to 
breath aJ1d twitch for several min-
utes following the electric jolt 
being sent through his body. There 
is no question that tim kllld of tor-
ture is cruel and unusual. 

But thanks to Gov. Ryan' very 
appropriate and brave action;, 
there will be no Pedro 1edina ill 
Illinois. Instead of being strapped 
into a chair and ha,ring the life 
shocked out of him, a criminal 
would instead sit in a cell, awaiting 
the day when he can die on his own 
and face whatever god he believe 
in and whatever afterlife he 
believes awaits him. Every statc in 
the Union hould follow Illinois' 
lead and abolish the death penalty, 
starting right hel c in California 
and in Texas, the state with the 
most executions since 1976. Guv. 
Ryan's actions are commendable, 
and I applaud his bravery. \Ve 
would be better off as a society if 
the death penalty were left to the 
history books, instead of current 
events. 

Con: Commutations undermine state law 
conrmued from page 4 

I t would have been far more 
fair for Ryan to encourage some-
one more qualified - perhaps the 
death penalty task force he created 
in 1999 - to review these ca es 
individually and thoroughly and 
then give him recommcndations 
as to which were suspect and could 
perhaps deserve clemency. ",ras It 
the pre ure of time that pushed 
Ryan into a move that spits in the 
face of the assuredly flawed but 
nonetheless supreme lIlinOI jus-
tice sy tem' Or was it, as many of 
the governor's critics have 
charged, purely a selfish move 
aimed at glossing the sca ndal-
plagued legacy he's made for him-
self? 

Ryan said in an interview with 
PR's "All Things Considered" 

that his goal wa:; "to fix the sys-

tern," which he charges is corrupt 
and irrevocably flawed. But how 
does pardoning these inmates fix 

" That Ryan would so 
shockingly seek to under, 
mine the laws and voters 
of Illinois sets a dangerous 

bar far gubematarial 
power,mongering. " 

anything in 1l1inois? It's true that a 
renewed swirl of debate about the 
death penalty ha appeared since 
Ryan 's announcement, but It:!> tone 
is hardly cooperative and conciLia-

tory. Nothing is being accom-
plished toward Ryan's stated goal 
- a pro-death penalty governor is 
taking the reins in Ulinois, and like-
ly the outrage over Ryan's unprece-
dented move will create a backJash 
against any anti-death penalty 
movements in the state. 

That Ryan would so hockll1gly 
seek to undermine the laws 3I1d 
voters of Illinois sers a dangerous 
bar for gubernatorial power-mon-
gering. The Start JOlll71al-Rrgmcr of 
Springfield, 01., wrote, "Ryan did 
not want to be governor of lIIinois; 
he wanted to be king." The trlllh is 
that a man can be a tyrant whcther 
he order a hundred beheadi ngs or 
stops a hundred, so long a the 
exe utive order goe.~ contrary to 
the democratic system upon which 
our country is supposed to be 
founded . 

Justice: Biased media does a disservice 
corUinued from page 5 

audience continued to learn and to 
reflect on the information present-
ed to them. Afterward, tudents 
mingled with one anomer, often 
exchangmg their own personal 
thoughts on the issue. 

According to an Diego State 
University profe sor Farid Abdel-
Nour, one of the main reasons that 
there ceases to be peace is the 
"Jack of communication and dia-
logue" between different parties, 
which he explained at his talk on 
the "Peace Process." It was great 
to see the Union of JeWish 

tudents at the Students for 
Justice events last week, learning 
more about the Palestinian side of 
the Story, and I hope to see the 
reverse if U]S hosts any informa-
tIVe sessIOns. It is through these 
Intellectual mediums that we 
begin to better understand the 
pohueal and social dynamics 

around us and better understand 
one another. 

Yet, it is usually only the people 
who already know something about 
the topic being presented that end 
up frequenting these outreach 
events. The average person may 
not care to learn since they feel 
already ignorant of the matter 
being presented, or they may care 
to learn but do not want to put 111 
the "extra effort" to actually attend 
any event. 

So this remains the main ohsta-
c1e that Students for Justice, along 
with many odler 5nldenr org-dni7.a-
tions, encounters. The dilemma is 
sparking enough Interest In stu-
dents. As Shaiq said, "Even If one 
person comes out learning Just one 
new thing, that would be great." 
And that is what I cncourage all of 
us to do. Our university years are 
the time for us to take advantage of 
all of the available resources . 

Students arc working hard to bring 
attention to the truths that are not 
reported in the media . They are 
working hard 10 bring justice [0 a 
certain cause and to a certain peo-
ple. 

I am heartened to know that 
tudents for Justice will now be 

focusing on other trouble SpOts 
around the globe and set aside 
Israel and Palestine, in hopes of 
raising more awareness and attract-
IIlg new people. \Nc need to :;tcp 
outside !lIe box and take a look 
around. JUSt at a brief glance: 
There is war in Chechnya, a Illa~ ­
sive famine in Africa, massacres 111 
India, uproars in VcncZlIcb lnd 
Columbia and a rising revoluuon ill 
Iran. tudents for Justice has Itlany 
areas that it can covcr, and I 
encourage all of us to attend at least 
one event with the true Intent of 
coullng out bcltcr understa nding 
the Sltuaoon.

Bush's EPA policy not negligent Basically: Women prepare 
more for shopping trips Nine states sue administration, ignore n ew law's benefits 

By DUSTIN FRELIeH 
Staff Writer 

Nine states are suing the Bush 
administration for what they see as 
negligent environmental policy by 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency that would relax emission 
upgrade standards for industrial 
buslI1csses. Connecticut, Maine, 
.\1aryland, Massachusetts, New 
Ilampshire, New Jersey, New 
York, Rhode Island and Vermont 
are alllong those suing, and believe 
that the EPA under Bush control is 
pushing business over environ-
mental policy. 

The new policy went into effect 
Jan. I, and alters a previous law 
that made it mandatory, when 
engaging in any facility improve-
ments, no matter how large or 
small, to require plant-wide modi-
fications that would meet stringent 
new EPA rel,ruJations on emission. 
The new law changes the demands 
to apply only to large-scale renova-
tions, not smaller projects like 
"routine maintenance." The previ-
ous wording of the law did just 
that: made it mandatory for entire 
plant modifications even when 
undergoing rouone improvements. 

The benefi t to industry is that 
facilities can now upgrade without 
being forced to make further 
unwanted modifications. 

But as well as being pro-indus-
try, the new piece of legislation is 
also pro-environment. VVhen 
plants are forced to pay for 
unwanted upgrades (under the old 
statute), they are less likely to 
undergo any partial environmen-
tal improvements which would 
trigger, by law, modifications of 
the entire pia nt, the logic being 
that facilities with only enough 
funding or inclination to make 
minor pollution control improve-
ment will abstain from any at all. 

The previou policy clearly 
negate any potential for environ-
mental benefit. While facilities 
that have the funds to indulge 
themseh'es in a major renovation 
would do so withollt EPA interfer-
ence, those without the capital to 
satisfy auxiliary adjusonents, but 
that do have the means to engage 
in only partial upgrade, would 
have 110 incentive to do so out of 

\ 

NATIONAL 
fear of being forced to pay for 
plant-wide restructuring. 

When a plant has only two 
options - to upgrade all facilities 
to strict EPA standard (at enor-
mous financial cost) or to do noth-
ing- itdoesn'ttake a rocket scien-
tist to fil.'llre out what path will be 
chosen, rightly or wrongly. The 
result is that plants would opt out of 
any pollution-reducing improve-
ments to escape the penalizing 
nature of the previous EPA rule. 

But while tile new law fixes 
this, the nine states have brought 
litigation against thc EPA under a 
cerrain air of idiocy: not meeting 
stricter pollution emission stan-
dards at all is better than satisfy1l1g 
a few requirements. 

Taking their case to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals on Dec. 3 I, 
2002, the states charge that the 
"new source review" rule - which 
changed the language of the law 
to no longer apply to routine 
maintenance but to major plant 
overhauls - contributes to the 
negligence of the Bush adminis-
tration to effectively deal with 
environmental issues. 

However, the new rule easily 
induees keener improvements in 
efficacy and environmental friend-
liness. But the policy is an easy tar-
get because of the appearance that 
it has discounted environmental 
concerns; it leads the common 
observe r to put heart before mind, 
concluding through emotion that 
the policy is in the wrong, rather 
than determining through reason 
that, although not perfect, the pol-

icy is the best method to achieve 
that which needs achieving. 

Opining on the matter, 
Democratic Senator Hi lIary 
Clinton said, "The administra-
tion's rules are clearly not what 
Conb'TeSS intended when it passed 
the Clean Air Act." Would that be 
the part that encourages more or 
less environmenta l pollution on 
the part of mdustry? 

Takmg a page from Senator 
Clinton's playbook, ew York 
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer 
said the new rules should be con-
sidered an "assault on the Clean 
Air Act and [we need to] continue 
to fight to achieve the goals that 
the law intended." 

I must concede that it was a sly 
move on the part of the opposi-
tion to prop up a Clean Air Act 
straw man, linking the new legis-
lation as being pro-environmental 
destruction . Accusations are 
cheap. And those such as these are 
meant for nothing more than 
sound bytes on the nightly news, 
where tho e unfamiliar with the 
rea oning behind the new policy 
can have free reign to yell at their 
television, cursing the day Bush 
assumed the role of president. 

How doe Bush' policy gut the 
lean Air Act? By making it more 

efficient? Thankfully for the suing 
states and their supporter, thats a 
question they will never have to 
answer in our age of simple accu-
sations without explanations. Say 
whatever you want. We all know 
that nine times out of 10, you will 
not be called on it. And even in 
the case that you are, we \\~ll not 
ask for an apology since your heart 
- not your mind - was in the 
right place. 

Having the ability to improve 
pollution controls without being 
penalized for doing so is a 
recourse for action we must give 
to our industries. Without such an 
option, we deter them &om mak-
ing any advances in the name of 
environmentalism in the first 
place. This law should be praised 
by environmentalists. Instead, it is 
complete anathema to those who 
wish to pursue emotion-based 
politics over substance, chastising 
Bush because of nothing else than 
that he is, well, Bush. 

continued from page 5 
In the beginning, before the Lady 
Ric had been invented, the women 
were the gatherers and the men 
were the hunters. 

Grocery shopping, I thlllk we 
can all agree, is more of a gathenng 
than a hunting activity. Women 
don't shop for their husbands 
because men Simply don't have ome 
for it; we do It because men do not 
have the DNA reqUired to find the 
condiments aisle. It's that Simple. 

Men are supposed to be doing 
hunter-type things, like locating 
and seducmg hot chicks, running 
down the other team If they have 
the ball and locating the b~t coun-
tries to bomb. Clearly, all of these 
activities would fall under the 
"hunter" category. 

So obviously, when you send a 
man - who is 

" 

men, on the other hand, wouldn't 
blink an eye if the shopping carr 
equivalent of Hitler came marching 
down on h,s cart. VVhat does he 
earc? He needs a damn toothbrush! 

So Ethan Just goes about hl~ 
mcrry way - without hiS ~hopping 
cart - so that he can (and ,Igam, 
this would be an evolutIOn thll1g) 
hunt for It later. I don't thlllk mcn 
would find shopplIlg nearl} as hC.lr-
able if they couldn't play hlde-.lIld-
seck with their carts. 

Once Ethan had chosen 1m 
toothbrush, I discovcred we had 
another problem. I Ie had /10 II/rll 
what else he needed to buy . • 'ow, If 
you're like me (also known as slight-
ly anal-retentive), you go in WIth J 
list that is alphabetically ordered for 
your added shopping convenience. 
Obviously, you don't have to be thiS 

genetically predis-
po ed not to gather 
- into a grocety 
store to locate spe-
cific items olhtr 
than liquor and 
chips, you are going 
to have a problem. 

OK, so let's take 
an in-depth, specif-
ic look at some of 

A woman would 
never heartlessly 

abandon her shop, 
ping cart like that. " 

scary to go groccry 
shopping prepared, 
but most women 
WIll have some idea 
of what they need . 
Women know that 
shopping is like hat-
tie: You go in pre-
pared. do as much 
damage as posslhle, 
and get the hell out 
before the enemy 

these problems - no matter how 
painfuJ it may be. 

So I'm grocery shopping with 
this guy, whom we shall call Ethan, 
because it sounds a lot like ms real 
name, which is Evan. The first 
thing I noticed was that Evan - er, 
Etha.n - only knew he was actual-
ly in the grocery store for one 
thing: a toothbrush. 

In the case of the Vons we were 
shopping in, the dental accessories 
were set off in a little corner apart 
&om the actual food products . So, 
using his naturally good sense of 
direction. Ethan went over there to 
Jocate the cheapest possible tooth-
brush. fn Ethans mind, this did not 
require him to acrually take hi 
shopping cart with him; he just left 
it in the middle of the supermarket, 
completely unattended. 

A woman would never heartless-
ly abandon her shopping cart like 
that. This is because she usually 
stores important personal items in 
the car t, such as purses and small 
children. Women guard their carts 
like there's no tOmorrow; while 

has time to call a pnce check. 
I spent over an hour aimle:;sly 

walking around Vons with a Illan 
who is otherwise reasonably intelli-
gent and self-aware. And we didn't 
even go from aisle to aisle like nor-
mal people; there was no rational 
basis for the way we moved around 
that Vons. Actually, maybe there 
was. I bet that if you took the square 
root of your age plus the year YOll 
were born in and then systematical-
ly divide by twO alw' mulnpl},ng by 
seven - lhal would be the order of 
the aisles we went down. 

So basica\\y, al1.er Bush is done 
passing Juws chat infringe un our 
constitutional nghts, he rra/Iy need:; 
to make it illegal for people with 
penises to enter grocery stores. 
Because this country needs to get 
its prioritie in order. 

This columnist would be really sur-
prised If anyone e-malled her at 
csklar@ucsd.edu, but should you 
do so, understand Ihat II tS at your 
own peril.

in an area located away from daily 
traffic, it makes it easier for 
thieves to hide and commit the 
crime." 

UCSD covers roughly 12,000 
acres, with 15,000 parking spaces in 
more than 80 parking lots. There 
are 27 sworn officers, 16 residen t 
security officers and 35 cOf11f11uniry 
ervice officers on patrol in a 24-

hour period. 
"It's a daunting task," O'Dell 

said . "J Iowever, th e police depart-
ment is taking steps to address the 
if11media te problem." 

Although they could not elabo-
rate on their plans, campus police 
are advising ca r owners to person-
ally take steps to deter thieves. 
One method is what law enforce-
ment calls "hardening the target." 
This includes making sure to roll 
up all windows and lock all doors. 
Also, the use of alarm systems and 
ki ll switches ca n he lp prevent 
theft. 

"Thc goal is to make it harder 
for a thief to steal your vehicle," 
O'Dell sa id. "If you make it 0 dif-
ficult and force the individual to 
take more rime, the thief will move 
on to another target. You may have 
a damaged car, but at lea t you'll 
sti ll have a car." 

Products such as the C lub can 
also serve as effective deterrents, 
O'Dell said. 

"When my car wa s broken 
into, I had the Club on," said 
sophomore Heidi Peterson, 
whose Honda Civic was vandal-
ized in ovember 2002 at East 
Parking. 

"I locked my doors and rolled 
up my windows, but they found 
some way in," Peterson sa id. "The

being stolen." 
Police are also asking students 

and faculty to be aware of their sur-
roundings when entering a parking 
lot and to report any suspicious 
people or events. 

"If you see somethi ng suspi-
cious, report it immediately," 
O'Dell said. "We'd much rather go 
Ollt and check on something that 
ends up to be nothing than to go 
out and find that the crime had 
already occurred." 

At this time, the police depart-
ment is not excluding anyone as a 
potential suspect. They believe the 
thieves can be anyone, even stu-
dents. 

"We have arrested students in 
the past on related charges," 
O'Dell said. "I would not be sur-
prised to find snldents behind some 
of these thefts ." 

If your car is stolen, the police 
are advising the public to immedi-
ate ly report it by calling (858) 
534-HELP or by finding a call 
box, which are usuall y located 
within the vic iniry of the parking 
lot, and report the crime. Police 
recommend students to have 
information about their vehicles 
available. 

This information will be 
entered into a nationwide database 
that will alert officers of the status 
of any vehicle. 

"The sooner you report the 
incident, the less likely the vehicle 
will be outside the immediate area 
and the more likely you will get ir 
back," O'Dell sa id . 

Questions concerning auto 
th eft and rypes of anti-theft 
devices can be answered by calling 
the UCSD Police Department's 
Crime Prevention Office at (858) 
534-3644.

said. "That's our biggest turnout 
ever." 

Brady said it was also an 
imponant event because it is the 
only event where the Preuss 
School, the Medical Center and 
the main campus come together 
for a collaborative event. 

Many groups were represent-
ed within the UCSD delegation. 
Among them were the Cross 
Cultural Center, S.O.L.O., the 
African-American Student 
Union, each of the six colleges 
and UCSD Healthcare workers. 

Stephanie Akpa, a Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore, 
came to the parade with the 
AASU. However, for Akpa, the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. parade 
was also a matter of personal tra-
dition. 

"I'm from San Diego, so I've 
been to the parade every year 
since the eighth grade," Akpa 
said. "And I've participated every 
year since the ninth grade. I 
remember eeing the UCSD 
group then, and it was good to see 

that they were so interested and 
taking pride in the communiry." 

Edwina Welch, the director 
of the Cross Cultural Center, 
sees the parade as an opportunity 
for students from di fferent orga-
nizations to get to know each 
other, perpetuating the same sort 

" What other UCSD 
event gets this much 
cross,participatian? " 

- Edwina Welch, Cross Cultural 
Center Diredor 

of cultural and ethnic mlxmg 
lauded by Martill Luther lUng, 
Jr. 

"I think there are few oppor-
tunities when we all come 
together through our colleges or 
collectives where we all still get 
to retain our individual identi-
ties, but at the same rime we're 

still rogethr.r as UCSD," Welch 
said . "Students get to see each 
other here who otherwise might 
not. What other UCSD event 
gets this much cross-participa-
tion?" 

For Jessie Sims of the UCSD 
Pep Band, the most enjoyable 
part of parade was providing a lit-
tle light-hearted music. 

"1 came to be with the band," 
Sims said . "It's a lot of fUll to play 
for this crowd." 

Duane Wright, a member o f 
the Alpba Phi Alpha Fraterniry, 
Inc., which organizes the . an 
Diego parade, said that participa-
tion was thriving at the City level 
as well. 

"We have over 100 different 
organizations and about 2,000 
people in the parade," Wright 
said. "There are probably Jbolf( 
10,000 watching, too." 

\Nright's fraternity also choos -
es a king and queen for the parade 
from local high schools. This 
year, Donald Addison and SllJIlOn 
Belle held the honor Jnd will be 
given scholarship for college.

On the 30th 
anniversary of 
Roe v. Wade, 

America revisits 
the abortion 

Issue 
any people do not remember a time M when abortion was illegal, but Maggie Myers, a former nurse and counselor at Planned Parenthood, remembers it 
all tOO well. 

"When I was in nurses' training at County 
Hospital, which is where UCSD hospital is now, I 
was assigned for one of my rotations to the infect-
ed OB/GYN ward," Myers said. "That ward h3d 
23 beds in one big room and almost every bed was 
full of women who had illegal abortions." 

Myers aided many women - some whose lives 
could be saved and some who died . One woman's 
story stands out in Myers memory. 

"A patient that 1 particularly remember was a 
young woman - she was 24 with four clllidren," 
Myers said. "When she got pregnant for the fifth 
time, she gave herself an abortion with an umbrel -
la rod. [She] forced it up through her uterus and 
her liver and stomach up into her lung, and T took 
care of her for a wee~ until he died. 1 can still see 
her." 

In 1948, when Mycrs was working as a nur e, 
most forms of cOlltraception were al 0 illegal, and 
the options of preventing an unwantcd pregnancy 
werc lim to none. After marrying and givi ng birth 
to twO chIldren, Myers found herself in the same 
situation as many of thc women III hcr hospital 
ward. 

" I knew that I didn't want more than two chil-
drcn, and I got pregnam a couple of years after 
having my second chi ld," Myers said. "1 was using 
a method of birth control which failed. So when I 
got pregnant I asked my doctor, 'Could you help 
me?' and he sa id, 'I can't do anything, but talk to 
my nurse.' She gave me the names of three doctors 
in Tijuana. My husband took the day off of work 
and we took money out of the bank and down we 
went to TIjuana." 

South of the border, Myers found a doctor who 
performed abortions in a secluded warehouse in 
the bac~ of his office. Without any anesthetic, in a 
corner of a TIjuana W2rehouse, Myers held back 
any sounds of pain and got her abortion. Myers' 
story, while certainly not unique, is just one story 
of the complex issue of abortion. 

The history of abortion in America is a long and 
complex tale. It is surprising to many tha t abortion 
was not always illegal before Roe v. Wade. 

"We didn't have that concept, per sc," said M .E. 
Stephens, a San Diego anorney who teache 
UCSO \ "Gender Equality and the Law" class. 
"The first thing in b:rR1S of childbearing that was 
iIIepi were certain forms of contraception for 
women." 

The late 19th cc:nrury Comstock Laws out-
lawed contraception as well as abortion deeming 
them forms of obscenity. In the 19 10s, during dle 
suffrage movemen t, many women began to speak 
out against the obscenity laws. One of the most 
oumpoken was a maternity nurse from New York's 
lower east side named Margaret Sanger.

Roe: New attitudes towards

cont;nuedfrom page 10 
anger, who would later go on 

to found Planned Parcnthood, 
witnessed the results of illegal 
abortions. She traveled to Europe 
to learn about contraccptive 
methods; shc then published in 
her ncwsletter, "The Women 
Rebel." Sangcr was thrown in jail 
for the information dispcnsed in 
thi ncwslcltcr, but the damage to 
the Comstock Laws had alrcady 
bcen Jonc. 3nd thc beginnings of 
a bIrth control re"olutlon wcrc on 
Il\ way. 

"Thc Seneca Falb womcn's 
nj()vctllctlt that eventually led to 
the right to vore - that was kind 
of the gcnesis for a change," 
Stephens said. 

By the t960s, America was 
changing at a rapid pacc, and the 
government's views on regulating 
sexuJlity and reproduction began 
to be reconsidered. It was nOt 
until the 1965 landmark decision 
of Crmvold v. COllllfC/J(1/1, howev-
er, that married couples gained 
the right to use contraception. 

"By the 1960s, it stopped mak-
ing eme for the government to 
intrude into an individuals rela-
tionship in that way," Stephens 
saiJ. 

As clle feminist movement pro-
gressed, women's autonomy over 
their bodie became a central 
issue. Radical branches of femi -
nism that grew mainly out of the 
1960s New Left movement felt 
that thc right to abortion was piv-
otal to female independence. T he 
spark that Sanger et with her 
move toward legalized contracep-
tion was about to become a fire 
that is still burning today. 

The country, pre-Rot v. Wadr, 
the landmark 1973 Supreme 
Court decision that lega lized 
abortion, varied from pia e to 
place. 

"Thc l:iws really have been dif-
ferent in different places," 

tcphens aid . "Women were 
IIsing other mean s of obtaining 
abortions becau e it required a 
thlllg like parental consent or 
spousal consent." 

orilla N. Me orver, bCller 
known as "Jane Roe," sought and 
W.IS unable to obtain a legal abor-
lion in Tcxas. I ler life was not in 
danger, and thus «Roe" was forced 
to have a child, which she later 
gave up for adoption. I lowever, 
"Roe" did go on to be orne the 
lead plallltiff in a class-action law-

suit that Sara Weddingron and 
Linda Coffce, two lawyers fresh 
Out of 1.lw school, brought beforc 
the Supreme Court. 

n Jan. 22, 1973, cllC U.S. 
Supreme Coun declarcd the Texas 
law prohibiting an abortion except 
for the purpo e of saving a 
woma/l'~ life unconstin.tional by a 
vote of 7-2. The decision invall -
J.ncd abortion laws in 4/\ statcs . 

"Essentially, it was a ca c that 
WJ~ designed to protect a women's 
right to choose III the face of a 
very restrictivc Texas 1.lw," 
Stephens sa id. " \Vhat the COurt 
did "'.1, they made up a new s tan-
dartl. \Vhat they looked at was thc 
Intltvldual's imerest versus the 
!.{;:nc'!) inlcr~l." 

The case was actually argueJ 
twice . On the first try, 
\Veddltlgton began her argulllents 
III frollt of seven, /lot nine justices 
because twO of tile justiccs had 
recently retired. \ Veddington was 
poised in her argument, but failcd 
to pcg her case in a specific consti-
tutional provision. I [er opponent, 
Jay Floyd, also got off to a less-
than-eloquent start. Hc began, 
"[t'S an old joke, but when a man 
argues against twO beautiful ladies 
like thi , they are going to have 
the last word." The justices wcre 
not amused. The court, now 
including two new justices, 
William H. Rchnquist and Lewis 
F. Powell Jr., decided to hear sec-
ond arguments for Roe. 

Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
crafted the decision that did not 
specify a constitutionally guaran-
teed right, but rather based the 
decision on the right to privacy 
protected by the due process 
clause ulldcr the 14th 
Amendment. U ltimately, the 
court was enforci ng a right that 
the Cotlstin.tion Jid not specify. 

Contrary to popular belief, Ro~ 
only legalizcd abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy. 
The court went on to state that in 
the interest of protecting a 
woman' health, states may restrict 
but not prohibit abortions in the 
second three months of pregnan-
cy. In the last three months f 
pregnancy, states llIay regulate -
or even prohibit - abortIons to 
protect the life of the ferus, except 
when medical judgmell! deter-
mine that an abortion i neces-
sary to ave the life of the mother.

"My name was Salmon, like the

December 6, 1973." 

With these first hnes, A1iee

"The Lovely Bones." It IS told 
through the eye of SUSie, who I 
alrcady III heaven after bClng mur-

nlrc of heaven is not :1 typical one, 
bur a world unique [0 each per,on 's 
desires. Though it merely serves as 
a backdrop to Susie's musings, it is 
one of the most inrerestmg ele-
ments in the book. 

usic finds herself in the high 
school she dreamed of anendmg 
her next year on earth, whcre she 
meets a girl named Holly whom 
she end up living with in tlleir 
ideal home, a duplex. Though 
heaven had year-round pepper-
mint ice cream and Seventeen 
magazines for textbooks, it still 
could not give Susie what he most 
wanted: to be allowed to grow up. 

Susie decides to observe the 
world she left behind ince she 
"came to believe that if I watched 
closely, and desired, I might change 
the lives of those I loved on earth. n 
She sees her parents retreat into 
themselves due to the horror that 
has taken over their lives; her father 
reaching out to those he loves while 
her mother pulls away from the 
family she can no longer handle. 

Her younger sister Lindsey 
must brace up against the sympa-
thy of countless adults and Susie 
watches willie he attcmpts to not 
lose herself through the [oss of a 
sister. Though too young to ever 
truly understand usic's death, her 

brother Buckely I the only one , he 
succeeds in reaching. hc looks on 
longingly as her fricnds try to go 
on with their lives. 

The narrative style makes the 
novel engaging, since it blends the 
experiences of her family before the 
loss with the day-by-day events of 
their lives as they continue to wor!': 
through their grief. It is this combi· 
nation that gives a full picture of the 
impact of death in a person's life. 

Sebolds novel is truly about 
how a family mourns and heals 
after an unimaginable loss. It is this 
healing that is the heart of the 
story, and through Susie's vi ion, 
she explores all the characters 
equally, relating their motivations, 
actions and reactions in a clear and 
believable way. It is a fresh outloo!.: 
that is insightful anti heartening to 
all who have lost someone in 
death . "The Lovely Bones" is 
about restoration after heartbreak

Is there still a place for 
patriotism? 

Jessica 
Lingel 

Despite problems, the United States 
is still a great country 

For a long time, I was not that 
big on patriotism. Shonly after I 
became interested in politics (which 
was preny carlyon in a family that 
had me reci ting the presidents in 
chronological order as a require-
ment for leaving the dinner table), 
it seemed to me that the intelligent 
people in the world of politics were 
always criticizing everything U.S. 
politicians said or did. 

Even later, when I realized that 
the only thing that a lot of political 
journalists do is criticize, the gusty 
patriotism that I encountered was 
always entangled in catch phrases 
like "American values" and the 
"American dream," concepts and 
ideals that I had trouble relating 
with anything concrete. 

I wa growing up in a world 
where politicians had a bad name. 
They lied, cheated, did anything to 
get ahead, and could be bought and 
sold at the bidding of anyone with a 
deep enough wallet. Being proud of 
America seemed an endorsement of 
the people running it, and there 
wa nor a lor of rea on to be back-
ing people who had candals fol -
lowing them right and left. 

And of coune, there is a huge 
amount of historica l baggage. 
There i slavery, internment camps, 
sexism, discrimination and a con ri-
turion that has slaves listed as 
three-fifths of a person. More 
recently, there is the invasion of 
dozens of South American coun-
tries for reasons that are at best 
ql1est:ionable. Being proud of those 
,cllons would seemi ngly make 
someone a bigot, a racist or simply 
a jerk. I like to think of myself a 
someone who fall into tho e cate-
goric as lirtle as possible. 

So there I wa , feeling Jaded and 
cynical about politIcs and ubse-
quendy bitter tOward those who 
could not sec that pa triotIsm was an 
ignorant waste of uille. ,\10st of Illy 
)leers felt the same way. That kind of 
attirude was tested in my lim col-
lege poliucal science course in 
which we were asked to rank our-
selves on a ~cale of one to five in a 

number of different areas. The pro-
fessor asked how passionate we were 
regarding different issues and to 
rank our interest in politics, as well 
as how left or right we were - with 
conservative as one and liberal as 
five. I was, predictably, a five. Then 
he asked us to rank our patriotism, 
one being low and five being high. I 
hesitated, then put down a two. 

Bur it did nor feel right. After 
all, I had been out of the cou ntry. I 
had seen the poverty of third-world 
countries, as well as the sheer polit-
ical corruption of certain European 
nations, yet surely patriotism was 
not derived from disliking aspects 
of other countries. Besides, there is 
poverty and corruption within U.S. 
borders that may be better hidden 
but cannot be ignored. 

Like no small number of politi -
cal i sues, what evenrually changed 
my mind was a discussion with my 
dad . One rught I asked him if he 
considered himself to be patriotic. 
Besides being a very intelligent guy, 
my dad worked in the state depart-
ment with the Foreign Service for 
years, rwo of which were spenr 
working in West Germany in the 
early I 980s. Asking him was more 
than asking someone I re pected; it 
was a king the opinion of omeone 
who had the opporrunity to see 
American values from a variety of 
angles and perspectives. 

"I consider myself very patrlotlc," 
he said. "Overall, I'm very proud of 
tile actions of America over the past 
200 years.H I Ie went on to talk about 
the founding principles ami how 
many of them have endured incc 
the inception of the Constitution, 

launched into an explanation of 
early foreign policies, and di cussed 
the way that Americans feel con-
nected to each other through values 
as opposed to herit1ge. Suddenly 
being patriotic did not seem like 
such an awl.-ward thing anymore. 

Lest I seem insensitive, I do not 
want to imply that the Bill of 
Rights somehow nullifies the hor-
ror of slavery. I am not tryi ng to 
argue that the do-it-yourself atti-
rude of America cancels out the 
racism and sexis m of the past (and 
present). I am certainly not proud 
of all Anlerican actions. Conversely, 
I would hesitate to respect any kind 
of patriotism based on the blind 
assumption d13t American actions 
are always right and unquestion-
able. But as a result of that conver-
aoon, I have come to look at patri -

otism differendy. I have learned to 
look at things I took for granted. 

There are a lot of things in 
American politics that anger me, 
from lavery to the war on terror-
ism. But patriotism and accepting 
those actions no longer seem mutu-
ally exclusive. It is a country based 
on ideas of equality and justice on 
the freedom of peech, religion. 
expression and the right of the peo-
ple to petioon their government for 
a redress of grievanccs. It is a cOLIn-
try that allows a huge amOllnt of 
immigration and, to an extent much 
larger than most, allows those 
immigrants to gain citi7~nship . 

Even if those founding ideals 
arc sometimes violated or twisted, 
and evcn if this cOllllrry has com-
mitted terrible acts of devas tation 
and horror, I thmk I can conSider 
myself patriotic. I think I can 
accept the idea that even though 
there are people In powcr that I 
dislike and are actions being t.lken 
that I find ohjectionolhle, I sti Il11.1\<: 
rights and freedoms th.1t :lrt' 
adrlllrable overall. Regardless of 
mfractions and IIlfnngclllcnrs of 
those fOlllllhng Ide,l ls , the concept 
of liberty lives on. The fJct is that 
this is a country III which It i, worth 
struggling to find patflOU.,IIl . 

Debate: 30 years later the fight rag n 
continued {rom page I r 

The debate over ahoruon ha 
only escalated since the J 970s, With 

JCtlVt~l!. on both ~Ides of the aisle 
becoming more radIcal and mili-
tJnt. 

"\Vhat the lantI-choice move-
ment] has done is attack the right to 
choo!>C hy putung resuictions and 
seelllg If those will hold up," 
Stephens ~'lId . "For example, If a 
woman IS marned, how much can 
the government require III terms of a 
disclosure between the husband and 
the ", fe' In the best of both worlds, 
you would want that to be a loving 
and mutual deciSion, but thats not 
always pan of the real world." 

A pomt of contention between 
abortion fights and anti-abortion 
rights activists is the subject of so-
ca lled partial-birth aboruons. 

"It's a misnomer," Stephens 
said. "We're using word that are 
expressly aSSOCiated with the hfe of 
the fetus. It's a hyperbolic way of 
uSlIlg these notions that play to 
what we have soclahzed women to 
believe that they have an obligation 
to society and to those cells that arc 
growmg Wlthlll you ." 

In fact, there IS no acrual med-
ical term called a parual -hirth abor-
tion, wluch IS why lel.'1slation refer-
flng to such a procedure has had 
trouble pa ing through congre . 
The Center for Disease Control 

and Prevention estimates onl}' one-
50th of I percent of all ab<lrtlons 
occur when a ferus IS developed 
enough to survive outside the 
uterus. The CD P al 0 estimates 
that 88 percent of all abortions take 
place withm the first trimeHer. 

H owever, for Operation Rescue 
West, one of the most prominent 
anti-abortion activist groups, the 
philosophy in ne abortion i~ one 
too many. 

"Lf Hell's gates were a storefront 
on Main Street, wouldn't you go and 
tell its cmtomer about Jesus 
Christ'" Operation Rescue Slates on 
its Web sire. "The baby-killing cen-
ter (abortion c1imc) LS a storefront on 
Main Sucet. All those who are 
entering the clinic have no hope. 
They have given up on all that is 
good and are about to murder their 
own child. The act they are about to 
perform b paramounr to swcide." 

While not all anti -aboruon pro-
ponents agree with Operation 
Rescue's evangelical tactic, they 
ee abortion as the talong of a life 

- something that I IInmoral and 
illegal.The Catholic Church con-
tends that "the inahenahle right to 
life of every innocent human mdi-
VIdual is a con!lurutive clemcnt of a 
CIVIl society and Its legislauon ." 

In California, the law treats a 
womcn' fight to have an abonlon

"Va ri ous ~tates have It1tcrprctcd

14 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Why persist in a 
necessary evil long 

after the necessiry ha 
ceased to exist? 

Why teach medical 
student to be 

merciless? 
Why discourage 

compassion? Why perpetuate a 
cycle of breeding-
caging-killing? 

Why extinguish 
empathy? 

Why kill dogs in first year 
pharmacology and physiology at 

UCSD School of Medicine? 
Lethal vivi ection of purpo e-bred dogs i not necessary to teach pharmacology or 
physiology These labs per ist despite the fact that 95% of US medical schools kill 

no animals, let alone dog , in pharmacology. And 82% kill no animals, let alone dogs, 
in physiology. They persist despite opposition from hundreds of San Diego physicians 
who signed a petition urging that they cease. They persist despite the fact that they 
are not necessary for research or surgery practice. They persist despite animal use 
guidelines urging replacement of lethal labs when alternatives are available. They 
persist because the UCSD Animal Subject Committee concludes that lethal dog 

vivisection labs involve "no animal welfare issues." Doctors against dog labs urge all 
MSIs who feel inclined towards compassion and mercy to opt out of these upcoming 
labs before the Feb. 1 Deadline. We also urge the UCSD Community to contact the 
Anjma1 Subjects Committee at iacuc@ucsd.edu and express opposition to continued 

dog labs . You can learn more about physician opposition to UCSD Dog Labs by 
visiting our website at www.doctorsagainstdoglabs.com.

their efforts were fina lly rewarded. 
Sophomore oU[side hitter Adam 
' loren picked up six of his 18 lOlls 
and junior opposite Jim Waller 
worked toward his match-high 
tota l of 30 when U SD closed i t 
out 30-27. 

",ame three remain ed close 
throughout, btll the ' Iriron hlock 
ca llle lip With two huge plays with 
UCS D holding on to a narrow 1. 1-
20 Icad latc in the game that 
oJleneu up a three-point advantage 
and gave thc Tfltons cnough to 
COIlIC out on LOp Hl-26. 

In thc fourth ga IllC , thc 
BUl"kc\,cs seellled to fold with the 
lIlollle'nlllln entirely in the Triton 
coLIn and UCSD rolled at .10-20. 

\ "hen thc UU\t hau se ttled, the 
Tntoll'i cOIllPi led an impre~~i\e SU t 
sheet with .1 .377 attacking pcrcent -
.lgC, 12 oS le.llll blocks Jlld 31 digs, 
bu t IlH)\t IInpre~\I\'e were the num-
bers for the ne\\ setter. Perrine 
lOuled (,) ,1"I't'o - two lIlore than 
the ' li'Hom had In their prevIOus 

two matches - whi le afso leading 
his tea m in digs with seven. 

"Eric's probably the most ath-
letic guy on our tcam. I I e just does 
an amazi ng job of getting to the 
ball," Waller sa id. " I Ie makes it 
easy for me. T here were so many 
til11es where I knew their block just 
had no chance." 

' loren, who posted a career-high 
in kill s, also applauded his new set-
ter for the personal and tcam suc-
cess, but also wondered whethcr 

OSU'~ overconfidence may have 
((lllle into play.

Tritons tough in the first game, a 
30-28 win for UCSD dcflated their 
sa ils. UCSD used the 18 lOlls for 
Waller and 17 by T.J. Young to take 
the next two games easily - 30-23 
and 30- 15 - for the sweep. 

Toren had nine digs whife fibero 
Chris Mortimer had eight. UCSD 
outblocked OSU 9.5 to 4.5 , led by 
Brian Foott, who had five block 
assists and asserted the Tritons' 
\Vest Coast dominance. 

Coach Larsen said he felt that his 
temn was at an advantage playing 
against the best teams in the counuy 
eJch wcek in the MPSF, and sug-

ge~ted that the Buckeyes' lack of 
Ijllaliry competition left them 
underprepared for the Tritons. 

"[The teams] are better Out

attempted to kick the ball betwcen 

FL-sized goalposts. 
"I think [the NFL ExpeTience]

Fans to 
blame for 
apathy at 

UCSD games 

o 
Owen Main 

I 'm calling vou out. Ycah, I'm talklng t~l 'rou, ,\I r. (or .\b.) "thcre\ nothing fun to do at 
CSD" freshman 'who SI[S :Jnd 

char, on .\.1..\1. to vour ultemate 
les~ then ~o fect awa}'. I'm talkll1g to 
all lhe studcnt herc who whine 
ahoul alhlcnc,. I ha\'e a mc;sage for 
you . It\ \,our own damn collectJ\'c 
faull. . 

Spin! :\Ight i on Jan. 24. (A 
night that, for one women \ and 
men' basketball game, thiS school 
prctends to be fired up before 
receding Into the six-college seclu-
sion and Isolation that is UC D.) 
The sad thing IS that most people 
who go to Spirit ight probably 
haven't e\'er been to a UCSD ba -
ketball game and probably won't 
e\'er go to one again. 

j one of what I'm about to say is 
exclusive to Spirit ight. In fact, it 
houldn't be. But here are a few 

things you can do to make Spirit 
Night more fun and po sibly make 
going to a game somethmg that will 
3t least eros YOUT mJJ1d befoTe you 
make the decision to stay in your 
dorm room and read your biology 
book on a Friday night. 

Do what you need to do to get 
fired up. Paint your face, throw a 
pre-game party, get some Thtmder-
Stick.!., whatever. Just comc to the 
game with some energy. 

Cheer the right way. We have a 
six-college system, and that's terrif-
IC If you're the UCSD administra-
tion. But using Spint Night as a 
competinon between colleges can 
get ridiculous. 

\Vhen colleges cheer for them-
,elve; and pay no attention to 
what's going on on the court, the 
gallic I; almost secondary to the 
competilion. You can't co",~nce me 
thai thats right on any level. Ilave 
pnde ll1 your college If you want to, 
but have pride in your university 
and the team on the COurt who rep-
resenn. that university first. 

For those leaders of pro-college 
chants - save them for halftime and 
maybc lImcouts. The rest of the 
lime (I.e. dUring the game), lets 
cheer for what', going on on the 
court. You're all great when it comes 
to gerung people to scream "TMC!" 
or "ERe l", but other chants or 
checr~ may be more effcclive. 

-nlere al~o I~n't enough heckling 
gOlllg on. Maybe we're all Just toO 
nice, but there have got to be a few 
,ohd hecklers at thi, ;chool who 
can ;u behll1d the visltor~' bench or 
on the ~Idelme~ and get m some-

Tritons win back-to-back over OSU 
Men' voll yball takes both matches against No. 13 Buckeyes 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

l'he fOllrth ;et of hands wa~ the 
clurm for thc Tritons :1, scnior 
Enc Perrine's IIlsernon 111[0 the 
scttcr p<lsition ga\'c the team a new 
sp.lrk and lifted the UC D llIen'~ 
volleyball team to consecutive vic-
tones over Ohio State Univer ItY. 

UC D uffercd irs econd con-
secutive loss to open the cason on 
Jan. 15 when It travcled to Thc 
Pyramid to open ItS Moulltain 
Pacific SpOrtS Fcderation schedule 
agalllst the 4gers of Long Beach 
State University. The 4gers cored 
the fir't rivc points of the 1II.ltch, 
and from ulere thlllgs f.liled to 
improve for the Tritons. Tye 
Thoreson, Joe Gnffin and Nate 
Jones com hilled for 30 a~sisr; on 
the night, while splitting time at 
the etter position, bur the UCSD 
offense never got on track. Lapses 
al.,o allowed long 4ger rum, which 
broke games wide open and sent 
the Tritons reelll1g 3-0 (30-19, 30-
26, 30-22). 

After opening the season 111 
unimpressive form, UC D head 
coach Ron Larsen looked for a 
solution to his team's frustrating 

start by moving the most stable 
piece of his puzzle. 

Perrine started his career :It 
U SD as a setter, but during his 
sophomore year he moved to mid-
dle blocker '- where at 6 feet, 3 
inches, he is cOIISJ(lered small -
and finished in the top 10 in the 
nation in blocks. To start this cam-
paign, Perrine lined up at outside 
hitter and led his team in kills and 

dig~ through the fir;t two match-
e . \-"'hen Lar~en uggested that 
he pend omc rime in practice 
working on his setting, Perrine 
reulrned to his original position 
and found a new way to shine. 

The 13th-ranked OhiO State 
Buckeyes' \~sit to RL\lA Arena 
for a arurday- unda), double-
header gave the Tntons a chance 
ro get off to a good start with their 
new iineup. Ilowever, the first 
game of the match 011 Jan. 18 
appeared to be more of the same 
when UCSD stayed closc to 
OSU, bur the Buckeyes pulled 
away late for a 30-26 victory. 

The Tritons appeared to grow 
more confident as the match pro-
gressed, and in the second game,

Women's basketball 
earns split over weekend 
Run falls short against Coyotes, 
but UCSD recovers next night 

By OWEN MAIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Things are getting bener for 
the UCSD women's basketball 
tcam. A split of last weekend's 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association games gave the 
Tritons wins in three of their last 
four games and brought thcir 
record to 3-5 in ule CCAA con-
ference and 3-10 overall after an 
0-9 start to the season. 

On Jan. 17, the Tritons looked 
for their third straight ~Ctory 
when they played host to CSU 

an Bernardino at RIMAC arena, 

but a slow start put them behind 
early, and despite a late charge, 
the TritOns fell to the Coyotes 58-
50. 

uWe played very sluggish in 
the first half," said UCSD co-cap-
tain icholle Bromley, who 
had 10 points and five rebounds in 
the loss. ult looked like we were 
moving in siow-Illotion out 
there."
