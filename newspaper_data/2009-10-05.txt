Campus burglaries and auto 
thefts each decreased by roughly 
50 percent  last year, according 

to the 2009 Clery 
Report — released 
by the UCSD Police 
Department on Oct. 
1. The report pro-
vides statistics on 
reported campus 
crimes and arrests, 

along with disciplinary referrals, 
made in 2008.

Reported burglaries went down 
from 91 in 2006 to 53 in 2008, while

Now that Muir College’s two primary 
cafeterias, El Mercado and Sierra Summit, 
are out of commission — the former per-
manently and the latter temporarily, for 
renovations — one would imagine that an 
avalanche of growling stomachs would be 
bursting through the doors of at nearby 
dining halls Plaza Cafe and Oceanview 
Terrace.

However, according to Associate 
Director of Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality Steven Casad, students from 
Muir’s formerly crowded cafeterias are 
actually disseminating cleanly into the 
other dining halls.

Oceanview Terrace is accomodating 
the largest portion of Muir dwellers, at 
22 percent. 

Taking a close second is the brand-
new Goody’s Place and Market, which 
has absorbed roughly 18 percent of Muir’s 

residents — followed by Plaza with 10 
percent and Cafe Ventanas with 6 per-
cent. 

Associate Director of Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Steven Casad said that 

there is always a period of heavier traffic 
in the dining halls during Fall Quarter, 
which he attributes to administrators 

Closure of Sierra Summit, 
Mercado means heavier 
Fall Quarter traffic
at other campus eateries.

U C President Mark G. Yudof met with student newspa-per staff and A.S. representatives this weekend at the UC Irvine Student Center. According to UC spokes-
man Lynn Tierney — who played hostess at the meeting — it 
was the first president-student meeting in about 40 years.

The rendezvous took place around a small 
conference table bordered by spongy bagels, 
assorted jams, individually-packaged teabags 
and exotically-labeled coffee. After entering 
the room and introducing himself to staff 
members from the Southern California UC 
newspapers, Yudof seated himself at the head 

of the table behind a Coca-Cola Zero and an empty glass. 
“Thanks for coming on a Saturday,” he said. “I know you 

have better things to do.”
UC Irvine Chancellor Michael Drake entered behind Yudof, 

introducing himself and taking a seat on the president’s right.
“I need a copy of the blue folder,” Yudof said, pouring himself 

the Coke. “You all know Chancellor Drake? Any problems here, 
at Irvine, I just want you to know it’s all his fault. For the record.”

Drake laughed.

Last Saturday, he met with student press for

A former campus parking-

enforcement officer is claiming that 
UCSD Parking and Transportation 
operates on an illegal ticket-quota 
system — allegedly forcing staff to 
hand out a minimum number of 
tickets every day. 

“They don’t say you have to give 
out so many tickets, but if you don’t 
meet whatever number, they chastise 
you and tell you to get your numbers 
up,” former officer Kenneth Brennan 
said. “They start harassing people, 

and they start giving out tickets that 
they wouldn’t normally give out … 
That’s not right.” 

Brennan, who was employed by 
UCSD for over 20 years, said an 
unofficial quota system forces park-
ing officers to give out tickets for

minor infractions that would nor-
mally only merit warnings. 

“If someone’s over the line a lit-
tle bit, normally the department 
wouldn’t give a ticket out,” Brennan 
said. “If someone pays $7 for an all 
day pass and accidentally parks in 
an ‘A’ spot, that shouldn’t be a cita-
tion, it should be a warning.” 

Brennan said he suspected his 
supervisor encouraged him to hand 
out parking citations rather than 
focus on his own job specialty — to 
investigate disabled-placard abuse 
and fraud — because fines collected 
for parking tickets go to the univer-
sity, whereas fines from disabled-
placard abuse are paid into a San 
Diego County fund. 

Brennan claimed he was fired 
because he wasn’t issuing a five-a-

day minimum of parking citaitons.
“My supervisor, Marty 

[Greenawalt], told me I wasn’t 
bringing any money in,” 
he said. “They don’t even 
care about the handicap 
violations.” 

Quota ticketing sys-
tems are prohibited under 
the California Vehicle 
Code, which states that 
no agencies “may estab-
lish any policy requiring 
(a) quota (for) arrests 
(or) citations.” 

Brennan further 
alleged that his supervi-
sors sent out monthly 
e-mails listing how many 
tickets each officer had 
issued — another practice that is 
prohibited under California state 

law. 
Brennan said that in the past, the 

department would offer prizes — 
such as iPods or cameras 
— to the officers who 
issued the most parking 
tickets during a particu-
lar time period. 

“They print a sheet 
and e-mail it to each per-
son and compare each 
person,” he said. “And 
that’s wrong. I know two 
officers that were threat-
ened [with losing their 
jobs] already. These peo-
ple are afraid to admit 
things.” 

Two UCSD parking-
enforcement officers 

contacted for this story refused to 
comment. 

Director of Parking  and 
Transportation Brian D’Autremont 
also denied comment, but provided 
the following statement: 

“There is no quota system at 
UC San Diego regarding any type 
of parking or transportation cita-
tion. Several departments, includ-
ing the Transportation Services 
Department, participated in a cam-
pus incentive award program in 
2005 through 2007 in which the 
names of exemplary employees who 
were nominated by their supervi-
sors were entered into a monthly 
drawing to win either a camera or 
an iPod. The program was discon-
tinued in 2007 because of budgetary 
constraints.”

crimes decreased from 75 in 2006 to 
30 in 2008.

In contrast, arrests involving 
narcotics went up from 36 in 2006 
to 60 in 2008. Similarly, the alcohol-
related offenses have made a steady 
increase: 34 arrests in 2006, 100 in 
2007 and 131 in 2008. 

UCSD Police Chief Orville King 
said the decrease in burglary and 
vehicle theft is not only a trend on 
the UCSD campus and surrounding 
communities, but within the region 
of San Diego County as a whole.

King does not attribute the 
decline in theft to any particular 
program implemented by the UCSD 
or San Diego Police Department, 
but to increased public awareness of 

neighborhood crime.
He said the community is more 

informed than before on how to 
avoid being victimized by burglary 
and theft, and individuals are more 
likely to report these instances when 
they do occur. 

King attributes the surge in 
drug- and alcohol-related offenses 
since 2006 to increased security at 
UCSD’s Sun God Festival. He says 
that the majority of such arrests on 
campus occur at large, campuswide 
events like Sun God.

King expects the security tactics 
employed by the UCPD at this year’s 
festival to be similar to those used 
last year.

The Clery Report contains 
information pertaining not only to 

crimes occuring on the UCSD cam-
pus, but also to those in surround-
ing areas. 

However, the report is compiled 
primarily for UCSD students, fac-
ulty and staff.

The Clery Report is federally 
mandated by the Jeanne Clery 
Disclosure of Campus Crime 

Statistics Act, which requires insti-
tutions of higher learning to publish 
an annual report containing crime 
statistics. It was previously known as 
the Federal Student Right-to-Know 
and Campus Security Act.

PARKING OFFICER



NEWS� MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

feverishly hiring student staffers dur-
ing Week One and training them 
Week Two — right when the demand 
for food hits its peak.  

As for Muir-related traffic, Casad 
said Goody’s has helped ease the 
added pressure.

“We knew that the business 
we had [in Muir] was going to go 
somewhere else,” Casad said. “That’s 
why we built Goody’s. It’s the clos-
est building we had that we could 
take over, and we could spend some 
money that wasn’t going to be just 
thrown away.”

So far, the new market — mod-
eled after El Mercado and located in 
Thurgood Marshall College — has 
been a popular destination for stu-
dents. It offers Chipotle-style bur-
ritos and a full salad bar, as well as 
sandwiches and desserts. 

“The kids love it,” Casad said.  
“[There is] speedy service — by the 
time you stand at the first person 
saying ‘What do you want? You want 
a burrito, a bowl or a salad?’ From 
there it’s a minute, a minute and a 
half to get through.  So the long line 
is a long line, but it’s really fast.”

Revelle College freshman Steve 
Lopez is a fan.  

“I’ve had it, like, five times 
already,” Lopez said.  “[I like] the 
burritos — that’s what everybody gets 
when they go there.  It actually does 
get pretty trafficky … [but] I would 
still recommend it, ’cause it’s, like, six 
bucks, and it tastes really good.”

The market is one of the few 
late-night options available on cam-
pus, remaining open until 1 a.m. 
Oceanview Terrace, — previously the 
go-to for late-night Mexican grub 
on campus — now closes at 9 p.m. 
nightly.  

“I [do] like the burritos [at 
Goody’s],” Muir sophomore Jessica 
Yaros said.  “But I guess [Housing 
and Dining] thought that since they 

opened that, they would shut down 
the Mexican food area in OVT, so 
there’s really nowhere to get good 
quesadillas anymore.”

Marshall resident Conely Cha 
said she has noticed a slight swell in 
OVT’s population.

“OVT is crowded, especially dur-
ing lunchtime,” Chan said.  “Usually 
the lines are very long, and even then, 
though there are four cashiers, there’s 
only usually one or two that are open 
…[but] it’s not that big of a deal.”

Nevertheless, Casad assured that 
the new Muir dining halls —expected 
to commence construction in January 
2010 and re-open Fall Quarter 2010 
— will be well worth the wait.

“It’s going to be twice as big as 
it was before,” Casad said. “I really 
want to make it a vegetarian/vegan 
location. Our population of vegans/
vegetarians is very vocal, so I want 
to give them a place to say, ‘This is 
your place.’ There’s no meat. It’s all 

green, it’s all fresh — it’s all vegan/
vegetarian.”

Casad said that Housing and 
Dining also has a new market in the 
works, which will be located across 
from the Village at North Torrey Pines 
— UCSD’s new transfer-housing com-
plex — and is slated to open in 2012. 

Adjacent to the proposed market 
will be a sit-down restaurant where 
students can order high-quality 
meals — possibly accompanied by a 
beer and wine menu for cusltomers 
of age — with their meal cards.

“I want to go one more level that 
allows you, on campus, to have a nice 
experience — to have a date,” Casad 
said. “So you don’t have a car, you 
don’t have to take the bus, you don’t 
have to go off-campus … We want to 
give you an opportunity to sit down 
and have a nice meal.”

Lots of people have the idea that evangelical Christians 
think sex is inherently dirty, sinful, perhaps a necessary 

evil, but certainly not to be appreciated and enjoyed.  
But just the opposite is true.  Secular research has shown 
that couples who enjoy their sexual relationship the most 

are married evangelical Christians.  Surprised?  You shouldn’t be, and 
here’s why.

Sex was God’s idea in the first place.  He created us male and female 
for a reason!  He made sex to be pleasurable as well as powerful.  Sex 
is powerful, both in its ability to profoundly unite two people and also 
in its creative potential in bringing new life into the world.  When a 
couple commits in love “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for 
better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, till 
death do us part,” they are declaring to one another, before God and 
their family and friends, that they are taking responsibility for one 
another in love, no matter what the future brings.  That is exactly the 
context of committed love that God intends for the fulfillment of our 
sexual nature.  And that’s why, when we are rightly related to God and 
totally committed to our spouse, sex can be wonderfully satisfying.

Looking at the university campus scene, obviously there’s a lot of sex 
happening.  But is it really satisfying?  Ninety-one percent of college 
women nationwide say that “a hook-up culture” defines their 
campuses.  A report entitled “Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping 
for Mr. Right:  College Women on Mating and Dating Today” indicates 
that casual sexual encounters are a large part of college life.  A 
“hook-up” is defined as when a girl and a guy get together for a 
physical encounter but don’t necessarily expect anything further.  
Hook-ups almost always happen when both have been drinking or are 
drunk.  According to the Independent Women’s Forum, 40% of the 
women surveyed had experienced a hook-up, and one in ten reported 
having done so “more than six times.”  But 63% of the women want to 
meet a future husband at college and 83% say that marriage is a major 
life goal.

Radio and television commentator Dr. Drew Pinsky has pointed out 
that the desire women have for commitment in the face of so many 
sexual encounters suggests that college women are afraid to assert 
their true wishes.  Dr. Drew once said on ABC News’ Good Morning 
America that the college campus is a young man’s perfect world.  “For 
the men,” he said, “this is a very comfortable situation.  I tour the 
country and speak to colleges all across the land, and I’ll tell you that 
women are at best ambivalent about that and very commonly 
disillusioned.”  Doesn’t sound very fulfilling to me.  You and I weren’t 
created to mate like dogs, in meaningless serial relationships.  We are 
made in the image of God, and He has higher, more exalted purposes 
for us.

Perhaps the college sex scene is like the Emperor’s New Clothes.  Con 
artists had convinced the Emperor and his court that the clothes they 
were spinning for the Emperor were of purest gold, but they could only 
be seen by those who were wise.  Of course, the Emperor wanted to 
be wise, so when they fit on him the non-existent clothes, he 
pretended to see them and admire them.  His court, also not wanting 
to be thought fools, pretended to see them as well.  Finally, in the 
majestic parade through town, as the Emperor walked in his 
underwear, all the citizens pretended to see the clothes, too.  All, that 
is, except one, who said, “Hey!  The Emperor doesn’t have any clothes 
on!”  Maybe it’s time for some courageous UCSD women and men to 
wake up and be honest: “Hey!  Something’s wrong with the way we’re 
doing sex!”  Got the guts?

“You should write that; I want to see your 
pens going. It’s all my fault. Write that.”

Then the room sobered up, and Yudof 
launched into a 20-minute presentation about 
the university’s current financial crisis, complete 
with blue and gold folders filled with colorful 
charts and graphs. 

After he finished, he invited questions from 
the students journalists present.

UC Irvine New University: You talked a lot 
about the new financial-aid program and how it’s 
going to help students out. But for families above 
$180,000 who have more than, you know, one 
child — maybe like, two or three kids that they’re 
trying to send through the UC — that’s still going 
to be an extreme financial hardship for them.

Yudof: It could be ... There’s some scholar-
ship money. There’s scholarship programs that 
we don’t really control — that’s Cal grants, pri-
marily. But you’re right, that’s true. But my way 
of thinking is: We only have so much money. We 
have to take care of the poorest 
kids first. There’s some money 
that comes from — well, not so 
much the Pell, but probably the 
Cal Grants and maybe some 
freestanding scholarships — but, 
that’s right. It will be tough for 
those who have five children and 
are making $180,000 a year. It 
will be tougher. Because really 
the federal and state financial-aid 
programs, by and large, don’t kick 
in. You know, we only have so 
much money. And it’s very hard 
for me to justify putting much 
money to those above $180,000 
when I can’t cover all the people 
under $100,000. That’s the reality.

You know, we’re not anywhere 
near the highest rates in the 
country. If you look at Penn State, 
Illinois, and other — I think we’re 
a better institution, but we’re not 
at the highest rate by any stretch. 
Our problem is that the cost of 
living is higher in California. 
Many of our campuses — you 
know, Westwood and so forth 
— are fairly pricey places to be, 
when you actually look at the fee structure. The 
other thing some universities do, just to lay out 
some alternatives: In Michigan and Virginia they 
take huge numbers of nonresidents and they 
charge them full rate at $30,000 a year. And we 
have not done that, because we feel that we’re 
quintessentially a California institution, so we’re 
like 94 or 95 percent resident students, and I’m 
not willing to really bump up the nonresidents 
because I think our first duty is to Californians, 
because that’s who’s paying the taxes. Now, I 
wish they’d pay a little bit more in taxes, to sup-
port us, but they’re not willing to do that. So 
other universities are more expensive or have 
enrolled huge numbers of nonresidents and just 
charged them a ton of money, and we haven’t 
really done that.

The UCSD Guardian: You’ve defended high 
executive salaries by arguing we must offer com-
petitive pay to retain talented executives. What 
exactly would happen if you settled for less 
‘competitive’ candidates, and is retaining more 
‘competitive’ executives worth pushing students 
out of the university?

Yudof: Well, there’s an unloaded question. 
The first big lie is that the executives have been 
getting raises during this — it’s just not true. 
Everyone at the Office of the President, includ-
ing me, is paid 10 percent less. Second: If you 
didn’t have me, and I just went off and practiced 
law in Philadelphia or did something like that, 
you don’t save enough money to balance this 
budget. It’s very little money compared to the 
total number. Third: Most of the people paid 
over $200,000 are physicians. They’re not even 
paid out of state dollars. They treat patients at 
clinics. They staff our hospitals. That’s probably 
two-thirds, 70 percent, of all people paid over 
$200,000. You know, you’re a surgeon, and you 
treat a patient, and the insurance company pays, 
and they pay a portion of your salary — that’s 
most of the executive salaries. Fourth: we’re not 
competitive. Our chancellors’ latest pay cut is 
40 percent below market. It’s already 40 percent 
below market. There. Someone needs to run 
these operations. I’m sorry, but hospitals need 
medical directors. Campuses need chancellors. 
And it makes a difference — and we’re already 
paying 30 or 40 percent below market — you 
want to pick the best people you can. I picked 
a woman, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, to be 
head of UCSF — first woman to be head of that 
campus. I paid her about 25 percent of her prior 
salary. She has on her plate — she has to raise 
money for a $1.8 billion hospital. Why should I 
pick someone that I’ll pay $50,000 less, who may 

be unsuccessful raising the funds for that hos-
pital. And that’s the problem. If California were 
out of control, if the UC were out of control — if 
we had extravagant executive salaries — we 
don’t. The Office of the President has actually 
cut $60,000 out recently. I mean, I just think this 
is fantasyland. The fantasy is you have overpaid 
executives and if you stopped it, you wouldn’t 
have to raise fees or have furloughs. The fantasy 
is we have reserves, which we don’t have. And 
you don’t have to do these things because you 
can just dig into this pot of gold. These are just 
make-believe. The reality is: We’re paid below 
market salaries. We probably should have higher 
salaries, but we don’t, and we make do.

Drake: I just want to make a commentary, 
to make sure that we’re clear. When I mentioned 
that we’re the best public research university 
system in the world, that’s because it’s true. And 
the difference between ‘A’ and ‘A+’ is really huge. 
And I’ll say that for the people who we have here 
on campus — the quality of our professors and 

the people that help lead the cam-
pus — when we get the best people, 
they make grand decisions and 
they make us the best in the world. 
When we deviate from that, we 
then sink down from where we are. 
We got to be who we are by hav-
ing the best people and supporting 
them in doing their best work, and 
that’s the difference between ‘A’ and 
‘A+’.

The UCLA Daily Bruin: I 
understand what you’ve been saying 
about executive pay, just to go back 
to that subject, but regarding the 
recent New York Times interview 
you had, where your salary was 
compared to that of the President 
of the United States, who makes 
$400,000 a year — I understand 
that your comments were facetious, 
but I was just wondering if you had 
any additional comments.  

Yudof: I don’t have any addi-
tional comments. You know I had 
a zany interviewer, and I gave her 
zany answers. And the truth is, if 
you threw in the White House, 
a 747 and a lifetime pension of 

$400,000, I’d certainly take the job — although 
in my opinion, it’s not a job I’d want to hold. It’s 
a pretty tough job that President Obama has. 
But I don’t know what to say. Do you know 
how much your dermatologist is paid, or how 
much your surgeon is paid, or how much your 
internist is paid? They’re all paid more than the 
president of the United States. It’s a very different 
sort of job, apparently. There are markets. And 
the way to recruit a Nobel Laureate person, you 
know — we have to pay the market. There aren’t 
markets for presidents. I’m less well off than I 
was at the University of Texas. It doesn’t matter; 
I don’t feel underpaid or anything. But the point 
of the matter is, the president of the local bank 
is probably paid more than the President of the 
United States, and so on. The president’s job is to 
be generous — it’s unique. But there are markets 
at all sorts of levels, and we’re below market. Our 
top-paid chancellor, among the research uni-
versities, is something like 50th out of 62 — our 
top-paid chancellor. If you want to get serious, 
take a look at the president’s salary at Michigan. 
Take a look at the University of Texas. There’s a 
market. And then you compare it, and then you 
can decide whether we’re overpaid. And then 
write to the Board of Regents, because they set 
my salary. They won’t let me set my own; I’d pre-
fer to set my own, but they won’t let me.

The UCSD Guardian: So would you be will-
ing to accept a lower salary, maybe as a gesture?

Yudof: I did. I cut my salary 10 percent.
The UCSD Guardian: I mean, like, lower 

than it is now.
Yudof: You know, I’d consider anything, but 

markets are markets, and at some point you will 
cut out the good people. And you’re not going to 
cut your way into resolving this budget. I mean, 
I’ll consider anything at the appropriate time. 
But, um, I think this idea — why would you 
want to do that?

The UCSD Guardian: As a gesture.
Yudof: I already did my gesture. Did you do 

yours?
The UCSD Guardian: We pay higher stu-

dent fees.
Yudof: What sort of gesture do you want? 

I’ve done two gestures. We actually took a pay 
cut before everybody else in June, and another 
pay cut in September. These are gestures. It’s 
below market. The chancellors had to do the 
same thing — it was a gesture. How many ges-
tures do you want?

SALARIES TO OFFSET  
THE DEFICIT? VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes
√  No
√  I don’t know

There comes a defining instant in every student’s life at which he can no longer stomach that 
1,000th Subway foot-long. After only 
a week back at school, my moment 
of taste bud evolution has already 
arrived. Having passed my threshold 
for premade provisions, only one 
solution remained: attempt to cook.

My past culinary efforts have been 
no more courageous than tossing a 
premade Trader Joe’s burrito in the 
microwave or mixing marinara with 
pasta. Over the years I’ve been so con-
ditioned to seek instant gratification 
from fast, over-the-counter eats that 
I couldn’t imagine myself sauteing 
or mincing — or any of those other 
things cooks do in kitchens. 

I do, however, come from a family 
of hardcore foodies. My grandmother 
is the queen. In her house, food is a 
cure-all. Tough day at work? Lentil 
soup. Twisted your ankle? Beef kabob 
and herb rice with a glass of red wine. 
If there aren’t plumes of steam and 
exotic aromas wafting through the 
house, it’s either because her soap 
operas are on, or it’s 3 a.m.

No cooking endeavor could be 
properly executed without my grand-
ma’s wisdom. So I made the call and 
asked her for recipes that fit the fol-
lowing guidelines: healthy, simple to 
make (under 15 minutes of prepara-
tion), composed of affordable ingredi-
ents and possessing some internation-
al flair. A little over a minute of deep 
consideration and she asked: “How 
about some grilled-chicken couscous 
salad and cream-of-broccoli soup?” 

Next thing I knew, I was standing 
in the fresh produce section of Trader 
Joe’s, far from the comfort of the 
frozen-foods aisle. I couldn’t help but 
doubt my commitment to cooking as 
I picked out what I thought were ripe 
Roma tomatoes. Was I really about 
to waste all this time and effort when 
I could just as easily swipe my debit 
card at Croutons and call it a day? 

On the ride home from TJ’s, I 
tried to reason my decision to cook. 
Forget the obvious economic benefits 
of making one $30 grocery trip for 
healthy, fresh food rather than what 
might amount to three separate $10 
burrito runs on a daily basis — I 
was equally excited by the fact that 
my soon-to-be cooking skills would 
instantly make me more attractive. 

After all, what’s sexier 
than a home-cooked 
meal? 

With newfound 
motivation, I began 
dicing the tomatoes, 
onions and bell pep-
pers with a sense 

of purpose I had previously only 
exhibited while playing sports or 
debating politics. After glancing at 
my haphazard collection of vegetable 
bits, I learned my first cooking les-
son: Wielding a knife like Grandma 
requires a sense of confidence, tech-
nique and dexterity that can only be 
acquired after years of practice.

Thankfully, the rest was so easy 
that tomato dicing was half the battle. 
All I had to do was pour a packet of 
couscous into the saucepan (note: 
opening packets is easy) and add two

A Longer Pipe Won’t Fix the System

NATIONAL NEWS — President 
Obama announced last Monday that 
schools should have longer days and 
shorter summer vacations, to increase 
our global competitiveness. And 
while the majority of American media 
networks stand in agreement — Fox 
News included — the U.S. should be 
cautious not to crash and burn in an 
overreaching attempt to catch up with 
international education standards.

While no bills have yet been draft-
ed, Obama has proposed that schools 
stay open later, and over the weekend, 
to raise the national standard for 
American children.

But there’s no telling whether a 
longer school day would accomplish 
that lofty goal. A 2007 study from 
the National Center for Education 
Statistics, published through the U.S. 
Department of Education, shows that 
12th graders in other countries who 
spend less time in school are — on 
national average — still outscoring 
American children in math and sci-
ence.

European countries average 
one hour of schooling less than the 
U.S. each day. Still, 14 out of the 20 
countries sampled in the study (rang-
ing from Australia to Switzerland 
to France) outperformed American 
students.

Major studies from private groups 
such as the Knowledge is Power 
Program — a network of college-
preparatory schools that aim to help 
low-income students achieve col-
lege admission — are inconclusive 
in showing whether longer school 
hours would increase test scores (not 
to mention collective national intel-
ligence) on the grander scale.

Using math scores from other 
countries, the Brookings Institution 
has the most convincing argument for 
extending the school day’s length: Its 
study suggests that an extra 10 min-
utes for students to ask questions is all 
it takes to eliminate the gap in math 
proficiency. Yet the same study shows 
that when 13 countries decreased 
their instruction time, the U.S. was 

one of only three countries in which 
test scores did not go down. 

It’s clear: Time limitations aren’t 
the sole influence on our academic 
performance.

Plus, it would be unhealthy to 
work our kindergarteners to the bone. 
A study for the Journal of Pediatrics 
led by Dr. Romina M. Barros, pedia-
trician and assistant clinical profes-
sor at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine, explains that a child’s brain 
often needs a break, and that down-
time is just as important as studying. 

Even if test scores did rise in 
accordance with the longer school 
day, sacrificing hours of socializing in 
exchange for lecturing, reading and 
memorizing would be a step in the 
wrong direction. The United States 
is unique in its cultural output and 
inventiveness — grilling students on 
long division for an extra hour each 
week won’t breed the next Steven King 
or Bob Dylan. 

Class time may also cut into the 
hours that kids spend bonding with 
their families and friends. According 
to the Child Development Institute, 
building social skills is essential to 
developing a conscience, learning the 
importance of communication and 
culture and being valued in a group. 

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne 
Duncan, who supports Obama’s push 
for an extended school day, said that 
the current school calendar is out-
dated and based on the old agrarian 
lifestyle that required kids to be out 
of school so they could  lend a hand 
on the farm. But the Afterschool 
Alliance, a nonprofit working to 
ensure the quality of after-school pro-
grams, claims that after-school activi-
ties are beneficial to learning because 
they create social connections. Even if 
our school schedule is based on an old 
way of life, the chess clubs and track 
teams of today have replaced the rak-
ing and hoing of the good old days. 

A longer school day would neces-
sitate higher teacher salaries and 
a larger workforce to keep schools 
open for more hours. Programs in 

Massachusetts under the expanded 
class time initiative showed that it 
costs an additional 12 percent to 15 
percent per student to add an extra 
class. Most school districts are gasping 
for breath under the current budget 
crisis; increasing the current workload 
would cause further economic strain. 
Not worth it — especially when stud-
ies show it probably wouldn’t even 
raise test scores.

Summer school is no longer just 
a form of remediation for slower kids 
on the playground. Parents send their 
kids to summer school to prevent 
them from forgetting what they’ve 
already learned, to catch up where 
they’re struggling and to get ahead for 
the upcoming year. 

In fact, according to a study by 
the Northwest Regional Education 
Laboratory, summer school offers a 
great chance for both gifted students 
and those who have fallen behind 
to explore subjects in greater depth. 
Rather than increasing mandatory 
school hours for all, we first should 
expand tutoring and extra-learning 
options for those students who 
need and want it most during 
summer hours.

After all, there’s no point in 
forcing kids to stare at a board 
for a couple more hours while 
they text their friends below 
desktops.

Granted, the govern-
ment already has money set 
aside for tutoring low-income 
students. The No Child Left 
Behind Act, in place since 
2002, requires schools to 
spend 20 percent of their 
Title-I federal-grant money on 
tutoring services at high-poverty 
schools. Schools in Washington 
D.C., for instance, have been 
able to spend $1,700 on each low-
income student in need of tutoring. 
Expanding that funding for tutoring 
to cover higher-income schools as 
well would increase the incentive 
to  help to close the interna-
tional achievement gap, and 

provide more focused attention on 
students who need it most. 

Although no estimates have 
been released as to the cost of the 
president’s plan, a more tutoring-
intensive approach would likely prove 
less expensive than a general time 
increase. Schools would be expanding 
programs already set in place under 
NCLB, and would only target those 
with a demonstrated need or desire 
for more classroom attention. 

While sweeping classroom change 
is certainly not out of the question, 
following through with Obama’s pro-
posal too hastily would be unwise, 
given that longer school hours haven’t 
yet proven themselves to be the 
answer. We must first emphasize stu-
dents’ varying individual needs before 
applying a one-size-fits-all band-aid 
to public education. Quantity doesn’t 
always mean quality.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
Spanish is the only other world 

language besides English. Escuela 
Superior de Administracion y 
Direccion de Empresas (Spain), 
El Instituto Panamericano de Alta 
Direccion de Empresa (Mexico), 
Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) 
and INCAE (Costa Rica) are ranked 
first, third, seventh and 10th, 
respectively, in the The Wall Street 
Journal’s list of top international 
business schools. The Ross School of 
Business (University of Michigan), 
the Tuck School of Business 
(Dartmouth College), the Tepper 
School of Business (Carnegie Mellon 
University), the Columbia School of 
Business (Columbia University)  and 
the Haas School of Business (UC 
Berkeley) are the top-five business 
schools in the United States. 

A total of 4,125 corporate recruit-
ers from Europe, Central and North 
America rank the schools for The 
Wall Street Journal’s list. What makes 
the journal article accurate is that 
those same recruiters will be hiring 
the next batch of MBAs in Europe, 
Central America and North America. 

China’s history with the MBA 
dates back to 1994 when the China 
Europe International Business School 
opened. The job market for graduates 
in China isn’t very good, so they must 
start thinking of where to get jobs 
and who in the world will hire them.

The MBA is now considered a 
standard for international manage-
ment, but the Chinese have a ways to 
go. Their view of the education pro-
cess and the MBA in particular differs 
greatly from that of Western culture. 
Usually, we see that when the econ-
omy is doing well in the West, there 
are fewer private enrollments in MBA 

courses, but when the economy is 
booming, more companies can afford 
to send their executives to study. But 
in China, there is not that concern 
(it is not a boom or bust economy), 
and businesses will not cut down on 
funding executives from attending the 
ever popular Executive MBA (which 
is slightly misleading since it is little 
more than a holiday for the execu-
tives of Chinese companies). 

Language is also very much a 
problem for the Chinese applicant to 
the west, and lack of work experience 
(which is a requirement for some 
B-schools) is actually a hindrance. 
Countries like the U.S., Britain and 
Canada scrutinize visa applicants 
closely, and there is a high degree of 
failure since the visa-granting officials 
determine whether applicants are not 
intending to return to China (and 
statistics support this belief).

My feeling is that China will 
import standards and apply situ-
ational courses for disciplines like 
human resources, rather than build 
its own model, since re-engineering is 
already such a highly developed busi-
ness in China. 

 The Chinese language, of course, 
has far more speakers than any other. 
Although these speakers are not as 
widely distributed worldwide as are 
speakers of English or Spanish.

Business Education Pivotal

cups chicken broth, one tablespoon 
olive oil, one-half teaspoon salt, and 
one-quarter teaspoon black pepper. 
Then I stirred the mix for about five 
minutes — fitting well within the con-
fines of my culinary capacity.

After letting the hot couscous fluff 
in the broth, I added some pre-grilled 
chicken strips, two sloppily diced 
Romas and two tablespoons of Italian 
flat-leaf parsley, then garnished with 
some lemon juice and green onions. 
To my astonished delight, I had pro-
duced a colorful salad that appeared 
to be a healthy and balanced entree 
— and it tasted at least as good as a $7 
salad from the Sunshine Store.

The soup proved just as simple. 
Melting the butter and sauteing 
the onions produced a confidence-
inspiring aroma of onion-y goodness. 
Once the onions were transparent, I 
added one cup of water, the chopped 
bell pepper, the packet of broccoli and 
a teaspoon of salt. Then I covered the 
saucepan and let the concoction sit 
until the veggies had tenderized. Next, 
I liquefied the contents of the sauce-
pan in the blender, adding milk inter-
mittently until it looked like my sauce 
was smooth. From there, I emptied 
the blender back into the pan, added 
the remainder of the milk and topped 
it off with a few drops of soy sauce for 
added flavor. A garnishing of black 

pepper and a bay leaf for presentation, 
and voila! In less than half an hour — 
the same time it would’ve taken to buy 
and unfreeze the burrito for which I’d 
always settled — I had a sumptuous-
looking salad and steaming soup, with 
four days’ worth of leftovers to spare. 

Perhaps the best part of the whole 
experience was transferring the salad 
and soup into their respective bowls. I 
felt accomplished — almost euphoric. 
Maybe that’s why the food tasted 
so good. Of course, I’m nowhere 
remotely close to cooking (nor wield-
ing a knife) like Grandma, and I’d 
be lying if I called myself a cook, but 
the reward for simply trying was well 
worth my minimal effort.

The number of people who attended the first
Comic-Con in 1970, according to the San Diego Union 
Tribune. Last year, an estimated 140,000 people 
attended the four-day event.

E arly next Sunday morning — if you’re still awake after a night of debauchery — peer into the dawning atmo-sphere at 6:10 a.m. Against the fixed backdrop of dim blinking stars, look for a bright dot moving purpose-
fully across the sky. What appears to be a mere speck to the 
naked eye is really the size of a football field, spinning 200 miles 
above our heads at over 17,000 miles per hour. You’ve landed on 
the International Space Station. 

Later this month, from Oct. 20 to Oct. 23, a Nikon 
Electronic Still Camera aboard the ISS will snap photographs 
of the Earth based on requests from middle-school students 
throughout the world. And facilitating the entire process — 
from school outreach to telling NASA when and where to take 
the pictures — is a group of 10 to 15 UCSD undergrads, serv-
ing on the team as interns.

The images are taken as part of ISS EarthKAM, a NASA-
sponsored program that aims to educate young students about 
the Earth from the vantage point of space. 

According to Karen Flammer — research physicist who 
holds a doctorate in space physics and serves as the primary 
faculty advisor for the EarthKAM program at UCSD — the 
main focus of the project is to get young students excited about 
science. Flammer helps develop curriculum that revolves 
around the use of the images taken by EarthKAM for middle-
school teachers and students. 

And although KAM stands for Knowledge Acquired by 
Middle Schools, elementary and high schools have also taken 
their places behind the camera.

According to Flammer, Photo requests to the EarthKAM 
Web site have included specific countries, land formations, 
weather patterns — even natural disasters. UCSD students then 
process these requests and transmit pertinent information to the 
International Space Station via NASA’s Johnson Space Center.

Based on instructional files created by the undergrads, the 
camera then snaps photographs of the Earth. These images are 
transmitted to NASA for archiving before being sent back to 

UCSD to be uploaded to the EarthKAM Datasystem.
Within 24 hours of submitting their requests, middle-school 

students can access the Datasystem to retrieve their pictures. 
According to Flammer, they have used the images for school 
projects such as tracking disaster paths, mapping land area and 
calculating the size of farmland.

The program is likewise benificial for the participating 
UCSD students, who receive specialized training while to 

facilitating the successful completion of 
each mission. As a primarily research-
funded university (cash-strapped as it 
currently may be), UCSD is most often 
touted for the cutting-edge innovations 
of its faculty and graduate students. But 
over on the first floor of the Science and 
Engineering Research Facility build-
ing, you’ll find undergraduate scien-
tists controlling a great portion of the 
background operations that make ISS 
EarthKAM so successful. Students work 
in teams dedicated to managing specific 
aspects of the program.

UCSD alumna Liz Kain, who was 
part of EarthKAM for four years before 

graduating in 2008, said the program is a valuable opportunity 
for undergraduates to be part of something substantive.

“The school team was speaking with and educating students 
from all over the world. We worked directly with people at 
Houston, at the Johnson Space Center. You could listen to the 
austronauts. We developed a program that’s actually used on the 
International Space Station! We joke about looking up in the sky 
and saying, ‘Yup, [our work] is up there.’”

Many of the participating UCSD students said they 
stumbled on the program while browsing the aerospace tab of

student chief.

Orbits Team: Using Orbit Propagation software and 
information received from NASA’s Johnson Space Cen-
ter, determines the position of the ISS and locations 
over Earth visible for taking pictures.
MOoS Team: Verifies photo requests from middle-
school students and creates camera-control files that 
tell the camera when to take pictures based on the 
tracking model determined by the Orbits Team. These 
files contain time stamps, and are transmitted to the 
JSC by the chief.
Payloads Team: Connects to the JSC servers to 
download pictures taken by the EarthKAM camera 
onto UCSD servers. Also determines time, latitude 
and longitude for each image, then uploads them
to the EarthKAM Web site for middle-school students 
to access.

School Team: Serves as a liaison between middle schools 
and ISS EarthKAM. Communicates with teachers before, 
during and after missions to facilitate requests and receipt 
of images. Also participates in outreach and education 
programs such as the Sally Ride Science Festival.
Images Team: Creates projects using the images taken 
by the EarthKAM camera. These can include stitching 
together stills to generate a panoramic image or con-
structing maps based on the photographs.

E ver since 20th Century Fox exhumed X-Men, the comic-book cash crop has been making the most of an endless harvest. In 
the past five years alone, there’s been enough 
Marvel-based movies to keep Tobey Maguire set 
for life.

Considering San Diego’s Comic-Con 
International brought in a record flock of cos-
tumed geeks this summer, it’s only fair that 
we should also house one of best comic book 
stores in SoCal — an unpretentious cache in 
Clairemont with its own MySpace, book club, 
blog and assorted collection of plastic-encased 
Stormtroopers, appropriately named Comickaze.

By the time you finish parking and lift your 
gaze towards the over-crowded window staring 
you in the face, you’ll realize that Comickaze 
isn’t nearly as genteel nor spacious as the Barnes 
& Noble you’re used to. Judging by the over-
jammed bookshelves, wire racks, countertops 
and windows, it’s outgrown its modest origins 
and opted for offbeat clutter a while ago. Boxes, 
box sets and the more popular members of 
League of Justice line the walls, while T-shirts 
with screenprints of Gabrielle from Xena (uh, I 
was 10) hang on racks propped up throughout 
the store. 

The infinite bric-a-brac, DIY crafts and 
miscellaenous merchandise are all part of 
Comickaze’s quaint appeal: offering more than 
comic books for those of us so uncommitted to 
collecting that we couldn’t tell you if $500 was a 
decent asking price for the first Venom cameo 
in the Amazing Spider-Man series. (According 
to eBay, it is.) Comics might be their specialty, 
and the first two syllables of their moniker 
— not to mention roughly 70 percent of their 
store — but they’re keen on everything from 
neon lights and glassware of Wonder Woman 
and Wolverine, to life-size busts and bookends 
of Hellboy.

In simple terms of comic books, Comickaze 
is stocked with all the extras: special editions, 
back issues and complete collections. Whether 

you’re pining the latest installment of the 
Umbrella Academy (written by Gerard Way of 
My Chemical Romance), the early issues of 
new medieval epic Mouse Guard (complete 
with signed copies) or even one of the endless 
derivatives of a Stan Lee orginal (Spider-Man 
Loves Mary Jane, Justice League: Cry for Justice), 
Comickaze’s got enough pages to keep anyone 
in the store for hours.

Bookshelves wrapping the store walls host 
most of the selection, including nearly 25 
shelves dedicated to Marvel alone. Eisner, Miller 
and Moore are a guarantee — and if there’s any-
thing you want that they don’t have, they can 
usually order it for you. 

Imagine an abridged, less-pricey version of 
Comic-Con, crammed into a midsized retail 
store — minus the tawdry Tinkerbell — you’ve 
got a pretty good idea of what Comickaze feels 
like.

The only category it loses in is manga — 
which, compared to the UCSD Bookstore, only 
takes up a single wire rack. But when you con-
sider how much you gain, it’s a small price to 
pay for a chance to escape the seedy confines of 
Price Center.

A SAPPHIRE IN THE ROUGH: YOUTUBE’S NEXT VIDEO VIXEN
BY ALYSSA BEREZNAK SENIOR STAFF WRITER

M uir College senior Daniel McDonald ended his 21st birthday party in a wedding dress, crumpled below a Residential Security Officer’s 
feet in tears — but not because he was abandoned at 
the altar. 

He’d begun the evening of Sept. 23 innocently, 
offering drinks to his guests in a corset and red tutu. 
But when his International House bash spilled out 
onto I-Walk, a couple uniformed men told everyone it 
was time to take it inside. McDonald was upset, so his 
roommate — Muir College junior Lee Montgomery — 
told him to make a statement. 

“I love that kind of thing,” McDonald said. 
“Whenever I hear that, I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, let’s do that.’”

So McDonald ran inside and threw on the $100 
wedding dress he and Montgomery had purchased 
together at a Pacific Beach thrift store. (Never mind 
that he didn’t have time to tie pillows on his legs to 
poof the dress out, as was the plan.) He grabbed a 
giant suitcase and rushed to the shutdown in hysterics, 
throwing his slender body to the ground and threaten-
ing to move out, between sobs. 

The RSOs stared on, as bystanders on balconies 
snapped photos. 

“Everyone get off I-Walk!” one RSO shouted. 
“Except for the bride. Mind the bride.”

All this from a pale, 6-foot, 128-pound blonde kid 
who calls himself an introvert.

“I never thought I [stood out] until like a year ago 
or so,” McDonald said. “I’ve always kind of dressed like 
how I feel like dressing. And then people were like, 
‘Gosh, Dan, you stand out so much.’ And I was like, ‘Do 
I, really?’” 

McDonald is hard to miss. You may have seen him 
walking to Earl’s Place covered in an amalgamation 
of rainbows. Or glimmering on Library Walk in a sil-
ver sequined wrap. His bright platinum hair matches 
his bright yellow sandals, which match his yellow 
Volkswagon Beetle, which matches a yellow loofah he 
carries around as a fashion accessory.

“People always come up to me and say, ‘Oh, I love 
your costume, where are you going?’” McDonald said. 
“And I’m like, ‘Oh, these are my clothes.’ I always like 
to try new things. I’ve worn mismatched shoes before 

on purpose. So I’ll wear a loofah as an accessory and 
maybe eventually it will catch on, and soon you’ll see a 
bunch of girls on campus matching their outfits to loo-
fahs. And I’ll be the trendsetter. Maybe. We’ll see.”

But how does one become a mastermind trendsetter 
like McDonald in the first place?

It’s a long story. 
McDonald’s parents divorced three months after 

he was born. His mother Linda — who, according to 
McDonald, looks like a Swedish supermodel — then 
swept him away to San Diego. She tried her luck at love 
again, remarrying when McDonald was six, and then 
divorcing again when he was 12. At one point, they 
shared an apartment with McDonald’s grandmother in 
a shabby El Cajon neighborhood. Eventually, with the 
help of some child support from her two ex-husbands, 
they got their own place.

But by his senior year at Grossmont High School 
in La Mesa, Linda couldn’t pay rent. One evening, the 
cops came to their apartment, threw their belongings 
on the street and changed the locks. McDonald and 
his mother slept on the street next to a mound of their 
stuff.

The next morning, McDonald took charge. He 
called a taxi and directed the driver to his grandma’s 
house.

“I was like, ‘Mom, we can’t be like living on the 
street,’” he said. “She’s not the most grounded person, 
so she kind of, like, didn’t realize what was happening. 
She’s a little eccentric.”

Around the same time, McDonald’s friend Courtney 
invited him to Monster Massive — a colossal dance 
party that draws thousands of costume-clad ravers to 
the Los Angeles Sports Arena every Halloween. He 
accepted the invitation, since he already had a ward-
robe for the occasion, and road-tripped up to LA for 
some fun. 

“I fit into it,” McDonald said. “I super fit into it. 
When I was there, I was like, ‘Wow, these are my 
people.’ Like, everyone was crazy dressed. Everyone was 
having a really good time. And everyone was happy. 
There was no arguing, you know?”

the Academic Internship Program 
database. Others are friends of friends 
who found their way to Flammer’s 
office by word of mouth.

Though AIP interns receive aca-
demic credit, some students receive 
paid scholarships, and others choose 
to volunteer.

“It gives them the experience of 
a hands-on, space-related project,” 
Flammer said. “Some even go on to 
work for NASA.”

Christie Carlile, a 2009 UCSD 
alumna, is one such student.

“I went to space camp in the 5th 
grade and that sealed the deal,” Carlile 
said.

Carlile was designated Chief of 
the UCSD Mission Operations Center 
— which is modeled after NASA’s 
Mission Control — before becoming 
a “co-op,” or participant in NASA’s 
Cooperative Education Program. The 
program offers paid positions to col-
lege students who juggle classes while 
working for NASA.

Five weeks ago, Carlile became 
a full-time employee of the Johnson 
Space Center.

Sixth College senior Allen Jiang 
began as an AIP intern one year ago, 
but elected to stay on after his quar-
ter with the Academic Internship 
Program ended.

Jiang said he feels EarthKAM pro-
vides an invaluable educational ser-
vice to participating middle schools.

“It invigorates them and gets them 
involved in learning about the Earth 
and space.”

Kain — who now works as a 
project manager at Apple but cred-
its the trajectory of her career path 
to the undergraduate experience at 
EarthKAM — agreed.

“Sometimes you get direct feed-
back from kids and you feel like you’re 
perhaps inspiring future engineers or 
scientists,” Kain said. “And even if it’s 
only one kid, it’s gratifying.”

The International Space Station 
will be visible in the early morning 
skies of San Diego from Saturday, 
Oct. 10 to Wednesday, Oct. 14. Check 
www.nasa.gov for exact times and 
durations.

Monster Massive was a night of 
many firsts for McDonald — includ-
ing, but not limited to, trying ecstasy 
and meeting his rave parents: two 
lesbians named Cupcake and Stardust. 
They dubbed him Fluid, to describe 
both his sexuality and his dance style.

Accordingly, McDonald identifies 
as pansexual — a sexual orientation 
he describes as “fluid sexuality.”

“It’s kind of like bisexual but bisex-
ual has this binary I don’t like: It limits 
you to two options,” he said. “But not 
animals. I don’t like to fuck cabbages 
or cats or anything.”

When he first arrived at UCSD, 
McDonald didn’t feel as comfort-
able showing his true colors. He said 
he dressed more conservatively and 
was still dating his high-school girl-
friend, who wasn’t too happy about 
his pansexuality. After their midyear 
breakup, he joined several Muir 
College organizations and became 
more flamboyant. 

But McDonald’s pinnacle of fame 
came when he spent a year abroad, 
from June 2007 to January 2008, in 
Sweden. With a new webcam and 
some free time on his hands, Swedish 
Sapphire (a stage character named 
after his national heritage and birth-
stone) was born. McDonald filmed 
steamy remakes of whatever song 
he dug at the time — mostly of the 
Britney and Gaga nature — with a 
tiny camera, some careful angling and 
lots of costumes changes.

“I always thought Chris Crocker 
was cool,” McDonald said. “He makes 
these crazy videos and then he posts 
them on YouTube. I figured I could 
too. And so I did. And I definitely 
advertised it.”

One day, he joined the Swedish 
YouTube network, and suddenly 
became a mini-celebrity. His view 
count shot to 1,800, and at one point 
he held the No. 10 ranking on the 

country’s network. People even began 
to recognize him in public. 

Since then, McDonald has made 
about 34 videos — some of which all 
his family and friends have viewed 
(grandma got a peak at Thanksgiving 
dinner). Though he hasn’t reached 
Crocker’s celebrity status, he’s still rec-
ognized locally.

“Last week, I was coming back 
form Earl’s Place, and this group of 
frat guys way behind me was like, 
‘Swedish Sapphire, turn around,’” he 
said. “I waved and they were like, ‘K, 
cool, thanks.’”

Although McDonald hopes to 
continue filming projects on the side 
after he becomes an opthamologist 
(he interned with an eye doctor this 
summer and plans to apply to medi-
cal school in 2011), he understands 
his side job might be difficult for his 
patients to swallow.

“I’m worried because once I get up 
to a professional level its going to be 
hard,” McDonald said. “It might not 
be as accepting as it is now. And if the 
old lady whose eyes I’m fixing sees 
me on the Internet half-naked and is 
like, ‘Wait, that’s my eye doctor,’ that 
might be a bit of a shock.”

In the meantime, though, 
McDonald is waiting to hear back 
from Rich’s and Numbers — two gay 
clubs at which he auditioned for a 
go-go dancing position earlier this 
year. You never know when the next 
wedding dress tantrum will precipitate 
— rumor has it McDonald is planning 
on a fishnet-clad weight-lifting session 
at RIMAC sometime this year. 

“I really like to have people ques-
tion reality and the norm,” he said. 
“People live their mundane, everyday 
life, and all of a sudden they see some 
crazy drag queen running out of a 
tree, and its like, ‘Whoa.’”

Middle-school students use the 
EarthKAM Web site to submit 
photo requests, which are received 
by UCSD undergrads.
UCSD students group the requests 
together based on location. They 
then use student-programmed soft-
ware to generate Camera Control 
Files that instruct the camera when 
to take the photographs. These files 
are sent to NASA’s Johnson Space 
Center in Houston, Texas.
NASA verifies the CCFs and uplinks 
them to a laptop located in the Destiny 
Lab of the International Space Station.
The laptop reads the files and con-
trols the EarthKAM camera, which 
snaps the requested images at the 
times specified by the files.

The unprocessed photographs are 
transmitted from the ISS to the 
JSC, where they are sent to UCSD’s 
Mission Control Center — as well as 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab.
The Jet Propulsion Lab archives the 
photographs for NASA.
UCSD students upload the images 
to the Datasystem, a searchable 
online database on the EarthKAM 
Web site.
The UCSD Orbits Team uses the 
images to check for any miscalcula-
tions, and the Images Team does 
projects based on the photographs.
Middle-school students access their 
requested images from the Earth-
KAM Web site and can use them in 
class activities.

At the start of the second half, 
UC Davis got on the board when 
Matt Richardson converted on a 
man-up opportunity — only to have 
Madsen answer back with a goal of 
his own at the 4:17 mark, regaining 
UCSD’s lead. After the two teams 
traded goals again, with under three 
minutes remaining in the third, the 
Tritons entered the final period 
clinging to a 6-5 lead. 

In a nail-biting fourth quarter, 
senior utility Ian Bausback gave the 
Tritons a two-point advantage. The 
Aggies would find the net twice, 
more, however, tying the game for 
the fourth time when Colin Hicks 
punched in a five-meter penalty 
shot at the 2:45 mark. 

Refusing to yield to the Davis 
upswing, the Tritons put together 
a late surge when seniors Steven 
Donohoe and Roberts scored at the 
2:25 and the 1:16 marks, respec-

tively, to seize a victory.  
“Everyone on the team stepped 

up — it was a total team focus,” 
Gresham said. “We had our first 
and second line both play really well 
tonight, and we were going six-for-
six the whole game. This time, we 
were able to press a man and get 
the counterattack going the whole 
time. Everyone put forth that effort. 
When you know that the guy next to 
you is swimming hard, you have to 
swim hard too.”  

The victory against UC Davis 
drives the Tritons into a stretch of 
five games over a three-day period, 
against some of the nation’s top   
programs, from Oct. 9 through Oct. 
11. 

After playing Chapman 
University in Orange, Calif., the 
Tritons will open the UC Irvine 
Invitational on Oct. 10 against 
Loyola Marymount University. 
The LMU Lions have been UCSD’s 

toughest opponent recently: They 
have won all of the last eight games 
between the two teams, dating back 
to the 2006 season.

The remaining competition at 
the invitational will be just as chal-
lenging. The Tritons enter a tour-
nament pool that includes pere-
nial national powerhouses No. 
1 Stanford University, No. 4 Cal 
Berkley and No. 8 Pepperdine. 

Madsen recognized the need to 
take the tournament’s first game 
in order to set the tone for their 
remaining matches. 

“It’s always important to win that 
first game so we can play with better 
teams,” Madsen said. “In the south-
ern california tournament, there’s 
always a lot of good teams — so we 
hope to go out there, play hard and 
get within those top-10 rankings.” 

Readers can contact Brianna Lee at 
bmlee@ucsd.edu.

After the goal, UCSD’s defense 
continued to shut out Sonoma State, 
and the Tritons held out for a 1-0 
victory.

“Tonight, I thought we moved 
off the ball well,” junior midfielder 
Lisa Bradley said. “I thought we had 
heart and wanted to win this game.  
We kept the intensity up the whole 
90 minutes.”

With the victory, the Tritons’ 
record improves to 8-2 overall, with 
a 6-2 record in CCAA play. This 
was the third-straight win for the 
Tritons, who have won six out of 
their last seven matches. The victo-
ry also extends UCSD’s dominance 
over Sonoma State, having taken 
13-straight victories since 2000.

UCSD continued its home stand 
with a match against Humboldt State 
on Oct. 4, winning 2-1 to improve 
its season record to 9-2. The Triton 
goals were netted by freshman for-
ward Gabi Hernandez, sophomore 
forward Courtney Capobianco and 
freshman defender Hayley Johnson, 
en route to a 3-1 victory. 

UCSD has scored 22 goals 
throughout its first 10 games this 
season. The Triton’s leading scorer is 
sophomore forward Sarah McTigue, 
who holds four of the Tritons’ 22 
goals. 

The lack of a dominant scorer 
this season is a huge departure from 
last season, when former Triton 
senior forward Natasha Belak-
Berger was the unquestioned leader 
of the team’s offense with 13 goals — 
one-third of the team’s total scoring 
— and three assists, for a total of 29 
points. In contrast to last year, fresh-
man midfielder Jessica Wi leads the 
2009 Tritons with nine points with 
just under half of the season having 
already been played.

Though the team has no domi-
nant star, Bradley is confident in its 

ability to play as a balanced set of 
players and continue to improve as 
the CCAA championship playoffs 
on Nov. 6 draw closer.

“Our team has improved so 
much over the last couple of weeks,” 
Bradley said. “From the defense to 

the midfield to the forwards, every-
thing is definitely starting to come 
together. We are starting to feel 
comfortable with each other.”

DANIEL CADDELL/GUARDIAN
Sophomore forward Sarah McTigue has been one of the few UCSD players to put up any crooked 
offensive numbers this season, recording eight points on four goals in 25 shots.

the Phillies, whose closer followed 
up a perfect 2008 season by going 
0-8 with an ERA over seven and 11 
blown saves. Added to the Phil’s wor-
ries are the fact that a 102-year-old 
Jamie Moyer leads the team with 
12 wins, and that Cole Hamels has 
more losses (11) than wins (10). If 
Charlie Manuel’s defending World 
Champions are going to make a run 
at another title, they will need veteran 
players like Jimmy Rollins and Cliff 
Lee to lead the charge and get the city 
of brotherly love charged up.

As for the Rockies, they have a 
real knack for miracle runs. Somehow 
topping 2007’s magical sprint to the 
World Series, the 2009 Rocks came 
within two days of win-
ning the NL West and will 
glady enter the playoffs as 
the wild-card winner. On 
June 3 the Rockies were 15 
1/2 games out of first place 
before Jim Tracy took over 
as manager and lead his 
team to a 73-40 record to 
finish out the season. After 
trading away franchise 
player Holliday in the off-
season, Colorado’s offense 
was buoyed by all-star 
shortstop Troy Tulowitzki 
and the ageless Todd 
Helton to slug 189 home 
runs — second-best in the 
NL. The main concern 
for the mile-highers is whether their 
young rotation can hold up under 
pressure. But with Jason Giambi’s 
mustache and gold thong waiting on 
the bench, the Rockies will surely 
provide some late-game theatrics. 

Blanc’s pick: Phillies in five games.
American League:
Detroit Tigers/Minnesota Twins vs. 

New York Yankees
Thanks to the Twins’ late-season 

push (and the Tiger’s inability to 
close out the AL Central), baseball 
fans are now treated to a one-game 
playoff to determine who takes on 
the New York Yankees in the AL 
Division Series. In what could pos-
sibly be the final baseball game ever at 
Minneapolis’ Metrodome, the Twins 
will look to continue their September 
surge against a Tiger’s club that has 
controlled the division all season. 
Justin Verlander was needed Sunday 
to force Tuesday’s playoff, which 
means the charge now falls on one of 
Detroit’s rookie pitchers to contain 
Minnesota’s offensive attack. How 
Joe Mauer, the leading candidate for 
American League MVP, performs will 
be a primary factor in deciding the 
outcome between the two Midwest 
rivals.

Awaiting the winner of the 
Tigers-Twins game are the New York 
Yankees, who responded to last sea-
son’s absence from the playoffs (the 
first time in 12 years) by spending 
$243.5 million on three free agents. 
Apparently money can buy you 
love — or at least a playoff berth — 

because the Yanks find themselves 
with the best record in baseball. How 
did the spending-spree babies per-
form in 2009? CC Sabathia won 20 
games, Mark Teixiera led the team in 
home runs (32) and RBIs (122) and 
A.J. Burnett struck out 195 batters in 
207 innings. Money well-spent, Mr. 
Steinbrenner. With Mariano Riviera 
getting even more unhittable as he 
approaches AARP eligibility, the 
Yankees are as threatening as they 
have been all decade.

Blanc’s pick: Yankees in four 
games.

Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. 
Boston Red Sox

Ever since the Angels destroyed 
every fiber in my being with their 

comeback win in the 
2002 World Series 
against the Giants, the 
Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim’s Pasadena 
section of Laguna 
Beach have only won 
a single playoff series, 
seemingly losing in 
the Division Series 
every year to the very 
same team they face 
this year: the Red Sox. 
Following the tragic 
death of pitcher Nick 
Adenhart on April 9, 
the Halos have quietly 
put together an incred-
ibly strong season. First 

baseman Kendry Morales has grown 
into one of the most well-rounded 
hitters in the game, and closer 
Brian Fuentes filled the spot left by 
Francisco Rodriguez after his record-
setting 2008 season with 48 saves of 
his own to stabilize the Angel’s bull-
pen. The fact that on Aug. 18 all nine 
Angels starters were batting over .300 
is an ominous sign for any opposing 
pitchers in the playoffs.

It took David Ortiz 149 at-bats 
to hit his first home run of the year 
for Boston, but a career year from 
outfielder Jason Bay and the acqui-
sition of Victor Martinez lent the 
Sox enough support to stave off the 
Rangers and claim the AL wild card. 
Starting pitcher Josh Beckett could 
never quite find a rhythm and an 
effective Daisuke Matsuzaka proved 
to be as much of a myth as his gyrob-
all, leaving the young Jon Lester to 
anchor a pitching staff that, at times, 
buckled under the weight of the AL 
East. Unless Curt Schilling takes a 
break from his campaign for the U.S. 
Senate to re-bloody his sock, Boston 
is going to have a hard time getting 
out of the first round.

Blanc’s pick: Angels in four 
games.

So there you have it: foolproof 
predictions on who will make it to 
the NL and AL championship series. 
So call your bookies, place some bets 
and tune in again before the League 
Championship Series for the next 
installment of Blanc’s picks for the 
rest of the playoffs.

Unless Curt 
Schilling takes 
a break from 
his campaign 
for the U.S. 
Senate to 
re-bloody his 
sock, Boston is 
going to have a 
hard time 
getting out of 
the ﬁrst round.

“I don’t know if we were ready 
going into that match,” Black said. 
“We had a good week of practice and 
game-planned well, but I’m not sure 
if we were there mentally. I just kind 
of reset and thought about what we 
needed to do after that.”

UCSD held on to win the third set 
25-20 before battling out a fourth set 
to finish off Cal State Monterey Bay 
for the victory. The Tritons jumped to 
a 7-4 lead, but the Otters responded 
with a strong counter-run to take a 
16-13 lead. 

After a timeout, the Tritons briefly 
reclaimed the lead — before falling 
behind 24-23. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Katie Condon came off the bench 
and scored a quick hit to tie the game. 
After Cal State Monterey Bay fumbled 
the next point, senior captain out-
side hitter Sylvia Schmidt notched 
her final and match-leading 15th kill 
to capture the 26-24 victory for the 
Tritons.

Saturday night, UCSD had no 
trouble dispatching San Francisco 
State, sweeping three straight sets, 
25-15, 25-17 and 25-17. The Gators’ 
only lead of the night came when they 
took the first point in the second game 
for a quick 1-0 edge.

However, the game was all UCSD 
from then on, as Schmidt paced the 
Tritons to a dominant win by notch-
ing16 kills on .583 hitting. 

“We were ready to go,” Black said. 
“We weren’t going to make the same 
mistake as Friday. We served tough, 
and our blockers were pretty good 
about doing what they were trying 
to do. We just closed off any lanes for 
them to hit through.”

UCSD goes on the road next 
weekend to face CCAA opponents 
Humboldt State on Oct. 9 and Sonoma 
State on Oct. 10.

Men’s Water Polo — For the second 
time in the past two weeks, the 
No. 13 men’s water polo team took 
down conference rival UC Davis 
with an impressive 9-7 victory on 
Oct. 2 at the Coggan Family Aquatic 
Center. 

The Tritons’ record now stands 
at 6-7 for the season, while the No. 
12 Aggies dropped to 9-5. 

“This was a big win in terms of 
confidence, and in terms of how our 
season has been going,” senior two-
meter defender Peter Gresham said. 
“It’s important for us to see results 
for how hard we’ve been working in 
practice.” 

The Tritons’ well-fought match 
serves as a heartening sendoff:  
UCSD takes to the road all next 
week, facing Chapman University 
on Oct. 9 before participating in the 
UC Irvine Invitational Oct. 10 and 
Oct. 11.

“After last week, when we lost 
to [Loyola Marymount], that was 
tough — so we wanted to come out 
and get this win to feel confident 

going into our southern california 
tournament next week,” senior driv-
er Bryce Madsen said. “[This] was a 
rival game too, so you always want 
to get the win just so that when 
it comes to [Western Water Polo 
Association] rankings, we’re ahead 
of them, and we have the easy way 
into the final.”

Before triumphing in their 9-7 
win over the Aggies, the Tritons got 
off to a sluggish start, facing down a 
3-0 deficit in the first period. 

However, Madsen turned in a 
solid performance, tallying three 
goals for UCSD — the first of which 
came at the 2:15 mark of the first 
quarter, putting the Tritons on the 
board. 

“Sometimes you’ve just got to get 
that first one in,” head coach Denny 
Harper said. “I think that helped 
because it was like, ‘OK, we’re not 
shooting at a brick wall here.’ No 
offense at Davis. Their defense is not 
as strong as [Loyola Marymount]. 
With two teams ranked side by side 
in the national rankings, that’s gen-
erally what happens. Essentially, the 
game went as I expected, and I’m 
glad we came out on top.” 

After a scoreless first five min-
utes of the second quarter, the 
Tritons took a timeout to regroup 
— a strategy that would ultimate-
ly change the tempo of the game 
in their favor. Senior driver Sean 
Roberts scored immediately after 
breaking the huddle, while a six-on-
five opportunity at the 1:19 mark 
resulted in Madsen’s second goal of 
the game. 

With the game tied at 3-3, 
Gresham fired just before the end of 
the half, putting the Tritons up by a 
delicate 4-3 lead. 

“On our man-ups, they basically 
left me open,” Madsen said. “I try 
to help my team in any way, so if 
they’re going to leave me open, I’m 
going to shoot it.”

T       he 2009 baseball season was an interesting one. Aside from Randy Johnson win-
ning his 300th game, there were no 
major records broken (my apologies 
to Mark Reynolds, but re-setting your 
own single-season strikeout record 
isn’t exactly reason to celebrate). A 
pair of lefty pitchers who had lost a 
combined 20 games still managed to 
throw a no-hitter and a perfect game. 

No pitcher won 20 games on the sea-
son for only the second time in base-
ball history. Three of baseball’s biggest 
sluggers — Alex Rodriguez, Manny 
Ramirez and David Ortiz — got 
caught using performance-enhancing 
drugs and now are living proof that 
baseball forgives everyone not named 
Barry by helping their teams win in 
the playoffs. 

At least we had Milton Bradley’s 
annual meltdown to reassure us that 
no matter how much changes in base-
ball, some things never will.

The regular season has wrapped 
up, meaning that the time of the year 
we’ve all been waiting for is finally 
here. With the Division Series start-
ing this week, the playoffs are upon 
us. So, with no further delay, I pres-
ent the “Blanc On Base” 2009 MLB 
Division Series predictions:

National League:
Los Angeles Dodgers vs. St. Louis 

Cardinals
Despite having the best record 

in the National League, the Dodgers 
limp into the postseason after almost 
surrendering the NL West with a 
five-game losing streak in the season’s 
final week. Matt Kemp and Andre 
Ethier posted monster numbers to 
pace LA to a team batting average 
of .270, but Manny the Tranny’s fall 
from offensive grace has resulted 
in some serious trouble at Chavez 
Ravine. The Dodgers’ probable play-
off rotation gives manager Joe Torre a 
roadblock he never quite had in New 
York. How far can a team go when 
Randy Wolf is your game one starter 
and your choices for game three 
include Jon Garland and Vicente 
Padilla?

The Cardinals, on the other hand, 
have a rotation anchored by Chris 
Carpenter and Adam Wainwright, 
two pitchers who will finish top 
three in the Cy Young race. With Joel 
Piniero performing well from the No. 
3 spot and a breakout year from new 
closer Ryan Franklin, St. Louis eas-
ily gets the edge over LA in pitching. 
As for offense, the Cardinals’ lineup 
may not be as well-balanced as the 
Dodgers’, but with all-universe first 
baseman Albert Pujols finally hav-
ing protection from outfielder Matt 
Holliday, the Cards are going to put 
up more than enough runs for man-
ager Tony La Russa. 

Blanc’s pick: Cardinals in four 
games.

Philadelphia Phillies vs. Colorado 
Rockies

How can you have four players 
with over 30 home runs and two Cy 
Young-winning pitchers on your staff 
and still enter the Division Series 
with serious doubts? Just look at

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Throughout the 2009 season, 
UCSD has been unable to find a consistent goal-scorer: 
Nine different players have scored no more than four 
times. With only one senior on the team, no Triton in 
particular has been counted on to put the ball in the net. 

This trend continued at UCSD’s Oct. 2 match against 
conference rival Sonoma State. This time, the player 
who provided UCSD’s game-winning goal came as an 
unexpected surprise to all those on the field: a Sonoma 
defender.

UCSD began its critical four-match home stand — all 
against California Collegiate Athletic Association rivals 
— by squeaking past Sonoma State 1-0. In their first 
home match since Sept. 13, the Tritons emerged victori-
ous, thanks in part to a solid defense and a fluke play 
that yielded the game’s lone goal.

“We weathered the storm,” head coach Brian 
McManus said. “We didn’t create as much as we would 
have liked to. Sometimes you’ve got to be able to win 
ugly, and tonight we won ugly.”

UCSD outshot the Seawolves 11-9, an impressive 
show that was sullied by the fact that not one of 11 shots 
made it into the net. In the end, however, their inability 
to score did not derail the Tritons’ winning chances. 

The game’s only goal came late in the 44th minute, 
off a free kick by freshman defender Ellen Wilson. A 
Seawolf defender received Wilson’s kick, and — in try-
ing to clear the ball out of the goal box — accidentally 
headed it straight into her own net.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL —  
Coming off five-straight conference 
victories, the UCSD women’s volley-
ball team welcomed two more games 
against a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association opponent last weekend 
looking to improve on its reputation 
as the No. 3 team in the nation. 

The Tritons continued their torrid 
run through conference play over two 
weekend games at RIMAC Arena, 

seizing two more victories over Cal 
State Monterey Bay and San Francisco 
State on Friday and Saturday nights — 
improving their season record to 16-1 
overall, 8-1 CCAA.

Entering Friday’s game, the Tritons 
had never lost a game to Cal State 
Monterey Bay, holding a perfect 
10-0 record against the Otters. The 
match began as the Otters and Tritons 
exchanged the lead six times early on, 
neither team asserting full control. 

After the Tritons called a time-
out to recover their composure, they 

returned with resolve and quickly 
storming to a 24-22 lead, using strong 
blocks and defensive plays to shut 
down the Otters’ attacks. 

At game point, the Otters quickly 
notched a service ace and a kill to tie 
the match up again, at 26-26. With the 
first game in jeopardy, UCSD slipped, 
giving up two points with a service 
error and hitting error that handed 
the game to the Otters.

“They have a really complicated 
offense, and it was really tough to 
defend against,” head coach Tom 

Black said. “They could keep putting 
up points, and we knew we would 
have to adjust.”

But the Tritons overcame their 
early service errors and played a 
dominant second game to reclaim 
the match’s momentum. Two strong 
kills from redshirt-freshman middle 
blocker Julia Freidenberg gave UCSD 
a quick 11-point lead at 19-8. 

The team cruised to close out the 
second game 25-10.
