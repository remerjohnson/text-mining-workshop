the problems which the 
students brought to the 
University 's attention. York 
said that " there is a history of

students and police across this

documented." York added that 
the Republican National 
Convention in San Diego makes 
the problem particularly

University of California , San Diego 
Rick Drom 

If UCSD does not take "affirmative action" to 
correct the current underrepresentation of 
minorities and women employed at UCSD. it 
could lose 40 per cent of its operating funds . 
This finding wa sent to all department 
chairmen last month in a letter marked . 
URGE T. from the chancellor. Mr. Halcomb 
Halliman, contract compliance specialist at 

L~e Department of Health. Education and 
Welfare told the TRITON TIMES that " if a 
university, like UCSD, failed to develop an 
effective affirmative action program. this 
would be grvunds for cancellation of all tuture 
federal grants." which at CSD total 40 million 
dollars a year . 

"Equai employment opportunity is nothing 
new." Dr. Phil James . Executive Assistant to 
the Chancellor. said . "but the Affirmative 
Action Program i new. And the use of an 
affirmative action program at the niversity of 
California i newer still. " For many year 

c~lIeges and universities have had to ' compl\' 
WIth federal employment rules in order to 
qualify to receive federal grants. But it was not 
until recently that HEW began investigating 
campuse to determine compliance with th 
law and the implem ntation of the Affirmative 
Action Program. 

U. of Michigan Examined 
Affirmative Action is the term used for action 

taken to insure equal opportunity for all 
regardless of race or sex. The niver ity of 
Michigan was one of the first campu es which 
HEW examined. It requested that univer ity to 
achieve sa lary for all equitv and to employ a 
greater percentage of women. The University 
of Michigan resisted and called the demands 
" totally unreasonable," according to ScieDce 
magazine. They complained that thiS type of 
action would entail a monumental amount of 
book work to determine what percentage of 
women should be hired and would also tend "to 
lower the standard of the university. "As 
Science said. "Such arguments . were 
reminiscent of respon e offered by employers 
during the early part of the civil right 
movemen t. " Other ca mpu ses reacted 
differently. The Univer ity of Illinois. for 
example. " worked quietly toward an 
acceptable affirmative action plan for women." 

Affirmative action taken for women came to 
the niversity of California ystem la t pring 
when the Subcommittee on the Statu of 
Academic Women of the Berkeley campus 
made its report public. This report showed that 
"women are not yet accepted at Berkeley on an 
equal basis." It further reported that "there is 
thus substantial evidence that the woman who 
tries to pursue an academic career at Berkele. 
finds her eIr facing many of the ame problem 
and barriers that confront member of an 
ethnic minority." The report went on to sugge t 
corrective action. some of which was taken. 

On ·ov . 3. 1970. President harle Hitch 
stated the University' position on Affirmativ 
Action. " It is the policy of the niver ity to 
initiate comprehen iv writt n affirmativ 
action prolZrams for fair employment and to 
provide applicant and employees the right to 
equal employment opportunitie . The 
University will not ngage in di criminator~' 
practice again t any per on employed or 
seeking emplo~'ment becau e of race : color : 
relillion : maritial statu : national origin : sex : 
citizenship : 01 aile. within the limits imposed bv 
law and Universit~' rejZulations." 

Interim AAP Developed 
An interim Affirmative Action Program was 

developed by UCSD last spring. This program 
was instituted on June 23, 1971. In developing 
this program an affirmative action committee, 
which is now chaired by physics professor 
William Fraiser, was formed . In addition an 
acting affirmative action coordinator. Dr. Phil 
James, and an affirmative action monitor , Jack 
Douglass, assistant to the Chancellor. were 
named. The program is "a flex ible. result -
oriented program." Its goal is that the " UCSD 
population should tend to approximate the 
larger surrounding popu lation in the 
distribution of uch characteri tics as race. 
color, and sex." In order to implement these 
goals, 1960 census data figures will be u ed as a 
basis for comparison becau e 1970 figures were 
not yet available. Another important item is 
that " both the coordinator and the monitor 
should be free to devote full-time to the A.A. 
program, and should have adequate staff 
assistance and supporting budget. " 

On Aug. 17. 1971. HEW told C D that it 
would be coming here to determine the extent of 
our A.A. commitment. A Jame later 
explai ned . this was very short notice to give for 
an investigation of this size. ormally it take 
about six weeks to gather the necessary data . 
A.A. monitor Dougla wa on vacation. a wa 
his ecretary. He was the one who COl.:J best 
deal with the proper figures . But instead of 
taking six weeks, the data was gathered in two 
da . Unfortunately. as Dr. James said . "There 
were many errors in the report. " Some of the 
errors were caused by computer error. 
Dougla s later related . but ome of the errors 
were cau ed by misinterpreting the data . 

HEW Find Deficience 
Nevertheless. Herman John on. Vice-

Chancellor of Busines and Finance. oon 
received a letter from HEW with the result of 
their investigation. The report commended th 
Univer ity in some area . ul:h a the 
Disadvantaged Employees Development 
Program. but noted deficiencie in other area 
HEW recommended that : 1, two affirmattve 
action coordinator hould be appointed . one for 
ktcademic emplovees. one for non-academic : 21 
an immediate stud v of each academic 
department should be undertaken to determine 
the extent of und rrepresentation : 31

developed and submitt d to HEW :41 
recruitment procedures for all mploye s

Statistics of unemployment, 
always going up ; statistics for 
job opportunity, always going 
down. The actual numbers are 
unimportant ; the total concept 
is what counts. 

According to Dr. George 
Burchill of CEPS, it is

approaches to making the

Affirmative Action .. 
Continued from page 1 

Currently the figures . according to ·Douglass. 
are still below the national average [or the 
campus as a whole. Non-academic minorities 
compose about 17 per cent of our campus 
employees. Academic minorities compose a bit 
over 10 per cent. for a total minority ratio tor 
both around 15 per cent. But some departments 
have a much more balanced ratio than others. 
For example. the Med ical School and hospital 
are much higher than Scripps Institute. which is 
"significantly befow average." according to the 
statistics supplied by Douglass. 

Unfortunately. if one examines where women 
and minorities are employed in these 
departments, even the best sta tistics become 
less favorable . according to Douglass. 
"Usually. where minorities are employed. they 
occupy the .positions with the lowest pay." 
According to James. "There are 315 faculty 
members in the regular ranks. ladder positions. 
at the three colleges at UCSD: 10 are women. 
There are 105 regular positions at the Medical 
School: two are women. There are 58 regular 
positions at Scripps : none arp women." _ 

More Women in Non-Science Areas 
Regular positions include professors , 

associate professors, assistant professors and 
instructors. As the Berkeley study reported , 
though, more women graduate with Ph .D.'s in 
fields such as literature than in the more 
scientific fields . James suggests that these 
figures be viewed with this in mind. 

suggestion~ . In an Oct. 15 letter to HEW by 
Herman Johnson. some general outlines of the 
Affirmati ve Action Program at UCSD were 
brought out. In some cases Affirmative Action 
will not succeed, with regard to women. 
because for example there are no provisions for 
women to live at sea . Such jobs as crew on sea· 
going ships were mentioned. Other jobs are 
very difficult to balance the male-female ra tio 
because of "cultural and historical traditions 
which direct sex " into nursing, for example. In 
response to the seventh area which the HEW 
letter mentioned. Johnson's letter replied , " We 
are convinced that the Administrative Assistant 
classification presents a clearly identifiable 
stepping stone to fema le employees for 
promotion to more responsible positions. " 
which current statistics verify. The letter also 
to ld HEW that the University will continue to 
advertise under "help wanted" instead of under 
" male" or "female." Also the University will 
" give wider pUblicity to promotional 
opportunities with the University, emphasizing 
the fact that sex discrimination will not be 
permitted." In addition the University "will 
institute more active recruiting efforts to 
increase the number of the women in 
cia sifications with less than 1:3 and male-only 
classes. " 

'0 Specific Plan 
But the University was not able to give a 

specific plan for affirmative action among the 
non-academic employees becau e of a lack of 
time. According to Johnson the program will be 
"hopefully implemented by Jan. 1. 1972." 

and is currently trying to work out a program. 
He has also written to HEW and received an 
extension until Nov. 19. 

Last Friday Mr. Holliman of HEW in San 
Francisco told the TRITON TIMES that they 
are currently " very satisfied" with the 
progress which UCSD is making toward the 
development o[ an effective a[firmative action 
program to remedy job segregation by sex . 
They are currently awaiting definite goals and 
timetables which the University has promised 
to send. So the HEW letter sent on Aug. 20 
seems to be just about " wrapped up." But a 
larger question still remains to be answerP.d . 
" What will our Affirmative Action Program 
finally look like and what will it do?" Only time 
will tell but there are some indications as to 
how this Affirmative Action will proceed. 

In order fo r either the academic or the non· 
academic plan to be com pleted it will have to be 
cleared through the Advisory Committee to the 
Chancellor of Affirmative Action. Its head . 
Wi lliam Fraser. has not yet set a date for its 
next meeting. In fact som'e of the members are 
in a position such as Ted Traylor of the 
Chemistry Department. Dr. T~ay lor was 
appointed to be the AA representative from the 
Chemistry Department but currently has heard 
"absolutely nothing abo ut it. " _ 

One of the points which the HEW letter 
brought out was that of unequal retirement 
bendi ts for women. According to Herman 
Johnson this is currently being studied by the 
President of the University of California 
because it is a state matter rather than a local 
one.

Muir req'ts 
changed 

Late Tuesday the faculty of 
John Muir College 
recommended extensive 
changes in the graduation 
requirements of the college. 
Under the plan adopted by the 
faculty , which must now be 
approved by the UCSD 
Academic Senate, students 
would be able to select the 
required courses they would 
use to gradua teo 

The most important feature 
of the plan is tha t students 
would not be required to take 
language courses unless they 
want to . Under the new rules 
students would be required to 
take three course sequences in 
four out of seven areas. 

Complete details concerning 
the action taken by the Muir 
faculty and its impact on the 
college will be contained in 
Tuesday's TRITON TIMES. 

After the aforementioned data was gathered. 
letters were sent to HEW to explain the 
situa tion here on campu s and respond to HEW's 

The academic affi rmative action side of the 
letter was not as easily responded to. due to the 
complexity of the hiring process. As of this time 
Dr. James has received almost all of the 
departmental data sheets which he requested The most relaxing sleep of your

Dr. Joseph Watson has been the 
provost of Third College since July, 
1970, and bas been at UCSD since 1966. 
He states he bas been born and raised 
in Harlem, attended City College of 
New York, and received his Ph.D. in 
organic chemistry from UCLA in 1966. 
The following is a transcript of an 
interview' between Dr. Watson and 
Mark Masaoka, representing the 
TRITON TIMES, which took place 
Wednesday. 

T.T.: " Dr. Watson, could you relate 
the history of Third College up to its 
present point, and including the role of 
Angela Davis?" 

J . W.: "Well, the history is quite a 
long and complicated one, and I'd like 
to give a history at least starting with 
the time I came to this campus in 1966. 
At that time , there were

faculty member, myself. Revelle 
College was the only college ftJ full 
operation at tbat time, and I guess for 
those students and myself, there was a 
fair degree of concern and to some 
extent alienation from the campus. We 
felt isolated and in some respects, like 
a colored spot on a Kleenix tissue. 
Almost immediately, mainly from the 
initiation of the students, an effort was 
made to increase the number 01 
minority students on campus by 
recruitment and the establishment 01 
recruitment programs. I guess the 
first was I.M.R. , the Informational , 
Motivational and Recruitment 
program established by Black and 
Chicano students . • 

"One of the interesting things was 
that the first day I came on campus, 
the first person who spoke to me as a 
student was Angela Davis on a Sunday. 
From those initial efforts of minority 
students, it just expanded as initial 
policy after the increase in th~ num~r 
of minority students on campus. I think 
that next year they may have brought 
in 16 students and in the following year 
32 and the next year maybe 80, and that 
was the main area in which people 
concentrated their efforts. The second 
priority was tbe question 01 
establishing representation, I?roper 
representation of Blacks and Chicanos 
:'1 the academic program. 

"This was first tried in regards to 
Revelle College, in the humanities 
sequence, in which at that time the 
only coverage of minorities was in the 
present age quarter of th~ ~evelle 
humanities sequence. In thiS It was 
inadequate because the minorities who 
were covered. particularly blacks, 
were covered as an urban problem, as 
a social problem and not so much as a 
cultural group with a culture and 
history that was worthy of 
consideratioa to study. 

"So efforts were made to recnlit 

=

udtbeflnt ..... 1nM ........ 

wu &lit ..... 1 .... tla cammiu. 

I 

to recruit Black faculty in the area of 
Black studies. That was the major 
breakthrough because certain faculty 
positions were made available for any 
department that could fill the criteria 
and it was good in the sense that it 
enabled Blacks and other minorities in 
general to work with the 
administration towards specific goals 
with a certain degree of resources 
already committed to an objective. 

"I think that to a considerable extent 
that was to the credit of the 
administration at that time and the 
faculty through the academic senate, 

because it was a clear statement of 
committment, and in a sense, putting 
the money where one's mouth is, it 
worked very well, at least as a starting 
point, and it permitted. ~lack ~tudents 
to work with the admmlstrallon With 
some degree of confidence, in their 
committment to certain things . 

"Unfortunately, the process didn't 
work as well as one would have liked, 
ar,d essentially only one appointment 
was made as the result of our goals and 
efforts. Then we continued the efforts 
to get better representation and more 
involvement in Revelle College 
programs and also at Muir College. 
The immediate success which 
occurred first , in Muir College, was 
one in which one was able to offer 
African culture positions, as far as the 
Muir College lower division cultural 
traditions sequence. That was the first 
real offering of minority-type course 
on campus. 

" However, the progress wasn't 
really rapid enough, and to make a 
long story short , when frustratio~s 
were just building up, and when we did 
not really feel that there was a 
program on campus which would 
really be with Black and Chicano roots, 
the efforts, the mechanisms for 
bringing minority faculty were not 
really strong enough, not really 
effective enough to make real 
progress. 

"When Provost Rappaport, who was 
then provost of Third College, made 
the request for the second or third time 
that Black and ' Chicano students be 
involved in the planning of Third 
Coli.,. it was tbouPt by almost 
everybody, Bllcks and Chicanos, that 
one had to try to make a major cbanae 
in the arraDlements or relationships 
between the minorities and the 
ItnJclure of the campus. The deciJioll w.. made &0 attempt to tel major 

representation in the operation of 
Third Col1p-ge, and to orient Third 
College heavily towards Blacks', 
Chicanos' and other minorities needs. 

"This change was stated or 
advocated in the Lumumba·Zapata 
demands which I think, although it 
isn't referred to very much, is a very 
good statement of the type of things 
that minorities were feeling at the 
time and which minorities wanted 
from their Umversity education. Some 
people may say it's a rhetorical 
document, but it's a political 
document, and a very good document 
which does guide the college in its 
develppment. I tblDk that if the College 
can meet half of the preface listed in 
that document, we would have made a 
major contribution to our education in 
general and to minority higher 
education in particular. 

"Angela Davis, for the lime she was 
here, had a major impact upon 
students, particularly black students. 
She's had an impact upon the writing of 
the Lumumba-Zapata demands, and 
I'm very much proud she was a student 
here, and I think she made 
contributions to this campus which 
very few other people would have 
made. I think it's very unfortunate, 
that somebody with her capabilities 
and her abilities to contribute to 
minorities, is now in the type of 
situation that she's in, and to a 
considerable extent , . I suspect 
unjustifiably so." 

"the academic program ... 
we're not as successful as 
we'd I ike to be" 

T.T.: " How do you think the College 
is developing with regard to its original 
intents and goals?" 

J .W.: " With some success and some 
failures or shortcomings. If you look at 
it in terms of gross types of 
considerations, as the bringing in of an 
increasing number of minority 
students on campus, it's succeeding in 
that respect. An increasing number of 
minority faculty on campus ; it 's 
succeeding in that respect. Certainly 
the number of minority faculty would 
be much lower if it were not for Third 
College. We still have a long way to go 
in that respect. I think the number of 
minority sta ff has been substantially 
increased by Third College. But this 
still is a miniscule number. , 

"As far as the academic program is 
concerned , I think we' re moving in the 
right direction, but we 're really not as 
successful there as we'd like to be. 
There are a lot of areas we would like 
to strengthen programs in, to really 
orient them more to the nontraditional 
approach and at the same time, 
guarantee that the students are 
provided with good content, good 
skills, ana the students are competitive 
on these skills and be prepared to do 
the the kinds of things they want to 
after college. I think we are still 
making progress there." 

T.T.: " In which d,irections do you see 
the College moving towards, such as 
new programs?" 

J.W.: "Several new programs have 
been initiated in the hea lth sciences 
area , communications and urban 
studies, all being undergraduate 
majors. The health sciences major is 
the biology major at Third College, and 
is a premedical , predental or a biology 

major in the sense of preparilll a 
student for graduate school or for 
other activites if they do not wish to go 
to If1Iduate schoo\. The Ipproactl in

biology rather than the molecular 
approach. 

.. Another new program is 
communications, which is the social 
science analysis of communications 
media and electronic imprint and the 
formation of public opinion. The third 
program is urban and rural studies, 
which again is social science analysis 
of both urban and rural settings, not 
separated, but as an integrated and 
interrelated group and social 
phenomena. We feel that both the 
communications and urban and rural 
studies programs are directly related 
to the main thrust of the College ; that 
is, understanding society, being able to 
improve the lot of minorities in urban 
society. The urban studies in a sense 
gives one the understanding of what's 
going on, and what possible alternative 
approaches should be taken to improve 
the situation." 

T.T.: "Could you describe how this 
college is organized, in terms of where 
the power and responsibility is 
positioned?" 

J . W.: " The administrative 
responsibility for the operation of the 
college and the academic programs 
also, are the responsibility of the · 
provost. The teaching responsibility of 
various courses lies with the faculty , 
and the faculty and academic program 
is divided into four areas : 
Communications and Urban and Rural 
Studies, which we hope will go into 
departmental statis ; and Third World 
Studies and Science and Technology." 

"we've seen very little 
white hostility" 

T.T.: " Can you comment further on 
the Board of Directors?" 

J .W. : "The Board of Directors, 
which presently consists of six people 
including the Provost, is a body to 
which essentially all decisions in the 
college go to. The general assembly is 
composed of all members 01 the 
college, faculty , students, staff, and 
this body represents the whole of the 
college, the real authority m t~e 
college as far as real operatIOn IS 
concerned. It makes recommendations 
to the board in regards to general 
policy matters and to specific actions, 
and the Board has the responsibility 
for carrying out those actions." 

T,T.: "Can you describe the 
relationship Third College has with 
local minority communities?" 

J .W.: "As of now, it has been 
minimal simply because most of our 
efforts have been towards getting the 
programs under way, and the 
recruitment of individual students. Our 
relationship, or at least our service to 
the minority communities has been the 
admission of minority students and 
their education. ow that the faculty i 
larger, and we have more flexibility 
and more manpower to cover a wider 
range of activitie , we will be making 
more and more contact in developing 
programs, and we are beginning to 
make the initial step at first. " 

T.T.: "There has been confusion 
ave: the Third World concept and can 
you give your own interpretation of 
Wlta . it means?" 

J .W. "Well. I can't really say what

...... ----------------------Jim Sill, How does one describe that 
thilll called "The Movement?" 
Most freshmen and 
sophomores kIIow nther little 
of this phenomenon, but to 
othen it means a great deal. It 
summons up almost mystical 
images of a once-unifled youth 
movement that confronted the 
EstabfiShment and demanded 
ehallle. It can be evoked with 
place names : Washington, 
MiSSissippi , New Hampshire, 
People's Park, Kent State. But 
if The Movement can be 
described as mass events it can 
also, more compellingly, be 
described as the setting for 
important events in many of 
o~r lives. So it is in a rambling 
new book from Little and 
Brown called, "A Name for 
Ourselves." 

" A Lolli Career" 
The book's author and 

principal subject is one Paul 
Potter. Potter has had a 
wonderfully complete 
perspective on The Movement, 
with a pedigree of political 
activity that streches from the 
time of Richard Farina (1957) 
to the heyday of Bernadine 

Dohm (1970) . He entered 
politics al. an Ulldergraduate, 
WII a civil rlChts actJvitst In 
MIsaIssIppi In the IIIIIUIleI' of 
It164, and later· beld 110 less a 
poaition thaD national..-esident 
of the Students for a 
Democratic Society (SOS). 

In an introduction, Potter 
gives the formal reasons 
behind the book. He has been 
sought out by , among others, 
Noam Chomsky to write a non -
traditional "anti - texbook" on 
the origins of political activism 
among American intellectuals. 
But it is soon clear that the 
book is no such thing. The book 
has almost no coherent thesis 
or focus . I mean, what can you 
say about a book whose first 
chapter begins, "Words have 
little meaning?" 

The book is not text, either in 
its aim or its style. Most of it 
reads like a 16-year-old's con-
versation, with the "you -
knows" taken out. The book is 
an intellectual odyssey seeking 
the cause of the Movement's 

decline. It is a battle between Americaas want most IS not 
Potter's penonal experieoce, material security, or justice, 
and !be Inblltive "oucht to be" or class ef!uality - but love. "I

faith and rejects it. 

The boot's primary appeal, 
and repulsion, is its bighly Of the Movement he says 
personal style. The book's that most of its leaders were 
introduction is written by one chasing vain imageS of glory 
Miss Leni Wildflower, with and' prestige. He remembers 

Paul Potter: "Words 
have little meaning ... 

" 

whom Potter is clearly in love. 
He admits that "Things that 
are shared are almost always 
with the same person - Leni. 
The vortex of my life is loca ted 
at one primary relationship." 
But, as she makes clear in a 
dreary few pages , Miss 
Wildflower is still obsessed 
with ideology, and the result is 
that Potter wastes time with 
repeated ritualistic bows to 
Women's Lib. 

various " projects " and 
"campaigns" he led, trying to 
find the reason for decay , but 
is unable to. 

Yet if Potter does not know, 
the reader does in watching the 
convolutions of his thought. 
Here is a man of 31 whose 
whole life has been devoted to a 
cause of which he can now say 
only, "The old focus, the ... 
'new politics ' that carried me 
from Fall 1957 through the first 
three months of 1970 is gone." 

Multi-Faced Pentangle 
"ldeoloey al Straitjaellet" 
But, at last, when one gets to 

the heart of the book , all he 
clawing through extraneous 
material is justified. We enter 
Potter's mind and follow his 
thoughts. Too .-flften Jhey are 
still Constrained by ideology, as 
in his repeated assertions that 
American society, not his own 
weakness, is to blame for his 
problems. In reflecting on his 
new and personal relationship 
with Leni he gives a touching, 
albeit inarticulate definition of 
love: " Here is a person I can 
trust knowledge of myself to, 
who will not use that 
knowledge to hurl me (like 
everyone else hasl does) ... [ 
ha ve trusted another person to 
keep part of myself inside her, 
which is the deepest trust 
anyone can put in anyone." 

The attempt to construct 
democratic student institutions 
has failed sinking into the same 
mire of manipulation , 
acrimony, and intimidation 
that fills history. A member of 
the vanguard party has finally 
bumped into something real 
and tangible : love. It is 
something hard to pin on 
society, it is not .something to 
be won for someone (the 
working class ) needing 
protection. It is reality, and 
when reality totally contradicts 
the ideology so deeply 
ingrained in his mind, his 
thoughts fly into confusion. By 
the end of the book (written 
several months after the rest) 
he is thinking of suicide. Such is 

Kate Rudner 

It is as difficult to describe 
the sound of the Pentangle as it 
is to describe a rainbow. One 
might speak of the individual 
hues and colors of a rainbow, 
but be unabel to convey the 
total effect, or even some of its 
qualities - its lightness, 
solidity, brilliance, delicacy -
it seems too many things at one 
time. So it is with the 
Pentangle. 

Together, the team of Terry 
Cox , Bert Jansch, Jacqui 
McShee, John Renborn and 
Danny Thompson, join to cre-
ate an indescribable sound . On 
their newest album , 
RenectioD, the Pentangle have, 
as in the past, given their 
listeners both their own and 

~CQClClQQI:IOC 

"traditional" selections. In this 
case [use "traditional" only to 
describe the origins of certain 
songs. 

"Wedding Dress" and "Omie 
Wise" are more or less 
faithful, but the back-up of the 
bass in the first , and the 
combination of Jansch 's 
incredible voice, guitar playing 
and sense of syncopation in the 
second, make both songs 
transcend their original narrow 
appeal without destroying the 
essential simpleness of the folk 
tunes they really are.

Unbroken?'· gains a 
smoothness never imparted to 
it by Joan Baez. " Rain and

outstanding cut on the album .

So wrote James Baldwin of

first play. "A Raisin in the 
Sun ," which made her, at 29, 
the youngest American, the 
first woman and the only Black 
playwright ever to win the ew

award for Best Play of the 
Year (1959 1. Five years later

"To Be Young, Gifted and

Hansberry. told in her own 
words. II begins with a gallery 
of the characters she created 
and a speech she delivered 
shortly before the opening of 
" A Raisin in the Sun.'· And 
from there it moves back and 
forth in time - from her 
earliest childhood in the 
Chicago ghetto to memories of 
her first trip south and the 
images of slavery it stirred in 
her : from school days and the 
race riot at Englewood High to 
the vear at the University of 
Wisconsin when she first 
encountered the plays of Sean 
O·Casey, the greatlrish writer 
whose work so profoundly 
influenced her own ; from the 
years of creation and triumph 
in ew York to the search for 
meaning and relevance and

world today will remain an 
inspiration to generations yet 
unborn.·' And in 1970 Julius

Keep Those Files Closed 
Students have demanded that the UCSD 

administration take an active role in dealing with 
police harassment of students. It's about time. 
Relations between UCSD students, particularly 
minority students and police are abominable. The 
San Diego Police Department has become very 
defensive in its dealings with students and the 
influence of the University administration could be 
helpful in preventing further escalation of 
hostilities between students and police. 

Students have made other demands at several 
meetings with Acting Chancellor Herbert York 
which are disturbing. Some ask that all files on 
students at UCSD be opened for. general inspection 
by a group of students. 

The files involved include those kept by the 
campus police and those maintained by the 
registrar. Some students feel that the campus 
police files should be opened so_ that a student 
committee can determine the extent of police 
surveillance of students. A noble motive, but a bad 
method. The files of the campus police should not 
be open to everyone. The TRITON TIMES believes 
that an individual should have the right to know 
what information is being kept on himself, but one 
person should not have the right to look at another 
person's files. 

The students who met with York also insisted 
that the files maintained by the Admissions Office 
and the UCSD Registrar be opened for general 
inspection. The rationale behind this suggestion is 
that the student committee will be able to 
determine who on campus are police undercover 
agents. Again a noble motive, but a completely 
unacceptable procedure. The University 
administration has an obligation to maintain the 
confidentiality of all student files. Many claim this 
obligation is meani gless because of the police and 
FB I's reported easy access to any files. If true, 
these privileges are intolerable - and the 
University must stop them. One student, or for that 
matter anyone outside the University, should not 
have the right to look at another person's files. 

When Vice-Chancellor George Murphy refused 
to allow inspection of an individual's file by other 
individuals, some students argued that peop!e 
would not object to having their files made public 
unless "they had something to hide." This is the 
same argument used by p~o~nents of ~iret~pping 
and police surveillance to lustlfy those Invasions of 
privacy. 

The TRITON TIMES condemns the use of 
undercover agents on campus, and police 
harassment. But we also deplore invasions of 
privacy on 6000 students who may not want every 
self·appointed gumshoe at UCSD looking into their 
backgrounds.

The Draft: 
American Roulette 

by Lanee Beizer 
Q. I heard this morning on the radio that I can give up my 
student deferment and get outof the draft if my lottery number 
is above 125. Is this true? 
A. If you would be in the First Priority Selection Group were 
you 10 be classified I-A before the end of the year (see the next 
question) and your random sequence (lottery) number is 126 or 
above, you can, by requesting a I·A classification in writing 
( send your correspondence by certified mail, return receipt 
requested) before January 1, 1972, be classified l·A and enter 
the Second Priority Selection Group January 1 (pretty certain 
freedom unless you enter the health professions). So long as 
you mail your letter by December 31, even if you are not 
officially classified I-A until next year. the classification will 
be retroactive 10 this year and you will enter the Second 
Priority Selection Group as you desire. 

This possibility exists, however, only for those born in 1951 or 
earlier. Before you write your letter, read the next question, 
and if you are unsure whether you qualify for the first Priority 
Selection Group rather than the Extended Priority Selection 
Group. see me. 
Q. What is the Extended Priority Selection Group and how does 
it differ from the First Priority Selection Group? 
A. Those men who lose deferments so late in the year that. 
although their random sequence numbers are low enough for 
them 10 have been drafted , they cannot be called (e .g. their 
appeal periods have not expired ) enter the Extended Priority 
Selection Group on Jauuary 1 of the following year and can be 
drafted at least through the first three months of that year. 

If you then receive a deferment while a member of the 
Extended Priority Selection Group. when you lose that 
deferment you will still be a member of the EPSG and will be 
drafted at the head of the list. It is therefore very crucial that 
you understand how that may happen 10 you. Sometimes draft 
boards do not understand how the process works and you may 
receive an improper induction notice based on the assumption 
that you are a member of the EPSG when you are not. 

Two examples should illustrate the diflerence between entry 
into the Extended Priority Selection Group and retention in the 
First Priority Selection Group. " A" was born in 1950 and his 
random sequence number is 150. He was a third year student in 
the Fall of 1970 but had not acquired the units required for 
classification as a junior. Consequently, he was classified I-A 
by his draft board at their November meeting. Over Christmas 
vacation he finished some incompletes and in January the 
school was able to certify that he was again making 
satisfactory progress. Therefore his board gave him back his 
11·S at its February meeting. When he loses his deferment "A" 
will again be a member of the Extended Priority Selection 
Group since he was a member of that group when he received 
his deferment. Unless he fails his physical examination, when 
he loses his deferment upon graduation next June he will be 
drafted. As as for this year. although his random sequence 
number is above 125, he would essentially be volunteering for 
the draft by giving up his deferment in accordance with my 
answer to the first question. 

" B" on the other hand. was also born in 1950 and also has a 
random sequence number of 150. He also failed to acquire 
enough units to be classified as a junior (his proper class) when 
the certifications were sent to draft boards in the Fall of 1970. 
He also was classified I-A by his draft board at their November 
meeting. But the difference between hi s case and " A's" is that 
he completed the required work early in December and the 
school was able to mail verification that he was making 
satisfactory progress before the end of December. 
Consequently, when he was reclassified 11-S in February 1971. 
the classification was retroactive to 1970 because the 
information upon which the classification was based was 
submitted prior to the end of 1970. Therefore " 8 " remained in 
the First Priority Selection Group, and if he now avails himself 
of the opportuniiy to request a I-A classification he will enter 
the Second Priority Selection Group in 1972. 

Therefore, if you are reclassified I-A against your wishes 
before the end of this year, see me immediately or. if you are 
out of town . call me. A few days may be the difference between 
eventually being drafted and not being drafted - especially if 
your random sequence number is 125 or slightl~ belo~. 

If you have questions about how the above dISCUSSIon affects 
your' case or if you have other questions which you would like 
answered in this column, contact me at 250 MC. ext. 1945. 

FEIFFER 
~~ 

TheKSD Iso Rises 
In the wake of what surely must be the 

most heated overdose of free publicity 
we 've ever had the good fortune to 
stumble into. we feel it might do to 
explain some rather incriminating 
things and destroy some popular 
misconceptions. 

The question burning out everybody'S 
minds these days is, "Who needs a 
station you CAN'T EVEN HEAR ??! " 
This seems to bring the issue into focus . 
Not being on the air is obviously not the 
way to serve the community, What is 
amazing is that so few in the community 
seem to have considered the possibility 
that the delay in commencement of 
broadcasting is NOT our doing. See, we 
know bad PR when we see it. Derelict 
and freaked-out we may be. but not 
stupid. Pressing our luck with student 
patience is precisely what we don 't want 
to do. 

Jim Sills asserts that "Due to 
managerial incompetency (sic ) the 
radio station is presently OFF THE AIR 
entirely until next February." (IT. 
11 /12171) This charge is, at best, foolish 
and at worst, irresponsible. The delay 
has been due entirely to a baffling 
sequence of bureaucratic impasses. 

Efforts Futile Without FM License 

Two years ago. when KSDT was 
covering the Isla Vista riots . the staff 
realized that its efforts were futile 
without an FM license to broadcast. It 
was in spring of 1970 that we laid the 
groundwork for this task which proved 

. laborious beyond our wildest 
nightmares. It was tben that we were 
allocated our Capital Outlay fund of 
$14,500, as we've mentioned (IT, 
10/22/71 ). It was then also that Mark 
Elson. Station Manager for 1969-70. was 
commissioned as FM Research 
Coordinator to collect the data and 
itemize the various requisites for FM 
license application. He spent two 
summers and the entire past academic 
year working on this . Most of this work 
proceeded without much trouble. but 
there was one snafu which has cost us at 
least a four·month delay : in order to 
legally make the application , we had to 
petition the Regents for permission.

Since the transfers indirectly involved

were lied and we couldn 't do anytbing

weeks before school started. when we 
finally received permission to move into

equipment. The first orders go out : for 
rack cabinets communications 
central for studio transmission equip-
ment. With the arrival of these cabinets 
we can wire ourselves up and Go On The 
Air! 

Purcbase Order Waylaid 

One minor problem: we find that the 
purchase order for the rack cabinets 
was mysteriously waylaid somewhere 
between us and the PurchaSing Dept. 
This we didn 't find out until just over a 
month ago. When the order finally went 
ou t. it was discovered that no one this 
side of the Alps had any in stock. It 
appears that there was a mysterious run 
on rack cabinets the week before : the 
people who bought them ran off laughing · 
into the West. 

At this point the conversion to FM has 
taken roughly two years. but now that 
we 're beginning to see daylight the 
hassles don 't seem to matter much at 
all. Because . and this is the best part : 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY! The rack 
cabinets have arrived and the studios 
are being wired this week. We are 
scheduling ourselves to begin carrier 
current transmission to the dorms next 
week and will begin FM as soon as the 
Construction Permit comes. (Cross your 
fingers. say nine Hail Marys, turn off 
the light and whisper, " late January or 
early February?" But make sure no 
one's listening.) UCSD will have its 
radio station. The next few weeks will 
see us expla ining in depth (on the air and 
in the IT) and previewing the things we 
plan to do-and, frankly. they're all 
exciting. We have a chance to fight back 
against the Tin Voice that imbedded 
itself in our ears in the years of the 
Transistor Revolution. We will settle for 
nothing less than being the best radio 
station in the universe as we know it. 

Now if we can only get a reasonable 
estimate from Reynolds Wrap.... .-

Whith Dog is Barking 
by S.heila Roberts 

The Third College has been set upon by a pack of dogs. 
Barking. yelping. gnawing at the very fiber~ of the colleg.e 
structural life. Viciously attemptmg to devo.ur It ; to consume,.t 
in its initial stages of development. Collier 'S EncyclopedIa 
says a dog is " An animal which in its domesticated form has 
been for thousands years more closely associate~ with man, ~s 
servant and compa~ion . than any other am mal. In ~ebste~, s 
dictionary a dog IS "a low contempllble fellow or a 
mechanical device for holding or grappling." 

Some of these dogs are trained in "highly respectable" 
schools within the United States and out of the country. 
Likewise, these so-called respectable dogs have responded as 
they have been trained to respond - to become a loyal dog. The 
tricks they have learned are to be used upon Third College. 

In the TRITON TIMES volume 11 number \, Assemblyman 
John Stull said "Third College is a racist and sandbox affair." 
This man John Stull a representative of the people, makes 
this state~ent but searches no further for the importance of 
Third College. He does not see the college in the eyes of a 
human. however. but in the eyes of a dog, who only seeks to 
attack. Following the scent left by other ~ogs. he seeks a 
comfortable environment until met by the entire pack. 

The academic standards and curriculum of Third gives the 
students a broader view of the world situation helping him /her 
to adapt and alter any flaws in the government. Third Colle~e 
has more minority students enrolled than MUIr or Reyelle . thIS 
is where the separation and controversy tOPIC begins of the 
existence of Third College. The dogs are not only on UCSD 
campus, but everywhere, in the streets and in the home. 
leaving their tracks and waste all over. . 

The dog has the connotation o[ being "Man's best .fnend." 
al though he is known to betr~y man he ~tllI carnes th~s 
connotation. The students of ThIrd must reahze that a certam 
group of dogs will infiltrate the college to gam all the power for 
their master. Dogs are usually called Rover, Spot. Duke, etc., 
however, due to modern trend. dogs have names such as JIm, 
Jack. Karl. George and other Christian names. 

The dog is barking louder and l.ouder anll a muzzle has to be 
put on in order that he may not dIsturb others. It. IS our duty as 
a minority group <Third College students) to seIze .thes.e dogs 
as they have done our people who speak out. Symbolism IS used 
in this article to make a direct point of characterizatIOn 10 
certain groups. A poodle is a dog who is curly. cuddling, and 
weak. He is generally well-trained and has attend~ a 
respectable obedient school. The dog has an ostentatIous 
behavior causing it to be the center of attention. One dIlemma 
the poodle has is nervousness which causes it to e~acuate when 
trouble arises. Check out your peers, teachers, fnends and ask 
"WHY"? 

Another dog is the German shepherd. mean. big. and 
powerful. The German shepherd is taught to attack. These 
dogs are so useful that the police uses ·them to do jobs. They 
can destroy and corrupt people physically and mentally. The 
master of the German shepherd gives commands and the dog IS 
to follow. If the dog should think for himself he will soon be 
terminated from all his responsibilities . Do you see anvone? . 
There arealso 'sheep dogs. shaggy. big, and strong. Their maIO 
task is to lead and protect sheep. Sheep need a dog because 
they cannot provide for themselves. Third College students are 
NOT sheep. . 

To me Third College is an immunization against the bite that 
the dog ' may give, to protect Third College students from 
rabies. 

Letters to the Editor 
Misquoted Koran 
Editor : 

I would like to note the 
condescending remark 
prefaced to your recently 
published interview with 
Pharaoh Sanders. Th is remark 
was : "There were many other 
things he said, however . (sic) I 

. feel these things should stay 
within the family - the Black 
community family." 

I think that. despite this 
condescending slap in the face, 
we should all be happy that the 
interview was as short as it 
was. After Mr. Sanders refers 
to the Koran as the .. Holy 
Scriptures," one would like to 
ask him how he gets the idea of 
naming himself " Pharaoh" 
(which is a godless name) 
rather than Abderrahman or an 
equivalent name implying the 
correct Islamic view of man 's 
relationship to God . The 
pharaohs claimed to be gods. 
not to worship him. 

He also seems to misquote 
his Koran. "Summon Bukmun 
'Umyun ' .. may, however. be 
due to the typo dept. of the IT. 

His other comments on 
music, vegetarianism. and 
third college ("didn't Angela 
Davis have something to do 
with it?") are insane. As the 
Pharaoh himself puts it, " A lot 
of people are very much 
unaware of what is going on 
around them. all they do is just 
living without never knowing 
nothing. " 

Thanks again to those 
responsible for keeping more of 
this nonsense out of the paper. 
He may play well , but his 
words were not worth print.

Dear Mr. Kristofferson : 
When and where is this party

Cheap and Tacky 
Editor : 

Re the article written by Jim 
Sills in your Nov. 16 issue 
entitled "The Price of Silence:' 
but more particularly. re the 
photograph which (I am 
assuming ) accompanies said 
article-I am disgusted and 
appalled. Can it be that Mr. 
Sills believes such a picture to 
be an integral part of his 
professed attempt to " calmly 
and succintly" explore the 
" issue " of the moral 
acceptability of clinical 
abortion? I personally found 
the photograph to be an 
obnoxious hindrance to a calm. 
unprejudiced study of either of 
the two articles on the same 
page which dealt which various 
aspects of and approaches to 
abortion as an alternative. 

Jim 's article itself was fairly 
and diplomatically written. I 
have no objection to the 
material , and. in fact I admire 
the complete (though gre2t! 
condensed ) manner in which 
Mr . Sills presented his 
discussion. His opinion leaves 
me wondering why he dislikes 
women - nevertheless, he is 
entitled to his opinion and I 
respect that fact. 

That photograph, however. 
rerJects to me the sort of 
bloody , shock-value·only 
material which makes even a 
moderatel y readable . 
generally acceptable 
newspaper like the TRITON 
TIMES look cheap and tacky. 

Sincerely, 
Anna Niemann

Grapplers Fight On 
Mark Li5ka 

What are the strange sounds (moans. groans, screams of 
agony I tha t are beginning to resound through the hallowed 
hall of lhe UCSD gym? Obviously, some sort of physical 
exertion. or pain, or bolh (o r something obscene ). Well 
actually, it is none and all of these. because verily il is the one 
and only. all-American. UCSD wrestling team practicing their

This year wrestling will be one of lhe biggesl and mosl 
successful underground sports (arent't all sports at UCSD

combination of traits. backed by a plethora of returning 
lettermen and bolstered by a fine flock of finagling freshmen. 
Because of these significant symploms. UCSD grapplers will 
be looking forward to a good season. 

La t year . the team enjoyed a fine record of 8-2, including a 
handful of tournament crowns. The team was led bv hard-cores 
Tom Saichek. Javier Correa, Mike Ditomaso. and John Knapp. 
and they are all gracing the team with their return. Javier and 
Mike were each Most Valuable in their respective weight 
classes last rear. and also accrued other litles. such as first in 
the Cal Tech tourney. (Mike I and second in Di trict (Javier J.

Soaring Club Sails On

Believe it or not there is a UCSD Soaring club. 
The object of the club is to train new pilots at a 
low cost. As of this year, the soaring club has 
trained ten people to pilot status. and have 
several more students aboulto solo. 

This year, though, the Soaring Club has run into 
problems. They are just about broke. Last year 
the University required the club to have one 
million dollars in liability insurance. The cost of 
this insurance is over $1.200. which is more than 
the income the club receives from dues. The 
soaring club believes that this insurance is 
unreasonable. There is no training operation in

the nation that carries this much insurance, and 
they could not possibly do this much damage. 

As of last week. the Soaring club started new 
ta lks with lhe Regents concerning the insurance. 
Right now it looks as though there is a chance 
that the requirements for the insurance will be 
lowered. IT the requirements are lowered. the 
Soaring club will conduct a three weak training 
operation over Christmas vacation at Lake 
Elsinore.

The UCSD Water Polo team 

wrapped up its regular season 
play Wednesday against 
Occidental at the opponents 
pool. Unfortunately. with 
Christmas 10 close. the team 
seemed more preoccupied with 
wrapping than winninll. The 
game was permeated by no 
single theme. but might best be 
encapsulated by the phrases. 
" throwing without thinking" 
and " strategy witbout spirit." 

When the Tritons lined up on

By this time. the bonest

The Tritons had amassed 20

earlier home games. Dave 
Turnakitquist set the pa~e (and 
a school record) by gathering 
his fifth foul and thereby

pace. they would have fouled

Holliman at HEW made it clear that if even one 
department of the University did. not have an 
acceptable proj!ram. there would be a public 
hearing to determine why. If no good reason 
was found . HEW would recommend that all 
future federal grants to the univerSity be

40 per cent of the budget. accordmg to Don Weir

Watson and Tnird College •••• 
Continued from page 3 

to inc rea se opportu nities for 
minorities in general and for people in 
general , but in particular to try and 
meet the special needs of Blacks and 
Chicanos in the College. 

"Towards that end, the initial board, 
essentially just consisted of, as far as 
student representation was concerned, 
a board of two members and a faculty 
member, and that this was supposed to 
be a Black and Chicano college, not in 
the sense that only their needs were to 
be considered, but that the main 
thrust, that had to be made, was made 
from that perspective. And, in fact, the 
original Lumumba-Zapala demands 
themselves even state that this will be 
in the college, those students other 
than Blacks and Chicanos. " 

T.T.: " Many people, including 
myself , are upset over the nationalistic 
tendencies among people and we feel 
this is interfering with the appropriate 
function of the College. Could you 
comment on this?" 

J .W.: " I don 't know what the 
appropriate function of the college is 
regarding the Lumumba·Zapata 
demands in this context, but I think as 
far as the board decisions are 
concerned , I would say that this is not 
the case . We certainly have our 

problems with diverse nationalistic 
opinions and attitudes, but I think as 
far as the board 's actions have been 
concerned, there have been two 
primary guiding factors: one, the 
sound academic program and thus a 
sound college, and two, that one meets 
the most pressing needs. 

One is probably open to the criticism 
that the most pressing needs have been 
seen as those of Blacks and Chicanos, 
and I don 't know how definite that it is. 
I think that one of the things that has 
been guiding us, and I think that may 
be considered or interpreted as being a 
nationalistic tendency. I would say that 
they present the most pressing needs 
of the College. as it is roughtly 70 per 
cent Black and Chicano." 

T.T.: "Could you comment upon the 
hostility the whi te community has 
shown towards Third College?" 

J .W.: " It has been minimal , since 
the original opening days of the 
College, and in facl , we've seen very 
little white hostility. Some people feel 
that anything minority is either low in 
quality or militant and radical in form, 
but I think those are a small number of 
people, and when we 've explained to 
them our program, and the objectives 
of the college to whites and other 
people, they are often supportive."
