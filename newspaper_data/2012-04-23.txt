For one 24-hour period, Sixth College finally had a name. The aptly named “Conan O’Brien College” welcomed the TV star to UCSD in celebra-tion of Sixth College’s tenth anniversary. The event, which hit maximum capacity of nearly 5,000 people,  was held at RIMAC Arena on April 20. 
       According to Sixth College Dean of Student Affairs Marciano Perez, tickets for 
the event sold out around 3:20 p.m. on Friday before the show. Event organizers 
originally intended for the event to be for students only; however, organizers made 
tickets available to guests on Thursday after ensuring the maximum participation of 
Sixth College students and alumni.

Sixth College provost Dan Donoghue introduced O’Brien by calling him “the 
embodiment of Sixth College ideals” and announced that the college will be known 
as “Conan O’Brien College” every year on April 20. 

The red-haired comedian ran onto the stage shortly after Donoghue’s introduc-
tion.

“What the hell do you mean it will only be called Conan O’Brien College for one 
day?” O’Brien joked. “I was under the impression this would be a permanent name 
change. Tomorrow it’s the Zac Efron Library.”

O’Brien greeted students from all six colleges before introducing himself. He said

KUMEYAAY REMAINSSTUDENT LIFEUC SYSTEM

Record 
Number 
Admitted 
in 2012
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

According to the most recent 
admissions data, 2012 marks the 
first time in several years that UCSD 
is not the third most selective UC 
campus.

According to data released last 
week, UCSD, which ranked third 
in the UC system in the number 
of applications received, admitted 
22,939 students, or 37.7 percent of 
the 60,000+ applications for Fall 
2012. UCSD had the fourth most 
selective admission rate, after UC 
Berkeley, UCLA and UC Irvine.

UC Irvine overshot UCSD in 
selectivity for applications from the 
class of 2016. According to an April 
17 statement on the UCI website, 
the university chose to adhere to a 
strict admissions guideline which 
may have led to its increased selec-
tivity. UC Irvine’s average GPA for 
admitted students matched that of 
UCSD.

“Fewer incoming freshmen were 
admitted [to UC Irvine] for Fall 
2012 than for Fall 2011 — by design, 
as the campus aligns its student 
population with state funding tar-
gets,” the statement read.

The average GPA of students 
admitted to UCSD was  4.07, a drop 
from the 4.09 GPA for students 
admitted for Fall 2011. The average 
SAT I score was 1991 total and 1330 
for math and reading combined.

A record number of applicants 
were accepted to at least one UC 
campus for the academic year 
beginning Fall 2012. 

Of the 126,000 applicants to UC 
schools, nearly 64 percent, or 80,000 
students, received at least one offer 
of admission. Last year, 72,432 were 
accepted.

 “We have the capacity to edu-
cate many more students at our 
campuses,” UC interim Director of 
Undergraduate Admissions Kate 
Jeffery said in a April 17 press 
release. 

The class of 2016 was the first 
class exempt from taking SAT II 
subject tests — the result of a 2009 
policy change. 

According to a statement on the 
UC Office of the President web-
site, this policy change was enacted 
to create a more holistic process 
for determining admissions and to 
increase diversity.

UCSD 
Sued Over 
Human 
Remains
BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

Native American tribes are 
suing the University of California 
over human remains found at the 
University House in 1976. The 
Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation 
Committee filed the complaint on 
April 13 with the United States 
District Court. The lawsuit says 
that the University of California 
has refused to repatriate, or return, 
the 9,000-year-old remains to the 
Kumeyaay tribe, on whose land the 
bones were found. 

According to the Courthouse 
News Service, UCSD prepared to 
give back the human remains in 
January 2012, following the guide-
lines of a National Park Service 
regulation. The return was blocked 
by three University of California 
professors who had prepared to file 
a temporary restraining order. 

UCSD spokesperson Jeff Gattas 
told the Courthouse News Service 
that, as of April 17, the university 
had not seen the lawsuit and had 
followed the proper UC procedures 
to work with Kumeyaay remains.

The delay has been partly due 
to the ambiguity over whether the 
remains are, specifically, Kumeyaay 
remains. In 2008, a group of UCSD 
scholars was assigned to determine 
whether the bones could be affili-
ated with a tribe. Under the Native 
American Graves and Protection 
and Repatriation Act of 1990, if the 
remains are culturally affiliated with 
the Kumeyaay organization, they 
must be returned. 

The working group —  which 
consisted of two anthropologists, an 
ethnic studies professor and a pro-
fessor from the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography —  determined 
that the skeletal remains were “cul-
turally unidentifiable.” The 2008 
report said that the remains, at 
approximately 9,000 years old, pre-
date the existence of the Kumeyaay 
in the San Diego region.

Then, on May 14, 2010 the 
National Park Service finalized 
a regulation on how “culturally 
unidentifiable” Native American 
human remains should be treated. 
The new guideline states that these 
remains should be repatriated to 
the tribe whose original lands they 
were removed from (in this case, the 
Kumeyaay). 

Under these provisions, the 
University of California had pre-

pared to return the remains to the 
KCRC around Jan. 5, 2012. But 
proceedings stopped a day before 
due to the restraining order. UCSD 
agreed to delay the return until 
UCSD could review the professors’ 
claims. 

The new lawsuit names the 
defendants as the University of 
California; the Board of Regents 
of the University; UC President, 
Mark G. Yudof; UCSD Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox and UCSD Vice 
Chancellor for Resource and 
Planning Gary Matthews.

“The human remains are Native 
American and the land from which 
they were removed is the aboriginal 

lands of the Kumeyaay,” the KCRC 
said in the document. “Under the 
Native American Graves Protection 
Act (NAGPRA) and its implement-
ing regulations, the defendants are 
required to repatriate the human 
remains in its possession to KCRC.”

Court documents state that the 
remains have been studied exten-
sively since their discovery.

“KCRC has over the years criti-
cized the treatment and disrespect-
ful handling and study of the Native 
American remains, especially the 
lacquering of the remains to pre-
serve them,” the document states.

UCLA professor Gail Kennedy 
led the original excavation in the 
La Jolla cliffs below the University 
House. At the time, the area was 

known for being rich in Native 
American burials and artifacts and 
has since been designated as a sanc-
tified cemetery by California state 
law.

Since the discovery, the remains 
have been studied and stored at 
numerous locations throughout 
the country, including UCLA, the 
National Museum of History and 
the Smithsonian Institution. The 
remains are currently being stored 
at the San Diego Archaeological 
Center in agreement with UCSD.

The KCRC is represented by 
Dorothy Alther with the California 
Indian Legal Service of Escondido.

April 17 showed an increase in 
minority admissions across the 
board. In addition, every campus 
except UC Berkeley accepted more 
out-of-state and international stu-
dents than in 2011. At UCSD, non-
California residents accounted for 
32.7 percent of admitted students.

According to an April 17 UCSD 
press release, 52 percent of admitted 
students are female. 

Admission rates for Native 
Americans jumped to 119 from 77 
last year, and figures for African 
American and Hispanic students 
also rose compared to 2010 data.

ing about topics ranging from media in 
the twenty-first century, to his life and 
“the women I’ve been with.”

The rest of the evening ran as a 
question-and-answer session, rotating 
between questions from students lined 
up at a centrally located microphone, 
and student-submitted questions from 
a box passed around before the show.

O’Brien answered questions about 
the most attractive person he has 
interviewed (Angelina Jolie), his crazi-
est college experience (he broke into 
the Harvard Crimson office with the 
Lampoon magazine staff to steal the 
campus newspapers before they could 
be distributed the next day), what he 
would be if he wasn’t a television host 
(a writer or an exotic dancer) and his 
biggest fear and insecurities.

“You continue to have your prob-

lems and continue to be insecure,” 
O’Brien said. “Every day I go out and 
do my show is a struggle... I’m abso-
lutely terrified of not making an audi-
ence happy.”

O’Brien let an audience member 
touch his famous hair and gave dating 
advice to a student — just be honest 
with her. 

He also answered questions about 
people in show business, outlining 
his “70/20/10” rule — “70 percent 
of people in show business are really 
nice, 20 percent are OK and 10 percent 
are ‘life is too short’” — and referred 
to “Saturday Night Live” veteran Will 
Ferrell as one of his favorite people to 
interview. 

“There’s nothing I like more than 
talking to young people who are smart 
and funny,” O’Brien said as the evening 
came to an end.

ILLUSTRATION BY KAYLA BATOM/GUARDIAN

It doesn’t take more than a quick glance into an upper division solid mechanics class to realize that female engineering students are 
few and far between. Women constitute only 20 
percent of all engineering majors and hold only 
9 percent of engineering jobs, according to a 
National Science Foundation study conducted in 
2008. This substantial gender gap in engineering 
is unlike that of any other male dominated field 
and has not shown signs of improvement in the 
past decade. Gender stereotypes and unequal 
treatment are just a few struggles that remain for 
women in engineering, and novel approaches will 
have to be taken in order to change the status quo.

A common perception in society, backed up by 
national studies, shows that women are perceived 
as less capable to succeed in engineering as males 
and in general less adept in the physical sciences 
and mathematics. Furthermore, female engineers 
are associated with being shy, soft-spoken and 
overly emotional. As a female bioengineering 
student, I can say that I have faced a lot of 
skepticism for straying from these stereotypes, yet 
this doesn’t make me any less qualified to be an 
engineer or prevent me from scoring higher in 

engineering classes than most males. 
Numerous studies focusing on the social 

aspects of women in engineering have been 
conducted here at the UCSD Jacobs School 
of Engineering, and they reveal a lot more 
than numbers alone. One study, Gender and 
Achievement-Related Beliefs among Engineering 
Students, which was published in the 2002 
Journal of Women and Minorities in Science 
and Engineering, indicates that 55 percent of 
female engineers at UCSD feel that they are 
treated unequally. The study also quotes some 
students who note that “[male students] tend 
to be condescending; others treat you like you 
don’t know anything” and “sometimes we are 
not believed, looked down upon, seen as ‘little 
girls.’” It has become a cultural norm to assume 
that females are less likely to succeed in technical 
fields and this hostile environment has become so 
ubiquitous that steps need to be taken to equalize 
the field for men and women.

Additionally, researchers across the nation 
have conducted studies to explain the meager 
levels of females in engineering in hopes of 
finding ways to bridge the gap. Most recently, 

mathematics professor Jonathan Kane of the 
University of Wisconsin–Whitewater and 
oncology professor Janet Mertz of the University 
of Wisconsin–Madison conducted an ambitious 
study that aimed to quantify the variance in 
math performance amongst males and females 
in 52 different countries. The results of this 
large-scale study reveal that there is no difference 
in distribution based on gender, putting to rest 
previous theories which claim that math skills are 
biologically innate to men. 

There have been several motions to increase 
the number of females in engineering, including 
companies placing quotas on the number of 
women in leadership positions and increased 
funding for female-based engineering programs. 
Although these motions are leading us in the 
right direction, they aren’t targeting the problem 
effectively. The root of the problem is the 
lack of exposure of females, at a young age, to 
engineering. According to a Girl Scout Research 
Institute Study conducted earlier this year, 60 
percent of teenage girls state that they know more 

While it is still illegal for employers to 
bully workers into skipping lunch, employers 
no longer face the ridiculous task of policing 
an employee’s lunch habits. Clarifying this 
subtlety will bring tremendous security to both 
employers and employees.

Up until now, employers have had to guess 
what their exact legal obligation is regarding 
employee rest breaks, San Diego attorney 
Julie Dunne said. Calchamber.com lists “meal 
breaks” as one of the top 10 reasons employers 
get sued. Dunne says restaurants especially get 
sued often, spending millions on legal battles 
and settlements, leaving them less money to 
hire and expand. Thankfully, she feels the 
court’s decision should cause a significant 
reduction in lawsuits.

The ambiguity of meal break rules 
inconvenienced employees as well. Employers 
started policing lunch laws in an overbearing 
way, to ensure compliance with unclear 
California rules. A January 24 CBS web article 
explained that HR often makes precautionary 
demands that are seemingly irrational, such as 
forcing workers to go to the lunch room, or go 
home right at 5 p.m. A receptionist at Equity 
Lifestyle Properties was even fired last January 
after she insisted on working through lunch to 
finish her project. Now, this newfound clarity 
will allow workers to weigh their options and 
choose to work when they have the greatest 
potential for commissions or tips. 

This ruling strikes a good balance, ensuring 
employees are guaranteed meal breaks, while 
still giving them the flexibility to work when 
they feel it is most beneficial.

QUICK TAKES ON  APRIL 12,  THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY RULED IN BRINKER RESTAURANT CORP. ET AL V. THE SUPERIOR COURT THAT EMPLOYERS DO NOT NEED TO REGULATE STATE-MANDATED LUNCH BREAKS.

Employers must give employees thirty-minute 
lunch breaks, as stipulated by Title 8 of the 
California Code of Regulations, but they are now 
not obligated to make these employees take it. This 
means that if they choose to, employees may work 
through their breaks without being cited for truant 
behavior. Though well-intended, the decision is a 
step in the wrong direction because it chips away at 
the protection California workers used to have that 
prevented them from being bullied by employers 
for working through their breaks. 

The decision contradicts the terms of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, a piece of 
federal legislation stipulating that workers are 
not allowed to work for free, even if they want to. 
This act was put into place to ensure that workers 
couldn’t easily be bullied or pressured into working 
through unpaid lunch breaks, which amounts to 
free labor. It was, and remains to this day, a serious 
concern for low-income workers. 

Getting too much of a break is a less serious 
concern. The overly cited case of Sharon Smiley, 
who was fired from Equity Lifestyle Properties this 
January for not leaving her desk during her lunch 
break, is the freak case of an overly active human 
resources team. Far more common is the case of 
the worker who was pressured into foregoing his 
or her lunch break: the Golden State Restaurant 
Association reports that there have been 131 claims 
for wages unpaid during skipped meal breaks in 
the state of California in the last two years alone.

Far fewer employees are pressured into 
taking their lunch breaks, than are pressured into 
skipping them. The California Supreme Court is 
misrepresenting reality when it presents its recent 
ruling as a win for workers’ freedom.

— AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

The California Supreme Court ruled 
unanimously on a case filed nine years ago 
that employers are not obligated to force 
employees to take legally-mandated lunch 
breaks. This decision allows for employees to 
be treated as competent individuals and allows 
for employers to not usher their workers into 
meal breaks like babysitters.

Those who have worked in retail or the 
food service industry in California know how 
seriously managers take breaks. This is because 
California is one of the few states that punishes 
employers monetarily if employees miss their 
meal periods; for example, if an employee 
works for more than a five-hour block without 
a lunch break, they get paid an extra hour 
automatically. 

This California law and many other federal 
ones regarding employment are posted on 
federal green sheet along with EOC policy. 
This allows for employees to be proactive 
about their rights.

The ruling was applauded by Roger 
Thompson, executive vice president and 
general counsel of Brinker, because it now 
allows employees the flexibility of when they 
can take their breaks. If employees so desired, 
they can postpone their breaks and help 
through the rush rather than letting their team 
members be overloaded. This ruling also gives 
restaurant employers in California a greater 
understanding of what is expected of them in 
regards to giving their employees breaks. 

The bottom line is that employees should 
know their rights and should stand up them if 
it so comes down to it.

Workers Should Know Their Rights Court Decision Brings Legal Clarity  Ruling Contradicts Fair Labor Act

Social stigmas have contributed to low numbers of  females in the engineering field, but solutions 
have been proven to alleviate this problem, including introducing girls to engineering at a young age.

By Revathy Sampath-KumaR • Staff wRiteR

Arizona lawmakers, in an effort to promote their pro-right agenda, have created a 
provision to their new anti-abortion 
bill that would make any parent’s heart 
stop in their throat. Pregnancy is now 

calculated from the first day of the 
woman’s last menstrual period — two 
weeks before actual conception. Yes, 
you read that correctly. In Arizona, 
you can be technically pregnant before 
ever engaging in sexual intercourse. 

But to understand the poorly 
conceived logic behind this provision, 
background information is needed. 
On April 10, Arizona’s Republican-
dominated House of Representatives 
passed three anti-abortion bills that 
are now waiting for Republican Gov. 
Jan Brewer’s likely signature. The first 
bill, which the controversy surrounds, 
attempts to prohibit abortions after 
the 18th week of pregnancy, that is, to 
establish fetal viability at 18 weeks.

Viability is a strange concept, but 
thankfully, my legal textbook from 
this quarter will come in handy — so 
will my class’s three-hour lectures on 
abortion, contraception and sodomy. 
In 1972, the landmark case Roe v. 
Wade established a woman’s right to 
abort her pregnancy under the three 
trimester rule — during her first three 
months of pregnancy, she could have 
an abortion with no input from the 
state; the next three months would 
require a doctor’s consent; the final 
three months would require her to 
carry out her pregnancy to term. 

In 1993 in Planned Parenthood 
v. Casey, the trimester system was 
scrapped for something called 
“viability,” that is, the point during 
the pregnancy when the fetus would 
be able to live outside of the mother’s 
womb (with medical help). The time 
period established was 28 weeks, or 
7 months (right in the middle of the 
second trimester) but it could go as 
early as 22 weeks. Currently, most 
states, including California, use 20 
weeks as the cutoff date. 

Of course, as stated earlier, 
Arizona’s new law states viability at 18 
weeks. In order to finagle its status as 
the state that hates abortion the very 
most, Arizona lawmakers had to be a 
little liberal (gasp) with the wording 
of the word “conception.” Hence, the 
definition of pregnancy at two weeks 
before actual conception. 

But we should be fair to the 
Arizona House of Representatives. 
Even though this bill is clearly an 
obvious ploy to damage the abortion 
rights given to women by Roe v. 
Wade, apparently, this new definition 
of pregnancy is actually already used 
by medical professionals. Because the 
exact date of conception is hard to 
pinpoint, doctors end up using the 
day of the woman’s last menstrual 
period as the day of conception. 

Definitions aside, this does not 
change the fact that the medical 
definition of gestation is a convenient 
excuse for Republican lawmakers to 
push their anti-abortion agenda. If 
this law passes, it will join SB1070 in 
the ranks of Arizona’s insane ultra-
conservatism.

about other careers than careers in engineering. If we want 
to get girls interested in the field, it is necessary to give 
them hands-on activities that will get them interested.

Students at various college campuses are trying to make 
a difference by creating outreach events for local middle 
and high school students. Here at UCSD, the Society of 
Women Engineers hosts an annual event for local San 
Diego high school girls called Envision, in which girls tour 
engineering labs, build robots and interact with female 
engineering undergraduates. Polls taken after the event 
reveal that 71 percent of girls feel that they learned a lot 
more about engineering, but enrollment of females in the 
Jacobs School of Engineering remains close to national 
averages at 19 percent. In order to have a significant 
impact, events like this need to be more widespread and 
reach out to more students.

Along with showing females that they do have a place 
in engineering, it is crucial that those in high positions 

show their support. UCSD has taken strides in this effort 
with the creation of the Inclusion, Diversity, Excellence and 
Advancement Student Center in 2011 within the school of 
engineering that works to retain and empower minority 
students in engineering by hosting outreach events, 
mentoring programs, internship advising and scholarships. 
Personally, working with the IDEA center as well as 
serving as outreach officer and current president of SWE is 
a big reason why I am proud to be a female engineer.

Ultimately, the gender gap in engineering has little to 
do with ability and more to do with lack of exposure and 
social stigmas. Movements to bridge the gap including 
educating females about engineering at a young age, 
promoting retention at the undergraduate level and quotas 
to equalize the workplace are currently under way and 
their results are highly anticipated.

Dear Editor, 
On Monday night, after I 

wrote my initial letter, AA4Autism

a space for discussion of autism 
and related issues. The discussion 
is going very well.

Dear Editor, 
Frankly, I’m appalled the 

Guardian’s editorial board accepted 
(and presumably assigned) the 
recent article on UC education 
being leftist —and on the front 
page no less! I hope that in the 
future the Guardian will practice 
what the California Association 
of Scholars apparently preaches, 
namely, critical thinking and will 
look into the biases of the sources 
its cites. Otherwise, I fear that the 
paper will soon be citing Fox News 
as a reputable source. The fact is, 
CAS (and its parent group NAS) 
are conservative organizations 
that hide under the same “fair 
and balanced” mask; their 

funding largely comes from other 
conservative political groups.

 It is therefore no surprise that 
CAS comes out against the UC 
System. Historically, our schools 
have been on the forefront of 
progressive movements that have 
helped women, racial minorities 
and other disempowered 
groups improve their lives both 
within academia and without. 
Many of the undergraduates 
here, including the author of the 
article, are the beneficiaries of our 
historic “leftism.” Ironically, today’s 
UCs are far less leftist than they 
may have been decades ago, and 
the use of statistics by the CAS 
regarding political membership 
is telling. Since when does being 
a Democrat, a party now known 
for its extreme centrism, represent 
a threat to anyone except the far 
right?

For what it’s worth, I am proud 
to be an actual leftist at UCSD.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

You may have seen them already — sleek spiral notebooks, with black and baby blue cov-ers, monogrammed 
with the mysterious four-letter word 
“BODO.” 

In just two days at the beginning 
of the quarter, the Buy One, Donate 
One project at UCSD sold 150 of 
its BODO-emblazoned notebooks at 
four dollars apiece.  

“It was incredible,” recent UCSD 
graduate and one of the project’s chief 
architects, Snehal Desai, said about 
the student response. “We only have 
a hundred left.” 

The proceeds from each note-
book sale will go toward buying a 
second notebook for an impover-
ished student in another country. 
Desai said she and her co-founders, 
Yousaf Husain and Nilay Shah, were 
inspired by their trip to the 2011 
Clinton Global Initiative University 
Conference (CGI-U), a colloquium 
of American college students inter-

ested in starting philanthropic proj-
ects around the world. Students with 
particularly impressive ideas won 
funding for their projects at CGI-U 
2011. 

For the few college students across 
the nation that are accepted, CGI-U 
is as much a networking opportunity 
as it is a chance to receive sponsor-
ship, training and support for their 
ideas. Founded in 2005, CGI is a 
philanthropic powerhouse: It has 
made over 2,100 “commitments” — 
what the organization calls the char-
ity projects that have already received 
their funding. Of these, those already 
in action are estimated by the Clinton 
Foundation to be “improving the 
lives of nearly 400 million people in 
more than 180 countries.” 

In order to attend the CGI-U 
meeting, all applicants have to pro-
pose an idea for their commitment, 
and they must agree to commit to 
their idea by the end of the confer-
ence if they hope to secure funding. 
As high pressure as the CGI-U meet-

ings can be, it makes the process of 
securing money much simpler for 
young philanthropists. Luckily for 
Desai and the BODO team, CGI-U 
helped them develop their project 
and secure funding. 

“We wanted to come up with a 
sustainable project related to edu-
cation — something that would 
last,” Desai said. “We realized that 
at UCSD, because we’re on a quar-
ter system, a lot of notebooks go to 
waste.” 

Originally, the group’s idea had 
been to recycle spiral notebooks more 
efficiently by finding a way to use the 
remaining pages in the notebooks.

“We wanted to do a notebook 
drive, to reclaim old notebooks,” 
Desai said. “But we quickly realized 
that doing that on a large scale wasn’t 
feasible.” 

What they did find to be feasible, 
however, was the BODO project, 
which they pitched at CGI-U. 

BODO
Notebooks 
With a Heart

By Ayan Kusari • Staff  Writer

The Buy One Donate One project, funded by the Clinton 
Global Initiative University, is helping to promote education 

for impoverished children around the world 
one notebook at a time.

See NOTEBOOK, page 7



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, APRIL 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 7

Desai, Husain and Shah won 
$1040 from sponsors at the confer-
ence. They have not required any 
additional funding for their initial 
offering of notebooks. 

The BODO project’s primary 
aim is to help fund the education of 
impoverished children abroad. But 
its founders believe their project will 
also help make it hip to be sus-
tainable here at UCSD. They believe 
there is more to their notebooks than 
the philanthropic story behind them. 
Sturdy, glossy and with a quirky 
design (the logos are made to look 
like they are cut-out pages of lined 
paper), the notebooks are appealing 
products in their own right.

The logos were designed by 
Angela Kim, a former UCSD student 
who was working through the A.S. 
Graphics Studio. 

Desai says cheap spiral notebooks 
are a tempting but unsuitable option 
for an action group like BODO, since 
child labor in impoverished coun-
tries frequently goes into making the 
paper. 

“If we used our profits to buy 

cheap notebooks, we could theoreti-
cally serve thousands of children,” 
she said. “But that would be such 
hypocrisy on our part.” 

Even if it means fewer spiral note-
books, the BODO team is unwilling 
to forsake its conscience. 

“We don’t want to be shady,” Desai 
said.

For the first batch of note-
books, BODO worked with the 
Pennsylvania-based Roaring Spring 
Paper Products. The company spe-
cializes in sustainable, green, ethical 
paper production. The cost of ship-
ping the initial order was substantial, 
however. “We’re trying to find anoth-
er green company that’s closer to us. 
We’re having trouble because most 
notebook companies aren’t environ-
mentally friendly, and many use child 
labor.”  

The team’s refusal to use cheap 
notebooks illustrates an idealism 
that underpins BODO — a project 
grounded in the idea that children 
everywhere should be able to read, 
write and learn.

I t’s the eerie noises you’ll notice first upon walking into the University Art Gallery — one of the elements 
of its current exhibit, ANOMALIA. 
The sound is actually the audio com-
ponent of the 4D artwork of Mexican 
artist Erick Meyenberg, who uses 
LED lights and sound to reinterpret 
and represent the genetic coding of 
Mexicans, from the colonial period to 
today. The alien noises are a composi-
tion of the music of three dominant 
ethnic groups in Mexico, and they 
correspond to the changing red, blue 
and green lights.

Meyenberg and the other two art-
ists whose works are being presented 
at the UAG all draw inspiration from 
science, producing unique works of 
art based on their own aesthetic as 
well as the collection and organiza-
tion of scientific data. 

“The theme here is the intersec-
tion between science and art,” UAG 
Exhibitions Manager Merete Kjaer 
said. “We have artists looking towards 
science and methodical ways of ana-

lyzing data, and thereby creating an 
aesthetic.”

The collection, which was 
brought together specifically for 
UCSD by independent curator Lucía 
Sanromán, features two bodies of 
work by conceptual artist Charles 
Gaines in the 1980s, both of which 
break down images of trees into grids 
of numbers and colors.

“He reduces this actual image of 
a tree into a display of data, a grid of 
colors, and associates different num-
bers and shades on the grid with 
different colors in the image,” Kjaer 
said. “That’s where the aesthetic com-
ponent comes in.”

Perhaps the most perplexing 
installations in the gallery are the 
works of Erick Beltrán and Jorge 
Satorre. The two young Mexican art-
ists compiled comic-book narratives 
involving famous contemporary and 
historical philosophers and cogni-
tive scientists, including UCSD’s own 
Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, a pro-
fessor and pioneer in the field of 

neuroscience.
According to Kjaer, Beltrán 

and Satorre actually interviewed 
Ramachandran prior to composing 
their “Modeling Standard,” which is 
featured in the UAG. This interview, 
as well as Ramachandran’s revolu-
tionary mirror box device, are incor-
porated into the storyline of the com-
ics.

They created artificial connec-
tions between historical events and 
figures to create a narrative that 
brings together Ramachandran and 
fictional characters like the villain 
Fantomás, Kjaer said.

Altogether, the ANOMALIA 
exhibit is an experiment in reinter-
preting facts, perceptions and data. 
The result is an exhibit that toes the 
line between art and science, and that 
challenges the audience to see data in 
a different way.

season with 84. Lizotte’s performance 
earned her co-MVP honors, shared 
with San Diego State’s Pezzolla. 

The Tritons now turn their 
attention to the WWPA conference 
tournament, to be held at Canyonview 
Pool this weekend, April 27-29.

UCSD — the reigning WWPA 
champion — has secured the second 
seed with its 8-2 conference record. 
The Tritons sit behind first-seed 
Loyola Marymount, which defeated 
the Tritons 7-15 last month. 

The Lions enter the tournament 
with a perfect 10-0 WWPA record. 
Cal State Bakersfield, who defeated 
the Tritons back in February 11-12, 
sit in the third seed.

UCSD’s first opponent will be 
seventh-seed Sonoma State (5-10). 

The Tritons have met Sonoma 
only once in 2012, defeating the 
Seawolves 14-9 in the beginning of 
March. 

“It’s going to sound cliché but 
we play Sonoma first, and that’s all 
we’re thinking about,” Kreutzkamp 
said. “There’s been too many mix-
ups in the past for us not being ready 
for that first opponent, and we’ve 
already played Sonoma this year so 
we have game tape on them, and 
we’ll practice all week for Sonoma. 
All week.”

UCSD’s first game is scheduled for 
this Friday, April 27 at Canyonview 
Pool at 4:30 p.m.

Water Polo
to Host 
WWPA 
Tournament

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — Last weekend, 
April 19-21, the Tritons split 
themselves between the Mount Sac 
Relays in Walnut, California and 
the seventh annual Soka Peace 
Invitational. 

The Tritons came out big for the 
Soka Peace Invitational, held at Soka 
University in Aliso Viejo, California, 
where UCSD saw 15 Tritons win 
their individual events. 

Cal State San Marcos, Biola 
University and a few members of 
the Canadian Olympic team served 
as the main competition for the 
Tritons, but the standout on April 
20 was 2008 U.S. Olympian discus 
thrower Ian Waltz. Waltz won the 
discus throw with a stadium record 
of 188’10” to beat Triton junior Dane 
Sandifer, who threw 158’3”.

The second day of competition 
began well as freshman thrower 
Nash Howe hurled a personal best 
in the javelin, with a mark of 192’10” 
to win the event. 

“I had the best practice of my 

life last week with [head coach 
Tony Salerno] and that helped 
tremendously with the mental aspect 
of things,” Howe said. “But when 
it all came down to it, there was 
finally no thinking interfering with 
my throwing. If I can replicate that 
again at the [Triton Invitational] this 
weekend in the face of elite throwers 
and Division I standouts from across 
the nation, there’s no doubt in my 
mind that the automatic qualifying 
mark for nationals is within reach.”

The throw also moves Nash up 
from 11th all-time to just fourth 
in program history. The throw is 
just 9” short of an NCAA national 
qualifying mark. Senior team 
captain Nick Howe — older brother 
of Nash Howe — won the high jump, 
clearing 6’3” before attempting 6’7”.

Freshman sprinter Keith Rose 
also had a personal best in only his 
second 400m race of the year; he ran 
a 49.1 second sprint that puts him at 
ninth all-time at UCSD. Elder sister 
Jackie Rose, senior sprint captain, 
meanwhile won the 400m dash on 
the women’s side with a time of 
55.5 seconds with freshman Sabrina 

Pimentel placing second with a time 
of 57.75 seconds. Pimentel’s time 
is good enough to move her up to 
tenth on the all-time UCSD list. 

Senior shot-putter Ryan Eckert 
kicked in the door with a 51’11” 
effort to win the event over a 43’9” 
throw by junior Matthew Endler. 

“Well I gotta do at least 53’ at 
[the Triton Invitational] this coming 
weekend,” Eckert said. “But really I 
want to hit 56’ so I can go to NCAA 
Nationals. At this point in the season 
I’ve been doing better in practice 
than in meets, throwing 55’ pretty 
easily. I just need to translate that 
easiness into competition and throw 
big.”

On the Olympic-hopeful side 
there were several Triton Track wins. 
With no competition to push the bar 
up, it was a hard day for jumpers, 
but alumnus Linda Rainwater won 
the high jump with a height of 5’7”, 
several inches below her personal 
best. Fellow 2011 alumnus Kelly 
Fogarty also won her event, the 
200m dash, with a time of 23.85.

At the Mount Sac meet, senior 
decathlete Nicholas DeBeaubien 

logged a great performance, setting 
a new personal record of 6079 points 
— just shy of an NCAA National 
qualifier. 

The mark places DeBeaubien 
to fifth in the CCAA standings. 
DeBeaubien’s biggest personal 
records came in the 1500m, where 
he improved by over 20 seconds, 
and in the long jump, where he went 
from 19’6” to 20’6”. 

When asked after the meet, 
Salerno said that the Soka Invitational 
served as great preparation for the 
approaching postseason. 

“It was a perfect meet for this 
weekend on a great facility heading 
into Triton Invitational and 
conference in the next few weeks,” 
Salerno said in an email interview.

Next weekend’s Triton 
invitational will be one of UCSD’s 
most important meets so far this 
year. The  Invitational will be held 
this Friday through Saturday, April 
28-29 at the UCSD track and field 
complex.

The No. 21 UCSD Women’s Water Polo team fell 5-10 to Division I No. 9 San Diego 
State last Friday, April 19 in the 
Harper Cup at Canyonview Pool.

The 11th annual cup match, 
named in honor of 31-year tenured 
UCSD men’s head water polo coach 
Denny Harper, was also the Tritons’ 
last home game of the season.

UCSD opened the cup by 
honoring its five graduating 
seniors: center Kirsten Bates, driver 
Katherine Biehle, utility Natalie 
Peng, goalkeeper Allie Taylor and 

attacker Jessica Tran. 
Despite the 5-10 score by the 

buzzer, the game remained close 
until midway into the second quarter. 

Goals from Tran and sophomore 
utility Sarah Lizotte tied the game 
at 2-2, before the Aztecs went on a 
4-0 run. 

San Diego State’s Meaghan Poland 
and Amber Pezzolla teamed to put 
away four goals past Triton keeper 
Allie Taylor, to take a 6-2 lead into 
the second half.

Taylor kept the Aztecs scoreless 
in the third quarter, as the Tritons 
pulled to within two, behind two 
goals from Lizotte.

But in the fourth quarter, still 

down 4-6, the San Diego State offense 
caught fire, with four different Aztecs 
recording goals in the last period to 
cement the win. 

“We had talked all week long that 
if we play up to our potential, come 
out with some excitement, we can 
hang with any team in the country,” 
UCSD head coach Brad Kreutzkamp 
said. “The Aztecs are an amazing 
team and if we’re hanging with them, 
1-0, 2-1, then hey, we’re ready for 
our conference championships next 
week.”

Lizotte’s game high, four goals,

MEN’S TENNIS —The No. 19 
nationally ranked UCSD Men’s 
Tennis team ended its regular season 
with a win on the road against Point 
Loma Nazarene last Friday, April 19. 

The Tritons, who had lost their 
previous eight matches, may have 
since fallen out of contention for a 
postseason berth.

“It was nice to get a win after a 
tough streak,” UCSD head coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said to the UCSD 
Athletic Department. “We’re very 
happy to finish the year with a win.”

UCSD took a narrow 5-4 victory 
over the Sea Lions, edging Point 
Loma 2-1 in the doubles component, 
with both teams taking three matches 
apiece in the singles component. 

The makeshift pairing of 
freshman Kona Luu and sophomore 
Devon Sousa — whose usual doubles 
partner, senior Austin West was 
unable to participate due to injury — 
fought for a tight 9-8 win. 

The pairing of sophomore Max 
Jiganti and senior Sam Ling, who 
have won their past four matches 
together, recorded a strong 8-3 
win, while UCSD’s largely untested 
freshman team of Mark Meyer and 
Trevor Dell suffered a close 8-6 loss. 

Jiganti and Sousa found more 
success in their singles matches, as 
both Tritons walked away with wins. 
Jiganti, who seems to be peaking late 
in the year, (having put together an 
18-3 record in singles matches this 
season) secured the win in the No. 2 
spot. The sophomore defeated Point 
Loma’s KC Ensley with scores of 6-1 

and 6-3.
Sousa won in straight sets in the 

No. 5 match, while freshman Guy 
Giubilato, another underclassman 
who has had little opportunity on the 
court this season, won the singles No. 
6 match 6-2, 6-3.

Ling and Luu both fell in straight 
sets, while senior Chapman Chan 
was edged in the No. 1 bout in three 
games, 1-6, 7-6, 10-8.

The Tritons finished their 
regular season which they started in 
February, by going 9-1 with a 13-10 
overall record.

No. 19 UCSD will hear if it 
qualifies for the NCAA Division 
II National Championships this 
Tuesday, April 24.
