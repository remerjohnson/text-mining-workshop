CEP Drops Plus-Minus Clause 
AFT Claims Tenure 
Criteria Hurt Af-Ac 

by Robert.. Rehm 

" In the granting of tenure 
appointments, UCSD has 
traditionally weighted 
scholarship in the form of 
publications far in excess of 
other established criteria 
(teaching, service)," says an 
Ame rican Federation of 
Teac hers (AFT) paper 
delivered to members of the 
UCSD Budget Committee

especially hard because 
they have been required to 
expend equal energies in 
teaching and building new 
programs and courses at the 
relatively new college 
rather than deviding their 
time to publishable 
research . 

"The name of the game 
used to be research but now 
it's practise . The situation 
has changed but tenure 
procedures are still the 
same," he commented .

people have had to

The controversial plus/ minus grading feature 
originally recommended by the Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP) was not included in the 
grading scheme adopted by the Academic Senate 
Tuesday. 

The AS accepted a mandatory P/ NP policy for all 199 
courses effective next year . 

Dr. Leonard Newmark, CEP Chairman, told the AS, 
" The student poll reported that students on this campus 
don't want the plus/ minus grading system . Added with 
the lack of strong faculty majority in favor of the 
plus/minus feature induced the CEP to recommend that 
the plus/ minus system be dropped from this grading 
proposal." 

UCSD professors at the Academic Senate meeting had 
no objection towards the CEP recommendation 
evidenced by lack of any discussion on the matter. 
Minor changes were approved, though none severely 
affected the proposal. 

According to Newmark the maJor reason for 
eliminating the plus/ minus feature was overwhelming 
student opposition . " It wasn't a large issue," he told the 
Triton Times. " It appeared to be faculty initiated, 
consequently creating student opposition ." Newmark 
emphasized that the feature might come up again " in 
five years or so when all the students who remember it 
are gone." , . 

The 199 P/ NP policy, a major issue, received support 
from Provosts and most professors at the AS gathering. 
" This campus has more 199's than any other campus, " 
Newmark told the Academic Senate. "The policy does

repeated abuses of 199's were found throughout the 
campus. "Too many students are getting A' ," and 
"bottle washing for credit ," were among the c hargE'~ 
questioning the quality of 199 courses 

Currently, the CEP gives final approval for all 199's 
However, approval comes approximately "two-third ot 
the way into the quarter," according to ewmark , "and 
Its hard to withdraw cred it that far into the quarter " 

The approved policy allows for exceptions ub)ect to 
approval by the Instructor and the Departm('nt 
Chairman .

On a FridilY in M:..y, 1969, in conference room A on 
s campus, UClA philosophy professor Angela 

is r('ad the "non-negotiable demands" of the Black 
tudent~ ( ouncil and the Mexican-American Youth 

. to Chancellor McCi11. 
The document, "Lumumba-Zapata College BSC-

YA Demands for The Third College, UCSD," rejected 
e "entire oppressive structure of America," and 
If'd the struggle for a college devoted " to the relevant 

for minority youth and the study of social 
blems of all people," 

According to the document, "Contradictions whi h 
'ned America in the past are now threatening to 

ihilate the entire societal edifice ... Racism runs 
t In the educational system, while America, in a 
'UI:'~IO-n, nitarian stance, proudly proclaims that it 

key to equal opportunity for all. This I th 
racy our generation must destroy. 

"De pite the Chicano rebellions in the Southwe t and 
. Black revoks in the cities, the University of 

allfornia, San Dit'go, which is a part of the oppressive 

system, has not changed its institutional role . The puny 
reforms made so far are aimed at pacifiying the revolts 
and sapping our strength , We therefore not only em-
phatically demand that radical changes be made, we 
propose to execute these changes ourselves! " 

The BSC and MAYA had been petitioning the ad-
ministration to give greater recognition to the needs of 
minority students . 

The Third College Planning Committee and faculty 
proceeded with separate sets of plans, because there 
was no formal interface between the two groups 

After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr ., the 
insufficiency of education for minorities in America 
became a national issue of sorts. However, at UC D, 
proposals from BSC and MAYA, among them propo als 
concerning the naming of the college and B and 
MA YA ity-wide coordination, were ignored, I adlng to 
increasing concern within the groups, and eventually to 
various sit-ins. Soon after, Provost Armon Rappaport 
resigned, and a new faculty and planning ommlttee 
were e tabli hed . 

Many more demands en ued, with a patt rn 
developing of dE'mand, count r~ffer, and rele tion of

just pop my head into an 
office," she explained, "and 
say, 'Hi, I'm Stephanie 
Harris. Who are you?' " She 
was elected a represen-
tative from Muir College to 
the Associated Students in 

. the Spring of 1972. When 
the Associa ted Students 
collapsed, she was ap-
pointed by the Chancellor 
to SLie. 

Last summer, Harris held 
a full-time staff position, 
jointly funded by the 
Student Affairs office, the 
Planning Department, and 
the Muir Dean 's office. In 
addition to working on the 
planning of Fourth College, 
the Muir orientation , and 
various Student Affairs 
committees, she spent 
considerable effort trying to 
insure a smooth transition 
from SLiC to TUSe. 

Now that her duties with 
TUSC are behind her, Harris 
made some frank ob-
servations about the 
Student Cooperative. "The 
Co~p has a lot of poten-
tial ," she said . "For the first 
time ince I've been here, 
there are a lot of leaders." 
Regarding its indirect 
representation and ex-
tremely informal 
orga ni zation, he com-
ment d, " tudents here 

aren't into electing peopl 
and e tablishing a 
hierarchy." 

She feel that there arE' 
some problem with the 
present Co~p arrangement 
One problem area IS h'" 
open voting featurE' 
" Someone could bring In an 
interest group and just WiPE' 
out everything," she said 
The proposed awarding of 
academic credit for active 
participation i n the 
Cooperative will need a lot 
of work to be approved, she 
pointed out . Also, she feels 
that there will have to bE' at 
least a few regularl 
sc hedul ed meetings 
Finally, she observed that , 
"The Co~p is only gOing to 
work if there is a lot ot 
publicity ." 

Her greatest disap-
pointment was lack 01 
participation in tLldf'nt 
government " The hardE'~t 
thing to deal With wa lad .. 
of people. and a lack 01 a 
variety of people " 'v\-ht'n 
the same p ople alway~ E'nd 
up doing the work, he ,aid , 
"You Just get burned out ' 

How does she feel anOLit 
it all , now that she IS 
moving on to other things? 
" I'm glad I did It," h ,aid 
" I really learned a lot "

rewarded," he said. 
Heifetz said that Third 

Colleie professor, Dr. Joyce 
Justus, Urban and Rural 
StudieS, and Muir professor, 
Dr.· Pat ledden, Math , are 
tIM> latest victims of this 
polr Ii. I t is felt, he said, 
that ooth are excellent 
teachers and administrators 
but were denied tenure 
because they have not 
published heavily. No 
figures are available at this 
time on how many faculty 
members have been denied 
tenure on the basis of lack 
of reseilrch . 

"To assure maximum and 
prompt interchange of 
ideas on this matter, we 
would suggest holding a 
meeting of concerned 
faculty and students with 
members of this and next 
year's Budget committee," 
states the AFT report . Dr. 
William Frazier, of the 
Pb't'5icS department , 
cliairman of the Budget 
committee told the Triton 
Times that a meeting will 
definitely be held . 

Three tenured Professors, 
Charles Thomas, Urban and 
Rural Studies ; Faustina 
Solis, Communitv 
Medi ci ne; and Josheph 
Sommers, literature; will 
represent the AFT at the 
meeting . 

Dr. Thomas stated that he 
felt "tempered optimism ," 
In a recent T.T. interview. 
"I'm prepared for almost 
anything. This is somewhat 
precedent setting . There is 
no question that many 
difficulties have to be 
addressed here ." 

" We' re not recom· 
mending an en d to 

scholarship and creativ i ty . 
Thomas added, "There is 
nothing wrong with the 
development of community 
programs and work with 
groups as other expressions 
of creativity." 

Budget Chairman Frazier 
said that there is "already a 
considerable flexibility" in 
the criteria for ad -
vancement to tenure . He 
added, "Unconventional 
c reative efforts ;'n 
developing programs can 
be publisheable ," and 
"should be" published in 
order to share ideas that 
proove successful. 

Frazier continued, 
"When junior faculty 
members are asked to do an 
extraordinary amount of 
work, research becomes a 
problem ." He said that 
according to current criteria 
"heavier responsibility in 
one area can be balanced 
by lighter responsibility in 
another area ." It is possible, 
he said, to balance research 
and teaching as long as high 
quality is retained in both 
areas . 

"I'm not really convinced 
that the rules need to be 
changed," said Frazier, "but 

I could be convinced" if the 
situation does not improve. 

Frazier , Thomas and 
Heifetz all felt that there 
was a lack of com-
munication on this issue. 
Frazier said, "We may have 
gotten people here under 
ci rcumstances they didn't 
fully understand." He said 
that the various depart-
ments and provosts should 
advise the junior faculty 
about what they must do to 
be promoted . " It's a matter 
of good, hard advice at the 
right time. 

The AFT paper recom-
mended two actions: 

1. "We request that the 
Budget Committee amend 
its 1973-74 Annual Report 
to highlight specifically its 
contribution to im-
plementing UCSD's Af· 
firmative Action program 
by noting, of all minority 
and women candidates 
reviewed, how many and 
what percent of total new 
appointments, merit in-
creases and promotions by

possibilities of mistakes, a threat to established values 
and bases of power. 

One administrator said at the time he was worried 
about outside interference and poorly-trained police re-
enforcements . The San Diego Police Department had 
reserve troops stationed in the eucalyptus grove north 
of the campus ready to march on the campus in case of 
unrest . 

Next week 25 charter students will be graduated from 
Third Colleg~, all students who fought for a belief . Their 
aim was a college that would "prepare minority youth 
for leadership." Their goal was Third College and they 
are the fruit of its success . 

candidates and will face 
longtime incumbent 
Republican Bob Wilson in 
the 41st Congressional 
District . O'Conner said she 
will concentrate on such 
issues as inflation and 
conaressional reform rather 
than Wateraate in .the 
November election . 

In North County's 43rd 
Conaressional District, 
Democrat Bill Bandes has 
won the thankless task of 
opposing Incumbent 
Republican Clair Burgener. 
Bandes said he plans to 
"inform the voters of how 
bad Clair Burgener really 

.is ." In another North 
County race, incumbent 
Lee Taylor led seven other 
candidates with 35% of the 
vote fo r Supervisor. His 
opponent in November will 
be liberal Mick.y Fredman . 

All Demo c'ratic 
Assemblyman won 
renomination as only Pete 
Chacon faced any op-
position . The Republican 
primaries were extremely 
close as Mike Bollman won 
the nod in the 77th District 
and will face incumbent 
Bob Wilson . In the 76th 
Assembly D is trIct , 
Republicans chose Rod 
Smith in a mIld upset over 
Ned Huntington . Smith told 
the Triton TImes he would 
run his campaign by 
showing how Incumbent 
larry Kapiloff has "changed 
his positions". Kapiloff said 
he expected the race would 
be tough and chided 
Democrats for not showi ng 
up in more numbers at the 
polls . 

Present at the Election 

Central Headquarters was 
Senator John Tunney who 
predicted that the 
Democrats will beat 
Houston Flournoy. Also in 
attendance was former lt 
Governor and Secretary of 
HEW Robert Finch . Finch , 

Assemblyman Kap,ioff 
of course, believes that 
Houston Flournoy WIll 
defeat Brown . I asked FInch 
if he was going to be In 
California in 1976 He saId 
he would be around dOing 
something . My guess IS that 
Finch will be opposing the 
very same John Tunney for 
U.S Senator

Last Word In Campus Music 
The UCSD music department is 

ponsoring several events this coming 
week, all to be held in MC 409. The first , 
to be presented Saturday, at 8:30 p .m . 
will be a concert by the Early Music 
Quartet. The quartet is a group of 
dedicated musicians involved in the 
performance of .early mu~ic . as it . was 
originally .conceIved. TheIr Ideal IS to 
recreate the musical mood of the Middle 
Ages, Renaissance, and early Baroque 
periods . Led by james Paul, the group 
will perform several short pieces by 
various composers, covering the period 
from 1350 to 1643 A.D. 

This Sunday promises to be a busy day 
for music buffs. At 3 p.m ., a program 
entitled "Music Now and Then" will be 
performed by an instrumental ensemble, 
featuring as cello soloist Lorie Kirkell. 
Two of the pieces are designed for cello 
solos: Bach's "Suite #1 in C major for 
Solo Cello", and a composition by 
contemporary composer, Barney Childs, 

entitled " Interbalances III tor Solo 
Cello". Other compositions featuring 
Ms. Kirkell will be Beethoven's "12 
Variations in G major", and Brahms 
"Sonata in F major" . Sunday evening at 
8:15, the UCSD Chamber Choir and 
Chamber Singers will present a varied 
program of choral music under the 
direction of David Chase. The evening 
will close with a Latin translation of 
"Winnie the Poo." 

Lastly, on Monday evening at 6:15, the 
San Diego Chamber Orchestra, under the 
direction of Glenn Block, will present a 
program of Rossini 's Sonata No. 1 for 
Strings", Stravinsky's "Octet for Winds", 
and "Military Symphony No. 100" by 
Haydn. 

The concert will premiere john 
Celona's new work in addition to the 
other classical fare . Celona, UCSD's 
composer-in -residence , is currently 
curator of archives for the UCSD Center 
for Music Experiment. 

A View of the Cosmos 
Recently added to the 

museums of Balboa Park, 
the Reuben H. Fleet Space 
Theat re wi II be presenting 
"Cosmos-the Universe of 

Eisley". The first full-
length feature scheduled, 
Space Theatre Executive 
Director , W . Michael 

Ilivan said " Cosmos" 
represents an enormous 
undertaking. It places the 
audience In the midst of the 

n Ings of time and the

Earth." 
The new production is 

. IJast!d on the writings of the 
well-known writer, Loren

Renaissance Scholarship 
Planning for the future? You may remember having 

read a notice In the e pages weeks ago about'lhe up-
coming International conference of distInguished 
Amencan and furopean scholar5 ' " First Images of 
America The Impact of the New World on the Old," 
which will be held at lJCLA on r ebruary 6 through 9, 
1975. 

Well , you may remember that the cost of this con-
ference was somewhat high, and seemed to preclude 
student attendance to a large extent . Well , don 't give up 
hope. In an effort to make this academic event available 
to UC students, the University of California is providing 
a number of cholarship to cover the cost of tran-
sportation and lodgings in Los Angeles, 

The conference will engage a number of eminent 
scholars presenting the results of their original in-
vestigation into the magnitude and meaning of the early 
discovery in the realms of art, music, literature, 
economics, international law, and a host of other 
topics . 

For more information and scholarship applicatio'ls, 
contact The Center for Medieval and Renaissance 
Studies, Bunche Hall , UCLA, Los Angeles, Calif . 90024 . 
Tel : (213) 625-1660. 

Don't be surprised, if, upon entering 
the Central Library this month, you are 
confronted by a stuffed dummy. It's part 
of the Third Annual California Fibers 
Show, on view in the second floor lobby 
of the Central Library 

The show IS comprised of 29 works by 
17 artists . From Gail Louis' whimsical 
" jester" (pictured above). to the three, 
dimensional free-formed weaving en-
titled "Tree Stump", the show explores 
the numf?rOUS directions in creative 
texti Ie work 

Among the pieces on exhibit, are 
highly-s tyliz d weav ings anrl wall -
hangings ilnri rolorful and cheerful 

qutlted forms . Embodying the spirit of 
this exhibit is the group banner, " The 
Seeds of the Earth . The Fruits of the Sky" 
The banner IS a striking combination of 
fabric squares, evoking sensations from 
recognizable objects and shapes 

This annual show IS presented by 
California Fabrics , a group of 
professional artists and craftswomen 

The group is actually a sort of 
cooperative, with each member sharing 
administrative work and contributing 
pieces for the annual juned show-this 
one to be ludged by Ellamarie Wooley 
Th show will be on view through june

Letter From Ed it~r 
As I now wri te the last thing that I will write for 

UCSD's Sports Page, I would like to personally wish my 
successor Kirk Robinson good luck . Kirk, who started 
out as a writer only th is year, has been my assistant for 
thp last quarter or so, and I believe that this page wi ll be 
in good hands with him. 

I would also like to thank all the membe's of the 
Physical Education, Recreation and Intramura l 
Departments for all the help they have given me this 
year. I hope that these departments, which I feel are 
already the best in the nation, will continue with their 
tradition of developing the mind as well as the body, for 
both are equally important. . 

As I look back on my two years here, I realize that I 
have learned more than any class or anyone person 
could have taught me. I have gainea the experience that 
comes with interatting with all of these people. 

My most heartfelt thanks go out to all of those who 
joined the whole sports staff in experiencing life and 
sports through our small literary contribution to thi s 
publication . I would also like to thank all the people 
who contributed to us by writing articles anonymously 
or otherwise and to my staff; Mark Liska, Tracy Ber-
tolucci, even you, Larry Baldwin , I wish you luck in your 
further endeavors. Most of all Kirk, may your working 
hours be half of what mine were, may your stories all 
come in on time and may you cont inue the traditions of 
excellence started by Mike Rath (my predecessor) three 
years ago . 

To those of you who I was not lucky enough to meet 
and know, you will probably think that this is nothing 
but sentimental drivel, and you are probably right, but I 
felt that the above things had to be said before I leave 
UCSD, probably for life. I will remember these last two 
years as the start of an exciting journey called college 
life and will not forget the lessons that I have been 
taught . Good-bye and Good-luck!

Sports Staff's itness Revealed 
by Kirk Robinson 

As reported three weeks ago, Athletic Director Howard 
and Dr. jim White of the Physical Education 
developed a series of tests that determif\l'! a person's ' 
fitness profi le." Once the profile has been made Hunt 
are then able to determine what sort of activities 
prescribed to help the individual in correcting any defici 
his/ her fitness profi le. 

These tests have been developed primari ly to help in 
of preventive medicine for both heart and lung disease. 
they use can detect early signs of possible terldencil'<.J. 
heart attacks and lung disease, then certain exercises 
prescribed to negate or reduce those tenden cies . 

After doing the original article, Dr. White and Mr. Hu 

Kirk Robinson 

me in to go through the testing experience and to find out 
I really was . When I relayed this information to Eric 
boss, the Sports Editor), he came up with the idea of 
whole staff tested, so away we went , to be tested for 
unfitness, as the case may be . 

Hunt and White have worked out a very systematic 
testing individuals. When I arrived for my tests my pulse 
blood pressure were taken firs t. They I was ushered Into 
for an EKG, body fat measuremen ts and luhg 
oxygen utilization tests. 

In going over my profile with Howard Hunt a few da~1 
found that my pulse rate was a little above average 
blood pressure was quite good. The blood pressure m p ;l(lIrn_ 
is taken in two ways; first when the heart is rn,,' r>,r l 
providing the systoli c blood pressure; the second way 
pressure is measured is the diastolic measurement, 
blood pressu re is measured when the heart is at rest.

The next test that was taken was the body fat measurement, 
this is where I f lunked the test . Being a little overweight, like 
never losing my baby fat, I fell somewhat below average on this 
test. The test is taken by applying a set of caliper~ to various parts 
of the body and measuring the millimeters of skin fold . 

Once this was done I was tested on a lung capacity machine. 
This machine somehow measured the forced vital capacity of the 
lung (I did rather well on that test), the forced expiratory volumn 
(how much of the tota l air capacity can be expelled in one 
second, thus determining whether ornot there might be OIOCKa,£el 
within the air passageways of the lung, and finally the abi lity 
the blood stream to utilize the oxygen that th lung can provide, 
here I didn't do so well, giving evidence of a lot of crap in ye olde 
blood stream . 

MolIrlc [Chet Chebunslci l 
I then did several exercises to determine grip strength 

(average). trunk flexloll (average). and abdominal strength 
(exce ll ent) 

Then there was the written part of the test to measure my 
anxieties The test showed that I was omewhat anxious, but in 
talking to Mr Hunt he felt that the test didn 't apply to well to 
college students, as the student hasn'treally settled into an 
established lifestyle, like the average adult 

Two heart tests were taken during the cours of the afternoon 
The first was a resting EKG, where the electrodes are used to 
detect heart murmers I d idn't show any igns 'J f such problems. 
The other test on the heart was a working test where electrodes 
were attached to the chest and I then pretended to bicycle at 30 
mph for about 8 minutes During thiS time the heart rate and 
blood pressure was monltered, looking for sign s of strain on the 
heart. Again I tested out quite well 

Several days after I was tested, Eric Ralsters and Tracy Ber-
tolucci were also tested (Mark Liska and Chet Cheblnski were 
unavailable) . 

Er ic tested out rather well Hi s major deficiences seemed to be 
his resti ng heart rate (too high) , oxygen utilization (bad blood), 
grip strength , and trunk flexion . He also IS a rather anxious 
person . Could it be that he worries to much about getting the 
paper out in time and whether his writers will come up with 
stories? 

Tracy, the female member of the staff, has been responsib le 
for coverning such sports as the men's tennis, women's. 
volleyball , and basketball , and badminton . She also tested out 
better than the rest of the staff. Her only rea l deficency is in the 
area of fat mass. Other than that she tested out above average or 
average in everything else. More power to the female athlete . 

Now that we have found how unfit we are, Mr. Hunt and Dr . 
White have provided some nice remedies to our unfitness, like a. 
lot of exercise . he sugges ted that we each exercise (aerobic) at 
least 4 times a week for at least half an hour . The activity should 
be carried out at a sustained heart rate, determined by how fit 
you are to begi n with. ' 

Now that the year has come to an end we are off and running 
so as to get in shape for next year.

Calpirg Ripoff 

C.lpi,. is well on its w.y to becoming. consumer ripoff. In its efforts to be the 
gre.t conlur" .... dvoc.te it has miued the point of beinl filir to the people who are 
fundinlthem, in their eHoris to let more and more fundi. They are becominl a self-
righteous bureaucr.cy which sees itself as needing inordinate sums of money to 
survive ilnd eternally lrow. They.re fillllng into the same tr.p as the people they are 
reporti .... Iilinst, of needing to ripoff the consumer 50 thilt they can continWilly 
lrow. 

'The Iiltest of theR mowes is the illiocation of 51,300 of CommuniCiitions Bo.rd 
funds for Cillpi,. Reports, which they have persuaded the board to treill OIlS iI sub-
siderilry journal. Not only hal the board liven them the money for next ye.r, but also 
they hiVe liven them a tacit promiR that they will get more funds in the future and 
be treated as a publication, although this is not their prim.ry function. 

Finillly, the board took thil action without even taking a clOie look ilt the Calpi,. 
budget. That buclJet wu full of questions waiting to be asled, indudinl over 51,500 
in overbudget for their own projected salOllries. There il the question of iI 51,300 item 
for "campus expenses" which does not include 52,300 for rent, telephones, fumiture, 
etc. There is ill,o the provision for other publiCiitions. 

Finally, the real question rests in the nOIIture .nd amount of the total (0111 pi,. fundinl. 
Again, according to their budget they ilre expecting h;J receive 514,000 from SDSU and 
$4,500 from UCSD students through inserts in the registration pilckets. They hiVe now 
come before the .Communications BOiIrd .nd received iln ildditional 51,300, money 
which could be used to stirt a re.l subsidiary journal, and the board seems to be 
unwilling to even look closely at their material before approving them. The board told 
Ujimil [the Blilck Student newsletter ] for almost a year now that money is hilrd to 
come by, and Ujima published out of other funds while (alpirg had over 57,000 from 
this campus alone. Now Calpirg is able to come before the board demonstrating a 
projected income greater thiln the boud's alloution to TT, and get even more 
money. While we support the concept of Calpi,., we must question their behavior in 
tryinl to obtain funds. The Triton Times feels the Communications Board decision is 
very unfair, and we urge the board to reconsider their decision. 

Our Own Threat to Freedom 

One of our basic desires is security, yet 
Ironically our actual condition is fraught 
With inseCUrity But rather than grapple 
With this basic condition head on, we 
tend to evade this struggle pres nted to 
us, preferring instead the false-security of 
our self-made delusions. When I first 
came to UCSD, in the fall of 1970, most 
people appeared to be cognizant of this 
very real rift between the ideal of 
security and its contrary physical state. 
In various manners many attempted to 
meet the challenge of uOiting the Ideal 
with the actual (according to the 
divergent causes in which many viewed 
the essential root of the insecurity to 
exist). Nothing was taken at face value by 
ei ther students or faculty Through a 
constant questioning the validity of 
virtually every idea on every subject "th 
search for knowledge" was not an empty 
phrase at the UCSD of 1970 However, 
with the "end" of the Vietndm War in 
early 1973. many of us have once again 
lulled ourselves to sleep, momentarily 
secure within our individual delusions 

The pretense of security has proceeded 
to overwhelm us . It is daily viSible in our 
classrooms where intellectual exchange 
between students and faculty seems to 
have become the exception rather than 
the rule which it was only a short time 
ago Inaction seems to have superceded 
action, and In our present state of 
lethargiC superfluousness we present 
greater threat to society than those 
dangers we so relentlessly assaulted only 
a hort time ago. 

Just as there is a true security as op-
posed that false security which I claim 
many of us have become immersed in, 
there are also two levels of reality, the 
objective anc the subjective. The ob-
jective ~ealitJ is best defined as a 
representatior f the world of fact in its 
totality . The' ubjective reality exists as 
the fiction thu the mind creates to give 
the world a lo~i 31 and C0n5i,tcn orrlpr. 
Hence, one's d~lusion of security is an 
essential egr'lent of one's subj ctive 
rea lity . 

In the world of fact, subjective reality 
IS visible In a number of ways For in-
stance, it may b ba~ed mE'rely upon the 
idea that ~ applness and therefore 
security stem from the acqUisi tion of 
material goods Or, subjective reality 
may take th form of ideology, be it 
Maflosm . Nazism, Christianity, Judaism 
ptc Grdnted, subwctlve reality may be 
essential If on(' IS to contrive a logically 
('ooslstent order to th(' world, but 
rll'V rthel ess It IS thl~ vNy contrivance

by David Buchbinder 
Jonathan Swift succintly stateS: "For If 
we take an examination of what is 
generally understood by happiness .. we 
shall find all its properties and adjuncts 
will herd under this short definition, that 
it is a perpetual possession of being well 
deceived." It is this very possession of 
being well deceived which will shortly 
destroy us if we proceed to allow this 
possession of ours to overcome us un-
checked. For in our blind obeisance to 
material or ideology we ultimately 
become slaves to that obeisance. We 
become secure in our subjectivity, but 
the price of that security is our very 
freedom . 

The Problem Is Here 
At UCSD' both of the taskmasters of 

security can be seen (i t is important to 
note that while two distin t "groups" are 
discussed, both are mutual , and indeed 
at UCSD, elements of both "groups" can 
be found present within specific in-
diViduals) Those imbued with the 
delusion of material lust may be so 
defined as the "don't cares". If one were 
to exam i ne the current state of apathy, 
one would probably discern that those 
most apathetic to that which is external 
to them are probably those most sub-
dued by the mirage of EI Dorado. These 
are the people who Nathanael West, in 
The Day of the Locusts, describes as 
those "who come to California to die." 
To further quote West : " Once there, they 
discover that sunshine isn't enough . They 
get tired of oranges, even of avocado 
pears and passion frUit . Nothing hap-
pens . They don't know what to do with 
their time ... Their boredom becomes 
more and more terr ible. They realize that 
they've been tricked and burn with 
resentmenL .They have been cheated 
and betrayed . They have slaved and 
saved for nothing." 

When the delusion is cracked open, 
the "don't cares" can on ly burn down all 
that has previously tricked them : " No 
longer bored they sang and danced 
joyously in th red light of the flames." 
And when this occurs, the "don't cares" 
become immediately suscept ible to any 
ideology which purports to resolve th 
IS ue of security and happiness for them. 

These who follow Ideology may be 
defined as "blind obedi nts", for these 
people app ar to remain b lindly 
obedient to any system which claims to 
give the world a logical and consistent 
order. They qu stlon all els but the 
dialectic which they claim to ue "the 
light", be that light MarXism, Chrl tianlty, 
or any other dogmatically correct 
system Like the "don't cares", the "blind 
vbedients" would sacrifice anyth ing for

The Friday Evening War 
by Mario Savio 

.:ditor;5 note: 
Mario Savio was one of the leaders of 

the Free Speech Movement [FSM) at U.c. 
Berkeley in the mid-1960's. It was this 
incident that launched the campus 
activism of the late 60's and helped to 
create what is now called the New Left . . 

doing, we'll kill you ." But to the broader 
community another message is given ' 
the police are strong, and able to protect 
the ordinary, law-abiding citizen from 
the irrational violence of criminal 
terrorists. I n short, "Stick with us and 
we'll take care of you." But this econd 
message " to protect and to serve" is 
strangely contradicted . The anti -SLA 
hysteria did not begin with the shooting 
of Black school superintendent roster-
arguably an ordinary, law-abiding 
citizen . The hysteria began with th 
political kidnapping of the daughter of 
one of the wealthiest fami lies. Ordinary 
citizens are unlikely ever to be th 
victims of a political kidnapping, and a 
500-member police assault force has 
never before been cal led out against the 
alleged murderers of a Black man. 
Without in anyway endorSing the actions 
of the SLA, we must fa e squarely that 
the police can be counted on "to protect 
and to erve" only the wealthy and 
powerful. Unfortunately, this conclusion 
is strengthened by the location of the 
rriday Evening War in a poor community 
of Black citizens We must ask ourselves ' 
Would the police have ndangered lives 
and uestroyed property 0 reck lessly If 
the SLA suspects had been caught hiding 
in the wealthy, white subu rbs of Beverly 
Hills or Bel Air? 

Around midnight three nights after the 
Friday evening shootout rretween the 
Symbionese Liberation Army and the Los 
Angeles Police Department, as I was 
about to go to sleep, two reporters came 
to my apartment The reporters expressed 
the desire to do something to help save 
the life of Patty Hearst. To my total 
disbelief, the two reporters actually 
asked if I knew Patty Hearst's 
whereabouts, or if I could help make 
contact with her. I was surprised, and at 
first I viewed this midnight appeal as part 
of som bizarre fantasy. 

Once I had overcome my initial 
disbelief, however, I began to realize that 
this seemingly unbelievable requ t did 
not occur Within a vacuum . Thi~ was no 
Isolated inCident. Rather, It was the 
direct product of the hysterical sen-
sationalism now surrounding the entire 
"saga of Patty Hearst and the SLA"-an 
hysteria which easily could come to be 
directed at anyone who has been active 
in what the police or the press consider 
to be "the left." 

This wave of hysteria has swept 
through and around all of us. The most 
dramatic and horrifying example of just 
what thi~ hysteria can produce was seen 
live on coast-te-coast, prime-time TV last 
rriday eveni ng. A tactical police assau lt 
team of over 500 armed personnel 
employed a strategy which led to what 
the police have called a "war". As 
"warfare " the police justified the hOrrible 
and ex~essive tactics of shooting or 
burning to death their "enemy." 

Police agency officials argue that they 
had no choice; that they were faced with 
armed and dangerous terrorists; that they 
did in fact ca ll upon the usp ct to 
surrender; and that before opening 
weapons' fire they used tear gas . It was 
only after receiving a 'great blast of 
gunfi re, the police tell us, that they 
returned the gunfire. In short-as the 
police tell it-warfare was the only 
real istic or reasonable alternative. 

But was this really so~r had the police 
determined to stage a latter-day " public 
hanging?" Had the police decided to 
execute their enemies? Was there really 
no reasonable alternative to warfare-or 
had the police consciously determined 
that they would take no prisoners? 

As has been pointed out both by 
citizens groups and by area reSidents, a 
more humane and proven , practical 
alternative was in fact available. The 
alternative would Simply have been to 
wait out the suspects-by clearing the 
area surrounding the house, to protect 
the people of the neighborhood, and, 
perhaps, by ca lling in family and friends 
of the suspects to plead for their 
surrender. If it took days, or even a week 
or more, for that matter, any possible 
alternative would have been preferable 
to inflicting what was, in the words of 
Fmily Harris's father, a "horribl and 
u eless death." 

In the lurid peclacle of th(' rnday 
[venlng War, there SE'E'ms to be a doubl(' 
rnessage fo the potential oppon 'nb of 
th status quo thp police seem to b(' 
sayi ng, " If we don't likE' what you're' 

In their total rejection of reason and 
moderation, in chOOSing brutal and 
excessive method, the police have gone 
far beyond their proper functions as 
protectors and servants. They have taken 
on the roles of judge, jury and 
executioner. But IS this not the very 
essence 'of a police state? 

Now the atmosphere and the tactics of 
police-state control do not Simply 
materialize overnight, or by accident . In 
our specific, American situation the 
possibility of a police state has been 
rrea ted by consc i 0 us po Ii c i es 
culminating in the expenditure of vast 
sums of money by the Nixon ad-
ministration in the training of local law 
enforcemel'it officers in the warfare 
tactics of armed assault . The political 
hysteria behind the creation of such 
police machinery as the L.A. "Spec ial 
Weapons And Tactical Squad" (which 
spearheaded the Friday Evening War) is 
the salT)e sort of political hysteria ~hich 
led to John .Mitchell's "Red Squad," to 
Richard Nixon's "Plumbers Unit," and, in 
general, to what every American has 
come to know as the "Watergate." 

Once the potential for a police state 
exists, once the police machinery has 
been created and is poised for action-
then as we all have seen in the Watergate 
affair, few explicit orders regarding 
methods ever need to be given. All that is 
necessary is simply to unleash these 
special police forces, and to promote a 
general atmosphere which sanctions 
their special activities. Given the mere 
existence, in e~ery major city, of these 
highly developed, well-funded,' para-
military policp machines, the overall 
atmosphere epitomlled by " Watergate" 
has served as that offi c ial sanction-a 
green light for these brutal machines to 
do xa tly what they were created to do. 
to r tri ct, to sabotage, to intimidate, 
and, bluntly, to destroy all of us who are 
working for needf'd and meaningful 
SOCia l change

Six Spies Who Never Came 
In From the Cold 

If you watched that ritual annihilation 
in Los Angeles on May 17, don't you 
wonder : 

a. why over 500 law enforcement 
officers couldn 't somehow figure out a 
way to take six people alive? 

b. how they knew that the people in 
that little house were the ones they 
wanted, since they never saw them? 

c. how such an intense, all-consuming 
fire really started? The police, if you want 
to believe them, claim to have all the 
answers . If you have really examined the 
underpinnings of this case, however, you 
should be looking elsewhere for the 
truth . Again , severe space lim itations 
prohibit a real detailed analysis, but the 
following montage of fact and con-
jecture should put us well on the way to 
getting at the true happenings on May 
17: 

1 Randolph Hearst, among others , has 
charged that police cou ld have starved 
the SLA IX out or waited until they ran 
out of ammo. Police responded by saying 
they feared a break, si nce nightfall was 
coming (L A. Times, 5-24-74, p. 26) 
Come on now. 500 well-trained attack 
troops can't prevent an escape by six 
people. whom they have completely 
surround d? I f they were so terrified of 
the dark , why didn't they send out for 
some floodlights? 

2. Dr . L S. Wolfe, father of slain SLA 
member Willie Wolfe, says he has in-
formation that FBI and police officials 
" knew full well " that the SLA was in that 
house " many hours before the shootout 
itself" (S.F. Ch ronicle , 5-30-74) . 

3. All witnesses who were with the SLA 
in the house report that the SLA members 
eemed unaware that they were com-

pletely surrounded by police until the 
last minute (LA Times, 5-25-74, p 24) 
ThiS would seem to mean that they did 
not really expect to be hotly pursued 
They had moved very freely In the Bay 
Area, according to witnesses in the 
neighborhoods where they headquar-
ter d themselv s-this was- apparent also 
In the ease with which they moved to 

and from the bank robbery. The I 81 and 
police made a big show of tracking the 
SLA down, but they obviously didn't do 
it-un til LA j strongly suggest that th 
SLA was working for the government up 
until the time the government silenced 
them When the provo('ateurs in the SLA 
were given their assignmpnt, ~ee, one 
important detail was Withheld from 
them-the scenario requ I red thei r deaths 

4. Police first specu lated that the fire 
was tarted by a tear-gas cannister fired 
into the house (LA Times, 5-22-74, p 
36). Later LAP 0 Chi I Edward DaVIS 
said he was "convin ed" that Molotav 
cockta ils from the SLA arsenal were 
responsible (Ibid) Two eye witnesses, 
however, reported that police poured 
gasoline along the back of the building 
(Berkeley Barb, 5-24-74, p 8) 

5. Dr Wolfe claims that police "did in 
fact lire incendiary tar-gas deVices" Into 
the house and that "onp of th m turned 
the place Into an Inferno" (S F 
Chronicle, loc cit) 

6 While j was watching the whole 
thing on TV, a rumor circulated among 
the crowd and newspeople that police 
had fired an incendiary device into the 
house. I don't remember that rumor ever 
being dispelled, except, of course, by 
routine poli e denials of Dr Wolfe 's 
charges . 

7. Dr. Wolfe contends further "that 
police prevented firemen from at-
temptin g to exti nguish the blaze in its 
early stages and that some firemen were 
ordered not to enter the area 'even 
though in such situations the fi re 
department by law is in command of 
such operat ions' " (Ibid.) 

The fire , of course , destroyed any 
onceivable chance of capturi ng the SLA 

alive. But then. the above data suggests 
that this was a pre-meditated executlon-
thus no such chance ever existed and all 
attempts at capture were superficial, just 
part of the show You don't have to be 
any kind of expert 10 police tactics to 
know that. If you had your TV on for the 
dinnertime mas acre , you know. 

Friday Evening War 

continued from page 8 

We have een on the tube, lar/i:er than 
life, a bit of 1984. For as must be ap-
parent we now have here in the United 
States all the elements of a veritable, 
nationwide police state. To date they 
have been largely used only against those 
call "t he lelt" or " radicals." But as is 
shown in the contemporary development 
of police states in cou ntr ies such as 
Greece and Brazil, and historically, as in 
Nazi Germany, it always begins with the 
" radicals" - but soon it steamrolls, it gets 
out of control-soon it comes to include 
any and all who come into disfavor in the 
eyes of the established order . 

Now who are those seen as the 

malcontents in modern America? The 
learest indication as to where , 

ultimately, this all could end can be 
found in Ri chard Nixon's published list of 
political enemies Only very few on that 
list could be considered radicals The 
great majority of those enemies on 
Nixon's published list are peace ad-
vocates, Civil rights leaders, noted 
journalists, Democrats of all political 
shades, and even dissident Republicans . 

For American citizens to accept the 
Friday Evening War as a legitimate and 
reasonable method of law enforcement is 
for us to condone and to promote the 
development of a police state in 
America .

Freedom Threat

the success of the ideology, little 
realizing the delusion until it is too late. 

When the inhabitants of the Animal 
Farm finally realize their enslavement to 
Napolean tbe pig, it is too late to escape. 
Freedom from man has been achieved, 
yet the price has been enslavement first 
to an Ideology and then to a pig who can 
only proceed to distort that reality for his 
own good 

In the sam manner, the "blind 
obedients", w.ho cavort around UCSD 
preaching Marx or any other philosophy 
in the myriad of " lights", would proceed 
to struggl for their success. enslaving 
themselve to the telos of victory until 
that enslavement becomes complete and 
Inescapable. 

Hence. the obeisance of both the 
"don't cares" and the "blind obedlents" 
to their respective false seCUrities or 
subjective beliefs becomes the very 
foundation for the destruction of our 
freedom In hort,' through our present 
se lf-deceptions of numerous sorts, we 
have become our own greatest threat to 
freedom Watergate and our other 
societal ills may Indeed be symbolic as 
threats to our freedom, but e senti ally, 
the greatest threat is not in Washington 
or in the Imp rial Valley etc , but right 
here at UCSD Within ach and everyone 
of us. 

Riahts And Duties 
But fortunately, just as all of us 

represent at this juncture in .time the 
greatest enemies of our own freedom , we 
also represent the greatest friends of its 
retention . However, we cannot succeed 
in retaining our freedom by merely 
wi lling ourselves to become free . It is 
essential, and it is our duty as Citizens a 
well as human beings to act to retain our 
freedom . It is often said that freedom is 
the most inal ienable of right , yet 
ironically we must always fight to 

. maintain this inalienable right 

ANOTHER SUMMER OF FUN 

To those who are not leaVing UCSD 
next week, you must light by not blindly 
;H I f'ntlng any notion at all , be it material 
or ideological. Question and analyze all 
that appears before you , and only after 
you complete this process should you 
accept anything at all For only In an 
environment of constant questioning ca n 
"the search for knowledge" b uccessful 
in ItS quest And then It IS Important to 
remember that thiS earch n ver ends 

For those of you who arp leaVing 
UCSD, myself Included, It IS time to 
apply thiS kn')wledge I'.e have acqUired 
towards the eternal enhancement o f 
knowledge. sppclflcally towards those 
facets of our so lety that each of u~ ma.., 
perceive as ItS ill We mu t se k those 
professions where we ran best con trlbutt:' 
to the fulfillment of the Idpals of our 
forefathers while maintaining our 
freedom and ass I st I ng to r taln freedom 
for all people It would be Criminal on 
our part to guard our knol'.ledge selfishly 
or to take a cynical view towards that 
education which we have worked so hard 
to achieve But It would also b Criminal 
to apply that knowledge towards a 
furtherance of our "perpetual possession 
of being well decei ved " Just as we havp 
an Inalienable right to freedom, 'We have 
an Inalienable duty to maintain our 
freedom and the freedom of others, and 
we mu t be f'ver wary that our att mpts 
do not become the misguided delUSions 
of our subjective realities . 

The final paragraph of Aldous Huxley's 
Brave New World ReVisited statp 
"Meanwhile there IS till some frepdom 
left in the world . Many young people . It 
is true do not seem to value freedom 
But so~e of us still believe thdt , Without 
fr edom, human beings cannot become 
fully human ano that freedom IS 
therefore supremely valuabl Perhaps 
the forces that now menace freedom are 
too strong to be reSisted for very long It 
IS still our duty to do whate er \\e ca n to 
resist them ,-

economy. Similarly. "rape" 
cannot be understood 
without some knowledge of 
how sexism contributes to 
the degradation of women . 
The disproportionate use of 
heroin in Third World 
communities cannot be 
examined without per-
ceiving how racism creates 
the conditions for such 
behavior. 

Criminology cannot 
fulfill its responsibility 
unless it examines not only 
the "crimes" of the poor 
and Third World people 
who fill the jails and prisons 
but also the activities of the 
wealthy and privileged who 
either are beyond in-
crimination under the 
present system or use the 

Philip Praller 

law to protect their profits. 
It IS clear that the people 

who are opposed to the 
School-- the Regents . 
Chancellor Bowker. and the 
Sindler Committeec- are the 
ones who regard the 
university as a place to do 
research for profit. and to 
put "sc ience" at the service 
of the powerful. and to 
indoctrinate students into 
conform ity and sub-
missiveness . 

The tight to defend the 
present School of 
Criminology. therefore, 
cannot be waged as an 
isolated struggle apart from 
other struggles on the 
campus. It involves prin-
Ciples of self-determination, 
academic freedom and 
social justice, which aHects 
the rights and dignity of all 
students and workers on 
campus.

resultrnl In undeniable periods of excess ... Inst lan-
dlords, but multinl alto in a revolution that has ended 
with the, Chinese people well-fed (a tremendous 
achievement in the Third Worldl), well-housed, and In 

. some control of their own ~iny. 

.. ' Gandhi, In contrast; with his IdeoIotv of nonviolence 
chose not to "nceied proper. Iimits.H He chose ~o 

.' contal .. and to pacify the enefl/ft .of the people. As I ' 
result, WI'Onp haw not been riJhted. In India today, In 

. spite of its reputation as a democr.ic · stile with a 
nonviolent culture. there ant some 40,000· political 
prisoners who have experienced the beat1ncs, reptnp. 
electric shock torture we have hNrd ~ in the jails of 
South Vietnam and Brazil. Landless qrtculturallaborers 
have been burned alive In their huts by landlords for 
tryinl to oraanize unions, and the courts have set those 
landlords free. Hundred have been killed in food riots 
this very vear in the states of Bihar and Cu;arat . The 
government recentlv has been able to break a massive 
railroad strike only through the arrests and in-
discriminate beatings of some 15,000 militant workers 
and union leaders. And anyone 'who has been aware of 
recent newspaper reports and TV coverage of on-going 
and impending famine situations may ' realize fhal 
millions in India face starvation in the next decade-
because the landlord and rich-peasant dominated 
agriculture of India is not able to produce the food to 
feed its people even with grain and vegetables . All of 
this can be documented and it is a consequence of an 
incompleted national revolution. it is in this context 
that we have to understand the social functions of 
nonviolence. 

Finally : for the Triton Times to print such a mass of 
diatribe and slanderous inaccuracies as Mr. Eckhoff's 
article in an editorial slot shows its irresponsibility in 
dealing with the real agony facing the countries of Asia. 
Africa and Latin America, and the rising revolutionary 
responses of their peoples.

How Roots give your feet 
I a good feeling, 

then send it up your spine. 
Sport Root in leather 
(New Earth); suede Open Root in leath (New Complete Details 
(Sahara) 

To see the idea behind Roots, take a 
side-view look at the shoe. Instead of a 
heel to lift you up and tilt you forward, 
you'll find a one·piece base to plant 
you finnly in touch with Mother Earth. 
Roots, you see, work very much like 
roots. And if you take a side-view look 
at the human foot , you'll see why they 
work as well as they do. Your heel is the 
lowest part of your foot, so in Roots 
it sits in the lowest part of your shoe. 

Suddenly you stand straighter as 
additional muscles in the back of your 
legs and the small of your back spring 
to life to help hold you up and move 
you around. Now consider that recess 
in your sole called the arch. If you 
spend a good deal of time on your feet, 
unsupported arches can sag and may 
fall out of shape altogether. (This is 
why in those pre·cruiser days a police· 
man was known as a flatfoot.) To help 
prevent your arches from falling, Roots 
are contoured to support them. There's 
a smaller recess between the balls of 
your feet which Roots will take care 
of as well.

... , tb:k, nooh 01 w,w.,. Blvd 

Earth. White); suede 
(Sahara. Blue) 

Near the front , you'll notice the sole 
is curved like a rocker. In normal walk-
ing, your weight lands first on your 
heel, shifts along the outer side of your 
foot, then diagonally across to your big 
toe which springs you off on your next 
step. The rocker idea simply makes 
that transfer of weight a little eaSier, 
which makes each step a little less tiring. 

All told, Roots bring a good, natural 
feeling to man's somewhat un ·natural 
custom of treading hard floors and city 
sidewalks. Roots are designed and 
made in Canada; and at the heart of 
our production are two generations of 
cobblers (a father and three sons) who 
ding to the premise that good quality 
footwear must still be made largely by 
hand . The way we feel about making 
Roots has a lot to do with the way 
you'll feel wearing them.
