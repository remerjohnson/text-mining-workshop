On Sept. 6, UCSD Housing, Dining and Hospitality announced on Facebook 
that they are turning the Marshall 
College dining hall, OceanView 
Terrace (OVT), into an all-you-can-
eat buffet. Patrons will pay a single 
price at the door instead of paying 
per item, as they could before which 
is still the case at the other dining 
halls. 

The price varies for breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. Breakfast is $7.95, 
lunch is $8.95 and dinner is $10.95. 
While bottled sodas will not be 
included in the price, water will 
remain free. The coffee station has 

been removed, but there will still be 
access to regular coffee and ice cream. 
On some nights, OVT will serve 
special menus that will cost $13.95.

“It’s good for guys,” Marshall 
College senior Kevin Chang said. “I 

think it’s way better because a meal is 
usually over $13.”

Along with the change in pricing 
comes an alteration to the hours. 
OVT will now be closed between 
meal periods to give workers time to 

set up for the next meal. Breakfast 
will be from 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. 
Lunch will be served between the 
hours of 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. 
Dinner will be open from 5 p.m. to 9  
p.m. Monday through Thursday and 

5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Fridays.
OVT was open during move-in 

this past weekend, but OVT will no 
longer remain open on weekends.

Many of the changes in the menu 
are in response to the all-you-can-
eat format change. Portion sizes 
will be slightly smaller — the deli is 
cutting long sandwiches into smaller 
helpings.

Students who are not planning 
to eat at the dining hall will not be 
allowed to enter and sit with their 
friends, nor will they be allowed to 
re-enter the dining hall after leaving. 

Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
announced in messages to new 
residents that the need for the dish 
drop-off locations, Toby Spots, have 
been replaced. Students will no 
longer be allowed to take dishes out. 
Instead, they will be given recyclable 
containers for leftover food.

HDH Executive Director Mark 
Cunningham could not be reached for 
comment by press time.

*Editor’s Note: Zev Hurwitz was 
included in the UC President’s Advisory 
Council on Campus Climate, Culture 
and Inclusion interview process. He sup-
plied feedback that was used in the 
report. 

The University of California will not 
enforce a controversial “complete ban” 
on hate speech, according to according 

to UC President Mark G. Yudof.  The 
ban had been a recommendation of 
the UC President’s Advisory Council 
on Campus Climate, Culture and 
Inclusion, which Yudof had deployed 
to survey the needs of Jewish and 
Muslim students on UC cam-
puses in reaction to past con-
frontations.

In an exclusive phone inter-
view with The Guardian and 
other UC campus press, Yudof 
said that a ban that prevented 
students from demonstrating 
beliefs would be impossible.

“If by hate-free [campus], you mean 
people cannot speak out what they 
think about other people or events or 
whatever, and it’s simply pure [free] 

speech, we can’t do it.” Yudof said in a 
Sept. 19 phone interview. “We protect 
speech in this country, that’s what our 
First Amendment is all about.”

Yudof had commissioned the 
Advisory Council on 
Campus Climate, Culture and 
Inclusion in 2011 to assess the 
feelings of Jewish, Arab and 
Muslim students to improve 
those students’ campus expe-
rience.

Between October 2011 
and 2012, the council trav-
elled in two teams to inter-

view students on multiple campuses 
and, in July, released its findings in

The electrical and computer engi-

two separate reports — one for Jewish 
students and the other for Arab and 
Muslim students.

Suggestions in the Jewish report 
included suggestions advising that 
UC “adopt a hate speech-free campus 
policy.” This would mean that events 
such as the annual “Justice in Palestine 
Week” and other events that contain 
anti-Israel elements or would not be 
tolerated on campuses. 

The report’s authors, San Diego 
attorney Rick Barton — who is the 
national education chair for the 
Anti-Defamation League — and 
Alice Huffman, the President of 
California National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People 
(NAACP), included the ban with other 
recommendations such as encourag-
ing the UC campuses to increase edu-
cation about anti-Semitism and have 
more kosher food options available.

The report on Arab and Muslim 
students included recommendations 
such as increasing the availability of 
Islamic studies academic opportu-
nities, increasing the availability of 
halal food, and ensuring that Muslim 
students have a sufficient number of 
places to pray.

Since August, two separate online 
petitions, respectively urging UC to 
accept and reject the Jewish report’s 
hate speech recommendation,   have 
collected thousands  of signatures. The 
petition against the recommendation 
cited First Amendment concerns.

“In short, the report distorts cam-
pus life, and its recommendations 
threaten free speech on campuses,” the 
petition on change.org said.

Yudof said that his office was 
already taking steps to address some 
of the recommendations, such as the 
request for more places for Muslim 
students to hold prayer services—
though none of the recommendations, 

including the hate speech ban, will be 
coming to any sort of vote.

“There’s been a lot of misinforma-
tion about that. These sets of recom-
mendations are not coming to a vote 
in the campus climate committee,” he 
said. “These are reports that I commis-
sioned to advise me and my staff and 
I will be wading through them to see 
what makes sense.”

This is not the first time that a hate 
speech ban has been proposed for 
UC campuses. Following the infamous 
“Compton Cookout” incident in 2010, 
the Black Student Union BSU advo-
cated for a similar ban and worked 
with the 10-campus representative UC 
Student Association to have the UC 
regents adopt it. While no formal ban 
was enacted, a federal investigation led 
to the April 2012 opening of the UCSD 
Office of Prevention of Harassment 
and Discrimination which was cre-
ated to prevent similar incidents from 
occurring.

In 2010, a Facebook event page for 
a racially-driven party, dubbed “The 
Compton Cookout” sparked a series 
of racially-charged incidents around 
campus, including a noose that was left 
hanging in Geisel Library.

The release of the two reports in 
July is not the end of the UC Office 
of the President assessing campus cli-
mates. On Sept. 18, UCOP announced 
the launch of a new online system-
wide survey that will be made available 
to all students during this academic 
year and will assess general campus 
climate. Yudof stressed the need for 
UC students to respond to the upcom-
ing survey. “It’s hard to know what 
students really think. We need to get 
at least 30 percent [of students] to 
participate to have a balanced report. 
I’m hoping it will lead to more intel-
ligent policy.”

graduate with electrical engineering 
degrees but end up in alternative 
jobs, such as law or politics. Paul 
Yu, now UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Research Initiatives, said the major 
created for students who want to 
learn the basic and practical training 
of electrical engineering, but who are 
leaning toward a degree in the social 
sciences or humanities.

“Many people have their mind set 
to do electrical engineering, except 
some of them may still try to think 
about if they have made the right 
choice when they decided to go into 
engineering,” Yu said in an interview. 
“We want to cater to their interests 
to formulate a major that satisfies 
the majority of electrical engineer-
ing with something that is broader 
than a minor — social sciences and 
humanities.”

The electrical engineering and 
society major covers the majority 
of electrical engineering classes, in 
addition to 24 units of upper divi-
sion classes in social sciences and 
humanities; their class options range 
from history to economics to sociol-
ogy. One of the last classes students 
are required to take is a electrical 

engineering design course to com-
bine their knowledge. 

 “A student will learn a lot about 
electrical engineering, and they will 
be able to go to a master program in 
engineering should they decide to,” 
Yu said. “This program gives suffi-
cient background for [the students.]”

As of now, only three students 
have electrical engineering and soci-
ety as a major — and the number 
changes every quarter. Usually, stu-
dents drop the major. Two students 
are starting to take classes for the 
major this fall.

“About one to three students every 
quarter declare EE & Society as their 
major but unfortunately no one has 
ever graduated with that major,” 
Electrical and Computer Engineering 
Advisor Myda Prado said in an email.

Only one of the original three stu-
dents who began the major in 2010 
is still pursuing it and is on track to 
graduate this spring with a double 
major in electrical engineering and 
society and economics. 

Yu was the Chair for the 
Electrical and Computer Engineering 
Department from 2003-07. He said 
he came up with the background 
for the new major with the help of 
former Professor Ed Yu, his daughter 

Lea, and the undergraduate engineer-
ing programs at Harvard and Yale 
Universities.

Yu turned in the proposal with 
endorsements from the Council of 
Provosts and from the History and 
Economics departments in early 
2007. He stepped down from his chair 
position later that year, and the Vice 
Chair of Undergraduate Education 
George Papen and the new Chair of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering 
Larry Larson helped Yu submit the 
final version of the proposal to the 
Academic Senate Committee on 
Educational Policies. It was approved 
in July of 2008 and three incoming 
freshmen were the first students to 
choose the major in 2010.

This is not the Jacob’s School of 
Engineering’s only fusion of differ-
ent disciplines. The new Structural 
and Materials Engineering Building 
was built with the intention of mix-
ing engineering with art. The new 
building houses the departments 
of Structural Engineering and 
Nanoengineering and shares the 
space with Visual Arts. The building 
opened Sept. 14.

CAMPUS — This year’s freshman 
class will be the first to enjoy four 
years of guaranteed on-campus hous-
ing. According to UCSD Marketing 
and Media Relations Assistant 
Manager Christine Clark, UCSD is 

the first campus in the UC system 
to ensure 12 consecutive quarters of 
on-campus living. A record 12,574 
students are living in over 400 on-
campus buildings this fall.

Last year, students who chose to 
live on campus were only guaranteed 
3 years of consecutive housing. Before 
2011 students were only guaranteed 
2 years.

Additionally, all incoming trans-
fers are guaranteed two years of on-

the UCSd Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San diego. Contents © 2012. 
Views expressed herein represent the majority vote of the

Board of regents, the aSUCSd or the members of the 

Guardian staff. 

To UC San Diego’s incoming students, Welcome. We’re so glad you made it. And you have, indeed, made it. 
If our own experiences are anything to go by, you 

have spent the past 18 years of your life working up 
to this point, spending an alarming amount of time 
on Advanced Placement courses, marching band and 
volunteer excursions into Malawi. And then, flush 
with credits and excitement, you chose UC San Diego 
over all other esteemed institutions (it’s OK, we didn’t 
get into UCLA or Cal either). This school may not 
have been your first choice, but aside from occasional 
awkward family gatherings, it hardly matters anymore. 
You are the one who can make your college experience 
count, and believe us, you’ll have many opportunities.

You’ve heard a great deal, we presume, about the 
campus. From the 3-D glasses and YOLO-themed 
acceptance packet, you learned that UC San Diego is 

Disneyland. From current students, you learned that 
“SD” stands for socially dead and that choosing Revelle 
College as a humanities major is a terrible decision. Or 
perhaps you learned that too late. 

But what you should know, beyond the U.S. News 
and World rankings, beyond the press clippings, good 
and bad, is that this is your college experience — your 
chronicle of higher education. Away from the judging 
eyes of your parents, nobody here will push you into an 
internship because it will be good for your career pros-
pects. Nobody is even going to push you to study. Your 
successes and follies are all your own, so embrace it. 

It is entirely possible to spend your time here jug-
gling two classes (unless you are on financial aid) and a 
League of Legends addiction. It is also entirely possible 
to drink your way out of college in the first quarter.

Welcome to the Jungle
It’s the start of  a new year, and for the freshman, a whole new chapter. It is easy to get lost in the 

eucalyptus trees, but your experience at UCSD is in your own hands.

In elementary school,  someone told me that if my hand was bigger than my face, I had cancer. 
Falling prey to this line is akin to 
excessively heeding the “experts” who 
report that all things good and normal 
in this world are potential cancer 
hazards. You’re just setting yourself up 
for lavish panic attacks.

According to the Sept. 5 Huffington 
Post article “Bubble Tea Tapioca 
Pearls May Contain Cancer-Causing 

Chemicals, German Study Claims,” 
the folks at the University Hospital 
Aachen have found that boba may 
contain the carcinogen PCB. As an 
addict who gets antsy without boba for 
more than 48 hours (I’m giving myself 
too much credit — the number hovers 
closer to 4.8), this should worry me. 
But it doesn’t.

We live in an age in which 
everything appears to be cause for 
alarm. Talking on cell phones for 
too long may increase your risk of 
brain cancer. French fries, potato 
chips, cereal and coffee contain the 
cancer-inducing chemical acrylamide. 
Plastic shower curtains are hotbeds 
for chemicals correlated with liver and 
nervous system damage as well as — 
you guessed it — cancer.

And the list doesn’t end there. 
New car interiors. Plane rides. Hair 
dye. Anti-perspirant. You can’t even 
sit at home in peace. Apparently, the 
radioactive gas radon is produced 
from the natural decay of uranium 
in soil, which sneaks its way through 
cracks in your house and can cause 
lung cancer. Researchers seem to be 
nodding in fervent agreement with 
Hobbes’ pessimistic assertion that life 
is “nasty, brutish and short.”

Yet, I really don’t care. It’s mentally 
taxing to keep tabs on everything that 
is supposedly killing you. By nature, 
people find comfort in dismissing 
challenges to the familiar. And 
maybe I’m choosing to be ignorant. 
But if I were to listen to everything 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and every other researcher 
out there said, the only “safe” way to 
live would be to become a paranoid 
recluse like Leonardo DiCaprio’s 
character at the end of “The Aviator.” 
I have enough neurotic tendencies as 
it is. The bottom line is, I don’t smoke; 
I am nowhere near obese; I put on a 
decent amount of sunscreen before 
exiting the house every day. Tackling 
the obvious should be enough for any 
normal human being.

The public doesn’t need to be 
ferried along with every “breakthrough 
discovery” that comes out. I would 
not even pause mid-chew if an article 
popped up tomorrow about a possible 
correlation between hand-to-face size 
ratio and your chances of contracting 
cancer. Obsessing over speculative 
causes of cancer is useless (and has 
been reported by one study to increase 
your risk of cancer too, incidentally).

In short — science can suck it. I 
will still be getting my regular fix of 
almond boba milk tea, regardless of 
what the German scientists say.

Ways of the World
•	 Don’t walk around in packs of eight or more with lanyards around your neck. 

It automatically pegs you as a first-year, and though nobody will dump spoiled 
milk on your head in a misguided hazing ritual, it just makes us groan. 

•	 Go to the gym. You’re already paying for gym fees, so at least walk over to 
RIMAC (and Muir college’s decidedly less crowded Main Gym) sometime and 
check it out. If the weight room isn’t for you, the squash courts are pretty fun 
(and competitive). 

•	 Get your bus sticker as soon as possible. Take the 41 to Fashion Valley Mall. 
Take the 30 to Pacific Beach or downtown. Don’t miss out on San Diego just 
because you are stuck in La Jolla. 

•	 CAPS, UCSD’s counseling and psychological services are free. Believe us, col-
lege life will begin to take a toll at some point, whether it’s because of grades 
or relationships or suitemates from hell, and it will be nice to talk to somebody 
who is professionally required to listen to you.

•	 It has been said that UCSD’s college system was created to stop students from 
gathering in a central location (and that Geisel Library is the definition of pan-
opticism). Don’t let that stop you from meeting new friends in Sixth College, 
even though you’re not quite sure where their dorms even are. 

•	 Have fun. Your classes, internship, part-time job and our advice may only serve 
to impede your “crazy college years” but really, by all means, partake in the 
festivities. Befriend absolutely (Absolut) everyone. And try not to puke on the 
second floor of the Old Student Center. 

•	 Our plug: The Guardian is UC San Diego’s official student-run newspaper. 
We were founded in 1967 and currently print twice weekly, on Mondays and 
Thursdays. Our staff is ever changing (we blame the fact that it’s a newspaper 
at a four-year university), so we encourage you to grab life by the horns and 
apply. You might find that chasing after a story with a notebook and recorder is 
just your thing.

leTTeRS TO THe ediTOR

Dear Editor,
I have heard about UCSD’s new 

“eco-friendly buses” though the 
article in the Guardian “Despite 
previous budget concerns, UCSD 
unveils five environmentally friendly 
shuttles.” 

However, I am concerned at just 
how eco-friendly they are. These 
new buses are CNG (compressed 
natural gas) buses. 

I applaud the effort to reduce 
carbon emissions. I am all for 
reducing our dependence on foreign 
fossil fuels in exchange for local 
made green fuels, yet is natural gas 
the best option?

I think not. I am much more 
enthusiastic about biofuels that do 
not release carbon into the air at all 
and fuel that does not destroy the 
environment upon its extraction 
from the earth. 

I also am not excited about the 
use of transportation money for 
buying more new vehicles that still 
emit carbon. 

If we are going to buy buses, why 
only go part way when we could buy 
electric shuttle buses or any other 
carbon-neutral option.

One very feasible option would 
be retrofitting diesel buses, just as 
UCSD has done with the Greenline 
Shuttle, making it run on 100 
percent biodiesel. UC Irvine has also 
started retrofitting their buses. 

The process of converting to 
biodiesel extends the life of the diesel 
buses. 

In other words, we can use the 
buses we already have and not buy 
new ones. That is innovation.

Dear Editor, 
I am writing this letter to talk 

about an environmental issue that 
I feel is very important to our 
communities, especially as students 
at UCSD.

This issue is about pollution in 
our oceans and more importantly, the 
way that we are not sustainable with 
the water that we use on campus. 
I have heard a lot of students who 
take long showers do not turn off 
the water while brushing their teeth 
or shaving, and simply waste more 
water than needed since according to 
them, “they’re not paying for it.” 

UCSD has ranked the no. 1 
school for being sustainable because 
we have these new high tech, brand 
new solar paneled trash and recycling 
bins, but the amount of water we 
waste is ridiculous. There are even 
sprinklers that are broken and so 
waste gallons of water every night, 
but nothing is being done to fix 
them. It’s understandable that change 
cannot happen overnight but we 
also need to take into account that 
one, we are paying for the water 
through students fees, and two, the 
environment and all its inhabitants 
pay for it as well.

Instead, take a different path and 
broaden your mind — you may just 
be another engineering student, but 
that hardly means you have to lock 
yourself in the library. 

Seek out groups of interesting 
people, as we did. The members of 
this editorial board have all spent 
the better part of their college 
careers in student journalism, but 
we all have different interests, and 
consequently taken different paths. 

Our opinion editor joined Greek 
life her first week at UC San Diego 
and is now an active member of 

Chi Omega. Our associate opinion 
editor, combining her affinity for 
biological sciences and writing, 
joined Saltman Quarterly, an under-
graduate biological research journal. 
Our venerable editor in chief used 
her opportunities at the paper to 
take trips to Israel and Tennessee to 
learn more about digital media and 
reporting.

So go Greek, or join the 
Quidditch club. Read the paper. Take 
a glassblowing class at the crafts cen-
ter. Try Hare Krishna (Old Student 
Center, Wednesdays) at least once. 
Again, read the paper. Trust your 

instincts, keep your wits about you 
and never let first impressions guide 
your judgement. 

But remember, above all, that col-
lege is not a four-year waiting room 
before you start the rest of your life. 
Many graduates cross the stage with 
no conception of future plans and a 
bare-bones resume, but we don’t rec-
ommend it. Find your purpose here, 
or at the very least, a profession. Get 
an internship, work in a lab, befriend 
a professor. Keep up your contacts, 
because they will be valuable in the 
future. And if all else fails, learn 
another language.

GoinG 
Greek

studEnt LiFE

Joining a fraternity or sorority isn’t 
right for everybody but for many, going 
Greek may be a perfect fit. 
BY LaIRa MaRTIN • LIfeSTYLe  eDIToR

L ast year I dabbled in online dating and wrote the daunt-ing details for you in a column 
called “This Modern Love.” I now 
sit in the Living Room Coffee Shop 

in La Jolla — where I went on a 
handful of mediocre dates not too 
long ago — thinking about what’s in 
store for my peers and I this coming 
school year. I’ve never been one for 
setting New Year’s resolutions sim-
ply because Jan. 1 never really felt 
like the start of a new year to me. 
Being on a traditional school system 
for my whole life meant that any 
indicator of a fresh start came in 
September, and that hasn’t changed. 

September means a lot of 
things. In the fashion world, 
September indicates a new year 
in clothes. After a long summer 
in the Hamptons or somewhere 
less glamorous, people return to 
their jobs and hometowns to a 
new year in business, triggering 
new trends, fashion week and the 
fattest September issue of Vogue 
you’ve ever seen. Not everyone can 
relate to fashion necessarily but this 
way of looking at things perfectly 
coincides with those of us who are 
in school and those of us who see 
September as a fresh start. 

For me, September means a 
new school year, a new apartment 
and maybe new romantic ventures 
(or if I don’t keep my head on my 
shoulders, it may also mean the 
rehashing of old romantic ventures). 
It also means the reemergence of 
my column — a personal evalua-
tion of what it’s like to be young and 
single in the 21st century and all the 
complications that can come with 
that.  But that’s why I’m making 
resolutions, to counteract anything 
misguided I’m known to do. So I 
propose we drop the whole January 
thing and evaluate our lives based 
on the schedules we already so dili-
gently keep. For me this will be the 
second-to-last time I’ll make a new 
school year resolution because soon 
enough I’ll graduate and have to 
concede to society’s schedule. 

Here’s what I came up with. 1.) 
I’ll be more open to social oppor-
tunities. Not being in the mood is 
not a valid reason to pass up a great 
night out with new friends. 2.) I’ll 
play less games with guys. If I like 
someone, I’ll try to be direct instead 
of my usual passive self. 3.) I’ll think 
before I text. I don’t think that needs 
to be explained. 4.) I’ll cut down on 
Facebook stalking the opposite sex, 
a practice my friends and I are quite 
familiar with. I want people to still 
seem like people to me, not profiles. 
Love is something that is often 
shaped by the time period. Whether 
that’s “Love in the Time of Cholera” 
or love in the time of texting, I 
think it’s important to periodically 
evaluate our thought process on 
the subject and really think about if 
we’re doing things in the best way. 

Of course keeping a journal is 
one way to express my thoughts 
on this subject but by periodi-
cally evaluating where my love 
life stands every few weeks in the 
form of a column, I can do just that 
while also thinking about issues 
that affect all of us here at UCSD. 
Putting my life on blast to an odd 
26,000 people is much more cathar-
tic anyway. Stay tuned for the next 
installment where slut jars meet 
feminism. Don’t worry, I’m as con-
fused as you are.

    This Modern
 Love

Remember, 
Remember 
the First of  
September

In your first few days of the new academic year, there are many 
decisions to make. OVT 
or Pines for lunch? UCSD 
Bookstore or Amazon? 
And the question that 
will seem most pressing 
while walking down 
Library Walk — to go 
Greek or not? 

Choosing to rush a 
fraternity or sorority 
is a decision that will 
inevitably affect your 

college experience. And 
whether you need to 
make this decision as a 
freshman or if you’re an 
upperclassman looking 
for more out of your 
college years, there are a 
few things to know about 
the process and what to 
expect. That’s why the 
Guardian sat down with 
several campus Greek 
leaders on campus to 
see what they had to say 
about the process. 

RUSHINg a fRaT RUSHINg a SoRoRITY

Fraternity rush is notorious 
for being very laid-back at UCSD. 
Unlike sororities, Frats don’t sing 
songs at their rush events, don’t 
wear matching outfits and they 
don’t hand you mocktails. Unlike 
formal sorority rush, fraterni-
ties hold informal recruitment 
events like broom ball games or 
pizza at Round Table. UCSD’s 
Interfraternity Council (IFC) 
President Chris Chang explained 
that rushing a frat can be a great 
experience regardless of whether 
you decide to ultimately join.

“Rush week is the most fun 
because you just go out and meet 
different fraternities,” Chang said. 
“You get free stuff and free food. 
You talk about life and your goals in 
college.” 

After attending a few events, 
rushees can decide which frats they 
like the most and commit more 
time to their events. Chang explains 

that it’s a mutual selection process 
between the fraternity and the 
rushee, which is designed to create 
the best match. 

“I truly think there is a fraternity 
for everyone,” Chang said. “That’s 
the whole point of having 13 dif-
ferent fraternities. We don’t want a 
cookie cutter mold for every single 
one of our members.”

The IFC president understands 
that Greek life isn’t for everyone, but 
encourages campus involvement for 
all students. 

“What’s the worst thing that 
could happen?” Chang said. “You 
realize ‘Oh, I didn’t want to spend 
that half hour eating free food or 
meeting new people.’ Be part of 
our community because too many 
people sit at home because they’re 
not involved. You don’t want to 
spend four years of your life paying 
this much money to not get the most 
out of it.” 

DRINkINg

Choosing whether to drink alco-
hol is something all college students 
face. And although alcohol may be 
accessible in many different situa-
tions on campus, greek life is most 
often associated with parties. At the 
end of the day choosing to drink is 
the choice of the individual but going 
greek may create more opportunities 
for alcohol consumption. 

“Incoming greeks have to take 
an alcohol abuse class,’ Chang said. 
“ I actually think it’s a good thing 
because a lot of freshman come 
in with an excuse to just go crazy 
because they’ve never been able to 
[drink] before and I think greeks have 

seen a lot. So I think freshman are in 
good hands [with greeks.]” 

But Chang foresees eventual 
change in the greek system. 

“A lot of our fraternities are start-
ing to realize that the old model is 
not working and that the old model 
is inviting girls over and partying,” 
he said. “The whole culture of binge 
drinking and hazing is kind of the 
lazy way of doing things.”

Regardless, knowing your limit 
when it comes to alcohol is an impor-
tant skill to have because temptations 
are likely to present themselves in the 
form of a red cup during your time 
here at UCSD. 

HazINg

Hazing for the sake of bonding 
is often associated with Greek life. 
Whether hazing actually occurs 
in Greek life or within other 
organizations is, well, hazy. It’s 
something people will not admit 
to or condone — what goes behind 
closed doors remains a mystery. 
What we do know is that Greek 
organizations and leaders officially 
forbid hazing, and if an incident 
surfaces, the organization can face a 
lot of trouble. 

“Fraternities are not allowed to 
haze and I would see no benefit try-
ing to instill certain beliefs [through 
hazing],” Sigma Phi Epsilon 
Chapter President Allan Cortes 
said. “I think a fraternity should 
aim toward developing a member 
right from the beginning he joins 

until he graduates.” Chang pointed 
out that although hazing may exist 
at other universities, UCSD and 
IFC have very strict rules concern-
ing hazing.

“Greeks obviously go hand-in- 
hand with hazing because of the 
stereotypes, and occasionally an 
article pops up about an incident,” 
Chang said. “We have a no-hazing 
policy and if IFC were to find out 
about it, the chapter would be 
immediately suspended and their 
nationals would be contacted. 
Basically, the house would collapse.” 

People put into what seems to 
be a forced, uncomfortable activ-
ity have every right to refuse and 
report the incident whether it 
occurs within Greek life, or in any 
other organization on campus. 

Unlike the laid-back approach 
of fraternities, sorority recruitment 
is high-energy, high-stress and all-
around chaotic. Whether you’re 
rushing freshman or senior year, 
this process is inevitably going to 
be intimidating because rushees are 
often given little to no insight into 
the rush process prior to entering 
their first “party.” 

Parties last anywhere from 
about 20 to 90 minutes, and each 
rushee will attend nine on the first 
day of visiting every UCSD chapter. 
As you realize which chapters you 
like and which chapters like you, 
the number of parties you attend 
each day will decrease until you are 
left with a bid from the sorority you 
can soon call home. 

It’s clear that the girls behind 

recruitment put a lot of time and 
effort towards this process and 
they seem to have it down pat, but 
that doesn’t mean their singing 
and dancing won’t initially scare 
you. They’ll show you slide shows. 
They’ll snap a lot. But at the end 
of the day they’ll want to know 
more about you so that every girl 
finds the chapter that suits them 
best. If you’re on the edge about 
rushing the best way to figure out 
if it’s right for you is to go through 
recruitment because there is no 
greater indicator that you’ll enjoy 
sorority life than if you can make 
it through the week- long process. 
And if you don’t like it, there’s no 
harm in dropping out and find-
ing other extracurriculars. You 
wouldn’t be the first girl to do so.

I n the spring of 1990, the virus was still practically undetectable. Gossiping housewives, stoners and 
channel-flippers of all creeds and 
color tuned in to the familiar soap 

opera schtick: A beautiful homecom-
ing queen’s body is found in a small 
town, the small town is shocked, an 
investigation begins, everyone’s a 
suspect, drama ensues, etc. 

Then, things began to change. 
Granted, David Lynch’s “Twin 

Peaks” was radical from its surreal 
opening seconds: a dream-like mon-
tage of rusted lumber saws being 
sharpened, the steady flow of opaque 
brown water, titles appearing in 
some batshit font — letters outlined 
in neon green and filled with a dull 
brown, creating a sort of unfocusable 
optical illusion — all set to the hazy 
and hollow late-’80s theme music of 
Angelo Badalamenti. 

Yet, to the untrained eye, the true 
nature of this infected soap didn’t 
become clear until Lynch really 
pulled the rug out from under-
neath. Haunting images outstayed 
their typically allotted welcome. 
Characters’ fears and fever dreams 
were at times almost unbearably

“The Haunted House,” 1908,

“Horror has been a staple of

also been a breeding ground for 
innovation in camera tricks and 

techniques. This film is a great 
example of that.”

“Un chien andalou,” 1929,

“I chose for its artistic merits, 
as well as for its continued 

effectiveness.”

“Skeleton Frolic,” 1937, 
Ub iwerks

“I also decided to include 
[‘Skeleton Frolic’] to show how 
classically horrific images have 

long been used in more 
lighthearted fare.”

“The film gives a startlingly clear 

look at America in the ‘50s.”

“katasumi,” 1998,

“I chose this film to discuss the 
takeover of Japanese ghost stories 
that happened in the late 90s and 

early 2000s.”

“Treevenge,” 2008, 
Jason eisener

“This film is a great example of 
the ‘70s exploitation nostalgia that 

grips many of today’s young 
horror filmmakers.”

“Martin,” 1976, 
George a. romero

“This film is a reflection of the 
shift from supernatural horror, 

which was en vogue in early film, 
to the more realistic serial killer or 
‘slasher’ horror that became popu-

T he only letdown surrounding Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest epic “The Master,” occurred 
over a year ago when speculators first 
drew connections between the titular 
character’s 
fictional 
religious 
movement, 
“The Cause,” 
and L. Ron 
Hubbard’s 
Church of 
Scientology. 
Since then, well-known Scientologists 
have publicly denounced the film, 
pre-production was delayed time 
after time to the point where many 
wondered if “The Master” would ever 
see the light of a theatrical release and 
now many theater goers and critics 
alike will line up to take part in the 
no-holds-barred cinematic offensive 
that Scientologists have had coming 
for years. 

These people will be disappointed 
and quite possibly frustrated by “The 
Master.”

Of course, those connections were 
warranted. Fascinating scenes in the 
film depicting the inner workings 
of “The Cause” feature methods of 
desensitization uncannily identical 
to Scientology’s “processing.” But 
those who have fallen for Anderson’s 
immaculate characters and craft in 
the past might have guessed that 
calling “The Master” a film about 
Scientology would be like calling 
Anderson’s classic “Boogie Nights” a 

film about porn, or his most recent 
“There Will Be Blood” about oil. The 
subtext is far more complex.

The film follows a recent WWII 
navy veteran, Freddie Quell (Joaquin 
Phoenix), as he returns to the states 
in search of a job and a new life whilst 
coping with a post-trauma-related 
psychological illness. Whether you 
were a fan of Phoenix’s televised per-
formance piece/publicity stunt back in 
2010, you’d be hard pressed to argue 
that the actor lacks commitment. 
Here, in one of the most unhinged 
performances of the last decade, that 
commitment is more striking, and 
frightening, than ever. Quell is believ-
ably self-destructive, impulsive and 
broken. His obsessive nature redefines 
the word “sex-crazed” (a motif that 
burns far brighter throughout “The 
Master” than religion). He, like his 
country, is an open wound searching 
for answers. 

These answers come in the form 
of the eccentric Lancaster Dodd 
(an outstanding Philip Seymour 
Hoffman), who, after finding a stow-
away Quell on his yacht, describes 
himself as “a writer, a doctor, a 
nuclear physicist, a theoretical phi-
losopher, but above all … a man. A 
hopelessly inquisitive man.” In a fol-
lowing scene, Dodd charms a crowd 
of wedding guests with a likeable yet 
far from humble dissertation, and 
we finally see Quell begin to loosen, 
his demons temporarily subdued by 
Dodd’s words. 

The relationship between Dodd 

and Quell  — sidelined by one of Amy 
Adams’ greatest on-screen achieve-
ments as Dodd’s wife (and arguably 
“The Master’s’” true namesake, as 
a memorable “love” scene between 
her and Lancaster might indicate) 
— is squarely at the film’s core. And 
whether it is dominant-submissive, 
or even slightly homoerotic, it is a 
complicated one. In Dodd, Quell has 
found a light and a kindness. He’s 
also found a duty and an escape from 
the troubling realities of being left to 
his own devices. In Quell, Dodd has 
found a guinea pig and a rare kind of 
servant. Quite possibly, Dodd has also 
found his only true friend.

Though the film was shot on 
sumptuous 65mm, Anderson’s 
visual style is surprisingly  unassum-
ing. These scenes from a post-war 
America — the costumes, the props, 
the extras — comprise a detailed 
atmosphere, but Anderson seems less 
concerned than ever with dazzling the 
audience via striking diorama shot 
composition and camera movement. 

Even the much-anticipated score by 
“There Will Be Blood” collabora-
tor Johnny Greenwood (Radiohead) 
manages to stay out of the way, serv-
ing only to heighten the tension or 
ambiguity with the haunting turn of 
a melody. This film is about the char-
acters, and aptly enough we spend a 
great deal of time studying them in 
intimate close-up shots. A twitch, a 
tear, a quiver, a bead of sweat — all 
are riveting phenomena taking place 
on the facial landscapes of these out-
standing actors. 

Most refreshing, however, is the 
fact that Anderson has managed 
to pose even more questions, and 
answer less of them. All of his films 
have been steeped in human messi-
ness, but all have paid at least some 
consolation to the audience by wrap-
ping that mess in a ribbon during 
the final moments. “Boogie Nights”’ 
tracking-shot finale brought the band 
of misfits together as an imperfect but 
loving family. “There Will Be Blood” 
saw Daniel Plainview at his tragic 

end, alone and having destroyed 
everything around him. 

“The Master” doesn’t so much 
end, but dissipate into more ques-
tions. In a way, the relationship marks 
the peak and imminent downfall 
of Dodd’s reign. For Quell, oddly 
enough, the treatment sort of works 
— but only in a way that could’ve 
worked for someone with Quell’s 
particular afflictions. All the while, 
“The Cause” looms overhead — its 
presence troubling, but its direct con-
sequences unclear.  

The product is so unrelenting and 
real that, despite the film’s ambiguity, 
Anderson seems to have achieved 
a very particular goal. Rather than 
attack the institution directly, the 
filmmaker has turned a compas-
sionate eye to those standing in its 
shadow. It lends a better understand-
ing of the kinds of people and ideolo-
gies that might foster the existence 
of something like Scientology, and, 
indeed, a better understanding of 
human nature as well.

from what is considered ‘low 
brow’ art as we can from what 
is considered ‘high brow’ art,” 
Rodriguez, founder of San Diego’s 
Horrible Imaginings Film Festival, 
told the Guardian in an interview 
last week. “Since 
its inception, 
horror has been 
branded as base 
at best and perni-
cious at worst. I 
think it is impor-
tant to remember 
that art reflects 
elements of the 
human condition 
— not the other 
way around. We all have within us 
a dark side that horror of all types 
can explore in a variety of ways.”

In addition to Horrible 
Imaginings, a horror film festival 
that has traveled across Southern 
California, Rodriguez’s passion for 
excavating forgotten haunts and 
presenting them to like-minded 
audiences has manifested itself 
professionally in a weekly podcast 
entitled Monster Island Resort 
and a monthly film night at the 
Whistlestop Bar in South Park 
called Shot By Shot. This is no 
passing hobby for Rodriguez. His 
descent into cinema’s dark side 
began when he was a child.

“It definitely has its roots in the 
film nights my family would have 
when I was a kid growing up in 
South Texas,” Rodriguez said. “My 
mother, aunts, uncles and even my 
grandmother all loved horror mov-
ies, and I was exposed to the genre 
at a very young age. They did, of 
course, scare me quite a bit, but 
viewing them was always accompa-
nied by a considerable amount of 
discourse over what was viewed. In 
a strange kind of way, I learned a 
lot of lessons about good and evil, 
fantasy and fiction, and human 

nature through these experiences.
But it wasn’t until Rodriguez 

moved to San Diego from 
Baltimore in 2009 that he decided 
to make horror a full-time commit-
ment.

“I found great events like the 
FilmOut Film Festival, the San 

Diego Asian 
Film Festival 
and the San 
Diego Latino 
Film Festival,” 
Rodriguez 
said.  “What I 
was astounded 
at, however, was 
the lack of such 
a celebration for 
genre. There are 

many such events just a couple of 
hours north of here in Los Angeles, 
so why was San Diego so lacking?”

Now, Rodriguez’s biggest chal-
lenge is sifting through all that 
blood-spattered gold to fill a 
unique roster for all three of his 
outlets. He’s done enough sifting 
to find more than a few favorites of 
his own.

“Off the top of my head, a 
filmmaker who truly elevates the 
genre is the Japanese filmmaker 
Kaneto Shindo, who passed away 
earlier this year,” Rodriguez said. 
“His horror films ‘Oni Baba’ and 
‘Kuroneko’ are truly stunning works 
of art that depict darkness in a way 
that is completely original and rel-
evant. Tod Browning’s ‘Freaks’ and 
Michael Powell’s ‘Peeping Tom’ were 
both great films that sadly hurt the 
directors’ careers. Alfred Hitchcock 
is another favorite who revolution-
ized what could be on screen with 
‘Psycho,’ and who could give weight 
and terror to something ridiculous 
in ‘The Birds.’”

The list goes on to include 
classics like “Frankenstein” and 
“Gojira,” as well as some modern 
favorites like Jaume Balagueró’s 
“Sleep Tight,” which Rodriguez had 

the pleasure of seeing at London’s 
FrightFest Horror Festival last 
month. But for Rodriguez, choos-
ing a favorite horror film is like 
choosing a favorite of his mutant, 
homicidal children. Not to men-
tion, the genre is far too complex, 
says Rodriguez, to judge each film 
by the same standards.

“People tend to compartmen-
talize it far more than I like,” 
Rodriguez said. “[There are] dif-
ferent subgenres with different 
purposes. Ultimately, it depends on 
what the filmmaker is trying to elic-
it in the audience. One thing I have 
found to be true is that the more 
psychological horror films, like 
those made by David Lynch or the 
film ‘Sleep Tight’ that I mentioned 
earlier, tend to stick in the memory 
more. I think this is because they 
focus on terrors that are embedded 
more deeply in the psyches or per-
sonalities of their characters, and 
those terrors require a little more 
involvement from the audience. 
Movies with a high gore factor usu-
ally aim for a more visceral experi-
ence. Because of that, it is more like 
a rollercoaster ride, which gives in-
the-moment thrills.”

The two-day film festival 
at Price Center Theater marks 
Horrible Imaginings’ first visit to 
UCSD, and Rodriguez is hope-
ful that guests will arrive ready to 
reflect in between screams. 

“All films are exploitation,” 
Rodriguez said. “They exploit our 
feelings in order to get us involved 
in a story. A romantic comedy 
exploits our ideals of romantic rela-
tionships, a documentary exploits 
our fascination with the people 
around us, and horror exploits 
our fears. I hope to see a packed 
house!”

The Horrible Imaginings Film 
Festival will Take place October 1 
and 2 at 8 p.m. in UCSD’s Price 
Center Theater. $5 for students, $10 
for public.

HUNTeR’S STeakHoUSe

Located in the out-back of Mission Valley’s sterile 
Hotel Circle, Hunter’s 
Steakhouse has been 
dishing out the sup-
posed “Best Prime Rib 
in Town” with a com-
mitment to small town 
hospitality.

Welcomed by the 
restaurant’s cozy, log 
cabin exterior, guests 
are presented by an 
unexpected clash of 
themes. On both the 
lower and upper levels of the steak-
house, old country paraphernalia is 
posted up on the walls of the dimly lit 
establishment. Although the wooden 
furnishings match the western, coun-
try atmosphere, this ambience is 
quickly disturbed by the wait staff ’s 
tropical-themed attire, complete with 
plastic leis.

The best way to dine is to prear-
range a group and order a selection of 
dishes to share. Hunter’s caters to both 
diet-conscious and gourmet diners, 
offering items ranging from shrimp 
cocktail and seasonal vegetable sides 

to bacon-filled potato 
skins and decadent 
chocolate tortes.

On the lighter side, 
Hunter’s Steakhouse 
serves their house sal-
ads in an unusual way. 
Using a device similar 
to a Lazy Susan, the wait 
staff presents and piles 
on the numerous top-
pings to your tableside 
salad. While ensuring 
personalization to the 
diner’s salad, the restau-
rant adds a touch of class 

with dressing in a silver gravy boat on 
the side.  

For the main entrée, diners are 
welcome to choose from a slab of the 
restaurant’s famous prime rib ($22), 
a large fist-sized sirloin steak ($21), 
and a generous filet of salmon — each 
with a side of their choice ($20). 
Although fish is not a specialty, the 
flame-broiled salmon was a welcome 
surprise. Seasoned with a hint of 
garlic, the salmon possessed a but-
tery consistency. The sirloin steak was 
comparable to any other steakhouse 
— a standard steak seasoned with salt 

and pepper. Finally, the not so petite 
cut of prime rib truly stood far above 
the rest — maintaining its stand-
ing as the star of the establishment. 
Encrusted with herbs and paired with 
its rich ruby port au jus and creamy 
horseradish sauce, this melt-in-your- 
mouth delight is guaranteed to satisfy 
any steak-lover’s craving. 

For dessert, diners can’t go wrong 
with either the carrot cake or the 
Chocolate Oblivion. The carrot cake’s 
flavors are far from compromised by 
its light, airy texture and whipped 
cream cheese frosting. However, with 
a rich, dense body, the Chocolate 

Oblivion is no doubt an indulgence 
worth trying.

Despite the confusing ambience, 
Hunter’s Steakhouse still delivers. 
Even after all these years, its prime rib 
is the star of this rustic establishment. 
And while the long-awaited San Diego 
Restaurant Week occurs only twice 
a year at the end of September and 
January, Hunter’s Steakhouse offers its 
Restaurant Week menu year-round 
on Monday and Tuesday night for a 
reasonable $23.

Greek life is a facet of college 
that many people already have 
opinions about. Whether you 
already know that you absolutely 
want to be involved or want to 
avoid it at all costs, there are some 
things about Greek life that can’t be 
entirely understood based on hear-
say or stereotypes. Those involved 
seem to love it and those that are 
not a part of it have varied opinions 
of indifference, jealousy and dis-
like. Cortes thinks that Greeks are 
viewed in an unfairly negative light 
on campus. 

“Overall and at UCSD especial-
ly, Greek life is not as prevalent or 
promoted in a positive way so, in a 
sense, Greek life has a negative con-
notation with partying, hazing and 
drinking,” Cortes said. “I disagree 
with this completely.” 

Pi Kappa Alpha chapter 
President David Ianacone agrees 
that the image of Greek life on 

campus is negative and portrayed 
in a stereotypical fashion. He 
admits to being turned off to the 
idea of it his first year on campus, 
only to rush later on in his college 
career.

“It’s socially mediocre [at 
UCSD] in general and people think 
the Greek system is a huge drinking 
club basically,” he said. “That’s the 
feeling I get and when I talk to peo-
ple that rush they say that’s what 
they thought and once they rush or 
get in, it’s completely different.” 

Ianacone thinks that overlook-
ing these stereotypes and giving 
Greek life a chance is the best way 
to see what it’s really like. 

“I feel like from the outside it 
might look like what we do is have 
parties because that’s what people 
hear about,” Ianacone said. “It’s not 
all about social events. It’s about 
guys and girls collectively working 
toward common goals.” 

aLTeRNaTIveS

If going Greek doesn’t appeal to 
you there are so many other stu-
dent organizations on campus that 
there are bound to be a few that 
seem right for you. Information 
about clubs, orgs, teams and more 
will literally overflow library walk 
during the first few weeks of school 
and websites like solo.ucsd.edu are 
always available with a list of all 
registered student organizations. 

Seriously, you name it, UCSD has 
it. There’s taiko drumming, several 
magazines and newspapers all of 
different styles, cultural organiza-
tions and clubs created to help 
students with their professional 
endeavors. It may seem cheesy but 
getting involved on campus is truly 
the best way to get the most of 
your time and money while here at 
UCSD. 

PRofeSSIoNaL aND MULTICULTURaL

In addition to IFC and 
Panhellenic Greek organizations, 
UCSD also offers many professional 
and multicultural chapters that add 
a bit more to traditional Greek life. 
Although members also sport Greek 
letters and hold many social events, 
professional and multicultural fra-
ternities and sororities are meant 
for people with common niches 
such as their cultural background 

or professional aspirations. Being 
in a pre-law or pre-med fraternity 
(which are often co-ed) creates a 
support system of those that have 
similar interests to the rushee as well 
as a long list of potential study bud-
dies. Multicultural fraternities and 
sororities are ideal for those seeking 
brotherhood and sisterhood based 
on their personal and familial back-
grounds. 

Unlike most traditional college 
campuses, Greeks at UCSD do not 
have housing on or near campus. 
There have been proposals for cre-
ating a fraternity row, but no such 
developments have been made. 

The silver lining to the lack of 
housing is that it cuts financial costs 
for Greeks by a lot. Registering for 
sorority rush costs $40 dollars, and 
once a member, there are quarterly 
fees that range from about $200 
to $600 depending on the chapter. 
Greek fees are much higher at most 
other universities. 

“Just like with school there are 
financial aid options,” Interfraternity 

Council (IFC) President Chris 
Chang said. “The thing about that 
is a lot of different schools pay a 
hefty amount and I see it more as 
an investment in the future. To pay 
a year’s worth of dues to be a part of 
something for your life, I think that’s 
a pretty good experience.” 

The lack of a frat row creates a 
less formal space for recruitment, 
which may be less intimidating for 
the rushees. Financial aid options 
are available for those that think 
they can’t pay their dues. Chang 
says that his fraternity does not 
turn down members who are 
unable to pay.

frightening. And what was with the 
log lady? The television was obvi-
ously very sick. 

Simply by virtue of its idiosyn-
crasies, “Peaks’” cult status was 
inevitable, and practically every 
fan has his or her own reasons for 
loving the show. And because it’s 
simultaneously familiar and alien, 
many would instinctually assume 
the show’s primary intentions 
were to satirize the American soap 
opera, in the tradition of Norman 
Lear’s great “Mary Hartman, Mary 
Hartman.” But this would be far too 
shallow and dismissive a conclusion. 
Just what is Bob a parody of? Or 
the wise and spectral log lady who 
speaks only in cryptic verse? Or the 
astoundingly sincere Major Garland 
Briggs who drops nuggets of pro-
found cosmic knowledge upon his 
absent rebel son? “Twin Peaks” feels 
like a soap opera precisely because 
it is one — albeit an exceptionally 
strange and beautiful one. 

In fact, it’s more than one. 
Once we are cast abruptly into 

the restless, anarchic and much 
weirder second season (no longer 
anchored by the deliberate continu-
ity of Lynch’s direction), the plot 
tendrils at the perimeter of Laura 
Palmer’s death begin to split, multi-
ply and mutate — many growing out 
of control, and many others trailing 
off and dissolving an episode after 
they were birthed. The cancer has 
slowly been introduced. In season 
two, mitosis begins. 

Murder number two sets off the 
most glaring (and literal) detour, 
when clay-faced and ever-pouting 
James Hurley finally gets fed up with 
this shit town and all of its stupid 

melodrama and love triangles and 
parasitic demons killing everyone 
he’s ever loved. He’s got to leave 
this place. Don’t you understand, 
Donna? He’s got get on his bike and 
ride as far away from Twin Peaks 
as it will take him. So after leaving 
a weeping Donna in the dust of his 
Harley, James “drifts” to another 
backwater town — practically iden-
tical to Twin Peaks — whose only 
inhabitants seem to be a wealthy 
cougar, her abusive husband and her 
morally ambiguous secret lover that 
she keeps chained up in a basement 
or something. 

What black hole has James 
fallen into? Despite his best efforts 
to escape, he’s now found himself 
trapped in an entirely new soap 
opera — this one filled with even 
more scheming, cheating and oozing 
melodrama. It’s  Lynch reminding us 
that Twin Peaks is indeed a part of 
TV’s  self-contained alterniverse — it 
isn’t a parody of “General Hospital,” 
it’s just up the road from it. 

Meanwhile, “Peaks’” shimmering 
beacon of innocence and naivete, 
Deputy Andy, and effeminate a-hole 
Dick Tremayne (once the most 
awkward of enemies, now the most 
unlikely of allies) try to get to the 
bottom of yet another small town 
mystery: is the little boy that Dick 
adopted as part of a big brother 
program really possessed by Satan? 
Stay tuned!

Of course, these mutant Brady 
Bunch shenanigans go nowhere in 
particular (filed alongside Nadine’s 
super-strength, Audrey’s fling with 
that pilot, Ben’s epic civil war delu-
sion and basically anything having to 
do with Josie), but they are absolute-
ly crucial in creating the essence that 
is Twin Peaks. In these caricatures, 

and their dismembered subplots, we 
find Lynch’s key driving force: pure 
love. It’s a love for film and television 
that prevents the bisecting storylines 
from sitting still. It’s also a love for 
his characters, as well as a more uni-
versal compassion, that makes “Twin 
Peaks” so endlessly rewatchable. 

This manifests itself most nota-
bly in Lynch’s relationship with the 
abominable Leo Johnson. Anyone 
who’s seen interviews with Lynch 
knows that the filmmaker is a Boy 
Scout — polite, eloquent and dorky. 
He speaks of abstraction and sur-
realism the way your uncle might 
describe the best method for catch-
ing trout. Leo Johnson is Lynch’s 
(and Cooper’s) foil: senselessly vul-
gar, mean-spirited, seedy and wildly 
abusive to his faithful wife Shelly. So 

Lynch, as divine creator of the “Twin 
Peaks” world, sets about punishing 
Leo in every way, shape and form, 
entering Leo into a season-long walk 
through hell beginning with his veg-
etative coma (which essentially turns 
Leo into a comical prop) and ending 
with his becoming Windom Earle’s 
dancing monkey. If this weren’t 
enough, Lynch seals Leo’s fate by 
stealing a kiss from Shelly in his own 
walk-on role as Gordon Cole (who, 
it seems important to note, is every-
one’s benevolent superior and no 
one’s oppressor in “Twin Peaks”). 

But despite the meandering, 
all roads do eventually lead to the 
black lodge. Darkness remains, 
and must be confronted eventu-
ally. However, Lynch poses that it 
is only with this love — for people, 

for emotion, for horror and comedy 
and unbridled zaniness — that we 
can fight against it. 

Fitting, then, that Lynch’s only 
true fear lies not in the nightmare 
visions he conjures, but in — as 
revealed by “Twin Peaks’” legendary 
orator Major Garland Briggs — “the 
possibility that love is not enough.”

I’d like to dedicate this first col-
umn to artist, activist and family 
friend Aaron Blazer, who passed 
away unexpectedly this summer after 
suffering a heart attack. Thank you 
for reading my stuff, and for engag-
ing. I was truly grateful for that. The 
last we chatted, it was about Lynch, 
so here’s to you. R.I.P.

I t feels almost impossible to give a numerical rating to Kreayshawn’s debut album, Somethin ‘Bout 
Kreay. None of the tracks feel like 
actual music, per se, but rather, an 
aimless jumble of erratic dance beats 
and what can only be described as 
atonal, school-girl chattering.

Take “K234YSONIXZ,” easily the 
worst song on the album and the 
worst-spelled song in musical history. 

Copping the “Supersonic” sample 
used in “Fergalicious,” but none of the 
catchy wordplay, Kreayshawn rhymes 
“money” with “money,” “up” with 
“up” and, most remarkably, “over” and 
“lover.” The main hook consists of one 
line the rapper barely has the breath 
to utter: “All them haters ask me what 
I’m doing/ I just simply tell them, 
‘Kreaysonic.” Whatever that means.

Kreayshawn has a few decent col-
laborators in the mix, but all of them 
seem indifferent. Kid Cudi turns 
out one of his weird, mumbly rock 
performances on “Like It Or Love 
It,” barely accentuating any lines like 
he’s in the middle of exhaling blunt 
smoke (he probably was). Diplo both 
produces and attempts rapping on the 
surprisingly untwerkable “Twerkin!!!” 
— and even his low-key mutterings 
are more tolerable than Kreayshawn’s 
shrill chanting. She finds a more apt 

teammate on “Breakfast (Syrup)” with 
2 Chainz, an artist with precisely the 
same goofy self-confidence and none 
of the skills to back it up.

One might begin to wonder: Was 
“Gucci Gucci,” the Youtube hit that 
landed her this record deal, some per-
fect accident? Is Kreayshawn no dif-
ferent than William Hung or Rebecca 
Black — an “artist” no one could pos-
sibly listen to sincerely?

The answer is beside the point.
Like Lil B and other Bay Area 

MC’s before her, Kreayshawn is clearly 
not out to make timeless music — an 
admirable alternative to self-serious 
mainstream hip hop. Not to mention 
it’s kind of punk rock to hear someone 
so astonishingly bad, she couldn’t pos-
sibly give a fuck about it.

INTERVIEW

UC President Mark Yudof  
Addresses Criticism and 
Proposes Solutions

UC Merced: On the state budget 
and tuition: as you probably 
know, since 1980, the percent of 
state budget spent on corrections 
facilities and prisons has increased 
significantly. Meanwhile, the portion 
of the budget allocated to higher 
education has dropped. Should we 
take a stance against this to  prevent 
further tuition increases?

Yudof: Well, I have certainly taken 
that position. I’ve said many times 
to the governors and the legislators 
that it’s a total embarrassment that 
the expenditures on prisoners are a 
multiple of what they are on higher 
education. We now have half as much 
to spend per student than we did 10, 
20 years ago, and the priorities are 
upside-down. 

I don’t control the votes in the 
legislature, but I think you’re exactly 
right. I see Prop. 30 [a voter initative 
to increase sales and income tax to 
fund public education] as, perhaps, 
at least an opening salvo to try and 
change that and try to get increasing 
appropriations for the university. 
As you know, we’re down virtually a 
billion dollars in the last four years, 
we’ll be down another $375 million if 
Prop. 30 doesn’t pass. We have a $22 
billion-plus budget, and $2 billion, 
roughly, if it doesn’t pass, will come 
from the state of California. So this 
is a disgrace in my view, and a lack of 
commitment to the students. 

UC Riverside: At last week’s 
Regents meeting, there were many 
long-term proposals to increase 
revenues or cut spending across 
the UC system. These included 
increasing enrollment of out-of-state 
students and making some majors 
or campuses more expensive than 

others. Which of these appeal most 
to you and why?

Yudof: I would say the differential 
tuition by campus or by discipline is 
probably near the very end of the list. 
It’s very unpopular with students, the 
regents, and the faculty. I don’t want to 
rule anything out forever, but I would 
say if there were 20 proposals, that 
would be twentieth on the list. I would 
say the what makes the most sense 
is restructuring our debt, which was 
blocked in the legislature last time. 

It would enable us to pay less 
money to Wall Street by refinancing 
things and paying lower interest rates. 
For whatever reason, it was blocked. 

We could save a block of money there, 
up to $80 million per year, which 
would be an $80 million offset of any 
tuition increase that might be needed. 

Our first obligation is to 
Californians. But the truth is that 
we’re so under-funded, that when we 
enroll a non-resident and they pay 
full freight, that enables us to admit 
a Californian. And actually, our 

California enrollment has been going 
up, even as non-resident enrollment 
has gone up. 

I would guess those are probably 
the ones near the top. There are some 
things we can do with the IT systems 
that would make sense. Other things 
are pretty draconian. We can freeze 
faculty hiring, and even though we’re 
already 15 percent below market on 
faculty salaries, we could do some of 
that. 

We could trim health and welfare 
benefits, but that would take some 
time and some consultation with 
the labor unions and with our non-
represented employees. That’s pretty 
much the picture as I see it. We’re 
going to be working diligently, because 
even if Prop. 30 passes, we’re hundreds 
of millions of dollars short. The state 
gave us $90 million, and cover our 
biggest cost-drivers, our pensions. We 
reformed our pension two years ago, 
or the state did, but it’s expensive to fix 
it, and health benefits are very costly 
for us, and then energy costs and a few 
other things.   

UC Riverside: You’ve been a 
leading voice in the UC urging 
support for Prop. 30. If you were 
to meet a UC student on the street 
today, what would you say to the 
student about the significance of 
the upcoming election? How might 
possible outcomes of the election 
affect the student?

Yudof: I would say to the student 
that this is critical. This has more of a 
direct relationship to your pocketbook 
than virtually anything that I can 
imagine. It may be that if the speaker’s 
bill [The Middle Class Scholarship 
Act, a bill that would have provided 
scholarships for students whose 

household income falls between 
$70,000 and $150,000] had passed 
and we had gotten more scholarship 
money, that would have been a big 
help. But absent something like that, 
we need to have a steady stream of 
increasing appropriations. And we 
have worked out a plan. It’s not official, 
it’s not approved by everyone, but 
believe it or not, in about five years, we 
could be back at 2007-08 levels of state 
appropriations. That would take a lot 
of pressure off of tuition. And it’s just a 
little bit more on the sales tax and the 
income tax. 

I used to do local and state taxes 
when I was a law professor, but this 
really is an opportunity to reverse this 
20-year trend and have increasing 
appropriations to the university for a 
decade. And we have a big, big swing 
on this. We froze tuition, but no one 
paid for it, and that’s $125 million. 
And in addition to that, if it doesn’t 
pass, we’ll have another $250 million 
in cuts. We have a $400 million 
swing. And $400 million is one hell 
of a lot of student tuition money, just 
take my word for it, do the math. So 
I would say, if we get this done, we 
can maintain the quality, maintain 
the faculty. I don’t promise no tuition 
increases, but I’m hoping we could 
keep them in the single digits, rather 
than what you’ve seen over the last 
five to 10 years. That’s what I would 
tell them. And I hope you do tell your 
parents and your friends this election 
matters. And that’s every opportunity. 
When I’m out on the hustle, speaking, 
I do that. And as you know, we’re 
going to need each vote. And as you 
know, we got the Board of Regents to 
endorse it, with only one dissenting 
vote, so I’m very hopeful. But the polls 
are close, as you know.

UC Davis: A report was published 
in the Huffington Post this year about 
private schools like Harvard and 
Yale now being cheaper than many 
of California’s public schools. 

Yudof: Not true. Categorically not 
true. We would be happy to provide 
the data. I don’t remember the article, 
but we’re charging $12,000 a year for 
residents, half of our students pay no 
tuition at all, we have 40 percent low-
income kids. If you’re an out-of-state 
student, maybe that’s the comparison, 
it’s $30-some thousand in tuition, but 
it’s still less. If you have a friend who’s a 
student at NYU, it’s like $62,000 a year. 

What the article may have meant 
is that certain individual students may 
get more financial aid. They [NYU 
and other private schools] have much 
deeper pockets than we have. But 
most of those schools have only 10 to 
15 percent low-income kids, and we 
have 40 percent. For some individual 
students, Stanford may offer a package, 
which Irvine or Davis or whatever 
simply cannot match, and maybe that’s 
what they meant, but there aren’t that 
many of those students. I hate to miss 
any of them, by the way — I’d like to 
keep them all. But realistically, they 

have a much larger endowment than 
we do.

UC Davis: In light of Prop. 30, 
what strategies does UC have to keep 
UC schools an economical option 
for both in-state and out-of-state 
students?

Yudof: You know, we have the 
most generous financial aid system 
in the United States. Thirty percent 
of our tuition gets turned back into 
financial aid. In addition to that, 
we have Pell Grants and we have 
Cal Grants. The result is, half of our 
students pay no tuition. That’s pretty 
affordable. I don’t say it’s free, I mean, 
you have to have a roof over your 
head, you have to eat, you have to buy 
books, you have to travel, you have 
issues, but in this world, that’s pretty 
good. Our average debt is $120,000 
a year, we’ve controlled it pretty well. 
That’s significantly below the national 
average, and I’m talking about only 
public universities, for private, it can 
be much, much higher. So I think we’ve 
done a good job. So I’m not saying it’s 
easy. We live in a world of foreclosures 
and unemployment and I think giving 
prospects for college graduates, I hope 
it gets better, so I’m not saying it’s easy, 
but we’ve worked awfully hard to keep 
it affordable.

UC Irvine: Regarding the 
upcoming UC campuswide campus 
climate survey, what can students 
expect in terms of being able to 
participate and just being aware 
of it, and also once the results are 
compiled, how accessible will the 
findings be, and in light of previous 
reports, what differences will we see 
in terms of dealing with campus 
climate issues?

Yudof: That’s a tough set of 
questions. I mean, we’re going to 
advertise it. We need to get at least 
30-percent participation for it to be 
valid. And by the way, it’s students, 
faculty and staff. So, you know, to 
the best of our ability, we’re going 
to advertise and try to make people 
aware, because the higher the rate 
of return, the more accurate the 
survey is. You can help us in your 
newspapers, and student government 
can help, because this is not a random 
sample type thing. In the ideal world, 
everyone would respond, so we’d have 
a really good sample. If we don’t get 
30 percent, my fear is it wouldn’t be 
accurate. The return, the information 
will be totally public. We will make 
it public, probably put it online or 
share it with you. I’m hoping it will 
lead to more intelligent policy. We’d 
like to know what you think. If you’re 
gay and on the staff, do you feel that 
you’re appreciated, or do you think 
there are impediments in your career? 
And frankly, it’s a lot of money, like a 
half million or $600,000 and time that 
is not great for us financially. But if 
we’re ever going to make progress on 
the campus climate issues, we need to

On Sept. 19, student media editors from nine UC campuses, including the Guardian’s News Editor Zev Hurwitz, participated in a phone interview with 
UC President Mark G. Yudof. The editors asked questions regarding topics from 
campus climate issues to tuition and budget cuts. Below is an edited transcript of  
President Yudof ’s input. 

“ I think I and the chancellors ought to 
speak out: We have a 
moral obligation, when 
people are anti-Semitic 
or anti-Muslim or anti-
gay or anti-African-
American or whatever, 
but we cannot and 
should not try to 
prevent speech.”

i n d e p e n d e n t  /  i n n o v a t i v e  /  i n s p i r i n g

know exactly what the problems are. 

UC San Diego: There’s been a lot 
of buzz about the advisory council 
on campus climate reports both for 
the Jewish and Arab-Muslim student 
reports. How are you approaching 
the findings of the report, and when 
can we expect a decision regarding 
the Jewish report’s recommendation 
to ban “hate speech” on campuses, 
and what about all the other 
recommendations in both reports?

Yudof: There’s a lot of 
misinformation about that. These sets 
of recommendations are not coming to 
a vote in the campus climate committee. 
These are reports that I commissioned 
to advise me, and my staff and I will be 
wading through them and looking to 
see what makes sense. For example, the 
report on Muslim students had some 
recommendations about community 
places for prayer for Muslim students. 
I’ve already brought that to the 
attention of the chancellors, and we’re 
working to follow through. So we’re 
going to go through them, but there’s 
no up or down vote on it. Second, I 
wish I could create a hate-free campus. 
I’m a constitutional lawyer. I’ve taught 
First Amendment for 25, 30 years. 
We can’t do it. If by “hate-free,” you 
mean people cannot speak out about 
what they think about other people or 
events or whatever, then you’re simply 
banning pure speech. It is the case 
that we have protected Klu Klux Klan 
speech in Illinois, we have protected 
draft dodgers in the First World War, 
and their speech, which advised people 
not to report for the draft. We protect 
speech in this country, and that’s what 
our First Amendment is all about, so 
I’d like our campuses to be hate-free. 

I think I and the chancellors ought to 
speak out: we have a moral obligation, 
when people are anti-Semitic or anti-
Muslim or anti-gay or anti-African-
American or whatever, but we cannot 
and should not try to prevent speech. 
The cure for bad speech is good 
speech. The climate on the campuses 
should be one of thriving diversity of 
opinion, and amidst all the flowers 
there will be some weeds, but we can’t 
chop them without jeopardizing the 
entire enterprise. 

UC San Diego: Recently there 
have been a couple of challenges 
to Proposition 209, the affirmative 
action ban, and the ban has been 
reaffirmed by recent court rulings. 
Will UC take any new steps to ensure 
that enrollment of minority students 
continues to increase? And does this 
remain a priority? 

Yudof: We filed a very strong brief 
in the United States Supreme Court, in 
the Fisher case, saying that, in effect, 
we’re not satisfied with our progress 
in achieving diversity. We believe 
Proposition 209 is a great impediment, 
and more relevant to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, we believe that the state should 
be free to practice affirmative action 
without violating the fourteenth 
Amendment, and we can shoot that 

brief off to you. That was signed by 
myself and all 11 chancellor. 

It’s very hard for us, I am deeply in 
favor of overturning Prop. 209, and at 
this point, given what’s happened to 
the courts, at least today, I don’t think 
a legal challenge is likely to succeed. 
Although it would be great if it did. 
What we have done is we have tried to 
redouble our efforts to recruit in the 
high schools, we’ve tried to give a lot 
of scholarship money to low-income 
kids, many of whom are Hispanic or 
African-American and so forth, and 
we have a holistic admissions system 
on the nine academic campuses, so 
your life is not summed up into two 
numbers, your grade-point average 
and your SAT score. We’ve tried to 
do as best we can the things that 
would strengthen the possibilities for 
more underrepresented groups that 
need admission to the university. But 
frankly, 209 does tie our hands to a 
large extent. It’s just true.

UC Santa Cruz: The UC faces 
$300 million in funding gaps for this 
fiscal year, and if Prop. 30 doesn’t 
pass, an additional budget gap of 
$375 million in cuts will happen. 
You said in your opening remarks 
at last week’s Regents meeting that 
you would not discuss increasing 
tuition. If Prop. 30 does pass, is there 
any chance you could see plans for 
decreasing tuition in the long term?

Yudof:  We’re not going to discuss 
tuition at that board meeting, because I 
wanted to focus on alternatives, things 
we could do to either not raise tuition 
or to reduce the amount that would 
be raised. So I was trying to keep 
the board focused on these 10 or 20 
proposals, I didn’t say it would not be 
raised. I think the chances are very high 

tuition will be raised. Even if Prop. 30 
passes, we’re down $879 million in the 
last four years, and the amount of new 
money from the state is $90 million. 
The big ticket items are pension funds, 
compensation for faculty and health 
benefits, energy costs and a bunch of 
other things, and so my plan is to put 
together a total package for November. 
Really, it’s going to be two plans: one 
if Prop 30 passes, and one if it doesn’t. 
I wish I could tell you otherwise, I 
think the probability is quite high. Our 
budget is going down, if it does not 
pass, from $3.4 billion to it’ll probably 
be under $2 million within a four year 
period. Most prices will continue to go 
up. A third of tuition is put back into 
scholarships. It’s highly re-distributed, 
the way we do it. We will probably be 
discussing it in November, along with 
a bunch of other proposals to save 
money, to tamp down as much as we 
can any possible tuition increase.

UC Santa Cruz: Do you think 
students will continue seeking out 
the University of California if tuition 
continues to rise as it has?

Yudof: Obviously it depends on 
how much it rises, but applications 

are up 9 percent this year. You’re 
talking about some of the world’s 
best universities at $12,000 a year. 
And you compare that to other public 
universities around the country, 
most of them don’t have anywhere 
near our quality. Now, I mean, your 
point’s excellent. If the tuition goes up 
too much, people are price-sensitive, 
but I don’t think we’re anywhere near 
that price point. In light of historic 
tuition increases, applications, and 
I’m talking about residents, non-
residents are also up 10 percent, 
they’re up 9 percent. So you’re getting 
a very high quality education at a very 
good price, even if it hurts. Part of the 
problem is, it’s a dereliction of the 
“master plan” [a term used to refer 
to California’s system of high taxes 
and high public benefits] and the 
way it was supposed to be. And the 
state of California loves the master 
plan. It just doesn’t want to pay for 
it. And that’s sort of a problem. The 
quality is there, the access is there, 
and we’re maintaining affordability as 
best we can. We still have more Nobel 
Laureates than most countries. And I 
hope we’ll be able to slow this rise in 
tuition down: it’s not healthy for us, 
it’s not healthy for you, either.

Women’s Volleyball Rely Heavily on Young Talent UCSD Improves on 2011 Results
BY NASH HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — In 2011 
UCSD Women’s Volleyball rose to as 
high as No. 15 in the nation at the 
Division II level. And last season, two 
of the four graduating seniors, Hilary 
Williamson and Roxanne Brunsting, 
were named to the all-CCAA team, 
with outside hitter Katie Condon earn-
ing second team all-CCAA honors. 
With three of their central players 
graduating, the pressure was on head 
coach Ricci Luyties to bring in some 
new talent. 
    Heading into the 2012 season, six 
freshmen and one transfer, along with 
the returning underclassmen have pro-
duced an entirely different yet poten-
tially dominant team. 
    Of those returning, sophomore 
Amber Hawthorne, who averaged 5.17 
assists per set last season, has more 
than filled the shoes of Brunsting. 
    Hawthorne has stepped up as a leader 
on this year’s team, with 39 assists 
in UCSD’s victory against Cal Poly 
Pomona last Thursday, and 27 assists in 
the UCSD sweep against Humboldt on 
Sept. 22, she is consistently playing at 
the level UCSD needs to be at to prog-
ress higher in  the CCAA Tournament.
    Middle blockers Lauren Demos and 
Sara McCutchan have also assumed 
leadership position for UCSD this sea-
son. Demos and McCutchan have put 
in impressive work on defense and 

offense for the Tritons, exemplified in 
their 35 kills and 6 block assists in 
the Tritons’ victory against CSU Los 
Angeles.
    The UCSD Women’s Volleyball 
team opened the 2012 season at the 
Grand Canyon University Invitational 
in Phoenix, Ariz. where they split their 
games 2-2. The Tritons took wins 
against Western New Mexico and UC 

Colorado Springs, but fell to No. 15 
Grand Canyon University and No. 10 
Metropolitan State. 
    Freshman standout Danielle Dahle 
was named to the All-Tournament 
Team and has continued to prove her-
self an asset to the Triton offense. The 
La Mesa, Calif. native also garnered 
All-Tournament honors the follow-
ing week in the Sonoma State Seawolf 
Spike, and has continued to play well 
averaging 13 kills thus far in confer-
ence play.

    Competing in Ronhert Park, the 
Tritons fought for promising wins over 
No. 13 Western Washington, Seattle 
Pacific and Dominican.
    With the pre-season over, UCSD 
began CCAA conference play with 
a shaky first home match against 
unranked CSU Dominguez Hills, fall-
ing to the Toros in three sets. 
    The Tritons refocused their energy 

towards Cal State L.A., where UCSD 
showed play reminiscent of the more 
experienced 2011 squad. Defeating 
the Golden Eagles in four sets, UCSD 
began to climb up the CCAA rankings. 
    The Tritons went on to best Cal 
Poly Pomona 3-1, followed by a domi-
nant closeout victory in Arcata over 
Humboldt State.
  Next Friday, the Tritons face off 
against No. 25 ranked Chico State, who 
at 4-0, are yet to be defeated in the 
CCAA this year.

MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY — In 2011, 
senior Matt Lenehan was the top run-
ner for Triton Cross Country, repre-
senting UCSD on the all-CCAA team.
However, this season Lenehan chose 
to redshirt, leaving room for junior 
Kellen Levy to step up and assume the 
role as leader on this year’s squad.

On Sept. 2, the Tritons officially 
opened the season, hosting a three-
team meet. Levy led a well paced pack 
of Tritons, and took the individual vic-
tory finishing the four-mile race with 
a time of 22:19.6. 

The remaining 13 Tritons took all 
but one of the 14 next top finishes. 

Earlier, at the UC Irvine Invitational 
on Sept. 8, the Triton men took second 
in a field which included a bevy of 
Division I schools. Levy, with a time 
of 25:46.9, and the CCAA’s Runner of 
the Week,  placed ninth and cracked 
the All-Time List at UC San Diego in 
the 8k. Freshman Scott Acton, who 
finished second with a time of 21:56.7, 
has definitely proven himself an asset. 

Acton had an impressive run at the 
Lancer Classic hosted by Cal Baptist 
on Sept. 22. Acton finished third, lead-
ing his team to a well deserved victory 
over the Lancers.

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY — 
With 13 underclassmen and two 
returning All-CCAA runners in junior 
Chia Chang and sophomore Michelle 
Le Roux, the UCSD Women’s Cross 
Country team is undoubtedly talented 
and developing a sense of depth.
    Chang, the returning CCAA Racer of 
the Year has established herself again as 
UCSD’s most dominant Women’s Cross 
Country runner. 

In 2011, she was UCSD’s top run-
ner in all six races she competed in, 
and, again in 2012, she led the Tritons 
to a second place finish at the UC San 
Diego opener, falling to Division I San 
Diego State.
    Freshman Carolina Guzman, who 
finished third behind Chang, has been 
racing extremely well. The following 
week at the UC Irvine Invitational, 
Chang and Guzman had a strong 

showing against Division I powerhous-
es University of Arkansas, USC and 
CSU Long Beach. 
    After a fortnight’s worth of training 
and rest, the Tritons came out strong at 
the Cal Baptist Invitational, just edging 
out the Lancers for a 35-36 win. 
Chang led UCSD for the ninth time, 
followed by senior Elena Inouye and 
sophomore All-CCAA selection 
Michelle LeRoux in fifth and sixth 
place, respectively. This Saturday, Oct. 
6, UCSD will host the annual Triton 
Classic Invitational. Serving as a pre-
view for this years CCAA race, teams 
within the conference, as well as mul-
tiple Division I programs, will start the 
race at RIMAC field, and finish at the 
Triton Track & Field complex. 
    The men’s 8k race is set to begin at 9 
a.m. followed by the Women’s 6k race 
at 9 a.m.

83rd minute. The Tritons took another 
1-0 win against Cal Poly Pomona.

UCSD’s next two conference 
matches went to double overtime, as 
CSU Los Angeles finished in the 115th 
minute to best the Tritons, before 
UCSD settled for a tie against CSU 
San Bernardino.

Last Sunday, Sept. 23 the Tritons 

fought San Francisco State to a 0-0 tie. 
To date, UCSD is off to their best 

start in recent memory. At 4-2-2 it 
seems that the Tritons have finally 
broken out of the familiar pattern of 
starting slow and finishing strong.

“Throughout the [2011] season, 
what has let us down was our con-
sistency,” UCSD assistant coach Eric 

Bucchere said. “But with all of our 
team back next year, I think we can 
look at this as a lesson for next season 
and hopefully we can find more of a 
consistent rhythm and make a run at 
the playoffs.”

This season, look for the Tritons 
to be a contender in the CCAA post-
season race.

Stiling has already netted 15 goals for 
the Tritons. UCSD got off to a bumpy 
start to the 2012 campaign, dropping 
to No. 5 UC Santa Barbara on Sept. 
8 and No. 6 UC Irvine the following 
week at the Norcal Tournament. No. 
11 UCSD took its first win in a double 

overtime bout against No. 16 Air Force, 
before falling to Southern California 
rivals No. 10 Loyola Marymount 6-1. 
The Tritons have since put together 
a three-game win streak, leading into 
their homeopener against LMU to be 
played this Wednesday, Sept. 26.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — It would be 
easy for the UCSD Women’s Soccer 
team to write off the 2012 season as a 
rebuilding year.

The Tritons graduated eight players 
going into the 2012 season, including 
three All-Americans, top goal scorer 
Sarah McTigue and goalkeeper Kristin 
Armstrong, one of the most successful 
netminders in UCSD history. These 
players were the core that propelled the 
Tritons into the NCAA Championship 
title match in 2010, and the group that 
the program has been built on for the 
past three seasons.

“Last year’s seniors were an excep-
tional group of players,” UCSD Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. “But we 

have a strong group coming in, and I 
think that with that many key players 
having graduated it has forced others 
to step up.”

Last year, UCSD went 13-3-4 over-
all, coming up short in the CCAA 
semifinals and falling to CSU Chico 
in the second round of the National 
Tournament. 

Despite the changes UCSD has 
seen on the pitch, the Tritons will 
start this season at the top of the pre-
season California Collegiate Athletics 
Association poll, where the Tritons 
were picked to finish first in the CCAA 
South Division. UCSD began the sea-
son ranked No. 18 nationally, but has 
since risen to claim the No. 9 spot, as 
the Tritons (6-0) have yet to concede 
a loss.

“The goal is always the NCAA 

Tournament,” McManus said. “We 
thrive under the pressure of being 
picked to win the conference, and I 
think we have the players to do just 
that.” This season the Tritons rely heav-
ily on their senior class — six play-
ers who have made three trips to the 
NCAA Championships and have seen 
three CCAA championship tourna-
ments. Co-captains Hayley Johnson 
and Ellen Wilson — both two-time 
CCAA first team selections — anchor 
the Triton backline along with senior 
transfer Cassie Callahan.

Striking for the Tritons are juniors 
Izzy Pozurama and Laura Gordon. 
The pair are flanked by wingers Alexa 
Enlow and Jessica Wi in the attack. 
Senior Danielle Dixon will be back in 
the midfield alongside 2011 CCAA 
Newcomer of the Year winner Cassie 

Callahan. Assistant coach Kristin 
Jones, says the 2012 squad may lack the 
marquee players characteristic of teams 
past, but their ability to play together 
will make them dangerous nonetheless.

“I think we’re always competitive in 
the CCAA because we play a different 

brand of soccer,” Jones said. “We’re not 
like a lot of other teams in the confer-
ence who depend on goal-scoring from 
one or two players. We have so many 
different players capable of generating 
offense that we’re dangerous from all 
over the field.”

In 2011, the UCSD Men’s Soccer 
team came up just short of a postseason 
berth. But the Tritons went on to end 
the season with an inspired four game 
winning streak, finishing with a 10-8-0 
overall record, 9-7-0 in the CCAA.

This season head coach Jon Pascale 
fields a much more experienced squad, 
as the Tritons did not graduate a single 
player from the 2011 roster.

With the exception of seniors, goal-
keeper Jesse Brennan and defender 

Harris Rabin — both out due to injury 
— UCSD’s starting lineup looks close 
to that of last season. 

Forwards, senior Evan Walker and 
junior Sam Ball, retain their spots 
up top for the Tritons, while juniors 
Cory Wolfrom, Gavin Lamming and 
Andrew Keimach hold down the back 
line with junior Josh Cohen in goal.

In the midfield, Pascale’s afforded 
the luxury of picking from a number 
of talented halfbacks, including pacy 
wingers Kian Malek, Adam Zernik and 
Andisheh  Bagheri.

The Tritons kicked off the 2012 

campaign by splitting their only two 
preseason matches, losing 0-2 to Cal 
Baptist before topping Academy of the 
Art 2-0.

UCSD won its first conference 
match the following week against San 
Francisco State as junior Adam Zernik

2011 RecoRd:  13-3-4 (12-1-3 in ccaa)

RetuRning staRteRs:  6 - d Hayley Johnson, d ellen wilson,

bottom line:  despite losing three all-americans, the tritons 
have proven themselves potent. the women’s soccer team’s 6-0 
record puts it at the top of the ccaa conference standings, as 
the tritons head into the thick of ccaa south division play.

bottom line:  with nearly 
alll of their starters back, the 
tritons should be able to 
match or improve their 2011 
win total. look for ucsd to 
be outside contenders in the 
ccaa postseaosn race.

2011 RecoRd:  17-11 
 
RetuRning staRteRs:  4- 
utl John butler, utl brian

bottom line:  the tritons 
claimed their first wwPa 
conference title in five years 
last season. but without 
all-american david morton 
in goal and graham saber 
in the attack, the tritons 
will have their work cut out 
for them to get back to the 
ncaa tournament.
