now by thc Internet," he said . 
"They are vulnerable bccause they 
are dependent on cyberspace." 

Two years ago, the federal gov-
ernment spent $2 .7 billion to 
defcnd its computer systems 
against cyber attacks. For next year, 
$4.7 bill ion has been proposed, 
according to Clarke. 

Among those in attendance at 
the Neurosciences Insti tute includ-
ed Greg Cox, chairman of the San 
Diego Board of Supervisors, and 
Chuncellor Robert C. Dynes, who 

has been stressing the need for 
research universities like UCSD to 
focus not only on research and 
development of homeland security 
technologies, but also delivery. 

Panelists included representa-
tives of both public, military and 
private sectors, who discussed mea-
sures that their own organizations 
have taken to protect their net-
works. 

Chief Technology Officer for 
San Diego County Michael L. 
Moore sa id that although San 
Diego County survived the week-
end's attack, the county still needs 
to be more focused on new vulner-
abilitics. 

"Wc are trying to form partner-
ships with [other local agencies] 
and we are also trying to make 
awareness of data sharing and make 
sure that data we transfer back and

Revelle Sophomore Senator 

Achim Lyon voiced his displea ure 
with the committee's leanings 
toward Freshens during the ques-
tion-and-answer segment of the 
prcsentation, saying lhat he had 
hoped the new facility would fca-
ntre parlor shop ice cream along 
the line of Moo Time. 

Cogan responded by saying the 
commi ttee is sti ll open to sugges-

tions from A.S. Council members. 
According to the committee 

members, Freshens is a better 
choice than other brands because 
the brand charges less and has 
expressed eagerness to conduct 
business at UCSD. The committee 
members projected that with 
Freshens, they would see thei r ini-
tial investment paid back within 
three to four months of opening. 

Freshens, the committee said, is 
the "most compatible with overall 
goals," and the committee plans "to 
continue developing our enterprise 
strategy around Freshens brand." 

The ice cream parlor would be 
controlled by the A.S. Office of 
Enterprisc Operations, and revenue 
would be used to fund A.S. venntres. 

forth is safe," he said. 
Rob Broersma , network securi -

ty manager for the Space and Naval 
Warfare Systems Command, said 
that military networks are particu-
larly popular ones for cyber attacks. 
Attackers include civilian hackers, 
anti-military groups and foreign 
i ntell i gence. 

Because cyber attacks to the 
military's networks can put lives at 
risk, Broersma said that the mili -
tary is particularly vigilant about 
keeping security tight. 

"In the mil itary, a lot of our 
focu s is on protecting sensitive and 
classified information against 
unauthorized access disclosure [and 
to) ensure the liabi lity, avaibbility 
and integrity of the network even 
under attack," he said. "So the 
stakes are high." 

Broersma said that more 

Internet service providers needed 
to be more cooperative in terms of 
shutting down users who are hack-
ing. Additionally, he said that an 
increasing number of network per-
sonnel and policy makers do not 
know how the Internet works or 
how to use sec uri ty. 

Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman and 
chief executive of Qualcomm Inc., 
said that his company not only has 
to protect against cyber attacks but 
must also protect against attempts 
to stea l computer codes, of which 
an attempt was made. 

"That whole incident ca used us 
to realize this is a very serious issue, 
particularly if you arc a company 
that tries to innovate tcchnology," 
he said. "You want to be able to 
protect that open envirol~:r.cnt, but 
you also need to prrJtect that da ta." 

However, Clarke said that he 

believes that the infrastructure can 
be protected. 

"I think that by using our tech -
nologies in the universities, pri vate 
laboratories, government laborato-
ries, together we can come up with 
ways to make our critical infra -
Structures and computer networks 
secure while maintaining our pnva-
cy rights and our civil liberties," he 
said. 

Following the series of town 
hall meetings, President George 
W. Bu h will issue a national St~~J[_ 
egy to address cyber attack;; against 
national infrastruct:.:re. 

"Havi ng that strategy will be 
th~ ber;il1ning of what has to be a 
Public-private partnership where 
we all work together for the fore-
seeable future to identify the vul-
nerabilities in our networks," 
Clarke said. 

Music industry to pay consumers refunds 
Lawsuit alleges industry artificially raised price of albums 

By ANDREW BECK 
Washington Square News (New 

YOlk University) 
(U-WIRE) EW YORK -

Music enthusia ts are missing an 
opportunity to cash in on one of 
the nation 's largest music indus-
try lawsuits in years, and college 
students are among the millions 
of Americans who may be enti-
tled to com pen ation checks of 
up to $20, industry officials said. 

In August 2000, 41 states and 
twO U.S. territories filed a lawsuit 
against a host of music producers 
and distributors. Those named in 
the lawsuit allegedly collab:>rated 
to raise the minimum price of 
CDs, tapes and records. 

.~ ':!: 

Bertelsmann Music Group, 
Sony Music Enrerrainment, 
Warner-Elektra -Atlantic Corp., 
EMI Music Distribution , 
Universal Music Group, Tower 
Records, Mu ieland Stores and 
Transworld Entertai nment all 
agreed on a settlement totaling 
$143.1 million in September 
2002 . 

The Compact Di sc Minimum 
Advertised Price Anritrust 
Litigation Settlement will pro-
vide more than $67.4 million for 
cash payments to individuals who 
purchased music products during 
a five-year period , and will sup-
ply an additional $75.7 million 
worth of CDs to cha rities and 
other non-profit, music-related 

programs. 
Despite the millions of dollars 

that remain unclaimed, few con-
sumers are aware of the settle-
ment or ' their entitl ement to 
compensation. By the end of 
2002, only 30,000 people had 
filed a claim, acco rding to the 
Associated Press. 

Murat Akturk, an employee at 
Tower Records in New York 
City, aid that no one at the store 
had been informed about the 
lawsui t or was a ware of the possi-

b�e refunds. 
College students who had not 

heard about the settlement aid

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Affirmative action 
article overly trite 

Editor: 
I was delighted to see Ryan 

Darby'S article on affirmative 
action Gan. 27 issue of the 
Guardian), his latest attempt to 
bully people into hi s logic 
through sheer erudition. 

J am too uninformed to call 
Illy elf a supporter of affirmative 
action; the idea I've always had 
of affi rmat ive action is of an 
imperfect solution to a ternfy-
ingly complex problem, like the 
AIDS paticnt's cocktail of medi -
cllles. It 's no cure, but rather a 
de perate attempt to pro-acti ve-
ly fight the di ease, and without 
it, the pati en t might as well give 
up and die. 

The thing is, there's such 
thing as affirmative ac tion for 
whltcs toO, it 's just so ingrained 
111 to the Amcrican world that 
nobody notices it, and it's not 
exactly a law - it doc n't need to 
be .Affirmative ac ti on may not be 
the way to cure the Ul1Itcd tates 
of racism, but this unJJ1 fo rmed 
obse rver can not at the moment 
think of a bener treatment of the 
problem. 

As for Darby's statements 
about the 14th Amendment and 
Brown v. Board of Education, it's 
all a bunch o f hooey. Sec, the 
Fou rteenth Amendment provide 

for the equal protection under 
the law of all rights and privi-
leges of a ci tizen . The ruling in 
Brown v. Board of Education is 
that secondary puhllc educa tion 
IS a privilegc of cItizenship and 
segregated schools do not equal-
ly protect this pnvdege. On the 
oth er hand, ulllversity ed ucation 

" I seriously doubt if affir, 
mative octian is the best 
of possible courses, but it 
is actian I and anly actian

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Budget: Students shouldn't suffer in 
sudden fee increases for state's benefit 

contrnued from page 4 
sounds Itke a lot, but the universi-
ty raised fees by a whopping 15 7 
percent dunng the last budget cri-
sis, only to cut fees a few year 
later. 

\ \ 11en a budget predicament of 
uch magnitude occurs, students 

should expect to be affected. Yet 
with an 11.1 percent increa e 
freshly Implemented, tudents will 
no doubt be more than wary of 
another substantial hike so soon . 
A smarter way ro compensa te for 
cuts would have been to gradually 
raise fees, generating more cover-
age without such a shock. 

Luckily, the state says low-
II1come and financial aid students 
will not be affected much with 
help from other tudents' fee 
increases and other sources. 
However, for tho e not in univer-
sity, state or fede ral programs, the 
$ I ,200 fee increase IS stilI an 
oppressively large amount to dig 
up. 

More importantly, reductions 
in areas that directly affcct stu-
dents student se rvi ces, 
libraries, etc. - will arguably 

" A smarter way to com, 
pensate for cuts would 
have been to gradually 

raise fees I generating cov, 
erage without such a 

shock." 
impact them even more if the 
buget is approved. It will be diffi-
cult for the university to continue 
to deliver its world-renowned 
education with the unavoidable 
and obligatory layoffs, research-
funding cutS and other drastic 
reductions. 

Davis is not a greedy hench-
man seeking to cheat mi ll ions of 
students out of precious educa-
tions. By no means can the univer-
sity escape from the state and 
nationwide dilemma that is a sad 
fact of reality. Schools shouldn't 
expect to be immune from an eco-
nomic slump. However, the gov-
ernor's approach to solving the 
state fiscal problem, especially 
pertaining to higher education, 
seems to somewhat disregard the 
impact that such repetetive bud-
get slashing would have on stu-
dents, professors and re earch . 

On the bright side, the budget 
will continue to be scrutinized 
heavily until the legislature 
approves it, a process that's bound 
to generate discussion on whether 
or not the schools will actually see 
their budgets cut. Until then, stu-
dents can sit tight and treasure 
what may be, at least for awhile, 
the prime day of a stili-preemi-
nent university. 

The Guardian is always hiring writers, illustrators, 
copy readers and designers.

Sex, intrigue and society are examined in this exceptional play 
t all appeared to be wis-
dom and beauty and ... 
enchanrlllcn t," stammers 

Lord Alfred Douglas while recount-
ing his first meeting with Oscar 
\Vi lde. Throw a little tragedy Int the 
miX, and you have "Gross Indeccncy: 
The 3 lrials of Oscar v lide," the lat-
est play presented by San Diego's 
Divcrsionary T heatre. The city' only 
gay and lesbia n thearer is well known 
for putting on excellcnt plays, and 
does not fail to deliver in this new 
production. 

Focusing on the persecution of the 
popular British author and poet, 
"Cross Indecency" is a fascinating 
commentary on society'S reaction to 
homosexuality. Men the first trial 
begins, Wilde is England 's reigning 
author with two triumphant plays on 
the West End stage. Three months 
and three trials later, Wilde is con-
victed of sodomy, and his career and 
life are in ruins. The prod uction pro-
vides a searing look at the grinding, 

re lentless crush of English bureaucra-
cy while it puts \ Vilde's very art on 
trial. 

The playwright, MOlses Kaufman, 
docs an exceptional job of revealing 
the hypocrisy and narrow-minded-
ness of the British government, as 
well a bnnging to light Wilde's bril-
liant way with words and hiS commit-
ment to an and beauty. T he majority 
of Kaufman's text is taken from the 
book "The Three Trials of Oscar 
Wilde," compiled by H . 
Montgomery Ilyde from shorthand 
note frolll the trials. The trial 
excerpts are interspersed with per-
sonal biographies, unpublished mem-
oirs, journalistic accounts of the trials 
and Wilde's own writing, giving the 
audience a glimpse into both the 
public and private life of one of 
England's greatest playwrights. As a 
result, "Gross Indecency" is more 
t113n just a borinIT play set in a court-
house and full of judicial jargon - it 
comes alive with a fabulous cast and 

an unconventional way of story-
telling. 

The small, intimate attnosphere 
and dimmed house lights of the 
Diversionary Theatre draws the audi-
ence into what has been described as 
the trial of the 19th century. Wilde, 
played perfectly by Farhang Pernoon, 
is being persecuted by his lover's 
father, the eighth Marquess of 
Queensbury, for "posing as a 
sodom' te." Standing in a corner with 
an outraged expression is Angelo 
O'Agostino-Wilimek, beautifully cast 
into the role of Lord Alfred Douglas, 
Wilde's lover. Throughout the per-
formance, his passion and emotional 
outbursts keeps the audience on the 
edge of their seats with a sense of 
mourning for this doomed couple. 

Despite the heavy subject matter, 
Pernoon keeps the atmosphere light 
with his witty comments. "Here was a 
brilliant man who knew how to dazzle

Rock on: Daniel of Ozma enthUSiastically plays gUllar

No, it's not 
Weezer; it's 

Ozma that will 
play at the Pub 

AS. Buzz series brings the 
perfect college band promis-

ing a killer show of more 
than just Weezer covers 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is said that imitation is the best fornl of flat-
tery, but sometimes this works both ways \I hen 
an up-and-coming band earns companson to 
well-established artists. At times, over-comp.m-
on can kill the musical offspring, but whlie the 

members of pop/rock band Ozma JIlJy be 'ilek 
and tired of hearing themselves be compJft!d to 
vVeezer, the parallels drawn arc warranted, Jnd 
in this case, those credentials are a good thlllg 

The Pasadena, ali f., band that has learned 
from the greats - unsurpri ingly haVIng toured 
with the likes ofWeezer and ada lIrf (of wlllch 
they sound like the perfect genetic crossing) -
will be playing at the tage on Jan. 31 as part of 
the A.S.-sponsored Buzz cries. 

"They're jU!>t a perfect college band," said 
Assistant Programmer ean Mandel-Toren, 
explaining that he booked Ozma after the band's 
name was repeatedly suggested by UC 0 ~tu­
dents as a potential Buzz invitee, following in the 
footsteps of bands ugarcult and Eek-A-Mousc 
during full quarter. 

Ozma, several of whose members attend 
UCLA, epitomizes everything that a c lIe~ 
band should be: sentimental yet catchy, pop yet 
rock, earnest yet not overly serious. Ozma 
educes Ii teners with their foolproof fo rmula for 

emotional, hook-filled anthem. 
Members of the band came together III J 

manner befitting their generation and credo, 
earching AOL member profi le as teenagcr~

THURSDAY, JANUARY 30. Z003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN IIIATUS II 

OlMA: Dynamic singers lead band 
continued from page 9 

the lyrical content of the songs. 
Ozma uscs three vocalists (Daniel 

Brummel, Jose Galvez and Ryen Slcgr), and 
one very talented keyboardist (Star Wick), 
who adds nicely to the layered sound walls of 
the guitarists, all combining together to weave 
in and out of sof1: melodics to hard-hitting 
hooks and back again. The lyrics, with forced 
rhymes touchingly adding to the band's sense 
of earne tness, explore recurrent themcs of 
lost first lovcs and wonderments of their past 
youth (and since this is a college-aged bWlch, 
we're talking from high school back down all 
the way to elementary school here). These 
themes are not earth-shattering in their origi-
nality, perhaps, but with such idealistic and 
passionately sung lines as, "Every night 1 see a 
shooting star/T'm wondering if it's landing 
where you are/if you can see then you can't be 
far," or, "an apple tree/a family treelWill plant 
us together/and the roots will hold forever and 
forever," listcntrs are left feeling convinced 
that a little emotion can indeed go a long way. 
After all, this is a band who devoted an entire 
song to actress Natalie Poronan, daydreaming 
about whether or not she feels lonely and spcc-

ulating, "If I'm a proper Jewish boy, will her 
family love me?" 

Other song themes range from recollec-
tions of moving the Ouija board pointer in the 
ninth grade to thinking about the distance 
between loved ones while sitting duough an 
airplane flight. While all the songs are intro-
spective and emotionally bare, dle musical 
pace fluctuates wildly. One moment soft, the 
odlcr pounding down widl electric guitars, 
07ma's soundscapes manage to blend the 
incredible catchiness of pop-powered garage 
band approaches to the emotional drawn-out 
epic style in the grand tradition of Weezer's 
"Only In Dreams," oFF of their self-titled debut 
album. Songs of this length are incredibly risky 
for a pop-driven band, yet Ozma pulls it off in 
style thanks to a balance between engaging 
lyrics and well-crafted, layered harmonics. 

Since Ozma managed to land a spot open-
ing for Weezer based olelyon the quality of 
their live sets, it should be safe to listen to 
Ozma's fans who say that the band turns out a 
great show. The show is 18 and over, and 
doors open at 7 p.m. on Jan. 31 at the Stage. 
Tickets are $5 for students and $7 for general 
admission. 

Indecency: Oscar Wilde's trials 
continued {rom page 9 

and provoke with language," said director 
Rosi na Reynolds. "Not since heridan has a 
playwright so effectively held a mirror up to 
society and encouraged the members of that 
society to laugh at themselves." 

This droll quality is present in nearly all 
of Wilde's responses and comments, espe-
cially whi le in the courthouse. He presents 
himself as a very strong, confident, nearly 
smug man who has no need to answer to any-
one. During cross-examinations, he answers 
every question with a rhetorical onc, rarely 
ever giving 3 clear response. 

I lavi ng becn given the role of the JUry, die 
audience is involved in the play from the very 
beginning. In Wildes numerous discourses 
about the interconnectedness of beauty, life 
Jnd art, it is impossible even for the most 
uninterested audience member to not feci 
en lightened or, at the very least, provoked 
into deepl)' dlin1ung abollt such abstract 

,,~ues. \,vilde's hriliiuncl' is dlat within his 
witty hanter, seriou I~sues are addressed

It is tragic to see how invincible the famous 
author feels in the courthouse, perhaps 
because he is at the peak of his popularity. 
Until his arrest, Wilde strongly (and very 
vocally) upholds the belief that he is entitled 
to lead a life of his choosing without having 
to apologize for it, or worse, hide it. 

Most of all, "Gross Indecency" is a mas-
sive social commentary about 19th century 
England. The play is imbucd widl a sen e of 
hypocrisy at every level. Gay men with whom 
\Nilde had brief affair volunteer to speak 
against the author, claiming that they were 
raped or bribed into spending timc with him. 
It i not surprising that double standards in 
politics are also a major factor leading to 
\ Vilde's verdict. Until the trial, England 
chose to turn a blind eye to the alleged num-
ber of homo exual men III the Liberal Party. 
With the trial being followed by almost every 
household, the prime minister tllreatens to 
remove the Liberal Party if the author is 1I0t 
found gui lty. In tim respect, it is clear why 
\,\Iillie becomes .1 scapegoat of the homo cx-
ual communi ty, along with a government

THE U 0 GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2003 

For your info: Even Jesus hales Creed 
Diligently await the day when the worst bands will bother no more 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Rinaldo Dorman 

Nothing beats the vindication of watching a loud-mouthed, self-righteous band fall 
apart , or even just go away and no 
longer have rhei r pa thetic songs 
plaguc the radio. YOll know the 
feeltng: You can't understa nd why 
an),one would bother to go out 
and purchase such a tea ming pile 
of dog crap, let alone how there 
are eno ugh people behind the 
band to warrant a line of hit sin-
gles and wide-se ll ing albums, not 
to mention expensive and boring 
MTV video . How is it that the 
worst stations in town seem to 
play them endlessly, waving a ban-
ner of counter-credibility? Are 
they worried an uninformed lis-
tener might turn it on and, for a 
brief moment, think they found 
something worth listening to? I 
gleefully await the day that some 
of our current bands will disap-
pear, along with those albums that 
are currently selling better than 
porn to desperate computer 
geeks. 

Everyone has a band tha t is the 
bane of their musical existence; I 
have a friend who can't refrain 
from calling P.O .D . "pod" and 
laughing maniacally at how 
moronic she finds them. For 
many people toda y, that band is 
Creed. I went and asked several 
friends who they detested and 
wanted to see go away, and of 
course the resounding answer was 
Creed. Some came up with boy 
bands; others, pop stars trying to 
rock out; but always, and I mean 
always, there was a loathing for 
Creed. 

\Nho else can symbolize every-
thing that is wrong with pop 
music today? They started out 
humbly enough, being written off 
by critics as just a derivative of 
grunge wirh nothing new to offer. 
But then our little crappy band 
went and grew up, and slid further 
and further into mediocrity. Lead 
singer Scott Stapp started wearing 
wife-bea lers exclusively, guitarist 
Mark Tremonti must have gone to 
"tuff school" with all the postur-
ing he started doing ... and I think 

there were a couple.of other guys 
who got little-to-no camera time. 

Sure singles like "Arms Wide 
Open" (no, not even a song about 
having your first child is safe from 
being mocked) and "My Sacrifice" 
were doubly painful because they 
were not only crappy songs, bur 
videos as well . But the thing that 
is rea lly lame about Creed is their 
elf-comparison s to Led Zeppelin . 

l·or those of you who don't 
know, Lcd Zeppeli n was not well 
received by cntics for a long tllnc. 
In fact, some of their mystique 
came from the pre>s ' disdain for 
the grouJl, whIch caused Zeppelin 
to rarely do interVi ews at ,I II , leav-
II1g the fans to connect with the 
group mainly through musIc. The 
group also managed to c raft 
albums that were dynamic, differ-
ent from each other and rich in 
musical genius. 

While Creed has seen wide 
sales and popularity, their four 
albums have been a journey of 
mainstream acceprabiliry, pander-
ing to whatever meets the widest 
sales. There has been little musi-
cal development or stretching of 
boundaries; often their albums are 
sa id to have the same virtues - or 
perhaps more accurately, follies-
each time around. 

Inc identally, being a Christian 
band with obviously Christian-
rhemed lyriCS but not having the 
gall to come out and admit your 
stance is seriously weak, toO, 
while we are on the subjects. 

Until the day come, when CD 
resale stores are inundated wi th 
once-owned copies of 
"Weathered" or "Human Clay," I 
will take refuge in the already-
defunked and slap-able groups 
disappearing into the haze of the 
'90s. 

The most obvious category of 
music to have the coffin nailed 
shut would be rapcore, or rap-
metal, what with the most notable 
of the genre going the way of the 
buffalo. Korn is moving away 
from their earlier sound, Rage 
Against The Machine has split, 
and other groups have fallen off 
the pop radar scope all together. 
The second-rate (hed}p.e. (Who 
could never decide what their 
name meant - was the PE short 
for Planet Earth, or JUSt PE? 
Depends on which week you 
asked them) have been silent, 
much to my delight, ever sin e 
their lone single, "Bartender," 

faded away back in 2000. 
T he group that really makes 

me happy to have met with inter-
nal troubles is Limp Bizlcit, who, 
for my money, stood as a figure -
head of stupid bands, thanks in a 
large part to their lead si nger, 
Fred Durst. I know a lot of kids 
were into this group, bllt serious-
ly, I didn't know how much longer 
I could take Durst going on like 
he was something special. In rhi, 
cy ni c's opi nio n, gu itari,t \ Ves 
Borland deserves an award for 
leaving the ba nd and moving o n 
to other projects. 

Since Borland's departure , 
Limp Bizkit held open gU it ar 
auditions, fou nd no one, reopcned 
the position, and finall y demled 
to beg and grovel for Borland ro 
return by aslcing fan to e-mail 
their desire to see the guitarist 
reunite with the res t of the band . 
I Iumorously enough - and to the 
glee of "haters" and critics every-
where - Borland has turned 
down the offer to focus un hi s 
own project, Eat The Day. In fa ct, 
he has gone a tep further, threat-
ening Durst that Borland's riffs 
can't work thei r way onto a 
talked-about new album for the 
Limp crew. YCt since they are 
laclcing their most interesting 
member (in visual terms, if noth-
ing el e) and only guitarist, the 
band will have to rely on bass ist 
Sam Rivers doing double duty 
with some SOrt of assistance fro m 
Durst as well. 

Honestly, I'm excited about 
this; a an admitted hater, I look 
forward to the opportuniry of see-
ing a once explosively popll iar 
group stumble and fall thanks to a 
pompous megalomaniac of a 
vocalist who must think the band 
can go on no matter what. 

In a fitting bout of irony, Durst 
and Stapp have been known to 
exchange words on each other's 
bands, and whose was worse. So 
now we have one half of the >uck 
exchange down for the count. And 
the other? Well, we can all just 
walt , hope and do our part by 
refu ing to let our friends and 
family members waste their hard -
earned money on bands like 
Creed (who has been nominated 
for worst album of the year with 
"Weathered") or any of myriad of 
worthIes, forgettable and down -
right boring bands that not even a 
VHl "Behind the Music Special " 
could make seem interesting.

Jason Mraz: The crooning

Acoustic performer Mraz will showcase his

One minor drawback in watch-
ing thi play i that it is slightly 
confusing durtng the first half. It is 

intended to give the background of 
Wilde's life and all the details lead-
ing up to the trials. There are a lot 
of fact and statements being 
thrown around, so although it 
might be difficult to really under-
stand what is going on; keep in 
mind that everything will come 
together beautifully in the end. 
The disjointed nature of the play, 
\\'itll numerou narrative, personal 
biographies ane journalistic 
accounts, only adds to its uncon-
ventional quality and enjoyability. 

Overall, the production is very 
intro pective and entertaining. The 
tremendous emotions involved in 
the perform:lI1ce are captivating, 
\\'hile the intimacy of the 
Diversionary Theatre is a huge 
draw. Be sure to reserve your tick-

Blind Boys 
will bring 

their gospel 
They may be old, but 
they can still deliver 
their unique sounds 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Fifty records, one Broadway 
show and no less man 60 years after 
meeting at me Alabama Institute for 
the Negro Blind in 1939, the 
Grammy Award-winning, gcnre-
bending Blind Boys of Alabama arc 
bringing meir version of the gospel 
to a university near you. 

The Blind Boys kicked off a year-
long international tour last week that 
will make SlOpS at a dozen U.S. cam-
puscs, including our very own 
UCSD on Feb. 5. At first glancc, the 
college circuit might seem an ill -
advised choice of venue for a group 
composed primarily of blind, gen-
atric go pel ingers. But men again, 
me Blind Boys are fa r from your tra-
ditional gospel ensemble. 

Thc Blind Boys' brand of 
gospel , though still rooted in hym-
nal tmdition, owes equal parts to 
modern R& B, blues and rock 'n' 
roll. It is exactly this combination 
of the traditional and the contem-
porary tha t has won the Blind Boys 
noturtcty mil ide the nallon' stan-
danl gospel CIrcles.

"t\ma7ing ,race" sung to the minor 
melody of the traditional "Hou!>c of 
the Ri~ing lIll," which won the 
hrrouP spots on late-night televiSIon, 
but limited radio play. 

The album peaked at 0. 42 on 
illllboard's Ileatscekers Chart, an 
illlpre,sive showing for a gospel 
record . Furthermore, the B1l11d

Snyder IS I"M olle of ,cven true

" lIe is a greJt, unselfish player 
and ha, a good understJnding of 
the g.lltle," Zanolli said. "II IS 
!:ood to be a part of a group of 
frc.hmcn who share a passion for 
the gamc and can rurn the pro-

Bcing the most successful of the

say, his greatest strength IS hts 
"versa tility, [hel can play post or

THURSDAY 
JANUARY 30, 2003 

A s~ranBe 
vOice IS 

eventually 
ignored 

Pum's 
Points 

Anu Kumar 

W hen I took the podium at the Glio/'dIOIl tall meeting on Jan. 1 to 
ralk about sports IITltlllg, I heard a 
loll' voice that seemed to come 
dOll'n from up above, from some 
being that was lookIng over me. 

"Take off rhe hat," the vOice 
31d. 

The words took me by surprise. 
"Why'" I asked my elf. "Do 

these other writers I'm about to 
'teach' really find it disrespectful 
for me to be wearing a hat at the 
frOnt of a lecture hall?" I 1I'0n-
dered. 

I qUickly figtJred the chance of 
that were slim to none. 

Then I thought that maybe It 
\\ as because they wanted to be able 
to ec my face 'a little better (I've 
been told that I have "beauuful 
hrown eyes"). 

And then J realized the actual 
rea,on. On my hat wa the Raiders' 
logo, which - after their Super 
Bowl embarrassment - looks as 
unlllunudatlng as a 5'6", 150-
pound linebacker lookIng to put a 
hit on a runl11ng back. 

It was a shame the way the 
Silver and Black failed to keep 
thclr commitment to excellence 
agaJJ1st ChuckIe and the Bucs, but 
I'm not gOlllg to leave the Raider 
:-..'allon ()'.'ernlght. I'm not gOlllg 
to take off my hat, like so many 
other people Jumplllg off the 
handwagon , JUSt hecause my team 
Imt. 

And ~o thc hat was readjusted to 
make ,ure C\'ervone III the room 
took nouce, and I began my short 
pre,elll,ltlOn. 

\lthough I don 't hear the 
Raldcr~ ' theme ong III my head 
II hen I pu t on the ha t a fter the 
10\, In ~uper Bowl XXXVII, I'll 
(,nllnUe to wear Il throughout 
the ~prIng and , ummcr, and walt 
unlll next lime. (I ha\'e a bad b :l-
Ill/{ that It 'S gom/{ to be a long 
wait. ) 

It hurt, to ~ee a fan put on hl ~ 
"favorIte" team '> Jcrscr bClf;,e J 
game, and thcn, afte; the team 
~putters through a IO,lIlg streak 
Jnd slIlks in the standlllg~, takcs Jl 
off and replaccs Il wltl) the new 
fim-place squad, which becomcs 
the fan 's ncw "faVOrite" team. 

I'll wear my Jersq dUring a 
team's champiomhlp parade 
through thc streets, throughout 
the race for the lottery pick, and 
then I'll be the first one with It on 
(because It never came off) when 
the team finally SitS atop the stand-
1I1g', 

If I was embarrassed to repre-
sent my team after a loss, I would 
have taken off my UCSD hat a 
long time ago (and who knows 
when I would put it on again). But 
that's not the case. I have my 
UCSD hat on today, and I'll have 
it on the next time the men's bas-
ketball team gives up a record 
number of three-pointers to an 
opponent, and I'll still have the 
Tri ton colors on when , if ever,

Tritons set for youngsters in Mexico 
UCSD worn n's volleyball helps build court at elementary school 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

Members of the women's vol-
leyball team went to Grupo, 
Mexico, and helped install an 311-
purpose POrt Court valued at 

I -,000 in an elementary school 
III December. The Triton were 
helping a non-profit organization 
called tarlings, whose goal is to 
allow low-income, inner-city girl 
to play volleyball. 

"\\'e were all real inspired by 
the kIds; they were helping and 
were all full of SIlules," said 

CSD head coach Duncan 
McFarland. 

McFarland is a long-time 
friend of Starlings Director Byron 
Shewman, and when Shewman 
told McFarland about this oppor-
tunity, he jumped at the chance. 
Joining McFarland and Shewman 
were UCSD Athletic DirectOr 
Earl Edwards, women' volleyball 
assistant coach tacy Tongg, and 
two of the women' volleyball 
player, Katie I logan and Denelle 
Smalley. 

"My only regret is that I 
couldn't get more girls down 
there," McFarland ald . "The 
only day we could go down to 
help was the fir t Monday of 
final." 

Part of the reason for this being 
the only possible day the team 
could help wa becau e of all the 
delays that took place: The port 
Court was delayed both in Its 

delivery date and in customs. 
Shewman and McFarland went to 
Grupo on a day they thought the 
court would arrive, but even when 
it didn't, they made the most of 
their time 'at the elementary 
chool. 

"\Ve were so impressed by all 
the people there, they are coming 
from such poor neighborhoods 
- some literally living in shacks 
- but all the kids had their 
school uniforms on and were 
ready to learn. They were all so 
disciplined and re pectful; they 
really looked like they were able 
to block out their living condi-
tions and make school the high-
light of their days," McFarland 
said. 

The kids at the chool were not 
the only ones to benefit from the 
court or the experience, though ; 
the principal of the school decided 
that because the school belongs to 
the community, then so does the 
COurt. 

"I wanted the team to see what 
conditions are like there," 
McFarland said. "It's a real educa-
tional experience." 

UCSD's partnership with 
Starling will continue on May 
10, when it will host a fund-rais-
ing dinner and silent auction. On 
June 19 through June 22, UC D 
will play host to the Starlings 

adona I Tournament, and with a 
little luck, one of the teams from 
Starling's Mexican program will 
be there.

Couttesy of UCSD

Adam Snyder 
UCSD men's 

basketball forward 
entered Rocklin High School, 
Snyder made the deciSIOn to qUit 
football and eventually decided to 
concentrate all hjs efforts on bas-
ketball. 

This commitment to the sport 
landed Snyder on the Triton men's 
basketball team. 

"It's tough to come into one of 
the few D-2 schools Without 
scholarships, but the outstandmg 
academics and location make it 
worth it," Snyder said about his 
deci ion to attend UCSD. 

Snyder has learned that the 
move from high school to college 
ba,ketball reqUire a great amounr 
of adjusting. 

"The pace of the game is a lot 
qUicker and the phYSical strength 
of player IS qUite different; )'OU 
have to learn to play ag:lJnst men," 
Snyder said. 

- bny college spons teams are 
known to hazc their freshmen, 
makmg thc fir t year of college 
e\l:n harder. Snyder has noticed 
thiS I> not the ca e With the UCSD 
ba,ketball program. 

"Bemg a freshman here is not 
hard," nyder said. "I,,\'c have to do 
emuarra,smg things all 11l fun, and 
the guys are great at giving up 
when I do somctrung wrong." 

Fcllow freshman Zach ZanollJ 
has also appreciated the envJr()J1-
llIent that the experienced player 
prOVide for thc freshmen . 

"Thc btUy, are grcat; there IS no 
hazmg and it has been an enjoy-
able experience," he said. 

Triton head coach Greg 
LanthIer has been as impressed 
with Snyder'S performance as 
Synder is impressed with the 
Triton program. 

"Most true freshmen are incon-
sistent," Lanthier said. "Adam has 
tremendous ability which already 
shows, and he has a bright future." 

Additionally, Snyder has gained 
the respect of his older teammates. 

"He is one of the better fresh -
men, and shows it in practice by 
working hard," said UCSD's Sean 
Crawford. 

Snyder posts Stats that back up 
the approval from his coaches and 
tearrunatcs; he completes 46.9 per-
cent of his shots, and the 6' 6" for-
ward averages eight points per

game. Additionally, he is third on 
the team with 83 rebounds for the 
year. 

Even with these Stats, Snyder is 
not satisfied. 

WI would like to personally 
average 10 points and seven 
rebounds per game, and raise my 
free-throw average," he said 

Snyder makes these personal 
goals with the hopes Wt they will 

help with the ultimate goal of 
"bringing more wins to th e 
team." 

Each game, Snyder prepares to 
work toward his goals, and even 
his pre-game ritual is a little differ-
ent than most others,
