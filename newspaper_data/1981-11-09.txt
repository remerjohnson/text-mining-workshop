Time to listen 
The Associated tudent Council ha certainly 

attracted a lot of student interest thi year. With the 
celebrated Coors and Nes tle boycotts, the 
Chancellor ' inauguration, a renewed attack on the 
Committee for World Democracy Film Serie ,the A . 
ha attracted a flurry of s tudent opin ion both 
:J pporting and opposing their deci ion,. The level of 

emotion is high on both sides of each issue, a nd an air 
of ten ion and mi s trust is developing among the 
member of the Council. 

The latest round of controversy began two weeks 
ago when A Commi ioner of Activity Fee, David 
Tollner, publi . hed a letter in the UCSD Guardian 
attacking the AS on their tands on the above i ues. 
He called a meeting "open to the general tudent 
body" to garner upport for his drive to cut the CWD 

. budget. Approximately 50 s tudents attended 
Tollner's meeting, and a a result , the AS Council 
heard two hours of tudent input the following 
evenmg, 

Since that time, the Guardian has received a large 
number of letters commenting on Tollner' petition 
drive, and the AS in general. The number of opinions 
supporting the AS and the CWD have been about 
equal to the number attacking them, 

The real issue is not simpl y whether the CWD film 
serie. deserve '12,500 when other tudent 
organizatiom are suffering form budget cuts. The 
is. ue i. not whet her the cwn attracts 400 people 
every week and serves as a link to the San Diego 
Community, The issue that the A must recognize i 
that there is an alternati\'e set of opinions on what the 
AS funding and political g03 ls s hould be. 

CSD is frequently labeled as "an apathetic 
campus," where students don't really care about the 
AS, th world around them, the important is. ues at 
hand, Without any degree of student guida nce, theA 
has had to 3ddress the issues it thought were 
important to students, as e\'idenccd by the activist 
stance of many student leaders. Now, after too long a 
time, those "apathetic students" are making their 
voice heard, They are saying. "I want my act i\-ity fee: 
spent primarily on student organizations. I want 
more AS programming," 

We must be carefu l not to place current AS policies 
in mutual exclusivity with Tollner's object ions. But 
the AS is finding a segment of the student body 
coming out and getting involved with their decis ion-
making process, T o be a truly repre entative body, 
the AS has a respon ibility to li s ten clo ely,

Gays: politician's toys 
Last month, primetime 
tele'vi~iol1 dchuted its first 
homosex ual hero, S\'dne\ 
Shorr, To (lur surpnse, the 
nation didn't freak ou t. 

Actor Tony Randall' s 
port ra ya l of a lo nel y, 
sometimes selfi sh midd le-aged 
man, in fact. became a regular 
Wednesday night feat ure on 

BC on Oct. 28. 
Though the word "homo-

exual" mentioned during the 
serie, it's generally agreed 
that Sydney is rtifferent from 
other male leads. 

Whil e Am er ica took 
Sydney's "coming out" in 
stride, it mav not mean times 
have changed. Too man y 
politicians can st ill make a 
li\'ing baiting homosexuals. 

In Florida. for exanwle. the 
state legis lature recently 
enacted a .Iaw that all but 
eliminated "tudent groups 
which offlcrallv aid, counsel. 
organi7e or \velcome homo-
<,exual,> . The law's co·author 
told our associate . 1ichael 
Duff\', that the bill was 
deSIgned to keep ga~' ,> off 
college ·amplIses. 

"We\e got a scn.'re problem 
in Florida," ~aid State Alan 
Trask . "I/omosexualit v isn'l

Trask teamed up \\ ith

When the ~t'ho()1 refused to 
recogni7c the group, the 
student app('a led to Ihe state 

and \Von . Hut th('n the 
legislator~ ~tepped in . 

Waving C()L1r~l' cat alogul'~ 
from Florida Sta te LTniver'iitv, 
Trask told his colleagues that 
such nOll-credit universitv 
co ur ses as "Gay Rap 
Sessions" and "Lesbian Rap 
'ess ion '" weren't in the 

. tate' interest. 
Trask pus hed through an 

amendment to th annual 
budget prohibit ing tate aid to 
colleges or univer 'ities which 
fund, recognize or give 
meeting space to any student 
group which advocates 
.. 'ex ual re lations between 
persons not married to each 
oth r." 

The law is so broad that it 
threatens to put ,most sexual 
information cent rs, \\,omen's 
groups and student cou nseling 
and referral organizations out 
of business Oil college 
campu,>es. 

Indeed, Ihe law suffiCl nth' 
up~et the l Jniversily of South 
Florida 's student go\' rnment 
t hat its delegates officially 
"endorspd" ..,exua l inlercour"e 
in an effort to pro\'oke an aid

Like the thou:>ands of 
\\omen's healt h center~ wh ich 
have proliferall>d Oil college 
campus s during t he last 10 
years, homosexua l nghts 
groups are nothing intolerable, 
Nearly 30 percent of private 
coli ges and 80 percent of 
public univ rsit ies recognize 
such groups. Meanwhile, only 
2.7 percent prohibit them, 

Strong opposition, however, 
may not reverse the Florida 
legislators' wisdom, Gov, Bob 
Graham confesses he onlv 
signed the bill b 'ause a veto 
would have killed the entire

CWD films series serves entire community 
Editor: 
We were very sad to learn that 
a small group of stud nt!> it-, 
attempting to pressure the AS 
Council into dropping its 
support for the Comm ittee for 
World Democracy's politica l 
film series, Th!ie students 
claim that $12,500 is too much 
money to be given to a single 
student organization, and that 
the film series it self appea ls to 
a limited number and narrow 
range of st udents, 

Th last charge is . imply 

not true. We can not readilv 
think of another AS-supportl.(J 
event which attracts severa l 
hundr d student s each we k 
for three full quartel s, And 
when it comes to the ,' 12,500 
bing too mu 'h, we must 
interject: too much for wha t? 
Consider: not onl y do several 
hundred s tud nts e these 
film s ach Fridayev ning, bUI 
they st' th em for free. 
Further, as Jules Bagncns has 
pOInted out, the fJlm '>eries 
"erve ... the en tire community 

- faculty, s tudents, staff. and 
any locai resident who has iln 
interest In thc film. The film 
... ene ... is also an {'ducational 
event : it is a valuable teaching 
and learning resource whi'h is 
used by many facu l ty 
members, and which no 
program or d partment on 
campus could come close to 
being able to support . These 
films arc not genera ll y 
avai lab le in Sail Diego : 
wit hout t h(' film series. most 
of u~ \\mild newr hav the 

chance to see them , 
Final ly, lhe~e film s are 

\Joilt ical in t he broadest sense: 
th yare not simply about 
con temporary issues and they 
are not narrowly ideological. 
They are informative and 
cha llenging. B ause of the 
qualit y of the film s in this 
series, and because of the way 
thi s series hrings together so 
many diverse I cment~ of the 
uni\er~ l ty community, the 
Commilt 'e for World 
J)em ol'racy has added a 

va luable dimension to the 
cu ltura l ~c tting here, a 
dimension which otherwi se 
would ~ impl y not be pre~ent. 

We wan t to thank the A for 
its support of the political film 
series, and the CWD for its 
effort and imagination , It 
wou ld be a shamc if a few 
thoughtless studenls were 
a llowed to depri ve 1I ~ a II of 
something so valuable.

Atotnicafe practices censorship Revelle 
book 
exchange 

Editor: 
Some of the incidents 

surrounding my performance 
of my piece The Effects of Ether 
011 th l! Human Body on 
Tuesday night 's Atomicafe 
were reported by Daniel 
Lanneville in the la t issue of 
The Guardian (Nov. 5). I would 
like to make ome remarks on 
the art iele, 

As Mr. Lanneville pointed 
out, there wa some escape of 
fumes into the auditorium 
which caused two , pos ibly 
more, cases of "nausea and 
headache," one of them being 
one of the few people who left 
during the performance, This 
relea e of fumes was not at al l 
an intended part of the piece. I 
feel very st rongly against the 
imposit ion of one person's 

concept of acceptable risk through my neglig nce, I did 
upon another. r as ented to not know either. 
breathing the vapors, The The headline of the article, 
audience did not. I apologize to Ether incident causes director 
tho e who were made to feel to resign, and the gist of the 
any form of ph ys ica l article eemed to cite the 
di comfort. The piece was programming of my piece as 
fini shed at the very last the causes of the "nearly 
minute and was gross ly universal condemnation" of 
underrehear ed; and though I . Richa rd Bou langer's pro· 
tho ugh t I had t a ken gramming practice, I do not 
reasonable mea s ure s in wish to accept all the blame for 
protecting the audience from his resignation, In covering 
any fumes, the performance the more sensational aspects 
proved me wrong, of my performance , Mr . 

I accept full respon ibility L an nevil le completely 
for whatever happened . I overlooked another disturbing 
reiterate Mr , Lanneville's event. Though not announced 
comment that the Atomicafe in th e pre v iou s day's 
director, Richard Boulanger, Guardian, there was to be 
knew very little of what was performed a piece by the 
going to take place that author of the article: Daniel 
evening - and unfortunately, Lanneville , Jut before the 

start of the program, however, 
Lee Ray, Mr. Boulanger's chief 
assi tant, came before the 
audience and stated that Mr, 
Lanneville' pi ce had been 
purged from the program by 
the programming committee, 
of which Mr. Boulanger is the 
head , due to its total lack of 
artistic merit. 

In a s upposed ly free 
academic atmosphere, such 
cen orship is not only unca lled 
for, but absolutely unforgiv-
able. If anything is to be cited 
as cause for Mr. Boulanger 's 
condemnation , it i. thi act of 
cen orship, and not for 
permitting the performance of 
my piece, of which, as [ have 
already stated , he knew very 
little.

In regard to an article of two 

week ago which addre sed 
the issue of the possible AS 
takeover of the campus 
bookstore, and which listed 
Groundwork Book as the only 
alternative to the book tore, I 
wou Id like to correct the 
aut hor of that art ide, 

Student questions AS policies 

The Revelle Book Exchange 
(located across from Beagle 
Hall) has served as a viable 
alternative to the bookstore for 
thou and of tudent overthe 
years is has been 111 existence. 
It i a student·run operation 
and i in fact tocked by the 
students of thIS university (we 
operate on a con ignment 
basis ). The exchange 

Editor: 
As a typical student here 

at UCSD, I don 't get too 
excited about or involved 
in the happenings of 
running a university, but 
lately things have changed. 
After reading the past few 
Guardian issues and listen-
ing to the murmurs around 
campus, I decided that 
maybe this conflict between 
the AS Council and the rest of 
the world rendered a little 
looking into. I didn 't have to 
look very far, 

Concerning the big issue, 
CWD, a little digging arou nd 
opened up a few interesting 
fact s. Jules Bagneris and other 

CWD backers on the Council 
insist that CWD is not and was 
never meant to be a student 
organization, The proposed 
budget s from last year 
disagree. Jules, in his first 
budget , gave $67,600 to 
student orgs. Later he changed 
his mind and gaveonly $45,000 
to student orgs, , $10,000 to 
special programs, and $12,500 
to CWD. I don't know what 
kind of deal he made with 
CWD but the money they 
received came out of , the 
origina l student org. fund s. 
Very interesting. 

The next interestin~ trip I 
took 'was into Bagernis' trips. 
No other AS member has gone 

out of state with tudent 
funds, except when Jeremy 
Charlton and a couple of other 
AS members went to Eugene, 
Oregon , in a van last year, 
Jules is reall y getting around 
these days. First to Soda 
Springs, Idaho; then to 
Washington , D.C.; and then to 
Madison, Wisconsin, On each 
trip he went in order to bring 
back valuable information for 
improving UCSD. I don 't know 
where he is keeping it because 
he gave no report on any trip to 
either the AS or us as 
students. All he aid was that 
he found nothing concrete to 
report. That 's just great. Next 
thing you know he 'll be flying 

out to Nebraska for some more 
"valuable information ," 

While I'm thinking about it, 
I would like to bring up a very 
up etting story, La t spring 
quarter, a group of students 
(34) staged a sit-in in the 
Chancellor's office to protest 
Dr. Emory Tolbert's (History 
Dept. ) denial of tenure , 
Chancellor Atkinson warned 
them of arrest, they stayed, 
they were arrested , The 
"Tolbert for Tenure" issue 
was supported by les than 
half of the campus, but Jules 
" in our interest" told these 
people that they had the 
complete support of the AS. He

pecialize in cour e texts and 
offers an appreciable savings 
over bookstore prices. Though 
the Exchange hasn 't been 
adverti ed much over the 
years, we are beginning to do 
so and would welcome any 
offer of aid by the AS. Perhaps 
developing tho e student 
interest organizat ions which 
are already in existence would 
provide a more worthwhile 
challenge to the AS than 
wrestling with the admllli tra-
tion for something which is 
unattainable, a the campus

Caffeine hartnful Support for Atkinson 
Editor: 

I am writ ing in response to 
t he artic le on caffeine 
(Guardian, Nov . 6) . All 
summer , I worked in a 
psyc h iatry laboratory

[n theOctober26i ueofthe 

UCSD Guardian, there was an 
article on the inauguration of 
Chancellor Richard Atkin on. 
The article describes Jules 
Bagneri . ' protest again t the 
"unrepresentative" search 
process for a Chancellor. After 
making the speech about the 
AS dis pleasure with the 
present selection ystem, 
Bagneri walked out of the 
ceremony. 

Student should be able to 
have some say in who becomes 

Chancellor. However, [ feel 
Bagneris is hardly the one to 
talk about how people come to 
hold office: he became 
Pre ident oftheAS by default. 
Although it was a close race 

betw~n him and his opponent 
he, too, was not selected by a 
majority of students. 

The tudent hould not be 
opposed to Chancellor 
Atkinson . He had no choice in 
the matter of his selection. 
Instead of discrediting him, 
the students should support 

him and trive for bet ter 
r lations. In the long run the 
s tudents will benefit. Maybe 
when relations are improved, 
the Chancellor will work with 
the st udents to revi e the 
sy ·tem of election for future 
Chancellors. I agree with 
Rand y Hill' uggestion: if the 
student wish to be a power in 
campus life, they need to 
maintain their visibility - not 
walkout of, or boycott, a major 
academic ceremony. 

Andy Harrison 

Student investigation of current AS policies 
continued from page 3 
then ottered hi $1000 
discretionary fund to bail 
them out of jail (his advi ors 
told him this was not such a 
good idea , so it was not done). 
He sent university vehicles 
down to pick up these students 
from jail - without 

permission from anybody! I'm 
an athlete and if we staged a 
si t · in demanding better 
facilities and coaches and go 
ourselves thrown in jail , I can 
guarantee that when we 
walked out there would not be 
a university vehicle waiting to 
take us home. 

Jule is reallysteppingoutof 
bounds when he does things 
like this. He has only been in 
office since May and he has 
already pent over his $1000 
discretionary fund - but 
that's OK, he got another 
$1000 to play with. 

One more thing, what's thi 

boycott stuff? I don't support 
the boycott of either Coor or 
Nestle, and certainly not the 
inauguration of Chancellor 
Atkinson. I don 't think we 
should be told who to boycott 
and who not to. It is up to us to 
tell them th ey are our 
representatives and right now

nine different sources. When I

wrote the Buddhist Monk , 
Thich Nhat Hanh. "To burn 
one elf by fire is to prove that

It is clear that George Winne 
patterned hi immolation after 
the Buddhist monks who 
burned themselves to death in 
the streets of Saigon in 1963 in 
protest of the War, But it i not 
certain how deeply Winne was 

Dr. William McGill 
Former UCSD Chancellor 

Very little is known about 
George Winne's personal life, 
H is parents, who still live in 
the San Diego area, remain 
unwilling to discu their 
son's death. (In the hospital, 
the night of Winne's death, 
Mrs . George Winne said 
George rn was "too bright and 
too ensitive" for such an act. 
H is father was silent about the 
whole matter). 

George Winne III wa born 
April 2, 1947, The son of a 
retired navy captain, Winne 
grew up in a "not too strict" 
military household , according 

to Norman Misleh , a neighbor 
of Winne's parents who was 
babysat by George several 
time, Like many people who 
grew up in the 1960s, it seems 
that Winne's life took a dra tic 
change of direction when he 
enrolled in college, After a 
hort spell at the University of 

Colorado at Mines - where he 
was considere<l an outstanJ-
ing cadet in the ROTC 
program - George came to 
UCSD, According to Misleh , 
Winne lost his intere t in the 
sciences (organic chemistry) 
and changed hi major to 
ancient history, With these 
academic change, Winne 
began to develop an interest in 
the introspective, my tical 
aspects of the sixties, In fact at 
the time of his death, Winne 
was devoting a good deal of 
time at the Unicorn Bookstore 
in downtown La Jolla. a shop 
which pecializes in the elf, 
realization type of literature, 
He was reported to have 
become a vegetarian at the 
time of his death , 

Everyone who knew Winne 
applies the term "bright " to 
him, According to Misleh. 
Winne was classified as a 
"genius" by the ROTC 
program at UCM, 

"He was really a bright 
person," says Wayne Dick. "I 
remem ber one time he came 
over to my hou e and he would 
think the e thoughts that -
agree with them or not - they 
were shocking ideas," 

According to Professor 
McGill, Winne received a draft 
notice a few days before his 
suicide. 

* * * 

The Revelle College Council 
gave a hearing last May on 
whether to put up a George 
Winne memorial plaque on the 
Revelle Plaza, As a witne s, 
the council asked Normal 
Misleh , a UC D junior and a 
childhood friend of Winne's to 
speak at the hearing. 

"I have significant rea on to 
believe that the Vietnam war 
wasn't the only thing on 
George's mind," says Misleh . 

Atcording to Pam Gerber, 
External Relation Commis-
s ioner on the AS , Mi c; leh told 
the RCC that Winne had just 

"Our decision was to deny the 
reque t to put a plaque on the 
Revelle plaza partly on the 
grounds that we did not want 
to condone in any way what 
amounted to an act of violence 
Not to ay we are in protest of 
the intentions - or alleged 
intentions - but we didn 't 
want to in any way encourage 
that act to occur again ." Yee 
said, 

The Re velle College 
Council's decision rai e! an 
old question : hould George 
Winne 's immolatIon be 
memorialized? 

tThis guy (Winne) walks out in the 
Revelle Plaza with a sign protesting the 
war (and) kills himself in a way in which 
the Buddist monks had done it .... It was 
obvious why he did it. J Wayne Dick

Wayne Dick doesn't believe 

that Winne had girlfriend 
problem , 

"You must try to gauge 
the accuracy of a person who 
aw George a a baby itter," 

Dick aid, 
Misleh was only eight year 

old at the time of Winne 's 
death, but Mi leh ay he 
conferred with Winne's 
parents before the RCC 
hearings, 

Hoyt Yee, Chair on this 
year's RCC, ummed up the 
council deci ion last year: 

(Shortly after Winne's 
death, a memonal ite wa 
con tructed 10 an eucalyptu 
groye next to Central 
Undergraduate LIbrary. The 
memorial ite ha been 
vandalized since), 

Wayne Dick believe it 
should. "r reall v think it's a 
part of the hi tory of UC D It 
is. a much a anything, a

A study of Dostoevsky's major works. from his first novel. 
foor Folk to his last The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky 
was obsessed with contemporary politics, which he viewed 
in religious tenns. His vision of the era in which he lived 
was of a vast struggle between the forces of atheism in 
politics and the forces of Eastern Orthooox Christianity. 
His works will be studied in light of the historical. 
political. and theological issues which were of importance 
to him. For this reason. the reading list includes a small 
selection of writings by nineteenth century Russian 
political theorists. At the same time the course will 
examine the works of Dostoevsky as literary works of art. 
in order to discover the qualities of the author'S genius 
which enabled him to work his ideological conceptions 
into literary fonn. 
Reading list: 
Selected writings of IIelinsky. Cheryshevsky, and

In the early 1960's, Soviet literature underwent a renaissance, and formerly forbidden topics became the themes of 
controversial new worksoffiction. With the renewed repression ofthe I 970·s. many writers were driven into the ranks 
of the dissidents and eventually became exiles. This course will deal primarily with novelsand short stories published 
in the Soviet Union and abroad that renect the fresh perspectives characteristic of the best Soviet writers of the past 
two decades. Many of these works are remarkable for th eir frankness. Among the topics that will be discussed In class 
are the efforts of the so-<:alled "village writers" to present an unvarnished view of life in the countryside. the social 
malaises that beset Soviet intellectuals. and the stultifying and sometimes comical effects of the bureaucracy on 
day-to-11ayexlstence_ Some of the readings will include stories and novels by Vladimar Volnovlch. Yuri Trlfonov.

Undergraduates, graduates, 

and professors alike crowded 
into Garren Auditorium and 
Room 2100 (where it was on 
video) to hear Nobel prize 
laureate Paul Berg describe his 
work in mammalian genetics. 
(n 1967 when Berg was here at 
Salk Institute , he began to 
focus his attention on a major 
problem of eukaryotic 
genetics. Mammalian cells like 
those in our body belong to this 
class of cells called eukaryotes. 
Dr. Berg is concerned with 
introducing genes into 
mammalian cells in order to 
c reate novel cells and 
controlling those genes once 
they are there. 

Dr. Berg uses the genetic 
material of the V-40 virus to 
add new genes to a cell. This 
virus normally inserts its 
DNA into mammalian cells 
and expresses its genes to 
produce new virus. By use of 
restriction enzymes which cut 
the vi ra l DNA in very specific 
places, Berg and his colleagues 
have been able to remove the 
virus production genes and 
add in almost anv other gene. 
The DNA c an then be 
introduced into the cell and 
sometimes the gene i 
expre ed . Berg received the 
19 0 Nobel prIZe in Chemi try 
for the con truction and 
design of the e gene·carrying

Berg discusses 
DNA research 
continued from page 9 
fertilization could some day 
allow parents with genetic 
defects to have healthy 
children without these 
defects. We would then in 
some ways be taking evolution 
into our own hands. 

The changing or adding of 
traits in any type of cell is 
potentially dangerous and the 
con equences of adding genes 
to human cells are not fully 
understood. Dr. Berg was one 
of the first scientists to realize 
that safe guidelines for this 
type of research must be set up 
and so he and many other 
scientists in the field met at an 
historic conference at 
Asilomar in 1975. The results 

of that conference became the 
Nat ional Instit ute of Health 
guidelines for recom binant 
research . 

The techniques of adding 
genes to mammalian cells are 
fairly well defined, but the 
mechanisms by which these 
genes are expressed is much 
less understood. Dr. Berg 
addressed this quest ion by 
showing hi re earch on the 
control of various genes which 
he had inserted in mammalian 
cells. Various pieces of DNA 
have been shown to be 
necessary for the expression of 
certain genes, but no one truly 
understands how or why these 
pieces of DNA allow 
expression.

Lorber close to perfection 
BY TIM AUGUST 

Sla[( Wriler 
From the opening song 

"Galax ian" (the title cut from 
their latest album) to the 
standing ovation they received 
at the encore, The Jeff Lorber 
Fusion's concert last Friday 
night at Mandeville proves 
that they are indeed one of the 
great forces in contemporary 
fusion. 

Between the phenomenally 
tight execution of their 
material to the level of energy 
attained by their performance, 
the evening was an undeniable 
s uccess. 

The extensive use of multi· 
track production techniques 
on the last few albums of JLF 
were believed to oose a few 

problem for 't he live 
performance of the material. 
But Lorber played many of the 
horn and stri ng arrangements 
on his veritable battery of 
keyboards and synthesizers, 
and did it quite well. His use of 
these effects were used to their 
best advant~e on the tunes 
"Fusion Juice ' and "Spirit of 
the Moment." 

Lorber al 0 made use of a 
Moog Liberation synthesizer: 
a polyphonic keyboard 
synthsizer that is held and 
played much like a guitar. 
Although Lorber's perfor· 
mance with this device was 
exciting and exhibited his 
soloing abilities quite well, he 
seemed quite uncomfortable 
with it, as if he was not used to

the role he a umed u ing the 
Liberation: that of a guitar 
player. 

Besides Lorber's contribu· 
tions, the rest of the band was 
just as outstanding. Original 
members drummer Dennis 
Bradford , bassist Danny 
Wi Ison, and woodwind player 
Kenny Gorlick were all great. 
New addition, guitari t 
Morlon McLain was no less 
than hot. His tasteful use of 
electronic effects contributed 
well to his rock based tyle. He 
also added a surprisingly good 
soul vocal on "Think Back and 
Remember. " 

Bassist Wilson dazzled the 
audience with his flamboyant

SONOR opens '81 
season this week 
UCSD faculty group performs Wed. 

BY SID CORBETT 
On Wednesday evening, 

SONOR, UCSD' s faculty 
performance ensemble, will 
present a concert of twentieth 
century cia sics by the two 
major pupils of Arnold 
Schoenberg, Alben Berg and 
Anton Webern . Theen emble, 
described by New York 
Magazine as, " ... high 
adventure in their executIOn 
and wonderfully exciting," 
and by the Los A nge/es Times 
as performing, "a number of 
treacherou Iy difficult work 
(s ic) heroically ," is one 
primary rea on that ·tudents 
here can be very proud of the 
'1U ic department. 

It is, in fact , the accompli h· 
ments of thi group that the 
department's international 
reputation rests. So consider· 
able is this reputation t hat one 
occasionally hears Damstaad, 
Germany (a major European 
center for new music) referred 
to as the La Jolla of the ea t. 

Sonor was formed by its 
director of five years, Bernard 
Rand , in the fall of 1976. 
During his tenure as the 
group's conductor and music 
director, the group toured 
widely and received universal 
acclaim. 

Wednesday's performance 
will be something of a 
departure from traditional 
tenents of the ensemble, 
specifically the performance of 
contemporary American 

mu s ic, the mu . ic of our time 
and place . This concert 
present mu ic that i neither 
contemporary nor American. 
It is nonethele· a very 
important performance. [n a 
time when many audiences 
sti ll find part of travin ky's 
" Ie Sacre" jarring nearly 
seventy years after the 
premiere performa nce (in 
Paris in 1914), the group quite 
rightly feels the need to 
establish Important works of 
the early 20th century as 
cla sics, 0 that they may 
claim their r ightful place a 
vita l eleme n ts in the 
contemporary repetOlre. 

The e piece, by early 
German eriali . ts, were 
composed no later than 1935, 
yet to the listener who is not 
fully conversant with the 
trends of this centurv' music 
which have brought about the 
s harp break with traditional 
tonal harmony , even these 
now relatively tame works 
may eem quite difficult. But 
the group argues that these 
pieces form the foundation of a 
new mu ical ae thetic which 
must be assimilated if we are 
to effectively participate in the 
art and the culture of our 
modern time. 

The first half of the program 
will present several short 
pieces for en emble, chorus 
and solo voices by Berg and

DEL MAR. CA - The five 

luckiest fans at the opening 
day program of the inaugural 
eason of the Del Mar Harness 

Racing Association at the 
Del Mar Racetrack d idn 't 
merely win a big bet, they won 
the privilege of becoming 
"honorary" owners of a 
racehorse competing at the 
1981 harness meet. 

These five people, selected 
at random from the first 500 
that passed through the gates, 
were the Grand Prize Winners 
in the Del Mar 500 Drawing. 
Later this week, these five 
lucky fans will select a horse 
from a list of 20 pacers and 
trotters pre elected by Del 
Mar Harness Racing Secre· 
tary Robin Burn. The five 
winners will receive a check on 
December 19 (closing day of 
the racing meet) equal to the 
earnings of that hor e at Del 
Mar's 39·day harness ses ion. 

The Grand Prize winners 
are a mixed bag of personali · 
ties: 

Homer W. McWilliams (San 
Diego), age 50, arrived at Del 
Mar at 8 a.m. to be the 48th 
person arriving at the track. 
The retired real estate 
specu lator has never been to a 
harness race in his life and has 
on ly been a racing fan for two 
years. McWilliams came to the 
track specifically to enter the 
Del Mar 500. "I called my wife 
from the press box to tell her I 
won," he said, "a nd she 
wanted to know what bar] 
was calling from." 

Leo R. Schultz (El Cajon) 
age 64, is the oldest of th~ 
five winners. Schultz has been 
at tending horse races since the 
'40s and was at Del Mar in 
1949 when they last featured 
harnes racing, The reo

Charles "Chuck" Cargill 
(San Diego), age 38, had never

Gerald Lawrence (La Jolla). 
age 40, is the harne s pro of the 
group. Lawrence ha been 
attending harness races since 
high school. The owner of 
Twisteroos (pretzel shops) had 
planned to attend Del Mar's 
harnes races three to four 
times a week. His wife was at 
the track, det ermined to be one 
of the first 10 through the gate 
(she was number 11 5). 
Lawrence wa' the 219th 
person to arrive. 

Chris Spain (Solana Beach), 
age 22. is a senior at the 
University of California at San

Sonor Lorber concert

continued from page 13 
Webern . Particularly with 
Webern, ones attention should 
be drawn to the conci e, 
tightly knit structural design 
of the work. Dymaic (loudness) 
takes on thematic importance 
in his Klangfarben melodic 
style (a melody of timbres). 
Berg 's mu s ic, although 
similarly concise in design, 
exhibits a more lyric quality, 
and harmonic homogeneity, 
rather than disparity and 
harp contrast, in the case of 

Webern . 
After intermi sian, Sonor 

will perform Berg's Chamber 
Concerto for piano, and violin, 
with thirteen wind instru· 
ments. Department chairman 
Cecil Lytle will play piano, 
with Janos Negyesy on the 
violin. Thomas Nee, who this 
weekend conducted a fine 
performance of Beethoven's 
ninth symphony, will conduct 
the ensemble. 

I urge you to come and hear 
this performance, and to try 
and understand and appre-
ciate the beauty of this music, 
Times have changed, and our 
culture had radically evolved. 
Art has always preceded social 
change. It has now grown time 
for us to begin to catch up.

Clarke. Hi solo was so good 
the audIence was egging him 
on for more. 

Th e mo st animated 
performer was Gorlick who 
played mos tly tenor and 
soprano axophones. His 
soprano sax was fitted with a 
contact microphone and 
processed through a stack of 
electronic which definitely 
fattened up the sound of his 
instrument.

competition and we're looking 
forward to the match ups," 
said Dannevik. UCSD will 
play two more matches before 
the tourney, tonight against 
Point Loma College and again 
on Tuesday against Biola . 

Heroes? If you haven·t been 
to a game this year you don 't 
know what you're missing. 
The spirit of the UCSD 
Tritons is growing in the form 
of fourteen girls committing 
themselves to a lot of hard 
work and it is all paying off. 
Yes, you could say they are 
heroes.

Verde" and "Always There," 
"Tierra Verde," which is a cut 
off their upcoming album, 
represents yet another t urn in 
JLF's divergent brand of 
fusion . It was a mellow but 
very dynam ic piece that 
featured an inspiring sax solo 
which received quite an 
ovation from the audience. 
"Always There" allowed 
Lorber to solo 'on the piano, 
demonstrating hi ability as 
both a musician and 
prodigious performer. H is solo 
progressed from a rapid paced 
melody to a bebop number, a 
refreshing idea tht got a 
marvelous response. 

San Diego's own PURL 
opened for The Jeff Lorber 
Fusion. This fusion quintet 
played an unusual blend of 
funk and latin elements which 
incorporated with their own 
musical styles resulted in a 
very energetic set - in effect 
they were a great warm·up 
band. 

Caffeine effects 

Especially notable was the 
opening number "Emergency 
Exit." "Port Of Call" had a 
fantastic fretless bass solo and 
their last tune of the evening, 
"Coming Through ," was 
exhorbitantly tight, and 
s howed a band well on it's way 
to establishing itself in the 
forefront of the local jazz 
scene. 

continued from page 4 
between increased caffeine 
consumption and success in 
academic performance. The 
grade point average was found 
to be significantly higher in 
the abstainers as compared to 
the high consumer group (2.38, 
2.28, 2.14, 1.83 for abstainers, 
low, moderate and high 
consumers respectively) . 
Since grade point average is 
based on differences in 
cour ework, an analYSIS of a 
common academic measure 

(the introductory psychology 
grade) was also conducted. 
Similar findings were 
obtained here. Furthermore, 
out of the42 Incompletegrades 
assigned, the vast majority (71 
percent) was received by high 
and moderate consumers. 

With the increase in reports 
on the detrimental value of 
caffeine consumption, perhaps 
we should exercise more 
restraint in our daily caffeine 
intake.
