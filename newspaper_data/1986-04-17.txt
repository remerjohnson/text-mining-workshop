THE MEANING OF LIFE 

eI4Ut ~ t6J"~ 
J4~1f4, 

By KEN FURlE. Features Editor 

LAST NIGHT, I didn't get to sleep at all. I wasn't studying, watching TV or anything like that. I was up 
contemplating the meaning of life, and I have come 
to a conclusion. The true and ultimate meaning of 
life. above and beyond any other factor of human 
existence, is doubt. 

I began by trying to sleep, but I didn't feel tired. 
Graduation is a forbidding presence which is 
approaching rapidly, and I am beset by doubts of 
my own ability. as a writer, to succeed - to 
succeed as I visualize success. Thoughts about 
graduation and my own writing and skills came 
without invitation, and I set about to ponder my 
future . 

I look at my writing, and I say to myself, "Yes, it 
is good. Sometimes, when I try, it is good." But it is 
not good enough yet. I know that. My problem -
what keeps me up at night, comes from the doubts 
that pounce upon this admission. My writing is 
good, but it's not good enough, and perhaps it

Magnetic center 
attracts attention 

On Warren campus, a new 
national center devoted to 
Improving magnetic recording 
technology - the underpinnmgs 
of the computer and video 
recording industries - was 
dedicated March 27 . 

The Center for Magnetic 
Recording Research (CMRR) IS 

BLOOM COUNTY 

one of only two major academic 
centers for magnetic recording 
research and education outside 
Japan. 

CMRR is the reatlon of UCSD 
and 12 powerful industnal 
backers, responding (Q society's 
insatiable appetite for 
information. As the flow of 
information Increases, so does 
the need for dramatic advances 
in magneti recording and 
srorage equipment and materials. 

The little floppy disks that 
people pur in their computers 
now - their word processors -
hold abour one million bytes 
(units) of information. I expect 
that within another 10 years, 
they'll hold perhaps 50 million 
bytes of information," said 
Mallinson, CMRR director. 

"The belief IS that if this 
country doesn 't keep running as 
fast as it can in computers and 
video recorders, the industry will 
be overtaken by the Japanese," 
Mallinson concluded 

Festival boasts best

The nearly 20 events in 
UCSD's Paclnc Ring Festival , 
sponsored by the Department of 
MUSIC, represent some of the 
finest works of contemporary 
artists from the Pacinc Basin 
countries. 

The festival , which began with 
an Installation of Mexican artist 
Humbeno Spindola's paper 
archItecture at the MandeVIlle 
Gallery, will premiere works in 
an, music, dance, architecture, 
film , costume and drama, as it 
continues on through spring 
until June 4. 

UCSD composer Roger 
Reynolds said, "The art that we 
who live in the Pacific are 
making for the future will be far 
more dIverse than that which the 
Atlantic community has made .

A valuable 
reSOURCE 
By KRISTEN MCClEARY 

T HIS WEEKE lD UCSD students will be interacting with the San Diego community by volunteering their time and services to businesses and private households in response to 
a fundraising organization, tudems Organizing University 
Resources through Community Exchange (SOU RCE). 

Friday, Saturday and unday, students will do various work 
within the community such as filing and typing for law rirms or 
yardwork and errands at private residences in exchange for 
monetary donations to the univerSIty. 

This is SOURCE's second year in existence. The first year proved 
vety su cessful, as approximately 90 students helped earn almost 
$5,000. 

The proceeds from SOURCE are used to aid student 
organizations and to help expand student facilities. This year, 40 
percent of the money is aUocated for sorority, fraternity and dorm 
events while the remaining 60 percent will help finance the 
Associated Students cafe. . 

This cafe project was chosen due 'tO the overwhelming student 
response it gathered. The cafe - is somethingwhich is really needed 
on this campus," Maty Rose Alexander, AS president. said. "It'll bea . 
place to go to get a good cup of coffee from early in the morning to 
late in the evening," she added. 

"We are fOCUSing on a new aspect of the project this year by 
emphasizing donors' participation through working for their 
favorite charities," Catherine Chow, SOURCE's coordinator said . In 
March for example, students helped staff and organize the Buick 
10K run which benefited the YMCA Crime Victirns Fund, Chow is 
currently organizi ng projects with the La Jolla Cancer Research 
foundation and the San Diego Urban League. 

By working through charities, Chow said that more interest was 
generated by both students and donors , as donors could help out 
their own pet projects as well as the university; at the same time , 
students feel they're helping the community more effectively. 
Through charity groups, private donors sponsor the students in 
addition to the charities. 

"SOURCE is a way to show the community that UCSD students 
have a sense of civic responsibility," Chow said . She found that 
most local businesses were familiar with the San Diego State 
University internship programs, but thought of UCSD as "the 
school on the hill. The quality of our students is high , but we need 
more exposure withm the professional work force ." she said . 

Chow hopes that SOURCE will become a tradition at UCSD and 
foresees three weekends dedicated to community interaction 
throughout the sc hool year. 

"The students and the businesses will get the most out of it," 
Chow said. "I think it will be very successful." 0

This can all happen within a

One course of acnon is the 
Internal Revenue Service, Kamm 
said . When students file their 
federal income tax returns, the 
stale governments can get the 
addresses of defaulted debtOrs 
who have moved out of state. 
The IRS can also withhold refund 
payments from the students and 
apply this money to the

Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL). 

This action was implemented 
in October of 1985. The state

OPINIONS 

I ' THE REAL WORLD ... 

Uncovering the roots of wannaking 
Our president has now pathologically manifested the tenets of hb 

war-making administration . We have seen the signs and symptoms for 
(he past five years, but none of us really believed it would happen. We 
never thought that all of Reagan's condescending and judgmental talk 
would lead us to an offensive attack. Or did we? War does not come 
about overnight. 

Since 1956, when we induced the Shah's regime in Iran, the nationals 
and citizens of the Middle East have attempted co regain their 
sovereignty while fighting to overcome their own do~esti~ proble~s . Of 
late , the Libyans have forcefully assened the great ammosuty they reel 
toward the United States for intervening in that area. They have 
retaliated violently, and the administration claims that their attacks are 
unwarranted. We must question such a judgment from the Reagan 
Administration. 

Reagan's policy toward the Libyan government has consistently been 
_one of non-negotiation with terrorists. Really, this policy has afforded 
him the greatest opportunity co avoid intelligent political engagement 
with the international community. Instead of attempting co solve the 
tension that has arisen between the United States and Libya, Reagan has 
continued co aggravate the hostility. He has refused to negotiate for 
peace under the guise of providing a strong defense for the United 
States. Reagan's first priority is co parade our military "strength" in front 

of the nations. His policies have welled-up patriotism at the expense of 
peaceful negotiations. Such a destructive national pride must not 
continue. 

We must begin to allow peace. Throughout our involvement with the 
countries of the Middle East we have asserted our dominance. 
Consistently, we have coaxed them co relinquish their cultural integrity 
for the sake of our "rights." We have now dared the Libyans wilh our 
maneuvers into the Gulf of Sidra, and they have refused to bow. 
Violence is always reprehensible, but those who provoke attacks are as 
guilty as those who do attack. War, in all forms, bullying, on all levels, 
le?d to destruction. 

According to Reagan, we ' ~assened our freedom" in the Gulf of Sidra. 
Perhaps it is time to reevaluate the meaning and responsibilities of 
freedom. Does freedom still hold an adolescent meaning for us? Do we 
only do what we wannna do? Individually, everyone 9f us outgrew that 
when we learned about living in a community. We learned that we had 
to be social, communicative and cooperative in order co live happily. 
Administrative and congreSSional policies must reflect this same 
knowledge. The United States is undeniably a member of the 
international community. We must make peaceful living our priority, 
and we must manifest it throughout our political encounters.

A sour taste 

Editor: 
I am wnung to express an 

extreme dissatisfaction over the 
Guardian's handling of the 
election. 1 must write th is letter 
before the elections because of 
press deadli nes. So whether I 
have won or lost is nOt known 
and is not important to the topiC 
at hand. 

1 have, m my three years here 
at UCSD, always (at least until 
thiS qua rter) held the Guardian in 
high regard for their interesting 

articles and timely dissemination 
of infonnation. Now, after having 
fallen prey to the Guardian 's lack 
of objectiVity and journalistic 
integrity, I take a totally different 
view of this paper. 

1 don't mind the fact that you 
endorsed my opponent. It was 
your 'Opinions' page and you 
had every right to express your 
views. What 1 found most 
disconcerti ng was what appeared 
outSide of the editorial page . 
Your coverage of th e elections 
and the candidates was shabby 
and unprofessional. You 
succeeded in misqummg rwo 

presidential candidates, screwing 
up the facts about me and 
generally succeeded in slanting 
the anicles in favor of your allies 
wh o ran for office. 

Of concern , also, is the fact 
that cenain letters to the editor 
were printed while others were ' 
not, inch,trling a letter by Mary 
Rose Alex'ander, one by Chris 
Moore and an anicle by Ariel 
Anguiano. It seems evident that 
they were d ropped either 
because thei r content or their 
high quality of writing did not 
match those of your staff.

Atkinson's parade 
By PHIL WIllON 

It's just past noon at the 
Revelle Fountain. Two guys (Bob 
and Sam) dressed in shorts and 
sunglasses are drinking Dr. 
Pepper and scanning the plaza. 
Suddenly they spot a 
distinguished looking man in a 
navy blue suit walking towards 
them: 

Bob: (pointing) "Who's that?" 
Sam: "Where?" 
Bob: ~Over there - the guy 
with the hair." 
Sam: (quickly peels off his 
sunglasses) "My God! That's 
Phil Donahue! . . . No, waIT, it, 
can't be. Donahue only wears 
tweed" . It's ". It's ." It's 
ChanceDor Arkin!On!" 
Bob: "Atkinson? Here? Naa. It 
can't be." 
Sam: "I'm pretty sure it's him." 
Bob: "You've seen him 
before?" 
Sam: "Well, not live or 
nothing, but I saw his picture 
in a magazine once. I think 
he was wearing the same 
suit: 
Bob: (takes a sip of his Dr. 
Pepper) "Amazing, wait 'till 
ten evetyone. Who's that short 
person walking next to him?" 
Sam: "Can't tell - looks a bit 
like Marlo Thomas." 

• • • Tonight at 7 pm at Why Not 
Here?, Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson wiD grace the stUdents 
of this university with the 
second "Chatting with the 
Chancellor" forum of the Year. 
It's a rare opportunity to see him 
in living color and (gasp!) to ask 
him a question or two. The "I 
talked to Rich" T-shirts and 
buttons will go on sale foDowing 
the performance. 

Of cOUJSe, the chanceDor is a 
busy man - traveDing around 
the counrry, meeting with Big 
Dave Gardner and the Relents 
up north with faculty and 
staff at home, while juggling 
whatever else chancellors jugle 
(he never returns my phone caDs 
50 I 'M>uldn't know). But even 
with all mis, he manages to 
squeue an hour or two each 
quarter out of his packed 
schedule .just to chat with the 

rc;-\ (~C 

11,000 undergraduates on 
campus. What a guy. 

How can you blame him? His 
chats are a waste of time. The 
script is already written. One 
brave soul will stand up and 
demand more on-campus 
housing and parking; Atkinson 
will answer that both are "top 
priority" and are planned for the 
very near future . End of 
conversation. Another student, 
probably in the front row, wiU 
ask the chancellor about UC 
investments in South Africa; 
Atkinson wiD respond that, while 
he, personaDy, is against any 
support of the country's 
deplorable apartheid govemment, 
he must back the Regents' 
policies. End of ton."ersation. 
Next wiD come questiOns about 
the grading system C+' and '-'). 
the amletic program, UCSD's 
priority of research over teaching 
and the new University Center. 
Bing - Bang - Boom, it's over. 
The students will leave , gratified 
that they got their say, and the 
chancellor will leave, feeling that 
he's fulfilled his obligation to 
keep in touch. 

But hey, that's UCSD - the 
campus where undergrads take a 
backseat to research, graduate 
programs, Nobel laureate faculty 
and federal grants. AI. the last 
"Chatting with the Chancellor" 
held in November, Atkinson was 
asked if he thought these 
university policies were unfair to 
students. He countered that such 
a system ensures bener 
professors and a higher quality 
of education which, in the end, 
is beneficial to undergraduates. 
His "trlckle-down" theory has a 
familiar ring. 

Chancellor Atkinson enjoys 
braging about how the quality of 
student life has improved over 
the last couple of years and how 
UCSD has become one of the 
more popular UC's. Both are 
true, much to his credit, b\.l stiD 
don't hold much water. 

Ask him why his 
administration pur the concerns 
of neighboring La Jolians above 
those of its own students when it 
withdrew its suppon of the

construction of a smaU 
commercial center (stores, banks, 
restaurants and a ' pub) that was 
to be located across the street 
from Muir College , in the 
Blackhorse Farms lot; why UCSD 
sat idly by and aDowed La Jolla 
Village Square to be built , the 
mall that was rated by the LA 
Times as being one of the most 
expensive and useless in San 
Diego. when it was obvious that 
students couldn't afford to shop 
there . 

And now Atkinson is riding 
into town on the new University 
Center, preaching that it's going 
to save the day, create a college-
toWn atmosphere and galvanize 
the student body. If you've ever 
been to UCLA or Berkeley, you 
know those stUdent centers are 
jUst another place to eat lunch, 
see a movie, or buy an 
overpriced math book. 

Even the coDege system, once 
UCSD's pride and joy, is eroding 
to nothing. Third and ReveRe 
,students are spilt in [WO, living 
both on their own college as well 
as on Warren college. College 
provosts, who were once the 
ItliIste rs of our academic lives, 
are losing power and prestige 
with the advent of departmental 
deans (engineering and arts and 
sciences) that have crept in. It's 
no wonder so many students 
have abandoned their college 
loyalty for the rapidly growing 
Greek system. 

ChanceUor Atkinson must be 
proud - his university is 
rUnning like a weB-oiled 
machine, pumping out doctors, 
engineers and computer 
scientiSlS by the dozen into the 
thirsty job market. Srudent 
discontent, whether it be over 
parking, alcohol or Sowh Africa, 
is trealEd like a bad rash . Just 
soothe it with a few empty 
promises, maybe rub it in with 
some police enforcement and 
evenruaDy it wiD F away. 

No one wants to change the 
system anymore, they jUSl want 
to beat it. Undergraduates see 
rollege as a temporary weigh 
station. Why should they bother 
trying to improve their

Redefining journalism 
Edilor: 

I am disappointed with the 
methods that Niki Newlands and 
the Guardian editorial staff have 
chosen to pursue joumalism. I 
am referring to the April 7

endorse my opponent Mr.

only did you do a disservice to 
me, but also to the student body 
in general. 

In addition to my council 
duties, I am also a house adviser 
in the Muir donns. This has 
anowed me the chance to create 
prograrns that do not center 
around alcohol, given the 
recendy enacted campus alcohol 
policy. I have learned to adapt to 
the situation and plan successful 
non-alcoholic events. 

Ptrhaps in the future, the 
Guardian will aDow for space in 
its pages for the various 
candidates seeking political 
office to express their 
qualifications and expereinces in 
a clear and accurate manner. 
This may aleviate any possibility 
of misrepresentation of the 
candidates. Thank you for this 
opponunity to express myself.

Doubtful observations 
back to my mind that American 
bombs were faUing, falling on 
Libya, and that we were /rilling. 

What is wisdom, after al? 
When we disregard a "should": 

"country: or a "way of life ," 
when there is starvation and 
slaughter? They die , so that 
others may live, some might say. 
This I doubt tOO, when I see the 
gratuitous consumption in this 
country. Take a stroll down 
Prospect today, and then look at 
some pictures of Mexico City or 
Gua Ir mala , and see if you can 
find out what I'm talking about. 

Continued from c~r 
will be. This is a grave and 
terrifying concern to me. 

How does one gather the 
strength to continue with a plan, 
or even with life. when there is 
doubt gnawing your conviction? 
Strength is not needed, I say. 
Strength has nothing to do with 
it. There are no solid answers, 
and if there were, they too would 
be doubted. So we do as we 
think best. and sometimes what 
we think best is actually worst. 
This is something I must learn to 
live with. I must somehow come 
to accept doubt. 

Believe it or not, the story 
about Adam and Eve in the 
Garden of Eden is a true one; it 
happens every day. Every day, 
thousands of times, there are 
peoole in this world doing 

somedring they should not , 
because they doubt They doubt 
the wisdom of the "shoulds" in 
this world, and they doubt their 
own ability to observe and 
accept the "shoulds." Sometimes, 
most of the time , they disregard 
the "shoulds" completely. and 
create law themselves. Is this 
bad? I am beset by doubts. still. 

I have decided, while 
brooding over my own future , 
and the recent events in Libya 
and throughout the world , that 
neither I nor anyone else will 
ever be completely free of doubt. 
It shapes and bends us, 
diston ing and molding our lives 
with a power and finality that 
infl uences eve ry perspective and 
facet. Doubt, more than anything 
else, is the human condi tion. 

Not even the most fana tically 

religiOUS person, not even the 
Pope himself, could ever claim 
honestly that there was nevc:r a 
time in his life. or a Single 
moment, that he doubted the 
existence of God. God or no 
God , the Bible says, "T/tou shalt 
nOl kile This is a gUide to 
humans, wisdom of the ages. a 
"should." This statement is the 
most fundamental "should" I 
know. Yet through most of1)ur 
history, we have doubted the 
wisdom behind it. Killing is 
okay, it seems. if the reason is 
good enough. 

I was awake all last night, and 
the silence crept into my hean. I 
stared at my ceiling, and 
thoughts ran like a history 
through my mind, and when I 
concentrated , I could hear the 
cries of people. It kept coming 

"Thou shalt not lrill: we are 
creating a new "should." KiD 
when it is necessary. When is it 
necessary? Ask our government, 
and every other government and 
person that has killed. I doubt 
the wisdom of this. 

Fill my mind with rhetoric, 
and give me your reasons for 
killing. I will doubt you. TeU me 
there was no other way to deal 
with this situation, and I will 
doubt you again, and I will feel 
that all your reasons are 
insignificant, if you are using 
them as an excuse to kill. 
Sometimes I doubt that the 
human race can rise above its 
own shoncomings. 

I cannot hold human life in 
such disregard as to feel no 
pangs when humans are being 
kiUed in this world . EspeCially by 
other humans. What is a 

The worst ran of it aU, is that 
I am a pan 0 it. I am SUiky by 
association. and I am guilty for 
not living what I perceive as 
ukimalrly imponant. I vote, and 
in my colder motnents I 
defenSively say, ~I did my duty. I 
didn't vote for this, There's 
nothing more I can do." 

It is this which makes me lose 
sleep. Adam and Eve seem to be 
reaching for the apple today; we 
are doing something that we 
should know is wrong. "Thou 
shalt 'lot kill: And 1 .. . when it is 
so imponant to be sure, I doubt 
my own abiliry to make a 
difference. ~ 

MAZATLAN 
an adventurous trek 

By APRIL DURRETI 
AY BACK IN the 

W dreary month of December, twO friends and I 
decided that we would "do" 
Mazadan for Spring Break. 
Nothing sounded better to us as 
finals approached than lazing in 
the sun, talking to people and 
unnklng margaritas. 

After reading vanous 
brochures and talking to people , 
we decided that College Tours 
would provide the E-[Icket ride 
for our np-roaring adventure to 
MaZJdan. They seemed to offer a 
faIr price with lots of aC[lvities 
and va ri ery. 

My friend s and I agreed that 
being "a pan: of it all" wouldn 't 
be a half-bad idea. I! must have 
been the 1985 Quote of the Year 
that clinched it for us: "HaVI ng 
this much fun should he illegal." 

PaCKing IS alway a dimcult 
maltcr. EspeCIally when you 
know that the entIre contents of 
your closet were simply never 
intended to fit In your suitcase. 

Sigh. Okay. Maybe the 
fl uorescent orange terrycloth shin 
isn't quite the thing to wow them 
in the discos. Put it back. 

Choosing clothes proved to be 
absolutely simple when I found 
myself confronted with the 
suntan lotion rack in Sav-on. 
Would I need two, four , six, eight, 
10 or IS? Or would I need a 

I combination of all of the above? Finally, [ managed to fit 
clothes. a towel. suntan lotion .. 
reqUired 1.0.5, magazines to read 
and various other "can't leave at 
home" items into my luggage . 

We were set. We left Del Mar 
all excited to drive to the airport. 
Mazatlan loomed brightly in the 
distance when all of a sudden 
disaster struck. We were driving 
on the freeway and checking to 
make sure we hadn't forgotten 
anything, when sure enough we 
di LOvered we had. 

My friend had forgonen her 
proof of ci [lzenship. With ' it, she 
was a bona fide, grade "A" US 
ci ti zen. WIthout It , she would 
nm he able to gel home. 
Appealing as Mazatlan might 
seem , she decided for some 

~ reason [hat sprIng quaner was Ju~t lOO much of a temptation to ml s~ 0 we drow home [0 get her I D ~~ 6W' My hean wa ~ racIng [he entIre ~~, \~'\\ '.' ~ wa} to [he allvon Would we

make it on time? Would we get 
bumped from our seats? Would 
Mazatlan ever become a realiry 
instead of just an imagined 
fanta sy? 

For th ose of you on the edge 
of your seats, you can relax. OUT 
ti me in Mazatlan was fated to 
happen . From the beginning of 
our trip, the College Tours' 
students were made to feel 
specIal. The captain of the plane 
had a message just for us: "If the 
students on the College Tours 
trip do not be quiet and sit 
down in their scats, we are not 
leaving." I could tell then that our 
presence would not go unnoticed 
by lhe people in Mexico. During 
the night to Maza tlan I noticed 
[hat [he hotel my friends and I 
were Slaying a[ was called "Las 
Jacarandas " Oh God. What tlld I 
do to deserve thIS? Despite the 
seen-ling decades I have spent 

ma~tering (well . butchering) the

Continued from pap 6

say "Las Jacarandas." "We're 
at .. . you know .. . uh ... the hotel 
starting with J." A few days into 
our trip, however, and we had 
proudly conquered our former 
enemy "Las Jacarandas," 

Once we were safely deposilrd 
in our hotel (no thanks (0 the 
bus driver), the Magic of 
Mazadan began, 

The information that College 
Tours gave us contained twO 
veritable ~Is of wisdom for 
our Mazadan experience: 
Number One - DONT 
REMOVE YOUR WRIST BAND 
(This they highlighted in capital 
letters so it would not escape our 
attention). The unremovable 
wristband aUuded to was our 
proof that we Wl!re indeed 
members of College Tours. It 

gained us entrance into the 
infamous "aU you can drink" 
cocktail panics held nighdy for 
an hour. Without a wristband 
one was in danger of "not being 
a pan of it all" so we were 
careful to keep our wristbands 
firmly in place. 

My roommarr became so 
attached to her wristband that 
she still hasn't taken it off. I 
think she believes that as long as 
she wears it the magic of 
Mazadan wiU laSl forever. I don't 
want to be the one to delude 
her. 

To get to the locations to 
enjoy a good time, some Ilearty 
souls preferred walking, but most 
people took talds or pulmonias, 
small golf can type vehicles. We 
had our blue-c)'l!d blonde female 
friend attempt to lower the price 
as we figured that taxi drivers 
might be susceptible to her 
charms. Riding in the taxis was 
never a dull experience. Given 
that the main street in Mazadan 
has only one traffic signal, traffic

As. we !lad already hardened 

ourselves to the charms of the 
chiclets sellers at the Tijana 
airport, we were immune to 
them. However, we aJ50 had 10 
say "no" to the vendors that 
barraged the beach selling 
blankets. dresses, sombreros, 
silver jewelry and little toys. 

I was firm. I was not going to 
spend aU my money. Then on 
the fi fth day of our trip, I was 
suddenly overcome with an 
intense desi~ to possess silver 
blllcelet,s, and lots of them at 
that. I must have been sending 
out signals, because a vendor 
approached me. He walked away 
smiling after having sold me 
three bracelets and a pair of 
earrings. 

Late r in the day I was 
dismayed when another vendor 
asked me how much I had paid 
for each of my bracelets. "I'm not 
going to tell you ," I replied to 
him , not wanting to hear that I 
had been cheated earlier.

My friend qUickly thought of a

I had paid only 500 pesos each

1500 for each. 1500 pesos 
poorer, but three bracelets richer, 
I congratulated my friend on his

reluctant to leallC. UCSD seemed 
like a far off nightmare, with 
sunny Mazadan being the only 
reaUry we cared to know. We did 
not return to San Diego without 
memories and souvenirs 
however. Along with our tans, 
bracelets, and addresses of new 
friends, we brought back 
mosquito bites, rapidly 
diminishing voices, and empty 
waUets. As we were leaving, I 
suddenly realized that Mazadan 
was in the Mexican state of 
Sinaloa. Or as one would more 
often see it written: Mazadan, 
Sin. I smiled at this realization. 
The appropriateness of the name 
and the justice we had don~ to 
the Mazadan experience made 
me content to be in San DielJ>. 

Until next year's Spring Break, 
that is. ~

SDSU softball downs Tritons; 
Aztecs take two, 10-0, 4-3 
By ROBERT WHITE 

THE SAN DIEGO STATE softball team suffered through a rough road trip 
last week. After tough games up 
north , their problems were 
compounded when Iheir team 
bus broke down in Dominguez 
Hills. The lady Azrecs took some 
of their frustrations out on the 
Tritons who probably wish that 
those mechanics had ne~r 
found their way to the Azrec bus. 

In game one, the Tritons were 
thoroughly shut down by Stare 
ace Lisa Michie. The tough right-
hander surrendered only three 

- hits while handcuffing the 
Tritons at the p1are. Meanwhile, 
Michie received plenty of 
offensi~ support from her 
teammates who scored six times 
in the second inning. Stare 
tacked on four more runs in the 
subsequent innings to make the 
~ final 10-0 and complere the 

impressive victory. 
In game two, the Tritons 

turned things around and came 
within one pitch of a big upset. 
Triton pitcher Choon Drew shut 
the Aztecs down cold for the first 
five innings, not aUowing any 
runs. The freshman righty kept 
the opponents off balance, 
making quick work of the potent 
SDSU hitters. 

However, trouble arose in the 
sixth with a leadoff walk and a 
couple of infield Singles. Then 
came the pivotal pitch, Next 
Azrec batter Christine Maceranke 
stroked a liner to center which 
cleared the bases for a grand 
slam to make the score 4-0. 

When the Tritons came up for 
their last shot in the seventh 
they nearly caught up, but fell 
one run shon. 

The Tritons scored three times 
in the inning when Julie Steiman 

co nnected for a home run aftcr 
consecutive singles by Pam 
Hardaway and Patty Campbell. 
However, the suspense ended 
quickly as the side was returned. 
The Tritons came within a few 
breaks of puDing the upset as the 
final score ended 4-3. 

Triton coach Colleen WiJtht 
was pleased with the team's 
comeback in the second game. 
"Since State comperes in Division 
1 and can give away 
scholarships, any victory would 

ha~ been just a bonus. I'm 
happy the way we fought back, 
though 1 wish we had split: 

The Tritons are now 16-12 
o~ran and 6-0 in conference 
playas they prepare for a big 
doubleheader against La Verne 
on Friday. San Die~ State is 
now at 16-25 overall, while their 
record in the PCM is 3·9. ~

12 Thursila\<, ApnI1 7. 1Q86 

Budman's Softball Preason Picks 
I bet you are muttering abom my pre-

season picks coming out two weeks into 
the season. Hey dude, back off! It's cool, 
I've been on a rad scouting assignment for 
Augie down in the citrus league in Florida. 
The dude's signing my checks, so it's 
totany cool. Now on to the business I enjoy, 
picking the winners and the losers. 

Men's AM 
The dudes from the TKE frat are totally 

awesome. Their name is the Rectamatics 
and they are hot when it comes to softball. 
Last year they pulled a big upset by beating 
some old fans called the Profoathletics. 
This year all the dudes in AAA will be 
looking to shred these frat boys. The loss of 
some awesome talent and no real 
replacements in the new recruiting class 
could make them vulnerable . But with Man 
Lumsden's hot pitching and Bob Armell's 
gnarly outfield look for everyone else to be 
bummed. 

Teams to watch out Jor: 
Take No Prisoners - Last year's AA 
champs are way cool. The doc's can play 
this game. 
Boffos - Too old to know they're [00 old . 
Slider Insider - If cheap talk and big 
heads mean anything they will beat the 
New York Mets in the World Series. 
Juan Harry 800sh - Baseball players can't 
play softball, can they? 

Men's AA 
Why we always rate BOHlCA No. I is 

beyond me. These guys are weak dudes. 
They always gag on the big one in the final. 
So forget these guys. There 's no way they, 
will win it aU. I look for Wee Suk to keep 
shredding teams all the way to the AA 
championship. With Old Man Keeler and 
Fireball Carl they have all the cunnmg and 
expenence necessary to win it all. The only 
thing that can StOP them is the hatchet 
from the 1M Czars office. They have been 
kicked out of more 1M SPOrtS than any 
team in 1M history. These dudes are no 
dean jeans. 

Teams to watch out Jor: 
Token White Boys - No color here . 
Peabody's Pinky - Have some weak 
dudes from Out of state, but the other 
dudes are way hol. 
'Bags - Name is not rad, but the team is. 

Men 's A 
La Machine is totally awesome. In fact 

they're so rad they have a good chance of 
winning the AAA championship, which is 
where they probably will be playing in the 
playoffs. Now to the real 'A' teams. 

The talent is always a mystery in this 
division . Bm the team names are always 
way gnarly. 

·Fifth Annual 
California 

Floor Hockey 
Invitational 

Top names to watch Jor: 
Khadify Hit Squad - Are 2-0 this spring. 
Drunks Against Madd Mothers - I'll 
drink to that. 
Errattic DischaJge - Should clean up. 
Pop Thai Zit - Rad name. 
Nocturnal Emissions - Play best at night. 
Fubars - Screwed up beyond any 
reasonable sense. 

Coed AA 
This could be our toughest division. 

There are a huge bunch of hOt chicks and 
dudes in this division . Combat,last year's 
defending champs are way hot, but they 
aren't totally rad enough to think they can 
shred aU the competition. Team Bozo has 
the most far out ladies. Mary Beth Murray 
tried out for the Padres this year and was 
one of the last cuts. The guys on Team 
Bozo are semi·weak but the girls should 
carry them to the title . 

Teams to watch: 
Ferragut Boat Club - Mahvelous talent. 
Lillies of the Field - BeSt barbecuers on 
campus. 

Coed A 
Are you kidding? This division has over 

100 teams alone in it. Even lean'tputa line 
on this division . But I can give you an idea 
of who the most clever are . 

Team names to watch: 
Hicks, Pricks &: Teases - You said it. 
Bad News Boobs - Tatum and John's 
favorite team . 
Thimbleheaded Ghurkins - What? 
Dude We're In There - GOt to be cool. 
Sc.arf and Barf - Hungry for a win. 
Flat as a Tack - Not my problem. 
Guardian Thugs - First team ever to use 
our prestigious paper as a team name. 
What kind of chance do you think they 
have? 
Lock on the Cellar - SPCA \V3nlS your 
address. How can you beat a team 33-0? 
That was totally un-cool. 

Women 's 
More Bozos are no bozos. These gals are 

way awesome. No one will touch them . No 
Balls Here has, excuse the expreSSion, the 
balls [Q win It all . They can shred with any 
ladies on campus. 

Teams to watch: 
Feline Drive - Have awesome talent to 
bone the top teams. 
Flying Fangs - Like fine wine, these 
ladies get better with age . 
Second Wind - Rita'S got tota lly way Out 
talent. 
Just Here for the Beer - Budweiser, I 
hope . 

'. 
Don't forget the big event this Friday and Saturday in UCSD's Reckerdome. It's 

the Fifth Annual California Roor Hockey Invitational featuring teams from 
UnIversities all over the west coast. From Anzona State University to the eaS!., to UC 
Davis to the north . Eleven teams in aU make up thiS prestigious tournament. 

The defending champIOns are from nght here at UCSD. laS!. year LJCSD won the 
tournament for the first lime defeating UC anta Barbara 6· 1 m the final We are 
looking to repeat this year but we need your upport So come on out and w,nch 
some fantastic hockey at the Re{.kerdome.

Budman's Intramural 
So/tbaH Ratings 

as of 4/ 14 

, 

Innertube Waterpolo 

it is time to Look in on the old swimming 
hole. I heard that once again Innenube 
waterpolo was in full swing. Sure enough, 
the action is fast and furious , and carrying 
on into the wee hours of the night. This 
popular coed spon features more than 50 
teams vying for championships in three 
levels of play. 

Our AM level highli~hts our most 
talented tearns. Many poolside observers 
think that once again there is one learn 
that will run away with the title. Revenge of 
the A.B.I.D.s is playing with a renewed 
intensity after fall quarter 's 
disqualification. On the street, you 
wouldn't give the time of day to these 
misfits - O.K, the gals really don't fit in 
with the guys (so why do you keep playing 
with them?). In the pool, it's all business. 
Captain Wiggins has assembled seven of 
the finest players in recent history. They 
play together like the Chicago Bears, and 
should roll to the title like the Bears. 
Fighting for second will be the Rubber 
Bagels , Team Divothead, lSI Lihaide Ren. 

The AA competition should be very 
competitive . The McAuliffe league features 
twO teams that should comend for the title. 
Chris Wood's Aqualung crew features a 
group of cagy veterans, but Captain Wood 
may need to get a hold of his temper if they 
are to go all the way. Perennial AA 
powerhouse Dick's Shooters has their 
Sights on the title that has eluded them in 
the past. Playing on Thursday night, Fred's 
Love Machine feels it may light the victory 
cigar in June. This should be the last shOt 
for this squad of greybeards. 1 he Wet 
Dreamers have gone through some 
personnel changes, but always seem to 
find a way to win. 

In the Single A level, also known as the 
sandbag division , we have the usual 
contingent of teams playing below their 
level. So often, though , it is a surprise 
darkhorse team thai captures the title and 
sends the sandbaggers packing. This 
should be a wide·open division and be the 
site of some of the biggest laughs in IMs 
this quaner as first timers struggle to stay 
afloat.

Beach Volleyball 
Crown 

It was a misnomer of the worst SOrt, but 
when the last spike was buried in the sand 
Saturday afternoon, everyone agreed that 
the Third Annual Sunlite Volleyball Classic 
was a tremendous success. 

Jeff Babcock and Lisa Hudson, a pair of 
beach-sman volleyball veterans took the 
tournament title with a hard-fought 15-11 
victory over Scott Criswell and Carol 
Lipson in a match marred by blustery, 
windy conditions at La Jolla Shores. 

Even though the weather refused to 
cooperate (most partiCipants wanted to 
rename it the Fog Bank Classic), 40 some 
odd players got their fill of sand volleyball 
and then some. In a marathon preliminary 
bracket that saw each panicipant play six 
different matches with six different 
partners, Upson, Howard Bishop and 
Christy Wada came Out on top with 
perfect marks (6-0, 66 points). 

This didn't seem to deter Babcock and 
Hudson who paired off in the single ·dim 
championship round as the 7th· eeded 
learn . The talented hitter·bu.mp se tter 
combi nation won an ex iting 13-11 
overtime match over the 0 , 1- eeded 
Bishop and hiS partner VIckie Haire In the 
first round, and then defeated Gil Gencl 
and Ilene Zarour 11·8 In the c;cmls 

In the champIOnship match , I3.Ibcock 
and Hudson g0t out of the g.lIe e.\rly .md 
cruised in , never relinquishmg their lead

Jazz, as a musical genre, has 
been around lo nger than any

popular music and indeed is 
the root of many styles toJay. 
Strangely, tho ugh, it has nevt:r 

achieved the level of success 
that rock has. It seems 
unlikely that there wo uld be a

sports arenas. It seem!! equally 
unlikely that the strongest 
part o f the music scene in San 
Diego right now, is jazz. KI-
FM's Lites Out Jazz program, 
City College's Jazz 88 radio 
and Humphrey's Concerts by 
the Bay jazz series have not 
only created an awareness but 
an enthusiasm for jazz in San 
Diego. 

The All-Campus Jazz 
Festival happened last unday 
on the lawn south of UCSD's 
Humanities Library . The 
concert, which lasted eight 
hours, featured some of an 
Diego's finest jazz artists as 
well as a few surprises from 
Los Angeles. UCSD's own 
Jazz Ensemble opened the 
show, followed by New 
Shooze, Fattburger. Sprague-
man and the LA Connection. 

. The latter group was th rown 
together specifically for this 
show. The band is comprised 
of Ricky. Lawso n, drummer 
for the Yellowjackets, bassist 
Nathan East and keyboardist 
Bobby Lyle - both studio 
musicians and members of Al 
j arreau's touring band. The 
1500-2000 person turnout 
for the a ft e rno on was 
impressive. 

The festival was conceived 
as an alternative to other 
ca mpu s programming 
according to Tom Vinolus. 
organizer for the event. "We 
wanted higher quality 
programming that would 
foster more campus unity and 
wouldn't stress alcohol the 
way a TO would." 

The idea seemed to work 
quite well though the crowd 
was never the size of a beer-
baiting TO. Also, the concert 
seemed to cater to an older 
crowd of students who might 
not normally attend TGs; so,

Humph. • • 

There were over 60,000 tickets sold for jazz concerts at 
Humphrey's last year. The small concert series produced 
by Southland Concerts has been the best and most 
successful of its kind in the area. While the concert facility 
seats nearly 1000, it is still intimate and there is not a 
single bad seat in the house. For this reason, many acts 
that could go to larger facilities (like the San Diego State 
Open Air Theater) and make more money, opt to play at 
Humphrey's. 

There have been over 20 acts confirmed for the 1986 
. season at Humphrey's including (but not restricted to) 

Hiroshima, Miles Davis, B.B. King, Azymuth, Ray 
Charles, Ramsey Lewis and many, many more. Tickets are 
on sale now for all scheduled shows, the first of which is 
Hiroshima on May 15.

Teens are hUlllan, too 
by john singh 

Right from the opening 
moments of the new film 
Lucas we know we are in for 
something special. It begins 
with " !xust on a flower; not 
an ordinary beginning for a 
" teen" film (a term I use very 
begrudgingly); but then again, 
this is no ordinary film, 
" teen" or otherewise. Lucas is 
special , and anyone who 
claims to even like the movies, 
much less lo ve them, should 
be required to see it at least 
once. 

Lucas is a " teen" film at 
least inasmuch as its main 
characters are all between 13 
and 20. But beyond that, the 
label would have to be 
removed because somethin~ 
happens about m idwa y 
through the film that never 

happens 10 movies like Porky's 
or The Breakfast Club: Lucas 
and the rest of his friends 
become human - not just 
gr oss ly ove r exagger ated 
charicarures. What happens 
to Lucas happens to everyone 
sometime in his life, and the 
gende lesson Lucas teaches is 
as applicable to a 41-year-old 
from Peoria as it is to a 17-
year-old from Malibu. 

First-time director David 
Sel tze r ( who pre v io usl y 
scripted The Omen) has 
infused much love into Lucas, 
and it shows. It is hard to 
imagine this movie being any 
better than it already is. 

It is also difficult to 
synopsize the film without 
making it sound trite. ana

loo k at this film . 

These are not "brat pack" 
teenagers, but rather actors 
who are good at their craft. As 
Lucas, Corey Haim gains our 
sympath ies from the moment 
he appears o n screen. His is an 
ingratiating, almost perfect 
performance. As Maggie, his 
wo uld·be girl friend , Kerri 
Green (of The Goonies) is 
more than adequate; in fact, at 
times she seems so grown-up 
and sensible we feel we know 
her well. 

But it is Charlie Sheen as 
football-jock Cappie Roew. 

who almost walks away with 
the film. He has inherited his 
father's ( Marti n Sheen) 
passion and intensity and 
none of his brother's (Emilio 
Es tevez) te nd e n cies to 
a vera t. Perhaps Cappie isn't 
the most complex of the film's 
trio of main characters, but 
Sheen gives us a feeling that 
there are sides to Cappie that 
·few are privileged to see, and 
we are some of thQse few. 

In fact, it is amazing just 
h ow co mple x all th ese 
characters are. What The 
Breakfas t Club stars took a 
whole film to do (none too 
well either) , these three 

. manage to do in just a few 
scenes. They open themselves 
up to us and none of their 
moves or actions seem false .

That, I think , is why Lucas 
succeeds so completely. There 
are moments in the film when 
we prepare ourselves to feel 
chea ted; we know we have 
seen this all before and th is 
isn' t going to be anything new. 
But then Seltzer and his cast 
do a wonderful and unique 
thing: they let the characters 
take over, and the unexpected 
happens. There are moments 
in Lucas we forget we are 
watching a movie. The fights, 
the loves - all the events 
seem to be unfolding right 
before our eyes, not written 
down on paper for actors to -
perform. 
When this happens we begin 
to understand the reason 
people make and go to

whether there Will be anyone 
to carry '.' rt '/ ith the festival. 
He wouW like to see it taken 
over by another programming 
entity on campus. 

As for the bands that 
performed: 

The UCSD Jazz Ensemble 
was, and, as long a Jimmy 
Cheatom still directs, will 
always be a wonderful 
addition to any jazz :.now. 

New Shooze is d competent 
act, but would be better if they 
got rid of their vocalist or at 
least the songs he sings. 

It was strange to see people 
dancing to Fattburger. This is 
not to say that jazz is typically 
not a danceable medium, 
simply that Fattburger is not a 
typical jazz band . They 've 
finished their first record 
which will be out in about 
three weeks on Goldenboy 
Records in Los Angeles with 
national distribution from 
Atlantic Records. Hollis 
Gentry, the group 's saxo-
phonst and long-time 
cornerstone to the San Diego 
jazz scene, will be leaving 
Fattburger inJune to form his 
own band. Spragueman, 
d scribed by Fattburger's 
keyboardist, Carl Evans, as 
"genetically perfect," fit the 
description through a 
flawless, though perhaps a 
little too clinically executed 
set. 

The LA Connection was 
the evening's big surprise. 
Hopefully the ad hoc band 
will stay together and do some 
recording.

ith special guest ••• 
by sue peters 

The Chur h - another one 
of those vaguely familiar 
name listed as a "special 
guest" of a more well,known 
band. And at the moment, 
there are quite a few of these 
'guests' who happen to be 
good bands in their own right. 
Coincidentally , many are 
from Australia. 

Coming up are some good 
concerts with very promising 
support group/ main attrac, 
tion combinations: elegant 
Ms. Aphlett of the Divinyls 
warming up for the equally 
charming Ian Astbury of The 
Cult April 25 at SDSU; later 
this year, Jimmy Barnes, (ex, 
lead singer from the popular 
Australian rock group, Cold 
Chisel) with his vodka,shot 
eyes, high~nergy vocals and 
current single "Working 
Class Man," (which is geting 
airplay from 91X & KGB 
FM) will support ZZ Top in a 
national tour of the United 

tates; and tomorr w night, 
also at SD U' Open Alr 
Theatre, guitar,oriented The 
Church will be opening for 
Echo and the Bunnymen. 

Some people might 
remember last year ' s 
performance of The Church 
at SDSU's Backdoor; a good 
show with excellent guitar and 
vocals. This year, they're 
promoting their la test album 
Heydey which has a spiffy 
picture on the cover of the 
four members in oriental 
carpet backeround. But don't 
let that put off. The Sydney 
group's psychedelic overtones 
date back to the early days ot 
their fi rst self,titled album 
whose singles "The U nguard, 
ed Moment," "Too Fast for 
You," and "Is this Where You 
Live' made it into the 
Australian charts and 
prompted the band's first 
appearance on the weekly 
national music show, 

Councdoum. 
Now, five years later, the 

band has followed through 
with a string of albums, the 
latest of which Heyday shows 
the most commercial promise 
and maybe the m ost 
elaborately produced album 
to date. 

The four members, lead 
vocalist Steve Kilbey, Marty 
Wilson Piper and Pete r 
Koppes on gu itars and 
backing vocals, and Richard 
Ploog on drums, have now 
enlisted the support of a 

. backing vocal chorus, and 
have added more synthesizer. 
The result: an album with a 
much fuller sound that in the 
early days. Only songs like 
"Disenchanted," "Already 
Yesterday," and "Youth 
Worshipper" closely 
resemble old Church, while 
lively, danceable numbers like 
"Tantalized," "The View" 
and "Columbus" ( which has

pro pe 'tive uc e sful ingle 
material. 

The album can al 0 boa t a 
certain degree of diver ity. At 
one end of the pe trum i 
"Tri te e," whi h is heavily 
la ed with a '60s zitar sound. 
Then there is "Happy 
Hunting Gro u nd," an 
instrumental which starts off 
with an Echo,ish gu itar 
sound, followed by a heavy 
Cure,ish ("Pornography") 
drum transistion. But with the 
introduction of heavy str ings, 
the song begins to sound 
frighteningly similar to the 
Little House on the Prairie 
theme song ... Fortunately, 
tha t 's th e o n ly r e al 
disappoi ntm e nt on an 
otherwise skillful and lively 
bit of vinyl. 

So when you go to the 
Open Air Theatre tomorrow 
night to see the Bunnymen, 
think about getting there in 
time for the support band as 
well - in their homeland, 
they would be the main 
attraction.
