Seduction of the innocents? 
Su bl i m inal 'science sells ads 

by Laura A. Richter 
NPws Editor 

An ice cube can be a dangerous weapon. 
According to Dr. Wilson Bryan Key, who 

spoke at UCSD Wednesday evening, the 
subliminal induction of images through 
advertisements is commonly and successfully 
employed by corporations who seek large 
returns on their investments in advertising. 

Key, author of Subliminal Seducation and 
Media Sexploitation and holder of a PhD in 
Communications from the University of 
Colorado, demonstrated through slide 
enlargements of ads that distorted human and 
animal figures , who frequently appeared to be 
engaged in sexual activities, are often 
integrated into the scenes, such as glasses filled 
with ice cubes in liquor ads. He explained that 
the pictures are often not photographs, as they 
may appear, but are an artist's reconstruction 
with composite photos or airbrush . 

Scientific experiments have concluded that 
only four milliseconds are required time to 
convey material to most people, said Key, who 
called the one to two seco ds average viewing 
time for an ad •• abundant." Key did not offer an 
explanation of why this type of induction is 
effective, but he noted that the implanting of 
sexual and violent images into a picture is based 
on the Freudian assertion that man is 
preoccupied with the origin and end of life. 

"For years we thought that our values would 
propagate democratic idealism," said Key, 
continuing that media studies reveal that 
probably the opposite is happening. "We've lost 
our ability to distinguish between reality and 
fantasy, and we've been educated that way on 
purpose." He asserted that the fantasy world 
has become more desirable, alluding to the 
app.arent " perfection" of Playboy centerfolds. 
Key remarked that "You just can't get women

AS constitution 

Friday, JMuery 17, 1978 

by Mark Stadler 
Senior Editor 

An AS-appointed task force now reviewing the government's 
constitution is considering options ranging from removal of the 
commissioners from the AS Council to increasing the number of 
college representatives. 

Pre-med prep may .be .axed 
The 10-member task force was formed to look into "the obvious 

little things in the constitution that need clarification," according 
to chairman Eric Rodli , the AS public relations director. 

Rodli said the two major areas of concern for the task force are 
drawing up job descriptions for the 11 AS commissioners and 
determing the makeup of the council. 

Budget -request to continue program unsuccessful 
UCSD, which prides itself on 

a high medical school accep-
tance rate, is in danger of losing 
a significant portion of its pre-
med advising program. 

the emphasis in her office will 
be shifted to include at least 
minimal coverage for all 
students who need counseling 
in the allied health fields . This, 
said McCarthy, could conceiv-
ably result in a lower medical 
school acceptance rate for 
UCSD. 

A budget request to Student 
Affairs for more funding has 
not been successful. 

The possibility of the natural 

sciences departments sharing 
the burden of pre-med, pre-dent 
advising is currently being 
explored, said McCarthy. 

Pre-med student David 
Kerns, who has worked with 
McCarthy to secure more 
funding for the health care 
adVising program said, "We 
students have enough to worry 
about with grades and getting 
into med school. It would be a 
shame if we lost these services. 
They have been a great help. " 

According to Peggy Mc-
Carthy of the Career Planning 
and Placem'ent OHice , the 
Medical College Admissions 
Test prepatory course and the 
time consuming but increasing-
ly essential interview process, 
which have been instrumental 
in securing for UCSD a 60 
percent medical school accep-
tance rate, will be cut or 
drastically curtailed next year 
without further funding and

Montana may strike down 
laws on home-grown pot 

(CPS) - Home pot growers, at least those in Montana, may 
have reason to take heart if the case of a Missoula man charged 
with growing 15 marijuana plants is successful in court. 

58-year-old James Zander, with the help of the Montana chapter 
of NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana 
Laws), will ask for dismissal of his charges on ground that the 
privacy act of the state's constitution was violated. 

The case unfolded like this. According to a report in the Montana 
Kaimin, Missoula County sheriff deputies entered Zander's house 
on Nov. 4 ~hile responding to a call by one of Zander's neighbors 
who reported a man breaking into Zander's house while he was 
away. 

While inside, deputies noticed a light on in a closet. Thinking the 
burglar could be inside, they searched the closet, instead finding 
15 marijuana plants which one Region One Anti-Drug team 
member called "the most beautiful marijuana plants I've seen in a 
long time. " 

A search warrant was obtained and the plants were confiscated. 
A copy of the warrant was left behind. Members of the drug team 
visited the home several times, but no one was there. On Nov. 29 
Zander was finally arrested at his home. He posted a $1,000 bond 
and was released from Missoula County jail the same night. 

Robert Campbell, who will represent Zander and the Montana 
NORML, said he doesn't believe the state could prove that a small 
amount of pot is so dangerous that the state has a compelling 
interest in entering a private home to make an arrest. 

Campbell appears hopeful, saying that "the atmOlphere of the 
supreme court is generally favorable" for a privacy act challenge

run accidents are a frequent 
occurance at UCSD. 

Conviction in a hit and run 
incident could lead to six 
months in prison, a $500 fine, or 
both . 

Two subcommittees 
The task force, which has met for the past three weeks, has 

divided into two subcommittees. One panel will investigate the 
executive portion of the AS , including the president, vice-
president and commissioners. The other panel will concentrate on 
the 12 college representatives and the AS Council, which is 
currently comprised of the representatives and commissioners 
and is chaired by the vice-president. 

The task force will hold open hearings to allow student input, 
probably beginning early next month, Rodli said. 

Task force member Gary Moser, who is an AS representative 
from Muir College, said there are everal problems with the 
constitution as it currently stands, which stem mainly from its 
origin as a document designed for consideration in last year's 
govenrmental referendum. At that time, the constitution was 
designed to be simple and easy to read, so students would be able to 
readily understand it, Moser said . .. 

During the first quarter and a half of its actual operation, some 
ambiguities and structural problems have cropped up, Moser 
said. 

Another task force member, AS appointments and evaluations 
commissioner Jim Lofgren, said the task force has no set deadline 
for completing its review. 

" Originally we had a firm timeline, to have it all wrapped up by 
the end of the quarter," Lofgren said. "But we found that was 
impossible, if we want to do a thorough job. After all, it took UCLA 
a year and a half to do a complete constitutional review ." 

By next fall 
The task force, which is now meeting about once a week, hopes to 

have job descriptions for commissioners drawn up before the 
spring AS elections and to have its complete review finished for 
student body consideration in a referendum by fall quarter 1978, 
Lofgren said. 

While the job descriptions can be approved by the AS Council as 
bylaw changes, any constitutional review must be approved by the 
students, Lofgren said. 

According to Rodli , the executive subcommittee is now 
interviewing commissioners, prior to considering questions of (Please tum to paJ{e 8)

'Progressives gimp to old drummer' 
Editor: 

Here we go again, The recent CIA 
ad in the Triton Times has raised a 
furor among the so-called progres.' 
sives on campus. And they are 
gimping along to the same old 
drummer that roused them a scant 
two years ago. 

You might remember UC 
President David Saxon's ill-starred 
visit to UCSD in fall of '75 when he 
was accosted by a delegation of 
" progressives " in a not· so-nice 
manner . You may recall the 
charges subsequently leveled 
against the infamous CIA 10, the 
tortured reasoning behind their 
defense, and the ductile admini~­
trators who courageously imposed 
on the accused nothing less than 
academic probation . You wit-
nessed the rise of the Anti-CIA 
Coalition, a group of enterprising 
young people who handled the PR 

for the CIA 10. 
It is now 1978 , The pseudo-

martyrs of the CIA 10 have, by and 
large, intruded into other areas 
with the ban k ru pt Ma rx i st, 
doclrines. The Anti-CIA Coalition, 
demoralized over their inability to 
wipe the CIA of( the face of the 
earth, have long since faded into 
oblivion. In fact, the entire CIA 
fiasco was the final gasp of the 
radicalism spawned a decade ago. 

But despair not ! The same 
twisted impulses tug at the hearts 
of today's progressives who are 
resurrecting the innocuous themes 
of the sIXties. They spend nearly as 
much time enumerating the 
benefits of statism as they do 
wallowing in seU-adulation. Their 
reasoning escapes logic . The 
progressive buzz words - libera· 

Evangelist's actions

. Edito/': I 
I aIel aware of students' opinions oftheevangelistJed Smock who was on 

Reve Ie Plaza February 13, Some people feel that he was speakinll the 
truth but in his approach he was not accurately portraying the loving 
Christ; others feel that he is simply a religious fanatic; still others write 
him t4f as beIng M'MY. 

1'd Jke to respond to these attitudellloy pointtng out one thing: Mr, Smock 
blrnsel~ is not the issue; God is. 

Ttwulh I personally don't agree with Mr. Smock's methods, I'm glad he 
was tete. We at UCSD need to be challenged to consider Jesus , Mr. Smock 
c1aiJr.ea that God loves us and doesn't want us to live in hatred and fear so 
He too~ the form of a man, sbowed us how to live, and made it possible for 
us to live that way (by dyinll for us and rising a,ain) . He claimed that 
tbrot;gb God's own actions we humans can have a dynamic and very real 
personal relationship with God Almighty! Is this true or not? Tbis is the 
iuue. If these thin,s are false , then no harm Is done. If we really can know 
God personally then It is worth time and effort to find out. 

I say this because I do have an intimate relationship with Jesus. But 
don't take my word for It. Read the New Testament, weigh the facts, and 
decide for yourself whether or not this deserves pursuing.

tion, human rights , democracy -
are wholly contradictory to their 
oft-stated goals of curtailing free 
enterprise, expandi.ng governmen-
tal authority , and of course 
abolishing the Intelligence 
eata blishment. 

Oddly, the progressives ' propa· 
ganda falls short of imputing the 
Soviet Union, by far the most 
imperialist regime today , with 
extending the tentacles pf neo-
colonialism into every corner of the 

world. One wonders why the 
progressives, who claim to be 
defenders of freedom, remain 
unmoved by totalitarianism as 
practiced by the rulers of Red 
China , Cambodia, Vietnam, Cuba 

and Eastern Europe. What of the 
Russian dissidents Shcharanaky, 
Bukovsky, Sakharov, Ginzbur" the 
signers of Charter 7 and all tbo8e 
under Soviet domination who have 
courageollsly called for basic 
human rights, due process of law, 
individual social and economic 
liberties and the right to freely 
worship God? 

On the thin IS that really maUer, 
the pro,ressives remain silent.

Letters to the editor 
More on CIA ad 

Editor: 
In response to an editorial by the. 

Prolfessive Coalition, printed in 
the Feb. 13, 1971 issue of the Triton 
Times, concemiDl the printing of 
an ad for employment with the CIA, 
I must say that you (the Triton 
Times) have only changed your 
advertising policy for the better. 
Althou,h myself, and probably 
most or all of the staff of the Triton 
Times do not approve of some of the 
questionable acts performed by the 
CIA in the past, this is not the point 
at issue. 

The real question put forth here is 
that of censorship. It is not the 
responsibility of the Triton Times to 
morally judge its advertisors ' 
actions or the social implications of 
their ads (i.e. the Akai ad in the Oct. 
21, 1977 issue of the Triton Times) . 
If a paper partakes in this practice, 
then it is denying fundamental 
rights guaranteed in tbe First 
Amendment of the Constitution of 
the United States of America. 

To censor an ad or story is to 
bring a paper down to being the 
same "dirty beast" that the CIA is 
accused of being. It will be a ,reat 
day in the po Ii tical workin,s of our 
country when the so-call~ "free 
press" abandons a warped policy 
sucb as censorship in favor of equal 
representation of the facts . When 
this event occurs, the press will be 
fulfilling its real responsibilities to 
its reader, to bring an undistorted 
view of events, and thus, the public 
will be able to make its own 
decisions about issues with all the 
available information at hand. By 
abolishing censorship of its 
advertisors the Triton Times has 
brought us one step closer to this 
goal. 

In requesting that tbe CIA be 
excluded from campus publica· 
tions the Progressive Coalition is requ~sting the censorship of a 
recognized organization in this 
country . Thus, the Progressive 
Coalition is asking for the denial of 
the rights granted in the First 
Amendment. This ri,ht to " free-
dom of expression" and "freedom 
of the press" cannot and should not 
be denied. The CIA should have the 
same right to advertise in the 

Triton Times, in the same way ~at 
any other organization has the n,bt 
to. 

MARTIN BRENNER 

Ad furor due 
to naivete 
Editor: 

The furor over the CIA advertise-
ment stems, stran,ely enough , 
from naivete and romanticism on 
the part of those outra,ed by the 
ads. The CIA's "activities" are not 
monolithically evil. A massive 
proportion of their work consists of 
analyzing information necessary 
for our country's survival in the 
modern world . It is naive to think 
that we can survive peacefully 
without such intelligence informa· 
tion. 

A minute percentage of the CIA's 
past activities (operations) have 
generated all of the uproar . 
Whether or not those acti vities 
were necessary or effective are a 
matter of opinion and are not at 
issue here. It is a simple-minded 
romantic fantasy to think tbat the 
CIA ad was fishing for operatives, 
super·spies, hit men, 007 cloak and 
dagger spooky types "to en,ale in 
terrori.t activities around the 
world." The purpose of the ad was 
simply to recruit well ,educated, 
technically skilled people to be part 
of the sedentary majority of 
Agency employees that process 
information. 

It is naive and typically narrow 
minded to confuse a very necessary 
intelligence effort with scary 
covert operations. 

It is inane to suppose that the 
country can function withoutsound 
intelligence, 

It is romantic and adolescent to 
think that the CIA was attempting 
to recruit operatives in a place like 
UCSD, even if they needed them. 

Unrealistic sheltered viewpoints 
of the world, paranoia, or an 
anarcbistic political slant would 
naturally have caused one to be 
offended by the advertisements in 
question.

Tennis TIDS 
"Give 'em a chance" 

After a tough day at the office, Herb is looking forward to an 
afternoon of fast-paced tennis. His opponent today is Woody 
Backboard , who, by the way, hasn't missed a ball since June of '57. 
But Herb is not worried. He plans to use his cannonball serve. Herb 
will blow his opponent off the court with unbelievable accuracy. 
Herb has delusions of grandeur. 

The opponent, on the other hand, plays a different game - some 
call him the dinker; others call him more nasty things. He is not 
blessed with accuracy nor speed nor sensual body movements. 
But he gets every ball back. He takes a few steps to one side, hits an 
elevator ball and innocently waits for it to land in Herb's court. He 
smiles at Herb as if to say, " Here isanotherchance - will you take 
it? " If Herb manages to get the ball back , Woody repeats the same 
procedure and says " Here it comes again - why don ' t you miss 
this one? " 

Herb lost and is now obviously upset, " Why don 't you play like a 
man - you 're driving me up the wall! .. Dinkers have learned an 
important secret which gives them bigger numbers when they say 
the score: they let their opponents make the mistake. They know 
most matc~es are won by letting the opponent beat himself. 

Dinke~s probably don 't have many frIends . They probably don't 
have. tIme for them . They're too busy dusting off their trophies!!

Music is an immediately acceuible art fonn; if perfonned 
correctly it affords the listener a llimpse at the heaR of the 
compoeer. Juz takes thJa accessibility a giant step further , by 
means of ill biJb1y improvisational nature. Within ill relatively 
loose structure, an accomplished musician can express bis own 
mocM:t more freely than, say, the third violin in an o~stra. Of 
course, to be able to express in this way, the musician must reach a 
level of proficiency such that there is hardly a lap between 
tboqbt and action, coDlCioumeu and "physical-ness." Both 
Herbie Hancock and C~k Corea bave come a long way toward 
reacbiDl this level of musical proficiency, as they amply demon-
strated last SUDday nilbt at Golden Hall. 

Throulbout two bour-loDl sets, the two musicians showed a 
depth of uncIentandiDJ of jazz piano in leneral, and each other's 
music in particular, wbicb was breathtaldDJ to experience. They 
worked their way through Miles Davis' melliOous "Someday My 
Prince Will Come," Corea's resurlent "Homecominl," a 
numinously playful "Lisa", and a delilbtful percussive 
improvisation for the first set, then came back to perform a short 
Bartok duet, a solo improvisation each, and a medley of Hancock's 

for further Information "Maiden Voyale" and Corea's "La Fiesta." 
CONTACT While the set pieces were inapired and faithful renderiDls of the 

ALBION C(}RPORATION orilinals, I found the improvisations to be the eveniDJ's bilhest

SAN DIEGO, CAliFORNIA essence of jazz. Corea's solo, which he dedicated to .all the 

92121 musicians in San Diego, was a rich and varied piece of playiq. His 
abarp and disciplined left hand provided a superb backlround for

and phases, from meditative to thunderilll , touching down here 
and there into the blues. The blues, to which they returned for a 
short encore, was the least coherent piece of the evening. This is an 
interesting tribute to the artistry of the two; the rigid twelve-bar 
seemed to be too limiting for the vicissitudes of their creative 
minds. 

The show was conducted in a playful and informal maDDer, as if 
the two refused to over-solemnize what was indeed a momentous 
occasion for jazz fana. 

Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea are known primarily for their 
work with electronic keyboard instruments . While not 
disparaging these modes of expression, I must say that it was 
extremely refreshing to see these two return to acoustic pianos, 
familiar steel and wood, as a means of presenting their lovely 
musical ideas. As I return now to vinyl and diamond, it is 
comfortinl to have experienced the joy with which Herbie and 
Chick draw forth some of the endless possibilities of the piano.

OVER $650 A MONTH 
RIGHT YOUR 

If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 

It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify, 
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your 
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School, 
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 

'education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, 
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

It isn't easy. There are fewer than 400 openings and only 
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make 
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training 
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs 
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy 
later .. (But we don~t think you'll want to.) . 

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a 
Navy representative when he visits the campus on February 21-23, 
or contact your Navy representative at 714-2.93-6444 (collect). 
If you prefer, send your resum~ to the Navy Nuclear Officer 
Program, Code 312-B468, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, 
Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly. 
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help 
you finish college: it can lead to an exciting career opportunity.

pointed out seven of the 15 
images which he says appear in 
the ice cubes in the picture. 
Plainly visible to the audience 
who was shown enlargements 
of the ice cubes were a monster, 
a man with a turban and cobra, 
a melting, screaming face, a 
small animal, a devil 's mask 
and body , and a raven (a 
symbol of death) with his 
,. peeker" - an erect penis 
shadowed by a skull. Key said 
that the nightmare images are 
those which alcoholics envision 
during withdrawal.

nently .tated "She .till does." 
He pointed out that the mother 
was holding up the drell of the 
little girl in the picture, and that 
the mother's left hand was not 
visible to the viewer. Key felt 
that the use of the pose played 
on the terror that parents feel of 
child molestation. 

"Media has a potential for 
dignity and worthwhile human 
purpose," said Key , adding 
that the media will not change 
anything if it can help it. He 
cited the Martin Luther King 
special on television which he 
felt was "well done," and yet 
King's assassination was 
followed by a dog food com-
mercial. He felt that the reason 
such injustices occur is because 
" people avoid what upsets 
them." 

Constitutional Review ••. 
(Continued from page 1) 
commissioner duties and powers. A current problem with the 
commissioners is that they do not now know what policy areas they 
are responsible for, Lofgren said. 

The legislative subcommittee is now looking at the tStanding 
committee structure and will then examine the actual makeup of 
the legislative decision-making process, Rodli said. 

Lofgren said the task force can loosely interpret the mandate 
given it by the original AS resolution, drafted early this quarter by 
Moser and Third College representative Mike Estrada. Among the 
task force 's considerations are: 

- The question of whether the commissioners should sit on the 
council . Some task force members seem to feel removal of the 
commissioners would allow a stricter separation of executive and 
legislative functions, and so make for greater efficiency. 

Under this system, commissioners would set policy in their 
policy areas, and initiate legislation, the council would act on 
legislation and the president would initiate and veto legislation. 

More representatives? 
-The addition of more representatives to the council. With the 

removal of commissioners, the council would be left with only 12 
members. Lofgren said the council could be expanded to include 
five representatives from the college.
