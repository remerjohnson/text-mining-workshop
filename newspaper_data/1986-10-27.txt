By KAREN KUMM 
and GUSTAVO SANTOYO 

This IS the first oj a two-part enes. 

I 1'S a Wednesday night and the UCSD women's volleyball team is involved in a hard , tough match. Their concentration 
level is inten~se, their anention focused solei}' 
on the ball and the court. Their team work is 
beauty to watch as they constantly back each 
other up in every facet of the game. The serves 
are beautiful, the setS float off the sener's 
feathery touch, and the spikes are devastating. 
All this has helped the Tritons gamer the 
position as the best DiviSIOn 1Il volleyball team 
in the nation. 

Yet the number one ranking has been unable 
to lure the suppOrt of the UCSD populace 
Triton Pavillion remains half empty for most of 
ItS matches and although low anendance has 
plagued UCSD athletics since I(S inception , 
thiS season has been especially frustrating for 
head coach Doug DanneVlk. 

"I'm very disappointed With the crowds that 
have come out to our games this year," said 
Dannevik. ~I'm sure anendance I down fr.~m 
the last three or four years and last year I didn 't 
thmk we had the ex ItIng pcrsonalimes we do 
thl year I think If people come once, they'll 
orne again , but I'm nor ure why people aren 't 
omlng out this year." 

Attendance figures so far thiS yc r can atte.st 
that there are more people at the Pub than at a 
volleyball game on a Fnday mght. Last season's 
biggest draw came in a match again t 801 t' 
tate with 350 fans invading Triton PavillIOn 

The team was able to anract three crowd of 
over 300. 

This year's crowds, however, have been ltm 
plckln . This year's biggest crowd wa the BGIF 
game against Cal tate Dominguez Hills, but the 
attendance figure was nor kept for that game 
in e there was no admls ion charged at the 

door. Officially, 250 people attended a Saturday 
night game versus the University of laVerne , 
the team UCSD lost to In last year' Western 
Regional Final. 

The decline in attendance ha been a 
stery to Dannevik , who penly tated that

Regents discuss 
possible new UC 
By PAMElA CEREN, LIe Wilt' 

The possibility of a 10th U campus and the quaht>· 01 
undergradua te education were dIscussed at Ihe UC Regents 
meeting October 16 at UCI. 

By the year 2000, there might be a new UC campus at 
Fresno. Regent Leo Kolligl'\I1 , an attorne>' lrom Fresno. II1111aled 
the it!ea bUI was laughed at by the other regellis. 

"Pick a locatIon on th e coastitne ," UCI Chance llor Jack 
Pe1tason said jokingly. 

After some dI SC USSIon, vIews changed . U PreSIdent DaVId 
Gardner praised fresno because of its COSt crfectl\'eness <Inc! its 
northern location , bur l11ade no deciSIon regarc!lI1g a new 
campus. 

"T he new campus IS not imminent, but th e prospect IS there . 
We have an intere t in several parts of the state . but Fresno is 
good becausc there is nothing in the Centr.d Va lle>' area ." 
Gardner saId . 

Gardner did not guess how much the new sc hool woulLl cost 
the regents , but sa Id he would be surpnsed if the COSt was 
more than the ot her UC campuses. 

Gardner saId UO and UC San Diego might (3P theIr 
enrollment If s lles do not expand . 

UC Berkeley's student population WIll II1crea~c abnur Ihree 
percent br the ycar 2UOO anLl UCLA's WIll incn::ls.: 5 percent. 

The ama Cruz, San Diego and Riverside campuses \\,111 havc 
the highest increase in enrollment with percentages of 210. 160 
and 130 re pecuvel>" according to a rege nt report. 

Temporary classroom space and faculty are beil'1g added t 
handle the immediate problem , but Gard ner thinks th.1t the 
problem will dltnll1lsh as the campu es arc more e4U1pped to 
handle the student II1flux . 

To better handle thIS II1crease, a ta~k force headed by 
Bcrkele>, professor Ned Smel er presented a repon to the 
regellis on lowe r-division educatio n In the UC s>'stem. 

The repon suggested expansion of freshman.-sophomorc 
seminars, broader general requirements and the enhancement 
of international . multicultural and global learning. 

The report encouraged the acceptance of foreign studcms 
because . according to the repon. 60 percent of them stay in the 
country or return to thei r native country to become prominent 
leaders. 

Roben Noyce, chai r of the Committee on Educational Policy. 
disagreed. "The UC system is spending $50,000 a year LO get 
students green cards. That's absurd ," he sa id . 

The debate com inued with Noyce and Regent Vice President 
William Frazier volleying the local contributions of foreign students 
back and forth . 

No decisions were made, but a study will be presented at the 
next meeting.

Prop. 65 uncovers toxic pollutants 
By JOHN SHAW 

P ROPOSITION 65, a measure designed to restrict toxic pollution and 
to warn people of exposure to

along~lde a mulmude 01 other

the o d and chemIcal compa l1lcs

simply stated , "There are a 
va rtety of opponents." 
, "Zchau is very much in favor 
of cleaning up tOxic waste in 
California ," Ward saId . 
"However, he is opposed 10 
Prop . 65 on the ground that I[ 
i<; poorly worded and ill-
conceIved." 

The mea ure "concerns an 
arbitrary hmlt on the percentage 
of IOXICS lhat can be put 1Il10 the

Gorham . 

Ed Zc hau and many other 
opponents of Prop 65 conte nd 
that there are plemy of laws 

restricting LOXIC pollu tion on the 
books already. "What we need is 
be tter enforcemem of our 
existing laws." Ward said . 

Gorham c1allns that the 
maJomy of the Il 'Xll re~trlctmg 
1,lw. are fcder.tl laws "We ca n'l 
count on the Reagan 
Admll1lStralion to cnlorce the e 
laws. The federal govemment 
doesn 't have the manpower to 
clean-up all 01 the roXIC ~lte S, 
thercl ore It IS up tl) the states to 
enact their own legIslation ." 
Gorham saId . 

Opponem <; of Prop 61 cha rge 
that many farmers WIll be hurt , 
because they won 't be able to use 
some of theIr hemlcals 
anymore . Gorham says, "The 
family farmers employing less 
than LO people wi ll not be 
affected by Prop. 65 . Only the 
corporate farmers WIll be 
regulated ." 

"PolitiCIans have a lOt to gam 
(from su pporting Prop. 65 )," saId 
Wart! . It IS very hard to oppose a 
tOXIC waste type issue ." Ward 
emphaSIzed the fact that "Zchau 
does suppOrt the Supe rfund and

·One of those" referred to an

reapplication , to the WritinB

explained that the new writing 
coordinator, Gerald DiCarlo, felt 
that there wa s "an excess of 
writing tutors" and to solve this 
dilemma, he was requesting 
returning tutors to reapply and 
undergo an additional interview 
to be reaccepted . 

Within one wee k of 
completing the above process, I

seasoned and newly-tramed,

at OASIS was mentioned. I feel 
thar my 140-hour time 
commitment , aSide from the 
personal commitment involved , 
consi tutes more than interest. 

I object ro the fact that aU 
returning Writi ng Tutors did nor 
receive the following: . 

l. Notification regarding the 
proposed reapplication process. 

2. Explanation regarding the 
reasons for the changes in the 
program. 

3. Apology regarding the 
disfavorable outcome for the 
di smissed tutors. 

4. Referral regarding the 
pos ibiliry of future employment 
at OASIS. 

Lastly, what tS the fate of 
forthcoming Writing Programs? 
Does Gerald DiCarlo plan to 
recruit and train more tutors 
than he plans to hire' If so, an 
obvIOUS ethical issue is at the 
root of the recent changes in the 
OASIS Writing Program. Such 
undiplomatic conduct is 
unprofessi0nal and indecent, ro 
say the least.

DeukmeJian won that election

percent of (he v teo A recent Los

Incumbent candidate ten 
percentage points ahead of 
Bradley in the current race , even 
though the latter has closed the 
gap by five points since a similar 
poll ""a stake n In early 
September. 

Los Angeles rna yor Tom 
Bradley highlighted his most 
recent San Diego campaign stop 
by making an appearance in 
Balb0a Park. This appearance 
kicked off a 1,000 mile re~to 
gather support in the last"Weeks 
before the election . The run is 
scheduled (0 wind its way 
through California for twelve 
days. Its final destination is 
Sacramento. 

Bradley's assi tant press 
secretary, John Swdder, said the 
"relayJ,!..jtneant to gather grass

than for fund-raiSing 
purposes ". we don't expect to

heavily on televiSion, Bradley 
deCided to revert 10 "old-
fashioned campaigning' to 
combat the govemor's media 
strikes. Slodder said, "we have 
no one target group ... we want to 
attract the labor union member 
to the young black 
executive ... the wealthy to the 
not so wealthy." 

The feeling around the Bradley 
camp is that through this 
cooperative relay, people 
th roughout California can be a 
pan of the mayor's run to the 
state capitol. "We feel ," Stodder 

~at thirty second ads are 
~ough. If these television 

Spots are the main message 
getting out to the people, they 
are nOl geaing the whole 
picture." 

The raUy is nOl JUSt a ative

the incumbent's fi nancial 
resources. "The governor has 
approximately five million doUars

Fu rther, she speculated that 
Bradley's reserves faU short of 
this figure .

DeukmeJians's expenditures tOlal 
eight 10 nine million dollars, 
while Bradley's tab stands at 
about five million dollars. 

Regardless of the exact figu re , 
the ra e to Sacramento has been 
an expensive one. Most of the 
money has gone toward slashing 
television commercials . To 
illustrate the financial magni tude 
of th e current campaign , 
Professor Samuel Popkin, of the 
UCSD Political Science 
Department, pointed out that the 
combined budget for th~ current 
senate and gubernatorial races in 
California will tOlal about 30 
million dollars~figure 

represent~ximate 
amount spent on a presidential 
election. 

Although Deukmejian may 
have bought more air time than 
Bradley, the caliber of the 
Campaign commercials has been 
Similar. 

For example, a recent 
Deukmejian television 
advertIsement presents the 
governor criticizing Bradley for 
his use of celebnties in hiS paid 
political announcements. 
DeukmeJian states, • ... If Bradley 
can't speak for him elf, how can 
he lead Cali fornia?" In the same 
30 seconds , Deukmejian 
reaffirms his opposition to Rose 
Bird, and points out that Bradley 
"won't take a stand" on the is ue . 
Bradley's attacks on the governor 
have been imilar in format and 
coment.

But women's volleyball has

come out to the game . but they 
aren't." 

Several theories have been 

pondered as to the root of this 
problem and Dannevik feels that 
maybe the promoting of the team-
has not been up to par. "We do the 
best Job of developing the 
volleyball program . better than any 
other DIVlSlOn III chool in the

'The Fleas' continue biting Division I dogs 
By CHARLES TABESH, Staff Wnter 

I MAGINE the UniverSIty of ebraska football team compenng in the NFL. 
Or picture the double A 
Beaumont Padres plaYing in rhe 
National Le;Jgue . It doesn't eem 
fair. you say} 

O.K. .II 's not qUlle that drasn 
BUl the fact that the UCSD men 
water polo team su cessfully 
comperes in an open dIVISion IS 
stlll pretty impreSSIve. It means 
that. even though UC D I a 
DIVISIon III school. It plays 
agaInst D1I'ISlo n II and DIVISIon I 
oppont.'nh 

So what? \Vhat' the 
dIfference} WeU , unltke man}' of 
the teams thaI II competes with . 
UC D IS not allowed to offer 
scholarshIps to the players II 
would ltke to aaran. ObVIOusly. 
thIS creates a tremendous 
dIsadvantage 

~ll means, on a scale to ten , 
we have to go after the fives , 
sIxes. and sevens. and 
sometimes eIghts." Coach Harper 
saId m referring LO the players 
that he recruIts. When trying to 
lure some of the better players. 
Harper uses the chance to play 
right away as bait. If they were to 
aaend a DIVISIon I school like 
UClA, or Cal. [he)" would have 
to sit on the bench their first 
couple of years whIle 
expenenced seniors and JUniors 
were plaYI ng. 

But that still docsn't explain 
the team's abIlity to ompete 
effectively oach Harper claIms 
that the team' tough traming 
schedule I the key, "We train 
harder than anybody," he said . 

The water polo program runs all 
year at UCSD. but the "scrious" 
season IS dunng the fall . The 
players have curfews and stud y 
sessions thIS quarter and [rJln 
VIgorously. They just finished a 

Tritons bomb the Nr Force 
By BRIAN lTOW, Staff wnltr I 

W HAT was that olet Playing tremendous defense , Irish proverb about UCSD coumerauacked the the third time being Falcons to death , scoring seven 
a charm? Well , it didn't prove counterattack goals . . Harper felt 
true for the Air Force Falcons in the Tritons o nly g<lve up one 
their third meeting with the . legitimate goal as the other 
UCSD water polo team. Falcon goals were helped out by 

Already having defeated the a bit of luck. 
Falcons twice this season, the Captain Jeff Heidmous. the 
Tritons were 0Ul to prove thar Falcons head coach. agreed with 
[ht victories MR no fluke, They Harper's assenions. "We played 
did that in a convincing fashion. p retty gOod defense, but bur 
thC?roughly dominating the action offense was pathetiC," said 
en route co a 12-4 V\clOry over Heidmous. ~It was so bad that an 
the Academy. UCSD had to do was ~t back on 

The vtqory ~s crucial to tht dt;iensc and think about the 
folD'teendt ranked Tritons. With cow1terattack.~ 
Air Force ranked right behind Heidmous summ~d up the 
UCSD, TrylOo head coach Denny ) g,une by saying, "They beat us up 
Harper saw the importance of and down the pool. We're luel<y 
this game. ·We wanted-ro make they only won pyeight." 
a statement: >aid Harper. ·With The Tritons next home game 
a team· ranked right behind us is against five time national 

'losing by mar much, it proves champion Cal (like in Berkeley) 
that we should be ranked . Friday at 3:30 in the 
higher." . Canyonview pool. ~ 

mid-season span of twO weeks 
without playing. and the time 
was used for inrense. three hour 
workouts five days a week. 

Harper COined the nicknamc 
"neas" for his team. Why? 
"Because we're small , very qUICk. 
and we 're hard to kill " ThiS 
SChon ha produ ed mIxed 
re:.ult for Ihc Fleas. The team 
started OUI at t-5 . bUl has come
