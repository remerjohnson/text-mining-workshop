The Orange Country District Attorney decided not to charge 
UC Irvine senior Jesse Cheng with sexual battery. Cheng is the 
current UC Student Regent, the only student who is allowed a 
vote on the board.  

A 22-year-old UCLA Law School student identified as “Laya” 
accused Cheng of sexually assaulting her on Oct. 3, 2010 and 
reported the crime on Oct. 26. Cheng was arrested on Nov. 4 
based on Laya’s accusations.

The District Attorney’s office decided not to press criminal 
charges against Cheng in December, citing lack of evidence as the 
reason for dropping the case. 

“[W]e cannot file a case unless we can prove the case beyond 
a reasonable doubt,” Orange County District Attorney Chief of 
Staff Susan Kang Schroeder told New University.  “And in this 
incident, we could not. The deputy on this case was not aware 
of any position that Cheng held, nor would it have made a 
difference.”

Laya presented e-mail evidence from 
Cheng in which he apologized for allegedly 
committing the crime.

“I’m sorry for sexually assaulting you,” 
wrote Cheng on Oct. 19. “I am a horrible 
person for what I did for [sic] you. I tried 
to rape you, and I thank you every day for 
not letting me do that to you.”

The incident came to light after Laya 
approached New University with the situation.

“I was scared Jesse would retaliate and with someone in his 
position, he has people around him who can and who have gone 
out of their way to silence me and convince me not to report the 
assault,” Laya said in the Feb. 16 issue of New University.

Cheng spoke on the record for the first time this week, after 
months of silence. Due to an ongoing investigation, he finally 
clarified the matter.

“I am innocent of all accusations made,” Cheng said in a 
statement. These accusations have been extremely painful ... My 
former partner and I were in a committed relationship for almost 
a year. Near the end of the year, it was clear that the relationship 
was not working out, and I initiated the break up.”

Cheng explained why he responded to Laya’s e-mail.
“She was calling me 50 times a day for two hours on the 

phone a day,” Cheng said in a statement. “To be honest, my life 
was cracking because of these phone calls. They were extremely

The steam machines that custodians use to clean stu-
dents’ dorms and apartments have become a safety issue. 
A.S. Council is now encouraging the Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality department to ban them.

Campuswide Senator Victor Flores-Osorio proposed 
the resolution against steam machines at a Feb. 16 coun-
cil meeting. The resolution aims to call HDH’s attention 
to safety concerns and conspicuous water usage.

The machines operate at temperatures above 240 de-
grees Fahrenheit, and have caused about 28 custodians 
to report injuries — such as steam burns, nerve damage, 
chronic neck pain and back pain — to HDH this quarter. 

Flores-Osorio said he counted the number of injured 
workers by speaking with custodians and the Student 

Workers Collective.
Many of the custodians are over the age of 50, so 

Flores-Osorio said it makes them vulnerable to back in-
juries in transporting the heavy machines on the stairs.

Custodians use the Karcher DE 4002 steam clean-
ers — which cost about $1,000 — to sanitize bathroom 
surfaces, such as showers and counters. According to the 
online petition, these machines have a capacity of 10.5 
gallons, but HDH only allows its workers to use 1 gallon 
of water per machine.

According to the manufacturer’s website, however, 
the machine can produce up to 1,585 gallons of steam 
from its boiler capacity — which has 1.2 gallons with a 
run time of a maximum of five hours.

A fee referendum of $22 to maintain student recreation facilities, such as the 
Canyonview swimming pool and two 
jacuzzis, was  approved at the Feb. 
23 A.S. Council meeting for Spring 
Quarter’s all-campus election. 

If students pass, the measure — 
proposed by  Sports Facility Advisory 
Board — will take effect Fall Quarter 
2013 to renew the 1981 student 
recreation facilities’ $12 fee that lasted 
30 years. 

The fee would continue funding 
the construction, maintenance and 
operation of the pool, two Jacuzzis, 
five racquetball and handball courts, 
and a shower and locker room located 
north of the Warren West Field, as well 
as night lighting on the Muir Field.

If passed, $6.38 of the collected 
fees, or 29 percent, will go back to 
financial aid.

The proposed fee increase will 
not be added to the current RIMAC 
activity fee of $92 per quarter, but 
act as a line-item agenda for separate 
expenses. The fee proposal is partially 
in response to the Return-to-Aid 
financial policy that was not included 
in the original referendum.  

According to Campuswide Senator 
Anish Bhayani, the proposed fee 
increase is also due to inflation the last 
30 years. 

“To follow the numbers exactly, 
inflation from 1981 to now would 
result in a higher fee than $15.62, but 
since the debt for the construction of 
these sports facilities has been paid 
off, the fee is reduced to maintenance, 
operations and improvement,” Bhayani 
said.

According to Sports Facilities 
Planning and Management Director 
Donald Chadwick, the $22 fee 
is determined by three factors: the 
Canyonview Aquatic Center’s current 
operating expenses, enrollment 
projections and the return-to-aid 
fraction.

The $22 increase will generate 
around $1.8 million per year for 
operations and maintenance, 
including the three quarters and 
summer sessions. That figure assumes 
about 26,938 students for the academic 
year — including undergraduates, 
graduates and students at UCSD 
School of Medicine and Skaggs School 
of Pharmacy — and 10,080 students 
during the summer sessions. 

The $1.3 million of expenses 
for maintaining the Canyonview 
facility includes $294,743 for staff 
salaries, $34,895 for the weight room 
and $825,730 for maintenance and 
operations. There is also $25,000 
for temporary funds and capital 
equipment and a reserve contribution 
of $126,000. 

“I also see benefit in this fee,” 
Bhayani said. “Much more money will 
be flowing into financial aid because 
of this new fee, which will assist 
those who are struggling to make all 
their payments. The actual fee is not 
increasing by much, only accounting 
for inflation.” 

Bhayani said that if the referendum 
is not passed, sport teams and the 
aquatics department would suffer the 
most due to increased enrollment. He 
said the facilities would be increasingly 
unavailable for practice use.

“Although the debt service for the 
complex is retired, operational costs 
remain a continuing cost that rises 
with inflation,” Chadwick said. “There 
is not another mechanism in place to 
pay for these services so, unless the fee

Researchers Discover How Neurons Wire Brain in Embryos
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Nisha Kurani
Associate News Editor

Researchers have discovered 
how nerves wire the brain during 
embryonic development. The findings 
provide insight into generating new 
therapies for spinal cord injury patients 
suffering from nerve damage.

Using spinal tissue from mice 
embryos about 11 days into gestation, 
neurobiology associate professor Yimin 
Zou and his research team uncovered 
how nerve pathways are paved during 

the early stages of development, when 
cells disperse to specific regions to 
form the nervous system. Until now, 
people didn’t know how neurons 
moved and which chemical signals 
helped them.

The neuron movements are caused 
by growth cones, which are highly 
sensitive and motile structures located 
at the tips of growing nerves. The 
growth cones use Wnt proteins, which 
act as the molecules that move the 
neurons by creating a signal called 
planar cell polarity (PCP).

Although growth cones find their 
destinations by reacting to varying 
chemical cues in the developing 
nervous system, no one knew how they 
responded to the different chemical 
concentrations.

The findings also indicate the 
importance of the molecule Vangl2 — 
used in PCP to help the growth cone 
develop —  in leading the axon toward 
its target. The molecule is highly 
concentrated in the filopodia, which 
make up the tips of the growth cones.

“This suggests that the tips of the 

growth cone at the filopodia are the 
most sensitive part of the growth cone,” 
Zou said. “It is not the entire growth 
cone that is evenly sensitive.”

The research shows that Vangl2 
responds to the signals created by the 
Wnt protein, which tells the growth 
cone where to move. 

“While the growth cone is turning 
in a certain set of directions, the axon 
will grow longer, [which leaves] behind 
neuronal connections,” Zou said. 

The pathways neurons use to 
develop can be used in therapies for 
spinal cord injury patients.

During severe spinal cord injury, 
neurons that allow for sensory input 
and motor output are damaged, and 
patients lose sensation and movement 
below the affected area.

“After axons are damaged, they can 
no longer regrow, and we get paralysis,” 
Zou said. 

The axon guidance system can be 
used to help neurons grow by using the 
Wnt signaling mechanism to try and 
repair axons after spinal cord injury, 
for both sensory and motor systems

“Once development is over, these 
axon guidance systems are temporarily 
put to rest — they are not working 
anymore,” Zou said. “But if there is 
traumatic injury to the spinal cord, 
they can quickly re-induce those 
guidance systems.”’

President Wafa Ben Hassine praised council last night for having moved though 11 new 
business items at such a fast pace — 
three hours may be longer than the 
average meeting, 
but council got 
much more done.

Council passed 
the recreation 
facility fee 
referendum, which 
would charge $22 
per quarter to 
maintain facilities like Canyonview 
Pool. The referendum will go on the 
spring ballot as long as the Graduate 
Student Association passes it on 
March 7.

Council approved the appointment 
of Revelle College freshman Shounak 
Ghosh, Sixth College junior Polina 
Tsvetikova and Muir College 
freshman Kevin Hsaio as new judicial 
board members.

Council also approved a letter 
addressed to California Governor 
Jerry Brown in retaliation against 
the proposed $500 million cut to 
the UC system. There were a few 
amendments to the original letter, 
which included fixing punctuation 
errors and incorrect data.

Then council approved a 
resolution seeking justice for stem 
cell researcher Wilda Helen’s appeal 
process for her termination and 
possible deportation. 

The University Centers fee 
referendum of $5 — which changed 
the Consumer Price Index from five 
to two percent — was approved.

Ben Hassine introduced a survey 
for the technology fee — which 
charges $4 per unit for each student 
in its first year of implementation — 
to go on the Spring Quarter ballot. 
After many arguments about the 
confusing and misleading wording of 

the question, council approved it with 
a few amendments.

The athletics committee presented 
information from a 2010 report about 
the feasibility of bringing football to 

our campus and 
the feasibility 
of becoming a 
Division I school. 

To start  
football team, 
would cost 
between $20.8 and 
$33.8 million. Title 

IX states sports teams are required to 
have gender equality, so at least one 
other female sports team would be 
created alongside football. 

The startup cost of becoming 
a Division I school is about $11.5 
million. After that, an increase of 
at least $4.8 million in the athletics 
budget would be required. 

The committee’s recommendation 
was to concentrate on becoming a 
Division I school. They said a football 
team would not be feasible. 

AVP of Enterprise Operations 
Brian McEuen introduced Johnny 
Simkin, founder of SwoopThat — a 
website that serves as a go-between 
for online textbook vendors. 
Councilmembers liked the website, 
which shows users every textbook 
listed online and seller ratings. 

The site has a deal with Amazon.
com, where they receive an amount of 
every purchase. It then gives UCSD 
50 percent of the cut and our student 
government can decide what to do 
with it.

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu responded to Ben Hassine’s 
statement about quick meetings 
by posing the question of whether 
the meetings go quickly because 
councilmembers understand the 
issues they’re voting on, or because 
everyone’s in a rush to go home.

disruptive and I was extremely stressed 
out. So I lied in the e-mails to do 
whatever I could to move forward with 
my life.” 

Cheng also addressed the issue on 
a larger scale.

“I recognize the privileges that I 
have as a man, and I recognize that 
gender violence and violence against 
women is a serious issue,” Cheng 
said. “But I’m innocent. I’ve been 
working on those issues my entire 

college career. I would never engage 
in behavior that would compromise 
those values,” Cheng said.

New University received criticism 
from students for using condemnatory 
language against Cheng while only 
citing the anonymous source, Laya.

Students expressed doubts about 
the accuracy of New University’s Feb. 16 
“Student Regent Under Investigation” 
article.

“Personally to me, NewU has often 
inaccurately reported certain events 

(to some extent), especially this event,” 
one comment read.

Some also resented the article’s 
insinuation that Cheng was not 
charged due to his status.

According to New University, 
UCI Student Conduct office is still 
investigating the case.

Editors at the New University could 
not be reached for comment.

Campus Service Workers Will Submit Grievances to 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality on Steam Machines
Machines at UCSD,” claims campus service work-
ers used Diversey-Glance chemical products be-
fore starting to use steam machines this year to 
clean and disinfect surfaces.

The petition, which was launched on Jan. 28, 
said the discontinuation of the chemical products 
— which are considered environmentally friendly 
cleaning solutions — had a negative impact on the 
standard of hygienic cleanliness in all of the col-
lege dorms.

Flores-Osorio said that, although there is a 
benefit to not using chemicals, the machines re-
quire more water to adequately disinfect the hous-
ing facilities.

According to a custodian who wished to re-
main anonymous, HDH said they use steam ma-
chines because they are more environmentally 
friendly compared to chemical cleaners.

In addition, Flores-Osorio said the issue is also 
about the human rights of the workers.

“We wanted to point out the minor issue of the 
machines not being environmentally sustainable 
and link that to the greater issue at hand — fair 
labor rights or essentially just human rights,” he 
said. 

But the Student Work Collective and MEChA’s 
Trabajadores, which launched the Facebook peti-
tion, said there are more environmentally friendly 
alternatives that HDH is not considering due to 
the low costs of using steam machines that only 
require water.

Flores-Osorio took up the cause to promote a 
safe work environment for the custodians.

“A petition can only do so much here on cam-
pus, so they approached me, and it was something 
that I cared about also,” Flores-Osorio said.

Flores-Osorio said students and council mem-
bers support the resolution to ban the machines 
at the Feb. 16 A.S. Council meeting, though the 
proposal garnered criticism for its wording.

“Basically, council said it was too direct,” 
Flores-Osorio said. “The resolution made it seem 
like HDH was a villain. And I think that might 
have just been the Student Work Collective be-
ing passionate about situations [more] than them 
having one perspective of HDH. I work under 
Canyon Vista as a student supervisor, so I know 
that Housing and Dining have the best intentions 
when it comes to their workers and when it comes 

to students.”
Council discussed the merits of the resolution 

for about an hour and if it was the proper chan-
nel of action, as campuswide senator Michael Rai-
mondi stressed the need for careful deliberation.

Raimondi opposed passing a rushed resolu-
tion and wanted to discuss the issue during the 
meeting instead. 

Eventually, the resolution passed after edits. 
Council struck out a 
clause stating HDH 
refused to revoke the 
banning of the steam 
machines for being 
too directly critical of 
HDH.

A.S. Council Presi-
dent and HDH rep-
resentative Wafa Ben 
Hassine will present the 
resolution to Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality 
Advisory Committee 
on Feb. 28.

“If HDH [were] to 
ban steam machines, 
hopefully the workers 

won’t be in any risk of being injured again,” Flores-
Osorio said. “Any potential students [who] might 
have been around that area won’t be in any risk of 
being injured also.”

According to SWC, workers will be writing 
up a grievance against HDH pertaining to both 
their injuries and the inefficiency of the steam ma-
chines.

Flores-Osorio said student organization lead-
ers and he will be meeting with HDH administra-
tors.

“We are in the works of collaborating with the 
workers to meet with [HDH] prior to March 10 to 
hopefully alleviate the situation and permanently 
ban the machines,” Flores-Osorio said.

A March 10 press conference will be held at 
the Chancellor’s Complex by AFSCME 3299 — a 
union that represents 17,000 workers in the UC 
system.’

HDH director Mark Cunningham could not 
be reached for comment.

A referendum to increase 
University Center fees by $5 will be 
on this this year’s spring ballot and, if 
passed, will go into effect Fall Quarter 
2011. 

The referendum — presented to 
A.S. Council by University Centers 
Advisory Board Chair Nicole Metildi 
— would fund maintenance, support 
and repairs for Price Center and 
Student Center. 

Both undergraduate and 
graduate students will vote on the 
referendum when the final language 
is approved by both A.S. Council and 
the Graduate Student Association, 
according to Office of the President 
Press Secretary Reem Ateyeh. 

“Council and Wafa support it,” 
Ateyeh said. “It is an amount that 
students will be paying to keep one 
of the most used centers on our 
campus afloat. Students get the final 
say in whether they think this is an 
important enough increase.”

If passed, the quarterly fee — 
which would be raised from the 
current $76.50 to $81.50 per student 
— would return 29 percent of the 
proceeds to financial aid.

UCEN’s sole source of funding 
comes from student fees and vendor 
rates.

“The student fees are around 
63-65 percent of our budget,” Metildi 
said. “It wouldn’t exactly be feasible 
for us to seek funding elsewhere.”

The most recent draft of the 
referendum allows the fee to be 

adjusted annually based on the 
Consumer Price Index, with annual 
adjustments of no more than 2 
percent. 

The original referendum would 
have allowed annual adjustments of 
up to 5 percent. 

“If the fee does not pass, UCEN 
will most definitely need to cut 
hours of operation of the facilities 
and seriously consider charging 
[services],” Metildi said. “Students 
will see a deterioration in facilities as 
we will not be able to keep up with 
maintenance projects. “

University Center Director Paul 
Terzino could not be reached for 
comment.

EDiTORiAL

At a recent party, someone asked my friend which soror-ity she was in. Her response 
was immediately countered with a 
suspicious, “Do you do coke?”  This 
stereotyping of different chapters is 
an unfortunate occurrence for those 
of us in fraternities and sororities. 
Many people could name two-word 
reputations — good and bad —for the 
different chapters at UCSD. But more 
often than not, individual members 
don’t really fit the mold. 

When someone calls me a “soror-
ity girl,” I almost want to disagree, like 
I’m somehow the exception — but 
despite all the false stereotypes, I’m 
not. The clichés are all the more spe-
cialized (and random) for individual 
chapters: One anecdote seems to be 
enough for people to assume everyone 
in a chapter is Christian, a klepto or 
vegan. 

These stereotypes usually stem 
from some facts, but as with almost all 
stereotypes, the image is often exag-
gerated and only describes a few. For 
example, if a member of a frat takes 
advantage of a girl at a party, that frat 
is labeled the “date-rape” frat, even 
long after all of the members involved 
have graduated. 

Anyone in the Greek community 
will tell you that there’s too much vari-
ety within each chapter for a single 
label. Members in the same chapter 
don’t always hang out together, and 
it’s natural to not like everyone in the 
chapter — they are, after all, supposed 
to feel like family. (This is where 
“brothers” and “sisters” come to mean 
“people you are stuck with,” rather 
than “group of exclusive clones.”)

My closest friends at UCSD, in 
fact, are in other sororities or not 
affiliated at all, and it isn’t uncommon 
to come across an apartment of girls 
who all belong to different sororities. 
(It seems a little different for frat boys, 
for some reason — maybe due to the 
different rushing process, which often 
leads a group of existing friends to all 
rush the same frat.)

When I rushed last quarter, no 
one involved who knew the different 
sororities would share their impres-
sions of each chapter, to keep me from 
being swayed by a false impression — 
which I respected, though I was dying 
to know if I was about to pledge to an 
allegedly drug-addled chapter.

When I joined a sorority, I’d tell 
friends at other schools its name, 
which usually yielded a generic, one-
word response. One friend cut to 
the chase: “So, what’s your sorority’s 
stereotype?” Without a clear answer, I 
spat out adjectives that could describe 
any group of 100 people, and the 
only one that is true for everyone 
is “female.” The stereotypes vary by 
school, which makes it even harder to 
make sweeping generalizations. Every 
chapter tries to keep a good reputa-
tion, because every Greek represents a 
larger national organization. 

It’s sort of like different interna-
tional branches of McDonalds: There 
may be different options on the menu, 
but every establishment is built to the 
same brand standard. We are, after all, 
people with different interests and, if 
you’re still wondering, none of us have 
a coke a requirement.

This past week, UCSD’s Muslim Student 
Association hosted its 11th-annual Islam 
Awareness Week. This year’s theme was 
“Straight from the Source,” aimed at addressing 
misconceptions about Islam and Muslims. The 
MSA was on Library Walk Monday through 
Thursday with a mosque and poster exhibit 
about various topics such as the concept of 
God, Jesus in Islam, the role of Muslim women 
in society and the perspective of Islam on 
human rights. 

Along with the posters, free barbecue, 
spoken word, cotton candy and henna table, 
the Muslim students of UCSD were present to 
answer any questions their classmates posed. 
The atmosphere fostered dialog and education. 
One of the prime objectives of the MSA is to 
educate other students about their beliefs and 
way of life in order to advocate tolerance and 
understanding. The MSA’s doors are always 

open to the questions and ideas of all UCSD 
students, Muslims and non-Muslims alike; 
Islam Awareness Week is held annually to for-
mally provide a forum for conversation and 
education, with the ultimate goal of creating 
understanding among students at UCSD. 
     Islam Awareness Week was initiated with 
Dr. Jamal Badawi, a professor emeritus from 
St. Mary’s College in Halifax, Canada to speak 
about Commonly Misinterpreted Verses of the 
Quran. Often, many of us wonder what the 
Quran really states about violence and the 
honor of women, especially when these topics 
float across the screens of Western media with-
out any background, explanation or context. 

The following evening, the MSA held New 
Mosque on the Block, which focused on the 
lives, contributions and histories of Muslims 
in America, and also addressed the growing 
instances of Islamophobia in American cul-
ture. The presentation by Hussam Ayloush, 
Council on American-Islamic Relations direc-
tor for Orange County, showcased the lives 

and contributions of Muslims in America, like 
Malcolm X, Hakeem Olajuwan, Congressman 
Keith Ellison, Google executive Wael Ghonim 
and of course, UCSD students. Despite the per-
ceptions of Islam in the media, Islam reinforces 
the values of our Constitution, such as freedom 
of religion and speech, tolerance, coexistence 
and enhancing the society for the benefit of all. 

Thursday we held an event on women in 
Islam entitled Demystifying the Headscarf/
Hijab, featuring international journalist Yasmin 
Mogahed. Throughout the week we had a table 
on Library Walk offering information about 
women in Islam and also inviting students to 
take the challenge of wearing the hijab for a day. 
Many people were surprised to learn that the 
hijab is more than just a scarf, and that it also 
refers to the way we act and carry ourselves. 
Over 100 women decided to participate.

In the evening we held an event featuring a 
lecture on the idea of modesty, womanhood and 

Muslim Student Association: Threats Won’t Deter Our Efforts

Jane rho/Guardian

The student-led petition to ban steam cleaners has made important gains for 
custodians, and suggests that campus grassroots efforts aren’t all for naught.

In the Internet age, we’re no stranger to stagnant online petitions: Between appeals for a campus football team and more absorbent dining-hall 
napkins, no cause is too small for a new Facebook 
event. Most of these halfhearted efforts at activism, of 
course, don’t make it beyond the Firefox browser. But 
the Student Work Collective’s petition to ban steam 
cleaners has made its way to the A.S. Council floor, 
and will be presented to the campuswide Housing and 
Dining Committee this Monday. 

The Facebook event, which has 402 student 
attendees, is meant to bring awareness to the steam 
cleaners custodians use to sanitize bathroom surfaces. 
According to an anonymous HDH employee, the 
cleaners that operate at 240 degrees have injured 28 
employees since the beginning of the quarter. 

While the steam cleaners are a more eco-friendly 
alternative to chemical cleaners, and while UCSD 
prides itself on being such a green campus, people’s 
health should come first. And when it comes down to 
toeing the line between reducing HDH’s carbon foot-
print and employee safety, the employees always have 
to come first, whether this means looking into alterna-
tives or investing in more accident prevention training 
for the employees.

Unlike many of A.S. Council’s resolutions, which 
serve merely to take an ideological stance, this one 
is the first step toward change. Though the results of 
Monday’s presentation are up in the air, at least  the 
resolution’s existence shows HDH that students are 
concerned about the safety of UCSD employees. For 
a student government that, like any government, is 
notorious for its bureaucracy, it’s remarkable that this 
grassroots effort has gone from Facebook event to A.S. 
resolution to the Housing and Dining Committee with  
relative speed. 

Of course, even if HDH recognized its folly in 
using such dangerous machinery, the department’s not 
likely to immediately abandon the campuswide supply 
of steam machines, which run for about $1,000 apiece. 
There’s serious fiscal and environmental factors to 
consider, and if the department does decide to replace 
the steam cleaners, it’ll need to look into safer alterna-
tives that are as efficient and eco-friendly. 

Still, we have to hand it to the Student Work 
Collective. While banning steam cleaners might seem 
like a small-scale reform that won’t directly affect the 
lives of most students, it would be an important vic-
tory for on-campus custodians — and also sends the 
administration the boldfaced message that despite our 
campus’s now-notorious apathy, grassroots student 
reform isn’t so easily silenced.

feminism from an Islamic perspec-
tive. The participants came up and 
gave their reflections on the day. 
This brought tears to many of our 
eyes not because they highlighted 
the struggles we face as Muslim 
women, but because even in one 
short day, the women were able to 
see what so many of us Muslims 
often forget. The scarf has the trans-
formative power to act as a constant 
reminder for us to act with modes-
ty, charity and in 
remembrance of 
the true worth of 
our inner selves.

While this 
week was filled 
with enthusiasm, 
dialogue and 
learning, it did 
not come without 
its challenges. The 
previous week, a 
set of our post-
ers was defaced with hateful and 
discriminatory slurs. A group of 
San Diego Evangelical Community 
members picketed our displays and 
threatened both our members and 
other UCSD students. 

The administration, including 
Vice Chancellor Penny Rue, met 
us with resistance, refusing to send 
out an e-mail to the student body 
encouraging tolerance for all groups 

and people on campus, even after 
witnessing the consequences of dis-
crimination occurring around this 
time last year.

The goal of Islam Awareness 
Week was to educate the UCSD 
community in order to combat ste-
reotypes and foster tolerance. What 
I was not expecting was that even as 
an MSA member, I would learn and 
grow so much from this week. 

I saw firsthand the willingness 
of UCSD students to step into the 

shoes of another 
person, only to 
realize that their 
similarities out-
weigh their dif-
ferences and that 
true brotherhood 
and sisterhood is 
being able to see 
yourself within 
the struggles, 
hopes and suc-
cesses of another. 

I saw the power of interfaith 
dialogue in not only the effort to 
understand each other, but also in 
the power to build lasting friend-
ships. So maybe we should raise our 
goals beyond achieving tolerance, 
and realize the continuing need and 
powerful potential of education as a 
means for discovering the sameness 
and similarities of all of our goals 
and struggles.Dear Editor,

In regards to the article entitled 
“Ignoring All the Signs,” I would like 
to respond on behalf of the Christian 
preachers.

 First off, no one was there to 
“protest” anything. We made no men-
tion of Islam, Muslims, Mohammed, 
9/11 terrorists or anything else on our 
banners or our literature. All of the 
banners are the same ones we use on 
every campus and they only speak 
about Jesus Christ, sin and the judg-

ment to come, etc.
 No one was there to protest the 

Muslims and certainly no one said 
that “speaking to those people would 
land a person in hell.” In fact, that is 
the very purpose we visit any campus 
and that is to speak to people about 
their eternal destiny. We have love for 
Muslims, Jews, atheists, homosexu-
als and any other group regardless of 
their beliefs. Though sometimes some 
of the discussions get heated and 
people misunderstand our message, it 
is not one of hate but one of love for 
our fellow man, and concern for the 
eternal destination of their souls.

 We invite open dialogue with peo-

ple at all times about Christianity and 
are disappointed by the lack of will-
ingness by the Muslims on campus to 
allow free and open discussion.

D on’t hold your breath, “Black Swan” won’t take Best Picture this year. 
But director Darren Aronofsky’s 
knack for tapping into our inse-
curities makes for an unsettling 
movie-going experience unlike 
any other. 

“Black Swan” transcends 
logic as its simple premise dis-
integrates into a series of dark 
encounters: obsessive weight 
loss, self-mutilation and one of 
the most disturbing mother-
daughter relationships in recent 
cinematic memory. Yet despite 
the Gothic theatrics, the film 
never loses sympathy for its 
characters, creating a surreal 
tapestry of both realism and 
melodrama. 

Aside from Clint Mansell’s 
eerily pompous score and 
a triumphant performance 
by Natalie Portman, “Black 
Swan” is above all a statement 
of Aronofsky’s blaring impor-
tance in modern cinema. Like 
a burgeoning Stanley Kubrick, 
the director has honed his 
distinct voice, creating his first 
American classic and the best 
film of the year — an achieve-
ment that needs no validation.

D irector David O. Russell’s sports flick “The Fighter” could very well take the 
night’s biggest prize. The box-
ing film moves past the familiar 
underdog sports saga in its 
exploration of the relationship 
of two brothers, low-level boxer 
Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) 
and his half brother Dicky 
Edlund (Christian Bale), former 
boxer and current drug addict. 

Wahlberg’s compelling 
performance was snubbed for 
the Best Actor nomination, 
but both Bale and Melissa Leo 
— who plays the pair’s mother 
— are expected to win their 
respective supporting actor/
actress categories. Bale’s method 
acting and weight loss make 
Dicky a fully realized human 
being, while Leo’s performance 
balances humor with heart-
break. Despite her pushy nature, 
Leo is able to portray her as a 
caring mother. Combined with 
Russell’s direction, which pro-
vides the film with an essential 
sense of wit, “The Fighter” is 
one of the most compelling and 
entertaining films of the year, 
and a worthy Oscar recipient.

I nception,” like most block-busters, received astro-nomical hype — but unlike 
most, it deserved the attention. 
Directed by Christopher Nolan 
and featuring a star-studded cast 
including Leo DiCaprio, Ellen 
Page and Marion Cotillard, 
(not to mention ’95 UCSD grad 
Dileep Rao), the film crafted a 
heroic journey through mind-
bending dreams.

Unlike any of the other films 
in the category, “Inception” is a 
three-hour adrenaline rush that 
keeps you guessing, allowing 
you to watch shit blow up and 
think at the same time.  

Nolan put the estimated 
$160-million budget to good 
use: With jaw-dropping special 
effects — buildings fold over 
like a piece of paper, Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt sprints down the 
ceiling of a chic hotel — and 
grandiose sets (catch the Geisel 
snow fortress?), the visuals are 
unmatched. But it’s not all on-
screen flash — the conceptual 
gymnastics of the premise and 
the awe-inspiring scenery take 
a backseat to the best and old-
est trick in the book: interesting 
storytelling.

A prince is thrown onto the British throne and finds help for his ongoing stut-
ter so that he can rally the coun-
try together — sounds uplifting, 
doesn’t it? That’s exactly why 
“The King’s Speech” will likely 
take home the top prize come 
Sunday evening.

Colin Firth’s Bertie, aka King 
George VI, works with speech 
therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey 
Rush), forging a friendship that 
makes the film more buddy-
movie than war-time drama. 
Amongst the silliness of hum-
ming, arm flailing and Firth’s 
constant failure, there lies a 
story of perseverance (and boy, 
does the Academy love perse-
verance). 

Director Tom Hooper has 
the benefit of a pitch-perfect 
cast, which helps deliver a 
drop of history and a uniquely 
British experience, with all that 
signature dry wit. The film’s 
entertaining, inspirational and 
perfectly executed — making 
it a frontrunner over less feel-
good choices like “The Social 
Network” and “Black Swan.”

n early every year, Oscars pay tribute to the films that make strides in tell-
ing neglected gay narratives 
(e.g. “A Single Man,” “Milk,” 
“Brokeback Mountain”). As 
groundbreaking as they are, 
these films make gayness their 
primary focus, which is where 
“The Kids Are All Right” dis-
tinguishes itself: This isn’t a gay 
movie — it’s a family dramedy 
that happens to feature a pair of 
lesbian leading ladies.  

The finesse with which direc-
tor Lisa Cholodenko dodges that 
pitfall is what qualifies “The Kids 
Are All Right” for this year’s Best 
Picture award. With nuanced 
performances and subtle plot-
lines, it avoids “coming out of 
the closet” drama in favor of 
showing what a contemporary 
gay family looks like. 

The comedy even has school 
pride: UCSD theater grad 
Rebecca Lawrence (MFA ’09) 
takes a bit part as a dreadlocked 
white girl who makes innuendos 
to sperm donor Mark Ruffalo 
while heaving around a basket 
of organic vegetables.

c olin Firth, in all of his hesitant, twitchy, stammering glory, will take home the prize for his role as King George VI in “The King’s Speech.”While it might seem possible that young stars James Franco or 
Jesse Eisenberg could pull off an upset (for “127 Hours” and “The Social

claiming victories at the Golden Globes, the Critics’ Choice and the Screen 
Actors Guild Awards. The reason’s simple: Firth’s portrayal of the speech-
impaired George VI is without a doubt the subtlest, most masterful display 
of acting talent this year. 

The other nominees (Eisenberg and Franco in particular) put up strong 
performances, but none of them achieve the level of precise characteriza-

l ong before “Black Swan” hit screens, Natalie Portman’s transformation was all over the Internet. A year of regimented ballet lessons, the dramatic weight loss — it all seemed overhyped, and it was still difficult to imagine Queen Amidala tack-
ling the kind of dark, deeply personal roles we’ve come to expect of director Darren 
Aronofsky. 

Yet from the opening scenes of the film, it is immediately clear just how much 
Portman lost herself in the performance. She captures every minute detail of ballerina 
Nina Sayers’ complexity — her fragility, her fear, that deep-lingering evil — and the 
effect is truly unnerving. By harnessing an emotional range well beyond her years, 
Portman navigates warped mother-daughter interactions, giddy high-school joy and 
disturbing animal ferocity to a frighteningly real degree. The protagonist and villain 
are such a stark contrast that at times, it’s easy to forget they’re the same person. 

Like Heath Ledger in “The Dark Night,” Natalie Portman pushes the craft in brave 
new directions, gracing audiences with the thrilling experience of witnessing her full 
metamorphosis. Her performance in “The Black Swan” is one of those rare, instantly 
iconic moments in cinema, heralding the definitive presence of a great actress.

k nown mostly as “the film in which James Franco cuts his arm off,” Danny 
Boyle’s (“Slumdog Millionaire”)
fast-paced docudrama “127 
Hours” packs every frame with 
high-energy entertainment. 

You read that right: Self-
amputation is entertaining. 

The cramped premise — 
mountain climber Aron Ralston 
(James Franco) gets lodged 
underneath a boulder, spend-
ing the titular length of time 
struggling to get out — should 
have been unfilmable. But Boyle 
makes it work with a heavy dose 
of stylistic adrenaline: Saturated 
flashbacks are cut between 
harrowing moments in the 
desert; A.R. Rahman’s organic, 
guitar-driven score weaves you 
through the plot, exploding at 
its climax; split screens whiz by 
at a frenetic pace. 

Most importantly, Franco 
gives his most nuanced per-
formance to date. In the midst 
of Ralston’s nightmare, he 
transitions from paralyzed fear 
to exhausted delirium and sur-
vivalist exaltation in a way that 
is so natural, so pure, it hardly 
feels like acting.

A s calculated as its pro-tagonist, “The Social Network” brings 
together the biggest talent in 
Hollywood — David Fincher’s 
subtle directorial hand, Aaron 
Sorkin’s cutting screenplay and 
Trent Reznor’s infectious score. 
Loaded with cinema’s bright-
est young actors, the film is 
less concerned depicting the 
semantics of big business than 
the alienation, hatred, insecurity 
and youth of today’s tastemak-
ers. In the captain’s seat, Jesse 
Eisenberg secures his first Oscar 
nod as Facebook founder Mark 
Zuckerberg, spitting Sorkin’s 
lines with expert timing.

But in the pre-Oscar shuffle, 
the film somehow went from 
being a sure thing to an under-
dog. But despite “The King’s 
Speech”’s nomination lead, “The 
Social Network”’s sure wins in 
the directorial, screenplay and 
score categories bodes well 
for the drama.  “The King’s 
Speech” may have a historical 
background, but “The Social 
Network” has the future of the 
Internet at its virtual fingertips.

w ith flawless animation and a tearjerker of a script, Pixar’s “Toy 
Story 3” had viewers laughing 
and crying as Buzz, Woody and 
the gang fought all the odds 
to get back to Andy from the 
clutches of a corrupt daycare.  

Director Lee Unkrich 
avoided the sequel slump by 
maintaining the signature “Toy 
Story” charm. Despotic day-
care leader Lots’O — voiced by 
southern-accented Ned Beatty 
— was the surprise antagonist 
bent on stopping Spanish Buzz 
and his amigos from fleeing 
Sunnyside Daycare.  

The film succeeds where 
other nominees don’t, however, 
by forcing viewers of all ages to 
bawl their eyes out. The toys’ 
final moment with Andy was the 
poignant ending the saga needed 
— and a damn good excuse for a 
quick cry in the aisles.  

The film continues Pixar’s 
blemish-free legacy, achieving 
a sense of warmth that most 
films — animated or not — fail 
to reach. So to all those who 
thought that “Up” was snubbed 
last year, stay tuned: This could 
be the animated breakthrough.

A fter more than two decades of critical acclaim, the Coen 
brothers have become such an 
integral part of the Academy 
Awards that it’s easy to overlook 
just how powerful their film-
making still is. Their adaptation 
of the darkly comic Charles 
Portis cult novel is a resilient 
reminder that the hardest work-
ing duo in filmmaking is still a 
force to be reckoned with. 

Like their 2008 Best Picture 
winner “No Country for Old 
Men,” “True Grit” is another 
shoot-’em-up western with seri-
ous style, consisting of the stark 
cinematography and multidi-
mensional characters that are 
so distinctly Coen. This time 
around they’ve replaced “No 
Country”’s meditative, score-
less approach with thundering 
Protestant hymns, whip-crack-
ing shootouts and one hilarious, 
ass-kicking grizzly of a U.S. 
Marshall played by the endlessly 
talented Jeff Bridges. 

Everything about “True Grit” 
is rough and masculine. And 
with a string of quiet, subdued 
releases this Oscar season, it’s a 
welcome change of pace.

S tuck in a perpetual, muted frost, “Winter’s Bone” seems at an 
immediate disadvantage to its 
flashier peers.  But it’s remark-
able in its realism — “Bone” 
lays bare the unsung hard-
ships of struggling middle 
America, opting to strip its 
actors of heavy make-up and 
fancy lighting while expos-
ing them to caked-on grime, 
dried blood, rocky terrain and 
a scorched, desolate country-
side. 

The bare-bones approach 
paid off — both Jennifer 
Lawrence (for her unflinch-
ing, hardnosed Dee) and John 
Hawkes (as the menacing 
and slight Teardrop) earned 
Academy nods. Though the 
indie flick may be the dark-
est “Best Picture” horse, its 
unflinching examination of 
human perseverance is the 
truest show of cinematic grit 
this year. In an Oscars race 
in which major plot conflicts 
include such white-collar 
problems as a billion-dollar 
lawsuit and a competition for 
a ballet lead, we could all use a 
touch of “Bone”’s reality.

Nina Sayers’ complexity — her fragility, her fear, that deep-lingering evil — and the 
effect is truly unnerving. By harnessing an emotional range well beyond her years, 
Portman navigates warped mother-daughter interactions, giddy high-school joy and 
disturbing animal ferocity to a frighteningly real degree. The protagonist and villain 
are such a stark contrast that at times, it’s easy to forget they’re the same person. 

Like Heath Ledger in “The Dark Night,” Natalie Portman pushes the craft in brave 
new directions, gracing audiences with the thrilling experience of witnessing her full 
metamorphosis. Her performance in “The Black Swan” is one of those rare, instantly 
iconic moments in cinema, heralding the definitive presence of a great actress.

david FinCher - “the soCial networK”
Joel and eThan coen - “True GriT”

D avid Fincher (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac”) — long overdue for a Best Directing Oscar — delivered a tour de force with “The 
Social Network.” With a relentless grasp on 
every aspect of the film, Fincher didn’t delete 
a word from Aaron Sorkin’s dense screenplay; 
instead, he demanded perfection, forcing his 
actors to nail the film’s now-signature fast-
paced dialogue. The first scene of the film, in 
particular, took a whopping total of 99 takes.

Others did fine work this year, too. Russell’s 
“The Fighter” and the Coen brothers’ “True 
Grit” are also indebted to their directors, but 
neither stand a chance against Fincher. The 
only real competition comes from Darren 
Aronofsky and his moody “Black Swan,” 
though it may prove too bloody for the 
Academy. (That cinematic aesthetic will likely 

be imitated in film schools for years.) Fincher, 
however, shoots for exacting perfection in 
“The Social Network” and for that, he should 
be awarded.

r egardless of how you feel about Jesse Eisenberg, the stylish cinematography or Trent Reznor’s brooding score, “The Social Network”’s screenplay — written 
by Aaron Sorkin — is nothing short of a masterpiece. What’s 
more, Sorkin, who also wrote outstanding screenplays for “A 
Few Good Men” and “Charlie Wilson’s War,” is long overdue 
for an Oscar victory. The other nominees are strong: “True 
Grit” and “Winter’s Bone” would ordinarily stand a strong 
chance, but sharp dialogue and intense personal interactions 
make “The Social Network” a shoo-in for the award. The 
film’s strength is a testament to the power of Sorkin’s writing.

V eteran screenwriter David Seidler took almost as long as his protagonist, Bertie, to find his voice, but the resulting script is Oscar bait.  “The King’s Speech” showcases tongue-in-
cheek humor comparable to Sorkin’s witty “The Social Network” 
(the frontrunner in the adapted category) and was a painstaking 25 
years in the making. The script’s an old Oscar favorite: a story of try-
ing, lifelong hardship miraculously overcome; the fact that British 
royalty’s featured front and center is just an added bonus. Though 
Seidler doesn’t have the established lead over his competitors that 
Sorkin does, his film’s late surge in popularity should only bolster the 
writer’s edge — making him damn near impossible to dethrone.

t his year’s Best Supporting Actress has three favorites in for the run-ning, with one of them only narrowly outshining her co-star.     Fourteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld’s breakthrough performance 
in “True Grit” was no supporting role, but her youth leaves her out of the 
running, while Aussie nominee Jacki Weaver’s “Animal Kingdom” is too 
under-the-radar for the Academy.

Amy Adams is back for a third grab for her feisty performance in “The 
Fighter,” but will lose in a face-off against co-star Melissa Leo, who has 
swept most of the prizes this season as the boxer’s hellcat mom.

Leo’s latest campaigning foibles (she designed her own Oscar ads), 
however, might have undone her in this popularity contest, paving the 
way to victory for second-time nominee Helena Bonham Carter as Queen 
Mum in “The King’s Speech,” the most nominated film of the night. 

But whatever faux pas she may have committed, it would be a crime to 
take away the gold from Leo’s dynamic performance come Sunday.

A fter years of abusing his body more than a bulimic school girl, Christian Bale’s method acting is finally churning out Oscar gold. Bale was unrecognizable 
as scrappy former pro-boxer Dicky, sporting darkened 
teeth, sweat-coated garb and an emaciated physique. His 
performance is electric: loudmouthed, stubborn, bleary-
eyed and spoken in an affected lisp, his Dicky is miles 
away from the aloof Batman. The clincher is Bale’s inter-
pretation of Dicky’s writhing, pained meth withdrawals on 
a prison bed. The retired boxer recovers quickly thereafter, 
though the same can’t be said of his awed audience.

BeSt orIgInAl ScreenplAy plaYreview

H edda Gabler, the backstabbing wife of men’s nightmares, has never been bitchier. The latest 
production from the UCSD Theater 
Department is an adaptation of 
Henrik Ibsen’s play that manages to 
contemporize the playwright’s 19th-
century dialogue while staying true to 
its dark humor. 

The play opens to Hedda ( Zoë 
Chao) and her husband George 
Tesman (Kyle Anderson) arriving 
home after their honeymoon. The 
newlyweds are a far cry from a match 

made in heaven: George cherishes 
a pair of ratty slippers while Hedda 
struts the stage in purple pumps; 
he taps away on his laptop, she taps 
her fingers on a grand piano. Ever 
the disgruntled wife, Hedda is disil-
lusioned by marriage, as she increas-
ingly feels neglected due to her hus-
band’s devotion to his studies. 

When a figure from the past, 
Eilert Lovborg (Hugo Medina) rolls 
into town hot off the heels of publish-
ing his latest manuscript, the unre-
solved tensions between the play’s 

characters 
rise to the 
foreground. 
Though 
Lovborg’s in 
a hush-hush 
relationship 
with Mrs. 
Elvsted (Sara 
Garcia), he 
formerly had a 

fling with Hedda — until she pointed 
a pistol at his face. He now taunts her 
by calling her out for her cowardice. 

Once George finds the manuscript 
of Eilert’s sequel carelessly dropped 
on the side of a road, Hedda snatches 
it from him, eager to foil the life of its 
author and prove she’s no coward. 

It’s an opportunity to shake up 
the ennui otherwise plaguing her 
daily life. Hedda spells it out for us: 
“I’ve been so dreadfully bored”; “I 
have talent for only one thing in life 
— boring myself to death.” What she 
ultimately does with the manuscript 
ends up unraveling the thread that so 
loosely ties all the characters to one 
another and to their own sanities.

As Hedda, third-year MFA stu-
dent Zoë Chao carries the weight 
of the discursive play on her petite 
shoulders. Her unfaltering swings 
from Hedda’s stoic glares to diabolical 
laughs make for a character that is 
wholly unpredictable and, with per-
fect comedic timing, reason enough 
to watch the play. So commanding is 
Chao’s take on Hedda that the other 

performances merely serve to com-
plement hers. The heartfelt dialogue 
that Medina and Garcia exchange, for 
example, ends up exhibiting Hedda’s 
judgmental ways as soon as Chao 
interrupts with one-word quips. 
(Her ritzy accoutrement also helps 
keep our eyes glued onto her. Think 
Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago”—
Louise Brooks bob, garish getups, and 
all that jazz.)

Under the direction of second-
year MFA student Anthony Luciano, 
the production’s efforts to present 
Ibsen’s play in a contemporary set-
ting are remarkable. Rolf Fjelde’s 
translation of the Norwegian play, 
originally published in 1890, adheres 
to the contemporary and colloquial 
American language. Such a faithful 
translation, however, seems to come 
at the expense of obscuring the play’s 
salient themes and commentary on 
gender.

To compensate for the hazy plot, 
Kathryn Lieber’s scenic design drops 
major clues. The most intriguing 
(and distracting) prop on set, for 
example, is a tank filled with live 
goldfish, a tangible representation of 
the characters in their own myopic 
tank of life. Hedda, in fact, often 
stares off through the house’s large-
paned windows, as if domesticity and 
the expectations of womanhood are 
the walls of a tank entrapping her. 

Even in the play’s nuanced block-
ing we see the dialogue come to 
life. Judge Brack (Scott W. Patteson) 

maintains that Hedda can guiltlessly 
be involved with two men at once 
and boldly suggests that he, George 
and Hedda have a “triangle relation-
ship.” That motif then projects itself 
subtly onto the stage: Characters 
often appear on stage in groups of 
threes, spatially arranged in a triangle 
as they frantically exchange dialogue.  

In contrast to Hedda’s antics, the 
location of the play never changes — 
it always stays at the Tesmans’ home. 
Through such constancy, the set is 
able to ground a play that otherwise 
skims over the audience’s head with 
vague plotlines. Is Hedda pregnant? 
George and Aunt Julia certainly seem 
to think so, but Hedda’s in denial. 

Then there’s Hedda, whose role 
of being a good or bad girl is never 
made certain. She’s either a pitiless 
villain or heroic feminist who retains 
her maiden name in a show of girl 
power. She’s the embodiment of 
savoir faire on crack but a tragic hero 
in her own right. Though the ques-
tions are never directly answered, 
they are what maintain the pace of 
the play and tantalize us.

In the midst of the chaos she’s 
wreaked upon everyone else, Hedda 
self-righteously affirms to the audi-
ence, “There is beauty in all this.”  
The same could be said about the 
production itself—though the plot 
leaves us with inconclusive and loose 
ends, it’s certainly a beautiful charac-
ter piece that showcases the chops of 
its lead actress and does Ibsen justice.

REAPPLY FOR

UCSD’S Priority Deadline for filing the FAFSA is 

not give up all game long, and that run 
they passed there in the third quarter was 
awesome.”

At the beginning of the match, the 
teams traded goals, with LMU scoring 
first in the first minute of the game. The 
Tritons returned the favor with under 
three minutes to play in the quarter, but 
the Lions ran off three goals in the last 
two minutes to make the score 4-1 at the 
end of the quarter.

LMU also scored first in the second 
quarter, running off four unanswered 
points before the Tritons could mount 
any force.

“LMU is smart; they’re really pro-
ficient in every part of the game,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “If we give them any 
little crack, they’ll take advantage of it.”

Senior attacker Felicia Orozco scored 
a left-handed shot past the goalkeeper 
to end LMU’s scoring onslaught. Senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell also scored in 
the quarter, but the Lions still went into 
the half with a four-goal advantage. 

Coming out of the half, the Lions 

scored first in the third quarter to take 
their largest lead of the night. Orozco 
then scored her second goal of the 
matchup to bring it back to four, but 
shortly after, the Lions took a five-point 
lead again. 

Senior hole set Kirsten Bates was the 
first to ignite the Tritons’ initiative. She 
scored to make the score 9-5 with three 
minutes left in the quarter, and an LMU 
ejection led to Orozco’s third goal. Triton 
goalkeeper Kristen Oshtosh blocked a 
point blank shot, and a fast break goal 
by freshman hole set Melissa Bartow 
reduced the gap to 9-7. 

“We got off to a slow start and had to 
dig ourselves out of it a little bit today,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “I was really happy 
about how we bounced back in that third 
quarter.” 

After Oshtosh made two more great 
blocks, the Tritons were in position to 
bring it within one at the start of the 
fourth, but referees’ confusion gave the 
ball over to the Lions, who made it 10-7 
at the start of the fourth. The Tritons’ 
energy faded shortly after the misman-

aged finish, and their play suffered. 
“The confusion on our end of the pool 

after the whistle really hurt us in that sit-
uation,” Kreutzkamp said. “I thought that 
was a little unfortunate, but I thought 
we were still in a good position to have 
a chance to win the game at that point.” 

In the final quarter, the Lions scored 
three unanswered goals, and their goal-
keeper stopped strong shots from Crowell 
and Orozco to shut the Tritons down.

Orozco led the Tritons with three 
goals on the night, while Bartow scored 
twice. Ostosh tallied eight saves for the 
game.

The loss is the first for the Tritons in 
conference play, and stand at 3-1 in con-
ference play and 6-5 overall.

The Tritons next play at the UC Irvine 
invitational tournament Feb. 26-27 and 
will face off against USC in their first 
match. The Tritons return home Friday, 
March 11, when they square off against 
Cal State Bakersfield at Canyonview Pool.

The Tritons won the first game 
9-0 via the mercy rule, and took 
the last game by a score of 6-1. The 
Otters won the second game of the 
day 5-3. 

In the first game, the Triton 
offense took advantage of four 
Monterey Bay errors, as UCSD 
scored seven unearned runs. 
CSUMB third baseman Brittany 
Romero had a nightmare game with 
three errors, including two in the 
third inning. 

The Tritons scored four runs 
in the inning despite only getting 
one hit, a leadoff single by Caitlin 
Brown. UCSD added five more runs 
in the top of the fifth — with two 

RBI from Katrin Gabriel and one 
from Jennifer De Fazio. The Otters 
were unable to get anything across 
in the bottom half of the inning, and 
the game ended early.

Mya Romero, Gabriel and De 
Fazio each had two RBI. Camille 
Gaito (7-0) allowed four hits and 
struck out six batters to get the vic-
tory.

In the second game, UCSD 
struck first but was unable to hold 
onto the lead. De Fazio hit a lead-
off single in the top of the second 
inning, and Sara Woofter moved her 
to third on a sacrifice bunt. Jennifer 
Manuel’s sacrifice fly gave UCSD 
the lead.

The Otters came back with 

five runs in the bottom half of the 
inning, led by Jacki Serna’s three-
run home run off Tess Granath 
(4-2). UCSD put up two runs in the 
top of the seventh, but was unable to 
force extra innings. Gabriel stepped 
up to the plate with two out and two 
aboard, but popped out to third base 
to end the game.

In the last game of the day, Gaito 
again took the mound and pitched 
another solid game to get her sec-
ond win. The junior allowed six hits 
and one run, while again going the 
distance to pick up the victory. 

The win gives Gaito 37 in her 
career as a Triton, which ties her for 
fourth-most all-time.

Monterey Bay scored first, after 

an error by Gaito brought in a run 
in the second inning. But Romero 
hit a two-run double in the third 
inning to give the Tritons the lead. 
The Tritons then hit the Otters 
for four runs in the fourth inning, 
with RBI doubles from Romero 
and Esther Strom leading the way. 
Taylor Sepulveda also had a single 
that scored two runs.

Gaito was named CCAA Softball 
Pitcher of the Week and Romero 
was named CCAA Player of the 
Week for their efforts. Gaito pitched 
12 innings, allowing 10 hits and one 
run while picking up two victories. 
Gaito’s ERA of 0.30 is the lowest in 
the conference. 

Romero went 4-for-9 with three 

doubles and five RBI, and had a 
.500 on-base percentage in the three 
games.  

Kris Lesovsky became UCSD’s 
all-time leader in walks in the final 
game of the series.

After the series, the Tritons are 
11-2 overall and 6-1 in conference 
play.

The Tritons return to action on 
Wednesday with a doubleheader 
against University of San Diego. 
UCSD will then host Cal State San 
Bernardino with a doubleheader on 
Friday and Sunday, starting at 4 p.m. 
and noon, respectively.
