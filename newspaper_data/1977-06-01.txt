In the wake of the student ac-
tivism of the late sixties, the Third 
CoUege Conununications Program 
evolved from the demands and 
concerns for a curriculwn em-
phasizing present-day social 
problems and the effects of an 
information-based society. But 
since the initiation of the program 
in 1970, these ideals and 
aspirations have come to, what 
many individuals believe to be, a 
controversial standstill. 

Bureaucratic Standoff Stifles to make those appointments with the help and the concurrence of the chairman of the individual 
departments themselves." 

, 

Communication Program's Growth In addition, Saltman stated that no 1Jlore FTEs will be assigned 
specificaUy to the program until 
" such a time that communications 
becomes a department and that 
seems to be a long way off right 
now." 

This is the first in a two-part 
series on the Communications 
Program. The second part will 
appear Friday. 

Within the past seven years, the, 
number of declared majors in 

communications has increased 
from 30 to the current total of 316 
students. Compared with other 
academic majors, this total ranks 
fourth; following biology (1645), 
Psychology (504), and Chemistry 
(372) . 

In that time, however, the 
number of F:ull Time Equivalents 
(FTE) in the program has only 
increased to 3.5. This includes two 
full-time professors in the program 
and three Joint appointees from 
other departments who each give 
50 percent of their time to com-

munications. 
Unlike a department, com-

munications is a program based on 
an interdisciplinary curriculum. 
Besides courses listed as com-
munications, students fulfill the 
major by taking related courses 
from other departments such as 
visual arts, sociology, linguistics 
and literature. 

With a minimal number of 
communications professor-taught 
courses supplemented by courses 
from other departments, is there 
potential for the development of 
the program into a more focused 
discipline or an autonomous 
department? 

"Extremely Interdisciplinary" 
"Communications is almost by 

definition an extremely in-
terdisciplinary subject," said 
Herbert Schiller, Professor of 
Communications and chairman of 
the program. " The study of 
communications processes, in-
formation structures, changing 
roles of information in the society, 
the role of information, the whole 
function in the economy-these are 
the questions more and more 
people ask." 

But Schiller believes the current 
format of the communications

~ restrictions" on the acquisition of

Development Slated for La Jolla Vi lIage Area 
New 'Shopping Center Draws Controversy 

by Cindhl Hill and Paul Watry 
Staff Writers 

The May Co.-Donald Bren Corp., 
proposed builders of two shopping 
centers in the near proximity of 
UCSD, have met with opposition 
from various campus and local 
groups over their plans. 

Of primary controversy is the 
proposed La J olIa Specialty 
Center, to be located on Via La 
Jolla Drive off La Jolla Village 
Drive. 

This is the first in a two part 
eries. Friday's story will deal 

with UCSD reaction to tbe 
proposed sbopping center. 

The Specialty Center, which 
intends to house May Co., Bullocks-

Wilshire, and up to 50 other shops, 
has been tenned by some as "not 
conforming to the University 
Community Plan's intent to in-
corporate a community-oriented 
shopping center." 

The University Community 
Plan, drawn up in 1971 by the 
University Planning Group (a local 
advisory board) indicates a 
specific commercial design for the 
area in question. 

Permits for both shopping 
centers were approved March 15 
by the City Planning Commission, 
overriding the recommendation of 
the Planning Department that they 
be denied due to their non-
conformance with the University 
Community Plan. 

The Planning Commission's 
approval of the Specialty Center is 
currently under appeal to the City 
Council by Fred Scott Jr., a La 
Jolla merchant, with the backing 
of 69 other La Jolla businessmen 
and the endorsement of La Jollans 
Inc. (the citizens planning group 
for the area.) 

Oppositio~ Is Stated 
Basis for the appeal is that the 

Planning Commission implied that 
the La Jolla business community 
was unconcerned regarding the 
development, while in fact, the 
appeal reads, " ... the La JoUa Town 
Council, representing 422 Com-
mercial and Professional mem-
berships ... is on record ... stating 
their opposition to this develop-
ment." His personal reason is that 
he anticipates "an acceleration of 
the transition of the La Jolla 
conunercial district into a tourist 
oriented area" due to the at-

traction two regional shopping 
centers will have for the local 
shoppers. 

Legal aspects to be incorporated 
into the appeal by attorney Bruce 
Henderson, include,' "the 
University Community Plan 
clearly states it does not want 
regional shopping centers" and 
that " the Specialty Center does not 
confonn to the special zoning 
designated in the plan for 
commercial development with 45 
to 75 dwelling units per acre." 
Henderson said. In addition there 
are more than 25 standards to 
which a development must comply 
before a permit is issued upon 
which the Planning Commission is 
required to make specific findings 
of fact as to the compliance with 
each requirement. Included in 
these requirements are such items 
as an adequate variety of facilities 
to serve the community, and a 
minimum of 10 percent of each site 
to be landscaped. According to 
Henderson these specific findings 
of fact have not been made, 
"therefore the permit has been 
issued unlawfully" . 

However, Henderson 's 
allegation that the SpeCialty 
Center does not comply with the 
University Plan requirement for 
dwelling units was not sub-
stantiated by the Chairman of the 
University Planning Group, R.H. 
Hamstra. According to Hamstra, 
" the specialty Center does con-
form to the plan with regards to 
acreage and living space, but it 
does not conform to the concept 
caUed for in the Community plan." 

CooUnued 00 Pale' 

in terms of non-recognition of the 
kinds of pressures put on us as a 
new program in a college 
organized to try to do new things in 
new ways with new faces. 

"All kinds of existing standards 
and credentials made it impossible 
to be able to hire anybody who 
could satisfy the kinds of interests 
and demands coming from our 
student constituency as contrasted 
with those coming from the 
academic guardians of proper 
education," he added. 

On the other hand, Paul Saltman, 
Vice-chancellor of Academic 
Affairs, insisted that the in-
terdisciplinary format is adequate 
and that the program has been 
supported by "enonnous amounts 
of money and resources." 

He noted that the recently 
completed Media Center was built 
at a " very high cost per unit 
student , II and proposed FTEs in 
other departments were offered to 
teach in the program. (Saltman is 
referring to the practice of optimal 
resource utilization, whereby 
professors are hired in depart-
ments e.g. sociology or economics 
and are required to spend a portion 
of th ir teaching time in the 
Communications Program.) 

No Agreement On Hiring 
"But we could never seem to get 

any agreement about hiring people 
in disciplines such as economics, 
politica I science , sociology, 
psychology and anthropology," 
Saltman said, suggesting that 
SchiUer " did not try or was unable 

So the development of the 
program is caught in a Catch-22 
situation, whereby communication 
FTEs will not be hired until the 
program achieves departmental 
status and the program cannot 
become a department without a 
core of communication FTEs. 

Saltman suggested that the only 
way out of the dilemma is for 
faculty, initially hired in other 
departme ltS, to break off and 
come tog(·ther as the faculty core 
for a Communications Depart-
ment. Schiller, however, con-
tended that this type of faculty 
reorganization is highly unlikely 
because being hired into their 
original departments creates 
controls, and demands certain 
allegiances. 

Another solution could be the 
hiring of communication FTEs 
who would give a portion of their 
teaching duties to other depart-
ments . This would utilize the same 
number of FTE resources while 
aiding the growth of a com-
munications faculty core that 
would then have the potential and 
strength of achieving depart-
mental status. 

Individual "Can't Be Found" 
When thIs possible olution w 

posed to the Chancellor at a recent 
informal meeting on Third College 
affairs, McElroy said that a

Harri ngton: Little Hope of 
Ending Corporate Domination 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

"There is no debate on whether 
or not the future will be collec-
tivist, because it already is and is 
becoming more so," said noted 
socialist Michael Harrington. 

Harrington, a self-proclaimed 
Marxist by his own definition, 
spoke on " The American Dream : 
Dream or Reality?" at Mandeville 
Auditorium last Thursday evening. 

"We pride ourselves on being 
egalitarian," said Harrington, 
"but there has been no shift in the 
mal-distribution of wealth in the 
last generation." He criticized 
corporate control and was intent on 
the need to establish workers' 
rights, including health care and 
guaranteed jobs for aU capable 
person. 

According to Harrington, the 
current message from the federal 
government is that "the American 
system carmot survive without a 
reservoir of unemployed people, 
who are primarily black, brown, 
female and young." He felt that 
full employment is now defined as 
having a percentage of workers 
looking for jobs, adding that the 
unemployment rate has risen two 
percent since . the Kennedy ad-
ministration. 

"The American society has the 
most violent labor history of any 
advanced industrial society in the 
world," said Harrington. He poke 
of the unity of the European class 
struggle and of th heterogenityof 
the American workers, where it is 

difficult to develop a sense of the 
class as a whole. He felt that the 
lack of an active socialist 
movement has been substituted by 
" Americanism ," representing a 
country of classlessness where 
success has been based on ability 
instead of inheritance. 

Corporations Dominate 
Harrington condemned the 

situation of corporate control over 
the employment market, saying 
that " the government often yields 
to anti-social decisions" because of 
the power held by big business. He 
said that the corporation 
dominated investment process has 
yielded them a position of being 
" more equal than the rest of us." 
He warned that we, as a nation, 
have allowed market forces to

"Bla9nt" Sex Discrimination 
Outr ges UCSD Students 

. Dr. Hawta Friedman, assistant professor of biology, was denied 
tenure rece!lUy on the grounds that her reaearclJ work was "not up to the 
standards" eltpected of professors .chosen for tenure at UOiD. At a 
November, If16 meeting of the biolollY faculty, Friedman, and thref> 
male colleagues who had also been denied tenure, were granted, by 
general consensus of the faculty, a one-year extension of their UOiD 
contracts in order to permit them the opportunity of finding other jobs. 

On April 19, 1977, Dr. Warren BuUer, chairperson of the biology 
deparbnent, contacted Friedman privately and told her that .her enra 
year would not be granted because "there was no money available to 
keep her on the staff in any capacity." Two of the men who were granted 
the additional year under the same circumstances as Friedman are still 
going to be at UCSD next year, but Friedman has been given, in effect, 
two months notice to find another teaching job - an action unprecedented 
in the biology department! (The third fa~ member turned down his 
eztra year to take a position ·offered him some time ago. Vet, this new 
opening was not given to Friedman, either!) 

Why has Friedman been given only two months notice? Why did the 
chairperson of the biology department go against the general consensus 
of the faculty members and decide arbitrarily (and unnecessarily, since 
open positions are available) to deny Friedman her additional year while 
granting it to three men? The answer is simple: Friedman is a woman, 
and thus apparently does not deserve the same consideration and 
treatment as her male colleagues, in the eyes of BuUer. 

Every person COlUlected with UCSD should be outraged at this blatant 
act of discrimination. Show your concern by signing protest petitions 
located in Cluster Library, the Women's Center and circulating around 
campus.

whole life but in my latter years of 
high school I noticed a rapid drop 
in my hearing potential. I worked 
hard in high school so that I could 
enter UCSD the following Sep-
tember. 

My first impression of this 
university was that it would be a 
great place to get an education. I 
discovered that with every person I 
talked with that they have yet to 
hear of a deaf student at this 
campus. I knew then that I was 
going against insurmountable 
odds. 

I decided that I would try to get 
by with lip-reading, but the 
professors roamed around the 
room when they lectured so that it 
was difficult if not impossible to 
lip-read. 

To remedy this situation I hired 
notetakers . They were a great 
expense . Sometimes they would 
not turn up in class. Other times 
their notes were extremely in-
complete. I was at the edge of the 
cliff . 

The following quarter I set about 
on a different plan. nus was to ask 
the profs to give me the course by 
text. The first professor un-
derstood my problem and I had no 
difficulty. The next quarter I was 
to face the biology department. I 
received a direct rejection from all 
but one. No matter how much I 
pleaded they never gave in ... 

I retreated and sat in ~e fectures 
as a vegetable. I never listened to 
what they said simply because I 
couldn't. I tended to sneak notes by 
looking over other $tudents' 
shoulders and by guessing. Most of 
the time it was successful. But I 
never got the satisfaction from the 
courses that I needed. 

While there is the disabled 
students office ir the student office 
in the Sludent Center, it is mostly 
functional for those with physical 
defects. These include vision and 
mobility handicaps. Thousands of 
dollars are spent for them. I have 
yet to see some money spent on

can also teach courses jn. other 
departments such as economics, 
sociology or anthropology is a 
" unique individual" who cannot be 
found. 

Schiller claimed that "there are 
such people all around the 
universities in this and other 
countries," saying, "Almost 
everybody who is a senior person 
in the field of communications is 
someone who started out either 9S 
a psychologist, an economist, a 
political scientist, a sociologist, a 
linguist or an electrical engineer. 

"Those are the kinds of people 
who are at the high levels which we

become infinitely more powerful 
than we would allow our political 
leaders to be. 

Commenting on the present 
administration, Harrington said he 
felt that "Carter at his worst is 
better than Ford at his best, 
because he opens up the possibility 
for struggle, where Ford opened up 
only a possibility of despair." 
Although he questioned the ef-
fectiveness of Carter's actual 
efforts, Harrington sees the 
prospect of curbing big cor-
porations in. the current govern-
ment. 

Harrington terms the recently 
introduced Humphrey-Hawkins 
Bill as the "most timid, moderate 
law you can imagine." He said the 
Bill, which includes the right to a 
job for all persons, has seemingly 
become a radical demand and its 
formerly liberal supporters have 
become " nt(K!onservatives." But 
he emphasized that "full em-
ployment pays for itself," while 
unemployment is very expensive. 

" Let's take the rich off welfare!" 
demanded Harrington, noting that 
the 1977 budget included two tax 
deductions in capital gains for 
persons in the upper income 
bracket. He claimed that $30 billion 
is being given to the rich, while the 
money should be used to create a 
health.care system . 

Profit Over Wages 
Harrington also attacked the 

belief that "profits are not there to 
make the rich richer, but to 
provide corporations with the 
capital to serve your needs." He 
felt that the reluctance to raise 
wages is not to facilitate corporate 
spending, but to increase the profit 
margin for those who control big 
businesses. 

The need for a public energy 
plan, which will also provide jobs 
like that of the TelUlessee Valley 
Authority, was pushed for by 
Harrington. He saw a necessity for 
" local, c;ooperative solar energy" 
and humorously related his own 
belief that Exxon will ask the 
federal govenunent to provide risk 
capital to buy the Sun. 

"We should begin to abolish the 
rat race," Harrington concluded, 
saying that there is a fundamental 
decency in this society which 
should be built upon to overcome 
the " perversions of the American 
Dream."

would like to have in that core 
group," Schiller said, 

And Schiller insisted that the 
standstill boils down to the issue of 
hiring practices, saying "the 
question is a very good one and it 
really comes to the root of this 
whole business in terms of how you 
want to view it and why you don't 
want to view it one way rather than 
the other way. " 

By maintaining the present 
interdisciplinary philosophy of 
hiring and not considering 
potential appointments of com-
munications professors, Schiller 
asserted that " you're insuring that 
communications is never going to 
get any kind of real nucleus."

Bill Lowers 
Drinking Age 

SACRAMENTO--A bill that 
would amend the state constitution 
to lower the legal drinking age 
from 21 to 19 was approved last 
Thursday by the Assembly 
Judiciary Committee . 

The bill, sponsored by Assem-
blymember Louis Papan (0-
Millbrae) was sent to the full 
Assembly by a vote of eight to two. 
The bill needs a two-thirds

with additional loft areas to be 
available for sub·letting to 
students.

"Lace And Wiskey" 

Billion Dollar Baby Ain't Worth · 5 c 
by Ted Barke 
Stan "filer 

Not long after they started, Alice 
Cooper (and the same named 
band) admitted that he was only in 
it for the money. One could forget 
the hype which said that Cooper 
was the personification of an the 
worst things a kid's parents could 
imagine. The drag~ueen, S&M 
and violence roUtines were nothing 
but shticks employed to make a 
fonnerly obllclft rock band £run 
Detroit good press copy, and un-
derneath the mascara, leather 
whips and matted bair, Alice 
Cooper was really an AU American 
Boy engaged in an AU-American 
quest: the search for the big 
money. 

Under nOrmal instinctive 
prerogatives developed in the anti· 
hype miasma of the Sixties, one 
would have dismissed Cooper and 
crew as a bunch of rip-off OJ)' 
portunists, and would have fore~er 
banished their records to the 
garbage bin, but his Capitalist 
incentive admission had a reverse 
effect. Many of us who write about 
rock, pop and jazz compulsively 
had grown sick of the endless 
stream of holier than thou rock 
poetasters who operated under the 
mistaken notion that rock was the 
new medium for philosophy , 
poetry and other high art in-
dulgences and who tended to 
pontificate in pompous moral ton~ 
slightly less austere in intensity 
than the Pope's diatribes against 
" unnatural " birth control 
teclmiques. 

Cooper and crew considered 
their rock and roll, in spite of it's 
arty trappings, to be a business, 
which under the old free market 
theorems meant that as long as 
Cooper got paid the wages he 
demanded, he'd give his audience 
exactly what they wanted, ie, the 
highest quality rock and roll 
relayed at a level at once relevant 
to the sub-twenties psyche. For 
awhile, the unstated arrangement 
between artist and audience paid 
off . " 1'm Eighteen", "Under My

Out" and " Be My Lover" are 
brilliantly produced and per-
fOnned rockers that stand up 
against any the Stones or the Who 
have · done (both in terms of 
musical vitality and expressing the 
ephemeral confusions of being a 
teenager in a culture where per-
manent transitions, socially and 
morany, are the nonn,) and the 
band's famed showcase grossouts 
like "I Love the Dead", "Ballad of 
Dwight Frye" or "Halo of Flie~" , 
despite the admitted exploitative 
motivation gave a nauseatingly 
acute view of the fringe per-
sonality. All of which was bolstered 

considerable proceeds. No such 
luck, The Cooper band broke up, 
and Cooper himself, retaining the 
name, parlayed his reputation into 
a solo career. The last few albwns 
(Welcome to My Nightmare, Goes 
to Hell, and this new one Lace and 
Whiskey ) have been 
" professional" to the point of 
sterility. Using the best available 
studio talent (like Dick Wagner 
and Steve Hunter on guitars) and 
producer (Bob Ezrin), Cooper has 
fashioned a dull array of standard 
rock stylizations, from heavy 
metal to funk to good old rock and 
roll itself, all of which sOWlds as 
though it were culled from a text 
book and snapped together by rote. 
Lace and Whiskey is the sorriest 
example of Cooper's demise, and 
no other conunent other than it 
sucks is needed ,

At first, yes, Alice Cooper was a 
greedy capitalist pig as off-putting 
in his unguised greed ' as anyone 
you could name, but Cooper and 
crew maintained an integrity that 
many of our more " worthy artists " 
eDylan , the Airplane, Joan Baez) 
had lost. Plainly, Cooper supplied" 
the aesthetic requisite : he rock and 
rolled as though he were fighting 
for his life. That fact alone almost 
mitigates all other misgivings 
about the band, 

One would have thought, though, 
that once the Alice Cooper hype 
dissipated, the boys would have 
called it a day and retired on their 

The point of all this is that 
Cooper was a joke to begin with, a 

put~n made obvious that managed 
to justify itself for three years

brilliantly his sidemen flesh his 
product out, there's no escaping

If a survey were taken on 
campus to classify surfing as a 
team or individual sport, probably 
95 percent would say the latter 
category. 

Surfing is an art, a way of life, 
but not a team sport. Just after 
sunrise each morning of the week, 
the dedicated members of the cult 
make their daily solo pilgrim-
mages to Black's Beach to catch 
the waves at high tide. In the af-
ternoon, surfers are seen 
skateboarding aroWld campus clad 
in shorts and sandals, uttering a 
seemingly foreign languange with 
obscure words like "radical," 
"gnarley" and " tubed." By night, 
the surfer cruises around town 

lo~n program. 

looking for parties. 
And since uCSD deemphasizes 

intercollegiate sports, all the more 
reason to label it an individual 
sport. 

But just try to tell Coach Mike 
Shand and the 38 members of the 
Triton surfing team, who'll be 
strong favorites in next weekend's 
West Coast Intercollegiate Surfing 
Championships, i1's an individual 
sport. 

Eve of a Dynasty 
For the past three years, Shand, 

a transplanted New Yorker now 
working on his Ph.D. in linguistics, 
has been quietly assembling a 
school surfing power here in La 
Jolla. 

The six schools meet at Trestles 
Beach in San Clemente on 
June 4 and will hopefully bring 
back the West Coast title to UCSD. 
UCSB, who dethroned the Tritons 
in last year's championship by only 
one point, will try to defend their 
title lIgainst Golden West, 
Coastline, L.A. Harbor and Orange 
Coast Colleges, Cal State Long 
Beach and of course, UCSD. 

Tough to Score 
Trying to score a surfing meet is 

about as complex as protein 
synthesis. 

As explained by Shand, in a two-
way meet, each school puts three 
surfers into each heat. Those six 
then have 20 minutes to ride as 

as possible. Three

judges and one head judge, called 
the beach coordinator, give points 
on each ride depending on the 
length of the ride, where the surfer 
catches the wave and what he does 
on the wave. Just as in diving, the 
more difficult the maneuver on the 
board, the more points a surfer can 
accumulate . 

When the 20 minutes run out, the 
judges add up the points of the 
three best rides by each surfer 
from each judge's score sheet. The 
surfer with the highest total on 
each sheet is awarded six points, 
the second highest five points on 
down to one point for fifth place in 
a heat. 

These points are then added 
together, creating a maximum of 
18 points per surfer per meet. 
Team totals are computed by 
adding all their surfer's points 
together. 

Each surfer wears a different 
color jersey so the judges can tell 
"who's up. " With the varying 
conditions of the ocean and the 
range in number of waves a surfer 
can ride, the scoring becomes even 
more difficult. 

Underclassmen Excel 
Sophomore Rich Gleaves top; 

the Tritons, having totaled 82 
points, winning four of five meets 
he 's competed in. Eric Hanscom, a 
freshman from San Diego, has 73 
points and freshman Tom Rice 70. 
Even though he's compiled just 26 
points, Shand noted Bolton Colburn 
has " been surfing the hottest 
lately. " His 26 points are from only 
two meets, both won by Colburn. 

Competing in a league with 
UCSD, UCI, UCLA and USC, UCSD 
finished 3-1 (losing to Santa Bar-
bara ), 5-2 overall in 1977 (the other 
defeat coming at the hands of 
Golden West. Tho e two schools 
are the only ones ever to beat 
UCSD ). 

Coaching surfing, Shand ob-
serves is likened to gymnastics. At 
each "go-out" or practice at 
Black's, he watches and corrects 
each surfer, telling him to improve 
his ride by cutting back or 
executing a difficult move. 

Wait Until 1978 
Next season, each interschool 

contest will be filmed (just as in 
football) enabling the team 
members to improve by watching 
themselves surf. All 38 men and 
women on the squad will return, 
exce pt for senior Brian 
McDonough. 

Surfing will become a sanctioned 
NCAA sport this coming fall. 
UCSD's chances to win the national 
title are enhanced by having their 
school across the street from the 
Pacific Ocean, a natural drawing 
card for better surfers. 

Deaf Student .. 
Continued from Page 2 

encourage deaf students to come 
here, which I feel is very unfair. 

It is now the spring quarter of my 
junior year. The conditions have 
yet to improve much, if any at all. I 
do plan to graduate and I think that 
we should encourage other deaf 
students to enroll. 

I realize that while the UCSD 
faculty and the student body 
consider themselves intelligent, 
educated people , their 
"awareness" of deaf students is 
almost non-existent.
