UC's West to Tackle Everest in '·81 

UCSD Professor Jolin West and 15 other scienUlts and climbers 
will scale M&. Everes& in 1.1. 

By Doul Campion 
Science Editor 

Professor John B. West ofthe 
UCSD School of Medicine , 
along with about 15 other 
cientists and mountain 

climbers, will be scaling up the 
heights of Mt. Everest in the 
fall of 1981. According to West, 
a physiologist whose studies 
center on the lung, the goal of 
the expedition will be to learn 
about the effects of severe 
oxygen deprivation on the 
functioning of the human body. 

West divides the members of 
the expedition into three 
groups: the climbers, the 
scientist-climbers, and the 
scientists. He lists himself with 
"the scientists." 

"There'll be about eight 
climbers," he said, "They'll be 
chosen solely on their ability to 
climb high, and they will, of 
course, have extensive Hima-
layan climbing experience." 
Composing the second group 
will be four people West 

describes as having "some sort 
of scientific training." He said, 
"There are several such people 
- people who are scientists 
who are extremely good 
climbers." It is the members of 
these two groups who hope to 
reach the summit of Everest -
at 29,028 feet, the highest point 
on earth. 

West and the others in the 
third group will all have had 
experience on mountains, but 
will be on the expedition more 
for their medical research 
capabilities than for their 
climbing prowess. They will 
climb up to about 20,000 feet. 

West, himself, is not new to 
high altitudes . In 1961 he 
climbed toward the peaks of 
Mt. Makalau, also in the 
Himalayas, on an expedition 
led by Sir Edmund Hillary, who 
brought the first group of 
mountaineers to the summit of 
Everest. 

On the Makalau expedition, 
several tests were made, but 

the tests on Everest will be 
carried out at much higher 
altitudes. West explained, 
"There are "till a lot of 
unanswered questions. I mean, 
if we thought we could ex-
trapolate accurately (from the 
previous results), we wouldn't 
bother to go." 

The research planned on the 
upcoming excursion can be 
grouped into either of two 
categories. The "field tests" 
are those which involve data 
gathered from the climbers at 
the summit. According to West, 
"They include barometric 
pressure, because that' s never 
been measured at the summit 
and it's a very important 
variable; alveolar gas compo-
sition - that is, the composition 
of the air in the lungs - which 
we'll measure by trapping 
expired samples and bringing 
them back for analysis ; ECG 
(electrocardiogram - elec-
tronic monitoring of heart

United Way Fund Drive 
, Causes Staff Discontent 

By Teresa Tokar 
The United Way/CHAD 

campaign at UCSD began a 
new approach to fund raising 
this year. The "key contact" 
system, in which one person 
from each department was 
responsible for coJlecting 
funds , was replaced by a 
broader approach: entire 
offices and departments were 
shown United Way /CHAD 
presentations, and employees 
were given personal cards on 
which to pledge the amount of 
their donations. Some UCSD 
employee.s were pleased with 
the operations of the. cam-
paign drive this year, but 
others were agitated by some 
of the practices of the fund· 
raising drive. 

Last year, UCSD received 
$1,103,000 in research money, 
from the National CHAD · 
(Combined Health Agency 
Drive) organization. This 
money was concentrated in 
the Biology and Chemistry De-
partments, the Medical 
School and University Hos-
pital. During the same year, 
one in every tilree residents of 
San Diego County were in 

so~e way assisted by United 
Way/CHAD. Over 200 char-
itable programs assisted by 
United Way/CHAD are now 
active in San Diego County. 

Several of the UCSD staff 
employees interviewed asked 
not to be identiCied due to the 
nature of the story. 

Some employees felt that 
the solicitation for funds was 
too aggressive. On the back of 
each pled,e card was a 
"suggested guide" as to how 
much each person should 
donate in accordance to their 
annual income. For example, 
a person earnin, $7000 per 
ye~" was reque.ted to donate 
14' (.7 percent of their ,ross 

annual income) to United 
Way/CHAD. Those who earn 
$20,000 per year were asked to 
donate $400 (2 percent of their 
gross annual income). 

Said one university em-
ployee, "I don't believe that it 
should . be construed as an 
expectation. If you choose not 
to give, I don't feel that it 
should be anybody el e ' s 
business." Another employee 
added, " I ju t think that there 
was too much coercion . I 
objected to the fact that the 
cards were already filled out, 
assuming you would donate." 
A third employee, who sup-
ports her dependent child, 
said that she felt it was unfair 
to ask employees of limited 
income to contribute. 

Cynthia Leal , who helped 
with the CHAD campaign, 
said, "I don't think it was 
aggressive . I pressured 
nobody. I didn't stress that 
you had to give." 

Ray Ramseyer , UCSD 
Special Assistant to the 
Chancellor - Development, 
who coordinated the 1978 
campaign here, said, " This is 
a uggested guide to generous 
giving. It's not a nuisance 
drive. People are only being 
asked to give according to 
their ability." 

The university employees 
who did donate money were 
given special pins. These pins 
were not awarded to tho e 
who chose not to contribute. 
According to one employee, 
the pinless non-contributors 
felt stigmatized amongst their 
co-workers who received the 
pins. 

Other employees objected to 
the fact that the United Way/ 
CHAD presentations wer 
mandated. Some employees 
simply refused to attend the 
m s because of a bua 

work-load that day. In some 
departments, it was necessary 
for at least a few employees to 
stay behind to answer phones. 

According to one employee, 
at the presentation United 
Way/CHAD claimed to need 
greater amounts of money 
because of Proposition 13 
cutbacks in social service 
programs . However , this 
argument held little relevance 
for the UCSD employees who 
received no pay raises this year 
because of Proposition 13, the 
employee said. 

Ramseyer said, "If you don't 
want to give you can find many 
reasons for not giving. I believe 
that all these are excuses. Do 
you respond to human need, or 
don ' t you? Do you feel responsi-
bility for the community in 
which you live, or don ' t you? 
Are you going to be a parasite 
and let everyone else carry the 
load, or are you going to give 
your fair share? I feel its 
awfully important that people 
come to realize their steward-
ship responsibilities. Money is 
very close to everybody's 
heart, but some people have a 
harder time than others parting 
with it." 

Ramseyer described the act 
of wearing the pins as a 
"universal" act like wearing " I 
voted" pins. He added, " If you 
get some satisfaction out of 
(wearing the pins) God bless 
you." 

In response to what some 
emplotet!s felt was an overly 
aggres ive approach, Ram-
eyer saiJ, " You can't blame 

people for tryina. You aren't 
goi ~ t"". 
don't try. So far no one bas 
gotten a second card. We might 
find it necessary to send SUUle 
reminders. We have to work 
against human nature, and

On tbe baais of Flew's 
aaalyais, one would tbink that 
slavery did not exist in thi. 
country for over 200 years and 
that official segregation ended 
sometime around the tum of 
the century, instead of only a 
generation ago. The purpose of 
affirmative action programs is 
not, as Flew would have us 
believe, to correct ancient 
wron,s and the oppressions of 
the past. No one seriously 
helieves that the enrollment of 
Black students today in col-
leges and universities or the 
placement of Black workers in 
union apprenticeshipprogramS 
will erase the injustices and 
immorality of our ancestors. 
The purpose of these programs 
is to attempt to solve present 
social problems that have their 
origin in past neglect, but that 
remain a burden in the present 
and that will grow even larger 
unless now eradicated through 
decisive programs. 

In attemptiJII to maintain

of a free Dation depends, it ia 
frequently neceuary to adopt 
policies that are DOt in some

The United States, on the 
contrary, has endured the full, 
dismal consequences not only 
of slavery, but of official, state-
imposed racial segregation and 
discrimination lasting from the 
late nineteenth century until a 
decade ago. Not until 1954 did 
tbIJ nation's courts demand an 
end to this system in education 
and the public schools of the 
South made little progress 
towards integration until after 
1965, barely ten years ago. Until 
the late 1960s, moreover, Black 
Americans in substantial 
numbers were excluded from 
basic political participation in 
at least 13 states and denied the 
right to eat, sleep, and play in 
public accommodations and 
facilities open to other citizens.

and sociological results of this

Editor: 
Andy Schneider expressed a 

. personal commitment to child 
care which took the heat off the 
administrators he works with 
(he is acting head of parking). 
He wondered why adminis-
trators have been criticized for 
their performance, when a 
bundle of evidence has been 
presented showing adminis-
trative persecution of the 
Daycare Center (the attempted 
firing of its director being a 
recent example). Whether he 
intended it or not, Schneider 
relieved the administration of 

responsibility and put it on 
students, in such a way as to 
make a destructive response 
like Don Strebel's inevitable. 

As for Strebel, he bas a right 
to his own ideological views, 
but in his passion he distorts 
and misstates the facts of the 
Daycare situation. Such in-
accuracy can do much barm, 
given the careless reading 
habits most of us employ, and 
considering the mass of infor-
mation we're bombarded with.

been? Tbe search for funding 
haa been documented time and 
again in the campus press, for 
almost a decade. The Center 
has succeeded in obtaining 
CETA and State Dept. of 
Education fund •. Discontin-
uance of such sources as United 
Way and Cbancellor's Discre-
tionary Funds were Chancel-
lorial, not parental, decisions. 
(The latter funds went, instead, 
to intercollegiate sports.) 

Most significantly, in light of 
the onus Strebel tries to place 
on the parent's backs, Center 
supporters have, until two 
weeks ago, been prevented 
from raising Daycare funds in 
the community. This, too, was a 
Chancellorial deCision, de-
signed to prevent interference 
with fund ral.in, for Cancer

in the Center, was denied

women should sta~ at home till 
their kids reach 81e five -
unless they can afford child

Underlying Strebel's com-
plaints is a quarrel with Reg 
Fees themselves. Strebel wants 
taxpayers to provide "free 
education" but does not want to 
pay fees to support student 
services. 

Again, Strebel is entitled to 
his objections, but why not put 
them in context? Why single out 
Daycare? After all, student 
fees support student Financial 
Aid, and Daycare is just 1I form 
of Financial Aid . Why not 
attack the concept of student 
fees supporting other students? 
Why support intramurals or 
sports or bOy boats for the 
Aquatic Center? Shouldn't 
volleyball playen buy their 
own nets? And why attack 

-Daycare - which costs only 
about sixty-five cent. per 
student each quarter - when 
we julve by far the highest 
ratio of adminlltraton of any

Strike Shuts Down' Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - A 

general strike called by Mos-
lem religious leaders and 
politicians who want to topple 
the beleaguered shah of Iran 
virtually shut down this strife-
tom country yesterday, and 
new anti-shah violence erupted 
in the provinces. 

Official reports said troops 
shot and killed at least nine 
people and wounded 30 in the 
town of Gorgan, 185 miles 
northeast of here, when anti-
government demonstrators did 
not obey orders to disperse. 
Rioters reportedly tried to set 
fire to several buildings' and a 
bank, but were driven off by 
security forces . 

The official part news agency 
said a giant demonstration in 
the holy city of Mashhad, hear 
the Russian border 466 miles 
northeast of here, was kept 
under control by soldiers 
backed by armored vehicles. 

Thousands of demonstrators 
marched through the streets of 
Masshad to protest the shooting 
of seven people last week and 
the alleged maltreatment of a 
Moslem religious leader. 

The general strike, called to 
maintain pressure on Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and 
protest the actions of his troops 
in quelling riots, was backed by 
the opposition National Front, 
whose leader. Karim Sanjabi.

Teng . One report said the 
shakeup may be announced 
today. 

The Japanese news service 
Kyodo, in a dispatch from the 
Chinese capital, said 4 ,000 Teng 
backers rallied in two Peking 
squares Saturday night and 
Sunday demanding that Hua , 
Mao Tse-tung's handpicked 
successor as Communist Party 
chairman, be removed from his 
second post , premier , and 
replaced by Teng. 

It said a new wall poster went 
up in Peking denouncing the 
1965.£9 Cultural Revolution as a 
national disaster. The "revo-
lution" a purging of reac-
tionary elements in favor of 
ideological purity; was spon-
sored by the late Mao. 

Kyodo said Teng told Japa-
nese Democratic Socialist 
Pa rty leader Ryosaku Sasaki at 
a meeting in Peking that the 
Chinese leadership was con-
sidering revising two decisions 
its Politburo made in April 1976 
- one that promoted Hua to 
first vice chairman of the party 
and premier, and another that 
dismissed Teng from all his 
party a nd government posts. 

Upon Mao's death in Septem-
ber 1976, Hua was elevated to 
chairman, and Teng later was 
reinstated in the hierarchy. 

It remained unclear whether 
Hua might be removed from 
the party chairmanship as well, 
since his promotion to that post 
stemmed from his appointment 
as .first vice chairman. 

Teng indi cated the " re-
visions" would be made be-
cause Mao was ill at the time 
and the decisions were initiated 
by the radical "Gang of Four, " 
the now-disgraced group led by 
Mao's wife , Chiang Ching. 

The two decisions were made 
after rioting in Peking's Tien 
An Men Square on AprilS, 1976, 
when anti-Teng groups tried to 
remove wreaths placed there in 
memory of the late Premier 
Chou En-lai, Teng's mentor. 
Teng was blamed for the riot 
and deprived of his posts. 

Since his" rehabilitation " 
last year. China analysts have 
questioned how long the strong· 
willed Teng would work in 
tandem - and officially in a 
subordinate role - to the little-
known Hua, who at the time 
was believed to have been a 
compromise choice for 
premier, the official in charge 
of the government. 

Kyodo . in a Hong Kong 
dispatch, quoted an informed 
source there as saying the 
Communist Party Central 
Committee would make an 
important announcement to-
day . The source r~portedly 
indicated it might deal with a 
reshuffling of the premier's 
post. 

The agency also quoted Teng 
as telling Sasaki that the 
current public campaign to 
reassess the actions of the late 
Chairman Mao has been con-
ducted with official approval.

Third to Revise GE Requirements 
(CoadllIL from pqe 1) 
Aceordlnll to Walloll. Third 
ItUdenti aut year expreued 
diaatiafaction with the present 
requireJnent. citiDJ" alarm-
in," problem. In writln, 
abiUtiea and lUIIeatiq that 
they needed an additional 
course in compo.iUon to 
improve their writin, skill •. 
WatloD hid that the .tudents· 
concerns were re,arded seri-
OU8ly by the Review Commit-
tee. 

Several options in a composi-
tion requirement change were 
discussed la.t spring by the 
committee and were further 
evaluated by the Third College 
CO\lncil this year. according to 
Watson. The committee agreed 
that oral expression should be 
more strongly emphasized in 
Thfrd's composition program. 
but they diUered in their 

approach to combine it with the 
wrttiDJ Pf'OIJ'am. 

ODe lUgation made by the 
committee wu to implement 
two quarters of written and oral 
expreilion In which both 
wrltlq and orallkill. would be 
equally empha.lzed. 

Another option dllCUSSed was 
to require of student. two 
quarters of wrltin, In which 
oral expression would be 
inte,rally combined but not 
placed on an equal basis with 

, writing. Proposed by Professor 
Charles Cooper. the incoming 
Director of the Composition· 
Program at Third. the option 
hal receive(' strong support 
from Third faculty . 

A third alternative to the 
present composition require-
ments . as proposed by the 
committee. would he to exclude 
oral expression fr"m the two 

quarters of writln, but to 
emphasize It leparately In 
another course. 

Several weeks a,o Watson 
distributed a "reference ballot 
among the faculty at Third. The 
ballot listed the three ap-
proaches to Inte,r~tilli oral 
expression Into the compo.ltlon 
requirement. The faculty 
displayed an overwhelming 
support of the second option In 
which oral expression would be 
integrated within the compo-
sition pro,ram but would not be 
equally emphasized with 
writing skills. Twenty-seven of 
the 34 faculty members voted 
for this option. 

Before any permanent 
changes in Third ' s GE re-
quirements can occur. Watson 
said. the Academic Senate (AS) 
must approve the recommen-
dations. W atson h~pes that they 

will vote on tbe proposals 
durlD, winter quarter. 

Watson noted that the 
faculty's IUpport of the "Coop-
er Proposal." al it has been 
named. ia oDly an Indication of 
their preferencel. In order to 
submit a f10al proposal to AS. 

th~ Council must first approve 
the recommendations and 
another. "official. " faculty 
vote must be taken. 

W allon has asked the Council 
permission to submit an official 
ballot to the faculty. based upon 
the recent preference ballot. 
before the Council's next 
meeting this Friday. Watson 
said he made the request "so 
that the ballot can be voted on 
before the end of the quarter." 
He added that in " this way they 
could avoid taking a vote 
during finals week . " 

Janet Lynn . Third ' s aca-

demic counselor. said she was 
"confident that the student 
response will be positive " 
toward the new composition 
requirements if they are 
approved. She said that Third 
students "actually originated 
the idea" by complainin, that 
"they weren't ,etting enough 
writing skills." 

Watson said that if the GE 
requirement chan,e! are 
approved. next vear's fresh-
man class m~y not be bound bv 
them. "Next year will be a 
transition period." he said . 
" Many new students. having 
relied upon this year's cata-
logue. will not be aware of the 
requirement changes." Wat-
son said t~at they will be given 
a choice of the present set of G E 
requirements of the new . 
altered version.

Triton Tourney Comeback Falls Short 
By S&aa H .... 

Chapmu College held off a 
late UCSD raDy to win the 1171 
UCSD Invitational BuketbaD 
Toumameat, 7...... The four 
team tournament took place 
Friday and Saturday In the 
MaiD Gym aDd produced some 
close, excltiDl,amea. 

The coDBOlation match wu 
taken by Fresoo State. 71-73. 
over Pomoria Pitzer m a see-
saw battie. Both teams owned 
the lead at various times in the 
contest, with Fresno finally 
prevailing in the closiD, 
minutel. 

But the main event Saturday 
night presented the most 
thrillin"ame of the weekend. 
Chapman controlled three-
fourths of the match. at one 
point leading the Tritons by 17 
points . After a sluggish 10 
minutes of the second half in 
which both teama scored only 
10 points apiece. the action 
picked up. 

UCSD be,an pressin, on 
defense while opening up on 
offense and for a while looked 
like a team trailing by a basket 
rather thaD 13 points. With five 
minutes remaining in the game 
the Panthers still lead by 
twelve, but the Tritons began to 
threaten after a time out and a 
conference with coach Barry 
CllIIDin,ham. 

In the ensulOl three minutea 
UCSD pulled within seven 
point • . on the strengths of 
Lebrnan Brockett and Scott 

Knudlen. Each basket was 
foUowed by cheers from the 
respective benches aDd the wild 
crowd. Cbapman was able to 
bold on to Ita five point lead 
until, wltb less than fifty 
seconds remamiDI. Howard 
Grunlob 18Dk two free throws to 
clGle the ,ap to 3. 

However. the Tritons full 
court press did not payoff as 
Steve Nichols took a lon, 
Chapman pus ud dunked with 
leu than thirty seconds to go. 
UCSD anawered with a quick 
basket but Don Healy slipped 
past the defensive press to 
score for the Panthers at the 
buzzer. 

The game was marred by a 
high number of turnovers 
adding to the disorganized play 
of UCSD. Errors and lack of 
offensive control by the Tritons 
allowed Chapman to jump to a 
quick lead, which grew 
throughout the first half. After 
being down by 17 points. UCSD 
managed to score 11 straight to 
narrow the difference, 27-21. 
The Panthers then regrouped to 
close out the hair. leading. 44-
31. 

Consolatioa Game 
In the consolation game. 

Fresno Pacific and Pomona 
traded the lead in a li,ht 
contest that was not decided 
until the final seconds. Fresno 
took an early lead at the start of 
the game, but Pomona p'ulled 
within two at the half. 

Both teams played dead even 

, 

ID the second half until midway 
in the period when Pomona tied 
the match. then lead by six 
points with seven minutes 
remaining . A minute later 
Fresno tied the game where it 
stayed UDtil Herb Mooney hit 
one free throw to put Pomona 
ahead. 

Fresno scored a goal with 
just over one minute left aDd 
Gary Fast added two foul shots 
to put them out of reach. A 
juplper by Curtis Foster of 
Pomona missed the mark and 
the Sage hens went down in 
defeat. 

In earlier preliminary con-
tests Chapman whipped Fresno 
7.-61. and UCSD outlasted 
Pomona. 76-60. The firat game 
of the tournament saw the 
Panthers and Fresno play a 
close but sloppy first half in 
which neither team appeared to 
want the game. Chapman 
finally pulled away in the 
second period and never looked 
back. 

UCSD took control of its first 
game agaiDst Pomona and 
appeared ready to demolish the 
Sagehens. The Tritons. once 
abead by thirteen points saw 
their lead dwindle to three in 
the second half. Two con-
secutive baskets by Tom 
Omalev. the second off a steal. 
gave UCSD some breathing 
room. During the next 2: 11 the 
Tritons outscored Pomona 1:H 
to assume a sixteen point 
margin. 

The TrUont took second place in the UCSD Invitational Basketball 
Tournament held last weekend. ....,. ~ St •• H ..... 

Women Face Lean Season 
By Karea HUDler 

S,......Edi&or 
Once again mother UCSD 

intercolleliate athletics coach 
has termed the 1971-79 season a 
" building year." Coach Judy 
Malone's women's basketball 
team. with Its 7 freshmen and 5 
upper classmen, reflects the 
youth of many UCSD squads. 

"Our team is mainly com-
posed of freshmen." explained 
Malone. "They have to learn 
that colle,e basketball is 
different from hi,l) school. This 
will take some tim~. Next year. 
thougb, we'lI do well. 

This year' I women's basket-
ball squad will revolve around 
the leadership of veteran Carol 
Hawley and freshmen Jill 
Keene. 

. 'Carol is our most skilled 
player. She Is an excellent 
defensive pard with a fan-
tastic outside shot," Malone 
remarked. Hawley. as'." 
guard has played under Malone 
for three years. 

At 5· ... tall Jill Keene is an 
"excelieDt player. " com-
mended Malone. "She has a 
good hook abot." 

Malone cited S'U" junior. 
Dui Grady. as a probable 
starter at ceoter. "Dani really 
undentandl basketball well." 
Lisa Yonemoto. a third year

Participation in a league will 

enable the team to play in an 
end-of-the-year championship. 
which they were unable to do in 
the past. One of Malone's goals 
for the team is to get to the 
regionals. ' 

Area teams should give the 
Triton cagera " no problem." 
according to Malone's predic-
tions. Pt. Loma. USIU, and 
USD are among the local teams 
scheduled. 

Coach Malone is especially 
pleased with the new heiJ(ht on 

this year's squad. " We were at 
a definite disadvantage last 
year. " she remarked. " Our

Laurie Scott (S'U" ) and Mary

provide the much needed 
addition with their extra inches

Malone is looking for a good

By HeIII') ,DeV .... 

S&d' WrlleI' 
When the Women's volley-

ball season btlpn, .some folks 
were pessimistic, 

Hollywood scriptwriters and 
producers were invited down to 
UCSD to pick up some new 
ideas for disaster filma. All 
royalties were to go to the 
survivors and the next of kin. 
Squad members were en-
couraged to purchase life 
insurance before word leaked 
out. Legal Aid provided free 
attorneys to help prepare last 
wills and testaments. The Red 

Cross was put on standby alert. 
In a word, the season's outlook 
was bleak. 

The season began on Septem-
ber 30 with UCSD belDl the 
perfect All-Cal tournament 
hosts. Tbey lost all ten of their 
matcbes. In tbree days the 
team would begin its two 
month, 20 matcb season. 

The odds seemed better at the 
Alamo. Tbe Las Vegas book-
makers would have taken this 
team off the boards. If it were a 
prizefight, they would have 

· thrown in the towel before the 
opening bell rang. Had it been a 

borserace, the SPCA would 
have stepped in to stop it. 
People see enough violence on 
television, they don't want to 
witness senaeleaa slaughter in 
their own gymnasium. 

Volleyball is a game domi-
nated by tbe tall and powerful 
spikers. What the Tritons 
lacked in power, they made up 
in shortness. One opposing 
coacb observed that if the team 
were placed end to end they 
might reach the net. No one on 
the team was over,s'S", and the 
squad lost their only real threat 
at spiker due to a severe muscle 
pull. Awe inspiring they were

"Bully" . for James Whitmore 
By Aliso. Hall 

Those wbo have deligbted In 
actor James Whitmore's past 
characterizations of American 
folk heroes, notably Will 
Rogers and Harry Truman, will 
find sufficient pleasure in his 
portrayal of yet another his-
torical personale, President 
Teddy Roosevelt, in the new 
film Bully. Those same fol-
lowers of Whitmore's work will 
bave to overlook certain faults 
- poor camera work and 
mediocre screenplay, for 
example - to centinue in their 
admiration, however. Whit-
more alone, with his brimming 
enthusiasm, is the sole reason 
to botber with BuOy. But even 
the otherwise engallng history 
of Roosevelt, surely one of the 
more colorful presidents we've 
had, Isn't enough to sustain this 
film from beginning to end. 

Bully would have been more 
enjoyable had it been edited. 
Over two hours of anyone is less 
than fascinating; this holds 
true for the gregarious Roose-
velt played by Whitmore. The 
first section, "The Adventures 
of Theodore Roosevelt, " clock-
ing in at an hour and a half, 
could almost have stood alone 
from a theatrical viewpoint. 
The characterization of TR, on 
which the filmed play is based, 
is complete and stimulating. 
With meager revisions, this 
could have sufficed. Producer 
Sam Maturo, however, presses 
on (or a forceful finish. From a 
historical perspective, the 
second half , "The Further 

Adventures ..... including TR's 
remamale, failure to win his 
third term with the Progressive 
Party and loss of a son in WWI 
Is thoroulb, but the two parts

Restaurant Review 

shorter, more cohesive work. 
The final product, though of 
biol.raphical accuracy, is 
painful in its lenlth. 

Had the screen version been 
aPll)reclalblv different frbm the 

actual play, perhaps some of 
the slow moving passages 
would have been revised . 
Through a series of digressions, 
writer Jerome Alden recreates 
TR with the same appeal as an 
old man's war stories. Alden 
seemed to have no other focus 
than to reveal TR's vitality, his 
emphatic interests in con-
servation and defense. Several 
relieving glimpses are seen of a 
subdued, introspective Roose-
velt (during his election loss in 
1912 and remembrances of his 
first wife, Alice), but most of 
the monologue is in the 
pounding, intensive style ofTR. 

The film perform ance is 
marred in technical areas as 
well. One has the impression 
that one is watching a ' pro-
duction of the play , rather than 
a staging particularly for the 
film. Part of this is due to the 
jumpy splicing of several 

performances and in the 
simplistic execution of Jlghting 
and camera technique. One 
major spotlight used at the 
Ahmanson (where the motion 
picture was shot) illuminates 
Whitmore at center stage, with 
dimming employed on the 
backstage/office site. Several 
close-ups revealed a bright 
glare off of Whitmore 's face, 
doing little to accentuate his 
features . Co-producer Mel 
Marshall said that five camera 
angles and a sixteen track 
Dolby sound system were used 
to make the film . Neither is 
evident, however. 

Whitmore is a brilliant actor 
and Theodore Roosevelt a 
worthy subject for portrayal. 
Unfortunately , the static , 
unimaginative translation of 
Bully from stage to screen fails 
to live up to its potential.

"Cheese Adventure" Good Trip 
of several strata of turn-of-the-
century British society, bour-
geois, country gentlemen , 
ladies and clergy , in the context 
of a rather droll comedy plot. 

By Judy Walton 
'" Barry Alfonso 

Cheese by any other name 
would smell ... the same. This 
reflects the attitudes of many 
who are rather vague in their 
opinions about cheese. After 
all, it seems strange to as-
sociate this dairy product with 
excitement, challenge, or a 
novel experience. 

Being of this school of 
thought, we were a bit skeptical 
about our first visit to Tbe 
Cheese Adventure , a res-
taurant/market on La Jolla 
Blvd. We wondered what type 
of adventures we would have in 
a place full o( cheese - big 
cheeses, small cheeses, old 
cheeses, young cheeses, even 
cheeses with jalapeno pepper in 
them. 

We soon found out, in what 
developed into an engrossing, 
surprising, yes, even en-
thralling journey into the 
international world of this 
delectable, versatile food . 

We sat down atone oCthe nine 
indoor tables and were 
presented with menus offering 
an astoundinl variety: There 
were cheeses flavored with 
garlic, caraway seeds, peaches 
and pineapple, various ched-
dars and Emmentahlers, 
delicate cream cheeses and 
robust mozzarellas. We were ' 
overwhelmed by gastronomi-
cal fantasies. We needed a 
,uide, and sbe appeared in the 
persor) of Gerlinde Topzand, co-
owner of The CItene Adventure 
(with ber husband Jon). Top-
zand prepared for us a fabulous 
selection of the open-faced 
cheese sandwiches which are 

the specialty of the restaurant. 
The prices were reasonable and 
the food was delicious. Topzand 
sat down with us as we sampled 
the sandwiches - all heated 
and topped with cheese and 
fruits . 'It was certainly an 
adventure for the appreciative 
palate; mouth-watering crea-
tions stared up at us from the 
plates - Gourmandise cbeese 
with real cherries on top of a 
heated slice of cinnamon 
bread; peaches and imported 
Danish Peach cream cheese on 
cinnamon bread; even apples 
and cheddar cheese on raIsin 
bread. 

"We wanted to use cheese in a 
simple way. I'm not into 
complicated cookin~," said 

Topzand. She admitted that this 
type of restaurant was fairly 
unusual on the West Coast, 
although New York has plenty. 
"That (New York) is where all 
the cheeses come into the 
country," said Topzand. 

Barry got interested in the 
jalapeno cheese sandwich, and 
it disappeared rapidly from 
view. "What's the most exotic 
tasting cheese you !lave here?" 
he asked, starting on the apple 
cheddar sandwich with gusto. 

"Oh,l'd say it would be either 
the real Roquefort imported 
from France, or the English 
Stilton," replied Topzand .

and Holland, where my hus-

Call Theatre for Show Times 

By John Nadj 
Due to a broken water main 

and a comedian who sounded 
like a broken record. the Peter 
Gabriel concert was held up for 
almost an hour and a half last 
Sunday. 

The comedian who preceded 
Gabriel. Dick Shaw. turned out 
to be one of the worst acts I have 
seen in my life. Speaking at 
length about all sorts of drug 
induced psychoses, the man 
bored the audience out of its 
collective mind. 

The comedian . no doubt 
sensing the hostility , reo 
Iinquished the microphone as 
everyone waited breathlessly 
for the arrival of Mr. Gabriel. 
When Gabriel walked on stage 
and sat down by his piano. the 
crowd didn't recognize himat 
first. but it didn 't take long 
before the audience went wild 
shrieking all sorts of frenzied 
things: After a short chat with 
the audience Gabriel intro. 
duced his band. The band made 
its way to the stage via the 
ais les carrying hand-held 
spotlights which they would 
sweep over everyone until at 
last they were all on stage. 

Closer inspection revealed 
the band to be costumed in 
Caltrans safety vests and hard 
hats. which they later shed with 
the exception of Gabriel. who 
wore a Caltrans vest with 
orange gloves. The effect was 
somewhat Frankensteinian 
and the light show o~ly in· 
tensified the effect. The stage 
was lit 'by an impressive 
assortment of colored lights 
ranging from blue and red to 
green and yellow to orange and 
purple. The garish lighting 
combined with the costumes 
and music produced an unique 
audio-visual effect. 

Once under way. the concert 
proved to be one of the most 
original. off·the·wall shows I 
have ever seen. Gabriel started 
the evening with " On The Air" 
followed by such other notable 
tunes as " D.LY .... " Indigo." 
"Perspective." "Moribund the 
Burgomaster , " "Solsbury 
Hill," " Humdrum ." with 
special renditions of "White 
Shadow" and " Modern Love" 
above and beyond the call of 
duty. 

While performing "Waiting 
for the Big One" he forsook the ' 

stage and headed for the 
upstairs balconies . from 
whence he wound his way down 
to the lower level back to the 
stage. This enabled the au· 
dience to see their hero up 
close, something rarely pos. 
sible nowadays. Gabriel also 
managed to sneak in some 
hitherto unheard music. 

Peter Gabriel and the band 
were called bac k for no less 
than two encores during which 
they Performed "Here Comes 
the Flood" and Gabriel's own 
brainchild " The Lamb Lies 
Down on Broadway," which 
soothed me; I knew then that 
Rael lives on . Performed with 
leather jacket and the works 
" The Lamb Lies Down on 
Broadway" proved once again 
that the Gabriel of yesteryear is 
alive and kicking, although a 
little more predictable now. 

On a scale of 1 to 10 it is my 
opinion that Gabriel gets a firm 
9. For those of you who missed 
this once·in·a-lifetime chance 
to see a performer of such 
magnitude in a small theatre I 
such as the California. all I can 
say is " You should have seen 
what you missed. "

" What sort of crowd does a 
place like this attract? " Judy 
asked. thinking of elegant 
French diners or choosy cheese 
connoisseurs . The waiter . 
overhearing this question as he 
served a "special dessert" 
(baked apples and. believe it or 
not, caramel-tasting cheese) 
answered. " I'd say we mostly 
get a lot of older people, or 
younger students. We don't get 
too many middle·aged people 
or families ." Topzand men. 
tioned thllt she was surprised 
by the number of vegct:lrians 
that come in . but added that she 
never realized people on the 
west coast were so interested in 
health roods a nd good diets .

The Cheese Adventure offers 
over 100 wines as well as cheese 
and fruit. Customers may 
select the wine of their Choice 
and bring it to their table 
directly from the display shelf. 
The selection of cheeses offers 
something to please everyone 
- goat and sheep cheese are 
included on the impressive list. 
not to mention several different 
" processed cheeses." Topzand 
explained that most of the 
cheese Was raw (cultured from 
certain " friendly" bacteria) 
and uncut (left on the " mother" 
cheese wheel until served) . 
"The processed cheese is 
cooked cheese. that has been 
chemi ca lly flavored ." s he 
explained.

special " health cheese" from

the history behind cheeses. 
Understandably, most of the 
peole who work here get really 
enthused about cheeses. " 

Topzand enthusiastically 
informed us that, " We do

Everest· 
(Continued from page 3) 

The government of Nepal 
only grants permission to two 
teams of climbers to go up the 
mountain each year. of which. 
one begins its ascent in the 
spring. and the other in the fall . 
The schedule is currently 
booked all the way up to 1986. 
West considers his team for· 
tunate to have obtained permis· 
sion to carry out its plans . " I 
think. possibly, we would have 
preferred the spring slot. but 
we were not able to get that." he 
said. 

Some Object to UW/CHAD 
The major difficulty still 

remaining in the planning of the 
Everest trip is the funding. 
West just recently submitted an 
application to the National 
Institutes of Health for a grant 
of about $170,000. If approved. 
the money supplied would be 
used to cover the designing and 
purchasing or equipment. In 
addition to that. though, the 
physiologist estimates that 
another $400.000 will be re-
quired.

Greenberg is optimistic for 
next season. The squad was 
relatively young and the coach 

. is looking to build upon the solid 
" core" sbe developed this year. 
If she can recruit some much 
needed offensive punch to 
complement the already solid 
defense, Greenberg feels that

Deep down they know that they 
ought to give and they have to 
justify their actions. If the 
system were entirely different 
they'd find some other excuse 
for not ,iving, that's all." 

About the employees who 
received no pay raises this 
year, Ramseyer said. "A fairly 
good share of (the employees) 
have received merit in· 
creases." He feels that the ideal 
attitude about· Proposition 13 
should be: "I'm a lot better off 
than the person who lost their 
jobs. tberefore I ought to give." 

Even though the' campaign 
was designed to reach all 
university employees. ac· 
cording to Publicity Chairman 
Chuck Colgin, employees in the 
Bookstore. the Police Station. 
and the Third College Lunch 
Box claimed to know nothing 
about the United Way/CHAD, 
campaign here. 

Ramseyer seemed generally 
pleased with the amount of 
money contributed in the 
campaign here . He said . 
., We've got some very generous 
people. There are people within 
every group who are just 
tremendously generous." 

The goal for the UCSD 
campaign this year was 
$110.241. a 14 percent increase 
oyer last year's donations of 
$96,327. 

" We' re going out to private 
organizations and to corpor· 
ations and so on," he said, and 
added, smiling. " We' re very 
much in the market for anyone 
who'd like to give a donation-
