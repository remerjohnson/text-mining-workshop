UCSD Wants 
Assistant AlAe 
Coordinator 

By MOliry ht Huxley 

" Two jobs in one-that's the prospect 
for the new Assistant Coordinator for 
Affi rmative Action ." stated Tom Hull, 
Assis tant Vice-Chancellor of Academic 
Affai rs in a recent interview. 

On one hand, there's the ad-
ministrative analyst and lawyer who is 
well-acquainted with the laws and 
regu lations related to the national af-
firma tive action movement and who is 
abl to record and analyze inequities in 
salar ies and promotion opportunities. On 
the other hand, the job focuses on 
human relations, particularly with regard 
to women's and minority groups.

Black's 'Beach Stands Alone 
The San Diego City Council , in a reconsideration last we k of the 

nudity-in-public issue, aaproved an ' ordinance outlawing publiC 
nakedne~s everywhere except on the 900-foot section of Black's 
Beach . 

A resolution two weeks ago made swimsuits optional at Black' , 
but public reaction to that ruling caused Councilmen Gil Johnson, 
Lee Hubbard and lim Ellis to call for the nudity Issue to be r in-
troduced to the board . 

The n w ordinance, opposed by Ellis and Hubbard after Johnson 
changed hi mind, sp ctfically prohibit nudity out Ide of Black's

The Tuskegge experiment . 
is a prime example of white, 
educated clinica l resear-
chers exploiting, non-white 
undereducated subjects for 
the benefit of middle-class 
Americans, a leading doctor 
of community medicine 
said Wednesday night at 
t he UCSD School of 
MediCine: 

Dr . Count D . Gibson, Jr. 
chairman of the Depart-
ment of Fami ly, community 
and Preventitive Medicine 
at Stanford Univ rsity ' s 
School Of M dicine, urged 
do tors to "come down off 
their paternalistl 
pede tals ." By working with 
informed onsum r , 
clinical re archers would 
avoid such inappropriate 
mean 6f investigation, (as 
the Tu keg study,) h 
tated . 

Gibson used the Unit d 
Stat s PubliC Health Servi e 
study in 1932 of an initial 
group of 250 poor, black, 
male farmers infected with 
syphilis as a pringboard for 
his remedies for problems 
besetting medical research 
today. 

" Inhabitants of Macon 
County, Alabama (Tuskegee 
is an unfortunate 
misnomer , Gibson said) 
were chosen for the tudy 
because the researchers 
knew they were too poor 
and ignorant to seek 
treatment for yphilis, and

arsenic and bismuth was 
known at that time . Not 
even after the advent of 
penicillin for syphilitiC 
medication in 1950 were 
the victims treated , Gibson 
added . 

It was not until the ex-
periment came to publiC 
attention in 1972 that a

mission ended the 40 year-

A Cruel I nItl8tlon 
I went to a meeting of the Triton Wargaming Society 

the other night on the eleventh floor of Tioga Hall, and I 
must say I was surprised. I had heard some of its 
members talk about war before, and I already knew they 
were aware of every major battle in the history of the 
modern world (and their outcomes, which, though 
allegedly immovable in history, can reverse themselves 
in Tioga Hall during these meetings: for instance, 
Napoleon has been known to beat Wellington at 
Waterloo, though it doesn't happen very often). In 
short, I knew there was a group of people on campus 
who weekly act out a particularly bizarre Set of fan-
tasies, and who probably know more about Napoleonic 
warfare than Napoleon. 

But still, I wasn't prepared. By the time I got there, 
there were three wars going: 

The most enthusiastic people in the room were 
engaging in a dogfight over Germany ("Hit on the right 
wing," one screamed, with the throw of a die. "I'm 
finished," sighed another.) 

Over in the corner, World War II was in session, 
between two rather slow, quiet types ("Novices," I was 
told . It worried me that these two ;novices' might just 
blow the Normandie invasion and ruin everything, but I 
supressed my anxieties, hoping their incompetence was 
at least matched . I still think they should start their new 
members on, say, the Mexican-American war. We could 
do better without Texas than the Western World .) 

Finally, two of the more experienced members were 
fighting a 1942 African battle I'd never heard of . ("That's 
a harder game," my guide said . "You've got the know 
how to supply lines so you can keep the troops going.") 

My partner and I, upon persuasion, decided to tryout 
Napoleon and Wellington at Waterloo. We were told 
that infantry, cavalry and artillery were represented by 
various squares of cardboard, with all sorts of cryptic 
symbols, letters and numbers. A turn consisted of 
moving all your pieces at once into positions of attack. 
After a move, the winner in the exchange is determined 
by the numbers on the pieces of cardboard, which set 
up odds, and the simple, fickle throw of a die. 

We were the British (a motley crew consisting mostly 
of Belgians, Dutch and Indians) and a weathered pro 
was the French. When I asked where Napoleon himself 
would be on the board, the pro pointed reverently at 
one of his blue squares . 

" There," he murmured. "He was one of the first 
generals who could control an army of this size from 
one spot on the battlefield . A general from each of his 
divisions would stay behind him all the time, so he 
could both be aware of the army's position and 
movements, and also give orders first hand." 

After the first confrontation, in which we were 
trounced bitterly, the Prussians entered, ostensibly to 
help us against the French. However, when someone 
lold me the Prusslan leader, a General Blucher, had 
been under the impression that he was pregnant by a 
member of Napoleon's Guard, I lost a little faith in the 
Prussians as a.llies. I was also told the rules didn't state 
specifically that th.e Prussians had to help us, and that 
their lunati c general could dt any time turn against us . 

At this point, I left my partner to continue without 
me. When I left, the African War was proceed ing nicely, 
and the dogfighters were at each other'S throats And 
though World War II was Virtually unchanged from 
when I'd arrived, I was somewhat unsure of what the 
state of the world would be the next morning

luse Allocations 
Organizations Occupy 

New Student Center 
by Ric. Drom 

At the close of last 
quarter, the Undergraduate 
Student Council (l.U.S.c.) 
formally allocated space in 
the new University Center 
and 250 M.C. to campus 
organizations. The 
organizations began to 
move in last week. 

fhe decision followed a 
week of hearings by a 
T.U.S.e . sub-committee to 
decide the space needs of 
student organizations. All 
interested clubs were in-
vited to attend one of these 
hearings and discuss their 
space needs. Over 50 clubs 
responded and requested a 
space in one of the 24 
rooms that were available. 

The sub-committee, 
composed of students from 
all three colleges and from 
the Graduate Student 
Council, made numerous 
recommendations as to the 
use of these spaces. All the 
recommendations were 
accepted by T.U.S.C. 

First it concluded that 
many of the clubs who 
asked for space were of a 
recreational-athletic nature. 
These included such clubs 
as the Soaring Club, the 
Lacrosse Club, the Ski Club 
etc . The sub-committee 
urged that these cI ubs 
appeal to the Athletic 
department for space and 
support. Due to this 
department's funding from 
student Registration Fees, 
the sub-committee felt that 
the Athletic department 

should assume respon-
sibility for these clubs. 

Secondly the sub-
committee recommended 
that this new allocation of 
space should be effective 
when the new student 
center opens, April 17th. All 
prior committments of 
space in 250 M.e. will no 
longer be valid after the 
center opens . Present 
holders of space in 250 M .C. 
should be prepared to 
vacate the space no later 
than the opening date of 
the new Center . 

Next, the sub-committee 
suggested that all space 
needs be reviewed again at 
the end of the Spring 
quarter. At this time it 
recommended that all 
space be reallocated on the 
basis of predicted needs for 
the 1'74-1975 academic 
year. 

It also recommended that 
T.U.S.C. periodically review 
the utilization of the rooms. 
If T.U .S.C. feels that the 
room is not properly being 
utilized, then T.U.S.C., after 
consultation with the club, 
should reallocate the space 
for better use. 

Finally the sub· 
committee pointed out that 
some space in the new 
Center had purposely been 
left unallocated, to allow 
flexibility. Use of this space 
can be determined later as 
new needs become ap-
parent. 

570 Grants Available 
The official opening of the 1975-76 competition for 

grants for graduate study or research abroad and for 
professional training in the creative and performing arts 
was announced today by the Institute of International 
Education. It is expected that approximately 570 awards 
to 50 countries will be available for 1975-76. 

The purpose of these grants is to increase mutual 
understanding between the people of the United States 
and other countries through the exchange of persons, 
knowledge and skills . 

Applicants must be U.S. citizens at the time of ap-
plicafion, who will generally hold a Bachelor's degree or 
its equivalent before the beginning date of the grant 
and, in most cases, will be proficient in the language of 
the host country. Except for certain specific awards,

Infertility 
Infertility will be the subject of a one-day seminar 

open to the public this Sunday at UCSD. 
Sponsored by University Extension, the seminar is 

titled " Infertility : Realities and Possibilities." It will 
deal with the ways the problem is caused, possible 
solutions, and alternatives open to people who do 
not succeed in finding a remedy. 

Psychologist and consultant Stephen E. Doyne and 
his wife Nancy will lead discussion, giving both a 
husband's and a wife's perspective on infertility. Dr. 
Doyne has also invited Dr . Marshall Taylor, an 
assistant clinical professor of reproductive biology at 
UCSD School of Medicine, to talk on the medical 
aspects of the problem, and Dr. Louis Bozzetti, an 
associat clinical professor of psychiatry, to address 
the psy hiatflc implications, that is, the stresses 
likely to affect both husband and wife in such a 
situation 

The seminar will be h Id 9 a.m. through 3.30 p.m.

"Goodness of His Heart" 
Students of the California State University and . 

Colleges will get more financial help in the ne)(t 
academic year if a proposal by Governor Ronald Reagan 
is adopted by the legislature's fiscal committees . 

The governor seeks a S300,OOO state expenditure to 
" lminister a federal student scholarship program that 
could result in an additional S9 million for students with 
financial need. 

According to Governor Reagan, the Federal Higher 
Education Amemdments of 1972 created a basic 
educational dpportunity grant program (BEOC) in-
tended to provide a foundation level of aid for needy 
college students. " In its first years," the governor said, 
"only about half of the S122 million appropriated 
nationwide for BEOG has been spent. Students from . 
low·income families have been denied these grants 
because of the program's administrative complexity and 
students lack of knowledge about it . State funding will 
lead to the availability of maximum participation by 
students and full implementation of this important 
concept of direct grants to worthy students." 

New York Tea Party 
Remember the New York Tea Party? 
It happened for the same reason as the Boston Tea 

Party, a reaction to a tax American colonists called 
unjust . On April 22, 1774, four months after the Boston 
affair, New Yorkers boarded the British ship London and 
" steeped" its cargo of tea in New York harbor. 

Now the 200th anniversary celebration of that event, 
under the direction of the New York City Bicentennial 
Commission, is only one focus of interest in schools 
here, where the city's role in American history is getting 
new scrutiny. 

Visits to landmarks, including preeminently Fraunces 
Tavern, surviving birthplac of the First Continental 
Congress, are the order of the day. School libraries are a 
focus for research . Museum displays and art exhibits 
also look toward the day. 

"High-school students are much more realistic today 
in these studies," says Dr . Ronale Lee Gaudreau . He us 
executive vice-president of the New York City Bicen-
tennial Corporation, a nonprofit corporation created by 
the City Council. 

Students are fascinated by politics, he says . 
" 'What are the mistakes of today?' they are asking . 

'What can we expect?' " 
"Actually (the students) are rediscovering Am rica . 

While there is some strong disillusionment in their 
attitude, there is keen interest, too, in what it takes to 
deal with the situation . Washington made som

Life-Planning 

"Life planning," that is 'taking charge' of the 
course of one's life, is going to be the subject of two 
programs at the htension. 

. The programs will deal with the planning of 
careers and activities, and with realizing fulfillment 
in relationships and other facets of life. 

Saturday MAy 4 is the date of a workshop on the 
subject for professional counselors, at the La Jolla 
Village Inn. Using an exper iment allorl'Jat, leader 
Ali.::e B. Sargent will provide counselors with up-ta-
date information which will be of value to them in 
helping other make decisions about their lives. 

Hours of the May 4 class are 9 a.m. to 5 p .m. A 
registration fee of S25 will cover luncheon at the Inn. 

Workshops with Dr. SarKent for the general public 
will meet on four Wedneseay evenings-May 8 
through May 29 - in Room 1101 of Tioga Hall on 
UCSD's Muir Campus. Some of the counselors who 
participate in the earl ier course are expected to assist 
with these sessions. 

Meeting time is 7'30 to 10 p.m. each Wednesday 
A f e of S 15 covers all four ses ions.

Raving Maniac 
Editor ' 

Mr. Powell 's article on Solzhenitsyn (TT, April 5) is 
rure propaganda full of half-truths, innuendoes, 
distortions, and ignorance. That Mr Powell has no 
knowledge of Solzhenitsyn has been thoroughly shown 
by Jerome Katsell 's March 15th article in answer to an 
earlier article on the same subject. It takes courage, I 
must admit, for Mr. Powell to continue to write on a 
subject that he obviously knows so little about. His 
present article is so replete with errors as to almost seem 
a parody. Firstly, Mr. Powell seems to be paranoic about 
the " 'liberal ' American press," and their supposed 
dedication to the promotion of this "anticommunist, 
bourgeois, elitist" author. The Western press did not 
di cover Solhenitsyn, nor did they make him famous. 
The courage and greatness of his writing did that . He 
was already established as the greatest Russian novelist 
of the 20th century lon'g before our " liberal American 
press" even mentioned him. 

Mr. Powell goes on to give us the "tr~th" about 
olzhenitsyn He is, according to Mr. Powell , opposed 

democracy, no patriot of the Soviet Union, and a 
" mediocre author at best." This last statement is never 
alluded to again, but I would be fascinated to hear Mr. 
Powell's "proof" of Solzhenitsyn's "m diocrity." That is, 
of course, provided that Mr. Powell did indeed ever read 
anything by Solzhenitsyn . rrom som of his statements 
It would seem not. 

On democracy, Solzhenitsyn states that he is 
disturbed by the lack of thical foundation> of Western 
democracy. This IS a far cry from Mr. Powell's assertion 
of hiS opposition to democracy. 

Mr Powell at last stumbles on one truth- that 
olzh nit yn is no patriot of the Soviet Union No, he 

Isn't a patriot of the Soviet Union, but he IS a devout 
patriot of RUSSia His call for the dissolution of the 

~ovlet Union IS a call for the end to Russia n domination 
()ver all non-Russian republics within the Soviet Union. 
I t shows the deSIre on his part for the development of a 
non-imperialist Russian nation , one free from the 
burden of tyranny over other nations. It is no coin-
( Idence that the boundary of the Soviet Union losely 
resembles that of the Imperial Russian Empire The 
latest Soviet census showed ethnic Russians to be in the 
minority in the Soviet Union. And yet an Intense 
program of Russification is being conducted In all the 
non-Russian areas of the Union . There is often an in-
tense hatred of Russians, and national fe~lim:s have 
threatened to erupt into open revolt in the Baltic 
countries, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, the Asiatic 
republics, and others . This is precisely what Amalrik in 
his book (Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 19841) 
forecast, and this is precisely what Solzhenitsyn strives 
to prevent by his call for an end to Rus;;an domination 
of these occupied countries. 

Mr Powell " proves" Solzhenitsyn's "naive and 
unrealistic" political thought by quoting Solzhenitsyn's 
antipathies toward modern cities and automobiles. 
Solzhenitsyn is violently opposed to the pollution and 
despoiliation caused by the modern industrial society, 
but thiS hardly makes him a "naive" political thinker . I 
think that there are a lot of conservationists who would 
\\onder at Mr Powell's statement, including this writer 

Mr Powell's whole paragraph on "human" and "civ il" 
rights IS full of idiotic statements and fuzzy thinking . In 
contrast to Mr. Powell's assertion that there are no 
"human rights," I ca ll his attention to the United 
'-!,ltIOns Universal 0 claration of Human Right; 
(December 10, 1948) to which the Soviet Union is a co-
"gner To state, as Mr: Powell does, that the Western 
npws organs rea ted " human rights" out of Western 
"oc l!'ty's "C ivil rights" for propaganda purposes is ab-
,urd 

I\\r Powell ends by calling all admirersof~oILhE'nitwn 
"bourgeOIs, elitist, and anticommunist," and the

THE LAWYER'S TYPIST: 
VARIATIONS ON A THEME 
BY PAUL SAMUELSON 

BY CHERYL PAYER 

Nora, who was Im-
proving her Mind with a 
night school course in , 
introductory economics, 
settled down to do her 
homework . That week's 
assignment was the chapter 
on international trade in the 
textbook for the course 
(which the instructor had 
assured the class was The 
Very Best , being the 
eventh edition of Paul 

Samuelson's Economics: An 
Introductory Analysis) 

She found it difficult to 
follow, and therefore 
boring, until her attention 
was suddenly caught by a 
passage which seemed to 
make more sense than the 
rest : 

A traditional example 
used to illustrate thiS 
paradox of comparative 
advantage is the case of the 
best lawyer in town who is 
also the best typist in town . 
Will he not specialize in law 
and leave typing to a 
secretary? How can he 
afford to give up precious 
time from the legal field , 
where his comparative 
advantage is very great. to 
perform typing activities in 
which he is efficient but in 
which he lacks comparative 
advantage? Or look at it 
from the secretary's point of 
view. She is less efficient 
than he in both activities, 
but her relative disad-
vantage compared with him 
IS least in typing. Relatively 
speaking, she has a com-
parative advantage in 
typing. 

So with cou ntries. 
Suppose America produces 
food with one-third the 
labor that Europe does, and 
produces clothing with one-
half the labor . Then we 
shall see that that Ameri ca 
has a comparative 
disadvantage in clothing-
this, despite the fact that 
America is absolutely ef-
ficient in everything. By the 
same token, Europe has a 
comparative advantage in 
clothing . (Samuelson , p. 
(47) 

Nora, you see, was in fact 
a typist, who worked for 
one of the partners in a law 
office . It was natural that 

she should perk up when 
she discovered that the 
difficult concept of 
comparative advantage in 
international trade was 
being explained with an 
example from her own life. 
Skipping briefly over the 
second paragraph, she 
returned to the first one to 
read it more slowly and 
carefully, for she felt an 
instant empathy with the 
secretary in the parable. 

Too much em pathy, 
perhaps. Her first reaction 
was an uneasy resentment 
at the idea that her boss 
might after all be superior 
to her in the realm of 
secretarial skills-the only 
marketable skill she had. It 
was bad enough, she 
thought, that he should 
know enough about the law 
to be able to comm.and high 
fees and to a pay her to do 
his office drudgery- but to 
deny that she had an ab-
so lute superiority in doing 
that kind of work, why, that 
was insult added to in-
jury!Even though she kept 
reminding herself that it 
was just a story , the sense of 
humiliation lingered. 

Nora turned back to 
study the paragraph again . 
"or look at it from the 
secretary's point of view . 
She is less efficient than he 
in both activities .... " At this 
point Nora snorted . Less 
effic ient in law practice! 
Nonexistent was a better 
word . How could one 
compare efficiency when 
she'd never even been to 
law school (even if she had 
picked up some of the 
techniques and the jargon ' 
through rendering 
assistance to Mr Wood-
bore, her boss) . 

She stopped laughing and 
began to think about it 
Denigrating as th 
paragraph in the textbook 
was to her, it had sti rred in 
her mind the first 
suggestion of the possibility 
that perhaps she ought to 
have the same ski lls which ' 
her boss was exercising, in 
order to make the example 
a fair test. What if (she 
choked with amusement at 
the idea) she turned out to 
be a more efficient lawyer 
than he? 

That delicious idea 
brought a further problem 
to her mind. Just how could 
efficiency be tested in such 
occupations? There were 
typing and dictation tests , 
of course, which measured 
your speed in each of those 
activi ties. But that, she 
knew, was only a small part 
of the skills which a really 
good secretary was ex-
pe<ted to have ; and , 
confident as she was that 
she was a good secretary , 
intelligent and reliable and 
discreet, she had no idea of 
how such qualities could 
ever be quantified . 

And how in the world , if 
she was a lawyer, could her 
eff ic iency in that activity be 
tested and measured 
against , say, that of Mr. 
WOQdbore? It just wasn't 
possible to time the 
preparation of legal briefs 
the same way one could 
clock typing speeds with a 
stopwatch, deducting errors 
from the total score. 

about Mr. Woodbore, his 
partners, and the other 
lawyers that she knew, she 
was not really satisfied with 
this hypothesis. She was not 
convinced that Mr . 
Wood bore, who was a 
senior partner and handled 
• lot of corporation work, 
was more efficient (for 
surely efficiency had 
something to do with in-
telligence and hard work) 

. than the young lawyers she 
knew who preferred to 
handle draft and civi l 
liberties cases--but he 
certainly earned a lot more. 
And as for what she knew 
about the earnings of 
women lawyers (she had 
met one or two)-well! she 
was not prepared to accept 
that as the measure of her 
efficiency when (if?) she 
became a lawyer. 

She read the passage in 
the text again . It certainly 
did imply that Professor 
Samuelson was equating 
effi ciency with the lawyers' 
earnings . The first 
paragraph , however, really 
didn't go far enough to give 
her an idea of what 
co mparative advantage 
would mean if she were a 
lawyer too, so she read the 
second paragraph carefully . 
Then she got out her paper 
and pencil and began to 
figu re, muttering out loud 
as she did 0 : 

" Now Mr . Woodbore 
earns $120 a day while I 

arn $30. If I am only one 
third as efficient as a lawyer 
and only one half as ef-
ficient as a secretary, that 
means I cou ld earn $40 a 
day as a lawyer and he 
could earn $60 as a typist. 
(That's ridiculous , even an 
Inefficient woman lawyer 
would earn more than an 
e)(tremely efficient male 
typist the way things are set 
up now, but I don't know 
how else to figure it .) Well, 
obviously he'd be worse off 
to be a secretary- but I'd be 
better off to be a lawyer 
even if I was a relative as 
well as an abso lute 
disadvantage there! 

" But if I have a relative 
advantage as a lawyer, 
being half as efficient as he 
is but only one third as 
efficient as a secretary, then 
I would be earning S60 as a 
lawyer while he earns S90 as 
a secretary (that's even 
more absurd, no secretary 
could possibly earn that 
much- I wonder why not?). I 
would be better off, but he 
certainly wouldn't be happy 
to take the cut in earnings. 
But Paul Samuelson seems 
to be sayi ng he ought to! 
That is, he would have if 
he'd worked it out as I'm 
doing. 

" But then he can't be 
correct when he argues that 
everyone would be better 
off to do what he or she has 
a relative advantage doing. 
Obviously anybody at all 
would be better off-
personally speaking-doing 
what pays the best (which 
In this case is practicing 
law), even if they're not as 
effi cient as somebody else." 

'JUlY A lmu UC ... lClAl ,"ANICS '01 'NI lIPTINO Of PlICI CONnOU , , " 

From her previous lessons 
in the Samuelson textbook , 
Nora had learned however 
that there was supposed to 
be a direct relationship 
between price and ef -
fj i ncy. Perhaps th ef-
ficiency of lawyers could be 
measured by what they 
earn d? But as h thought 

But if everybody were a 
lawyer and nobody did the 
typing, it would be an 
impossible situation . For 
the ake of argument Nora 
adopted an unselfish point 
of view and thought about 
th implications to National 
Income, rather than to her 
own salary, of the various 
combinations she had been 

P.lle 4 Triton Times, April 23, 1974 

by Cheryl Payer 
playing with. Nora had 
learned enough economics 
by now to know that 
National Income equals the 
sum of everybody's ear-
nings, so it was a simple 
e~ercise . (Another paradox 
of national income ac-
counting is the example of 
the man who marries his 
housekeeper. let us say that 
the man pays his 
housekeeper 13,000 a year 
for her services . When he 
does this, the national 
income grows by a like 
amount. But if he and the 
housekeeper marry, and she 
is no longer on salary, the 
national income is 
diminished by S3,OOO.) 

She discovered that in 
the case where it was 
hypotheSized that she had 
the relative advantage as a 
lawyer, it made no dif-
ference at all to the 
National Income if Mr. 
Wood bore worked full time 
as a lawyer at S120 a day 
and she as a typist at $30 a 
day ; if he worked full time 
as a typist at $90 a day and 
she as a lawyer at $60; or if 
both worked half a day at 
each task, in which Cdse his 
daily earnings would be 
$150 and hers would be $45 
The sum in all three cases 
would be $150. 

When she worked out the 
su ms on the opposite 
assumption--that her 
relative advantage was as a 
typist, not a lawyer- then 
the National Incom would 
fall, If she inSISted on 
working as a lawyer, from 
$150 a day to $100 But 
Nora was beginning to 
suspect by this time that 
this might have mor to do 
with the absolute level of 
typists' salaries rather than 
with the Inherent virtues of 
comparative advantages . 
After all, lawyers really 
couldn't produce any faster 
or more efficiently than the 
secretarial work relat ing to 
their work was done. And 
Nora did not forget that 
even when the National 
Income fell by one third , 
her salary would have gone 
up by one third if she were a 
lawyer rather than a 
secretary. 

Nora had decided by the 
end of the e)(ercise that the 
absolute disadvantage of 
being a secretary was a lot 
more important than any 
relative advantage to be 
had doing it efficiently. But 
Mr . Woodbore flatly 
refused to take a typing test 
when she showed her 
ca lculations to him the next 
day, and Nora applied to 
the local law school. She 
was accepted In the course 
because, under pressure of 
the women 's movement, 
the law school had upped 
its quota of female students 
from 5 to 15 percent. Since 
he has not graduated yet, 

we do not know whether 
she will find it to her ad-
vantage to hire a secretary 
to do her typing for her 
when she begins to practice 
law. 

She wi II be eternally 
gratefu I to Professor 
Samuelson for showing her 
(albeit probably against his 
will) where her true interest 
lies She has not, however, 
opened his textbook since 
that fateful evening and 
o asionally still wonders 
whether the truths she 
dis overed apply also to 
trade between nations,

Clarification 
Editor, 

We would l ike to 
comment on a recent ar-
ticle " The Most Common 
Mental Disorder" which 
appeared in the Triton 
Times . 

Although depression is 
indeed a significant 
psychiatric illness affecting 
a large number of people, 
there is much misun-
derstanding regarding its 
definition, cause, and 
treatment . Specifically we 
would like to clarify the 
following points: . 

1. Depression refers to a 
co nstellation of in -
terdependent biologic, 
psychologic, and socia l 
symptoms . It resembles but 
must be differentiated from 
the normal human 
responses of sadness and 
grief, and from transient, 
situationally dependent 
episodes of tension , 
an)(iety, and unhappiness. 

2. Certainly the pressures 
of academiC striving, which 
are concentrated at exam 
times, produce substantial 
discomfort and stress in 
many, if not all, students. 
However, we are concerned 
when Mr. Drom states that 
many students feel " that 
their brains have melted 
down. In ffect, they have", 
and then goes on to equate 
these feelings with the 
psychiatriC diagnosis of 
depression . Some, but not 
all , depressions are believed 
to involve specific changes 
in brain biochemistry. 
However , this ce rta i nly 
does not mean that all 
downswings in mood in-
vo lve these same 
biochemical changes. 

3. r or some recurrent 
and non-situationally 
dependent forms of 
depression, a course of drug 
therapy or elect roshock 
therapy can be the treat-
ment of choice . Although 
lithium carbonate is suc-
cessfully used in the mani c 
phase of mani c-depressive 
illness, its usefulness for 
other mood disorders is 
much less clear . 

4. The effectiveness of 
electroshock therapy is 
believed to be related to 
specific changes in brain 
metabolism produced by 
brain seizures and not 
to " turning off the mind" 
or stopping " the patient 
from thinking about 
whatever it is that he is 
preoccupied with ." 

5. The student who is 

concerned about his own 
functioning might seek 
consu ltation at the UCSD 
counselling center. Through 
individual and group 
psychotherapy , the 
counsell ing center offers 
students an opportunity to 
deal with cu rrent 
depressions and on-going 
pressures. The counsell ing 
center can also identify and 
refer for appropriate care 
those individuals suffering 
from the kind of depression 
which might require the 
more vigorous treatments 
recommended by Mr. Drom 
in h is article.

And now, due to the overwhelming lack 
of demand for the return of the selected 
jocks column (along with an even more 
overwhelming need for copy), the Triton 
Times Sports Department proudly disowns 
the following printed material as having no 
visible relat ionship to the above 
mentioned department and removes any 
doubt that the following is of any value 
whatsoever to the UCSD community. It is 
for this reason that we the writers ask you 
to read this column anyway. 

Our congratulations go to the new 
World Football League, who with the 
careless toss of S3.8 million managed to do 
what no NFL team had in the last two 
years. The Toronto Northmen of the WFL 
"picked up" Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and 
Paul Warfield and thus broke up the short-
lived Miami Dolphin dynasty, but ap-
parently forgot their elementary 
econom ics, as all three wi II receive full 
payment whether or not they play. 

In the basketball scene, Bill Walton, 
who along with the UCLA Bruins was 
awarded the " All-America Choke" Award 
by the SJ staff for the en~ of another 
dynasty, managed with the flip of a coin 
what it took W .e. Fields a lifetime to do-
Get out of Philadelphia . 

Still more basketball news comes from 
the offices of the ABA· who decided 
recently that they would be willing to 
move a franchise to the city of Walton's 
choice if Walton would only sign with the 
ABA. To this, the SJ staff suggests that the 
ABA move the San Dielw Conquistadores 
to Helix High School, in La Mesa) so that 
Walton can live at home . 

I n another nostalgic return to the last 
column of SJ, you will remember that

Charlie Finley was awarded the " Boob-of-
the-Year" Award for signing up a bouncing 
base stealer, Herb Washington . As you will 
remember , Washington was the 
professional &0 yard sprinter who was 
coached for a week by Maury Wills on how 
to steal bases. Well, since the season has 
started, Washington has had three chances 
to prove his critics wrong. The result? 
Washington has been caught stealing 
twice because he was too slow at getting a 
jump on the pitcher . 

Hitting closer to home (if you will ex-
cuse the pun), the San Diego Padres 
receive the congratulations of the SJ taff 
for their spectacular start in league games, 
as they now occupy the cellar of the 
National League West with an out-
standing 4· 13 record, following an 
exhibition season in which they won nine 
of their last ten games. To this the SJ staff 
can only comment that even all the 
MacDonalds hamburgers in San Diego 
can't improve the performance of the 
Padres. Maybe Padre's owner Ray Kroc 
should try an easier task, like getting 
Ralston Purina to sell him a Jack-in-the-Box 
franchise . 

In even more baseball news (we don't 
often run dry this quickly, folks) when 
Henry Aaron does things, he does them in 
style. Not only did Aaron hit his record 
breaking home run In Atlanta (as he had 
wanted), but of his first three hits of the 
season, all three were home runs . Aaron 
was good to his promise that he wanted to 
get this thing over as fast as possible . 

And now, probably to the relief of all 
those hardy souls still with us, The SJ staff 
sadly announces the end of this in-
stallment of 51. For the one of you who is 
still interested, SJ will be back as soon as 
we come up with some more material, and 
as soon as the Sports Page is in dire enough 
need to print this garbage on its hallowed 
confines .

Cal Baptist 
In an excellent display of 

pitching and defense the 
UCSD baseball team 
defeated Cal Baptist in a 
double header last 
Saturday, 2'{), ancl5-1 . 

Randy Miller's pitching 
and Curt Jenkins hitting 
spearheaded the 2-0 first 
game win . Miller pitched 
five strong innings to pick 
up the victory . Jenkins went 
three for three at the plate 
to lead the Triton hitters . 
Bob Lofgren saved the 
game for Miller by shutting 
out Cal Baptist over the last 
two innings. 

Lofgren came back to 
start the second game. He 
pitched the first five innings 
of that game to pick up the 
victory . Jeff Wiederholt 
came on to pitch the last 
four innings, preserving the 
victory for Lofgren . Curt 
Jenkins played another fine 
game, along with left-
fielder David Lettuca and 
second baseman Fred Cribi . 
All three provided clutch 
hits and sound fielding in 
the 5-1 se~ond game win .

Volleyball Team finished 
their season last Friday 
Night with a rather un-
spectacular and quite 
humiliating loss to San 
Bernardino Valley College 

The Tritons were given 
three surprizes when they 
arrived for their warm-ups 
1)that Gene Selznik, "Mr 
Volleyball" himself, would 
be present, and would 
possibly play in the game; 
2) that Darryl Ruko, one of 
the best sandball, and also 
indoor, players would play 
for the team form San 
Bernardino, and 3) that the 
Tritons would have quite a 
fight on their hands , 
con trary to what they had 
expected from the an -
nounced JC which turned 
out to be a full four-year 
college. 

As it was, the Tritons did 
not seem able to get started 
as they fell behind 5-0 in the 
first game, and only with 
trouble were they able to 
pull to 14-9 before losing. 

In the second game, the 
Tritons again fell behind 2-0 
but began to show their 
potential as they grabbed a 
short-lived lead of 5-2 . From 
this point on tile battle was 
close , but substitution 
problems caused some 
mixups that led to UC5D's 
15-10 loss.

There were no really 
outstanding players for 
UCSD, but Bruce Cazden, 
playing with a painfully 
sore shoulder, did manage 
some good spikes and 
blocks teaming with Tim 
Myrick and Steve Simpson 
on the blocks. A surprize in 
the game was Marc Durrett, 
who showed that he could 
play front row as well as 
back row, when he was 
forced to replace Simpson 
in the front when the 
Tritons ran out of sub-
stitutions in the second 
game. 

Due to an accute lack of 
funds, the Triton spikers 
will not be travelling to 

Chicago to participate in 
the NAIA ationals, the 
weekend of May 4 and 5, 
and the NAIA District III 
Championships, scheduled 
for th is weekend, have been 
ca lled off because the NAIA 
did not want to fund a two-' 
team district playoff . 

The prospects for next 
year look extremely good, 
as all but one of the team 
members are sophomores 
that year, and therefore all 
are expected to return next 
season with the added 
experience wh ich was so 
obviously lacking this year

Book IV 

Low 
Blo~s 

by Edward Simons Shots 
So there they were; Moses, Aurelius, and the people of Israel. Nothing lay between 

them and the prom ised land but seemingly endless miles of scorching desert. As the 
Hebrews turned their backs on the Wet Sea, they gazed in awe at the trackless wastes 
before them . All voices died, all laughter was stifled while they considered the Barren-
Mojo. 

Barren-Mojo; ageless and cruel. Many had died in her arid embrace, her kisses of 
sand. What secrets she knew she kept to herself , though she taunted men with her 
inviting whispers in the dark of the night. Few men claimed to have ever mastered 
Barren-Mojo. Those who survivE:d a trek across her merely said that it must have been 
a caprice of hers , a sly joke she shared with no one. No one alive ... 

Of course, this was all before the road crew came. Now, the black ribbon of asphalt 
called (rather optimistically) River Street bisected the Barren-Mojo into two parts : 
The first part and the second. Actually, they were known by the names Upper Barren-
Mojo and Lower Barren-Mojo. This was odd, particularly when one realizes that the 
road ran north-south . But since no one had ever heard of a Righter Volta or a Lefter 
Volta, etc., the Commission took the easy way out. 

"Well," Aurelius sighed, "here we are." 
"Yes," agreed Moses, "here we are." 
The Israelites took it up as a battle cry. "Here we are!" they yelled. "Here we are, by 

damn l Yes, here we most certainly are!" 
Moses shook his head and wiped the sleep from his eyes. " Head 'em up!" he yelled . 

"Move 'em out!" 
The people weren't expecting the herald trumpet fanfare but move they did . In 

every direction . A few had already waded chest high into the Wet Sea before Moses 
called another huddle . 

"I've got a better idea," he said. "Follow me." 
And so it was that River Street was host to the greatest parade ever to tread across 

Barren-Mojo. Maybe not the best, but the greatest. 
Thus they went along for some miles before Moses called a halt. 
"Aurelius, around this corner there is a fork in the road . Go and bring it back to 

me ," 
Sure enough, just around the corner there was a fork, though not the type Moses 

had implied . Aurelius told him so. 
"Oh, I get it," Moses laughed . "that kind of fork . Okay let's see what the map says ." 
He opened the map and ran a tobacco stained finger across it. 
"Ah , here we are," he said . 
"Here we are, by damn! " yelled the Hebrews . " Here we most-" 
"Shut up! " Moses screamed. He returned to the map. "The way I see it, Marc, we've 

got two choices . Right or left. " Marcus shook his head. "Right is the business route 
a nd will take longer; left is the truck route. We might make some time on that one." 

Marcus rubbed his chin . "Okay," he said finally, "let's go left ." 
'Tine," said Moses, "left it is . Follow me, lsrael !" 
The two diverging roads were not labeled "Right" or "Left". They were labeled 

"Hope" and "Despair", respectively . 
A few Levites came to Moses and asked him why the road they were taking was 

called Despair. 
"Someone', i ea of a joke," he muttered, rolling his eyes heavenward .

P."e 8 Triton Times. April 23, 1974 

The Journey through Barren-Mojo was not going to be an easy one. The herds of 
cattle and sheep that the Hebrews had filched from the Pharoah's stock yards were 
few in number now. Water was scarce and becoming scarcer. It was getting to be the 
whole slave trip all over again . 

The people of Israel were beginning to bemoan their fate . "Why did you bring us to 
starve in the desertr" they asked Moses. 

"Because," Moses explained. 
But something needed to be done. So Moses got in tou.ch with the Lord and 

discussed it with him . 
"Lord, these people are going to drive me to an early grave with their complaining." 
The Lord chuckled as at some secret joke. "Don't worry about that, Moses . You've 

got a few years yet ." 
"What am I to do? 'rhese people are hungry," Moses pleaded. 
"That's easy, Moses. Every day before sunrise, a white, flaky wafer-type food will 

form on the ground . I call it dandra . Clever, ehl And when the people grow tired of 
that I' ll divert some quail your way. Be sure to tell the Israelites not to be greedy. 
We're on a limited production schedule up here and turn out just so much at a time." 

"But if someone takes too much, how will he be punished?" Moses pressed 
"Let him eat it." replied the Lord . "He' ll be sorry soon enough ." 
"That bad?" Moses asked . 
"Worse," said the Lord . " It reminds me of the taste of wild Euell Gibbons." 
And Moses told the Israel ites what the Lord had said . 

... 

Were any cookbooks of that era exta'nt, they would certainly show an enormous 
amount of variations on the old quail-and-dandra number. Quail stuffed with dandra, 
dandra stuffed with quail, sand and quail casserole, dandra and asphalt, etc . Still, the 
Israelites were happier and persevered . 

Yet there was still much to complain about. 
"Moses," the people complained, "we are tired of living like we want to. We need 

laws to restrict us, to keep us from having fun . What good is being free if we can do all 
we want?" 

"Alright," Moses sighed, " I'll bring up the matter in tomorrow's meeting." 
The next morning, after Moses left for Mount Ten, preparations got under way for 

the biggest bash of the season . It was to be, as the hand bills advertised , "The Baccha 
to end all Nalias"; a free swinging- no holds barred-anything goes debauch, replete 
with all thE' necessities . "The Last Gasp Ball" it was called . 

The chairman of the party committee was a little uneasy. The party needed a 
theme, a little something to be the center of attractions . Maybe Aurelius would have 
a few ideas. 

"Any ideas, Marcus?" 
Marcus was lost in thought . (In fact , it was said Marcus was lost in one thing or 

another for the whole of his life .) 
" It has to be gold ... " 
"Yes?" the chairman probed. 
" I've got it! A peccary. Who ever heard of a peccary? No one with any taste, 

anyway. It'll make a great conversation piece." 
The chairman chiseled out a quick sketch . "Like this, Marcus?" 
"No, no no!" Marcus gasped in shock, "i t's an animal , you spasmodic filth. It looks 

like this ." 
Quickly, he erased the obsidian tablet and drew something that looked more like a 

frog than a peccary. "Ah , well. The goldsmiths will get the idea." 
And they did 
On Mount Ten, Mose was getting the business . 
"Look around you, Moses . What do you see?" 
"Barren-Mojo," Moses replied. 
"Moses," the Lord confided, "you're looking at your future ." 
"What?" Moses cried . "Won 't I get to see the land of milk and expresso-Conan- that 

you've been telling me about? How long will we be in Barren-Mojo?" 
"Only forty years," the Lord sa id soothingly. 
"Well , that's a little bit better," Moses pouted . 
wOf course, at the end of those forty years you'll croak ." 
"Die?" Moses asked in disbelief. 
"Deader than you ever believed possible, 01' buddy," the Lord drawled . 
"But why? I've done everything I should, Lord, haven 't I?" 
" I wish I could help you, Moses. But you're so ugly that I'm forced to recall your 

body . You know, you're something of an embarassment up here. Sorry it's that way," 
the Lord coughed, "but it is ." And the Lord saw that Moses was crushed so He said, 
"Aw, don't let it bother you . I' ll send you a couple of postcard~ ." 

"Thanks" was all Moses could find to say. 
" But we're here for other reasons, aren't we? So they want some commandments, 

eh? Ten's a good, round number . See those two tablets over there, MosE's?" the Lord 
asked, pointing. 

"The ones marked 'Bayer'?" 
"Right on, Moses. Upon these tablets I will write my Ten Commandments. Watch 

this!" 
The Lord picked up a pneumatic hammer and began on the first tablet. The whole 

mountain shook and tlie lightning flashed . 
"Number one!" the Lord announced. "I am the Lord thy god, and there's little to 

nothing you can do about it!" 
Again He chiseled at the tablets . 
"Number two! Reconcile yourselves to number one!" 
The air hammer pounded again. 
"Number three! I don't like peccaries and you shouldn't eitherl"

The wind was blowing hard now and it was with great effort that Moses watched 
the Lord wield the hammer. 

"Number four, by billy damn! Thou shalt not have parties which have peccaries for 
a theme!" 

"Number fivel Thou shalt not kill!" 
The storm's ferocity abated as the Lord slipped in another carbide tip to use on the 

other tablet. Then, once more the earth trembled with the impact. 
"Number six! Just to make number five easier I now command you : Thou shalt not 

die!" 
"Number seven! Thou shalt not steal!" 
"Number e ight! Thou shalt not lie" 
"Number nine! Thou shalt not commit adultery!" 
The mountain quaked more violently than ever. The fierce wind pinned Moses 

against a boulder. Through a haze of sand and gravel, Moses saw the Lord grasp the 
hammer for the last time. The tablet disappeared in a fury of flying aspirin . 

"Number ten! Thou shalt not get caught!" 
Almost at once the hammer disintegrated into a shower of sparks-due, no doubt, 

almost entirely to a lightning bolt the size of the Queen Mary. Suddenly, the 
mountain was at peace again . 

Moses fell out of his stupor and stumbled over to the tablets . Carefu lly, he 
examined them . 

"Looking for the fine print; Moses?" the Lord chuckled. 
"No!" Moses averrred . 
"Well, if these meet with your approval, you can take 'em down to the Israelites 

now. If I have to deal with that mob again they just might wind up a nation of 
turkeys ." 

"Yes, Lord," Moses returned. "Bye!" 
"See you later," said the Lord. 
Moses fairly flew down the mountain . He didn't stop running till he was in sight of 

the party . When he did stop, his heart sank . There before him was the Hebrew nation 
in full debauch . "After alii do for them," he thought, "and they can't even wait for me 
to return ." 

With bowed head, Moses entered the camp, dodging revelers on his way to his split 
level tent. Marcus Aurelius accosted him holding his head in both hands. 

"Moses! What am I gonna do? I've got a hangover that won't quit," moaned 
Marcus. 

"H re," Moses replied, handing him the tablets, "take two of these and see me in 
the morning ."

The odor of late afternoon , tinged with a definite air of express, hU1g over the 
mountainside where Moses sat Maybe it was the'red disc of the ~u n , sbwly failing

"Lord, now that I'm dying, could I ask you a questlon1" 
"Shoot " 
"What, Lord , is the meaning and purpose of life?" 
"To make a fast buck," the Lord kidded 
"No, really," Moses persist d 
"You'll flOd out soon enough , Moses . You can't know the purpose of life till you're 

dead " 
"No doubt, the best time to learn it," Moses snorted. 
"Don't get sarcastic, Moses. That's the rules," explained the Lord 
"But you make the rules,". Moses countered 
"Ah , but what good are rules if they are broken?" 
Moses closed his eyes and Sighed a great sigh . "Why me?" he mumbled, dropping 

off into his last sleep, 'Why me?" 
The Lord looked upon Moses sadly, shaking His head slowly. "Jesus Christ! How 

impatient can you get?" 
And a wondrous soft voice filled the darkening firmament "Father, " it said, "you've 

been skipping ahead again ."

Editor's Note 

These books are the complete translated text of ancient scrolls found in an old 
mason jar under an abandoned duplex on the shore of the Expresso Sea . Though 
dicovered in 1947, it was only recently that a team of Jesuit scholars found the key to 
the Expresso Sea Scrolls. They weren't in English! So, the scrolls were given to the 
language department of the prominent university where they were translated IOto 
English . 

The original text presented several problems to the translator-not the least of which 
being the writer's flequent spasmodic fits. Evidence of thi s was found 10 the discovery

Pile I) Triton Tima, April 23, 1974 



Music: Mike Sesma 

Jimmy Buffet 
The first time I saw Jimmy Buffet was on a beautiful 

August Sunday at a free KSDT / KPRI concert at the 
UCSD athletic field He was there warming up the 
crowd for the Georgia sound of the Marshall Tucker 
Band , The fi rst words ' he spoke endeared him to the 
crowd of about 6000, " I just finished two weeks at the 
Troubador, and this place sure beats the shit out of L.A ." 

Jimmy then proceeded to play and sing to the people 
some music to fit the day ... WHY DO 'T WE GET 
DRUNK AND SCREW, THEY DON'T DANCE LIKE 
CARMEN NO MORE, PEANUT BUTTER CONSPIRACY, 
other songs that would seem to tell of h is personal 
experiences, Most of the songs were from his first 
album, " A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean ." 
When I got it, it was one of those albums that I just had 
to play for my friends , 

Anyway, what this artic le is all about is Jimmy's new 
album, Living and Dying in 3/4 time, featuring Jimmy's 
second Coral Reefer Band , Buffet's background is Nash-
ville and Key West and the diversity of his talent was 
immediately evident from the music on his fi rst album , 
He is now working movie scores for directors Arthur 
Penn and Robert Altman and at the same time acting, 

. He continues to show his ability for story telling in 
music in Living and Dying, 

Jimmy's songs are often about very personal ex-
periences or daydreams that never materialize, 'Pen il 
Thin Mustache' recalls TV heroes, 'Come Monday' is an 
ent irely different mood, a love lament in the fashion of 
Croce's better known 'Operator.' 'The Wino and I Know' 
another song about Buffet's experience with inebrieity 
and a song that will become a classic if it ever gets air 
tim ".Cod's Own Drunk , .. a six-minute monologue set 
to musi c dealing with a brother's dutiful guarding pf a 
~ttll, and then meeting a " Kodiak type fella 'bout19 feet 
tall " The yarnspinner then gets drunk with " Buddy 
Ilear" and in the process passes out. When he wakes, 
hoth the bear ana the still are gone. 

The pedal steel guitar of Doyle Gresham permeates 
nearly every song on the album, and the harmonica of a 
recent UCSD guest, Greg "fi ne-:ers" Taylor lend some fi ne 
get-down-to-it moods to all of Buffet's cuts, The Mike 
Utt ley keyboards add a lot to Jimmy's lonely Martin . 

Hut if you don't bel ieve all this ta lk about an ex-
L ptional musician and si nger come see for yourself this 
Thursday, April 25, at noon in or around the new 
Student Center. I promised Jimmy if he ever came back 
here, I would be happy to buy that case of O ly. 
However, if you do believe this one man testimonial , 
give the guy a break and go out and fi nd his 
album ,LIVING AND DYING IN 3/ 4 TIME ... it's really 
tine Better yet find his first album too .. ,A WH ITE 
SPORT COAT AND A PINK CRUSTACEAN .. ,after all 
two IS better than one

mistakes, too, they are saying." 

A student at a bicentennial workshop declares, "We 
didn't have perfect leaders then either We should talk 
about how it rea lly was ," 

At another workshop, a high-sc hooler says : 
"There is nothing like America , It's a nation of im-

'migrants, and if you bring back pride in the original 
backgrounds of people, they ca n have pride in what 
they are now and in what they can be in the future," 

Horse and Bugs 
(S O Door) Ju stice Department officials in the 

Ba ltimore area have been seiz ing electronic listening 
devices from loca l automobile dealers, devices which 
have be n used as part of a covert sales schem e. 

According to the- US Attorney's office in Baltimore, 
the list n ing trategy is "common practice" in the auto 
sa les industry. The way the schem e works is simple: 

A sales person 's private office is bugged with a wire 
leading to a speaker in another nearby office . The sales 
person completes the sales pitch, and then leaves 
potential customers-perhaps a husband and wrife-by 
themselves in the office , 

In stepping down the hall, the sales staff can overhear 
the couple talk over the pros and cons of the car , 
whether they like the salesperson or how much they are 
really willing to spend , 

A few minutes later, say government investigators, 
the sales person reappears . As if by magic, the sales 
representative answers most of their questions, dispels 
their doubts, and often ends up selling them a car they 
may not want. (ZNS)

the government know what 
you think about their plans; 
you should try to be present 
for this meeting.

You really think you're saving 
something. Like the time it takes for 
proper lens care. And the cost of dif-
ferent solutions. But in the long run 
you may wind up paying for short 
cuts. There's a chance your contacts 
will become contaminated. They'll 
probably feel uncomfortable and 
bother you. You may even get an eye.

chances with saliva?
