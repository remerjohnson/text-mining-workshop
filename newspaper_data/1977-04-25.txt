Council Approves Padre Loan Plan 

The San Diego Padres and the San Diego City Council are in the 
ninth inning of their duel over how the baseball club will pay back its 
promotional loan totbe city. 

The council last week approved a plan whereby the Padres have 10 
years to repay the $2,145,000 advanced to it by the city over the team's 
first seven years of existence. 

Under the new plan-approved by the council by a 6-2 vote-the 
Padres will repay the loan in ten equal installments; the old contract, 
rejected by the club, mandated repayment based on attendance of 50 
cents per bead over 800,000. 

Life-Without -Parole Bill Fails 
Opponents of the death penalty fell one vote short in the state Senate 

last Thursday when they attempted to gain passage of legislation 
mandating llfe-without-parole prison sentences instead of death for 
specified crimes. 

The measure was rejected although winning the vote 20-17; 21 votes 
are needed for passage in the 4O-seat senate. 

However, the bill's author, Sen'. Milton Marks (R-San Francisco), 
said after the vote he hopes to pick up additional support for a future 
vote on the measure, which would provide the llfe-without-parole 
sentence for 16 different crimes. 

Death penalty opponents hope the bill could serve as an alternative 
to the death penalty bill the senate passed last month. 

Solar Energy Displays Provide 
Main Attraction at Earth Day 

"What do you think of this Earth 
vay?" 

"Is that what day it is?" Earth 
Day, Aprill 22, 1977: Revelle Plaza. 
Seems more like Solar Energy Day 
than an Earth Day.

"Do you know what noise annoys

Cash Requested to "Secure Border" "A noisy noise annoys an oyster -and you too! " I should've hazarded ., ~ e 
a guess. m 

The United States Immigration and Naturalization Services is 
requesting $96-million over the next two years to construct a steel 
fence between San Diego and Tijuana in order to "secure the border," 
INS head Gen. Leonard F. Chapman said in San Diego last week. 

Ab, there's the San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. Their table is 
crowded, but I manage to snatch a 
pamphlet as a gap opens 
momentarily in the crowd. t look at 
the title. " Solar Energy: For Your

wonder if they'll change their 
name to San Diego Gas, Electric &

"We plan to replace the fence that IS there now with a modern fence '

said.

"The idea of the fence is if you can't cut through it or climb it, then 
you have to go around. The fences will be set up where there are 
companion border cities. The San Diego fence probably will end 
somewhere along the mesa."

" It's better than reading about 

solar energy in Time magazine," 
relates an enthusiastic student. 
"We get a chance to see it really 
happening." I hope they have a 
solar calculator here. 

The Friends of the Earth pose 
me a question: " What's the use of a 
house if you haven 't got a planet to 
put it on?" That's a good question, 
I think to myself . I felt the same 
way when I first read it in my 
pocket Thoreau.

at noon, according to the government Transition Team. The results will 
then be printed in Wednesday's Triton Times.

We will. Next time Carter tells the

Psych Experiments: A Look Behind Grey Walls 
by Ran Anbar 

Assistant Maoaglng Editor 

Are you one of those people who 
grudgingly awakes to (in alarm, turns it off, 
then falls back to sleep? Or perhaps are you 
the type of person who never seems to have 
money for more than ten minutes? 

According 10 Dr. Edmund Fantino of the 
Psychology department, your problem is 
"for the birds"-literally. Fantino sees it as 
a problem of "commitment vs. self-
control," and with the aide of graduate 
student Bill Whipple, is studying the notion 
using pigeon!l. 

In one version of the experiment, pigeons 

are presented with a choice of pecking at a 
key, which has turned red in color, or to wait 
for the key to turn green. If they peck at the 
red key the pigeons will be presented with a 
small reward such as bird seed. However, 
there is some fowl play inherent with such 
an action, as no more food will be 
forthcoming for some time. On the other 
hand, if the pigeons choose to wait for the 
green light, they receive a large reward and 
no time penalty. 

In other words, haste makes waste. 
"Get Thee Behind Me ... " 

Fantino believes that the results seem 
familiar if you are acquainted with human 
behavior. If the time delay between f:he red 

and green light is more than several seconds 
the pigeon will peck at the red key even 
though it is a poor choice (and similarly you 
missed your midterm because your alarm 
was too close to the bed ). Just as you might 
move your alann out of reach in order for it 
to prove more effective, the pigeons will 
always opt to prevent the red light from 
coming on by pecking at another key (so 
they will not be tempted by it). 

Of course not all the research sponsored 
by the Psychology department is done with 
birds. Some experiments use subjects of 
slightly higher evolutionary order: man. 

that location and pitch perceptions are 
separate and don 't " talk" to each other. 

Additionally, Deutsch is also refining a 
technique to detennine which hemisphere of 
the brain is dominant by observing per-
ception of sound sequences. This might 
prove an important consequence in 
neurosurgery, where such a test could prove 
an important alternative to surgery in 
detennining dominant'e. 

J. Anthony Deutsch has found rats more 
conducive to his research-which is the 
testing of physostigmine, a very potent 
poison. The drug has strong effects on 
memory, seemingly causing rats to im-
mediately forget such things as their maze 
routes, only to remember them after s~eral 
days. 

a 

Don MacLeod is using such "subjects" in 
investigating afterimages in vision. He 
explains that it helps to understand the 
mechanisms of sensitivity in the eye. 
Although Ben Franklin observed such ef-
fects over 200 years ago, there are still no 
practical applications to the research. 
MacLeod explained that he continues to do 
such research because " anything could tum 
out to be a major contribution in the field . " 

Two other Psychology department 
researchers, Diana and J . Anthony Deutsch, 
are separately conducting a number of wide 
ranging experiments-both on humans and 
animals. 

Auditory IlIu ions 

In West Africa the drug has been used on 
humans for judiciary proceedings. It has 
been s en that witnesses suspected of lying 
are forced to drink a cup of the drug. Legend . 
has it that if the suspect is lying he will die, 
while if he has been telling the truth he will 
remain alive. Naturally, modern 
psychology ha answers for such events. 
They say that such a situation makes s nse, 
as tho e who had told the truth would drink 
the poi on contie. ently and quickly , only 
later to omit, ",t He those who lied would 
drink the poi on lowly, not vomit, and di . 

Diana Deutsch is currently involved in 
experiments dealing with auditorY,illusions 

.. among others. UCSD students have been 
.>t participating in a number of such ex-~ periments in which they listen to a series of 
'i tones and indicate how they perceive a 
Ul 
o certain property of the series. From such 
~ results Deutsch has been trying to deter-
0. mine how it is that humans lump in-~ fonnation from the outside world to form

alcoholics during withdrawal. Deutsch hopes 
to apply his results to help out some of the 
10 000,000 American alcoholics.

Thjrd Sets General Assembly 
To Study Original Goals 

Third College will bold a 
General Assembly Apr. 28, the 
first such a gathering lince 1m, 
according to Maraha Harris, 
Third College Council (TCC). 
"One of our prime goals this year 
W88 to have • General Allem-
bly," she said. 

"It will include people from 
Third College," said Harris, 
listing student interDI, com-
mittee members, and Third 
Recnlitmera and Admi8aions 
Committee (TRAC). Speakers 
will lnclucIe the Provost, Dean, 
faculty members and students, 
addressing topics such as "the 
need to be involved" and 
propositions on &be Spring ballot 
which concern Third College 
specifically. 

"We're supposed to meet once 
a quarter, but people really get 
busy," remarked Gilbert Urlza, 
TCC. "It's bard to get students 
together," he said, "but we're .t 
a point where there are a lot ~ 
crucial tbinp happening."

drifting from its original plan," 
he felt. " Another issue ~ im-
portance for the Assembly is the 
new government. Our relations 
with the ASUa;D will be dif-

The meeting, to be held at 1Uf

students, faculty, and ad-
ministration get together to go 
through specific issues," said 
Uriza. " Input will be gathered 
from all sides." 

•• A lot of it is to get feedback on 
where we stand with the AS," 
Harris couunented. "H students 
don't come, they'D be missing out 
on a lot, especially for those 
decisions concerning next year 
which will be discussed." Harris 
felt ~t of particu1ar concern 
would be Provost Joseph Wat-

will be discussed after his return 
from Sacramento to discuss the 
plans.

Experiments.~ 
ContlDued from P.ge 1 

One application of I)e>'tsch's 
research is seen through his study 
of Valium-considered by some 
experts as an aid in withdrawing 
from alcohol. Deutsch took two 
groups ofalcd\olic rats, injecting 
one of the groups with Valium, and 
leaving &be other group free of 
drugs. The rats were then 
presented with a choice between 

alcoholic and non-alcoholic nuid. AB 
was expected, the Valium rats 
drank less alcohol than the non-
Valium rats during the first day. 
However, it was seen that after 
four days those rats not treated 
with ValilDD retreated to non-
alcoholic levels of consumption, 
while those treated with ValiIDD 
remained close to their original 
level of alcoholic consumption.

Dear Doc: Wbat Important 

event was coocluded February 
20,1917, at the New York Hal} of 
Sclence? Is there aoy truth to the 
rumor that a slmUar event will 
bappen at UCSD this quarter? 
Signed, Cellulose Aerophlle 

February 20, 1967, is a day that 
will live in infamy as the historic 
date of the first International 
Paper Airplane competition. The 
event was sponsored by avia-
tion magazine called Scleotlfic 
Americao. UCSD may have its 
own such event this quarter if 
there is enough interest. 
Interested students should send 
their best shots at Mike Hipp of 
the recreation department. 
Although Mike has nothing to do 
with the proposed competition, if 
enough people throw paper 
airplanes at him he 'll make sure 
the organization planning the 
event gets going on it. Then 
again, he might just throw one 
back at you. 

Dear Doc: What was the 
vlrgloity clinic of last quarter all 
about, aod what ever happened to 
It. Signed, Afflicted 

The clinic was all about the 
care and feeding 'of your class A 
virgin. This type of virgin is 
equipped with an APB-an Anti-
Penetration Bomb. Should 
penetration be attemped, the 
bomb explodes and releases 
guilt. At last report, these i.rr 
dividuals claim to have 
discovered that they can still 
enjoy each other's company 
without having sex. These claims 
are awaiting substantiation by 
medical science. However, 
because participation in the 

clinic seems to have dropped by 
spring quarter, the clinic will not 
be operational again until fall. 
Until then , casually mention to 
anyone who insists on getting 
intimate with you that you have 
"a social disease. " 

Dear Doc : Why can't KSDT 
play Good Music? Do tbey have 
to get permission from record 
companies to play their records 
00 the air? 

After searching through their 
albums, KSDT has been unable to 
find the song you have requested. 
Their albums are, for the most 
part, sent to them by the record 
companies in the hopes that the 
albums will get air play. KSDT 
welcomes its listeners to donate 
albums they want to hear to the 
station. Then volunteer as a disc 
jockey, and play them yourself .

HERE'S ONE ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITY 
YOU WON'T GET IN PRIVATE INDUlI RY. 

If you're thinking about a 
career in engineering, think 
about this. 

How many companies can 
offer you a nuclear submarine 
to operate? The answer is 
none. Equipment like this is 
available only in one place ... 
the Navy. 

The Navy operates over 
half the nuclear reactors 
in America. So our training is 
the broadest and most com-
prehensive. We start by 
giving you a year of advanced 
engineering technology. In 
graduate school. this would 
cost you thousands, but in 

the Navy, we pay you. 
Once you're commissioned 

as a Nuclear Propulsion 
Officer, you'll earn a top 
salary. Over $24,000 a year 
after four years. And you'll be 
responsible for the most 
advanced equipment 
developed by man. All the 
Navy asks in return is that 
you serve for 3 years on active 
duty upon completion of your 
training. 

You have only until May 
15th to enroll in this year's 
Navy Nuclear Propulsion 
Candidate Program. If you 

. . . 

ar majOrIng In engIne flng, 
math or physical Clences, 

NAVY OFFICER. 

contact your placement office 
to find out when a Navy 
recruiter will be on campus. 
Or call toll free, 800-841-8000 
(in Georgia, 800-342-5855) 
for more information. And if 
you're still ajunior, ask about 
the Navy's NUPOC Collegi-
ate Program, which pays you 
up to $6,000 during your 
senIOr year. 

The Navy. When it comes 
to nuclear training, no 
one can give you the same 
opportuni ties. 

IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE.
