An event invitation to a ghetto-themed party titled “Compton Cookout” has incited outrage 
among black students and supporters on 
campus, who held a Campus Black Forum 
on Tuesday night to discuss the issue. The 
forum was hosted by the Students for 
Affirmative Action Committee, a coali-
tion of diversity-minded campus groups 
including the Black Student Union. 

The party was held Monday — “in 
hopes of showing respect” to Black 
History Month — by a group of individu-
als affiliated with a number of fraternities; 
particularly, Pi Kappa Alpha. The event 
received notoriety when the Facebook 

event description was published in 
a note by Revelle College sophomore 
Elize Diop. The party called for males to 

wear “XXXL” T-shirts and 
“stunner shades,” and for 
females to dress like “ghetto 
chicks” in cheap clothing. 
Approximately 275 students 
RSVPed as “attending.”

The matter was brought 
to the attention of Chancellor 

Marye Anne Fox and Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue Monday night 
by e-mails from concerned students. Fox

UCSD Libraries are sending out surveys 
to gather student feedback, as they continue 
to slash library services 
in light of a 20 percent 
budget cut in the past 
two years alone. 

According to 
University Librarian 
Brian Schottlaender, the 
budget was reduced by 
7 percent in the 2008-
09 academic year, and 
another 14 percent last 
year, totaling a reduc-
tion of over $6 million. 
Half of these reductions 
are permanent. 

Library hours have 
been reduced by 12 per-
cent in Geisel Library 
— it now closes at mid-
night from Sunday to Thursday instead of 2 a.m. 
and closes at 6 p.m. on Friday instead of 7 p.m. 
In addition, the various libraries have cut their 
book budget by $1.2 million, and have cancelled 
almost 750 print subscriptions. 

According to Director of Library 
Communications Dolores Davies, the libraries 
will use the survey responses to create a new 
strategic plan for 2010 that includes a mission 
statement, statement of values and a prioritiza-
tion of services and operations. The old strategic 
plan, adopted in 2006, expired last year. 

“A strategic plan is basically a document that 
sets forth an organization’s mission, goals and 
strategic priorities,” Davies said.

Deejays at UCSD’s student-run 
station were dismayed Wednesday 
morning to discover intruders had 
broken into the KSDT office over-
night and stolen at least $1,700 worth 
of equipment.

The first person to notice the 
break-in was KSDT deejay Andres 
Fraire, who showed up at 7:50 a.m. 
to prepare for his 8 a.m. show, “The 
Omission.” He concluded that the 
robbery had taken place sometime 
after 2 a.m., when a program named 
“Commitment to Excellence” ended 
and its hosts went home.

“I went into the studio to start 
my show, and I noticed that every-
thing was missing. Our mixer was 
missing, our speakers _ pretty much 

everything we have at that studio 
was gone, even the microphones,” 
Fraire said. “And then I went into the 
hallway and I noticed our back door 
had been broken into, that that’s how 
the thieves had gotten in.”

According to KSDT general 
manager Meredith Wong, theft is 
not uncommon at the station.

“This is definitely not the first 
time we’ve been robbed, but this 
is the first time we’ve been broken 
into,” Wong said. “We have problems 
with our headphones being taken 
— that’s sort of what a lot of our 
operating costs go toward, is the cost 
of replacing equipment that almost 
systematically goes missing.”

Wong said the robbers probably 
jumped down 15 feet from the sec-

Scientists have discovered a 
sophisticated form of bee communica-
tion that reveals how honeybees warn 
each other of danger while foraging 
for food. 

A team of researchers led by James 
Nieh, associate professor of biology 
and head of the Nieh Bee Laboratory, 
has spent the past two years record-
ing the communicative behavior of 
honeybees. They discovered that bees 
have a specific “stop” signal used to 
alert other bees to the presence of 
danger at a food source. 

According to Nieh, this discovery 
complements the knowledge that 
worker female honeybees perform a 
“waggle dance” to alert the rest of the 
hive to the exact location of food.

“We found the anti-waggle dance,” 
Nieh said. “We discovered that bees 
actually have a stop signal for danger 
that tells other bees when not to go to 
a location to find food.”

When a bee is attacked while visit-
ing flowers to find nectar, it performs 
a “stop” signal at the site of the attack 
by pushing up its head and vibrating 
its tail — at the rate of 380 times a 
second — for a tenth of a second. 

“This is different from a general 
alarm,” Nieh said. “It happens at the 
location where the bee is attacked, and 
it doesn’t make anything new happen. 
It just alerts other bees to stop going 
there to look for food.”

These experiments were con-
ducted in a laboratory at the UCSD 
Biological Field. The bee hive was 
kept within an observational box, in 
which one glass 
panel was removed 
and replaced by 
a camera that 
recorded the various 
reactions of bees to 
different stimuli.

The bees were 
attacked by natural 
invaders, pinched 
and sprayed by 

various natural pheromones that they 
found distracting. 

“We compared the behavior before 
and after the stimuli and found that 
honeybees created this response at the 
specific food site during the presence 
of danger,” Nieh said. 

Nieh said the discovery is impor-
tant because of the implications it has 
on understanding other organisms. 

“Animals like bees and ants are 
considered superorganisms because 
the way their colony works is similar 
to a multicellular organism,” Nieh 
said. “A colony is the body, and bees 
are seen as the cells.”

Nieh said that, 
though superorgan-
isms commonly use 
positive feedback 
reactions, there are 
few examples of them 
exhibiting negative 
feedback reactions — 
which occurs when 
organisms perform an 
action to stop opera-

tions. For example, a negative feedback 
reaction occurs when the endocrine 
system signals the pancreas to stop the 
production of insulin after low blood-
sugar levels reach normal levels.

“This discovery is the most 
advanced example of negative feed-
back in a superorganism,” Nieh said. 
“I hope that other scientists consider 
this example as a type of negative 
feedback that might exist in other 
organisms.”

According to Nieh, this discovery 
could also help explain colony col-
lapse disorder, or the disappearance of 
honeybees that began in 2006.

“There’s been so much concern 
about there being less bees to pollinate 
flowers,” Nieh said. “This discovery of 
how they signal when to stop going 
to a food source could go a long way 
toward explaining that phenomena.”

The findings will be published in 
the Current Bio Journal on Feb. 23.

There are nights when an exotic 
new dish — like dosas or sashimi — 
sounds awesome, and then there are 
the nights when all you want in the 
world is a taste of Mom’s meatloaf. 
Psychologists at UCSD have been 
investigating the reasons behind 
these choices by analyzing the effects 
of positive and negative moods on 
the decision-making portion of the 
brain.

By understanding the way the 
brain reacts to outside stimuli, psy-
chologists hope to find more effec-
tive treatments for depression and 
emotional problems.

Researchers already knew that 
people tend to prefer familiar stim-
uli, because repeated exposure to 
situations or objects creates a sense 
of security and mental attachment, 
and repeated exposure to situations 
or objects will increase the affinity a 
person has toward it.

According to UCSD 
psychology professor 
and project leader Piotr 
Winkielman, research-
ers have discovered 
that familiarity 
preference 
depends 
on whether 
someone is feel-
ing happy or sad at 
the same time they are 
being exposed to the familiar 
or non-familiar stimulus.

“It contributes to a better 

understanding of our emotions, and 
that’s a good thing because we want 
to improve people’s emotional func-
tioning,” Winkielman said. “We want 
to help people feel less sad, or if 
they feel sad, we want to help them 
deal with this. It’s basically a bet-
ter understanding of how emotions 
change our judgments.”

In the one-year experiment that 
began in 2008, researchers repeat-
edly exposed UCSD student par-
ticipants to random dot patterns 
that resembled star constellations. 
Then, to put the subjects in a good 
or a bad mood, psychologists asked 
students to think of happy or sad 
memories.

With these memories in mind, 
subjects were once again exposed 
to the patterns, and their emotional 
and psychological responses were 
measured through both self-reported 
ratings and involuntary physiologi-
cal indicators of emotion. For exam-
ple, skin conductors were attached to 
the subject’s skin to detect sweat and 
facial electrodes to detected sponta-
neous frowns and smiles. 

As the researchers predicted, 
the subjects who were thinking of 

depressing 

memories demonstrated a preference 
for the familiar through a higher rate 
of involuntary smiling. 

By contrast, those who thought 
of  happy moments while viewing 
the stimuli showed a greater positive 
response to the unfamiliar, demon-
strating that those who were happy 
preferred novel things and new 
experiences to routine ones.

This helps explain a wide range 
of social situations, from a consum-
er’s decision to buy one product over 
another, to the way a person forms 
an impression of their environment 
and chooses a political candidate, to 
the understanding of how children 
develop. 

Given its extensive applications 
from marketing to political cam-
paigns to parenting, this knowledge 
of basic human psychology can give 
greater insight into our decision-
making processes.

“There’s a lot of interest in every-
day persuasion contexts, from trying 
to help people respond to products 
or political messages,” Winkielman 
said. “Also, in some clinical contexts, 
you want to understand how people 
who are depressive change their 
preferences for familiar or novel 
things or people who are manic who 
have highly positive moods — how 
they change preferences.” 

The research team, which also 
consists of graduate student Troy 

Chenier and scientists from 
the University of the 
Netherlands, will continue 
to study how emotions 
influence how humans 

think, perceive and make 
choices, as well as how these 
processes manifest in the body 
and the brain.

Researchers conclude 
that moods affect choices 
between familiar and 
unfamiliar experiences.

T he A.S. Council had a lot on its hands this week as they discussed the “Compton 
Cookout” event, which ignited racial 
tension between black students and 
the Greek community, impeachments 
and the yet-
again proposed 
revisions to the 
Loft referendum 
language.

Newly 
elected Inter-
Fraternity 
Council president Robby Naoufal 
addressed the council and read the 
official IFC statement regarding the 
racially themed event that targeted 
black students during the President’s 
Day weekend.

Members of the black community 
attended the A.S. meeting, but did not 
speak about the matter.

Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
motioned proposed a committee to 
draft an effective resolution concern-
ing campus climate.

Councilmembers debated for too 
long about the number of representa-
tives from council who would serve 
on the committee alongside the Black 
Student Union president and the IFC 
and Panhellenic presidents.

They agreed to prohibit President 
Utsav Gupta to sit on the committee 
due to fear of too much A.S. oversight. 

UCAB chair and AVP of 
Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor 
discussed the referendum he drafted 
to raise the University Centers fee to 
mirror the Consumer Price Index 
annual increase.

Taylor’s referendum passed, and 
will go to the Graduate Student 
Association Monday.

During question time, Advocate 
General Parminder Sandhu asked 
Muir Senator Ryan O’Rear why 
his three submitted resolutions for 

removing AVPs from their positions 
did not pass in committee.

O’Rear said the motions were not 
seconded.

AVP of Enterprise Operations 
Rishi Ghosh presented a resolution 

protecting the 
political free speech 
rights of UC stu-
dents, citing that a 
student’s academic 
life should not be 
subjected to these 
beliefs. This comes 

in light of the 11 student protestors 
arrested at UC Irvine after a demon-
stration against Israeli ambassador 
Michael Oren.

Councilmembers voted to pass the 
resolution.

VP of Student Life Riscie 
Hernandez and Revelle Senator 
Arvind Satyanarayan rewrote the 
language of the already-failed-in-
council referendum, and councilmem-
bers took it to discussion.

Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
voiced her support for allowing the 
students to vote on the issue. 

“I vote yes to allow them to vote 
for themselves and to keep this dream 
alive,” Hall said. 

VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch spoke in opposition, 
“Eighty percent of students who don’t 
use the Loft are subsidizing for those 
20 percent that do use it,” he said. “It’s 
not essential; it’s like going to a con-
cert venue for free.” 

After a tense council roll call vote, 
Executive Assistant Heather Lucas 
announced that the Loft referendum, 
failed again with a 13-11-2 vote.

Warren Senator Alyssa Wing 
ended the meeting on a high note, as 
she explained her idea of announc-
ing a councilmember of the week to 
“bring a warmth to this council that’s 
missing.”

It’s recently come to my atten-tion that, in the online world, only the fittest survive — 
meaning the portly wildebeests of 
the herd (me) will inevitably get 
trampled by User 12.0 and his gang 
of network-savvy junkies. 

Everyone’s favorite online dis-
traction used to be a simple blue-
and-white screen that symbolized 
the leap to college coolness — or 
so I thought. But earlier today, 

I signed onto Facebook to see a 
jungle of iPhone app-like shrub-
bery barricading the page’s unfa-
miliar borders. Whoop-dee-doo, 
the Facebook team redesigned the 
site again — fitting almost enough 
group invites, status updates and 
fan clubs in one screenshot to make 
me minimize Firefox in defeat. Now 
that I think of it, let’s not forget the 
weekly spam from hacker-happy 
predators who change our statuses 
to something like, “Kelsey Marrujo 
is … Hey friends, check out this 
sketcharific link!”

This is not what I signed up 
for. Facebook was just supposed to 
make me popular with my dorm 
crowd so I could avoid becoming 
the girl who eats a Plaza burrito by 
herself. But what snuck up on me 
— and probably many more naive 
freshmen of yesteryear — is that 
online identities became almost 
vital to our social recognition. 
(That doesn’t go for our parents’ 
generation, which should never, 
ever resort to playing Farmville … 
OK, Mom?)

As much as I hate to admit it, 
it’s true. The Internet is making us 
its bitches. Not only does it pos-
sess us to trade valuable homework 
and outdoorsy recreational time for 
a few more refreshes of our news 
feeds (cue Disney villain theme 
song: “It won’t cost much … just 
your voice!”). It also traps us in a 
world that’s kind of real, kind of fake 
— much like reality TV — forcing 
us to get to know both the Internet 
egos of our friends along with their 
everyday, slightly less glamorous 3-D 
personalities.

I’ll sacrifice myself for sake of 
example. When my roommate of 
three years and I get into one of our 
quarterly bitchfests, I’m never sure 
when it’s safe to wave the white flag 
and crawl back into our room. So 
what do I do? Sadly enough, I check 
her Facebook status to see if it has 
a negative or positive connotation. 
Something about looking forward 
to tomorrow? I’m in the clear. 
Something metaphorical about how 
she wants to rip up nearby objects? 
Time to brace myself.

Back in the day of Xanga blogs 
— don’t pretend like you don’t know 
what I’m talking about — all I had 
to do was spit some Internet slang 
(“wtf,” “lol”) and select an emoticon 
that best illustrated my mood to be a 
part of the fun.

 Now, it’s all about projecting 
a whole other image onto a tech-
hungry crowd that wants to know 
whether “It’s complicated” between 
me and Johnny, or if we’ve finally

Animals, Librarians and Barbarians, 
Pedophiles and Children, the Church 
of Fierce and Marie Antoinette, to 
name a few.

That said, how a bunch of frat 
guys — apparently bored/stoned into 
ogre-ishly poor judgment one fine 

afternoon in their 
Regents apartment 
complex — thought it 
a clever idea to plan a 
“Compton Cookout” 
in honor of Black 
History Month is 
completely lost on us. 
And, frankly, makes 
us embarrassed we 

share the same campus.
The Feb. 15 event was spread 

between several Regents condos, rec-
reating a sort of “ghetto.” Males were 
encouraged to wear “XXXL” T-shirts, 
and the Facebook invite instructed 
females: “For those of you who are 
unfamiliar with ghetto chicks-Ghetto 
chicks usually have gold teeth … 
and wear cheap clothes - they con-
sider Baby Phat to be high class and 
expensive couture. They also have 
short, nappy hair, and usually wear 
cheap weave … They look and act 
similar to Shenaynay, and speak 
very loudly, while rolling their neck, 
and waving their finger in your face. 
Ghetto chicks have a very limited 
vocabulary, and attempt to make up 
for it, by forming new words … .”

Event planners even promised 
to serve “dat Purple Drank- which 
consists of sugar, water, and the color 

purple , chicken, coolade, and of 
course Watermelon.”

In response to the event, a spon-
taneous Campus Black Forum was 
called on Tuesday. The Thurgood 
Marshall Room in Price Center was 
packed with minority students and 
faculty, along with the few A.S. and 
Greek representatives brave enough 
to weather the outrage. Even the 
likes of Associate Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Penny Rue and 
Associate Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary Ratcliff showed up.

Above all, students expressed 
hurt. Hurt that a group of boys and 
girls with no personal experience as 
a historically oppressed people would 
find it in its interests to poke fun at 
economic disadvantage. The discus-
sion led to much larger issues of racial 
misunderstanding and underrepre-
sentation on campus, and hurt, of 
course, turned to anger, trying to find 
a target, somebody to blame — some 
admissions committee member who 
held the key to accepting more black 
students, or some A.S. councilmem-
ber who could pull the plug on out-
lets of hate speech under the council’s 
jurisdiction (read: the Koala). 

This is an extreme case because 
the theme maliciously links itself to 
a month meant to represent prog-
ress, but racial-stereotype parties 
aren’t anything new; “South of the 
Border” is a popular one. It’s also 
worth mentioning that the defini-
tion of “ghetto chicks” is copy-pasted 
from UrbanDictionary.com. Aside 
from the obvious moral distaste here, 
free-speech protection laws — and 
the fact that the party wasn’t officially 
affiliated with UCSD — will 
most likely protect the perpe-
trators from harsh formal 
punishment. For reasons 
that we should be proud 
of, a bunch of kids 
throwing a question-
ably themed party do 
indeed have the “right” 

to do so.
In addition, no amount of listserv 

tsk-tsking from the chancellors or 
apologetic press releases from the 
Inter-Fraternity Council can hope to 
affect the obvious mental shortcom-
ings of the bros in question. Chances 
are, they’re racist for lack of exposure 
— not to mention a down-to-Earth 
schooling in modern-day race rela-
tions and how they’ve reformed. 
We’re all products of our situation. 
The sad fact is, a mere 2 percent of 
the UCSD student body is black; the 
idea behind this particular party was 
obviously birthed from a lifetime of 
Lil Jon videos and Dave Chapelle 
stand-up — with which the dron-
ing, hyper-academic Dimensions of 
Culture reader apparently couldn’t 
compete.

Satisfying as it would be in pain-
ful circumstances such as these, 
restricting freedom of press or creat-
ing loopholes in admissions are obvi-
ously dangerous for other reasons. 
And even if the A.S. Council balled 
up and zero-funded the Koala, or the 
administration took the legally risky 
leap of expelling the students who 
planned this party, we would have 
essentially just expelled their misun-
derstanding to the outside (and bred 
resentment in the meantime). The 
world would still be plagued by their 
shortcomings. Southern California, 
in particular, is already rife with rich 
kids who have never held a conversa-
tion with someone on the other end 
of their privileged humor.

Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
has adopted the Compton Cookout 
and its campus-climate implications 

as his latest pet project. At last 
night’s A.S. Council meet-

ing, he proposed a small 
committee of leaders 
— from the Cross-
Cultural Center, the 
IFC, the A.S. Council 
and other diversity-
centered organiza-

tions on campus — charged with 
taking “concrete” steps to mending 
racial divisions at UCSD.

But can another bickering board-
room really hope to permeate such a 
long tradition of ignorance? Plus, as 
Associate Vice President of Diversity 
Affairs Jasmine Philips put it, com-
mittee members “don’t want, like, 
thousands of people showing up.”

There is also some merit to 
Campus Black Forum proposals 
that students be required to take 
more multicultural prerequisites, 
but oftentimes the jargon and tight-
assed political correctness of diver-
sity academics doesn’t translate the 
capitalism-locked racial disadvantage 
and upper-class (mainly white) sense 
of privilege that ultimately prevents 
equality and understanding.

So we are inclined to say, at 
the risk of sounding like President 
Obama, that maybe the adminis-
tration can come in and ask the 
students who planned the event to 
simply sit down with those that were 
hurt by it (beer optional). It’s a lot 
more difficult to maintain the cocky 
devil-may-care attitude when you’ve 
got someone who does care staring 
right back at you.

Hurtful stereotyping on this cam-
pus was a problem long before the 
Compton Cookout. It’s hard to talk 
about in a way that won’t send righ-
teous free-speechers like the Koala 
into a self-important lather. They 
don’t want to sacrifice their adrena-
line rush or sense of power — or, god 
forbid, their First Amendment right 

WEB POLL 
Do you think 
the students 
responsible 
for the
Compton 
Cookout 
should be 
punished?

Anyone who has spent time at an A.S. Council meeting is familiar with the routine 
nature of the council’s weekly delib-
erations. Barring discussion of some 
particularly contentious issue (like 
racist cookouts, for instance), council 
meetings are, for the most part, free 
of controversy, consisting primarily 
of committee appointments, fund-
ing allocations, friendly chatter and 
nitpicky legislative debate — just the 
kind of thing you’d expect from your 
typical governing body. 

Occasionally, however, council-
members are faced with an issue they 
deem to be too sensitive for discus-
sion before members of the public. 
On two separate occasions this year, 
a Guardian reporter assigned to cover 
the weekly A.S. Council meeting was 
asked to leave the conference room 
after councilmembers voted to close 
their meeting to the public. Referred 
to as “Executive Sessions,” such private 
meetings are allowed under the coun-
cil’s Special Rules of Order, and usu-
ally take place when councilmembers 
wish to discuss “matters of personnel, 
existing or anticipated litigation, 
license or permit determination, 
threat to public services or facilities, 
labor negotiations, investments, con-
tracts or real property negotiations.”

Admittedly, the Guardian edito-
rial board initially thought little of 
these occurrences, due to the fact that 
such powers were within the council’s 
right. But earlier this month, mem-
bers of the Daily Nexus — UC Santa 
Barbara’s student-run newspaper — 
brought to our attention an alarming 
event that has reshaped our percep-
tion of this apparently routine council 
procedure. On Jan. 27, all members of 
the public were unexpectedly asked 
to leave a meeting of the UCSB A.S. 
Council. The meeting was closed 

for approximately 90 minutes, after 
which time councilmembers refused 
to offer any explanation for the sud-
den expulsion of reporters, students 
and other onlookers — stating only 
that the discussion revolved around 
“pending litigation.”

Assuming that their council had 
committed infractions of the Brown, 
Bagley-Keane, or Gloria Romero Open 
Meetings Acts — California state laws 
requiring legislative bodies to disclose 
basic information regarding the sub-
ject of any executive session — editors 
at the Nexus immediately launched a 
legal investigation into the situation. 
What they discovered, however, was 
that no A.S. Council at any UC cam-
pus is subject to any state-mandated 
disclosure law. Basically, the UCSB 
council’s scant description of its recent 
secretive close- door session was 
acceptable under state law.  

What this incident reveals is the 
extent to which A.S. Councils within 
the UC system are able to exploit 
their right to discretionary privacy. 
Though the student governing bod-
ies at California State University and 
California Community College cam-
puses are subject to the legal require-
ments of the Gloria Romero Open 
Meetings Act and the Brown Act, 
respectively, our own student leaders 
are inexplicably exempt from either 
law, allowing for potential abuses of 
private meetings to occur. 

That’s not to say our own council 
has regularly carried out shady deal-
ings behind closed doors. During 
both of the instances when council-
members voted to enter executive 
session this year and removed our 
reporter from their meeting, they 
provided adequate information as to 
the content of their private sessions, 

courteously adhering to California’s 
disclosure laws on a de facto basis.

As demonstrated by the actions 
of the UCSB council, however, such 
courtesy is not always exercised. The 
specific content of that Jan. 27 meet-
ing still remains a mystery — but 
probably has to do with a rowdy 
retreat whose damages were patched 
in student fees.

To ensure that such abuses of 
power are avoided in the future, 
A.S. Councils within the UC System 
should be made to adhere to state 
disclosure laws. By reserving the right 
to hide their proceedings on a whim, 
councilmembers effectively disinherit 
the most essential characteristic of any 
democratic legislative body: trans-
parency. With millions of dollars in 
student fees in their hands, it would 
be nice to know that our leaders are 
always accountable for their actions.

to be edgy pigs — to give a shit about 
the way it’s affecting those not so 
lucky to have derived the same sense 
of jaded snarkiness from life. Racial-
humor diehards argue that stereo-
types are only funny because they’re 
true. But there are different extremes; 
good racial humor is posed in a way 
that makes fun of racist people. And 
in the end, there’s just no way one 
can understand the feeling of being a 
stereotyped minority without having 
been there. Even for those minority 
students that argue they’re personally 
not bothered by the slurs — that’s 
really great for them, but their com-
fort makes no difference if others still 
feel uneasy.

The cookout’s humor is purely 
discriminatory, posed by an isolated 
social class with no real experience 
being poor or spat on by the system. 
(Admit it, PIKE — you’re over-
whelmingly white and loaded.) Even 
if planners didn’t mean it maliciously, 
there’s whole bunch of go-dumb invi-
tees snickering at their laptop screens 
— or Koala readers who misinterpret 
the satire (in the case that there is 
some) — who then think it’s OK to 
be blatantly racist. No wonder there’s 
no black students here. When the 
minority population at UCSD is dis-
gusted to the point of not wanting to 
put up with this environment, cheap 
laughs seem a large price to pay.

No racial topic or slur should be 
off-limits or hush-hush, but it should 
all be understood; the concept of 
purple drank is funny, but it’s also 
a product of a poor-stay-poorer 
national crisis. If that’s funny to you, 
you’re lucky. But at least grow the 
balls to defend your humor, face to 
face, to someone who’s not feeling it 
so much.

OPINION� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 6 

Dear Editor,
In my humble opinion, the 

UCSD administration’s outrage over 
Pi Kappa Alpha’s recent Compton 
Cookout is unwarranted. I do agree 
that such a party was a disgrace to 
the true meaning of Black History 
Month, and reflects the general 
(nonblack) populace’s dismissive, 
or perhaps even accommodating, 
attitude toward racial inequality. 
However, I believe that the adminis-
tration needs to take a step back to 
gain some perspective on the issue. 

Fraternities throwing offensive 
and obscene parties is a hallmark 
in the long legacy of college Greek 
life. Youthful rebellion has long 
included participation in culturally 
inappropriate activities, such as 
pretending to know anything about 
the “ghetto,” the real condition of 
American poverty, or the people 
who struggle every day to make 
ends meet.

Obviously, PIKE is made up of 
entitled young WASPs who just 
want to get fucked up and have fun. 
Instead of protesting some insig-
nificant fraternity’s barbecue bash, 
I believe that concerned UCSD 
administrators should focus their 
attention on real problems that 
the student body can endeavor to 
change. We, as a generation, see 
how the American political system 
is failing due to outdated biparti-
sanship. But instead of encouraging 
the student body to come together 
to protest and make real change, 
the administration has resorted to 
sending e-mails condemning inap-
propriate frat parties. Grow up, 
UCSD.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

stabilized our relationship. 
Fortunately for the world, not 

everyone has the 
time and energy to 
keep pace with every 
little revolutionary 
update. I, for one, 
have yet to succumb 
to random “Fan 
Page” invites, even 
when everyone’s 
notifications keep 
popping up to inform 
me — and the rest of 
the Facebook popula-
tion — that my RA 
from Matthews has encountered a 
lonely black sheep on his land. Well, 

good for him. Now he can brag to 
his virtual neighbors about it, kill 
one of his virtual livestock animals 

and have a virtual feast.
We signed up for 

Facebook to make 
friends in a new place, 
but instead of becom-
ing more outwardly 
social, some of us now 
rely so heavily on online 
networking that we’ve 
become nocturnal her-
mits. 

It’s cool to be a part 
of the online community, 
and I have to admit that 

being able to keep track of people 
— a Facebook-friendly euphemism 

for “stalk” — through tagged photos 
is quite a perk. But Facebook and 
its sister apps keep adding every 
possible combination of new feature 
(think 2011: Facebook’s virtual Taco 
Tuesday, complete with friends’ ava-
tars in your bar of choice) to keep 
us hooked. And it’s getting a little 
too virtual for me. I’m not saying 
I’m about to forgo my online ego 
and completely slip off the radar, 
but maybe I’ll try to skip the login 
every once in awhile and take up 
a good noseful of real-live La Jolla 
fog. Because even the most intro-
verted of UCSD nerds know how 
to enjoy a good beachside stroll 
— whether it’s “socially dead” turf 
or not.

Dear Editor, 
In response to the Feb 12. article 

“Israeli Visitor Draws Crowd,” the 
Guardian failed to report on the 
introduction that was given by Peter 
Cowhey, Dean of the UCSD School 
for International Studies and Pacific 
Relations. In it he remarked that 
what he deemed to be “disrespectful” 
questions would result in criminal 
proceedings as well as academic 
repercussions. Upon trying to find 
the section of the video where this 
was said, I found that it had been 
edited out by UCSD-TV. It is appall-
ing that UCSD-TV would cut this 
section (that had tremendous impact 
on the conduct and mood of the 
audience) from its broadcast, but it is 
far more appalling that such threats 
would be made in the first place.

This is supposed to be a univer-
sity where free speech is protected 
and encouraged. Students should 
never have to deal with the threat of 
academic repercussions as a result of 
their political activity.

I would hope that UCSD-TV 
releases the full and unedited version 
of the event as soon as possible as to 
avoid negative publicity for alleged 
censorship.

ond floor of the Student Center behind  
Hi Thai into an enclosed area that 
connects to KSDT’s back door, then 
smashed the glass to get in. 

“Part of me thinks it’s kind of funny, 
because they climbed down through 
the roof and smashed the back door 
window, and there are so many other 
windows that are more easily acces-
sible,” Wong said. “Maybe they thought 
it wouldn’t be locked from down there.”

Wong said that, though KSDT 
staff members are still attempting to 
take inventory of remaining equip-
ment, they have already confirmed that 
microphones, speakers, a mixer and a 
phone patch were stolen.

KSDT will be off the air until 
Monday, when Wong hopes to have 

assembled some old backup equipment. 
Until new equipment is purchased, dee-
jays will be unable to take phone calls 
and forced to rely on old technology.

“We have an extra deejay setup 
that’s enough to put on shows, but 
we’re going to still have to make some 
replacements,” Wong said.

The police are currently investigat-
ing the robbery. According to Wong, 
KSDT plans to increase its security 
measures to prevent similar incidents 
from reoccurring. 

 “I’m much more concerned with 
people seeing KSDT as a safe place 
than finding the criminal and serving 
justice,” Wong said.

Martin at hbiscegl@ucsd.edu.

The libraries are seeking input 
via a blog on the library Web site, 
white boards in the library lobby and 
meetings with faculty, students and 
administrators. 

Davies said that the survey is 
meant to collect feedback on how the 
library can better serve students and 
which services are most important 
to them in the face of continuing 
budget cuts.

Laura Chipps, manager of the 
information desk and periodicals at 
Geisel, said the budget cuts have affect-
ed employees across the board. 

“I’ve been here for a long time,” 
Chipps said. “I’ve seen many budget 
crises, but none as severe as this one.”

She said that 40 staff positions 
have been left unfilled or eliminated, 
although there have been no lay-
offs or resignations from the staff. 
Current employees are now respon-
sible for these job duties. 

“It’s just more stressful for us over-
all,” Chipps said. “People are start-

ing to retire, and as their places are 
vacant, the burden of responsibility 
is placed down [on] the rest of us. ”

Schottlaender said that while 
there is no way to project future 
budget cuts, the book budget and 
vacancies would be the first services 
to be evaluated.  

“Push come to shove, we’d look at 
our collections budget and see what 
we can trim from that,” he said. 

In addition, Schottlaender said that 
there are currently many staff vacan-
cies in the circulation and transaction 
areas, and that the library will look into 
consolidating these positions instead 
of hiring more employees.  

Davies said that, depending on 
the severity of budget cuts, the librar-
ies may be forced to cancel more 
journal subscriptions and further 
reduce hours of operation next year.

The libraries are collecting input 
through the end of Winter Quarter.

and Rue sent out a mass e-mail early 
Tuesday morning condemning the 
party as “a blatant disregard of our 
campus values.”

“As soon as we realized it was 
not a hoax, we worked to respond as 
quickly as possible,” Rue said.  

Students attending 
Tuesday’s forum said they 
were not directly targeting 
the fraternity, but were more 
concerned about the lack of 
awareness about diversity 
on campus. Currently, less 
than 2 percent — or 200 of 
the campus’ 22,000 under-
graduate students — is reg-
istered as black.  

According to Warren 
College junior Cierra 
McCoy, the party is only 
a symptom of the lack of 
campus diversity. She said 
that black students not 
only have low acceptance 
and yield rates, but also low 
retention rates, as many of 
them eventually want to transfer due 
to racism at the university.  

“There’s all this talk about improv-
ing student life,” McCoy said at the 
forum. “Well, this is my student life. 
I don’t give a damn if the National 
Guard has to walk me to my bio class, 
I will make them do it, and I will not 
transfer, and I will graduate.” 

Other forum attendees, such as 
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena, called for the expulsion of the 
individuals involved in planning the 
party.  

However, Rue said that it is 
unlikely that the university will take 
direct action against these students.   

“I do not believe there will be pun-
ishment as this still falls under the pro-
tection of free speech,” she said.  

She said the university would 
focus on diversity campaigns instead. 

“I believe the best way to respond 
to this type of speech is more speech, 

since it’s our collective voices that 
show the resilience of the San Diego 
community,” she said. 

Both Director of Student Life 
Emily Feinstein — who is also the 
Inter-Fraternity Council adviser — 
and Director of Student Involvement 
Emily Marx said the event was nei-

ther funded nor sponsored 
by a fraternity.   

“The only fraternity 
link this has is that some of 
the organizers were Greek-
affiliated,” IFC president 
Robby Naoufal said. “We 
can’t control the conduct 
of our members every 
moment of the day. They 
do act on their own.”  

Marx agreed.
“We found out that it is 

individuals who did this — 
that it was multiple mem-
bers of the same [apartment 
complex], and not fraterni-
ty-sponsored,” she said.

However, Feinstein said 
the university is meeting 

with the individuals involved — whose 
named have not been released — and 
that various Greek organizations will 
work with local and national chapters 
to educate them about the incident.   

 “I will do everything in my power 
to rehabilitate not just the Greeks, but 
[to] try to empower the entire com-
munity,” she said.

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund, who is also a member of the 
IFC, denied allegations, — including 
Diop’s — accusing PIKE of being a 
“white frat”.   

“That is absolutely false,” he said. 
“We pride ourselves on our diver-
sity. Whoever made the comment 
was rightly upset and emotional, but 
PIKE is not a white frat.” 

PIKE issued an official statement 
today denying association with the 
Compton Cookout and condemning 
the party.  

Students also used Tuesday’s 

forum as an opportunity to speak out 
against controversial humor newspa-
per the Koala. They cited the most 
recent issue — which ridiculed the 
Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated 
Haiti — as well as past issues that 
have repeatedly used the word “nig-
ger.”

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliff, the cookout and Koala con-
tent are both representative of preju-
dice on campus.  

“The Koala is the journalistic 
equivalent to an arsonist,” he said. ““It 
gets pleasure from the terror of others.” 

Ratcliff added that he would sup-
port withdrawing funding from the 
publication, though a recent A.S. pro-
posal to alter media guidelines was 
unsuccessful.

“For 10 years I’ve seen cycles of 
Koalas injure students,” he said. “I’ve 
worked with leaders to set up meet-
ings about this issue. A courageous 
group went to the A.S. [Council] to 
talk about it, but [the council] got 
cold feet.”    

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Diversity Affairs Jasmine Phillips said 
the university constantly marginaliz-
es minorities; for instance, by asking 
the BSU to pay for its own yield pro-
gram, which is designed to encourage 
minority students to graduate.  

“The administration expects our 
organization to [shell out] for the 
yield [program] when  it’s their prob-
lem that they should be working on 
it themselves,” she said. “We can’t just 
keep planning — something needs to 
happen.”

 In response to the recent upset, 
administrators are launching a diver-
sity campaign called “Not in Our 
Community,” and will be holding a 
teach-in on Feb. 24 from 12 p.m. 
to 2 p.m. in the Price Center East 
Ballroom.

D oe-eyed and whimsically French, Aurélia Thierrée has fallen down a rabbit hole into 
the fantasyland of 
acrobatic illusions. 
“Aurélia’s Oratorio” is 
a topsy-turvy dream-
world that would 
make Alice smile. 

In just 70 minutes, 
Thierrée trapezes over 
circus acts while still 
leveraging a Barnum 
and Bailey feel to create a kid-friendly 
spectacle. The only problem is that her 
world is cute at best. Somewhere between 
its vaudeville yore throwback and trapeze 
act, the show falls flat. It’s sort of like when 
two red splotches on a canvas look like 

nothing special, and yet, cost millions. 
Still, its foray into circus nouveau makes 
Thierrée’s abstract and practically dialogue-
void performance an amusing new way to 
look at the world. 

Irrespective of the 
show’s own merits, per-
formance is Thierrée’s 
birthright. She boasts a 
pedigree that’s hard to 
match, a punch of cred-
ibility for the show. The 
great-granddaughter 
of playwright Eugene 
O’Neil, Thierrée strays 
far from his trademark 

realism, indulging instead in a purely imag-
inative dreamscapes where clothes come 
to life. What she does inherit in “Oratorio,” 
though, is the pantomime of silent film 
pioneer Charlie Chaplin, whom she is 
privileged to call Granddaddy. 

Similarly, Thierrée’s own parents have 
left an imprint on performance history, 
and it was in their surreal world of travel-
ing circuses that she discovered her own 
calling as early as age three, touring as a 
walking suitcase entertainer. Jean-Baptiste 
Thierrée and Victoria Thierrée Chaplin 
(incidentally, the director of “Oratorio”) 
started the world-renowned Le Cirque 
Imaginaire and Le Cirque Invisible, prec-
edents for the more flamboyant Cirque du 
Soleil. 

Inspired by medieval drawings that 
depict the world upside down and inside 
out, “Oratorio” is a tightrope act that bal-
ances nonsensical images with large-scale 
dance numbers and a swiveling stage. The 
paradoxes that flood the production give 
rise to a distinct dimension where kites fly 
people, ice cream is scalding hot and feed-

True Life: 
I Seek
Revenge

In Wonderland

By Rebecca Erbe
Staff Writer

P icture this: Kim Kardashian appears on TV speaking Shakespearian. Ridiculous, right? Yet it probably wouldn’t do much 
to the very basic plotline of “Keeping Up With 
the Kardashians.” If anything, maybe you’d 
relate to the old bard a bit more. At least, that’s 
what director of this week’s Potiker Theatre 
headliner Christopher Ashley thinks.

For his newest creation, he decided to 
place his version of “The Revenger’s Tragedy” 
— a Jacobian play by Thomas Middleton — 
in the context of reality television. Maybe it 
seems implausible that the 400-year-old piece 
could be translated into a decade-old medium, 
but turns out the Italian court — with all its 
backstabbing and power play — is perfectly 
suited to reality television’s heightened egos 
and risqué affairs. Think of the engrossing 
“Tragedy” as The Real World: Bard Basics. 

And it’s just as addicting as the real thing. 
Vindice is out to avenge the death of 

his fiance, who was murdered by the Duke 
when she denied his advances. With the 
help of his brother, Hippolito, Vindice infil-

‘Me and the Devil’
Gil Scott-Heron
XL RECORDINGS

T he track throbs with distorted bass as the hero swears revenge to an uncaring sky. Politicized flows like “The Revolution Will 
Not Be Televised” might have earned Gil Scott-
Heron the title Godfather of Rap, but the twisted 
synths in blues number “Me and the Devil” 
sound more like “Sin City” than 50 Cent. His 
voice ripped apart by age and cheap whiskey, 
Scott-Heron croons over a heavy backbeat until 
the fallen hero chambers a round for his revenge 
— then it’s over. What Scott-Heron has crafted 
is genuinely disturbing, but there’s no climax to 
break the track open. You’ll have to pick up the 
album to find out how this cliffhanger ends.

‘Fearless Love’
Melissa Etheridge
ISLAND RECORDS

AChex Mix of cliche, formulaic song struc-ture and tired lyrics, Etheridge’s “Fearless Love” rides her powerful voice all the way 
to Alzheimer’s. The plodding drums and annoy-
ing synth are a humdrum throwback to Alanis 
Morissette and every other female phoenix who 
rose above her ex-boyfriend’s abuse. Needless to 
say, “Fearless Love” is a step down from the raw 
power of her “Piece of My Heart” cover and the 
honesty in breast-cancer survival anthem “I Run 
for Life.” The track was made for hardcore fans 
or people with poor pattern recognition: If every 
Nicholas Sparks story seems original to you, wait 
until you hear the lows this song goes.

Los Campesinos!

I n their latest single, Los Campesinos! draw upon their typical grab bag of instrumenta-tion to create a melting pot of unhinged 
guitar solos and energetic medleys. The ironic 
“Romance is Boring” boisterously replicates 
the entertainment of the best of the group’s 
earlier work. Irreverent and cheeky lyrics 
uncage the track’s breezy energy, stopping 
only for the occasional emphatic chorus, rau-
cus vocals juxtaposed with the banal scene 
described.

Catchy and concise, Los Campesinos! exude 
a bottomless energy, just beginning to hit their 
stride.

K itchen-sink dance bands like Errors hit you the only way they know how, 
by teasing genres into an indie 
rave potpourri. Even with 
more fingerpicked post-rock 
and mellow breakdowns than 
Holy Fuck, nothing on Come 
Down With Me will mindfreak 
you to the point of hanging 
upside-down in Times Square. 
Still: 8-Bit, ambient, noise, italo 
disco, electro — all down. 

First banger of note is “A 
Rumour in Africa,” the stut-
tering, intricate single glued 
together by a vocoder-melting 
yell that sounds like a mech-
elephant in a sexy virtual safari. 

This exotic aural cut gives way 
to the Ladytron part-deux of 
“Supertribe,” a clean, electro 
world with less outside genre 
influence, then slides into the 
minor-key minimal “Antipode”, 
an emo-teen gamer theme with 
tinges of American Football. 

After the breathy No Age 
ambience of “The Erskine 
Bridge,” shit gets heavy: 
“Jolomo” robocops back to the 
reliable electro pulse that Errors 
seems to favor, gradually add-
ing synth quirks until you’re 
sassified. Closers “The Black 
Tent” and “Beards” gobble 
more Afro-guitar licks and 
drum hits, more math-rock 

signatures, more of everything 
gourmet until you’re stuffed 
like a Bellagio buffet. 

The album reads like a 
bits-of-hits mix tape, lassoing 
subgenres until they’re bound 
together in a well-researched 

and diverse album. One word 
of advice, though: You gotta 
pick your favorite colors, dudes, 
otherwise it starts to sound like 
brown.

G iven her soulful, con-scious vocals and her ability to spit a rhyme or 
two, it’s easy to write off neo-
soul/ hip-hop artist Nneka 
Egbuna as a Lauryn Hill 
copycat, even if she’s emerg-
ing from the concrete jungle 
a decade after the misedu-
cated Fugees member made 
it big. But a couple listens to 
the Nigerian-born artist’s U.S. 
debut album Concrete Jungle 
will reveal that — at key  
moments — Nneka’s delivery 
can reach past Hill’s.

While Hill was the queen 
of versatility, perfecting soul, 
R&B, hip-hop and jazz in her 
own modern combo, Nneka 
blends these musical catego-
ries and adds a touch of her 
African roots on each track. 
Nevertheless, she manages 
the task with a lot less finesse 
than Hill. 

The album kicks off with 
one of the few tracks Nneka 
spits on — her sing-song 
fluid flow shines on “Showin’ 
Love,” topping a haunt-
ing organ production from 
fellow German musician 
DJ Farhot. From the start, 
Jungle screams lessons at us: 
“Repentance, acceptance, this 
is what I plead/ To practice 
the things we say and tell 
others in need.”

In ultra-intimate “Mind 
vs. Heart,” Nneka replicates 

the wiry pipes of Erykah 
Badu. But her voice gets 
twisted on single “The 
Uncomfortable Truth.” 
The singer’s raspy vocals 
cut through fat horns and 
a highly percussive beat 
through handclaps, shakers 
and an extremely present 
drum set.

DJ Farhot and Nneka 
fuse together effortlessly on 
breakout, “Heartbeat,” where 
a tinkering piano fades in 
atop a steady kick. Nneka 
stutters a catchy hook to the 
beat of bass drum, playing 
heartbeat to the track’s con-
templative message.

Nneka’s clearly got vocal 
chops, but she’s nowhere 
near as polished as Hill in 
her heyday. On heartfelt 
acoustic ballad “Come With 
Me,” the 28-year-old takes 
the loosely structured track 
and runs with it, flirting with 
some off-key detours along 
the way. And while her few 
smooth raps help give Jungle 
variety, they lack raw pas-
sion. 

Still, it’s not hard to see 
why Nneka is racking up fans 
in Africa and Europe. If her 
recent collaboration with 
the Roots is any indication, 
America’s about to take a trip 
down memory Hill real soon.

Nigeria’s Lauren Hill Doppleganger 
Spits Soul Over Unstable Beat

trates the Duke’s palace in disguise and 
begins wreaking havoc among the roy-
als. Adultery and murder run rampant, 
and Vindice is determined to bring the 
bloodline down, at any cost. Though the 
story reads as little more than a creative 
mash-up of Shakespearian characters 
and themes, it functions flawlessly in 
this production. With a familiar plotline, 
modern setting and language that rolls 
right off the actors’ tongues, the play is 
digestible for all. 

While each character ties the ensem-
ble together, the cast standout is third-
year masters of fine arts student Ross 
Crain, who captures both the comedy 

and repellant ego of modern celebrities 
in his role as Lussurioso, the Duke’s son. 

But the real accolades go to the 
designers of “Tragedy” which, like the 
cast, is made up entirely of UCSD stu-
dents. Seven digital video cameras are 
employed onset, in addition to those 
the television crew carries onstage. The 
footage from these cameras is displayed 
in real time on four set televisions and 
two scrim projections, allowing the audi-
ence to see the production of the play 
and consume it as a reality show. The 
camerawork is masterfully planned and 
executed, and the marriage between 
film and theater alone makes this play a 
must-see.

FILMREVIEW

By Neda Salamat
Staff Writer

I t’s post-WWII and as vets across the coun-try massage their scar tissue, U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo 
DiCaprio) is ferreted to an 
alcatraz-esdque island off 
the coast of Massachusetts 
to locate the whereabouts of 
escaped patient-murderer 
(Emily Mortimer). Partnered 
with the ever-reverent Chuck 
Aule (Mark Ruffalo), Daniels 
embarks on investigation into 
the bowels of Ashecliffe peni-
tentiary. But he also has a secondary motive: to 
find the man who murdered his wife (Michelle 

Williams) and disappeared on Shutter Island. 
Aptly nightmarish, writer Laeta Kalogridis’ 

adaptation of Dennis Lehane’s novel throws 
plot twist after plot twist into a film glittering 
with cinematography. And literature buffs will 

appreciate the ample 
foreshadowing subtly 
littered throughout the 
film. Like the psychiat-
ric treatments practiced 
on the island, the film is 
boldly unconventional 
and never fails to shock. 

Slow to start, 
“Shutter Island”’s brutal 
opening scene eviscer-

ates introduction niceties, leaving a noticeably 
ill-fit melodramatic score in its wake. The script 

is quick to recover though, as director Martin 
Scorsese’s skill shines through the dementia, 
when Daniels realizes that there is something 
peculiar occurring behind the iron-laden walls 
of Aschecliffe. Repeatedly thwarted by ever-
present head-shrink Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), 
Daniel’s lucidity falls to pieces faster than the 
hurricane-striken island that surrounds him.

Heavyweight DiCaprio once again earns his 
acting stripes as the hyper-paranoid Daniels, 
demonstrating a range of emotional complex-
ity that keeps us trembling with aftershocks 
long after the credits have rolled. Not to be 
outshone, Ruffalo and Kingsley also keep the 
blood pumping in their supporting roles. 

Demonstrating a thorough knowledge of 
Donnie Darko-type absurdity, “Island’s” graph-
ics team drenches their actors in gallons of rain 

water, burns them alive and showers them with 
petals. The gruesome and ghoulish is coupled 
with the ethereal and romantic in elaborate 
dream sequences, blurring the lines between 
sanity and madness. The violence and death, 
typified by horrific flashbacks to frozen piles 
of Holocaust corpses, while discomforting, is 
never exaggerated to the level of horror movie 
gore. 

Although “Island”’s success comes as no sur-
prise due to past hits “The Aviator” and “The 
Departed” (also DiCaprio/Scorsese works), the 
film has much more to it than the trailers sug-
gest. Like in any good Scorsese film, be ready 
to consume a heap of sociopathic characters, 
a monster of a plot twist and a sizable helping 
of East Coast drawl. Just be sure to check your 
sanity at the door.

ing babies with cigarettes in lieu of 
milk is kosher. A mouse scampers 
across the stage with a dead cat in 
tow, while Aurélia’s lullaby is the rat-
tling of alarm clocks, and roses go 
into a vase bud-down, stem-up.

“Oratorio’s” attempt at ingenu-
ity comes to the forefront in the 
most memorable of its scenes when 
Aurélia finds herself behind a lace 
curtain, made of lace herself. As if 
in Eden, she muses beneath a tree 
until a lace snake comes along and 
she loses her leg. Swiftly, she pulls 
out her knitting needles and sutures 
herself back up. Aurélia then plays 
Ann Darrow to a King Kong of lace, 
who cradles her and then dies in a 
lace blizzard in an attempt to save 
her.  

What this pastiche of juxtaposi-
tions and random tidbits amounts 
to is left ambiguous by the lack of a 
coherent storyline. The only appar-
ent motif is dancing partner Jaime 
Martinez’s reappearance as a man 

(or perhaps, a lover) in search of 
the mischievous Aurélia. In some of 
the performance’s most enchanting 
moments, Martinez bends forward 
onto the stage with Aurélia’s red 
pumps in place of gloves, danc-
ing to salsa music. Later, Martinez 
transforms into a brilliant mari-
onette puppeteer, who is dragged 
across the stage and beaten up by a 
floating coat.

Far from seamless, the magic 
tricks in “Oratorio” are, for the 
most part, readily transparent. But 
the point is not to decipher how 
the tricks are done. Thierée lets slip 
just enough for us to realize that 
there’s a ladder behind the curtain 
and, more explicitly, that there 
are dummy limbs in her opening 
act. Instead, “Oratorio” invites us 
to a make-believe world with the 
airy tunes of a Yann Tiersen-esque 
soundtrack. We don’t quite get 
caterpillars smoking hookahs and 
puffing vowels, but Thierrée’s world 
certainly is a wonderland of sorts.

▶ ORATORIO, MYVT�WHNL��

Frenchie Wows on the Trapeze
I ’m gonna be honest here and say that the request for this week’s column has been a little more 
than awkward. I don’t have anything 
to really say, since nothing’s really 
been going on in my head besides 
my personal and professional (read: 
academic) life. But, having just fin-
ished drawing 
my latest strip, 
I figure that, 
since Critical 
Hit! is essen-
tially a comic 
column these 
days, I should 
talk a little 
about my own 
comic, Sunny-Side Up, and how it 
came to be.

Sunny-Side Up is basically a boy-
meets-girl story, and it’s designed 
to be just as tumultuous as those 
meetings can typically be. It’s sort 
of pseudo-autobiographical only 
in the sense though that I, like a 
lot of other guys in this world, met 
a girl that rocked my world. I just 
happened to be one of the few that 
decided to detail those events in 
the form of a story. So, the comic is 
essentially my series of unfortunate 
events, because they’re the only ones 
I’m familiar with.

From the get-go, the story was 
never really designed to be very 
happy. Like life, it’s supposed to 
be bittersweet. The arc that it’s in 
right now was where I’ve always 
wanted the story to end up when 
I first started writing it, as it was 
the only thing I could ever think 
about. I admit that the point was to 
be unabashedly self-pitying. I mean, 
the way I saw it, I didn’t want to be 
held back by rejection and embar-
rassment forever, and I figured the 
best way I could ever get over it was 
by publicizing it. Hence, the birth of 
the comic.

Here’s the thing: whether any 
of us would like to admit it or not, 
we all want to feel significant. We 
all have something to say, and 
we’re always looking for ways to be 
heard. I’m no different. I had just 
been stripped of my dignity, and, 
dammit, I wanted someone to fuck-

ing listen to 
me. I wanted to 
bitch and moan 
— I wanted to 
be pitied. But 
since everyone 
has their own 
problems to 
worry about, 
nobody really 

gives a shit. Not even friends. So 
what’s a guy to do? Obviously, make 
everyone else care.

Fiction, I’ve come to realize, is 
basically one of the many ways of 
making a lot people care about trivi-
al shit, mostly personal. I’ve learned 
that, if you make your problems 
sound interesting enough, chances 
are, people are going to listen. So 
the tricky thing about fictionalizing 
my own personal events was trying 
to make them interesting. You can’t 
just start with the drama — that’s 
stupid. You have to ease into it. You 
gotta make the people care about 
your characters first. Then, as soon 
as they’re getting cozy with them, 
you start taking it up a notch. Once 
you have them in a good place, 
BANG! You kick ’em in the ass with 
the dramatic tension. It’s what I did 
with the comic.

I started writing the story Winter 
Quarter of last year; I decided that I 
was gonna end it Spring Quarter of 
this year. This gave me five quarters 
to tell the story. I spent the first two 
quarters trying to get people inter-
ested in the characters or, at least, to 
give people a reason to look forward 
to it every week. I mean, I under-

stand that there are some consistent 
readers in the school, so I figured 
the continuity of the story would 
be their little treat. Once the third 
quarter rolled around, Fall Quarter 
of this year, that’s when I started 
cranking it up a notch. I got it to be 
super sentimental.

The point of the overt sentimen-
tality was to exaggerate the emo-
tions. If the emotions were exagger-
ated enough, then the drop would 
feel just as significant. That’s the 
idea, anyways. I wanted people to 
feel that uneasy, cutesy feeling that 
they so despise so that, when it’s at 
its most dispicable, I can fuck it up 
and really make people care. The 
goal was for people to pity these 
characters.

That’s about what’s happen-
ing now. Or supposed to be, any-
ways. To be honest, I’m significantly 
less angsty than I was a year ago, 
and, actually, sorta resent drawing 
it. The only reason I still do it is to 
prove that I can commit to some-
thing. I mean, I still think it’s kinda 
cool. But I’d really like to be done 
with it and move on. I dunno, my 
opinions on it are up in the air.

I will say, though, that the comic 
is supposed to be hopeful. I mean, 
it’s not so obvious now, since it’s at 
a very shitty place, but it was never 
supposed to be just bitter. Like 
the title, it’s supposed to be very 
“Look on the bright side.” It still 
has a quarter and a half to go, and, 
in that span, I want both those 
characters to come out of it being 
very different people. For better or 
worse. That’s sorta how it is in real 
life anyways, so why shouldn’t my 
cutesy, fictional characters be any 
different?

I have nothing more to say. If 
you want to follow along with the 
story, you can catch the comic in its 
entirety at www.PHRHIEDOM.com.

FILMREVIEW

By Rebecca Erbe
Staff Writer

P aul Bettany is currently all up in the box office — he’s starring in two films at the moment. 
Chances are, 
you’ve only 
heard of 
“Legion,” and 
that’s beyond 
unfortunate. 
“Legion,” his 
big-budget apoc-
alyptic-angels 
flick, has turned 
out to be an 
underwhelming bust, but “Creation” 
— an ode to Charles Darwin — is 
drawing a small, but intrigued, audi-
ence.

Truthfully, “Creation” definitely 
isn’t for everyone. Bettany stars as 
British naturalist Darwin, but this isn’t 
the young explorer setting out for the 
Galapagos you learned about in biol-
ogy, nor the grandfatherly figure pre-

siding over modern science. Bettany’s 
plays the Darwin that evolved from 
one to the other in the intermedi-
ate 20-plus years between his HMS 
Beagle excursion and the release of 
On the Origin of Species. 

This Darwin 
is fraught with 
both anxiety 
about the death 
of his eldest 
daughter and 
how his theory 
will alter the 
world. He is 
constantly con-
cerned that his 

deeply religious wife will be destroyed 
when he releases his findings and 
“kills god.”

Eventually, Darwin’s research turns 
against him as he blames himself 
for his daughter’s death: She was the 
genetically weak product of a union 
between first cousins. By the end of 
“Creation,” our brilliant evolutionary 
pioneer is mad with grief, talking to 

ghosts and refusing to work at all. 
Bettany plays his role with humble 

perfection. While the pace of the film 
is decidedly slow and pastoral, he 
brings a quiet intensity to each scene 
as a man broken by his own intel-
lect. Even notoriously stony Jennifer 
Connelly, Bettany’s on- and offscreen 
wife, shines as the tightlipped and 
pious Mrs. Darwin. 

An intimate look into the reclusive 
existence of a legendary figure in the 
scientific world, the story is told with 
surprising alacrity and intelligence, 
continuously reminding us that 
Darwin’s ideas transformed society’s 
concept of religion. 

Historical drama is a genre that 
often struggles to find an audience, 
with the exception of epic money 
holes like “Titanic” and “Gladiator.” 
But if you have the attention span to 
follow a film without explosions or 
gratuitous nudity, then you can do 
no better than “Creation.” This film’s 
subtle majesty will satisfy most well-
trained palates.

crippled their early season potential 
in the past. Maybe a little zen and 
spring sunshine is all CC and Captain 
Jeter need to remain world champs.

2. The Dodger divorce court.
I sure as hell don’t envy the PR 

guy who has to sit down all those 
diehard Dodger fans and explain why 
Mommy and Daddy are getting a 
divorce. This winter, Dodgers owner 
Frank McCourt and his wife Jamie 
went through a very public divorce. 
The clincher? Jamie also happens 
to be the team’s CEO. As a result, 
Dodgers’ ownership was neck-deep 
in litigation, ignoring the team’s glar-
ing need: improving its mediocre 
pitching staff. All the Dodgers needed 
was a solid offseason to seriously 
contend for the NL pennant. Instead, 
LA enters spring training with zero 
upgrades and a sad farewell from its 
2009 ace pitcher. I wonder if McCourt 
will have to pay alimony to help keep 
Manny in a clean pair of diapers.

3. The Cuban capitalist.
The biggest headliner out of 

Cuba since Elian Gonzalez is Aroldis 

Chapman, the left-handed defector 
with a 100-mph fastball. Chapman 
left his native country over the 
summer and established residency 
in the income tax-friendly nation 
of Andorra before inking a $30.25 
million, six-year contract with the 
Cincinnati Reds in January.

The 22-year-old Cuban phenom 
has the chance to boost a rotation that 
also features the young and promising 
Homer Bailey, Edinson Volquez and 
Johnny Cueto — making Cincinnati 
a possible sleeper pick in the NL East. 

4. MLB ain’t recession-proof.
More so than in any spring 

training prior, this year, there are 
numerous All-Stars out of work and 
searching for a job. Normally, each 
spring has a few over-the-hill play-
ers or aging stars who wait until the 
middle of spring to sign with a new 
team, but this year’s AARP strag-
glers include players in their prime 
who are coming off solid seasons. 
Although Johnny Damon can keep 
blaming his unemployment on Scott 
Boras’ insanity, the fact that he is 
still without a team would have been 

unthinkable even just three months 
ago. Other players waiting in the 
bread line include Jarrod Washburn, 
Felipe Lopez, Russell Branyan and 
Jermaine Dye.

5. The return of the Mac.
In spite of what might be the 

world’s most pathetic steroids apol-
ogy, Mark McGwire now returns to 
the major league as the St. Louis 
Cardinals’ new hitting coach. 
Cardinals skipper Tony La Russa 
brought his old Oakland bash broth-
er into the clubhouse to mentor a 
group of talented young hitters and 
to oversee an offense that includes the 
otherworldly powers of Albert Pujols 
and Matt Holliday. 

The real question is if La Russa 
will keep McGwire on the active ros-
ter to use as a pinch hitter. It’s very 
unlikely, but weirder things have hap-
pened — like the steroids-era poster-
boy returning as a hitting coach. 

I must be maturing as a sports 
writer; I just wrote a whole column 
on baseball without once mentioning 
my home team, the San Francisco 
Giants. Oops.

ing seven shutout innings, allowing 
four hits, no walks and striking out 
four batters. The win was Rossman’s 
first of the season.

On Saturday, Gregorich was one of 
UCSD’s many offensive contributors, 
going 5-6 with seven RBIs and five 
runs scored. Saul hit for the cycle in 
both games combined.

The first game featured 18 hits, 
with six players collecting multiple 
hits: Saul, Gregorich, Kehoe, junior 
catcher Michael Benton and sopho-
more outfielder Danny Susdorf all 
contributed as multiple-hitters. 
Leading 6-1 through six innings, the 
Tritons broke the game open with 
an eight-run seventh inning. UCSD 
cruised to a 15-2 win and set the tone 
for the day. 

In the second game of the double-
header — and the final in the series 
— Saul opened up the route by hit-
ting a home run in the first inning. 
Gregorich singled and stole second 
base as Kehoe batted him in, putting 
UCSD up 2-0 in the first inning. 

Senior right-hander Kirby St. John 
tossed four shutout innings, allowing 
just two hits on four strikeouts. 

In the second inning, Albitz 
smacked a two-RBI single to center-
field, giving the Tritons a 4-0 lead. 
UCSD then loaded the bases, and 
Gregorich promptly cleared them for 
a three-RBI double to centerfield, giv-
ing the Tritons a 7-0 lead. UCSD 
never looked back, and ended the 

game with a 16-0 win. 
“We are preparing this week like 

we do every week of the season,” 
Saul said. “Our focus does not change 
depending on who we play, and I 
believe this is one of our strengths as 
a team.”

The Tritons open up conference 
play this week against No. 23 Chico 
State. According to Kehoe, he will 
maintain a high performance stan-
dard at practice this week.

“As a team, our practices are always 
intense and very productive, and we 
pride ourselves on showing up every 
day and getting better,” Kehoe said. 
“Obviously, we have been doing a lot 
of things right, but as a team, we pride 
ourselves on getting better every day. 

We are preparing for Chico just like 
we prepare for any other series. We 
know it’s our first conference series, 
so it’s obviously a meaningful series — 
but we aren’t changing the way we go 
about anything. We just need to keep 
playing our game.”

UCSD hopes to play off their 
momentum as they head into confer-
ence. They will first host the Wildcats, 
who are 4-0 overall and 4-0 in CCAA 
action, and who swept Cal State East 
Bay last week to begin their confer-
ence play. The four-game set begins 
on Friday, with first pitch scheduled 
for 2 p.m. at Triton Baseball Field.

SPORTS� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

drive.”
The next two games served as the 

comeback UCSD needed.
Gaito’s complete game shutout 

on Saturday led the Tritons to vic-
tory. UCSD tallied a run in the first 
inning and tacked on three more in 
the sixth to claim its first 
win of the four-game 
series. 

Junior infielder 
Katrin Gabriel ripped 
a single and stole third 
on Eliades’ sacrifice 
bunt. Gabriel would 
later reach home to give 
UCSD a 1-0 lead in the 
first inning. De Fazio’s 
two-run double down 
the left field line gave 
the Tritons three insur-
ance runs to ensure a 
win, while Chico was 
unable to make any sort 
of comeback in the sev-
enth inning. 

After pitcher’s duels 
in the first and third 
games in the series, 
offense starred in the 
final meeting, as UCSD 
edged the Wildcats out 
10-9.  

UCSD lost momentum in the 
first inning but regained control in 
the bottom of the second. Chico put 
three runs on the scoreboard in both 
the first and second innings. 

The Tritons responded in the bot-
tom half of the second inning, send-
ing seven players across home to 
take the lead 7-6. Lesovsky, Eliades 
and De Fazio scored the final three 
runs in the second inning off a Saari 
double to the left center. 

“Our bats came alive today,” 
junior infielder Sarah Woofter said.  
“It shows that our team is full of fire 

and heart, even if we are down 0-6.” 
Chico State took the lead back 

with three runs in the top half of the 
third inning but couldn’t score the 
rest of the way. 

After the first two Triton pitch-
ers struggled to halt the Wildcat 
offensive onslaught, Gaito took the 

mound and retired 16 
of the 19 batters she 
faced, striking out four 
and allowing only three 
hits.

Trailing 9-8 in the 
bottom of the sixth, a 
double by All-American 
Lesovsky over the cen-
terfielder, a sacrifice 
bunt by Saari and a 
single by Spangler gave 
UCSD the run needed 
to tie the game at 9-9. 
Freshman infielder 
Dyanna Imoto pinch-
ran for Spangler — with 
a grounder from Haley 
— scored the winning 
run for UCSD, 10-9. 

“We have the fight 
and heart to show that 
we want to win since it 
could have been a long 
game, but in the end it 

was going in our favor,” Gerckens 
said. “As a team, we need to play 
harder — with better defense — and 
execute more to make more consis-
tent runs.”

UCSD’s two wins handed Chico 
State its first two losses of the season, 
making them 4-2 over all, and 2-2 in 
the conference.

The women will look to keep the 
ball rolling, and make improvements 
before their next two games against 
Cal State Bernardino on Feb. 17.

ychow@ucsd.edu.

Later that day, at 3:30 p.m., the 
players’ momentum was halted 
when they were narrowly defeated 
4-5 by regional rival: the No. 27  
Brigham Young University, Hawaii.

However, the Tritons proved a 
stern test for the Seasiders, and held 
their own against the favored oppo-
sition. The teams split the singles 
matches, each side winning three. 

Headlining the singles results 
for UCSD was No. 1 player Erik 
Elliot’s thrilling three-set victory 
over Brigham Young’s No. 1  — and 
No. 10 in the country — Rong Ma.

In the end, the Seasiders man-
aged to take two of the three doubles 
contests to earn the victory.

However, the competitive nature 
of the match was a major improve-
ment from the previous meeting 
between the two teams, and Nguyen 
said the loss still boosted the team’s 
confidence.

“Last year, we lost to them 7-2,” 
Nguyen said. “This year, we played 
them 4-5. They are ranked No. 2 in 
our region, and we were right there 
with them. That gave us confidence 
for the rest of the tournament.”

Despite the hiccup against 
Brigham Young, the Tritons main-
tained an energetic spirit over the 
next two days, scoring decisive vic-
tories that included a 7-2 demolition 
of Western New Mexico University 
on Feb. 13 and an 8-1 drubbing of 
Montana State University, Billings 
the following day.

Against Western New Mexico, 
Elliot continued his impressive run 
at No. 1 in singles, following up 
his success against Brigham Young’s 
Ma with a straight set 6-4, 6-4 win 
over No. 24 junior Yair Banuelos. 
Also contributing singles victories 
was Nguyen, who improved his sea-
son record 4-0 with a 6-2, 6-0 win 
over Western New Mexico’s No. 4 
Francisco Damasio.

On Feb. 14, after dispatching 
Montana State by sweeping the dou-
bles contests and taking five of six 
singles matchups, the Tritons faced 
their sternest test of the weekend: a 
showdown with No. 25 Midwestern 
State University.

After a grueling string of four 
matches in three days, the Tritons 
displayed exemplary fitness and 
depth of skill, upsetting the Mustangs 
on the back end of a doubleheader.

The Tritons won two of three 
doubles matches against their 
favored opponents, receiving victo-
ries at No. 1 doubles from No. 17 
junior Armaum Emami and red-
shirt freshman Austin West, and at 
the No. 2 spot from Elliot and sopho-
more Jake Fellow.

In singles, No. 1 Elliot finished 
the tournament undefeated with his 
straight set victory, and wins at spots 
two through six from Nguyen — 
along with sophomores Sam Ling 
and Naveen Dixit — propelled the 
Tritons to a comfortable 6-3 win.

“It was important to come out 
strong from this tournament” 

Nguyen said. “It was huge to beat the 
No. 25-ranked team, after losing to 
No. 27. It gave us a huge amount of 
confidence to beat them, and was a 
nice highlight for the season.”

Steidlmayer says that beating 
ranked opposition is something the 
Tritons will need to get used to if 
they are to achieve success in the 
postseason.

“We need to continue to have con-
fidence that we can be a Top-20 team,” 
he said. “I think this is a Top-20 team 
at least, and with a little bit more, we 
can definitely be Top 10. It’s important 
that our guys believe that.”

The team looks to continue its 
success story on the road against 
Azusa Pacific University on Friday, 
Feb. 19 — a match that was supposed 
to have been played on Feb. 6, but 
was rained out.

“We are going to practice, get 
some rest and look to take some 
momentum going forward,” Nguyen 
said.

MEN’S TENNIS — The No. 35 UCSD 
men’s team arrived in Phoenix, Ariz., 
on Feb. 12 for the three-day Paseo 
Tournament — hosted by Grand 
Canyon University— in search of 
a winning formula. Consecutive 
season-opening losses to the 
University of San Diego on Jan. 
30 and Concordia University two 
days later had the team in search of 
answers.

Three days in Arizona and five 
matches later, they seemed to have 
found some.

“We had a rough start,” junior 
captain Vince Nguyen said. “We 
went back to train, worked a lot on 
doubles and felt pretty confident 
coming in.”

On the Paseo Racquet Center 
courts, the Triton men translated 
confidence into results, upsetting 
higher-ranked Midwestern State en 
route to posting a 4-1 record — 
all over a rigorous weekend that 
squeezed five matches into three 
days.

“It’s good to get a lot of matches,” 
head coach Eric Steidlmayer said. 
“That’s something this group needs. 
We need the experience of playing 
this much.”

At 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 12, the 
Triton players opened up the tour-
nament in style, pummeling hosts 
Grand Canyon 8-1. Seven of the 
team’s wins were in straight sets. 
Nguyen said a positive attitude and 
team camaraderie were instrumen-
tal to their success.

“We all felt great out there,” 
Nguyen said. “We competed hard 
from the beginning. Everyone was 
cheering each other on — yelling at 
each other every single point. It was 
very positive out there.”

The men’s tennis team 
tallied its first wins 
of the year, toppling 
ranked opposition at 
the Paseo Tournament.

BASEBALL — Living up to their No. 
3 national ranking, the UCSD base-
ball team swept a four-game series 
against Grand Canyon University 
from Friday, Feb. 12 to Saturday, Feb. 
13.

The Tritons dominated GCU both 
days, outscoring them 52-4 in the 
series. Three of the four games fea-
tured 15 or more runs from UCSD, 
yielding final scores of 6-0, 16-2, 15-2 
and 15-0 and improving their overall 
record to 9-1. GCU fell to 3-5 overall. 

The Tritons began the series with 
a Friday doubleheader, junior righty 
Tim Shibuya taking the mound in 
game one and shutting it down. 
Shibuya hurled seven shutout innings, 
allowing just three hits on eight strike-
outs. The Wyoming native improved 
his earned run average to 2.65, and is 
now 3-0 on the season.

Three GCU errors were all UCSD 
needed on offense, as the Tritons 
scored five unearned runs in the fifth 

inning. 
“During the GCU sweep, the 

entire team was clicking in all areas,” 
junior outfielder Kyle Saul said. “Our 
pitchers only gave up four runs, and 
consistently pounded the ball down in 
the zone. Our offense put up 52 runs, 
and was relentless in our approach of 
driving the ball to right center field. 
As an offense unit, we wore down 
their pitching staff.”

Junior designated hitter Aaron 
Bauman went 2-4 with two runs batted 
in in the first game, while junior third 
baseman Evan Kehoe collected three 
hits. Senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich — who was named the 
Wilson/California Collegiate Athletic 
Association player of the week after 
going 11-for-16 with 16 RBIs and two 
home runs against GCU — added two 
hits of his own. 

The Tritons scored three unearned 
runs in the fifth inning as Bauman 
and Gregorich hit back-to-back 
doubles with two outs. Kehoe then 
stepped up to the plate and continued 
the two-out rally, whacking a single to 

put UCSD up 5-0. The Tritons cruised 
to a 6-0 win under the arm of Shibuya. 

“We played very well throughout 
the whole series,” Kehoe said. “Our 
hitters did a great job with their plan 
at the plate — driving the ball the 
other way — and this helped us put 
up a lot of runs. The pitchers also did 
an excellent job pounding the zone 
and challenging their hitters. It was an 
all-around great series for the team.”

In the second game of the dou-
bleheader, UCSD exploded with 15 
hits and 16 runs, putting up three 
four-run innings. Junior right-hander 
Daniel Simmons improved his record 
to 2-0, going 4.1 innings and allow-
ing four walks, five strikeouts and 
only one earned run for two hits. The 
UCSD bullpen shut out GCU in the 
last half of the game. 

UCSD was trailing 1-2 in the third 
inning before Bauman blasted a two-
run shot to put the Tritons up 3-2. 
Saul, senior shortstop Vance Abitz 
and senior outfielder Robert Sedin 
each made two hits apiece. 

The Tritons scored four runs in 

the third inning, four in the fourth, 
four in the fifth and three in the sixth 
to pull away with a 16-2 victory.

After winning the first two games 
of the series, the Tritons aimed for 

the same results in Saturday’s dou-
bleheader. Senior right-hander Matt 
Rossman started the first game pitch-

ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL
By Yvonne Chow� Staff Writer

UCSD’s softball team rebounded with back-to-back wins against Chico State after losing the first two games of a four-game series on 
Feb. 12 to Feb. 13. The Tritons hosted the Wildcats 
on their new field at RIMAC Arena, where they 
evened their record to 3-3 overall and 2-2 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association.

According to head coach Patti Gerckens, the 
team set the right tone for the rest of the season 
and overcame weak spots in both their defense and 
offense.

“It’s important that we don’t want to fall behind 
early on in the season,” Gerckens said. “These two 
wins help us stay very competitive.” 

In the first game, on Friday, UCSD’s offense 
struggled to push through any runs: Chico’s start-
ing pitcher Kacie McCarthy pitched a complete 2-0 
shutout. After allowing a run in the first inning, 
sophomore pitcher Camille Gaito pitched five shut-

out innings before giving up an insurance run to 
Chico in the final inning. 

UCSD fared no better in the second game of the 
series, coming up short 6-7 despite a fierce rally in 
the seventh inning. The Tritons battled back from 
a 0-7 hole in the fourth with two runs in the fifth, 
thanks to consecutive hits by senior shortstop Mandi 
Eliades, junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky and senior 
catcher and team captain Nicole Saari. 

Silenced in the sixth inning, UCSD’s bats heated 
up again as the Tritons loaded the bases. Hits from 
sophomore outfielder Kellin Haley, Saari, junior 
infielder Jennifer De Fazio and freshman infielder 
Nicole Spangler drove home four runs, but a ground-
out ended the rally with UCSD down one run. 

Saari said Friday’s losses reminded the team to 
not take any opponent lightly — even one consid-
ered to be an easy win.

“It was a bad showing of our abilities, but our 
comeback shows we never give up,” Saari said. “We 
just need to come out more focused, and see every 
team as important to give us that extra competitive

Now that the excitement from the New Orleans Saints’ Super Bowl victory is rapidly 
fading (just in time for Mardi Gras) 
and global warming is doing its best 
to melt the Vancouver Olympic games 
into a snow-free event, there are slim 
pickings in the sporting world.

The World Cup is still months 
away, no new Tiger Woods playmate 
has stepped forward for her 15 min-
utes and I’m frankly not very interest-
ed in Gilbert Arenas’ new basketball-
weapons venture (the NRA-NBA). 

So, as pitchers and catchers report 
to camp this week for the beginning 
of spring training, I happily welcome 
the official start of the 2010 Major 

League Baseball season. Whether 
players spent their vacation time 
hibernating in million-dollar homes 
or toiling in the Dominican winter 
leagues, over the next two weeks, they 
will all convene at their training com-
plexes in Arizona and Florida to play 
some long toss and take a few rounds 
of batting practice — as Opening Day 
2010 inches closer and closer.

Here are five stories to follow as 
spring training begins. Pour yourself 
a tall glass of grapefruit juice and find 
some shade behind a cactus, because 
baseball’s back.

1. Can the Yankees stay drama-
free?

New York followed its World 
Series Championship with a very un-
Yankee offseason: lowering the team 
payroll, and passing on the mar-
ket’s marquee-free agents for Curtis 
Granderson and Javier Vázquez — 
incredibly solid players without much 
flash. In the last decade, the Yankees 
have made dramatic and headline-
filling offseasons a habit, which have 
always added to New York’s tradi-
tionally contentious spring trainings 
— and George Steinbrenner’s hernia 
collection. But this spring, the boys 
in pinstripes roll into Florida with-
out any of the distractions that have
