D EPENDING on whs:> you talk to, it is either one of the more serious 
academic problems facing UCSD, 
or an interesting, but none too 
pressing, issue . Either way, the 
Literature/Writing program is a 
multi-faceted subject. 

For some, the interest in the 
program began last year when 
the administration told the 
literature depanment it was 
upholding a judgment made by 
Dr. Harold Ticho, Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs, 
which stated that assistant 
directors of campus writing \ 
erograms (each college has its 
own freshman writing program) 
could no longer teach a course 
in the literature depanment and 
still receive payment from the 
writing program for the 
additional services. 

"They had been essentially 
teaching for us for free ," said Dr. 
Michael Davidson , Associate 
Professor of Literature. "So we 
were able to get four courses a 
year Out of them. and now, all of 
a sudden, we had to find money 
to pay them." 

Davidson , who said he is 
concerned about the future and 
continued expansion of the 
literature depanment, said the 
depanment's fixed budget made 
it impoSSible to find that money, 
so four courses, "especially in the 
very popular fiction courses," 
had to be cut back, giving the 
illusion that cutbacks were in 
effect. 

Dr. Stanley Chodorow, Dean of 
Arts and Humanities, said that 

/ the edict issued by Ticho isn't 
./ really a cause for concern among 

. students or academia since it 
was a purely logical step. 

-It's not a dispute over 
whether these people should 
teach, or even whether they have 
time to reach. but who should 

pay them?" Chodorowexplained. 
"Where (should) the funds come 
from? Who's responsible?" 

Ticho agreed chat the order to-
the literature depanment and 
writing programs was not 
intended with any malice , but 
was simply a case of whether the 
assistant directors teaching in 
the literature department were 
doing ·the full-time job they were 
aSSigned to do. 

Ticho, who said he didn't 
remember the details of the case, 
said that a person is hired to do 
one job and that's all that should 
be expected and explained that 
resources are placed in one area 
and not in another. 

Davidson , however, said he is 
worried that the administration 
simply does not want to suppon 
the literature depanment. 

"I must say the climate does 
not seem real condUCive to 
funding the humanities in 
general ," Davidson said. He said 
that there IS an obvious 
presupposition that students 
attend UCSD for science-
oriented courses and the fact 
that more students come for 
sciences than humanities may be 
a determining factor in the 
suppon the literature department 
receives from the administration. 

"1 think that if you were to 
look at enrollment figures and 
support to the university, you'd 
find out that the bulk of the 
students who come to UCSD 
come for the sciences," Davidson 
said . 

"They are the programs where 
the faculty-student ratio is the 
greatest. So on paper, it looks 
obvious ... if you're going to put ' 
money behind new positions, 
you're going to put them behind 
the engineering program, which "

New UC system 
increases enrollment 

Student enrollment at the 
University of California's mne 
campuses has reached a record 
level for the sixth straight year, 
according to figures compiled by 
the Office of the President. 

UCSD student 
sexually assaulted 

By MAITHEW lAlT, News Eduor 

A 20 year old female UCSD student \'.'as sexually assaulted on La Jolla Shores Drive at 8:15 Monday night, a poltce offical said . 
The victim was walking back to campus after her car had broken 

down when a white male, approximately 20-25 years old , came up 
from behind . grabbed her, pushed her down a small embankment 
to a wooded area and proceded to assault her. 

"The suspect did not rape her nor did he attempt to," Sergeant 
Robert Jones of the Campus Police said . "This was a cnme called 
sexual battery. 

"Sexual battery occurs when one touches the intimate parts of 
another against that person's will . Until two years ago this type of 
cnme was JUSt a battery ," Jones said . The maximum prison term for 
sexual battery is four years. 

ThiS \'.'as the eighth reported sexual battery crime in the past 12 
years. Also , In the last 12 years there have been eight reported rapes 
and eight reported attempted rapes. 

"Relative to other campuses these numbers are good, but any 
cri me like this is abhorrent and demoralizing, " Jones said . 

The victim \'.'as physically unharmed . 
The suspect was approximately 5'8" with brown hair, a medium-

Sized build , and wearing a white T-shirt , gray sweatpants, and 
white Nike hi!;l-ttops. ' 

Any Information regarding this incident should be directed to 
Detective Zimmer at 534-4359. 1m 

There arc 152,167 
undergraduate and graduate 
students attending classes this 
fall, up from 147,957 students in 
fall 1985. The Increase of 4,210 
students represents almost a 3 
per em mcrease, shghtly higher 
th an the 2.5 percent in rcase 
recorded last year. 

Campuses howing the biggest 
increases thiS year In rhe number 
of new entering students were 
Irvine , San Diego, Santa Barbara 
and anta Cruz . Three of the 
campuses, Berkeley, Davis and 
an Francisco, showed .slight 

declines. The dechnes reflected 
the intem to keep admissions to 
a level that facilttie and stalTing 
could accommodate . according 
to UC Director of admissions 
and Outreach Ed Apodaca. 

Apodaca said several factors 
may have contributed to this 
year's record figures at the 
undergraduate level , including 
increased retention rates and a 
new admissions system which 
allowed students for the first 
time to apply simultaneously to 
more than one campus. 

Apodaca listed the fees for 
attending a UC campus average 
about $1,300 a year compared to 
the $10,000 to $15,000 annual 
tuiuon of comparable pri\'ate 
institutions. A fact that he feels is 
a factor in students' decisions to 
attend the U niversity. 

Upward Bound

The office of the federally 
funded Upv.-ard Bound program , 
whose purpose is to increase the 
numbers of 
minOrity/ disadvantaged high

Dr. Burne and Dave Carrel work to make nuclear rest rnonilOnng poSSIble 
possible. 

UCSD scientists 
Ineet with Russians 
By PAT SCHROEDER 

LAST week UCSD scientists, including Dr.Jonathan Brune and research technician Dave Carrel, met with five Russian SCientists to determine three U.S. sites for the American-
Russian eismic Momtoring Network. 

Brune and Carrel are attempting to demonstrate that nuclear 
testing can be seismically and accurately verifiable. Carrel said, 
"The purpose of our project is to create a model venfication scheme 
to prove that nuclear testing can be regulated and modified." 

Regarding politics, Brune said , "Our purpose is also to show that 
we are able to communicate with the Russians, and that they are 
willing to work with us." 

Brune and Carrel had to work freely with the Russians. They had 
to replace Russia's seismic monitors with advance technological 
monitors. 

Only new and advanced seismic monitors can accurately verify a 
nuclear explosion . A year ago, Russian monitors could not 
determine the difference between a half-kiliton nuclear bomb and 
an earthquake . 

"They have dilferent systems than ours. They are used to working 
\vith analog systems, not digital systems. Theyrecord everything on 
paper and cannot analyze data immediately or effectively. Some 
scientists still use slide-rulers," Carrel said. 

Last year Brune and Carrel made it possible for the Russians to 
accurately monitor and verify nuclear testings. Brune and Carrel 
installed three seismic monitors near Semipalatinsk , a Russian 
nuclear test site .

is going to increase nOl only 
your enrollment, but it's also 
going to increase your financial 
suppOrt from grants and funding 
agencies outside." 

Dr. Charles Cooper, head of 
the writing programs , however, 
disagreed that support is low for 
the writing programs and said 
that he is happy to see funding 
going to sciences and medicine. 
Cooper said that the problem 
may lie with the public's 
perception of what UCSD stands 
for. 

"The writing major is the 
second biggest program in the 
depallment, and many of liS who 
work in it have always thought 
that it should have much better 

SUpport," Cooper said. "This is 
an ongoing problem for many 
years - struggling to get decent 
support, adequate suppOrt for a 
major program in the 
humanities ." 

.... 

Though enrollment in the 
writing major has increased by 
about 300 percent since it \'.'as 
introduced in 1978 (enrollment 
in Fall 1978 \'.'as 96; it currently 
stands at 340), Cooper said there 
is still not enough awareness of 
the program and its quality. 

"Even'San Dieg:ms think of 
UCSD as a science and 
technology campus," said 
Cooper. "I don't know how we 
can change that perception. The 

Students face crowded writing c/asse=. because oj reallocation oj budget. 

admtnl!Jtration ce rtainly could do 
more than' it does. (The 
admtnistratlon) to a large part 
determines the kind of feature 
artides (and) reports whic h 
appear in the newspapers and all 
the magazines 

"Whether or not those of us in 
the humanities are slighted, the 
people responsible for the 
community's understanding of 
what we're doing here and of the 
image of the campus in Southern 
Califomia should do much more 
to ... inform the community 
about the important work being 
done here in the arts and 
humanities," 

Literature Department 
Chairman Donald Wesling 
agreed with Cooper's assessment, 
saying "the administration and 
the campus don't reaUy know 
enough about our 'grand design' 
to be a department that works 
with writing; aU the way from 
beginning writers as freshmen, 
up to the part where people are 
graduates in a composition 
theory program." 

But Wesling said he feels the 
administration is doing as much 
as they can to fund the literature 
programs in the midst of larger, 
more expensive and profitable 
science-oriented programs. 

"It is a new major in the 
scheme of things (and has) 
grown incrementally from year to 
year ," Wesling said. He said that 
the department has asked for 

1l funding to hire one more full-
:?i time fiction writer to teach 
~ writing workshops and nf)W the 
l; department is \'.'airing for a reply. 
:= ' We're waiting now to see i what the administration decides. 

It is for them to decide," said 
Wesling. He added that there is 

THE 

a desire to add a "creative wing" 
to get the "same kind of 
recognition" that visual arts and 
drama receive. "T hey understand 
and they're hoping to help us, 
but they have man y other th ings 
to fund ." he said. 

Unlike Davidson , Wesling said 
he has quite a bit of optimism 
about the future of the literature 
department and of the writing 
major. Fifth college, scheduled to 
open in Fall 1988, is something 
to which Wesling said he looks 
fo rv.-a rd. 

"We think we would ha~ a 
central role to play in that," he 
said, adding that the requirement 
of a language at the college may 
interest students in studying the 
culture and literature of different 
peoples. 

If the question at the core of 
the problem (once again, 
depending on who is talking, the 
problem is either tremendous or 
non-existent,) is one of support, 
as it seems to be, one can only 
deduce that the writing major 
and the literarure depallment in

network , last week they visited. 
They could not stay more than

importantly, the Russians could

general, rests only in a state of 
confusion . 

DaVIdson says many campus 
academia carry a "medieval 
theory" of teaching. and feels 
that the professors need only to 
teach students the basic parts of 
speech and writing will flow 
naturally. 

"I think the fact that this kind 
of attitude , this sort of knee-jerk 
criticism, that is directed at the 
writing program implies just a 
general distrust and antagonism 
towards writing, and my 
extension and humanities in 
general," Davidson said . 

BU! Chodorow said the writing 
program could not have greater 
support and enthusiasm from the 
administration . 

"This campus cares so much 
about its writing. If support for 
the writing (program) is 
indicated by time spent (and) 
concem expressed on the 
writing programs, then we're big 
supporters," Chodorow said. "If 
we didn't care then we wouldn't 
pay any attention to them." ~

nuclear test site, 

National Resources Defense 
Council said, "The Reagan 
Administration would permit the 
Soviet Scientists to vistit the 
seismic sites only if they agreed 
to wimess a U.S. nuclear 
explosion." 

In response to our 
government's overall Jolicies, 
Brune skeptically sai ,"Even if 
we can monitor nuclear tests , the 
government still depc;nds on 
nuclear weapons and will 
therefore continue nuclear 
tests."

Re: The Cold Fish piece, The 
Koala , OC!. 29. 1986. 

I find it mdefensible to 
Include such a blatantly seXiSt 
promotion for VIOlence agamst 
women in a campus newspaper. 
In an age where violen e 
(particularly agamst women) runs 
rampant throughout our nation, 
making "fun" of such sl!uations 
In the media goes well beyond 
the boundaries of taste and 
responsibility. 

Freedom of speech and of the 
press are Important 
considerations, but the)' do not 
mingate the opposition the 
public (campus community in 
thiS instance) can exhibit by 
vOlcmg objections to such 
expressions. In fact, such 
opinions clearly do nO! reflect 
lhe opinions or attitudes of 
many persons on thiS campus as 
well as other communines 

I would hope thaI the starr of 
The Koala would exercise more 
restraint in the future - and 
refrain from perpetuating such a 
demeaning, potentially 
dangerous, seXiSt VIew of women .

We realize that freedom of

that degrades women in this

this regard , we would like to 
offer some possible solutions 
which may assist in eliminating 
articles such as this in the future . 

We suggest that a set of 
guidelines that regulate standards 
for printed material on campus 
should be established . These 
guideline should be deSigned to 
protect members of our campus 
community from distasteful and 
derogatory statements . 
Additionally, we would like to

The "Cold Fish" amcle which 
appeared m the October 29th 
Issue of The Koala IS an example 
of the kmd of "smut" The_Koala 
contmues to print In their 
newspaper. It not only 
encourages and sanctlons 

violence againSt women (I.e . 
rape. battcnng, and even 
"murder"), but increases 
acceptance of such Violence. 

Great strides are being made 
In raising consciousness and 
awareness about the reality of 
rape and other acts of violence 
against women. Women and 
men, In fact, are beginning to re-
evaluate traditional male-female 
roles and to change societal 
attitudes, only to have the above 
article come along and set us 
back another step. As long as the 
many myths and misconceptions 
about rape continue. we will nO! 
be able to reduce the incidence 
of rape . The myth that "women . 
fantasize about rape" is 
reinforced In the above article 
WIth the statement, "We are the 
beginning to every woman's 
nighonare come true ."

The Koala, by such an article, 
not only degrades women but 
also degrades men, showi ng 
them as animals who are only 
interested in "one th ing." All men 
are depicted as "expecting 
something in return for an 
evening ou!," Researc hers have 
found that the media (in this 
case a campus newspaper) , by 
printing articles such as the 
above, can lead to anti-social 
attitudes and behavior. The 
article not only demeans sorority 
women ("sorority teases, frigid 
bitch"), but women who do nOt 
"consent" to sex on a date or any 
woman who asserts her "righ t to 
say no." The article encourages 
the attitude that men should take 
whatever means are necessary to 
engage a woman in sex, 
suggesting that the man arrange 

. to "drug her drink" and "if that 
doesn't work ." to teach her a 
lesson . 

So, Koala , although we are 
aware thal the media is 
guaranteed freedom of speech, 
the above anicle may exceed the 
bounds of the kind of speech 
you are guaranteed and may 
stray into that area of 
unprotected speech. 

Our program, and the many 
women and men on campus 
who have expressed their 
outrage to us , not only demand 

an apology, but demand that The 
Koala discontinue its practice of 
printing such material and that 
the newspaper adopt stricter 
guidelines for future a rticles and 
advertisements.

Editor: 

Talk about hypocrites. How 
dare Greg MacCrone rretend to 
subscribe to the belie "free 
speech mean free speech for 
everybody." He is the one who 
recently felt so threatened by the 
expression of a view con nicting 
with hiS own that he resorted to 
physical abuse. I'm curious where 
MacCrone d raws the line of 
"infringement on the rights of 
others." Is he exempt from the 
obvious intrusion physical force 
represents? The weakest display 
of "power" is physical force -
and I shudder to realize that our 
Senator is not only capable of 
this SOrt of abuse, but has such a 
lack of self control that he 
exercises it. 

If what he said is true , he 
would welcome any contribution

As a member of the silent

MacCrone and his inaccurate 
assumptions. 

As for his personal anack 
against one of the very few 
constructive and organized 
groups of students on campus. it 
is JUSt further evidence of his 
hypocrisy. He condemns their 
existence simply because their

views oppose his own. ( tend to 
believe that the "faceless 
graduates" working for 
organizations on campus are in 
fact a resource, and provide an 
example of consistency rather 
than inconsistency (as MacCrone 
says.) They are consistent in 
sticking to what they believe in , 
rather than sacrifici ng their 
ideals fo r a shallow, material 
existence, as many Others from 
their grad uating class have 
probably done. Next time, I 
would thi nk twice before 
speaking for the silent majority.

have finally seen fit to take up 
the cudgel and defend "Freedom 
of Speech" for the "Silent 
MaJoney." I wonder, though, why 
you waited unul now to Jom the 
fray? Why didn't we hear from 
you last year when students from 
this and other campuses were 
being beaten and jailed for 
protesting the UC Regents' 
Investment of our money in 
South Africa? Your peculiar sense 
of timing makes me wonder JUSt 
what you mean by "Freedom of 
Speech ." Most people I know 
agree that some kinds of "free 
speech" are socially hannful. 

The same students who VOted 
you into the AS council also 
voted, by a large majority, to bar 

military recruitment from UCSD. 
Wah undisguised contempt for 
democracy, the (unelected) 
univerSity administration keeps 
inviting the recruiters OntO 
campus If you truly support 
democracy, then why do you 
side with them in disputes with 
students over the presence of the 
military on our campus? 

Whether or not we may agree on 
the appropriateness of his 
methods, when Arnie Schoenberg 
threw red paint on Army 
literature , he was only Insisting 
in his own way that our right to 
say "No" to militarism on our 
campus should be respected . For 
this reason , ( stand squarely 
behind him.

You seem to find it more 
urgent to protect free speech for 
the military than for UCSD 
students. I can sort of see your 
point: after all, the military has 
always been oppressed by 
vicious minorities trying to 
prevent them from exercising 
thei r legally-protected rights, 

To me, defending the 
military's freedom of speech from 
UCSD students is about as 
courageous and socially 
necessary as defending 
McDonalds corporation from a 
few desperate cows. Is the 
freedom to do this what makes 
you so proud to be Americans? 
Whose University is this if it isn't 
ours? Andy Howard

Won't you smile for the camera? 
By SEAN KENEFICK. copy Edilor 

L ET me tell you, I didn't know what hit me. She had said yes! Elise had finally 
agreed to marry me, and, of 
course, I was elated. My parents 
had been hesitant at first, but 
being the wonderful people they 
are, they understood how much I 
wanted this beauriful lady for my 
own. 

I was JUSt graduating from 
UCSD with a 3.6 grade point 
average as an EECS major. IBM 
had just called me the day before 
with a sixty thousand dollar a 
year job offer. The bank had JUSt 
given Elise and I the go ahead 
on our new home. 

I was ready for the world. 
Everything was going so 

well ... suspiciously well. It just 
seemed too good to be true. AI; a 
child , I had always wanted twO 
things: to be a hillbilly in 
Tennessee, or to be a rich 
married man with 2.5 kids. And 
here I was reaching one of those 
goals. 

Elise and I were going 10 
announce our engagement at my 
graduation party. And to think! I 

ha~ cruised through my classes 
In Just four years! 

I should have known 
something was wrong, bur I 
wasn't thinking. 

I arrived at my party in a tux 
and a pair of shades. Elise and I 
announced our engagement and 
the family was ecstatic. A line 
formed so everyone could 
congratulate us, and I began to 
graciously exchange their well 
wishes with humble thanks. 

Out of the comer of my eye , I 
saw a short bald man coming up 
the reception line who looked 
very familiar. He kept working 
his way towards me; 
nevertheless, I couldn't figure out 
who he was. He wasn 't family; 
and I didn't think he was a 
friend of Dad's. 

I suddenly did not want to 
meet this s.mall man. I began to 
sweat heavily, but still I shook 
Uncle Jack's hand and kissed 
Aunt Pearl . Elise, standing next 
to me , was as bright and as 
sparkling as ever - she felt no 
ill precognitions. I found myself 
speaking mechanically as I 

watched this man walking closer 
and closer. 

He started to shake my hand 
and my stOmach tightened. The 
taste of bile in my mouth was 
unbearable. 

"Congratulations," he 
cheerfully remarked , robustly 
crushing my fingers. He turned 
tOwards the rest of the family 
and the room became 
noiseless . .. the idle chatter 
c~ased . Everyone began to softly 
gIggle as I PUt all my attention to 
this man. 

"Well, now: the man 
continued. "Your life is going 
great, isn't it?" 

My eyebrows lowered in 
suspicion. ·Yes sir," I answered. 
"It is." 

The man's face became 
pensive. "Could you smile for 
me?"

I shut my eyes as hot tears 
stung my cheeks. The room 
remained as still as a 
photograph. 

"Suddenly the 
room was fi lled with 
cheers that assaulted 
my ears like nothing 
ever had before, " 

The man repeated the 
quesnon . "Could you smile for 
me? 

"You 're on candid camera!" 
Suddenly, the room was filled 

with cheers that assaulted my 
ears like nothing ever had 
before . A moving wall told me 
that I was in a television studio 
in front of a live audience . Elise 
and my family began to laugh.

I tried to force a smile. 
Allen Funt was given a 

microphone . As he glibly 
addressed the audience, stabbing 
thoughts entered my head . 

It's not possible. I'm on Candid 
Camera . My whole life is a hoax. 
I'm not a doctor, I j~l play one on 
TV. 

My host began to introduce 
my famIly to the audience. I 
stood on the middle of the tage 
s~eat pouring down my face . ' 
Ehse stepped forward and Allen 
hugged her hard . 

"Playing the part of Ehse 
Wilson: he stammered, "was 
Gertrude Polineski. Tell me , 
Gertrude. was it hard work?" 

Gertrude? 

She beamed. "Well, Allen , it 
wasn't easy! I remember one time 
when he " ,," 

One by one , everyone I had 
ever known appeared on that 
stage. They all had amUSing 
stories to tell about my life. The 
crowd loved it . 

I stood frozen, smiling. 
My cherished memories were 

carelessly spewed out by the 
people that I loved. When my 
mother was introduced, I wet my 
pants. But my smile didn 't fade . 

My mother, shOWing off for 
the camera, began relaying the 
story about the loss of my 
virginity. Then they showed a 
clip. The audience applauded my 
bare butt and rolled in laughter 
when 1 asked my girl it it had 
been good for her. The girl 
entered from stage right and 
received a generous ovation. 

And I stood smiling. 
My father was introduced. He 

had a Bronx accent. What do 
you know? 

And I swod smiling. 
Chancellor Atkinson made a 

brief appearance to explain how 
my GPA was really a 1.6, and 
that my IBM representative was 
really a down-and-out actor from 
Detroit. 

And I stood smiling. 
My sister prepared the 

audience for the clip of how she 
caught me with my first Playboy 
when I was thirteen . 

That's when I fainted. 
I woke up somewhere in 

downtown San Diego. I was 
wearing a new suit and had a 
crisp twenty dollar bill in my 
pants pocket. 

I walked over to 1-8 East and 
stuck out my thumb . An old man 
in a yellow Ford stopped his car 
and asked me where I was 
heading. 

I smiled.

Men's basketball bombers launch attack 
Long range shooters should highlight this season's offense 
By MATI I.AlT, News Editor 

No matter what the night held for them they rise with the sun. 
Sporting their sweats and 
hightops they walk into the gym, 
lay down on the cold hardwood 
floors , and stretch their tired 
muscles. At 6:30 am, basketball 
head coach Tom Marshall barks 
a command and the Triton 
players line up to wannup with 
layups. 

This is the fourth year 
Marshall has led these practices 

tryIng to come up WIth a 
winning team and a successful 
season. Although his teams have 
always been good, he has never 
quite been able to make it to the 
playoffs. This season, however, 
has definite possibilities of being 
dIfferent - thanks to some top-
notch recruiting he did this 
summer. 

WhIle many people were 
vacationing in the sun, Marshall 
was busy hanging out in the 
gyms trying to lure new recruits 

to the program He managed to 
anract the number-one scorer in 
the nation for DiVISIOn I, lI, l\l 
and NAJA along WIth SIX players 
over 6'5". 

"I finIshed the season thinking 
I had to recruit some big men, 
but in the middle of summer I 
was aware of the fact I had to get 
a poim guard because I lost both 
Alvarado and Smith," Marshall 
said . Alvarado and mith were 
the team's twO point guards. 

With this In mind , Marshall 

With or without · CC, 1M 
hockey flourishes at UCSD 
By KAREN KUMM, Staff Wnter 

GROWING up in Canada, I accepted hockey as Americans accept football . 
Most Iinle boys played on hockey 
teams , and practiced on the 
streets and in driveways. The 
neighborhood parks had ice 
rinks where we could all practice 
our skating and hockey skills. In 
California, I believe that the kids 
take up surfing instead. This lack 
of childhood familiarity with 
hockey seems to have little effect 
on the sport of floor hockey; 
here at UCSD the intramural 
program is thriving! 

"What I like best about hockey 
is that it is fast and it is 
exciting," says Steve Kent of 
Captain Dick and His Seamen. 
Kent is in charge of the 
intramural floor hockey program 
and is a top scorer in AM. 
"Everyone can get involved in 
the action, it requires a total 
effort by every player. It really is 
a team Sport." 

Kent played ice hockey in 
Minneapolis fo r 7 years. His 
fonner high school coach is the 
new hockey coach for the 1988 
Olympic team. "I SlOpped football 
because I stopped growing. In 
ice hockey your size is no 
matter," explained Kent, "There 
are so many things you have 
to do well ." Skating ability and 
sticking skills are 01 primary 
importance. floor hockey is 
played on the cement floor and 
with a ban instead of a puck. 
The rules adhere closely to those 
of ice hockey. 

In the San Diego area, the 
UTC skating rink is the best 
facility 10 be found . It is used 
primarily by figure skaters and 
the general public , rather than by 
hockey teams. Hockey lessons 
are provided for children, but 
adult clubs and leagues just do 
not exist. "There's no interest 
here," explained Kent , "Hockey 
fans in San Diego need to have 
some kind of prior experience 
wi th it or be from back east. If 
we had a professional team, 
hockey would get a lot more 
exposure." Kent also complained 
that the television coverage is 
minimal and of poor quality. 
"Ted Lightner on Channel Eight 
Just covers the fights that break 
out between players." The Los 
Angeles area is more receptive to 
the sport, largely because they 
have a professionaltcam, the 
LA KIngs 

Scott Bemde , dIrector of 
U D tntramurals , fell in love 

Hockey has become a popular sport an campus despite the warm climate. 

with floor' hockey because "It is 
the best workout." Players have 
the whole rec gym as their 
playing area, and spend the 
entire game "Running back and 
forth at full speed." The floor 
hockey program is expanding 
every year, and Berndes is 
anxious to have a new facility to 
accomodate the growth of this 
and aQ other spons. "I have 
people playing floor hockey till 1 
or 2 am because there is no 
other time for them." 

Though hockey is commonly 
thought of as a violent sport. 
Berndes is proud to say that 
"There have been no fights and 
only one stick-swingIng 
incident," in the nine years that 
he has been at UCSD. This 
accounts for 200-300 games a 
year. 

Currently, the two tOP MA 
teams on the intramural scene 
are Blitzkrieg and Captain Dick 
and hIS amen. Many players 
are from the east coast, a few 
from Canada, yet a lot are Just 
n.l!Jves who picked up the SpOrt 
In college Joe Pencil has pla)'Cd 

hockey all of his life in Boston 
and made the Junior Olympic 
leam. Don and Mike Peterson are 
San Diegans whose parents are 
avid ice hockey fans. Keith 
Lazerson's father is the team 
doctor for the LA Kings. 
Berndes described Steve Kent as 
"the ghuru of floor hockey." 

floor hockey games are taken 
very seriously by the players, 
"They want to win ," says Kent. A 
less competitive, more fun-
oriented time to play the game is 
during "Open Rec," Fridays 10-
12 am and 2-4 pm. About 30 
players from all leagues get 
together to play for fun , mixing 
the teams fairly and just having a 
good time. Players not involved 
in the intramural program are 
encouraged to show up to meet 
some new people and brush up 
on their hockey skills. _ 

For Steve Kent and other 
serious players, the intramural 
floor hockey program is the best 
way to satisfy their passion for 
Ice hockey. Maybe if the winters 
In San DIego get a little colder 
thetr enthusiasm Mil spread . Ia:J 

treked up north to Santa Cruz 
and was able to get one of the 
deadliest scoring point .guards in 
DiVIsion !II ball today, John 
Sa Inngnon. 

SaIntignon , who averaged 32 
points a game, was unhappy at 
UCSC and the coach was 
apparently not pleased with 
Salntignon. "I think the coach at 
Santa Cruz wanted more of a 
team player," Marshall said. 

"I wanted to get into a 
program that would push me:' 
Saimignon said. "The coaches 
here are makIng me work. They 
run thIS (program) like It'S a 
Division I schoo\." 

Marshall and the rest of the 
team feels that Saintignon will be 
an excellent addition to the 
starting lineup which features 
twO other Top Gun scorers, Greg 
Kamansky and Brian Backens. 

Kamansky was the Tritons' 
leading scorer last year, setting 
several scoring records includIng 
most points In one game WIth 
40. If he has another year like 
the last, Kamansky will become 
the Tritons' all-time scorer. "I 
don't think anyone will be able 
to stop' us if our backcourt gets 
hot: Kamansky Said. 

Backens is UCSD's other 
offensive threat. He set a school 
record by shooting 60 percent 
from the field . 

"This year we will definitely be 
scoring a lot of points," Marshall 
said . "Not only will our backcourt 
be doing a good job but we'll 
also be getting a lot of suppOrt 
from our frontcourt men , 
especially Andy Jedynak. 

Jedynak is the team's big man 
center standing 6'10". He is the 
man with the "vicious bows." 
He'll tear down a rebound and 

swmg his elbows around to deter 
anyone else from trymg to steal it 
away from hIm. 

"Andy has Improved his game 
greatly He's spent a lot of time 
into hIS game thIS summer and 
we're expecting a great deal from 
hIm ," Marshall said. 

The laSt fo rward spot on the 
team is open for several players 
to win. Andy Wagstaff and Steve 
Dabasinskas are twO returners 
who look the most promising. 
But according to Marshall, there 
is some very good young blood. 
ready to make formidable 
challenges to the lineup. 

"This year, our team is very 
excited about the season," 
Marshall said, "I thInk the feeling 
everyone has IS mass optimism." 

This is contrary to the feelings 
the team experienced last year 
when players were not as 
together. "No doubt about it, we 
were fragmented last year, but I 
think It happens anytime you get 
15 people together. Three or four 
of the players become close, 
while another three or four 
players become close. You always 
are going to get that. I don't 
think you can get 15 guys that 
are all buddy-buddy with their 
arms around each other walking 
into a bar and drinking suds 
after the game. I just don't see 
that happening," Marshall said. 

"This group has that clique 
attitude to far lesser degrees than 
we had last year. This is going to 
be a great year. We're going to 
make some heads tum and 
pepple are going to say, 'Hey, 
UCSD can play basketall. These 
guys are for real:" Marshall said. 

Spirit night, the Tritons' 
opening game, statts at 7:30 pm

Waterpolo: top 
seed' in NIT 
By DARREN KjELDSEN 

W HEN we last left the UCSD water polo team, things weren't 
going so well. They had recorded 
six losses in a row to Division I 
scholarship schools. UCSD may 
not be a Division I team, but 
they are as close to it as a team 
can get. The Tritons believe they 
are as good or bener than most 
scholarship schools and they 
would like some other people to 
believe it as well. They played 
tough with some of ~ top ten 
teams in the nation, teams like 
California and UCSB. The 
Tritons will try to prove they can 
compete with almost any team, 
and this weekend should 
demonstrate to some poeple just 
how good they are . 

UCSD barely missed making 
the NCAA open tournament, 
which has the top eight teams in 
the country, all Division I 
schools. UCSD will play this 
weekend in the National 
Invitational Tournament at 
Canyonview, which happens to 
consist of the next eight best 
teams in the country. The 
Tritons are the number one seed. 
They won the tournament laS! 
year and should win it this year. 
U D has been 10 the finals 

every year since 1981. ow, of 
course the teams in this 
tournament are not all Division I 
schools, but they are as close as 
you can get. as they make up a 
large part of the top twenty in 
the nation. 

Besides UCSD, the second 
and third seeds in the tourney 
are 12th ranked Claremom and 
13th ranked Cal State LA. The 
rest of the seeds, in order, are 
Santa Clara, UC Davis, Pomona-
Pitzer, Loyola-Marymount, and 
Whittier College. The Tritons, 
Claremont and Cal State I..A 
should dominate the tournament, 
and it should be a battle between 
them for the championship. 

UCSD opens with a match 
Friday morning, at Canyonview 
against Pomona-Pitzer. The 
match is scheduled for 9:00 am. 
After that contest, the Tritons will 
have a few hours rest before 
taking on Whittier. UCSD should 
WIn handily on Friday, but on 
Saturday they will play the fourth 
seed, Santa Clara, and from then 
on it should be tough 
competition. 

omething UCSD really needs 
is some fan suppOrt in order to 
make the home advantage a real 
advantage . Il::J

An Arts Magazine Serving the UCSD Community 

Vol , 13, No, 9 November 20. 1986 

San. Diego Rep. mastering Fugard 
Lon before the oppressive 

apartfieid South Afrfcan 
government became an issue 
that flooded the American 
news media, a South African 
native had been documenting 
the destructive nature of the 
political system and its effects 
on the daily lives of the people 
in his plays and journals. 
Writer and director Anthol 
Fugard, born in Cape 
Province in 1932, dedicates 
himself to exposing the 
abundance of racist-based 
hatred in South Africa and the 
injuries this incurs. 

"South Africa is starving to 
death from a lack of love. This 
country is in the grips of its 
worst drought - and that 
drought is in the human 
heart." Fugard was quoted as 
saying. His play 'Mastel' 
Harold ' .. . and the berys, which 
deals with the nature of love, 
is playing from November 21 
through January 11 at the 
Lyceum Space Theater in 
Horton Plaza. 

In his play, Fugard 
masterfully exposes how the 
irrational power of racism can 
overtake one's own natural 
inclination to love, and it's 
not always painless. 

The relationships between 
the three characters , Master 
Harold ("Hally"), Sam and 
Willie, are filled with 
complexity, involving dual 
feelings of pa ternity and 
servility. Hally is a 17 year-old 
white boy who is left in charge 
of the negro workers Sam and 

bv suzanne j.HflOn 
Willie, both in their 40's, 
when his mother is visiting 
HaUy's crippled father at the 
'fl06pital. . 

The play takes place on a 
iny afternoon in a slightly 

claustrophobic tearoom in 
Port Elizabeth, South Africa 
I 1950. Hally spends much 
of bis time sharing his 
hom ork with "the boys" 

their only means of 
education. While Hally 
teaches them about history 
and essy-writing, "the boy" 
Sam teaches Hally and Willie 
about the ugly honesty within 
ourselves jNhich we aU need 
to face. also informs them 
about thl sensitivity necessary 
in rela nships and how to be 
am, something Hally's 
father ~ took the time to 
do. 

Alth.c:.._·l __ ........ 
have s 
together. 
never be 0 
Hally's whit~ 
gives him po 
word, even e 
than twice hil .... III 
frustration, he .. 1trU1I ....... 
like a little despot" In otcltuo 
vent his anger and -.m 
order in the tear • 

The tension rises at a crucial 
moment when Hally ... too 
far by spitting out cruel and 
demeaning utterances about 
his white superiority. Tht, 
ends up impa iring his 
relationship with Sam and 
Willie forever . The scene 
captures the attention of the 
audien e and makes one 

question his or her own set of 
values and treatment of 
others. 

In 1980. Fugard's play A 
Lesson From Aloes. which also 
concerns itself with South 
African issues, won the New

Jazz Unlimited opens its season this weekend with three 
premier works and a bevy of guest artists. San Diego's 
leading jazz dance company has never failed to fulfill the 
high expectations of dance lovers; its upcoming 
performance should be no exception. Artistic Director 
Patricia Rincon frequently collaborates with artists 
throughout the San Diego area, highlighting local talent in 
a unique way. 

Jonathan Barnes is one of these artists. He is not only a 
choreographer, but in the past has also composed and 
performed the music for his pieces. He joins his wife, 
Kelly Grant, for this performance to present one of the 
premier pieces, entitled "Between the Two of Us." 
"Lucid Dreams" and "Back to the Bop" are the other 
premier works choreographed by Patricia Rincon and 
Alicia Rincon' respectively. 

Other guest artists include well-known jazz dancers 
Tony Caligagan, who will be appearing in "The Path", and 
Phil Fontilea, who will be seen in "Lead Boots," a high-
kicking cowboy number with music by Vassar Clements. 
La Jolla artist Alice Culbert created a sculpture 
specifically for the piece "Found Rhythm" for a 
collaboration of dance and art. 

Jazz Unlimited will be performing at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art, Sherwood Auditorium 
on November 21 and 22 at 8 pm. Ticket prices are $7 for 
students, seniors and museum members, and $11 for 
general admission.

Action, a brash and 
controversial multi-media 
masterwork featuring slide 
and film projections, video 
inserts, and the acclaimed 
acting of San Diego's own 
Douglas Roberts . This 
production of Shepard's 
unique and little-known work 
originated in a television 
studio here at UCSD, and will 
run from November 22 to 
December 7 at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre's Sixth 
Avenue Playhouse. 

Directed by Scott Feldsher, 
Action marks the first 
performance in the new Sixth 
Avenue Playhouse. Working 
in conjunction with the Rep, 
the Sledgehammer troupe 
extended the theatre's stage by 
eight feet and reduced the 
seating capacity from 211 
persons to 178. "This is now 
one of the best stages in 
town," said Feldsher, who 
doubles as the Rep's

until this year Boston had not 
released an album in eight 
years, both of which are 
upsetting facts to their 
respective fans. However, the 
music world will have to wait 
no longer. After releasing 
their self-titled, best selling

and the 1978 folJow-up Don't

out of existence only to 
reappear last month with the 
release of Third Stage.

WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO 
CAll YOUR GRANDPARENTS? 

a) Five minutes into uThe Lawrence"Welk Show:' 
b) About a week before your birthday. 
c) When you iust want to tell them you miss 

them, and that you ate the last of Grandma's 
chocolate-chip cookies this moming. 

There's nothing'grandparents like better than a call from a 
grandchild in college. But if you do accidentally happen to inter-
rupt Lawrence, you ought to have something worth telling them. 

For example, you could mention that you called using 
AT&T Long Distance Service because you can depend on 
AT&T's high quality service and exceptional value. 

And then you can tell them that AT&T gives you 
immediate credit if you dial a wrong number. 

And that you can count on AT&T 
for clear long distance 

connections. 
Finally, of cour e, you 

should quickly reassure 
them that you're eating 
enough, then let them 
hurr back to the TV 
to catch the rest of the

The Animal Bowl 
I call this one 'the end of dynasry bowl'. Let's 

PUt llthis way, either by graduation or by losing 
this Sunday, we will be seeing the end of a true 
1M dynasry, The fine gentlemen from The York 
Hunt Club have been in the MA finals the last 
four years, They have won the coveted Animal 
Bowl championship three of those four years, 
and have actually IQst only once in those four 
years. That was in the 1983 championship 
game. Their four year record is 30-1. York wants 
to go OUt with one more wm. 

On the other end of the spectrum is a whole 
different Story. This involves York's opponents 
this Sunday, The Herd. You see, they have been 
on the threshold of the Antmal Bowl 
championship many, man)' times but have 
never drank the champagne. They have been 
chasmg York sooo many years they would make 
Avis feel good. But second place will not do for 
them thiS year. Their motto is 'we want It 
Badddd!' They swear they won't be denied, 
This is also their last shot at the title before 
graduation. 

These old friends Will met'! for the last time 
out on the old gndron. Chns Ferrex running 
that ballet like POSt comer against the stingiest 
DB to ever play here, Louie DeMarco. Brian 
Mequet using his stork-like body and beautiful 
moves to try to deceive thai little rock Doug 
Roche. The line play will also be very interesting 
with York's always tough ruggers, Paul Foster 
and An Albens, versus the mammoths for The 
Herd, led by Hall of Famer Mike Mitchell. 

What a ball game It will be. York trying 10 Win 
one last championship. The Herd trymg to 
fmally win the roses. ThiS game looks toolOugh 
for me to pick. Good luck all. It's been great ' 

The Banana Bowl 
Call this the '1M Directors got duped Bowl'. 

There is an unwritten rule that when you win a 
diVISion the next year you automatically move 
to the nex t higher division. Well , guess who 
won Men's M football last year? Yep, W/out 
Wood did! I've been told by the head dudes in 
the 1M office that they didn't realIZe that the 
players were all drama majors here at UCSD. 
That the players on W/ out Wood cried and 
begged nOt to be put with the big boys in AAA 
because their whole team had really graduated. 
What an act they PUt on! The worst part was 
that they were beheved. 

So now they find themselves right where they 
kIll'W they would be, In the Banana Bowl: same 
bowl, same sandbagging, same guys. Let's see; 
there's 2nd team All-1M Wide re elver Allen 
Gldner who led 1M's In receiving for the second 
year In a row, there's Martin Arrelano who was 
last year's All-1M guard Tony Glambone, 
everyone's favorite RA. from Third. I've heard 
that the York Hunt Club and The Herd, thl> 
year's AAA finalists, brealhed a Sigh of relief 
when the 1M Directors let W l out Wood play M . 

My goodness , who IS the poor team who 
must face W/ out Wood In the final . By luck It 
turns out that It IS the second year med school 
team called P-MD II. They may need all their 
medical talents after pLaYing a AAA cahber team 
To add to the ObviOUS ability difference , their 
very talented QB Adam Flerer IS OUt with 
Itgament damage to hiS ankle. II they have a 
chance they must get a great game from All-1M 
Wide receiver Barry Cromer, back up QB SCot 
Highlander and the best pass rush thiS Side of 
the New York G,ants 

Look for thiS one to be a blowout. Also look 
for the 1M Directors to offiCially put In a written 
rule about drama majors who want to sandbag 

The Cadaver Bowl 
Unfortunately for yours truly thiS darn 

Intramural program IS getting tOO dam big. In 
the Men 's A diVISion there are so many teams 
we still haven't gotten to the fmals of the 
QlVlslon. The semi-finals Will be played thiS 
Saturday at noon so I don't know who IS in the 
finals yet . I will do a brief synopsis of each team 
to give you an Idea of their chances. 

Tijuana Vice have been destroying teams 
with their unique no huddle offense. Won one 
playolT game 54-13. Have great wide-outs and a 
QB who will lull you to sleep and then to defeat. 
Looks like the team to beat. 

Breast Kanser ~ a defenSive team who plays 
aggressively. Look out for the center on thiS 
team. He IS the leading receiver. Gee, I hope I 
don't give away any of your secrets.

running game. QB is not bad but they like to run 
the option ice untes. 

Oh 0 Its Cra::y '0' is almost Identical to 
Crosseyed and Painless except their opponents 
arc JUSt a tad better at all po mons except the 
enter. The original Fndge, AI Villa, IS one of the 

top centcrs m A ball 

My prediction IS that somebody will fi nally 
figure out that Tijuana Vice hves and dies by the 
bomb and will take It away. That team will be 
Crosseyed & Painless. 

The Climax Bowl 
I call thiS bowl the 'ugly bowl'. That'sjust what 

thiS game will be m more ways than one. On 
paper the tcams look pretry Similar. As tn each 
team puts three guys and three gals on the field 
at once. But beheve me that's where the 
similarities end. 

Team Desperados WinS ugly and always has. 
These ghouls have always felt that mtlmldatlon 
was the way to the championship. You know 
the old splt-In-their-eyc theory. But this year 
they recruited some talent togo along with their 
Oakland Raider-rype tactics. 

With the likes of All-1M Karen Prather and 
sure-handed Mary Beth Murrey they have been 
Winning by so much that It IS ugly. In all their 
games combined this year they have a scoring 
margin of 235-26. That's an average of 40-6 
every game they play. Whew' That 's ugly. 

But what about the Roche Swatters? They 
would probably win the champIOnship ifTeam 
Desperado were not plaYing thiS year. The)' are 
definitely the second best team. They have 
destroyed teams almost as easily as Team 
Desperado. They have some good looking lady 
talent In Captain Rita Debacco, Mansa Napoles, 
Karla Drodz and superstar so cer player Laurie 
O'Connell. The guys aln't tOO shabby either 
wah speedy Dave Vasil and Mike Mitchell. But 
realit), wtll be a tough nut to swallow come 
Sunday. The Desperados probably should be 
playtng Men's AA or even AAA with their talent . 
Look for them to wtn big. 

The Soul Bowl 
ThiS bowl I would like to name 'slow and 

slower meets super wheels'. Now I don't want to 
generalize. but I Will of course, In mOSt cases the 
male of our species IS faster than the female . So, 
when I talk about slow and slower you would 
assume that I am talking about some of the 
female player, Wrong, moose breath' I'm 
talking aboul the guys on the appropriately 
named luggos. Have you ever heard the phrase 
'That guy runs hke he'~ gOt a plano on hi!> back? 
That guy happen, to be Sluggo player Jeff Iko. 
Also have you heard the one where they say the 
guy has 'square wheels'? Well, that happens to 
be Mr. Sluggos himself, Jack Meercham. ThiS 
guy Invented slow. Boy thiS team seems to be 10 
trouble. You 're RIGHT. they are! 

They must face the Madehne Sch neider 
Show and The Dicks & Dike>. You know you're 
in trouble when the ladles arc faster than the 
guys. That will be the ca.e tn thiS game. 
Madeline is a speed burner. There IS no one 
woman, nor man on the S1uggos. who can cover 
her one-o n-one. She can play With the best of 
them as proven by her pick as AIl·IM Wide 
receiver.

BUD LIGHT TEAM OF THE WEEK 

Bud Light Team of the Week 
GO TO HEll ROY! 

Before the coed season staned, Roy Kinoshita and Nick Fohl decided to defect 
from their friend's team and fonn their own team. So they took the best players, so 
they thought, and they became Calvin&: 50bbes. Well, these guys and gals got mad. 
They wanted to get even. So their name became GO TO HELL ROY!! They even 
went funher than that. They became Spud's own Team of the Week. 

In their game against ITS ALIVE, theywere down 5-1 in the first 9 minutes of the 
game. It looked really bad for them. That's when Jay Kaufman and Minna Rauhala 
took the matter into their own hands. Before you can say "gimmaa Light" the team 
scored 9 straight goals. Wow! What a team! We salute GO TO HELL ROY!! Great 
job. As ror Calvin & abbes, well, Jay &: Minna's tcam name says it all.

Thank 
God it's 
Lindley 

by ken calhoun 
Yes, it's hard to believe, but 

tomorrow night is this 
quarter's last T.O. And, as if 
this fact alone is not reason 
enough to celebrate, master 
musician David lindley and 
his band will be there playing 
plenty of party tunes. 

David lindley. You might 
not have heard his name 
before, but chances are, you 
have heard his work. Because 
not only can lindley pound 
out rock~and~roll appropriate 
for this gym porch party, but 
his skills surpass that basic 
beat focus. His composing 
and instrumental talents have 
taken. him deep into the 
mystical realm of session 
recording, a place where only 
the best dare go and the likes 
of pop's hitmakers are careful 
to avoid. 

Lindley has contributed to 
major works by James Taylor; 
Linda Ronstadt; Crosby, 
Stills, and Nash; Rod Stewart; 
and, most significantly, 
Jackson Browne. More 
recently, he has worked with 
fellow multi~talented 
musician Ry Cooder. 
Together, they collaborated 
on the sound tracks of the 
films The Long Riders, Paris, 
Texas, and Alamo Ray. 

David Lindley performs this Friday 
at the T.G. 

But despite all the 
seriousness of the session 
work, lindley has recently 
released his latest album, as if 
to remind us of the basic 
importance of beat~oriented 
sounds,. The album, "Mr. 
Dave," features precious 
samples of passionate people 
music. The tunes are flavored 
with R&B,. reggae and, of 
course, driving rock and roll. 

There's something special 
about David lindley; he can 
really pIa y rock and roll. 
Tomorrow night from 4~ 7 
pm, he'll be playing it here for 
the T.O.
