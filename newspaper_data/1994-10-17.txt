A PLUCKY PERFORMANCE UCSD Rejects 
Border Center 
at Last Minute 
RESEARCH: Atkinson kills 
project 24 hours before press 
conference with Janet Reno 

By FrMClsco DeVri .. 
Senior Staff Writer 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson abruptly pulled-
out of a federally funded border technology 
research center late last week after months of 
high-level lobbying to win the grant. 

Atkinson made the decision less than 24-
hours before Attorney General Janet Reno 's 
planned announcement of the joint UCSD and 
Department of Justice project at a campus press 
conference. 

The reversal came after senior members of 
the UCSD administration enlisted heavy-duty 
support from local and national political leaders 
to help bring the research center to the campus. 

United States Attorney Alan Bersin and Rep. 
Lynn Schenk had both lobbied extensively for 
the university. 

The sudden turnaround was a result of last-
minute concerns about the possible political 
fallout and the lack of adequate time to debate 
the proposed center, according to Dean ofGradu-
ate Studies and Vice Chancellor of Research 
Richard Attiyeh. 

Many faculty members also raised strong 
objections about the apparent law-enforcement 
focus of the research proposal.

'e .. k Requests Student 
RIMAe F ... Be Reduced 'ETCETERA. • • 
RECREATION: A.S. President also formally asks 
university to increase faculty and staff fees 

CALVIN a HOBBES by·Bill Watterson 

By ElaIne C .... .., 
Senior Staff Writer 

Associated Students President 
Carla Tesak continued her fight 
against the faculty and staff fee for 
the RecreationaV Intramural Ath-
letic Complex (RIMAC), formally 
requesting a reversal of the current 

tion Fee Committee's SU million 
budget, which already finances Stu-
dent Health and Career Services, 
will be used. 

Tesak initially appealed to Cam-
pus Recreation Director Chuck 
Gormley, who is in cbarge of the 
RIMACfacility, to adjust the RIMAC 

fee structure from the 
Registration Fee 
Committee. 

[n addition to the 
$12.50 recreation fee 
currently charged to 
students, the R[MAC 
funding mechanism 
mandates a $10 per 
quarter fee for its 
maintenance and op-
eration once the fa-
cility opens . The 
Campus Recreation 
Department decided 
to charge $50 per 
quarter for staff and 
faculty, and $15 per 
quarter for university 
non-affiliates last 
summer. 

Tesak asked the 
Registration Fee 
Committee to pro-
duce a statistical 
study and determine 
a new fee structure. 

"My probl ......

over the 

fees. At the A.S. 
Council meeting 
two weeks ago, 
Gormley said that 
the staff and fac-
ulty fee must be 
lower than the stu-
dent fee to remain 
competitive with 
local fitness facili-
ties. 

"'We need to 
keep the people 
that we have buy-
ing rec cards and 
we need to attract 
more," Gormley 
said. "'[Charging] 
$50 will net us 
more money in my 
opinion than if we 
charge more."

"My problem at 

this point in time [is 
that] the decision has 
been made so arbi-
traril y ," Tesak said. 
"It didn't go through

Committee. It was 
made over the sum-

Gormley em-
phasized the ne-
cessity of attract-
ing staff and fac-
ulty, whose fees 
will help cover the 
deficit. 

"What you are

staff and faculty 
fee] is net money

IRIPS Dean to Lecture on Japan 
adequate 
student Input." 

~ Teuk to you for money," 
Gormley said to A.S. Predident 

tively prohibited even 
adequate student input," she added. 

With an estimated $111,000 defi-
cit projected for the facility in re-
serve funding, money is desperately 
needed for RIMAC maintenance. 
The budget shortfall stems from a 
drop in student enrollment at UCSD, 
the main source of revenue for 
RIMAt. 

RIMAC's two other income 
sources are the faculty-and-staff rec-
reation fee, and the sports facilities 
department, which generates out-
side revenue from cheerJeading and 
sports camp programs held at UCSD. 
If the two outlets cannot make up for 
the deficit, funds from the Registra-

the council. 
Tesak said facility planners 

should have provided for the possi-
bility of a drop in student enroll-
ment, instead of relying on student 
fees for the funding of key factors 
such as maintenance. 

If the lesser faculty fee is neces-
sary to attract the optimum number 
of users, Tesak said students should 
be given evidence to assure them 
that the fee ratios are the most ben-
eficial for the support of RlMAC. 

"'My one point is the students 
should make this decision based on 
evidence, not on the arbitrary busi-
ness sense .of a member of the ad-
ministration," she said.

developing border-related tech-

Faculty concern stemmed, in

Moran declined to comment on

"Wewould not have known about

broken, " Hellmann said. "We had a 
geotechnical expert look at the site 
and the water may have exacerbated 
it" 

To repair the problem, Moran 
Construction injected a mixture of 
concrete and slate into the gaps, a 
repair process called "'pressure

pleted Ioc:ker room areas, in the re-
pair effort. Hellman said that the 
ongoing repairs are concurrent with 
the facility's completion, so no ad-
ditional delays are expected. 

"The problems should be com-
pleted by November," HeUmann 
said. "'Sometime around the first of 
December, everything should be

oocupied." 

While the structural impact of 
the linking soil appears to be minor, 
the fiscal impact upon students is 
still in question. Hellmann said he 
remains optimistic and predicts that 
the cost of the repairs will be "trans-

parent" to students. 
"'I believe there are some provi-

sions in the contract that if [UCSD] 
discovers defective work, [Moran] 
has to fix ii," Hellmann said. "An-
other option is that [UCSD] can do 
the work and charge it back to the 
contractor. " 

RIMAC is one of the Moran 
Construction Company's last 
projects before they cease opera-
tions in California. Nine months into 
the project's construction, Moran 
notified UCSD of its intent to leave. 

"To be honest, the reason for the 
current delay (in RIMAC's open-
ing] is that the contractor is slow," 
Hellmann said. "[Moran] had fallen 
behind because it rained for the first

Hellmann said that RIMAC has 
been a tough project because of its 
size and complexities, bul that "Once 
[RIMAC) is done and operational,l 
think students will really like it." 

Inilial rumors about the athletic 
complex may have exaggerated the 
extenl of the damage to the facility. 

A source from UCSD's police 
department, who asked to remain 
anonymous said, "RlMACwassink-

4 OPINION 

Unraveling the 
paradox of 
defining art 

nepisodeofM1V'soomedysbow, 
"The State," opens with a tidional, 

talk-show segment whose bast 
introduces his 'intellectually 

elite' guests, seemingly there for some yet-undisclosed 
roundtable discussion on some super-relevant issue of the day. 
The host uks ORe of his guests, "What is art?" 

A guest, after casually musing for a moment, answers in an 
hyper~ tone, "Ulte paintings and stuff." The show UllCX-
pcctedly encb, leaving the viewer hanging from I cliff of 
philosophical query. 

Superseding the humor in that sketch, however, is the 
inteUectuaI proposition with which it plays: the aU-folHtan-
dud paradox usocilted with attempIS at sIrictIy defining art, 
and the resultant inability to reduce art to a primary -a whole 
which can be defined by its parts. 

Nature has often been co .. idered the irredua'ble primary. 
People lived with a superstitious fear of it, maintaining an awe, 
rooted specificaJJy in ignol'lJlOe. 

Today's trepidation toward art analysis issimillr. Its exami-
nation and interpretation is said to be "in the eye of the 
beholder." 

Conceptual primaries, or absolutes, begin when: the human 
ability tooonceive ends. However, art is I function and product 
of I sentient being, and is therefore reducible. 

Proponents of art as an irreducible primary must propound 
the idea that the human mind functions in an haphazard 
manner. However, because any oonscious product of the 
human mind necessitates a mechanical mental progression, 
art can be defined on the grounds of psycho-epistemological 
thought. 

At:cording to Ayn Rand in 1M Romantic Mani/eslO, 
"".the study of human cognitive processes form the aspect 
of the interaction between the oonscious mind and the 
automatic functions of the suboonscious. " 

Art can be reduced to three criteria: its execution

COMMENTARY: While lamenting the inbusion of government in our lives, Michael Huffington 
wants to force our children to pray in school 

A FIGMENT OF HIS MONEY'S IMAGINATION 
IIJ FnIn .... o DeVJlee 
Senior sr." Writer 
. Multimillionaire Michlel 
Huf6ngIonissteadfut in hisdetermi-
nation to do abIolutely nothing for 
CtIifomia if eIeded to the Senate. He 
is so proud ofbis ability to do nothing 
that he bu made his inefficiency and 
incompeteocethe lindlpinofhiscam-
paign. 

Huftington's entire life has been 
OReof underachicvemcntand inoom-
petence, culminating with two stu-
pendous years of doing absolutely 
nothing u I congressman from Santa 
Barbara. Now, he apparendy feels 
that he needs more office space to do 
nothing for another six years in the 
government's employ. Except when 
the govemmentis forcing young chil-
dren to pray to God before class, he 
believes government.should stay out 
of our lives. All spending is pork, and 
as for new laws - well, he thinks we 
just have too many of them as it is. 

All of his JRvious bosses and 
coworkers agree that Huffington is 
remarkable in his ability 10 do noth-
ing. "') don't quite understand why he 
ran •.• ," aformeroongressional staffer 
mused. "It's like he didn't want to 
participate." 

In Congress, he only introduced 
three real bills, nol1C of which he 
pushed out of oommittee. California 
and Sanll Barbara officials have of-
ten turned to Senator Feinstein for 
help when Huffington's office re-
fused to do anything. 

Out ofpure frustration, Huflington 

On. October ~ ...... 

aides have been quitting in droves, 
ICXX)rding to the UIlioft-TriJJuM. 

Huffington proudly admits to this 
reoord of failure, and promises more 
of the same if he witw in November. 

His previous government experi-
encecame IS deputy assistant defense 
secretary for international relatiotw-
a position he bought with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in oontn'butiotw 
10 the Republican Party. Originally, 
then-Vi<:e President Bush had gotten 
him the nomination to I high post in 
the Commerce Department only 10 be 
foR:ed to withdraw it when he found 
out that Huffington's oompany had 
shipped shock batom, bandcuffs and 
other police-state equipment inlo In-
donesia - I brulll authoritarian re-
gime. The company was heavily fined 
heavily for its indiscretion. 

At the Penllgon, he made a quick 
impression on his superiors. "Mike 
brought no expertise in the lrea and 
evinced no particular willingness to 
master the details Ind work at the sub-
ject miner. Therefore, he was essen-
tially irrelevant," said his' boss Frank 
Gaffney, an ardent Reagan supporter. 

Huffington responded to the criti-
cmmby saying that Gaffuey just "wasn't 
interested in getting to know me." 

As for his vaunted and much-ad-
mired business career, it is a mixed 
bag It best. According to George 
Berko, who was I bigwig in the com-
pany, by the time Huffington, Jr. took 
over for his dad, -aU the risk was out 
of it The cull machine was flowing 
fruitfully when he came along." 

• 

the room full of 
journalists was 
shockedlnto 
sll ...... 
Hufflqton, who .... 
spent over $10 
million on his 
campalp, appeared 
to refer to the 
alml.., dollar .. 
~ Holy Father. 

What he did do, however, WlSspend 
tens of mmio .. of dollars in a fliled 
attempt 10 diversify the oornpany into 
tbe Houston reaI-estate market. 

H Huffington's JII1SI is remarkable 
only in its lack of subsaance, his plln 
for the future stays true 10 form. Last 
week, he boldly propOsed his sub&tan-

rive and reasoned llrltegy for treating 
our nation's ills. He proclaimed, quite 
seriously, that what ouroountry needs 
is for more people to worship God. It is 
simply not enough to talk about values 
Ind flmilies, he said, we must make 
God the basis of our social policy. 
And, he .nnounced the following day, 
the best way to start this spiritual re-
vivil is by forcing school children 10 
pray every morning before class. 

This is I fascinating concept from a 
man who is running for Senate on the 
promise to go to Washington 10 reduce 
the intrusion of government into our 
lives. Then: is virtually nothing more 
sacred to our personal freedom than 
our constitutional right to not be c0-
erced into practicing religion. 

Huffington has promised to lead 
the charge to change the Constitution 
so that the government can mandate 
prayer in school. The Supreme Court 
has oonsistently ruled that it is just tbis 
type of government interference in our 
spiritual lives the Founding Fathers 
were tryingloavoid. Forced prayer not 
only contradicts bis talk about "Big 
Govemment," it's a useless idea. The 
Pledge of Allegiance-type recitation 
which Huffington has proposed, would 
be as effective in instilling morals into 
people as the Pledge of Allegiance is in 
making young people patriotic. It 's 
not IS if his prayer-in-school idea fits 
into Iny Ilrger pi In to educate 
America's youth. Prayer is it. That's 
his plan fordealingwithourproblems. 

Hungry people walkingthe streets? 
We should pray. Kids bringing Uzis 10 

school? We should pray. T'bose S.A. T. 
averages fall again? We should pray. 

To avoid forcing Christianity on 
impressionable, young school chil-
dren, Huffington has suggested that 
the prayer be worded to include all 
gods and not just God of the Christian 
variety. When asked It a recent press 
oonference just what this God-<>f-all-
religio .. would be, Huffington pulled 
out a doUar bill and proudly announced 
"The God I'm talking about... is the 
one right here." 

The room fun of journalists was 
shocked into silence as Huffington, 
who has spent over $10 million on his 
campaign, appeared to refer to the 
almighty dollar as the Holy Father. 
After a pause, Huffington explained 
that he was, in fact, referring to the " I n 
God We Trust" inscnption on U.S. 
currency. But the Freudian slip was 
interesting nonetheless. 

Whether anyone likes it or not, the 
way Congress works is baving elected 
representatives which look out for the 
state. When our government is going 
to invest in schools, we need someone 
to push for that money to be spent here 
and not in South Dakota. It might be 
flawed, but it's all we've got. 

Huffington is uninformed, hypo-
critical, deceitful and inoompetenl. 
He is well on his way to redefining the 
exact opposite of our ideal public ser-
vant, and all the while boasting about 
just the qualities that make him so iII-
suited to be in charge of anything. 

Luckily,.:omeNovembcr, we have 
a choice.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian ....... y, Oetoher 17,1994 

MINORITY OF STUDENTS VOTED FOR RIMAe 
EdItor: 

Even the most eloquently ex-
pressed views become meaningless 
when not accompanied by the proper 
actions. AS. President Carla Tesak 
may have coul'lgCOusly attacked the 
unfairfee policy sunounding RIMAC 
("Thumbs Down to the AS. Coun-
ciL," Oct. 6), but such action is no 
more than political posturing. 

Her renunciation to the situation 
("It seems like whenever there is an 
enor, students are used to patch it up") 
may have drawn sympathy from many 
students, but her cynicism only adds 
salt to old wounds, and no student is 
any better off. 

Tesak does not seem to have iden-
tified the real problem with R1MAC. 
Petitioning that faculty and staff pay a 
fairer share for R1MAC membership, 
on a voluntary basis, does not solve 
the problem for thousands of students 
who must still cough up $210 per 
year, whether they use the facility or 
not. The real problem rests in solving 
what got us into this mess in the first 
place. 

In 1989, the $33.5 million R1MAC 

STANDARD: 
Critics can judge art by 
analyzing its elements 
ContInued from pce 4 
movements in art, create new genres 
and maximize their artistic potential. 

So, how does one strike the bal-
ance between derivativeness and pure-
ness in order to determine whether it 
is art or thievery? 

The artist is the individual who

ity (51.3 percent) of the 21.4 percent 
of the student body which showed up 
to vote on the issue. 

This mUM the referendum for 
R1MACpuscdwhenonly 10.98 per-
cent of the entire student body fa-
vored it, 10.42 percent rejeted it and 
78.6 percent did not even vote on the 
issue! 

This is even more disturbing when 
you oonsiderthequestionable mecha-
nisms used to draw in the votes, such 
as poUing locations outside the Main 
Gym and inside the Canyonview ath-
letic center, desaibed by the GUDI'd-
iJJn as "obviously ideal locations to 
attract sports-minded students." In 
other words, a small, special-interest 
group decided the fate of a multi-
million dollar project and left us to 
pay the biU. 

RlMAC should not have been ap-
proved when only a .56 percent mar-
gi n favored it. 

I am not very familiar with the 
process involved in approving a ma-
jor project like R1MAC, but it is clear 
that a voting mechanism needs to be

Self-professed artists who believe 
they just "feel" what they create - as 
opposed to thinking abOut it-could 
be creating anti-art, or may simply be 
misperceiving theirown expertise and 
prolificness. 

However, for such legitimate art-
ists, their aaft has become second 
nature.

RIMAe WIll Replace 
Mupr Wel&ht Rooms 
EdItor: 

Tedd Ladd wrote an article ISm 
why RIMAC was built ("A 
RimoIL'llrouS Mistake," Oct. 10). In 
particular, he claims there is no need 
for a larger or better weight room on 
this campus. This is false. 

Two of the weight rooms have 
such a limited variety of equipment 
(from no free wights in the Main Gym 
to a dearth of cabled machines in 
Spanos), that they are of little use 
when it comes to even a moderately 
active, bodybuilding program. Thus, 
there is really only one weight room to 
oonsider: Canyonview. 

a1ity). 
The experience becomes more 

passive. Such a progression is not 
inherendy corrupt; it is just less inspi-
rational and more deprivational. 
-"""" •• CrItIc 

Under such a paradigm, what is 
the role of the critic? The aitic is not 
a pawn at the mercy of trends nor of a 
pretentious subjectivist. 

Given this definition of art - not 
to be confused with a person's indi-
vidual tastes - it is clear that an 

Canyonview is often crowded. 
Even when empty, it seems crowded 
because there is 100 much equipment 
for the small building in which it is ' 
housed. A larger space is needed to 

. bold theequipmentcumntly in use at 
Canyonview. 

Some of the equipment also needs 
to beduplK:aaed. Canyonview hlsonJy 
one squat rIdt. Since the decline and 
incline benches do not have attached 
bar ncb, the squat J'IIdc must be used 
for that, too. Even without this extra 
load, one squat, a rickety one at that, is 
too few. 

In addition, new equipment is 
needed. There are several pieces of 
equipment which a gym should have. 
A Smith machine and a hip sled are 
the minimum. We should also have a 
seated calf machine, a standing leg-
curl machine, incline and decline 
benches with attached bar racks, a 
rear-delt machine and a standing-le-
vered ..;~ machine. 

This campus is genuinely in need 
of a larger weight room with better 
and more equipment.

critics. 

There is no art paradox, and we 
are not bound by the subjectivist's 
cliche, "art is in the eyes of the be-
bolder." The intellectual elites' be-
lief that art isanirmlucibleprimary is 
erroneous. 

Art must be broken down to its 
elements, to prevent it from being 
contrived as merely "paintings and

BORDER: 
UCSD abruptly turns 
down federal grant 
ContInued .......... 3 
political debate about illegal immi-
gration. 

"Given the campaign rhetoric," 
Atti)'eh said, "[there was concern] 
that our involvement in this would 
be l1.!isinterpreted." 

According to Academic Senate 
Chair and Biology Professor Nicho-
las Spitzer, the research center pro-
posal bad "raised the hackles of a 
number of my Senate colleagues," 
because of its apparent focus on law 
enforcement. 

Spitzer, who chaired an ad hoc 
Senate committee to examine the 
proposed federal grant last week, 
said the group tried to separate some 
of the NU's law enforcement as-
pects but did not have eoough time 
to fi nd a suitable compromise. 

Spitzer said many faculty mem-
bers were interested in researching 
ways to make border crossing more 
efficient and in the "promotion of 
good interactions across the bor-
der," but most did not want to pur-
sue a law enforcement agenda. 

According to Associate Chan-
cellor Ted Groves, one of the most 
important factors in theChancellor's 
rejection of the grant was that fac-
uity did not have sufficent time to 
examine the proposal. 

"The administration doesn't dic-
tate research to people," Groves said, 
adding tbat the decision to reject the 
project was made even before the 
Senate committee had met to debate 
the proposal. 

UCSD's rejection of the project 
came as a big disappointment to 
U.S. Attorney Alan Bersin, accord-
ing to Senior Counsel for the U.S. 
Attorney Phil Halpern. Bersin had 
been key to the conception of the 
idea and deeply involved in the 1ob-
bying effort, Halpern added. 

The university's rejection of the 
center was surprising, Halpern said, 
considering that over the summer 
"the university gave the impression 
that they were very interested." 

Halpern said UCSD's objections 
are "misguided" and came "from a 
complete lack of understanding" of 
the proposed center. 

He said the Border Patrol is "us-
ing ] 9th century techniques to cap-
ture 20th century criminals. " The 
research center would focus on de-
veloping new technology to stop 
a wide variety of border related 
crimes and to increase the efficiency 
of legal transit across the border, he 
added. 

Such research is not sp'ccifically 
directed to counter illegal immigra-
tion, said Halpern, but is actually 
"necessary to ensure legal immigra-
tion." 

Items such as the high-voltage 
water pistol and the restraini ng foam 

The UCSD CuardiaD 

were "nowhere on our drawing 
board," Halpem said, but that such 
non-lethal methods of apprehend-
ing fleeing criminals is a good area 
for research. 

Bersin will continue to pursue 
the development of a borderresearch 

. technology center elsewhere in San 
Diego, according to Halpern. "This 
idea is one wbose time has come," 
he said. 

Halpern 's sentiment was echoed 
by Congresswoman Lynn Schenk's 
Chief of Staff Laurie Black. 

"We're disappointed and we're 
going to go look for another loca-
tion," she said. 

UCSD originally contacted 
Schenk's office over the summer 
for assistance in winning the federal 
subsidy, Black added. 

Senate Chair Spitzer said that, 
despite its objections to this pro-
posal, the faculty is interested in 
shedding the "ivory tower" image 
and becoming more involved in the 
public sphere. 

"There is an enormous amount 
of expenise [here ~ndJ the un iver-
sity should play an important role in 
the public sector," he said. 

As for the border center project, 
Spitzer said that it might have been 
possible to work out a suitable agree-
ment, although it would have been a 
difficult process 

" I'd like to think we 'd find a 
middle ground ... but it was going to 
be a challenge," Spitzer said.

The complaint allO takes issue 
with the reinsurance demands of the 
depubnenL 

Riley asked CSAC 10 pay $62.6 
million in reinsurance claims .fter it 
wuoverdue in paying lender claims 
payments. 

CSAC spokesman Dans Calliban 
said thai once a .tudent defaults on 
• loan, CSAC acts as a guarantee 
agent and pays the lender the re-
maining balance on the lou. 

"The lender submits claims for 
payment 10 us, we pay beck those 
lenden in 90 day •. If their records 
are in order, the Department of Edu-
cation pay. us for what we pay [the 
lenders]." 

Callihan added that the $62.6 
million originated from claims 
which were paid after the 90 day 
limit. . 

If c:laima are not paid on time, 
additio .... interest must be paid by 
the guarantor. 

Accordinllo the complaint filed, 
the Iate-Ienderc:laim payments were 
caused by the budget stalemate dur-
ing the summer of 1992 and six 
months of computer problems while 
CSAC switc:hecI systems in 1993. 

Despitethe~lems,CSACc:1aims 
it repaid all interest owed 10 the 
Department of Education. 

1'be complaint states that, "CSAC 
voluntarily paid tbe secretary the 
full amount that tbe secretary had 
paid for interest accrued beyond the 
90 days .fter CSAC received tbe 
claims from lenders. 

"The federal government suf· 
fered no fiscal damage from the 
January to July 1993 late· lender 
c:laim payments," the complaint 
added. 

Mismanagement, computer-sys-
tem failure and reinsurance claims 
are not tbe onl y points of contention 
between tbe Department of Educa· 
tion and CSAC. 

The Department of Education 
found that the commission over· 
stated its portfolio of outstanding 
loans by $1.5 billion since 1978, 
ac:c:ording to an audit the depart· 
ment conducted late last year. 

Callihan dismissed the claims 
and said that the conduct of the audit 
wu questionable. "Both the com-
mission and tbe accounting firm of 
De Loitte and Touche concluded 
thai the methodology WIS ... 
flawed," he said. 

"You have to be careful about 
how you draw the data base. We're 
working With the Department of 
Education to clear some of these 
issues," Callihan added. 

CSAC claims thaI it would suf-
fer "irreparable injury," ifforcecl to 
pay Ihe $62.6 million, because tbe 
commission has made agreements 
witb its lenders tbal its reserves will 
not rail below one pcrcent of tbe 
aggregateamountofil<; unpaid prin· 
clpal and interest. 

"Because CSAC would be in 
default on its agreemenas ~th the 
lenders, Ihe lenders could tllen with- , 
draw from tbe loan program. Witb-
out lenders, CSAC would be un-
able to fulftll the very purpose of 
the guaranteed loan program -
i.e, 'to provide a source of loans to 
help students meet the costs of 
hiaher educalioD, '" the COIDJIlis. 
sica stated. 

However, Callihan Uid that stu-
den.. were under no immediate 
threat .

If./iLderne& Orientation lMeJ the 
outback to guiJecJtudentJ to UCSD 

Muirfirst-yearstudent Kim Brown 
had been alone in the middle of the 
forest for hours. It was beginning to 
get dark as she put down the journal in 
which she had been feverishly writ-
ing. Sitting back, she watched the sun 
disappear below the horizon and the 
stars rise slowly in the night sky. 

Brown hadn't eaten anythingor seen 
another person since breakfast, and she 
knew that she would be all alone until 
the next morning. 

Strangely, though, Brown said she 
wasn't worried. 

"I thought I'd 
be freaked out ... 
[but] I became re- F 
ally comfortable. _.---
It didn't bother 
me," she said. 

Eventually, when morning came, a 
UCSD Wilderness Orientation leader 
picked her up and brought her back to 
camp, where she and a dozen other 
soon-to-be UCSD students were 
greeted with breakfast. 

Everyone sat around quietly eating 
and reflecting on their 24 hours alone 
in the woods. Somehow passing Math 
2A, meeting new dorm roommates and 
navigating the huge campus just didn't 
seem as difficult or frightening as it 
once had. 

This, according to UCSD Wilder-
ness Orientation Director Robyn 
Cummins, is the whole point. 
tile .... 

The UCSD Wilderness Orientation 
prognm began, in its current form, 
four years ago. It's purpose is take 
incoDling UCSD students into the 
outback for, as the program's recruit-
ment brochure proclaims, an "intro-
duction to the wilderness as well as the 

college environment." 
The result is part backpacking trip, 

part college-prepcourse and part new-
age spiritual revival. 

Thissummer, almost l00500n-to-
be students got their first glimpse at 
the college experience, not from a 
dorm room, but from a small camp-
site 12,000 feet up a mountsin. 

On each trip, about a dozen stu-
dents, along with three orientation 
leaders, spend a week and a half in the 
wild, learning backpacking basics, 
climbing skills and perhaps a bit about 

what to expect in col-
lege. 

According to 
Cummins, partici-

pants walk away 
from the trip a with "a lot 

better experience on how to deal with 
living with strangers. Maybe the)' are 
a little more open minded [and] a 
little bit more ready to deal with the 
challenges ahead because they had to 
deal with the challenges of surviving 
in the wilderness." 

And perhaps best of all, no one bas 
ever been eaten by a bear.

The journey begins with a Wil-
derness Orientation brochure which 
arrives in incoming students' mail 
boxes early ill the summer. Inter-
ested students send for the offICial 
application and fork over $369 -
which covers everYthing on the Si-
erra excursions except personal 
camping equipment and transporta'-
tion to UCSD. The Baja California 
Kayak trip, added this year, costs 
$100 more. The Wilderness Orienta-
tion also offers three grants each

not 
the trip. 

Once in the wil-
derness, little time is 
wasted. After a half-day of basic 
backpacking instructions at the 
trailhead, the group sets off to race 
the challenges of the backcountry. 
Many participants say the first half-
day of hiking is the roughest. 

Though Brown said that she 
thinks just about anyone can physi-
cally handle the trip, it isn't always 
easy. 

"The first day my backpack was 
really heavy .... 1 mean I'd faU over it 
was 10 heavy, -. ahe said. "It was re-
ally demanding. It was a challenging 
trip.-

Later, however, most of the stu-
dents on the Eastern Sierra trip seemed 
to adjust to the rigorous hiking and 
fall into a rhythm, she added. 

The next day is spent climb-
ing a rock. Most students 
have never done any tech-
nical rock climbing so 
the climb is kept 
fairly easy, but,

TRIP: Students 
emotional after 
'24-hour solo' 
CoIItInued ......... 10 
according to Cummins, "the reason 
for doing rock climbing isn't neces-
sarily [for) learning how to rock 
climb." 

Clinging to a rock 30 feet above 
the ground with your only safety net 
being a rope held by someone who 
you've known only 48 hours can be 
a scary experience - for both the 
climber and the person holding the 
rope. It is an experience which helps 
people de~elop trust and self-confi-
dence, Cummins explained. 

After a day of climbing, the group 
is back on the tnil again, pushing its 
way up to a mountain pass. Battling 

. fatigue and altitude sickness -the 
pass is usually around 12,000 feet 
- these hikes are often challenging 
for students, Cummins said. 

From the pass, the group leaves 
its backpacks ~hind and heads for 
one of the trip's highlights - the 
peak ascent. The mountain peaks 
avenge around 14,000 feet and of-
fer spectacular views of the sur-
rounding area. 

At the top, there is often a time 
capsule which contai ns journals with 
entries from others who have 
climbed the mountain. The students 
leave their own messages, and pause 
for a photo and a Snickers bar before 
heading down. 

For Brown, the peak ascent was 
the best part of the trip Besides the 
incredible view, Brown said that 
making it all the way up gave her a 
sense of real accomplishment. 

"I had never climbed a mountain 
before," she said_ 
........ -

Because of abe rough terrain and 
hip altitudes, accidents and alti-
tude sickness are a constant con-
cern on the trips. While there have 
never been any serious or Iife-
threatening accidents, altitude sick-
ness is common, since the entire 
trip takes place between 10,000 and 
14,000 feet. 

Altitude sickness usually entails 
shortness of breath and dizziness, 
but can also cause vomiting and 
othersymptoms which require bring-
ing the person down to a lower alti-
tude to acclimate. In more serious 
cases, the hiker must be evacuated 
from the mountain completely. 

Acutely aware of the dangers 
of the outback, all Wilderness Ori-
entation leaders are required to 
have training in emergency medi-
cal treatment. According to 
Cummins, most leaders have the 
backcountry equivalent of an 
Emergency Medical Technician 
certification, known as a Wilder-
ness First Responder. rw...,.,., 1IoIn ...... 

For many, the most intimidating 
part of the trip is not the possible 
dangers, heavy packs and long miles, 
or even the rigorous ascent to a 
14,000-foot peak, but the prospect 
of spending 24 hours alone in the 
forest. 

According to Cummins, the "24_ 
hour solo" often conjures up im-
ages of Rambo plunging through 
the underbrush or some survivalist 
group training for life after the 
apocalypse. 

The reality is much more tame

physically, but is often students ' 
most memonble experience on the 
trip. 

For the 24-hour solo, each stu-
dent is placed in a secluded area 
well away from the main campsite 
with little or no food. Fasting is 
encounged, but not required. 

Confi ned to a small area, usually 
not much larger than a living room, 
the soloist is alone with his or her 
thoughts and the wilderness for 24 
hours. With no meals to structure 
time, no televi~ion to watch and no 
friends to call on the telephone, par-

ticipants have little to do but think 
and write in their journals. 

Brown said she Ieamed a lot about 
herself in those 24 hours. "I don't 
think I'd ever ... spent a 24-hour 
period alone with no distractions," 
she said. 

According to Cummins, that is 
why the 24-lIour solo exists. "It's a 
good time for them to think about 
their life, how it's been and [how] 
they want it to be in the future," she 
said. 

In the morning, the leaders walk 
to each individual hamlet to pickup 
the soloists. Few are unchanged by 
the experience. 

"Everyone was a litlle quiet. They 
were shocked, basically, by being 
by themselves for that long. It was 
really spiritual," Brown said of her-
self and her fellow campers. 

After eating some of the large 
breakfast prepared by the orienta-
tion leaders, people start to discuss 
the experience. Cummins, Brown 
and Orientation LeaderTom Nusser 
all found that the group was particu-
larly open and emotional after the 
solo. 

"Each person tells a little bit about 
their experience within the ... 24 
hours, and that, in most cases, is an 
extremely bonding experience," 
Cummins said. 
"-Inc Connections 

Although the solo might spark 
intense emotion, it is not the only 
time on the trip students open up to 
one another. 

"We were really open with each 
other [throughout the trip]," Brown 
said. "We felt really bonded. Really 
bonded." 

Orientation leacJers work hard to 

FEATURES 11 

foster an environment of honesty. 
According to Brown, her leaders' 
efforts were successful. The leaders 
"were great. 1 think that was what 
made everyone click," she said. 

On Brown's trip, a game called 
"Yes or No" brought out "a lotemo-
tionally fora lot of us .... We sat and 
we cried for a while and that really 
brought us together." 
A FrIend ............ 

It is this type of experience that 
forms friendships which make the 
first few days at college less scary. 

"It is kind oflike having a family 
here," Brown said. "Some people 
you can always turn to, always talk 
to. " 

Nusser, who did the program as 
an incoming student in 1991, said 
that having friends located all over 
campus was important for him, 
even if the friendships didn ' t al-
ways last. 

"You reall y get to know 10 people 
pretty well in 10 days in the 
woods .... Afterward, it sometimes 
fades a little bit just because people 
are a lillIe bit different once they get 
back in the front-country. It 's still a 
good starting point," he said. 

But the importance of the trip is 
difficult for Nusser to explain. "Once 
you've sort of had that experience, 
it 's really hard to share it with some-
one else that hasn't," he said. 

Brown agreed, saying the trip 
was different than she expected. 

"When I signed up for the trip, I 
never thought that [this) was what 
[it] was going to be like," she said. 

Wilderness Orientation, which 
is a program of UCSD Outback 
Adventures, will hit the trail again 
next summer.

ADOPT-A-SCHOOL 
Realizing that positive 

rolemodelscanhavesuch 
a profound impact on 
elementary school 
children, UCSD Greeks 
have been openly 
welcomed at Doyle 

a.:='.7J Elementary School. For 
• three years, Greek men and 

women have volunteered their 
time, giving guidance and 
inspiration to these young and 
iDlpressi6nabie children. 

The goal of Adopt-A-School 
is to provide for the formation 
of one-on-one 
relationships 
between 
college 
students and 
I 0 c a I 
elementary 
school 
children. This 
program 
provides an 
opportunity 
for coUege students to give 
something back to their host 
communities by devoting their 
spare time to elementary school 
children. 

The San Diego Unified 
School Oistri(t has been 
adversely effected by recent 
budget cuts, and it is the 
c:hildI:en who suf£erthe greatest 

losses. Therefore, the program 
opens the door for college 
students to pitch in ~d make a 
difference in the life of a child. 

UCSD was selected three 
years ago as a pilot school in the 
implementation of this national 
program. ReachingouttoDoyle 
Flementarystudents proved not 
enough however. This year, the 
Greek community has adopted 
another school, Curie 
Elementary. Expanding the 
program will allow college 
students to serve as role models 

in the develop-
ment of even 
more children. 

The Greek 
Community 
has success-
fully bright-
ened the future 
of education 
for hundreds 
of children, 
and you can 

join the cause as weD. More 
volunteen are currently being 
recruited. Contact the 
Interfraternity Council or the 
Panhellenic Association for 
more details. 

Adopt-A-School is a 
foundatiOft for the future: a 
foundation worth nurturing 
and~ 

skills and qualities essential to 
building a strong and 
successful organization. Excel 
further provides a forum 
whereby participants of the 
conference can network with 
one another, allowing for 
interaction that enables aU to 
share their experiences as well 
as learn from others'. Excel is 
an event not to be missed. 

Excel Regional Leadership 
Conference will take place on 
Sunday, November 6th . 
Registration fees are $8.00 for 
UCSD students and faculty 
and $20.00 for Non-UCSD

DELUSIONS: 
Mauled by Moose 
ContInued hili ..... 24 
Perhaps, I thought with my big 
undefeated head, we belong with 
the bigger boys in " AA .. 

Then MOOIe and Co. came along 
to dellroy our delusions of grandeur. 
They IDckod our uses Convincingly. 
Our offeme couldn't move a yard, 
tbougll our defeme did. its best to 
make up for it by moving hundreds 
of yards - backward. 

In a word, we were out of our 
lcape. These guys were big. Their 
defensive line looked more like a 
mountain range than a bunch of guys 
playina a friendly pme of football. 
Once each play began, however, 
they proved tblt tbey were mucb 
quicker than a mountain range IS 
they consistently bowled over our 
offensive line and blitzed the OB. 
Moose al.o made it clear they 
weren't as interested in a friendly 
game of football as I was. 

After the game, I was angry. I 
decided the problem was not that we 
were out of our league, but that they 
were out of theirs. Everyone wants 
to win. 

lbat'. the name of the game. But 
I couldn't imagine these guys los-
ing to any "A" team, especially af-
ter seeing the two teams we bad de-
stroyed earlier in the seuon. If a 
team wants to gloat over its fallen 
opponents as MOOIe and Co. do, it 
does not belona in "A" Have some 
respect for genuine" A .. ams or get 
the beUout. 

What'. even more frightening is 
that next week we play I team which 
beat Moose and Co. last week. It 
appears our league is full of sand-
baggers, and thole fun Saturday af-
ternoons aren't 10 fun anymore. or 
course, my season', over anyway, 10 
I'll be watching the carnage from the 
safety of the sideline. 

POLO: Drop

ContInued hili ..... 17 

With IS seconds remaining in the. 
game, Lona Bcacb was sitting pretty 
witb a 14-12 advantage. 

The 4ge1l1ost a man to ejection, 
however. In the following seconds, 
the ball was immediately kicked out 
to Craig Gruber, who launched I 2-
point rocket tbat eluded Long 
Beach's goal tender, tyina it at 14. 

Surprisingly, neither team could 
find the net in the first overtime, and 
it was still knotted when time ex-
pired. 

In the second 0'1', UCSD scored 
first, but the 4gen responded with I 
two-pointer, then followed it with a 
goal from tbe two-meter hole posi-
tion. Again, Long Beach bad a man 
ejected. At the :40 mark, the Tritons 
looked as if they would tie it. Greg 
Salvinski almost managed to do so 
with a difficult two-pointer. 

"He looked It me, we communi-
cated. I told him to go to tile cage 
and score the immediate goal," 
Harper said. 

Salvinski did just that, and the 
Tritons were down by one with 30 
seconds left. They got it back at the , 
:12 mark, but could not find a good 
shot. The game ended witb a no-
chance half-tank shot. 

Gruber was stellar for the Tritons 
on offense, garnering five points, 
including a pair of two-point shots. 

"1bia could be [Gruber'. ] offen-
sive comina-out game," Harper said.

We SOCCER: 
Tritons tie the 
women of Troy, 0-0 
ContInued fIoIn .... 24 
IIhots in the fine half, the Tritons' 

. ofl'ense c:une alive after the intermis-
sion and slowly began to take con-
trol of tbe game . 

Fifteen minutes into the second 
half, the Tritons got one of their best 
scoring chances of the game after a 
USC foul. UCSD's Beth Freeburg 

received the ball off a penalty kick 
deep in the left comer. 

Freeburg dribbled to the right and 
tried I shot that bounced off a Tro-
jan defender and ricocheted high into 
the air. Peer, who was stationed near 
the center of the penalty box, saw 
the t.II falling and raced in all alone. 
BaclaaliICOO jumped.out of the box 
to make a play on the ball, but Peer 
got there fll'St. Unfortunately for the 
Tritons, Peer's header sailed wide 
left of the open goal. 

Ten minutes later, UCSD's Carin 

Pugh outran three USC defenders 
and was heading for the goal all 
alone when she was tackled from 
behind at the top of the box. Instead 
of I penalty tick, however, the ref· 
eree placed the ball one foot outside 
of the box. 

USC's beat opportunity to break 
the saaiemate came with 17 minutes 
to play in regulation. Trojan Allison 
Sbeuer got the t.II off a comer kick. 
five yanls outside of the box. She 
lofted a shot toward the left comer, 
wbere team mite Amy Peterson 
made a run at the goal. Peterson 
managed a header off Shearer's shot, 
but the ball flew over the bar. 

The first overtime was evenly 
played with neither team able to es-
tablish a solid scoriog opportunity. 

The second overtime was con· 
trolled by UCSD and featured its 
best opportunity of the game. With 
11 minutes to play, Pugh nailed a 
shot which bit the crossbar and 
bounced down. Badaglilcco dove 
for the ball but it squirted out to Ete 
Johnson at the right corner of the net. 
But before the Triton could put the 
ball into the pi, BadagJilCOO lOt 
up and stopped the shot 011 ber knees. 

USC was not the overwhelm-
ingly physical team the Tritons faced 
against Cal State Fullerton, but the 
Trojans were not shy about contact. 
The Trojans were whistled for 26 
fouls compared to only six for 
UCSD. All of the penalties did not 
atop the Tritons from outshooting the 
visitors, 11·9, however. 

"They were a lot weaker than I 
expected. They were strong on slc.ills 
but not as powerful. We could have 
won, but I think we're all still 
drained from the Fullerton game," 
Amanda Johnson said.

Normally, if a team lights up the 
scoreboard for 16 points in a water 
polo game, it can expect to tally a 
win. That is, unless the defense is 
on holiday, as it was for the Tritons 
in a 17·16 heartbreaking defeat to 
non·conference nemesis Long 
Beach State. 

"We just did not play well defen-
sively," Head Coach Denny Harper 
said. 

It is amazing how close the game 
was considering that the team came 
out of the gate lethargically. The Tri· 
tons were held scoreless in the first 

period and were down 7·2 in the 
middle of the second . 

"We were 100 tight [in the begin· 
ning]," Harpersaid. "We looked ncr· 
vous." 

UCSD started to wake up, and 
closed the gap to 7-4 by half·time. 
"Then the goals started to come like 
crazy," Harper said. 

The second half was I sec·saw 
battle with numerous lead changes . 
8y the end of the third, UCSD was 
up 9-8. The mutual lAck of defense 
became glaringly evident in tbe 
fourth, as the adversaries combined 
for 11 goals .

X-COUNTRY: 
UCSD punishes 
Balboa Invite field 
Conttnued ......... 22 

Karen Hinkle provided the greal-
est spark of lhe day, vaulting up to 
lhe second-place slol on the team 
with a 16th-place 19:49 mark. 

UCSD's Jessie Therriault, bow-
ever, was the bigat surprise. Side-
lined earlier in the week with an 
ankle injury, Therriault returned tri-
umphantly, taking the Triton's third 
leam spot with a 25lh-place 20:25 
time. . 

"(Therriault] did some supple-
mental training during the week," 
Van Arsdale ~ "She ended up run-
ning 29 seconds faster, despite the 
hurt ankle." 

Almost running side-by-side with 
Therriault were Tritons Melissa 

~berts (20:28) and long-time vet-
eran Jane Zimmerman (20:26), who 
sprinted to 27th- and 26th-place fin-
ishes, respectively. 

A flurry of UCSD athletes closed 
out the scoring on the women's side, 
as Liana Wright (20:34), Erica 
Nehrer (20:35) and Courtney Grey 
(20:38) slipped into lhe final three 
scoring spots for the Tritons. 

"[Wright] did extremely well. 
She has improved by over a minute 
within.the last month," Van Arsdale 
said. 

The UCSO men raced to an ex-
ceptional second-place finish in 
Saturday's festivities on the eight-
kilometer trail, despite a relatively 
poor performance by team standout 
U. Castner. 

UCSO finished second overall, 
just missing first place UC 
Riverside's 48 point tally, by a slim 
six-point margin. Southern Utah fell 
to third place with 80 team points . 

Castner did race to the forefront 
of lhe Trilon contingency, however, 
finishing 11th overall in 26:33. 
UCSO's Robert Ho (26:33), John 
Walsh (26:35) and Walter Dehority 
(26:36) were righl on Castner's 
heels, placing 13th, 14th, and 15th 
respectively. 

"Nate Johnson was my selection 
for Triton athletc-of-the-week," Van 
Arsdale said. "He was abroad all last 
year and he came back to take the 
fifth spot at Balboa [Invitational]. It 
was an incredible performance. He's 
the toughest distance runner I've 
seen all year." 

Johnson solidly placed himself as 
the fifth man for the Tritons with a 
27:03 time, 'a three-minute improve-
ment from his performance al the 
Aztec Invitalional earlier in the sea-
son. . 

Michael Bum's 27:08 earned him 
the sixth Spol in UCSO's rotalion-
a respectable, 23rd-place overall fin-
ish in a field of over 100 runners. 

"[Bums] has sbown a huge im-
provement," Van Aradale said. "Sat-
urday, he showed he's ready to race 
at this level." 

The seventh team spot belonged 
10 Goss Lindsay, wbo gallOped to a 
24th-place overall finish with a 
27:10 time. 

"I looked al Ihe [Balboa Invita-
lionaI] as a run-off to see who would 
move up in position on the team," 
Van Arsdale said. ' 

By entering 10 Triton women and 
14 Triton men in Saturday's enor-
mous field of runners, Van ArsdaJe 
used the results to evaluate the per-
formances of a number of his ath-
letes. 

"The only reason we're in the 
thick of the race [for fint in confer-
ence] is that we're ricin, well in a 
pICk, • Vu Andale said. -The con- , 
ferenec tide is up for JnbI. It be-

V-BALL: UCSD 
captures Invitational 
Continued from pac. 24 
the game (15-4) and close out the 
Warriors in straight sets. 

UCSD's balanced offensive at-
tack kept the pressure on all match 
long. Kristi Askeland and Jennifer 
Cross each pounded out seven kills 
from their middle-blocking slots 
while Crochet paced UCSD's posse 
of outside hitters with nine kills. 

The Triton's second game of the 
day was against NAIA foe Master's 
College. Master's scholarship ath-
letes managed to give UCSD a bit 
of trouble, but the Tritons prevailed 
in the end, earning a four-game vic-
tory over the Mustangs (15-2, 12-15, 
15-7, 15-10). 

The opening game was all UCSD 
in a dominating win. The Tritons, 
however, were unable to maintain 
their momentum into the second set 
of the matchup, and Master's evened 
the battle at one game apiece. 

The third game once again saw 
the Tritons surge to the forefront 
with strong ongoing performances 
by their outside hitters. Madelyn 
Ripken spent the afternoon pummel-
ing the Mustangs' defense into sub-
mission, tallying 15 kills and a .387 
hitting percentage. Crochet was also 
a powerful weapon for UCSD, 
smashing home 14 kills and contrib-
uting defensively with 12 digs. 

The ever-present Julie Harvey 
alsO played well on defense, com-
ing up with 14 digs to complement 
her eight kills. Junior defensive spe-
cialist Joyce Lee and Ripken each 

scrambled their way to nine digs. 
Their combined efforts led the Tri-
tons to a relatively narrow 15-10 tri-
umph in the fourth and final game. 

On Saturday morning, UCSD 
once again faced off against ECSU, 
which was given two shots at the 
highly ranked Tritons. UCSD again 
came out hot, taking a 10-1 lead in 
the opening game when setter Jen-
nifer Schofield put up a perfect 
backset to a soaring Ripken who 
blasted it down the heart of the War-
riors defense. 

The Tritons stumbled a bit, how-
ever, allowing ECSU to close within 
four points at 10-6 before regroup-
ing. Ripken finished out the game 
with a soft roll shot which dropped 
in front of a trio of sprawling ECSU 
defenders to give UCSD the 15-7 
victory. 

Game two was dominated by the 
Tritons who stormed out to an 11-2 
lead, and never looked back en route 
to a 15-3 triumph and a 2-0 advan-
tage in games. 

The third game was almost a car-
bon copy of the second with UCSD 
establishing an 11-2 margin and 
cruising to the win. The highlight of 
the contest came on match point, 
when Askeland, not known as a 
strong server, nailed a jump serve 
that the Warrion couldn't handle, 
giving the Tritons a 15-4 victory and 
bringing the bench pouring onto the 
court to congratulate her. 

That victory set up a showdown 
with Occidental. The TIgers dealt the 
Tritons their only loss to a Division 
III opponent earlier this year, when 
they surprised UCSD in a five-set 
marathon at Occidental. The Tritons

The UCSD Guardiau 

were fired up for the rematch, how-
ever, and were eager to prove that 
their earlier defeat was only a fluke. 

"The tournament was this matcb 
for us," Head Coach Doug Danne-
vik said. "For the first time tbis year 
[we played a team twice] and had a 
chMce to implement a game plan 
and challenge a team to stop us. " 

The Tigers were unable to meet 
the challenge as UCSD steam rolled 
them (15-4,15-6,15-10). 

Game one saw tbe Tritons sprint 
out to an 11-2 advantage. Askeland 
made one of her tbree solo blocks 
with the score locked at 13-4 to give 
the Tritons a game point. UCSD 
capitalized on a TIger passing error 
a few points later, to take a 1-0 lead. 

The Tritons' focus was contain-
ing Ocx:idental's main weapon, Mia 
Solmssen, who had 33 kills against 
UCSD in the early season matchup. 

"We blocked against her with just 
one person and relied on our other 
players digging," Dannevik said. 
"We dug her a lot and didn 't let her 
really catch fire." 

In game two, the Tritons came 
out smoking on offense, and before 
the Tigers knew what had hit them, 
UCSD was in possession of a 12-1 
lead. The Tritons relaxed a bit in the 
latter stages allowing Occidental to 
close the gap, but did not relinquish 
their lead, taking it 15-6 to get within 
a game of revenge. 

Early in the third set, the Tritons 
grabbed a 4-0 lead off a devastating 
spike from Crochet who flew in on 
the left side and blistered one 
through the block. Askeland ex-
tended the advantage to five by 
pounding an errant pass by Occiden-
tal into the floor. 

The TIgers regrouped late, how-
ever, tallying four straight points and 
threatening to make a game of it at 
13-10. But a big stuff by Askeland 
and Harvey and an error by Occi-
dental ended those hopes (15-10) 
and a perfect weekend for UCSD. 

auistine Chi and Crochet both 
made the all-toumament team for the 
Tritons, but by far, the best moment 
of the weekend came wben 
Schofield jumped to her feet to ac-
cept the MVP award. 

Schofield's performance (103 
assists and 10 aces) showed just how 
capable she is of leading the squad 
to victory in big matches. 

"[Dlnnevik] has made me a 
stronger player," Schofield said. "I 
feel a lot better about my skills and 
I'm a Jot more confident."

"We're going to be a more pow-
erful toam in November. No one 
cares about how we did in Septem-
ber races. People only care in how 
you do at regionals and nationals," 
Van Arsdale said. "And we're sprt-

00 

ing to peak at the right time. " 
Battling the fierce winds and 

drizzly conditions on s.turday, the 
Tritons refused to let the rain 
dampen their spirits. Instead, both 
UCSD men's and women's squads 
grabbed second place overall, virtu-
ally writing a 'How-to' book about 
racing in a pack. 

"The strength of the team truly 
is with the pack," Van Andale said. 
"Everybody has to run as one per-
son." 

The Triton women did just that, 
garnering 78 points en route to a 12-
point pummeling of cmu-town ri-
val University of San Diego, but fin-
ishing a distant second to Southern 
Utah University's 33 points. 

The undisputed leader of tbe 
UCSD women all season, freshman 
Kyndra Smith, led the way again 
with a 14th-place finish and a nifty 
19:43 time on the winding, five-ki-
lometer course.

The Tragedy of 
Sandbagging 

I once tbought that intramural 
football was all about fun and 
games. Grab some friends, put a 
team together, then go out and 
play. If you win, you give each 
other high fives and laugh as you 
bask in your glory. If you lose, 
you give each other high fives and 
laugh at your mistakes. Sure, 
"AAA" divisions are bound to get 
competitive and mean-spirited, 
even inore so than some NFL 
games. "A" divisions, however, 
are the realm of good-natured 
footballers. 

Or so I thought until Saturday. 
Early in the first half, reality 

came crashing down in the form 
of a rather large, somewhat 
frightening offensive lineman. It 's 
not very often that I get an 
opportunity to see stars so early in 
the afternoon. It's not an opportu-
nity I look forward to either. In the 
aftermath of the play, I wasn't 
quite aware of what was going on 
around me. After someone flicked 
the sun back on, one of my 
teammates summarized our 
opponents' conversation for me: 

OB: "Moose, was that you who 
laid him out?"

SCORING DROUGHT: UCSD and Trojans 
finish scoreless after 120 minutes of play 
By GreaWrenn 
Spotts l»Edltor 

It was the kind of soccer game 
which makes the sport's critics 
bowl: two full hours of play and 

not a single 
goal. But, in 
fact, the Tri-
ton women's 
soccer team's 
0-0 tie with 
visiting USC 
was much 
more interest-
ing than 
UCSD's 14-0 
dismantling of 

La Verne earlier this year. 
The Division I Trojans were 

expected to be one of the most 
challenging combinations of 
physical play and soccer skills 
UCSO would face all year. 

It turned out to be a game of 
missed opportunities, mostly for 
UCSO. Fifteen minutes into the 
game, the Tritons' Dawn Lee fired 

YIIMN ZtW1ltJtfN/~ a comer kick from the right side. 

head on the perfect cross, but the 
ball hit the crossbar and bounced 
harmlessly over the goal. 

Four minutes later, UCSO's 
Ele Johnson found Peer down the 
right sideline. Peer headed toward 
the goal, then looked inside for 
the crossing pass. The ball 
bounced off a defender and back 
to Johnson, who was trailing the 
play just inside the penalty box. 
Johnson launched a shot which 
oounced off of USC goalkeeper 
Laura Badagliacco. This time, 
Peer ended up with the rebound, 
but tbe ball was knocked out by a 
USC defender. 

The Trojans accomplished 
what few teams have been able 
to: They pinned UCSO deep in 
their own half of the field. USC 
was able to control the ball on 
offense for three or four minutes 
at a stretch several times during 
the game, giving the nonnally of-
fensive-minded Triton defense 
quite a workout. 

Moose: "Yeah!" [Moose grins.] 
OB: "Good job!" [OB and 

Moose share a laugh and give 
each other a high five.] 

Apparently, this conversation 
took place not too far from my 
still-prostrate body, so I should 
have heard it. Perhaps I didn't 
remember the conversation 
because of some sort of language 
barrier. After all, my teammates 
informed me that I was speaking 
Latin on the sideline for the next 
few minutes.

I had no business going back 
into the game, but once I was 
speaking intelligible English 
again, I ran back out there. It 's 
only " A," I reasoned, so what else 
could possibly happen to me? The 
answer was this: I could get my 
knee smashed and hobble around 
for the next few days with a 
season-ending injury. I foo lishly 
forgot this was a football game, 
not something less brutal, like a 
game of catch. After the season 's 
fi rst two weeks, the distinctions 
between these two pursuits 
seemed to blur. 

We were just out there having 
fun, playing" A" football. We 
hadn 't suffered a single injury on 
the field as wt: rulled over two 
opponents handily. So handily, in 
fact, I was beginning to wonder 
whether we were sandbagging.
