Muir Student Takes Bad UC Regents Approve Housing, 
Acid; Tra~:~G?!!-Campus 3rd Cost Jump; Reagan Attends 

An unidentified Muir student suffered a serious psychotic break-
down last week from what was apparently tainted LSD. 

Dean Jim Beckley reported that last week some bad acid was 
irculating in the dorms and that a student is seriously ill from the 

effects of the LSD. The student who suffered the breakdown is ex-
pected to be out of school for .quite some time. 

Beckley said the acid was obvious Iv laced with something dangerous 
to the human body. He encouraged all Muir students living in the 
dorms to dispose of any such drugs becausE' of the possibility of suf-
fering ill ffe ts . 

The tainted LSD was traced to an off-campus supplier. Earlier in th 
quarter there were reports of a person off the streets who had tried to 
deal some dangerous drugs to Muir students. Cocaine has also been 
found in Muir dormitories . According to 'Beckley, although many 
tudents think that there are no longer any problems with such drugs as 

co aine and LSD, ,th 10 ident last week should serve as a reminder 
that drugs still are an issue of con rn . 

The UC Regents Friday ap-
proved construction of a $4 
million "turnkey" apartment 
complex for UCSD, and rub-
berstamped a $270,000 jump in 
cost for the planned Third College 
residence halls. 

The meeting at Santa Barbara 
also saw Ronald Reagan attend 
his first Regents' meeting since 
October of 1973, and his last as 
'governor of California. 

The " turnkey" concept (see 
housing story this page) apart-
ments will be built ast of In-
terstate 5, near existing married 
student apartments . Campus 
planners hope to have th 
apartments built by September to 
meet increasing demand for on-
campus housing. 

The increase in funding for the 
' Third residence halls, 
necessitated by "rap idly 
escalating labor and material 
costs," was approved routinely. 

Reagan's visit to the meeting 
was preceeded Thursday by 
demonstrations involvin g 300 
students against university policy 
in areas of corporate. investments, 
financial aid, minority tudies, 
and the university's opposition to 
the incorporation of the student 
ommunity of Isla Vista, nearby

Cost Increases Cloud Fq,ture of Campus Housing 
by Charles Heimler 

Although UCSD administrators hedge in admitting it, the in-
f lationary spira l and its effect on rates charged for dormitories hav 
cau d some erious consideration of the future of on-campus housing. 

Since its inception, UCSD has been committed to housing 35-40 p r 
(ent of its students on-campus. But this year, because of in reased 
enroilml.'nt and lack of on-campus housing to meet that increase, only 
30 per cent of UCSD undergrads live on ampus. 

Increased rates for on-campus housing is pricing some students out 
of the market, while rising building costs (both materials, loans and 
labor) ar in uring further rate hikes for any new dorms to be built in 
the future . 

And food costs, which have risen ten per cent in the last year are 
expe ted to rise at that rate during this coming year . 

Looking towards next school year appears even gloomier. With the 
completion of Step I of Third College and In reasing food (osts, dorm 
rates will rise S200. 

What it all points to is the progression of UCSD towards being a 
commuter college-just the opposite of what the university's planners 
had in mind and present administrators elaborate on as the virtue of 
the 5an Diego campus. 

"After Third College is built," believes Larry Barrett, director of 
housing and food services, "we're going to have to take a hard look at 
future dorm construction because of what it will do to the rate 
tructure" 

" I don't have a good solution for it," echoes H .D . Johnson, assistant 
(hancellor for business and finance, "but if prices keep going up we're 
going to be inclined not to buil,i." 

Despite the economic toreca~t. proponent~ and defenders of th 
UCSD separate collt'ge ystem believl" UCSD will be able to return- In 

four or five years, though- to the ideal of the on-campu a ademic and 
so ial ommunfty

Bugging Big Brother: Addendum 
",h1.n Doug Porter of the Fifth Estate group 

spoke "J"UCSD October 22. he \ made one crucial 
omissipl'l . The expressed purpose of the Fifth Estate 
tour was to promote the organization of Fifth Estate 
style investigation groups on campuses and in 
communities. UCSD was Doug's first stoP. so things 
weren't quite as together as they no doubt will be 
further down the road . What he neglected to tell his 
audience is that there currently exists a political 
investigation group registered at UCSD as a 
student/staff organization and that they encourage 
involvement from the UCSD community. 

investigation into the affair. The purpose was to 
document extensive official complicity' (by 
California Department of Corrections. l.A.P.D .â¢ 
Evelle Younger. possibly CIA. and others) in the 
creation and support of the SlA. The audience got a 
revelatory glimvse at how far certain government 
and economic forces may be g~ng to extend their 
strength and control . They also heard a first-hand 
account by Rhodes of officially sponsored terrorism 
in the prisons. of guard-controlled narcoti~s 
rackets. of recruitment of prisoners for political 
infiltration and provocation activities, of 
assassination lists (one of which Rusty had spirited 
out of San Quentin and brought with him) for non-
cooperator} and others who know too much. 

government and the economic sphere. Good 
contacts already exist with Freed's Citizen's 
Research and Investigative Committee in L.A . and 
the Fifth Estate in Washington. D .C. Through these 
groups. it is possible to connect to virtually every 
important such group in the country. 

COAIC projects can include local investigations. 
the San Diego end of national issues. as well as 
more general research into 1he advancing 
technologies of social control . Action strategies can 
be developed. which in many cases can be as 
simple as exposing a covert operation . 

The group is the Committee to Organize an 
Alternative Intelligence Community (COAIC). 
COAIC organized last summer. Contacts were 
established almost immediately with author Donald 
Freed (Executive Action, Agony in New H .... en. 0-
editor of The Glasshouse Tapes). On Aug. 20, 
COAIC presented The Truth About Tania/Patty and 
the SLA, a lecture program held in Balboa Park in 
which Freed and associates Rusty Rhodes and Lake 
Headley detailed the results of their independent 

COAIC hopes to develop Its own Investigations as 
well as sponsor more public information programs 
su h as the SLA and Fifth Estate lecture. The 
possibilities are limited only by thE' energies of the 
people involved. COAIC has the basis to gain 
ac ess to E'xtraord inary nation-wide sources on the 
intelligence community and its connections in 

If you want to become involved in such an effort 
or at least find out more about it. COAIC will be 
having an organizational meeting on November 20.

"FinE', but where 00 I go from here?". this is where 
you should go. 

THE CRAWLING EYE 

Letters 
Inaccuracies 

, 

To the Editor of the Triton Times : 
I can honestly say that I had expected 

a higher quality of journalism from the 
Triton Times . The problem the Com-
mittee for Disabled Students had in 
getting you to publish announcements of 
our meetings was attributed by TT 
members to the problems your staff was 
having in making the switch from two 
issues to three issues a week. I'm sure 
that everyone. including Ms. Garcia in 
the Revelle Provost Office. who 
delivered the announcements personally. 
only to have them not appear. also 
understands. 

However. the article which appeared 
in last Monday's issue was so full of 
inaccuracies that I cannot imagine any 
way you came up with these " facts" 
other than sitting in the office and 
making them up. At the very least,. you 
did not actually verify them. 

Ignoring the disappointing length of 
the promised article. I willingly admit 
that the first sentence was accurate and 
that the second, though not complete in 
detail. was also accurate. So much for 
the first two paragraphs. It was 'the th'ird 
paragraph that distorted the . facts so 
completely I almost thought there was 
someone else with my name walking 
around campus with tremendous in-
fluence and power. not to mention a 
salary. 

Your statement that I was hired by 
Ar~hitects and Engineering to survey the 
campus is misleading in the extreme. I 
was not hired by A&E. nor was I ap-
proached by them for this or any other 
purpose. Though I do see and report 
problems with existing buildings on my 
own. now. I have no official duty to 
" locate outdated faciliti s and report 
them for updatmg." 

What is true is that Mr. AI Rea, of 
Environmental Health and Safety. was 
able to put my brother and me on his 
payroll at the end of August. This was to 
help on a survey of the campus already in 
progress and nearly finished. to deter-
mine the physical barriers to the 
oisabled . Karl Burns and another student. 
who left EH&S before completion of the 
survey. were involved on -this project 
from the start, organized it, and did most 
of the work outside of routings for 
wheElchairs . We did point out areas for 
corrf ctions and for the most part, 
feasi )ility did not play a role outside 
Matt l)E!ws Campus. 

The .architects were involved only in 
prov ding us with maps. This was not 
their survey. and they w re to be the 
onE'S to mdKI;! U I preC'rrt"tion for ap-
provll and fund allocation . 

A' for reporting outoat d buildings 
now 'l1uch of that work i now In the 
han( s pf the members of our committee. 
whe e it belongs . I can point out where I 
thin !: cOrlectlons arE' ne d d, but th risk 
of IT issing something b ause of lack of 
I'Xp rlen ce with the problems is too 
great Since most of thE' (ommltt e 

members use the facilities. they should 
b the on es to recommend design 
chqnges. They know how adequate the 
facilities really are . 

The ommittee IS pre ent ly made up of 
disabled students and Central Library 
employees. non-disabled students and 
employe s. Mr. Mort. the other deans. 
and Mr. Rea and Dr. Allen as consultants. 
We have a viable. working and com-
mitted group. and our interests are noc 
limited to those mentioned in the article; 
we are looking at much more. including 
the establishment of our own office and 
coordinator . 

Kathy Newman. a committee member 
with experience with the deaf. offered to 
write an accurate article for the TT. 
Because of your rules. she was prohibited 
from doing this. Instead. to make it easier 
for you to write it for us. we gave you the 
names and phone numbers of students 
who could give you the views of three 
different disabilities . I don't think you 
contacted more than one of these. and 
the result has been an inaccurate and 
disappointing article. 

Your article gave the impression that 
all was being done since someone had 
been appointed to study the problem . 
This is exactly the type of situation and 
misconception that I had hoped my 
previous letter to you would have 
avoided. We don't need more study : we 
need funding and action . Articl es such as 
yours are almost certain to keep the 
disabled forgotten . We had expected 
much more from you .

Express Outrage 
On Wed . Nov. 13. the Los Angeles 

Times quoted Gen . George S. Brown. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. as 
saying that the Jewish people "own, you 
know. the banks in this country. the 
newspapers." He also threateningly 
remarked that Americans might "get 
tough minded enough to set down the 
Jewish influence in this country and 
break that lobbv." 

Stop a minute. and think how serious 
these remarks really are . This is a blatant 

power. The con equ nces of his remark 
could be devastating. Such prejudiced 
feelings as those expressed by Brown 
threaten not only Jews. but ultimately 
threaten all our Citizens. Who will 
Brown's next target be.? 

Only by the removal of Brown, and by 
the public expression of disapproval of 
such remarks can the danger be 
alleviated. We must let our elected 
representatives know of our outrage. 
Accordingly, we urge you to write. to 
Pres . Ford . Secretary of .defense 
Schlesinger. and your local represen-
tatives.

Brown Another Hitler 
On Wednesday morning. Nov. 13. an 

article appearing in the Los Angeies 
Times regardine comments made by the 
Chairman of the Joint Ch iefs of Staff. 
Gen. George S. Brown .. 

A man in Brown's position. i.e .â¢ is in 
charge of the entire United States 
military force. has much power and 
influence in the U .S. One remembers. in 
the late 1930Â·s. one Adolf Hitler. who 
also had much power and influence in 
his nation. had the same thought in mind 
as Brown has: "set down the Jewish 
influence." . 

Hitler succeed!'d in killing sill million 
Il;!ws and almost exterminating the entire 
'European lewish. population . Brown has 
lIiso Six ilfillion Jew~ to "get tough-
mlnderi on in the United States." But. 
remember. the Jews have long endured 
oppression'. much stronger waves of anti-
Semitism, and beat th ei r attackers in war 
when the odds' (100.000 to 1 in some 
cases) were heavily against them. 

If Brown thinks that we American Jews 
will lie down and let him kill us off like 
Hitler oid; keep this in mind: today's 
American Jews are stronger. smarter and 
more together as one than ever b!!fore.

Do It With Drugs 
We are extremely upset that Dr. 

Louis West spoke on "Human Violence" 
for a UCSD Extension Course Nov. 15. 
This man is the director of a center at 

. UCLA that calls for the use of 
psychosurgery and sterilizing drugs on 
prisoners. hyperactive children. and 
other so-called "disturbed" individuals. 
Psychosurgery requires the irreversable 
destruction of brain cells to (ontrol 
behavior. Rather than curing any disease. 
psychosuri\ery results in massive loss of 
personality and the ability to function as 
a contributing member of society (in 
other words-"eliminate the individual 
and you do not have to deal with the 
problem"). Psychosurgery is particularly 
racist in that it is used against a large 
number of minority prisoners and is 
considered by most psychosurgeons to 
be a "cure" for ghetto rebellions and 
other fights for better conditions. It 
wrprises mE' that this uniV(>rsity would 
inVite an advo ate of ~u(h genocidal 
programs to speak. especially when the 
oPPosing viewpoint is not r\'presented

The Great Kitten Giveaway 
The managing editor, city editor, and creativity editor of the 

Triton Times have been adopted by two black kitterJs, cine of which 
hops. and both of which like hot dogs and cheetos. 

Unfortunately, the creativity editor is profoundly allergic to cats, 
and says he will feed them draino and put them in the garbage 
disposal if we don't find homes for them. 

You may free the little balls of fun from this horrible fate [and, 
secondarily, from cheetos and hot dogs] by coming to the Triton 
Times office today or tomorrow and grabbing one. We will supply a 
week's worth of cat food with each animal. [We'd r~ther not break 
up the set, but we will if we haveto.]

It is the most dramatic book ever written on first century 
Christians. There hes never been a book like it. Historically ac-
curate. bringing in almost aU available information on the first 
century church. it nonetheless reads Â· like a noval. Powerful. 
unrelenting and controversial. it challenges the present day 
practice of the church. 

It is the kind of book Christians will be telling one another to read.

Theatre ,of Dreams and Fantasy 
" leonce and le'na" and "The Condemned Man's Bicycle" 

will be presented free of charge this weekend by UCSO's 
Drama department. The plays are directed by Peter Klein and 
Frank Condon, respectively, who are UCSD b'1'aduate students . 

The themes for the performance are fantasy, fairy tale, and 
dream, which should make for an interesting f'venin~ . The 
audience will be limited to 50 people to foster the intimacy 
that both directors want to achieve. In addition, the audience 
will " restructure" itself to fit into a maze duririg the in-
termission, the center of which is the "stage" for the second 
play. 

============~--====~~~==========~ 

Tonight in the UCSD gym, one of the most unique and 
highly-praised theatrical attractions of recent years: The 
National Theatre of The Deaf. Photo above from a 
previous show in their repetory. tonight's program 
features 8 double hill. "The Dybbuk" and "Priscilla. 
Princess of Power." Show starts tonight at 8:00 and 
tickets are still available. 

The first play is " leonce and lena" by Georg Buchner 
(1813-1839) . It is a product of the German Romantic 
movement and is a "fairy tale comedy" according to director 
Peter Klein. "Buchner died of typhus at the age of 23", says 
Peter, "and the play is the product of the fleJ(ing of his in-
tellectual muscles." 

Ruchner's era was a turbulent one which saw the 
Napoleonic Wars and the Revolution of 1830 among other 
things . The compleJ( social changes gave impetus and 
nirf'ction to several writers, and there was a great interest in 
fairy tales and German myths. The work of the brothers 
Grimm was being circulated at the time and undoubtedly had 
om(' Influf'nce on Buchner. -

But ''If'on e and Lena" is not a simple fairy tale Things 
happen in the play that hint at tragedy . The duality IS (on-
tlnut'd In "ThE' Condemned Man 's Bicycle" by r ernando 
Arrabal , which is a bit more contemporary (1958) . Director 
I rank Condon characteril' es it as "a tragedy performed by 
Pun h and Judy," and b based on a dream the author had. 

Arrabal \ liff' has bf'E:'n f'xtremf'ly stormy. A Spaniard by 
birth, Iw han to suffer through the Spanish Civil War with his 
fathE'r a RE:'publican and hi s mother a Royal ist Thoroughly

authority figures," hays. Old frienos like Charli e Chaplin , 
Harpo Marx, and Laurel and Hardy lend their vi ual anti cs to 
the play, but they are cast in quite different roles than 
audiences are used to. 

Tickets for the show-which runs from Friday to Monday, 
Nov . 22-25- are available at the Drama department office on 
Matthew's Campus and are free. The program starts at 8 pm. 
rach night in 409 MC (behind the Matthews cafeteria) and the 
directors emphasize that there will be no late seating .

Brain Damage and MorihlJono 
by T. Mauah 

The possibility that marihuana 
use may be hazardous has 
produced a remarkable 
polarization among scientists. 
Those who sav that marihuana 
poses no special hazards espouse 
their convictions with an 
evangelistic zeal that borders on 
fanaticism. Those who think there 
are hazards argue their case with 
only slightly less fervor, and all 
too often scientifi c debate has 
fall n by the wayside. This 
polariLation is reinforced by the 
mass of ontradictory ev idf'nce 
that cems to lend support to 
both sides. Thf' naive indiviclual 
seeking guidance is often hard-
pressed to know whom to believe

se lves hazardous . What is of 
greater (oncern IS the possibility 
that Lontlnuat ion of these E'ffects 
over a period of tim(' Â·may 
produce or~anic brain damage. 

Tf'trahydrocannabinol , th e 
prln ipal psychoa tive con-
stituent of cannabiS, has a very 
high affinity for brain ancl oth r 
lipophilic tissu s. th at is, tissues 
with a hi gh proportion o f 
hydrocarbon-like (omponents. 
Accordi ng to W 0 M Paton of 
th E:' University of Oxford , 
tetrahydrocannabinol has an 
octanol : wat er partition coef-
ficien t of about 6000: 1. Th is 
coefficient is of th same order of 
magnitude as those of the long-
li ved pollutants DDT and 
polych lorinated biphenyls. and 
in di ca t es that tetrahydrocan -
nabinol will be absorbed by 
lipophili tissues and stored by 
them for long periods. 

Julius Axelrod of the National 
Institute of Mental Health , 
B thesda, Maryland, has shown 
that only barely detectable 
co ncentrations of tetrahydro -
cannabinol are present in the 
brain of a rat after one dose; most 

of 'the tetrahydrocannabinol 
appears in fatty tissues. With 
repeated administration, though, 
there is a gradual buildup of the 
drug and its metabolites in the 
brain . How long it persists there is 
still unknown, but Axelrod has 
found tetrahydrocannabinol and 
its metabolites in the urine of the 
rat as long as 8 days after ad-
ministration of a single dose . 

The eff cts of this persistence 
ar a subject of debate, but many 
scipntists argue th at the con-
tinu ed prese nce of 
tetrahydrorannabinolln the brain 
inducf's a ~e t of mental 
charact eri stics termed th e 
"amotlvatlonal syndrome." This 
syndrome IS fami li ar to most 
t linl cia ns who have treated 
(annabis us{>l's, and has perhaps 
b st bf'en described by 
psychl atmts Harold Kolansky and 
William T. Moore of the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
Philadelph ia 

Kolan ky and Moore treated 13 
Individuals bf'tween the ages of 
20 and 41 Yf'ar who had smoked 
cannabiS three to ten times a 
week for at least 16 months. All 
howed the same set of symp-

toms: The patients were 
hara teristically apathetic and 

sluggish in mental and phYSical 
responses. There was usually a 
goallessness and a loss of interest 
in personal appearance. Con-
siderable flattening of affect gave 
a false impress ion of ca lm and 
wf'll -being ; this was usually 
accompanied by the patients' 
('onviction that they had recently 
developed ('motional maturity 
and insight aid d by cannabiS. 
This pseudof'quanimlty was asi ly 
disrupted If the patients were 
question ed abou t th eir per -
sonality change, new philosophy, 
and drug onsumption , or if their 
supplies of cannabis were 
threatened. Thf' indivinuals wert' 
physi ca lly thin , often appeared 
tired , and f'x hib ited slow d 
physi cal movement~. They also 
showed symptoms of mental 
(onfusion, a slowed time sense, 
diffi culty with recent memory, 
and an incapability of complet ing 
thoughts ouring verbal com-
munication . 

* * * Reese Jon es of th University of 
California 's Langly -Port e r 
Nf'uropsychiatnc Institute in San 
Francisco has observed cannabis 
users under similar conditions,

equivalent of two packs of 
marihuana cigarettes. At these 
doses, he says, tetrahydrocan-
nabinol produ ces a 'strong 
depreSSion of the central nervous 
system similar to that effected by 
sedatives and tranquilizers. 

Jones also finns, however, that 
tol erance to these doses develops 
within a week and that 
motivation and fun ctioning are at 
least partially res tored . ThiS 
toleran ce, and some of the 
physiological effects that a -

conclude that cannabl pronuces 
phYSical dependence. 

* * * 
leo Hollister of the Veterans 

Administration Research Hospital 
in Palo Alto, Californi a, has 
examined many of the efff'cts of 
si ngle doses of cannabis . He finds 
that cannabis, like alcohol and 
somE' other drugs, se('rT)s to 
disrupt the transfer of In -
formation in th e brain from short-
term to long-term memory. In-
formation acquired whil e under 
the influence of cannabis would 
thus be forgotten more easily 
than if it were acquired while 
sober; subjects would also have 
difficulty completing their 
thoughts during conversations.. . 

Most of the other evidence 
bearing on the possibility of brain 
damage has been obtained under 
much less rigidly co ntrolled 
conditions. One of the most 
controversial pieces of evidence 
has been provided by the late 
A .M .G . Campbel l and his 
as oClates at the British Royal 
United Hospitals, london . They 
obtained air encephalograms-
a type of x-ray in which air is in-
I cted into the brain cavity-<>f 
the brains of ten young males 
who had used cannabis very 
heavily for 3 to 11 years . Close 
comparison w i th air en-
(ep halogram s of carefully 
matched controls suggested that 
the brains of the users had 
physi cally atrophied. Campbell 
attributed this atrophy to the use' 
of cannabis, but other in-
vestigators have argued that the 
subjec ts also used vasocon -
stri ctive drugs, such as am-
phetamines and LSD, that could 
be responsible for the observed 
("ffects . 

In summary, then , it seems 
likely that th~ putative lin~ 
between heavy long-term use ot 
cannabis and possible brain 
damdge will remain controversial 
for some time to come.

"I'm not under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs." 

"Then how," Harry says, "do 
you explain your driving?" 

I . sigh . "Look, I'm an artist 
man . I le~ve the explanations t~ 
others. I just do it ." 

'Why were you weaving?" Joe 
wants to know. 

"Why were you driving so close 
to the center divider all through 

D~ I Mar?" Harry asks . 
l'Look, officers. Let's be homo 

sapiens about this. Either I was 
weaving or I was too .close to the 
center line. Now which is it? You 
can't have it both ways." 

"Look at my forehead," Joe 
says. He shines his light in my 
eyes to see if my pupils are 
di lated . 

"Did you graduate from high 
school?" 10(' asks . 

"As a matter of fact, I didn't 
think I was goi ng to and had 
applied for the police force . But 

t~en, 10 and behold, I got my 
diploma . Some of us have all the 
luck, eh officer?" 

"Can you say t~e alphabet?" 
"Yes, I' can. Can you do 

calculusr' Poor, I know, but the 
best I can do at the time. 

"Uh, no I can't, but-" 
"Can you tell me the difference 

between a pi bond and a sigma 
bond?" 

"Listen, buddy, I'm-" 
"Have you read Voltaire, Plato, 

Rousseau, or Rabe lais?" 

"No," he says grimly. 
"Then:" I declare, "we have 

nothin g to say to each other. I'm 
sorry, gentlemen, but I must bring 
this tableau to a close . My 'card, 
sirs. Come by anytime. I'm sure 
we can find something for you in 
t he organization ." 

Joe and Harry are stunned. 
They don't know what to do . 

"Before I leave, however, might 
have my personal docum nts 

return d me? Sometimes I wake 
up in the morning and don't know 

Housing Future Clouded 
Continued from Page 3 

stude n.ts will be ad.mitted to ~uir next year, says John ~tewart, provost 
of M~Ir. Fewer will be let In over the next years with the hope of 
redUCing the total number to the ideal after five years. 

The jump of ~:)Ver 300 students at Muir this year is explained by 
Stewart as resulting from more students continuing at the college than 
were expected. 

Stewart believes that commuter students have a "diminished ex-
perience" in terms of UCSD academic and soci al interaction . "They 
n1l5s ou! on the evening things, but hop fully the opening of the 
MandeVille Center and Student Center will encourage people to stick 
around." 

A partial solution to the housing problem may orne in the addition 
of 200 apartments to the Mesa Apartment complex east of th e main 
campus. 

The plan is to build the apartments and use 50 for married students 
and 150 for undergrads (housing up to 4 stude nts) . 

Dan Sites, assistant chan cellor for facilities management and Chuck 
Powers, campus architect, are directing the construction of the 
complex through a novel approach to building campus housi ng. 

It is ca lled the "turnkey" approach and consists of contracting with a 
private developer to build the complex . Bids are sent out and the 
contract is awarded to the company with best hou si ng plans. 

"We tell what th e complex should contain ," exp lai ns Sites, "but not 
what it should look like." 

This method differs from the traditional way of building campus 
hOUSing . In that mann er, the design process is done by university 
personn el with emphasis on "arts and architecture." 

Complet ion of such projects, from the design to occupancy, take up 
to four years. . 

who I am. I'm sure you both know 
the problem . Such being the case 
I must have them." ' 

Joe looks at me blankly, then 
hurriedly hands over the license 
and ' registration . 

"Thank you, sir.. And now a 
question of my own . Who do I 
have to thank for this pleasant 
interrude?" 

"Huh," they say, as on . 
"Your names, gentlemen ." 
" Joe De llums and Harry 

Waltoll Â·" 
" I knew my trust in you was 

we!! placed. In about three days, 
you should be receiving a letter 
from my lawyer . Am I making this 
clear?" 

"LJp, yeah. " 
"Cuod. Have someooe read to 

you Â·wllen it comes." I start the 
<.a r <lJld . li ght a cigarette. 

"qood-riight, men."

Jewish School 
Continued from P~ge 1 

Konitz feels that many of the 
students receive no training in 
these trad itio ns and cu ltures in 
the hom e . " Originally, the 
grandpare nt s taught these 
traditions . Now they are not 

ven celebrated in the home at 
all. " There are no synagogues in 
the area to serve the com-

mu nit y, so in a sense, the school 
and the organ ization provide 
the . only cultural ' education 
available to Jews in the area . 
Konltz fee ls Judaism is "as much 
a culture as a religion . It is 
almost like a family . Go to any 
country and th ere will be a 
Jewish commu nity there ., 
Although the people will be 
diffe~ent and the ir language will 
be different, they will be doing 
the same basic things that are 
done here." 

You don't blow an extraordinary idea 
, on an ordinarY shoe. 

By now you're probably 
aware that Roots are not 
like other kinds of footwear. 
The heel is lower to give 
you the natural kind of 
walk you 'd get by going 
barefoot in sand. The arch 
is supported, so if you 
spend much time on your 
feet you'll now spend it in 
much greater comfort. The 
rocker sole helps spring 
you off on each footstep, 
so walking become~ a little 

less wo.rk than it ever was 
before. 
But a big part of Roots ' 
success lies in not how

they re made, but how 
well . Only the finest grade 
Canadian hides are 
selec ted. Thes4:! are hand-
crafted into Roots, simply 
because. for much of our 
production, the most 
efficient machine is still the 
human hand. 
This is why, of all the 
reasons we could give you 
for trying Roots , none 
would fit quite so well as the
