Board of Regents approves 
I4,percent fee increase 

-,IDANTIAO 
Associate News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved the fee increases pro-
posed by the recent compact 
reached between UC President 
Roben C. Dynes and Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger at the board's 
meeting on May 20. Resident 
undergraduate fees will increase 
by 14 percent jn the 2004-05 aca-
demic year and by 8 percent in the 
2005-06 and 2006-07 academic 
years. The Board of Regents 
approved the increases 14-2 after 
the Finance Committee dead-
locked 5-5 on the issue on May 
19. 

"The fee increases approved 
today are significant, and 1 know 
they will have an impact on many 
families," Dynes said in, a May 20 
statement. "We are striving, to the 
best of our abiljty given the state's 
fiscal crisis, to preserve quality, 
accessibility and the university's 
contributions to the economy, 
health and quality of life of 
California." 

Student Regent Matt Murray, in 
his final meeting as a full voting 
member of the board, voted against 
the fee increase proposal to "make 
a point about the budget," saying 
that he djsagreed with 
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget 
for California. 

"This is pan of a larger propos-

al by the governor that would place 
the burden of the state's budget 
problems on the people who can 
least afford it and protect those 
who can most afford it," Murray 
said. "The people who can most 
afford it aren't sharing in solving 
the state's problem, and I think 
that's inequitable and that it's terri-
ble public policy, and I think that 
there needs to be people saying 
that." 

Murray and Regent George 
Marcus, who also voted against dle 
increases, said they felt that the 
agreement could undermine the 
efforts of legislators attempting to 
provide the unjversjty with addi-
tional funding during the upcom-
ing budget revision. 

The potential reduction in the 
percentage of new fees returned to 
financial aid also concerned 
Murray. The compact proposes 
that the Regents determine what 
percentage of fee increases is 
returned to financial aid. The per-
centage would have to be between 
20 percent and 33 percent, while in 
the past no less than 33 percent of 
fee increases have gone to financial 
aid. 

"I. think that it's sad," Murray 
said. "It's another step toward lim-
iting access to the univenjty, and 1 
don't think that there's anyone in 
the univenity who thinks that that's

I BRIEFLY 
SRTV unplugged for alleged 

pornograPhic content 
A technician at Thornton Hospital shut 

down the broadcast of Student Run Television 
on May 16 after receiving complaints from hos-
pital patients and Preuss School officials who 
viewed "pornographic' materials on the station, 
according to station programmer Chelsea 
Welch. This took the station off the air for 
almost four days. 

The station believes an unauthorized intrud-
er, possibly a former SRTV member, entered the 
studio to broadcast material banned during day-
time hours by the station's charter, Welch said, 
though there were no signs of forced entry. 

Campus police have been alerted of the 
security breach. 

Though the reruns aired during the day on 
the statJon included bare breasts, Welch said 
the station does not know if this was the mate-
nal responsible for the inciden~ explaining that 
"there IS no genitalia shown on SRN.' 

Thornton officials gained access to the 
broadcast eqUIpment because Triton Cable uses 
the hospital's facilities, Welch said, though they 
are not authorized to exercise editorial control. 

While the station returned on air in the after-
noon of May 19, its signal continues to be cen-
sored from Preuss School and hospitals in the 
UCSD HealthCore system, according to welch. 

Edward Veldin, director of telecommunica-
tions for UCSD Healthcare, dedined to comment 

UC Student Regent 
nominated for 2005-06 

The UC Board of Regents selection commit-
tee nominated Adam R Rosenthal, a UCLA grad-

ing. Rosenthal would become the 31st student

year, participating in board deliberations, before 
becoming a full voting member in July 2005.

MONDAY, MAY 24, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Hospital: Workers rally at nine campuses 
continued from page I 

Municipal Employees Local 
3299, arc in negotiations for new 
contracts with university offi-
cials. 

"We've been trying to work 
out these issues with the universi-
ty for a year now and they haven't 
been going anywhere," Kimberley 
Carter, assistant director of 
AFSCME 3299, said. "So we're 
out here, not just here but every 
campus in the state, to rally and to 
show the university that we're 
serious." 

Among some of the key issues 
raised by the demonstrators dur-
ing the rally included increasing 
retention, better pay, fair rules 
concerning layoffs during a time 
of budget cuts and giving workers 
the opportunity to advance 
through training and education_ 
According to organizers, approxi-
mately 2,000 UC workers demon-
strated throughout the state, with 
about 100 picketing at the UCSD 
Medical Center at Hillcrest. 
Union representatives presented 
their demands to the office of 
UCSD Medical Center Chief 
Executive Officer Richard 
Liekweg. 

"We strive to fairly compen-
sate and reward all of our 
employees, and we offer an 
impressive array of benefits and 
opporrunities for our workforce," 
UCSD Director of Health 
Sciences Communications Leslie 
Franz said. "However, in a poor 
economy, it is difficult to offer 
the level of salary increases possi-
ble when the budget is stronger." 

AFSCME 3'299 represents 
patient care and service workers, 
including custodians, food ser-
vice workers, radiology techni-
cians and medical assistants. 
According to Carter, the workers 

would like the opporrunity to 
receive training in order to 
adwnce their careers and to have 
a better pay system based on 
seniority_ 

"Some of the jani tors, if they 
have the desire to be a registered 
nurse, should be able to receive 
training so they can make an 
investment in their furure," 
Carter said. "Currendy, pay is 
based on an archaic merit system, 
where if you get along with the 
supervisor, they can improve your 
pay, but if you don't get along 
with them, you might not get a 
raise at all ... We want pay based 
on seniority. " 

According to a statement 
released by the UC Office of the 
President, the recent budget cuts 
have resulted in unavoidable cut-
backs. 

Recognizing the current 
financial situation of the univer-
sity, AFSCME 3299 workers 
have demanded the reform of 
policies in order to stop bonuses 
and raises for top UC executives 
during a time of enrollment caps, 
student fee increases and service 
cutbacks, union representatives 
said. 

At UCSD, recently appointed 
UCSD chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox will receive 570,000 more 
than her predecessor, Robert C. 
Dynes. 

According to UCOP, chancel-
lors and other campus administra-
tors, as a group, have received the 
same general salary increases as 
systemwide staff with a 2 -percent 
increase in 2001-02 and I.S-per-
cent increase 2002-03 and zero 
percent in 2003-04. 

"Salaries for UC chancellors 
continue to seriously lag the mar-
ket and we are having to increase 
salaries for new chancellors 

because unless we do so, there's no 
way we can attract the caliber of 
person we need to maintain insti -
rutional quality and competitive-
ness," UCOP spokesman Palll 
Schwartz said. 

Many of the workers demon-
strating at UCSD Medical 
Center stressed that the wages 
they receive do not meet cost of 
living increases and that they 
have not received a raise in over 
two ycars_ 

"We all still do a cri tical job for 
the hospital ," said Rafael 
Martinez, a custodian for the 
medical ccnter's environmental 
services department. "We should 
all at least be given a decent pay 
that we can survive on. San Diego 
County is very expensive ". gas 
prices are going up, rent's going 
up, even the price of milk is going 
up." 

Workers also claimed that dif-
ferent departments have been 
short-staffed due to recent bud-
get cuts and that they are receiv-
ing the same wages for increa ed 
amounts of work. According to 
Denise Myers, who works at the 
medical center's registration 
finance department and is an 
AFSCME member, the universi-
ty is not providing adequate pay 
for the work done by its employ-
ees. 

"1 see a lot of injustice here," 
Myers said. "There are a lot of 

p~:ticular people that have been 
working a long time and have not 
been given the same benefitS, with 
some working ovenime, more 
than their job description, and I 
don't think it's fair." 

According to Carter, the 
union will continue to pressure 
the university to comply with its 
demands throughout the ongoing 
contract negotiation process.

Regents approve new 
Cardiovascular Center 

ByUSAMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved beginning the construc-
tion of a new Cardiovascular Center 
and expansion of Thornron Hospital 
at its May 20 meeting. They fol-
lowed the recommendations of the 
Regents' Finance, and Grounds and 
Buildings committees, which gave 
their approval May 19. 

The project is being made pos-
sible through efforts of the UCSD 
Cardiovascular Center Board, 
whi ch has raised $30 million 
through fundraising events and 
community gifts. 

The Cardiovascular Center, 
which began in 1996 and is cur-
rendya "center without walls,» will 

Le built adjacent to Thornton 
Hospital. Formal plans for the 
development of the center will 
include an outpatient facility, 16 to 
20 examination rooms, and related 
diagnostic and treatment services 
from UCSD medical specialists. 

"Cardiovascular disease and 
stroke are the first and third lead-
ing causes of death and disability in 
the nation 's adult population," Vice 
Chancellor of Health Sciences 
Edward M . Holmes said. "And lhe 
numbers are growing, so we feel a 
tremendous responsibili ty to pro-
vide leadership in research and 
patient care for these significant 
public health issues. The [Center] 
will enable us to centralize and

STUDENT PROTESTS:

Opinion Editor 

"The whole world is wa[ching! T he whole

Maybe not the whole world, bur for a 
moment, California was watching. 

The May 18 protest at the inter section of 
La Jolla Vi llage Drive and Villa La Jolla 
Drive stopped traffic for about hal f an hour. 
Demonstra ti ng against the continual budget 
cuts to Californias public schools and con-
stantly rising' fees for higher education, at 
least 150 students from around San Diego 
marched from Price C enter to the street in a 
loud, boisterous show o f unity. This protest, 
of course, did not in itself lower student fees. 
Like campus protests of the war in Iraq and 
the College Republican flip-flop protest at 
the J ohn Kerry rally in Price Center, the bud-
get cut march did not force politicians to alter 
thei r agenda . 

But it let them know that they 
should, in a way that no public 
opinion poll could convey.

still watching? 

and a live repott from KOGO radio's Wade 
Douglas, who wielded a cell phone to relay 
the events. 

This was the right way to do a protest: .. 
Warn the police ahead of time, so they know 
what to expect. When cops get jumpy, acci-
dental shots can be fired. In the heat of the 
moment, a wallet can look like a gun or a cell 
phone can be mistaken for a pipe bomb. 
Effective protests ask for permits ahead of 
time, when possible , to ensure the safety of 
participants. Since this protest was contin-
gent upon performing an illegal act - unlaw-
fully obstructing traffic and refusing to dis-
perse - bringing the police in on it was the 
safest course of action. 

The students got the public's attention, 
just like the protestors for the disabled popu-
lation did in Sacramento. Blocking traffic is 
an effective (if annoying) method of getting 
uninterested people to pay attention to you.

around the intersection would

Ah, the modem protest. People come 
together, fight for a cause, block traffic, per-
haps throw rocks at some billboards, maybe 
erect a statue of a Western leader so that they 
can tear it down again, and even get on the 
local news - maybe CNN, if they are really 
lucky. Protesting these days is littered with 
benefits, including a ready-made social group 
and something to feel good about. 

These days, most protests fit such descrip-
tions. Indeed, many rocks were thrown in San 
Francisco last year during war protests. The 
protests that met President George W. Bush 
in England included a larger-than-life stlltue 
that was happily demolished. Seem a little bit 
violent? Perhaps, but it also sounds like a lot 
of fun. And to a large extent, protests have 
become recreation. 

Last week, five UCSD students were 
arrested for blocking traffic in 
La Jolla . Not exactly recreation-

Note the rhetoric of the A.S. Commissioner 
of Diversity Affairs and protest participant 
Chris Sweeten: " ... We're a united front , and 
we won't stop until the rights of students have 
been met" ("Five UCSD students arrested 
after rally," May 20). 

Although access to education is a serious 
issue, protesting these days is just a part of the 
politics of interests. "We wanted to send a 
message that we're not happy," said Harish 
Nandagopal, one of the students arrested . 
These days, when people are not happy and 
fail to get their way, they protest. Protests 
mosdy stem from circumstances being unfa-
vorable to them, although almost all protes-
tors claim a great moral wrong exists. This 
wealcens the moral authority of protests in an 
age when anyone who feels confident enough 
to claim moral high ground can organize and 
find many ready participants who happily go 
along for the ride.

unexpected, however, as the 
arrested students readily admit-
ted that they were prepared to 
be arrested. Enjoyable or not, 
the real question is whether this 
protest, like so many before it,

population> disabled people and 
their ca retakers protested in front of the state 
Capito l. Camera bulbs flashed and film 
roll ed, and people throughout the state heard 
their cries. The media spotlight brought 
attention to their cause, and the governor 
reversed his decision to cur disabled benefits. 

Some protests accompli sh no thing in 
terms of policy change, but they can still 
make a difference. Millions of people across 
the world protested impending war in Iraq, 
but the U nited States still invaded . Yet the 
Bush administration and its alli es abroad 
knew from the protests that they needed to 
explain more fully their reasons for going to 
war. Subsequently, the beleaguered world 
leaders took to the airwaves to defend their 
plan . T he intended policy shift - no inva-
sion - didn 't happen, but the protesters still 
accompl ished somethi ng. A seemingly failed 
protest ca n sti ll effect change. 

T he UCSD protest of I ising fees and bud-
get curs was especially sllcce~ful because of 
the way it was executed. The organizers 
pl anned everything in advance. It was nonvi -
olent. T hey noti fi ed the media and the police 
ahead of time, as evidenced by the horse-
mounted officers, officers on motorcycles, 
and more in cruisers and on foot. P rint, racio 
and television journalists covered the story, 
with at least three separate televi sion cameras 

Normally, many of the 
motorists would have no reason 
to worry about student fees. 

Given a choice between a higher "car tax" or 
higher student fees, the average rational, 
self-interested Californian would choose to 
save his or her money on vehicle registration. 
Californians have finite attention spans and 
most are not thinking of rising student fees 
right now. They are more concerned with 
rising gas prices, rising property values and a 
volatile stock market. But when their busy 
li ves are interrupted by a bunch of kids 
blocking the roadway, they have a reason to 
listen. Even if they do not agree with the 
protesters' tactics, they will still gain at least 
a superficial understanding of their collective 
plight. When the media report that stud ents 
blocked an intersection to protest ri sing 
tuition, listeners can't help but hear "rising 
nlition" along with "blocked an intersec-
tion." 

It is as much a goal to raise awareness 
about the price of education , reasons for war 
or a presidential candidate 's questionable 
actions as it is to actually lower fees, stop the 
war or force a candidate to be honest. With 
every new group of people made aware of an 
issue, there are a few converts who will 
choose to do something about it. By getting 
people to pay attention, every protest is a suc-
cess, including UCSD's. After all - you're 
reading this, aren't you? 

will have any effect. Is the stllte 
Legislature any more likely to follow Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's compact agreement 
with colleges now that San Diego students 
inconvenienced motorists for a few minutes? 
And more importantly, does a protest even 
make any impression on most Americans 
today? 

Unfortunately, the answer is probably no. 
Protesting these days is utilized so frequently 
that it 's almost on par with a social activi ty. 
An1ericans expect people to protest, and 
rarely are they let down. Protesting makes for 
a good news Story and an interesting spectll-
cle, but no longer inspires the awe it used to. 
Byand large, this attitude can be traced to the 
overuse of protests for issues ami causes that 
are ambiguous at best, trivial at worst. The 
student protests over budget cuts and rising 
student fees last week are a perfect example. 
Yes, students already pay enough for their 
education and yes, any increase in fees will 
make maintaining or obtaining that education 
more difficult. But can that really compare to 
the civil rights movement protesting against 
hundreds of years of oppression, bigotry and 
racism? Can it compare to the whole nation of 
India struggling against centuries of colonial 
rule? Not really, although many protestors 
must believe the righteousness of their cause 
is on par with such historical movements. 

televisions, most Americans were 
not terribly surprised that a bunch 

of young people and antiwar activists were 
protesting again. After all, protests are pretty 
attractive activities, especially for students; 
not only will you be incorporated into a sup-
portive social group for participation, euphor-
ically getting to fulfill your social role of being 
young and rebellious, but you also get to be in 
the spotlight for as long as the publics atten-
tion lasts. Not bad - no wonder they occur 
so frequently ami so often that going to a 
protest is almost like going to the county fair. 

In a political science course last quarter, 
my professor detailed how the Iraq war is the 
most politically decisive and unpopular war 
in this century. With the 19605 war protests 
in mind, this puzzled me. After class, I 
inquired why, with such a potent and critical 
issue, the impact of these protests did not 
reach the level and intensity of those in the 
Viemam era. He gave me a wry smile and 
said, "There was no draft in this war." 
Perhaps. the youthful rebellion of righteous-
ness has always been fraught with this ele-
ment of self- interest after all. However, it is 
unfortunate that almost all protests these 
days have such shallow aspects to them, for if 
protests were more seriously and more spar-
ingly utilized. they could actually make a 
statement. As of now, they are just ~ specta-
cle.

UCSD's contradict.ions and hypocrisy offset by the 
efforts of truly visionary, enlightened professors 

returned 
yank 

Chris Taylor 

I n some respects, the phrase "Returned Yank" does not accu-
rately present what this column 

has attempted to achieve. The 
phrase is used in Ireland to refer to 
Irish who immigrated to America, 
only to return fattened up and sporr-
ing pockets brimming with money. 
By the time of their rerum, these 
Irish are more "yanlc" than "mics," 
and thus they are derided as such by 
their peers. 

I am not an Irish citizen, nor are 
my pockets brimming with money; 
however this phrase still proves 
useful to the column, if only in a 
metllphorical sense. For everyone 
who will be graduating in two 
weeks, we will be returning to the 
real world, brimming with knowl-
edge and fattened on idealism. For 
many, we will be derided as college 
students who don't have any under-
standing of the workings of real 
life. 

With the apprehension of real . 
life that undoubtedly occurs with 
every graduating senior, it is tempt-
ing to review the four years spent 
submerged in a university. 
Unfortunately, in my case, it is also 
tempting to. shower my thoughts 
onto what's left of my readership. 

Four years ago, fresh out of a ' 
fundamentalist Christian high 
school, wherein using the Lord's 
name vainly was grounds for apul-
sion, I was starved for anyone who 

valued knowledge above religious 
masochism. What I found, and 
what I have learned over the course 
of four years, is that my high school 
and this institution of higher learn-
ing are not terribly different. Both 
are places of exaggerated contra-
diction and relative dislike for 
rhyme or reason. 

Christian high schools are 
notorious for their judgmental 
nature. One might think that uni-
versities are less judgmental, as 
they value intellectual discourse 
and often a bit of moral ambigui-
ty. This is not the case at all. 
There is enough self-righteous-
ness at UCSD to keep Pat 
Robertson happy. The amount of 
blame-placing and high moral 
grounds is, at times, astounding. I 
have been called selfish by more 
people than I can count because I 
don't blindly agree with heavy-
handed tactics of "social responsi-
bility" and other government-
enforced charities. I have often 
wondered how this is any differ-
ent from being called a sinner for 
not believing in an American 
Christian theocracy. 

Christian schools claim to sup-
port the forgiveness and love of 
Jesus and yet, with iron-fisted 
rules, anyone can tell that the 
opposite is true. Likewise, univer-
sities embrace tolerance and diver-
sity, yet they only embrace the 
dive.rsity of a few special interest 
groups and vaguely defined races. 
Tolerance is only allowed for those 
views that are acceptable. Even 
worse, statistics are twisted to pre-
sent supposedly intellectual facts, 
such as in the recent report from 
the Office of the Registrar, where-
in many argue that because 

women are "underrepresented" in 
the science and engineering fields, 
there must be something wrong 
wi th those fiel ds. 

Christian schools, especially 
some of the more backwards 
schools in the South, claim to hate 
racism, yet there is a strange sense 
that there is still racial resentment 
beneath the public statements of 
the school. 

UCSD talks of the Principles of 
the Community and does indeed 

" Real Ufe awaits, and hopefully it will be 
everything it should be: 

Just an exaggerated 
contradiction, as college 

was. " 

enforce them in cases of their 
choosing, such as all instances of 
the iVNIiIJ controversy. However, 
the administration freely let the 
Muslim Student Association wave 
the Israeli flag next to a swastika 
last month in a Library Walk dis-
play - an act that would obviously 
offend Jews with any relationship 
to the Holocaust. 

It is ironic that universities, 
which have done so much to pro-
mote peace and understanding 
between Muslims and ignorant 
Americans after Sept. II, are the 
place where some are allowed to 
practice the most vitriol and hate. 

However, despite all the,se con-

tradictions and my own frustration 
at attending a university where rea-
son and intellect are often thrown 
out the window, UCSD is still a 
wonderful place. Friends made 
over the course of these four years 
are often likely to be friends long 
into the future. The research is 
world-renowned and UCSD pro-
fessors are some of the most intelli-
gent people in the country. The 
endless amount of organizations 
and activities presented on campus 
allow students to find out what 
they want our of life. 

Despite the existence of people 
who support ignorance and agen-
das over intellectual discourse, 
there are people on this campus 
who truly bring a feeling of what 
universities are supposed to be 
like. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Provost Cecil Lytle, who put 
much of his time and effort into 
the unrivaled Preuss school, shows 
how far intelligent concern and 
compassion can go. He does this 
while stunning crowds on his 
piano and being a steady lifeline to 
students abroad in England and 
Ireland. 

While controversial and often 
politicized, professors like 
William O'Brien of the Literature 
department - who teaches 
Revelle College humanities classes 
- still care more about their stu-
dents thinlcing rather than blindly 
believing anything they say. 

Political science professors like 
Victor Magagna allow students to 
truly decide what they agree with, 
as all aspects of the discussion are 
presented. 

Ecology professor David 
Holway, who permits nearly every 

Ecology, Behavior and Evol uti on 
student to volunteer in his lab, is a 
paragon of intellectual discourse. 
For the sake of truly enlightened 
teaching, he will even offer the 
potential advantages of genetically 
modified foods, an often politi cal-
ly disagreeable topic to ecologists. 

Metabolic biochemistry profes-
sor Randy Hampton will lie on the 
ground pleading with you not to 
smoke, or go on the Atkins di et 
during the course to give you a live 
case study, but will nor neglect one 
minute aspect of metaboli sm, 
much to the dismay of his students 
but to the delight of inte lligentsia. 

Despite the highly visible and 
often disgusting aspects of the uni-
versity, there are surely many peo-
ple who make this campus amazing 
who I didn't have the opportunity 
to meet. In this sense, despite my 
own jaded outlook on universities 
and my disappointment that so 
many of our peers and authorities 
have rejected knowledge for trends 
or emotions, thi s university has 
provided me with opportunities 
and outlets for desire, should I only 
want to grab them. 

In many ways, it is terri fyi ng to 
leave the soft bubble of the ideal -
istic campus, as any graduate 
might tell you. But, as in most 
phases of life, it will only be 
humiliating to cQntinue to stay, 
knowing that I'm already fin ished . 
Real life awaits, and hopefully it 
will be everything it should be: 
just an exaggerated contradiction, 
as college was. Go nth'; an bothar 
Itllt. SUi" go foill.

rm I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Triton Taxi a waste of 

students' money 
Editor: 

Marianne Madden seems to be 
making two points in her piece in 
the May 17 G,ulrtlunr, "Watson 
wrong abour Triton Taxi" - both 
of which can be summarized as 
advocacy for responsible students 
being forced to pay for transpona-
tion for the drunk and irresponsi-
ble. First she defends the program 
in general, and second she attacks 
Vice Chancellor of Srudent Affairs 
Joseph W Watson's rejection of 
making Triton Taxi waivers avail-
able online. To the fonner, it is 

" 

confusing facilitation and causa-
tion. Of course Watson does not 
claim that the existence of the 
Triton Taxi program is the sole rea-
son for student drinking, but rather 
Triton Taxi facilitates (or aids, if a 
definition is needed) off-campus 
drinking. As the A.S. representative 
to the Registration Fee Committee 
- an organization that distributes 
millions of dollars of student fees 
- it seems ludicrous to me that 
Associated Students would waste 
money on providing students with 
transponation from an off-campus 
site that it has no ability to control 
or govern. Perhaps if the off-cam-
pus binge drinking facilities would 

agree to adhere to 
sim{>ly ludicrous to 
suggest that a sig-
nificant number of 
rides provided by 
Triton Taxi are for 
students participat-
ing in off-campus, 
nonalcohol-related 
events. If, in fact, 
students are going 
to off-campus 
bridge or knitting 
clubs and need rides 
bacle to campus, I 
apologize, and I am 
sure Watson would 
re-eva luate his 
stance. The fact, 
however, is that 

. .. responsibility for 
irresponsible actions 
should be placed at 

UCSD bylaws or 
the university 
coul d oversee the 
activities that 
occur there, trans-
portation would 
be warranted . If 
UCSD student 
fees are going to 
shuttling students 
to off-campus 
drinking-fests, we 
should at least be 
given some over-
sight as to what 
the party's facilita-
tors' intentions are 
with underage sru-

the foot of the 
tvwtirifvm t II 
.f""'A" """".t"""... .." 

- Chlirles OWn, A,S, 
nUtive R~Ition~ 

'rommittee 

Triton Taxi provides students living 
on campus - most of whom are 
underage - an opportunity to 
engage in binge drinking with 
strangers in private residences off 
campus. As we saw May 21, when 
UCSD's Associated Srudents spent 
$160,000 of our money for the 
musical styling of Busta Rhymes, et 
aI ., there are plenty of opportuni-
ties for on-campus debauchery. 

To the latter, Madden claims 
that Watson stated the Triton Taxi 
program "causes" alcohol con-
sumption, when in fact he said (as 
she quotes), "It is a program to 
facilitate the consumption of alco-
hoI." While Madden claims that 
Watson is, "confusing the direction 
of causation," it is Madden who is 

dents. 
Madden twists Watson's words. 

attempting to make him sound 
careless and that he causes students 
to kill themselves by driving drunk. 
I appreciate Watson's concern not 
for the irresponsible participants of 
binge drinking, but for those of us 
students who work dozens of hours 
per week to pay for our education 
and do not want to see it wasted on 
providing chauffeurs for the drunk. 
Responsibility for irresponsible 
actions should be placed at (he foot 
of the participant, not his or her 
vice chancellor or his or her peers 
who see better uses for their stu-
dent fees.

Cardio: Thornton Hospital also to expand 
cOlUinwtd from /lCJgt 3 

expand outpatient care and clinical 
research programs." 

According to Leslie Franz, direc-
tor of health sciences communica-
tions, about 16 percent of patients 
discharged from hospitals in the San 
Diego county in 2002 had cardio-
vascular-related health problems, 
and the number is expected to rise 
to 18 percent by 2012. 

"As the population increases 
and the population of older people 
increases, the number of people 
with cardiovascular problems will 
increase as well," Franz said. 

Thornton Hospital, which 
opened in 1993, will also be 
expanding its ~lities and services 
due to pressing capacity issues. 
According to both Franz and 
Holmes, the hospital is often oper-
ating at capacity in several areas due 
to the fact that San Diego has one 
of the fastest-growing and also one 

of the fastest-aging populations. 
"We're anticipating an increased 

demand for our health care ser-
vices," Franz said. 

The expansion proposal 
includes the addition of 12 to 24 
intensive care beds, an expansion of 
the emergency rooms, the addition 
of operati ng rooms and new car-
diac catheterization labs. 
Additional physicians will also be 
recruited. 

"If our [Intensive Care Unit] 
'beds are filled with critically ill 
patients, we may have to postpone 
elective surgeries until an ICU bed 
is available," Holmes said. "Also, 
the growing demand on our emu-
gmcy services will lead to longer 
waits." 

According to Holmes, UCSD is 
in a unique position to provide 
quality health care to the local 
community. 

"As the region's only university 

health system, we have the unique 
obligation and opporrunity to serve 
the community with the most 
advanced care, highly specialized 
services and access to clinical trials 
that offer promising new therapies 
for people who may have failed con-
ventional treatment," Holmes said. 

Franz concurred with Holmes 
on the imponance of the university 
in the medical setting. 

"Our mission is to conduct 
research and to bring the latest 
advances into the patient care set-
ting that is really unique to the uni-
versity setting," Franz said. 

Completed plans for the new 
center and the hospital's expansion 
will be presented to the Regents 
within a year for 6nal approval. 
According to Franz, construction 
for the Cardiovascular Center and 
the expansion of the hospital ide-
ally will be completed by mid-
2008.

Sun God: Students gather at Price Center 
continued /ram page I 

Peterson. 
At the same time, many students 

gathered around the 33 stmds set 
up on Sun God lawn, which includ-
ed a tarot card reader. 

Students competed for prize at 
the "Send the Aliens Home" game 
set up by Darlcstar, the campus sci-
ence fiction and gaming club. 

"We've been getting a lot of 
people. People lik.e the little aliens 
- they're cute," said Chris Severs, 
an Earl Warren Col.lege junior and 
president of Darlc.star. 

Several booths away, Student 
Health advocates urged passersby 
to "pin the condom on the man" in 
a game using a bull's-eye painted 
onto a large drawing of a man 
aimed at promoting sexual aware-
ness, according to participating 
ERC sophomore Angela Gazali. 

In a separate contest at the 
booth, students guessed the quanti-
ty of assorted condoms in a large jar 
for a chance to win them all. 

Nearby, a group from off cam-
pus dressed in traditional Chinese 
clothing and meditated to demon-
strate the practice of Falun Dafa. At 
the booth, students were also asked 
to sign a petition a Icing for the 
release of an American citizen 
allegedly imprisoned by the 

Chinese government for his partic-
ipation in the practice. 

"On one hand, we're promoting 
the exercise, but on the other we're 
also promoting the awareness of 
the persecution in China," said 
Chung Lien, a graduate student 
and president of the Falun Dafa 
club. 

Some students also played in a 
large bounce house and an inflat-
able boxing ring set up nen to a 
challenge course. 

Many also tallred about a large 
ornamental phallus attached to the 
Sun God statue, complete with a 
functioning water hose that sprayed 
water at students on a slip 'n' slide 
below. 

John Muir College junior Steve 
York. said he had sculpted the phal-
lus for an art class and had planned 
to put it up himself, though he said 
that he did not mow who actually 
set it up. 

Members of The KJJ.Ja, includ-
ing editor in chief Bryan Barton, 
took credit for the installation, say-
ing that campus administrators 
were at first opposed to the idea but 
finally acquiesced. 

"My main concern was whether 
the statue was damaged, and it 
appears no damage was done," said 
Stuart Art Collection Director 

Mary Beebe, explaining that she 
left the decision abom the addition 
to Sun God organizers. 

At I p.m., students gathered in 
front of Geisel Library to watch the 
first-annual Triton Junlc.yard 
Der!Jy, inspired by the television 
show "Jun1cyard Wars" and co-
sponsored by the UCSD Alumni 
Association and the Triton 
Engineering Student Council. 

Participating students used 
scraps from a junlc.yard at Physical 
Plant Services and help from alum-
ni to construct boxcars used for the 
race. 

"We've been loolc.ing for a cre-
ative way to bring alumni back. to 
Sun God, which is a great event, 
and add just something that's really 
spirited," said John Valva, execu-
tive director of the Alumni 
Association. 

In the final race, liberal am 
team Darlc.side beat out the engi-
neering team Constitution by less 
than one second to win the "per-
petual trophy," made from an old 
road sign. 

For Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Sandeep Choulc.sey, the most 
enjoyable part of Sun God was 
other people. 

"It was all about mingling and 
all about togetherness," he said. 

God 2004 
Concert: Students skydive onto field 
contm ued /ram page r 

After Clipse finished their set, 
indie band the Moving Units drew 
audiences to the side stage with 
thei r disco-punk sound. The band 
which had played at the Coachella 
festival on May I, was familiar to 
many in the dancing crowd. 

In the meantime, many were 
entertained by the other attractions 
RIMAC Field had to offer. Food 
options included pizza, hamburg-
ers, kettle corn and funnel cake; 
concertgoers lined up in between 
acts. Others enjoyed inflatable 
slides and climbing walls, trampo-
lines and other carnival attractions 
between the sets. 

At 9 p.m., students headed back 
to the main stage when ska-punk 
band Goldfinger played. The band 
opened with the theme to "Rocky," 
featuring a basketball-jersey-and 
thong-wearing drummer, Darrin 
Pfeiffer, before launching into the 
music. During the set, the band 
played a string of familiar songs 
and covers. Lead singer Kelly 
Lemieux told the crowd that they 
loved San Diego for the "great surf, 
beautiful women and crowds." 

Lemieux had said before the 
show that the band promised "par-
tial nudity, fire and violence," some 
of which came true during the set. 
Pfeiffer, still clad in a Kobe Bryant 
bask.etball jersey and thong, took. 
centerstage to sing the Darlc.ness' "I 
Believe in a Thing Called Love," 
and during the band's last song, the 
cymbals on the drum set were lit on 
fire. 

Toward the end of the set, 
Lemieux said that he wanted to see 
how drunk. the crowd was and 
aslc.ed someone to come on stage 
and eat a Twinkie out of Pfeiffer's 
behind. One attendee volunteered 
to do so, ate half the 1Winkie and 

leapt back into the crowd. Pfeiffer 
ate the other ha I f. 

Ska band RX Bandits were the 
last to play at the side stage, help-
ing warm up the crowd for Busta 
Rhymes. 

"I really enjoyed RX Bandits 
because of their type of music," 
Eleanor Roosevelt College student 
Je sica Mefford said. 

At 10;30 p.m., the crowd started 
heading over to the main stage to 
listen to Busta Rhymes. After a half 
hour of listening to the OJ spin and 
play to the crowd, Busta took the 
stage at 11 p.m. After his first song, 
Busta started to yell at the crowd. 

"Get your motherfuclc.ing hands 
up," he said, waiting for the crowd 
to obey before he proceeded with 
the music. 

"Busta Rhymes was worse than I 
thought he'd be because he insult-
ed the crowd, the OJ was awful and 
there were pauses during all the 
songs," Earl Warren College stu-
dentJen Water said. 

Others enjoyed the music. 
"I'm having a good time," 

Palomar College student Carlos 
Aldrete said. "Busta Rhymes is my 
favorite." 

During his hour-long set, Busta 
played many of his popular songs, 
heckled the crowd for not mowing 
the lyrics to his songs and demand-
ed that the crowd share "all the 
weed." 

Most students said they enjoyed 
the concert, but a few showed some 
discontent. 

"Sun God was fun, but overall, 
there needs to be better contrOl of 
the crowd," Thurgood Marshall 
College student Susan Ung said. 

Ung .dded that many who were 
at the front of the stage from the 
beginning of Sun God were pushed 
to the bedr. once BUSbI Rhymes 

took the stage. 
"Having no beer garden is a 

joke," John Muir College student 
Blake Davidoff said. 

However, many said they 
enjoyed the concert regardless. 

"The show was fun , as always," 
Marshall student Tassia Cardona 
said. "It's a chance for UCSD to 
stop being geeks and just chill 
out." 

Organizers were also pleased 
with the event. Shah, who served 
as A.S. festivals co-coordinator 
before recently taking over as com-
missioner, credited University 
Events Office production manager 
Steve Evans, who dealt with the 
concert's sound and security 
among other tasks, with much of 
the event's success. This was 
Evans' last year after helping with 
the concert for 15 years, according 
to Shah. 

The side stage in particular was 
a big success, according to Alex 
Kushner, the outgoing A.S. com-
missioner of programming who 
was recently replaced by Shah. 

"We just started the idea last 
year and expanded it this year by 
adding national touring artists," 
Kushner said. "It was amazing. The 
entire crowd was moving from one 
stage to another throughout the 
night." 

Kushner said the show, from the 
production standpoint, went 
smoothly. 

"It was one of the smoothest 
events in my four years here, from 
the daytime events to the nighttime 
events," Kushner said. "Every band 
would get off the stage and be lik.e, 
'That was amazing.' Goldfinger 
said that this was one of the most 
amazing crowds they had played to. 
It was just bisBer and betur than it 
everwu."

ItJs not just the thought that counts 
Great wish list 

ideas for graduates 
abol'e and 

beyond the vesC/J 
key chain and 

license-plate frame 
When 'graduation rolls around, people usually think. of caps, gowns and 
diplomas that will end up in a box 
collecting dust under the bed, free 
food they'll get at parties after the 
ceremonies, and the fact that 

er haft to it IfIro8gh 
another boring lecture again - at 
least for the next three months 
until graduate school starts. 
Graduation is a major celebration 
of onc's accomplishments, so 
think of it as a second Christmas 
- only this time, instead of Santa 
Claus rewarding you for being a 
good little girl or boy, it's your 
friends and relatives. 

Whether you're already plan-
ning your list or not, you're going 
to get a sack. of presents. For all the 
opportunists out there, thi article 
will provide insight and profession-
al savvy necessary to composing the 
ideal wish list for yourself and a 
shopping list for your friends . 

The first thing you've got to 
admit to yourself is that you don't 
want to be IiIre other recent gradu-
ates who find themselves accosted 
with cheap memorabilia; UCSD k.ey 
chains, lapel pins, pencils, dog tags, 
whistles, coffee mugs, coasters, ball 
caps, ties, socIc.s, license-plate frames, 
bumper stick.ers, career-themed 
teddy bears, chocolate bars with edi-

ble pictures of Geisel Library on 
them and seat cushions. 
Chances are you already have 
enough of these and you don't 
want any more. You might get a 
laugh or two out of them, but 
inevitably they'll end up in your next 
garage sale. If you need to look at a 
stuffed owl with a graduation cap on 
it to remind you of all your hard 
work as a student, so be it. But those 
who hope to receive what they truly 
desire make a list of both what they 
want tmd do not want An overabun-
dance of things that read "Class of 
2004" justify a "Do Not Gift" list. 

I Iopefully you will land a well-
paying job after graduation. Let's 
face it, though - there are a lot of 
recent graduates paniclcing because 
they don't Ic.now the first thing 
about what they want to do or how 
they can tum their academic Ic.now-
how into practical , real-world 
assets. If this is the case, you might 
want to start a small library of self-
help and career-development 
boob. Great-aunt Hortense will be 
happy to give you a copy of Po 
Bronson's "What Should I Do 
With My Life?" (514.95) and 
Uncle Manny might select the 
widely popularized "What Color Is 
Your Parachute?" (517.95) by Dick 
Bolles. Don't underestimate these 
gifts and throw them in the deep

could be valuable 
tools that help you to 
assess and re-evalu-
ate your career path 
in a way that will 
leave you with a 
new vision. 

lf you can 't 
bring yourself to 
crack another 
book, consider 
aski ng your close 
friend and fami-
ly members to help you fulfill a 
dream you've always had . Even if 
you've never made the "Things to 
Do Before] Die" list, we all have 
a running mental itinerary of 
experiences that we'd lik.e to have 
but never had the courage, the 
time or the money to do. Well, 
now's your big chance. As a col-
lege graduate, you are uninhibit-
ed. You're leaving one chapter in 
your life and opening another. 
What better way to fill that empty 
page between chapters than with a 
hang-gliding lesson or a ttip to 
some exotic locale? If you have 
never known life outside of 
UCSD's academic bubble, this 
present is one you must grant 
yourself - at the expense of oth-
ers. A vacation planned with fam-
ily or friends can help cement 
relationships and provide a neces-
sary breather before you move 
into the real world of a 9-to-5 job 
and a regular salary. 

It is possible to have a relaxing 
vacation without leaving San 
Diego. Ask. for the royal treatment 
with a ~ day. Hour-long massages 
generally run $75 to $95, depend-
ing on whether you want a 
Swedish, deep tissue, aromathera-
py, hot stone or shiatsu massage.

scrubs, facials or pedicures. Each 
spa differs in th.e services offered,

Beauty Kliniek in University City

mate site on Governor Drive

10 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

., I THE EDITORS' SOAPBOX 
UCSD has traditions of its own 

Guardian gives the Koala a sloshball beating 
By EVAN MCLAUGHUN 

Editor in Chief 

Robert C. Dynes, former 
chancellor and current Arnold 
Schwarzeneggcr co-star in c1osed-
door productions, once referred 
to UCSD in a State of the 
Campus address as having a "tra-
dition of no tradition." The 
maxim he used was to illustrate 
the innovative attitude UCSD 
boasts, not necessarily that the 
campus community lacked a lega-
cy it could be proud of, or that it 
was unwilling to put forth the 
effort to get one started. 
Howe,;er, he may be on to some-
thing - at least in regards to our 
stagnant student life . 

On May 21, UCSD students 
pretended otherwise, though, 
ditching class to fly down a slip 'n' 
slide on Sun God Lawn, drink 
Red Hoole at Porters Pub, and get 
crazy on RIMAC Field to a lineup 
of bad-ass bands. 

The GUllrdill7l staff has its own 
tradition on Sun God. We're up at 
the crack of dawn to eat cheap 
breakfast and drink mimosas at 
Broken Yolk Cafe. Our table 
buzzes with whatever amount of 
excitement we can muster up at 7 
a.m., and we line our stomachs 
with eggs, hash browns and toast 
that will (attempt to) subdue the 
alcohol consumed during the day. 
The 2 I-and-up crowd then heads 
next door to the Silver Fox for an 
eye-opener with "the regulars." 
Afterward, we hitch a ride to cam-
pus, turned loose on the booths, 
the Pub and anywhere else where 
fun/spirits can be found before 
heading into the concen. 

Thi year was pretty much the 
same as every year, which doesn't 
sound that interesting, though I 
really wish I could rehash more of 
my memory from that day. There 
was Adam and 'Hart Attack tack-
ling trash cans like they were the 
Steel Curtain defense. Busta 
Rhymes called me and the other 
thousands in attendance, to our 
enjoyment, "pussies," "bitches," 
"weak bi tches," "motherfuckers" 
and "weak motherfuckers. It The 
Moving Units rocked, the Pub 
and Round Table were hopping in 
the daytime, and the sports office 
fridge had enough suds stocked 
inside to clean a barge. 

Sun God is a great tradition, 

and a fun one at that, but the most 
anticipated ritual the GJUlrdill7l 
staff partakes in (except maybe our 
Vegas trip) is the sloshball game 
against the controversial and 
loathed KNJ4 staff. 

The rivalry has existed as long 
as the twO publications have, and 
records show that the slosh ball 
contest, regularly played the day 
immediately following the Sun 
God festival, has lasted longer 
than a decade. After being largely 
incommunicado with the Koa/Il 
heathens during the school year 
- despite our offices being right 
down the hall from each other -
we get down and diny to duke it 
out on the slosh ball field. We 
show up, they show up, and 
worlds collide. 

This year was no different. 
Many of us were looking for 
blood - whether it was to avenge 
the losses we suffered in the last 
cwo years, or to floss with Bryan 
Barton's bones (as was Rugby Jill's 
plan), we came to play, drink and 
kick some ass. 

The battle royale got off to a 
late start, as the venue for the game 
was unknowingly changed from the 
Kearney Mesa Recreation Center 
to University City High School. 
The game was a few hours behind 
schedule when we showed up with 
our keg, and the KotJ'" insisted that 
their keg would arrive when ours 
ran out, which came back to bire 
them in the ass later. I agreed with 
George, the Karl Rove of the l<DtUR 
operation, that the game would end 
when the keg ended. KNJ4 editor in 
chief Bryan Banon, unfonunately, 
couldn't make it to the game, much 
to our chagrin. He was reportedly 
attending a funeral in his home-
town, a valid excuse, but some of 
his staff confided that he usually 
doesn't show up to these things 
anyway. Totally weale. 

Meanwhile, Koaill staffer 
Sammy had a Die Hard battery 
hooked up to his mouth and was . 
running it nonstop, only to get 
scorched in the drink-off by Jill. 
We elected to have first ups, and 
our iineup looked pretty solid. 

Solid enough, in fact, to snap a 
two-year losing streak, as the 
GUIlrditm took the first game, 10-9. 
After the first keg was cashed, the 
game was called, per our pre-game 
aggreement, but not without dis-
pute. The Knakl tried every loop-

hole they could think of, even sug-
gesting a quarter flip to determine 
whether we would resume the 
game upon the next keg's arrival. 
We knew we won, they knew they 
won - but being the type of pests 
they are, we agreed to settle it 
through a drink-off. Rugby Jill 
again cleaned up and the GutmJian 
officially took game I. 

And it didn't matter because we 
trampled over the KNill in game 2 
by a 35-20 margin. The balls were 
flying off our bats, I won my first 
ever sloshball drinkoff to settle a 
play at first (a career goal finally 
marked off my UCSD checklist), 
KDIlJ4 hooligans Sanuny and E-
Dogg fought each other right after 
E-Dogg did a Greg Louganis into 
the mud (the sprinklers had inad-
vertantly switched on d\:ring game 
2, adding some eXtra "slosh" to the 
COOlest). Greg, Rinaldo, Ian and 
Tom had been putting the keg 
away the Milwaukee way, and by 
the middle of game 2 were acting 
as the enforcers in between 
Nordic keg tosses. llIustrators Bo 
Rhino, Danny and Raty were hit-
ting the cover off the ball, inde-
pendent candidate Bryce Warwick 
captained the outfield, and Jill, 
well, she won almost every drink-
off, ate mustard out of the bottle 
and beat the shit ouf a trash can. 
Hands down, Jill was the sloshbaIJ 
MVP. 

But as for the Koa"': good 
game, losers. We beat you in every 
facet of the game, out-drinking 
you guys, winning the serums 
near home plate, and making 
plays in the field. After the pum-
meling you took this year, there is 
no denying the rivalry is still alive 
and well. And that's a tradition I'm 
proud to be a pan of.

Are there negative effects 
related to running? 

to your 
health 

Neha Si..., 
Are there any harmful side 
effects to running or jogging? 

-Anonymous 

Running and jogging have 
gained a lot of popularity over the 
years. With treadmills, tracks and 
trails nearly everywhere you go, it 
is almost impossible not to spend a 
chunk of time huffing and puffing 
away in the name of exercise. 
However, it is possible to overwork 
your body. 

According to the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, 
overuse injuries most often occur 
because of a runner's training 
error (running too

lliotibial bad syadrome: 

Symptoms of this syndrome include 
pain or aching of the knee, usually 
occurring in the middle or at the 
end of I run. When you flex and 
enend your knee, the iliotibial band, 
which runs along the outside of the 
thigh, can become irritated &om 
repetitively rubbing the knee. There 
are several causes of this syndrome, 
including weak gluteal muscles, 
bowed legs, leg length discrepancy 
and running on uneven surfaces. 
Running on a cin:uIar track may also 
contribute to the problem. As with 
other running injuries, athletes with 
iliotibial band syndrome should 
decrease their training regimen. In 
addition, they should add stretches 
for the outside of their thigh to their 
warmup program, avoid running on 
uneven or circular track surfaces, 
and some should wear motion-con-
trol running shoes.

serious over time if not properly 
treated. Here is a list of some 
common injuries the academy 
says can occur due to running: 

Runner's knee: This is the 
most common running-related 
injury. Also known as patello-
femoral pain, runner's knee is irri-
tation of the cartilage in the 
kneecap. While ~ning, various 
mechanical conditions may pre-
dispose runners to a weak 
kneecap. This can result in irrita-
tion andlor damage to the 
kneecap. Runners will notice pain 
near the kneecap, especially after 
sitting for extended periods of 
time with knees bent or while 
walking down stairs or downhill. 
Appropriate treatment involves 
eliminating or modifying activi-
ties that cause the pain, correct-
ing improper movements that 
allow the injury to arise and 
avoiding positions that further 

or strengthened properly. To care 
for shin splints, runners should 
decrease their training and begin 
with ice and rest, and later strength-
en the lower leg muscles. They may 
use swimming and bilcing as alterna-
tive fonns of exercise. 

Achilles tendonitis: The 
Achilles tendon is the connection 
becween the heel and the muscles of 
the lower leg. Several factors con-
tribute to ·the development of 
Achilles tendonitis, including exces-
sive hill running, sudden increases in 
training and improper shoes. One of 
the major symptoms is excessive 
tightness of the posterior muscles of 
the leg, including the calf muscles 
and the hamstrings. Runners with 
this condition should reduce their 
running, and use ice and gende 
stretching to reduce paift and tight-
ness. If not treated properly, Achilles

Grads: Great gifts can be 
found for a variety of prices 

continued from page 9 
include their sage advice and sen-
timental remembrances in a jour-
nal to go along with the visual aid. 
Hint: More people helping means 
the costs are split between every-
one. 

If you are feeling creative, there 
are always those fun, funky gift 
ideas. This is not to say a musical 
toilet is a good idea, but rather 
something that stands out can 
always be effective. Try something 
like a tie from a thrift store to con-
gratulate him on his entrance into 
the corporate world, or a pair of 
galoshes if she's moving to 
Washington - anything that fits 
their new calling. 

When all else fails, make a nice, 
warm batch of chocolate-chip 

cookies (or favorite comfort food) . 
After all, friendship cannot be 
bought and everyone likes cookies. 

Ultimately, the best gift you will 
receive at graduation is a sense of 
deep accomplishment and rride in 
finishing something wei done. 
This is a profound and self-gratify-
ing sense of achievement that 
nothing can equal. Chances are 
you cannot wait to leave the uni-
versity where you have spent the 
last four years of your life (or five, 
or six), but remember how in those 
years you proved to yourself that 
you could stand on your own cwo 
feet, shaped your identity and 
made an impact on the conununity 
around you. This is the sweetest 
reward of all. But make your list, 
just to be safe. 

Health: Injuries can occur 
without proper precautions 

coruirwedfram page /0 
tendonitis can develop into a chron-
ic problem. 

Heel pain (heel spurs and 
plantar fasciitis): The most com-
mon heel problems are caused by 
strain of the plantar fascia, a liga-
ment that extends &om the heel to 
the toes. The condition can cause 
swelling at the origin of the plantar 
fascia at the heel. 1be pain is most 
noticeable when the foot flattens 
during weightbearing or when push-
ing off with the toes during wallring 
or running. The problems tend to 
occur most frequcndy in flat, flexible 
feet and in high-arched stiff feet 
Left untreated, the pain can spread 
around the heel. Treannent should 
include a decrease in the intensity 

and duration of rwming workouts. 
Runners should also regularly evalu-
ate their running shoes for excessive 
wear and for proper fit. The wrong 
shoe for a foot type can worsen bie-
mechanical flaws and cause plantar 
fasciitis. 

Keeping these injuries in mind, 
it might be a good idea to vary your 
routine. Instead of jogging every 
day, try lesser-impact exercises like 
yoga and swimming. Doing this 
will have better long-term effects 
on your body and make your work-
out routine more interesting. 

Do you have any health-related 
queries? Feel free to e-mail Neha at

Tennis: 
UCSD loses 

No. 1 singles, 
doubles player 

ccmlinueci from J>a£e ,6 
No. 6 singles positions. Jensen is 
known by her teammates for 
being a great team leader and 
incredibly friendly. 

"Kristina is one of the nicest and 
friendliest girls I've ever met on the 
team," junior Jasmin Dao said. 
"Even when I was a freshman, she 
welcomed me with open arms and 
made me feel more comfortable. 
We played doubles together my 
freshman year and Kristina was 
always reassuring me and helping 
me out. She is one of the most opti-
mistic people I know." 

In addition to being mown as 
exceptionally friendly, Jansen has 
been commended for being a 
determined player with many 
memorable matches played during 
her four years at UCSD. 

With three seniors leaving this 
year, and two other team members 
taking leave to study abroad in 
2005, the Tritons will lose a total of 
five varsity players, but the promis-
ing group of incoming players gives 
the team promise. 

"We're going to miss them a lot 
on the court; they're always talking 
and encouraging us," said Dao, 
who will be the only senior on the 
team next year. "They get along 
with everyone and off the court 
they've been the ones we've looked 
up to. Not only will we miss them 
as teammates, but as friends as 
well ."

After finishing the 2003-04 sea-
son as the No. 2 team in both 
Western (losing to Cal Poly 
Pomona) and English (to 
University of San Diego by just twO 
points) competitions, the UCSD 
equestrian team hopes to send both 
a team and as many individuals as 
possible to the annual Western 
Zones competition in 2005, which 
will be held in Oregon, and the 
national competition, which is 
scheduled to be hosted in Ohio. 

Triathlon 

Davis: Long history contributes to excellence On May 2, the UCSD triathlon team participated in the grueling 
Wildflower Triathlon, held annual-
ly at Lake San Antonio, Calif. The 
world-class course included a 1.5-
kilometer open-water swim, a 40K 
bike course over loping hill s, 
topped off by a 10K run. The best 
college triathletes from around the 
country competed for both individ-
ual and team honors. 

contin1led from page ,6 
Athletic Conference when Davis 
took charge. By WOO, there were 
56 student athletes in the pro-
gram. The men's varsity eight 
was nationally noteworthy and 
the women's program moved 
into third place at the NESCAC 
Championships before going on 
to place eighth at NCAA 
Division IIIIII Nationals. 

wColby is a cold place," Davis 
said. "'!'here were days at Colby 
when we would put the boats in 
the water and it would be 19 
degrees outside. We'd be rowing 
and ice would start to fonn on 
the hull of the boat." 

Davis left Colby in 2000, tak-
ing an assistant women's rowing 
coach position at Division I 
University of Texas, where he 
assumed full responsibility for 
high school recruiting. 

"I think that working at the 
University of Tens is as close to 
professional athleticism as any 
collegiate sports programs gets," 
Davis said. "The athletic depart-
ment there has to be one of the 
best in the country." 

Davis remembers when the 
. Longhorns qualified for the 2003 
National Championship Regana. 

"When the team found out 
that it had qualified for 
Nationals, the coaches went into 
the athletic deparunent to teU . 
them that we had made it," Davis 
said. wAiter we told the people in 
the office the news, they acted 
relieved and just said, 'finally:' It 
rums out that we were the last 

varsity sport that season to quali-
fy for Nationals. I just remember 
thinking to myself, wow, what if 
we didn't make it? Texas has a 
great staff and great student sup-
port." 

The Longhorns went on to 
finish 12th at the regana. 

Davis' knowledge of recruit-
ing and building deep programs 
will be essential in upcoming 
years at UCSD as the current, 
young team grows, though the 
strategy for doing so will be dif-
ferent than it was at Division 1 
Texas. 

"You're recruiting a different 
kind of athlete in Division 1 and . 
Division II," Davis said. "I am 
more focused on the walk-on 
athlete as opposed to recruiting. 
I've talked to some hi gh school 
coaches who saw our team's per-
formance this season, and they 
are interested in UCSD as a row-
ing school." 

But Davis' ambition for the 
future of Triton men's rowing is 
more anchored in consistency 
than recruiting for a single pow-
erful class. 

"My biggest long-term goal 
for this team is just to be consis-
tendy strong year-in and year-
out," Davis said . "That's the 
hardest thing. Being on top for 
one or two years is hard, but con-
sistency over several years is dif-
ficult. " 

In order for UCSD to remain 
a threatening team to its compe-
tition, Davis plans to try to 
recruit athletes who are already

at UCSD that might already 
have some experience playing 
other sports in high school. 

"My main goal for the future 
is to have more retention," Davis 
said. "I want to get more upper-
classmen to lead the team and to 
serve as role models for the 
younger classes. 1 want those 
guys to be the ones to show 
young athletes that they can keep 
playing sports and become a bet-
ter athlete and better person." 

If the 2004 team is any indica-
tion of the outlook for UCSD 
rowing, then Davis has plenty to 
look forward to. 

"I didn't have any expecta-
tions for this team right away, 
but they really wanted to push 
themselves," he said. "[ would 
push them and they would just 
push back harder and demand to 
work harder. Every time 1 pushed 
this team they just kept wanting 
more." 

If you happen to be at a regat-
ta before Davis' team races, his 
superstitions might make him 
the friendliest spectator present. 

"As a coach, I just have to sit 
back and watch the race," Davis 
said. "I don't do anything to 
cause my team to get any bad 
karma before the race. I open 
doors for people and use my best 
manners. You just get used to 
knowing that there's nothing you 
can do as a coach when your 
team is l'3cing. I am supersti-
tious, though. I also keep my 
stopwatch with me at all times 
on race day." 

On the men's side, John Burke 
finished in 13th place with an 
overall time of 2 hours, 17 min-
utes, 3 seconds. Burke 's 10K run 
time of 35:47 was the best posted 
time of the day. 

UCSD teammate Brend an 
O'B~ien was close behind, fini shing 
23rd with a time of 2:24:12 after 
running into problems during hi s 
first transition from the swim onto 
the bicycle. 

John Romais was the third fin-
isher for UCSD, posting a time of 
2:37:52 . 

The Triton women had a solid 
showing, with Natasha Cridler 
finish.ing fourth overalJ in a time 
of 2:3 5 :45 and Emily Va la-Haynes 
crossing shortly behind and taking 
eighth place in a time of 2:40:52 . 
Sharon Bergquist finished soon 
thereafter, completing the course 
in 2:45 :35 . 

UCSD's combined team time 
of 15:21 : 19 was fast enough to 
earn the Tritons fourth place 
overall among the eight·school 
field. 

The Triton triathlon team con-
tinues the season throughout the 
summer starting with their next 
competition at the San Jose 
Internanonal Triathlon on June 13 
at Lake Almaden, Calif..

I CWI SPORTS 
Equestrian 
heads to

By MAnHEW GRANT 

Associate Sports Editor 

In a single season, men's crew 
coach Mark Davis has helped an 
exceptionally young Triton men's 
crew program evolve from a mod-
est competitor in the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association, finishing the champi-
onship regatta ninth overall in 
2003, to a fifth-place overall fin-
isher in 2004. After the WIRA 
Championships, UCSD went on

to try its luck against the nation's 
best at the East Coast Athletic 
Conference National Invitational 
Regatta on May 8 and May 9, 
where the Tritons finished 14th 
but posted the fastest time of their 
season. 

Davis, a native of Cape Cod, 
Mass., was named head coach 
Sept. 9, 2003, to fill the place of 
Michael Filippone, who coached 
the team since 1997. 

Davis is the only member of his 
family who is involved in crew. But 
spending summers on beaches and 
vessels around Cape Cod sparked 
Davis' appreciation for boats and 
water sports. 

"I grew up on the ocean and on 
the water," Davis said. "That's 
where I had my first experience 
with boats." 

It was not until later in his high 
school career that Davis first start-
ed to row competitively with a 
team. 

"I started going to a boarding 
school in my junior year of high 
school," Davis said. "I was sick of 
playing soccer, which is what I'd 
done in the previous faU, and my 
new school had a rowing team." 

Davis went to Hobart College 
in Geneva, N .Y., where he pur-
sued his ambitions of collegiate 
rowing competition. 

" orne of my fondest memories 
from when I was rowing were of 
my practlce in college," Davis 
said. "We rowed on a canal in

seniors Sarah Bahlert, Julie 
Westerman and Kristina Jensen. 
Each played aU four years with the 
Tritons. Westerman, who served 
on the Triton Athletic Council in 
the 2003-04 academic year, and 
Jensen, who was on the Athletic 
Council during the 2002-03 acade-
mic year, led the team as co-cap-
tains in the 2004 campaign. 

"The seniors added a lot of 
maturity and experience to the 
team," head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. The girls looked up to them 
for advice and were a great pres-
ence on the team." 

Bahlert, from Aragon High 
School in San Mateo, Calif., played 
a handful of matches during her 
span with the team. Plagued by 
tendonitis in her wrist and knee 
surgery during her freshman year, 
she continued to play with determi-
nation to prove herself to her team-
mates and LaPlante. 

"Sarah was always there when 
we needed her," LaPlante said. 
"She was always ready to play and 
gave everyone a match. She's very 
competitive. Through her four 
years [as a Triton) she traveled with 
us a bit and was able to playa cou-
ple of matches earlier on." 

At No.1 singles and No.1 dou-
ble, Westerman will be greatly 
missed by her teammates in the 

2005 season. 
"Julie was a huge asset to the 

team," LaPlante said. "She came in 
as a freshman having had played a 
couple of tournaments before then. 
She wasn't even going to play col-
lege tennis when she first came, but 
she ended up trying out and played 
at No.6 her freshman year." 

Westerman, dubbed the 
"Queen of Three-Set Matches" 
her freshman year, was known for 
being the decisive match-game 
player at No. 6 her first year. 
Being the decisive-match player 
and salvaging wins gave 
Westerman confidence through 
her four years and improved her 
game. The Los Angeles native 
served as team captain for two 
years and led her team, alternating 
between No. I and No. 2 singles 
these last two years. 

"One ofJulie's most memorable 
moments was her first year at 
Regionals," LaPlante said. "We 
were in Hawaii playing Hawaii-
Pacific. The match came down to 
her singles match in the third set, 
and she beat a very strong girl on 
sheer determination. From then on 
we aU knew we could always rely on 
her to win matches. She's been a 
great leader and has added a lot of 
marurity and is welJ-liked by the 
team." 

. Jensen came on to the team as 
a highly ranked player from 
Northern California. Through 
her four years on the team, she 
has ranged between the No.3 and

upstate New York, which was just 
beautiful. I had a great coach and 
some of the best teammates that I 
could have had. A lot of those guys 
are stiH my closest friends today." 

A positive experience with his 
coach at Hobart left Davis con-
templating the possibility of 
becoming a high school teacher so 
that he could also coach a crew 
team and stay involved in the 
sport. 

"I think that some of the way 
that 1 coach is the result of the way 
that I was coached at Hobart," 
Davis said. "You want it to be 
more than just focusing on the 
competitions because you want 
the team to have fun with the 
practices, too." 

In 1993, Davis planned to 
assume an assistant coaching posi-
tion at Hobart and William Smith 
College, where he would lead 
novice men's and women's boats, 
then get his masters degree before 
finding a high school program to 
head up. 

"My original thought was to 
coach and teach at the high school 
level," Davis said. "I got a job at 
the college level, and I liked that 
because 1 could get a lot more 
done because there is so much 
more time. In high school, a coach 
only gets one season every year to 
work with the team, but in college, 
the team works year-round to get 
better." 

Changing IDS role from rower 

to coach meant not rowing in the 
boat with his teams like he did in 
the past. Rather, Davis had to get 
used to instructing instead of per-
fonning. 

"As a coach, I would go to 
workouts without working out, 
which was hard to get used to at 
first, but I have adapted and find 
time now to do my own work-
outs," Davis said. "Now I just like 
to go out [rowing] to be on my 
own. I like to be doing my thing of 
being on the water. It's a form of 
stress relief." 

In 1996, before he could get to 
his masters, Davis was offered a 
varsity head coaching position at 
Colby College in Waterville, 
Maine. 

While at Colby, Davis trans-
formed the struggling crew pro-
gram into a national competitor in 
only five years. 

"Some of my fondest memories 
of coaching are from when I was 
coaching at Colby College," Davis 
said. "The group there was a lot of 
fun . They were motivated and 
anxious to work hard. They were 
like the student body here in a lot 
of ways - everyone has the desire 
to excel and to work hard. It makes 
my job easy." 

Colby only had 18 members 
and the men's and women's pro-
grams were both in last place in 
the New England Small College

SENIOR SENDOFF 

The UCSD equestrian team 
sent three riders to compete in 
individual events at the 
Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association 2004 National Horse 
Show in Murfeesborough, Tenn. 
The three riders, senior Linda 
Torres, junior Shannon Ward and 
junior co-captain Marce Evans, 
qualified for Nationals after fin-
ishing in the top two of their 
respective classes in the Western 
Zone. 

Torres finished third in 
Intermediate Over Fences (2 feet, 
9 inch jumps) after having won 
her class at both the UCSD-host-
ed Southern California Regional 
Finals in March and West Coast 
Zone Finals last April in Twin 
Falls, Idaho. Ward was ninth in 
her Walk-Trot-Canter class after 
also winning first place at both 
Regional Finals and Zone Finals. 
Evans also rode solidly in Novice 
Over Fences (2-6 jumps) after 
winning her class at Regional 
Finals and placing second at Zone 
Finals. 

It was a whirlwind three days 
for all three riders, it being their

Fencing bids farewell to thtee seniors 
UCSD loses team captain and Athlete of the Year

Staff Writer 

The UCSD fencing team bids 
&rewell to its three veteran seniors 
this season: Halvor Melom, Lauren 
Muir and Kent Thompson. 

Melom, an epeeist, finished 
17th in the Intercollegiate Fencing 
Conference of Southern California 
this season, helping UCSD's men's 
epee team finish fourth as a team 
overall. According to head coach 
Stuart Lee, Melom was a walk-on 
to the team his freshman year with 
no prior fencing experience. He 
represented UCSD well that year 
and has evolved into a 50lid starter 
ever since. 

"Hal really developed into a 
leader through dogged detennina-
tion," Lee said. "He has good work 
habits and a sense of accountability 
and responsibility, which has 
helped him become a solid per-
former and stable influence on the 
team." 

This year, Melom was captain 
of the men's epee squad. He is fin-
ishing a double major in political 
science and communication, and 
next year he will attend law school 
at UCLA. 

Muir, also an epeeist, finished 
third individually in the conference 
this season, helping women's epee 
finish second overall. Muir made 
an appearance last season at the 
2003 NCAA Championships in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., placing 
24th in the nation in her event. 
This year, Muir placed second in 
Regionals, just missing out on 
another trip to the NCAA 
Championships. 

"I gave Lauren [Muir] the 
Athlete of the Year award this sea-

son," Lee said. "She is so talented, 
and got us wins whenever we need-
ed it thls season. She is really 
mature beyond her years. I wish I 
could ~~ one more year with her. 
HopetuUy, she'll continue fenc-
ing." 

Because she only fenced three 
years in her time at UCSD, Muir 
still has a year of collegiate eligibil-
ity, and may continue fencing next 
year at graduate school. 

Thompson, a sabreist, has been 

captlio of the entire squad the past 
two years. He was the elder states-
man on a men's sabre squad that 
dominated the IFCSC by finishing 
1-2-3 individually (Thompson 
took second himself) and easily 
placing first overalJ as a teaJ;D. 

According to Lee, Thompson is 
a proven winner, evidenced by the 
fact that every year Thompson has 
been on the team, men's sabre has
