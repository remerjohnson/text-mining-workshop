Berkeley housing officials 
are considering whether to 
designate one floor of a high-
ri e residence hall as a gay 
and bisexual "safe space." 
According to members of the 
Residence Hall Assembly, 
proponents of the plan are 
seeking to establish the 
special floor to provide gay 
and bisexual residents with a 
cultural enclave within the 
larger dorm community. Juan 
Lopez-Rios, the assistant 
director of the Residential 
Living Office, said his office 
is interested in the program 
but needs more time to 
evaluate campus support and 
outline implementation 
details. The theme floor 
would be established in fall 
of 1997 at the earliest. Other 
theme floors currently in 
residence halls at UC 
Berkeley include programs 
focused on the African-
American community, Asian/ 
Pacific Islanders, Latino 
cultures and the Italian-
American community.

Charter High School Debate Continues 
DISCUSSION: 
Committee finds 
proposal may be feasible 
ByC ..... Sch .... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Marshall Provost Cecil Lytle's 
proposed UCSD Charter High 
School moved one step closer to 
fruition Tuesday when the Char-
ter School Steering Committee 

produced a report finding the cre-
ation the charter high school on 
the UCSD campus to be poten-
tially feasible . 

The Charter School Steering 
Committee, consisting of Lytle 
and various representatiyes from 
UCSD staff and faculty , as well a 
the surrounding community, de-
livered the report to Interim Chan-
cellor Marjorie Caserio on Tues-
day. 

The report, which has not yet 
been made public by the chancel-
lor, deah with such is ues as the 
university's liability of having 
minors on its grounds ; the legally 
questionable issues of student in-
come as a decision factor for ad-
mission to the school ; where to 
house an interim school on cam-
pus; where to construct a perma-
nent facility ; and how to fund the 
school. 

Caserio must now review the 
charter school proposal given the 
findings of the feasibility study. 

While the proposal addressed 
feasibility, the benefits of estab-
lishing a charter school were still 
unclear to many who gathered 
Tuesday at an informal question-
and-answer session at the UCSD 
Faculty Club.

Sun God 
Planners Step 
Up Security 
MEASURES: With increased 
staff, police hope to prevent 
drug and alcohol abuse 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

Fearing that history might repeat itself, 
the A.S. and the UCSD Police Department 
made a joint deci ion to step up security at 
this year's annual Sun God Fe tival on May 
17, in order to curb drug and alcohol abuse 
and to counter reckless behavior prevalent 
in years past. 

During last year's Sun God Festival , po-
lice made 16 arrests in which drug and 
alcohol abuse played a part, as well as 72 
"contacts" - or student-officer confronta-
tions - that did not result in arrests, accord-
ing to UCSD Police Sergeant David Rose. 

According to A.S. Commissioner of Pro-
gramming Kathy Lee, the factors involved 
in the recent decision to increase the number 
of security personnel were the larger range 
of bands playing, the high number of people 
expected to attend the concert and the his-
tory of problems at the festival. 

"A byproduct of the Sun God Festival 
has been a large number of parties being 
held before and during the concert, resulting 
in a great deal of intoxicated participants 
disrupting the festivities and causing prob-
lems for security and campus police," Lee 
stated, in an open leiter to the campus com-
munity last week. 

"We hope students will party responsi-
bly and leave their alcohol behind before 
arriving at the concert," she added. 

Prompted by their concern for partici-
pants' safety, faculty managers, events per-
sonnel and police decided to add extra secu-
rity at this year' s event. 

"Our thrust is to make [the Sun God 
Festival] a fun, safe event," UCSD Police 
Sergeant Jeffrey Hutchison said. 

According to Hutchison, the usual num-
ber of police officers on duty is six, with one 
supervising officer. But every year, that 
number has been increasec1 durinl the festi-
val, due to • need for more manpower.

FESTIVAL: 
Security to stem 
'reckless behavior' 
Continued from .,... 1 

Hutchison said that during this 
year's festival, security will be in-
creased to eight regular officers and 
two supervising officers, along with 
an additional two or three Campus 
Protection Assistants (CPAs). Event 
organizers will also bring in outside 
help by hiring Staff Pro employees. 

Hutchison said theCPAs will man-
age perimeter security, the Staff Pro 
employees wiU be used for stage se-
curity and the police will handle law 
violations at the evening concert. 

Rose said that officers will be on 
the lookout for any signs of alcohol 
consumption, including vandalism, 
urinating in public and reckless be-
havior. 

Any students who are intoxicated 
or who refuse to be searched will not 
be admitted to the concert. 

"We really have little choice. We 
cannot just ignore someone who is 
drunk - they may hurt themselves or 
someone else," Rose said. 

Rose, who is in charge of Residen-
tial Security Officer (RSO) deploy-

menl, said RSOs will patrol the cam-
pus mlidence halls to impede use of 
alcohol and drugs. 

''The anitude in the past among 
some students is that during Sun 
God the rules are off," Rose said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

rity agencies involved with the festi-
val, Rose said that any minor arrested 
for possession of alcohol or drugs 
would face losing his driver's license 
for at 1east one year. 

Rose added that individuals 21 
"[However), "'We would Iov. " If

stated in her let-
ter to the cam-
pus community 
that the daytime 
festival would 
be relocated 
from the Sun 
God Lawn to Lhe

Rose said that 
anyone found to 
be drunk in public 
will probably be 
taken to Detoxand 
charged a trans-
port fee. He added 
that if the indi-

UCSD Police Sergeant vidual is refused 

partially because of "sound eOITk 
plaints" from Muir and Mandeville 
faculty and administrators. 

by Detox because 
of his behavior, he will be thrown in 
jail. 

"We would love it if we could go 
out on Sun God and not make one 
arrest, but that has not been the real-
ity," Rose said. "[Students need) to be 
responsible. There are consequences 
for [their) actions." 

Hutchison said he believes the 
move to the Library Walk will ease 
the job of policing the festival by 
centralizing all the events in one venue.

Critics of UC Laboratories 
Should Check Their Facts 

Last week, the Assembly Committee of the Academic Senate met 
to discuss the UC system's future involvement with several 
Department of Energy laboratories. This year, the UC regents must 
decide whether they will renew their contract with Lawrence 
Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National 
Laboratories. 

The UC' involvement with the laboratories has been questioned 
since the Manhattan Project began over 50 years ago. Some argue 
thalthe university should not "participate in weapons research" 
becausc to do so is inconsistent with the university'S mission - that 
is, to educate and to suppon research. Others, such as UCSO History 
Professor John Marino, argue that "the labs are not pan of the 
uni"versity' s identity." 

However, these arguments are unfounded and seem to be knee-
jerk reactions to the word "weapon." If the critics had done any 
research of their own, they would know that the designing, testing 
and development of weapons has been phased out at Los Alamos 
(the university's former main weapons lab) and other labs. The lab's 
emphasis now consists of studying the aging process of nuclear 
weapons and increasing the safety of the existing 3,000 warbeads, as 
the United States moves into the next centwy. 

Ironically, the very people who fear these "weapons" refuse to 
acknowledge the labs' importance in research that will ultimately 
protect us all. For example, by claiming thallhe labs do not fit into 
the "uitiversity's identity," Marino fails to account for the Hwnan 
Genome Project, the AIDS Life Cycle Project. and the HIV 
Sequence Analysis and Data Base Projcct- all ongoing efforts at 
LOs Alamos. Marino obviously overlooked the endless amount of 
positive resean:h carriod out in UC labs. It is unaccepl8ble to wony 
about "identities," considering that many discoveries upon which the 
UC's SlCllar rqMIlIlion is based have originalcd at these labs. 

UCSD Police Need to 
'Stretch' Their Resources 

The recent wave of car thefts and burglaries on campus has 
sparked some concern over parking safety at UCSO. Although the 
total number of auto crimes has dccreaed this ye8', it has actually 
increased at North Parking and at Warren College, and non-auto 
crirrles in the parking lots has increased as a whole. 

What do campus police plan to do about parting-lot crimes? 
Nothing more than whal they are already doing: sending out 
uniformed police officers and campus security offICers during the 
day, and security offtcers during the night. 

VCSO police have planned no stakeout, no new strategy,to 
combat this auto break-in spree. 1be reasoning behind this inaction is 
weak. According to UCSD Police Sergeant Bob Jones, the effort that 
officers would exert for a stakeout would "stretch us to our limits." 

So what do campus police suggest students do? To begin with, 
students are told to personally take preventive measures, such as 
installing a car alarm or using a steering-whcellocking device. 
However, campus police need to initiate preventive J'IlCIISUI'CS. not 
lecture students on the necessity of being careful. 

Several officers were seen J*kcd at intersections for lengthy 
periods of time, presumably waiting for someone to break a major 
law, like running a stop sign. A few officers were seen patrolling 
parking lOIS. Of /ICJune,lhis was only to IIIIer write out tickets for 
those parting there. How would sending officers to guard parking 
lots, rlIIhc:r th .. inttncctions, "stretch" limits? Campus police should 
right their priorities and place officers where crime is occurring. 

UCSO's Iota _ u ..... e for cars, and perhaps even more unsafe 
for people. During the 1994-95 school year, two In'CSlS for bancry 
were made in the lois, and one cae of MItery in a lot wu reported. 
And in 1995-96: two repor1I of bIncry, one assadt with a deadly 
weapon and one arrest for battery - all in parting lots on <:ampUS. 
Some of these cues included rape: and/or sexual assault. This doesn't 
even include crimes perpetraICd elsewhere on campus while police 
were ticketing someone for rolling tJvough a stop sign. 

The threat of assault or batlCry should given higher priority than 
traffic violations. The fact that many such incidents occur in plrking 
lots, ~ auto thefts and burglaries are conunon, is a telling sign 
that the lots are not getting the attention they need. Campus paing 
lots must be petroIled at all times, and mtn offlCCfS need to be 
assigned to those paarols. Safety might just require a "1IJ'etCh."

THE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES 
OF COLLEGE LIFE 

COMMENTARY: Who can explain why we remember all the material 
for our tests after we hand them in, or why smaller books cost the most?

While physicists around 
the world labor diligently to-
ward the Holy Grail of phys-
ics, known as the Grand Uni-
fied Theory - which prom-
ises to coalesce the four fun-
damental forces of the uni-
verse into a single equation 
- the average college stu-
dent is beset by forces far 
more bewildering than any-
thing a physicist can hope to 
fathom. 

And even 
though

Any public event that caters free food to attract 
college students suffers from this yet-unexplained 
phenomenon. Perhaps dormitory fare has become 
dramatically worse since I moved off campus and 
there are unmeasured quantum-mechanical effects 
that create localized, matter-annihilating wormholes 
around groups of hungry college students.

By all appearances, textbook writers - panicu-

books - subscribe to science-writer bylaws that 

amounts of government grants to re-
search worthless subjects like String 
Theory, little remains in the public 
coffers to find answers to the ques-
tions that plague the average college 
student. This includes questions like 
"How the hell did my VISA balance 
get that high?" "Why do girls say 
they like )nice guys' and end up with 
creeps?" "How does my roommate 
get away with sleeping all day and 
still get a 4.0?" "What happens if I 
use a condom past its expiration 
date?" and "If vegetarians eat veg-

scary-sounding titles. Chemistry is 
particularly good in this regard, with 
cool book titles like "Nonlinear De-

Lanthanide Series Elements" and 
others that make one feel mighty 
sman to be seen carrying around such 
books. (Of course, taking a midterm 
or two in such a course can quickly 
eradicate this euphoria.) Naturally, 
one of the primary objectives of the 
intimidating titles of such books is 
to frighten off the science light-
weights.

Yet while engineering and natu-
ral science writers adhere faithfully 
to the rule of creating intimidating 
textbook titles, math authors seem to 
be needlessly obsessed with under-
statement. The average engineering 
student. used to "Nonlinear Beta 
Decays" and "Fluid Dynamics," is 
wholly unprepared to decipher de-
ceptively understated books like "El-

of the task of recruiting and retaining new members

any of these people can tell you, the surest way to

around campus advertising "Free Food." But for all 
the horrible things one could say about on-campus 
dorm food, it remains unclear why if free food is

COMMENTARY: Beyond the contrived theories of price-gouging and corporations joining together at the 
expense of the consumer, it is the realities of the market which dictate the recent surge at the pump 

MEDIA GoUGES GAS-PRICE ISSUE 
By NatMn PIetila 
Senior Staff Writer 

The mainstream media's cov-
erage of the recent surge in gaso-
line prices has been, to put it 
mildly, shallow and irresponsible. 
This is not to say that there hasn't 
been a method to the journalists' 
madness. In fact, they have shown 
admirable initiative in getting out 
half of the story: Gas prices since 
mid-February bave risen. on aver-
age, an astonishing 12 percent. For 
some states, such as California, 
this translates into pushing - and, 
in some cases, breaking - the $2-
per-gallon barrier. 

Ordinary citizens, to say noth-
ing of our elected officials, are un-
derstandably concerned. "Those 
damn oil companies are milking us 
for all we' re worth!" they fume. 
"We have to do something about 
this or the oil companies are go-
ing to bankrupt our economy !" 

While the media has done a 

D 
s C' i 

U C{ 
C Y 

great job of reporting the public' s 
reaction 10 the price hike, it has 
failed to adequately cover the 
causes of the rise in gas prices. 
About these causes, television 
journalists - and those oh-so-tal-
ented souls at USA Today - are 
eager to take the opinion of the 
man on the street at face value: 
"It's those greedy oil companies." 

Considering that the media is 
dominated by dyed-in-the-wool 
liberal Democrats, it is not surpris-
ing thai most reponers accept this 
explanation without question . 
Naturally suspicious of capitalism, 
the media assumes that this is just 
another ploy by the oil companies 
to steal our money. 

After all, didn ' t we see these 
same unreasonable price hikes 
when Saddam Hussein invaded 
Kuwait? (We didn ' t; those price 
hikes were linked to great uncer-
tainty surrounding the Middle East 
oil supply.)

tions propagated by the media. 
Here is what you won' t hear on Ihe 
evening news about factors con-
tributing to gas price increases: 
Because the winter of 1996 was 
exceptionally long and harsh, 
more oil than usual was needed to 
keep millions of families warm in 
their homes and workers warm on 
the job. 

Also, in anticipation that the 
United Nations would allow Iraq 
to begin selling oil on the world 
market. oil companies sold off a 
bulk of their stock in expectations 
of a drop in oil prices, thus de-
creasing the supply of oil. Because 
Iraq has since been denied permis-
sion to sell oil. companies have 
inventory shortages. and the price 
of gas has ri sen. 

Moreover. Congress just re-
pealed the 55 mph peed limit. 
This. combined with America's 
newfound affinity for gas-guz-
zling, sport-utility vehicles, con-

tributes to an increased demand 
for gasoline. All these factors con-
tribute to the recent surge in gas 
prices. Remember, prices simply 
equate supply and demand. 

But you won't hear about any 
of this in the main~tream media. 
And you won ' t see a dispassion-
ate analysis of the economic issues 
involved in the recent behavior of 
gas prices. Incredibly, what you 
will see is extensive coverage of 
the political posturing of Bill 
Clinton and Bob Dole. 

Seeing an opportunity to capi -
talize on consumer angst over ris-
ing gasoline prices. Clinton leapt 
into action. Trying to act like he 
had a solution to the problem. the 
president first directed the secre· 
tary of energy to "look into" the 
recent price increases and report 
back in 90 days. Care to speculate 
what that report will look like? 

Second. he directed the Justice

would significantly help the work-
ing man. 

Assuming that the benefits of

Klein 

ing college textbooks the first time 
(and every time thereafter) is an 
exercise in jaW-dropping sticker-
shock. 

One wonders how textbooks 
are priced - whether there exists 
a rhyme or reason to the inexpli-
cably rlndom numbers that appear 
on the price-tags of textbooks. Af-
ter exhaustive empirical observa-
tion, it is my conclusion that texts 
are priced as follows : 

Price = constlnt K times the 
upper-division number of class, 
divided by the number of pages. 
Thus, prices of texts are directly 
related to your advancement 
through the major, and reflect your 
increlsing commitment to the 
field. 

The closer you are to gradua-
tion, the more inflexible are your 
book needs. Likewise, the higher 

the tax repeal make their way to 
Ihe consumer, an American who 
uses 12 gallons of gas per week 
will see his bottom line improved 
by roughly $30 per year. 

But there is good reason to be-
lieve that the tax repeal will not 
be fully passed along to consum-
ers. While the gas tax undoubtedly 
raises prices for consumers, it also 
cuts into the profi ts of the oil com-
panies. If repealed , the gas-tax 
windfall wi 11 benefit both the bot-
tom line of the oil companies and 
the pockets of consumers. This 
way, the consumer will actually 
save less than $30, and perhaps as 
lillie as $15. The exact amount is 
unclear. 

But what is clear is that the

you go. in your classes, the less the 
authors of college textbooks need 
to offer, and the more the prices 
are inversely related to the physi -
cal number of pages your book 
possesses. Look at your book-buy-
ing experience to verify this effect 
for yourself - the higher you go, 
the more expensive your books get 
and the fewer pages they hold be-
tween their covers. Unsolved mys-
tery no more. 

Thus, I finish with the plea for 
higher expenditures on research 
into the remaining unexplained 
collegiate phenomena we face. For 
if one of the greatest mysteries of 
college life - the textbook pric-
ing anomaly - can be explained 
by a dim-bulb conservative col-
umnist like me, imagine all the 
good that a federal research grant 
could accomplish. 

Clinton gas tax raises roughly $5 
billion a year for the government. 
This is not an insignificant amount 
when considered over seven years, 
the time span in which the Repub-
licans hope to balance' the budget. 
Gas taxes are a fair way of raising 
money for the government. Unlike 
the progressive and convoluted in-
come tax , this tax is easy to ad-
minister and does not rail dispro-
portionately on a small segment of 
Americans. 

Adjusted for inflation, gas 
prices today are lower than they 

~ere during the early 1980s. It's 
time for the media to stop the hype 
and for the politicians to stop pos-
turing over the issue of gas prices. 
Let the market work.

Shapiro's Visit Draws Fans, Critics 
QUEST: Shapiro tours 
with his new book 'The 
Search For Justice' 
ayM..,H'", . 
Staff Writer 

Robert Shapiro, a member of 
the defense team that represented 
0.1. Simpson in his double-mur-
der Iriallast year, visited the Price 
Center Bookstore last Monday to 
promote his new book The Search 
For Justice. 

Shapiro gave a 4O-minute lec-
ture concerning the Simpson trial. 
The trial served as the basis for his 
new book. co-written by Larkin 
Warren. 

Simpson, the former football 
player/actor accused of killing ex-
wife Nicole Brown and her friend 
Ronald Goldman, was found not 
guilty by a jury last October in a 
verdict that "racially polarized" 
the nation, Shapiro said. 

In addition to discussing race 
relations, Shapiro addressed sev-
eral issues which came into ques-
tion during Simpson' s trial, in-
cluding domestic violence and the 

role of the medii in the justice 
system . 

"It was not the trial of tbe cen-
tury," Shapiro Slid. "It was the 
media event of the century." 

Shapiro said he has frequently 
been asked how he felt about cam-
eras being allowed into the court-
room. 

"If you followed the trial, you 
noticed I sat on the edge of the 
council table," Shapiro said, jok-
ing that he avoided being filmed 
because of the bald spot on the 
back of his held. 

On a more serious note, Shapiro 
claimed that he was the only law-
yer involved with the case who 
kept his promise not to grant inter-
views during the trial. 

Shapiro said that med;ated jour-
nalism, in which commentltors in-
terpret events to pointedly lead the 
audience to certain conclusions, 
as well as the tabloid media's false 
reporting, may have prejudiced the 
public eye. 

"You have to separate what the 
jury saw, which was permissible 
as evidence, and what [the rest of 
us) saw," Shapiro said.

Members of the audience also 
commented on the prominent role 
of the media in the Simpson trial. 

" I think it's amazing how 
moved by the media Americans 
are," Revelle freshman Brian Neal 
said. "It's hard to criticize the me-
dia when people freely Witch it." 

Muir freshman Dan Paredes 
said that because the trial was tele-
vised, its impact reached far be-
yond American soil. 

"I was in New Zealand at the 
lime, and 1 can tell you that they 
were watching it, too," Paredes 
said. 

Approximately 100 people at-
tended the Price Center event. Au-
dience members who could nol 
find seating in the atrium of the 
bookstore's first floor crowded 
onto the stairwell and second-floor 
balcony to catch a glimpse of 
Shapiro. Still more people waited 
in a line that wound around the 
bookstore to have Shapiro sign 
their copies of The Search For 
Justice. 

Kris Wilcox of Irvine said she 
arrived at the bookstore three hours 
early. 

"Out of the whole defense team, 
[Shapiro) was the one I liked," 
Wilcox said. "He was the most 
sincere." 

Tanyshia Ridley , a second-
grader at a local elementary 
school, was one of the youngest 
people to have her book signed by 
Shapiro . Ridley said she' d 
watched the Simpson trial at home 
on television. 

Despite the strong showing by 
Shapiro ' s fans, alleastone member 
of the audience gave Shapiro an 
unfriendly reception as he walked 
to the podium to make his speech. 

"Who's hissing?" Shapiro 
chided, causing several audience 
members to laugh. "Come on, thaI's 
not a nice way to welcomc me."

According to Lytle, the char-

the committee was looking into 
the possibility of having senior 
students take some freshman -
level classes at UCSD in lieu of 
an Advanced Placement (AP) 
program. Lytle said the pres-
ence of high schoolers would 
not affect class availability for 
UCSD students because the 
charter school students would 
have their own sections. 

The -proposed charter high 
school would ini-

purpose of im-

Lytle said 
the funding of 
the school 
would come 

- Johanllll a.umprtner from state 

programs currently in place. 
"After hearing what [the 

committee members) had to say, 
I really think it 's feasible," War-
ren sophomore Johanna 
Baumgartner said . "They ' ve 
done a really good job of re-
searching and planning for a 
charter school." 

Lytle said that one of the main 
benefits of localing the high 
school at UCSO is access to the 
university 'S resources, including 
exposure to UCSD students who 
might assist the charter school 
students with thei r stud ies. 

Lytle said that UCSO stu-
dents might be able to receive 
academic credit for tu toring the 
charier high school students . 

The high school would be 
kept separate from UC D in its 
day -to-day operati ons and 
would be a closed campus. 

However, Provost Lytle said 

Warren sophomore monies, the 
UC system and 

public and private donations. 
The proposal slales that the 

charter school would receive 
funding from the state on a per-
pupil basis , like a public school. 
The charter schoo'! would al so 
benefit from money and equip-
ment donated by local busi -
nesses and philanthropists. In 
addition, the school would re-
ceive support from the UC Pre-
paratory Fund, which was cre-
ated by UC President Atkinson 
for use in outreach efforts of the 
eight undergraduate UC cam-
puses. 

Most people who attended the 
meeting expressed their support 
for Ihe proposed charter school. 

"It' s a very good idea," 
Marshall scnior Marlon O'Oyen 
said. " II will give certain students 
the opportunity to further their 
education by taking advantage of 
the resources others have."

CASTNER: 
Senior aims for title 
ContInued from ..... 12 
led the Tritons 10 the Division m 
NIIionaI Championships - a task he 
would repeat all four years - and 
received freshman All-American hon-
ors. 

By the end of the season, Castner 
had qualified to be a member of the 
Unilcd States junior national team -
comprised of the lOp young runners in 
the nation - which would compete at 
the World Cross Counuy Champion-
ships in Amorebieta, Spain. At the 
championships, Castner showed the 
Division I schools just what they 
missed out on, as he was the top 
American finisher in the race. 

On the track, Castner would con-
tinue to impress by racing for the 
national championships in the 5,000 
meters, another feat he would accom-
plish all four years. It was during his 
freshman year that the goal ofbecom-
ing 'an individual national champion 
began to take form. 

"[A national title) was always in 
my mind," Castner said. "I never real-
ized exactly what it would take. r 
knew I could do it, but I never realized 

the discipline level that was required 
10 win a IIIIIiona.I champiomhip." 

Durin, his junior yeaz II UCSD, 
Castner ch:ovenld exactly what it 
would take 10 IIIain his pl. The 
cl'OSS-aIUIIlIy season laid the pound-

work for his eventual success, as he 
captured the Western Regional title, 
and he had the highest UCSD finish 
ever with a fourth place at the cross-
country national championships. 

His goal of being a national cham-
pion. however, would only be reaI-

meters. Despite the pouring rain and 
windy conditions, Castner took con-
trol with about a mile remai'ning, rac-
ing to a national championship in 
14:54.28.

was a good, satisfying feeling." 

Expeclllions now weigh heavily 
on Castner' 5 shoulders, as he prejIares 
for his final national champiohship 
run. Naperville. m. wiD be the place 
where thosecxpcctations could be all 
but forgtltten. It wiD all corne down to 
the running. 

'"The past four years have been a 
time 10 1eam and grow." Castner said. 
" have a lot of goals which are unful-
filled in and out of running. I'd like to 
find my niche and take the few extra 
steps needed to continue to succeed." 

Looking past college, the furure is 
bright for Castner. He hopes 10 spend 
next year in Arkansas concentrating 
on his training with good friend, Ryan 
Wilson-aDivision I national champ. 
During the summer he will take part in 
a run across America to promote 
awareness of the homeless problem. 

The run will conclude at the Olym-
pic Stadium in Atlanta during the 
opening ceremonies of the Olympic 
Garnes. [f the future for Castner re-
sembles his time spent at UCSD, it 
may not be the Trilon star's only visit 
to Olympic competition. The thou-
sands of miles and hours of hard work

USA: UCSD 
takes seventh at the 
polo championships 
ContInued from ..... 12 
Payne and freshman Alice 
Huszcz playing outstanding 
polo." 

Payne made All-Tournament 
second team and carried the Tri-
ton offense with 12 goals, while 
goalie HuslCz did not buckle 
under the intense pressure, which 
allowed her team to stay close in 
several games. 

"We were really tired for mosl 
of the games; and generally the 
feeling was that when we were 
behind, we wouldn't be able to 
catch up," Payne said. "But we 
did o.k., and we showed that we 
could play at thai level." 

Huszcz echoed her 
teammate's sentiments. 

''There was nothing excep-
tional about our play, and we had 
a chance to win some of the 
games we lost," she said. "But 
we played as a unit, and the 
team' s encouragement really 
helped me stand up to the pres-
sure. "

MIKE STANGE 

Let Them Play; 
They'l1 Stay 

In the wake of last week' s 
Hood of colle~e undergraduates 
abandoning their academic 
careers for the lure of NBA 
millioos. I suggest that !he 
United States Olympic Commit-
tee ditch its current convention 
of sending the NBA's hottest 
players to the Olympic Games. 
Let the most talented players 
from the college ranks represent 
the USA instead. 

You see. the last semblance 
of an extra-curricular benefit for 
many amateur basketball players 
was stripped from them with !he 
coming of !he "Dream Team." 
The 1992 Dream Team was 
creMed in response to !he 
AmericIn amateur squad' 5 
faihR in their quest for golden 
dreams in 1988. 

But buying gold is not the 
poi", of the Olympics. The 
games are supposed to be 
competitive contests between 
amateurs. not professional. 40-
poi", assassinations. 

Passing the torch back to the 
youngslq's would allow the up-

for an inIIfCur inlemllional

Wake Forest's seven-fOOler. Tim 
Duncan, would fit nicely into a

t takes a little more to make a cham-
pion. 

This phrase could be considered a 
personal slogan for J.1. Castner. The 
UCSD track and cross-country star has 

all the necessary steps and has over-
come every conceivable obstacle to insure 
that his narne rings synonymous with just one 
word: champion. 

As a senior at Oak Park High School. a tiny 
school in Agoura, Calif.. Castner was over-
looked by lop Division I schools. He had pul 
together a strong high school career. but injuries 
and illnesses during his final year prevented a 
scholarship from becoming a reality . Willing to 
walk on and compete at whatever university he 
attended. Castner looked to be headed to UC 
Qerkeley - that is. before realizing he couldn't 
handle !he Northem California lifestyle for four 
years. One visit to La 10lla was enough to 
convince Castner that UCSD was the place for 
him. 

"[San Diego 1 was !he last choice. l had never 
even seen it," Castner said. "I carne down and 
visited and said. ·Wow. I could handle this ... • 

From that pOinl on. one of the most success-
ful athletic careers in Triton history took shape. 
When Castner began his stay at UCSD. so too 
did his coach of four years. Ted Van Andale. 
Together. the two began working on a fonnula 
to create a Triton distance-running powerhouse.

Tritons Finish, as Seeded, in Seventh 
SEASON'S END: The UCSD women's polo team ended its year at the USA Water Polo Championships 
ByC .... LH 
Staff Writer 

When UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper set the pre-season goal to be 
one of the top four women's water 
polo teams in the nation. he was not 
predicting something spectacular or 
improbable - as each of his teams 
since 1987 has finished that high in 
the standings. 

But this year. with numerous 
'schools offering water-polo schol-
arships for the fint time. the Tritons 
did not keep up and were soon play-

. ing at a level far below the top teams 
in the nation. 

However, as UCSD prepared for 
the USA Water Polo Nationals last 
weekend at UC Davis there was still 
a glimmer of hope for the seventh-
seeded Tritons to upset a few teams 
and finish in the top four - some-
thing Harper was intent on accom-
plishing. 

The action started on Friday 
against Michigan. with the Tritons 
takin, the contest convincingly. 11-
4. Later that day, UCSD faced off 
against long-time rival Slippery 
Rock (penn.). but the 
outcome was not nearly 
as favorable. The Tri-
tons traded goals dur-
ing most of the first half. 
but several key miscues 
toward the end of the 
fi rst stanza allowed 
Slippery Rock to amass 
an insunnountable lead, 
ultimately winning the contest. 16-
8. 

"The first half was really well 
played." Harper said. "But we 
missed some executions before the 
half where we could have scored. 
and they started pulling away." 

Despite the loss. UCSD's earlier 
win over Michigan allowed it to 

advance to the second round on Sat-
urday. ln the first game against even-
lUal second-place finisher Cal, the 
fint half was played evenly. But. 
despite trailing just 3-1 at the half. 

the Tritons were unable 
to score a goal thereaf-
ter and fell. 6-1. Fatigue 
was definitely on the 
minds of Harper and the 
players. and there was 
no rest for the weary. as 
UC Davis was up next 
on the schedule. 

Despite pUlling up a 
strong fight. the Tritons could not 
match Davis' intensity and aggres-
sive offense. dropping the contest. 
6-2. 

"The Davis game was huge be-
cause a win would mean a fifth-
place ,ame on Sunday. and we 
wanted to finish higher than the seed 
we carne under," Harper said. "Un-

fortunately. the tealll was really tired 
and lacking intensity. and we did 
not play ai,the level we were ex-
pected to," 

The loss relegated the Tritons to 
Sunday ' s seventh-place match 
against UC Santa Barbara. In that 
game. a reenergized Triton squad 
emerged. defeating UCSB. 8-6. 

With this tournament. the UCSD 
squad finished its long season ranked 
seventh in the nation. a commend-
able finish considering the'dramati-
cally improved competition in 
women's water polo. 

"Our tc!llm developed into an ex-
cellent defensive ~eam. but our 
Achilles' heel was our offense. We 
could not score· effectively inside. 
and thaI's what set us apart from the . 
rest of the field," Harper said. "In 
the tournament. our team played 
fairly well. with senior Jennifer

After releasing two critically acclaimed 
albums in 1995 (Scream, Dracula, Scmun.' 
and the vinyl-only Hot Charity), Rocket 
Prom the Crypt has had a heavy lOUr Sched-
ule. The band played a series of club dates 
around the country and recently opened 
some shows for Rancid (before Rocket 
sinacr-guitarisl Speedo was recently injured. 
and the band had to cancel its final dates). 

Although Rocket Prom the Crypt has a 
higher profile than jult about Illy oIher bind 
from San Diego, last ~me the group played 
locally wu on New Year', Eve at the 
Casbah, making its appearance at the Sun 
God Festival on Friday a highly anticiplled 
event. After the Sun God date, the band will 

tour Europe and. return to San Diego for the 
start of Ihe ''Warped Tour" in early July. 
During a recent interview, saxophonisl 
Apollo 9 spoke about RocItet's rising popu-
larity, the inclusion of horns on its recent 
albums and Rocket's influence on the local 
music scene. --

To some purists, the main-
stream success of punk bands like 
Rancid and Green Day has sig-
naled the end of the musical 
genre's capacity to exist on the 
cutting edge. But Buck-Q-Nine 
singer John Pebsworth has a dif-
ferent view. 

"I love both Green Day and 
Rancid, both before they were 
popular and after. I think their 
newest records are their best yet," 
Pebsworth said in an interview for 
the Jan. 11 issue of the Guardian. 
"I'm kind of on tI\e fence because 

I'm one of those old-school guys. 
Traditional punkers are all pissed 
off about their popularity. I don 't 
see anything wrong with it. It's the 
kind of music I've liked for a long 
time." 

Formed in 1992 through a series 
of ads run in 77tL Reader, Buck-O-
Nine has released three albums. Its 
latesl release, a rlve-song EP titled 
MUter in My Head, was put out last 
December on the San Diego-based 
Taang! Records label. A local band 
that has opened for punk bands like 
Face to Face and Agent Orange, 
Buck-D-Nine will headline tomor-

Pebsworth said he first became 

interested in ska when he was a 
teenager living in Los Angeles. 

"When [ was in the sixth grade, 
I had two older friends who liked 
bands like Madness and the 
Specials. That was the first type of 
music [ ever associated myself 
with. That whole thing died, and 
then [ got into punk rock," he said. 
"Ska started resurging a few years 
ago, and then when bands like the 
Mighty Mighty Bosstones took the 
original formula of ska and mixed 
it with punk or something differ-
ent, I started getting back into it."

Tomorrow night, Oakland hip-hop group Souls of 
Mischief will take the slage at UCSD's Sun God 
Fesli val. The group's debut in 1993 contai ned some 
instant classic jams, such as 'That 's When Ya LoSI" 'and 
"'93 ' til Inlinity," and il is credited with bringing back 
the "bauling" of free-verse performance to hip-hop. 

The Guardian spoke with Opio, a member of the 
Souls, who discussed the current state of the hip-hop 
nation and the style of his group. .

Opio: The Souls of Mischief were never about punch-

off the top of the head - spontaneous. Some people feel 
that a freestyle is just a rap where there's a lot of brag-
ging and boasting, and you just drop a lot of punchlines, 
like "I' m doper than heroin" or something. 

That's not where our focus was. Our focus was in the 
whole concept behind one verse .... It' s like one direct 
motion - not hella choppy. 

We do two styles of freestyle. Freestyling where we 
get back to the roots of hip-hop - where you do your 
bait Ie rap, competitive rap. And also, our real definition

4 SUN GOD SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian 

o 
•• 

The creation of the Sun God reRected the 
diverse nature of U~SD and its community 

When Niki de Saint Phalle was 
first commissioned to create an art 
piece for the Stuart Art Collection 
in 1982, she probably didn't realize 
her project would become a center-
piece of campus life at UCSD. At 
the time, the Sun God was but a 
glimmer in her eye, inspired by the 
diversity of UCSD. Nearly a 
decade-and-a-half later, her brain-
child is a landmark with its own 
festival. 

Because it was to be the first 
work commissioned for the collec-
tion, the Stuart Committee wanted a 
well-recognized artist who could 
gel the ambitious collection off the 
ground. As well , they looked for a 
piece with an internalional flavor, 
to avoid having the collection clas-
sified as being solely American . 

De Saint Phalle, a world -
renowned arlist who was well -
known for her collaboration on her 
fountain at the Centre Pompidou 

Plaza in Paris, was the perfect 
choice. 

While a number of her sculp-
tures could be viewed at American 
museums - including Chicago's 
Museum of Contemporary Art and 
the Smithsonian Institute -lJCSD 
was fortunate enough to get the Sun 
God, which was her first large out-
door piece in America. 

"When I came here to San 
Diego, I thought it was a marvelous 
place," De Saint Phalle said, in a 
recent recorded lecture. "I thought 
it was unique, not only because of 
it climate but because of the diver-
sity - because of the mountains, 
the sea and the Mexican culture 
which is right next door." 

De Saint Phalle, who was given 
the freedom to select any site on 
campus for the piece, spent days 
scouting for the right location. 

"I went away and digesled all of 
this," de Saint Phalle said. "And I 

came up with the idea of the Sun 
God." 

The 14-foot-taJl sculpture was 
built in France, where de Saint 
Phalle has lived for over 20 years. 

Shipped to La lolla in February 
1983, the bird-like creature was 
hoisted atop a 15-foot concrete arch 
by a large crane arm . The installa-
tion was made a public event so 
that the UCSO comm.unity could be 
a part of its historical inauguration. 

The Sun God was appropriately 
placed near Mandeville, where the' 
Art Department is based. The Sun 
God was set down facing westward 
toward the Muir campus, which is 
no accident. De Saint Phalle chose 
Ihe position because it allows the 
sun to set on the golden crown of 
the statue. 

As for the arch that it stands on, 
de Saint Phalle originally envi-
sioned il as repre enting a bird's

Hiatus Editor 

Among this year 's Sun God 
Festival headliners Rocket From 
the Crypt, Buck-o-Nine and Souls 
of Mischief, an afternoon lineup of 
four · unsigned local bands will per-
(orm in the Price Center Plaza. 

The daytime concert - which 
includes the Really Rollens, the 
Naked Jumpies, Pro Voice and the 
Little Jimmies - will expose the 
student bands to audiences of 5,000 
or more. 

"What we wanted to do with the 
daytime concen is give these local 
bands an opponunity to showcase

A lot of people don't do off-the-

group of students," A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming 
Kathy Lee said. 

The RNlIy Rott ... , a three-
member outfit of UC:SD students, 
describes its style as "aggressive, 
high-energy pop." Known until 
recently as just 'The Rollens," the 
band's second demo Set for release 
next week is entitled £X-Girlfriend 
Crossing. 

Last seen at UCSO's "Raging 
Rumpus," the Naked Jumpi_ 
are determined to "have a fun time" 
in their afternoon slol at Sun God. 

"Our band's whole style is kind 

structure, originality in concepts 
and also word choice. We say lot of 
words that people never even

'It would be cool if it was all 
credible MCs from the East who 
were tired of people from the East 
nol geuing their props, or people 
from the East saying, "I'm tired of 
these fools from the West who are 
always dissing the East'and talking 
about 'West Coast! West Coast!'" 

Really, iI's like a lot of band-
wagon hoppers, and as soon as you 

of hard 10 explain, but we're really · 
just Qut to celebrate life and get 
people dancing," guitarist Bill 
Shaddox said. 

Self-described a a "Latin-
blues-funk rock... or super-rock'.' 
type, the six-member band will 
also play Ihe Casbah on May 23, 
and has opened for Sun God head-
liner Buck-Q-Nine in the past. 

The little Jimmies are also 
classifiable as funk-rock, and per-
form regularly. around UCSD, as 
well as Velvet and the Casbah. 

Pro Voice is an a capella group, 
made up of students from liCSD 
and around San Diego. 

start yelling "West Coast," people 
are like, "Yeah! I got your back." 
Personally, that's hella cornball to 
me because I don't care where 
you're from. 

I was just talking to Maseo from 
De La Soul. He was like, ''This. 
stuff about the East and West, Coast 
is faulty." 

We don't look at each-other-like 
he's from the East or whatever. 
That shit is blown completely out 
of proportion - the way people 
wanna make it seem like now it's 
the time for it to come out. It's 
always been like thaI, and iI's never 
really gonna stop, It's like a high

always been about competition,

AN OPEN LETTER FROM 
THE SUN GOD CHAIR ••• 
An Important notice to tbe 

UCSD community: 

On Fridty, May 17, 1996, 
the annual Sun God Festival 
will be held at the Sun God 
Lawn and the Library Walk, 
and the evening concert will be 
at the Price Center. This year, 
·the Sun God Festival 
Committee and the ASUCSD is 
proud to present Rocket From 
the Crypt, Buck-O-Nine, Souls 
of Mischief, and the Invisible 
Scratch Pickles, featuring DJ 
Q-Bert. 

In previous years, the loca-
tion of the Daytime Festivat 
has been at the Sun God Lawn. 
Due to the sound complaints 
from last year's entertainers at 
the lawn, amplified sound was 
not permitted this year. The 
committee felt it was important 
to allow as much student par-
ticipation at the daytime festi-
val, and therefore decided to 
e.xpand the festival. 

Entertainment for ~he day-
time festival will be held at the 
Price Center,. starting at 11:00 
a.m. Food booths will be 
placed on the Library Walk, 
while the game and informa-
tion booths wi·1I be at the Sun 
God Lawn. 

In years past, the evening 
concert' has attracted ' close to 
5,000 UCSD students. Each 
Sun God Festival increases in 
magnitude and scale, and this 
ye~'s event w'ill be no excep-
tion. A byproduct of the Suh 
God Festival has been a large 
number of parties being held 
before and during the concert, 
Jesulting in a great deal of 

SALES 

intoxicated participants dis-
rupting the festivities and caus-
ing problems for security. and 
campus police. We hope stu-
dents will party responsibly 
and leave their alcohol behind 
before arriving at the concert. 

Please ,keep in mind this 
concert is open to UCSD stu-
dents with their ID card and 
their guests (18 & over) only. 
Prior to entering the concert 
venue, all individuals will be 
asked to show proper identifi-
cation and any visibly intoxi- ' 
cated individuals shall be 
denied entrance. In addition, 
the following items w.ill not be 
allowed at the venue: contain-
ers' of ,any kind, backpacks, 
food, beverages and any photo-
graphic or recording devices; 
purses will be subject to search 
for these items as well. As one 
of the most significant and 
longest-running traditions at 
UCSD (this is the 14th annual 
Sun God Festival), we ask stu-
dents to be tolerant of these pre-
cautionary measures, so that 
future Sun God Festivals will 
not be jeopardized: 

We at ,ASUCSD are aware 
these precautions may seem 
overly protective, but we also 
realize they are necessary in 
order to ensure the safety and 
well being of aU attendees. The 
ASUCSD wants to continue to 
program and not be restricted 
by the actions of a few reckless 
students , With- your help, we , 
hope this . year's Sun God 
Festival will be the most suc-
cessful yet.

BIRD: SUD God 
adds color to UCSD 
ContInued from pace 4 
nest. Bird-like figures are a recur-
ring theme in many of de Saint 
Phalle's other sculptures. 

"He was to be on a nest, and 
the base was to be covered with 
wild flowers, " De Saint Phalle 
said. 

However, being a sculptor and 
not a gardener, the foliage did not 
grow quite as she had planned, 
Nevertheless. at the time. the 
piece livened up an otherwise 
dull campus. 

"There is really no color on 
this campus. There are no flow-
ers. The architecture is mostly 
low-key," Stuart Collection direc-
tor Mary Beebe said back in 
1983. "It's nice to have some 
punctuation with art and extraor-
dinary color." 

The Sun God is at the other 
end of the artistic spectrum from 
Robert Irwin 's Two Running 
Violet V Forms, in the nearby 
Eucalyptus grove. While the 
Irwin's piece is rigid, de Saint 
Phalle 's sculpture is a gently 
sloped sculptural form. 

In the end, de Sai nt Phalle 
cited the campus and its sur-
rounding environment as being a 
primary inspiration for the Sun 
God , 

"[The Sun God], in II way, is a 
celebration not just of the immen-
sity and the beauty of the climate 
and landscape, but also of the cul-
tural identity of Mexican art and 
the Mexi can God, Quixicoto, who 
is a life-giving force and feath -
ered serpent," de Saint Phalle 
said.

CRYPT: Band

Continued from PICe 2 
The album was so amazi ng. I didn't 
hear a saxophone, but I wanted to 
go for it. I wils so poor that I lived 
off potatoes so I could 'afford a sax-
ophone.

Oh yeah. The band is always 
changing, and it gels better over the 
years. But sometimes I hear a song, 
and it's hard to find a niche. Horns 
I hear today are kind of cheesy -
most of them sound like Kenny G. 
Do you hnprovlle .. all w ..... 
you...., 11v.? 

No. The only improvisation 
comes from the number of beers l' ve 
had. We stay true to our records. If 
you listen to any live Otis Redding 
records, his are jUSl like the records. 
We have a pretty thick sound, and 
if [ do something different, that 
might fuck things up. I like to see 
bands that sound like they do on 
the record. Every show is different 
because the setting and sound is 
different.

Yeah. I think we' ll get rid of 
guitars all together on the next 
release. They're so boring. It's kind 
of cool the way it worked out. 
People weren 't into the horns at 
first, and the horns on Circa: Now! 
were so minimal. I'd like to see 
more horns on the coming record 
and different hom sounds, some- . 
times really brassy like on a 
Rolling Stones record, as opposed 
to horns on a Springsteen album.

parisons. He's got some great 
songs on Born 10 Run and before. 
It's sad, but once again he's an 
anist whose crappiest records are 
his best sellers.

SUN GOD SPECIAL II 

Earn a Master of Science in 
Nursing at Samuel Merritt 
College in Oaldand. 
Samuel Merritt College is now 
accepting applications for its 
new entry-level Master of 
Science in Nursing Program. The best influence we could 

have is just that we did it. We are 
not the greatest musicians, but I'm 
pretty happy and grateful for our 
success. We didn ' t have any money 
when we first went on tour five 
years ago. To thi day, that tour 
stands out in my life. It was the 
middle of winter, and we went out 
with no money. Once Japan hap-
pened, and we told people a bunch 
of lies about how we were like 
Metallica over there, people really 
took us seriously. I don't see us 
influencing any local bands musi-
cally, though. 

If you have a bachelor's 
degree and have completed the basic prerequi ite 
courses, you may qualify for admission to this 
exciting new program. Thirty·two student will be 
admitted and clas e tart in September. 

The curriculum emphasizes ca e management 
and offers excellent career preparation for today's 
dynamic managed health care environment.

12 SUN GOD SPECIAL 

IM'~ IN fUll )WING AT )UN GoD 
Traditionally, the Sun God Festival is UCSD's most 

popular event of the year - a chance for the campus to 
shed its scholarly demeanor in favor of a more lively 
collegiate atmosphere. UCSD students look forward to 
putting down their books and joining their friends in the 
mayhem of Friday night 's concert. 

However, in recent years, the Sun God Festival has 
come to represent something else - namely, intramur-
al sports. The festival marks the UCSD intramural (1M) 
depanment's most anticipated of weekends, one syn-
onymous with major athletic tournaments in some of 
the campus' most popular intramural sports. 

Each year, the tournaments have increased in scope 
as well as in numbers, and this year's version will be no 
different. Intense athletic competition will be offered in 
a variety of sports, making for the most ambitious Sun 
God ports endeavor in history. 

"We' re just trying to make the Sun God a bigger and 
better tournament involving a larger diversity of pe0-
ple," Intramural Sun God supervi or Anthony Ota said. 

Indeed, with a variety of athletic offerings - each 
with two different ski ll levels - there is something suit-
ed to all students, from the die-hard intercollegiate play-
ers to the just-wanna-have-fun rookies. 

"If you' re coming out to have fun, and you don't 
want to play the best intercollegiate players, there's 
intermediate [levels]," Ota said. 

This year the 1M depanment is expanding its offer-
ings in an allemptto auract new participants to the play-
ing fields. 

"Female participation in the past has dwindled," Ota 
said. 'That's why we're adding a coed, seven.on-scven 
soccer tournament." 

Fueled by an overwhelming resurgence during the 
wi~er season, the soccer tournament was added to the 
Sun God's typical offerings. At least 30 team are 
expected to compete, with the winning tearns in each 
division receiving Triton Sports Championship jerseys. 

Of course, the staple sports are also back, led by 
Saturday's five-on-five dunk basketball, which is tai-
lored specifically to 1 JCSD students. The rims at the 
Muir courts have be",,, lowered to nine feet, so every-
body ean be like Michael Jordan. In addition, the two-
point arc is a mere 18 feet away, so there is sure to be a 
lot of long bombing. Along with the open and intenne-
diate levels, a women's tournament will be offered in 
the afternoon. 

As usual, the day's highlight. the annual Sun God 
Slam Dunk Contest, will be held at around 12:30 p.m. 
at the Muir courts. Each basketball team is allowed to 
have one representative compete in the contest. 

Rounding out this year's Sun God spoitS menu will 
be coed floor hockey and four-man football, both regu-
lar Sun God offerings. 

Coed floor hockey will be played as a tournament 
format on Saturday, which aligns brackets for Sunday's 
elimination play. Men's f~man football will take 
place on Saturday. 

Of course, the Sun God tournaments would not be 
complete without prizes for the champions, and this 
year the 1M department has upped the ante by securing 
some heavy-hitting sponsors. 

In addition to the T-shirts going to the soccer 
champs, the ever-popular Pizza Port is awarding T-
shirts and gift certifJCaleS to the football winners, while 
Carlos Murphy's restaurant is presenting gift certificates 
to the basketball champions. Ptee refreshments will be 
served It all of the events. 

Sip-ups for the loUrnamenIs will be held through 
Friday II R1MAC's inb'anUal otIic:e.
