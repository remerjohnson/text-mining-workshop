Day Care Center Receives Funding But Not Enough 
Greg Moser 

The UCSD Day Care Center, in 
desperate need of funding, has received 
$3,780 from the Chancellor's contingency 
fund supplied by the Regents to provide 
urgently needed supplies for the next 
four months. These supplies include : an 
additional full-time teacher and two part-
time workers, money for more books and 
toys, a safe swingset, refrigerator, record 
player, television, and a tape recorder. 

national Center at 4:30. The decision of 
the administrators would be discussed. 

The need for funds is critical; at issue is 
the University's responsibility to provide 
adequate child care for its students and 
employees with pre-school children. 

needs. The desirable ratio of adults to 
children is one to five. When volunteers 
are absent, the ratio at the Center reaches 
one to ten. 

The request for state funds is in its final 
stages of preparation. It would enable th 
Center to expa nd to accommodate 80 to 
100 children, providing for 4 full-time 
teachers and an equal number of 
assistants, as well as two other staff 
members. A survey made by the Office of Student 

Affairs showed that at least 100 children of 
UCSD parents have need for the present 
Day Care Center. As the University grows, 
the need will increase. 

Be cause facilities, the most 
troublesome being space, are so limited, 
only 20 children ca n now attend . Twenty 
more are on the waiting list. Althol,lgh the 
Center is open to faculty and staff, most of 
the child ren attending are students', since 
student children are given priority. 

This expansion would require the 
Center to move from its tiny present 
quarters. To wh re? According to Univer-
sity architects, a new building would cost 
some $140 ,000 to build, and ad-
ministrators have already made it clear 
that no such sum is forthcoming for the 
indefinite future. 

But more important to the struggling 
Day Care Center is what the funding did 
not include. The most expensive needs -
maintenance and landscaping - were not 
provided for, neither was any promise 
made of support beyond the four months 
of operation covered. 

Many of those in the coalition who met 
said the S'Jrvey was too conservative 
because it asked who would use the 
existing inadequate facilities which re-
quire parents to pay $60 a month in 
addition to volunteering time, instead of 
inquiring into the need of free day care. 

In spi te of these facts, those who had 
talked to Vice Chancellor Bud Sisco said 
that he wanted assurance that there 
would be "a continuing need" for 
anything the University provided the 
Center. They, in turn, sked for assurance 
that the University would help support 
the Center after the four months which 
have been funded - until a proposal 
requesting state funds has been ap-
proved . No such assurance has yet been 
given. 

The alternatives seem to be either pre-
fab movable structur s, at an estimated 
cost of $15,000 or us of an existing Third 
College dormitory. Of the two, the use of 
a dormitory s ems more likely at present. 

After estimates for landscaping and 
maintenance have been submitted to the 
Administration, a rapid decision is ex-
pected. 

The group of some 20 concerned 
parents and others who met last week to 
discuss the new funds decided to hold an 
open meeting last Thursday at the Inter-

Plans for another survey to determine 
the need for a Day Care Center that 
would demand less of the parents are 
being made by the group. Director Josie 
Foulks said that at least two parents have 
already had to remove their children from 
the Center because they could not afford 
to pay. Others do not j.Jse the center 
because it barely meets the children's 

Except for an initial gift from the Stu-
dent Association for remodeling the 
building the Center uses, it has been 
supported entirely by parent's fees . 

The problem is that no state funds are 
expected for a year and the University'S 
grant is very temporary - only four 
months. Those who need the Day Care 
Center now are wondering what happens 
in between.

Affirmative Action 

Saltman Satisfied, 
UCSD Concerned 

Hannah Cohen 
Affirmative Action has been established on the 

UCSD campus to help UCSD comply with the HEW 
demands that there be more employment of women 
and members of minority groups by UCSD. The 
following is a portion of the statistical report showing 
new UCSD faculty appointments for the period of 
January 1, 1971 to December 31, 1972. 

These statistics reflect the efforts of Affirmative 
Action to recruit more women and minority group 
members to the UCSD faculty.

Dr. Paul Saltman, Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs was completely satisfied with the figures 
because he feels that " affirmative action was ex-
tended" because the "opportunity was extended" to 
more women and minority group members to apply for 
open faculty positions than ever before. He said that 
eligible people were contacted and that UCSD 
pUblished in national magazines to announce faculty 
openings. He feels that the increase of women from 
2.5% in 1971-1972 to 3.7% in 1972-1973 and minorities 
from 8.9% to 12.4% for the same time period in regular 
faculty positions was a direct result of Affirmative 
A tion's moves in this area. 

According to Jack Douglass, Assistant to the 
C.h~ ncellor, HEW stated "that this was the best year for 
hlnng both women and minority workers at UCSD." 
Mr. Douglas also pointed to the fact that minority 
p rsons applying for staff positions have increased 
from 14.6% in 1971 to 19.5% in 1972.

In contrast to the views held by Dr. Saltman, Jack

Program Board 
Needs Input 

Kathy Redding 
Why aren't there more student activities this year at 

UCSD? Who chose Murray Roman to open the 
Phlorescent Leech and Eddie concert? How are campus 
a~tivities planned and funded, and by whom? The 
Student Information Center on the ground floor of 
Urey Hall, where Dean of Student Activities and 
Manager of Arts and Lectures Diane Annala has her 
office, is the place to go for answers to these questions. 
Solutions to the problems they pose are not so easy to 
pinpoint. 

The official body for student activity planning at 
UCSD is the Program Board, a group of students, 
faculty, and staff from the three colleges who set 
policy, allocate funds, and carry out programming. 

Several small subcommittees, which will soon be 
consolidated into two - one responsib le for popular 
and special events, and the other in charge of musical 
and art productions - complete the actual business of 
planning. 

The Board 's budget com s from registration fees, the 
Regents' Opportunity Fund, and part of the $6.00 
voluntary student fee which resulted from last year's S 
referendum. Being the structured mechanism for 
providing student activities, the Board is the obviou 
target of attack from tho e who are dis atisfied with the 
number and / or quality of events on campus. It is 
criticized as inefficient and unresponsive to student 
needs. While many types of campu activities have 
flourished this year at UC D (i .e. bluegrass concerts, 
the art gallery, minority programs) the general level of 
low-key stud nt entertainment has declined. 

The Coffee Hut, aturday night movies, and other 
small-typ campus events have uff r d largely as a 
re ult of the Program Board 's allo ation of only $2500 
for their funding , as oppo ed to th $10,000 budg t 
with which the AS sponsor d u h ev nts last year.

La Jolla's Walk 
for Understanding 

SOFA, Strongly Oriented For Action, is holding its 
third annual walk on Saturday, March 3. The walk 
begins at SOFA, 7519 Cuvier St., anytime between 8 
a.m. and 11 a.m. The money raised in the walk will be 
used to help build a Community House to serve some 
of the needs of La Jolla's minority community. It would 
provide a day-care center for children of low-income 
working mothers, a study hall, and a library, counseling 
offices, a recreation center with a kitchen, a gathering 
place for teens, and a manse. Matching funds are 
available for every dollar raised in the walk. Walkers 
should contact people before the walk to sponsor them 
for each mile they walk. 

This year the walk will emphasize the need for 
understanding between the minority and majority 
communities of La Jolla . At the checkpoints of the ten 
mile walk along the coastal regions of La Jolla will be 
resources people who have in-depth knowledge of the 
problems of La Jolla's minority community and will be 
available to speak and answer questions. 

For more information and walker forms call Patsy 
Boggus, 453-8308. Sponsors to pay people walking for 
SOFA would also be appreciated. 

Cal Pirg Planning 
Meeting Today 

Due to the success of recent projects, Cal-Pirg is now 
busy planning more projects in the public interest. 

Last week Cal-Pirg released the results of its Retail 
Price comparison study to the press. The response has 
been very encouraging. Many consumers have con-
tacted Cal-Pirg members who worked on the project 
and thanked them for providing accurate information 
of grocery prices at different stores. 

Other projects, like the environmental study of lead 
distribution and the fraudulent auto mechanic cam-
paign are also well underway. 

Cal-Pirg is now in the midst of planning a new set of 
consumer projects. These projects may range from 
ecology concerns to sexual discrimination investiga-
tion, from false il dvertising to malnutrition studies. 

The scope of tl-e projects is virtually unlimited except 
for one comm(,n goal. Each Cal-Pirg project will 
involve students arid professionals working together in 
the public intertst, 

Faculty memb rs, ~raduate students, staff and un-
dergraduates art' all invited to attend the~t:: plonni"3 
meetings. Anyore who has an idea or would like to 
help out, or just learn more about Cal-Pirg is invited. 

The next Cal-Pirg meeting will be held today, 
February 27, in tre Muir Fishbowl (under the cafeteria). 
The meeting wil run from 4 to 5 p.m. 

Farmworkers 
Food Drive 

The United Farm Workers (UFW) requests the 
assistance of all concerned people, according to Mi-
quel Salas, Campus Representative of the group. 

"Local MECHAS and other Chicano groups are 
organizing a food drive to EI Centro on March 3, so any 
donations must be given by that time. 

" Striking Farmworkers in EI Centro need all of the 
basic foodstuffs that they can get - canned goods and 
powdered milk primarily," Salas said. 

Salas also told the TRITON TIMES that picketing of 
Safeway supermarkets in Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach 
and La Jolla continues on every weekend. 

Anyone interested in either donating food, 
volunteering services in driving the food to EI Centro 
or helping to picket a Safeway should contact the UFW 
at 453-9061 . 

Salas adds that Safeway patrons should boycott the 
market chain that sells non-union lettuce. 

Writing Workshop Has 
Spring Openings 

Literature/ English 10, the 2-credit writing workshop 
course, will have room in the spring for sophomores, 
juniors, and seniors. Basically everyone goes once a 
week to a 2-hour workshop, talks and writes. You can't 
miss workshop and there's a lot of pressure on you to 
produce. To sign up, enroll in one of the five sections. 

The following special-special-interest groups are set 
up for spring quarter. If you see Suzie Jacobs, 2D 2024, 
you can join one. Or you can get together with two 
other people and make your own group and set up 
your own sub-section. See Suzie about getting a tutor 
who would also be interested.

New Courses 

Ed Simons 

The Provost 's Office today announced that because 
of the recent passage of Proposition 19, new courses 
will be added to the curricula of Muir and Third 
Colleges. These courses are a result of student demand 
and are concerned with smoking grass and its attendant 
hassles. 

The new department will be under the precarious 
direction of Dr. Elihu Jehosephat Zappe. In the area of 
credentials, Dr. Zappe comes well endowed. He boasts 
three degrees from Harvard, two from MIT, and 
twenty-two degrees from the Horizontal (he is a 
hunchback) . On top of all this good stuff, he has 
numerous achievements in the field of practical 
research : two years in Chino, a brief stay in Lexington, 
and a 6-month hitch in Vietnam as an agricultural 
advisor. 

The new courses are meant to give direction to those 
students who are just now getting into dope. They will 
also be able to teach seasoned heads a thing or two 
they didn't know about dope. 

Before entering into one of these courses, the 
prospective student' will be given a profiCiency test at 
the Psych. Department offices. This test will consist 
(and this is confidential) of a series of photographs and 
several types of soft drinks. The testee will be asked to 
describe the correlation of the pictures and drinks. 

Those stating the task makes no sense will not be 
considered. Anyone who does not see a correlation 
will be accept d into Ihe pilof program. 

The new course titles appear below; each with a 
short description. \ 

·Advanced Dope-2C 3 units 
Will include carburetion dynamics; mixture ratios; 

history of dope; sex and/ or dope. 
·Intermediate Dope-2B 3 units 
Creative apathy; 1001 world crises that can be solved 

whil laying on a waterbed listening to Pink Floyd; why 
you can't really fly from Argo to Urey Hall. 

·Beginning Dope-2A 3 units 
Tricks that will amuse your fiends while stoned (52 

pick up, Grand Funk at full volume, etc.); tricks that will 
amuse you while stoned (what your name spells 
backwards, etc.); tricks that will amuse no one while 
stoned ("Hey, that was the Police Dept. Your parents 
committed double suicide and left a note blaming 
you," etc.). 

·What is Dope?-1A 1 unit 
Th'e meaning of life, death, and dope; I am Joe's vas 

deferens; an intimate touching session with male and 
female marijuana plants. 

In conjunction with the above courses, the depart-
ment will offer a series of seminars. Attendance is 
required for 2C, optional for others. The titles are listed 
below. 

Marijuana : Fun or Good, Clean Fun? 
How To Cultivate Dope 
How To Cure Dope; And What Makes It Sick In The 

First Place 
How To Win Friends And Leech Their Dope 
How To Keep Your Friends From Leeching Your 

Dope 
Confidential sources have told this writer (that's me) 

that these courses will be no breeze. With this in mind, 
it is good to know that a new set of notes (Zappe's 
Notes, $5) will be available at the bookstore. 

Conference for Creative Ignorance 
"Knowledge is not a copy of reality. 
To know an object, to know an 
event, is not simply to look at it and 
make a mental copy, or image, of it. 
To know an object is to act on it. To 
know is to modify, to transform the 
object and to understand the 
process of this transformation, and 
as a consequence to understand the 
way the object is constructed. An 
op ration is thus the essence of 
knowledge, it is an internalized ac-
tion which modifies the object of 
knowledge."

Dedicated to the underlying 
theme that education encompasses 
far more than that which occurs 
inside sterile classrooms, the con-
ference has been constructed so as 
to encourage individuals to actively 
create their learning. We encourage 
you to come and learn with us by

ference. You are also heartily en-
couraged to bring t-shirts, sheets, 
and other materials for tie-dying, 
musical instruments, combs, tin 
cans, sticks, your own creativeness 
and yourself. 

This conference is to be only the 
beginning of a series of spon-

Rod Rogers Dances at UCSD 
The Rod Rodgers Dance Company, a powerfully innovative black dance troupe 

from New York, will perform in the UCSD Gymnasium one night only, Friday, March 
2, at 8 p.m. 

Tickets for the performance are $3 for general admission, $2 for UCSD faculty and 
staff, and $1 for UCSD students, and are on sale at the Urey Hall Ticket Office on 
Revelle College and at the door the night of the performance. 

The nucleus of this exciting young company is made up of individuals who are 
choreographers and dance instructors in their own right. The group presents a 
variety of music and dance theater perspectives reflecting the different backgrounds 
and experiences of each of the performers but which combine to form a unique 
theater experience. 

While the group many times relies on the deep ethnic roots of Afro-Cuban dance 
and jazz, its work is also rich in modern and avant-garde styles including the new 
multimedia techniques. 

In the UCSD performance the troupe will present two dance dramas and a number 
of other short works from its repertoire._ "Harambee!" (which means "Forward with 
Unity" in Swahili) is a dance drama created by Rodgers depicting the inspiration, 
assassination, and spiritual resurrection of black leaders. 

Also to be performed is "Box," a dramatic dance study of malevolence in today's 
prisons inspired by and dedicated to George Jackson of Soledad and the men killed 
at Attica. 

Rodgers, choreographer, dancer, and director, was introduced to his art as a child 
in a family of professional dancers. Since coming to New York in 1963, he has 
performed with several concert companies; has worked in off-Broadway theater; 
and with his own company, has firmly established himself as one of today 's most 
provocative choreographers 

He has authored several articles on dance including "Men and the Dance : Why Do 
We Question the Image?" published in Dance Magazine in 1966, and "Don't Tell Me 
Who I Am" published in Negro Digest in 1%8. He is also an articulate spokesman for 
dance. 

r" 
In 1965-66 he received a John Hay Whitney Fellowship and was selected to receive 

a 1970-71 choreographer's grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 
Washington, D.C. 

The dance company has performed throughout the United States and is well 
known for its work with youth in community-oriented cultural arts programs. In 1970 
it performed workshops, lecture-demonstrat ions and master classes sponsored and 
coordinated by the Detroit, Michigan, Model Cities Program in cooperation with 
several other Michigan organizations. 

Ukiyo-e Prints 
An exhibition of Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints is being presented at the 

UCSD Art Gallery now through Saturday, March 24. 

It has also toured the New England states visiting many local colleges and toured 
the atlanta University Center campuses, Atlanta, Georgia, where the company 
received rave reviews from local newspapers. The company also received a 1970-71 
grant from the New York State Council on the Arts. 

The Japanese print is currently enjoying a revival of popularity after many years of 
neglect. In their time, the Ukiyo-e prints were meant to represent the fleeting world 
of intense pleasure, their subject matter being drawn from the beautiful women of 
the pleasure quarters and the great actors of the day. 

The Japanese prints exhibition attempts to illustrate the development of the 
Ukiyo-e print through representative works by its greatest masters, among them 
Utamaro, Hiroshige, and Hokusai. The prints on view at UCSD are on loan from the 
Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego and the private collections of Michael Todd and John 
Listopad .

Th Characters of Marbles 
DiUvid Buchbinder 

All the boys in the over-sized schoolyard loved 10 play 
marbles; although some could definitely play marbles better 
than others all of them (in the usual headstrong tempera-
ment of boys) claimed to be the best marble players in the 
school. There was am w ho always seemed to lose, but always 
talked himself into believing that he had won by "blessi ngs in 
di.sguise." Billy and Ton of Curd (who got his name by being 
the shakiest yet the most stable character o f the bunch) never 
seemed to lose. In fact, the both of them had a marked yen 
for turning defeat into victory. The aforementioned boys 
were always 'the first and major players in any game, but they 
all had their followers. 

Like followers of anything, these followers (who claimed to 
be friends of all the players, except for one, whose enmity is 
obvious) always waited to see how the game would conclude 
before ever deciding themselves to play. These followers are 
quite numerous, so I will mention but a few. First , there is a 
certain Louis Echh, a third-rate player, who will not join the 
game unless he is assured of vic;tory beforehand, or as Echh 
puts it, he at least likes his "parity to rema in the same." Then 
there is John (who used to be the schoolya rd bully). He is 
always so weighted down with pounds and pounds of 
marbles that he never seems to enter the game until after it is 
over. And fina ll y, there is Barry Ideo, who never p lays, but 
always claims victory by buying marbles from the others then 
staing that his are worth more. Furthermore, Barry is in a class 
of his own, with his own followers, who like Barry himself, 
are wholly dependent upon the whims of Sam, Billy and Ton 
of Curd, but never admit this dependency. 

Now that we are blessed with a brief account of the 
players, we can now observe more precisely how each of 
them approaches the ever-fluctuating game of marbles. 

Sam is always the first player in the yard at lunch time. But 
although he is always first, he has incessant fears about what 
the other players might do. He claims that they are always 
making up rules during the game which never let him win. 
For instance, one day Sam lost ten marbles for every hundred 
that he had, afterwards claiming that it was not his doing that 
had caused his loss, but the rules that the others had made to 
prevent his winning. Nevertheless, Sam still managed to 
claim victory . like all the other players (but maybe with more 
audacity than the others) Sam is never willing to admit the 
personal defects in his marble policy. 

While claiming stability, Sam's body sometimes appears to 
the others as if it were diseased with epilepsy. That is, he 
consistently swallows h is tongue (some claim to have even 
seem him swallow his foot at times); his hand never seems to 
know what to do, sometimes acting fiercely with much 
success while at other times receSSing itself disastrously 
(which it does quite frequently) . Sam's hand also has a known 
knack for twiddling itself to death. But Sam, endowed as he 
claims : " By God with more resources than any other damn 
player," almost always succeeds in hiding the symptoms of 
his disease, much to the consternation of the other players, 
and as said before, always claims defeat as victory by usage of 
his pet term "blessing in disguise." So much for Sam's 
inflated ego. 

As noted above, Bill y and Ton of Curd have a marked yen 
for turning defeat into victory. Perhaps this needs to bE' more 
explained. It seems that one day not so long ago Sam was the 
uncontested champion of not only marbles, but of tetherball, 
one man basketball and even jacks. However, the lack of 
competition in marbles (it has always been Sam's favorite 
sport) spurred Sam into marshaling his resources. That is, he 
gave Billy and Ton of Curd a lot of pointers about the 
intricacies of the game of marbles, proceedi ng to give them 
more marbles than they actually needed. Sam didn't realize 
that whereas Billy and Ton of Curd had nothing material , 
they had a lot of brains, and utilized these in conju nction 
with the aid that Sam had marshaled to them. (It should be 
noted that Sam thought that this help would protect his 
renowned audacity from Barry Ideo, who at the time was 
beginning to equal Sam's audacity, albeit in five day in-
crements.) However, Sam's plan backfired, and now even the 
most isolated observer can find little wrong with Billy's and 
Ton of Curd's agate abilities. They consistent ly maneuver 
Sam into embarraSSing losses, always gaining through the 
follower's further acceptance of their policies rather than 
those of Sam. 

To a certain exter>t, Billy and Ton of Cu rd have infiltrated 
Sam with all manne, and type of little bugs, which ~am ca lls 
" the rules that the others make without tel ling him." Of 
course, to Sam's inf ated ego, its all a "bleSSing in disguise", 

It's GOOD 
for your system, .. 

LA JOLLA MUSIC 
459-3375

although he has sometimes been recorded as claiming in the 
same sentence that Ton of Curd has even stopped so low as 
to actually steal some of Sam's steelies, proceeding to trade 
them to the followers for more marbles than Sam could have, 
adding insu lt to injury. It just may be that there is more fact 
than fiction in the claim that Sam suffers from chrooic, 
fluctuating fits of epilepsy, but it is an undisputed fact around 
the schoolyard that Bill y and Ton of Curd have out -marbled 
Sam for many days now. 

Never ceasing to follow in the wake of what seems best for 
them, the followers are always at the pot upon the moment 
of victory to claim victories without ever playing . The many 
Louis Echh's merely wait for the hand-outs, while the John's 
pretend to remain first rate players although their followers 
have long since removed John from the list of those to be 
followed. It would be fo lly to say more of these followers, but 
let it be known that the instin t of greed guides more than 
one of them. 

Claiming that he is no part of the " decadent marble 
players" , the self-proclaimed master of modesty (note that he 
is viewed by Sam as his equal in audacity), Barry Ideo, is 
perhaps the most audacious and avaricious of the entire lot. 
He is known to have claimed that he will bury everyone. 
Trading rather than playing seems to be Barry 's motto, He 
never trades during an official game though, as if he knows 
that there would be alluded a certain irony to his beliefs if he 
were seen by his followers (or anyone else for that matter) 
anywhere near the marble pot. So Barry trades secretly and 
then publicly and audaciously claims that he has all the 
marbles. This is apparently seen as very clever by many of the 
third rate followers. Rece ntl y, man y of them have begun to 
closely follow Barry, much to Sam's chagrin, because many of 
these followers recently followed him, that is until his 
epi lepsy and infla ted ego became too much for them. 
(Schoolyard legend has it, that at one time Sam - he is a fool 
- even lent Barry some marbles for a violent game he was 
having with Billy.) 

Barry Ideo does everything contrary to everyone elses 
rules, making up his own as he goes along. But although 
modestly claiming originality, the clever and audacious Barry 
will never admit his dependency upon the other players. 
Some of his wary followers, most notably Morey the Bum 
(who got h is name by fooling both Sam and Barry - but wbo 
very rarely plays marbles, mindingfor the most part , his own 
business), have pointed out that if Barry were to buy off 
everyone elses marbles, he would immediately become so 
weighted down with steelies, cats eyes and other agates, that 
he would either become exactly like the others, or rip his 
clothes apart at the sea ms, losing, as it were, all his marbles. 
Indeed, marbles at this point, dear reader, may seem to you a 
foolish game and you must be asking why should anyone 
play if gains are only apparently temporary, continually 
fluctuating according to the wh ims of foolery, avarice, 
epilepsy and audacity? 

The answer to the above question lies in the story of Ho-
Ho-Ho (the reason for his name will become obvious). Ho-
Ho-Ho, the tale goes, fought with Sam for many days, 
isolated in a little southeast corner of the schoolyard which 
was rarely ever watched by the other players (although when 
it was Sam would always lose a few more marbles) , One day 
after the fight had become boring to everyone else except 
for Ho-Ho-Ho and Sam (who themselves were even 
becoming bored and were talking about calling the whole 
thing off) Sam instituted a new rule ca lled the bombing rule . 
He could drop his marbles from th e air with precise aim whil 
Ho-Ho-Ho could not. Needless to say, this bit of audacity was 
much complained of by virtually everyone in the schoolyard, 
causing Sam to have a seizure whi ch lost him many marbles 
as a result. Shortl y thereafter, Ho-Ho-Ho and Sam ceased 
their game, each claiming victory. But the truth of the matter 
was that Sam (not remembering what had happened with 
Billy and Ton of Curd some days back), was going to give Ho-
Ho-Ho many marbles giving back those he had taken by use 
of the foo lish bombing rule and many more. Ho-Ho-Ho, a 
professed follower of Morey the Bum, would then too mind 
his own business. Ho-Ho-Ho even claimed that he had no 
intention in ever wanting to play marbles, since it was too 
risky and benefi ted no one if they kept playing. Furthermore, 
marbles ca n on ly corrupt those playing them. So Ho-Ho-Ho 
would gain and Sam would lose, proving once again the old 
maxim : " He who laughs last laughs best." 
Epilogue: 

11 was shortly after the end of his game with Ho-Ho-Ho, 
that Sam was forced to lose ten marbles for every hundred 
that he had. Naturally, Sam claimed this as a "blessing in 
disguise", but I think that this claim is only the result of 
another of his ever increasing attacks of epilepsy, which leads 
me to believe that he is certainly on the verge of losing, 
possibly forever, all of his marbles.

Laser Fusion : Now Y 
Recently the editor of a physics journal rec~ived 

article on the use of lasers in fusion research . The 
was sent to another researcher for review, part of 
was sent in to the journal with the comment that 
review proper was much longer but had to be edited 
much shorter article, because no security clearance 
been made on the other material. The author of the arti 
under review said that was not surprising and that 
comments left out probably dealt with omissions in 
article themselves due to clearance problems. 

When this paper heard of the incident, reporter 
Lipshut was sent to interview some of the people i 
and we report herewith our record of his first int."vi.,w 
it arrived in the mail. Possibly further accounts will 
forthcoming, and if so we shall attempt to relate them, b 
our communications have not been continuous and 
have no idea of Mr. Upshut's condition. 

Q : Why have security clearances become necessary 
the field of laser fusion? 

A : Well, first of all , 
, and we don't want the Russians to know about 

and then 

, which clearly is of vital importance to plans for 

, and so it's just not healthy to go arou 
shouting about it,

I have noti ce d your

I must compliment your

old worn out pla sti c

rusted mach ipe parts, dirty

my opinion the foutility of 
existential existence, the 
apathy of human co n -

virility of American society.

It even takes a ra rer form of

are just ahead of your time.

Coffee Hut: 
A Good Place 
To Visit 
Dear Tim, 

We at the Coffee Hut 
also dislike the rise in the 
price of coffee. But it was 
necessary to raise the price 
because of the need to 
break even. The Coffee 
Hut is suppo sedly AS 
owned and operated, in-
dependent of the other 
food establishments but 
due to the lack of business 
this is no longer the case. 
Sure, people remember 5¢ 
coffee and free refi lis at the 
Hut. W e also remember 
Wednesday night fl icks and 
entert ai nment on the 
weekends at the Hut. But 
since few know or care 
about th e Coffee Hut 
anymore, these things 
h ave gone by th e 
wayside. We all would like 
these things ba ck: but in

order to have them we 
need more people to use 
the Coffee Hut for their 
meals. This way we could 
have enough money to do 
some of the things that 
have made the Coffee HUI 
a good place to visit.

Nixon For 
Nobel 
Editor : 

To the slogan "I'm Glad I 
Voted For Nixon," I assert 
this to be outstanding! In 
addition, I propose "Nixon 
For Nobel," for this year's 
Nobel Peace Prize nomina-
tion . Certainly, it is obvious 
that the President has gone 
far beyond the call of duty 
for world peace. To those 
who would say no, I retort 
an affirmative yes! 

His trips to Peking and 
Moscow in February-May, 
1972 respectively, have 
produced a new direction 
for world peace . His 
agreements with both 
super powers insisted 
"peaceful coexistence" 
with mutual cooperation 
under negotiation for 
world security. 

It is appropriate to note 
President Nixon :

1M Basketball Holding Up Gym 

Crazy Saturday! 
Saturday March 3rd. will be full of diversified ac-

tivities beginning with the U.C.S.D. Rugby team 
fighting their way to victory on the intramural field 
from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Along with their keg celebration, 
the Recreational Events Club is sponsoring a Greasy 
Kid's Stuff Day. All three colleges should bring their 
strongest students to participate in the college tug-a-
war. The winners will receive the Chancellor's Trophy. 
The first five persons to sign up from each college can 
participate in a three-minute timed pie-eating contest, 
and the winner will receive a specially selected Sierra 
Club poster. Those brave enough to continue in the 
fun may try their luck at a three-legged potato sack 
race with record albums as gifts. All will love the 
conclusion to the day when all three colleges can have 
it out with a water balloon fight. The balloons are 
available in the P.E. Offices from Thursday afternoon 
on so that you may prepare ahead of time by fiiling 
your quota with water. 

All are invited to attend . the free dance in the gym 
that evening from 6-1 a.m. Any further questions may 
be answered by calling 453-2000 (X2262) . We welcome 
suggestions too!

Intramural basketball is 

many things to many 
people: to some, a chance 
for recreation and exer-
cise; to others, a com-
petitive atmosphere; to still 
others, a chance to be with 
friends and have some fun; 
but to intramural 
volley bailers, basketball is 
just one big pain. You see, 
with 1M basketball and 
various other activities 
dominating the court, 
volleyba llers get the shaft. 
Originally, they were given 
the staggering total of six-
and-one-half nights for the 
entire quarter to do their 
thing! But such grandiose 
amounts of time could sur-
ely not be given such a 
minor sport - and yes, one 
of the nights was 
eliminated! Fear not, sports 
fans, the replacement for 
that night is for the delight-

Season Finale Today 
If you have entered the 

confines of the pool 
recently, you are aware of a 
rather prestigious event 
today for a small but 
enthusiastic group of 
women on campus. Of 
course, those of you who 
have been at the pool, 
have seen the poster and 
realize immediately the 
topic of conversation. The 
rest of you u nfortu nates 
are not aware of the 
women's swim team going 
about their business today. 

To clarify . matters, 
UCSD's women's inter-
collegiate swim team is 
having a home meet today 
at 4 p.m. at the pool (where 

elseH So you didn't know 
there was a women's swim 
team? Well, there is and 
this is your last chance to 
see them in action (that is if 
you don't want to go up to 
UCLA and watch them 
swim). That's right, today is 
their last home perfor-
mance of the season, and 
they are going out in style. 
T oday's meet features such 
enlightening opposition as 
Cal State University at San 
Diego (with their own ver-
sion of Tarzan that you 
have to see to believe), 
Whittier College and 
Palomar Junior College. 

The UCSD team is 

loaded with a collection of 
stars you wouldn't believe. 
Take a glance at Elaine 
"Hammer" Simay, leading 
the team in the free-style 
events. If free-style isn't 
your bag, you can . check 
out Anne Curtis and Cheryl 
"Best to You" Kellogg. Of 
course, the rest of the team 
ain't gonna let you get 
bored. How could you with 
the likes of Valerie 
Cardeiro, Sue Adjemian,. 
Lois Boulgardies, Sue Mar-
tin, Dianne Klech, Julie 
Johnson, Sonya Nash, Terry 
Miller, and Teri Cullen. 

Don't forget , that's 4 
p.m. at the pool. 

Sparks to Fly in 
Final Home Game 

Thursday night brings the thrilling and 
chilling UCSD home basketball season 
to an end. The Tritons wind up a 
successful home season by taking on the 
Pasadena College basketball team. 

The Tritons losl a close game to the 
Pasadena team in a trip up north two 
weeks ago. The game was close all the 
way and the Tritons finally succumbed 
by a 7 point margin . This has made the 
team ready for bear this Thursday. The 
seniors are especially anxious for a fine 
game since this will be their last chance 

to impress the home cou rt fans . Excite-
ment should run quite high for the game 
as many of the team members are up for 
the game. Senior Jon LeLevier, that big, 
bruising guard for the Tritons, sums up 
the team's feelings when he says the 
Tritons are going to "smoke them right 
out of the gym." 

Be there to watch the sparks fly 
Thursday night in what should be a good 
game. The varsity game starts at 6 p .m., 
preceded by the ever-exciting JV team's 
performance at 6 p.m.

ful La Jolla Orchestra. Oh 
well! 

It's not l ike volleyball ad-
dicts are ready, willing, or 
anxious to play ( last 
Thursday Sue locked up 
the gym at 12:15 - that 's 
early ... the two previous 
Thursdays it was 1:00 and 
1: 1 5), it's just that if these 
fanatics have a chance to 
steal a court and throw up 
a net, they consider it a 
major victory. With both 
coed doubles and open 
sixes play this quarter, not 
only are there lots of peo-
ple who want to play, but 
the caliber of play is good 
and exciting. 

Doubles has been split 
into three team divisions 
of which the toughest is 
probably the King 
Alphonse Division. Elisiv 
Rogge and Bob Lawhead 
form an imposing duo, 
although they have played 
several tough matches, in-
cluding a squeaker over 
Dave and Soupie. The best 
team, however, may be in 
the Banana Grape Daquiri 

Division in the persons of 
Joan Roberts and Mark 
Schi lling. They cnnched 
their playoff spot by taking 
a hard fought game from 
Carol and (Don't Call Me 
Doctor) Jay, 11 -9. The th ird 
division is yet to be 
decided, as both Karen and 
Phil and (believe this or 
not) Doug and Cheryl have 
yet to be defeated. 

The open sixes leagues 
are just that - wide open. 
Any team in the league can 
give any other team fits on 
a given night. True, in the 
Drunken Sot League, One 
Too has yet to be beaten 
and T.T. again are still 
turkeying every match; 
nonetheless, last 
Thursday'S thriller won by 
hustling Hawaii Four-Two 
over All Spiked Out is an 
example of the type of play 
that has characterized the 
Drunken Sots. 

That screaming, excited 
group of vociferous 
volleyba llers in the Skip 'n 
Go Naked League have 
kept the gym rocking .

Screaming Yellow Zonkers, 
Scud, league- leading Bor-
borygmi and the rest have 
no qualms about voicing 
their enthusiasm and enjoy 
themselves as much or 
more than anyone in any 
sport. 

As the coed b-ball 
playoffs roll arou nd , so 
does the women's varsity 
basketball season. Alas, th is 
means that the supergirl 
jocks are no longer eligible 
for the joys of coed basket-
ball. It sure would show 
some good sportsmanship 
and all-around-nice-guy 
play if those teams that are 
making the playoffs on the 
strength of their varsity 
female stars would step 
asside for some deserving 
group of second-place 
finishers. Be cool, all right, 
folks?

been had was right! 

It turns out that Cravens 
had lunch with Mr. Allen, 
and through the chews of a 
hamburger, as Cravens put 
it, Allen told him that he 
was at UCSD scouting lo-
cations for his next picture. 
Acco rding to Cravens, 
Allen was impressed with 
the UCSD campus and told 
him that he was almost po-
sitive that this was the spot 
where he wanted his next 
film shot. 

Who knows, maybe even 
Howard Cose ll may be 
around to broadcast the 
shooting, but as of this mo-
ment nothing at all is defi-
nite. The TRITON TIMES

about the situation, so

Program Board ... 
Continued from pilge 1 

This so-called insufficient funding, as well as un· 
successful programming itself, characterizes the trial-
and-error learning encounteed by the Board in its 
struggle to organize itself and to plan events 
simultaneously. 

Among its lead successful enterprise has been 
Murray Roman 's act, a "dubious gift" according to Miss 
Annala, who secured his free performan ce when the 
band contracted for the opening act of the concert was 
unable to perform. Free and equally experimental, but 
much more successful, was Swedish singer Kasja 
Ohman, a performer in the Bluegrass concert. UCSD is 
limited in budget and facilities because it is a sma ll 
school, and its non-homogeneous student body rarely 
produces a large turn-out for any single type of event. 

Thus far the Board has employed various methods to 
obtain student input and to determine student needs: 
measure of an event's success by attendance and 
audience reaction: advice of student Board members : 
trends in book and record sa les: questionnaires dis-
tributed at campus events: surveys mailed to 50% of 
the student body : and suggestions from students acting 
on their own initiative. 
=:==~;;~;;=== The obstac les of inexperience and self-establishing i of the Program Board are being overcome with time,

"We (UCSD Women ) 
find the recent report on 
faculty hiring last year dis-
appointing. 

"The fact that UCSD has 
been successful in in-
creasing the proportion of 
minority faculty from 8.9% 
of the total to 12.4% this 
last year when the percen-
tage of doctorates awarded 
in 1970 to minorities was 
only 1% of the total, shows 
that aggressive recruiting 
can bring positive results . 

Since for the last several 
years at least, 13% of doc-
torates have gone to 
women, UCSD's perfor-
mance in raising the 
percentage of women 
faculty from last year's 
2.5% to a mere 3.7% this 
year hardly reflects an 
adequate effort. 

"Further, of the twenty-
two women hired, only 6 
received regular faculty ap-
pointments, 5 as Assistant 
Professor and 1 as 
Associate Professor . 
Women must be hired at 
all levels. The pool of 
qualified women is there; 
more recruitment effort 
must be made. 

"Contrary to often-
expressed fears that only 
women and blacks are 
being hired, it is interesting 
to note that fully 60% of all 
new regular faculty ap-
pointments last year went 
to Caucasian males."

AFTER TEN MONTHS OF RESEARCH 

We pieced together a system we could 
recommend under $200. The ROTEL 150A 
receiver with Its 2 yr. parts and labor warranty 
was found to deliver more power & better FM 
reception than all competition. Using Z-203 
(8 inch 2 way) speakers we weren't able to 
find anything that even came close to their 
smooth, natural sound. Finally the Garrard 
408 automatic turntable using the GRADO 
FCR cartridge gave us what we believe to be 
the best sounding combination .
