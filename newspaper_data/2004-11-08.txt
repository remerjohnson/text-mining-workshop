Union rally targets labor talks 
Church, campus groups back higher-wage bid 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Contributing Writer 

Protesting the low wages of 
service workers employed by the 
University of California, the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
staged its second rally of the year 
on Nov. 4 at Price Center. 

"We're spreading our word to 
whoever will listen," AFSCME 
executive board member and 
UCSD parking enforcement offi-
cer Irene Carrasco said. 

The protest coincided with two 
days of on-campus wage negotia-
tions between service workers and 
representatives from the universi-
ty. Similar negotiations are cur-
rently underway at every UC cam-
pus. 

The university has pointed to 
the state budget as the source of 
service worker dissatisfaction with 
wages. 

"We appreciate where [the 
service workers) are coming 
from, but with the current bud-
get crisis, [higher wages] are just 
not possible," UC Office of the 
President spokesperson Noel 
Van Nyhuis said. 

The university has said a new 
compact with Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, if approved by 
the state Legislature, will provide

for pay increases starting in 2005. 

Protesters gathered in Price 
Center before marching down 
Warren Mall to Voigt Drive, 
eventually reaching the Campus 
Services Complex, where negotia-
tions were taking place. 

Upon arrival, a number of ser-
vice workers and their supponers 
spoke to those at the negotiating 
table. 

"All religions are in favor of 
justice," said Sister Justine Church 
from the Interfaith Committee for 
Worker Justice, a group in support 

of AFSCME's cause. "When 
you're working as many hours as 
these [service workers) do, there's 
no room for God - and I don't 
think he's very happy about that." 

Church and her group were 
among several organizations that 
gathered in suppon of the protest, 
including the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees Union, College 
Democrats and Students for 
Economic Justice.

Campus bans raffles, 'games of chance' 
Rule blamed for change to annual Halloween tradition 

By PATRICK ALUN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Campus interpretations of 
California state law and 
University of California policy 
have outlawed "games of 
chance" on campus and resulted 
in the cancellation of the bingo-
like contest at John Muir 
College'S annual Halloween cel-
ebration. 

In spring 2004, Muir college 
officials learned from campus 
administrators that the University 

of California and UCSD regula-
tions have been updated to 
include the state's long-standing 
ban on gaming, applying it to 
prohibit any administrative unit 
or student organization from 
organizing lotteries that take 
place on campus. These games 
include aU activities in which an 
item of value, usually money, is 
exchanged for the chance to win 
another item of value, including 
raffles and bingo. 

"Gaming is unlawful [in 
California] unless expressly 

allowed, and use of the university 
must be in compliance with the 
law," Director of Student Policies 
and Judicial Affairs Nicholas S. 
Aguilar said. 

"Games of chance" are defined 
and expressly outlawed by the 
California Penal code. 

Most recently, the annual 
Muir Halloween Carnival can-
celed its planned bingo game, 
which has traditionally accompa-
nied its pumpkin drop. Muir

Pharmacy school awarded $30 million gift 
ByUSAMAK 

Associate News Editor 

The only pharmacy school in 
Southern California, UCSD 
School of Pharmacy and 
Pharmaceutical Sciences, received 
a $30 million gift from the Skaggs 
Institute for Research. The dona-
tion, announced on Nov. 4, is the 
largest ever to the campus division 
of health sciences and also one of 
the largest in the university's his-
tory. 

In recognition of the gift, the 
pharmacy school will be named 

after 1.S. "Sam" Skaggs, who is 
nationally recognized as a pioneer 
in the retail drug store industry. 
Skaggs established the Skaggs 
Institute for Research mainly to 
suppon medical research at the 
Scripps Research Institute. 

"In the years to come, this 
name will be synonymous with 
state-of-the-art education of phar-
macists and pharmaceutical scien-
tists, and also with research break-
throughs in fields like pharmaco-
genetics and bioinformatics," 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said 
during the announcement of the 

gift. 
The Skaggs contribution will 

provide $10 million in start-up 
costs along with a $20 million 
endowment to the school over a 
period of five years. 

The school, which currently 
enrolls 80 students, has developed 
a program that emphasizes 'bioin-
formatics, computational drug 
design and drug therapies tailored 
according to the unique genetic 
profilcs of patients.

Report: Black, Latino 
acceptance down sharply 

By ANGELA VAO 
Contributing Writer 

A repon published by a Latino-
focused think tank has criticized 
the University of California for 
declining percentages of accep-
tance for Latino and black students, 
citing concerns over the potential 
stratification of UC campuses 
along racial lines. 

The study from the Tomas 
Rivera Policy Institute found a sharp 
23-percent decline in aggregated 
acceptance rates of minority students 
over a nine-year period. The insti-
tute, affiliated with the University of 
Southern California, examined first-
time UC freshmen from 1995 to 
2003. Specificilly, the repon focused 
on the impact made by Proposition 
209, which eliminated the use of race 
and ethnicity in considerations for 
UC admissions. 

"All students have a harder time 
getting into the UCs, but the accep-
tance rates for black and Latino stu-
dents are abysmally low," institute 
President Harry Pachon said. 

Pachon attributed the gaps part-
ly to poorer schools - found in 
areas with a large number of under-
represented minorities - which 
have fewer resources, like Advanced 
Placement class offerings. 

"When you look at SAT and 
[GPAs of students from those 
areas], there's an unfair playing 

field," he said. 
The mainstream media reports 

increases in the raw number of 
black and Latino students admitted 
to UC campuses, but they actually 
make up a decreasing percentage of 
the overalJ freshman class, accord-
ing to Pachon. 

Using a system of aggregated 
campus acceptance rates, the insti-
tute calculated that the percent of 
Latino applicants accepted to UC 
campuses fell frOU\ 68 percent in 
1995 to 45 percent in 2003, while 
the number of black students admit-
ted dropped from 58 percent to 35 
percent in the arne interval of years. 
In the same time period, acceptance 
for white students fell from approx-
imately 67 percent to 52 percent. 

The aggregated acceptance rate 
is the total number of acceptances 
offered at each of the eight campus-
es divided by the total number of 
applications that were filed in each 
of the campuses. Data from 1995 
reflect the UC admission situation 
during affirmative action, compared 
to 2003, the second year the univer-
sity implemented "comprehensive 
review" for screening applicants. 

The repon attributed the steep 
decrease to the implementation of 
race-neutral policies. Voters banned 
the consideration of race in admis-
sion decisions at public institutions in

Organized peaceful1riof 

protests eledion 
A group of approximately 130 students 

and several staff members wore black and 
gathered for a peaceful meeting - advertised 
on posters as a "riot" - to discuss their dis-
satisfaction with the results of the 2004 pres-
idential election. 

In a small circle on Sun God lawn in front of 
the Faculty Club, participants took turns speak-
ing about their frustrations and anger about the 
re-election of President George W. Bush, Some 
students also spoke about the campus' history 
of activism in the 1960s and 1970s - when 
students blocked Interstate 5 - suggesting that 
the time was ripe for another mass shOWing. 

No one took credit for organizing the event.

students to take immediate action and 'get

raised their hands in support, 

co-ops, university begin 
mediated negotiations 

Student co-ops and university administra-
tors have entered into five-party talks with an 
independent mediator less than two weeks 
before the university-imposed deadline for a 
new lease agreement. 

Representatives from the co-ops, 
Associated Students, the Graduate Student 
Association, the University Centers Advisory 
Board and campus administration met for a full 
day of talks on Nov, 4 with campus 
ombudsperson Judith Bruner, All parties have 
agreed to continue negotiations leading up to 
Nov, 14, the date when the university has sug-
gested it may begin eviction proceedings if no 
deal is reached, 

All parties have signed a confidentiality 
agreement barring them from divulging details 
about the proceedings, 

However, Bruner said she remains 'very 
optimistic that the participants from the meet-
ing are working toward a common goal and will 
continue to reach consensus on the various 
issues related to the co-ops,' 

Though she could not comment on the 
;legotiations because of the confidentiality 
promise, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Canmen Vazquez said she felt very 'positive" 
and "optimistic' about a possible resolution. 

The willingness of all sides to sit down togeth-
er is a good sign, said A.S, President Jenn Pae, 

"~ says a lot' Pae said, "I hope that we con-
tinue these negotiations, and I think we will, I

NOTICE OF PUBUC SCOPING MEETING 
DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT 
UCSD EAST CAMPUS GRADUATE HOUSING 

The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) proposes to construct 
an approximately 374,OOO-gross square foot housing complex for single 
graduate and medical students. The project site encompasses 
approximately 8,2 acres and is located on the East Campus of UCSD 
immediately west of the existing Mesa Housing complex. The site is 
east of Interstate 5, north of La Jolla Village Drive, and will be accessed 
from Miramar Street. 
The East Campus Graduate Housing project will house approximately 
BOO students and six housing staff in 400 two-bedroom, one-bath 
unfurnished apartments and will provide approx imately 800 parking 
spaces (in parking structures) for the residents. The project is ex peeted 
to consist of low-rise (four story) and possibly some mid-rise (seven or 
fewer stories) structures, In addition to the residential units, the proposed 
development will include common spaces such as meeting rooms, lIending 
and mail areas, and leasing offices. 
On November 8,2004 a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact 
Report (EIR) will be publicly noticed and distributed. The project may result 
in significant environmental impacts, Based on the potential for impacts, 
UCSD is holding an EIR seoping meeting open to the public on:

Many tempers are flaring over the results of Tuesday's election. In such a divided 
time - when, as President George 
W. Bush put it, "You're either with 
us or against us" - many voters are 
directing wrath, ridicule or pure 
hatred toward those who voted for 
the other side. If Bush is still com-
mitted to the vision of "being a 
uniter, not a divider," he has a mon-
umental task ahead o! him. 

Everywhere young Americans 
turned prior to Nov. 2, we were told 
to "rock the vote." And roclc. it we 
did, albeit modestly. Turnout for 
under-30 voters increased to more 
than 20 million, a 9-percent 
increase over the year 2000, accord-
ing to the Associated Press. It's not 
the huge spike that P. Diddy and his 
ilk may have hoped for, but no sin-
gle election is going to fully erase a 
long tradition of apathy and disaf-
fection among young Americans. 

Nationwide, young voters sup-
ported Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) 
by a margin of 55 percent to 44 
percent - predictable, considering 
that young people have always been 
more liberal than their older coun-
terparts, and as a whole our gener-
ation has more liberal views on 
issues such as abortion and gay 
rights than our parents. 

But herein lies a potential prob-
lem: America's liberal youths both-
ered registering to vote, braved 
long lines at the polls, listened as 
media outlets such as MTV 
deemed the youth vote as pivotal in 
the election - and saw their candi-
date lose. The 82 percent of UC 
students who voted for Kerry are 

disillusioned, bitter, angry or 
dogged by the fc:eling that the rest 
of the country is ideologically 
opposed to them. After young vot-
ers rallied around the message that 
their voice counts, we're now fac-
ing the reality that our collective 
voice was drowned out. 

Bur we must not use that as an 
excuse to turn our baclc. on politics 
- in fact, we should do JUSt the 
opposite. Bush did emerge with a 
clear win, but for an incumbent 
president, his portion of the vote 
was unusually small. The political 
minority is sizable; in 1992, garner-
ing 48 percent of the vote was 
enough to give Bill Clinton the win. 
The country is split down the mid-
dle - encouraging news for those 
who may feel marginalized and 
aI ienated by the election results, but 
bad news in terms of actual progresS 
in the next four years and beyond. 

Former President Bill Clinton, 
in a speech to the Urban Land 
Institute on Nov. 5, articulated his 
message for young Kerry supporters 
and the Democratic Party as a 
whole: It's "a mistake for our party 
to sit around and ... whine about this 
and that or the other thing." We can 
whine abour the election results, just 
like the Democratic Party spent 
four years whining about Ralph 
Nader after the 2000 election, or we 
can further some real causes. Young 
Kerry supporters must realize that 
voting is only the first step in mak-
ing one's voice heard. 

Our next presidential election 
isn't for another four years, so for-
ward-thinking under-30s must get 
educated on the issues, connect 

with their like-minded compatri-
ots, write letters, demonstrate and 
otherwise raise hell . If you thought 
waiting in line to vote was tough, 
wait until you get a load of the leg-
work, the long hours and the many 
disappointments it takes to affect 
political change in more subtle 
ways - on the other hand, the 
blood, sweat and tears make success 
all the more sweet. This is the time 
for young Americans of all political 
views to back up our bark with 
some bite: We must show we really 

" It's a mistake far our party to sit around and 
... whine about this and 
that ar the other thing." 

- President Bill Ointon 
care, because in the whole scheme 
of things, voting is a very superfi-
cial way to get involved with poli-
tics. 

More importantly, the 
Democratic Party must evolve its 
tactics in response to the defeat. It 
must not budge on its core values -
the last thing we need is for the left 
wing to imitate the right more than 
it already has. Instead, Democratic 
politicians and pundits must change 
how they present themselves, and 
the party must change the way it 
articulates its message to voters and 
the way it responds to Republican

attacles. That includes disallowing 
Michael Moore to act as an unoffi-
cial spolc.esman for the party - no 
longer should he be allowed to mis-
represent the values and worldview 
of most Democrats, promoting flip-
pancy and bias instead of earnest 
discussion. 

Clinton has a similar tough-love 
message for the Democratic Party: 
"If we let people believe that our 
party doesn't believe in faith and 
family, doesn't believe in worlc. and 
freedom, that's our fault." Many 
people have a warped image of the 
parry, often based on what they 
know from right-wing pundits who 
the Democrats allow to promote 
damaging myths. Bush's re-election 
campaign was based on attacking 
Kerry, and Kerry never deflected 
the barbs effectively - he tried tak-
ing the moral high road, but instead 
just came off as a weak candidate. 
Democratic candidates, if they want 
to succeed, must grow some fangs, 
even if it means buying into the nas-
tiness that's come to characterize 
modern political campaigns. 

But beyond that, members of 
both parties indeed, all 
Americans - must learn to talk to 
each other effectively. The 
Internet, right-wing radio talk 
shows, booles by partisan authors 
like AI Franken and Ann Coulter, 
and other sources of "pop politics" 
are successful among consumers 
because they let people ignore the 
sid~ of the political spectrum they 
don't agree with. This needs to 
change. It's intellectually lazy, it 
promotes the ignorance and 
closed-minded ness that will deepen 

the rift threatening to tear America 
in two, and it kills any possibility of 
malc.ing politics work in this coun-
try. Demonizing, belittling and 
remaining ignorant of your enemy 
is not the way to defeat him. 

For Kerry supporters, this 
means talking to Bush supporters 
with respect and coming to under-
stand their motives. You may be 
surprised to learn that their motives 
for voting for Bush were exactly the 
same as your motives for voting for 
Kerry. Bush supponers must do the 
same and open up frank discussions 
with Kerry supporters. 

The great weakness of college 
students is that they're convinced 
they're right, and in classic Michael 
Moore and Bill O'Reilly style, they 
don't even entertain the opposite 
view. We must learn to do the 
dance of opening our minds and 
reaching out to the other side with-
out abandoning our core convic-
tions and values. . 

The deep divisions splitting our 
country are more obvious than 
ever, and they stand to worsen if 
the two sides of the political spec-
trum continue talking past each 
other instead of to one another, 
marginalizing and misunderstand-
ing each other rather than respect-
ing each other. Young voters are 
perhaps the best equipped to 
accomplish this taslc.: We are new to 
the political process, and we see its 
weaknesses and absurdities in sharp 
relief. Many of us are resigned to 
the fact that it's going to be a tough 
four years, but if the two sides don't 
reach out to each other, it's going to 
be that much tougher. 

Contributions should go to academic programs, not pools' 
By BENJAMIN BARTLm 

Staff Writer 

Over the last couple of years, 
UCSD has increasingly sought pri-
vate funds to sponsor what is a 
growing university in a time of 
budgetary cutbacks. For example, 
just recently it was announced that 
the Canyonview Pool would be 
expanded at a cost of $6.4 million, 
with funds coming principally from 
private (i.e. non-university) 
sources. Although many students 
remain enthusiastic about their 
future Olympic-sized facility, oth-
ers have raised concerns over the 

impact of the decision. Some stu-
dents (those who don't swim well) 
fear the loss of the shallow end of 
the pool, while others have ques-
tioned the role private money will 
have in what has traditionally been 
a publicly funded university. 

It is of course no mystery why 
some students fear the encroach-
ment of private funds at the univer-
sity. So many things (politics, 
sports, etc.) have already been cor-
rupted through corporate dona-
tion; thus we have SBC Park and 
the re-election of President George 
W. Bush. 

Afrer all, why would private 

business take an interest in UCSD? 
Even more mind-boggling, why 
would any corporation donate 
money to expand our pool? Is there 
going to be advertising along the 
tile floor, or perhaps a subtle 
change in the name? (I think Petco 
Pond sounds nice.) 

We can be pretty sure it isn't 
pure generosity (or what econo-
mists describe as communism) that 
is driving such contributions. We 
expect business to act in its own 
rational interest, to be philan-
thropic "hen doing so directly 
increases profit margins. 
Therefore, why would investments 

made at UCSD be any different? 
In this case, it seems that we 

may have reached some sort of eco-
nomic paradox. Canyon view Pool 
will not be renamed, and that 
advertisement "mural" has been 
stricken from the agenda. So OK, 
maybe these donations aren't just 
about the bling-bling, but the ques-
tion remains, why give money to 
UCSD? 

The answer to this apparent 
conundrum lies somewhere 
between greed and philanthropy: 
UCSD provides what economists 
call "positive externalities," or what 
political scientists desctibe as 

"good things that come out of 
something accidentally, and are 
free ." 

This is to say that our university 
provides a tremendous boost to the 
community, attracting students, 
business, innovation and invest-
ment, all of which come free to 
local businesses (unless you take 
taxes into account). Therefore, to a 
certain extent, what is good for the 
university is good for business. We 
are all in the same boat. 

Local businesses, of course, rec-
ognize this fact: That a better,

ETS, standardized tests control lives 
of students long after high school 

Numerous testing fees create huge revenues 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

I thought that after being accepted to UCSD, I would never have to face a standard-
ized test again. Multiple choice, 
essay, short answer, anything else 
- bring it on. Just keep me away 
from quantitative comparisons 
and analogies, please. After tak-
ing the SAT I three times, the 
SAT II seven times, and five 
Advanced Placement tests, I was 
done with number-two pencils. 
Can't all college students identi-
fy? 

But it was not over. The 
Graduate Record Examination is 
around the corner. Those phone 
book-sized Kaplan prep books are 
again sitting o~ my shelf. Most of 
the time, I'm okay with it. It is 
just another necessary step on the 
road to further my education, and 
I can't do anything about it. 
Other times, especially when I 
have just spent 38-odd minutes 
on a geometry problem I haven't 
encountered since 10th grade, I 
curse the maker of the standard-
ized test. I shake a clenched fist in 
the air, scornuig the invisible tor-
turer of student souls: "Fie, fie! 
Your foul invention is ruining my 
life!" 

The object of my much-dra-
matized laments is otherwise 
known as Educational Testing 

Service. Senior year of high 
school, I read an off-the-cuff 
alternative SAT prep book, which 
was, in retrospect, Ic.ind of a waste 
of money (sample chapter: "How 
to Fill in Your Scantron Sheet"). 
The introductory chapter, how-
ever, was pretty mobilizing in its 
call to arms against the Evil 
Testing Serpent. ETS, it 
explained, was a so-called non-
proS t organization that sucked 
up students' money to pave its 
solid-gold tennis courts at its cor-

" Basically, almost every 
student in the United 
States must go through 
ETS in arder to achieve 

his ar her gools, With that 
in mind, I wondered why 

ITS does not receive

porate headquarters in 
Princeton, N.). We had to · beat 
ETS at its oWn game by maneu-
vering through its manipulative 
SAT in order to attain college 
bliss. As ludicrous as that sounds, 
it was very effective in motivating 
me to study for the test. 

In reality, ETS is more like an 
800-pound gorilla than like a 
snake. For one thing, it produces 

and administers the SAT, the AP 
tests, the GRE and the Test of 
English as a Foreign Language 
(TOEFL), as well as the 
California S.T.A.R. tests and a 
dozen or so other exams. We're 
usually more familiar with the 
College Board, another nonprof-
it organization, which actually 
contracts ETS for its SAT tests. 
Additionally, ETS used to own 
the Graduate Management 
Admission Test (GMAT), but 
recently lost it to another com-
pany. Basically, almost every stu-
dent in the United States must 
go through ETS in order to 
achieve his or her goals. With 
that in mind, I wondered why 
ETS does not receive more 
scrutiny, from students at least. 

For example, does anyone 
know that ETS is anticipated to 
malc.e about $900 million in rev-
enue in 2004, according to an 
April 2004 Business Week article? 
That's not surprising, considering 
that they charge $82 per AP test 
and $112 for each GRE. Starting 
in January, SATs will cost 541.25, 
up from $29.50, not to mention 
another $10 to get scores by 
phone. No wonder ETS is malc.ing 
so much money! 

Rumors swirl around the uses 
of the profit made by the not-
for-profit ETS. The organiza-
tion sits on a 300-acre site and 
employs some 2,700 people, 
from education researchers to 
number crunchers. According to 
a 2001 report by educational 
testing watchdog Fair Test, the

OPINION 5 

R I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
We must re-evaluate 
meanings of words 

Editor: 
In the late 1970s when I was at 

the University ofIowa, I participat-
ed in several "Take Back the Night" 
marches. Many were incensed that 
would-be attackers were "stealing" 
the nighttime streets from women. 

I propose that it's time to "take 
back the words." After hearing so 
many times that President George 
W. Bush won because people with 
values voted for him, I have become 
very angry. I have values, and I voted 
for my values. And I die! not vote for 
Bush. The problem is that the Right 
has stolen the word "values." 

As a matter of fact, I think the 
Srst step to taking back our country 
should be for us to open up a 
nationwide/worldwide discussion of 
the meaning of certain words and 
phrases. At the very least, we need 
to stand up and lay our own claim 
to these words. I'd like to see a dis-
cussion of "values," "freedom," 
"strength," "special interests" (why 
isn't religion a special interest?), 
"conflict resolution," "morality," 
and most notably, "pro-life." 

Here's an example of what I 
mean. I realized that those who say 
they are "pro-life" are really "pro-
human-cell." I am pro-life. I support 
contraception, the right to choose 
abortion and programs for the poor 
because I value life. I value the life 
and quality oflife of women; I do not 
want to see their goals for education, 
careers, happiness and marriage 
being shattered by unwanted chil-
dren. I value the life and quality of 
life of children who are born to those 
parents who either didn't want them 
or don't have the emotional or finan-
cial resouices to raise them. I am 
pro-life because I am concerned

about the problems of overpopula-
tion. 

I am pro-life because I think a 
worldwide conversation is long over-
due about the ethics of killing 
upwards of 10,000 innocent civilians 
of another culture in order to hypo-
thetically prevent an unknown num-
ber of possible losses of our own. I 
am pro-life because I do not believe 
that we have the right to ex.ecute 
criminals. I think that "might" does 
not give us the "right" to cause pain 
and death to sentient creatures, ani-
mal and human alike. I am pro-life 
because I think the environment is a 
living thing itself and- should be one 
of our biggest ongoing priorities.

Depressed? We don't have to wait

Think about your own personal

Column: Standardized test .. 
ing group has lock on market 

continued from page 5 
last ETS CEO made $500,000 a 
year. It's a hefty sum for an orga-
nization that's supposedly non-
profit. 

ETS started in 1947 when a 
group of educational councils ' got 
together to plot how to screw over 
students and make money in the 
process, Well , seriously, the 
group's goal was to construct "a 
single organization devoted to 
research and assessment that 
could significantly contribute to 
the advancement of education .. . 
[and] these founding principles 
guide ETS today," according to its 
history, That's a surprisingly hon-
est goal - the objective to 
become an academic monopoly is 
actually written down, and "the 
advancement of education" does-
n't suggest concern for students so 
much as elitist ambition, Its vision 
details an intention " .. . to be rec-
ognized as the global leader in 
advancing quality and equity in 
learning every step of the way." 
True, ETS says it seeks to advance 
learning, but don't let the selfless 
language fool you, ETS is like a 
lot of other businesses -- it sur-
vives by selling products to cus-
tomers. 

Today, ETS earns 70 percent of 
its revenue from the mandatory' 
tests by holding what is basically a 
monopoly (it gets an "A" for stick-
ing to its initial principles!), at least 
in the college-testing realm. Its 
tests have a huge, billion-dollar 
industry ~ prep books, prep 
courses, tutoring. And recently, it 
has also tempered controversy wi th 
the revamp of the SAT, in light of 

accusations that it was not a fair 
assessment. 

That seems to be a fair accusa-
tion, considering that most of us 
never saw a quantitative compari-
son or six-syllable word before we 
took our first practice SAT What 
puzzled me was that the SAT is a 
test that measures test-taking abil-
ity, Sure, basic skills are required 
in order to understand the test. 
But a-s any savvy college counselor 
can tell you, the key to the SAT 
(and GRE, arguably) is a thorough 
understanding of the form of the 
test and elimination techniques 
rather than any real academic 
skills. Not to mention the racial 
and socioeconomic inequities that 
were argued to be reproduced by 
their tests. Thus, it was probably 
for the better that the SAT was 
reconsidered. 

ETS will continue to have con-
siderable influence in shaping our 
undergraduate and graduate 
careers. The group has enormous, 
and I'd say underrated, power in 
the world of education. And I sup-
pose there is nothing else I can do 
about it except forever loathe 
those darned three-letter 
acronyms: GRE, SAT, ETS, 

Study hard and talce the GRE 
as few times as possible. You'll 
save yourself some trouble and a 
lot of money. Donate the money 
you don't spend on testing to a 
charity, I say. There are some 
nonprofits-out there that actually 
need it,

Pool: Donations should be

continued from page 4 
more competitive UCSD makes 
for a more attractive and competi-
tive community, The grants and 
scholarships dedicated to the uni-
versity are an indirect invesnnent, 
helping the university turn out the 
managers, engineers and 
researchers of the future, while get-
ting a nice tax deduction to boot. 

However, there lies an inherent 
danger in private and public invest-
ment, and a ten-

used for programs that provide the 
most diffuse benefits to the greatest 
number of students. These are 
quite often the smaller, covert pro-
jects, like cheaper booles or better 
professors. Larger, more overt pro-
jects often benefit only a few. 

Considering the $6,4 million 
dedicated to renovate the pool, one 
must think, how many students 
does this actually benefit? Could 
more students have benefited had 

the money been 
dedicated else-
where? ' 

dency toward glitz 
and glamour. 
Investors are often 
tempted by large 
and oven projects, 
as they arc direct in 
their conception 
and easily visi ble to 
the public. 

For example, it 
is easy for philan-

out a building that 
bears a plaque with 
their name, hang a 
picture of their 
generosity in an 
office lobby, or

May of 2000, the 
university began

fundraising cam-

ofraising $1 billion 
dollars in private 
funds. Likewise, 
the university has

en a multimillion 
dollar campaign to 
fund the construc-

helped build the university pool." 

It is much harder to frame a 15-
percent discount on school text-
booles, and it doesn't sound quite as 
impressive to say, "Thanlcs to our 
organization, more professors have 
the opportunity to specialize in 
either teaching or research, 
depending on their skills and inter-
ests." 

There is a propensity for donors 
to suppan the big ' and obvious, 
while ignoring the more subtle and 
complex. Although this is not nec-
essarily a bad thing - in some cases 
it is the big project that most needs 
funding - this often leads to an 
inefficient allocation of resources. 

Money, both public and private, 
is efficiently allocated when used to 
increase the grea test overall utili ty 
possible. Thus donations should be 

tion of a new 
University House. 

Considering the sharp increase 
in private donations, it's important 
that we keep in mind what the 
most efficient allocation of these 
rerources would be. Granted, 
donations often come with strings 
attached, Le. the organization 
making the donation gets to 
choose where the money will be 
allocated. It is, of course, unlikely 
that the university will tell people 
where they can and where they 
cannot donate their money. After 
all, who turns down free money? 

However, for a project as 
grandiose as Ulmagine What's 
Next," I dream of a group of busi-
ness leaden that donates money 
not where it looles best .. . but 
where it would make the biggest 
difference.

Skaggs: Gift among largest in UCSD history Games: Groups have changed 
contests to meet state law continued from page I 

Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical 
Sciences has been to establish a 
program on par with the very best 
in the country, with an emphasis on 
pharmacy practice of the fumre," 
said Edward W. Holmes, vice 
chancellor for health sciences and 
dean of the School of Medicine. 

The Skaggs School is one of 
only two public pharmacy schools 
in the state. The other is located at 
UC San Francisco. 

Fox placed emphasis on the 
advantages of the school's location 
in San Diego. 

"The impetus for our new 
school of pharmacy at UCSD 
came largely from the San Diego 
community," Fox said. "Our part-
neTS in the regional biotech indus-
try believe that UCSD was 
uniquely situated to launch a new 
kind of pharmacy school, one that 
would focus on the 21 st century." 

Claildia Skaggs Luttrel, presi-
dent of the Skaggs Institute and 
Skaggs' daughter, said that sup-
porting the pharmacy school was 
natural for her family, which is 
dedicated to the fumre of medi-
cine and its impact on health care 
patients. 

"The commitment of Sam 
Skaggs to the business of pharmacy 
has always been more fundamental 
than the distribution of pharma-
ceutical and health care needs," 
Luttrel said. "My father has [been), 
and always will be, committed to 
patient-oriented care." 

A charter class of 25 students 
entered the pharmacy school in 
September 2002. By 2008, when it 
is scheduled to reach full capaci ty, 
the school will have 240 Pharm.D . 
students, 60 Ph.D. students and 
30 residents. 

"I knew that I needed an edu-
cation that would prepare me for 

community pharmacy [and) clini-
cal pharmacy, as well as research," 
said Lisa Mueller, a charter class 
student who also spoke at the gift 
announcement. "With the endless 
supply of experts in all of these 
areas, I found UCSD more than 
capable of preparing me for each 
of these career options. " 

Mter announcing the gift from 
the Skaggs Institute, administra-
tors, supporters and medical stu-
dents signed their names on the 

last steel beam that will complete 
the 104,OOO-square-foot, state-of-
the-art facility for the new school. 

The Skaggs gift contributes to 
the $ 1 billion fundraising goal for 
the "Imagine What's Next" capital 
campaign of the university. The 
campaign, scheduled to conclude 
in] une 2007, has raised $656 mil-
lion to date.

College Dean of Student Affairs 
Patricia Mahaffey said that the 
carnival- organized by the Muir 
Cullege Council - decided to 
forgo the activity, in which stu-
dents received a chance to win 
money and other prizes, because 
of the campus policy. 

Many organizations on cam-
pus have participated in games of 
chance or similar "opportunity 
drawings" in order to raise funds. 
According to Aguilar, several of 
the colleges on campus have run 
into trouble with hosting casino 
nights. 

In addition, the Muir's Resident 
Council fund raises in the spring 
quarter every year by raffling off 
the first time slot for the upcoming 
room selection. 

These activities have not com-
pletely been lost, Aguilar said. 
Many of the organizations have 
modified their activities to remain 
compliant with the state law and 
UCSD policy by providing par-
ticipants a chance to compete 
without necessarily making con-
tributions. 

At Muir, for example, the coun-
cil gives away students' first raffle 
tickets, offering all interested indi-
viduals a chance to participate. 
Those interested in increasing 
their chance of winning purchase 
additional tickets, an arrangement 
that meets the legal requirements, 
Aguilar said. 

"Raffles [such as Muir's Room 
Raffle) are permitted because 
anyone who wants a ticket can 
get one ... . Nothing of value is 
exchanged for participation in 
the game of chance," Aguilar 
said. 

Mahaffey explained that Muir 

has also been allowed to continue 
its Casino Night and Suitcase 
Dance, where one person anend-
ing is randomly awarded a trip, 
because there is no fee for partici-
pation. 

In addition to official adminis-
trative units, the policy applies to 
all students and student organiza-
tions. UCSD's Student Conduct 
Regulations states that any use of 
UCSD property must adhere to 
the appropriate federal, state and 
UCSD regulations regardless of 
the type of group using the prop-
erty. 

Student organizations are sub-
ject to the same rules and exemp-
tions as units of the administra-
tion. 

"Many organizations distri bute 
raffle tickets to distribute gratu-
itous gifts in order to increase 
attendance. If this is the case, they 
should be conducting them in such 
a way that it is in compliance with 
the law," Aguilar said. 

In addition, organizations can 
apply for a city permit in order to 
be able to host bingo events. 

While defined as a game of 
chance, bingo is permitted by 
California in designated bingo 
halls. 

Campus organizations, there-
fore, would have to apply for a 
permit from the city of San 
Diego before hosting such 
games. 

"UCSD is not subject to the 
city of San Diego, but to follow 
the spirit of the law, UCSD 
requires organizations to get a San 
Diego permit to host bingo," 
Aguilar said.

conriTwed from page I 
"These workers are the founda-

tion of this institution, and it~ only 
with them that we can assure that 
we're preserving a better tomor-
row," said Nina Leshan, leadership 
and development coordinator for 
UPTE. 

Occupations such ·as custodian, 
food service worker and 
groundskeeper are classified as ser-
viceworbn. 

In addition to higher wages, 
AFSCME has several other objec-
tives in mind for the benefit of 
univenity-employed service work-
en, the union stated in a press 
release. 

"Worken are asking for respect, 
a £air raise, an end to favoritism, 
seniority pay and a chance to 
advance via a career ladder pro-
gram," AFSCME protest organi~r 
Jessica Lepez said. 

Discontent stems from the fact 
that the university has offered no 
raises for the next three years, a 
subject brought up frequendy at 
the negotiating table. 

"Many of us are holding onto 

these jobs for the health benefits, 
but 0 percent for three years 
means zero hope for hundreds of 
workers," said Allen Rutherford, a 
senior building maintenance 
worker. 

The univenity responded to the 
protests with understanding, 
expressing anticipation for better 
budget conditions. 

"We're very hopeful that the 
compact with Gov. 
Schwarzenegger will allow us to 
offer them what they want," Van 
Nyhuis said. 

Service workers are among the 
lowest paid staff on campus, earn-
ing as little as $8'}2 an hour. The 
average university general staff 
member receives $10 per hour. 

"It's such a simple thing," said 
Jamie Browning, a program assis-
tant for the John Muir College 
Residential Life Office. "They're 
asking for only SO cents to a dollar 
more [an hourI - to give it to them 
should be obvious."

Co-op conflicts with university 
have long, complicated history 

By ALE55ANDIA RADICAn 
Staff Writer 

T hroughout the years, genera-tions of UCSO students have seen conflicts between the 
co-ops and the university come and 
go. This year, yet another point of 
disagreement has surfaced, whereby 
the university has threatened to evict 
th e four co-ops - Groundwork 
Books, the· General Store Co-op, 
Che Cafe and the Food Co-op - if 
favorable lease agreements are not 
made. 

The first co-ops were established 
on campus during the 1970s. 
Groundwork Books had been oper-
ating off campus in Solana Beach 
seUing textbooks to students, and the 
vice chancellor of student affairs at 
the time felt it would be "wrong" for 
students not to have their own text-
book store on campus, according to 
former president of the Graduate 
Student Association and 1996 graclu-
ate Steven Dubb. 

"There was a lot of conflict on 
campus in the '70s," said Scott 
Kessler, a former Student Center 
Board member and founding mem-
bcr of both the Food Co-op and Che 
Cafe. "[The] gLneral issues were stu -
dent democracy. ... [The co-ops] 
didn't meet any resistance." 

There were, however, several 
incidents in the 1980s that led 'to 
hostile relations between the co-ops 
and the university. In 1984, during 
the construction of Price Center, 
Assistant Vice Chance llor for 
Student Programs and Facilities 
10 m Tucker told Groundwork 
Books to end the sa Ie of textbooks, 
thremening to close it down if it did 
not comply. 

According to Dubb, the question 
of the Price Center, and specifica lly 
the question of allowing commercial 
establishments (such as Wendy's or 
Round Table Pizza), was very press-
i ng during this timc. 

The late 1980s and early 1990s 
also saw struggles over the types of 

locks used on co-op doors. In June 
1989, the university tried to add a 
provision to the co-ops' lease 
renewals, mandating that the co-ops 
have university locks on the doors. 
The locks and leases disagreement 
went back and forth, with the co-ops 
finally winning the battle and avoid-
ing university locks. . 

Late 1991 and early 1992 were 
arguably the times of the most con-
troversial co-op events. In 
November 1991, University Center 
director Jim Carruthers informed 
Groundwork Books that it had 30 
days to choose whether to become a 
conunercial vendor or become con-
trolled by the university. The reason 
for this threat was a misunderstand-
ing between the bookstore and the 
university concerning accounting 
practices and alleged viola tions of 
the Policy and Procedures Manual. 

Groundwork Books chose nei-
ther option, and as a result, power to 
the store was shut off. Negotiations 
evennlally failed. On Jan . 15 , 1992, 
at I :30 a.m., co-op members learned 
that UCSO police had broken .into 
the General Store in order to seize 
the building. 

"The nurpo e of our entry ... was 
to access the records [of the General 
Store)," Tucker said at the time. 
"We feared they were being doc-
tored. " 

\Vllen co-op members arrived at 
the scene, they found that the locks 
had been changed by the university. 
Students broke the new locks and 
had the store up and running at 7:30 
a.m. that morning. At 10:00 a.m., 
Tucker arrived at the store and told 
studen ts and co-op staff that the 
Gencral Store would be closed for 
an audir. 

As dle police and university offi-
cia ls went inside, students outside 
began to pound on the windows and 
chant, protesting dlt: fact that they 
were being locked out of the store. 
At 11 :15 a.m., students broke glass 
panels to gain entry to thc store and 
occupied it until nighttime. 

The occupation of the General 
Store ended on Jan. 16 when the co-
ops asked for and were awarded a 
restraining order against the univer-
sity and a Superior Court told the 
co-ops to give financial records to 
the university. 

Problems between the co-ops 
and the university arose in the sum-
mer of 2000 as well, when the uni-
versity objected to the shows being 
performed at the CM Cafe. 

"The university claimed that there 
were liability issues with the way the 
shows were being done," fonner GSA 
President of Academic Aff.Urs and co-
op staff member Kris Bohling said. 

Bohling said that when there 
were problems, the co-op workers 
fixed them quickly. 

On June 29, the co-ops received 
an e-mail from Assistant Director of 
Student Acti,,;tes and Government 
Randon E. Woodward telling them 
that the Che Cafe would be closed 
by the university. Unable to find 
legal counsel because of the timing 
of the e-mail, co-op members and 
students occupied the CM Cafe to 
prevent the shut-down. 

Eventually, a restra ining order 
was filed against the university and 
the Che was not closed down. 
According to Bohling there was 
clear support from students. 

"[1t was] pretty obvious that dle 
students wanted the Che to sti ll be 
there," Bohling said. 

In 2002 , controversy sprang up 
once again over a co-op-run Web 
site hosting "links to sites ... that 
were ques tionably terrorist," 
Bohling said . 

Burn.ucscLedu was a Che Cafe 
Web site which used the UCSD 
Internet domain and whose goal was 
to inform readers through primary 
sources about various political orga-
nizations. The site included links to 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia and the Kurdistan 
Worker's Party. Both organizations

Author tells of crazy worldwide travels in 'Bird Man' 
By ELLEN McDOUGALL 

Contributing Writer 

Before plunging into the depths of Eric Hansen's "The Bird Man and the Lap 
Dancer," a surreal and zany 
adventure, be prepared to fully 
suspend any sense of incredulity, 
not to mention any animal-loving 
instincts. 

This is especially difficult after 
the somewhat tri te and pre-
dictable Arlette and Madame 
Peruche - two very sweet old 
ladies who feed pigeons and cats 
- touch off a slightly weak but 
sufficiently random opening to an 
otherwise quite unbelievable read. 

Hansen, it seems, is not really 
concerned with our sense of real-
ity, or even attempting to trans-
port his reader into this other 
world; instead he departs from 
Southern France without warning 
to the wilds in the South Pacific. 
Here we are confronted almost 
immediately with images of him 

sailing about with hammerhead 
sharks hanging from his rigging, 
and blood and guts a-plenty. 
Nice. 

Perhaps this sudden leap was 
intentional; his reference to 
"French Doors" in the first para-
graph of the section entitled "Life 
at the Grand Hotel" lulls us into a 
fecling of being on the French 

. Riviera, about to enjoy a day of 
baguettes, cheese and wine. 
Hansen forces us to question 
these assumptions and suggests 
that there is potential for a com-
pletely different, uninhibited way 
of life. This certainly provides a 
refreshingly lighthearted perspec-
tive on life; the community in 
"Night Fishing in Nahimah" for 
example, accepts sexual relations 
with amusing honesty; shy boys 
are confronted with the address 
"Don't you have a penis?" and 
religious abstinence and differ-
ence is dismissed. "Muslim? 
Christian? Buddha people? All the 
same," Hansen writes. "We were 

young people. It is nature!" 
It is the style of these stories 

that prevents them being anything 
more than wonderfully colorful 
and exciting - though perhaps 
this is enough. There is a lot to 
enjoy despite Hansen 's simplistic 
and unimaginative prose, which 
can often leave the reader feeling 
somewhat alienated; does he real-
ly expect us to accept without 
question images of drunken South 
Sea Islanders flinging themselves 
off pool tables, throwing bowling 
balls at sinks and generally 
indulging themselves in untold 
hedonism without any kind of 
introduction or warning? There is 
barely time to consider as we are 
taken on adventure after adven-
ture; by the next page he is sand-
wiched between a forest fire and 
the sharlc-infested shallows of the 
Torres Strait. 

Despite this there are some 
real moments of inspiration. We 
see the protagonist tom between 
his desire to stay and forget the 

Western ideals of success, and his 
fear that it is a momentary joy and 
will fade, leaving only regret and 
disappointment. He seems 
painfuUy aware that he is unable 
to fully forget his past and fully 
engage with these places. 
H;owever, he does not end leaving 
us feeling that escapism is ulti-
mately impossiblel but instead 
learns to value these experiences 
for themselves and for the color 
they add to his life. These stories 
are not so much about finding 
one's inner spiritual self in a hut in 
the jungle, and leaving the 
Western world behind forever, 
but, more simply and less preten-
tiously, about finding one's self in 
a hut in the jungle, and baving a 
very silly adventure for its own 
sake. 

Hansen's characterization is 
often truly-enlightening. The por-
trayal of Madame Zoya is really 
beautiful; by this point I had real-

The Sex

Lillian Nedwick 

W here is it? Where is the big "O"? The sparks and fireworks, the screaming, 
steamy finale of a passionate cou-

pling~ I'm sure this question is 
being asked by all too many 
womep who wander the coital 
world, and I'm sure men are ask-
ing the same of their unsatisfied 
girlfriends. At least, I hope they 
are. 

In my quest to answer this, I 
will also attempt to clarify several 
myths surrounding the female 
orgasm. First, I challenge all the 
women of the world to promise to 
help themselves and their partners 
by always remembering to never, 
ever fake it. Ever. Nobody wins in 
that situation. Long-term lovers 
won't learn to please their girl-
friends, one-night stands get too 
confident, and the woman won't 
ever be satisfied. 

Trust me, it's worth the embar-
rassment to just tell the truth (and 
sometimes worth seeing the one-
night standee's shocked and 
alarmed face during the realization 
that he, the one and only superpe-
nis, didn't make his lover scream 
out his name). 

I jest, though: It is not neces-
sarily the males' lack of sexual 
prowess that inhibits full orgasmic 
realization in women, Most often 
it's both partners that lack sexual 
knowledge. For that maner, there 
are a number of women who 
aren't entirely certain what an 
orgasm feels like, so they get to 
feel these mildly intense waves of 
pleasure and figure, "Oh, that's 
it!" 

For those who don't know, an 
orgasm feels like every particle of 
the body has suddenly gathered at 
the clitoris to create an intense, 
almost ticlding sensation, and the 
vagina, pelvis and uterus will go 
through a series of strong contrac-
tions. 

If a woman has never felt that, 
the best thing for her to do is 
experiment with herself, rubbing 
the clitoris with her fingertips, 
using plenty of lube to leeep it 
from getting dry and chafed. 
Another option, if this doesn't 
worle, is to discover the beauties of 
the removable showerhead and a 
constant stream of water aimed 
right at the hot spot. 

Issue No.2 : Vaginal vs. clitoral 
orgasm - what's the difference? Is 
there a difference? In shorr, vagi-
nal is less common, and is sup-
posed to feel like a deeper, more 
relaxing orgasm, while the clitoral 
orgasm is more common and more 
Intense.

= 

the Chicken TIkka MaSaIa dish was actually created in Bolton, England, not India, as most would 
assume. Neverthdess, the dish is still considered pan of Indian cuisine, based on the rnixrure of Indian 
spices used as the crucial ingredients. Garam masaIa (gah-RAHM mah-SAH-Iah), the focal ingredi-
ent used in Chicken Ttkb Masala, is a highly pungent spice. "Garam" is the Indian word for "warm" 
or "hot," which is the sensation a person ezperiences when he or she consumes it. The spice is used 
throughout India and consists of a blend of spices, herbs and other seasonings, including black pep-
per, dried chili, cinnamon, cloves, nuaneg, coriander, cardamom and fennd. However, the types of 
spices used in gararn masala are not restricted to a specific list; there are many variations of this spice 
blend. To create garam rnasala, spices are groWld together to form a dry powder. If ingredients such 
as yogurt or milk are added to the mixture, then the rnasaJa is considered a "wet masala." Gararn 
masala is used in small quantities so !he flavor is not overpowering and it is added to a dish at the end 
of its cooking to ensure that the aroma is not lost. lbis and other Indian recipies can be found at

Bird Man: 
Adventures 
appeal to all 

readers 
conlinued from page 10 

ized that questioning the likeli -
hood of these stories was a some-
what lost cau se, and thi s particular 
one is somehow more accessi ble 
than the crazed adventures with 
hallucinogenic kava and seductive 
island girls. 

Madame Zoya 's honesty and 
her matter-of-fact ou tlook on Ii fe 
are inspirational enough to induce 
a New York drug baron into start-
ing a "Help the Aged" volunteer 
program, and even if that's com-
pletely incredible, itS certainl y a 
lovely idea. 

The variety in thi s book means 
that despite a very tired imagina-
tion by about page 20, it's impos-
sible to give up reading. And 
Hansen makes perseverance 
worthwhile; "Life Lessons with 
Strangers" some how manages to 
turn the ultimate travelers' night-
mare into a really stunning exam-
ple of how our Western minds 
haven't gOt it all right. 

H thi s doesn't sound like you're 
cup of tea , "The Bird Man and the 
Lap Dancer" opens with a 
descri ption of the mating activi-
ties of the official Cali forni a State 
Mollusk, the Ari olimax 
dolichophallus, otherwise known 
as "the banana sl ug wi th the big 
penis." 

The last stor.y, "The Ghost 
Wind," invo lves an Indonesian 
sailing crew learning the Texas 
Two-Step on deck, while simulta-
neously negotiatin g peril ous 
weather conditions in a race. Now 
that's something for everyone!

Co-ops: Existence again

continued from page 10 
were officially listed by the State 
Deparonent as terrorist groups. 
T he university cited Che Cafe's 
violation of the Patriot Act. 

"It wasn't merely a link. It was 
more than a link," Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs N icholas S. Aguilar said of 
the FARC link at the time. 

Co-op members asserted that 
the site s hyperlinks did not consti -
tute support for any organizations. 

"[The] co-ops took a stance to 

" 

but Aguilar said the month-to-
month system would end Oct. 15 
if an agreement was not reached. 

The university agreed in 
October to extend the deadline for 
negotiations to Nov. 14 and has 
said that it will negotiate directly 
with the co-ops rather than with 
the Graduate Student Association 
and Associated Students. 

There are many opinions 
abom why the un iversity and the 
co-ops have had so many conflicts 
over the years. 

su pport free 
speech," Bohling 
said. "[H owever, 
it could be argued 
that the] link to 
the Web page was 
providing materi-
al support in the 
form of commu-
nication to terror-
ists." 

[The] co,ops took a 
stance to support 
free speech ... " 

According to 
Kessler, the uni-
versity simply 
wants to exercise 
as much power 
over studen ts as 
possible and ben-
efit financially 
from businesses 
on campus. The 
admini s tration 
has a different 
perspective on 

After consult-
ing UC att~rneys 
over whether the 

- Kris Bo:t former 
GSAPr"ntof 
Ac.Idemic Affairs 

links truly did constitute material 
support, the university allowed 
the co-ops to keep the Web site 
runnmg. 

The latest conflict between 
the co-ops and the university 
began last spring. The Master 
Space Agreement ou tl ines the 
leasing of university center space 
to Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association, 
who in turn sublease the space to 
the co-ops. 

When this agreement expired 
on April 29, the university sa id it 
'wanted to renew the agreement 
only if changes were made in the 
way' the co-ops were ru n. 

T he co-ops began renting the 
space on a month-to-month basis, 

the conflicts. 
"It has been said ". that the 

administration wants to extract 
[ the co-ops] for financial reasons," 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson said at a meet-
ing of the Warren College Student 
Council on Oct. 28. "Nothing is 
further from the truth." 

Administrators have, however, 
repeatedly stressed that the co-
ops need to bener address issues 
of health and safety liabiliti es.

Sex: Women 
can enjoy two 
different types 

of orgasms 
continued from page J:l 

The way of the clitoris is very 
self-explanatory: Continuous stim-
ulation of the happy button with 
either a finger or tongue will send 
the woman into a glorious climax. 
The amount of rubbing and pres-
sure is different for every woman, 
especially during oral sex, so her 
parmer has to be willing to accom-
modate and experiment with dif-
ferent pressures and speeds. 

The vaginal orgasm is achieved 
by constant stimulation of the G-
spot (yes, it exists!). To find it 
while the woman lays on her back, 
place one or two well lubricated 
fingers about two inches inside 
the vagina, make a pressurized 
"come hither" motion, and on the 
roof of the vagina you'll feel a 
spongy, nickel-sized area that will 
enlarge with arousal. You may 
have to press a little hard to find 
it, but both partners will definite-
ly lrnow if the right area is being 
touched. This may give the 
woman the urge to urinate, so 
empty bladders are a definite plus 
during this activity. 

Although some women swear 
by one form of climax or the other, 
really, why setfle for one when two 
are more fun? 

Learning to identify and enjoy 
both pleasure points is key to a 
complete orgasmic experience. 
During oral or finger play, this is 
achieved by loving the G-spot 
with the finger while rubbing the 
clitoris with either tongue or 
thumb. 

To climax during sex is a differ-
ent matter. With the man on top 
and the woman lying down, the 
best position is for him to be 
raised on his lrnees, pushing more 
forward than down. This will 
stimulate the elusive G-spot. 
Although some women can come 
with just this, if it isn't working, 
the woman should wet her fingers 
with saliva or K-Y and rub her cli-
toris. Yes, women, you need to 
learn to touch yourselves. 

Not only will this help you 
achieve an orgasm during sex, but 
men think it's really hot, especially 
if they see it during foreplay. I 
mean, if you're afraid to go down 
there yourself, why should they? 

Also, any sexual position from 
behind is a pleasure paradise, 
because the penis makes full con-
tact with sensitive areas, and 
allows your partner's lubricated 
fingen more freedom to excite the 
clitoris. 

This takes a little coordination, 
but any man can surprise his part-
ner by venturing to undentand 
her anatomy as well as she does. 

All in all, remember this: To get 
to that moment of screaming cul-
mination, both partners should 
stimulate G- and C-spots as much 
as possible while knocking boots. 
It is the true pathway to female 
orgasm.

injuries for rest of postseason conlinued from page :l0 off a little bit." 

Game one saw the Tritons and 
Toros tying several times. At 17 -17, 
UCSD scored four straight points 
under Dunsmore's serve to take the 
game's first big lead. Cal State 
Dominguez Hills' senior middle 
blocker Vivian Maxie put away a 
IeiU to side out for the Taros. Ohta 
responded with a lcill to bring the 
serve back to the Tritons. With 
Hogan serving, UCSD tallied five 
straight points, extending its lead to 
27-18. Dunsmore added a kill to 
put the Tritons at match point, 29-
20. The Taros held on to save five 
match points. Canape registered a 
kill to finish game one, 30-25. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
UCSD played evenly to tie things 
up at 12-12 in game two before 

the Tritons took charge and 
claimed the lead at 17-16 with a 
leill by Hogan. She proved to be 
clutch late in the game, using a kill 
to end a long rally, teaming up 
with Ohta for a block and another 
leill to put UCSD at game point, 
29-23 . The Taros responded with 
a leill and a block of their own, but 
senior outside hitter Christine 
Tran served into the net to help 
the Tritons take game two, 30-25. 

Hogan and Dunsmore tallied a 
block to break the 7 -7 rie in game 
three giving UCSD a lead it never 
surrendered to win the match, 30-
22. Although the Tritons' perfor-
mances in both matches concern 
McFarland, he is optimistic that 
his team will turn things around. 

"But the good news is that nOf-
mally you don't want to be peak-

ing now anyway, so it lets us know 
that we have some things to work 
on," he said. "We leind of had 
trouble with the big bloclc.s that 
Dominguez put up, so we're going 
to practice that." 

The match against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was Senior 
Night, when seven Tritons were 
honored before the match : 
Canape, Dunsmore, Hogan, 
Ohta, defensive specialistllibero 
Robin Parlette, WIlson and out-
side hitter Kelsey Wiedenhoefer. 

"It's been amazing, and I've 
loved it so much," Wilson said of 
her time playing at UCSD. "r 
actually wasn't here my freshman 
year, but 1 don't feel like it all. I 
feel I ike I've been here four years. 
I'm so excited to be here and have 
been able to play at this school. n 

conrinutd from page ~o 
have qualified for the NCAA 
Regionals every year since 1987 
under Brian McManus. UCSD will 
be notified of its berth in the 
Regionals on Nov. 8 after the final 
Far West Region rankings are post-
ed. The Regionals will be held the 
second week of November in Seattle. 

"It will probably be, hopefully, 
us and Dominguez to go to Seattle 
next week to play the Regionals," 
McManus said. 

Coming inro the semifinal 
game, UCSD was determined to 
play strong right off of the whistle, 
according to freshman defender 
Nicole Pepper. 

"We wanted to play hard and 
just do really well," she said. 

we have a bit of a lack of experience," 
McManus said. "A minute and a hal f 
to halftime, we let down a little bit 
and gave up a goal. But that happens, 
that comes with experience." 

Tritons: Team hopes for berth in Regionals 
Determined to play aggressive-

ly, the 1rirons controlled the ball 
and kept the Taros in their defen-
sive zone early in the opening half. 
UCSD got its first chance in the 
second minute off a corner kick by 
senior mid fielder Jaclyn Shaffer, 
sending the ball to sophomore 
midfielder Heather Sugg. She 
headed it toward the net, but Toro 
goalie Mallory Dominguez came 
up with a save. The Tritons had five 
corner kicks in the first half, com-
pared to one for the Toros, but 
were unable to convert them. 

It remained a right battle 
between UCSD and Cal State 
Dominguez Hjlls in the second half, 
with each team trading scoring 
chances. The Tritons almost tied 
the match with less than \ 0 minutes 
left. Sophomore mjdfielder Megan 
Dickey senr a free kick up the mid-
dle for freshman midfielder Ali Lai . 
She fed the ball to Sugg, who took a 
quick shot that Dominguez deflect-
ed into the tOp of the cros>uar, bur 
bounced out to save a game-tying 
goal. The Taros held on tor the win. 
advancing them to the nnah a~ainsl 
Chico State on Nov. 7. RC\\llrS of 
the match were un3vallable at press 
time. 

The Taros and the Trnons arc 
the teams favored for selenion to 
play in the CAA Regionals. If 
both teams face off again, UCSD 
will be looking to avenge its loss to 
Cal State Dominguez [-hils. 

concinued from page 20 
fielder German Bravo finally put 
one past Wicks. 

Jason Doss-Carter opened the 
match up again then, giving the 
Roadrunners the lead at 2-\' 
Sophomore defenseman Dustin 
Tannenhaus had the chance to tie 
it one last time, but his shot, 
which was aimed at the upper left 
corner of the net, sailed above the 
posts. The miss set up a clinching 
opportunity for the Roadrunners . 
If Cal Slate Bakersfield's Matt 
O'Sullivan could get the ball to 
the back of the net, the 
Roadrunners would have a 3-\ 
lead with only one lcick left for the 
Tritons. O'Sullivan went left with 
the ball that got past Ruhland and 
propelled the Roadrunners into 
the CCAA championship game. 

"We got them into double 

overtime, and we played very 
well," senior defenseman Luke 
Russell said. "But we missed some 
opportunities and they converted 
on some. [ still feel that we are the 
bener team." 

With the loss, the Tritons fall 
to 9-4-4 on the season, which was 
filled with both disappointing 
losses and clutch victories. 
Although UCSD barely made the 
CCAA playoffs, the team still 
hopes to make it into the NCAA 
tournament. 

"I'd love the opportunity to 
play another game," Russell said. 
"We've just been playing really 
w.ell. " 

Russell, a senior, is very hopeful 
that the Tritons will get into the 
NCAA bracket, because if they do 
not, the loss to Cal State 
Bakersfield was the last game of his 

career at UCSD. 
"I'm really proud of myself and 

my other senior teammates," he 
said. "Playing college ball is hard 
and we stuck with it. 1 had a great 
time playing soccer here at 
UCSD." 

Despite the playoff shortfall, 
this season was a historic one, as 
23-year head coach Derek 
Armstrong garnered his 300th 
career match on Oct. 15 against 
Chico State. Armstrong joined 
UCSD women's soccer coach 
Brian McManus in the 300-win 
club, making the pair the first 
simultaneously acrive coaches in 
NCAA history to each have 300 
wins at the same school. 

The CCAA Championship 
finals was played on Nov. 7 but 
results were unavailable at press 
rime. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills 
broke the scoreless rie in the closing 
minutes of the first half to steal the 
momentum from UCSD. Toro for-
ward Rachele McDonald sent the 
ball up to Michelle Sena, who beat 
two Tritons to feed a pass to Walsh. 
Walsh sailed the ball over a leaping 
Triton goalie Jamie Lautenschleger 
into the upper left corner for the 
game's only goal. 

"Dominguez, they're a strong 
team (with] a lot of experience and 

"In case we have to meet up 
with them again , we're JUS t goi ng 
to rethink our play and just get in 
and do the best we can," Pepper 
said. "Right now, we JUSt have to 
get injuries taken care of. We nced 
to get healthy and get read)' for the 
Regionals." 

The next week will allow the 
injured Tritons, such as j llnior 
defender H ea ther Szafranicc and 
Sugg, some time to heal. .\Ic,\l anlls 
is optimistic about CCSD's 
chances at Rcgionals. 

"I think we're going to ~ a little 
ntter, a little bit morc restt.:d, and 
that will make that a little bit easier 
Oll us and we'll rake it /Tom there." 
he said.

UCSD loses CCAA semifinals 
Women's soccer falls to Dominguez, 1-0 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVU 
Associate Sports Editor 

Each year since UCSD women's ' 
soccer moved up to NCAA Division 
II in 2000, it has not only earned a 
spot in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships, but has emerged 
victorious every time, going 8-0. 
The Tritons finished this season 
with their fifth-straight South 

Divisio~ title and were looking to 
hand head coach Brian McManus 
his fifth consecutive CCAA 
Championship. However, fourth-
seeded Cal State Dominguez Hills 
played spoiler and gave top-seeded 
UCSD a 1-0 loss in the CCAA 
Semifinals on Nov. 5 in Carson, 
Calif. Toro sophomore midfielder 
Kristen Walsh scored the game-win-
ning goal in the first half of the 
match. 

"They played tremendously," 
McManus said of his team. "It was 
a tremendous effort. It was always 
going to be just one mistake and 
we made one mistake. That was 
the bottom line - it was always

Although the Tritons were sent 
home early in the CCAA tourna-
ment, they will likely qualify for one 
of the four spots in the NCAA 
Division IT Regionals because they 
currently sit in second place behind 
Seattle University in the NCAA Far 
West Region rankings. The Tritons

in conference semifinals 
Tritons lose 3-1 in penalty kicks 

to Cal State Bakersfield

Staff Writer 
The UCSD men's soccer team 

must sit and wait for the announce-
ment of the three-team NCAA Far 
West Regional bracket and hope to 
play another game this season fol-
lowing a loss in penalty kicks to Cal 
State Bakersfield on Nov. 5. 

The Tritons took. on the 
Roadrunners in Carson, Calif. in 
the semifinal round of the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, and lost 3 -1 in the 
penalty kick round. This means 
that the Tritons will not get to play 
in the CCAA championship game. 
They still have a chance at the 
NCAA Division II playoffs, which 
begin on Nov. 11. The announce-
ment will come Nov. 8 and the 
Tritons, who were seeded No. 3 in 
the CCAA tournament, have a 
decent chance at being selected by 
the NCAA to play at Regionals. 

The Tritons were hoping for a 
CCAA championship as well, but 
the Roadrunners showed them a 
harsh reality. UC D scored first in 
the 14th minute, when junior mid-
fielder Grant Nishio scored from 
six yards out off junior mid fielder 
Matt Davey'S rebound. 

Cal State Bakersfield did not 
lose confidence and tied the game 
in the 27th minute. Roadrunner 

Daniel Juarez beat UCSD goal-
keeper Edward Ruhland by putting 
the ball near the far post with a low 
shot. Although both teams tried to 
take the lead in the second period, 
both defenses held strong and 
brought the game into double 

. overtime. Finally, with a 1-1 tie 
after double overtime, the penalty 
kick round began. 

Sophomore defensemanlmid-
fielder Chase Douglas came up first 
with a chance to start the Tritons 
off with some momentum, but his 
ball hit the post and sailed away 
from the net. The Roadrunners 
sent Drew Rea to take the first 
shot, but Ruhland made a crucial 
save to keep the game tied. 

Davey, the Tritons' point leader 
this season with seven goals and six 
assists, an All-CCAA First Team 
member and an All-American, had 
a golden opportunity to give 
UCSD a lead. Roadrunner goal-
keeper Chris Wicks made one of 
his four saves in the game on 
Davey's kick and kept the game 
knotted. 

Juarez, who beat Ruhland to tie 
the game in the first period, beat 
the Triton goalk.eeper once more, 
this time for the Roadrunners' first 
lead of the game. The lead was 
short-lived, as sophomore mid-

No. 8 men's water polo 
upset at Canyonview Pool 

No. 2 Tritons sweep twice at home 
Women's volleyball bids farewell to seven seniors 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

In his final regular-season match 
at Canyonview Pool, UCSD senior 
captain Nate Cooper was honored 
on Nov. 3 at Senior Night as the 
only graduating player on the No.8 
Tritons men's water polo team. 
Then, as if to make a final impres-
sion on the 306 fans in attendance 
for the match against No. 11 
Pepperdine, he led the Tritons 
offense with a pair of goals. 
However, the effort was not enough 
to prevent the visiting Waves from 
upsetting UCSD, 7-5. 

The match opened with a 1-0 
shutout first period in the Tritons' 
favor. Cooper scored his first late in 
the quarter, as Pepperdine struggled 
to get its offense fired up. 
Unfortunately for UCSD, this did 
not last beyond the first seven min-
utes of play. The Waves' freshman 
drivers Adam Hewko and Grant 
Miller tallied back-to-back goals 
within two minutes of the start of the 
second quarter, giving their team the 
2-1 advantage. But in a quarter that 
saw six total goals, which knotted the 
score three times, both teams' offens-
es were just getting warmed up. 

Triton freshman driver Adnan 
J erkovic netted his only score of the 
game with four minutes, 15 seconds 
to play in the half, but it took only 
19 cconds before Pepperdine 
sophomore Doug Mann stole the 
lead back away from the Tritons. 

Cooper fired in his second goal of 
the match just inside the three-
minute mark to keep the scoring 
advantage neutral going into the half, 
but Pepperdine retaliated swiftly, 
again taking ju t 19 seconds to sur-
mount the Triton defense as senior 
driver Josh Acosta delivered the final 

score going into the half to maintain 
a 4-3 advantage over UCSD. 

The Waves got on the board first 
in the second half, as Acosta dropped 
his second goal of the game into the 
back of the net in the third minute. 
With a two-goal buffer and the clock 
slowly working its way down, 
Pepperdine appeared to try to slow 
the tempo of its own offense in order 
to reduce the number of Triton scor-
ing opportunities. The strategy was 
successful for the better part of the 
quarter until UCSD freshman two-
meter man Simon Schafer delivered 
his only goal of the match from the 
hole, with only 1:12 to play. 

From the start of the fourth quar-
ter, the Tritons knew that to win the 
game and avoid a crushing upset -
the team's fourth consecutive loss and 
seventh of its last 10 chances - they 
would need to outscore Pepperdine 
by one goal to send the game into 
overtime, or two for the win. 

Sophomore utility Jesse Casellini 
started the Triton drive with the 
game-tying score less than two min-
utes into the quarter. But 
Pepperdine shot back almost 
instantly, wasting only 30 seconds 
before avenging Casellini's goal on a 
shot by Miller. 

The game was sealed in the 
Waves' favor at the 3: 17 mark as 
Miller drove in his game-high third 
score and secured a 7-5 victory. 

With the loss, UCSD falls to 18-
lIon the season. The Tritons, who 
struggled at their home pool late in 
2004, will take the next two weeks to 
recuperate and fine-rune their skills 
in anticipation of the the Western 
Water Polo Association Champion-
ships, which will detennine whether 
the team wilJ earn a berth in the 
NCAA Final Four Championship at 
Stanford on Dec. 4 and Dec. 5.

The No. 2 UCSD women's 
volleyball team wrapped up its 
final regular sea!JOn home stand 
with a pair of sweeps against Cal 
Poly Pomona (30-22, 30-26, 30-
27) and Cal State Dominguez 
Hills (30-25, 30-25, 30-22) at 
RIMAC Arena on Nov. 5 and 
Nov. 6, respectively. 

With the victories, UCSD 
improved its record to 25-1 over-
all and 15-0 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The Tritons need a win on the 
road against either Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Nov. 12 or 
Sonoma State on Nov. 13 to 
become the 2004 CCAA title-
holders. Cal Poly Pomona's 
record dropped to 16-10 overall, 
11-5 CCAA while Cal State 
Dominguez Hills fell to 13-12 
overall, 6-10 CCAA. 

Against Cal Poly Pomona, the 
Tritons and Broncos traded ties in 
game one until UCSD took a 16-
14 lead that it held on to for the 

After fulling behind 14-8 in 
game two, the Tritons staged a 
comeback win, 30-26. Play was 
even tighter in game three, with 
neither team taking control until 
late in the game, when senior 
middle blocker Kendra Canape 
contributed back-to-back kills to 
put UCSD at match point, 29-26. 
A Bronco service error won 
UCSD game three and the match, 
30-27. 

Triton senior outside hitter 
Bonnie Wilson led all players with 
16 kills and added seven digs. 
Senior setter Teresa Ohta tallied 
37 assists. On defense, Natalie 
Facchini had a match-high 13

digs, followed by senior outside 
hitter Stacy Dunsmore, who had 
nine digs and eight kills. Junior 
middle blocker Allison Anderson 
had 10 kills for the Broncos. 

The match against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was also tough 
for the Tritons, who seemed a bit 
out of sync offensively, despite 
pulling out the big plays at clutch 
times to earn the sweep. 

"I think they block.ed really 
well," Wilson said. "I obviously 
got stuffed millions of times; 1 got 
frustrated. They just played really 
well, they had good defense, and 
we didn't play that well either." 

Although the Toro defe~se 
frustrated Wilson, she led all play-
ers with 11 kills, 13 digs and 
assisted on three blocks. Senior 
middle blocker Katie Hogan 
notched 10 kills and Canape had 
nine. Ohta, as usual, executed 
solid sets to guide the offense with 

37 assists, eight digs, an ace and 
four kills of her own. Facchini, 
repeating the previous match's 
perfonnance, tallied 13 digs, fol-
lowed by Dunsmore, who had 
nine digs and seven kills for 
UCSD. Cal State Dominguez 
Hills junior outside hitter Ttare 
Alailima had 10 kills and 17 digs 
in the loss. . 

"I felt like we were a bit off, not 
to take anything away from [Cal 
State Dominguez Hills1 but I just 
think [because ot] the Senior Night 
and sruff, we've kind of been dis-
tracted by a few things," Triton 
head coach Duncan McFarland 
said. "But, quite frankly, we're just 
not playing our best right now, and 
it concerns me. The players know 
it, and I've been getting on them 
because we've been working hard 
in practice, but we're just kind of
