Wilson Signs Cr ... 
Enrollment Bill 
SACRAMENTO - Gov. 
Pete Wilson approved a bill 
earlier this month, that 
allows California students to 
cross-enroll in the state's 
three major college systems. 
Senate Bill 1914 will assist 
students'in the CSU, UC and 
community college systems 
graduate faster and save 
money. Beginning in fall 
1995, if a student is enrolled 
at a campus that does not 
offer a particular course, the 
student will be able to take 
an equivalent course at 
another California public 
university at no additional 
tuition cost. 

UCI Opens $33.5M 
Science Library 
IRVINE - UCI began the 
1994-95 academic year with 
the opening the $33.5 million 
Science Library. The six-
story structure is equipped 
with 500,000 volumes of 
science books and 450 
computer wall outlets where 
tudents can access data with 

laptop computers. More than 
2,000 desks and chairs and 
2,200 reading stations as 
well as 24-hour study hall are 
additional features of the 
new library, making it 
California 's largest mdical 
and science library. 

Bond Funding Cut 
To HurtCSU 
SACRAMENTO - The 
CSU system suffered a major 
setback in funding when the 
General Obligation Bond Act 
was killed in committee at a 
CSU trustee meeting earlier 
this month. The funding was 
intended as an alternative to 
Proposition 1 C, which was 
voted down by voters in the 
June election. A proponent of 
the bond act said that the 
lack of funding will have 
serious repercussions in the 
maintenance of CSU 
buildi ngs.

On-Campus Hous~ 
Filled to the Brim 
MONEY: Despite costs, students 
choose accessibility and 
convenience of a campus abode 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Slaff Writer 

For only the third quarter in the last 20 years, 
on-campus housing is full at UCSD, due not only 
to the large influx of first-year students but also to 
returning students preferring to slay Oil-campus. 

According to Housing and Dining Services 
Director Larry Barrett, there are two main reasons 
why on-campus housing is full: a good room draw 
and an effective marketing techniques. 

"Our goal is to maintain a balanced enroll-
ment. We estimated the number of graduates and 
we enrolled additional freshmen, so that the gradu-
ation rate can be highe~," Barrett said. 

Barrett admitted that on-campus housing is 
expensive, but added that living off-campus is 

even more costly. 
"As far as the financial costs, we thought we 

were keeping it pretty low," Barrett said. 
Barrett explained that on-campus housing 

is full because many students want conve-
nience and accessibility to campus, especially 
first-year students, who may not have cars. In 
addition, the residence halls also provide stu-
dents with meal plans. 

However, according to Associated Students 
President Carla Tesak, even though on-cam-
pus housing is full , the university is neglecting 
the large number of students who cannot afford 
housing either on-campus or off-campus. 

"Many students are desperate for low-cost, 
affordable housing. The situation is really bad, 
and desperate situations call for desperate 
measures," Tesak said. 

She disagreed with Barrett abot the costs of 
s tudent housing. "Living on-campus right nOw

Tesak 
Retains 
Presidency 
ELECTION: Judicial Board 
complies with prosecution 's 
request for dismi sal 
By Jonna Palmer 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a udden move that effectively brought an 
end to the two-month-Iong Ass cia ted tudents' 
election fiasco, the A.S. Judicial Board dis-
missed the case of Kif" v. Te '0 last June. 

The case filed by Marshall College opho-
more Eugene Kim , alleged that newly elected 
A.S. President Carla Tesak violated seven eJec-
tion by laws during her campaign for offtce. The 
case was brought before the Judicial Board for 
a final verdict. 

The dispute centered around a flier printed 
by the Union of JeWish tudents (UJS) which 
Kim claimed had libeled Te a ' opponent, 
Poncho Guevara, and included a University 
Extension phone number, both campaign viola-
tions. 

Guevara won the presidential electIOn by a 
margin of five votes, but wa removed from 
office by the Judicial Board because of election 
campaign violations from fliers posted by he 
Student Affirmative Action Committee(SAAq. 

Guevara claimed that he was not responsible 
for the SAAC fliers, but the Judicial Board 
called for a second election which Tesak won. 

Before Kim v. Tesok was dismissed how-
ever, Tesak and her counsel questioned the truth 
about the distribution of the nier. 

"The flier that [Kim] had didn ' t even go out," 
said Tesak. "It was almost like it was a publicity 
stunt." 

Tesak claimed that the flier in question was 
substituted with a different UJS flier that did not 
contain any of the alledged violations. 

"[The UJS] took out all of the comments. 
They took out everything," said Tesak. 

At the Jun. 13 hearing, the Judicial Board 
was unable to draw any official conclusions 
because the case was dismissed after Kim 's 
spokesman, D.A. Bartolotta, walked out ap-
proximately an hour and a half into the hearing. 

Kim continued interviewing witne ses with-
out counsel, but requested a dismissal after he 
was refused a continuance to prepare his case. 

The Judicial Board had previously postponed 
the case after three of the board members, in-

Chancellor OKs 
Gay Advisory Board 
COMMlnEE: Issues of hate crimes, discrimination 
and domestic partnership to be addressed 
Mary 8eth Sedlack 
Staff Writer 

The 1994-95 academ ic year 
marks the establishment of a 
chancellor's advisory committeeon 
lesbian, gay and bisexual issues, cre-
ated to educate and 
prot ect faculty , 
staff and students 
at UCSD. 

The committee, IllJ~~~ 

deal of publicity about the forma-
tion of the comm ittee due to time 
constraints. 

Because the end of tlie year was 
close, recruitment was conducted 
through informal channels. People 

who were known 

which emerged in 
June, met officially 
for the first time 
Sept. IS, and will 
continue to meet 
once a month to 
identify and dis-
cuss problems fac-
ing lesbians, gays 
and bisex uals at 
UCSD. 

The committee 
will also keep 
Chancel l or 
Atkinson apprised 
of pertinent issues 
and suggest guide-
lines for change 
and improvement 
of the environment 
for lesbians, gays 
and bisexuals.

explained acting 
chair of the com-
mittee, Sarah 
Archibald. An of-
ficial announce-
ment released by 
the chancellor's 
office in late June 
spurred additional 
interest. 

Thecommittee 
is comprised of 
lesbians, gays and 
bisexuals, as well 
as heterosexuals. 
Archibald, who is 
a research associ-
ate for the depart-
ment of psychia-
try, said that the

Technology the diversity oflhe 

be kept abreast of whatever the is-
sues are," said Associate Chancel-
lor Nolan Penn. " It is thi s 
committee's charge to keep him in-
formed about issues and to advise 
him." 

The committee is an admi nistra-
tive body with members selected by 
the chancellor. 

The creation of the advisory com-
mittee was initiated by a group pri-
marily composed offaculty and staff. 
After a study period, a memo was 
sent to the chancellor suggesting the 
formation of the committee. At-
lached to this communique was a 
roster risting people who had ex-
pressed interest in serving on the 
proposed committee. 

"They put together proper 
: harges, issues, etc. that were nec-
essary to show the need. It was timely 
to do it. Chancellor Atkinson acted 
Jractically and showed his support," 
Penn said. 

The chancellor appointed indi-
(iduals on the memo to the commit-
ee, and several additional members 
)ver the summer. The group now 
;onsists of over 20 people, with a 
JOssibility of expansion. 

According to committee mem-
)Cf Gerald Lowell, university li -
Jrarian and Associate Vice Chan-
:ellor of Academic Information 
rechnology, there was not a great 

campus." 
AccordingtoArchibald,thecom-

mittee wants to address any issues 
in conflict with its mission state-
ment or the UC's non-discrimina-
tion policy, including hate crimes, 
discrimination and misinformation 
about the lesbian, gay and bisexual 
community. 

"We need thiscommitteebccause 
it is important that the non·discrimi-
nation clauses of the University of 
California be enforced and followed. 
Everyone here should feel safe, se-
cure and that they have equal ben-
efits," Lowell said. 

"I sometimes find it surprising 
how unaware people areofthe subtle 
kinds of discrimination that go on," 
he said. 

Alex Garner, the only represen-
tative on the committee from the 
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Asso-
ciation (LGBA), said he would like 
to see an informed educational plan 
developed for lesbian, gay and bi· 
sexual students. '" want to sec this 
com m iuce create a safer and more 
comfortable atmosphere as well as 
visibility for queer students, faculty 
and staff," Garner said. 

"Our hope is that this committee 
will make this a friendlier place for 
the lesbian, gay and bisexual com-
mittee," Archibald said. "We want 
to educate and enrich the commu-
nity as a whole."

UCSD Receives First Female Police Chief 
SERVICE: Community 
involvement at the top 
of her agenda 
By ErIk Johnson 
Staff Writer . 

Lawbreakers may think twice 
before commiting crimes on cam-
pus with UCSD's new chief of po-
lice, Mauddie L. Hobbit, in the 
driver's seat. 

Named one of San Diego's "Most 
Powerful Women" by W~men 's 

. Times, Bobbitt took over depart-
mental duties Aug. 8, as the first 
female police chief at UCSD. 

"The role of women in law en-
forcemenl has changed a lot in 20 
years," Bobbitt said, and added that 
she is, "always called the first woman 
to do this or that." 

Bobbitt recalled one of her supe-
riors who lold her that "'women in 
law enforcement are a nightmare. ,,, 
But a few years later, Bobbitt said, 
she was his superior. "When' talked 
to him again he had changed his 
mind." 

"I:m looking forward. to work-

ing in an environment where I have 
more WDmen as colleagues, " Bobbitt 
added. She joins three other female 
chiefs across the UC system. 

Bobbitt, 46, was chosen by a 
nationwide recruiting campaign con-
ducted by a private firm, and was 
selected from a field of over 60 
applicants. She has spent all 24 years 
of her career with the San Diego 
County Sh'eriffs Department, ris-
ing from deputy sheriff to sergeant 
to lieutenant, eventually assuming 
command of over 1,300 officers and 
slaff. 

Former police chief John Ander-
1n left the office after 10 years of 
rvice and plans to pursue a career 

consulting. 
Bobbitt will command a depart-

menl of 28 sworn officers, with an 
annual budget of $2.3 million at 
UCSD. "For me, bigger is notllec-
cssarily better," HobbiU said. wit's a 
much smaller department, which 
gives you the opportunity to know 
more about what 's going on." 

Bobbitt said at UCSD, police 
officers "can do a lot more of the, 
'old-time policing' and know Ihe 

community that they are serving." 
"We're not just the guardians of 

the community, we're also partici-
pants. I warn people to look at us 
that way; not just for enforcement. 
If people have questions, we' re 
here," Bobbitt added. 

Chief Bobbitt however, does not 
believe thai a police action review 
board, similar to the one called for 
last spri ng by the Associated Stu-
dents, would be a.good idea. 

The A.S. proposed the formation 
of a review board to monitor police 
department actions following sev-
eral student complaints about police 
conduct last year. 

"I think review boards have been 
established in the past when there 
has been a specific problem," 
Bobbitt explained. "We do need in-
put, but it 's not just an issue of 
saying, ' We want a review board.' 
It 's a lot more complicated than 
that. 

"We can agree and disagree, but 
we can work togelher," Bobbitt 
added. 

Under current policy, complaints 
are addressed to the sergeant, who

BR4.1 
Adults with Attention Deficit 

Disorder are plagued by 
distractions 

Year after year, the report card read the same: 
"David shows good potential but fails to live up 
to it. His disruptiveness in class results in unsat-
isfactory behavior." Low achievement and high 
potential resulted in the constant chorus of, 
"You can do anything you want to if you would 
only try." My response that 1 was trying fell on 
deaf ears. The inevitable reply was, "If you were 
trying you would be succeeding." 

Under-achievement both in the academic 
and social arena drove me into a relentless 
search for answers. , tried to find vindication in 
many diagnoses, ranging from codependency to 
latent homosexuality to alcoholism. , am not 
codependent, gay or an alcoholic. What the hell 
am 17 

Finally, toward the end of last year, I wcis 
talking to a friend who asked me if 1 had been 
diagnoSed with hyperactivity as a child. This 
person knew all about me, my problems in 
school, social awkwardness, "flakiness," stir-
crdZiness,everything. What's thediagnosis, doc? 

I have Anemion Deficit Disorder (A.D. D.). 
This came as a surprise because all of the above 
sy mptoms, which I had considered character 
flaws, were explained by one diagnosis. 

The condition isdue to a deficiency of certain 
neurotransmitters in the frontal lobe region of 
the brain and the reticular activating system. So 
what does all this mean? How do you tell 
whether someone has A.D.D.? 

According to the American Psychological 
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 
fourth edition (DSM IV), 'The essential feature 
[of A.D.D.] is a persistent pattem of inattention 
and/ or hyperactivity-impulsivi ty that is more 
frequent and severe than is typically observed in 
individuals at a comparable level of develop-
ment." Furthermore, "There must be clear evi-
dence of interference with developmentally ap-
propriatesocial, academic or occupational func-
tioning." 

If you are still wondering if you may have 
A.D.D.,thefollowing may point you in the right 
direction. 

You know you have A.D.D. when: 
• Your high school voted you most likely to 

interrupt. 
• You stick something in the microwave for 

seven seconds. Seven seconds later, you're 
wondering, "Where the hell is thai darned ~ 
ing coming from?" 

• People refer to you as a "space cadet" on a 
regular basis. 

• You finish answering people's questions 
before they finish asking them. 

• You tum in English homeworX, and 
someone asks how you learned to wrile 
Arabic. 

• You 're finally sitting down to 
write that paper that was due yester-
day, and nature iscalling - onyour 
way to the restroom, you see the 
garage light you forgot to tum off. 
You get sidetracked looking at the 
new ding on your surfboard. "It' U 
just take a minute to fix that one 
up." Looking for the resin, 
you pull down some books, 
including Guinness' Book 
o/World Records, which 
you begin to flip 
through. The phone 
rings. It's your brother, 
with his irritating, al-
beit well "intentioned, 
third degree: "Did you 
register for your classes? 
Did you get the stuff out of 
storage? Did you get youroiJ 
changed? Did you call mom? 
Did you buy a Father's Day 
card? Did you ... 'r' You think to your- self, "I 
still haven't peed or brushed my teeth." 

The A.D.D.-er can have a very cluttered life. 
During my childhood I would hate hearing my 
parents ask me why I never kept my room clean. 
I had noelue.1 wanted to. I tried. I told them that. 
I doubt they believed me. Remember: You can 
do anything you want if you would just try. 

Now that I live on my own, it has become a 
bit of a joke to take the obligatory tour of my 
room every time I clean it. 

I remember in eighth grade when I was 
gelling less-than-average grades and had been 
dropped from my advanced classes, people tell-
ingme I could get straight A's if! would only put 
forth some effort. if I only set my mind to it. 

In the ninth grade, I decided I could get a 
fresh stan in both academics and my social life 
if I went to a new school. Unfortunalely, the 
problems developcd allover again, proving my 
problems were generated from within myself. 
This was when my search began. Teachers, 
family members and ro-worters are always 
ready to attribute A.DD.-ers' shortcomings to 
lack of effort. 

I remember takin~ • foreign-language class

in which I ended up excelling. Foreign lan-
guages are my love, but it was impossible for me 
to sit still through the two-hour class. With a 

minimal attention span and a low frustration 
level, the A.D.D.-er needs more frequent 
breaks. For all intents l\Ild purposes, I knew 
nothing about A.D.D. Ijust knew that in sat 

in that class for one more minute, I would 
explode. So I would walk out and get some 
coffee (not knowing that, though not strong 
enough and not recommendable, caffeine mim-
ics the effects of medicines for A.D.D.). 

Although I was getting an A in the class (the 
result of the huge effort I was putting in through 
piecemeal study sessions outside of class), the 
leacherpulled me aside and said that since it was 
obvious I didn't care about the class, I should 
consider dropping it

COMMENTARY: Clinton's critics have a tendency to ignore his various accomplishments in both 
domestic and foreign affairs 

GIVE THE MAN A BREAK - CLINTON PERSEVERES 
By Rob Levtnson 
Staff Writer 

Much has recently been said about 
Clinton's declining popularity, fel-
low Democrats' efforts to distance 
themselves from hi m and the impend-
ing Republican landslide. Though the 
president' s opponents probably 
weren't inclined to give Clinton much 
of a shot anyway, many are already 
talking about his fai led presidency 
and licking their chops in anticipation 
of 1996 . 

While the critics' claims may have 
a grain of truth in them, even Ronald 
Reagan had trouble at his first mid-
term elections. I find it rather difficult 
to understand why so many are so 
quick to write off Clinton. In fact, if 
weexamineClimon's record thus far, 
it seems to be one worth running 011 
rather than running/rom. 

To paraphraseJarnes Carville, look 
at the economy, stupid. Growth has 
been slow but steady, over fou r mil-
lion new jobs have been created, per-
sonal income is rising, inflation could 
not be any lower without the economy 
grinding to a halt and 10 and behold, 
those spendthrift Democrats have 
started to bring thedeficit down. While 
theeconornic improvements probably 
have more to do with business cycles 
than anything Clinton has done, it's 
absolutely certain that if the economy 
were in bad shape, Clinton would get 
the lion's share of the blame. 

Remember that the RepUblicans, 
not one of whom voted for the Clinton 

budget, swore up and down that the 
economy would take an immediate 
nose-dive if Clinton's budget plans 
passed. Then Bob Dole said to wait a 
year for the effects to sink in. Well, 
what now? Just maybe Clinton did the 
right thing. Obviously, a lot could 
happen in the next two years, but 
prospects thus far aren't too bad. 

Many complain about Clinton 's 
problems on the foreign policy front, 
but let's take a look at thi s more 
closely. First, the Bush administra-
tion left Clinton with a lot of unfin-
ished business. 

Yugo lavia: The war drags on, but 
thanks to more forceful U.S.! NATO 
action, the siege of Sarajevo has been 
lifted, and Serbia haScut off its fonner 
allies in Bosnia and seems to be work-
ing toward getting them to comply with 
a peace plan. Though far from perfect, 
the situation is certainly better than it 
was when George Bush left office. 

Nonh Korea: Unless you believe 
that the North Koreansdevelopedtheir 
nuclear weapons program in the last 
two years, you have to' give 12 years 
of Republican administrations credit 
for doing nothing. Again, while this 
problem is far from being resolved, 
tallcs are underway and the North 
Koreans are showing signs of im-
provement. 

Haiti: This isanotherfeSlering sore. 
When George Bush left office, an 
embargo was in place and the Haitian 
military was still in control. As of this 
writing, it appears that the democrati-

I .~ • 
.' .,. 

Lo and behold, 
those spendthrift 
Demorats have 
started to bring 
the deficit down. 
cally elected President Aristide is on 
his way back. The deployment ofU.S. 
troops is always fraught with peril, 
and many risks remain, but the situa-
tion does appear to be looking up. 

Finally, Somalia did tum into a 
debacle, and Clinton's refusal to send 
additional arrnorto protect U. S . troops 
resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. ser-
vicemen - not something of which 
to be proud. But lest we forget, George 
Bush sent the initial troops to Soma-
lia, and they did succeed in saving 
thousands from starvation. 

As for other foreign policy mat-
ters, Clinton's perfonnance, though 
not particularly innovative or vision-

ary. has been laudable. PLO leader 
Vasser Arafat and lordan' s King 
Hussein have shaken hands with Israel's 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on the 
While House lawn. Eastern European 
nations have joined NATO in a part-
nership for peace. The Japanese have 
been warned - under threat of trade 
sanctions - to open their markets. 

True, Clinton did flip-flop on re-
newingChina'sMo tFnvoredNation 
trading status, despite its continued 
record of human rights abuses. Though 
I personally find this dista~teful , I 
wonder how many Republican sena-
tors and congressmen share my senti-
ment. 

Perhaps the greate t accomplish-
ment on both the foreign and domes-
tic front was Clinton's erfon to pass 
the North America!) Free TradcAgree-
ment (NAFfA). Clinton led his own 
party, as well as its stalwarts in orga-
nized labor, :md pushed Lhrough an 
agreement which will be of long-term 
benefit to the United States. Bilateral 
trade between Mexico and the United 
States has already increased substan-
tially,creatingnew markets for Ameri-
can products and new jobs for Mexi-
can workers. Given the substantial 
Democratic opposition, it's hard to 
imagine how NAFfA could have 
passed if George Bush were sti ll in the 
White House. 

In other domestic areas, Clinton 
has also persevered and come out 
ahead. In one of the first acts of his 
presidency, Clinton signed the Fam-

ily Leave Act, allowing people to 
receive up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave to take care of sick relatives or 
newbom children. It's amazing that 
the supposedly pro-family Republi-
cans thought this wasn ' t be uch a 
good idea, since it might hun busi-
ness. Clinton also pushed through 
waiting periods on handgun purchases 
and bans on assault weapons, mea-
sures favored by most Americans, 
N.R.A. protestations notwithstanding, 
in addition to a r.:ljor new crime bill . 
The domestic version of the Peace 
Corps, the Americorps, i now under-
way, givi ng (he youth of America a 
chance to earn money for college and 
serve the community at the same time. 
In many ways, these th ings are slowly 
making America a better country. 

So why is Bill Clinton in trouble? 
As Ihe firs t post-Cold War president, 
Climonisdeprivedofacertainamount 
of stature which came from being the 
point man in the confrontation wi th 
communi I totalitarianism. The na-
tion no longer seems th.reatened, and 
therefore the pressure for performance 
on domestic issues has been raised to 
new heights. 

The end of the Cold War also 
deprives America of concrete foreign 
policy guidelines. In the old days, we 
just had to contain the "commies;" 
today, each situation seems 10 bring 
new challenges and require new solu-
tions. The world has become less dan-
gerous but more complex. Grounding

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, September 26,1994 

STUDENT GOVERNMENT SMOKE SCREEN 
EdItor: 

During the last academic year, 
some members of the Associated Stu-
dents proposed selling cigarettes at 
Assorted Vinyl. Currently, the A.S. 
has no official plans to do so, but at 
least one former senator is willing to 
pursue it. Is the A.S. gumball machine 
a catastrophic failure, or is someone 
out of touch with our campus commu-
nity? It is an atrocity that a former 
elected representative of our student 
body can propose such an action. 

The proposal of selling cigarettes 
suggests a breakdown in the morals of 
some A.S. representatives. Is it not 
important that eight out of 10 non-
smokers report they are annoyed by 
cigarette smoke, or that each year, 
secondhand smoke kills an estimated 
3,000 adult nonsmokers? Maybe the 
morbidity and mortality is trivial in 
comparison to a nice profit for the 
A.S. 

The senators who di scussed seil-
ing cigarettes are not completely at 
fault. The chancellor's smoke-free 
policy bans smoking in m st indoor 
buildings, but it says absolutely nOlh-
IIlg about !>Clhng cigarettes. Even so, 
the admini~tration claim it "inter-

prets" the policy to ban cigarettesales. 
How can you pull a law com-

pletely out of the air, without any 
backing? If the chancellor's office 
can "interpret" this, it can "interpret" 
away any of our rights it feels appro-
priate. The chancellor' s office won' t 
put its "interpretation" into the policy, 
though; it wants to wait for someone 
to attempt selling cigarettes and then 
officially ban it! This creates a costly 
and unpopular situation. 

Our campus just started a new 
year. We can only hope that the A.S. 
will kill requests for lethal-drug fund-
raisers. And maybe, just maybe, our 
chancellor will officially prevent the 
pushing of tobacco on this campus 
forever.

health care sy tem, providing Cali-
fo rnia residents wi th medical, dental, 
emergency, long-te rm and mental 
health care. An elected health com-
missioner would administer the sys-
tem, including funding, thus acting as 
a "single payer." Th is would reduce 

the expensive burden of administra-
tive costs as well as the large profits 
earned by the insurance industry. In 
effect, the health service system would

are frantically spending your premi-
ums trying to derail Proposition' 186, 
which threatens to cut them off from 
their source of wealth by shifting our 
health insurance into the democrati-

The fact is, the insurance industry 
and related interests are funding 92 
percent of the opposition to Proposi-

nents' financial support comes from 
outside the insurance and other profit-
moti vated industries. 

The 25,OOO-member California 
Nurses Association, along with the 
League of Women Voters, Consum-
ers Union, the California Teachers

sition 186, which wouldprovide high-
quality health insurance that can never 
be taken away.

CLINTON: His 
achievements are 
underestimated 
Continued from pace 5 
foreign policy in any kind of over-
arching vision is a much heavier bur-
den today than it was in the recent 
past. 

Clinton's problems can also be 
attributed to a younger, Iess~xperi­
enced staff which is fraught with leaks 
and has trouble conveying a unified 
message. Hopefully, Leo Panetta's 
new position as White House chief of 
staff will son some of this out and 
relieve the confusion. 

Last, but not least, is the media. A 
recent study by the Center for Media 
and Public Affairs found that B 1\ 
Clinton is receiving 44 percent mol : 
coverage than George Bush did tWI) 
years into his presidency. More im -

portant�y' Bush received 49 percer.t 
positi vecoverage and 5 I percentnega-
tive coverage, while Bill Clinton has 
received 38 percent positi ve coverage 
and 62 percent negative coverage. 
Coupled with a constant barrage of 
radio talk show hosts and religious 
broadcasters accusing Clinton of ev-
erything from philandering to mur-
der, much of Clinton 's record gets lost 
in the noise. 

. However, were I a potent.ial Re-
publican candidate looking toward 
1996, r would not be so sanguine. The 
1992 campaign of ''Clinton dodged 
the draft and can't keep his pants on, 
his wife is a bitch and Wlte for me 
'cause I'm not him" is unlikely to get 
very far this time around. Running on 
Whitewater and Paula Jones seems to 
offer little in the way of an altemati ve 
for the country. 

Despite Clinton's popularity prob-
lems, recent polls indicate that while 
an unnamed Republican might beat 
him if the election were held today, 
when you acrually add a narne to that 
Republican, Clinton wins. 
. Clinton still may have a long way 
to go: Health care reform, welfare 
reform and the General Agreement of 
Tariffs and Trade (GAIT) treaty all 
present major challenges, and who 
knows what world crisis looms over 
the horizon? But if Clinton can c0n-
tinue to fight and compromise when 
necessary, the 1994 and 1996 elec-
tions will not be ncarly IS disastrous

itself about· it; the general public is 
now finally receiving information. 

There is a theory that Thomas 
Edison had A.D.D. I would like to 
know whether my hero, the physicist

that people with A.D.D. often have a

Tree Crashes on Two Cars Library Bells Ring Anniversary 
ByM ......... VICII 
Guardian Reporter 

As if parking on camp'!s 
weren't difficult enough, drivers 
now must contend with the risk of 
falling eucalyptus trees. 

Mark Dolson and Eunyoung 
Shin discovered this firsthand 
when they returned to the parking 
lot of the International Center Fri· 
day afternoon to find that a large 
eucalyptus branch had landed on 
both of their automobiles. 

The fallen branch was reported 
to the campus police by an anony· 
mous caller at 1 :57 pm. No inju-
ries were reported. 

Dolson, an assistant researcher 
at Academic Research, received a 
call about 10 minutes later from 
campus police about hiscar. When 
he arrived on the scene he found 
that hiS brown Dodge van had a 
bro en windshield and a bent 
frameabovethedriver's ide door 

"The damage was more than ) 
had expected,n Dolson said, "but I 
think I'll be able to drive it home." 

hln, a volunteer at Scripps In · 
stitution of Oceanography (S /OI 

• • 

found that her new maroon Saturn 
had sustained a dent to the right I 
side of the tai Igate. 

"I bought that car only SO days 
ago, W Shin said. 

Officer Edward Garcia, who reo 
sponded to the call satd that no 
witnesses had been found but that, 
"there really isn ' t anyone to blame, 
it was just an act of nature .. 

According to Phil Peters, Suo 
pervisorofTree Trimmmgon cam· 
pus, this son of incident is not 
unusual. "This happens occasion· 
ally, but not often," Peters said. 
"About four or five cars are dam· 
aged each year, but no one IS ever 
injured." 

Peters said that eucalyptus trees 
are more prone than other types of 
trees to fall or lose their branches. 
He said that often branches will 
fall during warm, dry weather due 
to a phenomenon called "sudden 
limb drop ' 

In this case. however. Peters 
attributed the fallen branch 10 a 
fungus in the roots. " It was one of 
those below ground thmgs thaI you

The chimes that sound the hours 
across campus now have a new ring 
to them. The UCSD carillon now 
not only keeps tlmeforthousands of 
students, but has also begun to en· 
tertain them with a live noontime 
performances. 

Tht carillon Isa set of bells which 
are controlled by a keyboard sys· 
tem, housed m a small cement bun· 
ker on the roof of the University 
Library. The bells are amplified by 
bullhorn speakers mounted at dif· 
ferent comers of the library. Con· 
trary to popular rumor. the chimes 
are nota digitized recording of bells

Monday - Fnday 8 am - 6 pm 
Saturday 10 am - 5 pm 

at UC Berkeley. 
For the first few years of its ex· 

istence, the carillon rang only the 
hours olnd an occasional song for 
special events. 

Recently, Scott Paulson, an em· 
ployee at the information desk of 
the University Library recently 
helped expand the use of the caril· 
Ion from a time keeper to a musical 
instrument, with the support of the 
Chancellor Atkinson and the Alumni 
Association. 

"I always felt badly that it wasn ' t 
being used as an ' instrument, be· 
cause ' hat was its original intent," 
Paulson explained. The carillon is 
also played by Paulson. 

The $25,000 carillon was do· 
nated to the university in 1989 by 
Joe Rubinger in honor of his late 
wife, I rene Rubinger. The Rubingers 
founded the Institute for Continued 
Learning at UCSD's University 
Extension. Thus, the official name 
of the carillon is the Irene Rubingerl 
Institute for Continued Learning 
Memorial Carillon. 

Rubinger donated the instrument 
because he felt that UCSD lacked 
some of the ambiance of other mao 
jor universities that have bells ring. 
ing through campus every hour. 

AJcording to Paulson, however, 
not everyone agreed about the nel I 
for a carillon. 

"Frankly, I'm surprised that il 
got installed," Paulson said. "There 
were people who felt that l CSD 
should focus on being a research 
institute and they felt that the bells 
just didn 't fit with that aim." 

Paulson said he has plans for this 
year's noontime performances, and 
would like to play music from dif· 
ferent cultures and periods as well 
as feature student ,composers. 

Cesar Potes, a doctoral candi· 
date in music composition, was one 
of the first student composers to be 
featured. His piece, "Campanadas 
Rituales" was played last Thursday 
as part of the Welcome Weekactivi· 
ties. Potes said he was excited to 
compose for the carillon because, 
"the sounds of the bell giving the 
hour really captured my imagina· 
tion." 

The song, Potes said, was writ· 
ten to express the ritualistic and reo 
ligious associations of bells. "lam 
Catholic and some of my strongest 
memories from childhood are of the 
mass and of ringing the bells," he 
said. 

The daily songs, Paulson ex· 
plained, will be chosen to coincide 
with an event or special day, includ-
ing composer's birthdays, the first 
day of fall and class reunions. 

"When the class of 1969 had 
their reunion recently, I played some 
songs from the '60s," Paulson said. 

Paulson also said he occasion-
ally takes requests. "I may have to 
simplify the song a little, but I can 
play almost anything if you give me 
the music (or it." 

The carillon was manufactured 
by the Mass· Rowe Carillon Com-
pany in Escondido and installed 
Sept. 20, 1989. According to Paul 
Rowe, the president of Mlls-Rowe, 
the UCSD carillon is its top model, 
made with bells that were individu-
ally hand tuned.

EDIFICE: 
Future renovations 
in the dark 
ContInued from PICe 1. 
Construction's Assistant Dircctorof 
Architecture Jack Gluth, plans for 
thcfour-story, 134,OOOsquare-foot-
building were commissioned in 
1990, at an estimated cost of $29 
million. 

"It was basically designed around 
a courtyard with two wings facing 
the mall, containing the professors' 
offices, and two wings facing the 
east road, containing laboratories," 
Gluth said. "There were some prob-
lems over the past couple of years 
because construction blocked ac-
cess, and more than a few noise 
complaints, but that 's understand-
able." 

The old engineering buildingslill 
houses the dean 's office, faculty 
offices, some laboratories and the 
new Bioengineering department , 
while the new building contains the 
AMES department, administrative 
offices and the Electrical and Com-
puting Sciences department. 

"The building as a whole is com-
fortable, light and airy, and both 

staff and studenta like it a lot," 
Eppley said. 

Gluth added that all of the new 
buildings, except for the Moleculu 
Biology Research Facility Unit, 
were all state funded by general 
obligation bonds. In addition, the 
financial costs for the actual con-
struction was reasonable because 
the market was low, Gluth said. 

"The engineering building is a 
very nice looking building, and the 
inside is evenJllore impressive be-
cause we got nice finishes and fea-
tures for a very reasonable cost," 
Gluth said. We got a good bargain at 
a time when the overall construc-
tion market was low. 

"There was a lot of interest from 
a large variety of contractors with 
competitive prices," Gluth added. 

Classroom Building One, located 
across from the Registrar 's Office, 
is scheduled to be completed by Fall 
of 1995. The new building is esti-
mated to be approximately 64,000 
square feet, costing $12.6 million. 

According to Capital Planning 
and Budgeting EduCition Facilities 
Planner Judy Oboyle, Classroom 
Building One will house consist of 
large lecture halls, small and me-
dium sized classrooms that can be

easily converted, all Office of Aca-
demic Support and Instructional 
Services (OASIS), an instructional 
computing center and the Center for 
Teaching Development. 

"The idea here is to have services 
for students near where students take 
their classes," Oboyle explained. 
"Especially since it's near the Price 
Center, it will be much more conve-
nient and accessible." 

The new Social Sciences Build-
ing, located next to the 
Supercomputer Center, is projected 
to be finished by next summer. At 
an estimated cost 0($15.3 million, it 
is approximately 75,OOOsquarefeet. 

According to Oboyle, the new 
Social Sciences Building will be-
come home to most social science 
departments, including sociology, 
ethnic studies, political science, an-
thropology and urban studies and 
planning 

The graduate student offices and 
asocial science computer center will 
also be relocated to the Social Sci-
ences Building. 

" It should be a pretty interesting 
design once it's all finished. We 
were able to recruit Gwathmey and 
Siegel, famous New York architects, 
to work on it," he said. 

The Molecular Biology Research 
Facility Unit Three, located on the 
UCSD School of Medicine Campus 
on Gilman Drive, is the fourth new 
building, scheduled to be completed 
by January of 1995. At an estimated 
95,000 square feet, the facility cost 
approximately $30 million, provided 
mostly for by state funding. 

The new unit will contain mo-
lecular research laboratories and 
other laboratories for the School of 
Medicine. 

According to Oboyle, decisions 
on construction, funding and the 
expansion for each deputment go 
through a very elaborate process, 
includmgtheselectionofarchitects, 
designers, planners and program-
mers over the course of a year. 

"UCSD has a lot of vacant land 
targeted for growth. Compared to 
UCLA and UC Berkeley, which 
have already reached their optimum 
sizes, in both land area and students, 
they cannot expand, " Oboyle said. 

Oboy)e, however, was unsure 
about future construction and the 
possibility of needed renovations. 

"Proposition lC, the $900 mil-
lion bond measure which would have 
funded renovation projects at all nine 
UC cunpuses, the 22 California 
State Universities and 107 commu-
nity colleges was defeated last 
spring, so that makes it difficult to 
ask for state money, but we're work-
ing on it," Oboyle added.

with empathy and concern." 

For now, though, Bobbitt says 
she will be busy getting to know the 
campus. "I don't intend to come in 
and make changes just to put my 
stamp on something -I want time 
to see how things work before I 
make any changes.. .. 1 need to

Bobbitt also works in several 
community organizations, includ-
ing the Child Abuse Prevention 
Foundation, the San Diego County 
Child Abuse Coordinating Council 
and the San Diego Zoological Soci-
ety. She is married to an attorney 
who is a former police lieutenant.

HOUSING: 
Army tents a 
tentative possibility 
Continued from .,.,. 1 
is comparable, if not more expen-
sive than living in La 10lla and La 
Jolla is already a very high-priced 
area," she said. 

Tesak said that the AS. is in the 
process of drawing up two propos-
als, the first of which will offer a 
temporary solution to what she hopes 
is only a temporary problem. 

"This is only a proposal, which 
hasn't been given AS. approval yet. 
But all oflast year, we came up with 
three different proposals for Hous-
ing and Dining Services and they 
were all rejected, so we decided that 
something needs to be done about 
these homeless students." 

The first proposal places 34 9' x 
12' army tents between Thornton 
Hospital and Mesa housing, enough 
immediate emergency housing for 
as many as 102 students, Tesak said. 

The A.S. would purchase tents, 
trunks and provide picnic tables 
while the University would provide 
water pipes for showers and bath-
rooms. 

Students could remain as resi-
dents for up to a quarter, during 
which time Housing and Dining 
Services would agree to help stu-
dents find affordable housing. Stu-
dents would also be required to sign 
a disclaimer of responsibility. 

"Mosl of these students are only 
able to hop around from place to 
place or stay every night at friends ' 
places. So this would offer these 
students at least a temporary home. 
Il 's not a great thing, but at least 
somewhere they can stay," Tesak 
said. 

Tesak plans to present the AS. 
proposal to the chancellor, request-
ing the formation of a task force to 
deal with the issue. 

"Maybe this will get [the admin-
istration] to realize how desperate 
the situation is. If he doesn ' t like 
this idea, then we will ask him to 
form some sort of immediate and 
affordable housingon-campus." she 
said. 

The second proposal underway 
involves student organization on-
campus housing. 

"We're talking to banks and com-
panies to see if we can get them to 
sponsor student organizations that 
are willing to sign a five-year con-
tract agreeing to provide enough 
students for a house during that five-
year period," Tesak said. 

According to Tesak, this project 
would be fully funded by the A.S. 
and is expected to get underway by 
the end of Winter Quarter. 

Although both proposal have not 
been presented yet, Tesak said she 
believes the administration would 
reject the emergency housing pro-
posal but that it may be a good 
strategy to get the administration 
thinking about the seriousness of 
the problem. 

"I think they'd say no, especially 
since it would present a ' homeless 
image,' Tesak said. "But if they 
don ' I wanl to have tents on campus, 
then let's talk about affordable hous-
ing."

Well , one reason is because 
it is one of the very few uni-

basically decided that 's what

The RETURN of an

By AlexMMler ThI ..... 
Sen;or Staff Writer 

A 16-year Welcome Week tra-
dition tentatively triumphed over 
the UCSD administration Wednes-
day when the Un-Olympics were 
revived, followinga one-year hia-
tus from campus. 

Several hundred students 
turned out to the afterno'on event 
on Muir Field, primarily for" fun-
and-games bailie between colleges 
- an affai r mostly geared to boost 
school spirit for the new crop of 
first-year students. 

"This is a wonderful day and 
you can't help but have fun." Muir 
freshman Matt Walker said after a 
game of sprinting and water-hal -
loon tossing relays. "And I love 
the climate at UCSD." 

Thurgoo d Co llege lunior

Administ ra. r were also con-
, erncd wit h the insensitivity of 
,everal tJ n-Olympic events, such 
IS the pie-eati ng con test, which 
ney said was unsy mpathetic to 

students with eating disorders. 
The Un-Olympics were resur-

rected this year, however, with 
changes to create greater coheSion 
between the students of UCSO's 
five colleges. 

Colleges are no longer awarded 
points for winning games and the 
event's traditional trophy, the 
"Golden Shoe" was not given out. 

Administrators fell that the Un-
Olympics were successful. 

"It's one of the few times we 
sec school spirit. (Students] are 
out there just going wild. It also 

creates camaraderie between the 
colleges, with the motto ' Five 
Colleges-One University,' saId 
Un-Olympic founder and Sports 
pub Director Scott Berndese. 

"We get students out to have 
fun and get them to meet people, 
rather than standing in li ne at the 
cashier," Berndese added. 

The day consisted o~ a series of 
games - such as a tug-o-war, a 
three-legged race, rallying cries 
and a water-balloon toss - be-
tween the colleges. 

This year also featured the re-
turn of Muir College's revered 
papier mache cow, Bessie. 

Past Un-Olympic highjinks in-
cluded parachuter , police escorts 
and faux arrests, homing pigeons 
and outrageous floats.

"It's a long tradition that was 
interrupted last year," said Muir 
College Provost Patrick Ledden. 

"It creates a lot of fun for students 
and creates a sense of college iden-
tity. It's a lot of fun." 

The future of the Un-Olympics

HOCKEY: 
NHL can't afford a 
work stoppage now 
Continued from .... 38 
from the shadow of its reputation 
for providing the most entertaming 
moments when the sticks were 
dropped and the fists raised. It was 
even conceivable the evening news 
might have highlighted the best 
goals rather than the best uppercuts 
and left jabs. 

The future of hockey may very 
well be in the hands of those few 
men and women who sit at 
bargaining tables in New York 
attempting to prevent an untimely 
work stoppage. 

If they know what's good for 
the game, the owners and prayers 
will make every effort to work out 
their differences. Otherwise 
hockey may well suffer the 
consequences for years to come. A 
strike may wipe out, in one fell . 
swoop, aU of the progress hockey 
his made in the hearts of American 
sports fans in the past decade_ 

X-COUNTRY:

Despite not fielding a full seven-
person team, the Triton women still 
seized the 18th-place position in the 
five-kilometer race with ~42 points, 
beating out Loyola Marymount. 

Rose Marie Compos vaulted to 
the front of the UCSD pack, captur-
ing the 97th spot with a time of 
23:06. 

Traveli ng in pairs, Deanne

Oakeshott (24:19) jaunted to l04th 
and 108th marks, while Rachel Lind 
(25:23) and Sarah Wayson (25:53) 
took the 1 15th and 1 18th spots. 

"All our athletes are learning to 
step up," Van Arsdate said, "I was 
pleased because everyone started to 
recover toward the end of the races. 
It's. testament to their training. n 

With their successful 'B'-team 
debut behind them, tbe UCSD 
tracksters will be primed for next 
week's rigorous meet at Stanford. 
While the 'A' team will stan this 
time, the squad might include a few 
standout • B' -teamers. 

"This meet [at Stanford] will be 
the best competition we will face 
until Nationals," said Van Andale. 

The Tritons will line up with such 
division powerhouses as UC Davis, 
UC Santa Barbara and the Univer-
sity of Arizona. 

Elcb individual performance will 
be crucial for UCSD to keep up with 
the giants_ 

"Last year, Eric Goldman beat 
• out [UC) Riverside's number-five 

guy, which turned out to be the dif-
ference between third and fourth 
[place]," Van Arsdale said. "One 
man can determine everything."

UCSD Tops 
La Verne in 
Three 
COMING HOME: After 
playing 11 road games to 
open the season, the 
Tritons (8-3) matCh home 
ByD .. Kr.tt 
Sports Co-Editor 

One-third of the way through its 
season, the UCSD women's volley-
ball team has finally completed it's 

ll-game road 
trip and can 
look forward 
to its fint 
home match. 
In the' 11 con-

....... J-I..-J-"'III tests, the Tri-
tons earned the 
title of road 

. warriors, post-
ing an 8-3 
record while 
facing three 
Division II op-
ponents - and 

they still have a lot of improving to 
do. 

On Saturday night, UCSD com-
pleted its arduous road stint by trav-
eUing north to battle the Univenity 
of La Verne. The Tritons hardly 
broke a sweat. in the opening game 
u tbey cruised to a ]5-3 win and a 
quick]'{) lead in the match. 

In the second game, the Leopards 
forced UCSD to work a bit harder, 
but they eventually struck paydirt 
taking a 2'{) lead with a ] 5-9 vic-
tory. The Tritons polished off La 
Verne in three straight when they 
tallied a narrow 15-]3 win in the 
third and final game. 

Otristine Oti has proven to be a 
force in the middle of l,1CSD's front 
line. When Kristi Askeland went 
down against Chapman on Sept. ] 7, 
Chi came in and has since earned a 
starting position. In a matchup with 
La Verne, Oti filled the middle along 
with Askeland and Jennifer Cross, 
who rotated at the other middle-
blocker slot. 

"Middle blocker is a real strength 
for us. We have great depth at that 
position," Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. 

Chi lead the Tritons with 13 kills 
while also notching four solo blocks 
and pounding home four aces. 

"[Chi] has responded [to starting] 
extremely well," Dannevik said. 
"She has become a dominating force 
on the floor." 

Other offensive leaders for 
UCSD were Julie Harvey and 
Angelle Crochet each of whom 
pounded eight kills in the contest. 

The Tritons win over La Verne 
followed an impressive victory over 
Division II CSU Dominguez Hills 
on Wed., Sept. 21. UCSD was re-

, bounding from a poorly played 
match against Occ:idcntsl the previ-

In tbe opening gami\, the Tritons

' . UCSD deliver a crushing 15-4 de-
feat to the Toros to snatch a com-

M.SOCCER: 
Tritons fall to 
Westmont College 
Continued from pa,. 38 
throughout most of the game. 

Jay Newcomer gave the Tritons 
a 1-0 advantage on a penalty kick at 
.the 47-minute mark. However, once 
Jay Fisher found an open Gary Sitton 
early in the second half after 58 min-
utes of play, the floodgates opened 
for the Warriors. 

Fisher and Sitton teamed up once 
again at the 72-minute mark and Jer-
emy Tyger's tap-in shot off an assist 
from Ben Hook from the right side 
after 88 minutes of play sealed the 
Westmont win. 

The Warriors outshot the Tritons 
15-4 in a lopsided offensive affair. 

"Westmont is a very good team. 
We have nothing to be ashamed of 
losing to them ," przybylek said . 
"The third goal was not a really im-
pressive goal at all. We were taking 
lots of risks and trying to play them 
offs ides. We let guys through when 
we shouldn 't [have] and they had 
some n ice balls to the far post. I 
thought we were solid most of the 
way. We have a good team this year 
and I think we are starting to come 
around. We should be fine, but we 
can't make too many mistakes from 
here on out." 

"Our schedule is a wee bit tough 
and unnecessarily so," Armstrong 
concluded. "With two goal keepers 
and [senior defender Mike] Yen back 
from redshirting, I thought we would 
be alright. But we may have been 
too optimistic with the schedule. 
[Nevertheless] it's here and it's a 
reality we have to face. I think 4-4 
is the worst start I've seen since my 
first season, and it puts us under 
pressure considerably. We have got 
to put the past behind us, and no-
body can let up at all the rest of the 
way through." 

Especially not lone goal keeper 
George Allison. Without him, the 
Tritons could seriously be scram-
bling for the want ads.

The lead was short-lived though, 
when UCSB's Todd Schmur made a 
tough cross-goal shot from the lane 
with 3:51 left to play. 

The teams exchanged goals once 
again, anJ Ihl game was deadlocked

Each l r 1 had upportunities to 
pull ahead In the waning seconds, 
but it was Santa Barbara that finally 
bro"e th" stalemate when Mike 
Strohec"er rilled in the game-win-
ner with 46 ticks left on the game 
clock. 

Salvinski and Skaalen paced 
UCSD with three goals apiece. 

Harper was happy with how far 
the team has come. "Two weeks ago 
at the Southern Cal Tournament, we 
were 0-4," Harper said. "[At the 
tournament] we established a two-
week goal, of improving for our 
games this weekend." 

It appeared the team achieved its 
mission. In addition to Saturday's 

. showing, the Tritons pummeled 
George Washington Univenity on 
Friday, 19-8. 

Harper also appreciated the siz-
able fan support. "It was a great

The Tritons, however, have been 

steadily improving IS of late, and an 
upset was not out of the question. 
What resulted was an entertaining, 
see-saw affair in which neither team 
could put the other away. 

Senior James Skaalen got UCSD 
on the board with a sweet, two-point 
lob shot that knotted the game in the 
first period at 2-2. 

" [Skaalen) played a solid game," 
Harper said. "He was composed and 
really kept us going." 

After trading goals twice, the first 
half ended with the adversaries tied 
at 4-4, with neither team able to 
dominate the other.

B-Side a 
Hit for 
UCSD 
CROSS COUNTRY: 
Youth prevails at River-
side Invitational; Triton 
men take 10th place 
By Tedd Ladd 
4ssoclare Sports Editor 

The re 's a breaking point in ev-
ery cross count ry race which sepa-
rates the elite runners from the rest 

of t he pack. It's 
a conscious 
choice to either 
strive ahead 
through the 
pain or rest on 
one 's laurels. 

UCSDcross 
country Head 
Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale simply 
calls it "hitting 
the switch," 
and his team 

did plenty of it at last weekend 's UC 
Riverside Invttational. 

" You .::an't teach someone to 
hurt," Van Arsdale said. "At some 
POlOt In the eve nt. the runner has to 
make a commitment to the team by 
running with pa in" 

Much like previous meets, the 
men led Ihe Tnton team charge. This 
time It was due to surprisingly strong 
performances fro m Alan Grant, 
Rhodes Walton and Steve PIette. 

"We ran our 'B' team because 
we wanted 10 develop those run-
ners," Van Arsda le said. "What we 
got, however, were some great 
breakthrough .. 

UCSD men fints hed the day tak-
ing 10th place overall , distancing 
themselves from a powerful field of 
Division ( foes. such as Cal-State 
Northridge, Loyola Marymount and 
Pepperdine. 

" It was the maturi ty that we were 
looking for," said Van Arsdale. "( 
was really impressed with 
everyone elfi r ts." 

With Grant ' quick time of 27:37, 
fol lo wed closely by teammate 
Walton ' 27:44. UCSD got off to a 
fast start dUring Saturday's five-mile 
race. 

"Rhodes [Wa lton] ran two min-
utes faster than his previous time, 
and Steve [PIette] took six minutes 
off his old mark," said Van Arsdale. 

Another speedy Steve, Steve 
Varnell finished fourth for UCSD, 
grabbing the 62nd position with a 
28:28 lime. Teammates Mark Vargas 
and Richard Erkkila sprinted close 
behind with ti mes of 28:42 and 
28:52, respectively. 

"Mark [Vargas] was sick earlier 
in the week," Van Arsdale said. "But 
he really came through for us." 

ClOSing out the Triton men 's 
scoring was the one-two punch of 
K.C. Klinger and Steve Piette, who 
crossed the finis .. line within seven 
seconds of each other. 

"A cross country team is only as 
strong as the individuals on it, and 
each runner came through for us at 
Riverside," said Van Arsdale. 

As far .. , the UCSD women were 
concerned, they might be called the 
"first-year five ," but they certainly 
didn 't act like it . 

"We tried some new training 
techniques in practice and they re-
ally paid otf," said VanArsdale. "Ev:

Q&A with KFMB Sports Anchor Ted Leitner 

I f you're a sports fan in San Di-ego, chances are you already know all about Channel 8 sports anchor Ted Leitner. If 
not, ask a fcllow sports fan for their 
opinion - don 't worry, everyone 
has an opinion about Ted Leitner. 
Famous (or infamous) around San 
Diego for his irreverent altitude to-
ward sports and frequent tangents 
into unabashed browbeating, no' 
body who has seen Leitner 's work 

I • remains ambivalent about him. 
Raised in the Bronx, Leitner 

headed west for college and earned 
a degree in radio and television at 
Oklahoma State before jumping 
across the state 10 receive a master's 
degree at the University of Okla-
homa . While working o n his 
master 's, Leitner landed a job with 
a local station, KWTV. One year 
later he was promoted to sports di-
rector, and started doing play-by-
play for Sooner basketball and color 
commentary for the Oklahoma foot-
ball team. 

Later that year, Leitner moved to 
Hartford, Connecticut to become 
sports director for WFSB. Two years 
after that, he again switched markets, 
this time landing in Philadelphia 
where he did play-by-play for Ihe 
Eagles while sports direclor for 
WCAU. Finally, in 1918 Leilner 
came to San Diego and KFMB, 
where not only is he the stalion's 
sports direclor, bUI serves as a Pa-
dres announcer as well as a week-
day-morning voice for KFMB-AM. 
In 1981, Leitner was named mosl 
popular local sports anchor in a sur-
vey of the counlry's lop-SO markets. 

au_dl_: WhJ did JOU loa.o 
PIlI ............ ' 

I gOI fired. 
WIIJ? 

II was Ihe wrong audience. How 
stupid it was for a blue-collar city 
like Philadelphia to ask for some-
body like me to go work there. They 
saw me in Hartford and called me 
up and said, "Oh boy, are you this 
crazy and irreverclil and off beat all 
the lime?" And I said, "Well, that's 
what I like lo do." 

Well, they wanted it, bullhe cily 
didn't want it. ThaI city is so hard-
core, blue-rollar, sports fan - "Hey 
[that's) my team, I' ll kill you if you 
say something bad aboul my leam." 
I mean why didn'l [the stalion) know 
that? There's never been an icono-
clastic type of sportscasler in Phila-
delphia hislory and there never will 
be. The station Ihoughl I could be, 
but I came in there and il was just 
awful. I was jusl the wrong person 
in Ihe wrong market. 
Yo .. " •• 0 •• o'r dl.tIRctl.e 
atJIe, !low tid ..... evolve' 

I don 'I know, because I didn't use 
it when I first started. When I first 
staJ1ed in Oklahoma CiIY, I did some 
different things in terms of straight 
commenllry that hadn't been done 

KFMB'a Ted LeItner ................ for ........., with .... unique atyIe of deIIverInC .... de,'a aport8 with I liberil mix 01 .... opinion. 
in lhal market, but I didn't do what I 
do now. How did it evolve? It 
evolved in Hartford. When I went 
from Oklahoma City to Hartford, I 
went from a sports hotbed to a no-
sports area. 

Basically il was an outside, pr0-
fessional market. The population fol-
lowed the Yankees and Ihe Red Sox. 
bUI had no pro teams except hockey 
in Ihe WHA. So I had five minules 
10 fill every night in one of the six 10 
seven shows and I thoughl, "What 
Ihe hell am I going to do?" 

So really by necessity, I was just 
Irying to do some softer, schlicky 
kind of stufflhal would fill five min-
ules. So that's basically how il 
started. 

I mean I was never serious aboul 
sports, in my heart. Bul in Oklahoma 
Cily I wasn 'l stupid enough 10 come 
on when the Sooners lost a foolball 
game and say, "Hey, what's the big 
deal? 11'5 JUSI a game." See, I knew 
lhen thaI you don'l do Ihat in Okla-
homa, 'nor do you do Ihal in Phila-
delphia. 

So [my sly Ie) evolved in Hart-
ford, because· in that community you 
can get away with it. [Hartford is a 
community of) very highly -edu-
cated, inlelligent people who don 'l 
lake sports as a religion - like Ihe 
idiots in Philadelphia. And il worked 
out very well. 
...................... 
.. _I •• ph ..... to ,.., 

The only inspirations I ever had 
were in play-by-play, never in tele-
vision anchor. I never saw TV an-
chor sportsguys whom I liked. They 

were always guys that I found unin-
teresting and totally non-aative. So 
I don'l think there were any [anchor) 
role models for anyone my age. 

Marty Glickman, who did the 
New York Giants play-by-play in 
New York when I wu a kid, wu a 
big influence on my play-by-play 
lechnique. I don't use him now, bul 
when I started football play-by, a lot 
of his influence reflected on me. WIIIeII_,.. ........ , ....,. 

You just can't compare anchor-
ing to I stadium with 10,000 or 40,00 
people, with the excitemenl of not 
knowing whal'S going to hlppen. 
Anything CIII happen. And when 
you're describing it for television or 
especially ndio, where the ludience 
cu't see it, that's a hip. 

I never have used drugs because 
I don't need 'em. I honestly gel thaI 
much of I high from foolball and 
baseball and basketball play-by-

play. As long IS I 
have [play-by-
play) in my life, I 
need no drugs to 
get high. I love it, I 
love it. I do nol 
love the olher 
thing. I enjoy it and 
appreciate it for 
being [something) 
olher than a real 
job. But I don't 
love it. 

"I never cared for anchoring. I 
don't e.e for It now. It'. _y

It's ehal ......... work and It

Well see, that's 
a problem. That 
phrase Ihere, 
"Have all the 

.".,.., or"""'" 
There's no comparison. Play-by-

play. I never cared for anchoring. I 
don't care for il now. It's euy work 
and I appreciate that, and it's chal-
lenging work and it pays damn weU. 
Bull never cared for il. 

money you need ... ," that's an inter-
esting phrase. Having been divorced 
several times, I will never have all 
the money I need because iI's been 
taken away. That's a problem. 

But iI'S something I'd c:crtainly 
like 10 do. Ifl couldpt an NFLplay-

by-play job in combination with a 
baseball play-by-play job some-
where in a fairly nice community, 
where it wun't hczing to death and 
where the people wenn't total m0-
rons, I'd consider it. Ifl didn't need 
the money. 

Unfortunately, because of the 
personal mistakes I've made in my 
life, that wiD never happen. Between 
President Clinlon and his tax in-
creases and the state of California 
and its alimony increases, I'm 
screwed.

Well, Hartford and San Diego'." ' 
San Diego's been absolulely terrific 
because il has Ihe mix lbat a New 
York or Hartford has. It has fanatic 
sports rans who hate your guts be-
cause you say their team is no good, 
but there 's also the segmenl of soci-
ety which wants to go jog on the 
beach or go hang glide - -I want lo 
go outside because it's a beautiful 
day. I don't need to go in and walch 
• sporting event. I don't care." 

So because of that mix, it bal-
ances out. There'. a group which 
hates me and then'. another group 
which knows I'm right, that it is only 
a game. It's not sick children at.the 
children '. hospital, it's not people 
sick with cancer, it's not veterans 
who gave their anna and legs for Ibis 
country. It'llpmel It'upme.And 
ii', never been anything bul And the 
segment which doesn't lib that? I 
rally don't have any time to worry

TED: Morons and 
blown switchboards 
Continued from ~. 30 
about them. 
l,'O'ou ....... ,..,.. ..... 
JOU? 

No, no, 110. [Try] and show me a 
guy who likes to hear TV and radio 
critics calling him just absolutely 
amazing things. And you think. 
"God, I'm glad my mother didn't 
live to see this." Nobody likes being 
insulted. No, anybody who says, 
"Oh, as long as they spell my name 
right." That '5 a bunch of crap. Don't 
ever believe that. 

Everybody wants to be popular 
and liked and successful and so 
forth . And I've been successful, but 
I know there's a segment of the 
population that I rub the wrong way. 

I wisb they thought 1 was wonder-
ful, but 1 ' m realistic enough to know 
there's notbing I can do about il. 
you·,..t ..... to 
......... 

I am not going to change. And I 
know I can't go door-to-door and say 
"Excuse me. you don't know me, but 
you hate me. Let me show you that 
I'm really not tbat bad a guy." I know 
you can't do that. so I'm nol going 
to let it bother me. 
WMt· ............ pa ••• 
you ........ to ORe of,... 
ca .......... ? 

When the Chargers played Mi-
ami in-the '82 playoffs, I predicted 
Miami would win. The switchboard 
blew up_ And I don't mean they had 
a lot of calls, I mean it literally blew 
a fuse from an instantaneous 200 
calls they logged before it went on 
the fritz. The people were absolutely 

amazing. That's when I 
had a lady call- and this 

.was before voicemail so I 
actually had to answer the 
phone and listen to that 
crap - who literally 
screamed at me, "How can 
you say that?" 

"There'. a group that 
hate. me end there'. an-
other group that know. 
I'm right ••• H'. not sick 
children at the children'. 
hosplt ..... It'. a .... 1 And 
It'. absolutely never 
anythl ... but. " 

"Lady, the Miami de· 
fense is beller and I think 
they should win ." The 
Dolphins didn't, that was 
the overtime game the 
Chargers won. But this 
lady just kept screaming. 
I said, "Lady, we had an 
editorial tonight about a 
police shooting which 
ca lied for a civ i1ian review 
board and criticized your 
police department. Did 
you call in and complain 
about that?" 

The UCSD Guardian 

"No, I don't care about that!" 
I said, "OK, the ftCxttime some-

one breaks into your house at3 a.m .• 
call Kellen Winslow instead of the 
cops. See if he comes over." 

That was the most amazing con-
versation I've ever bad. 
I ............ ' ........ ,... 
lookout ...... ' ... . 
..... ..,. "1' • ...,-.. 
JOY ..... tile cwpn.ere 
PIne to .... to .... CIIWII. 
.... ...., ... .. 

Yeah, that was when I said the 
Chargers sucked and [their success 
was due] to their easy schedule. That 
actually turned out to be true. of 
course. I said I was sorry, I didn't 
say I was wrong. 

The truth was that they were beat· 
ing up on easy teams, and it caught 
up with them the next year. So in 
essence, I was vindicated. But I 
didn't feel very good about it be-
cause a lot of people who take it se-
riously feel really bad - they're sad 
and morose after a loss. So it didn't 
make me feel good, but it made me 
feel right. 

So when I apologized and said 
that the Chargers were now swell 
and wonderful, that was another 
rather large reaction. 

But that wasn't planned and I like 
those kind of things. I don't like this 
talk radio thing in the country now, 
where guys get on and say. "I've got 
to be controversial today. What can 
I say? I'll say something and my 
partner will disagree with me ...... 

It's all phony, contrived crap to 
create controversy. I've never done 
that and I'm proud of that. I just say 
what's on my mind. I give my opin-
ion. If the Padres don't like it or the 
Chargers don't like it, I don't give a 

Monday, September 26.1994 

Tbere needs to be 
some compromise. but 
the owners have DO in-
tention of compromis-
ing. It's like they still 
don't get it. Ever since 
free agency was awarded 
in '76, tbe owners arc 
~ still trying to get back 

and kill free-agency. 
You'd think tbat after a 
while tbey'd move on to 
other things . 

Most of them are 
making a lot of money. 
how mucb do you want? 
You sec. management 
can never have enough. 
The idea is to pay the em-

"I .. ve my opinion. If the 
,ad, .. don't like It or the 
e ........ don't like It, I 
don't .. ve a damn. If my 
own boss doesn't Ilk. It, I 
don't c.e." ployees as little as you 

can, screw them as much as you can 
and make even more. That's wbat 
all of this is about. 

damn. If my own boss doesn't like 
it, I don 't care. It doesn'l make me a 
tough guy, it makes me lucky my 
bosses support me. 
WIuIt 11IU. MV. ,ou raKtad 
IIIOIt to? 

We can speak in the presenllense. 
This baseball strike is one of the 
most amazing stories [I have cov-
ered] in my life. The arrogance of 
these baseball owners knows no 
bounds. And I'm not saying I'm to-
tally objective. because I'm a union 
guy. I do fully understand there are 
union abuses just like there are man-
agement abuses, but there's far more 
management abuses than there are 
union abuses. 

So I've been amazed by the ar-
rogance of these owners. They've al-
ways been feudal barons, ti"cating 
their employees like absolute gar-
bage. So I have no sympathy for the 
owners, but I do understand that 
maybe the pendulum swung back 
too far toward the players. 

There are some grievances that 
n<led to be addressed: that the small-
market owners are being screwed by 
the big-market owners and the play-
erS are caught in the middle of it. But 
the owners' amazing arrogance in 
canceling the World Series is the is-
sue that has provoked the most an-
ger and amazement in me in my 20-
plus years in sports. 

And to watch them lie and say 
"Oh, we're so sad, we never ex-
pected this. The players are tieing 
inflexible ...... What do tbey tbink 
tbey 're being? To accept the destruc-
tion of your postseason is mind-bog-
gling and just an extension of tbe 
owners' mismanagement that has 
caused them to screw up their busi-
ness in tbe fi rst place.

Golden Season 

It was the summer of their 
discontent, but it became the fans ' 
nightmare when the baseball 
players went on strike because of 
their inability to agree with the 
owners on the issue of a salary 
cap. The rich history and tradition 
of ba eball has been tainted by 
human grced. Now, in the 
aftermath of the infamou. Iy 
historic decision to cancel the rest 
of the schedule, the National 
Hockey League season is in a 
position of extreme uncertainty. 
The possihility of a strike in the

HL loom like a dark cloud over 
what was shaping up to be a 
hreakthrough year. 

The situation entering the '94-
'95 campaign could not have been 
any beller for hockey. The NHL 
was coming off a season in which 
tile ew York Rangers broJ,.e from 
one of the most tal ked about 
streaks in sports history - their 
54-year struggle to regain Lord 
Stanley s Cup. That alone sent the 
national interest in hockey soaring 
to previously unexplo red heights. 

What s more, the NHL had 
lust igned a multi-million dollar 
tele"I ~ lon contract with Fox TV 
that would have thrust it further 
into the national spotlight by 
returning hoc ey to a major 
broadcast network. In addition to 
these landmarks, the baseball 
strike had given the NHL an 
opportu ni ty to steal some of the 
attention traditionally directed 
toward the World Series. 

With all of these factors in 
their favor, what has the NHL 
done to capitalize? Commissioner 
Gary Bettman announced last 
week if a labor agreement was not 
reached between the players and 
owners by Oct. I, a lockout would 
be put into effect. In Bettman's 
words, this would simply be a 
"delay" to the start of what was 
promising to be hockey's greatest 
season. 

However, many others feel a 
lockout would be a catastrophic 
blow to the ga me of hockey, 
which has just recently begun to 
earn respect in the United States. 
Baseball , with its title as 
America's game and its deeply 
imbedded fan support, may have 
lost a few fans, but it will 
certainly be able to climb to its 
feet again once the players and 
owners have worked out their 
differences.

Looking for a job? How about 
this one: mu t be able to stop 75 
m.p.h. rocket shots fro m every 

angle; must 
wi ll ingly 
and aggres-
sively sac-
rifice any 
and all 
parts of the 
body at a 
mo ment 's 
notice; and, 
most im-
po rtantly, 
must be 
ahle to leap 
tall bu ild-

ings in a single bound. What ' a 
job like this worth? Maybe an-
other Division III men 's soccer 
national champion hip. 

It IS now offiCial: the U SD 
men '!> soccer team (4-4) has lost 
its regular tart ing goalie, senior 
Michael Madden, for the rest of 
the eason. 

Sophomore back-up George 
Allison has stepped up to fi ll the 
void, but should All ison go down, 
the Tritons' goal-keeping pickings 
look pretty slim. 

"The boys were thinking about 
running an ad in the paper," As-
sistant Coach Ted Przybylek said. 
"With 13,000 bodies at this school 
there has to be someone who can 
help us out. We are kind of wing-
ing it with only one goalie." 

Madden, one of the key com-
ponents of last year 's National 
Championship squad, was run-
ning on the beach when he first 
suffered a slight tear in his knee. 
But after continuing to play on it, 

and re-tearing the knee twice more, 
Madden knew someth ing wasn ' t 
right. The results of the subsequent 
MRI weren' t what a struggling de-
fend ing champion soccer squad 
wanted to hear. 

"The doctors said that the sepa-
ration of the cartilage bone in his 
knee was orne of the worst he has 
ever seen," Przybylek aid. "Unfor-
tunately, his carecr at UCSD is over." 

The team has carried on despite 
his absence, beating the tar out of 
Pomona Pitzer, 3-1, last Monday 
before succu mbing 3-1 to NAIA 
powerhouse Westmont College on 
Wed., Sept. 21. 

"There is no doubt that we would 
like to have [Madden] out there, but 
[Allison] is doing well for us. We 
have to expect him to come up big. 
Thi is a big opportunity for 
[Allison] and I can't dwell on [the 
situation] ," Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "Playing with no 
backup goalie is a bit worrisome. I 
don 't know what [I would do] if 
[Allison] got injured. I do n't really 
want to think about that mess." 

More immediate on Armstong's 
mind are the flaws in his usually im-
penetrable defensive unit. The Tri -
tons easily controlled the Pomona-
Pitzer contest, receiving a brilliant 
first-half score set up by sophomore 
midfielder Jose Ocampo who, after 
toying with three Sagehen defend-
ers on the left sideline, laid down a 
perfect near-post pass to breaking 
sophomore defender Matt Chilton. 
A flick shot later UCSD had the lead, 
1-0. Yet a Triton defensive mishap 
before the end of the first 45 min-
utes of play had the score knotted, 
1-1 , at halftime. 

"[The defense] has not been play-
ing well [so far this season]. They 

The NH L, however, does not 
enjoy such luxuries and can ill-
afford to further damage its 
image. Hockey was just emerging

trounclne of the Pomona-Pltzer Sagehenl last Monday. 
have let in some silly goals and have 
not shut down the ball like they 
should," Armstrong said. "Against 
[Pomona] I think everybody played 
quite well. We were too good for 
them, a real different class of team, 
but we have to close down the ball 
better on defense." 

No such faults appeared in the 
second half. Midfielder Joel 
Kosakoff's solo effort in the early 
minutes put UCSD up, 2-1 , and for-
ward Nate Hetherington ' s score 
placed the game out of reach for the 

overmatched Sage hens. 
" We worked them pretty good," 

przybylek said. "The score did not 
indicate how much we dominated 
that game. But the defense has to 
close down the ball better, especially 
in the flat and in back. I think some-
ti mes there's a lack of confidence out 
there. Maybe that's our problem." 

Despite Wednesday 's 3-1 loss to 
Westmont (5-1), UCSD may be back 
on the right track. The defense held 
Westmont's potent offense in check
