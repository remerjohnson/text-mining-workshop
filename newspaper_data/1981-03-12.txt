~ed1tOr1al Reg Fee should not interfere with Daycare 
It's tough to be a student and a parent at the same time. 

The Registrat ion Fee Committee is determined to make it 
even tougher. 

Last week the committee refused a $16,000 request from 
the Day Care Center to make up for the loss of two CETA 
workers scheduled to be axed in September by President 
Reagan's peculiar inst itutional priorities . . 

But someone ha to staff the Center. Without two full-
time workers, Day Care will lose its state Department of 
Education funds. Without these funds, which provide over 
half its budget, the Center will cease to exist. 

In place of the CETA workers , the committee coldly 
suggests that Day Care parents make up the hours 
themselves. 

These parents already spend time each week helping out 
at the Center, keeping the grounds, cooking the food and 
supervising their children's education . They also attend 
classes, studr and tend their children at home in their 
"spare time: 

Day Care .is a basic community service, one that we get 
: cheaply and which, even at current levels, doesn't meet an 

urgent campus need. 
But Reg Fee isn't stopping there. . 
They suggest a referendum to decide the fate of the two 

positions they don't want to fund . They insist it will protect 
the center from the vagueries of their funding process (an 
admission of hostility)_ 

Such a referendum was held two years ago, and over 75 
percent voted to support the center. We can only assume 
that certain committee members who have been on Reg Fee 
and who opposed all allocations to the center two years ago 
are making a last-ditch attempt to kill it. 

Reg Fee has agreed to give a base of $29,000 to the Center 
again next year. We think a demonstrated campus concern 
and need for D~ Care and a modicum of social conscience, 
missing in the Neg Fee approach toward Day Care the last 
two years. justifies $16,000 more.

Daycare parents overburdened 
Editor: 

Last week the Reg Fee 
Committee refused the Day 
Care Center's request for a n 
additional $16,000 needed to 
run the center for 81-82. DCC 
requires t hi s money to 
continue thc employment of 
two of its four CETA 
employees . The CET A 
program was cut by Reagan 
tn his massive budget cutting 
policy presented in his State 
of the Union address last 
month. 

In addition to the decision 
not to fund the extra $16,000, 
Reg Fee voted to hold a 
campus-wide referendum to 
ask the students·at-large 
whether you want your Reg 
Fee money going to DeC. As 
many may recall, a similar 
referendum was held in 
February of 1978_ The 
students' response was 
'overwhelmingly in support of 
UCSD DCC (71 percent-21 
percent in favor to retain DC 
facilities; 68.3 percent-36.2 
percent to expand the day 
care services). 

Due to State Department of 
Education subsidy, the DCC 
is subject by law to meet a 
specified adult-child ratio. 
Without the CET A em-

ployees, parent s and / or 
volunteers must supply the 
required ratio. 

The impact that Reg Fee's 
decision has on t he children 
is devastating. It would be 
very di sturbing for our 
chi ldren to experience a 
situation where there are 
different people coming into 
the center all day long in 
comparison to the stability 
they now find in the familiar 
faces and daily routines. 
Children are very fragile 
little human beings. They 
need consistency and they 
need stability _ Many of these 
children spend very long days 
at the center_ It is important 
to their emotional develop-
ment that they have the 
security in having familiar 
faces caring for them during 
these hours. 

student to work 1\:1 or more 
hours per week. For many 
child-less student , working 
19 hours per week plus 
carrying a full class load is 
very difficult. For the student 
parent , the difficulty is 
amplified. Unlike most 
campus jobs, our job as 
paren ts does not stop at 5 pm. 
- and as all students are well 
aware, nei ther doour studies . 
We are responsible for our 
children's needs round-the-
clock except for the time they 
spend in day care. 

The purpose of the Reg Fee 
committee is to represent the 
students' needs and reflect 
this in the distribution of the 
annual budget. Holding a 
referendum is in effect taking 
the responsibility out of the 
hands of the RFC and giving 
it to the students. Every 
student has the right to know 
how his or her money is being 
spent. But, if we're going to 
hold a referendum on t he day 
care issue, it is only fair to 
hold a referendum on every 
student service funded by 
Reg Fees_ Day care is as vital 
a student service as anything 
else and should be entitled to 
the same money that other 
student services receive. 

Reagan's 'Facist' politics show 

The immediate impact that 
Reg Fee's decision has on 
student parents is an 
increase in hours over the 
two hours per week of parent 
participation currently 
required. The parents at 
DCC would find this increase 
in hours difficult to fit into 
their already full schedules, 
especially during midterms 
and finals. These are the 
times that day care is most 
critical for parents and also 
when they would be least 
able to volunteer. 

It is not that we as parents 
are "unwillini" <as Dr. Woo 
phrased it dunng t he Reg Fee 
meeting) to care for our 
children. We are, in fact, very 
willing to care for our 
children and going to school 
working towards a future is 
one way of achieving this. 
What we are unwilling to do 
is to put ourselves under 
additional pressure, and, 
more importantly, to subject 
our children to a lower 
standard of quality than they 
deserve. 

I see no logic in continuing 
to make us justify and re-
justify our need for DCC. 

A campus-wide referen-
dum involves educating the 
entire student population on 
the necessity of DeC. This Editor: 

Well, Ronnie seems bent on 
aiding the fascist reign of 
terror in EI Salvador. Isn't it 
armt that Ronnie is wasting 
millions upon millions of 
dollars propping up a hated 
puppet government in EI 
Salvador, while cutting out 
vital programs like CET A at 
home (apparently, one of the 
goals of the new supply-side 
economics is to create 
structural unemployment). 
Does this intervention prove 
that the Reagan administra· 
tion is taking a stand against 
Soviet aggression? Hardly; 
the only thing this squalId 
little affair proves is that the 
United States' imperialist 
actions are almost as 
eg~eg~ous as the Soviet 
Unton s.

newspaper I read, I read the

and UPI were covering the 
story about the Soviet.

sUfplying arms to EI 
Sa vador _ Perhaps Mr . 
Bassman doesn't know what

assume that Bassman 
subscribes to the prognosti-
cator telegram, because he 
knew before anyone else 
(besides Al Haig) that the 
Soviets were supplying these 
weapons. The 200 pages of 
documents that the state 
department said it captured 
from EI Salvador "leftists" to 
prove this story are 
~uestionable. It is more than 
hkely that these documents 
were captured from the 
Pentagon s fake documents

As for General Haig, I just 
wish he had been properly

Parents at DCC are full-

pressures asociated with 
student life. In addition to 
this we have the pressures of 
parenting. Many parents 
have outside jobs. And still, 
many parents are doing all 
three without a partner.

KAOS dangerous 
Editor: 

I read about the pseudo-
killing game called KAOS 
(Killing as An Organized 
Sport) in your paper 
(Guardian, Feb. 9) and am 
seriously alarmed. This game 
has apparently spread from 
campus to campus through-
out the nation and has even 
gained a proponent here, the 
UCSD Militant Students, 
who have reportedly planned 
an all-Revelle game for the 
spring quarter_ Is it fitting 
than an institution of higher 
learning such as UC San 
Diego should foster an 
atmosphere of suspicion, 
treachery and apprehension 
which this game would 
assuredly promote? 

I mean, at least genetic 
engineering scares, like the 
one you recently reported, are 
confined to the lab and do not 
infect the general student 
population . Even recent 

newspaper scenarios of 
nuclear obliteration do not 
create the climate of fear that 
the KAOS game does. 

Before long, students will 
be so accustomed to such an 
environment that they won't 
notice when the communists 
take over our country. In fact , 
one of the Twelve Planks for 
the spread of communist 
goals is the perversion of the 
student mentality . The 
Revolution of 1917 in Russia 
was precipitated by similar 
perversions of the student 
factions (it's rumored that 
Leonid Trotsky introduced 
KAOS there only two years 
before the assassination of 
the Czar), 

So I wOuld like to make all 
those involved aware of the 
danger of the communist plot 
enshrouded in this seemingly 
"harmless" pme.

involved with the UCSD

KAOS game who is concer-
ned about its worth to an 
individual's, especially a 
college student's, psyche and 
well-being. College students 
are under more stress than 
any other segment of -our 
society on the average_ This 
game is an excellent way to 
alleviate built -up stress-
induced tension, leaving one 
more prepared for study. 

In addition, it has been 
proven that high-stress 
situations stimulate greater 
insight into complex 
problems. Wars have been 
periods of rapid technological 
advancement, as has been the 
"space race." In the Nixon 
memoirs was mentioned the 
value that the US govern· 
ment placed on controlled 
Cold War hysteria, benefit-
ting defense developments. 
In one period between 1965 
and 1968, the New York 
Times ran nuclear holocaust 
scenarios on an average of 
once every month and a half. 
During this period, public 
support of defense projects 
rose dramatically, spurring 
great technological advances. 

There is definitely great 
value, then, in the game, 
perhaps too subtle for the 
average God-fearing citizen, 
but obvious to me. And that 
bit about the Russian

Le s cautious in his 
writings , Constantine C. 
Menges, another Reagan 
campaign adviser on Latin

detail how the dominoes will 
fall. 

"Victory for the extreme

Brown says he'll fight to 
stay on Board of Regents 
Predicts a lawsuit if senate 
confirms nomination by governor 
continued from pale 1 
long term re~ent has 
suddenly this Incredible 
spotlight zeroed in on the 
Board of Regents," he said. 
"And I suspect it wouldn't be 
such im issue to people were 
it not WilJie Brown." 

He said that resentment.. 
held toward his nomination 
is "one of the unfortunate 
burdens which I will bear as 
long as I am hereon earth but 
it isn ' t one I will walk away 
from." 

So, he added, he will 
continue to pursue the 12· 
year term, despite Attorney 
General George Deukma· 
jian's findings recently that 
it is uncons titutional for an 
elected official to be 
appointed to the board . 

At the moment , the 
flamboyant Brown, 46, holds 
two eats a a Regent. One i 
that which he was appointed 
to in September by the 
Governor; the ot her i an ex· 
officio seat he automatically 
was granted by virtue of his 
becoming Assembl y speaker 
in December. 

He has steadfastly refused 
to relinquish the coveted 
long-term position , which he 
called, "a very valuable 
commodity." 

Brown, who is only the 
second Black to be named to 

the mostly White, mostly 
wealthy board, would have to 
give up the ex-officio seat 
when he is no longer speaker, 
which is a fairly tenuous 
position. 

Brown readily predicted a 
lawsuit will probably be 
initiated to try to prevent him 
from serving the 12-year 
term, should the Senate 
confirm him as expected, but 
he did not elaborate on who 
would fill it. 

"There are enough people 
out there in the bushes who 
are prepared to go the 
ultimate mile to keep me from 
that seat," Brown said . 

There have been at least 
two other elected officials 
who served as Regents for the 
longer term, Brown told 
reporters; one a judge and the 
other a county supervisor. 
But a legis lator has never 
been appointed or served in 
the 113-year history of the 
Regents in any but the 
temporary ex·offi cio role. 

Brown , growing animated 
at times during his attack on 
his unnamed critics, said he 
hopes the Senate Rules 
commi ttee evaluates him on 
his personal merits rather 
than on what the Attorney 
General says. 

"You know how lawyers 
are, they 'll give you any 

opinion you want," said 
Brown, who maintains a 
lucrative San Francisco law 
firm and who has been 
charged lately with conflict 
of interest in representing 
clients before municipal 
bodies. 

Another lawyer, Legisla· 
tive Counsel Dion Gregory, 
who advised legislators on 
legal matters , said that it 
would not be unconstitu-
tional for Brown to serve as 
appointed Regent. So, 
senators will be able to 
choose from the two opposite 
opinions in deciding whether 
Brown gets the seat he 
wants. 

He said he would abide by 
"my colleague's judgments in 
objectively evaluating me. 

"I have the des ire to hold a 
job to which I've been 
appointed by the Governor of 
this state," Brow n said. "It i 
a judgment which I respect 
and trust and for which 1 will 
be deep,l,y embedded to him 
forever. 

Willie Brown' confirma· 
tion hearing by the Senate 
Rules Comm ittee is sche-
duled for next Wedne day. It 
appears certain that Brown 
will be confirmed with no 
major obstacles . Then, it will 
be up to the full Senate to 
make the final decision .

Roundtable studies 
educational quality 

Calling for the recognition 
that "not hing is more 
important to the future of 
California than the quality of 
our schools and colleges and 
the development of the 
students who attend them," 
members of the Califomia 
Roundtable on Educational 
Opportunity have issued a 
formal statement of purpose. 

The Roundtable approved 
the statement at its first 
meeting held March 2. 1981 
at the San Francisco Airport 
Hilton. 

The Roundtable is a joint 
effort by state education 
leaders. initiated by UC 
President David Saxon to 
accelerate work on the issues 
of student achievement and 
increased access to quality 
education. 

The Roundtable members 
are Wilson Riles , State 
Superintendent of Public 
Instruction; Gerald Hay· 
ward. Chancellor of the 
California Community 
Colleges; Glenn Dumke, 
Chancellor of the California 
State Universities and 
Colleges; Robert Rosenzweig. 
Pre ident of the A sociation 
of Independent California 
Colleges and Universities; 
and Patrick Callan. Director 
of the California Postsecon· 
dary Education Commission. 
Chancellor Dumke was 
represented at the March 2 
meeting by A sistant Vice 
Chancellor John Smart. 

In addition to approving 
the statement of purpose. the 
Roundtable participant s 
agreed to coordinate their 
outreach programs, especial· 
Iy at regional levels. to inform 
students about opportunities 
in higher education. The 
members pledged to mobilize 
the support of colleges and 
universitie for the School 
Improvemen t Program of the 
State Department of 
Education. 

The Roundtable also 
agreed to develop a 
mechanism to disseminate 
information spelling out 
specific expectations of 
colleges and universities for 
high school achievements in 
reading. writing and 
mathematics necessary for 
successful completion of 
college level work. In this 
project . the Roundtable 
declared its intention to work 
closely with teachers and 
faculty to develop and 
communicate information 
a.bout these expectations. 
Finally, the Roundtable 
reviewed plans to increase 
the number of community 
college st udents who 
successfully transfer to four 
year institutions and asked 
for further reports on 
progress on this issue. 

Excerpts from the 
statement of purpose and 
initial agenda for the 
California Round Table on 
Educational Opportunity: 

Achievement levels in 
basic academic subjects 
continue to decline for a 
broad cross section of 
secondary school students in 
California . These achieve· 
ment declines, along with 
disturbingly high rates of 
drop out and absenteeism, 
are found in rural schools as 
well as urban . schools 
serving the affluent as well 
as those in low income 
communities, schools with 
predominantly white student 
enrollment as well as ethnic 
minority schools. 

These troubling trends in 
student achievement have 
multi pIe causes . Some 
causes are beyond the reach 
of educational policy and 
practice. and the e external 
forces include shifts in 
societal attitudes concerning 
education. continui ng

If the Incomplete grading 
amnesty is approved. 
undergraduate and graduate 
students who have allowed 
their Incompletes to lapse

of fall quarter - Dec. 5 - to 
make up their cour e work. 

Current policy restricts the 
mak~·up of Incompletes to 
one quarter before it becomes 
a final F. 

The Committee on 
Educational Policy. which 
proposed the anmesty under 
weeks of pressure from 
students. is considerin.r 

revising the Incomplete 
policy to allow tudents more 
than one quarter to make up 
their work. 

On Monday, the committee 
conducted an open hearing on 
the Incomplete policy and 
received te timony from a 
handful of st udents who 
called for an extension of the 
one·quarter deadline . 

UCSD has one of the most 
rigid Incomplete make·up 
policies in the UC system. 
UC Berkeley, with the most 
lenient policy. allows 
students 13 months to make 
up Incompletes.

gun, PenholJow said . 

The officers' attempts to 
wre tIe the gun away from 
Perry resulted in a struggle in 
which at least three students 
were involved , the detective 
said. 

Perry was Quickly subdued 
and led from the cafeteria . 
There were no injuries. 

The weapon, in a leather 
case in the back of Perry's 
pant, wa a "typical 
Saturday Night Special. a 
cheap gun that does the job," 
Penhollow said. 

The gu n, which Perry 
claimed he "found," was not 
loaded , although the uspect 
did have ammunition in hi 
possession at the time of 
arrest, Pen hollow said. 

According to information 
Perry provided at the San 
Diego District Attorney's 
office, he is a 34·year·old 
resident of Pacific Beach who 
is employed as a contractor. 

"The people at his Pacific 
Beach address say he's been 
known to sleep in their 
garage occasionally," 
Penhollow said. 

A Muir college student who 

a ked to remain anonymou 
and who is acquainted with 
Perry believe he "sleeps 
most of the time on Black 's 
Beach or in the Hare Kri hna 
Temple in Pacific Beach. 

"A lot of time he (Perry) 
neaks into t he Student 

Center (game room ) and 
sleep there," the student 
said, adding that "he climb 
in through the window 
which he unlocks before the 
janitor clo e the room for the 
night ." 

Perry "hang around Muir 
a lot ," the student said , and 
"seem to wi h he wa a 
student. 

" He' really irrational, 
definitely off the deep end," 
the student con tinued. "He 
has told me that if people 'are 
traitors, he'll get them. His 
mind is complex and crude, 
and I wouldn't doubt he's 
very capable of violence. 

"He told me he's from 
Rhode Island , has a wife and 
a kid and evaded the draft 
and went to Europe a while 
ago," the student said. 

A trial date for Perry has 
not yet been set.

The 'Saturday Night Special' Perry had in his possession Sunday. 

175 rally in support of 20 
falllilies afflicted in Atlanta 

A rally in sympathy with 
the families of 20 Black 
children murdered in Atlanta 
drawing 175 people was held 
yesterday on the gym steps. 

A press release was issued 
before the rally. A partial 
text: 

The murderous acts 
committed against Black 
Americans in the last 19 
months has sparked concern 
and controversy over the 
nature and implications of 

the slayings. At a time 
nationally where the gains 
provided by social programs 
in the sixties are under 
attack by the budget cutting 
tactics of the Reagan 
Administration, the insensi· 
tivity behind using human 
misery for economic gain is 
totally unacceptable. 

The Black Student Union 
(BSU) r6::ognizes that the 
slayings of the Black youth 
are in part a manifestation of

the economic crisis facing 
the nation. We consider any 
economic program that 
institutes human misery for 
budget cutting purposes to be 
against the best interests of 
the poor and lower middle 
classes. It is important for 
people that are able to work 
and be able to find a job that 
allows su bsistance at a 
reasonable level, however we 
reject measures that penalize 
people unable to gain 
reasonable employment. 

The answer to increased 
detection of crime in the 
streets is not a larger police 
force. This method will lead 
only to increased detection of 
crime but not the resolve of 
the crimes them selves. 
However it is both necessary 
and a duty for the local, state 
and federal government to 
take t he necessary steps to 
provide for the security of all 
Americans. It is therefore 
right and just that the UCSD 
community requests through 
the signing of petitions 
federal assistance in the 
Atlanta investigations. 

It is with the aforemen· 
tioned in mind that the 
efforts on this campus have 
been initiated to show our 
concern for the Atlanta 
families and our outrJleover 
the seemingly lack of 
aggressive efforts to resol~e

Drug infortnation 
for pregnancies 
UCSD Med School helps 
in first such line ever 

Pregnan t women and 
health care professionals 
seeking the latest informa· 
tion about the effects that 
drugs, chemicals and other 
agents can have on unborn 
babies now can call the 
California Teratogen 
Registry toll· free at (800) 532· 
3749, or locally at 294·3584, 

The world's only data 
collecting and information 
dispensing center concerned 
with teratogenic substances 
(those harmful to the fetus) 
just completed its second 
yea r of operation at the 
UCSD Medical Center. . 

Although only recently 
expanded into. a state·wide 
service, the California 
Teratogen Registry already 
has answered more than 
2,000 calls from pregnant 
women, physicians and 
otbers requesting informa· 
tion about agents which 
might be teratogenic . 
Counselors at the Teratogen 
Registry continuously 
survey scientific journals 
from all over the world in 
order to keep abreast of the 
latest reports on teratogens. 

"Our aim is to provide 
pregnant women, their 
physicians and community 
health professionals with the 
information they need about 
potential teratogens so that 
these substances may be 
avoided and preventable 
birth defects eliminated ," 

says Christine Kelley, 
coordinator of the Teratogen 
Registry. " We also want to 
reassure those who worry 
needlessly about exposure to 
agents which are not 
harmful." 

By offering pregnan t 
women who have been 
expose d to suspected 
teratogens the opportunity to 
participate in a free follow· up 
program after their babies 
are born. Registry reo 
searchers also have collected 
information on the effects of 
hundreds of agents poten· 
tially harmful to unborn 
babies, including alcohol, 
cigarettes marijuana , 
valium , X·rays and pesti· 
cides. 

Ken Lyons Jones, Jr. , M.D., 
the discoverer of fetal alcohol 
sy ndrome and medical 
advisor to the Registry , 
examines the newborns for 
birth defects or developmen· 
tal problems. 

. Gerald F. Chernoff, Ph.D., 
dIrector of the Registry and 
an expert in the study of 
teratogens, analyzes the 
results of the physical 
examinations. About a 
hundred babies exposed in 
utero to a particular agent 
must be examined before 
researchers can determine 
whether the agent causes

birth defects, according to 
Chernoff. 

The Teratogen Registry's 
follow·up program is the first 
large-scale prospective study 
of fetal exposure ever 
attempted. In the past, 
teratogens such as rubella 

virus, thalidomide and 
alcohol have been identified 
by physicians who noticed a 
particular pattern of birth 
defects in an unusually large 
number of babies and, upon 
Questioning the mothers , 
found that all had been 
exposed to a common 

substance during gestation. 

Such retrospective studies 
are difficult to perform 
because a physician usually 
must see a large number of 
babies with a characteristic 
pattern of defects before he 
will suspect a teratogen,

Not everyone is the same, thank goodness. So 
at Bank of America, we don't think our jobs should 
be either. 

Fortunately, we're big enough (and progressive 
enough) to want college graduates with all kinds of 
backgrounds. Business majors, yes. But alJO people 
who are just interested in business. 

Just what opponunities are we taUring about? 
Well, you can work with urban mmmunity 

leaders. Or show young entrepeneun how to let up 
a new business. Or ldviseCalifomia's faJ11lel'S on 
their growin8 concerns. 

And what about opportunitiesfor Id¥anaerneot? . 

The UCSD Housing Office offered over 300 students an 
alternative to fretting in the stuffy, c1au8trophobic libraries 
during 10th· week. 

For the second year in a row, housing officials deemed the 
week before finals the appropriate time for students to sign 
up on a first ·come· first served basis for summer on -campus 
housing. 

And to ensure panic among students planning to stay in 
sunny San Diego during the off-school months, the Housing 
Office let it be known that UCSD offers the cheapest place to 
stay near the coast in the summer. 

The deal: $300 per student for 11 weeks for a new Third 
College apartment; there are, of course, four students 
allotted to each two-bedroom unit. 

And the catch: only 320 spaces are available, and these 
are open only to full·lime sludents who have lived on 
campus all year. 

But it is more accurate to talk in the pasttense, for by 9 am 
Wednesday morning every slot wac; filled. 

That's up to you, of course. But when you show 
us you're ready to move, we11 give you the chance 
to prove ie . 

So consider Bank of America. We've got careers 
you can really sink your teeth into.

'American Pop' flops 
Explores deviant popular music culture 

Ralph Baks hi has achieved 
a reputat ion as both a 
purveyor of animated smut 
and a cynical critic and 
satirist of American ociety, 
particu larl y conveyed in hi 
earlier films, Fritz the Cat 
and Heavy Metal. Thi 
reputation has preceded his 
lat er endeavors, cau ing 
audiences to expect caustic 
rommentary on the hypo-
crisy of American mores in 
any Bakshi story line, in 
addition to t he usual doling 
out of X·rated conten t in 
generous portions. 

American Pop, h i latest 
endeavor, to be sure 
incor porates elements of 
these recurrent themes, but 
exp l ores the d eviant 
sulx:ulture of popular mus ic 
and concomitantly chastises 
the lifestyle endemic to the 
bu iness whil e curiously 
neglecting to draw a moral 
concl usion a to the ultimate 
co n seq uen ces of suc h 

detrimental aspect of the 
business and failing to make 
a statement as to t he 
po sibi lity of making the 
business more conducive to 
r ativity , Ie inclined to 

depravity. 
The story trace four 

generations of a family from 
their immigrant beginning 

in America during pre-
Depression times through 
the '70s, chronicl ing the 
successes and failures of the 
successive son in theirquest 
for stardom in the mu ic 
business. Woven throughout 
the ta le is the drug abuse 
theme, w hich contrastingly 
accounts for the downfall of 

one man 's potential succes 
and for the ascension to 
s uperstardom of his progeny. 
Thegrand progenitor see hi 
career as an en tertainer cut 
s hort by a bullet in the throat 
and becomes involved with 
organized crime. His son, a 
brilliant pianist, spurns a 
recordi n~ contract, en listing 
instead In the Army, and is 
su bseq uently machine· 
gu nned during WWII. Hi 
son in turn forsakes his 
family to find himself, after a 
transcontinental sojourn, in 
psychedelic San Francisco 
during the '60 . He thereupon 
commences his career as a 
lyricist for a San Francisco 
band a na logou to the 
Jefferson Airplane, but is 
plagued by drug abuse. 
Subsequently united with his 
bastard son, he abandons 
him after a prolonged bout 
with heroin addiction. This 
precocious lad wheed le hi 
way into a recording 
opportunit y and catapul ts to 
superstardom, whereupon 
the film terminates rather 
abruptly and awkwardly. 

Throughout the story 
there are frequent intersper-
s ions of historical documen-
tary film clips, as though to 
impress upon the viewer the 
absolute importance of 
knowing the specific era 
during which the scene 
occurs. This is an unneces- . 
sary and perhaps gratuitous 
inclusion on Bakshi' part, 
since the background 
sett ings are more than 
sufficient to convey that 
information. 

RaJph Bakshi 

Addit ionally, the use of 
familiar music, in most cases 
original recordings from 
establis hed and contempo· 
rary artists, detracts from 
the credibility of the 
a nim ated film, especially 
when the fourth-generation 
heir apparent is given hi big

Melvin and Howard: A strange journey 
BY MIKE THOMAS 

A few years back Norman 
Mailer wrote a book called An 
Ameri ca ll Dream, an 
arrogant title if their ever 
wa one. Although Mailer 
was t he leading contender to 
write The Great American 
Nov I (even if Phillip Roth 
, ham Ie sly tit! d on of his 
book. that) , hI: powers 
wer n' t LIP to it that tim and 
th book was a rehash of 
previously stated po 'it ions 
on cancer, the moh and whilt 
make a good lay, funneled 
through .omf' of the m ~t 
improhahle dialogu imagl ' 
nable. The gr at whit whale 
contin ued to lude novelists , 
though many would·be 
Ahab have trapped 
them. elve to their type· 
writers valIantly trying to 
harpoon the elusive behe· 
moth . I was reminded of this 
the other day while \ atching 
a little movie called Melvin 
O1ld Howard. This gem of a 
film , directed by Jonathan 
Demme and written by Bo 
Goldman, is what the good 
doctor Hun ter S, Thompson 
might call a "strange and 
terrible journey to the heart 
of the American dream." 

The movie opens in the 
wide expanse of the Nevada 
desert where Melvin (Paul I.e 
Mat) picks U(l a haggard old· 
timer Oason Robards). While 
giving this derelict a lift Mel-
vin insists that his passenger 
sing. a song that he had 
composed, entitled "Santa's 
Souped Up Sleigh," "I don't 
sing," r~lies the grizzly old 
codger. 'That's why you're 
such an ass hole," replies 

Melvin, offeri ng hi guest th 
choice between his ong and a 
st roll in the desert. The 
codger ing . Th y become 
friendl y and Melvin talk 
about his life and frustra · 
tions at not being able to land 
a decent job at one of the big 
plant like Rockwell or 
H ughe '. "That's too bad I 

might have been able to help 
you ," replies the old ~eezer. 
' 'I'm Howard Hughes. ' 

So begins the saga of 
Melvin Dummar as recoun-
ted by Demme and Goldman. 
What these two have done is 
to take the infamous Mormon 
Will case where Dummar 
was purportedly left $156 
million by Howard Hughes 
and used it as a pretext to 
explore the world that Melvin 
Dummar - and everybody 
else in the country -

inhabits. It is a wor'Jd of 
dreaming and 'cheming, of 
get·rich quick game how ,of 
su burban tract hou ing, of 
Cadillac ' and mobi le hom es, 
of hit j bs that neverdel iv r 
the freedom that the 
paych ck prom ises. It i~ a 
porrrait of a country up for 
grab~ - at on ;J horribl 

pervers ion of the Jeffersonian 
ideal a nd a culmination of the 
Jack so n ian rea l ity. The 
pursui t of happiness can be 
Melvin 's El Dorado Caddy 
(which , like everything else 
he possesses in the movie, is 
repossessed) or his wife 's 
burning desire to become a 
star. (The film's funniest -
and cruelest - moment is 
when Linda Dummar, played 
by the loopy Mary Steen bur-
gen, tries to tap dance her 
way to fame and fortune on a 

game how to the s trains of 
.. atisfact ion "). 

It is the portrait of a 
cou ntr y of bu t ation 
cafet erias, of rock and roll 
and country mu ic, of towns 
\ ith name like Garden 
Gro\' and Bellf10w rand 
Anah im, home of Disney-
land, and of courst!, th tru 

Di sneyland - La Vegas, the 
heart of the American dream. 

T he cas t is superb, from Le 
Mat 's dimwitted Dummar to 
Robards' brief cameo as 
Hughes. Beside , any movie 
that resurrects Michael J. 
Pollard and opens up with 
"Gone Dead Train" by Crazy 
Horse is a friend of mine. But 
what J like the most about 
this film is the compassion its 
makers bring to their task. 
There is no cheap condescen-
sion of the characters ' plight ; 

Goldman and Demme realize 
that every bod y, (rom Howard

Commentary/William Skinner 

New Wave, TV, Film: Everything's wrong 
On the eve of an obvious ly 

spectacular event, I came to 
the realization that rock 'n 
roll is a wholesome American 
money -making process, 
whereas punk rock is a 
suicidal coercion that makes 
money from cult followings. 

mount and other big 
corporations. Now Penny 
hates "Big Wigs ." She says 
they are di s r espectful , 
dishonest , alienating , 
capitalistic and inflexible. 
She not only hates the 

popular s tudio s , bu t 
everything else, too. This 
hatred has expounded 
throughout the film . Bob 
Biggs (Penny's husband) 
produoed X's album. He owns 
Slosh Ma/ftlzine as well as 

Slas h ReCords. Penny and 
Bob have a sincere, 
surrealistic outlook on life. 
Bob reflects his feelings in 
the magazine and in his 
musical tastes. 

Bob Ferritti, on the other 

hand , was inspired to film his 
documentary on Daily Planet 
not only because he loves 
their music, but because he 
can relate to their hard-
working determination to 
become American rock .tIn . 
The Daily Planet moved to 
Los Angeles a little over a 
year ago from ChiClflO. 1be 
members of tl)e band have 
known each other all oi their 
lives and have been playing 
together for years. The film 
depicts the transition of 
changing bass players and 
the band's adjustment. The 
new bassist must be able to 
fit into a very tight family 
situation. 

Film/Lynette Tom The event was the filming of part of a movie in a night 
club. The film is of six punk 
rock bands in LA expressing 
socialistic attitudes and 
hatred for the popular social 
norms. In short , the film will 
say punk roc kers hate 
everything. A month prior to 
this phonomenon I witnessed 
the filming of the rock 'n roll 
band, Daily Planet. The film 
is based on the band 's 
trans ition while changing 
bass players, It is a half hour 
long and will be on PBS TV in 
May. 

Eyewitness a whodunit 

Each of the groups, X and 
Daily Planet, are pressing 
records to be released just 
before the public screenings . 

One point in this collage of 
interests that in trigued me 
wa the int rins ic values of 
the fil m-makers. It was odd to 
see a female in control of such 
a sign ificant happening. Not 
that women are incapable, 
but t hey have reached an 
admirable heigh t. Penn y 
Briggs was t he film·maker. 
She picked X as one of t he six 
bands to include in her movie. 
Penny's att itudes towards 
America and the capitalis tic 
indus tries are as violent a 
the punk rockers . She had 
done a few films (mos tly 
documentaries) for Para-

Eyewitness opens with a scene that seems 
to have been lifted directly from The 
Elephant Man . It consists of a languid pan 
through the rising steam, underground 
pipes and roaring incinerator of a darkened 
ba emen t. What , you may ask, does thi s bit 
of pretty photography have to do with a film 
that it touted as a murder mystery? Not 
much, I'm afraid. Eyewitness isn ' t so much a 
" Whoduni t" as it i a "What-goes-on," 
inunda ted with fal e impres ions and half-
developed hunche that will leave the 
a udience muttering Vinne Barbar ino's 
immortal words, ' 'I'm so confused!" 

The premi e of the picture is intriguing 
enough. Daryll Deever (William Hurt) is a 

~uiet and inconspicuous sort of guy, whose 
lI fe revolves around working a a janitor in a 
New York metropolitan office building, 
commuting from there to hi apartment on 
his motorcycle, roughhou ingwith his black 
labrador , Ralpy, and pla y ing back 
videocassettes of t he wom an of his 
fantasies, news repor ter Tony Sokolow 
(Sigourney Weaver). All this changes upon 
hi s di s cove r y o f s la in Vie tnamese 
businessman Mr. Long (Chao-Li Chi) during 
one of his night shifts, and his subsequen t 
involvement with Tony who has been 
assigned to cover the s to~y . In order to 
prolong his contact with here, Daryll leads 
T ony on to believe that he's hiding

realizing that the folly of his actions makes

It's the identification of the murderer that 
destroys t he storyline. The suspects ar~ 
numerous and pretty conspicious at that. 
There's Mr, Long's two asociates (Dennis 
Sakamoto and Henry Yuk), who maintain a 
cold and calculatory tail of Da~yll and Tony, 
and Daryll 's war budd y Aldo (James Wood), 
who's just been fired by Mr. Long and 
nat urally wants revenge. There 's also an 
a non y mous Is rael i woman (Sharon 
Goldman) who keeps popping in and out of 
the picture wit h annoying regulari ty. Even 
the two police detectives investigating the 
case, Lieu tenants Jacobs and Black (Steven 
Hill and Morgan Freeman), warrant 
suspicion, as do Tony' parents, Mr. and 
Mrs. Sokolow (Albert Paulsen and Irene

Tess: Polanski sheds macabre for Hardy 
What can I say about Tess 

that hasn 't already been said 
by the other film taste-
makers? They've used up all 
the ~Iowing superlat ives, and 
justifiably so- This film's the 
best thing that's ever 
happened to the industry in a 
lonl{ time. 

The one sheet in the 
display case outside the 
Cinema 21 Theater is right : 
Tess is as timely a talein 1981 
as it was when Thomas 
Hardy penned its novel form 
in 1891. His depiction of life's 
struggles to obtain the 
elusive gift that is ucce ,be 
it wealth. love, or personal 
integrity, as encountered and 
endured by a young farmgirl. 
Tess D 'U berville. is 
overwhelming. Scene such 
as theconfe sion of past sins 
and sub eQuent reaction 
that Tess and her husband, 
Angel Clare. exchange on 
their wedding night, followed 
by their breakfast conver a-
tion the next morning, will 
strike a disquieting chord of 
identification in the 
audience, single or otherwise. 
Admittedly, I have never read 
the book, so the faithfulness 
to which Tess adheres is 
questionable . However, 
seeing its SCTfen adaptation 
has piqued my interest, and 
may do the same for others 
similarly disadvantaged, to 
at least persue its pages. if 
not check out the book from 
the library_ 

My compliments to the 
casting department for 
choosing Natassia Kinski to 

flay the role of Tess. Not that was always that confident. 
Her hauntingly beautiful 
features reminded me of a 
continental Brooke Shields. 
My dou bt were alleviated 
upon seeing her in incidents 
such as a wild carri~e ride 
with her "cousin: Alec 
D'Uberville or marking their 
child 's grave with a 
makeshift wooden cross and 
a bunch of wildflowers in a 
marmalade jar. There's no 
other actress that could've 
convincingly transformed a 
literary character into a real 
person. 

The last time I heard the 
name of Peter Firth 
mentioned was during the 
1977 Academy Awards, 
where he was nominated for 
best actor in Equus. He lost, 
and disappeared from motion 
pictures, only to resurface as 
Angel in Tess. This time, 
Firth didn't receive a 
nomination, but he should 
have, what with such 
wonderful moments as 
carrying Te s and her 
church-bound girlfriends 
across a large puddle and 
visiting his family, as well as 
not so cheerful times such as 
his separation from Tess and 
his discovery that he has lost 
her to Alec. 

Leigh Lawsoh is thorough-
ly despicable ; (that's a 
compliment) in the role of the 
arrogant and unsavory Alec. 
Viewers will find it difficult 
to sympathize with this 
character at all, upon seeing 
him badger Tess into 

marryin~ him so that she and 
her famIly, recently evicted 
after her father' s death, can 
belrovided for indefinitely, 
an provoking Te s to tt"ars 
and later murder after she 
has to end Angel away. 

Roman Polan ki ha had a 
penchant for producing 
works of the ma ca bre 

(Rosemary's Baby). the 
netherworld of corruption 
(Chinatown) and bizarre 
humor (The FeIlrless Vampire 
Killers). His tragic life only 
seemed to reinforce suCll- a 
fixation . But. it's time to put 
all of that behind him and 
start anew. Tess provides the 
perfect vehicle to dojust that. 
His directiun has a 
sensitivity and deftness that 
is present even in the most 
minor of characters, as 
illustrated by the delightful 
ramblings of an old woman 
greeting newlyweds Tess 
and Angel or by the coy antics 
o[ Tess 's little brother 
kicking the family clock . His 
Academy Award nomination 
for best director is well-

deserved. 
So are Geoffrey Uns-

wort h 's and Ghisl ian 
Cloquet's bids for best 
cinematography. If they can 
take the most mundane 
landscapes, such as a muddy 

three of Tess's girlfriends 
gawk at Angel is the most 
effective use of lighting that [ 
have seen to date, while the 
countryside scene in which 
Angel is seated under a tree, 
playing his recorder to a shy 

Film/Lynette Tom 
potato field, and turn it into a 
living painting, how much 
more the pair can do to 
further accentuate the 
mystic splendors of Stone· 
henge in the moonlight or the 
beautiful peace of the English 
countryside shrouded in fog. 
The window scene in which 

Tess wandering through a 
pathway, alludes to Greg 
Toland's deep focu s shots 
from Citizen Kane. 

I have only two qualms 
about Tess. The first is the 
editing, which for the most 
part is quite good , a 
illustrated in the dancin~ 

sequence at the beginning of 
the film and the discovery of 
Alec's murder toward the 
end . But then, there are 
places where Alistair 
McIntyre and Tom Priestly 
insert nicely composed, but 
otherwise meaningless shots 
of Tess or Angel brooding in 
some field, that do absolutely 
nothing for the picture or the 
audience. The second is the 
10-minute intermission after 
the first two hours of Tess. 
Although set at a good break 
in the tory, it disrupts the 
film's flow and distract s the 
audience's attention. 

Tess is playing an exclusive 
engagement at t he Cinema 21 
Theater. 

Now comes Millertime.

this, Eyewitness really isn't 
that bad a follow-up. In fact , 
some of the dialogue is quite 
good; the on-the-street 
interview bet ween Daryll 
and Tony, the factory 
conversation between Daryll 
and Aldo's sister, Linda 
(pamela Reed), and the patrol 
car exchanges between 
Lieutenants Jacobs and 
Black. The elements of cloak 
and dagger chases, shadowy 
figures and surprise story-
twists are there, but the 
connections between the 
three - upon which a 
mystery depends to build up 
tension - aren't. 

Instead, it's up to the rest 
of the technical crew to elicit 
that moment of su pense 

from the audience. as 
illu trated by director Pet er 
Yates' and dog trainer Karl 
Miller's ingeniou et-up for 
introducing Ralph; director 
of photography Matthew F. 
Leonetti's moody Iightin~; 
sound editor Lowell Mate s 
Quirky effects for Daryll's 
discovery of the body; and 
film editor Cynthia Schei-
der 's skillful pacing of 
Daryll 's confrontation with 
the killer at the climax. 

While the development of 
lead ~haracters Daryll and 
Tony is a bit on the shallow 
side. solid performances by 
William Hurt and Sigourney 
Weaver, respectively. make 
the audience care what 
happens to them. James 
Wood is likeable as Daryll 's 

flaky idekick. Aldo. to the 
point that he sometime 
steals the thunder from Hurt 
and Weaver with h'ts rogui h 
charm, and gets away with it 
Quite convincingly_ Christo-
pher Plummer seems to have 
fallen into the "Sir Laurence 
Olivier syndrome" of playing 
characters with accents 

• other than his own native 
tongue with the same dismal 
results - Steven Hill's 
deadpan expressions and 
eq\rally as serious delivery 
make his role of Lieutenant 
Jacobs a joy to watch. As for 
his "partner," Morgan 
Freeman, any Black actor 
who can deliver the line, "Mr. 
name is Lieutenant Black, ' 
and" still keep a straight face 
has got to be good .

State of the art 
'Pop' flops on rear 

continued from page 13 
chance to wow producers in 
the studio and begins playing 
Bob Seger' "Night Moves," 
an anti-climactic debut made 
even more ludicrou due to 
the ov rsight on the part of 
Bakshi to at lea t try to 
sy nchronize the impact of the 
character's hands with the 
piano keyboard. 

Despite the film' billingas 
"the tate of the art in living 
animation" (an admittedly 
ambiguou claim), such 
glaring inattention to detail 
detract from the film' 
credibility . Ostensibly, the 
utilization of live actor and 
their action to assist 
animator in capturing the 
subtle nuance of human 
movement is suffi cient 
ground for t his rather 
outlandi h claim. American 
Pop would undoubtedly reign 
as the "state of the art" in 
Saturday morning cartoons. 
but a movie. however 
commercial its intent. should 
strive to achieve considerably 
more. 

In fact, the techniques used 
merely evince the desire of 
the producers to adhere to a 
slim budget, which relegates 
their "state of the art" claim 
to a "so what" status. The 
use of in-and-out focusing 
during close-up shots of the 
character's face is an 
inexpensive and time-saving 
but hardly realistic, method 
of inducing the illusion of 
subtle changes in expression. 

The a tion cene depicting 
trench warfare during WWI 
are remini cent of &mbi 
when animal curry to 
escape an approaching forest 
fire. Given Bakshi 's 
affiliation with Disney 
Productions, thi similarity 
i not merely coincidental. 

If critiqued solely from a 
technical standpoint, there is 
little or nothing particularly 
innovative or meritorious 
about the film beyond 
Bak hi ' gall in terming it 
"state of the art." I have seen 
epi ode of Scoobie Doo in 
which hi haunted house 
experience are far uperior 
to the psychedelic scenes in 
American PojJ. and of course. 
Betty Boop cartoons, despite 
their antiquity. are still the 
state of the art in the 
animation genre. 

American Pop ends with 
the ri e to superstardom of 
the fourth generation son, 
whose in volvement with 
drugs assists him in his 
Quest, despite the fact that it 
corrupted and ruined his 
father. This paradox is 
consonant, however, with 
the overall significance of the 
story - or rather. the lack of 
significance. Bakshi is to be 
congratulated for his 
disspassionate and non 
committal stance on 
morali ty, deviance, lifestyles 
and the popular entertain-
ment business. He succfeds 
in saying nothing in a little 
under an hour and a half, a 
record for him.

The average kid in the

access to television. If he 
does, he comes home from 
school and watches it for four 
or five hours. This child is 
subjected to a flowery white 
world that has nothing to do 
with his own reality. For 
example, he may be watching 
the Dennis 1M Menace Show: 
Dennis is a blonde, blue-eyed 
white. He lives in a two-story 
house in a white suburb.

Dennis' friends Joey and 
Margaret have the same 
dreamy life style. His only 
problem s~ms to be staying 
away from Margaret and 
findinB new ways to annoy 
his neIgh bor Mr. Wilson. The 
ghetto child is supposed to 
relate to this show. He really 
doesn't because his own 
reality is a far distance from 
this. A child in the ghetto 
frequently has no father. If he 
does, the father is uneduca· 
ted , underpaid or jobless. 
That means the father has 
trouble putting clothes on his 
child's back, not to mention 
affording the one-bedroom 
tenement that is a rat-and-
roach infested scum bucket. 
The ghetto mother sits in a 
welfare line all day or scru bs 
floors all her life. The ghetto 
child's friends are already 
standing on the corners or 
pitching stolen pennies in the 

alleys. 
Television would tend to 

frustrate the child more than 
entertain him. The world on 
the screen is unreachable. He 
can't even dream about 
reaching this world because 
his environment teaches him 
to reach money in different 
ways, such as by stealing, 
pimping or, if he's lucky, 
through sports. 

Television does have a few 
minority-related shows such 
as Good Times, The 
Jeffersons, and Chico and the 
Man, but these shows bring 
the child face-to-face with 
that which is seen daily. 
These shows don't give him 
room to create and generally 
don't promote success in life. 
Sanford and Son is a perfect 
example of these flaws. It is 
the dialogue of the poor.

The ghetto child could begin

Some television pr~ams

- such as documentaries or

He could be the hero. He

Television is made for

Minorities should spend their

Swim team sends 
13 to nationals 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
uff Writer 

When swim coach Bil l 
Morgan says that the men '. 
swim team has come of ag , 
he really means it. Last year, 
UCSD sent a team of 10 
swimmers to the NA IA 
Swimming ationals. Thi 
group captured eighth place 
in a highly compet itive field 
of teams. 

On next Tuesday, an even 
stronger Triton team with 13 
men will leave for the NCAA 
Di vision III Sw immi ng 
Nationals to be held in 
Oberlin, Ohio. The move to 
the NCAA represents a 
dramatic change in UCSD 
swimming. The Division ill 
teams are more competitive 
than most NAJA teams and 
the Qualifying times for 
Division m are tougher. 

Among the group who 
passed the tougher Qualify-
mg standards are seven 
swimmers who are either 
freshmen or sophomores. 

Leading the team are 
seniors Joe Hernandez, Lance 
Halsted, Steve Best and Don 
Edgar. Hernandez, a Warren 
student from Hacienda 
Heights, is without a doubt 
the most talent.ed freestyier 
in UCSD history. As a three-
time All American and last 
year's Athlete of the Year, 
Hernandez has a good shot at 
the finals in several events 
including the 100, 200 and 
500 frees. 

Halsted, a Revelle senior 
from Rolling Hills, is also a 

three-time All American who 
excels in the dis tance events. 
Halsted will be competi ng in 
the 500 and 1650 frees. Best, 
another Revelle senior from 
Los Alamos, New Mexico, 
narrow l) ' mi ssed All 

'\~~tS 
American honors in the 1980 
nationals and will give it 
another shot this year in the 
100 and 200 breastrokes_ 
Senior Don Edgar,a Muir 
student from Santi ... , 
will join Best in the 100 
breastroke. . 

Joining these seniors .-e juniors John Beckley and 
Mike Gautreau. Beckler. a 
Warren student from 
Huntinaton Beach, is • pat 
All American and one ~ the 
fastest spr:intera to swim lor 
UCSD. Beckley is currently 
preparing for the SO, 100 _ 
200 frees. Gautreau, a Third 

ColI~ junior from Welt 
Covina, is the only Triten 
butterflier to qualify for 
nationals. After' -months of 
grueling butterfly workouts, 
Gautreau says, "It's ' a ..-eat

AS 
Resolution 

on Day Car. 
The ASUCSD Council approved the 

following resolution, to be forwIYded to 
the Registration 'Fee Committee· 

Whereas, the Reg istrati on Fee 
Committee voted to hold a referendum 
to conSider alternative funding for Day 
Care; and 

Whereas the Registrat io n Fee 
Committee voted not to fund two CETA 
positions reqUired for the existence of 
the UCSD Day CeYe Center; and 

lJV'hereas, there is a demonstrated 
. need for Day CIYe, for children of UCSD 

students, staff and faculty; and, 
Whereas, this need is not being 

satisfactorily met by either the private or 
public facilities off campus, nor by the 
two Day Cere facilities on campus 
(International Center Nursery and the 
UCSD Day CeYe Center); and 

Whereas, there is a strong need for Day 
Care of infants (walking to two years old) 
in view of the fact that adequate Day 
Care for infants is very difficult to obtain 
in S!!n Diego; and, 

Whereas, there is a definite need for 
continued support of the educational 
component of the Day C~e Center - a 
component that is necessary for 
adequate child development; lind, 

Whereas, subsidized Day Care is 
essential, given that p~ents whose 
children currently use the Day Cere 
Center facilities are people from a IOIN-
income baclGround <Y on part·time 
salIYies; and, 

Whereas, the Day CeYe referendum in 
1979 tllned out one of the largest 
percentages of registered students in 
any student elect ion, who voted 
overwhelmingly by 71% to 29% to retain 
Day CeYe facilities; and voted by a 63.8% 
to 36.2% to expand t~ Day Cere 
services; 

Therefore, Be It Resolved, that the 
ASUCSD Coonci I strongly recommend to 
the Registration Fee Committee: 

1. ApprOllal of the funding f<Ythe two 
CETA positions required by the UCSD 
Day CIYe Center in order to comply with 
State regulm:ions; 

2. To actively seek modes for 
exPi!nded Day Cere facili ties, includira 
necessery stllff; 

3. Rescind the vote to hold an 
additional referendum.

Roundtable: 
education 
continued from page 7 
poverty and l1l crimination 
and new s tre se upon 
familie s in our society. 

But other important root 
of the decline in achievement 
are within the re pon ibili-
ties of educator and tho e 
who e tablish public policy: 

- cutbacks in in truction 
and counseling forced upon 
schools by budget · eroded 
t hrough inflation and 
undercut by tax reductions 
and fi scal limit ; 

- the multiplication of 
function s that government 
officials expect the school to 
perform ranging from driver 
training to education about 
drugs; 

- the confusion that has 
crept into the chool 
curriculum largely through 
well -intentioned but ill-
considered substitution of 
instruction in peripheral 
ubjects for courses of more 

enduring significance: 
- our seeming inability to 

turn the bilingual capacity of 
our Hispanic and Asian 
American students to 
advantage instead of making 
it a disadvatage; and 

- the need to expand 
collaborative efforts among 
educators from elementary, 
secondary and postsecondary 
education regarding the 
content and articulation of 
instruction at the varius 
instruction at the various 
levels of schooling. 

Di sappointing levels of 
student achievement have 
s pecial implications for 
bringing a greater degree of 
justice to the distribution of 
educational opportunity in 
California. Our progress in 
bringing in to h ig her 
education student from 
underrepresented groups , 
both ethnic minorities and 
low income, is too slow. More 
must be done to remove the 
social, economic and 
psychologK.al barriers that 
keep these groups underre~ 
resented at both the 
underll'aduate and graduate 
levels.

stronger academic prepar-
ation at the junior and senior 
high school level for all 
students.

the Atlanta crisis ... 

Over twelve hundred 
signatures have been 
acquired to send an added 

messa~e to the Reagan 
Admimstration to assist the 
Atlanta investigations in any 
and every way possible. 'The 
petitions are another way in 
which the UCSD community 
and other concerned citizens 
can show support for the 

. Atlanta families, We are 
confident that this effort will 
have a meaningful impact in 
speeding up the investigative 
process_ 

Day care

continued from pale 2 
requires time, dedication and 
energy from the DCC parents 
and supporters who already 
have too little time to spare. 
Everr.0ne, regardless of 
socia, economic, religious or 
racial background, has the 
right to an education. For 
many of us, myself included, 
the existence of the UCSD 
DCC is the difference 
between continuing our 
education or not,
