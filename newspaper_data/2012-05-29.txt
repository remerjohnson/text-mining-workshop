CAMPUS LIFE

By Nicole chaN • Associate News Editor

UCSD experienced a cam-pus-wide power outage Memorial Day Weekend after a transformer 
caught fire at the east campus power 
station. According to a campus-
wide notice from the UCSD Police 
Department, the power outage from 
the electrical fire, which was reported 
Saturday at 12:18 p.m., affected the 
entire campus, including the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography and 
the university’s Thornton Medical 

Hospital. 
All six dining halls and the 

college markets closed due to 
the campus-wide power outage.  
  Goody’s Market student lead 
and Revelle College senior Sarah 
Matsushima said that the market 
closed at 1 p.m.

“The power went out at 11:45 
a.m.,” Matsushima said. “Goody’s 
upstairs was giving out food. All 
refrigeration was down, heating was 
down, all registers were down, so we 

couldn’t charge them.”
Muir College sophomore David 

Woo said that he did not experience 
the power outage until he got to cam-
pus around 8 p.m. on Saturday.

“It was eerily quiet,” Woo said. 
“None of my apartmentmates were 
home this weekend, so I called my 
friends and went out to dinner,” Woo 
said.

Although power was restored 
Sunday morning, Woo said his build-
ing as of Monday morning still does 

not have hot water.
Due to the power outage, the uni-

versity provided on-campus residents 
with two city shuttles with service 
to Costa Verde and La Jolla Village 
Square. The shuttles were avail-
able for 8:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on 
Saturday.

According to KGTV 10 News, the 
fire caused approximately $300,000 
worth in damage to the power station 
building’s contents, and approximate-
ly $50,000 in damage to the property. 

The campus-wide power outage also 
affected UCSD’s Thornton Medical 
Hospital, forcing it to utilize its emer-
gency backup power. 

Although campus-wide notices 
reported power to be restored within 
four hours, power was not restored 
campus-wide until 1:30 a.m. on 
Sunday.

Co-op 
Collective 
Rebounds 
After Debt

BY EMILY PHAM
Staff Writer

UCSD’s co-ops — Ché Café, 
General Store, the Food Co-op and 
Groundwork Books — are currently 
recovering after paying off $20,000 of 
their debts.

According to General Store mem-
ber Taury St. Claire, the co-ops suf-
fered from dwindling business due 
to construction. The construction, 
which lasted from 2007-09, expanded 
the Old Student Center from 10,000 
square feet to 15,000 square feet. It 
blocked the main entrance to the 
General Store, causing fewer custom-
ers to visit the co-ops. The lack of 
business and loss of co-op member-
ship almost caused the co-ops to be 
shut down after they accrued almost 
$45,000 of debt to vendors and to the 
university. 

“The store just looked really, real-

The four university co-
ops faced closure after     
accruing $20,000 in debt 
during 2007-09.

RADY SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT

BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor

A new five-story lecture hall 
opened in the Rady School of 
Management on Friday, May 11. The 
Rady School celebrated the opening 
of Wells Fargo Hall in a ribbon-
cutting ceremony attended by Rady 
School Dean Robert S. Sullivan, 
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, 
philanthropist Ernest Rady, Steve 
Bernstein of Wells Fargo and Rady 
School MBA student Ashley Zeeland.

The 81,000 square-feet hall holds 

a classroom for 185 students, two 
classrooms for 75 students each, 45 
faculty offices, 18 team study rooms 
and multiple multi-purpose confer-
ence rooms. The hall also includes 
the J.R. Beyster Auditorium, named 
in honor of support provided by 
Betty and Dr. J. Robert Beyster. 

According to the press release, 
construction on the $47-million 
Wells Fargo Hall began May 21, 
2010 after a $5-million challenge gift 
from Ernest Rady. This challenge gift 
showed Rady’s commitment to the 
project and “challenged” others to 
support the proposed building. This 
led to a $5-million gift from Wells 
Fargo Bank that facilitated the proj-
ect. Private donations from Rita and 
Richard Atkinson, Arthur Brody, Jan 
Tuttleman and Tony Thornley also 
supported the construction of the 

hall. 
“The opening of Wells Fargo Hall 

is a testament to the continued sup-
port of the Rady School by our com-
munity,” Rady School Dean Robert 
S. Sullivan said in a May 16 press 
release. “The new facilities will pro-
vide the Rady School with the capac-
ity to accommodate more students 
and enhance its educational and 
research programs. The Rady School 
now will have among the finest facili-
ties in the nation.”

Wells Fargo Hall also meets 
Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design standards and 
achieved silver certification for its 
water savings and energy efficiency. 

According to a press release, the 
hall will start being used this sum-
mer. The Rady School opened in 
2003 and its first building, Otterson 

Hall, opened in 2007. 
In addition to the Rady School, 

construction projects are currently 
in progress at other areas of campus. 
Construction on the Jacobs Medical 
Center Plant began last week, on May 
21. The structure, which will pro-
vide support utilities for the Jacobs 
Medical Center bell tower, will be 
completed in Fall 2014. 

The university will also wel-
come Engineering Building Unit IV 
in 2013, a four-story structure with 
office and laboratory space for 50 fac-
ulty members and 1,100 students, in 
addition to studios and design space 
for visual arts students. Government 
and private funds are supporting the 
$83.3-million project.

ly sad,” St. Claire said.
As a result, the co-ops and the 

university negotiated in 2008 to 
temporarily stop the rent until the 
co-ops could afford to pay it off. 
In the former 2006 lease, the Ché 
Café paid $84.00, the General Store 
$1,450.97, the Food Co-op $521.70 
and Groundwork Books $788.55 per 
month for rent, based on the square 
footage of each space.

“We decided as a co-op to stop the 
rent,” St. Claire said. “Every quarter 
we were scraping by and would barely 
make the rent.”

After construction at the Old 
Student Center ended, further 
improvements to the co-ops increased 
business for them. The Bike Shop 
and General Store switched locations, 
which led to more foot traffic for the 
General Store. Increased co-op mem-
bership and increased sales due to 
the addition of the co-ops’ textbook 
rental program allowed co-ops to 
start hosting Open Mic nights, video 
game tournaments, workshops and 
benefit shows on a regular basis. As 
a result, more students came and the 
co-ops recovered. 

“It was really, really rough for us 
to pull out of the hole,” Sanchez said. 
“We’re still rising up after it. However, 
we’re not struggling or on the brink 
of failure.”

Though the rent was temporar-
ily stopped, the co-ops hope that 
future negotiations with University 
Centers will allow their complexes 
to be rent-free, or at least have heav-
ily reduced rent. The co-ops’ current 
Master Space Agreement — a renew-
able two-year legal document that 
defines how each university space 
operates — considers them business-
es and does not accurately reflect the 
non-profit and co-op nature of the 
stores, according to General Store 
member Samantha Sanchez. 

“Previously, [the contract] talks 

about us as vendors,” Sanchez said. 
“We wanted to change it to co-ops 
since we’re different than other ven-
dors; we’re non-profit and all volun-
teers.”

The co-ops also want the chang-
es in the MSA to ensure they can 
continue hosting events, such as the 
Super Smash Bros. tournament they 
held on Thursday, May 24 at the 
General Store. As “vendors,” the co-
ops would have more restrictions on 
which events they can host.

“Each co-op is a unique space and 
resource, and we want to share that 
with people,” Sanchez said.

However, MSA negotiations 
between University Centers and the 
co-ops have been a slow process, 
starting from 2008 to present day, 
according to Sanchez. Sanchez said 
it took weeks for University Centers 
to talk to the university board about 
each change proposed by the co-ops. 
University Centers Director Hugh 

Hagues confirmed that University 
Centers is still considering the 
amount of debt forgiveness for the 
co-ops and that the process has been 
“on and off.”

The co-op collective hopes to 
reach a conclusion regarding the 
lease and the rest of their debt in Fall 
2012, according to co-op member 
Anya Diamond. They also hope to 
bring back community grants and 
student scholarships once they are 
out of debt, and work more closely 
with students and A.S. Council.

“We want to change our relation-
ship with the university,” Sanchez 
said.

Students who want to be involved 
with the General Store can attend 
open meetings on Fridays at 5 p.m. at 
the General Co-op, or on Thursdays 
at 8:30 p.m. at the Ché Café.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  TUESDAY, MAY 29,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU/GUARDIAN

The issue of protecting private companies from overseas cyber threats has led the United States government to 
vote on another act that patrols the sharing 
of private information on the Internet. The 
Cyber Intelligence and Sharing Protection 
Act (CISPA) is a provision on the National 
Security Act of 1947 that allows the sharing of 
Internet traffic information between the United 
States government and certain technological 
companies like AT&T, Facebook and Microsoft 
in order to boost cyber security from potential 
overseas cyber spies. CISPA is a bill that not 
only favors big businesses and violates the 
privacy of American citizens but also sets 
a dangerous precedent for future bills that 
restrict the First Amendment law that protects 
the freedom of the press.

CISPA passed in the House of 
Representatives on April 26, 2012 with the 

backing of a strong Republican majority of 
206 out of 248 votes. CISPA is the latest link 
in online privacy legislation, after SOPA, 
the Stop Online Piracy Act that restricted 
the access to certain sites that hosts pirated 
content. SOPA was introduced to the House 
of Representatives October 26, 2011 only to 
be met with controversy from government 
officials and the public alike. It has yet to come 
to an official vote due to a lack of consensus 
in the House, including opposition by Nancy 
Pelosi and Ron Paul, and public disapproval 
by major companies including Google, 
Wikipedia and Twitter.  SOPA aims to fight 
piracy within the United States while CISPA is 
attempting to strengthen cyber security from 
overseas threats. However, both bills present 
major issues of privacy infringement. Similar 
to SOPA, CISPA infringes upon the right to 
freedom of speech by limiting file sharing 

among users, while increasing file sharing 
between governments and business without 
explicit public consent.

A lack of specificity is also an issue 
in CISPA that does not seem to have a 
forthcoming response. In the bill, the 
government is able to confiscate online 
material such as emails, without judicial 
oversight, if they believe the material is a threat 
to “cyber security.” The bill states that they 
perceive a threat as “efforts to harm public 
and private systems and networks” and “theft 
or wrongful possession of public or private 
data, intellectual property, or personally 
identifiable information.” Terms like “harmful” 
do not paint a specific picture of what may be 
flagged as a threat, and therefore allows the 
government to find anything harmful without 

The Cyber Intellegence and Sharing Protection Act (CISPA) is a threat to online privacy and First 
Amendment rights due to its vague terms that grant unrestricted power for government investigations.

Not a Fair Share
I’ll keep this simple: I came, I saw and since I need another year to do what needs to be done — I’ll 
take it. 

Yes, this is my third editor in 
chief soapbox, my final statement of 
intent to spend my last year living 
by Wednesdays and Sundays. The 
aforementioned rationale is simple. 
The decision-making process was not.

I am a great believer in the faceless 
wisdom of others and so, about five 
weeks back, my Google history started 

including the following searches: 
“how to deal with burnout,” “is my 
job worth it” and, finally, straight-up, 
“should I quit my job.” Luckily, there’s 
a multitude of quizzes offering to clear 
the confusion. Do you get along with 
your boss or does he create a negative 
work environment? I get along with 
myself fairly well, yes, but I’ve been 
told that my bouts of moody silence 
are terrifying. Could you find a better 
job elsewhere? I, and all the editors, 
easily could for the upcoming year, yet 
we’re still here. Then, the kicker: Is it 
worth it?

No. It isn’t. It hasn’t been. And if 
I walk away now, all of this — power 
struggles, moving offices, production 
problems, budget changes, and big 
plans — will never have been worth 
it. It’s both terribly depressing and 
terribly meaningful to say that this, 
“this” being the ephemeral aspects 
of working here, the late nights and 
endless meetings, the panicked calls 
and angry letters, the rice pudding 
(300 calories, far too much sugar) and 
TapEx, this is closer to my bones than 
any 40-page thesis due next week that 
I haven’t started (truth). It’s closer than 
the student orgs I could have joined, 
the classes dropped because my work 
schedule was too demanding, the 
money I could have made if only my 
main job didn’t pay approximately $2 
an hour for 50+ hours a week. 

It’s been three full years since “this” 
first entered my life, two since we 
started making changes, one since the 
momentum began and, I hope, just 
one more until all my outsized dreams 
are realized. 

Last week, I talked with a friend 
about the entirely non-surprising 
insight that I am, by nature, prone to 
bitterness. If I leave, I theorized, I will 
end up bitter because of the “what 
ifs.” If I stay, I might end up bitter 
because those hopes weren’t realized, 
and I spent four years cleaning up 
after others. The practical side of the 
decision is that, given the outcome of 
bitterness either way, I’d rather earn 
it while struggling for something 
(and then blame everyone else for 
not helping, instead of myself for 
not staying). And the prettier side 
is this: The Guardian has been the 
most important endeavor I have 
ever worked on. It has brought me 
to my knees and also brought me 
(indirectly) to Nashville, D.C. and 
Israel. It has fundamentally shaped 
who I am and, in return, I want to 
fundamentally, shape its future and 
ensure its success when I’m gone.

No one can do it alone, and if I 
can make one final push, it is only

UCSD’s newly adapted holistic admissions 
process has continued to bring in some of 
the most academically qualified students, but 
ultimately, it ignores social environments and 
leaves socioeconomically disadvantaged minority 
students at a greater disadvantage.

The prior point system for admission, 
which ranked students based on a sum total 
of GPA and extracurricular activities, allotted 
additional points to students coming from 
socioeconomically disadvantaged households to 
account for the fact that not all students come 
from nurturing environments. The subjective 
holistic review process does do this. Instead, 
individual readers determine a score from 1-5 to 
give to an applicant as a whole. 

This lack of minority students after adoption 
of the holistic review process is especially visible 
in departments such as the Jacobs School 
of Engineering where there is already little 
diversity. According to data recently published 
regarding the 2012 admitted class, minority 
applicants are at an all-time high but very 
few are being admitted. Only 25 percent of 
all Chicano/Latino applicants were accepted 
into the school of engineering compared to 32 
percent in 2011. Similarly, the percent of African 
American acceptances decreased from 25 
percent to 18 percent in 2012. Overall, this has 
left the incoming class in the Jacobs School of 
Engineering more homogenous than ever. 

The adoption of the holistic review process 
has not helped increase diversity on campus, and 
it fails to recognize the importance of forming 
a well-rounded class that stems from different 
backgrounds.

QUICK TAKES IN FALL 2011, UCSD FOLLOWED UC BERKELEY AND UCLA IN USING A HOLISTIC ADMISSIONS PROCESS THAT GRANTS A SINGLE SCORE FROM 1 (RECOMMEND ADMISSION) TO 5 (RECOMMEND DENY) TO AN APPLICANT’S FILE.

This year, in selecting the class of 2015, the 
UCSD Office of Admissions replaced the point-
based admissions criteria it had used for over a 
decade with a ‘holistic review’ process in which 
candidates’ accomplishments are assessed in 
the context of the challenges they have faced. 
Though its critics consider holistic review 
liable to bias, the fact is that similar admissions 
procedures have been in place at more selective 
institutions for years.

Use of holistic review in admissions is useful 
in making distinctions between highly qualified 
candidates, making it perfect for UCSD, which 
is rapidly becoming more selective. 

It is right for UCSD and UCI to use holistic 
review because their admissions rates have 
been decreasing steadily in the last five years. 
UCSD’s admissions rate has dropped from 43 
percent to 2006 to 37 percent in 2011. In the 
same time span, UCI’s admissions rate declined 
from 61 percent to 44 percent. UC Berkeley and 
UCLA, which have used holistic review for all 
five years, have had stable admissions rates over 
the half-decade, each hovering near 25 percent.  
Highly selective private schools like Harvard 
and Yale have always used holistic review. The 
trend is clear: more selective schools need 
holistic review to choose their students.   

The point-based system works serviceably 
when nearly half of the applicant pool is 
accepted, but is less useful when it comes to 
making distinctions between higher-scored 
candidates. The UCSD Office of Admissions 
is right to adopt a procedure for selecting the 
freshman class that is befitting of the school’s 
increased selectivity.

In Fall 2011, UCSD adopted a new holistic 
admissions process for incoming freshman that 
is being pushed by UC Regents. Already in place 
at UC Berkeley and UCLA, the new process 
evaluates each applicant comprehensively and 
takes more account of the opportunities and 
struggles presented to the student during their 
high school career. However, the system is based 
off scores given by at least two readers instead 
of a point-by-point mathematical breakdown 
that can lead to too much subjectivity in the 
process of choosing students.         

UCSD’s previous admissions process, known 
as the comprehensive review process, gave 
students a review score based on academic 
achievement and extracurriculars, and then 
compared this to an overall cut-off score to 
determine the decision to admit or deny. This 
process was transparent and easy to explain to 
non-admitted students if they were to question 
their rejection. 

The new holistic process scores each 
application from 1 (emphatically recommended 
for admission) to 5 (recommend deny) as a 
whole, but the total score is not an admission’s 
decision—some students can be admitted while 
others are not even if they’re in the same score 
group, with the process not being able to be 
explained clearly to them. The vast differences 
between these two admissions processes allows 
for the bias of the reader to be the ultimate 
determining factor in whether a student is 
admitted or not. 

The new holistic process simply does not 
have the clear-cut method that the previous 
system had.

oversight. Also, items that that one 
cannot have “wrongful possession” of 
is so vast and non-specific that just 
about any information can be deemed 
stolen.  This hard-to-define threat is 
not clear enough to hand over people’s 
privacy. 

The bill states that private 
companies are under their own 
discretion of whether to share a 
user’s information or not. While 
some companies like Facebook have 
said they will not share personal 
information with government 
agencies like the National Security 
Agency and the Department of 
Homeland Security, the bill does not 
require a warrant for the information. 
The bill also absolves the government 

of liability — users cannot sue them 
for wrongful usage of information. 
Since this will be an exchange 
exclusively between the government 
and companies, users will ultimately 
be blind to the fact that their private 
information is being used to fight 
cyber threats. 

Providing a “safer” cyber network 
does not warrant undermining 
people’s privacy and civil rights. 
It is also extremely tough for the 
government to filter material on a 
daily basis. Cisco — one of the top 
multinational corporations that 
designs networking equipment — has 
projected that by 2015, one million 
minutes of video will cross global 
networks every second, and that there 
will be twice as many networked 
devices as there are people in the 

world. The benefits of confiscating 
potentially threatening online content 
do not outweigh the violation privacy 
combined with the difficulty of 
sorting through the avalanche of 
“cyber threats.”

Companies should be able to 
share anonymous information to the 
government in order to fight cyber 
attacks and allow the government to 
assess the potential threats. However, 
creating a network where the people 
are susceptible to the big companies’ 
personal interpretation on whether 
our data is “safe” or not provides little 
security and logic given the scope of 
the problem and today’s technological 
society.

We Just Need the Final Year to 
Put Everything Into Place

Dear Editor,
In his recent letter to the 

Guardian, Nikolai Smith suggests that 
Israel is a “systemic threat to peace 
and democracy in the region.” The 
reality is that Israel is, in fact, the 
region’s only bright spot for peace and 
democracy. Several respected non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) 
produce annual reports which rank 
the human rights, both civil and 
political, that each country provides 
its citizens and all of these NGOs give 
Israel the highest marks, by far, among 
the 22 countries of the Middle East 
including the territories governed by 
the Palestinian Authorities such as 
Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas and 
areas within the West Bank, where the 
Palestinian Authority governs.

The annual report of the most 
respected of these NGOs, Freedom 
House International, consistently 
designates only one Mideast country 
as providing its citizens full freedom. 
That country is Israel. Similarly, other 
NGOs such as Democracy Ranking, 
Carleton University’s Country 
Indicators for Foreign Policy, World 

Democracy Audit and others all put 
Israel far ahead of all her Muslim 
neighbors in all categories including 
gender equality, freedom of press, 
religious freedom, access to justice, 
political freedom, etc. 

In fact many of Israel’s neighbors 
including Syria, Egypt and Saudi 
Arabia populate the list of countries 
that are the greatest violators of 
human rights. Smith should stop 
to ponder what this means — that 
among the 350 million Arabs in the 
Mideast, the ones who enjoy the 
greatest freedoms are the 1.5 million 
Arabs that happen to live as citizens 
of Israel.

 No surprise then that polls of 
Israeli Arabs consistently reveal that, 
despite the challenges they face as a 
minority, an overwhelming majority 
of them would choose to continue 
living in Israel over any other Arab 
country in the region, including 
a future independent Palestinian 
state.  If he really wants to encourage 
peace and democracy in the region, 
Smith should work to encourage other 
countries in the Mideast to model 
Israel’s democratic ideals.

The Great 
Burrito Hunt 
Continues at 
Lucha Libre
I n my search for the best burrito joint within San Diego, it would be completely remiss of me not to pay 
a visit to the reigning champion of 
two years: Lucha Libre.  

This Mexican eatery has garnered 
the most attention and fame among 
many tourists and locals, evidenced 
by the line of hungry patrons that 
stretched out the door during my visit 
— an expected dilemma given the 
restaurant was featured on “Man vs. 
Food” in 2010. Yes, Adam Richman, 
king of unapologetic gluttons every-
where, was told that Lucha Libre 
could be the best representation of 
San Diego burrito culture. Of course, I 
had to see for myself.

Although “Man vs. Food” featured 
the Surfin’ California burrito, I’ve 
been told by multiple Libre enthusi-
asts that the real prize menu item was 
their version of a more classic San 
Diego staple, the Surf ‘n’ Turf bur-
rito. While waiting there for a good 
25 minutes in line, I was given ample 
time to study its description: carne 
asada steak, shrimp, avocado slices, 
rice, pico de gallo and chipotle sauce? 
Sounds like a party.

Upon receiving it a mere two 
minutes after ordering, I was not 
disappointed by first impressions. It, 
like most burritos served in America, 
was utterly huge, and even came with 
a side of freshly made tortilla chips. 
Of course, it was nothing I couldn’t 
handle, but I understood that it would 
severely push me to my limits. As a 
matter of technique I helped myself 
to the plethora of salsas available, 
ready to take on a challenge of Adam 
Richman-sized proportions.

But once I got deep into the bur-
rito, my disappointment kicked in. It 
may seem like a terribly ungrateful 
complaint, but there was simply too 
much steak. As opposed to most other 
burrito places that usually skimp on 
the meat, it was a lack of a balance 
with the other ingredients that ulti-
mately threw me off. Where was the 
avocado? Where was the rice? Where 
was the pico de gallo? It wasn’t until 
halfway down the wrap that I saw 
anything other than shrimp and steak, 
which made me grateful that I loaded 
up at the salsa bar to change up (or, at 
least add) its flavor. The steak was also 
too chewy for my taste. Although it 
was cooked down nice and pink, the 
chunks were too thick and very hard 
to bite into smaller pieces, resulting in 
what seemed like an endless cycle of 
cow-like chewing. 

Nonetheless, when I finally did get 
to the heart of the burrito, I discov-
ered why so many people loved it so 
much. The chipotle sauce, proclaimed 
to be made from Lucha Libre’s “super 
secret recipe,” was delicious and very 
flavorful, which went well with the 
lightly seasoned steak and shrimp. 
The shrimp was not overcooked, and 
I thought that using fresh avocado 
slices instead of guacamole really gave 
it beautiful color. Their fire-roasted 
salsa was copiously poured, although

The Other  
    Wrap

Veggie   pasta  

SALAD
Nichole perri 
contributing Writer

10 oz.   Penne   Pasta
1/2 cup   of   olive  oil
1/4 cup   of   grated   parmesan    cheese

1 Yellow    bell   pepper
1 orange   bell   pepper

1/3 Cup   of   cherry   tomatoes
2 teaspoons   of   garlic    pepper

dash of salt
dash of ground pepper

Boil a pot of water. Add pasta and cook for eight to 10 minutes or 
until al dente; drain. Chop up the bell pepper and the cherry toma-
toes; toss with the pasta. Next add the olive oil, garlic pepper, salt and 
ground pepper. Finally, top it with grated parmesan cheese.

The great thing about this pasta is that it’s extremely easy to make, 
with the whole process taking around 15 minutes. This dish is a per-
fect as a side dish for a barbecue or a light summer lunch. Unlike most 
pasta salads, this one is olive oil-based rather than mayonnaise-based, 
and packed with healthy vegetables. This pasta salad leaves you full and 
satisfied without the heavy feeling of mayonnaise. It can be served hot 
or cold and can be easily stored in the fridge and eaten as leftovers. 

Cheapskate  
Lime-Ade
Nichole perri 
contributing Writer

1 carton   of   generic,   frozen   
lime-ade   mix

4 3/4 cups    of    water
20 fl.   oz   of   sprite   (can   

substitute   with   champagne   if   
you   want   to  party)

Pour the frozen lime-aid mix into a pitcher. Add the four 3/4 cups of 
water. Finally add the sprite or champagne. Mix well and serve over ice.

There is just something about the lemon/lime, sweet-and-tart bal-
ance that is just so refreshing. This drink is perfect to quench your thirst 
on hot summer days. Make this drink for a barbecue or pool party 
to cool off from the hot sun. The best part is that it takes about two 
minutes to make. Unlike other lime-ades and mix drinks where you 
need to squeeze and shave lemons and limes, you already have most of 
the drink pre-made. You don’t need to be a bartender to impress your 
friends with how good and refreshing it tastes. Substitute champagne 
for the sprite you are going to a party and want an extra kick.

Mixed Berry 
Grunts
Ayan Kusari
Staff Writer

Adapted from Vegetarian Ventures

4 cups   of   berries   of   your   choice
About   half   should   be   strawberries
The   other   half    may    be    blackberries, 
blueberries     or     raspberries

2 cups     flour
2/3 cup    sugar

1 teaspoon    lemon    juice
4 teaspoon    baking    powder

1/2 teaspoon    salt
3/4 cup    unflavored    almond    milk*

3 tablespoons    Earth    Balance    butter 
spread*

Wash and chop the strawberries into fairly thick slices. Wash other 
berries, and toss all the fruit with the sugar and lemon juice. Let it sit 
for 10 minutes. In a large saucepan, combine the fruit, sugar and lemon 
juice. Let it sit for about ten minutes so that a sugar starts to form. 
Next, bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and stir it often.

While waiting for the mixture to simmer, combine the flour, baking 
soda and salt in a bowl. Next, melt the butter into milk in a tiny sauce-
pan. Add the warm mixture to the dry ingredients and stir into a thick 
dough.

Scoop heaping tablespoons full of the mixture into the simmer-
ing fruit to make dumplings. Then cover with a lid and let simmer for 
another 20 minutes. 

NOTES: Tastes incredible with a scoop of soy vanilla ice cream (or 
regular ice cream if you aren’t vegan). Can be made with 1/2 cup regu-
lar milk and 2 tablespoons regular butter instead. If a lid is unavailable, 
wrapping tightly with aluminum foil is an acceptable substitute. 

Grunts, or stovetop dumplings, are the ideal summer dessert for col-
lege students. They are what you get when you take the labor out of 
the classic two-crust pie. Practically foolproof, no rolling, kneading, 
macerating, or greasing is involved. They’re also ideal for the college 
student on a budget: there are few ingredients, and most of them are 
dirt-cheap. The most expensive ingredients are the berries, and they 
get cheaper and cheaper as we get deeper into summer. Oh, and did we 
mention that they’re delicious?

Marinated  Salmon  with 
Mango-kiwi  

Relish
Ashley Kwon
Staff Writer

Salmon 
3 Tablespoons   honey
4 teaspoons   low-sodium   soy sauce
2 teaspoons   olive    oil

1/2 tablespoon    black   pepper
2 (6   ounce)   salmon   fillet    (about   1   inch thick)

1/2 cooking   spray
Relish

1 Mango
2.5 Kiwis

1/2 cup   fresh   orange    juice

Rinse and pat dry the salmon. To prepare the salmon, combine first four 
ingredients in a small bowl and mix them well. Marinate the salmon with 
this marinade for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally.

While the fish marinates, prepare the relish. Dice and cube the peeled 
mangoes and the peeled kiwis. Combine these with the orange juice in a 
small bowl.

Heat the grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat the pan with cooking 
spray. Add fish carefully and cook about five minutes on each side. 

Serve the salmon with the relish on a plate.

As college students, we tend to eat to fill, not fuel. As a consequence, 
we easily feel bloated, lethargic and energy deprived. It’s time for some 
real food that can tantalize and excite the taste buds without making your 
esophagus feel like an oily slip and slide. Whether it be your special one or 
your friends  — or even just yourself — this healthy, easy dish will certainly 
entertain both their eyes and tongues. The honey-sweet firm and flaky 
salmon and ripe mangoes and kiwis complement each other to the point 
where a bunch of light ingredients give an end result that is juicy and rich. 
With every bite, you can’t help but think summer is right around the 
corner.

Single furnished Bedroom for the Summer 
in UTC - I’m subletting my room for the 
summer (mid-June - mid-September) since 
I won’t be in town. The lease will start on 
June 18th and will end August 31st, how-
ever, I understand that Summer Session 
2 at UCSD ends around the 2nd-week 
of Sept. so I can arrange something that 
will work out for school. Rent only cov-
ers water, sewage, and trash - SDGE and 
internet are split among housemates. The 
bedroom is located in a 3 bedroom and 1.5 
bathroom townhouse. The house is 5-10 
mins walk to the 2nd-stop Arriba shutte 
and other bus stops. The room is fully 
furnished: Queen-sized bed, nightstand, 
and lamp (I will be moving my desk and 
chair back home, but I do have a folding 
table and chair which a new tenant can 
use if needed). Currently, there is only one 
female housemate residing in one of the 
bedrooms. She is a 3rd-year pharmacy stu-
dent who will be busy this summer doing 
rotations. She’s studious and likes to keep 
to herself.  Feel free to contact me via email 
for more information. Thanks! Reply online

Looking for a single room for the school 
year - Hello, my name is Savinna and I am a 
Senior in Revelle College. I am looking for a 
place to stay for the Fall 2012-Spring 2013 
school year (this means that I would like to 
move in in SEPTEMBER). I would prefer a 
single room but don’t mind a shared rest-
room and am not gender picky so long as 
you’re a nice, respectful person. I’m really 
laid back and don’t mind partying (I would 
prefer if you did it on the weekends, but 
so long as I have advance notice, it’s fair 
game). I don’t mind if you have friends over 
or if you drink so long as it’s done respon-
sibly. I would prefer non-smoking. I don’t 
mind messes so long as the common areas 
are overall relatively clean. A little about 
myself: I am usually tidy and clean up after 
myself. I have a fairly busy schedule since I 
work on campus so I’m usually out. I am a 
night owl so I usually stay up late to study. 
I love baking and cooking so don’t be sur-
prised if I continuously offer you cupcakes 
or other desserts. I have a cute little dwarf 
hamster that I would like to bring with me 
(I change her cage weekly so she doesn’t 
smell and she doesn’t make a lot of noise), 
but if you don’t want pets I can keep her at 
home. I am quiet and keep to myself most 
of the time, but that does not mean that 
I am antisocial or unfriendly. I would like 
to spend about $650 plus the amount for 
utilities (but I am willing to negotiate price 
if you are interested). I would like a loca-
tion that’s near a shuttle and/or bus stops 
since I won’t have a car and heavily rely 
on public transportation. Any apartments 
with parking spaces are also a plus since if 
it’s too far away, I can bring my car. Please 
let me know if you are at all interested or 
if you have any questions. I generally con-
sider myself friendly and down to Earth so 
please don’t be shy :) Reply online to listing

ested, please contact me at since I check 
that email more often. Females preferred!

they offered many winning varieties 
at their bar, including one of the best 
pico de gallos I’ve had in a while. The 
rice was also very good, even though 
it was mostly located at the very end. 
Perhaps I just started at the wrong end 
of the wrap.

All in all, it cannot be denied that 
Lucha Libre definitely makes a killer 
burrito, but it definitely didn’t live up 
to my expectations. The Surf ‘n’ Turf, 
albeit a pretty delicious specimen, has 
a few kinks to work out before I can 
say it surpasses my experience at Don 
Carlos. But, at $7.25, it’s definitely 
worth its weight in gold. The atmo-
sphere is friendly and the décor fun. 
I suggest it to anyone who is willing 
to make the trek; I’m sure you’ll leave 
full and satisfied.

F or a 50-minute event, A Taste of UCSD has an ambitious goal: to introduce its audience 
to all the groundbreaking research, 
innovative thought and 
— here’s the clincher 
— food that has come 
out of the university in 
the last decade or so.

The Thursday eve-
ning event is split into 
25 minutes of learning 
and 25 minutes of tast-
ing. Learning comes first at A Taste 
of UCSD: five top faculty members 
will give five-minute talks about 
their research. The food that fol-
lows comes with a twist: All of it is 
provided by former UCSD students 
who have found success in the food 
industry.

The topics of the talks range 

from heart disease to foreign trade 
to nanomaterials and even classical 
singing. There are no powerpoints, 
and nobody will be taking notes.

The food is no less 
enticing. San Diego Sushi 
Ninjas will provide a main 
course. The Secret Cookie 
Service guy will have a 
selection of his offerings 
for dessert. And Chuao 
Chocolate — founded by 
UCSD Alumni Michael 

and Richard Antonorsi in 2002 — 
will put on a chocolate tasting to 
finish the meal.

The event is a part of 
Alumni Weekend 2012, but 
current UCSD students are 
allowed to attend. Tickets are 
$10, but include the price of 
food. Register now at http://

T he annual student-run ADDO Art Festival — UCSD’s largest art exposi-
tion — begins today. 
This three-day festival, 
which takes place 
from May 29 to May 
31, gives all students, 
staff and faculty the 
opportunity to show-
case their works of 
art in free gallery and 
performance spaces.

It’s also a chance for artists and 
visitors alike to score some free 
food, not to mention free network-
ing. If you’re an artist yourself, you 
might just find yourself striking 

a conversation with a future col-
laborator. 

The festival will be open for 
browsing from 5 p.m. to 11 
p.m. each day in the Price 
Center East Ballroom — 
ending with a “wrap party” 
on the last day. Original 
artwork of all kinds — live 
performances, installa-
tions, gallery work, portfo-
lios and more — by UCSD 
artists from all disciplines 

and academic levels will be pre-
sented throughout the space. The 
Museum of Contemporary Art San 
Diego, ArtPwr, Calit2, San Diego 
Asian Film Foundation and Triton 

TV are also expected to participate. 
In addition, there’ll be a discus-

sion panel held on May 30 at 7 
p.m. featuring various faculty and 
staff members from the Music, 
Visual Arts and Theatre and Dance 
Department.

By bringing together UCSD’s 
diverse art community, ADDO cre-
ates a cross-disciplinary social net-
work while displaying an array of 
art forms through different medi-
ums in one giant exhibition.

like the University of Oregon. They 
simply get the very best athletes from 
wherever they are located and make 
them superstars. Regardless of their 
country of origin, they know taking 
the very best athletes and putting them 
in their system will create PAC12 and 
national championship teams as well as 
Olympic athletes. Rather than taking 
foreigners to temporarily fill holes in 
their program, they take them because 
they have a complete program.

And that brings us back to UCSD. 
Yes, the fact that we do not have much 
money is a factor, but at the heart of 
our department is the knowledge that 
we can create complete programs, to 
build teams that will win CCAA and 
NCAA championships. While other 
programs have perennially out-spent 
UCSD, the Tritons are still able to stay 
on top of the CCAA and have the right 
system in place to win at any level.

New Coach Comes in With Olympic and Professional Experience
Washington — where she led the 
squad to back-to-back conference 
tournament �nals — Vanderveer 
took a position as head coach of the 
newly formed WNBA Sacramento 
Monarchs. She spent the next 10 
seasons as an assistant for the Min-
nesota Lynx and as a WNBA scout. 

Vanderveer returned to colle-
giate coaching in 2007 as the asso-
ciate head coach at San Diego State 
before landing the head coaching 

position at Occidental in 2009. 
Vanderveer — whose older sister 

Tara Vanderveer is the head coach at 
Stanford — has also spent time as a 
scout for the 2008 women’s national 
team that won gold in Beijing. 

“I’ve enjoyed a tremendous va-
riety of experience in basketball,” 
Vanderveer said. “I’ve learned a 
great deal from some tremendous 
basketball minds and tremendous 
people.” 

In 2013, Vanderveer will be 

tasked with rebuilding a squad that 
has lost three of its principal players 
in graduating seniors: guard Daisy 
Feder, forward Lauren Freidenberg 
and All-American Chelsea Carlisle. 
�e three led 2012s women’s bas-
ketball team to the longest winning 
streak in school history, a regular 
season title as well as an appearance 
in the West Region Finals.

“Every year’s a new year,” 
Vanderveer said. “Obviously los-
ing such a talented trio of players 

is challenging, but where there are 
challenges there are also opportuni-
ties for younger players.”

UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Edwards feels con�dent that 
Vanderveer’s experience fully quali-
�es her to head the Tritons in 2013.

“We are extremely pleased to 
have a coach of Heidi VanDerveer’s 
caliber joining the Triton family,” 
Edwards said to the UCSD Ath-
letics Department. “She has had a 
great deal of success at several dif-

ferent levels of the sport and has 
consistently been able to recruit 
student-athletes with high academic 
standards at Occidental. We look 
forward to building on the recent 
success of the program and we feel 
that Heidi is the right person to con-
tinue that path.”

Vanderveer is in the process of 
hiring a sta� of assistant coaches.

Six Tritons Earn All-American Honors in Colorado
throws over the 230’ mark, Howe’s 
throw was still good enough for him 
to finish fifth.

“My first three throws were 
extremely weak.” Howe said. “It was 
like instead of the green light my 
body, was on the cautious yellow. 
The wind was blowing in excess of 
40 miles per hour and the javelin 
was slapping me in the face as I ran 
down the runway so I was pretty 
distracted. [In the finals] I tried to 
step on the gas and really make up 
for throwing so poorly in my first 
series but I just couldn’t reign in my 
focus and it cost me dearly.”

For the women, the 4x400m relay 
team, made up of senior Jackie Rose, 
junior Deyna Roberson, sophomore 
Lauren Irish and freshman Sabrina 
Pimentel placed seventh overall 
with a 3:45.17 time.

Rose went on to finish fourth in 
the 400m with a 54.14 second time.

“This is really what I came here 
to do,” Rose said. “In the beginning 
of the year, we all sat down and 
wrote down our goals on these 
little flash cards. This season mine 
were to qualify for NCAA’s in the 

open 400m and win the 400m at 
CCAAs. The fact that I not only 
qualified but made it to nationals 
and finished fourth is more than I 
could have imagined was possible at 
the beginning of the year.”

Junior javelin thrower Jessica 
Miklaski came into the meet ranked 
17th and finished with a throw of 
142’4”—a seasonal best after tearing 
the glenoid ligament in her shoulder 
— to take 10th place.

“It was great just to make it to 
NCAAs this year after everything 
that’s happened.” Said Miklaski who 
tore the labrum in her shoulder 
while lifting weights with the team, 
just before the season started. “It 
was hard to come back after that, 
and I struggled a lot early in the 
season, and then I got in a car 
accident that shook me up some 
more, so its really a blessing to have 
performed as well as I did to get 
here. I wish I could have done more, 
but I have to be happy with where I 
finished as I hit the best throw I’ve 
had all season here.”

Home and 
Abroad: 
Foreigners in 
the NCAA
If you go to a National Championship event put on by the NCAA, one thing you might 
not notice is the sheer number of 
international athletes.

In the past -few years, the Jamaican 

and Trinidadian semi-professional 
relay teams have gone one-two in 
the Division II NCAA Nationals 
while representing different schools. 
Similarly, the second-place finisher in 
the javelin this year was from Canada, 
representing Alaska Anchorage, a 
school that regularly recruits distance 
runners from Nigeria. 

International recruitment is not 
limited to track and field at the Division 
II level. Distance runners from Africa 
and throwers from northern Europe 
routinely go to Division I schools on a 
full scholarship with the added benefit 
on the coach’s side of an easy win 
in that athlete’s event. Swimmers and 
baseball players from South America 
are commonly found in collegiate 
competition, as well as basketball 
players from eastern Europe. Yes, these 
are sweeping generalizations, but the 
extent to which they are true has really 
surprised me through the years.

The question then comes down to 
this: Why would a coach not go get 
the very best athletes from around the 
world?

The first answer, of course would 
be money. Not every university has the 
means to recruit internationally, and 
some programs — like the program 
here at UCSD — just don’t have 
enough scholarship money to attract 
these athletes. 

Then there is the time commitment. 
Being a coach while recruiting athletes 
is like being a salesman. You have 
to sell your school to these athletes 
and close the deal, which takes time, 
finesse and money. The more time 
you spend on a good recruit, the more 
invested you are. If that falls through, 
you wasted time you could have used 
pursuing a domestic athlete that was 
not as good, but has potential. The 
risk is too high for many coaches who 
would otherwise like to have that big 
fish foreigner.

Finally, the moral side of 
international recruitment comes into 
play. Certainly, every coach wants to 
win, but at what cost? For every athlete 
that a head coach recruits from outside 
the U.S., that coach loses an ounce of 
credibility. In the scheme of things, 
that coach is stating that their program 
cannot take a “good” athlete and put 
him on the same level as that “great” 
foreign athlete. 

For some coaches, this is not a 
problem. A team headed by a distance-
oriented coach or athletic director is 
not going to be as morally conflicted by 
the prospect of adding a great foreign 
thrower to boost the team from last to 
first in the discus or shotput, because 
they might not have the resources to 
successfully build a portion of their 
program.

On the other side of the same 
coin, there are top-tier level programs

TRITONS FINISH 
2012 SEASON

Vanderveer Named New Women’s Head Coach
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor 

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — It was 
announced last Friday, May 25 that 
former Occidental College head 
coach Heidi Vanderveer will take 
over as the UCSD women’s head 
basketball coach for the 2013 sea-
son.

Vanderveer will replace former 
UCSD head coach Charity Elliott, 
who accepted an o�er to coach at 
Division I Loyola Marymount this 
April.

“I’m very excited about the 
opportunity,” Vanderveer said. 
“�ey’ve built up quite a tradition of 

excellence, and I just want to build 
upon that. I’m excited to get to San 
Diego and start working with the 
women on our team.”

Vanderveer began her coaching 
career as an assistant for Pat Sum-
mitt at the University of Tennessee, 
during which the Lady Volunteers 
advanced to the Final Four back in 
1988. 

Vanderveer then spent six sea-
sons as an assistant at the University 
of South Carolina, before she was 
named the head coach at Eastern 
Washington University. 

A�er three seasons at Eastern

Last weekend, May 24-26, seven Tritons from the men’s and women’s track teams 
advanced to the Division II NCAA 
National Championships.

The Tritons collectively 
competed in six events — the men 
placed 18th overall and the women 
finished in 31st. Six of UCSD’s seven 
competitors garnered All-American 

honors for finishing within the top 
eight in their respective fields.

“Overall, it was great meet for 
us,” UCSD men’s head coach Tony 
Salerno said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “When you can get to 
Nationals with a small group and 
come back with two school records 
and several All-Americans, you 
know you’ve had a successful trip. 
We couldn’t be more pleased with 
our athletes and how they continue 
to rise to the occasion in big meets.” 

On the men’s side, senior triple 
jumper Ka Wai Ng posted the 
highlight of the meet for the Tritons. 
The Hong Kong national came into 
the meet seeded sixth, with his best 
jump at 50’5.5.” 

Landing a new school record, a 
51’.9” jump, to lead the field through 
the first four rounds, Ng just missed 
first place, falling to Texas A&M-
Kingsville’s CJ Criggs by a single 
centimeter.

The only other Triton to qualify 

for Nationals on the men’s side was 
senior track captain Nick Howe. 

Howe — the 2010 and 2011 
national champion in the javelin 
—came into the meet with the first-
seed. In the first day of competition, 
Howe’s best mark measured at 
223’11”, far below his personal best 
of 231’3.”

In a remarkably strong field,
