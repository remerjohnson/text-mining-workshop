UCSD Vote 
Turnout 
Normal for 
Colleges 

By J eff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

Are students at UCSD 
apathetic? 

Well, compared to other 
colleges, the answer is maybe. 

One-quarter of the students 
voted in the AS elections this 
year and 30% two years ago. 

A survey of 12 California 
colleges shows that UCSD has a 
higher student government 
election turnout than most 
other UC schools, a lower 
tu rnout than most of the private 
schools surveyed and a higher 
tu rnout than the schools 
surveyed in the state college 
system. 

Private schools, generally 
smaller than public schools, get 
higher turnouts because, 
according to the elections 
commissioner at Occidental 
Co llege in Los Angeles , 
"everybody know everybody 
else." 

Private schools also seem to 
be more innovative in the way 
they approach voting. At USC, 
students vote according to their 
place of residence, or, for 
graduate students, department 
of study. Thirty-seven percent 
voted in the last election there. 

Statistics are kept separately 
for each living area at USC, the 
only college to do so. 
Fraternities (25%), commuter 
students (only 15%) and dorm 
students (28%) all turn out 
significantly below the campus 
average of 37% . Independents 
turned out at a rate of 36%, but 
one-half of all graduate 
students voted. 

Any disproportionate voice 
graduate students have, 
however, is eliminated by the 
system of government, which 
ca lls for the election of 
representatives by district. 
These repr.esentatives then 
vote as a body for executive 
offices. 

Occidental requires a 50% 
turn out to validate its 
elections, so the polls are kept 
open until that figure is 
achieved, usually three days, 
according to the elections 
commissioner. 

At usn, the elections turnout 
of 35% is attributed to a .. highly 
visible" campaign this year 
which included the student 
newspaper editor, a member of 
the executive council, and a 
house advisor. The editor won, 
but has not yet rei i nquished his 
position on the paper. 

Stanford is an exception to 
the turnout rule for private 
colleges. The elections 
commissioner there attributes 
the lower turnout to Stanford's 
size (14,000) and the "low 
ima,e of the student ,overn-
ment," a complaint common to 
most campuses surveyed. 
However. the school baa had

Rally Ends In 
Saltinan.'s Office 
Wright, Tenure Issue Draw 200 

By John Klock 
Senior Staff Writer 

A ra lly designed to support 
applications for tenure by four 
profes or ended Wednesday 
with a march to the Chan-
cellor's complex and a tense 
a nd a ngry co nfrontation 
between protestor and 

cade mic Affairs Vice-
ChancelIor Paul Saltman. 

The confrontation followed 
the rally on the gym steps 
during which almost 200 people 
heard five speak~rs including 
Dr. Will Wright, a former 
UCSD sociolOgy professor who 
wa denied tenure last year. 
Wright told the crowd that the 
most crucial aspect of the 
tenure issue is "control over 
your (the students') own 
education. " 

Tenure for Bud Mehan, a 
sociology professor, and Mike

AS Results Reexamined 
Ortega in Runoff; Toggenburger May Be Ineligible 
Marcos Ortega and Terrill 

Chafin will have to face each 
other in a run -off for 
programmin commissioner 
and Jane Toggenburger is 
eligible until at least 10 this 
morning, to serve in the student 
welfare commissioner 's 
position to which she was 
elected last week, the AS 
Judicial Board ruled last night. 

The Board decided that the 
elections commission had 
exercised .. arbitrary and 
inconsistent" standards when 
it decided earlier this week to 
disqualify " joke" run-off votes 
in the Ortega-Chafin race, thus 
giving Ortega the required 50 

percent of all votes cast. 
The Board c ited the 

commission's failure to 
disqualify joke ballots in other 
races as a major factor in its 
decision to over-rule the 
commission and require a run-
off. 

I n addition. the Board wanted 
a "consistent" base for its 
rulings on the Ortega-Chafin 
and Toggenburger-Jon Bekken 
races. 

If Toggenburger is dis-
qualifed, Bekken would be 
placed in the run-off bailor with 
only write-in op!>Onents, the 
Board and Student Organ-
izations advisor Randy 

Woodard said. Bekken and 
Chafin argued that if ineligible 
candidate ballots were 
disallowed in Ortega-Chafin 
race. then votes for Toggen-
burger would have to be 
similarly disallowed and 
Bekken declared the outright 
winner. 

Toggenburger has until 10 
this morning to prove that her 
grade average is at least 2.0. as 
required by the AS. 

According to Woodard , her 
GPA tood at just below two at 
the end of winter quarter, with 
a "No Record" still to be made 
up. If she gets at least a " B"

student unrest of the sixties and 
came out of student demands at 
UCSD to provide education 
from a minority perspective. 

The last speaker, AS 
Commissioner of Student 
Welfare Barry Hyman, read a 
Ii t of five "demands" and 
asked the crowd to accompany 
him to Saltman's office to 
present the " demands" to 
Saltman. 

Forty-five students followed 
Hyman to meet with Saitman 
for about half an hour , 
questioning and attacking him 
about his role in the tenure 
process and other mechanism 
affecting research and 
education at UCSD. 

The five points were : 
--we demand more people of 

color and more women to be 
given tenure. 

--w hy have no Chicano 
a ppointment been given 
tenure? 

--we demand that professor 
Bud Mehan and Mike Real be 
given tenure. 

--we demand that history 
professors Emory Tolbert and 
Robert Edelman be given 
tenure. 

-- we demand student 
participation with voting rights 
on all Academic Senate 
Committees. 

Saitman refused to address 
the demands, describing them 
as irrational. He did discuss, 
though, student representation 
and opinion as part of the 
tenure process.

the students who leave UCSD 
continue their education at 
another school. Over two-thirds 
of those students transfer to 
either another UC campus or to 
a california state university or 
colle e. 

While information on 
students who leave the UC 
system is not yet available, 
UCSD has recently begun to 
conduct surveys on those who 
apply for Inter-Campus 
Transfers (ICT's). 

Three hundred and twenty-
two students applied for 
intercampus transfers during 
the past fall quarter , 
com'prising 4% of the total 
undergraduate population. 

Over a third of those students 
applied to transfer to Berkeley. 
Accordin, to Starkey, UCSD 
loses a net two percent of its 
students over an avera,e of 
seven quarters throu,h lel"s 
while Berkeley gains 1% . 

A preliminar stud of I~"s

advising offices last fall 
attempted to draw some 
tentative conclusions as to the 
causes of the exodus from this 
campus. 

Academics at UCSD

students leave UCSD primarily 
for academic reasons. Of the

Rhodesian Whites 
Still In Control 
Elections Don't Give Country 
To Blacks But Guerrillas Might 

By Reginald Major 
Pacific News Service 

The one-white tWl>-vote system in Rhodesia has elected 28 
whites and 72 blacks to a Parliament, and also selected Bishop 
Abel Muzorewa as the first black Prime Minister in what is to be 
renamed Zimbabwe-Rhodesia . 

Rhodesia's whites-only vote selected the bloc of 28 white 
members of Parliament who, voting together, can veto any law 
that is proposed and supported by the black majority. Thewhite 
bloc will also control the country's army, police and courts. 
Whites tben joined their black fellow citizens in the selectionlOf 
black resentatives . 
(Reginald Major, author of several books on Black 
De Palltlr ... I. A 8laclr Cat, is a Black journalist who travels 

While nearly half the white population of 230,000 voted in the 
elections, only l.8 ·million o( Rhodesia's 6.7 million blacks (64 
percent of the black eligible voters) cast votes. The elections 
were held while more than 90 percent of the country is under 
martial law, One out of seven blacks live in heavily patrolled 
"protected hamlets" where villagers are corralled behind high 
wire fences for 22 hours a day. 

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the elections is that 
the results will affect no more than 50 percent of the Rhodesian 
land area. 

According to Justin Nyoka, a 44-year-old BBC correspondent 
who has been a reporter in his native Rhodesia since 1963, the 
Patriotic Front guerrillas clearly control 50 percent of the 
country. Another 30 percent is contested territory into which 
the Smith regime still sends ground troops. 

The Patriotic Front, consisting of the Zimbabwe African 
National Union (ZANU) , and the Zimbabwe African People's 
Union (ZAPU), officially claims "85 percent of rural 
Zimbabwe, 10 percent of urban areas and 15 percent of 
European-owned lands," according to ZANU United Nations 
representative Edson Shiriburu. 

Nyoka recently spent three montbs in areas where there is a 
concentration of protected hamlets. In an interview in San 
Francisco, he said that the territory· outside the fences is 
controlled by the Patriotic Front. 

He walked hundreds of miles, tracing and retracing his route 
over tbe eastern half of Rhodesia, north to the Zambian border, 
south to the area where Soutb African troops are operating, and 
east to the tribal trust lands that border Mozambique. 

Nyoka saw enough ofthe country, he said, to convince himself 
that ZANU forces no longer operate from Mozambique, but are 
all stationed inside Rhodesia . At one point, he said, he walked 
through a section of ZANU-controlled territory in daylight in 
the company of a heavily-armed column of more than 170 men . 

A ZANU administrative network has replaced Salisbury rule 
in such areas, the journalist said. Taxes are collected by ZANU 
appointees instead of Smith's civil service. 

Some white farmers within these areas continue to farm, he 
said, choosing to avoid tbe conflict. At one ZANU meeting he 
met two white farmers -who were members of the party. Nyoka 
claimed it is not unusual for guerrillas to set up camp on a 
farmer's territory, herding cattle for food and hanging their 
clothing on lines to dry. 

However, so many farmers are among the 2,000 whites who 
leave Rhodesia each month tbat Rhodesian parliament 
member Henry Elsworth predicts tbat 80 percent of them will 
be gone within four years if the trend continues. 

Of tbe two groups that compose the Patriotic Front, ZANU 
and ZAPU, it is ZANU that controls tbe territory and does most 
of the fighting, Nyoka said, confirming otber reports. 

ZANU is composed mainly of Moshona tribesmen, while 
ZAPU forces are Matabele. The two groups have managed to 
maintain a united front In negotiations with the West, but 
otherwise

says that if the paper gave 
negative coverage to the 
campaign , the candidates 
deserved it. " We weren ' t 
nearly aggressive enough in 
getting Morehous," Cameron 
says. 

Ca meron attributes the 
turnout, the second highest in ' 
ten years at UCLA, to a highly 
visible, hard fought campaign 
between Morehous a nd a 
fraternity candidate. 

This year, despite threatened 
lawsuits involving the 
constitutionality of the election 
codes, officials expect a turnout 
only slightly lower than last

UC Santa Barbara, which 
also had one of its highest

attributes its voter response to 
a question on the ballot asking 
for maintenance of bus service.

yes terday a t high noon. 

Two courses (2.75 and 5 miles) were run, with prize awa rded to those 
fi ni shing fastest to their predicted times. On the s hort course Ellen Glucksman 
fini shed within 30 seconds of her prediction to win first prize, followed by J unet

Badminton Over; No League Defeats

Coed Squad Buries Claremont, 12-3, After 
6 Defaults; Depth Credited for Success 

By Slan Honda 
The Triton badminton team closed out 

an undefeated league season Tuesday 
night by beating Claremont, 12-3. 

The coed squad recorded their sixth 
straight league victory with no losses and 
eighth win overall. Two non-league 
defeats came against Grossmont College 
and a much tougher Division I school, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. 

UCSD sta rted the match against 
Claremont by running up six points (of a 
possible 15) without even playing a game. 
Because only fiv e pl a yers from 
Claremont were present, they had to 
default six matches. Teams consist of 
eight people and -the visitors almost 
forfeited the match. 

When play got under way, Mark 
Standlee and Lan Ta of UCSD scored an 
impressive victory in number one mixed 
doubles by beating Danny Ruben and 
Margie Siegel. The Triton duo scored 15-8 
and 15-11 game wins to claim the victory. 

For Ruben, it was on6 of his few losses 
of the year. Ruben has been nationally 
ranked in his age group and. " does not 
lose often," said UCSD coach David 
Briggs . 

One time Ruben did not lose was 
against John Cox , The Claremont ace 
took his singles set, 15-9, 15-LO_ 

In the other men 's singles match , 
UCSD'sCraigTumer took the first game, 
15-8 and won the second by default. 

Lan Ta lead a strong showing by the 
Tritons women by beating Cindy Woo, H-
2, 11-5. Linda Fried and Cindy King also, 
swept their matches, losing only five 
points between them. 

Fried teamed with Turner in the 
second mixed doubles lind was defeuted 
two games to one by Joe Goh and Woo. 

The key to UCSD 's remarkable success 
is depth of the players, head coach Mike 
Vander Griend believes. 

" Everyone is good on the team," said 
Vand er Griend during the match 
Tuesday. " We a re strong in both the men 
and the women ." 

In contrast to many teams where there 
is one or two top players, the Tritons, said 
Vander Griend, .. are very good down to 
the number four player . We' re tough in 
all areas." 

Too coach also points to the support of 
the athletic department in helping the 
tea m. 

" Badminton is a n expensive sport," he 
said. " Each bird costs a dollar and you 
hit one once - a nd it's gone ." 

The next match for the Tritons is the 
AII-Ca I to be held at U CSD May 11-12 . Two 
other teams will be competing~ UC Davi s 
and UC Berkeley.

City Crew Championships Organized 

Equal to 3 Competitors 
By Cindy Biondi 

Four San Diego area crew 
teams, including UCSD, take to 
the waters this weekend in the 
First Annual San Diego City 
Championships. 

Coach Jack Vallerga looks 
forward to good results in all 
events. The fifth year coach 
expects the strongest boat to be 
the Lightweight Men's Four 
and sees the other races as 
being " pretty tight. This will be 
an important race Cor the 
women 's teams, " he continued. 

"There has been a lot of inter-
team competition this week to 
get the best Novice Eight, " 
acco rding to one team 
member, who added that the 
Tritons were looking for " a lot 
oC power in this race." 

With the combined efforts of 
the coaches of SDSU and USD, 
Vallerga planned the regatta 
for the local teams becau e, 
"we wanted something just for 
us." 

Triton's seven-week season, 
whi.ch began in April with the 
Crew Classic at Mission Bay. 
The season will wind up with 
the Western Sprints a nd the 
Western Intercollegiat e 
Championships in Los Gatos in 
two weeks . Vallerga called 
these events " the largest 
annual regattas on the West 
Coast." 

The teams' standi ngs are 
largely determined by their 
successes in these two events. 

Outlook 
(Continued from page 7) 

The NAJA Independent 
Tennis Tourney, an important 
stepping stone for selection of 
individuals that will compete in 
tbe · NAIA National Tourna-
ment, is on the schedule for the 
men ' s tennis team this 
weekend. 

The Cinco de Mayo Soccer 
Tournament, featuring six 
UCSD teams, is being held all 
weekend at tbe Warren College 
Fields. 

Linda Paul drills a line shot to len field during a 7-3 loss to Cal Baptist on Monday afternoon. The 
squad travels to Dominguez Hilla for a Friday afternoon game_ ""'0 '''' Sf ... Ho ... 

This was the first year this 
was possible because it marks 
only the second year of USD's 
crew team and is the first year 
that SDSU has competed with a 
men's team. Also to be included 
in the championship is the 
Mission Bay Rowing Asso-
ciation. 

Three UCSD 1M teams, "Too 
Much Sets" (volleyball), "Loi's 
Line Drivers" (softball), and 
"The Cartwrlghts" (inner tube 
water polo) will compete in tbe

Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican 
independence holiday , is being 
celebrated today at UCSD, a nd 
the festivities will include a 
mariachi band, Mexican folk 
dancing, speakers on the theme 
of the holiday and a free da nce. 

This year's Cinco de Mayo is 
the 117th anniversary of the 
Battle of Puebla , a battle fought 
between the French army 
under Count De Laurenz and 
the Mexican army, De Laurenz 
had gone to conquer Mexico for

on that make-up , she could push 
her average a bove 2.0 , 
Woodard says . Then, thE; 
Judicial Board will meet again 
and decide whether she should 
be disqua lified because her 
ave rage was below 2.0 when 
she filed _ 

Toggenburger says she took a 
test Wednesday to make up the 
"No Record", but will not know 

the results until tomorrow 
morning. 

The Judicial Board's debate 
centered on whether Toggen-
burger knew her GPA while a 
candidate. Woodard told the 
Board that "we do not assume 
the students know their 
GPA's," adding that the 
elections commission didn 't 
request GPA's of candidates 
until one week before the 

election, and didn 't require 
that list until the afternoon fo 
the second day of the election, 
too late to remove anyone from 
the ballot. 

By that time, AS Elections 
Commissioner Phil Ganezer 
had decided not to release 
candidates' G.PA ' s . Later, 
pressured by Woodard the 
morning after the election, he 
decided to do so. 

In its decision, the Board 
ca lled the Commission's 
handling of the grade average 
problem&, which also affect a 
Third College race, a "gross 
error ... 

The Board also held off 
removing Toggenburger from 
the ballot because they weren't 
certain of the reason for her 
abse nce from last night 's 
meeting.

army under General Ignacio 
Zaragoza _ 

De Laurenz's army and 
Zaragoza's army met in battle 
on May 5, 1862, at the Fort of 
Laredo y Guadalupe in Puebla, 
Mexico. Although the Mexican 
army's victory in this battle did 
not drive out the French from 
Mexico, "it showed that the 
French could be defeated by the 
Mexicans, said Mike Estrada, 
a Third College student. "This 
was the decisive battle which 
eventually led to the French 
being expelled from Mexico," 
he said. 

MEChA has planned the 
acti vities for the Ci nco de Mayo 
celebration, which will take 
place in front of the Gym. 

Beginning at noon, MEChA 
will be serving food for $2 a

sUlle.ted. "Wben depart-
ments realized we wouldn't be 

. that big," Reynolds stated, 
"they focuaed on specialized 
areas In each department." 

"Many people are not aware 
that our departments thEOre-
tically are not supposed to 

duplicate those at our sister 
schools," Reynolds continued. 
"This is why, for example, our 
psych. department focuses on 
experimental rather tban 
clinical psychology." 

Reynolds also said students 
"aren't fully informed when 
they come here." This occurs 
because the right kind of 
information isn't getting out to 
freshmen before they enter and 
because "students don't 
investigate their college Career 
thoroughly enough. " 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Ricbard Armitage 
stated that if students want to 
transfer out of UCSD, "It may 
not be beeause we faUed, but 
beeaule we succeeded. " He 
explained that the university 
should force people to question 
their education. If a student 
decide. upon a major not 
offered at UCSD, hit decision to 
tran.fer indicates the uni-
versity's "success," said 
Armitage. 

The ICT report indicates that 
social reasons for leaving 
UCsD fall bebind academic 
ones. Only 13 percent of the 
surveyed students responded 
that they did not feel they 
"belonged" to the college 
community. 

But according to a UCSD 
, alumni study cond.ucted last 

summer by the planning office, 
many alumni felt that "UCSD 
aid not meet their non-
academic expectations." 

Brown stated, "Because of 
the large classes at UCSD you 
don't meet anyone." She added, 
"Althoulh tbere are 30,000 
people atState,I've neverhada 
class biller than 35." 

A Revelle Council of 
Provosts' Report cites a 
"lonely crowd phenomenon at 
UCSD." Dale Hunter, a UC 
Berkeley transfer student, 
said, "The whole atmospbere 
at UCSD was depressing and 
aUenaling." 

Armitage commented, 
however, that "many students

that many UCSD students come 
here for intensive studying 
purposes. 

Reynolds noted that UCSD 
does not have a central meeting 
place where "people can get 
together. talk and hopefully 
alleviate some of the academic 
pressure." One former UCSD 
student added, "There is just on 
place to hang out at UCSD." 

Mort also cited financial 
reasons for students trans-
ferring out. UCSD students 
from tbe L A area especially 
return borne to save on resident 
hall fees, according to Mort. 

"In the 1960s." said Mort, 
"there W88 a trend in the UC 
system to transfer out ofthebig 
campuses like Berkeley and 
UCLA into smaller schools like 
UCSD." This trend, whlcb Mort 
attributes to tbe decade's 
turmoil, has reversed and 
students now tend to transfer 
from smaller schools to larger 
campuses.

Those Transferring in 
By Tobias Raymond 

S&aff Wrller 
While the loss of students 

becomes a growing concern at 
UCSD, increasing attention is 
being focused upon the interests, 
needs and concerns of students 
who transfer here , from other 
colleges or universities. 

Approximately .1,100 new 
advanced standing students were 
enrolled in classes here the past 
year according to Robert Starkey, 
analytical studies officer. 

Most transfers are lured here by 
the university's reputation for 
academic excellence and fine 
weather, according to Revelle 
College Dean Ernie Mort. 

Bob Kulacz, a freshman 
transfer from Cortland State 
Universiiy in New York, said, "I 
figured UCSD had a reputation on 
par with many private schools 

which cost much more; I decided 
it would be worth the cost. " 

"UCSD offered more variety," 
said Liz Ryan, a transfer from 
Virginia's Sweet Briar College. 
"The wider selection of majors 
and classes helps make school 
more interesting. " 

Upon their arrival to UCSD, 
transfer students are faced with 
problems ranging from housing to 
social acclimation . Their 
reactions to these problems as 
well as to UCSD are as diverse as 
the students themselves. 

Transfers "Alienated" 
Described by Muir College 

Provost John Stewart as "the 
most alienated students at 
UCSD," transfers must adjust to a 
different lifestyle as well as a new 
school. 

In an attempt to 'ease this 
transition the colleges have

Administration Moved 
To Action on Retention 

By Kathy Huffer 
AssoclaLe News EdiLor 

Within the past few year . 
retention has become the " buzz 
word" among faculty and 
administrators at UCSD. 

As the university has 
developed and neared a stable 
enrollment , in c re as ing 
attention has been focused upon-
the Cll uses and solutions of 
UCSD's difficulties in reta ining 
students. 

Administrators a re quick to 
point out that remedies to the 
retention problem are as 
complex as the causes 
themselves. 

"There are no simple 
s olutions." noteJ,i Vice 
Chancellor of AcademicAffairs 
Paul Saltman. " We need to 
work on bits and pieces." 
The University Takes Action 

and " whole animal-oriented" 
biology courses - academic 
a reas in high dema nd by 
students who leave UCSD -
will be offered to students here ' 
in an effort to expand the 
university 's " relatively narrow 
curriculum ," according to 
Warren Provost Lea Rudee. 

Although UCSD will not 
develop a business department, 
students will be able to minor in 

more financially feasible, he 
said . 

In addition to the focus upon 
specific academic areas, 
several administrators 
indicated that pre-registration 
information will be made 
clearer to incoming freshmen 
to insure understanding of 
UCSD 's academic offerings 
and requirements. 

" We should give students a 
sense of how hard it is without 
scaring the heck out of them," 
remarked Revelle Dean Ernie 
Mort . "The more pre -
application information we get 
out, the better." 

Watson said that although in 
the past he had expected 
potential students to read the 
university catalogue before 
committing themselves to 
UCSD, "we don't make tbat 
assumption anymore. " 

Attention, Too 

Last fall UCSD's first formal 
Retention Committee, com-
posed of administrators , 
faculty and a student, was 
formed. The committee studies 
and discusses methods of 
reducing the University's 
attrition rate, and makes 
recommendations to the 
Council of Provosts. 

-"We'd better be careful that 
we don't advertise to be 
something that we aren't," 
suggested Richard Armitage, 
vice chancellor of student 
affairs. 

Another element under 
scrutiny by administrators 
studying retention is the 
relationship between students 
and faculty , seen as unsatis-
factory by some students who 
have left UCSD.

students is a lack of

mpus housing. 
Ryan said, "I am extremely

Due to an increase in the 
mber of freshmen admitted last 
II , insufficient space was 

ilable to accommodate all the 
students, as had been the 

past years. The new 

Third/Warren apartments are 
hoped to alleviate this next year, 
according to a housing spokes-
person. 

But Keith' Han, a transfer from 
UC Davis. said, "Although the 
housing oCCice said they could not 
provide me with housing, in the 
end they came through, which is 
usually the case. " 

Other Problems 
A source of potential problems 

for all transfer students is the 
transferral of academic credits. 
According to Grobes, UCSD 
maintains a good liaison between 
schools which helps to eliminate 
problems. 

Greg Maletis, a transfer from 
De Anza Junior College, said, " I 
had no problems transferring 
credits; in fact, the adminis-
tration was quite helpful. " 

(Please turn to page 18) 

The committee "will work 
with anything that increases 
retention," according to Robert 
Starkey, committee chairman. 
Because the committee is 
young, it has been able to do 
little m·ore than make 
preliminary suggestions to the 
provosts, he said. 

In addition to committee and 
provost council studies, each 
college is evaluating its 
retention rate and seeking 
means to reduce the nlJmber of 
students which leave UCSD 
each year. 
Attention Given to Academics 

Because the foremost reason 
students cite for leaving UCSD 
is academic in nature , 
administrators are taking a 
close look at UCSD's academic 
structure.

Several courses in business are 
being taught this quarter , he 
said. 

Clinical psycbology classes 
were also begun this quarter 
and zoology courses will be 
offered next fall, according to 
Rudee. 

The addition of these three 
areas of study could "take care 
of about half of our ret"l!ntion 
problems ," said Joseph 
Watson, Third College Provost. 

Although nursing was a high 
priority major for many 
students who have left UCSD, 
"the cost to build up such a 
program would be tremen-
dous ," commented Rudee.

grams, on the other hand, is

"Students need to reach out 
to the faculty ," commented 
Saltman, adding that faculty 
need to become more aware of 
the retention problem. 

Watson said that "it's asking 
faculty too much to be buddy-
buddy" with students. 

, However, Mary Dhooge , 
Revelle assistant dean , 
remarked that Revelle is 
"facilitating as much in.ter-

in order to help increase 
student retention.

Cale made a rare west coast 
concert appearance last 
Sunday evening at the Whiskey . 
a Go-Go club in Los Angeles. 
currently one of the cjl:v ' ~ . and ' etherially symphonic pop 

albums. A list of his song titles 
gives a clue to the diversity of 
both Cales's lyrics and music: 

John Cale 

" Helen of Troy"; " Paris 1919" ; 
"Graham Greene"; " Chicken 
Shit" . 

It was Cale the Rocker who 
appeared on s tage tlfat night, 
though, backed by an outfit of 
punkish , but instrumentally 
skilled sidemen. In recent 
years Ca le ' has become a 
specialist in brooding musical 
examinations of violence and 
paranoia , developing a 
complementary singing style 
that squeezes every last drop of 
morbjdity out of his ambig-
uously threatening lyrics . Cale 
dressed for this role at the 
Whiskey, resembling in his 
mirror sunglasses , yellow 
hard-hat and undone black tie 
some sort of civil defense 
engineer gone berserk . 
Su rrounding himself in a 
growling wall of synthesized 
guitar riffs, Cale unleashed his 
latest fear-fraught compo-
sitions. 

A burly, physically imposing 
man, Cale loomed above the 
audience as his deep voice 
thundered out tales of mass 
panic, random murders, and 
assorted aberrant behavtor. 
Cale on record has often tested 
the boundaries between 
popular music and more free-
form modes. In conc~rt his 
band .sharpened their a1ready 
piercing rock thrusts with 

Perhaps most striking of all 
the new pieces presented was 
" Even Cowgirls Get The 
Blues," an eerie chant that had 
little or nothing to do with the 
Tom Robbins novel of the same 
title . The band's female 
vocalist, an otherworldly young 
lady named Deerfrance, softly 
wailed as Cale darkly 
murmured : " Even Cowgirs 
Get The llIues/Living/Down in 
Peru/Moving onto Caracasl.On 
Their Bellies Like Little Rats." 
Though the Whiskey crowd 
seemed eager for more fast-
moving rockouts , they Quieted 
down during this profoundly 
creepy number. 

For his encore Cale launched 
into the evening's most 
requested song, his imfamous 
rendition of "Heartbreak 
Hotel". Cale's version of the 
tune emphasizes the gloom of 
its lyrics to the point where 
Presley's hoary hit becomes 

• positively psychotic. While his 
group blasted on seemingly 
toward the point of critical-
mass he bellowed "We could be 
so lonely, we could DlIEEE!" 
as if he were Elvis returned 
from the grave. 

Call his shows rivetting 
entertainment or neurosis-as-
theater. John Cale is defiantly 
his own musician, an artist with 
academic credentials who 
chooses to get on stage and 
scream. Rock music is more 
exciting for it.

F or a couple of years now Dracula has been lying dormant , but like all 
things in Hollywood, he is 
making his inevitable come-
back. So far, at least a dozen 
Dracula films are lined up for 
summer release. Among the 
more notable productions on 
the boards are Germany's ' 
Nosferatu8, the Vampire, 
France's Dracula- Father and 
Son, and the eagerly awaited 
adaptation of Broadway 's 
Dracula. Love at First Bile, 
though, is the fi rsl of the 
releases to take a comedic 
approach to the subject. 
Although nostalgic Dracula 
fans may be offended by the 
flippant style of the film , Love 
at First Bite does offer some 
mild diversion. 

Tfiis film give Dracula a new 
twist and has him encoutering 
the New York of the 1970's. This 
Dracula , evicted from hi 
Transylvanian castle, comes to 
New York to find the covergirl 
with whom he has fa llen in love. 
From here the film relates a 
simple vampire· meets·girl , 
vampire-loses-girl , va mpire-

wins-girl-back storyline. The 
story, of course, also includes 
an odd assortment of charac-
ters·-an Igor-like assistant, a 
frantic psychiatrist and a 
troubled New York cop. 

George Hamilton, with his 
expressionless Cace, has finally 
found a part that fits his talents 
-- a corpse , Hamilton's 
beleaguered Dracula makes an 
amusing parody of the vampire 
image. Counterbalancing 
Hamilton's sedate perfor-
mance is Susan St. J ames as his 
flaky love interest. As the 
maniacal psychiatrist who 
cannot remember h6w to kill a 
vampire, Richard Benjamin 
delivers a hilarious perform-
ance. 

The script by Robert 
Kaufman overcomes the one-
joke boundaries that usually 
limit parodies, and deliver 
ome pleasant comedic 

moments. 

Love at First Bite, despite its 
silliness and predictability 
offers laughs. The film is now 
playing at Fashion Valley 
Four.

Robinson 
Band Has 
Princip'les 
T he Tom Robinson Band is a group with prin-

ciples. Finding the Roxy 
Theater in Pacific Beach being 
pi cketed by representatives of 
a stagehands ' union las t 
Monday (the Roxy i non-
union) , they volunteered to not 
play if there was a va lid 
dispute. After talking to the 
pickets and calling up the 
union they were unimpressed. 
but they offered to let the union 
state its case during their set 
(the union declined). Also. they 
decided to make their second 
show a free one, though this 
may have been more out of 
loneliness (only about 80 ti c~et 
had been sold) Uwn nnything 
el ·e. 

The Tom Robinson Band's 
principles cnrry over into their 
mu s ic. In some ways a 
throwback to the ferve nt 
activis m of the '60s, TRB lyrics 
are consistently a nli -E ta blish-
ment (t'emember the " Esta~ 
lishment"?), with a specific 
emphasis on gay rights (TR is , 
the rest of the n aren't) and 
human rights in general. nut 
while their hearts may be in the 
right pl ace, their hands 
sometimes aren't - that is to 
say, the band members are nol 
exceptional musicians. Mostly 
because of this , and despite the 
earnestness of the band and 
inger Robinson 's eagerness to 

please . the first haLfoftheirset 
failed to pa rk . Howeve r , 
things began to change when 
they got to "(Sing If You' re) 
Glad to Be Gay," a defiant 
answe,l' to oppre ion which 
obviously means a great dea l to 
Robinson . From then on TR and 
the B powered their way 
through a number of catchy and 
uplifting tunes. easily rousing 
the tiny crowd - one couldn't 
help but lea~e with a good 
feeling about the man, the band 
and their music . .

" To bring instrument

emphasis of the exhibition/ 
festival, according to its co-
organizer Ron George. 

Other activities are lWO 
concerts in the musical areas of 
percussion and varied 
instruments, two special group 
improvisational sessions from 
'random participants, and 
numerous individual demon-
strations and performances. 
The guest list is comprised of 
approximately 35 artists 
from all over Southern 
California, includin, UCSD 
staff. The various attractions of 
the exhibition/festival will be 
located at either of three 
places: The Center for Music

politics , which are " leftist. " 
They say the campus electorate 
swings toward conservatism in 
student elections. 

Candidates elected at 
Berkeley last year were self-
proclaimed conservatives who 
thought the AS was too active in 
partison politics , and promised 
to refuse their sa laries if 
elected, which they then did. 

Davis and Sacramento State, 
both close to the state capital, 
have student bodies that are 
described by officials there as 
" completely apat hetic." A 
Davis AS officer said that state 
politics " don 't interest many 
people on campus. Students 
that are involved in politics are 
more intense about it, because 
of the greater opportunities, 
but there 's no more involve-
ment beyond that." 

All of the state schools 
surveyed had low turnouts. 
San Diego State had a 10% 
turnout, despite one of the most 
visible AS governments in the 
country. It operates a multi-
million dollar business , 
including the intramurals 
sports program, a bowling 
alley, racquetball courts and a 
legal aid program. 

Ed VanGinkel , a vice 
president in .the ASSDSU for 
two years, attributes the low 
turnout to a marketing 
problem. "In elections, it's 
tough to · get the students 
educated about the candidates . . 
We had ten candidates running 
for president this spring, and 
only two received any number 
of votes. 

"We prefer to be judged on 
the number of students who 
participate in our programs."

Chavez isn 't sure they are low. 
"We view these elections as 
local elections , and local 
elections just don 't get that 
much of a vote, anywhere. You 
can't compare a campus 
election to a US Presidential 
election," she says. 

USC's Student Senate Chair, 
Suzanne Alora , who serves as 
USC's president , says that 
another image problem in 
election tu rnou(s at college 
campuses i the number of 
registered voters. 

"When you talk about the 
percentage of people voting in a 
general election , you are 
talking about registered voters. 
In college, everyone is 
registered, so when the same 
number of people vote , it looks 
worse at the colleges," she 
says. 

"The main objective is to 
explain what it's all about," he 
continued. "What are its long 
range implications? Does it 
mean anything? " 

The main component of the 
three day program can be 
found in the event 's five panel 
discussions. Their topics are 
divided into the following 
categories: New Instrumental 
Resources - " What are the 
implications for the present 
and future ?", Expanding 
Percussion Resources - " How 
do percussionists and com-
posers deal with constantly 
expandi ng instrumental 
resources? ", Building Sound

The event is the combined

Although the exhibitionl 
festival has , as George puts it, 
" been in the making for a 
couple of years," this is the first 
time that a program focusing 
upon this particular field has 
been attempted. Despite its 
novelty, George is optimistic 
that the eveot will be received 
favorably .

However. the system 
occasionally falters and 
students are placed in a 
difficult situation. 

"The administration was not 
helpful in the transfer of my

them." said Sharon Daum-

discourage out-of-state

said Ron Howker of the 
Relistrars Office. 

This is renected in the fact 
that more than 70 percent of the 
transfer applications came 
from student. enrolled in 
CalHor.nia institutions .

Olivier Kolpin. a transfer

here are very theoretical and 
geared toward the graduate

undergraduates. This makes it 

difficult to apply knowledge to 
real world jobs." 

Social Ure: "No Surprises" 
Not all transfer students are 

aware of the social aspects of 
life at UCSD, according to 
Dhooge. However . of the 
students interviewed, most 
found UCSD to meet their 
expectations. 

Stephanie Davidson, a 
transfer from Loyola-Mary-

was no s urprise, being much 
what I expected: it is not as 
bad as some say. "

Retenti'on Studied 
(Continued from page 11) 
professor of education· who 
visited UCSD last year as a 
consultant, anything that 
increases a student·s involve-
ment 'with the university will 
increase retention. 

College deans keep this 
concept in mind as they pla n for 
"community-buil ding " a nd 
increased student activities . 

Although he does not hold a 
consensus opinion. Watson said 
UCSD needs to reduce central 
services to increase retention. 
" I( we' re going to improve our 
retention rate," he remarked, 
" we're going to have to focus 
more on a local level." 

In an attempt to retain more 
tuden ts. Third will encourage 

further student involvement in 
college functions and increase 
college recognition of tudents' 
accomplishments. according to 
Susan Montrose. acting dean at 
Third . 

Third 's new townhouse will 
play a major role in fostering a 
greater sense of community 
among students, she com-
mented. 

Muir will try to " better serve 
the students" by increasing 
staff visibility to students, 
develop a new &ocial center and 
4' teach our students to become 
involved." said Muir Acting 
Dean Judith Green. 

Student retention will be 
aided at Revelle by." building a 
sense of being a part of a 
group" through planning 
community projects and goals, 
said Dhooge. Revelle will try to 
limit " pure entertainment" 
programs and s upport 
interactive functions. she said. 

Warren , .too. is seeking 

means of impl'oving its " social 
ambience" through increased 
social interaction, according to 
Rudee. 

Additionat Ideas 
Administrators emphasize 

that retention efforts are still in 
a preliminary stage and· much 
more work and study is 
necessary before they will be 
able to reduce the University's 
high attrition rate . 

The Retention Commit~ee 
has recommended vario us 
areas to be investigated to the 
provos t council, according to 
Starkey . 

One area looked at by the 
committee is on-c ampus 
tudent jobs. Each staff office 
hould employ one or two 

students in proportion to four 
sta ff memb e rs . Starkey 
sugge ted , in order to involve 
more students on campus. 

A change from the quarter to 
semester system, too, would 
" be good for retention because 
there's only. two points to drop 
out instead of three." said 
Starkey .
