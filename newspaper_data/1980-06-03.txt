Atkinson Aide Surveys the 
UCSD Scene, Reports Sack 

Darling' Plans Numerous Meetings 
-BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 

NeWi Editor 
Chancellor-desjgnate Richard Atkinson has 

launched a probe at UCSD which arrived 
yesterday, but it won't be in Star Wars, Part VI. 

It (he) is human - Bruce Darling, a 27 -year-
old Atkinson protege dispatched to .-pend it 
month here as' Atkinson'. eyes and ears, and 
report to him "when he wants." 

Darling has been appointed Special Assistant 
to the Chancellor, and his only job, until July 1, 
when Atkinson arrives, is to talk to people 
around campus and get their ideas and "a broad 
view of concerns ~ere." 

"I think I was selected to come out here 
because I can tell him what I think," Darling 
says, "and I'm concerned with detail." 

Darling does have some specific notions 
about what he's going to be focusing on here. 

"I want to talk to the vice chancellors about 
their areas of activity and what they do, and I 
want to talk about the computer center. There's 
a controversy about academic use vs. 
administrative use. I'll talk to the participants 
and see what they think about the whole thing," 
Darling said. 

He anticipates no major changes in the way 
the university is run with Atkinson as chancellor. 

"The university has already decided thaf 
sciences and research are its top priority and I 
don't expect there11 be any radical changes in. 
that. . . " . 

"I had thought UCSD had a...much broader 
currie.·"" then it hu, but I'm ot disappointed 
when I consider the age of the' university." 

Darling believes Atkinson's administrative 
ability will be the major force of Atkinson's 
tenure. 

"(Atkinson is) just remarkable. He's the first 
social scientist to be director of the National 

Science Foundation and he"managed to garner 
support from different factions, define his 
objectives and marshall support. 

"In a university environment where faculty 
and adminiltration don't have the tame viewl 
on a lot of things, hell be great," Darling 
believes. 

While he doesn't know a lot about the 
univer.aity yet - "I've only talked in general 
terms about the place; I don't know a lot about 
it" - Darling expects to be in frequent 
communication with Atkinson as he learns. 

He plans to visit Atkinson in mid-June when 
the chancellor-designate is in Palo Alto for a 
science conference. and. Darling notes, hell be

'Ask The Shah' Obscene, Vile 
Editor: 

I wish to express my 
extreme displeasure, offense, 
and reaenbnent to May 19's 
column "Ask the Shah". A 
number of adjectives come to 
mind which aptly describe this 
Ann Landers style dialogue 
between the deposed Shah and 
Governor Jerry Brown: 
obscene, immoral, dirty, vae, 
fathy, foulmouthed, laacivi-
OUl, lewd, ~centious, smutty, 
pornographic, and shameful, 
to name a few. Quite a bit of 
imagination surely wiil needed 
to construct this satire. The 
author waa pretty clever in 
weaving the plight of the Shah 
and the me of the Governor 
into a simply disgusting 
procession of perverted puns, 
indecent innuendos, and 
downright gross references to 
certain bodily parts. 

We all have our own special 

ways· of tapping the reservoir 
of creativity within us. Some of 
us ~ke to have soothing 
classical music in the 
background. Others prefer 
quiet isolation. Some compose 
their thoughts by means of a 
hike in the forest or a walk on 
the beach. As for the author of 
the column, I don't want to 
know what lowly means were 
used to formulate such 
perverse expressions on world 
affairs and public figures! 

Though such sludgy 
language and pornographic 
mustrations were not used 
elsewhere in the column to this 
degree, the portrayal of the 
Shah as a master villain and of 
vanous world figures as ' 
tyrants, oppressors , and 
hypocrites seeking his advice 
to deal with their own affairs 
has become so banal through 
excessive re-runs that the 

Give Cap and Gown 
Money to Favorite 
Charity Organization 
Editor: 

When I was notified that I would be able to rent a cap and 
gown for graduation for $10 from the bookstore, I went 
through lOme simple arithmetics in my mind. Let's see, I 
thought, 500 seniors times $10 each comes to $5,000. Not a 
bad sum, I concluded, and IOmething KSDT or the political 
film series might not mind getting a hold of. 

During lOme minor footwork I discovered that in the spring 
the bookstore rents out about 1200 graduation ensembles 
(which it rents from another party). That means that about 
$12,000 is spent on the caps and gowns for the spring 
ceremonies. After coming up with the latter sum, I was 
reminded of a proposal made by a Dartmouth College student 
last spring: that each graduating Dartmouth student spend 
the money he had slated for caps and gowns on his favorite 
group. 

I make the same suggestion to this year's graduating 
seniors: give your $10 to your favorite group (may I suggest 
the arms control division of the Union of Concerned Scientists 
or another group working in defence and disarmament 
studies). Then, on graduation day, simply wear your favorite 
outfit. 

DOROTHY HOUSTON 

column fails to be effective in 
any way. The column only 
serves to , ruthlessly attack 
personalities, not policies. 
How does the portrayal of 
Anita Bryant as a dumb broad 
address homosexuality? What 
contribution to theology, or 
atheism, is to be found in the 
implication that John Paul II 
has a papal harem? The 
column is nothing but a 
collection of biases and 
prejudices supported solely by 
ad hominems. Such evidence 
fails to yield an indictment on 
anything except exceedingly 
poor taste! 

I am very disappointed with 
the Daily ' Cuardian for 
running such an article that 
cannot be said to have any 
social redeeming value. Of 
course, the proponents of the 
article and many press people 
will surely cry censure on my 
part, but if this is censure, it is 
only because such people 
choose to call it that. I prefer to 

call ,it establishing, complying 
with, and enforcing of 
standards of decency. On a 
scale of 0-10, "Ask the Shah" 
rates a O. 

I demand an apology to the 
reading public. I hope the 
Daily Guardian never resorts 
to such a professional low 
again by being a party to such 
decadence. Besides making 
this grievance and merely 
urging the rectification of a 
regretful situation, I frankly 
admit that this is the extent of 
my protest.1f apology is not 
made, and if more of the same 
is printed, so be it. I could 
organize a boycott or picket of 
the paper, petition the AS 
Council to cu t funds , seek legal 
remedies to have my 
registration fees not go for 
your paper, and many other 
activist activities. But I am not 
so foolish and naive as to 
divert precious titne and 
energy from studies and 
money from my own pocket in' 

the belief that the Daily 
Guardian will bow and 
crumble in the wake of my 
onslaught as those fVho are 
presently attempting to bar 
military recruiters from 
campus. But if such scum 
journalism continues, you'll 
find fewer friends to pat you on 
the back, to rely on you for 
vital information, and to side 
with you against the forces 
that are contrary to a free, 
unhindered press.

Dear Mom: College Great, Learning to Talk 
'New Yorker Unravels Language of Alien So Cal Culture 

Dear Mat and the Tat in the Crib, 
I apologize for not writing home 

sooner, but it has taken me a long time 
to get settled in at UCSD. Even without 
my intensive scholastic endeavors, it 
would have been difficult to adjust to 
the California lifestyle. I have had to 
accustom myself to a new language 
and an alien culture. 

Jonathon Kroll, is a news writer for 
The Daily Guardian. 

The pace of life here is much slower 
than at home. Being from New York 
(my friends refer to me as "the New 
Yawkah") I speak very quickly 
because, by upbringing, I am always 
supposed to be in a hurry. Here in 
Southern California they linger over 
each syllable of every word. 

When I arrived on campus I was 
unable to communicate with the first 
Triton I met, Peter D. Wood. I asked 
the first blond-haired Californian I saw, 
"Could ja-please-durect-me-ta-the-
Thoid -College -Resident -Dean's -Of-
fice . I-gotla-pick-up-my-apahtment-
key-and-find-out-where-l-live ?" 

"Huh ??? , .. What .. kind . . of .. 
bizarre . . language . . are . . you . .

looked at me in disbelief that I waa from 

his planet. , 
I reiterated my demand, " I-gotta-

find-the-Dean!Couldja-also-show-me-
where-l-can-get-some-watah,l'm-dy-
in'-of-thoist." 

Pete looked at me incredulously. 
"What .. did . . you .. say? ... You 
want . . some . .'watah'? . .. What . . is . 

watah?" he queried in his slow 

sun too long. I soon found out, 
however, that everyone spoke slowly, 
even the few students who didn't have 
blond hair and blue eyes. 

For the first few weeks of .chool I , 
kept my mouth shut. J practiced my 
speech speed and pronunciation when 
my roommate went to class and I waa 
alone. 

Gnarly - l)difficult: 
nasty; 2)"a radical ~ituation"

fountain . . right . . next .. to .. the . . 
tennis . . courts .. . As .. for .. the . . 
Dean's .. office . . . you . . go .. . " 

I cut him off before he could finish , 
because I had to pick up my room key 
within four days, and I didn't want to be 
late. "Thanks-a-Iot," I muttered to the 
person, who I assumed had been in the 

After weeks of concentrated effort I 
slowed down my speech. Others were 
able to understand me, even the 
5lU'fers, but I .till could not understand 
them. I adjusted to their speaking rate, 
but their vocabulary was alien to me. 
Southern Californians have their own 
private lingo. I call it Califese. Here are 
just a few of the words that caused a 
communication lIap:

named John from Tioga. A tough 
exam is gnarly, and 10 i.the food in the

gnarly. 

Head ~ toilet: bathroom. The first 
time I heard this word was when 
IOmeone asked me where'he could find 
a head. Trying to be as biendly as any 
Southern Californian, I wanted to help, 
but I didn't know what a head was. 

"A head,. eh? You would like to 
know where a head is?" I responded as . 
I looked for a aign that said "head." I 
suspected that he was not looking for a 
drug addict so I continued to stall unta I 
could get some clue as fo what a head 
was. 

"Let me see, a head. The head of 
what?" . 

He walked away in disgust, making 
some inaudible reference to the East 
coast. I went to the bathroom to hide, 
fearing reprisal in the fashion of New 
York. While I was in there, 
contemplating a transfer to Bolton 
University, someone yelled, "Hey, this 
head doesn't have any paper towd.!" 
, The mystery was solved. I Jeft the 
head, relieved, I felt I had j~st become

Ten Travel to Iran 
Despite Carter's Ban 

Ten Americans including 
former Attorney Ge neral 
Ramsey Clark and Nobel 
Prize -winning biologist 
George Wald defied a Justice 
Oeparbnent ban on travel to 
Iran and participated 
yesterday at the opening of a 
" Cf imes of America " 
.conference in Tehran. US 
State Department spokesman 
Hodding Carter called the 
four .day conference " a 
propaganda circus." 

Iran's revolutionary leader, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
meini , urged non-government 
conference delegates from 50 
nations to "condemn the US 
oppressors," and Clark told a 
Western interviewer that the 
failed US hostage rescue 
miSSion was "lawless and 
contrary to constitutional 
government." 

"It is inconceivable that 
constitutional government 
could ever delegate to a single 
person - president or prime 
minister - the power to risk 

Get out /Tom under--

killing many people half a 
world away in a foreign 
country," Clark said of the 
failed hostage rescue mission 
ordered by President Cal ter in 
whi c h eight Ameri can 
commandos were killed. 

The Americans at the 
conference could be sentenced 
in the United States to up to 10 
years in prison and fined as 
much as $50,000, but Carter 
administration officials said 
the government had not yet 
decided whether to prosecute 
them. 

The threatened penalties 
are part of an international 
economic emergency measure 
Carter used on May 18 to ban 
nearly all travel to Iran . 
Journalists were exempted 
from the order.

Anderson Wants 
In on Debates 

NEW YORK - John 
Anderson says he is counting 
on the "hot breath of public 
opinion" to force President 
Carter to include him in any 
fall debates with GOP 
challenger Ronald Reagan. 

As of now, public opinion is 

on Anderson's side. 
An Associated Press-NBC 

News poll says a majority of 
Americans reject Carter's 
decision to debate Reagan, but 
not Anderson, an independent 
candidate. 

Fifty-three percent of the 
public disapproves of Carter's 
stance. Only 36 percent 
approve of it. Eleven percent 
of the 1,615 adults 
interviewed nationwide by 
telephone last Wednesday and 
Friday were not sure. 

Carter said over the 
weekend that he was eager to 
debate Reagan, but would not 
participate in any debate that 
included Anderson . 

"I see no reason why I 
should debate against two 
Republicans, who had been 
active in the Republican Party, 
who have held positions of 
leadership in the Republican 
Party, who have a Republican 
voting record," Carter said 
Sunday on the CBS-TV 
program "Face the Nation." 

Pope Condemns 
DNA Research 

PARIS - Pope John Paul 
II, ending a busy four-day visit 
to France, said yesterday that 
experiments to modify gene. 
are as dangerous to mankind's 
future as chemical, bacterio-
logical or nuclear weapons. 

In a speech to the UN 
&Iucational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization in 
Paris, the spiritual leader of the 
world's Roman Catho~t:i said 
"the future of man and 
mankind ' is . . . radically 
threatened, in spite of very 
noble intentions, by men of 

. " sCience. 

He specifically linked 
"genetic manipulations in 
biological experiments" with 
weaponry as goals or results . 
"contradictory to those of 
humanity."

Salk ~ientist _nvestigates Use 
Of Vitamin Against Cancer 

Vitamin A Derivative May Stop Growth of Cancer Cells 
BY PAUL DENT 

Scientists may still be far 
from discovering a cure for 
cancer, but research at nearby 
Salk Institute involving the use 
of common vitamin A 
derivitives to kill tumorous cell 
growth is being called a step in 
the right direction. 

This promising method for 
treating cancer is under 
investigation by Gunther 
Dennert, an associate 
research professor in the . 
Cancer Biology Laboratory at 
Salk. His research has been 
directed toward finding ways 

It was documented long ago 
that certain derivatives of 
vitamin A, and specifically 
one known as retinoic acid , 
would reduce the rate of 
proliferation of cancerous cells 
when introduced into 
mammals . A friend of 
Dennert's, Reuben Lotan, has

Another drawback il that the 
effectiveness of vitamin A

by increaling the dosage, 
since all of these compounds 
are toxic. Some are leal toxic

Atkinson 
Continued from page 1 
it" - Darling expects to be in 
frequent communication with 
Atkinson as he learns. 

He plans to visit Atkinson in 
mid·June when the chancellor-
designate is in Palo Alto for a 
science conference, a nd , 

Dar~ng notes, he'll be around 
whenever Atkinson wants to 
know about something. 

"Atkinson is a great one for 
just picking up the phone and 
talking to some one . That's 
why he has so many -sources of 
information on things. I 
imagine -I'll talk to him 
whenever he picks up tht! 
phone to call me," Darling 
says. . 

For· the time being, that will 
be difficult. · Darling arrived in 
San Diego Saturday night, 
and he is sleeping on the floor 
with no telephone i'n an 
apartment complex that will be 
converted to condominiums in 
a few months. 

In the meantime , he's 
getting used to the idea of 
living in California again. Born 
in Fresno , he did his 
und e rgra duate work at 
UCLA and has several 
relatives and friends in the 
IItate. 

One person he plans to meet 
this week is Silly AS President 

J~remy Charlton. Darling says 
he isn't sure how that will work 
out. 

"Without meeting a person 
I can't make a judgment about 
what they're like. I don't know 
whether he's using the tide as 
an accurate portrayal or an 
ironic title," Darling says.

goulash) J met my buddy, 
Marco. 

"Hey amigo, I see you're 
coming out of the cal. You 
have just been reamed," he 
said. 

"Reamed? What does that 
mean?" I asked. 

"Reamed. You know -
500 sheets." He walked away . 
with a big grin, leaving me to 
ponder his answer. 

That night I knew what he 
meant. J came down with 
McFJroy's revenge. I spent the 
night in the head, cursing 
Revelle cafeteria and chug.a. 
lugging Kaopectate. 

Scope out - to look 
something over; check out:

walking our way," for 
example.

Well, this is just a sampling 
of the CaJifese I have learned 
lIO far . I feel confident that I 
will be speaking like a native 
shortly. It is imperative that I 
do so, otherwise I will have to 
get C.LA.P. on my schedule 
next year. The California 
ungo Aptitude Program is 
required for all out·of·state 
students who cannot speak 
proficient CaJifese, and want 
to establish residency.
