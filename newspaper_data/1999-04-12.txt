PHILADELPHIA, Pa. -
Samir Ali, a Temple University 
student majoring in theater, 
was arrested and charged with 
two counts of aggravated 
assault, simple assault, rape, 
unlawful imprisonment and 
narcotics possession last 
Wednesday night. Police say 
that Ali pretended to be the dri-

_ ver of a taxi in order to pick up 
women. Allegedly, Ali would 
take the women to his home, 
force them to undress in his 
basement "torture chamber" 
and rape them. One of these 
women escaped from Ali's 
underground "prison" and 
alerted authorities of the attack. 
Many of Ali's peers called him 
a nice guy and said they were 
in shock over this recent news.

comes two or three weeks 
after spring break. In April 
1997, these tests reached a 
record high and 43 percent of 
those tested were positive for 
pregnancy and 7 percent who 
tested for chlamydia were

say that this increase is due to 
the hi.gher frequency of 
unprotected sex during spring

NEW HAVEN, Conn. -As 
a part of a 60-year-old tradi-
tion, Yale seniors traded in 
the cover page of their senior 
essays ift exchange for one 
free beer on the house at 
Ruby 's Bar. The pages get 
pinned up on twine stretching 
across the bar. Students who 
had not finished their e,ssays 
but wanted to participate in 
the festivities pinned up fake 
cover sheets. Some of the 
cover pages that were fake 
had titles such as "Hey Bitch, 
That's My Corner: A study of 
prostitution in New Haven," 
"Masturbation, a way of 
life," and "Eat me, Aztec 
cannibalism and the Spanish 
reaction." During the event, 
inebriated senior Dan Dudis 
reflected on his approaching 
graduation date and said that 
graduating from Yale is "like 
sleeping with Brad Pitt - I 
can't quite believe it."

All-Campus 
Grnduation 
Cancelled 
DECISION: Ceremony 
called off due to difficulties 
in securing a speaker 
By leena Shankar 
News Editor 

The all-campus commencement 
exercises have been canceled thi s 
year due to difficulties in securing a 
suitable speaker. Vice Chancellor of 
External Relations James Langley 
released a tatement to the 
Commencement Speaker Committee 
last Wednesday announcing the can-
cellation. 

All-campus commencement began 
in June 1997 when President Bill 
Clinton came to speak at a ceremony 
for the graduates of all fi ve colleges 
and graduate programs. 

Last year, Speaker of the U,S. 
House of Representatives Newt 
Gingrich delivered the all-campus 
address amid much controversy 
regarding his invitation. 

Langley said that this year the 
committee had a difficult time attract-
ing a speaker of a caliber comparable 
to that of Clinton or Gingrich. 

"We were unsuccessful in finding 
a commencement speaker of the 
stature that we had wanted, but I can 
assure you that we made an earnest 
effort," Langley said, "We pulled out 
all the stops." 

The committee submitted a list of 
five potential speakers to Dynes so 
that he could extend invitations to 
them. Four were invited and all four 
declined to speak at the all -campus 
commencement exercises. 

"All the people we asked were 
unavailable or uninterested," said 
Thomas Bond, provost of Revelle 
College and a member of the com-
mencement speaker commi ttee.

UCSD Hosts Prospective Freshmen 
PREVIEW: 8,(0) people 
turned out to attend 
UCSD's Admit Day 
By Jacob Schechter 
Staff Writer 

UCSD hosted its annual Admit 
Day that gave thousands of 
prospective students and their fam-
ilies a chance to learn more about 
the campus and what the school has 
to offer on Saturday. 

Nancy Saint John, public infor-

mati on representative for the 
UCSD Admissions Office, said that 
this year 's Admit Day had a high 
tumout of people. 

"[ estimate that there were at 
least 8,000 people here for Admit 
Day, which is significantly higher 
than last year 's attendance of 
7,000," Saint John said. 

The prospective students, who 
have already been admitted to 
UCSD, went to both campuswide 
events and programs at the individ-
ual colleges., . 

As part of the campuswide 
activities, about 30 clubs show-
cased themselves at a Student 
Organization Fair on Library Walk, 

"The [Student) Organization 
Fair was a fantastic success," Saint 
John said. "I really enjoyed walk-
ing up and down Library Walk 
because the OJ club was there with 
the music booming, and all the 
clubs were out. It gave admitted 
students a great chance to feel what 
college is really like." 

At the Price Cenler, Chancellor 

Robert Dynes answered questions 
at a booth named "Meet the 
Chancellor." 

"I'm here for anyone who wants 
to ask me a question," Dynes said. 
"Most of these kids have already 
decided to come to UCSD next 
year, and today they ' re looking for 
a reaffirmation of that decision, so 
that's what I'm here for." 

Saint John said she viewed this 
booth as a succe sful addition to 
Admit Day's standard annual pro-

our math and science departments, the glue that binds 
a university together in collective spirit and allegiance 
conti nues to wither from institutional neglect. 

[ believed that this de-emphasis on a unified student 
body made it all but impossible to create a cohesive 
school spirit and to preserve any remnants of tradition. 
However, for me to cloak this matter .with such an ill-
researched, blanket argument would be unjust, and 
well, ignorant. One can map out all the components that have 

steered this institution away from such a nuisance as 
tradition . One could start lightly, mentioning the 
ahsence of a football team (whip), the nearly total 
absence of parties (slash), the demanding quarter sys-
tem in which precious lillie time is spared to stop, cod.s of behavior 

In response to this, shall we say, moral awakening,

skimming recent events, old archives and awards.

Further, one could state that there is a lack of kin-

made treacherous and unwelcoming by the sheer length 
and steepness of inclines (stomp). 

Without kinship a school cannot breed a loyal and

views, but represent themselves to

instead of making individual 
decisions for each office, may 
allow the victory of unquali-
fied or inferior candidates 
because of a few very strong 

in general. If done right, a 
poster about anything livens up 
the campus. Election posters in 
particular allow us to realize the 
diversity of UCSO's student lead-
ers. Some people can draw, others 
shouldn't. Some people can come 
up with willy slogans; others 
shou ld stick to a simple "Vote for 
me." Individuali.ty is great. 

Naturally. this opinion leads to 
the conclusion that I am not 
opposed to the individual mem-
bers of the two slates. Their 
posters would be great if they left 
otT the slate names. My problem is 
not with the posters, not with the 
people, but with the slates them-
selves. The posters are merely 
large reminders of the monopoliz-
ing force that slates have in UCSD 
elections. 

This monopoly is largely 
harmful to the outcome of elec-
tions, and therefore to the quality 
of student govemment at UCSD. 
In theory, a slate is composed of 
candidates with similar ideology 
and visions for the campus. In 
practice, however, how can a slate 

candidate group that didn 't really 
consider itself a slate. The group 
wanted to work together next year 
to change UCSD for the beller. 
With a slate like this, what hap-
pens if some members don 't get 
elected? Can one or two, if elect-
ed, change the campus without 
their cohorts'!- Can members of 
two different slates, two different 
"camps," work together effective-
ly when they' re thrown together 
into student government? 

The problem stems from the 
slates themselves, but is exagger-
ated hy the student population's 
response to the slates. Average 
UCSD students do not have the 
time, energy or desire to investi-
gate individual candidates' abili -
ties or to even read the sample bal-
lots. They may rely on friends, 
posters or other publicity to help 
them make decisions about voting 
- if they vote at all. The power of 
simple publicity stunts is evi-
denced by the energy that the 
slates put into creative campaign-
ing. If it didn 't work, they would-

candidates on the same slate. 
Uneducated voters may assume 
that if one candidate is a good 
choice, then their slatemate is also 
a good choice, since, in theory, 
they have similar ideology. This 
does not take into account experi-
ence or individual opinions, and is 
thus a poor method of voting. The 
existence of slates facilitates, if 
not encourages, sUl:h lazy voting 
habits. 

Slates are detrimental to the 
UCSD student government in that 
they allow the election of candi-
dates to office through their 
alliance with a particular group of 
people, not because of their abili-
ty to do the job. 

The good news is that this situ-
ation is totally under the control of 
the voters. We are to blame for the 
longevity of the slate system. If, in 
the future, UCSD students choose 
to ignore the slates, and vote based 
on the abilities of the individual 
candidates, we can move toward a 
real change in student government 
and really start pUlling students 
first. Put that on a poster.

UCSD was not the genesis of 

this community, as most universi -
ties are to their communities. It was 
the newcomer, Ihe guest. Had 
UCSD not adhered to the codes of 
behavior that preserve La 10lla's 
serene, utopian-like atmosphere, it 
would not have been permilled to 
eome into existence. 

UCSD is still a new school that 
is eager to make its mark. The uni-
versi ty has to build for the future 
before it can be content with its 
heritage or legacy. Its passion is for 
times to come - for acadt!l1lic ter-
rain yet to be conquered. 

The rapid progress of UCSD is 
inspiring. It is this very 7,eal for the 
future and progress that constitutes 
UCSD's tradition. 

However, UCSD student s 
seem to play a small role in the 
consolidation and progress of the 
schoo l. We are, dare I say, inci -

ever-changing breezes of al:ade-
mia, wafting in and out of austere

It is hard to say whether or not 
this polari zation between institu -
tion and student is a sym tom of 
a new universi ty. Certainly the 
fervor of a student hody is an 
indelible ingredient to the ongo-
ing vitality and popularity of a 
school. 

Perhaps we are embarking on a 
new era, in which the future holds 
the baton in this academic relay 
race. This is an time in which 
ungrateful students will pipe down,

in the lackadaisical serenity of this

WOMEN'S RIGHTS WEAKENED BY PRESIDENT 
Editor: 

Cathy Brazil 's article "Jeans 
Prevent Rape" on April 8 was 
right on the money. But it is not 
just in Italy where women are 
being blamed for their fa lling prey 
to an assault. Fallout from the 
Clinton acquittal means that court -
rooms all across Ameri ca are hear-
ing the Clinton l:asc as legal prece-
dent to degrade the seriousness of 
sexual assault. 

In New Jersey, for instance, the 
high court has rel:ently ruled that 
sexual assault is a valid character-
ization only if penetration took 
place. [n fact, the entire judicial 
system is threatened with collapse 
since perjury no longer carries a 
real punishment. 

That is just the beginning of the 
fallout. Now, it is no longer certain 
whether any citizen will find pro-
tection under the law. One must 
ask what so-called women's rights 
groups such as the National 
Organi zati on for Women (N.O.W.) 
really stand for when endorsing 
the proven mi sbehavior of 
President Clinton while punishing 
others like Judge Clarence 
Thomas based on false accusa-

tions. The only explanation lies in 
the fact that such women's groups 
have violated the trust of their sup-
porters and are nothing more than 
a political-action machine. 

Their liberal agenda is not 
about helping women and is caus-
ing our society 's dangerous slide 
toward an autocrati c tyranny. 
These groups are partly to blame 
for the fact that many of the strides 
women have made since the turn 
of the century.have been erased in 
the last 10 years. 

It is time to act to restore equal 
justice under the law by rightfully 
punishing those who assault our 
well-being in an equal and ade-
quate manner. That includes our 
mes meri zing and beloved 
President Clinton.

Personally, I am becoming 
. frustrated with the developments 
of political activity on this cam-
pus. The use of slates is creating a 
mirror of political mechanisms 
reproduced in our society at large. 
We have two major parties in this 
country, we have two major slates 
here. They are both washed-up 
band wagoners more intent on win-
ning than changing in 
[Washington) D.C., and it seems 
the same here. I wouldn' t mind 
seeing a little change to move into 
the bureaucracy around here. That 
is one reason why I was such a big 
fan of Joe Leventhal's indepen-
dent maneuver politically - he 
won and has honestly tried to 
learn, grow and improve. 

Now let me say that I am con-
structing this argument as all the 
facts are true. This may not be the 
case, but at least some of the facts 
are true, or else this disqualifica-
tion wouldn't even be happening. 
Moving on, I see that Students 
First! should I) be ashamed for 
having a member who would com-
mit acts of stifling opposing opin-
ions and 2) be condemned for 
actually defending the people 

accused. Proper politics is not 
being bred · in our generation in 
general, and it seems like Students 
First! wants to lead the way in 
poor politics. Any threats given in 
similar situations challenge the 
good conscience of "civilization" 
at large, and while minor at the 
level of these low-level political 
farces, they still point out prob-
lems we are facing as adults enter-
ing the world of global politics. 

Which brings me to the topic of 
slates. This is something that I 
think, while rightly Qutside the 
realm of ofticial censure, should 
be dealt with socially. 

Hopefully, if enough people 
actually wake up to the realities of 
slates and bandwagoning in gener-
al , they will disappear. Don't com-
promise on what you think is right 
for the sake of sharing advertising 
costs and marginalized improve-
ments in election potential. 

I say support the natural rights 
that you believe everyone should 
have, and let's hope that Pat Ru 
and the other slate sheep he leads 
actually, honestly try to be origi -
nal.

campaigning this year. 

"Last year, I only got 18 percent 
of the vote, so it was a very signif-
icant loss," Khullar said. "This 
year, [ knew I campaigned the best 
I could." 

Lertzman said that despite her 
disappointment, she hopes that next 
year's council will be successful. 

"Clearly, I was disappointed 
that I lost," Lertzman said. "But I 
wish Tesh the best, and I hope 
everyone will be able 10 work as a 
team to serve the students in the 
best way possible." 

Ru said that despite his own 
loss, he was more disappointed that 
more Students First! senate candi-
dates did not win. 

"I think some of the Students 
First! senate candidates that lost 
deserved to be in A.S.," Ru said. 
"For me personally, ( think it's time 
for me to leave A.S. and pursue 
other outlets." 

Khullar, who takes office during 
the fifth week of this quarter, said 
he looks forward to working with 
the new A.S. Council. 

"I think it 's a great group of 
independents, Students First! and 
Change members," Khullar said. "I 
want to get right into it and start. 
This is going to be a very critical 
year because it will lead us into the 
millennium." 

Khullar said that after passing 
the executive budget, he would like 
to see a new aonstitution passed. 

"( have a lot of work ahead of 
me," Khullar said. "If it 's in any 
way possible at all , I'd like to see [a 
new constitution) done in the fi rst 
live weeks." 

Vice President Internal-e lect 
Jennifer Lee said she will work 
with Khullar in passing a new con~ 
stitution. 

"Whatever Tesh proposes, I 
want to have some input on it as 
well," Lee said. "I would like to 
hold a constitutional convention so 
everyone can have input on it. It 
will not be rushed, ~ut 1 do think 
A.S. needs a new constitution, and 
I am willing to work with Tesh on 
it."

said even though not all members 
of Students First! won, she looks

the new A.S. Council. 
. "Although I was disappointed 

with some of the elections results, [ 
think the newly elected commis-
sioners and senators will be dedi-
cated to putting students tirst," Lee 
said. "( am very proud to be with 
people who are very passionate 
about working for students." 

Lee said that her lirst priority 
will be to meet with the newly 
elected senators to educate them on 
the duties of senators and the work-
ings of the' A.S. Council. 

Current A.S. Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs and Change can-
didate Doc Khaleghi lost the vice 
president internal race to Lee. 
Khaleghi said that despite the loss, 
he was pleased to see fellow 
Change member Khullar win the 
presidency. 

"With Tesh winning, I walked 
away from these elections happy," 
Khaleghi said. "I take solace in the 
fact that we will have strong presi-

important thing to me. I think he 
will bring strong leadership to A.S.

results. 
"I was extremely, extremely 

excited," Patterson said. "Though it 
was a bit disappointing to be with a 
group of guys that [' ve worked 
with for so long and not see them 
get elected, I think they handled it 
really well and that made it easier 
for me and Tesh. Overall, it was an 

, extremely intense moment." 
Patterson said that as the first 

non-Students First! member to 
occupy the Extemal Affairs Office 
in recent history he plans to bring 
change to the office by re-evaluat-
ing UCSD's involvement with 
University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) and the 
United States Student Association 
(USSA) and focusing on more 
localized issues. 

"Although this year the external 
office has done a good job, I think 
[this election) is a sign that students 
are ready for a change in that 
office, and local issues are ready to 
be addressed," Patterson said. 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy-elect Rosaline Chan said 
that although she was hoping for 
more Students First! members to be 
elected, she thinks that Change and 
Students First! members will be 
able to ccoperate on most issues. 

"I think with the issues that 
affect all students, Students First! 
members along with Change memo 
bers will be able to work together 
because we all have students' best 
interests at heart," she said. 

Patterson added that he hopes 
A.S. Council will function effec-
tively despite political differences. 

"Once again we are going to 
have a mixed group of executives," 
Patterson said. "I hope everyone 
can set past elections aside and 
work together to make this year a 
successful year for the Associated 
Students." 

The two fee referenda on the 
ballot - one to fund the expansion 
of the University Centers and the 
other to fund the Academic Success 
Program - both failed . Although 
both referenda received majority 
suppon, they needed a higher voter 
turnout to pass. 

The proposed University 
Centers fee referenda required 

. 3,711 undergraduate and graduate 
students to tum out to vote in order 
to pass; however, less than that 
number voted in the election.

"Instead of having Chancellor

there was a huge crowd around 
him asking questions and listening

Saint John said that the univer-

"Another new thing we did this 
year was we helped the Black 
Alumni Scholarship Committee 
host a reception for about 80 
admitted African American stu-

Additionally, some of the 
prospective students had the 
opportunity to he a "pre-frosh" by 
staying on campus with a student 
host Friday night before going to 
Admit Day on Saturday. 

"We had a total of around 250 
students take this option," Saint 
John said. "Each pre-frosh had a 
student host who they could fol-

prospecti ve students went to class-

with them and slept in their room. 
Then, we served them breakfast

"It gave him a good chance to 
feel the campus pulse and to see 
that UCSD involves more than 
just how it's portrayed in the 
brochures," he said. 'The next 
day, I even got an e-mail from him 
saying that he's decided to come 
here next year." -

Seminars were held at the Price 
Center Ballroom and Center Hall 
throughout the day. At these infor-
mation sessions, professors dis-
cussed faculty research, student 
services presented information on 
the opportunities they provide, 
and faculty fielded questions from 
the audience. 

The Jacobs School of 
Engineering also held tours and

overview sessions throughout the 
day for anyone interested in its 
programs. 

Besides these campus wide 
events, each college offered 
unique tours, information sessions 
and separate activities highlight-
ing the college's educational 
approach and social atmosphere. 

At Revelle college, prospective 
students enjoyed a Fun House 
with carnival-like games and 
prizes. 

'This is the first time thatI've 
been to UCSD. and I've really 
enjoyed it so far," Revelle admit 
Katy Marcourt said. "Everything 
is green outside, and I just went on 
a student tour of the dorms that 
was very helpful." 

Muir college offered musical 
entertainment, a barbecue and a 
Sidewalk Sale. 

"Everyone's been really friend-
ly, and I liked the music and th~ 
chance to see the rooms, 
prospective Muir student Jessica 
Taylor said. 

Spirit also ran high at 
Roosevelt, which offered pro-
gramming based on the theme 
"Windows to the World." 

'This is my first trip to UCSD, 
and it feels more peaceful and 
secluded than the other campuses 
that I've been to," Roosevelt admit 
Tim Kim said. "Also, everyone's 
been very courteous and helpful," 

Thurgood Marshall also hosted 
its annual cultural celebration as 
part of its Admit Day activities 
(see story page two). . 

Besides offering the standard 
tours and information sessions, 
the accepted students at Warren 
also enjoyed jazz music and a bar-
becue.

The Academic Success Program 
fee referenda required a 25 percent 
voter turnout for passage; however. 
only 24.95 percent of the student 
body voted in the election. 

A.S. President Joe Leventhal 
said that he was disappointed to see 
low voter turnout stand in the way 
of the two fee referenda.

she worked at the booth in order to 
"to make people aware of our cul-

people. 

Marshall college students set up 
an additional booth selling 
American fanfare, such as hotdogs. 
nachos and churros. Prollts went to 
benefit the Marshall College 
Scholarship Fund. 

Vendors in the street fair sold

"In a similar sense," Leventhal 
continued. "I do not personally sup-
port the A.S.P. referendum, but I am 
disappointed to see that while the stu-
dents supported it, they didn't have 
the voter turnout to enact the fee." 

Leventhal added that next year's 
A.S. Council appears to be a diverse 
group, and he hopes to offer Khullar 
advice based on the experience he 
has gathered in the past year. 

"I think that a lot of really good 

Vendors also sold jewelry, T-shirts, 
blankets and other items. Workers 
at one booth performed hair wraps 
along with ear and nose piercing. 

A children's village, featuring 
African American story telling, arts 
and crafts, llama rides and an Astro 
Jump, was also Set up. Children 
participated in face painting, origa-
mi lessons and making clay Fimo 
beads. 

A game area featured various 
games such as Twister, Shoots and 
Ladder and dozens of other board 
games from different countries. A 
biography about each game was 
placed next to the board games to 
educate allendees about the games' 
cultural origin. 

Jonathan Fung, a senior Marshall 
student, said he volunteered at the 
event because he thought the cele-
bration was important. 

"It's important to try to bring 
everyone of all ages together at the

individuals will make up next 
year's council," Leventhal said. "I 
think Tesh is a very capable presi-
dent, and I hope to give him as 
much guidance as I can before he 
starts his term." 

Khullar said that the new A.S. 
Council shou ld set political differ-
ences aside and come together to 
work as a council. 

"I think it's a great group of 
independents, Students First' mem-
bers and Change members," 
Khullar said. "But elections are 
over. We have to throw our political 
beliefs and associations with slates 
out the window." 

Television commercials on two 
local stations were part of the pub-
licity for this year's cultural cele-
bration. Advertising was also done 
in the public libraries, community 
area and local schools. 

Acting Assistant Marshall 
College Dean Diane ' Rouda said 
that she thought this year's ce le-
bration highlight was the chil-
dren ;s village because she thought 
it helped to make the celebration 
more of a community event. 
Rouda said the entire event is part 

'of an effort for community out-
reach . 

"We want to get kids fa'miliar 
and comfortable with the idea of 
college," Rouda said. "We want to 
start them young thinking about 
co llege. Marshall college stu-
dents' involvement in this event 
helps develop them as scholars 
and citizens. It gives students a 
chance to give back to the com-
munity."

Maybe the source is tea, coffee. cola nuts or cocoa

mayhe you haven't. Like cigarettes or alcohol, you 
prohably didn 't like coffee the first time you tasted it , 

but then it happened. You needed it for the first time to stay 
up all night , and a fri end says. "Here, take this, It ' ll help." 

Ahh, caffei ne. the wonder drug. And you' re hooked. 
Thc habit thri ves hcre at UCS D. Jennifer Monatlik, a 

fourth year Marshall student and Grove employee, says cof-
fee helps her get through the day. 

"I love it," Monatlik said . "Coffee gets me 
going and it keeps "1e sane. It allows 
me to communicate with o~ peo-

lates conversation. i find that 
.when I don ' t have coffee during 
the day, I don't really want to 
talk to other people. I don't 
have the energy. I have to 
watch myself, though, because 
if I have too much caffeine, 
thcn it ' ll stop affecting me." 

A study, conducted in San 
Francisco by Kai ser Perma-
nente, of 130,000 Northern 
CaliFornia res idents 
reports that coffee 
drinking may save 
your life. The study 
found fewer suicides 
among coFFee 

drinker~ then among their abstaining counterparts. 
"This is not a tluke finding because our study was very 

large, involved a multiracial population, men, women and 
examined closely numerous factors related to mortality, 
such as alcohol con umption and smoking," cardiologist 
Arthur Klatsky said. 

Caffeine itself is a white, odorless powder. It is essenti al-
ly tasteless, but does have a biller ki ck to it. Barq 's Root ~ 
Beer, for example, "adds it as a tlavoring agent for the sharp~ 
bittcrness." The rcason why decaffeinated coffees ta ·te dif-~

CAFFEINE: 
Causes nervousness, 
excitement, insomnia 
Continued f rom page 11 

Many people report that caffeine 
boosts the energy levels of the con-
sumer, making people feel less 
drowsy, less fatigued and more 
capable of sustained intellectual 
acti vity. Studies have shown, how-
ever, that caffeine decreases reac-
tion time to both visual and auditory 
stimuli. Also, it does not significant-
ly alter numerical reasoning (arith-
metic skills) or short-term memory, 
and due to a shaking effect it can 
dimi nish performance of manual 
tasks that involve delicate muscular 
coordination and accurate timing. 

Recent consumption of more 
then 250 mg of caffeine usually 
results in a range of the symptoms, 
depending on the typical usage of 
the consumer and his or her particu-
lar body chemistry. Restlessness. 
nervousness, excitement, insomnia, 
flushed face, diuresis, ga trointesti-
nal disturbance, muscle twitching, 
rambling flow of thought and 
speech. cardiac arrhuythmia and 
periods of inexhaustabi Iity can all be 
the results of caffeine consumption. 

Caffeine and alcohol are both 
diuretics. which means that they 
increase our body 's liquid output 
and increase dehydration. Drinks 
like coffee, soda and tea won ' t 
relieve thirst or dehydration. Dur-
ing times of stress or heavy athletic 
ac ti vity, be sure to combat the 
effects of coffee and water I<;>ss 
with plenty of juice or water. 

Like adrenaline, which is a stim-
ulant that our bodies produce during 
times of stress, too much caffeine 
can aggravate stress. It isn't wise to 
stop all caffeine consumption during 
final , but- increasing intake can . 

aggravate the body and decrease 
performance. Additionally, alcohol 
is a depressant and can aggravate 
stress and fatigue. Combining heavy 
amounts of caffeine and alcohol 
during times of stress will cause a 
seesaw effect within the body. 

I n terms of women's health, cer-
tain studies have shown that there 
is a link between moderate to 
heavy caffeine consumption (more 
then 340 mg) per day, and a loss of 
calcium absorption in the bones. 
The majority of women do not get 
enough calcium in their diets, and 
this, combined with heavy caffeine 
intake, can lead to brillie bones 
later in life. 

Additionally, although there has 
been no proven link between fertili-
ty and caffeine consumption, doc-
tors caution pregnant women to be 
careful with their caffeine· intake. 
Moderation is always advised when 
consuming any sort of drug during 
pregnancy. In three major studies 
involving more then 15,000 women, 
it was found that there were no birth 
defects associated with caffeine 
consumption, even among the heav-
iest coffee drinkers. Moderate con-
sumption of caffeine does not pre-
di spose expectant mothers to mis-
carriages, or to prderm delivery, nor 
does it cause the fetus to be born 
with a low birth weight. None of the 
studies mentioned anything about 
the long-term effects of caffeine on 
a baby after he or she is born. 

In the end, caffeine is like any-
thing else. It has its up sides and its 
down ides. Coffee breaks relax 
and soothe, prepare us for the rest 
of our day and help us get through 
intense study periods. Soda stimu-
lates and energizes. Tea is associat-
ed with European and Asian culture 
and cuisine. Used in moderation, it 
adds to life. Abused, it is detrimen-
tal LO the body.

PSYCHO THERAPY 
The Holy Wars are re-jought in the freshman dorms 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Staff Wliter 

good old UC San Diego and was 
rooming with two Catholics, a Jew, 
a Greek Orthodox and three other 
varieties of Christian, all of whom 
held fairly dissimilar views. When 
question~d about my own religious 
beliefs, I found myself at a loss. 
After some careful thought I decid-
ed I was undeclared - no panicu-
lar organized religion seemed any 
more appealing than any other. 

Foolishly, I figured that since I 
hadn't picked a team then I was 
neutral and in a position to be more 

were. silting in our common room 
pretty late at night, discussing sex 
which (ironically) seemed an inno-
cent enough topic. From there things 
snow-balled into a full-tledged 
debate about religion that ended 
badly. I wanted to tell them all to ' 
calm down, but I felt like no one was 
listening ... they kept intenupting, 
anxious to make another point. We 
are tottering on the edge of Room-
mate Ruin here at Stewan 416. 

I don ' t think the diary entry 
fully captures the complete melo-

through most of the squabbling (it 
wasn't all about religion ... some of 
it was about personal hygiene or 
borrowed anicles of clothing), but I 
found it was tough to stay neutral 
when I was about five feet away 
from the nearest battle. I felt like a 
very small, insignificant country in 
the middle of a great world war. 

In the middle of the year, I 
looked on unhappily as religion 
also became a source of contention 
between two of my friends who 
had been dating for years. Julie was 

They say there are two things 
you never bring up at the dinner 
table: JXllitics and religion. As far 
as religion ' is concerned, when I 
first got to college I learned that 
debate seemed to crop up constant-
ly, dinner table or no dinner table. It 
took my suite mates and I exactly 
one week before we were saying 
things like, "Please pass the salt ... 
what do you think about God?" 

If being in His club is·going to make my friends 
fight, then I don't want to be a member! 

Another major conflagration 
ignited in May, when one of my 
favorite suitemates, a quiet, even~ 
tempered young lady, converted to 
a branch of Christianity that none 
of us had ever heard of before. 
Only a short while prior to her con-
version, she'd been approached by 
a member of this church in the 
Price Center and invited to allend 
one of its services. All of us were 
concerned about her rapid change 
of faith, particularly since it had 
followed an emotional break-up 
with her boyfriend, and none of us 
felt obliged to keep our opinions to 
ourselves. 

One by one, we cornered her 
and gave her the inquisition that 
eventually put my mellow friend 
on the defensive. I guess openly 
calling someone's religion a cult 
will antagonize just about anyone; 
she stopped listening JXllitely and 
eventually retreated from the 
onslaught by spending less time 
with us and more time with her 
new friends. 

B.C. (before college), I'd never 
spent much time thinking about reli-
gion since I was raised in a reli-
giously ambiguous family (if any of 
my family members have strong 
religious beliefs, then they cenainly 
aren 't sharing them with me). In fact, 
my first encounter with religion was-
n't until after my senior year of high 
school when I brietly dated a Mor-
mon, much to his parents dismay. 

Suddenly, [ got shipped otl to 

open-minded than the average col-
lege student. Unfortunately, I was 
working on the presumption that a 
half-dozen adults could sit around 
and have an intelligent, inoffensive 
discussion about religion. The first 
big Holy War came as a complete 
shock to me. Here 's my diary entry 
from that fateful night. 

Sept. 21 , 1994: The tirst crisis has 
arisen in my suite. Tonight we broke 
out in a major religious debate (big 
mistake), which resulted in hun fed-
ings, tears and a big dilemma. We

hours. Intelligent and inoffensi ve 
tlew right out the window when 
one roommate blurted out, "So 
essentially you're saying that I'm 
going to bum in hell!" Comments 
like that do not tend to pave the 
way for rational thought. 

Although the tension was dif-
fused a little by the next day, this 
was not' an end to the hostility, but 
a harbinger of worse things to 
come.

Christian and Ryan was Jewish. 
Somehow this subject had never 
seemed important during their high 
school relationship. After they'd 
chosen to attend the same college it 
seemed like all they talked about. 
Unable to get past their theolQgical 
differences, eventually the perfect 
couple broke up. I thought their 
choice seemed so unfair; in my 
naive mind religion was supposed 
to bring people toge!her, not keep 
them apart. Why couldn't they just 
agree to disagree? 

Our suite bungled on through 
freshman year, and I eventually 
became so bitter about the animos-
ity that I transferred to my hostility 
toward religion in general. What

PSYCHO: 
Rational discussion

good could ever come out of some- . 
thing that divided people? I don't 
care if there is a God, I decided. If 
being in His club is going to make 
my friends tight, then I don't want 
to be a member! 

I wish I could say that in the 
next four years of my college 
career I saw people become more 
respectfu I (or at least tolerant) of 
each other's lifestyles. If I said that, 
however, I would be lying. Time 
and again I've seen friendships 
jeopardized and romantic relation-
ships destroyed by the Holy Wars. 
I've overheard comments like, "I'd 
hang out with her but she's too 
Christian," or "I could never date 
anyone who'd had sex before." I 
think limiting yourself to social 
contact with only people who think 
in the same way is a crime. 

I went through UCSD with a 
knee-jerk reaction to people who 
brought up the subject of religion. 
It wasn ' t until my tifth and final 
year that I actually befriended 
someone who could carry on a the-
ological discussion without irritat-

ing or offending me. I look at my 
friendship with Christine and I 
wonder how she and I can be so 
close and yet have totally different 
religious beliefs. How is it JXlssible 
for the two of us to avoid the angry 
finger-pointing and condescension 
that seems inevitable in my experi-
ence? 

Perhaps we get along because 
we respect eacti other's opinions. 
We listen tQ what the other person 
has to say, rather than jumping in 
and intenupting. Making our own 
point seems less imponant than lis-
tening to the other person and 
learning about her. 1. don't believe 
in her religion and she knows she 
might never conven me. Yet still 
we take the time to talk to each 
other, and we at least reaffinn our 
own beliefs if nothing else. 

I look back to freshman year, 
when I so painfully discovered that 
we can't all just get along. I think 
about how much that hurts me and 
how angry I get when I see my peers 
divide themselves up into homoge-
neous clicks, rather than appreciat-
ing and seeking out each other's 
diversity. But then I think about my 
friendship with Christine and I feel 
better ... l'm pretty jaded, but I still 
have hope. Maybe someday we can 
put an end to these Holy Wars.

MR. POULTRY 1999 

Usa Huff/ Guardian 
Two weeks ago, a giant chicken swooped down upon UCSD for the better part of Friday afternoon. The perpetrator 
was UCSD's very own Matt Powell , who was manly enough to accept the challenge of Psycho Therapy's Dress Up In 
A Chicken Suit and Pose With Your Professor contest. This is believed to be the first documented case of a UCSD 
student dressing up like a barnyard animal and attending lecture. Witnesses reported that Powell was seen in 
several different classes, including Dr. Gary Snyder's <>-chem lecture in Peterson Hall. Snyder took time out from his 
energetic lecture to pose for a picture, proving that he really does deserve all those Best Teacher awards he gets 
every year. For his efforts, Powell will accompany the Psycho Therapist on a shopping spree at Tower Records.

UCSD is Under the Weather 
MISSING: The absense of Greg Johnson has had an impact on the Tritons 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

Question: What does the office 
of the registrars have to do with a 
golf swing? Answer: Nothing, 
unless you are Greg Johnson. 

Johnson, an integral part of the 
Tri ton golf team, has had his hare 
of registrar bureaucracy. Due to 
some confusion with a passino pass 
grading option, the UCSD golfer 
has spent the past few tournaments 
at the driving range instead of on 
the course. 

Head Coach Mike Wydra said 
that the effects of Johnson '5 ineligi-
bil ity are two-fold: on the score-
board and with team moral. With 
Johnson on the sidelines, UCSD's 
team chemistry and final scores 
have suffe red. 

Despite Johnson's absence, the 
Tri tons have still turned in some 
strong scores. Last week, Wydra's 
squad played in two matches, one 
last Wednesday at Torrey Pines and 
one las t Thursday at Red Hill 
Count ry Club in Cucamonga. In 
Wednesday 's match, 
played under harsh con-
ditions on Torrey 
Pines ' South Cour e, 
the Tritons turned in a 
team total 333, which 
was 14 strokes off the 
pace. UCSD improved the 
following day in Cucamonga as 
the team turned in a respectable 
310 - just one stroke shy of the 
Win .

perfect day at Torrey Pines. It was "The course played different

the ball. somehow stayed out 
and the game was a draw, a 
favorable result for UCSD. 

In the last game of the day, 
the Tritons faced off against the 
vaunted Bruins. The full -schol-
arshipped team is perennially 
one of the nation's best. They 
did get a 3-0 resuli over UCSD, 
but il could very easily have 
been a much ditTerent game. 

The Bruins opened the match 
aggressively, and the Tritons 
were on their heels. But soon, 
the Tritons shook off the jitters 
and found out that UCLA was in 
fact mortal. However, they also 
found out how good they were 
when the Bruins quickly struck a 
spectacular goal midway 
through the first half. 

UCSD battled back and had 
some chances. Rob Benowicz 
had an unbelievable bicycle 
kick cross off a comer kick that 
McBride just missed pUlling 
away. The first half ended with 
UCLA up, 1-0. 

In the second half, the Bruins 
tacked on two more goals. 
However, they were both on 
very controversial calls, includ-. 
ing a missed offside call that 
was remarkably bad and that 
gave the Bruins their third goal. 

Despite the seemingly poor 
result, the Tritons did play well 
against UCLA. It was a good 
weekend f9r UCSD, and they 
continue to build toward a suc-
cessful season next fall .

LIBATIONS: 
Liquor Box: A 
team for the ages? 
C ...... edtre. ..... 2O 
with a gimpy leg and a cannon 
for an arm. 

We had third base covered 
by a convened center fielder 
known for his tendency to 
swing for the fences and the out-
field consisted of two quick Del 
Mar-lians with speed and a big 
brawny error-prone right-fielder 
play'ing with a first-baseman's 
glove. The battery featured our 
very own crafty little O-chemer 
Greg Maddux, playing his only 
1M spon of the year, throwing 
the ball to the Round Mound of 
Defensive Renown backstop 
who always keeps an eye out for 
foul-tips. 

A team for the ages, I 
thought to myself as we battled 
through the innings. It was hard 
to tell if we were more lacking 
in defense or offense, but we 
were making as many great 
plays as we made bad ones. In 
this spring training of softball, I 
could see we had a lot of poten-
tial. In the end, our hopes at vic-
tory died when we stranded a 
runner at third, down 10-9 in the 
top of the last inning. 

Not one to harp on missed 
chances, we all agreed that the 
best thing to do was drown our 
sorrows in a big frothy glass of 
the Suds. It seems the best thing 
about softball is win or lose, 
there always a good excuse (or 
drinking. I just hope we are all 
ready for indoor soccer on 
Tuesday.

Tritons Continue to Thrive 
RULERS: Four men placed in the top eight in the SOOO-meters 
By Saul SherIdan 
Senior Staff Writer 

You don' t need to tell anyone on the 
UCSD track and field team what time it is. 
This Saturday was a definite reminder to 
everyone on the team that the season is 
winding down, and that now was not 
the time f~r anyone to start lelling 
up. 

The California-Nevada 
Championships are a mere two 
weeks away, and the conference 
championships just two weeks after 
that. For the UC San Diego track and fi eld 
team, now was not the time to start letting 
up. This weekend as the Tritons hosted the 
Tri ton Invitational at RIMAC Field, the 
Tri tons showed no sign of lell ing up as they 
continued on in their season of excellence. 

The Tritons got an impressive perfor· 
mances from Jessica Shugart and Erin 
$elim. Shugart placed second in the 400· 
meters with a time of 58.04 seconds, the 
second fastest time in school history. Selim 
placed second in both of her heats in the 
400- and 200-meters. 

Among the top performers on the men's 
side was Andrew Gonzalez, who placed fi rst 
in the men's 100-meters with a season hest 
time of 11 .13 seconds. 

"I' m really happy wi th my time because 
I had been injured th is season," Gonzalez 
said. "This meet was a breakthrough for me 
personally at getting back to where I was 
last year." 

Also having a great day for the Tritons 
was James Freeman. Freeman placed sec-

ond in the II O-meter hurdles with a time of 
14.91 seconds, second best in school hislo, 
ry. 

Perhaps the most dominating perfor· 
mance on the day by the Tritons was in the 

men's 5()()()-meter race. James 
Nielsen led the way with a 

impressive time of 14:49.86. ' 
Coming in not fa r behind 
him was Steve Varnell , who 
placed fourth in the event. 

In fact, UCSD runners turned 
in four of the top eight perfor-

mances in the event. Kevin 
Prindiville and Franzwa Achie came in sixth 
and eighth, respecti vely, to round out the 
Tritons dominance in the event. 

The runners were not the only ones to 
have success. The Triton throwers also had a 
huge weekend. Mall Seefeld continued his 
great season with a fir t-place finish in the 
hammer throw with a throw of 176'5". Not 
far behind him was Christopher Swartz, 
whose personal best throw of 138 '9" in the 
hammer was good enough for third overall. 

"Our throwers are some of the best 
throwers in our conference and in Division 
m," Swartz said. "And I th ink th is Saturday 
we proved it." 

On the women's side, freshman Ti na 
Summers threw a personal best 138' 10" in 
the hammer throw to claim second . . 
Coming in right behind her was Christi 
Norton, who threw the hammer 137'4" for 
third place honors. In the javelin, Amy Olin 
was able to earn sixth in the event with a 
throw of 104'5." 

UCSD Comes Up Empty 
SKUNKED: Cal Lu pitcher hurled a no-hitter against the Tritons 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

On any sports team, there are always 
some positions that matter more than others. 
In hockey, you' ll never win a game wi lhout 
a goa lie who can block shots, and in . 
basketball a dominant center can 
make opponent cringe. Yet no 
single player can contro l a game 
more than a dominant start ing 
pitcher. Even if a team has 
momentum, a great pitcher can 
tear through a lineup like a buzz 
saw, methodica lly erasing any chance 
of victory. The UCSD men's baseball team 
found this out fi rst-hand last Saturday when 
it traveled to Cali fornia Lutheran Universi ty 
in Thousand Oaks. 

Start ing for the Kingsmen was pitcher 
Tom Canale and he certainly had his good 

- stuff going. The Tri ton offense, which had 
been so ali ve in Thursday's 5·6 loss to Poi nt 
Lorna Nazarene Uni versi ty, sudd('nly went 
dead. To hi s credit , Canale pitched a gem as 
he no·hil the Tri ton en roule to a 1-0 victo· 
ry. 

A no·hitter is always difficult to swallow, 
but this game was part icularly hard to bear 
because UCS D starter John Gheri ni pitChed 
so well himself. The eight-inning complete 
game was the second for Gherin i th is year. 
He allowed only 5 hits and no earned runs, 
walking two and stri king out two, ye t took 
the loss because of Canale's heroics. 

The game was scoreless until the bottom 
of the sixth when Cal Lu's second baseman 
got aboard because of an inlield error. The 

.. 

Kingsmen then sacri fi ced him to second and 
he advanced to third on an infi eld hit to the 
short top. After the runner on firs t stole sec-
ond, the Tritons intent ionally walked the 
No. 3 batter to load the bases and attempt 

the force play at home. The attempt 
was unsuccessful as Cal Lu left-
fie lder Brian Malchow grounded 

out deep to the second base-
man forthe game's only RBI. 

UCSD's best chance came 
in the top of the ninlh with 

Canale ti ring. The Ki ngsmcn pi tch-
er had only faced one batter over the 

mi nimu m, but walked two in the li nal 
inning. With 2 outs and the game-wi nn ing 
run on first, UCSD still couldn't break 
through. Canale reached back and tallied his 
10th strikeout to end the match and preserve 
the no·hi tter. 

The loss dropped UCSD's record to 14-
12 on the year and dampened its playoff 
hopes. It was the second difficult loss in a 
row 'fo r the Tri tons following the game in 
Point Lorna on Thursday. 

UCSD had taken a 5-1 lead into Ihe bot-
!Om of the sixth, but the Crusaders clawed 
their way back. PL U scored 3 runs in the 
bottom of the sixth to bri ng it within a run. 
Both teams then went scoreless for a couple 
innings until the bottom of the ninth. Try as 
it might , UCSD cou ldn't hold Ihe slim 5-4 
lead as reliever Brian Hinson gave up 2 ru ns 
and took the loss. 

Next up fo r the Tritons is a game agai nst 
Southern California College in Costa Mesa, 
played th is afternoon.

"Considering State is a domi-

"The only people who could

While the men' IlQvice eisht 
seems to be off and running with 
the competit ion, Liu said the men's 
varsity eight still has some work to 
do if they plan to fair well at the 
Cali fo rn ia State Championships

"We had a bad week last week," 
Liu said . "We made some major 
changes this week, and I think 
we' re goi ng in the right di rection.

mendable day as well. Though they 
did not take home the champi-

behind State and in front of USD 
was a great result .

ished just over 12 seconds off 
State's winning time of 6:46.67 in 
the 2000-meter race and over two 
secon~s in front of third-place

Greed 
Bucket 
Jake Gordon 
Sears Cup, Liquor 
Box and Libations 

Of the many rec reati onal 
sports that exist, there is none 
more tailored to the fat , slow 
American working man than the 
great game of softball. Thus 
there is no game better for the 
intrepid Guardian sports tafT to 
play. In the working world, sim-
ply the fact that the amount of 
beer cans consumed can usually 
exceed the amount of innings 
played makes softball a worth-
while endeavor. Yet the game 
itself is exciting enough . 

Of course, UCSD intramu-
rals (the greatest department on 
campus) offers this wonderful 
sport and I signed my friends 
and I up to playas the now-infa-
mous Liquor Box. Our squad 
had claimed a strangle-hold on 
the top spot in the unofficial 
Intramural Sears Cup Poll with 
wins in both men's and co-ed 
soccer and we needed to uphold 
our ranking and our reputations. 

So on Sunday afternoon , wc 
somehow managed to drag our-
selves out of the slovenly hovel 
that is our house and to RIMAC 
Field. (This is no easy task, 
mind you. To escape our hostel 
de University City, you must 
make your way through the 
piles of empty 12-pack contain-
ers, pizza boxes, used styro-
foam food containers and last 
week's sports sections.) 

Suffice to say, we made it 
and we were a motley crew. 
Most of us had our bloodshot 
eyes half clo ed as we ·taggered 
through warm-ups, the result of 
t.oo much drinking the night 
before. Last season at this time, 
we were playing in the AAA 
league, the best lhere is. Yet, 
getting the crap kicked out of us 
every week seemed to lose ;t 's 
luster toward the end of the year 
and this season we had su ITi -
cientl y sand-bagged into the 
lowest di vision, A. 
Unfortunately, from the looks of 
our opponents, we weren' t the 
only ones. Since I was a victim 
of an unfortunate Muir League 
basketball ankle-snapping, I 
eagerly took on sole managerial 
dutie for the match. As our 
team took the fi eld, I mused 
about at the rag- tag bunch that 
made up this modem-day Bad 

ews Bears. 
At first base was the tall , 

rangy Iri hman known as much 
for his pallid complexion as for 
his defensive skills and big bat. 
Manning second base was the 
old ironman father-fi gure of the 
squad, limbering his old bones 
up for his 27lh consecutive soft -
ball season, complaining ab ut 
hi rheumatism and arthriti s. 
Shortstop was our most solid 
position, covered by a short, 
angry Italian transfer student

UCSD Takes on UCLA, SDSU 
NO JOKE: The men's soccer team challenged the Bruins and the Aztecs 
By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

This is not another sick prank 
by the incredibly attraclive 
Guardian sports staff: UCLA 
and San Diego State actu-
ally brought their men 's 
soccer squads to 
RIMAC for spring 
games 
UCSD 
Saturday. 

against 
last 

Many will al 0 consider the 
fact that the Tritons matched up 
very well with their Division I 
counterparts a joke as well , but it 
was the truth. UCSD had a very 
strong showing on Saturday, draw-
ing with SDSU 0-0 and losing, 3-0, 

to the Bruins. 
UCLA and the Aztecs also faced 

off against each other and they tied, 
0-0. 

This spring round-robin event 
wi" not go onto any school's 

record books, as all three 
teams just wanted to 
get some work done 
in the offseason. 
However, all three 

teams had almost a" 
of their starters and the 

matches were refereed by sanc-
tioned officials. The major differ-
ence between these spring games 
and matches thal would be held 
during the regular season was that 
the halves only lasted 35 minutes 

apiece instead of the usual 45. 
UCSD began the day with a bat-

tle against their cross-town rivals, 
SDSU. The Aztecs are a bona-fi.de 
Division I team, but they did not 
have much form against lhe 
Tritons. UCSD took the game to 
the Aztecs and was never over-
matched. 

In fact , the Tritons should have 
won the game. Cameron Adams 
had a chance that just missed 
pUlling UCSD ahead. Doug 
McBride had perhaps the best 
chance of the match, however, late 
in the game. He blasted a ball on 
goal that rattled off one post and 
almo t banked in off the other. But

T hey say that in real life there arc no second chances. Once you've blown it , you ve just 
got to deal with it. But in the 
world of sports, sometimes 
there are second chances. 

The members of the men 's 
varsity eight, who were disap-
pointed with their San Diego 
Crew Classic showing held on 
March 27-28, had a chance for 
redemption last Saturday at the 
San Diego City Championships 
held in West Mis ion Bay. And 
redemption was served. 

The varsity eight knew it was 
a better boat than the sixth-placc 
spot it earned at the Classic, and 
the Tritons proved it on 
Saturday against local rival s 
San Diego State University and 
the University of San Diego. 

The varsity eight took first 
place in this three-way champi-
onship, by beating the second-
place squad from USD by a boat 
length and the third place Aztec 
crew by three boat lengths. The 
Tritons fini shed the 2000-meter 
course in 6:05 .88. The USD 
Torreos came in at just under a 
second slower than the Tritons 
with a time of 6:06.35. 

This win, coupled with a win 
from the men 's novice eight and 
a second-place finish in the 
men's open four, earned the 
UCSD men their third consecu-
tive city championship and 
another year of bragging rights 
over the second-place Torreos 
and the third-place Aztecs. 

Though the men 's team was 
happy to remain at the top in 
San Diego, it was a race it 
almost eXJ'Ccled to win. 

Team Captain Wayne Liu 
said that the men's team was 
confident it could win this 
regatta again. 

"This is our third win in a 
row," Liu said. "We knew we' re 
a bigger and faster team than
