Regents approve eligibility changes 
New grade rules to most affect minority applicants 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

After three hours of emotion-
al debate, the UC Board of 
Regents voted in favor of tight-
ening eligibility requirements for 
students applying to the universi-
ty. The decision marked the first 
time in more than two decades 
that the regents cut the number 
of students who meet the univer-
sity' minimum standards. 

Under the plan, which will 
first affect students entering the 
university in the fall of 2007, 
high school seniors will need a . 
minimum GPA of 3.0 to be guar-
anteed a spot on a UC campus, 
up from the current minimum of 
2.8. 

The 16-4 vote in favor of the 
plan came more than two months 
after the regents first took up the 
issue inJuly. They postponed the 
final decision after critiL ques-
tioned the statistics behind the 
proposal and charged that it 
would disproportionately hurt 
underrepresented students. 

"There is no doubt in my 
mind that this proposal will have 
long-term adverse implications 
for many students," said Jack 
O'Connell, the state's superin-
tendent of education and an ex-

officio regent. "This is another 
hurdle that we're going to be 
putting [in front] of these stu-
dents; it's another roadblock for 
opportuni ty." 

Two other ex-officio members 
of the board, Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante and State Assembly 
Speaker Fabian Nuiiez, also 

. opposed the plan. Both argued 
that the new rules, which the 
university estimates will remove 
750 students from the UC eligi-
bility pool, would disproportion-
ately hurt ethnic minorities, poor 
students and rural schools -
groups which are already under-
represented at the system's cam-
puses. 

Black students wi ll feel the 
most severe impact under the 
new rules, as more than one out 
of every five currently eligible 
students will lose their ability to 
apply to the university as a com-
bined re ult of eligibility changes 
passed over the last two months. 

However, faculty members 
who crafted the proposal said it 
represented the most equitable 
solution out of the more than 
200 considered by their commit-
tee. 

"Student access to the 
University of California is crucial 
to the future of the state, and

tightening our eligibi lity stan-
dards is a difficult thing to do," 
said George Blumenthal, chair of 
the systemwide Academic 
Council. "Our faculty worked in 
a very committed fashion to 
develop a plan that would 
emphasize academic achievement 
in high school, have the least 
negative impact on anyone 
demographic group and provide 
adequate notice of the changes to 
students." 

The regents first asked the 
faculty in May to find ways to cut 
the number of eligible students 
after a statewide report found 
that nearly 14.4 percent of 
seniors met the university'S mini-
mum requirements . Under the 
1960 Master Plan of Education, a 
blueprint for the sta te's higher 
education y tem, the university 
is supposed to choose students 
from the top eighth of each year's 
graduating class. However, crit-
ics have questioned the accuracy 
of the study, pointing to its large 
margin of error. 

Under "procedural changes" 
the regents approved in July, the 
number of eligible students fell 
to 13 percent. With the new GPA 
requirements, the university

Old house should

Staff Writer 

The University of 
California has agreed to pay 
56,500 a month for Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox's new La Jolla 
home under a two-year lease 
signed by the university. 
Administrators plan to have the 
residence serve as a temporary 
home for Fox while they decide 
whether to repair or rebuild 
University House, a university-
owned property that has 
housed chancellors since the 
1950s in addition to being a 
venue for major events. 

Architects commissioned by 
UC President Robert C. 
Dynes, the campus' previous 
chancellor, found the property 
uninhabitable last spring, cit-
ing serious problems that 
included erosion, improper 
drainage and physical deterio-
ration.

Campus crime up 16 percent 
during 2003, annual study says 

Reported sexual assaults hit five-year high, 
bike thefts rose 135 percent in 2003 

. By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

An annual report of crimes at 
UC campuses showed total crime 
at UCSD increased 16 percent in 
2003, with the number of bike 
thefts more than doubling. The 
most serious violent crimes, includ-
ing robbery and aggravated assault, 
also posted a 75-percent gain. 

"I think a lot of [the increase] 
can be attributed to the fact that 
the campus is growing," said 
Kristen McCollough, a crime 
prevention officer with the 
UCSD Police Department. 
"We've got more people, so we've 
got more opportunities for this to 
happen."

campus crime during 2003, mea-
sure only seven offenses, which are 
known together as the FBI crime . 
index and are used as a gauge that 
models changes in overall volume 
and rates of illegal misconduct. 

Because the rate takes so few 
crimes into account - crimes that 
occur so infrequently at the univer-
sity - the year-to-year change may 
be insignificant, said Mary Garcia, 
the department's records and com-
munications manager. For example, 
the jump in violent crimes repre-
sents an increase of only three 
offenses from the year before, she 
said, hardly enough to represent a 
meaningful trend.

I BRIEFLY 
Group opposes Connerly 

reappointment 
A coalition of affirmative action supporters, 

speaking during the public input session at 
the September 22 UC Board of Regents 
meeting. told the regents that it had collected 
more than 15,000 signatures on a petition 
objecting to the reappointment of Regent 
Ward Connerly. 

Approximately half a dozen speakers from 
the group Sy Any Means Necessary made 
emotional statements to the regents, at times 
yelling over the directions given, by the board's 
secretary. Connerly walked out of the meeting 
several minutes after the group began speak-
ing. with members of the audience cheering. 

Members of the group called Connerly an 
'Uncle Tom" and likened him to segregationist 
presidential candidate George Wallace. 

Connerly, a black bUSinessman, was a 
main backer of Proposition 209, which 
banned the use of racial preferences in the 
st~te, and supported last year's failed effort to 
prohibit the state of California from collecting 
data on race. 

Originally appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson, 
Connerly's 12-year term on the board will end 
in March. 

Chancellor Fox to host 
online conversation 

UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox will hold 
a one-hour online chat with students and 
members of the press on Sept 29. 

Those who part icipate in the live 
forum will be able to ask questions and 
receive "direct, personal feedback,' 
according to a university statement. The 
chat follows Fox's impromptu conversa-
tions with students as they moved into 
campus housing and a cookie distribution 
during Welcome Week. 

The chat will begin at 4 p.m. at

Nonprofit urges youth to 
pledge sex with voters 

In an effort to increase turnout among 
young voters, a nonpartisan group led by 
recent college graduates has launched a cam-
paign to link voting and sex. 

Spokeswoman Michelle Collins said the 
goal of the campaign, called Votergasm, is to 
turn Election Day into "an erotic national 
youth festival, an orgy of democracy and civic 
participation."

The nonprofit group says it wants to reverse 
two trends: "low voting rates among young 
people and unacceptaoly low rates of youth 
sexual activity." 

To encourage election-night sex on cam-
puses, the group is planning to launch an 
advertising campaign in college newspapers in 
swing states. 

Through the campaign's Web site, students 
can pledge to abstain from having sex with 
nonvoters for various periods of time. To 
pledge at the highest "American Hero" level, 
they have to promise "have sex with a voter on 
election night and withhold sex from nonvoters 
for the next fou r years." 

Report gives state -8- grade 
for college affordability 

Despite improvement over the last decade, 
California still has work to do in improving 
affordability of its higher education, a new 
report card has found. 

Overall, the National Center for Public Policy 
and Higher Education awarded the state a 
grade of "S" for college costs. 

Even though community colleges offer 
poor students low-priced access to a college 
education, families in California spend a larg-
er share of family income on higher educa-
tion costs than the best-performing states, 
the study found. However, the center noted 
that the share of income spent on college 
has decreased over the last decade, in part 
thanks to the state's commitment to provide 
financial aid programs to needy students, it 
said. 

In addition, the report card gave the state 
an "A" grade for the rate of college enrollment 
among its students, attainment of degrees and 
civic participation. 

Davis law student confirmed 
as student regent 

The UC Soard of Regents has approved the 
appointment of a second-year UC Davis law " 
student to serve as the student member of the 
goveming body for the 2005-06 academic 
year. 

Adam Rosenthal, a 25-year~ld UCLA grad-
uate, will begin attending meetings during the 
current year but will not participate in regent 
votes. 

Rosenthal cited costs of higher education, 
diversity on UC campuses and detenmining the 
role of the university in managing the 
Department of Energy's national laboratories 
as the priorities during his tenure. 

He will succeed UCLA graduate student 
Jodi Anderson, the current student regent.

"There were fundamental 
problems (with University 
House]," said Vice Chancellor 
for Enernal Affairs James M. 
Langley. "I think all low-cost 
solutions to keep it habitable 
have been tried. Only fundamen-
tal work will put the house in a 
proper living situation. It's clear 
that something does need to be 
done." 

Over the summer, Dynes 
commissioned a work group ' to 
examine the property's problems 
and advise the UC Office of the 
President on how best to solve 
them, according to Donald 
Tuzin, a UCSD professor of 
anthropology and head of the 
campus' Academic Senate. Turin 
served on the committee that 
made recommendations for the 
property. 

In a repon, the group recom-
mended that University House be 
demolished and rebuilt, but only if 
enough private money can be 
raised by January 2005. 

If Dynes decides to follow the 
group's recommendation, the pro-
ject would take at least two years 
and cost OYer S7 million, said Brad 
Hayward, UCOP's director of 
communications. 

Instead of taxpayer funds, the 
university plans to use don:-.tions 
to fund the reconstruction, 
according to Hayward. 

"The university expects finan-
cial support for this," he said. "It's 
not just a facility that houses the 
chancellor. It's really a campus 
facility ... If Itbe project cannot be

GPA hike will preserve standards 
Regents must ensure eligibility change has desired effect 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A5 classes started on Sept. 23, 
the University of California's gov-
erning board sweated, fretted and 
finally voted, 16-4, to raise the 
minimum GPA for UC admission 
from 2.8 to 3.0. In an effort to 
avoid a scramble to meet the new 
stan.dards, the change won't take 
effect until fall of 2007. 

To the average UCSD student, 
accepted with a 4 .1 GPA, the 
change sounds minor and incon-
sequential. But the tightening of 
admissions standards is enough to 
prevent approximately 750 more 
students a year from being admit-
ted to the University of 
California. Unfortunately, the 
university must accept the reality 
of the budget situation and devote 
its increasingly limited resources 
to the students it is mandated to 
serve. 

The rationale behind the GPA 
hike was simple. According to the 
California Master Plan for 
Education, the top 12 .5 percent of 
the state's high school graduates 
should be eligible for UC admis-
sion. But a study released in May 
reported that 14.4 percent of high 
school graduates are actually eligi-
ble under the university'S current 
GPA standards. 

In short, according to the 
study, the university is accepting 
too many students, and it doesn't 
have the resources to provide all 
of these students with the caliber 
of education they expect. And, if 
those involved in making the deci-
sion did their math correctly, rais-
ing the minimum GPA to 3.0 will 
eliminate the 750 or so students 
who fell outside the · top 12.5 per-
cent group. 

Opponents of the change in eli-
gibility requirements have two 
major complaints. First, many say 
that the original study's methodol-
ogy was questionable and its esti-
mates crude. As reported in the 
Sept. 21 issue of the GlUlrJian, 
retired UC Berkeley physicist 
Charles Schwartz told the UC 
Board of Regents that the study 
had such a high potential for error, 
it was uncertain whether the GPA 
hike was needed to bring eligibility 
down to 12.5 percent. 

The potential effects of the hike 
are also under scrutiny. The 
regents, and especially UC 

President Robert C. Dynes, realize 
that the chanre in eligibility 
requirements wit no doubt need to 
be adjusted and its effects studied. 
In a Sept. 23 San Frllmisro Chronicle 
article about the GPA hike, Dynes 
said that the regents plan to re-
examine the changes once the 
effects "play out." 

Further, a Sept. 24 article in 
UC Berkeley's Daily C"Ii/f1nlitm 
reported that Gerald Parsley, the 
chairman of the Board of Regents, 
said that the new GPA require-
ments were "subject to changes 
and readjustments over the nen 

two years." Naturally it would be 
unacceptable for the eligibility 
requirements to be changed based 
on flawed data, and it's imperative 
- and likely - that the Regents 
will fulfill their promise of making 
sure the eligibility change has the 
intended effect. 

Many vocal opponents of the 
hike focus on the 750 students who 
will be denied admission based on 
the new requirements. They point 
out that since those students are 
bound to be disproportionately 
black and Latino, denying them 
admission will harm the university's 

rua-~ 
racial diversity. That's an unfortu-
narc consequence of a necessary 
move - tightening admissions 
standards in response to a greater 
number of highly qualified stu-
dents. 

It is sad that the first students 
to be denied admission to the uni-
versity are those already the most 
underrepresenrcd in the UC sys-
tem, but that implies a problem at 
the primary and secondary insti-
tutions these students attend, not 
one with the university's admis-
sions standards. In other words, 
these minority students are 

underperforming because they are 
locked into poor, underperform-
ing schools. It is not the universi-
ty's job to deny their deficient 
educations by accepting them; 
rather, it's everyone's job to bring 
primary and secondary schools up 
to speed. 

Yes, this change in admissions 
requirements is linked to funda-
mental problems with California's 
education system. But those con-
cerned with racial equality in edu-
cation and diversity at the univer-
sity level need to realize that the 
university can't make up for all 
the flaws in the educational sys-
tem that manifest themselves in 
lower GPA5 for minority stu-
dents. 

At the end of the day, the uni-
versity won't solve any problems by 
admitting more students than the 
system can handle; it will only 
strain the university's resources and 
reduce the quality of a UC educa-
tion. 

Regent Sherry Lansing cut to 
the heart of the issue when she 
said, "We are in this position 
because we don't have the money. 
If we start to accept a higher level 
of students that are coming to this 
university, they will find that the 
quality of their education will slip 
greatly." 

The University of California, 
while a public system, is designed 
to take the cream of the crop of 
California's students. The hlle 
between a good student and an 
exceUent student needs to be 
drawn somewhere, and the line 
has simply been redrawn from a 
2.8 GPA to a 3.0 GPA. The 
important basis of that decision -
that the university has a duty to 
accept the top 12.S percent of 
California's high school graduates 
- hasn't changed. 

And let's not forget that if a stu-
dent can't manage a B (1.0) average 
in high school, they're probably 
better-suited for the California 
State Univenity or. community 
college systems anyway. Denying 
students 'admission to the 
University of California is dis-
heartening, but when it's done on 
the basis of very clear admissions 
standards, it hardly signals a gross 
injustice. Instead, in an unfortu-
nate reminder that the uniyersity 
has limited resources and can only 
educate a limited number of stu-
dents. 

University doing everything possible to a4mit students 
Budget reductions make increased enrollment growth impossible for university 

By KELLY GiLlEII' 
Staff Writer 

These days, getting money 
from the state seems as hard as 
finding a good party on campus 
as, so the UC Board of Regents 
deserve kudos for extracting an 
extra $12 million from Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's initial 
budget plan. The University of 
California will put the money 
toward offering four-year enroll-
ment to students who had accept-
ed a "guaranteed transfer option" 
at UC campuses. 

Those students were previously 
told that they were qualified to be 

in the uc system, but were unable 
to receive funding due to budget 
shortages, and would be granted 
enrollment after spending twO 
years at a community college. 

With a little extra money to 
spend, the university is making a 
commendable choice in allowing 
more students to attend a uc cam-
pus and benefit from a higher qual-
ity of education for their first two 
years of college. Students undoubt-
edly benefit from attending the t0d. 
research universities in the worl , 
with better facilities, more class-
rooms and top professors. 

Yet even with the unexpected 
funding, the university was unable 

to offer enrollment to all students 
originally offered the GTO; the

a commendable choice in

" 

regents chose to grant freshman 
enrollment only to students who 
accepted the GTO. 

Opponents of the university's 
decision, including Assemblyman 
Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), con-
tend that the UC system slighted 
students who did not originally 
accept the GTO offer. 

"I'm disappointed that UC is 
not fully honoring its declared 
commitment to the legislature and 
to these students," Sirnitian said. 
"These kids were told they would 
have been accepted but for • lack of 
funds. The fund, have been 
restored and the ldds are still being 
denied admissions to (overcrowded 

campuses)." 
Simitian has called for state 

hearings this month to further 
scrutinize the issue, bu~ the reality 
of the situation is that despirc the 
extra money, the university is still 
underfunded. 

With the stark reductions to 
the univenity's state funding, it's 
unrealistic to expect that all S ,000 
students originall)' offered the 
GTO could be sufficiently fund-
ed; there had to be some IOrt of 
line to draw u far u who can 
receive funding. The students

UCSD is a terrific institution. 

The caliber of students, faculty and 
staff arc more than any administra-
tor could hope to be working with. ., llIAN VIGA 

Senior Stiff Writer 
Two years md $60 million in 

the making, the Estancia LaJoUa 
Spa and Hotel is a marvel of 
modern luxury. With its exclu-
sive beauty treatments, cushy 
accommodations, and proximity 
to Torrey Pines Golf Course, the 
Estancia is a perfect getaway for 
the man on the go with money to 
bum. It also happens to be built 
on . land belonging to a public 
university. 

With mounting concerns over 
California's budget crisis and the 
Univenity of California's spec-
tacular failure managing Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, the 
problem of finding other sources 
of income for the university has 
become more and more of a 
prlli>lem in recent years. To 
solve this problem, the universi-
ty decided to develop a 
"Conference Center Hotel 
Complell- on a parcel of their 
land jutting out toward the 
coastline just east of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College. 

A5 far as money is concerned, 
the university should not run 
into any problems: it gets 
approomately an 8.5% cut of the 
profits from the luxurious facials 
and S200-plus per-night hotel 
rooms at the complex, estimated 
to be along the lines of $600,000 
per year. This'seems like sound 
financial judgment, until you 
compare it to the millions of dol-
lars received by legitimate uni-
versity research operations. 

On the land now occupied by 
debutantes, a decent-sized sci-

ence or engineering complex 
could be erected, similu to the 
Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. That', not to say 
that a new science and engineer-
ing facility is the best choice for 
UCSD's traditionally unbalanced 
curriculum, but it sure makes a 
lot more financial sense than a 
hotel, especially considering that 
Jacobs School of Engineering 
pulled in a cool S 110 million in

space and student 

gathering places are 
razed to make way 
for new research 
buildings, yet the

donations and grants last year. 

Yet even if you neglect this 
gross financial blunder, there is a 
greater issue at stalte here for the 
future of the University of 
California. Whose university is 
thisP 

. .UCSD was originally con-
ceived and funded as a service to 
the taxpayers of California to 
educate their children, but that 
of course went right out the win-
dow in favor of a research-ori-

ented philosophy training the 
technicians of the future to work 
for the university'S current spon-
son. In terms of undergraduate 
student experience, this is barely 
admissible considering the 
wealth of experience aspiring sci-
entists can glean while keeping 
such close ties to industry. Of 
course, this "hard research" phi-
losophy doesn't do our humani-
ties programs any favors. 

Yet what happens when even 
research is pushed aside for 
crude financial goals? What 
message is UCSD sending to its 
faculty and students when pre-
cious parking space and student 
gathering places are razed to 
make way for new research 
buildings, yet the "untouched" 
land is saved for a luxury resort? 

What priorities arc UCSD 
officials prescribing to when said 
hotel is handed a no-qucstions-
asked 65-year lease, while stu-
dents and faculty are forced to 
viciously fight every three 
months over a small number of 
lecture spaces? 

UCSD tends to concentrate 
on short lengths of time, such as 
the extra lecture time which can 
be squeezed into a day by short-
ening passing periods to ten 
minutes in 2002. Or by denying 
some of the most talented pro-
fessors at this university tenure 
so that they may be fired at will . 
You know, short-term concerns. 

But even if UCSD faculty are 
somewhat slighted by the 
Estancia. students by far bear the

Editor: 
Thank you for focusing so much 

of your Sept. 21 issue on my arrival 
as UCSD's new chancellor and the 
myriad of challenges I face in that 
role. I enjoyed reading the diverse 
and thoughtful perspectives on 
what my top priorities as chancel-
lor should be and would like noth-
ing more than to continue to have 
an open dialogue with students on 
these issues. 

I agrcc with your writers who 
concluded that some of my top pri-
orities should be generating new 
sources of revenue in the face of 
shrinking state funds for higher 
education, increasing campus 
diversity and enhancing the quality 
of studf:nt life. These are all top 
priorities for me and my vision for 
UCSD. As mentioned in the pro-
file by G1umJUm Associate News 
Editor Lisa Malt, as a result of the 
recent strategic planning retreat I 
held with the campus leadership, 
we have already taken steps toward 
addressing some of these issues. 

I am proud to have been chosen 
as UCSD's new leader and look 
forward to working with students, 
faculty and staff to reach our mutu-
al goals. 

An open dialogue with· UCSD 
students is essential to reaching 
our goals for the campus and, 
therefore, I would like to invite all 
interested students to participarc 
in an online chat Sept. 29 from 4 
p.m. to 5 p.m. This online "Chat 
with the ChanceUor" is an oppor-
tunity for students to send in ques-
tions they want to discuss and 
receive responses from me in 
"real" time.l think this online chat 
wiD be both fun and informative. I 
encourage all those interested in 
the future of our campus to join

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, SEPTatB Z7, Zoot 

UCSD student in Japan makes pilgrimage to Nintendo 
Columnist shares experiences studying abroad in the Far East 

Lost in 1. Translation 
Daniel Watts 

N intendo Corporation, Ltd. 's headquarters are my holy land. That hallowed 
ground in Kyoto, Japan is to f11e 
what Mecca is to Muslims, what 
the Vatican is to Catholics, what 
New Amsterdam's red light district 
is to potheads. I won't deny it: the 
pilgrimage to Nintendo's corpo-
rate office building is the reason I 
came to Japan as a student for a 
quarter. 

After spending the first eight 
hours. of Sept. 17 touring Shinto 
shrines and Buddhist temples -
fascinating in themselves - I 
convinced two of our Japanese 
student guides to lead a party of 
eight fellow UC students to pay 
tribute at Nintendo's gates. At the 
Japanese consulate general in San 
Francisco, I had earlier looked up 
Nintendo's phone number and 
address in a Kyoto telephone 
directory. But when our guides 

Taro and Miho (pronounced like 
the milk tea flavor and the 
Spanish word for "my son," 
respectively) inquired at the 
information desk near the subway 
station, they discovered that my 
information was wrong; 
Nintendo moved their offices in 
2002. 

An American clerk would've 
laughed at me, the hapless foreign-
er who can't speak the language, 
and told me to find a newer phone 
book. But I'm not in America, I'm 
in]apan -land of excessive polite-
ness and refined customer service, 
where store clerks don't just greet 
you at the door, a la Wal Mart, but 
actually sing you a "welcome" song 
as they stock the shelves and sweep 
the floors. 

True to form, this helpful infor-
mation desk clerk spent 15 minutes 
researching Nintendo's new 
address and phone number, as well 
as the proper subway route to get 
us there. 

Miho called the number, and I 
told her to tell the Nintendo recep-
tionist that I ran for governor, that 
I had been the opinion editor of a 
San Diego newspaper, that J had an 
American TV show and that I 
needed to interview Miyamoto for 

anyone of those oudets, anything 
to convince them I was worth 
Miyamoto's time. 

It didn't work: All visitors need-
ed an appointment. But that wasn't 
going to stop me. 

We ran toward the subway. It 
was five minutes before 5 p.m.; our 
primary goal - meeting Shi~ 

" An American clerk 
would've laughed at 

me, the hapless fareigner 
who can't speak the 

language ... But I'm not 
in America, I'm in Japan 

-land of excessive 
POl; " uteness ... 

Miyamoto, the creator of "Super 
Mario Bros." - might be rendered 
irrelevant if the workday had 
already ended. But Miyamoto-san 
was rumored to ride his bike to 
work, malcing an encounter all the 

more likely. Hoping that we could 
still catch him on his way out, we 
dashed to the subway and were 
soon joined by more UC students 
from another shrine-touring 
group. Some of us 111.., more excit-
ed than others, we boarded the 
train. 

The arrival station was three 
blocks away from the 12-story 
building. Taro and Miho led us 
toward it. Under my strict orders 
to point out bicyclists in the hope 
that J might recognize Miyamoto 
on his ride horne from work, the 
group started jogging. When we 
turned down an alley and I caught a 
glimpse of the Nintendo logo on 
the top of the building, I took off 
sprinting toward it, always mindful 
of the bicyclists - each of whom 
was potentially my hero. 

I reached the end of the alley 
and stopped in my tracks. 

"Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh 
shit .... " 

It was NmtnuJo. I had waited a 
decade and a half for this moment. 

The others caught up with me 
when I got to the front gate. The 
Japanese students and I approached 
the security guard's window inside 
the "cas de walls." I asked the guard 
if we could see Miyamoto; My Son

Hoping just to get inside the 
building for a peek, I motioned 
toward the front door. He pointed 
at a 3-by-5 index card taped to the 
counter, prepared for just this sort 
of occasion: "I am sorry, you can 
not go in there." 

Funny that there are enough 
English-spealcing Nintendo wor-
shippers that such a sign is neces-
sary. 

A few more pathetically unsuc-
cessful pleadings later ("Taro! Tell 
him I work for a newspaper in San

Miyamoto for an American 'IV

nor!"), we resigned ourselves to 
sitting outside the gate. I took note 
of each passing Nintendo employ-
ee, but recognized none as 
Miyamoto. 

Growing resdess, my comrades 
started to leave. Suddenly, three 
business suit-clad Nintendo 
employees marched out the front 
gate. They weren't just any men

by accepting the GTO are as 
good a place to start as any. 

At UCSD, 1,700 srudents were 
offered the GTO, J 49 of whom 
accepted the offer. In August, they 
were given the option to enroll as 
freshmen instead of transferring 
in with junior standing. and 78 
students accepted the four years 
of enrollment. Granted, 78 is a 
small number of students - virtu-
ally insignificant, really, weighed 
against the thousands who cur-
rendy attend UCSD - but 
regardless, the concept behind the 
admission of those 78 is a good 
one: The UC system is doing 
what it can, with what it has, to 
offer enrollment. 

It's true that it is rather unfair 
that students who turned down the 
GTO offer because they wanted to 
spend four years at a univenity 
miss out on a chance they could 
have had; no doubt there are quali-
fied applicants who would have 
accepted admissions as freshman 
but weren't interested in transfer-
ring as juniors. 

However, the unexpected extra 
funding isn't enough to provide 
four years of enrollment for all 
5,000 applicants offered the GTO, 
so the university is doing the right 
thing by offering those four years 
to the students it can. Better late 
than never, and better some than 
none.

Hotel: Luxury resort and spa 
doesn't benefit students 
continued from page 5 

all, the srudents are the ones who 
support a university whose funds 
and resources are going to a ser-
vice they cannot use. To be fair, 
UCSD students also support 
many other services they cannot 
use, including benefits for UCSD 
staff and philanthropy, but fund-
ing an operation to give five sepa-
rate types of "botanical body 
treatments" to those willing to 
pay does not fall into either of 
these categories. 

The most insulting part of the 
entire affair is that the university 
is miling a considerable effort to 
publicize this bloated resort as a 
positive asset to the UCSD com-
munity. 

To its merit, the Estancia at 
least attempts to follow the initial 
design plan of a "Conference 
Center Hotel Complex" with a 
variety of meeting spaces similar 
to those found in Price Center or 
the chancellor's private compound 
(perhaps the Estancia is better 
suited for university sponsors). 
But in all other aspects, the pub-
licity seems slighdy skewed. 

For instance, the Estancia has 
even agreed, in a gracious gesture 
of immense proportions, to offer 

UCSD staff a special rate of S 17 5 
for the remaining three days of 
September. Check with a boolcing 
agent for details, some restric-
tions may apply. 

On another generous nore, the 
Estancia is willing to employ stu-
dents in a variety of entry-level 
jobs, mostly of the ·courtesy 
clerk" (door opener) or "janitorial 
engineer" (mop man) variety. 

So, University of California, it 
is now up to you. You still own 
the land; get out of this terrible 
situation while you still can. It's 
not a complete loss. 

The existing facility can be 
used as graduate or faculty how;-
ing, a welcome change from the 
19605 relics in La Jolla 
International Gardens. With a 
few modifications, the heated 
pool could become a fantastic 
chemistry/biolo«)' lab complex 
(don't forget to disconnect the 
chlorine!). With the parlcing 
crut)ch in full force, the resort's 
parking facilities would practically 
pay for themselves. 

If we all pitch in, the UCSD 
community can cure the blight in 
our midst that is the Estancia La 
Jolla Resort and Spa. But it', not 
going to be easy.

world - they were- Miyamoto's 
persoll21 underlings, who wanted 
to personally apologize for 
~ Miyamoto being too busy to see 

us. The man himself had seen us 
through the window and sent them 
down. 

Now that I knew that Miyamoto 
had seen me, I was confident that 
he would surely talk to us if we 
waited there JUSt a bit longer. A 
friend and I continued the vigil as 
the rest of the group headed back 
to the subway. 

Eventually, the other Nintendo 
worker bees started talking to us. I 
asked one American-looking 
employee about Miyamoto's 
whereabouts and approximate time 
that he usually left work. "Around 
midnight, probably," was her reply. 
It was 8 p.m. at this point, and 1 
wasn't prepared to camp out until 

midni~t. 
Teliing her about the great sig-

nificance Nintendo holds in my 
life doubtlessly made me sound a 
tad out of touch with reality 
("This is my Mecca - it's a dream 
come true just to be here; I know 
everything about the company 
history &om reading and reread-
ing a 500-page book about 
Nintendo; when 1 was six years 
old I knew I wanted to meet the 
man who created 'Super Mario'"), 
but she flJorl!td at the place. so she 
must have felt at least a little of 
the magic that permeated the 
area. 

Soon after we bid her adieu, a 
portly man with glasses and a pack 
of cigarettes in his shirt pocket 
walked up and tried to talk to us. 
Brave of him, considering he 
knew about as much English as we 
knew Japanese. We said the single 
word that communicated our rea-
son for being there: "Miyamoto-
san!" 

The man told us that Miyamoto 
is "very busy," which we knew, 
then went to fetch an English 
translator who told us, again, that 
Miyamoto was very busy making 
dreams come true and that we 
most likely wouldn't be able to 
meet him. 

"I understand," I said. "But is 
there any way we could get a tour 
of the buildin ?" 

He mumaed something about 
company secrets. Bah., I know all 
their secrets. 

"Oby, yes, I know Nintendo is 
very secretive. Are there any 
brochures or anything we .could 
get?" 

A quick conversation in 
Japanese with his cohort and a 
short wait later, during which we 
enthralled him with tales of how 
much 1 love Nintendo, yielded the 
closest thing to the Holy Grail we 
could hope for under the circum-
stances: the 2004 Nintendo Annual 
Company Repon for stockholders, 
in both EnJlish and Ja~nese. 
Filled with glossy photographs of 
the latest Nintendo products and 
the company's full financial fore-
cast, it was enough to appease me 
into going home, but not before I 
convinced him to hand deliver a 
penonaJ letter to Miyamoto him-
self. 

I arigato'd the heck out of the 
guy, took I photo with him, then 
left for the subway, content with 
the knowledge thlt Shigeru 
Miyamoto has my name, Iddress 
and Japanae cell phone number.

Governor signs new textbook bill 
Second proposal for campus book rentals vetoed 

By CHllmNE KWON 
Senior Staff Writer 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
offered mixed signs on his position 
in the debate over textbook prices, 
signing a bill aimed at reducing 
costs for students and vetoing a 
second proposal to institute book 
rental programs at the state's uni-
versities. 

Schwanenegger gave his stamp 
of approval to legislation written 
by Assemblywoman Carol Liu (0-
La Canada Flintridge), which asks 
for professors to consider price in 
their choice of class readings. 

"While this bill does not man-
date changes, it has shown text-
book publishers that textbook 
costs are a serious concern in this 
state," said Candice Chung, 
spokesperson for Liu. "It has 
brought all of the stakeholders, 
including publishers, to the table 
so that we can find workable solu-
tions to this problem." 

The bill advises faculty to 
consider the "least costly prac-
tices in assigning textbooks" and 
encourages them to work closely 
with publishers to "unbundle" 
books &om extra, costly supple-
ments. Although professors are 
being asked to consider price 
when selecting educational mate-
rial, proponents of the bill 
believe it will not endanger the 
quality of education in 
California's public colleges and 
universities. 

"We're asking our professors 
and faculty to consider the least 
costly options," Chung said. "We 
believe that professors will use 
their best judgment in determin-
ing the least costly option that will 
meet their academic criteria." 

However, Schwarzenegger 
rejected a second bill by 
Assemblyman Paul Koren (0-
West Hollywood) outlining a 
process for the state's public uni-
versities to use in creating text-
book rental services. If approved, 
the bill could have saved students 
more than 50 percent on textbook 
costs, Koretz estimated. 

"I support the author's intention 
to lower textbook costs to college 
students, and am generally support-
ive of textbook rental programs as 
one means to make the overall cost 
of coUege attendance more afford-
able," Schwarzenegger said in his 
veto message. "However, I am 
opposed to provisions in the bill 
that would allow additional fees to 
be assessed to all students, even 
those not using the program, in 
order to keep a textbook rental ser-
vice financially self-sustaining." 

The bills were based on recom-
mendations in a recent report by 
the Cali fornia Public Interest 
Research Group, which found that 
UC students spend almost $900 
annually on books. The report 
also criticized publishers for dri-
ving up prices by packaging books 
with workbooks and other supple-
ments. 

While CALPIRG expressed

disappoinanent with the gover-
nor's veto, the group's Legislative 
Director Steve Blackledge said 
Schwarzenegger's approval for the 
Liu bill will likely save students 
money. 

The new law requires the 
trustees of the California State 
University and the community 
college Board of Governors to 
work with their faculty senates to 

" The textbook is {just} 
the ti~f the ice, 

" g. 

disclose textbook costs and pro-
mote alternative methods of buy-
ing materials. However, the 
statute only requests thar the UC 
regents do the same. 

"Students will see noticeable 
results right away, but to really see 
some substantial savings it's going 
to take some time," Blackledge 
said. "It's up in the air whether this 
will be enough." 

Liu's office has already credited 
the new law with the decision by 

publishers Pearson Education and 
Safari Books Online to launch a new 
digital publishing service that will 
allow students to download books at 
half the costs of printed editions. 

However, the proposal will 
offer little benefit for students of 
UCSD math professor David 
Meyer, who said that he already 
tries to find the most affordable 
readings for his classes. 

"I do consider textbook prices 
when 1 choose them," Meyer said. 

While the Association of 
American Publishers did not take 
an official position on either bill, 
Executive Director for Higher 
Education Bruce Hilderbrand 
criticized the CALPIRG report as 
being inaccurate and said that cur-
rent textbook pricing methods are 
fair. 

"We feel misunderstood, you 
might say," he said. "We believe 
that we are providing incredible 
value for the amount of money 
spent on our textbook." 

By choosing the cheapest 
stand-alone editions, students may 
lose out on valuable supplements, 
Hilderbrand explained. 

"These are the tools that belp 
the professor teach and the student 
learn," he said. "The textbook is

Carignan, the union's vice presi-
dent and a campus administrative 
assistant. 

University staff members have 
not received raises in the past four 
years and students are continually 
seeing their tuition fees climb, she 
said, It the same time that the uni-
versity is agreeing to the addition-
al costs. 

Unlike academic costs and 
salaries, no state money will be 
\lied to pay for the rental proper-
ty, Hayward said. 

'7he funds being used for this 

come from a private donation 
given to [the university) yean. ago 
that has been used by the presi-
dent to address the maintenance of 
chancellors' residences through-
out the system and other costs that 
the state- will not pay for," 
Hayward said. 

As for FOlI's higher salary, mar-
ket forces have driven up wages for 
campus directors across the nation, 
in addition to forcing the uniftnity 
to pay more, aa:ording to Langley. 

"Every time a chancellor gets 
hired, the nte wiD go up," he said. 
"EYeIf c:banceJlor will get more 
than before because the market 
chlnge demands a change [in 

salary)." 
The university will decide by 

early 2005 whether it will follow 
the recommendations and rebuild 
University House. 

"Our initial assessment is that 
the work group has done a thor-
ough job of looking at the long-
term needs of the campus, and we 
can say now that if the necessary 
private funding is ultimately iden-
tified, we'll be looking very 
strongly and seriously at moving 
forward with the project as recom-
mended," Hayward said.

DC may benefit 
frOID stem cell bond 
UCSD scientist helped 
write measure for ballot 

ByU$AMAK 
Associate News Editor 

Scientists and researchers at 
the University of California have 
more at stake than the selection of 
the nation's president in the 
upcoming November elections. 
Voters will also decide the fate of 
Proposition 71, an initiative that 
would obligate the state to issue 
$3 billion in general funding for 
embryonic stem cell research in 
California. 

Cited as the "California Stem 
Cell Research and Cures Act," the 
measure would support stem cell 
research currently taking place in 
labs at UC campuses and may 
bring significant revenue to the 
university, according to an analy-
sis by the state. 

Stem cells are special types of 
cells found in unborn embryos 
and in the human body that have 
the ability to develop into many 
different types of cells. Current 
California law pennits research 
using stem cells obtained from 
human embryos and persons who 
have already been born. 

Research involving the cells 
has allowed scientists to study 
organism development and cell 
replacement, resulting in medical 
advances in certain cancers and 
blood disorders. 

According to the Californians 
for Stem Cell Research and 
Cures, a pro-Proposition 71 
group, future research has the 
potential to lead to cures for other 
diseases, such as diabetes, 
Alzheimer's and AIDS. 

"There's a lot of promise in 
stem cell research," said UC San 
Francisco professor Gail Martin, 
who co-discovered stem cells in 
1981 and first coined the name. 
"There are a lot of problems and 
health-related issues that need to 
be addressed." 

Citing ethical concerns, 
President George W. Bush issued 
an executive order in 2001 limit-
ing federal funding to embryonic 
stem cell lines (a set of cells in 
producti.on) already in existence 
at the time. UCSF is one of only 
two academic institutions with 
stem cell lines approved for feder-
al funding from the National 
Institutes of Health. The univer-

sity distributes cells from its lines 
to scientists worldwide. 

According to a joint analysis 
from the California Legislative 
Analyst'S office and the 
Department of Finance, the 
2003-2004 UC budget included 
$370 million for various types of 
research, with an unknown por-
tion of the funding allocated for 
stem cell research. The report 
also said that the UC system 
would likely receive a share of the 
grants under Proposition 71. 
which could attract additional 
federal or private funding for 
stem cell facilities. 

That funding could also help 
the university secure revenue in 
the form of patents, royalties and 
licensing fees resulting from 
research funded by the measure, 
the analysis said. 

"Public funding dwarfs what's 
available privately, so it's really 

t~~ main driver," said UCSD pro-
fessor of cellular and molecular 
medicine Larry Goldstein, who 
worked with other scientific advo-
cates to write Proposition 71 and 
whose own lab is beginning stem 
cell research. "When [funding) is 
missing because of politics, a lot 
of areas remain underdeveloped." 

Proposition 71 would also cre-
ate the California Institute for 
Regenerative Medicine, a new 
state agency that would award 
grants and loans for stem cell 
research in state facilities.The 
institute would also establish reg-
ulatory standards for research and 
oversee the development offacili-
ties. A separate 29-member 
Independent Citizen's Oversight 
Committee, comprised of repre-
sentatives from certain UC cam-
puses and other research and 
advocacy groups, would govern 
the agency. 

The initiative will also play an 
important role in attracting and 
retaining scientists in the area of 
stem cell research, according to 
Goldstein. 

"It's not just that you want to 
see that there's enough funding," 
Goldstein said. "What you [also) 
want to do is to draw other people 
to join the field, to lower the bar-
riers of entry for the best people."

complex option because it "would 
not negatively impact ongoing 
expansion plans of other campus 
units, [itl ... would provide 
employment opportunities for stu-
dents and had a precedent of being 
acceptable to the surrounding 
community," Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs David R. Miller 
said. 

Estancia Hotel and Spa Public 
Relations Manager Carlyn Shaw 
estimated that approximately 15 to 
20 UCSD sTUdents work at the 
horel . 

In determining the optimal use 
for the land, UCSD Real Estate 
Director Nancy Kossan said the 
university focused on alternatives 
that would best complement - and 
not preclude - campus needs, pro-
vide financial returns and receive 
approval from the surrounding 
comml}nity. 

"A joint Faculty Senate-admin-
istration committee determined 
that the campus had sufficient 
land to meet the expansion needs 
envisioned in the campus' master 
plan, so the land parcel could be 
used for nonacademic purposes to 
benefit the campus in other ways 
and provide a good income," 
Kossan said. 

Kossan estimates that once the 
hotel is fully operational, it will pay 
$600,000 annually in rent to the 
university. The amount will be 
adjusted every five years for infla-
tion. 

Over the course of the lease 
term, the university has the option 
of basing its fees on the value of the 
land or sharing the profits from 
hotel operations, Kossan said. At 
the conclusion of the lease, the land 
will revert to university ownership 
and the regents will decide how the 
land will be used. 

Multiple hotel operators made 
offers for the lease, and administra-
tors chose four for review by a 
committee made up of university 
faculty, staff, students and adminis-
trators. After the committee made 
its recommendations, the UC 
Office of the President awarded a 

, , 

joint contract to Lowe Enterprises 
and Destination Hotels and 
Resorts in January 2000. 

The $60 million complex was 
built with a historical 1800s theme, 
an era in which the property was 
still an equestrian farm. In con-
junction with the San Diego 
Historical Society, builders con-
structed the Estancia in the layout 
of an old California rancho estate, 
modeling three central brick build-
ings after original structures that 
were on site. 

"The lobby is modeled after the 
original barn, and really has an 
adobe struCTUre feel," Shaw said. 
"You can see woven into the build-
ings white brick taken from the 
original structures." 

As the only horel in Southern 
California certified by the 
International Association of 
Conference Centers, the Estancia 
possesses state-of-the-art technolo-
gy and presentation tools, includ-
ing a fiber optic connection to the 
UCSD campus, ergonomic swivel 
chairs, 30-inch-wide non-reflective 
desks and various lighting and cli-
mate controls. Its conference facil-
ities include a 125-seat amphithe-
atre, a 6,OOO-square-foot ballroom 
and other various-sized conference 
areas, totaling 25,000 square feet of 
indoor and outdoor meeting space. 

"We are really designed for 
both business travelers and fami-
lies," said Shaw. "We're not a cook-
ie-cutter hotel. We're designed to 
be a place that gives a sense of 
retreat, so people don't leave feel-
ing they need a vacation from it -
it's Like a little escape." 

UCSD faculty, staff and STU-
dents are currently eligible for 
discounted room rates between 
$179 and $199 per night. Regular 
rates range from 5219 to $J 70. 
Events to commemorate the 
opening of the establishment are 
tentatively scheduled for late 
October or early November and 
will likely include tours of the 
property.

The number of sexual assaults

Opponents of Proposition 71 
have emphasized that they do 
support most stem cell research , 
but do not support the allocation 
of such a large amount of state 
funding for research purposes. 
They also pointed out that 
Proposition 71 mainly funds 
embryonic stem cell research 
while denying funds to cord 
blood and adult stem cell 
research, which have consistently 
produced medical advances. Cord 
blood stem cells are treating over 
90 percent of sickle cell anemia 
patients, according to Johnson. 

"Stem cell research does have 
promise, which is why opponents 
of Prop. 71 support stem cell 
research," Johnson said. "But 
Prop. 71 directs a hugely dispro-
portional amount of state 
resources - all borrowed money 
- into one narrow area."

Regents: 
Stric ter rules 
to begin in 
fall 2007 
continued from page J 

expects the number to fall to 12.8 
percent, still slightly above the 
Master Plan level. 

The changes originally pro-
posed would have raised the mini-
mum GPA to 3.1, but the regents 
scrapped the plan for fear that 
they might "overshoot" their 12.5 
percent goal and turn away too 
many students. 

The board's unwillingness to 
reduce the number all the way to 
the Master Plan level of 12.5 per-
cent angered Regent John J 
Moores, who spolee out in frustra-
tion about the time needed to 
implement the changes and .the 
inability of faculty members to 
estimate the eoet effect of the 
rule changes. 

"We have, unfortunately, a 
long history in this room of voting 
on stuff without complete infor-
mation," Moores said. "I thinle we 
ought to know exactly what we're 
going to vote on." 

Regent Frederick Ruiz, the 
newest member of the board, who 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
appointed in July, opposed the 
stricter grade requirement and its 
expected effect on minorities. 

"I'm really not in favor of rais-
ing [the] GPA," Ruiz said. "I think 
it would be an enormous mi~­
take." 

However, many regents said 
the university could not afford to 
accept more students while the 
state continued to cut its financial 
support. 

"I thinlc that there is an elephant 
in the room that no one is talicing 
about, which is the money that we 
have to run the university," Regent 
Shelly L. Lansing said. "We are in 
this position because we don't have 
the money." 

Students in the audience, 
including members of the UC 
Student Association, spoke out 
against the proposal and at times 
cheered loudly during the debate, 
earning several rebukes from the 
board's secretary. 

The speakers also included 
A.S. President Jennifer Pac, who 
traveled to the San Francisco 
meeting to express concerns about 
the plan. She was accompanied by 
Vice President External Rigo 
Marquez.

off their school spirit. 

Revelle takes the Golden Shoe 
College's win comes week of 40th anniversary 

By HANS FEI LMAN 
Features Editor 

A t UCSD, there are only a handful of time-honored events 
respected and practiced annu-
ally. For 23 years, one of the 
most impomnt of these has 
undoubtedly been the 
Unolympics. 

Revelle College took home 
the competition's coveted 
Golden Shoe on Sep. 22, 

the most in five 

unconventional events, fol-
lowed (in order of points) by 
Earl Warren College, 
Thurgood Marshall College, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
Sixth College and John Muir 
College. 

The proud creation of s<:on 
Bemdes, director of the Spons 
and Recreation Club, the 
Unolympics is held on Rimac 
Field every Welcome Week by 
all six colleges. According to 
Karina VllIud, coordinator of 
student activities at Muir 

College, the Unolympics is the 
first student-run, friendly com-
peti tion between colleges 
where students can come 
together, participate and 
dredge up some school spirit. 

The point system is simple: 
60 points for first place in an 
event, 50 for second, 40 for 
third, and so on. The events 
are judged by one individual 
from each college. A time-
and scorekeeper along with 
three additional judges over-
see the competion and resolve 
scoring disputes. All judges 
are hand-selected by Viaud. 

The first of the five events is 
the entrance. Each college 
begins its entrance perfor-
mance once the students are on 
the field and the college name 
is officially announced. 

Revelle College was declred 
out in blue and gold for their 
"Homecoming" theme. Muir 
College had a "Jammin' 
Jamaican" theme, sporting 
Rasta caps and inflatable mon-
keys. Roosevelt College had a 
"Karate Kid theme," and 
Marshall College went 
"Western" with lassos and 
COWltty music. Warren College 
had a "Pirates" theme with 
swords and eye patches, and 
Sixth College came out as 
"Rhythm Nation," a theme 
inspired by JanetJaclcson's rour. 

Incorporated with each 
entrance is a cheer, the second 
event. Colleges are limited to 
two cheers each and can use 
dancing and props to make the 
cheer more versatile and enter-
taining. 

"The purpose of the cheer 
is to demonstrate the spirit 
and commionent each college 
has for both itself and UCSD 
as a whole," said Viaud. 

Aher the entrance and 
cheer are completed, the actual 
events begin, starting with the 

"Crazy Bat Spin Relay." In each 
event, 10 men and to women 
from each college run to a pre-
detennined location, grab a 
bat, position their fureheads on 
the end of it, spin in six full cir-
cles until they are good and 
dizzy, and then tty to run back 
and slap the next person's hand. 
The first team to finish wins. 

The next event is the "Big 
Balloon Relay." In this event 
each team of 10 men and 10 
women is given six large water 
balloons. The first person up 
speeds around a cone with 
water balloon in hand, runs 
back and then tosses the bal-
loon to the next team member, 
who stands behind a rope sepa-
rating them from the team. 
This rope is gradually moved 
by the judges as the competi-
tion progresses. If the balloon 
breaks during this exercise, the 
balloonless team member must 
stan over. The first team to fin-
ish and sit down in a line wins 
the competition. 

The final "mystery event" 
this year was the "Leap Frog 
Relay." In this event, teams 
fonn a line, and the person at 
the frOnt of the line leaps over 
and ducks Wlder every other 
member of the team with a 
Frisbee in his or her hand . 
Once at the end of the line, the 
"leaper" throws the Frisbee to 
the team member now at the 
front of the line and proceeds 
to perform the obstacle. The 
team with the best time at the 
end of the competition wins. 

Revelle's win came the week 
of the college's 40th anniver-
sary, making the celebration 
that much more memorable. A 
ceremony commemorating the 
40th anniversary of the col-
lege's founding took place Sept. 
24 on Library Walk with Ellen 
Revelle, wife of Roger Revelle, 
serving as honorary chair.

THE MOJITO 
The mojito, the new "it· drink all over the United States. has long 

been regarded as a classic cocktail in its homeland of Cuba. In fact, 
it is rumored that Ernest Hemingway enjoyed many of these minty 
rum drinks during his time in Cuba several decades ago. Mojitos 
were created in Havana, where fresh ingredients common to the 
Caribbean - mint exploding with fiavor. tangy lime and famous 
Cuban rum - were combined for the first time. Together, they cre-
ate an exotic tasting and tropical looking cocktail. 

In the midst of our Indian summer, a mojito is as refreshing as a 
glass of lemonade, but with a bit of a kick. Knock back one or two 
of these minty green cocktails, and you will find yourself dancing to 
a Latin beal. 

This recipe may look daunting at first because of the stovetop 
cooking that is necessary to make Ihe simple syrup, but as its name 
suggests, simple syrup is in fact easy to make. Make a generous 
amount and store it for up to a week so you can whip up a mojito 
at a moment's notice. Simple syrup is a great way to sweeten any fla· 
vored martini, complementing the bitterness that is often found in 
puckers,schnapps and flavored vodkas.

around for about 30 seconds, until you can smell a refresbing aroma. 

Squeeze Ihe juice of both halves of 
the lime into the glass and then drop 
one of the halves into the glass. 

Add the rum and stir. 

Fill the glass to the top with ice. Top 
the cocktail off with a splash of club

Davey's first,half hat trick 
guides Tritons to domination 

Armstrong closes.in o~ milestone 300th 
career VIctOry WIth WIn over Pomona 

By MAlTHEW GIANT 
Sports Editor 

It took junior All-American 
Matt Davey .less than nine min-
utes to do something that took the 
entire Cal Poly Pomona offense 
nearly 90 minutes to accomplish 
in the men's soccer team's 6-1 vic-
tory on Sept. 25 at RIMAe Field: 
to score one goal. If there was any 
misunderstanding about how well 
Davey could infiltrate the 
Broncos' defense, he handily 
scored his second goal of the 
evening at the 39:02 mark in the 
first half. For good measure, he 
sealed a hat trick with a final first-
half goal just 54 Sf!conds later on a 
penalty kick. By halftime, there 
was no mistaking the most dan; 
gerous player on the field, as 
Davey was responsible fo,' every 
goal on the scoreboard. 

RadIeI A r.o.IGuarriitan 
OUt of here: Sophomore defender 
Matt Horme dears the Triton backfield 
on Sept. 25 against Cal Po~ Pomona. 

Davey's first goal came as he 
drilled a shot from more than 25 
yards out that flew into the upper 
left corner of the net at the 8:59 
mark. Sophomore mid fielder 
Chase Douglas assisted Davey for 
his second goal. Davey converted 
the pass and put it into the lower 
right from 15 yards out. 

The Tritons rolled into the sec-
ond h~lf riding on the momentum 
of Davey's hat trick. Junior defend-
er Garrett King scored on a pass 
from Brian Jacobs in the 59th 
minute, followed by unassisted 
goals from senior David Amaya at 
78:25 and junior Grant Nishio at 
85 :46, to give the Tritons a 6-0 
advantage. 

Finally, in the waning moments 
of the match, Cal Poly Pomona 
snuck past senior goalie Edward 
Ruhland to tally the Broncos' only 
score of the match and prevent the 
shutout. 

In the competition, the UCSD 
offense outshot the Broncos 17-4, 
but Cal Poly Pomona retaliated 
physically and earned 26 fouls to 
the Tritons' 19. 

Head coach Derek Armstrong 
tallied his 298th career win, open-
ing ·the door to the possibility of a 
home victory over San Francisco 
State for his 300th career win on 
Oct. 3. 

UCSD maintains its undefeated 
4-0-2 record, with a 3 -0-1 record 
in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. The Tritons 
begin a two-day homestand on 
Oct. 1 with a 7 p.m. match against 
Sonoma State, then an Oct. 3 game 
against San Francisco State at 1 
p.m. Both games will be played at 
RlMAC Field.

Strength as a pack apparent as men's team edges Pomona 

Golf shows promise in 
preseason tourney 

Tritons finish in fifth place after 
gaining lead in first round 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Senior Robert Eap crossed the 
finish line after 25 minutes, 52 
seconds in 14th place, leading the 
UCSD cross country team to a 
fourth-place finish at the 
Stege moiler Cross Country 
Classic hosted by Southern 
lndiana University in Evansville, 
Ind. The women's team finished 
the race in sixth place as sopho-
more All-American TIna Firouz 
topped the Triton effort with a 
16th-place individual perfor-
mance in 23 :32. 

The Triton men's team com-
pleted the event with a collective 
score of 132, lipping ahead of 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Cal Poly 

Pomon~ which finished with a 
team score of 134, despite the fact 
that the top-two finishers in the 
166-competitor field ran for the 
Broncos squad. 

Junior Chris Beetly-Hagler 
fini shed the race practically on 
pace with Eap to record a 17th-
place finish in a time of 25 :59, as 
freshman Mitch Steves trailed by 
less than IS seconds for a 23 rd-

place finish at 26: 10. Junior Carl 
Lostrom was close in pursuit, 
crossing the finish line in 28th 
place at 26: 17. 

Rounding out the Tritons' 
scorers was senior Luke Sigmon, 
who narrowly edged Cal Poly 
Pomona's fifth and final scoring 
racer James Tawney for 50th 
place, 26:42 to 26:43. 

For the women's team, in a 
race that was so close that every 
second lost seemed to account for 
two or three places at the finish 
line, the Tritons suffered a narrow, 
one-point loss to Stonehill 
College. Three Stonehill com-
petitors finished the race ahead of 
Firouz; one of those athletes was 
eight seconds in front, while 
another out-kicked Firouz to a 
fifth-place finish by just two sec-
onds. 

Senior Lindsey Young cruised 
into a 21st-place finish at 24 min-
utes flat, while freshman Amanda 
Burkhart pulled in at 24: II to earn 
24th place. Freshman Diane 
Dunn took 30th place in 24:25 
and sophomore Becky Cherry fin-
ished her race in 24:59 to take 
48th place.

to surmount Stonehill, the Tritons 
left seventh-place Cal Poly 
Pomona no chance, as the Broncos 
finished 46 points behind UCSD. 

Having the opportunity to run 
the course at Southern Indiana 
may prove beneficial later in the 
season for UCSD, since this will 
be the same course that competi-
tors will run for the 2004 NCAA 
Division II Cross Country 
Championships on Nov. 20. In 
2003, the Triton men's team took 
15th place at the event and the 
women turned in a 16th-place fin-

The UCSD golf team started off 
its preseason play on Sept. 17 and 
Sept. 18 by placing fifth in a field of 
29 tearns at the Gold Rush 
California Collegiate Golf Showcase 
hosted by UCLA at the PGA of 
Southern California Golf Qub in 
Beaumont, Calif. 

The Tritons finished their lone 
round on Sept. 17 with a score of 
280, eight under the par of 288, 
which put the team in a tie for first 
with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
Coming back on Sept. 18, UCSD 
posted a 292 in the morning round 
and a 294 in the afternoon. Overall, 
the team turned in a score of 866, 
two over par, which was enough to 
beat crosstown rival San Diego State. 

Tournament host UCLA took 
first place, shooting rounds of 283, 
282 and 276, giving th.e Bruins an 
overall tota 1 of 841. Stanford 
University took a distant second by 
posting scores of 288, 278 and 288,

finishing with an 854. 
UC Riverside came in third, as it 

netted rounds of 292, 286 and 279 to 
give the team 857 overall. St. Mary's 
rounded out the schools that bested 
UCSD, managing to rum in scores 
of 290, 284 and 285 for a grand total 
of 859, seven strokes ahead of the 
Tritons. 

Rounds of 289, 297 and 284 for 
the Aztecs were enough to get 
SDSU six over par to 870 for an 
eighth-place finish. UC Davis fin-
ished ninth with an 874 and UC 
Irvine finished 13 th by shooting 882. 

Individually, UCSD was led by a 
pair of familiar faces, as senior Brian 
Duckworth merited top honors for 
the team with his 12th-place finish 
in a field of over 170 players. 
Duckworth got right down to busi-
ness on Sept. 17, starting off the 
tournament with a score of 67, five 
under par. While he had a touch of 
relative difficulty on the morning of 
Sept. 18, shooting a 75, he was able 
to come back in the afternoon and 
turn in a 71 for a 6naI score ofl I3, 
three under par. 

Fellow senior Joe Dolby took 
second place for UCSD, tying for 
23 rd place overall with his score of 
216. Dolby also had his best round 
on Sept. 17, shooting three under 
par for a 69, returning 00 Sept. 18 to 
shoot an even 72 in the morning and 
a three-over 75 later that day. 

CJinging to Dolby's coattails was 
sophomore Ryo Yamada, whose 217 
was enoogh to earn him a tie for 26th 
and a third-place finish for UCSD. 
Yamada put in an even 72 on Sept. 17 
and earned sc:aes of 74 and 71 in his 
respective rounds on Sept. 18. 

Fourth-place honors for the 
Tritons fell to sophomore Luke 
Leveillee, whose total of 223 put 
him in a tie for 59th place. Leveillee 
started off even par with 72 on Sept. 
17 and rumed in rounds of 74 and 77 
on Sept. 18. 

Rounding out the squad for 
UCSD was senior Robbie Kramer, 
who tied for 122nd place by shoot-
ing 234. Kramer was on a bit of a 
roller coaster, shooting 83 on Sept. 
17, only to come back and finish 
with an even 72 for the early Sept. 18 
round. However, he ran into diffi-
culty again in the afternoon, ending 
with a 79. 

As a team, UCSD had to prove 
that. even 'with the loSs of senior 
Alan Scheer last year, it can still pIJy 
with the best schools in the nation, 
and so far that looks to be holding 
true. The duo of Duckworth and 
Dolby turned in characteristically 
solid rounds, and with a finish like 
this against some of the t~est 
competition California has to offer, 
the Tritons will be in the hunt for a 
championship in the 2004-05 sea-
son.

against the Roadrunners, and each 
team took a victory in last season's 
two matches. 

"We knew we had to come out 
fi red up and ready to go," Wilson 
said. "We [had) to put our all into 
it and our heart into it too ... we 
were reaUy ready for this game." 

Early leads, strong serving and 
a solid defense aided the Tritons in 
their decisive sweep of the 
Roadrunners in front of a huge, 
boisterous crowd at RIMAC 
Arena. 

UCSD dominated Cal State 
Bakersfield in game one, taking a 
quick 30-15 win . The 
Roadrunners hit a paltry .088 to 
the Tritons' .333. The Tritons 
came out firing, holding a big 

lead throughout the game. 
UCSD was flawless in its service 
game with five aces and no 
errors, while the Roadrunners 
had no aces and three errors. In 
addition, senior middle blocker 
Kendra Canape and junior out-
side hitter Lindsay Crandell 
combined for seven kills and 
each hit 1.000 to lead the Tritons 
in the opening game. 

In game two, Wilson peppered 
Cal State Bakersfield with eight 
kills and Ohta registered II assists 
to help the Tritons stave off a 
RoadruMer comeback and give 
UCSD a 30-21 victory. 

UCSD finished the sweep in 
game three, out-hitting Cal State 
Bakersfield .371 to .147 in its 30-
18 win.

"I think the biggest factor is 
that we played more relaxed," 
McFarland said. "We played a lit-
tle bit tight the last couple of 
matches [against) Cal State Los 
Angeles and Cal State San 
Bernardino. The team kind of 
relaxed and just played with more 
confidence, and thatl; really closer 
to the level that I thinle they're 
capable of." 

McFarland was pleased to see 
the Tritons improve from the last 
match and adjust to take the early 
lead in the games. 

"Two things were key - one is 
that almost every player we have 
was serving tough and put a lot of 
service pressure, and that was a big 
difference," McFarland said. "And 
our passing was really good 
[tonight). Teresa [Ohta) is a fabu-
lous setter, she has a lot of capaci-
ty and can really get our offense 
going." 

Ohta had 29 assists and II digs 
for the night while Wilson led the 
Tritons with 12 kills. Canape con-
tribmed nine kills, while Crandel 
hit .636 and added eight kills. 
Dunsmore and freshman libero 
Natalie Facchini had 10 and 12 
digs, respectively, for UCSD. 
McFarland and his players also 
felt the strong fan support was a 
big advantage in helping the team 
win. 

"r felt that we played great as 
a team," WIlson said. "And the 
energy from the crowd was 
amazing. It is so great to have all 
these fans here, and we all hope 
they return - that'd be awe-
some."

pleased with the progress of his 
young players. 

"They've been doing everything 
really well ," McManus said. 
"They're doing what I'm wanting 
them to [do); they've got to step up 
a little bit more, they've gotta grow 
up quickly. They're taking the 
place of nine starting seniors with 
four years of experience, so it's real-
ly difficult." 

The Tritons answered their 
coach's call and stepped up their 
play in an away match at Cal Poly 
Pomona, where they handily 
defeated the Broncos, 3-1. 

Dickey headed in a goal off of a 
corner kick by junior midfielder 
Kristina De La Rosa to give UCSD 
an early lead in the 35th minute. 
However, Cal Poly Pomona's 
Jacqueline Ragudos answered with 
an unassisted shot that found the 
back of the net, tying up the match 
in the 51st minute. Ragudos ' goal 
proved to be the only highlight for 

the Broncos as UCSD took the 
match, scoring two unanswered 
goals. 

In the 53rd minute, Dickey 
assisted on a goa I to record her 
second point of the match . She 
fed a corner kick to fellow sopho-
more midfielder Heather Sugg 
who, amid the crowd in front of 
the Broncos' net, jumped and 
headed the ball to score the go-
ahead goal Almost 20 minutes 
later, sophomore midfielder Alise 
Malley knocked an unassisted 
insurance goal into the right cor-
ner, completing the Tritons' vic-
tory. 

Lautenschleger registered four 
saves for the Tritons in five 
attempts, and Ragudos' goal was 
only the third goal that the UCSD 
goalie has allowed in eight games 
so far. 

UCSD is back in action at 
RIMAC Field on Oct. I against 
Sonoma State. The match begins at 
4:30 p.m. 

The Tritons embark on a brief 
road trip to take on Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Oct. 1 and 
Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 2 before 
returning home to host Sonoma 
State on Oct. 7 at 7 p.m.

The second-ranked UCSD 
women's volleyball team proved . 
that it belongs atop the rankings 
with two key league wins against 
Cal State Los Angeles (30-21, 24-

30, 30-26, 30-27) on Sept. 22 and 
Cal State Bakersfield (30-15, 30-
21 , 30-IS) on Sept. 24. UCSD 
improved to IS - I , and a perfect 
5-0 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play.

lied 17 and 12 kills, respectively, 
while senior setter Teresa Ohta 
had 51 assists to lead the Tritons 
against visiting Cal State Los 
Angeles (9-5) in four games. The 
Tritons had beaten the Golden 
Eagles in three games last season, 
but this time, Cal State Los 
Angeles gave UCSD a bit of a 
scare, taking the second game and 
forcing the Tritons to overcome 
the Golden Eagles' early lead. 

"I think the last time we played 
[Cal State Los Angeles] down 
here, we beat them very decisively 
in three [games)," UCSD head 
coach Duncan McFarland said. 
"And we thought that might be 
happening again." 

In the first game, the Tritons 
and Golden Eagles were knotted 
up at 13 points apiece, but five 
straight UCSD points gave the 
Tritons the lead they needed to 
claim a 30-21 victory. However, 
the Golden Eagles bounced back 
in game two, taking an early 17-7 
lead. McFarland called a time out 
to rally his team. 

"I tried to keep them focused 
because [ think we were distract-
ed," McFarland said. "We weren't 
playing normally, and we were 
capable of playing much better. 
We were kind of wondering what 
was going on out there." 

The Tritons battled back to tie 
it up at 23 pOints each, but the 
Golden Eagles pushed on and took 
game two, 30-24, ev.ening up the 
score to one game apiece. 

In the next game, UCSD and 
Cal State Los Angeles played 
evenly, trading leads until a block 
by senior middle blocker Katie 
Hogan gave the Tritons a 26-24 
leaa and an ace by senior libero 
Robin Parlette provided UCSD 
the cushion it needed to close out 
game three, 30-26. 

In game four, UCSD again 
found itself down early in the 
game, trailing the Golden Eagles 
6-11 . But the Tritons found their 
groove and came back to tie it up 
at IS points apiece. Ensuing kills 
by Ohta and Hogan, along with a 
Dunsmore ace, put UCSD ahead 
21-1S, and the Tritons clung to the 
lead to clinch game four (30-27) 
and the match. 

"We were struggling with start-
ing off strong today, so that's 
something we definitely have to 
work on in practice," Hogan said. 
"We're usually a team that likes to 
come out strong 'and push all the 
way through, so that was a little 
unsettling at first. We don't like to 
have to [play catch-up] but in cases 
like that, we'll do what we have to 
do - but we definitely want to 
start off stronger. " 

Hogan was also clutch for 
UCSD, making key plays in the 
match. She hit a match-high .500 
with 14 kills and added a match-
high eight blocks. 

"I had a really fun match," 
Hogan said. "Sometimes when 
we're down and we have that pres-
sure, our coach really talks about 
using the pressure to your advan-
tage. And from the times when I 
come in and I knew we were down, 
I would try to use that as an incen-
tive to work harder and [do) the 
best of what I could to not make 
errors. I was thinking more of just 
doing my best to contribute to my 
team and [make up] for the deficit 
that we have." 

Learning its lesson from its 
previous match, UCSD was deter-
mined to come out with more 
agression against rival Cal State 
Bakersfield on Sept. 24. The 
Tritons were 12-12 all-time

Women's soccer excels with youthful s.quad 
Bench comes through in the clutch for UCSD in narrow win over Toros 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

With the departure of nine 
seniors from the UCSD women's 
soccer team, the pressure was on 
the younger players to fill the void. 
If the beginning of the season is 
any indication of what's to come, 
then head coach Brian McManus 
can be confident that the youth 
will step up to the task. 

On Sept. 22 at RIMAC Field, 
freshman forward Chelsea 
Campbell came off the bench to 
lift the Tritons late in the second 
half, giving UCSD a 1-0 victory 
over feisty Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. On the road, sophomore 
midfielder Megan Dickey headed 
in a goal and assisted on another to 
lead the visiting Tritons to a 3-1 
victory against Cal Poly Pomona 
and help her teammates hand 
McManus his 29Sth career win. 

In the home match against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, the 
Tritons struggled in the opening 
half, playing a step behind the 
Toros, who outshot them S-4. 
Despite that, the Tritons mustered 
up a few scoring chances, the clos-
est one being when Dickey nar-
rowly missed an open shot on the 
right side in the 26th minute of the 
first half. The Tritons did edge the 
Toros in corner kicks, 4-2, but 
came up empty. 

UCSD senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger came up with four 

saves in the first half. In her first, 
she jumped up to deflect Toro 
Lauren Lowery's shot just above 
the net to keep Cal State 
Dominguez Hills scoreless. 

McManus knows his players 
need to play with more energy and 
stamina. 

"We're not fit yet," he said. 
"The conditions here - the sun 
and the heat - we're not quite 
ready for those yet. We've got a lot 
of young kids coming straight 
from club, so the fitness isn't there 
yet. We'll be working on that." 

In the second half, the Tritons 
resumed play with more energy 
and spent most of their time in the 
Toros' defensive zone. The 
Tritons had a couple of good scor-
ing opportunities, with freshman 
midfielder Ali Lai showcasing her 
footwork, beating two Toro 
defenders to take a shot that nar-
rowly sailed over the right post. 
Campbell was also a threat, getting 
a shot off her left foot with two 
Toros draped over her, but the 
Toro goalie came up with a big 
save. Campbell later answered by 

. scoring a goal in the middle of a 
serum at the Toro net, with junior 
mid fielder Meira Dinsmore pick-
ing up the assist. 

"It was a corner kick and we do 
reaJly well on set plays," Campbell 
said. "And [the ball] was near post 
and we usually have someone in 
front of the keeper just for that, 
and one of my teammates just got 

a head on it and it just dropped 
right in front of me." 

The lone Triton goal was 
Campbell's third goal of the sea-
son. Despite the pressure to live up 
to last year's team, Campbell has 
enjoyed playing for UCSD. 

"It's intense and there's a lot of 
pressure because [the players] were 
so good last year, and we have to 
try and live up to the wonderful 
seniors," she said. "We're getting 
there, but it will still tOe awhile." 

In the last few minutes of the 
match, the Toros desperately tried 
to even the score, battling for scor-
ing chances in the Tritons' defen-
sive zone. But UCSD protected its 

lead with the aid of junior Heather 
Szafraniec and freshman Nicole 
Pepper to secure the victory. 

"[The Toros) were throwing 
the ball up in the air, hoping for a 
Hail Mary, that's what you expect, 
you've just got to work hard and 
get through it," McManus said. 
"And the [team) did well." 

This victory improved UCSD~ 
record to 5 -1 overall and 1-1 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, while dropping Cal 
State Dominguez Hills to 5-3 and 
1-1 in the CCM.

UCSD Intercollegiate 

Athletics held the fourth annual 
Triton Power Hour at RIMAC 
Arena to promote athletics and 
student organizations for incom-
ing freshmen on Sept. 20. UCSD 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox wel-
comed the freshmen to the cam-
pus, encouraging them to make 
the most of their time at UCSD. 
She also emphasized her desire to 
communicate openly with the stu-
dents by attending student organi-
zation meetings. 

After Fox's speech, UCSD 
Athletic Director Earl W. 
Edwards presented her with a 
baseball jersey with the number 
one on it. 

"We'd like to officially wel-
come you to our Triton family," 
Edwards said to Fox. "You're 
number one in our hearts." 

A.S. President Jenn Pae 
informed the freshmen about var-
ious activities they can participate 
in, like joining any of the 400 stu-
dent organizations on campus. 
She also encouraged students to 
register to vote and participate in 
Rock the Vote for the upcoming 
presidential election. 

The UCSD dance team and 
the UCSD cheerleaders per-
formed while the men's water polo 
team threw prizes out to the 
crowd. More prizes, including a 
surfboard and concert tickets, 
were also raffled off. 

To conclude Triton Power 
Hour, junior Grant Nishio of the 
men's soccer team and senior 
Kendra Canape of the women's 
volleyball team talked about 
UCSD athletics and showed a 
brief video of highlights from the 
2003-04 athletic season. Nishio 
and Canape stressed the impor-
tance of student support at sport-
ing events and asked the freshmen 
to attend the upcoming home 
matches for the fall sports teams. 

"The best part about playing is 
when you guys come support us," 
Nishio said to the freshmen. 
"Come out because we have' big 
games this week against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills." 

At the conclusion of Triton 
Power Hour, the Intercollegiate 
Athletics Department and a group 
of Triton athletes gave out free 
food to the students in attendance. 
The department also had an infor-
mation booth set up outside 
RIMAC Arena while other student 
organizations worked their own 
booths to recruit new members. 

John Muir College freshman 
Megan Wogan of Danville, Calif., 
found Triton Power Hour to be 
informative. 

"I heard about Triton Power 
Hour from our Muirsaic 
Calendar," Wogan said. "It was 
fun seeing who got the raffle 
prizes, and I might go and watch 
[the upcoming home games]." 

The event also sparked the 
interest of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College freshman Adam Jimenez 
of Santa Barbara, Calif. 

Mrrriton Power Hour activities] 
were fun and informative," he 
said. "I want to join clubs, and 1 
want to go watch basketball and 
soccer."
