Med Center 
UCSD 
heals in 
Hillcrest 

By JACKIE KERMANI 

While UCSD has a medical 
school which is located here on 
campus, the UCSD Medical 
Center is a full scale hospital 
located in Hillcrest. The Med 
Center ensures good medicine 
administered to patients with a 
human touch. The center's var-
ious innovative programs also 
boast the latest in technical 
advancements making it a cru-
cial part of not only UCSD but 
also the San Diego community. 

One of the more vital and high 
pressure areas of the hospital is 
the 24-hour trauma center which 
is always prepared to deal with 
life-threatening situations . A 
trauma center treats patients who 
are seriously injured. 

Peggy Fridlund, part of the 
trauma center team, explained 
the differences between patients 
who are sent there and those who 
are sent to emergency rooms. 
"Patients who have a gunshot 
wound to the chest, or were on a 
motorcycle and got ejected and 
slid SO feet or [who received] a 
stab wound to the heart are con-
sidered trauma patients. "In con-
trast, Fridlund said that emer-
gency room patients are "people 
who fell out of a tree and broke 
their foot . . . [or] it is someone 
who could potentially die from 
the injury they have." 

The trauma center's always-
ready staff consists of 12 people. 
As the patient arrives in the 
ambulance one person notes the 
estimated time of arrival (ETA) 
while a doctor accompanies the 
patient from the ambulance to 
the trauma center. Once in the 
trauma center, the patient is met 
by six doctors , 2 nurses, an x-ray 
technician and a radiologist. 

"It is a big preparation . . . we 
videotape all of our resuscita-
tions [recoveries] and then I 
review them to see how they 
went ," Fridlund said. On the wall 
directly opposite the video 
camera is a large round clock 
monitoring the time which allows 
the medical team to review the 
operations and get feel for how 
time efficent the recovery was . 
This review process helps them 
lea rn how to use new or different 
techniques in future emergency 
ituations. 

Trauma centers are located in 
key locations throughout various 
area in the community; when a 
call is ent into the hospital , an

University: Research Initiative 

Undergraduate 
seminars to 

• • start In spring 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
N~ws Editor 

A broad range of undergradu-
ate eminars available to both 
lower- and upper-di visi on stu-
dents will be offered for the first 
time at UCSD next quarter, ful -
filling a recommendation of the 
Academic Council of the Uni-
versity of California . 

The council' Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP) made 
the recommendation earlier this 
academic year, partly in response 
to a report published a year-and-
a-half ago by a UC task force . 

The Smelser report on under-
graduate education, named for 
UC Berkeley professor Neil 
Smelser, called for a variety of 
change in undergraduate edu-
cation as offered by the UC sys 
tem. A limited amount of facul-
ty I student contact and a general 
lack of understanding by stu-
dents of the research their pro-
fessors are going was discovered 
by the group that put together 
the report. The CEP's recom-

mendation was described a s a 
"spinoff' of the Smelser report 
by Warren Provost David Wong 
in a recent interview. "The idea is 
that undergraduate students 
often have very little chance of 
seeing or contact ing facult y when 
in a usual class .. . and , secondly, 
students hear about this great 
research institution , but really 
know very little of research 
activities ... 

One undergraduate eminar 
was offered la t fall , and two are 
being taught this winter, but the 
biggest select ion yet will be made 
available this spring, when 17 
seminars instructed by professors 
from 14 departments will be listed 
in the class schedule . 

" We have contemplated var-
ious approaches [to structuring 
these seminars] ," Wong said . 
"The consensus was that it should 
have some credit 0 students feel 
they're getting something out of 
it." The seminars will be worth 
one unit each, and students will 
typically be required to turn in

U CSD funding share is reduced 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
St~f W,itn 

A cap on Defense Department 
research funding through its 
University Research Initiative 
(URI) program promises to cut 
UCSD's share ofthat program's 
budget by 40 percent. The results 
will include a discontinuance of 
summer salaries for 15 faculty 
members as well as the cancella-
tion of three research programs, 
visitor'S programs and funding 
for seminars and summer 
schools, unless alternate funding 
is found . 

Legislation was passed in 
December by a joint committee 
of the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives and Senate to enact a 14 
percent limit on URI funds 
available to anyone state. The 14 
percent cap is based loosely on 
the state with the greatest number 
of scientific and engineering doc-
toral graduates - California, 
which has 13.2 percent. 

The total Defense Department 
fund available to the UC ystem 
underthe URI has been cut from 
$19.2 million in fi cal 1987 to 

$11.9 million for fiscal 1988, 
according to Edward Furtek, 
assistant director of federal rela-
tions for the Washington office 
of the UC system. 

The URI funds interdiscipli-
nary, interdepartmental univer-
sity research projects that have 
both defense and commercial 
applications and are identified as 
critical to national interests. 
Now, "researchers will have to 
apply to other agencies other 
than the URI for additional 
funding ," said Pentagon spokes-
person Jan Bodanyi. 

The Defense Advanced Re-
search Project Agency 
(DARPA), one of four URI 
funding agencies in the Depart-
ment of Defense, is "in the pro-
cess of going through all of their 
contracts and making cuts in an 
ongoing effort to bring Califor-
nia and Massachusetts under 
their 14 percent limit for fiscal 
1988," Bodanyi said . 

The legislation has major 
implication for UCSD and the 
Scripps In titute of Oceanog-
raphy because they rece ived 
almo t 25 percent of URI fund s 

available to California prior to 
the legislation. 

So far, II UC research pro-
grams funded by the URI are 
directly affected by the Depart-
ment of Defense cuts, three of 
which are at UCSD: research on 
remote sensing of the ocean at 
Scripps; the study of high-speed 
and high-density hard disk tech-
nology at the AMES department; 
and a study of a prototypical 
wing with an application to 
commercial aircraft at the Insti-
tute for Non-linear Science. 

The UCSD scientists involved 
in these programs feel that these 
cuts are a disaster because they 
cannot continue research on 
these projects . "These [project] 
proposals were submitted to the 
Defense Department in 1986, 
competed for review, and were 
funded under URI ," said Henry 
D.l. Abarbanel , the principal 
inve tigator for one of the UCSD 
group that received a URI 
grant. "Now the projects are 
topped dead in their tracks and 

the process of receiving funds 
from another agency take about 
a year." 

Marc Fleischman 
Dr. Henry 0 .1. Abarbanel 

Geoff Vallis, a research mete-
orologist at Scripp , said that 
"we are going to have to lay peo-
ple off, cancel our research in 
ocean modeling , cancel our

Skateboard ra,mp reopens Seminars Continued from pale I 
one five-page paper to earn that 
unit. Grading will be pass / no-
pass only. 

Lisa Forman is one of two women skaters in the skate club and 
she says that women "should come and try it [the club) o~t. " 

By ISABELLE TIHANYI 
SI4/! W,ile, 

The grand opening of the 
remodeled skate ramp last Sat-
urday afternoon marked the 
end of an eight-month struggle 
to save it from destruction by 
University red tape, 

Located behind the Physical 
Plant Services storage area near 
Mesa Apartments, the ramp 
was built by the UCSD skate 
club, "Ready to Shred!"(RTS), 
last April and closed by Cam-
pus Recreation two weeks after 
it opened because the club had 
not followed University proce-
dure and construction policies. 

With improved security and 
a national insurance policy 
through the Boy Scouts of 
America, the ramp has been 
approved and is a complete 
success, according to Laurel 
Dean, the recreations club co-
ordinator and RTS adviser. "It 
turned out great. The club did 
everything themselves and they 
have totally abided by all Uni-
versity rules ... 

R TS enclosed the ramp area 
with an eight-foot high fence 
topped with barbed wire. "Se-
curity is 100 percent better than 
last year," said Jim Clifford , 
RTS member. "No one can cut 
the kryptonite locks which at-
tach the steel poles blocking the 
ramp," 

With a skateboard ban in 
effect through congested and 

popular parts of campus, RTS 
members are happy to have 
their sport legitimized. "This 
project shows the power that 
college students can create when 
they put their minds together 
and work for something really 
important," said Muir student 
Tobin Giblin. 

"The ramp is open only to 
UCSD students, faculty and 
staff who are club members," 
Dean said . As official Explorer 
Post No. 2712 every club 
member is also a Boy Scout. 
"Without the help of the Boy 
Scouts the ramp would be 
gone," Dean added . 

Rules are posted on the ramp 
and all club members actively 
enforce them . Every skater 
wears the mandatory safety gear 
including a helmet, knee pads 
and elbow pads. 

New members are encour-
aged to join, said lisa Forman, 
one of two women skaters in 
the club. "All the guys have 
been really friendly and sup-
portive. I'm sure that there are 
girls out there who are inter-
ested. They should come and 
try it out," Forman said. 

A donat io n was given by the 
Taylor-Duikema Co. to replace 
the masonite covering on the 
ramp. The covering was cut out 
to keep anyone from using the 
ramp while it was closed. Cam-
pus Recreation helped with the 
fencing costs. ~ 

Two methods of fitting the 
seminars faculty members' (who 
are not required to teach the 
seminars) schedules were consi-
dered . Having faculty drop one 
four unit class in favor of teach-
ing four one unit seminars was 
rejected because the departments 
could not afford losing that many 
instructors . "The final scheme 
we came up with [required en-
couraging] faculty to take one 
unit seminars as overload, but 
we give them some instructional 
and research support ... some 
money, [the spending of which 
must be] rather loosely tied with 
the seminar," Wong said. 

Those faculty who teach the 
seminars, then, are taking on one 
unit more than their required 
instructional workload (which 
v~ries from department to de-
partment), but receive $1 ,000 to 
be used in their research. 

Philosophy Professor Stephen 
Stich is teaching a seminar on 
The Irrational, described in a 
brochure as "an examination of 
recent psychological studies of 
human irrationality and their 
implications (or epistemology, 
education and social policy." 

"David Wong convinced me 
to do the seminar," Stich said in 
an interview. "The underlying 
motive [is that] I think it's 
important that what the semin-
ars are tryi ng to accomplish is 
accomplished ... undergraduates

The Hangman Cometh 
.. When you strike at a king. you must killlrim . .. - Ralph Waldo 

Emerson. 

T he sun comes up late in Phoenix . It was st ill dark at 7 in the morning when they th rew me out of the Jacuzzi for being naked. I 
had complai ned that the water wasn't hot enough , so a man in a 
brown suit with a heavy RED voltmeter in his hand came rushing 
through the huge iron gate leading into the pool area and started 
yelling about all the things that were wrong. 

"How far can they push meT' he houted . "Who's making all these 
complaints? You're naked! The water's too cold , the guests went 
crazy, orne rotten animal screw-head turned my light out and 
screwed around with my temperature valves . .. I quit!" he screamed. 

"Calm down," I said. "You're ick! You're a wretched, lying 
whore! You're out of your mind! Get away from me! I have my own 
problems." 

I slid up from the water and down the cold slab stairs to my 
cactus-covered suite on the far edge of the parking lot, where the 
sheriff wa waiting with two other men who said they were private 
detective . 

"These gentlemen want to a k you some que t ions," said the 
sheriff. "They represent the Evan Mecham Legal Defense Fund." 

" Wonderful ," I said. "Let's go outside." They shuffled out. saying 
nothing, while I reached into my golf bag and jerked out a 12-ga uge 
Smith & Wesson riot gun, cranked one round of 00 high brass 
buck hot into the chamber and 'followed them outside . There was a 
lot of quick screaming when they saw the weapon . Everybod y ran. I 
put eight rounds into the front of their rented Bu ick, and after that it 
was quiet. 

N obody seemed to notice. These things happen in Phoenix. It i the only town in the world where people threaten to kill me every 
time I come to town . This time it was beaten to death , which is almost 
mild, in context, or compared to what happened to Don Bolles. Life 
is cheaper here than it was during the last days at Phnom Penh. 

My bodyguard picked me up and we drove downtown to the state 
Capitol building, where an ugly-tempered crowd had gathered in the 
main hearing room of the House of Representative building to 
watch the impeachment hearings. They had already hung Mecham 
sometime around 8 that morning, but the body was still twitching 
when we got there around noon. Some of the goverl'or's people had 
posted themselves outside the main door, handing out leaflets a nd 
crude cartoo ns about cowards, com munist and sodomites. 

The governor had been arraigned earlier that day on six felon y 
charges. He pleaded "not guilty." After being photographed , finger-
printed and treated like a common criminal, he was quickly led out of 
the courthouse and whisked away in his limousine. 

He will need all the help he ca n get, this time. H e is fighti ng on 
three fronts at once. And odds right now are about 8-1 against him, 
the same bleak nu mbers that Larry Holmes carried into the ring 
against Mike Tyson last week , and that one might as well have been 
88-1 . When a sportswriter asked Tyso n if he thought there was any 
cha nce that he might lose, he rep lied , "Only if there's a sniper in the 
crowd ." 

That pretty well sums up Mecham's si tuation . He is facing a 
se ri ous recall election, six felony charges and a full-bore impeach-
ment trial between now and June, and the mood in Arizo na is 
vengeful. There is no such thing as paranoia in Evan Mecham's life 
these days. His worst fears and most insane suspicions are all t rue. 
They really are out to get him. 

When I went d own to the state Capitol building on Washington 
Street last week , the atmo phere was edgy a nd mea n, but there was 
nothing uncertain about it. I ha ve covered enough of these th ings 
from Nixon and the fiendish Wilbur Mills to Oliver North and Judge 
Bork to have a pretty good sense of the crowd and the governing 
mood, as it were, no matter who's on trial. . .. 

And there was no mistaking the mood of hardball finality in the 
Ca pitol. The witnesses called to testify under oath against the gover-
nor on felony obstruction-of-justice charges spoke wi th the confident 
clarity of men who had no fear. They had been cowed long enough by 
the threat of Mecham's cheapjack vengeance, but now he was on the 
run ... When he accused his enemies of bugging his office with 
laser-beam listening devices, the response among political staffers 
was to talk through the halls wearing tinfoil sku ll-caps and joki ng 
about "warding off laser beams." 

It was like the time Jimmy Carter was attacked in his rowboat b y a 
huge rabbit that came out of the water and weot for his throat like a 
shark . That incident marked the end of Carter 's effectiveness in the 
White House, and the laser joke was a death blow for Mecha m. 

T he only problem now is how to make him disa ppear without heaping more scum and ridicu le on Arizona 's image . 
But Mecham will not go away. He is li ke o ne of those big pack ra.ts 

who will move into yo ur house a nd decide to stay forever: he WIll 
build a palatial nest somew here deep in the walls a nd spend the rest of 
hi life steali ng Bhat chains and gold Rolexes and anythtng else that 
glitters. . . . 

They have expensive taste, and the only way to get nd of a pack rat 
is to lure it out in the open - which is almost impossi ble and"blow 
its head off with a .22 Magnum or a .410 rat gun . 

But you don't want to miss or slightly wound the bea~t or ev~n 
poison him because then he will slink back into the wllls and dIe, 
leaving you with a pile of death and di sease and ~tink ing black meat 
that will eventually poison the whole house.

"Swim Fags" 
Respond 
Editor: 

After reading the letter to the 
editor from Richard Wood 
Massi published in the Guard· 
ian on Feb. I. we would like to 
clarify some of its inaccuracies. 

In our view, the intramural 
program provides an excellent 
outlet from the rigorous aca-
demic environment present at 
UCSD. Competition, recrea-
tion and fun are the reasons 
that we compete in the intram-
ural program. We feel that the 
intramural department does an 
outstanding job. However, 
outside of foul language, the 
intramurals bylaws contain no 
concessions regarding team 
names and decorum. Although 
we should not have to justify 
ourselves, it is clear that Mr. 
Massi has been disturbed by 
our name and we feel a need to 
clarify a few points. We will 
start by explaining a few things 
about our name. 

The Scales of Justice Every membe'r of the "Swim Fags" is also a current member 
of the UCSD intercollegiate 
swim team . We refer to the 
word "fag" as meaning tedious 
work or drudgery. The name 
"Swim Fags" was adopted by 
our distance swimmers who put 
in longer hours in the pool each 
week and swim more yards than 
the rest of the team. We have 
adopted this name as our 
intramural team name with no 
intention of mocking gay peo-
ple. 

All of Torrey Pines 
Should be a Park 
By MATT MAC ARTHUR 
Staff Writer 

Once there was a piece of 
ocean floor indistinguishable 
from any other piece of ocean 
floor . Over time, layer upon 
layer of sand and silt piled up 
on this piece. Because of the 
collision of two gigantic seismic 
plates , this piece began to rise. 
Soon , it rose above sea level, 
formi ng an island. 

This is land merged with a 
mainland and beca me a high 
bluff overlooking the sea. The 
soil and climate were perfect 
for a wide variety of plants 
which grew only in a few other 
places in the world . One of 
these plant was the torrey pine. 
Animals liked thi s bluff too, 
includ ing the animal called 
man. Together, this commun-
ity of plants and animals peace-
fully coexisted . 

Such a choice piece of prop-
erty didn't remain peaceful for 
some men found it and named 
the area "the jewel," because it 

was so beautiful. More impor-
tantly, they claimed it for their 
own. More men came from 
every direction, each calling it 
theirs, and fought over owner-
ship. A victor emerged, and 
news spread of this jewel they 
had won . So many people 
wanted to enjoy it and call it 
theirs, but there wasn't room 
enough for everybody. 

There especially wasn't room 
for the silent members of the 
land's original community, so 
they were either run out or 
moved. Instead, foreign plants 
and animals were brought in, 
along with roads, houses, cars, 
putting greens, a university, and 
lots of people. This land was 
nO'w "civilized." 

What can we learn from this 
story? We can pity the deported 
re mnants of the Indian tribes 
who once wintered on this land . 
We can mourn for the endan-
gered torrey pines that were cut 
down only to have a golf course 
and a four-lane road named 

See PINES, page 6 

Mr. Massi alludes to the fact 
that our name implies "gay 
people can't play sports." As we 
have tried to explain, our name 
in no way refers to gay people. 
Also, it is clear that we , as a 
team, can "play sports." Tes-
tament to this is our 3-1 record 
and our current ranking as the 
No.8 team in Men's A basket-
ball . In addition , as we have 
stated, we are all members of 
the UCSD intercollegiate swim 
team. 

Last, we would like to explain 
what Mr. Massi calls our "pur-
posefully ridiculous" clothing 
- it is what we wear in all of 
our games, Speedo swimming 
suits. These outfits are merely 
another way of identifying our-
selves as swimmers. 

We use a word "fags" that

after them. We can argue that 
the La Jolla Farms develop-
ment should never have been 
allowed to scar the beautiful 
cliffs. But what will we learn 
from these things? 

The most poignant lesson to 
be learned is from the many 
people who thought that they 
could chip off a part of the 
jewel for themselves, even in a 
place where everyone could see 
the blemish, and at the same 
time retain the beauty of the 
whole. 

We should take advantage of 
the fact that a large portion of 
this beautiful land had been 
entrusted to a public institution 
of which we are mentors. And 
while it is far too late to pre-
serve the land as it originally 
was, and perhaps at this point it 
would be wrong to do so, we 
can and should shape the en-
vironment in a way that does 
this land justice. The real plea-
sure is from sharing the beauty, 
and making sure that everyone 
can have that same experience. 

UCSD can do that. Granted, 
this land has been confiscated 
and altered like any other piece 
of property. But the difference 
is that each one of us here had 
an equally free opportunity to 
come share this environment 
for a time before passing it on 
to others, in return for hard 
work and some contribution to 
its maintenance. That fact alone 
is a real tribute to this piece of 
land. In return forthe use of the 
land, we must respect it and use 
it carefully and tastefully, as 
well as ensuring its availability 
for future tenants. 

In order to do this , three 
things must be taken into ac-
count: 

• Aestheti'cs - This is a 
tricky area becasue everyone 
has a different idea of what is 
beautiful. Above all , anything 
we construct should not con-
flict with the landscape. I n-
stead, it should honor the land-
scape. Many people think that

ical manner. It is unfortunate 
that Mr. Massi is so insecure 
that he is offended by the use of 
this word when he does not 
even understand the context in 
which it is being used ; he only 
assumes that it refers to homo-
sexuals. We're curious if Mr. 
Massi' would reevaluate his 
response as also being stereo-
typical. 

Mr. Massi has implied that 
all 15 pictured participants are 
right-wing religious bigots. We 
resent this stereotyping and 
would like to once again state 
that our name has nothing to 
do with sexual preference, reli-
gion, and / or political beliefs. 
As Mr . Massi has stated him-
self, "Humor is great. Sports 
are fun . There's no reason [for 
anyone] to insult people and 
shut them out of participation." 
We regard this stereotyping as 
an insult to everyone on the 
team and feel that Mr. Massi 
should take his own advice and 
not attempt to shut us out of 
participation.

T.P. should 
Be a Park 
Continued rrom pale S 
Central Library is a perfect 
example of this , because it 
somehow captures the spirit of 
the land .. . . it is ajewel in itself, 
of sort . ( It is easy to sound 
ridiculous when talking aesthe-
tics .) 

• Function - We are , of 
course, a university. While nat-
ural parks are very good things, 
parks don't always attract stu-
dents or faculty, hold books, 
create scientifically controlled 
environments, or house con-
certs. A university needs to do 
these things, and a lot more. 
Thus, it becomes necessary to 
forego a bit of the park-Ii ke 
atmosp here for the functional 
aspects of a school. 

• Cost - Remember the 
lesson of those who took some 
of the jewel for themselves. In 
other words, we must not let 
grand ideas end up limiting 
universal accessibility by pro-
ducing a grand price tag. Our 
administration does not need 
advice on overspending. 

One more element is needed 
to make the other three work -
compromise. Neither aesthetics 
nor function nor cost should be 
abandoned for the sake of 
another. As it would be practi-
cally impossible to design a 
building incorporating the ul-
timate in all three, a good com-
promise has to be found . 

The Central Library con-
struction ordeal has been a per-
fect example of this process. 
Some argued for maximum 
cost-effectiveness; some argued 
for maximum function; and 
some demanded that not one 
tree should be felled in the pro-
cess. The first design was thank-
fully thrown out because it 
s hort-changed aesthetics. A 
second design was proposed 
that compromised the function 
area a little bit, but remained 
within budget and proved aes-
thetically satisfying. People 
would still argue that trees will 
be cut down in the process, but 
the neat thing is that, unlike a 
botched co nstruction project, 
trees can renew themselves with 
little or no charge to the cus-
lomer. 

Nature has a wonderful way 
of crealing whole worlds where 
beauty, function , and efficiency 
are rolled together in one pre-
cise, well-oiled package . People 
eem to think that we can 

accomplish thi better than 
nature , even though we are a 
product of it. We've found out 
that we can't, but here at UCSD 
we have the opportunity to try 
for second-best by using this 
land carefully and wisely, while 
at the same time trying to learn 
moreabout it. Afterall, second-
place is better than last-place.

he said . 

Eileen Baumgartner, a legisla-

duced the legislation, said in an 
earlier interview with the Un;-
versilY City Light that "the cap 
was designed to make the U RI 
run the way other programs run," 
and that the UR I awards were 
previously "skewed" - possible 
towa rd "an old boy network." 

Approximately 50 percent of

million went to three states -
California, Massachusetts and

Abarbanel asserts that what 
really is going on is an "anti-
California bias" because "a lot of 
researchers are moving here for 
its climate and environment and 
leaving the Minnesotas and the 
M ichigans . .. The [14 percent 
cap] percentage is an apparent 
logical invention to express that 
bias." !ill

Meeting unites faiths 
By LAURA KNAPP 
Guardian Intun 

Five religious groups from six different campus organizations gathered Thursday night at an 
Interfaith meeting in an effort to learn about each other's faith. T he three-hour meeting. spon-
ored by the Baha 'i Club. was held at the Mountain View Lounge on the Third College campus 

and was attended by about 50 people. 
"This is not a debate . This is a meeting where all religions come together and learn somethin g." 

said Margie Bulkin. the moderator of the meeting. 
The meeting also aimed at an atte mpt to replace religious divi ion with unity, and not to 

pro elytize, ince each group. whether Mormon, Jew. Muslim, Baha 'i or C hristian, already held 
strong religiou convictions. 

The format of the meeting consisted of a speaker from each group responding in turn to two 
prede ignated questions. The first que tion asked for the speaker to explain the basic tenets of the 
specific religions while the second asked to tell about the religion's perception of the natu re of 
God . After the ere ponses the Ooor wa s opened for questions from the audience . 

The spirit of unit was upheld throughout the meeting excep t for one moment in the evening 
when the moderator was forced to interrupt a speaker because she felt he was not followi ng the 
format and giving more of a testimony to h i faith than de cribi ng the basic tenets of C hristianity. 

Other than this, however, the meeting ran smoothly and the po ible problem of speakers trying 
to assert the superiority of one religion over another did not turn out to be the case. Various 
speakers add res ed this issue: "[One] can 't look to someone else to tell us what's the truth . It's not 
for me to tell you what to believe . I think it's wo nderful when we can compare notes like this," Earl 
Gaston. a member of the Baha'i Club said . 

Micah Barany. spea ker from the nion of Jewish Students stated "We recognize other 
religions . We are not going to try and convince you. If you're Christian that's fine." 

lmad Albahri. a representative of the M u lim Student Organization said, "You ca nnot force 
somebody to adopt Islam ... If you're not convinced, you're not a Muslim." 

The success of the evening was evident after its conclusion. early everyone stayed and people 
from all the different groups were busy talking to one another. Looking around the room, Gaston 
pointed to a "Mormon talking to a Christian ... various people talking with Muslim . ,. He felt the 
meeting was an experiment t hat went very well and discussed the possibility of a nother event like 
it occurring in the future, which Gaston hoped will have even more group attending. 

Most of the speaker shared Gaston's sentiments about the success of the meeting. 
When asked about his feelings on the outcome Albahri said, " It was a very good meeting, [it] 

tends to fulfill the goal ... to know about others' religion . [It] brings hearts closer together and 
uncover lots of stereotyping." 

Barany said, "[There are] a lot of things we [religions] have in common but it's only going to be 
to a certain extent." He feel there is only a point to which the groups can come together, but was 
encouraged by the fact that the meeting went with very few problems, and he felt that " the best way 
to [come together) is through dialogue and not through fighting."

Is fat where it's at? 
By KATY SMITH 
Staff Writer 

Lately, a hot health topic has been fat : What is fa t? Why is fat so bad? Are 
there any good fats? With all the 
conflicting information about 
fat, a person could become sat u-
rated in the polysyllabic world of 
monounsaturated fats . So , 
before you put that granola bar 
in your mouth, here's something 
to nibble on. 

is saturated fat. Animal fat. 
especially red meat , is high in 
saturated fa ts . Although fish and 
chicken also have sa turated fats, 
they have much less than red 
meats . Saturated fats most often 
have the consistency of a solid. 
However. coconut oil, palm oil, 
and cocoa butter (which is found 
in chocolate) also contain large

amounts . These are the things to 
stay away fro m because satu-
rated fats tend to raise choles-
terol levels , thus increasing the 
chance of heart attack. (Some-
thing to think about now, before 
it is too late.) No more than one-
third of dietary fat (or 10 percent 
of the total caloric intake) should

fats should compose no more 
than 30 percent of the individu-
al's total caloric intake.

The Med Center located in Hillcrest has only been university-
owned since 1981 . 

Medical Center 
Continued from page 1 
experienced nurse will decide if 
the "patient is rapidly deterior-
ating and need s to be sent to a 
trauma center or to a standard 
emergency room," Fridlund said . 

Medical students help with the 
resuscitations while under the 
d irection of the staff doctors. 
" We give them small jobs in the 
beginning so they can gain ex-
perience and get used to the ten-
sion," Fridlund said . This expe-
rience helps students decide if 
they want to work in high pres-
sure situations. 

Fridlund said that this job is 
for people who have a lot of 
adrenaline and enjoy being stim-
ulated and challenged. "There is 
a lot of drama in trauma" she 
said . ' 

Another life saving aspect of 
the Med Center is Life Flight, 
which is an accident victim rescue 
operation accomplished by heli-
copter. Life Flight makes 95 per-
cent trauma calls of which 90 
percent go right to the scene. The 
helicopter is set up like an inten-
sive care unit. Phillip Moom-
jean, part of the medical team of 
Life Flight believes that " It's 
[Life Flight] like having an 
t> mergency room visit right on 
the scene of the accident." 

The medical team carries more 
equipment and medications with 
them thando paramedics because 
of their specialized training. The 
helicopter can carry two patients. 
They are there to save the life on 
the scene whereas paramedics 

just take accident victims to the 
hospital without administering 
treatment. Life Flight basically 
cuts out the middle man of 
transport. They have a three per-
son crew consisting of either one 
pilot and two nurses or a pilot , 
nurse and medic. Moomjean's 
own medical experience is exten-
sive. His qualifications include 
being a registered nurse, taking 
advanced flight nurse trauma and 
life support classes and knowing 
advanced cardiac care . 

The Life Flight system works 
as smoothly as a well oiled 
machine. They have 90-100 staff 
members overall , including dis-
patcher , pilots , mechanics, and 
administrative personnel. Life 
Flight, like the trauma center, is 
always ready and in operation . 

It is a first come first serve 
priority unless there is an injury 
far away where no help is avail -
able for hundreds of miles. The 
three aircraft units run in 12 
hour shifts answering 230 calls a 
month . 

Even though Life Flight and 
operations similar to it demon-
strate remarkable recoveries , 
there are only 160- 170 programs 
across the count.y. One of the 
reasons that rr ay account for 
this is that long 12-hour shifts 
given to the crew instead of the 
usual8-hour shifts tend to cause 
fatigue which can greatly affect 
the performance and safety of 
the operation.

exte nsive operation . Eileen Cal-
lahan at public information said 
that the "main [hospital] tower 
has room for 437 beds operating 
now at 350 or more, which is a 
really high ratio ... five years 
ago, they were at 230." The Med 
Center has a dual partnership 
with UCSD where it works with 
some of the departments on 
campus. While the hospital was 
originally built in 1966. it was 
not university-owned until 1981. 

The Med Center offers a va r-
iety of different programs to fit 
each person 's particular needs. 
They have "family medicine" 
where one physician takes care 
of the entire famil y; the "out-
patient clinic" for a short term 
medical visit; and a "language 
bank" which stores 25 different 
language and dialects to aid a 
person who might be a visitor to 
San Diego and may not speak 
English . The Med Center houses 
a full-time Indonesian translator 
because of the large inOux of 
indo-chinese population. The 
Patient and Health Education 
program allows patients to un-
derstand about their medical 
problems, various options, and 
how they ca n involve themselves. 

Magnetic Resonance is a new 
technological advancement that 
puts the Med Center along the 
forefront of technology. For the 
first time, magnetic resonance 
takes pictures of tissue and mus-
cle without radiation. Wayne 
Wilson at the Magnetic Reson-
ance operation explained that 

thi s product is a new and power-
ful addition to medical science in 
that photographs can now be 
made of tissues without expos-
ing them to harmful radiation 
rays . Wilson said it works by tak-
ing images of the hydrogen prot-
ons. These photographs shown 
on large computer displays can 
be magnified to view the smallest 
fraction of a brain or spleen in 
various angles and dimensions. 

Mitra Mehrabadi. a UCSD stu-
dent, is volunteering at the Med 
Center. 
Magnetic resonance is one of the 
more powerful tools that the 
Med Center offers to help carry 
it into new di mensions of medi-
cal expertise. 

The Med Center also allows 
medical interns and volunteers 
to get hands on experience in the 
healing process of patients. Linda 
Senyshyn, Director of Volunteer 
Services believes that volunteers 
can help in many aspects of the 
hospital which will give them a 
sense of reward and personal 
accomplishment. Volunteers sup-
plement the services and the 

activities of the paid staff in 
many areas of the hospital. Some 
of these areas include : pediatrics, 
researc h laboratories. operating 
room , as well as gift and thrift 
shops. Volunteer duties range 
from running errands for the 
staff to visiti ng patients and 

as~isting with their treatments. 
While their assignments are 

generally once a week for 3-4 
hour time blocks , volunteers are 
expected to make a minimum 

became aware that this was a 
responsibility and ajob she could 
handle. 

Mehrabadi was struck by the 
fact that hospitals do not just 
ha ve patients with major cases of 
cancer or victims of heart attack, 
but that there are many different 
types of illnesses that are in need 
of medical attention. The envir-
onment must be both medically 
and emotionally healing, espe-
cially in certain cases. There is a

almost died of starvation and 
one of Mehrabadi's responsibili-
ties is to feed him. 

Mehrabadi said that "happi-
ness to me is not just tangible 
and material objects ... by help-
ing other human beings I gain a 
very special sat isfaction and joy 
and I am sure that myaccomp-
lishments at the Med Center will

i a wonderful opportunity to 
contribute so mething to others 
while at the same time being 
provided with an opportunity to

Mitra Mehrabadi , a UCSD 
freshman, has been a volunteer 
at the Med Center for over a 
month now. She is a biology stu-
dent who wanted to explore and 
see if the medical profession was 
right for her. Although she 
decided to become a volunteer 
for many reaso ns, the most 
important was to help others 
while making career decisions 
for herself and to establish so me 
va luable contacts for the future . 

While volunteering Mehrabadi 
realized that she had to over-
come some fears . For example, 
one time she almost fainted when 
a small child was loudly protest-
ing to receiving a painful injec-
tion . She realized that seeing 
such things is not as emotionally 
easy as she expected. but then 
after some more experiences she

Continued from page 8 

Don Carothers, speaker from 
the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Lauer Day Saints (the Mormons) 
brought up t.he point that at least 
One practical thing was learned 
by bri nging these groups to-
gether. Only tea and coffee was 
served at the meeting and it is 
against the Mormons'teachings 
to drink hot drinks, a fact un-
known to the Baha'i Club and 
many others. 

Gaston said it took about a 
month to plan the meeting. "The 
planning went wonderfully also. 
We're very encouraged by it." 

"] think [the meeting] stayed 
true to the spirit of unity," Bul-
kin said . mJ 

Good fat, 
bad fat 
Continued from pale I 
come from saturated fats . 

Unsaturated fats , the "good" 
fats , are found in vegetable oils 
(like corn, safflower, and soy-
bean) and should compose no 
more than 20 percent of the total 
caloric intake. Unsaturated fats 
usually have the consistency of a 
liquid . They are recommended 
over saturated fats because they 
have been shown to actually 
lower cholesterol levels . 
. A popular myth is that marga-

nne has less calories and less fat 
than butter. This is not true . 
Margarine and butter contain 
ounce for ounce , the sam~ 
number of calories and the same 
amount of fat. However de-
pend ing on the brand , marg~rine 
contains mainly unsa turated fa ts 
(the good fats) , whereas buller 
contains saturated fat s (the bad 
fats. ) 

A popular myth is 
that margarine has less 
calories and fat than 
butter. This is not true. 

To produce ma rgarine, many 
ma nufacturers hydrogenate their 
vegetable oils. Hydrogenating 
the vegetable oil s hardens them , 
a nd also makp.s them less satu-
rated . It is important to read 
marga rine la bels and look for 
liqu id vegetable o il s that are not 
hydroge na ted . The hydrogena-
t ion process defeats the purpose 
of choosing unsaturated fats in 
the first place! 

Does your inta ke o f fat exceed 
30 percent of your tot a l calori es? 
To calcula te the percentage of 
fat in your fare, mUlt iply t he 
grams of fat by 9 (because the re 
are 9 calories in a gram of fa t) 
and divide by th e total numbe r 
of ca lories. For exa mple, in a 
o ne ounce serving o f granola 
there are six grams of fa t a nd a 
tota l of 130 calori es. Six times 
nine eq ua ls 54 fa t calories , divid -
ed by 130 total ca lories equals 
.42. or 42 percent fat. That is 12 
pe rce nt more th a n is reco m-
mended ! 

All of th is " negative" ta lk

U. of Hawaii erupts over UCSD volleyball 
By MIKE FOLEY 
S taff Writer 

Coming off Saturday night's 
upset against Cal State North-
ridge, (which moved their rank-
ings from 18 to 14 nationally) the 
U CS D men's volleyba II team was 
optimistic for a good perform-
ance Tuesday against fourth-
ranked Hawa ii. UCSDdefinitely 
wanted to get some respect from 
Hawaii, who beat them badly in 
the UCS B tournament earlier in 
the season. 

The match started out very 
evenly, but with the score 6-4 in 
favor of Hawaii , the Rainbows 
started to get it together and 
were able to open up a 10-5 lead. 
Hawaii seemed to be taking con-
trol of the first game, but after a 
sideout UCSO's ick Rothman 
served an ace and had another 
tough jump serve that score a 
point to cut the lead to 10-7. 

Some great defensive play by 
UCSD led to two more points 
and cut the lead to 10-9 . 

UCSD had the momentum on 
their side, but some critical errors 
enabled Hawaii to get back in 
control, 13-9 . Again UCSO 
played tough and was able to cut 
the lead to 13-11 on a great dink 
by eUer Marco Gentzbourger 
and an ace serve by Scott Greene. 

serve gave Hawaii an easy sideout 
and they took advantage of the 
mistake to quickly close out the 
game 15-11. 

In the second game UCSO 
jumped out to an early 2-1 lead 
behind some all-around strong 
play by middle hitter John Lim. 
However, just as UCSD seemed 
to be getting back into the match, 
Carlos Bricero stepped back and 
served five straight jump serves 
that quickly turned U CSO's lead 
into a 6-2 deficit. 

From this point on, led by the 
power hitting of Damien Hard y 
and strong play of All-American 
Allen Allen, Hawaii took con-
trol of the match . After some 
substitution , the Tritons were 
never able to regain thei r rhythm. 

Hawaii won the second game 
15-4 and jumped out to a 13-2 
lead in the third game. Instead of 
giving in UCSD dug in and was 
able to run off four straight 
points behind the effective hit-
ting of Scott Greene. Hawaii 
finally prevailed , 15-7. 

The momentum was shifting 
again for UCSO when a missed 

Despite being outmatched by 
Hawaii , UCSD played well , 
especially in the first game. Even 
though the loss drops UCSD's 
record to 4-8, the team gained 
so me valuable experience against 
a top opponent which should 
help them continue to improve 
as the season goes on. IQJ No. 8 ~arco Gentzbourger sets a shot to No. 12 Even offensive spikes like this couldn't help the Paul Miller. Tritons against U. of Hawaii.

Lacrosse is one of the original 

American sports, invented by 
American Indians situated near 
the Canadian border. It began as 
a viscious game that would last 
for several days . To the modern 
sports fan it appears to be a 
fusion of hockey and soccer and 
is, to date, one of the fastest 
game on two feet. 

In the fall of 1981 , two fresh-
men from the bay area , Scott 
Hill and Dave Hammond , who 
played against each other on 
rival high school lacrosse teams, 
decided to start a lacrosse team 
at UCSD.

consisting of USC, Whittier, 
UCSD, and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. With the help of 
OMBAC Lacrosse Club's Larry 
Goodfellow as coach, the lacrosse 
men from UCSD went undefeat-
ed during the regular 1982 sea-
son and lost to Whittier in the 
playoffs. The team's overall 9-1 
record was its best ever. 

over the reigns and shaped the 
team into a contender. UCSD 
finished its third season at 8-5 
and made the playoffs, losing to 
SDSU, who went on to capture 
the Southern Division title. 

In 1985, the UCSD Lacrosse 
Team moved up from a recrea-
tion club to an intercollegiate 
sports club and , as such, was the 
first lacrosse team in California 
to become part of a university's 
intercollegiate program. An 8-8 
seaso n was highlighted by the 
team's first victory over SDSU. 

With the help of Campus 
Recreation, they called a meet-

Team was born . Hill and Ham-

The following year (1983) the 
team was accepted into the West

began competing against such 
heavyweights as UCLA, SDSU, 
Arizona State and the University 
of Arizona . Entry into this league 
changed the complexion of things 
and the Tritons ended up 5-8 for 
the season.

Lacrosse 
Continued from pale 12 
team to experience some tough 
times. They began the 1987 sea-
son with no coach and started off 
to a discouraging 1-5 record . It 
was at this point that Bruce 
Seltz, presently a lieutenant in 
the Navy and a former AII-
American at the Naval Academy 
took over as the Tritons head 
coach. With a lot of new training 
and dedication the team finished 
at 4-7-1 with a couple of close 
losses . 

The 1988 season looks to be 
the lacrosse team's best year 
since the West Coast Lacrosse 
League has taken shape. Their 
conference consists of UCLA, 
USC, Claremont Colleges, Oc-
cidental, B.Y.U ., and USD. 
UCLA is expected to be the 
Triton's toughest competition, 
yet with their best year of recruit-
ing new talent , and the expe-
rience of key returning players, 
the lacrosse men of UCSD are 
favored to win their division and 
see post-season play. 

UCSD defeats USC 18-8 

On Saturday, Jan. 30, the 
lacrosse team defeated the USC 
Trojans by a score of 18-8 in 
their first home game of the 
season. 

The Tritons jumped to an early 
4-0 lead in the first quarter with 
some quick offensive drives . 
Their momentum slowed when 
USC fought back to a 4-4 tie . 

Triton Coach Bruce Seitz 
called time out to help bring the 
team under control. The team 
regrouped to take a 5-4 lead at 
the end of the quarter. 

In the second period , UCSD 
began to pull away with goals 
from Juan Miller. Doug Shaddle 
and Chris Twomey. This scoring 
spurt , in conjunction with a 
s trong defense (led by Swen 
Ha ynie. Steve Hunt. Ned Har· 
vey and goaltender Joseph 
Brown). held USC sce reless in 
the second quarter. By halftime. 
the Tritons had an 8-4 lead. a 
\cad they never relinquished. 

Miller led the Tritons with 
four goa l and two assists and 
Brown led in goal keeping with 
14 saves during the game. [Q)

The Arts and Entertainment Section 

"Dickson: Old News From a New War" is 
a story of how the superconflict affects us all, 
in a world which lacks shelter from the real-
ity of nuclear devastation. Written by Reid 
Jensen as his graduate thesis for a master of 
fine arts degree, it will be presented in the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre from Feb. 3-7_ 

Jensen's story takes place in a small town 
called Dickson, an island off the shore of 
North Carolina. An ominous undercurrent 
has hit Dickson. Guardian Industries, the 

by adam levy 
hiatus writer 

town's lifeblood I is pursuing an insidious, 
secret weapon called the Guardian Angel. 

Jensen's play incorporates the different 
viewpoints that one would expect to find in 
such a situation_ The faction supporting the 
project is represented by the Mayor and a 
scientist, There is also a dovish faction in the 
town that is vehemently opposed to the pro-
ject and is attempting to unravels its mystery. 
Mixed up in this faction is a trace of espion-
age as Soviet spies also search for the secret, 
Finall y, there are the passive and apathetic 
people that Jensen calls "the disavowed and 
disenchanted." Said Jensen, "All of these 
factions come together and break apart in the 
course of the play_" 

Jensen's reason for writing the play stems 
from his desire to raise people's awareness to 
the realities of modern warfare, "Our think-
ing is so confused about how we feel about 
armed aggression. Perhaps 'Dickson' will 
offer audiences a new outlook on the issues 
we face," he said. 

The problem, he observed, is that people 
try to separate themselves from being emo-
tionally con nected to the realities of defense. 
Everyone wants to see the United States 
dominate the high seas and always come out 
victorious like in a John Wayne movie. The 
reality, he said, is that "technology is not 
going to lead us out of these messes. " we 
need to find other answers." 

Although Jensen's play deals with per-
tinent issues, he avoids making his play 
"too preachy" or too partisan. Using satire 
and humor, and looking at various sides of 
the issue, he trys to lampoon the left as well 
as the right, His main purpose, he said, "is to 
entertain, but at the same time put seeds of 
thought in people's minds," 

The play IS cast was drawn from members 
f thl:' theatre department's graduate pro-

gram, as are the director and the designers_ 
All performances are at 8 pm except for a 

7 pm Sunday curtain. Tickets for the per-
formance are $9 for general admission, $5 
for students, and $8 for seniors and military 
on Wednesday and Thursday night perfor-
mances, and are available at the Mandell 
Weiss Center for the Performing Arts Ticket 
Office (534-4574), from the ARTS TlX 
booth at the Spreckels Theatre and from 
TicketMaster

Deadl y lasers 
by larry weintraub 

hiatua writer 

After 25 years of recording 
and playing live, the Grateful 
Dead is currently experienc-
ing their biggest surge of pop-
ularity in their history. With 
the aid of their first gold album 
and first top-10 single, the 
Grateful Dead has been play-
ing to capacity crowds across 
the country. Along the way 
they've instilled joy in their 
long-time foll o wers (often 
referred to as "Deadheads") 
and picked up thousands of 
new fans . As if capping off a 
tremendously properous rev-
ival , the Grateful Dead has 
been immortalized in the form 
of laser. 

Having joined the ranks of 
such laser predecessors as Led 
Zeppelin and Pink Aoyd, the 
Grateful Dead now has their 
own Laserium presentation 
c urre ntly sho wing at the 
Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater 
in Balboa Park . 

For those unfamiliar with 
rhe Laserium format, the show 
consists of a collaboration of 
music with the artistry of a 
lase r show. Projected on an 
immense screen in to tal dar-
kness are laser images ranging 
fro m psychedel ic holograms 
to recognizable figures and 
images. Mea nwhile, mus ic 
fro m the featured artists is 
propelled through powerful 
speakers througho ut the thea-
te r. 

Having viewed several past 
Laserium shows, the idea of a 
Grateful Dead lase rium d id 
not sound entici ng. Howevet, 
when the lights wen t o ut and 
the image of the group's mas-
cot, a red, white, and blue ske-
leton, revolved in the center 
of the screen , there wa a defi-
nite rel-Iing that so mething 
special was in store. 

As the opening ong, "Sca-

rlet Begonias" filled the thea-
ter , it was met with a rash of 
applause from the audience. 
The grb up's logo was trans-
formed into an array geomet-
ric images entrancing the 
ctowd and blending beautifully 
with the Dead's classic song. 

What followed was an eno-
less variety of d~signs and an 
exceptionally chosen set of 
songs. Though the most weIl-
known Grateful Dead classics 
were not all re presented, 
favorites like "Hell in a 
Bucket" and "U.S. Blues" 
were illustrated with images of 
stars and flags and fireworks . 

In comparison with other 
Laserium shows, the Grateful 
Dead production seemed to 
excel in its use of new and 
more appealing designs. The 
choice of songs was captivat-
ing eve n for the skeptical 
viewer. 

When asked how this show 
differed from others, laser 
artist Brian Opiz commented, 
"With a show that is slower 
paced like this one, people 
tend to pick up more. " Opiz 
went on to say that in other 
Laserium shows, the fast paced 
music tends to cause the 
images to speed by too quickl y. 

Judging from the crowd's 
reaction , the Grateful Dead

Kottke has received many 
awards, among them a Ger~ 
man Grammy and member~ 
ship in Guitar Players' "Hall 
of Fame." 

What is so special about 
Kottke's playing is his ineor~ 
poration f many styles of 
music and his interesting right 
and left hand te hniques. He 
blends folk, bluegrass, lassi~ 
ca l and jazz tyles into his mel~ 

dies and counter~melodies 
that weave in and out of eom~ 

plex rhythms all on a 12~string 
guitar. 

"While I'm playing, things 
eem to happen automatical~ 

ly," he says. "I started to play 
early on with patterns. Then I 
learned that you can't just 
have a complete pattern -
you've got to leave things open 
for voices to weave in and 

ut. " 
Kottke will be performing 

on Wednesday, Feb. 10 at 8

cal abilities should make for a
