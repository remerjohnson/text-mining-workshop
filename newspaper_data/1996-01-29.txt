BERKELEY - Intel founder 
Gordon Moore has given $15 
million to UC Berkeley's New 
Materials Iailiative, which aims 
to create new substances for all 
areas of technology. The 
initiative, which UCB officials 
hope will raise $83 million, will 
fund building renovations and 
research programs in solid-stale 
physics, materials science, 
electrical engineering and 
chemistry. The cross-disciplin-
ary program will provide 
facilities to enable researchers to 
custom design and synthesize 
new materials. Moore graduated 
from UCB's College of 
Chemistry in 1950 and founded 
Intel Corp. in 1968.

UP, UP AND AWAY! Students May 
Have to Pay for 
Transportation 
To Detox 
DRUNK: Provision in Student 
Conduct Code allows UCSD police 
to recover time, mileage, cleanup 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

Students who are detained by the UCSD Police for 
public intoxication and are transported to the San 
Diego Detoxification Center (Detox) may now be 
required to pay the costs of their transportation, ac-
cording to Student Policies and Judicial Affairs Direc-
tor Nicholas Aguilar. 

The costs of transportation include the police 
officer's time, the vehicle mileage, cleanup and/or 
repair and other related costs, Aguilar said. 

He added that the charge - which mu t be ap-
proved or reje ted by the dean of the student 's college 
- has always been sanctIOned under the Student 
Conduct Code, although it was never implemented. 

"Unti l now, it was not een as an issue by the 
campus police because of the number of students 
being transported and the costs involved," he said. 

Aguilar, who made the final decision to implement 
the policy, said that the decision was prompted by the 
UCSD Police Department's concern over the high 
costs involved in transporting the students to Detox, as 
well as the time lost by police officer . 

"Thi sanction is no different from any other sanc-
tion in the Student Conduct Code, and the cost should 
not be borne by anyone other than the student who 
voluntarily consumed the alcohol," he said. 

Aguilar added that although the police department 
paid the costs of transportation from its budget, ulti -
mately the students are the ones who have to pay for 
transporting intoxicated individuals to Detox. 

"That is a reasonable conclusion because the pol ice 
are funded by the university, and student fees keep the 
university afloat," he said. 

UCSD Assistant Chief of Police John Dyer said the 
amount of the recharge could range from $50 to $150. 
He added that he believes the recharge policy will 
serve as a deterrent to public intoxication. 

"We have many repeat offenders," he said. " If it 
hits them in the pocketbook, it could wake up a few 
people."

According to Dyer, the UCSD Police Department

any time, so intoxicated individuals have the potential

UCSD Political-Science Student Runs for State Assembly 
ELECnON: Marshall 
senior Sean South 
hopes to take district 
By Matthew Kalinowski 
Staff Writer 

At a time when most college se-
niors busy themselves preparing for 
GREs, jobs and graduate schools, 
one UCSD student is devoting him-
self to an entirely different endeavor. 

Marshall senior Sean South has 
set his postgraduation sights very 
high. He hopes to serve as the next 
state assemblyman of the 76th dis-
trict, which includes UCSD and 
much of San Diego. 

South is officially on the ballot 
in the Democratic primary, which 
will take place on March 26, 1996. 

South, a political-science major, 
said ·he decided to run for state as-
sembly last February after realizing 
that the govemment was making 
important decisions today which 
would affect college students later 
in their lives. 

"I'm running to give voters a 
choice against the incumbent [Su-
san Davis)," said the 21-year-old 
South. "There needs to be funda-
mental change, but nobody wants to 
do it." 

South, originally from the Bay 
Area, is no newcomer to the politi-

cal arena. He can still recall backing 
presidential candidates when he was 
in the fourth grade. At age 18, South 
ran for city council in his hometown 
of Antioch and also served as presi-
dent of a community organization 
on the county level . 

If elected, South said he plans to 
reduce the cost of public higher edu-
cation by attempting to reallocate 
funds which have been designated 
to build prisons. 

"So many people are going to gel 
locked out of universities [because 
of the cost)," South said. "It's im-
portant people have the opportunity 
[to attend college)."

As a strong addition to UCSD's

university now offers a Doctor of 
Musical Arts (D.M.A.) in contem. 
porary music. 

"[The O.M.A. program] is a 
great opportunity for performers at 
UCSD," music graduate student 
Elizabeth McNutt aid. "With the 
O.M.A., performers can bring their 
academic life and performing life 
closer together. I won ' t feel that 
now I'm a flutist, now I'm a stu· 
dent." 

UCSO's D.M.A . program is 
unique from other such programs 
in the country because it special. 
izes in contemporary music. 
McNutt said because she came to 
UCSD to focus on the study and 
performance of contemporary mu· 

sic, "it will be encouraging to know 
that I'll be getting a degree saying 
just that." 

UCSD currently has two Ph.D.

A.S. STRENGTHENS 
UCSD COMMUNITY 

mid speculation that sludent government has 
run its course at this campus, we ought to con-
sider what the Associated Students of UCSD 
(ASUCSD) does for us before abandoning it 
altogether. 
A university community is an artificial com-
munity, one which is planned, contrived, 
defined, blueprinted and micromanaged by 
a bureaucratic order whose prime directive 
is to promote the welfare of the university

nity is completely different from the rest of society, 
where the dynamics of social action cannot be abso-
lutely regulated. As a result. the ASUCS - as a mem-
ber of this anificial community - must function in a 
similar fashion. 

Anificial communities demand artificial adminis-
trative structures. custom-designed to cater to the unique 
needs of the population. Freedom need not reign su-
preme here; it takes a back seat to faculty salaries, con-
struction bonds, military research: capital improve-
ments, TGs, Price Center movies, student-run media 
and ethnic clubs. 

Disjointed standards and a convoluted array of red

PROPOSED CONSTITUTION IGNORES COLI lEGE COUNCILS 
EdItor: 

On behalf of the Student Coun-
cil of Eleanor Roosevelt College 
(SCERC). we are writing in regards 
to the proposed A.S. constitution in 
order to voice conc,erns which 
would affect our constituents. More 
recognition and authority must be 
allocated to the five student coun-
cils. We contend the councils 
should have the power to: 

• delegate the fifth senator as a 
direct council representative; 

• review and approv.-proposed 
A.S. constitutions, which four-fifths 
of the college councils would have 
to pass; 

• appoint their own representa-
tives to the A.S. Supreme Coun.; 
and 

• approve, through a four-fifths 
vote of the councils, the A.S. Ex-
ecutive Budget. 

We are concerned that the pro-
posed constitution now under con-
sideration by the A.S. is too cen-
tralized to reach out to more than 
14,000 students, and that the indi-
vidual co"eges' representation in 
A:S. is not properly addressed.

Efforts of Students 
Editor: 

As a student involved in the 
"Freedom City" rally -the largest 
demonstration held at UCSD in the 

past three years - I too applaud 
U .C. President Atkinson's move to 
increase Funding for K-12 student 
outreach by 11'1>, from $18to $20 
million. But the GIMln/iQn shouldn't 
ignore the efforts of those who have 
been the greatest advocates of in-
creased outreach funding -
namely, the same activists the edi-
torial board derides in its editorial 
"Cynics of Atkinson's Plan Need to 
Put Politics Aside" (Jan. IS, 1996). 

For those involved in the No Re-
treat! civil rights coalition and the uc 
Student Associalion (UCSA), the is-
sue has never been whether to imple-
ment affinnative actioo or outreach 
programs, but the need to implement 
both. Last' August, UCSA unani-
mously endorsed a measure which 
proposed that the University of Cali-
fornia devote an additional $14.7 mil-
lion a year to fund I ,<XX> grdJate stu-
dents to teach in public elementary 
schools. Last November, Student 
Regent Ed Gomez successfully 
pressed the regents to include in-
creased outreach funding in their list 
of budget priorities. 

The increase achieved so far is 
important, but is still woefully in-
adequate. The $20 million slated for 
outreach is less than 0.2S percent 
of the UC's $9 billion budget. The 
extra $2 million is, at best, a "band-
aid solution." Pointing this out is not 
a mailer of playing politics. Play-
ing politics would be to ignore the 
fact that $20 million a year is 
grossly insufficient to meet the 
problem at hand.

Religion and Politics 
C ..... t .............. 
Editor: 

Regarding Nathan Pietila's Jan. 
18 commentary. "Christian Coali-

tion Leads GOP by the Throat," I 
would like to respond to the implied 
notion that Christianity and its 
practioners have no business "stick-
ing their noses" in American poli-
tics. 

Pietila assens that despite the 
opinions of Christian politicians, 
they should not advocate these 
policies under the "aegis" of 
Christianity. I think that it is ab-
surd to imply that the principles 
politicians fight for are indepen-
dent of their personal opinions ltT 
morality. 

Pietila then condemns Christians 
for identifying their moral system 
in their efforts to freely gain legis-
lative access in our country. Is not 
our multi-partisan government 
based on the identification of the 
system of beliefs that one holds? 
Pietila is correct in stating that 
Christianity is not merely a system 
of ethics, and does not embrace a 
particular political ideology, but that 
does not mean that it fails to shape 
the ideas and beliefs of politicians 
today. 

Futhermore, the commentary 
implies that there has been a re-
cent surge of political activism 
among Christians. Perhaps some 
of this misconception comes from 
the fact that these leaders have 
recently been dubbed as the 
"Christian Right" by the media. I 
feel obligated to point out that 
Christian politicians did not 
abruptly surface and decide to call 
themselves a Christian Right. In 
reality, Christians have panici-

pated aeti vely in politics from the 
founding of our country. Despite 
popular opinion, the basis for our 
Constitution was informed from 
a Judeo-Christian world view. 
Though Pietila may like to be-
lieve that these leaders were born 
with their unprecedented legisla-
tive ability, the truth is that their 
ideas were developed from the 
knowledge they acquired from 
sources over the course of their 
lives, with possibly the most in-
fluential source being the Bible. 

I also find it inappropriate for 
Pietila to label organizations like 
the Christian Coalition as "mili-
tant" if their only crime ispartici-
pating in the firmly established 
system of interest-group politics. 
If the complaint lies with the cur-
rent interest-group system, it is 
unfair to turn the Christian Right 
into the scapegoat. Perhaps Pietila 
should bring this objection up 
with his congressional represen-
tative and ask him to listen to his 
constituents rather than being bul-
lied by the National Rifle Asso-
ciation. 

In the end, the writer shares his 
concern about the integrity of 
Christians as paricipants in our 
political system. In my opinion, 
the integri ty of the Christian 
Right is dependent not on the 
abandonment of its beliefs in the 
political realm; but on standing up 
for their moral convictions in a 
society w!lich calls us to just "go 
with the flow."

The student government is not

Iccomplishes for the student body 
and the university community is 
feat in itself. 

Each quarter, students pay a 
fixed amount to the student gov-
ernment over and above their stan-
dard tuition. The ASUCSD appro-
priates these student fees, redis-
tributes t~e funds through various 
offices and produces - for stu-
dent consumption - services like:

According to the John Locke, 
the purpose of any government is 
to protect the natural laws with re-

country, we have defined those IS

Anyone who has utilized these

Let us imagine a university 
without ASUCSD. Instead of a 
commissioner of programming to 
organize and promote concerts, 
the administration might hire a 
professional booking agent to put 
together events he thinks students 
will enjoy. Instead of a commis-
sioner of operations and services, 
the university might hire profes-
sional managers or private firms 
to operate all student-related cam-
pus businesses. 

Instead of students voting 
~Iindly each year for a bunch of 
would-be bureaucrats, they might 
end up cuting ballots for services

system. But then I see my error. 
The UCSD community, IS has pre-
viously been stated, is an artificial 
community. Thus, its ruling body 
has to function differently than 
would be anticipated. 

Along with providing the ap-
proprilte services to an unconven-
tional community, the ASUCSD 
provides two things an administra-
tive-run government could never 
provide: representation and em-
powerment. As soon IS you take 
the "student" out of "student gov-
ernment," you are liable to get 
some outside intermediary -who 
would basically serve as the right 
hand of the administration. A~ as 
we all know, the student body and 
the administration have never 
quite seen eye to eye.

the ASUCSD - which carries, for 
all intensive purposes, its own liabil-
ity - has more freedom to operate 

Yet, I cannot recall a single 
thin, which the A.S. hu done to 
improve my experience in any 
way. Can you? 

Of course, the A.S. does allo-' 
cate a lot of money to other stu-
dent organizations, which benefits 
select groups of students. How-
ever, the purpose of a government 
is not to spend the money of the 
majority to further a bunch of 
small, individual priorities. Gov-
ernment, when it does need to 
spend money, should spend it to 
benefit IS many people as pos-
sible. This benefit need not be 
equal for everyone, but it should 
at least exist for the majority. 

unrestrictedly for the students, by 
the students. Concentrating stu-
dents' power into one body gives 
the ASUCSD the flexibility to 
wield a certain measure of legis-
lative power, while remaining re-
sponsive to students' needs. 

A.S., with its self-rule, remains 
intrinsically open-ended and much 
more cost-effective than a group 
of professional full-time adminis-
trators. It also provides a dual ser-
vice to students, who are given the 
opportunity to gain practical, 
hands-on administrative experi-
ence. The bottom line is that the 
ASUCSD provides students with 
an excellent return on their $4.25 
quarterly investment. 

Add to that the empowerment 
and representation it provides the 
student body, and you have one

For all the negative publicity it 
receives, the A.S. is responsible 
for many of the amenities which 
the administration, faculty, staff

provides basic training for those 
students who are entering the bu-
reaucratic maze of politics upon 
graduation. 

Granted, the A.S. does have its 
problems. Sometimes its members 
seem parsimonious or wasteful. 
Other times they appear to bicker 
over minor issues. But we must 
keep in mind that the A.S. is al-
ways spending money on extracur-
ricular activities for students.

are fighting over issues which di-

is often long and drawn out be-

UCSD Medical Center Opens 
Special Adolescent Care Center 
TEENS: Patients.are 
between pediatrics 
and adult medicine 
ByV ..... VMC. 
Staff Writer 

With the opening of a new Ado-
lescent Center, the UCSD Medical 
Center in Hillcrest is now able to 
better serve the special needs of 13-

to 19-year-old patients. 
Tbe new center, which opened in 

late August, was the culmination of 
several years of planning, help and 
support from the local community. 

'1'he thing that's really different 
about adolescents is that they're not 
pediatric patients, and they're not 
young adults," Nurse Manager 
Janine Dubina said. "'That's what 
this group is for,to meet the psycho-

social needs of 
these kids." 

The Adoles-
cent Center has 
several special 
facilities, in-
cluding comput-
ers with Internet 
acCess, as well as 
televisions and 
VCRs in each 
patient's room. 
Two recreation 
rooms are also 
available to be 
used for games, 
reading or orga-
nized activities 
planned by the 
staff. 

FIle Photo 
You ... lIdults: The UCSD Medical Center In 
Hillcrest features a special treatment center for 
13- to 19-year-old patients. 

The center 
stresses educa-
tional programs 
and prevention, 
in addition to 
medical treat-
menl. 

'The kids are 

usually here because of some kind 
of trauma, so we're very much inter-
ested in prevention," Dubina said. 

San Diego city schools plan to 
hold education and prevention pro-
grams at the center in response to 
rises in teen pregnancy and teen 
violence. There are also regularly 
scheduled conferences on sexual-
ity, accident prevention and healthy 
behavior. 

One goal of the cente.r is to pro-
vide an environment which is safe 
and supportive to all types of pa-
tients. Whilereceiving medical treat-
ment, patients can continue school-
work, explore new interests and get 
to know other patients their age. 

The staff is also more lenient 
toward the teens, as opposed to regu-
lar hospital patients; there are ex-
tended visiting hours, patients have 
extended phone privileges and can 
take their meals in the medical 
center's cafeteria instead of being 
required to eat in their rooms. 

"We just do things differently to 
meellheirspeciaJ needs." Dubina said: 

No special funding was provided 
for the Adolescent Center by the 
university; donations from the com-
munity, actively solicited by Pedi-
atrics Division Chief Larry

said. 

The D.M.A. program was ap-
proved by the UC Board of Re-
gents at its January meeting. 

"It took about two years to get 
the proposal through the campus 
system; and once it was approved 
by the graduate council, it went 
up to the systemwide graduate 
council and then to the Board of 
Regents," Steiger said. ''The cam-
pus graduate council was reluc-
tant to add programs that require 
new resources, but in fact, no 

department 's 
performance committee. for the 
program's existence. 

'They brought the program 
about," Steiger said. 

The D.M.A. program will be-
gin mid-February for current stu-
dents, and in fall 1996 for new 
students. Students with master's 
degrees and extensive experience 
and expertise as performers arc 
eligible to apply. 

"UCSD has not previously 
been known as a chool for per-
formers ," MeNulI said. "The per-
formers here are great , and hope-
fully . having a D.M.A. will bring 
more really good performers to 
UCSD."

Monday, January 29, 1996 The UCSD Guardian FEAnJRES II 

the 

LEGACY 
of 

After 17 years, Smith v. Regents still remains controversial 
t's a decision which has had a far-
reaching effect on nearly every 
UCSD student organization. It's a 
decision about which the politics 
have raged for nearly 17 years. 
It's a decision which has led to 

hundreds of other ambiguous decisions. 
And it's a decision in which the ques-
tions still linger, and ignorance still 
persists. " 

It ~gan this way: In 1979, Arlo 
Smith, a law student at UC Berkeley. 
questioned the allocation of his man-
datory student fees to various on-cam-
pus student groups. Smith was enraged 
that a local political candidate - one 
whom he did not endorse - was being 
funded by the Associated Students 
(ASUC). 

He led a group of G 
Berkeley students, i.U~~H:)t.N 
who ultimately chal- F ATU RES 

right-wing counterpart 
to the ACLU [Ameri-
can Civil Liberties 
Union)." lenged the ASUC's 

mandatory student 
fees supporting groups deemed reli-
gious, political or ideological. The law-
suit was filed against the UC Board of 
Regents, which represented the inter· 
ests of ASUC. Thus. Smith v. Regents 
- possibly the most innuential court 
decision affecting students loday -
was born. 

Smith and his group found legal fund-
ing for their cause in the Pacific Legal 
Foundation - which, according to Gradu-
ate Student Association President Steve 
Dubb, is"" "private corporation, and a 

, , 

AI first, Smith's 
case lost at the local court level. But 
after a series of appeals, the case was 
heard by the California State Supreme 
Court. It was not brought up until 12 
years later, in the spring of 1993. The 
court then ruled in favor of Smith, 
citing one precedent case in particular, 
Keller v. the State Baro/California. as 
the basis for its landmark decision. 

The Keller decision dealt with a group 
of attorneys and its mandatory payment 
of dues to a bar association. The plain-
tiffs were disgruntled by the use of their 

dues in lobbying on controversial social 
issues, including gun control, abortion 
and prayer in public schools. The U.S. 
Supreme Court heard the case and de-
cided that the use of dues should be 
relevant in nature, "not simply to any 
purpose the organization chooses to de· 
clare for itself, but to the p.urpose for 
whicli compelled association was justi-
fied: I 

Making reference to the federal rul· 
ing on Keller, the state court overturned 
precedent rulings and presented its argu· 
ment in favor of Smith. 

In the Keller case, the U.S. Supreme 
Court argued, "the State Bar may there-
fore constitutionally fund activities ger· 

mane to those goals out of 
the mandatory dues of all 
members. It may not, 
however, in such man-

SMITH: Smith 
restricts funding of 
organizations 
c.tInuecI ......... 11 
ncr fund acti vities of an ideologi-
cal nalUre which fall outside of 
those areas of activity." 

The state court clearly mod-
eled the restrictions on the Uni-
versity of California's use of stu-
dent dues after those reached by 
the U.S. Supreme Court in the 

K~lkr decision. 
"The solution to this problem 

is to set a rational limit on the use 
of mandatory fees. We can do 
this by recognizing what is obvi-
oUlly true - namely. that a 
group's dedication to achieving 
its political or ideological goals, 
at some point, begins to outweigh 
any legitimate claim it may be to 
educating students on the 
university's behalf." the state 
court said. 

The court decided that fund-
ing an such groups through man-
datory student fees quelled the 
speech of dissenting students. 
Furthermore. it reasoned that such 
expenditures were not accom-
plishing a necessary educational 
goal. 

As such. students - by the 
slate court's ruling - werc to 
select which of the groups deemed 
to be political. religious or ideo-

logical that they nevertheless 
wished to fund. 

The 1993 ruling also stated 
that student ,roups with the 
above qualifications were to be 
determined by Smith Review 
Boards. designated by the 
ASUC Council at each of the 
nine UC campuses. 

UCSD's A.S. Council set up 
the Student Organization Fund-
ing Eligibility Board (SOFEB), 
only after the UC Office of the 
President issued its interpretation 
of the Smith ruling. 

The UCOP articulated its in-
terpretation in March 1994 in a 
document entitled. "Guidelines 
for Implementing the ~equire­
ments of Smith V.I. R~genls." The 
UCOP reading of the decision 
pinpointed those "educational" 
organizations which were "reli-
gious. ideological or political" in 
nature. 

The UCOP stated that orga-
nizations falling in the follow-
i ng categories met Smith ' s q ual i-
fications: ballot initiatives. can-
didates seeking election or other 
political purposes; lobbying 'of 
local . state or federal officials; . 
religious services; activities in 
connection with polilical. ideo-

logi~al or religious off-campus 
organizations; and groups prin-
cipally dedicatcd to effecting 
political or ideological goals. as

According to UCSA. student 
groups across the UC system 
affected by the Smith decision 
and the UCOP interpretation in-
clude: . 

• UC Berkeley's Diatribe. an 
alternative campus publication 
which lost funding due to its in-
clusion of political opinions; 

• UC Davis's Third World Fo-
rum. an alternative paper which 
was defunded for political opin-
ions; 

• UCLA' s elected student of-
ficials. who are being recalled 
due to active involvement in the 
affirmative-action debate and the 
spending of student fee money on 
its advocacy; 

• UCSD's Amnesty Interna-
tional. which was denied funding 
because of the potential violation 
of university policies. 

In accordance with the Smith 
decision. the University ofCali-
fornia implemented a "positive 
check-off' system. "Positive 
check-offs" are the boxes on 
tuition statements which allow 
students to check Ihe religious. 
political or ideological causes 
they wish to support beyond the 
requisite fee payment.

SMITH: Smith 
still in question 17 
years later 
ContInued from ...,e 12 

However. UCSA argued that a 
"negative check.-off· system would 
result in greater funding for such stu-
dent organizations. . 

The "negative check-offs" allow 
paying students to indicate which re-
ligious. political or ideological groups 
they do not wish to support. If a stu-
dent checks nothing. then every orga-
nization gets a cut of that student's 
fees. 

"The difference in payment rates is 
astonishing. under a positive check-
off," Dubb said. "With a negative 
check. people tend to not question the 
allocation of such a relatively small 
amount of money." 

Dubb added. "The ueop was suc-
cessful in pushing back funding with 
this tactic." 

But it was not so much the reduc-
tion of funding that fueled the dispute 
between the UCSA and the UCOP. 
According to Dubb. UeOP'sattempts 
to redefine the role of UeSA under 
the Smith ruling precipitated the 
struggle. 

"To UCOP. UCSA represents the 
enemy ... and they'lI do anything to 
shut them down." Dubb said. "So. 
they used Smith as a measure to insti-
gate this." 

According to Dubb. UCOP - in 
reconsidering UCSA's role as a stu-
dent body -offered the UCSA board 
three options: 

• Tennin81e UeSA altogether; 
• Replace UCSA with a UC Coun-

cil of Presidents; or 
• Eliminate all of UCSA' s legisla-

tive lobbying ability. 
UeSA chose the third option and 

issued its own interpretation of the 
Smith ruling. It now functions through 
fundraising and various loopholes to 
fund its legislative lobbying. 

At a UC Board of Regents meeting 
in November of 1995. Student Regent 
Edward Gomez submitted Item SP-7. 
an unsuccessful attempt to overturn 
the ueop interpretation of Smith . 

SOFEB was implemented as 
UCSD's official Smith Review 
Board after the ueop interpreta-
tion was released. However.theA.S. 
Council voted to dismantle SOFEB 
earlier this month. in accordance to 
UeSA's interpretation of a recent 
federal case. Rosenberger v. the 
University of Virginia . which con-

The UCSD Guardian 

flicts with the·state-court ruling on 
Smith. 

Another measure that UCSD's 
A.S. Council started to further lob-
bying tactics was the revival of an 
A.S.-funded student lobby core. 
which lobbied for a variety of stu-
dent issues. 

"uc lobby core used to exist be-
fore the Smith ruling, as a part of 
UCSA, and there were lobby cores 
on all UC campuses." A.S. Vice 
President External Affairs Brian 
Dowd said. 

"They would lobby for students 
specifically on student issues, such 
as fees and financial aid. in the 
·SOs .... We used to be a very power-
fullobbying body at the state capi-
tol. before the UCOP interpretation 
came down. and the lobby core was 
dissolved." 

Joanna Stevenson. lobbyist for the 
A.S. Office of External Affairs. said. 
"Through UeSD. the positive check-
off and our fundraising. we're Ihe 
only functional lobby core in the UC 
system." 

After three years of various groups 
trying to elucidate the true meaning 
behind the Smith v. Regents ruling. 
one thing is certain - the battie has 
just begun.

TIMBER: 
Tritons chop Oaks 
C ......... from,...20 
range bombs. 

Sebek finished with I S points, 
on six of 10 shooting, and picked 
up two more steals to push his 
team-leading tOlalto 31. 

Minehan and Sebek's clutch 
field goals in the first half opened 
the floodgates, as UCSD ran past 
the reeling Oaks. 

A late first-half scoring binge 
by the Triton gunners stretched 
the lead to 18, and UCSD went to 
the intermission up by a comfort-
able score, 49-31. 

The Tritons came out of the 
locker room determined not to 
relinquish their lead. Freshman 
point guard Adam Libby hit a pair 
of threes during a 14-2 run during 
the first four minutes of the sec-
ond half, putting the Tritonsahead 
by 2S points. 

. With the outcome virtually 
decided only a few minutes into 
the second half, Triton Head 
Coach Greg Lanthier substituted 
freely, resting his starting five for 
much of the half. He let the sup-
porting cast share the scoring re-
lponlibilities. 

Starting center Matt Aune still 
paced the Tritons in scoring, how-
ever, pouring in 24 points in what 
wu more of a cameo appearance. 

The UCSD bench capitalized 
on t~e opportunity, stretching the 
2S-point lead to the final margin 
of S8 points. 

Sophomore forward Mike 
Ensley led the charge down the 
stretch, scoring a season-high 13 

points and pull-
ing down a 
team-Ieadi n, 
seven re-
bounds. 

"Our style is 
meant to wear 
them down," 
Ensley said.

we are," he added. 

However. if the Tritons con-
tinue their tenacious defensive 
effort and bury their"open looks" 
at the basket, they have good 
shot at beating the Panthers'. 

"It fell good," Ensley said. "It's 
a rush [when you ' re playing that 
well], and everybody wants to get 
a piece." 

While the performances by the 
Triton bench were encouraging, 
Lanthier is determined not to let 
the blowout turn into a false sense 
of security. 

"We're not going to let that 
happen. It'sa lotdifferentlo make 
shots when you're up by 40, than 
when you're down by two points. 
So it's hard to judge our perfor-
mance in this game." Lanthier 
said. 

"We have to tum around and

The UCSD squad now knows 
it can hit the open threes, as it 
sank 22 of SO three-point field 
goals against Menlo (for a tidy 
44 percent clip). 

The three-point shooting fe-
ver even carried over to half-
time, as Muir junior Huy Hoang 
won dinner for two at Islands 
restaurant by sinking a pair of 
trifectas during the "halftime 
sheotout." 

The Trito/ls look to continue 
the revenge theme this Tuesday

New York Has Its Ups, 
Downs for the Tritons 
118 APPLE: UCSD lost to undefeated Defiance 
before slaughtering a hapless team from York 
By Robin KezIrIH 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team faced the good. the bad and 
the ugly auhe ElmiraCollegeClas-
sic in New York last week-
end. 

The good: The Tritons 
battled a tough squad from 
Defiance College. The bad: 
UCSD had to brave the frigid 
cold of upstate New York. 
And the ugly: The Tritons 
smashed a terrible team from 
York College. 

The Tritons knew they had a 
tough road ahead in their first match 
against an undefeated squad from 
Defiance College on Friday night. 
Defiance proved worthy of its repu-
tation, causing numerous turnovers 
(23) and outscoring the Tritons. 45-
2S, in the fIrSt half. 

Although UCSD' s powerful in-
side player Karli Jungwinh man-
aged 13 points and nine boards, 
consistent scorers Cindy Yamasaki 
and Anne Westmoreland were 
paralyzed by the swarming Defi-
ance defense. Yamasaki and 
Westmoreland combined for a 
mere eight points in 33 minutes on 
the coun. 

Whi Ie the offense sputtered, the 
defense came out to play in the 
second half, holding Defiance to 
only 37 points. Unable to execute 
on offense. however. UCSD failed 

to tarnish Defiance's per-
fect record, losing the con-
test, 82-52. 

The tough first-round loss 
left the Tritons in the conso-
lation bracket, where an ugly 
squad from York College set 
out to prove just how poorly 
a basketball team could play. 

Destroying its lesser opponents in 
every aspect of the game. UCSD 
amassed a 72-point victory with an 
84-12 triumph. 

Back-up freshman guard Tristen 
Teasdale led the Tritons with 14 
points. while fellow youngster Amy 
McClure pitched in with eight points. 
Rounding out the offensive output, 

veteran guards 
Yamasaki and 
Marcia Jeffries 
posted 13 and 
eight points, re-
spectively. 

Every active 
Triton spent at least seven minutes 
on the court in an outing which can 
only be described as an embarrass-
ment for York College. 

The Triton women will relax on 
Sunday, checking out other East 
Coast sights besides Elmira's gym. 
They will finish the road-trip at 
William Patterson College in New 
Jersey on Monday night.

MAFIA: How 
much did Neil get? 
ContInued .... PIle 20 
gunned a tilbt spiral to the right side 
of the field, alood IS yards away 
from anyone in anything ~mbling 
a black jersey, rilht into the waiting 
arms of Cowboy cornerback Larry 
Brown. 

Brown, taking advantase of the 
first of his two Super Bowl gifts, 
galloped 43 yards down the left 
sideline - all the way to 
Pittsburgh's 18. Thirty-six seconds 
later, Emmitt Smith walked in for 
the touchdown. 

Neil had done quite well. On the 
sidelines, he started thinking about 
the house in the Florida Keys Tony 
had promised him, complete with 
an Olympic-size swimming pool and 
a batting cage for Neil, Jr. 

Coming out of his daydream, 
O'Donnell took to the field and 
forgot his. responsibility, plowing 
through the Dallas "D" for two, 
S2-yard scoring drives, which net-
ted a field goal and a TD. Sud-
denly, the Steelers only trailed by 
three. 

With four minutes remaining in 
the game and the Steelers working 
on their latest dri yeo Neil once again 
was reminded of his duty. 

"O.K., Neil. Tony says one 
more." 

Neil, feeling a hint of doubt in 
his own abilities, put both hands to 
the sides of his helmet, acting as if 
he hadn't heard. He knew Tony 
was watching. For an instant. Neil 
thought about the Lombardi tro-
phy, the. solid weight of it in his

hand and the sting of champagne 
in his eyes. 

"Don't evCQ think about it," the 
voice said calmly. Neil nodded in 
defeated acquiescence. 

Toreros Tear Tritons 
TIle Gift, put two 
Neil'smornentarydelusionssud-

denly unraveled like a cheap knit 
sweater. He wanted it to be over. 

OPENER: UCSD began the season by taking on cross-town rival USD 
on Sunday afternoon; and the Division I Toreros prevailed easily, 7-0 

Several plays into what looked 
like the eventual game-winning 
drive, Neil took a three-step drop. 
surveyed the field and spotted his 
newfound friend, Larry Brown. 

Closing his eyes, Neil lofted a 
feeble pass toward the right sideline 
and, once again, Brown cradled the 
errant throw and returned it33 yards 
to the Pittsburgh six. Two plays 
later, Emmitt skipped into the 
endzone for his second touchdown 
of the second half, putting the game 
out of reach. 

neRe".rd 
As the game ticked away, Neil 

"Benedict Arnold" looked around 
at his dejected teammates and won-
dered if they would ever suspect 
his treachery . His untimely picks 
stood out in the tapestry of the 
game like poor stitches. He stood 
alone. 

As Paul Tagliabue presented the 
championship trophy to Jerry Jones 
and Barry Switzer at midfield fol-
lowing the game. Neil shuffled off 
the field alone, eyes downcast, a 
complicitous smile adorning his 
bearded face.

The UCSD men's tennis team 

had its season opener on Sun-
day afternoon at USD; and it 

feat. 

was a tough first 
match for the Tri-
tons, as the Divi-
sion I Toreros 
dealt the UCSD 
men's tennis team 
a painful, but 
somewhat ex-
pected, 7-0 de-

Despite the loss. the Tritons' 
hopes for a good season are fly-
ing high, thanks to the return of 
four oftheir top six players from 
last year's squad. 

"We're one of the few teams 
from the West which has im-
proved." Triton assistant coach 
Robert Ho said. "A lot of teams 
have lost a lot of players, but we 
still have our core of guys here." 

Senior Dan Brounstein 
moved up to the number-one 
slot on the team after spending 
last year as the number-tw9 
man, and early on he demon-
strated an ability to keep pace 
with his Torero opponent. 

Brounstein dominated the first 
two games without losing a 
single point. However, the tide 
turned quickly, and he wasn't 
able to pull out the win, losing, 
6-3,6-2. 

Another returner, Mike Wil-
son, played in the number-three 
slot and came out of the gates 
strong, keeping the opening set 
close at 3-3. He too was unable 
to keep pace with his USD foe, 
however, eventually dropping 
the first set by a 6-4 margin. 
Wilson lost his momentum, as 
well as the second set. 6-2. 

Playing number two for the 
Tritons was senior Eric 
Steidlmayer, known for his 
powerful serve . His power 
wasn't enough to win the match. 
though, as he was handily 
outgunned; 6-1, 6-2, in straight 
sets. 

Emil Mihet, playing the num-
ber-four position, scrapped for 
every ball but still couldn't 
come out on top, as he was 
outlasted. 6-2. 6-4. 

Freshman Steve Shabel 
gained valuable experience at 
the number-five spot during 
yesterday's action. Shabe I 

played I tight match from be-
ginning to end, but his oppo-
nent won the clutch points. 
handing Shabel a 6-3, 6-4 de-
feat. 

On the doubles front. the 
number-two tandem of 
Steidlmayer and Wilson played 
well, pulling out the victory in 
the late going of the pro set, 8-
6. 

The new team up of. Ben 
Becker and Brounstein formed 
the number-one duo but didn't 
gel quickly enough to pull off 
the victory, falling, 8-6. 

Mihet and Shabel. another 
new combination at the num-
ber-three doubles slot. held their 
own for a time but didn't have 
the necessary experience to earn 
a win, losing 8-4. 

The weekend tangle with the 
Toreros was a warm-up match 
for the Tritons. With a Division 
I opponent past them, UCSD 
will prepare for its upcoming 
schedule. chalk full qfDivision 
III foes . 

"I think we ' re going to sur-
prise some teams this year." 
Becker said . ''I'm looking for-
ward to the season." 

Beneath the layers of pads, Pius-
burgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell 
could already feel the South Florida 
sun. taste the pina colada llnd hear 
the crack of Junior hitting baseballs 
in the cage. For so~e timely advice from God, see facing page.

Young Tritons Experience Life in MPSF TEST: Tritons 
coine up short vs. LB 

YOUTH IS SERVED: UCSD opened its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation schedule with a pair 
of defeats on the road to tough Division I competition from USC and CSU Northridge 

ContInued from ..... 20 
UCSD women were much more 
competitive than the scores would 
indicate. Senior Hilary Somers 
tried her opponent's patience with 
consistent baseline play at the third 
singles position. 

By D .. KrIIft 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
leam experienced an unusual sen-
salion prior to the start of its 1996 

season : winning. 
The Tritons fine-
tuned their skills 
for th e rigorou s 
Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation 
(MPSF) season -
which began last 
weekend-by par-

ticipating In the Wilfrid 
Laurier University Can-AmChal -
lenge in Canada. 

UCSD emerged from the tour-
nament with an unbeaten record 
and the title. 

Fast-forward to last weekend. 
The Tritons opened .their MPSF 
Schedule by taking on a pair of 
highly ranked volleyball powers, 
fairly typical of what can be 
termed the "NFC" of college vol-
leyball divisions. 

Despile suffering the expected 
defeats to Cal Slate Northridge 
and USC, UCSD Head Coach 
Doug Dannevik was overwhelm-
ingly enthusiastic about the 
progress. potential and depth of 
his youthful squad. 

"This is by far the most enjoy-
ab~ team I have had the opportu-
nity to coach," Dannevik said. 
"We have a lot of young guys 

who have a good understanding 
of what we need to do, and Tom 
[Black) is a legitimate alI -Ameri-
can candidate." 

Black, a 6'4" senior, led all 
players with 19 kills during the 
Tritons ' opening contest of the 
season against USC on Friday 
nighl. However, the highly ranked 
Trojans prevailed in straight sets 
(15-8, 15-8, 15-6). 

The following night's matchup 
against CSU Northridge, while 
equally disappointing in terms of 
the final outcome (a 15-8, 15-5, 
15- 1 defeat), was a marked im-
provement. 

"We passed and served the ball 
much beller and committed fewer 
unforced errors," Dannevik said. 
"We are much farther along than 
we were at this time last year." 

The Tritons also sided-out 
much more effectively against 
Northridge. In its best game 
against USC, UCSD managed 
only 22 side-outs. However, game 
one against Northridge saw the 
Tritons scratch and claw their way 
to 34 sideouts, a statistic which is 
indicative of a much more solid 
all-around performance. 

Although victory proved 
equally elusive in both matches 
this weekend, the UCSD squad 
can take heart in the fact that it is 
young and will continue to sIep-
up ils level of playas Ihe season 

progresses. 
"This team gets better with ev-

ery practice," Danneviksaid. "Just 
the improvement from Friday 
night to Saturday shows how 
much beuer we are capable of 
becoming." 

What the coach has to work 
with is a lineup consisting of more 
youth than your average nursery, 
with Black as the only senior on 
the leam. The starters include four 
sophomores and a freshman, and 
the game on Friday night against 
the Trojans was the firsl NCAA 
action for three of them. 

The four 
sophomores are 
swing hitters Mall 
Riley and Jon 
Yarri s, middle 
blocker Guy 
Mount and sec-
ond-year seller George You. The 
tournament in Canada proved to 
be a coming out of sorts for You, 
who earned all-tournament hon-
ors. According to Dannevik, the 
selling position is in good hands, 
as You and junior seiter Satao 
Minami "push one another" ·in 
practice. 

The final starter is a freshman 
who has caught the coaches' eye. 
Six-foot-six Devon Jeffcoat may 
soon be evoking memories of de-
parted Triton star Tyson Kerr, 
with his dominating stature at and 

above the net. 
Among those wailing in the 

wings for the Tritons is junior Dan 
Thomassen, a 6' 4" middle blocker 
who got plenty of game experience 
last year, including astarring role in 
the upset victory over San Diego 
State in the season finale. In addi-
tion to Minami and Thomassen, 
Dannevik has at his disposal the 
passing skills of junior swing hitter 
Brian Hunnicutt. 

A trio of newcomers to the team 
may arso prove important. Fresh-
men Jody Cook-Fisher and Kurt 
Seckington, as well as sophomore 

transfer Bill 
Sinclair from UC 
Santa Barbara, 
have already pro-
vided enthusiasm. 

"The freshmen 
can jump serve, 

and they are all loud on the bench 
and really provide the team with a 
spark," Dannevik explained. "I 
think the second six [players) are 
the key to the team. Our team 
chemistry is great, and its because 
these guys contribute." 

With depth like that, the Tri -
tons hope to make an impression 
on the stream ofDi vision I schools 
that will flow through RlMAC 
arena during this season. The wa-
ter will begin to trickle this Tues-
day, when Princeton University 
comes to town. 

Somers battled back from a 3-4 
deficit in the first set but ended up 
losing the tie-breaker and match, 7-
6, 6-3. Number-one Michele 
Malephansakul and number-five 
Susan Huberman also failed to win 
the deciding games in their doubles 
outing, 7-9. 

Huberman's singles match was 
perhaps the most agonizing defeat 
of the afternoon. After losing the 
first set, 1-6, she struggled to claim 
the second set, 7-6, and had sev-
eral opportunities to close out the 
third set before relinquishing it, 4-
6. Nevertheless, Coach LaPlante 
and the Tritons were not disap-
poi nted in the team's performance. 

"I was pleased to see them play 
so strong against [Long Beach)," 
LaPlante said. "[The Long Beach 
players] were strong opponents, 
and our mental toughness came 
through in the close matches." 

The UCSD women are already 
stepping up their level of play af-
ter the long offseason. The road 
back to the Division III National 
Championships in Virginia, how-
ever, is paved with three months 
of hard practice and challenging 
competition. 

"We need tough matches to get 
us ready," LaPlante said.

DELIRIOUS 
IV AN DELVENTHAL 

Robert De Niro 
Would Be Proud 

Corruption. 
An evil word conjuring up 

images of smoky backrooms 
where mustached New York 
mobsters plot unexpected 
eighth-round KOs, long-shots 
winning by a length - and 
now Super Bowl choke jobs. 

Tritons Topple 
Oaks, 117·65 

I mean, really, the fact that 
Tony and his gang of thugs 
bought out Neil "A Done 
Deal" O'Donnell is one thing; 
but frankly, they could have 
thought of a more creative 
script. 

BOMBS AWAY: UCSD found its range from 
downtown, hitting 22 threes to crush Menlo 

The Tool 
O'Donnell, a mediocre 

quarterback by the farthest 
stretch of the imagination, was 
the perfect instrument. Tony 
''The Mobster" didn't have a 
hard time convincing him. 

A woefully inaccurate arm, 
poor field vision and - lest we 
forget - a propensity for 
going momentarily color-blind 
during pressure situations of 
big games. These were the 
qualities sought by Tony and 
his bo¥s. 

The Drop 
In accordance with a series 

of cryptic telegrams sent to his 
hotel room, Neil drove to a 
truck stop just outside of 
Tempe prior to the game. As 
planned, Gus was waiting in 
the men's room and handed 
Neil a small yellow envelope 
containing: the earpiece. 

The Game Slap In the face: Matt Aune (center) tallied 24 points in a brief 
appearance. as the Tritons ripped Menlo College. 

By Mike Stance 
Staff Writer 

It had to happen sooner or later. 
The three-point shooters of the 
UCSD men's basketball team fi-
nally found their stroke Sat-
urday night, as they ex-
ploded in a 117-65 stomp-
ing of Menlo College. 

The Tritons reached a 
season high in points scored 
and thl ee-point baskets 
made - avenging two 
losses to Menlo College last 
season. 

Saturday night's victory, 
coupled with its win on the road 
against the Oaks earlier t~is year, 
gave UCSD its first series sweep 
of the season. 

Early on, the two teams battled 
to a standoff, as the three-point 
baskets did not come easy for 
UCSD. With the Oaks still playing 
on fresh legs and challenging ev-
ery shot, the Tritons relied on thei r 
motion offense for points near the 
basket. 

UCSD also focused on wearing 
the Oaks down with suffocating 
defettsive pressure, causing a sea-
son-high 33 turnovers. 

"We're playing a new defense 
now," sophomore shooting guard 
Mark Sebek said. "They just 
couldn't handle it. We killed them 
tonight because of our defense." 

Playing a good defen-
sive game against NAJA 
powerhouse The Master's 
College last week and shel-
lacking Menlo College on 
Saturday has made the Tri-
tons feel that if they playa 
tough, pressing dr.fense, 
they can use their depth to 

outlast most Division III competi-
tion. 

The Tritons have also imple-
mented a new motion offense, a 
strategy which will likely add to 
their success this season. 

The philosophy is to "keep 
moving, set screens and cut to the 
ball," Sebek said. "It confuses the 
defense and allows our shooters to 
get open." 

Sebek and senior co-captain 
Mall Minehan started raining 
jumpers midway through the first 
half. Minehan, a 6' 4" power for-
ward, took his man out to the pe-
rimeter and hit three huge long-

was just being himself (9-17, 
92 yards) - and that was quite 
good enough for Tony and
