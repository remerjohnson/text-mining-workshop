UCSD' teaching assi tants (TAs), tutors, 
readers and research assistants have vowed to 
strike in protest of admi nistrators" refusal to 
recognize their union, the Association of 
Student mployees (A ). 

On March 31 , the union sent cards to the 
state Public mployment Relations Board 
(PERB ), signed by C D and anta ruz 
TAs, supp rt ing unionilation. In add ition, A E 
- which is afri lated wi th the United Auto 
Workers - filed simi lar cards with P RB from 
UC Berkeley's TAs on April 2. 

After receiving the signed union cards, 
PERB compares its numbers with the total 
number of TA currently on the university 's 
pay roll to determine the degree of union sup-
port. 

According to ASE/UAW lead organizer Joel 
Beeson, the results will show that the majority 
of the universi ty 's TAs want union reprcsenta-
tion and that the widespread support for union-
ization seen in the 1993-94 filing still ex ists. 

By re-filing for uni on representation, 
Beeson sa id U SD, UC Santa Cru7., and UC 
Berkeley join UCLA, UC Santa Barbara and 
UC Davis in the campaign for co llecti ve-bar-
gaining rights with UC administrators. 

According to Beeson, asking. P RB to cer-
tify the union is just the beginning of 
ASEIUAW's goals for the ~pri ng . ASE plans to 
organile a large-scale "rolling strike," wi th 
strikes occurring consecutively at the six 

campuse~ in the spring and con tinuing into the 
fall. 

"The least of what you can expect is a con-
stant ~trike and di sruption spanning through 
spring and fall quarters," Beeson said. '" A I 
docs not want to impact only one campus but 
usc the rolling strike to di srupt the administra-
tion - not undergraduate students." 

Beeson said the union has not yet devel -
oped an ac tu al timeline for the rolling strike, 
but is imultaneously planning a campaign of

'UCSD Ranked High in Non-Reputational Quality Survey 
TOPS: Author cite 
influence of state's 
master plan 
By Leena Shankar 
Staff Writer 

In a unique and unprecedented 
nationwide study, UCSD ranked 
first among public institutions in 
cience productivity and eighth in 

overall per capita research produc-
tivity. 

The tudy, "The Ri e of 

J 
American Research Universi ties: 
Elites and Challenger in the 
Postwar Era," take a novel 
approach by ranking school based 
upon their research activi ties 
instead of their reputations. 

Conducted by Hugh Graham, a 
Vanderbilt Univer ity profe or, 
and Nancy Diamond, a graduate 
student at the University of 
Maryland, the survey ranks public 
and private institution eparately. 

'The central argument of this 
book i that new research universi-

ties did emerge from the competi -
ti ve scramble after 1945 to chal-
lenge, more successfully than has 
been recognized, the hegemony of 
traditional elites," the authors 
wrote. ''To orne extent, this suc-
cess has been obscured over the 
years by the strong tradition of the 
ratings game." 

UCSD Chancellor Robert 
Dynes acclaimed the tudy for its 
new methods of evaluation. 

"Though no survey i perfect, 
what sets this one apart from others 

i ' that it uses objectivc measures 
rather than reputation to come up 
with its results," he said. "In this 
manner, this survey levels the play-
ing field a bit for both mailer uni-
vcr ities and younger universitie 
founded after World War II." 

UC Berkeley, UCLA, and 
UCSD all ranked in t!J,! top 10, 
while all the other UC schools 
ranked within the top 26. The study 
examined 203 American universi -
ties utilizing everal criteria,

Students Help Find 
'Radical Fringe' Gene 
RESEARCH: Gene is instumental in the

By Alex Gorman 
Staff Writer 

Two UCSD undergraduates 
recently catapulted into the ranh 
of the ~c i entifi c elite when they co-
authored a paper puhlished in the

school year, and

now end in abortion. 

Accordi ng to do tors, ECPs do 
not have the same effect as abor-

'Super Greenhouse Effect' Found 
WEATHER: Valero 
hopes re earch will 
shed light on climate 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Scri pps Institution o f 
Oceanography sc ientist Francisco 
Valero 's groundbreaking research 
into what he has dubbed the " uper 
greenhouse effect"· may shed new 
light on the forces contro ll ing 
global climate. 

Vale ro, director o f Scripps' 
A tmospheric Research Lahoratory, 
said the effect is cau cd by warmer 
surface temperatures in the eart h's 
tropical regions. 

The higher temperatures eau e 
water to evaporate from the ur-
face and form a " blankel" over the 
oceans. By reflecting heat back to 
the ocean surface, the water vapor 
further increase the surface tem-
perature and causes even more 
water to evaporate. 

However, Valero said there is 
no danger of the reaction getting 
out of contro l. 

" Nature has its own thermo tat-
ic control to prevent runaway reac-
tions," he said. "The oceans are not 
going to boil away." 

When the concentrati on o f 
water vapor in the atmosphere 
reaches a certai n point, clouds 
form and block the reaction. 

Valero noted that the wide-
spread fear of increased atmos-
pheri c carbon dioxide causing 
global warming is actually untrue. 

However, Valero said carbon

dioxide docs act as a trigger for the 
greenhouse effect by raising the 
ocean surface temperature just 
enough to stan large-scale evapo-
rati on. 

The study is significant hecause 
the ocean are bel ieved to have a 
widespread effect on glohal cli-
mate. 

" Oceans are one of the funda-
menta l regul ators of climate on a 
global scale," Va lero said. "The 
tropics have

Nicholas Graham. another 

Scripps researcher, helped estab-
Ii h the l ink between Pacific Ocean

been directl y 
observed, can be 
seen in a II season

Val e r o ' s

lished in a recent

based on data co l-
lected in March 
1993 in a month-

Director gat ion called the 

Atmospheric Research Central Equatorial 
Laboratory P ac i f i c 

of the tropical Pacific, Indian and 
A tl antic Oceans - wi thin 20 
degree nonh or south of the equa-
tor. 

" What is important here is that 
thi s effecl covers such large 
expanses of ocean," Valero said. 
" If it were j ust a small reg ion, it 
wouldn ' t matter - but when you 
have something occurring over 
more than hal f of the tropical 
ocean, it is significant for the plan-
et." 

Valero said he hopes to gain a 
greater understanding o f the 
processes regulating the global cli-

Experiment. 
Valero and his team measured 

the level of infrared radiation emit-
ted by the oceans at three different 
altitudes using a NASA U-2 (the 
former top-secret spy plane), a 
Learjet and a National Oceanic and 
Atmospheri c Admini stration P-3 
Orion reconnaissance plane. 

The U-2 gathered data from 20 
kilometers, almost in the lower 
stratosphere. The Learje t took 
measurements simultaneously in 
the troposphere at 10 k i lometers, 
and the P-3 Orion collected similar 
information very close to the 
ocean's surface.

UCSD is ranked 
eighth overall 
Continued from page 1 
including federal research grants, 
the number of anicles published in 
scholarly journals and the number 
of faculty fellowships in Ihe arts 
and humanities. 

"Much of Ihe UC uccess may 
be allributed to the distinctive 
allure of California's climat e, 
economy and cultural myslique in 
Ihe postwar era," .Ihc aUlhors 
wrote. "But considerable credit 
must go to the Slate's visionary 
higher education policy, as codi-
ficd in the 1960 Master Plan." 

The state's Master Plan for 
Higher Education set ou t Ihe role~ 
of the state's three public higher-
education systems the 
Uni versity of Ca liforni a, Ihe 
California State Universily and the 
local community co lleges. The 
plan also guaranteed access 10 
higher education for all qualified 
California high-school graduates. 

When compared to private 
institutions in terms of science 
productivity, UCSD's facully 
ranked fou rth, behind only 
Cahech, Stanfo rd and MIT. 
Schools like Harvard, Princeton, 
Yale and Iohns Hopkins followed 
UCSD in the science ranking. 

Besides ranki ng first in sci-
ence, UCSD ranked 10th in the 
arts and humanities and 191h in the 
social sciences. 

UC Berkeley ranked firs t 
among all public universi ties 
across all disciplines, while UCSD 
tied for eighth pl ace with the 
University of Indiana. 

Stanford was rated the top pri-
vate un i versity across all disci-
plines. Following were Princeton, 
the Universi ty of Chicago and 
Harvard (tied for third ), Yale, 
Columbia and Duke (tied for 
sixth), the University of

UC San Francisco was nOI con-

SOAPBOX 

Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Journal ists 
need a little 

respect 
A couple of slalT meetings ago, 

someone decided that I should 
write Ihe edi lor's soapbox Ihis 
week. I protested, afraid Ihal I 
wouldn' t have anything to say. 
However, no one bailed me out 
and so hcre I am. Luckily. I do 
have something to discuss. bUI il 
involves talking about myself a 
bil. So, you might want 10 stop 
here and find something else to 
read if you' re tired of self-
servi ng , woe-is-me col umns. 

The problem with working for 
a newspaper is that it is a largely 
invisible, thankless lask . Thai is, 
until we makc a mislake and the 
excrement hils the fan . We can 
write tens, hundreds_ or even 
Ihousands of perfecl slories, nut 
nonody seems to remember Ihem 
when Ihings go wrong. Wc do ou r 
best, but we are only human . 
Every now and then omething is 
going to slip past us - and God 
hclp us when il does . 

Somelimes I wonder why I 
ever got into journalism in tne 
first place. II sure wasn'l for the 
money, and the company car is a 
golf cart that 's seen beller days. 

I think the reason I origi nally 
became inlerested in journalism 
was that il offered me a chance 10 
make a difference. The idea thai 
my words would shape people 's 
views of Ihe world appealed to me 
then, and it till does today. 

Too many people go through 
Iheir five s without leaving any 
so rt of mark, or making any real 
difference. Maybe I'm an idealist 
for thinking I can change Ihe 
world, bUI we'll see what 
happens. 

The average working life is 40-
odd years. I could spend Ihose 
years stuck behind a desk, pulling 
in a six-figure salary like some of 
my engineer friends plan to do. 
Instead. with any luck, I' ll be out 
in the real world. Sure. l' 1I spend 
a few years al the copy desk 
rewriting press releases. but

Fourth SOO: Anal Sprint 

The final 500 meters separates 
the novice from the veteran, the 
ded icated from the dilettante. With 
the finish linc in ight, tired crews 
cran k up their stroke rate agai n. For 
stragg lers. a risky, high- flying 
sprint is the only hope of gaining 
ground lost in the fi rst 1500 meters. 
For those strugg ling neck-and-
neck, the spri nt is a full -pressure 
game of "chicken." both charging 
along the edge of their performance 
envelopes and sacrificing perfect 
fo rm for raw speed. As the boats 
storm down the finish line. every 
crew fights hard to squeeze out the 
last bit of performance. fighting to 
be the fi rst to torpedo its boat 
through the linal buoys. 
Men 's Crew 

With the loss of head coach 
Doug Thiemann last year, UCSO's 
men's crew was unable sustain its 
varsit y team. With brand-new 
varsi ty coach Michael Filipone and 
a varsity squad comprised mo tly. 
of last year 's novices, thi s year's 
Men's Varsity crew has already 
achieved some fairly impressive 
results. In their fi rst race agai nst 
Irvine, UCSD's newly resurrected 
varsity squad scored a victory 
against established UCI in a head-
to-head duel. 

In the Cal Cup races, the fierce 
competition in Heat A left UCSO 
with a seventh-place fini sh, even 
though the Varsity squad pulled an 
impressive 6:08.10. Heat B proved

time, edging ahead of Paci fi c 
Lutheran ' 6;.'22.30 and placing a 
respectable fi fth place. behind 
Virginia. Sacramanto State, Trinity, 
and Santa Clara. 

In Men's College Novice races, 
UCSO pulled a 6:53.78, placing 
seventh behind Cal. Orange Coast, 
US O, Wash ington State, Long 
Beach State, and UC Oavis. 
Women's Crew 

UCSD Women's Varsity bene-
fits from the long, unbroken 
coaching effort of its head coach 
Jack Vallagaha. The result how: 
UCS O's varsi ty women placed 
third (time: 7: 10.86) in their Cal 
Cup heat. ahead of two Division I 
schools, USC (7: 18.89) and Texas 
(7:32.00) . In Novice A, Heat B, 
UCSO's eight-woman crew pulled 
a 7:55.91 and placed fou rth. ahead 
of Chapman (7:59.37), Oregon 
(8:05 .27) and Mills (8:41.75). 
Elsewhere, in the Women's College 
Nov ice A Petite. UCSO charged 
ahead with a 7: 14.94, enough to 
earn a fourth place ranking behind 
Stanford (7 :00.95), Washington 
State (7 :02.47), Orange Coast 
(7:06.30) and beat the women from 
SDSU (7: 15.26) and UC Irvi ne 
(7:2 1.89). 
Pure Athleticism 

There are many reason to 
participate in ath letics, part icularly 
at the intercollegiate leve l. As 
debate still rages about UCSO's 
possible move to Division II status 
and the consequences of 
scholarship athletes on the school, 
it is clear that money and prestige 
still loom large in the minds of 
many would-be collegiate ath letes.

Hard at work: The UCSD Varsity Women's crew team practices at Mission Bay in preparation for the 24th 
annual San Diego Crew Classic held th is past weekend . 

But what could motivate a 
co llege student to dedicate every 
early-morning hour for an entire 
academic year to rowing? It is 
surely not ror scholarships or fa me. 
While football , water polo, soccer 
and other athletic pursuit (most 
notably in Oi vision I schools) orrer 
their athletes more generous 
incentives, those in crew train 
harder for less recognition, often 
racing in relative anonymity. 

Looking for glamour, fame, an 
easy varsity letter and a pampered 
schedule during your co llege 
years? Looking for a post-college 
career of free 'agency, multi -
mi Ilion-dollar spon sorship con-

tracts and celebri ty endorsements'! 
If so. don 't bother to pick lip an 

oar. 

Rowers answer to an older, 
pllrer call : the exhilarati on or a full -
pressure neck -and-neck spri nt to 
the finish line agai nst a bigger. 
stronger squad; the raw thrill and 
aching muscles that accompany the 
effort to push yourse lf beyond your 
self-perceivcd limits; the roar of 
blood as your hea rt sc rea ms 
beyond 180 beats per minute (bplll) 
during a six-and-a-half-minutc 
heat; the magic moments or 
sy nchronicit y when eight 
individuals, some stranger just six 
months ago, move in perfect , 

2FO~~~t~~ceptives 

si multaneous harmony to propel a 
pencil-thin boat to victory. 

Rowers arc a special breed of 
athletes : dri ven by a so litary 
p,lssion for perfection in a craft 
large ly unappreciated in the 
shadow of more glamorous 
interco ll egiate sports. Why drag 
one's weary body out of' bed every 
morning at such obscene hour? 
Why push oneself every day to the 
brink of one's physical limits in 
grueling practice rows? 

Athletic passion. 
And that 's one thing about crew 

you' ll never learn in any game or 
Trivial Pursuit.

This week UCSD students will be asked to 
choose their student leaders for next year. 
Below is a description of the A.S. offices.

, 

When electing students to sit on the Associated Students council, it 
is crucial to choose candidates who have the character and experierlce 
requi red of a student leader. 

The commissioner of academic affairs is the student body 's main 
voice in the Academic Senate. This person oversees issue of academ-
ic dishonesty, student-professor complaints and policy changes con-
ceming class units, enrollment limits and add/drop/change deadlines. 

The commissioner of communications is responsible for AS. fund-
ing for alternative media. These include altemative newspapers such 
as the Koala and the A.s. -produced SYllergy, KSDT radio and Student-
Run Te[evision (SRTV). This person is responsible for timely publica-
tions and broadcasts, as well a relaying budget and operation infor-

m~tion conceming these media to the A.S. council. 
The commissioner of student advocacy is responsible for under-

standing the Student Conduel Code and rcpresenting students before 
Ihe Judicial Board. The role of the student advocate is also to infoml 
tudcnts of their rights, to explain the conduct code in a clear manner 

and to work on preventing vio lations. 
The commissioner of programming is responsible for providing 

students with educational and entertainment events. A candidate for 
this position should have music-industry experience in booking 
events. The A.S. programmer should work wi th the programmers of 
the five colleges to coordinate events, and should program events that 
coincide with students' interests. 

The commissioner of operations and services is essentially the 
bu ines head of all A.S.-owned and -operated serviccs. This person 
shou ld have experience dealing with A.S. businesses such' as the 
Grove Caffe. Soft Reserves and Lecture Notes. This commissioner is 
also responsible for oversight of the UCSD Co-ops. 

The vice president of finance is the chief financial officer of the 
AS. This person heads the fin ance committee and makes funding rec-
ommendations to the A.S. council based on hearings held in that com-
mittee. The vice president of finance must be extremely organiz.ed, 
know[edgeable about finance and should have prior A.S. experience. 

The vice president of extemal affairs serves as the liaison between 
the student body and the community and state official s. This office 
deals with issues like affinllative action, financial aid and student fees. 

The vice president administrative, to be renamed vice pre ident 
internal if the constitutional amendment passes, leads council meet-
ings and helps bind the various offices together. This person should be 
extremely organized, have leadership ellperience in controlling meet-
ings and a working knowledge of parliamentary procedure. He must 
also Ii II campuswide commiuee positions in a timely manner. An intri-
cate working knowledge of A.S. is necessary for this position. 

The president represents the student body to both the administra-
tion and the outside community. The president works on issues both 
intemal and extemalto UCSD, and the president is the only elected 
position that can be considered a pub[ic-relations po t. Previous A.S. 
experience and a fair amount of charisma are prerequisites for per-
forming well in this office. 

Last week, Guardian editors and other staffers interviewed nearly 
all of the candidates for the office of the president, and the vice-presi-
dential and commissioner positions. (The Guardian did not interview 

and does not endorse any senatorial candidates.) FOnller A.S. 
council members also attended the interview, asking point-

ed questions of the candidates. The editorial board considered 
leadership experience (especially prior AS. experience), com-

munication skills, platform and whether candidates showed up 
for their interviews as the most important factors. 
The recommendations contained herein reflect the majority vote 

of the editorial board and do not necessarily represent the views of the 
entire Guardian staff, the ASUCSD, or the UC Board of Regent ,

14 OPINION The UCSD Guardian A.S. Election Special 

GUARDIAN EDITORIAL BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS 

The candidates at the top of the Revolution ticket show considerable leadership promise 

In 1996, the Students First! slate rode into office on a wave of voter 
discontent aimed at the factionalism and infighting that plagued the pre-
vious Associated Students council. The prevalent wisdom wa that if all 
of the candidates could decide to put their namcs together on a single 
slate, they could certainly work together in the day -to-day operation of 
the council. 

However, in -fighting continued to be a problem this year. For vari -
ous reasons, scveral co'uncil members elected on the Students First

' 
slate 

chose to quit their positions before their tcrms eKpired. 
Once again , ea h of thi s year 's presidential candidates have claimed 

that he would ride into office on a proverbial white horse 
and put an end to the chronic factionali sm that 
plagued the A .S. in years past. Each of the three 
presidential hopefuls hrings a different set of 
s kill~, a distinct assortment of eKperiences 
and a unique cadre of prioritie~ to the princi-
ple A.S. ortice. 

Whoever prev:lIls will need the full 
range of IllS , kills to deal with the normally 
tricky hus,"e,s ot running the A.S. ~ouncll , 
as well a, the complex is,uc, that will indu-
hitably pop up over the course of the year. 

Not surprisingly, Raza's top priority, if elected, would be to refonn 
the process of student-organization funding . Raza was particularly non-
plussed by the fact that the Committee for World Democracy has a year-
ly line-item allocation for $21 ,000, leaving the more than 250 other stu-
dent organizations to contend for the remainder of the funds . Raza was 
also adamant that he would do whatever was in his power to move-
ahead the construction of a centrally located parking structure. 

Raza advocated both the non-binding referendum supporting the 
move to Division II and the Sports Club Fee, while remaining neutral on 
the issue of constitutional reform. However, Raza was against the 

UCSNUSSA fee . and said he would look at its defeat as a 
mandate from the student body to cut back on current 

levels of funding for those two organizations. 
The third candidate, Roosevelt junior Alex 

Muir junior Sou Icy Diallo. who is head-
ing u(lthe Revo lution slate, has extensive 
o perience in hoth ,tudent government and 
student organi/ations. Diallo has Ileen Sauler Dialla 

T. Tom, head of the Students Fir!ll.! slate, 
brings with him an extensive amount of 
experience with AS LJCSD and UCSD stu-
dent government. Tom served as the chair of 
the Roosevelt College Council, an A.S. sen-
ator, a UCSA boa rd rcpresentati ve and is the 
current A.S. vice preSident external. Tom 
has also been involved with the College 
Democrats. the Asian Pacifi c Islander 
Student Alliance and the Partners At 
Learni ng program.

IF(,/Panhe llcnic and hi s fraternity. Diallo's particI(lation in student gov-
ernment includes the Muir (,o llegc ('ounci l, Muir college senator, com-

In his Interview. Diallo stre»ed the Revo lution slogan of "rea l "sues.

lations hi , numhcr·one priorit y, while abo putl ing effort toward

In dea ling wllh the problem of mallltallllng and IIlcreaslllg student

platl orm takes a more radical hent . Instead 01 asking the state Icgi,laturc

ate a "co llect ive empowerment" for LJCS D students. 

For ca mru~- rclatcd Issues, Tom wanted to make a committee com-
posed of IIldlvid ual co llege council and programming chairs to improve 
the quality of programming events. He also wanted to increase A.S.

Improve tile quality of everyday life at UCSD. 

In many respects, vice president administrative is the 
most important position on the A.S. council. The vice 
president administrative runs council meetings, sets the 
council's agenda and oversees the commiuee system. 

There are three candidates rUllning for the position 
this year - bul we believe only one of them is wonhy 
of serious consideration. 

The first candidate is David Fitzgerald, 
running on the Revolution late. 
Fitzgerald has plenty of A.S . experi-
ence, having served as Revelle 
freshman and sophomore senator. 
As the council's sole representa-
tive on the administration-domi-
nated Transportation Poli cy 
Committee, Fitlgerald success-
fully engi neered the release of 
empty faculty parking spaces for 
student u e. 

De la Cruz sees the position as a liaison between the 
council and the UCSD administration. She wants to 
increa e lines of communication both within the council 
and with the outside community. 

While de la Cruz has gained significant A.S. experi-
ence as Marshall freshman senator and president pro 

tempore of the A.S., we feel she is still unprepared for 
the rigors of running the council full-time and 

controlling opposing factions. 
Fitzgerald, on the other hand, has 

interned in the Washington, D.C. 
office of a prominent and contro-
versial member of Congress. If 
the political lessons learned in 
that office were not exercise 
enough in connict resolution and 
mediation. there is no hope for 
him. 

However, what th e new vice 
president pl ans to do is perhaps 
more important that what he or 
she has done in th e past. 
Fitzgerald has both down-to-

Trung Truong, the third candi -
date for vice president admini s-
trative, is running independent of 
any slate. Truong pledges results 
in his candidate statement, but 
how much can we trust someone 

earth and lofty objectives. ranging from increasing stu-
dent representat ion on campuswide committees to nego-
tiating for a share of the UCSD Bookstore's profits. 

The second candidate, Joy de la Cruz, is running on 
the Students First! slate. Students First! campaigned last 
year on the promise of accountabi lity, advocacy and 
change . and voters put slate members into ortice acros;, 
the ~rd. 

Experience is key for thc vice president of finance. 
Qualified candidates need to possess extensive experl ' 
ence dea ling with the A.S. Finanec Committee and a 
good track record handling other peoplc's money. 

Teddy Tsai has experience In the latter category, 
havmg received hi s stockbroker's license at 
the tender age of 18. However, he has no 
cxpcncnce working inside the A.S. 
Whlie he has dealt with the A.S. on 
fu nding i;sucs while servi ng in hi s 
capacity a, vice president internal 
lor the Chmcse Culture Club, he 
has no direct ex perlcnce on the

lommlltec for World Democracy and its film series. He 
als<l expresses skepticism toward funding the operating 
hudgets of student organizations (such as fraternities and

in the student advocate's offi ce.

Studelt AIIYocI" I Phillip Musashi Herlaldez 
More than any olher A.S. officer, the 

commissioner of student advocacy has the 
capacity to dramatically affect the lives of 
UCSD students. When students get into 
trouble for violations of the alcohol, acad-
emic dishonesty or computing policies, 
they head to the office of the student 
advocate for help. Depending on the skills 
of the student advocate, punishment can 
be plea-bargained or even avoided alto-
gether. 

Mirissa McMurray, a freshman from 
Revelle, has extensive experience with 
mock trial, and would for this reason be a 
good student advocate. However, she has 
very little A.S. experience or firsthand 
familiarity with the Office of Student 
Advocate. McMurray will be a great stu-
dent advocate in the future, once she gains 
more experience. 

Charles 1m, by contrast, has even less 

experience with the A.S. and no experi-
ence as an advocate of any kind . 
Unfonunately, a lack of experience seems 
to be the only theme for the Firestarters 
slate (0 which he belongs. Slate are good 
in that they can bring together like-mind-
ed candidates, but the danger is that they 
can also serve as a cover for a lack of 
experience. 

This race really comes down to Tesh 
Khullar and Phillip Hernandez. Both have 
experience in the offiee of student advo-
cate. Hernandez is currently the issues 
coordinator in that office while Khullar is 
currently the assistant student advocate. 
Both see the need to produce some kind of 
manual to which students in trouble can 
refer. Hernandez has taken the initiative 
on this front, having already started pro-
duction on such a manual. 

Hernandez, by all indications, is very 

ComlRlnications I Valerie Grant 
Alternative media outlets at UCSD 

have recently experienced a myriad of 
changes. This is the first full year that 
SRTV has been in operation, and the A.S. 
has just started publication of its own 
newspaper, Synergy. 

Alternative publications such as the 
Koala, the People's Voice and the UCSD 
Review have seen beller days. We are 
lucky if wc ee these media publish once 
per quarter. In the old days, three or four 
years ago, the alternative-media racks 
were filled with frequently published 
newspapers. Now, apathy reigns supreme. 
This is a time of transition for alternative 
media . The co mmunicati ons offi ce is 
Iherefore in need o f some dynamic leader-
ship. 

Jacklyn Sam i an outgoi ng and per-
sonable first-year eeonomics major at 

Eleanor Rooseve lt College who gained 
experience with student government from 
her high school days. Since entering col-
lege, she has worked with the physica lly 
challenged through the Best Buddies pro-
gram. 

Sam recognizes that the five-COllege 
system tend to sp linter the campus com-
munity. and she would make bringing the 
campus together a priority. To thi s end, 
she proposes an effort to centrali ze the 
informati on-dis. emination effort by 
improving and expanding, among other 
things, the A.S. publication SYllergy. 

Sam's enthusiasm and ideas are 
impressive, and her limely appearance at 
her interv iew far out shined the nakiness 
of Michael Weigele of Firestarters. 

However, Valerie Grant, a third -year 
Urhan Studies and Planning major. also 

Acadellic AHairs I Pat Ru 
The person in this position is responsi -

ble for addressi ng issues concerning aca-
demic relation and is the student body 's 
main voice in the academic senate. This 
commissioner needs a thorough know l-
edge of academic issues and a good rap-
port with members of the facu lty. 

Revolution candidate David Freeman 
has considerable student-government 
experi ence. He served as Muir 's fres hman 
senator last year and is currently a mem-
ber-al-Iarge of the Muir College Council. 
He serves in a leadership capacity in hi s 
fraternity, and has heen a member of the 
bookstore committee. Hi s goa ls for the 

po ition include more rep resentati on in 
the Academic Senate, ex tending the " W" 
drop deadline , improving teaching on 
ca mpus and improving student/teacher 
re lations. 

Freeman's goa l of more representation 
in the Academic Senate must be con~id ­
ered a pipe-dream at hest. Although hi s 
opponenl , Pat Ru , also wan\; to extend the 
drop deadline, commissioners have tried 
to ram thi s through the Academic enale 
for many yea rs to no avai l.

ProgramlRing I Kath, Lee 
The (..()m mi~~ i one r of programming i 

responsible for al l of thc events that the 
A.S. put; on - be they educational or 
entertain ing in nature. The main events 
wi th which the A.S. Programmer concerns 
herself arc TG concerts, other big musica l 
events and movies. 

Although the Sun God Festi va l 
Committee is chai red by someone other 
than the commis~ioner of programming, the 
enonnous number of events for which the 
commil>sIoner of programming is responsi-
ble makes thi s a very imponam position, 
and one thaI has obvious relevance to the 
college expertence of most students. 

All three or the candidate running 
again ~t incumbent comnli s ioner Kathy 
Lee arc unanimou~ with regard to one 
a<,pcc t of programming: TGs. According to 
the challengers, TG~ are too frequent and 
have been unable to allraet big-names for

like more qualit y and l e~), quantity.

that there were too few TGs. This isn' t to 
di smiss the concerns of the chall ngers, but 
it does r<ti st: the i sue of what a con~ i s tent 
TG po licy shou ld look like. 

While athan Young has some interest-
ing ideas about programming (later starts 
for TGs, morc shows at Porter's Pub, fewer 
ska bands, bring back the Reggae Festival ), 
hiS lack of experience puts him behind 
incumbent Kathy Lee's qualili cati ons. 
Sean Senn (of the Fireslarters slate) also

OPINION IS 

organized, clear-headed and well-spoken, 
but hi s personality is unusually phlegmat-
ic for a student advocate. Khullar is very 
out-going and would be a very fiery advo-
cate, but he is too focused on gelling stu-
dents off the hook rather than preventing 
problems before they happen. 

Hernandez sees the need to educate 
students on how to stay out of trouble in 
the first place. He also sees the need to 
talk to first-year students directly, rather 
than just telling their RAs about the judi-
cial process. 

For his initiative in starting production 
on a student conduct manual, for his expe-
rience as issues coordinator in the student 
advocate office and for his laudable effort 
to prevent problems before they happen. 
the Guardian enthusiastically endorses 
Phillip Musashi Hernandez for commis-
sioner of student advocacy.

endorsement. Grant has leadershill experi-

cantly has experience with broadcast jour-

school dedicaled to the same. 

SRTV needs an experienced hand like 
Grant to help develop opportunities for 
students in the communications industry. 
She also expressed a desi re to see "Greek 
Col umns" return to the pages of the 
Guardian and to diver ify the format of 
KSDT. 

Grant 's new ideas for student media

16 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, Apri I 7, 1997 

The following remarks from presidential candidates were edited for length and clarity 

Aamir Raza Alex T. Tom 
"I will say what I believe and what the students have 
told me is important to them ." 

"The A.S. needs to do more active outreach and make 
that a commitment."

Having been the roller-hockey club president, 
I know how 10 work closely with sludents. I feel 
the current A.S. has gotten away from thaI. They 
are too busy working on these big issues and they 
never aclually talk to us, !he students, to see how 
we think ()( feel. Because of the way !he elections 
are run here, with an elected slate. a lot of contact 
with the students is lost. People get into office nOI 
necessarily because of !heir individual beliefs, but 
just based on the fact that they're with Students 
Firsl! or Revolution. That is why I am running 
independently. I have a very good rappon with my 
club members, and I know that I can have the 
same as A.S. president. 
..... wII lie your ....... priority • A.S. 
..,11'" • lit? 

The biggesl issue is funding organizations. 
There are places in the A.S. budget where Ihey are 
spending money where they don' t necessarily 
have to. There is one club thai receives $20,000 a 
year, the Committee for World Democ racy 
(CWD),while the other 250 must share Ihe remain-
ing $ I 00.000. I lhink Ihat that is wrong. The 
money should be split belween ,til the clubs equal-
ly. S , increasing club funding would be the 
biggest thing I woutd be trying to accomplish. 
You .. y In your .Iectlon stat.-nt tlult 
you would Ilk. to Incr ... club fundlnc 
by 11 to 20 percent. Wher. would you

The primary cutb:lck would be in Ihe 
Commillce for World Dcmocmcy. They are not 
receiving student organizalion money right now. 
TIley have a special exemption in the execulive 
budge!. 

Also, the UCSA fee proposal , if thai pa~scs, 
will no longer usc m ney oul of A.S, budget ; Ihe 
money for UCSA will he locked in. That is 50 
cents per sludent - which comes 10 $7.000 more. 
If il doesn' t pass, the students arc saying that it is 
nol important enough 10 pay for it directly. and in 
thai case, we could cut the UCSA budget wilhin 
the A.S., and perhaps not be a member nexi year. I 
feel Ihat it is nOi wonh Ihe $20.000 for just the 
membership dues,That extra money would allow 
us to in rease club funding by 20 percent.

I believe one of the problems wilh funding i 
how il is approached. It is a long, complicated

it for you, bring it back and give it to you . I feel 
we should allow clubs a little more autonomy in 
that regard. We should allow them to go purchase 
it and lurn in a receipl, and Ihen reimburse them. 
That would be a far simpler process than if they 
had to make an appointment 10 have a person go 
with them and purchase il. Otherwise iL is too 
many trips back and fonh . San Diego is a very 
spread-out place and finding stuff is hard .. The

I think that there might be a misconception 
about the significance of system-wide issues. 
From my experience, I see the importance of sys-

Wilson stopped buying out fees and fees actually 
did increase? Or what if we could get a fee stand-
still or maybe even a fee roll-back? It may be 
easy to say Ihal system-wide issues don' t affect 
us, but we have to look where the power lies. The 
UC Office of President has control of a lot of 
things . We have 10 realize that fact if we want 10

local, I don'l mean only UCSD. but I mean the 
community. I don ' t think that we have done that 
very well. I think that we' ve created slrong links 
wilh the community outside of La Jolla, but I 
Ihink we can build resources and gain communi-
Iy support Ihrough community-wide events . I 
don ' t think thaI we can have a plan unless we do 
it holisti cally. Looking at UCSD holistically, we 
have a broader dimension of what can be accom-
plished on this campus. 

I think we also have to change our perspec-
tive. I don 't think that my role as A.S. Presidenl 
is doomed to failure because it is all done in one 
year. I think what needs to be done is that we 
need to build some son of accountability in a 
shon-Ienn way, trying to get students to feel that 
they can approach their student leaders. That 
might mean more programming. That might 
mean join! programming. That might mean try-
ing to find other resources outside to give us 
more funding. That definitely doesn 't mean that 
we ' re going to give more funding to student 
organizations by cuning something else. It means 
being more pro-active. I want to look into long-
term planning rather than always trying to find 
radical solutions 10 our problems. We need to be 
at the point where we evaluate what the students 
feel about, say, the Sun God, or about how stu-
dents feel about TGs or movies. 

I think what's been lacking from the A.S. is 
the level of commitment of cO\lllCil members to 
outreach and publicity. Publicity actually has 
ve ry scarce resources. I think that we should 
work on that . II's not just about what students 
feel about the A.S. or trying to lIet them to be a 
part of the A.S.; it's about uyinllo get students 
to feel that they can come to the A.S. with their 
problems. The only way that's l!Oing to happen is 
if the A.S. stans to do some active outreach. I 
think that the A.S. needs to do more active out-
reach and make that a commitment It 's nothing 
where we can say that we just are loing to do a 
campus-wide survey via e-mail. Some people are 
going 10 criticize this thing saying that it's very 
idealistic and not the best way to go, but I think 
that ii's the best way to stan. I'm looking at this 
in the sense that we need to stan this spring quar-. 
ter. People need to know and undcntand who we 
are . I think that the A.S. isn 't radlin, out to pe0-
ple because of a lack of com~llion. We have 
thousands of students out there who really don't

Soule, Dialla 
"The students want results, they do not want talk or rhetoric. I feel that if the students want a change in their A.S., if they 
want a revolution, then they should vote for people in the R volution slate." 
Why are you running under 
the Revolution alate and 
what are you main goals? 

Bas ica ll y, our whole philosophy 
is "Real issues, rea l solutions." In 
the past couple years we've fe lt 
that the A.S. has gotten very out of 
touch with the needs of the average 
student. In tead of being eternall y 
political and ideological we want to 
tum io the student 's com.:e rm,. Most 
students feel that UCS D is a ocial-
Iy and cult ura lly , tilling place to 
hc. They feci that the campu~ life 
and undergraduatc education they

I'd also like to rcconsiuer 
Wi nterFcst, which has heen hilled 
as a ,econd Sun God. Winter qu ar-
ter is Iypically a bori ng quaner, and 
students want exciting program-
ming like the Sun God to be con-
linued throughout the year. 

We also have very lillie control 
over our enterpri ses (Lec ture 
Notes, Soft Reserves). I'd like to 
centrali ze thc control a littl e bit 
more and look at proposal like 
accepting credit cards at Sort 
Reserves and Lecture Notes and 
offering audio tapes at Lecture 
Notes. Also we need new enterpris-
es in the Price Center and the Old 

Student Center, like a ideo tore 
and dry cleaning. I'd rea ll y like to 
look at the prospeci of pUlling an 
enterpri se in one of those space, 
that arc opening up. 
How do you propose to 
increase funding to Improve 
student life on campus? 

I think there's room to increasc 
fund ing for programming. 
Programming is one of the mosl 
Il11 pOnanl things 10 Ihe average SIU-
dent , and I fee l that we as A .. ofli -
eers should ask oursc!lc~ what we 
have to do Ito increa~e program-

need to find alternative fundi ng

One thing we looked mil) when 
I wa, on A.S. was gctting profi ts 
throug h the bookstore. Thi~ i, n' t 
completely feasihlc yet, but we 
might di scuss getting a 2 percent 
allocation that would go 10 studcnt 
organilations and not directly to 
the A.S. I'd likc to ccntralil.c our 
co-ops and service more and make 
them more profitable so that we 
could rely on that income more 
than just as a back-up source. 
Obviously the fee increase we've 
proposed in the past have failed 
because student don 't want to pay 
any more fees . They obviously 
don't want us to cut services, so 

what Ih l.:y' re say ing is "' Find sOl11e-
thing elsc, Af). Try to do some-
thing else." 
What are your priorities for 
funding allocation? 

I hold , tudenl orga ni7ations to 
be the biggest priurity in the budget 
simply because they ' re really Ihe 
bigge ·t sources of unit y and con-
nection that the siudents ha ve. lI 's 
vilal Ihat we he able to provide 
funding fo r ~Iutle nt organi/ations. 
If you rea ll y look at it , although the 
, lUdent organi/utions hudget ha~

(I f stuue nt orgarlila tinn, has

there\ beell a Inl of lalk about Ihe 
Committee fo r World Democrat:y 
( WD) being th l: onl y , tudent 
organilati on funded in the execu-
ti ve budget. As a student organila-
tion, I value their contribution to 
the campus. but why shouldn ' t 
CWD have to fi ghl for the rest of 
the pie with every other student 
organization? 
Do you think that the main 
focus should be .ystemwIH 
and Include such thine- as 
Iobbylnc or should it be

I Ihink campus issues uefinit cly

cause of the increasing competit iveness of 
UCSD uthletics, many Division HI schools 
are reluctant to schedule contests with UCSD.

percent have enrollments of less than 2,500. 
Other Division III independent schools in-
clude Keyoka College, Cazonovia College 
and Agnes SCOll College. 

"Division n provides an opportunity for a 
conference affiliation," Sports Information Di-
rcetorBiII Gannon said. ''111e movecan be made 
without the addition of scholarships, as evi-
denced by UC Davis' sueee s in Division n 
athletics. Davi does not give out full rides, but 
it won the Sears Cup last year as the best overall 
Di vision n athletic program in the country." 

BRUIN BLOWOUT: Hosting defending National Champ 
UCLA, the Tritons struggled offensively and lost 10-2 

"We don' t fit in the Division III group," 
Associate Athletic Director Ken Grosse said. 
"A move to Di vision II would give us more 
nex ihility in scheduling and a beller chance to 
compete with like schools." 

By Jonah Nisenson 
Staff Writer 

It was a match-up that featured the No. 
I ranked women's waler polo team in the 
nation, UCLA, versus a younger. inexpe-

rienced UCSD team. The de-
fending National Champion 
Bruin team dominated in the 
water. The UCSD group 
battled defensi ve ly, but sti II 
lost, 10-2. Al th ough Triton 
goa lie Maryam Hadiashar 
was a blocking mac hine 
throughout , UCLA had too 

much firepower. 
Continuing to strugg le wi th six-on-fi ve 

opportunities, UCSD could not score in 
the first half. Before the Maryland game 
last Saturday, the Tritons were a di mal 12 
percent at converting six-on-five advan-
tages. They continued to struggle with 
that aspect of their game on Saturday. 
UCSD also faced a talented Bruin goa lie, 
who did her part in only allowing two 
goals all day. 

"We've been getting the calls," senior 
Shawna Caballero said. "Our problem is 
pUlling the ball in the cage. We' ve been 
struggling with that lately." 

Before Jenny Irwin was able to put one 
in the goal for UCSD, UCLA had jumped 
to a 7-0. Irwin scored both goals for the 
San Diego squad in the third quarter, but 
UCLA's defense would not allow any-
thing else. 

Defensively, UCSD put pressure on 
the Bruins. The team gave up a few goals 
carlyon, before realizing they would have 
to playa tremendously tough defense just 
to stay in the game. 

In lhe fourth quarter, the Tritons re-

sponded to the chall enge and did not allow 
another goal. Unfortunately, it was too 
late. For the season, UC 0 fell to 2- 1 I, 
while UCLA improved to 17- 1 in its quest 
to earn another National Championship. 

"In term of defcnse, there were times 
when they (UCLA) didn ' t get any shots 
off," Jenny Ness sa id . "We played much 
bett er defen i ve ly lhan the score implied." 

The Tritons have lost more than they 
ha ve won this season. While improvement 
is noti ceable in every game, severa l little 
things still need att ention. 

" I thought all in all we didn ' t play 
badly:' Triton Head Coach Denny Harper 
said. "We are making strides of improve-
ment but because we arc so youn g, there 
are a lot of fundamentals we have to work 
hard at." 

Improving at a rapid rate, Hadiashar 
has proven her elf at the goa lie posi tion. 
She conditioned hard over the break, and 
is no longer having trouble getting the ball 
down the length of the pool. Becoming 
accustomed 10 the league in her freshman 
season, both her confidence in the cage 
and her number of blocks arc growi ng at a 
rapid pace. 

"Maryam is the most improved player 
right now," Harper said. "She is stroki ng 
the ball up the court, sometimes gelling it 
within four meters so that we only need 
maybe two passes to get the ball into two 
meters." 

UCSD next faces No. 4 ranked San 
Diego State on April 16 at Canyonview 
Pool. The cross-town rivals will provide 
the Tritons with an opportunity to show 
their ability to beat a quality Division I 
squad and improve their chances for the 
postseason.

Michat!1 Bedar took the rHound for the night -
cap. 

This game would prove to be a battle as 
well. Cal Lutheran scored once in the first and 
agai n in the founh, but UC 0 responded with 
two runs of their own in the bOllom of the 
founh . David Takehara took overt he pitching 
duties for Bedar in the last of the fourth, and 
shut the Kingsmen down until the seventh, 
when they scored two more to take the lead 4-
2. 

The UCSD hillers created many scoring 
opponunities throughout the game, including 
a leadoff triple from Jon Goldsmith and a 
leadoff double by George Escanuelas, but 
they couldn ' t capitalize, stranding them both. 
In total , the Tritons stranded eight runners. 
But in the bollom half of the seventh , UCSD 
broke through and cut the Cal Lutheran lead 
down to one, 4-3. 

In the eighth, however, the Kingsmen 
showed why they are one of the most power-
fulteams in the country, scoring a combined 
five runs off Eddie Ishak and John Willis, 
indudingback-to-back homers. It was acrush-
ing blow to the Tritons; coming back would 
be an awesome challenge. 

But again , the Tritons were up to the 

Students need to understand the fac ts be-
hind a proposed move to Division n athletics, 
knowing that is in the best interests of student 
life at UCSD. 

task. They threatened in their half of the 
eighth, but couldn ' t score. In the ninth , they 
put together a big rally, scoring three runs 
and clos ing the gap to 9-6. But that would 
he as close as they would get. Cal Lut heran 
finally stopped Ihe bleeding and escaped 
the day with a split. 

Despite the loss, both of these games 
were ex tremely important to the Tritons. 
Not only is Cal Lutheran one of thei r big-
gesl ri vals. but playing against them served 
as a measuring st ick to see just how UCSD 
would perform under immense pressure. 
The answer: great. The Tritons are feeling 
very confident now, which is somelhing 
defeating the third-ranked team in the coun-
try can do for a team . 

"We had a really good day all the way 
around," Fletcher said. "We had one really 
bad inning . ICal Lutheran\ is a very good 
hitting club, probably one of the better ones 
we'll face all year. But on our better days we 
can play with anybody." 

The rest of the Tritons share their 
skipper's confidence. They seem ready to 
break free of the incon istency that has 
plagued them all season long. UCSD is 
looking to make a late-season run, and they 
have some important Divi sion 1II matchups 
ahead. They sent a message to the resl of 
their opponent with their performance last 
Saturday: Look out, the Cardiac Kids are 
coming on strong.

Pennsylvannia Blues Tritons Host Classic 
TOUGH ROAD: At the fir t-ever Division III National Cham-
pionship, No, I ranked UCSD was the prime target 

APRIL SHOWERS: Intermittent rainfall was not enough to 
spoil the Softball Clas ie, with host UCSD going 3-3 

By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

For the U SO men' s volleyba ll team, the 
trip to the fiN-ever Divi ion III ational 
Championships in Pennsy lvannia began wi th 
high hopes and ended wi th ultimate 
di~appointmenl. Throughout much 
of the year, the Tritons have "per-
ated as "giant-k illers", taking down 
higher-ranked opponent~ by excel-
hng 111 the role of the underdog. 
Unfortunately for UCSD Head 
Coach Duncan McF<lrland and hi ~ 
team, the Triton, en tered the inau-
gural (()urnament as the o. I ~ecd and the 
main targrt or an upset-minded ~I.fuad from 
Springfie ld College. A major ro le rcver~al 
had the three Ea~t OU\t <'qua(!\ all gunning 
alter their We\t oa\t rival. 

"The other teams were totally gunnll1g for 
us." McParl and ~aid. "jThe three Eastern 
team\j were all prelly ~o lid . om lllg back 
with a hig reputation, the other team~ really 
saw a chance to further the ca w,e of Ea~t 
against West by knocking us off. " 

As one of four teams parti ci pating 111 the.: 
tournament . tbe Tri ton~ went head 10 he;td 
agaimt Springfie ld in a semifinal match to 
determ ine which team wou ld go on to the 
Championship Final. Throughout the year. 
the majority of the wins by U SD have seen 
the Tri tons rail behind early before rallying 
back by uSing thei r excellen t sideout (tbi Ii ty to 
wi n the match. 

Opening the match agai nst Springfield. 
U SD found itse lf in the ex tremely unusual 
situati on of being both higher ranked and 
holding an ellrly lead in the match. 

The Triton~ opened game one playing the 
type of vo lleyballthm had garnered them the 
No. I ranking in Division III. As has neen tbe 
case throughout the year. the UC D offense 
looked to its " bi g three" of Eric Mai, Jon 
Yarris and Matt M i nehan to anchor the allal:k . 
The Tritons were able to capitalize on 13 

Springfield errors and capture the momentum 
to start the match. With the o ffen~e finding its 
groove, UCSD opened its stay on the East 
Coast with a 15- 12 win in game one. 

With one game fini ~hed , both teams sett led 
in for a long match. As nerves 
began to ea lm on both Sides, the 
Springfield olfen~c started to warm 
up and become more difficult for 
UCSD to handle.

Rain usually signals the end of softball

through intermillent April showers

to hmtthi~ weekend' ~ Powerbar Soft-

Rod Carew, and took the game, 7-1. 
"Chapman is a great hilling tea m. They 

arc one of the top three team in Division III 
in the country, " UCSD Head Coach Patricia 
Gerckens said. " We played a great game; at 

the end they started hitting." 

Game two ~aw the momentum

The women brought a 17-7 record 
and a winning attitude to the compe-

Despi te a couple of losses, the 
women moved on to quarterfinal play 
on Saturday. The opponent was again

"We were extremely biller to get 
the los~ (in the first game). so it felt 
even beller to beat them in the second "Right from the start, we kind of \trogg led and made error\ In all pha\es of the

The Pride had a "big Ihrec" of their own to 
rival thc Triton,> and all three put together 
strong showi ng~. Hilla Peter MumlY led the 
way for Springfield with 34 kill, while his 
teammates Darren Smlthur~t and Rohert 
Mosca added 29 and 19. respcctlvely . 

A~ the Pride offen~e began 10 come alive, 
the two teams fou nd points difficult to come 
by. ei ther team seemed ab le to take con trol 
of the second game. A~ the squads traded 
points, it becamc clear that ranking, wou ld 
mean nothing in determining the winner of 
the match. 

While the Tritons had been experts at pull -
ing out c lose games previou,ly, they found 
thi s gift lacking against Springfield and 
dropped the second game, 15- 13. 

As difficult as the ~e..:ond game had heen 
for UCSD.the third proved to be even tougher 
with the outcome being decided by just a few 
points. In similar fashion to the previous game, 
poin ts were difficult to come by and nei ther 
team grahbed decisive control of the game.

a 1-1 record . 

The first game Thur~day evening p,Ued the

ting ~ix error~ and allowing 10 hits bel' re 
finally ~uccumhing 7-3. 

In a..:tion later that night , the women 's 
squad played Cal Bapti st College. It was a 
battle of stingy hurlers, as no pitcher al -
lowed an earned run . However, the Tritons 
made four errors to give the Lancers two 
run .. Two run, wa, all Cal Bapti st needed, 
a\ they used two ritchers and allowed only 
one run in the ~eventh inning. Cal Bapti st 
won 2- 1. • 

In Friday's action. the women faced both 
Claremont and Chapman. Claremont was 
easily beaten, 4-2. but Chapman was an-
other story . 

The Panthers, the eventual tournament 
champion ,werepumll1eling opponents with 
a stacked batting lineup. They pounded out 
runs ap lenty behind the bat of Stephanie 
Carcw, daughter of baseball Hall of Famer 

game." pitcher Eri n Flanigan said. ''We 
were sure we wcre the beller team." 

Indeed, this proved to be the case. The 
women performed so lidly at home, Winning 
5-1. 

"I think we played up to our potential." 
Flanigan said. "There was a lot of tough 
compcti tion at the tournament." 

In the semifinal s, the Lady Tritons ballied 
Alusa Pacific. Ranked fourth in NAIA, the 
~ucceSl>fu l Cougars were fresh off a bye and 
ready to rumble. Despite laterallies, the women 
were never able to get close and lost 11 -7. 

" Winning isn't everything," mu sed 
centerfielder Cynth ia Sam. " We played 
really well as a team." 

Coach Gerckens echocd those senti ments. 
" It was really a team effort. We don 't 

have individual stars; the whole team was 
one big star. Ot only did they play hard, but 
they played wit h heart," Gerckens said. 

The women wi ll tra vel to Costa Mesa to 
battle Southern Ca liforni a College on 
Wedne day. Over the weekend, the team 
wi II playa rematch against Chapman. The 
young Tritons arc trying to a sert them-

A 20- 1 0 record gi ves UCSD its mo t wins in

CSD, I have noted that the o. 
I complaint of !>lUdent ~ i~ the 
lack of !>chool spi rit that plagues 
our campus. 

Wel1, I have the answer to al1 
of our prohlems, and it doesn' t 
require any sort of serious effort 
on the part of the hardworking 

~tudenl. The only thing that you 
have to do i\ go to the pol1s 
during the A.S. electIOns this 
week and vote in ~upport of the 
move of our athletic department 
from Division 1II to Division II. 

I'm sure that many of you 
believe that a change of division 
would mean an Increase in 
student fees. The beauty of thi s 
ballot question IS that there is no 
increase of fees attached. Rather, 
the university admi ni tration has 
said it will support the financial 
aspects of the move without 
pas ing on the costs to students. 

It i also important to note 
that the queMion on the ballot 
concerning intercollegiate 
athletics has not hing to do with 
the fee referendum presented by 
club sports. The two are 
completely separate, just as club 
sports and intercollegiate 
athletics are unrelated. 

Let me explain why it i 
important that we, as an 
institution. take this step.

CARDIAC KIDS: 
U sing late heroics, the 
Triton came back to 
earn a draw with third-
ranked Cal Lutheran 
By Travis Hili 
Co-ASSOCiate Sports Editor 

It has been an emotional, up-
and-down season for the I 1- 12 
U SD baseball team. There ha ve 
been huge wins and tough 10S6es, 
and almost every game has been 
dec ided in late innings - if not in 
ex tra frames. This group definitely 

warrant~ the ni ckname Card iac Kids. 
The Kids were at it again last 

weekend agamst heated ri va l al 
Lutheran, the top Di vision III team 
in the West, and the o. 3 ranked 
Division III team in the country. But 
after a IO-inning warinGame I that 
the Tritons pulled out 6-5, and a 
gUll y 9-6 loss in the nightcap, Hcad 
Coach Robert Fletcher's men seem 
poised for a late-season run . 

Fletcher' troops, while obvi-
ously talented, were the underdogs 
on Saturday. But from the opening

Kingsmen knew they were in for a 
struggle. Rondestvedt, who has been

stuff. He kept the Tri tons in the 
game whi le the offense began to 
heat up. 

CS D got on the board in 
the fourth . tyi ng the game at 
one. Then in the fifth , the Tri -
tons added three more with 
th e help of so me cos tl y 
Kingsmen errors. The UC D 
allack, which has been cor-
ing quite frequently in recent 
games. continued to be led by 
jun iorshorlstop Mark Mason, 
who had three hits and two RBis in 
the game (he would end up going 6-
9 on the day with four RBis). Fresh-
man catcher Joseph Alioto chimed 
in with two hits and an RBI , and 
Ryan Hill also had an RBI. 

Rondestvedt had a 4-1 lead go-

ing into the top of the sixth. but the 
dangerous Cal Lutheran hitters fi-
nally got hi number and produced 

three runs to ti e the game. 
Fletcher tried to stop the 
King men rally by inserting 
Theo Robins, who is nor-
mally a starter. Robi ns re-
sponded t9 the pre sure, and 
shut the Kingsmen down 
through the ninth. But the 
Tritons bats were si Ie need 
through nine as well , sending 

the game into extra innings. 
In the I Dth frame, Cal Lutheran 

finally got to Robins and scored a 
run . But the Cardiac Kids had been 
in thi s situation before. They had no 
intention of rolling over. They put 
together a rally and scored a run . 

But the Tritons were not sati fied ; 
they continued to rally, loading the 
bases fo r the center fielder, David 
Myers. 

The beautiful thing about base-
ba ll is that there i never a sure 
thing. It is impossible to give up on 
even the simple t of plays becau e 
anything can happen . And it did . 
Myers lifted a lazy ny ball to right, 
a sure oul. But the sun was shining, 
fan and players were screaming 
and sure enough the ball dropped 
right into the open glove of the right 
fielder, and fell right out. Tritons 6, 
Kingsmen 5. That's why they play
