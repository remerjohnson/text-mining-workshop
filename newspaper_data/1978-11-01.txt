Day Care Board Holds 
First Day of Hearings 

By Eric HarpelJ 
Staff Wrtler 

Members of the UCSD Day 
Care Center staff spoke on the 
procedures and goals of the 
Day Care Center during yes-
terday 's open session of the Reg 
Fee Committee's Day Care 
Information Board. 

Speaking first, Day Care 
Center stafC member Kathleen 
Ruda discussed the basic 
philosophy of child care and the 
ways in which the staff carried ' 
out the philosophy. 

The next speaker, Barbara 
Clark, talked about the funding 
the center receives from the 

State Department of Education 
(SDE) and how it affects the 
operation of the center. SDE 
funds are a form of " tuition 
paid to the center for every 
parent," said Clark, adding 
that SDE only provides funds 
for specific types of educational 
programs. The center-receives 
these funds, she said, because1t · 
provides instruction for the 
children as well as babysitting 
services. Clark told the In-
formation Board that cuts in 
the educational programs 
would result in losses in state 
funding. 

The Day Care Information 

Libertarian Clark 
Espouses Views 

By Donald LaWlOa 
Calling the Libertarian 

position a more radical ap-
proach to individual rights than 
that presented by either major 
party. Ed Clark, the Liber-
tarian party candidate for 
governor, dilCU8led his pro-
posal. concerning education, 
crime and taxes before a UCSD 
audience yesterday afternoon. 

Clark proposed abolishing 
mandatory public school at-
tendance and instituting a 
tuition tax credit program in 
which parents could deduct 
$800 from their tax bill to pay 
for tuition at alternative 
schools. " California public 
schools are an absolute disas-
ter," he said. "Parents should 
be allowed to select schools that 
meet the needs of their child-

reno We must bring alternative 
education within the reach of 
every family." 

To combat crime, Clark 
advocated redirectiq govern-
ment resources toward stop-
ping violent crime with less 
concentration by police on 
victimless crimes such as drug-
use and prostitution. " Govern-
ment should be involved in 
stopping the violation of rights, 
which means stopping violence 
or fraud committed against a 
person's body or property," he 
said. 

On the subject of taxation, 
Clark advocated "tax cuts that 
give relief to people who didn't 
get releif from Proposition 13." 
He proposed the phasing out of 
the state sales tax and a $500

Board was set up by the Reg 
Fee Committee last spring to 
provide a Day Care informa-
tion source for both the com-
mittee and the students. It will 
report to the Reg Fee Com-
mittee when the committee 
decides if they will continue the 

Fee funding of the center. 

The Information Board will 
meet again tomorrow from 4 to 
7 pm in the Revelle Informall 
Formal Lounge. Kenzie Nicoll, 
Reg Fee Committee chair, will 
appear along with Rick White-
hill, who is currently director of 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services. Whitehill used to be 
Assistant to the Vice- Chan-
cellor of Student Affa irs and co-
chair 01 the Reg Fee Com-
mittee, which has partially 
funded the Day Care Center in 
the past. 

Both Clark and Ruda , in 
response to a question from the 
Information Board, said that 
lower pay rates at the center 
would result in a higher 
turnover rate of personnel'. " It 
is essential," said Ruda, " that 
children become familiar with 
the staff." Both Ruda and Clark 
maintained from their ex-
perience with private day care 
centers that lower wages would 
result in personnel remaining 
less than one year on the 
average. 

Clark also spoke of the 
possibility of a joint day care 
program involving both the 
UCSD Day Care Center and the 
day care facility at the UCSD 
International Center . 

Third Task Force Created 
In an effort to re-evaluate and 

determine the future naming of 
Third College, a Task Force 
within the Tbird College 
Council has been created. 

According to Sung Choe, a 
student Task Force member, 

the goal of the group will be " to 
investigate further into the 
naming of Third College and to 
provide a set of recommenda-
tions to the Counci l." The 
recommendations, he added, 
"ill not be presented to the 

Council until the first week of 
winter quarter because " there 
is much to look into." 

The creation of the Task 
Force stems from Chancellor 
McElroy's decision last sum-
mer, based upon recommenda-
tions from the Naming Com-
mittee, to suspend permanent 
naming of Third College in-
definitely . His decision has 
been a source of controversy 
for both Third College and the 
University as a whole. 

Beverly Varga, Third College 
Dean, says that she anticipates 
" much debating and display of 
opinions." The Council, she 
perceives , " will be ve ry 
dependent upon the commit-
tee ' s r ecommendation s ." 
Varga emphasizes that com-
mittee di scussions will not 
involve just the name "Third," 
but will remain a objective 
and open as possible. 

The Task Force will meet at 
least once per week throughout 
fall quarter . A proposal to allow 
the public to attend se ions 
will be mad at the commit-
tee' fir t meeting. "Should th 
committee d cide to m intain 
clo cd e ions," Varga noted,

I&J}ers to the Editor 

Rlew Berated: 
Out of 'Politics! 
Editor: 

Common sense is not com-
mon and it is therefore not 
surprisiq that at your age/ 
status you baven't any. First of 
all I wondered if you were 
quoted correctly in the UCSD 
Gaanliaa of 10/20178, and if so, 
then you should be held respon-
sible for its contents/ con-
sequences. 

It beats me how in less than 
three months of your arrival for 
a limited teaching job or 
assignment , you could get 
involved in domestic (internal) 
politics of which nobody wants 
your opinion . To worsen the 
situation, you choose a con-
troversial topic that involves a 
lot of politics that only the 
Americans can dare challenge. 
If you don't know. ask the U.S. 
Supreme Court but not the 
British Parliament or House of 
Commons. If you were that 
good a domestic diplomat! 
politician, you should have by 

and gODe from UCSD without 
tampering with the domestic 
issues here and you sbould not 
be an exception juat as you 
believe that "aD appointing 
bodies should be color blind. " If 
you want to make a head-way In 
U.S. politics, the place to start 
your campaign is in New 
Hampshire and in 1910 too! 

And by the way, where were 
you wben your dear fore-
fa tbers went to Africa to 
enslave unarmed, free Af-
ricans? The encroacbment and 
forced acquisition of territories 
in Africa initiated by your 
forefathers (slave dealers) is 
still killing many people today 
in South Africa , Namibia , 
Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) . There 
is more to be learned about 
philosophy at UCSD and I'm 
sure the students will ap-
preciate your contributions to 
this goal rather than your 
Johnny Just Come (JJC) 
politics. And please don't soil or 
damn the reputation of Oxford, 
alright?

Assaults in 'Bridegroom' 
Not Justifiable or Funny 
Editor: 

Like Jill Louise Bazeley, I 
recently attended a perfor-
maace of TIle RtbIter Bride-
......... However, after reading 
ber review (Guardlaa, Oct. 23) , 
I wondered if we bad indeed 
seen the same show. What most 
impressed ber was "the c0un-
try-western/bluegrass spirit of 
the musical". There Is another 
theme In this play whicb is not 
in the least light or comical and 
whicb I found most distressing. 
This show , in my opinion, 
perpetuates the false notion 
that women not only enjoy but 
also seek out violent sexual 
encounters. As a female and as 
a rape victim, I am convinced 
that there is very little about 
rape which is amusing and, 

furthermore, that tbose wbo 
believe this myth are quite 
mistaken. 

An alternative analysis of the 
play sbows that the theme of tbe 
willing woman rape victim 
comes to Iigbt three times in the 
lint act. (I regret that I cannot 
report on the second) . The first 
lastance is when Rosamund 
!'tIus,rove encounters Jamie 
Lockhart, the "Bandit of the 
Woods". As he walks away with 
all her clothes, she · asks him, 
"Is tbat all you're going to take 
from me?" Later, despite the 
theft of her new drellll, Rosa-
mund returns to look for the 
robber . Jamie wanders 
through the dark forest and she 
follows him blindly, Finally he 
takes her in his arms and, 

according to another charac-
ter, "be took from her the only 
thing he'd left her the day 
before." In the third incident 
Rosamund finds Jamie's bouse 
and waits there, apparently 
hopin, to seduce bim . He 
succumbs, but only on his own 
terms. He gives her a quick 
rigbt jab to the jaw. Then 
having rendered Rosamund 
unconscious, Jamie proclaims 
the delights of illicit love in a 
song, "Love Stolen". 

now settled the warinNorthern , ,-----------------------------------, 

According to Ms. Bazeley, 
Jamie is justified in knocking 
out his lover so that he may 
"enjoy himself to the full" , 
althougb "there isn' t much in it 
for Rosamund". Ms. Bazeley Is 
correct in the second part of her 
analysis, but not in tbe first. 
Frankly, the implicit com-
parison between taking cookies 
from a cookie jar and baving 
sexuaj relations with an inert 
body is both ludicrous and 
offensive to me, and it is not in 
tbe least justiCiable. 

Ireland but instead, Mr. Flew, 
you just flew from Heathrow 
Airport (London) to Lindbergh 
Field (San Diego) to open your 
mouth full of BULLSHIT. 

I really don't care about you r 
one-man opinion, but I do ca re 
about the e mbarrassing words 
you've chosen in your so-called 
interview with Alison Hall . I 
beg your pardon?! Whom we re 
you referri ng to as " poor 
devil... .. a nd how ca n you prove 
that "a lot of black youngsters 
are ve r y d isi ncli ne d to 
study ..... ? How long have you 
been involved in black edu-
cation in the U.S.A. to assert 
that statement publicly? Are 
yo u tryi ng t o m a ke your 
presence felt at UCSD? For 
your information, many great 
visiting professors have come

Free Column 
We are once again instituting 

the Free Column. Itisavailable 
to any person or group who has 
something to say about a ' 
current issue. Government, the 
lack of government, the elec-
tions, the University, social 
reality, whatever you want to 
speak your mind on, we will 
print in the Free Column. Bring 
submissions to our offices in the 
Student Center; type them 
double-spaced on a 72-space 
line. 

In the three occasions I bave 
pointed out, Rosamund is 
portrayed as actively pro-
voking Jamie. She is " asking 
for it" and indeed she "gets it", 
namely a violent sexual en-
counter. The Robber Bride-
groom adds credence to the 
myth that women " want" to be 
raped. 

This theme is abhorrent. I 
was shocked to see a subject as 
serious as rape be treated so 
ligbtly, especially at a time 
when women have worked 
diligently to call this issue to the 
public's attention and in a 
newspaper on a campus where 
the Women's Rape Task Force 
has organized activities to 
make students more sensitive 
to t.his issue . I fi lld this 
depiction of a woman who 
actively seeks to be abused 
violently and sexually ex-
tremely offensive. Rather than 
"Steal Over to See the 'Rob-
ber' '', Isuggest we "Report tile 
Robber-Rapist" and boycott 
this play, and any other Old 
Globe productions which offend 
the female audience.

Visit Augurs T 'reaty 
.fA\fiil 
L.;JJ' lIIill\YJ@IiilID~[i' ~p ~IDilf3 JERUSALEM (,4P) - Prime Minister Menachem Begin leaves today on a trip to the 

United States and Canada amid 
hopes for an early signing ofthe 
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 
But some Israeli officia ls 
grumbled tha t Washington was 
obstructing progress on the 
pact. 

Washington peace talks a nd it 
was possible that the treaty 
would be signed quickly. 

" President Carter, President 
Sadat and I may sign a peace 
treaty on the day before we 
(Sadat and Begin) receive the 
prize in Os lo," Begin said . 
" That would entitle us to the 
dollars and the title," he said, 
smiling. 
~@W~ ffiU'D@il@ He said Dec. 9, the day before the a ward of Nobel. has been mentioned as a date. "If the treaty will be ready by then, I 

think this will be the best day," 
he said. 

Opposition , to 5 
Set Dollar Mark 

Begin is to receive an award 
from the New York Council of 
Churches and go on to Canada 
for an official visit Nov. 6. 
Besides addressing the United 
Jewish ApPeal group in Los 
Angeles, the prime minister 
a lso will meet Israel's nego-
tiating team to the Washington 
peace ta lks. 

"From my conversations 
today with Washington, I can 
say there is a possibility that a 
peace treaty between Israel 
and Egypt will be signed soon," 
the prime minister said. 

" I am very cautious and I 
wish to be explicit," Begin said . 
"There is no guarantee, and I 
cannot promise a date. But 
there is a chance." 

Meanwhile, Israeli officials 
here are showing growing 
irritation and resentment over 
the U.S. position in the talks, 
which they described as more 
pro-Arab than Egypt's stand. 

" We a re rea lly puzzled by 
what' s going on . The Egyptians 
seem willing to go farther than 
the Americans are willing to let 
them," said one official, who 
refused to be identified. 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - To-
bacco companies have spent 
about $4.5 million in a record-
setting bid to crush a November 
ballot measure that would ban 
or restrict smoking in some 
buildings. 

As of Oct. 23, opponents of the 
anti-smoking measure, Pro-
position 5, bad raised $4.58 
million and spent just over $4.6 
million, with almost all of the 
money coming from tobacco 
companies. 

In contrast, the Yes-On-S 
Committee bad raised just over 
$509,000, including $82,761 in 
loans. 

The record for spending by 
one side in a proposition 
campaign was $4 .03 million, set 
in 1976 by opponents of the 
Nuclear Safeguards Initiative. 
That measure lost by more than 
2-1. Spending by both sides in 
that 1976 campaign also set a 
record: $5.29 million. 

Virtually all of the No-On-5 
money is coming from four 
tobacco companies: the Brown 
and Williamson Tobacco Co. 
($170,000) , Lorillard ($584,545) , 
Philip Morris , Inc . ($1.38 
million) and the R.J . Reynolds 
Tobacco Co. ($1.67 million) . 

And a good sha re of the sm a ll 
contributions taken in by the 
No-On-5 Committe, Ca lifor-
nians for Common Sense, have 
come from tobacco company 
employees. 

The companies fear approval 
of the California measure could 
spark similar movements in 
other states, and cut into their 
sales. 

Proposition 5, with some 
exceptions, would ban smoking 
in work places, educational and 
health facilities, museums, 
theaters , auditoriums, busi-
ness establishments, public 
transportation facilities , ele-
vators and public restrooms.

Dow Jones 

NEW YORK (AP) - The 
Dow Jones industrial average 
skidded below the lOCI level to its 
lowest close in nearly six 
months Tuesday as the stock 
market resumed its severe 
late-October slide. 

Heavy losses throughout the

forced selling of stock bought 
on credit, as well as relentless 
upward pressure on interest 
rates . 

The Dow Jones average of 30 
industrials fell 19.40 points to 
792.45, its lowest close since it 
finished at 715.21 last April 13. 

In the last half of October the

Checking 
Transfers 
Okayed 

WASHI NGTON (AP) - Be-
ginning today , banks across the 
country can offer a new service 
which permits automatic 
transfer of funds from their 
customers ' savings to checking 
accounts. 

U.S. District Judge Oliver 
Gasch denied on Tuesday an 
attempt by the U.S. League of 
Savings Associations to block 
the new regulations which were 
issued by the Federal Reserve 
Board and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. effective Nov. 
1. 

In a statement from Dallas, 
the league said it would appea l. 
League general counsel Wil-
liam Prather said, " We feel 

- that Judge Oliver Gasch was 
wrong in his decision ." 

Also in Dallas for the 
league's convention, Robert H. 
McKinney, chairman of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board, called a board meeting 
for Wednesday to consider the 
new regulations. He said 
Gasch's decision points to the 
need for immed iate action by 
t he boa rd , wh ich regulates 
savings a nd loa n associations. 

Un der the new rule , an 
i nd ivi d ual depositor at a 
federa lly insured bank may 
e nter into a written agreement 
with the bank to arrange for the 
a utomatic withdrawal of funds 
from his savings account and 
the transfer of the funds to a 
checking account.

Thou,h water polo coach 
Russ Hafferkamp complained 
of his ~'s anonymity in the 
Bay Area, the Tritons left an 
impression on several of the 
teams they faced this weekend. 
PlayiDl seven ,ames within a 
48-hour span, the squad col-
lected tbree wins and four 
losses, a statistic that doesn't 
begin to describe the ex-
perience the youn, team 
gained. 

"Our record could have been 
five wins .and two losses, but 
this whirlwind tour really took 
its toll," said Halferkamp. "We 
learned a lot. It was worth the 
trip." 

The trip fint took them to San 
Jose to match skills a,ainst San 
Jose State on Friday. UCSD 
tied the score 5-5 at halftime, 

but got drowned by eighlgoals 
the next period to lose 13-6. 

Only two Tritons were eject· 
ed dUrin, the game, but the low 
number of kickouts may have 
done the team more harm than 
good. "The defense was let tin, 
down to protect themselves 
from ,ettlnl kicked out. They 
allowed more natural ,oals 
that way ," said the UCSD 
coach. 

The next morning Kai Loedel 
put in three ,oals, and Jim 
Bain, Toby Raymond, Jor,en-
sen and Elliott all scored, but 
the Tritons couldn't top the ten 
goals or the University of Santa 
Clara. 

Trailing 4-1 after two quar-
ters, UCSD matched Santa 
Clara goal lor ,oal in the next 
half and lost 10-7. 

Without even a rest between 
games, the tired Tritons took on 
San Francisco State in the 

UCSD's men's soccer team los' in an afternoon game against 
Azusa Pacific, 3-1. Coach Stewart Hayes commented that "it 
was a real good game, very exciting." The team travels to Long 
Beach this afternoon to face CSULB. ~. ')I M ....... GiHt

At this point we were not 
concerned with the win-loss 
record," said Hafferkamp. 

They were concerned, how-
ever, that the last game was 
their sixth consecutive loss, 
and the coach thought the team 
needed a talking to. "We talked 
about what the problem was 
and asked ourselves if we were 
winners or losers." 

Apparently the strategy paid 
ofr, as UCSD swamped Loyola-
Marymount 11-5 in the next 
game. 

Fifty minutes later, Cali-
fornia Maritime Academy 
became the aecond victim of 
the bom-aaaiD Triton squad. 
Crane and Loedel (eacb with a 
J!.Ilir of &oala" JOl"lenaea, and 

Ellietl put six points on tbe 
board against tbe two of tbeir 
competitors. 

Finally baving snapped tbeir 
losinj streak the day before, 
tbe team awoke Sunday to meet 
powerful UC Davis, the peren-
nial Far Western cbampion. 
Davis jumped on tbe Tritons for 
three quick scores, but UCSD 
foUibt back to trail 6-8 after 
tbree quarters. In the next 
period, though, the slim margin 
caved in as Davis struck seven 
times to win 15-7. 

Tbe three victories and four 
defeats of the weekend evened 
the UCSD season record at 10 
wins and 10 losses. Tbe team 
bas four games and the UC 
Riverside Tournament re-
maininl on the schedule this 
year.

John Back; Bones About Ash 
By William GibHn 

Here 1 sit on Saturday. 
haunted by an image of Ted 
Burke's glauea. ,linti." back 
at me in reproach for tbe 
tardiness of this article. as he 
sits composing another article 
excoriating his metier of Rock 
Critic. You see. last Thursday 1 
was at a beer and pizza party 
sponsored by EveUe Younger. 
to wblch he didn·t come. rather 
sent one of his flunkies to 
explain his positions on a 
number of issues. as his 
listeners glutted themselves. 
Not once did be mention Elton 
John's new album. A Slop 
Mao (MCA). so 1 can dilCuss it 
with political impunity. It's 
nice to hear an album like this; 
finally Elton has rediscovered 
his talent. has doffed his 
cosmetics both physical and 
musical to bring ua a disc 
reminiscent of Madmaa Acro .. 
&be Water or Hoaky Cllatea ... 
renective, stirring. melodic. 
Once again be is drawing from 

worthier .tylel of muaic (Sa .... 
real Soul. Gospel) than the 
vapid Rock wbicb pervaded bis 
middle period. He no longer 
writes with Bernie Taupin (is 
ergo a Single Man?), and Gary 
Osborne's lyrics are a touch 
preachy. but at least less self-
righteous than Taupin·s. El-
ton's piano is predominant 
here. is beautiful. Though the 
album seems a bit over-
produced. it is a nice addition to 
what has been an astoundingly 
good year for pop music. 

Another good selection is 
Wisbbone Ash' s No Smoke 
WUboat Fire (MCA). I've 
always found their simpUstic. 
neo-barbarian lyrics insup-
portable. but bere they are 
surrounded by smooth. incisive' 
double-guitar melodies and up-
tempo. semi-syncopated bass 
lines of the type now associated 
with The Alan Parsons Project 
who (just by the way) have 
made another album. entitled 
Pyramid (Arista). 

Ditto with AI Stewart's Tbne 
Puaapa (Arista). produced 
by Parsons. Whatl wanttotake 
issue with is the covers of the 
records. both by Hipgnosis. 
What sort of malarkey are 
these bastards trying to foist on 
us. anyway? First we see a 
picture of Alan Parsons sitting 
up in bed, hand to forehead. 
presumably contemplating 
The Answer. then we get a 
glimpse of Stewart changing 
physical reality (or maybe the 
listener's perception of it!?) 
with his music or. worse yet. a 
gesture of the hand. 1 mean. 
come on fellows. give us a tiny 
break; surely the rock music 
fanatic isn't that lost in counter-
culture fantasies. to believe 
that these craftsmen of noise 
have any sort of mystical vision 
or preternatural power. Why do 
they imply this? 1 f this is indeed 
the implication. neither of these 
men live up to it. 

Around Town 
Another new item is Richard 

Wright's Wet Dream (Colum-
bia). Wright, Pink Floyd's 
keyboardist. upholds the grand 
Floyd tradition of bitching 
about Just About Everything 
about Modern Life. The music 
seems to be an afterthought The Atomic Cafe. a con-

compositionally, but is llnely 
played by a group of British 
musicians. Mel Collins' sax is 
the most outstanding. but his 
talent is chained by Wright's 
seeming requisite of an evan-
escent. nuid sax line. Reg Iso-
dore plays drums. Snowy White 
guitars, Larry Steele bass. all 
capably. Wright plays mostly 
acoustic piano. with a different 
style than on most of the Floyd 
Albums . lending a sort of 
" Ioungy" effect (I have no 
business being a music critic) 
to the sedate tunes; the album 
is very pleasant. and I can't 
even complain about Hipgno-
sis' cover art. Now, if you're 
looking for some good local 
talent. I can suggest the Evelle 
Younger Scholarship Band.

College 
Naming 

(Continued from page 1) 
"we will have at least one open 
hearing." "It is my personal 
hope." she adds, "that as many 
students as possible can be-
come involVed." 

The Task Force was formed 
at the first Third College 
Council meeting held last week. 
Members in the Task Force 
include students Sung Choe. 
Andy Nahas and Pretrice 
Curry. Faculty members Mike 
Col e. Carlos Blanco and 
Charles Thomas will also help 
comprise the new committee 
and Varga will serve as com-
mittee chairperson. 

In a related incident. the AS 
Council passed a resolution two 
weeks ago endorsing the 
"rigbts of the Third community 
- students. faculty, and staff -
to select the permanent name 
of their college. "Their decision 
was unanimous.

income tax credit for renters. 
"As Libertarians. ultimately 
we want to fund all of society's 
functions on a voluntary 
basis." he said. 

In other areas. Clark advo-
cated the extensive "privatiz-
ing" of society and "giving 
individuals more control over 
their own lives." He proposed 
private funding of services 
such as garbage collection. 
police protection and road 
maintenance. He is in favor of 
relaxing zoning laws and 
bUildilll restrictions to a How 
more apartments to be con-
structed, thus keeping rents 
down throu,h an increased 
supply of available units. Clark 
expreued opposition to both 
Propositions 5 and 8.

.eeL, Nov. 1. 1178 

ash Plentiful in Mountainous Nepal 
c."ed from.-.e S) 

DI press crankilll out the 
news. It's a town for 

wa riDl, for takilll In the 
s~tI and smells. 

Tbe experience of Katmandu 
WOliN be worth creat expense. 
Fortunately, In addition to 
beiDI one of the nicest places to 
vilit, it is also one of tbe 
cheapest. $1.50 will ,et a fine 
double room in one of the many 
botels in the downtown area. 
The finest way to explore 
Katmandu Valley is by bicycle. 
They are easily available for 
25e per day. For those not 
inclined to pedal, bus, mini-bus 
or motor-rickshaw are all 
priced around a nickle. 

Food is another season 
Katmandu has become a haven 
for the low-budget traveler. 
Restaurants are everywhere. 
The local fare is very cheap; 
rice and dal, a Ientile soup, are 
available for about 20¢. Re-
cently, many places have 
opened which cater to the 
Western traveler. The memory 
of Aunt Jane's chocolate cake 
still makes my mouth water. 
Smoothies made from tropical 
fruit are another popular item. 
My most memorable dish was 
cultured yak milk. Served hot 
or cold, it tastes like liquid 
cheese cake. It is also very good 
at settling the stomach after a 
dinner of buffalo curry and 
apple pie. 

The large number of pie 
shops in town is no doubt 
related to the fact that Nepal 
produces some 'of the best and 
cheapest hash and ganja in the 
world. As a result, Katmandu 
has become a drug center of 
sorts where any of the popular 
"recreational" drugs are 
readily available. When I first 
arrived, I asked the owner of 
my hotel, as he was handing me 
my towels, if it was true that 
they smoke hash in Nepal. He 
reached into his pocket and 
threw a large black chunk on 
my bed. " Tell me if you want 
more," he said. No mention 
was ever made of price. I 
concluded it came with the 
room. 

Hash was openly sold in 
government stores until a few 
years ago when U.S. pressure 
forced them to close. For all 
intents and purposes, however, 
it is still legal. A large mari-
juana tree grows across the 
street from the Peace Corps 
headquarters. This openness is 
great for those who can control 
their intake. Unfortunately , 
large numbers of Westerners 
get carried away to the point 
where the drug becomes the 
central focus of their existence. 
Many become addicted to 
opiates and suddenly find 
themselves short of the cash it 
takes to get home. Several 
times I was approached by 
these people asking for money. 
After seeing people die of 
starvation in Calcutta, I found 
th •. idea of Westerners joining 
th -a ranks of beggars dis-
Igusting. For those who love 
can abis, most of Asia is a 
pc: radise. Honestly evaluate 
ycurself. Make sure the drugs 
are flnding to your experience, 
nct isolating you from It. '1 ht: 
id . , especially on a journey, is 
n( t to get high. but to be high. 

rhere is another high in 
N'~J¥)l. This one can be found in 
n< her part of the world. It is 
the " over eights " - the 
mQuntain peaks over eight· 
thousand meters high . The 
power these great towers have 
over the land and the peopl 
below them cannot be de -
crib d in words. Even photo-
graphs can barely b gin to 
capture th massive plendor 

they possesl. One clear mom-
illl. the si,bt of Annapuma wal 
10 exhilaratilll that my friends 
and I be,an to sbout and dance 
from pure joy. One of the better 
books of pbotographs is in the 
Humanities Library. Titled. 
Everet&. TIle West RId,e. ~y 
Thomas Hombein. it begins to 
live the idea. 

Trekking simply means 
walkiDl to any of the hundreds 
of towns scattered throughout 
the country. It is by no means 
necessary to climb to seven or 
eight thousand feet to enjoy the 
spectacular views or the 
secluded village life of the 
Nepalese. The view from the 
bottom of a valley is as exciting 
as from the top. However. if you 
like to walk uphill, you will find 
permanent villages over 13,000 
feet, farming over 14,000 feet, 
pastures over 16,000 feet and 
meadows for grazing animals 
over 17,500 feet. Though the 
ridges are incredibly steep, it is 
fairly simple to trek to these 
truly unbelievable spots. You 
may obtain a trekking permit in 
Katmandu and pick up a 
trekking map. These are fairly 
reliable topographical maps, 
which show " roads" and towns. 
Guides are readily available 
and for an additional fee. they 

will even carry your backpaCk. 
Convenient as tbis may sound, I 
recommend goinl alone. For 
the guide wbo Is doiDl bis job, 
wbo never lets tired and wbo 
has walked this trail a thousand 
timet, the objective il under-
standably to arrive at a 
predetermined destination. 

Wbat often appear to be trails 
are actually the thoroughfares 
of Nepal - the only means by 
which the villages are linked. 
These roads are well-used, and 
often paved with bandplaced 
stones. Sbould any mainte-

nance be required, the first 
Nepalese who notices the 
problem will instinctively stop 
and fix it. Some of the larger 
villages alonl the more popular 
trails have "botels" for the 
trekkers. Dinner, bed and 
breakfast can be bad for about 
a dollar. In the majority of the 
towna, bowever. the people will 
invite trekkers Into tbelr 
homes. These generous people 
derive as mucb enjoyment 
from looking at you as you do 
from lookinl at them! They 
love the travelers, and will 

jump at the cbance of sharing 
tbeir home with one. 

Above all, ,0 now! The 
Japanese have already made a 
"lift" of taxis to Katmandu . 
The wealthy tourist's money 
and lifestyle are rapidly 
encroachin, on the ma,ic land. 
Already there is a $100 per ni,ht 
hotel at tbe Everest Ba e 
Camp, complete with bellport 
and oxygen in each room. Soon 
bumble Nepal may have all 
commercial trappin,l of 
another Switzerland. Maintain 
respect for the old ways, but 10!
