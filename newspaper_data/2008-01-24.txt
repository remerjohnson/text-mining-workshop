An Academic Senate committee is 
asking for campus input on revisions 
to UCSD’s current course-withdraw-
al policy, which members hope to 
change so that students are allowed to 
withdraw from a class only once.

The Committee on Educational 
Policy — the body heading the revi-
sion — began discussing the current 
course-withdrawal policy more than 
three months ago. Members analyzed 
different policies from other UC cam-
puses, such as a stricter one at UC 
Irvine, which requires a formal peti-
tion when requesting a withdrawal 
from a class after the add/drop period 
has passed.

Currently, UCSD does not 
require any petition to withdraw 
from a course, and a student can use 
TritonLink to drop a class repeatedly 
for an indefinite number of academic 
quarters. The unguarded accessibility 
of this option has consistently frus-
trated professors, said physics profes-

Courtney Coyle, an attorney representing one of the 
tribal entities concerned about the project, faults the 
university for poor communication with the community 
since the project began.

“There have definitely been some deficiencies in the 
process,” Coyle said. “It was only in the last couple of 
months that any substantive outreach or progress was 
made with the tribal communities.”

However, Executive Director of University 
Communications Dolores Davies said the university has 
made every effort to keep communication open with all 
constituencies.

“We have been and will continue to be responsive and 
have an open dialogue with all members of the commu-
nity,” Davies said in an email.  

UCSD is now proposing that UC President Robert C. 
Dynes, among other officials, meet with the interested 
parties to discuss the situation and formulate a project that 
will be mutually beneficial to all involved, Coyle said. 

“The goal should be that options could come back 
to the regents not for action but for their consideration 
for thinking about at the March regents meeting in San 
Francisco,” she said.

UCSD officials’ plans to demolish the historic 
University House were once again interrupted Jan. 14 
after state legislators and other advocacy organizations 
submitted last-minute letters of opposition. 

Since it was deemed uninhabitable in 2004, the uni-
versity and several local parties, including historians and 
various American Indian groups, have clashed over what 
to do with the structure and surrounding property. 

Campus officials believed the wait would finally end 
last week, when the UC Board of Regents was scheduled 
to adopt its reduced-scope construction plan during the 
Jan. 15-17 meetings at UCLA.

UCSD’s reduced-scope plan included reusing, when 
feasible, structural elements of the original adobe house, 
including remnants of the walls, ironwork and tiles. The 
plan also included an extensive historical archival record. 

However, letters from Sen. Denise Moreno Ducheny 
and Sen. Christine Kehoe, asking for the matter to be 
deferred until more discussion takes place, forced the 
regents to postpone actions on the item. 

“I became involved because local tribes, the La Jolla 
Historic Society and members of the community let me 
know they had concerns about a historic site being razed,” 
Kehoe said.

Ducheny said she became concerned when it appeared 
that UCSD had ended negotiations with the local groups. 

“UC officials also appear to have cut short discussions 
with tribal entities and may not have completed consulta-
tions that could result in feasible project changes to satisfy 
both tribal and university needs,” Ducheny said in a Jan. 
11 letter.

During committee meetings aimed at re-evaluat-
ing both the Sun God festival’s specific operations 
and broader purposes, administrators and campus 
programmers are prioritizing student safety issues that 
could mark a swath of changes to the daylong event 
and the evening concert itself.

The annual festival is a massive financial and 
logistical undertaking that attracts tens of thousands 
to campus with its nighttime concert, and costs nearly 
$250,000 in security, technical staff and artist book-
ing fees. 

In the first meeting of the planning committee 
charged with discussing and possibly implementing 
changes to the event, members focused on parking 
and transportation issues. Transportation and Parking 
Services officials gave an initial approval to proposals 
to shut down Hopkins Parking Structure during the 
concert, using the site as a temporary entrance to 
RIMAC field. Brian Ross, assistant director of campus 
events for the University Events Office, said that the 
solution was reached in a large-scale effort to empha-
size safety at the concert.

“The committee wanted to do something other 
than debrief past errors,” he said, referencing problems 
of overcrowding, which instigated disorderly activ-
ity at last year’s event. “We want to highlight specific 
plans of action, like opening the parking structure so 
we don’t have thousands of students pouring down 
Ridge Walk to get into the concert.”

The committee’s next meeting will concentrate on 
issues of advertising and marketing, Ross said, which 
UEO hopes will help shift students’ perceptions of Sun

NEW POLICY 
COULD PUT 
CAP ON ‘W’ 
MARK USE 

By Sam Huang
Contributing Writer

After several Thurgood Marshall 
College councilmembers criticized 
Marshall Provost Allan Havis for 
allegedly cutting corners in choos-
ing the search committee to replace 
an outgoing dean, Havis authorized 
a student subcommittee last week 
that will appoint a third undergradu-
ate representative to the contentious 
selection panel.

One week after Marshall Dean of 
Student Affairs Ashanti Hands left 
UCSD on Jan. 11, Havis met with a 
group of TMCC members to justify 
his selection of the two student rep-
resentatives on the search committee  
that will field candidates to replace 
her. The councilmembers accused 
Havis of bypassing standard applica-
tion and interview processes with 
his selection, saying that excluding 
the student body from the process 
was detrimental to the committee’s 
purpose.

Havis responded by greenlighting 
an additional subcommittee that will 
elect a third student representative 
to the selection board, which con-
sists primarily of staff and faculty 
from the six colleges.

The two students on the cur-
rent search committee are TMCC 
Chair Lana Blank and Marshall 
senior Prince Ghuman, an intern 
at the dean’s office. While some 
councilmembers said they antici-
pated Blank’s appointment due to 
her council position, they expressed 
concern over the addition of 
Ghuman, who was chosen after a 
Marshall dean recommended him 
for the position. 

“We wanted a person of the 
Marshall students at large so that 
they could represent the student 
perspective,” said Kyle Samia, A.S. 
Council Marshall senator. “For 
Prince Ghuman to work in the stu-
dent dean’s office and to get this 
privilege is unfair. Just because he 
works in the dean’s office doesn’t 
make him more invested in Marshall 
College than any one of the other 
Marshall chairs.”

The council was initially con-
cerned because such committee 
appointments are usually done in 
a more democratic manner, Blank 
said.

“We were frustrated because nor-
mally appointments go through a

God from a day of rowdy unruliness to one of com-
munity building and campus relationships. Numerous 
complaints about the event’s linkage to alcohol were 
raised in an in-depth report released last quarter. 

The report listed a barrage of grievances from 
every campus department regarding the concert’s 
impacts on UCSD. Several subcommittees, dubbed 
“steering” bodies, were commissioned to discuss the 
report’s recommendations. The planning committee, 
whose membership is composed of A.S. councilmem-

bers, council programmers, UEO officials and UCSD 
administrators, was commissioned to pick through 
the subcommittee’s proposals to determine which 
ones it should implement.

Several councilmembers have voiced concerns 
over the report’s breadth, especially the plausibility 
of massive changes such as barring all students unaf-

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

Quicker Therapy Gives 

New Hope to OCD Patients
Campus researchers may have 

made groundbreaking progress 
on cognitive-behavioral therapy 
last week when they demonstrat-
ed that as little as four weeks of 
daily treatment can produce sig-
nificant changes in brain activity 
in obsessive-compulsive disorder 
patients.

Past studies have shown that 
cognitive-behavioral therapy 
causes a decrease in elevated 
activity along the frontal-subcorti-
cal circuits of the brain. However, 
these studies examined chang-
es over at least 12 weeks, the 
standard duration of OCD treat-
ment, making the discoveries of 
the most recent four-week study 
notable.

“First of all, we discovered sig-
nificant changes in brain activity 
solely as the result of four weeks 
of intensive cognitive-behavioral 
therapy,” Sanjaya Saxena, direc-
tor of the Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorders Program at the UCSD 
School of Medicine, said in a 
press release. “Secondly, these 
changes were different than 
those seen in past studies after 
a standard 12-week therapeutic 
approach using SRI medications 
or weekly behavioral therapy.”

The therapy, known as “expo-
sure and response prevention,” 
gradually eliminates patients’ 
obsessive fears or worries by 
desensitizing them to the objects 
or tasks that provoke them. 

“This is the primary kind of 
therapy used for OCD,” Saxena 
said. “It teaches patients to pay 
attention to their internal experi-

ences and tolerate scary thoughts 
without having to act on them. 
They learn that nothing terrible 
happens if they refrain from their 
usual compulsive behaviors.”

After a four-week session, the 10 
OCD patients in the study showed 
substantial improvements in symp-
toms as well as depression, anxiety 
and overall functioning.

Regents Choose New 
Leader of Budget Sector

In response to the recommen-
dation of UC President Robert C. 
Dynes, the UC Board of Regents 
appointed Patrick J. Lenz as its sys-
tem-wide vice president for budget 
on Jan. 17. His appointment will 
take effect no later than Feb. 25.

Known as one of California’s 
most knowledgeable experts in 
higher education funding, Lenz 
has served as the California State 
University system’s assistant vice 
chancellor for budget and held vari-
ous positions with the California 
Community Colleges, including 
working as the system’s executive 
vice chancellor.

In his new position as vice presi-
dent for budget, Lenz’s responsibil-
ities include developing, approving, 
communicating and implementing 
the university’s operating and capi-
tal resources acquisitions, alloca-
tions and long-term budget plans.

Dynes said Lenz will be a great 
asset to the university, especially 
considering the state budget chal-
lenges it faces this year. Executive 
Vice President Katherine N. Lapp 
added that having Lenz on board 
will allow the university to pursue its 
ongoing effort to improve budget 
management and representation.



THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  3

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue was the guest of honor at last night’s A.S. Council 
meeting. Despite some initial liveliness 
on Rue’s part, the soggy weather out-
side foreshadowed the serious conversa-
tion between Rue and councilmembers 
about new budgetary concerns and the 
state of UCSD’s mental health services.

Rue joined the meeting in a fashion 
uncharacteristic of most administrators, 
wearing a bejeweled crown seemingly 
drawn straight from the props bin of a 
Disney movie set. 

“I come to you 
today as the very 
recent winner of 
the office spirit 
contest for Spirit 
Week,” she said to 
applause, before 
setting the crown 
aside for the rest of the meeting.

She first courted a question from 
Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Long Pham about UCSD’s plan 
to respond to a proposed $400-million 
funding cut to the UC system.

Pham raised the regents’ sugges-
tion to cap enrollment as a means of 
preventing an increase in expenditures. 
Rue played down the impact of a cap on 
undergraduates, saying that UCSD was 
already approaching its growth poten-
tial in that area and would instead focus 
on growing its higher-paying graduate 
student population.

Earl Warren College Senator 
Kenneth Wong asked about how the 
budget cuts could affect student life, 
and Rue seemed confident in allaying 
fears about a downturn in state fund-
ing.

“If we’re adept, it will really not be 
that obvious to students,” she said. “We 
can delay filling vacancies … there can 
be a lot of savings that way.”

Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
changed the subject to improving on-

campus mental health services. 
Rue prefaced her response by 

observing that, unlike the situation 
at most other college campuses, stu-
dents here are diagnosed with anxiety 
more frequently than with depression. 
According to Rue, anxiety responds 
well to a “mind-body approach,” so 
UCSD would benefit from the creation 
of a wellness center that is currently in 
the early planning stages.

Rue explained her theory of a “tri-
age plan” for treating students in which 

they begin at the 
peer advisor and 
guidance counselor 
level before meeting 
with psychologists, 
based on severity of 
their mental health 
afflictions.

All Campus 
Senator Meghan Clair was the first to 
challenge Rue’s mental health philoso-
phy, saying that a month long waiting list 
to see a psychologist was unacceptable. 
Rue considered Clair’s suggestion of 
an “open door” psychologist in earnest 
but said that funding constraints would 
prevent it from becoming a reality.

Arts and Humanities Senator 
Samantha Peterson also questioned 
Rue about the overwhelmed men-
tal health services at UCSD. Peterson 
recounted a personal experience about 
the difficulty of seeking help at UCSD, 
a quest that ultimately resulted in a one-
week hospital stay.

“There’s no reason that service 
shouldn’t be available to us,” she said. “I 
spent an entire quarter trying to get an 
appointment, and it got more and more 
urgent. It’s a ridiculous mess of bureau-
cracy over there.”

Amid this council’s most poignant 
moment so far, Rue offered to speak 
with Peterson individually about solv-
ing UCSD’s deficiency in mental health 
services.

Mental Health, Budget Issues Among 
Councilmembers’ Chief Concerns

it earlier in the year; the latter pro-
posal was made by the Student Policy 
& Judicial Affairs department to ensure 
that cases of student discipline could be 
acted on by the quarter’s end.

At this week’s A.S. Council meeting, 
Sixth College Senator John Cressey said 
that the council could not support the 
costs of implementing all of the report’s 
recommendations. Thurgood Marshall 
College Council Chair Lana Blank 
said that while she found the report 
to be impressively thorough, some of 
the proposed changes are “very dras-
tic.” Former council President Harry 
Khanna publicly voiced his specific 
qualms over changing the concert date, 
which he said would make attendance 
problematic for alumni.

UEO Director Martin Wollesen 
said the report’s most extensive pro-
posals, such as the date-change, are 
suggestions for the future and not nec-
essarily bound to this year’s concert, 
which celebrated its 25th anniversary 
last year. He added that changing the 
date of this year’s event would adverse-
ly impact other departments that have 
already planned around it.

“The report is a black-and-white 
example of Sun God’s complexity, and 
how it’s inextricably tied to every single 
facet of student life and a multitude of 
campus nodes,” Wollesen said of the 
document, the first ever to delve into 
concerns raised over the concert. “We 
want to systematically grapple with the 
issues highlighted in the report, and 
use it as a jumping-off point to mold 
future Sun God events.”

Officials said the committee’s para-
mount concern is preserving safety. 
Last year’s concert saw a spike in the 
total number of arrests and citations, 
with many of the instances related to 
alcohol, illegal substances and nonaffil-
iates; the report found that 44 percent 
of arrests were nonaffiliates.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue said that she hoped to see 
role of nonaffiliates in Sun God’s prob-
lems reduced. She said she acknowl-
edges both the challenge of implement-
ing the report’s every proposal and the 
fact that the concert was reaching a 
“tipping point.”

“A lot of college celebrations have 
seen a trajectory similar to Sun God,” 
Rue said. “It starts as a home-grown 
event and develops to a point where its 
infrastructure is overwhelmed. But we 
believe it can be reined in.”

Rue added that many simple 
changes, such as not placing exits and 
entrances in close proximity, would 
streamline event operations and ensure 
basic safety. However, she specifically 
took issue with the large presence of 
plainclothes officers during Sun God, 
but said that the police department 
had flexibility in how it executed its 
safety measures.

“Sun God is about pride, and 
how it draws in students,” Rue said. 
“Unfortunately the number of students 
who have near-death, abusive experi-
ences is scary. So this committee will 
have to find that balance — how do we 
have a safe Sun God that doesn’t invade 
the student’s experience?”

A.S. Assistant Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland also said 
that the committee would have to play 
a delicate balancing act when deciding 
which proposals to implement.

“While everyone would like to 
have their way, the administration we 
have worked with are well aware of 
the trade-offs that will occur with the 
implementation of some recommen-
dations,” he said. “I feel that they are 
more often than not willing to accept a 
compromise if it contributes positively 
to the campus as a whole.”

sor and CEP Chair Kim Griest.
“There are a small group of stu-

dents who will repeatedly retake a 
class, which is to the disadvantage 
of other students,” Griest said. “They 
leave a lot of empty seats in class-
es which would have been filled by 
students who are willing to see the 
course through.”

The revised policy would allow a 
student to withdraw from a course 
only once. The next attempt at the 
class would have to be taken full-term 
for a letter grade. 

Although the revision could take 
effect as early as Spring Quarter 2008, 
the CEP agreed that the policy should 
not be retroactive, and previous 
withdrawal marks taken in a course 
should not count against a student 
until the revision is enacted.

“Students can take any number of 
courses and receive as many “W’s” in 
them as they want, as long as they do so 
before the policy revision takes place,” 
said A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Long Pham, the 
senate’s student representative.

Before any revision takes place, 
the CEP will send a brief overview 
of the proposed change via e-mail 
to UCSD students, staff and faculty, 
allowing two to four weeks for com-
ments. 

“When the policy takes effect will 
depend on how long the comment 
process takes,” Griest said. 

The policy revision will first be 
brought up to the Academic Senate, 
which will decide whether to imple-
ment the change. The proposed 
change would then be presented for 
campus review.

group selected of students,” she said. 
“There was no application process 
or interview conducted. It was not a 
process that we felt was democratic 
since committee selection was made 
by the administration and not the 
students.”

Havis, however, called the deci-
sion process routine.

“We’re just following and adher-
ing to searches of other colleges,” he 
said. “It’s the same protocol. There’s 
nothing unusual happening.”

He defended the current group 
against the council’s criticisms, say-
ing that he is confident in its ability 
to select a qualified dean.

“Selecting search committee 
members for a staff appointment can 
never satisfy all interested,” Havis 
said. “But we do feel this is a diverse 
group representative of many per-
spectives, and we are encouraged 
about the energy that this search 
committee is bringing to this proj-
ect.”

However, Samia said Havis 
neglected to inform Marshall stu-
dents that Hands would even be 
leaving. In addition, he said simi-
lar appointments are typically made 
after the council has been contact-
ed.

“In my personal opinion, the 
provost should have told us what 
was happening, and we would have 
been able to appoint a student, but 
he didn’t do that,” Samia said. “And 
because of the fucked-up problems 
that happened, Marshall Council has 
to be more reactive. He almost over-
stepped the normal way the thing 
is done.”

While the subcommittee’s cre-
ation represents an understanding 
between Havis and the council, 
some councilmembers still express 
concern that the body — headed 

Places in November, is situated on 
a sacred American Indian burial 
ground dating back to almost 10,000 
BC. 

The dispute over what to do with 
the house has centered on the desire 
of historians and American Indian 
groups to preserve the historical and 
cultural resources of the house and 
burial grounds. 

University officials have not 
viewed refurbishing the house as a 
feasible option.

“The 2004 Work Group reports 
the university did show that renova-
tion would be even cheaper than 
building a new structure,” Coyle said. 
“Either they or the donors just didn’t 
want to do it. It wasn’t a question of 
could they do it.”

The university did consider the 
option, but deemed it very likely that 
once a remodel was initiated, addi-
tional structural problems would be 
identified and the construction cost 
could significantly exceed initial esti-
mates, Davies said.  

LJHS board member Don Schmidt 
said the university’s proposed demo-
lition would not be able to prevent 
damage to remains in the burial 
ground.

All parties expressed optimism 
about the outcome of the scheduled 
dialogue in March.

“[UCSD] students really need to 
know about [the house],” Schmidt 
said. “It is part of their heritage. It 
is part of their history. I just hope 
the university and the regents move 
forward on preserving the house and 
the site, and continuing the dialogue 
with the greater community.”

Third Student Rep. to Judge 
Narrowed Candidate Pool

▶ MARSHALL, from page 1 by A.S. Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Neetu Balram 
— will only have a nominal role in 
the ultimate selection process. The 
third student representative, select-
ed by the student subcommittee, is 
only allowed to participate in table 
discussions after the general search 
committee has reduced its applicant 
pool to three candidates. 

“I originally didn’t know how 
input from [the student subcom-
mittee] was going to translate to 
the general committee,” Blank said. 
“There’s no guarantee of what the 
third representative says has any 
bearing. The fact that they only work 
with the top three candidates is only 
putting power in the hands of the 
original committee.”

Havis said he disagreed, contend-
ing that the third student repre-
sentative would have “a significant 
bearing” on the process, despite the 
fact that he or she will only par-
ticipate on the last day of the general

“I feel positive that we will have 
an insightful, wise, comprehensive, 
diverse search process utilizing and 
integrating many important compo-
nents and perspectives,” he said. “We 
have to do what we have to do as an 
institution. It’s hard to replace good 
people, but we will do our best to get 
another great dean.”

Despite the newfound compromise, 
some councilmembers remain wary of 
the exchange’s wider implications.

“The provost just doesn’t under-
stand the process yet,” Samia said. 
“It’s just the process that he’s just try-
ing to learn and be sensitive to. He 
just needs to learn how to interact 
with students in an administrative 
capacity.”

Journalist 
Helps Season 
Bright-Eyed 
Columnist

It’s a good thing that I don’t really like money. As a budding col-lege writer, if I were to pursue 
any plans of becoming a profes-
sional journalist, my future would 
not exactly guarantee a six-figure 
salary and a cushy 401(k).

As the Internet continues to 
flourish, offering the average person 
access to information that 20 years 
ago was available only via magazines 
and daily newspapers, the future of 
print media is in question.

Last week I had the great oppor-
tunity to have lunch with Evan 
Thomas, the managing editor of 
Newsweek, and was able to pick 
his brain on the upcoming presi-
dential election, the current state of 
American politics and, most appli-
cable to me, his thoughts and advice 
to the next generation of journal-
ists. 

Speaking to a crowd of a few 
hundred people the night before 
in Price Center Ballroom, Thomas 
addressed the issue of declining 
subscription rates for his magazine 
and the dynamic role that online 
news outlets have played. 

He spoke to the fact that online 
advertising is much cheaper than it 
is through print media, which has 
caused Newsweek to see many of its 
traditional sponsors pull the plug. 
According to a report of the State of 
the News Media, the three biggest 
newsweeklies — Time, Newsweek 
and U.S. News & World Report 
— lost a combined one million sub-
scribers over the last 15 years. 

As one of the top men at 
Newsweek, Thomas seemed a bit 
dejected when discussing the bleak 
future of print media and the trou-
bles it poses for his publication. But 
as an accomplished journalist, he 
will not bear the burden of journal-
ism’s future — he will be long retired 
by the time technology finally twists 
the knife into print media. 

So between forkfuls of my spin-
ach salad and mango cheesecake, 
I made a point to ask him what he

EDITORIAL BOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a 
week at the University of California at San 
Diego. Contents © 2007. Views expressed 

herein represent the majority vote of the edi-
torial board and are not necessarily those of 
the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 

the members of the Guardian staff. 

It’s not often that the views of two opposing groups share significant crossover, let alone converge on a 
point salient to both parties. 

However, such is the case following 
the audit of UCSD’s Preuss School, 
where both allies and detractors of ex-
principal Doris Alvarez are advocating 
a second, more exhaustive look into 
the charter school’s high-profile grade 
change scandal. 

With so much at stake — includ-
ing the future of the school’s students, 
which hinges upon the school’s reputa-
tion — it’s difficult to construct a con-
vincing argument as to why adminis-
trators should not commission addi-
tional investigations into the matter.

Based on overwhelming evi-
dence collected by campus auditors, 
it’s unlikely that any further statistical 
analysis — a method advocated by five 
UCSD professors — will do much to 
minimize the impact of the 427 grades 
found to be altered. While they are cor-
rect in stating that the analyzed grades 
did not constitute a random sample of 
all marks at the school, it appears — in 

light of testimony by former registrar’s 
assistant Julianne Singer — that the 
grade changes themselves were not 
haphazard, and mostly targeted toward 
Advanced Placement class grades. 

The group’s argument seems cen-
tered around the possibility that the 
changes amounted to chance error, 
although powerful evidence presented 
by Singer and others suggests this is 
little more than wishful thinking. Even 
if no other Preuss grades are found to 
be inaccurate, it would not lessen the 
severity of the situation as a whole, or 
make the administration’s proactive 
response any less of a necessity.

Nonetheless, UCSD’s recent com-
mitment to administrative transpar-
ency at Preuss is reason enough why 
the school should consider granting 
the professors’ request. 

The campus will be unable to 
recover from the scandal so long as 
any questions are left unanswered, and 
advocating further analysis should not 
pose any risk if the audit is as sound 
as university officials claim. In the 
scientific community, the best theories 

are the ones that survive rigorous peer 
review, and an issue so hotly contested 
could only benefit from an ultimate 
consensus about what happened and 
what should be done to remedy the 
problem.

By having the school’s operations 
investigated by an external consult-
ing firm, UCSD is making appro-

priate steps toward resolution and 
closure. 

Allowing other parties to exam-
ine the evidence and reach their own 
conclusions — be they statisticians 
or members of the Academic Senate 
— would only demonstrate UCSD’s 
renewed push for enhanced account-
ability.

Second Audit Would Help Ensure Preuss’ Integrity

The first of many Sun God Planning Committee meetings is a sign of things to come; 
whether that’s good or bad for students 
will be up to A.S. councilmembers. 
Specifically, the council’s program-
ming department will decide what to 
do with the Sun God 2008 Planning 
Report, 22 pages worth of inextricably 
muddied content. It will be a heady 
task, as that content is as effusive as it 
is broad — every campus department 
had its say, and those voices range from 
intense complaints to light grievances.

The filter to be used in prioritizing 
the flurry of proposals is safety, coun-
cil programmers say. It is the extent 
to which basic safety bows to basic 
entertainment that is most at question; 
a stronger officer presence encourages 
safety (and is undoubtedly supported 
by the campus police department), but 
does it ruin Sun God’s free-spirited 
ambience? This is where negotiation, 
bartering and back-and-forth dialogues 
will be key in preserving students’ love 
of their treasured daylong event.

So far, the negotiating parties 
appear to have sturdy heads on their 
shoulders. Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue took a much-appre-
ciated stance against undercover offi-
cers during this week’s A.S. Council 
meeting, supporting councilmembers’ 
sentiment that uniformed officers 
would make Sun God safer, while 
plain-clothed officers lead to a back-
ward route of enforcement. Officials 
from the University Events Office have 

proclaimed a “tied at the hip” partner-
ship with council programming, which 
gives them much-needed authority to 
rebuff complaints from administra-
tive departments used to strong-arm 
student voices.

Programmers, UEO and Rue are 
correct in admitting the near unman-
ageable nature of this era’s Sun God. It 
is a colossal undertaking that reared its 
ugliest angles last year, when entrance 
lines collapsed, ticketing operations 
imploded and the number of arrests 
shot upward. The problems in 2007 
heralded a perfect time to re-evaluate 
the festival, though it has opened the 
floodgates to on-campus departments, 
allowing them to throw every stick and 
stone at UCSD’s defining event.

Because of the report’s depth and 
breadth, the programming department 
must be wary of its own boundar-
ies and powers: What boundaries will 
it set to festival changes, and what 
power does it have to snub depart-
ments that believe their changes 
should take priority? The answers vary. 
Councilmembers love to voice pro-
gramming’s autonomy over its events, 
but administrators have muscled past 
that “Students have rights!” argument 
before. Baseline issues such as safety 
can give administrators a possible tool 
to regulate Sun God’s basic operations 
— changing the date of the festival, for 
example, is an unconscionable pro-
posal. Yet another concern is the pro-
gramming department’s approach to 
marketing and advertising, part of its 

attempt at changing the overall image 
of Sun God. But that image should 
be self-evolving and self-perpetuating, 
not a product of UEO, programmers 
and administrators.

Though there are problems that 
require some form of committee atten-
tion, and soon. The rising profile of 
nonaffiliates at the concert is causing 
multiple roadblocks. While completely 
restricting nonaffiliate access to the 
concert is extreme, it may be the only 
way to ward off the shockingly violent 
behavior of kids that have no concern 
for a campus that is not theirs.

So as the committee meetings 
progress, only time will tell what our 
children’s Sun God will look like — 
hopefully just as fun, just as commu-
nity-oriented and just as wild.

Programming Shouldn’t Drown in Open Floodgates

By Silhan Jin
Staff Writer 

SIX COLLEGES — For over 30 
years, Thurgood Marshall College’s 
motto has been “to develop students 
as scholars and citizens.” This stems 
from the college’s philosophy, which 
seeks to foster not only students’ 
academic excellence but also social 
responsibility. 

However, the recent conflict 

between Thurgood Marshall College 
Council and Provost Allan Havis  
looks to be just another instance in a 
long list of administrative neglect. 

But perhaps this attitude from 
the administration is really a tool to 
gouge the social responsibility out of 
students. 

UCSD undergrads are notorious-
ly apathetic, and it’s only reasonable 
for administrators — like Havis — to 
undercut the importance of their 
involvement. 

So when Ashanti Hands, 
Marshall’s dean of student affairs, 
resigned last quarter, Havis thought 
little of student input when he cre-
ated a search committee to find her 
replacement. 

He chartered the group over win-
ter break — when most students were 

away for the holidays, and appointed 
Marshall senior Prince Ghuman and 
TMCC chair Lana Blank to the com-

mittee without a proper application 
and interview process.

TMCC couldn’t express its frus-

tration quickly enough. Though 
councilmembers said Blank’s 
appointment was expected, they 
were upset with the other appointee. 
Ghuman, who was chosen without 
the council’s knowledge or input, 
was selected simply based on his 
work in a Marshall dean’s office. 

Trouble erupted as Havis refused 
to recognize his error; meanwhile, 
Ghuman remained missing in 
action.

The disagreement escalated when 
Marshall administrators refused to 
reschedule the search committee’s 
first meeting because of a conflict 
in Blank’s schedule. According to 
Marshall Senator Kyle Samia — an 
outspoken advocate of TMCC — 
Havis told Blank that the first meet-
ing wasn’t vital, further implying 

that her presence and input were not 
important. 

Samia and Blank both took 
offense to this, saying that it is not 
up to the administrators to decide 
which meetings are important for 
students to attend. And they’re right; 
Havis has already stepped extensive-
ly on the toes of UCSD’s most active 
students — he isn’t even pretending 
to care about their opinions. 

“It’s one thing to schedule 
[a meeting] when I have work or 
student government,” Blank said 
in an e-mail. “But when I have 
class [it] seems completely unfair. 
Administrators can change their cal-
endars and move meetings but my 
job is to be a student and I cannot

social responsibility 

out of students.”

7-0 record at RIMAC Arena, in addition to 
a 6-2 conference mark.

other estimates put them at 15 percent.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

thought I, as a starry-eyed, optimis-
tic college student, should do about 
any urges to join the journalism 
workforce. Being careful to avoid 
turning me off to the career, he 
chuckled slightly to himself before 
giving me some advice that seemed 
stressed and cautious.

“Find yourself a small newspaper 
that will allow you to write what 
you are passionate about; make sure 
it’s something that you really care 
about,” he said.

That’s it? Here’s one of the most 
celebrated journalists in the entire 
nation, and he tells me essentially 
the same thing that my kindergarten 
teacher told me when I told her that 
I wanted to be a pro baseball player: 
Follow your heart. 

I don’t know if I was expecting  
him to offer some piece of sage wis-
dom that would show me how to 
be a successful journalist, but I had 
hoped that any advice from such 
a prominent writer would contain 
something a little more concrete. 

After the lunch was over, I kept 
thinking about what he had said 
about the perils of print media 
as well as his advice to me as a 
journalist, and I realized that the 
two things are perfectly inter-
twined. Writers of previous genera-
tions were never assured lucrative 

careers, but they were safe knowing 
they held a basic monopoly on 
news, and that if they worked hard 
enough they could eventually earn 
a decent living. 

With less job security, aspiring 
writers are now forced to follow 
Thomas’ seemingly vague, but very 

crucial, advice and should only 
venture into the field of journal-
ism if it is truly what their hearts 
tell them.

Taking the chance of major 
financial gain out of the profession 
will create a pure breed of writers 
who are writing only because they 
honestly believe that a virtuous and 
dedicated media is a fundamental 
component of a working democ-
racy. 

If journalists can attain the same 

standing in society as teachers — 
very noble yet underpaid — a more 
informed American public will be 
created. My mother has been a pub-
lic school teacher for almost 30 years 
now, and my father apparently took 
Thomas’ advice decades before it 
was ever given, dedicating his life to 
working as a journalist and political 
activist covering grassroots social 
justice movements. 

Although both are unbelievably 
smart and capable people, my par-
ents chose to follow their hearts 
and took on careers that directly 
made the world a better place. My 
parents will be proud of me no mat-
ter what I choose to do, but I feel a 
lot better knowing that being a part 
of a new generation of journalists 
would serve a truly positive role in 
the world.

Maybe Thomas was just giving 
me a cliche answer, and maybe he 
was just blowing me off to hurry 
on to a more important meeting 
— or maybe his advice actually was 
sincere. 

Nobody is in a better place to 
understand the magnitude of the 
threat to print media and jour-
nalism than he is, and maybe he 
just wants to make sure that his 
beloved profession is continued by 
people whose hearts are in the 
right place.

Excessively High Activity Fees 
Put Strain on Strapped Students
By Aleks Savovic
Contributing Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— Recently, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger proposed a bud-
get that would 
severely limit 
state funding for 
the University 
of California. 

L awmakers 
in Sacramento, 
who admit that  
the state’s deficit 
has increased to 
about $14 bil-
lion, have said 
that state spend-
ing on academia needs to change in 
order to prevent even more fiscal 
irresponsibility.

Unfortunately, with projected 
state cuts to the UC system hover-
ing near $300 million, the viability 
of offering the current variety and 
quality of academic programs in 
the future is now in question. But 
the cut in state support also means 
that student fees will inevitably bal-
loon once again.

This is precisely why university 
leaders should start showing that 
they care about students by mak-

ing activity fees required only for 
students who actually benefit from 
their merits.

With education fees increasing 
seemingly by the day, the boon of 
an activity fee lost its persuasion 

long ago. 
While in the 

beginning of their 
academic careers 
students may have 
found the pros-
pect of using the 
school’s resources 
attractive, educa-
tion’s heightened 
cost has mitigated 
those prior ben-
efits.

Toward the end of every quar-
ter, students notice that the bill 
for the upcoming quarter includes 
standard expenses such as regis-
tration fees, books and parking. If 
not waived, there is also a fee for 
student health insurance. 

But then, from the abyss of 
monetary figures, there emerges a 
set of fees that would appear quite 
distinctive within the context of a 
learning environment. 

I’m talking about RUCCI: rec-

change my class schedules.”
But then again, from an adminis-

trative point of view this may appear 
as a further example of students’ 
indifference. 

Luckily, after a long debate, Havis 
and TMCC finally reached a com-
promise. They decided to add a sep-
arate search committee, predicated 
on the idea that it would provide a 
fresh perspective to the views of the 
existing committee. 

The only downside is that this 
new committee will not have voting 
powers, and will be able to only offer 
recommendations. 

Though the council attempted 
to convince the administration of 
the importance of voting power for 
the new committee, Havis wouldn’t 
compromise further.

Last year, a similar situa-
tion occurred during a review of 
Marshall’s Dimension of Culture 
writing program, when the council 
wanted student participation in an 
important curriculum committee. 
The council’s request was rejected, 
however, and students were instead 
offered a spot on a separate commit-
tee without voting rights.  

These two instances, in addition 
to the dearth of Warren College 
Student Council involvement in the 
recent general education require-
ment changes, are unfortunate exam-
ples of administrative disregard. 

However, blame for the lack of 
communication also falls on stu-
dents.  

Out of UCSD’s approximately 
22,000 undergrads, only a small 
minority is active through stu-
dent councils and organizations. 
Additionally, voter turnout for issues 
like referenda and student repre-
sentatives — which directly affect 
students — is relatively low. 

To administrators, this implies 
student apathy, prompting them to 
disregard the few students who actu-
ally take an active interest in school 
government. 

As students see that they must 
stand up and force UCSD adminis-
trators to take their opinions seri-
ously — the way TMCC members 
are attempting — they are pushed to 
develop into responsible citizens. 

So is there a method to what 
appears to be administrative mad-
ness? Involved students can only 
hope.

Unfortunately, the average stu-
dent does not have the time or the 
resources to keep themselves updat-
ed on new and upcoming policies 
and procedures. Some are too busy, 
while many are simply disinterested. 

But responsible on-campus citi-
zenship doesn’t always have to start 
and end with bureaucracy. It also 
includes the simple act of participat-
ing in school activities, or voting in 
A.S. Council elections. 

On UCSD’s apathetic campus, 
students need to work hand-in-hand 
with administrators in order to have 
their opinions considered. University 
leaders have a long history of stub-
born disinterest in student input 
— the situation with Havis is no 
exception — but if students are ever 
going to get their voices heard, they 
need to tone down the complaining 
and start working toward a mutual 
understanding. Administrators are 
never going to respect student sug-
gestions when they know they can 
get away with ignoring them.

You catch more flies with honey 
than you do with vinegar, and stu-
dents need to take the hint: If they 
want to catch the attention of admin-
istrators, they need to get involved. 

Until then, the administration’s 
attitude will not change.

reation, university, campus, college 
and ICA activity fees. 

It’s reasonable to assume that 
RUCCI covers the necessary 
upkeep expenses for UCSD recre-
ational facilities and entertainment 
programs.

But should students who never 
utilize these entities be obligated 
to pay up? For some, attending 
a free-to-UCSD-students Kanye 
West concert really isn’t a priority. 
So should these students still be 
required to pony up their monetary 
resources just to remain on the 
UCSD roster?

Budget wise, the state is facing 
red almost across the board. And 
with the current fluid condition of 
the national economy, California’s 
fiscal problems stand only to wors-
en before they improve. 

Yet, within the context of rising 
living costs, a looming national 
recession projected at better-than-
even odds and now an increase 
in UC student fees, it appears as 
though the educational margin-
alization of middle- and lower-
income Americans is expanding. 

In essence, people pay enough 
merely to live properly in California, 
and it brings the population no 
comfort knowing that its offspring 

will be forced into deeper debt, 
courtesy of an educational program 
that charges fees beyond its imme-
diate purpose: education.  

With costs rising, it is now 
imperative that administrators con-
sider sending RUCCI out to pas-
ture, with the intended effort to 
continue making UCSD education 
uniquely afford-
able relative to 
this university’s 
academic repu-
tation.  

Admittedly, 
the activity 
fees mentioned 
only amount to 
15 percent of 
the big kahuna 
— the education 
fee.  The abil-
ity to afford a 
couple hundred 
dollars may be 
less of an issue for some students 
than for others. But, ultimately, the 
concerns of the latter set of stu-
dents are just as important as those 
of the former.

Note that the idea is not to 
simply shut down RIMAC Arena, 
to stop the yearly Sun God festival 
or to limit cash for star bands to 
play at UCSD. No, the real premise 

is that activity fees should only 
be paid by students who acknowl-
edge that they will participate in 
UCSD activities. Furthermore, 
students who indicate that they 
will never participate in fee-based 
extracurricular events should not 
be required to pay for RUCCI. 

Only then can validation come 
to an efficient 
solution to the 
subjective prob-
lem of activ-
ity fees coupled 
with increased 
education fees. 

Besides, the 
magnitude of 
students opting 
not to pay for 
these fees is like-
ly to be small, 
as the major-
ity of students 
would probably 

realize that they would utilize the 
recreational facilities at least once 
weekly. In short, students who do 
wish to work out at RIMAC need 
to know that they will be paying for 
their caloric-reduction plan. 

As for those more keen upon the 
Cobb-Douglas function, they’ll be 
happier knowing they are not pay-
ing for an investment they’ll never 

realize.
In terms of enforcement, a stick-

er could be applied to each UCSD 
identification card, which would 
allow only those students to use 
RIMAC — similar to the Parking 
and Transportation Services sticker 
allowing students to travel within 
a set radius of UCSD. This kind of 
implementation would be simple 
and effective. 

Additionally, students who 
waive their activity fees could pur-
chase tickets for a specific event 
they wish attend at the nonaffili-
ate rate. This way students are in 
control of their activity spending 
and the university will still take in 
revenue for its services. 

But whatever the program may 
be, the point is to minimize the 
adverse effect that activity fees may 
have on talented, yet financially 
strapped, current and prospective 
UC students.

California is as diverse finan-
cially per capita as it is with respect 
to individual talent. It would be a 
shame for a university to impede 
the budding talent by heighten-
ing the importance of financial 
ability.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

L il Wayne has been something of a feature slut this 
past year, appearing on 
tracks with almost every 
mainstream rapper in hip-
hop, as well as releasing 
countless mixtapes (includ-
ing the highly entertaining 
Da Drought 3) easily adding 

up to several albums’ worth of material. 
Still, he has yet to drop his highly antici-
pated sixth solo album, The Carter III. 

So in comes The Leak, a puzzling 
EP released December last year to 
very little fanfare or promotion. 
The Leak is supposed to be a 
mini-compilation of Lil Wayne 
songs that serves as a precur-
sor for his upcoming album. 
The only thing is, a leak is 
supposed to create a buzz; 
an interest in the artist’s 

project, and in order for that 
to happen you would need to 

leak quality material (or at least 
entertaining in some form or fashion). 

No one in Lil Wayne’s camp seemed to 
remember that last bit.

Instead, what we’re left with is a pretty 

accurate portrayal of what Lil Wayne seems 
to be right now: all over the place, unfo-
cused, rapping like a maniac and slightly 
boring. The most exciting track is easily “I’m 
Me,” where Wayne does what Wayne does 
best: rap about himself, how much weed 
he smokes and how he makes much more 
money than you — and it sounds pretty 
damn fun. 

Too bad he can’t keep the same spirit 
going for the rest of the EP. “Love Me or Hate 
Me” and “Talkin’ ‘Bout It” are some of the 
most boring Weezy tracks in recent mem-
ory, as WF Baby phones in his verses over 
mediocre beats. “Kush” is a fun little track, 
but it’s nothing noteworthy or extraordinary, 
especially considering the standards Wayne 
has set for himself. “Gossip,” the track Lil 
Wayne debuted at the B.E.T. awards this 
past year, is pretty ridiculous. The track runs 
around how much Wayne has done for hip-
hop, yet how little he has been appreciated, 
which is particularly hard to believe — espe-
cially since Wayne has been on the cover of 
magazines, every remix in the past year and 
pretty much lauded from all circles. 

The Leak is a joke, the material is sub par 
and its timing is odd. More puzzling still: 
Who the hell is going to buy a crappy five-
song EP nowadays anyway?

WAYNE’S QUICK
LEAK SMELLS STALE

By Andres ReyesHARDCORE vs. 
CASUAL = 

GAMING FTW
I find it surprising that a gaming column for the Guardian has yet to exist — the gaming industry is one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Though I don’t consider myself an expert in the 
field by any means, I thought it necessary that I some-
how contribute as someone passionate and willing to 
write about my favorite hobby. I didn’t start this col-
umn to play nice to gamers, or to attract more people 
to gaming; the purpose is to discuss aspects of gaming 
culture that deserve to be noticed. For example, crappy 
over-hyped releases will get bashed and under-hyped 
gems will be praised. For this intro-
ductory article, I specifically want to 
address two main types of gamers: 
the hardcore and the casual. As a 
disclaimer (the only disclaimer you’ll 
ever get), I’m a cynical gamer with 
strong opinions, so take what I say 
with a grain of salt.  

Everyone has their own image of 
the typical hardcore gamer, but I per-
sonally don’t have any problems with 
World of Warcraft players, or those 
cosplay types at every anime convention that look like 
cracked-out Halloween kids. The problem lies with 
the competitive gamers. See, unlike their role-play-
ing counterparts, these assholes suck the fun out of 
games. I don’t join Halo matches to get insta-killed for 
the two seconds I get to step on the map. I play these 
games online so I can enjoy that familiar single-player 
experience with other people — hence the term “mul-
tiplayer.” But multiplayer just doesn’t fucking work; 
there’s no reliable difficulty scaling. Ideally, the match-
making system implemented in every console game 
is supposed to bypass this problem, but it’s almost 
always broken and it doesn’t apply to online PC gam-
ing. Ultimately, I’m left to play matches against people 
with way too much time on their hands. Though I 
should put the blame on inconsistent matchmaking, 
I blame every hardcore gamer for being so damned 
good. Fuck you all.

On the other end of the spectrum lie casual gam-
ers, the people too pretentious to admit that they play 
games. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen someone 
pull out Brain Age on the DS and claim that they’re not 
playing a game, but rather enjoying a “brain-enhancing 
experience.” If you’re holding a mobile gaming device 
with a gaming cartridge inserted into it, you’re play-
ing a fucking videogame. This faction is too ignorant 
to understand what makes a game a game, and to 
make matters worse, they can’t discern good games 
from great ones. I’ve seen people at game conventions 
waiting in lines longer than the reproductive organs of 
horses to play Wii Sports. Wii Sports isn’t even a game; 
it’s a tech demo. I guess I’m more afraid than angry at 
these casual gamers for what they represent, which is 
the potential future of the industry. If big-name devel-
opers start making titles continually geared toward the 
casual gamer, will we lose our epic blockbusters? With 
the rise of games like Wii Fit, a glorified jazzercise mat 
that’s currently the most popular title in Japan, I sure as 
hell don’t want to find myself five years from now “play-
ing” Pilates with Mario as my instructor, as pictured.  

Despite my problems and concerns with these two 
gamer types, I can’t be completely cynical and claim 
that they are both detrimental to gaming. If anything, 
the hardcore and casual gamer provide the founda-
tions on which the medium can grow. I’m glad that 
some people love games enough to want to play them 
like a part-time job, and I’m glad that more and more 
people are gradually becoming interested in games, 
whatever form they may come in. As long as people 
are willing to enjoy the pastime for what it is, then our 
industry will have no choice but to prosper. So I say, 
rock on, gamers, rock the fuck on.

Critical Hit!

W ith James Brown long gone, the title of “hardest work-ing man in showbiz” might as well be passed on — and who’s a better candidate for that crown than Lil Wayne, mixtape master and urban poet extraordinaire? 
Traditionalists might cry blasphemy, but here’s a few facts to set 
ya’ll straight: 

Weezy hasn’t had a solo album release in two years, but has 
musical canon as long as his Cadillac.

He’s gotten every critic riding with him, from Washington Post 
pundits to MTV’s “hip hop brain trust.”

By producing track after track, and then some more, Lil Wayne’s 
career has diffused across hip-hop’s often cluttered landscape.

While most rappers only give us the means to bob and weave, 
Weezy’s effusive lyricism has a more imagistic moving power, plop-
ping us on his street corner one second, in New Orleans’ trashed 
ghettos the next, then throwing us toward Capitol Hill the second 
after that.

Best thing about Lil Wayne is, the man picked a new, previously 
underutilized way of maximizing his rep: mixtapes. In the last year, 
Lil Wayne single-handedly boosted the mixtape game, making 
appearances on a roof-high stack of tracks while spitting out some 
diamond-studded ones of his own.  

So while we all hunker down for Tha Carter III (which, judging 
from The Leak, could very well burn his career hard), here’s a look 
at the best tracks from Weezy’s most acclaimed mixtapes of the 
past two years: Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3.

Potter shout-out.     

Dedication 2
  

1. Canon (AMG Remix): An all-star list converges on this 
cut, which blasts off with a hailstorm of Weezy spitfire. 
Freeway washes the song over with more of his hall-
mark yelling, which fits perfectly in this fervent, wildly 
executed song. There isn’t rapping in this head-pounding 
ditty — the mic flails around before it smashes like glass 
against the concrete. 

2. Riding with the AK: Wayne preserves the Southern swagger of the Purple 
Ribbon All-Stars, whose “Kryptonite” thudded many a rear-view, bumped 
many a woofer and lifted many a trunk. Currency and Mac Maine bookend the 
song, but Weezy chokes the middle with speedy verve, professing the best gun-
toting love since Tupac rapped about making a girlfriend out of his piece. 

3. Welcome to the Concrete Jungle: In this cut, Dipset’s youngin’ urbanizes a 
dinky-dink cowbell beat with those lovable “yeps” and his pervasive fluidity. 
It’s a fitting lead-in for Wayne, who pours over his take on the streets with a 
sharpened tongue: “I won’t stop cappin ’til ya wings start flappin’/ And you, you 
just an angel in the street full of gangstas.”

4. Georgia Bush: What Kanye does, Lil Wayne can always do better. Instead 
of blabbering like a fool next to a dumb-struck Mike Myers, Wayne chooses 
the route of song to take stabs at the ignominious Dubya. The New Orleans 
native’s briskly agile flow meets perfectly with Ray Charles’ suave, making for 
a hellishly passionate assault of beefs on Bush. Then mid-song, Weezy grabs 
Tupac’s classic “Ambitions of a Rider” beat and whips up some even fresher 
Bush bitch-outs.

Da Drought 3
1. Seat Down Low: Wayne starts this cut with his trade-
mark sideways humility, first proclaiming T.I.’s standing 
as his brother and “the king,” and then going on to crown 
himself as “the best rapper alive.” Rap’s cutthroat charac-
ters need a lesson from Wayne, who knows tearing down 
peers doesn’t mean shit toward advancing your career. 
Backed by those Mannie Fresh’s beats that hearken divin-

ity and trumpets that open clouds, Wayne rides heavy on the track that made 
T.I.’s King one of 2006’s best solo efforts.

2. Get High, Rule Tha World: Reaching far back into ’90s classics, Weezy turns 
Nas’ pairing with Lauryn Hill’s “If I Ruled the World” on its head. Wayne’s lyri-
cism gets gritty (“I been shot two times/ Just wipe that off ”) as often as it gets 
ridiculous (“And I never miss a game, no Shaq O’neal/ More like Brett Favre”). 
Shout-outs to Favre and put-downs to Shaq always make for a winner.

3. N.O. Nigga: Any chance to see Young Jeezy’s romp redone is welcomed. And 
of course, as the prime example of the listener’s rapper, Lil Wayne is happy to 
oblige, slamming the song with the type of grunting rap that will have any head 
bouncing. His metaphorical side kicks in with a sweet declarative line: women 
share him like oxygen.

4. Put Some Keys on It: Wayne wrecks Rich Boy’s ’Lac by way of Polow Da 
Don’s addictive beat production and a barrage of pop culture references. 
Only this creatively conscious rapper can put Michael Jordan, Tonya Harding, 
Norbit and Orbitz shoulder-to-shoulder in one, outstretched breath. And it’s 
Wayne’s undeniable musicality that makes us love every strung-out verse.

5. Don’t Stop Won’t Stop: Let’s face it — Young Gunz were undeserving of the 
original pop-tastic beat. Wayne recoups the shame by partnering with the silky 
Nikki Menaj, whose flow is just as smooth when she’s repping her fine-ness 
as when she’s calling herself Hermione. And yes, that means there’s a Harry

Super Furry Animals
■ Hey Venus!
ROUGH TRADE

E nveloped by undulating swoons — oddly reminiscent of the Beach Boys on a spacey, psychedelic trip 
— it’s easy to understand why the 
appeal of Super Furry Animals has 
endured over a decade of mind-bend-
ing invention. The nonsensical neon 
album cover of their eighth install-
ment, Hey Venus!, is alone a reflection 
of the Welsh beasts’ ever-burgeoning 
imagination. Their latest explosion of 
sunshine-y doowop and bongo beats 
is a rainbow spectrum of weird, as if 
the awe-inspiring aftermath of some 
LSD-incited storm.

Although the album starkly fluc-
tuates between tambourine-backed 
harmonies and sophisticated piano 
grunge, the tunes serve to narrate 
the romance of a rural girl with big-
city ambitions. “The Gateway Song” 
is a 43-second crack of Brit-bubble-
gum, with frontman Gruff Rhys jok-
ingly assuring that it “brings you on 
nicely to the harder stuff.” Indeed, 
what follows are the Motown-inspired 

“Run-Away” and jazzy, lo-fi “The Gift 
That Keeps Giving” (a throw-back to 
2000’s experimental Mwng). But we 
aren’t truly blasted into electric shock 
until “Into the Night” turbo-charges 
the record with its Turkish twanging 
and techno swells of keyboardist Cian 
Ciarán.

The only stumble in the band’s 
audacious strut is the borderline-
annoying and largely pointless “Baby 
Ate My Eightball,” which badgers us 
with a stream of high-pitched la-la-las. 
But the elegant “Let the Wolves Howl 
at the Moon” more than compensates 
for this forgettable slip. “Wolves” is a 
hollow and blues-y waltz to the album’s 
close. And while its chorus escalates: 
“For the end/ it comes so soon,” we 
are reminded that, for every Furries 
finale, there awaits a new pitcher of 
creative juice to be squeezed from the 
pop powerhouses.

Vampire Weekend
■ Vampire Weekend
XL

I t’s hard to back a band that sings about Louis Vuitton and Peter Gabriel unironi-cally, but then again, I don’t live in 
Williamsburg, N.Y. The collegiate boys of 
Vampire Weekend cop traditional South 
African style and fit it into a three-minute 
academic pop box. This “world” sound 
has been branded innovative and cool in a 
new context, even if it amounts to a half-
baked, ska-Strokes approach with occa-
sional djembe beats. 

First strike: Ska tends to share a space 
with bagpipe jazz and Christian rap as 
a genre with no redeeming qualities. 
Thankfully, Vampire Weekend leaves the 
fluttery trumpets behind, but curiously 
saves the awful chord jangles (see “A-
Punk”). 

Second strike: This album isn’t going 
to age gracefully. A few days after the first 
listen, its trashy references are still embar-
rassing, and the college theme still an over-
done shtick. What happens when the four 
grads grow out of their campus fascination? 
Can they be sweater-tied scholars forever? 
Maybe lead singer Ezra Koenig will get a 
teaching degree and write as a professor for 
their second album. 

And strike three: There’s hardly an 
appropriate listening environment for this 
disjointed debut (besides Urban Outfitters 
and trust-fund yacht parties). Song parts 
often stand jarringly alone, as in new wave-
y number “One (Blake’s Got a New Face);” 
the band can’t manage to blend afro indie-
lite with Walkmen rock bombast, so it 
shuffles between the two awkwardly, sell-
ing both short.

That’s not to say their bookish antics 
never pay off: opener “Mansard Roof ” 
embraces minimalism well, with sparse 
but effective drum hits, symphonic/tropi-
cal keys and mandolin-style guitar strums. 
Koenig’s dynamic range and quaint melody 
on the track hints at a potential his group 
may or may not have. One thing is cer-
tain: if it weren’t for music blogs, Vampire 
Weekend would’ve spent an extra few 
months in the oven to everyone’s benefit.

The Mars Volta
■ The Bedlam In Goliath
UNIVERSAL

P ut your Adderall away, babies, or Mars Volta’s latest effort will give you a motherfucking heart attack. If you’re not down with extensive 
instrumentals and electronic layering so heavy 
Jesus couldn’t identify half the shit they play, then 
stay as far away from Mars Volta as you can get. 
The barrage of intense noise is so mind-numbing-
ly thick that you’ll either want to punch a fucking 
hole in the wall or do a hit of acid and run naked 
through Balboa Park. After numerous musician 
turnovers and member deaths, the group’s latest 
installment, The Bedlam In Goliath, is a twisting 
voyage into the band’s apparent “haunting.”

Totally theme-based, Bedlam relates the tale 
of the group’s haunted Ouija board, picked up 
by guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez on a trip to 
Jerusalem. In addition to providing the guys with 
oodles of lyrics and creative juice, the poltergeist’s 
overzealous ways apparently led to the flooding 
of several homes and the disappearance of entire 
tracks. Bullshit or not, the resulting fiasco of pul-
sating beats mixes electronica, mechanical warble 
and Indian chant into a buffet of sound.

The over-processed feel of Bedlam is at times 
delightful, like trying to identify all the indi-
vidual components of a delicious dessert. You 
dig through awesome guitar riffs, looping insane 
lyrics, synthesized bell chimes and the grounding 
presence of hectic drums. All that is Mars Volta 
is here in abundant experimental shifts, shoving 
more and more shit into every second of every 
minute of the album. But unless you’re on speed, 
listening to Bedlam in one go is like having musi-
cal schizophrenia, the lyrics usually lost in the 
clamor of Middle Eastern chaos.

Though successful in its avant-garde mess of 
rock ‘n’ roll, Bedlam fails to create truly stand-
out tracks. The songs tend to blur unless you 
hunker down next to the speakers and Google 
the lyrics. Singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala’s voice 
can also get pretty high in the register, becom-
ing a Weird Al Yankovic-like whine. Thankfully, 
Bixler-Zavala reins in his sonic pitch for most of 
the album, and the instruments get to hog the 
spotlight. The take-home message of Bedlam is 
not how beautifully crafted anarchy can be, but 
whether you enjoy the in-your-face-ness of track 
after track of kooky RPG lyrics and pandemo-
nium is really up to you.

S oft, dramatic and slow — Cat Power’s (AKA Chan Marshall) mostly new 
cover-based album slinks up 
on you like an unexpected 
Prince Charming at a dive 
bar. Drink in one hand and 
joint in the other, Marshall 
whisper-croons her thick-
bodied soul version of songs 
by artists like Janis Joplin, 
Billie Holiday and Marshall’s 
own lyrical crush, Bob Dylan, 
into your ear. 

But like any true shitty bar 
hook-up, what starts out as 
novel fun ends up fading with 
the first few drops of star-
tling sobriety. Marshall starts 
out strong, with a version of 
“New York, New York” that 
Frank Sinatra would be hard-
pressed to recognize, setting 
the mood for Jukebox as an 
intriguing tweak of classics 
into full-bodied, countrified 
blues numbers as only she 
can do.

Even if Sinatra couldn’t 
pick his song out of her 
musical lineup, the modifi-
cations enacted by the vet-

eran songstress are gritty 
and moving. She takes the 
grandstand out of New York 
and replaces it with a city 
that kicks your ass while it 
takes your name, infusing 
the old adage “I want to be a 
part of it” with a blush-wor-
thy sensuality.

She tackles some old 
material in the form of her 
grownup take on “Metal 
Heart,” a song originally 
heard on 1998’s Moon Pix, 
this time around pushing a 
wise intensity into the fragile 
lyrics of yesteryear. 

But the best moment 
of Jukebox happens when 
Marshall blatantly adores  
Dylan via the only original 
track on the album, “Song 
to Bobby.” It’s a frank admis-
sion of balls-out long stand-
ing Dylan-love: “Giving you 
my heart was my plan/ I wish 
I could tell you.” With her 
paper-thin voice backed by 
the Dirty Delta Blues, she 
creates a relaxing mix of cov-
ers that diverge from  2000’s 
The Covers Record.

But the gusto she injects 
into her country ballads 
and tunes of idolatry get 
lost around the middle and 
end when she tackles James 
Brown and Dylan. Rather 
than reinventing the magic of 
folk or R&B, she executes the 
verses almost too faithfully, 
maintaining the heart of the 
tune but dragging the music 
down in her own tragedy-
soaked voice. 

To both a benefit and a 
detriment, Marshall immers-
es herself in the music, slow-
ing it all down to toil through 
another artist’s work in her 
own melancholy fashion. By 
the end of the album, it’s 
hard not to mentally check 
out and head bob as the long 
journey comes to a close and 
the music’s lethargy peaks. 
Though a passionate collec-
tion, Jukebox is a slow-jam 
parade of hits that soothe 
more often than they stimu-
late.

site, the dosage increases 
until he bleeds to death.

From there the chase is 
on to catch the killer. Each 
new victim draws more 
attention from the press 
and a complicit American 
audience can’t help but 
watch. As the viewers 
increase, the victims die, faster and 
faster, while the killer absolves him-
self of blame. The message is made 
even clearer in an FBI statement to 
the press, “We are the murder weap-
on!”

“Untraceable” fails not for copy-
catting genre icons or for leaving 
out the gratuitous nudity, but for 
overreaching political statements. 
The Web site only allows American 
web-goers, obviously commenting 
on the amoral popularity of shock 
videos like “Faces of Death” that 
crowd the Internet. Less obvious, but 
no less pretentious, are the fascist 
overtones. There’s a strong desire to 
condemn the film’s glorification of 
belligerent FBI actions, but when the 
audience cheers at the most offen-
sive moments, it’s hard to deny how 

Two highlights from Brooklyn’s 
glut of buzz-rockers bring their own 
kind of party to the Casbah this 
Friday. Yeasayer celebrates a post-
apocalyptic rave fueled by tribal 
jam sessions, and MGMT makes an 
arena-sized tribute to pop history 
that transcends the group’s ultra-
modern sheen. The former’s single 
“2080” details the awful truths of the 
present day through a soaring chorus 
and sidestepping guitar arpeggios; it 

reaches its peak when the vocal hollers 
and rumbling drums beg for people’s 
attention. MGMT just wants to take 
pop craft to its next logical step, not 
reinvent the song, and “Weekend Wars” 
polishes classic glam-rock themes 
‘til they glow. Local up-and-comers 
Calico Horse introduce the night 
with a confessional indie ambience, 
an organic and reverberating take 
on traditional guitar-bass-drum 
instrumentation. (CK)

war-torn regions of Africa are a dime a 
dozen. With the increasing attention on 
the continent (albeit very, very slowly), 
you might look at “War/Dance” with a 
“here’s another one” mentality. What 
you’ll be missing — and what sets 
this story of musical hope apart from 
its counterparts — is the brilliant 
choice by directors Sean Fine and 
Andrea Nix to focus not solely on the 

violence in Northern Uganda. Rather, 
they close in on the hope its displaced 
and orphaned kids find in music and 
dance as a vehicle for personal and, 
by proxy, national peace, as they 
journey to their nation’s capital to 
compete in its annual festival. The 
film, an Oscar nominee and winner 
of Best Documentary at Sundance, 
will open at the Ken Cinema for one 
week. (CM)

KEN CINEMA / OPENS FRIDAY“War/Dance”

By Josh Christensen
Senior Staff Writer

Some of the Internet Movie Database’s keywords for “Saw”-in-cyberspace “Untraceable” 
include: snuff, torture, serial killer 
and shirtless male bondage. At least 
if super-MILF Diane Lane isn’t 
your draw, you’re not left on the 
sexual gratification lurch. You get 
enough of both in another crime-
thriller knockoff about the dark 
side of curiosity. 

Told from the perspective of a 
cop single-mom doing her part to 
stop illegal downloads, the movie 
comes across like the Motion 
Picture Association of America’s 
“Piracy is Theft” commercials. But 
instead of asking, “You wouldn’t 
steal a purse, would you?” the 
question is “You wouldn’t log on 
to a snuff site if it would help kill 
the victim, would you?” For most 
of us, sadly, the answer is a firm 
yes. The movie opens with FBI 
cybercops employing every trick 
in the Gestapo/KGB manual of 
yesteryear to bust a 12-year-old

little Billy is behind bars, a real

Desperate for more computing

But their boss doesn’t mind a

concerns until a man turns up on 
the site, tied to a bed frame with 
the Web site’s logo, Killwithme.

gather around the monitor to 
watch, the victim is injected with 
a serum that prevents blood from 
clotting. As more people visit the

“Hostel,” “Saw” or any other 
torture-porn entertainment, 
these people buy tickets to 
revel in gore. And they get 
plenty. Not quite as inventive as 
“Saw” tortures, our latest cyber 
killer (yes, they’ve coined a new 
crime) burns one man alive 
with heat lamps, boils another 
in sulfuric acid and — most 
disgusting of all — snares a kit-
ten in a rat trap only to watch 
it slowly die. Lulu the cat was 
clearly animatronic, but that 
doesn’t mean you can’t cry for 
her.

Tritons Crush Cross-Town Rival Toreros

contests, while the women also took 
three events of their own.

The women’s swimmers showed 
that the USD Toreros could not 
keep up with them as they won 12 
of the 14 events in the matchup. The 
Tritons even took first and second 
place in several events, including the 
200-yard freestyle relay. Freshman 
Anju Shimura and junior Shannon 
Simonds were the top two finish-
ers in the 200-yard freestyle, while 
junior Erinn Deters and Simonds 
placed first and second, respectively, 
in the 100-yard freestyle. Deters also 
won the 50-yard freestyle with a 
time of 24.60, while Simonds won 
the 500-yard freestyle in 5:12.98. 
Shimura also won her second event, 
the 200-yard backstroke, in 2:08.65. 
Junior Jennifer Sims won both of 
her events with a 58.48 in the 100-
yard butterfly and a 2:07.78 in the 
200-yard butterfly while sophomore 
Karla Holman took the 200-yard 
individual medley with a time of 
2:13.30.

The Triton women made amaz-
ing individual showings, but they 
also dominated as a team. They won 
the 400-yard medley relay with a 
powerful combination of Shimura, 
Bohn, Sims and Deters that finished 
in 3:59.97. 

The women divers did just as 
well as their swimming counter-
parts, as the Tritons took second, 
third and fourth in the three-meter 
diving with sophomore Jennifer 
Lappe, senior Amanda Mason and 
sophomore Danielle Niculescu. The 
Tritons ended the meet against USD 
with a solid victory of over fifty 

points. 
“Coming from [Loyola 

Marymount University], we did 
awesome against USD,” Shimura 
said. “We did a total 180 and came 
into this meet with a completely dif-
ferent mentality.”

The team traveled to the Schaal 
Aquatics Center in Davis next to 
take on the Aggies. Although the 
men lost a close match and the 

women lost badly in points, the 
team won several events, and the 
divers had a great meet. 

“Davis is a Division I team with 
scholarships and a full team,” Sims 
said. “We just wanted to have a good 
meet as a team and show Davis that 
we are a threat.”  

The Tritons swept both the men’s 
one-meter and men’s three-meter 
diving, placing first through fourth 
in both events with senior Andrew 
Skewes winning both events and 
sophomore Kevin Sullivan, senior 
Jeff Bryant and senior Aaron Cantu 
following close behind. The Tritons 
also won six other events as a team, 
three for the women and three for 
the men. Freshman Brandon Maryatt 

won the 100-yard breaststroke for 
the men with a time of 59.71. The 
men’s team also swept the 400-yard 
individual medley, filling all four 
top spots. Junior Steven Hardy won 
the event with a time of 4:19.42, fol-
lowed by junior Kneif Lohse, junior 
Dan Gluvers and freshman Kyle 
Begovich. The men also took first 
and second in the 400-yard freestyle 
relay with a team of sophomore Todd 
Langland, Maryatt and sophomores 
Greg Goodell and Dan Perdew, with 
a winning time of 3:11.82. 

On the women’s side, Sims won 
two events, the 100-yard butterfly 
and the 200-yard butterfly, in 58.68 
and 2:07.25, respectively. Shimura 
also won an event for the women 
with a leading time of 2:07.04 in the 
200-yard backstroke.  

Finishing the weekend with 
one win and one loss, the Tritons 
only have one more meet to pre-
pare for the Pacific Collegiate Swim 
Conference Championships and 
NCAA Division II Championships. 

“This weekend we asserted that 
we are the best team in San Diego,” 
junior Aubrey Panis said. “It was 
exciting and we have a lot of motiva-
tion going into conference champi-
onships.” 

The Tritons’ last home meet will 
be Jan. 26 against UC Irvine and 
Cal Baptist University. After that, 
the team will head to Long Beach 
for the PCSC Championships in 
February in what will be the Tritons’ 
last chance to qualify swimmers and 
divers for nationals.

the meantime, only a grassroots move-
ment by UCSD fans can strengthen 
sports programs at UCSD. Considering 
that students are paying well over $300  
a year toward athletics, one would 
think they would take a more active 
role in on-campus sports.

More home fans will translate into 
more wins, which will help build up the 
championship tradition, bringing in 
more top recruits and leading to a very 
bright future for Triton athletics. UCSD 
can try and lure the best talent to its 
program, but who would want to go 
to a school where your hard work and 
skill aren’t respected or even noticed by 
the student body?

Lately there has been a growing 
movement on campus to bring a foot-
ball team back to the school. While it 
would be great if the university were to 
have a football team again after a 40-
year hiatus, it is by no means feasible 
anywhere in the near future. Clinging 
to false hopes of forming a football 
team gives those students personal jus-
tification for not attending games of 
the few dedicated teams that the school 
actually has. If even the smallest frac-

tion of the almost 3,000 students in 
the “Bring UCSD a Football Team!” 
Facebook group were to attend a Triton 
game once a week, the attendance at 
home games would skyrocket. 

While money from the referendum 
does its best Ronald Reagan impres-
sion, slowly trickling down through 
Triton athletics programs, UCSD stu-
dents must take it upon themselves to 
improve school sports from the bottom 
up. And if bolstering UCSD sports and 
spirit is not enough of an incentive, then 
maybe this is: Each student is paying 
this fee regardless of how the teams per-
form, so not being active in the Triton 
sports program means that, essentially, 
you are wasting your money. 

Without the strong fan support, 
UCSD teams are merely a few students 
running around a field — regardless of 
how much more money may or may 
not be behind them. If the school is ever 
going to have a chance at competing on 
the same athletic level as the other top-
tier universities that UCSD students 
claim to be on par with academically, 
then each student must realize their 
dynamic potential and put their (refer-
endum) money where their mouth is.

Women’s Rugby Set 
to Start League Play
By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

CLUB SPORTS — This year’s edition 
of the UCSD women’s rugby team is 
admittedly a little younger and a little 
smaller than its fellow competitors, but 
that hasn’t held it back.

Competing in what has been con-
sidered the fastest growing women’s 
sport in the nation, UCSD has helped 
forge the way for West Coast teams. 
The sport is profoundly more popular 
back east, where teams receive more 
funding and have larger squads.

Despite the roadblocks it has faced, 
the UCSD squad has built a reputation 
for itself and now competes against 
Division I foes Arizona State and UCLA 
in the SoCal League. 

But before league play gets under-
way, the Tritons traveled to Stanford 
University on Jan. 19 and 20 to compete 
in the Stanford Invitational and get one 
final tuneup. As last year’s national run-
ner-up, Stanford headlined the 16-team 
field, which included many other top 
teams in the west.

Team president and captain Kim 
Wise said the team made great strides 
competing at such a high level and was 
proud of the team’s fourth-place finish.

“Everyone played really well this 
weekend and the rookies really stepped 
it up,” she said. “We’re a young team 
this year, and we lost some key players 
during the matches. Had a few things 
worked the other way, we could’ve 
come away with some more wins.”

UCSD opened up against Chico 
State and the Wildcats downed the 
Tritons 10-5, but the results weren’t 
considered official, according to Wise.

“Chico was playing its alumni so the 
game didn’t really matter,” Wise said. 
“It was more of a friendly match and a 
warm-up.”

After the opening match, the Tritons 
faced UC Berkeley in what grew into an 

80-minute grudge match. UCSD was 
forced to play shorthanded for the bet-
ter part of the match when two players 
went down with injuries. Despite the 
disadvantage, the Tritons played with 
a vengeance but came up short in the 
end, losing 15-14.

The injuries played a large role in 
the heartbreaking defeat, as the Tritons 
spent more time playing defense instead 
of trying to advance the ball.

“If we had had one more person, we 
could’ve won,” Wise said.

UCSD didn’t let down; the rookies 
helped the Tritons shut down out-of-
state foe Oregon State 39-0 to close day 
one with a victory and gain momentum 
heading into the second day.

On the second day, the Tritons 
faced rival UCLA and tournament host 
Stanford and came away with a split 
decision. UCSD took home a promis-
ing win against conference rival Bruins 
and will look to build off the confidence 
that came with the victory.

The afternoon match against the 
Cardinal was a different story. Wise 
said that while the Tritons were excited 
to play a team that expects to make the 
national tournament, it’s intimidating 
to play such a great program.

“They were one of the best teams 
in the nation last year and have a great 
program,” she said. “It was a close match 
but they are just a good team. We really 
learned a lot about our team from play-
ing them and we are excited to move 
into our regular season.”

The Tritons will head east next for 
a friendly match against the University 
of Arizona and a conference match 
against Arizona State University. Wise 
said the team is confident that they 
can come away with two victories and 
build some momentum heading into its 
matchup against UCLA.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2008

Senior Staff Writer

FENCING — UCSD sent a select group 
of its top fencers to Atlanta this past 
weekend for the 2008 North American 
Cup, where they faced their toughest 
competition to date. However, due to 
the meet’s unusual format, the sub-
par results will in no way affect the 
Tritons’ NCAA standing, because the 
NAC was an open competition where 
fencers were represented individually, 
with no points going to any type of 
team tally. 

Although the Tritons have par-
ticipated in this format of play before, 
most recently at the UCSD-hosted 
Bladerunner competition, NAC 
posed the unique and unsurpassable 
challenge of fielding a huge number 
of participants, all of whom were 
rated extremely high in U.S. Fencing’s 
qualification ratings. In fencing, the 
top three divisions, A, B and C, sig-
nify years of commitment and an 
abundance of talent, with the lower 
divisions, D and E, encompassing 
newer, less experienced fencers. All 
NAC participants held at least a C 
rating.

Senior foilist Emily Lipoma 
expressed the common sentiment of 
the team — one of resigned frustra-
tion — but made a point to focus 
on a silver lining from the trying 
competition. 

“Overall, it was pretty disap-
pointing; actually in every way it 
was pretty disappointing,” Lipoma 
said. “However, we were exposed to 
some very good fencing from all over 

North America and were able to see 
many of the top U.S. fencers fight for 
the top.”

NAC consisted of an open-
ing round of pool play, in which 
each fencer dueled to five touches 
against six other participants. From 
the open pool, the qualifying fenc-
ers then moved into more selec-
tive direct elimination rounds. The 
extremely talented and large field of 
competition at NAC made passing 
even the first round of pool play 
very difficult for the Tritons, and 
many of UCSD’s fencers were sent to 
the sidelines before entering direct 
elimination. 

In men’s epee, there were an 
astounding 281 entrants, and with so 
many top-notch fencers, tournament 
rules only permitted 75 players to 
move from pool play to direct elimi-
nations. Freshman Jed Bassein led 
the way for the UCSD epee squad, 
finishing a relatively respectable 
136th. Competing in the junior divi-
sion of the meet, sophomore Sean 
Blum placed 88th out of a pool of 
187 fencers. On the men’s side, fresh-
man sabrist Zach Jones advanced 
farther than any other Triton in the 
top division of sabre pool play and 
direct eliminations. 

Since NAC operates separately 
from the NCAA rankings and stand-
ings, the meet served as a person-
al challenge for individual fencers, 
allowing those who did not meet 
their personal expectations to use 
the competition to polish their skills. 
Sophomore foilist Florance Lee, who 
did not advance past pool play, real-

ized that the negative outcome of the 
meet could be turned into a positive 
outing for future team competitions. 

“Being in Atlanta helped me real-
ize that I have a long way to go in 
terms of improving myself,” Lee said. 
“But that’s good — it gives me some-
thing to work toward.”

Although Lee and senior Chelsea 
Ambort did not escape the general 
pool play, Lipoma made it into direct 

elimination after placing 75th in the 
first round of competition to make 
sure that UCSD women were repre-
sented in the latter rounds.

“We knew that because of how 
many fencers were C-rated and above 
that we were going to be going up 
against some of the top competition in 
the nation,” Lipoma said. “Samantha 
[Rojales] had a bout against an actual 
Olympian, and even though she didn’t 

get any touches in, she still held her 
own. Looking around the room you 
saw the absolute top clubs, coaches 
and names in the fencing world.” 

UCSD will take next week off 
before heading to the Northwestern 
meet on Feb. 2 when NCAA team 
competition will begin again.

On the eve of Spirit Night, the year’s most popular cel-ebration of Triton sports, it 
is essential to take a step back and, 
instead of talking about beloved col-
legiate athletes, look toward the crucial 
sixth man of our school sports teams: 
UCSD students.

Aside from the historically popular 
games throughout the year, like major 
water polo games or the Triton Jam, 

the majority of the UCSD sporting 
events go unwatched, save for players’ 
family members and a select group of 
loyal students, usually fellow Triton 
athletes. Any athlete can attest to the 
boost that a packed house brings to 
a game, and few things in life com-
pare to the unimaginable feeling that 
comes from clinching a crucial win 
and having a throng of fans erupt in 
cheers. Although attendance at sport-
ing events is up a small margin from 
last year, there are still a horrendously 
large number of empty seats at most 
games. The fact that almost 10,000 
students showed up at the polls last year 
to pass the sports referendum but some 
Triton sporting events don’t even get 
10 spectators is ironic, to say the least. 
Why is it that students were willing to 
put time and energy toward approving 
a fee increase but they cannot spare a 
single moment to attend events that are 
the direct beneficiaries of their money?

It will take years for the far-reaching 
goals of the referendum to set in, so in

SWIMMING & DIVING — This 
past weekend was another busy one 
for waterbound Tritons. The women 
led off the weekend on Jan. 18 with 
a home meet against the University 
of San Diego and came away with a 
dominant victory, winning all but 
two swimming events with a final 

score of 176-124. To end the week-
end, the Triton men and women 
traveled to UC Davis on Jan. 20 to 
test their skills against the Division I 
Aggies. The men’s team was compet-
itive, but couldn’t come away with a 
win in the end, losing to the Aggies 
by a slim margin. The men won five 
events total, including both diving

CLUB SPORTS — The UCSD club 
ice hockey team is rolling after a slow 
start, crushing its last two opponents. 
The Tritons faced Loyola Marymount 
University on the road, winning the 
contest 10-4 on Jan. 18 before dominat-
ing University of the Redlands on Jan. 
19 with a 12-3 blowout victory. 

UCSD currently holds an 8-5 record, 
reaching that mark with a rollercoaster 
of an early season. After starting out 
2-0, the Tritons ran into problems, par-
ticularly against San Diego State, losing 
to the Aztecs twice early in the season. 
The Tritons also suffered tough losses 
to UC Davis and UC Irvine, giving the 
Tritons a 5-4 record in the first half of 
their season before winter break. 

UCSD returned after the break 
with intensity, posting a 6-5 win over 
Northern Arizona University on Jan. 12 
before its two wins last weekend. 

“Our game against NAU and past 
two games over the weekend are the 
best hockey that we’ve played,” fresh-
man forward Stephen Lockwood said.

In their second game against 
University of Redlands this season, the 
Tritons posted an easy victory. 

“We played well in the game while 
missing three of our top scorers,” junior 
captain Ken Yamashita said.

UCSD started out strong against 
LMU, scoring four straight goals before 
the Lions could answer back. The 
Tritons led for the entire game, never 
allowing LMU a chance to come back 
in the contest.

“LMU is a Division II team and we 
beat them,” Yamashita said. “The win 
should give us a boost in rankings.”

Junior forward Chris Bachman 
had a team-high four points in 
the game, including a hat-trick. 
Sophomore forwards Kenny 
McCubbins and Michael Frederick 
added three points each. 

Bachman’s return to the team is one 
reason why UCSD has had greater suc-
cess as of late. Bachman came back to 
the team recently after missing the first 
half of the season. 

“Bachman returned from playing 
junior hockey out east,” Yamashita said. 
“He has been one our top-caliber play-
ers since his freshman year.” 

In addition to Bachman’s return, 
the team’s younger members have also 
become more comfortable playing 
with each other, ironing out kinks that 
nagged the team earlier in the season.

“Our team chemistry is great and 
we’re all comfortable with each other,” 
Lockwood said. “We trust each other 
on the ice and have really bonded.”

According to Yamashita, there was 
confusion early in the season because of 
the players’ and coaches’ limited experi-
ence working together, which hindered 
the Tritons in the early games.

“We got a lot of problems and 
confusions straightened out and have 
been able to relax and concentrate,” 
Yamashita said.

While relaxing is important, UCSD 
is now focusing on the postseason.

“Our goals are to get a high seed in 
the playoffs and make [it] into the top 
four teams in our region so that we can 
go to nationals,” Lockwood said.

UCSD will next face UC Irvine on 
Jan. 25. The last time these two teams 
squared off the Tritons took a 7-4 loss 
to the Anteaters on Nov. 30 at Irvine. 
UCSD will follow up that game against 
Fresno State on Jan. 26. 

“We have a debt to settle with Irvine,” 
Yamashita said. “It’s definitely a winna-
ble game. We need to come out strong 
and beat them. We also have a debt to 
settle with Fresno because of last year’s 
hard, physical game against that team. 
We won that game but [Fresno] doesn’t 
respect us as a team.”
