Brown Links Mobility, Freedom Loss 
by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

Gov, Brown gave his San Diego 
audience a classroom lesson 
Friday, in which he linked in-
creased ease in physical mobility 
with loss of individual freedom. 

Speaking at a City Club lucheon 
at the Royal Inn at the Wharf, 
Brown spoke on topics ranging 
from school financing and property 
tax reform to governmental power 
and individual responsibility. 

The governor opened his talk 
before 450 listeners with a list of his 
accomplishments and expectations 
for the coming year. He con-
centrated on his plan to bring 
school financing into compliance 
with the state Supreme Court's 
ruling that educational spending be 
equal throughout California. 

Brown said he has readied a 
plan-to be introduced in the state 
Assembly this week--which 
provides for "substantially equal" 
spending in all school districts. 

The $1.2 billion, five-year plan 
also provides increased spending 
for disabled and bilingual student 
programs and for neighborhood 
councils to plan local educational 
strategies and profidency levels at 
each school, Brown said. 

Brown then launched into a 
rambling, philosophical talk on the 
"larger context" behind current 
developments. 

Referring to the increased 
physical mobility Americans enjoy 
today, Brown said, "As people can 
do what they want-which is the 
democratic principle--their 
obligation to others in society 
decreases. " 

When people leave their 
traditional responsibilities-such 
as to their aged parents-
government is pressured to 
assume those responsibilities, he 
asserted. 

"We're cashing out the family, 
the neighborhood, the church, and 
that ultimately costs money," the 
governor said. "So you shouldn't 
be surprised when your taxes go 

up-that's the cost of this trend .. . 
" We may not be able to change 

the trend, but maybe we can turn it 
a little, temper it humanize it." 

"Less Independence" 
Brown also warned about the 

possible results of this trend. " As 
th state takes on more respon-
sibility, it assumes more power, 
and basic human choices are 
turned over to a central 
bureaucracy, We become less 
independent. .. 

"The challenge of the next 
decade is to decentralize the power 
and revitalize the traditional and 
informal processes of the private 
sector. " 

Brown also took the opportunity 
to defend his choice of state 
agriculture secretary Rose 
Elizabeth Bird as chief justice of 
the California Supreme Court. 

Citing her experience as an 
attorney and goverrunent official, 
Brown said Bird has "the clearest 
mind I've ever seen in govern-
ment." 

In answer to the charge Bird 
should not assume the chief justice 
post because she has no prior 
judicial experience, Brown listed 
several present and former

No Drought Danger in 
SO, City Official Says 

Senator Sees UÂ·S Assist in South Africa Colorado River Strong, But Water 
Conservation Measures are Advised by Dorotby HOUlton 

StaffWrHer 
" We>d like to assist 

di:plomatically and economically 
in seeing a peaceful transfer of 
power from white minorities to 
black majorities in Souto Africa," 
said Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa) 
head of the senate subcommittee 
on Africa. Clark spoke to students, 
professors and military personnel 
at UCSD last Friday about past US 
relations with Africa and current 
policy toward South Africa. 

After joking about the "weather 
shock" he was experiencing, Clark 
started by saying that the de-
colonization in Africa has "not 
been a long process, and that 
" most all of the countries have 
gained independence in the list 
twenty years." He then stated that 
the US has gone through three 
periods of differing relations with 

Africa from l!l57 to the present. 
"From 1957 to 1970 we didn't take 

an enormous interest in Africa," 
said Clark. "In 1965 our interests 
waned with our involvement in the 
Vietnam war." Clark continued to 
say that during this period African 
leaders looked upon the US with 
admiration. 

Relationship Began To Pale 
"This relationship began to pale 

in 1970," said Clark. The senator 
stated that at the time of the early 
Nixon administration and when 
Kissinger was Foreign Affairs 
Advisor for the National Security 
Council, the US feeling was that 
"Whites would be in Africa for 
sure. " 

Clark explained that "policy 
became closer with the white 
regimes in South Africa, Rhodesia 
and with the POJ'tuguese in 
Mozambique." Clark stated that 

A & E Recommendations on 
Schneider go to Coop Tonight 

By Paul Watry 
Staff Writer 
~e Appointments and Evaluations (A&E) conunittee of the Coop had a 

gne.vance hearing last Thursday to detennine whether various charges 
agamst Andy Schneider, External Affairs Coordinator, could be sub-
stantiated or not. 

The charges made against Sclmeider included " non-attendance" of 
~x~e~l Affairs meetings, "conflicts of interest", the discouragement of 
lOdlvlduals coming into the Coop, the incorrect nomination of a student 
regent, and suppression of the Comprehensive Referendum Petition. 

The hearing was primarily scheduled to establish the facts presented to 
t~e Coop's General Assembly. A ruling corresponding to this information 
Will be made by the Coop tonight. A recommendation by A & E will also be 
presented. 

The most serious of these charges, conflict of interest, was leveled by 
Mon~y Reed and Pat Davis. In a letter to A & E, they accused Schneider of 
co~tmu~y "~~iling to identify himseH as a coordinator of the Coop," 
usmg hIS posltlon to run for the AS presidency and voting to reject the 
Comprehensive Referendum Petition. 

Scboelder Couaten Charges 
Schneider countered tbese charges by stating that they were instituted 
~or political redOlII. "I think what we are doing here today is a political 
ISsue. Things like the Comprehensive Referendum Petition are already 
on the ballot. Why bring it up unless it Is a poUticallssue?" 

SUPPOrting Schneider in defense were the Third, Fourth and Muir 
college councils, 88 weD as several key memben of the Coop. In a letter 
to A & E Muir college council termed the charge "ridiculous." It stated 
that "whether Mr. Schneider believed one way or the other on the issues 
we regard as irrelevant. The Council posseaea the power to bind Its 
representatives, and did 10; regardless of Mr. Schneider's personal 
beliefs, he had no choice." 
, I~ ~ reaponeetoanother majorchargetbat Schneider was discouraging 
IOd~vldua1s frem attending and participating in the Coop, Schneider 
clauned that he had always called for coop participation.

the alignment with the Portuguese 
was justified because of the 
struggle with the Soviet Union. 

The senator said that it has now 
been realized that the closeness 
with the white minorities and the 
loosening of relations with the 
black groups was " bad." Accor-
ding to Clark this position resulted 
in an enormous loss of respect for 
the US by the Africans that to this 
day hasn't been lived down, 

Clark said "Our covert in-
volvement with Angola was the 
kiss of death. " 

Noting that "after Angola we 
needed some basic changes in our 
at.titudes and acknowledgecl that 
'the white regimes were not there to 
stay, and that it was our chance for 
a new start." 

Before discussing current US 
diplomacy toward South Africa 
and its existing problems, Clark 
explained what he meant by 
" majority rule," a term he often 
used. He explained that " It is a 
system where people have 
economic, social and political 
rights regardless oftheir race, ' and 
used this example in relation to 
South Africa, what he termed the 
most racist of the African coun-
tries. "South Africa is totally 
segregated," he said. "The people 
have no political rights and in-
creasingly unbelievably op-
pressive laws are being passed." 

"What should our policy be?" 
Clark a bit rhetorically to the 
audience. "Our position toward 
South Africa is yes this is your 
country and you decide what the 
25-26 million of you are going to do, 
but so far as we loan, trade and 
engage in diplomatic exchange, 
that's our business, 'and if you are 
not prepared to negotiate on 
peaceful terms, our policy will be 
cooler." 
Can't Give "MIllions and Mlllions" 

Clark said he "felt confident" 
that South Africa will respond 
favorably to this position. "South 
Africa has a fear of isolation. They 
can't afford to be isolated, and if 
I'm wrong, I still feel its the right 
policy." The senator also added 
that we "can't give millions and 
millions of aid to a society con-
structed like that." 

When questioned about the 
positions of US companies with 
investments in South Africa, Clark 
stated that he expects the c0m-
panies to "work In coordination

Rain dances? Mystical charmes and chants to lure rain clouds? San 
Diego doesn't need them. 

While northern California continues to experience the effects of our 
state's two-year long drought, San Diego is in no immediate danger of 
coping with a similar crisis. 

San Diego depends on the Colorado River for its fresh water. The river, 
at present, has an ample supply of water available for the areas it serves. 

, Roger Graff, Senior Design Engineer for the Water Utilities Service of 
the City of San Diego explained that "The Colorado River is in good shape 
because it has a lot of storage space, such as Lake Mead. The drought will 
have to extend a year or two more before any effect will be felt (in San 
Diego )" 

Because San Diego depends solely on the Colorado River for its water, 
the decision last Wednesday made by the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California (MWD) to temporarily redirect its California water 
allotment for use in Northern California does not affect the city. The 
MWD supplies Los Angeles and Orange counties with water from the 
Colorado River with a small amount of California water mixed in. 

Conservation Endorsed 
Water conservation is still endorsed by the Water Utilities Service. 

Graff recommends an "efficient use of water" by the public. 
Here are some methods he suggested to economize on water use : 
1) Fill dishwasher and clothes washer completely. 
2) Do not run water while brushing your teeth or while shaving 
3) Take short showers 
4) Save the water that is running while you are waiting for the water to 

warm. 
5) Reduce the number of toilet flushes 
According to Bob Miner, Public Relations Consultant of the San Diego 

. Courity Water Authority, 60 percent of wasted water usage occurs outside 
of the home. Miner recommends that the public not use water as a broom 
to clean sidewalks or driveways, avoid overwatering gardens and to cut 
down on car washing as means of conserving water. 

Mandatory water regulation does not appear likely to occur. Enfor-
cement of the regulation seems to be the main problem. 

According to Graff " There is practically no way of regulating water 
except to turn it off. If the water were turned off it would create a health 
hazard. It is up to the consumer's end ofthe pipeline to regulate water."

Argo Pays i eVan 
Dear Resident 01 Arlo Hall: 

I am writing to you in hopes 01 solving a serious problem. For the past 
year and a half, Jim Widener, the Residence Han Manager, and I have 
fougta a losing battle trying to keep the door to the roof of Argo locked. 
Students have destroyed the door and at least a dozen locks on 
numerous occasions, costing the maintenance division a great deal of 
time and money to repair these damages. _ 

The money on repairs translates directly Into higher room rates for 
all students, clearly an intolerable sitJ18tion. The time spent on this 
problem also means !ellS time to respond to other maintenance needs in 
thedonns. 

The roof door must be kept locked for three reasons: 
1. Safety. There is currently no guard rail to block a fan Into the in-

terior of the building-a straight drop of about 70 feet. 
2. Uability. If anyone should get hurt on the roof, the University is 

responsible and could be held liable for damages. 
3. Damage to the roof. There is currently no deck to protect the roof 

from leaks, which could be caused by students walking across the 
gravel covering the roof. The RHB is interested in building a deck for 
sunbathing on the rool, but this would be very expensive and so far no 
definite plans have been made. At any rate, no deck can be c;onstructed 
until a guard rail has been installed surrounding the interior courtyard. 

Last night a brand new lock was broken once again. I have decided 
that this situation requires some drastic action. Therefore, beginning 
today, any damages to the roof door or lock will be deducted from the 
Argo Hall Activities Fund. The damages will be totaled, and each floor 
will pay an equal share. 

I do not like to do this, since I believe that the floor activities money 
should be used to support hall programs. I think this situation has gone 
entirely too far, however, and it is unfair to continue to penalize all the 
students for the actions of an immature few in one building. If you wish 
to discuss this decision with me, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

PHIL KIRCHNER 
Revene Resldeat Dea 

Roof Lock Payment Opposed 
Dear Phil: 

I have just read your letter regarding the damages to the locks on the 
door to the Argo roof. I cannot help but voice adamant disagreement 
with what I feel is a childish and regressive solution to an old problem. 

The reasons you presented to keep the door locked are, at best 
fabricated: â¢ 

1. There has been a guardrail in stock for months. The money spent 
on new locks and repairs should have been spent on its installation long 
ago. 

2. Liability. If a student should get hurt in Czechoslovakia, the health 
insurance would cover it. 

3. The RHB had a workable plan to build a sundeck before last 
summer with a projected cost of $2,500. It could have been built easily 
for under $4.000 had you not squandered it on moving your office from 

go to Blake at a cost of around $12,000. 
You claim that hall money should be spent to support hall programs 

and expect us to believe you are sincere. How can we if you don't sup-
port them (the deck and railing) and even spend student money on your 
own petty comforts and self-perpetuating ends. 

As a member of the Residence Hall Board I must condemn your ac-
tion and support "the immature few in one building" who cannot live 

un~er a stagnant administration.

Dear DOC: There is a sign on Miramar 
Road just west of the intersection with 
Regents Road, right next to the " Property of 
the Regents of the University of California" 
sign, that says "Road Closed." Why is that 
sign there? CODslderlDg the amount of traffic 
on Miramar over 1-5, It bardly leems Sf'.DÂ· 
sible for anyone to pretend the road Is closed. 

The sign is located at the northeast enÂ· 
trance to UCSD. Miramar Road west of there 
is on university property, and only leads into 
the campus. The road stops at the point 
where the center of the campus would have 
been had uam followed its origianal master 
plan and grown to twelve colleges. Officials 
of the campus were concerned that just 
anyone might accidently turn onto Miramar 
Road and find themselves in the heart of the 
University. In order to maintain high 
standards for entrance into UCSD, various 
suggestions were made as to an appropriate 
sign to place on the road to keep unÂ· 
su:;pecUng La Jollans out. Before the present 

was chosen, some of the other 

Trespassing-
Will Be Taught A Lesson, " 

"Danger-iteep Grades Ahead, " and "Dead 
End." 

Dear Doc: Considering the number of 
complaints about UCSD's parking situation, 
why did "they" [whoever the ubiquitous 
" they" actually Is,] put crab grass in the 
area between the Mandeville lot and the 
Eucalyptus grove, rather than expanding the 
lot as they bullt It? Nobody uses that area for 
anything other than stumbling through to the 
health center anyway, so are there any plans 
for paving it over and relle':'tng the 
congestion at Muir's back lot? 

The size of the Mandeville lot was deter-
mined by the money they had to spend on it 
and by the total nwnber of parking spaces 
designed to be available for the expected 
number of parking pennits sold. The crab 
grass is the natural residue from the con-
tractors and construction workers that 
regularly descend upon our campus. At 
present there are no plans for Mandeville 
expansion, however, this summer there are 
plans fo r expanding the P!1rking facilities for 
Revelle, the School of Medicine, and maybe 
Muir if they behave themselves. 

Dear Doc: Why are tbere so many geeks on 
campus? Why do they all sit around in the 
coffee houses talking about Marx wben none 
of them have ever even read Abbie Hoffman? 
Is It true that the Med Scbool grad students 
bold weekly feasts In tbe cadaver vault? Is It. 
true that Marcuse I actually dead and hangs 
from a book in Saul Steirs's closet? How does 
Marco U Mandri comb his balr? Does the 
University have secret tie-Ins with C&R 
clothiers& DO you want to bave a good time? 
If so, call Lance. 

This is national "Send a Geek to College" 
year ... They love Grouco ... No, they moved 
the feasts to a plac,! even more sickening-the 
Revelle cafeteria ... He's not dead ; he is just 
hanging there .. . One strand at a t ime just 
like everyone else .. . Yes ... I'll pass it on. 

Dear Doc : Wbat do you really do?

questions you would like answered to DR.

Fellini's "Casanova" am 

History's Hottest Lover Cooled 
STEVE WOlF & Jilt .ISSMlillR 

IN COORDINATION WITH ICII AJlNQUNC[ ... 
4 

By Paul Watry 
Stiff Writer 

Federico- Fellini's long awaited 
movie, Cal8llova, has finally 
opened in San Diego (at the CoUege 
Theater.) It is sure to be con-
sidered the most significant 
foreign film of the year and con-
sidering Fellini's flamboyancy for 
making headlines this is not sur-
prising. An incredible publicity 
campaign launched in conjunction 
with I)mald Sutherland casted as 
Casa nova, has made it an 
Academy Award nominee after 
only one week's showing in Los 
Angeles_ 

However, despite the fanfare 
accompanying the movie. 
Casanova appears to be a disap-
pointing effort, one not worthy of 
predecessors like Sih and Amar-
cord. A 12-l!Iillion dollar budget, 
the use of the largest production 
unit in Italy, and Fellini's 
reputation has made this disap-
pointment even greater_ Still in a 
year dominated by unoriginal 
efforts and remakes, Casanova 
turns out to be at least an in-
teresting failure; one not due to an 
overworn cliche. 

Fellini has said that Casanova 
was a film which he had to get out 
of his system. "It started as a love-
hate affair three years ago when 
we first began to project. Now it's _ 
mostly just hate. Casanova was not 
a 'Latin Lover' and I set out to 
destroy him." 

And destroy him, he does. Felini 
has left nothing to the imÂ· 
magiriation _ Casanova is not the 
Latin Lover or the romantic legend 
that we know, but a love machine : 
waxen, cold and inhwnan. 

Getting the women in bed is no 
problem; Casanova uses the same 
line ("You're the only one I have 
ever loved") over and over again_ 
Once 'in bed, the only mutual 
respect between Casanova and his 
lover comes under the category of 
perfonnance, In the ultimate 
debasement, Casanova eventually 
participates in an hour long 
"contest" to prove his sexual 

Donald Sutherland as Fel lini'scold-
bluoded "Casanova." 
superiority over other men. 

Donald Sutherland's per-
formance as Casanova is helped by 
the brilliancy of makeup man De 
Rossi, who transforms his face into 
a startling likeness of Casanova's 
single portrait. Unfortunately, a 
great deal of the effectiveness that 
Sutherland might have had as an 
actor is washed away by Fellini's 
over-dominating direction . 

Fellini is actually the star of the 
movie, not Sutherland, and he 
never lets us forget it. Sutherland 
is not so much an actor in this 
movie, as he is an extension of 
Felini's directing arm. His per-
formance as Casanova is not 
distinctive at all because he is not 
playing a person, only a vehicle for 
an idea imposed by Felini. 

And this is the flaw of Casanova. 
It elevates and oversta tes this idea 
with as much subtlety and grace as 

The film revolves around this 
revelation through a series of 
bizarre bedroom scenes, where 
Casanova demonstrates his 
originality in sexual . prowess. 
Casanova takes on all manner of 
women; countesses, mystics and 
giantesses. Finally, he "makes it" 
with a life-size mechanical doll, 
thereby completing a cycle 
wherein only the physical remains. 

Casanova's performance in bed' 
realizes the point of the movie_ To 
him, sex is an art form, something 
purely physical and he performs it 
with aU the finesse of a gymnast 
tuning up for the Olympic games. 

an elephant walking on rice-paper. 
Casanova as a lover becomes 
overtly disgusting, and it seems 
that Fellini is too preoccupied with _ 
this in itself_ After all, it can be 
remembered that Casanova was a 
philosopher, diplomat and scientist 
as well as a lover. Though this is 
briefly alluded to at the beginning 
and end to show the ironic nature of

ANNOUNCEMENT 

During Spring Quarter 
. '977 tha Department 
of Economics will be 
offering 2 lower 
dlvlalon courses not 
previously announced, 

ECONOMics 1 B will be repeated Spring 
Quarter . Students currently taking 1 A who d id not 
tak e 18 in the Fall ca n c omplete the Economics 1 
sequence 'ilis Sprin g by taking bo th 1 B an d 1 C 
slmultaneously_ Although 1 C normally requires 18 
as prerequisite , tBking the two courses 
simultaneously w i ll be suffic ient this t ime o n ly . 
(1A rem ains a prerequisite to 1C, however .) The 
in s truc tor for 18 w ill b e Professor Ramanathan. 
and the lec tures w i ll meet Tuesday and Thurs day , 
9 :30 - 10:50a .m . 

ECONOMics 4 A new course entit led 
"Introduction to Management & Accounting" , w ill 
also be offered in the Spring . Th is course w ill treat 
the concept of Â· management and its functions , 
with emphasis given to accounting as the basic 
information system of organizations . Topics t.o be 
covered include : marketing. production , f inance, 
basic accounting concepts , and the construction 
and analysis of the two fundamental financ ial 
statements, the Profit -and loss Statement, and 
the 8alance Sheet . 

Economics 4 has become a lower d iv ision 
prerequisite for the management science major, 
but it is not a prerequisite for the economics 
major . 

Beginning next year, Economics 4 will become 
a prerequiste for the upper division Bccounting 
course , Economics 173. Thus, students intending 
to take 173 in the Spring Quarter of 1978 should 
take Economics 4 this coming quarter . 

Taking Economics 4 does not earn credit 
toward the upper division requirements of either 
the economics or management science majors . 

There is some talk of stabl! h1nn /'I buslne!l 
minor for Third and Fourth College students . 
The outcome of these discussions is uncertain , at 
best. But if the business minor does even '.! fB , 
Economics 4 would almost cert inly be a required 
component of such B minor. 

Economics 4 will be taught thiS Spring by Ms. 
Ellen Cook and the lectur s will meet Tuesday and 
Thursday, 2 :30 - 3 :50 p .m .
