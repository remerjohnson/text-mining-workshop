Ganezer said that the 
problems had " nothing to do

,,-:------------- - ·Special Report:. Research-
Curiosity Lures Faculty 
To Boldly Go Where ... 
Over $100 million is spent 

annually at UCSD by researchers 
pursuing the unknowns, attempting 
to fill in the gaps in the 
contemporary collection of 
knowledge. According to Dr. David 
Wong, chairman of the Physics 
Department , research occupies 
about 50 percent of a professor's 
time - possibly more if he is still 
workin.,: to gain tenure. 

This report looks into some of the 
many issues related to fa ulty 
re~arch: sources and allocation of 
funding, topics of researc h, 
attitudes of some department 
chairmen towards research, and 
the use of recombinant DNA in 
genetic ;esearch projects. 

By Dou, Campion 
Science Edllor 

Pornography, alcoholism , 
bioluminescence, sub-atomic 
particles and even mountain 
climbing are the subjects of 

intensive study and exploration 
by the faculty members at 
UCSD. In spite of this diversity 
of research interests, though 
departments within both 
natural sciences and social 
sciences have similar philos~ 
phies regarding much of the 
inv~tigation carried out by 
professors here. 

Most professors decide upon 
their research topics as a result 
of what might be labeled 
"academic curiosity." A 
Physics Department Chairman 
David Wong explained, "In 
physics, one addresses the 
unknowns. You find that 
certain knowledge is lacking in 
certain fields and you pursue 
that field to fill in the 
knowledge. That's the primary 
motivating force." 

While this motivation is 
predominant in many fields, it 
is not the only reason behind a 

professor's choice·of his or her 
field of inquiry. According to 
the chairman of the Depart-
ment' of Biology, Daniel 
Lindsley , there are some 
professors who are not working 
to fill in the gaps of knowledge 
mentioned by Wong , but 
instead are attempting to refine 
a specific research technique. 
Lindsley cited as an example 
his own work with fruit We and 
his efforts to gain further 
understanding of genetic 
through that research. 

"Some people are very 
problem -oriented, " said 
Lindsley. "I think those are the 
most successful biologists. 
They will choose their material 
to solve that problem. Other 
people are material-oriented -
I happen to be one of those. " 

Wong identified sUIl a third

Affirmative Action Tested 
Weber Case Could Stop Union Push for Minorities 

By Mark FrIedman 
The case of Weber VI. Kalter 

Alumlnlllll aad Uniled S&eel-
workers of America, now 
before the Supreme Court, is 
shapiDi up as the biUest court 
battle yet over equal job rights 
for Blacks, other minorities 
and women. 

In response to the growing 
controversy surrounding the 
case, a number of San Diego 
organizations and unionists 
have coalesced under the 
umbrella of the Labor/ 
Community AlfirmativeAction 
Task Force. Their goal is to 
mobilize opposition to a 
Federal Appeals court decision 
in the case. 
Mark Friedman is a member of the 
International Association of 
Machinists, Local 685 and a 
member of the Affirmative Action 
Task Force. 

Among the groups invol ved in 
this effort are the San Diego 
chapters of the National 
Organization for Women, the 
Coalition of Labor Union 
Women, the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of 
Colored People, the Urban 
League , as well as the 
Southeast Ministerial Alliance. 

Member and officials of more 
than 3G local unions in the area 
are also part of the effort . 

The initiative for this effort 
came from members of Local 
885 of the International 
Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace workers (lAM). 

The unionists and others 
believe the Weber Decision 
poses a serious threat to 
affirmative action programs 
that have been or are being 
established in San Diego to 
achieve equal opportunity in 
hirlng and promotion in 
industrial jobs. 

The lAM, which is the large t 
union in the city. has negotiated 
several hiring and upgrading 
programs. The aerospace and 
machine industries are heavily 
dependent on government 
contracts. [f Weber's case were 
to be upheld by the Supreme 
Court it would nullify 
Executive Order 11246, the 
strongest affirmative action 
order ever issued by the 
Federal Government. This 
order mandates equal op-
portunity programs where 
federal contracts are involved. 

An article in "685 News" 
points out that the Weber case

" chailenges the right of unions 
to negotiate affirmative action 
programs to overcome 
employer discrimination in 
hiring and advancement. " 

At issue in the case is an on-
the-job training program for 
skilled jobs at Kaiser 
Aluminum. The program was 
negotiated by the United Steel 
Workers Union and covers all 
Kaiser plants. 

Under the pla n, half of all 
trainee positions would go to 
minorities or women until a 
goal was reached based on the 
proportion of minority workers 
in the area of each plant. 
Kaiser's Gramercy, Louisiana 
plant had one of the highest 
goals - 39 percent. Atall plants 
the goal for women is 5 percent 
oC the skilled jobs . 

Brian Weber, a white male 
worker at Kaiser Gramercy, 
sued to overturn the plan. He 
sa id it was " reverse dis-
crimination." (It should be 
noted that prior to the 
negotiation of this plan, Kaiser 
had no upgrading program for 
any workers. The plan made an 
upgrading program available 
to white males as well as 
minorities and women for the 
first time.) . 

The local courts in Louisiana 
ruled in favor of Weber, but the 
case has been appealed by both 
Kaiser and the United Steel-
workers Union. If upheld by the 
Supreme Court, the Weber 
decision would be a devastating 
blow to equal rights for Blacks 
and women in industry. It 
would prohibit unions from 
negotiating affirmative action 
plans. 

Nationally the union move-
ment and civil rights organiza-
tions have taken the lead in 
organizing opposition to the 
Weber Decision. They have 
recognized the importance of 
affirmative action programs 
and the use of quotas to make 
up for years of racist and sexist 
discrimination. For example, 
the median income of Black 
and Latino families is only 66 
percent of white familles . 

To galvanhe further 
opposition to the Weber · 
Decision , the Laborl 
Commuruty Affirmative Action 
Task Force is sponsoring a 
speak-out in Balboa Park at 
6th and Laurel Streets on 
Sunday, April 29 at 1: 00pm.

Law of Hierarchies 

Bumblers Just 1 
Level Too High 

By Eric Harpell 
In spite of abundant and 

often abu s ive criticism 
directed at UCSD staff and 
Administration of late , there 
exists strong , although 
inconspicuous reason why no 
guilt should be placed on any 
university personnel. Al-
though it cannot be denied 
that incompetence does run 
unchecked among the keepers 
of justice and order within the 
university, such criticism is 
certainly unfair. Staff and 
administrative personnel are 
merely obeying The Law Of 
Administrative Dynamics , 
and are not responsible for 
their own incompetence. 
Deflnilion 1 The Law Of 
Administrative Dynamics 

In any h'ierarchical 
organization , such as 
Universities , Governments or 
Corporations, an employee 
will receive promotions to 
succeedingly higher positions 
as long as he remains 
competent at each one. 
Promotions will end when the 
employee is promoted to a 
position in which he is no 
longer cQmpetent. He will 
have reached his Level of In-
competence and will remain 
there. 
Axiom 1.1 The organization-
climber who has reached the 
end of hi s rope will not be 
fired, He ha proven himself a 
worthy employee in other 
positions. 
Axiom 1.2 Th e le vel of 
incompetence may not be 
rea ched until the employee is 
promoted to ·the very apex of 
the organization. There, the 
level of incompetence is 
always attained . Board 
chairmen , United States 
presidents, and chancellors 
serve to illustrate this 
proposition . 

To illustrate how the Law Of 
Administrative Dynamics 
works, let us examine the 
careers of two adminis-
trators: Esther Prin, the 
director of the registrar's 
office at Idi Amin University 
in Cucamonga. California, 
and Stanley Nebulous , Ph.D. 
in philosophy and Dean of 
Elp.venth College at IAU . 

Esther Prin entered the 
university hierarchy as a 
clerk in the registrar 's office. 
Prin immediately displayed 
her proficiency at typing and 
filing . Prin was, indisputably, 
the world 's most proficient 
typist and filer. Having 
proved herself worthy at this 
bottom-level position, she was 
promoted to the next 
succeeding position, having to 
punch buttons on a computer 
corresponding to the letters 
written on a registration card. 
As this job bore a striking 
resemblance to typing, Prin's 
natural ability earned her 
promotion to the next 
succeeding level within the 
department. Since the 
rettitrar 's office was not a 
particularly complex organi-
zation at IAU, the next level 
was director of the registrar's 
office. This job entailed no 
typing , no filing , only 

a nswering question from 
students , including, " Why 
am I dropped from all my 
c lasses?" a nd decision 
making, such as : Whether or 
not to assign three art classes 
to a chern major because the 
chemistry classes are full. 

Clearly tasks of this sort may 
abridge the capabilities of 
even the nastiest typi t and 
file sorter. Prin , having 
devoted the majority of her 
adult life to typing a nd file 
sorting, displayed no ability in 
this new position. She had 
reach e d h e r l eve l of 
incompetence and therefore 
wa ineligible for promotion. 
Es ther Prin remained the 
in co mpetent head of the 
Regi. tra r 's office' for twenty-
five years until her manda-
tory reti rement at age sixty-
Cive. 
Eric Horpel/ is a Muir Freshman 
and staff writer for Tile 
Guardian. 

Stanley Nebulous entered 
the University Hiera rchy as 
an associate professor . 
Having proved himself 
worthy in the succeeding 
stages of professordom, he 
was promoted, first to 
department chairman, then to 
assistant dean (where he 
merely served as dean in the 
dean's absence, which was 
never) , then to Dean . Poor 
professor! Having spent the 
majority of his adult life 
studying and revering the 
great philosophers, and 
reveling in the joys of 
syllogistic logic, he was thrust 
into a position of handling 
Caculty and student needs and 
budget consi~ ations . 
Professor Nebulous had no 
experience and consequently 
no competence in this new 
field . He had reached his level 
of incompetence and would 
remain there . Stanley 
Nebulous served as dean until 
his untimely death in 1974 
when a student, enraged 
because he couldn't pay his 
fees until he picked up his 
finanCial aid check, and 
couldn't pick up his check 
until he paid his fees, stabbed 
him with a letter opener. 

As with Dean Nebulous and 
department director Prin, 
once an employee shows that 
he is good at his job, he is 
promoted . Promotions end 
when one reaches a position in 
which he is no longer capable.

Democracy in Ecuador 

QUITO. Ecuador (AP) - Ecuadorians will end 
their military dictatorship Sunday by electing a 
president and congress, becoming only the third 
country in South America to be ruled by a civilian 
democracy. 

The country, plagued with politicai instability in 
recent years, has been under military rule since 
February 1972. 

The new president and 69 members of the national 
legislature elected Sunday are to be inaugurated 
along with a new constitution on Aug. 10. 

The election has more than local significance. 
Civilian democracy is rare in military-dominated 
South America, existing only in Venezuela and 
Colombia . Two of Ecuador's Andean neighbol-s, Peru 
and noli via , are ruled by military dictatorships which 
also have promised a return to constitutional 
government. 

The administration of President ~rtel' has voiced 
support for the transfer of power.

WASHINGTON (AP) ....:.. Consumer prices soared 

another 1 percent in March, the government said 
yesterday, adding to concern that inflation in the 
economy is out of control. 

The annual rate of price increases during the first 
three months of the year was 13 percent, the worst 
quarterly burst in inflation in 41h years. Consumer 
prices increased 1.2 percent in February. 

Prices increased sharply in March in all sectors of 
the economy. Food and housing prices were up 1 
percent; clothing prices were up 1.5 percent, and 
transportation costs rose 1.2 percent. 

The price of regular gasoline rose 3.8 percent to a 
record 70.6 cents a gallon in March, up from 68 .1 cents 
in February and the largest monthly percentage 
increase since July of 1975. 

Rationing Advances 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Energy 

Committee breathed new life into President Carter's 
standby gasoline 'plan yesterday . but only after the 
administration promised to alleviate potential 
gasoline shortages in states where people do the most

The committee voted 9-8 to recommend approval of 
the plan to the full Senate. . 

As late as Wednesday night, key members of the 
panel had predicted the rationing scheme would be 
rejected. '

More School Money 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The Senate, shrugging off 
warnings of a tax increase and disaster in the 
teachers' pension system, approved a $950 million bill 
yesterday that provides 9 percent annual increases in 
state school support. 

The bill , SB 234 by Sen. Ralph Dills, 'D-Gardena, 
backed by the powerful education lobby, was sent to 
the Assembly on a 27-6 vote, the exact two-thirds 
majority needed. . 

In the Assembly, it will face pressure from Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr .. among others, to cut its overall 
size, and from liberal urban legislators to restore 
Senate cuts in the expansion of some special school 
programs. 

UFW Boycotts Lettuce 
SALINAS (AP) - United Farmworkers union 

president Cesar Chavez officially called {or a 
nationwide boycott of lettuce yesterday. 

Speaking at a press conference after testifying

would be " the only way to get justice." 

Chavez announced plans for the boycott last month. 
He already has called for a boycott against United

Asked if he intended for the boycott to begin 
yesterday, Chavez answered, "right."

SACRAMENTO (AP) - An attempt to scuttle a bill 

calling a special election Nov. 6 on busl,ng and

After nearly eight hours of maneuvering and vote

With their unJlefeated league

only team in their league left to

the end, after all fifteen scoring 
ma tches had been completed 
and the score 11-4, it was 
obvious that UCSD domination 
of the league continued. 

Three win Weeps in mixed

for the evening. Mark Standlee 
and Lan Ta teamed up in the 

- number one mixed doubles spot 
to lead the rout, a ided with wins

Errors Dump Triton 
Nine Again, 7 - 4 

By Jon Halperin 
In a manner which is 

becoming all too common, the 
Triton baseball team snapped 
another game from the jaws oC 
victory Tuesday nigth. Starting 
pitcher Tom Schwartz pitched 
well enough to win, but once 
again it was three Triton errors 
in a ddition to a possible 
coaching miscalculation that 
cost the team a win . 

In the first inning , the Point 
Loma Co llege Crusl1ders 
scored two runs, courte~yof an 
erro r by s hort stoj) Rob 
Gramme. 

Pat McGovern followed with 
a single that scored Moffat. 
With runners now at first and 
third and one out, Vince Askey 
ordered batter Marc Sharpe to 
try a squeeze play . The call 
backfired, as Sharpe popped up 
into a double play, ending the 
rally one run short.

Sports An~ouncements 

With two out in the top of the 
seventh inning and a runner on 
second base, Gramme again 
was the culprit; bobbling a 
groundball hit to the hole at 
short. The Crusaders jumped 
on the demoralized Schwartz 
for four runs (all unearned) and 
led the game at that point, 6-4. 
In the top of the eighth the 
Crusaders added one more run 
against Steve Robertson to 
make the score 7-4 . 

Mary Egan, a basketball 
player during the winter, was 
having similar luck in her beat 
event, the shot put. Egan's 36 
foot shot put set a new school 
record a nd captured fourth 
place among the other 
Riverside competitors. 

Frisbee Golf 
By a severe oversight on the 

part of the sports department of 
the Guardian, the winners of 
the best ball portion oC last 
weekend 's Frisbee Golf 
tournament were omitted from 
Wednesday's story. Indeed, it is 
only correct that these fearless 
throwers get recognition also. 
John Migliore and Scott Wilson 
·teamed up to win the best ball 
title with a combined score of 
234 tying with Mark Hauser, the 
tournament's overall winner, 

and Greg Smith. Smith and 
Hauser lost the title in the 
second hole of sudden death 
when their opponents got an 
eagle.

FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM 
NOW OPEN 

Q 
The President's Undergraduate Fellowship 
Program Competition for 1979-80 is now 
open. This competition has grown in 
popularity among UC San Diego students 
since its inception in 1967, The program is 
designed to assist unusually talented 
undergraduate students to carry out special 
studies and projects under faculty 
supervision during term time andlor 
vacation. Such projects may include 

research and/or other creative activities. 

Another fellowship has been added to the 
competitio.n, in the name of David Jay 
Gambee. David was a Revelle student who 
was killed in a traffic accident just prior to the 
1978-79 academic year. The fellowship, 
established in memory of David, will be 
a warded with preference to a student doing a 
project in an area in which David was 
interested, namely, naturalists study in 

Yosemite, student government, or music. 

Fellowship applications are available in

Mr. Plteon (left) and the Psycholoey operant conditioning lab cooperate to unravel the laws of learning. 

Reasons for Research Vary 
(Condlllled from pale I) 
claasilied thOle who seek to. 
solve a specific social problem 
as bein, "mission-oriented," 
sayinr that this type of person 
is more common today than 
several years a,o. 

"We're distinguishing 
(workinr to fill) a lack of 
knowledre on one hand and a 
Deed to solve certain problems 
on the other hand," he said. 

Currently, ac.cording to 
Won" research in the field of 
nuclear fusion is often 
specifically directed toward 
solvinr the energy problem. 
"There's also a lack of 
knowledge there," he ad-
mitted "but some of the ... 
motivatinr force is driven by 
need." 

In sociology, too, wbile much 
of the research is academic in 
nature and often "abstract," 
according to department 
chairman Dr. Dennett Derger, 
"Some of the research is highly 
practical and oriented toward 
solving pressing social Issues. " 

The same is true of a great 
deal of the work done by the 
faculty of the Psychology 
Department. For example, 
so,me of the research done on 
alcoholism might eventually 
lead to an effective treatment 
of that problem, according to 
Psychology Department 
Chairman George Reynolds. 

"Some of the work ... that 
concerns reading and diffi-
culties in reading," added 
Reynolds, "--that could have

some practical applications. In 
general, anything that's done 
could be applied practically at 
some point in the future, either 
by itself or in combination with 
other work. " 

In all cases it is the professor 
who decides on his own 
research topic. Although, as 
indicated by Lindsley , the 
choice often depends on "the 
environment. " That is, the 
areas in which a person's 
colleagues are concentrating 
many times will inIluence the 
field he chooses. 

In addition, the structure and 
needs of a department may be 
determining factors of what 
research is done. This is 
especially true when a 
de rtment has reached a 

"steady state" in its 
development; when the faculty 
is composed of the desired 
number of professors. At that 
point the department usually 
makes some effort to maintain 
a balance between the fields of 
expertise of retiring professors 
and those of newly-hired 
faculty. 

With a faculty of '22, the 
Department of Sociology "is 
just about at what we call a 
steady state," according to 
Berger. 

" The department regards 
itself as having three major 
focuses of concentration," said 
Berger. " One of those is what 
we call micro-sociology ." 
Researchers in this division

face-to-face interactions. Most 
of the information gathering in 
micro-sociology is done in the 
field , s tudying real conver-
sation between people. rather 
than in thesetting of a sociology 
laboratory. 

"Secondly i a genera l area 
which we call " historiral -
a n a lyti cal' sociology ,': 
fierger continued. In this field 
are those professors who study 
institutions, such as govern-
ments, and their effects on 
society . 

The third general area, the 
sociology of culture, deals with 
the evolving of sub-cultures and 
what Berger called "cultut"a l 
moods." 

While UCSD' Biolog y 
Dep a rtment concentrate s 
somewhat henvily on biology nt 
the cellular and molecular 
levels, Lind ley indicated tha t. 
like Sociology, it does " have 
strengths in three general 
areas. One is in neurobiology -
we have a good , strong group of 
neurophy siologists and 
neurobiologists." Professors in 
this field study the anatomy 
and physiology of the nervou 
system. 

Another group. consisting of 
a " nuc leus" of five people, 
studies population·biology . This 
research involves following 
and tabulating demographics 
- density and bala nce of 
populations - and so requires 
some field work. 

Almost all of the molecular 
biology and neurobiology work 
is conducted in the laboratory. 

While the physicists here 
direct research on many 
different subjects - astrono-
my , plasma physics, geo-
physics" nuclear physics and 
solid state physics, for example 
- Wong chose to divide the 
work done in his department 
along more Cundamentallines. 
He said that about half of the 35 
faculty members in Physics 
are " experimentalists" and 
half are " theorists." 

" They complement each 
other but the theorists don 't do 
lab experiments," said Wong. 
He continued , " It is the 
theori sf s role _ to hypothesize 
(to develop a model) and test it 
out by solving problems within 
that model and compare results 
to experimental observation."

for over half a century. Since 
his deatli in 1968, reo 
examination of the French-
man '. limited but highly 

influential oeuvre have 
continued to appear, The latest 
oC these, Octavio paz's Marcel

focuses with exhaustive detail 
upon Duchamp's major 
creations -The Bride Slripped 
Bare By Her Bachelors, Even

The Illuminating Gas. 

Summarizing Duchamp's 
entire career is impossible

mentioned that Duchamp's 
creation (often no more than 
cryptic notes inscribed on 
common household objects) 
possess a wry satirical humor 
and irreverence . One of 
Duchamp's more famous early 
" works" is a reproduction of 
the Mona Lisa to which he 
added a mocking goatee and 
moustache. 

In his study Paz joins such 
famous critics as Andre Breton 
and Arturo Schwarz in 
attempting to unravel the 
mystery behind Bride (also 
known as the Large Glass) and

of sweeping statements about

with implication as T.S. Eliot's 
The Waste Land. 

The Large Glass , begun by 
Duchamp in 1915 and officially 

, left incomplete in 1925, is 
evaluated by Paz in terms of its 
reference s to classical 
mythology, Neoplatonist logic 
and radicaltheorie of phy ics. 
A schematic painting on two 
sheets of glass, depicting the 
"bride" above and the 
" bachelors" below, Paz sees 
this piece as both a satire upon 
the sexual mechanization of 
modern man (notes leCt by 
Duchamp refer to the bride as

Music/.Guy Messengu. 

Minister of Bluegrass 
T he Earl Scruggs Revue . stopped by the Backdoor Tuesday night for t'NO 
shows that left everyone 
smiling . Although my ex-
perience with bluegrass l 
country styles is limited, I 
jumped a t th e c ha nce to 
intervi ew Scruggs,. w ho is a 
legend a mong banjo pickers 
and bluegrass pl aye r 
everywhere. 

My visions of a bearded 
hillbilly in overalls with a 
battered banjo on hi knee 
dissolved the moment I la id 
eyes on Scruggs in , the 
performers ' cubicle . - Some-
thing was immediately c lear 
though puzzling to me: " Earl 
Scruggs is a mini ter?' " An 
un ettling thought. to be s ure. 
The King of Bluegra s banjosat 
qui lly in a pa dded chair. legs 
c rossed a nd hea d s lightly 
bowed contemplati vely. He 
wore a ni ce ly pr e e d 
conservative su it , polished 
shoes a nd a colorful tie . Hi ha ir 
wa impeccably combed in the 
style of m any of my dad's 
friends . This docile looking 
man 's appearance resembled 
the grooming and attire of a 
clergyman . His manner, as 
well, fit the bill. Wben he spoke 
Scruggs mu se d quietly , 
thoughtfully , never using 
extravagant expressions or 
gestures, methodically pausing 
in mid-sentence to gather his 
thoughts , occasionally 
cracking a calm country smile . 

my every word and occa-
ionally har hly interrupting 

Scruggs to se t something 
straight. Her job. a pparently , 
was to make certa in I didn't 
become noisy or boorish in the 
cool aura of Scruggs ' soothing 
reverie. 

I became curious a bout 
Scruggs' background : 

" I was born in North Carolina 
n nd I started play in ' banjo 
mostly for com munity get-
togethers, square dances .. . then 
began working professionally 
in 1945 .... " 

" What so rt of music do you 
listen to? " 

" Anything, if it 's done well. 
My son and I Ii len to just 
about any kind of music." 

Without bet raying his oft-
s poken manner with any hint of 
pride. Scrugg added . " My 
sons ma ke up mo t of the band 
right now . Randy , the oldest. 
has played on every a lbum of 
min since he was 13" (He 
plays guitar a nd fiddle) . " Ga ry 
plays th e harp and sings : Steve, 
the you ngest , pla ys key-
boards. " 

"Are yo u worried about the 
rapidly - nowballing co m -
mercialism in music today ? Is 
something going to ' na p '?" 

" I'd like to know , too! " he 
chuckled softly . "I think things 
change, they work out, things 
a re going one way , then 
someone writes a ballad or 
something .. . change will 
happen." . 

" Yes . I worked with him," 
answered Scruggs. . 

" He played on a n a lbum," 
snapped the lady across the 
room. 

" I enjoyed working with . 
him." 

"A re you Camiliar with Jerry 
Garcia ?" 

" Yes." 
(Scruggs doeSil' t w<Jste 

words.) 
Although he is not comical , it 

i <Jmusing to see Scruggs stand' 
fixed and de<Jdpan at midstage 
flanked 'by his long-haired, 
denim-clad - son . The cene 
resembled a billboard about the 
generation gap , but the music 
ha no gap - the sound is hot. 
The versatility of the band is its 
t.rongest point. At one point in 

the concert Gary laid down a 
h avy McCal'lney-styl e line 
while Dad whipp d out some 
nn ty rock a nd roll riffs on the 
b.mjo on a tune which m <J de the 
au d ience st ir - " LLIdy 
Madonna." You could ee he 
got of[ on it - he loved il! ! 

Co untry rock tunes were 
interspersed with bluegrass 
cIa s ics like 00 Foggy Mountain 
Breakdown . " Th e ampli-
fic<lt ion for a ll the players was 
excellent: Scrugg ' banjo in 
p<lrlicular just loud. enough to 
match the electric power of his 
on . axes . 
Earlier I had asked Scruggs 

what advice did he have Cor 
young musicians in dealing 
with competition. 

The Earl Scruggs Revue performed Tuesday nighl at San Diego 
Stale's Backdoor. 

A woman, presumably 
Scruggs' wife sat across the 
room with a scolding look, 
glaring at me with narrowed 
eyes and pursed lips, tuned in to 

I asked him about his use of 
c.ontemporary rock and roll 
musicians on his a lbums .. . 
"Didn 't you play with Alvin 
Lee?" 

His answer was <IS beauti-
fully simplistic as the rest... 
" Just keep ... keep punchin' at 
it ......

Sh~kespeare Plays • the Wasteland In 
I n 1975, when producer Cedric Messina first suggested that the 

BBC do all 37 of Shakespe.are's 
playa, be met with skeptlcalsilence. Yet 
Messina's idea has become a reality 
and this year marks the first season of 
the most ambitious TV series ever -
Tbe Sbakespeare Plays . Tbe 
Shakespeare Plays will offer six plays 
each year for the next six years, and the 
Cine if rather conventional productions 
of this season are a hopefp l sign 0 
what's to come. 

Each play; costing about $250,000 
(less than one episode of Cbarlle's 
Anlela), is done individually so that 
directors and actors aa well as quality 
will vary with each show. The best 
programs of this season have been 
Ricbard II, Measure for Measure and 
AI Yoa Like It. JuU .. Caesar and 
Romeo and Julie&, however, have 
proved less than satisfying. 

Rlcbard II well suits the small screen 
because It is a static play that does not 
require vast expanses Cor its action. -Yet 
the heavily symbolic language and the 
abundance oC ritudls may turn off the 
average TV viewer. However , this 
production with its outstanding cast 
proves quite successful. Capturing 
Richard 's theatricality, Derek J acobi 
beautifully delivers Shakespeare's 
poetic speeches. Jacobi also does 3 fine 
job conveying the subtle changes of a 
man who becomes more dignified and 
sympathetic after he loses his crown . 

Measure for Measure, another fine 
play this season. is one of Shakespeare's 
rarely performed problem comedies. 
Measure for Measure is a fascinating 
and remar~ably contemporary play 
which deals with morality , the law and 

women ' attitudes. The pl ay centers 
a round the opposition of the lustful 
Angelo and the virtuou s Isabelle 
(beautifully played by Kate Nelligan) . 
The adroit staging of the confrontations 
between these two c haracters makes 
this play a success. Additionally, 
Measure for Measure is a dark play 
which depicts the nether side of life, and 
this proauction, especially in the prison 
sce ne s, capt ures this mood . 
Highlighting this da rkness, though, is 
the delightfully comical performance of 
John McEnery as Lucio. 

As You Like It (which was , ironically , 
filmed at G1amis Castle where the real 
Macbeth lived) is a nother well -
pe rformed pl ay . Despite a sti lted 

. opening, this As Vou Like It delivers a 
joyous outing into the idyllic forest of 
Arden. When the play shifts to the forest 
the cast, most notably Helen Mirren a 
Rosiland, improve tremendously . Once 
In the forest Shakespeare's magic takes 
over a nd As Vou Like It proves hard to 
resist. 

On the negative side of the season 
stand the bland' renditions of Julius 

. Caesar and Romeo and Juliet . Julius 
Caesar, although it picked up towards 
th e end, is slow-moving and uninspired. 
Richard Pasco makes the mistake of 
playing Brutus as morose rather than 
refl ective, and Charles Gray's Caesar 
comes across as a total fool who seem 
incapable of commanding anyone's 
respect. Al tho ugh Shakespeare 
portrays a foolish Caesar, the director 
shou ld counterbalance some of 
Caesar's weaknesses by casting a 
dignified actor in the role or else 
Antony 's devotion to him a nd Cassius ' 
fear of him will seem unjustiCied.

The greatest disapPoi ntment of the 
season turned out to be Romeo and 
Juliet. This play was severely hindered 
by one of the most boring portrayals of 
Romeo ever recorded. Patrick Ryecart 
as Romeo wa bland and thoroughly 
unbelieva ble as a passionate youth . 
Rebecca Saire as Juliet fared better. 
but the production just failed to capture 
the beauty , pass ion and tragedy 
inherent in the play . 

The common flaw that these plays 
shared was conventionality: none of the 
directors seemed willing to take a risk 
or instill the play with a fresh vitality..: In 
productions such as Roman Polanski 's 

Maelwth . Joseph Papp's Much Ado 
AboUl Nothing a nd Franco Zeffirelli 's 
Romeo and Juliet the directors take 
c hances with their interpretations a nd 
c reate more lively films . The BBC 
seems too ready to settl e for mere 
re c itations of the plays . but 
Shakespeare 's dialogue is so beautiful 
a nd compelling that even this can 
captivate an a udience. 

Yet despite the co n ve nti on al 
approach of the BBC, The Shakespeare 
Plays a re a commendable success 
worthy of attention. The last play of the 
season , Henr y VIII , airs this 
Sunday at I.

Faculty Research 
(COlli inu.' lI t't'UIll palW II) 

Because the tr a ining 
necessary for each of these 
type of work is 0 different, 
a ccording to Wong , this 
experimenta l/ theoretical divi-
sion is a fairly strict one . 

In a ddition to those 
professors whose re sea rch 
concentrates on information 
processing a nd animal learning 
and motivation, the Psychology 
Department has what Reynolds 
called "sub tantial groups" in 
social psychology (the study oC 
group and their effect on 
indivi dua l s) a nd develop-
mental psychology. He added, 
" We have a pretty good 
representation in ... sensory in 
general, vision in particular, 
a nd quite a bit of physiological 
work going on - hunger 
sa tiation and how that comes 
a bout. " 

Reynolds went on to say, 
" There's a fair bit of joint 
research that goes on within the 
Psychology Department - two 
or three p syc hologists 
interested in the same problem 
working on it together and 
publi hing a paper with a ll 
those people as a uthors. " 

This type of interaction also 
occ u rs in Physics where , 
according to Wong , about 30 

percent of the professors are 
working in "some ort of a 
colla boration" .at any given 
time. 

Whil some joint re earch 
does ha ppen ill the SociolO~y 
Depar tment, Derger said that, 
for the most part, "Professor 
conduct their rese a rch in 
collaboration with graduate 
students ... 

Not only do professors of 
biology engage in intra -
departmental joint re earch, 
but as Linds ley explained, they 
often combine efforts with 
member of the Chemistry 
Department , the Medical 
School and Scripps Clinic. 

Lindsley summarized his 
feelings regarding facully 
research : "Research is an 
excjting business a nd scholar-
ship is, from my point of view, 
one of the majo r functions of the 
university . A university, to 
really be a university, has to 
have strong research . And to 
have any kind of ro le in 
graduate education , it has to 
have people who are at the 
leading edge in their field . I 
think this university has that . I 
hope that the fa'cully can 
transmit to undergraduate 
students some of the excite-
ment that goes on 'with this kind 
of discovery ."

indicated. he added, that the 
laborato ry strain of bacteri a 
host mo t often u ed cannot 
survive outside the la boratory 
e nvironm e nt , a nd. more 
significa ntly , that recombina-
tions differing from those in the 
labora tory only by scale are 
co ntinuously occurring in 
nature. 

rirtel , is of two types, physi cal 
a nd biological. Phy ical 
cont. inment consists of things 
like pecia lized ventilation a nd 
ealed fla s ks. Biologi ca l 

co ntainment consists of 
designing experiments that use 
organi ms that cannot survive 
outside of a laboratory. 

" If I plan to do a set of 
experiments that are allowed 
(by IH)." Firtel said, " the 
chances of doing something 
dangerous are extremely 
unlikely. And if something does 
happen, we still have the 
containment ... 

Whe n public intere t in 
recombination was still high , 
concern in the San Diego area 
prompted the forming of a 
Mayor's Quality oC LiCe 
Committee. 

The way to handle this 
s ituation , accordi ng to 
Grob tein , is to broaden the 
representation in the public 
" decision are nas . Advances 
are being made, " said 
Grobstein. " and those in the 
future raise Questions of social 
impact" ,that must be dealt 
with. " 

In December of last year an 
extensive revision of the NIH 
guidelines was an nounced, 
Grobstei n said, after careful 
review of the new information. 
Grobstein pointed out , 
howeve r, that " this repre-
sented a relaxation in the sense 
that the degree oC containment 
has been lessened ... but not the 
degree of NIH supervision. In 
fact, " Grobstein said, " the 
a dvi ory committee to the NIH 
Director has been en la rged, 
with wider representa tion." 

Duchamp Viewed 
According to Firtel , " Most 

experiments that have been 
done indicate that experiments 
that are allowed (under the 
NIH rules ) just don 't appear to 
be dangerous . Th~y can't 
detrimentally affect people.
