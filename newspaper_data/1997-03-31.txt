UCSD Wins Supercomputing Grant 
AWARD: Partner hip 
will focus upon 
networking technology 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

UCSD will lead one of the two 
groups working to revolutionize 
high-performance computing into 
the next century, the ati onal 
Science Foundation F) 
announced Friday. 

UCSD's ational Partnership 
for Advanced Computational 

Infrastructure (NPACI) wa ' award-
ed one of two SF Partnership ' for 
Advanced Computational 
Infrastructure (PACI) grants 
intended to foster research into 
superfast networking hardware and 
software. 

"As important as it is to have 
high-speed computers for cience 
and engineeri ng enterprises, it's 
equally important to be ahle to 
export large amounts of data all 
over the place," UCSD hancel lor 
Robert Dynes said . 

The SF's ati onal cience 

MOVIN' ON UP 

Board advisory panel formally 
approved the foundati on's PACI 
fu nding recommendations on 
Friday, giving UCSD the green 
light to hegin negoti ations over the 
terms of it s award. 

Dynes added that the five-year 
F contract itself, with the poten-

tial for a five-year extension, is 
worth more than $30 million - but 
that the contract's true value will 
likely he twice that because of out -
side research funding. 

'The $30 is to get it going and 
to explore new technologies," he 

'aid. 
NPACI brings together 37 lead-

ing academic and research institu-
tions, including eight of the nine 
UC campuses, the three national 
laboratories managed by the uni -
ve rsity, CalTech, Stanford , the 
Scripps Research Institute and the

Administrator 
Announces 
New Layoffs 
CUTBACKS: Alksne says 
latest round of ho. pital layoff ar 
necessary to ensure pr fitability 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

SA FRAN IS 0 - The firs! task taken 
hy new U SD linica l Enterpri se EO Kent 
Sherwood will be to layoff nearl y 200 U SD 
Medical enter employees in the coming 
months. 

John Alksne, UCSD's vice chancellor for 
health sciences, told the U Board of Regents 
on March 20 that the layoffs arc necessary 
despite the $2-million surplus uni versity offi-
cials expect to post for the 1996-97 fi scal year. 

Although Alksne told the regents' 
Committee on Health Services that 'he antici-
pated between 100 and 140 layoffs. UCSD 
spokesperson Nancy Stringer said last week the 
number has increased to 190. 

Stringer conceded that the number of people 
affected by the layoffs may he m re than 190 
because that figure represents only the number 
of "full-time equivalents" (FTEs). For exam-
ple, two half-time positions equal one FTE. 

n/Guardlan 
Clothes make the man (or woman): Muir sophomore Fina Lam moves back into the 
residence halls after Spring Break, ready for another quarter of hitting the books . 

However, Stringer said universi ty adminis-
trators hope retirements, nexible scheduling 

and~ the elimination of overtime will allow 
them to minimize the number of people actual -
ly laid off.

Sherwood to Fill New CEO Position for UCSD Healthcare 
MANAGEMENT: 
Sutter Health VP will 
start April 28 at UCSD 
8y Terry Lew • 
News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO - The UC 
Board of Regents on March 21 
named Kent Sherwood the first 
chief executive officer of UCSD's 
clinical enterprise, in charge of the 
university'S hospitals, clinics and 
doctors' offices. 

As CEO of UCSD Healthcare, 
effective April 28, Sherwood will 

oversee all aspects of inpatient and 
outpatient care at the UCSD 
Medical Center in Hillcrest, the 
Thornton Hospital in La 10lla and 
the UCSD Medical Group faculty 
practice. 

The hospitals and patient prac-
tices have historically operated 
independently with separate man-
agement and support structures. 

Sherwood said he hopes to 
bring together elements of patient 
care, teaching and research to lead 
UCSD into the next century. 

''The opportunity to craft the 
vision for its future and to generate 

COLOR 

solutions that work well for the 
organization and the people it 
serves is exciting to me," he said. 
''This institution is an extraordinary 
resource for the community and 
I'm proud to be part of the team 
leading it forward ." 

Sherwood added that he was 
impressed with the caliber of 
UCSD's employees. He noted that 
many academic medical centers -
including UCSD - were slow to 
adjust to the shifting market forces 
brought on by managed care. 

"Managed care can eat you up 
and spit you out real fast ," he said. 

However, Sherwood said he 
hopes to help UCSD adjust to the 
new market realities without aban-
doning its reputation for quality. 

"We' re not going to forget what 
a health-care organization is all 
about, and I think that's easy to do 
in today 's health-care scene," 
Sherwood said. 

"I think the challenge is that 
we' ve got to integrate everything 
we're doing in a way that makes 
sense for those we serve, makes 
sense financially and makes sense 
in maintaining our leadership," he

The carillon tolls automatica lly

today 's popular music has too 
muny jumps to be played on a car-
i lion because some of the notes 
drown out the others. he explained. 

" Most often. we perform serious 
works that are specifically written 
for a carillon and sometimes spe-
cially wrillen for our carillon," 
Paulson said. "The literature writ-
ten for our cari llon is often com-
miss ioned by the UCSD Alumni 
Association and the Department of 
Music." 

Paulson is eager to unvei l later

that were wri tten by four under-
graduate students especially for 
UCSD's cari llon. 

The carillon has its own web

received the most "hits" of any

Wallet Thefts Rise on Campus 
MYSTERY: Thieves 
prompt added security 
precaution on campus 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

A rash of wollet thefts from 
RIMAC and other campus recre-
ation facilities has prompted offi -
cials to consider purchasing mini -
lockers to beller prote!;t valuables. 

This month alone. 12 of 16 wal-
lets stolen from campus were taken 
f rom recreation faci Iitie . The 
rcmai nder were spread across cam-
pus. from the Torrcy Pines Center 
complex to the Undergraduate 
Library. 

"They' re very much zeroing in 
on RIMAC, Canyon view and the 
Main Gym," UCSD Crime 
Prevention Officer A lan Jenkins 
said. "Up unti l recently, a lot of 
thefts seemed to occur Fridays and 
Saturdays, but recentl y they ' ve 
occurred at other times a well." 

"Physically. there's not a whole 
lot you can do to protect your wal -
let or watch." Jenkins added. " If

Jenkin ' said he sugge ted cam-
pus recreat ion offi cials look into 
purchasing mall lockcrs, like the 
oncs at the Price Center Bookstore. 
where RIMAC patrons could store 
their valuables in view of a staff 
mcmber. 

"It would be pretty dam difficult 
to defeat something like that, " he 
said. 

However, UCSD Sports 
Facili ties Director Don Chand wick 
said he was concerned nobody 
would use the small lockers 
because of their relati ve inconve-
nience. and because art ic les of 
clothing. backpacks and other larg-
er items are being stolen as well. 

"The advantage to those locker 
is that they ' re in fu ll view of the 
equipment room, but the short side 
is that it isn't ju t wa llets being 
stolen," Chadwick aid. 

While Jenkins said the police 
department hasn't ruled out sending 
an officer through the locker rooms 
from time to time. more coverage in 
one place means less coverage 
somcwhere else. 

_-.rrr_~ Sdan 

"There's only so much you can 
do," he said. 

UCSD Detective Sergean t 
Robert Jone ' said the police are 
investigating the Iheft and are tak-
ing steps to curb the problem. He 
noted that people should not rely on 
the lockers to keep their valuables 
secure. 

Chadwick aid the thief or 
thieves have been actually CUlling 
locks off and taking the pieces with 
them, along with the wallets and 
any other property in the locker . 

Chadwick added that he and his 
staff have posted signs in and 
around the locker room cautioning 
u er to keep a close eye on their 
va luables, but the thefts have con-
tinued. 

Chadwick said he, Campu 
Recreation Director Chuck 
Gormley, and Associate Vice 
Chancellor A.W. Russ wi ll meet 
tomorrow to discuss their options. 
and will likely make a decision on 
the small lockers at that time. 

Jones encourages anyone with 
information about the thefts to con-
tact the UCSD Police Department 
at 5 4-4359.

RAP MUSIC MERELY 
REFLECTS MODERN 
URBAN REALITIES 
By Naomi Fa lk 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

'll1irty years after the Civil Rights movement, racism is ram-
pant and lT)any African Americans arc desperately poor. 
Harassment hy the police in certai n communi lies is a dai Iy part of 
lire. These facts combi ne 10 leave many young A rri can Americans 
rru trated, angry and without hope. 

So-called "gangsta" rap is an out let of expressi n for these 
dreadful realities. Sut in the last year, the deaths of Tupac hakur 
and the Notorious B.LG. have allowed some people to claim that 
gangsta rap is responsible for urban violence. 

Rap evolved in the 19805, spurred on by the work or such 
ingeniou rappers as . WA and lee Cube. These artists distin-
guished themselves with a subject matter that was vivid, violent 
and gratu itous. [n short, it was rca l - an accurate relleetion of 
everyday life. Such tl1Jth fu l representation of real lire drew harsh 
criticism frol11 po liticians. 

In 1992, responding to complaints by politicians and poliec 
associati ns about rapper Ice-T's song "Cop Killer," Wamer 
Srothers separated itselr rrom Ice-T. Throughout the last few 
years, rap music has been demonized both by polit icians and the 
mel1ia as promoting violence and hostility toward the authorities. 

Rap slars such as Ice-Tand N.WA. did not invent the violence 
or the hosti li ty that plagues America. These were pre-existing 
condition wi thin the communities from which the rappers came .. 
What distingui hes so-called "gangsta" rap and controversial rar-
pers is Iheir brilliance and creativity in being able to adeptly lend 
voice to these experiences and provide a channel for their expres-

si n. 
Rappers ' expression or their true-lire cxperiences 
have proved to he an equally accurate retlection of 
the lives or thei r listeners. For many young African 
Americans, coping with poverty, a lack of johs and 

opportunitie~ , rampant , upply and use of drug~ 
and alcohol and the daily light to stay alive in 
gang-ridden areas is a common reality. Rappers 
like Tupac hakur have emerged from similar 
backgrounds and possess si milar experience~. 
Through their l11u~ic , rapper~ are "kecpin ' it 
real" for their follower~. 

Rap ha~ heen unique, 111 th at it ha~ received 
more ncgati ve attention and calb for cen~or­
>. hip than any other lype or mu~ie in the la,t 
few y~ar~ . At the same time, punk group~ and 
heav) -Illetal groups have produ 'ed music 
ahout Violence, murder. suiCide and rape -

mU~lc .:qually or even more oncn~lve than 
rap, hut The ~Iectivity of politic ian~ and 
the media in targeting rap music is ~uspecl. 

and i~ certainl y related to racislll . 
Politicians ar~ not rcally objecting to the 
nature or the mu~ic and to its all -too-hon-
est representation oflife in the inner city, 
hut rather to an uniquely hlack form of 
expres~iol1 . 

The conditions in which Tupac 
Shakur was raised arc common to 

many African Americans. Shakur 
grew up poor and ratherless. His 

mother becal11e addicted to 
crack cocaine, and he soon 

learned to fend for him-
sel f. As a teenager, he 
dropped out of high 
school and had to resort to 

se lling drugs 10 urvive. 
hakur had '1'hus 4 Li re" tat-

tooed acro s his stomach, with a bu lIet for the 
dot over the " in in "life." He defined a thug as 
someone withoul anything, a role with which 
he identified. Listeners are attracted to the 
music of hakur ror both his ability to afklress 
these conditions and hi own real ity of expe-
riencing them. 

To write off Shakur as imply setting into 
motion that which he sang about, to say that

UCSD CANNOT AFFORD MOVE TO DIVISION II 
Editor: 

You r ed itorial ("Move to 
Di vision II Will Increase Spirit and 
Pre tige," Gllardian, Mar. 13, 1997) 
would have been more accurate had 
it indicated that I the move I would 
also in 'rease fees . There IS no other 
source for the funds required to run 
a large intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram. UCSD wi ll he unahle to com-
pete . uccessfully at the Division II 
leve l (much less Divi ion I) wi lhout 
athletic scholarships, somethi ng Ihl 
campus needs to avoid, especiall y 
si nce so many needy students arc 
already only eligible ror loans, at 
best. There arc no successfu I 
Division U programs wi thout schol-
arships. 

UCS D has al ways been a school 
that stresses participation sports 
rather than spectator sports. [f stu-
dents arc being asked to recommend 
a move that is going to result in dra-
mati cally increased fees, they 
should be given all the relevant data. 
I peL onally would hate to sec 
UCSD abandon its highly success-
fu l, part icipant-centered Division III 
program.

Charter School 
Mission Clarified 
Editor: 

I Ihank Anna Vaisman for her 
thorough resea rch of both Ihe 
UCS D Charter High ch(Xll and the 

A. Y. LD. program, whic h wa ' 
renecled in the art icle "Reaching 
OUI" (Gllardial/, Feb. 13, 1997). 
There remain , however, specific 
points in that article which may be 
dangcrously misconstrued concern-
ing the charter school I'is-a -I'is 
existi ng outrca 'h programs. 

The problems hegin when 
Vaisman editOria lizes that "t he 
question of which [oll treach] 
method is hest remains unan-
swered," pi tt ing the efforts of the 
Early Academic Outreach Program 
(EAOP) against what the charter 
high school proposes to do. Thi~ 
comparison is invalid. 

First or all , I disagree wi th 
Upward Bound Director Jul ianna 
Rodriguez's statement that "the 
charter chool wi ll attempt to do 
what Upward Bound already does." 
Upward Bound and other programs 
under the auspices or EAOP do a 
li ne job of sending part icipating stu-
dents to college, just not to UCSD. 

Rodriguez claims that las t year 
"a ll the Upward Bound graduates 
entered college:' EAOP helps send 
students to community co ll ege~, 
Cali fornia tate Uni vers it ies and 
often to less competit ive UC cam-
puses such as C Santa Cruz or UC 
Riverside. I app laud those efforts, 
and affinn that Ihey arc necessary 
ror helping economically di~advall ­
laged youngster. get in to "college." 

On the other hand , the University 
of Cali larnia currently spends $ 1 (){) 
million per yea r on its outreach, 
recruitment and retention efforts.

from the local area and partici pated 
in one or UCSD's current outreach 
programs, Ihen we spend at lea~t 
$21,300 per low-lllcomc student

But companies like Sony and MCA,

wealthy investors should do the right 
thing and sever all ties with record 
companies that produce gangsta rap.

should do more to ensure that young

Center. 

The second winning PACI pro-
posa l, known as the National 
Computational cience Alliance, 
came from the CSA. Funding for 
the Cornell and Pittsburgh centers 
will be phased out over the next 
two years. 

Funding for PACI is expected 
to begin on 0 t. I. immediately 
after the current SDSC contract

The NSF currently contracts 
with General Atomics eGA) to 
operate SDSC, located ju ' t 'outh of 
RIMAe. nder the new program, 
the NSF will contract with UCSD 
- which will subcontract the cen-

ter '~ operation back to GA. 

Dynes said that while ome GA 
staff may be hired by UCSD and 
vice versa, the impact of the new 
partnership on the center's per n-
nel hould be minimal. 

The revamped SDSC will oper-
ate on a fundamentally different 
model than the existing center. 

SDSC and it superfast comput-
ers current ly act as a hub for 
nationwide re eareh. Scientist. at 
the center and elsewhere use it 
re ources to tackle complex prob-
lems that would be impossible or 
impractical to solve elsewhere. 

Dynes said that ideally, the 
NPACI network would identify the 
best computers in the nation for a 
given task and route the work 
accordingly. 

"The network should be sman 
enough to figure out which 
machine is best to do your cal ula-
tion ," he said. 

NPACI backers say they will 
crea te a national "metacomputing

years. consisting of geographicall y

LAYOFFS: 
Alksne guarantee 
profit to regents 
Continued from page 1 

Alksne said administrators arc 
,>till working out detail of thc lay-
ofls and that specifics arc not yet 
availahle, hut thaI "we need a plan 
in place hy spring : ' 

" We need to reduce our expense 
ha e by 7 - $ 10 million by one 
means or another," Alksne said. 
" We belie ve that there are enough 
variable costs, al least as long a~ 
our censu, stay~ ahove 200, that we 
can handle our fixed costs ." 

Alksne hlamed the layofb on 
the medical cen t er'~ still -shrinking 
patient hm.e. While vi~it, to the 
medical center 's clinics arc expe ·t-
cd to increase over Ihe next few 
years, the number of inpatients i, 
expected to fali. 

Un i versity officiab currentl y 
project the census, which av r-
aged 280 last year, will sink to 
249 by th e end of the fiscal year 
and will drop to 230-240 in fiscal 
1998 . 

CEO: New 
position was first 
proposed last spring 
Continued from page 1 
added. 

The CEO position is the first in 
the UC syslem to bridge th e gap 
bet wcen hospita l and m ed ical 
group administration. It was o rigi -
nally proposed during last year's 
top-to-bollom reorgan i lat ion, 
orchestrated by the Hunter Group 

Falling patient coun ts werc 
largely rc ponsible for last year's 
record $20-mi lli on loss. 

Administra!or~ laid off 517 people 
la~t spring in rc pon t: . 

According to A lksnc, those lay-
offs ended the over-stafling that 
had plagued the mcdi al ~e nter. 

" What we h;lVc done i~ try to 
reorganize the medical center in a 
more efficicnt way," he said. "We 
staff the actua I census, not what we 
wish the censu s would be." 

Alksne said UCSO will main -
tain a staffing leve l of 6 .8 FTEs per 
bed, which he said is '';,till way 
above the competiti on ." 

Alksne addcd he and n~w Chief 
Finant:ial Officer David Sakai have 
set up several performance moni -
tors - including patient counts and 
the ho~pilals' operating margin -
to prevent another such lo,s and to 
ensure future profitahi lity of at 
least three percent. 

"As we look to the future. I have 
in structed our people to budget for 
th e three-percent operating margin 
for the year begInning Jul y I ," he 
said . 

A lksnc guaranteed the regents a 

management -consulting lirm. 
A senior partner wi th thc Hunter 

Group, Brian Goodell had becn 
paid $63,000 per month since last 
May to lill the position. Sherwood

more than Chancellor Robert

Dining Express lets you do just that, by zooming around 
UCSD and stopping at bunches of amazingly convenient 
locations (and they don't mind If you brtng your teddy 
bear with you)! 

Bob and I rode shotgun with Becky and Mark the other 
day, and boy did we eat well! For breakfast Mark 
whipped up an enormous California Omelette that was 
just oozing with cheddar cheese, bacon, and avocadol 
To drool for! Bob feasted on French toast and yummy 
sunny-side-up eggs! We were so stuffed that we almost 
didn't have room for lunch, but somehow we managed! 
For lunch Bob had one of Mark's famous BLT's and 
macaroni salad. I dined on the Daily Special - Chicken 
Teriyaki with fried rice and sugar snap peas. Everything' 
was so hot and fresh and tasty. I was impressed! 

And if you can't find what you want on the menu, 
you can just ask and they'll do their best to make exactly 
what you want! No wonder Dining Express is called 
"The Happy Truck." Dining Express stops at the Central 
Cashier, Physical Plant, Torrey Pines North, and the Birch 
Aquarium at Scripps. Saturday and Sunday the Happy 
Truck stops in the Eleanor Roosevelt College 
court! So bring your teddy bear, your co-
worker, or your roommate, and 
tell them Gretchen sent you!

Hardballers Master Mustangs in Rematch 
~INNING: Despite having only two days of vacation for Spring Break, the Triton baseball team picked up three important 
WinS over the break, including an 11 -6 victory against Division II The Master's College that avenged an early season loss 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

For most UCSD students, Spring Break 
offered the opportunity 10 get as far away 

from campus, and every-
Ihing having to do with 
school as possible . But for 
members of the UCSD 
baseball team , the farthest 
they could get wa cast 
parking and Ihe Triton 
baseball ladium . 

Following a quick two-
day va cati on , UCSD 's 

"boys of su mmer" retu rned to their spring-
time labors, where they played a heclic 
schedule thaI included games on Ihree 
conseculive da ys. To make mail ers worse, 
the major trip of Ihe week wa~ an excur-
sion 10 Ihat hallowed Spring Brea k haven

for a long break. However, throughout the 
season Head Coach Robert Fletcher' s 
. quad has proven Ihemselves capable of 
comi ng back . 

Looking to stop the bleeding, Fletcher 
b.rought in senior Dave Siegel to shut 
down the pushy Oregon guests. Siegel 
responded with two shutout innings that 
included I wo strikeouts and pUI the clamps 
on Eastern Oregon State 's hOI bats. 

But thi s game was not to be a pitchers 
duel. The Triton orrense responded with 
som e thunder of its own , led by desig-
nated hitter Chri s Rondesl vedt , who fi n-
ished wi:h a learn -high five RBI' s for the 
gam e. 

After scoring three in Ihe bOll om orthe 
first, UCSD nOl ched one run each in the 
second and third and th en exploded for 
four more in the fourth . 

While the fourth wa, a big innin g, the

way to ,coring , ix more runs. The 15 runs

Thursday, when fac-
ing Baker (KS ) Uni -

opened il s Spring Break play by hosting 
the squad from Eastern Oregon Stale on 
Thursday . 

versity on Friday it was oUl standing. 
Michael Bedar got the start and pitched a 
three-hiller over six innings, givi ng up 
only a single run as he notched the victory . 
But the Trilon offense was not to be out -

After giving up seven runs in the lOp of 
the first, it looked the Tritons might be in 

done by it s pitching counlerpart, as the 
batters lit up Ihe Baker pitchers for 22 runs. 

Leadoff hitter George Escanuelas drove 
in four runs on four hits and also scored two 
of his own. Joining in the hit parade was 
first baseman Eric Pangelinan, who had 
three hits, cored three limes and drove in 
three ru ns in UCSD' s 22-4 bashing of Baker. 

On Saturday , the Tritons packed their 
bags and headed north 10 Newhall to face 
the boys from The Master 's College, who 
had roughed up UCSD 14-2 just two weeks 
ago. 

The Trilons wcre looking for a very dif-
ferent result thi s time arou nd as they sent 

Chris Rondestvedt to the hill to face the 
Mustangs. Rondestvedt performed bril-
liantly on the mound, givi ng up only three 
runs in six full innings, and he also helped 
himself out wilh a doubJe at Ihe plate. 

With UCSD up 8-3 after six innings, the 
Mustangs and the Tritons exc hanged three 
run innings before Dave Takehara and 
Mathew Li vingston closed the door on 
UCSD's 11-6 victory . 

The three wins rai sed the Tritons record 
to 10- 10 on the season. They hit the road on 
Tuesday to face Cal Baptist before return-
ing home to host Division III rival Califor-
nia Lutheran .

Triton Stadium Acts as Spring Break Oasis 
NOT PANAMA CITY: While perhaps missing some of the proverbial Spring Break debauchery, Triton Stadium was the site 
for one of the biggest track meets in Southern California, and the hosts utilized every opportunity in posting impressive results 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Imagine a bright, sunny Satur-
day afternoon during Spring Break. 
Over 1000 college students from 

around the country 
were gathered in one 
loca ti on. Wa s it 
Panama City, 
Florida, or maybe 
Rosarito or Palm 
Springs? 

Nope. The place 
was Triton Stadium 
and t he thousands of 

student s gathered there arc compet-

performances . 

The competition began with the 
early rays of the morning sun and 
finished under the glow of stadium

its ability to coordinate such a mas-

The Tritons made their prowess

in the long jump. Shepard has al -
ready qualified for the Division III 
National Championships in the 
hurdles and long jump. 

In one of the top performances of 
the day, senior Rhodes Walton 
locked hi s spot forthe national cham-
pionships and narrowly missed the 
chool record in the 1500m. Walton 

used a huge last lap to place in the 
top-10 in a field loaded with post-
co llegiate elite racers . 

Walton wi ll also look to become 
a multiple qualifier for the national 
champi on hip by running th e 
steeplechase later on in the season, 
an event thaI he ran at the champion-
ships last year. 

Al so notching a victory for the 
Tritons wa. freshman sprinler An-
drew Gon7.alcl. , who l:ontinued hi~ 
imprcssi ve firsl -year campaign 'vi I h 
a Win in hi s heat of Ihe 200m. 

~ 

Another surprise victory for 
UCSD came from junior Courtney 
Gray, an 800m specialist, who 
moved up in distance and ran her 
first co llegiate 1500m. Gray stayed 
on the shoulder of the early leader 
until 400m remained in the race, 
when she then used her superior 
peed to outkick the field and win 

her heat. 
UCSD gOI another strong per-

fonnance from seni or pole vau lter 
Creed Stary, who earlier in the year 
broke the school record by vaulting 
over 16 feet. 

The Tritons showed Iheir kill in 
the distance evenls with impressive 
performances in the 5000 and 
10000m by both Ih e men and 
wo men. In Ihe women's 5000111 . 
freshman Meli ssa Dusha slayed wilh 
the leaders Ihroughout the race and 
111.lnaged a lop-fi vc fini sh on thc 

way to a personal-best time. 
On the men' s ide, junior Gavin 

Klinger, an all-American in theevent 
last year, and senior Bryan Leek 
both recorded their fastest times of 
the year, narrowly missing qualify-
ing marks for nationals. Also in the 
men 's 5OOOm, junior Steve Varnell 
and sophomore Kevin Prindiville 
recorded personal bests. 

In the 10000m, juniors Neal 
Harder and Wendy Chiassan faced 
the challenge of running 6.2 miles 
around a track. Both recorded im-
pressive times. Harder missed hi s 
nali onal qualifying mark by 30 sec-
onds and Chias an chopped Ihree 
minu tes off her previous best effort.

Men's Tennis Splits Four BREAK: Women 's 
tennis goes over .500 mark 

weeks," 
The inexperienced squad is gaining more 

confidence as the ea on wind down and 
the lineup changes that were prevalant in the 
beginning of the 1997 campaign have given 
way to a stable and deep roster. 

NET A PAIR: The Tritons were able to split four matches 
over the break, defeating Calvin College and Redlands 

Continued from page 16 

By Nicole Vargas 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Establishing ahomecourt dominance is vital 
to a team's success. It gives a great sense of 
confidence to the home squad and puts fear into 

the visitor's eyes. The UCSD 
men 's tennis had won seven 
straight at home, but it went up 
against a tougher opponent and 
dropped its first contest at home 
during pring Break. 

The Tritons butted heads with 
four competitors over the past 
two weeks, gaining early victo-
ries over the University of 

Redlands and Calvin College (Mich.), before 
taking to the courts againsl UC anta Cruz and 
Williams College (Mass,), each of whom 
emerged victorious against UCSD, 

Returning to the safety of their horne court 
last Tue day, the Tritons hoped to bounce hack 
from a 6-1 loss to UC Santa Cruz in Claremont 
the day before. Williams College, however, 
retumed home to Massachusetl~ with a win , 

The Tritons hegan thei r Will iam~ cha llenge 
on the right note, while winning two of their 
three doubles matches, gai ning the early mo-
mentum and the first poi nt of the competition, 
The top-ranked duo of Steve Shabel and Ben 
Becker dominaled vi~i l ors James frank and 
Keith Tonkin, 8-2, while CSD\ Anthony 

Melicharek and Dave Murphy pulled off an 8-6 
victory in the third spot against their Williams 
foes. 

The momentum was incredibly short-li ved, 
however. as Will iams captured every singles 
match of the a ftc moon, No, I Shabel held on for 
three sets, as did 0, 3 Ken Liu and 0 , 5 Ping 
Yeh but their perseveren e proved fruitless , 

Less than a day earlier, the Tritons were in a

PORTS 
UCSD Leaves Rorida Feeling Groovy 
UNPRECEDENTED: Coach Gerckens and company notched five wins in the Sunshine State, improving their record to 17-7 
By Kevin McLaughlin 
Senior Staff Wnter 

Every year, the UCSD softball 
team travel. to Orlando, Florida for 
the Spring Rebel Games. For the 
last couple of years, this trip has 
only resulted in relaxati on, but not a 
lot of wi ns. The Tritons have not 
been as successfu l a they would 
like to have been. But 1997 is a new 
year and th is season UCSD relaxed 
und also grabhcd five victories, com-
pleting their fi nest tri p to Florida to 

date. 
When it was all said and done, 

UC 0 re turned from the Sunshine 
State wi th a 5-3 mark, improving its 
overall record to 17-7 for 1997. In 
Florida, the Tritons notched wins 
over Wiscon in-Riverfalls, Mount 
Mercy, SI. Thomas, Clark , and 
Ausburg. 

The three losses suffered by Head 
Coach Patricia Gerckens and com-
pany were all close contests - two 
re~olved with international ti e-

breakers and the other a 3-1 batt le. 
Playi ng two games per day, the 

Tritons began the week-long tour-
nament at the brand new Walt Disney 
Sports Complex on Mon., March 
24. 

C 0 dropped the fi rst game to 
the We tern Region's fourt h-ranked 
squad - the Buena Vista Beavers 
- 4-3 in ex tra innings. Kris tin 
Schueler went 2 fo r 3 and Eri n 
Cornell drove in a run , going 2 for 2. 

In the nI ghtcap, however, the in-

temational tie-breaker in ex tra in-
ni ngs provided an opportun ity for 
the Tritons to garner a win. UCSD 
capitalized, grabbing a 5-4 deci ion. 
The Tri tons improved thei r record 
to 13-5, thanks to great hit-
ti ng from Schueler (4 for 4, 
2 RBI ). 

Without taking a single 
day off, the Triton moved 
to a new si te on March 25. 
Playing at Ocoee, FL, on 
Tue day , UCSD notched 
two more victories. Aushurg 
and Clark hoth fell victim to the 
awe~ome La Jolla attack, 4-2 and 7-
2 respectively. 

chucler continued her per~onal 
assault, recording her third win on 
the mound again~t Clark and a 2 for

!\ushurg. Erin Bridges we nt 4 for 6 
on the oa and Erin Cornell pro-
vided all the offense in the lark 
contest hy going 2 for 2 with a walk, 
I RBI , and 2 run~ scored.

Thursday, losing'ln six inning). , 3- 1.

Fini~hing up the road trip on Fri -
day. SDonceagain splillheday's 
games. The international tic-breaker 
was nol friendly to the women from 
La Jolla, as CSD lost 5-4 to Wis-
consin Eau Claire. The Tritons 
showed their resi liency once again, 
defeating Mount Mercy to improve 
to 17-7 for the 1997 campaign. 

" In that last game, we played 
awe ome defensively," Gereken 
said. ''This was the best tri p we have 
had si nce we have been going to 
Florida. The team really bonded and 

I think good chemistry is im-
portant in the success of the 
team." 

ot only did the Tritons play 
duri ng the break, but they had 
games during finals week as we ll. 
Playing at Triton Softball Fie ld 
on Fri., March 14, the worn n 
dispatched with Claremont Col-

lege in a doubleheader. 
The Tritons squeezed out a vic-

tory in the opener, scoring three 
runs on onl y two hits. The rally 
came in the third inning, when a 
leadoff walk , a hit batsman, and an 
error comhined with a hi t and a teal 
of home plate to give the women all 
they needed to win 3-2. UCSD rc-
markahly allowed only two runs, 
oe).pite commilting four error~. The 
strong pitching of Mary Jane 0110 
dominated throughout the game as 
she ran her record to 5-2. 

In the second game, the women ' ). 
squad had little trouhle. This time it 
was larelllont who committed four 
errors. The women capital ized on these 
errors for eight runs on only six hits . 

The Tritons truly et:onomizcd 
their haserunners. while the At henas 
~quandered eight hits for only two 
runs. Erin Flanigan again pitched 
well, while the bats of Schueler and 
Bridges continued to sizzle.

FROM THE OFFICE OF UC PRESIDENT DICKY BOY: 

New In-and-Out to Open In Place ofTOQ 
A representative of Housing and Dining Services 

announced Fnday that the dining hall formerly known as 
Top of the Quad will be reopened later this year as an In· 
and·Out restaurant - a fast·food franchise popular for 
Its hamburgers and fries . This deCision ends years of 
speculation concerning the final outcome of the faCility. 

The Top of the Quad, located on the Muir campus, 
has been closed for repairs since early 1977, prior to 
the original release of "Star Wars." Several students 
said that they were happy about the decision and the 
prospect of real food coming to the campus. 

The sidewalk adjacent to the new restaurant is being 
rebuilt to accommodate a bike-thru, which would allow 
students on bikes to purchase food without dismount· 
ing. 

An executive for In·and·Out was excited about the 
prospect of selling the food to a group that has been 
depnved of good food for two decades. 

The new In-and-Out is scheduled to open on May Day 
of this year. 

Campus Media Evicted From 
Student Center 

After months of complain ts from the administration 
and concerned students, the university evicted several 
campus publications from the Student Center over 
Spring Break because of their wasteful use of university 
resources . 

Tam 0' Shanter, the edltor·in-chlef of The Koala, sai~ 
that a university representative told his staff that they 
had all been offered jobs at the San Diego Union· 

Tribune . When they returned later that day to the 
Student Center, their offices were gone. Similar inCl' 
dents were reported by the editors of the Blas ted 
Indicator, the VOl Taqueria and the Oittohead ReVIew. 

Freddie Engles , the editor of the Indicator, said that 
despite this latest VictOry by the bourgeois admin istra· 
tors and their running dogs, the paper will maintain its 
rigorous publishing schedule of one issue a year. In 
add ition, he said that the Koala and other campus 
publications will now be produced in the KoalaMobile, a 
Dodge Dart donated by a Koala staff member. 

A discotheque and study hall is scheduled to occupy 
the cleared space. 

MEChA and Young Republicans to 
Hold "Hands Across Campus" 

MEChA and the UCSD Young Republicans are spon-
soring "Hands Across Campus" tomorrow at noon on 
the Library Walk in an effort to promote campus unity 
and diversity. 

Representatives said that they expect several noted 
personalities to appear, including former San Diego 
mayor Roger Hedgecock, UCSD Political Science Profe s-
sor Peter Irons and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 

Although similar events have been held at DeVry and 
ITT Tech and at the larger Hands Across America, thi s is 
the f irst time the event has been held on campus. 
Members from both MEChA and UCSD Young Republi-
cans said that it was time that they set aside their 
differences .

Apologies to the Walt Disney Company 
A Gay lime in the Forest: 'Bambi ' is re-worked to eliminate all offensi ve references to minority groups . 

BAMBI 
STRIKES BACK 

Classic re-vamped for the '90s 
By Ilona Balona 
Disney Loyalis t 

Followi ng in the footsteps of the 
"Star Wars Trilogy," Disney wi ll 
release a new version of their clas-
sic "Bambi" with better graphics 
and a more politicall y correct 
theme. Hoping to repeat the box-
ofli ce success of "Star Wars." Dis-
ney will try lo att ract a loyal audi -
ence of both long-time fans and a 
new generation of tykes. 

Disney pre ident Jim Slacker 
admits it was uncharaeteri sti c of 
the company to play copy cat, "But 
hey, you can' t be first all of the 
time. Sometimes it 's good to recog-
nize a good idea and just go with it. 
Crayola did that with crayons and 
now we' re doing il with deer." 

One of the most blatant changes 
made is that Bambi will now be 
called Ibmab due to the subcon-
scious pornographic connotations 
associated with the original name. 
Among the new special effects, 
Ibmab's fu r wi II have a more "real -

LIBRARY: Qualcomm bails out 
UGL with $20 mil. 
Continued from page 2.99 

"When we got the call from 
Qualcomm, we were sure it was a 
prank," aid head librarian David 
John Murphy, "but the offer was 
clear: Rename Geisel Library to 
Qualcomm Library and they will 

istic" tcxlll re and the crillers will bl.: 
digitall y created. 

The story begins on a happy 
note. wi th Ibmab bei ng born in a 
lush forest - much to the de light 
of all the animals. The Ut pian 
bli ss ends chillingly when two 
mokers drop a lit ciga-

Gi ving new meaning tu the 
words "interactive media," a skunk 
smell will be diffused throughout 
the theater each time Flower. 
Ihmab's boy toy, makes an appear-
ance. Court ney Love will be doing 
the voice-over of Flower in an 

attempt to "stretch" her 
relle bUll on the ~ rest 
floor. causing a terrib le 
fire and nearly result ing 
in the ex tinction of 
lbmab. Luckily, mokey 
the Bear is on duty, and 
saves the day. Ibmab then 
must find his inner 
strength and save his 
new-found love Flower.

talent. As her last role 
was the voice of the pig 
in "Charl olle's Web," 
Counney is excited to be 
moving up in the animal 
chain. As Love put it, 
"Why be bacon when 
you can cat it?"

At the center of the intense 
cocktail of emotions the director 
mi xes up fo r the audience is Ibmab, 
played skill fully by Tom Cruise. 
Keanu Reeves, the voice of 
Ibmab's father, gives a perfor-
mance that at best lacks authentici-
ty and at worst is at a "Speed" 
deadpan level. '

fund ." 

The money comes at a time 
when serious cULbacks are consid-
ered for expensive subsciptions to 
obscure academic periodicals that 

. nobody in their right minds would 
ever read. 

'This is a Godsend," said com-
munications profe or David Rose, 
"Cancellation or those subscrip-
tions would have been catastrophic 

Also, in an attempt by 
Disney to increase the relevance of 
the story to today 's more diver e 
audience, each of the animals will 
speak a different dialect of English. 
The ironically named spokesperson 
for PETA, Glenda Sausage, who 
was at the premier smiling happily 
and chewing on Tofu Jelly Beans, 
said. "Our best converts are recruits

research project on corporate 
money 's influence on American 
media. Thank God for Quaicomm! 
Hey, this is off the record, right? .. . " 

The Undergraduate Library, 
pending approval. will be renamed 
Qualcomm Library in a ceremony 
at the beginning of Finals Week in 
Spring. A new "History of Cellular 
Phones" wing will be added as a 
part of the deal with the firm.

/' m ick and tired of hearing 
people argue about whether 
UCSD should make the jump 
from Division IJ 1 to Division 1 or

would be better served by mov-

best matche our abilities: Divi-
sion XII. 

Divi ion XII i the perfect

year, our athletes will be able to 
kick the butts of high school

Ben Dover Uglds Up The 
Scoreboard On and Off Field 
OVERCOMING: Star athlete caps off an incredible eason with a powerful burst at the end 
By Nick McMeathead 
Assistant Associate 

To score or not to score? That ' 
the question on the minds of all 
UCSD tudents. 

But for Ben Dover, it is 
not a queslion of S oring, 
but rather a queslion of 
"How much?" You sec, Do-

American occer, basket -
ball and haseball star- is 
U SO' . equi va lenl to su-
perman. Equall y ~ killed in 
the crease or lay ing down a hunt, 
Dovercan only be descnhed a~ grcat 
alhlete and human specimen. His 
sconng prowess is undeniably un-
quesl\oncd. And his prowes:, off Ihe 
field i~ legendary.

Is he the g rea le~ 1 scorer ever on and

"He i .. Just awe~oll\ e:' Jones ac

around the pl aY ing fie ld, if you know 
whal J mean. He \ a lway~ on top of 
thc situalion. and hi s performancc l!t 
exhilaraling."

For Dovcr, the life of a corer 

began early on. As the tar of hi 
elementary school pee wee quad, 
he was known to students a Dover 
the Lover. Forging a name for him-

elf at a young age wa hard 
on the stallion known as Big 
Ben. He was loved by girls 
and haled by the boy . BUI no 
matter, hc ti II kept scoring. 

Asked about hi secret 10 
succcss, Dover refl ected, "I 
always come prepared and 
focuscd on fini shing on top. 
If I don' l come like that, 1 

have no chance of oring." 
Throughout all Ihe Iri ab and 

In hul aliom. In li fe, Dover ha kepI

off the Ileld ; In an cievalor or a 
Burger KlIlg halh room - when-
ever he ha, a chance, Ben scores, 
and he doc, so wllh regulari lY. 

"He's the heM, I lell you," Joncs
