Reduction of 
Fee Increase 
• UCSD administration says proposal 
may not work in students' best interests 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Senior Staff Writer 

In re ponse to Governor Pete Wilson's proposed 22 percent 
student fee increase, the University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) has proposed $30 million in intemal cuts 
to be used by the university to reduce the fee increase to ten 
percent, the limit proscribed by state law. 

"Higher Education 's Fiscal Quagmire." a 6-page pamphlet 
authored by UCSA Vice President and Fifth College Senior 
John Edson, outlines the state's financial situation and the 
current budget proposals, including the ramification for wel-
fare, state employees, public schools, community colleges and 
the California State University. as well as the UC system. 

1be p;unphlet recommends redirecting internal funds by 
delaying faculty merit increase for the second stmight year, 
reducing price support for non-salary items such as supplies 
and utilities, eliminating funds budgeted for 1,100 additional 
graduate students and not budgeting for increases in staff work 
load.

South Africa's Mahlathlnl and the Mahotella Queens played on Monday 
evening In the Price Center Battroom as part of the Black History Month 
celebrations. The group performed a mixture of African rhythms and sounds, 
referred to by South Africans as "mbaqanga" - or ·poor man's stew." 

Edson said the UCSA also plans to join the Califomia State 
Student Association (CSSA) in lobbying the legislature to 
close $5.2 billion in questionable tax loopholes and to support 
Cal Grants, which are need-based state grants. 

TIle tax exemption loopholes include oil and natural re-
source severance fees, limiting tax avoidance by multinational 
companies and eliminating deductions for country clubs. pri-

UCB Tries to Rename 
Old Student Center 
By FtwICllco DeVrlee 
StaffWrlter 

1be University Center Board 
(UCB) unanimously passed a res0-
lution Monday night thai would al-
low student cooperatives free rent if 
the administration acts against the 
co-ops without UCB approval. In 
addition, the resolution renamed the 
old Student Center the "Student ~ 
operative Center. ,. 

Administrators, however, say 
that neither part of the resolution 
will be implemented. 

The idea fora name change stems 
from a UCSD Student Body refer-
endwn passed by 2,000 students in 
1989 which called for the official 

name change of the student center . 
1be referendum was never acted 
upon. . 

Even though much of the space 
in the Old Student Center is not used 
by cooperatives, UCB Chair Molly 
McKay defended the suggested 
name. "The Student Cooperative 
Center ... just means [students) 
working together," she said 

McKay contended that the name 
change would credit the co-ops for 
their fight against the administra-
tion. ''11le co-ops have been a hero 
in an attack ... you name your build-
ings after heroes," she said.

Guardian Reporter 

1be Graduate Student Association (GSA) voted Tuesday to send 
a representative to the Associated Students' co-op task force aflerthe 
university rejected the board's measure to allocate $200 to the co-

1be administration rejected the allocation primarily because it 
would entail using money routed through the university in legal 
action taken against the university. 

The allocation was approved unanimously at a GSA meeting two 
weeks ago. A similar allocation by the A.S. was blocked by the

SAA Be HRC Expected to Find 
New Director by Earty July 

• By EIIc ScIaIdt 
Associllte News Editor 

The Student Affinnative Action 
and Human Relations Coalition 
(SAA &: HRq is currently seeking 
a new director followiol the raig-
oaaionofDirector Anthony Jemison 
on Jan. 23. 

According to Dim:torofSpecial 
Services Nick Aguilar, a new dift,c-
torwiU be named to the post no I8ter 
than July I this year. 

Aguilar said Special Services 
Auorney Anthony Valladolid will 
most likely be named temporary 
director of the Student Affinnative 
Action program, while Aguilar will 

take over Human Relatioos until • 
new diftICfOr is found. 

ApiIar added that there have 
been no problems with the opera-
tions of SAA &: HRC despite Ihc 
temporary lack in leadership, 

Consuela Scott. Student Affir-
mative Action Council (SAAC) 
member, said there have been "00 
apparmt hitches, but there are gaps 
- issues that need to be addressed 
that are being put on hold right 
now." She said those involved with 
the program have been working 
overtime to fill the gaps left by the 
loss of a director. 

She said the gaps will panicu-

lady affect the "very delicate stage" 
that the new Human Relations pr0-
gram is in, since members are just 
putting out their first chaner. 

Although the long term goals of 
the prognun are being upheld. Scott 
said "band-aids are being put on 
important issues" such as the Regis-
lnIIion Fee Conuninee's review of 
SAA &: HRC interns and handi-
capped access to buildings on cam-
pus. 

Scott said leadership is needed. 
"The need for a director has not 
been diminished - that has been a 
non<OflCCSSion as far as tudents 
are concerned." she said.

• An experience at a dance 
production leads one student 
to reflect upon our views 
about each other 
By Trac:I Powell 
Staff Writer 

On the 24th of January, I went to a dance production 
at Mandeville Auditorium by Donald Byrd and the 
Group entitled "The Minstrel Show," The purpose of 
this production was to show us our prejudices using 
dance and other techniques. Itbought their method was 
very harsh, because throughout the entire perfonnance 
we were bombarded with racial jokes and insinuations. 

At one point in the show, a man came out and asked 
the audience to write down any "good jokes" they 
knew. Now I really didn't believe he would get much of 
a response, cenainly not as much as he did Later in the 
show, he came out and gathered up mounds of paper 
from the audience and proceeded to read them to us. 

I was surprised how cruel most of these jokes were. 
All of the jokes about blacks referred to them as 
"niggers," for example. According to this predomi-
nantly Anglo-Saxon audience, Jews are stuck up and 
greedy, Iraqi women stink and have whiskers, and 
Chinese women confuse take-out food orders with sex. 
But you know what was even more shocking than some 
of these jokes? 

The audience. They moaned, groaned and whined 
about how appalled they were and how disgusted they 
were at these jokes. But they must have forgotten that 
the jokes came from the audience in the first place. 

Many people left at intermission, complaining that 
the show was too disgusting and they had seen enough. 
But nothing in the show was as cruel as the material the

overtook differences and 
cn:ept a person for what 
they are, then why can't 
we? After all, we're so

kn<7N so much more 

than them. Or do we? .• 
We teach our chikten 

and thus pass the

tradition that is difficult

other advnements that 

the tuTal race 
continues to make.

audience produced. Of course, no one wanted to admit to 
being the author of any of the jokes. 

Essentially, you could think of this audience as a micro-
cosm of our society, and this is how we think of each other. 
The climax for me was when the man on stage asked if 
anyone had learned anything, and someone from the 
audience replied, "Sure, I learned a few good jokes." 

This got me thinking. 
Prejudice is universal. We all have some form of it, 

although we usually don't want to admit it, just as the 
audience didn't We often want to pretend that it's not there, 
or that we've advanced beyond that poi.nt. 

Truthfully, it's just more subtle nowadays. Prejudice still 
exists, and like a ball and chain, we carry it around. limiting 
and restricting ourselves. 

Then we teach our children and thus pass the burden on, 
creating a tradition that is difficult to break, despile all the 
other advancements that the human race continues to make. 
We've passed various methods to bandage our prejudices, 
but until we deal with the real issue, the situalion and all its 
pain and problems will remain with us. 

A major pan of the issue (if 00( the entire thing) is a \ack. 
of understandin, and awareness of each other's differences. 
In other words. it is an ianorance which raull5 in fear. 

Though prejudice is often a word used interchangeably 
with racism, it encompasses much more. Racism is merely 
one fonn of prejudice. It can also be political, social, 
relilJious, pnder-reIated., etc. 

But let's face it, people. We're individuals. No two of us 
are alike. That means everyone his a difference and a 
potemial prejudice with everyone else. Two people, for 
example. could be the same race, sex, reliaion, profession, 
sexual orientation. make the exlCl same: amount of money, 
have the same number of kids, identical dogs, twin spouses, 
live in the same size house, be in the same orpnizations. but 
have one difference. One has 8 disability, Md so they may

{Editor's NM: 1M following is a 
memo sent by University C~nt~r 
BotudChoir Molly McKoy toAssis-
tanI Vic~ Chtutc~/lor, Stutknl Af-
fairs Tom Tucur regarding UC 

Dir~clOl' Jim CarrudJers' soJory., 
Vice Cbaacellor Tucker: 

I have m:eived your one sen-
tence response to the Board's reaI-
IocaIion of the UC Director's sal-
ary. YourmemoofFeb.Sswed, "I 
am writing to affirm that the Uni-
versity Cenl~r Boord resolution 
(Jan. 27, 1992) totk/~tt the SQ/my 
of tire Director of University Cen-

t~rs is inapproprime and not within 
Boord advisory rol~ as lkfiMd by 
tire University Board Chaner." 

I will need further clarification 
on this issue. What is your response 
to the board 's problem with funding 
a position they have no control over'! 

1be current UC director has af-
finned, time and time again, thai he 
works for the University adminis-
tration and that he sees you • his 
only supervisor. H this is the case, 
why is it the responsibility of the 
students to fund his salary? This is 
taxation without representation in 
my view. How is the University 
Center Director·s position any dif-
ferent from the position of the Di-
rector of Student Services? 

This person sits in as an a officio 
member of the A.S., his job is to 
worlc with student governments and 
organizations, and he also answers 
directly 10 you. The only apparent

difl'aax:cis that his salary is funded 
by the adminisInIIion while the UC 
Director', IIIary comes from the 
$37.50 student self-assessed fee. 
What is the justification for this 
ctiscn=pmcy? 

Funher, I would like ClariflCa-
tioo on the definition of advisor. 
The University Center Board has 
been liven the authority to govern 
over the $37.50 facilities fee. 

It is the studenIs' responsibility 
to ensure the University Center's 
budget and space are allocated with 
the studenl5' best intere5l in mind. 

It would seem appropriate to al-
low student governance boards to 
operare with as much autonomy as 
possible. The Cbanc:ellor should 
have responsibility for financial sol-
vency, but in this situation, neither 
the A.S., the UCB oor the GSA is in 
danger of bmluuptcy. 

How is it that you are allowed to 
define what is uinappropriate" use 
of student funds over the student 
representatives who have been se-
lected to make these decisions on 
behalf of all students who voted to 
assess these fees? 

Our director has been quoted as 
saying he feels he is operating with 
the best interest of students in mind, 
even though his actions 1ft opposed 
to the Board's directives. Who is the 
legitimate aothority to decide: the 
students themselves, or the admin-
isualion? 

If you refuse to recognize our 
action of reallocation, I feel it is 
necessary to ask on behalf of the 
University Center Board and the 
students we represent to have an 
impartial hearing of this matter. 

We feel that it is an appropriate 
use of our funds and that we have a 
sttong case 10 back up our argu-
ment.

6 NEWS 

TIAN 
CIMII ........... 1 
demonstnlions thai summer, and 
believed that the demonstration 
which took place on May 4 would 
be Ihe final one before the students 
ended Ihe current boycott and went 
back to class. 

ButagnU~rgroupof"wknu 
decided to stage a Iwnger slrike in 
Tiananmen Square. Tian said he 
opted to return to c1us, feeling that 
further proccst would push both the 
govcnmenc and Ihe students to the 
breaking point 

Taan said he continued to remain 
detached from the movement until 
the evening of May 19, when Pre-
mier Li declared martial law . At the 
time, he was in the college donni-
tory. 

" It was very late at night and we 
were all watching TV. Then Li Peng 
came on and ordered martial law in 
Beijing. I got very angry at this 
decision. It was really a shame for 
the government to declare menial 
law in its [own] capital," he said. 

Upon hearing this news, Tian 
said, he and other students armed 
themselves with whatever they couJd 
find. Tian armed himself with a 
glass bottle, and they attempted to 
go out on the street. Their first 0b-
stacle was the school gate, outside 
of which were lined school admin-
istrators, communist party leaders 
and teachers attempting to keep the 
students from gening out. 

"We managed to break up the 
line and get out. I was one of about 
20 students who got out on the 
street," he said. 

Tian said that he and others re-
mained on the treets for days after-
ward, blockading armories and 
awailing the arrival of the People's 
Liberation Anny [PLA). "Everyday 
there were rumors that [the PLAJ 
would start crushing into the city, 

but it didn't take place," Tlall said 
.. Actually, Bcijina waa reIUI11ing to 
its nonnal order; Ihe buses ~ 
opeminglpin, you could take the 
subway apin and people were 80-
ing beck to work." 

It was in this seuing that r.nk.s 
bepn to roll irm Beijing, 

On Ihe evcnina of June 3, T.., 
lAid, he wu in the area of 8eijinS 
calledMo Xi Di when violencebrokc 
out In respo!lSe to an angry crowd' 5 
yelling and rock-duowing, soldiers 
riding in Pl.A links began opening 
fare. 

"A person who was SIandin& 
beside me was shot in the left leg. 
1bree of my classmates were in-
jured by the builds.. One was shot in 
the foot. I .saw another BUY get shot 
in the head and he was taken by 
others to the hospital, I'm sure he 
died." he said. 

Tianadded, "As Iflc tanks moved 
along OIang An Avenue toward 
Tiananmen Square, they [the sol-
diers I kept shooting to both sides. 
Actually, the soldiers were not sure 
about where to shooc because there 
were many~sandsofpeopJehid­
ing in small streets. Some of them 
were throwing stones at the sol-
diers. Some of them were cursing 
the soldiers. It was really a violent 
night." 

In the aftennath. Tian was sent 
to work in a printing factory for silt 
months and made to ign an apolo-
getic confession for his ro~ in the 
upri ing. 

According to 1180, it should come 
as no surprise that historians are 
unsure of the motives behind the 
Tiananmen Square uprising, since 
the students were unsure thcmsclves. 
"There was not a general agreement 
among the students about what they 
should achieve with the movement," 
he said. 

He said that there was a "biner 
argument" among thedi ideot lead-

Tian argued.

At least in the near future. Tian 
argued, we "cannot eltpect a real

the Olinese people are not used to 
democracy. It's a large cour1ry. 
You really need a very strong cen-

quote "I asked [the o1'flcer) several tines. but he never said

BUDGET Instead of the suggestions proposed in Edson's repon. referring to the wooing away of qu8Jified faculty by higher paying institutions. Both Lyon and Bond cited particular 
cases where a faculty member who is up for a merit increase 
is also being recruited by another university.

f~ increase over pos ible cuts in the quality of the UC. 
UCSA believed it had to lobby on behalf of the struggling 
srudents who must work over 25 hours a week to ~ ends 
meet. do not receive financial aid or those who do not 
receive enough." Edson said. 

According to the pamph~t, the fee increase will raise an 
additional $85 million for the university, $25 million of 
which will go toward financial aid to offset the increase. 

ViceChancellorofUndergraduateAffairsloseph Watson 
said he thought Edson's repo" was "very helpful." but that 
it had some flaws. 

"It outlines very well the financial crisis faced by the 
university," Watson said. "but the focus should be on 
proposal the whole university could suppon," 

Watson advocated a strong unified effon to lobby the 
legislature to reinstate ~1I Cal Grant funding. 

"It·s problematic to hope that fees released would go 
toward education," Watson said, voicing an opinion shared 
by Revelle College Prov~ Thomas Bond. 

"My biggest fear is that the UCSA-proposed cuts, if 
approved by the legislatUfC, do not have to be translated into 
a smaller fee increase." Bond said "Any savings could 
easily be transferred to other politically more attractive 
areas. 

"It would be a loss to the university, a 10M to the: students. 
but somebody would win. Everybody has a legitimate 
claim to the state trough." he continued. 

Both Bond and Fifth Co~e Provost James Lyon 
expressed concern over the UCSA's proposed delay in 
merit increases, which were left out of I~ year's budget 

"Mcdiocritycan be achieved very quickly," Lyon said.

"Faculty and legislators are' very aware that faculty 
median salarie!! are significantly below those of parents of 
UC students," Bond said. adding that a cost-of-Iiving in-
crease wiIJ be denied for the second year in a row. 

fJiminating funding for 1,100 additional graduate stu-
dents also would create a serious problem. acconIing to 
Lyon. 

"The pool of graduate student [teaching assistants] is 
shrinking relative to the general population," Lyon said. 
"We desperately need more graduate students." 

Bond said that. due to the recession. the university is 
receiving more graduate school applications.

Center Director Jim Carruthers said 
that. "Given the' cumot situalioo 
that we're in, 1 think this Jan&ua8e 
[of the resolution] confuses the situ-
ation ... My suggestion is, don't 
confuse the maner." 

Assistant Vice 0IanceIl0r for 
Student ProJrams and Facilities 
Tom Tucker, who waa not .. the 
meeting, agreed thallbc resolution 
did not helplMllm, and mairaincd 
that it would not be puI into effect. 

"The [UCB] docs not have the 
Idbority to rename a facility." he 
said. 

Tucker also said that the UCB no 
longer has the power to allocate 
space. 
. In a move to consolidalc power 

into adminislrative hands, he said 
that "any space qrecmentS must be 
sjgned and executed by the director 
[Carruthers],and that's ineffec:tfrom 
this point forward." 

Tuckerdcfended the:administra-
tion, saying they arc willing to fighl 
UCB attempts toasscrt more power. 

Tuckermaintained that the UCB/ 
adrninisttaIionoonflictisanew pr0b-

confusion with past boards - it is

administration," said GSA Presi-
dent Denise Fenton. 

"'The task force mission involves 
control of student fees. The ques-
tion is: do we have the right to 
control fees thai we assess on our-
selves in manners that we see fit?" 
she continued. 

Patrick Canoll, the GSA repre-
sentative who wrote the resolution, 
described the problem as a situation 
in which the administration was try-
ing to oversee the control of GSA-
assessed fees. 

"Because the rights of student 
representative organizations to con-
trol theirown funds is an issue com-
mon to both the A.S, and GSA and 
the UCB, it's logical that we should 
take united action," Carroll said. 

"By having a graduate student 
representative on the A.S, Task 
force, it would be a fi~ step in 
developing such a unified ap-
proach." he added. 

The GSA passed another resolu-
tion Tuesday night, expressing its 

current board anempts at gaining 
more power. Tucker said the ad-
ministration wants "a partnership 
with the boaRL If the board wants to 
spend iu time adjudicating g0ver-
nance venus advisory • there isnoth-
iog I can do about that." 

Tucker warned that such action 
might not be in the board's interest. 
"If the board coOOnues to seek clar-
ity on just what the 1egaI parameters 
are ... it could have the impact of 
reducinS student inftuence." 

UCB Cbair Molly McKay said 
she fell thal the boerd's attempts at 
gaining IJI(R power wiD prove fruit-
fuJ. 

She said thatduou&h the board's 
actions "there is not going to be 
more university inlaference. There 
is soin& to be less. " 

McKay said she also felt c0n-
cerned about the administration' s 
decision to funher reduce student 
influence. "It's quite aianning ... thai 
the adminisb'ation sees this as an 
opportunity to decrease student 
power," she said. 

Tucker vowed to tum down any 
attempts toamenc1 the UCB Charter 
to give the UCB more control. say-
ing that if a new charter is presented 
proposing "to give students super-
visjoo over staff and the granting of 
space without university endorse-
ment, it will be rejected." 

opposition to establishing NCAA 
Division II status for UCSO's cur-
rently Division mathlet.ic program. 

In recent months university ad-
ministrarors have discussed with 
students and faculty the option of 
switching to Division II in order to 
accommodate UCSO's growing en-
rollment and to facilitate the sched-

The game might also provide 
UCSO, which is in an unusual posi. 
tion in that it is the smaller team on 
the floor, with an opponunity to try 
an up-tempo running game. 

A quicker paced game might be 
a big advantase for UCSD, which 
has a much deeper bench than 
Menlo.

Staning the second half. UCSD 
looked as if it h6d slowed down a

jumpstart its offense, and the Tri-

Carl Young scored off a nice dish 
from Kathleen Alvarez. The second

Alvarez. meanwhile, was all over 
the court. She picked up four steals 
and three assists, all of them to 
Young, before sitting down mid-
way through the second half. 

The Tritons did indeed slow 
down during the second half. and 
Malone blamed herself. "I put us

UCSO can expect to notch anomer 
easy win. The Tritons trounced 
Dominican 91 -53 on Jan. 10, at the 
Main Gym. 

In that contest, Dominican' s low 
point total was the result of some 
troubled shooting as it managed to 
hit just 22 of 72 from the floor for the 
game. 

The taller Tritons had Iitlle 
trouble bringing the ball inside and

resistance from Dominican's 5-11 
point guard. 

The 2-16 Penguins haven' t seen 
much improvement since the last 
encounter. Perhaps the only bright 
spot has been the emergence of 6-5 
forward Ranille Powell,who is av-
eraging almost 24 points per contest 
in his last four games. 

Still, UCSO Head Coach Tom 
Marshall is confidentandexpecting

Brian Van Noy to .help compensate 
for Swindall's scoring ability 'and 
Eric Johnson and Joey Drake to help 
pick up the rebounding slack. 

"Everybody is really going to

Marshall. 

Marshall explained that Domini-

that UCSO's strategy defensively 
will be to force the Penguins to put

confident that with their quickness 
and height they will have no trouble 
shutting down the already weak 
Dominican offense. 

If Swindall ' s absence isn ' t felt 
on Friday night, the big forward will 
surely be missed in Saturday 's game 
against Menlo College. 

the Tritons were able to carry the 
Rainbows to the full five game

Wilde said, "If you never get to

Wilde felt the game was a whole

February Needs 
A flying Monkey 
O KAY, fEBRUARY, YOU finally got me. After liSlening to years of my 
whining about what a boring 
sports month you are, you 
managed to pull a good one OUI of 
your hat. Even the Spons lIIus-
fraud people had to delay their 
swimsuil issue unlil March 
because of you. Shccsh. 

For starters, the NBA All-Star 
game - usually (aside from the 
SI issue) the highlight of February 
sports - was even beller lhan 
usual. mo tly because of lhe 
appearance of Magic Joiulson. It 
was great 10 see Magic back in 
action. and Ihe play of lhe other 
All-Stars made me even more 
anxious to see that U.S.-Ecuador 
Olympic baskelball match-up. My 
pick for bellOrs? If someone gives 
you Ecuador al/d 80 point • tum il 
down. 

This is the first year I've ever 
had cable TV. and so I looked 
forward to being able to watch the 
exciting three-point and lam 
dunk competitions in their 
entirelY. I ended up being bored 
silly. with Ihe exception of the 
brilliant three-point clinic put on 
by Jim Les of the Sacramento 
King . Seriou Iy. 

Jim us,~ How did they let Ihis 
guy anywhere IIeur the rest of the 
AII-Star.;? Did he mistake the 
NBA AII-Slar Game for the 
CHA's All-Star Dunk-o-rama? 
Did I? 

S TIll. LES WAS far more interesting than the slam-
dunk competition. which was won 
by famous dunker Cedric Cebal-
los. Ceballos barely edged out 
LaITy Johnson, Betty Broderick. 
Don Rickles. and some drifter 
named Amie that NBA officials 
picked up on the interstate near 
the arena. 

Ceballos' best dunk was his 
last. after he had already clinched 
the victory - he dunked blind-
folded. It was impressive. sure, 
butl'vc seen similar feats before. 
In fact, the whole competition 
seemed to lack crealivity, 

Now,l have my own idea 
about what a truly creative dunk 
would be. I'm keeping my plan 
for next year's winning dunk a 
secret for now, butI'll give you a 
hint: it involve Willard Scott and 
a flying monkey named "Zippy,"

Spotts Editor 

For the most pan. things have 
been going well forthe UCSD men's 
basketballteanl. Currently boasting 
an 18-4 overall record and hanging 
on to a 13-game win Slreak. you 
might think that the Tritons wouldn't 
have a care in the world. 

Add to that the fact that the Tri-
tons moved up a notch in the na-
tional rankings this week from fourth 
to third, their highest ranking ever. 

Everything would be perfect for 
UCSD, which lravels north this 
weekend to take on Dominican 
College on friday and Menlo Col-
lege on Saturday, if it weren't for 
one small glitch. 

The Tritons found out this week 
thai they will be missing one impor-
tant element of their starting line-up 
- junior forward Andy Swindall. 

You might remember that 
Swindall went down in last week's 
game againSl Bethany and suffered 
an injury 10 his right knee. The Tri-
tons anticipated the return of 
Swindall bul found out thi week 
that he will miss the rest of the 
season. 

If UCSD needs a garne to adjusl 
to a new lineup and substitution

the perfect opportunity.

is anything like the last contest,

Rested Tritons Look Toward Cal Lutheran

takes on tough Division 
ill squad Saturday 
By Ben ElgIn 
Guardian Reporter 

While the UCSD baseball team 
is chasing a win on Saturday al Cal 
Lutheran. il All-American firsl 
baseman David Rex will bechasing 
a million dollars. 

Rex has won a chance to appear 
on "The BigSpin", where he will let 
hi fonune ride on the California 
lottery wheel. Unfortunately for the 
round-baggers. the television show 
will be taped this weekend, overlap-

ping with theircrucial doubleheader . 
Rained out on both Monday and 

Tuesday, the Triton baseball squad 
will travel to 1110usand Oaks on 
Saturday to meet the sixth-ranked 
Division ill tearn in the nation, Cali-
fornia Lutheran University. 

After sweeping Pomona-Pitzer 
in a doubleheader by a combined 
score of 3.5-8 and cOOlpiling a week 
of rest and practice. UCSD (2~) 
appears to have all the elemencs 
necessary to upset Cal lutheran. 

HeadCoach LyleYaresrealizes 
this is Ii once in a lifetime opponu-
nity for his senior clean-up hiner. 
"This is really an interesting devel-

opment," Yates mused. "It's not 
like we can tell him he can'l go." 

Y ales and the players are all be-
hind Rex, but they will have to stay 
focused on baseball this weekend. 

Rex, who led DivisionID schools 
with 19 home runs lasl year, will 
most likely be replaced by Marcos 
Magdaleno. 

Magdaleno is a junior transfer 
from los Madanos. 

1be offensive slack will have to 
be picked up by veteran leaders 
Ernie Isola and Doran Yount. 

1be hot bat of f'reshnwlstandout 
Dave V aldezand lead-offhinerGuy 
Cataldo will also be keys to a Triton 

victory. 
UCSD will get the chance, to 

prove how balanced ilS anack really 
is on Saturday. 

With the Tatons· vetaan pitching 
SIaff as a proven maimray, the hitting 
still has to display consistency. 

Though they mauled opposing 
pitchers in their firsl two games. the 
Tritons can only hope the rain post-
ponementshave not dampened their 
attack. 

It is diffICult to call 44 base hits 
and three home runs in one after-
noon a fluke, but sixth-ranked Cal

What is Going on SouIhofMaket?

brings enough dancing and 
live music to entertain and 
exercise the masses

It is a place where live t.ldscanplay to all ... 
on a spacious stqe. Bell of all, mosI of me 
events are under $10, which makes enleI1ain-
ment more feasible in these hard times (thill's 
recession humor). 

The SOMA club has been inundating San 
Diego with reuonably alternative "weekend 
things to do" for three-and-a-half years now. In 
a time when the experts are saying the music 
business is in a down mode, SOMA business is 
up. Owner Len Paul attributes this to his low 
cover price and multi-evem progranvning. Be-
ing open only Friday and Saturdays probably 
keeps costs down. too. 

On most weekend nights, there i always 
dancing on the upstairs ponion of SOMA. The 
scenery is changed every week, and the DJs 
keep the vinyl pinning until 2 a.m. There is a 
balcony which surrounds three-quarters of 
SOMA. and is an ideal place to urvey the 
inhabitants. 

........, Rambunctious youngsters jump around and crash into each other at a recent SOMA main-floor event. 

1be "dress code" for upstairs is black - the 
more black the beuer. Every now and then there 
i the displaced rover with a big, goofy hal and 
recycled '70s gear. but for the most part. the 
crowd is young, cigarette- rooking, and dressed 
to depress. 

Downstairs, affectionately known as "the 
dungeon," some local talent is usually rocking 
out to a chain-smoking and enthusiastic crowd 
of youngin . Downstairs the attitude tends to be 
a littJe on the punk side. No, not punk like a street 
hood. but punk like a local, fru trated youth, 
expressing pent up energy via loud guitars and 
breakneck drums. 

Prior to December 1981, SOMA was a 
floral warehouse. It took Pau I eight months 
and $200.000 to bring the club up to city 
code. Since opening Sept. 6, 1988, Paul has 
nOl had a weekend off. 11le club format is 
con tantly changing. 11lere is almost al-
ways local music and a DJ every weekend, 
and every month or so SOMA features a 
touring artist who is usually alternative. 
punk, or reggae. 

A local band was recently the one-thou-
sandth performance at the venue. In fact, 
Paul prides himself on his "nurturing" of 
local talent.

"It's like a parent investing in a kid," 
Paul explained, "I'd like to think local 
music in San Diego is the best it has ever 
been. [There are) lots of rewards from 
watching bands grow." 

And growing is exactly what the local 
music scene has done. Because of Paul and 
his SOMA club? Probably not. But most of 
his "main-Hoor" upstairs local shows draw 
well - three bands recently drew an audi-
ence of over 800, quitc impressive for an 
all-local talent show. SOMA is the onJy all-
ages venue in San Diego that can legally 
handle a crowd of 1,000. 

Whether one can attribute a growing scene to 
Paul or not. his venue is certainly an integral pan 
of the available venues which can offcr such 
exposure in San Diego. 

Paul said he doesn't care if local bands have 
recorded songs on a boom-box in a garage or on 
a 24-track recorder in a studio - if a band is 
good, it's good. 

A band needs to draw over 100 people in 
order to play an upstairs show; only a couple of 
bands currently draw enough to headline up-
stairs.

BY SEAN EVANS 
GuARDIAN REPomR 

Vel' winIer bIak. at home in San 
Francisco, my mother almost did 
a back- flip when I rccurned 
home from the Fort Alexander 
Bunker Rave (a bomb shelter) in 
time to pet the morning 
newspaper boy. I ooIlapsed in 

front of a bowl of com flakes as my little sister 
flipped the channels of morning cartoons. 

When J told her I'd been dancina all nighl to 
techno music in a bomb shelter with hundreds of 
other kids who couldn't have aU been crazy, she 
could only shalce her head and mutter something 
about leep deprivation and hearing loss. J 
considered talting a stand by defending my all 
night adventure, but then I would have had to 
explain what it meant to " rave on" through the 
night, which would take considerable effort. 

TIle under-
ground u~ 
culture of rave 
had engulfed my 
sense before I 
could plant two 
feet on the 
ground-and I 
hadn't even 
pondered how or 
why I had been 
wept away in ilS 

whirlpool of 
sonic energy. For 
me, the entire 
scene represented 
a release from 
conformity and 
everyday hum-
drum existence. One i allowed to "get crazy" and 
wear a hat from Wonderland, blow a whistle in 
lep to rapid electronic beats, and stomp Doc 

Manen's in a sweaty frenzy! Some have even 
described nlve as the punk of the '90s. 

1be LA. Times explains that the scene is "an 
ungodly mix of '60s acid test, '70s disco, and '90s 
tage technology." For most ravers, the scene is 

beyond literal definition. Some enjoy the pure 
energy and hyper·rhythms of techno music. 
Others are drawn to the scene' flashy fashion and 
progre ive tyle. Drugs playa part for some in 
the rave, and the preferred drug is the "feel·good" 
hallucinogen ecstasy. 

Rash floods of psychedelic lights, sets, and 
tide projections inundate the visual field for all. 

"SmaJ1 bars" serve refreshments with catchy 
names like, "Mind X-pansion," which are frothy 
fruit !lakes loaded with minerals, amino acids,

Add up these sensory inpuIs and your end rault

almost defies reality. 

1be adrenaline-Ioadcd rave 
movement staI1Cd in England 
and took the UK by storm 
during Britain's version of the 

• 
Summer of LoYe in 1988. Tens of thouYnds of 
R:StJess youth would flee to a secret country farm, 
or a run-down warehouse, to panicipate in this 
undc:rgrow1d and often illegal movement Rave 
favorites like bands the Happy Mondays, Stone 
Roses, 808 Stale, and Adamski have invaded the 
American chans. 

According to Dance Music Report's Dcc:ember 
techno-issue, "By 1990, the English govem:nent 
had to change its laws because thousands of kids 
were in search of raves. 1be music took over the 

entire youth culture. "1be question 
stiU remains: Will nlve culture catch 
on in the United States like it has in 
Europe? Will America have '90s 
flashbacb of Woodstock in 
holographic 3-D through the infinite 
beat? 

1be rave culture may have 
started in England, but the music 
has its roots in the Detroit school 
featuring foundirtg fathers Juan 
Atkins and his two high school 
buddies, Derrick May and Kevin 
Saunderson. TIlese three pioneers of 
techno began to make futuristic-
sounding house music as far back as 
1982. 

Kraftwerk, the electronic-rooted 
German group, was the first to 

break through with computer-synthesized music in 
the late 19705. Now, many of the best new techno 
anists hail from Belgium, Gennany and England. 
Obviously the idea of embracing technology 
helped spawn techno in Detroit. It is ironic that 
techno was accepled on a larger scale in Europe 
before coming around full-circle and returning to 
the States. 

Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego . 
have imported the phenomenon, which is growing 
faster than The Orb's "Pulsating Brain From the 
Center of the Universe." The rave has become 
almost too popular for some, and has lost its 
underground edge' by reaching out to the dance 
club and party-hungry masses. Big-time promoters 
like LA·based Avalon Attractions and S.F.'s 
Toon Town have crashed into the market and 
cashed out smiling by conuncrcializing rave. As a 
result. commercial hype has caused a dichotomy in 

"She can flash her eyes open and shut foster than a spooked owl jiggle

breoth·holding suspense.· JQckie Torrence is quite possibly the best 
known s'oryteller in th. English Ionguoge; combining gesture, facial 
expression, vocal sound effects, and above all, the poetry of her words, 
sh.e leads .her oudiences into a kaleidoscopic world inhabited by giants,

extraordinary circumstances .

"In my opioion, clubs are ju t jeaIou of

difference between clubs and undergrounds is that 
undergrounds move around each week to a

H6 HIATUS Tbc UCSD Guudim . Tbunday, February 13,1992 

in tile Rough 
+ Assorted Vmyl: The Price Center's student-run music store 
.,TedlunDo 
GuMdIIJn Repotter 

When it comes to music, UCSD students 
are a part of a unique situation on campus -
UCSD's on-urnpus record store, Assorted 
Vinyl, is one of a handful of such stores that is 
actually located on a college campus and is 
one of even fewer stores that is student-run 
and non-profit. 

Assorted Vinyl is a non-profit student-run 
enterprise thai offers products that are sub-
srantiaUy less expensive than those found at 
corponue record stores. 

According to Store Manager Joshua Rodin, 
"Assorted Vinyl marlc.s-up their products only 
to cover the overhead expenses. Any money 
left over goes back to the store." 

The fact that Assorted Vinyl is operated by 

and forthe UCSDcommunil)' creates a unique 
relationship. The people who run the store 
understand the need for the campus conunu-
nil)' to purchase its favorite music at reason-
able prices, rather than be subjected 10 higher 
costs at music store chains like Sam Goodys 
or The Wherehouse. 

While Assorted Vinyl may seem imilarto 
a co-op, it i in fact an auxiliary entelprise of 
the Associated Students. such as the Grove 
Caffe or Soft Reserves. Unlike a co-op, which 
is characterized by a lack of a hierarchy, 
Assorted Vinyl has a deftnile structure with a 
manager and two assistant managers. 

Although Assorted Vinyl is run by the 
A.S. and the employees are technically em-
ployed by the university, "the A.S. doesn't 
have a 'hands-on' control over the operations 

of the store and we are representatives of the 
students," Rodin said 

Thi relationship has been put into je0p-
ardy, however. with the recent events ur-
rounding the co-ops and the subsequent ani-
tudes opposing the Price Center. 

"There were some people associated with 
the co-ops who sullested a boycon of the 
Price Center, which was later made offICial 
when the Graduate Student Associalion voted 
to start a boycott," Rodin said. 

Rodin stressed that Assorted Vinyl is the 
only business in the Price Center that is a non-
profit, student-run enterprise, unlike the OIher 
Price Center businesses which are all outside 
contract vendors. 

"A boycott would hurt the students. be-

graduareArls Festival,andhas been 
going on for the past couple of 
years. 

It is a workshop designed to 
showcase plays wriaen and directed

depending on length, one or two 
plays are selected by facull)' and 
staff affiliated with PIP to be pul 
inlo produclion in front of an audi-
ence. 

The road to seeing aplay put into

students have to take a begiMing 
playwright course. or comparable 

WHEN is iT? 

Tonight: 8 p.m . 
Tomorrow: 8 p.m. 

and 11 p.m. 

upper-division literature course, 
where aspiring playwrights begin 
wort. on their plays. 1lten, when 
they feel they are ready, they submit 
the play to facull)' advisers Steven 
AdlerandAdeIe Schank forcritique 
and advice. 

Out of these submissions, the 
advisers decide which play gets pro-
duced. 

Generally, submissions are made 
by theater majors who have.been 
working on a piece for some time. 
and competition is tough. 

If the play i. selected. the play-

wright picks a fellow undergradu-
ate to direcl it, and the faculty advis-
ers play the producer role. 1be re-
sult for this quarter is the production

the infamous tenor Joe Thorpe, who 
is wanled in England for laX fraud. 
ThecalCh is that no one really knows 
if the real1borpe is even alive. So 
theeverover-sensationalisticO'Neil 
biUs the show as "Joe Thorpe: I he 
or isn't he?" 

As it turns out rather horribly, he 
isn't. and O'Neil loses hi lease on 
hi club, loses hi girl, and decides 
to return home 10 Ireland to search 
for the real Thorpe. 

That' the plot. but the beauty of 
the movie i the motivation for the 
search for Thorpe (Ned Beatty), 
which comprises almosl lhe entire 

ond half. O'Neil doe n't even 
seem 10 understand hi que t until 
he i hanging from a cliff al the 
hands of Thorpe himself. Why doe

save hi career, for certain, bul even 
more importanLly, you guessed it : to 
mend his relatiorNtip with hi fiancee. 

1be movie has its weak points, 
which are compensated for by the 
rest of its brilliance. Beatty, who 
u ually play the goofball idekick.

We can all imagine what Beatty 

The UCSD Guardian 

would sound like, and fortunately 
the producers of the film did too, so 
wehearanexpertlydubbcd-overvoice 
for the inging pans. He is also sup-
posed to be Irish, and at times his 
accent. or lack thereof is reminiscent 
of Kevin Costner' half-hearted En-
glishacx:t:ltinRobinHood. But there's 
somedlingabout Bcaay' pertortnaOCe 
that makes us want to believe him, in 
spite of the shortcomings. 

He displays a level of chari rna 
never seen before as a talented. but 
imple man trying to deal wilh hi 

past mi takes. He was nominated 
for a Golden Globe Award for hi 
role as Thorpe, and seeing the film 
leave little doubt as to why. Upon 
hi entrance deep into the movie, 
everything gets bener:, the storyline, 
Ihe tone and even 0 'Neil. In the end, 
we see a very different O'Neil. 

If Pretty Woman was a "feel-
good" movie, then Hea; My Song is 
a "nirvana experience" movie. 1be 
balance of humor and drnma makes 
for a movie that seem too soon 
fini hed, leaving you feeling that 
you have just finished a tenific novel 
about an enchanting, far -away place.

Assorted Vinyl not only play an 
important role with the tudents on 
thi campus, but it is also involved in 
ignificant relationships with many 

major record companies, as well as 
local radio station 91 X. 1bese com-
panie realize that the college com-

Since UCSD i one of the few 
colleges with a tore on the campus 
itself, Rodin said that "record corn-
panie know thai Assorted Vinyl has 
our finger on the pulse of what' 
happening in college music. TIley 
alway want to know what we, and 
our custorner.;, think." 

Assorted Vinyl also provide a 
place for local bands from San Di-
ego, as well as UCSD ludents and 
even faculty, to di play their talent. 

"We don't ju t want students to 
spend their money here, but we're 
also an outlet for their creative ef-
fons," Rodin said Assorted Vinyl is

the music industry. 

"Assorted Vinyl isdefinilely an 
opportunity to get your foot in the

If nothing else, Assorted Vinyl 
gives students a chance to get in-
volved, as the managing of the store 
i definitely a group project. 1be 
sludents who work there do every-
thing, from advertising 10 promo-
tions 10 inventory. 

Rodin wants student to take an 
active interesl in lhe store, saying, 
"I think UCSD i lucky to have 
something that's as cool as As-
sorted Vinyl. It really can be an 
opportuni ty for a 101 of people. You 
can lake thi place and make it your 
own, so I hope people will get in-
