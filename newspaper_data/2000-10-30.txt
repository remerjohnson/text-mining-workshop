Chancellor's 5K Challenge 
Raises Funds for ScholarshipS 
Chancellor Dynes beats AS. President in annual competition 
By LAllA MOSCIlIP 
Staff Writer 

Over 1,000 students, staff, faculty and 
alumni braved the damp and the drizzle 
Friday afternoon to try to raise undergraduate 
scholarship money and defeat Chancellor 
Robert Dynes on the course of the fifth annu-
al Chancellor'S 5K Challenge on Oct. 27 

Dynes kicked off the race by announcing 
"Let's go do it; and participants flocked to 
the starting point at RIMAC Field. Corporate 
and individual sponsors helped to raise funds 
for undergraduate scholarships. 

Dynes and his wife, professor Frances 

Dynes-Hellman, donated $25 for every per-
son who beat Dynes and for every woman 
who passed Dynes-Hellman. The event raised 
approximately $178,000, an increase from 
last year's total of $158,000. 

Dynes placed 123rd in the competition 
with a time of 22: 10 and Dynes-Hellman 
placed 22 nd among the women, prompting 
Dynes to speculate that their combined per-
sonal contribution toward undergraduate 
scholarships will be $3,600.

Students for 
Nader Hosts 
Teach-In 
UCSD group says media, 
Democrats, Republicans, 
distort political issues 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students for ader held a pre-election 
teach-in Thursday afternoon in the Price 
Center, focusing on environmental issues. 
women's issues and other "hidden" issues 
that event organizers said Democrats, 
Republicans and the media do not want 
people to know about. 

"I think we'd like to really charge this 
campus up politically and get this campus 
politically active," said Shaun McCollum, a 
member of Students for ader. "This is one 
of the best ways to do it." 

McCollum said that while members of 
various student organizations were invited 
to speak at the event, none of them was 
required to endorse Green Party presidential 
candidate Ralph Nader in order to speak, 
since the event was primarily one about 
issues, not one to promote Nader. 

Mark Spalding, a member of Students for 
Nader, spoke on environmental issues that 
he says are being ignored by the two major 
candidates. 

He said the world is facing a loss of bio-
diversity, continued extinctions, overpopula-
tion and the increased use of genetically 
modified organisms. 

"I don't care how they taste, I don't care 
if they taste good, [ don't care if they're safe 
to eat - I don't want them in my ecosys-
tem," Spalding said of genetically modified 
crops. 

Jose Mendoza , a member of the 
International Socialist Organization, spoke 
on the economy and the struggles of work-
ing-class people. 

He said standards are declining for most 
people because the majority of Americans 
have no stock holdings. 

"The majority of people in this country 
have not benefited from this economy;

JGot Milk' Campaign Visits UCSD Homecoming 
Milk-m ustached students pose for photos with cardboard celebrities from popular ads

Contrfbuting News Writer 

On Saturday the "got milk?" 
campaign came to UCSD as part 
of the Homecoming celebration 
held at RIMAC Field. Along with 
inflatable slides, moon jumps and 
face painting, the "got milk?" 
booth managed to attract the 
attention of many passers-by 
interested in hearing it$ message: 

"Make sure you're drinking your 
milk!" 

A recent national study indi-
cates that eight out of every 10 
incoming college students are 
leaving behind their primary meal 
providers: their parents. With 
more students making their own 
decisions regarding their diets, 
parents are concerned that their 
sons and daughters are not drink-
ing the amount of milk their body 

requires. 
"We're trying to have college 

kids drink three glasses of milk a 
day; said event coordinator 
Maureen Brennan. "[f you drank 
three eight-ounce glasses of milk 
each day, you would get the 
amount of calcium you need: 

Students often forget the 
importance of milk in their diets. 
Soft drinks and bottled water pose 
strong competition to milk, but 

they fail to provide the nutrients 
that milk contains. One such 
nutrient is calcium, which helps 
build bone mass, among many 
other vital functions. 

"If people don 't get the 
amount of calcium they need 
now, then they're going to suffer 
for it later; Brennan said. "You

Mendoza said. 

He added that the plight of the 
working class is often ignored by the 
two major parties. 

"Workers have no political party to 
call their own," he said. 

David Kuchta, a lecturer in the 
Revelle humanities department, spoke 
on what he called the "corporatiza-
tion" of the university. 

He said Nader rejects the "mind-
numbing and mind-closing" stan-
dardized tests often used to measure 
success in education and instead sup-
ports raising critical thinking and 
enabling people to participate in 
democracy. 

He said that many universities are 
run by people who do not Â·teach and 
who have degrees in administration 
and business. 

"When was the last time you met a 
Regent?" Kuchta asked. "I didn't ask 
'When was the last time you wrote a 
check to the Regents: but when was 
the last time you met a Regent?" 

He said universities should be 
more accountable to the needs of stu-
dents and that Nader supports free 
tuition for students of public colleges 
and universities. 

Other issues discussed at the 
teach-in included gay and lesbian 
rights, media distortion, the two-party 
system, Al Gore's oil interests and the 
crisis in the Middle East. 

McCollum said he was impressed 
by the turnout and hopes that many 
people left the event more educated 
on the issues. 

"Get involved; he said. "We can 
fight for change. We don't have to sit 
back and watch society go in a direc-
tion we don't like." 

Collegiate: 
Gossz'p may stem from 
having social advantage 
Continued frolft p.,e 1 
evolutionary theories - starts with 
the apes. Our primate ancestors 
cemented ties within their small social 
groups through the ritual of grooming 
and eventually, language, said Robin 
Dunbar, a psychology professor at the 
University of Liverpool in England 
and the author of the book 
"Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution 
of Language." 

"By schmoozing, you can maintain 
ties with several people at once, find 
your place in the larger group and also 
keep tabs on who is in power within 
the group," he stated in an e-mail. "In 
the modern jungle, these matters are 
as vital as knowing where to find the 
thickest grove of bananas." 

For as much as 20 percent of each 
day, our monkey kin sat around 
combing each other's coats to main-
tain alliances. As they evolved, howev-
er, clans became larger and grooming 
became less useful as a social adhe-
sive. It just took too much time to 
keep up with a hundred or more pals 
via nit-picking. 

The problem then arose: How to 
keep clans close with as little effort as 
possible? Dunbar believes gossip has 
contributed a great deal to the course 
of our evolution. 

"Gossip is essentially vocal groom-
ing; he said. "It's a means of main-
taining order in larger groups." 

For some people, gossiping is a way 
of furthering conversations that seem 
to be going nowhere, said Mike 
McDonough, a senior broadcast jour-
nalism major at Syracuse UniverSity. 

"There's definitely some innate 
desire to do it; he said. "People use it 
all the time to keep the conversations 
going." 

Others believe gossip's allure stems 
from having an advantage over anoth-
er person or group. 

"People gossip because it makes 
you feel good to have inside informa-
tion," said Janine Sprague, a sopho-

PINION 

Proposition 38 will give parents in low-income 
areas a new option and their children a brighter 
future 
By ANDREW JEFFERY 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

This November, Californians 
will be able to vote for a change in 
the education policy of our great 
state. If passed, Proposition 38 will 
give all Californians the chance to 
send their children to high-quality 
private schools. For any child, par-
ents can receive a $4,000 voucher 
every year to be spent on school 
tuition. 

Currently, California spends 
over $8,000 per student on public 
education, so vouchers will actual-
ly save the Slate 
money rather 
than cause an 
increase in 
taxes. This pub-
lic infusion of 
cash will 
in crease par-
ents' available 
funds to spend 
on education 
and conse-
quently increase the demand fo r a 
better education system. 

It is the goal of the proposition 
that the increase in demand for 
education will not only encourage 
the opening of more private 
schools but also force the public 
education system to greatly raise its 
quality of teaching. 

At issue here is not whether 
something needs to be done in 
California to overhaul the state's 

abysmal education system. Califor-
nia ranks 49th in the nation in 
math proficiency, 50th in class size, 
51st in teacher to student ratio (yes, 
that would be behind Puerto Rico, 
folks), and 51 st in computers per 
student. These statistics are not too 
impressive for a state that, if were it 
to be a sovereign nation, would 
have the eighth-largest economy in 
the world. Obviously, something 
has to be done to change this. 

State-run public education in 
this state is simply embarrassing. It 
has been left in the hands of the 
government for far too long. and it 

is time to ' take 
it back. 

One word 
permeates 
when big gov-
ernment is 
referred to : 
bureaucracy 
Anyone not 
familiar with 
this word need 
simply walk 

into any administration building

The next elections will be 
accompanied, as usual, by a pletho-
ra of propositions on the most 
diverse arguments. As it happened 
on previous occasions, some of the 
arguments have gone more or less 
unnoticed , while others have 
received quite a lot of advertising 
which, in the age of television, 
appears to be the true measure of 
political relevance. 

Among these, Proposition 38 -
the school vouchers initiative - is, 
I believe, the 

private schools give. 
This is plainly not true. Vouch-

ers will run to $4,000 per year, but 
the best private schools have a 
much higher tuition . Consequent-
ly, even with the voucher system in 
place, these schools will be out o f 
reach to the less wealthy. In these 
cases, vouchers will be JUSt a 
donation of taxpayer money to th e 
rich so that they will be able to 
send their children to expensive 
private schools and save money: 
They will have their pudding and 
eat it too.

The school voucher initiative is

Many pri-

elitist and catering to a restricted 
community. When thousands of 
voucher-equipped children knock

will be to reject them (sending 
them back to public schools) or to

Prop. 36: A 
Threat to 
Society 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

Proposition 36 is a dangerous 
and misleading initiative that will 
only compound our growing drug 
epidemic. 

The proponents of the initiative 
argue that since the war on drugs 
failed and nonviolent drug crimi-
nals are overcrowding the jails 
while violent criminals are released 
early, drug diversion programs are 
the only solution. 

Yet Proposition 36 will inflict 
irreparable harm on society by pro-
hibiting the option of jail for indi-
viduals convicted of using heroin, 
crack, PCP, methamphetamine and 
other illegal drugs. 

According to the summary rre-
pared by the anorney genera on 
the initilltivC, if a person is convict-
ed of the possession, use, trans-
portation for personal use or being 
under the inflllence of controlled 
substances, that person automati-
cally receives probation and drug 
treatment. Under these Proposi-
tion 36 provisions, the drug 
offender would not be sent to jail 
for using illegal drugs. 

This rigid inflexibility by the ini-
tiative does not leave room for a 
judge's or the district attorney's 
interpretation of the facts or 
whether the history of a defendant 
should warrant another course of 
action other than the mandatory 
treatment. 

Another factor to take into 
consideration is that not all drug 
offenders are responsive to treat-
ment, and many dru~ abusers 
pose a real threat to society if they 
are let back on the streets after 
"treatment." 

Proposition 36 allows potential-
ly dangerous drug abusers to 
remain on the street because the 
initiative's safeguards are not 
strong enough. . 

Although the initiative bars 
from automatic diversion criminals 
previously convicted in California 
of serious or violent felonies, this 
does not apply to out-of-state con-
victions. 

Therefore, according to the 
analysis by the Criminal Justice 
Legal Foundation on the initiative, 
"someone with out-of-state con-
victions for rape or drug-related 
murders must be diverted without 
regard to the obvious threat to 
public safety of keeping such a per-
son on the streets." 

The mOSt shocking part of the 
initiative is the fact that the drug 
conviction wilr be expunged from 
the record of the criminal once 
treatment is completed. 

It is obVIOUS that the intent of 
this initiative is not to stop the 
usage of illegal drugs, but to 
decriminalize drugs. "Their agenda 
is clear, W said executive director of 
the California District Anorney's 
Association Lany Brown. "They 
want to legalize drugs. W 

This initiative is sending a very 
loud and clear message: "Go ahead 
and use drugs, for you will get free 
treatment from the state, and we 
also will make sure your record is 
cleared so that it appears your con-
viction never took place.Â· 

[ cannot believe that if people 
break the law by using some illegal 
drug. they will have their records 
wiped clean once treatment is 
undergone; yet people who drink 
and drive will never get a conviction 
of driving under the influence of 
alcohol expunged from their 
records. Why the double standard?

Despite Good Tunes, Some Will Try to Steal 
In the IN ew Economy', some consumers will cheat their way out of paying 
By NIINAZ TAHIIII 
ContributIng Staff Writer 

In an era when gas prices are 
hardly manageable and movie 
ticket prices have almost tripled, 
consumers have resorted to break-
ing the rules. 

Cheating: It is a word that has 
come up time and time again, 
whether in school, relationships or 
even in the White House. But the 
term Â·cheatingW has taken a phe-
nomenal tum with many well-oft' 
people nowadays. With the econo-
my in full bloom, more and more 
people are, for some twisted rea-
son, taking advantage of the sys-
tem by cheating at their own con-
venience. 

For some time, Americans have 
been involved in what is known as 
.petty cheatin$'Â· With such acts as 
stiffing the bill at a restaurant, 
returning already-worn clothes, 
sneaking into movie theaters and 
crashing expensive golf courses, 
people have increasingly decided 
to cheat the system yet gain its 
rewards. 

Though we have all been 
known to break the rules at one 
time or another, the concept of 

breaking the law has never been a 
problem for those who feel the 
repercussions are worth it. While 
some do it to protest the high 

pri~es that have surfaced recently 
for staples such as gas and food, 
others feel that paying is nothing 
compared to the thrill or satisfac-
tion of taking what they feel was 
theirs to begin with. 

According to a recent article in 
the Wall Street Journal, one man 
would sneak from coach to first-
class searing in airplanes: "The 
humiliation of getting sent back to 
coach was nothing compared to 
the thrill of a free upgrade.w 

While petty cheating has 
always existed, it has been report-
ed that there has been an increase 
since the recent economic boom. 
This, however, is the ironic point 
of the issue at hand, and quite a 
bothersome one at that. While 
many have reaped the benefits of 
this economic boom, they are the 
same people who are resorting to 
peny thefts and cheating. This 
begs the question: Why? 

The anger and frustration of 
paying endless taxes and being 
shortchanged after the economic 
boom has driven most to cheat the 

system, not necessarily by stealing, 
but rather by trying to get back 
what they feel they deserve. 
According to the Wall Street Juur-
naJ, "In an era of $3 greeting cards 
and $2-a-gallon gasoline, a sur-
prising number of consumers feel 
entitlt!d to cheat." With "entitled" 
being the key word, consumers are 
finally puning their foot down, 
and it seems that they are doing so 
JUSt in time. 

It is only fair to say that it is 
Americans that are being cheated, 
not organizations cheating Ameri-
cans. Although stiffing the bill at a 
restaurant and sneaking into first 
class are not suitable ways to get 
back at the government for high 
prices, people nowadays seem to 
have no other choice. Americans 
are slowly beginning to feel the 
pressure of the high prices and the 
enormous strains they have to go 
through in order to get what they 
want. 

For instance, going out to a 
single movie today costs an aver-
age of $8 for the ticket, not to 
mention another $10 for popcorn 
and drinks - $20 to see a single 
movie, when only 30 years ago, it 
cost $2 at most. With these num-

bers, it is no wonder that Ameri-
cans have resorted to cheating the 
system. By taking back what they 
feel was taken from them, Ameri-
cans are fighting back. 

It may seem as though these 
so-called "cheaters" are getting 
away with what they want; the 
truth is that they are. Businesses 
today are more lenient than they 
once were because competition is 
increasing and the satisfaction of 
the customer seems to be first on 
the list. 

Again, the concept of the econ-
omy and high prices have resulted 
in a different mode of expecta-
tions. Clothing stores have loos-
ened their policies on returns. 
Restaurants believe that a happy 
customer is a paying customer. 
While all of this may seem like it 
would discourage cheaters, it has 
unexpectedly enticed them to 
behave even more badly. 

In a sense, that is the problem: 
While most businesses stand to 
complain about these cheaters. 
they do not take the necessary 
actions to stop them. With busi-
nesses failing to act out on the

6 OPINION 

Pro: 
Proposition 38 will give 
positive results to society 
continued from .... 4 
red tape, paperwork and political 
bumblings that it is impossible for 
our public school system to be 
responsive and cutting-edge. How 
can we expect our children to keep 
pace with a society moving forward 
at an astounding rate if public 
schools are just now beginning to 
concede that children o( all ages 
need to have access to computers? 

The availability of school 
v~uchers to every parent in Califor-
nia will empower the public and 
give parents the ability to choose 
who will educate their children. 
The parents can take this choice 
away from some bureaucrat in 
Sacramento who sees their child as 
a number, a cost and a future con-
stituent. 

Private schooling will no longer 
be a privilege set aside for the rich. 
Instead, the children who need 
help the most will get the boost 
they need to reach their goals. 

In examining any public policy, 
one must look at who the proposi-
tion is meant to help. While Propo-
sition 38 will indeed give all parents . 
the ability to take advantage of 
$4,000 per year for private school, 
it is the economically underprivi-
leged who truly stand to benefit 
from the introduction of vouchers. 

Inner-city and other areas of 
poor economic standing have, by 
far. the worst public schools in the 
state. In Los Angeles. the closer 
children live to downtown. the 
worse their public schools get. 
Within a 10-mile radius of the cen-
ter of Los Angeles. 22 elementary 
schools received an "An school rat-
ing in the year 2000 based on their 
Academic Performance Index 
score. an aptitude test taken by all 
students and averaged for the 

school as a whole. Reduce it to a 
five-mile radius and you get only 
one school who received an "A." If 
a person is brave enough to go 
within a two-mile radius of down-
town, one "D-" tops a long list of 
"F's,'" _ 

Compare this data to that of 
Palo Alto where within a 10-mile 
radius of downtown, 40 schools 
have "A" ratings, and within two 
miles. 16 schools received "A's" in 
2000. There is an educational 
divide in this state and the line is 
clearly drawn along racial. ethnic 
and socio-economic boundaries. 

For families living in the inner 
city. parents have no choice but to 
send their children to schools like 
Lincoln Elementary in the Comp-
ton Unified School District. where 
only 13 percent of teachers have 
full teaching credentials. Our soci-
ety cannot be content with this 
being parents' only choice for their 
children's education. 

It is, however, futile to argue that 
inner-city schools are not in need 
of some serious change. so let us 
focus on what can be done now to 
help kids growing up in such 
deplorable schools. We do not need 
a government program to increase 
funding slowly over the next five 
years. We need a fix now. Children 
who will be starting kindergarten 
next fall need to have the choice to 
attend a school with qualified 
teachers, sufficient supplies and an 
environment in which they can 
flourish and avoid following the 
same path as this year's kinder-
garten class at Lincoln. 

As income distribution in the 
United States. and especially in 
California. becomes increasingly 
skewed. we cannot continue to let 
education do the same. The one 
true way to start to chip away at 
the economic gap in this state is to 
start at the bottom. Better educat-
ed 5 year-olds means better edu~

Con: 
School vouchers will not 
help encourage diversity 
........ ".. ...... 

many countries over many years 
have shown that, when at its 
best, only public education can 
provide quality education to a 
large number of people. Inferring 
from the success of private 
schools in niches to their suit-
ability for mass education is a 
non sequitur. 

The choice that the poor will 
really have will be between "sec-
ond class" private schools. which 
will have all the problems of 
today's public schools but for 
which the voucher money will be 
sufficient, or a degraded, even 
more underfunded public school 
system. 

One should also include in the 
count of choices the number of 
children whose parents simply do 
not care. 

Those children's only option 
will be to go to public schools, 
no matter how degraded or 
underfunded the schools are. 
Voucher proponents assume that 
a lot of people will be left behind 
and they do not seem to car.e 
about it. 

It should also be considered 
that public schools must, by law, 
accept everybody, while private 
schools are under no such obliga-
t.ion. Many private schools are 
religious in nature. One can 
expect that, with a voucher system 
firmly in place, their number 
would swell. 

Religious private schools will 
try very hard not to accept. say, 
atheists, gay teen-agers or chil-
dren of gay parents. [f you think 
that they will not, just look at all 
the trouble the Boy Scouts went 
through in order to get rid of a gay 
leader. Atheists. gays and other

people whom the religious orga-
nizations do not like WIll therefore 
have the quality of their education 
severely restricted by the voucher 
system, independent of how 
much money they have. If you are 
gay, atheist, and poor ... well. you 
should probably start thinking 
about going to Canada to get an 
education. 

These considerations arc 
based on the assumption that 
vouchers, taking funds away from 
public schools, will degrade the 
quality of public education. 

[ heard some supporters of 
the proposition say competition

with the private sector will actu-
ally benefit public schools. 
Monopoly made them too confi-
dent and sloppy, while competi-
tion will make them lean and 
efficient. 

This is a vC;ry diffuse misun-
derstanding, originating in the 
illusion that the mechanisms that 
regulate the market should be 
applied to everything. Logically, 
the fact that competition is good 
for industrial production does not 
imply that competition will be 
good for education. 

This opinion is part of the 
same misguided excitement for 
"effectiveness" and "performance" 
that brings leading legislators and 
school boards to use test scores as 
a measure of the success of a pub-
lic school. 'According to some 
proposals. if a public school per-
formsÂ· poorly on tests. its students 
are entitled to vouchers to go to 
private schools. 

Monday, October 30, 2000 

Every person with a modicum 
of common sense can see what 
will happen . Incited by competi-
tion in what will be - I use an 
expression dear to many today -
"the new and exciting market of 
education." schools will stop edu-
cating students and will concen- . 
trate instead in making them per-
fect test-taking machines. 

[t is possible, experience 
shows, to score very well in a mul-
tiple-choice test and still be 
blessed with the most abysmal 
ignorance. 

Only last week. a RAND 
study showed that a lot of the 
much-touted education success 
of George W. Bush was exactly of 
this nature: Test scores went up 
:n Texas, but ' children from 
minority groups are not better 
educated. 

Needless to say, education is a 
much more complex issue and 
cannot be measured with a sim-
ple multiple-choice test, if it can 
be measured at all. Ultimately, 
one must abandon the delusions 
of an all-encompassing test and 
go back to trusting human judg-
ment: in this case, that of the 
teachers. 

The silly drive toward market-
style competition, which voucher 
proponents hail with enthusiasm, 
will place more and more empha-
sis on test-taking strategies and 
remove it from the true mission of 
a school: to create intelligent, tol-
erant. cultivated individuals with 
many interests and pondered 
opinions. 

The final blow to the idea of 
vouchers may be given by the 
simple observation that the coun-
tries with the highest quality of 
education in the world are all 
based on comprehensive. fair and 
well-developed public systems. 
Private schools constitute a niche 
ded icated to serve special needs

ing about the UC Regents. The 
regents arc the ultimate decision-
makers in the University of Cali-
fornia. and their next meeting is 
Nov. 15 to Nov. 16 at the UCLA 
campus. This meeting is important 
for many people and especially 
important for students. 

At the November meeting, the 
regents will review and pass the 
annual budget for the university. 
The budget will detail the base 
expenditures and a list of initiatives 

the universities has planned if the 
California legislature provides the 
required financial resources. 

After this meeting. the real fun 
begins. Chancellors, administrators 
and UC lobbyists use the budget 
approved in November to pressure 
elected officials to allocate enough 
funding to make everyone in the 
university happy. Not surprisingly, 
students are often left out of the 
UC budget process. Although our 
needs are great, student concerns 
and budget priorities are often 
overlooked. 

This year. the University of 
California Student Association, a 
coalition of student government 
associations, has developed a 
unique budget proposal for the 
UC Regents to consider. The 
budget proposal asks the univer-
sity to increase the financial sup-
port to student retention services 
by $30 million. This proposal 
would not increase student fees, 
as. opposed to funding these ser-
vices through a student fcc refer-
endum. 

Student retention services are 
vital programs that greatly 
improve the quality of our educa-
tion and increase the retention 
rates of underrepresented stu-
dents. Student health centers, 
multicultural centers. disability 
resources centers and counseling 
services arc all excellent examples 
of student retention services. The 
services have not seen any sub-
stantial new funding increases in 
over 10 years. Insufficient funding 
threatens the existence of these 
programs and limits the amount 
of resources these services can 
provide.

going against businesses is a way 
in which consumers can get back 
at a system that has contin}.lously 
cheated them. 

Breaking the rules has been a 
continuing backlash against a 
government that the American 
people believe to be unjust. It is 
evident that there should be 
something done on the side of 
both the government and the peo-
ple in 'order to reduce the contin-
uous stealing that has developed. 
Since the economy is at such a 
high. the government could take 
some of its surplus and use it to 
reduce prices of goods such as 
gasoline. People could also do 
their part by refraining from tak-
ing away from businesses and 
cheating the system. 

Although there might not be 

responsibility for their illegal 
activities. 

Yet. under this initiative, drug 
abusers are given a "get out of jail 
free" card, and with treatment, a 
lily-white record. 

Unfortunately, there are loop-
holes in this proposition to keep 
addicts addicted and the drug 
cycle going. For instance, a drug 
user has three chances to try to 
get clean before probation is 
revoked and he is put in county â¢ 
jail for 30 days.

aids getting into better colleges 
and making a life for their chil-

empowerment of parents will 
accomplish this. goal. 

The. issue at hand here is 
choice. Pure and simple, parents 
deserve a choice when sendi ng 
their kids 10 school. If they do not 
want to send their child to the local 
public school for whatever reason, 
they should not have to. Parents 
have a choice in virtually every-
thing concerning their children ; 
why not education? The govern-
ment has had its chance to educate 
children and it has failed. 

In a few years, when we have 
children of our own, we will have 
the luxury of choice as a result of 
an education system designed to 
benefit us. What about those 
whom the system is designed to 
ignore? Will the government still 
choose for them? Now is our 
chance to ensure that all children 
will have the chance to grow up 
with the opportunities and choices 
they deserve. 

School vouchers take power 
from the few and give it back to 
those from which that power is 
derived: the people.

Industrial and financial companies. 
Why are these people so interested 
in the proliferation of private 
schools? 

One can form many hypothe-
ses. none of them very reassuring. 
and all of them hinging on the 
fact that it is a lot easier for cor-
porations and financial interest to 
int1uence a privately owned. mar-

a public one in which the judg-

Peruvian Army Officer Declares 
Mutiny, President Urged to Quit 

LIMA, Peru - An army lieu-
tenant colonel in command of 60 
soldiers declared a mutiny on 
Sunday in an effort to press 
President Alberto Fujimori to 
resign. The dissident group 
briefly toolc control of a mining 
center. took a general hostage 
and then traveled in a truck and 
a bus toward the remote high-
lands of Puno province. 

The small rebellion began in 
the predawn hours in the south-
ern mining center of Toquepala, 
a few hours after Fujimori 
replaced the commanders of the 
army. navy and air force. The 
shuffling of the high command 
came as efforts by the armed 
forces and the police to seize 
Fujimori's former spy chief, 
V1adimiro Montesinos, contin-
ued without success. 

In a communique, the rebel-
lious Lt. Col. Ollanta Moises 
Humala Tasso said, "I will only 
lay down my .arms when the 
chain of command is legitimate 
and there is a president who has 
been truly elected by the peoRle 
to whom I would be able to 
swear my subordination." 

In a separate radio interview. 
the rebel officer called on other 
members of the armed forces to 
join the rebellion . The young 
officer was joined in the uprising 
by his brother, a retired major 
who was recently forced to leave 
the military. 

There were no immediate

Fujimori to resign for the

reports of violence, and the mili-
tary appeared cautious in react-
ing to the uprising. Military units 
near Toquepala. which is near 
the Chilean border, did not move 
against the dissidents. 

But the military appeared to 
take the threat of a larger mutiny 
seriously. The army commander, 
Gen . Walter Chacon. and Defense 
Minister Carlos Bergamino con-
ferred with Fujimori for several 

hours at the presidential palace 
Sunday, and the army released a 
toughly worded communique 
condemning "the serious break-
down of discipline: 

Military observers said the 
uprising was a sign that many 
middle-ranking officers had long 
been in disagreement with the 
way promotions in recent years 
depended on political connec-
tions to Montesinos and 
Fujimori. 

Members of the opposition 
were quick to distance them-
selves from the revolt. saying 
they wanted a consti tutional 
transition toward new presiden-
tial elections scheduled for April 
8. 

Alejandro Toledo, an opposi-
tion leader who ran against 
Fujimori in elections this year. 
called the uprising "worrisome" 
and "another symptom of the 
discontent" within the armed 
forces. "It is time for President 
Fujimori to resign for the sak~ of 
stability," Toledo added.

Online Retailers Must Find Innovative 
Solutions to Keep Shelves Stocked 

A paradox is emerging in the 
retail world. As the bricks-and-
mortar retailers continue their 
inexorable march toward the vir-
tual store. they are discovering 
that selling on the Web requires 
a lot more bricks and mortar. 

They learned the lessons of 
last year. when many retailers 
were so overwhelmed with holi-
day orders that they ran out of 
stock. Now they are scurrying to 
put their operations in synch 
with their Web sales to try to 
make sure such shortfalls never 
happen again. 

"Retailers who dealt with Web 
sales on a strategic level are final-
ly paying attention to tactics," 
said Mark Borsuk. a retail real 
estate consultant in San 
Francisco. 

Some, like Gap, Nordstrom 
and Kohl's, are putting up new 
buildings to meet delivery needs. 
Others, like Home Depot, are 
making their stores do double 
duty as warehouses and distribu-
tion hubs. And marly, including 
Kmart and Wal-Mart, have farmed 
out the whole process - at least 
temporarily - to so-called fu lfill-

ment houses like Fingerhut, Exel 
and Submitorder.com. which 
store and deliver merchandise for 
retailers. 

In their own ways. the retailers 
are all tackling common prob-
lems. Old distribution centers, 
built to ship pallets loaded with 
the same items to a finite number 
of stores, are ill-equipped to send 
small assortments of items to an 

"Retailers woo dealt 
with Web sales on a 
strategic level are finally

tactics. "

infinite number of dispersed cus-
tomers. In many cases, the people 
on the phones at their customer 
call centers are not trained to 
communicate bye-mail or instant 
messaging. 

Even warehouses geared to 
filling catalog orders are often 

too small or too reliant on anti-
quated order-handling methods 
to process orders in the nanosec-
onds of Internet time . . 

"Internet customers place an 
order. then run to the door to see 
if the UPS truck is there yet," 
said Elaine Rubin . the chair-
woman of Shop.org, a trade asso-
ciation for retailers selling 
online. 

In one sense, the retailers are 
shooting in the dark. Web selling 
is still too new for them to accu'-
rately gauge what items will be in 
demand. and from where. 
Research shows that, for now, 
shoppers most often use retail 
Web sites to research products, 
but then take their s.hopping lists 
to the store. 

Still. those habits could 
Change, as consumers grow more 
comfortable with the Web. and as 
issues of security and delivery are 
ironed out. Jupiter Research pre-
dicts that e-tail sales will reach $9 
billion for November and 
December alone.

ly except in a few areas. If the results 
hold, it is a sign that Kosovo 
Albanians have opted for peace and 
stability and largely rejected the 
thuggery of some of the people who 
assumed powet after last year's war. 

Votes were still being counted 
through the day. and official results 
were not expected until Monday. 
But political parties and indepen-
dent monitoring groups disclosed 
their calculations. The results from 
an independent monitoring group. 
as well as from Rugova's party. the 
Democratic League of Kosovo, 
indicated that the party had won 
broadly and, in particular, in all the 
major towns. 

"Based on preliminary results: 
Rugova said at a neWl> conference 
in Pristina, the province's capital, 
his party won "60 percent of the 
vote throughout Kosovo: 

Rugova declared his determina-
tion to lead Kosovo to indepen-

would protect minorities in

population as well as to Gypsies

School tensipns have

fessors have blocked the hiring of 
black professors for years and have 
resisted the advancement of those 
who have been hired. 

"I did not want to serve as win-
dow dressing to make it seem there 
was a concern for diversity that I 
did not think was present." Nunn 
said. 

After 10 years on the faculty. 
and following the departure of a 
handful of other black professors 
in recent years, unn, 42, is the 
only African-American professor 
teaching this year on a faculty of 
SO. 

Since Nunn's resignation from 
the administration. black profes-
sors who formerly taught at the 
school have described an atmos-
phere of hostility. Some white law 
professors have argued that calls 
for diversity overshadow the need 
to provide basic legal education.

made up the preponderance of 
Kosovo residents. and they had a 
substantial degree of autonomy in 
the Communist era . That was with-
drawn in 1989 after Siobodan 
Milosevic became the Serbian 
leader. and by the late 1990s, the 
Albanians mounted an armed 
rebellion for independence. After 
Milosevic failed to halt what the 
West called horrific atrocities by his 
security forces as they battled the 
rebellion, NATO bombed 
Yugoslavia for 78 days until 
Milosevic agreed to withdraw his 
troops. Since then , the United 

ations has been trying to re-
establish civilian government in the 
province. 

The small remaining population 
of Serbs in Kosovo overwhelmingly 
boycotted Saturday's elections, 
contending that the vote was illegal 
because only the Albanians voted. 

Vojislav Kostunica. who took 
Milosevic's place as Yugoslav presi-
dent earlier this month , issued a 
statement Sunday saying that 
"Yugoslavia cannot recognize the 
results of local erections." 
According to Agence France-
Pre sse. he urged international bod-
ies to carry out the U.N. Security 
Council resolution that governs 
the foreign presence in the 
province. and foresees th at

talks between provincial leaders 
and Belgrade.

Joseph W Little. a white law 
professor and a former mayor of 
Gainesville, has been cri tical of 
what he says are baseless charges. 
calling them " racial 
McCarthyism." He said that he 
supported hiring minority profes-
sors, but that competition for 
them was intense and they were 
someti mes lured away by other 
schools. 

Little argued that proponents 
have continued to press for diversi-
ty at the expense of the school's 
1,200 students. some 300 of whom 
are members of minorities. 

But black law professors who 
have worked here said opponents 
of diversity efforts often claimed 
that no qualified black candidate 
could be found as a way of defeat-
ing such efforts.

professor who now teaches at 
Temple University's law school in 
Philadelphia. saia, for example, that

because the school had been forced 
to hire "affirmative action" profes-
sors.

There â¢â¢ Leads but Still No Answers for u.s. in Cole Bombing 
Investigation According to Government Officials' 

WASHINGTON- Despite a 
trail of clues suggesting that the 
destroyer Cole was bombed by 
Islamic militants possibly associat-
ed with Osama bin Laden. 
American investigators lack the 
concrete evidence to prove any-
thing, administration and govem-
men t officials say. 

Washington is wary of inflam-
ing political turmoil in the Middle 
East by making unsubstantiated 
accusations, the officials say. 

President Clinton has vowed to 
lind and punish those behind the 

attack that killed 17 sailors and 
wounded 39. But investigators say 
that they are being sfowed by 
Yemeni officials' refusal to let 
Americans question scores of peo-
ple detained so far. 

The current investigation has 
been complicated by cultural and 
diplomatic clashes between 
American and Yemeni investiga-
tors. 

Yemeni authorities have so far 
refused to allow investigators to 
directly question suspects or wit-
nesses in Aden, though they have 

The current investigation

cultural and diplomatic 
clashes between American 
and Yemeni investigators, 

allowed the Americans to submit 
questions. 

One official in Washington said 
American investigators have asked 
to question "a couple hundred" 

witnesses. The failure to have 
access to those identified as sus-
pects by Yemen's president,Ali 
Abdullah Saleh. has made it 
impossible for American investiga-
tors to determine their involve-
ment. the official said. 

But evidence collected aboard 
the Cole and elsewhere in Aden -
along with statements by witnesses 
- have provided investigators with 
what several officials here called 
strong leads. 

The information suggests to 
them that the attack was a careful-

ly designed plot carried out by a 
dedicated group. not just the two 
suicide attackers who piloted the 
boat. 

Those involved. the officials 
said. appeared to have been highly 
motivated and disciplined . and 
managed to maintain airtight oper-
ational s~curity as they planned 
and launched their attack from safe 
houses in Aden.

and Halloween 
no pyclmtion Halloween conjures images 

of people dre.ssed as ghouls, ghosts and 
witches. 

Leslie, who reads tarot cards at Psychic 
Eye Bookshops in downtown La Jolla, hap-
pens to be a real-life witch. On Halloween 
she celebrates the traditional pagan holiday 
of Samhain (pronounced sah-wen). 

"Because it is a big party season I usually 
work. When I'm not working I have a reli-
gious ritual," Leslie said. "Samhain was tradi-
tionally the time in which it was believed that 
the dead could communicate most freely 
with the people on Earth." 

On the night of Samhain, Oct. 31, the 
veil between the living world and the dead 
is said to be the thinnest, and "is a very 
strong divination holiday" fo r witches, 
according to Leslie. Samhain "primarily is 
about connecting with [the witches'] sense 
of tradition, our ancestors, our spirit 
guides, the invisible world .... Often there 's 
an offering of food, or something like that 
is left out for the ancestors .. . to let them 
know we're thinking about them: Leslie 
said. . 

Even newcomers to pagan lore can cele-
brate Samhain right here in San Diego, and 
no this does not include sitting at home with 
a Ouiji board. While Samhain celebrations 
may seem scarce compared to the gluttony of 
Haunted Houses on Market Street, Witches' 
Night Out 2000 offers a traditional pagan 
celebration . 

Witches Night Out 2000 is an annual 
ritual, put on by Covenant of the Goddess,

Tor fO f.hIllowmf "'om Several Local Attractions Offer 
Spine-tingling Fun CNARIJE fRAN Sentor Staff Writer 
Haunted house may disappoint but other attractions offer a scare 
By BRENDA XU AND AMY MA 
Contributing Features Writers 

"Be scared and don 't piss your 
pants." 

Those are the rules given at the 
beginning of the tour of the 
Haunted Hotel , located in the 
Gaslamp Quarter at 424 Market St. 
in downtown San Diego. This place 
is one of the many scary spectacles 
in town during the Halloween sea-
son. Although entertaining while it 
lasts, the tour is a mere 15 minutes 
long, which is not worth the 
lengthy wait and the steep $9.95 
admission price. 

The tour begins with a shaky 
elevator ride. setting the mood for 
the chills ahead. Then comes a 
descent into complete darkness, as 
the spectator fumbles through the 
corridors to reach the rooms in the 
hotel. There are re-creations of 
scenes from horror films such as 
"Scream: "The Exorcist: 

. "Nightmare on Elm Street" and 
various others. There are real 
actors portraying characters from 
the : films, staying still until an 
unsuspecting person passes by. 

During the blind walk. chain-
saw-carrying-madmen and other 
nightmarish ghouls frighten and 
chase people. One ofthe rooms has 
a moving floor that shakes the 
spectators as they tear at the walls 
to stay on their feet. Another room. 
which is tilled with optical illusions 
and psychedelic lights. could very 
well resemble an LSD trip. Both 
rooms make. the audience lose their

sense of balance and leave them 
feeling vulnerable to the horrors 
ahead. 

There are more rooms which 
put the observers ill at ease as they 
maneuver around body bags hang-
ing from the ceiling, avoid the grasp 
of a qlged maniac and witness the 
levitation of a possessed woman. 

But those who cannot take the 
jolt of a good scare should pro-
ceed with' caution, so as to avoid a 

ride to the hospital. One unfortu-
nate spectator has already experi-
enced this fate. 

If you have the time and money. 
the Haunted Hotel is a marginally 
enjoyable place to go. 

The negative aspect of the tour 
is that it progresses very quickly. 
which leaves you feeling cheated 
out of the ticket price that could 
have gone towards a couple beers 
at Porter's Pu b.

The Editor's Soapbox 
The National Endowment for the Arts is a worthwile program that should be supported 
By JOSEPH UE 
-1ssociate Hiatus Editor 

Allow me to stand atop this 
:nagnificent soapbox and indulge 
m a moment of shameless self-pro-
motion. or give background infor-
manon. depend ing on whose side 
you are on. 

I play four musical instru-
;nents. I have played the clarinet 
for nearly a decade. I have played 
.he guitar for nearly three years. I 
1 so dabble with the piano and I 
mg, thouah the quality of my 

\ 01Ce may be called into question. 
I own dozens upon dozens of 
CDs, including diverse names 
such as Tricky, Chicane, My 
Bloody Valentine. Depeche Mode, 
Miles Davis and Sasha & 
Digweed . 

I have spent many hours and a 
lot of cash so my band could cut 
live tracks in a recording studio. 
My experience in a recording stu-
dio has to be one of the most 
exhilarating experiences in my 
li fe. 

My mother is a fantastic piano 
player. My father has dabbled with 
the guitar and the trumpet, and he 
also has a wonderful voice. My 13-
year-old sister has been playing the 
violin for many years and has also 
picked up the flute with much 
enthusiasm. 

Music is the perfect friend . 
Music will never turn its back on 
me nor will it stab me in the back. I 
suppose I have an unhealthy 
obsession with all things musical, 
but music has been able to console 
me and lift me out of the low 
points in my life. Beautiful lyrics 

and passionate melodies have been 
able to grab me by the arms and 
drag me forward when [ have fallen 
by the wayside. 

That being said. I hope it has 
become obvious that I have a great 
passion and love for music. It caus-
es me great pain when I see that 
music or any of the arts are being 
neglected, or that funding for the 
arts is the first to be cut. 

There seems to be toO much 
focus in this world on higher test 
scores and making six-tigure 
salaries. Children are being pushed 
to become doctors, lawyers or engi-
neers. It seems rare to me for a par-
ent to tell his children to grow and 
become a rock star or' an artist or a 
fiction writer. I know many people 
regard music and art as mere 
accents on their sparkling college 
transcripts. 

Music, art and other forms of 
creativity must be nurtured at a 
very early age. Studies have shown 
that musically oriented people have 
better study habits and seem to be 
more focused . Music and art must 
not be lost, because they define 
what we are as a society. Currently, 
we are being defined by the 
Backstreet Boys and Britney 
Spears. I find that highly discon-
certing. 

Music, art and writing allow 
people to express themselves out-
side of the confines of an office. 
The arts allow people to express 
feelings about themselves and to 
comment on society in a vibrant 
way. I believe that the arts create a 
well-rounded person, not a selfish. 
career-oriented person who will 
step on anyone to reach the top.

. well-rounded person, not

Ambition makes you look pretty 
ugly. 

That is why we must continue 
to fund and support federally fund-
ed programs such as the National 
Endowment for the Arts.

NEA has been dedicated to help-
ing everyone in the United States. 
Over the decades. the NEA has 
awarded over 111,000 grants in all 
50 states. It has' support~d the 
design of the Vietnam Veterans' 
Memorial, the original production 
of -A Chorus Line" and jazz leg-
ends such as Dizzy Gillespie and 
Miles Davis. 

The NEA has funded thou-
sands of "schools for arts" educa-
tion programs as well as in-school 
and after-school arts programs. 
The EA is currently funding pro-
jects that implement programs to 
help children get involved with 
music in their communities. The 
NEA's ArtsREACH program is 
dedicated to supporting artists, 
musicians and local governments 
in rural areas and small towns to 
ensure that art and music continue 
to represent the culture in these 
places. 

A three-year study of the NEA's 
YouthARTS program has shown 
that arts programs have helped 
lower the delinquency rate among 
youth. This study was sponsored by 
the U.S. Department of Justice and 
was the first to show statistical infor-
mation that offered quantitative evi-
dence on how the arts enhanced the 
development of ~ child and how the 
arts improved behavior and academ~ 
ic perfonmance. 

With a presidential election year 
upon us, I shall provide an interest-
ing bit of information. Upon 
researching the candidates. I found 
a largl! difference in their views on 
the arts. 

On http://www.algore.com I 
searched for "NEA." What I found 

was that the NEA had recom-
mended AI Gore for president due 
to Gore's progressive education 
program. On Irnp:llwww.georgew-
bush.com, 1 had a difficult time find-
ing anything about Bush and the 
NEA. What you get from that bit of 
information is up to you. . 

Here is an interesting compari-
son. 

Over the next four years, the 
United States will spend nearly 
$1.6 trillion on defense. That 
means $1 .6 trillion on bigger and 
bener weapons to kill people faster 
and more efficiently. 

Over the next four years, a 
mere $390 million will be spent 
funding the National Endowment 
for the Arts - a paltry $390 mil-
lion to give children the opportu-
nity to express themselves 
through art and music. A paltry 
$390 million over the next four 
years to promote art and music in 
small towns, inner cities and sub-
urban communities. I find this 
quite troubling. 

Now the part of the soapbox 
where there seems to be some 
wise parting words or a bit of 
advice. 

I urge everyone not to forget 
about how important art is. Go to 
your local museum. Buy paintings 
from local artists. Buy local music. 
Go to jazz shows at small coffee 
shops. Vote. And vote for someone 
who will support art in the schools. 
Find a way to express yourself 
through art or music or writing. 
Discover that creative outlet within 
yourself. You might discover that 
your creative outlet is the best part 
of your day.

A deal that looks sweet on 

Monday could turn sour by 
Tuesday. Wait until Wednesday or 
Thursday to make agreements, in

Alles (March 21-AprIl19) 

On Monday ditching work to 
play isn't a good idea. A significant 
topic requires attention on 
Thesday. The work's pouring in 
from Tuesday through Th\lrsday. 
Follow your partner's lead on 
Friday, but don't take leave of your 
senses. Your good j udgment's 
required all weekend to keep a fun 
time from becoming a fiasco.

On Monday, travel looks like 

fun, but don't ignore an important 
item on your Ii s~. Perfonn perfectly 
under pressure Wednesday, and by 
Thursday you'll have made a prof-
itable impression. Your group can 
get a lot done Friday, but keep it 
confidential. A friend's idea can 
help you make a long shot 
Saturday. Reality could mess with 
your fantasies Sunday, however. 

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 
. - Financial shenan igans could 
leave you sadder but wiser 
Monday. Negotiate and shop 
Tuesday through Thursday. Follow 
instructions on Friday and tum a 
tidy profit. Understanding what 
others want on Saturday may be 
tough. Take it slow and remember 
what you've learned on Sunday.

Speak up if you. disagree on 

Monday. Seek what you want on 
Tuesday, and you're' apt to find it. 
An expectation is unmet 
Wednesday. If you keep pushing, 
it's possible by Thursday. You may 
be swamped Friday, but don't freak. 
You can always come in to work on 
Saturday if you must. Don't work 
on Sunday, though. You're too apt 
to mess things up then .

Tensions at home mar the 
ambiance Monday. Keep .talking 
Tuesday and Wednesday. By 
Thursday die compromise should 
be obvious. Clean house as fast as 
possible Friday so you can play 
from Friday night through 
Saturday. If you don't get too 
rowdy, you'll avoid a fami liar prob-
lem on Sunday. 

Leave dreams of last weekend 
behind on Monday. Tuesday's off 
to a dlfficult start, but a fabulous 
idea pops up later. You may have to 
turn down a child's request 
Wednesday, but heed an older rela-
tive's ad'vice to save money. Play 
wisely Friday. Hide out with your

talk too much. Save the serious QUALITY FOOD â¢ HANDCRAFTED BEER â¢ SUPERIOR SERVICE

Tyler Huff/ Guardian 
FGl.twe"'c David Dos Santos, from the Psych;' Eye BooiI: Shops Inc .. hDIds up seueral 
tmvt cards thaI are used to predict a person's fu ture. 

Tarot: 
Contrary to popular belief, 
psychics do rwt know all 
ConthNed fr_ ,.,. 11 
and took place Saturday at the 
Scottish Rite Center. 1895 
Camino Del Rio So uth . in 
Mission Valley. Nonetheless, 
Samhain rituals are still often difÂ· 
ficult to discover. 

"The pagan community in San 
Diego tends to be pretty loose knit. 
... So there's not a lot of public ritÂ· 
ual in San Diego' Leslie said . 

Another reason that Samhain 
celebrations are not as prevalent as 
trick-or-treating and jack-o-
lanterns is that there are many mis-
conceptions about the holiday. 

"There is no sacrificing of 
babies that goes on,' Leslie said. 
"Nothing spooky and terrible. It is 
much more about connecting with 
our sense of history and our past 
and honoring that, and respecting 
that, and respecting the people 
who have gone before us: 

If spiritual gatherings are not 
your cup of tea, you can still have 
some metaphysical fun this 

. Halloween without leaving the 
posh security of La Jolla. 

At Psychic Eye Bookshops, 
located at 702 Pearl St., readers, 
including Leslie, will gladly deal the 
cards and decipher the runes for 
you . Leslie has been reading Tarot 
Cards since she was 10 years old. 
While attending University of 
Missouri at Columbia, earning her 
degree in journalism, she began 
reading at psychic fairs. She started 
working at Psychic Eye when she 
moved to San Diego in 1996. 

Like the celebration of 
Samhain, fortune telling is also vic-
tim to many misconceptions. 

"I cannot immediately access all 
information that is relevant to every 
single person's life just by looking at 
them' Leslie joked "There are a lot 
of misconceptions about what we 
do and what we are capable of doing 
.. . just because you go to see a psy-
chic and you get a lS-minute read-
ing, that does not mean that they 
can channel your dead grandmoth-
er; that does not mean they can give 

â¢ you the exact time and place of your 
death. There are some things that 
are not very feasible. ~nicularly in a 
short period of time. -

There is also a difference 
between psychics and tarot card 

readers. "Psychics can use any 
number of different methods ... 
Leslie said. "Some of them will just 
read intuitively ... some of them 
work with tarot, some of them work 
with runes, some of them work with 
numerology or astrology." 

Most professional fortunetellers 
use a combination of methods. If 
you have your heart set on a partic-
ular type of reading, make sure you 
let your reader know before hand. 

It is important to find a trust-
worthy reader. Lesl ie warns people 
about phone psychiCS because "the 
vast majority of them, in my perÂ· 
sonal experience, are unreliable," 
she said. 

Wicca, paganism and divination 
are often lumped together under the 
generic title "new age." However, 
unlike witchcraft, tarot and other 
forms of divination "are not reli-
gious or spiritual systems per se .... 
They are not a faith or a spiritual 
practice in the same sense that 
witchcraft or wicca is." Leslie said. 

If insight into your life and the 
decisions you make is what you are 
interested in , a tarol card reading 
may be just what you are looking 
for. But of course Â·if you are con-
fused about what classes to take 
next quarter, you should stick with 
Academic Advising. 

So, if you are disappointed with 
the same old Halloween parties and 
VH-l rerunning the "Rocky Horror 
Picture Show,' remember there is a 
lot more to Halloween than face Â· 
makeup and "The Monster Mash: 

Like Santa Clause, Disneyland 
and the Easter Bunny, Halloween 
loses some of its magic with the 
passing of childhood . But hope-
fully discovering its ancient her-
itage will revive its mystique. No 
matter how you celebrate this 
Halloween - the modern or the 
old way - happy haunting and 
blessed bel

Volleyball goes against 
Stanislaus and Bakersfield 
Continued from pal. 24 

The inspired play that UCSD 
exhibited in the second set soon 
ran out, however, and it went on to 
drop the final two sets 15-9 and 
15-8. 

Saturday night it just was not 
there for the Blue and Gold, as it 
was out-hit by visiting Bakersfield 
at a 0.213 to 0.035 clip. This defeat 
marked the first loss of the season 
at RIMAC Arena for the Tritons. 

Standout efforts for the lhtons 
ca me courtesy of Laura Sinter, who 
had 16 kills and 16 digs on the 
night. Punnelli also had a solid 
night with eight kills and 14 digs, 
while Jessica Baner was hooking 
up her teammates all night , picking 
up 34 assists. 

With the split over the weekend, 
the Tritons' record stands at 14-3 
in CCAA play and 20-5 overall. 

Soccer: 
Tritons post a 2-0 
record over the weekend 
continued from p â¢â¢ 24 
overall and 10-4 in league play. 
The win for UCSD bumped its 
record to 14-2 overa ll and 12-2 in 
league play. 

The Broncos and the Tritons 
will meet again on Nov. 2 in the 
semifinal round of the four-team 
tournament to decide the CCAA 
championship. 

The Tritons returned home on 
Saturday to face the Crusaders of 
Point Loma Nazarene. 

A partisan crowd of just over 
1,000 people showed up to watch 
UCSD wrap up its regular season, 
and even though the game was not 
a league game it still had playoff 
implications, and there was some 
good action on the field as the 
Tritons defeated the Crusaders 1-

UCSD next heads out to 
Phoenix where it will lock horns 
with Grand Canyon University in

postseason ramifications. It will 
then return home for a two-game

topple CSU Dominguez Hills and

By winning their last games the 

Tritons assure that they will be

ment and have had a superb sea-
son in their freshman year in 
Division II. 

Pearlman: 
Only college athletics

ting they had made a multi-million-
dollar mistake. 

No - first the coaches wiII be 
fired, and then the manager, and 
then maybe the superstar will be 
traded for a couple hundred thou-
sand less than what he was earning. 

College athletes, on the other 
hand, are quite aware of the fact 
that they can be replaced any time. 
They are reminded every day that 
someone is sitting on the bench 
behind them, waiting for the 
opportunity to prove they can start. 
The staners in COllege play their 
hearts out every day in or~er to 
ensure they'll be playing tomorrow. 

I encourage all the readers to go 
out and watch some college athletic

emotion, blood, tears and most 
importantly, hem.

the ball park or to the television or 
radio to catch the game. 

If that was not the case, school 
kids and workers would sneak in 
radios to quietly listen to the action 
transpiring somewhere on a magi-
cal diamond. 

Some schools and work places 
would go as far as to broadcast the 
World Series itself over intercoms. 
This is how big the Series was. It 
was practically a national holiday. 

Am I advocating children skip-
ping school and adults leaving 
work to watch a game? Yes I am. 
Am I suggesting that the World 
Series should sit right next to math 
and history at school and to meet-
ings and clients in the work place? 
Again, yes. 

The World Series is tradition. It is 
as American as apple pie. Why must 
these traditions be smothered? 

Baseball needs to look at itself 
in the mirror and realize what it is 
doing to itself and its fan base. The 
Series used to be something so 
special that the nation would shut 
down just to watch. Now sleepy-
heads with things to do the next 
day fall off to dreamland, only to 
witness special memories on thr 
next day's highlight show.

Cal Poly Pomona Sours 
UCSD's Winning Streak Greed and Avarice Rule Our Sports World With an Open Pocketbook 
Senior Broncos score two in the first half, 
Tritons take on Sonoma State next week 
IJAlMJeAUN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
rode into the Cal Poly Pomona 
match on a hot streak, unbeaten in 
its last eight matches. 

The Broncos came into Â·the 
match with a record of 7-8-3 over-
all and 4-6-3 in league play. The 
Thtons were 11-2-2 overall, and 9-

halftime, and UCSD's Daniel 
Appel ~me out and scored an early 
second-half goal to make things 
interesting. 

From then on, no team found 
the net, and the game ended 2-1. 
The Thtons only had three shots 
on goal, compared to eight by the 
Broncos. 

~We were all off." said Thton 
midfielder Sean Summers. "We 

2-2 in league 
play. 

With the loss 
of Thton mid-

well, the outcome was not good for 
the 1titons. Pomona prevailed in a 
dose 2-1 game to end league play 
matches for the 2000 season. 

Pomona scored early, with two 
goals within the first 10 minutes of 
play. John Picco found the net first, 
and a Pacual Villegas goal was 
assisted by Theo Hetherington to 
break things open. 

The game was 2-0 going into 

The Tritons finished with a 
league record of 11-3-2. This sets 
them up as either a No.2 or No. 3 
seed in the CCAA Championships 
beginning Nov. 2. 

UCSD will play on Nov. 3 
against Sonoma State, a team the 
Tritons lost to earlier this season. 
The winner will then go on to face 
the CCAA favorite, the first-ranked 
CSU Dominguez Hills. 

Stoner 
Steps 

ISAAC PEARLMAN 

I have a confession to make. I have become disillusioned with professional sports. An 
avid baseball fan, I didn't watch 
one game of the World Series. I 
haven't watched a whole pro 
football .game this year. Heck, I 
barely watch ~Sports Center" 
anymore. 

It's not because I see football 
players in the news more than I 
see them on the field, not because 
I couldn't stand to see those 
damn Yankees win their thou-
sandth championship, and cer-
tainly not because I'm busy doing 
interesting things. and don't have 
the time. It's because [ can't make 
myself watch two' characterless 
teams stumble against each other 
to win more money. 

Back in the day, the extra cash 
the players earned from winning a 
championship used to mean 
something. The athletes all want-
ed that money in order buy a 
house. a car or to invest it. 

Nowadays the players can 
find championship-caliber cash 
buried in their couches. When 
the average baseball player makes 
arou!ld $1 million a year, an extra 
couple thousand is nothing. 

After being fined for the Piazza 
fiasco, Roger Clemens probably 
lost money in the World Series. . 
Yet the players still strive for it, 
which reveals the greed and 

avarice of professional sports. 
The Yankees aren't a team; 

they're a collection of mercenaries 
hired by the manager to win at all 
costs. The money cycle perpetu-
ates itself, so the richest team in 
baseball wins more money to wal-
low in, while the small-market 
teams fall even funher behind. 

An examination of individual 
players does not present much 
hope. The players, especially the 
superstars, are important because 
they represent the team. It's 
almost as if the media has realized 
that the tenns ~Yankee: "Padre." 
"Charger: orÂ· Laker" have lost all 
meaning. Sure. there's the history 
of each franchise, but with ath-
letes hopping from one team to 
another each year, it's practically 
impossible for a team to establish 
an identity. 

I mean, look at the NBA -
practically half the league got 
traded this year. Overnight, the 
Orlando Magic became a force to 
be re.ckoned with by acquiring 
Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady, 
while the mediocre teams got 
even worse. 

These athletes. instead of dif-
ferentiating themselves from the 
ownj:rs, have subscribed to their 
system. With a few notable excep-
t!ons. most pros have sold their 
pride for pieces of green paper. 

Instead of focusing on the 
sports they play, pro athletes 
today are concerned with more 
than just the game. The most bla-
tant example of this is the com-
mercials athletes make. Tum on 
the TV and they're in ads fo r 
soup, dot-com companies, even 
real estate. 

These commercials have 
absolutely no point other than to 
garner humor by showcasing the 
athlete's terrible acting skills. I 
could understand if the athletes 
needed money, but when the 
league minimum salary is a cou-
ple hundred thousand, I'm pretty 
sure the athletes aren't strapped 
for cash. 

Some pros have even dabbled 
in the fields of music and acting, 
which I can't understand. I'll 
admit, some of them have real tal-
ent (some have no talent), but if 
they are good enough to be bored 
with their sport, then they 
shouldn't be among the privi-
leged few allowed to playa profes-
sional spor.t for a career. 

So where do you go to see ath-
letes chasing dreams and glory, 
instead of dollar bills? Why. you 
have to look no funher than col-
lege teams. While big colleges 
have begun to focus on individu-
als as well, they still remain more 
team oriented than the profes-
sional leagues. 

These athletes aren't con-
cemed with big contracts. nor try-
ing to fulfill incentives - in fact, 
quite the opposite. They use 
sports as an outlet to retreat from 
the pressures of class and social 
life, while the pros have no such 
concept. 

Whether you believe it, COllege 
athletes have more of an incentive 
than pros to play hard. Multi-mil-
lionaire superstars know they will 
not be benched no matter how 
badly they play, since it will be 
equivalent to the franchise admit-

Can Anyone 
Stay Awake 
For Baseball? 

F lton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

T he World Series came to its less-than-stunning conclu-sion last week when the 
New York Yankees unceremoni-
ously disposed of the cross-town 
rival Mets, four games to one. 

This was the Bronx Bombers' 
fourth title in five years and their 
26th overall. Well, whoop dee 
freakin' doo. 

There is something wrong with 
the World Series today, and it does 
not lie only with the Yankees win-
ning and the buying of another title 
by a big-market club. No, it is more 
fundamental than that. 

The starting and finishing times 
for the World Series are ridiculous. 
On the East Coast, the games begin 
any time between 8 p.m. and 8:30 
p.m. and don't finish until well 
after midnight. 

Over here it is not so bad, with 
everything three hours earlier. but 
for the area where the teams are 
actually located, it is amazingly late. 

Now, for people like us. college 
studen ts who are used to la te 
IlIghts and weird time schedules. 
w ding a game after midnight is no 
biggee. The problem with this 
game schedule is for the young-
sters. What are the children to do? 

Youngsters can 't stay up past 
midnight watching baseball. I 
mean, elementary school students 
need their rest and have bedtimes 
well before the game is over 
because they must be at school the 
next day. They can't, or at least 
shouldn't, be staying up until the 
next day. 

That includes the many watch-
ing. the games on television. What 
about those who actually make it to 
a game? Say a contest ends at 
12:30 a.m. After the drive home 
and everything, it would be 2 a.m. 
before Junior hits the sack. 

Yeah, give a 9-year-old five 
hours of sleep, I'm sure he'll be 
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the 
next day, ready to learn. 

Baseball is killing itself in his 
,ISpeCI. It isn't appealing to youth . It 

oes not affect the children out 
here so much, but the young 
Yankees and Mets fans ' only mem-
ories of the game will come from 
"Sports Center" the next day. 

I think that baseball should go 
back to the way it was and have 
World Series games start in the 
afternoon. This is the way it was fo r 
many years, well before lighted sta-
diums made nighttime games pos-
sible Jnd fat television contracts 
dictated which direction the insti-
tutions should take. 

Yes, children had school and 
adults had work during the games, 
but certain things would mysteri-
ously take place when the World 
peries came about. 

School kids would come down 
with some sort of cold the day of a 
game. Parents with jobs would all 
of a sudden have some family mat-
ters to take care of at home just 
before the time of the fi ru pitch. 

In other words, children would 
ditch and working people take the 
day off from their jobs to head to

I Tritons Triumph, Win CCAA 
Women's soccer team pummels Cal Poly Pomona, 3-1 
By TAIl MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Tritons' women's soccer team walked 
all over Cal Poly Pomona on Friday night 3-1, 
then came home to defeat Point Lorna 
Nazarene 1-0 in a real squeaker on Saturday. 

The Cal Poly game was to decide the 
California Collegia te Athletic Association 
championship. Both teams were al ready 
assured of meeting in the first round of the 
playoffs, and this ga me was fo r bragging 
rights. 

With a win, Cal Poly could claim a share of 
the CCM championships. With a Triton loss, 
UCSD could be in jeopardy of losing its No.1 
ranking in the upcoming CCM tournament. 

UCSD came into the game fi ring on all 
cylinders wi th no intention of lett ing Pomona 
share its title. and within 50 seconds of the 
whistle blowing, the Tritons alre~dy had a 1-0 
lead over the Broncos. 

UCS D's Laura Dooly scored the first goal 
off a corner kick from teammate Jul ia Cuder. 

A scant two minutes later; UCSD increased 
its lead to 2-0 on a beautiful 22-yard kick from 
Cuder. 

At this point in time the Tritons, up 2-0, 
and only three minutes into the match, hit a bit 

. of a slow spot, at least offensively. 
For the next 40 minutes of the game, UCS D 

and the Broncos traded stabs and jabs into 
each other's territories to no avail. 

However, at,the 42-minute mark, Ca l Poly 
finally gOt on the board with a goal by Michelle 
McConnel. 

UCSD, like the fifth-ranked team it is, did 
not let the goal affect it, and 10 minutes later 
Cindy Dostalek scored on an assist from 
Cuder to extend the lead back to two, going up 
3-1, to cap scoring for the rest of the game. 

"The game against Cal Poly was 100 miles 
per hour the whole game," said head coach 
Brian McManus. 

Cuder had a great game for the Tritons and 
was involved in all three Triton scores with two 
assists and one goal. 

Pomona's loss dropped its record to 14-4

The Tri tons' eagerly anticipated 
homestand fe ll slightly short of 
expectations this weekend as they 
split a pair of Californ ia Collegiate 
Athletic Association matches. 

RIMAC Arena hosted the two 
fie rce conference showdowns. 
which pitted UCSD against Cal 
State University StanislausÂ· on 
Friday night, and Cal State 
University Bakersfield on Saturday. 

Friday night, the Tritons thor-
oughly dominated the visiting 
Warriors of Stanislaus, sweeping 
them in three games. The most dif-
ficult set was the first. as the two 
teams went all the way down to the 
wire before the Tritons could finish 
Stanislaus off 15-13 and avoid 
extra points. 

The next set saw a more com-
posed UCSD meticulously dis-
mantle the Warriors, taking the 
game 15-9. From there on out, it 
was easy sailing as the Stanislaus 
squad folded like a Tyson oppo-
nent, essentially packing it in and 
allowing the Tritons to waltz away 
with a 15-4 third-game victory and 
the match as well. 

Dianne Camarillo led the way 
for the Blue and Gold, co'mpiling a 
match-high 10 kills. Leslie Punnelli 

also had a strong showing Friday 
night, notching 16 digs in the 
effort. Jennie Wilson added to the 
barrage, chipping in with eight 
kills. while teammates Shannon 
Hawes and Kathleen Kentz had 
seven kills apiece. 

The vanquished Warriors were 
led by the play of Angie Tribble, 
who picked up eight ki lls and 12 
digs in the loss. 

The Tritons came out Saturday 
night looking for more of the same 
polished play that had netted them 
the sweep the night before. It was 
not in the cards, however, as CSU 
Bakersfield overpowered UCSD, 
taking the match in four sets. 

Perhaps it was fatigue, or maybe 
tht: players were looking forward to 
donning their outfits for some 
trick-or-treating Thesday night, but 
for one reason or another the 
Tritons could not get it together in 
this match. 

They faltered early on, losing 
the first set 15-12 before giving 
their most heartfelt performance of 
the night in the second game. 
Down 12-4, they rallied back and 
then fell behind again 14-12. The 
Tritons would not back down, 
though, and took it to extra points 
to win the set 16-14.
