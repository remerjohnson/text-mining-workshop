Beneath the urface of this sprawling, 
quiet campu lie a two-mile network of dar k, 
musty corridor. To 'ome students, the e 
tunnels ar a deep mystery, hrouded in 
ecrecy by a deviou and diabolical campu ' 

admini I ration. 
The e student will ay that the tunnel 

are used by a small , elite roup of profes ors 
to conduct ecret re ' arch. Or perhaps they 
will say that the tunnels were built for th 
Marine during th turbulent '60 , in ca e 
they were needed to storm a riot-torn campus. 

Other tudent will : ay that the tunnel 
are ju t a good way to break into campus 
building -laboratorie ,in particular - and 
to steal an a 'ortm nt of valuable . 

Campus official ', h w ver, warn that the 
tunnel are ext rem ly dang rou and should 
be re tricted to only a select few. 

And, as everal members of the Guardian 
discovered rec ntly, the tunn I ' elaborate 
o y tern of bolt ·, lock, chain, bar and si lent 

alarms erve a a very effective deterrent to 
would-be 'tourists' and bring campu police 
running quickly to the scene. 

The dozen or 0 facilitie manag ment 
employees and campu police \vho have the 
on ly free access to the tunnel are generally 
tight-lipped about their underworld domain 
and jealou ly guard entrance to the tunnels. 
It was onl . after much haggling and cajoling 
that th Guardian got permi sion to re-enter

Nemo sees graffiti 
as social activity 
Editor: 

While the article on UCSD 
graffiti (Guardian, May 28) is 
still fresh in everyone's mind, 
I would like to explain more 
about wall-writing and 
present some questions to its 
opponents. I am Nemo; [have 
been a wall-writer for two 
years now. Of course what I 
say is. my opinion only -

. other writers might have 
different interpretations -
but I have been part of the 
walls long enough to have an 
excellent feel for what it is. 
Graffiti is a dynamic process; 
it takes observation over a 
period of time to understand 
It - a single look captures too 
little of its diversity. 

First, I want to clear up 
something that appeared in 
Paul Farwell's article. I 
supposedly said that we 
didn't want graffiti from 
people who didn't under-
stand us. I don 't recall saying 
exactly that, but if I did, it's 
not what I meant. Actuallr, 
the people who don t 
understand us are the least 
likely to write. Besides, we're 
not a cliquish group with 
exclusive membership. Each 
of us was the 'new kid' at one 
'point in our career. We each 
saw what was there, was 
intrigued or otherwise 
motivated and so began to 
write_ Any of you might reach 
the same conclusion and 
become a writer yourself. I 
am against 'potty poetry' 
(like that often found in 
bathrooms) and thin~s like 
'lohn was here," - [ m not 
against people whose writing 
isn't a clone of what's already 
there. I also feared that 
publicity might bring an 
Influx of tourists - people 
just looking - which is fine, 
except that they can scare the 
shit out of you when you're 
writing. Since the university 
has deemed wall-writing 
illegal, we're very wary a bout 
being cau~ht. 

This bn~s me to t he main 
point of thIS paper - the 
questions I wish to raise to 
wall-writing's opponents. I 
can understand people who 
have no inclination to either 
read it or write it, but I have 
great difficulty understand-

ing those who wish to 
eradicate it. What wrong 
does graffiti do? I cannot see 
our wal1-writin~ as being 
bad: I see its Illegality as 
being arbitrary. By arbitrary 
I mean that it is not morally 
wrong, but that someone just 
decided that it was illegal. 
For example, jaywalking is 
against the law, but I find 
nothing ethically wrong in 
doing it. To me, wall-writing 
is the same thing. I can see 
where graffiti per se could be 
defacement - on the outside 
of buildings, "so-and-so was 
here," pointless obscenities 
- but ours is much more 
than that. I'm no more 
pleased with phallic 
drawings captioned by "eat 
me" than those Linguistics 
grad students are. However, 
things like that are in the 
minority, and if that's all our 
opponents see, then they are 
truly blind. 

So what harm is done by us 
covering the walls with our 
words? I'll first consider the 
issue from the point of view 
of the average student (if 
there is one). From what I've 
heard in passing conversa-
tions, at parties and such, the 
students here don't mind it. 
Some are interested, some 
are disinterested, but none 
seem to have a real 
preference for blank yellow 
walls. Interestingly, after 
P&L was repainted (an 
incredible waste) at least six 
independent comments 
appeared from apparent 
readers, bemoaning the loss 
of the graffiti and stati ng 
their hope for its return. I've 
also met people in the 
stairwells who've expressed 
their delight in it. We have 
regular readers, along with 
the regular writers. 

From our point of view, the 
graffiti is obviously 
marvelous. We (and I say 'we' 
with confidence because 
we've discussed it before) 
find a sort of magic up there 
in the Towers. It brings out 
the 'wildness,' the 'night 
madness' - our names for a 
feeling of tremendous energy 
and creativity and something 
else that just can't be put into 
words. Wall-writing is a truly

. social activity. Part of what 
distinguis hes our writing 
from street graffiti is the fact 
that it is written with the 
idea of replies being mad. We 
discussed things, write 
poetry , have running 
conversations. (Lest you 
think us too serious, we also 
write pure nonsense 
sometimes.) If no one ever 
answered, I don't think most 
of us would writeat all. In the 
course of these interactions, 
we have come to know 
everyone else; we ca ll 
ourselves a family. (We are 
not the first family, however. 
We have a history extending 
back - as far as we know -
to 1974. I understand that 
P&L was built in 1972, thus 
it seems that as long as there 
has been P&L there has been 
graffiti.) 

So far I ha ve found no harm 
done. On the contrary I see 
much positive feeling 
resulting from wall-writing. 
Lastly I turn to our 
opponents, mostly univecs;ty 
employees and grad students, 
it seems. From what I've 
heard, they seem to find it 
offensive because of 
obscenity and just the fact 
that it's there (it's 
embarrassing - not in good 
academic taste, or some· 
thing). Well, as I said before, 
the obscenity is not part of 
our writing, and it's 
definitely in t he minority. As 
for the second statement -
isn't creativity a vital part of 
real academia and an 
intellectual atmosphere? I 
certainly think so, and 
creativity is a cornerstone or 
two or three of the wall-
writing foundation. Have any 
of you (our opponents) really 
stopped and read the graffiti? 
I think not. Are you opposed 
to it because it's "deviant"? 
Can't you tolerate a single 
element in your midst that's 
different ? Can't you see all 
that you destroy when you 
paint over the walls? Can't 
you see how futile it is - we 
shall always return . 
Obviously not. I see no hope 
for you. You cannot recognize 
things of value that are not 
officially acceptable, and 
perhaps not even things t hat 
are. Go ahead and worship 
your prized sterility - I will 
continue to create, write and 
live. 

I'm growing emotional, so l 
will stop before I really start 
to rant and rave. I hope I have 
made all of you, e peci all y our 
opponents, stop and think, at 
lea t for a little while. 
Perhaps you will vi it the 
walls and find the magic 
(excuse the bare condition in 
P&L - we're working on it!). 
I hope you find the magic 
somewhere. The Towers call 
me; I return . Farewell.

Sex column needs 
better Q's and A's 
Editor: 

There are many questions 
among this college popula-
tion regarding birth control, 
sexuality and reproductive 
health. Your "Between the 
Sheets" column could be a 
highly effective means of 
disseminating some valu-
able, much needed informa-
tion. Instead, I see columns 
that are disorganized , 
irrelevant and misleading. 
According to the column , 
men with "pimples" on their 
penis should .automatically 
assume they have herpes, 
"withdraw)' is something 
that requires much control 
by men (but what is it?) and 
one of the most pressing 
concerns of women is 
confusion between dysmen-
orrhea and gonorrhea. 

Where do these questions 
and answers come from? 

More relevant concerns of 
this college population 
include questions about 

effective birth- control, 
relationships and sexuality. 
These include questions like: 
Do I need to have sex to keep 
my girl/boy friend? Am I 
gay/lesbian and, if so, what 
dol do? Is my penis too short? 
When I date someone do [ 
have to have sex? What 
constitutes a rape situation? 
What do I do if I am raped, I 
get pregnant, my partner gets 
pregnant, 1 want birth 
control, I have personal 
questions I want answers to, 
I have never had an orgasm or 
I ejaculate too soon? Am I 
normal if I don't want sex 
right now, if I am sexually 
attracted to someone of my 
own sex or if I have irregular 
periods? 

Now that you have this 
column, it would be much 
more valuable if whoever 
writes it would concern him-
or herself with more relevant 
problems. 

Andy Smith 

Arts critic ought 
to review cartoons 
Editor: 

Throughout this past year 
I have attended many on-
camplls events which include 
drama (from Thurber II 
through American Buffalo), 
lect ures (from Germaine 
Greer through Robert 
Hughes), and also various off-
campus movies (from The 
Elephant Man through 
Atlantic City). After 
attending these events or 
films I have often read a 
Guardian reporter's subse-
quent review of those same 
event s or films. The 
numerous lamentable 
reviews can be tolerated as 
long as we are relieved by the 
occasional rarity of a decent, 
intelligent review (such as 
the review of the Robert 
Hughes lecture). But after 
seeing the film Breaker 
Moranl last Saturday and 
then reading Mike Thomas' 
review of that same film 
(Guardian, May 28), my 
feelings of revulsion have 
become so unbearable that 
pen mu t be taken in hand to 
addre the Editor. 

Mr. Thomas seems to be 
one of those rare, enlightened 
film-going individuals who 
nod off at the first sign of 
dialogu (thereby revealing 
his own negative attention 
pan). Thoma~ treat the 

rather di turbing moral 
implication of thi film a 

imply another reason to 

yawn. To him, obviously, no 
film is praiseworthy unless it 
contains at least one ·car · 
chase/rape/murder/mutila-
tion/seduction scene -
preferably multiples of each. 

Even more interesting 
(from a newspaper editor's 
point of view) is the "mini 
review" of the same film on 
the previous page. In the 
"Check It Out" section of the 
''This Week at the Movies" 
page the anonymous 
reviewer states: "Everything 
- the technical aspects, the 
script, the acting - comes 
together to make this the best 
movie of the year; so far." 
Indeed , this is quite a 
contrast to Mr. Thomas' 
tranqulizer approach on the 
very next page. 

I consider myself fortunate 
for having seen Breaker 
Morant before reading this 
review, for Mr. Thoma is 
guilty of Film Reviewer's 
Crime No. 1: Do not reveal the 
complete outcome of the film! 
No reviewer with any 
consideration - let alone 
journalistic flair - spoils the 
pleasure of eeing a film by 
blabbing out its conclusion. I 
would suggest that Mr. 
Thomas be teassigned to 
review only that audiovisual 
art more suitable to his 
intelle "tual capacity -
perhap " aturday morning 
canoon .

DC's affirmative action efforts are 'meager'

Crew team always 
receives bad press 
Editor: 

In hopes of con oling the 
hard-working and, obviously , 
quite successful UCSD 
crews, please allow me these 
remarks. 

In 1977 I returned to 
California after my introduc-
tion to crew and four years of 
succcessful competition on 
an east coast intercollegiate 
crew. I can only say that the 
pres on the west coast can't 
hold a candle to it east coa t 
counterpart vis -a -vis 
coverage of rowing. probably 
becau e it generally doesn't 
know enough about crew to 
do it justice in reporting on it. 

On a national level, the 
same is true for Sports 
Illustrated, to whom I wrote a 
letter about crew in 1976. All 
the media largely ignore a 
sport that ha a huge 
national following (mostly 
participants - not merely 
spectators) and that harbors 
rivalries as keen or keener 
than those in any other sport. 
The magazine did not print 
my letter. 

So, UCSD oar men and .

treated no wor e by the pre

"We don't like to go down 
there any more than we have 
to," says Creighton Steele, 
superintendant of building 
operations. Waving aside 
rumors of underground 
clandestine activity with a 
laugh, Steele is Quick to warn 
repeatedly that the tunnels 
are far from safe. 

The primary danger of the 
tunnels, Steele and other 
officials say, is the threat of 
leakage from the hot water 
pipes. "We keep them under 
control with press ure ," 
Steele explains. "If any ofthe 
pipes were to suddenly break, 
(the pressurized hot water) 
would immediately expand 
and flash into steam." 

Such a leak forced the 

closure for several days of a 
long stretch of tunnel 
underneath the Bonner Hall 
area several years ago_ Noone 
was in the tunnel at the time 
and there were no injuries, 
but Steele and others warn 
that such a leak could occur 
again without warning. In 
fact, the tunnels endure 
constant, small leaks, that 
are repaired by maintenance 
workers who inspect the 
entire tunnel system weekly. 
Thick, extra insulat ion 
padding is wrapped around

tudent with access to the campus tunnel system. At a 

weight of approximately 200 pounds, the covers are 
extremely difficult to raise. In at leas t one case, in fact, a 
student has severed part of a finger after accidentally 
dropping a manhole cover. Still, campus officials have taken 
precautions against intruder by chaining many manhole 
covers down to an inside rung.

The Underground 
cOl1t inu l' d from page 6 
attempt to keep up with 
stu den ts, who seem to 
always find a way to get in. 

Ever ince the uni vers ity 
installed ilent alarm to the 
top of over half of the door 
leading into or within the 
tunnel . tudents with s tolen 
keys or tools have been 
unable to break in the 'easy 
way.' Undaunted , omeofthe 
more ambitious intruders 
have cut through expandable 
metal door _ Others have 
crawled along narrow metal 
trays used to carry telephone 
lines in order to get from one 
tunnel section to another. 
(Each section is partitioned 
off by a door. ) Still other 
have squeezed, like rats, 
t hrough small drainage 
pipes, while other tudents 
have pried open 2oo-pound 
manhole covers to climb 
down. (Earlier this year an 
undergraduate severed off a 
finger when he accidentally 
dropped a manhole cover.) 
Students have even removed 
entire doors and "busted 
through sheet metal" to get 
into the tunnels, according to 
Steele_ 

The only thing UCSD 
officials can do, they say , is to 
keep increasing security. 
Now, many manhole covers 
are chained to an inside rung, 
and expandable metal door 
are reinforced by thick steel 
ba r . Ba r cover d rain 
open ings of all ize, and 
block off acces to telephone 
tray . In fact , ju t about 
every po sible opening or 
orifice in the tunnels has 
been sealed off. 

"And they still get in, " 
moans Steele. "You know as 
well as I do, that if there's a 
will there's a way." 

His pronouncemen t is 

echoed by at least one sl ud nt 
tunnel-goer, who says the 
ecurity pr 'aution "really 

pre ent no problem," for 
tudents who take the time to 
tudy the tunnel sy tern a bit. 
Like a majority of the 

student who break into the 
tunnel , the tudent say the 
"challenge" of getting in ha 
attracted him to t he tunnels. 
" It' just an interest ing place 
where there are no other 
people." And why are the 
tunnel s int eres ting? " Be-
cau 'e they're restricted," he 
state mat ter-of -fact ly. 

The tunnel are not unique 
to thi s campu s. Many 
universitie have opted for 
this type of utility network , 
over the choice of much 
smaller, underground utility 
conduits. Some campu es in 
the colder northern and 
eastern states, in fact, allow 
students and other members 
of the campus to walk to and 
from classes in the warm 
corridors during the winter. 
And until this year , .UCSD 
students were offered tours 
of the tunnels in an effort to 
'demystify' the underground 
network. 

But the man responsible 
for the tunnel tours has left 
UCSD, and his successor, 
Steele, is "not abou t to give 
publ ic tour of them," he 
says . He worries t ha t 
pu blicity of the tun nel 
wou Id only encourage 
further break·in . 

Wh at happens to the 
unfortunate few students 
who a re caugh t in the 
tunnels? 

"Each case is handled on 
its own merits," says Lloyd 
Turner, a campus police 
lieutenant He explains that 
students caught only with 

pl";I'" 11I1'1I1"1'.lgI· \O 

Hot water pipes are especiallr vulnerable to .leaks at 
"expandable jOints," which prOVIde the water ',Vlth extra 
space to expand and prevent pipes from swaYing under 
Ouctuating pressures. Whe!, ruptures in th~ joint~ occur, 
they are wrapped with additional layers of IOsulation. If a 
major leak occured, the pressurized, .400.dell!"ee F water 
would immediately expand and Dash Into seannll steam.

A trip 
under 
campus 

continued from page 7 
break-in tools would be 
charged differently than 
students caught with stolen 
material _ And if a student is 
caught with nothing? "It's 
pretty hard to charge a 
student with tre passing on 
this campus," Turner quips_ 
One of the most serious 
break-in cases campus police 
can recall surrounds the 
illegal installation of "blue 
boxes" and "black boxes," 
two similar, innocuous-
looking metal boxes that 
scramble telephone charges 
and allow unlimited free 

long~istance telephone calls 
throughout the world. 
Campus police have also 
investigated several thefts 
that resulted from gaining 
building access through the 
tunnels. But thus far, no 
damage to the utility lines 
within the tunnels has been 
reported. 

"There's a lot of possibili-
ties for disabling the 
university," admits one 
student who asked to remain 
unidentified. Communica-
tions systems, in particular , 
could be an easy target for 
anyone who ha gained 
access to the tunnel _ But the 
student maintain that such 
an incident i unlikely to 
occur. "I think that the 
people who are skilled 
enough to break in are not 
vandals," he says. 

Were the tunnels really 
created for the Marines? Is 
secret research actually 
conducted underground? 
Campus architect Chuck 
Powers is amused by the 
rumors. "The tunnels are 
like a closet with all the 
clothes in it and one lightbulb 
- very hot," he laughs_ 
"Research is very sophisto-
cated these days ... there's no 
research in the tunnels at 
all." And as for the Marines, 
"No one in their right mind 
would put troops down 
there," Power says. 

Powers admits that the 
university is "a lillie 
paranoid" about the tunnels 
(student injuries could result 
in a lawsuit against UCSD) 
but maintains that "there's 
nothing secret about them." 

There is little doubt that 
students will continue to 
enter the tunnels regardless 
of the ingenui ty of security 
measures. But while these 
students will crawl and 
squeeze and sweat to get in, 
two UCSD undergraduates 
will enter t he tunnel s 
legiti mate ly and with 
comparative dignity. They 
have been hired by the 
university to scrub down the 
entire tunnel system, pipes 
and all . Their work is tedious 
and slow; after having 
worked on their task since 
last fall, a large amount of 
dirty , graffittied tunnel still 
remains.

Concerts/ Sid Corbett 

THE: Amazing and ridiculous at once 
Avant-garde is a term I 

tend to avoid. As Pauline 
Oliveros observes, "it's a 
mili tary term. " Yet there lies 
in the mere mention of 
'avant-garde' an implicit 
distancing of the artist from 
his environment. UCSD 
Music Department stead-
fasts Ed Harkins and Phillip 
Larson , known also as THE, 

offered entertainment 0 
diverse, unpredictable and 
defiant of description that 
only this independence from 
any identifiable environment 
remained constant through-
out the performance. And 
performance it was. THE 
presented a series of events. 

Their concert la st 
Wednesday opened, amid 

intense anticipation from the 
near capacity audience at the 
Mandeville Auditorium, with 
a lovely rendition of Sergi 
Rachmanino~f's Vocalise. 
The piece was beautifully 
performed, with the very able 
assistance of Jean-C harles 
Francois on piano. Yet there 
existed a certain am biguity of 
interpretation in t his piece 

which was to typify the 
entire evening. It just eemed 
out of place somehow, like 
Model-T 's at Indianapolis -
nice, but why? THE's game, 
it seemed, was expectation 
and how it could be used to 
comic effect. They continued 
with a n imacculately 
choreographed mime/ lip-
synchronization of a duel 

between players of matching 
10" synthesizers. Again they 
used sounds which in a 
familiar context could easily 
stand alone musically, and, 
armed with the self-mockery 
that characterized the entire 
performance, turned them to 
their own peculiar comic 
intent.

Formed seven years ago 
in the Bay Area, the Greg 
Kihn Band has e tablished 
a reputation as being 
among the best of the 
Northern California rock 
and roll band , offering a 
strong, unforced rock and 
rol1 that has a refreshingly 
alive pop-edge to it. Kihn 
him elf is a chari matic 
figure in per on, pos es -
ing a powerful, emotive 
voice that's been the 
frequent highlight of their 
six albums. The latest of 
which, Rockihnroll, is their 
best yet, with two full sides 
of good time party music.

perfectly executed unison 
motions, simulta neousl y

utterly ridiculou ,a beautiful

'Crimes' forces a heavy 
tone of morals and ethics 
If you haven ' t been to 

Confession lately August 
Strindberg's There Are 
Crimes and Crimes which 
just closed at the UCSD 
Theatre could have made 
adequate compensation . It 
was as deadly earnest as a 
Calvinist Sunday chool 
prayer recital and about a 
much fun. 

Strindberg (whose Chris-
tian name defin es his 
character) was a gloomy, 
depressive Swede (as opposed 
to merry, depressive Swedes 
- there are two kind ) whose 
obsession with guilt and 

Crimes and Crimes was more 
anxiety ridden than feared . 

Evil intention. the 
liabilities of evil thought and 
the power of the individual to 
punish him elf with guilt and 
remor ea ' if the thought 
were the act, fill the play. (It 
wa ' question ' like the e that 
remind me why I dropped my 
phi losophy clas e ') A play 
dealing with the e topic 
need not be automatically 
unrelentingly overbearing 
and underwhelming -
Shakespeare and Ibsen both 
dealt with similar subjects 
with power and vitality -

Theater/M ike Thomas 
redemption blankets this 
play with an overwhelming 
moral tone not found since 
the last Jerry Farwell rerun. 

There are plays and there 
are plays, and they eem to 
fall into two categories: the 
mild little divertissments and 
those didactic works of 
theatre that ram their points 
down the viewers' throats 
like ethical elixir. Per onally, 
1 don't like being force fed 
anything without my 
con ent, and although J 
s hould have known what J 
was getting into (I mean have 
you ever known a light-
hearted Sca ndina vi an? 
Those long winter night s do 
something to you, ju t look at 
Bergman movies) There are 

but Strindberg' Swedenbor-
gian m ysticis m is so 
unrelentingly rigid and 
dogmatic that noted director 
Georgij Paro (Regent' s 
Lecturer for Spring quarter 
at the Drama dept. and 
imported all the way from 
Yugo lavia) has his work cut 
out for him with thi tract 
play and doe n't eem to have 
inspired him to any heights of 
imaginative glory. The actor 
eem suit ably uptight (with 

the exeption of the vibrant 
andra ydney) delivering 

each line a if it were Holy 
Writ. 

The 'et de ' ign by Robert 
I Tae! mu t have sou nded like 
a good idea during rehear al 
but having the entire stage 

It's Here!!! 

draped with heet sugges ts 
not so much an 'other' dream-
like experience but a Bekins 
storage closet. It draws 
attention to itself rather than 
serves as a Montparnas e 
Churchyard. a re taurant in 
the Boi de Boulogne or the 
Luxembourg Gardens. 

Like the recent film, 
Breaker Morant, There Are 
Crimes alld Crimes deals with 
some crucial and relevant 
questions. However, great or 
even good art does not define 
itself by merely tackling 
important moral ituation 
but illuminates the human 
condition in uch a way that 
the work of art becomes alive 
and invites participation . 
There A re Crimes and Crimes 
stacks all the cards in its 
favor , becoming not only 
deadly didactic (and dull) but 
totalitarian in the process. 
Good intentions alone do not 
a work of art make, the form 
determines how success ful 
the realization of the concept 
will be , and de spite 
Strindberg's noblealtempt at 
exposing the effect of guilt 
and remor e. hi cardboard 
fantasy never rises out of its 
one-dimen 'ional ermonette 
qualit y. Th cat harti c 
deliverance hoped for never 
materializes. men .

Q: Is douching with vinega r a nd water a good m e thod of 
birth control? 
A: It doesn't much matter what you douche with - ice water, 
hot water, oapy water, green tea, coca cola - because 
douching won't work as a birth control method. By the time you 
get to the bathroom hundreds and hundred of sperm have 
moved into the uterus and are speeding toward that egg. 
Nothing you can do will stop them by that time. Douching 
washes out the vagina and only t he vagina. It doesn't wash out 
the u terus. If there are sperm in the vagina, douching may 
wash them out, but it won't touch the ones in the uterus. 

Q: What is a cervical cap? 
A: The cervical cap is a small, thimble-shaped device made of 
rubber which fits over the cervix', or neck of the uteru , that 
protrudes into the top of back of the vagina. In contrast to the 
diaphragm, which is held in place by the pre ure of its rim 
against the vaginal wall, the cap fits directly around the cervix . 
The Student Health Service's Contraceptive Clinic does not 
carry the cervical cap, but can give an interested student more 
information about thi device.

But as CWO defender ' 
argued, uch a method of 
financing would unneces-
sarily complicateputtingon a 
film eries over a year-long 
period. 

And CWO member Jon 
Bekken aid the move would 
have killed the film erie 
because of the political 
ideology of Tollner and 
certain members of the 
Activity Fee Board, from 
whom CWO would have to 
eek funding. 

"This i clearly a political 
railroad. You have just voted 
to send us to the hands of 
fascists who have always 
wanted to kill our cause," 
said Bekken , after the 
Council originally approved 
the motion. 

Later in the meeting, 
suggestion such as charging 
admission for the films or 
reducing the $12,500 figure 
made by Council member 
were debated. 

"In my mind, there' no 
good rea on they can't charge 
a dollar or two for the e ' 
things, " aid Commiss ioner 
of Communications Tricia 
Russo. 

NOTler:: 
In view of the recent increase 

in personal crimes in the campus 
community, the Associated Students 

is seeking volunteers to act as 
escorts for students, faculty 
and staff during finals Week. 
Escorts will work in 2Y2 hour 

blocks. 
Volunteers are requested to submit 
their names to the A.S. Secretary at 
x4450 before Wednesday, June 3, in 
order to set up an appointment for 

screening and selection. 

tlekken argued tha t 
logi tical arrangement 
would be co tly if admi ion 
wa charged and noted that 
" tudents already pay a $6 
activity fee. Why should they 
pay twice for the films?" 

And when Commi 'sioner 
of Public Relations Toby 
Raymond moved to reduce 
the CWO budget to $10,000, 
Bekken vowed to discontinue 
the eries should the Council 
mak such a deci ion . 

"We cannot run a film 
series on $10,000. We won 't 
touch the money. There will 
not be a film series, and the 
s tudents will know why," he 

aid . 
The motion 10 t , one to 13. 
After midnight, the CWO, 

its budget intact, wa placed 
under a new heading -
services - along with the AS 
Internship Office and the 
SCURI Grant Center , 
effectively evering it 
budgetary ties to Tollner and 
the Activity Fee Board. 

But the close vote on the 
entire budget (8-7) indicates 
that this compromise wa not 
favorably received by many 
Council member .
