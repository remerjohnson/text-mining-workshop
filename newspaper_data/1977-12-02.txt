New wave of 
bogus permits 
plagues police 

by Eric Jaye 
Sian Writer 

" !t's counterfeiting," a mild 
form perhaps, but UCSD police 
detective Murray Penhollow 
says, "it's a crime and we will 
prosecute for it. " 

Detective Penhollow is not, 
as one might expect, talking 
a bout some enterprising 
students printing crisp twenty 
dollar bills. He is concerned 
with the illegal reproduction of 
those $36 parking permits that 
must adorn all student autos 
parked on campus. 

According to Penhollow there 
have been problems in the past 
with students using stolen 
parking permits, but recently 
counterfeiting has added a new 
twist to tbe situation. 

Penbollow says tbat there 
have been tbree cases of 
counterfeited permits reported 
recently and tbat tbese "are 
just the tip of tbe icebe .... " 

Penbollow told of One case ot 
a counterfeited permit. He said 
that on Oct. 3 a student 
purchased an "A" parking 
permit. On Oct. 21 that student 
returned the permit and

Leifer says AS has 
set its groundwork 
President feels government should now 
establish Its legitimacy with students 

by Mark Stadler 
After one quarter of life, the 

ASUCSD government has set 
up its operating guidelines and 
is ready to establish its 
legitimacy in the eyes of 
students, according to AS 
President Jeff Leifer. 

Although the AS has had its 
share of political troubles this 
quarter - the temporary 
resignation of the Vjce-
president and the documented 
charge of fund misuse by a 
commisioner among them -
Leifer believes the government 
has done a good job in laying the 
groundwork for its future 
workings. 

"sim new" 
"We're still new. Give us 

some time, " Leifer said 
Wednesday. 

The AS, or Associated 
Student form of government, 
was reestablisbed at UCSD as 
tbe official student government 
after a five-year absence , 
during which time a series of 
experimental, unofficial 
(meaning not recognized by 
CbanceUor McElroy) govern-
inC bodies made decisions for 

the student body. Last spring, 
in a referendum , students 
approved the AS, and later 
elected Leifer, who had been a 
prime advocate of the return of 
an AS. 

In a wide-ranging interview 
with the Triton Times, the Muir 
College senior touched on: the 
government ' s fall quarter 
achievements and future 
goals; the problems of gaining 
legitimacy with students and 
getting help in making the 
governmental machinery 
work; the alleged misuse of 
student funds by AS external 
affairs commissioner Bob 
Drapeau ; and the presi-
dential impeachment charges 
brought by AS public relations 
director Jon Bekken. 

early November a COUIItIrfett 
decal, apparently a colored 
photocopy of his original 
permit, was found on this 
student's car. Tbe permit was 
removed and the student is 
being charged with petty theft. 

UCSD student develops plan 
to cut Del Mar rental rates 

The AS's fall quarter achiev-
ements have been "intangible, 
and so not really visible to 
students," Leifer said. Tbe 
primary needs of the new 
government were to set up a 
strong institutional structure, 
to establish the governmental 
by-laws and Student Activity 
Fee guidelines, as well al 
making sure students are 
represented on important 
campus committee , task 
forces and search committees, 
he said. 

" When I've talked to people 
from the UCLA and UC 
Berkeley governments, they 've 
told me how surprised they are 
at how far we' ve come in our 
first quarter , in gaining 
legitimacy with the adminis-
tration," he said. 

Commenting on this and 
similar cases Penhollow said, 
. 'I think that these are foolish 
litt le crimes. It's lack of 
knowledge that allows them to 
happen." . 

Penh 011 ow emphasized that 
parking services keeps a list of 
all stolen permits and can 
easily recognize counterfeit 
ones. He repeated several 
times, "We will prosecute for 
this sort of thing."

Some student rental rates in 
Del Mar could be reduced to as 
low as $280 a month for a three 
bedroom apartment in a 
proposal before the City 
Planning' C9mmission. 

Developers wbo contract 
with tbe city to keep apart-
ments at low rental rates will be 
allowed to exceed zoning space 
restriction. by 20 percent. 

Rent is too. high at 
Torrey Pines Village 

Torrey Pines Village, a 
housing development placed at 
the University Towne Centre, i. 
in direct violation of tbe Hahn 
PCD (Planned Community 
Development) permit, accord-
ing to a report prepared by 
architects and engineering 
department of the Campu.1 
Community Programming 
Committee. 

The permit, supported by 
UCSD, state. tbat tbe rental 
apartments must be "compar-
able to tbe University housing 
rates," and that eacb must be 
triplexes or four-plexes. (UCSD 
initiated tbe low COlt hoUling 
provision of the PCD permit in 
1975 in order to accommodate 
the current student hou.ing 
Shortage.) 

The apartments whicb have 
been built at the UTC are one to 
two bedrooms each and are all 
substantially above UCSD 
housin, rates. 

According to a spokesman of 
the DrogiD Company, subcon-
tractor of the housing develo~ 
ment, tbe two bedroom unfu~ 
lsbed apartments range from 
S375 to $395 per month. Use of a 
refrilerator is extra. 

The two bedroom married 
student apartments at UCSD 
currentlY rent from $159 to $225 
per month with utilities 
included. Speculation has been 
made that because of the high 
rental price, students would not 
be able to afford the housing. 

Tbe report asserted that 
earlier this year, the Planning 
Department staff wrote to the 
company asking that it justify 
its rent. in ligbt of the PCD 
permit . According to the 
Planning Department staff, the 
company responded that 
considerin, inflationary 
construction and operating 
costs, it considers these rents 
consistent with the PCD 
permit. 

The Rental Housing Bonus 
Plan was developed by Loren 
Kaye, a Del Mar City Planning 
Comissioner and a UCSD 
student. " It is morally wrong 
for a city to close itself off to 
particular income levels, " he 
said yesterday in a council 
chamber press conference. 
"Del Mar is fast becoming an 
enclave for the upper-middle 
cla.s .. . access is being for-
closed to all but the well-to-do. 
The zoning ordinances are 
exclusionary and may be 
subject to court action." 

A skyroeke& 
In tbe last few years property 

values and rental levels have 
skyrockted in Del Mar pricing 
the market far beyond the low 
income range of graduate 
students and young families 
who want to establish homes in 
tbe community. Kaye noted 
that in some cases tax asses-
sments have increased by 45 
percent, squeezing elderly 
residents out of their homes. 

A special census taken in 1975 
indicated that the median value 
for Single family homes had 
climbed to $74,749 and condo-
miniums were above $50,000. 
Area real estate companies 
estimate anywhere from a 20 to 
40 percent increase in price 
since the survey was con-
ducted. 

Kaye's report finds that " Del 
Mar ranks far below all other 
jurisdictions in the county in 
both numbers and percent of 
low income families." More 
than a quarter of all the renting 
households in Del Mar pay 25 
percent or more of their income 
as rent 

Structures built under the 
Rental Housing Bonus plan 
would be under a permanent 
lien that sets the rental rates at 
fair market levels established 
for tbe county by the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban 
Development. Interviews 
would be conducted by the 
County Housing Authority to 
insure that tenants meet 
moderate or low income 
guidelines. The city would 
make available bonus housing 
information and would sign the 
agreement which binds the 
landlord to tbe provisions of the 
program. 

No police enforcemeo& 
Unlike rent control attemp-

ted elsewhere in the state and 
nation, Kaye stressed that this 
plan does not use the police 
power of the state to enforce 
legal restrictions on what may 
be charged in rental. The 
builder freely enters into the 
agreement in order to secure 
the bonus of increasing the 
space constructed. 

Even though the proposal 
increases the size of structures 
on a section of land, Kaye 
believes that, " the added bulk 
impact will be more than 
compensated by the positive 
social impacts which are the 
aim of the proposal...there will 
be no added density population, 
intensity of u e, traffic or city 
services. " 

Once reviewed by the 
planning board, the proposal 
will be re-lered to the City 
Council which Kaye believe 
will plac the item on the March 
ballot. 

ResulLs 
That administrative legiti-

macy has resulted in student 
participation on many import-
ant campus committees, Leifer 
said. But he acknowledged that 
it hasn ' t gained the AS 
legitimacy with the students. 
He said students still don ' t 
know enough about the govern-
ment, and gave partial blame 
for that to the campus media 
which, he feels, has concen-
trated more on " sensational-
istic" personal conflicts and 
less on the AS's day-to-day 
operations. 

How can the fledgling 
government gain student 
support? 

"We have to learn what the 
students want ... through 
surveys, task forces and AS 
representatives soliciting 
input .. . and show them that the 
AS can help them get those 
things. When we do that, they'll 
respond," Leifer said . 

Also, he said, the myriad 
student organizations must 
allow the AS some decision-
making authority. " All the 
campus groups want every-
thing, there are no lowered 
expectations here," said the 
political science student. " The 
first time the AS doesn' t give 
the pe~son all he wants, he runs 
to the Triton Times (by writing 
a lettel" to the editor) ."

public before the Council 
meeting. She also cited theJ1ct 
that the assesment figures 
contained in the agreement 
were not definite and that the 
City had not adequately 
researched funding sources for 
purchasing the land for a 
regional park. 

The agreement would allow 
development within the 
Penasquitos Canyon which is 
currently designated as a 3,730 
acre regional park in the 1973 
Open Space Element of the City 
General Plan. 

Jack Kausman, an attorney 
representing 200 citizens from 
the Rancho de los Penasquitos 
area , also suggested a contin-
uance, stating that allowing 
development within the Open 
Space Element may violate 
state and federal codes. 

Although the Penasquitos 
canyon figures prominently in 
Mayor Wilson's 1972 mayorial 
campaign, he was absent from 
the meeting. 

and that arguments over 
misleading questions become 
unimportant. As an indicator of 
what is important to this 
campus and to the rest of this 
country, the issue of research 

and development must be 
looked upon not as a feud over 
what is " right" and " wrong," 
but rather as a system that asks 
why and how these questions 
could be important and what 
these questions overlook.

guiding force for Wolf & Hiumiller concerts, Steve Wolf died traqically at his home last week. He was 
responsible for bringing SaD Diego many of its top concerts,. including Fleetwood Mac, ELP and 
Aerosmitb just to name a few. What really hurts is that Steve Wolf was such a decent human being, a man I 
considered to be my friend. Since Steve made it possible for us to cover many of the shows we review, 
we decided to dedicate our Arts page to his memory. We will miss him. - Tim Mackenzie. 

In Concert: Aerosmith __ Piper, Money, Trower, Babys 
by Tim Mackenzie 

& 
Peter Robbins 

There have been so many 
concerts in San Diego during 
the past two weeks that we 've 
barely had time to catch our 
breath between shows. Here's a 
recap of some of them. 

Aerosmith & Wet Willie -
This could have been entitled 
the " Once Is Not Enough" 
show, one of the quickest rock 
concerts I've seen. After a fine 
openi ng set by Southern 
rockers Wet Willie, climaxed 
by their anthem " Keep on 
Smiling" Aerosmith came on 
as the curtain went uJ), and just 
an hour's music later they were 
gone. 

What Aerosmith did show, 
however , was pretty impres-
sive. They opened with an 
app ropriate "Back in the 
Sadd le" of the Rocks LP and 
didn't stop boogieing. Their set 
ran through much of their 
materia l from past to present, 
InCluding " Big Ten Inch," 
"Wa lk This Way , " "Sweet 
Emotion" and. the new single 
"Draw the Line." They finisbed 
their show with a rousing 
"Train Kept A Rollin '," and 
decli ned to do the usually 
obligatory "Dream On." 

As a stage band, Aerosmith is 
totally dominated by prancing, 
strutti ng, pouting singer Steven 
Tyler and Keith Richard 
lookalike Joe Perry. They are 
(excuse the comparison) the 
Jagger & Richard of American 
rock 'n' roll, an exclune link 
between the punk rockers and 
the great rockers of the sixties. 
Their music is really raunchy 
and loud, but It sounds lood that 

~ay . Now If they'd only play 
Just a few fR9re minutes ... 

Robin Trower & Eddie Money 
- "You can't keep a good man 
down" they say. As if to prove 
that statement, Robin Trower 
returned to San Diego with a 
slightly altered band and a slew 
of his R&B rock music. 

Trower is undeniably one of 
the finest guitarists of nis kind 
in the world, but his act seemed 
to be getting a little stale. Well, 
he's rectified that with some 
switches in his band, shifting 
old cohort James Dewar to 
center stage for his bluesy 
vocals while employing a new 
bassist in Rustee Allen. His 
show provided a good mix of 
Trower standards ("Day of the 
Eagle," "Fool and Me") and 
new material off of his new LP 
In City Dreams. ' 

But the most interesting 
aspect of the evening was 
opening act Eddie Money. With 
a new album out and single on 
the charts ("Two Tickets to 
Paradise") Money appears to 
be flying high. But he's far from 
being a typical young rocker 
trying to break into the show biz 
world. 

Money is a 3~- year - old 
veteran performer from San 
Francisco, a man who enjoys 
kick-ass rock 'n' roll, as anyone 
who has heard his music can 
attest to. "I love perfonningon 
stage," says Money. 'It gives 
me a chance to get away from 
the hotel room." 

Money started out by actual-
ly singing old AI Jolson 
numbers, but soon progressed 
to rock and roll of the Chuck 
Berry variety. He was in a band 
caned Rockets out on the east 
coast before his eventual tum 
to today's Eddie Money band. If 
his record sales and concert 
reactions are any Indic~tion of 

hi s potential, Money is a n 
excellent investment for his 
label. As the BeatIes used to 
say, "Money, that 's what I 
want! .. 

The Babys & Piper - This 
concert had to be the most 
pleasant surprise show of the 
year. A promotional concert 
put on by California Concerts 
and KPRI FM, tickets were 
only $1.06, though most people 
probably got in free . 

The concert opened with 
Piper, a dynamic hard-rocking 
band paced by prancing singer-
guitarist Billy Squier. The 
band, only playing together for 
tbe past year and a half, was 
nevertheless exceptionally 
tight, making one believe that 
they'd been playing together 
for ten years . 

The band's leader Squier took 
two full years putting Piper 
together, writing the material 
for the rirst album and finding 
the right business team to guide 

career 

exposure. Squier appears to be 
an intelligent performer who 
knows exactly what he wants 
from the business , and as such 
he signed with Aucoin Manage· 
ment, who also manage Kiss, 
Starz and The Babys. " There's 
no visual resemblance between 
us and Starz or Kiss ," Squier 
was quick to point out. Indeed, 
it would be a mistake to put 
them into that category. First 
of all , their approach is 
strajghter. Second of all, 

they're better than their Starz 
and Kiss . 

Musically, Squier decided on 
a three-guitar lineup for a full , 
hard-edged rock sound. Squier 
himself plays guitar and sings 
lead vocal as well as writing 
all the material. Also on guitars 
are Tommy Gunn and Alan 
Nolan. Danny McGary plays 
bass and Richie Fontana is on 
drums . Pipers latest LP is 
Can't Wait.

As a Rod Stewart album it 
fares just fine , with enough 
rock e rs a nd some gentle 
ballads to keep his faithful 
happy . Of these, the best rocker 
is " Born Loose" while the 
smooth sing-along " You' re In 
My Heart" (which Rod lip-
synced on the Rock Awards) 
takes the top prize for the 
ballads. 

But listening to Foot Loose &

spectrum of music than just

you the feeling that this one is

Eddie Money has be en

for his fine " debut" albums. 
Perhaps MODey could become

Novelist to visit UCSD 
Novelist and critic William 

Gass will present a reading of 
his work at 4 pm today in the 
North Conference Room of the 
I 
Student Center at UCSD. Gas~ 
is the author of three major 
novels, "Omensetter's Luck," 
" In the Heart of the Heart of the 
Country" and " Willie Masters' 
Lonesome Wife," as well as a 
host of uncollected short fiction 
and critical articles. 

Gass' background as a writer 
coincides with his profession as 
a student and teacher of 
philosophy. He studied with 
Max Black at Cornell Univer-
sity in the philosophy of 
language and the theory of 
metaphor. During this period, 
he was able to attend seminars 
taught by Ludwig Wittgenstein, 
a fact which Gass feels was a 
major intellectual innuence on 
I,n concert ... 
(Continued from page 5) 

Following Piper on the bill 
were The Babys, one of the 
most promising and exciting 
young bands I've seen in 
several years . I originally 
conceived of them as being 
some type of Bay City Rollers, 
replete with the glossy high-
pressure hype. 

But these guys don't play like 
~abies . In fact, their music is 

his writing . Another strong 
infuence came from reading 

, Gertrude Stein while in 
graduate school, and many of 

his recent articles and reviews 
have dealt with Stein 's 
importance in terms oJ her 
reading of American geo-
graphy and history . Thi s 
interest can be seen in his 
excellent introduction to Stein's 
" Geographical History of 
America ." 

After graduate school, Gass 
taught at Purdue University, 
Washington University and 
other universities, speciali,zing 
in the theory of metaphor and 
analytical philosophy. His most 
recent book, " On Being Blue," 
is part history of philosophy, 
part metaphysical musing and 
part original speculation. 

sophistica ted and well -
executed, blending the melodic 
sounds of keyboards (courtesy 
of Mike Corby) with a punctuat-
ing rock guitar from Walt 
Stocker. 

The Babys are a good-looking 
band with excellent music, a 
sense of style , and good 
management. Frankly, I'll be 
surprised if they don't become 
stars. So will all the young girls 
clammoring in front of the 
stage.

by a leDeratioD of idiot savants.

a,ainst the encroacbing 
sopbistication in instrumental 
,kiD and recordinI tecbnololY" 

Rather than be sucked into 
the morau of ma .. marketiq 
'they play up the rauncb, the 
volume, and the vul,arity of 
their stance, infusing their 
music with the rough bewn 
vitality that marked the Stones 
and the Who. 

Unfortunately, anyone with 
more than ten years of rock and 
roD listening experience sbould 
discern that the songs being 
offered these days don't come 
up to the standards the Stones 
or the Who unwittingly laid 
down. And for a movement 
pretentious en(Jugh to take its 
monicker from a defunct period 
in French cinema, there are no 
Godards, Traffauts, Rivettes, 
or Chabrols to be found. There 

Tbe point of modem punki-
tude (at first glance an anti-
intellectual movement) seems 
to be that all the members must 
adhere to a premise espoused 
by MarshaD McLuhan: It's not 
what you say, but bow you say 
it. 

Tbat aphorism served as a 
credo for the New York avant-
gard community, who've spent. 
the last fifteen years tryiJlI to! 
restructure the banal artifacta 
of modem Ufe into a Dew mystic 
langua,e that forces the viewer 
to reco,ni!e tbe si,ns and 
symbols that ultimately rule 
their existence. 

Andy Warhols fabled soup 
can sculpture was DOthing else 
if an ingenious visual .essay in 
semiology. These days, tJJe 
remains of the Big Apple avant 
garde have channeled their 
energies to rock and roll bands 
like the Patti Smith Group, The 
Ramones , Talkin, Heads, 
Television,' Richard Hell and 
the Voidoids, and others. None 
of these guys are the dunced out 
children of technology they'd 
have us believe, but rather 
gravitate towards rock and roll 
from mostly literary origins. 

Patti Smith, for example, is a 
published poet and playwrite, 
as well as a former rock critic, 

isn't even a David 
~~~~:::';;:":='::I 

Kaye (the one le,itimate link to 
the Frencb New Wave: Godard 
and Traffaut were film critics 
who decided to put their 
theories into practice) . Tom 
VerlaiDe of Television took his 
name from a dead Frencb poet 
of the Symbolist scbool, and 
frequenUy invokes the names 
of Rimbaud. 

Many of tbe others are 
runaways or colle,e drops out 
with sporadic art and poetry 
backgrounds. Tbese people 
don't sound like the lumpenpro-
lateriate brandishing guitars 
exudin, a class conscious 
snottiness, but rather another 
of the endless modern art-
theatre taqents that ,enerate-
in cramped quarters where one 
must know the theory before 
"seeing" the art on display. 

The New York punk theory is 
,ood in principal, and rhetoric, 
like all aesthetic theories do, 
which is doubtlessly the reason 
an inordinate amount of other 
wise intelligent people are 
attracted to the music. Simply 
put, the bands see no separation 
in the aesthetic response one 
can have between high and low 
art. One, {or example, should 
feel the same excitement over 
Ezra Pound and Allan Ginsberg 
as they do over Dylan and 
Chuck Berry. 

not terribly inviting even on the 
most morbid scale. Rock music 
works best, even when ' it is 
contrary to academic analysis 
and elevated technique ala Ves 
or Zappa - when it gets onto 
the busineu of being fun. 

There is a sense that Bob 
Segers' most recent workNip&, 
Movies is an intelligently 
crafted piece of poetic refiec-
tion set to music. Seger 
recognizes that he has to funnel 
his talents throu,h the music, 
lettilll the beat and rhythms 
exist as properties in them-
selves, not bone-dry structures 
with wbich to dangle an odd 
assortment of posing, poetry, 
and myth mongering. 

Even Bruce Springsteen fails 
in this respect, having violated 
the sanctity of the son,. His . 
words extend farther than what 
he bas to say, with his music, 
elongated to bolster the 
verbage, defused in the 
process. Patti Smith and ber 
peers fail grossly, refusin, to 
acknowledge the ecological 
limits of their craft. None of 
them knows how to write a good 
song.

Likewise, there should be no 
difference in what one per· 
ceives over from John Cage or 
Black Oak. The distinctions 
between high and low culture 
are mental traps that imprison 
peoples' responses ' to art, 
forcing them to be more 
analytical than emotional 
inclined, detached rather than 
engaged . Patti Smith more 
than anyone else in the 
movement puts all the pieces 
together, using the rabble 
rousing potential of rock and 
roll to get the audience going, 
then using the consciousness· 
raising power of poetry to lift 
her audience into drunken 
rapture . Smith, though, is an 
extreme example, with the 
other bands following their own 
instincts, but most of them try 
the same thing. But as always, 
the theory comes before the 
music, and the intended effect 
is delayed until the polemics 
register. 

H punk rock is to mean 
anything years from now, the 
bands must abandon their 
conceits of being the vanguard 
of something new and conform 
to the simple rules of good 
music. Even the original punk 
bands of the late sixties, upon 
whom the term was first foisted 
put their ideals where their 
music was, and made their 
songs adhere to elements like 
good riffs, great arrangements, 
lyrics that offered only their 
own worth , and economy . 
Bands like Love, The Seeds, 
The Music Machine , The 
Standells, The MC-5 , The 
Velvet Underground, or The 
Count Five may be gone, but 
songs like .. Psychotic Re-
action" and " Talk Talk" retain 
their power today.

Despite the New Waves '

dead seriousness (which is 
stifling rocks ' vitality) 
appreciating the punk rockers 
is, in itseU, intellectual 
homework. To make matters 

Bluntly, the latter day punks 
haven't written a song as good 
as these, and as such, their's is 
a music onl:; the most walled off 
dilettante could love. In other 
words, it speaks to no one 
except a select few who ' ve 
mastered an incestuous in· 
group vocabulary that reeks of 
a vile and elitism reviled only 
by their high brow brothers like 
Yes, Jethro Tull, and Kansas. 
Perhaps there's no separation 
after all. Certainly their 
intentions are beginning 
to sound increasingly similar 
the more one thinks about it.

Science fiction' films

The current wave of science fiction movies tha t has c rested 
with George Lucas' Star Wars and Steven Speilberg's Close 
Encounters of 'he Third Kind has also tossed a I'!um~r of other 
science fiction stories on the shores of the motIon pIcture and

These films - which have recently been or WIll soon be 
released - range in size of budget and/ or amount of talent from 
the $35-million Superman to the $500,000 Tbe End of th~ World . 

Certainly Superman, which stars 24-year old Ch~lstopher 
Reeves as The Man of Steel and Marlon Brando.as hIS f~the~, 
has received the most media attention. The fIlm, ~hlch IS 
scheduled for release in two separate parts, has been m works 
for several years. Part one is set for ~eleas~ I~te nex~ year. 

Three of the most eagerly awaited sCIence fictIon proJec~ are 
Capricorn ODe, the sequel to S&ar Wan and a new versIon of 
Flash Gordon. Capricorn tells the story of a fake Mars ~p.ace 
flight staged by the American government for political 
purposes. . h ' I 

The S&ar Wan sequel, starring the same c~st and tee nlca 
crew as in the original, will begin pre-productIon work lat«: next 
year. But it will face competition for the space opera audIence 
from Dino de Laurentis' Flu" Gordon. De Laurentls plans to 
spend $20-$25 million on F ..... Gordon, which he says "will 
make S&er Wan pale by comparison." 

Television Is also involved in the headlong science fiction 
rush. Current entries like Lope'. RUB and Man from A&lanlis 
will probably be Joined by several new entries duriDi the 
midseason cbaqeover. Harlan EDison's A Boy ~ Hil~: 

. with a pilot written by Ellison and based on "Blood s a Rover,. 
and allCk Rotert are the most likely candidates in thiS 
cateogry. f 

The lon, awaIted S&ar Trek revival, as the mainstay 0 
Paramount Pictures' fourth TV network, is now planned to 
begin next Fall. Most of the regular cast, with the exception of 
Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock) and DeForrest Kelley (~r. 
McCoy) are expected to return to the bridge of the Enterpnse.

Pre-opening hooplah makes 
'Encounters' a phenomenon 
" Close Encounters of the 

Tbird Kind" has become the 
movie phenomenon of the year. 
And not necessarily because of 
the film itself. At this point it is 
rather more from all that which 
has surrounded its production 
and presentation. 

The secrecy which shrouded 
all of the film's production has 
been well touted . Director 
Steven Spielberg felt that the 
potent impact of the film had to 
be guarded, and so very Ii~tle 
information forthcame dunng • 
these stages. This, of course, 
made those who were cunous 
about the movie all the more 
curious and anxious . 

At one point, the film was 
scheduled for an Easter '77 
release, but delays caused it to 
be moved up to Christmas time. 
So instead, in April, full and 
double page ads wers run in 
newspapers nationwi~e , 
proclaiming the .film's .ar~lval 
in December. ThIS, agam, IS a n 
interesting note of the film, 
although most people must 
have felt an advertisement 
eight months in advanc~ was 
indeed extravagent , If not 
wasteful. Such was the film 's 
early build up. 

Then in the summer, George 
Lucas brought special effects 
into the limelight, and reaf-
finned ' a strong audience for 
such cinema. "Star Wars" can 
also be credited for whetting 
the public's desire . 

Into this market enters 
"Close Encounters." Its $18 
million budget promised no 
small cheap exploitation. Spiel~rg himself has a fine 
reputation as a craftsman. In 
"Jaws" he handled the 
impressive logistics of the 
project witb c~nsi.dera.ble 
expertise. And hiS first (11m, 
"Duel," was a ,reat, Hitch-
cockesque, suspense picture. 

Douglas Trumball , wbo 
bandied the special effects for 
"2001" is the ereator of the 
visuals for " Close Encount-
ers." The publicized technol-
ogy employed was impressiv~ . 
An old dirigible hangar 10 
Alabama converted to a 
complete sound stage, ix times 

larger than anything in 
Hollywood, an extension of the 
computerized camera system 
Lucas used , and the new 
processes an~ technique.s 
TrumbaU and his crew experi-
mented with. 

The press has been unyield-
ing positive, though rarely very 
en lighting. Frank Rich 's scoop 
for Time in late October was 
very enthusiastic, had ~ice· 
color pictures, but added little 
to any knowledge of the film. 
Followed were so m<lny 
featu'res in a variety of 
magazines and newspapers. 
More and more inside stories 

,1944-' 

and in-depth interviews, mostly 
entitled .. A Close Encounter 
with Steve Spielberg" were 
printed . 

The film will open nationwide 
Dec. 14 (in San Diego at the 
Cinema 21) and until that time, 
it is being shown in only one 
theater in each New York and 
Los Angeles. Having seen the 
film is a major mark of status 
for those wbo count such things, 
the lines for the day's showings 
begin forming before 6: 00 am 
outside LA's Cinerama Dome 
and stretch, quite literally, for 
four blocks.

Scope of "Hobbit" limited 

Speculation about the merits of 
adopting J.R.R . Tolkien's fiction 
to the television or movie screen 
has been around for some time 
now. Commercially, at least, 
such a production would make a 
lot of sense since "The Lord of 
the Rings" and " The Hobbit" 
have been steadily climbing in 
sales since 1958. By now, it seems 
that at least one major film of 
" The Hobbit" or " Lord of the 
Rings " should have been 
produced. 

The only current production, 
however, is crawling along in the 
form of Ralph Bakshi studios, a 
comparitavely small studio, 
where plans for the epic fantasy 
" Lord of the Rings" began in 
1972 . However, Rankin-Bass 
productions , bankrolled by 
Xerox, has rushed past, and beat 
Bakshi to the punch (and 
subsequently the cash-box) and 
produced a made-for-television 
animated special called " The 
Hobbit" (aired Sunday, Novem-

ber 27) . The result of the Rankin-
Bass studio represents the worst 
fears of those who expected, and 
got, a blatant commercialization 
of Tolkien's work. 

One of the main reasons why 
the television presentation of 
." The Hobbit" was so hollow is 
because it suffered too much 
from a sense of compromise on 
the part of Rankin-Bass and 
Xerox. (One spokesman from 
the company said that they 
rejected almost 30 scripts to find 
" the right one.") 

The script that they did find , 
however , tried too hard to 
incorporate too much in 90 
minutes . The result was a 
skeletal ouUine of an extensive 
plot which was compressed at a 

. very hurried pace. It was too 
literal and the corresponding 
effect was spotty. "The Hobllit" 
became a confusing set of 
incidents strung together 
without the build -up or the 
charm of the original book. 

The resulting loss of char-
acterization is large (ask any 
person who has not read Tolltien 
before iC they remember the 
name oC GandalO . 

The script limitations were 
emphasized by the animation , 
entirely done the Japan, which 
Ceatured characters who were 
physically misrepresen ted. 
Gollum (in the book a dark 
creature lank with starvation) 
was pictured entirely too fa t , the 
trolls were physically too la rge 
and the D ragon, Sm aug, looked 
m9re like a Cheshire cat than 
anything else. Also, the voice 
characterizations were very 
trying. T he elves sounded more 
like pseudo-Nazis than anything 
else. 

Though technically slick, the 
animation in the film was too 
stilted . R a nk in- B ass a nd 
Compa n y used a Corm oC 
a nima t ion ca ll e d limited 
animation - that is, they used 
details a nd technical slickness to 
hide the limited cha r acterization 
of movement whi c h were 
expressed by the figures . (The 
best example of this is, of course, 
the Saturday morning cartoon. 
Here, the animation is limited 
only to an occasional limb 
movement and lip synchroni-
zation.. And, like the Staurday 
morning cartoons, the limited 
animation in " The Hobbit " 
emphasized stilted and not fluid 
movement amongst the charac-
ters . 

As a comparison , Ralph 
Bakshi is producing his " Lord of 
the Rings" in full animation. And 
ailhough Bashki ' s techniques 
are sloppy, his animation tends 
to. stress believability. 

Bakshi tends to work around 
his limitations, even though his 
results are not always successful 
("Coonskin," "Heavy Traffic") . 
Already he bas finished a warm-
up to the " Lord of the Rings" 
(the moderately successful 
" Wizards" ) . It will be interest-
ing to see how he will approach 
" Lord of the Rings. "

were Lho~t' with Star War on 
the Ir covers . till s a nd 
posters from the mOVIe, as 
well as Imitation lightsabers , 
a lso went fast. 

It's only appropriate that 
Slar Wars should prove so 
popular at a convention 
where the fa ns who origmally 
made the movie such a hit 
congregate . But how did 
science fiction fans help 
make tar Wa rs such a hugh 
success? 

Las t summer , a year 
be fore Star Wa r s was

Charles Lippincott went to 
'cience fictio n and comic

While most fan' were more 
than a little skeptical , they

best. Come May 26 , opening 
night, the movie houses were 
packed for the early evening 
shows. 

The Star· Wars scramble 
hasn 't stopped since. 

It was only natural then 
that the most popular panels 
at the Con were those 
concerning Slar Wa rs . Last

effects \\olza rds expl~tn some 
of the fil m 's secrets . 

The most amazmg thing 
a bout the di sC'us'iion wa), 
that , even though t.he techni-
cians spoke m pr ctically 
incomprehensIble te rms , 
most of the audience 'ieemed 
to understand tbem. When an 
animator spoke of roto-
sco pes , optical overs and 
industrial light, a fan would 
ask a questIOn using equally 
technical phrases. 

Of course, the end result of 
a ll the technical work wa the 
special effects, and that's 
why all five technicians 
received a large round of 
applause at the panel's end . 

And , in the e nd . it was the 
special effects that made 
Sta r Wa rs the hit it is today . 
The storyline , in its mythic 

implicity ha s' t r uck a 
responsive chord. But If it 
hart to sta nd alone, without 
.he effects, Star Wars would 
haw flopped . The characters 
aren t strong enough. With 
the exceptions of Han 010, 
Obi-Wan Kenobi and See-
Threepio , they ' re pretty 
weak, in fact. 

But, the Star Wars story, 
combined with the incredible 
. pecial effects - the ,<plos-
ions and laser animation , the 
j ump to hyperspace and the 
aliens in the cantina - make 
the movie a smash. 

The word fan' stems from 
fanatic , and one of the most 
triking things about any 

convention are the fanati c 
qualities of the fans . At first 
glance, it does seem ab urd 
for a person to devote so 
much attention to something 
like Star Wars or Star Trek or 
comic books . And it does 
seem ridiculous to hear a 
comic book writer or a movie 
animator ponitificate on the 
intricacies and politics of 
their craft. 

But j[ comic boo ks or 
m ovies a r e viewed as 
entertainment, good enter-
tainment, then devotion to 
them is no m ore crazy than 
d ev oti on to foot b a l l or 
politics. 

Of course, someone who 
has seen Star Wars 92 times, 
or who knows the vill ain 
featured in Sp ider-m a n 
number 28 , doe s h ave 
problems. But, then, so does 
someone who knows the score 
of the 1947 Lehigh-Colgate 
football game. 

And a Sc ience F ic tion , 
Horror and F antasy Conven-

Antins invent and discover 
through post -conceptual art 

by Debbie Schwartz 
Narrative form has become a 

fundamental element in the art 
of the seventies. As the formal 
and conceptual genres of the 
sixties become more life-
oriented, social, political , 
economic, and autobiograph-
ical themes have ripened into 
important communicable ideas 
for the arts. 

David and Eleanor Antin, two 
Visual Arts professors here at 
UCSD, have been working in 
this post-conceptual genre for 
the past few years. Although 
each of the Antins has a dis-
tinct, individual means of self-
expression , they also have 
some similar concerns. Both 
deal with an overlapping of 
medias and genres; Eleanor 
using photography, painting 
and performance to blend 
theatre and art and David using 
verbal and written language as 
well as performance to 
combine linguistics, poetry, 
and art. 

• !!-. •• •• •• • - •• .! 

Another common feature in 
the work of the Antina is a sense 
of invention and discovery. 
Eleanor described this feature 
of her work in a recent 
interview. "The human soul is 
not passive. It keeps moving. 
Through my work I continually 
invent and discover myself at 
the same time ." David 
explained this sense of 
discovery from a different 
angle by emphasizing his 
interest in the " nature of self" 
in relation to " how we discover 
the way weare," " how much of 
the invention of self is 
fictional ," and "how the mind 
discovers a nd invents ," 
particularly with respect to 
" how language affects mean-
ing. " 

Eleanor and David also 
present analogous views about 
history in their work . Mythol-
ogy plays a major role in the 
recording of their work as well 
as in their conceptions of 
history in general. David 
explores the invention of 
history , but remains somewhat 
ambivalent as to what degree 
history is fiction . In his book, 
talking at the boundaries, he 
muses over social agreements 
that lead to the idea of truth in 
history in a recorded lecture 
called " the invention of fact. " 
Eleanor is more sure of her 
view of history and in a written 
piece of criticism ("Reading 
Rushca," Art in America goes 
so far as to say, "Once an event 
is over it has become history 
and history is always fiction ." 

But aside from these few 
similar convictions and the 
facts that both of the Antins 
were born in New York City in 
the 30s, attended City College 
there, and are now married, 
David and Eleanor are each

hiihly individualistic, espec-
ially in their artwork. 

Eleanor majored in writini 
at colleie and minored in art. 
She wrote poetry for several 
years, worked as a professional 
actress, and also tried painting 
before explorin&. mixed-media 
and performance. Shortly after 
moving to California , she 
beca me II intrigued by the 
semantic and syntactical 
elements" of a Sears catalogue. 
Soon, a series of " Consumer 
Goods Portraits " evolved, 
where goods ordered from the 
catalogue were collaged 
together to create real and 
fictitious personalit ies . 
Eleanor tired {If travelling back 
and forth between New York 
and California for exhibitions 
and gallery showings. 

As a solution to the problem, 
she created "100 Boots. " " 100 
Boots" used the U.S. mail as a 
distribution system. Over a 
period of 21h years, she mailed 
51 different post-cards to 1000 
people describing photograph-
ically and verbally the 
escapades of the 100 Boots as 
they made their way across the 
country, finally "crashing" at 
the Museum of Modern Art. 

Eleanor'S current work is 
involved with biographicall 
autobiographical transfor-
mations. This growing interest 
began in the physical realm 
with a piece entitled " The 
Carving Piece," which con-
sisted of a series of nude phote>-
graphs taken daily over a 

. period of 36 days which depict 
her weight-loss of 10 pounds. 
Her more recent work is more 
concerned with psychological 
transformations. She explains 
in a statement about her 
" Angel of Mercy" exhibit, "I 

have found it useful to imaiine 
my soul as presided over by 
four dignities - a Ballerina, a 
King, a Nurse, and a Black 
Movie Star. By dividing myself 
amona these four great 
personas I bave learned a lot 
about my life and character 
and my situation in the world." 

"Angel of Mercy" was an 
historical melodrama which 
reenacted the life of Florence 
Nightingale during the Crim-
ean War. Through the use of 
photographs, cut-out movable 
figures , and performance, an 
understanding of that time and 
space was easily attainable for 
Antin as well as for her 
audience. Critic Kim Levin 
describes the work of Eleanor 
Antin in Arts Magazine, March 
1977, "Past and present, life 
and art, continually overlap, 
drawing strength from dis-
crepancies between history and 
fiction, figure and background, 
and Pirandellian confusions 
between reality and role, object 
and subject, image and selr." 

David Antin, on the other 
hand, has a background in 
Science and Languages. His 
initial entry into the field of art 
was through poetry, althQugh 
he is also a critic and phil-
osopher . He explained his 
frustration with orthodox 
forms of poetry and criticism 
as an "unreadiness to be clos-ed 
into a box - I don ' t like 
packages - especially other 
peoples' packages, which pre-
exist. " 

The novel is one such closed 
fonn that Antin attempted to 
utilize. He found that he could 
not write a novel because of the 
" dislocatedness of that way of 
thinking.. .. a time ordering that 
-involves connecting parts .. .1

ness of talk and communica-
tions becomes obvious in 
David's works. He refers to his 
works as "art talking pieces" 
and explains that "I go out to 
talk because I prefer to think in 
public." Preparation for' these 
talks varies, depending on the 
topic ' and the audience . He 
defines a good performance as 
.. a negotiation of common 
ground (between himself and 
the audience) that is not trivial 
and is interesting." All of his 
pieces come to life in improv-
isation. 

In a recent discourse at 
UCSD, David talked about his 
life and work. In the style and

comedi an, he discu ssed in 
amusing anecdotes the story of 
ho w he became an artist 
("becoming an artist" refer-
ring to reaching a point where 
you "have a confident sense of 
what you've got to do - even 
though you may not necessarily 
know how to do it "). He 
progressed from the tale of 
getting thrown out of a 
literature class for writing a 
poem and sharing it with a 
classmate, to a description of 
his job as a wrapping machine 
designer i n a bubble-gum 
factory , to his involvement in 
art criticism of art criticism as 
a "straight-forward , dead-pan 
activity ." 

But immediate content is not 
always the most intriguing part 
of David Antin's pieces - his 
underlying structural mean-
ings and insightful outlook 
make his presentationa even 
more valuable, as can be found 
by attending one of his dis-
courses or reading some of his 
transcriptiona. His books can 
usually be found amomg other 
works of poetry, althouih Antin 
is hesistant to cateiorize his 
work as such. 

Eleanor Antin is the extreme 
of a theatrical performance -
assuming the role of director, 
writer, producer, actors, etc. 
David is more of the story-
teller, "My thing is more of a 
verbal theatre - not much 
visual theatricality. It moves 
along a linguistic level. " 
Performance as a narrative 
means of invention , self-
discovery , and artistic en-
deavor is a vital concern of both 
of the Antins as well as of most 
post-coneeptual artists work-
ing today.

Friday, December 2. 1177 triton times 
Just as the city of Liverpool 

had been an area of extraordi-
nary musical vitality and of 
crucial importance in the 
development of popular music 
at the beginning of the sixties, 
the Canterbury area of Kent, 
England, became a true 
breeding ground of progressive 
pop music during the latter half 
of the decade . From here 
emerged such groups as 
The Soft Machine, Matching 
Mole, Hatfield and the North, 
Henry Cow, Egg, Kevin Ayers 
and the Whole World , and 
Caravan. 

Music: Mark Lockett 

Hillage' 5 latest is impressive 

.J 

Steve Hillage's early musical 
career relates directly to the 
development of this movement 
(known as " Canterbury 
rock") . At high school he met 
Dave Stewart and fonned an 
early prototype of the group, 
Egg, and later while at the 
University of Canterbury 
joined Khan, a seven-piece rock 
band made up of ex-members 
of the Crazy World of Arthur 
Brown, before replacing Mike 
Oldfield in the new Kevin Ayers 
group, Decadence, in 1972. 

Although most of the above 
mentioned groups display a 
great deal of individuality , 
there are certain stylistic 
elements common to the 
movement as a whole. Canter-
bury rock, on one level, is a

timbres which ha ve their 
origins in this movement, one 
being the electric organ with 
vibrato and fuzz first used 
extensively by Mike Ratledge 
of the Soft Mac hine as an 
attempt to come to terms with 
the melodic complexity of John 
Coltrane's solos, and the use of 
the sustaining pedal with the 
guitar is quite dis tincti ve also. 
In sharp contrast to the music's 
complexity there is often a 
naivety and sentimentalism in 
the lyric::., and the combination 
of psychic concepts , love songs, 
humour and socialism is 
typical of the genre. 

Steve hillage 's third solo 
album , ~' Novitation Radio" 
was recorded in Los Angeles 
and is about the role that radio 
plays' in our lives . In an 
interview with Harvey Kuberik 
in Melody Maker , Hillage 
explained how much of it was 
inspired by his first U.S. tour, in 
particular the influence of 
radio and telecommunications 
in the American lifestyle , its 
psychic telepathic symbolism 
and its relation both to telluric 
energy and to new-age technol-
ogy. 

It seems appropriate there-
fore , that this album was 
recorded at one of the world 's 
most advanced studios , 
Westlake Audio, and produced 
by Malcolm Cecil, who was 
responsible for Stevie Wonder's 
momentous " Innervisions," 
and c rea tor of the Ton to 
synthesizer, which features 
prominently on this record. 

The music of the a lbum has 
an impressive coherence and 
unity, and though the Canter-
bury influence is very much in 
evidence, Hillage avoids the 
finicky com plexity, highly 
sectionalized form that much of 
this kind of music takes , 
replacing it with a feeling of 
spaciousness and continuity, 
making sensitive use of the 
technology available to him. 
The range of colours of the 
guitar is quite fascinating, 
obtained by various treatments 
with synthesizer and foot 
pedals, and leads on from the 
instrument ' s new tambral 
qualities discovered by Phil 
Miller (Hatfield and the North) 
and Fred Frith (Henry Cow) . 
There is a coherence, too, in the

------through the album wnlch takes 

as its basis ~he number seven, 
the symbol of unity. 

The album was originally to 
be called " 7" as a reversal of 
" L", Hillage s previous record 
and many of the songs employ 
seven-beat measures and 
seven-bar structures . The 
cover has a picture of "The 
Chariot," No. 7 of the Tarot 
cards, which was the inspira-
tion for "Saucer Surfing." 

There are nine songs which 
explore various subjects 
relating to the broad theme 
suggested by the title, from by 
Jines to UFO's, including two 
songs entitled separately 
" Radio" and " Motivation.' The 
first is a tight, powerful number 
in a jazz-rock-funk vein where 
fragmentary vocal lines and 
instrumental sections interlock 
over the pounding bass and 
drums, but towards the end the 
music's rigidity gives way to a 
fluid guitar solo which builds 
from the long, sustained low 
notes to a climax of splintering, 
distorted chords. 

Unlike many rock guitarists, 
Hillage does not attempt to play 
as many notes in as short a time 
as possible. There is always a 
thoughtfulness, restraint and 
avoidance of cliches and the 
musical effect benefits as a 
result. " Radio" begins serenly 
with acoustic guitar and 
etheral sounds from the Touto 
synthesizer creating a musical 
analogy to the invisible , 
insubstantial world of radio 
waves. As the other instru-
ments enter and the texture 
be comes he a vier , a song 
emerges drawing analogies, 
this time in words between 
radio and psychic energy. 

" Wait One Moment" is a 
much simpler song, similar 
to things from Hillage's earlier 
albums, notable for its soaring, 
multi -tracked guitar lines 
reminiscent of the double lead 
guitar sound of Wishbone Ash. 
The truibral resources of the 
Tonto synthesizer are again 
demonstrated on " Searching 
for the Spark" where streams 
of rapid notes sweep the audio 
range in great waves over the 
driving bass line. Over this 
Hillage plays shenai, an Indian 
double reed instrument in a 
kind of wild ritual dance 
" Octave Doctors " is aT 
instrumental where hypnotic 
pulsating chords move through 
a seemingly endless sequence 
supporting the colourful , 
constantly changing sounds of 
guitar and synthesizer. _ 

" Motivation HadW ' is 
essentially studio music. Now 
that the recording techniques 
have reached such a level of 
sophistication that it is possible 
to create music that could 
never be reproduced " Jive," we 
must look upon the making of a 
record as an art in itself, and I 
believe this to be one of the 
finest examples of that art in 
recent months. The sparkling 
transformation of the old 
Buddy Holly / Rolling Stones 
classic " Not Fade Away ' 
which comes at the end of the 
album offers a Janus-like look 
into the past and future of rock 
music through the world of 
mass-communication. " Moti-
vation Radio" effortlessly 
fuses seemingly desparate 
elements, offering a defense of 
musicality of t he newest 
technology as well as the 
natural role of a music in this 
era which combines various 
instruments and styles regard-
less of source in time and place.

Brockett scores 23 in 77-64 loss Sports Schedule Most students leave the San Diego and campus area during 

the upcoming quarter break, but if you're in the neighborhood 
from December 10 to January 1, here 's what's going on in by Steve Gould 

Sports Editor 
Cal State Northridge held 

off a second haH rally led by 
Lee Brockett and John Cox to 
down UCSD 77-64 in a non-
conference varsity basket-
ball contest Tuesday night in 
the Main Gym. The Mata-
dors' Larry Singleton, a 6'4" 
senior forward , scored six of 

his 19 points on three 
consecutive second half shots 
in just two minutes to end the 
Tritons' comeback and drop 
UCSD's season record at 1-1. 

Coach Barry Cunni'ugham 
started S'S" Stan Hopper at 
center, replacing Peter Volk, 
who was suspended one game 
for missing practice on 
Sunday and Monday. Hopper, 
Brockett and Bob Frazier 
tried to control the boards for 
UCSD, but they got into foul 
trouble attempting to fill the 
space created by Volk's and 
Howard Grunloh's (still 
recovering from hospitaliza-
tion) absp.nce.

A technical foul called on 
UCSD for dunking in the pre-
game warmups allowed 
Northridge to take a 1-0 lead 
before the tip-off which they 
maintained throughout the 
entire forty minutes . When 
the Tritons managed to pull 
even twice in the first haH, 
CSUN's Mark Felix fired in 
t.wo 15 footers from the 
baseline to give his team the 
lead for good at 32-28 with

tbe cbaracter of bis social 
vision: the non-elite education-
al system, the autonomy of the 
People's Communes - Cbina's 
county-sized self-governln& 
rural units - and the tradition 
of popular checks on the power 
of the party and the govern-

large, paid staffs." 

CounciJ conflicts 
Leifer also talked briefly 

about the conflicts within the 
AS council. (The council is 
comprised of 12 representa-
tives of the four colleges, and 10 
commissioners elected on 
a campus wide basis . The Vice-
president chairs the weekly 
council meetings. Leifer, as 
president, does not sit on the 
council, but acts on legislation 
submitted to him by the 
council.) 

"If an AS official needs 
transportation, he can get an 
economy car," Leifer said of 
Drapeau 's use of student funds 
to rent a Monte Carlo and a 
Firebird Trans-Am on trips to 
UC Board of Regents meetings. 
" But Bob went too far. It won't 
happen again." 

or Bekken's impeachment 
charges, Leifer said, " They' re' 
almost a joke. Bekken's the 
only AS member who supports 
the impeachment char~es.··

The one and only Groucho 
has brought you 86 years of his 
fondest memories-in hundreds 
of photos and drawings. In post' 
ers and playbills. In his zaniest 
writings and routines. And in 
hilarious scenes with Chico, 
Harpo and leppo. 

For Groucho, this was a per' 
sonal collection. For Groucho 
lovers, it's a collector's item.

"How 
I found 

36 
extra 
days 
last year" 

1/ I used to be too 
uncomfortable to do 
much of anything when I 
had my menstrual 
period. It was like losing 
at least three days every 
month. Then, last year, I 
switched to Tampax 
tampons. Now I'm 
always on the go:' 

Making every day 
count is what Tampax 
tampons are all about. 
They eliminate chafing, 
bulk and bulges. In fact, 
once the tampon is prop-
erly in place, you can't 
even feel it's there. 

And Tampax 
tampons are uniquely 
designed to conform to 
individual vaginal con-
tours . Which means 
there's less chance of 
leakage or bypass. 

With Tampax 
tampons you get a lot 
more days out of the 
year. And a lot more fun 
out of life.
