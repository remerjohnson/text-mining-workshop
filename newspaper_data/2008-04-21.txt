Last week, the A.S. Programming 
Office released the lineup of acts 
playing at this 
year’s Sun God 
Festival, which 
will feature more 
bands to accom-
modate a longer, 
larger carnival-
style event.

Alternative 
rock band 
Coheed and 
Cambria will 
headline the fes-
tival on the main 
stage, where 
Sean Kingston 
will also play 
as the concert’s 
featured urban 
act. Three acts, 
two on the main 
stage and one on 
the north stage, remain unannounced 
due to contractual confidential-
ity. Programming Festival Director 
Garrett Berg said the remaining acts 

will be announced this week.
A handful of San Diego-based 

bands and DJs will play on the north 
stage, headlined by local new-age 
blues band Lady Dottie and the 
Diamonds. The midway stage cur-
rently features a trio of comedians, 
including Los Angeles native Laura 
Valdivia. Berg said his office is work-
ing to add more to the north, midway 
and main stages, but called this year’s 
program “much more diverse than 
any lineup before.”

“As with every year, we’ve had 
mixed reactions immediately follow-
ing the announcement,” Berg said. 
“But this year’s lineup is much longer 
and more extensive. We had three 
stages and a half-day’s worth of pro-
gramming to fill. Everything this year 
will be new, so we had a lot of adjust-
ing to do when it came to booking 
the acts.”

The new Sun God Festival will 
divide UCSD’s north campus into 
several zones of activity, including 
a street fair of vendors and student 
organizations along Hopkins Drive 
that programmers have dubbed “Sun

UC Lab Key in Nuclear Consolidation Plan

See SUN GOD, page 3

By Diana Tith
Staff Writer

Thirty-five miles from Santa Fe, N.M., the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory operates as one of two UC-
managed  nuclear weapons research facilities. As part of a 
proposal  to overhaul the structure of the nation’s nuclear 
stockpile, the National Nuclear Security Administration 
has selected LANL as a site for plutonium research and 
development. 

The proposal, called Complex Transformation, is an 
effort to renovate and alter the current U.S. nuclear-weapons 
complex. Currently, there are eight major facilities involved 
in nuclear-weapons safety, including LANL. Most of the 
buildings at these facilities, which are remnants of the Cold 
War era, have aged drastically and become too expensive 
to maintain. The proposal, therefore, aims to remedy this 
situation by merging nuclear materials operations to only 
five sites by 2012. 

Complex Transformation also intends to improve the 
efficiency and speed of the dismantling of weapons and 
will reduce the number of workers directly supporting 
weapons missions by 20 to 30 percent.

According to NNSA spokesman John Broehm, one 

reason for implementing the draft proposal is to address the 
significant decrease in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.

“The nuclear stockpile has almost been cut in half and 
we need to reflect that fact by consolidating the eight sites 
and knocking down the old buildings,” Broehm said. 

Broehm added that the work on plutonium would also 
have to be consolidated into one area and LANL would take 
on most of that work. 

Besides undertaking plutonium research and develop-
ment, LANL would also be involved in supercomputing and 
nuclear-weapons design and engineering. Additionally, the 
laboratory plans to reduce nuclear operations by 50 percent 
over the next 10 years.

NNSA chose LANL partly because of its longstanding 
involvement in plutonium operations. 

“LANL is one of the largest and newer research facilities 
that encompasses about 36 square miles,” LANL spokesman 
Kevin Roark said. “This is quite large when compared to 
the Berkeley National Laboratory, which is only one square 
mile.”

Many nonproliferation groups have criticized not only 
LANL’s operations, but also the Complex Transformation 
proposal itself. The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation founded 
the campaign UC Nuclear Free, with the goal of ending 
the university’s involvement in the development, produc-
tion and research of nuclear weapons at LANL and also 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Baja Governor Applauds 
Partnership With UCSD

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The governor of Baja California 
made his first official speech in 
California last week, commemorating 
a collaborative academic and research 
relationship formed between UCSD 
and el Colegio de la Frontera Norte 
in Mexico. An agreement signed by 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and 
COLEF President Tonatuih Cuillen 
puts current projects undertaken by 
the two universities under the auspices 
of UCSD’s Center for United States-
Mexican Studies. 

As part of the Charles Nathanson 
Lecture series by the School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies, Gov. José Guadalupe Osuna 
Millán spoke about the future of eco-
nomic relations between neighboring 
Baja California and California, touch-
ing on cross-border issues ranging from 
climate change to HIV prevention. 

The governor expressed his opti-
mism for the future of the partner-
ship between the United States and 
Mexico and showed a video called 
“Baja California: The Mexican Frontier

UCSD

Campus Gives College Tips 
to High School Students
UCSD is partnering with the 

California Student Opportunity and 
Access Program to present 10th- 
and 11th-grade students and par-
ents in southeast San Diego with 
“An Evening with UCSD,” an event 
that will provide information about 
college admissions, financial aid and 
top-paying jobs for graduates. 

During the event, which will be 
held April 22 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at 
the Elementary Institute of Science, 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox will wel-
come the students and their par-
ents after an introduction by City 
Councilman Tony Young. 

“This is an exciting opportunity 
for [UCSD] to meet with students 
and parents in their own commu-
nities, share information about the 
university and the details in navigat-
ing the college preparatory process,” 
Fox said in a statement.

Additional speakers include Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue, Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admission and Enrollment Services 
Mae W. Brown, Interim Director of 
Financial Aid Ann Klein and Associate 
Director of Career Services Craig 
Schmidt. 

Researchers Discover 
Mouse Skin Detects Oxygen 

Biologists at UCSD have recently 
found that mice can sense low levels 
of oxygen and regulate the produc-
tion of a hormone that produces red 
blood cells and facilitates adaptation 
to high-altitude, low-oxygen environ-
ments.

The research study, which 
appeared in the April 18 issue of the 
journal Cell, could significantly affect 
how physicians treat anemia and 
other diseases requiring stimulation in 
red-blood-cell production. The study 
clashes with the notion that mamma-
lian skin has little connection to the 
respiratory system. If the discovery 
can be tied to humans, it could dra-
matically influence the training and 
testing of endurance athletes dur-
ing this summer’s Olympic Games 
in Beijing, said  Randall Johnson, a 
biology professor who led the study. 

“We discovered that mammalian 
skin, at least in mice, responds to 
how much oxygen is above it and, 
by virtue of that response, chang-
es blood flow through the skin,” 
Johnson said in a statement. “This, 
in turn, changes one of the most 
basic responses to low oxygen that 
we have, which is the production of 
erythropoietin.”

UC Davis Hosts Picnic 
Day, Dachshund Race
During a 99-year-old celebration 

of animals and academics at UC 
Davis’ Picnic Day last week, thou-
sands of people crowded the cam-
pus’ Arc Pavilion to watch dachs-
hunds dressed in racing outfits com-
pete in a 50-yard dash.

Organizers estimated that 50,000 
people attended the festivities, which 
included events like the Doxie Derby, 
sheepdog trials and a battle of the 
bands. 

“I’ve only missed one since ’79,” 
Chris Carrere, a UC Davis grad 
who is now secretary of the Davis 
Chamber of Commerce board, said 
in a statement.

God Avenue.” Programmers also added 
other attractions to this year’s festi-
val, including pyrotechnics and LCD 
screens featuring student films and art.

The changes come after the pro-
gramming office launched an all-
campus review of the festival, hoping 
to curb concerns over its increasingly 
unsafe and unmanageable operations. 
The review culminated in the Sun 
God Planning Report, which stat-
ed major concerns about the high 
number of arrests and citations dur-
ing last year’s festival. Programmers 
responded by overhauling their safety 
measures, deciding this year to hire 
more expensive officers from other 
universities instead of local under-
cover police used in past festivals. 
A.S. President Marco Murillo and 
Berg requested funds from Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue to mitigate security costs that 
had nearly doubled this year, but 
their request was turned down. Rue 
said that the festival had reached an 
operational “tipping point,” citing last 
year’s logical event-planning flaps as 
reason to see the festival renovated.

“There are simple things that 
shouldn’t happen that did, like put-
ting your entrances and exits in the 
same areas,” Rue said in an interview 
with the Guardian after the report’s 
October release. “The festival needs 
to be about community just as much 
as it needs to be about safety and 
good management.”

Berg said the programming office 
is tapping all of its financial resources 
in an attempt to properly fund the 
larger festival.

for Successful Business” as an introduc-
tion to his speech. The video dem-
onstrated the economic viability of a 
relationship with Baja California, and 
touted its strengths such as the ability 
to remove obstacles for businesses and 
increasingly educate the workforce. 

“I would call it a great opportunity, 
rather than a challenge,” Osuna Millán 
said. 

In addition to discussing Baja 
California’s economic statistics, 
including the low unemployment 
rate and a 6.4-percent growth rate for 
2006 (which surpasses the national 
rate of 4.9 percent), the governor 
also talked about issues he believed 
deserved transnational attention. He 
spoke of the need to combat weap-
ons trafficking across the border, as 
well as his intent to work toward the 
increase of regional solidarity. 

“There must be absolute respect for 
the dignity of any person crossing the 
border,” he said in response to the con-
troversial border situation. 

Stormoen said the proposal contains 
provisions calling for the building 
of new facilities that would produce 
plutonium pits. These “pits” are the 
core of any nuclear warhead. 

“Complex Transformation is just 
a new political scheme cooked up 
by people friendly to the labs to see 
an increase in the budget at labs and 
more money going to the nuclear 
business,” Stormoen said.

Stormoen added that although 
the number of nuclear weapons on 
alert might be reduced, Complex 
Transformation and the UC-man-
aged nuclear laboratories violate 
the conditions of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. 

“Reducing the stockpile of nuclear 

weapons to the point where we could 
destroy the world two or three times 

over rather than eight times over is 
not meaningful reduction,” Stormoen 

said. “What would be meaningful 
reduction is actual nuclear disar-
mament according to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.” 

LANL, however, states on its Web 
site that it will not be expanding its 
plutonium-pit-manufacturing com-
plex and that the actual production 
of pits will be determined based on 
need. 

Complex Transformation is still 
in its public comment phase, dur-
ing which citizens are able to attend 
public hearings where they can voice 
their opinions on the draft proposal. 
The public comment period has been 
extended to April 30.

Nonaffiliate Dies On 
Campus in Apparent Suicide
By Reza Farazmand
Associate News Editor

A UCSD nonaffiliate died last 
week while sitting in a stopped 
vehicle in a Revelle College parking 
lot, an event police are calling an 
apparent suicide. 

The individual, a male whose 
name has not yet been released 
to the public, was discovered in a 
blue SUV at 12:49 a.m. on April 17 
in Lot 104, according to a police 
statement.

Witnesses allegedly told police 
that the individual was playing 
loud music and had been revving 
his car engine for several min-
utes before anyone approached the 
vehicle. 

The morning following the 
incident, Revelle College Resident 

Dean Malik Ismail sent an e-mail to 
all Revelle residents notifying them 
of what had occurred. 

Additionally, the e-mail 
informed residents that they and 
any other students affected by the 
incident would be provided with the 
opportunity to speak with psychol-
ogists from the campus Psychology 
and Counseling Services Office 
that evening. 

“The counselors are always 
available for students,” Ismail said. 
“We wanted to provide this as an 
opportunity if there were concerns 
that students had and to provide 
an opportunity to have counselors 
here to listen and to offer any sort 
of counseling support.”

Governor Responds to Free Trade Issues
▶ BAJA from page 1 Questions from the audience ranged 

from the ecological to the economic 
effects of the construction of new ports. 
One audience member acknowledged 
the increase in trade between the United 
States and Mexico as a result of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, 
but asked the governor what held back 
personal relationships between the two 
countries from growing at a similar rate 
over the past 15 years.

“While the free trade agreement has 
increased trade, human relationships 
haven’t increased to the same degree,” 
Osuna Millán said. “They may even 
have begun to deteriorate. I am going to 
focus on promoting a dignified rapport 
between the two nations.”

Another audience member ques-
tioned the recent warnings the U.S. 
government released about traveling 
to the Tijuana area and asked what 
the governor thought about the public 
safety of Baja California. Osuna Millán 
blamed the media for sensationalizing 
the crimes that took place and com-
pared the number of cars stolen daily 

from San Diego’s Fashion Valley that 
don’t appear in the news headlines to 
the crimes that occur daily in Tijuana. 

“There are more homicides per 
capita in Los Angeles, in Detroit, in 
New Orleans, each day than in Tijuana,” 
he said. “The media is overstating the 
problem. I don’t want this to become a 
stereotype of the city.”

Osuna Millán closed his speech with 
a final message about the future of the 
relationship between Baja California 
and California. 

“I have a vision of a region were 
both areas will thrive,” he said. 

In a press conference follow-
ing the speech, Executive Director of 
the Center for United States-Mexican 
Studies at UCSD Rene Zenteno called 
the agreement signed between UCSD 
and COLEF a long-awaited victory.

“It’s like they have been engaged for 
five years, and today the colleges were 
married,” Zenteno said.

OPINION
MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008

Have you ever met your soul mate? That other half you didn’t know was missing 
until it showed up and fit so per-
fectly into your unique mold, mak-
ing you feel an eerie comfort similar 
to getting lost in really loud, amaz-
ing music or going home to visit 
your childhood dog? I was a fresh-
man at UCSD when I first encoun-
tered Chipotle, and in the past three 
years — as the restaurant chain has 
greatly expanded, even taking up 
residence in my hometown — our 
flirtatious courting has evolved into 
true, euphoric love.

And that is why, as workers 
touch up the last bits of neon paint, 
new vendors move in and the Price 
Center expansion rolls forward to 
completion, I feel the need to rally 
for a Chipotle on campus. Now it’s 
true, I’m probably biased since we 
do have so much in common. (We’re 
both Mexican by name but, you 
know, not really. We’re both brutally 
efficient, yet sometimes at the cost 
of aesthetic neatness. And we can 
both be a little overwhelming to 
the faint of heart.) But I’m certainly 
not the only Chipotle enthusiast at 

UCSD — morning, noon and night 
the La Jolla Village Square loca-
tion is full of blue-and-gold sweat-
ered, book-bag toting Tritons. And 
our darling Chipotle, like a caring 
lover, even stays up late during those 
strenuous finals weeks to make sure 
we’re well fed.

The expansion will boast eight 
new food vendors, and while 
those look to include Burger King, 
Santorini Island Grill, the Living 
Room, a pasta place and an Asian 
tea shop (read: boba joint), there 
is still time to bring in our much-
needed burrito favorite — because 
the turnaround at Chipotle’s slower 
cousin Rubio’s is no longer worth its 
greasy selections.

Palay wrote he “served as the student 
co-chair of [ARSFAB] for the past three 
years” and that Athletic, Recreation and 
Sports Facility Advisory Board was cre-
ated in 2004.”

We created ARSFAB in 2005; its 
original charter is dated April 18. Palay 
didn’t attend an ARSFAB meeting 
until 2006. He has been the chair for 
more than two years, but nowhere near 
three.

Palay wrote, “Main Gym … is main-
tained completely by the university and 
does not use student funds.”

This is a forgivable mistake, but a 
major one. Main Gym and other sports 
facilities are funded by student fees 
— just not the RIMAC fee.

Palay wrote, “various student sur-
veys … including a 1997 Quality of 
Student Life Survey and last winter’s 
survey during the special election … 
have overwhelmingly supported … 
lounge and meeting-room spaces.”

On the 1997 survey, students rated 
meeting rooms below “Laundry/
Dry Cleaning,” an “Expansion of 
Groundwork Books” and a “Theater 
for Student Productions.” If that sur-
vey informs the RIMAC Annex, why 
doesn’t it have dry cleaners, a coop-
erative bookstore and a performance 
stage? Students indicated it was impor-
tant to expand lounges, but they also 
listed study areas, browsing libraries 
and co-ops as high priorities. The ques-
tion did not ask how recreation-facil-
ity fees should be spent, nor did it 
include any options related to sports 
or exercise. The Price Center expan-
sion, planned before the annex and 
using appropriate funds, includes over 
a dozen lounges and meeting rooms. In 
light of this, it’s not clear students still 
view lounges as a high priority at all, let 
alone for recreation fees.

The survey Palay mentioned asked 
students what they wanted in the 
RIMAC Annex, and their clear prefer-

ence was for recreation facilities — not 
convenience stores, cafes, lounges or 
meeting rooms.

Palay was referring to me when 
he mentioned “one member who is 
no longer on the board,” adding that 
“ARSFAB continually ruled against him 
by a large consensus.” While I was a 
member, the only decision ARSFAB 
made regarding the RIMAC Annex 
was that alcohol be sold there. I took 
no position, but even if I had, I wouldn’t 
have participated in the vote because 
Palay held it by e-mail in violation of 
ARSFAB’s rules. I pointed this out, 
but he proceeded regardless. As far as 
I know, ARSFAB under Palay never 
“ruled” in any sense of the word.

Referring to me again, Palay wrote, 
“his arguments were refuted by one of 
our GSA members, who could not rec-
ollect any controversy surrounding the 
RIMAC Annex since his appointment 
in winter 2007.”

Before Palay submitted his com-
mentary to the Guardian, the men-
tioned member wrote to him: “I do 
recall Dana objecting at least twice to 
the project, but by 2007 the plans had 
seemed rather cemented and ARSFAB’s 
role was more to choose the color of 
lipstick than the pig.” Despite this, Palay 
portrayed this member as supporting 
Palay’s false suggestion the annex was 
never a subject of contention.

Turks, Americans Leave Genocide by the Wayside
GUEST COMMENTARY

Imagine being a 93-year-old man who has been ignored and iso-lated all his life. His family and 
friends are gone. No one looks him in 
the eye as he hobbles down the street. 
No one knows his name or acknowl-
edges that he even exists. Nobody 
stops to chat. Everyone rushes right 
past him, saying and doing nothing 
— for nearly a century. 

The Armenian Genocide is that 
lonely old man, still aching to have 
his story told, his existence acknowl-
edged, his soul healed and put to rest.

The Armenian Genocide of 1915, 
commemorated every April 24 by 
Armenians around the world, was 
the systematic destruction by the 
Ottoman Empire of more than 1.5 
million Armenians. The Ottoman 
government’s desire at the time to 
“cleanse” minorities and create 
a Pan-Turkish state has been well 
documented. Records from then-
U.S. Ambassador to Ottoman Turkey 
Henry Morgenthau, from German 
missionaries and even from Turkish 
officials reveal that the Ottoman 
Empire was particularly intent on 
annihilating the Armenian race, 
which had become so successful 
within the country — a country with 
much territory previously belonging 
to ancient Armenia.

Government archives in Turkey 
and around the world have proof of 
these goals. Yet Turkey still denies that
an Armenian Genocide ever occurred, 
and many countries still side with 
Turkey when it claims that the deaths 
of 1.5 million Armenians were merely 
the result of a variety of World War I 

skirmishes and Armenian insurgen-
cies impossible to pin on the govern-
ment. 

Fortunately, France, Italy, 
Switzerland and other enlightened 
nations refuse to give into this lie, 
recently passing resolutions and leg-
islation acknowledging the Armenian 
Genocide — the first genocide of the 
twentieth 20th century, one that Adolf
Hitler studied in preparation for his 
own Jewish Holocaust. 

Andrew Tarsey, former Director 
of the Anti-Defense League of New 
England, was essentially fired last 
year for his comments acknowledg-
ing the Armenian Genocide but has 
inspired Jews and Armenians alike 
with his uncompromised integrity on 
this issue.

Momentum is shifting in other 
ways as well: U.S. House and Senate 
Resolution 106 acknowledging the 
Genocide, New York Life’s settlement 
of insurance-policy reparations to 
descendants of Armenian Genocide 
victims, more and more countries 
passing genocide legislation as men-
tioned, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District incorporating a new 
Armenian-Genocide curriculum into 
the schools. These are important 
steps.

Some Turkish scholars and art-
ists, like historian Taner Akcam of 
the University of Minnesota, are now 
speaking out about the Armenian 
Genocide and acknowledging that it 
did in fact happen — even dialoguing 
with their Armenian counterparts at 
academic conferences and panels.

Perhaps Turkey does not recog-

nize how much more respect it would 
gain worldwide if it did finally admit 
to the Ottoman Empire’s Armenian 
Genocide — perhaps its bid to join 
the European Union would even be 
helped. But Turkey also knows full 
well that the admission would result 
in a doling-out of financial repara-
tions that could nearly bankrupt the 
country. So, admitting the truth is too 
embarrassing and costly. 

Yet Turkey apparently doesn’t 
mind throwing millions of dollars at 
lobbyists and politicians worldwide 
to secure its anti-Armenian goals. 
Neither those efforts, however, nor 
vehement denial, can change the truth 
of history. Sadly, many Turks believe 
that the Armenian Genocide is a lie; 
saddest of all, younger generations 
of Turks are entirely ignorant of this 
period in their country’s history.

Some would say the aftermath of 
the genocide has even continued with 
a young Turkish nationalist’s assassi-
nation of beloved Armenian-Turkish 
journalist/editor Hrant Dink last 
year, seemingly for his pro-Genocide 
views. His son Arat Dink, assuming 
leadership of his father’s newspaper, 
was also convicted (like his father) 
under Turkey’s Article 301 of the 
penal code, for the “crime” of insult-
ing Turkishness. Never mind insult-
ing the truth.

Only an enlightened people are 
brave enough to explore and admit 
their mistakes and sins. Only an 
enlightened people are brave enough 
to be persecuted for their beliefs. And 
Armenians everywhere will keep fight-
ing until the truth sets the world free.

Stealing

Anatomy of a Sun God Lineup
By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

ON CAMPUS — In all likelihood, 
you were drying some tears after A.S. 
programmers announced a small-
name, albeit more eclectic lineup for 
this year’s Sun God Festival. But it’s 
a near certainty that the festival to 
you is like the Oscars, the Grammys 
or any other large-scale event:  Who 
knows how it happens? It just does.

Given that administrators pushed 
this year for the festival’s first sweep-
ing facelift in its 25-year history, pro-
grammers are hailing every financial 
resource to support larger costs and 
damn near everyone is lamenting 
the fact that Sean Kingston’s only 
listenable song is “Take You There,” a 
bubbly shit-fest where the puffed-up 
crooner reps his cred in both the hood 
and the tropics, students should now 
take a stronger, vested interest in the 
event that every Triton holds so dear.

The story of this year’s lineup 
could be published in reams of con-
text. But simply put, more small-
time acts were booked for a bigger 
festival, and the trend will continue 
until programming can scrounge up 
more funding to return the billing 
to its former headlining glory of T.I. 
and Ludacris. Even worse, program-
mers are now essentially trying to 
make more out of less, hoping to 
meet the rising costs of security and 
inflation without financial help from 
administrators. 

Now comes the context. 
Disappointment with the program-
ming office about this year’s head-
liner, Coheed and Cambria, may be 
alleviated with even just a superficial 
understanding of the booking pro-
cess. As the reporter on the Guardian’s 
programming beat, I’ve found such 

an understanding rather comforting; 
the complex, ultimately random, pro-
cess of booking acts helped me steam 
a little less two years back when emo-
trash My Chemical Romance was 
announced as the headliner, and feel 
blessed by a miracle last year when 
top-40 rapper T.I. played. 

Although popular belief has pro-
grammers engaging agents in purely 
wallet-related negotiations, the book-
ing process depends on an inextri-

cable bundle of factors, none that 
ultimately take precedence over the 
other. The artist must be available, 
which means they probably are on the 
concert circuit promoting new mate-
rial, students have to have expressed 
at least some interest in that artist and 
the price has to be right. 

Displeased students often con-
strue disappointment with the lineup 
as a problem with a stingy program-
ming office. Because if price was the 
only concern, why not devote more 
money to booking attention-hun-
gry acts and less to festival ame-
nities? For the right price, couldn’t 
UCSD have booked Mariah Carey 
to pump those famous pipes for her 
new album E=MC2? Could program-
mers have brought Ray-J to campus 

with his newest crowd-pleaser “Sexy 
Can I?” Or R.E.M. to promote their 
new album Accelerate? But program-
mers are already grasping at financial 
straws, relying on student volunteers 
and new staff to rope in sponsorships 
at both small business and corpo-
rate levels. Festival Director Garrett 
Berg said his office has been forced 
into a stage of creative cost cutting. 
Methods include partnerships with 
pizza restaurants for donations, so 
that the department won’t have to 
pay for food given to volunteers. If 
programmers are worried about the 
money needed to feed their own staff, 
then they are obviously a far cry from 
affording Mariah-caliber price tags.

However, the saddest episode in 
the Sun God saga brings administra-
tors into the fold. It was their fervent 
outcry, chronicled in the ridiculously 
extensive Sun God Planning Report, 
that sparked the move toward the 
larger, community-oriented and ulti-
mately more expensive festival. Now, 
programmers are left in the cold after 
receiving no financial aid from Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue to defray security costs. Rue had 
ironically been one of the most vocal 
supporters of security upgrades and a 
new festival, but her decision made it 
evident that students will be have to 
finish something that administrators 
started. 

This month’s activity fee survey 
is another harbinger: Students over-
whelmingly selected the Sun God 
Festival as their desired recipient of 
the campus’ next possible referen-
dum. That means that if you want a 
better Sun God lineup, you’ll have to 
pay for it.

MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

overpriced consumerism, I’m legiti-
mately excited for the expansion 
to be complete — and you should 
be too. Where else on campus are 
you going to find three different 
coffee spots squeezed in one plaza? 
And pasta and Asian teas have defi-
nitely gone unrepresented for far 
too long. Sure, Burger King is no 
In-N-Out, the Sunshine Market is 
more like a glorified 7-Eleven than 
the fresh-fruit stand we were prom-
ised and the Loft 
does threaten to 
be obnoxiously 
pinky-out, but 
you just can’t 
deny the awe-
some light-saber-
battle potential 
of the new Star 
Wars light-speed 
looking pathway. 

Good job, 
U n i v e r s i t y 
Centers, it looks 
like you may 
have done some-
thing right with this one. Now the 
only thing I’m left asking for is to 
be united with my love. And it’s not 
just me asking. 

Imagine, Tritons: It’s Tuesday 
and you get out of your class in 
Center Hall a little early at 12:15 
p.m., leaving you 15 minutes to grab 
some lunch before your next lecture 
in Warren. You definitely don’t have 
time to wait in Panda Express’ epic 
line only to rush out with a messy 
plate of rice and noodles that you’ll 

hardly be able to enjoy as you dash 
to class. But what if Chipotle was an 
option? The eatery’s entire concept  
is to get in and out quickly, and bur-
ritos are fabulously portable so you 
can easily scarf one on your way to 
class or snack on it discreetly — and 
without mess — as you take notes 
in the back.

The beauty of Chipotle is its glori-
ous self-containment. What if you’re 
doing dinner in a study lounge to 
catch up for an upcoming midterm? 

You could go with 
a messy burger 
or sandwich that 
would get on your 
hands and papers, 
or you could 
choose a delicious 
meal wrapped in 
itself — and foil, 
so you don’t even 
have to get up 
from studying to 
throw out your 
trash, just roll it 
up and lob it easily 
into a nearby bin.

And if nothing else convinces 
you, just think how well Chipotle’s 
arty-industrial feel would mesh 
with the expansion’s neon-green-
and-rough-mental decor — a match 
made in heaven. 

With the upcoming grand-open-
ing celebration, University Centers 
administrators are trying to send 
students the message that we are 
in control of our facilities. To that 
I say: Give me ricey-cheesy-guaca-
mole goodness or give me death!

SITE SEEN Self-Realization Fellowship Temple and Meditation Gardens
For students looking to release pent-up midquarter stress, a trip to the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple 
and Meditation Gardens in Encinitas, 
about a 20-minute drive north of La Jolla, 
is one such possible outlet. The place’s 
prime meditation area, next to the temple, 
which is visible from the Highway 101 
by its large gold spires, is the Meditation 
Gardens.

The gardens, while not spatially impres-
sive, provide a calming atmosphere, com-
plete with various local and exotic plants 
and a koi pond with impressively large 
fish. There are also stone benches and 
open areas that overlook the ocean, which 
serve as comfortable and calming medita-
tion spots. 

While the gardens are a tranquil sanc-
tuary for those looking to escape their 
noisy roommates, the site is serious about 
providing a consistently relaxing environ-

ment. A sign at the entrance of the gardens 
warns against cell phones, large cameras 
and improper conduct. Encinitas locals 
are usually sprinkled around the scene, 
meditating on the various benches and 
soaking up the soothing, subtle sounds of 
the ocean. Unfortunately, hoards of tour-
ists occasionally interrupt the natural feel 
of the surroundings. 

A 71-year-old hermitage located on 
the left of the gardens is open for viewing 
Tuesdays through Sundays, and tends to 
promote a lot of unwanted touristy traffic. 
But despite the possible crowds, it’s still 
easy to find a road less traveled by where 
you can procure tranquility. 

For those even more committed to peace 
and quiet, the Self-Realization Fellowship 
runs daily and weekend retreats. However, 
the program asks that participants first 
learn about SRF by taking lessons and 
make reservations in advance. The week-

end retreats provide vegetarian meals and 
housing accommodations, which are pro-
vided with a suggested donation of $85 a 
day during the week and $100 a day for 
the organized weekend stays. All retreat 
activities are conducted by the monks and 
nuns of the SRF monastic order. 

Whether you stay for a few hours 
or a few days, when the stress hits and 
the roommate ruin takes hold, the Self-
Realization Fellowship Temple and 
Mediation Gardens can serve as a calming 
and reflective solution.

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN

A nimal rights were a source of debate long before the UC system was formed, but over 
the last five years, actions taken by 
both sides have escalated, bringing 
the issue to a head with increas-
ingly violent animal-rights protests 
and stringent new UC-sponsored 
legislation. 

The first major victory for ani-
mal-rights groups in the recent past 
occurred in 2003. Protesters gath-
ered outside UCSD’s Basic Sciences 
Building on Feb. 19 to challenge a 
voluntary School of Medicine dog 
lab for freshmen. The lab used 
24 privately bred dogs, valued at 
$576 each, for a half-day experi-
ment involving vivisection and 
ending with the euthanization of 
the animals. Fifty out of 120 medi-
cal school students opted to skip 
the quarter’s first lab, and the lab 
was canceled completely in August 
2003.

Three years later, in 2006, UCLA 
began experiencing its first major 
violent protests, having been the 
site of many nonviolent marches in 

previous years. 
According to an anonymous July 

11 communique released by the 
North American Animal Liberation 
Press Office, the Animal Liberation 
Front placed a Molotov cocktail on 
UCLA researcher Lynn Fairbanks’ 
doorstep on June 30 as retaliation 
for “breeding monkeys for painful 
addiction experiments.” However, 
a statement released by the FBI did 
not confirm that Fairbanks was 
the target of the attack and said 
the incendiary device — actually 
placed on the doorstep of Fairbanks’ 
70-year-old neighbor — failed to 
ignite.

In February 2007, the Burnham 
Institute for Medical Research, the 
Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 
the Scripps Research Institute 
and UCSD formed the San Diego 
Research Ethics Consortium. As 
of December 2007, all four institu-
tions have adopted a common eth-
ics training requirement, offered 
through SDREC. Courses focus on 
the ethics of stem-cell research as 
well as other ethical issues such as 

social responsibility and the treat-
ment of human and animal sub-
jects. 

The UCLA protests returned 
with full force on June 24, 2007. 
An incendiary device, along with 
one gallon of fuel, was found 
next to UCLA researcher Arthur 
Rosenbaum’s vehicle. NAALPO 
press officer Jerry Vlasak said 
Rosenbaum “glues steel coils onto 
the eyes of primates,” and a group 
calling itself the Animal Liberation 
Brigade claimed responsibility in a 
June 27 communique released by 
NAALPO. 

According to Newsweek, 
Rosenbaum’s wife received a pack-
age weeks later containing animal 
fur and razor blades from someone 
claiming to be with ALF, threaten-
ing, “What he does to animals, we 
will do to you.” 

ALF also claimed responsibil-
ity for flooding UCLA researcher 
Edythe London’s Beverly Hills, 
Calif. home on Oct. 20. The group 
inserted a hosepipe into a bro-
ken window and reportedly caused 

more than $20,000 in water dam-
age.

Two months later, on Dec. 5, the 
UCSD School of Medicine complex 
was evacuated for seven hours when 
former UCSD employee Richard 
Sills Jr. threatened to detonate mul-
tiple explosives unless all animals 
used in UCSD research facilities 
were released. The bomb threat, 
centered on a suspicious package 
found in the Leichtag Biomedical 
Research Building, was ultimately 
determined to be a hoax.

Then on Feb. 5, 2008, London 
was targeted again, this time with 
an incendiary device left at her 
home. Although the device did 
ignite and cause damage, no one is 
believed to have been present when 
the incident occurred.

UCLA responded to this latest 
attack by filing a lawsuit on Feb. 21 
aimed at stopping the threats. Los 
Angeles County Superior Court 
Judge Gerald Rosenberg granted 
a temporary restraining order 
against the UCLA Primate Freedom 
Project, ALF, ALB and five indi-

viduals believed to affiliate with the 
groups. According to a UCLA press 
release, under the order, the defen-
dants are prohibited from harassing 
UCLA personnel or coming within 
50 feet of them during a demon-
stration. It also requires extremists 
to remove personal information 
about researchers from their Web 
sites.

“We’re dealing with terrorist 
organizations and people who are 
knowingly involving themselves 
with these terrorist organizations,” 
said John Hueston, a lawyer for 
UCLA, in a Feb. 27 Newsweek arti-
cle. 

Director of the UCLA Primate 
Freedom Project Jean Green 
told Newsweek she would com-
ply with the restraining order but 
said, “We’re not going to just lay 
down.” Green has since removed 
the researchers’ addresses from her 
Web site, but reportedly hinted to 
Newsweek that she may continue 
the fight through e-mail.

MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

At the preschool, Peter, a refugee from South Sudan who looks 16 and shows a 
shy disposition around other adults, 
teaches refugee children how to 
write English letters by rote, point-
ing at the often incorrect characters 
on a small chalkboard and shouting 
out the name for the students to 
repeat. His “big F” is crossed fully 
at both lines. 
He began learn-
ing English and 
Arabic himself 
when he arrived 
in Cairo only a 
few years ago. 
The other teach-
ers know even 
less English than 
Peter.

In Ain Shams, a Cairo suburb 
in the north of the city where many 
refugees have settled, the Sudanese 
Community Development Project  
has established two schools to ser-
vice the needs of refugee children. 
The education center — a small, 
white brick, two-story building with 
five classrooms and a grassy court-
yard — holds classes for students 
from ages six to 12 in the mornings, 
and for those ages 13 to 22 in the 
afternoons. A three-minute walk 
from the center stands a small two-
room building that acts as a pre-
school for over 100 other students. 

Only one volunteer worked 
with the school last semester, 
Northwestern University junior 
Meaghan Beatty, and even she could 
only show up sporadically due to 
her own class schedule. Most stu-
dents participate in a well-known 
program called Students Taking 
Action for Refugees, which pro-
vides classes taught by American 
University in Cairo student volun-
teers for the refugee community in 
Cairo. Since STAR has such promi-

nence on campus, many students 
never look into the opportunities to 
work with refugee children.

The need for volunteers at pri-
mary schools is even greater now 
than it has been in the past, and the 
volunteer network has been slow in 
adjusting to the demand. In the past 
few years, nongovernmental organi-
zations that have traditionally sup-

ported Sudanese 
refugees in Cairo 
have moved to 
South Sudan in 
response to the 
brokered peace 
between the 
A r a b - M u s l i m 
north and the 
Christian south, 

taking much-needed funding from 
Egyptian school centers and using 
it to rebuild Sudan’s ravaged infra-
structure.

Samuel Monyping, headmaster 
of the SCDP education center and 
a refugee from Southern Sudan, sits 
at the computer in his office most 
days, wearing silver wire-rimmed 
glasses and a blue polo. Like most 
refugees in the area he tries to dress 
professionally. Monyping is in the 
middle of business planning, not 
only for the future of the educa-
tion center, but for development in 
South Sudan as well. In Cairo, he is 
struggling to maintain the educa-
tional facilities that are desperately 
needed. From Cairo, he is working 
with colleagues who will soon head 
to South Sudan where he is part of 
a small group trying to rebuild the 
community by establishing schools 
and medical facilities. 

“We have educated people [in 
Sudan], but we don’t have experi-
ence,” Monyping said. “Our gov-
ernment there has no experience 
because they are fighters. Fighting 
and developing are different … we 

need to team up with NGOs who 
can train us.”

The presence of NGOs in South 
Sudan is not an issue with so many 
establishing themselves in the area, 
but many refugees are not returning 
home.

Despite the peace agreement 
between North and South Sudan, 
which has attracted many NGOs, 
refugees are still wary of the move 
back due to the difficulties they 
will face among the devastation of 
the more than 20-year conflict. In 
Cairo, refugees live in apartments 
and enjoy available services such as 
hospitals and schools, which South 
Sudan still lacks in adequate capac-

ity because of the war’s indiscrimi-
nate destruction. Furthermore, 
many remain skeptical that the 
peace will even hold.

“There is still a tumor in our 
spirit,” Monyping said. “There is 
fighting 21 years, so all we feel is to 
fight. We need a change, a change 
from inside to outside.”

Due to the large number of 
Sudanese reluctant to return home, 
the number of children in need of 
education continues to grow within 
the refugee community. Before 2006, 
these children didn’t even have for-
mal centers and many went without 
schooling due to Egypt’s reserva-
tions to the United Nations 1951 

Refugee Convention, to which it is 
a signatory. Egypt, as permitted by 
the United Nations, abstained from 
allowing refugees rights to employ-
ment or public education, which 
were called for in the convention. 
Because of this, until 2006, they 
were unable to form organizations, 
crippling the chance of receiving 
charitable donations from many 
organizations.

10 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008

Three days later, on Feb. 24, 
six masked intruders attempted to 
force their way into a UC Santa 
Cruz researcher’s residence and fled 
after a confrontation that involved 
a physical attack on the researcher’s 
husband. 

 “An attempted home inva-
sion by masked perpetrators is 
not free speech — it is a criminal 
act that threatens, intimidates and 
stifles academic freedom,” UCSC 
Chancellor George Blumenthal said 
in a statement. 

In March, UC Berkeley cam-
pus officials followed suit and said 
they were attempting to sue for a 
restraining order against informally 
organized activists who stage week-
ly demonstrations outside at least 
six Berkeley researchers’ homes. 

“Calling a person an animal 
abuser and a puppy killer is pro-
tected speech,” said animal-rights 
attorney Christine Garcia, accord-
ing to a March 5 article in the Daily 
Cal. “Constitutionally protected 
speech is not harassment.” 

Later that same month, the UC 
system announced it is seeking to 
expand its UCLA restraining order 
to a permanent systemwide injunc-
tion, protecting all 10 UC cam-
puses from the defendants named 
in the temporary restraining order 
granted in February. 

Currently, the UC system 
is sponsoring an extensive state 
assembly bill aimed at protecting 
its researchers from animal-rights 
groups. The bill — the California 
Animal Enterprise Protection Act, 
Assembly Bill 2296 — is authored 
by Assemblyman Gene Mullin 
(D-South San Francisco) and was 
passed by a 9-0 vote in the state’s 
judiciary committee on April 17. 

According to an analysis 
released by the judiciary commit-
tee, the bill prohibits posting pri-
vate information, such as a home 
address, telephone number or pic-
ture, about any animal enterprise 
employee on the Internet. An “ani-
mal enterprise,” as defined by the 
bill, would not only include non-
profit and academic organizations 
involved in animal research and 
testing but many commercial busi-
nesses engaged in analytical testing 

and product development.
Anyone who attempts to interfere 

with an animal enterprise with acts 
including, but not limited to, non-
violent intimidation and destroying 
property would be guilty of a mis-
demeanor. Depending on the act, 
offenders could face up to one year 
in a county jail and a fine of up to 
$25,000, with fines being increased 
for subsequent offenders.

The committee’s analysis also 
said the bill “proposes, apparent-
ly in unprecedented fashion, that 
the employer of an alleged victim 
would have standing to sue [for 
damages and injunctive relief ] even 
if the person actually aggrieved 
chooses not to sue.” 

The committee warned the defi-
nition of “animal enterprises” may 
be too general, setting a prece-
dent for extending protections to 
controversial enterprises such as 
tobacco and oil companies.

Civil liberties groups such as 
the American Civil Liberties Union 
have protested the bill, claiming it 
may prohibit the posting of accu-
rate information on the Internet 
and carries criminal penalties for 
conduct related to public protest.

Vlasak expects both the restrain-
ing order and the legislation in 
progress will have no effect on the 
activity of underground organiza-
tions such as ALF. 

“If someone’s willing to risk 20 
years of prison by … burning a 
building used for animal torture, I 
don’t think they’re going to worry 
about a silly restraining order that 
UCLA cooks up,” Vlasak said. “The 
same goes for AB 2296.”

He attributed the steadily rising 
numbers of animal rights protests 
and attacks over the last five years 
to the ineffectiveness of peaceful 
protests. 

“I think out of frustration of 
legal means, with passing laws, with 
peacefully protesting, with writing 
letters to congressmen — all those 
sorts of things — after seeing those 
techniques frustrated I think people 
have said ‘Well, if this doesn’t work, 
then … we should try something 
different,” Vlasak said. “And that’s 
when I think groups like the ALF 
and other organizations step up to 
the plate and say, ‘… We’re going to 

make sure that you’re not going to 
ignore us.’”

Vlasak said that although ALF 
has a specific set of guidelines 
in place — allowing for property 
damage, the liberation of animals 
and economic sabotage — they 
denounce violence toward humans 
or animals. 

However, he said, “Other orga-
nizations don’t have those guide-
lines.”

Vlasak also argued the UC sys-
tem is mistakenly funding unneces-
sary research that could be used for 
legitimate forms of treatment.

“It’s ridiculous UC continues to 
waste all this taxpayer money and 
inflict an unimaginable amount of 
suffering on animals when they 
could be doing the right thing 
and promoting health for human 
beings,” he said.

However, UC President Robert 
C. Dynes argued otherwise in an 
April 10 letter written to Dave 
Jones, the chair of the assembly 
judiciary committee.

“Radiation therapy and other 
cancer treatments, the development 
of vaccines, organ transplantation 
and many mental health treatments 
have all resulted in part from work 
done on animals,” Dynes said. 
“When such work is disrupted by 
the actions used by extreme ani-
mal-rights activists, the deleterious 
impact on important research can 
… delay the development of greatly 
needed and potentially lifesaving 
therapies.”

Dynes maintained the bill is 
not about limiting protestors’ free 
speech, but keeping researchers 
and their families safe.

“This legislation is an impor-
tant step toward ensuring that state 
prosecutors and law enforcement 
officials have the tools they need 
to prevent increasingly threatening 
and destructive tactics employed 
by extreme animal-rights activists 
without jeopardizing legitimate and 
lawful expressions of free speech,” 
he said.  

AB 2296 will be heard with-
in the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee in the next few weeks.

altered its policy in the handling of 
refugees, particularly the Sudanese. 

According to a Washington Post 
report, the protest spanned over 
three months and involved near-
ly 3,500 Sudanese who were told 
by the United Nations they were 
unable to be relocated to the West 
and had the choice of remaining 
in Cairo or returning to war rid-
den South Sudan. Massive protests 
and vigils took 
place after more 
than two dozen 
refugees were 
killed during 
police interven-
tion against the 
sit-in. Several of 
the victims were 
only children, 
trampled during 
the chaos.

In the wake 
of the tragedy 
downtown, and 
for the first time, 
Sudanese refu-
gees were able to 
legally establish 
education centers. As permanent 
refugees and the SCDP took this 
opportunity, their schools — which 
had been in place unofficially since 
2001 — gained official status. 

Today, more than 500 refugees 
are enrolled in classes through the 
education center and preschool. Six 
days a week, at 9:30 a.m., the young-
er students take a break to play 
in the courtyard, eat home-packed 
sandwiches and look through their 
studies.

Most kids laugh and play in 
the courtyard. Some remain in the 
classrooms but are just as playful. 
When my camera came out, crowds 
gathered for pictures and clamored 

to get a glance at their photos. Tugs 
at my pants and shouts across the 
grass called for more pictures, more 
attention. I felt a playful spirit, a 
youthful optimism I can only hope 
lasts longer than a few years.

Many of these children will 
remain in Cairo permanently, with 
refugee status. Even if the situation 
clears up in Sudan, and Sudanese 
begin heading home, Monyping said, 
there will always be more displaced 

people in Cairo 
who need school-
ing. Palestinian 
and Iraqi refugees  
require education 
as well.

Despite the 
need, money 
is running out. 
Funding is not 
coming in, and 
the school can 
barely afford to 
pay teachers their 
already meager 
wages, with which 
these refugees are 
struggling to sur-
vive themselves. 

However, Monyping remains opti-
mistic and dedicated.

“We want this program to go 
forward because we want to help 
refugees — Sudanese, Kenyan, 
Palestinian and Iraqi,” he said. “We 
are refugees, we know the situation 
well and this school will be open 
until the refugees leave Cairo. … 
Little by little, things are chang-
ing. This school is open because of 
refugees but everything depends on 
the money, on funding. Prices are 
rising, rent is high.”

Hockett said. “We played strong in 
the beginning and dominated the 
whole game … it didn’t really hit 
me that it was my last home game 
because we still have conference 
coming up.”

If the Tritons hope to do well in 
the conference tournament, they 
are going to have to go through 
UC Davis and Loyola Marymount 
University. The Tritons proved that 
they could beat LMU in the pre-
vious meeting between the two 
teams.

“We’ve known all season that 

they were going to be the teams to 
beat,” Hockett said.

The WWPA Championship will 
take place from April 25 through 
April 27 in Los Angeles. If the Tritons 
win the championships they will 
advance to the NCAA tournament.

“I think we’re in a good place 
going into conference,” Bocian said. 
“We’re coming off a strong win 
against LMU and if we continue 
to execute our offense, we’ll be in 
good shape.”

were really gunning for us and hit 
the ball well all game.” 

In game one, senior lefthander 
Melissa Ward was uncharacteristi-
cally ineffective and did not make 
it out of the second inning after 
giving up five early runs. The Triton 
bullpen bailed out Ward, as junior 
Christine Zankich and senior Nicole 
Fullerton combined to give up only 
one run over five plus innings. 

UCSD’s offense finally came alive 
in the fifth inning when sopho-
more catcher Nicole Saari, senior 
second-baseman Danielle Lukk 
and freshman second-baseman 
Jennifer DeFazio strung together 
three straight hits to pull within 
5-1. Woofter then stepped in and 
crushed a three-run homerun to 
bring UCSD within one run.

“We were still down by a few 
runs so everyone was hoping to just 
string together a few hits,” Woofter 
said. “Especially going against 
[Humboldt State’s] Lizzy Prescott 
last week, the Dominguez pitcher 
was really slow, and we were all hav-
ing trouble waiting on her pitches. 
So right before I went up to the 
plate I was telling myself to keep my 
weight back and hit the ball hard 
on the ground; luckily it ended up 
going out.” 

The 5-4 score after the fifth 
inning was as close as the Tritons 
would get, and the Toros held on for 
a 6-4 win. 

“Coach wasn’t mad at us, she 
was just upset that we didn’t catch 
up to the pitcher sooner,” Woofter 
said. “She was really positive, tell-
ing us that we could come out even 
after the second game and get our 
momentum right back.”

The Tritons took Gerckens’ mes-
sage to heart and in the first inning 
of the second game played funda-
mental small ball to jump to an early 
lead. Woofter coaxed a walk out 
of Toro pitcher Kristin Tanaka and 

was moved to second on a sacrifice 
bunt by freshman outfielder Katrin 
Gabriel before junior centerfielder 
Allison May roped an RBI double to 
give UCSD a 1-0 lead. 

Again in the fifth inning, the 
Tritons were able to manufacture a 
run in a way that would make any 
National League manager proud. 
Freshman infielder Amanda Eliades 
opened the inning with a walk and 
was sacrificed over to second by 
DeFazio. Lukk got her second hit of 
the game, a single down the third-
base line, to put runners at the 
corners and Eliades scored from 
third on Woofter’s sacrifice fly for 
a 2-0 lead. 

An unearned run in the sixth 
was all that Dominguez Hills could 
muster off of Triton junior start-
er Lauren Chastain, who threw a 
dominant complete game in her 
best outing of the year. Chastain 
improved her record 10-4 with her 
seventh complete game of the sea-
son in UCSD’s eventual 2-1 win. 

“That second game was definitely 
a must-win game and really helped 
add some confidence to the team,” 
Gerckens said. “Now the biggest strug-
gle for us is having confidence; we are 
our own toughest opponent. We have 
confidence in the team, but right now 
they have to do this on their own. 
Its up to them, I believe in them, the 
coaching staff believes in them, but in 
the end its about the players out on the 
field believing in themselves.”

The Tritons celebrated Senior 
Day on April 20, honoring Ward, 
Lukk, Fullerton, third-baseman 
Jenny Maze and outfielder Randelle 
Bundy. After a ceremony prior to 
the first game, the seniors took con-
trol of the afternoon, and guided 
the Tritons to 1-0 and 8-5 wins, two 
huge victories to regain the sea-
son’s shifted momentum with only 
one California Collegiate Athletic 
Association series left in the regular 
season.

In game one, Ward threw a com-
plete-game shutout and Maze pro-
vided what proved to be the game-
winning run with her RBI triple in 
the bottom of the sixth inning. Ward 
and Maze are strong athletes who 
have had historic UCSD careers and 
the wins were just as much of a 
home sendoff for them as it was for  
family and friends in attendance. 

The win was the 61st in Ward’s 
illlustrious Triton career, making 
her UCSD’s all-time wins leader. 
Ward’s ninth shutout of the year 
pushed her season record to 14-12 
and further extended her own all-
time complete game record.

The Senior Day magic continued 
in game two when a two-run blast 
from Maze ignited a four-run first 
inning and the Tritons cruised to an 
8-5 win. Maze’s first-inning blast, 
which easily cleared the right field 
fence, was the 33nd of her career.
Lukk picked up three stolen bases 
to go along with her two hits and 
an RBI. 

Fullerton got the start on the 
mound and picked up three strike-
outs in her solid three plus innings. 
Bundy went 1-for-3 in the game 
with a smash double and a stolen 
base of her own. 

The southpaw Ward, a pitcher by 
trade, was given a Senior Day pres-
ent and was alowed to get a pinch-
hit at-bat in the second inning, the 
first plate appearance of her four-
year career. Ward showed the poise 
of a veteran slugger and in a two-
strike count sliced an infield single 
to thirdbase.

Next, the Tritons will take on San 
Francisco State in their last regular 
season series of the year. With their 
record at 31-19 (14-14 CCAA), the 
final games will be crucial to allow 
UCSD to take momentum into the 
conference championships on May 1.

“Meister and Rubens were a won-
derful team that got to No. 1 in the 
nation,” Placek said. “Eric is such a 
smart doubles player who has helped 
me with the ins and outs of what it 
takes to become a better player at the 
net, something that’s key for doubles. 
We are constantly improving as a team 
each and every day, and I think this 
hard work will pay off in the postsea-
son.”

In the second doubles spot, soph-
omore Bijam Moallemi and Negishi 
combined to take out Connor Olson 
and Jeff Stollberg by the same 8-2 
score. UCSD dropped the third dou-
bles match by an 8-4 score, with the 
combo of senior Alex Whitmore and 
sophomore Brandon Low falling to 
Logan Bailey and Jordan Smith from 
Sonoma State.

Moallemi and Rubens continued 
their great play at the top of the singles 
ladder with routine victories. Playing 
at the top spot, Moallemi defeated 
Muesse 6-3, 7-6, while Rubens looked 
dominant in dispatching Olson 6-2, 6-
1. Negishi took part in the match of the 

day at the No. 3 spot, losing a nail biter 
to Stollberg, 6-2, 4-6, (10-7). Placek also 
lost a tough three setter, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, to 
McNulty. However, Low and freshman 
Vincent Nguyen were able to clinch 
the UCSD victory at the fifth and sixth 
spots with clutch performances. Low 
had no problem in dismantling Jeremy 
Heckley, 6-3, 6-2, and Nguyen took 
control of his match against Quan Vu 
after a difficult first set to win 7-6, 6-2 
for UCSD’s sixth match win of the day.

After winning their first match 
against a lesser Division-II power, the 
Tritons set out to take care of business 
against UC Davis, a Division-I team. 
The match was close throughout, with 
Davis just squeaking by with a 5-4 win. 
In defeat, the Tritons put together a 
great performance in another match 
that will serve UCSD well as it prepares 
for the postseason. In doubles, Rubens 
and Placek continued their success at 
the top spot, beating Daniel Elefant and 
Michael Reiser 8-6. The Aggies would 
win the other two doubles matches with 
an 8-5 win for Henri Landes and Justin 
Garcia over Moallemi and Negishi at 
No. 2 and a 8-4 victory for Nic Amaroli 

and Kevin Liang over Whitmore and 
freshman Armaun Emami, making 
their debut as a doubles team at the 
third spot.

Singles proved to be extremely com-
petitive, with the tie’s final result lying 
in the balance. Moallemi and Rubens 
once again anchored the Tritons at the 
top two spots in singles, winning in rou-
tine fashion. Moallemi beat Landes 6-4, 
6-4, while Rubens beat Reiser 6-4, 7-6. 
At the third singles spot, Negishi lost 
to Garcia, 7-6, 6-2, losing momentum 
after a tough first set. Placek and Low 
fell in rough three-set matches. Placek 
battled back from an early deficit, but 
lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to Elefant while Low 
fell 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 to Nick Lopez at the 
fifth spot that broke the tie and decided 
the match. Finally, Nguyen had little 
trouble beating Nick Lee 6-4, 6-2 at the 
last singles spot. Even with the loss, the 
Tritons showed that without Meister, 
they will still be a tough team to handle 
in the West Regional, which will begin 
in a little less than two weeks.

MEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons hit the 
road for Northern California to play 
their final two matches of the regular 
season before the West Regional com-
mences on May 8. Despite the sudden 
and unexpected departure of senior 
cornerstone Blake Meister last week, 
the Tritons managed to put together 
a solid performance in their matches, 
splitting the road trip against Sonoma 
State University and UC Davis.

According to junior Kaz Negishi, 
Meister left for personal reasons but 
the team is doing its best to progress 
without him.

“It was tough for Blake to leave 
us at such a critical point in the sea-
son,” said Negishi, who will shoulder 
most of the responsibility for Meister’s 
absence, being one of three players 
who must move up in the ladder. 
“Everybody on the team feels the pres-
sure of playing against improved com-
petition, but I’m confident our guys 
won’t be fazed by the challenge that’s 
been presented to us.”

In their first match without their 
celebrated senior, the Tritons started

SOFTBALL — Coming off of their 
most frustrating weekend series of 
the 2008 season, a four-game sweep 
at the hands of Humboldt State 
University, the Tritons rebounded 
with a hard-fought doubleheader 
split against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on April 18. The two games 
were the remainder of a rain-short-
ened series earlier in the year when 
the Tritons took two games from 
the visiting Toros. This time around, 
Dominguez Hills came out firing, 
taking the opening game 6-4 before 

UCSD came back to win the night-
cap 2-1.

The series split was somewhat 
disappointing for the Tritons, who 
are starting to expect more out of 
their team, but even with the open-
ing-game loss, the Tritons main-
tained their composure to rebound 
in the second game.

“We were pretty surprised that 
Dominguez even took the first 
game,” freshman shortstop Sarah 
Woofter said. “Earlier in the year we 
won two pretty easy games against

TRACK & FIELD — Competing in 
three different events from April 16 
to 20, UCSD was able to maneuver 
numerous meets with flying colors en 
route to setting many NCAA provi-
sional marks and giving athletes invalu-
able experience in the waning weeks 
of the regular season. Although the 
hectic week’s format was unusual for 
the Tritons, the coaching staff helped 
organize all of the athletes to maximize 
their performances.

“Most people competed at only 
one meet, and were able to focus 
on their events,” junior distance 
runner Jake LeVieux said. “Practice 
was a little scrambled, but it didn’t 
disorient the team in my opinion. 
The coaches planned it out so no 
one was too burdened and everyone 
knew what they were doing.”

On April 16, the Tritons traveled 
to Walnut, Calif., for the prestigious 
Mt. SAC Relays, where they faced 
off against some of the top collegiate 
and professional teams in the nation. 
Sophomore jumper and hurdler Linda 
Rainwater led the Tritons at day one 
of the relays by totaling 4,998 points 
to earn her a 13th place finish.

While Rainwater was at the meet in 
Walnut, three other Tritons were par-
ticipating in the California Invitational 
held at Azusa Pacific University. 
Freshman Stephanie LeFever earned 
a seventh-place spot in the open hep-
tathlon, good enough for second-best 
in the all-time UCSD record book 
and gaining her an NCAA Division-
II provisional qualifying mark. Senior 
Kayleigh Knudson set a personal best 
mark by amassing 4,528 points en 
route to a 17th-place finish and the 
third-best mark in school history. The 
lone representative for the men’s team 
at the California Invitational was soph-
omore multi-event runner Andrew 
Van Straaten, who scored 6,169 points

The highlight of the tough, five-
day stretch was senior distance run-
ner Emily McGregor running an 
automatic national qualifying time 
of 35:26 in the 10,000-meter race 
on day two of the Mt. SAC relays. 
McGregor had never ran the race 
before, yet in her debut was able to 
set the all-time UCSD record for 
the event. On the same day at the 
competition, senior distance runner 
Dianne Dunn eclipsed a national 
qualifying mark in the 5,000-meter 
race with her time of 17:39.38.

UCSD Tops Seawolves 
but Falls to D-I Aggies
Without top senior Meister, 
Tritons beat Sonoma State 
6-3 and barely fall 5-4 
to UC Davis to close out 
regular season schedule.

By Janani Sridharan 
Associate Sports Editor

WATER POLO — The No. 16 Tritons 
ended their regular season with 
a 6-4 win over California Baptist 
University on April 17 in an impor-
tant win on Senior Night. With 
the victory, the Tritons will enter 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Championship Tournament having 
won their last two games; they now 
stand at 17-16 for the season.

Following a trend that’s held 
through the entire season, UCSD’s 
defense was the main reason for the 
Tritons’ success in the game. Senior 
goalkeeper Kim Hockett anchored-
her team with five saves, giving her 
a program-record 277 saves for the 
season. 

“Our team’s defense is always 
strong,” sophomore utility Stephanie 
Bocian said. “We just need to focus 
on taking the right shots and put-
ting them away.”

Senior utility Nicole Hermann 
helped out with the offense, put-
ting the Tritons on the board early 
with a 6-on-5 goal to give UCSD 
a 1-0 lead. UCSD added another 
score from Bocian, netting a near-
side goal with 3:41 left in the first 
period.

UCSD entered the second peri-
od with a 2-0 lead and looked to 
add on before halftime. With the 
Tritons playing five of their seniors 
on offense, the only junior in the 

pool for UCSD, attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer, netted a goal in the 
Tritons’ half-court offense to extend 
the advantage to three goals. UCSD’s 
defense, led by Hockett, continued 
to hold the Lancers scoreless in the 
contest and Gstettenbauer added 
another goal on the Tritons’ coun-
terattack to make the score 4-0. 

The Tritons wasted no time add-
ing onto their lead, coming out of 
halftime with Hermann converting 
on her second goal of the game 

on UCSD’s first possession of the 
half. On the ensuing possession, 
the Lancers finally got rid of their 
goose egg and cut the Tritons’ lead 
to 5-1. 

With the Tritons holding onto a 
comfortable lead and the game in 
the fourth quarter, the Tritons took 
Hockett out, only to see sopho-
more goalkeeper Markayla Quane 
continue the success in the goal. 
With 4:46 left in the final period, 
Gstettenbauer used a pass from 

senior two-meter Judy Emaus to 
score her second goal of the night 
and give the Tritons a 6-1 lead. 

Cal Baptist’s offense found its 
rhythm late in the period, scoring 
three goals on the Tritons’ defense. 
Still, UCSD’s strong start was 
enough to secure the win and give 
the Tritons momentum heading 
into the WWPA Championship.

“We played well in the game,” 

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN
The men’s tennis team took care of No. 34 
Sonoma State University 6-3 on April 17 but D-I 
Davis eeks out 5-4 win to avoid upset on April 18.

Triton athletes set 
all-time school 
records and reach 
national qualifying 
marks in busy week.

Emily McGregor
Track & Field

The senior finished fifth in the 10,000-meter race 
at the Mt. SAC relays on April 18 to qualify for 

the NCAA D-II National Championship and set 
a new UCSD record with a time of  35:26.

Riding a two-game 
win streak, the Tritons 
head into the WWPA 
Tournament  to take on 
UC Davis and Loyola 
Marymount University.

SERVICES
A criminal record may interfere 
with obtaining employment and 
even a license to work in your cho-
sen profession. My law practice 
prepares students with a criminal 
history to obtain a professional 
license and enter the job force with 
their best foot forward. We help 
students demonstrate their reha-
bilitation by offering many services 
at very affordable rates. We offer a 
free consultation to any student 
upon request in a strictly confiden-
tial setting. We aggressively pur-
sue clearing criminal records in an 
efficient and timely manner. Email 
or call for a free consultation, (619)
