A.S. Council President Pro Tempore 
Resigns, Citing Personal Reasons 
DEPARTURE: Joy de La 
Cruz assumes Alexandra 
Webber's position 
By Nandlnl Harlhareswara 
Guardian Reporter 

Eleanor Roosevelt College Junior Sena-
tor Alexandra Webber resigned from the 
A.S. Council last night, citing personal rea-
sons. Webber has also withdrawn from UCSD 
for the quarter. 

Elected last Spring, Webber spent her 
time on the counci l addre~si ng issue rang-
ing from campus safety and sex ual harass-
ment to the university budget , and was very 
active in her college. 

Webber also worked with the A.S. external 
affair office on statewide issues, and received 
praise from her colleagues for dependability. 

"Her passion for serving students and 
followi ng through on her responsi bi lities wi II 
be missed the most," A.S. President Coleen 
Sabatini said. 

Webber recently became president pro 
n:mpore, replacing Alex Sano, who him 'elf 
replaced Greg Field as the administrative 
vice president. 

"I'm really di sappointed that I can' t con-
tinue," Webber aid from Los Angeles. "For 
outstanding pers(lnal rea ons I can not con-
tinue as a student or a member of A.S." 

Marshall Freshman Senator Joy de La Cruz 
will replace Webber as president pro tempore.

PPS Drops New 
Plastic Recycling 
Program 
MONEY: Pilot recycling effort at 
Muir College cancelled for lack of 
funds, organizers plan to try again 
., Alex Gorman 
Staff Writer 

A pioneer program for recycling plastic on cam-
pus, scheduled to begin thi s quarter, has been post-
poned due to a lack of available funds . The program 
would have affected only Muir college, but if suc-
cessful it was to be implemented in other parts of 
campus. 

"It 's just not happening right now," Physi al Plant 
Services (PPS) Waste Prevention and Recycling Co-
ordinator Kri sta Henkels said. Henkels has been work-
ing toward expanding recycli ng services to include 
plastics. 

Several years ago, the recycli ng co-op attempted to 
enact a si milar program - with di sasttous results. 
Only narrow-necked bOllles marked with ei ther a " I" 
or "2" symbol on the bOllom are recyclable. Due to 
lack of public knowledge, the recycl ing co-op was 
flooded with plastics of all kinds. The expense of 
separating all the different kinds proved to be too 
much. 

To avoid the same problem, Henkels said she 
hopes to educate people about the different types of 
plastic when the project finally gets under way. 

However, the recycling market has recently been 
in decline. While campus recycling normally pro-
duces money, times have been tough. In the light of 
these costs, Henkels said PPS simply cannot afford to 
add plastic at this time. 

"Until we get a better financial picture, it 's on 
hold." she said. 

UCSDcurrently ha facilitie to process recyclable 
cardboard by packaging it in bales. The bales, which 
weigh approximately 1,000 pounds each, fetch a higher 
rate than loose pieces would. 

However, there are currently no facilities avail-
able to bale the large amount of recycled paper PPS 
dea ls with , forcing them to ell the paper at a lower 
price. 

The recycling program does manage to make a 
profit on white paper, but mixed-paper recycling takes 
a loss. Henkels said that while the program almo t 
pays for itself, a good portion of its budget goes to 
covering the mixed-paper 10 and other maintenance 
costs. 

PPS is now analyzing the cost-effectiveness of 
building facilities to bale paper. Such a move would 
boost the profitability of campus recycling efforts.

BUDGET: Fee 
increase is part of 
governor's 'compact' 
Continued from page 1 

In October 1996. the UC Board 
o f Regents approved its propo ed 
1997- 1998 UC budge!. The regent 
voted to raise fees for resident stu-
dents by eight percent and non-resi-
dent students by seven percent. The 

ing fees by 10 percent every year for 
the next four years. 

According to Student Regent Jess 
Bravin, adhering to the terms of the 
compact has forced the university 
into a position of asking for less 
money than it needs. 

"What I find very disturbing 
about the whole budget process is 
that the fee increase was proposed at 
the governor' s behest," Bravin aid. 
"The governor persuaded the uni -

regents al a i nsti -
tuted a new $40 
tec hnology fee 
for all students. 

Theuniversi ty 
included the fee 
increa es in its 
budget proposal 
as part of an 
agreement au-

proposed at the 

versity 10 seek a 
fee increase and 
crea te the vo-
ca bulary word

Bravin sa id he 
was troubled by 
the way the bud-
get process has 
unfolded in the gov.rnor's 

beh.st." 
last few year as 
the uni versi ty has 

-Jess Bravln 
UC Student Regent 

taken the pressure 
off politicians by 
a k ing for insuf-

with Higher Education. 
In the compact , the governor 

agreed to increase the university ' s 
general budget by an average of 
four percent over the next four years, 
consistent with the univer ity rais-

ficicnt resources. 
Bravin added that if the ' tate 

doe not "buyout" the fee increase, 
it appears that the regents were re-
sponsible for ra ising fees. If the tate 
has a surplu of money, as it has in 

The UCSD Guardian 

the last few years, Bravin said the 
governor and legislature can buy 
out the fee increase and "take credit 
for il. " 

"I really dislike the whole situa-
tion. where we are asked to do the 
dirty work for the politician ," he 
said. "The compact is about the uni -
versity surrendering before the bud-
get bailie evelTbegan." 

Wil son spok esper on Li sa 
Kalusti an confirmed the "buyout" 
o f the eight-percent student-fee in -
crease for resident students, but said 
no funding was provided to buy out 
the fee increase for non-resident or 
professional students. 

Facu Ity and staff serve to benefit 
greatly from the proposed budge\. 
Recognizing that UC faculty and 
starf salaries have not kept up wi th 
those at comparable institutions, the 
regents requested funds to phase in 
two years of salary increases. 

Kalusti an confirmed full fund-
ing of the uni versi ty 's request for 
approximately $ 1 00 million for fac-
ulty and staff sa lary increases. Of 
that amount, $30.7 mill ion wi ll be

pus. encompassing well more than 500 students . By our 
count, the department made at least three major time 
changes to courses offered this quarter. The rub is that 
these changes have produced several irreconcilable con-
flicts . ECON 163, I72S and 173 are now all offered 
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at nine. Similarly, 

ON 132 and 101 both now meet Mondays and 
Wednesdays at one. Conflicts like these are what make 
timely graduation, to put it mildly, a challenge. 

Schedule changes are, however, by no means limited 
to the economics department. The electrical and comput-
er engi neering department has also made changes that 
have resulted in simi lar problems. ECE 146 and 165 are 
now in conflict, as are 108, I72A and 183. 

Hopefully schedule changes are being made for com-
pelling reasons, not just because Professor XY likes to 
eat lunch at noon rather than at one. We hope that in the 
future faculty and department coordinators consider the 
deleterious impact that haphazard scheduling can have 
on students. 

Studeilt-.t:ee Buy-out Reeks 
of Political Ma1euveIiltg 

tudents across the state will no doubt breathe a sigh 
of relief over Gov. Pete Wilson's 1997-98 state budget. 
which includes a buy-out of proposed fee increases for 
residents attending the UC and CSU systems. The UC 
Regents had approved a budget in October that would 
have raised student fees by 8 percent for residents and 7 
percent for non-residents , earmarking the revenue to 
finance $100 million in staff and faculty cost-of-living 
adjustments and merit salary increases. 

There is some question as to whether the buy-out is 
just a public-relations ploy by the governor or a genuine 
effort to improve state-sponsored higher education. All 
indications are that the UC regents were merely follow-
ing.Jhe.conditions of a 1995 verbal agreement with the 
governor, the Governor's Four Year Compact with 
Higher Education, which called on the university to raise 
student fees by 10 percent annually for the next four 
years in exchange for a promised 4 percent yearly 
increase in funds allocated to the university. 

As a result of this agreement, the governor is present-
ed with a fine opportunity to demonstrate his magnanim-
ity each year by buying out the annual fee increase that 
he forced on the regents . If, when the next recession hits, 
the governor chooses not to buyout the fee increase, he 
will have the perfect scapegoat - the UC Board of 
Regents - which is forced to include the fee increase in 
the UC's budget. All in all it 's a very well-crafted politi -
cal strategy that forces the regents to make the unpopular 
choice each year of either raising fees or cutting spend-
ing, while presenting Wilson with a chance to make him-
self out to be the farsighted governor who generously 
maintained affordability in higher education. 

The Guardian editorial board. while thankful for 
anorher year without fee increases, cannot help but feel 
a bit disgusted by Wilson's political maneuverings.

PROP. 209 INJUNCTION IS 
CONSTITUTIONAL NONSENSE 

COMMENTARY: Unwilling to a~cept political defeat, proponents of 
affirmative action enlist a liberal judge in their ideological crusade 

If anything can be said for 
modern-day liberals it is that 
they have an insatiable tendency 
to turn policy disagreements into 
life-or-death constitutiona l 
struggles. The liberal credo 
seem to be, " If public opinion is 

J against you, 
Nat e argue the 
PIETILA Constitution --=~;".";;,,,-=-==-~ (especially in 

Res idel1 !

the case of 
i sues like 
abortion). If 

ring special benefits on some groups, but not others. 
According to Mr. Johnson. it is unconstitutional to 
allow preferential treatment to be given to some peo-
ple (children of veterans. for example) and not to 
other people (minorities and women who benefit 
from programs such as affi rmative action). 

If followed to its logical conclusion, this argu-
ment would have the effect of 
turning judges into legislators. It 
is a question of legislation - not 
of constitutional law - whether 
the chi Idren of veterans should be 
given preferential treatment in the 
admission ' process. 

the Con litution is again t you, 
argue public opinion (especially 
when you're trying to nationalize 
health care). And if public opinion 
and the Constitution are against 
you, denounce your political 
opponents as immoral and mean-
spiriled (especially when trying to 
overturn initiatives like 
Proposition 209}." 

Thus, we shouldn't be sur-
prised when liberals scurry off to 
file a lawsuit in federal court after 
they've been beaten at the polls. 
Indeed, this is exactly what hap-
pened a fter the recent passage of 
Proposition 209. Much to the dis -
may of Pete Wilson and Ward 

The main problem 
with Judge 
Henderson's 
reasoning Is that It 
leads to a 
repudiation of the 
Initiative proce .. 
Itself. 

Only the people, through their 
representatives in the legislature, 
have the right to judge the moral -
ity of rewarding military service 
at the cost of not admitting mar-
ginally qualified applicants. The 
courts do not have any special 
expertise or wisdom. nor do they 
have any right or competence, in 
determining such questions of 
policy. 

In reality, Mr. Johnson missed 
the whole point of the reasoning 
behind Judge Henderson's injunc-
tion. Henderson based his reason-
ing on the Equal Protection 
Clause of the 14th Amendment, 

Connerly. IWO of 209's most ardent supporters, U.S. 
District Judge Thellon Henderson imposed an 
injunction again t the implementation of 209 on con-
stitutional grounds. 

everal arguments against the constitutionality of 
209 were offered in this space by Brent Johnson last 
Dec. S. The first, and most novel , was the idea that 
the Constitution prevents Ihe majority from usi ng its 
"numerical muscle" to overwhelm a minority. In 
other words, the Constitution itself is unequivocally 
opposed to demOl:racy, for the very definition of 
democracy is that the candidate or policy that gets 
the most votes wins. This , needlcs to say, is a very 
awkward position for a liberal 10 hold. 

Another argument offered by Mr. Johnson was the 
flotion that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th 
Amendment prevents the government from confer-

which prohibits a state from deny-
ing "any person within its jurisdiction the equal pro-
tection of the laws." 

The purpose of the 14th Amendment was to 
ensure civil justice for newly emancipated laves in 
the post-Civil War South. The amendment was 
designed to keep states from violating the civil rights 
of former slaves within their borders. A state could 
not, for example, intentionally refrain from prosecut-
ing the murderer of an emancipated slave. Neither 
could a state deny a former slave access to the civil -
justice system. The amendment, along with the 15th 
Amendment. was also designed to protect the ability 
of former slaves to participate in the political 
process. 

Thi ' guarantee of political participation was-the 
basi for Judge Henderson's deci ion to halt the

COMMENTARY: Once computer illiterates face their problems, they can overcome their ignorance and fear by 
reading self-help computer books, enrolling in educational classes and bribing their favorite computer genius 

CONQUERING COMPUTER ILLITERACY HEAD-ON 
By 110 ... F ••• 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Afler success fully evadi ng the 
necessity of becoming computer 
compelent for the past 20 year , I 
have finally come to the conclu-
sion that it 's no use trying to hide. 

The first of what was to be a 
multitude of intimidating situa-
tion happened about two years 
ago on a trip to the library. 
Expecting to find a solid, old-
fashioned card-catalog cabinet. I 
found in its place a wretched com-
puter l I am embarrassed to say 
that I haven ' t made an appearance 
since. 

So I began a list of places I 
would have to avoid. High on this 
list were the many UCSD comput-
er Jab, which I have evaded with 
as much ski ll as Michael Jackson 
has the masculinity fairy. How 
cou ld I deal with my ignorance of 
computers when such a plenitude 
of neon blips mocked my very 
existence? 

The point at which I seriously 
considered becoming a recluse 
was when the microchip prodigies 
invaded my only sanctuary in life 
- coffee houses. The appearance 
of a computer in the middle of 

Espresso Roma is truly a shame. 
Most of the allure of gelling cof-
fee in the first place is being able 
to slart conversations with the 
persoll next to you , or play cards, 
backgammon or ches~ . The 
emphasis should be group inlerac-
tion , not individual isolation. The 
person with his back turned to you 
in an Internet-induced coma docs 
not a friendly face make. Caffeine 
wi II never be the same. 

Being a writer, I couldn ' t 
ignore the situation any longer. 
Rather than running the opposite 
direction, I decided to attack my 
ignorance head-on. I broke down 
and bought a personal computer. 
My mom sent me a book called 
" Word For Windows 95 For 
Dummies." I began saving the 
computer section from the daily 
newspaper. and I made feeble 
allempts to pick up and even read 
computer magazines. Somehow, 
just having the literature made me 
feel more secure. 

Perhaps. my dear reader. you 
think I am overreacting . But 
remember this: Working with 
modern innovations makes things 
easier only if you have been fol -
lowing computer technology for

the past 10 years. For the rest of 
us, however. it is virtually impos-
sible to pick a ptace to jump into 
the fray_ Indeed . it is as over-

whelming and pleasurable a

be a part of the madness. 

So I made the ominous journey 
down the dank stairwell leading 
toward Ihc dungeon. Filting 'ur-
roundings, I Ihought. for pcople 
who devote their lives to the 
netherworld of technology. The 
AP&M hallway loomed ahead, 
each echoing footstep bringing 
me closer to the enemy. All I 
knew wa Ihat I had to find a per-
son dressed in a black and white 
referee shirt - a "Lehra." Just 
knowing this bit of computer 
slang boosted my confidence. 

Why a referee shirt? I had 
visions of angry students fighling 
for the lasl available compuler. 
However, it was strangely quiet 
for such a violent place, the 
whirring of computers providing 
the only soundtrack for my pri -
vate melodrama. I finally found a 

Lebra and asked for help. 
"Log on. " she commanued. 

What docs that mean'! What do I 
do? The terror! The panic! 
Tremhling. I typed in my pass-
word. My account popped up. I 
had triumphed in my first bailie! 
Electronic elation surged Ihrough

my newfound joy_ 

I had cut my vein open, and 
now I would let it hleed. I had 
visions of taking all the computer 
courses ever offered. majoring in 
computer science and conquering 
my fears forever. But alas. this 
vision was abruptly thrown into 
realistit; relief when I realized that 
an introductory computer course 
is only offered during the fall 
quarter. 

This is an outrage! How can a 
school so technologically 
advanced dismiss the need to offer 
an introductory computer course 
every quarter? I cannot be the 
only computer illiterale on cam-
pus. In fact. after dis~ussing the 
matter with several peers, I am 
convinced that there are hoards of 
people like me, too embarrassed 
to admit 10 their own ignorance.

thing, come to think of it.) 

Obviously, Judge Henderson's 
reading of the equal protecti on 
clause is unsound . Most law is 
designed to tip the political bal-
ance of power - to secure, in 
Henderson's words , "a reversal of 
fortunes ." Thi s, however, is no 
reason to declare such law uncon-
stitUlional. 

Judge Henderson's injunction 
agai nst Proposition 209 is nothing 
more than a cynical, liberal 
att empt to fru~ trate the will of the

According to Richard Attiyeh, interim se-

community involvement, including a commu-
nity service award from the San Diego County 
Bar Association. Parode was also presented 
wi th the Salvation Army Auxiliary 's "Woman 
of Dedication" award. ... 

Parode said her work at UCSD will be a 
"whole new chapter" in which her role is not 
yet solidifi ed.

Choreographer and lounge singer 
Toledo hits the stage in San Diego 
with "Fishnets and Cigarettes" 

aybe it was when hi s 
half-naked girls start-
ed to dance. 

Maybe it was 
when hi saxophoni st 

crammed two instrumen ts into hi ~ 
mouth at the same time , belting chords 
over the polyester-clad crowd. 

Or maybe it was when he personally 
took over the mood of the place - and 
everyone knew that their cheap smokes 
and fake Sinatra outfits wouldn 't cut it 
in hi s world. Maybe only then 
did Toledo create a space of hi s 
own in the cluttered lounge act 
landscape. 

In any case, the Hanalei 
Hotel in Mi ss ion Valley wasn't 
quite the same after Toledo's 
jazz and improv show slinked 
into an Di ego la t weekend. 

Toledo's live show - one part jazz, 
one part blues, two parts spoken word 
- was tabbed "Fi shnet & Cigarettes," 
al so the name of his first album. And 
the show didn't end for most untiltherc 
had been a few cigars burned, a few 
martinis chugged and a few sy ll a bl e~ 
purred. 

Toledo, who . old out numerous per-
formance~ in Los Angeles and San 
Francis 0, is quickly developing a fol -
lowing in younger circles. Saturday 
night was a case in point: The San 
Diego crowd wa young and clea rl y 
prepared for the occasion, crowned 
with colorful fezes and sporting white 
collars sticking out from under dark 
jackets. 

Toledo's shows are all about ambi-
ence, so hi first song - "Death Took a 
Holiday" - set the tone for what would 
be a murky, bluesy performance the rest 
of the way. He took to the stage amid a 
cloud of cigarette smoke, red shoes 
sticki ng out from under his trim gray 

suit. A small Stetson hat rna ked his 
face . 

Toledo packed deep and raw emo-
tion inlo his early songs. His grizzly 
voice - like Tom Waits' - penetrated 
the confines of hotel lounge, causing a 
good dea l of ambiguity and feedback, 

"Every song on the album is a true 
story," Toledo said. "The only reason I 
am who I am is because of who I was .. . 
Every curse is a bless ing in di sgui se." 

A former heroin user gone st raight, 
Toledo credits some of hi s mo t 
"horrifying momenls" as the 
motivation for hi s current suc-
cess. 

He used to be a music video 
choreographer, working with 
such stars as Janet Jackson, 
Paula Abdul and George 
Michael. Now, he works for 

himself. 
Emulating '405 performance sty le, 

Toledo held a brassy, old-school micro-
phone throughout hi s first set. But 
unlike blues performers of yesteryear, 
Toledo got up and danced. He frequent-
ly twirled up and down the stage steps 
and into the first row of tables. 

"It 's a montage of live life," Toledo 
exp lai ned . "A lot of the album and SO 
percent of the show is improvised ." 

Toledo did appear to be making up 
the moves as he went along, which 
made for an exciting act. A few weeks 
before, Toledo entertained small , but 
enthusiastic: crowds at Taxxi in down-
town La Jolla. Last Saturday, he had 
more room to roam with a larger tage 
and a larger crowd. 

Toledo's next few songs, especially 
the jazzy "Saxface" and "Fishnets & 
Cigarette ' ,n went over well , as the sax-

ophoni~t belted out chords and the lead 
guitarist rattled off cool. but not-too-

British rap art ist and producer 
Tricky's spacey version of trip-hop 
seems influenced by musical gen-
res as varied as ambient , Jamaican 
dub, blues guitar, jungle drumming 
and gangsta rap. Bul , if anything, 
Tricky's latest effort , Pre-Millenj·

showing off a freer, bo lder and 
more hard-hitting side of the arti st 
than his preceding releases.

** 

Engine !Ul's ~ec()nd fu ll length 
album, SI/owman. \ounds like an 
allempl at miXing pop with heavy, 
moody riff~ . Its calchy pop melodies 
throw the band into the abyss of the 
bubble-gum pop-pu nk bands that 
began appearing on the scene five or 
six years ago. The new album will 
probably find it crossover appeal 
within the "a lternative radio" mar-
ket. 

The name Engine 88 wi ll sound 
familiar to anyone who saw them 
tour with Jawbox, Jawbreaker or 
The Buzzcocks in the last eighteen 
months. With songs like "The Snow-
man" and '1'he Killer Willow," thi s 
record might solve the collecti ve 
action problem of punk rock: social 
degenerates and jocks have the same 
thing in common at last. 

The new album's fi rst song, enti-
tled "Ballerina," is the most dynam-
ic song on Ihe record but fail s to 
stand out as a good song. The fifth 

ong, a dark, melodic love song 
enl illed "Islanbul," slows Ihe record 
down a bi!. With Ihe exception of ils 
slower song, nowmall sound 
fo rmulaled ill> mo t punk record~ 
these days. 

If you are lookmg 10 hear some-

GHOSTS OF 
MISSISSIPPI 

Film documents ongoing 
civil rights trial 

By Lindsay HarrIs 
ASSOCiate Hiatus Editor 

The civil rights movement of 
the la te '60s and '70s is often char-
acterized by powerful politicallig-

ure~ such a Marlin 
Luther King, Jr. and Mal-
COhll X. Burning LTmsc.". 
police hrutalrty and llIa~­
,ive riOl ~ and prote~t~ 
quickly bee'llne signs of 
the time. 1\ collage of 
thcse i Illage~, sy mhol~ 
and icons was Ilashed 
across the ,creen in the 
opening sequence of "Gho~ts or 
Mississippi ." 

However, a smaller-scaled 
version of these phenomena as 
given new life and recognit ion in 
the film "Ghosts of Mississippi." 
which stars Alec Baldwin and 
Whoopi Goldberg. 

"Ghosts of Mississippi" docu-
ments the life and untimely death 
of civil -rights leader Medger 
Evers. Evers spoke out against 
racism and attempted 10 gain equal 
legal ri ghts for the black citizens of 
Missis ippi as well as those across 
the nation. 

His brand of radicalism was 
intolerable in lhe deep South dur-
ing that era, resulting in Evers' 
assassi nation by an upper-class 
white man ni cknamed "Delay" 
(James Woods). Woods' perfor-

mance in the movie embodies the 
injustice and reinfo rces the stereo-
types wbich plagued the South . 

Instead or bringing "Delay" to 
justice in court for hi, crimc, the 

Evers trial was made 
into a mockery and 
was declared a mistrial 
on two separate occa-
sions. 

Twenty-five YCM, 
ras, and the Ever., ca'C 
surpri~il1g ly resur-
faces. Evers' widow 
(Whoopi Goldberg) 

pursues the case and conlacts the 
Assistant District Attorney (Alec 
Baldwin) to assist her in the bailie. 

Because "Ghosts of Mississip-
pi" is based on a true story, the 
film 's directi on is obvious. Ulti-
mately, justice was served to 
"Delay," who was seventy years 
old by this lime, when he was 
senlenced to jai I for the murder of 
Medger Evers. A mixed jury of 
black and white Americans put 
"Delay" behind bars. 

"Ghosts of Mississippi" effec-
tively represents the hardships 
and ignorance that took place dur-
ing the civil ri ghts era, giving 
credit and recognition to those 
who led the movement. Many 
parts of the film move slowly, 
hea ting the message into Ihe 
ground.

HI4 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian " Thursday, January 9, 1997 

Courtesy of Moonshine Publicity 

'1AoI Cat" Toledo comes to San Diego on wave of lounge phenomenon . 

TOLEDO: 
L.A. lounge singer 
recalls older era 
Continued from page 11 
catchy riffs. 

At one point, the sax player 
played his instrument and an E-flal 
clarinet al the same time, his hands 
moving separately. The drummer, 
wearing a goofy French beret, was 
also competent. 

Still, perhaps the best part of the 
show was Toledo's dancers. With 
slinky black dresses, fish net hose 
and lots of sexuality, they captivat-
ed more than one male spectator. 
They didn 't dance to every song, 
but slouched off in comer chairs, 
giving people ~e eye and fading 
into the background. 

When they got up again, the 

dancers broke down the fourth wall, 
interacting with the audience, blend-
ing into it and emerging once again 
on the slage. 

Despile all Ihe posilive cle-
ment , in Ihe end, it's hard to lell if 
Toledo's show was merely smoke, 
mirrors and flashy dancers or Ihe 
work of a legitimate jazz artisl on 
hi s way 10 the top. 

One can' l help but wonder if 
Toledo's current rise is the result of 
a recent fad in lounge music, marti -
nis and Frank Sinatra. 

But perhaps it doesn't malter. 
Toledo presented a highly enter-
laining package Saturday night (he 
will return for performances at 10 
p.m. and midnight at the Hanalei ). 
And, as he casually puts it: "Me, 
I'm a cat that came from nowhere 
and ended up somewhere cool." 

Somewhere very cool, indeed.

MOMMY: Let 
there be reform 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS IS 

ContJnued from p ... 20 
like everyone knew they wou ld -
that is, atrociously. Vancouver i 6-
27. Do we need an 82-game season 
to prolong their embarrassment? 

New classes start January 27... • 
. Slgnupn_1 t G£S, \.ooking Or 

The remaining 50 games basi· 
ca lly separate the less-mediocre -
teams from the more-mediocre 
teams for playoff purposes, which 
basically segues into my next rul-
ing ... 

Don ' t let so many teams into 
the playoffs. 

Thi is a no-brainer. Any team 
that can make the playoffs while 
barely winning half its games 
docsn't deserve it - period. Hockey 
is also gui lty of thi s infraction; let -
ting too many teams into Ihe play-
offs reduces the imporlanceof regu-
lar-season games and lengthens the 
po t eason, which is already an un-
bearable odys ey . 

Move back the 3·point arc, for -
pete's sake! 

Why they moved it closer in the 
first place is beyond me, but clearly 
we have to move the thing back 
again. Three-point shooting should 
be reserved for the true long-dis-
tance specia lists, like Charlotte 
s harpshooter Glen Rice and 
Chicago's downtown ace Steve 
Kerr. ow everybody - from re-
nowned defensive specia li st Dennis 
Rodman to Portland ' s lumbering 
center Arvydas '" have arthritis" 
Sabonis - is heaving the rock to-
ward the heavens on a regular basis. 
Enough is enough ! Put less empha-
sis on this brainless bombing and 
more on the 01' fundamentals of the 
game. 

Speed up the last two minutes. 
Have you ever enjoyed watching 

a see-saw basketball game, only to 
have it ruined by the final two min-
utes - which are chock-full of 
countless time-out calls and ince -
san I fouling? Of course you have , 
which is why I plan on implement-
ing a one- lime-out ru le that allows 
each team only one T.O. in the final 
two minutes. Add to that my three 
free-throw decree, which permits 
three foul shots for cach foul com-
mitted during these final minute of 
play (four shots on three-point at-
tempts), thus discouraging sense-
less fouling . Now you'll have excit-
ing finishes spawned from the un-
thi nkable - namely actual defense 
and fundamental offensive strate-
gies. Remember those? 

There you have it , Mom, my 
mani festo. I figure once I send it off 
to the NBA. I' m a ci nch to gellhe 
job. Say "hi" to Dad for me. 

P.S. end money and more of 
those chocolate-covered cheese-
filled pretzels 1 like.

Speedo CUp is the Perfect Setting for QUalifying 
EFFICIENT: Recording one of the best meets in UCSD history, 22 of 25 Triton swimmers qualified,' for the NCAA Champion-
ship meets in March, as 16 of 17 women and six of eight men recorded times good enough for a chance to compete in Ohio 
By Adria McClain 
Staff Writer 

Hard work, dedication and tenac-
ity: TIlese are the secrets to the succes 
of the Tri ton swim squad. 

UCSD traveled to 
Long Beach Dec. 5-7, 
1996, for the Specdo 
Cup. which is one of 
two meets where the 
Tri ton swimmers will 
attempt to qualify for 
Ihe NCAA Champi-
on hipmcetinMarch. 

In attendance at the Speedo Cup 
were Division I schools such as 
Stanford. Berkeley and USC as well 
as DiVision II and III schools like 
Pomona-Pitler, Santa Clara and UC 
Santa Cruz. The Tritons sent a delega-
tion of 25 swimmers to the meet, and 
intheend,I60fthe 17womenandsix 
of the eight men qualified for the 
NCAA Championship meet. 

"11m is definitely the best we've 
ever done." Triton Head Coach Doug 
Boyd sa id. 

Freshman Matt Payne broke the 
UCSD men's record in both the 100 
and 200-yard breaststroke events. 

For the women, Li nda Monroe set 
a new Triton women's record in the 
400-yard Individual Medley and Sa-
rah Chu did likewise in the 100-yard 
breaststroke. 

In addition. severa l Triton swim-
mers finished their respective races 
With their beSI personal performances 
ever. Tim McAteer se t personal 
records in the 200-. 500- and 1650-
yard free tyle evenls. 

Scott Wiederhold shattered his 
previous individual records in the 200-
and 500-yard freestyles and Ihe 200-
yard backstroke. All-American Ed 
Ruth also had personal best swims in 
Ihe200-and400-yard Indi vidual Med-
leys. 

Incl uded in Ihe prestigiou~ group 
of all-time bests from the women werc 
Linda Monroe. Jen Poole. Rebecca 
Arnold , Kelly Byrne. Jenny Irwin, 
Sarah Chu, Ken Wilson. Allison 
Lcppke and Rebecca Rabe. 

we didn 't really rest all that much," 
Boyd said. 

The Triton swimmers trained con-
tinually from the end offinals through 
Dec. 23 and resumed on Dec. 30. The 
typical practice day includes an early 
morning workout, as well as an after-
noon workuut. 

"I was ex tremely pleased with the 
Speedo Cup," Boyd said. "I've never, 
everseen us swim Ihat well as a group 
at a CAA or anywhere. I can't un -
derscore h w well we did." 

The Tritons are permitted to take 
17 wimmers to the NCAA Champi-
onship meel and they already have 16 
who have qua li fied, Swimmcrs may 
4ualify for the championshi ps at the 
conference meet held in February or 
at anyone of the dual meets this 
season. 

The Triton plan to tak a full 
quad of 17 to the championshi p meel, 

the largest UCSD group to ever allend 
thi s meet. 

Four school record~ were broken 
as well as numerous personal records. 

"To break sehool records in Dc-
cember is prelty phenomenal because 

In Ihe meanlime, the Tri lons will 
swim on Sunday in Claremont against 
Trinity College and Pomona-Pitzer at 
noon. NCAA Hopes: Up-and-<:oming freshman Rebecca Arnold gasps for 

air as she qualifies in the lOO-yard breaststroke at the Speedo Cup.

am pro ba~k e lball' ., ~lIpremc 
emperor, changes that will turn 
the league arou nd and make It 
lun again. 

Number one, shorten the 
season. 

Let ' ~ face II . the sea~()n I ~ 
way too long - we ' re talking 
82 game~, nearly nine months 
including the pOMseason. 
Therefore, to reinstall some 
\ ignificance to the indIvidual 
game, I'm cutllng the season to 
a far more manage,lble 56 
games (a home and away 
contest again \ t eaeh team). 

Although hardly a third of 
the current 96-97 season has 
lapsed, the contenders have 
already been separated from 
the pretenders. Basketball isn' t 
like baseball , in whIch even the 
ga rbage DetroIt Tigers can Win 
40 percent of their ga mes. 
While dilTerences between 
c lubs in bascball can be subtle, 
determining the good teams in 
the NBA is as subtle as finding 
a Mack truck in a haystack. 
Why prolong the inevitahle? 

TCft ms like Chicago, 
Houston, Seattle, New York. 
Utah, Detroit and Los Angeles 
- squads that everybody knew 
were going to be good even 
before the season started - arc 
kicking booty. and their 
records reflect that. Heck. the 
Bulls arc 28-4 . Even my 
grandmother can pick who 's in 
and who's out. 

Meanwhile , crap teams like 
Boston , Toronto. Vancouver, 
Denver and Phoenix are playing

Game two aflowed UCSD to 
impress the home crowd with its 
scrambling defense. The Triton back

high 17 digs. came up with a num-

the match came

"We figured out some of the 
things we need to work on, "

a win against a team that we ' re up-

strong effort from the frontcourt

With a new coach and a revamped

turned over a new leaf and are well 
on their way to becoming a rnuch-
improved volleyball team.
