UCSD constructs 
bODlb blast simulator 

Project would measure 
blast effects on buildings 

By MEACiHAN FIELD 
Staff Writer 

UCSD announced on Dec. 
13 the beginning of construc-
tion on the world's first bomb 
blast simulator. T he simulator 
will be built at the Field Station 
at Camp E lliot, and will be used 
by structural engi neers at the 
Jacobs School of Engineering to 
test the effects of bomb blasts on 
structures. 

T he blast imuJator is con-
structed through a contract 
from the Technical Support 
Working Group, which is a fed-
era l interagency entity orga-
nized to fight terrorism. The 
results from the simulator will 
be u ed to devise methods to 

protect high-risk buildings in 
the event of terrorist bombings. 

"No two blast loads are the 
same. In order to do detailed 
development, we need to do 
fully repeatable tests which can 
only be done in a lab," UCSD 
Jacobs School of Engineering 
dean Frieder Seible said. "The 
whole goal for us is to move 
from field testing on buildings 
to field testing on components 
to quasi start testing in the labo-
ratory to real -time blast testing 
under laboratory conditions. 
And this is what we're doing at 
Camp Elliot." 

The project will cost $4.2 
million and is expected to be

At the center, she led groups of researchers author. 
to examine the relationship between brain • 
function and leaming language. With her team 
of collaborators, Bates conducted studies in 
over 20 languages on four continents. 

Bates authored or co-authored 10 books and 
over 2QO artides. Among her contributions to the 
cognitive science field was her research dernon-
strating the flexibility or "plasticity" of the brain. 
She snowed that children with injury to the Ian·

linguistic knowledge is distributed throughout the 
brain, rather than in one area, for language devel·

Her most recent discovery came in April 
2003, when Bates and her team announced 
they had developed a brain imaging technique. 
This technique uses maps that light up to pin· 
point the relationship between the severity of a 
behavioral deficit and the voxels in the brain 
that contribute to that deficit The technique, . 
called Voxel·based Lesion·Symptom Mapping, 
provides researchers with a way to pinpoint the 
specific areas of the brain most crucial for nor-

Student Services plans web portal 
MyUCSD would replace StudentLink 
By SHANNON EUOT 

Staff Writer 
The Student Services Portal 

Initiative, a plan aiming to 
improve the UCSD online stu-
dent network, was presented to 
the A.S. Council on Dec. 3 by 
Student Services and Business 
Affairs representatives. The pro-
posal seeks to enhance student 
convenience by implementing 
MyUCSD, a Weh portal that 
would blend important services 
and information from both 
Student Affairs and Business 
Affairs, as well as add new online 
features not available on 
StudentLink. 

Related services and informa-
tion will be aggregated into clear-
ly defined sections, such as sepa-
ra te academic, finances, career, 
student life and well ness and stu-
dent records pages. The proposal 
aims that students will be able to 
easily access important informa-
tion without being confused by a 
chain of links. In addition, the 
quantity of this information will 
be expanded under this plan to 
enable students find answers to 
their questions online, avoid lines 
and long visitS with administra-
tors. 

Darlene Willis, executive 
administrative officer of new ini-
tiative and community relations, 
expects UCSD to "deliver a ponal 
that is student-friendly and stu-
dent-service oriented." 

UCSD currently maintains 
two Web sites specifically tai-
lored to -its population : 
StudentLink for student use, and 
Blink for faculty, staff and admin-
istration use. The proposal 
emphasizes that while 
StudentLink provides relevant 
academic information, it lacks the 

news, campus messages, sched-
ul es and other information that 
Blink possesses. 

By forming a portal that 
merges the two sites, students 
would not only have access to 
their academic records and other 
information provided by 
StudentLink, but have the fea -
tures of Blink without having to 
switch back and forth between 
Web sites. 

Tn addition to creating a portal 
that blends StudentLink and 
Blink, Web technicians hope to 
build on the ideas of the former 
and offer the UCSD student com-
munity an improved site contain-
ing features that do not currently 
exist. Two new features are 24-
hour access to an improved infor-
mation source as well as the cre-
ation of online student service 
transactions. 

The new portal is expected to 
be online after two phases are 
completed. 

Phase one, primarily a plan-
ning period scheduled to be com-
pleted by winter 2005, will con-
sis t of gathering student input 
and forming an idea of how the 
new infrastructure will be built. 
Focus groups consisting of stu-
dents, faculty, and staff will be 
consulted to determine prefer-
ences and desires of the UCSD 
community. 

After meeting with student 
service staff, directors will devel-
op a look, content and service 
plan, which will give a rough idea 
of how the portal will appear to 
users, which information in par-
ticular will be made available to 
students, and how essential stu-
dent service transactions will be 
conducted over the internet. 

The second phase, consisting 

of t he actual construction and 
improvements of various elements 
of the first phase, has a goal of fall 
2006 for comp]etion. 

Designed to correlate with the 
opening of the Student Academic 
Services facility in 2006, the portal 
will "reduce the overwhelming 
nature" of such tasks, according to 
John McCleary, director of tech-
nology and development. 

Students would be able to ful-
fill all their administrative needs 
with one site - including pay-
ment of bills, ordering transcripts, 
answering major and general edu-
cation questions and making vari-
ous appointments. 

One feature of the portal, 
Willis says, is to make sure some-
one navigating through the sys-
tem doesn't need to know the 
organization of the infrastructure 
to find what they are looking for. 
For example, fo r students to 
access leadership opportunities 
online, they must know to look for 
Student Services; this portal , 
Willis believes, will eliminate the 
confusion that such scenarios pre-
sent. • 

Students expressed various 
reactions to the plans for the new 
portal. 

A.S. representative to 
StudentLink Vmcent Pascual sees 
the initiative as a good first step, 
but said he feels something is 
missing ftom the plan. 

"I felt it was geared toward 
staff with the addition of a few 
bells and whistles, wi th the first 
priority being to fulfill business 
transactions," he said. 

Pascual mentioned two issues 
of concern to him: the reforma-
tion of the online registration

The universi ty's current total 
state-funded operating budget is 
about $2.9 billion. 

Outreach programs, funding for 
which had been cut by 50 percent 
last year, could face elimination. 

"The governor has proposed 
spending CUts across the board, and 
the goal of those reductions was to 
save the core function of each pro-
gram," said Vince Sollitto, a 
spokesperson for the governor. "In 
higher education that is teaching 
Californians, so the proposals were 
done so that the cuts had the least 
impact on classroom teaching." 

In his Dec. 18 announcement, 
Schwarzenegger cited the 2003 
Budget Act as authorizing him to 
redirect up to 5 percent of funding 
for state agencies to other purpos-
es, giving him the right to imple-
ment the proposed mid-year cuts 
effective of that date. 

"It's a little bit of a gray area," 

would likely affect 
staff, not faculty. 

Just days before the governor's 
Dec. 18 announcement, UC student 
regent Matt Murray, along with the 
student trustees from the California 
State University and the community 
college systems, went to Sacramento 
on Dec. 15 to hand-deliver a letter 
addressed to Schwarzenegger. 

The letter called upon the gover-
nor to consider detrimental effects 
that cuts cou.ld have on California's 
higher education systems. 

"We fear that the combination of 
large srudent fee i nc~eases, massive 
reductions and possible elimination 
of UC and CSU outreach funding, 
and extreme restrictions on student 
enrollments in all three segments 
could dramatically transform our

Extraneous programs are excessive 
during times of fiscal crisis 

. 

By KAJ ROZGA 
Contributing Writer 

When looking at the 
economic problems that 
California faces, the 
answers to two questions 
reveal that Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's decision 
to cut $12 million in fund-
ing for UC outreach pro-
grams, with additional cuts 
for the next year, was the 
proper one: Are these pro-
gra ms effective, and are 
they essential enough to 
necessitate their mainte-
nance during a time in 
which the state faces the 
largest deficits in its 
history' 

In the end, the effective-
ness of the omreach pro-
grams proves only margin-
ally convincing, and there-
fore their necessity is lack-
ing on numerous accounts . 

Common descriptions 
of the UC outreach pro-
grams are similar to the 
mission statement for the 
Center for Research on 
Educational Equity, 
Assessment and Teaching 
Excellence: "[to) incrcase 
the number of underserved, 
low-income youths who are 
eligible for admittance to 
college" on campus. 
Definitely a noble effort in 
words, but what does it 
mean in operational terms? 

Unfortunately, the Web 
sites of C.R.E.A.T.E, and 
other programs like it, offer 
few answers. As one weaves 
through their elaborate 
web, each program 
entwined with several oth-
ers, a common theme 
evolves: ambiguity. 
Although programs like 
C.R.E.A.T.E. have heart-
felt mission statements, few 
can explain, in explicit 
terms, what "reaching out 
to underrepresented stu-
dents" actually means; even 
fewer can offer any con-
crete solutions. The mys-
tery surrounding the pro-
grams' methods casts a ' 
shadow of doubt on the 
urgency of their continued 
funding. 

In addition to this 
vagueness, there is a mis-
leading generalization 
about these programs: that 
they all serve to help 
underprivi legeu students 
ga in acceptance into UC 
school s. Thi s was the 
numerous programs' origi-
nal purpose and the [oun-
dation on whi ch public 

~upporr for them was 
based . 

In reality, many of the 
programs that are associat-
ed with outreach aim to 
educate K-12 teachers in 
such topics as mathematics, 

science, computers, space 
and astronomy. This fact 
brings up the question of 
the purpose these programs 
are meant to serve. 
Essentially, assocIatIOns 
like the Algebraic Thinking 
Institute are acting as an 
extension of teacher educa-
tion programs, bypassi ng 

PRO 
the original intent of UC 
outreach efforts. 

Due to the fact tha t 
many of these programs 
have little to do with help-
ing students gain admis-
sion to college, their 
necessi ty, especially in fis-
cally tight times, is debat-
able. 

Why is it essential to 
fund Astronomy for 
Educators to help it

Astro" to help 4th-
grade teachers

Outreach necessary to encourage 
qualified students to attend college 

.y ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

With all the talk of the 
economy getting back on its 
feet, it might seem a little 
strange that the state is still 
abuzz with phrases like "fis-
cal crisis." Budget cuts, as a 
girl from the Valley might 
put it, "are so 2003 ." But 
budget cuts are nonetheless 
on the way for the 
University of California, 
thanks to Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's declara-
tion of a financial crisis, 
which enables him to slash 
and trim at California's bud-
get un til the fiscal balance 
reaches some level of sanity. 
Having already suffered 
increases in student fees and 
more than $400 million in 
cuts (totaling 14 percent of 
the University of 
California's state-funded 
budget), the additional $40 
million or so of additional 
unallocated spending cuts 
over the next year may seem 
miniscule in comparison. 

The real eye-opener, 
however, is the complete 
elimination of state funding 
for K-12 outreach. Between 
the California State 
University and the 
University of California, 
these cuts total $84 million 

. over the year, but immedi-
ately, it means $12.2 million 
dollars have disappeared for 
UC outreach mid-year. 
Now, while that might seem 
like a lot of money, in the 
larger perspective, it really is 
small beans, when you con-

sider that repealing the 
car tax, 
Schwarzenegger's 
first move as 

governor, cost 
local counties 
$4 billion in 

revenue. 

But, an '<lstute observer of 
state politics might object; 
those local governments just 
got cut nice fat emergency 
checks from Sacramento. 
Look more closely, however, 
and one will find that those 
checks are written with the 
blood of the outreach pro-
grams and Cal Grants, both 
of which enable students 
from low income families to 
attend college. 

Now, while it's difficult 
to object to the strong cen-
tral leaders.hip that the new 
governor is providing, he is 
acting hypocritically. 
Schwarzenegger's only pre-
vious political experience 
was his touting of an after-
school initiative aimed at 
keeping underprivileged 
school children busy and off 
the streets. It seems rather 

(ON 
ironic that the group he rep-
resented in the past (and 
now it seems, exploited for 
his own political gain), is the 
very group that gets hi t the 
hardest with an impressively 
disproportionate budget 
cut; down to zero. 

Why is outreach impor-
tant? After all, we are 
sending these kids to a 
somewhat decent education 
funded by the state already, 
and as many of us at UCSD 
who came out of public 
schools might attest, the 
bathrooms may have been 
rather dirty, but the oppor-
tunity to take advanced 
classes was there for anyone 
so inclined. The problem is 
that in reality, since the 
entrenched upper-middle 
class of California refuses to 
fund educational oppommi-
ties for any kids except their 
own (as witnessed by the 
Proposition 13 tax revolt), 
educational opportunities in 
California vary widely 
depending on how affluent 
your neighborhood is. 

A few UCSD students 
rnight attest to how difficult 
a quality public education is 
to come by in some parts of 
California. Most UCSD 
srudents come from dispro-
portionately fortunate 
neighborhoods, and conse-
quently, better public 
schools . The outreach 
funds are there to serve as a 

small and valiant - but 
ultimately ineffective -
effort, to serve those popu-

lations for whom equal 
public educational 
opportunity is a myth. 

Why is it important 
to afford these kids as 
much opportunity to 
succeed and learn? 
Because it is a gross 

waste of talent 
otherwise - if 

regardless of race or eco-
nomic background, then we 
are actively losing intelli-
gence that could have been 
cultivated, and turned into 
bright engineers, doctors 
and poets. From an eco-
nomic efficiency standpoint, 
education for everyone 
turns out a few bright gems 
from which in turn everyone 
benefits. 

For those of us who are 
already at the University of 
California, outreach for 
future students may not 
seem like a particularly 
important thing, given that 
our student fees just wen t 
through the roof and the 
state is struggling to find the 
money to educate those of 
us who are already here. 
Why should we care? There 
are some people who will 
argue for the educational 
value of a diverse student 
body, but this writer tends 
to dismiss that as a rational -
ization for a loss of quality. 

The argument is a bit 
convoluted but it goes like 
this: As students at a public 
school, our education is 
being funded by the State of 
California. While we are not 
coercively obligated to 
repay the state in some man-
ner, we do have to realize 
that as the elite of 
California's public educa-
tional system, our eventual 
purpose is to serve the sra te. 
The state is best served 
when even the poorest are 
afforded equal educational 
opportunities because the 
most talented population 
ends up at a UC school, 
regardless of economic 
background. We should 
care, because as the state has 
paid for our education, we 
have a moral obligation to 
lobby for the best interests 
of the state. 

The unfortunate truth is 
that if our outreach pro-
grams worked betJ:er, if our 
public school system actually 
gave everyone the same qual-
ity of teaching and course-
work statewide, some stu-
dents currently at UC would 
not deserve to be here -
because students of greater 
talent, from lesser bac.k-
grounds might take their 
place. And those that were 
already here would be forced 
to work harder to earn the 
grades they currently get. 
Anyone who believes in cap-
italist economics will tell you 
that competition brings out 
the best in people. And what 
better way to compete than 
to allow all natural talent to 
get to UC? 

Isn't that a scary 
thought? That perhaps, if 
we actu'ally spent money on 
poor kids in the inner city 
and rural California, 
encouraging them to do bet-
ter in their classes so they 
could get to a UC school, 
they might displace some of 
us in admissions - not by 
vi reue of comprehensive 
review or anything like that,

either the Democrats or even more prevalent, the newly 

elected government in N~rthern 
Ireland, with Ian Paisley'S extrem-
ist Unionist party against Gerry 
Adam's socialist Sinn Fein, the 
political wing of the IRA. 

Thus, as many analysts suspect, 
if Howard Dean wins the pri-
maries, as is probable at this point, 
his negative rhetoric and blatant 
hate for all-things-Bush combined 
with his own Vermont brand of 
socialism will cost him an embar-
rassing defeat at the hands of a 
popular war-time president and a 
largely optimistic public. 

This, alone, would not cause 
the downfall of the party. Both 
Democrats and Republicans have 
lost embarrassing elections before. 
However, the Democratic Party is 
at a particularly precarious point 
in time. They are facing a presi-
dent who consistently has high 
approval ratings and who has a 
monopoly on the issue of national 
security, which is arguably the 
most important at this time. 

To add to this, the party is field-
ing nine different candidates who 
are tearing each other apart with 
negative campaigning, while Bush 
continues to look optimistic. Since 
the core constituents of the 
Democratic Party care about anger 
at this point, energy spent toward 
imagining a better America, rather 
than merely a Bush-less America is 
next to nothing. 

Even worse for the Democrats, 
the country is definitely in the 
middle of a pendulum swing to the 
right. At the 2000 election, regard-
less of the outcome, Americans 
identified themselves with the cat-
egory "conservative," two to one 
over the categoty "liberal." 

Bush is capturing the rest of 
the American moderate by com-
promising on issues like Medicare 
and backing down on illegal immi-
grant issues, while at the same 
time anacking affirmative action 
and anending church regularly, 
which pleases his base. 

The DLC, meanwhile, has near-
ly had enough. If Dean wins the 
nomination, via strong turnout by 
the party's left, and then goes on to 
lose the national election, it is very 
feasible that the moderate 
Democrats could fracture i nco a 
new party. Conversely, if Gephardt 
or Lieberman wins the nomination, 
the throngs of angry Democrats 
may very well fracture into a social-
ist party. nus would be particularly 
possible given the number of ener-
getic and idealistic young political 
enthusiasts that support Dean. 

All of this is not to say that the 
Republican Party may not frac -
ture. I r 'edict that if Bush loses 
the election, the Republican Party 
will be in more of a danger of 
splitting than the Democrats. 
Exhibit A is the California recall 
election. Social conservatives and 
fiscal conservatives, that is, 
McClintock and Schwarzenegger 
respectively, spent most of the 
recall biting each other rather than 
Davis. The national Republican 
party would have the same prob-
lem except that, through a variety 
of both conservative and moderate 
policies, President Bush has man-
aged to keep the Republican party 
together.

more talented kids exist in 
California than the ones who actu-
ally end up at a UC school? 

What is devastatingly cutting 
outreach actually about then? This 
is not about spending money where 
it is not needed. While the Los 
Angeles Times in an editorial 
claimed that outreach funds totaled 
to $29,000 for each underrepre-
sented minority student that 
enrolled at the University of 
California, this figure is grossly 
misleading, as it aggregates UC 
and CSU outreach funds into a cal-
culation only for UC students, and 
does not take into account the poor 
non-underrepresented minority 
students the funds served, nor does 
it take into account the students 
who ended up at a CSU school or 
went on to community colleges as a 
result of outreach. In spite of mas-
sive cuts to the UC and CSU hud-
gets, UC President Robert C. 
Dynes and CSU Chancellor 
Charles B. Reed chose this particu-
lar topic to focus on when they sent 
a letter to the governor arguing 
against spending cuts. 

The money spe~t on outreach is 
miniscule when you compare the 
vast inequalities in California's 
school systems to achievement as it 
stands. When one looks closer at 
repealing a car tax, then cutting 
outreach to malce up the gap, who 
benefits? Perhaps some of us who 
deserve a bit more competition for 
our grades than we currently get at 
UCSD. And who loses?

vices for Advanced Placement 
courses and other enrichment ser-
vices, which provide activities to 
inform students about higher edu-
cation. During the 200 1-02 school 
year, EAOP involved 84,187 stu-
dents corning from households 
with a mean income of'$5,000 less 
than nonparticipants. Advocates 
for outreach argue that elimina-
tion of such programs would be 
unfair to students that are from 
disadvantaged backgrounds. 

"We're pretty much facing an 
elimination of the program," said 
Director of FAOP at UCSD Rafael 
Hernandez. "It's devastating given 
the fact that the program gives aca-
demic support and advising to low-
income, first-generation students." 

According to Hernandez, 
many students do oot get the same 
opportunities as others that come 
from more affluent communities. 

"It's not a level playing field," 
Hernandez said . "All students 
should have access whether or not 
they come from low-income back-
grounds and they are the first in 
the family to attend college." 

Other experts on the topic 
maintain that outreach programs 
provide students with options for 
higher education and help to 
reduce disparities in the educa-
tional system. 

In a testimonial addressing the 
state senate budget subcommittee, 
Hugh Mehan, a UCSD sociology 
professor and director of the 
Center for Research on 
Educational Equity, Assessment 
and Teaching Excellence (also 
known as C.REA T.E.), stated that 
outreach programs "generate new 
research and policy recommenda-
tions for reducing disparities in 
California s educational system and 
raise the academic achievement of 
all California's students." 

While some have questioned 
the effectiveness of outreach, 
other studies have concluded that 
EAOP has benefited many stU-
dents. According to an analysis 
published in 2002 by Denise 
Quigley of the UCLA Center for 
the Study of Evaluation, students 
involved in EAOP had better aca-
demic records than those of a 
comparable group of students 
who were nonparticipants. 

According to Mehan, other 
outreach programs have made 
strides in improving educational 
opportunities. One such program, 
the Center for C.R.E.A. T.E., was

ble elimination of outreach pro-
grams. For Galya Diaz, a John 
Muir College senior who worked 
as an advisor for an EAOP-affiliat-
ed program, elimination of the pro-
gram could negatively affect many 
high school students. 

"I really don't think that out-
reach is the right place to take the 
cuts," Diaz said. "Cuts would mean 
not letting students find out about 
applications, fee waivers ... and it 
means cutting the future." 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior Leslie Trevino participated 
in EAOP during high school and is 
now a tutor and mentor for the 
program. As a high schuol student 
in the Imperial Valley, Trevino said 
that EAOP aided her application 
process and provided her with 
information about college. 

"These programs I was 
enrolled in facilitated the process I 
had to go through to get in to col-
lege," Trevino said. "The fact that 
they had representatives in the 
Valley made me feel worthy of 
attending a prestigious university.» 

According to some, EAOP is 
the only resource many students 
have in learning more about high-
er education. 

"I believe the rna jori ry of 
underrepresented students have 
been touched by outreach pro-
grams," Trevino said. "I've grown 
with my students and have 
watched them change their atti-
tudes toward school." . 

A hearing will be held in the 
assembly on Jan. 7 regarding the 
cuts. 

"If the proposal passes, we'll 
have to layoff personnel and staff 
and eliminate programs in 
schools," Hernandez said. "This 
would ultimately mean that the 
number of students that apply to 
UC, CSU and community col-
leges will drop.»

obtain during these tests, as each 
blast differs from the next. 

There have been field tests con-

Another technique is to wrap 
the columns in steel. This tech-
nique has also proved successful in 
stopping much of the damage so

the column and make it able to 
withstand the bending and swaying 
that occurs during and after a 
bombing. BO,th wrapping materials

under a blast is directly related to 
how the structure will react. While 
the blast load typically impaCts only 
a column, if the column is 
destroyed, the structure will not be 
able to stand. 

"For example, here in America, 
like in the Oldahorna City bomb-
ing, the blast loads typically affect 
our structures in a way that there is 
a regressive structural collapse fol-
lowing the initial blast loading," 
Seible said. "This collapse accounts 
for most of the casualties."

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

An overwhelming vote to ratify 
an agreement between the 
University of California and acade-
mic student employees on Dec. 6 
ended a cal l for strike of the univer-
sity's teaching assistants, readers and 
tutors, WIth a vote of 1,682 in favor 
and 26 opposed, the agreement will 
be effective until September 2006. 

The contract includes a 1.5 per-
cent minimum wage increase effec-
tive on Jan, I, and a 1.5 percent 
general wage increase for every 
time the senate faculty gets a merit 
increa e, Graduate student ASEs 
working a minimum 25 percent of 
the time will continue to obtain 
complete remission of their educa-
tion , registration and health fees, 

Ac~ording to a statement by 
Unite~ Auto Workers, the union 
representing approximately 11 ,000 
teaching assistants, readers and 
rutors at eight UC campuses, the 
remission will remain "despite the 
sharp increases in tudent fees and 
health care costs" for the year. 
Future increases in fees during the 
tern1 of the contract \vill be covered. 

According to the UAW state-

ment, the "rights and benefits of 
summer session ASEs will be great-
ly improved." The union will also 
be allowed to provide orientations 
to inform all ASEs about their ben-
efits and rights within the contract. 

Bargaining began in March, 
when the previous contract for 
ASEs expired. Throughout the 
process, UAW filed 64 unfair labor 
charges against the university for 
bargaining in bad faith . On Sept. 
30, talks broke down when the issue 
of sympathy strikes arose. UAW 
wanted to keep the right to strike in 
support of other unions striking on 
campuses, while the university 
wanted to take the language allow-
ing it out of any new contract. 

According to the newly ratified 
contract, while UAW "shall not call, 
promote or engage in a sympathy 
strike in support of another UC 
union or bargaining unit," individual 
ASEs have the right to engage in 
activities in sympathy with other 
unions striking at the ASEs work 
location, 

"We reached a satisfactory 
agreement over sympathy strikes," 
said Kathleen Casey, a teaching 
assistant from the communication 
department and a member of the 

bargaining team. " 
As part of the agreement, both 

sides also withdrew all bargaining-
rela ted unfair labor practice 
charges that were filed. 

"Our primary objective was an 
agreement tha t recognizes the 
important role our instructional 
assistants play in helping faculty 
meet UC's teaching needs, and also 
confirms the union 's obligation to 
labor peace," said UC spokesper-
son Paul Schwartz. "This agree-
ment does both." 

Following the Sept. 30 break-
down, the UAW called for a one day 
strike on Oct, 2. The union 
announced another strike for the last 
week of the winter quarter on Nov. 
25. Both sides agreed on a tentative 
agreement on Dec. 2, 

"The sympathy strike issue was 
significant because it underscores 
the murual obligation that labor 
and management share to settling 
differences through the negotiation 
process, and we're pleased to have 
resolved this issue to our satisfac-
tion," Schwartz said. 

Casey agreed, saying, "We're 
overall extremely pleased to have 
reached an agreement without hav-
ing to strike." 

Rosenfeld pointed out that 
even though he is the only trans-
fer student in the A.S. Senate, his 
constituency is limi ted to the 
seniors at his college, 

"I'm the only [transfer stu-
dent] on council and my job is not 
to represent transfer srudents at 
all," Rosenfeld said. "So that was 
just an example of why 
[Gallagher] feels that we need to 
look at our representation." 

The task force was created 
"in an effort to further promote 
the council's ability to better 
serve the students of UCSD," 
but it is not clear that the cur-
rent system of representation 
will be changed. 

gestions," Catcott said, ' 
The task force to examine 

representation structure was 
originally submitted by 
Gallagher at the council's Oct. I 
meeting. 

However, action on the task 
force was postponed due to con-
cern that other committees and 
task forces created by the council 
had not yet been filled. 

"In the end, Jeremy Gallagher 
said the people who want to do 
this are there ." and it needs to be 
done," Rosenfeld said. "He made 
a promise to us and said, 'Look, it 
will be done. If that's your main 
objection, don't worry about it.' 
And we said, 'OK, we'll take your 
word on this .... 

The task force charter incor-
porates a clause which will auto-
matically dissolve the task force if 
it is not filled by the third week of 
winter quarter 2004. 

Cuts: Students write letters to stop cuts 

"I think a very important 
point is that the creation of a task 
force doesn't necessarily indicate 
that there's any problem with the 
current system that we have," 
David Goodwin, chair of the 
Student Council at ERC, said, "1 
think it's good to look into and 
do evaluations of anything that 
you've got and not necessarily 
stop or hinder that by needing to 
say that any existing system isn't 
working. " 

Sierra Catcott, Thurgood 
Marshall College senior senator 
and senate chair, said that the 
council wanted to ensure that 
current representation structure 
wanted to was the best. 

Two commuter srudents, two 
transfer students, and two 0.0-
campus residents will be appoint-
ed by the A.S. president and 
approved by the council to serve 
on the task force . Each college 
council will also appoint a repre-
sentative. 

The task force's recommenda-
tions must be submitted to the 
council no later than week 10 of 
winter quarter. continued from page 3

BAC. 
Committee felt that it was 
important that both Price 
Center and Student Center be 
able to handle the projected 
increase in enrollments and the 
increased demand for services," 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Srudent Life and BAC co-chair 
Carmen Vazquez said. "Scheme 
II is larger than Scheme I and so 
is better sui ted to accornmoda te 
growth in campus enrollment 
and growth in srudent organiza-
tions, as well as larger events." 

alternative place to socialize 
besides Price Center." 

Simulator: Testing site will be 
built with $4.2 mil. federal grant 

The cost differential 
between the twO schemes is $2 
million. Scheme I involved 
mandatory measures, which 
included a variety of building 
code upgrades. It also includes 
repairs to the landscape areas 
and fa~de improvements to the 
current buildings, along with 
the addition of 2,300 gross 
square feet. This plan would 
cost about $5 million, while 
Scheme II would cost $7 mil-
lion in larger construction costs.

The development scheme 
incI udes the repair of various 
aspects of the current strucrures. 
These measures are meant to 
make the 25 year-old StnlCNres 
safer so that they meet with 
stricter current building codes. 
The measures include handicap 
upgrades, fixing rot and water 
damage in current strucrures 
and fire a1ann system updates. 

"Scheme II will replace 
wood structures that for over 
25 years have had electrical and 
mechanical issues with modern 
strucrures," Vasquez said.

for more tests . The blast simulator does 
not simulate the thermal energy which 
occurs during a blast, but only the pres-
sure created. According to Seible, this is 
because in most cases, thermal load is 
not important in terms of the structural 
response. 

"The goal of the program is to iden-
tify the response of strucrures during 
the blast loads," Seible said. 

The tests will be focused on com-
mon blast scenarios. These scenarios 
will be repeated multiple times in order 
to determine the ability of a structure to 
resist energy imposed by the blast. 
High-speed cameras will be used to cap-
rure the result. The ability to view each 
moment of impact is important for the 
development of strucrural technology, 

and was not available for use in field 
tests as the cameras would have been 
destroyed in the blast. The tools used in 
these tests are particular to the laborato-
ry conditions and are some of the main 
reasons behind the change from field 
tests to simulations. 

"It is very important to us to develop 
analytical tools which allow us to simu-
late these blast loads and their impact 
on structures. So what we're doing here 
is developing a facility which will allow 
us to validate our analytical model and 
tools," Seible said. 

The blast si mulator will be crea ted in 
a site adjacent to the world 's first out-
door shake table, which will be complet-
ed by September 2004 and will be used 
to test structures during simulated 
earthquakes. 

between the schemes was an 
important factor as there are 
limited funds for the expansion 
of both Student Center and 
Price Center and it was impera-
tive for me to ensure that the 
studen ts are getting the most for 
their money," Williams said. 
"Most importantly, the cost dif-
ferential was outweighed by the 
benefits that Scheme II would 
bring to Student Center."

and some more 
services can be

experts consul ted by the BAC, 
the addition of square footage to 
Student Center is less expensive 
than the addition of the same 
square footage to the Price 
Center. This influenced the 
decision for Scheme II, because 
square footage was felt to be 
central to campus development 
as enrollment continues to 
grow. According to Vazquez, it 
is not only the growth in sru-
dents that impacts the spaces, 
but also the growth in student 
organizations that occurs along-
side the influx of students. 

Web: Portal hopes to increase 
online student services 

Scheme II includes every-
thing from Scheme I, with addi-
tional features . It is a more 
comprehensive overhaul of the 
strucrures, including more 
demolition in order to create 
more open outdoor spaces as 
well as more conveniently locat-
ed indoor spaces. It adds 5,000 
gross square feet, which increas-
es the square footage proposed 
in Scheme I by 2,700 gross 
square feet. Although the space 
will be changed drastically to 
create a more open environ-
ment, the · square footage 
increase is the most prominent 
difference between the two 
schemes in the face of srudent 
population growth in coming 
years, 

"The Building Advisory 

According to Vazquez, a 
large portion of the decision to 
choose Scheme II also came 
from the input of the current 
tenants of Student Center. In a 
meeting with University 
Centers director Gary Ratcliff, 
the tenants were asked for input 
as to which scheme they pre-
ferred for their own organiza-
tion. All of the tenants either 
gave no preference between the 
schemes or chose Scheme II. 

"With the additional square 
footage in Srudent Center, 
e;Kisting services will be 
enhanced and some more ser-
vices can be offered," Williams 
said. "These additions will help 
serve the western edge of cam-
pus and continue to provide an 

The necessity to accommo-
date this enrollment was a major 
consideration in the final deci-
sion by the committee, although 
it was not the only factor. 

"No one aspect of the 
scheme is the most important," 
Vasquez said. "It is the total 
package: increased square 
footage to handle increased 
enrollments, larger courtyards 
for more outdoor seating, 
improved layout of the shops, 
services and restaurants, and 
the ability to serve srudents 
that is most important."

online student interaction with blogs 
or online journals specific to the 
UCSD srudent community, neither of 
which are included in the current pro-
posal. 

The most pressing matter, Pascual 
claims, is to make changes to WebReg 
that allow srudents to see professor and 
class evaluations online, view a record of 
completed and required general educa-
tion requirements specific to their 
respective colleges, and access infonna-
tion specific to their major along with 
required classes and which quarters they

largest anti-war rally held on campus in the current academ-
IC year. 

The event, which included a march down Library Walk 
and past UCSD's administrative complex, gathered together 
undergraduate, graduate and faculty speakers. 

"This was defini tely planned in response to the State of 
the Union address and to the U.N. inspections report," said 
Rebecca Anshell, a member of the UCSD Peace Coalition 
and one of the rally's organizers. 

President. George W Bush's Jan . 2S-speech addressed the 
issue of action in Iraq at length, stating that "if Sad dam 
Hussein does not fully disarm ... [the United States) will lead 
a coalition to disarm him" and, in asking other nations to join 
the United States, that "the course of this nation does not 
depend on the decisions of others." 

Several speakers, including lecturer Thomas Cardoza, 
who teaches Making of the Modern World courses at Eleanor, 
Roosevelt College, directly criticized the president's address 
and argued that there is not enough international support for 
a United States-led war in Iraq. 

"It is increasingly clear that the vast majority of people on 
this planet, as well as at least half the people in this country, 
believe that war is not right at this time," Cardoza said .

Mter dedicating the majority of his life to serving the 

UCSO community, F. Thomas Bond has announced his plans 
to retire from his position as Revelle College provost in June 
of this year, though he may still teach. His decision resulted 
from his belief that no one should stay in any position too 
long. 

Bond has been teaching at UCSD for nearly 37 years. He 
has been provost during 20 of those years, which is four times 
longer than any other provost in Revelle's history. 

Bond credits chemistry professor Russell Doolittle for 
recommending him to take on the provost position at Revelle 
over two decades ago.

Protesters against the UCSD School of Medicine's use of

day lab that ends in the euthanizing of the animals. A total of 
24 dogs were ordered this year.

Hospital in Chula Vista. Both doctors have been active in the 
effort to end the use of UCSO's dog labs for over five years, 
conducting surveys of medicine schools nationwide. 

"We tried for five years to go through the appropriate 
committees," Hansen said. "We didn't want to resort to pub-
lic pressure until we had exhausted other options, but we 
hope that this publicity will cause the school to think this 
over again." . 

According to Hansen s survey of all 125 medical schools in 
the United States, which was published in the November 
2002 issue of Americtm Medicine, 95 percent of schools don't 
kill animals in their pharmacology courses, and 82 percent 
don't kill animals in physiology. At most instinltions, accord-
ing to Hansen, the labs have been replaced with computer 
simulations. 

"The best medical schools in the country - Harvard, 
Stanford, Yale, Columbia - don't kill dogs," Harrison said. 
"Why should we?"

In an unexpected move by the A.S . 
Elections Committee, the entire Students 
First! slate was disqualified from the 2003 
election moments before the disclosure of 
the election results on April II. The com-
mittee's ruling, made in response to a griev-

a~ce case heard by the committee earlier the 
same day, was delivered in front of a crowd of 
shocked candidates and their supporters 
gathered at Price Center. 

The grievance filed accused Students 
First! of displaying several campaign posters 
on April 10, violating the decision previously 
imposed by the elections committee in an 
earlier grievance case. The slate was to 
remove all posters by the deadline of 11:59 
p.m. on April 9. 

As a result of the disqualifications, five 
commissioner positions, two senatorial posi-
tions and the office of vice president external 
remain vacant. 

Both candidates and supporters of the slate 
responded strongly to the decision, with boo-
ing and yelling di! ected at the elections com-
mittee being heard for much of the remainder 
of Election Manager Robin Shelton's 
announcements. The disqualified positions 
included Kevin Shawn Hsu for president, 
Moneek Bhati for vice president internal, Rigo 
Marquez for vice president external, Harish 

Nandagopal for vice president finance, five 
cotrunissioner candidates running unopposed 

. and five senatorial positions.

tee decided was right in accordance wi th the

Student fees for resident undergraduates

to $4,984 per year, the UC Board of 
Regents announced on July 17 after raising 
fees an by 25 percent in addition to the 
added 5 percent increase the board autho-
rized UC President Richard C. Atkinson to 
make on top of the latest fee hike if a fur-
ther lack of state funding requires. UC offi-
cials said the president will exercise that 
option after the state budget passed 
through the California legislature on July 
29 with more cuts to the university. 

'The fee proposal is a difficult one, but it 
is only one of many actions being taken to 
cope wi th this budget crisi ," Atkinson said in 
a July 2 letter to the Regents. "I believe [the 
increase) is essential if we are to avoid cutting 
class offerings, increasing class sizes and

for dealing with the budget. 

" I am not willing to accept the 20 percent

Union representatives of 70,000 grocery

The decision came after United Food and

announced that negotiations with grocery 
store chains Ralphs, Albertsons and Vons 
failed to make measurable progress. 

The companies called the strike "a bad 
idea that inflicts economic hardship on 
employees of the companies and inconve-
niences the general public." 

By targeting only on'e company, UFCW 
officials said they hoped to reduce the incon-
venience for consumers. They targeted Vons 
because the company operated the most 
stores in Southern Cali fornia. 

The companies said that a strike against 
Vons constituted a strike against all three, 
and promised that both Albertsons and 
Ralphs would lock out employees in what

UCSD got off to a quick start, scoring in 
the seventh minute. Senior All-American 
Kristin Jones stole the ball at the top of the 18-
yard box. She dribbled around one defender 
and physically overpowered another before 
blasting a shot into the upper right V. 

Emphasizing the importance of the first 
goal, Harrelson said, "It was the play of the 
game." She herself added the next two goals, 
both just as spectacular as Jones' solo display. 

.Her first goal followed a foul near the 
sidelines about 25 yards out. Senior free kick 
and corner kick specialist Christine Wensel

the far post. Wensel put the ball right on the 
money, and Harrelson put it away with a

would include cutting S24.7 million 
in state funding to UC Outreach 
funding, effective Jan. I; withdrawing 
S2 million in funding for labor studies

After the U.S. Open and the 
Redlands Invitational, which 
capped six weeks of weelcly meets, 
UCSD aquatics faced two weeks 
without competition, plus three 
without classes. The athletes did 
not, however, see this time as an 
occasion to ease up in practice. 

For the UCSD swimming and 
diving teams, the term "quarter 
break" is a misnomer; the end of 
fall quarter was anything but a 
break for these students, who 
spent two of their three weeks off 
from school in intense training. 
There were two workouts per day, 
one in the morning and one in the 
afrernoon, that included not only 

UCSD men held an intrasquad 
meet tq avoid having a four-week 
tretch of no competition. 

McGihon commented on the 
effects of "heU week" tr2ining on 
me swimmers' performances. 

"We were tired," he said. "That 
put us at one week into our hell 
week. We had swum really hard the 
day before. You could see the 
fatigue. Everyone put in their best 
effort, but they were tired." 

Although the Triton swimmers 
were slightly slower than usual dur-
ing their difficult training, they 
hope that their rimes will eventual-
ly drop as a result of their hard 
work during the holidays. 

Currently, the UCSD men are 
1-3, while the women are 3-2. 

In January, the women have a 
meet every weekend, while the 
men will compete only twice. 
Both teams will participate in the 
next meet, which is against

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How are Education Inve.tments different from a loan? 
Anawer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The obligation of 
an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage of future income 
for a fixed period of time. This program allows flex ibility in obligation according 
to your economic situation. Which means, you pay less when you have less 
and more when you have more. 
Question: Can the .. Education Investment. pay for all of my tuition? 
Anawer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 
have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but st ill need 
more money for their living costs. REEF can help students fill the gap between 
what you have and what you need. REEF will fund a maximum of $ 10.000 
for cost of attendance expenses per school year. 
Question: How .. U-perc~e rille. d.tennIned1 Will they c'-'P 
throu~t the IIf. of the obll&atlon? 
Anawer: Percentage rates begin: 

0.1% for paduate student. (1/10 of one percent) 
0.2% for unclerpaduat. atudents (1/5 of one percent) 

Rates are speCific to each applicant. Education Investments are awarded 
on a case-by-case basis. The more information a student gives REEF, the 
more accurately a rate is determined. Students are encouraged to inform 
REEF about their goals. career plans, internships, major. test scores, GPA 
and anything else they think is relevant regarding their future.

UCSD women's rugby dominates the field 
Tritons contain key ingredients for a national title 

By ANGELA LIN 
Contributing Writer 

So maybe UC D doesn't have a 
nationally ranked football team -
or a football team at all, for that 
maner. But look no f~urther than 
RIMAC Field and you'll find a 
lineup of 24 die-hard women ready 
to defend their o. 4 ranking thi s 
season. It's not old-fashioned 
American football - it's someth ing 
even beuer, a SpOrt filled with 
harder hi ts, no breaks and fewer 
regulations. Welcome to the world 
of women's rugby. 

T he Tritons ca pped off last 
year's season with a Cinderella-like 
trip to the Final Four, coming in 
foueth place with a \9 -12 loss to 
Penn State at Nationals. 
Established at UCSD in 1996, the 
women's rugby team is raising eye-
brows across the nation with their 
success. It's uncommon for such a 
young program to consistently 
churn out impressive results. 

With only one defeat in their 
preseason, the Tritons arc looking 
to repeat last year's success. This 
time, however, they don't want to 
cut the season off one game short 
of a championship. Doe the team 
have ambition? Yes. Enthusiasm? 
Definitely. Talent? Without a 
doubt, and even more drive than a 
UCSD student during finals week. 

Preseason began in early 
October, with two scrimmage wins 
over Claremont and rival UC Santa 
Barbara. The wins were further 
highlighted by two tournament 
victories, including a Las Vegas 
tournament and UCSD's own 
Scrum by the Sea, both in 
November. 

On the way to their victory in 
the Scrum by the ea tournament, 
the Tritons faced a very competi-
tive UC Berkeley team in the semi-
finals, and then went on to beat the 
200 I ational Champions Chico 
State, 17 - 14, to claim the title. The 
championship marked the th ird 
year in a row that the Tritons won 
the tournamenr. 

The Tritons' only loss came in 
September, in the Beantown 
Collegiate \J\,Tomen's Tournament, 

to a Canadian team. The lady 
Tritons ended up tying for third 
place with Penn State in the tour-
namenr. 

The regular season kicks offJ an. 
31 against UCSB at Warren Field. 

"This rcam is very motivated . 
They know that they could have 
played better [in last year's Final 
Four loss] and know that they're a 
better team this year," said head 
coach Carla Smith, known as 
'Hoova" to her players. "Everyone 
wants to be out there, they consis-
tently come to practice every week. 
T he team knows that the national 
championship is within reach." 

Although the team lacks some 
size compared to last yea r's 
seniors, they' re a different team 
speed-wise. 

"We definitely lost some size 
with our forwards, but we're a 
much quicker and more versatile 
team th.an we were last year -
that 's what we were lacki ng in 

ationals. In the back we're in 
good hand , they tackle well," 
Smith said. "The team is much 
mo re well -rounded this year, 
they're equally strong in the front 
and back." 

The team has been trying dif-
ferent lineups with their 12 return-
ing starters and rookies. The 
Tritons are still getting a feel for 
what works be~t in their lineup, 
with many of the players learning 
and trying out new posi tions to find 
the best fi t. 

As for key players, the team is 
furnished with many all-stars, 
including Jessica Venturi (second 
team All-American in 2002-03) and 
Kirstin Hartos (first team AlI-

ers have made the Southern 
California Representative All-Star 
Team and will play in either the 
Under-23 Inter-Territorial 
Tournament in June 2004 or the 
Senior Women's All-Star 
Tournament held in December 
2003 in Orlando, Fla. 

One of tlle keys to doing well 
this season will be maintaining a 
strong focu .

said. "As long as we don't get 
caught up in the hype, or everyone 
else's expectations and just play our 
game, we'll be fine. We need to 
keep our game plans simple and 
just execute like we know we can." 

Smith expressed similar senti-
ments. 

"A goal [ wo'uld like to see us 
achieve is sticking to our own 
strategies and game plans. If we do 
so, we will win consistently," Smith 
said. 

Another secret to the Tritons' 
success has been their coach of 
three years. Smith has infused the 
women's rugby program with ener-
gy, knowledge and love for the 
game. With a laid-back attitude but 
a demanding work ethic, Smith has 
been a big factor in the Tritons' 
victorious seasons. 

How is it that a sport that is 
arguably only big on the East Coast 
is doing so well in an area in which 
it is still catching on? 

"We have very smart students. 
They are intelligent and can pick 
up drills and the sport very-quick-
ly," Smith said. "These girls are all 
very athletic and are very talented 
- it's not just the coaching. Plus, it 
helps that they have aggre sion. 
Rugby is a sport that you both love 
and are addicted to or you just plain 
hate. It's a sport that really follow 
the 14 assists, one try rule - it 
really just depends on how well the 
team works together." 

The team's goal for this season 
will be to make a run for Nationals 
and bring home a national champi-
onship. 

"We have the potential to do 

even bener than last year," Hartos 
said. "A lot of teams are gunning 
for us and will be using us to mea-
sure the ca liber of their respective 
sides. We've worked very hard to 
get where we are." 

What makes this group of 
women different from any other 
team? 

"We are a pretry tight-knit 
group of young women on and off 
the [field] ," Hartos said. "We're 
not just teammates, but a lot of us 
are roommates and good friends. 
We support each other, live with 
each other, play together, party 
together, take care of each other 
and mostly just care about each 
other." 

A brand new season full of new 
episodes, new characters and new 
plots starts soon.

continued from page 20 

with everal road games. On Dec. 
13 , the team played Gra nd Canyon, 
whom they had lost to just seven 
days earlier. 

"Half of our team gOt the flu on 
that trip," said UCSD basketball 
head coach judy Malone. "We were 
missing some important players, 
and we played tentatively. We 
looked at the tape of the game dur-
ing practice and realized we needed 
to play more aggressively this time. 
We upped the tempo in practice 
and it paid off." 

The hard work during practice 
resulted in a convincing 88-63 vic-
tory over Grand Canyon. Senior 
captain and guard Ali Ginn led the 
UCSD scoring with 25 points and 
freshman guard Buffum added 22 
points. 

"We played a much more 
aggressive and solid game against 
them this ti me," Malone said .

ence game on Dec 15. This game 
U1rned out to be the most lopsided 
victory of the season for the

Notre Dame's score, 94-46. The 
Tritons pl ayed olidly and did not 
allow otre Dame to take the lead 
at any time during tlle game. 

junior center MargaretJohnson 
scored a basket 22 seconds into the 
game and tile Tritons never looked 
back. Ginn led a balanced scoring 
attack with 15 points whileJohnson 

added 14 points and grabbed seven 
rebounds. 

Every member of the Triton 
team scored at least a basket in its 
victory. Malone anributed this to 
the fact that the team is older than 
it has been in a while and tllat they 
are playi ng well together. 

"Our young kids are finally 
juniors and seniors," Malone said. 
"Changing divisions was tough , 
especially with a young team, but 
the experience is starting to show 
and things are coming together." 

The team continued thei r red-
hot play by sweeping through the 
UC San Diego Invitational on Dec. 
29 and Dec. 30. The Tritons 
defeated Humboldt State, 82-63, in 
the semifinal before beati ng 
Central Washington, 91-69, in the 
championship game. 

In the Humboldt State Dec. 29 
victory, the Tritons were led by 
freshman guard Leora Juster witll 
21 points and Gilln witll 20 points . 
Johnson led the game with nine 
rebounds. This victory adva nced 
U SD to the finals against Central 
Washington. 

In th\! championship game 
against Centra l Washington on 
Dec. 30, johnson had 20 points and 
10 rebounds, while four other play-
ers also scored in double digits 
,including sophomore guard 
Andrea lIerold, Juster, Ginn and 
junior forward Katie McGann. All 
but two players scored in this con-
test. It was the second time this sea-

son that UCS D had beaten them. 
UCSD had its first victory uf the 
year in its 79-67 win over Central 
Washington on Nov. 22 . 

Ginn was named the tourna-
ment's Most Valuable Player and 
Juster and Johnson were named to 
the All-Tournament Team. 

Malone realized early in the sea-
son that this was a team that was 
capable of scoring. 

"We knew we could score after 
our (exhibition) game with USD," 
she said. "We have a lot of scorers 
this year .. . a lot of weapons . 
Everybody's playing well ." 

UCSD began a new year by vis-
iting Cal State Los Angeles on Jan. 
2. It kept its winning streak alive 
with a 72-50 victory over the 
Eagles. 

Johnson had 13 points and 13 
rebounds for her second double-
double in as many games. Ginn also 
had 13 points and Juster added 12 
points. With the 22-point win, the 
team won each of their five games 
by at least 19 points, the greatest 
margin of victory being 48 points. 
Both the defense and the offense 
have been playing exceptionally as 
evidenced by the scores. 

"We're playing pretty well," 
Malone said of the five-game win-
ning streak. "We're rebounding 
more than the other teams and we 
have a higher shooting percentage. 
That's why we're winning games. 
Every part of our game is working.

Whell asked about the streak, 
Malone said, "Knock on wood." 

The Tritons hoped to keep their 
impressive record intact when they

on the road on Jan 3. Results of 
that game were unavailable at press

Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball rang in the 
New Year with a win, ending its four-game 
losing streak on Jan. 2. A 55-45 victory 
against California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe Cal State Los Angeles at the 
Eagles Nest in Los Angeles improved 
UCSD's conference record to 2-1. 

Contributing to UCSD's victory was 
junior guard Brandon Francis, who poured in 
a game-high 18 points, scoring on four of 
seven attempts from three-point range. 
Francis had a team-high eight rebounds and 
three steals. Justin Naughton led the Eagles 
and poured in 14 points and II rebounds. 

Before their victory over Cal State Los 
Angeles, the Tritons dropped four straight 
games, including two losses to Division I 
opponents San Diego State and University of 
San Diego. The Tritons also suffered losses 
to Seanle Pacific and to conference rival 
Grand Canyon. 

On Dec. 6, UCSD traveled down 
lnterstate 8 to take on the San Diego State 
Aztecs who have not yet lost to UCSD in 
their previous five marchups. SDSU easily 
defeated UCSD \vith a score of 76-5 1. The 
Aztecs never trailed the Tritons and shot 51 
percent from the floor while UCSD shot 34 
percent. 

Despite the loss, UCSD men's basketball 
head coach Greg Lanthier sees playing 
Division J opponents as a positi ve. 

and first CCM matchup to Grand Canyon, 
62-56. Four Triton players scored double-
digit numbers, led by freshman guard Robby 
Peters and redshirt freshman Adam 
Reinking, each tallying 12 points. Francis, a 
junior newcomer, and sophomore guard 
Matthew Sweany had I I points each, with 
nine of Sweany's points coming in the first

led 49-47 in the second half, but this was its 
last lead of the night. For UCSD, Berling 
and Reinking had 15 and 13 points, respec-
tively, with Berling adding three assists, a 
team-high six rebounds and a game-high 
four steals. The duo also combined for tluee 
dunks, two of them by Reinking. UCSD's 
leading scorer, and junior forward Jesse Boyd 
made his return after a three game absence 
and produced 10 points for the Tritons. 

UCSD lost to their other crosstown 
Division I foe , University of San Diego, on 
Dec. 23. The Tritons lost 81-66 to the 
Toreros on the road. 

The Tritons played competitively, trailing 
32-27 at the half. With only 7: 10 remaining 
in the second half, UCSD led, 60 -56. 
However, the Toreros successfully executed 
plays down the stretch and held on for the 
victory. This loss was the last nonconference 
game of the season for the Tritons.

"We don 't play games that are that fast 
very often," Lanthier said. "Games like this 
will help us prepare for our conference play, 
because not all of the teams in our league get 
this opportunity [to play Division I oppo-
nents.)" 

On Dec. 13, UCSD lost its home opener 

UCSD, with a 2-6 record, r~turned to the 
road in CCAA action on jan. 4, traveling to 
the Torodome in Carson, Calif., to take on 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. Results were 
unavailable at press time. Their next home 
game is on Jan. 9 against Cal Poly Pomona.

Women's soccer disappointed in Final Four 
UCSD loses 2-1 in double overtime to Franklin Pierce 

By ALAN McBROOM 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team marched their way through 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association tournament to be 
crowned CCAA champions on 

ov. 9. Seven members earned 
CCAA honors including Most 
Valuable Player of the Year, 
Freshman of the Year and Coach of 
the Ye·~r. 

The Tritons handed then-No. 1 
Metro State thei r only loss of the 
sea on, winning the final matchup 
of three tightly contested NCAA 
Divi ion II tournament playoff 
games. U 0 earned passage to 
the Final Four in Virginia Beach, 
Va., to face perennial Division IT 
powerhouse Franklin Pierce in the 
emifinals, and the Tritons even 

scored the first goal of the game 
less than four minutes in. 

After a superb eason, the Triton 
women fell 14 seconds short of pro-
longing their CAA championship 
hopes to one more overtime peri-
od. 

Franklin Pierce sophomore 
Sonya IIughes scored the game-
winning goal with only 14 second 
howing on the s oreboard in the 

first sudden death overtime on 
Dec. 4. 

out-shooting their opponents, 8-1, 
and winning the corner kick battle, 
5-0. 

After Triton freshman Megan 
Dickey's tally in the fourth minute 
of the game, UCSD's boots went 
cold. Despite the shot and corner 
advantage, UCSD couldn't find 
the back of the net . The frustra -
tion was not lost on the players or 
the coach. 

"I thought we had it," Dickey 
said. "We dominated much of both 
halves. Unfortunately, it didn't go 
our way." 

UCSD soccer head coach Brian 
McManus expressed similar senti-
ments. 

"It was just a ca e of finishing 
your chances," McManus said. "We 
just didn't quite fini hours." 

UCSD was not alone when it 
came to discouraged scorers. The 
Triton defense limited the opportu-
nities of Meghan Welcome and 
Laura Hislop, Franklin Pierce' two 
star forwards. Combined, the two 
scored 58 of the team 's 86 goals of 
the season. Hislop did manage the 
equalizer in the first half, but the 
back three defenders for UCSD 
played well and held her to one 
goal. 

The final blow wa e pecially 
hard to swallow cons idering 
UC 0 outplayed Franklin Pierce 
in the second half of regulation, 

No.2 Kenne aw State shut out 
Franklin Pierce, 2-0, on Dec. 6 to 
win the NCAA Final Four. This 
was the last season in Division II 
for Kennesaw tate, which will 
move up to Division I beginning 
fall 2004. Sudden death: After beating undefeated No. 1 Metro State at home to advance to the semifinals, the Tritons suffered a 

heartbreakinR loss to Franklin Pierce on Dec. 6 with only 14 seconds left in double overtime. 

Highlights of UCSD's 2003 women's soccer season: 
Od. 5: UCSD exacts revenge on UC Davis for knocking the Tritons out of the 2002 NCAA playoffs in a shootout UCSD wins the rematch, 2-1. .

Nov. 9: UCSD brings home its fourth consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Association title by beating Sonoma State in the semifinals and aushing Cal State Dominguez Hills, 5-1, in

Swimming, diving 
enjoy holiday success 

Delurgio qualifies for 
u.s. Olympic Trials 
By EVA HOFFMAN 

Staff Writer 
While most UCSD students 

studied for fall finals, athletes 
from the swimming and diving 
teams competed on both ends of 
the West Coast. Junior Rosanna 
Delurgio qualified for the 
O lympic Trials in her 100-meter 
breaststroke swim on Dec. 4 at 
the U.S. Open in Federal Way 
Wash. 

D uring the same weekend, on 
Dec. 6, UGSD sent five divers to 
the Redlands Diving Invitational, 
where all five placed eighth or bet-
ter. 

The U .S. Open is one of the 
most important meets in interna-
tional swimming. Many of the 
fastest swimmers from around tht; 
world traveled to Washington to 
compete and to determine where 
they stand as the 2004 lympics 
approach. The meet is so compet-

iti ve that no other NCAA 
Division II team sent swimmers to 
the meet. 

T hree UCSD sWImmers 
attended: Delurgio, senior Denise 
Bogard, and freshman < mily 
Harlan. Delurgio warn the 100 
breaststroke and the 200 breast-
stroke, the events in whieh she 
holds the NCAA Division II 
records. 

Her times in both race were 
lifetime bests. In the 200-meter 
race, she posted a mark of 2 min-
utes and 45.23 seconds. To qualify 
for the July Olympic Trials in the 
100, she needed a 1:12:59 or bet-
ter. Her time of 1:10.5 3 was well 
under the standard and placed her 
third among the Americans at the 
meet. Her overall place was ninth. 

Bogard also swam the 100 
breaststroke, setting a personal 
record of 1:13.55. She came 111
