Subject A program 
still stirs debate 
By JILL COLLEY 
St~J Writer 

(Editor's nOle: This is Pari I of a 
two part examination. Part II 
will run on Thursday, May 26, 
1988.) 

Although some find it poorly 
run and inadequate, this fall an 
estimated 40 percent of incom-
ing freshman wiII stilI be required 
to take the non-credit remedial 
writing course called Subject A. 

"It's kind of a joke," said one 
student, who requested anonym-
ity. "You feel like the teachers 
don't take it seriously either. It is 
all in preparation for this big 
test. I thought it was a waste of 
time," she added. 

Others felt differently. "These 
days, college literacy is in a criti-
cal state. The bottom line is that 
we need courses that teach stu-
dents how to write," said another 
student. 

The Subject A program at 
UCSD, incertain ways, is unlike 
any other Subject A program in 
the UC system. Whether or not 
the UCSD program works is a 
topic continually under debate. 
Dismissal Policy 

A UC system-wide policy 
states that upon admission into 
the University of California, a 
student has three quarters in 
which to complete the Subject A 
requirement. With the exception 
of English as a Second Language 
(ESL) students, if a student fails 
to meet the Subject A require-
ment by the end of his / her third 
quarter, hel she is subject to dis-
missal from the University. 

In March of 1988, the UCSD 
Council of Provosts sent a letter 
to The Committee on Under-
graduate Preparatory and Re-
medial Education regarding the 

Subject A requirement. On the 
topic of dismissal, the council 
stated that in order for "a con-
cept to be a meaningful regula-
tion, enforcement must be fair 
and uniform. Such enforcement 
may require the dismissal of stu-
dents whose other work is 
satisfactory. " 

Chairman of the Council of 
Provosts David Wong was reluc-
tant to disclose the actual number 
of students who have been dis-
missed from UCSD because of 
failure to meet the Subject A 
requirement. "I see no way of 
making that number clearly 
understood," Wong said, who 
added that there are "many dif-
ferent circumstances" surround-
ing each case. He was willing to 
say that "hardly any" students 
were dismissed solely on the basis 
of failing Subject A. 

Coordinator of Subject A 
George Hanson said that there 
are "some UC campuses" that 
enforce this regulation more than 
others . Some UCs are more 
"Ioose"with the policy, he added. 
"This campus, for the moment, 
has chosen to enforce this regu-
lation. We are trying to be good 
academic citizens and live by the. 
regutaflon as It stands," Hanson 
said. 

Bond points out that a dismis-
sal does not mean a student's 
academic career is over. There 
are many ways a student can be 
readmitted. One way is to take 
what is called a "redemption 
exam," which means that a stu-
dent has one last chance to pass 
the Subject A exit exam. A stu-
dent can also complete an equi-
valent course at another college 
and then apply for readmission 
into UCSD. 

According to Hanson, some

Transfer rules for 
UC made uniform 
By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
St~J Writer 

For the past year UC facuIty 
members have been meeting with 
facuIty from the California State 
University system and the Cali-
fornia Community Colleges to 
develop a single transfercurricu-
lum for both UC and CSU. 

As a result of these efforts the 
University of California Aca-
demic Assembly, the legislative 
body of the statewide UC Aca-
demic Senate, adopted a new 
policy earlier this month that 
will make it easier for students at 
California community colleges 
to transfer to any UC campus. 

Students who now meet UC's 
basic eligibility requirements may 
transfer to a UC campus as jun-
iors after having completed a 
single set of courses at any of the 
state's 106 community colleges. 

The new policy does not affect 
upper division or prerequisite 
classes, and it is not a ticket to get 
into the campus of your choice," . 
Academic Senate Officer Dave 
Krough said. "But it is de igned 
to increase enrollment at UC and 
the Academic enate hope it 
will do ju t that." 

Before the new policy wa 
adopted, community college 
tudcnt faced general education 

requirement that varied from 
one UC campus to another. A a 
result, community college courses 
did not alway ati fy the re-
quirement that mo t UC tu-
dent complete during their fir t 
two year . 

The Academic enate , which 

formulates curriculum for UC, 
will now work more closely with 
the faculty of community col-
leges to name courses for the 
transfer-core curriculum and to 
review the content of available 
courses. 

"I think that it does make the 
University more accessible to 
transfer students," said Edward 
Dennis, chairman of the UCSD 
Academic Senate. 

The transfer-core curriculum 
calls for tudents to meet the e 
general education requirement : 
proficiency in a foreign langu~ge; 
English composition (2 seme -
ters or 3 quarters); mathematic 
quantitative reasoning (one 
semester or 2 quarters); arts and 
humanities (3 semesters or 4 
quarters); social and behavioral 
sciences (3 semesters or 4 quar-
ters); physical and / or biologica I 
sciences (2 semesters or 3 quar-
ters). 

"This is a well-focused. rigor-
ous program that will allow a 
student to pursue something that 
will get him somewhere," said 
UCLA Profe sor John Cauble, a 
member of the Senate' Univer-
sity Committee on Educational 
Policy, which helped formulate 
the tran fer policy. 

There wa some discussion 
within the Academic enate 
about whether the tran fer-core 
cour e were demanding or chal-
lenging enough. "Here at UC D 
we had hoped to include more 
foreign language and math in the 
core curriculum requirement ," 
Denni aid .

Students' 
research 
honored 
By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
Associllte News Editor 

At a University ranked first in 
the nation in funds received for 
research from the National 
Science Foundation, only 17 stu-
dents out of 80 participants gave 
presentations in the hard scien-
ces at the first aunual UCSD 
Undergraduate Research Con-
ference Saturday. 

Organized into 15 small 
roundtable discussions at the 
Faculty Lounge, the conference 
was designed to give students a 
sample of graduate school and 
the life of professional scholars 
by recognizing outstanding under-
graduate research. 

Students were first nominated 
by individual departments based 
on recommendations from pro-
fessors, and later narrowed down 
and placed into categories by 
assistant sociology professor and 
conference coordinator Mary 
Freifeld . . 

Each table was made up of 
about five students who each 
gave 15 minute presentations on 
related subjects . They then 
opened the floor to questions 
and discussion from a peer group 
of 10 to 12 students, presided 
over by a faculty member. 

Presentations were distilled 
from papers done for classes, 
individual research projects with 
professors, as well as senior the-
sis topics. 

Out of these 15 tables, two 
were organized into scientific 
topics such as "New Directions 
in Biology" and "Frontiers in 
Physic and Engineering," while 
the other 13 included topics from 
the ocial sciences and the 
humanities such as "Law and 
Society," "Social and Polit ical 
Reform" and "On Literature." 

Vice Chancellor Jo eph Wat-
on, who helped Freifeld organ-

ize the conference, felt the re 
needed to be more repre enta-
tion of both the ciences and the 
humanitie . He a id , however, 
that the imbalance in representa-
tion did how that there is a good 
deal of re earch going on 
in areas other than the hard

"Soft Targets" incorporates live 
theatre and social conscience 

Communicallon department student and faculty 
will be presenting "Soft Target" on Ma y 23, 24, and 
25 at 8 p.m . in MCC 140. "Soft Targets" is an

dismissals have occurred because 
students wait until their second 
or even third quarter to take 
Subject A. This means that if

For this reason , academic

dents did not take the dismissal 
policy seriously. Now that they

much more seriously and more

sity recommendations," Bond said.

Watson hopes to reach more 
students next year by starting to 
advertise early in the fall. "We 
want to encourage all under-
Jl'aduates to consider graduate 
and professional schools and 
teaching professions, .nd the way 
to do this is to foster research by 
having it recognized," Watson 
said. 

Freifeld saw the imbalance as 
a sign that "evidently a lot more 
research is going on in the 
humanities and social sciences in 
undergraduates than we ex-
pected." 

According to biology profes-
sor Paul Salt man, who presided 
with Watson over the discussion 
on "The Individual, Social Roles 
and Society: An Interdisciplinary 
Dialogue," UCSD has the high-
est percentage of undergraduates 
doing research of all the UC 
campuses. 

"We should have been doing it 
[the conference] 100 yean ago," 
S.1tman said. Having just re-

conference, he felt that UCSD 
students should be encouraged

however, that there was an 
obvious "deficiency in the science

Despite the imbalance in re-
presentation of disciplines and 
the problem of having seven dis-
cussions going on at once, both 
participants and faculty reacted 
very positively to their ex-
periences.

Philip Roeder felt the conference

All students must pass the 

SUbjt.ct A exam incl uding ES l 
students. However, the Univer-
sity recognizes that these students 
may need additional time and 
special instruction before enter-
ing into the Subject A course. 
Therefore, as long as ESL stu-
dents have registered in an ESl 
course, they have up to an addi-
tional year to take Subject A. 

Terrell said that there were 
some students who chose not to 
follow the recommended path of 
instruction and as a result found 
themselves subject to dismissal. 
Also, some students were taking 
ESL courses and Subject A con-
currently. 

"The set-up between Subject 
A and ESl is to try to avoid 
dismissal, " Terrell said . For this 
reason, an important change has 
been made regardi ng designated 
ESL students entering UCSD 
next fall . For these students, 
ESL courses will be "required " 
rather than " recommended" 
before a student can enroll in 
Subject A. 

Errata 
The article "Tipsy Taxi 

services drained" from the 
Thursday. May 19 issue of 
the Guardian incorrectly 
stated that the A . S. an-
nounced that a shull/e ser-
vice to the airport would 
operate during the holiday 
season for residents. In 
actuality it is only a program 
that was proposed at the 
A .S. council meeting. The 
Guardian regrets this error. 

According to Tracy Terrell , 
director of language programs, 
ESL courses were recom-
mended but not required for 
those students who qualified for 
special instruction. If a student 
chooses not to enroll in ESl 
courses, then the Subject A 
course must be completed within 
three quarters.

Cleansed Che 
"It is nor only a question of youth and confidence 

although these things are very beautiful. EIlch night 
I am relucrant to close up because there may be 
someone who needs the cafe . .. 

-Ernest Heminc"ay 
"A Clean, Well-Lichted Place" 

There are a few places to pass the hard times, the 
times between those sweet love affairs when we feel 
strong and sure of where we are and what we can do . 

We have such a place here, in a eucalyptus grove, 
set back from the campus with simple wooden 
benches and good food . It's worth keeping. 

That is, the Che Cafe is worth keeping. 
The administration tried to close it last week , but 

it d idn't take. The collective member.:; .,aid no , we 
have put too much work into this place, and no, this 
is ours, not yours, and no, this is part of what we 
believe in. 

The administration closed the Che hastily, based 
on concerns that had already been addressed about 
sanitation conditions; with the kitchen sealed and a 
clea n-up of the grounds completed, the discovery of 
a solitary rodent chased into the kitchen during the 
final sealing push was inconsequential. 

Further, the administration closed the Che with-
out relying on its own health and sanitation offi-
cials. All the Che asked, and what the admini-
stration finally agreed to accept, was to abide by the 
results of a legitimate health inspection. The Che 
passed the inspection from both campus and county 
health officials easily. 

Finally, the administration closed the Che in 
violation of its own agreement with the Che to abide 
by the inspections. They reneged on the agreement 
two days after it was made and two days before the 
inspection. 

No one wants an unsafe place to eat on campus, 
least of all the Che people, who derive so much 
sustenance beyond just food from their work . 

A tlantis II Fiasco 
In the words of every woman 's first husband , the 

man who may be our next president, "We're in deep 
do-do . " 

We 're referring to the seizure of the SSO million 
oceanographic research vessel, Atlantis II, because 
marij uana residue was found in two pipes stashed in 
a sailor's shaving kit. 

The U.S. government's take-no-prisoners drug 
policy finally picked on someone with clout. The 
boat's owner is none other than the National 
Science Foundation, which among other things , 
gave UCSD Chancellors McElroy and Atkinson. 
. The seizure endangered millions of dollars worth 

of research planned years in advance. Friday, faced 
with a firestorm of scientific and congressional 
criticism , the Customs Service and the Coast Guard 
agreed to return the ship on the grounds that the 
NSF didn't know that a crew member would have 
about 1/ 100 of a gram of marijuana with him. 

Letting the puni hment fit the crime is a key part 
of our Constitution; the Seventh Amendment to the 
Constitution reads, in entirety, "Excessive bail shall 
not be required , nor excessive fines imposed, nor 
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted ," 

If Customs and the Coast Guard have reason to 
suspect a vessel is engaged in drug importation, and 
they find those drugs, a reasonable fine or penalty 
should be adopted. Bullying some poor fisherman 
or sportsman is not just stupid - it's unconsti-
tutional. We're lucky the government picked on 
someone big enough to fight back . 

Congress should act to reform lh~ seizure policy 
immediately and provide for the return of already-
seized boats. 

h 's ironic that the Reagan Administration , elected 
to "get the government off our backs," has executed 
the most vindictive invasion of property and perso n-
al rights in years .

Yes on 70 
Editor: 

With all the attention being given 
to the Presidential candidates, you'd 
think that the only thing on the June 
7 ballot will be the names of the 
candidates . 

Of the other items on the ballot, 
one worth mentioning and voting 
for is Proposition 70, the Wildlife, 
Coastal, and Park Land Conserva-
tion Bond Act. Proposition 70 will 
save part of wild California so 'that 
future generations can enjoy Cali-
fornia's native beauty. 

One thing is certain: politicians 
will come and go, but when a native 
habitat is lost it's gone forever.

UC Agency Did 
The Peeking 
Editor: 

Without debating the merits of 
your opinion, I hasten to point out 
that the portion of your editorial 
relating to the Bard-Alan Finlan 
[Guardian, May 16] is factually 
incorrect in that his records have not 
been "opened to an extra-university 
agency" nor is it correct to state as a 
matter offact that "UCSO's actions 
were and are clearly illegal. .. " 

Your opinion about the nature of 
a particular subject is just that, an 
opinion, and I would hope that in 
future editorials you would be more 
careful to distinguish between your 

"opinion" and matters that are 
presented as objective fact . 

Nichola. S, Alunar 
Director, UA/Speclal Services 

(Ediror's note: Ihe records were 
opened by another, inappropriately 
authorized university agency; we 
apologize/or the confusion. Aguilar 
is correcl that it is our "opinion" 
that the university's actions were 
illegal and we stand by that opinion). 

Why Not More 
Third Articles? 
Editor: 

The Guardian is purported to be 
the most unbiased newspaper on 
campus, but in the past couple of 
years I have noticed certain biases 
against Third College. I am a Third 
student, and I do like being informed 
on the problems the college has had 
and how they have dealt with them, 
but maybe I am under an illusion 
that the press should report both 
sides, the negative and positive. 

When you reported on UCSD's 
Open House [Guardian , Apr. 25] 
the Renaissance Fair and the Life 
Helicopter were mentioned , but all 
you reported on Third College was 
about the Third College elections 
being recalled. 

There was no mention of the 
successful and well-attended Cultur-
al Celebration sponsored by Third 
College during Open House . As a 
UCSD student I feel that the positive 
aspects should be reported as well as 
the problems, for how else will our 
school be given the recognition that 
it is due? Notoriety is fine as long as 
it is deserved, but so is the pat on the 
back .

Setting Goals at 
The Che Cafe 
Editor: 

What is the Che Cafe? 
"A vegetarian restaurant" would 

be a narrow response. The Che Cafe 
and its collective members have been 
and are currently involved in many 
aspects of the "U(:SD experience." 
The diverse and frequently all-cn-
compassing concerns of many col-
lective members are often very much 
a part of their involvement with 
Che. 

Why has the alleged "rat prob-
lem" become such a heated issue? In 
my five years of experience at UCSD 
I have frequently seen the Che critic-
ized by the administration. [Univer-
sity Center Director] Jim Carruth-
ers has the job of addressing any 
criticism directed toward the Co-
ops. Yet, his recent actions would 
indicate he is overstepping his juris-
diction by involving himself in any 
way he sees fit. The Che Collective 
has frequently expressed the opin-
ion they are under attack because of 
their politics and ideology. I, myself, 
have seen and heard evidence to 
support such allegations. Jim Car-
ruthers has mentioned to me that he 
believed bulldozing the Che and 
building something more "cost ef-
fective" is a viable option. 

Legally the administration can't 
justify criticism of the Che based on 
the politics of the Collective. Yet, 
many of the incidents requiring 
interaction between the adminstra-
tion and the Che escalate into heated 
political arguments. Even though I 
believe there are administrators who 
would rather the Che did not exist, I

WILC a Casualty of UCSD Indifference 
Editor: 

Did anyone notice the absence of the "Women in 
Leadership" conference (WI LC) this year? The WILC 
was started last year by the Women's Resource Center 
(W RC) as a forum for women leaders to relate their 
experiences. By all standards, it was a success and 
enthusiastically recei ved . 

I went to the WRC to ask about the conference. It 
was cancelled due to lack of funding - 58,000 short of 
the 512,000 needed . A volunteer at WRC told me that 
the administration does not see a "need" for any 
"input" from the students to fund more women's 
programming. Is this because: (I) The adminilitration 
doesn't want to see a need ; (2) no one except a few 
radicals care about the status of women on this 
campus ; (3) no one knows how to get things orlanized 
and therefore the potential is lost; or (4) some other 
8ituation? / 

I 
The fact that UCS D, of all ues, has the lowest 

funding for the women's issues and has no women's 
studies major (SDSU 
does) seems to say 
UCSD doesn't consider 
women and their issues 
as important. 

What is the opinion 
of women and men 
about the demise of the 
"Women in Leadership" 
conference and status of 
feminist issues? I am 
curious to hear from 
students, faculty and 
staff.

using such an argument in work-

most important: the effective 
operation of the Che Cafe. Argu-
ing with the administration about 
who is right and wrong is simply 
draining the Collective's energy. 

There is obviously a strong 
need for an alternative food ser-
vice such as the Che Cafe on 
campus. The Che will exist as 
long as it has support. However, 
administrators will continue to 
criticize the Che as they see fit. 
Much of the criticism, if taken in

for improvement of the Co-ops. 
Ultimately, the survival of the 
Che is dependent upon the Col-
lective. Threats of shut-down

they are simply idle harassment.

Running a vegetarian restaur-
ant and a programming collec-
tive requires an intense amount 
of commitment, energy and time. 
Dealing with a lack of University 
policy with respect to Co-ops, 
and the inconsistencies of a 
seemingly unsupportive admin-
istration requires the same. 
Attending UCSD falls into th is 
category, too . Che Cafe Collec-

tive members are frequently in 
the position of doing all three. 
Focusing on the immediate 
problems may be an effective 
method of alleviating some of 
the pressure. Attempting to have 
Jim Carruthers fired is simply 
wasted energy. The Che Cafe's 
power stems from the support of 
individual students, staff, faculty 
and administrators who use the 
facility and realize its value.

OPINION 

Dukakis Will Increase Dollars for Education 
By JACKIE KERMANI 
Slgff W,ilt, 

M ichael Dukakis, gover-nor of Massachusetts, is currently the Demo-
cratic front-runne r in the 1988 
Presidential race . Dukakis and 
the Republican candidate, Vice 
President George Bush. have 
already visited California to gain 
support , contributions, and mo-
mentum. 

that has worked succe sfully for 
him in Mas achusetts which he 
hopes to spread across the nat ion 
is "investing in people." All kinds 
of people, young, old, men , 
women, white, black, Hispani.: 
and Asian . Dukakis feels this is 
important "not as an act of char-
ity - not simply because our 
hearts go out to people in need , 
important though that may be -

but beca u e we understand that 
all of us live richer and better 
lives in a society in which all of us 
have the opportunity to achieve 
the best that is in us - and make 
real co ntributions to our com-
munity." 

Dukak is has two fundamental 
goals in mak ing his vision real. 
The first is to build an "economic 
environment that is creative and 

innovative ... and ... second . an 
all-out assau lt on the causes of 
poverty and dependency - not 
just the treatment of their symp-
toms and consequences." 

So as voter regi tration drives 
begin and candidates start com-
ing to Cal iforn ia to meet the 
vo ters, learn a bout their plat-
forms , both Republican and 
Democrat. Gov. Michael DukaKis _ 

Du1ca1cis was born of Greek 
immigrants in Brookline, Mas-
sachusetts in 1933. He has had 
much government experience, 
first as a state representative and 
then as governor of Massachu-
setts. Also, he was a moderator 
of public television's The Ad-
vocates. 

Dukakis' success in Massa-
chusetts is well-known. When he 
was inaugurated, the common-
wealth faced a deficit of over half 
a billion dollars. Under the-

Dukakis Administration , un-
employment dropped from 12 to 
4.3 percent. 250,000 new jobs 
were added and crime dropped 
substantially. When Dukakis left 
office in 1979, Massachusetts 
state government had a budget 
surplus of S200. 

When I met Governor Duka-
kis in Washington, D.C .. I had 
the opportunity to talk to him 
about his unique ET (Employ-
ment and Training Choices) 
Program. ET has been successful 
in helping more than 30,000 wt::l-
fare recipients find jobs. This 
program nOI only assists in edu-
cating these welfare recipients 
and single parents. but follows 
thro ugh by as uring placement 
in a Job Thl Innovative pro-
gram S3\cd taxpayer an esti-
mated $10 mllhon in 1986 alone. 

L akt feels trongly about 
college 0ppMtunllv. "A good 
college edu auo n IS one of the 
best doorways to a good and 
productive life. And our nation 
can't afford to have many of our 
best students denied the chance 
to attend college because they 
can't afford rising tuition 
costs ... " noted Du ka1cis.

San Onofre power Rlant 

Nuclear 'lemon' threatens to turn sour 
By Steve Hoffman 
Guardian Inurn 

[f you asked some an Die-
gan what they knew about San 
Onofre, you'd probably be war-
ned that traffic start backing up 
"just after the bend" or that the 
surf and fishing are pretty good . 
According to a recent study by 
the D .C-based Critical Mas 
Energy Project, however, San 
Onofre is also the home of a 
nuclear lemon. 

The findings of the study were 
recently published in a report, 
"Nuclear Lemons : An Assess-
ment of America's Wor t Com-
mercia[ Reactors ," which was 

relea ed to coincide with the 
recent two-year anniversary of 
the accident at Chernobyl. 

The report, which listed the 15 
most inefficient and unsafe reac-
tor in the U.S., contains dis-
turbing evidence consistent with 
findings of the Nuclear Regula-
tory Commi sion which suggest 
that San Onofre may not be as 
innocuous as it looks. 

[n the category of RC-im-
posed fines for federal violations, 
San Onofre Unit I was the eighth 
worst in the nation, and was the 
mo t costly reactor in terms of 
repairs . A!! three reactor at San 
Onofre were among the 15 cost-
liest reactors for operation and 

maintenance and were among 
the 34 plants in the nation found 
to have steam generator pipe 
corrosion which could lead to a 
serious "loss-of-coolant acci-
dent." the report said . 

The Alliance for Survival's 
Community Energy Action Net-
work, which co-released "Nuclear 
Lemon," also warns that there 
are many other categories in 
which San Onofre fai ls that are 
not covered by the report. For 
example, evacuation plans cover 
only a ten-mile radius from the 
plant , and in the event of panic, 
bottlenecks in traffic which al-
ready exist would render the 
plan useless. 

San Diego museum caters 
to kids of all ages 
BySHERYLB.GARDEN 
Guardian Intern 

With a skeleton , a television 
studio, building tools, and a 
theater, this place may seem to 
be a little confusing. However , 
its many visitors do not find it 
that way at a[1. 

To the children of San Diego, 

this is the place where dreams are 
made, where they can become 
the next Tom Brokaw or Leon-
ardo Da Vinci. It is the Child-
ren's Museum of San Diego, 
located in the La Jolla Village 
Square shopping center . 

"The museum is about learn-
ing through play. It is like any 
ot her museum, but it is on a

child's [evel, "said Denise Biggert, 
administrative assistant and 
spokesperson. "By enjoyi ng them-
selves and playing, they are also 
learning. " 

The Children's MuseumofSan 
Diego was patterned after a 
similar museum in Boston. It 
was founded in August, 1983 
and is "proud to be celebrating 
[its] fifth birthday th is year," 
Biggen added. 

Run by volunteers, 25 percent 
of whom are students from local 

" The museum is 
about learning through 
play. It is like any other 
museum, but it is on a 
child's level." 

-Denise Biggert 
Spokesperson 

hig h schools, San Diego State 
U niversity, and UCSD, the 
museum offers a wide variety of 
activities for children, including 
classes in art, drama , and dance. 
rhese classes are available for 

children ranging in age from two 
to 14 and are relatively inexpen-
sive . 

UCSD tudent Jeff Symon has 
worked for the museum as a 
magician, and he and his fratern-
ity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, are 
currently working on the Fiesta 
Grande Dos, the museum 's an-

Furthermore, radiation carried 
by San Onofre's offshore winds 
could potentially blanket Orange 
County, one of the fastest-gro-
wing areas in the nation, while 
delays in notifying the pUblic, 
such as those at Chernobyl and 
Three Mile Island, could also 
make the San Diego area the 
sight of a major disaster. 

Jim Jacobsen , a coordinator 
for CEAN, also warn that per-
sonnel at San Onofre have been 
found to be very lax and unpre-
pared for a crisis. Employees at 
the plant have been cited for 
drug and alcohol use , and secur-
ity officers were found to be deal -
ing drugs - all while on duty, 

JaCObsen said. 
Jacobsen charges that "for 

obvious reasons, no matter how 
well you train, there is no way 
that an intoxicated crew can 
respond to a nuclear crisis." 

Another threat which San 
Onofre poses is to Southern 
California resources such as 
inland agriculture and the Colo-
rado River. Damage to these 
could cost billions of dollars in 
only short term effects, and 
Jacobsen urges that when long-
term effects are considered with 
all other factors , San Onofre 
becomes an "insane location for 
a nuclear plant ." 

While many trust that San 
Onofre will be kept safe by the 
industry itself and by regulators 
such as the NRC, a 1987 report 
from the Congressional Over-
sight Committee found that "the 
NRC has in some critical areas 
abdicated its role as regulator 
altogether with an unhealty em-
pathy for the needs ofthe nuclear 
industry ... which could lead to 
an accident which could have 
disastrous consequences." 

As for the likelihood of such 
anevent ,in 1986theNRCgaveit 
a 45 percent chance within the 
next twenty years, and according 
to many onlookers, public aware-
ness could be the only way to 
prevent it from happening here.

Another UCSD student, 
Marla Schneid man , works with 
the public relations department. 

"I first became involved with 
the Museum with my intern hip 
through AI P [Academic Intern-
ship Program]. A an intern, I 
spent five hours a week on the 
[main] floor, interacting with the 
children and answering questions 
from parents," Schneidman said . 
"It's really a great place." 

Michelle Wolf, a photo intern 
and media major at UCSD, 
thinks the internship program is 
"a wonderful way to obtain real 

world expericnce." She wishes 
that the University would offer 
more internships to its students 
for them to obtain "hands-on 
experience in their fields ."

Sci-fi convention explores 
the final frontier 
By JOHN VON ASPEN

They came from the innermost 
reaches of UCSD. From forgot-
ten computer labs, from the base-
mentsof AP&M,anddownfrom 
the rafters of .s&E library. By 
Sunday they had swarmed over 
Peterson Hall and thrust it for-
ward into the 24th Century. 

Dark Star, the UCSD science 
fiction club, hosted the event, a 
Star Trek/ Science Fiction Con-
vention which lasted the entire 
day. 

The convention spanned the 
entirety of the Star Trek phe-
nomenon and included selections 
from the original television 
series, the four feature films, and 
the latest Star Trek series, "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation." 

Majel Barrett Roddenberry, 
who played Nurse Chapel on the 
original series, and who is also 
the wife of series creator Gene 
Roddenberry, spoke to a crowd 
of80and told ofthe early days of

the topics of love, sex, war and 
race were all taboo in Holly-
wood. Yet, she explained, the 
show often found ways around 
such censorship by shifting the 
locale of these conflicts to other 
planets. 

In pres.!nting conflicts between 
alien races and human beings in 
distant galaxies, the show was 
able to confound the censors and 
make an allegorical commentary 
on the contemporary human 
condition. 

"Everyone of the Star Trek 
episodes that Gene made had 
some sort of message," Rodden-
berry said . 

According to Roddenberry, 
the original pilot of the series 
had cast Roddenberry as second 
in command, but Hollywood 
executives of the time felt that 
neither a woman as First Officer 
nor Mr. Spock's pointed ears 
were believable. Spock got to 
keep his ears, with a reduction of 
their size, but Majel Rodden-
berry was demoted to being Dr.

Chapel . 
Network executives also felt 

the show was too "cerebral" 
Roddenberry said . But the 
show's tremendous following 
and longevity in re-runs proved 
Roddenberry's initial intuition 
that the public wanted more to 
think about than the inane tele-
vision shows of the time. 

"We always suspected that 
there was an intelligent life form 
on the other side ofthe T. V. set ," 
Roddenberry said. 

Other featured speakers in-
cluded two production specialists 
for "Star Trek: The Nex.t Gener-
ation" who showed bloopers 
from the show and discussed its 
promising future. UCSD Pro-
fessor Stephen Potts also gave a 
lecture comparing the old and 
new versions of Star Trek. 

A charity auction of various 
Star Trek Movie memorabilia 
capped off the day's events with 
all of the day's proceeds going to 
the Ronald McDonald House 
charity.

throughout the year. Though 
many student have partaken of 
the entertainment, mo t do not 
consider the source and funding 
of these activities, which allow 
the Revelle Pla7a events to take 
place . 

The Revelle Noon Program-
ming Board ( RNPB) takes most 
of the responsibility for making 
these attraction possible. Con-
sisting of a committee of 12, this 
group works closely with four 
Revelle interns to create and 

ca rry out ideas and themes for 
daytime programs. Working with 
a fairly small budget, the com-
mittee relie heavily on proceeds 
from it food sales, as well as 
part of tudent registration fees , 
to pay for entertainment when 
necessary. Bands will usually 
entertain for free, and as students 
enjoy the music they, in turn, 
benefit from public exposure. It 
is no wonder that bands are a 
popular item on the committee's 
agenda. 

The Commuter Advisory 

Board also lend s a hand in 
planning activities, placing spe-
cial interest on the commuter 
popUlation. One of its main goals 
is to increase commuter-resident 
interaction through such events 
as game show and I;Veekly 
movies in the Commuter Lounge. 
New suggestion are continually 
added to their long list of ideas, 
which will undoubtedly make 
for some interesting engage-
ments.

Continued from pale 10 
Events Office will sponsor Plaza 
entertainment, but the majority 
of the time, these events are 
sponsored by RNPB. 

This year, there has been a 
Plaza event every Friday, and 
practically every Wednesday of 
the quarter. Among the many 
programs made possible this 
year, there have been comedy 
acts, fashion shows, cultural 
affairs, free haircuts, and an 
animal show. Reaching an es-
timated 200-300 people, the out-
door setting has proven to be a 
major factor in attracting a 
variety of students, Keeping this 
in mind, one Revelle intern 
suggested that students should 
"be aware of different interest 
groups." 

So far, Plaza events have met 
with great success, and RNPB 
continues to plan ahead with 
such upcoming engagements as 
the "The Win, Lose or Draw 
Tournament," a martial arts 
demonstration, "The Fun in the 
Sun Fair," and a fashion show 
sponsored by the Barbizon 
School of Modeling. The annual 
Watermelon Drop will also make 
its way to the Plaza on June 10, 
with a band, barbeque and, of 
course, free watermelons. 

These outdoor activities not 
only serve to entertain, but 
provide a much-needed network 
of social interaction that may 
too often be lacking from the 
University atmosphere.

Subject A 
Continued from pale 3 
that a student must remain in 
ESL courses all year. Instructors 
of these courses can recommend 
that a student begin the Subject 
A course at any point during the 
year. Also, students can make 
requests to be tested to deter-
mine if they are ready to enroll in 
Subject A. 
Alternadve Plan Rejected 

Subject A is not a new class. It 
has been in the UC system since 
1898. In the summer of 1984, a 
committee of administrators and 
faculty met and reviewed several 
alternative models of instruction 
for the Subject A course at 
UCSD. This committee, called 
The Subject A Task Force, 
recommended the Mesa College 
model. 

"The thing that shocked me 
the most was that a serious Uni-
versity would admit students and 
then send them to a community 
college, said Charles Cooper, 
UCSD's director of writing pro-
grams. In November of 1984 
Cooper submitted an alternative 
Subject A model to the Commit-
tee on Educational Policy (CEP). 

tors are Mesa employees, they 
are paid only for the amount of 
hours in the classroom. They are 
not paid for office hours, and 
UCSD does not supply them 
with offices. He feels that stu-
dents are at a real disadvantage 
ina writing course where they can't 

Subject A Coordinator George 
Hanson 

have conferences with their 
instructors. 

ual tutorials, funding has been 
provided to OASIS specifically 
for Subjer.t A students. Whether 
or not this is a good method of 
dealing with the "inherent prob-
lem," Hanson said , "is an open 
question, but that is what the 
campus has provided ... 

UC system-wide regulations 
insist that a student complete 
Subject A before going on with 
other required college writing 
courses. Cooper had hoped that 
UCSD might obtain a variance 
that would allow students to 
take the Subject A course in con-
junction with their general edu-
cation courses. 

1Writing] is a complex human 
performance inseparable from 
students' intellectual develop-
ment. Hence, remedial writing 
will be more effective and effi-
cient if it parallels rather than 
precedes 'University'writing and 
reading," Cooper said. 

Under Cooper's Subject A 
proposal , Subject A instructors 
would not be employees of Mesa 
College working in a cooperative 
situation with UCSD. Instead , 
they would be employed by UCSD 
as lecturers." As part of the cam-
pus community, we can make 
demands on them for office 
hours, meeting students in con-
ferences and so on," Cooper said. 

per week plus private student 
conferences. 

The current Mesa Subject A 
course requires a minimum of 
five hours of class time weekly. 
Cooper said the only reason for 
this is that Mesa courses are 
offered on a semester schedule. 
In order for Subject A to be a 
legitimate Mesa course, UCSD 
students in one quarter must 
take as many hours as Mesa Col-
lege students have to take in one 
semester. 

Cooper's alternative program 
w~s revie~ed but ultimately 
rejected by the CEP in favor of 
the Mesa College program. "The 
[CEP] is a committee of my col-
leagues and other faculty mem-
bers so I respect their judgment. 
We just disagree," Cooper said . 

Transfer 
Continued from pale I 
at the University of California 
that we work in as close and 
cooperative a partnership as 
possible with the community col-
leges," said UC President David 
P . Gardner in a statement.

Dr. William Thwaites is a mem-

By ROBERT LEONE 
SmitH St~ Writer 

Peterson HalI 108 was packed 
with a near-capacity crowd that 
had come to see the May 18 
debate between Dr_ Duane Gish 
of the Institute for Creation 
Research and Dr. William 
Thwaites of the Biology De-
partment at SDSU _ More than 
three hours later, the crowd was 
reduced to die-hard debate fans _ 

The debate, sponsored by the 
Intervarsity Christian FelIow-

debate: Questioning

spectators and a discussion mo-
derator. UCSD undergraduate 
Stephen Goldberg. 

The good-humored Dr. 
Thwaites started his one-hour 
opening speech by giving his 
motivation for participating in 
the debate_ Among his several 
reasons, Thwaites said, " Maybe 
tonighl will be the night that Dr. 
Gish will crack." 

Thwaites also questioned the 
ralionale behind the debate ques-
tion " Does the scientific evidence 
support the theory of evolution 
or the theory of special creation 
as an answer to the development 
of Life (sic)?" Thwaites stated 
that the theory of evolution does 
not concern the origins of life but 
life's subsequent development_ 

Dr _ Gish opened his discussion 
by statinl, "The issue is: How 
did the universe and it's inhabi-
tants come into existence?" Gish 
presented probabilistic arlu-
ments against the conventional 
picture of all matter in the

universe originating from a mas-
sive cloud of hydrogen in space_ 
Gish also claimed that while 
evolution says that matter will 
tend to move toward a state of 
greater orga nization, the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics shows 
that matter over time tends to 
disorder . According to Gish . 
creatiollism does not contradict 
the Second Law of Thermo-
dynamics. 

After two hours of initial 
speeches there was a 10 minute 
intermission. This was followed 
by a half-hour rebuttal period 
where each speaker lot 10 then 
five minutes. Afteranotherinter-
mission. there was a 30 minute 
period where questions submit-
ted in writinl by the SpectatOR 
were addressed to the partici-
pants. Gish and Thwaites were 
then given two minutes for a 
final summation_

Dr. Duane Gish represents the 
Institute of Creation Research. 

"The sponsorship ofthe debate 
makes the 'how' thing stacked," 
Hunt said and he also noted that 
on the prolram Dr_ Gish was 
always the last one to speak. 
Another factor that disturbed 
Hunt was that Gish was taking 
quotations "out of context_" 

"As a Christian I'm disturbed 
by the intellectual dishonesty," 
Hunt said . 

Peter Ma, a Warren Pre-EECS 
student, had a different point of 
view. 

"I'm a Christian, and Gish is 
makin, a lot more sense, espe-
cially during the rebuttals."

Coach's Box 
Enthusiasm is the name 
of this man's game 
By PATTY JETTIE 
GUllrdian Intern 

I t isa warm and breezyspringdayat UCSD. On Muir field, a large man is preparing to speak in front of a group of local high 
school students. The kids look bored , anticipat-
ing yet another dull speech about something 
that doesn't interest them. As the man lumbers 
pp to the front of the group, everyone does a 
double take when he bellows, "My name is ... 
BOB MOSS! And I'm here to talk about 
ENTHUSIASM! Hubba jubba!" Arms out-
stretched, a huge grin splashed his face, Bob 
Moss looks like the happiest man on earth. 

And so he may be. If you look up the word 
"enthusiasm" in the dictionary, you11 see a pic-
ture of this man grinning back at you. Yet mere 
words fail to convey the true essence of the 
man. Just being around him makes you feel 
better about your elf; he' the kind of man who 
can make you laugh with a look and a word. It 
is this ability to pread laughter, combined with 
his undying enthu ia m, that has become the 
Moss trademark . 

To Moss, a physical education teacher for 
UCSD, confidence and enthu iasm are nothing 
more than looking like you know what you are 
doing. "Fake it 'til you make it" is the policy 
Moss lives by. 

Moss enjoys sharing his enthusiasm with 
others and often peaks to a variety of audien-
ces, from high chool students to groups of 
California Interstate Bankers. Thi year he has 
spoken to the Muir dorms, seven UCSD inter-
collegiate teams, the Revelle R.A. 's, and the 
Black staff organization; in the past two month 
alone he has given a presentation at three state 
and one national physical education conferen-
ces. Whether improving Padres manager Larry 
Bowa's overall game performance or helping 
high school students to "stand out in a crowd," 
Moss' formula for success is based on one 
thing: the power of laughter. 

"Discover your best laugh and share it 10 
econds longer everyday," Moss said . "Think 

how much happier a year from now, ten years 
from now, you could be if you lengthened your 
laugh every day!" According to Moss, laughter 
allows a person to get rid of both tension and 
frustration. When a person laughs, certain 
endorphins are released into the blood, produc-
ing an energy high that is similar to the effect of 
ugar. A good belly laugh allows the person to 

feel better about himself, which paves the route 
to improving one's elf esteem, Mos!\ said. 

Moss uses enthusiasm as a way to boost a 
person's self confidence. A UCSD football and 
tennis instructor, he tries to get students to use 
audio and mental imagery in order to break 
down the problems they are having within their 
sport. While helping a tennis player, " We taped 
his serve over and over. .. [Iater] he could listen 
to the sound of the erve, picturing the racquet 
hitting the ball in his mind." 

It is in his class "Accelerated Improvement of 
Motor Skills" that he is able to provide stu-
dents with a wide exposure to a variety of 

sports technique. Geared toward different 
athletic abilities , the students make "purely 
positive" motivation tapes; students give a 
speech onto the tape telling how they have 
already achieved their goal. Moss feels that this 
verbal step will increase an individual's self 
confidence. Moss believes that "every sport 
skill has a rhythm to it; if you can create it by 
your mouth, then that's the realization of 
success. " 

Accord ing to Moss' tennis teaching assistant 
Jen Cassidy, Moss "is unique because through 
hi enthusiasm his students feel successful with 
each small progression they make in their 
sport. " 

Emily Fong, a tudent in one of Moss' soft-
ball classe , agrees. "He really gets everyone 
motivated . I really get a lot out of this class," 
said Fong. 

So when you pass Moss on campus, don't be 
surprised if he approaches you with a mischie-
vous grin on his face. If he starts laughing at 
nothing in particular, join him. You will be 
surprised how good it makes you feel.

Men's golf finishes 
14th at Nationals 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's golf team 
never really found their form 
after their first round at the 
NCAA National Tournament, 
finishing tied for 14th place with 
Central College of Iowa. 

The tournament was limited 
to three rounds because of rain 
during the first day of play. 

Joost Steenkamer finished the 
tournament with a 236 despite 
shooting a 76 after the first round 
of competition. Sharm Newbold 
shot a 235, the Tritons' lowest 
score, also after shooting a 76 in 
the first round. 

Fritz Reber began with an 82, 
but then recovered in the second 
round with a 74, the Tritons' 
lowest round in the tournament. 
Reber finished with a 237 score. 

Mike Reinhardt and Brad 
Shupe finished the first round 
with cores of 84 and 85, respec-
tively, but managed to come 
around in the second and third 
rounds to finished with a 244 

while Shupe shot 82s, giving him 
a 54-hold total of 249. 

After the second round of 
competition, the Tritons found 
themselves in II th place, an 
improvement over their 13th 
place position from the first 
round. 

Cal State Stanislaus main-
tained their first place position 
with a team round of 303 to 
bring their total to 599 after two 
rounds. Among the top individ-
uals after the second round was 
Glenn Andrade of Stanslaus, who 
shot a 72 the first round and a 
73 in the second round . 

Other top individuals were 
Doug Trenor of the University 
of North Carolina, Greensboro 
and Dave Gutierrez of CS U San 
Bernardino. Treno shot a lowest 
score of the second round, a t wo-
under par 70 to bring hi two-
day total to 145, tying him for 
first place with Andrade. Gutier-
rez shot a 72 in the first round 
but finished in third place after 
two rounds with a 77.
