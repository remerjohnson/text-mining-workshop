Presented with a five-point charge from 
Acting Chancellor York, the Advisory 
Committee on Police-Student Relations last 
week began their investigation of ways to ease 
tensions between law enforcement agencies 
and students. The committee immediately 
attempted to explore the possibilities of 
providing legal assistance to students in 
trouble with the law. 

Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs George 
Murphy, committee co-chairman along with 
student Nick Aguilar, presented the 24 
members with the charge from the Chancellor 
at the body 's first meeting Tuesday evening. 
The Chancellor instructed the advisory 
committee to explore ways " to improve 
relationships between students and the 
campus and San Diego police ; to make the 
campus police department a more integral 
part of the campus community ; to develop 
effective mechanisms for handling complaints 
inv?lving students and police officers, 
whichever party is the complainant; and to 
provide students with necessary and possible 
levels of legal counsel and assistance in 
protecting their rights as citizens. " The 
committee was given broad discretion in its 
functions, in that the Chancellor also 
instructed it to seek ways " to resolve such 
other issues involving students and police as 
may, in your judgment. require attention." 

Open to Public 
After deciding that until further notice all 

committee meetings will be open to the public. 
the stUdent-administration committee decided 
on the areas on which they will initially focus. 
The committee decided that they wi\1 
concentrate for the present on the problems of 
files maintained by the campus police and 
ways of providing legal assistance to student . 
The committee is scheduled to present its first 
report to the Chancellor tomorrow and it wi\1 
most likely deal with tbese-two issues.

considerable amount of time Tuesday 
discussing the problem of raising bail money 

for students when they are jailed. The 
committee was informed that although the

which is followed. An example was given of a 
student who was arrested in Riverside on a 
drunk driving charge a couple of weeks ago. 
Bail was set at $535, which the student could 
not afford to pay. Arrangements bad been 
made througb the Financial Aids Office. with 
Vice-Chancellor Murphy's assistance, for the 
student to get an advance on his financial aids 
money which would pay for his spring tuition. 
It was pointed out that this was a special 
situation which might not be possible in other 
cases. 

"Universal" Assistance Opposed 
While most committee members agreed 

that there was a need to find some way of 
obtaining bail money for students who are 
arrested, there was some resistance to 
providing assistance in all cases. One 
committee member said " there are some 
things bail should be provided for and some 
things it should not. " The person said that he 
didn 't think the University should provide bail 
money to someone arrested for drunk driving 
since "someone who is driving while he is 
drunk can kill someone." Other members 
pointed out that it is important to remember 
that "everyone is innocent until proven 
guilty." Pointing out that bail is a 
constitutional right. one member said that 
" we can 't be in the position of deciding which 
cases we wi\1 assist with and which we won 't. ,. 

It was pointed out that 10 ome cases 
persons are released from jail on their "own

-The Chancellor's Advisory Committee on 
Police-Student Relations will meet today at 
4:30p.m. in Conference Room 506 Mat-
thews campus. All committee meetings are 
open to the public. 

A number of students at UCSD have 
brought to my attention a situation 
which I view with grave concern. The 
situation is not easy to describe. for it 
is composed of many elements. As 
perceived by these students, however, 
the most important element is an 
increase in the number and seriousness 
of their en~unters with law 
enforcement officials. â€¢ 

There is a history of strained 
relations between students and police 
across this ation which has been 
amply documented. Our own campus 
community has had intimate 
experience with these problems. But a 
new element has arisen that 
complicates the matter further . The 
Republican National Convention is 
scheduled for San Diego in August. 
1972. Some members of the San Diego 
community view UCSD with alarm and 
have sought to promote the notion that 
we will provide a sanctuary for 
revolutionaries bent on violent 
disruption of the convention. The 
notion is false but it persists. Its 
persistence leads to the belief by many 
that a nationwide network of law 
enforcement and related agencies 
seeks to " Neutralize" imagined as 
well as real threats to the convention. 
and that the focus of this 
.. eutralization" i this campus and 
es peciall y Third College . 
(Parenthetically. I want to state 
clearly and unequivocally that the 

CSD administration has no direct 
knowledge of any such network or 
objective. I 

Against this background . any 
changes in the nature and extent of 
police tudent encounters 
automatically b come highly vi ible. 
We are aware. for exampJ . of 
increased fteld interrogation

hitchhiking. a a result. pre umatl.v. of 
the orth Countv murder la t 
summer How ver. the perceptIOn and 
under tanding of thi activity by our 
tudEmt may be v ry differ nt from 

that of the authorities and the general 
public because of the situation I have 
described. 

Recently the situation deteriorated 
further when three black students 
were arrested in Pacific Beach on 
suspicion of armed robbery and 
subsequently jailed. Charges were 
never filed and the students were 
released 40 hour, later. but the arrests 
remain a mattcr of public record. In 
the same week, a La Jolla resident. not 
a student and not black . was observed 
several times destroying posters on 
our campus. She was not arrested and 
we have not yet been able to move 
effectively against this sort of 
harrassment. But reasons aside. it is 
no wonder that students question our 
assertions about the impartiality of 
justice. 

Because of these and other ca es. 
there is a rapidly growing mistrust of 
law enforcement agencies and Olher 
bureaucracies both on and off campus 
on the part of our students, especially 
minority students and students with 
new and different liIe-styles . It is this 
growing mistrustwhich I view with the 
most erious concern. I am committed 
to taking whatever steps I can in 
dealing with the basis for this 
mistrust. 

A a fir t step, I believe it is 
es entia I that the legitimate function . 
procedures. and constraints which 
apply to the UC D Police Department 
be c\ arly under too<l by tudent and 
admini trators alike. J further feel 
that it is neces ary for students and 
police to become b tter - acquamted 
per onally 0 that our police forc(' Will 
be corr tly vi w d a an mtegral part 
of our ampu commumty. rather than 
a orne rt of agent of out id forct:. 

Th matter of police record ha

understandtng. I believe we should 
move as rapidly and as completely as 
possible to make available to each 
concerned student the information 
those files contain about him. and the 
use to which that information is put. A 
number of other matters relating to 
the UCSD Police Department should 
similarly be addre sed. 

As a second step, the relationships 
between UCSD and the San Diego 
Police Department should be 
explained in considerable detail. Of 
particular concern is the degree of 
jurisdiction which that department 
exercises over the campus. and the 
understandings and agreements which 
have developed over the years in 
connection with that jurisdiction. 
These arrangement have been 
negotiated for the specific purpose of 
protecting the rights of student and 
others of the campus community. as 
well as the responsibility of the 
campus to conduct its own affairs. I 
believe the arrangements are good 
ones and that they have protected 
tudent . I also believe they need to be 

reviewed in detail in order to make 
certain that this is till so. 

The issue of campus police carrying 
guns has ari en again. I hall 
personally study this issue with an

Students give housing views 

. A r~cent report ~as concluded that the San Diego housing 
situation should be unproved to better " integrate the student 
and the University population into the community." 

Last April, three UCSD students, Jim Magill, Jeff Benjamin, 
and Tom Shepard, sent out a questioMaire to 1150 students in 
the area to determine what the housing situation was both on 
and off campus. This report was financed with $300 from the 
Associated Student Council, $50 from the Sociology 
Department and $600 from the Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affairs. 

The questioMaire asked students to evaluate the present 
housing situation and indicate how they would like it to be 
imprOVed. The results were tabulated by a computer and 
analyzed to try and develop "a uniquely student-oriented plan 
for the development of the University community." 

The report is entitled, "Student Community Planning 
Project" and addresses itself primarily to the Master Plan for 
San Diego, which is supposed to determine future construction 
in the area. 

Some of the conclusions of the report were : 1) the 
" traditional" student is satisfied with the dorms on campus 
while the more " liberated" student is not satisfied ; 2) the 
apartments at Muir have not met all the needs of their 
residents ; 3) University rents are outrageously high ; 4) 
students do not want crowded city dwellings , rather they would 
prefer to live in a country " Walden scene'; 5) the Master Plan, 
developed by the San Diego City Council in 1959. must be 
updated ; 6 ) students can 't afford to live in highÂ·priced 
apartments. 

The report concluded by urging San Diego to give more 
" thought to unique student needs" in the development of an 
effective housing program for the community." 

Third World tutors needed 
There exists a program which offers 4 units of course credit 

for tutoring minority students at San Diego High School. 
Minority students at UCSD are encouraged to attend the 
November 30th information session at Tioga Hall (Muir 
dorms) lltb floor at 7:30 PM. 

Over 60 per cent of tbe total student body at San Diego High 
School is black, brown, asian, or native american. Tbis school 
needs tutorial assistance, especially from students wbo are bi-
lingual. Therefore, if you feel competent ID tbe following six 
areas please attend the tbe November 30 session: ENGLISH, 
SCIENCE, MATH, HISTORY, SPANISH, and ENGLISH AS A 
SECOND LANGUAGE.

Kaufman: After the first 90 days 
Molly Salvin 

In a recent interview AS 
President Paul Kaufman 
indicated his administration is 
most concerned a t present wi th 
the maintenance of the coast 
Cruiser bus and with bettering 
student-police relations. 

With the end of the first 
quarter approaching, it might 
be worthwhile to examine the 
present student government, 
or, more specifically, AS 
President Paul Kaufman, in 
light of last springs' campaign 
platforms. 

Kaufman and Tom Caryl, AS 
Vice President, advocated 
primarily the establishment of 
a student corporation , 
financially independent of the 
University ; the establishment 
of an AS record store, 
laundromat , food store , 
bookstore , and student 
discounts at other local 
businesses. They pledged tl! 
maintain operation of the Coast 
Cruiser ; to seek easy access to 
Black 's Beach ; to expedite 
construction of the Student 
Center (to be built in the 
vicinity of the new 
International Center) ; to stage 
a "big name" concert at the 
Sports Arena to raise money ; 
to put students on important 
decisionÂ·making committees 
on campus; and to establish a 
student administrative 
assistant to work with the 
campus administration. 

Just how far have tlrese 
projects progressed by the 
beginning of December? 

The coast Cruiser has been in 
operation for nearly a year 
now, and according to 
Kaufman , it's customers really 
jepend on the service . 
However, the bus is generally 
only half-filled and financially, 
is not solvent. Operating funds 
have previously come from the 
AS but Kaufman is now 
attempting to secure new 
means of funding and more 
customers . 

Kaufman would like to 
purchase a London double-
decker bus directly from 
London and to subsidize it with 
$19,000 in funds from the 
University of California, the 
city of San Diego and from Gulf 
General Atomic Corporation. 
He feels the "psychological 
appeal" of a London doubleÂ· 
decker bus will be great enough 
to lure hitchhikers and car 
commuters into riding this new 
Coast Cruiser . Once people 
break their carÂ·riding habits , 
Kaufman feels , they will be 
more likely to sell their 
parking permits and /or their 
cars and become regular 
customers. The secret of 
success , according to 
Kaufman, is to operate the bus 
long enough and regularly 
enought to have poople be able 
to depend on it for service. " It 
must be made attractive 
enoughÂ·' he said. 

The $19,000 in funds would be 
enough to buy the bus ($5,000) 
and to operate it for a year 
($14 .000 ), Kaufman is presently 
attempting to get $13,000 from 

the University, specifically 
from President Charles Hitch's 
discretionary funds, with the 
remaining funds to come from 
local businesses and 
governments. 

To avert long repair delays, 
the bus will be ordered from 
London complete with the 
spare parts most likely to 
break down most often. 

Additionally , at some future 
date, the bus will be converted 
from diesel to propane to help 
reduce exhaust emmissions. 
. The new bus will need 
approximately 'h to 213 
occupancy plus a small subsidy 
to keep it solvent after its 
initial year of operation. 
Kaufman felt this money might 
be forthcoming from tbe City 
of Del Mar since it would like 
to see commuter traffic 
reduced. 

The present single-decker 
Coast Cruiser is rented from 
the Central Garage on campus 
and is operated by Mike 
" Heavy" Palcie, last year 's AS 
President. 

Renewed tensions between 
students and police, notably the 
arrest and subsequent release 

of Ken Carr, Herb Bradley and 
Paul Simms, have motivated 
Kaufman to seek greater 
protection for students and a 
better understanding wi th the 
police. 

Kaufman is presently 
considering AS membership in 
the Center for Legal and Social 
Services. The Center provides 
each member with a wallet-
sized card listing citizen's 
rights when arrested and 
contains two dimes for the two 
phone calls j)ermitted 
arrested persons. The member 
is to call the Center with one of 
the dimes and one of the staff 
lawyers will attempt to raise 
bail if one has been set. The 
member is then permitted one 
free visit from a Center 
Lawyer. Succeeding visits are 
a t a lower than usual price with 
flexible payment 
arrangements. 

Center memberships are 
normally $10 per person, 
however Kaufman says the AS 
hllS negotiated a special group 
membership rate for AS 
members of $2 per person. 

Kaufman calls the Center 
" legallnsurance for students". 
He feels Center membership 

"potentially" could have 
helped obtain earlier release 
for Carr, Simms, and Bradley. 

The center is "relatively 
small now" according to 
Kaufman, but it has a good 
reputation. Additionally, he 
feels that the Center's 
reputation will grow even more 
if the AS becomes a member. 

Kaufman also h3!l plans to 
initiate seminars on the 
student-police problem. These 
seminars will inform students 
of tbeir rights visÂ·a-vis the 
police and discuss current 
problems. 

Kaufman claims he is still 
" looking into a corporation" 
but that he has "let it go for 
awhile". He sees the need for 
an independent student 
corporation because of 
restrictions the UC Regents 
have imposed on the use of AS 
money . An additional 
independent source such as a 
corporation would provide 
funds for political causes and to 
more fully support the UC 
lobby program in Sacramento.

U(SD prof gets Royal post 
Dr. E. Margaret Burbidge. Professor of 

Astronomy. at UCSD. has been appointed 
director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory , 
Herstmonceux Castle. Hailsham, Sussex. 
England . 

Dr. Burbidge succeeds Sir Richard Woolley , 
who is retiring after serving as director since 
1955. 

Dr. Burbidge is the first woman to be named 
to the prestigious post in the 300-year history 
of the observatory. Originally founded to 
provide accurate measurement of time, 
necessary for navigation, the observatory was 
moved several years ago from its former site 
on the meridian of Greenwich, and a new 98-
inch Isaac Newton telescope was set up at the 
new site. As director . Dr. Burbidge's main 
concern will be to improve the situation in 
optical observational astronomy in Britain . 
which. because of the climate and sky quality . 
can be done with full effectiveness only from 
overseas sites. A new 159Â·inch telescope is at 
present being built cooperatively by Britain 
and Australia and will be set up in Siding 
Spring, Australia, and it is hoped that' a new 
major observatory with large telescopes will 
be set up at a good location in the Northern 
Hemisphere. 

UC Connections Retained 
Dr. Burbidge is the wife of Dr. Geoffrey R. 

Burbidge. Professor of Physics at UCSD. Both 
joined the UCSD faculty in 1962. DR 
Brubidge will take up her appointment in the 
summer of 1972 on a leave of absence. She 
plans to retain her connections with the 
University of California and will continue 
research work now under way with the 
astrophysics group at UCSD. Dr. Geoffrey 
Burbidge plans to divide his time between the 
United States and the United Kingdom . 

The Burbidges are worldÂ· renowned for their 
astrophysical research in many fields, 
including the chemical compositions or stars. 
nuclear astrophysics and extragalactic 
astronomy. 

Dr. Burbidge has written more than 200 
papers for scientific journals. most of them in 
collaboration with her husband . She is the 

author of or contributor to several textbooks in 
her field, and author of the article on Nebula 
for Encyclopaedia Britannica. Dr. Burbidge 
has delivered numerous papers and lectures at 
universities, congresses and symposia 
throughout the world. 

From 1948 to 1951, Dr. Burbidge served as 
assistant director and later acting director of 
the London Observatory. She was a research 
fellow at Yerkes Observatory in 1951Â·53 and a 
research fellow at California Institute of 
Technology from 1955Â·57. From 1957Â·58 she 
served as a Shirley Farr Research Fellow at 
the Yerkes Observatory, and was later a 
research associate and associate professor 
there. During her years at the University of 

, Chicago she was also a member of the Enrico 
Fermi Institute for Nuclear studies. She went 
to UCSD in 1962 as an associate physicist. 

The Burbidges reside in La Jolla , California . 
They have one daughter, Sarah, age 15, who is 
a student at La Jolla High School. 

In order to test for math 81ld Â·Iogic skills a bi-lingual entrance 
exam is administered. The introductory course material is also 
bi-Iingual so it is not absolutely necessary to be English 
speaking. Although qualifications for entry into the training 
program seem rigid, CJTT has made it their policy to accept 
those who seriously claim they want to be programmers. The 
first few weeks prove to be the real entrance exam as students 
who find it too difficult drop-out. 

The student in the CJTT program learns through practically 
using learning material. Even on the first day after a brief 
introduction, the student writes a simple program. 

CJTT has been most successful in getting students back in 
San Diego area colleges and junior colleges to further their 
computer training. Job placement has been poor but the 
program has been "a vehicle for getting people excited and 
turned-on," describes Dr. Granger Morgan, program director . 

In addition to adult classes, CJTT has run special 
motiviational classes for credit at Lincoln and Morris Junior 
High summer sessions. 

Like most developing programs CJTT has had serious 
financial problems. They have resorted to substituting " labor 
for capitaL" Highly trained programmers and Ph .D,'s have 
been employed as carpenters and painters. Some of the 
material used for building up the van was found in old buildingsÂ· 
and construction sites ; one badly needed power pole was taken 
from Matthews Campus. Morgan claims that you can't develop 
a program using these techniques. Many of those involved 
believe that if the money hadn't come in "spurts" the success 
of the program would have doubled. Up to now the success of 
the program according to Dr. Morgan is due to its staffing and 
professionalism. Norman Down, an instructor, said that 
without the undergraduate help it couldn't have become what it 
is . The professionalism is said to have set this program apart 

ob program â€¢ from others of its kind . Dr. Morgan describes the average kid C t Â· as having little understanding of a programmers life style. He on In u e s feels that understanding life styles is an important ingredient 
despite financial woes

Computer Jobs Through Training is a joint project of the 

UCSD Department of Applied Physics and Information 
Science, the Computer Center, and the Office of University 
Extension. It provides training for disadvantaged individuals 
from the San Diego area in semi-technical and business 
computer programming. 

The most unique feature about this program is that the 
training is done in a forty foot trailer truck. The trailer truck 
was donated by Safeway Foodstores in 1969 and serves as a 
mobile classroom. A training facility was constructed in the 
van with help from the Rosenberg Foundation of San 
Francisco, Montgomery Ward and the University. The mobile 
instructional facility is the most economical means of reaching 
the many spread-out. low income communities in San Diego. 

Computer programming has been labeled as a "High entry 
level" job. With Computer Jobs Through Training a 
disadvantaged young adult can be trained for a more exciting 
career than found in the low entry level jobs. The founders of 
Computer Jobs Through Training (CJTT) recognized that 
educational inequalities exist and therefore devised a program

Robert Cooney and Roger Ruffin 

Judges iudge iustice 
Joni Garwood 

"Criminal law is the core of 
the legal system . 
Unfortunately. most judges are 
not experienced or competent 
in criminal justice." 

Such was the statement 
made by Roger Ruffin , 
Superior Court judge for San 
Diego County. Ruffin . who 
resigned two months ago, was 
guest speaker with Municipal 
Court judge Robert Cooney for 
a Contemporary Issues class 
last week. 

Ruffin 's comment stemmed 
from his own experience. 
"When I assumed the bench ten 
years ago, I knew nothing about 
cr iminal law and I wasn 't 
prepared to handle a criminal 
case. It took me about one year 
before I was able to evaluate in 
a judicial sense the humane. 
just. and decent aspect of the 
situation. 

.. However. one gauges the 
worth of our judicial system by 
the way it handles the criminal. 
The treatment of the accused 
and the punishment be receives 
if convicted must be conducted 
in an openÂ·minded and rational 
manner. Therefore it is 
damaging for both the cou rt 
and the individual citizen when 
a judge is crippled by his own 
inexperience ... 

Both Cooney and Ruffm 
expressed concern over the 
backlog of casesl which flood 
the courts. In the Municipal 
Court. procedures for traffic 
violations are prolongec and 
time consuming. 

In 1968, possession of drugs 
changed from a mi demeanor 
to a felony . Since then, the 
Superior Court has been faced 
with an overÂ·abundance of drug 

cases . Ruffin , who is 
"pessimistic about the court's 
ability to handle the load." 
remarked. "The hysteria and 
irrationality which pervades 
the subject IS entirely out of 
proportion in respect to other 
crimes. The citizen should be 
protected . but too much time is 
being lavished on the detection 
and enforcement of the drug 
law. The legislature should 
legalize it or find some other 
alternative which will relieve 
the courts." 

Cooney also believes that the 
tremendous amount of drug 
arrests injures the court and 
the person convicted . While he 
personally feels that "drugs 
are a cop-out. a felony on one 's 
record severely inhibits future 
security and happiness . 
However. despite the worth of 
the law, the judiciary system 
and law enforcement agencies 
must uphold the statute 
regardless of their opinion." 

Although both men find 
weaknesses in the system. they 
equally admire the Supreme 
Court of California. The Court 
was labeled "a progressive 
court consistmg of truly 
scholarly and intelligent men 
with regard to the law" by 
Ruffin . Cooney added that " the 
men apPOinted are all 
extremely dedicated .Â·' ThiS 
superiority and judicial 
impartiality also manifest 
itself in lower courts . 
accord mg to Cooney. .. The 
majority of judges in California 

-have abstained from political 
activity once they assumed the 
bench . This provides a 
continuity in justice." said 
Cooney. 

Sickle cell anemia 
center planned 

The Black Action Committee feels that an adequate sickle 
cell anemia center is needed In San Diego. In order to establish 
this center. they are soliciting funds from the community of 
San Diego in the amount of $500 . 

A Sickle Cell Anemia Business Office has recently been 
opened by BAC. Located at 2654 Imperial Ave. in San Diego, 
the office is involved with dlspensing information about the 
disease and with implementing programs to test and treat 
people. The office is generally open from 4 to 8 p.m. daily and 
can be reached by telephone at 233-8883. According to BAC 
President Bernard Ashcraft,the Sickle Cell Office "needs 
office supplies," and will welcome donations. 

Sickle Cell anemia is possibly the most prevalent genetic 
disease in the world today. In America it has been estimated to 
affect 50.000 Black peop e, while over two million others carry 
the sickle cell trait. BAC finds he present allocations from the 
Federal government ina,lequate to meet the needs of research 
and treatment of this distase. 

Present day treatment of sickle cell anemia is still entirely 
symptomatic. 1 Inm " " IT" lr n" -!,' . Jr." r"!' Oil jlreventive

George McGo.vern 
for President 

by Kathy Welch 
UCSD Students for McGovern 

"But the fact is of all of my colleagues in the United States 
Senate. the person who has the most feeling and does things in 
the most genuine way. without that affecting his life, is George 
McGovern. He is so highly admired by all his colleagues, not 
just for his ability but because of the kind of man that he is 
That is truer of him than anvone else in the United States 
Senate." -

Senator Robert F. Kennedy, May 10.1968 

George McGovern is a man who has sponsored or 
consponsored every major piece of civil rights legislation since 
1963 ; has led in Senate efforts to improve the proposed Family 
Assistance' .Plan : and has spoken out with more authority 
against the war in Indochina than any other person in the U.S. 
Congress. 

In September of 1963, Senator McGovern m-SOuth Dakota) 
had this to say about Vietnam : "The failure in Vietnam will not 
remain confined to Vietnam. The trap we have fallen into 
there will baunt us in every corner of this revolutionary 
world ... " 

WlIo's 08 tbe IJaDdwagoD? 

When comparing his policy on this subject with those of other 
presidenlial candidates, it becomes quite clear just who has 
jumped on the bandwagon in recent years. Senators Muskie , 
Humphrey, Jackson, and Harris all supported President 
Johnson's war policy, which became the adopted majority 
plank at the 1968 Democratic Convention. 

Out of the above-mentioned presi.dential aspirants, George 
McGovern was the only one who voted for each of the three 
Hatfield Amendments which called for abolishment of the 
draft in favor of an all-volunteer army. The former university 
professor also voted for the Proxmire Amendment, which 
would have reduced expenditures for the SST from $280 million 
to $80 million 11966 l. Once again , Senators Muskie, Humphrey, 
and the rest of the lot went along with President Johnson's 
opposition to the Amendment. 

Ironically it is no wonder that the NEW YORK TIMES came 

out with aD UDOfflci.al endonemeat of lIcGovera wilen tbe 
newtpaper .. id, "His record speaks 10 powerfully in his 
behalf. He bas never been afraid to speak out or to stand 
aloDe." 

1brougbout his entire congressional career, Senator 
McGovern has been one of the outspoken proponents of 
COIIIIftVation. Among the bills wbich be bas offered are those 
concernilli the Great Plains Conservation Program, the Great 
Prairie Lakes Waterway, and a comprehensive proposal for a 
national policy on conservation. 

SpoaIOl' of Emroameatal BUll 
In the environmental area he is a principal sponsor of a 

pending bill which would give individuals tbe right to bring 
action in Federal court against polluters. In addition, he has 
co-sponsored all major environmental protection laws and is 
an advocate of a world environmental institute. 

The Ph.D. bolder (history) has also proposed a $31 million 
military cut which would be fed into civilian~riented projects 
such as child-<:are centers, health centers , education, etc. 
Futhermore, the presidential office-seeker has sponsored 
several bills for improving conditions in rural America in 
order to discourage the continued emigration toward already-
overcrowded regions. 

While working in President Kennedy's administration as the 
firs! director of the Food for Peace Program, McGovern 
developed basic legislation converting the program from a 

IUI'pIuJ diIpoIal plan to poIltive production to meet world food 
aeecb. Thillaw, for a broadened world food effort, pasaed the 
CoIIIIftS in 1966. 

Directly concerned with international education, the South 
Dakota junior senator was the chief sponsor of a bill to 
establish academic programs on foreign development. 

"PraetleaUy bstnImntal" 
Brieny, as a final summation concerning his mOlt profound 

legislative efforts to date, Senator McGovern has been 
practically instrumental in proposing bills in behalf of the 
American Indian, the 18-year~ld voter, and the longest 
oppressed group - women. 

While chairing the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, 
McGovern co-sponsored legislation for c1airfying Indians' tax 
status, loan guarantees. school construction, and pilot 
programs. He has been active on behalf of the Sioux tribes and 
strongly supported the return of the Blue Lake to the Taos 
pueblo . 

Regarding constitutional matters, the junior senator has co-
sponsored the major Constitutional amendments proposed in 
recent years : presidential succession . direct election of the 
president, and the 18-year~ld vote. He has fought for the equal 
rigbts amendment for women from his earliest yea,=s in the 
House. 

Finally, the inevitable question comes up - "Can be win?" 
The answer is YES. McGovern has gained in recent months of 
volunteer support and success in the polls, by leaps and bounds. 
In a poll published this past week in the SAN DIEGO UNION, 
McGovern held down the third spot behind President Nixon and 
Edmund Muskie. Incidentally, Muskie, who up until now has 
been labeled the Democratic Party frontrunner, has suffered 
crucial losses of strength in the national polls. A strong 
sentiment within the McGovern camp is that its candidate will 
soon be overtaking the position that Senator Muskie supposedly 
holds on the 1972 nomination. With McGovern snapping on the 
heels of Muskie. there is strong justification for such ideology. 

"Overwbelmiqly WiDDiog" 
A recent poll published in TIle New Democrat, whose editor 

is Stephen Schlesinger (son of historian Arthur Schlesinger, 
Jr .) showed McGovern overwhelmingly winning the poll by 
salvaging almost 30 per cent of the vote in the nine-man field . 

This brings us to one of the more frequent questions asked 
concerning Senator McGovern's candidaacy' "He is too youth-
oriented, and therefore. how can ge gather support among the 
'middle-of-the-road' voter?" To this one can only point out that 
McGovern was elected to public office from South Dakota - a 
farm state. How many liberal farmers do you know? 

As Senator McGovern, himself, once so eloquently offered, 
"The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, 
they seek a way out of the wilderness. But if we who seek their 
trust, trust them, if we try to evoke the 'better angels ' of our 
nature, the people will find their own way. We are children of 
those who built a great and free nation. And we are no less than 
that. We must not decide whether our courage and imagination 
are equal to our talents. If they are, as I believe, then future 
generations will continue to love America , not simply because 
it is theirs. but for what it has become - for what, indeed, we 
ba ve made it. " 

G d th A I bulb is on, when in fact it isn 't. causes reading O e noma Ydifficulties . True. and this is an objective question. His implication was that if happiness results from believing in Jesus. then Jesus The Word is Abroad in the Land Again by Jim Sill b y Jude F awrley caused it . This is not so, for two reasons. First. 
"The fact that it is possible to push a pea up a 

mountain with your nose does fIot mean that this 
is the sensible way of getting it it there. " 

Chrlstopher Stracl)ey 
â€¢ 

God is an anomaly in his own universe. Even if 

the statement is subjective. i.e., its truth cannot 
be tested. If I believe I am happy. it is not subject 
to question. for there is no way to test the truth of 
it. It is the act of believing myself happy that 
makes it so'. Thus for a subjective question such 
as thi~ . believing makes it true ; but for objective 
quesllons. no amount of believing will produce 
light. or make a heart attack go away.

coherent a system. Where astra-phy ics leaves Jesus has no monopoly. I suggest that the

off. biological evolution begins. There are 
certainly gaps in the body of sCience which 
derives man and his Intelligence from inorganic 
cosmic molecules. but this rl!f1ects the 
incompleteness of man 's observations. not the 
violability of the underlying laws. We tru t the e 
laws deeply - we know the sun will rise

physical laws are inVIOlate and eternal. and that 
no existing entity can change them. ThiS trust IS a

common denominator amongst mankind 's happy 
people is a confident belief and a deep

" Repression "-th.e word is 
abroad in the land again. 
Several minority and Third 
College students have charged 
the University and the San 
Diego police with various 
maneuvers designed to breed 
fear . Specifically, those 
students are concerned about 
undercover agents , 
harrassment. and 
intimidatIOn. 

Two prox imate causus belli 
seem to have triggered this 
ou tburst of entiments . The 
first concerned the ripping of a 
sign at Third College ; the 
seco nd the arrest a nd 
temporary detainment of three 
students by the Sa n Diego 
police. These incidents. at 
least. are cited by Ken Carr, 
the apparent leader of the 
protests. Let's examine these 
incidents and a Iitlle recent 
history of intimidation at 
UCSD. 

SignoR ipping 
The first incident involved 

the ripping of a sign. which 
action was allegedly carried 
out by a middle-aged La Jolla 
lady. Just what happened IS not 
completely clear. with sign-
paint r Carr claiming the lady 
deliberatelv LOre It. and she 
saying it was aCCidental. The 
aftermath saw mutual threats 
of civil SUitS . but the University 
police declined to pros cute 
either party. 1 saw the same 
si!!:n later that day. tap d up. 
still hangmg on a Third College 
Building. 

The Clip and the Bust

Page" Triton Tllnes Tuesday, November 30, 1971 

Carr was stopped by a San 
Diego police officer who 
thought Carr was speeding. The 
policeman sawÂ· a pistol on the 
seat next to Carr and decided 
further investigation was 
indicated . The pistol proved to 
be Carr 's dulY' registered 
possession. The rub, however, ' 
came in when the police 
discovered that Carr had a clip 
of ammunition in his coat 
pocket. State law requires that 
a gun and its ammunition not 
be carried together in a car, 
unless one of the two is in the 
trunk . the other in the 
passenger area. Carr and his 
two associates were taken 
downtown and held for almost 
48 yours. at the end of which 
period the police (having fou nd 
the gentlemen unwanted for 
any outstanding high crimes 
or misdemeanors I relea ed 
them . 

Certai nl y this was an 
inordinate length of time to 
hold them without a formal 
charge. On the other hand , the 
thre were not bereft of 
assistance . as several 
attorneys and nothing less than 
a former Supenor Court judge 
sought their release. Certainly 
I would be glad to have their 
assistance the next time I fight 
a traffic ticket! But. more to 
the point. Carr got a rather 
good break m nol bemg 
charged in the matter of the 
ammunitIOn and pistol bemg m 
the pas enger area. 

Danger.Packed 

ReVieWing . then. we find the 
crimes perpetrated by the cops 
against the hon 1 01 CSD 
students limited to th p r nal 

adversities of one Ken Carr. 
Somehow. one is less than 
impressed by his danger-
packed confrontation with a 
middle-aged lady from 
suburbia. Carr is not above a 
Iitlle coercion himself at times, 
as those who witnessed his 
shouting performance at the 
Communication Board meetmg 
last month will allest. Comm. 
Board vice-chairman Mike 
Weiss was quoted In the 
TRITON TIMES as saying he 
was " intimidated " by Carr. 

Repression 

In any case. this whole 
business of " repression " 
summons Up memories for this 
writer. I recall standing 'on 
Revelle Plaza in late spring a 
couple of yea rs ago listening to 

, 

a dynamic young Black student 
leader declaim the evil of " the 
fascist power structu re" and 
the imminence 01 
'Â· repression." Specifically. the 
spea ker con linued , the 
Administration was taking 
precautions to prevent build ing 
takeovers. 

The exact dale was May I . 
1969. The speaker was Angela 
Davis. Six days later, her 
followers broke into and 
occupied the Registrar's Office 
and demanded that the lacull~' 
senate approve the proposed 
new Third College pial! . The 
demand was, needless to say. 
agreed to. and the building-
occupiers given complete 
amnesty. 

" RepresslOn"- the word IS 
abroad 10 the land agam .

Basketball, Fencing 
and Finals Fobia 

The ca lendar this week is 
pretty sparse, due to the fact 
that it is near the end of the 
quarter ; most of the fall sports 
have ended their seasons ; the 
winter sports have yet to 
begin ; and the memesis of all 
students , finals . wi ll 
commence in one week. 

The varsity basketball team 
plays its first game against the 
highly unrated opponent , 
Pacific Christian, in what 
hopefully will be a suitable 
warm-up for the La Jolla 
Classic. The game will be 
played today, Tuesday, starling 
at 8 p.m. in the gym. Friday 
marks the opening of the La 
Jolla Classic, with the first 
game to be played at 6 p.m., 
with the home squad matched 

against Hayward State. This 
titanic match will be followed 
by a game pitting cross-town 
rival USIU against powerful 
San Francisco State, hopefully 
starting at8 p.m. 

Anyone interested in running 
for the intercollegiate track 
team next spring? A meeting 
has been tentatively scheduled 
for 5 p. m. Friday in the 
gymnasium classroom. For 
further information call the 
woman with all the answers, 
Maureen. at X227S. 

The fencing team has 
aranged a match for Saturday 
at 10 a.m. Scheduled to appear 
are those amazing Aztecs. 
from San Diego State. and the 
University of Ar izona. The 
match will be set in the gym. 

Exciting basketball action , much like in tbe picture, bigblites

TOIIIliIIcHIerg 

~ Diego's own Old Globe ter is working furiously to blish a seat with the 
vaocuard of comtemporary 
theater, and the present 
stagiJIg of Robert Shaw's "The 
Man in the Glass Booth" is 
hardly an elception to the 
cause. The controversy of war 
crimes and justice seems to 
have run its course, or at least 
until the United States began 
puoisbing its own soldiers; and 
now Shaw reminds us that this 
is one argument that was never 
solved. 

Leonard Nimoy, the stellar 
Mr. Spock of "Star Trek," is 
now another pointed character, 
Albert Goldman, a 
tremendously successfu I 
Manhattan real estate tycoon. 
He is a strong-willed Jew 
exercising his right to illusions 
of grandeur, and he surrounds 
himself with elaborate bad 
taste in both interior 
decorations and emotions. He 

. cherishes the urn of ashes of 
his dead wife, sings, chuckles, 

people. He does not willi tD 
deny his arrocaace, but only 
accept his destiny under Hitler, 
and proclaims, "People of 
Israel, if he had chosen you, 
you too would have followed." 
This tactful ploy is only 
overlooked as a surprise 
witness reveals that the 
defendant is an impostor, not 
Dorff but actually Goldman, 
the Jew. Changing pace, he 
again protests that the Jews 
were no more noble in 
destroying Hitler and the 
defeated Nazis , and again he 
laments : "It is the living who 
are in neglect, what can we do 
about the living?" But the 
insulted court is only confused, 
and Goldman slumps ,dejected 
against the glass booth, a 
frustrated shadow of Christ. 

and screams, cultivates an 
apostle i., his young aid and is 
most of all remorseful, because 
he cannot divine both Christ 
and Hitler. 

His generosity is a burden 
and his tyranny merely 
disgusts his auociates. He 
laments the changing world 
("The Pope has forgiven the 
Jews. Jesus l ") and his own 
transformation ("Once, I was 
passionate! "), but he still holds 
tightly to his most daring 
achievement. Once, he says, he 
was Colonel Dorff of the Nazi 

Nimoy in "Glass Booth" 

Shaw's irony is heavy, 
almost overladen , but 
Goldman, the only character of 
any concern , is taught, 
questioning, and implausibly 
entertaining. He is a tragic 
figure of complex frustration, 
and Leonard Nimoy plays his 
demoniac madness with flavor , 
keeping the show within 
reason. Ben Shaktman directs 
with a good sense of the irony, 
and although the production 
does drag somewhat through 
the first act, the questions do 
get raised. Justice, Shaw says, 
is an improbable goal, and 
violence is an unlikely 
alternative. These intangibles 
seem to be only more prevalent 
today, and the good-evil 
embodiment of Goldman is a 
popular guise. "The Man in the 
G la ss Booth, " despi te its 
lapses, succeeds in asking why. 

Mobile Killing Unit, and once 
he enjoyed efficiently 
exterminating Jews. After 20 
years the Israeli government 
has tracked this enemy to his 
Manhattan stronghold and 
forces him back to stand trial 
for the unpardonable crimes 
that he so enjoyed. 

Once in Israel Goldman 
insists on defending himself, 
and dressed in his ss uniform, 
on display in the protective 
glass booth, he harangues the 
courtroom, glorifying Nazi 
Germany . He loved his 
Fuehrer and the precision with 
which he eliminated an inferior

Pave 6 Triton Times Tuesday, November 30, 1971 

In 1961, five young men from Hawthorne, Calif. got together, 
wrote a song about their favorite sport, "Surf in . " and rocked 
the country with their new sound , a cross section of Chuck 
Berry and The Four Freshmen. The group called themselves 
the Beach Boys. and little did anyone know the group would 
astound the world with albums, tours and awards, starting with 
their first album in 1962, "Surfin ' Safari," "Pet Sounds," and 
many others ; be voted No. I and No. 2 group in the, world in 
1966 and 1969, respectively ; and be the first American rock 
group to perform behind the Iron Curtain. The Beach Boys 
consist of Carl Wilson (lead guitar) , Dennis Wilson (drums ), 
Brian Wilson (Moog ), Alan Jardine (rhythm guitar ), Mike 
Love (vocals) and Bruce Johnston (bass & keyboards ). 
They've had ups and downs, changes in record companies, 
problems with the draft board : but through it all they have a 
new album, "Surf's Up, " and the distinction' of being the 
biggest selling American group in record history. They are 
accepted by true music fans . They've been rediscovered. They 
are harmonic in their sounds and maybe the inspiration for 
CSN&Y. 

Seatrain has come quite a way since its inception three years 
ago. The group is now headed bv Andy Kulberg (bass & flute ) 
with Peter Rowan (guitar & vocals ), Lloyd Baskin (keyboard & 
vocals\, Larry Atamanuik (drums ) and Dick Greene (violin ). 
They are the type of musicians who appeal to all age groups 
and all types of fans because of their simple, tightly woven 
sounds of country-western . blues and rock. They have a new 
album out under their group name. "Seatrain." 

Elvin Bishop evokes togetherness. It is a group of highly 
talented musicians who play blues. rhythm & blues. and rock . 
They are Elvin Bishop Iguitar\. Joe Baker Ivocals ). Stephen 
Miller (organ & vocals l. Kip Maercklein (bass \. John 
Chambers (drums ). and Perry Welsh (vocalsl. Their music 
speaks and the audience answers with clapping hands. 
stomping feet and singing voices. Elvin Bishop makes people 
feel music. 

Tickets are $4 .75 in advance and $5.00 at the door and are 
available at Bill Gambles, Central Ticket Agencies and the 
Sports Arena Box Office (224-41761 . Military discounts also

Officially recognized as a 
student organization this year, 
with a ratified club constitution 
and faculty advisor, Tom 
McCorry, the Drama Club is 
here to provide an important 
service. Its purpose is two-

fold : 1) to support and 
perpetuate, naturally, the high 
ideals, goals and quality of 

good dramatics ; and 2 ) (more 
important still ) to serve as a 
receptacle for new technical 
innovations and free 
expression. The Drama Club is 
here to provide the UCSD 
community their chance to 
express the way they feel, 
think, act and believe. 

What is more, the members 
of the club are concerned with 
the academic institutions of 
today that emphasize too 
heavily the importance of 
science and technology. In 
addition , they believe that art 
is also an essential part in the 
development of the whole 
person.

the AS is now considering, the Center would be paid 
approximately $10,000 to provide coverage for all UCSD

before that date. 

Independ~ntly of that mechanism, my concern about the 
total SituatIOn compels me to take further steps at this time. I 
am askIng Vice-Chancellor Murphy and Chief Torrens to 
receive rep~rts of student-~olice interactions and to study the 
other speCifiC concerns outlIned at the meetings in my office on 
Friday morning. Nov. 12, and in Conference Room A on

immediately. Among these I would hope to find a better 
mechanism for keeping me informed about police-student 
problems, ways of establishing better working relationships 
between students and tne UCSD Police Department. and 
means by. which the .campus might act to protect the rights of 
students Involved With the law. Such actions as might result 
fror:" these recommendations would be subject to further 
revl.ew by the advisory committee, but they would allow us to 
begIn to deal directly with the problems which have been 
identified without having to wait for the results of the detailed 
studies the committee would undertake.
