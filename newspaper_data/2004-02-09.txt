Athletics office to 
remain elected 

Amendment defeated, 16-7 
By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The .S. commissioner of 
athletic relations will remain an 
elected position after the failure 
of a constirutional amendment 
intended to make the office 
appointed by the ... Pre ident 
and confirmed by the senate. 

An open roll-call vote on the 
item ended on Feb. 6 with a vote 
of 16-7-0. As a con tirutional 
amendment, the legi lation 
required three-~ urth of the en-
ator ' approval to pa . 

Commissioner of Athletic 
Relations Jordan Cro s, who 
;pon ored the amendment, was 
:Iisappointed that it failed to win 
approval. 

"It's omewhat disappoint-
ing," Cross said. "It adden me 
to ee the lack of foresight that 
member of A:S. [ ouncil] seem 
to have." 

Cross and other coun-
cilmembers, like Thurgood 
Marshall College Sophomore 
Senator Kate PilIon, argued that 
since commissioners perform 
specific duties, they should be 
appoin ted to ensure that the 
most qua lifi ed in dividual wi ll 
hold the post. 

"Commissioners don't really 
act as representatives of the stu-

dents - they do a job, they do a 
ervice, they perform a ta k for 

the tudents," Pillon said. "To 
best erve the tudent , the 
[Councill hould appoint com-
missioners because we'll get the 
be t and mo t qualified person in 
that position." 

Council members who 
opposed the ' change in the 
election method pointed to a 

• pring 2003 referendum that 
asked students to approve mak-
ing all the commissioners 
appointed. The amendment 
failed with 51 percent of voter 
ca ting "no" ballots and 2 per-
cent voting "yes." 

John Muir College 
ophomore Senator Nam Bui 

voted against appointing the 
commissioner of athletics 
because of last year's referen-
dum. 

"The srudents spoke ju t last 
year," Bui aid. "I value the voice 
of the students." 

Supporters of the legislation, 
however, called the referendum 
biased and pointed to a lack of 
voter education surrounding the 
ballot question. 

"I don't thin k there was any 
debate or discussion on the ref-
erendum itse lf," Eleanor

Freshmen 
to retain 
parking 

next year 
Decision 

deferred until 
Fall 2005 
By WINNIE CHAN 

Staff Writer 

T he Transportation and 
Parking Committee has decided to 
defer any deci ion to restrict fresh-
man parking until Fall 2005 . 
Parking will remain available to 
freshmen for tlle 2004-05 academ-
ic year. 

"Last year we were looking at a 
big parking crunch," TPC faculty 
chair Daniel Arovas said. "We 
decided not to restrict freshman 
parking outright and [instead] 
formed a ubcommittee that met 
over the summer." 

T he work 'group met over the 
summer to discuss and recom-
mend ways the wliver ity could 
implement limiting freshman resi-
dent parking for Fa ll 2004 and 
reported on the recommendations 
at the first TP meeting on Jan. 
27. 

"During the SUl11mer, it became 
apljarent that this new poli y 
might be able to be delayed anoth-
er year due to delayed construction

New Student Center 
concepts presented 

Two courtyards proposed 
By GAlLLE FAURE 

News Editor 

The architectural firm hired 
to renovate and expand Student 
Center presented a conceptual 
plan on Feb. 6 that included 
demolishing and reconstructing 
the Genera l Store and 
Groundworks Books buildings to 
make room for new courtyard 
spaces. 

Jim Brown, of the an Diego-
based architectural firm Public, 
presented hi idea to the Building 
Advisory Committee of building 
two new courtyards - one 
"active," facing out toward the 
hump and filling up some of the 
space that would be freed by the 
demolition of the General Store 
Co-op, and one more quiet and 
"passive," back toward Grove 
Caffe and Lot 113 . About 12 
parking spaces would be remo ed 
from Lot 113. 

Brown explained that th.e firm 
is currently in the detailed project 
programming phase, which is fol-
lowed by actual design. While he 
presented a 3-D model, he asked 
·the committee to think of it "as a 
painting," dealing more with con-
cepts than with detailed alloca-
tions of space. 

"We re trying to make one 
central place where people can 
stop, sit or gather, instead of kind 
of cruising and having the feeling 
that you don't quite know where 
to stop," Brown said . "So it's a 
pretty bold move that we propose 
to take out tlle center building of 
thi s complex and to clea r that 
area and connect it to the Hump 
... and to let the energy of the 
Hump flow into the center. " 

Brown's plan has an expanded 
General tore moved to the area 
between Grove affe and the 

ce BAC. Page 7

Vote: Council rejects 'amendment 
to make commissioner appointed 

continued from page I 
Roosevelt College Sophomore Senator 
Max Harrington said. "There was no offi-
cial 'yes' campaign; there was no official 
' no' campaign." 

Harrington was the only senator to 
change his vote from "no~ to "yes" during

ERC Senior Senator Jordan Rosenfeld

commissioners. 

"This year, most of the commissioners 
were appointed," Rosenfeld said. "If you

Administrative professionals 
• • • • to vote on JOinIng unIon 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

University of California administrative 
professionals, a group that includes 1,200 
programmers, counselors, analysts, assis-
tants and other employees at UCSD, will 
soon vote on whether to join the University 
Professionals and Technical Employees, a 
union representing about 12,000 UC tech-
nical employees, researchers and health care 
workers. 

The proposal comes after UPTE sub-
mitted a union petition with signatures 
trom 30 percent of UC administrative pro-
fessionals to the Public Employment 
Relations Board on May 29, 2003. 

The administrative professionals is the 
largest group of non-unionized UC 
employees. 

PERB will mail ballots to employees' 
home addresses on Feb. II, who will have 
30 days to vote and return the ballots. 
PERB will inform UPTE and the universi-
ty of the results in March. Both UPTE and 
the University of California Office of the 
President have encouraged admini trative 
professionals to vote on the initiative. 

"It's extremely important that every indi-
vidual administrative professional employee 
vote in this election, given the potential 
impact on their employment with the uni-
versity," UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said. 
"The university does not discourage or 
encourage unionization, but we very mllch 
encourage employees getting the facts about 
what unionization may mean for them." 

Union officials say they are confident 
that the ~dministrative profe sionals will 
vote in favor of unioniz.ation. For the past 
year, UPTE supporters have held lectures 
and training sessions and mailed brochures 
to educate administrative professionals 
about unioniz.ation. 

"A lot of the founding members of 
UPTE were in job titles that are in this 
group of administrative professionals and 
they wanted to be covered by an UPTE 

conrract," said Carolan Buckmaster, vice 
president of UPTE's San Diego chapter. 
"So we looked at the interest, and there was 
a lot of it." 

However, while many administrative 
professionals are optimistic about the 
union's prospects, not all employees are 
behind the initiative. 

"There are some groups that are very 
eager to unionire and then there arc some 
others who, for whatever reason, seem to 
feel that they're above it, that their job skills 
are in demand and that the university would 
never do anything to them negatively," 
library assistant Bill Pfender said. 

If the initiative is passed, U PTE would 
immediately conduct bargaining surveys in 
preparation for negotiating a contract with 
the university. Currently, administrative 
professionals are under the university'S gen-
eral employment policies. According to 
Buckmaster, UPTE already has some of the 
potential contract language prepared . 
Raises and retirement benefits are two of 
the main issues that UPTE would pursue in 
negotiations. 

"The first thing that we would look at 
would be getting these people a raise," 
Buckmaster said. "We used to say that the e 
people got the crumbs off the table. Well, 
the last two years, they haven't even had any 
crumbs ... In this budget crisis, if this group 
has any chance of getting a raise in the near 
future, the only chance they have is banding 
together as a collective voice under the ban-
ner of U PTE. " 

Programmer/analyst Dean Conde 
agreed, adding that increased representa -
tion and stabili ty were other attractive parts 
of unioniz.ation . 

"1 think basica lly it's to have support, 
the kind of support that we don't have 
now," Conde said. "I've been here for 13 
years and I've just gone on the whims of 
what's happened every year, with the bud-
get and whatnot. ow with the union 
potentiall y representing u ,more of a voice 
can be heard ."

Separate graduations, equal students 
Ethnic graduations are a Distinct ceremonies

Some people believe ' ethnic gradua-tions should be encouraged because they celebrate diversity, and others 
believe that they should be discouraged 
because they encourage division. Either 
way, ASUCSD should no t cut funding to 
ethnic graduations. In fact, disapproval of 
ethnic graduations is an important reason 
why they should continue to receive fund-
ing. 
" If the A.S. Council removed funding for 

ethnic graduations, as Vice President 
Finance Eric Webster proposed Feb. 4, it 
would be si milar to stining free speech. 
T his conclusion may not be immediately 
obvious, but follows naturally from two 
contentions. T he first is that ethnic gradu-
ations are the equivalent to free expression. 
The second is that removing fu nding for 
ethnic graduations has the same effect as 
imposing a ban on ethnic graduations, 
because it is not realistic for the clubs to 
raise the required money on their own. 

Ethnic graduations express the desire of 
graduates to be seen as a community with 
similar cultural outlooks. Just as some 
forms of performative expression may not 
literally be speech, it is sti ll the expression 
of a particular opinion or idea . 

Anyone who has made ancmpts to raise 
funds for school organizations knows how 
difficult and time consuming it is . This 
additional burden of raisi ng funds for the 
gf3duation ceremonies - a burden that is 
not borne by those attending regular, col-
lege-level graduation ceremonies - would 
considerably limit the number of people 
who could be included. 

U.S. citizens have what shou ld be con-
sidered reasonable limitations ro the exer-
cise of free speech - for example, it is not 
a good idea to yell "fire" in a crowded cin-
ema if there is no fire. There are defama-
tion laws to preve nt libel and slander. The 
political expre sion implicit in ethnic grad-
uations, the expression that is being cO/1sid-
ered for suppression, does not come any-
where close to violating these 
limitations. There is no incite-

then we are deluding ourselves. It only masks 
the problem, and stops the search for a true 
solution, as things worsen and fester unseen 
and untreated. 

It is not really disputable that there is little 
racial integration on the UCSD campus. 
Beyond the numerous organizations based on 
racial and/or religious lines, just a simple 
observation of the tables in Price Center will 
show the extent of the problem. Cutting fi.md-

ing for ethnic graduation will not 
change this either. It has at best a 

ment ro violence or prejudi ce.

By LOGAN GOR, Senior Staff Writer 

Shawn No/Guordan 

W hen Vice President Finance Eric Webster complains that one of ASUCSDs policies contravenes its 
own bylaws, that's probably the first clue that 
something is wrong. But Webster's recent 
call to cut funding for culturally themed 
graduation ceremonies was just one of sever-
al reminders that there's something sketchy 
about these extra graduation celebrations 
held at UCSD (and funded by the 
A.S. Council and individual col-
lege councils) at the end of each 
year. 

And tl13t "something" may 
just be the entire concept behind 
the ceremonies. 

According to Webster, whose 
Jan. 26 letter to the editor in the 
Guardian cautioned against pro-
moting racism and requested the discontinu-
ation of funding for culturally centered grad-
uation ceremonies, ASUCSD allocated 
$8,000 last year to help fund celebrations that 
"ranged from the APSA [Asian Pacific 

. islander Student Alliance] and MEChA 
[Movimiento Estudianti l 

" 

promoting racial and cultural unity and 
equality. There is no justifiable reason for 
this kind of segregation. The forced distinc-
tion between different cultures in a tradition 
as revered and time-honored as a graduation 
is hardly a stellar means of promoting har-
mony and diversity among UCSD students. 
Rather, it's essentially claiming that the col-
lege experiences of a student involved in the 
LGBTA and a student of Philippine descent, 
would deviate so significantly that entirely 
separate graduation ceremonies for each 
would be merited. 

That's a dangerous precedent to set.(not 
to mention fodder for the notorious lack of a 
community feel at UCSD). Students can 
attend both their college and ethnic gradua-
tion ceremonies, but the time cOlTunitment 
involved in each probably means that they 
won't. If left unchecked, the worst-case sce-
nario could result in the standard college-
wide graduations being attended only by 
straight white men, a group likely doomed to 
an inability to front their own graduation 
ceremony for fear of sounding like the Ku 
Klux Klan. (The same activists who ripped up 
The Koala on Library Walk would be protest-
ing in a matter of seconds.) 

But it's not just the ethics of crossing the 
line between celebrating diversity and pro-
moting segregation that makes separate cere-
monies a poor idea : The fuct that 'we pay for 
this exclusivity just makes things that much 
worse. 

While $8,000 may seem like small change 
to an organization with roughly a $1.5-mil-
lion budget, it's a relatively large amount 
given how many organizations and events the 
budget is supposed to fund. Furthermore, the 
fi.mding of cultural graduation ceremonies 
only masquerades itself as being concordant 
with A.S . policies. 

In his letter, Web ter claimed that "a total 
of six bylaws would need to be suspended to 
fund these events;" among them, bylaws pro-
hibiting the allocation of funds for honors or 
awards, the allocation of funds for decora-

tions, equipment or food and 
the allocation of fi.lllds not 
open to all students. 

While Webster contends 
that graduation ceremonies are 
exempt from such restrictions, 
the latter bylaw technically still 
stands. 

Even that wasn't enough to 
convince ASUCSD to recon-

sider its funding. The bylaws, as Webster 
pointed out, are there for a reason. It isn't dif-
ficult to see why, particularly in the context of 
graduation ceremonies. There's no reason for 
ASUCSD to uke funds intended to benefit 
the student body as a whole and instead allo-

cate them in such a way that

If such ceremonies were to be made avail-

campus - a logistical and financial night-

fair: Allow all students to anend a ceremony 
in which they could celebrate their accom-
plishments among peers with similar inter-

were rbar quick and that easy to assimilate -
the ceremonies would still only benefit one-
fo urth of the student body: the graduating 
selliors. 

Unfortunately, even with said seniors still 
about four months away from graduating, it's 
too late to rectify last year's mistakes, thanks 
to the Feb. 4 vote.

OPINION 5 

Distant conflid hits home 
with local divisions 

Hamas. 

Making sense of medi.a manipulation 
Dean's slump due to exaggerated TV portrayal 

Big Sister 
Claire J. Vannette 

I t's hard to be particularly excited about this weeks news on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. If I 
~ere an optimist, I might swmily men-
non that Israel's Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon stated plans to withdraw set-
tlers from the Gaza Strip and shorten 
the barrier/fence/wall. But as a com-
mitted cynic, 1 can o nly puzzle over his 

~notivations (which probably don't 
mclude a genuine desire for peace). Is 
he tryi ng to secure a legacy? Improve 
his image in light of the bribery 
charges? Solicit American support, 
knowing that we're increasingly ner-
vous about looking anti-Arab' 

Limitless pessimism has always 
been one of my character flaws, and I 
have long had a very cloudy view of the 
Israeli -Palestinian conflict. A two-state 
solution is clearly the only viable out-
come, but the chances of getting there 
and making it work seem ludicrously 
smaU. Intransigent extremists control 
the majority in the middle, which is 
frightened and easily swayed in to justi-
ficatlons of reprehensible behavior. 
How can it ever be settled? What kind 
of a world aWliits my baby sisters, now 
JUSt toddlers? 

If I were a glass-half-full kind of 
girl, I might hail the resignation of 400 
members &om Palestinian Prime 
Minister Vasser Arafat's Fatah move-
ment as a sign of. dissatisfaction wi th 
the movements corrupt leadership and 
irs inability to advance the peace 
process. Instead, I fret over the destabi-
lization of Farah and possible ascen-
dancy of more radical elements like 

On some level, I acknowledge that 
throwing my hands up and crying 
"Hopeless'" is a cop-out. It enables me 
to turn away. I can't be expected to 
devote my energies to a lost cause, can 
I? What's on "Friends" tonight? 

That said, I have a lot of respect for 
those who can maintain a positive out-
look on the situation, those who forge 
on toward a solution instead ofbecom-
ing discouraged and dispirited. We 
ne~d more people unlike me, who 
belIeve they can make themselves 
heard above the clatter. 

But its hard not to be disheartened 
when all around me theres evidence of 
the same intransigence and manipula-
tion that's directly driving the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. There's a silent 
tension on campus between Jewish and 
Muslim groups, which occasionally 
erupts into bitter displays of divisive-
ness, like the furor over 2001's anti-
Zionism week or last years flyer 
defacements. As intell igent young peo-
ple, we should break down our inherit-
ed divisions, not strengthen them. 

Its no better among grown-ups, of 
course. My mother recently forwarded 
me an e-mail she'd received from one 
of her friends from temple. She knew 
me to be an urban legend buster and 
asked me to check out the message. 

The e-mail, which had been circu-
lating for some time among San 
Diegos educated, personable, cheerful 
Jewish women, pointed out that while 
Muslims comprise some 20 percent of 
the worlds population, they had won 
just six Nobel Prizes; Jews (0.2 percent 
of the worlds population) have been 
awarded 161. "Clearly, Arabs and 
Muslims need to focus more on educa-
tion," the e-mail snidely suggested. 

I was horrified. The statistics were 
factually correct, but the judgment of

Six, three or even one month 
ago, the attitude of Dean for 
America - the movement to put 
Howard Dean in the White 
House - was optimistic and 
enthusiastic, wi th the campaign 
making especia lly impressive 
headway with traditionally disaf-
fected college students. As the 
Guardillll reponed Feb. 2, UC 
employees overwhelmingly 
favored Dean over any other can-
didate, collectively contributing 
over $45,000 to his campaign. 

The money that UC employ-
ees gave to the fomler Vermont 
governor is chump change com-
pared to the $14.8 million he 
rai~d in a three-month period, 
which makes Dean the most suc-
cessful Democratic fundraiser in 
history. Most of this money was 
raked in through small gi fts ($ 100 
is the suggested donation) 
through llis Web site, the hub for 
grassroots organization the likes of 
which America hasn't seen since 
- older generations tell me -
McGovern's 1972 campaign. 

It seemed that Dean was 
unstoppable, or at least a shoo-in 
for the Democratic nomination. 
And then a "Yeeeeeeeah!" spelled 
"no" for the campaign. After the 
press painted Dean as angry, the 
formerly promising candidate 
made a disappointing showing at 
the Iowa caucus and, much more 
importantly, made the speech that 
signaled his demise. 

The speech itself was a varia-
tion of his stump speech, a pep 
talk to his supporters coming out 
of an unexpected Iowa defeat. He 
ended it with the "yeah" that 
echoed 'round the world - or at

least U .S. media outlets - in 
altered form, with the volume of 
Deans voice cranked up while the 
volume of his cheering supporters 
was cranked way down. 

Was Dean's speech, or the cry 
at the end of it, out of the ordi-
nary? Hardly. Did the doctored 
version make him look like a red-
faced idiot with deafening vitriol 
spewing out his mouth? Yes. 

The impact of such a misrep-
resentation can't be underestimat-
ed; even staunch Dean supporters 
found themselves wavering, as 
Dean seemed to morph into a 
monster before their very eyes. 

All this shows that it doesn't 
take votes, an honest deba te or a 
superior candidate to take down :I 
presidential hopeful. In tead, it 
simply takes a negative media 
portrayal engineered by a behind-
the-scenes technician with sound 
editing equipment. The message 
is clear: Videos and sound byres 
make or break candidates, and it 
only takes one damnin« media 
. 0 
Image to send a candidate on a 
downward spiral. 

This is more or less common 
knowledge - President Bush, for 
example, knew that an image of 
him in a flight suit would burn 
into viewers' mi nds a conception 
of him as heroic and hands-on _ 
but it's shameful that such manip-
ulation still dominates 1V air-
waves and that viewers don't real-
ize they're being misled. 

Political candidates continual-
ly call for honorability, account-
ability, honesty and elections that ' 
focus on the issues. Somehow, 
t.his message never makes it 
through to 1V newscasts, which 
continually ignore the issues upon 
which the election rests, di hon-
estly repreSent candidates and are 

held accountable solely by plm-
dits who are quickly labeled "con-
spiracy theorists" or "radicals." 
The power of TV as a medium 
comes from the power of images. 
How is it radical to acknowledge 
the power that these images tmly 
have over us' 

Social psychologist Joel 
Charon writes, "Humans act in a 
world tlley define, and although 
there may actually be a reality out 
there, their defillition is far more 
important to what they do." 
American TV media outlets por-
traye? H oward Dean as a raving 
IlUlaoc, and voters tailored their 
definition of him accordingly. 
Now his campaign is struggling, 
W,ltll Dean speaking of "making 
hiS last stand" in Wisconsin 
dropping out of the race if h~ 
loses that state's primary. 

Too often, current politics 
come down to simplistic assess-
ments, sound bytes or nashy 
Images. Wesley Clark blinks too 
little. George Bush blinks too 
much, stutters and smirks. John 
Edwards looks "too young to be 
president," even though he's 50 
years old. John Kerry looks like 
the victim of botched plastic 
surgery. And Dean? He's nothing 
more than a thick neck, a red-
dened face and a "Yeeeeeeeeah!" 

Americans have a myriad of 
ways to cut through the 1V 
media spin and go straight to the 
sources (like the candidate ' Web 
sites), but we prefer to bite off our 
news in spoonfuls of already-
digested simplifications. In theo-
ry, watching the 1V news is much 
better than not exposing oneself 
to any news at all, but when TV 
anchors do such a terrible job of

fairly representing reality, the whole 
point it lost. 

As the Michigan and Washington 
caucuses approached - in which 
Dean finished second - the Boston 
Globe reported that the former 
Vermont governor is "back in the 
ring." But was he ever out of the 
ring' Not to the 50 percent of voters 
who, according to a Feb. 6 
Associated Press poll, disapprove of 
president Bush. In light of the 
admission that our reason to wage 
war on [raq - a cache of weapons of 
mass destruction - doesn't exist, 
support for our current president is 
slipping. His support is already 
down from the 56 percent that it was 
a mere month ago. In the same 
Associated Press poll, 43 percent of 
respondents said they would defi-
nitely vote for someone else, com-
pared to 37 percent. who said they 

would definitely vote for Bush. 
Most likely, these numbers come 

as surprising news. So far, the 
Democratic primaries have been 
treated like a joke, wi th Democratic 
candidates' criticism of President 
Bush dismissed as partisan ram-
blings. Yet, Will Lester of the 
Associated Press reported, "Bush's 
47 percent approval rating is the 
same as his father's at this stage in his 
presidency 12 years ago before he 
lost to Bill Clinton." History could 
repeat itself this year. 

That is to say, while there may 
not be hope for Dean, there is most 
defi nitely hope for the other 
Democratic candidates. Just like in 
2000, the election could come down 
to mere thousands of votes, and 
these thousands of VOtes will largely 
depend on how Democratic candi-
dates are treated in the media. With 
Dean an easy target for negative 

media portrayals, John Kerry might 
slip past the media gauntlet mostly 
intact, with Democratic voters see-
ing him as a sane alternative to 
Dean's angry, out-of-control ways. 
Perhaps this is already happening, as 
Kerry'S support is increasing expo-
nentially. 

For Dean, everything depends on 
the Feb. 17 Wisconsin primary; hes 
vowed to quit the race if he loses 
Wisconsin. What irony, considering 
that his staunch opposition LO the 
Iraq war has been vindicated by Bush 
Administration officials' admission 
that, in the words of former top U .S. 
weapons inspector David Kay, "we 
were alm!>St all wrong" about Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction. Yet 
stranger things have happened. An 
otherwise mundane moment has 
grown to define his entire campaign, 
thanks to some clever manipulation 
by an WlSCen hand.

Arabs and Muslims as culturally 
inferior to Jews was appall ing. I 
couldn't believe that 1 had attended a 
dinner party at the home of the 
woman who'd found this e-mail 
worth passing along. If you asked 
this woman if she considered herself 
a racist or a religious bigot, she'd 
certainly say no, shocked that you 
had even considered the possibi li ty. 

BlIt make no mistake: This e-
mail plays upon the basest preju-
dices. It smacks of what [ call the 
"tl1Ose people" mentality. One group 
looks down its collective nose at 
another group, vilifying them as the 
ultimate "other," completely foreign 
and t,otally homogenous. Sometimes 
it can be seemingly benign - "You 
know those Asians, with their good 
grades and strict parents" ~ but 

other times, decidedly more si nister. 
When the U.S. Postal Service 
released a stamp commemorating 
Muslim culture and festiva ls, my 
mom got another e-mail from her 
friend: "Rtmtmber the Muslim 
bombing of PanAm Flight 103' 
Rtmember the Muslim bombing of 
the World Trade Center in 1993! ... 
Rtmember the Muslim bombing of 
the USS Cole! Remember the Muslim 
attack on the Twin Towers on 
9/ 11 12001! Rtmtmber all the 
American lives that were lost in those 
vicious Muslim attacks!" 

That was the last straw for Mom. 
She e-mailed her friend, firmly ask-
ing that she no longer be included in 
such e-dispatches, as she did not 
agree with their viewpoint and dis-
approved of their tone. 

So I guess I should be opti mistic 

about what lies in store for my baby 
sisters as they grow up. Yes, they're 
bound to encounter intolerance and 
prejudice - whether directed 
against them or exhibited by people 
who claim to be on their "side" -
but they will learn that this isn't okay, 
and they don't have to take it quietly. 

The pessimism is hard to get 
over, though . While I find it 
adorable and a little strange when 
my sister Sadie, who is t11Ice, says 
the shabbat blessing over the can-
dies, fumbling with the Hebrew and 
peeking through her fingers as she 
covers her eyes, I wonder what view-
points will surround her, and how 
she'll fare in their midst. .

City huttle and a 15 percent 
decrease in the sale of annual 'S' 
parking permits frol11 2002-03, 
accord ing to Arovas. 

The Cityshuttle expanded this 
year to include larger buse and a 
route to University Towne Center. 

nee said that thl! increase in rider-
ship indicates the possibility that 
shuttle services will continue to 
expand. 

T he restriction of freshman 
parking and the expansion of 
City huttle were some of many 
options considered to accommo-
date changes in parking on cam-
pus if the construction projects 
were not delayed, according to 
Arovas. 

"There were other options to 
spend money on increasing surface 
lots in the East Campus area, 
which we did," Arovas said. 

Anorher alternative included 
elimi nating the bike path, which 
the TPC decided against. In order 
to compensate for the parking lots 
that wi ll eventually be displaced 
by the construction projects, the 
TPC also plan~ to build new park-
ing structures, one o n Voight 
Drive and Hopkins Drive and the 
other on the Revelle College cam-
pus. 

Snee said the Hopkins Parking 
Structure woul d be "expensive" to 
construct, costing $2.9 million for 
1,400 spaces. 

"That is why parking permits 
are expensive," he said. "We're 
sel f-supporting, funded from park-
ing permit money and citation rev-
enue." 

Campus Planni ng has 
approved of the seven -level 
Hopkins Parking Structure and 
the TPC. 

If approved by t he UC 
Regents, construction on the 
Hopkins P arki ng Strucrure is 
scheduled to begin in January 
2005, with the opening slated for 
August 2006. 

Many current · freshmen agree 
with the decision to keep freshma n 
parking for fa ll 2005. 

"They better keep freshmen 
pa rki ng," T hurgood Marshall 
College freshman Danh Ho said. 
"It's a real inconvenience - where 
would the freshmen go?" 

E leanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Vanessa Real agreed. 

"I wouldn't want to come to the 
school if they had elimina ted 
[freshman parking], because 
they're forci ng us to be antisocial 
and stay on campus," Real said. 
"UCSD isn't that social. 
Everything's far." 

TPC wi ll revisit the freshma n 
parking issue during spri ng quarter 
2004 to discuss plans for 2005. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 7 

BAC: Moving Groundworks, General Store Co .. op proposed 
continued from page I 

bike shop, taking a part of the area 
of the current Groundworks 
Books, and would face out onto 
the quieter courtyard. 
Groundworks Books would be 
reconstructed further south at the 
edge of that courtyard in a long 
rectangular shape, which Brown 
hoped would prove more useful in 
providing usable space \)lan its 
current hexagon-like configura-
tion. 

By removi ng the General 
Store, the GUllrditm offices imme-
diately above it would also be 
demolished, which Brown pro-
posed be re located above the new 
General Store, making them adja-
cen t to the second -floor studen t 
organization offices in the space 
currently occupied by a roof deck 
atop Groundworks Books. 

All other Student Center build-
ings would remain untouched; 
with the exception of an addition-
al 200 square feet for the Lecture 
Notes/Soft Reserves building. A 
new office, with u e as of yet unde-
termined, would also be built 
above the new Groundworks 
Books. 

While the General Store would 
get a n extra 700 square feet, 
Groundworks will get none. 

"I'd love to give everybody 

more square footage, but we have 
a very hard-line b udget to meet," 
Brown said, adding that he had to 
stick to the legal limitations of the 
expansio n referendum. 

He also proposed to plant more 
trees in the area provided by the 
remova l of parking and construct-
ing a "slcybridge" walkway that 
would expand out from the second 
floor out toward the parking lot, 
but stop in the middle of the trees. 

Brown also proposed to elimi-
nate the two-hour metered park-
ing spots of Lot 113 spots and 
replace them with 3 O-minute spots 
to increase the flow of customers 
and decrease parking of Srudent 
Center employees. 

The committee did not come 
to any consensus on whether they 
approved of the two courtyards, 
and much of the discussion 
revolved around the reduction of 
parking. 

"r personally think it would be 
wise to keep as much parking as 
possible," Earl Warren College rep-
resentative Aaron Sheinbein said. 

A.S. Council representative 
Max Harrington said he has not 
made his mind up about the park-
ing idea. 

"From the outset of the project 
itself, there was a strongly negative 
reaction to any idea of removing 

parking at Student Center," 
Harrington said. "Even so, I'm glad 
that the architects were bold 
enough to propose removing park-
ing - they probably knew that 
they would get a negative reaction 
to the idea, but I'm appreciative that 
we have architects that are indepen-
dent enough to propose ideas that 
they know might not be popular 
with some on the committee." 

The committee also discussed 
addi tional space for new student 
organization offices or for retail. 

BAC University Centers 
Advisory Board representative 
J eren'ly Cogan, who in his position 
as A.S. commissioner of enterpris-
es works with the Grove Caffe, 
expressed concern that allocating 
too much space to retail may 
increase competition between 
food enterprises in an area where 
the supply of customers is not as 
concentrated as in Price Center. 

BAC Co-Chair Justin Williams 
also pointed out that he saw little 
interest on the part of student 
organizations for moving into 
Srudent Center. 

"My only concern is that cur-
rently with space requests about 
80 percent of student orgs would 
rather have a Price Center office 
than a Student Center office," 
Williams said. "However, the 

Student Center in Phase II [of 
expansion] is going to be a com-
pletely different place, so I really 
don't know what requests will be 
like at that time." 

Brown said he will gather morc 
input on his proposal as he contin-
ues to work on the detailed project 
programming. 

"I thought the plan they pre-
sented was a great start," 
Harrington said. "I think the fact 
that there was so much immediate 
reaction and debate indicates JUSt 
hO\,: intricate the design issues 
involved in the project are. I felt 
sorry for the poor architects, how-
ever - they work so hard at pre-
senting a plan, and it felt like they 
received almost nothing but criti-
cism and caution ... Regardless, 
however, the coming debate will 
be very intcresting and I'm look-
ing forward to participating in it ." 

The scheme Public is working 
with, which was approved by the 
BAC on Dec. 5, 2003, will COSt $7 
million and will add 2,700 gro 
square feet. 

The next BAC meeting, which 
will be held on Feb. 20 at I p.m. in 
the Paul DeWine Student 
Leadership Chambers, will be 
used to collect and review com-
ments on Public's detailed project 
programming draft.

Americans during World War II is 
an unforgettable part of American 
history. On Feb. 19, 1942, 
Presidenr Franklin D . Roosevelt 
signed E,xecutive Order 9066, 
effectively suspending the ci\<il lib-
erties of Japanese Americans by 
relocating them to internment 
camps. Every year on this day, 
Japanese Americans across the 
United States come together for a 
national Day of Remembrance for 
the internment, finding power in 
the collective memory and con-
sciousness. 

When Rooscvelt signed the 
Order, Japanese Americans were 
forced to 'evacuate from their homes 
and movcd to internment camps 
located in California, Arizona, Utah, 
Idaho, Wyoming and Arkansas. 
\Vithin six months of Roosevelt's 
orde r, over 120,000 people of 
Japanese descent had been relocated. 
About 70,000 of those relocated 
were U.S. citizens by birth. 

This year, Nikkei Student 
Union at UCS D will honor the 
Day of Remembrance. SU hopes 
to use the day ro promote aware-
ness, to honor those who suffered, 
and to warn against future injus-
rices against anyone. 

"We hope that the Day of 
Remembrance will help educate the 
UCSD campus of the struggles and 
hardships that Japanese Americans 
had to face during the war, and that 
we can lea rn from the past." said 

SU president Stacy Toyota. 
T his yea r, NSU will hold its 

even ts at Price Center Plaza from 
II a.m. to 3 p.m. on Feb. 19. The 
event will fe ature information 
exhibits complete with photos, 
accounts and arti facts from differ-
ent internment camps. The event 
will host guest speakers George 
Wakiji. president of the Ventura 
Club chapter of the Japanese 
American Citizens League, and 
Peter Irons, UCSD political sci-
ence professor and practicing civil 
rights and liberties morney. 

Wakiji was interned at the Gila 
River Relocation Center in Arizona 
during WWlI. In the I 980s, Irons 
was the lead counsel in a successful 
Supreme Court case to reverse the 
crimin al convictions of three 
Japanese Americans - Gordon 
Hirabayas hi , Minoru Yasui j!nd 
Fred Korematsu - who challenged 
curfew and relocation orders.

Moment of silence: Dorthea Lange's image of the Manzanar Relocation Camp, 
one of 10 camps where Japanese Americans were interned during World War II. 

"The internment of Japanese 
Americans during World War II is 
often overlooked in most American 
history curriculums, so one of the 
main goals of this year 's Day of 
Remembrance is to increase the 
awareness of the civil rights viola-
tions that took place from J 942 to 
1945," said Kristen Iwata, NSU 
chair for this year's event. "We also 
hope to show that, although it was 
only those of Japanese descent that 
were affected then, the right aJ1d 
freedoms of any group could be 
taken away in a simila r fashion ." 

Accord ing to Wayne A. 
Cornelius, UCSD political science 
professor and director of the 
Center for Comparative 
Immigration Studies, the internees 
included 30 University of 
California faculty and research 
assistants, as well as 400 undergrad-
uate students. The internment was 
the largest forced migration in 
United States history. 

"There is a long history of anti-
Japanese sentiment in the United 
States dating back to the late 19th 
century, which is why we had a 
'Japanese exclusion clause' included 
in the 1924 immigration bill," 
Cornelius said. "But the wartime 
hysteria of 1942 was clearly the cat-
alyst for the forced relocation." 

Over 40 years later, President 
Ronald Reagan signed the Civil 
Liberties Act of 1988, in which 
Congress declared the internment 
"a grave injustice" and offered a 
national apology. Executive Order 
9066 was reversed and reparations 
were made to living survivors from 
the camps. According to Irons, 

about 60,000 people of Japanese 
descent came forward to claim 
repa rations. and each, received 
$20,000 from the government. 

"The reparations were not the 
result of a groundswell of public 
remorse about the relocation ," 
Cornelius said. "Congress acted 
onl), after years of prodding by 
some of its own members who had 
been sent off to relocation camps 
themselves." 

The question of whether such 
monetary reparations arc enough, 
however, sti ll remains. 

"I remember my grandpa telling 
me once that the compensation 
check they got back from the gov-
ernment would never repay what 
they lost when they went to the 
camps: their homes, lives [and! jobs 
were all taken away from them in a 
matter of days," TOy0f3 said. 

For many Japanese Americans, 
the day is also a time to personally 
reflect on the wartime experiences 
of family members. For Toyota, the 
day has personal significance 
because twO of her grandparents 
were interned, one in Arkansas and 
the other in Wyoming. 

Oil have seen the pictures and 
heard stories a hout their times in 
the camps, but it still amazes me 
how they endured it," Toyota said. 

Brent Mori, a Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore and 
NSU member, has grandparents 
who were forced to relocate. 

"[My grandmother] and her 
family had to move to different 
places in the .United States, includ-

Remembrance: Events 
honor internment survivors 

continued from page J 0 
ing Utah, somewhere in the 
Midwest and multiple places in 
California," Mori said. "She also 
used to tell me about the 'J- town' 
that used to be in Sacra men to, but it 
was gone by the time the war was 
over. It was sad hearing about the 
uprooting of the entire community." 

I n addition to the relocation, 
many Japanese Americans lost their 
homes, businesses and personal pos-
sessions. and put their education and 
careers on hold . Many imprisoned 
families had relatives who served or 
were serving in the U.S. military 
during the war. For example, the 
100th Battalion/442nd Regimental 
Combat Team that fought in Italy 
was entirely Japanese American and 
received over 18,000 individual dec-
oration honors, becoming the most 
decorated unit in U.S. military his-
tory. 

"One of the most important 
lessons that I've always been taught 
is that even though most of the 
Japanese Americans gOt interned, 
many of the men that sti ll went to 
war as Americans proved their 
patriotism," Mori said. "My grand-
father was in the army along with a 
lot of his close friends. and they 
remained true to America despite 
what was going on. So to remain 
true to the country, and be united 
by being American, rather than 
being separated by race, is an 
important concept." 

For ome, the Day of 
Remembrance also has an especially 
poignant meaning in the aftermath 
of the events of Sept. II, 2001 . 

"As we have seen from 9/11, we 
as Americans still have a long way 
to go in terms of accepting differ~ 
ent cuJrures and not being so quick 
to point fingers and pass judge-

ments," Toyota said. 
According to Cornelius, the 

government's po t-Sept. I I actions 
have revived the issue of racial 
groups' rights in the United States. 

"Immigrants ' rights arc always 
at risk in time of war or other 
threats to national security, and the 
blatant discrimination in the U.S. 
government's post-9/11 detentions 
and 'special registration program' is 
a potent reminder," Cornelius said. 

The Day of Remembrance 
events are meant for anyone who is 
interested in learning about 
Japanese American histo ry. 

"We are targeting all members 
of the UCSD community in this 
event," Toyota said. "We hope we 
can get as many people as possible 
to come check Out our events for 
the day. We want to educate and 
spread awareness of this sometimes 
forgotten event in American histo-
ry." 

As an organization, NSU pro-
motes awareness of Japanese 
American culture and history with-
in the UCSD and San Diego com-
munities.

and Feb. 7 to repeat its perfor-
mance of last weekend at UCSD. 

Last week, the Tritons beat 
San Francisco State, 71-57, and 
lost a tough game to Sonoma 
State, 60-55. The results were 
almest identical on the road. 
UCSD easily handled San 
Francisco State 62-44 and lost 
another close contest to Sonoma 
State, 70-65. 

UCSD moved its overall record 
to 11-8, with a 7-7 Cali fornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
record . San Francisco State 
dropped to 9-9 overall and 5-8 in 
the CCM, while Sonoma 
improved to 12-7 overall and 9-5 in 
the CCAA. 

UCSD played both games 
without its leading scorer and 
rebounder, junior Margaret 
John on. 

"It hurt not having her there," 
freshman guard Leora Juster said. 
"She's a solid presence. But people 
picked up for her." 

(n a series of presentations from February 11 - March 17,2004. UCSD Am 
faculty will explore and demonstrate the convergence of intuition and research in 
creating an. developing new art fonns. and seeking an understanding of creative 

processes and perceptual responses to art. 1be flI1it presentation will be by 

Theodore Shank 
UCSD Professor Emerirus a/Theatre and Dance 

"Beyond musion: 
Alternative Theatre in the USA" 

Professor Shank will draw upon his recent book and use projections in ltis discus ion 
of experimental theatre in the United States. Experimental theatre anists base their 
work on their experience of living in the world of today rather than on conventions 
of an earlier time. They create unique fonns to express this experience and often 
their work is seen as confrontational because it shatters the expectations of spectators 
who are accustomed to older foons. 

There are two characleristics of alternative theatre in the USA that have endured 
from the 1960. to the presenlFirst, the productlons are experimental: Instead of 
accepting conventions which were devised in the past to express emotive experience 
of the time, these artists experiment with and create new foons to best express their 
experience of living in the world of today. Second, the perfonnances tend to brealc. 
tbrough illusion; Spectators are made to focus on the perfonnance itself, on perfonners 
and the circumstances of perfonnance. instead of, or in addition to. a fictional illusion 
of people living in a separate time and place.

Attention: Brainiacs! This did not seem to affect the 
Tritons in the first game against the 
Lancers, as they bounced back 
from an early deficit to take an 11-
9 lead in the opening minutes, then 
kept the lead for the rest of the 
game. UCSD was up 31-18 at half 
time, having finished the half on an 
8-0 run.

the lineup this ~, as the team split their two road games on Feb. 6 and Feb. 7.

In the second half, UCSD never 
led by fewer than 13 points and led 
by as many as 20. They won 62-44, 
thanks in large part to UCSD's 41-
percent field goal percentage ver-
sus San Francisco State' 28 per-
cent. 

Juster led the team in scori ng 
with 18 points, and junior center 
Stacy Bolton-Gallagher had a 
solid all -around game with eight 
points, nine rebounds and seven 
assists. 

Juster noticed the solid play of 
Bolton-Gallagher over the pas t 
couple of weeks. 

"She's been playing great," 
Juster said. "Real good." 

Chrissy Ridenour had 18 points 
for the Lancers to go along with II 

rebounds and four blocks. 
On Feb. 7, UCSD again played 

a difficult game against the Sonoma 
State. The first hal f was extremely 
close, with neither team being able 
to open up a lead larger than three 
points. The Seawolves led at the 
half by a score of 34-3 1. 

The Seawolves were able to 
lengthen their lead slightly, as 
they pushed the lead to seven 
points before seeing it vanish. 
The teams remained close for the 
rest of the game, and were tied at 
58 with less than two minutes 
remaining. 

Sonoma State went on to score 
the next five points and hit free 
throws in the last minutes to put 
the game out of reach. It was 
UCSD's second-straight loss by a 
margin of five points to the 
Seawolves, this time, 70-65.

Softball: Bland pitches secon~ complete game 
cominued from page 16 

strong pushes by UCSD. 
"We left seven runners on base, 

and just couldn't get them home 
[and we had) a few crucial errors," 
Gerckens said. 

Senior shortshop Kim Aggabao 
knocked a double to score junior 
leftfielder Breanne Cope in the 
bottom of the third inning. 
Aggabao went 2-4 with an RBIs for 
the game, one of two Tritons who 
had a multiple-hit night. Cope pro-
vided more offense in the bottom 
of the seventh, smashing a home 
run and going 3-3 with two runs 
and an RBIs on the night. But the 
Tritons were behind when time ran 
out. 

"Both Tina [Rowe) and Jodie 
[Bland) pitched very well today. In 
the second game they scored four 
runs, but only three were earned," 
Gerckens said. "Both pitchers have 
been very strong, and they're going 
the distance. Our whole 
pitcher/catcher battery is working 
well together." 

UCSD returned to its winning 
form on Feb. 7, soundly defeating 
Cal State Stanislaus, 9-1, in the 

first game. 
The li-itons scored early and 

often, notching up a run in the bot-
tom of the first and third innings, 
two in the bottom of the fourth and 
fifth, and three in the sixth to put 
them over the eight-run limit rule. 
UCSD's offense received a couple 
boosts in the arm from a pair of 
home runs by junior catcher Jamie 
Hurst and sophomore rightfielder 
Niki Anderson, her second of the 
season. 

Rowe continued her streak of 
complete game victories, bringing 
her total up to four, and her record 
on the season to 4-0, giving up one 
run on three hits. 

"TIna has just been amazing; 
she is on fire," Gerckens said. '"I 
attribute the great pitching this 
year to cOJich Stan Hunt, he has 
really got them prepared for the 
season." 

The Tritons fared similarly well 
in the second game of the series, 
besting the Warriors, 7-\' UCSD 
jumped to an early lead in the first 
inning, scoring oncc, and then 
piled on six more runs in the bot-
tom of the third. Cal State 

Stanislaus snagged one run in the 
fifth, but that was the extent of its 
offensive production. 

Offensive highlights for the sec-
ond game against the Warriors 
included junior catcher Jamie 
Hurst going 2-2 with a run and 
four RBIs, as well as senior third 
baseman Amy Mettee who went 2-
4 with two runs and an RBIs. 
Aggabao added a run and an RBIs 
while going 2-4, and Cope tacked 
on a run while going 2-3. 

"I'm really impressed with how 
we're playing as a team," Hurst 
said. "It's great Winching younger 
players step up and the older kids 
do their jobs right." 

Bland hurled her second com-
plete game, bringing her record up 
to 2-2 on the year, giving up one 
earned run on four hits. 

"We've been playing really well 
and with confidence, and we need 
to keep that," Gerckens said. "It's 
easy to play well when things are 
going well, but when times get 
tough we see what kind of team we 
really are."

Feb. 13 at Chico State.

an early lead when its third base-
man, John Acha, smacked a two-
run home run to right field in the 
top of the first. 

In the bottom of the fifth inning, 
Triton senior catcher Jeff Riddle 
launched a two-run home run to 
right field , bringing UCSD within 
three of Sacramento State. The 
game was suspended due to darkness . 
at 5-2 in favor of the Hornets. 

When play resumed on Feb. 7, 
UCSDs Pinocchio and rightfielder . 
Ryan Langone each blasted solo 
home runs in the eighth and ninth 
innings, respectively. But the Tritons 
came up one run shan in dle game 
and lost by a slim margin of 6-5. 

In gamc two, tho: Tritons scored 
two runs in each of the fi rst, second 
and third innings. Morehead 
smacked his first collegiate home 
run in the bottom of the second 
inning. He went 2-for-4 in the 
game with a double and th ree RBIs. 
Shortstop Keith Hernandez went 
2-for-3 with three RBIs. 

Langone, Clark, Morehead, 
Pinocchio and pinch runner David 
Hawk all had stolen bases in the 
game. 

In two games UCSD hit four 
home runs. UCSD head coach Dan 
O'Brien was pleased ar the offen-
sive productivity, but noted that the 
focus for his team is not on hitting 
home runs. 

"[Our guysl are having quality 
at-bats and dlat is the most impor-
tant dung to us," he said. "The 
[playersl are happy to be hitting 
home runs, but they're not trying 
to hi t home runs. Their focus is on 
having a quality at-bat. That is why 
they are seeing some balls go out of 
the yard. If you have a good at-bat 
at this yard [Triton Baseba ll Field!, 
you'll be rewarded sometimes with 
the wind coming off of the ocean 
and out to right field ." 

Hornet Acha hit two home runs

On the hill: UCSD pitcher Jose Navarro, who threw 3.2 inni ngs in his last start 
against Regis, went 4.2 innings on Feb. 7 against Sacramento State. 
in game two. He and the Sacramento 
State offense chipped away at the 
Triton lead throughout the game, 
but it would not be enough. 

Strong pitching was key to 
UCSD's success. Sophomore pitch-
er Jose Navarro started game two 
and wen t four and two- third 
innings. Junior transfer pitcher 
Ryan Leake (1-0) came on in relief 
and earned his first victory of his 
Triton career. Junior transfer pitch-
er Shlomo Lipetz entered the game 
in the seventh inning. He closed 
the game and earned his first career 
save as a Triton. 

"Our pitching has been phenom-
enal," O'Brien said. "I think its good 
quality pitching, but more impor-
tantly, there is a veteran presence on 
the mound. Our pitchers look like 
they are in control and in command 

of the game at all times. [The oppo-
nent's) hitters are affected by that." 

The victory over the Hornets 
was crucial for UCSD. 

"I think it's a great ~in for the 
program, but I really think it's a 
great win, more imporrandy, for 
the guys, because I think they know 
that they are good and we proved it 
today," O'Brien said. "This reas-
sures [them] that [they) can play 
with anyone in the nation. TQ be 
nonest, we feel that way. We feel 
like we are a team that can compete 
with anybody." 

With a 5-1 record, the Tritons 
face Concordia at li-iton Baseball 
Field on Feb. II. UCSD kicks off 
its 2004 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association season opener 
at home on Feb. 12 against Cal

Men's basketball drops two on the road 
UCSD loses to San Francisco State, Sonoma State

UCSD faces

IyMATT RYAN 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team's road woes continued over 
the weekend as the Tritons lost 
games to San Francisco State, 75-
69, and to Sonoma State, 59-72. 

After beating San Francisco 
State at home six days earlier, 
UCSD traveled to play th~ 
Gators in San Francisco on Feb. 
6 and was unable to win back-to-
back games. Once again, the 
Tritons fe ll behind big early in 
the contest and trailed 22-8 
before the tcn-minute mark. of 
the first half, and once again 
UCSD battled back. and closed 
the gap to only eight at the half, 
37-29. 

UCSD came out of halftime 
with a different face. Sophomore 
guard Mattllew Sweany hit a pair 
of three-pointers and the Tritons 
took. a 53-51 lead. But this was the 
last time the Tritons would see the 
lead since it quickly slipped away 
from them with an 8-0 run by the 
Gators over the next two lninutes. 
Trailing 59-53, the Tritons never 
recovered . 

UCSD was led by Sweany's 
16-point effort, which included 
4-for-5 from three-point range, 
and junior center Jesse Boyd's 15 
points and . five rebounds. 
Redshirt freshman Parker 
Berling provided 13 points off 
the bench, hitting all nine of his 
free throws. Berling also had six 
rebounds and three assis ts. Junior 
Brandon Francis chipped in with 
10 points. 

For San Francisco State, senior 
center Chris Tabarez had a mon-
ster game with 21 points, 10 

rebounds and three steals. Three 
other Gators scored in double dig-
its. Mychal Lynch scored 17 
points, DeAndre Walker scored 16 
points and Ryan Cleaves scored 12 
points. 

Cleaves also contributed a 
game-high eight assists and five 
boards in the victory. 

UCSD then traveled north to 
Rohnert Park to take on the surg-
ing Sonoma State Sea wolves, and 
the Seawolves proved to be too 
much for the Tritons. The 
Tritons kept it close in the first 
half and only trailed by four at 
halftime. 

Sonoma State used a 20-11 run 
out of the half to push a four-point 
lead to 13 . Despite there being 
three Tritons in double-figures, 
UCSD could not get within eight 
points the rest of the way. 

The Seawolves held a 40-31 
advantage on the boards and out-
shOt UCSD, 46 percent to 37 per-
cent. 

UCSD was led by Boyd's IS 
points, while Sweany had 14 
points and sophomore guard Zach 
Zanolli added 13 points. 

The loss for the Tritons drops 
them to 5-14 overall and 5-9in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

Led by Keith Kowal - who 

finished the match with 23 kills to 
lead all players - the Nittany 
Lions grabbed game three, 30-25, 
and appeared ready to send tile 
Tritons home empty-handed. 

UCSD was not to be denied, 
however, and the lritons emerged 
from a hard-fought fourth game 
with a 30-27 win and an opportu-
nity to take the match in the fifth 
and deciding game. 

UCSD head coach Ron Larsen's 
team showed no fear in game five, 
and mowlted an 8-5 rally from a 7-
7 tic to \vin dle. game, 15- 12, and 
the match, 3-2 . T he 1ritons COIl-
nected for nine kills in the final 
frame with zero errors. 

Sophomore outside hitter Jeff 
Urton tallied a team-high of 22 
kills , followed by Toren and 
Keyser with 20 and 16 kills, 
respectively. J ones had 68 assists 
and for the second time in a row 
Toren had three aces in the match. 

Waller, UCSD's team leader in 
kills comi ng into the match, played 
very limited minutes and recorded 
no kill attempts. 

It is possible than the 1i-ilOns' 
split \vill push them back into the 
American Volleyball Coaches' 
Association Top 15, since they 
dropped out of the poll last week. 
However, UCSD will have plenty 
of opportunities to prove its merit 
as it returns to Southern California 
to take on MPSF foes No. 1 
UCLA, No, 9 UC Irvine and o. 2 
Pepperdine on the road on Feb. 13, 
Feb. 14 and Feb. 17, respectively. 

Men's tennis suffers season-opening loss 
No. 10 UCSD is edged, 5-4, by Azusa Pacific in non-conference action 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men 's tenrus team 
had a rough start to its season, losing 
5-4 in a close match to Azusa Pacific 
University in non-conference action 
on Feb. 4 at Azusa, Caljf. 

The Tritons, ranked tenth in 
Division n preseason polls, found 
themselves in a 2-1 hole after losing 
two of three doubles matches to start 
off the first half of the dual meet. 

The second-ranked doubles 
pair, Sameer Chopra and Jeff 
Wilson, lost to Azusa Pacific's 
Gordon Hong and Sam Fletcher, 
9-7, while junior Emi l Novak and 
sophomore Tommy Novak lost to 
Boris Bakalov and Tom Jelsma, 8-
3. The lone doubles victory for 

UCSD was at the hands of senior 
Nick Morton and sophomore 
Brent Molden with their 8-6 win 
over David Goodman and Adam 
Davidson. 

"There were two reasons for [the 
rough start)," UCSD head coach 
Eric Steidl mayer said. "One was that 
the other Squads were good. Two 
was that we didn't bring the level 
that we could have or needed to in 
order to beat those teams." 

T he Tritons stepped up their 
play in singles and split the six 
matches against the Cougars, giv-
ing them a scare, but Azusa Paci fi e 
held on for the close 5 -4 victory. 

Heading the singles portion of 
the match was Chopra, who lost in 
straight sets to Fletcher, 6-3 and 6-
4. At No.2, junior Bryan Swatt also

10 t in straight sets to Boris 
Bakalov, 7-6 and 6-4. Playing at 
No. 6 was senior Arnir Nejad, who 
traded sets with Jelsma but lost the 
third set. The total score for that 
match was 6-3,4-6 and 6-3 . 

Wilson, Emil Novak and 
Molden secured three singles vic-
tories for UCSD. At No.3, Wilson 
defeated Goodman in three sets, 7-
6, 4-6 and 7-6, while Emil Novak 
defeated Davidson, 6-0 and 6-3 . 
Molden finished off Hong, 6-1 and 
6-4. 

"I definitely know our players 
tried hard, but I also know that we 
can play a bit better at certain 
sports," Steidlmayer said. "Give 
credit to Azusa [Pacific) for finding 
a way to win half the singles match-
es." 

From their disappointing 
upset, Steidlmayer felt the 
Tritons learned that although 
they are ranked 10th, they should 
not underestimate their oppo-
nents, especially if they are 
unranked . 

"We have to work hard to be 
good," Steidlmayer said. "We must 
respect , every opponent that we 
play. We expect to improve 
throughout the year and should do 
well as time goes on." . 

With that in mind, the Tritons 
look to redeem themselves at 
UCSD on Feb. 10 with its season 
home opener against Cal Poly 
Pomona and against Hawaii-Hilo 
on Feb. 11. The first serve is at 2 
p.m. for both matches at

C 0 began California 
Collegiate thletic ssoclao n 
play this week, plitting a double-
header with al tate Baker field 
on Feb. 6 and" sweeping a pair 
against Cal State tanislau on 
Feb. 7. 

The Tritons jumped out to a 
one-run lead in the fir t game 
against the Roadrunner when 
sophomore second baseman 
Desiree Franci cus broke up a 
pitchers' duel by cru hing her fir t 
career home run in the fifth 
inning. Cal State Bakersfield 
quickly regained the lead in the 
bottom of the sixth, however, 
when they hit up freshman pitcher 
Tina Rowe for two runs. 

UC 0 was not behind for 
long, however, when it launched a 
sixth-inning two-out rally that 
produced even runs. Franciscu 
grabbed a single to score fre hman 
pinch runner Dallas Hernandez, 
the fir t run of the inning, tying 
up the game at two. enior first

Meurer, bringing the game to its 
final score, 8-2 . 

"The team came out strong 
this weekend, we worked together, 
and have started off our ea on 
great," Franciscus said. "It's great 
how we pick each other up: I tried 
to pick up the team yesterday, and 
they picked me up today." 

Rowe once again reigned vic-
torious, notching up her third win 

of the sea on and her third com-
plete game of the eason, while 
only giving up two runs on even 

hj~. . 
"The fir t game was awesome," 

U SO head coach Patti Gercken 
said. "We started off with a home 
run, and even when they got two, 
we came back and scored even 
after that. It was a great game. We 
have worked on offen e all year 
long, and the girls are finally see-
ing the fruits of their labor." 

The second game of the series 
against the Roadrunners saw the 
Tritons falling at the hands of a 
tough 4-2 defeat. Cal State

Women's tennis-
sweeps season opener

After logging nearly 10,000 
miles in air travel over the past 
two weeks, the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team arrived in niversity 
Park, Penn., for the Penn State 
Invitational with an opportunity. 
The Tritons left with a split. 
UCSD dropped a 3-1 decision to 
defending national champion o. 
13 Lewis niver ity before 
rebounding to top the o. 11 

itta ny Lions of Penn tate, 3-2. 
UCSD is now 5-5 overall and 2-3 
in conference play. 

Coming off two tough 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation losses at Hawaii , the 
Tritons trekked a ro s the nation 
to Penn tate where the level of 
com petItIon remained high . 
Coming into the match with a 4-
5 reco rd , Lewis looked beatable, 
but CSD was unable to take 
adva ntage of the opportunity. 
Despi te hi tti ng just .114 in the 
first ga me, the Flyer grabbed a 
30-27 decision over the Tritons 
to take the early lead in the 
match. 

• SO appeared to shake off 
the jet lag in game two as it

pleting 22 kill s and only six errors 
on 37 attempts. Lewis was unable 
to respond with firepower of its 
own and the Triton crui ed to a 
30-22 victory. 

In game. three, however, the 
tables were turned a UC 0 was 
once aga in plagued by hitting 
errors on offense, and the Flyer 
were able to coast to a 30-23 win 

with an efficient attack that wa 
able to minimize critical mistakes. 

The fourth game proved to be 
the one that Lewis would need to 
put away the Triton , a II UCSD 
hitting errors foiled any hope the 
Tritons had of forcmg a deciding 
fifth game. The Flyers grabbed the 
game at 30-27 to end the match. 

Junior outside hitter Adam 
Toren and senior opposite Jim 
Waller shared team-high honors in 
kills with 15 apiece, while senior 
middle hitters Kevin Keyser and 
Andy Rupp added 10 each. Junior 
setter Nate Jones had 58 assists and 
jlmior libero ~ickens Tai added 16 
digs for UCSO. 

With Little rest for the weary, 
the Tritons returned to the court 
the following eVemJlg, Feb. 7, to 
take on tournament host Penn 
State. The Tritons proved their 
intention to be rude guests right 
away by stealing a tight game one 
at 35-33 by virtue of a strong .410 
attacking percentage compared to 
Penn State' .229. 

The ittany Lions were not to 
be embarras ed in front of a home 
crowd of 1,62 1, however, and 
Penn State roared back to grab 
game two, 30-26 .

T he UCSD women's tennis 
team wept A1lia nt International 
University of the National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics to win i~ 2003-04 season 
opener with a 9-0 non-conference 
win on Feb. 4. 

"The girls were very anxious to 
finally sta rt competition," head 
coach Liz LaPlante said. "They've 
been practicing all fall season and 
all through January, so they were 
eager to play some matches against 
another team." 

The women had no trouble 
defeating AIliant; senior Julie 
Westerman and sophomore Tara 
Siddiqui were able to quickly defeat 
their opponents, 8-0, at No. I dou-
bles, and junior Jasmin Dao teamed 
up with freshman Kristin 
Bronowicki to rout their opponenfS, 
8-2, at the No.2 doubles position. As 
for the singles matches, the girls 
were able to overwhelm AUiant in 
straight sets, dropping only one set 
in all ix single positions. 

"A1 liant was a good match for us 
to start off with," Dao aid. "They 
were a decent team and gave u 
some good practice; we learned 
what we needed to work on and our 

strengths. Plus, it was great that we 
were finaIJy able to start executing 
some of the techniques that we 
were learning in practice in a com-
petitive situation." 

T he team looked very sharp, 
allowing A1liant to win only 19 

poin~ and one set throughout the 
entire doubles and singles lineup. 
T he match allowed LaPlante to 
assess the team's roster as he tries 
to narrow down where to place 
players in the lineup, since it is such 
a large and talented team. 

"We have a large team this year 
with many of our big returners com-
ing back and some great talent from 
the freshmen," LaPlante said. "We 
have a lot of choices we can use in 
our lineup but it's hard because some 
of our great players don't get to play 
as !Duch as they would like to see." 

The team's strength definitely 
lies in its experience; the singles 
lineup is evenly matched, and each 
player adds some depth to the 
team. Many of the athletes have 
played competitively for many 
years, and the team ha many top 
returning players a well as some 
solid fre hmen to add to the roster. 

" it's great that we have an even-
ly matched lineup because some
