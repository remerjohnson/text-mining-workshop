UC Board wants a 
closer look into 
tobacco-funded 
research for colleges. 

By NediJ Oreizy 
SENIOR STAf f WRITER 

The UC Board of Regents post-
poned its decision to decide on Lt. 
Gov. and ex officio Regent Cruz 
Bustamante's proposal to ban tobacco-
funded research in UC schools, saying 
further discussion is necessary before a 
decision is finalized. 

Following Harvard University, 
Johns Hopkins University, the 
University of Washington and approxi-
mately II other institutions' example, 
Bustamante proposed the ban to the 
board last week as a discussion - not 
action - item on the agenda. 

It was an election-year move by 
Bustamante to bring the issue to the 
regents' discussion, which came after 
the release of a tobacco company-
funded research study by UCLA can-
cer epidemiologist James Enstrom, 
which was used to support the tobacco 
industry in recent court cases, UC 
Student Association Board of Directors 
Chair Brent Laabs said. 

However, regents have opted to 
postpone their decision and have asked 
the UC Academic Senate to "review 
and consider the proposal and report 
back to the regents at a later date," 
Dolores Davies, deputy director of 
University Communications at UCSD, 
stated in an e-mail. Bustamante has 
also been asked to bring a researcher 
to provide more information to the 
board, according to Laabs. 

Currently, the University of 
California has received approximate-
ly $29 million from tobacco-related 
companies for research, training and 
public service since 1995, according 
to Ellen R. Auriti, executive di.rector 
of Research Policy and Legislation at 
the Office of Research for the UC 
Office of the President. As significant 
as tlie figure may seem, the UC system 
received approximately $4 billion in 
total contracts and grants in fiscal year 
2005 alone. 

"This research amounts to approxi-
mately $850,000 - a miniscule amount 
considering that UCSD's research 
portfolio is more than $660 million," 
Davies stated in an e-mail. 

The main issue is that tobacco 
money "taints scientific scholarship 
and is bad business," according to 
Bustamante, as reported in the San 
Francisco Chronicle. He stated, "As 
regents, we have the responsibility to

SENIOR STAff WRITERS 

Allegations of mismanage-
ment and poor working condi-
tions have led to an internal audit 
of the UCSD Community Service 

Officer program, with former 
officers claiming that understaff-
ing and managerial issues have 
led to a massive increase in CSO 
resi ations over the paa year. , 

Two fonner CSOs, who agreed 
to speak to the Guardian only 
on the condition of anonym-
ity due to the sensitive nature 
of the allegations and cautions 
from the management not to 
speak to the media, claim that 
CSO Coordinator Peter Kim has 
made numerous ethically ques-
tionable decisions in his tenure as 

coordinator - including forcing 
employees to work beyond speci-
fied hours, forbidding divergent 
views, playing favorites and using 
university vehi les for personal 
transportation, including trips to 
the train station twice daily. 

Kim, who has resided in Irvine, 
Calif. , for about two years, com-
mutes to work, according to the 
former officers.

A year after UCSD commissioned 
one of its mo t comprehensive studies 
of undergraduate life ever. administra-
tors are lauding the analysiS' potential 
as a reference for campus improve· 
ment. 

While the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction report -
compiled by a team of faculty, student 
leaders, administrators and alumni 
- spurred some minor institutional 
changes since it was re.leased, admin-
istrators said, they are more impressed 
with its prospective use. 

"There have been some achieve-
ments we're proud of,' said Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs )0 eph 
W. Watson, U.S.E.S. committee's chair. 
"But we're looking for this to be a 
pivot point from which other depart-

Report: UC Student Mental Health Sh~rtchanged 
New systemwide study 
finds lack of funds and 
low staff~.ng levels have 
harmed psychological 
counseling services. 

By Serena Renna 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

A look into the University of 
California's mental health department 
found severe deficiencies in funding 
and service to students. 

The mental heahh study was pro-
.posed by UC President Robert C. 
Dynes last December in response to 
appeaJs from Victor and Mary Ojakian, 
the parents of UC Davis senior Adam 
Ojakian, who committed suicide on 
Dec. 17, 2004. 

Among many findings, the study 
discovered that the number of stu-
dents seeking psychological help has 
increased by over 50 percent in the 
last five years, with the complexity of 
cases dramatically rising. 

Campuses are left to juggle an 
increasing student demand with 
constant resources, according to 

SIOIIS 

NUMBER OF KNOWN UCSD SUICIDES AND TRANSFERS TO PSYCHIATRIC UNITS 

UCSD Psychological and Counseling 
Services Clinical Director Robert C. 
Mashman. 

The report highlights low staff-
ing levels as the underlying prob-
lem behind high specialist-to-student 
ratios, long wait times and limited 
access to specialists. 

YCSD has roughly 11.5 full time 
employees resulting in a ratio of one

psychologist to every 2.300 students, 
compared to the one to 1,500 ratio 
that the International Association of 
Counseling Services recommends, 
according to Mashman. 

"It is grandiose to believe that a 
staff of ll.s can take care of 27,000 
students," he said. 

The low staffing levels are a result 
of the 2003-04 budget cuts, Mashman 

said, which not only resulted in a 
$112,140 decrease and 15 percent 
overall reduction in the department's 
budget, but also a 50 percent loss of 
its staff. 

While employees received an 18 
percent raise the following year, they 
still remain 18 percent behind the

that Kim was aware that they were

"He would tell us to write [the

Kim declined to comment fur-

innocent of the charges. 

"There was an audit, but I was

Kim added that his supervisor 
allegedly told the auditing board 
members that they were "wasting

Council Q&A With Fox Brings 
Up SRIV, RSOs and Beer 

A star-studded recap of last year's 
major events greeted the new A .s. 
Council in its first meeting of the 
academic year, with appearances by 
ChanceUor Marye Anne Fox and 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. Ratcliff for discussion 
of several of last spring's hot-button 
issues. 

"Together, we can work on prob-
lems before they become problems;'

for a strong military is still there," 
Fox said. "I think it's important to 
give our students options, so they can 
learn more about the military and 
make an informed decision:' 

After a few more questions about 
general campus policy, Fox was off, 
leaving Ratcliff to observe silently 
from the audience.

the discussion of 
the council's reso-
lution to adhere to 
the Acceptable Use 

issues - Student-Run Television, the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction report, the 
Residential Security Officer program 
and Fox's favorite kind of beer. 

No, really. But Fox got sidetracked 
and expressed no preferred brand. 

"Would the chancellor agree that 
students deserve to be a part of [the] 
decision-making process at the uni-
versity?" Eleanor Roosevelt Senior 
Senator Erik Rodriguez-Palacios 
asked, in regard to the lack of student 
input on the recent RSO commit-
tee report. Fox answered her ques-
tions with candid laughter, pausing to 
compliment Rodriguez-Palacios on 
his new hairstyle before continuing. 

"I can't tell you how this hap-
pened, but I suspect that whatever 
happened during the summer - we 
obviously failed to provide the kind 
of representation [on the committee] 
that you need," she said. 

When asked how she felt about

was quick with a politically correct 
crowd-pleaser.

"While I don't like it, we're still forced

While some senators objected to

on them, the argument quickly fiz-
zled. 

"I think it's unfair to assume that 
any of our constituents would rather 
have a blue screen on channel 18 than

Sophomore Senator Lana Blank 
pointed out, before the resolution 
was passed 18-2-1-

The other resolution of the eve-
ning, a proposal for ~ alI -cam-

approved unanimously before Fox's 
arrival. However, Fox had no immedi-
ate answer for the council on whether 
or not it could be implemented.

However, according to the 
Chronicle, Enstrom said that if he 
allowed the tobacco company donors 
to influence his research, he would not 
have been able to keep his job at UCLA 
for 33 years. 

"It has certainly been true that 
tobacco money has tainted scientific 
scholarship in the past," Laabs said. 
"While I do not like the idea of tobac-
co industry-funded research gaining 
the legitimacy of the University of 
California, we must keep in mind the 
fact that tobacco is a fully legal prod-
uct and that ue researchers ultimately 
work for the university, not a tobacco 
company:' 

UCSD biology professor Darwin 
Berg's research, the only tobacco-
funded researcher at the university, 
is currently funded by three sources: 
the National Institute of Health, the 
Tobacco-Related Disease Research 
Program and Phillip Morris, and his 
research involves unde.rstanding the 
link between synapses and cognition, 
not tobacco or addiction. 

He said that Phillip Morris, the 
newest donor, would most benefit 
from the good public relations than 
from his research findings, and that the 
company has never had any impact on 
his research. 

According to Berg, the ban may 
result in a few layoffs and tobacco com-
panies would have to take their money 
elsewhere. 

"Who in society will be better off?" 
he said. "Outlaw the behavior, not the 
gathering of information."

LETTERS TO 
THE EDITOR 

Potential UC Ban on Big Tobacco Funding Misguided 
Writing Center Helpful 

to Warren Students 
Dear Editor, 

By Nathan Miklos 
OPINION EDITOR 

A contlict of interest may 
not always be what it seems. 
Consider the case of Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante. 

It is only when financial leverage is 
allowed to influence the outcome 
of that research that we should be 
concerned. 

And Bustamante's example may 
be a good one. The UCLA study 
!lies in the face of a swarm of 
research showing exactly the oppo-
site: Secondhand smoke is classified 
as iI Class A "known human car-
cinogen' by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, the U.S. National 
Toxicology Program and the World 
Health Organization. 

Critics of the UCLA study have 
pointed out serious methodological 
flaws, such as 

sion to run the piece. 
"I couldn't have lasted for 33 

years at UCLA if I was some sort of 
corrupt tool of the tobacco indus-
try," he told the Chronicle. "The 
whole notion of the university 
is to allow researchers to pursue 
research in the way they feel it is 
appropriate. [Bustamante) is not 
entitled to take away my right to do 
legitimate research and publish it 
in peer research journals. It is more 
the principle than it is the amount 
of funding:' 

Enstrom has a point. Should 
the regents, using a project's fund-

ing source, 

In his Sept. 25 Guardian column 
addressing studeni boredom at UCSD, 
Nathan Miklos suggests that students 
create a "writing workshop and editing 
service, to help out all those who strug-
gle through writing-heavy GEs:' It may 
interest Mr. Mildos to know that the 
Warren College Writing Center, which 
has heen in existence since the spring of 
2005, supports Warren students work-
ing 00 writing assignments for any 
UCSD course. Undergraduate writing 
mentors offer assistance at all stages of 
the writing process. from brainstorm-
ing for ideas to polishing final drafts. 
For more information on the Warren 
Writing Center, check out the college 
Web site or contact Writing Center 
Coordinator Madeleine Picciotto at 
mpicciottO@Ucsd.edu. 

During his tenure as a state 
assemblyman between 1993 and 
1999, Bustamante accepted nearly 
$80,000 from tobacco interests, 
according to a Sept. 19 report in 
the San Francisco Chronicle. Now, 
as an ex officiO regent, Bustamante 
will cast one of 26 votes deciding 
whether the University of California 
will ban the use of research funding 
from tobacco companies. With his 
past financial ties to Big Tobacco, 
shouldn't we be worried about a 
conOict of interest?

Maybe not. Interestingly, 
Bustamante is one of the loudest 
supporters of the tobacco-funds 
ban, having spent the past few 
weeks urging his fellow regents to 
climb aboard. Arguing that scien-
tific integrity suffers when indus-
tries sponsor research on subjects 
in which they have a vested inter-
est, Bustamante cited a 2003 UCLA 
study - paid for in part by the 
tobacco industry - that concluded 
previous estimates overstated the 
likelihood that secondhand smoke 
causes lung cancer. 

Bustamante's condemnation of 
tobacco-funded research - despite 
his past acceptance of substantial 
contributions from tobacco com-
panies - raises an Interesting 
question: Does an apparent "con-
tlict of interest" necessarily com-
promise the integrity of the parties 
involved? 

Certainly there's nothing inher-
ently wrong with tobacco compa-
nies funding university research. 
There's nothing inherently wrong. 
even, when those funds are used to 
research tobacco-related subjects. 

--(is and tbeir 
nonsmoking 
spouses, who 
are presumed 
to have signifi-
cant exposure 
to second-hand 
smoke. There is no data on the 
smoking habits of the sample 
group past 1972 - but the study 
measures causes of death for the 
sample group through 1998. In 
that 26-year period, did the test 
group smoke more, smoke less or 
even quit smoking altogether? Did 
any of the nonsmokers divorce or 
separate from their partners, sig-
nificantly reducing their level of 
exposure? The UCLA study doesn't 
say. 

Study author James Enstrom 
defended his research, noting that 
the editor of the British Medical 
Journal, where the study was first 
published, still stands by his deci-

Clearly, the 
litmus test of a 
research pro-

gram should not be the source 
of funding for a project, but the 
quality of research produced. Does 
a study follow rigorous scientific 
methodology? Has it been thor-
oughly reviewed and evaluated by a 
relevant community of peers? 

And then there's another con-
sideration: Why ban only tobacco 
companies? Why not prohibit fund -
ing from, say, the pharmaceutical 
industry, which provides an esti-
mated 70 percent of the nationwide 
funding for clinical drug studies?

and others - gave over $20 mil-
lion to a national Alzheimer's 
research program, about two-thirds 
of which was directed to UCSD. 
Also in 2004, pfizer gave UCSD 
$500,000 in equipment, as well as 
$200,000 to finance an undergrad -
uate molecular synthesis course. 
AstraZeneca has helped foot the 
bill for several UCSD pediatrics 
research programs. 

These contributions to UCSD 
alone far surpass the roughly $2 .9 
million a year in funding thai the 
University of California receives 
from tobacco companies. And 
perhaps that's why funding from 
tobacco companies is the only log 
currently on the -chopping block 
- compared to the UC system's 
$4 billion annual research budget, 
$2.9 million is chump change. 

And Bustamante, who has his-
torically been supportive of tobacco 
interests, has found his anti-tobac-
co stump conspicuously close to 
this November's election, in which 
he is running for insurance com-
missioner. Curious. 

With an increasingly limited 
pool of funds to draw from, the 
University of California cannot 
afford to turn down research grants 
from the corporate sector. But nei-
ther can it afford to compromise 
its intellectual integrity, which is 
at the heart of the university's mis-
sion. 

Fortunately, the two are not 
mutually exclusive. Focusing on 
the quality of research instead of 
the funding source - with special 
attention to rigorous methodology 
and extensive peer review - is the 
only sure way to produce useful, 
accurate science. 

And truthfully speaking, are 
the tobacco company reports 
really fooling anyone? The regents 
shouldn't even bother with this 
one.

Budget Cuts Overwhelmed Mental Health Dept. 
• HEALTH, from page 1 
average salary (or surrounding hospi-
tals, according to Mashrnan. 

"We were completely out of the 
ballpark; Mashman said. "That's why 
they left." 

In response to understaffing, cam-
puses must direct immediate resources 
to those students in crisis, the report 
said, undermining the ability to 
respond to more "traditional" prob-
lems, including homesickness, iden-
tity issues, relationship problems and 
career choice issues. 

Although they are the largest popu-
lation served, students dealing with 
normal developmental issues may have 
to wait up to three weeks to see a coun-
selor, Mashman said. 

The study also found that gradu-
ate students are at a higher risk, with 
almost 50 percent revealing emotional, 
stress-related problems, according to 
the UC Berkeley Graduale Student 
Mental Health Survey. 

The increased financial need has 
not gone unnoticed, according to 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee 
Chair Garo Bournoutian. Student 
affairs granted $62,694 in resources to 
the cash-strapped department. 

Still, the impact of the budget cut 
has not been remedied, Mashman said. 
With shallow funds, the center has 
chosen to emphasize preventive ser-
vices, including training for resident 
advisers, house advisers and college 
deans along with outreach programs, 
Mashman said. 

According to a UC Berkeley study, 
80 percent of student respondents who 
have considered suicide have never 
sought help at the campus counseling 
center. 

"When these numbers are so low, 
how do you prevent them?" Mashman 
said. "How do you prevent two out 
of 27,000 students from taking their 
lives? In most cases, we have had no 
contact with them. Frequently they 
don't say anything:' 

While the report details the extent 
of the problem facing the UC system, it 
doesn't offer many solutions. 

"It's saying 'Boy, something really 
needs to be done,"' Mashman said. 

An equally pressing challenge 
for the center is the limited funds 
in the Student Affairs budget, which 
funds the department but also pro-
vides money for services that improve 
the campus climate - an aspect that 

goes hand in hand with mental health, 
Mashman said. 

Almost every program is running 
with either inadequate -staff support 
or insufficient money for programs, 
Bournoutian said. 

One suggestion has been to increase 
registration fees, which support sev-
eral aspects of student life including 
psychological and counseling services. 
The fee has remained relatively stag-
nant for 17 years, rising only $171 
since 1987. This amounts to a 34 per-
cent loss when inflation is considered. 
the report said. 

The current situation may not be 
the "crisis" the media has made it out 
to be, Mashman said. 

The need is a few hundred thou-
sand dollars to fund sufficient staff at 
adequate salaries. 

·Our employees bust their asses off 
and get burnt out;' he said. "We just 
need more people to help~ 

The report is currently under 
review by the Board of Regents and 
Student Affairs to formulate a proper 
response.

Student Leaders Scoff at Work Group's Findings 
• REPORT, from page 1 
by the U.S.B.S. steering committee, an 
offshoot of the original U.S.B.S. group 
that identified more specific ways to 
improve student life. 

The original U.S.E.S. report stressed 
an overarching campus culture that 
is "legalistic," which became a con· 
centration for the steering commit-
tee. A workgroup was commissioned 
to investigate student discontent with 
residential security officers brought to 
light by the committee. 

Earlier this year the workgroup 
released its report, which linked the 

bitterness between RSOs and students 
to campus policies as well as student 
perceptions of the officers. The RSO 
department, the report stated, institu-
tionally possesses duties that conflict 
with students' desires. Student lead-
ers, however, found the workgroup's 
findings one-sided. In a letter sent to 
Watson. A.S. President Harry Khanna 
and others lampooned the workgroup's 
recommendations. which included 
increasing the number of exams on 
Fridays to reduce unlawful behavior. 

"By placing blame squarely on the 
students in this manner, we are losing 

confidence that the issues raised in the 
U.S.E.S. report will ever be addressed; 
they stated in the letter. While there 
have been tangible impacts from the 
report, Watson said, committee mem-
bers are realistic about its reach. 

For example, Watson said while the 
group recommended a guarantee of 
four-year on-campus housing, fund-
ing deficits at the school and at the UC 
level make the suggestion unlikely to 
be adopted.

Kim Points to 
Other Factors for 

Turnover Rate 
• AUDIT, from page 2 

UCSD Police Lt. David Rose, 
Kim's supervisor, also declined to 
speak about the audit because it 
pertained to an active member of 
the police department. 

According to Kim, officer resig-
nations did not appear to be more 
frequent than in years past, and 
a certain number of CSOs leave 
the program each year when they 
graduate or otherwise leave the uni-
versity. 

"I can't say it was the most [offi-
cers) we've ever lost, or the least 
we've ever lost;' Kim said. "This 
is a student job. The population is 
transient. We lose people every year 
no matter how much they love the 
job." 

The former CSOs, on the other 
hand, put the brunt of the blame on 
Kim. with the first former C50 say-
ing that several C50s attempted to 
have Kim investigated by the UCSD 
Police Department as early as fall 
quarter 2004. 

"We had a petition going around 
to have [Kim) investigated, but 
unfortunately at that time he was 
beginning to hire people and many 
of the current C50s felt that if they 
Signed, they would get fired," the 
first ex-CSO stated in an e-mail. 

The second ex-CSO agreed. 
going so far as to directly connect 
Kim's alleged mismanagement to the 
high turnover rate. 

"Peter Kim was the reason peo-
ple qUit," the ex-officer said. 

Kim said that the program hires 
new officers once a year in fall quar-
ter, and has approximately 50 C50s 
on the staff when hiring is complete. 
By the end of the year, it may often 
fluctuate by 20 to 30 students, he 
said. 

Alternatively, the lack of CSO 
applications can partially be attrib-
uted to some applicants not under-
standing the job. Kim said. 

"We've had a lot apply on miscon-
ceptions," he said, adding that appli-
cations are now only accepted after a 
mandatory information session. 

Sixth College sophomore and 
CSO Officer-in-Charge David 
Challman agreed that understaff-
ing is currently a problem, but also 
called the problem seasonal. 

"We have lower staffmg than we 
would like, but that's typical for 
fall quarter," Challman said. "I don't 
schedule people for more shifts than 
they want. If they want one shift a 
week, that's what they get:' 

ChaJlman added that. minimally, 
three CSOs, a dispatcher and an 
OIC are supposed to be on night 
duty, but at the moment, the pro-
gram's staffmg level only allows for 
two on-duty CSOs. 

Due to the nature of the job and 
the officers' duties to monitor cam-
pus safety, both sides agree that CSO 
morale and the dedication of the 
officers pose a continual concern for 
the university. 

"I enjoy it, and I think most people 
do," Challman said. "From what I've 
heard. this group is the most cohesive 
in a long time." 

Despite the allegations, Kim 
believes the morale of the officers is 
high, stressing that CSOs often come 
to him and express their love for the 
job, 

"Many students who graduate tell 
me they wish it would be available as 
an outside position," Kim said. "They 
have the strong belief that they're mak-
ing a difference:' 

However, the second CSO dis-
agreed with Kim's positive mterpreta-
tion of the program, noting that C"OS 
always try to work with dediCltion but 
are hindered by unreasonable manage-
ment policies. 

"It's a reaDy good program, but it's 
not benefiting the students as much as 
it should," the ex -officer said.

.!J f I have to sit through another photomontage of Ono!Lennon . cuddle shots and 'Nam protest rallies, it better be leading up to some damn sharp conspiracy juice. This tease of a film title dares to suggest an undiscovered vault of answers (or at least 
some new questions) concerning one of the I1lOIt talked-about pubtic 
figures of the century_ Unfortunately, every time "The US_ VI. John 
Lennon" seems hot on the trail, it shies from the \lDaIlSWI!n!d and 
focuses on trying to cover as many aspects of the era (1967-1980) as 
possibJe, regressing to a scattered mess of tired, obvious biopaphy 
without the dirt to warrant yet another grave-cIlsturbi 

WritersldirectorsTproducers David Leaf and John Scheinfeld 
do begin to uncover the little-told story of Lennon', near deporta-
tion as an illegal alien by the Nixon administration, especially FBI 
villain J. Edgar Hoover. However. the filmmakers don't have much 
to offer, save for amusing dips of John and Yoko in court declar-
ing themselv.es part of sovereign nation -Utopia.- But I want some 
inSight into the government's suspicions and inner workinp. and 
will not be satiated by one lefty's simplified explanation ("they 
were nervous') and some defensive commentary from • certain 
senile G. Gordon Liddy, of Waterglte infamy, Why was the preli-
dent so urgently trying to remove Lennon from the country? And 
what finally spooked the fearless activist into not appearin& in the 
protest concert outside Miami'. ~lican convention? . 

In some ways. Lennon was a complicated thinker of gmt wit and 
energy; on the other hand. the message he worked his whole life to 
get across was starkly simple (or, as many would say. Daift). 1'hII

I Lost All My 
Music and 

That Fucking 
Blows 

The whole "back your shit up' spiel given by my external hard drive manual upon purchase in 
a language quite foreign and unim -
portant to me at the time makes a lot 
more sense now - in fact, it haunts 
my existence with a blinding logic I 
once didn't bother to acknowledge, 
thus ruining life as I knew it. 

Don't withdraw your pity just 
yet: I'm not the girl pressing the 
monitor's logo instead of the power 
button, or losing my 12-page essay 
because I was too stupid to press 
save; in fact, I would consider myself 
rather computer savvy. But that 
doesn't save me from an average 
chronic laziness and general putting-
off of things that should never be put 
off - say, backing up the 100+ GB 
of music I've spent my life amassing.

a universe of possible solutions.

Yo La Tengo 
• I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass 
MATADOR RECORDS 

*** For its latest album, this three-decade old indie band pumps out nothing new, but does so with characteristic vigor and good 
charm that, at best, makes a good iPod filler. 

The opening lO-minute-plus guitar jam 
"Pass the Hatchet, I Think I'm Goodkind" 
seems determined to sonica1ly describe its title, 
roaring authentic, shoulder-swaggering rock-
and-roU that lovers of Yo La Tengo will adore for 
Ira Kaplan's uber-cool distortion. Others may 
hate it for its unexpected riffs that paradoxicaUy, 
like a favorite wool sweater, sooth and scratch. 

"Beanbag Chair" foUows, a total sleep-lull-
ing turnaround from the mean guitar strokes of 
the intro. The rest sounds a bit more like Yo La 
Tengo as we've known them in their recent past: 
classic piano chords, distant but jazzy singing

• The White Buffalo EP 
THE WHITE BUffAlO 

Native American legends of the Northern Plains teU us that if you treat a white buffalo with respect, he will bring you peace and 
prosperity. The chances of a white buffalo birth, 
however, are about one in a million - and given 
that only 250.000 buffalos roam the United 
States today, our odds are even slimmer. 

Despite aU this, one white baby buffalo was 
born last month in Wisconsin. attracting thou-
sands of people traveling thousands of miles to see 
him and make their offerings. What's even better 
- or at least more convenient - is that you can 
pay your respects to the White Buffalo every day 
if you wish. No pilgrimage necessary. Just buy a 
copy of his recently released self-titled EP. 

A certain mountain man, going by day-name 
Jake Smith and choosing the white buffalo as his 
totem animalJstage character. will certainly bring 
you prosperity and peace (if only for the eve-

and the tranquilizing luU of trombones and vio-
lin strings. The simple lyrics of "Black Flowers· 
("You never sleep enough! Your alarm is going 
off! You wake up and you can't pretend the 
dream is just a dream again") is almost a tribute 
to Elliot Smith in its taste for sorrow, and "The 
Story of Yo La Tengo· yields a magical unfolding 
of instruments.

recite "I am not afraid of you and I will beat your

ning) . The quake of his voice is a persuasive invi-
tation to break through whatever waUs the day 
has raised. Add to this thunder some surprisingly 
delicate acoustic melodies and ceaseIessly raw, 
lonely love lyrics. and Smith has conquered the 
art of the foik song. In "Love Song 'I," the second 
of six tracks, he rumbles, " Til you blew in just 
like paper in the wind! I just wanted somethin' to 
believe in! I just want you on my arm, every limb! 
Carry on with you right down to the bitter end" 
It would be difficult not to stay with him, too. all 
the way through - in the realms offolk rock. this 
buffalo might be one in a million.

Boot Camp Clik 
• The last Stand 
DUCK DOWN 

**** 

Mile-wide swarms of hip-hop alliances, affil-iates and supergroups often result in the louder/pushier overshadowing the better. 
Through the clatter, though, the Boot Camp 
Clik umbrella has preserved a solid clump of mic 
monsters with retro-military flows untouched 
by the rest, under the radar but still near enough 
to the surface to allow accessibility. 

This Brooklyn -seasoned block of talent 
- boasting such innards as Smif-N-Wessun , 
O.G.c., Buckshot of Black Moon and Sean 
Price (the latter two enjoying well -deserved 
21st-century solo success) - now revamp the 
simplistic '90s beauty of steadily hammer-
ing wily wordplay, knee-bobbin' beats, party 
whistles and carefully looped brown sugar. 

Of the three 9th Wonder-produced tracks, 
only one too closely rides his typical orchestral , 
sweeping rise'and-faU formula, while Large 
Professor effortlessly pumps out the best sam-
ple-Iaiden backdrop on the album. Marco Polo's 

jumpy pulse is the least experimental , but a 
well -made, danceable beat can't be argued with 
just because it lacks invention. III Mind, Pete 
Rock and others add to the all -star production 
lineup, slapping the on-guard MCs around a 
little for one hell of a showdown. "The arm 
bone connected to the hand bone/ Nigga, the 
hand bone connected to the damn chrome:' 
grunts monkey-man Price over echOing, dusty-
high piano keys courtesy of Sic Beats. 

It's been too long since a hip-hop record 
fresh out the studio made this girl's pace quick-
en like it did during the early days of discovery. 
Boot Camp Clik will take even the most jaded 
headphoner back to the days when beats and 
raps ruled the streets and the art was still raw, 
at the same time setting the flawlessly gritty 
standard of the future.

My Fatal 
Misconception 
of the Digital 

Song as Immortal 
• WILSON, from page 10 
matter of seconds. Though upon 
further recall, it was probably a pro-
cess worn by time, as I don't exactly 
handle my equipment as gracefully 
as J might. Okay, you can have your 
pity back. 

Every bleary new day following 
that awful discovery would bring 
back the innocence of pre-trage-
dy routine: Open ilunes, pick out 
something really groovy I can bang 
in my sleep-sharpened ears, double 
click the little devil and - a fuck-
ing exclamation point encircled in a 
gray the shade of my darkest night-
mares appears where the . blaring 
speaker icon should be. 

"The song could not be used 
because the original file could not 
be found. Would you like to locate 
it?- No thankJ, ilunes, but as you so 
kindly just reminded me, that fLle is 
gone forever into the black hole of. 
my once snazzy Seagate, imprisoned 
in a state of compressed micro-data 
I cannot even begin to understand . 

J suppose my brain has adjusted 
to the loss of an all -music-I-could-
ever-want-at -my-fingertips lifestyle, 
because now upon waking my first 
instinct is to pull out that dusted -off 
stereo that's outlived every electronic 
I've trustingly leaned my life upon, 
pop the lid and start from track 
one. It's a pleasantly simple exis-
tence, really, one I sometimes try to 
tell myself I could learn to love. But 
Lord knows I don't physically own 
every CD in my electronic archives, 
and sometimes when you've got to 
have the entire Beatles discography 
at your beck and call, there's just no 
other road to happiness. 

Now that I've ripped open the 
unhealed gashes of my shriveled heart 
and you've neared the end of this 
irrelevant sob story, III like to make 
some sort of point - aside from the 
one about me being 99 percent stupid, 
unappreciative, flawed human matter. 

The point, I believe (though I'd 
rather not bother with it for long), 
deals with the effect music's newly 
invisible form has on way we perceive 
and treat our coUections. It was as if 
some higher being (whom I've discov-
ered was just a flawed, extremely mor-
tal, fancy-looking box) held my most 
precious half in imperishable safety 
- as if since I could not see or feel it, 
the music was in a much better place. 

Sometimes, when I want to really 
revel in my newfound state of perma-
nent depreSSion, I think about send-
ing a dumpster full of 2,000 jewel-
cased compact discs plunging down 
a jagged cliff to crash into a million 
tiny rainbow slivers at the bottom. 
To stab extra deep, I occasionaUy 
imagine them as richly musty, ebony-
black records breaking with resonat-
ing cracks. Because this is, in essence, 
what I have done. I guess those hori-
zontal song strips on my screen just 
don't strike me in the same way, 
seeming neither delicately valuable 
nor needing to be preserved. 

I'll keep on trudging along, pick-
ing up new music and some old 
stuff I didn't notice before, And, 
as much as J still don't want to 
accept that the mistake has reached 
a state of completion so fully that it 
should now be learned from, these 
CDs probably won't find themselves 
strewn across the mud mats of my 
car and the freshly imported mp3s 
on my computer may just end up 
burned onto backup DVDs. 

On the other hand, maybe I'll 
convince my parents that a few 
thousand hard -earned dollars is 
nothing compared to the restora-
tion of my possession-starved soul 
(I've heard any drive can be restored 
ifthe pay is high' enough). That way, 
I can go on living my wrecking-ball 
lifestyle and avoiding logical manu-
al, and other such complicated con-
veniences that clutter an otherwise 
carefree horizon.

goal apiece when Viking forward 
Gus Zadra beat freshman goalkeeper 
Joshua Vasquez. 

But Choi and the rest of the 
Tritons refused to walk off the field 
with anything less than a win and 
struck again in the 80th minute. Choi 
took a ball from Moreira 15 yards out 
and snuck another goal by freshman 
goalkeeper Christian Warman. Choi. 
a newcomer from Folsom. Calif., has 
proven to be a force to be reckoned 
with in his first collegiate season, con-
necting four times. 

"U's sometimes tough to score in 
our 4-5·1 formation, but I just try and 
play hard and take my chances when 1 
am given the opportunity." Choi said. 

The Tritons will need Choi and 
the rest of the team to be in top form 
as they return home for a brief home 
stand. beginning with CCAA defend -
ing champions Sonoma State on Sept. 
29 at 4:30 p.m. The Tritons will look 
to avenge last year's loss to Sonoma

and 75. respectively. 

"We showed our potential in the 
second round with a one-over-par 
289," Bailey said. "Unfortunately, we 
also showed that we are a young team 
in the fi rst round." 

UCSD improved two spots to lOth 
with stellar afternoon play while tour-
nament host Western Washington 
University grabbed a three-stroke lead 
over Cal State Bakersfield. The Vtkings 
fired a 276. eight strokes better than 
the next best second-round score. 

During day two. the Tritons cooled 
off, shooting a 309 for a team total of 
908. placing the team 11th. 

Bailey supported his exceUent first

for 23rd overall with a three· round 
total of 221 , 18 strokes behind med-

a�ist Brady Baguio from Cal State

Western Washington University 
defended its title on its home course, 
shooting a steady 287 for a two-day 
total of 854, five strokes better than 
second-place Cal State Bakersfield 

"We were disappointed with the 
overall performance, but we played 
weU in the second round," bead coach 
Mike Wydra said. "It's hard to be con-
sistent when we had one day of class. 
then our first team meeting and then a 
plane ride to our first tournament. All 
the other competitors had nearly three 
weeks of classes before the invitational 
and it was a huge advantage:' 

According to Bailey, the players 
from last year now have the experience 
to compete at a hlgber level and lead 
the younger players. 

"We're a very young team, but we 
learned a lot last year," Bailey said. "We 
learned how to manage our games on 
the golf course and we hope to put that 
into effect this year." 

Bailey added that he expects to 
see a large improvement as the year

"This is the first week and we till 
have some obvious work to do," Bailey 
said. "We have the ability and skill and

Tritons Come Up 
mpty on Road Trip 

By Brent Westcott 
TAFF WRITER 

In any sport, finding wins on the 
r ad can prove to be a difficult chal-
lenge. The UCSD men's soccer team, 
unfortunately, is finding this time-test-
ed sporting fact out the hard way. After 
an inlpressive 2-0 win against Western 
Washington University at home on 
Sept. 20, the Tritons dropped their 
next two matches on the road against 
( al State Bakersfield and Cal State Los 
\ ngeles with identical scores of 2-0. 
. e Tritons' ,record fell to 6-3-1 over-
II and 4-2-1 in California Collegiate 
\thletic Association play. Despite the 

I oor road play, UCSD still sits atop 
the CCAA South Division, maintain-
I'lg a narrow lead over Cal State Los 
Angeles. 

In their most recent match against 
l al tate Los Angeles on Sept. 24, the 
I ritons fell victim to their inability to 
tlnish scoring chances. UCSD outshot 
the Golden Eagle 11 -10 and took six 
more corner kicks, but failed to put 
a.ny balls in the back of the net. Despite 
UCSD's inability to score goals, fresh-
man mid fielder Tony Choi did not 
blame the team's offensive effort for 
the loss. 

"We just hit a dry pell after playing 
well offensively," Choi said. "We had 
ou r chances but just could not finish:' 

Forward Morten Marthisen put the 
Golden Eagles on top early on, scor-
ing the first of his two goals only 10 
minutes into the match. He added 
another in the 87th minute, when the 
Triton were forced to step up their 
offensive intensity. Choi gave credit to 
Marthisen and the Golden Eagles for 
taking control early. 

"We made orne uncharacteristic 
defensive mistakes and they were able 
to take advantage of that:' Choi said. 

In their first road match of the 
CCAA season, the Tritons were trav-
eled to Cal State Bakersfield, which 
boasted an undefeated home record 
of 4-0-0 going into the match. ~CSD 
fought hard but was unable to score 
the key road win, losing the match 2-
O. The Roadrunners got second-half 
goals from forward Towa Manda and 
defender Javier Barba, and played 
strong defense to ensure the home 
victory. 

"Playing on the road is always 
tough because the other team is used 
to playing on their home field all the 
time," Choi said. 

The hostile environment, coupled 
with the Tritons' offensive ineptitude, 
led to their eventual demise. 

"We failed to execute our game 
plan, which made it even tougher to 
win on the road:' Choi said. 

Before UCSD embarked on its 
road trip, the team looked to take 
care of business at home against 
Western Washington University at 
the Triton Soccer Stadium on Sept. 
20. The Tritons featured a suffocating 
defense, but the real difference again 
proved to be Choi, who scored his 
first goal of the match seven minutes 
in, giving the Tritons the early lead. 
Senior forward Mark Moreira played 
a crossing shot that sophomore mid-
fielder Jonathan Sawyer flicked into 
the left side of the box, where Choi 
was waiting and finished the play 
off. Western Washington University 
was able to even the score at one

Women's Soccer Seizes CCAA South First Place Men's Golf 
Ends Tourney 
in 11 th Place 

By icky Buchanan 
A SSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR . 

It is one thing to win a game 
and another to dominate it, and it is 
safe to say that the UCSD women's 
soccer team did just that in its game 
against rival Cal State Los Angeles on 
ept. 25. With a 4-0 shutout victory, 

the Tritons grabbed the No. 1 spot 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association's South Division. 

"It feels good to beat a dirty 
team on their home field where we 
had never won before:' senior mid-
fielder Kelly Cochran said. 

The girls were up against some 
very tough odds, but they predicted 
the challenges they faced, and over-
came them on the field. 

"We knew that their field does 
not allow us to pass as easily and 
accurately as we are used to because 
it is mounded and bumpy in areas;' 
sophomore goalkeeper Jessica 
McGovern said. "We also knew that 
they like to foul and take dives, 
emphatically falling over when one 
of us taps them to convince the 
referee, and we also dealt with their 
aggression by surpassing them with 
intensity and determination:' 

The passion of the battle came 
out clear as both teams remained 
scoreless going into halftime - not 
unusual for UCSD, which has tend-
ed to be a second-half team in the 
past. The team proved it yet again 
by earning all four of its goals after 
the break. 

Senior mid fielder Megan Dickey 
took the initiative by earning the 
first goal for the Tritons just two 
minutes into the second half on 
a pass from junior forward Kathy 
Sepulveda. 

"[Co hran] played a long ball 
past the defense deep into the 
left corner for me to run onto," 
Sepulveda said. "I got there first as

The Tritons have taken the place of Cal State Los Angeles in the No. I spot in the CCAA South Division after keeping the GOlden Eagles 
scoreless during their match on Sept. 24, scoring allfour goals in the second half. 

the defense and our players crashed 
the box anticipating the cross. 
[Dickey] held her run and screamed 
for the ball, so I took a look, saw she 
was open at the top of the box and I 
played her a ball which popped up 
on the bumpy field. Thankfully, she 
followed through and her touch put 
it away." 

Despite her excitement about 
the goal, Dickey admitted, however, 
that the first goal may have given the 
team a fal e sense of security. 

"I feel that we got overconfident 
to an extent:' Dickey said. "We broke 
down a little after that and it took 
some time to reorganize our style of 
play and get comfortable again:' 

Junior midfielder Chelsea 

Campbell delivered the second goal 
just 28 minutes later with a shot past 
the Cal State Los Angeles goalie. 
Thanks to the joint effort of senior 
forward Alise Malley, who sent 
Campbell the pass the Tritons leat 
ahead to a 2-0 lead. . 

The fmal points were both tal -
lied by Cochran in the 84th minute 
on a pass from junior midfielder 
Lauren Segars and the 88th minute 
on a penalty kick. 

"I think our most solid attribute 
in the game was that each player 
who stepped on the field focused on 
their individual jobs;' Cochran said. 
"We played as a team all over the 
field and showed some urgency and 
desire from the start." 

After advancing their record 
to an impressive 8-1-1 overall and 
5-1- 1 in CCAA play, the Tritons 
return home for two more impor-
tant games against Sonoma State on 
Sept. 29 at 7 pm and Humbolt State 
at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 1. 

"Sonoma State is the team that is 
first place in North Division at the 
moment and they have two points 
more than us in and are first over-
all in the CCAA, so this is looking 
like a civil war, North vs. South," 
McGovern said. "We are also not 
overlooking Humboldt. It seems 
that when you are the top team, 
every game is huge because all the 
teams beneath you are gunning for 
you."
