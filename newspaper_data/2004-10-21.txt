Student Health to 
limit flu vaccines 

BiIy Wong/(illlltdan 
Shot down: Due to a national flu vaccine shortage, UCSD Student Heahh Services 
has already turned away 25 students for vaccines. 

By ANGELA VAG 
Contributing Writer 

In response to a national flu vac-
cine shortage, UCSD Student 
Health Services is making flu 
immunizations available only to 
those who are in priority groups 
defined by the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, according 
to campus administrators. 

"We're following CDC and San 
Diego Health Departments' guide-
lines," Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Health and Wellness Brian 
MWTily said. "We're giving the shots 
to those identified as high risk. " 

Priority groups include six- to 
23-month-old babies, adults over 
65, pregnant women, people with 
chronic medical conditions and 
health care workers with direct 
patient contact, according to a 
CDC statement. National health 
authorities have said that those who 
do not fall into the priority groups 
should not receive the vaccine. 

Student Health Services has 
turned away about 25 students, 
with 125 flu doses administered so 
far, according to Murray. 

"We have to screen everyone 
who comes in to make sure they're 
in the high-risk group," said Brad 
Buchman, clinical director of 
Student Health Services. "We real-
ly do need to vaccinate these people 
in this group." 

The shortage began Oct. 5 
when Chiron, the company provid-
ing half of the country's influenza 

vaccines, notified the CDC that 
none of its flu vaccines would be 
available for this year's flu season, 
according to a CDC statement. 

British health authorities shut 
down Chiron's Liverpool factory 
for three months, preventing the 
release of any of its flu vaccine sup-
ply. The British Medicine and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency released a statement that 
cited concerns over possible conta-
mination at the facility. 

Aventis Pasteur, the only other 
major supplier of flu shots in the 
United States, estimated it would 
malce 58 million doses available this. 
flu season. 

"Ei ghty-seven million [ doses) 
were given last year, but no one 
really knows how many people in 
the high-risk group needed it," said 
Michael Petruccelli, vice president 
of business development.at Mission 
Valley Medical Clinic, a local 
provider of the vaccine. 

Petruccelli said this year is 
"insane because of the shortage," 
compared to the previous eight 
years the clinic provided flu shots. 

"[We are) significantly impact-
ed, because [if] doctors are sending 
in [people who are] high risle, then 
our patients can't get in, so they're 
mad at us," he said. 

Part of the problem is that man-
ufacturers cannot make additional 
flu vaccines because they do not 
have a shelf life past the season,

Watson to $eek TV policy clarity 
Aguilar appointed chair of media committee 

By CHAILES NGUYEN 
Contributing Writer 

In response to multiple com-
munication conflicts last year with 
student-run media, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson has created a 

- committee to coordinate policies 
of closed-circuit television sta-
tions on campus. The decision has 
in turn raised concerns among 
some students and A.S. leaders. 

Closed Circuit TV Stations 
Governance members will "review 
the mission, governance and oper-
ations statements and guidelines 
for the college and ASUCSD 
campus television stations and dis-
cuss, with those responsible' for 
each of the stations, changes in the 
guidelines needed to make [them) 
explicitly clear," according to the 
committee's official description. 

"My vision for this comminee 
is that it clarifies what are the gov-
erning structures for the c1osed-
circuit television stations and 

detennine how content is gov-
erned," Watson said. "I think this 
is extremely important. We often 
end up in circumstances in which 
there is controversy over content, 
and there's not clarity over who 
was responsible." 

One such circumstance 
occurred in May, when UCSD 
Healthcare shut down the broad-
cast of Student-Run Television for 
almost four days in response to 
patient complaints that obscene 
material was aired on Thornton 
Hospital televisions. 

SRTV managers said they still 
do not know whether the mater-
ial was part of regular program-
ming or if a break-in at the sta-
tion occurred because hospital 
administrators refused to explain 
what they saw. 

"The fact that an entity outside 
of UCSD shut us off was disheart-
ening," said Chelsea Welch, pro-
gramming director at the time. 
"We never got a clear answer as to 
what was aired, so we can't solve 

the problem." 
The decision to pull SRTV off-

air in May was made by Director 
of Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar, who 
has been appointed as chair of the 
new committee. 

Also serving on t11e committee 
is Warren College Resident Dean 
Claire Palmer, who shut down the 
Warren College television station 
last year after a video of American 
Nicholas Berg'S beheading was 
broadcast. Palmer stated that 
because students and the universi-
ty run the station jointly, it was 
subject to rules that warranted her 
decision to shut it down. 

Watson said he hopes the com-
mittee will be able to clear up such 
ambiguities brought up by last 
year's SRTV and WCTV black-
outs. 

"What occurred las t year 
raised a number of questions, 
which could not always be clearly

Experts critique U.S.,Islamic relations 
By ALESSANDRA RADlCATI 

Contributing Writer 
Students, experts and members 

of the community gathered Oct. 
19 at UCSD to discuss the state of 
relations between the Muslim 
world and the United States, 
including such topics as media 
biases, government policies and 
common misconceptions about 
Islam. 

"[The goal was to) build 
understanding that can both pro-
tect us and benefit the world," said 
Americans for Informed 
Democracy Executive Director 
Seth Green, whose organization 
sponsored the event. 

The meeting was part of a larg-
er ''Hope not Hate" discussion 
series, which began after the inde-
pendent commission looking into 
the Sept. II attacks called for 
greater understanding between 
the United States and Muslims. 

The meeting centered on a 
panel of experts, including UCSD 
political science professor Miles 
Kahler, San Diego State political 
science professor Dipak GuPta, 
Grossmont College sociology 
professor Bashir Idwi, and writer-
lecturer on Middle East affairs 
and former Director General of 
the Ministry of Economy of Iran's 
pre-Ayatollah government Kam 
Zarrabi. Alison St. Johns of 
National Public Radio served as 
moderator. 

After St. Johns introduced the 
panelists, they gave opening 
statements aimed at clarifying 
common misconceptions about 
Islam. 

"(We need to] emphasize the 
diversity of the Muslim world," 

Kahler said. "Too often the Muslim 
world is conflated with the Middle 
East. In filet, the Muslim world is 
vast." 

Gupta discussed the notion of 
stereotypes. 

"It is often that we hear that 
Islamic nations breed terrorists, 
but if we really look at the world 
of terrorism, we are at the fourth 
wave," Gupta said, referring to 
specific acts of terrorism resulting 
from conflicts that had nothing to 
do with Islam. 

Idwi took a more aggressive 
stance, criticizing former European 
imperial powers and comparing 
their actions to current U.S. poli-
cies. He also emphasized the impor-
tance of open forums of discussion. 

"A democracy cannot func-
tion in an atmosphere of fear," 
Idwi said. "We cannot afford to 
be silent." 

After the panelists' opening 
statements, audience members 
asked questions and heard speech-
es by two 12-year-old refugees -
an Mghani and a Kurdish Iraqi -
and a local Palestinian activist. The 
audience participation ranged from 
general comments to questions 
directed at specific panel members. 

"I thought it was very informa-
tive," John Muir College sopho-
more Reen Beilony said. "I think 
it provided an opportunity for us 
to hear opinions that usually we 
don't [hear) from the mainstream 
media." 

Idwi agreed and said that he is 
"very optimistic" about the possi-
bility of such town hall discussions 
affecting general opinion. 

Zarrabi said he was more doubt-
ful about the outcome of the event. 

"I hate to say this, but [the

Hope: Two 12-year-<>ld refugees speak 
at UCSD conference on U.S.-Islamic 
relations held on Oct. 19. 
audience] already know[s] what we 
have to say," Zarrabi said. "I'm not 
holding my breath for great 
changes because of [the meeting) ." 

Both audience members and 
panelists said that the event was 
important to maintaining an envi-
ronment of respect and under-
standing both at UCSD and in a 
broader setting. 

"[It is] so critical that we ... 
have some kind of a space for a 
conversation, for a dialogue," Idwi 
said. "[Muslims] are not really 
alien to this place. . .. They are 
your classmates, they are your 
neighbors, they are your co-work-
ers, they are your colleagues, they 
are part and parcel of this land-
scape we call the U.S."

I BRIEFLY 
Tuition hikes slowing, 
College Board finds 

While still on the rise, student fees 
increased at a slower rate in 2003-{)4 than in 
the year before, according to a series of three 
reports released by the College Board. 

In addition, student aid continues to grow 
rapidly, though loans have outpaced grant aid 
for the second year in a row, the group found. 

During the previous year, the average 
amount paid by students after aid and educa-
tion tax breaks rose to approximately $1,300 
per student The amount is less than fees 
charged a decade ago, when adjusted for infla-
tion. 

Fees at public four-year universities had the 
largest jumps, growing by 10.5 percent, com-
pared to those at private four-year institutions, 
which increased by an average of 6 percent 

Student aid rose to more than $122 billion, 
an l1-percent annual increase. However, the 
Pell Gran~ considered the "comerstone" of aid 
'for low~ncome students, has lost almost a third 
of its purchasing power over the last two 
decades, one of the studies stated. 

Another report. outlining the value of a col-
lege degree, found that higher education pro-
vides "monetary and nonmonetary benefits" 
for society. in addition to correlating to higher 
pay levels. Specifically. college graduates are 
less likely to smoke or become incarcerated 
and are more likely to be involved in their 
communities. 

UCAB to provide funding 
for annual APSA event 

Members of the University Centers Advisory 
Board voted unanimously to appropriate $500 
for an annual event to be hosted by the Asian 
and Pacific-Islander Student Alliance. 

Designed to provide free college counsel-
ing to high school students. the event is esti-
mated to cost more than $8,000. In the pas~ 
its costs have been covered by money from 
the university'S student-initiated outreach 
funding. but state cuts to UC outreach have 
forced the organization to seek outside 
sources of funding. 

Though APSA had originally requested that 
UCAB cover the estimated $504 in costs for 
audio and visual equipment and technicians, 
board b0aws limit funding to $500. 

Report credits city council 
for water votes 

A joint report from the student-run 
Strategic Community Consulting firm and San 
Diego Baykeeper environmental group have 

awarded the city a ' B" grade based on votes 
made by the city. council to protect water 
quality. SCC is operated by UCSD's Graduate 
School of International Relations and Pacific 
Studies. 

The third-annual report card showed a 
"marked improvement" over the previous year. 
First initiated in 2002, the report is based on 
numerical points awarded to individual coun-
cilmembers for votes on environmental issues 
that impact water. 

Council members Jim Madaffer and Brian 
Maienschein eamed the lowest scores, each 
receiving a "C -." 

The groups awarded Council member Toni 
Atkins the highest grade. Atkins joins two 
other lawmakers who have received "A+" 
grades. 

While the report showed an increase in "B" 
and "C grades over the previous year, the 
report card stated there was a "positive trend" 
in lawmaker votes. 

Study: Students ad 
responsibly with credit 

College students deserve high ma rks for 
handling issues of personal credit, a forthcom-
ing study from the Georgetown University . 
Credit Research Center has found. 

Adult coll~e attendees who qualify for a 
credit card maintain smaller account balances 
and lower credit limits and use their cards less 
frequently than others in the same age group. 
the study stated. 

Almost 90 percent of college students keep 
their accounts current, at approximately the 
same level as older adults. the center found. 

Based on actual account activity, the study, 
due out in November, also calculated an aver-
age balance of $552 for college students' 
accounts. or nearly one-third less than the aver-
age balance for nonstudent young adults and 
one-fourth of an average older adult's account 
balance. 

Researchers discover gene 
for brain disorder .-

Researchers at UCSD School of Medicine· 
have found a gene for Joubert Syndrome, a 
condition that affects control of balance and 
coordination by the brain. 

The disease affects approximately one out 
of every 10,000 people and manifests itself as 
excessive folds in the brain and the absence of 
part of the cerebellum. After five years of 
research, UCSD scientists made the discovery-
at the same time as a research team at Harvard 
University. Reports from both groups will 
appear in the November issue of the American 
Journal of Human Genetics.

will be accepted until all the positions have 
been filled. 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed' upcoming legis-

lation that would convert the A.S. commis-
sioners from elected positions to appoint-
ed ones. The legislation. which was with-

drawn from the agenda for the meeting on 
Oct. 20, met opposition in tHe caucus.

THUISDo\Y. OCTOIB 21, 2004 THE UCSD GUAP.DIAN NEWS } 

Flu: Administrators cite national shortage 
continI4td from pace J 

according to Petruc:ce1li. 
This yar\ flu vaccine demand 

also increased due to widespread 
media coverage. 

"It's in the national and local 
news," Buchman said. "Any time 
we had the word 'shortage: so 
many more people felt like they 
needed the vaccine than in a regu-
lar year." 

Nationally, some flu vaccine 
distributors are offering to sell 
doses at 10 times the normal price 
to hospitals, according to media 
reports. 

Student Health Services is 
offering the vaccine to those in the 
high-risk group at SIS per dose, 
and Mission Valley Medical Clinic 
prancies flu shOll for S20, both 
unc:hanrs:! from previous yean. 

"If Student Health Services] 
doesn't give [the flu vaccine] to me 
for some reason. then I'll SO to my 
health care provider." said Mary 
Palomino. a first-year student at 
UCSD School of Medicine. 

She may qualify for the shot 
' because of her frequent contact 
with patients as a volunteer at the 
UCSD Free Clinic, Palomino said, 

predicting that her private provider 
would be less saict than Student 
Health Services to enforce CDC 
guidelines. 

Students who cannot receive the 
flu vaccine should wash their hands 
regularly, get lOll of rest and take 
precautions around those who are 
siCk, according to Buchman. 

"The healthy young adult popu-
lation should realize the chance of 
getting complications from 
ihfluenza is low," Buchman said.

answered," he said. "This is an 
effort to get the answers before 
other issues come up." 

The committee consists of five 
UCSD administrators from vari-
ous campuses and one A.S. repre-
sentative, raising concerns among 
some student leaders that students 
will be underrepresented. 

"Each campus media [oudet] is 
run very differently," A.S. 
President Jenn Pae said. "I would 
hope that there would be more stu-
dent representation on the com-
mittee so that there is a better 
understanding of how student-run· 
media works on campus. I don't 
thinlc that is an accurate represen-
tation at all." 

According to A.S. Vice 
President Internal Cat Yapyuco, 
she received several applications 
for the single student representa~ 
tive position. 

MRelative to other committees, 
this one is definitely a high-inter-
est committee," she said. 

Out of the applicants, Welch 
was appointed as the A.S. represen-

tative to the committee on Oct. 19. 
Pae plans to asle Watson to include 
additional students on the commit-
tee in order tu better represent the 
campus television stations. 

"This one student is not only 
supposed to represent the A.S. stu-
dent-run television station but all 
of the colleges, which malees it 
extremely difficult," Pae said. 

Watson said he would entertain 
requests for more representation 
on the committee. 

"If the A.S. wants to have more 
representation, I would welcome 
it," WatsOn said. "I have absolutely 
no problem with more representa-
tives. " 

However, WatsOn said the com-
mittees task does not seem to 
require multiple student represen-
tatives, as it is charged to review 
the clarity of campus television sta-
tions' guidelines and determine 
who is to be held responsible for 
content. 
. "When you say you want lots of 

representation, you're implying 
that there's going to be delibera-
tion and some type of policy deci-

sion," Watson said. "The only 
thing that is going to be voted on 
here is 'Do you believe this is 
c1e.ar?' and 'Do you understand 
what this means?'" 

Student leaders have also 
expressed concern that the com-
mittee may be used to limit free 
speech rights. 

"I would hope that this commit-
tee expedites or makes the process 
clear, rather than inhibits our free 
speech rights on campus in the 
media," Pae said. 

In response to the concerns, 
Watson said the committee will in 
no way modify television station 
policies, but will merely review 
them to evaluate clarity. 

"The one issue that I felt was 
important is there not be any sort 
of interpretation of things by the 
members of · this committee," 
Watson said. 

Watson also said he hopes the 
committee will submit a report of 
its findings by Nov. 10.

Lawmakers must hold , 
aid office accountable 

I t is far past due for Congress to address the 
serious problems plagu-

ing the Department of 
Education's Office of Federal 
Student Aid, In its mandate 
to allow low-income stu-
dents to attend college, the 
office is clearly failing, as a 
new report by the American 
CouncIl on Education shows 
that only half of all likely eli-
gible underg:aduates apply 
for federal ald at all. 

The organization is 
responsible for serving as a 
central clearinghouse that 
coordinates deadlines and 
streamlines the aid applica-
tion process; that more 
than half of all applicants 
complete their applications 
after the deadline to receive 
the full amount of aid to 
which they are entitled is 
overwhelming evidence of 
the agency's colossal orga-
nizational breakdown. 

Additionally, 'the agency's 
budget requests in past years 

have underestimated the 
support necessary for the 
PeU Grant program by bil-
lions of dollars, resuJting in 
the agency borrowing from 
future years' budgets and 
threatening the program's 
ability to fulfill its mandate 
in the coming years. 

In 1998, Congress 
designed the Office of 
Federal Student Aid as a 
"performance-based organi-
zation," a title that provides 
flexibility for the agency but 
demands accountability of 
its officials. Despite the 
mandate, a new report from 
the Governmen t 
Accountability Office shows, 
the agency has left student 
aid programs vulnerable to 
"fraud, waste and abuse." 

It's time for lawmakers 
to hold the agency account-
able. Like any or~anization 
facing an institutlonal fail-
ure, the leadership of the 
student aid office must be 
overhauled. 

Registration fee members 
should take pay cuts 

M embers of the Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee, which advises 
Student Affairs on how stu-
dents' registration fees are 
allocated, must take imme-
diate steps to reduce their 
exorbitant pay. \Vith fees 
rising, students can ill 
afford to see so much 
money - at least $1,600 
for each regular member 
and far more for committee 
leadership - diverted from 
key programs. 

Just two years ago, stu-
dent representatives on the 
committee received no 
compensation, and today 
faculty members on the 
committee continue to per-
form their duties in advising 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W Watson 
without any additional 
wages. 

Like student representa-
tives on other equally 
important campuswide 
boards, including the 
Student Regulations 
Revision Committee and 
the Security Advisory 

Committee, members of 
RFAC must be willing to 
perfonn their J'obs for the 
satisfaction an experience 
they receive by serving stu-
dents, not for the paycheck. 

At the very least, they 
must take a pay cut reflec-
tive of budget reductions in 
every other unit of 
Watson's department, as 
some committee members 
have proposed. 

Last year, the committee 
showed its irrelevance in 
the appropriation process of 
registration fee funds. 
Despite a strong committee 
recommendation not to do 
so, Watson provided fund-
ing for the Express to 
Success program, with a 
student-fee price tag of 
more than $40,000 per year. 

At the very least, if 
Watson continues to pay 
members of RFAC - like 
everything else, the pay is 
at his dIscretion - he 
should allow them to start 
earning the money by 
actually giving them some 
degree of authority and 
responsibility,

Aftertaste 

I went to Mud Run at Camp Pendleton this weekend. I went to cheer on my friends, 
who, along with hundreds of 
other hardy runners, dashed and 
crawled through 6.2 miles of dirt 
and mud. The event was manned 
by Marines, who all wore fatigue 
pants and promotional T-shirts, 
their chisled torsos marking the 
cut-off between their separate 
lives . As we drove along the 
road , my friends and I saw row 
after row of Army helicopters 
and vehicles. Homemade 
"Welcome Back Dad !" posters 
dotted the fences . I remembered 
that Camp Pendleton is nOt just 
a race site some thirty minutes 
away. It is a military base, and it 
trains soldiers for war. 

Many of those who live and 
train there are college-aged. 
They train for the ground war in 
Iraq, while we are amidst the 
ground war for votes. It's not the 
same, as we are assaulted with 
fliers and registration forms, 
stickers and buttons, pleas and 
entreaties. No bullets, although 
there are verbal darts. No body 
armor, just steely determination. 

You've heard it all before. The 
elderly vote in droves, the young 
vote in drips. It may not be "vote 
or die," but it does seem that 
way sometimes. UCSD, and 
especially Associated Students, 
has been commendably aggres-
sive in getting the vote out on 
campus. Just look at the creepy 
patriotic mannequin in the cor-

" ... one reason far

ner of Geisel Library or any 
school computer desktop adver-
tising "Rock the Vote!" for that 
matter. 

Beyond the classroom banter 
about the presidential debates 
and the obvious leftist leanings of 
most of the faculty, a question 

that comes to mind is: What 
matters to us? Vv'hat matters to 
this generation, the generation 
that is going to inherit the reper-
cussions of today's policies? 
Affording higher education mat-
ters. So do hot-button social 
issues, such as gay rights and 
abortion rights. Also important 
are the endeavors of those from 
Camp Pendleton in Afghanistan 
or Iraq. 

There is no Viemam-esque 
atmosphere. Many are vocal, but 
hardly en masse. The campus is 
slightly cold, sleepy even, in 
comparison to the passion of 
yesteryear. It's not a bad thing 
per se - indeed, disaster pre-
cedes olltrage. However, one 
reason for the sense of compla-
cency, I'd say, is because Iraq' IS 
fought by a volunteer army. Say 
the word "draft," however, and I 
will show you fire from ice. 
Students will be instantly mobi-
lized. They'll start paying close 
attention to issues, which sud-
denly concern them in a tangible 
way. 

Many students are politically 
and civically engaged, and even 
more so right now. Yet, by and 
large, our age group remains a 
puzzle, if not a disappointment, 
at least according to the' media 
and voting statistics. 
Optimistically speaking, stu-
dents care in a very understated 

Stj! COWMN, Page s

Students' 

draft fears are 
overblown 

continued from page 4 
way. 

Thus, I scowled when I heard 
the draft rumor. Don't tell me that 
suddenly every collegian cares 
about politics just because they do 
not want to be drafted. And people 
would blindly believe this stuff? I 
overreacted, but the scary draft bill 
that was going to enslave us all to 
military service was, in fact, a bill 
written by a Democrat to illumi-
nate the discrepancies of minority 
enlistees. It was defeated 402-2. 
Kerry and Bush, in a rare display of 
consensus, have declared that nei-
ther one of them will institute a 
draft. 

Despite the exploitation of the 
issue by mass e-mails and obnox-
ious Web sites, a draft is clearly 
out of the question. Even so, it 
should be noted that the army 
isn't a cornucopia of the willing 
and able either. In fact, as a Time 
article reported last week, 13 7,000 
American soldiers are currently in 
Iraq, a 15,000 increase from the 
beginning of the year. Forty-three 
percent deployed are from the 
National Guard and reserves. The 
numbers get bleaker: Guard 
recruitment is down 12 percent, 
according to Newsweek, and the 
Army has only 18 percent of the 
required commitments to serve 
next year. As even the least-
informed college sfudent can see, 
the situation in Iraq is not getting 
any better. 

Though there is no draft in 
sight, it is not an impossibility. No 
matter which side of the fence you 
lean on, our self-interest, our 
country and our mortality bond us 
aU. The draft is such a touchy issue 
because it raises the idea of sacri-
fice - involuntary sacrifice. God 
forbid, we might give ourselves to 
the public good. We haven't done 
anything to earn the right to vote, 
criticize our leaders or ignore 
everything. Yet we are free to do it 
all. We haven't been asked to do 
much of anything, other than to 
cast a ballot. Will it take a draft to 
mobilize us? If you hide under the 
cover of ignorance, checlc out 
http:lhvW7JJ.presidtntmatcb.com or 
http:lhJJW7JJ.cnn.clmI as a starting 
point to getting informed. 

The question of sacrifice is not 
if, but when and what. Sacrificing 
time to care now can prevent hav-
ing to pay the ultimate sacrifice 
later - by our Camp Pendleton 
peers, or yes, even us.

The San Diego Asian Film Festival celebrates its fim I year of 
innovative works from all over Asia. By Thomas Kim, Contributing Writer 

film festival is not just a collectiQrl of screen-
ings, as this year 's annual San Diego Asian 
Film Festival will attest. The festival, which 
runs from Oct. 21 to Oct. 24, will feature 
over I 50 films from 12 countries and 
hopes to bring together actors, filmmakers 
and viewers alike to interact through work-
shops, panels and receptions. 

Muay-Thai -style kickboxing. "Josee, the Tiger and the Fish,',' is -a Japanese 
movie about a romance between a college student and a disabled woman. 
"When 705 Attacks," made by "three Tustin chumps," offers a whimsical set 
of ridiculously funny short films. Anime fans will be able to watch 
"Steamboy," the most expensive anime film ever made. Films at the festi-
val are not limited to those from East and South Asia; "Silence of the Sea." 
a documentary feature about an Iranian man's fight to retum home, will 
also be shown. "The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam," a documentary by 
Ann Marie Fleming about her vaudevillian great-grandfather, closes the fes-
tival on Oct. 24. The festival was conceived by organizer 

Lee Ann Kim while she was "lying in bed in 
1999." The first San Diego Asian Film 
Festival was organized by the Asian 

American Journalists Association of San Diego and held at the University of 

Several prominent members of the Asian-American film community will 
attend the festival. In addition to Kelly Hu ("X2") and Sung Kang ("Better 
Luck Tomorrow," "Pearl Harbor"), John Cho and Kal Penn of this summer's 

San Diego in 2000. Since then, the festival has given 
birth to the San Diego Asian Film Foundation, a non-
profit organization for which Kim serves as executive 
director. In its mission statement, the SDAFF states that 
it is "dedicated to educating the community about the 
rich diversity of the Asian Pacific Islander culture through 
films and videos." Although the primary event of the 
SDAFF is the annual festival, the foundation also pro-
motes cultural awareness in local high schools and col-
leges by offering internships and cultural literacy pro-
grams. 

The festival kicks off w ith "The Ride," a film by UCSD 
graduate Nathan Kurosawa. on Oct. 21. The piece fol-
lows a cocky surfer who travels through time to Waikiki, 
Hawaii in 191 I to meet Duke Kahanamoku , the leg-
endary father of modern surfing. The film was made in 
17 days with a budget of around $1 million and won 
two awards at the Hawaii International Film Festival. 
Kurosawa's short II Kadomatsu" won the Audience 
Award for Best Short Subject at the same festival in 
1996.

"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" will also make 
an appearance. Cho and Penn will participate in a panel, 
"Harold and Kumar Go to San Diego," that will reveal an 
honest look at the pros and cons of working in 
Hollywood and feature the real Harold Lee, on whom 
the character in the movie was based. 

A reality television/documentary film panel called 
"Getting Real with Reality" will include comedian Oat 
Phan. the winner of NBC's "Last Comic Standing," in 
addition to Harlemm Lee. the winner of NBC's "Fame." 
Lisa Ling ("The View") will also attend to present two 
pieces of her work with National Geographic: 
"Basketball Diplomacy: From Mao to Yao." and "China's 
Lost Girls.· The former deals with Houston Rocket's 
center Yao Ming's rise to fame in the United States, and 
the latter focuses on baby girls orphaned in China due to 
the country's one-child policy. 

Kim encourages both Asians and non-Asians to attend 
the festival, saying, MFilm transcends cultural and eco-
nomic barriers, and the San Diego Asian Film Festival is 
the only place where you can journey through Asian 
America through provocative, entertaining and enlight-
ening films that you won't see anywhere else."

album reviews 

Let's imagine: no ner-vous breakdown, no 1970s spent in a bed, no 
refusal to return to an aban-
doned masterpiece. 

Had Brian Wilson 
recorded and released Smile 
in 1967 at age 25 , the Beach 

Boys would have shared 
best-album-ever honors 
with the Beatles. In this 
alternate reality, Sgt. 
Pepper's Lontl] Htllrts Club 
Btmd would represent the 
apex of British rock 'n' roll, 
and Smile would be the apex 
of American (more specifi-
cally, Californian) psyche-
delia. 

However, this is 2004, 
and 37 years have .passed 
since Wilson walked away 
from Smile. His voice has 
aged over those 37 years, 
and these innocent songs 
carry differently when sung 
by an old man. 
Nonetheless, this album is 
musically perfect. Wilson's 
songwriting and producing 
slcills are genius. Lush 
vocals and fine-tuned 

up with bands or MCs in 
order to release full-length 
works of music. Aphex Twin, 
DJ Shadow and even Moby 
have begun to push the 
envelope by composing 
records almost entirely 
alone. 
. Enter British electronic 

virtuoso RJD 2. After releas-
ing his first solo project, 
Deadringrr, in 2002, RJD2 
was quick to · return with 
Sinct We Last Spoke, one of 
the year's most exhilarating 
e.lectronic albums. Eclectic A growing line of produc~ in a way only digital music ers and DJs have begun can be, RJD2 takes us on a to turn their creative fast-paced journey through

instrumentation weave 
together youthful , tragical-
ly comedic songs about life, 
love and America. The 
album is musically rooted in 
old-time American tradi-
tions: folk, jazz, ad jingles, 
Aaron Copeland, barber-
shop quartets, banjoes, car-
toons, cannabis, saloon 
pianos and, of course, surf 
guitar. 

Wilson can sleep easy, 
for he has finally formulat-

tracks with such melan-
cholic ones that Si"ce We 
lAst Spoke seems to encom-
pass the entire human con-
dition. "Iced Lighting" 
strikes with such haunting 
drum-and-bass beats that 
the track numbs the listener 
into a trance and leaves 
them waiting for that last 
climactic hit to drop. 

The ultimate goal of 
good music is to move the 
crowd - not just to dance , 
but sometimes to think and 
feel also. With Since We Last

a single man can do exactly 
that.

-A decorous alternat ive to 
-typical California sloppiness 
cupcakes 
and galas 

Neha Singh 

Since when did we replace the night of formal dinner and dancing with a sojourn to fast 
food places followed by dry hump-
ing at clubs? I can never quite for-
get how incredibly casual 
California culture is after deciding 
to kiss a gorgeous Bay area summer 
goodbye in favor of volunteering at 
a hospital in India. 

Don't tell me you:ve never 
rolled out of bed and gone to class 
in your pajamas, or that you usual-
ly prefer sit-down meals to faster 
service. I'm guilty of this syndrome 
myself: I wi ll always remember the 
ti me a friend came to pick me up 
for lunch in [ndia while I was in a 
faded pair of jeans and a T-shirt, 
and asked pointedly how long it 
would take me to get ready. 
Initially I thought that these peo-
ple simply did not know how to 
relax, but after having lived there 
for a few weeks, I started to see the 
perks of dressing decently and hav-
ing impeccable table manners. 

back in that quintessential 
California way and being inappro-
priare. 

My stay at International House 
on campus this year might further 
perpetuate my new frustration with 
this aspect of California culture. 
Hanging out with international stu-
dents every day, it is almost impossi-
ble not to notice the differences 
between us, despite the numerous 
similarities we share. Pizza is gener-
ally eaten with a knife and fork, and 
many enjoy getting dressed up and 
going to events. with regularity and 
great politeness. 

In contrast, California natives 
generally call everyone by their first 
names and get offended when some-
one calls them "sir" or "ma'am" 
since they think the title challenges 
their youthful appearance. There 
are also times we do not know when 
to keep our mouths shut. T he other 
day, my apartment-mate was having 
lunch at Plaza Cafe, only to hear two 
girls sitting next to her discussing 
their (extended) experiences in giv-
ing blowjobs and whether or nor 
spitting diminishes the romantic 
aspect of oral sex. Did I mention 
they were in their pajamas as well ? 
In our culture of "anything goes," 
how far will we really let ourselves 
slide before we start to look truly 
ridiculous' 

READ UCSD, Mondays & Thursdays in the Guardian 

Don't get me wrong - I am a 
fan of grabbing a quick, hassle-free 
bite to eat and of being able to walle 
around in pretty much anything 
without getting weird glances from 
people. However, I cannot help but 
wonder if we are missing that cer-
tain "je ne sais quoi" when it comes 
to conducting ourselves. Call me 
old-fashioned, but what happened 
to going out in something other 
than sneakers and flip-flops? There 
is a fine line between being laid 

J am definitely not advocating a 
return to the Victorian era, or saying 
that it is inappropriate to walle 
around in a sweatshirt and flip-flops. 
However, it might be nice to watch 
what we talk about so freely in pub-
lic or to forgo those regular trips to 
In-N-Out with friends for a more 
planned and slow-paced meal. 
Loolcing nice and eating with actual 
silverware (gasp!) with a napkin in 
your lap couldn't be that awful, 
right?

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Tritons: Caitlin Ryan scores game .. winner 
continued. from page 12 

and centered a pass to an onrushing 
freshman mid fielder Ali Lai. Lai, 
who was hounded by a Warrior, 
overran the ball a bit but was able 
to deflect it behind her to Ryan, 
who then flicked the ball past 
Vaughans right side from eight 
yards out. 

The game-winning goal was 
Ryan's third goal of the season, 
with Cochran and Lai each picking 
up an assist on the play. 

UCSD did not let up offen-
sively and forced Vaughan to 
make three more saves in the sec-
ond half. The Tritons outshot the 
Warriors, 8-2, in the half and 
frustrated their defense. In the 
78th minute, Cal State Stanislaus 
senior defender Grace Cochrun 
was penalized with a red card for 
forcibly knocking down sopho-
more midfielder Megan Dickey. 

The Tritons took advantage of 
the short-handed Warriors by cre-
ating a couple more scoring 
chances in the closing minutes. 
Senior midfielder J adyn Shaffer 
sent in a corner kick that sopho-
more midfielder Heather Sugg 
headed toward the net, but 
Vaughan jumped to tip the ball 
over the crossbar. Vaughan record-

teams in the upcoming weeks; 
however, they must travel to 
Carson, Calif., to play the Toros on 
the road on Oct. 23 . Although the 
Taros are undefeated, the Tritons 
held them to a scoreless tie in a 
Sept. 22 contest. 

As for the Roadrunners, UCSD 
must hope for the same outcome as 
the last time they played in 
Bakersfield, Calif., on Sept. 19. 
The Tritons managed a 1-0 win 
against Cal State Bakersfield, but 
the team has improved steadily ' 
since then, and the upcoming Oct. 
30 match at RlMAC Field will be 
crucial for the Tritons. 

"The wins weren't pretty, but a 
win's a win," Marquand said. 

No matter how they do it, the 
Tritons need to win their next four 
games, the first of which was 
scheduled for Oct. 20, but was 
del~yed on account of rain.

Lautenschleger had one save in her 
eighth shutout of the season.

these teams."

fielder Alise Malley and Szafraniec 
in time for the upcoming matches. 

"Hopefully they'll both be right 
for [the next game], because obvi-
ously we've got two massive games 
coming up," McManus said. "We 
need at least a win or tie in those 
two games. Dominguez is going to 
be a tough game up there [on their 

home field] ." 
UCSD has three games left in 

the season, all of which will be crit-
ical for the postseason. UCSD was 
scheduled to host Cal Poly 
Pomona at home on Oct. 20, but 
the match was postponed due to 
rain . The date and time of the 
postponed match was not deter-
mined at press time. ' 

On Oct. 23, the Tritons will 
take the field in a pivotal South 
Division match against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills (11-4-1), which 
trails UCSD in the CCAA stand-
ings by three points. The match 
against the Toros will begin at 4 :30 
p.m. in Carson, Calif. The Tritons' 
next home match is on Oct. 27 
against Cal State San Bernardino. 

Although the Trimns are a 
young team, they have stepped up 
to the challenge and hold first place 
overall in their conference. They 
expect to finish strong and said 
they know the upcoming games are 
crucial. 

"We've got four big games 
coming up, and they're [against] 
really hard tealUs like San 
Bernardino and Dominguez Hills, 
so we can't overlook any of these 
teams," Lai said. "We have to 
really take it one at a time."

Men's socce'r wins double-overtime thriller 
Triton forward Jon Krupansky scores game-winner against Cal State Stanislaus 

Andrew Mo/Cuotdion 
Must-win: Junior midfielder Grant Nishio (middle) and the Tritons need to win their remaining four games to secure a spot 
in the upcoming California Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs. 

By RAIL ENTEEN 
Contributing Writer 

After winning his 300th career 
game Oct. 15, men's soccer head 
coach Derek Armstrong was opti-
mistic about the remainder of the 
season. 

"We will win a few more," 
Armstrong said. 

That is exacdy what the Tritons 
did on Oct. 17 in a 1-0 double-
overtime win against Cal State 
Stanislaus at RIMAC Field, and it 
is what they plan to do for the next 
four games before the California 
Collegiate Athletics Association 
playoffs begin. 

Armstrong's inspirational words 
seem to have struck a chord with 
the Tritons, who bounced back 
from a two-game losing streak with 
back-to-back wins to spark a fire 
under the squad as playoffs 
approach. 

One of the team's losses was to 
Cal State San Bernardino in a 
crushing 2-1 double-overtime 
defeat that destroyed Triton 
morale. 

This week, however, UCSD was 
on the other end of the stick, hand-
mg the Warriors an overtime loss 
in the I03rd minute, when junior 
forward Jon Krupansky headed a 
pass from junior mid fielder Matt 
Davey through the posts and past 
Warrior goalkeeper Jose Mando 
Herrera. 

Herrera played remarkably well, 
considering that the Tritons out-
shot the Warriors, 15-4. 

UCSD senior goalkeepers 
Edward Ruhland and Scott 
Mazurier combined for a shutout 
win. The Tritons have not allowed 
a goal :n two games thanks to a 

combination of steadfast goal keep-
ing, clever defense and an aggres-
sive offense that has kept oppo-
nents on their heels. 

UCSD needs to maintain this 
level of play if it plans on making 
the CCAA Championship. 

"It's win or go home," senior 
defensemanlmidfielder Nick 
Marquand said. "If we lose a game 
right now, we can pretty much 
write off the playoffs. It's kind of 
like a single-game elimination 
tournament. " 

Although the Tritons face tough 
competition in the next four games, 
if they can keep shutting out oppo-
nents and coming up with clutch 
goals, they have a chance to roll 
right into the CCAA Finals. 

The matchup against the 
Warriors was a physical game. 
UCSD committed 14 fouls to the 
Warriors' 16, which included one 
in the second overtime that led to 
the winning goal. The Tritons also 
played an aggressive offense, out-
shooting the Warriors and beating 
them in corner kicles, 10-2. 

This type of dominating play 
has emerged during the Tritons' 
last two games, against the 
Warriors and Chico State. 

"This weekend against Chico 
and Stanislaus, with the two 
shutouts, just proves how solid our 
defense is," Marquand said. 

With the win, UCSD ups its 
record to 7-2-3 overall and 6-2-2 in 
league play. Its CCAA record is 
good enough for a No.3 ranking in 
the South Division, behind Cal 
State Bakersfield and the undefeat-
ed Toros of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. The Tritons will face both

An equestrian, according to 
"Webster's Dictionary," is defined 
as "one who rides on horseback; a 
horseman; a rider." Although it 
may not be widely known, equestri-
an is a growing club sport at 
UCSD. 

"I was told that we didn't have 
an equestrian team when I first got 
here ," senior co-captain Kate 
McComas said. "Now we try to get 
the word out to everyone, and not 
everyone knows that it takes a lot of 
training and dedication." 

Expanding since 1993, the 
equestrian team now has more than 
30 members, 28 of whom compete. 

Riders participate in shows in 
both the Western and English 
styles of riding. Members compete 
in different classes, ranging from 
the walk trotlbasic horsemanship 
level to the open classes for the 
most advanced riders. 

Last year, the equestrian team 
sent three riders, graduate Linda 
Torres, senior Shannon Ward and 
senior Marce Evans to the 
Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association 2004 National Horse 
Show in Murfeesborough, Tenn. 
Torres took third place and Ward 

placed ninth in their respective 
divisions. 

This year the team includes five 
members who have never been on a 
horse before. 

"We are very accommodating 
to people who have never ridden 
before," McComas said. 

Riders are not required to own 
their own horses; in fact, riders at 
IHSA shows draw lots for which 
horse they will compete on out of 
aU of the horses brought by com-
peting schools. This makes the 
competition more fair and provides 
an inexpensive way for college stu-
dents to ride and show. 

"It is a challenge to get on anoth-
er person's horse that I have never 
been on before," said sophomore 
Kalle Larson, a new team member. 
"It really shows how good of a rider 
you are." 

The UCSD team practices on 
horses that the trainers or coaches 
own. 

"It is in your favor to know all 
the UCSD horses because you 
aren't allowed to warm up with the 
horse - you get on and are imme-
diately judged," McComas said. 

For this and other reasons, 
McComas classifies equestrian

After last week's 1-1 tie against 
Chico State, the No. 16 UCSD 
women's soccer team edged Cal 
State Stanislaus, 1-0, on a goal by 
freshman midfielder Caidin Ryan. 
The Oct. 17 win at RlMAC Field 
kept the Tritons at the top of the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rankings. 

The team is in the final stretch 
of its regular season, and with sec-
ond-place Cal State Dominguez 
Hills keeping it close, UCSD's 
win kept it in first place in the 
South division. The win improves 
the Tri tons' record to 12 -1-1 
while dropping the Warriors to 8-
5-3. 

"That was a big win; you only 
play [Chico State and Cal State 
Stanislaus] once," UCSD head 
coach Brian McManus said. "We 
dropped two points [in tying 
Chico State] and took three points 
[in the win]. In the end, the result 
was right. The biggest disappoint-
ment is losing the two points [in 
the tie]. That could cost us in the 
long run. [But] it was a great 
weekend, and the kids had good 
attitudes." . 

Although the Tritons scored 
only once, they dominated the 
Warriors for most of the game, 
producing several scoring oppor-
tunities. And despite missing 
injured junior defender Heather 
Szafraniec in the starting lineup, 
UCSD played smart defensively,

preventing Cal State Stanislaus 
from creating any solid scoring 
chances. 

The Tritons came out aggres-
sive in the first half, spending 
much of their time in the 
Warriors' defensive zone. Their 
first scoring chance came when 
freshman forward Rachel 
Lindenfeld won a corner battle 
to cut in toward the net, enabling 
her to center a pass to freshman 
mid fielder Chelsey Campbell. 
Campbell took a shot that was 
blocked by Warrior junior goalie 
Breanna Vaughan, who ended up 
bailing out her teammates with 
key saves to keep .the match 
dose. 

The Tritons had seven corner 

Icicles in the first half, compared to 
only one for the Warriors. Senior 
goalie Jamie Lautenschleger shut 
down any chance for a Warrior 
goal when she came out and 
caught the comer kick with less 
than six minutes remaining. 

UCSD's aggressive play finally 
paid off in the second half when 
the Tritons pulled ahead in the 
53rd minute. It started out with a 
key defensive play by freshman 
Nicole Pepper, who stole the ball 
at about midfield and pushed it 
ahead to sophomore forward 
Kelly Cochran. Cochran dribbled 
the ball down the line, faking out 
her opponent, cut into the box
