Since you asked 
the budget facts 

The 1983-84 Governor's 
Budget for the University of 
California provides $1.185 
bi \I ion from all sta te sou rces 
for University operations, 
which is a net increase of $18 
million or 1.5 percent, 
exclusive of salary range 
adjustments, 

Additionally, the Governor's 
Budget prolX)SeS an increase in 
the UC Educational Fee of 
$150 per year to finance 
specified student service 
programs and to increase the 
funds available for financial 
aid necessitated by the fee 
increase. The fee increase will 
replace $1-+,6 million of , tate 
funds which currently support 
these activit ies. If approved, 
the increase would bring 
average UC fees 10 $1,350 per 
year per swdent. 

"Given the , tate''i severe 
financial problems and the 
threat of sub<,lanlial 
reductions to t he University's 
budget." said LTC Pre"idenl 
David S, Saxon, "I inlerprel 
t hE' proposed budget as 

indicating the high priority 
Governor George Deukmejian 
give ' to the Ul11verslty of 
Cali fornia and to education 
generally." Saxon character-
ized the budgel as "fair, 
although it leaves important 
needs unmer." 

The Governor's budget 
provides $49 million for 
increases in so-called "fixed 
costs and workload," Fixed 
costs include inflation-related 
price increases for items 
ranging from utilities to 
library materials, The 
workload funds will support 
new faculty, staff and other 
increased costs assOCiated 
with about 1,600 addilional 
students expected at the 
Uni\'ersity, The 1983-84-
budget al..,o proposes an 
addilional $2 million 
augmentation deSignated for 
instructional equipment 
replacement. [ncluded in the

I t was a very bad 
story ... 1 guess 
Editor: 

I must express my re\'ulsion 
for the story "[1 Was a Very 
Bad Year . , ,r Guess," bv Scott 
Young in the January 20 issue 
of The L-CSD Cuardian, His 
mockery of the suicides of 
three UCSD students in 1979 
en ed no purpose, in my eyes, 

and was only terri bly 
offensive. 

Mr, Young's analogy of the 
] lth floor patio of Tioga Hall 
as a nice place to tan and to 
commit SUicide was purely 
morbid, The senseless details 
of Amy's body hitting the 
racks and the bent, bloody 
bikes only disgusted me, Other 
pointless comments such as 
the grad -;tudent found dead on 
the playing field as a delay to 
the lawn mower man or as 
be1l1g a feast for Ihe ants were 

completel) ludicrous and 
again, \er} offensl\e, 

Whal was the purpo"e of 
this story? It certainly was not 
10 enLerlain or to inform, 
Would the author have given 
more respect to the memones 
of Ihese students had they not 
taken their own lives? How 
would the parents of these 
students felt had they read 
this? 

[ am shocked that our 
Guardian would print such a 
farce , Since The Gual'diall is a 
student-run paper, it is 
therefore a reflect ion of all the 
sludents here al UCSD, r am 
embarrassed to be a part of the 
insl itution that reflects tim 
kind of Iiteralure. 1t was a \'ery 
bad story, , , I guess,

Letters to the Editor 

Pumpkin drop not linked to suicide 
Ed itor: 

I am writing this in 
reference to the article, "It 
Was a Very Bad Year ... 1 
Guess," written by our most 
exorbitanl editor Thursday, 
Jan, 20, as 1 am livid with a 
reference made between the 
Muir Collge Halloween 
Pumpkin Drop and the 
unfortunate suicide that 
occurred in 1979. I cannol 
believe that the connection of 
our holiday act ivity and "a 
bizarre ritual in honor of Ihis 

suicide" was inferr'd, and 
seriously question the 
mentality of the person 
making this inference, 

First of all, I he annual 
Pumpkin Drop began in 1976 
to celebrale lIalioween with 
ani) the fun of a candy-filled 
orb dropped from Tioga Hall to 
spew its contents to the 
spectators \\'aiting below, 
Secondly, being involved in the 
Muir Res. Hall Council. I have 
organized this event in 1980 
and 1981 and at no time was 

the associalion made between 
our acti\'ily and the suicide-
not even in jest! And last of all. 
as an annual activity, \ve al 
Muir College are deeply 
insu Ited to see t his connect ion 
sugges l ed campus-wide 
through The Cuardian and 
prefer that the demented 
writing of our editor be kept in 
Lit. 121.

Muir College Council is legitimate 
Editor: 

As a mem ber of l\.luir College 
Council, [was offended by the 
remarks made by ;\1uir College 
Rep, Stephen Haskins in The 
Guardiall on Jan, 17, 1983, Mr. 
Ha"k1l1s complains that the 
;'\.tUlr College Councd is a farce 
and that the structure of the 
COli ncil is resistant to change 
because "It's there before you" 
and I hus "it must be better 
and greater t han you are," 

I would like to point (lut that 
Representatl\'e Haskins has 
attended only five out of 
seventeen meetings of M,C.C, 
The Muir College Council i" 
not a tyrannical body, 

J~epresentative Haskins is 
ent illed to a vote just as the 
other two representat ives and 
commissioners, [f Rep , 
I [aski ns believes a change in 
I he structure of the Council is 
necessary to meet the needs of 
the student s, it is his duty as 
an elected Muir official to seek 
OUI thesechanges, "('0 shu n the 
whole democralic process, by 
not attending meet ings, and to 
Crtt leize t he Council as a stat i( 

inslitution seems to me to be a 
ch Icken, hearted sci f. f ulfi II ing 
prophecy, 

I encourage Rep, Haskins to 
attend to the responsiblitie" of 
which he was elect ed and to 
fight for what he belie\ es 

through t he open democrat ic 
chan neb instead of merelv 
criticizing from afar. -

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Siall Writer!. 
WHAT' GOING ON HERE DEPT. Were we e\er bored 
Friday night. We arrived early at Triton Pa\'illion to get good 
seats for the UCSD men's basketball game against Fresno 
Pacific but instead of being able to stretch out along three rows of 
bleachers like we had planned. people stormed in and filled up 
the place. forcing us to scrunch up into a ball like cats. and stick 
our heads up In t he air toget oxygen. We had hoped to di scu~~ the 
relevance of the archeological findings in the Middle East. but 
the place was filled Wit h a bunch of obnuxlO\I~ loudmouths, 
screaming in our ears. To make matters worse, instead of 
viewing a game wit h one team clearly beating t he other, we had 
to Sit through two hours of frustration as the lead kept going 
back and forth. Our patience finally ran out when the final 
buzzer sounded and the score was till tied. When the fans were 
on their feet screaming and chanting during the overtime period, 
we left with migraines. vowing newr to set foot in Triton 
Pavillion again! We now urge you to support the 
administration's claim that athletics and academics can not go 
hand in hand. After this debacle we have become firm believers. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Bob Goodman's 70-foot 
d rive and lay up at the buzzer. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Is the UCSD men's basket ball team 
as good as their coaching staff believes? According toJohn Block 
and Tom Marshall. the Tritons, along with Westmont, are to 
rule the league this year. Embarrassing losses to BIOla and 
Southern Cal College indicate that this team perf()rm~ hke 
oe.a'>ants at time~ . [f not for narrow \ictorie.., ()\ er Azusa PaCific 
and Fre~no Pacific, the Tritons would be ]·t. \\ Ith their lone \\'\11 
commg O\'er a pathetic Cal ·Tech club. If thiS team has ambitions 
ot going to Kansas City for the NAIA pla~'offs . they're fooling 
t hemselyes unless their quality of play Impro\ es. H not, the onl y 
reason they would board a plane bound for KC IS to catch the 
Royals' home opener. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. According to (Jur Asian RUllllillg 
Thoughts correspondent "Ghingu~. " l'CSD baseball coach Lyle 
Yates ha~ achle\ ed the ultimate m trickery. As the Triton 
baseball team was lea\'lng Chma, Yates somehow managed to 
smuggle aboard the plane three bilingual Chmese ba ... eball 
players who will join the team this season . Two of Ihe three are 
conSidered ~uper..,tars by the Chinese press, each hanng been 
named to t he "All-China" team forthreeconsecuti\'e vears. Wit h 
these new players . PCSO should be able to challenge perennial 
powers U C and ArilOna State this year. Ghingus has informed 
us that government officiai'i m China are on t heir way to l ' l1Ited 

St a te~ as t his column goes to print.
