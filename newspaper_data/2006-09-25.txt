Amid allegations that the University 
of California Board of Regents fre-
quently circumvent their own finan-
cial practices in compensating execu-
tives, ,UC President Robert C. Dynes 
announced that reforms to increase 
the transparency and openness of the 
financial process will soon be imple-
mented universitywide to protect 
against future controversy. 

UC officials have been under fire 
for several months after independent 
studies and audits alleged that mil-
lions of doUan of university money 
had been improperly spent and undis-
closed by top-ranking officials. The 
UC Compensation, Accountability 
and Transparency task force called the 
integrity of the regents' disclosure pro-
gram Into question, claiming that the 
current UC policy is -outdated" and 
"'wholly unacceptable." According to

veteran plans to step

AsSOCIATI: NEWS EDITOR 

To older alumni, he is the found-
ing provost of Thurgood Marshall 
College. To the current generation, 
he is the sometimes-overprotective 
vice chancellor of student affairs, 
and to the administration, he is a 
man of intelligence, patience and 
dedication. 

No matter which view one holds, 
all who know Joseph W. Watson 
would agree that he has been a con-
stant force, driving the transforma-
tion of this campus since its infancy. 
Watson recently announced that he 
will retire this June, ending a 4O-year 
chapter in UCSO histo(y. 

Watson entered UCSD amid the 
active political and social climate of 
the 1960s. He started as an assistant 
chemistry profasor in 1966, but the 
revolutionary times accelerated his 
administrative involvement 

In addition to the pursuit of pro-
fessorship, Watson worked concur-
rently as the first facuhy advUer to 
the Black Student Union in 1968. His 
involvement in the BSU began his 
deep commitment to the enrollment

UC Davis to Rescue 
Wild Cheetahs 

Two veterinary specialists from 
UC Davis recently embarked on 
a journey to Africa this summer 
to help save wild cheetahs from 
extinction. 

Autumn Davidson and Tomas 
Baker worked in conjunction 
with the Smithsonian Institute for 
a three-week conservation proj-
ect at the Cheetah Conservation 
Fu nd International Research and 
Education Centre in Na mibia. The 
world's largest cheetah reserve is 
committed to ensuring the survival 
of the cheetah, whose future is 
threatened by disease and natural 
disaster because of its small gene 

pool. The UC Davis research team 
focused its efforts on better under-
standing the reproductive biol-
ogy of captive female cheetahs in 
order to identify the best time to 
harvest eggs, and to understand 
why the females' fertility declines 
after eight years of age, according 
to Davidson. Captive cheetahs, 
amounting to about 1,400 in some . 
65 countries, comprise approxi-
mately 1 0 percent of the world's 
remaining cheetah population. 

Hawaiian Crickets 
lose Sexual Song 

In fewer than 20 generations, 
male crickets on Kauai, Hawaii, 
underwent a mutation that dis-
abled their use of song to attract 
female crickets, UC Riverside 
evolutionary biologists found in 
a recent study. 

Although 90 percent of male 
crickets in Kauai lost their ability 
t9 produce sexual Signals, the 
males were still able to repro-
duce successfully, suggesting 
that compensatory behaviors can 
overcome harmful mutations. 
The observations remained con-
si stent with evolutionary theory, 
wh ich sugge sts that mutations 

. can occur to improve the fi t-
ness of the species. Researchers 
concluded that the loss of song 
occurred to protect cri ckets from 
pa rasi tic fl ies that used the songs 
to locate hosts. In addition, they 
noticed that the muta ted, flat -
wi nged fl ies behave like ·satel-

Governor Agrees to 
Minimum Wage Hike 
Current wage will jump 
to $8 by January 2008, 
sparking mixed 
reactions across the 
state. 

By Matt L'Heureux 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

For the first time in over four 
years, the California minimum wage 
will increase, to 58 per hour over the 
next year and a half, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger announced last 
month. 

The current state minimum wage 
is $6.75 per hour, but will increase 
75 cents on Jan. 1, 2007, and an 
additional 50 cents the following 
year. 

"I have always said that when 
the economy was ready, we should 
reward the efforts of California's 
hardworking families by raising our 
minimum wage," Schwarzenegger 
told the Los Angeles Times. "This is 
another sign California is coming 
back stronger than ever." 

According to the California 
Federation of Labor, the 50·cent 
increase will propel California to 
the fourth -highest minimum wage 
in the nation, well above the fed-
eral minimum wage of S5. 15 per 
hour. Washington, Oregon and 
Connecticut are the only states that 
will surpass California's average 
when the increase takes place. 

Schwarzenegger, who had rejected 
similar bills in the last two years, 
finally approved the increase after 
working with Democratic party offi-
cials, leading some to believe that it 
was a calculated decision to appear 
more politically moderate in an elec-
tion year. 

Mit's a long time coming, and 
frankly the reason it's coming is 
because this is a political year; Labor 
Federation Secretary-Treasurer Art 
Pulaslti told the Los Angeles Times. 

The news will benefit over a mil-
lion Californians who are currently 
working minimum wage jobs. 

"California's most vulnerable 
workers will be getting a larger 
boost in their pay and quicker than 
we had hoped for; Assembly Speaker 
Fabian Nuftez (D· Los Angeles) said. 

However, not all officials are 
entirely exuberant about the aug-
mented wage, with some univer-
sity and student leaders claiming , 
it still doesn't do enough to make 
secondary education affordable to 
everyone. 

"Today's signing of the mini, 
mum wage increase is a huge victory 
won by workers who have fought 
long and hard to see this day," UC 
Student Association President Bill 
Shiebler stated in a press release. 
"Yet, it is only a partial solution 
to the affordability crisis affecting 
California's working students and 
families. Fees are stiJI unafford-
able for low-income and middle-
income families and financial aid 
continually fails to meet the needs 
of Californians:' 

Some lawmakers, however, are 
pleased that the bill did not lock 
them into annual salary hikes. 

"We are hap'PY to see that there 
is no indexing or cost-of-living 
increases as part of this package;' 
Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce President Gary Toebben 
told the Times. "This means that any 
future increases have to be debated 
and sold on their merits.»

Herrera Blames Snafu on Clerical Errors 
• HEIUtEIlA, from pase 1 
political party to win an executive 
seat on the 2006-07 A.S. Council. 
submitted a letter of resignation 
on Aug. II, citing personal issues 
as the reason for his departure, 
according to A.S. President Harry 
Khanna. 

"I Herrera) was interested in 
the affairs of Ithe) A.S. ICouncil), 
but it's just not his thing; Khanna 
said. 

Leaving behind job duties 
including a project to increase the 
number of students registered to 
vote, Herrera's resignation came 
as a welcome solution to poor job 
performance, according to several 
A.S. councilmembers. 

"He wasn't on top of his stuff 
and he didn't have a clue what 
he was doing," Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Senior Senator Erik 
Rodriguez·Palacios said. "He was 
getting closer and closer to being 
called incompetent." 

In addition to poor job per· 
formance, Herrera often sealed 
himself away from other council· 
members, which impeded council 
cohesiveness, according to an A.S. 
councilmember who declined to 
be identified due to the sensitive 
nature of the resignation. 

"He didn't interact much with 
councilmembers; the council-
member said, "He had his own 
agenda:' 

Ultimately, it was Herrera's 
inability to work cooperatively and 
productively that led to his resig-
nation , according to the council-
member. 

Herrera, though, dismissed the 
idea that he was uncooperative, 
and cited "personal reasons" as the 
cause of his departure. 

"I think I'm a strong student 
leader, but in this case I was forced 
to make the decision Ito resignl ," 
he said. 

Shortly after Herrera left the 

council. however, allegations of 
financial misconduct on the former 
vice president external's part arose, 
stemming from the improper reim-
bursement of money Herrera used 
to attend a UC Student Association 
Electoral Action Training confer-
ence in May at UCLA, according to 
another A.S. council member who 
also declined to be identified. 

According to the councilmem· 
ber, after a UCSA representative 
notified Khanna and Campus 
Organizing Director Long Pham, a 
Thurgood Marshall College junior 

........... I'm a strong 
aent leader, but in 

this case I was forced

- Eddie Herrera, Former A.S. 

Vice President External 

who worked under Herrera in the 
external affairs department, about 
the improper use of.student funds, 
Khanna double-checked Herrera's 
receipts and noticed a discrepancy. 

According to the counciImem· 
ber, Herrera brought his girlfriend 
- a non-UCSD student - to the 
conference and paid for her $ 10 
registration fee. When he submit· 
ted receipts to be reimbursed for 
costs relating to the E.A.T. con-
ference, however, he included the 
extra money as part of the reim· 
bursement package, the council-
member said, and was reimbursed 
for both registration fees, a total 
ofS20. 

Herrera, however, called the 
reimbursement issue a "misunder· 
standing," citing miscommunica· 
tion problems as the cause of the 

discrepancy. 
According to Herrera, his 

girlfriend did accompany him to 
the conference - driving him to 

, UCLA because he did not have 
a valid driver license at the time 
- but paid for herself at the time 
of registration. When he asked 
for a receipt, he said the UCSA 
staff members issued him one in 
the amount of $10, reflecting only 
his payment. Herrera then left the 
conference the same day, but upon 
his return to UCSD, misplaced the 
receipt issued to him by UCSA, 
and had to obtain a duplicate copy 
in order to be reimbursed properly 
within the allotted time frame. 

UCSA, Herrera said, faxed 
another receipt to UCSD, but wrote 
520 on it erroneously, not realizing 
that his girlfriend had paid for 
herself. 

Amanda Martin, a field orga-
nizer for UCSA, confirmed that 
the receipt sent to the A.S. Council 
was for two people, but indicated 
that Herrera had submitted the 
total payment. 

"The receipt I wrote I Herrera] 
back in April was for S20 reflect-
ing the payment UCSA received," 
Martin stated in an e· mail. "The cost 
per person for the E.A.T. was $10 .. . 
The receipt was issued simply to 
reflect the payment UCSA received 
from IHerrera] and how many stu-
dents the payment was for:' 

Herrera said that further mis-
communication exacerbated the 
problem, and that he rea lized 
UCSA's error but submitted the 
receipt to A.S. Fund Manager Peili 
Hsu anyway, asking her to ignore 
the amount written on Ihe receipt 
and fill out the reimbursement 
forms in the amount of SIO.

cated from Associated Students to

Aid for Californians or Criminals 1 

Restrictions on Education 
Bill Make It Worthwhile 

By Nathan Miklos 
OPINION EDITOR 

Most Americans would agree that chil-
dren should only be held accountable for 
their own decisions, and not those of their 
parents. Moreover, most Americans would 

high school for at least three years, either 
graduated or obtained the equivalent GED 
and then enrolled at an accredited univer-

have been living in the state for several years

advantage of the expand~1i access to fmancial

ship without shouldering their fair 
share of tbe burdens that come 

PRO Second, AB 540 stipulates that students without lawful immigra-
along with it. Right? 

SB 160, a controversial bill by State Sen. 
Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) that would per-
mit some illegal immigrants to apply for cer-
tain financial aid programs, is a compromise 
that fits within both of these parameters. 

The bill would make it possible for stu-
dents admitted to California coUeges under 
AB 540 to apply for financial aid that does 
not require the filing of the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid. AB ·540, passed by 
the state legislature in 2001, modified the 
education code to permit undocumented 
immigrants to pay in -state tuition rates at 
California universities - but only under cer-
tain circumstances. And those restrictions are 
key to the fairness of this bill. 

First, because B 160 affects on ly those 
stud ents accepted uoder AB 540, it does not 
si mply dole financial aid to anyone who can 
beg, bo rrow or steal their way across the 
California state line. ( ice try, O regon ian .) 
To qual if . for in ·state tui tion und er A B 540, 
a .,lUdent must have attended a ali fornia 

tion status must rue an affidavit 
stating that they have either filed an appli-
cation to legalize their status, or tbat they 
will file one as soon as they become eligible. 
Accordingly, while SB 160 would allow illegal 
immigrants to access benefits, a condition of 
those benefits is that undocumented students 
become naturalized citizens. The bill is, in 
effect, a powerful incentive to naturalize. 

Unfortunately, the most strident critics 
of SB 160 often overlook these two cave-
ats. Somewhat mystifyingly, tbe most pas-
sionate supporters of the bill usually don't 
bother to mention the conditions, either. An 
unfortunate consequence of this parallel lack 
of information is that the debate typically 
devolves into a verbal fist fight , with angry 
pro-immigration humanists on orie side and 
equally angry anti- immigration protection -
ists on the other. 

But the vitriol from both sides obscures 
those two points 011 which mo t Americans

Drug Reps a Double-Edged Sword 
Through drug sampies 
and inlormation, 
pharmaceutical reps 
serve hospitals as well 
as themselves. 

By MtgJum Durhaa 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Reform bills in the last year 
have worked to increase scrutiny 
of lobbyists in Congress, arguing 
what seems to be no more than 
common sense: If Interest groups 
lavish attention on politicians, 
politicians are more likely to be 
favorably biased toward them. 

But what has been described as 
the -inlluence trade' doesn't stop 
at Capitol Hill. The medical world 
has lobbyists as well, coming in 
the form of drug representatives 
from major pharmaceutical com-
panies. Recent regu1ations created 
at Stanford University have aimed 
to control the problem - but in 
the complicated world of modern 
medicine, they may do as much 
barm as good. 

Under a policy that takes effect 
Oct. I , pharmaceutical sales reps 
are prohibited from any gift-giv-
ing on school, hospital or clin-
ic grounds; are not allowed in

from engaging in "ghostwriting." 
a process in which drug compa-
nies write articles for academic 
researchers who then claim the 
work as their own. 

Philip Pizzo, dean of Stanford 
Univenity's medical school. argued 
that the change was necessary. 

-In recent years we have wit-

nessed an erosion of the public 
trust in the profession of medicine 
and even in the value of science; 
he said. "We were really seeking to 
do the right thing:' 

Certain aspects of thIs policy 
seem perfectly reasonable. Few 
would argue that allowing drug 
companies to write papen for 
researchers or permitting drug reps 
to bother doctors within patient 
areas without an appointment are 

" m1 tho. the 
sponsors do get their 

names displayed 
aaoss conference 
materials and can 

enter the subconscious 
of attendees, 

phannaceutical 
companies aren't 

allowerd to be overtly 
manipulative." 

ethical practices. But certain pro-
hibitions in this policy are causing 
a great deal of controversy. 

Take Anne Yoshino: she's prac-
ticed medicine for over 23 years, 
dealing with more than her share 
of drug companies and their repre-
sentatives. She admits that she feels 
a little guilty taking clipboards and 
pens from drug companies because 
it is unethical, but dislikes that 
the ban prohibits free samples of 
drugs. 

"Especially for things like birth 

control, which affects everyone dif-
ferently, it is nice to have options; . 
Yoshino said. For her, and like-
minded doctors, free samples of 
drugs allow doctors to find the best 
fit for their patient, regardless of 
brand name. 

For drugs like beta-blockers, 
whIch are commonJy used to treat 
heart disease and hIgh blood pres-
sure and tend to work the same 
way no matter who is talcing them, 
pharmaceutical reps are useful in 
that they are usually well-informed 
about the products they are selling. 

"They are quite willing to tell 
you exactly how their drug differs 
from others, whether it has a longer 
half life or is easier for the patient 
to take,» YoshinO said. "Although 
you do have to take what they say 
with a grain of salt." 

If a doctor is willing to remain 
objective and listen to representa-
tives from several companies - as 
well as use their own judgment 
- drug reps can be a valuable 
source of information. 

Michelle Vaccaro, a former 
nurse, has a different take: She 
argues that the drug companies are 
vital to reducing the cost of contin-
ued education for medical profes-
sionals, an aspect that applies more 
to nurses than to doctors. Drug 
companies are known for sponsor-
ing conferences for medical profes-
sionals to discuss the latest news 
and discoveries in the medical 
realm, leaving the attendees to pay 
only for the price of their lodging 
and transportation. 

Furthermore, the Accreditation 
Council on Continuing Medical 
Education accredits most confer-
ences and requires tbem to be 
unbiased and not controlled by 
·commercial interests." So even

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR -
Enjoy the Scripps 

Reserve Responsibly 
Dear Editor, 

Have you ever visited the Scripps . 
Knoll (commonly know as the Cliffs, 
located west of Muir College) and 
wondered how this amazing natural 
area exists amid the dense develop-
ment of La Jolla and UCSD? 

The knoll is part of the Scripps 
Coastal Reserve, an area protected 
by the UC Regents for teaching and 
research; it is not an improved park 
or a recreation area. Smoking. pic-
nicking and camping are not allowed. 
Please come only on foot (no bicy-
cles - there's parking for them at the 
entrance), sign yourself in when you 
arrive and out when you leave, pay 
careful attention to the guidelines for 
visitors and make sure to stay on the 
main loop trail illustrated in the free 
brochure. 

Access to the beach is not from 
the knoll, only via the paved Black's 
Canyon Road, a quarter of a mile 
north along La Jolla Farms Road. The 
bluff tops and cliffs themselves, the 
area within the loop, and the area 
south of the loop are dosed to the pub-
lic, for resource protection, research 
or for safety reasons. Please respect 
marked boundaries and other signs. 
From the trail, many species of plant, 
bird, reptile, insect and marnma1 can 
be observed, and an observation stop 
at the westernmost point on the trai1 
(next to the closed restoration area) 
offers a view of the Pacific Ocean, lOcal 

beaches and breathtaking sunsets. 
Be sure to leave the reserve within 

15 minutes after sunset to avoid being 
locked in when the entry is closed at 
dusk! Groups larger than 20 require 
a pennit (see below). Please pick up 
a guide to the biodiversity trai1 at the 
entrance kiosk, and continue to visit, 
admire and learn; but keep in mind 
that you are visiting. and respect those 
species to which the knoll is home. 

Scripps Coastal Reserve is main-
tained by the UCSD Natural Reserve 
System and encompasses both the 
knoll and Scripps beach. Acc~s to 
the knoll is via La Jolla Farms Road to 
the west of the Muir College campus. 
For group use,.·including by campus 
organizations and classes, or further 
information, please call Isabelle Kay

Tackling the Boredom Problem Head On Some Limits 
on Drug Reps 

Necessary 
By Nathan Mililos 
OPINION EDITOR 

When you first get to UCSD, 
eve rything seems hunky-dory. 

It's a top-notch research cam-
pus, and students are surrounded 
by millions of federal research dol-
lars and faculty members at the top 
of their game. And then there are 
the fringe benefits: the beautiful 
campus, the beach that's just down 
the street. You might complain 
about the weather. if the 75-degree 
cloudless days wouldn't keep lull-
ing you to sleep before you get a 
chance. 

But once the excitement of new-
ness wears off, many of UCSD's 
IS-year-olds, some still giddy with 
newfound freedom from the watch -
ful eye of their parents, gradually 
come to an unhappy realization. 

"I'm bored:' And how. 
Last year's Undergraduate 

Stullent Experience and Satisfaction 
report went a long way in catalog-
ing the discontent of the average 
UCSD student. Students com-
plained about a lack of belonging 
and engagement compared to other 
UC chools. 

Where are the zany people with 
faces painted blut} and gold, jumping 
up and down for no better reason 
than the fact that 1,000 other people 
are doing it, and having fun? 

At the majority of UCSD sports 
games, the noise from the crowd 
is barely enough to compete with 
the noise of the crickets behind 
the bleachers or the squeaking 
of sneakers on hardwood. Even 
the A.S. Council's heroic efforts 
to bribe students into coming to 
sporting events with free T-shirts 
and knick-knacks have generally 
failed . Compared to students at, 
say, San Diego State, UCSD kids 
just don't seem too interested in 
sports. 

And why not? 
The stereotypical answer is that 

UCSD stud ents are too focused 
on academics, and that low atten-
dance is only a logical result . But 
UCSD draws from roughly the 
same student pool as UC Berkeley 
and UCLA - schools that have no 
problem filling whole stadiums to 
capacity. Are we really to believe 
that La Jolla manages to attract only 
noninterested (or noninteresting) 
students? 

There's certainly no shortage 
of winning home teams to root 
for. The women's soccer team is 
ranked 11 th in the nation, and has 
won five of the 

done reading this article, get 15 of 
your friends to go to the next men's 
soccer game (this Friday, Sept. 29, 
against Sonoma State, 4:30 p.m., 
RIMAC field) . Even if you don't 
care about soccer - just do it. 
Pretend it's the World Cup. 

And involvement in sports is 
barely scratching the surface. What 
else could UCSD use? 

Except during finals week, 
UCSD has no 24-hour store, restau-
rant or hang-out place. How often 
do you find yourself scrambling to 
get to Ocean View Terrace before it 
closes, only to be coldly denied at 
the door and faced with an unhap-

py trek to 
Ralphs? And last six California 

Collegiate 
Athletic 
Association 
championships . 
The men's water 
polo team is 
ranked fifth in 
the CCAA, while 
women's volley-
ball is a solid 13th. 
Or break a trend, 

, 

d after all, who after all, who wants to 
hang out at 
Ralphs at 2 
a.m., except 
that one guy 
with the 
beard ? 

ants to hang out 
at Ralphs at 2 a.m., 
except that one guy 
with the beard?" You can 

wait for the 
university 
administra -try something 

wild - go check out the kendo 
team. UCSD sent two squads to 
Harvard's national kendo tourna-
ment, placing second and third. 

If winning is no object, be a 
sport and cheer for the men's vol-
leyball team. Maybe a little pat on 
the back will help the team turn it 
around . (Last year, they took down 
Stanford in an upset victory - you 
never know.) 

Granted, the Division I UC 
schools and SDSU have a historic 
tradition of athletic competit ion 
that the relatively young UCSD 
- founded 1959, 40 years after 
UCLA and 130 after UC Berkeley 
- can't hope to match. But what 
does it matter if we have traditions 
or not? Start one. Once you're 

tion to create something shiny and 
awkward, or you can contact your 
A.S. Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations (Sydney Goldberg, 
telephone: (858) 534-5254, e-maH: 
sgoldber@ucsd.edu) and make one 
yourself. 

UCLA's student government 
runs several restaurants and a 
trademark service; Stanford's con-
trols a bank that manages 56 mil -
lion, and a professional Web design 
business. Is the best we can do 
the A.S. Lecture Notes and a half-
hearted plan for a store in the 
expanded Price Center? 

How about a student-run com-
puter repair and troubleshoot -
ing serv ice? Technicians from 
Academic Computing Services 

charge a minimum of $25 simply 
to look at your computer. and 550 
for every hour it takes to fix the 
problem. (It costs even more if you 
want them to come to you.) Might 
there be any tech -savvy undergrads 
willing to fix computers for, say, 
$40 an hour - or less? 

Or maybe someone could set 
up a writing workshop and editing 
service, to help out all those who 
struggle through writing-heavy 
GEs. Talk to your student represen-
tatives and make it happen. 

Students have lamented the lack 
of a des'ignated spot to vent frus-
trations, like London's Speaker's 
Corner or Berkeley's Sproul Plaza. 
So make one! The Hump outside 
the Main Gym, the concrete slabs 
at the bottom of the Snake Path, 
or the stonehenge-looking thing 
south of Galbraith are all perfect 
candidates.

According to last year's U.S.E.S. 
report: 

"Student satisfaction (along all 
dimensions) was greater for stu-
dents who participated in activi-
ties, such as study abroad, UCDC 
and independent research, than for 
those students who did not engage 
in such activities." 

No surprise there. If you get 
involved, you'll be happier. The 
U.S.E.S. report would never lie. 
Moral of the story: If there's any-
thing that stands between you and 
a university you love attending, go 
out and do something about it. 
You have nothing to lose but your 
regrets. 

• DRUGS, from page 5 
though the sponsors do get their 
names emblazoned on all confer-
ence materials and can enter the 
subconscious of attendees, pharma-
ceutical companies aren't allowed 
to overtly manipulate information. 
Meanwhile, their money does a 
lot of good improving the medical 
profession. 

Perhaps the biggest problem 
with the increaSingly significant 
interaction between pharmaceuti-
cal companies and hospitals is that 
the medical profession has in some 
ways become dependent on drug 
companies, both for funding and as 
a source of information. Now that 
this relationship has been formed, it 
may prove difficult to break. 

There must of course be limits 
to the access that representatives 
have to doctors; but even before 
the official policy, these limits have 
been enforced by individual offices 
and hospitals. Both Yoshino and 
Vaccaro discussed working in situ-
ations where pharmaceutical rep-
resen tatives were forced to make 
appointments with a designated 
member of the team in order to 
meet with the rest of the doctors 
instead of a1lowi.ng them free reign 
of the floor. 

There must also be limits to what 
pharmaceutical company reps can 
gift to individual doctors. though 
the jury is still out about forbidding 
even drug samples. However, this 
is an issue that individual medical 
organizations will have to decide for 
themselves. For some. severing the 
ties may be easy; for others, it may 
be close to impossit>le. 

But at least they are making an 
effort.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Political Meddling Obscures a Good Bill 
• PRO, from page 4 
responsible for the choices of their 
parents, and no one shou ld lake 
advantage of American citizenship 
without paying their fair share of 
the bargain. 

By permitting undocumented 
children to compete for financial 
aid dollars, we give them the same 
opportunities as Ihe classmates they 
have spent years learning beside 
- regardless of how their parents 
came into the country. But most 
importantly, by offering a chance at 
financial aid only on condition of 
eventual American citizenship, we 
ensure that anyone taking advantage 
of the program is drawn into the 
income tax-paying fold. 

A lack of similar provisions in the 
driver license bill, which Cedillo has . 
been so anxious to pass for the last 
few years, is one of the main reasons 

it has repeatedly failed. (The latest 
version, SB 1162, finally requires an 
affidavit of intent to apply for citi-
zenship as a prerequisite for obtain-

ow bad should

system?" 

ing a license.) 
Without naming names, several 

Democratic politicians have tried 

to sell SB 160 by invoking the plight 
of undocumented children, while 
at the same time arguing that since 
these kids have been in California 
schools for years - free of cost 
to them and their parents, mind 
you - they are essentially de facto 
American residents. While this non-
sensical argument might earn a few 
votes from sympathetic constituents, 
it does nothing to win over the vot-
ers who actually pay for the state's 
education system. How bad should 
Californians feel for students who 
are getting a free ride in the K -12 
school system? 

But the political wrangling of the 
SB 160's proponents does not make 
it a bad piece of legislation. With the 
conditions on financial aid dearly 
stated, Gov. Arnold Schwanenegger 
should sign the bill on his desk into 
law before the end of the month. 

Handout Too Costly for Debt-Ridden State 
• CON, from page 4 
again missed the mark. Difficulties 
in paying for college are not what 
punish students in this tate, illegal 
or not. Students in this state are 
punished by the substandard high 
schools, junior high schools and 
elementary schools that they must 
attend - and which have yet to 
show significant improvement, no 
matter how much political effort has 
been devoted to them. 

That is what prevents children 
from obtaining the level of education 
they'll Ileed to continue on in life. If 
California's budget deficit is allowed 

to grow, the state's children will inherit 
a crippled or even failing economy. 
Those should be our politicians' pri -
0rities. But we are being successfully 
misdirected, once again, into spending 
money on nonessential services. 

Some supporters argue that the 
bill would not directly give illegal 
immigrants aid, only "lIow them to 
apply for it. But of course this issue 
would not be on the Senate's radar, 
nor would it cost the state university 
system an estimated $7.3 million 
per year, if a significant number 
of illegal immigrant students were 
not known to be in the income 

range that almost guarantees they 
will qualify. Changing the applica-
tion rules to include people who 
almost certainly qualify for aid is 
not significantly different from giv. 
ing aid to them. 

Illegal immigrant students who 
get into a state college have (pre-
sumably) worked hard to be accept-
ed. But the pool of available funds is 
not so plentiful that public universi-
ties can afford to expand their finan -
cial aid budgets by the millions in 
order to accommodate noncitizens. 
The money - and the energy - is 
needed for other priorities. 

Students have saved 
over $12 million so far!

share of savings

Sun God to 
Remain Dry, 
Watson Says 
• GARDEN, from page 1 
certs, which do not include alcohol. 
Despite the previous funding prob-
lems, the reinstated TGs will still be 
free. However, the concerts will be 
limited to one during fall quarter, 
two during' winter and one during 
spring. 

In the past, TGs took place on the 
Hump outside the Student Center, but 
Lam stated that the location for the 
new TGs has yet to be determined. 

"There was an intention of doing 
it on Sun God lawn;' Lam stated. "But 
because Sun God lawn is so massive 
and there is no defined perimeter to 
contain the event, we have had to 
search for alternatives. We are cur-
rently looking at severa1 locations on 
campus and trying to get one location 
approved with the respective depart-
ments." 

A major point of contention among 
students, the A.s. Council and Watson 
last year was the availability of alcohol 
at campus events. At the time, the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction report, MUch was 
compiled last year by a committee 
made up of students, staff and alumni 
and detailed campus life, stated, "The 
campus should either bring back TGs 
or create a new regular event fulfilling 
these needs." 

The report stated that UCSD 1acked 
the strong campus community stu-
dents had previously enjoyed. 

"[The campus needs) a regu1ar 
event that students could look forward 
to and reflect positively upon after they 
graduate;' the report stated. 

Many A.S. councilmembers 
pushed to bring back beer gardens, 
including former Revelle College 
Senior Senator Rachel Cerell. 
However, Watson rejected a pro-
posal for a beer garden at Sun God, 
despite the inclusion of a safety plan 
by the A.S. Council. 

·We were under the impression 
that if we applied ourselves toward 
safety concerns, we would be able 
to have a beer garden," former A.S. 
President Jenn Pae said last year. 
"To have the idea be rejected was 
very sad.· 

Watson said that Sun God and 
TGs are different regarding alcohol 
because of their difference in size. 
However, now that TGs are return-
ing. beer gardens will come back as 
well. The A.S. Council is planning 
the first TG for Oct. 20. 

"I think this is one event that will

ing a greater UCSD community that

stated. "The fun portion of the event is 
what we are aiming for, not the beer." 

Both Watson and the A.S. Council 
say that safety is the main concern 
regarding TGs. Because of the beer 
garden. extra security precautions 
will be taken to ensure that drink-
ing is restricted to students of age. 
These precautions indude increased 
private security for the event and sev-
eral meetings with the UCSD Police 
Department. 

"Anyone caught passing alcohol 
to underage drinkers will be turned 
over to [the) police department;' Lam 
stated. 

H~, according to Lam. there 
will be no new ru1es regulating TGs. 

"As far as I'm concerned, there 
are DO new regulations governing the

One Down, Thre.e to Go for Nurses 
After stalled talks, 
UC and nurses union 
agree on retirement 
plan. Several issues 
still remain unsolved . 

By Charles Nguyen 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Rocky talks between the 
University of California and its nurs-
es made progress over the summer, 
but negotiato.rs are still lacking an 
agreement in several areas, includ -
ing wages and health benefits. 

In July, negotiators were able to 
senIe on a standard retirement pack-
age for UC nurses, following Several 
heated sessions that seemingly hit 
a standstill the month before when 
the university accused the California 
Nurses Association. the union rep-
resenting UC nurses, of "unfair 
labor practices." In the charge, filed 
with the Public Employee Relations 
Board, the university claimed that 
CNA was uncompromising and 
using "bad-faith negotiating tac-
tics." 

In the last few months, the uni -
versity has continually accused 
union officials of breaching "good: 
faith" talks, and sent a letter to the 
union in August outlining their con -
cerns. 

"(1)n the spirit of a constructive 
process that will bring forth a good 
result for our nurses, our patients 
and the university. I would implore 
you to encourage the union to com-
municate honestly and forthrightly," 
UC Associate Director of Labor 
Relations Gayle Cieszkiewicz stated 
in the letter to union director Beth 
Kean for UC negotiations. 

Meanwhile, CNA officials have 
accused the university of allying 
with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
who tried to reduce nurse pensions 

and staffing ratios governing state 
hospitals in 2005. The union also 
threatened a strike in July 2005, but 
was stopped after PERB won a state 
court injunction on the walkout. 

"Unfortunately, we do not believe 
CNA has approached the negotia-
tions with ... commitment, as evi-
denced by the union's failures to 
propose substantive proposals and 
its repeated strike threats, which 
began even before bargaining start -
ed;' UC Executive Director of Labor 
Relations Howard Pripas stated in a 
June press release. 

The union's form of diplomacy 

J'. e union has tried 
"to bring its political . 

agenda into 
negotiations?' 

- Noel Van Nyhuis, 
Spokesman, University 
Office of the President 

set the bitter tone in negotiations, 
UC officials said. 

"CNA has held a long and pub-
lic battle with the governor," UC 
Office of the President spokesman 
Noel Van Nyhuis stated in a June 
e-mail. "The union has attempted 
to try to bring [its) political agenda 
into negotiations, however, it has 
nothing to do with negotiating a 
contract for UC nurses and only 
serves to st ifle progress at the bar-
gain ing table." 

CNA's propositions are meant to 
attract more to a declining number 
of California nurses. according to 
Kean. The university refuted the 
union's claims, presenting reports 
that showed a 13.5-percent salary 
hike for UC nurses in 2005. In 

response, union officials attacked 
the statistic. 

"Numbers can be presented in 
any way to prove the point you're 
trying to make:' Kean stated in 
June. "[The university is) using [its) 
numbers politically." 

Kean said that the university 
used numbers from select low-pajd 
local areas to boost its own image 
in comparison. UCLA Medical 
Center nurses participated in a rally 
to protest the university's stance on 
staffing issues. 

"This is one of the wealthiest 
and most profitable hospital sys-
tems in California, yet they refuse 
to spend this money where it 
should be spent, on patient care; 
stated Emmanuel Punzalan, a nurse 
who works at the center, in a press 
release. "We have been unable to 
recruit and retain area nurses, in 
large part because RN salaries are 
significantly less than other area 
hospitals. We are fighting to ensure 
that our patients are cared for by 
alert , experienced RN staff." 

This year's negotiations - part 
of the university's revisi t to key 
parts of its two-year contract with 
UC nurses - began in April, but 
stalled on resolving four issues: 
wages, meal breaks and health and 
retirement benefits. Both sides 
declared an "impasse" in June. and 
resorted to "fact -finding" sessions 
to reconcile issues. 

As of August, three fact -finding 
sessions were completed between 
the university and union, and offi -
cials will continue the meetings in 
late September. If a settlement is 
not reached during the meeting, 
the three-member panel governing 
the process will recommend a fmal 
contract for UC and union officials 
to consider.

10 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Watson Still Frustrated By Low Numbers of Minorities 
~ WATSON, from page 1 
and education of underrepresented 
students, an effort that Watson has 
continued to date. 

Upon recognizing Watson's 
understanding and passion for the 
issues at hand, UCSD named him the 
first provost of Third College, today's 
Thurgood MarshaU ollege, which 
aimed to add ress the campus' need for 
multicultural education' and diversity. 

According to Watson, while he 
faced opposition and controversy in 
trying to carry out the goals of the 
college, specifically admitting larger 
numbers of minority students and 
faculty, the idea of Third College is 
still valuable because it was a reflec-
tion of the hopes, dreams and aspira-
tions of the underrepresented com-
munities. 

One of the major frustrations of 
his 40-year career is the lack of prog-
ress in the representation of students 
from key races. The similar challenges 
that still exist today result from insti-

tutionali~ problems, exemplified in 
the passing of Proposition 209, he 
said. 

"If you have a problem, you have 
to be able to focus on the problem in 
order to solve and address it;' Watson 
said. "By not allowing any consider-
ation of race and ethnidty. it's almost 
a recipe for not being able to solve the 
problem in a direct way:'

the area of representation. Watson has 
made numerous strides in the right 
direction without ever compromising

dent position, according to Spriggs; 
however, some call Watson's effort

", hate to think where UCSD 
would be without him in terms of 
diversity; Spriggs said. 

Watson left his post as provost in 
1981 when offered the position of vice

responsible for regulating a $34-mil-
lion budget and the numerous facets 
that envelop student life. including

Harry Khanna. 
<OA vice chancellor Ishould] aUow 

students to make their own mistakes 
because this is an educational institu-
tion;' Khanna said. "Students need to 
have real decision-making power on 
this campus. Were here for education, 
not just in the classroom but also in 
student life:' 

One example where Watson did 
attempt to stand back and let students 
make decisions was in the Student-
Run Television issue, according to 
Spriggs. He supported the student 
position through the first and sec-
ond incidents until there was almost 
an aUeged physical confrontation, he 

said. 
"His normal response when issues 

arise is to say. 'Hey, it's all right, we 
can take our hit,· Spriggs said "Ha:! 
rather just let things flow their course 
toward a resolution." 

While Watson may have held an 
easygoing attitude at the beginning. 
he was not afraid to usurp power over 
the station ilirough the acceptable use 
policy which followed, Khanna said 

"Dr. Watson is God as far as the 
lpolicy) is involved;' Khanna said last 
March. "He is the judge, jury and 
executioner:' 

Another controversy of his term 
centered around the structure and 
accountability of the campus' co-ops. 
which are owned and operated inde-
pendently from the uninversity. 

The co-ops were often sources 
of student organization and control 
over issues, especially administrative 
efforts to raise student fees, according 
to Graduate Student Association Vice 
President Internal Dana Bahlstrom. 

The administration wanted more 
oversight over the co-ops. leading to 
the establishment of a new contract 
that aUowed for more control and 
easier eviction. he said. 

"In the example with the co-ops, 
there was too much student control," 
Spriggs said.

Regents Deny 
Compensation 
Wrongdoings 

• REGENTS, from page 1 
the studies, top administrators were 
frequently given perks which were not 
divulged to the public, such as housing 
benefits and large bonuses. 

In a Sept. 20 press release, Dynes 
stated that procedural inadequacies is 
the key issue fueling the debate, but 
denied any intentional misconduct. 

"While none of the reviews indicat-
ed excessive compensation 1evels, they 
aU pointed to a variety of operational 
shortcomings in the way senior man-
agement compensation. benefits and 
related matters are approved, moni-
tored and reported; Dynes said. "These 
reforms are aimed ~ swiftly and per-
manently correcting those problems so 
they never happen again:' 

In February, Dynes enacted an 
interim policy that would oblige him, 
in consultation with the regents, to 
approve any changes to employment-
related policies for senior management. 
This will remain in effect until the 
completion of a ·comprehensive policy 
review;' U C Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said. 

Along with the task force. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Bureau 
of State Audits and the University 
Auditor also externally audited the 
regents, according to the press release. 

Dynes' new proced ural alterations 
came in the form of a seven-point list, 
tailored to tighten restrictions on those 
who may receive exceptions to the 
financial policy's guidelines and how 
such exceptions must be documented. 
among other things. 

The reforms. Dynes said, reflect the 
university's continuing commitment to 
·public accountability" and the reviews 
stumbled across nothing more than 
"administrative deficiencies." 

One of Dynes' new policies states 
that any exceptions made to traditional 
UC funding policy must be document-
ed, explained and presented to the vice 
presidentl chief compliance and audit 
officer. These financial transactions. 
except when their disclosure may con-
stitute uan unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy; will be matters of 
public record. 

Among the infonnation to be made 
publicly available are any employees 
job description, base salary, stipends. 
bonuses, benefits packages. insurance 
and severance/retirement agreements. 

The university will also provide an 
e1e.--tronic annual report that details 
the compensation for all UC employ-
ees, including executives, Dynes said 
Similarly, official press re1eases regard-
ing regent -approved appointments will 
now include a summary of the recipi-
ent's total compensation. 

In May, the regents requested an 
external consultant in order to help 
develop a comprehensive and detailed 
framework for reviewing and revis-
ing polices related to compensation 
and benefits. According to Schwartz, 
UCOP is completing a ·competitive 
bidding war" in order to obtain the 
consultant's services. 

Th.e consultant's primary duties 
would involve limiting the number 
of externally compensated positions 
and other board positions for senior 
rnaitagers. as weU as analyzing current 
polices for administrative and sabbati-
cal leave. 

Along with the other proposed 
changes. Dynes is also pushing to have 
a dause added to a 1993 compensa-
tion policy that would state the con-
sequences of a serious violation of UC 
pay rules. 

"The regents recognize the 
University of · California's unique 
public trust," Board of Regents 
Chairman Gerald L. Parsky said in 
a press release. "While UC must 
maintain its ability to compete with 
top universities across the nation 
for outstanding researchers, teach-
ers and administrators, 1ft must do 
so in ways that are transparent and 
understandable to the public."

UC Confident 
in Laboratory 

Proposal 
• LAB, from page 9 

At their July meeting, the regents 
appointed national security and 
nuclear weapons expert George H. 
Miller as leader for the bid. 

If the university's bid wins 
the LLNL contract, Miller would 
be named director of the labora-
tory, according to a university press 
release. 

The proposal is expected to 
cost the university about $3 mil-
lion, which will be paid for by past 
income earned at both LLNL and 
LANL, according to Harrington. 

"It will not be funded from state 
funds or student fees," he said. 

The univerSity is hopeful that 
it will secure the LLNL contrac t 
through its bid, which would be due 
to the D.O.E. in early October. 

"Our expectation is that we will 
submit a strong and winning bid 
that is responsive to the Department 
of Energy proposal and the nation-
al security needs of our nation :' 
Harrington said. 

However, not everyone in the 
UC community is happy about the 
university's decision to move for-
ward with the LLNL bid. 

UC Nuclear Free, a UC-wide 
organization made up of students, 
faculty, staff and other members of 
the public, opposes the university's 
position as director of the research 
labs because members are against the 
production of nuclear weapons, and 
has lobbied the university at several

with the nuclear laboratories. 

Although the university recog-

said that the univerSity should reas-

"[The universityl has decided

said. 

However, the National Nuclear 
Security Administration stated on its 
Web site that LLNL eKists "to pre-

said she could not remember Herrera's 
request. 

In addition, she said that A.S. coun-
cilmembers had submitted requests 
to her on numerous occasions to omit 
certain items from reimbursement 
receipts, but that she would always 
e·mall or call the student to verify 
that the requested items had been 
removed from the required forms. 

"To my knowledge, I've never 
made a mistake," Hsu said, regarding 
the omission of requested items from 
reimbursement request forms . 

Herrera also said he never received 
a call or e-mail from Hsu verify-
ing that the extra $10 had not been 
included on the forms. 

After the discovery of the refund 
error, Herrera said he wrote a check 
immediately to pay the money back. 
He also said that he should have 
"double-checked" that Hsu had com-
plied with his request. 

Herrera, who campaigned vigor-
ously last spring to win his executive 
seat, relied on a platform including 
bringing ethics and morality back to 
the scandal-plagued council. Former

A.S. Vice President 'External Kevin 
Mann resigned last year in the wake 
of a discovery that he used student 
fees to buy personal gifts, including 
shot glasses. 

"There are so many things that 

this council has done that have been 
appalling; Herrera said last April after 
his victory had been declared. "We 
need to change the way we deal with 
moral issues, which would help us 
represent the students the way we 
should be." 

Khanna has appointed Pham, who 
has worked in the external affairs 
office for two years. as interim vice 
president external, and will eventually 
appoint a permanent membe.r once 
the application process is over. Any 
student can apply for the position, 
Pham said, and a decision should be 
finalized around third week of this 
quarter. 

Herrera's departure is not a con-

Palacios said.

Watson Credited With Campus Development 
• RmREMENT, from page 10 

Although students can't always 
see Watson's support, it is demon-
strated behind the scenes, Assistant 
Vice ChanceUor of Admissions and 
Registration Mae W Brown said. 

·He is working while some of us 
are sleeping." Brown said. "That kind 
of pace wears you out" . 

AlODg with his dedication, faculty 
members will remember his intellect 
and respect for others, according to 
Spriggs. 

·He's probably the most inte1ligent 
person I'w em' met," Spriggs said "He 
can penetrate even the most compli-
cated financial problems a lot earlier 
than most people, but his patience with 
his staff and colleagues. even when he 
has already figured out the aDSWl!!', is 
remarkable. Most bright people don't 

have that kind of patience:' 
In his 25-year term as vice chancel-

lor of student affairs, Watson is most 
credited with the physical develop-
ment of this campus, most notably for 
the construction of the Career Services 
Center, Price Center and its current 
expansion, RIMAe and the new North 
Campus housing project for transfer 
students. 

He was also involved with the ath-
letics department switch from Division 
III to Division II, increased empha-
sis on study abroad, creation of the 
Faculty Mentor Program and inven-
tion of 1iitonlink. 

This year marks the end of 
Watson's five-year strategic plan, 
which addressed the issue of a grow-
ing campus. Now that many of his 
plans have been completed and stu-

dent growth is predicted to level off 
at 30,000, the campus will reach a 
transitional state. 

Watson has laid the physical 
foundation of student life and now 
it's up to the next vice chancellor 
of student affairs to formulate a 
new strategiC plan to address the 
challenge of implementing new pro-
grams without relying on the funds 
that result from a growing student 
body, Spriggs said. 

"There's no use in trying to dupli-
cate something you can't;' he said. 
· The next vice chancellor will have to 
look at what's already been done and 
see where to go from here. [Watson's 1

• Amount of money l'iIised by Burning 
Man participants to benefit the victims of 

Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 

by M-egan Durham 
SEN lOR STAFF WRITER 

The Burning Man festival attracts thousands each year for a six-day experiment in self-
expression and "radical self-reliance." Many San Diegans, including UCSD students, make 
the trek to Black Rock City, Nev., to participate. One student shares her own experience. 

Just be an extrovert," the self-proclaimed Uncle Ira said at the gate . Sweat was beginning to 
bore holes through his bright pink 
face paint as he adjusted his top hat. 
"Ask questions, get involved, and 
this place will change your life.; he 
said. This was August 28, the first 
of six days in the event known as 
Burning Man. 

To the uninitiated , Burning 
Man probably doesn't sound like an 
event that should be taken seriously. 
Camping on an ancient lakebed in 
the middle of Nevada desert in order 
to burn a giant stick figure? The idea 
is guaranteed to confuse nonburn-
ers. "So it's some kind of effigy 
orgy?" asked Ele~nor Roosevelt 
CoUege senior Andi Barton. Barton 
had a bit of a problem wrapping her 
head around the idea at first. just as 
many others do. 

But while it may seem like an alien 
idea to some, every year over 25,000 
people gather on a geographical Hat-
bed 100 miles north of Reno, Nev. 
The location is known u the playa. 
and the thousands gather to join an 
experiment in community and Mnadl_ 

cal self-expression:' as they caU it. 
Burning Man started in 1986 as 

a summer solstice celebration that 
Larry Harvey thought up to get over 
a bad breakup. But when he and his 
friend Jerry James started burning 
the 8-foot-tall figure on a beach in 
San Francisco, the rest of the beach-
goers came running to watch . 

A community was born, and the 
experience was so profound that 
they decided to repeat it the follow-
ing year. Over the years, as the man 
grew taUer and more intricate, so 
did the community. 

In 1990, it ftnaUy attracted the 
attention of the local authorities. who 
decided to enforce the rules against 
limited beach burns of a three-by-
three-foot campfire. Needless to say, 
the now four-story-tall man did not 
meet these requi.rements. A change 
of venue was needed. 

It was found in the wind-blown 
flatbed of a northern Nevada moun-
tain range, where the event still 
occurs to thil day. What started u 
a limple annual beach party hal 
grown into a thriving village with 
infrastructure, buUt weeks before 

the actual event and torn down once 
it is over. Roads, street signs, power 
lines and communication towers 
appear and disappear in this same

spot each year. just like the campi 
and participants. 

People come from all cornen of 
the &lobe, but mOlt attendees are 
from the historic birthplace of the 
man, California. San Dleso Itself 

contributes a large number of the 
habitual citizens. Communities 
like SDbu rnen.tribe.net and 
sdburningman@groups.yahoo.com 
register over 750 and 980 users 
respectively, while groups like 
Fuegodiego try to keep·the spirit of 
Burning Man alive 365 days a year. 
They put on events like Fuego de los 
Muertos, which takes place an hour 
east of San Diego on Oct. 20-23. 

Walking into the Burning Man 
community was much like walking 
onto the set of lome Mad Max type 
of post apocalyptic movie. Shelters 
against the blazing sun rose hap-
hazardly out of the dust. Toward 
the outside they were mostly tups 
and RV., but a. one approached the 
center, they became works of art. 
Caves of PVC and cloth lay along-
side two-story .tructurn boasting 
fully furnished loungea while geode-

primary mode of transportation 
for most members. but handmade 
vehicles of every shape and size 
lumbered down the packed earth 
streets, keeping to the five miles per 
hour speed limit. 

This year was Muir College 
freshman JR Bachman's first time 
attending the event. Although he 
came on a spur of the moment 
decision, he still manqed to fmd 
a place in two theme camps, • the

Sense of Community Is Central to the Attraction of Burning Man 
~ BURNING, from page 14 

When asked what struck 
Bachman mo t about the Burning 
Man experience he said, "You could 
wear, say and do just about anything 
- as long as it isn't hateful - and 
nobody would even think about 
judging you for it, only compliment-
ing you ." 

But as noisy and interesting as it 
was duri ng the day, it was at night 
that Burning Man really came alive. 
Oppo ite the emi-ci rcle of camps, 
far aero s an emply expanse of sand, 
stood the reason everyone wa there: 

the man. Nearly four stories tall, at 
night he stood illuminated by rings 
of neon blue while a sea of color 
swam before him. 

An astonishingly large number of 
lights blazed at night. Mind-numb-
ingly huge contraptions blared music 
while attendees danced beneath 
strobe lights and disco balls, and 
theme camps came alive with laser 
light shows and pyrotechnic dis-
plays. The playa itself was dotted 
with large-scale art di plays, many 
of which came alive after dark for 
the enjoyment of glow stick-deco-

rated participants. 
This was also Eleanor Roosevelt 

College senior Angela Feng's first 
year at Burning 'Man, and she had 
the time of her life. "It's amazing:' she 
said. "Everyone here is open and free. 
You have conversations here that you 
would never have anywhere else." 

That, more than anything else, 
was what made wandering the 
playa after dark most interesting. 
You realize that it' not the things 
that make this experience what it is 
- it's the attitude. The event is so far 
from the real world, both literally 

and figuratively, that just casually 
attending it is out of the question. 
The cost of it all, combined with 
the fact that there is no existing 
structure and that everything (food, 
furniture, transportation, shelter) 
must be carried into and away from 
the event, means that only people 
who are truly committed to the ide-
als of Burning Man actually attend. 
Black Rock City is a living com-
munity every year, albeit temporar-
ily, because its citizens make it so. 
They volunteer, they beautify and 
they help those around them. If you 

are open enough and extroverted 
enough, they'll welcome you in, no 
questions asked. 

And at the end of the week, when 
the man finally burns with all due 
ceremony (and a quite impressive 
firework display), you sit there and 
watch not as a lonely face in the 
center of the crowd, but as a part of 
:!hat community. 

And it was there that you final -
ly understand the rest of what the 
greeters told you upon entering: 

Thi.s is Black Rock City, welcome 
home. J

. Cross Country Comes Home 
to Host Annual Triton Classic 
• RUNNERS, from page 26 
in a field of 52 teams and 509 run· 
ners, with freshman Jesse Morrill 
leading the team in 48th place and 
s<?phomore Jake LeVieux in 50th 
place. Junior Greg Geldman, senior 
team captain Daniel Halligan and 
sophomore Gabe LaMonthe finished 
the race in 82nd, 126th and 136th 
place, respectively. 

"We lost a few key seniors last 
year who we will defmitely miss 
this year, but we have some great 
young guys who are ready to fill 
those shoes," Holligan said. " I have 
high expectations for those guys this 
year." 

successfully replace last year's CCAA 
runner of the year and three addi-
tional top runners? The women's 
team members must find answers 
to these questions if they plan to 
accomplish something they could 
not do last season: unseat Chico 
State in the West Regional at Chico. 

But until then, UCSD will look 
for answers at home as it hosts the 
Annual Triton Classic (Oct. 7) and 
the CCAA championship (Oct. 21).

The annual Sophomore Distance Runner Triton Classic is 

on a course that is similar to the one

said. 

Koche agreed, crediting tlhe Triton Tide for 
the intensified play. 

"[The fans J really get us flTed up and make 
playing much more exciting,ft Koche said. 

In game one, UCSD took a 6-3 lead after 
Koche recorded back-to-back blocks. The ladies 
got on a roll after freshman middle blocker Sylvia 
Schmidt scored a big kill to put the Tritons on top 
by two, 8-6. After a 12-3 
scoring run by the home 

next play and to get on the ball again." 
The Tritons used the favorable call, run-

ning to a 22-13 lead and finishing with a 30-J 7 
win. 

The ladies also controlled game three, 
building an early 11 -2 advantage. 

"We've really been working on our service 
and return games and we're trying to create 
the runs," Black said. "It just happened at the 
beginning of the game against JDominguez 

Hillsl ." 
The Tritons were forced

to call a timeout after the 
Toros went on a 5-1 run that 
brought the score to 28-23. 
Sophomore middle blocker 
Hannah Gary emphatically 
put away the fmal point, giv-
ing UCSD its second con-
secutive victory. 

Cou rtney thought otlh-
erwise, digging a tough hit 
and then putting away tlhe 
kill for an 18-11 advantage. 
The game ended on a Toro 
hitting error, giving UCSD 
the 30- J 8 win . 

UCSD jumped out to a 
quick 5-0 lead in game two. 

Ries and Courtney each 
_ Brianna Koche, scored 10 kills while Koche 

Senior Middle Blocker added five blocks and six 
kills to the effort. Sophomore 
outside hitt'!r Casey Wilson 

tallied four aces for the match . After a double block by Koche and Bailey, the 
Tritons built an 8-1 advantage and pushed it to 
10-1 on a Koche kill. 

Some controversy arose after the Toros cel-
ebrated a kill that they thought brought them 
within four, but the referee called a back-row 
attack and awarded UCSD the point, giving 
the Tritons a 12 -6 lead. 

Koche said that the Tritons' poise helped 
them take command of the game. 

The Tritons now have a week off for the 
first time all season. 

"It's really nice to have the week off because 
it gives us time to work on the th.ings that we 
really need to perfect before our next match; 
Bailey said. 

UCSD returns to action Sept. 29 to take on 
Sonoma State at 7 p.m. in RIMAe Arena. 

"Every team in our league is great and 
"We were really focused and in our ele-

ment.ft she said. "We were just ready for the 
we need to prepare for a lough opponent in ARASH KESHMIRIANIGU,oIRDIAN

• SOCCER, from page 28 

"[CampbellJ took a second touch 
and then shot the ball from about 
30 yards out, just Sinking it beneath 
the post above the keeper's reach, ft 
Malley said. "Relief set in and I 
really thought we were going to win 
the game after that , like our lifeline 
had been given to us ." 

Campbell's shot sent the game 
into overtime, but the Tritons failed 
to capitalize in on the brillance of 
the 90th minute. 

' We definitely stepped up our 
level of play in overtime," McGovern 
said. "We connected brilliant passes, 
won more balls in the air, and took 
quality shots. Defense was working 
really hard. There were no more 
breakaways, and I stopped a threat 
or two. Basically we dominated, and 
our attitudes were right. We were 
fighting for the win we all deserved, 
but didn 't get it," 

Though a win was tlhe ideal goal 
of tlhe team, tlhe excitement of the 
game made the tie worthwhile. 

"W ith that close of a game I'll 
accept the tie, but I'm deftnitely not 
satisfied: Malley said. 

The Bakersfield match, along 
with tlheir recent loss to Chico State 
on ·Sept. 17, left the Tritons hungry 
for redemption and a way out of 
their no-win slump. They hoped to 
resume their winning ways in tlheir 
game against Cal State Los Angeles, 
which was set for 3 p,m. Sept. 24. 

Results for the game were not yet 
available by print time. However, 
there was an air of excited anticipa-
tion from the players. 

"Cal State LA is leading tlhe south 
division in points and tlhat needs 
to be us," senior midfielder Kelly 
Cochran said. "It's a difficult field to 
play at - incredibly tiny and bumpy. 
They have always played very physi-
cal and that tends to disrupt us .• 

Nerves were high and botlh teams 
knew a lot was ridillg on tlhis game. 

"Everything is on the line - the 
top spot in the soutlh division, the 
chance to break the record we have 
for losing at their field every time 
we've played there, tlhe opportunity 
to maintain our chances at going 
to CCAA playoffs and to rqiolll1s,

26 SPORTS THE UCSD CUAItDIAN . MONIMY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2006 

Fifth-Ranked Tritons Don't Disappoint in Front of 1,589 Faithful Fans 
~ WAltR POLO, from page 28 

"We were really pleased with 
the defense for the most part, but 
on offense, we've missed too many 
shots; Harper said. "The good news 
is, we beat our rivals and we didn't 
really play well at all." 

Wi thin the first couple min-
utes of the match, the Lions took 
the lead, with senior Shaun Flood 
notching his first of three goals of 
the night. UCSD went right back at 
them to tie it up, with junior driver 
Adnan /erkovic striking on the very 
next possession. 

The Tritons continued to attack 
the Lions' defense, but they were 
unable to capitalize on good shots, 
hitting the post three possessions in 
a row. 

cards for arguing. 
Jerkovic, who led the Tritons with 

thTff goals in the match, got UCSD 
on the board again on a play set up 
during a timeout. After trading goals, 
Loyola Marymount University called 
a timeout with only 2:09 left in the 
game. 

While the game seemed like it 
was over, the Lions stormed back to 
put up rwo points within a minute. 
The Tritons failed to get an insurance 
goal, but senior goalkeeper Jeremy 
Randall made a great save at the end 
of the game to secure the victory. 

Junior driver Nestor Dordoni 
played a crucial role in the Tritons' 
success, winning all of the sprints 
to begin the quarter. His swiftness 

allowed UCSD to 

ire bigger, wire

going to work harder

control posses-
sion, according to 
Casellini. 

" Dordoni 
helped out so 
much by winning 
every single sprint, 
because momen-
tum is a big part 
of water polo; 
Casellini said. 

- Ty Lackey, UCSD only 

UCSD was 
the first to find 
the back of the 
net in the sec-
ond quarter. 
With 2 min-
utes, 24 sec-
onds remain -
ing, Loyola tied 
it up at two, 
only to have the 
Tritons counter 
with Casellini's 
goal seconds 
later. 

Senior Two-Meter looks to improve 
from here, with 

more experience and hard work. 
The Lions tied it up once again in 

the third quarter when the goalkeeper 
threw a long pass for a fast break goal. 
Sophomore driver Julien Lorman!" 
scored a goal to give Loyola the lead, 
but 'it only took UCSD 20 seconds to 
tie the game, 4-4. With some crucial 
stops and second-chance opportuni-
ties, the Tritons went up by two goals 
by the end of the third. , 

"It came down to a few key plays 
that they made; Lions head coach 
John Loughran said after the game. 
"They got some big stops when they 
needed it." 

"This squad is far from reaching 
its potential;' Harper said. "There are 
a lot of new guys and a lot of people 
are sorting themselves out." 

UCSD and Loyola are considered 
to be two of the top teams on the 
WWPA, making a playoff matchup 
all but inevitable. When asked about 
the possibility of facing the Lions in 
the WWPA championship this year, 
senior two-meter Ty Lackey said, 
"We're bigger, we're stronger, and 
we're going to work harder than they 
are, so we're going to win:' 

The pace and intensity picked up 
in the fourth quarter, even among 
coaches, who both received yellow

NCAA championships for the second

sea on with a seventh-place finish at 
the NCAA West Regional. The men's 
and women's teams put some of those 
doubts to rest in Falcon Heights when 
they raced all of their top runners for 
the first time this season. 

The fifth -ranked women's team 
performed particularly well at the 
high-powered Roy Griak race, fini h-

ing fourth out of 29 teams in the 5k

that was expected to be difficult 
becau e of the turns, rolling hills and 
grass. 

"We are looking forward to the 
rest of this season and it looks to be 
one of Our best seasons yet:' junior 
team captain Diane Dunn said. "We 
lost a number of seniors to gradu-

looking very strong." 

Dunn led the Tritons with her 

ninth-place finish out of 278 com-

Dunn was the first UCSD runner

UCSD Edges Lions in Thriller· Fresh Team Runs With 
Promise 

Men's and women's 
cross country show 
strength in St. Paul, 
placing 13th and 
fourth, respectively. 

By Eric Grimwade 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

Last Saturday's impressive show-
ing by the UCSD cross country 
team at the prestigious Roy Griak 
Invitational in Falcon Heights, Mrnn. 
is a telltale sign that the Tritons are 
beginning to reaffirm themselves as 
one of the premier squads in the 
nation under longtime head coach 
Ted Van Arsdale. 

"We are very happy with the prog-
ress that the team has made this year," 
assistant coach Nate Garcia said. "We 
have a younger team than last year, 
but both teams have really shown 
a good amount of maturity and are 
deveroping a great team character."

The Tritons rush their LMU opponent os he searchesfor an open man dangerously close to the home net, but the Lions could not secure the win andfell to the Tritons 7-8 on Sept. 22. 

The UCSD women's team, coming 
off of its best season ever in Division 
II with a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association chaJllpionship and a sev-
enth-place finish at the NCAA cross 
country championships, recently 
graduated three of its top seven run-
ners, including former All-American 
team captain Mimi Hodgins. Doubts 
soon arose over whether a younger 
team could match last year's success.

The crowd of 1,589 was electric 
with anticipation in the Canyonview 
Pool Complex and the fifth-ranked 
UCSD men's water polo team did 
not disappoint. 

In their first home game since 
the start of fall quarter, the Tritons 

shook off initial nerves and settled 
down to beat their Western Water 
Polo Association rival, sixth-ranked 
Loyola Marymount University, 8-7 .

tribute to the pregame jitters. but

Women's Soccer Forces 
Draw in Waning Mi~utes 

By Nicky Buchanan 
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 

The heart -stopping rhythm of 
Friday's away game demonstrates 
the fighting spirit of the 11th-ranked 
UCSD women's soccer team as it 
battled to the very end with Cal State 
Bakersfield, scoring with only 24 sec-
onds left on the clock to force a 2-2 
draw. 

The game got off to an early and 
favorable start as UCSD junior mid-
fielder Ali Lai earned her team the 
first goal just 12 minutes into the 
game. 

"Amanda Esquivel sent an amaz-
ing ball over the top of the defense:' 
Lai said. "\ ran onto it. I was one-on-
one with the keeper and we were both 
sprinting toward the baH, but \ got to 
it first and chipped it over her on my 
first touch and scored ." 

The Tritons couldn't hold on to 
thei r glory for long. as Bakersfield 
bounced back with a goal before the 
half to tie. 

Sophomore goalkeeper Jessica 
McGovern was devastated by the 
play, and described the score from a 
goalie viewpoint. 

"The ball was crossed into the 
penalty box and there was a scramble 
in front of me~ she said. "There were 
about five of our players against five of 
theirs. but somehow the girl cleared a 
path for herself and shot from less 
than 10 yards away. I dove low and 
to the right. but the ball skinned the 
bottom of my lower hand. I heard it 
hit the net and my heart completely 
topped for a second. They brought 

it to 1-1:' 
Senior mid fielder Heather Sugg 

kept the ball alive with countless 

headers. 
"She ·did so many I'm surprised 

• she doesn't have permanent brain 
damage!" McGovern said. 

The Tritons also out-shot 
Bakersfield 35 to 18, but the shots 
just weren't being completed and the 
Roadrunners scored yet again after 
halftime for a 2- 1 lead on UCSD. 

"You can have 99 percent pos-
session, but what it comes down to 
is who capitalizes on their chances. 
and that's what this team did:' senior 
forward Alisa Malley said. 

But the Tritons did not let the lead 
interfere with their determination to 
bring the game back to their side. 

"After [Bakersfieldl scored their 
second goal. we responded with 
force," McGovern said. "Everyone 
picked up the intensity. You could 
feel it on the field. Every time the 
ball went out. players were sprinting 
to put it back into playas quickly 
as possible. There was something 
beautiful in the composed urgency." 

That urgency is what fueled the 
Tritons to make their last minutes 
count, and brought them out of 
what appeared to be another lost 
game. 

Malley recalled the pivotal turn-
ing point in the game with vibrancy. 

"We were working the ball 
down the field with a minute to go," 
Malley said. "Heather had given a 
pass to [junior midfielder Chelsey 
CampbeHl. who took a first touch, 
and I was running down the oppo-
site side of the field thinking I just 
needed to get there because she was 
so far out I thought she was going 
to cross it.

match. With the win, the Tritons 
improved their record to 12-2 while 
the Lions dropped to 6-5. 

" \ think everyone came out 
pretty excited. with a little bit of 
nervous energy;' senior utility Jesse 
Casellini said. "Having all these 
people come out means a lot to 
us." 

The defense looked spectacu-

lar for most of the night. but the 
offense was not as solid, as the 
Triton attackers hit the post numer-
ous times throughout the game. 

Head coach Denny Harper 
noted the offense's struggles. but he 
was able to draw optimism out of 
the performance.

Tritons Spear Otters in Battle

CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

The No. 13 UCSD women's vol-
leyball team handled the distraction 
of the first days of classes by scoring 
a tough four-game victory over Cal 
State Monterey Bay 23-30, 32-30, 30-
25 and 30-27 on Sept 22 in Seaside, 
Calif. 

"[Starting school] is definitely a' 
transition:' sophomore outside hitter 
Rebecca Bailey said. "Were anxious 
to start because we want to meet new 
people but more importantly, the fans 

_ don't come until classes begin." 
Cal State Monterey Bay broke 

UCSD's season-long streak of only 
playing three-game matches. The 
Tritons had either swept or have 
been swept in 2006 up until Friday 
night's match against the Otters. It 
was the longest streak in school his-
tory, beating the 1994 team's eight-
game streak. 

Senior co-captain Nicole Courtney 
led the team with 15 kills, while junior 
opposite Amber Ries added 14 of her 
own. Bailey and senior co-captain 
Brianna Koche gave UCSD 11 more 
each. Junior defensive specialist and 
libero Natalie Facchini dug up 21 hits 
in the match. 

The team improved to 11-
2 O\-erall and 6-2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association with 
the triumph. 

The Tritons returned after two 
away games Sept. 20 and didn't dis-
appoint the fairly 1arge home crowd 
by quickly disposing of Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 30-18, 30-17. 30-24 
at RIMAC Arena. 

-It was really fun to haft the stu-
dents and the crowd again; Black
