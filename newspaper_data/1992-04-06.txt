Closing of a Cam ............ 
May Be Inevitable 
By Eric Schmidt 
Associate News Editor 

The Univers ity of Californ ia 
Board of Regent~ may be forced to 
shut down a UC campu~ if the bud-
get crisis worsens, UC Student As-
sociation (UCSA) leaders said last 
week. 

The state legislature is currently 
considering a budget which would 
cut UC funding an additional 18 
percent ($345 million), equivalent 
to the enti re state budget for two 
campuses. 

"Unless the govemor makes an 
affirmative, immediate effon to help 
[offset the budget cri i ], it is ex-
tremely likely that campuses will 
close," said UCSA Executive Di-
rector Lee Butterfield. 

However, sources inside the UC 
Office of the President deny that 
any such closures will take place. 001 
cenainly have not heard that," said 
A si tant Vice President ofUniver-
sity Relations Ed Crawford. '" have 
not seen anyone talking about clos-
ing a campus." 

According to UCSA Vice Presi-
dent John Edson, UC Santa Cruz 

will be the mo t likely target in the 
event of a severe budget shortfa ll ,

Butte rfi eld said students o f 
cl sed campuses would be redis-
tributed to other campuses selected 
by the UC administration . 

"UCLA and UC Berkeley won ' t 
clo e -they are the nagship cam-
puses," Butterfield said. 

In addition, Butterfield a5serted 
that high-level administrators' per-
sonal ties with certain campuses 
will preserve them. 

Board of Regents Chair Meredith 
Khachigian is from Santa Barbara,

of that campus, he aid.

Co-ops Continue Search for Infonnal Resolution 
By Dan Krauss 
Staff Writer 

In hopes that they can .. Iiminate 
the need to litigate in court, the 
UCSD student cooperatives are 
pursuing university procedures as a 
way to resolve the co-op cri is. 

According to Lottie Cohen, le-
gal defense for the co-ops, the co-
ops are pursuing an infonnal meet-
ing with Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, formal grievances against 
the administration within the uni-
versity system and Iitigalion out-

ide the university, all concerning 
the General Store Co-op break-in 
and related issue . 

"There are no new 
proposals" Cohen 
said. The universi ty-
level grievance hear-
ings and the litigation 
on the temporary re-
straining order are on-
going, she added. 

Having found a 
meeting with Vice CancellorofUn-
dergraduare Affairs Joseph Warson 

to be unsatisfactory, the co-ops re-
quested a formal university hearing 

on the grievances two 
week · ago. 

The ten-day time 
limit during which the 
administration is re-
quired to respond to 
the grievances expires 
today. 

Cohen said that 
he will amend the 

grievances before the hearing, at 
which point she will disclose more 

details about their contents. 
"The grievances are an adminis-

trative remedy," aid Cohen. '" f the 
resolution i n 't satisfactory, either 
side may petition for a writ of man-
date, which is a review by the supe-
rior coun of the correctne s of the 
underlying administrat ive proceed-
ing. ' 

Jeff Corlett, manager of the 
General Store, described the hear-
ing as a "mini-coun, except the ad-
mini trators sit in tead of a j udge."

Fratemity leaders said the songbooKs are few in number 

and were meant only as a joke. 
"If these kinds of songs are prevalent through the 

syslem: [the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic 
Council] need to clean up their act," said Allen Yarnell, 
who led lhe UCLA investigation. 

Campus feminists said the univer.;ity has missed the 
point by concenlrating only on Phi Kappa Psi' s songbook. 

"The administration isn't taking us seriously," said 
Sheila Moreland, co-editorof TORelher. '''This is not just an 
isolaled incident," 

"'Ibis is a problem which pervades society but i~ 
especially perpetuated in the Greek system and needs to be 
addressed," she added. 

But some members of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity contin-
ued to defend their songs. 

" I don't think they promote abuse against women at 
all," said Manny Lopez, a Phi Kappa Psi representative. 
"'ne problem i that people don 'I understand the spirit in 
which they ' re ung." 

He added, "The songs are only sung within the physical 
structure of Phi Psi."

UCSB Chancellor Suggests DMdlng 
College of Letters and ScIences 

A new propo aI would diVide UC Santa Barbam's 
College of Letlers and Science into three separate areas to 
increase admini strative efficiency. but concerns have been 
raised by some who say Ihe plan could backfire. 

UCSB Chancellor Barbara Uehling recently announced 
a plan to split the university 's largest college into three 
small er div isions: humanities and fine ans: mathematics 
and physical sc iences; and social sciences. 

The division would strengthen administratl ve attention 
10 each of the three areas, UehllOg said. 

Under the current system, one provost and tluee asso-
ciate deans oversee the entire college. 

History Department Chair Sears McGee is concerned 
that restructuring could mean some faculty members in hi 
department would worlc for the humanities diviSion while 
others would work under social sciences. 

"We have three chairs under the History Department," 
McGee said. "They are all historians, but two have ended 
up directing interdiSCiplinary programs," he said, adding 
that the department faculty had originally voted against the 
proposal. 

The proposal.may beimplementedasearly as next year.

Charges Against Weir Dropped 
• Srudent arrested for taping argument between parking 
officer and graduate student; he may fIle a grievance 
By PhIlip Michaels 
Senior Staff Wnter 

The San Diego city anomey's 
office will not be pressing charges 
against Michael Weir, a UCSD stu-
dent arrested last quarter for inter-
fering with a police~officer. 

ThecasewasdismissedatWeir's 
arraignment on Mar. 25. 

"I'm pretty pleased. I knew it 
was going to happen," Weir said. 

Wei r added that he intends to file 
a non-academic grievance against 
the UCSD Police. 

According to Steve Schroeder, 

co-ops 

Weir's attomey, the dismissal of the 
case was inevitable. 

"I don't read into the thoughlS of 
the city anomey's office, but I think 
they knew they had a bad case," said 
Schroeder. 

"Michael Weir was unjustly at-
tacked, and they realized they made 
a mistake," he added . 

The city attorney's office could 
not be reached for comment. 

Weir was arrested on Feb. 5 by a 
UCSD police officer as he was vid-
eotaping an argument between a 
parking enforcement officer and 

Dietmar Walther, a Visual Arts 
graduate student. 

Police claimed that Weir, a War-
ren College Visual Arts major, was 
interfering withanofficerin lheline 
of duty and arrested him for violat-
ing California Penal Code 148, a 
misdemeanor. 

Although police denied that the 
arrest had anything to do with the 
video camera, Weirbelievedthat he 
was arre ted because the police of-
ficer objected to being videolUped. 

Weir' arre t causedanuproarin 
the Visual Arts Department among 
faculty and students who believed 
that the police' actions were unjus-
tified .

Cohen hopes that the conflict 
won ' t go that far. 

" It is the continuing, sincere hope 
of both the cooperatives and myself 
that this maner could be resolved 
informally with the administration 
and its general counsel. I have for-
mally requested an all-hands-on 
meeting with the chancellor to ef-
fectuate thiS," she said. 

Although Cohen requested the 
meeting over a month ago, she still 
has not received a response from 
Atkinson. 

"Time marches on and we have 
to pursue formal remedies," she said. 
However, Cohen emphasized that 
she is still very hopeful that she will 
be able to meet with the chancellor. 

AtklOson was not available for 
comment. 

According to Cohen, the co-ops 
are also continuing injuctive litiga-
tion outsideofthe university. Cohen 
described the three stages of injunc-
tive litigation as: first , gaining a 
temporary restraining order, which 
the students were granted 10 Janu-
ary; second, getting a preliminary 
injunction, to which the administra-
tion yielded, thereby eliminating the 
need for litigation in court; and third, 
making the temporary restraining 
order permanent. 

"Eventually the(e will be a trial 
concerning the preliminary injunc-
tion and damage!;," Cohen said. 

According to Corbett, the s low 
pace of administrative and legal pro-
ceedings has not dampened student 
suppon for the co-ops. "We haven't 
lost support: there'sjust not as much 
active suppon," he said. "When the 
time comes, the students will be 
there." 

Although Corbett admits that 
donations for legal defense for the 
General Store Co-op have decreased 
since the wave of co-op support 
rallies following the break-in, he 
said he still feels that there are stu-
dents who want to contribute. 

"A lot of people still come in and 
ask, 'What's going on? What can I 
do?,' .. Corbett said. "But it's hard 
for people to give money when they 
don't know what's going on." 

Cohen shared Corbett's senti-
ment. "There remains support and 
activism on the part of the students," 
she said.

Football, You Bet 

T illS YEAR, A GROUPOr- UCSD snJDENTS will attempt once again to start a foot-ball team at UCSD. This proposal 
has been voted on twice before, in 1987 and 
1988. 

In 1987, the referendum proposed a 
$6.50 per quarter fee increase specifically 
to fund the football team. It passed but 
could not be put into effect because not 
enough students voted. 

In 1988, the referendum was revised 
with a proposed student fee increase of 
$15.00 per quarter, $10.00 of which would 
go toward a football team. the other five of 
which would aid all other intercollegiate 
sports at UCSD. Sixty percent of students 
voted in favor of the referendum, just nine 
percent hort of the number needed for it to 
pass. 

Chris Rys, the student who wrote the 
football referendum in 1988, felt that it did 
not pass because not enough students 
understood that the money would help all 
sports at UCSD. 

Again this year, the referendum pro-
poses a fee increase of $15.00 per quarter, 
going toward both a football team and all 
other ~port . 

A CCORDtNG TO TIlE rules of Division m, to which UCSD belongs, scholarships 
cannot be awarded, which calms some fears 
that UCSD' academic standards might be 
lowered with the introduction of a football 
tearn. 

Even if the school changed to Division 
11. a has been proposed for all sports. 
UCSD still might not offer any athletic 
scholarships. 

UCSD would benefit from having a 
football team in that it would unify the 
entire school and generate school spirit, 
both fo r UCSD as a whole and for other 
athletic events. 

A a social benefit, a football team 
would help keep students on campus during 
the weekends. 

As for the concern that a football team 
would di rupt UCSD's academic standards, 
there are sever oil examples of universities 
that have maintained excellent football 
teams as well as excellent academic 
reputations. including the ivy league 
schools, Stanford, UCLA, and UC Berke-
ley. 

W ITHtN A FEW years, a football team would prove to be very financially 
rewarding. College football television 
contracts and exposure ("This is Don 
Criqui with Bob Trumpy at the Orange 
Bowl where a national championship will 
be decided tonight between the No. 2-
ranked UCSD Tritons and the fop-ranked 
Hurricanes o/the Miami . Good evening 
everyone . . . ") are worth millions. But that's 
Division r, and a whole 'nother story. Still, 
a fraction of that pie could be plit among 
low-revenue ports, such as swimming, 
fencing , water polo and crew, which would 
be a boon for everyone.

Sports Edition 
The UCSD athletic department 
now faces two options: one -
expand its sports programs with 
the introduction of football; and 
two - increase competitive 
opportunities with a move to 
Division II. The fonnidable 
opponent facing both of these 
proposals is money. So far, a 
referendum for a student fee 
increase to fund a football team is 
o for 2 in student support at the 
ballot box.

Committee favorably 
reviews possible division 
change but cites lack of 
funding as obstacle 
By Simone MOler 
Contributing Writer 

111e Intercollegiate and Recreational Ath-
letics Advisory Comminee (IRAAq recently 
prepared a repon for Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson which reviewed UCSD's current 
NCAA divisional affiliation and assessed the 
at!tletic department's possible move to Divi-
sion n. In recent years,theviabilityofUCSD's 
current standing in Division III has been ques-
tioned. It has been difficult for UCSD to 
maintainan affiliation in this division as many 
of the small private colleges that dominate 
this division are unwilling to schedule athletic 
competitions against a public university at 
least eight times their size. 

In a letter addressed to IRAAC in lateJuly 
1990, UCSD Athletic Director Judith Sweet 
emphasized the fact that Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletics Conference (SClAC) 

members "have consciou Iy excluded UCSD 
from their schedules to enhance their own 
postseason opportunities and diminish those 
for UCSD." While present rules do not re-
quire a cenain enrollment cap for member-
ship in Division Ill, the possibility of restrict-
ing this division to sma/I institutions only has 
been discussed nationally. UCSD is gradually 
becoming the largest university in the field as 
its enrollment reaches its projected popula-
tion of 25,000. 

Yet UCSD' s size is not the only factor that 
contributes to the regular-season scheduling 
problems. With the scarcity of Division m 
members in California - there are only 13 
teams west of Nebraska in the division -
many UCSD teams cannot comply with 
NCAA rules that require that a certain per-
centage of Division m opponents be sched-
uled. Because UCSD is not a conference 
member, postseason oppol1unities are depen-
dent on subjective evaluations of national 
selection committees, which many times feel 
that Division m should be restricted to small 
institutions. 

In addition to these scheduling difficulties, 
IRAAC describes UCSD as a "mismatch" 
with the institutional profile of most Division 
m school . UCSD is one of the very few 

MOVE TO DIVISION II 
• A move to Division 11 would cost 
UCSD $2,279,100 more than it is al-
ready paying. According to IRAAC, an 
increase in student fees is unlikely as 
is diverting funding from present aca-
demic programs. The source of funding 
has yet to be determined. The follOWing

penses incurred in thousands of dollars.

Mission Bay in Warm Water 
• Off -campus recreation 
center serves student and 
faculty needs 
By ErIn Poole 
Contributing Writer 

With spring here, it's hard to 
ignore the unny outdoors, and the 
Mission Bay Aquatic Center 
provides a great excuse for 
restless students to take a break 
from their studie . 

Located in Mission Bay Park 
off Santa Claro Street, the center 
is recognized as the world 's 
largest in tructional waterfront 
facility . TIle Center was e tab-
lished in 197 1, and is a coopera-
tive collegiate facility designed for 
use by students, faculty, staff and 
alumni of all San Diego County 
universitie and youth organiza-
tions. The facility is funded by 
student fees from both UCSD and 
SDSU. 

The center offers a variety of 
lessons in aquatic sports and 
provides low-cost rentals for 
students. ]n 1991, approximately 
5,000 UCSD students received 
in truction and used the center for 
recreational purposes. The runge 
of sports offered at MBAC 
includes water skiing, ailing, 
surfing, rowing, kayaking, scuba 
diving and windsurfing. 

According to the center's 
director, Glen Bmndenburg, the 
most popular sports currently are 
sailing and water skiing. He adds

that the "fastest growing" sport is 
paddling, a tenn u ed to describe 
different boat styles: the sea 
kayak, the whitewater kayak, the 
canoe and waveskis, 

UCSD crew team members are 
some of the students who have 
had an opportunity to use the 
equipment at MBAC. 

"I don't think enough people 
take advantage of it. There's a lot 
offered. I taught rowing there last 
year and the classes are small ," 
says Robert Meacham, a Warren 
College senior who has been on 
the men's crew team for four 
years. He adds that the rental fees 
and instruc[ional prices are 
reasonable. with student price 
less than those for the general 
public. 

Judy Sand weiss, a Muir 
College junior, is a member of the 
women's crew team and also took 
a surfing class at the center. 

"After looking at other boat 
houses I can really see the 
difference; it's more complete, it 
has more equipment, it's well kept 
and it's a beautiful area to be in," 
she says. 

Other features of the center 
include two classroom, locker 
rooms, a dock and a rowing 
center. 

Surroun~ing the facility are 
beaches and grassy areas complete 
with picnic tables, fire rings, 
swimming areas, tennis and 
basketball courts, a playing field, 
a boat-launching rump and plenty 

of parking ... something students 
can appreciate. 

Student organizations and 
campus group are eligible for 
setting up special recreational and 
instructional events or parties at 
low cost. The center provide 
barbecues, a sound system and 
meeting room . Aquatic events 
offered include unset ail boat 
cruises and water-skiing. 

" It's enjoyable in the sun and 
at the same time you're exercis-
ing," Brandenburg says. 

He also says that classes at the 
center are all taught by students. 
There are cun-ently 80 to 100 purt-
time student employees al the 
center, who instruct or do clerical 
and janitorial work. 

UCSD tudent interested in 
researching fUllher what the 
center has to offer can pick up a 
free copy of the MBAC brochure 
complete with spring schedule at 
Canyonview Recreation Center or 
student information on campus. 
Campus recreation offers classes 
through the MBAC on a quarterly 
basis. Descriptions of these 
classes are found in the 
Canyonview Magazine, which is 
also di tributed free of charge on 
campus. 

Brandenburg offers advice for 
first-time users of the center: " I 
think people have concerns about 
being a beginner. For the instruc-
tor, that 's what they enjoy doing, 
instructing beginners. We like to 
dispel that fear."

6SPBCTACLE 

DIVISION 
ContInued from ...... 
achieved national recognition aca-
demically, UCSD should not be ~ 
luctant to strive for similar excel-
lence within its athletics program." 

The solution to these problems 
of scheduling and incompatibility 
would seem to be solved by a move 
to Division n. The proposed move 
would lead to competitions with 
institutions similar in location, size, 
public affiliation and institutional 
profile. and to the development of 
"healthy rivalries," The UCSD ath-
letic department feels that, "pursu-
ing membership with the California 
Collegiate Athletic Conference 
(CIAA) appears to be the most vi-
able option for UCSD athletics." 

Yet this move would also call for 
additional spending. The total bud-
get for coaches' salaries is expected 
to increase by $745,<XX>, with team 
budgets to increase by $295,600. 
The hiring of a support staff would 
add another $200,000 to the pr0-
jected costs. The recruitment bud-
get would jump from S6,OOO to 
$69,000 and the projected expense 
for scholarships is $600,000. All 
these projected new costs along with 
coaches' benefits and miscellaneous 
costs would add up to $2.279,100 
more than UCSD pays for its Divi-
sion m program. 

IRAAC says it "feels strongly 
that increase of student fees should 
not be required. Funhermore, mon-
ies should not be diverted from aca-
demic programs," This leaves the 

The UCSD Guardiao 

comminee in a quandary as to where 
the additional money will corne 
from, and with the cUlTent fee hikes 
and budget woes in the state of 
Califomia, the need for greater fund-
ing and the source of !his funding is 
sure to be a hot debate.

Its concern is that the quality of 
academics may be sacrificed if 

Monday, Ajnil6, 1992 
UCSD begins toaward grants solely 
based on adlletic ability. The com-
mittee, however, emphasizes.that it 
would only award athletic scholar-
ships to academically qualified tu-
dents and every effort would be 
made to ensure that the "academic 
mission of the uni versity should re-
main of paramount importance." 

The number of pros seems to 
outweigh the cons in a move to 
Division ij.lt would lead to greater 
competitiveopponWlities forUCSD

in Southern Califomia would greatly 
improve scheduling possibilities.

be examined beforeUCSD canjump 
into that arena.

Alanning Experience 

A fire alarm in the Muir College Tenaya Residence Hall forced residents out into the Muir Quad . These 
two students made certain to rescue their most prized possessions before leaving their rooms. 

PELTASON 
Continued from page 1 
Khachigian. the chair of the Board 
of Regents. 

"His international stature, his in-
tegrity, his credibility are all quali -
ties that Jack Peltason will bring to 
the position of president. We dis-
covered a deep respect for him 
among colleagues. with the facuIty 
and students, and with all who have 
worked with him over the years," 
Khachigian said. 

PeItason will encounter a UC 
system experiencing trying finan-
cial times because of the troubled 
California state budget, resulting in 
massive student fee increases and 
budget cut systemwide. Remedie 
as drastic as privatizing the more 
established campu es such as UC 
Berkeley and UCLA ormothballing 
smaller campuses such as UC Riv-
erside and UC Santa Cruz are ru-
mored to have been suggested. 

After being approved for the 
$243,500-a-year position, Peltason 
said, HI am greatly honored 10 be 
asked to assume this responsibility 
for the University o~ California, an 
insti tution to which I am completely 
dedicated. And I have the good 
fOI1une to assume it from David P. 
Gardner. who has left the university 
in a strong position to face the de-
mands of the decade ahead." 

Gardner, currently over eas on 
business. issued a statement prais-
ingPeltason. "His intelligence, skill, 
experience and integrity, and his 
commitment to the University of 
California and the noble purposes it 
serves, will all be needed as the 
university confronts its future and 
seeks to sustain its position as one of 

the greatest centers of learning in 
the world," he wrote. 

Atkinson also issued a statement 
voicing his full upport for Peltason, 
stating, "The regents have made an 
excellent choice. Jack is a distin-
guished leader in higher education, 
a respected scholar, an adept admin-

" We discovered a cfeep 
respect for him among 
colleagues, with the 
faculty and students 
and with all who have 
worked with him over 

the years. 

" MEREDITH KHACHIGIAN 
Board of Regents Chair 

istrator and a very warm human 
being .... [ look forward to working 
with him to address California's 
critical educational needs," he wrote. 

Based on his history at UCI, 
Peltason will provide the opportu-
nity for students to be considered in 
systemwide decisions, according to 

University of California Student As-
sociation (UCSA) Vice President 
John Edson. 

"We'lI ask for [the same t com-
mitment to continue contacts wi th 
students as Gardner [had] ," he said, 
pointing to retention and affimla-
tive action as "key student prob-
lems" that the UCSA would like 
Peltason to address. 

Presi lent of the Associated Stu-
dents of uel Jose Solorio pmised 
Peltason for pursuing student input. 
noting that Peltason VOluntarily 
placed student representatives on a 
campus budget committee and 
implemented a fee-funded facility 
policy which Solorio called one of 
the best in the UC system. 

.. As president of the student body 
th is year, the chancellor has yet to 
let me down," Solorio l'aid. 

Peltason. a Missouri native, re-
ceived his undergraduate degree 
from the Universi ty of Missouri in 
1943 and was awarded a Ph.D. in 
political science from Princeton Uni-
versity in 1947. Peltason hasexten-
sive administrative experience at 
both the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign and UCI. and 
has also taught at Smith College, 
Princeton and the Univer~ityofMis­
souri . 

He served as president of the 
American Council on Education for 
seven year~, where he represented 
the viewpoint of colleges and uni -
versitie in the making of national 
policies and laws. He has also held 
other posts, including vice presi-
dent of the American Political Sci-
ence Association and ex-officio 
member of the Executive Commit-
tee of the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences.

CLOSURE 
Continued from page 1 
campus unlikely. according to 
Butterlield's analysis. 

Butterfield did say, though, that 
the Board of Regents probably will 
take steps to preventthe closure of a 
campus. "Most of us can't imagine 
a future of California where cam-
puses are being shut down for lack 
of money," he said. 

In addition to the closure of a 
campus, additional fees could be 
: harged to professional school stu-
dents. state residency requirements 
could be prolonged and higher fees 
may be imposed on s tudents seek-
ing a second degree, Edson said. 

Butterfield said the UCSA is 
sponsoring an initiative which would 
close billions of dollars in tax loop-
holes to wealthy corporations. Th~ 
proceeds could help offset the bud-
get crisis. 

Edson said such loopholes as tax 
deductions for country club mem-
berships and deduction currently 
enjoyed by oil companies would be 
included. 

Theinitiative, Edson said, would 
raise $585 million forprogram such 
as the UC which are not protected in 
the state budget. A petition 10 send 
the bill to the voters is currently 
being di tributect around UC cam-
puses statewide. 

"TIle problem is, the legislators 
and voters want two contrJdictory 
things. They don't wanttaxes mised 
and they don' t want ' ervices cut," 
Butterfield ' aid. 

UCSA leaders complained that 
the initiative has not been given 
much attention by the Board of Re-
gents. However, Crawford argued 
that the regents are on I y responsi ble 
for the intemal UC budget. 

"We don't really get involved in 
telling the legislature where to tax ," 
Crawford said. 

Edson said the closing of a cam-
pus is unlikely, since Govemor 
Wilson would not want to be em-
barrassed by having to dl band the 
UCsy tem. 

" It's unlikely that the govemor is 
going to put himself on the line -
he has future political aspirations ," 
he said. 

Edson noted, however, that in 
order to balance the current budget 
under consideration by the state leg-
islature, Wilson would be forced to 
clo eacampus. Theonly wayout of 
the crisis. he added, is fort he gover-
nor to overestimate tate revenues, 
plunging the state deep into debt. 

According to Edson, the major 
problem with the current budget 
crisis is that it seems s tudents will be 
forced to pick up most of the tab, 
either through fee increases or re-
duced enrollment. 

"There is very little incentive to 
cut administrative position ,'. Edson 
said. 

He noted that any other corpora-
tion in times of economic hardship 
would Jay off mid-level manage-
ment. "Bechtel [an engineering cor-
poration I lays off up to 40 percent of 
its mid-level management in hard 
years ," he said . 

Edson suggested that the UC con-
sider asimilar approach to handl ing 
the budget crisis instead of merely 
increasing fees. 

Crawford, though, said the ad-
ministration already is being cut to 
prevent the shuning down of pro-
grams such as professional schools 
and academic departments. 

"Probably in any event we're 
going to have funher admini trative 
cuts," he said. "Such cuts should 
always come before [cuts to] teach-
ing or student service!> ."

yet another error. By the time the 
Tritons had gotten the second out. 
the Toreras had scored four more to 
take a 7-0 lead . They were helped 
considerably by Triton m iscues-a 
passed ball. a wild pitch and two 
errors. 

" W e held them pretty well the 
rest of the game, but one inning will 
make or break you," Jarrel l said. 

Mounger did not retum for the 
founh, a Stutzmnn started the in -
ning. 

The Tritons responded to the 
change, tightening thei rdefenseand 
waking up the stagnam offense in 
their fourth. 

Lisa M om led offlhe inning with 
a walk. Kerri Carter double two 
batters later and then Faith Franke 
brought home Mom with a double. 
M azanet finished out the inning's 
scoring withadoubletoscoreCarter, 

Stutzman was untouchable fo r 
the rest of the game. yielding only 
one more hit and one walk. 

But it was too little too lale for 
the Tritons. They managed to score 
one more in the fifth when Zuniga 
scored on a M om fly ball. UCSD 
had a couple more chances, but 
cou ldn ' t get any thing going. 

w ll-being, and 
much more.

information 
call 534-3874. 

Jarrell was puzzled over her 
team's lack of concentration. " W e' re 
getting used tosplitting these double-
headers," Jarrell said. " We j ust came 
out flat in the second game. W e' re 
better than a lot of the teams we lose 
to. We' re just nor playing to our 
potemiJI. ..

Paced by the hot bat of clean-up 
hiller David Rex, the Triton 
hardballers ( 15-3-1) routed vi iting 
Cal Baptist 16-1 on Thursday. 

Rex hammered out four hit in 
five at-bat, including a double an~ 
a two-run blast. The All-American 
transfer from Cal State San Bernar-
dino also drove home four runs on 
the afternoon. 

Rex continues 10 lead UCSD of-
fensively with a .423 batting aver-
age and five home runs. 

The entire line-up pitched in on 
Thursday, as UCSD left lhe dia-
mond with a sizeable collection of 
19 base hits. 

The 16 runs scored by UCSD 
marked the sixth occasion lhis sea-
son that the Tritons have reached 
double-digits in the runs column. 
Double-digit games account for 40 
percent of the Triton victories. 

Senior starter Brent Hansen bet-
tered his record to 5-0, by allowing 
on ly one unearned run in his five 
inningson the mound. Hansen leads 
theTri tonrotalionwitha 1.79eamed 
run average and 46 strikeouts. 

Though Hansen was throwing 
with authority, Head Coach Lyle 
Yates opted to remove his ace and 
g ive some work to the rest of his 
slaff. Yates fe lt this was necessary 
because last week 'sonly other game 
had been rained out.

Track Breaks Two Records SCORE 
• Six more Tritons qualify for the NCAA 
championships at Saturday's Riverside Invitational 

ContInued from ..... 20 
who thinks the DH i evil because 
it's such an inherent break with 
tradition? By J .. tlne Cocan 

Guardian Reporter 
With the season in full swing. the 

UCSD track and field team already 
has a number of athletes qualified 
fortheNCAAchampion hip. Sat-
urday, at the Riverside Invitational , 
it added ix more to that list, and 
broke two school records in the pro-
ces . 

The Tritons put in a good how-
ing with Scott Sargeant and Paul 
Cogbill, who came in first and fourth 
in the hammer. Both have already 
qualified for NCAAs. 

Other strong performances were 
given by Yvette Marzullo, who ran 
a quick 58.90 400-meter race, and 
Ian Cooke, who jumped 6-8 in the 
high jump. 

UCS D women broke two school 
records at the meet. Denise 
McFayden fini heel third in the 3,00:> 
meters with a time of 9:54.7, im-

p~ her NCAA qualifying time 
and setting a new Triton record. 
Renee Sprowl also set a new record 
in the triple jump. soaring 371/4. 
which landed her a spot in the

ton women beat out their Boston 
University foes for the Whinier 
Cup. All teams eligible for the 
regattas are Divi ion I chool who 
follow a long tradition of competi-
tive rowing. 

Although UCSD's teams have 
Divi ionIDstanding,bolhwomen's 
and men' crew rowed impressively 
thi weekend. 

UCSD women's Head Coach 
Jack Yallerga was quick to say that 
the results of this weekend were 
"encouraging to everyone." e pe-
cially considering the fact that the 
women' team has lost approxi-
mately two week of rowing time 
due to poor weather conditions 
coupled with poorconditions at Mis-
sion Bay. 

Yallegra believes that the most 
memorable regatta of the weekend 
was the women' open novice ei ght 
in which UCSD's team came in 
econd behind USD. 

The women 's team also com-
peted in the varsity, lightweight , 
and collegiate novice events. 

UCSD's lightweight eight was a 
completely novice boat in contrast 
to the majority of the other boats, 
which were primarily mixtures of 

NCAAs. 
Other qual i fiers included second-

place fini shers Ernest Clark in the 
400 meIers, Erica Washington in 
the 200 meIers, and Jeff Hernandez 
in thesleeplechase.Ji\l Lyday joined 
the qualifiers, throwing 134-3 in the 
discus. 

Two Triton relays fini hed third 
al the invitational and qualified as 
well. Thewomen's4xlOOmeterre-
lay leam of Marzullo, Washington, 
Sprowl and Michelle' Mi\ledge ran 
in 49.13 seconds. 

The men's 4x4OO relay learn of 
Clark, Jason Anderson, Gus Hsu, 
and Patrick Foy was equally im-
pressive as it fini shed in 3: 19.6 to 
qualify. 

Other qualifiers who will go to 
the NCAA are Jeff Taylor in the 
hammer, Damian Coleman in the 
triple jump, and Paul Johnson in the 
pole vault. 

Todate, UCSDhas IOmenquali-
fied in nine events, and six women 
q uali fled in eight events, and should 
prove to be a Irong influence at 
NCAAs. 

No. This, from a guy who thinks 
the DH is evil because there should 
be nine players on a side in baseball, 
not ten. (What's next. four trike , 
or bases, or outs?) 

The magic of the World Serie as 
the only time when teams from Ihe 
ALand NLmeet inofficial play i a 
crock. Is lhe Super Bowl hurt by Ihe 
fact that the two teams may have 
played again t eachotherduring the 
regular season? Is a Bull /Warriors 
NBA final hurt by the fact Ihat 
they've faced each other a couple of 
times during the season? No way. 

And the argument for interleague 
play grows even more in stature in 
1993, because of one thing: expan-
sion. With the NL increasing it 
number by two team , the league 
will have to mOve to the AL method 
of scheduling. In other words, Ihe 
Giants and Dodgers will each play 
more games wi th the Phill ies than 
with each other. Ridiculou . 

Wulfs solution is brilliant. A

SPECIAL EDITORIAL SECTION FOR THE A.S. ELECTION S 

PAGE 01 

EDITOR'S NOTE: The endorsements on page 06/07 were decided by a majority vote of the Guardian Editorial Board, comprlsell of 
Editor in Chief Jason Snell, Managing Editor Peter Ko, News Editor Mary Betty Heard and Opinion Editor Ben Boychuk. The Editorial 
Board, along with Associate News Editors Eric Schmidt and Sheryl Wolcott and Associate Opinion Editor Philip Michaels conducted 
interviews with the candidates for all campus-wide posts. Candidates for senator positions were given two questions and asked to 

submit a one-page response. Among the board's criteria were relevant experience, a command of the issues, clearly defined goals, and 
a realistic understanding of the powers and limitations of the positiOns they are seeking. Students spend much of the year complaining 

about problems such as parking and high fees. This is the one time of the year students, if they vote wisely, can actually have an 
effect. A student representative, possessing a clear mandate from the student body can make a difference. We strongly urge students 

to vote. We cannot expect a strong student government when few students take the time to have a voice in that government.

..... DURAN 
S.M.I.LE. 

~? You might ask. is there a 
reason 10 smile with the way things have 
been going here at UCSD? Student fees 
may be going up another 24%, the 
student-run co-ops have little to no real 
autonomy, the administration continues to 
oppress students any way it can, we 
haven't experienced a real TG in a long 
time now ... the list goes on. 

So why smile? Because all of that can 
change. We find ourselves at a crucial 
crossroads at UCSO. The right combina-
tion of events, initiated by a student 
govemment aware of what needs to be 
done, and with the experience and know-
how to catalyze change - we can cause a 
movement to happen. 

That is the focus of and the driving 
force behind S.M.I.LE.: Student 
Movement Initiating Ludership and 
EmpowermenL The Regents and the 
Administration have proven that the 
needs and voices of students will not be 
addressed unless we hold them 
accountable. We as students are not 
powerless. I am committed to providing 
that leadership to unify those resources 
within our student body vital to our 
empowerment. 

I am the candidate with the necessary 
experience to know what it takes to 
effectively serve students, and the vision 
and the courage to follow through with , 
the commitment. 

So S.M.l.LE. on April 7, 8,9. 

Mike HOLMES 
STUDENTS FOR 
PROGRESS 

We need a President and council with 
a real agenda that truly focuses on 
imminent student concems. Our 
leadership cannot be afraid to voice these 
needs to the University. 

I plan to: fight outrageous fee hikes by 
rewri ting fee increase election codes and 
fighting for bills which discourage over-
inflated fees; stop skyrocketing parking 
fees by demanding thai our fees be used 
only for student parking; increase parking 
capabilities by fighting lor permanent 
parking structures; stop growing living 
costs and living restriction threats with 
new on<ampus housing; and give back 
the right 01 AS. and student organizations 
to prognun c~ by ~manding that 
new MFestival Seating" and other policies 
be revoked. We alao need to gain control 
of our fees and facilities by using existing 
1egaI pl'l!5511re to draw up I new contract 
with the University. These rights are 
enjoyed by many other UC students and 
should be extended to our sampus. 

During tht last thret years, I have 
served on the AS. and have proven that 
progressive student change can occur with 
proactive, rather IIwn reactive, problem 
solving. We need Ieadmhip with 
experience and tanple student goals, but 
most importantly. _ need leadership that 
can make tIIo&e goMs a n!aIity.

Presently, students are confronted 

with growing challenges induding fee 
hikes, cuts to quality and eventual 
privatization of the Uc. Student 
Government must be changed, incremen-
tally and fundamentally, to provide more 
effective means for students to address 
these challenges and promote our 
interests. The AS must be better utilized. 

It must be innovated for relevance to 
the student body. The AS must be made 
more partidpatory. 

The fiscal crisis causing these 
challenges has further led to crises for 
student organizations. It has also meant 
cuts to access, excellence and SC!rvices, 
adversely affecting aU groups, and 
particularly impacting people of color. To 
reverse these trends, students and all of 
the University community must be 
activated, unified and involved in 
meaningful co-governance of the 
University. 

I will bring innovation, vision, 
commitment, and coherency to the 
Presidency and student self-governance; I 
will bring fresh pen;pective to the AS-
only an outsider can. Meaningful change -
of the AS and the University - requires 
nothing less. 

if student government is to matter and 
meaningful change to occur, it needs a 
mandate from the student body. Please 
vote in the AS Elections. Please vote for 
those who will work vigorously for 
change, unity and student empowerment. 
We must work together. 

Matthew SCHNURER 
I'm running for President With a 

platform !similar to those of other 
candidates for the Presidency. I concur 
with their goals and issues - sud! as 
preventing undue fee increases, providing 
adequate parking. insuring co-op 
autonomy, seeking cheaper on-campus 
housing. pursuing cultural 
duversity,mandated funding for the WRC, 
preservation of the TG's, and student 
empowerment. These are goals and issues 
I would like to see advanced. 

However, none of this is truly possible 
until the entire system of student sell-
governing is reas5e55ed and reorganized. 
Currently, even the most well intending 
candidate has a slim chance of achieving 
his or her goa Is, as power to make these 
changes is not completely in the hands of 
student government. 

Monetary and space aIIocalion'i and 
thus political power is firmly in the grip of 
the administration who are not willing to 
reJuse this authority. Allocation of 
student resources must rest with the 
student body govemment 

The unseen issue which must be 
~ is the manner in which 
administrators withhold power from 
studenwwhlk~m~y~~g 
to act on their behalf. No student agenda 
will be dfedively addres.d until the 
students are given the pcMeI' to nm their 
own affairs without the IIIIIOiicited 
Influence 01 administraton. 

My experience within the chambers of 
student government has given me the 
opportwIity to ~ the ways in which 
I5sues are manipulated. I have been the 
programmer, I hIVe hem on the insi~, I 
knoW how the machine works. 

I, as President, will refuse to play their 
game. I will not rest until students are 
able to make dtoices for thernlelves. Elect 
a candidate with the drive, motivation, 
and determination to pl'Opft'ly represent 
you. Elect Matthew Schnurer for 
ASUCSD President.

In my two years as an AS Senator, I 
have witnessed many significant 
challenges raised to the student body, 
evident in attacks on student rights and 
control of sell-assessed fees. What the 
campus leadership is faced with is the 
serious responsibility to defend those 
rights with a competent UNmED student 
government. The Associated Student 
Council needs to be strong. effident, 
informed, and professional in meeting the 
challenges at hand. No student leader can 
assert the Undergraduate voice alone. To 
take on these tasks we need to unify the 
colleges and student leadership to deal 
with the problems that face us all. 

My goals are: A UNI.FIED, Informed 
AS Coundl responding to student needs 
and defending student rights. UNITE the 
student leadership of UCSD to develop a 
stronger student voice. Student 
Empowerment Summit bring together 
campus leaders past and present to create 
a definitive plan for the future. Appoint 
highly qualified, responsive and assertive 
students to campuswidl' committees. 
A<:curate information on AS appointments 
to the Student Body through an "AS 
Appointment Cuidebook" and intense 
recruitment. 

I believe I have the experience, 
confidence and drive to bring UNITY to 
the AS and bridge the levels of student 
leadership. Thank you and don't forget to 
make your voices heard. VOTE.

We need an AS Council that is efficient 
and united to accomplish our goals and 
we need a Vice President Administrative 
who will get the job done! As the present 
AS Commissioner of Public Relations, I 
have proven that I am a pro-active student 
leader through establishing the Public 
Relations Charter and Committee and 
creating our new AS newspaper, 
AI.JTIIORIZED PROPACANDA. I will 
not only get the job done, I will excel and 
find creative solutions to problems both 
inside and ouwide of the AS Council. 

Some of the duties 01 the Vice 
President Administrative are chairing the 
AS Council, appointing student 
representatives to different campus-wide 
committees, and ensuring that the council 
is following the AS Constitution and its 
bylaws. 

However, l PLAN TO GO ABOVE 
AND BEYOND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF 
MEl I will work with the Executives 00 
action plans on issues such as student/ 
financial autonomy, outreach and 
retention, and parking. Also, I plan to 
work with the incoming Acadftllic Affairs 
Commissioner on extending the deadiine 
for the "W" grade. 

Elect STUDENTS FOR PROGRESS;

The purpose 01 any student coundl is 
to represent students' needs and to push 
for change that will improve student Ilk. 
The Student MoY~ment lnitillting 

Leiid~rshi P and Empowerment 
(S.M.LLE.) sees many ways in which to 
attack problems lacing students. 

As the S.M.I.LE. candidate for Vice 
President Finance, I am committed to 
using the powers in that office to deal 
with important student issues. The V.P. 
Finance position is more than jusl 
knowing about numbers and budget 
figures. It is about working with people. 

There are hundreds of student 
organizations that attempt to put on 
various events every year. Yet, the 
financial process can sometimes frustrate 
tudents. 1 believe that it is the duty of the 

V.P. Finance and Associated Students to 
create an atmosphere that will allow 
events to be planned more effectively and 
efficiently. 

Along with the S.M.I.LE. team, I am 
also interested in working on other issues 
like parking. the co-ops, and fees. So 
please remember to vote S.M.I.L.E on 
April 7$,9. 

Shemn KHODDAM 
As the Fifth College representative to 

the Student Organization Finance Board 
and the AS Financial Controller, I have 
gained valuable skills and experience on 
several AS boards and committees in 
which the VP Finance chairs or attends. 
As the Fi fth College Semi-Formal 
Treasurer and Commissioner of Specia l 
Events and Projects, l have experienced 
the process of funding and planning 
events. I have identified several actions 
that need to be taken in order to ensure 
student funds are used to the fullest to 
better student life. 

One of the cruea I changes that needs 
to be done is to bring about financial 
autonomy. I wish to strive to get the AS 
their own business office and control over 
their funds to allow students' interest to 
be best represented. 

I plan to ensure students' interests are 
represented through beller relations and 
communications with students and 
student organizations. Through bi· 
qUMterly forums and ev al ua lions of the 
linance process, I would like to restructure 
and improve the way funds are aUocated. 
I also plan to stop drastic fee increases 
with ideas I developed when I lobbied in 
Sacramento. 

Please vote April 7 - 9 to ensure the 
implementation of these action plans and 
to bring leadership and experience to the 
office of the VP Finance.

Fees an! going up, and quality if going

seen move lifter move toward weaker 
student control over student money. With 
the co-op crises this year. the extensIOn of

funds, and the inability of either the AS or 
the UCB to control the funds they need to 
represent students in either of these cases, 
students at UCSD are entering one of the 
most critical elections in a long time. If the 
next administration of student govern-
ment at UCSD does not act immediately 
and decisively, the student position is 
poised to spiral{)ut of control. 

The Students For Progress slate is the 
student administration that can make the 
dramatic structural changes needed to 
create genuine student representation on 
the UCSD campus. 

I chose to join the slate because each of 
the sla te members has the experience and 
innovation to make the changes that could 
otherwise only be outlined. The situation 
we face now demands the experience the 
Students For Progress slate can deliver. 
Make that demand when you vote April 7

COMMISSIONER OF 
COMMUNICATIONS 

aetty HAl 
My name is Betty Hai and I am 

currently running for the office of 
Commissioner of Communications. In 
deciding to run for this office, I consulted 
the alternative media which A.S. funds in 
order to get a feel for the media 's concerns 
and expectations of the Commissioner. 
From these interviews I found that the 
majority of media wanted regular 
maintenance of the com purer room, 
updated software, more lenient policies on 
funding. fair bidding of A.S. advertising 
money, and more visible newsstands. 

Upon these requests and concerns, I 
will base my platform in this election. 
These are issues I will address if elected. I 
fcelthat my further experience as current 
Public Relations officer for Asian &< Paci fic 
Islander Student Association, Director of 
Public Relations for Vietnamese Student 
Associa lion, and a member of the 
contributing staff of the alternative media 
paper, Momentum, l have both the 
interpersonal experience in interacting 
with people and the first hand observation 
of the inner workings of a med ia paper to 
competently address these issues in the 
upcoming year. , 

I encourage UCSD students to vo te on 
election day and to consider me as 
Commissioner of Communications. 

Sharon OH 
As the former chair of the AS. Media 

Committee. there have been changl'S in 
the workings of the various medias on 
campus. A primary changed that 
occurred in this past term has been the 
reorganization and repairs of the media 
computer facilities. The Media Committee 
and I also allocated funds from our new 
media budget account for three new 
medias. These new medias will add to the 
diversity of the campus papers. In 
addition, a computer assistant for the 
media computer room was hired to 
improve the communication linkage 
between the Media Committee and the 
campus medias. Utilizing this computer 
assistant has made a remarkable 
difference. It has helped facilitate 
production, and answer any questions or 
concerns. 

Lastly, I not only will ensure that all 
medias adhere to policies, regulations, and 
procedures, but tha,t stu9f!Jt media funds 
are spent in the ~t interest for the 
students. Also, I think by having 
experience: getting to know the media 
staff members on a more personal level, 
desiring to improve communication lines, 
and having continuity as the formN A.5. 
Commissioner of Media, I can "Make It

education abroad program, various 
religious group., the City of San Diego, 
and a wide range of charitable organiz.l· 
lions, such as Muscular Dystrophy, 
AMOR Ministril'>, Habitat foc Humanity, 
and Special Olympics. 

I plan to fulfill my responsibility to the 
seniors of Revelle College by helping you 
to be better prepared for the most 
traumahc period of University life-
graduation. To do this, I would like to 
institute a faculty mentor program for 
ju nior and senior students. 

In coni unction, I would also like to 
establish an industrial placement program 
on which the academic departments would 
help students find in tern /coop/ 
pennanent positions with an industry, 
laboratory, govenunent agency, hospital, 
or pri va te firm of their choice. 

Under these programs, students will 
receive betler advising from their 
department, and be given the opportunity 
to gain invaluable experience at the 
undergraduale level. 

Since you will all one day be seniors, 
these ideas will be of benefit to each of

safer, well tit paths k>ading to and lrom 
this area. Creating new call box locations, 
specifically around this and other areas 
must also be looked at. Construction sites 
all over campus h.ave also caused potential 
safety hazards due to the lack of light. Bus 
and Shuttle stops all over campus must 
also ha VI' better lighting. Another issue 
would have to be the parking situation at 
the Revelle lots. Both commuters and

active in programming and publicity for 
Third 's Commwlity Programming Board

I would fight for a much stronger

hard for all students' rights. Just back 
from Sacramento in an UCSD student 
effort to lobby against the floe hike, I will 
encourage A.s. to become its own

legal standing to protect student interests. 

The senior Senator will be a more 
\~sible participant in the Third CoIll'ge 
and UCSD student community. My only 
campaign promises are to be a good 
listener and make sure Third students 
have a voice on this campus.

Jun. ROBBINS 
I have chosen to run lor Warren junior 

Senator because I feel that there are many 
issues that need to be addressed, such as 
student safety, issues of sensibvity, and 
publicity at Warren. 

My experience working with the 
Warren College students and staff would 
aid me in representing the student body at 
Warren. This year I have served as 
Warren Apartment Governmenl C(;(hair, 
Commissioner of Athletics on Warren 
College Student Council. and Metamor-
phosis lntern for the Warren Dean's office. 

I feel the issues AS will be dealing 
with this year are extremely important. 
As a senator I would encourage more 
participation and input from the students. 
I am very confident that I can uccessfully 
represent Warren College students for the 
1992-93 school year.

Due to my past involvement at

interest in how governing bodies effect, 
not only the activities but, the overall 
climate at UCSD, I have decided to run for 
Warren Sophomore Senator. 

I am presently Warren College 
Freshperson Senator to AS. I am very 
involved at Warren College, not only 
through Warren College Student Council 
but as a 1992 Warren Orientiltion Leader. 

As Warren Freshperson Senator, this 
year I have been able to S<'t' how AS works 
and the issues thaI cona>m students at 
UCSD. If elected, beyond just the basic 
meeting requirements I have found a 
number of issues that I hope to work on at 
Warren as my Senatorial projects for 92-
93. These issues are student safety and 
parking. issues of sensitivity, and Warren 
student involvement on campus. 

Because of recent construction 
students are being provided with less than 
adequate safety measures. Warren has 
also lost the majority of its student 
parking. These conditions will continue if 
the proposed lot 701 is instituted.

I am creative, fun loving. energetic, 

and pride myself on doing very well 
academically. I am a leader among my

Hello, my name is Winifredo aval 
and I am S<'t'king the position of Fifth 
College junior Senator. I intend, along 
with my lellow UNm' slate members, to 
represent my individual college in such a 
manner that is compatible with t.he needs 
of the integrated campus. The proper 
balance between onc's loyalty to 
individuat colleges and one' recognition 
and respect for the wider arena of UCSD 
as a whole should b what every AS 
Senator should strive for. That is exactly 
wha t I wish to accomplish. I will act as an 
elfl'Ctive liaison betwl'('n Fifth Council and 
AS in all issues that affect Fifth 's junior 

I population. 
As a commuter since my first yea r, I 

know the full range of experiences 
undergone by commuters and will try to 
change those which are dl'('med 
"undesirable". I will also be attending 
Fifth's commuter studrnts' assocIation 
meeting to directly find these ou I. 

Another priority of course is 
awareness 01 the residents' needs as well. 
I will accomplish this by keeping in touch 
with Res Life councils and leaving myself 
accessible for comments and suggestions. 
Vote Unity. Build Community al UCSD. 

Mike SCHELKE 
Make It Happen 

The Fifth College "Junior" Senalor 
does not solely deal with concerns of the 
current Junior class. Instead, every year, 
every fifth College student votes for each 
Senate position. Thus, while the junior 
Senator expresses the interests of the 
junior class, in reality, the Junior Senator 
is a representative of the entire Fifth 
CoUege student body. If elected, I will 
advocate the interests of Filth College in 
A.S, and the students' interests before 
FCC. For the past two years, I ha\'c 
primarily concerned myself with the 
internal affairs of Fifth College as a two-
year member of the Fifth CoUege judicial 
Board and last year's Filth College 
Election Commissioner. Currently, I work 
as a Counselor-Aide at Kearny High and 
Wangenheim junior High for ~rly 
Academic Outreach. This experience has 
shown me that all students must ha ve the 
opportunity to be as successfuJ as 
possible. All Fifth College students, 
whether in the forms, Pepper Canyon, or 
the commuters must be informed of all 
that occurs. This can be accomplished 
only if the "Fifth Dimension" newspaper 
is ci ncuIa ted more and more read i1y 
available Commuter Student bulletins. 
My "agenda" is what Fifth College wants, 
being your sound-board in Fifth CoUege 
and the AS.

E D I 

OURPrCK 
FORPREZ: 

~I/, A.S. President 

T 

The president is the guiding tl Mike Holmes ~ force behind the AS., and will be responsible for setting the tone for next year's council. This year, four ambitious student politicians are battling 
for the office of AS. Presi-

dent. All four have been hip-deep in campus 
politics at one time or another, and three of 
them are seasoned AS. veterans. 

Ely ....... is the most radical of the 
four presidential candidates this year. He is 
the true outsider in the sense that he has 
never served on A.S. Council, although he 
has worked closely with the external affairs 
office in recent months in an effol1 to 
combat the impending 24 percent fee hike. 
Rabani's platfonn calls for "incremental and 
fundamental changes" in the structure of the 
A.S. Council in response to what he 
describes as "heightened pressures" from 
the administration. Specifically, Rabani 
wants to convene a constitut ional conven-
tion in order to radically restructure the A.S. 
Council and "accord the students with a 
voice." 

Under his participatory democracy 
scheme, any interested student attending an 
A.S. meeting would be accorded a vote. One 
potentially major stumbling block that arises 
from such a plan is that any well-organized 
special interest group (i .e. the co-ops or the 
Greeks) could dominate the voting. Accord-
ing to Rabani. the council would have the 
power to defer the outcome of questionable 
votes, usually by placing them on the ballot 
as a referendum for the entire studenl body 
to decide. 

Rabani wants radical change. "Every-
body has to be ready for this." he said. " If 
this is not the vision that people have, it may 
well serve people to vote for one of the 
other candidates who are focused on 
marginal change." He is. however, quite 
inexperienced and his platfonn is a bit 
fantastic. Democratization will work only if 
the students want to make it work. On a 
campus where less than 15 percent of the 
students bother to vote in student elections, 
it requires an incredible leap of faith for one 
to accept that the student body will suddenly 
stan to "get active." What is more likely is 
that organized special interests - the co-
ops, the Greeks, the SAAC organizations 
and so on - will take advantage of the 
system, and that ultimately serves no one. 

............... is the odd fish in 
this pool of presidential candidates. Always 
the eccentric. Schnurer is the quintessenlial 
protest candidate. The former two-and-a-
half tenn commissioner of programming 
earned himself the reputation of the 
"problem child" of the A.S .. fighting with 
the president over the cultural content of 
TGs, being kicked out of his office for using 
the Price Center as a "hotel," and finally 
resigning last fall quaner after he tried and 
failed to convince the council to give him a 
$200/week raise. 

But Schnurer insists he is a serious 
candidate, Although he is supposed to 
graduate this year (finally), he says that if he

OURENDO~EMENTSFOR 
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL AND 
COMMISSIONER POSmONS: 
VICe President 
Adminisbative 
No Endorsement 

The vice president administrative is the 
second most powerful position on the AS . 
council. In :lddition to conducting the council 
meetings. the VP administrative is in charge 
of campus-wide appointments. 

This wa:> a particularly difficult position to 
endorse because of the overall inadequacy of 
both candidates. A.S. Commissioner of Public 
Relations Randolph Siwabessy has come a 
long way in JUSt one year. Last year he had no 
c lear focus, but he soon found one. 

As commissioner of public relations. he 
established Authorized Propaganda, an 
appropriately named P.R. organ charged with 
reponing all of the great things the A.S. 
Counci l is doing. 

1f elected. Siwabessy wants to improve 
communications between council members 
and student organizations and revise the 
bylaws to eliminate the confusion which has 
cropped up after years of endless tinkering. 
This year, his agenda seems to be much 
clearer, but insufficiently so. 

The other candidate, current A.S. President 
Pro Tem Poncho Guevara, dwelled on such 
vagaries as empowennent and unity, but 
hardl y mentioned the internal working aspects 
of the post he seeks. He also spoke to some 
ex tent abou l the high rate of student attrition 
and the retenllon problem. While Ihe~e are 
imponanl I~~ue\. they have lillie to do wilh 
the actual work of the VP adminj~trative 
position. 

Neither candidate gave a strong impression 
that he has the son of leadership skills 
necessary to do the job. Both seem to lack a 
clear idea of the real demands of the job, 
despite their strong assurances to the contrary. 

While neither candidate inspires a great 
deal of confidence. one of them is goi ng to get 
the job. 

Of the two, Siwabessy is the most able. but 
we are unable to endorse either. 

Vice President 
External Affairs 
Colin Wilson 

The vice president external position is one 
of the most imponant positions on the 
council. TIle VP external is responsible for 
dealing with groups outside UCSD, especially 
the city and state governments. TIle most 
important tasks facing the VP ex ternal next 
year will be to cont inue the fight against 
further fee increases and to lobby the state 
legislature to pass several bills that will 
impact future student fees. 

Colin Wilson is the only candidate running 
fo r the VP extemal post. He has worked in the 
AS. external affairs office for almost two 
years. Last year he directed campus lobby 
efforts. and this year he serves as the state 
lobby director. He has an excellent command 
of the issues, and we strongly support his 
candidacy.

The vice president finance controls the 
details of the A.S. budget, specifically the 
allocation of funds 10 student organizations. 
There are two candidates for this position:

Election 
Sidelights 
Notes and observations on 
the A.S. elections: 

Gi_SomeM_, 
In its continuing quest to 
cover all the issues, the New 
Indicator asked A.S. 
candidates to respond to two 
questions . The second of 
them complains about A.S. 
advertising in the Guardian 
and the tack of funding for the 
NI, even though it gets more 
funding than any other A.S. 
paper. including the Koala. 
The other question was about 
the fee increase. It's good to 
see the NI has its fingers on 
the pulse of student 
concerns: the cost of 
education and the campus 
left-wing paper's budget. 

A Miauna of Pfo.ActJvtt, 
How can you tell when A.S. 
candidates speak In jargon? 
Their lips move The hottes 
buzzwords. . pro-actIve - and 
"empowerment. - Others 
warned of a "miasma' of fees 
and rem inded us about their 
multiple "foci." Indeed, focus 
was a prime concem. A 
candidate who last year said, 
"I have no clear focus ... oh , 
yes I have' this year totd us 
about his new "internal 
focus. " 

De Schnur., File 
We don't know if Man 
Schnurer has a future as an 
A.S. president. but he may 
have one in comedy. Quoth 
Matt: 'I 've had half the 
administration up my ass, 
and it's really uncomfort· 
able." On UC fee increases , 

, he said they will continue 
"unless the Japanese buy 
Callfomia.· When asked what 
he would do differently from 
this year's A.S.: "Firebomb." 
A solution to fee hikes: -Why 
not mothball. .. [San Diego] 
State?" And on the way to 
restore TGs: "There 's no 
going back ... aside from a 
few assasinations. But I 
didn't say that." 

Auggie WJJo7 
The ineffectiveness of A.S. 
President Agustin Orozco was 
a recurring theme this year, 
with many observing that VP 
Administrative Mike Holmes 
served as de facto president. 
One candidate said it best: 
-Right now. I see that as 
Mike Holmes' Job ... uh. the 
president's job.-

Khoddam and fonner Culture Quest Commit-
tee Co-Chair Michael Garcia. Khoddam is an 
A.S. insider and appean. to be a fiscal 
conservative, which is essential for the VP 
finance position. especially in these precarious 
economic times. He plans to carefully review 
the budgets of every student organization and 
AS. depanment to detennine how much 
funding is absolu tely needed. 

Garcia says that his experience "from the 
other side" (as an event coordinator and former 
Student Affirmative Action Comminee represen-
tative) has given him an excellent perspective on 
the policies that go along with funding. 

However, he expressed interest in making 
the finance bylaws "more fair" and "more 
efficient" - in other words. he wants to ease 
the regulations on A.S. funding. This is an 
alanning proposal, espec ially coming from 
someone who has been involved mostly with 
special interest groups which compete for 
precious funding. and even moreso consider-
ing the AS . Council'~ history of runaway 

• spending.

h", e a faIrly goo<.llut:a about whal the job 
entatb. Khoddam t ~ clearly the better 
candidate. He wants to put the Associated 
Students' teeteri ng house in order, and we are 
confident that he has the ski lls necessary to do 
the job. We endorse Khoddam's candidacy. 

Commissioner of 
Operations, ServIces 
and Enterprises 
Paul Wilcox 

Paul Wilcox, the incumben" is running for 
reelection uncontested. He is intimately 
familiar with the requirements of the post and 
has done a fine job th is year. Next year, he is 
looking for ways to bring the student credit 
union back on campus and improve service at 
the Grove Caffe. Wilcox is more than 
qualified for the position, and we endorse his 
candidacy wholeheanedly. 

Commissioner 
of Programming 
No Endorsement 

Robb Earnest is running for this post 
unopposed, which is a shame because he isn ' t 
pallicularly well-qualified. He has some 
experience as chainnan of this year's Sun 
God Festival, but that simply isn't enough. 
His ideas were somewhat vague and unrealis-
tic by his own admission. In regards to the 
TGs, he was obviously unfamiliar with the

OVERDUE$? 
UCSD Ubrary will implement a new billing policy beginning Spring 
Quarter, 1992. that will aITeet all library borrowers. This will be the 
procedure for overdue or lost library items: 

• A courtesy reminder stating that items are overdue will be se~t 
shortly after the due date. 

• If materials are not returned or renewed. a second notice will 
be sent stating that a non<ancellable overdue fee of $7 .00 has 
been levied. 

• If materials are still not returned . borrowing privileges will be 
suspended and a bill will be issued which indudes replace-
ment cost of the item(s). a $7.00 overdue fee. a $20.00 
processing fee and a $7.00 billing selVice charge. 

• If an item is recalled and not returned by its revised due date 
an additional $14.00 charge will be imposed. 

You may renew items on or before their due date. or before 
overdue items have accrued the overdue fee. by telephoning or 
stopping at the circulation desk of any UCSD library. Library 
materials (except ReselVe items) may 
be returned to any branch. If you 
have questions about these policy 
changes, or other borrowing policies. 
call 534-3339. The ubrary is not 
responsible for undelivered mail. UCSD LIBRARY

over their fees. they have control over their 
facilities . and they have the ability to go out 
and get outside le&aI counsel. Here at UCSD. 
we don't have the same sort of prIVileges or 
rtgIlts .... I think that rig/lt now It's n10fe fea-
sible than ever .... there 's !leen a lOt of outside 
pressure on the university In the past years to 
try to 10 toward aettJng every campus those 
same type of rIehts. The outside pressure 
"'om federal and state courts has had IItlie 
Impact as far as ,ettlre the regents to grant 
extensions to the policy they've set forth ... 
which states tIIat the student assoclatoons 
actually do not have full autonomy. and that 
they have no control O'oIer their own facil~ 
ties .... However. what I see at UCSD right now 
- some sort of WIndow of opportunity - we • 
have Intemallegal pressures as well. So with 
the two pressures coming on the university at 
this time. and with UCB and A.S. contemplat·

the person that Joe Watson would pick to go

more of a very businesslike, sometimes even

that I've !leen able to maintain a workIng 
relationshIP with many administrators .... I do 
feel that many times It·s up to the student 
leaders. especially the A.S. pres ldenl.to take 
the effort to make sure those relations are not 
disrupted and that student leaders on this 
campus are able to have that doorway open to 
negotiation and, even at times. compromise 
to tty to get some of our goals accomplIshed. 
If you go in there and you're aggressive and 
you're not compromlsll'( ... you' re not golngto

Integral partolour IIIe here at UCSD.I grew up 
In thiS university With them. and this Is the first 
year that I've seen them taken away. And to 
me. thinking 01 TGs , It's been a long year. no! 
having them .... However, this is one of those 
·transltlonal' trial periods that Dr . Watson IS 
so lamous for having ... . And a lot of student 
money was being wasted on what I fe lt was 
bureaucratic. technical things that the JAI!» 
hoi and Substance Abuse CommIttee! fell. .. 
needed to happen. such as a retreat. basi· 
cally. of alcohol awareness for the 
councilmemOers .... to spend student money 
on 40 or less memllers of this campus. In· 
stead of doing ~ for the people whO come to 
the TGs. I thInk Is ridiculous .... We wore 
successful. just last week. In being able to 
eliminate a comedy speaker that spoke every 
time a TG happened. someone wno'd come

MH: I think that when people comolaln about 
theA.S. media. the policy of the ~.S. snouldbe 
one of sensitivity and communicatIOn, to let 
students know and let the media know what 
this confliCt Is. and try to resolve it In that 
fashion. However. I diSagree to say that the 
"'.5. should step In and try to dictate to that 
campus newspaper wIlat Is sensitive. what Is 
Insensitive. what they can print. what they 
cannot print. That just c.n·t happen .... That 
the A.S. should just step In and cut off funding, 
dOesn't wOrk ... not reaally, enCinot In my mind. 
So When you're talkine aIlout next year's 
fundine ... I see a bud&et that goes ... toward 
the campus media so tIIat wo can have a 
dIverse communication base on this campus 
which Is actually very rare systemwide. I mean. 
I love to tlf8& to Irvine students about hOW 
many media we have on this campus. They 
h<Ne one. And the budiet Is golrC to reflect a 
very diverse media that's lolne to be able to 
have control of their own publication.
