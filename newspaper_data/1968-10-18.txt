Slack Students 
Parties 

Stop 
at UCSS 

Sixteen black students took 
over North Hall at UCSB Mon-
day, and then gave it up after the 
Associated Students Judicial 
Committee recommended sus-
pended suspensions for all those 
involved. At 6 p.m. Monday, 
Chancellor Vernon I. Cheadle 
accepted the recommendation. 
Suspended suspension means the 
suspension will go on the stu-
dents' records, but the suspen-
sions will not go into effect un-
til and if they involve themselves 
in some other illegal activity. 

Earlier Monday, the adminis-
tration had granted seven of the 
eight demands of the Black Stu-
dent Union (BSU). The demands 
were, briefly: 

- The establishment of a com-
mission designed to investigate 
problems resulting from person-
al or individual racism. 

-The development of a college 
of Black Studies. 

-Reaffirmation of President 
Hitch's directive calling for in-
creased hiring of minority per-
sons. 

- The hiring of a black female 
counselor for the Educational 
Opportunity Program (EOP). 

-The appointment of black 
coaches ·whenever this becomes 
possible.' ' 

-Non-condonement of any har-
assment by any students, what-
ever color. 

-The development of a com-
munity relations staff to be 
«actively prosecuted." 

The statement, issued by the 
Chancellor's office, made no 
mention of the first demand, ask-
ing for the firing of Athletic 
Director Jack Curtice and Ar-
thur Gallon, head of the Physi-
cal Activities department. 

The Blacks moved in at 6:30 
a.m. quickly barricading them-
selves inside with desks, tables, 
and chairs. With a bullhor n 
from a second story window, 
they appealled for support from 
the gathering crowd of white 
students. ·How many black pro-
fessors on campus? How many 
black coaches? How much black 
literature in the library?" the 

asked rhetorically. "Our aim is 
not to destroy this building, our 
aim is to get some justice." 

One thousand white students 
did come to show their support, 
or at least their interest. They 
supplied the blacks witJt food and 
chanted their approval. Initially, 
their mood was restive, but after 
withdrawal of the police and an 
appeal for courage by a pro-
fes sor, the mood changed to an 
incongruous relaxation. 

What concessions the blacks 
did receive were the outcome 
of talks with the chancellor be-
ginning at 10 a.m. after pre-
liminary talks with their Deans. 

Reaction from student organi-
zations started on Tuesday when 
seven members of the UCSB 
Legislative Council issued a 
statement sympathizing with the 
grievances of the black students 
who took over North Hall, but 
condemning the actions of "white 
agitators who (acted) irrespon-
sibly. • 

The statement charged that 
the white students "irresponsi-
bly attempted to link the import-
ant issues raised by this event 
to selfish, personal causes.· 

It also praised Vice Chancel-
lor Stephen Goodspeed and Dean 
of Students Lyle Reynolds for 
their handling of the situation, 
supported the findings of the A.S. 
Judicial Board and the Chancel-
lor 's decision to support their 
ruling, and supported the "un-
derstanding reached between the 
blacks and the Chancellor.' 

Bruce Harger, a represen-
tative on the Legislative Council 
issued a statement of his own 
called «The Majority Manifesto" 
forming a new student grcup, 
Free Campus.

You're from the University of California, 
aren't you? . .I'm going to come back to 
California and you just try me then. 
(Editor's note: the following is 
a transcription of the Huntley-
Brinkley report broadcast over 
NBC television on Tuesdayeven-
ingconcerning his San Diego 
appearance. ) 

Wallace is winding up a three 
day tour of California. NBC cor-
respondent David Burrington re-
ports on new difficulties Wallace 
is having with hecklers. 

George Wallace prides himse lf 
on his ability to handle hecklers. 
He ridicules the m, outshouts 
them, prodding his own fans into 
a frenzy of support. But this 
time it didn't work. The pro-
testors tried a reverse psychol-
ogy. Several hundred, many of 
them dressed in hippie garb, 
cheered and hollered and went 
wild at everything Wallace said. 
They called themselves anar-
chists for Wallace and they con:' 
trolled the rally. (We want Wal-
lace, we want Wallace.) 

At first Wallace couldn't figure 
out what was happening. "Ladies 
and gentlemen, this group back 
here on the left - if you're for 
me you'll just let me go ahead 
and speak. But wait just a 

minute. I think those are some 
students who are trying to have 
some fun. You're from the Uni-
versity of California, aren't you? 
Well if you're for me let me go 
ahead and speak, that's right." 

But they would not let him 
speak and the tactic was de-
vastating. Wallace himseif got 
angry and flustered. His fans 
were furious, but there wasn't 
really much they could do about 
it. Generally the scene was 
pandemonium: 

-That's right you little punk 
you, why don't you come on up 
here?-

Another bunch of hecklers fol-
lowed the old tactics so there 
was a constant counter between 
the two groups, and for once 
George Wallace found himself 
nearly drowned out. 

"I'll tell you what - when I'm 
elected I'm going to come back • 
to California and you just try 
me when 1 get back. 

There was so much racket 
that few could hear what the 
candidate was saying and a num-
ber of his fans got up and lett 
in disgust. , 

as r y even g ,on he 
Channel 8 KFMB evening news 
reporter Harold Keen quoted 
a segment of the Eldr dge Clea-
ver speech which was printed 
in the October 11 issue of the 
Triton Times. 

He stated that the new group 
was "dedicated to protecting that 
academic freedom which is cur-
rently threatened by the New Pur-
itanism--the belligerent, in-
tolerant attempt by a self-ap-
pointed elite to force the Uni-
versity community--students, 
facu rty, and adm inistration--to 
knuckle under to a dogmatic, au-
thoritarian, "revolutionary mor-
.ality--a new Establi~hment." 

Cleaver Gives 2nd 139Xi 
The quote was a chant employ-

ing a four letter word by the 
audience expressing their feel-
ings for the Governor of Cali-
fo rnia. A civilian employee of 
the University had called Mr. 
Keen expressing shock at the 
use of such words in the school 
newspaper. 

Mr. Keen called the Times 
office to get the entire context 
of the quote and its accompany-
ing editor's comments. 

Although Mr. Keen 'did not 
question the newspaper's right 
to record precisely wbat Cleaver 
had said (along with the entire 
udience) be asked his TV au-
ience if tlley agreed that it was 
rhaps not sound judgment by 

he editor to do so. 
We wish to thank Mr. Keen 

or his comments and hope that

first '"egal LecturelAt Cal 
Eldridge Cleaver delivered the 

second of ten scheduled lectures 
in Social AnalysiS 139X last Tues-
day at Berkeley. This was done 
despite an earlier ruling by the 
Board of Regents that guest lec-
turers would only be permitted 
to speak once each quarter. 

The subject of Social Analysis 
139X is «Dehumanization andRe-
generation in the American So-
cial Order.· Cleaver's second 
lecture was concerned with the 
importance of the historical as-
pects of racism. Cleaver pointed 
out that in order to fully under-
stand racism it must be viewed 
as an historical process, and not 
merely as a ·spontaneous· event. 
The first important relationship 
between blacks and whites was 
that of slavery, and though this 
relationship has been modified 

it has not really been destroyed. 
Cleaver spoke before an esti-
mated 400 people in Berkeley's 
Dwinell Hall, only persons of-
fiCially enrolled as students or 

·auditors were allowed to attend. 
. All members of the news media 
were banned from the auditorium. 

The second lecture given by 
Cleaver is actually the third 
given in the Social Analysis 139X 
course. The second lecture of 
the course was given by Troy 
Duster, a professor of Sociology 
at Berkeley. other persons sche-
duled to lecture in 139X this 
quarter include Oakland Police 
Chief Charles Gaine and Ernesto 
Galarzo, author and leader in 
the Delano movement. 

Social Analysis 139X is per-
haps the most controversial 
course taught at erkeley. As 

of this moment Chancellor 
Heynes has refused to grant any 
credit for the class. He has 
instructed the Registrar's Office 
to refuse all official study lists 
which include Social Analysis 
139X for credit. Meanwhile the 
faculty has voted, through the 

cademic Senate, to go on re-
cord as beUeving that the course 
should be given for credit as 
originally planned. Further, 
they have called the action by 
the Board of Regents a dangarous 
infringement upon Academic 
freedom. As of the moment, 
the issue of course credit is 
still unresolved, although many 
students at Berkeley who are 
enrolled in Social Analysis 139X 
for credit seem to Ueve that 
the Chancellor will eventually 
have his way.

Outlines 
Goals 

by Kern Carson 
In recent weeks there has been 

some attention drawn to the Ed-
ucational Opportunities Pro-
gram. This has, therefore, 
prompted some individuals to ask 
what it is all about. 

1 will not address myself to 
the recent article in the Indica-
tor. However, in reference to 
that and the description which 
I am going to give you of the 
program, I would like for you 
to determine if you would like 
to be a part of the solution or 
a part of the problem. 

Whichever alternative you 
choose, it is time to stop the 
bull ..... and legitimize your com-
mitment instead of your concern. 

The University of California at 
San Diego has responded to one 
of the many problems facing 
this country today. 

Since 1965, the University has 
made educational opportunities 
available to students from a mi-
nority or low-income back-
ground. 

I would be the first to say 
that the Educational Opportun-
ities Program, itself, is not e-
nough. The University must 
become an integral part of com-
munity services and programs 
and make larger commitments. 

This is a step in the right 
direction and with a joint, con-
certed effort by the University 
and community persons, we can 
be instrumental in changing some 
of the social conditions of San 
Diego. 

The purpose of the Education-
al Opportunities Program is to 
enroll as many qualified and 

• near-qualified students from mi-
nority groups or low-income 
backgrounds, assist them in fi-
nancing their education if the 
need exists, and make available 
the academic support to help in-
sure their success as University 
students. 

It is the job of the I:.OP 
staff, in conjunction with high 
school counselors, junior coilege 
counselors, and community ac-
tion groups, to seek out and 
identify those students in mi-
nority or low-income communi-
ties and to advocate their admi -
sion. 

students with a 3.0 G.P.A. 
or better are eligible for ad-
mission to the University • 
These students, as well as those 
who may not have met all Uni-
versity requirements are en-
couraged to aj)ply. 

Their admi!'sion is made pos-
sible under t'le state law which 
allows 4 per cent of the fresh-
man class to ent r with ut m et-
ing aU admi slon requirements. 
Supporting such applications 
would be letters ofrecommeuu...-
tion from teachers and counse-
lors and also statements from 
the applicant regarding his aca-
demic goals.

If Wallace becomes President, 
one of two things will happen: 
I) If the popular reaction to his 
fascist police state, his racist 
ideology, and his brutally sense-

there will be a bloody revolu-

crushed and the American spirit 
mangled and mauled to the point 
where It restricts its world view 
to one pair of fanatical eyes. Or 

B) the revolution may be suc-
cessful in removing Wallace and 
his goons from power. If so,

the commitments for which the ASUCSD has spent a great deal of money

It was learned that the AS have two full-time employees on their 
payroll and that unless the referendum is passed, the AS will soon 
be broke. An election will soon be held and the referendum will he 
on the ballot. _ 

A resolution, introduced by Trish Cunningham and amended by 
Jon COllins, which in effect would have censured TNC for the con-
duct of the Eldridge Cleaver speech, was defeated. Instead, the 
following was passed: 

·Whereas recent activities for which appropriations were made 
by the ASUCSD program board were conducted In a manner consti-
tuting a breach of good faith with the above said party, be it resolved 
that the AS directs its program board to be responsible for all future 
events it funds.· 

This resolution was passed only after length parliamentary debate 
between the two contesting factions that were involved in the debate. 

The final resolution, as Introduced by Paul Ricks, was passed. 
The resolution was Introduced in an effort to eUminate the censure 

of TNC for an event that had been no fault of theirs: the overwhelming 
crowd that showed up from the San Diego educational community to 
hear Mr. Cleaver speak. 

The question of a Commissioner of School Spirit was raised. 
The office of head cheerleader will be fUled by election while the 
other cheerleaders wlll be selected in a different manner.

(American Independent Party 
band), who performed such weU 
known favorites among WalJace 
people as CDon't you ever get 
tired of hurtin' me?" 

The UCSD and State people 
really grooved out on these num-
bers - several got up and danced 
to the music. 

Tex, the leader of the baDd 
(or whatever else his name was) 
addressed the crowd: C Ah'v. 
been lookin' round trying to fiDd 
some of those other folks arid Ab 
don believe they're he're. Ab 
guess they must have lett tbe

However, Tex was somewhat 
mistaken. There were several 
of those naughty demonstrators 
on hand, although they were by 
far in the minotlty. One fellow 
rather ' conservatively dressed, 
had the gumption to parade around 
with a sign reading cKilIing peo-
ple with y 'ur car is not law and 
order or Justice" on one sl1le 
and ·Where is freedom in a pol-
Ice state?- on the other side. 

Of course, the UCSD rooting 
section really got down on him 
for that. 

Not to be outdone by anyone 
in enthusiasm, the UCSD and , 
state students staged their own 
parade around the fioor alter 
a group of Wallace labor men 
from Steamfitters local *52 held 
a mini· demonstration. 

After Tex introduced the fel-
lers in the band, the pre-game 
ceremonies came to an end and 
the opening ceremonies got under 
way. The older Wallace support-
ers present, who supposedly 
pride themselves on their pat-
riotism , were outdone once again. 
as the students -out-sung- them 
when the National Anthem was 
played. Could It be that the old 
folks didn't know the words too 
well? 

The pastor of Scott Memorial 
Baptist Church delivered an in-
spiring invocation, in which he 
thanked God for ·The speaker 
we have ton~ht - for his cour-
age , and for his patriotism." 

cWe pray that we might see 
anarchy, confuSion, and godless-

WaUace cODttaaed wtth b1s pre-
pared speech, but was nearly 
drowned out by heckling from 
the center section. He derided 
them merCilessly once more: 
-That's some oC the free speech 
folks who believe in free speech 
and be Heve in us ing four let-
ter words, you know, but I know 
two four letter words they don't 
know - W-O-R-K and S-O-A-P 

This choice derision was met 
with cheers from the rooting sec-
tion. "We want soap, we want 
soap" they chanted. 

Wallace continued with his re-
marks. ·We appeal to people 
of all races and color In this 
campaign. The capitalistic sys-
tem and the free enterprise sys-
tem and the constitution of our 
country is under attack and It 
is in the interest of all people 
of all races and color to re-
store and maintain the system." 

Next, Wal1ace attacked the an-
archists, and both Richard Nix-
on and Hubert Humphrey who, 
he said, had csuccumbed to the 
blackmail of a few anarchists.-
This statement brought such a 
resonse from the students that 
Wallace was again unable to con-
tinue. ·We want Wallace- cheers 
erupted again from the rooting 
sections. 

Contused and agered, Wallace 
walked to the ~ck of the podium 
to confer with his aides. He re-
turned to the microphone and at-
tempted to explain the situation 

to the crowd. 
cNow ladies and gentlemen, 

this group back here on the left 
11 you're for me you'll just let me 
go ahee.d and speak. But Just 
wait a minute, I think those are 
some students from the Univer-
sity of California, aren't you? 
Well, if your'e for me let me 
go ahead and speak." (More 
cheers from 'UCSD rooting sec-
tion .. 

Wallace conferred again with 
his aides and then continued. 
cNow ladies and gentlemen you 
have some students here tonight 
who pretend they are for us, and 
some on the other side and we 
know from police reports that 
they are colng to tango with one 
uou.r. 80 Ws is au made~. 

U your'e for me Just sit dOwn 
and let me talk. 

Your'e pretty clever. There's 
nothing to that (the demonstra-
Uon) but UCstudents who ,ought 
to be in the first grade instead 
of college. (More cheers from 
tile rooting section.) 

It seems that what was con-
fUsing Wallace was that there 
were two rival groups. The 
two groups on opposite sides 
of the arena, mainly dressed 
In hippie garb, were going wild 
at everything Wallace said. Sim-
ultaneously the center group was 
emplOying traditional tactics 
used by anarchists across the 
country. 

Conflicting cries of -We want 
Wallace- and CSsig Hell- lett 
the usually cool Wallace a lit-
Ue perturbed. 

He continued with his speech. 
-Both national parties have taken . 
away the right of the people of 
Alabama and California to decide 
their individual domestic poli-
cies.' 

At this point he was inter-
rupted again by chants ot -We 
want Wallace. - Wallace turned 
on the students again. ·Well 
you're not for Wallace. Go 
ahead and put on a show back 
there. What are they teaching 
in these colleges now?" 

Wallace turned again to the 
issue of federal intervention in 
the school system. "When I 
become ycur President not one 
dime of your federal tax money 
is going to be spent bussing any-
body anywhere they don't want 
to be bussed.-

The chant of ·no bussing, no 
bussing- that arose from the 
student rooting section inter-
rupted the presidential candidate 
again and he referred specl1lcal-
ly to the demonstrators: "Now 
you're the folks that people are 
getting sick and tired of in this 
country. You come up here 
after this speech and I'll auto-
graph your sandals tor 13, wan-
na do that?" 

Wallace continued with his 
speech. ci want to give you a 
plank out of our platform. So-
clal Security is basically an old 
age survinl and disability in-
surance plan that provldes for 
citizens to have a trust fund

in their reclining years. 

"If elected President I will 
Introduce legislation that pro-
vides for a 60% increase In 
overall benefits.-

Finally, Wallace reached his 
climax. -Now, let's talk about 
iaw and order,' (mucho cheers 
from the students). "...and 
when I become president some 
of you fellows in the back are 
going to get some law and order. 

·When I become President I'm 
going to stand behind the police 
and firemen and give them the 
moral support of the presidency. 
Police are a beleaguered and 
abused group in this country. 

"It's a sad commentary when 
you cannot walk In your neigh-
borbood at DJcbt. or 111 the sba- -

dOws of tbe White Rouse, beca_ ' 
anarchists have taken over. 

"So I want to tell you young 
tolks here tonight that when you 
lie down in front of my automo-
bile you won't be lying down in 
front of no more automobiles. 
I'll tell you what--l'm going to 
come back to California and you 
just try me when I get back.' 

A McCarthy supporter in the 
center section raised a sign In 
support of his (ex-) candidate. 
·Yes, law and order doesn't 
exist ••• (he spots McCarthyite). 
• . that's right you little punk, 
you. Why don't you come on up 
here.-

The demonstrator accepted 
Wallace's Invitation but was ab-
ruptly stopped by Wallace 
workers seated In front. A small 
scuffle ensued. 

Wallace continued with his dia-
tribe. "Why don't you young 
punks get out of the hall. I'm 
tired of you myself and the Amer-
ican people are tired of you.-
(Cheers from the center section: 
"We are the people, we are the 
people.-) 

Wallace, desperately trying to 
continue with his prepared re-
marks, turned to the Vietnam 
issue. cI sincerely hope that 
the negotiations in Paris are 
successfUl and that American 
servicemen can come home 
through an honorable negotiated 
peace, but It looks like that's 
going to fall, and if we fail in 
that diplomacy and I'm your 
president I'm going to ask for 
a military conclusion of that war 
with conventional weapons. 
We're not going to stay In Viet-
nam forever." 

Wallace turned on the college 
campuses again. "These college 

stu4i!Jllts em the eollege campuses 
are raising money, food, and 
clothing for the communists and 
they're nying the Viet Cong nag. 
You ask the attorney general 
why he doesn't do something 
about It and he says he's too busy 
bussing school children in L.A. 
and San Diego. 

"I'm telling you that when I 
become president, my attorney 
general will seek an indictment 
against any college professor or 
student calling tor a communist 
'rictory and put them in a good 
federal jail where they belong.-

(Chee~s from all quarters, 
espeCIally the stUdents.) 

"After the tragedy of the as-
sassination of Senator Kennedy, 
'trb.lch personifies the climate that 
bas arisen in this country because 
01 anarchy, the liberals wanted 
til pass a bill that called for 
registration of your guns. -

·Well, after the next tragedy 
they'll want to confiscate your 
CUns, and when that happens every 
law-abiding citizen in California 
would be without a gun, and every 
thug in California would have ten 
guns and a machine gun. 

'Well, I'm against this kind of 
legislation on a federal level." 
(students: We want guns, we want 
guns. ") 

Wallace defended the local 
folks down in Alabama. "They 
call us rednecks because we have 
lots of people like you have in 
California who don't mind getting 
red necks by an honest days work 
in the sun. Well, I've seen some 
folks in California whose necks 
won't ever get red because 
they've got too much hair on 
them.-

Finally, Wallace concluded his 
remarks--either by choice or be-
cause the enthusiasm of his sup-
porters and the heckling of his 
detractors made it impossible for 
him to continue. 

"And I wind up on this note--
that you anarchists had better 
have your day, because after 
November 5th you are through 
in this country. Thank you very 
much ladies and gentlemen.· 

And so it was over. The 
hundreds of students gathered af-
ter the speech to sing such pa-
triotic refrains as "God Bless 
America," and "My Country Tis 
of Thee.· They capped this oft 
with cheers of "hip-hip-hooray.-
The scene was strangely remi-
niscent of the Democratic con-
vention. 

However, In this case there 
was a difference. Here young 
people were constructively de-
monstrating the Ir support tor 
A merica and for one of her finest. 

It was unfortunate that George 
C. Wallace minconstrued the in-
tent of these idealistic, up-
standing students.

Fall Progres. Report 

UC Berkeley is this year's 
host for the annual all-Cal Soc-
cer Tournament, at which the 
Triton soccer team will parti-
Cipate for the fir st time. All 
of the players have been looking 
forward to this event which marks 
the high point of this year 's soc-
cer season. The tournament will 
last from Thrusday, October 17, 
to Saturday, October 19. 

There is a broom hanging on 
the locker room bulletin board 
with a sign next to it whicl1 
reads: 'Do not remove this broom 
--we had to use It against Gal 
Lutheran.' It was signed by the 
cross country team. 

To say the least, the UCSD 
cross country team last Saturday 
all but swept Cal Lutberan off' 
the Triton 4.6-mlle course. The 
harriers took the nrst six places 
with Jay Gillette finlsbing first 
with a time of 28 minutes, 53 
seconds. ' 

The next five UCSD runners 
came In within two minutes of 
Gillette, am uslnC the standard 
five-man team rule, the UCSD 
1-2-3-4-5 finish added up to 15 
points as opposed to Lutheran's 
49. The team is exceptionally 
strong this year and Is UCSD's 
pride of the fall sports teams. 

With a couple of big invlta-
Uonals coming up, the team Is 
readying for the all important 
Dlstriet m NAIA meet on Nov. 
16, and the Cal meet at UCSB 
on Dec. 7. 

Unfortunately, the cross coun-
try team hasn't passed the broom 
around to the other fall teams. 
The football, soccer, and water 
polo teams still lack experience 
and their performances thus far 
have shown it. 

This is not to say the tE'.l1ll 
hasn't improved. There isn't 
much similarity between the team 
that played LaVerne three weeks 
ago and the team the played 
Loyola. The offense has started 
to jell with UCSD quarterback 
Greg Gleason showing much im-
provement. 

The offensive line, though, has 
had the greatest Improvement. 
They worked together opening 
holes against Loyola giving UCSD 
backs, such as speedy halfback 
Manuel Myers, a chance to show 
their stuff. The Trltons were 
within Loyola's 20-yard line at 
least half a dozen times. The 
defense still needs work, though, 
as Loyola ran up the middle, 
around end, and generally all 
over the field. 

Loyola scored three Urnes 
from deep in UCSD territory, 
this because of pass interference 
calls against the Tritons on three 
long Loyola passes. When the 
defense can match up to the of-
fense, UCSD will be an excel-
lent football team. 

The other two fall teams, soc-
cer and water polo, are bothered 
by the same old problem: They 
have the potential but can't seem 
to work together as a team. 

The soccer team, now 0-5, 
lost Saturday to Cal state Ful-
lerton, 6-0. Coach Peter Sertlc, 
dismayed at the Tritons first 
half performanee, commented on 
the tough play in the second half. 
The fir st half was marred by 
poor defense, and th.e insertion 
of a new pUe, Jim Harrington, 
helped the Tritons In the second 
half wUh his long punts. 

. The water polo team has the 
same problem---tlot playlngtoge-
ther as a team. Against UC 
Riverside last Wednesday, they 
played Inconsistently and ended 
up with five points to UCR's 
12. Coach Tom Crocker said, 
'The main problem was that we 
couldn't get the ball in for the 
shot.' A senior, Bryon King, 
said simply, 'It was the worst 
we've ever played.' 

As with the soccer squad, there 
Is potential for a fine team. 
King, who scored all five goals 
against Riverside, was tough on 
offense and Rob Klnnelly was 
aggressive on defense. Unfor-
tunately, Lady Luck wasn't with 
them as half a dozen shots 
bounced off the rim in the first 
half. 

. The TrUons showed they eould 
do It, though, as they stormed out 
at the start of the fourth quar-
ter with a fast goal on a pic-
ture perfect play marked by pin-
point passing and good teamwork. 
With more of it, UCSD's water 
polo team wUl be one of our 
finest teams. 

All in all, UCSD's intercol-
legiate teams are providing ex-
citing action and they appreCiate 
the fans who get out and sup-
port them. True, we are not 
another Michigan State or UCLA 
yet, but that shouldn't stop you 
from going out and yelling some 
encouragement to UCSD's fall 
teams. 

So far the Triton booters have 
had little luck In their games . 
The lack of experienced players 
on the squad is the chief set-
back of the team. Nevertheless, 
the Tritons have a very enthu-
siastic and spirited squad, which, 
if properly incited, can give any 
team a tough game and walk 
off the field with a victory. 

The players that will repre-
sent UCSD are: Jim Harrington 
and Mike stone at goal; full-
backs Jeff Rhinesmith, Chuck 
Llebow, Bob Garvey, Tom Knight, 
Dan rSctl1kele, and Fred Grune-
wald; hal1backs BUI Bartels and 
Ned Neuman; Mike Ross, steve 
Hirsch, Bob Cunningham, Rand 
Wilson, and Randy Kaul at for-
ward. 

It is also hoped that star-
player Brent Thurston-~ogers 
will aceompanytheteam,andplay 
at the right halfback spot. Brent 
Is exactly what the team needs, 
since his great experience in-
stills a high sense of team mor-
ale on the rest of the squad. 

Last game, the Triton kickers 
gave up five goals during the first 
half against Cal state Fullerton, 
but with Thurston in the game 
for the second half the Fuller-
ton team only managed to score 
once, while the Tritons managed 
to mount some powerful attacks. 

Should some of the starting 
16 players be unable to attend 
due to last minute injuries, John 
Staple, a fullback, and steve 
Cooke, a halfback, will be al-
ternates. 

The starting forward line com-
posed of Mike Mross at· left 
wing, steve Hirsch at left in-
side, Bob Cunningham at right 
inside, and Randy Kaul at right 
wing, has shown a lot of ag-
gressiveness, but . is unable to 
put the ball Into the opponents 
goal from close up. 

But, with the powerful shooting 
of Mike Mross and steve Cun-
ningham, the Tritons are bound 
to cash in on a few goals. At 
any rate, both the offense and 
th.e defense are determined to 
make an honorable showing in 
every me the la. 

As Myers pointed out, the Tri-
tons' next opponent, Cal Western, 
is strong, they will be surprised 
by a tough UCSD team. That • 
game wtil be Nov. 2nd on the 
UCSD home field. No matter 

Trltoll I.,.rs 
S.Her first Loss 

The Cal Tech cross country 
team, led by a former Triton 
runner, handed lhe UCSD run-
ners their first loss up at Cal 
Tech Tuesday. 

The score was 18-39, low score 
winning. Gal Tech took the top 
four places In the 4.0 mUe course, . 
whOe the Tritons had to settle 
for fUth, sixth, seventh, ninth 
and twelveth places. 

Tomorrow the cross eountry 
team takes on Pasadena and UC 
Riverside in a trl-meet at 11:00 
a.m. on the Triton course.

Football Loses Third 
to the Loyola Lions 

The Triton football team took 
on the Loyola Lions last Satur-
day night, and played the Ir best 
game of the season although they 
sustained their third loss. The 
final score was Loyola 34, UCSD 
14. 

Loyola kicked off to UCSD and 
scored first after UCSD punted. 
The scoring play came on a 
Loyola recovery of their own 
fumble In the end zone. They 
kicked the conversion to make 
it 7-0. 

Gleason hit Mike Heredia with 
a pass In the end zone, for the 
Triton's first score. The con-
version attempt failed, making 
the score Loyola 7, UCSD 6. 

Loyola scored again after re-
ceiving the kick-off. 

The conversion was kicked by 
BUI Crone, making the score 
Loyola 14, UCSD 6. 

On a halfback option pass the 
Lions apparently scored again 
but they were penalized for an 
illegal receiver downfleld. Loy-
ola tried a reverse which gained 
·13 yards. Ertman then carried 
for the touchdown. The kick was 
successful and Loyola led 2lto 6. 

The half ended with San Diego 
trailing 21-6. 

Loyola received the kickoff 
and, despite some fine defensive 
plays, were able to score again. 
Coach Walter Hackett cited Alan 
Dwyer and Howard Nathanson for 
their fine play. Both player s 
played on offense and defense and 
were responsible for many of 

. the tackles made by the Tritons. 
The conversion was missed and 
the score was 27 to 6. 

The next time Loyola got the 
ball they were again able to 
score. Loyola quarterback Ert-
man was stopped by Bob Dosh, 
one of the few times the Tritoas 

were able to prevent Ertman from 
gaining a first down rushing. 
The conversion was good and the 
third quarter eDded Loyola 34, 
UCSD 6. 
A Gleason to Malcolm Glover 
pass resulted in the Tritons final 
touchdown. Gleason passed to 
Heredia for the two point con-
version. 

Gleason's other targets on the 
drive included Ringwood, Flour-
noy, Gary DaviS, Tom Grant and 
Charlie Nally. Coach Hackett 
praised both Gleason and Flourn-
noy for their efforts. He said 
Flournoy played his best game 
so far. He also commented 
that Gleason was learning rapidly 
and was handling the offense 
well.
