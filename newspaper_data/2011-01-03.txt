A�er the UC Board of Regents 
voted in January 2009 to cap freshman 
enrollment by 2,300, former UCI pro-
fessor Juan Hong sued the UC Board of 
Regents, claiming the members violat-
ed substantive due process in addition 
to state constitution contract clauses.

A�er losing at the Superior Court 
of California in the initial lawsuit, Hong 
�led an appeal that was then denied at 
the Fourth Appellate District, Division 
�ree on Nov. 29, 2010 under the logic 
that the UC Regents have rights to make 
internal policy and legislative decisions.

“�e California Court of Appeal af-
�rmed what the University of California 
had argued — that the university acted 
lawfully in taking steps to slow enroll-
ment growth,” UCOP spokesperson Steve 
Montiel said. “[�e UC system] will con-
tinue to o�er a place to every UC-eligible 
California resident applicant.”

Hong — who worked as a chemical 
engineering professor for 25 years and 
is currently practicing as a lawyer — ac-
knowledged that the Regents were not 
obligated to maintain enrollment and 
students had no rights for admission. 

“I know well about the UC because 
I had been with the University of Cali-
fornia for 20 years,” Hong said in an 
e-mail. “I thought the enrollment cut 
of 2,300 freshmen to save $20 million 
dollars was not right … I �led a lawsuit 
against the UC as a taxpayer of the state 
of California.”

In the original case, Hong cited 
Code of Civil Procedure section 526a 
— which states that tax-paying civilians 
can seek a judgment restraining waste-
ful government expenditures of funds 
for illegal expenses.

�e case report for Hong v. Regents 
of University of California explains 
Hong’s reasoning as that “the students 
have a property and contractual interest 
in having their applications considered 
under the 14 published criteria [for en-
rollment], not the unpublished budget 
reduction factor.” 

Hong cited Education Code section 
66011 — which guarantees the top 12.5 
percent of public high school graduates 
in California admission to one of the 
UC campuses — to �le to prevent rejec-
tion of the applicants. 

In addition, Hong pointed out that 
the brochures and catalogues containing

As 2010 drew to a close, the UC system underwent a number of changes to compensate for its loss of state funding. 
Student fees increased by 32 percent, the UC 
employee contribution to the retirement fund 
began after a 20-year break, and UC retiree health 
benefits decreased, while the age for retirement 
increased this past month. Now, top-tier UC 
employees — specifically, those earning more 
than $245,000 annually  — have threatened to sue 
the UC system if they do not receive a promised  
increase in retirement payments. 

In a letter sent to the UC Board of Regents on 
Dec. 9, 39 UC executives demanded the higher 
pension benefits promised to them in 1999 under 
the condition that the IRS raised the cap on 
pensions from the previously set $245,000. This 
cap was raised in 2007. The UC calculates pensions 
as a percentage of salary, up to a cap of $245,000, 
while those earning between $245,000 and $500,000 
receive $184,000 annually when they retire. 

After 2007, executives claimed the promised 
benefits were never allocated. The increase in 
benefits would cost the UC system an additional 
$5.5 million a year in addition to a one-time cost of 
$51 million to make the change retroactive to 2007. 

This threat comes at a time when the UC 
system faces a  $21 billion deficit in pension 
obligations, a deficit that nearly matches the 
current state budget deficit of $25.4 billion.  The 
pension gap is nearly the same as the university’s 

annual budget of $20.1 billion for 2009-10. 
Furthermore, incoming governor Jerry Brown 

said Californian public school will face even 
greater budget cuts, according to San Francisco 
Gate. In a written statement, Brown criticized the 
36 UC executives, calling them out of touch for 
demanding extra benefits when the state is facing 
billions of dollars in deficit that strongly affect 
people far less advantageous. 

In the 1980s, the state 
contributed about 5 percent of its 
general fund to the university but 
this share declined to approximately 
3.1 percent — about $2.6 billion — 
by 2009-10. While state funding 
increased to about $3 billion in 

2010-11, funding is predicted to decline further. 
The UC system has already begun to reduce 

its contribution to health care, from the current 
89 percent to 70 percent by 2018. For employees 
hired after July 1, 2013, the age for retirement will 
increase from 60 to 65.

The UC Commission on the Future was 
created last year to address the budgetary issues. 
The committee, co-chaired by UC President Mark 
G. Yudof and the UC Regents Chairman Russell 
Gould, released a report last December with 
recommendations —  20 of which were endorsed.

The recommendations include decreasing 
the time to earn a degree, increasing out-of-
state enrollment from 7 to 10 percent and 

exploring online instruction through an online 
course pilot program. According to UCOP 
spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez, decreasing time-
to-degree through pathways such as a three-year 
degree program or joint bachelors and masters 
programs would increase undergraduate spots for 
prospective UC students. 

“[Reducing time-to-degree] is likely to be 
appropriate for only a fraction of UC students, but 
even if only 5-10 percent of UC undergraduates 
graduate a quarter or semester early, it would free 
up 2,000 to 4,000 undergraduate slots per year and 
increase access to UC for other students coming 
in,” Vazquez said. 

The report also suggested increasing 
nonresident enrollment to increase geographic 
diversity and raise money. Additionally, it claimed 
that increasing nonresident enrollment generates 
money for the UC system since each out-of-state 
student pays $21,000 more for tuition a year than 
California residents.  

“California students would not be displaced 
for out-of-students; they would come on top 
of California students, not at the expense of 
California students,“ Vazquez said. 

The online classes pilot program will help 
and generate additional money for UC as well 
as provide students access to general education 
requirements that are becoming impacted due 

UC EXECUTIVES THREATEN TO SUE
EMPLOYEES DEMAND THE UC SYSTEM OFFER MORE 

PENSION BENEFITS. BY NISHA KURANI

Despite a “Vote No” campaign to 
protest inadequate pay and benefits, 
members of a union representing UC 
academic student employees approved 
a controversial labor agreement by a 
62-percent majority on Dec. 3.

A record 4,000 graduate students 
— out of the 12,000 members in the 
United Auto Workers Local 2865 who 
work as teaching assistants, readers 
and tutors — from the 10-campus UC 
system voted. 

At UCSD, 633 members voted to 
ratify the contract while 31 members 
did not. About 41 percent of the total 
UCSD members voted.

According to the union activist 
blog Labor Notes, this is the first time 
in the union’s history that any vote has 
been so contested. 

“I think it’s overall great for a union 
to have such high levels of participation 
[in] this highly democratic process,” 
UAW recording secretary David Selby 
said. “It’s that vote that makes the 
union very strong and healthy.”

The three-year labor contract 

— which took almost six months of 
negotiations to reach since bargaining 
began in June — will increase pay by a 
minimum of 2 percent annually, with 
additional 2-percent increases if the 
state budget recovers. 

Opponents of the agreement 
complained that the union bargaining 
committee could have pushed for 
a higher wage increase and larger 
childcare reimbursements.

“It’s good to have a contract — it’s 
always a plus,” UAW member and 
UCSD Communications graduate 
student John Armenta said. “There are 

workers on campus that work without 
a contract. I just wished we really put 
our feet down and demanded a better 
contract.”

UCOP spokespersons were 
unavailable for comment on the 
approved contract. The UC system’s 
chief negotiator for the contract, 
Peter Chester said in a November 
statement that the contract balanced 
the UC system’s fiscal crisis and union 
workers’ needs.

Researchers at the UCSD 
Department of Nanoengineering 
developed a new method to produce 
heart tissue and the surrounding 
blood vessels, allowing heart patients 
with scarred cardiac tissue to undergo 
transplants.

“Down the road you cannot wait 
for organ donation from someone,” 
Professor Shaochen Chen from the 
department of nanoengineering 
said.   “It takes time, and if you can 
make those tissues or organs, that 
could change the life of the patient. “

Chen and his research team 
received a $1.5 million grant from the 
National Institute of Health to create 
the tools necessary to generate tissue 
that mimics the human body in a 
natural environment starting from 
nanomaterials in the lab.

The process involves the use of 
nanomaterials to create a scaffold 
from which tissue can develop into a 
specific tissue. The scaffold eventually 

decomposes, leaving the artificial 
organ in its place. Chen’s research 
team focuses on precisely developing 
scaffolds with nanomaterials that 
allow cells to communicate with their 
environment and in the long run, 
develop therapeutic tools that can help 
cells grow into tissues and artificial 
organs.

Scaffolds are made of hydrogels 
— biopolymers that are biologically 
compatible with the human body — 
that allow transplants to occur without 
the danger of the body’s immune 
system rejecting the material. As the 
scaffold degrades, patients are left with 
their artificially engineered tissue. 
The scaffold can also contain tubes 
lined with cells that develop into fully 
functioning blood vessels. The lack of 
blood vessels in tissue regeneration can 
lead to tissue death.  

To create a scaffold, the starting 
nanomaterial is a polymer in the form 
of liquid. Using mirrors and a computer 
projections system that precisely maps 
out the three-dimensional shape the 
scaffold should assume, and as light 

shines through the solution, the 
liquid solidifies into the projected 
scaffold. Chen’s research also involves 
investigating the ways to obtain light 
with the correct wavelength to use to 
print “biological” materials.

“Our body has nano-scale 
processors around it, so we can sense, 
see, feel – so nanotechnology is perfect 
for that kind of purpose” said Chen.

His group is focuses on 
nanomaterials, and uses them for 
biomedical engineering devices.

“Currently we are doing some 
research for using it not only in cardio 
cells, it can be used in other cells (we 
could be speaking of creating kidney 
tissue), you start with kidney cells or 
stem cells and then put them in the 
scaffold to grow ” said Chen.

This system is extremely cost-
effective. The fabrication process 
involves a common computer projector 
and the polymer, which assumes the 
form projected by the projector. The 
total cost of production is around 
$1500, compared to the typical cost 
of an organ, varying from the average 

$60,000 for a kidney to, on average, 
$150,000 for a heart. 

The software is automatic, meaning 
that the user only has to load the design 
into the computer, click a button, wait 
three hours and the sample would be 
ready. 

“If someone – maybe myself or one 
of the students – is brave enough to 
start up a company – certainly they can 
do it, because the process is really cost 
effective,” Chen said.

to cuts in courses and increased 
enrollment. The pilot program 
— projected to start in 2012 and 
involving up to 25 courses — will run 
for a year to test its efficacy, according 
to Vazquez.

Co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty 
Association Wendy Brown said 
streamlining degrees and providing 
online courses would significantly 
decrease the quality of UC education. 

“If you just take those two 
[streamlined degrees and online 
education] in combination, you have 
an education significantly lower in 
quality, speeded up and [that] loses 
the dimension of a college education 

that’s about exploring new ideas [and] 
opening up new possibilities — and 
instead, is increasingly designed to 
crank out degrees and crank out job 
training,” Brown said.

O t her  cont ingenc y 
recommendations from the UC 
Commission on the Future not 
endorsed by the Regents include 
decreasing enrollment, reducing 
faculty and staff in addition to 
financial aid support. 

“These recommendations 
represent a worst-case scenario,” 
Vazquez said. “They would have to 
be considered only if the state budget 
worsens to that point.”

The Council of UC Faculty 

Associations President Robert Meister 
said the unendorsed recommendations 
should be considered now, not when 
financial situations worsen. 

“The news about the gold 
commission [report] is that most of 
the bad things Yudof wanted them 
to adopt [and] tried to push through 
were rejected at the Regents, so they 
kept them as contingency plans just 
in case is there is another emergency. 
How predictable is that there’s another 
emergency?” Meister said. “Jerry 
Brown has all but said he’s going to cut 
funding and increase taxes.”

reached what we believe is a fair 
agreement, and one that recognizes 
both the contributions our student 
employees make to UC’s teaching 
mission and the budgetary challenges 
we face,” Chester said.

In addition, the contract gives 
UAW members will receive increased 
health care coverage, a near-threefold 
increase in subsidies for child care 
(from $900 to $2,400 per year) and a 

partial remission to pay for costs of 
non-resident tuition.

The agreement also includes earlier 
job assignment notifications and 
increased role in negotiating health 
care benefits. Armenta said the child 
care subsidies provided do not reflect 
the real cost of child care.

“Raising a child in California is 
not cheap and the child care subsidy 
doesn’t cover it,” Armenta said.

In spite of the “Vote No” campaign, 

Selby  said the ratification was expected.
“I did only because we had 

vast majority of the people on the 
bargaining team who had voted on 
the contract,” Selby said. “With the 
gains we made and having no losses, I 
wasn’t surprised it was ratified because 
membership just understood that it’s a 
great contract.”

requirements for admission do not in-
clude a factor based on budget problems. 

“Students should be denied admis-
sion only for cause,” Hong said in a 
report. “Students have a property and 
contractual interest in having their ap-
plications considered under the 14 
published criteria, not the unpublished 
budget reduction factor.” 

He said $20 million is 0.1 percent of 

$19 billion, which was the total budget 
for the UC system last academic year.

“�e projected $20 million resulting 
from the decreased enrollment was ‘a 
tiny[,] tiny fraction of the total budget,’” 
the case report said.

According to the UC systems’s Bud-
get Plan to Direct the President to Cur-
tail Enrollments, the system currently 
services approximately 11,000 students 
for a cost of $121.8 million without ad-

ditional state funding. While this ac-
tion decreased enrollment of freshman 
entries, it also increased enrollment of 
transfers by 500 and kept graduate en-
rollment the same. 

Hong said he will not continue the 
case. “I will not appeal further,” Hong said. 
“�e chance to be reheard is very low.”

SHOULD UC EXECUTIVES SUE 
THE SYSTEM FOR PROMISED 
BENEFITS? VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes
√  No
√  I don’t know

There’s something delightful about going home for the holidays: My mom makes 
up for months of not pampering her 
“baby” by doing my laundry, buying 
me clothes, and, most importantly, 
cooking food that doesn’t resemble 
anything from Pho La Jolla. 

After the holiday, as I sat eating 
Ben and Jerry’s and watching “The 
Biggest Loser” — putting off finals 
studying for as long as possible — my 
jaw dropped when I saw one of the 
contestants, weighing in at whopping 
207 pounds, run a mile in seven min-
utes and 31 seconds, besting my high 
school record by a cool minute.

I was watching people twice my 
size running a marathon. And trust 
me, there’s nothing more motivating 
than watching slow-motion recaps of 
fat folds flapping in the L.A. breeze. 

I realized that if I wanted to survive 
the holidays without having to submit 
an application video to N.B.C. come 
January, I’d have to take action. 

After a little couch-side Googling, 
I came across the La Jolla half mara-
thon. 

This was it. All or nothing. I said 
goodbye to $60 and pledged to finish 
the half-marathon come April.

After a nine-hour drive, a $431 
speeding ticket and buying those 
Reeboks that are supposed to make 
your butt better, I was ready to hit the 
gym. 

It wasn’t my first walk in the park, 
but gym rats are still intimidating. The 
last thing I wanted to do was attempt a 
work out side-by-side with a meathead 
giving me a front-row seat to the gun 
show. Making a beeline for the tread-
mill, I figured a half mile warm-up 
couldn’t be a bad place to start.

Five minutes in, the supposed 
“comfortable jog” made me feel like a 
doughy, pathetic, out-of-shape fatty. 
Although those 13.1 miles were look-
ing less and less like probable, the 
stingy Asian in me wouldn’t allow 
myself to simply throw away $60, so I 
kept going.

Thirty seconds later, gasping for 
breath, arms flailing, I hit “stop.”

That was enough for one day.
I knew I had to make a plan if I 

was actually going to do this. I called 
my superstar marathon runner and 
asked for help. His advice: Hit the gym 
every other day, run two sets, with a 
cool-down in between, and tack on 
an additional .25 mile to my work out 
every day. Easy enough, right?

As obvious as it sounds, I found 
that it’s a lot easier to watch “Biggest 
Loser” contestants suffer from verbal 
harassment and gravity’s cruel reality 
from the couch than it is to follow suit.

Over the next few weeks, as I 
huffed and puffed on the treadmill, I 
stayed motivated by telling myself, “If 
they can do it, YOU can. Man up.”

It’s been three weeks since the first 
day at the gym, and though there were 
some days that even a visit from all 
the 6’4” blonds in the world wouldn’t 
have gotten me off my ass, I’ve been 
able to stick to my workout regime. 
Miraculously enough, through all the 
blood, sweat and mashed potatoes, I’m 
making it past the third mile — even 
though I’d still rather be watching the 
fatties do it for me.

QUICKTAKES

Discrimination, whether religious, racial, or sexual, isn’t tolerated in the United 
States — especially at a public institution. The 
University of Kentucky’s decision not to hire 
Martin Gaskell based on his religious beliefs — 
and a simple Google search that revealed he was 
using astronomy to prove the creationism of 
“Genesis” —  is appalling and antithetical to the 
United States Constitution. 

The university refused to hire him based on 
the claim that Gaskell is “evangelical.” Despite 
the fact that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
prevents employers from discriminating against 
hiring someone due to religious beliefs, the UK 
still holds that they’re in the green. According to 
the ruling in Barnes v. City of Cincinnati, as long 
as religion was one of the factors used in the 
decision not to hire Gaskell, the university is in 
violation of the law.

Christians — like any other religious group 
— shouldn’t be persecuted for their beliefs in a 
secular political arena. Professional interviews 
may be required by law to overlook matters of  
religious concern, but still, discrimination slips 
through.

The Constitution’s separation of church 
and state doesn’t mean that public universities 
should be sermonizing, but it also doesn’t mean 
that anyone who has ever been to church can’t 
work there.

Professor Rejected for Religious Beliefs

Though employers aren’t allowed to discriminate based on religion, there are valid concerns to 
factor into the hiring process when someone’s beliefs 
interfere with way he does his job.

In this case, the University of Kentucky had the 
right to deny Dr. Gaskell a job as an astronomer, as his 
evangelical beliefs contradict  widely accepted scientific 
theory and have compromised his teaching.

The university didn’t just suspect Gaskell of open 
endorsement of his faith; they had solid proof. In his 
previous lectures at the University of Texas — another 
public institution — Dr. Gaskell used astronomical 
theory to support the creationism aspect of “Genesis” 
and discussed what he felt were flaws in evolutionary 
theory.

Gaskell’s isn’t the first case of this kind.
Astrophysicist Guillermo Gonzalez was denied tenure 
at Iowa State University for supporting creationism. 
Gaskell’s case is even more clear-cut, since he not only 
endorses religious explanations for the scientific, but 
openly lectures on them.

Students pay thousands of dollars every year for 
their education; it’s the university’s duty to ensure that 
professors are qualified to teach. Hiring a professor that 
teaches ideas that are out of date is a great disservice to 
students. Research universities exist to advance think-
ing and challenge convention, not rehash religious 
dogma.

— Revathy Sampath-Kumar
Staff Writer

In the age of Facebook untagging, it’s no secret that Internet personas can hold drastic conse-
quences.

For astronomy professor Martin Gaskell, who 
posted his lecture notes online, it meant being 
disqualified from a coveted observatory job at the 
University of Kentucky due to his religious views. 

But while this may have put a damper on 
Gaskell’s career, the Internet  democratizes infor-
mation so that a more informed opinion can be 
made.

It’s for the best that today, you can to log on to 
social networking sites and discover your future 
roommate’s closet World of Warcraft obsession 
— and so too that a prospective employer can 
sign on to read Gaskell’s “Genesis” astronomy 
lectures.

We can’t condone religious discrimination, 
but the public property of the Internet can pro-
vides a way for people to make fair assessments 
and judgments. 

Transparency is never a bad thing, no matter 
the situation. With the knowledge that Gaskell’s 
religious views crossed over into his astronomy 
lectures in the past, the head of the observatory 
at the University of Kentucky was able to make 
a more educated decision on whether he was the 
right fit for the job after all.

CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
ARE MAKING A SMART DECISION BY 

DROPPING STUDENTS WHO HAVE RE-
PEATEDLY FAILED — BECAUSE SOME-

TIMES,  IN A STRAPPED ECONOMY,  
FAILURE ISN’T AN OPTION. 

BY ARIK BURAKOVSKY 

Facing a depleted budget and increasing enrollment, the California Community 
Colleges Chancellor’s Office has 
recently discussed the option 
of limiting the number of times 
community college students can 
retake classes they’ve failed.

Within the next several 
months, Chancellor Jack Scott 
hopes to present a proposal 
to the California Community 
Colleges Board of Governors that 
would eliminate state reimburse-
ment — funding independent 
of financial aid provided by the 
state government to partially 
cover tuition expenses — to 
community colleges for students 
who retake a course more than 
four times.  

This plan is a response to 
8-percent funding cuts for 
Californian community col-
leges during the 2009-10 aca-
demic year. On Nov. 18, 2010, 
Scott spoke to the California 
Community College League 
Conference, outlining “where 
we have been, where we are, and 
where we want to be.” Offering 
solutions to the state’s financial 

mess, he stressed two important 
goals of state community colleg-
es: saving money and boosting 
the success rates of students.

According to Vice Chancellor 
Terri Carbaugh, capping the 
number of times a student 
may repeat a course to four 
would save the state roughly 
$1.5 million annually and free 
up approximately 740 student 
seats in the 2.5-million student 
population at the state’s 112 two 
year institutions — but every 
bit counts. A four-time retake 
limit would give a fair number of 
hard-working students a better 
chance to enroll in courses cur-
rently filled by students retaking 
them.

Over 33,000 community 
college students in California 
have retaken at least one credit-
bearing course more than five 
times in the last academic year. 
The most-retaken courses were 
in physical education.

California community col-
leges have traditionally valued 
their common high-accessibility 
mission. This mission to serve 
all eligible students seeking

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the 

UC Irvine School of Law, doesn’t 
specify how much aid each University 
of California is provided by the state 
and how much is donated by alumni. 
Irvine Law opened Fall 2009 — offer-
ing free tuition to its inaugural class. 

The University of Southern 
California Law School, ranked by 
U.S. News & World Report at #18, was 
founded in 1896.  It will be some time 
before Irvine Law figures in that poll.

Still, there is no citizenship or 
residency requirement for admission 
to a law school, or to practice law, in 
California.  

Chemerinsky says he has had 
to negotiate salaries with recruits from 
Harvard, Northwestern, Yale and “as 
much as I enjoy living in Southern 
California, I could not have afforded 
to leave Duke University if it meant 
taking a substantial pay cut.” Duke’s 
precursor, Trinity College, moved to 
Durham in 1891, and the School of 
Law reopened with Justice A. C. Avery 
as its dean. No undergraduate work 
was required for admission to the two-
year LLB program.The Law School 
closed for financial reasons in 1894.

In 1904, James Buchanan Duke 
and Benjamin Newton Duke provided 
the endowment to reopen the School 
of Law.

It might save a great university to 
close Irvine Law — or iUC — until 
financial pressures pass.  According 
to U.S. News and World Report, the 
second- and third-ranked online law 
school programs scores are in the low 
80s and the low 70s, respectively. No 
school mentioned by Chemerinsky 
is located anywhere in the U.S. News  
part-time J.D. poll.

Christopher Edley, the dean of 

the UC Berkeley School of Law, 
attended a recent forum to defend his 
proposal to establish online degrees. 
Edley asserted that while online edu-
cation is not a substitute for on-cam-
pus instruction, it makes high-quality 
education more accessible. “The ambi-
tions that I have relate to building 
something to enable us to offer a UC 
quality of excellence to a population 
that simply can’t fit in the bricks and 
mortar campus we have today,” Edley 
said at the forum.

At UC Berkeley alone, 9,076 stu-
dents received $41.5 million in Pell 
Grant aid during the 2009-10 aca-
demic year. “In this tough economy, 
students need Pell Grants more than 
ever,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
said in a statement. “Congress is 
working on a solution which will 
hopefully provide most students with 
the maximum award.”

Feinstein can’t be trusted because 
her husband owns far too much for-
profit colleges’ stock.

According to Stanford University 
spokesperson Lisa Lapin, while the 
university offers a limited selection of 
online courses, online education has 
not been a priority. Officials from two 
more of UC Berkeley’s peer institu-
tions — Harvard College, and Yale 
University — also cited living and 
interacting on campus as essential to 
the college experience.

It Won’t Hurt Law 
Schools to Move Online

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

admission won’t be 
compromised by Scott’s 
proposal.

 Anyone who seeks 
enrollment at a two-year 
institution — whether 
to transfer to a four-year 
institution, graduate with 
an associate’s degree, 
or take remedial high-
school level classes — 
will still be welcomed.

But when it comes to 
cutting costs, some inevitably are 
left behind.

“Being the economy that it is, 

you’d like to be able to offer more 
to more people, but 
we just can’t, because 
we’re so dependent on 
the state for funding,” 
Mia McClellan, dean 
of student services at 
Southwestern College in 
Chula Vista, said.

Southwestern College 
in Chula Vista already 
has a rule that allows 
only two attempts at 
passing a course. The 

college is doing well today — with 
an enrollment of approximately 
19,000 students and around $13 

million in financial aid.
According to Carbaugh, a 

small number of students would 
be unable to fulfill certain course 
requirements. 

“As much as we’re here to pro-
vide access, we’re also here to serve 
those who desire to transfer or earn 
a degree,” Carbaugh said. 

If reforms like Scott’s can better 
serve those students without hurt-
ing everyday operations, state com-
munity colleges would be wise to 
pursue them.

When Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) voted against the D.R.E.A.M Act on Dec. 18, he said, “This bill is a law that 
at its fundamental core is a reward for illegal 
activity.” 

Had it passed, the Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors (D.R.E.A.M.) Act 
would have granted citizenship for individuals 
who were brought to the United States illegally 
as children and who either pursued higher 
education or served in the military, reward-
ing “talented young people who seek to serve 
a country they know as their own,” President 
Barack Obama said.

The act was still up for a vote when the 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) arrested Mark Farrales at his home is 
late November. As a result, the 31-year-old 
Harvard University alumnus and UCSD grad-
uate student was forced to halt work on his 
doctorate dissertation on corruption reform 
and spend five weeks in custody at Mira Loma 
Detention Center in Lancaster.

“I lost 25 pounds in five weeks, and when I 

came out I realized I had a lot more white hair 
than I remembered coming in with,” he said. 
“Your entire life is put on hold.”

Farrales came to the United States at age 
10 with his parents and three sisters from 
the Philippines on tourist visas in 1990 after 
his father, an outspoken politician who had 
recently announced a bid for Congress, was 
shot twice in the head by assumed hit men. 
The family went into hiding for a few weeks 
until the move, after which Farrales began 
sixth grade at a school in downtown Los 
Angeles.

“It was a pretty rough neighborhood, but 
learning English was not so difficult. I took to 
English pretty quickly,” he said.

Farrales excelled at school, eventually grad-
uating magna cum laude with a degree in 
government from Harvard in 2001. He cites 
his politically conscious upbringing for his 
choice of major.

“My father was a pretty outspoken person, 
especially against governmental corruption,

The culture gap between first-gener-ation kids and their immigrant par-ents has, for one Taiwanese-American 
alumna, gone public. 

No longer are the “unsolicited advice 
about everything from homosexuality to 
constipation” or the “passive-aggressive text 
messages ‘from the dog’” private affairs; 
thanks to Teresa Wu, who graduated from 
UCSD in 2010, the most “endearingly fobby” 
family moments are now available for mass 
consumption. 

Wu — together with her childhood friend 
and neighbor, Serena Wu — created a web-

site in October 2008 that chronicles, among 
other things, parental advice.

Between MyMomIsAFob.com and 
MyDadIsAFob.com, the guidance covers 
more than the familiar childhood idioms of 
“eat your vegetables,” “do your homework” 
and “call your mother.” 

“Get a cat. But don’t get an lazy American 
fatty cat. Get a hungry Chinese cat.”

“Be sure to wear lots of underwear, so if 
you get rape it’ll take them longer and you 
can escape.”

Or on how to best attract guys:
“Think when you little you chase a 

aquarel, the squarrel will run fast away. But 
if you stop, the squrel will dstop too, he may 

also peek on what you doing.
Do not scare the squarel.”

assignment and an Internet joke — some-
thing between friends that others of a similar 
background might identify with — took less 
than two months to become a viral phenom-
enon that, between the two sites, generates 
90,000 hits weekly. It also turned into a book 
deal; after being approached by publishers in 
November of 2009, Wu and Serena condensed 
their fan-generated content into My Mom is a 
Fob: Earnest Advice in Broken English from your 
Asian-American Mom. The book, featuring 
a foreword from Asian-American comedian 
Margaret Cho, will be released tomorrow, Jan. 
4. The cover is an user-submitted image of 
chopsticks resting in a half-eaten bowl of pop-
corn — which, according to Wu, is how the 
photographer’s mother eats the stuff.

The websites chronicle fan-submitted inci-
dences of parental worry, heightened by a 
language barrier (One contributor, who set his 
Google chat status to “food coma,” received 
this message: “Eric, I saw that you had a food 
coma? Are you okay? Please call back to make 
sure that you are okay.”), as well as dating advice 
(“What? You had a boyfriend? How old? Is he 
Chinese or Vietnamese? Did you meet him at 
a disco or casino? Don’t meet boys at discos or 
casinos, they only want one thing.”) and health 
warnings (“I think you are very pretty now. Just 
don’t get any fatter? I see you eating alot lately. 
Daddy little girl not so little anymore :)”).

According to Wu her inspiration for the 
website came from two major sources — her 
blog, where she posted snippets of her mother’s 
“fobby” moments to positive responses, and her 
classes at UCSD.

“I had a creative non-fiction class at UCSD, 
and I basically strung together little snippets of 
Skype chats, conversations and e-mails that my 
mom sent me, and I added a little commentary 
in between, and I turned it in as one of my cre-
ative non-fiction assignments,” Wu said. “And I 
got a great response from the class. And I think 
that kind of spurred on the whole thing.”

That’s when she called up her childhood 
friend and fellow first-generation American, 
Serena. The two had long been swapping stories 
of their experiences with Taiwanese parents.

“Teresa was like, ‘It would be really, really 
cute to make one for Asian moms,”’ Serena said. 
“So we got a bunch of submissions from our 

friends, and we pulled out stuff from our own 
moms, and we started a blog on Tumblr.”

When they started attracting hits, Serena 
and Wu moved the blog from Tumblr on to an 
independent host. A week after its conception, 
they added the mirror site MyDadIsAFob. 

“We split it up so that now,  I run 

MyDadIsAFob and [Wu] runs MyMomIsAFob,” 
Serena said.

According to Wu, the two websites have 
distinctly different tones.

“The brand of humor is kind of unique to 
dads and moms, in a weird way,” Wu said. “The 
kinds of things that moms say versus the kinds 
of things dads say — like, moms are always 
concerned about their daughters’ love lives and 
their daughters being fat … and then dads give 
really weird advice that’s really vague, and there 
are a lot of Chinese proverbs that don’t really 
make sense. You start to recognize patterns, I 
guess. Moms have a lot more grammatical and 
spelling errors that become really funny.”

Two months after the site launched, Wu and 
Serena were offered a book deal from Perigee 
Trade.

“A bunch of literary agents e-mailed us and 
we were like, ‘What? Is this a joke? What would 
literary agents want with this?’ And then more 
and more came … so I think we had about five 
literary agents e-mail us,” Serena said. “It actu-
ally took quite a long time to get a book deal, 
because for the first two months our agent was 
like, ‘No luck, no response.’ [But] it worked out. 
It was definitely nothing we expected.”

The word “fob” – an acronym for “fresh off 
the boat” – has long been used as derogatory 
term for recent immigrants who have not yet 
adapted to the cultural nuances of their new 

host country. But Wu argued that the site takes 
care to portray parents in an affectionate — if 
humorous — light. 

“We definitely didn’t expect [the site] to 
blow up the way it did,” Wu said. “We didn’t 
brainstorm, like, ‘What should we name this 
website?’ We thought about changing it — we 
genuinely thought about whether or not to 
change it because there are negative connota-
tions to the word ‘fob’, but by that time we were 
kind of like, ‘As long as we’re careful about how 
we use the term, and people aren’t getting the 
sense that we’re using it in a derogatory way, 
then I think we’ll be fine.’”

And although the women have received 
what Wu refers to as “respectful hate mail,” 
from viewers who disagree with their use of the 
term, the overall response has been positive.

“It was mostly like, ‘I don’t really like what 
you’re doing.’ I think people understand the 
intention behind our blog — we love our moms 
and we think they’re adorable,” Wu said. “It’s 
not like we think their English is atrocious and 
we want to poke fun at them.”

Plus, Wu added, the website offers a sense of 
solidarity to those who lacked the same sense of 
camaraderie that she and Serena had growing 
up with immigrant parents.

“For a lot of people who didn’t grow up 
around an Asian-American community, it’s 
really refreshing for them to stumble on 
something like this and find out that there 
are other people like this,” Wu said. “For me 
and Serena – we grew up in Fremont... our 
high school was 70 percent Asian. It was not 
weird at all to have really fobby parents. So it 
was something we always reveled in. So for 
people who didn’t grow up with that experi-
ence, I think it’s really nice to come across 
it and realize — and this is so cheesy — just 
realize that there are people just like them 
with parents just like theirs.”

Of course, comedy isn’t the only way the 
women make their living. Serena graduated 
from UC Berkeley in 2009, and works as a web-
site and iPhone game designer. After graduating 
with a B.A. in communications this year, Wu 
now has a job working with the Google Docs 
team in New York City.

“I was a communications major,” Wu said. “I 
was one of those people who did not know what 
they were going to do after graduation. I didn’t 

go into senior year thinking, ‘Oh, I’m definitely 
going to work at Google.’ I totally thought that I 
was just going to freelance after I graduated and 
just figure it out from there.”

But Wu is confident that their website will 
continue to grow.

“We do want to expand more and hopefully 
do merchandise, so that’s a 2011 goal,” Wu said. 
“I wouldn’t say that it’s an incredibly profitable 
venture — I’m not going to make a living off of 

it any time soon, at all. There’s no way. But it’s 
good side income.”

As far as the future of fob parents, Wu said 
that much depends on the fate of the book after 
its Jan. 4 release date.

“People always ask us about MyDadIsAFob.
com — so who knows? If My Mom is a Fob 
goes over really well, then maybe we’ll think 
about doing My Dad is a Fob, the book,” Wu 
said. “I actually think that the dad stories are 
almost funnier… [but] more people relate to 
MyMomIsAFob.”

Though traffic at MyMomIsAFob is decrea-
ing — instead of 10 submissions a day, they 
get roughly 10 submissions a week, according 
to Serena — new fobby moments continue to 
trickle in. And, as long as parents continue to 
confound their kids, those submissions will 
keep on coming.

INFOCUS CALIT2’S 10TH ANNIVERSARY

On Dec. 7, the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) gathered to cel-
ebrate its 10th anniversary. Calit2 has been a 
major player in merging the arts and sciences 
— developing innovative technology, bridging 
the gap between the virtual and the physical, 
and building partnerships with nationally rec-
ognized companies, such as Qualcomm and 
National geographic. 

Calit2 began in Atkinson Hall under 
Robert Conn, the dean of the Jacobs School 
of Engineering. The department’s research is 

focused around energy, environment, health 
and culture. According to Director Larry 
Smarr, Calit2 “represents a new mechanism to 
address large-scale societal issues by bringing 
together multidisciplinary teams of the best 
minds.” Recently, Calit2 has been grabbing 
headlines for the controversial Bible-research 
conducted by Thomas Levy in Jordon, and the 
search for the Leonardo Da Vinci mural — the 
Battle of Anghiari — headed up by Maurizio 
Seracini. 

The day’s festivities began at 10 a.m. and 
ran until 10:30 p.m, in conjunction with UC 

Irvine’s Calit2 program. Over 600 people 
attended the full-day event, including keynote 
speaker former California Governor Gray 
Davis, who is a major driving force behind the 
funding and overall success of the program, 
insisting that Calit2 receive all the funding 
from the state that it required. Other speak-
ers included neuroscientist Maryann Martone 
and Levy. Participants were also treated to live 
music performances, symposiums, a walk-
through the StarCAVE and a luncheon.

FOCUSÊ MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 2011Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

so I grew up in a household where politics and 
issues of governments were discussed almost 
on a daily basis,” he said. “I gravitated towards 
government.”

Farrales had always envisioned himself 
working in law, but after a brief stint at a public 
interests and civil rights law firm in California, 
he realized that he had neither the personality 
nor the desire to become a lawyer. He decided 
instead to pursue a Ph.D. in political science, 
joining UCSD’s political science program in 
Fall Quarter 2003 on the recommendation 
of Professor Lawrence Broz. Broz had taught 
Farrales at Harvard before moving to UCSD 
in 2001.

“Mark breezed through the curriculum 
with one of the highest GPAs I’ve ever seen,” 
said Broz. “The faculty knows him as an excel-
lent scholar and a gifted teacher.”

Though his primary focus has been studying 
the sources of political corruption in develop-
ing countries (with a focus on the Philippines), 
Farrales has also worked as a TA for the political 
science department, a job he loved.

After graduating from UCSD, and provided 
that he is allowed to remain in the country, 
Farrales is interested in becoming a professor. 
The latter is less than certain. 

In a vote on Dec. 18, the Senate came up 
five votes short of the 60 needed to advance 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act, which would have granted 
citizenship to those like Farrales who entered 
the U.S. before the age of 16 and who have 
been here for at least five years with a high 
school or college diploma or a GED.

The act was first introduced to congress in 
August of 2001, but saw no progress until Sen. 
Durbin (D-Ill.) pushed a vote in 2007, when 
the bill was filibustered by Republicans. In 
2009, the wording of the bill was changed to 
be more specific in terms of age and residency 
requirements, and it was passed by the House 
of Representatives in 2010, but failed when it 
was not passed by the Senate.

Farrales’s case is unique, both because his 
parents were seeking political asylum and 
because the battle to legalize his family stopped 
abruptly with his father’s death in 2006.

Leon Hazany, a Los Angeles immigration 
attorney who represents Farrales, has contact-
ed both California senators and congressman 
Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) in his work 
to get Farrales released from custody. Sherman 
asked ICE to allow the Board of Immigration 
Appeals more time to revisit the case, and 
bought Farrales one year without deportation. 

“We were unlucky, we got really bad advice 
from lawyers in the past,” said Farrales of his 
family and their situation. He will need all the 
legal talent to get through the red tape that 
remains.

“I’m far from being in the clear. There is 
going to be a long and arduous journey ahead, 
legally. We’re trying to get as much help as we 
can.”

Support for Farrales has erupted online 
since the publication on Dec. 19 of a Los 
Angeles Times article exposing his situation, 
including Facebook groups and blogs calling 
for solidarity and letters to congressmen and 
senators begging for Farrales’ release

David Selby, a graduate student in the UCSD 
political science department with Farrales and 
member of the Union for Academic Student 
Employment as well as the UAW, led a UCSD 
letter-writing campaign in support of Farrales. 
He collected over 100 letters to lawyers and 
politicians, and a petition written by another 
member of the ASE Union collected over 1,700 
signatures. 

“Overall, Mark is a great example of why 
we need comprehensive immigration reform,” 
Selby said. “This guy is an incredible person, he’s 
not technically a citizen, but he’s an American. 
To think about deporting him, it’s tragic, it’s 
ridiculous.”

Farrales was deeply moved to discover such 
a wealth of encouragement. “I see this — my 
release, which was unexpected — as a great 
chance for me to show, to myself and my family 
and my friends, to everyone that helped out, that 
I could be a protective member of society,” he 
said. “Its better for me to be out here and staying 
in the country. It’s almost like I have even more 
motivation to prove that I can give back.”

SPORTSÊ MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 2011Ê UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Humboldt’s Bryan Morris had a game-high 22 points as the 
Lumberjacks defended a slim lead in the final six minutes to 
hang on for the win. Christian Hatch had a team-high 16 points 
and Justin Brue had 13 points, eight rebounds and five blocks for 
the Tritons.

DEC. 30
UC San Diego 73, Sonoma State 64

Casey Ryan scored a career-high 28 points and added nine 
rebounds and five assists to lead to the Tritons to the win. 
Chrisitan Hatch and James McCann scored 19 and 16 points, 
respectively, for the Tritons.

WOMEN’S
DEC. 3

Cal State Monterey Bay 92, UC San Diego 91,  2OT
Triton center Lauren Freidenberg recorded a career-high 27 

points, but Monterey Bay pulled out the double overtime win 
with five players scoring in double figures. 

Chelsea Carlisle had a chance to win the game after she was 
fouled with two seconds left in regulation and her team down 
71-70, but the star guard could only make one of two free throws 
to force overtime. 

DEC. 4
San Francisco State 52, UC San Diego 66

Emily Osga led four Tritons in double figures with 14 points 
as UCSD picked up its first conference win. UCSD hasn’t lost to 
the Gators since 2003. 

DEC. 14
UC San Diego 61, Cal State East Bay 37

Chelsea Carlisle and Lauren Freidenberg had 12 points apiece, 
the Tritons got 23 points from their bench and UCSD routed 
East Bay thanks to an exceptional second half. The Tritons went 
on an 11-0 run with 3:55 left in the first half and never led by 
less than eight points for the rest of the game. 

DEC. 19
UC San Diego 88, Humboldt State 92, 2OT

UCSD lost in double overtime for the second time this season 
as the Lumberjacks continue to haunt the Tritons. UCSD led 
by as many as 13 points, but faltered down the stretch and the 
Tritons lost for the third consecutive time to the team that ended 
their postseason run last season. Chelsea Carlisle led all scorers 
with 29 points.

DEC. 30
UC San Diego 77, Sonoma State 55

Chelsea Carlisle once again led the way for the Tritons with 
a huge performance, tallying 31 points, five boards and seven 
assists. The Seawolves closed a 15-point Triton lead to 54-50 with 
7:28 remaining, but the Tritons closed out their last game of 2010 
on a dominating 23-5 run.

Honors: Jared Kakura 2010 
Daktronics NCAA Division II All-
America Second Team, CCAA Most 
Valuable Defensive Player, First Team 
All-CCAA; Shane Michiel Second 
Team All-CCAA; Jesse Brennan 
Second Team All-CCAA.

The men’s soccer team had a solid 
season, and remained in playoff conten-
tion until the penultimate weekend of the 
regular season. 

The squad got off to a slow start, 
going 0-4-2 in the first six matches. But 
the Tritons were able to pick themselves 
up and went undefeated in their next 
eight matches, picking up six wins during 
the streak. The run included a thrilling 
3-2 overtime victory over then-No. 14 
Chico State. Captain Jared Kakura scored 
his second goal of the game for the win-
ner, and the senior defender went on 
to be named the conference’s defensive 
MVP. 

The run came to a crashing halt with 
a pair of losses to Cal Poly Pomona and 
No. 6 Cal State San Bernardino, eliminat-
ing the Tritons from postseason conten-
tion. UCSD went out in style by beating 
its last two opponents by a combined 8-0, 
including a 6-0 win over Cal State East 
Bay on Senior Day. 

Overall, a poor start was overcome  to 
produce a respectable campaign, leading 
to a bittersweet season that, under differ-
ent circumstances, might have produced 
an elusive postseason bid.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL
Record: 19-9 overall, 15-7 in con-

ference (3rd in CCAA, lost in second 
round of NCAA tournament)

Honors: Roxy Brunsting AVCA 
Honorable Mention All-American, 
Daktronics Women’s Volleyball 
Honorable Mention All-American, First 
Team All-CCAA; Katie Condon First 
Team All-CCAA; Julia Freidenberg 
First Team All-CCAA.

Even with its season heading full-
steam toward disaster, the women’s vol-
leyball team was able to right the ship 
and make the playoffs. 

After winning their first two confer-
ence matches, the Tritons dropped five 
straight matches — four of them in the 
fifth set. 

The losing streak was the program’s 
longest since 1992, and caused the squad 
to drop out of the top 25 for the first 
time since 2001. The Tritons had a rash 
of injuries, and struggled to adjust to 
the system of first-year head coach Ricci 
Luyties. 

But the Tritons turned their fortunes 
around by winning 13 of their final 15 
matches, including an 11-match win-
ning streak. Roxy Brunsting — an All-
American at outside hitter in 2009 — saw 
time at setter, and her versatility allowed 
her to shine. While it was not as com-
fortable as they would have hoped, the 
Tritons made it into the NCAA tourna-
ment.

The Tritons swept Sonoma State in 
the first round of the tournament, but 
ran into No. 6 Cal State San Bernardino 
in the second round. CSUSB was the 
only squad to beat the Tritons twice in 
the regular season, and UCSD remained 
unable to find an answer for the Coyotes 
in the postseason, losing in three sets. 

In a roller coaster season, the Tritons 
did well to keep their composure and get 
into the postseason for the ninth time 
since the 2000 season. 

MEN’S WATER POLO
Record: 13-13 overall (4th at 

WWPA Championships)

Honors: Brian Donohoe First 
Team All-WWPA; Ryan Alldred 
Second Team All-WWPA, WWPA 
All-Tournament First Team; David 
Morton Second Team All-WWPA; 
Jakub Bednarek WWPA All-
Tournament Second Team.

The men’s water polo team had a 
rough 2010 campaign, finishing just 
fourth in the WWPA Championships. 

The SoCal tournament in early 
October was perhaps the highlight of 
the Tritons’ season, as UCSD was able 
to bounce back from a 22-12 drub-
bing at the hands of Stanford to take 
ninth place. The Tritons went 3-1 in the 
tournament, and beat Pepperdine and 
Loyola Marymount for the first time 
since 2006. 

But the Tritons could not beat a 
team ranked above them for the rest 
of the season, and the season ended 
with the program’s first-ever loss to 
Santa Clara in the WWPA tournament’s 
third-place match. LMU captured the 
WWPA title, and LMU and UCSD 
remain the only schools to capture the 
title since 2000.

CROSS COUNTRY
Men’s Record: 3rd at CCAA 

Championships, 8th at NCAA West 
Regionals

Women’s Record: 5th at CCAA 
Championships, 11th at NCAA West 
Regionals

Despite solid 2010 seasons, neither 
cross country team was able to qualify for 
the NCAA National Championships.

Senior Jesse Morrill was the con-
sistent leader on the men’s side, taking 
11th at the CCAA meet and 26th at the 
NCAA West Regionals. But young tal-
ent made up most of the Triton team, 
and freshmen Kellen Levy and Ryan Lok 
were each the top Triton finisher for at 
least one race during the season.

The women’s team was hurt by the 
transfer of ace Bre Schofield to Cal, 
but — as with the men’s side — younger 
runners stepped up to fill the gaps. With 
no seniors racing, the Tritons only slid 
down three spots to fifth following their 
2nd place finish in the 2009 CCAA 
Championships.

Overall, the Tritons gave themselves a 
strong base to build on with 13 of the 14 
runners that raced at regionals returning 
next year.

UCSD looked into the possibility of joining the Division I Big 
West Conference last month. The Big West, however, 
said thanks but no thanks to UCSD and Cal State 
Bakersfield, opting to bring only the University of 
Hawaii into its ranks.

The conference opened 
for expansion on Nov. 16 
by lifting its membership 
moratorium. Hawaii and 
Bakersfield filed formal 
applications to join the 
conference, but UCSD only 
expressed interest privately. 

“It was an assessment tool,” 
Athletic Director Earl Edwards 
said. “We wanted some feedback as to whether they were inter-
ested in us or not. Obviously, they were more interested in 
Hawaii than they were in us.”

When Big West Council — a group of leaders from each 
member school — met on Dec. 7, CSUB and UCSD were not 
recommended by the Council and consequently the Board of 
Directors did not vote on their invitations. The board voted 

unanimously to extend 
an invitation to Hawaii, 
who accepted several 
days later and will join 
officially in 2012.

The Big West is a 
non-football Division 
I conference, including 
the likes of UC Santa 
Barbara, UC Irvine and 
UC Davis. Hawaii will 
compete in the Mountain 

West Conference for football and Big West in all other sports, 
and becomes the conference’s first non-California based member 
since 2005. Hawaii will also pay around 20 percent of the travel 
costs for the other schools in the conference when playing in 
Honolulu. 

“We are excited and pleased with the addition of Hawaii to 
the Big West Conference,” chair of the board of directors and 
UC Irvine Chancellor Michael Drake said in a press release. 
“In assessing Hawaii, the board carefully considered and was 
impressed by both its legacy of athletic success and its commit-
ment to academic excellence.”

Hawaii decided to leave the struggling Western Athletic 
Conference, joining Boise State, Nevada and Fresno State in 
moving to the Mountain West. The WAC will be left with 
just four of its current members beyond 2012: San Jose State, 
University of Idaho, New Mexico State and Louisiana Tech. 

Edwards emphasized that UCSD only expressed interest 
in the Big West, and did not make any official commitments 
toward joining the conference or Div-I.

“It’s important to make that distinction,” Edwards said. “Once 
the university is able to decide what we are going to do, then we 
can go ahead and file an official application to a conference.”

UCSD commissioned a Div-I feasibility report that will be 
released in mid-January.

BIG WEST TO UCSD: 

“NOT NOW, THANK YOU”

“WE WANTED SOME FEEDBACK AS TO 
WHETHER THEY WERE INTERESTED 
IN US OR NOT. OBVIOUSLY, THEY 
WERE MORE INTERESTED IN HAWAII 
THAN THEY WERE IN US.”

ÑATHLETICS DIRECTOR EARL EDWARDS

UCSD — along with Cal State Bakersfield — looks into joining 
Division I Big West, but conference is only interested in Hawaii

FALL

REVIEW

TOURNAMENT RUN FOR WOMEN’S SOCCER 
HIGHLIGHTED AN EVENTFUL FALL SEASON FOR 

UCSD ATHLETICS.

BY LIAM ROSE * SPORTS EDITOR

WOMEN’S SOCCER
Record: 19-3-3, 12-2-2 in confer-

ence (2nd in CCAA South Division, 
lost to Grand Valley State in Division 
II National Championship Match)

Honors: NCAA Division II 
Runner-Up, Lisa Bradley NSCAA/
Performance Subaru Division II 
All-America First Team, Daktronics 
NCAA Division II All-America Third 
Team, First Team All-CCAA; Kristin 
Armstrong NSCAA/Performance 
Subaru Division II All-America Second 
Team, First Team All-CCAA; Annette 
Ilg CCAA Newcomer of the Year; 
Annie Wethe First Team All-CCAA; 
Sarah McTigue Second Team All-
CCAA; Shelby Wong Second Team 
All-CCAA.

The women’s soccer team made 
an electrifying run to the NCAA 
Championship game, but was felled 
by defending champion Grand Valley 
State.

A young team in 2009, the Tritons 
returned all of their starters with an 
important addition. Annette Ilg, a for-
mer all-conference guard on UCSD’s 
basketball team, came out for soccer 
for the first time since high school 
and immediately turned herself into 

a goal-scoring threat. Ilg scored two 
goals in her first college match, and 
finished the season with a team-high 
11 goals.

The Tritons suffered a slow start 
with upset losses to Cal State L.A. and 
Humboldt State, but the squad went 
unbeaten for the next 13 matches. 
UCSD lost in penalty kicks in the 
conference tournament, but received 
an invitation to the NCAA tourna-
ment regardless. 

The Tritons were underdogs 
throughout their tournament run, but 
ran over higher-ranked Seattle Pacific, 
St. Edward’s and Saint Rose without 
allowing a goal. In the national title 
match, Grand Valley State proved it 
was still the team to beat, becoming 
the first team to repeat as national 
champs since the Tritons did it in 
2000 and 2001. 

The Tritons had one of their 
best seasons in years, and the future 
remains bright: all but two players 
will return in 2011.

MEN’S SOCCER
Record: 8-6-4 overall, 8-5-3 in 

conference (3rd in CCAA South 
Division, missed playoffs)

The women’s soccer team returned to the NCAA Division II National Championship match for the first time since 2001.

Senior guard Casey Ryan is second on the team 
with 11.8 points per game through 10 games.
