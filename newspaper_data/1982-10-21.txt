Propositioning California 
Inequities 
within state 
ballot laws 

By CANOLE 
Staff Writer 

The people of California 
h a v e t w o m e t h o d s for 
legislating growth and change 
in our state. The first is to elect 
officials who wil l represent 
their interests through the 
enacting of laws, and the 
second is to vote on public-ally 
petitioned propositions. The 
common requirement for both 
elected officials and petitioned 
propositions is that they 
r e p r e s e n t a s i g n i f i c a n t 
number of California citizens. 
Proposit ions, for example, 
require a minimum of 346,119 
signatures to be placed on the 
ballot. 

Since an official may be 
elected bv a wide or narrow 
margin, during either a high or 
! n w v o t e r t u r n o u t , the 
p r o p o s i t i o n s y s t e m w a s 
established to provide for a 
more complete representation 
lor the people. This is a 
balance of power that can be 
used by the general public 
when the officials, the people 
elected, are nol fully able to 
fulfi l l the public's interests. 

In theory, the needs of the 
m a n y c a n n o t be t o t a l l y 
controlled by the desires of the 
few. This balancing system, 
however, applies only to the 
p e t i t i o n i n g process for a 
proposition. Before there is a 
vote either "yes" or " n o " on a 
proposition, it goes through a 
long and convoluted process, 
for within the legality of the 
sys tem is a method for 
upsetting its balance. 

To generate a public change 
in the California government, 
the first requirement is a 
minimum of 346,119 volun-
tary signat ures, and t hey must 
be gathered in person. Each 
and every signature is verified 
by the board of registration to 
make sure t he signer meet s t he 
r e q u i r e m e n t of b e i n g a 
California resident.

VS. Senate candidate Jerry 
Brown reiterated his support for 
increased aid to education and 
proposed eliminating the MX 
missile system at a special press 
c o n f e r e n c e for S o u t h e r n 
California student media held 
last Sunday. 

BrcMn admitted production of 
the controversial missile here 
would provide more jobs in 
California, but said the weapons 
system could still be eliminated 
without hurting the state's 
economy. 

"Remember, we want to 
e x p a n d N A S A ( N a t i o n a l 
A e r o n a u t i c s a n d S p a c e 
Administration I here, and we've 
got the Bullet Train to provide 
jobs," Brown said. "I don't think 
jobs alone are a significant 
justification (for keeping the 
missile)." 

The governor also suggested 
reducing ground forces in 
Europe through negotiations 
w i t h the Soviet Union to cut 
President Reagan's five-year 
$1.5 trillion defense buildup. 
After the press conference at the 
Bur bank Airport. B H M T I said 
that other unspecified weapons 
syst ems could also be el lminat ed. 

B n w n said that while the 
Minuteman ICBM force should 
not be retired, he would support 
discussions with the Soviets on 
those land-based svstc 
''Everything's negotiable." he 
added. 

In contrast to recent camjHign 
appearances, Brown concen-
trated an outlining his plans fora 
h igh -1echn oli>gy econ omy 
instead of launching attacks on 
his opponent. San Diego mayor 
Vte Wilson. 

The governor mentioned the 
Republican during the hour-long 
press conference only when he 
criticized Wilson's support of 
R e a g a n o m i c s a n d a s k e d 
s t u d e n t r e p o r t e r s t h e i r 
opinion of Wilson's television 
advertisements. 

"We're all in a mutual search 
for tnith here." he joked when 
one reporter said that Brown 
should only answer questions, 
not ask them. 

Brown also accused Wilson oi 
Graying from his support of 
Reaganomics when Wilson 
charged BrtAvn with hiding a SI 
billion state deficit dunnga Santa

Benjamin's new "Year" 
noted actor Richard Benjamin has given 
directing a try, and comes up with a hit film. 

By CLYDENE NEE 
My Favorite Year is welt on its 
way to becoming a hit with 
movie audiences across the 
country. This engaging 
comedy owes much of its 
success to the blend of a funny 
story, tatented actors and a 
new and gifted director in 
Hichard Benjamin. Benjamin 
has done an impressive job 
with this film that marks his 
directorial debut, he is better 
known for is role in front of the 
cameras as an actor in such 
films as Catch 22, Westworld, 
and Love at first Bite. Recently 
Hiatus writer Clydene Plee 
talked with Benjamin about 
directing, working with Peter 
OToole and the state of 
television. 

Hiatus: Why did you want to 

become a director? 
Benjamin: I've always wanted 
to direct, but the acting career 
got started first. I studied acting 
and directing at Northwestern 
University, after I graduated I 
couldn't find a job as a ditector. 
It is hard to tell someone I am a 
director,' they say, Sure, what 
have you done? It is impossible 
to get work. 

Hiatus: how did you get the 
job as director f this film? 
B e n j a m i n : I d i r e c t e d a 
television pilot three years ago 
called Where's Popa. Michael 
Gruskoff, the producer of the 
film, liked what I had done with 
the show and wanted me to 
direct My Favorite Year. He told 
Mel Brooks who he wanted, Mel 
said, great then get him.' The 
people at MGM said what has he 

done, so Michael showed him 
what I had done so I was 
considered. You don't consider 
directing, they consider you. 
There are people around here 
that wear T-shirts that say on the 
back, What I really want to do 
is direct.' There are so few 
pictures being made, it's like a 
joke, there are very few chances 
that someone has to direct. 
Hiatus: Robert Redford and 
yourself have made impressive 
directorial debuts, how do you 
feel this wi l l affect other actors 
who might want to enter the 
field as a director? 
B e n j a m i n : Directors come 
from almost every part of the t 
industry. You can be a writer, an 
editor, or an actor to understand 
directing, what you need is a 
chance to prove it. 

Hiatus: How do you feel your 
experience as an actor reflects 
in your work as a director? 
B e n j a m i n : ft is h e l p f u l , 
because the one thing you don t 
know is what it is like to stand 
there and do an emotional 
scene, then have someone come 
and tell you to do it differently, 
and then turn around to do the 
scene over again. It helps you 
understand the twists and turns 
of being an actor. Being an actor 
you understand the acting 
process, and that helped me as a 
diretor. 

H ia tus : What was unique 
about Mark Linn-Baker that 
made you choose him for the 
role of Benjy? 
Benjamin: First of all I knew 
that I wanted an unknown actor 
for the part. The problem was 
where to get someone, and if 
they were young enough for the 
part they might be too 
inexperienced for the role. They 
also might not be able to keep 
up with Peter O'Toole. I sent the 
script to several agents in Mew 
York and they all sent back the 
same name, Mark linn-Baker. I 
saw him in a play and thought 

Rookie director Richard Benjamin discusses a scene with veteran 
actor Peter O'toole during filming of the new film "My Favorite Year" 

that he was great, then I gave 
him a screen test and he was 
wonderful, so he got the part. 
Hiatus: How did you feel about 
directing Peter O'Toole? 
B e n j a m i n : It was a real 
experience because you are 
dealing with an international 
treasure. You have to take care, 
this man has a marvelous career 
and you don t want to damage 
it, or put him in a bad light. The 
first few days of shooting we 
were very polite and formal. 
After a while we talked like 
people do to each other. It was 
an incredible thing to wrok with 
a great actor, he was great all 
the time in every scene, and 
highly professional. 

Hiatus: Did you ever know 
anyone l ike Alan Swann 
(O'Toole s character in the 
film)? 
B e n j a m i n : They are an 
endangered species as the fi lm 
tries to bring out. There are not 
many of them left. We don't 
have the same Errol Flynn type 
of actors today. Flynn was an 
actor that was like the way he 
lived in real life. He was born in 
Tasmania and was a smuggler at 
an early age. 

Hiatus: Is there something 
about the film that no one has 

really covered that you would 
like to talk about? 
Benjamin: When the film first 
came out someone wrote that 
l ive te lev i s ion p roduced 
authentically mad people and 
authentic human beings. I am 
not sure that today they would 
get their own shows. Television 
is bland, all the plots and 
characters are bland, now if you 
want someone to think a line is 
funny you add a laugh track. The 
originals of television relly 
wanted to get the laughts. The 
only thing like that now would 
have been the original cast of 
Saturday Plight Live. 

Hiatus: What are we going to 
see Richard Benjamin doing 
next? 
Benjamin: Right now I am 
looking for a good script. A 
good script is everything then 
comes the actors. There are so 
many bad movies being made 
and there are so many bad 
scripts out there. Today movies 
are being made because people 
are locked into the system and 
they are turning out the bad 
scripts and movies. I have a 
movie coming up on CBS that I 
worked on with my wife Paula 
Prentiss called Packn It and it 
should air in November.

Letters to the Editor 

Intercol legiate A t h l e t i c s is 
r e c e i v i n g suf f i c ient funds 

Prop 15 rebuttal 

E d i t o r : 
I a m writing in response to a 

paragraph in the October 21st 
edition under the Running 
Thoughts column. In noting 
the state of Intercollegiate 
A t h l e t i c s I believe some 
inaccurate statements were 
made. The art icle stated 
"Intercollegiate Athletics here 
at U C S D a s k e d f o r a 
s u b s t a n t i a l i n c r e a s e i n 
coaches' salaries this past 
year. According to Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet, they 
needed $144,000. They asked 
for $106,000, and incredibly, 
they received only $38,000. 
T h i s administrat ion is a 
farce." Has the administration 
screwed us over once again? I 
think not. However, I W Q U W 
like to clear up some of these 
facts: 

1. T h i s increase of $106,000 
w a s not r e q u e s t e d i n 
I n t e r c o l l e g i a t e A t h l e t i c s ' 
annual budget last year. It was 

brought to the Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Affairs last 
spring and is under considera-
tion from the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee now. 

2. T h e $38,000 Intercolle-
giate Athletics received last 
year is part of their permanent 
budget. It is a set amount that 
they receive every year. By-
asking for an increase of 
$106,000, they would br ing 
their budget up to a total of 
$144,000. the desired amount. 

In other words, Intercolle-
giate Athletics is not receiving 
any less then they have had in 
the past. They are requesting 
at this time that an increase be 
given from the Registration 
Fees for an increase in 
coaches' salaries. The money 
has been neither denied nor 
granted as of yet. I think it is 
important that these points be 
clarified for students. 

T h e Vice Chancellor has 
(appropriately) asked that this 

matter be studied by the Reg 
Fee C o m m i t t e e and a 
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n on t h e 
subject be submitted. It is the 
Committee's job to look at 
q u e s t i o n s s u c h as how 
important is Intercollegiate 
Athletics to students and is it 
worth $144,000 (that sum 
would include salaries only) 
when compared w i t h other 
student services that must 
also be funded through Reg 
Fees? 

As a student and a Reg Fee 
member who must voteonthis 
issue, I would be interested in 
other students' responses. I 
know how the athletes feel, 
but what about the non-
a t h l e t e s ? W o u l d you be 
interested in seeing another 
$98,000-106,000 go toward 
paying Intercollegiate coaches 
or do you see other areas of 
student service which have 
higher student priorities? 

please turn to page 15 

Ed i to r : 
Your Monday issue brought 

with it an attack on Prop. 15 by 
Michael Krupnak. While I 
support Prop. 15, I am not 
wri t ing to beat the drum for it, 
but to address some of the 
ridiculous assertions brought 
up in M r . Krupnak's letter. 

First of all, he asserts that' 
violence is a product of our 
f a s t - p a c e d s o c i e t y a n d 
intensely pressured lifestyle. 
This may be true, but one 
must not forget that theuseof 
a handgun in a crime or 
murder is often an outlet for 
this so-called violence, just as 
eating an apple is a way to 
satisfy hunger, to use his 
analogy. Handguns may not be 
the cause of violence, but thev 
are certainly an instrument of 
violence and should not be 
readily available to one and al l . 

Also, by Michael 's way of 
thinking, he supports Prop. 15 
He clearly states that no 
criminal is going to rush out 
and register his gun. That is 
the point. Prop. 15 insures that 
anyone caught wi th or using 
an unregistered handgun in a 
crime or for whatever reason. 

Wete looking for people 
who dort think straight. 

If you've always looked for what's around the 
corner rather than what is straight ahead, consider 
a career with Linkabit. 

Linkabit didn't get to where it is today by way 
of tunnel vision. We're a leader in the design, 
development and manufacture of satellite and 
terrestrial communications equipment, specializing 
in local communication networks, encryption, 
forward error correction and high speed 
modulation. Our people are very creative, free 
thinking individuals who look beyond obvious 
solutions to find advanced, innovative ways to 
meet the demanding needs of this industry. 

To help keep new ideas flowing, we've made 
sure that all career paths are flexible. O u r 
engineers, for instance, are assigned to projects 
detiending on their interests and abilities. As one 
assignment is completed, new Opportunities are 
made available in a variety of areas. 

Because our projects are very diverse and 
complex, we utilize the most advanced equipment 
available. And our staff is comprised of 

professionals with a wide range of expertise. 
Our company is expanding rapidly, and we're 

constantly looking for talented people interested in 
communications systems, digital hardware or

w i l l be given a mandatory 
prison sentence. 

A s for the mat ter of 
protection, the incidence of a 
robber or thief being stopped 
by an angry citizen wi th a 
handgun is extremely rare. 
Since carrying a concealed 
handgun down the street or a 
loaded handgun in a car is 
illegal, handguns are relegated 
to protection in the home. 
Certa inly there are more 
effective weapons than a 
handgun to fend off, k i l l or 
detain a criminal . How about a 
shotgun? A shotgun doesn't 
require great accuracy, as does 
a handgun, and is probably 
cheaper and easier to obtain 
than a handgun. 

M r . Krupnak also states 
that "according to Prop. 15, no 
new guns wil l be sold in 
Cal i fornia . " Prop. 15 states 
that no new handguns w i l l be 
sold . A gun store w i l l , 
however, be able to sell every 
other type of gun and every 
type of ammunition, as well as 
pre-owned, registered hand-
guns. Guns of all other types 
w i l l continue to be readily 
a v a i l a b l e to t h e e n t i r e 
Imputation, rich or poor. While 
Prop. 15 wi l l not make it 
impossible to get a new 
handgun, it w i l l certainly 
make it much more difficult. 

F u r t h e r m o r e , I w o u l d 
certainly like to know where it 
is written that "our fathers 
a n d g r a n d f a t h e r s w e r e 
assured that the ownership of 
handguns would be their right 
forever." 

Finally, and perhaps most 
importantly, is M r . Krupnak's 
outrageous and of fens ive 
comparison of Prop. 15 to 
" l a w s instigated by Adolf 
Hitler and Fidel Castro." T h i s 
comparison is so stupid that I 
do not see how it can be made. 
Both Hitler and Castro were 
dictators, inst igat ing laws 
whenever they felt the desire 
to do so. Proposition 15 is a 
mandate by a free people 
concerned about their own 
safety, as well as the safety of 
others.

Edi to r : 

Several supermarkets have 
begun displaying signs and 
print ing their paper bags 
stating " W h y punish everyone 
for the bad manners of a few," 
with the intended meaning 
that this would be t he result if 
the beverage container deposit 
ini t iat ive passes. On the 
contrary, this is already the 
case — we are all "punished" 
by litter s a i l i n g the aesthetic 
appeal of public land, by 
broken glass endangering feet 
and tires, and by higher taxes 
to pay for the cleanup of 
streets and parks. Indeed, the 
effect of passage of the 
measure would reduce the 
amount of punishment of 
everyone due to the bad 
manners of a few, despite the 
efforts and money of the out-
of-s tate bot t le rs to say 
otherwise. It is particularly 
annoying to be forced to carry 
the idiot logic of the txil tiers on 
every bag of groceries we 
carry.

C a l i f o r n i a g u b e r n a t o r i a l

and George Deukmejian (R)

crime and the state budget 
d u r i n g their f inal debate, 
sponsored by the League of 
Women Voters Tuesday night 
at the Old Globe Theater in 
San Diego. 

With a week to to before the 
November 2 election, Los 
Angeles Mayor T o m Bradley 
expressed concern that the 
"Cali fornia dream I was able 
to enjoy is now beginning to 
c r a c k , " b l a m i n g " t h e 
Sacramento crowd" of which 
he said Deukmejian was a 
part. 

" Y o u ' r e p a r t of t h e 
p r o b l e m , " he t o l d the 
California Attorney General in 
front of a television audience 
across the state. 

Deukmejian countered that 
"the Sacramento crowd, as he 
(Bradley) refers to it, is the 
leadership of his (Bradley's) 
own party. These are all the 
people that have gotten us into 
this s i tuation." He added that 
Bradley's running mate, Wil ly 
B r o w n , was part of the 
" c r o w d . " 

Support ing Reaganomics, 
Deukmejian argued that both 
interest rates and inflation 
have dropped sharply . He 
added that Reagan's tax cut 
has put money back in the 
w o r k e r s ' p o c k e t . T h e 
Republican said that "the real 
income of the average person 
in the United States today has 
increased. . . " 

Bradley stated." There are 
1.3 million Californians out of 
work. We can't wait for the 
national economy to turn 
around." 

C r i t i c i z i n g D e u k m e j i a n ' s

first-time

Progres • : he works for 

Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley (1) and Attorney General George Deukmejian (r) pose for 
the press before their debate last Tuesday. The two gubernatorial candidates later sparred 
heavily on law enforcement and California's economy. 

George? Not one," adding, "I 
have created 200,000 jobs in 
Los Angeles in the past nine 
years." 

The G O P candidate blamed 
" t h e ant i -growth business 
climate created over the last 
eight years by people in 
S a c r a m e n t o , " for l e a v i n g 
people out of work. Unem 
p l o y m e n t i n C a l i f o r n i a , 
according to Deukmejian, is 
partly due to "the regulatory 
mania in Sacramento," which 
he says would be cut if he is 
elected. 

Deukmejian, appearing the 
more aggressive of the two, 
blasted Bradley's record of 
crime fighting. 

"Cr ime has gone up in Los 
Angeles at a much greater rate 
I ban the rest of t he state." said 
D e u k m e j i a n , c i t i n g F B I 
statistics for the first half of 
1982. 

W h i l e m u r d e r s in Los 
Angeles increased 80 percent, 
along with a 105 percent rise in 
r o b b e r i e s , t h e A t t o r n e y 

General said Bradley's answer 
was to cut t he size of t he police 
department by six hundred 
officers." 

Deukmejian proudly stated 
that four former Los Angeles 
police chiefs have endorsed his 
c a n d i d a c y a l o n g w i t h 
organizations representing a 
total of 58,000 California peace 
officers. 

Shot back Bradley, a 20 year 
L . A . P . D . veteran, " C r i m e is up 
in Los Angeles? You can do 
a n y t h i n g you want w i t h 
figures. You have been the 
chief law enforcement officer 
in this state for four years and 
you should bear some of the 
blame." 

"What have you done about 
i t . " asked the mayor, claiming 
that while there was a sixty-
nine percent increase of crimes 
in Los Angeles during his 
administration, there Was a 
seventy percent increase state-
wide. 

Q u e s t i o n i n g B r a d l e y ' s 
firmness as- a law enforcer. 

Deukmejian, the author of 
Cal i fornia ' s death penalty 
said. "I think he sti l l has not 
made it clear whether he 
supports capital punishment 
or the death penalty or not." 

Bradley responded that " . . 
it is and w i l l be the law. I wi l l 

enforce all l aws . " But later 
added that he would not sign a 
death penalty bill if it came to 
him as governor. 

After the debate, Bradley-
told reporters that he "would 
not move to make the death 
penalty unconstitutional." 

Addressing the state budget, 
Bradley reported that "he 
w o u l d not h e s i t a t e " to 
increase taxes. He said, "I am 
not going to lie to the people of 
the state that we are going to 
make up one billion dollars, if 
(the deficit) is that amount.''

(ABET) . 

T h e e v a l u a t i o n t e a m , 
comprised of engineer ing 
experts from several universi-
ties and institutions of higher 
learning across the country, 
visited U C S D Monday and 
T u e s d a y for an o n - s i t e 
inspection of the programs 
offered through the A M E S 
department. 

T h i s inspection is one part 
of the evaluation procedure to 
determine the department's 
readiness to be accredited by 
A B E T . This is the first time 
the A M E S department has 
sought accreditation for its 
programs. 

The written portion of the 
evaluation, w h i c h outlined the

programs a n d U n i v e r s i t y 
policies concerning them, was 
submit ted to A B E T last

B r o w n ' s c o n f e r e n c e 
continued from page 1 
Monica Rotary luncheon last 
week. 

"It's pure speculation of what 
he thinks the state economy will 
be," Brown said of Wilson's 
prediction. "It's his indictment 
of Reaganomics." 

In addition to supporting 
more aid to education. Brown 
noted that such aid is necessary 
to improve student performance 
in a time when foreign students 
are pushing native Californians 
out of some university programs. 

Estimating that forty percent 
of engineering students at UCLA 
are foreigners. Brown said that 
California students are being 
forced to compete with students 
from all over the world. 'That's 
not a bad thing as long as 
everyone that has the talent has 
the opportunity to advance their 
skills,' he added. "But many 
(California) students are not 
getting in." 

By increasing teachers' salaries 
and the number of graduate 
student fellowships, as well as 
raising basic educational 
requirements in secondary 
schools, Brown said California 
students will be better equipped 
to compete against foreign 
students for admission to state 
colleges and universities. 

"I support the opportunity of 
California students to get an 
education, and not with these 
artificially high requirements 
(for admission to college)," 
Brown said. "I say expand, not 
exclude." 

Brown praised UC's micro-
electronic scholarship program, 
which awards stipends to 
graduates conducting research in 
that field, along with computer 
research at the Berkeley campus 
and the state investment in 
People Project, which funds 
high-technology job training at 
the high school, junior college 

and university levels, as ways to 
improve both education and the 
economy. 

Brown also proposed 
increased funding for the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency, the National Science 
Foundation and the National 
Istitute of Health as ways to free 
money for research and 
scholarships. He also proposed 
increasing taxes but said, "I don't 
think you tan ask peoplewhoare 
losing their jobs for more taxes." 

Brown hinted that tax 
increases would not be necessary 
if the economy recovers from 
the current recession, adding 
that Reagan's economic pro-
gram is preventing an upturn. 

'The Federal program is put 
Uigether with chewing gum and 
paper clips and it's about to fall 
apart," he said, adding that 
Wilson will support Reagan-
backed budget cutting measures 
in the Senate, harming the 

economy by cutting out new 
research and scholarship 
programs. 

"What we're facing now is the 
Wilson promise of cutting the 
civilian budget," he said. 'That 
means across-the-board cuts, 
that means colleges. Universities 
will suffer the slings and arrows 
of budget cuts." 

Brown proposed establishinga 
"more generous" monetary 
policy, tightening tax loopholes 
and deferring the last portion of 
the Reagan tax cuts. "Some-
thing's got to give," he said. 'If 
either the $750 billion in tax 
cuts, either the $1.5 trillion 
military buildup, or something 
else — or you (the students) or 
the high schools." 

Reporters also questioned 
Brown on his proposal for a 
national version of the California 
Conservation Corps. Unlike 
Republican congressman Pete 
McCloskey's proposal for a 
mandatory/youth service 
program, Brown said his 
suggestion calls for only-
voluntary service in the 

community. 
"Financially, it's not in the 

cards (for a mandatory 
program)," Brown said. "I 
would like to see a five-year 
voluntary program built up, then 
when you have a hundred 
thousand people in it, you exceed 
its potential." 

Brown also said he did not see 
a need for a peace-time draft, and 
called legislation prohibiting 
non-registrants from receiving 
financial aid or joining job 
pr<|jrarns "double jeopardy." 
'The criminal sanctions (for not 
registering) is a rather strong 
penalty already," he said. 

Brown also met with 
representatives of the student 
press for Northern California in 
San FranciscoSundiy afternoon. 
Both press conferences were 
arranged by UCLA student Lisa 
Piercey, who is a memlxT of the 
Brown for Senate staff.

interest on that proposition, 
thus the petition is represen-
ting only the interest of people 
of our state. To give examples 
of how many people became 
i n v o l v e d in t h i s y e a r ' s 
petitions, the gun control 
initiative (Prop. 15) received 
435,441 signatures, the bottle 
recycling initiative (Prop. 11) 
450,707, and the nuclear freeze 
initiative gathered a near-
record 595,682 signatures. 

Once a proposition qualifies 
for the ballot the "campaign 
w a r s " begin and the strict 
regulations end. When a 
person, company or organiza-
t i o n w a n t s to c o n d u c t 
promotions either " for" or 
"against" a proposition they 
must comply w i t h these rules: 

1. If you donate more than 
$500 you must establish a 
c o m m i t t e e , r e g i s t e r a 
committee name wi th the Fair 
Political Practice Commission, 
and appoint a treasurer for 
your committee. 

2. If you mail out more than 
200 advertisements, you must 
print your committee's name 
on the outside of the envelope. 

T h e s e are t h e s i m p l e 
p r o m o ' i o n a l r e g u l a t i o n s , 
seemingly out of balance when 
weighed against the strict 
regulations of the petition 
procedure. T h e Cal i forn ia 
Registrar of Voters provided 
e v e n m o r e i n t e r e s t i n g 
information. 

There is no limit to the 
amount of money that can be 
donated to a campaign. To give 
an idea of what amounts of 
money are involved, the eight 
most expensive campaigns 
previous to this year are: 
A n t i - s m o k i n g 

1978 — $7.1 million 
R e n t C o n t r o l 

1980 - $6.8 million 
Cal i f . C a n a l 

1982 - $6.2 million 
W i n d f a l l O i l P r o f i t s 

1980 - $6.1 million 
State Income T a x 

1980 - $5.4 million 

N u c l e a r P l a n t Sites 
1976 - $5.3 million 
A source at the California 

State Department on Elect ions 
commented that the slogan of 
the committees opposing the 
Gun Control initiative is " W e 
have our sights set on being 
the most expensive campaign 
in California 's history." 

Indeed they will be, for 
between the G u n Control and 
the B o t t l i n g R e c y c l i n g 
opponents a total of $13.5 
mill ion has been spent so far. 
To give you an idea what t hese 
totals indicate, dividing the 
total money spent by the 
number of petitioners wou ld 
have each signature offset bv 
$153. 

There is no limitation on 
how much a single individual 
may donate. T h e office of F a i r 
Political Practices stated that, 
in theory, a single individual 
could create an advertisement 
campaign to offset the efforts 
of 346,119 petitioners, for 
purely personal reasons. 

A d o n a t i n g person o r 
company does not have to be a 
resident of California. In fact 
the donor need not even be a 
citizen of the United States. 
This opens the door to any 
special interest group to step 
in and negate the efforts of 
C a l i f o r n i a res idents . T h e 
donating committee need only 
register the name of their 
treasurer and there is no 
requirement for donors to 
disclose who they are. T h i s 
again is in direct contrast to 
the petitioning regulations of 
r e q u i r i n g v e r i f i c a t i o n of 
names as true residents. 

T h e donating committee can 
choose to call themselves by 
any name as long as the name 
is not presently being used by 
another committee. In effect, 
they might ca l l themselves 
"Californians for a Better 
Cal i fornia" w'thout actually 
being Californians. 

There are presently laws 
requiring those who change 
their names or form a business 

to publish, in a newspaper, 
who they are and the intent of 
their new name or business. 
This law was established to 
p r o t e c t the p u b l i c f r o m 
persons or groups who would 
hide behind a false name to 
disguise their special interests 
and act ions. There are no such 
l a w s f o r p r o m o t i o n a l 
committees. 

Although the process of 
propositions was formed to 
give a voice to a consolidated 
group of Californians, their 
efforts can easily be drowned 
out b y t h e a m p l i f i e d 

a d v e r t i s i n g c a m p a i g n s 
s u p p o r t e d by i n t e r e s t e d 
parties, regardless of who they 
are, where they come from, or 
what their interest is in 
California's government. 

A s one officer from the 
Voters Registration Board 
ironically pointed out, "We are 
caught in a Catch-22. We 
would have to proposition for a 
proposition reform. Such an 
action would draw a new all 
time record in millions of 
dollars to be spent in fighting 
any reforms of promotional 
campaigns. 

T h i s use of campaign power 
is not one s i d e d . T h e 
proponents of the 1978 Jarvis-
G a n n P r o p e r t y T a x C u t 
( P r o p o s i t i o n 13) found it 
advantageous to invest 4.3
