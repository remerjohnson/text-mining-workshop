IN THE THICK OF IT

(From left to right) UCSD students Hannah Flaig, Zhichen Zhang and Dronneil Chandra take part in an Army Reserve Officer Training Corps field 
training exercise completed at Camp Elliot on Friday, Nov. 22. UCSD cadets who participated learned key survival techniques and tactical combat skills.

The UCSD Jacobs School of 
Engineering won Popular Science 
Magazine’s “Best of What’s New” 
awards for 2013 for its innovative 
outdoor shaker table and a robot 
called SkySweeper, designed to 
move along utility lines.

UCSD boasts the largest high-
performance outdoor shake table in 
the world, which allows structural 
engineers to test buildings, improve 
earthquake hazard mitigation and 
protect structures.

“It can subject a 400-ton payload 
to 1.2 Gs, the high-end of recorded 
seismic movement,” the report in 
the Popular Science Magazine said.

The world’s largest shaker table is 
25 ft. by 40 ft. and was tested against 
a fully equipped five-story building.

Structural engineers at UCSD 
Englekirk Structural Engineering 
Center in Scripps Ranch created 
a five-story building — which 
included an ICU, surgery room, 
piping and air conditioning, fire 
barriers and a functional elevator 
— and tested it against a series 
of recorded magnitude of real 
earthquakes. 

The building was tested with 
some of the world’s greatest earth-
shaking quakes, including the 
8.8-magnitude Chilean earthquake 
of 2010. The $5 million project aims 
to determine how to keep high-
value buildings such as hospital 
and data centers operational even 
through massive earthquakes.

“What we are doing is the 
equivalent of giving a building an 
EKG to see how it performs after an 
earthquake and a post-earthquake 
fire,” principal investigator Tara

Applications Open for
New Transfer Guarantee

ADMISSIONS

Low-income San Diego-area community college 
students can now gain assured admission to UCSD.

BY  Gabri ella Fleisch man  staff  writer
University of California administrators 

launched a new program this week that will 
give low-income students in San Diego a 
guaranteed transfer to UCSD. The new project, 
UniversityLink, was launched Nov. 20 and will 
replace the Transfer Admission Guarantee 
(TAG) program that was discontinued in 2012. 
UniversityLink aims at assisting low-income 
community college students from the San Diego 

area who cannot attend any UC campus other 
than UCSD because they cannot afford to live 
away from home.

To be eligible for the program, a student’s 
family income cannot exceed $40,000 a year. 
Additionally, students must have at least a 3.5 
average grade point average, and they must fulfill

BRIEFS by  aleksandra konstantinovic     staff  writer    
▶  Meningitis

A third case of meningitis has been 
confirmed at UC Santa Barbara, following 
two other diagnoses this month. The latest 
patient is female, while the other two are male.

The Los Angeles Times reports that over 
300 UCSB students may have come in contact 
with the infected students.

Meningitis is a highly contagious disease 
frequently identified by a stiff neck, headaches 
and a high fever. College students are 
particularly susceptible to the disease that 
spreads through close living quarters and 
shared utensils. 

Santa Barbara’s Public Health Department 
will be conducting tests to determine if 
anyone else is sick.

▶ Mayor Race
San Diego’s special election on Nov. 

19 resulted in a runoff, with none of the 
candidates receiving a majority of the vote.

Republican City Councilmember Kevin 
Faulconer received 42.73 percent of the 
vote, while his Democratic rival and fellow 
Councilmember, David Alvarez, received 26.5 
percent of the vote. Former assemblyman 

and UCSD political science professor Nathan 
Fletcher fell behind Alvarez with 24.24 
percent and announced his retirement from 
public life in a concession speech a day after 
the election.

A map of voter turnout from the San 
Diego Union-Tribune shows a primarily 
Republican turnout in northern parts of San 
Diego, including La Jolla, with a Democratic 
majority in southern areas.

The runoff is not yet scheduled but will 
likely be in February of next year.

▶ Trolley
The San Diego Association of Governments 

has approved a plan to build a trolley route 
from the Old Town station near Fashion 
Valley up to UTC and La Jolla. The project 
has been under consideration for six months.

The new light rail will stop by nine stations, 
including two on the UCSD campus. One 
planned location is by Pepper Canyon in Sixth 
College, while the other is on east campus, by 
Triton Ballpark and Scripps Hospital.

The project will be funded by federal 
money and tax revenue and is scheduled to 
open by 2018.

Hutchinson said to UCSD News.
While the shaker table tests the 

land, the SkySweeper makes its sky-
high rounds across utility cables.  

“Developed by engineers at 
the University of California at San 
Diego, it will be the most affordable 
and versatile power-line monitoring 
tool,” said Popular Science 
Magazine.

SkySweeper is a V-shaped robot 
with a motor-driven “elbow” at its 
center. It is equipped with clamps 

that open and close, allowing the 
robot to move in an inchworm-
like fashion. The clamps that act 
as its hands can also swing over 
and release one at a time, allowing 
the robot to bypass cable support 
points.

Developed by Thomas Bewley, 
professor of mechanical engineering 
at UCSD School of Engineering, and 
Ph.D. student Nick Morozovsky, the 
SkySweeper is both low-cost and 
efficient. Made with just off-the-
shelf electronics and plastic parts 
printed from a 3D printer, the 

prototype for the SkySweeper is less 
than $1,000 — far less expensive 
than the current models used to 
inspect utility lines.

“The revolutions in low-cost 
microcontrollers and 3D printers 
have enabled rapid prototyping of 
complex robotic systems, such as 
SkySweeper, that can take novel 
dynamics and control problems 
from simulation to reality,” 
Morozovsky said to UCSD News.

regular transfer requirements.
Students must also go to one 

of nine local partner community 
colleges: Cuyamaca, Grossmont, 
Imperial Valley, MiraCosta, Palomar, 
San Diego City, San Diego Mesa, San 
Diego Miramar or Southwestern.

The TAG program is still in effect 
for the fall of 2014 but will no longer 
be in effect for UCSD after that year. 
However, it is still operating for eight 
other UC campuses. 

Interim Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Alan Houston said 
that an estimated 200 students will 
be eligible for the program each year 
and that there is no ceiling for the 
number of students that can take 
advantage of it.

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Robby Boparai 
noted at Wednesday night’s A.S. 

Meeting that these students are 
unique from other commuter 
students and may require additional 
support once they attend UCSD. 

“We don’t yet have a support 
system to deal with those issues,” 
Houston said. “Once they get here, 
the trick would be to figure out what 
kind of community ties are missing.” 

However, Houston guesses that 
many of the primary issues facing 
these students are likely to be similar 
to the issues facing other commuter 
students. 

“If I had to wager a guess,” 
Houston said, “I’d say the biggest 
challenge for the commuting student 
is parking.”

A potential financial problem 
that this program may cause is 
that many of these incoming 
students will require large sums of 
financial aid. However, according 
to Houston, Chancellor Pradeep 

Khosla’s “primary objective in 
the capital campaign that will be 
launched next year is scholarships 
for undergraduate students.”

Aditionally, UniversityLink 
established a four-week summer 
Medical Science Program. The 
program is free of charge and 
includes academic activities, room 
and board. The program is intended 
for students interested in medicine, 
dentistry, pharmacy, biomedical 
research or allied health careers. 

Student veterans, active-duty 
service members and former foster 
youth are also eligible, regardless 
of their year. International students 
are not eligible. High school seniors 
and community college students can 
apply for UniversityLink starting 
Nov. 20.

Around 200 Students will be Eligible for UniversityLink Yearly

Don’t Let 
Familiarity 
Breed  
Contempt

An unusually frigid November morning and my own dubiously grace-
ful antics recently conspired to 
sideline me for the better part of 
a week. After my lazy attempt to 
exit my bed ended up in a pain-
fully strained back, I laid around 
in a dolorous stupor and promised 
myself to be grateful for every day 
my body worked normally. Yet the 
moment my back returned to its 
untroubled state, I forgot all about 
it again.

I can take some comfort in the 
fact that such apathy is not entirely 
my fault. My indifference to the 
comforts I’m used to is an example 
of a behavioral mechanism called 
latent inhibition, first discovered 
in 1959 by R.E. Lubow and A.U. 
Moore. Our brains take the massive 
amount of sensory input we receive 
on a continual basis and automati-
cally filter out all the stuff that we 
have already processed and deemed 
irrelevant. We rapidly grow accus-
tomed to various persistent envi-
ronmental stimuli and tune them 
out, so that our brains don’t have 
to struggle with handling multiple 
sensations at once.

This ability conferred a survival 
advantage; when our homo erectus 
ancestors were skulking about in 
the bushes stalking prey, it was 
helpful not to have been distracted 
by the minute perceptions of hover-
ing insects or poky dirt underfoot. 
Further down the evolutionary 
timeline, we also find latent inhibi-
tion useful. If we have a particu-
larly smelly roommate, it’s helpful 
if we’re able to block out the odors 
after a while. And when we’re tak-
ing an exam, we don’t want to con-
stantly feel our sleeves tickling our 
arms; our body focuses accordingly 
on the task at hand and desensitizes 
us to all the other inconsequential 
ambient sensations.

Unfortunately, this typically 
helpful ability can be a bit problem-
atic when we start ignoring things 
wholesale. Latent inhibition is a 
notorious saboteur of human rela-
tionships — when we get used to 
the presence and kindness of those 
close to us, we take them for grant-
ed, despite their qualities. As most 
of us have experienced at one point 
or another, we’re apt to get bored 
and end up seeking new people.

Similarly, we’re bound to over-
look the things in life that we are 
fortunate to have. I was overjoyed 
and overcome with gratitude when 
I got my laptop for my birthday 
four years ago, but it rarely elicits 
the faintest thought anymore as to 
how privileged I am to have it. If it 
were to get lost, I would be heart-
broken. But until then, it usually 
falls out of my consciousness. The 
same goes for every comfort and 
privilege we enjoy that others don’t 
— it’s only when they’ve disap-
peared that it might strike us how 
lucky we are.

It’s rather impossible to be 
perpetually thankful when our 
possessions, physical and intan-
gible, number in the hundreds. 
We’re hardly going to profess our 
appreciation of shoelaces or phone 
chargers. But we can still keep our 
most valuable possessions close to 
our hearts. Trust me — I’ve had the 
same lovably faded grey teddy bear 
for 19 years.

QUICK  TAKES AS HIT SHOWS “HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER” AND “BREAKING BAD” COME TO AN END, TELEVISION NETWORKS CBS AND AMC HAVE ORDERED PILOT EPISODES FOR SPIN-OFFS FOR BOTH SERIES.

The U.S. Armed Forces’ plan to 
integrate women into special 

operations units is a much-needed 
shift toward true gender equality in 

the miltary.

ILLUSTRATION  by  elizabeth  wang

Television spinoffs are the epitome of hit-or-
miss. Network executives face the question of 
whether their new show will be a novel crowd 
pleaser or if it will be a lame attempt at recreating 
the past. But spinoffs do more than greedily reap 
profits out of show concepts; reworked episodes 
move on with the themes and atmosphere fans 
come to love, rejuvenating them with new charac-
ters that will develop in their own way. 

Preserving these shows is much more than 
instilling the character dynamic of Marshall 
Eriksen or Walter White into new bodies and 
faces. New characters can appeal to the same 
audience without being a complete reproduction 
of their parent personas. The show is able to live 
on by using the same world and struggles from 
before, evoking a sort of nostalgia in the fans.

One spinoff series that successfully moved on 
with themes and settings is Nickelodeon’s “The 
Legend of Korra.” Stemming off of the world 
developed in “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” this 
series develops brand-new characters — com-
plete opposites from the original show. It’s the 
same world viewed from a different perspective, 
and that’s what made this series successful. “The 
Legend of Korra” averaged 3.7 million views for 
its first season, up from 3.2 million for “The Last 
Airbender,” prompting the Nickelodeon network 
to order three more seasons on top of the first one.

Efforts in developing these derivative series 
aren’t just so companies can wring out the remain-
ing life out of an idea. It’s a combination of opti-
mism and fan support that spurs the need to con-
tinue with themes that audiences will surely love.

Television Networks Utilize Spin-offs 
as Easy, Low Risk Investments

Ill-Fated and Unpopular TV Spin-offs 
Show Executives’ Lack of  Creativity

Familiar Themes and Characters 
Successfully Draw Audiences In

Continuing every hit show past its prime is 
ultimately an unsustainable practice that bars new 
shows from finding new audiences. Series spinoffs 
tend to cling to old successes and milk them for all 
they are worth, coasting on viewer nostalgia to pro-
long characters and storylines until they’re no longer 
interesting or believable. However, network execu-
tives should look for what worked in past hits and 
translate these aspects into new shows.

Networks have become too hesitant to introduce 
new premises, and instead rely on worn-out charac-
ters from old, stale shows far past their peak. When 
the CW Network introduced “The Carrie Diaries” 
as a prequel for the “Sex and the City” franchise 
that ran for six seasons and two movies, even Sarah 
Jessica Parker — the series’ lead actress — was 
unimpressed and believed the series was odd.

A continuation of a show or character only occa-
sionally finds its own voice and earns a loyal follow-
ing. “Cheers” sequel “Frasier” matched the original 
show’s longevity with an 11-season run, while 
1970s hit “Happy Days,” a spinoff itself from “Love, 
American Style,” spawned semi-popular spinoffs, 
“Mork & Mindy” and “Laverne & Shirley.” However, 
spinoffs that attempt to bask in former glory without 
offering anything new, end up wrung dry of profits, 
while audiences become jaded and grow to loathe 
the characters they once tuned in for.

Networks need to realize that a show does 
not warrant a spinoff solely on the basis of a suc-
cessful run. After nine seasons of “How I Met 
Your Mother,” no one really wants to see “How I 
Met Your Father.” We’d like to see a story about 
somebody new.

Networks will always milk a cash cow. Once 
media moguls spot a show with unrealized money-
making potential, a spinoff can mean the difference 
between cult obscurity and blockbuster franchise. 
Spinoffs to declining or ended shows serve as easy, 
low-risk ways to squeeze a bit more money from a 
once-popular series, or even catapult the series into 
the great wealth and fame of franchisedom.

Because spin-offs come with a built-in audi-
ence, the pre-existing fanbase saves on marketing 
and takes pressure off writers to develop new 
characters. Even if a spinoff fails, its large initial 
viewership makes commercial space an easy sell. 
Although “Joey,” the infamous spinoff of “Friends,” 
suffered cancellation after its second season with a 
low of 4.1 million viewers, it attracted 18.6 million 
viewers for its premiere season.

On the other hand, a successful franchise can 
churn out profits for generations, on and off TV. 
“Looney Tunes” still makes $1 billion annually off 
its merchandising empire built from its decades of 
retooled spinoffs. The original “Star Trek” ended 
after just three seasons. However, a total of five spi-
noffs spanning four decades made Star Trek the $4 
billion franchise recognizable today, with its most 
recent films grossing $250 million each. “Law & 
Order” has spawned ten spinoffs and foreign adap-
tations; producers found a formula for profitable 
television and stuck with it.

Love them or hate them, spinoffs make busi-
ness sense. They not only build off untapped hype 
from the parent show to keep the cash flowing, but 
also occasionally create franchise titans that rule 
the entertainment industry for decades to come.

Sixty-five years have passed since the approval of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act, permit-ting women to seek permanent status in the mili-
tary. Now, as of Jan. 21, the United States Armed Forces 
will make moves toward integrating women into elite 
positions in special forces divisions of the military such as 
the Navy SEALS, the Army Rangers, or the Green Berets 
to begin as early as 2015.

Given the rapid advances in women’s rights within the 
last 50 years, full integration of women into the military 
will serve as one of the final steps on the path towards 
much needed occupational equality for women, but also 
as a first move towards achieving genuine gender equality 
in the military.

Although there are questions regarding the number of 
women who will be able to meet the physical demands, 
such capacity seems to be a minute concern for some 
military officials. Former SEAL officer Cade Courtley 
agrees that there are women with the physical and psy-
chological prowess for the job, but questions the wisdom 
of adding “an element into the most elite special forces 
that could cause it to be less effective.” Female physical 
competence, then, seems to fall somewhere at the bot-
tom of a list of concerns, trumped by reluctance toward 
change. However, skepticism is no cause for refusal of 

equal opportunity.
In a nation where gender roles are an implicit and 

explicit part of the culture, breaking down the meta-
physical barrier between male and female seems absurd, 
but only because we have been branded with gender 
stereotypes straight from the get-go. American culture 
has focused more on gender differences than on similari-
ties, nurturing gender stereotypes from the moment a 
newborn leaves the hospital with either a blue or a pink 
blanket. Karen Davis, professor of neuroscience at the 
University of Toronto, asserts that typical views of women 
in combat have “been strongly influenced by socio-cultur-
al perspectives flowing from an exclusively male-oriented 
warrior framework or at least the assumptions underlying 
it.” A link rather than a barrier between genders would 
allow for less unnecessary divergence. Although such 
unspoken laws are now being challenged, the idea of 
gender equality in the military is still fresh with the deep-
set existence of gender roles in our country, which ulti-
mately serve as a crucial factor to women being viewed as 
incompetent or unfit for comb standards. 

Unfortunately, it took something as serious as sexual 
assault to ignite the process of change. Chairman of the

Thinking Caps



Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin E. 
Dempsey shed light in January on 
the reasoning behind the decision, 
stating that the continuous problem 
of sexual harassment in the military 
may be due to an imbalanced posi-
tion dynamic, declaring: “When you 
have one part of the population that 
is designated as warriors and another 
part that’s designated as something 
else, [the] disparity begins to estab-
lish a psychology that in some cases 
led to that environment.”

This rationality is valid, but 
nothing new. The infamous prison 
experiment conducted at Stanford 
University in 1971 by psychol-
ogy professor Philip Zimbardo, 

in which 24 men were placed in 
a simulated prison environment, 
shows the adverse effects of bestow-
ing power to a select group of 
individuals that would otherwise 
be considered equals. The planned 
two-week experiment was brought 
to a screeching premature halt due 
to horrific behavior inflicted by the 
group of men labeled guards on to 
those labeled prisoners. Zimbardo 
concluded that it was the situation 
— not the individuals themselves — 
that caused the behavior. Although 
Gen. Dempsey’s logic of power 
dynamics is sound, the integration 
of females into these elite positions 
should not be as a result of maltreat-
ment. Rather, permitting women to 
contend for these spots should be a 

means to restructuring the gender 
paradigm toward equality.

The transition to full integra-
tion may be slow at first and the step 
seemingly small, but it is the last 
step toward women becoming fully 
included in the military, which is a 
significant accomplishment for our 
country. Future daughters will no lon-
ger be notified that they do not have 
the option of becoming a Navy SEAL 
or an Army Ranger, and as females 
grow into the field of Special Forces, 
both men and women will learn to 
adapt accordingly, taking a step for-
ward toward equality rather than a fall 
backward to segregation.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I have been an employee of 

UCSD for 12 years. But as a dis-
abled employee, I no longer feel safe 
at work. I disclosed my disability 
to my department with the hope of 
getting the support I need to over-
come the difficulties I have at work. 
I provided two letters from my 
doctor identifying the functional 
limitations that would enable me to 
continue working.

The University Interactive 
Process has failed. The doctors’ 
letters I provided and three meet-
ings held on this issue have failed 
to ensure that the accommodations 
I need to function at work are met 
in a way that is consistent and fair. 
Instead the accommodation has 
been provided only sporadically and 
begrudgingly — thereby ensuring 
continued stress, difficulty and ulti-
mately failure to meet the require-
ments of my job. 

During a Disability Interactive 
Process meeting convened by the 
department, I was subjected to 
derogatory comments about my 
illness. These comments under-
mined trust going forward, as they 
indicate a troubling pattern in the 

department and perhaps through-
out the system. 

It is important to note the sig-
nificance of a functional limitation 
and its attendant accommodation: 
A disabled employee cannot func-
tion without the accommodation in 
place. The employer has the power 
to enable the disabled employee 
to succeed by providing a minor 
adjustment — or to ensure their 
failure by withholding the specified 
accommodation. In this case it is 
not only my ability to work, which 
is at stake, but the success of the 
course and its students. 

I believe an open discussion 
about disability in the workplace is 
in order. A culture of discrimina-
tion should not be allowed to per-
petuate within a public institution. I 
believe in the UC system and hope 
to send my son to school here. But 
by ignoring these troubling signs 
the very values of the University 
of California are compromised. 
The majority of Americans WILL, 
at some point in their lives, live 
with disability. As our society ages, 
accommodating disability in a way 
that is consistent and reasonable 
will help ensure the success of the 
institution and our society.

Muir College freshman Lily Wang has been an artist since she could pick up a pencil. Literally. As a child, when learning how to write the alphabet, even her 
letters would look like pictures.

Eighteen years later, the pen is still at work. The fruits 
of her labor hang in The Loft until December: 10 vibrant 
paintings that appear to be so professional that students have 
even emailed Wang asking if she sells books of her work. 
This makes sense considering her work is also featured in 
Cannon Tunnel in the Capitol Building in Washington D.C., 
the prize for winning the 26th Congressional District Art 
Contest.

The 10 pieces on display include a mix of digital and 
traditional pieces that she made during high school. There 
is visible diversity in her works, ranging from somber and 
intense drawings to blindingly fluorescent ones. 

Wang’s goal for her art is simple.
“When people see my work, I want them to feel some-

thing or get some sort of idea from seeing my work,” Wang 
said. “I want to communicate feelings between me and the 
viewer.”

Each painting also holds personal meaning for Wang.
“Each piece, when I look back at [a painting], I remember 

what I was feeling at the time,” Wang said. “It’s kind of like 
looking at photos from the past. [I’d think], ‘That’s how I 
looked then. That’s how I drew then. Oh, I looked so gross 
back then, or oh, I was having fun.’”

 Wang’s personal favorite on display is “Pour Love,” a

It’s no secret that one of the most 
stressful aspects about the holiday 
season is figuring out the perfect 
gift to give to your loved ones, but 
Giftovus — an online, collabora-
tive gift-giving service — allows 
gift givers to work together to find 
the perfect gift. According to www.
Giftovus.com, a person will struggle 
finding gifts for six out of 10 people 
that they shop for, and in the end, 
gifts are still dissatisfactory 20 per-
cent of the time. A simple collabora-
tion between the gift giver and the 
family and friends of the receiver 
will make special occasions less hec-
tic and less costly.

Giftovus was launched last 
month by UCSD alumna Jessica 
Jessup, who got help from fellow 
UCSD alumni husband Brian Jessup, 
Tim Schilling and Andy Sammons.

“[My mom is] really hard to shop 
for, [so my sister and I] were just 
online, emailing each other back 
and forth trying to figure out the 
right gift,” Jessica Jessup said. “That 
was just taking a really long time, 
so that’s where we came up with the 
idea of creating Giftovus — to try to 
help myself, as well as a lot of other 
people, [with the process].”

Giftovus is formatted similarly to 
Facebook, and users connect through 
Facebook so that family members 
and friends can “recruit” one another 
to contribute to the effort. First, a 
user posts a wish list on his or her 
Giftovus profile. Then, friends and 
family collaborate on the user’s pro-

file by posting different ideas on the 
receiver’s profile and work toward 
making the gifts more personal. For 
example, if someone lists “sweater” 
on his wish list, his loved ones can 
discuss different styles, colors and 
brands that he might want, allowing 
for a more personalized, thought-
out gift. Throughout this whole pro-
cess, the receiver will not be able to 
see the activity on his or her profile 
other than the wish list that he or she 
has posted. 

Giftovus also serves as a money 
saver since Jessica Jessup says peo-
ple end up spending more money 
to overcompensate when they’re 
unsure about a gift.

“People often think, ‘If I don’t 
know exactly what to get, then I’d 
rather overshoot in money than 
undershoot,’” she said. “People think 
that spending more equates to car-
ing more, but that is not true.”

According to Giftovus, the aver-
age American spends about 18 
hours struggling to think of a per-
fect gift and wastes $102 each holi-
day season. 

“The expression, ‘It’s the thought 
that counts,’ falls perfectly with what 
we’re trying to do,” Jessica Jessup 
said. “[With Giftovus], you’re think-
ing about someone, putting in the 
effort to learn more about them 
and trying to figure out a way to 
express your relationship in the gift 
that you’re giving to them. What we 
don’t agree with is someone saying, 
‘It’s the money that counts.’”

Jessica Jessup believes that 
Giftovus makes gift giving a learn-
ing experience.

“In that process of bringing peo-

ple together [and] throwing around 
a few ideas, you also learn about 
[the receiver],” Jessica Jessup said.

When a Giftovus user makes a 
list of gifts he wants, his or her loved 
ones can narrow down their search 
for the perfect present while not 
completely ruining the surprise.

“He wants a bike, and his loved 
ones can help him figure out what 
size he is, what style he likes, what 
color he’d want,” Jessica Jessup said. 

Jessica Jessup explained how col-
lege students in particular could 
benefit from the platform.

“In college, you live on cam-
pus, and you have a lot of friends,” 
she said. “[You can] get everyone 
involved in [it], and get everyone 
posting about each other. You know 
a lot of little things, and college stu-
dents can help the parents and other 
friends know what to get.”

Giftovus allows its users to select 

gifts that receivers are more likely to 
appreciate. 

“To put it succinctly, the right 
gift costs less,” Brian Jessup said. “If 
it’s something they’re really going to 
love, it could be five dollars, [and] it 
doesn’t matter — it’s what they love. 
The emotional component [of gift-
giving] is restored.”

digital self-portrait. Rosy, milky love 
showers from a dark indigo sky onto 
a purplish Wang, who covers her 
face in her hands as delicate little 
wispy hearts fall on her head and 
shoulders. 

“I drew it at a time when I was 
feeling down — boy troubles,” Wang 
said. “It turned out nice. Usually, 
when I feel strong emotions, the 
pieces turn out better.”

On the other hand, Wang pres-
ents a happier and carefree side to 
life in her paintings as well. Though 
Wang describes her own work as 
realist in relation to anime art, 
aspects of the surreal and a great 
deal of distortion often come up in 
her drawings. 

One such example is “Fishy 
Happenings,” a digital piece in 
which a slim girl walks down a path. 
On one side is a bustling metropo-
lis, and on the other is a sky full of 
clouds with exotic fish flying. Two 
Pokemon characters are also hidden 
in the drawing for fun. 

Though she is a freshman who 
has only been on campus for nine 
weeks, Wang got her paintings to be 
the only student works featured in 
The Loft by Googling and reaching 
out to find opportunities to show-
case art at UCSD. 

After coming in contact with 
UCSD Art Exhibit Coordinator 
Shanise Mok, Wang was able to put 
her art out in public for her first 
time at UCSD.

Though Wang has received high-
profile recognition for her work, her 
inspirations come from a humble 
source: the Internet. As of now, 
Wang draws from the styles of devi-
antart user ProdigyBombay and 
Tumblr user 70% EtOH. 

70% EtOH, a freelancer who also 
holds a Ph.D in pathology, has espe-

cially inspired Wang to look into 
the intersection of science and art. 
Wang is taking baby steps toward 
a life of science and art, drawing 
pictures of muscular and skeletal 
anatomy off of reference photos for 
her own practice.

However, with the overwhelm-
ing experience of being in college 
for the first time, art has taken a 
backseat for Wang as she adjusts to 
school and mostly consists of doo-
dling to make sure that her drawing 
skills remain up to par. 

“Art is something where I can 
destress and let my emotions flow 
through,” Wang said. “Some people 
use meditation. For me, it’s drawing 
— just sort of releasing stress and 
releasing the drawing.”

In terms of finding a commu-
nity of artists at UCSD, Wang has 
reached out to another artist at 
UCSD: Warren College freshman Su 
Cheong. Together, they do art trades 
and support each other when they 
are going through “art bloc,” the 
bane of an artist’s existence. 

Wang hopes to use her art to 
serve the community at UCSD, 
along the lines of art therapy and 
volunteering at a hospital. 

Wang also wants to continue 
to teachdrawing at local homeless 
women’s shelters.

These are big goals for the busy 
general biology major who’s always 
intent on improving her technique. 
But Wang considers her exhibition 
at The Loft as a solid start. 

“I feel like, ‘Wow, my work is 
actually hanging on a wall,’” Wang 
said. “It’s a bit of a surprise when I 
walk in, and it’s like, ‘That work is 
by me.’  I’m pretty happy I’ve gotten 
an opportunity to display my work, 
and I think I’m off to a good start.”

Wang Hopes to Contribute to the UCSD Community Through Art Therapy and Volunteer Work

For some, Daft Punk’s “Get 
Lucky,” featuring Pharrell Williams, 
is beyond overplayed — but “Get 
Data,” a song parody produced by 
UCSD’s graduate neuroscience pro-
gram to promote the annual Society 
for Neuroscience Meeting in San 
Diego, offers a fresh take.

In order to revamp “Get Lucky,” 
UCSD’s neurosciences program 
crowdsourced the lyrics, spent two 
days filming the music video — which 
features members of the program — 
and published “Get Data” online on 
Nov. 5. Since then, “Get Data” has 
gone viral on YouTube, garnering 
over 76,000 views to date. Some of 
the new parody lyrics include “She’s 
up all night to pipette/ I’m up all 
night to collect/ She’s up all night, no 
regrets/ I’m up all night to get data.” 

“Graduate students [in 2011] 
decided to make a music video paro-
dying Lady Gaga’s ‘Poker Face,’ but it 
was ‘Poster Face,’” graduate student 
Ethan McBride, who worked on this 
year’s music video and lyrics, said. 

“And I guess it’s becoming a tradition.”
By the third day “Get Data” was 

uploaded, it had already passed the 
17,000-view count of “Poster Face.” 

The neurosciences program pre-
sented its poster, a common way of 
presenting data at a large science 
conference, at SfN on Monday, Nov. 
11. The effort put into the creation of 
“Get Data” paid off, as the neurosci-
ences program’s social event at SfN 
was well attended. 

“A couple people even came up to 
Ethan and asked, ‘Are you that guy in 
the video?’” graduate student Ashley 
Juavinett said. “I think our social was 
well attended in part because of the 
video. In general, it was good public-
ity for our program.”

The video impressed by show-
casing the fun side of a serious 
graduate program.

“One of the YouTube comments 
[said], ‘Now I want to go to UCSD for 
grad school,’” McBride said.

The neurosciences program 
proved its point with “Get Data”, 
which put the graduate students’ 
antics, editing skills and musical tal-
ent on display.

“Our program has a good reputa-

tion for being a very social program 
where people have interests outside 
of science, such as making videos or 
music,” Juavinett said.

Micah Caldwell, husband of neu-
roscience graduate student Alie 
Caldwell, who provided the vocals 
for the video, spent just one day 
recording the audio and approxi-

mately nine hours editing.
UCSD’s neurosciences program 

is a family that you can’t find any-
where else. Besides working hard to 
collect data, they are also experts at 
having fun.

“I think we really do have a good 
community at UCSD for neurosci-
ence, and I think this video is a 

really good demonstration of that,” 
Juvanitt said. “There [are] some 
other [graduate] programs that I 
can’t see getting together on this 
video — it was definitely a team 
effort with many people.”

Up All Night to “Get Data”
Neuroscience graduate students from UCSD produced 
a music video parody that has gone viral on YouTube.

“In the !rst half, we shot poorly 
and we were totally out of sync,” 
UCSD head coach Heidi VanDerveer 
said to the UCSD Athletics Depart-
ment. “We regrouped at hal"ime and 
showed tremendous character the rest 
of the way.”

Within the !rst !ve minutes of 
the second half, the Tritons overtook 
the lead on a #urry of three-pointers. 
UCSD struggled back and forth with 
Western Washington leading to a 
55–55 tie. 

From there UCSD took over, never 
giving up the lead from the outset of 
the overtime period.

“In the !rst half, we weren’t mak-
ing shots, weren’t playing together 
and weren’t talking,” Seto said. “In our 
talk during hal"ime, we told ourselves 
that we need to pick it up and come 
together.”

On Friday, the Tritons faced Se-
attle Paci!c, losing 66–63. Despite 
getting 18 points out of Perry and 17 
points from Seto, UCSD couldn’t stop 
6-foot-2-inch Seattle forward Katie 
Benson, who scored 26 points and 
nabbed nine rebounds.

“We were down from most of 
the game and fought our way back,” 
VanDerveer said to the UCSD Athlet-
ics Department. “We out-rebounded 
them but had too many turnovers. We 
did have an opportunity to win a"er 
coming back and I’m proud of our ef-
fort.”

$is week, the Tritons will host 
the UCSD $anksgiving Classic. On 
Friday, Nov. 29, UCSD will face Metro 
State at RIMAC Arena at 7:00 p.m. 
$e following Saturday, the Tritons 
take on Azusa Paci!c at 6:00 p.m.

high school program prepared me re-
ally well for going to the next level,” 
Anderson said. “$ere are a lot of phi-
losophies of this team that I already 
shared coming in. As part of this fresh-
man class, I know we not only want to 
be able to acclimate to the new college 
game but do all we can to contribute to 
a championship caliber team.”

She also agreed with teammate 
White that the team’s support has 
helped her adapt to the college game. 

“I think that the support from 
teammates to help with the new things 
has helped me adjust to more obvious 
di%erences like speed of the game, both 
mentally and physically,” Anderson 
said.

$is rookie class will look to follow 
the winning tradition set forth for them 
by a program which won the CCAA 
Tournament last season and which set 
the school record for the longest win-
ning streak (26 games). Having lost 

the talents of guards Daisy Feder and 
Emily Osga, both !rst team all-CCAA 
members in 2012-2013, the team will 
need to !nd replacements for the pair’s 
scoring output. Both Feder and Osga 
were members of the 1000-point club 
by the time they graduated last year. 

“For the team as a whole, I think 
we have a mindset to be a postsea-
son team,” Anderson said, “Especially 
coming o% the conference champion-
ship last year.”

$e road to another championship 
will be a unique one with this bunch of 
new personalities.

“I feel like my class will bring a 
good amount of energy o% the bench 
and all go hard every second we are on 
the court,” White said. “We will also 
bring a little bit of fun during practice 
and games and also a little bit of swag.” 

We have already seen some of this 
with the excitement displayed by the 
women’s basketball team at Triton 
Power Hour, including in the perfor-
mance by White aka Rapper Jacks, 

in the event’s rap competition — for 
which she won an iPad mini.

Fans can expect a long stretch 
of home games for the Tritons this 
January. $e Tritons will be playing at 
Rimac three out of four weekends at 
the start of Winter Quarter 2014.

“I’m really excited to get the chance 
to witness a new community of fans 
and see other athletes and students that 
I have met so far at games,” Anderson 
said. “Playing in such a large gym, it 
should be awesome.”

$e Tritons started the road to a 
championship season with a confer-
ence win against Cal State San Ber-
nardino in their season opener, and are 
now 2–1 with the loss to Seattle Paci!c 
last Friday and an overtime win against 
Western Washington the following day.

$e Tritons’ next game is this Fri-
day Nov. 29 at Rimac Arena against 
Metro State, at the UCSD $anksgiv-
ing Classic tournament.

recorded an error and got blocked 
at the net to end the match 16–18 in 
Cal State Bernardino’s favor to hand 
the Coyotes their eight consecutive 
CCAA title.

Friday, No. 12 ranked UCSD took 
on Cal State Los Angeles to defend 
the second spot in the conference. 
$e Golden Eagles’ good hitting per-
centage and service pressure caused 
Triton losses in the !rst two sets in 
$e Eagles’ nest. 

UCSD answered by out-blocking 
Cal State Los Angeles in the next set. 
$e !nal set featured 13 tie scores and 
seven lead changes. $e Tritons had 
a match point attempt at 27–26, but 
UCSD ultimately fell in its second 

straight loss a"er the Golden Eagles 
closed out the match with three con-
secutive points. 

Saturday the Tritons were back at 
RIMAC Arena for their !nal match 
of the regular season against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. $e Tritons, 
who won last time the two met, had 
control for most of the match. A"er 
dropping the third set 25–19, UCSD 
took the early lead in the !nal set 
with good serving pressure and solid 
blocking, to hold on to the 25–16 
lead.

Saturday marked the !nal career 
regular season match for seniors 
Lizzy Andrews, Rachelle Kinney, Sara 
McCutchan and Brittany Lombardi. 
All four contributed against Domin-
guez Hills, but Ricci Luyties took note 

of Lombardi’s standout senior season.
On Wednesday, she broke the pro-

gram’s single season dig record with 
560 digs in 2013.

 “It has been a really   year and I’m 
going to miss the girls”, Lombardi said 
a"er the match Saturday. “But !rst we 
are going to continue our winning 
streak into the playo%s.”

UCSD will now wait until Mon-
day, Nov. 25, when the NCAA 
Tournament bracket is set to be an-
nounced, to learn of its postseason 
fate. Regionals run from Dec. 5 to 
Dec. 8 while the NCAA Champion-
ships take place Dec. 12 to Dec. 14 in 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

The Art of Changing Your Mind- Can you 
think outside of the box, and why not? 
This discussion will circle around the ques-
tion of how independent our thinking really 
is. We will discuss, for a little while, the 
question of “original thinking”, post mod-
ernistic (or other) reasons why we might or 
might not be able to think independently.
We hope to spend the larger part of the 
discussion on strategies and techniques that 
might enhance our capacity of independent 
thinking, and that strengthen our ability 
to change our mind on topics, when it is 
prudent to do so.Listing ID: 75718193 at

the weekend that they open to the public. 
President Kevin Rhodes and Brewmaster 
Nick Franchak have 30 combined years 
of experience in home brewing in addi-

sweet tap list had me at the Ginger Saison. 
Additionally their vision includes funding 
initiatives to provide fresh, clean water to 
those globally who do not not have access 
to drinking water. A $10 ticket will give you, 
logically, $10 worth of pints, tasters, or swag.

Against Division II powerhouses — No. 21 
Seattle Paci!c and No. 13 Western Washington — 
the UCSD women’s basketball team went 1–1 in a 
preseason tournament that brought forth would 
could be its new class of marquee players.

Juniors Miranda Seto and McKennan Bertsch 
both had big weekends. Seto – who could only 
be relied upon for a handful of points last season 
— scored 17 points against Seattle Paci!c and 16 
against Western Washington, following up on a 
career-high 21 points in UCSD’s season opener. 
Similarly, Bertsch — a 5-foot-11-inch forward 
who seems to have come into her own at the start 
of the season -— posted 14 points on top of 13 
rebounds last Saturday to power UCSD’s 72–66 
overtime win against Western Washington. 

"e two, along with four-year starting for-
ward Erin Dautremont and senior guard Megan 
Perry, will look to !ll in the gaps le# in the roster 
by graduated All-CCAA guards Daisy Feder and 
Emily Osga.

“Last year, we really relied on [Feder] to score 
points, but since we’ve lost her we’ve just all had 
to step up,” Seto said. “Last year me and Megan 
Perry weren’t as aggressive, and we knew that we 
needed to be more aggressive on o$ense to !ll in 
for Daisy and Emily.”

Last Saturday, UCSD got o$ to a slow start 
against the Vikings, down 32–19 by the end of the 
!rst half. 

UCSD’s historic season came to 
a close last Friday in the third round 
of the NCAA Tournament last week 
against Simon Fraser. 

Playing to a 1–1 draw a#er two 
overtime periods, the Tritons fell 4–3 
in its second penalty kick shootout of 
the postseason. 

“I thought our guys were tremen-
dous in the game, I couldn’t have 
asked for anything more,” UCSD head 
coach Jon Pascale said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. 
"e Tritons took the early lead on 

a goal by junior forward Alessandro 
Canale. In the 26th minute, senior 
mid!elder Cory Wolfrom sent a cross 
into the 16-yard box to !nd Canale, 
who buried the ball in the back of the 
net.

“I thought our guys, especially in 
the middle of the !eld were fantastic 
— Bagheri, Bauman, Wolfrom and 
Canale were able to move the ball re-
ally well today, and I think it caught 
Simon Fraser a little by surprise.”

A#er !ve yellow cards, and one red 
card issued to the Clan’s Lucas Ferritto, 
the Tritons looked to be the side head-
ing to the Elite Eight, although Simon 
Fraser outshot UCSD 12–6.  But with 
less than four minutes remaining in 
regulation time, Simon Fraser’s Jovan 
Blagojevich got on the end of a Clan 
throw-in to tie the score and record 

his ninth goal of the season.
"rough two overtime periods, 

neither side could break the tie. For 
the second time in seven days — hav-
ing beaten Chico State 5–4 in penalty 
kicks, Nov. 16 — the Tritons would 
head into a penalty kick shootout.

Last time, UCSD goalkeeper Josh 
Cohen made an unheard of three stops 
to lead the Tritons into the next round 
of the playo$s. "is time, Cohen came 
up big again, stopping Simon Fraser’s 
third and fourth attempts. But an un-
lucky miss by UCSD’s go-to free kick 
specialist Andisheh Bagheri — shoot-
ing in the one spot — as well as near-
misses from junior mid!elders Bran-
don Bauman and Will Pleskow would 
mark the end of the Tritons’ season.
"is season was the !rst time in a 

decade that the Tritons had advanced 
to the NCAA Tournament and the 
!rst time since 2005 that UCSD went 
to the conference tournament — nar-
rowly missing a CCAA berth in 2011 
and 2012.

“We went through a lot of close 
seasons, and watching them put it 
together this season has been a lot of 
fun,” Pascale said. “I’m excited about 
the future of this program, but the se-
niors have elevated it to a whole new 
level and for that, I will be forever 
grateful to them.”

A#er dropping crucial games to 
Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State 
Bernardino last weekend, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team wrapped 
up its regular season on Saturday 
with a four-set victory over Cal State 
Dominguez Hills at RIMAC Arena. 
"e Tritons !nish the season 25–5 

overall and 17–5 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association — 
dropping from second place last week 
to their !nal spot in third place.

“We went through two very emo-
tional and tough losses this week”, 
UCSD head coach Ricci Luyties said 
Saturday. “We were close in both but 
didn’t win. I told them [before the 
last match] we can start a new win-

ning streak right now. Coming back 
a#er those emotional losses is always 
tough, but I think they came out and 
played pretty well.”

On Wednesday the conference’s 
top two teams clashed at RIMAC 
Arena. "e Tritons were hungry for 
revenge a#er losing on the road 3–1 
to Cal State Bernardino earlier in the 
season, and with enough wins last 
week, the Tritons still had a chance to 
take the conference. 

UCSD took the !rst two sets, but 
the Coyotes stormed back and won 
the next two. Down 14–12 a tandem 
block by Caitlin Brenton and Sara 
McCutchan, along with an attack er-
ror by the Coyotes tied it at 14–14. 
UCSD had match point at 16–15 but 

At the start of a new season for the 
UCSD women’s basketball team, fans 
can expect to see a strong rookie class, 
who will bring some youth and exu-
berance to the program. 
"e reigning California Colle-

giate Athletic Association tournament 
champions brought on six incoming 
freshman: Cassie MacLeod, Hannah 
Johnson, Taylor Tanita, McKenzie 
Bolden, Jacquelynne White and Haley 
Anderson. 

UCSD brought on two new incom-
ing forwards this year in MacLeod of 
Chaminade College Prep in Westlake 
Village, Calif., and Hannah Johnson 
of Saratoga High School. "e two will 
battle with stalwart forward Erin Dau-
tremont and junior forward McKen-
nan Bertsch to crack UCSD’s starting 

!ve.
"ree games into the season, the 

Tritons have not seen much of John-
son, but MacLeod has seen some time 
on the court — appearing, most nota-
bly, for 15 minutes in last Friday’s loss 
to No. 21 Seattle Paci!c and scoring 
seven points. 

In addition, UCSD picked up four 
guards, including Tanita, White, An-
derson and McKenzie “Georgie” Bold-
en— so-called for her Georgia roots.

Freshman guard White, from Indio 
High School, is a human biology ma-
jor from Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
who said UCSD’s top-notch reputation 
made her decision to come and play 
here easy.

“I got into this school academically, 
and then made contact with the coach-
es to see if I could come here to play 
basketball,” White said. “I just thought 
this was a really good school academi-

cally and athletically so I thought this 
would be a great !t for me.”

So far, White said, the best part of 
the school year has been the basketball 
program.

“Just being a part of the team and 
having those 17 other people there for 
me to hang out with and to go through 
the pain, struggle and accomplish-
ments together has been great.” 

Anderson, another human biology 
major from Marshall College, came to 
UCSD from Oak Ridge High School in 
El Dorado Hills, Calif. 

Coming o$ a very successful senior 
season at Oak Ridge, the freshman 
guard recounts her Delta River League 
Championship, perfect 10–0 season 
and high-ranking playo$ !nish as a 
solid stepping stone into her collegiate 
career. 

“Personally, I feel as though my
