Leading the revolution 

Zach Grahm born in Poverty 
John MacGregor 

and Greg Fletcher 

Editor's :'\ote: Zach Grahm 
is tbe head of an organization 
called the New Yip, Grahm 
has announced plans for 
massive demonstrations at 
next summer's Republican 
National Convention in San 
Diego, Below is the fir t in a 
eries of articles about 

Grahm and his activities, 

Zachen' Grahm was born at 
a ven' young age In Twm 
Falls Minnesota on August 22 
1951 Whereas thiS came as a 
'urpn I' to Zach, who was 
hoplnl( lor a warmer cltmate 
hi arm'al was no surprise to 
hiS parents, In fact the:. had 
been expectmg him for some 
time 

Zach's lather BIll Grahm, 
the son 01 Hal,'or Grahm a 
lundallientalist preach 1' , was 
born 10 Poyert\' , a small 
shanty town to 'the hills 01 
West VirgInia When Bill was 
15 Grandpa Halvor moved the 
cla n to Chicago, where Bill 
met Gertrude Beezlev Bill 
Grahm approached Gertrud 
Beezlev In hiS usual charmlOg 
WJ\' arid said, " Will vou check 
m,; hal. please?" It was love 
at Ilrst sight. Shorth 
afterwards they were 
constant companions , they 
went e\'en'where together -
the drlve-m, the malt hop, 
and after SIX short years, the 
altar 

After three vears of bliss 
the ~tork blessed the Grahms 
With a bundle of JOY, Zacher~ 

It was a double blessing for 
th( Grahms- along With Zach 
they also got Ezekiel. Zach 's 
twm brother, who now works 
undercover for the Alam da 
(ounty Shenff's Department 
Olten 'Ezeklel Will pose as hi: 
tWin brothcl'. Zach, to obtain 
mlormatlon So b carelul II

Grahm - It may be Ezekiel 

Zach Grahm has always

didn 't like Z~ch In pm'ate , 
the prinCipal wa s once 
overheard to sa\' In just lfvlng 
hiS positIOn on Zach, " I hal'e 

After meditatIOns With the 
groovy Geru, Zach dl cover d 
the universa l truth, which IS, 

"ontogen~ recapitu l ate~ 
phylogenY. ThiS prinCipII' has 
guided Zach through many a 
dark moment 

Zach 's group, th !'lew \ Ip 
was formed as a spltnter 
group from th(' Old YIp , 
which has evol \led IOto the 
maIO political and social 
group which will be In 
evidence this summer when 
the circus come to town 
The\ can be recognized by 
thelrrallytng cry, " YIP, YIP, 
YIP, YIP, MOO MOO, MOO 
1\100, MOO, MOO, MOO. 
:\100, MOO, MOO, GET ,\ 
JOB'! " 

nothing against Zach 
personall~', but would yOU 
want your daughter to marn 
one'" ThiS was the ftnal 
dl illu ionment for Zach , who 
was in love with the 
princIpal's daughter' He left 
for the lar-off Hlma lavas 
With the Beachhoys, In search 
01 the grooyv Guru 

Membership possible 

Mter discover\, of the 
Truth, Zach returned to the 

nited States and acquired 
man:.' diSCIples , All eight 
bll hon 01 them Will be here in 
San Diego thiS summer for 
the Republican National 
Convention , The, Will art as 
the maIO coordlnatmg group 
for com'enllon protests 

The e\l' Yi p was born In

outSide Isla Vista , It was born 
In ~lIles Laboratone , and

"Jern' RubIO , leader of the

Zach will put youlh back IOta

o ~ C Uring the Spring Quarter of 
• • ",1970, a bi-Iingual preschool 

" program was started at UCSD 

~ by a group of students, The program consisted of bringing CJ in about 15 Chicano children from the La Jolla community once a week to prepare them 
~ for k i ndergarten a nd \ U elementary school. The idea 

_ roe-- was to provide them with 
~ preschool experiences, At that 

time it was called the CJ "Chicanito Program, .. Most of the children today in ~ the program are from low-
-..J income families in which 

E lea rning exper ience and stimuli such as books, puzzles, and other educational toys are 
'

not available, They often come 
from large families where both 
parents have to work , 

O Consequently, the children lack the personal attention and the 
adult gUidance needed to 

-:::;- develop the verbal skills upon 
which learning is based, 

-' 
--0-

Most of the children are also 
ha ndicapped b,v their lack of 
familiarity with Enghsh , Thus , 
two oC the main goals now are 
to make the children aware of 
what will be expected of them 
upon entering the formal 
educational vstem , and to 
familiarize Ihem wllh Ihe 
Engish language so they won 't 
be behind when they b gin 

s a 

After successfully continUing 
through the summer of 1970, 
the program attempted to 
bring children from other 
communities to the program , It 
was able to bring children from 
Solana Beach and San Ysidro, 
Unfortunately, extension of the 

program had to be limited as a 
result of the lack of ~upplles, 
equipment. and funds 

Th e following quarter 
(winter of 19711 th program 
became a student organtzation, 
and a name de criblOg the 
ideals and goals of the program

was cho en Since then the 
program has been known as 
MOSCA , Muchachltos

"The House of Blue Leaves" 
The West Coast premiere of John 

Gua re's successful off-Broadway play 
"The House of Blue Leaves" opened 
last week on the main stage of the Old 
Globe Theatre , Craig Noel's 
production of this 1971 Drama Critic 
Awa rd-winning pla y i s no 
disa ppointment It is, in facl. 
outstanding , and provides the be t 
evening of theater that [ have seen in 
the San Diego area in a long time , The 
play is wild and wacky, the humor 
often savage, Guare is working out of 
the traditions of the theater of the 
absurd and black humor , Albee's "ZOO 
SlOP;" and Feiffer's " Lillie Murders," 
for example, come to mi nd , Funny one-
liners. inSUlts, and ludicrous 
happenings tumble over one another, 
but in the end we wonder how what we 
ha\'e laughed at so loudly and so often 
could conclude so tragicallv, the 
comedy turns gnm and ends With 
murder , 

The entire action of the play takes 
place in a crumm v two· bedroom 
walkup in . ironically , the Sunn~' side 
section of Queens, Although only seven 
I'ears ago, the time seems long pa l. 
out of the '50's: it is. as one character 
5a\'S, " like walking anto a photograph 
album," [t is October 4. 1965. the day 
the Pope came to New York to appeal 
to America for peace in Vietnam Over 
teleVISIOn we hear his sober word at 
the United !\atlon descrabing 
Americans as a dutiful people " baSing 
Its conception of life on spiritual 
values, on a reltgious sense , on 
Ireedom, on lovalty " and so on, 

Far From tbe Truth 
:'\othing, Guare shows us, could be 

further from the truth In the Il\'Ing 
room of lhe middle·aged Artie 
,haughnessy , a zookeeper , we find the 
real Middle America - addled, dear. 
Insen itive. dangerou , ridlculou 

Arlie works b\' day at the Central 
Park Zoo but drea m ' of writing songs 
tor the movtes But all he i. capable of 
are dated, lousy Imitations of Tin Pan 
,\licv tunes, Like manv characters in 
the play, he has filntasies about 
:tartlng a new life . He plans to marr\' 

The New

Kathleen Woodward 
the irrepressible Bunny who lives in 
the apartment downstairs, put hi s 
di sturbed wife, Bananas , the most 
Intelligent and sane person of the lot. in 
a mental institution, and fly off to 
Hollywood where he Will. naturally, 
become famous , Nothing of the kind. of 
course, happens, His best friend makes 
off with Bunny, hiS son is thrown In the 
brig, and he strangles his wife, 

It is hard to sal' which of Artie 's two 
women (;auses ' the most laughter , 
although certain ly the high-strung . 
hollow·cheeked Bananas is the most 
pathetic Suffering from a nervou 
breakdown, he begs for her food like a 
dog, roiling over when she is done 
eating : and she mistakes brillo pads 
for hamburgers. Bunny. on the other 
hand , is healthy and full of energy and 
instructive anecdotes from the movie 
magazines , ot too bright, she IS vet 
clever enough to understand her 
assets: she knows how to hold on to a 
married man by holding out on him 

Itls not a question of sex She kno\\ s 
that she i a " lousy la:> ," as she puts H, 
and Will sleep with him am lime he 
wants, 

No Food 
he WII! not. however cook for him 

until after the\' are married In one of 
the ,runniest . cenes of the pia\' Artie 
pleads with her to make him JU t some 
egg He I desperate with lust. but she 
resist hiS advances There has to b 
some mvsterv left for t he honeymoon, 

The comedv of Act I inC rea es In 
frenzv and turn into bedlam, literally 
explodes , in Act II Artie 's son has Just 
sneaked home, AWOL, with a plot and 
two hand grenades to blow up the 
Pope Three nun , who are no lilt of 
the field , crash Artie 's liVing room b\ 
the lire e cape to watch the Pope's 
arm'a l on TV They are urly because 
Arlie can onlv offer dom stlC, not 
Imported beer. and fight o\'er the 
pra~lng rights to a fading platinum 
starl t who also Improbabh' happens 
bv , The TV has become a religiOUS 
shrine, and Arlie Instructs hiS 
demented Wife to kls the Pope ' 

image on the r 11d screen to make her 
well. One nun is persuaded to kick the 
habi t and becomes, ther fore , the gay 
divorcee, These, Guare tells us 
through what amounts to hilariOUS 
slapstick , are Amenca 's " spintual 
values, .. 

In this crazy world , storv-telhnl! IS 
the on Iv talent that Artie and the 
members of hiS family (extended I 
pOssess, All are obse sed With 
celebrities Jackie Kennedv , 
Cardinal Spellman , Sandra Dee - and 
weave fantasies and scenes from their 
pasts around them :'I10re often than

Ruggers Fail In 
San Diego Tourney , 

Lasl weekend found the UCSD 1 Rugby team in the first 
annua San Diego Rugby Tournament, sponsored by the Old 
Missicn Beach Athletic Club, of which our very own Coach 
Millenbah is vice-president. The tournament, which featured 
some )f the nation's top-rated rugby teams, was a two-day 
event ,n which each team played four games. The final round 
was on Sunday : UCSD finished in 13th place with an 
uOlmpressive 1-3 record. 

Our first game on Saturday was against the San Fernando 
Rugby Club, which blanked us 6-0. But later in the day we came 
back to beat Peninsula Ramblers 1[, a team comp6sed of 
Stanford alumni. 6-4. Now 1-1, we played Long Beach, who 
over-powered our tired ru~~ers 9-6. After a wild partv at 
surfside Saturday night, followed by a "blow-out" at the 'Red 
Garter in San Diego, Sunday's finals were anything but good 
games, as we lost to phYSically bigger San LUIS Obispo Rugby 
Club, 24-19 to seat us 10 13th soot. 

Although our team was not victorious, we did have some 
outstanding plays and players. Shifty Dickie Duncan made 
good his name as he wove his way through the opposition for 
three UCSD scores. "Golden Foot" Gates added some points 
with his toe to make UCSD look respectable. Veterans John 
Ringwood and serum-half Dick Ostrup helped hold the team 
together and keep our offense going. 

The tournament was helpful in pointing out a few 
weaknesses, but at the same lime hurt us with severallOjuries. 
Little Dickie Duncan had his face lifted in the pregame 
warmups and may never kiss again . Rich "Tootie" O'Toole 
was not able to finish the tourney because of a common injury 
known as ruggers ' ankle. Coach Peter Sertic was knocked out 
With a chest cave-in and "drunken" Waa dorp is convale cing 
with a rare abnormality known as " rugger's jock." 

While the 1 team was gelling its brains beaten in at Robb 
field, the UCSD II rugby team played a huge bunch of Marines, 
probably leftovers from the shores of Tripoli , on our home 
field , out by the gym. Anyway, our quick bunch of rookies 
sneaked by the giants to take an 8-7 halftime lead , allhough we 
spent most of the game holding them on our five yard line. The 
econd half started out strong, starring the new scoring 

combination of "Scatter-gum" Guthrie and Rick "Cud" Mizer. 
as we took a 14-7 lead : but , spurred on by their commanding 
officer, the meanest mother in their ranks, the Mannes 
stormed back to beat us 15-14 as we valiantly tried to gang 
tackle guys twice our size. and they proved moves ain't 
everything. Dickie Duncan. 

The highlight of a weekend of defeats was the rebirth of the 
UC D Rugby ChOir, led by conductor. Skip. Our bantone 
section was Without equal , but we're desperately in need of 
sopranos. So any girls interested In trying out, come thl 
Saturday to a triple·header ru~by tournament at UCSD.

will, cbeerful roguishness, and Smokey the Bear tbat he wears, 
Smokey, as be is called, quickly became aD institution, This 
Saturday be puts on his distinctive hat for the last time. Tbese 
are his parting words, 

I am leaving Revelle wi th mixed emotions. The pres ure of 
ho lding down two jobs is getting to be too much for me. WhIle.' 
enjoy this job more than I do the other one, frankly, It doesn t 
pay enough. 

There are man\, things that I will miss. Among these are the 
friendship, cama'raderie . and great moments. I have had more 
than my share of these. and the e memories are something 
that I w'iII fondlY remember 

Please do not think that I will disappear entirely . I have 
developed many fnendships here and I Intend to continue 
these, To those whom I WIll meet again I wish more good 
time . To those whom 1 WIll never see, I Wish good luck, 
Goodbye and God bless all of you .

A.S. Government (Rip-off?) 
In most SOCial histones, the power is 

Wielded by the organized rank . 
Unfortunately justice doesn't prevail. 
Simply becau e jusltce eXIsts , 
Organtzed power prevails upon mortal 
interaction UC San Diego is no 
exception 

Old \'ou eyer try to convince the 
Provost that the lan'guage requirement 
is trash? Justice is a tremendous 
concept. but what prevaIls? Crude 
power. Organization. The structure 
says the Provost is correct a prtorl. 
Result the Provost IS correct The 
tndlvldual student I a helpless pawn, 
unle, the pawns can organize to 
oppose such dIctums as a language 
requIrement. 

The mo t disorgantzed, fragmented 
elements fJ f the academIC community 
are the students I would contend that 
It IS no accident that the weakest 
element of the academiC communttv IS 
the students . 

The baSIC organization represenling 
the student IS ca lled something like 
A L"CSD The A government IS run b~' 
students who arc struggling to 
Improve the undergraduates ' status 10

spearhead('d an attempt to move the 

8) l('ve n Griffin 

niversity dorm rents into a more 
eqUItable price range jdrastlcally 
reduce the rent for hundred of 
students I, 

Not too many people heard about the 
famous !infamous? I shoul. . RENT 
STRIKE' , but even fewer people 
realized the A officers dedication. 

Paul Kaufman is the A President. 
He is a senior student who won 't ever 
be returntng to the dorms again: he 
lives in Enctnitas Here he IS. try 109 to 
help hundreds of resident students 
attain a more equitable rent level 
Why? ....... for 25C! an hour? 

( heard a rumor that is fairly 
InterestIng Paul Kaufman has 
withheld the salaries of various AS 
offlc13ls. Why? Because they didn 't 
measure up , they didn 't like working 
for 25C! an hour I shouldn 't. be so 
dogmatic . From all appearances. the 
ProgrammlO!( people have increased 
their salaries through other mans 

Tom Carvl IS the AS Vice· President 
He has been working rigorously trying 
to establish regulations to eliminate 
the grafts and klckback< What 's he 
worktng [or" Maybe 151! hourly . 
Gnreal " Tom has been parading 
around the ca mpu s trYIng to 
communicate WIth an endless stream 
of ad mlntstrators. attempttng to make 
tlie IiVtng conditIOns a little bit more 
eqUitable for YO . 

Fred Fructendler is an unreal fellow . 

He 's from out·ofstate so he has tru lv 
gigantic tuition bills, He works at a 
cheap hamburger stand. that IS .... 
when he i n't chasing after the Coast 
Crul er driver to keep them on 
schedule, pushing internal reform , 
and attempting to organize students -
outside of hi ludy brea ks. What does 
Fred get paid? Maybe 10C! hourly. 

Somehow the local fasci ts manage 
to convince a large portIon of tite 
student populace that the AS offtcers 
are , vep, I hate to say it but. overpaid. 
Why? 25a an hour is too much? If Paul 
Kaufman is successful with ONE of his 
ideas. he could eaSily save you 
HUNDREDS of dollars . 

There is an incredible school of 
thought on this campus concerning the 
potentcy of the student government. It 
IS rtdiculous to say that the AS IS a 
pats,V - arbitrarily . The student 
government IS what YOU make it. If 
you don't help. then it will be strapped 
for energy. 

There is a fallacy that the student 
government cannot accomplish 
anything. ThIS IS ridiculous, becausc It 
presumes that lhere IS nothing to be 
accomplished RUBBISH ' 

How many of you people have gone 
to the bookstore recently? Need I say 
more? Things can charige. they wlil 
change with active support. 

The first Item that vou should 
support IS a d cent salary fur the AS 
people.

Notes on Repression: to defendants who are guilty of attemptIng to flee the state , as Miss Davis dId successfully for several months. Itls also true 
that elaborate safety precauttons are being taken - and that is 
just what they are , safety precautions to protect Miss Da vis 
and to protect her protectors from the sort of event for which 
she is on trial. And if there is any "raci st hysteria" emanating 
from the proceedings, it certainly must be com';,g from those 
who claim that, because Miss Dal'is is black, she ipso facto 
cannot be gUilty of anything. especially anything so 
distastefu lly repressive as murder, conspiracy, or kIdnapping

places poltt.lcal diSSIdents In menta' InstItutIOns and treats 
them WIth mind·altenng drugs. a fact well '.In to free·world 
students of SovIet society 

By Kevin Olson 
The trial of Angela Davis is just now getting into gear. but 

the propaganda mills have been spinning wildly for some time. 
The general line is that Miss Davis is a victim of "repression": 
that not only she but a whole race of people are on trial. In her 
own words : " My life is at stake, but as I have repeatedly said, 
not simply the life of a lone individual. but a life which belongs 
to black people and all who are tired of poverty and racism and 
the unjust imprisonment of lens of thousands." 

Tbe Facts Speak 
Unfortunately for her supporters, no amount of rhetoric or 

distorting generalizations can remove the fact that Miss Davis 
purchased the weapon whose use resul ted in the most 
unquestionable form of repression known. i.e. death, to several 
people, Including a judge , And while Miss Davis ruminates 
upon this. in her two·room cell replete with television , radio. 
and electric ty(>t!writer, I suggest she arrange her notion of 
repression by examining the little·known case of Vladimir K. 
K. Bukovsky. 

Protest - Symptom of " Insanity" Such recidivist rhetoric should sou nd familiar. I do not know 
anyone who is not tired of poverty and racism, or who does not 
abhor the unjust imprisonment of people, regardless of race or 
number - but how does such grandiose phraseology relate to 
or constitute the " repression " of Angela Davis? It is true that 
she is being denied bail - because it is customary to deny bail 

In Mr. Bukovsky's country such things as trial are run ven' 
effiCiently. There are no year·long dela~'s of proceedIngs. 
because they do not iJother with such legal technIcalities as 

Mr , Bukovsk~' should be especlall:v famIliar With the truth of 
this contenlion. however. for It happened to htm In 1963. at the 
age of 20, He was arrested for havtng In hI po sessIOn an
