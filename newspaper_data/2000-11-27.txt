that she had seemed to be doing 
very well. Several friends comment-

AASU Holds UCSD 
Kwanzaa Celebration 
Musical acts, speakers and food were enjoyed 
at the ceremony' in the Price Center Monday 
., PAJIIICK 111 
Contributing News Writer 

Dozens of students rn;m many cultures 
gathered at the Price Center ballroom last 
Monday to share in the African-American 
Student Union's celebration of Kwanzaa. The 
celebration was a three-hour event that fea-
tured music, poetry, food and a keynote. 
speaker. 

The event's program was a busy one, 
beginning with a drum call and other tradi-
tions that have been part of the celebration of 
Kwanzaa since its inception in the 19605. 
Owna Cortes performed the Libation ceremo-
ny, an ancient African teaching intended to 
honor one's ancestors by pouring water into 
earth. 

"Our ancestors suffered a great many 
hardships to bring us to where we are today: 
Cortes said. "Let us not forget this; let us be 
grateful and honor them every day." 

She then invited those present, instead of 
honoring just those historical heroes of the 
African culture, to name deceased family . 
members so they might be honored d.uring 
the pouring of the Libation. 

Shermo:n's Cajun Creole provided dinner, 
while UCSD catering presented and served 
the food. Included on the menu were 
gumbo, red beans and rice, collard greens, 
sweet potatoes and crawfish, among other' 
dishes. 

"Kwanzaa is the celebration of the har-
. vest; said AASU Director of Publicity Ashley 

Winston of the cultural basis for the menu. 
"1l'aditionally the meal has very little meat 
and is made Pi imlrily of grains and vegeta-
bles.w 

After dinner, the AASU presented its 
keynote speaker, Mzee (Elder) Kadumu 
Moyenda. Moyenda, in addition to being an 
iridologist who has studied under Paul 
Gross, is a teacher in the San Diego Unified 
School District and an Elder in the "Rites of 
Passage" for Boys and Girls in San Diego. 
Moyenda spoke generally about the meaning 
of Kwanzaa and the motivations behind its 
creation. 

"For 400 years, our culture had been 
oppressed in America: Moyenda said. "It 
needed a tradition. It needed something that 
reflected us as a people." 

Moyenda made it clear that, like other hol-
iday traditions, the idea of Kwanzaa is not to 
exclude other cultures, but to be specifically 
representative of the African culture, much as 
Christmas is specifically representative of the 
Christian tradition . 

Moyenda's oration also focused on the 
idea of transitions and rites of passage, the 
steps and stages necessary to properly 
progress to full adulthood. 

"It's my second time here at UCSD and it's 
always nice to see what'S going on on college 
campuses today: Moyenda said. "That's 
because today's universities are the founda-
tions of the future." 

As much as it was a cultural event, the 
AASU Kwanzaa celebration was an educa-
tional one as well . The rrogram included a 
history of Kwanzaa as we! as a demonstration 
and explanation of its many traditions, sym-
bols and practices . 

Entenainment during the evening includ-
ed several poetry readings and a performance

Ten UCSD 
Professors 
Honored 
Faculty members recently 
received various awards 
I, MARGARET O'NEIU 
Staff Writer 

Ten UCSD professors from the division \if 
social sciences were recently recogni7.ed for 
their achievements in their fields. 

Diana Deutsch, a professor of psychology, 
was named a fe llow of the division of applied 
experimental and engineering psychology of 
the American Psychological Association . 

"I was pleased, not in the sense that it was 
inappropriate, but it wasn 't something I'd 
worked toward," Deutsch said . "But I was 
obviously very pleased. I felt good about it." 

Deutsch had previously been named a fel-
low to two other divisions of the APA: the 
division of psychology and the arts in 1991 
and the general psychology division in 1997. 

Deutsch 's work is heavily integrated with 
audio studies, particularly with differences in 
how music is perceived. She has also done 
studies involving balance and placement of 
instruments within an orchestra . 

Deutsch has been named a fellow to many 
other societies in areas of psychology and 
audio engineering. She founded the Society 
for Music Perception and Cognition and is 
the founding editor of the journal Music PI!1'-
ception. She gave a speech on perfect. pitch at a 
Mozart festival at the Kennedy Center in 
Washington, D.C. in 1998. 

"The fact that I'm fellow of all these soci-
eties really does reflect that my work is inter-
disciplinary," Deutsch sa id . 

Economics professor Rob Engle was 
'named a fellow of the American Statistical 
Association, for his individual contributions 
to the advancement of statistics. Engle has 
been a member of this society since 1989. He 
has been a member of UCSD staff since 1975. 
Engle is currently working in New York for a 
year. 

"A People 's History of the Supreme Court" 
(1999, Viking; 2000, Penguin), by political sci-
ence professor Peter Irons has received a 2000 
Silver Gavel Certificate of Merit from the 
Alnerican Bar Association for its "contribu-
tion to public understanding of law and the 
legal system." 

Irons, a UCSD staff member s ince 1982, 
received his master's and Ph.D. degrees in 
political science from Boston University and a 
J.D. degree from Harvard University. 

Rebecca Klatch, an associate professor of 
sociology, received various awa rds for her 
book, A Generation Divided: the New Left, 
the New Right, and the 1960s (1999, UC 
Press). The book was chosen Book-of-the-
Month by the libertarian organization Free-
dom Network. She was honored by the Amer-
ican Sociological Association with the 2000 
Distinguished Scholarship Award from the 
section on social movements and collective 
behavior. 

Klatch was a finalist for the C. Wright Mills 
Award, which is given to authors whose 
books are written in the tradition of Mills. 

"I'm very happy to have received such 
recognition from scholars and the larger com-
munity," Klatch said . 

"A Generation Divided" is currently being 
translated into Chinese.

wide, meeting with undergraduate 
students in both informal and class-
room settings to give a major address 
at each campus for the entire acade-
mic community. 

Phi Beta Kappa's visiting scholars 
program is designed to enrich the 
intellectual atmosphere of colleges 
with chapters and to let undergradu' 
ates meet and interact with distin-
guished scholars of many disciplines. 

The British Society for the History 
of Science awarded sociology profes-
sor Steven Shapin the Dingle Prize 
for "Best Book Bringing the History 
of Science before a Wider Audience 
for his book, The Scientific Revolu-
tion." 

Shapin holds master's and Ph.D. 
degrees in history ~nd sociology of 
science from ·the University of Penn-
sylvania. He has been a member of 
UCSO's staff since 1989. 

Political Science professor Kaare' 
Strom was elected a fellow of the 
Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences 
and Letters. This organization is the 
oldest scholarly society in Norway, 
Strom's country of origin, and it is 
similar to the United States' National 
Academy of Sciences. Strom lived in 

orway until 1974, and then again 
from 1983-1985. 

The society, which is based in 
Trondheim, Norway, has meetings six 
times per year. Strom will be attend-
ing a meeting in May for his official 
induction. 

Strom received his bachelor 's 
degree in political science from Saint 
Olaf College, and his master's and 
Ph .D. in the same area from Stanford. 
He also studied at the University of 
Oslo, Norway. 

David Swinney, a professor in the 
psychology department, was named 
an honorary university professor at 
the University of Queensland, Aus-
tralia.

since 1992, received his bachelor's 
degree in psychology and his master's 
in language disorders and speech 
pathology from Indiana University 
and his Ph .D. in psycholinguistics 
and cognition from the University of 
Texas. 

Twelve-year UCSD faculty mem-
ber psychology professor john 
Wixted received the 2000 George A. 
Miller award as a co-author of his 
1999 paper "Psychophysics of 
Remembering: which appeared in 
the "Journal of Experimental Analysis 
of Behavior." 

The "Journal of Experimental 
Analysis of Behavior" publishes basic 
experimental psychological research 
in animals and humans, with an 
emphasis on behavior. 

Wixted, who teaches Psychology 
144: Memory and Amnesia, co-
authored the paper with K. Geoffrey 
White, a professor of psychology at 
the University of Otago in New 
Zealand. "I was notified through e-
mail first [of winning the award! and 
I thought it was a joke," Wixted said. 
"I thought they preferred super high-
profile papers." Wixted felt his paper 
was more laboratory-b~ed than most 
winners of the award.

The Electoral College is an obselete mechanism needing refO'f71'! Abolishing the Electoral College would cause more confusion 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

111e never-ending controversy in Florida 
is enough to make a person even more cyni-
cal about today's pol itics in the United States, 
if tha t is possible. Not since 1887, when Con-
gress created an election law regarding voter 
rights, has the fate of a new American presi-
dent hinged for so long on a single state. 

Many Americans are oblivious to how our 
country's politics work. One would hope that 
by now, however, they have at least learned 
that they do not actually vote for their presi-
dents. Their vote is far more indirect. In 
accordance to our country's official form of 
electing presidents, the Electoral College sys-
tem, Americans vote for other people to vote 
for thei r president. In other words, even .if a 
candidate wins the popular vote of the peo-
ple, he may still lose the election if he loses 
the electoral vote. Sound stupid? Well, you 
are not the only one who thinks so. 

According to a recent article in Nt?lJJsweek, 
many have described it as "a dinosaur that 
should be retired to a museum," "an 
appendage to an anachronism" or "a train 
wreck wai ting to happen ." Many prominent 
politicians are part of th is list of Electoral 
College critics. For instance, New York Sen-
ator-elect Hillary Clinton and Ca lifornia 
Gov. Gray Davis, two politicians who appear 
to be the front-runners fo r the 2004 Demo· 
cratic presidentia l nomination, have urged 
the eradication of the entire system. 

Throughout America's history, there have 
been attempts to reform the Electoral Col-
lege or abolish it altogether. Today, more 
than 700 such attempts at reforming the sys-
tem have been made, most recently in this 
year's election. Past presidents Franklin Roo-
sevelt, Richard Nixon and jimmy Carter have 
been among the past attempted reformers. 

Perhaps the biggest drawback of the 

can be elected even if he docs not win the 
popular vlJte. Such a characteristic cheapens 
the notion of a so-called fair democracy, one 
in which the views of a people are suppos-
edly reflected in the pol itical process, espe-
cially one as significant as the election of 
their president. 

Ironically, an American president has 
been elected withou('winning a majority of 
the popular vote 15 times. It occurred twice 
in the case of Bill Clinton ; he won only 43 
percent and 49 percent of the popular vote 
in 1992 and 1996, respectively. 

Put simply, the system is old. In fact, it's 
so old that at one time, its primary objective 
was to give a political edge to slave owners, 
many of whom, not surprisingly, were mem-
bers of the Electoral College. 

The Electoral College was born in a 
country far different from the one we live in 
today. Two hundred years ago when the 
framers created it, they emphatically did not 
want a president dependent on the legisla-
ture. Consequently, they immediately reject-
ed a model reminiscent of England's parlia-
mentary system which allowed the legisla-
ture to pick its own leader as chief executive 
officer and prime minister. 

Post-colonial traveling was very difficult, 
and this made the transfer of information 
slow and tedious. Adding to this was the fact 
that no I:Jational parties existed, leading the 
framers to fear that many regional candi-
dates would divide the vote and subse-
quently skew the election process. 

Proposals to select presidents by direct 
national popular election were shot down 
quickly and deemed impractical for a young 
nation so large and spread out. Three rea-
sons were given by the framers, according to 
the testimony of Yale professor Akhil Amar 
to the House judiciary Committee in a 1997 
hearing on Electoral College reform.

By PARNAZ TAHERI 
Contributing Opinion Writer . 

Two hundred years ago, our founding 
fathers developed a method of electing a 
president by way of an institution known as 
the Electoral College. This system, in which 
voters choose state electors who are then 
entitled to vote for the president, has caused 
some controversy between those who want 
to keep it and those in favor of abolishing it. 

My question is: Why touch something 
that does not need to be changed? The 
quest of some to change the method of 
electing the president will only complicate 
things and disrupt the current, legitimate 
institution of the Electoral College. 

The majority of people who favor the abo-
lition of the Electoral College want the pop-
ular vote to be the deciding factor in electing 
the president, especially now that we have no 
president-elect almost a month after election 
day. But when the framers of the Constitu-
tion organized the idea of the Electoral Col-
lege, they sought to organize the best possible 
method of election that would prevent what 
has come to be called populism. 

So why is the Electoral College the best 
system for electing the president? For one, 
there could be no replacement, such as pop· 
ular vote, that would come even to improv· 
ing th e election of the president. In fact , 
direct elections would only produce more 
disputes in choosing a president than the 
current system. 

It is for this reason that the election 
process in Congress is not based on majori· 
ty rule (the winning candidate does 1I0t haye 
to have the majority of the votes) and feder-
al judges are not elected, but are appointed. 
For instance, take into consideration this 
year's election. Were there a tight race 
between the candidates, a direct election 
would result in recounts all over the country, 

Second, there is no reason the Electoral 
College should be changed or tampered with. 
With results still pending in this year's elec-
tion, only twice in this century (1960 and 
1976) has the candidate with an Electoral 
College majority failed to win a majority of the 
states. Therefore, not only does the Electoral 
College narrow the close races to a few states, 
but it also produces a winner without too 
much trouble or controversy. This contradicts 
the claim by many that the right president 
does not win, since he is given more electoral 
votes than the popular vote reflects. 

It should also be taken into considera-
tion that without the Electoral College, the 
opportunity for third party candidates to 
enter the race would more or less cease to 
exist. With the existence of third party can-
didates in direct elections, there would be a 
need to have more run-off elections in order 
to pick a winner who would have the major-
ity. of votes. This would then lengthen the 
process of choosing a president. Without 
the presence of the Electoral College, there 
would no longer be opportunities for such 
candidates as Ross Perot and, of course, 
Ralph Nader, to enter the presidential race 
with any hope for success. 

Another question concerns campaign-
ing. What would happen to the campaigning 
Ieyc:i if the Electoral College were abolished 
and direct election took its place? Without a 
doubt, the election would purely be media-
based, since there would be no incentive for 
the candidates to present specific interests 
or organize new ideas. Even though with the 
Electoral College there is a tremendous 
amOunt of media-based advertisements, a 
direct election would be purely that: candi-
dates would compete on a level of stealing 

·each other's votes, and nothing else. All the 
candidates' attention would merely be 
focused on the highly populated states and

First, very few candidates would 
have truly continental reputations 
among ordinary citizens. As a 
result, most Americans would not 
have enough information to intelli-
gently choose a national figure for 
president. 

Second, a president elected by a 
national popular vote was seen 
with much suspicion. Many 
founding fathe.rs felt that a populist 
presidency was at risk of attracting 
demagoguery and even dictator-
ship if one man claimed to be the 
voice of the American people. 

Third, the framers believed a 
national popular election would 
ruin the delicate balance of power 
among states. For example, south-
ern voices would count less in a 
direct national election because 
slaves were not allowed to vote. In 
addition, abuses in voting practices 
could result from a popular elec-
tion. 

"A state could increase its clout 
by recklessly extending its fran-
chise," Amarsaid. "FOF example, if a 
state let women vote, it could dou-
ble its weight in a direct national 
election." 

The framers endorsed an Elec-· 
toral College system because it 
allowed a state to get a fixed num-
ber of electoral votes no matter 
how broad or narrow its franchise. 

Amar claimed the system is 
painfully outdated. . 

"I consider the so-called Elec-
toral College a brilliant 18th-cen-
tury device that cleverly solved a 
cluster of 18th-century problems," 
Amar said. "As we approach the 
21 st century, we confront a differ-
ent cluster of problems and our

None of the reasons the framers 
had for defending the Electoral 
College system is relevant today. 
For one thing. almost all Americans 
are familiar with the candidates 
running for the presidency. Even if 
they are not, today's advanced 
communications technology 
allows all information on a candi-
date to be virtually a click away. 
The mass media alone is enough to 
relay sufficient amounts of infor-
mation about a candidate, even 
though it is often biased in nature. 

With the existence of different

dictatorship are highly unlikely .

Thinking about getting rid of the 
Electoral College is only the seed of 
the problem. Actually attempting to 
abolish the Electoral College is a 
complicated mess that would only 
add to the controversy. Since the 
institution is written into the Consti-

approval by two-thirds of each house

Over 100 junior high and high 
school kids visited UCSD and met 
with AS members on November 
21 , as a part of the AS Outreach 
Program (ASOP). Students gat on 

women are able to vote and are no 
longer selectively disenfranchised. 
States do not playas big a part in 
deciding whether to give the voters 
a direct voice in choosing electors, 
nor do they playas significant roles 
in defining the electorate. 

The Electoral College suffers 
from other faults, as well . Over the 
years, it has tended to over-repre-
sent voters in rural states. For 
instance, in 1988, seven of the least 
populous jurisdictions in the Unit-
ed States, including the District of 
Columbia, combined to have the 
same number of electoral votes as 
Florida: 21 . At the time, however, 
the combined population of those 
seven jurisdictions was only one-
third the population of Florida. 

Yet another criticism of this 
antiquated system is that the elec-
toral votes of each state are award-
ed solely on a winner-take-all basis, 
in 'which case the potential of a 
third-party or independent candi-
date to win any electoral votes is 
pitifully slim. 

Defenders of the Electoral Col-
lege system argue that to abolish it 

would create a larger controversy 
than the one that already exists. If the 
College's opponents would leave the 
issue alone. there would be no need 
to go through the hassle of amend-
ing the Constitution. 

In reality, all the Electoral College 
does is take into consideration the 
popular vote and make the election 
easier through the elimination of the 
margin of error of the vote. Accord-
ing to a testimony by Walter Bums, 
the resident scholar for the Ameri-
can Enterprise Institute, "The Elec-
toral College is ultimately spread out 
in a system of one man, one vote and 
majority rules," with the exception 
being that the majority rules at the 
s~te level. Thus, the college is the 
most fair and least complicated way 
for America to choose its president."

would be profoundly dangerous. 
They say that it would allow presi-
dential candidates to direct their 
campaign attention solely to those 
areas with the largest populations. 
With campaign conduct already 
under heavy scrutiny, many of 
them feel the problems would only 
get worse were the current system 
revised. 

My retort to these defenders is 
really quite simple: Time causes 
change and America as a nation 
has followed suit accordin~ly. All 
complications which may arise as a 
result of the abolishment of the 
Electoral College system should be 
anticipated and prepared for: After 
all, everyone knows that any signif-
icant social change necessitates an 
almost equal amount of adjust-
ment. Such is evolution and the 
nature of transition. 

Let this year's mess of an elec-
tion be proof that America is in dire 
need of change in its method of 
selecting its presidents. In times of 
change, America has followed suit 
admirably before. I say it's high 
time we did so once again. 

I t is safe to say that when the 
founding fathers developed the idea 
of the Electoral College, their inten-
tions were only for the best. More 
!mportantly, the college is written in 
the Constitution, and that furthers 
its legitimacy to the greatest extent. 
What the abolitionists need to real-
ize is that getting rid of the Electoral 
College would be not only disad-
vantageous to the candidates, but to 
the country in general. Besides, who 
can really say or prove that a presi-
dent elected directly by the people 
will be a better president than one 
elected by the Electoral College? 

The Electoral College is still in 
the Constitution and what the 
Constitution says is what should be 
followed . If we have something that 
still works today. why touch it?

Florida Legislators Trade Charges of 
Partisanship During Special Session 

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - With 
Republicans inching closer to 
calling a special session of the 
Legislature this week to name 
Florida's 2S electors, legislative 
leaders of both parties abandoned 
even the slighlcst pretense of 
bipartisanship Sunday. 

Each side accused the other of 
trashing major institutions of gov-
ernment for the sake of self-inter-
est and political ambition. Neither 
gave any sign of seeking any 
accommodation that might pull 
this fractured , exhausted stale 
back t{om the brink of a political 
crisis. 

Democrats, who are a 77-to-43 
minority in the House and 25-to-
15 minority in the Senate, said 
that Republicans had rigged the 
membership of a newly formed 
sdect committee whose work this 
week is expected to set the stage 
for a special session, 

The committee, made of eight 
Republicans and six Democrats 
drawn from chambers. was 
formed on Friday by Tom Feeney, 
the House speaker. and john 

McKay, the president of the Sen-
ate, both supporters of Gov. 
George W. Bush of Texas. \ 

In an interview Sunday, state 
Rep. Lois Frankel, the House 
minority leader, said that in select-

"He's a very shrewd 
politician. He's always 
tactical. Nothing is ever 
by happenstance. II 

- R .... lois FrMk.1 

ing the committee, Feeney had 
deliberatdy excluded Democrats 
who were lawyers well-versed in 
the consti tutional issues. 

Asserting that Rep ubli can 
leaders had decided to make the 
Legislature "an arm of the 
George W. Bush campaign," 
Frankel accused Feeney of weak-
ening the presence of Democrats 
on the committee by naming 
Democrats from districts with 
substantia l Bush support. In 

doing so, she said, Feeney is 
counting on these Democrats to 
be less aggressive tha n those 
who come from Gore strong-
holds. 

"He's a very shrewd politician," 
Frankel said of Feeney. "He's 
always tactical. othing is ever by 
happenstance." 

In an interview Sunday after-
noon, Feeney denied any such 
machinations. "I've picked mem-
bers for the committee ihat are 
very well respected; he said. 

Some Democratic lawmakers 
have been pressing for a boycott 
of the select committee, arguing 
that to participate might lend 
credibility to a process they view 
as rigged. But Frankel ruled out a 
boycott. 

"Somebody has to be there to 
speak up for our side; she said. 
"We have an obligation to keep 
fighting and fighting and fighting 
with every legal means at our dis-
posal. We wilrbe ~here."

Some of South Africa's White Voters 
Bewildered by Changes in Elections 

JOHANNESBURG, South 
Africa - It is election season, and 
politicians are rolling through 
Sophiatown, a stronghold for the 
white opposition, where people 
distrust the black govern ment and 
reminisce about the days of all-
white rule. 

And so when whites began 
posting election ftyers here. resi-
dents of this prtdominantly white 
neighborhood rubbed their eyes 
in cIisbelid. 

To their surprise, they learned 
that the opposition party was 
competing with the governing 
African National Congress ' for 
black suppon in next month's 
local elections. The electoral 
prize is no longer just working-
class white homeowners; It is 
black maids, black gardeners and 
black supermarket clerks. 

Opposition officials have tout-
ed their decision to coun South 
Africa's black majority as a critical 
step away from racially polarized 
politics. Bur at Mary's Hair Bou-
tique and at Tasty's Take-Away 
restaurant. there is little celebra-
tion as shears clip-clip and burg-
ers sizzle. 

Instead. the talk is more often 
about growing confusion and dis-
illusionment among whites, who 
struggle to understand the shift-
ing political landscape. 

"Whites must look after 
whites and blacks must look after 

To their surprise, they 
learned that the ' 
opposition party was 
competing with the 
gUlJeT1ling African 
National Congress for 
black support in next 
months local elections. 
blacks; they mustn't look after 
mc," said 

Martin Nayler, a 60-year-old 
parking attendant, as he guided 
traffic at a shopping center. 

Asked whether the opposition 
party, the Democratic Alliance, 
was looking after whites in Sophi-
atown, Nayler shook his . head 
sadly. "I don 't think so: he admit-

ted. "They're like the ANC now. 
It's very confusing. That's the 
whole problem. We don't know 
who to vote for." 

As this nation prepares to vote 
on Dec. S for local council mem-
bers in 284 ci ties and towns, a 
record number of white voters 
remain undecided about which 
party to support, according to a 
national survey released from the 
Human Sciences Research 
Council. 

Whites make up only about 10 
percent of the population here 
and many find it hard to see how 
their vote matters. "We found 
people saying. 'We're marginalized 
anyway; what difference does it 
make if we vote?'" said Stephen 
Rule, the manager of public opin-
ion surveys for the Human Sci-
ences Research Council. a non-
profit research group. 

"I found that particularly 
among white Afrikaans voters: 
Rule said. "A fairly common com-
ment was, 'The numbers are 
against us; so what's the point?'"

Disability: 
Langevin's community 
rallied around him 
ContI ...... front ..... 1 
prompted the officials who run the 
Capitol building to speed up their 
renovation projects. 

The floor of the men's room is 
being rebuilt to allow Langevin 
(pronounced LAIN-je-vin) the 
same access as everyone else. A 
cloakroom telephone booth will 
be refitted for his use. And alter-
ations are planned to allow 
Langevin. in his wheelchair. to 
vote, debate and mingle with law-
makers. 

"For the first six months l was 
in the Senate, I had to use the 
ladies' room," said Sen. Max Cle-
land, D-Ga. Cleland, a triple 
amputee elected in 1996, knows 
the obstacles Langevin faces. Cle-
land's wheelchair could not fit in to 
the Senate men's room or squeeze 
through various committee rooms 
before workers began installing 
ramps and making other adjust-
ments. 

The effort to accommodate 
people wi th disabilities in the 
Capitol began a decade ago: But as. 

Israel: . 
Bombing took place 
in Shabaa Farms area 
ContInu'" "0lIl ..... 1 

The fighting, accompanied by 
stone-throwing at Isr'l.eii soldiers 
elsewhere along the Lebanese 
border, raised renewed concerns 
that the Palestinian uprising in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
could ign~te wider conflict along 
Israel's borders. 

Deputy Defense Minister 
Ephraim Sneh accused Syria, the 
dominant force in Lebanon, of 
permitting Sunday'S bombing. He 
also asserted that the attack had 
been ordered by Iran, which 
backs Hezbollah, or the Party 'of 
God. 

"Hezbollah wants to drag us 
into a confrontation on four fronts 
- we're not interested," Sneh said 
in a television interview, referring 
to Syria, Lebanon, tfie West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. Israel, he said, 
would not be drawn into a "ping-
pong" of guerrilla attacks and retal-
iation . 

The bombing was in an area 
known to Lebanese as Shabaa 
Farms and to Israelis as Har Dov. 
on the southwestern slopes of 
Mount Hennon. 

Hezbollah and the Lebanese 

Alan M. Hantman, the architect of 
the Capitol, put it: " It's a work in 
progress. We have a lot more to 
do." 

I t was a freak accident 20 years 
ago that left Langevin paralyzed 
from the neck down. 

He was a police cadet. 16, in 
Warwick, R.I., when a SWAT team 
member pulled the trigger on his 
semiautomatic pistol in the police 
locker room, believing it was 
unloaded as he showed it to a 
friend . The bullet ricocheted off a 
locker and severed Langevin's 
spinal cord. Gone in an instant was 
Langevin's dream of a career in the 
FBI. 

Langevin'S community rall ied 
around him. 

"It thrust me into a public life 
whether I liked it or not," he said . 
"And I didn't like it at the time." 

Langevin, 36 and single, said 
he would devote most of his 
attention to issues that had noth-
ing to do with his accident or dis-
ability, like improving education 
and reducing prescription prices 
for the elderly. 

But the disability will no doubt 
have a bearing. 

-Mark Lacey 
The New York Times 

. government assert that the area is 
occupied Lebanese territory. How-
ever the United Nations, which 
verified the Israeli pullback from 
Lebanon, de.termined that the area 
is not Lebanese but land captured 
by Israel from Syria in the 1967 
Middle East War. 

Hezbollah. which fought a 
guerrilla war for 22 years to oust 
Israeli troops from southern 
Lebanon, has vowed to fight on 
to regain Shabaa Farms. Last 
month it seized three Israeli sol-
diers on patrol in the area. . 

The bomb that exploded on 
Sunday was planted about half a 
mile inside Israeli-controlled terri-
tory and went off as a patrol moved 
on a road near the border, check-
ing for explosives. One soldier was 
killed and two others were wound-
ed. 

In response. Israeli warplanes 
attacked in southern Lebanon for 
the first time since the May with-
drawal. striking what the army said 
were HezJ;>ollah poSitions. 

Witnesses said that the planes 
attacked near Kafr Shuba and 
that helicopter gunships raked 
the area with machine gun fi re. 
Israe li artillery also shelled what 
were described as Hezbollah tar-
gets.

ffiDAYrn~REMEMBRA CE 
World AIDS Day promotes 

education and remembrance 
of those who have passed 

away 
Currently, over 34 million people 

around the world have HIV or AIDS. 
Additionally, 8,000 people worldwide die 
from AIDS every day, according to the 
World AIDS Day Web site, 
http://www.worldaidsday.org 

"Figures like these make it seem like 
AIDS is winning; the site states. "But all 
over the world, people like you are mak-
ing a difference." 
. World AIDS Day, one of the most 
effective events that takes place in hopes 
of making a difference against AIDS, is 
held annually on Dec. 1. 

The day is dedicated to educating 
people about HIV and AIDS and recog-
nizing those individuals who have either 
died from the disease or are still living 
with it. The event continues to be the 
only coordinated international day of 
action against HIV and AIDS. 

The origins of World AIDS Day 
trace back to January of 1988, when the 
World Summit of Ministers of Hea lth 
on Programs for AIDS Prevention 
made a req uest to open channels of 
communication, strengthen the 
exchange of experience and informa-
tion, and forge a spirit of social toler-
ance. 

The organization wanted a more 
honest way of dealing with the new-
found AIDS epidemic and has succeed-
ed in this over the last 12 years. 

The proof is this: Since its inception, 
World AIDS Day has received tpe 
patronage of the United Nations and the 
World Health Assembly, as well as innu-
merable other countries, governments 
and individuals. 

Themes Throu~ tile Y .. , 
World AIDS Day has a particular 

theme for each year. "Communication" 
was the theme for its first year in 1988. 
Since then, more specific themes have 
been developed. In 1999, the theme, 
"Listen, Learn , Live: World AIDS 
Campaign with Children and Young 
People; stressed the importance of edu-
cating young adults on the dangers of 
AIDS. 

This year, the theme is "AIDS: Men 
Make a Difference." 

According to the World AIDS Day 
Web site, over 70 percent of HIV infec-
tions worldwide occur through sex 
between men and women, and a further 
10 percent through sex between men . 
Additionally, ano ther 5 percent occur 
among people who injec t drugs, 80 per-
cent of whom are men . The World AIDS 
Day campaign hopes that by bringing 
attention to men's roles in infection, 
awareness will be increased and, they 
feel, this may be the surest way to fight 
the AIDS epidemic. 
Student Health Advocate. 

World AIDS Day will be observed at 
UCSD on Thursday. The event is being 
coordinated by Debbie Pino;Saballett, 
the outreach coordinator for Student 
Health Services. 

"It's such an important event and vir-
tually every student knows somebody 
who has been affected by HfV," Pino-
Saballett said. "It 's a way for them to take 
an hour to show their support for con-
tinued HIV research for those who have

miss a great career opportunity. 
Marvelous riches could be yours on 
Wednesday, if you have the skills 
and do the work. Thursday and 
Friday you'll more than double

ContInued from pal. 10 
connection proves quite beneficial 
on Wednesday. Apply new infor-
mation and skills to streamline pro-
cedures at work Thursday. Ask for 
your reward on Friday. Don't wait 
to cash the check, either. By 
Saturday conditions for your pros-
perity aren't as favorable. 
Conversations with your mate are 
predicted for Sunday, but don't take 
yourselves too seriously. . 

Libra (Sept . 23·0ct. 23) 
Something you discover on 

Monday could change everything. 
Don 't JUSt sit there; go digging! 
Put your personal agenda on hold 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Thursday's good for entertaining 
at home. Friendship could turn 
into romance as the. evening pro-
gresses. Don't discuss finances on 
your date Friday night. Venture 
farther than usual with your 
sweetheart and/or the kids on 
Saturday. You 're in for a pleasant 
surprise. Stick close to home on 
Sunday. Relax and make plans. 

Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Watch for bargains and valu-

ables on Monday. That's a good 
day to mine for gold. Then, put 
what you find into savings on 
Tuesday. Otherwise, it may slip 
through your fingers. An older 
woman's comments could stir you 
up on Wednesday. Consider the 
consequences before taking 
action. Your mate or partner's got 
the good advice on Thursday, so 
listen . Avoid a misunderstanding 
by being respectful on Friday. 
Things don 't go quite as planned 
at your house on Saturday. Focus 
on love, not money, Sunday, and 

you'll wind up with plenty. 

IqItUrt •• (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
You're so creative Monday, you 

may surprise even yourself. Put 
your talent to good use on 
Tuesday and bring in much appre-
ciated extra income. Turn down 
friends who have expensive tastes 
on Wednesday. Take on more 
work instead and have even more 
in your pockets by Thursday. A 
temporary upset sends you back to 
the drawing board Friday. Do 
more reading on your own time 
Saturday and find the answer to 
the riddle. Hide out at home on 
Sunday for a private conversation. 

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
Information from private 

sources could be quite profitable 
Monday. You can find a bargain 
you might have missed othelwise. 
Don 't tell too much to a co-work-
er Tuesday or the boss on 
Wednesday. Wait until Thursday 
to take action, and you'll scoot 
past the competition. This could 
work in love, as well as business. 
Schedule a shopping trip instead 
of a date on Friday, and Saturday'S 
good for earning a bonus. A con-
versation on Sunday could lead to 
a change in your perspective. 
Don't be convinced of something 
that just ain't so. 
.miu. (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 

A meeting is full of surprises 
on Monday. Your creativity is 
much appreciated, as you come 
up with an idea no one else con-
sidered. You're under pressure 
Thesday, from friends as well as 
family. Everybody wants your 
attention, and yet you have big 
deadlines to meet! Postpone a trip 
on Wednesday so you can get 
everything done. Don't plan to go 
out on Thursday, either. You'll 
most likely be exhausted by then.

with a plan until Thursday, but 
that's fine. If you wait that long, 
you're more likely to succeed. A 
lot's going on behind closed doors 
on Friday. If you wait until

AIDS: 
Several awareness events

died as well as for those living with 
HIV." ' 

According to UCSD's Student 
Health News, Student Health 
Advocates is a program that pro-
vides students with special training 
as clin ic aides and peer educators. 
One of their many duties on cam-
pus is to provide sexual health 
information to the UCSD commu-
nity. They accomplish this in vari-
ous ways, including information 
sessions and programs on contra-
ception and sexually transmitted 
disease prevention. 

Pi no-Sa ballet feels that an event 
like World AJDS Day is extremely 
relevant to college students' lives. 

"For one thing, the majority of 
people affected by HIV are in the 
college-age population: Pino-
Saballett said. "The purpose of 
World AIDS Day is to acknowledge 
people who have died of AIDS and 
to increase awareness of HIY." 
UCID EYeIIts 

UCSD's events for World AJDS 
Day will be held in the Price Center 
and on Library Walk on Nov. 30. 
Pino-Saballett said the events will 
take place a day early because ~ey 
feared that a later date would bring 
about a lower turnout. With finals 
so close, organizers felt that 
Thursday would be better than 
Friday to maximize student partici-
pation. 

Activities begin at 9 a.m., start-
ing with the AJOS Quilt on the 
Price Center lawn. (In case of rain, 
this event will take place in 
Galleries A and B.) Students can 
view the quilt until 3 p.m. 

From 11 a.m. to noon in' the 
Price Center plaza, there will be a 
panel of speakers who are infected 

Monday, November 27, 2000 

with Hrv. Students will hear testi-
.monials from these speakers and 
have the opportunity to ask ques-
tions about AIDS and HlV. Those 
in attendance will also receive a 
free "condom rose." 

From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., there 
will be an HIV and AIDS resource 
fair on Library Walk. Students will 
be able to view art and poetry by 
children living with HIV. 
Temporary tattoos and free con-
dom roses will also be available. 

Other events will take place 
throughout the week at the Cross 
Cultural Center. The art and poetry 
will be on display in the gallery. In 
addition, an HIV- and AIDS- relat-
ed (Ilovie will . be shown at the 
Cross Cultural Center on Nov. 30 
from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. 

World AIDS Day is co-spon-
sored by the A.S. Council and is a 
joint program by the Cross 
Cu ltural Center, the ' Women's 
Center, the AIDS Research 
Institute, Student Health Services 
and Student Health Advocates.

I ncase any of you have not noticed; there are only 27 shopping days left until 
Christmas. If this means anything to 
you, plea~ remove this newspaper 
from your gloved mitts and go back 
to discussing the new Abercrombie 
and Fitch catalogue on your voice-
activated; internet-surfable, metallic-
colored cell phone. You clearly have 
nothing of substance in your life and 
are thus incapable of heartfelt reflec-
tion. Heartfelt retlection is what this 
time of year is all about, and those of 
us with souls take this opportunity 
to reminisce over the wondrous 
components that comprise our lives. 

Here in San Diego, there is much 
to be thankful for, as we are among 
the luckiest of the lucky to be not 
only smart enough to get into a 
high-faluting institution of knowl-
edge endowment like UCSD, but 
alsc wise enough to choose a place 
where we can still drive our car to 
school (or the local tavern) without 
shoveling heaps and heaps of snow.

UCSD Men's 
Basketball Falls 
To Cal Poly 
Mustangs too much 
for Tritons, hands 
UCSD a second loss 
., IIOBDI' FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team faced another tough oppo-
nent last Monday when it squared 
off on the road against Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo. 

The Mustangs gave the Thtons 
more than they could handle, win-
ning 89-67. 

UCSD did make it a game early 
on, down only 10-9 after a pair of 
Sam Higgins' three-pointers. Later, 
the Thtons' Cole Miller hit a three-
pointer to give his team a 17-16 
lead. 

[t was all Cal Poly after that. 
The Mustangs went up 45-30 at 

halftime and led .by as much as 25 
at one point. The Tritons did rally 
back to pull to within 13 points. 
but that would be as close as they 
would get en route to the loss. 

Cameron Jackson led UCSD 
with 18 points and four assists. 
Higgins chipped in with 14 points 
and Miller finished with 12 points 
and five rebounds. 

The Mustangs .spol1ed four 
players scoring in double-digits, 
including Scott Jamaill with 20. 

The win was the first game of 
the year for Cal Poly, while the loss 
made UCSD fall to 0-2.

PORTS 
HfRf Wt ARfN'l NOW, fNHRTAIN US 

~ .... ·ao TRITONSI 
By TAIT MILLO 
Associate Sports Editor 

The role of athletics, as associ-
ated with school spirit, should be 
one of importance. That is not to 
say sports should be of more 
importance than academics ' or 
quality of life at the school attend-
ed, but it should be of some 
imporunce. 

UCSD boasts a top-notch ath-
letic program, full of national 
champions and All-Americans, 
and with its move to Division II, 
the Tritons are showing that they 
have no problem adjusting to the 
new level of competition and that 
they will continue to produce A-
list athletic teams. 

I f both these assertions are to 
be believed, then the question 
must be posed, where do athletics 
stand in relation to school spirit at 
UCSD? The answer to this ques-
tion is simple: There's no relation . 

Triton Assistant Athletic Direc-
tor Ken Grosse said "Athletics do 
not playas much of a role in 
school spirit as we, meaning the 
athletic department, wish it 
would." 

Athletics, outside of the athlet-
ic community at UCSD, plays no 
role. in the UCSD student body's 
conception of itself as Tritons. 

"As an athlete on the volleyball 
team, the other guys on the team 
and [ make an effort to go out and 
suPPOrt the other teams," said 
Marshall sophomore Bill O'Con-
nor. "For instance, we went to the 
State game last week. I just don't 
see that effort from most students 
here at UCSD." 

If athletics play little or no role 
in school spirit, then what forms 
the core of a Triton? 

It seems as if the focus of the 
administration at UCSD is on the 
academic aspect of st.udent life. 
This creates an atmosphere in 

David Dunbar Has 
Made His Mark 
Cross coun.try runner ends an excellent 
season with a strong showing at nationals 
., ISAAC PlAllLMAN ners from abOut 400 Division II 
Staff Writer schools. To top it all off, Dunbar 

When cross country head 
coach Ted Van Arsdale was look-
ing at recruits for last year's 
squad, one local athlete in par-
ticular caught his eye. 

"[ thought [David Dunbar) 
would be advantageous to the 
school," Van Arsdale said. 

Dunbar was enthusiastic to 
come to UCSD. 

"[ really liked the area and I 
really like the coach," Dunbar 
said. "[ knew a number of guys 
on the team and [ knew the pro-
gram here was strong." 

Fast forward to this year and 
Van Arsdale looks like a genius. 

Dunbar recently became the 
first male in UCSD history to 
make it to nationals for the Th-
tons in Division II. His time of 
33:19 placed him 52nd out of 
over 90 runners and ninth 
among West Region runners. 

What makes this achieve-
ment even more commendable 
is that the national champi-
onship is tomprised of top run~ 

is only a sophomore. 
"By the time [Dunbar) is 

gone, he'll have established him-
self with the other running leg-
ends from UCSD,· Van Arsdale 
said. 

Dunbar appears to be well on 
his way to doing just that. 

"I just liked running," he said 
of his decision to join his high 
school's cross country team five 
years ago. "And [ was good at it. 
lt was fun ." 

Coming into this season, 
Dunbar set three goals for him-
self: to place in the top 15 at the 
conference championships, to be 
named All-Region, and to make 
nationals. 

A good performance in 
nationals assures strong consid-
eration for All-Region honors. 
Dunbar came in 16th in confer-
ence, just short of his goal, but 
still respectable considering he 
ran while he was ill. 

"[t was a big race; we have a 

• Set .... ., pagt fj . 

which it is very hard for students 
to come together outside of the 
stressful arena of the quarter sys-
tem. 

There seems to be an invasive 
malaise that has seeped into the 
very pores of this La Jolla campus 
that makes it impossible to have 
fun while attending school here. 

Is it really impossible, are class-
es that hard, or is the studen t body 
just apathetic? 

Now, going to a basketball 
game or a water polo game is not a 
cure-all for this elusive malaise, 
.but at the same time, it does give 
students something !O do and it 
brings students together in a com-
munity that fosters unity. 

There is a purpose to being at 
that game and the purpose is to 
cheer on UCSD, to support YOUR 
school. 

"Athletic events create a criti-
cal mass, a place where students 
can be brought together," said 

Sl<y Frostensoo/ Guardian 

men's basketball coach Greg 
Lanthier. "Bringing students 
together is what creates school 
spirit. The chance to become a 
part of this campus is there and is 
provided for students. All they 
have to do is get up and take 
advantage of it." 

Why sit around and complain 
about how boring life is as a Tri-
ton, as many UCSD students have 
been known to do, when there are 
usually between one and four 
home games a week featuring one 
or more of UCSD's 23 NCAA 
teams? 

One group that certainly does 
care about Triton athletics is the 
pep band. 

The pep band is made up com-
pletely of volunteers, as opposed 
to most schools of comparable 
size and athletic stature, where the 
band is fully funded by the music

UCSD ~Cycling Team 
Wins Home Event 
Squad dominates event at home last 
week, racking up nearly 300 points 
By TAlI MIWII 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD cycling team host-
ed a race on the par course behind 
RlMAC on Nov. 19, and won by 
scoring 298 points. I 

The weather held true for the 
race while UCSD faced San Diego 
State University, Chico State, Cal 
Poly San Louis Obispo, Stanford, 
and Cuesta Community College. 

The race featured two events. 
The first was a one-lap time trial 
and the second a short-track cross 
country competition. Each event 
was then divided into five races: 
men's A, Band C, and women's A 
and B. Race director Pete Knudsen 
was in charge of controlling and 
setting up this grandiose race. 

"[t was a lot of work setting up 
the race, but [ had some help, and 
it was worth . it," Knudsen said. 
"When you get six teams together 
and have a good turnout like we 
did here, and when the team per-
forms well, it makes the race fun." 

Knudsen also panicipated in 
the men's A division race and 
helped teed UCSO to wi." in -both 

the time trial and the cross coun-
try race. 

He placed first in the time trial 
and was one of four riders to break 
the course record, which he previ-
ously held. Knudsen finished with 
a time of 6:28 and was closely fol -
lowed by Jesse Beck, also of 
UCSD. who finished in 6:29. The 
last two riders to break the old 
course record were Anthony 
Medaglia of SLO at 6:35 and Eric 
Wicker of SDSU at 6:43. 

The men's team continued its 
cycling dominance in the Band C 
divisions of the time trial event. 
Eric Mellers won the men's B in a 
time of 7:13, just edging Gerry 
Elbert of SDSU in what was a 
mad-dash finish. 

[n the C division, UCSD cap-
tured three of the top four spots 
and was led by Brian Flock, who 
finished first in a time of 7:27. 
Flock destroyed the rest of the 
field as the second place finisher, 
Eric Hermawan from SDSU, 
clocked in at a distant 8:00.

department and is offered as an 
actual class. 

Even though they are volun-
teers, the band still manages to 

mak\!'~~ to at least one game~ week , 
where they play anything from jazz 
to rock to pep band classics like 
"Louie Louie." 

The pep band makes a deliber· 
ate decision to go to the games, and 
the student body could do the 
same thi ng, so why don't they? 

. For some, the choice to go or 
not to go is hamstrung by their 
schoolwork. 

"l would lov!! to check. out a . 
basketball game or go to a soccer 
mafch," said Muir freshmlln Kirk 
Miller. "But hal,f ,the time I'm either 
too tired or too busy with a job and 
schoolwork to go: " . 

However, this is not the only 
reason students don't go to the 
games. For many, sports are 
obscured in anonymity. 

"Most of the time I just don't 
hear about the games. If the 
advertising for the games was bet-
ter, and I knew when and where 
they were, I would definitely show 
more often." said Roosevelt junior 
Adam Taylor. 

The move to Division II could 
alleviate this problem. 

"in the CCAA, WI. play double-

headers and it makes it much eas-
ier to advertise and much more 
spectator-friendly since in Divi-
sion Ill , many of our games were 
played during the break," Grosse 
said. 

Athletics can offer an outlet for 
the stude{lt body, and it can help 
form UCSD's vision of itself. 
Events present times and places fo r 
students to come together and, if 
even just for the hour it takes to 
playa water polo match, feel like 
they are part of something more 
than a study group for their Chern 
6A class. 

How to make this happen is a 
hard question to answer, but the 
tools are there. We have a great 
athletic progra.m and students 
who want to get out and be a part 
of something, but do students 
want athletics to be that some-
thing? 

UCSD cyclist Pete Knudsen 
said "One of the reasons I came to 
UCSD was because we didn't have 
the rah-rah attitude of other 
schools, and I like the balance we 
strike here between athletics and 
academics." 

Students need to realize that 
UCSD is lacking in school spirit. 

In order to make this campus a 
better place to go to school and in 
order to foster a sense of school 
spirit and unity, both the students 
and the administration need to let 
athletics or another aspect of cam-
pus life rise up and become equals 
with that masterful slave-driver, 
academia.

pretty big rivalry with the other

bar said. "I just took one for the

Van Arsdale sees Dunbar as 
more than just a physical speci-
men. 

"His mentally competitive atti-
tude is an important strength, W Van 
Arsdale said. ·He has the desire to 
sec how good he can be. W 

Dunbar's determination is lln 
example for the other runners, 
including his younger brother, 
Jonathon. 

"He's shown the way [for the 
young runners l." Van Arsdale 
said. 

Dunbar down plays his leader-
ship role to his brother. ·1 help 
him out a Iittie,w he said. ·But 
usually I let him do his own 
things.w 

He is also modest about his 
championship run. "I think it was 
pretty good, although I wanted to 
run a little faster, W he said. 

Van Arsdale has a different 
impression. 

"He was absolutely fantastic at

Column: 
Boras attempting 
to "destroy" pastime 
c ... . d .......... l. 
There. are many people in the world 
who would sacrifice one of their 
more valuable limbs for just a glim-
mer of our pleasant SD paradise. 

I spent last Thanksgiving in 
S'Oll1e cold Parisian pub tucked 
away in the hulking shadows of the 
Eiffel Tower, with only a few other 
Americans with whom to share my 
plight. As our families back home 
feasted on succulent turkey with all 
the flavorful trimmings, warm, 
moist mashed potatoes and ears of 
corn glistening with butter, we sat 
and drank . wann beer on uncom-
fortable bar stools, with a bunch of 
non-American freaks frolicking 
about' us 'prattling on in their 
ridiculous tongues. 

It was about that moment when I 
realized America is beautiful. 
Despite its many and varied flaws, 
America ntles, and those wacky for-
eign people, obsessed with snooty 
cricket and riot-inducing soccer, can 
all just bow down and prostrate 
themselves before our mighty 
nation. No matter how many chads 
are impregnated or ballots vomited 
on, there is nothing that can shake 
my faith in our grand system. 

At least there wasn't until I 
op.=ned the sports s.:ction a week 
or so back and read about how the 
devil, known above ground as 
agent Scott Boras. was attempting 
to destroy our beloved American 
pastime. He was demanding, on 
behalf of his client, superstar short-
stop Alex Rodriguez, numerous 
and extravagant luxuries, the likes 
of which have never been fathomed 
by mere man, all in exchange for 
Rodriqucz's baseball-playing ser-
vices. The list of demands included 
private jets, office buildings and an 
island chain in the South Pacific. 

Of course, this was in addition 
to the $20 million or so in salary 
that this cretin phlls down each 
season. All to · play a wondrous 
game, a game that makes me proud 
to salute the red. wl:ite and blue. 

As I frlI retchmg and lrembling 
to the floor, I realized that our 
nation, which is set apart from all 
other by this grand game, is Icsing 
its grip, with dictator-like players 
overrunning the game in a quest 
for land and riches. With mongrelS 
like that dbminatinr our grand old 
pastime, maybe it'~ tilne to break 
out the wickets and bowl us a 
cricket match. Cheers! 

race.-

They both attribute Dunbar's 
performan~e to ~ grueling train-
mg plan, In whtch Dunbar ran 
over 80 miles per week from the 
beginning of summer until late 
October. 

·The difference between this 
)'Car and last year is a result of 
[Dunbar! sticking to the training 
plan,· Van Arsdale said. "It allowed 
him to complete the season 
strong.w 

This was vital, since this was 
Dunbar's first year in Division II 
and his first year of running 10,000 
meters. Division III meets were 
only 8,000 meters. 

Dunbar is far from finished. 
Next year, his goals are to finish 
higher in nationals, as well as 
make the Division II All-American 
team. He has started to train for 
the track team, in which he com-
petes in the 1,SOO-meter and 
S,OOO-mcter races, as well as the -
steeplechase. 

·My main goal is to make it to 
nationals. whicn is harder in track,· 
Dunbar said. 

Dunbar has no intention of 
slowing down after school, either. 
"I'll definitely be running after col-
lege,· he said. . 

"He's a hardcore runner,· Van 
Arsdale said. 

For Dunbar, there appears to be 
no end in sight and that seems to 
be just fine with him.

Ca ............ 11 
able to field ·a time trial in the A or 
8 squad. 

Howcver. 1liton Sara Peetz did 
take the women's B cross country 
race over Kim K1emintowski from 
Chico. 

The nitons outclassed the 
opposition in the cross country 
race as weD as the time trial. 

·AJ a team, we performed 
incredibly well,· Knudsen said. 
"Even though the event used an 
outdated scoring system, which 
favored participation over place. 
we still won six of the 10 races. W 

UCSD won ~ery event it 
entered except the men's C team 
short-track. 

Mark Lunden of SDSU won 

that, but the nitons captured the 
next three spots in the race to 
assure them of an overwhelming 
victory, 

• E vcryone was exci ted to have 
a race at home and I think we 
came out and showed that by per-
forming the way we did," Knudsen 
said. 

In the short-track, the same 
two A-team riders captured the 
top two spots. 

The only difference was that 
Knudsen and Beck switched 
places as Beck captured first and 
Knudsen second. Dirk Van 
Vlden also had a strong perfor-
mance for the Thtons, placing

out by winning the men's C time 
trial by a mile, finished second in 
the men's C cross country to an 
energized Mark Ludin of SDSU. 

Team president Jason Gold-
berg placed a solid fourth in both 
the time trial and short track B 
division. 

The winner of each race, 
instead of being presented with 
medals, was given tropical plants 
and propeller guns. 

"We just tried to make things a 
little bit more relaxed out there, 
and besides, wouldn't you rather 
have a propeller gun or cool plant 
than a dinky medal?" Knudsen 
said . 

As it goes, the team performed 
well and the event as a whole was 
a success. 

"Everything worked out." 
Knudsen said. "We had generally 
fast times and overall the event 
was satisfactory. I think most peo-
ple enjoyed themselves out there."
