Accreditation teatn crit'icizes

A n.od of approval will mean a five-year

federal finan ial aid . 

The W ASC report appeared mo t concern d

university, which it sugge t d wa 
incompatible with th departmental aspect of 
the campus. 

It also focused upon UCSD' v re attritIOn

Another student concern that was

The announcement that

that the nomination was 
made to a search committee

Why can't we try 
to rem em ber George? 
Editor: 

The present controversy 
over the erection of a plaque 
for George Winne forced me 
to do some thinking and then 
write this letter. For those 
who don 't ' know George 
Winne set fire to himself on 
Reve\1e Plaza as a protest 
against the Vietnam War. 

I am not here to ar~e his 
politics or to try and dIscover 
why he thought his suicide 

' would help the anti-war 
movement. The fact of the 
matter is, for some reason 
known only to him, George 
felt the cause he was fighting 
for was worth more than his 
own life. To outsiders, his 
death seemed' senseless and 
did not attain anything more 
than sensational headlines, 
but to GeoTl~e, and others like 
him, it was Just something he 
had to do to satisfy his 
conscience_ While neither 

~eeing with his politics nor 
hIs methods, George was a 
man of principles and 
convictions and should be 
remembered for adhering to 
them to the end. 

What is the problem then? 
Simply worded, George was 
not the only student to die 
because of the Vietnam War. 
There were 50,000 American 
men killed in Vietnam, and 
thousands more were 
wounded. A\1 these men were 
killed or wounded doing 
exactly what George Winne 
was doing - fighting for 
something they believed in. 
Outsiders do not know why 

they went; they just did. 
Their cause was just as futile 
a Mr. Winne's; 50,000 died , 
and nothing was accom-
plished . And yet, I hear no 
clamor for justice and no 
rallies for a memorial plaque 
to these men. 

This is a problem that I've 
seen more often than I'd like 
to at UCSD - the prevalent 
.theory that left is right and 
right is wrong. Why should 
50,000 young men be ignored 
simply because they were on 
the side of the establishment? 
Isn't this tunnel vision, 
which prevents the plaque 
organizers from seeing people 
with views other than their 
own, the same sort of ocular 
impairment of which they 
accuse the school admini-
stration? 

Students here pride 
themselve s as being 
intellectuals with the 
capability of looking at an 
issue objectively and then 
making a stand. Why can't 
they ignore politics for once 
and simply provide a 
memorial to all men and 
women who had the courage 
and self-esteem to fight to the 
end for what they believed? 

In short, if a plaque needs 
to be erected, let it not bejust 
for George Winne but for all 
who died during that 
tumultuous period, fighting 
and dying for what they 
believed.

Don't be a Janet Cooke: 
keep reSUnles truthful 

LOS ANGELES - A 
Pulitzer Prize-winning 
newspaper recently dis-
charged a reporter who'd 
done it. Yet thousands of 
other well-meaning college 
graduates and ' summer job-
seekers are ignoring the 
lesson of Janet Cooke and 
falsifying their resumes. 

Crafting a resume with 
spurious qualifications has 
become a popular way to 
catch an employer's eye. 

Although a minority of job-
seekers fabricate t ir entire 
life histories, far too many 

exaggerate their records. 
In her resume, 26-year-old 

reporter Cooke told the 
Washington Post that she'd 
graduated magna cum laude 
from Vassar College and held 
a master's degree from the 
University of Toledo. In 
reality, Ms. Cooke attended 
Vassar for her freshman year 
and graduated with a B.A. 
from Toledo. 

Unfortunately, lying on 
resumes is a cinch. And it's 
only getting easier with the 
proliferation of professional 
resume writers, who make no 
secret of their popularity_ 

make no mistake about it. 
Everyone loses in the 
process. 

The job applicants with 
s imilar records may be 
judged differently because 
one claims to have studied 
French at the Sorbonne -
not at Valley State . 
Regardless of the truth, the 
better-looking resume wins 
its owner an interview, while 
the other applicant's is filed . 

Leave the squirrels alone 
Resume writing services 

now fill two pages of the 
Washington, D.C., Yellow 
Pages. They're not cheap.

Those trapped in the 
conti nual process of 
misrepresentation also don't 
realize its long-ter m 
consequence . They even-
tually can't tell the difference 
between right and wrong. 

"Tho e who undertake to 
tell white lies should look for 
alternatives," wrote Sissels 
Bok in Lying_ "They should 
see even these lies as links in 
much .wider practices and 
should know the ways in 
which these practices can 

'spread. "

I would like to address a

Institution of Oceanography 
has earned a worldwide 
reputation as a champion of 
marine conservation and 
research. It is prominently 
poised on the bluffs of La Jolla 
Shore , attracting scores of 
visitors daily. It' s these very 
people who enjoy the scenic 
tranquility of Scripps, 
including the friendly antics 
of the theatrical quirrels. 
Many family albums are

It has been brought to my

Editor: 

It seems absurd that the 
folks who hate nuclear power 
run around defacing all our 
property_ If they could just 
take a second tothink, maybe 
they could set a good example 
of a clean way of life.

metal and non-metals is too

Profess ional re s ume 
writers are not hired liars, 
we're told. But proprietors 
conceded that students don 't

job.

Wi th only a 3D-minute 
interview, professional 
resume writer can make the 
backgrounds of ordinary 
people seem like Winston 
Churchill's. 

Undoubtedly resume-
writers practice their art 
with the tacit approval of 
their customers. Anxious job-
seekers are likely to go along 
with any em belli hments 
that st rengthen their 
resume. If your cou in , for 
example, work ' for a state 
legi s lator , your resume 
would naturally note that 
you had advised the

It's difficult for resume

The epidemic of falsehoods 
that has pread throughout 
the journalism community is 
also infecting the business

half the resu me he ees

If profe s ional re ume-
writing services become the 
natural fir ·t step after 
leaving school , all resumes 
will soon lose their value. Are 
we headed for the day when 
these piece of paper will 
have to be notarized? 

The Washington Post is 
already tightening its 
personnel procedures in 
re ponse to the Janet Cooke 
fiasco. It will probably oon 
add a "resume bouncer" on 
the newsroom floor to certify 
potential employees' back-
grounds. 

No doubt major businesses 
and coIlege career planning ·

steps, too. 

But what happens to less

Accreditation reports critical •. A/riCil diplomat 
inSD 

continued from page 1 
period. 

But few officials at UCSD believe such 
a reversal could occur. 

"There's no doubt in my mind that 
they will renew us for five years." 
commented Wayne Gray, a university 
planner who helped to co-ordinate the 
accreditation team's visit. 

Explaining that the univer ity i 
generally highly regarded by WASC, 
Gray said that the review was intended to 
serve as a learning device more than "a 
kind of audit." 

However, the WASC committee was 
especially critical of UCSD's response to 
its 1977 accreditation review. 

A summary of the university's efforts 
to improve many noted deficiencies 
during the 19'n visit - contained in a 
UCSD "self study report" - was called 
"little more than a n assembly of 
unevaluated and often off· hand and 
undocumen ted assertions ... " 

Gray, who produced the report, said he 
was "surprised" by the committee's 
harsh criticism, but admitted that the 
report could have been better if he had 
more time. 

Gray and other administrators were 
s urprised, as well, by t he negative tenor 
of the report. 

"We thought our exit interview (during 
which the chancellor and his associates 
met with the accreditation team) went so 
well," Gray said. 

Gray attributed this in part to the 
committee's "time restraint' in drawing 
up its report . 

"It looks like it was hastily done," Gray 
said of the report. "Still, I think that 
through their visit and the knowledge 
that they gained (it) was a remarkably 
good job." 

Now that the WASC committee has 
issued its final report, the next move is up 
to UCSD. Before a WASC enior 
commission reviews the report next 
month. the university must study the 

report and ubmit it respon 'e to the 
commission. 

Chancellor Atkinson, who will is ue 
the response. has not yet read the report 
in detail and would not comment on it, a 
spokes per on from his office said 
yesterday. 

The following is a summary of the 
accreditation team' findings during 
their February visit: 

Four·college system: The W ASC report 
noted that, whi le the university's four 

. colleges have remained nearly constant in 
terms of structure, its departmental 
administration "has been continuously 
developed and strengthened." The result , 
according to the report, is "a relatively 
conventional structure for a 
com prehens i ve, research ·orient ed 
university. " 

However, the report called the e two 
structures "two significantly different 
institutional models for living. learning 
and achieving." 

Calling them two "competing 
mystiques." the report asserted that the 
departmental structure prompts effort 
to become an "elite research university" 
at UCSD and focuses upon "scholarly 
specialization, discipline and 
department, the laboratory , research and 
publication. " 

UCSD's four-college system (originally 
projected to expand to 12 colleges)

"These variants, while not mutually

undergraduate education in the colleges, 
UCSD appear ' to fall short of evoking the 
identification. loyalty and satisfaction 
with quality of life which are the 
hallmark of the elite libe~ arts colleges 
with which Revelle, Muir, Third and 
Warren Colleges are pre 'umably to be 
analogized . " 

R eten tion deficien cies - Tied 
closely to thi last statement i UCSD' 
"strikingly high" attrition rate, which 
the report claimed lead to "academic 
inefficiency" in institutional terms and to 
"the loss in human terms" of s tudents 
who leave the university. 

" Quantitative evidence that the 
undergraduate student at UCSD may be 
disenchanted with what superficially 
would appear to be a highly attractive 
environment i present in the data on 
student entry and retention ," the report 
noted. 

"Indeed, almost everyone with whom 
thi . matter was discussed had a different 
explanation," the report continued. A a 
result, accreditation team members came 
up with few ideas on how to improve 
retention . 

However, the WASC report was careful 
to tress the eriousne of UCSD's 
retention problem. "Undergraduate 
student discontent does not lie very far 
beneath the surface of a relatively placid 
campus," the report noted . "A common 
undercurrent is the assert ion of 
implication ... (that) This place is run by 
the faculty for research and graduate 
study, and the undergraduate gets the 

hort end of everything. '" 
The report concluded that "a 

determinedly analytic and comprehen-
s ive inquiry into student attrition, 
alumni sat isfaction and perceived (italics 
original) qualit y of undergraduate 
student life should be undertaken 
without delay."

Bill to

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramento Co~rcspondent 

A.fter inte'nse lobbying by 
Umversity officials, a 
propo al to include the UC 
Board of Regent and 
academic enate under a stiff 
tate "open meeting" law 

wa ! illed Tuesday by a 
Senate committee. 

On a vote of 5·3, the 
Governmental Organization 
Committee squelched 
Senator Barry Keene's 
controversial legislation, S8 
252, which wou ld have 
included the Regents under 
the .State Agency Open 
MeetIng Law limiting a 
public body's right to meet in 
secret. 

After the hearings, Keene 
vowed to bring the bill back 
next year. 

"UC's position is outra-
geous," said Keene, a 
Democrat who repre ent the 
north coast. "The Regents 
have been granted a great 
tru t by the people of the 
stale and have no more 
bu ine meeting in ecret 
than anyone el e." 

At present , the University 
of California i granted it 
own special ection of the 
Education Code exempting

Get in on solvins your own 
problems ••• 
~------------------- applications at AS office and campus libraries. ----

Food and Housing 
Advisory Board 

An issue of fundamental concern to most 
students is the lack of affordable housing in 
the campus area. This San Diego campus 
currently has the highest reates for 
undergraduate housing in the U.c. system. 
Furthermore, a recent study requested by the 
Regents showed that only two campuses 
charged their students higher than "fair 
market value" rental rates. San Diego holds 
the dubious distinction of being one of these 
two. This means it's cheaper to live off 
campus than in the on campus apartments. 
Despite this fact, campus rents {Ie once again' 
skyrocketing to an all time high for the 1981 -
82 school year. Too bad rent control didn't 
pttSS! 

We're looking for an active, knowledgable 
person to represent us on the Food and 
Ho .... " AcMIOI'y Ioird, in the hopes that 
we can advise the Administration as to what 
kind of housing we need, and what we are 
willing to p<rf. A couple of promising 
alternatives we've begun to explore are 
cooperative housing and sorority/fraternity 
housing, along with the possibil ity of less 
"luxurious" apartments with provisions for 
smaller, single rooms. If you'd like to get 

. irrvolved and keep the ball rolling, here's a 
great opportunity! 

Call1pul/Comlllunity 
'lannlng 

If you'd like to take the housing struggle to 
the streets, the campus/Community 
Planning Committee is the place for you. 
This committee deals with issues relevant to 
the interrelation of the U.c. campus and the 
local communty. The prospect of a "student 
oriented" shopping mall was dealt with on 
this committee. We noN have La Jolla Village 
Square - though we suppose some 
students can afford to shop and Bullock's 
Wilshire, and make their jewelry acquisitions 
at Black Starr & Frost ... Consideration of the 
Stable Lands is now of fundamental concern 
to this committee. Will the land be sold to a 
developer for the type of expensive, si.ngle 
family dwellings which now exist in the area? 
Will the money from such a sale be used to 
offset the outrageous cost of housing on this 
campus? Well, let's get your opinion. 

Program Review 
Commillce 

Lack of funding is a great problem not only 
for student services and actMties, but for the 
campus in general as well. The ~eds of 
instructional research and public service 
programs, as well as supporting programs 
such as academic computing and libraries, 
must be prioritized in order to properly 
allocate operating budgets and capital 
improvement resources. The responsibility 
for this arduous task falls on the Program 
RevIew Commttta. We, the undergraduates 
as UCSD, get one and only one representative 
to voice our concerns to this committee. We 
are looking for a well-informed student, with 
about ten hours per week available to serve 
on the Program Review Committee. If this 
description fits you, come see us right away. 

Where Docs Your Money Go? 
Communications 

Board 
Various campus media are also funded by 

these activity fees. We currently have several 
journals and alternative newspapers which 
CCNer political, technical and ethnic issues, 
and offer students an opportunity to publish 
creative writing and articles with critical 
insight .i nto current events . The 
Communlcltlonl Board wi II be very busy 
during these next few weeks trying to 
adequately fund our media, but the first step 
is to get the board appointed. If you have 
some knowledge of the media, or are 
interested in learning, perhaps this is the 
position for you! 

Committee on 
leIucatlonal Policy 

and Executive Policy 
Committee 

Interested in the academic side of things? 
Perhaps you can find a place on the 
Committee on Educational Policy, which 
makes recommendations to the Academic 
Senate on such matters as the incomplete 
policy or changes in the drop date for class 
withdrawals. Perhaps the Executive Policy 
Committee would be best for you. This 
committee makes decisions for the 
Academic Senate when they fail to reach 
quorum (which they almost never do). 
Students have no voting rights on these 
committees, but with well-informed and 
articulate students in these positions, we 
cannot be ignored. At least they w ill know if 
we are unhappy with having to drop classes 
in the fourth week before they, the faculty, 
can get our first exam back to us. Due to the 
nature of the decisions involved, students on 
these committees are required to do a great 
deal of research into the issues. The time 
commitment here can exceed ten hours per 
week, so be sure you know what you're 
getting into ... 

If you don't have quite as much free time as 
the above committees require, we 
understand. We're all students here with 
masses of classes to pass. There are seldom 
any tangible rewards for participation in 
student governmen~ academic credit being 
at the discretion 0 fthe Academic Senate, 
and stipend money being virtually non-
existent Don't despair! You can still explore 
new horizons, make new friends, deal with 
new frustrations, ' and get a taste of the real 
world right here at UCSD! Even if you only 
have a couple of extra hours per week, you 
can become a productive member of an AS 
commission. If you're interested in working in 
any of the followi ng areas, just contact the AS 
commissioner involved at 452-4550, or get 
your application up to the AS offices. 

Reg Fcc Committee 
Have you ever wondered what is funded 

by the fees you pay each quarter? The largest 
amount is spent on "student services" which 
include the Student Health Center, Career 
Planning and Placement, Legal Services, 
Counseling and Psychological Services, 
Recreational and Intercollegiate Athletics, 
and a variety of other programs which the 
state's legislators have deemed to be outside 
the realm of educational necessities. If the 
students want them, the students must pay 
for them. Who decides whether or not the 
students want these services? Good 
question! Surely the students make these 
decisions .. .well, not quite, but we do have 
some input. The Registration Fcc 
Comrnlttct, made up of just over half 
students, along with administrative and staff 
personnel, is advisory to the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs in these matters. This 
committee is the only mechanism we have to 
ensure that our Reg Fees are spent wisely. If 
you're interested in serving on the 
Registration Fee Committee, and can find an 
extra twelve hours per week, please apply! 

Student Center Board 
The Student Center BOII'd, make up of 

student representatives from each of the 
colleges, the AS, SAAC, the co-ops and 
enterprises, . and the Graduate Student 
Council, also receives a large chunk of your 
money. They are responsible for maintenance 
of the Student Center, along with 
programming and funding for such things as 
activities at the Pub and the Che Cafe, 
equipment for co-ops and enterprises, and 
services such as EDNA. Although they are 
under the auspices of the Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs, the Student Center Board is 
one of the few committees made up solely of 
students that has actual money to work with. 
Again, this is your money, folks - here's an 
opportunity to see that it's well spent! 

Activity Fcc Board 
Some of your fees filter down to the 

Associated Students. The programs funded 
by these activity fees are numerous and 
varied. Speakers, movies, bands and 
operational budgets for Student 
Organizations are just a few examples of 
what this money is used for. Since there is 
never quite enough to go around, the 
ActIvIty Fcc IoIrd must decide who gets 
what and who gets cut. The busiest part of 
the year is now and in the Fal l. We have 
immediate openings on the Activity Fee 
Board that you can fill - get that application

The .Iues Irotllcn: This is 

supposed to be a comedy, but this 
John landis film fails on that le:III'!l. 
landis'last film, "Animal House," was a 
baudy, truly hilarious thing to behold. 
Not this time around. landis seems to 
be a chi Id with too many toys, too many 
cop CcYS to destroy, too rMny dollars to 
play with. He Should have stuck with a 
ICM' budget. Even John Belushi and Dan 
Ackroyd can't rise abcNe the muck Bu~ 
on another leIII'!l, this is a classic, a 
collection of worderful blues songs by 
major artists. They include Aretha 
Franklin, Jomes BrO'Nn, John Lee Hooker 
ard Ray Charles. not to mention the 
Blues Brothers' brilliant backup band. 
So. go to see this mcl\lie for the music. 
not for the boorish humor. 

Popcye: Robert Altman's original 
decision to make a II'Ve-action mCNie 
with the "Popeye:" character seemed 
strarse. A fter all, the baddest sailor man 
of them all has been a smasn success in 
animation and the comic strips. But it's 
rot easy to make the jump from 
cartQ0r5 to "real life." Some'flow or 
other. though, Altman pulled It 011. thiS 
mcl\lie has ~ ott-thewall' whimsical air 
that characterized the best of the old 
FleiSher Studioclrtooos. RobinWiliiams 
IS incorrigible and Incomprehensible as 
Popeye, the man on a quest to find his 
lars lost pappy. Shelley Duvall is 
clumsy and lo.oeable as Olive 0r'I. They. 

~Iors with the other actOlS -
especially the loorlles lur1<irs in the 
deep backgrounds - -give the mcNie 
the wierd, mythic quality It needs, 

IT. OUT 
Atlentic CIty: When this tale of lost 

dreams and frustrMions in the gambling 
mecca of the Atlantic seaboc!rd ended, 
I realized thot I had enjoyed it. But I 
wasn't sure -M1y. People do things for 
little discemable reason. Scenes cut to 
and fro without logical pattern. But, still, 
it was nice. Diredor Louis Malle has 
constructed a mcNie that is at once a 
satire on the plastic madness that is 
Atlant ic City and a sympathetiC look 
into the dreams of the city's inhabitants. 
Susan Sarandon Is brill iant, as alW"YS, in 
her role as a young woman who wants 
to become a professional card dealer 
and deal her way to Europe. Burt 
lancaster is equally fine as an old minor 
league thug playing out the string as a 
hoUse servant to a bed-ridden old 
glamour queen. Whatever the reason. 
the mcNie is worth seeing. 

Mig'" tMwkI: At first glance this 
looks to bejustandhercop flick, where 
the tough but straight-laced good guys 
battle through inertia and bureaucracy 
to finally knock dCM'n the vicious bad 
guys- Well, the bad guys are 
stereotyped to the finger tips - a 

mea~d terrorist and his pS)Cho 
girlfrierd. But ~ good guys are a notch 
above the ordinary - and you get the 
feeling that de\ll'!loprnent has more to 
do with the actOlS than with the 
storyline. Sylvester StallClrlf: is perfedly 
believable as the Vietnam War vet-
turned·New York cop. Billy Dee 
Williams, despite a very limited 
charader. is equally fun to observe as 
Stallone's partner. They make the 
audience really care who wins - the 
cops or the terrorists. 

~II!J lull: Robert DeNire d id the 
near-impossible in this movie - he 
played an utterly unlikeable lead 
charader and drew people in by the 
trucldoad to see him. Jake LaMotta. the 
old boXlrs champ, is loud and rude 
and nasty and childlike. as much a lout 
as he is a superb boxer. DeN ire takes 
LaMotta ihrough the paces. from the 
boxer's ~nger days of strivirs for 
recognitl<;>n. to his gradual rise to the 
top, to his swift slide doINnhili irto 
drunkeness and poYe:rty. The violence 
inherert in the stOt)' is not stylized or 
softened; rather, It is treated in all ItS 
brutality. as it should be In an honest 
ma.lie. When it's o.oer. ~ar~n'tsadfor 
LaMotta, but you're glad to have seen a 

~Ious performarlCe by a virtuoso 
actor.

Costello aid he is glad to

Student 
drama 

continued from page 11 
But aside from a lack of 

resources, some undergradu-
ates complain of being 
squeezed out of major ·tudio 
roles by the swe llin g 
pro port ion of grad u ate 
student . 

To be 'ure, the number of 
undergraduate drama majors 
in recent year-s has remained 
at about 100, while graduate 
enrollment has climbed from 
35 last year to 42 this year 
and is expected to reach 50 by 
next Fall. 

"There is a rivalry 
between graduates and 
undergraduates," explains 
Coste\10. "Graduate students 
are practically guaranteed 
role and design position' 
and undergraduates, more 
and more, are finding they 
aren't able to get major studio 
roles." 

Indeed, the guarantee of 
major roles largely explain' 
why the Department's 
profe ional training 
program i attracting 
graduates throughout the 
nation. 

"When you ha ve 40 
graduate actors, it's very 
difficult to get cast," he says, 
and with only about twelve 
department productions each 
year, the undergraduate 
have had to seek alternative 
outlets for their works. 

In fact one student formed 
an official campus organiza-
tion in 1979 called the Group 
of Undergraduate Theatre 
Students (GUTS), to 
establish ties with the AS 
and to represen t the 
collective interests of drama 
students. 

But GUTS is virtually 
defunct now because 
s tudent s have gaIned 
st ronger represen tat ion 
within the department, says 
the group's organizer Lisa 
Wolpe. 

In next week's festival, 
Wolpe wi'\1 direct The 
A bdicalion, an historical play 
written by Ruth Wolff. Set in 
L655, it's the story of Queen 
Christina of weden who 
abdicates the throne and flee ' 
to the Vatican for a refuge. 

"It's a heavy play," say' 
Wolpe, "kind of a femini t's 
piece about the conflict of the 
woman-in-power role." 

Wolpe , who Costello 
predicts "will real\y be 
somebody someday," plans to 
launch her career as a 
professional director in New 
York City after graduation . 
this Spring. Already she is a 
professional actre' with San 
Diego's Repertory Theater. 

Another ambitious student 
i Costello himself. In 
addition to directing Star 
Boarders, he is also the 
author of All the Pretty Little 
Horses which will be directed 
by David Lyons. 

Hi s play is about a 
mentally retarded couple 
who are crippled even further 
by their hos tile living 
conditions in the sewer ' of 
New York City. -

"Actually they are crippled 
more by what people tell 
them they are,' say' 
Co tello. "When someone 
stands over your shoulder for 
30 years and tells you that 
you're stupid, you' \1 soon 
tart believing that you'r 
·tupid. " 

Hi ' inspiration for th play 
came from his experien e of

'Galaxian' not Lorber's best 
For a while it really looked lik Eddie had 

Beaver going. Eddie, \vith fi ndi sh int nl and 
an unusually shon crew-cut, was walkin 
wit h his arm ' straight out lik a zombie. 
Beaver, who had been looking all day for 
someon to practice hi learn-aI -home 
hypnoli m on, was duped into believing that 
only a piece of string and a ba eball card had 
pul Eddie into a trance. Fortunately for the 
Beaver, Wally came to save the day by 
pu hing Eddie into a puddle of mud. 

The show ended. The TV wa turned off. 
Matt walked into his room and cranked on 

the AC*DC. Out of Drew' room came train 
of Led Zepplin . 

A little later in that very Iypi al afternoon, I 
casuall y walked past their door ' and ba k 
into Ihe suit cia 'ping a copy of th new Jeff 
Lorber album Galaxian in my hands. 

"Hot, is that I he new Jeff Lorber Fu ion 
album?" 

"Did I hear 'Jeff Lorber'?" 

over th speaker '. 
My friends looked perplexed: 
"Hey, turn th radio off. We wanna hear 

the al bum." 
"They witched label on you, guy. That 

isn't Lor r, it' Earth, Wind , and Fire." 
I explained that Lorber, with his chart 

topping hit "Monster Man" (from the album 
Galaxian), has entered into t he lucritive 
funk/ disco market. Lorber would have 
rethought the direction of his career if he 
could have een the look on my friends' 
face '. 

The Jeff Lorber Fu ion, which ha acquired 
quite a following with it tight, highly 
charted-out jazz/ rock fu ion of pa t album , 
had always managed to avoid the cliche of 
hi idiom. Unlike other fusion band (eg. 
Spyro Gyra), Lor r Fu ion stil1 hasn't fal1en 
into a void mellow redundancy_ Instead, 
Lorber took hi band to the di coteque. 

"Girl, I know you havesomespunk/'Cau e 
you really like to funk/ Girl, I love you ... " 

Jeff Lorber 

All of my friend ' were avid fans of the 
Lorber brand of jazz/ rock with its 
characteristic juxtaposition of hard rock 
.-hythm and ophisticated jazz soloing. The 
Led Zepplin album wa quickly ejected in th 
middle of "D'yer M'ker." The n edle lowered 
on the new Lorber album. All of a udden, an 
over lated funk bas , followed shortly by 
some incompr~hensible disco singing came 

That Lorber ha . forsaken the excellence of 
the last two album (Waler Sign and Wizard

solo on his bass. 

The qualities of the la ·t 
album, Wizard Island lay 
mostly in it raw, direct· 
from·the stu di o ound . 

Nowhere is this found on 
Galax ian. "Magic Lady" and 
"Bright Sky" come close; 
both have the s harp , 
careening melodies of old 
Lorber, but both sound like 
two Wizard Island cuts 
brought down to half the 
inten sity with rhythm 
counterpoints that drive only 
ha lf as hard. 

But who am I to say? Matt 
and Drew, when "Leave it to 
Beaver" isn't on, sometimes 
actuall y listen to the album. [ 
guess Galaxian is better than 
no Lorber at all.

T ennis team: fifth in nation PE class 
builds body 
and mind . Netters wrap up season in NCAA tournament 

BY NANCY LEE 
UCSD' men's var ity 

tenni quad ended a very 
impressive season la st 
weekend at the NCAA 
Dvi s ion III playoffs in 
Salsbury, Maryland. 

UCSD was one out of six 
teams to be selected in the 
country to participate in the 
Nationals and finished 5th in 
the tournament. 

The men 's overall record 
for the 1981 season was 16-
10. At the NAIA Divi ion [[I 
Districts finals. they fin ished 
a strong second place behind 
UC Redlands, and indivi-
dually John Rosenberg made 
it to the semi-final. 

Rosenberg. number one 
seed for the UCSD team. 
went as far as the round of 
16's in singles at the National 
Tournament. The tourna-
ment begins with 64 people in 
the first round . Each 
successive round then halves 
the remaining competitors 
until only two remain . 

Eugene Jones, number 
three seed for UCSD. lost to 
Donovan Jones in the second 
round, 6-0. 6-7. 3-6. 

Everett Gee and Brad 
Driver, seeded number two 

and four respectively, bot h 
lo ·t in the first round of their 
singles matches. 

Triton dou bles players G 
and Jones were downed by an 
excellent doubles team ofJim 
Hearns and Shawn Miller, 
from Gustavus Adolphus. 
who continued to win 
throughout the tournament . 
fini hing in fir t place. 

Pete Wood and John 
Rosenberg went as far as the 
round of 16's in double 
competition before 10 ing to 
Rod Dowdel and Bob Sheehy 
from Swarthmore College. 

The Tritons success this 
season was attritu bed to the 
cooperative effort of first 
year coach Peter Davis and 
the athletes. 

Coach Davis said that he 
was. "given an exceptional 
group of guys, who were 
hardworking but just needed 
to be pushed ." 

Davi s gave the team 
di cipline and ·tructure 0 
that they could focu on their 
goals and priorities for school 
and competition with 
minimal distraction. 

" My job is to motivate 
them , critique their 
technique, and develop a 
sen e of unity with the team 
structure." Davi . added. 

Communication is the key 
to developing the athletes to 
their full potential, a ' is 
building the ream concept. 
believes Davis. " A team unity 
will prevail when the 
individual is down, " he said_ 

Davi was 'incere about 
the sacrifices an athlete must 
be willing to make in order to 
reach his full potential. One 
mu t devote himself to 
keeping a s healthy as 
possible. Since competing at 
such an intense level requires 
many hours of practice and 
preparation, what little spare 
time an athlete has must be 
devoted to studie . 

An example of this 
devotion is freshman Eugene 
Jones. who sacrificed his job 
in order to commit himself 
fully to tennis and to the 
team.

Coach Davis said that 
Jones was a "coach ' . dream." 
because he improved omuch 
in ju t a 'hort time. He went 
from twelfth 'eed on the 
Triton team to number three. 

Coach Davi . came into the 
lenni ' sea on late this year 
and had only one month to 
work with hi men before 
their fir ·t match. 

However. since he had men 
who weredi 'ciplined and had 
a de ire to win, it wa ' easy to 
coach them (0 the top, Davis 
commented. 

When Davis was a . ked to 
'um up the Triton's season, 
he remarked. "It was the 
most rewarding experience 
ever in my life. It was easy to 
get their confide nce and 
respect. and from that we 
were able to come together." 

All of the player on the 
team, with the exception of 
Ro enberg who will gra-
duate. will be getting 
together early in the fall to 
prepare for the next tenni 
ea on. 
"Everyone is really excited 

about the 1982 'ea on, and i 
looking forward to working 
together," added Davis.

Crew 
"swamped" 

UCSD's men and women's 
crew teams suffered a very 
rare upset last weekend , but 
it didn't come in the form of 
competition. Enroute to the 
Western Sprint in the 
northern water of Los 
Gatos, an unfriendly storm 
squall attacked the trailer 
carrying over $20,000 worth 
of shells. When the pieces had 
been picked up, ubstantial 
damage was obvious in three 
eight man shells and one four 
man boat. 

When the weary crews 
finally pulled in for the long 
anticipated regatta, they 
were met with very choppy 
waters and a poorl y 
organ ized tournament. 
Coach lack Vallerga 
explained, "The wave were 
so bad that one shell was 
virtually wamped ." 

At days' end the one bright 
spot for the Tritons was a 
gold medal by the women's 
Novice boat. "They did a 
fantastic job, as did everyone, 
under the adver e condi· 
tions," remarked VaUerga. 

The men ended their 
season at the Sprints aside 
from the California Light· 
weight Championships at 
Mission Bay this Saturday , 
while the women will travel 
to the National Women 's 
Rowing Association fina ls 
this weekend.

also encourage ' cutbacks in 
beef intake. 

The exercise program is 
de igned to be fun as well a 
effective. The majority of the 
class periods are spent 
learning correct ways to 
uti lize exercise. Areas of 
concentration include weight 
training, rope- kipping and 
recreational fitness, uch as 
bike-riding, running or 
wimming. As an added 

extra, Cates teaches juggling 
to aid in hand·eye coordina· 
tion. 

Becau e many people are 
hesitant about runni ng, 
Cates spends a great deal of 
time teaching the c1as how 
to run correctly a well ~s 
taking the s tudents off 
campu to provide them with 
a refreshing place to run. 

Cate feels that motivation 
and enthusiasm are an 
important part of beginning 
and maintaining a fitness 
program, and structures the 
class to help provide the e for 
hi s tudents. A map of the 
United Sta te and an 
itinerary provide incentive 
for running. Each student 
records the miles he ha run 
during the week and the 
collective miles are charted 
on othe map. Thus far , the 
group has "run" to New 
York, ·topped for orange 
juice in Washington, D,C., 
and is making their way 
back to San Diego. 

Cate reports many 
succe s storie as a resu lt of 
the program, One woman has 
lost close to 30 pounds since 
enroll ing in the class in 
September. Others ·tate that 
the cia has improved their 
attitude as well as their 
bodies. Of Cates. one c1as

UCSD colleges, attrition rate 
criticized by accreditation team 
continued from page 4 
the WASC committee. 
Calling the student' 
objections to UC D' 
affirmative action effort a 
familiar "litany of com-
plaint ," the report 
a knowledged tudent 
charge of "'body counting' 
by administration for its own 
'affi rmative action' pur-
pose ," "lack of role models 
among the faculty, " "poor 
pre-entry counseling, and 
inadequate support er-
vices." 

The WASC committee 
added, howe.ver, that "this 
would be less seriou were it 
not for the fact that the 
ethnic 'mix' in California ... i 
rapidly changing so that 
within the decade the 
majorit y of students 
graduating from high chool 
in the proximate area will be 
non-caucasian. " 

Other deficient areas -
The report touch d upon an 
a 'ortment of what commit-
tee mem ber percei v d as Ie 
severe problem at C D. It 
gave careful endorsem nt of 
the communication pro-
gram, cal1ing it an "intere t-
ing and non-conventional 
interdi ciplinary program." 

Noting a "rapid increase in 
the popularity of Communi-
cation a a major" and a 
" ignificant imbalance in 
faculty work load ," the 
report call d for "continuing 
attention from appropriate 
university-wide academic 
admini trator ." 

Th thr WA C member 
also criticized the univer-
sity' evaluation of faculty 
member' instructional 
performance, and ugge ted 
that UCSD give greater 
empha i upon teaching 
abilitie when con idering 

faculty m mber ' for tenure. 
Housing, too, wa a target 

of criticism. Noting the high 
costs of housing in the La 
Jolla area, the report aid that

Bill defeated' by Senate' 
continued from page 5 

The measure's application 
to meetings of the Regents 
took a back eat to it 
potential ffect on the 
academic senate , the 

niv r s ity' s influential 
board of tenure-track faculty. 

Keene had originally 
intended the bill apply only to 
the Regent but th issue 
took on an added twi t when 
the state legi ' Iative counci l 
said it could apply to the 
academic senate and all of its 
hundred of ystemwide 
committees a well. 

The OOO-m mber acade-
mic senate acts a a policy 
and advi ory body to the 
Regents on matters of cour e 
curriculum, admi ions.fa-
culty tenure and promotion, 
research and educational 
policy and ampu ' budgets. 
Most of those committee 
meeting are not generally 
open to s tud nt . or the public 
and the Regent · rarely reject 

senate r ommendations. 
C lobbyi t Lowell Paige 

told the I gi 'Iative panel that 
having to open all committ s 
of the academic senate - he 
e ·timated there are more 
than 250 - and give public 
notice of their meetings 
would create chao within 
the ni er ·ily. 

enator Jim Ellis , R-San 
Diego, questioned whether 
Paige and the Regent 
weren't mor concerned with 
the potential "inconve-
nience" of the open meeting 
rule than opennes ', but later 
voted with the Univer ity. 

Paige al 0 aid Keene's bill 
would b unfair becau e 
other state agencie ' are 
granted variou exemption 
to meet in clo 'ed 'e ' ion 
under th open meeting law 
but the Regent would not be. 
"Our exemptions in the 
education codes were very 
carefully tailor d to th 
Regent pecial need ." 

If you're looking for a real dark beer, 
don't be double crossed. 

I w I hen you order .... <UL~~'ft"I\nlii: 
beer, unless 

you're careful you could 
get double-crossed. 
That' because there's more 
than one way to make 
beer dark. And almost 
any darkish-colored beer 
be called dark beer, regardless 
of the way it's made dark. 

How beer is made dark. 
One way I Add colored syrup. 
Our way: Gather the best barley malt obtain-
able. Slowly deep-roast it, taking care not to 
scorch or char it. Add pure brewing water and 
work the mash at appropriate temperatures for 
several hours, stirring constantly. Filter out the 
spent grain . Add a pinch of your best hops to 
resultant dark wort while boiling, then pump to 
settling tank and add pure brewer's yeast, 
cultured from your own special strain. Ferment · 
for 7-10 days, recovering resultant natural 
carbonation for re-carbonation just prior to 
bottling. Transfer dark beer to storage cellars 
for maturation and aging. Age for several weeks 
at approximately OOC, then filter. Transfer 
bright dark beer to bottles. Cap tightly and 
pasteurize to protect quality. Chill and enjoy. 

I wi e've been brewing San Miguel Dark 
our way since 1890. Granted, it takes 

more time than adding syrup, but we believe 
it enables us to make a better dark beer. 

I'T' 1 0 tell the 
difference in 
~ .......... e dark, here's what 

to look for. Deep-
--.---- roasted barley 

malt makes a 
darker dark beer. 

. methods simply don't 
art as much color to the beer. 
brewed with deep-roasted 

barley malt also has a darker head 
than beer made dark by any other method. 

1'1' Ihere's also a difference you can smell and 
taste. Try San Miguel Dark andJou'll 

experience ~ deep-roasted aroma an flavor. 
Heartier, richer, and creamier than simple colored 
beer could ever be. 

I N I ow that you can tell the difference in the 
dark, we think you'll prefer a real dark beer. 

Ours is available at discriminating taverns and 
liquor stores where fine imported beers are sold.
