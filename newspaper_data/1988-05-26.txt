SubjectA 
under fire 
(Editor 's note: This is Partllofa 
two-part examination of the 
UCSD Subject A program. Part 
Iran on Monday, May 23, /988.) 
By JILL COLLEY 
Stttl, W,lter 

The Subject A program, said 
to carry the stigma of being 
"Bonehead English," has been 
reviewed and approved by a com-
mittee, stirring up controversy 
among faculty members and the 
program's directors. 

According to Subject A Co-
ordinator George Hanson, there 
was an understanding that the 
first year of Subject A was 
"probationary, "meaning that the 
faculty wanted to see how the 
cooperative program with Mesa 
College would work. Therefore, 
at the end of the 1985-86 year, an 
evaluation of the Subject A 
program was conducted by the 
Committee on Educational Po-
licy (CEP) and the Committee 
on Undergraduate Preparatory 
and Remedial Education 
(CUPRE). 

As part of the 1986 review, 
questionnaires were given to both 
instructors and students con-
cerninl their reactions to the 
proaram. The Subject A co-
ordinator wu interviewed u well 
as the writinl directors from all 
four colleges and some Mesa 
Col1ele administrators. An eval-
uation was made based on the 
compiled responses. 

Based on the evaluations made 
by CUPRE and CEP, Hanson 
said that the faculty was 
"satisfied" with the Subject A 
program and felt it was a proJl'am 
which should continue. CUPRE 
chair Richard Herz agreed. "I 
think our general conclusions 
were that the [prolram] was 
running pretty well," Herz said. 

"We didn't just evaluate this 
program and then stop," Herz 
said, emphasizing that this initial 
report to the Academic Senate 
was the first part of an ongoing 
process of evaluation of Subject 
A by CUPRE. 

At the time of the 1986 Subject 
A review, UCSD Director of 
Writing Programs Charles 
Cooper went to CUPRE to ex-
press his dissatisfaction with the 
course. He said he furnished 
CUPRE with "evidence" that he 
felt made it clear that the UCSD 
Subject A course was inferior to 
Subject A programs offered at 
other UC campuses. 

This "evidence" was a survey 
Cooper conducted involving 
students enrolled in Subject A 
courses at UCSD, UCLA and 
Berkeley. He felt that the results 
of this survey pointed out that at 
UCSD "there were very different 
student perceptions a,nd other 
implied criticisms" of the UCSD 
Subject A program. Students at 
UCLA and Berkeley ··have a 
much more positive attitude 
about the course," Cooper said . 
He said that his criticisms "were 
pretty much ignored" by 
CUPRE. 

In June of 1986 the University 
English Council sent a letter to 
the Chair of the UCSD Aca-
demic Senate. This council in-

Dimmesdale calls A.S. a 'clique' 
Council debates appointment 
of Bard-Alan Finlan to Student 
Advocate position last night 
By DAVID BROOKS 
SttdJ W,it~' 

Amidst a heated and lengthy 
debate over an A.S. Student 
Advocate appointment, President 
Maynard Dimmesdale accused 
the council of being a group of 
"cliquish individuals" who were 
too concerned with "image." 

The A.S. was noticeably upset 
with the fact that Dimmesdale 
had recommended Bard-Alan 
Finlan for the Student Advocate 
position without having publi-
cized its openinl. Finlan, who 
Dimmesdale called an "excep-
tional individual," has been the 
center of controversy after he 
launched a one-man battle 
against the University for illegal 
accessing of his personal records. 

A.S. President Maynard Dimmesdale argues his appointment of 
Bard-Alan Finlan as Student Advocate in front of A.S. members (left 
to right) Mordecai Potash, Eric Chazankin and John Robison 
Wednesday night. 

University Center Board Com-
missioner Evan Weisenfeld ar-
gued that although Finlan may 
be qualified, Dimmesdale did 
not "follow an equitable process" 
by failing to consider other 
applicants for the position.

Graduate· students vote for fees 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
st.,g Wrltn 

UCSO's graduate students 
recently voted overwhelminlly 
to impose an activities fee on 
themselves for the first time. 

Donald Abbott, President of 
the Graduate Students AssQcia-
tion (GSA), pushed for the fee 
referendum to pass, and got his 
wish, with 772 of the graduate 
students that voted approving 
the fee and only 203 opposed. 

All 2,278 of UCSD's graduate 
students were sent mail-in ballots 
on May 2 that asked them if they 
wished to impose a quarterly fee 
of S5 on every graduate student 
next year. 

The referendum received more 
than the two-thirds ·yes' votes it 
needed to be considered valid 
under University regulations. 
Abbott said he was impressed 
with the 43 percent turnout, 
which is more than twice the 20 
percent turnout also required by 
regulations. 

"Two years ago, a similar 
referendum came very close to 
passing," Abbott said, adding 
that the GSA at UCSD is the 
only student body organization 
in the UC system that is presently 
not supported by student fees . 

In order to get the funding in 
the past , the GSA had an agree-
ment with the University Center 
Board according to which they 
would receive funding from the 

Board that would end when the 
University (Price) Center 
opened. Abbott cited this anti-
cip'ated loss of the GSA's major 
source of funds as the primary 
reason for the GSA's re-intro-
duction of the fee referendum. 

"I argued for this referedum 
for the following reasons," 
Abbott said. ··First, so that [the 
GSA] could continue and expand 
the services that we have been 
providing for graduate students 
in the past, and secondly and 
more importantly, to help the 
GSA and the graduate students 
it serves obtain a more indepen-
dent voice in the University 
structure. 

'·1 argued that unless graduate 
See FEES, pale 3 

Dimmesdale responded that he 
was ··not bound by process" since 
the appointment was "based on 
my judgment." 

Last night's debate intensified 
after Weisenfeld motioned to 
close the evaluation of Bard-
Alan Finlan to the public, since 
potentially embarassing informa-
tion might be revealed during the 
applicant's questioning. 

Dimmesdale stated that it was 
··very important for students to 
be present" during questioning. 
A.S. Programming Commissio-
ner Jonathan J udaken noted that 
the A.S. feuding was "exempli-
fying poor unity" and warned 
that this potential fission is the 
"first step in a slippery slope 
where we cut ourselves from the 
student body." 

Finlan's recommendation was 
later rejected, with 15 council 
members voting against the reco-
mmendation, two in favor of the 
appointment, and one abstention.

mately half of the submitted

UCSD Alumnus named chair 
of "Tribute to Women and Industry" 

UCSD alumnus Susan Rose Salisbury, who 
received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, has 
been named co-chair of the San Diego County 
YWCA's ninth annual "Tribute to Women and 
Industry" (TWIN) Awards. This fundraising pro-
gram culminates in a luncheon at the Sheraton Har-
bor Island Hotel at noon, June 2. 

The TWIN program honors women who have 
made significant contributions to industry in 
managerial , executive or professional roles. Com-
panies that encourage women to excell will also be 
recognized at the luncheon. The luncheon is the 
largest recognition event for corporate women in 
San Diego County. 

Salisbury's duties as chair include the coordina-
tion of all the committees, and assistance with plan-
ning, underwriting and implementing the TWIN 
events for 1988. 

Currently, Salisbury is vice president of finance 
for American Computer Corporation. She is respon-
sible for finance, accounting, personnel and 
administration. 

The TWIN program began in San Diego County 
in 1980 and has since honored more than 600 out -
standing women, as well as companies committed to 
promoting qualified women in business and man-
agement. TWIN also raises funds - nearly $50,000 
in 1987 - for career development, day care and 
child care, and other services offered by the YWCA 
for women and children. 

Relents approve architects for 
new UCSD Sciences Building 

The University of California Regents today 
approved Mitchell / Giurgola Architects, New York, 
in association with Austin, Hansen, Fehlman 
Group, San Diego, as architects for the $47.5 million 
Sciences Building to be built on the UCSD campus. 

The state-funded building will contain 182,608 
gross square feet and will be occupied by the 
departments of biology and chemistry, according to 
M.B. HeUmann, AlA, acting assistant Vice chancel-
lor for facilities design and construction. Design 
work is scheduled to begin in July 1988 with 
ground breaking projected for July 1990. 

Mitchell/Giurgola Architects will be responsible 
for the schematics, design development and con-
struction documents for the project, and Austin, 
Hansen, Fehlman Group will be responsible for the 
bid and award, and construction administration 
pnases. The two firms will work closely together 
throughout the project, and Mitchell / Giurgola will 
act as the Univenity's primary contact, conducting 
all project management activity with the University. 
Skateboard club to hold Skate-
a-thon this Friday 

The Ready to Shred Skate Club presents its first 
quarterly "SKATE-A-THON" this Friday, May 27, 
from noon til 9 p.m. The 9-hour event will be open 
to all spectaton, and a SI donation or canned food 
of a-ny sort is suggested in exchange for viewing the 
incredible skating. 

Sponsored amateurs and professionals have been 
invited to the skate club's newly refurbished half-
pipe ramp for this event to raise funds and foods for 
the homeless and battered women and children. 

The ramp is located behind Physical Plant Servi-
ces and storage area at 4051 Old Miramar Road, 
just across from Scripps Hospital south-eut of the 
UCSD baseball field. 

"La Operacion" and "Manos 
a la Obra" to be shown 

"La Operacion" and "Manos a la Obra: The Story 
of Operation Bootstrap" will be shown this Friday 
as part of t he Political Film Series. 

"La Operacion" explores the controversy of steril-
ization as a means of population control. In Puerto 
Rico, where over one third of all women of child 
bearing age have been sterilized, the operation is so 
common that it is referred to as "I. operacion." 

"Manos a la Obra" is an in-depth Investigation of 
Puerto Rico's "Operation Bootstrap," the highly 
vaunted economic development program undertaken 
in the 1950's to provide a role model for economic 
development throughout Latin Amenca. The film 
explores the historical background and the resulting 
economic cri is. 

The movies will be presented in TLH 107 at 7 
p.m.

4 Thursday, May 16, 1988 

I was sitting at the bar in the Woody Creek Tavern last week, sipping my normal huge flagon of whiskey and getting cranked 
up to the right level of alcoholic frenzy for an afternoon of fast 

driving on the local highways, back roads and maybe even a few 
residential districts, when a man from Miami came in and said he had 
a fast motorcycle to sell, for $5,000 cash. 

It was a cafe racer, he said - a fancy little hot rod with a silver 
engine the size of a football and handtooled Italian leather seats. 
... And he had it just outside in the parking lot, strapped down with 
pink bungee cords on the back of what looked like a flatbed Peterbilt 
truck. 

Nobody paid any attention to him. There was a film on TV about a 
team of French scientists trying to load a polar bear onto the fantail 
of what looked like a Caribbean tourist yacht. The beast was howling 
and thrashing, but they had it wrapped up in a steed mesh-net - and 
then a woman wearing a topless bikini came out and shot it in the 
back with a tranquilizer gun. 

The stranger took a long look at the place, then he slumped on a 
bench near the window and ordered a sloe gin sling. "Who gives a 
damn about polar bears?" he muttered. "They're dumber than dogs 
and they'l turn on you for no reason at all." 

I saw Cromwell shudder on his stool at the far end of the bar, 
where he had been nursing a Moosehead all morning and brooding 
helplessly on the 9-point spread for the game 'that was coming up. 

The day was already queasy. The morning had bloomed warm and 
briltht, but by noon it was raining fitfully and the sky was turning 
black. By 2:30 we were getting thunder and lightning. 

The polar bear film was still rolling. The brutes were being taken 
off to some zoo on the outskirts of Paris, where they would be loaded 
with electrical implants in the softer parts of their bodies and then 
turned loose on the slopes of Mount Ararat. 

T he reasons would never be explained. It was one of those top-secret international security gigs that only the French can do properly ... And meanwhile, on the other side of the world 
in a pure behavioral sink 8,000 feet up in the Rockies in a roadhouse 
on a two-lane blacktop on the low-rent side of the river , some 
nervous little fruit bag from Miami was trying to peddle a slick Italian 
motorcycle. 

Cromwell eyed him balefully for a moment, then he stood up and 
pulled a pair of ribbed leather gloves out of his hip pocket. "0. K." he 
said. "You've come to the right place. Let's have a look at the 
bugger." 

"What?" said the stranger. "You want to buy it?" 
"Not yet," said Cromwell . "But I will , if it's fast . I just got back 

from Vegas, and I have a lot of money." 
There was a hoot of dumb laughter from somewhere back in the 

kitchen, but I kept a straight face . 
The price was $10,000, said the stranger, but he was new in the 

neighborhood, so he would let it go for five . .. the only other one of 
these things ever built, he said, was sold to Steve McQueen for 
something like $40,000. 

We went outside in the rain and unloaded the slick little speedster 
down off the flatbed truck. 

Cromwell pulled on his motocross gloves. "If it's faster than my 
Jeep," he said, "1111 give you ten grand - but if it's not, you give it to 
me for nothing." 

The stranger stared at him, and nobody else said a word . "Are you 
nuts?" he said finally. "You want me to race my Ducati against a 
goddamn Jeep? For $IO,OOO? 

"Why not?" said Cromwell. "Let's go do it before the storm hits ." 

W e all agreed . It was winner-take-all. Cromwell backed his rotten-looking, mud-covered Jeep out of a corner of the parking lot and aimed it down the road, while the man from 
Miami got his bike tuned up . .. I drifted around behind Cromwell's 
machine and pulled a Parnelli Jones-Baja sticker off the rear end; the 
thing was a monster, so fast and strong that he was afraid to even 
drive it on the roads in Colorado. The engine was a 600-hp, turbo-
powered Ford-Cosworth. 

Money changed hands. There was serious talk about "honest dol-
lars" and escrow. A man called Tex stepped forward and agreed to 
hold the cash without prejudice. 

We were all involved in this thing, more or less, but nobody really 
cared ... and it was just about then that the whole world exploded 
with a boom and a flash that blew us all sideways. Cromwall's Jeep 

t urn~d blue like a gas bomb, and then fell on top of the motorcycle, 
sendmg up a cloud of nasty electrical smoke. 

We were all knocked stupid. The next sound I remember hearing 
was a woman screeching, "Please, Tex - don't die ." And then I felt 
myself being dragged across the road by people I didn't recognize. 
There was a smell of burning hair all around us, and I heard voices 
talking about "oxygen" and "heart failure" and "burned like a human 
cinder." 

No money changed hands that day, and we never saw the man 
from Miami again. Several days later I went back to the tavern and 
heard more or less what happened. We were whacked by Ii huge blue 
ball oflightning that bounced once in the parking lot and then rolled 
down the road about 200 feet before it exploded in the creek. 

Tex lived, but his heart was like a small lump of charcoal and his 
face shriveled up like a raisin. A doctor in Phoenix said his body was 

bout 400 years old , and if he ever bumped up against anything solid 
he would probably break like cheap glass. 

Letters 
SIO and 
Whales 
Editor: 

On May 15, 1988, KPBS radio 
announced that UCSD and the 
Scripps Institute of Oceanogra-
phy had entered into an agree-
ment with the University of 
Tokyo that provides for the ex-
change of faculty and students to 
conduct marine research. As a 
former AFS exchange student, I 
am very much in favor of such 
programs. They encourage the 
dissemination of knowledge and 
promote international under-
standing. 

G (J 

However, marine research in 
Japan is tainted by that coun-
try's refusal to adhere to the 
International Whaling Commis-
sion's moratorium on commer-
cial whaling. Recently, Japanese 
whalers killed 300 Minke whales 
in the Antarctic and these whales 
ended up in Japanese restaur-
ants. Zero tolerance claims another victim 

In February 1988, the US 
Secretary of Commerce imposed 
sanctions on Japan for violating 
the moratorium. The Japanese 
fleet saw its fishing quotas in 
American waters reduced by 
SO%. Unfortunately, many Jap-
anese researchers, supported by 
a strong whaling lobby, main-
tain that the killing is necessary 
for their "marine research ." 

I hope that UCSD researchers 
involved in the exchange pro-
gram will point out to their Jap-
anese counterparts that they sup-

port the moratorium. I also hope 
that they will try and convince 
the Japanese that research using 
live whales is a viable alternative. 
The SIO enjoys international pres-
tige, and I believe it should use 
its unique position to help the 
whale survive. Mankind already 
once hunted this species to the 
brink of extinction.

Jesse Jackson, a Man of Inspiration 
By PA UL BURKE 

I have seen the fu-ture . It goes by the 
name of Jesse Louis 

Jackson. 
Last weekend I was 

lucky enough to attend 
the Educational Rights 
Conference at Stanford 
University, organized 
by Third World student 
leaders from across 
California, which in-
cluded representatives 
from the student go-
vernments of the UC, 
Cal State and com-
munity college cam-
puses. 

George Bush, who 
wants to be known as 
the "education pre-
sident," failed even to 
acknowledge the con-
ference . Mike Dukakis 
sent his son to repre-
sent him, but the jun-
ior Dukakis' theme of 
crushing our competi-
tors with technology 
instead of military force 
(as President Reagan would prefer), was not well 
received by the students. 

But then Jesse Jackson took the podium in 
front of 10,000 enthusiastic, committed suppor-
ters. At that point we realized why we have been 
working so long and so hard to make his dream of 
economic justice for all people a reality. 

I am confident that I speak for the majority of 
those present in saying that Jackson's address was 
the most inspirational experience I have ever been 
a part of. As students we admire Jackson for his 
courage and commitment, for his ability to strug-
gle against the odds, as he has done his entire life, 
and overcome all obstacles in his quest to make 
America better. 

We love Jesse Jackson for his compassion 

I 

/ 

toward the less fortu-
nate, the dispossessed, 
those who have been 
so completely locked 
out from life's blessings 
that they have lost 
hope. 

But most impor-
tantly. we are inspired 
by Jesse Jackson be-
cause of his clarity of 
vision. He enables all 
of us to see better. 
Through him we are 
able to see the world as 
it really is, and not 
how those now in 
power would like it to 
be. 

He sees that as long 
as Mexico is exper-
iencing economic dis-
uter, we will have crisis 
on our border, no mat-
ter how many guards 
we hire. He sees that as 
long as Third World 
nations are in debt, our 
deficit will increase. He 
sees that as long as 
U.S.-backed regimes in 
the Third World repress 

their ~orkers and do not allow them to orgaOlze, 
orgaOlzed U.S . labor will lose their jobs as multi-
nationals move their factories to the Third World. 

Jackson sees that our world has become a 
global village, that we must learn to work with 

oth~r nations and other people as partners, not 
subjects. He sees that our priorities are morally 

~rong an~ economically "!nsound; that investing 
10 education for our children. rather than in 
nuclear weaponry, that we can't use, is not only 
right but is cost efficient. 

Jesse Jackson sees an America that is bigger 
than one culture, language or reliaion . He sees 
tha~ America cannot fulfill its promise as a great 
nation as long as people of color are excluded

Fight for 
your rights 
Editor: 

A recent administrative dif-
ficulty has awakened me to the 
fact that we , as students of 
UCSD, are often wronged. How-
ever, what is truly disturbing is 
not the fact that these wrongs 
exist, but the fact that we 
students, as the majority segment 
of this community, allow this to 
continue and do so without 
protest. 

It is amazing that many of our 
parents, who were the youth of 
twenty years ago, were highly 
concerned with these very issues 
and yet we seem so unconcerned. 
We seem to have forgotten that 
despite the fact that we live in a 
democratic state, we also live in 
an age where there are hier-
archical power structures that 
can and do inhibit the rights of 
those at the bottom. Why have 
we become so apathetic? 

Thankfully, there are a few 
who still believe that active 
protest is a morally responsible 
and necessary part of being an 

American, who, riaht or wrona 
in their political convictions 
express their opinions about 
issues such as Apartheid, animal 
rights, foreign policy, and etc. 
But we have neglected to be 
concerned about issues that di-
rectly affect us in our everyday 
lives as students. 

In my fo'ur years at UCSD 
there have been numerous issues 
that should have stirred the 
political juices of all of us, but we 
have remained quiet, frustrated , 
and apolitical. When we should 
have protested the instating of 
the no-alcohol policies, which 
interferes with the legal rights of 
all students who are of age and of

the laws of the State of California 
but also to the "laws" of UCSD .. : 
we remain silent. 

When the university continual-
ly moves the student parking lots

a.nd charges students dispropor-
tionately for the "privilege" of a

And etc ... we do nothing. 
When all of these things happen

to ask: 
Whor rhe hell is wrong with us? 
We must make an impact on the 
world . WE must defend out 
rights!

struggled his entire life to make it 
better. In Jesse Jackson, we see 
America at its best. 

On June 7, we will cast our 
ballots for a bold leader, a 
brilliant thinker, a masterful poli-
tician, and most importantly, a 
just cause. We urge you to join us 
in voting for Jesse Jackson.

This week's Bud Team of the Week award goes to a determined 

group of athletes. They go out every Thursday night and get cold 
while the rest of the population of UCSO is visiting their favorite 
party establishment. It turns out that it was worth their time 
because they've just clinched the league title. 

Sealn' The Hole demolished the UCORICE DONUTS 16-7. 
This was the game to watch because both teams approached the 
match with winning records and knew that one had to receive an 
unfavorable mark in the end. Sittin' in the Hole was obviously 
prepared for the challenge and raised their season record to 5-0.

Session, 1988, you MUST contact the Biology Department's Student Services 
Office (room 1208, Muir Biology Building) prior to May 27 to fill out the 
Department's graduation forms. Please note: This is to be done IN ADDITION 
to notifying your college of your graduation plans. 

ENROLLMENT IN BIOLOGY LAB COURSES, FALL QUARTER, 1988: 
THE APPROVED ENROLLMENT LISTS AND THE WAITING LISTS Wll..L

(please refer to the form you would have signed at the time of lab enrollment 
application for details.) Students who are approved for enrollment AND who 
officially add the lab coone MUST AlIEND THE FIRST LECTIJRE AND LAB. 
Failure to do so will result in the student's name being dropped from the course 
roster. It would be the student's responsibility 10 officially drop the coone at the 
Registrar's Office. Students who are on the lab waiting lists (or students who 
satisfy the prerequisites for lab courses and would like to enroll) are strongly

MUST submit a completed "Change of Major" form to the Biology Departmem's 
Student Services Office (room 1208, Muir Biology Building). If the student is not 
cunenLly one of the six biology majors, he/she MUST ALSO SUBMIT A COpy

The Beatles never had it so good 
CME creates high-tech, eclectic acoustics 

By ERIK KNUTZEN 
St-tf Wrltn 

Amo ng UCS O 's fores t of 
Quonset huts, in what was once a 
Marine officer's bowling alley, 
an eclectic entourage of scholars 
and students are engaged in 
elaborate experiments - musical 
experiments. 

Founded in 1972 by compo-
sition professor Roger Reynolds, 
The Center for Music Experiment 
(CME) is the only arts-related 
research unit in the UC system. 
Performers, composers, scien-
t ists, programmers, and music 
technologists intermingle in the 
soundproof rooms ofthe Center. 

Since 1979, much attention at 
CM E has focused on the creation 
of the Computer Audio Research 
Laboratory (CARL), a research 
project focusing on computer 
music applications in composi-
t ion, performance and general 
research. 

One oft he main goals o(CARL 
is "the establishment of a general 
purpose computing facility upon 
which we can simulate any acous-
tical process and realize that 
process across the entire human 
hearing range," said Garreth Loy, 
software coordinator at CM E. 

The hardware a nd software 
created as part of the CARL 
project has had benefi t s for 
composers using the facility. 
Reynolds has used CARL in the 
development of "SPLlTZ" and 
"SPIRLZ, " two programs which 
act as contemporary variation 
techniques by disassembling and 
reorganizing music fed into them. 

"SPLITZ and SPIRLZ are 
what I call editorial algorithms, 
in the sense tha t they are con-
cerned with subdividing and 
reorganizing the parts of some 
pre-composed musical material," 
Reynolds said. 

"The musical material con-
tinues to be created on an intuitive 
basis, but then is subjected to 
orderly processes to create a 
much longer and more complex 
musical structure." 

The use of highly complex 
a lgorithms, made possible by 
computer technology, has ap-
pealed to a number of composers 

Lee Ray,) has toured extensively. 
But despite the allure of high 

technology, a basic philosophy 
at C ME has been the attempt to 
avoid technological gimmickry. 

"This opportunistic syndrome 
is where you identify some tech-
nology," Loy said . "You ask the 
question 'what kind of music can 
you make?' and then you proceed 
to make that kind of music." At 
CME music comes before tech-
nology. 

The members of Kiva, a per-
formance group associated with 
CME since the early 70s, have 
found unique ways to avoid the 
technology trap. 

"If we used technology," said 
John Silber, music department 
professor and Kiva member, "we 
would always find a way to screw 
it up - to make it respond in 
such a way that was not normal 
- that was unstable." 

In contrast with many of the 
composers at CME, the members 
of Kiva have, for the most part, 
made use of "low tech" micro-
phones and recording equipment. 
Microphones and amplification 
have become Kiva 's method of 
exploring the colors and harmo-
nic structures of acoust ical in-
struments . 

"When you amplify instru-
ments," Silber said , "you begin 
to hear inside the sound." 

Getting "inside the sound" -
amplifying the unusual sounds 
and noises of trombones, violins, 
flutes and many other instru-
ments - has had many impli-
cations fo r Kiva. 

"Once you start amplifying 
sound you can no longer repre-
sent it graphically," Silber said. 
"The sound becomes so complex 
that you can no longer notate it ." 

Kiva has found answers in 
improvisation. 

" It's not based on a tradition 
like jazz," Silber said. "It is 
improvisation on a sound or a 
color. " 

The intermingling of compos-
ers, performers and technologists 
has meant a need for collabo-
ration - a difficult, but often 
profitable arrangement. Those 
With technological expertise are 
often called on to assist the

fi nd a way to screw it up." 

at CME. Loy compared the use 
of musical algorithms to the 
Japanese art of Sumi painting, in 
which a single brush stroke con-
veys subtle and complex details . 

" I'm very attracted to the 
notion of being able to make a 
broad statement and have the 
details take care of themselves, 
much like the individual fibres of 
the brush which takes care of the 
details in a Sumi painting," Loy 
said. 

Performance at CME has also 
been touched by the advance-
ments in computer technology 
and digital recording. A mobile 
system made up of CAR L equip-
ment and a high-tech electronic 
violin (performed by music de-
partment )'rofessor and violinist

"vision" of composers and per-
formers - an interaction which 
Reynolds compared to the work 
of artist Peter Paul Rubens. 

"Rubens may have designed 
multiple paneled murals but he 
didn't actually paint most of 
them," Reynolds said , " His as-
sistants painted them. The vision 
was Rubens, and the quality 
control was his, but the actual 
brush strokes were not. It was 
more sensible for him to get 
assistants and thereby achieve a 
greater number of works." 

Reynolds feels that collabo-
ration between musicians and 
music technologists generates a 
reciprocal relationship that, ideal-
ly, enables musicians and techno-
logists to benefit from each other's 
ideas and areas of expertise . 

The Center for Music Experiment is the only arts-related research unit on any UC campus. The 
Center was founded in 1972 by composition professor Roger Reynolds. 

VESA programs entertain 
study-wearied students 
By WENDY STEINLE 
C_diM IIII~r" 

Going to a gym concert, 
watching a Mandeville sneak 
preview, attending the chamber-
music series, or simply joining a 
student organization are all ways 
in which registration fees are 
spent here at UCSD. 

The University Events and 
Student Activities Office, 
(UESA) is responsible for pro-
gramming campus-wide events 
and advising student organiza-
tions. Formerly called the Univer-
sity Events Office, its name was 
changed three years ago to UESA 
to "more realistically reflect the 
scope of the responsibility of the 
office," explained Lynne Peter-
son, director of UESA. 

The Registration Fee Com-
mittee allocates a certain amount 
of student registration fees to 
UESA, which is one ofthe basic 
funding sources for the program-
med events and activities of the 
UESA office . Other funding 
comes from ticket revenue, grants 
and an endowment from the 
Regents. 

The University events sector 
of UESA is made up of six 
committees that program events 
within their respective areas of 
concentration. The dance-drama 
committee programs professional 
touring dance and theatre groups. 

For contemporary music fans , 
the Pop events committee, is 
responsible for the headliner 
concerts that arc held in the gym. 
The music committee is respon-
sible for the programming of 
essentially any kind of music 
that would not fan under Pop 
events, such as the Jazz Festival 
and the chamber-music series. 

The special events committee 
is responsible for the cont racted 
comedy on campus, as well as 

such unusual acts as theatrical 
juggling. The speakers forum 
committee schedules the diverse 
range of speakers who lecture on 
campus, and the film committee 
programs the sneak previews that 
are shown in the Mandeville 
auditorium, as well as the inter-
national film series. 

Volunteers keep the program-
ming committees running. These 
volunteer groups elect their chair 
from the membership. That chair, 
in turn, serves on the University 
Events Programming board. The 
A.S. commissioner of program-
ming and the Pub programmer 
are also members of the board. 

"The University Events Pro-
gramming board sets the overall 
guidelines for the office. Its major 
function is to take the registration 
fee allocation money and re-
allocate it to the committees," 
said Peterson, director of U ESA. 

The six committees are divided 
among three UESA office advi-
sors. In the decision-making 
process, either the advisor will 
bring ideas to the committee, or 
the committee-members will 
generate ideas amongst them-
selves . 

"It is a shared dialogue between 
students on the committees and 
the office," Peterson explained. 
In the programming process, the 
committees make recommenda-
tions, and advisors help them 
develop a budget sheet to find 
out if the event is financially 
plausible. 

"There is not a real limitation 
on choosing programs, only on 
the budget," Peterson said. 

"Our office has been given a 
charge by the University to do 
programming. If we didn't get 
any students interested in partici-
pating at all , we would still do 
programming." However, Peter-
son explained , "This [fact] does 

not diminish our desire to get the 
students involved in the program-
ming process." By joining one of 
the six committees, students have 
a chance to share their ideas and, 
in many cases, see them become 
reality. To join one of the com-
mittees, no particular skills or 
knowledge are necessary. 

"We'l teach you what you 
need to know," Peterson said. 
"UESA is really a business. 
Students have the opportunity 
to learn budgeting, marketing, 
reason, and negotiation . All of 
this augments a student's aca-
demic prugram," Peterson added. 

With over I 75 student organi-
zations registered with UESA, it 
seems that extracurricular acti-
vities are also a large part of a 
student's learning process. "It is 
a priority for the campus to 
foster organizations. Student 
organizations play an extremely 
important role in the enrichment 
of campus life," Peterson said. 

One of the main concerns of 
UESA is to provide a "culturally 
rich environment" in which 
stu<Jents can develop . "We are 
dedicated to the cultural enrich-
ment of student life through the 
presentation of professional per-
forming arts," Peterson stated. 

"UESA helped fund the 
Mandeville Art Gallery with the 
visual arts department, the 
writing series with the literature 
department, and recently pro-
duced a chamber-music series. 

For fall quarter '88, a trial 
course is being offered by the 
music department called Music 
13. For the course, UESA will 
produce nine world music con-
certs ranging from African 
marimba to a classical violonist. 
The professor of the course will 
formulate lectures and the art ists 
will talk to the class about the

ContiDued from pale I 
backgro'imdof their music and 
instruments. It is going to be "a 
really diverse, high energy, 
course," Peterson said. 

As far as contemporary music 
concerts go , the pop events 
committee has not yet made plans 
for next year. "Most bands don't 
know what they are doing until 
two months before that date," 
explained Frank Yarr. chair of 
the pop events committee. 

This year the pop events 
committee programmed two gym 
shows: Squeeze, during winter 
quarter, and Burnin, Spear early 
in spring qurter. 

Some students may have 
noticed a decrease in the number 
of gym concerts produced this 
year as compared to previous 
years. There are several reasons 
for this decrease. 

In order to schedule a concert 
on a cer:tain date, UESA must 
put in a proposal to the P.E. 
department for the use of the 
gym. Three out of three P.E. 
administrators must agree to the 

proposal which would mean the 
possible rescheduling of P.E. 
classes and intramural sports. 

If all three administrators do 
not accept the proposal ~he show 
doesn't happen," explained pop 
events chair Varr. Even when the 
proposal is accepted, it may take 
two to three weeks for the 
decision to be made during which 
time bands often get booked 
elsewhere. 

Another set-back is the rental 
cost ofthe stage and sound equip-
ment. "If the school had all this, 
the cost would be down and we 
could have more shows," Yarr 
said . 

UESA events are advertised 
through the Guardian. the 
Reader. banners, and flil;rs . A 
lack of advertising for upcoming 
events is sometimes a problem. 

"Many times I have seen the 
Guardian cover local off -campus 
bands instead of covering the on-
campus bands," Yarr said. "The 
reason that I would like the 
GUlITdlan to cover the events 
before they happen is because 

Programmers 

the students paY'for them and we 
would like to see as many students 
attend as possible." 

Director Peterson maintains 
that "the lack of facilities con-
tinues to be the billest frustra-
tion and limitation." 

"It is my understanding that 
the building of an outdoor 
amphitheatre was put back in 
the master plan for the UCSO 
campus," Peterson said . " From 
a programming standpoint, an 
amphitheatre would provide us 
with the most flexibility. We 
could do symphony concerts as 
well as major rock shows." 

If an amphitheatre were to be 
added to the UCSD campus, it 
would not be built in the near 
future . For the time being, stu-
dents can look forward to the 
TGIO on June 10th which is 
sponsored by the A.S. and the 
UESA pop events committee. 

"The A.S. provides the beer 
and the clean up, [and] the pop 
events committee provides the 
band, sound, security, and hospi-
tality," Yarr said.

Subject A 
Continued frOID pale I 
cludes all University of Califor-
nia English department chairs 
and composition directors. The 
letter stated that the University 
English Council opposed the Su b-
jcct A pro,ram instituted at 
UCSD, and they ur,ed the Aca-
demic Senate to abandon its sup-
port of the arran,ement made 
with Mesa Community ColleJC. 

Cooper pointed out that 
UCSD is the only UC campus 
that has entered into a contract 
with a community colle,e to 
conduct its Subject A courses. 
"Other campuses have resisted 
it," said Cooper, who added that 
many people in the UC system 
are "bewildered" by what UCSD 
has done .. 

The University En,lish Coun-
cil also opposed the use of the 
Subject A exit exam Jiven at 
UCSD. This is because the 
UCSD exit exam is the same as 
its placement exam. The council 
stated that "any system that 
maintains instruction at a com-
munity colle,e level toward the 
end simply of retakin, and even-
tually passillJ the exam subverts 
both the function of the exam 
and the goals of the Subject A 
requirement ... 

"This is [a grammatically] 
embarrassing statement," Han-
son said. "You would think that 
people who make their living 
teaching English would formu-
late a better statement than 
that." Hanson is also a member 
of the council. 

"There is a political interest 
here," Hanson said. He added 
that certain members of the 
council perceive the UCSD-Mesa 
College cooperative as a "'hreat 
to their own programs." 

According to Hanson, some 
other UC campuses are worried 
that if the Mesa College arran-
gement works, then the UCSD 
Subject A program may become 
a model that they would be 
encouraged to follow. Hanson 
said he was sure this was the 
case; if UCSD's program works 
they believe "all the dominos will 
fall." 

The Subject A "stigma" is what 
led one San Diego reporter to 
refer to the course as "Bonehead 
English." 

"Subject A is a message to the 
high schools," Revelle Provost 
Tom Bond said. "It's saying 
'teach these students how to 
write." There must be a stigma 
attached to Subject A if we are to 
get our message across ... 

Cooper said he felt that many 
people at UCSD did not take 
Subject A seriously from the 
beginning. He said that Subject 
A was a chance to create a "really 
challenging university-level, 
meaningful course that did not 
stigmatize any of the students in 
it." He added that "it was atti-
tudes like Bond's that prevented 
me, in part. from carrying this 
argument." 

In this era of poor student 
preparation we need more reme-
dial course work, not less," Han-
son said. 

Council of Provosts Chair 
David Wong said he thinks the 
program is working "reasonably 
well and will be better next year." 

Cooper sarcastically agreed. 
"Nothing has changed, and don't 
let anybody tell you anything has 
changed because it hasn't 
changed," he said. Cooper main-
tained that "'he present Subject A 
program is unfair to everybody 

and an insult to the campus." 
Hanson feels differently: "I see 

that for UCSD in 1988 the cur-
rent arrangement is really the 
best alternative we have."

Coach Box 

Leading softball to success: 
Lin Adams and Lisa Bassi 

By ELISA T ABILE 
Gu.,dJ",.lllter" 

F or the women's inter-collegiate softball team, a long and challenging 
ea on has finally come to an 

end. The equipment and uni-
forms have been neatly packed 
away u ntil next year. Never-
thele s, the energy and ded i-
cation that led the team to an 
impressive record of 32-10-2 
hasn't been put on the shelf 
for storage. This is because 
Lisa Bassi and Lin Ada ms, 
co-head coaches of the soft ball 
team, are still hard at work . 

Bassi and Ada ms have just 
completed their first year 
coaching at UCSD. The recent 
success of the softball team is 
only a small indication of the 
talent, knowledge and deter-
mination that are character-
istic of these two coaches. 

Lisa Bassi, a native Calif-
ornian, has been playing soft-
ball as long as she can re-
member. She played on her 
high school team as well as on 
the intercollegiate team at Cal 
Poly Pomona where she 
received a scholarship for 
softball. Bassi has also played 
in ASA's women's fast pitch 
softball for the past ten years. 
This past summer her ASA 
team, the Orange County 
Majestics, won the national 
championships. 

"I always knew 1 wanted to 
be involved in athletics, speci-
fically softball, It Bassi sa id. 
This is no surprise. She comes 
from a very athletic family, 
"and sports are like second 
nature to [her]." She says she 
was inspired by her father. 
who coaches a Wide variety of 
sports, and by her college 
coaches as she got older. 

As for Lin Adams, who is 
originally from San Antonio, 
Texas, softball has always 
been a major part of her life. 
She played in Bobby Sox, 
high school and on the inter-

collegiate team at Chico State. 
he, too, has played in ASA's 

women' fast pitch softball in 
Northern and Southern Calif-
ornia and in Texas. "Softball 
and athlet ics as a whole are 
very challenging and reward-
ing," Adams said. 

Softba ll was the unifying 
factor in the friendship be-
tween Bassi and Adams which 
was established over I 5 years 
ago. They met when they were 
playing soft ball - Bassi in the 
minors and Adam~ in the 
majors. Adams also coached 
with Bassi's father as an 
assistant coach to one of 
Bassi's teams. Their families 
are friends as well, and both 
Bassi and Adams have kept in 
contact over the years. 

It was in January of this 
year that softball brought the 
two of them together again. 
The previous head coach of 
the women's soft ball team left 
suddenly, and the athletic 
department needed to fill the 
vacancy immediately. 

It was a fluke that both 
Bassi an Adams applied for 
th position. During conver-
sation, they realized that both 
of their interviews were sche-
duled for the same day and 
they decided to ride down to 
San Diego together. When 
they arrived , they were asked 
if they wouldn't mind being 
interviewed at the same time; 
having been old friends , 
!leither objected. 

It is not surprising that the 
athletic department was im-
pressed with both Bassi and 
Adams. They were offered the 
positions of co-head coaches, 
and neither could turn down 
the opportunity to work toge-
ther. 

"Working together has been 
easy because there is so much 
knowledge between the two of 
us and our philosophies are 
very similar, It Bassi said. Bassi 
sees the positions of co-head 
coaches as "an advantage from 
a coaching standpoint." 

Adams said that "a good 
coach is first a good teacher, to 
and she feels that their col-
lective "knowledge and exper-
ience has had a positive effect 
on the team." 

Bassi and Adams decided 
from day one to make all team 
decisions together . Even 
though Bassi is an outfielder 
and Adams an infielder, they 
agreed that they would both 
be involved in all aspects of 
the game. Thus, they both 
work with the pitching, hitting, 
catching and fielding. 

"The group has done an ex-
cellent job in adjusting to two 
new head coaches in such a 
short amount of time and has 
handled the two of us well," 
Adams added. 

Both Bassi and Adams feel 
that they have come a long 
way in the past five months, 
which they believe is a direct 
reflection of the athletes and 
of the support of the athletic 
department. 

Both Bassi and Adams are 
impressed with the athletic' 
program at UCSp and believe 
that the r~putations of all the 
intercollegiate teams are tre-
mendous. "The quality of 
athletic competition at UCSD 
is really very high," Adams 
added. 

As far as their own team is 
concerned, Bassi and Adams 
are very proud of their per-
formance this year. They are 
excited to build a "reputable" 
program. There are only two 
graduating seniors this year 
and the coaches are busy doing 
some "pretty solid" recruiting 
for the positions opening up. 

Both coaches recognize the 
potential their girls have to 
become a national champion-
ship team. And, after their 
first season as co-head coaches, 
Lisa Bassi and Lin Adams 
have proved that their determi-
nation and talent and that of 
their team members can't be 
ignored.

Vallez seeded 2nd 
in 800 meter run 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sport' Editor 

The Triton track team began 
its attempt to bring back another 
NCAA trophy for UCSD yester-
day in the first round of the 
NCAA National Track Tourna-
ment and if the result is any 
indication of what to expect, the 
Tritons could fare quite well this 
year. 

Tim Vallez was the only Triton 
to run in yesterday's events at 
Carleton College in Northridge, 
Minnesota. Running in the first 
heat of the 800 meter trials, Vallez 
qualified for finals with a second 
place seeding with a time of 
1:51.45. He trails first seed Vince 

Commentary 

VanDurik of Case Western 
University, Ohio by 7/ l00ths of 
a second. 

Vallez's time also breaks the 
university record he set May 8 
with a time of 1:51.88. 

Other UCSD qualifiers for the 
national tournament include pole 
vaulter Rick Harper, Denise 
McFayden (1,500 and 3,000 
meter runs), Shannon Quigley 
(shotput and discus throw), and 
Gisele English (1 ,500 meter race). 
These participants will begin their 
trial events today. 

The tournament is co-hosted 
by Carleton College and St. Olaf 
College and will continue through 
Saturday, May 28. 

Why the Lakers 
will win it all 

By PHIL GRUEN 
St"" Write' 

Lees be honest with ourselves 
here. The Utah Jazz never really 
had a chance against the Lakers 
in their recent NBA playoff series 
which concluded Saturday. I 
mean, get serious. Just take one 
good look at Jazz center Mark 
Eaton, and everything should be 
well explained. 

So you think the Lakers had 
trouble containing K.arl "Mail-
man" Malone and his troops? 
Right. The purple and gold-clad 
men were merely toying with 
their foes from the saltworld -
giving them a chance, so to speak. 

If I know t~~!.e Lakers well 
enough, they want to get in 
enough practice as possible be-
fore their inevitable showdown 
with the Celtics which, mark my 
words, will happen once again. 
After all, why do you think the 
Lakers ever lose games during 
the season? The answer is pretty 
obvious - they need to try out 
their second and third string 
teams. 

The fact is, this Laker ballclub 
is undoubtedly the best profes-
sional basketball team in the 
history of the game. Their only 
competition comes from last 
year's Laker ballclub, which is 
virtually the same as this year's 
team anyway. 

Have you ever noticed that 
there is hardly ever a game where 
a member ofthe Lakers scores 30 
points? This is not to say that the 
players on the team are incapable 
of doing so. Oh no. Although 
Jabbar may be getting a bit old 
to score that many, either Magic 
Johnson , James Worthy, or 
Byron Scott can do it. Easily. 

Play 

Magic could probably score 40 a 
game if he wants to. But he 
doesn't need to. 

If Michael Jordan had a decent 
team around him, he might not 
be needed to go out and pump in 
40+ points just about every night. 
But the Bulls need him to score 
that much, because they don't 
have anybody else on their team 
capable of such a feat. 

The point I'm leadfng to here 
is that the Lakers, because they 
have so much talent, have learned 
to divide the workload up among 
the players so that a dominating 
team game is established that 
cannot be stopped. It wasn't 
stopped last year, and it won't be 
stopped this year either. 

So if the Lakers have such a 
great team with no real individual 
superstars, to whom can one 
attribute their success? When 
given any thought at all, the 
answer is clear. Laker coach Pat 
Riley is the greatest basketball 
coach ever. 

Even though Riley has never 
been selected as Coach of the 
Year in his seven year term as 
head maestro of the Laker Phil-
harmonic, there is no question 
he is the greatest ever because he 
hs demonstrated control over his 
players better tban any other 
coach. Riley just greases back his 
hair, tells his players to win, and 
then enjoys the game. It's amaz-
ing, but his players almost always 
carry out his orders. 

Riley's instructions will be 
firmly carried out over the next 
few days alainst the Dallas 
Mavericks, and when they get 
the pleasure of competing against 
that whirlwind of whiteness 
known as the Celtics, say good-
night, Beantown.

Volume 18 May 26. 1988 Number 8 

UNDERCRADUAT 

A 97 year~old man, Man~ 
dell Weiss, bought a glass of 
'wine' at UCSD. He then of~ 
fered the wine to the campus 
members. The artists are the 
free, creative, intoxicating wine 
that mold to the wine glass 
form of the university. 

Weiss generously offers this 
wine of the arts to all through 
his philanthropic donation of 
$2.34 million toward the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre, the 
Weiss Forum and his con~ 
tinued involvement and su~ 
port of the arts on campus. 

In honor of his generosity 
and his love of the arts, this 
year's Undergraduate Arts 
Festival (UAF) is dedicated to 
him. As the chairperson of the 
event Muir Provost Patrick J. 
Ledden sincerely stated, 
"UCSD has a great affection 
for Mandell Weiss, the dedi~ 
cation tries to say it. He really 
is the sort of person who res~ 
tores your faith in mankind." 

UAF which was founded in 
1982 by Dr. John Stewart and 
Professor Moira Roth, con~ 
tinues to restore faith in 
UCSD's arts program. The 
obscuring shadow of being just 
a top research institute van~

May 31-June 10. 1988 

compasses the campus in color 
and culture during the tenth 
week. 

The Festival begins May 31 
and runs through June 10 to 
allow undergraduates to 
expose their art work in all 
disciplines; theatre, dance, vis~ 
ual art, literature, and music. 

On Thursday, June 9, the 
all~campus dedication cere~ 
mony and closing is the climax 
of the event where the Stewart 
Prize winners will be an~ 
nounced and their works will 
be presented or performed at 
4 p.m. at the Mandell Recital 
Hall. 

The John Stewart Prize was 
established last year in honor 
of the former Muir Provost 
who managed to establish in 
his tenure the departments of 
music, theater and visual arts. 

The Stewart Prize awards 
five $200 prizes in the areas of 
music, dance, theater, poetry 
and the visual arts. An award 
is based on a high level of 
excellence in a field of art. 

Ledden hopes that the Stew~ 
art Prize will establish itself as 
a recognition of outstanding 
accomplishments in art. He 
aspires for the awards to 
become a definition of artistic 

by sabrina youmans 
hi.rul writer 

excellence. 
The Festival has prompted 

other artistic awards and 
grants. The Cancer Center 
Research Grant also started 
last year to recognize and help 
fund visual arts. It is limited to 
V A students. It is supported 
by the donations and interests 
of the staff members of the 
Cancer Research Center which 
is located near the visual arts 
classrooms. According to Dr. 
Adrian Brian, the grant was a 
result of the research center's 
proximity to the quonset huts. 
"[Because] of the unique set~ 
ting of the research center, we 
are able to watch the students 
at work ... [and to] talk to 
them." 

This year's three grant 
winners are Christofer "Boz" 
Jennings, Greg Rogers and Lois 
Yu. 

Another award is the Visual 
Arts Project Grant Award, 
which is funded by the V A 
faculty and is also limited to 
V A students. This year there 
are nine Project Grant Award 
winners. Marianne Banda's 
"Mi Conundrum" is a sculp~ 
ture project based on the poem 
of the same name by a manic 
depressive. "Windframe" is 
Gigi Clark's studio project that 

combines the wind, a free~ 
standing window frame, poly~ 
steel fiber curtains and syn~ 
the sized xylophone music. 

Other winners are Lawrence 
K. Fulbeck, whose slide and 
synched audio presentation is 
about his family's dealing with 
his grandmother'S health 
problems entitled, "Just Stand 
Still." Gabrielle Jennings is 
interested in the different ways 
people perceive art. Her paint~ 
ing project is titled "Intimacy 
in Unity." 

Liz O'Garvey and Jay 
Greathouse received the award 
as a filmic team working on 
related but separate projects. 
Greathouse's film, "Night for 
Day," shows the architecture 
and landscape of San Diego. 
O'Garvey continues this theme 
with "Alice Never Did Live 
Here Anyway," which deals 
with the loss of identity which 
"happens to a person living in 
a technological urban society 
with too many restraints." 

Christofer "Boz" Jennings, 
recipient of a Cancer Center 
Research Grant, got a V A Pro-
ject Grant for his sculpture 
project, "Thing," which deals 
with abstract symbolic mean~ 
ing that is not easily under-

stood through reason. 
"Modesty and Vanity" is a 

painting project that explores 
the parameters of the cultural 
extremes and traditional values 
held by women. Jim Valladao 
is presenting a media profect 
called, "Icons of the Modern 
Age." He describes the 16 mm 
film as being able to, "Take 
common symbols of modern 
society and present them in a 
way that will redefine the 
symbol and thus make the 
viewer feel uncomfortable." 

The energy of the Arts Fes~ 
tival comes from the artist 
themselves and their involve~ 
ment, "Students are deeply 
involved in planning, that's 
why the Festival changes each 
year. It depends on the inter~ 
ests of the students." Ledden 
continues, "By actually partici~ 
pating in it they learn a lot, it 
enriches them." 

This is BozJennings' second 
time shOWing at the UAF and 
he believes, "It's a good thing, 
the space available isn't the 
greatest, but it is a way for 
people to become aware that 
something is going on. It's 
great exposure - people from 
off campus looking at the art 

. - it's an extra."

Is 
love 
sexy? 

by michael martinez: 
contriburinl writer 

Gershwin simply had a CT'USh 
on you. 

The Beatles just wanted to 
hold your hand. 

And Prince, well .. . netJeryml 
mind! 

The diminutive master of 
funky pop has been preaching 
a philosophy of sex and party 
since his earliest days. In a 
sense, his career is the hornier, 
hedonistic flip side of Stevie 
Wondtr's, whose message is 
that brotherhood and love 
equals global harmony. 

"Lovesexy" merges sex and 
politics, and writes a new 
equation - sex and love 
replace drugs and war. If your 
goal is love and your vice is 
sex, then, as he says on 
"Alphabet St.," "Put the right 
letters together and make a better 
day . .. 

The LP's opening track 
"No" sets the tone. A typical, 
whimsical intro features cos-
mic babble from a mystical 
woman, a shriek of glee, the 
Captain annoucing his theme 
of "Welcome to the new 
Power Generation, It and 
POW! -takeofffor a bumpy, 
syncopated ride accentuated 

with sassy horn riffs. 
The most te'lling lyric here 

asks you to Say No - if U 
want a drug, other than the God 
abo.Ie. In "Dance On," Prince 
continues to elaborate on his 
social commentaries. He's 
come a long way since the sim-
ple ban-the-bomb message of 
"1999." There's nothing sub-
tle in the way he puts down 
terrorism and gangs - "Gre-
nade launcher roars in a televi-
sion sky IT ell me how many young 
brothers must die" and later, 
"Little Talk Johnny blew the big 
score/The gang nailed his feet to 
a wooden floor. " 

As always, his favorite 
hobby and lyrical preoccupa-

tion is unabashed, greasy sex. 
The Eastern-influenced "Glam 
Slam" and "Lovesexy'" are 
rampant with engorged nip-
ples and other sexual meta-
phors. "When 2 R In Love" Is 
lyrically less blunt and more 
erotic, and features the pretti-
est harmonies he's ever waxed. 
"I Wish U Heaven" is abso-
lutely Stevie-like in its dreami-
ness. 

"Lovesexy" may not be the 
commercial success that "Sign 
of the Times" was, and no hit 
single seems to jump out. But 
it is the latest stage in the 
development of rock's most 
imaginative artist. And the ride 
is 50 smooth. 

As part of UCSD's sixth 
Undergraduate Arts Festival, 
undergraduates will stage five 
original plays in the Warren 
Theatre June 2-5. The plays 
will be d ivided into two 
groups. Group A will play on 
June 2 and 4 at 8 p.m. and 

" Art of the Southwest," an 
exhibition of students works 
from V A 1260 taught by Pro-
fessor Jehanne Teihet-Fisk, 
will be shown from Tuesday, 
May 31 through Saturday, 
June 4 in the Humanities 
Undergraduate Library. The 
art is inspired primarily by the 
Pueblo, Hopi, Zuni, Tewa, and 
Navajo Indians.

woman's affair with her hus-
band's best friend . Pinter 
approaches this jaded love tri-
angle from a different angle. 
The play's format is not lin-
ear; in fact the plot works in 
reverse. 

"Betrayal" stars Douglas 
Roberts Gerry), Rosina Wid-
dowson-Reynolds (Emma) 
and Ron Richards (Robert) at 
the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre 
in downtown San Diego. The 
play begins with the end. In 
the . first scene, the audience 
discovers that Emma has had a 
long-running affair with Jerry 
which has ended, and her 
marriage is over as well. From 
there the play is primarily a 
scene-by-scene series of flash-
backs. 

Through these flashbacks 
the audience is eventually able 
to gain a sense of each rela-
tionship: the lovers, the mar-
ried couple, and the friend-
ship. Pinter's main objective 
reflects the play's title; it is the 
"betrayal" of the bonds that 
tie this triangle of people 
together. 

Although the chronology of 
the story is unique, it is a bit 
difficult to follow especially 
because of the frequent refer-
ence to time: how long ago 
they met, how long it had been 
since. .. etc. Time may not 
have been such an issue if my 

attention had been held more 
steadily in the first half of the 
play. 

The stage is small, which 
limits the characters' move-
ments, but the complete 
absence of any action in the 
first couple of scenes detracted 
from the credibility of the dia-
logue. The play picked up in 
the third scene when Richards, 
playing Emma's husband, was 
introduced. His gestures and 

slight movement about the set 
added a dimension of realism 
to the story. 

The development of the 
relationships did not come 
together until the last couple 
of scenes. Robert'S language 
was stilted and stage-like in 
the beginning. There was a 
misplaced tension in the air; 
rather than feeling the tension 
between the characters, it was

Chekov's 
cherished 
oTchaTd 

by mark kenney 
hiatus writer 

Anton Chekov, the famous 
Russian author, is known for 
having the rare ability to write 
truly realistic dialogue. It was 
partly for this reason that his 
moving romantic comedy, 
"The Chetry Orchard," was 
selected by the department of 
theatre to be performed by 
UCSD's first-year graduate 
students which opened yes-
terday at the Warren Theatre . 
The play will continue through 
this Sunday, May 29. 

Chekov's play, one of his 
most popular, is about the end 
of aristocracy in 19th century 
Russia. The protagonist, the 
aging Madame Ranevskaya 
(played by Jessica Black), is 
the type of woman so unwil-
ling to allow change that she 
still calls one of the rooms in 
her house "the nursery" years 
after her youngest child out-
grew it. 

In "The Cherry Orchard" 
she is factd with the loss of her 
whole estate as well as the end 
of the life that she has known. 
The futile attempt of Madame 
Ranevskaya and her friends to 
save both the house and the 

cherry orchard create the set-
ting for the play, in which 
changing times place a future 
in front of Ranevskaya which 
she is powerless to change. 

Chekov often interweaves 
tragic elements into his plays, 
and "The Cherry Orchard" is 
no exception. The aristocratic 
figures are people who must 
deal with the end of their cher· 
ished way of life. Ranevskaya 
watches a newly rich peasant 
take over the estate on which 
she had raised her children. 

Directed by Arthur Wagner, 
the cast consists almost en-
tirely of first-year UCSD 

graduate students. Appearing 
in the play are Danny Bur-
stein, Lwmaria Garcia, Molly 
Powell, David Ledingham, 
Karen Vesper, Kevin Connel, 
Don McKay, Mark Deakins 
and Susan Leigh. 

Tickets are $5 for general 
admission, $3 for students and 
are available through the 
Mandell Weiss Center ticket 
office (534-4574) and the 
UCSD box office located in 
the Student Center (534-
4559). Tickets may also be 
purchased at the Warren 
Theatre on the night of the 
performance. 

Betrayal 
Continued from pale 2 
felt withan the actors. 

Robert's frequent pauses 
and blank stares separated him 
from his character. Widdow-
son-Reynolds and Richards 
seemed more relaxed, which 
made their characters real. 

The last two scenes achieved 
Pinter's objective. The charac-

ters seemed to let loose and 
relax, enabling them to fully 
commit themselves to their 
roles. In the last scenes the 
feeling between the various 
couples could be felt throu~h 
their exprtssion of emotion. 

Pinter is a well·known 
playwright who has won many 
awards including a Tony. He 
is known for his clean, realis-
tic dialogue. He once said, "I 
write about the weasel under 
the cocktail cabinet."

lines, canvas, and space and 
try to make something 
good, as art," said Max 
Estenger about his Masters 
of Fine Arts Exhibition. 

Six raw canvases, the 
color of wheat, look like 
giant one-dimensional play 
bfocks against the walls of 
the Annex G allery. This 
installation is remarkably 
similar to Curt Thomas' 

show last week, but it is not 
quite as meticulous with 
detail. 

The abstract, clean sim-
plicity of style is apparent 
in both shows, as well as the 
similar medium and usage 
of color, lines and space. 

Estenger 's work deviates 
from Thomas' through the 
use of generating panels 
which appear on the top 

corner of every work to 
create the dimensions of 
the larger work. The gener-
ating panels took like horns, 
patterned as miniatures of 
the larger piece. 

The generating panels as 
well as the main pieces are 
hungry for more color. The 
tiny color blocks that are 
present are lost in the huge 
expanse of the bland canvas. 

Estenger attempts abso-
lute abstraction with his art, 
but to generate an image, 
and for that image to inte-
ract with the viewer, a 
grounded reference must be 
made and identified to the 
empirical world. 

The show runs through 
May 27. The gallery is open 
from 1-5 p.m. daily.
