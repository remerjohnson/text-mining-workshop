CalPIRG reports 
textbook'rip-off' 
Average student spends 
$898 per year, study says 

By USA MAK 
Staff Writer 

The average UC student will 
spend nearly $900 on textbooks in 
2003-04, according to a study 
released by California Student 
Public Interc.:st Research Group on 
Jan. 29. 

The report, "Rip-off 101 : How 
the Current Practices of the 
Textbook Industry Drive Up the 
Cost of College Textbooks," 
reveals methods that textbook pub-
-jishers use to raise prices. It makes 
policy suggestions to reduce text-
boole costs for studen~. ' '. 

"It's the most comprehensive 
report of its kind," UCSD 
CalPIRG co-chair Matthew Reents 
said. 

During fall quarter of 2003, 
CalPIRG conducted a survey of 
521 students at seven University of 
California campuses and inter-
viewed 156 faculty members at 
nine public universities and one 
community college. The investiga-
tion comprised of 33 pairs of dif-
ferent editions of the five most 
widely assigned college textbooks 
at each of the campuses surveyed.

UCSD revenues grow to $1.8 billion 
Private donations, research grants on the rise 

By BRYAN lSAO 
Associate News Editor 

Despite a $21.6 miJlion reduc-
tion in state funding last year, 
UCSD reported $1.8 biJlion in 
revenues against $1.6 billion in 
expenditures in 2003, according to 
UCSD's annual financial report. 
Compared to 2002, revenues rose 
$79 million, mostly attributed to 
increases in federal grants, which 
accounted for $48 
million~edical Center revenue, 
which accounted for $20 milJion; 
and increases in fee revenue, 
which gr~ $17 million. 

UCSD derives much of its rev-
enue from research grants from 
federal, state, local and corporate 
source. Such grants accounted for 
$627 million of revenue in 2003. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor .Resource 
MaJU~~ Margaret 1. Pryatd, 
many of those funds are ear-
marked for specific commitments. 
About $50 million is earmarked to 
pay debt service on buildings, $41 
million is set aside to spend on 

"So, you can see that a lot of 
that money starts disappearing 
pretty fast," she said. 

In addition, state law mandates 
that many operations, such as 
housing and dining, do not tum a 
profit, meaning that many of the 
surpluses that show up in the 
report cannot be used to compen-
sate for state budget cuts in other 

areas. 
"If you have a revenue stream 

for parking, you have to cover its 
costs," Pryatel said. "And auxil -
iaries are not supposed to make 
money other than to cover their 
own costs. We're not allowed to 
go out and make a profit, per se.

FEe records show 
$45,274 in gifts to Dean 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Staff Writer 

Employees of the UC system 
have donated at least $45,274 to 
Fmr. Vermont Gov. Howard 
Dean's campaign, nearly the 
amount they gave to all other 
presidential candidates com-
bined, Federal Election 
Commission records show. 

The sum means that the 
University ofCalifomia is Dean's 
second-largest contributor, 
behind TIme-Warner, parent 
company of AOL and CNN, 
accordinJ to the nonpartisan 
Center for Reapomive Politics, 
which trac:b c:ampeip money. 

Dean receiYed 111 out of 193 
contributions made by UC 
employees, followed by Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mau.), who had 23 
contributions 10IIlinJ $17,065. 

-It's a sip of the emaordi-
nary suc:ceu that Dean hu had

that e haven't tapped very 
well before,· Gary Jac:obIon, a 
UCSD poIitic:al ICienc:c profa-
lor and campeip &naoc:e expert 
aid. "He's been able to raise 

money from folks who haven't 
in the past contributed. And that 
has been the source of some of 
the success he's had at the pre-
sent time." 

In fact, in addition to the 
University of California, employ-
ees of six other university systems 
represent six of Dean's top 20 
contributors, according to the 
CRP. 

"I think that what you see is 
that university professors nation-
wide have contributed to this 

. campaign in large numbers 
because they are uniquely inter-
ested in issues of social justice, 
civil rights and social rights that 
Governor Dean is talking about," 
Dean campaign spokesman 
Garrett Graff said.

BAC 
develops 
building 

plans 
By MEAGHAN FIELD 

Staff Writer 

Building Advisory Committee 
meetings in January have brought 
new decisions in the plans of the 
Price Center expansion. Although 
no plans have been finalized, archi-
tecture finn Cannon Design has 
been selected to incorporate many 
of the new plans. 

Much of the BAC's discussion 
has revolved around placement on 
each floor. According to the BACt 
the ground floor is the most impor-
tantto retail and food services, as it 
offers students easy access. 

According to Max Harrington, 
ERC sophomore senator and BAC 
board member, one proposed plan 
makes the tint and second floors 
into "ground floors," depending on 
the side from which the building is 
approached. 

"Because we are working on a 
sloped site, it is therefore difficult 
to define a specific 'ground floor' 
- this is why both the first and 
second levels of the expansion are 
being seen as pernaps equally 
important," Harrington said. "You

I BRIEFLY 
uc signs one-year contract 
extension on Berkeley lab 

The University of California signed a one-
year extension on Jan. 30 to continue man-
aging the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory on behalf of the U.s. Department 
of Energy. 

The university has managed the laboratory 
through a series of contract extensions since 
October 2002. The most recent was set to 
expire on Jan. 31 . 

Recent congressional action has mandat-
ed that the D.O.E. conduct a competition for 
the laboratories under the university's man-
agement, which includes Los Alamos 
National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory, but the D.O.E. has not 
yet announced detailed plans for the compe-
tition. 

Once the D.O.E. releases its request for 
proposals, the UC Board of Regents are 
expected to make decisions regarding whether 
the university will compete for the Berkeley 
laboratory. 

The UC Regents have given UC President 
Robert C. Dynes authority to extend operating 
contracts for all three national laboratories. 

The University of California has mana~ed 
the Berkeley laboratory since the lab's inception 
in 1931. 

The laboratory currently performs research 
in nanoscience and advanced materials, the life 
sciences, computing. earth sciences, physics 
and cosmology, as well as operating a 
Department of Homeland Security office.

BAC: Ground floor plans debated 
cOnlinued from page r 

can start at one end of the building, walk to 
the other end without changing floors, and 
end up on a level that is technically different 
than the one you started on. Not only does 
this allow us to design the building so that 
the second floor will be just as busy as the 
first, but it will make the building more 
interesting and interactive for those who are 
walking through it." 

The necessity for easy student access to 
the building makes parking and the shuttle 
issues to the. BAC's planning. Earlier plans 
to move the shuttle stop underground have 
been abandoned, but two other plans still 
remain in development. The first plan 
would move the shuttle stop to another 
location, allowing for more room for the 
expansion. 

According to Harrington, the proposal 
would reduce the cost of the expansion bud-
get mitigate potential traffic problems on 
Matthews Lane. The disadvantage would be 

a potential inconvenience to students, 
depending on where the stop was moved. 

The second plan would move the shuttle 
stop slightly to the east, in the spot where 
the ATMs are currently located. 

Cannon has proceeded with plans for 
each scenario. 

"I think the BAC needs additional infor-
mation that we do not yet have - for exam-
ple, the results of a traffic study, as well as 
continued consultation with the Planning 
Advisory Committee [studying the overall 
pattern of shuttle traffic]. Right now, I think 
it could go either way," Harrington said. 

Another plan in the works is the Gilman 
Bridge, which would extend Gilman Drive 
across Interstate 5, changing the way 
Regents Parking and East Parking are con-
nected with the rest of campus. The changes 
possible with this bridge are important in

Revenue: 'Imagine What's Next' raises $560.5 million, aims for $1 billion 
continued from page r 

We have to make enough so we 
could cover future costs." 

Nonetheless, UCSD has imple-
mented several initiatives to help 
compensate for falling state rev-
enues, which decreased by $21 
rllillion last year. In response to 
state budget cuts, UCSD launched 
"The Campaign for UCSD: 
Imagine What's Next" in March 
2000, with a goal of raising $1 bil-
lion in private donation for creat-
ing student scholarships, attracting 
faculty, improving academic pro-
grams and furthering research . 
The campaign has already raised 
$560.5 million, including the 
recently announced $30 rllillion 
contribution by Er.nest Rady for 
Rady School of Management. The 
principal donor to the fund has 
been the UCSD Foundation, a pri-
vate nonprofit organization that 
solicits and manages private gifts 

to UCSD. The foundation has 
raised $92 million over the past 
two years for various programs on 
campus. 

"The UCSD Foundation is a 
very broad support program," 
UCSD Foundation Chief Financial 
Officer Marlene Shaver said. "The 
lion's share of the gifts that are 
given to the foundation are restrict-
ed 'by the donors. So the donors 
choose where the gifts go. Every 
area of campus has received gifts .. . 
[We've supported] everything 
imaginable under the sun." 

Shaver is optimistic about 
UCSD's ability to raise funds to help 
compensate for falling state support. 

"Giving for the university has 
been g9ing up for years," Shaver 
said. "Many years in a row our 
development staff has grown. 
We're in a campaign mode - the 
generosity of donors has grown and 
the campus has many friends and 

family." 
In another effort to cut costs 

and increase efficiencies, the 
UCSD Office of Business Affairs, 
in conjunction with UCLA and UC 
Santa Cruz, is developing an elec-
tronic marketplace for faculty to 
purchase supplies and equipment. 

Despite the budget cuts, UCSD 
has maintained its historically 
strong growth in research. 
Research expenditures increased 
by $32 rllillion in 2003. According 
to the report, UCSD School of 
Medicine has the highest grant-to-
faculty ratio among medical 
schools in the nation, and Jacobs 
School of Engineering has the sec-
ond highest grant to faculty ratio 
in the nation. 

"Last year our grant funding 
was up 25 percent," director of 
heath sciences communications 
Leslie Franz said. "So we're trend-
ing very favorably."

that will last many many years with 
the help of ... countless students." 

After approximately 300 A.S. 
Council meetings, DeWine says his 
decision to leave Associated Students 
is based on his desire to grow profes-
sionally and seek new experiences. 

"If I had to pick a number-on~ 
mentor, a number-one person to 
help transition ... from nothing .. . 
to being a senator, Paul would be 
the number-one guy," Earl Warren 
College Freshman Senator Erik 
Ward said. 

Like many councilmembers who 
spoke at DeWine's final Council' 
meeting, Ward described DeWine 
as a living historian who knows 
precedents and wants to help in any 

way possible. 
"The thing that I love is seeing 

A.S. when they 
succeed; the 
ownership, the 
excitement and 
the fulfillment 
they get from 
seemg some-
thing that they 
worked so hard 
on come into 
fruition ... and 
enjoy the fruits 
of their labor," 
DeWine said.

"We're very excited that he's 

going to be joining our staff and he 
is exceptionally qualified to take on 
the responsibilities of the assistant 
dean's position here at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College," Scott said . 
"The experience and expertise that 
he has in leadership development 
and student governance combined 
with his commionent to communi-
ty service resonates exceptionally 
with what the mission of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College is all about." 

David Goodwin, chair of the 
Eleanor Roosevelt College Student 
Council, said it's thrilling to have 
DeWine at ERe. 

"We're very happy to have an 
assistant dean, and more important-

Iy, we're very happy to have Paul 
being that assistant dean," Goodwin 
said. "He definitely has given a lot of 
service to A.S. and I'm sure he will 
be sorely missed up there, but I 
think he will go on to do even 
greater things in different places." 

DeWine described the most dif-
ficult aspect of being A.S. Council 
is advisor was negotiating how to 
relate to each council. 

"I've always felt that my role is 
to help them make an informed 
decision, to make sure they have all 
the facts," DeWine said. "And 
whatever decision they make from 
there, it's their decision." 

Ward, though he has only 
served on the A.S. Council for one-
and-a-half quarters, expressed that 

VERONICA GUERIN 

he will rlliss DeWine very much. 
"I can't even try and think of 

how these third-and fourth-years

now," Ward said. 

DeWine grew up in Ohio and 
attended the U niversity of 
Toledo. He rcceived a masters 
degree in college student person-
nel from Bowling Green Sta te 
Universiry. Before becoming A.S. 
advisor at UCSD, DeWine 
worked with student organiza-
tions with an emphasis on frater -
nities and sororities. 

"I think there's a new excite-
ment at Roosevelt because of the 
new college campus ... and I think 
it's going to be fun to be 3 part of 
that," DeWine said.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

IDiversityl has an unusual connotation in college 
Self'imposed segregation more common than inter .. culture learning 
Returned 
Yank 

Chris Taylor 

T he idea of race did not occur to me until college. As odd as that seems now, 
it's true, at least in terms of how 
race is taught in universities . My 
parents were large supporters of 
complete color blindness, some-
thing leftists foolishly denounce. 
They taught me to judge people 
by the content of their character 
and not by the color of their skin, 
which, through the years, I did my 
best to accomplish. 

I've already witnessed conde-
scension toward this view in eth-
nic studies courses. The profes-
sors and TAs are convinced that 
the only reason I was indi fferent 
to race was because obviously the 
"people of color" in my life were 
"white-washed" or sel",ctively dis-
sociating from their race. 

It is frustrating to respond to 
this son of ignorance, bur neces- . 
sary. My best friends in high 
school were Din and Suare7., 
from Colombia and Cuba, respec-
tively, and both spoke only 
Spanish at home, Both were 
proud of thCi r heritage. I under-
stood their respective cultures ' 
were different, but it had nothing 
to do with skin color, IJ anything, 

Ne 

I was jealous that they were bilin-
gual, and I was not, I never placed 
them into racial categories, even 
subconsciously. And I certainly 
did not pick them as friends 
because I had some fabricated idea 
of racial quotas in my friend-
selection process. 

So it was only upon my arrival 
at UCSD that I was taught that 
race should be a deciding factor in 
my judgment of peers. From that 
moment, professors and coun-
selors talked about the values of 
diversity but only offered clubs 
and activities for "ethnic" groups, 
which definitely do not include 
whites. It's hard to "fit in" with 
slogans lilce that of MEChA: "Por 
la raza, todo. Fuera de la raza, 
nada." (For "the race," every-
thing. For those outside the race, 
nothing.) 

I realized that diversity was a 
crock according to the university'S 
standards , Diversity, which is sup-
posed to supplement everyone's 
education through interaction 
wi th different cultures, is actually 
manifested by pockets of self-
serving students who stay with 
their ethnic group, show a lot of 
pride, and refuse to interact with 
other ethn ic groups. 

I greatly support the idea of 
diversity. In fact, few things are 
more rewarding in life than inter-
acting with' different cultures and 
languages, I quickly learned that 
this is not how UCSD college stu-
dents function . First-year friends 
of mine, who were nearly all 
Indian, learned quickly that their 

bea 

true place was among other 
Indians, not with white folk - or 
any other race for that matter. 
Their rejection of all other ethnic 
groups occurred in an astounding-
ly short number of weeks. While 
they represented a small number 
of students, their attitude was 
absolutely indicative of the larger 
problem. 

Suddenly, it was clear that the 
practical application of diversity 
does not actually mean learning 
about other cultures. This is 
solidly verified by such atrocities 
as cultural graduations, wherein 
diversity has so run amok that we

'aren't even supposed to graduate 
with other races. If this is not seg-
regation, nothing is. 

Despite the undeniable plight 
of minorities, it is truly a no-win 
situation for white students on 
campus. Anything with "white" in 
the· title either has to be in the 
context of "evil white men ruling 
the country" or "dead misogynist

white men" taught in humanities. 
There is no club or resource for 
"white" students because white is 
the only race that has no ethnici-
ty, 

And no matter what dis-
claimers are used, almost every 
class blames all the world's prob-
lems on "whi te men." "White 
men" has become a catch-all for 
bad guys, rich and slimy, exploit-
ing the world. Whether or not 
this is true doesn't ma tter. To be a 
white student sitting in class and 
hearing this mantra repeated ad 
nauseum imbues a sense of self-
loathing which is hard to shake. 

It doesn't help that students 
even go so far as to spread racism 
themselves. It's e~sy to mention 
The Koala, but at least they are 
self-proclaimed "equal-opportu-
nity" racists. Much more sinister 
are examples like the New 
indicator column stating that all 
white students are racist. There is 
also the ever-blatant and present 
racism of the Voz Fronteriza. 
These examples have been men-
tioned in this column before and 
will be repeated so that they may 
not be forgotten . 

One response to this attack on 
the Voz was that, despite racist 
undertones against whites, histor-
ical precedence excuses these 
groups because they are minori -
ties and have borne the brunt of 
more discrimination than whites 
ever have. 

It is truly ironic knowing that 
the beacons of intelligence in our 
country excuse racism because of 

historical precedence. It is ironic 
to understand that white srudents 
will receive no help in times of 
racism, even if they have never 
had a racist thought in their life. A 
history of racism from one group 
does not eternally justify racism 
against innocents of that group 
now. , 

But in the end, there is no plea 
for a "white" club or "white" 
resource center. Certainly, there is 
no need for pity or even action to 
correct these petty injustices. It is 
only disheartening that many 
white students will learn that we 
must judge people based on the 
color of their skin. Don 't you 
know? It's wrong to be blind to 
color! Or at least that's what my 
professor said . 

And somehow, by bad luck and 
a bit of "historical precedence," 
white students have ended up on 
the wrong side. It is dishearten ing 
that homegrown ideas, such as 
judging people by the quality of 
their character, are so despised in 
the name of academia and fake 
diversity. 

For me, the saddest day was 
the day I returned home to meet 
with my best friends from high 
school. Because of the constant 
indoctrination of racial quotas and 
segregation, I saw.them not as my 
best friend s, but as racial ca te-
gories. Shame 01'\ me.

Out of Africa Campaign: UC second in Dean donations

employer. 

The most generous contribu-
tor was UC Irvine physics profes-
sor Reiley Newman, whose family 
spread six separate contributions 
among four different Democratic 
contenders. 

"We were particularly interest-
ed in nominating a Democratic 
candidate who'd be successful in 
this year's election," Newman 
said. 

President George W. Bush 
recei ved two contri butions, -total -
ing $1,250. The amount is less 
than Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), 
who ended his bid for the 
D emocratic nomination in 
October 2003. 

Bush's low contributions indi-
cates a different fundraising strat-
egy, focused primarily on bigger 
donors who can afford to attend 
"$ I ,OOO-per-head dinners," 
Jacobson said. He also believes the 
figures have been influenced by 
UC professors' ideological lean-
ings. 

"[Bush] is going to get some 
votes from the -UC, but he is not 
very popular among faculty 
types," Jacobson said. 

According to Jacobson, Dean's 
opposition to the war in Iraq has 
made him a popular pick among 
academia. 

"Opponents of the war are 
also concentrated among people 
with high levels of education. 
The UC has a lot of people who 
are part of his natural constituen-
cy and he has managed to tap 
into that group," Jacobson said. 
"He was the most prominent 
critic of the administration, and 
that's the message that resonates 
among liberal Democrats in

Professors may also not be 

considering whether Dean could 
win in a general election, an issue 
that has hurt him among other

made him sort of the darling of 
liberals, especia lly those not very 
much concerned with his elec-
tability - and I think professors 
probably fit into the realm of peo-
ple who are generally more liberal 
than the general population and 
people who don't think incredibly 
pragmatically about politics," 
Kousser said. 

In 2000, UC employees gave 
AI Gore $63,245 during the 
course of his entire campaign, and 
UC employees and immediate 
family members contributed less 
than $13,250 to President Bill 
Clinton's re-election campaign, 
according to the CRP. 

UCSD physics professor 
Clifford Surko, who gave money 
to a Democratic contender, 
believes that the large number of 
candidates vying for the 
Democratic nomination - as 
many as II at one point - has 
allowed them to appeal to a larger 
variety of voters. 

"It was a very broad field, so 
you could see that your contribu-
tion could help define the direc-
tion that the Democratic Party 
went," Surko said. 

Contribution data examined 
comprised of all digital FEC 
records available as of Jan. 26, 
which include campaign contribu-
tions through September 2003 . 
The FEC only keeps track of 
donations over $200. 

A September field poll indicat-
ed a 14 percent support for Dean 
among likely voters in California's 
Democratic primary, yet Dean 
received 44.7 percent of UC con-
tributions. Front-runner Gen. 
Wesley Clark, who at the time led 
with 17 percent in ¢ e poll, 
received only 2.7 percent, or 
$2,750, ofUC money. 

Kousser blamed Clark's poor 
showing on his eleventh-hour 
entry .into the race and a late start 
in fundraising. 

Compared to most other can-
didates, Dean's support has come 
from far smaller donations, wi th 
$408 as the average contribution. 
The figure is far below Kerry's 
mean of $742 and Sen. Joe 
Lieberman's (D-Conn.) average of 
$1,054, who received $)4,750 
from the university's employees. 

Clark was the only candidate to 
receive UC employees' contribu-
tions smaller than Dean's, averag-
ing $275 . Rev. AI Sharpton and 
former Ambassador Carol 
Moseley Braun received nothing. 

Four of nine donations made to 
Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), a 
former trial lawyer, came from 
professors working at one of the 
UC's law schools, including $500 
from the . dean of UC Hastings 
College of Law and $250 from an 
assistant dean at UCLA School of 
Law. Edwards received a total of 
$4,750. 

Despite their second-place 
standing among Dean contribu-
tors, the money given by UC 
employees represents a tiny frac -
tion of the estimated $41 million 
Dean raised by the end of last year. 
Jacobson does not think the 
amount will give the university 
political influence should Dean 
make it to the White House. 

"1 think the amount of money, 
as a tota I that he needs to run, is so 
small that it really makes little dif-
ference," he said. "I'm sure Dean 
is happy to get the money, but it's 
not a magnificent sum. 

Both Newman and Surko said 
that candidates' higher education 
policy did not play a significant 
role in choosing to a candidate to 
donate to. 

"[My and my family's] main 
concern was foreign policy, and we 
take the view that this country 
should work together closely with 
other countries in handling envi-
ronmental and other international 
issues," Newman said. "With our 
contributions we included letters 
saying that we were particularly 
concerned with their foreign poli-
cy objectives."

the third locates it somewhere in

According to Harrington, 
although the building plans are 
coming along well, there is still 
room for improvement in the 
BAC's process. His major concern 
is the lack of student participation 
in the BAC. The referendum guar-
anteed that the board would be 
made up of two-thirds student 
members, but according to 
Harrington, few students attend 
the meetings. 

His recommendations to fix this 
problem are to malce the BAC a 
more welcoming place by schedul-
ing the meeting times when stu-
dents are most likely to be able to 
come, malcing sufficient appoint-
ment of student representatives 
and increasing public outreach. 
These recommendations have been 
submitted, but not yet addressed. 

Textbooks: Report calls for pricing reforms 

continued /rom page r 
for in-state students at public four-
year colleges. According to statis-
tics from the UC Office of the 
President, students' textbook costs 
have increased by 24 percent since 

- 1996-97. 
uI think there is definitely a con-

sensus that buying books is totally 
insane," Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Sarah Piazza said, 
Piazza said rising prices forced her 
to share boob and to use the 
Ii brary for class readin gs. 

The report claims that publish-
ing companies use various practices 
to increase textbook costs. For 
example, half of all texts now come 
"bundled" with additional instruc-
tional materials such as,CD-ROMs 
and supplemental workbooks. The 
report found · the practice of 
bundling boob with other materi-
als increased by 21 percent between 
consecutive editions of the books 
surveyed. The number of bundled 
items increased by nearly 50 per-
cent. 

Sixty-five percent of the faculty 
surveyed said they rarely use these 
materials for their courses. 

A chemistry textbook for a UC 
Santa B~rbara course published by 
Pearson Education was the only 
book surveyed that was available 
both bundled and unbundled. In 
this case, the bundled version was 
more than twice as expensive as the 
unbundled version. 

Publishers release new editions 
of textbooks on an average of every 
three to four years. These new edi-
tions contain very few content 
changes, according to the report. 
For example, a comparison of the 
2003 and 1999 editions of 
"Calculus; Early Transcendentals" 
published by Thomson Learning 
reveals that the only changes were 
several new math problems, 

rearrangement and consolidation 
of chapters, and an added CD-
ROM and workbook. The average 
price for the new edition is $130, 
while a used copy of the older edi-
tion sells for anywhere between 
$20 to $90. 

According to UCSD mathemat-
ics professor Gaemus Collins, the 
frequency of new editions of math 
textbooks is unnecessary. 

"Calculus is an old field - it 
hasn't changed for over 100 years," 
Collins said. "AI though the 
methodology for calculus does 
change, it can't justify new editions 
every four years." 

Of the facul ty surveyed, 76 per-
cent reported that new textbook 
editions are justified "never" to 
"half the time" justified. 
Moreover, when publishers release 
new editions, older versions are 
forced off the markets, making 
cheaper used textbooks unavail-
able. Of the surveyed students, 59 
percent who searched for a used 
book in fall of 2003 were unable to 
find even one used text for any of 
their classes. 

"It's appalling that at a time 
when students are contending with 
rapidly rising college costs, text-
book publishers are playing games 
to increase textbook prices," 
Reents said. 

CalPIRG is also concerned 
over the price differences between 
the same textbooks sold in the 
United States and overseas. For 
example, the cost of the fifth edi-
tion of "Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals" for students in 
the United States is S122. In com-
parison, the cost of the same boole 
for Canadian students is $96, and 
the cost for British students is 
S59. 

uThe most glaring problem I 
see is the [price] differential 

between U.S. and overseas ver-
sions," Collins said. 

According to Jeremy Cogan, 
A.S. commissioner of enterprise 
operations, [he CalPIRG report 
emphasizes that rising textbook 
costs are not due to students, facul -
ty or even administration, but to 
problems within the publishing 
industry. 

"The report confirmed a lot of 
suspicions.l had as an individual, 
and I think that a lot of students on 
this campus believe that their 
problems are individual prob-
lems," Cogan said. "They really 
don't believe that their problems 
are part of a larger problem in gen-
eral ... it's part of a problematic 
structure in the publishing indus-
try that students have no control 
over." 

The report malees several policy 
recommendations to address the 
issue of textbook prices. Among the 
suggestions is that publishers 
should work to keep the cost of 
their boolcs as low as possible, and 
should offer texts in both bundled 
and unbundled versions. It suggest-
ed that publishers should also 
inform faculty about all text 
options, costs, shelf life, and the 
differences between subsequent 
editions of the same textbooks. It 
also recommends using paper or 
online supplements to current edi-
tions, instead of publishing com-
pletely new editions. 

The report further suggests that 
colleges set up programs for stu-
dents to ,share, buy and sell books. 
CalPIRG has set up its own non-
profit online bookswap at 
bttp:llwww.cflmpusbookrwflp.com. 
Cogan said A.S. is also working on 
a partnership with 
booltSWICampUS.com to provide a site 
where students call purchase and 
sell books for a small transaction 
fee . According to Cogan, the 
advantage of the site is that there 
are no shipping charges, since stu-
dents can arrange to meet on cam-
pus to exchange books. 

"It's the first time in about 14 
years that any attempt has been 
done by the Associated Students to 
start a new, entrepreneurial busi-
ness relationship," Cogan said. 

Legislators nationwide are also 
getting involved with the issue. 
Rep. David Wu (D-Ore.) and Sen. 
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) have 
both introduced legislation to 
investigate the practices of the pub-
lishing industry in their respective 
states. In California, Carol Liu, 
chair of the California Assembly of 
Higher Education Subcommittee, 
is also scheduled to introduce legis-
lation. 

"I want to thanlc CalPIRG for 
educating the public about the high 
price of college textbooks and I 
look forward to continuing the 
fight on behalf of our students to 
make college more affordable for 
families," Wu said.

A new New Year's resol ution 

RII\I.\C 

1\ I. \1 N GYl\1 

-A-beginner's guide to 
getti ng in shape at 
UCSO's gym_s and 
recreation classes 

H · as your annual New Year's resolution to get in shape already been left in the dust? Now that schedules have 
settled into place, adding exercise to your 
daily routine is simple and worth the extra 
effort. 

"It is included in tuition, which is a great 
perk," Candice Bae, an ' Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore, said. '10ining a gym off 
campus would be a lot more expensive. I don't 
have a car, so transponation would also be a 
problem." 

C\N"\ ONYII· \\" 
Terri Dowie, director of UCSD's Personal 

Wellness Program, recommends that every-
one check out the gym because of its numer-
ous benefits and minimal risks. A consistent 
workout routine can lead to increases in 
speed, strength and power. Exercising can 
relieve stress, increase energy and help you 
lose weight. In addition, regular exercise pre-
vents . injuiries, increasing bone density and 
tendon and ligament strength. To get started 
on your work out plan, explore the variety of 
options available on campus. 

RIMAC's state-of-the-art weight room is 
equipped with a large free-weight area, a core 
training section and over 40 cardiovascular 
exercise machines. The facility also offers 
basketball and racquetball courts. 

Facilities 
UCSD offers a variety of options at little 

or no extra cost to students. With tuition get-
ting fatter each day, getting your money's 
worth ftom UCSD's resources seems like a 
good idea. 

"They have very clean facilities," Bae said. 
"The equipment is top-of-the-line, which 
makes it easier to work out there. It is open 
and airy, and the 1Vs make the time pass 
quickly. There is enough equipment there for 
everyone, so you don't have to spend the 
whole time waiting, which is nice because you 
don't want to waste your time - you are 
there to work out." 

The smaller Main Gym, located near 
Student Center, has a good mix of weight 
training and cardio machines. There is also a 
large gymnastic workout area and the 
Natatorium, a heated six-lane indoor swim-

m.ing pool. 
Canyonview Pool at Earl Warren College 

boasts an olltdoor, heated Olympic-size pool 
that includes one- and three-meter divi ng 
boards (the five-meter is only open to UCSD 
athletics). The facility also has a small weight 
room and an indoor climbing center. The 
climbing center is designed with beginners in 
mind, making this a nice option to add diver-
sity to your workout. Though it docs cost 
some money, an all-day pass with equipment 
rental is less than $10. 

Recreation Classes 
Recreation classes are a good option for 

those who need group motivation and a fun 
environment to work out in. Although some 
classes are offered exclusively at an intermedi-
ate or advanced level, most offer a beginner's 
class as well and are led by helpful instructors. 
With dozens of choices ranging from yoga to 
Argentine tango to surfing, it is nearly impos-
sible to not fmd a class that fits your interests.

Students found new 
investment society 
Organization educates on 

matters of personal finance 
lay USA MAIC 

Staff Writer 

The world of finance and 
invesonent can be a tricky one to 
navigate, especially for those with 
little or no real experience. Savings, 
property, stock markets, portfolios 
and business are all areas that 
require time and effort to learn 
how to manage. The recently stu-
dent founded Undergraduate 
1nvesonem Society offers students, 
including graduate students, from 
aU majors and with all levels of 
experience a chance to develop 
their financial techniques and 
skills, 

"The purpose of this club is to 
educate and empower our mem-
bers with financial knowledge," 
UIS president Ann Ko said, "Our 
targeted audience is anybody who 
has the general interest and desire 
to learn about the financial market, 
investi g, personal finance or 
career preparation," 

The major purpose ofUIS is to 
help students prepare for money 
management and imoestmem both 
in college and after graduation. In 
addition to financial knowledge, 
the organization emphasizes lead-
ership, teamwork and problem-
solving skills that are applicable to 
real-world situations. 

"Our goal as an organization is 
to give the students at UCSD help 
in taking the first steps to become 
independent when dealing with 
their finances," UIS vice president 
Sunali Chokshi said. "No one 
wants to be told what to do with 
their money, but neither does any-
one want to make a mistake and 
lose their savings because they had 
no experience in dealing with 
finance." 

Students pay a 515 annual 
membership fee to take advantage 
of the programs offered by UIS. 
The club provides informative 
workshops, which cover topics such 
as investment basics, personal 
finance, career preparation, and 
resume/interview preparation, The 
first such workshop took place on 
Jan, 22 and covered investment 
basics and techniques for invest-
ment analysis. 

"The first workshop was infor-
mative and a good start," said Amar 
B. Doshi, an electrical and comput-
er engineering graduate student, 
"Personally, I'd like to see more 
workshops that are in-depth and 
non rushed about the basics of 
interpreting financial data." 

In addition to workshops, UIS 
will also host a series of guest 
speakers who are professionals 
from the fields of investment, 
finance and business. The speak-
ers will discuss topics such as pri-
vate equity, investment manage-
ment and venture capitalism. For 
its first speaking event on Jan. 29, 
the club invited Dave Molnar, sec-
ond vice president of the financial 
firm Smith Barney, to share his 
insights on private wealth man-
agement. 

Workshops and guest speakers 
alternate each week with general 
body meetings, and the club also 
plans social events to allow mem-
bers to share information and 
develop networking connections. 

"Becoming a member is defi-
nitely a worthwhile investment," 
Ko said. "The knowledge that is 
obtained through our events will 
be beneficial to our members 
whether it be in the work force, or 
if they just wanted to invest their 
money in the stock market as a 
hobby." 

UIS will also provide internship 
opportunities to members through 
its corporate connections. 
According to Ko, the club's corpo-

rate contacts include Mission 
Ventures, Smith Barney and other 
financial finns. 

The UIS was founded partly 
because there was no other similar 
financial organization on campus 
that addressed the questions and 
needs of students from all academ-
ic backgrounds and with all levels 
of investment experience. 

"We realized that there wasn't 
really a club out there targeted 
toward investing," said Kevin 
Jiang, the club's director of tech-
nologies. "We wanted our club to 
be open to all rna jors and people, 
unlike some business clubs that 
want only business and economics 
majors." 

Another advantage of the orga-
nization is that several of its officers 
have investment experience and are 
interning at companies that pro-
vide them with a unique financial 
perspective. 

For example, Chokshi currently 
holds an internship in the Space 
Technology Sector at the global 
defense company Northrop 
Grumman and has been investing 
for four years. Jiang has been 
investing his money as a hobby for 
about three years. 

As a third-year premedical bio-
engineering major, he interns at 
Syrrx, a start-up drug discovery 
company. 

"My internship at Syrrx has 
actually helped me with my finan-
cial experience since people I work 
with are all avid investors," Jiang 
said. 

According to both Jiang and 
Ko, the main problems students 
have with managing their finances 
are inexperience and lack of under-
standing. 

"Some general tips I would 
offer other college students about 
investing is to always remember to 
invest what you can afford to lose 
[and) to continually seek for more 
knowledge and experience in the 
investment world, for it may help 
layout your financial future," Ko 
said. 

Student responses to the club 
and its activities have been posi-
tive. Some have emphasized the 
benefits of discussing financial 
topics in order .to learn and 
exchange ideas. 

"I've been looking for a good 
place to gain knowledge about per-
sonal finance and investing theory," 
Doshi said. "Although a lot of 
information in tenns of reading 
books and on the Internet is avail-
able, I think this type of ,a discus-
sion and live forum like UIS is a 
better way to stan learning the fun-
damentals. " 

Others have focused on the 
practical, real-world application of 
concepts and techniques presented 
by the organization. 

"I think UIS is a step forward 
in terms of giving students a 
financial education," student 
member Vinit Modi said. "The 
topics covered arc very common, 
and one comes across them every 
day on the news. I gain a lot of 
insight into the operations of the 
real world and I can relate what I 
learned to the markets." 

Overall, UIS seeks to make the 
world of finance a little less confus-
ing and less impenetrable for col-
lege students. 

"We are giving the students of 
UCSD some Wall Street smarts 
and hoping that they can take away 
some beneficial knowledge about 
what to do with their money," 
Chokshi said, 

The UIS is always recruiting 
new members and all arc welcome.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FEATURES It 

Fitness: Personal trainer recommends sampling weight routines 
continued from page 9 

"They offer a lot of classes tha t 1 
am interested in," Lindsay Young, 
a John Muir College sophomore, 
said. "1 really like yoga and surfing 
and am glad they offer them, They 
have great instructors, and this 
makes me want to take more class-
es." 

Recreation classes provide alter-
native sources of exercise for those 
who may not be interested in the 
traditional running or weight lift-
ing regimen, 

"These programs make for a 
good workout, and they are a dif-
ferent kind of exercise from the 
usual treadmill, so you don't get 
tired of the same thing, day-in and 
day-out," Young said. 

For many students, these classes 
also provide an opportunity to get 

away from their difficult workload. 
I t is a chance to do something fun 
with friends and provides a much-
welcomed break from stressful 
classes, not to mention great health 
benefits, 

"Surfing is a lot of fun and great 
exercise," Young said. "Also, my 
yoga class is very relaxing and gives 
me a sense of inner peace. It helps 
in counteracting the stress brought 
on by school. They are fun activi-
ties to do with my friends." 

For some, the best part of taking 
recreation classes lies in the low 
cost. The administration offers a 
discount on nearly all classes for 
UCSD students with a valid identi-
fication ca.rd. In addition, there are 
a few classes offered each quaner 
such as beginning kickboxing that 
are free for UCSD students. The 

Rachel A. Garcia/Coordian 
Main Gym: Though smaller than RIMAe, Main Gym's weight room offers a good 
selection of cardio and weight machines with fewer people in line for a turn, 

low, or sometimes non-existent, 
cost to take these classes allows you 
to get more out of the UCSD cam-
pus, 

"It's a good way to try new 
things, since they have special stu-
dent rates, which allow you to not 
feel guilty about spending money 
on something you might or might 
not like," Young said. 

Sample a weight routine 
Dowie, who also trains UCSD's 

NCAA athletes and has been a per-
sonal trainer for 17 years, empha-
sized that weightlifting is the best 
.thing for men and women who 
wish to lose weight and keep it off. 

"Increasing your lean muscle 
mass will increase your metabo-
lism," Dowie said, "The more lean 
muscle mass you have, the more 
calories you'll burn in a day." 

Dowie recommends that begin-
ners hit the gym two or three times 
a week to start. Overdoing it in the 
beginning can make you burn out. 

"Good training advice in the 
beginning is the key to success, n 
she said. "People get too sore in the 
beginning and quit. Moderation, 
consistency and slowly working up 
to .heavier weights will help you 
stay with it, Consistency is very 
important." 

Start with some sort of aerobic 
exercise for 20 to 30 minutes to get 
the blood flowing and to improve 
your cardiovascular system. Next, 
do a full body workout on the cir-
cuit weight machines. Two sets of 
10 to 12 repetitions at a moderate 
weight are enough. 

The last thing to do is take 10 
minutes at the end to stretch out. 
Stretching is very important and 
should not be skipped because it 
reduces soreness and helps to pre-
vent injury. It is done last because 
you need to be warmed up before 
you srretch. 

"Good form with weights is 
everything," said Dowie. 

Good form include good pos-
ture - you should never arch your 
back when lifting. Also, be sure to 
remember to breathe, The proper 
technique is to exhale when you are 
contracting the muscle and inhale 
as you rerum to starting pos.ition. A 
common mistake is to lift the 

weight too quickly. 
Dowie recominends going at a 

slower pace, taking about four sec-
onds per repetition, squeezing your 
muscles when they arc fully con-
tracted. 

Regarding safety, one should 
never feel pain in a joint, Watch out 
for numbness, extreme tightness or 
shooting pain - all of these mean 
you should put the weights down, 
Some moderate soreness is a1l right 
as long as it does not last longer 
than 48 hours. Always remember to 
be realistic and know your capabil-
ities. 

Free training advice for students 
Students may drop into the 

RIMAe weight room on Fridays 
from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m, and talk to 
one of the personal trainers for 
free , However, if you want extend-
ed help, you may need to buy some 
time with a personal trainer, Prices 
are 535 for one hour or $52.50 for 
two hours if it is your first time. 

Another option that is free to 
students IS the Student Wellness 
Program, This program is offered 
through the recreation department 
and accepts 60 applicants on a first-
come, first-serve basis at the end of 
each quarter for the next quarter\; 
program, During the program, sru-
dents meet once a week in small 
groups of five or six with a person-
al trainer to cover a new topic. 

The rrainers that are involved 
with the Srudent Well ness Program 
are top-of-the-line, Laura Behr was 
a collegiate rower at Purdue 
University, Nick Skvarna is the 
women's soccer coach at San Diego 
City College, and Terry Martin 
recently won first place in her age 
group in a Hawaiian Irorunan com-
petition. 

Also included in the program is a 
nutrition talk with dietitian Heather 
McCracken . Individual nutrition 
counseling is also available outside of 
the Srudent Wcllness Program, free 
of charge to srudems. Contact 
McCracken at mn((7'ockf11@lIcsd,edll

said. "Our main scorers weren't 
getting their baskets, and the 
bench players helped pick up the 
slack." 

The lead began to dwindle 
when halftime approached, as 
Sonoma State went on a 6-0 run to 
cut the lead to two points. They 
eventually managed to tie it with 
less than a minute left in the half, 
but a bucket by junior center Stacy 
Bolton-Gallagher gave the Tritons 
a twO point lead heading int9 the 
locker room. 

The Tritons again had strong 
play in the opening part of the half 
as they went on an 8-0 run to take 
the lead at 44-3 4 with 13 minutes 
remaining. Phillips and junior for-
ward Katie McGann each poured 
in four points. 

Sonoma State stopped the 
blc;eding quickly and within min-
utes had put together a 13 -0 run to 
take their first lead of the night at 
47-44. Aiding Sonoma State's run 
was Johnson's foul trouble. 
Johnson picked up her fourth foul 
of the game early in the second half 
and had to remain out of the game 
until the end. 

"It hurt having her out," Ginn 
said. "Our team goes along with 
how Margaret goes. If she's playing 
well, we're all playing well ." 

T he teams battled back and 
forth and began to exchange free 
throws. Sonoma State had the lead 
at Ii ve poin ts, up 56-51, bu t four-
straight points by McGann cut the 
lead to one, despite the fact that 
Johnson fouled out during this 
stretch. 

Sonoma State began to pull 
away at 59-5 5, and two missed free 
throws and a blocked three point 
attempt ensured the victory. They 
added a nother free-throw in the 
final seconds to win 60-55. 

Johnson'S 13 points led all 
Tri ton scorers, and she had seven 
rebounds. Bolton-Gallagher 
grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds 
in addition to her five points. 0 
li'non other than Johnson broke

double digits in scoring, but 
UCSD had well-balanced scoring. 
Ten of the II players gerting min-
utes in the game scored at least one 
point, while four scored at least 
five points. 

Junior Tara Whiteside led all 
Sonoma State scorers with 15 
points and added four rebounds 
and four steals. Forward Shannon 
Taylor and guard Lacey Campbell 
both had 11 points and 5 rebounds 
for Sonoma State. 

The Tritons returned to action 
immediately as they faced San 
Francisco State on Jan. 31, but 
results of that game were not avail-
able at press time. UCSD will now 
be heading out on the road to face 
San Francisco State on Feb. 6 and 
Sonoma State on Feb. 7.

VolleybaH: No. 15 Tritons fall to 4 .. 4 overall 
concinued from page 16 

open the first game, but could not 
hold on as a potent Warrior attack 
rallied to take a 3 0-2 1 victory. 

Game two was tight through-
out, and UCSD managed to stay 

~ithin four points for the entire 
game. The Tritons rallied to tie 
things up at 29 apiece, but were 
denied a chance to even the 
match as the Warriors grabbed 
two points to take the H-29 win. 

Although Hawaii controlled 
the match, the Tritons refused to 
quit fighting and it was only on 
the strength on an incredible 
Warrior blocking effort that 
UCSD was denied the win in 
game three. The Tritons put down 
an incredible 19 kills in the third 
game, but hit only .175 for the 
game because of 9.5 team blocks 
by the Warriors. The third game's 
blocking effort pushed Hawaii's 
block total to 14.5, while UCSD 
had only six blocks for the match. 
On the strength of that blocking, 
the Warriors escaped with a 32-30 
win and the sweep. 

UCSD falls to 4-4 overall and 
2-3 in the MPSF with back-to-
back losses_ The Tritons return to 
action on Feb. 6 and Feb. 7 with 
road matches in Pennsylvania 
against No. 11 Penn State and 
No. 14 Lewis University, respec-
tively. 

Penn State's 4-4 record is cur-
rently tied with UCSD while 
Lewis is 3 -6.

Volleyball 
suffers 

back-to-
back losses 

Tritons 
drop both 
matches 'to 

Hawaii 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Senior Staff Writer 

"Aloha" Jlso means goodbye, 
as the o. 15 UCSD men's volley-
ball team learned after a quick 
Hawaii trip in which it dropped 
two matches to the No. 4 
University of Hawaii Warriors. 

In front of a crowd of 4,412 on 
Jan. 28, the Tritons ran into a 
Hawaii team that had more offen-
sive weapons than UCSD could 
handle. The Tritons were able to 
trade points with the Warriors early 
in game one, but Hawaii's .444 rut-
ting percentage proved to be too 
much as the game wore on and the 
Warriors grabbed an early lead and 
a 30-25 victory. 

Hawaii dominated game two, 
leading by as many as rune points 
and was able to grab the victory by 
eight, 30-22. 

UCSD showed a renewed 
sense of resolve in game three and 
grabbed its first lead of the night 
mid-game. The lead, however, 
would not last long as the 
Warriors appeared eager to close 
out the match. Warrior senior Arri 
Jeschke served five consecutive 
points to give Hawaii the cusmon 
it needed to close out the match, 
30-25. 

The usually balanced Triton 
offense heavily focused on senior 
opposite Jim Waller in the match, 
as Waller picked up 19 of UCSD's 
44 kjlls. No other player account-
ing for more than eight kills. The 
Tritons attacked at a solid .321 
clip, but the Warriors put up a very 
impressive .409, with 49 kills and 
only 11 errors on 93 attempts. 

Given the travel difficulties 
associated with playing Hawaii, 
teams in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation alternate years 
playing two matches in Hawaii or 
two at home instead of a home-
and-home series each season. After 
a night off, the Tritons and the 
Warriors prepared to play once 
again on Jan. 30. 

The balance returned to 
UCSD's attack in the second 
match-up with the Warriors, but 
unfortunately the win did not. 
Junior outside hitter Adam Toren 
and reigning MPSF Player of the 
Week senior middle hitter Kevin 
Keyser each tallied nine kills with 
Waller and sophomore outside 
hitter Jeff Urton adding eight 
each, but it wasn't enough to over-
come Hawaii's strong offense. 
. The Tritons had a 3-0 run to

Season-high 1,992 fans 'crowd RIMAe on Spirit Night 

By MAn RYAN 
Senior staff writer 

On the Jan. 30 Spirit Night, 
the Triton men's basketball 
team continued to struggle as it 
returned home to a season-rugh 
crowd of 1,992 people with a 
loss to Sonoma State, 74-65. 
The loss for UCSD now gives 
the Tritons six consecutive loss-
es. 

The Tritons came out flat 
and were down early. The 
Seawolves surged with a score 
of 29-13 with 9:55 left in the 
half. Triton junior forward 
Brandon Francis kept the game 
close at the end of the half with 
a couple of three-pointers, leav-
ing UCSD to trail Sonoma 
State by only eight at the half, 
44-36. 

The Tritons came out 

inspired to start the second half 
and trimmed the lead to 51-50 
on a tip by sophomore forward 
Matthew Conti. Sonoma State 
then dug in and the Tritons 
were unable to complete the 
comeback. Sonoma State went 
up rune points late in the con-
test by going seven of 1 0 from 
the foul line. 

Tills victory by Sonoma State 
snapped a four-game skid and 
was led by freshman forward 
James TIpton, who finished with 
game highs of 18 points and 12 
rebounds, while front court mate 
seruor forward Lamar Abbott 
added 17 points and seven 
boards. Sonoma State ' junior 
guard Ryan Hensel and fresh-
man Jeff Fuller also reached dou-
ble figures with 16 and II points,
