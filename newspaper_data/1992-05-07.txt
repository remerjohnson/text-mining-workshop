In moves that will invalidate two Associated Stu-
dent ballot referenda and further delay the result of 
the A .S. presidential run-off election, the A.S. Judicial 
Board found Elections Manager Jennifer Flaim guilty 
of two counts of election mismanagement. 

11te board ruled unanimously in the case of Durall 
v. Flaim that Aaim did not inform presidential candi-
date Ruben Duran of the deadline to file a complaint, 
thereby denying him due process under the A .S. by-
laws. 

As a result of that decision. presidential election 
run-off results will not be released for at least another 
week until the Election Review Committee can rule on 
the charge filed by Durnn again t his opponent, Mike 
Holme . 

" It 's a decision I expected. It was based on a 
technicality. [Durnn) and I haddifferent interpretations 
of the bylaws," Aaim aid.

There was a changing of the guard at the University 
Center Board (UCB) during Monday night' meeting, 
as former Commi ioner of Finance/Enterprise and 
Co-op Chri Burnett was elected to replace Molly 
McKay as UCB Chair. 

Despite the change, the board seems likely to 
maintain its focus on seeking autonomy from the 
university into the next academic year. 

If the propo ed new UCB charter is approved. next 
year's UCB chair election will go to an all-student vote. 

Burnett has been one of the most prominent voices 
on the board over the past year, often pressing for even 
stronger actions toward his stated goal of "student

Children and staff were evacuated from the 
Early Childhood Education Center at the Mesa 
Apartment Complex on Tuesday afternoon as a 
precautionary measure when the center received 
a bomb threat. 

According to Josie Fou Iks. the center's direc-
tor. the call was received between I :30 and 2 
p.m. The caller. who was male, hung up imme-
diately after making a two-word threat. 

Foulks de cribed the evacuation of the chil-
dren and staff as an appropriate precaut ion which 
the staff decided to take. 

"We have a fire and an earthquake drill once 
a month, so the children knew exactly what to 
do." Foulks said. 

"I founded the center 22 years ago. and thi 
has never happened before," he added. 

The UCSDpolicewere informed of the bomb 
threat at 2:30. Police were uncertain of the mo-
tive behind the bomb threat.

HIV Home Test Taken Off Market; 
Time, Sample Size May Cause Mistakes 
By Karen Cheng 
Guardian Reporter 

A company marketing an Hrv 
antibody "home check." an ad for 
which appeared in the Gllardial/ 
last month, ha~ been ordered by 
tate officials from the Food and 

Drug branch of the Depanmenl of 
Health Services to stop marketing 
its product. 

Repre entalives of Ihe Co ta 
Mesa-based Health Test, Inc. said 
recently that ils HIV home Ie t has 
been FDA-approved ince I 988. and 
denied that the promotion of their 
product was halted by Ihe state. 

However. Jim Barquest of the 
Deptlrtment of Health Services said 
that Ihe depanment met wilh repre-
sentatives of Heallh Test, Inc. on 
April 27 and, "as of Inow), Ihey 

houldn 'l be se lling it." 
"For all intents and purposes. we 

did hall the markeling of their prod-
uct." Barqest said. 

The problem with the home test 
centers on it accuracy. The $24.95 
kit is mailed to the user's home. 
where he or she pricks a finger and 
collects a small sample of blood. 
The blood is spread on a piece of 
fi ller paper and senl ba k to the 
company. Health Test, Inc. Ihen 
sends Ihe sample 10 a state-cenified 
laboratory for scientific analysis. 

Negative test results are deliv-
ered by mail in a week to 10 days. 
along with a wnllet-sized card giv-
ing the dllte of the test. I f the result 
was HlV -posi ti ve. then a counselor 
contacls the person explaining Ihat 
the test was "inconclusive:' The 

individual would then be directed 10 
a physician or clinic 10 oblain a 
more specific and confirmatory tesl. 

State official claim that these 
kinds of home tests lead to inaccu-
rate results. due to factors such a~ 
how long the kit or blood sample sits 
inamailbox, what temperJtures il i~ 
exposed to and what volumeofblood 
is tested. These factors can greatly 
alter the te ting proce~s . 

According to Barquest, unycom-
pany that considers markeling a 
health product or test must submil 
information to the stale of Califor-
nia showing that the produci is SlIfe 
and effective. and proving Ihat the 
company is aware of ~ttlle health 
requirements.

Riots Hit Home for UCSD Student From South-Central Los Angeles 
By Miguel Buckenmeyer

You'd think that if a neighbor-
hood was under siege the residents 
would be scared to death. You would 
also think that a college student 
whose family still resides in Ihat 
neighborhood would fear for their 
lives. 

Think again. 
"Elizabeth:' a UCSD student 

who grew up in South-Central Los 
Angeles, was very frank about her 
feelings concerning the magnitude 
of violence that had erupted to the 
magnitude that ithad nearherllome.

said that she called home to speak to 
her family, but not out of fear. When 
asked if he was at all frightened for

I wasn't scared."

refr.lin from taking precautions. 
Gang warfare abounds in Soulh-
Central Los Angele and her own 
street has been marked off as terri-
tory be longing to a gang cal led the 
"41 sts." 

The threat of violence also ex-
tends to those families nOI directly 
related to gangs. Guns are owned by 
more than just gang members . 
Nearly every household has one. 

"You need to have a gun. You 
can ' t live in South-Central L.A. and 
not have agun." Elizabeth remarked. 

She has her own stories 10 tell of 
witnessing past violent episodes that 

have caused her 10 be "immune" to 
what happened lasl week. 

" My brother and hi\ friend were 
stmnded by Crenshaw and Jefferson 
and so they called their friend up. 
The guy picked themup.lllis [otherl 
guy drove by and . hot bullels at Ihe 
car where my brother was and then 
shot the guy who picked up my 
brother in Ihe head. The nexi day 
they took the life support syslem 
off." 

Elizabeth offered further proof 
that violence, for most, is just a way 
of life in South-Central L.A. 

"I called my mom up and said. 

'How is everylhing?' 'Oh nOlhing 
much has happened around Ihe 

hou~e.' ~he said . . People have been 
looting and burning down Ihe li-
quor store.' I'm quoling her: · It 's 
pretty calm down here. nOlhing 
much has happened.''' 

Her mother' s biggest fear. she 
said. was thal the family was oul of 
tortillas and milk because Ihe local 
liquor slores and delis hud burned 
down. Even if the family's relatives

RODERICK LEE 
King Verdict Isn't 
1he Only Travesty

The fire are out now, and 
the rage that swept through Los 
Angeles and other cities a ross 
the nation has hopefully 

ub ided. Now comes the arduous ta~k of renewal and 
rccoru.truction. 

As a conservative in a pol>t-King verdict world, I am 
used to being in the perceived minority. The liberal 
DemocrJts have blamed Ronald Reagan on everything 
from our current economic woes and poor race relations to 
the "Tomahawk Chop" and the worst season stan in the 
Kansas City Royals' history. And I am surely not going to 
win any points by trying to defend pan of the jury's 
verdict. 

As a Southern California native, I witnessed the King 
video almost immediately after KTLA first secured the 
rights for its broadcast. Like most people. my initial 
reaction was shock and revulsion. Being no Daryl Gates 
fan myself, this was clearly an open-and-shut case against 
the LAPD. 

But now, over a year later, comes the trial, moved by 
order of an appellate coun at the request of the defense to 
just across the LA. County line to the largely affluent 
community of Simi Valley in Ventura County. 

Still inclined to side completely with King , I watched 
what the media had dubbed "the defense 's manipulalion (my

MAlT ROBINSON 
Mob Mentally Does 
Not Aclieve Anything 

I get very nervous in the 
presence of the masses. And, 
given enough time. I think that 
I would uffocate from the self-
rightcousnes and general 
euphoria that accompanies 
giving one's mind over to 
group-think. It really doesn't 
matter to me what the group is 

saying. because the disposition of group rJllies are the 
same. Speakers voices rise in crescendos of anger and lull 
with encomium to freedom, justice or peace. But the 
re ull is the same: people are whipped into a frenzy and 
hypnotized by chants and songs. Then they are immune to 
mtionality and simple arguments so that reason is the only 
thing not in the crowd. 

Anytime one is noating in the direction of everybody 
else to maintain a point. doom is imminent. I don't buy 
any f the arguments about the "healthy venting of anger" 
nor the "emotionally-charged environment" that makes 
change inevitable. 

What happened at these mllies proved that the peren-
nial protester and group-thinker ignores subtle thought. 
Like the temperamental toddler, tantrums are a means of 
manipulation but should never be considered deep 
thought. Student who are continually looking for a mean~

and in the en uing verdict an indictment of a ":.y tern" to

We all saw some great, impassioned speeche 
by African-Americans last week. The AASU

of a television image of the chancellor meet-

immeasurable. 

TIle choice is given to the student : meet 
Atkinson on campus, or refuse and hope he 
comes to us. It seemed to me that sentiment 
favored waiting. But then a few students got 
up. and uddenly we were all being ushered 
off the road. We had him in the palm of our 

hand, and we let him lip away. 
We march back to cam-

TIlen there was Saturday's 
Plalica. A Plalica is a conver-
sation, or a round-Iftble dis-
cussion, centering around one 
issue. Organized by the cam-
pusnewspaperVo:Frollferi:a. 
this Plalica focused on the 
Chicano tudent empower-
ment movement. Participants 
included noted historian Rudy 
Acuha. author of Occllpied 
America; feminist activist 
Adelaide del Castillo; militant 
Brown Beret David Rico; and 
Sylvia Bustamante of the As-
sociation of Chicana Activ-
ists.

we're all si tting on the con-

federal system, they

He gives in to none of our 
demands. then finally recants 
and agree to lower the nags 
to half mast in memory of the 
people who have died in L.A. 
He also reads us a letter he has 
wrinen (0 Pre. ident Bush. In 
it, he asks that the President 
begin an ofticial Justice De-
partment investigation into the 
violationofKing'scivil rights. 

Chancelor isn't 
enough; they want 

the President. 
Although the day' focu 

was the Chicano movement, 
the King trial verdict was at the heart of the 
discus ion. One part of a disenfranchised 
group cannot talk about empowerment with-
out considering the re t of the disenfranchised 
group. Indeed. the participants stressed, over 
and over again. two main themes of the em-
powerment movement at large: organization 
and discipline. One striking thing about the 
prote ters was just how organized they were, 
and how disciplined. In one sense, the rallies 
provided the spirit and the feeling of the 
movement. and thePlalk'a provided the intel-
lectual concepts. Both aspects are necessary 
for a struggle to be successful. and can only be 
achieved by all those involved working to-
gether. So we have the heart of a movement, 
and the ideas of a movement. 

Where do we go from here? 
We go to 1-5, where 500 students are 

sitting in the afternoon sun, waiting for the 
police to arrest them or Chancellor Atkinson 
to show up, whichever comes first. They have 
a list of demands. the first of which is that our 
chancellor, the man who is responsible for 
and to us, come and meet his students. 

(The students' solidarity in this action is 
evident in their chant~. Recognizing that the 
UC is only pan of the larger unjust federal 
system, they decide that the chancellor isn't 
enough; they want the President. Women and 
men begin chanting, "We want Dick! We 
want Bush!" How egalitarian can you get?) 

At first the chancellor is unreachable. Then 
he is "unavailable." A little while later he 
becomes available to meet with his tudents, 
but only on his terms - not on the " free"way, 
but back on campus. 

This is a critical moment. The students 
have come very close. My feeling was that if 
we held out ju t a little longer, Atkinson 
would have to come to us. The publicity value 

While this is admimble of 
the Chancellor, it mu t be remembered that 
the Just ice Department had already announced 
this inve. tigation two days earlier. 

For the finishing touche, Student Con-
duct Coordinator Nick Aguilar succeeds 
Atkinson atthe mike. He tells us how proud he 
is of the restrai nt we' ve shown. Then he closes 
by saying, "You did very well today. 1llere's 
a TG going on; let 's pany!" 

Someone should have told him the only 
one panying last Friday were those four cops 
in Simi Valley. 

It is important that we not reduce these 
issues to individuals. Ye • four cop did beat 
Rodney King and get away with it. but the 
fault lies with the sy tern. And yes, Dick 
Atkinson does have lots of real power here at 
UCSD, but it is the structure of the university 
that needs to be examined. 

This does not absolve the individuals in-
volved of responsibility. Although he mu t 
work within constraints, there are things the 
Chancellor can do to make this campus more 
just. The student ' demands, from a Chicano 
Studies Department to an African-American 
Studies Departmenttoa fully funded Women's 
Center. are all anempts to make this campus 
a fairer and more representative place for 
people to live and work. While he can't do it 
alone, the chancellor can go a long way in 
making this a reality - if he wants to. 

What can students working together do to 
rectify an unjust system? To use the words of 
Buckminster Fuller, we can "think globally, 
act locally."Our university is part of the larger 
system. The causes of injustice go beyond 
individuals' actions, but working collecti vely 
we can find the solutions. This begins right 
here. By making our university more just, we 
make our world more just. That's what this 
movement is all about.

empha~is)" of the King video. Tomy surprise 
and initial di may, I found myself taking 
stock in some of the defense' arguments. 
And after witnessing bits and pieces of the 
trial, for both the prosecution and defense. I 
find myself siding with part of a deci ion that 
set the nation ablaze in the worst civil insur-
rection since 1861. 

But which pans? Having only witnessed 
ponions of the trial. I feel I can only truthfully 
comment on two of the decisions. Officer 
Briseno, who is seen trying to restrain the 
other three officers. and made contact with 
Kingonly once, was rightfully acquitted. One 
kick should not make for any kind of brutality 
charge that hould stick, even if it was afterthe 
first five blows conceded by the prosecution. 

On the other hand. Officer Powell'!. ac-
quitt'll on all but one count is completely off 

ba~e. The officer in charge. Powell adminis-
tered over thirty of the 58 blows ~een on the 
tape. There is no way anyone should be com-
fonable with this decision. And forthe record. 
I would probably lind the other two guilty as 
well. 

So, that's one hit and three misses. On the 
whole, I am still on the anti-verdict side. But. 
people should realize that there are more than 
just the twelvejurors and the officers and their 
fanlilies who support all of the verdict. An I 
they are not all racist bigots. 

To those protesters out there. the question 
is posed: Were you initially 
inclined to ~ide against the 

Rodney King to pay for the cost of his and the 
officers ' trial? Operation Rescue was sen-
tenced to pay all coun processing fees as well 
as the police resources used to arrest them. 

Some have said thutthe officers' actions 
were racist. Granted, the Christopher Com-
mission has released a repon finding raci~t 
elements throughout the LAPD. But is it not 
also rJcist to pull innocent whites from their 
vehicles, beat them. and leave them for dead? 
No. say the self-anointed "oppressed:' In 
their minds. there is no such thing asdiscrimi-
nation against whites because blacks have 
tx.'Cn "oppressed" by the "white establish-
ment" for all these decades. 

Then. what about the targeting of Kore-
ans? Four out often businesses in Koreatown 
were torched. looted. or both. True. tensions 
between blacks and Koreans have been high 
~ince a Korean store owner was given no jail 
time for the fatal shooting ofa black teenager. 
But does thai justify the torching of Chine~e 
re ·taurants? In many ~trip malls in the heanof 
L.A. , Chine,e re~taurJnts were torched while 
the other businesses were left completely 
intact. 

The verdict has been called a "travesty." 
The realtrJvesty wa~ theprosecution'sacqui-
escence in allowing the trial to be moved in 
the first place. And to compound matters, the 
prosecution failed to place a black on the jury. 
The office~ were entitled to a jury f peers. 
but the "racist, all-white" jury included an 
Asian and a Hispanic. King did not lo~e to 
racism, but to a suburban community where 

the police are not viewed as 
"the enemy" and crime is an 

LAPD? In either ca<;e, did you 
watch any of the trial? Ifso,did 
you watch it with an open mind? 
Before you start whooping up 
a storm about the verdict and 
America being "inherently rac-
ist," ask yourself. would you 
have made an impanial juror? 

King did not lose to 
racism, but to a 

suburban 

important issue. If the offic-
ers did not stand a fair trial in 
L.A .. the appellate court 
would have done King jus-
tice by moving the trial to 
another big urban city. per-
haps San Diego. Santa Ana, 
or even San Fr.lOcisco. 

While the initial prote. t on 
Thursday was justified and 
largely focused, the closure of 
1-5 on Friday was a gross abuse 
of the po t-verdict rage. It is a 

community where 
the police are not 

viewed as ''the The so-called leaders of

government of doing noth-

well-known fact that everyone 
on this campus who opposes the verdict. 
whether panially or in full, also supports a 
fully funded Women 's Resource Center, and 
"Gay, Women's. African-American. and 
Chicano Studies Departments." If you really 
believe that. you can also believe that Mario 
Cuomo announced this morning that he will 
challenge President Bush for the GOP nomi-
nation. 

The American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU) blames this whole mess on LAPD 
Chief Daryl Gates and has called for his 
resignation. Is it not also brutality to grind the 
faces of non-violent protesters into the rain-
soaked asphalt of Wilshire Boulevard? Where 
was the ACLU in June 1990 when the LAPD 
first innicted nunchakus on Operation Res-
cue? Where was the media uproar when per-
manent neurological damage was inflicted on 
a woman for refusing to walk? Did ajudge a~k 

ing, but they have helped to 
block someofthe most ambi-

tious experiments of urban renewal. Secre-
tary of Housing and Urban Development 
Jack Kemp's move to establish economic 
enterprise zones have been blocked by the 
Democrats because the zones are pro-busi-
ness. Well. of course they are! Establi~hing 
new busines is an essential step in economic 
revitalization. Now who's "heartless?" 

Over $700 million in damage was caused 
by the violence. An even greatertravesty will 
be the upcoming statewide tax that will affect 
innocent members of far-nung communitiel> 
in Alpine and Del None Countie~ as equally 
as it does L.A. County. 

Finally, what's going to happen if the 
Justice Depanment finds that King's civil 
rights were not violated? More violence? nle 
protesters would do well to remember the 
non-violence preached by another man named 
King.

televi ion media seems to have con-
tributed greatly to this perspective 
by obscuring the di fference bet ween 
the violent acts of the few with those 
of the majority, the impoveri hed 
people who looted stores ell masse. 

It 's a very nice milk and cookies 
analysis to say that looting i a crime 
and all those engaged in it are crimi-
nals. Such a view would imply a 
generic "mora\"' fonilUde common

This view is very common in those 
that believe multiculturalism can-
not contribute to a bener education

As a result, Flaim had to accept 
Dur.in·s complaint against Holmes

mittee held a Board of Inquiry to 
hear the charge. If Holme is ac-
quitted. then the presidential ballots 
will be opened and tabulated. 

In the case of Wilcox 1'. Flaim. 
the board ruled 3.2 that Flaim had 
erred in allowing the order of two 
<UTlendments on the official election 
ballot to be switched from how they 
appeared on the sample ballot. The 
case, brought by A.S_ Chair of Op-

Paul Wilcox. will invalidate the re-
ults of referenda on the election of 

A.S. senators and on the status of the 
student advocate position. 

In a third ruling, the board found 
that Flaim was not guilty of harass-
ing Duran into not filing a violation 
report against Holmes on the 
grounds of insufficient evidence. 

The charge - brought against

said A.S. Adviser Randy Woodard. 
"On the technicality ruling. I'm not 
surprised. In my impression though. 
[Durnn) k.new he was going to file 
and he knew when the deadline was." 

Woodard and Flaim both said 
that the A.S. bylaws are in need of 
clari fication and revision. 

In the Wilcox I '. Flaim case, ac-
cording to Judicial Board member 
Michele Bnlger, the fact that Flaim 
did not catch the ballot mistake is 
the reason she was found guilty of 
mismanagement. 

Board member D.A. Banolotta. 
who disagreed with the majority on 
the case, contended that election 
bylaws do not state that items have 

of other committees ~uch as a Pub 
committee to oversee the renova-
tion of the Triton Pub and a Fmter-
nity/Sorority outreach committee. 

Burnett's most imponant con-
celll, however, is that of UCB au-
tonomy . In his application essay , he 
delineated that interest. 

uThi year' sevents have demon-
stnlted a need forthe UCB to clarify 
financial relationships between the 
UCSD student body and the re-
gents. This is by farthe most impor-
tant issue the UCB will be facing." 
he wrote. 

The 5-3 vote came after an hour 
of debate overt he two applicants for 
the position. Bumett and Vice Chair 
Erik Swanholt, the board's Warren 
College representative. 

Swanholt also said that the most 
imponant issue facing the board in 
the coming year would be student 
control over fee-funded facilities. 

Chung acknowledged, though. 
that pro-life students are a "very 
small minority" on campus. 

Pro-choice speakers warned that 
pro-life politicians have allegedly 
infi lt l"'d.ted many political offices. 
panicularly in San Diego. in spite of 
surveys that show the majority of 
San Diegans are pro-choice. 

"We have anti-choice candidates 
running for office in every ingle 
county; ' said Heidi Minsch from 
the San Diego Planned Parenthood 
Action Fund. 

Pro-cho ice activist Midge 
Costanza listed the names of several 
San Diego legislators and politi-
cians who she said were anti-choice. 
"We are shining a light on these 
cockroaches so they ' ll neverbe able 
to fool us again." Costanza said. 

One speaker related hertraumatic 

The only member of the family 
who was afraid was Elizabeth 's 
youngest brother. Although he is 
only I 0, he has become immune to 
the everyday gang violence_ But the 
riots were another matter. 

"He was pretty scared, as op-
posed to my mom and dad ... . He 
was saying 'Elizabeth, can I come 
with you?' He was just scared be-
cause his surroundings were bum-
ing like hell around him and people 
were 'maniacs'!" 

Despite the family'sandherown 
ability to cope with the situation, 
Elizabeth said she wants to get out 
of that environment.

tobe in thesameorderon the sample 
ballot and the official 1><11101. 

In the complaint heard by the 
Election Review Committee this 
morning as a result of the Durall I ' . 
Flaim ruling. Holmes faced charges 
that he did not account for a ponion 
of his election materiaL During the 
testimony before theJudici:J1 Board 
n the case of Durall \'. Flaim. Dudn 

said that he had a witness m Kinko's 
Copies who could testify that 
Holmes did not account for some 
campaign fliers he had printed there. 

Durdn has also charges Holmes 
with falsifying campaign records 
and neglecting to purchase cam-
paign material at a fair market price. 
When asked to talk about thecharges 
against Holmes, Duran had no com-
ment. 

Holmes aid he is glad the hear-
ing will be held so he can clear hi s 
name. 

"The hearing will draw out the 
announcement of the election re-
sults. but I'll finally be able to tell 
my ide of the story:' he said. 

If Holme is found gUilty. the 
Election Review Committee will 
decide if Holmes will be removed 
from the ballot. 

However , unlike Burnett . 
Swanholt said he felt that a good 
working relmion&hip wilh the ad-
ministration was imperative. Dur-
ing the debate he told the board that. 
.. Jt·sobvious that the administration 
is going to playa big role in the 
future of this board . _ .. it" sa fact anti 
we'regoing to have to deal with it: ' 

Yesterday Bumett commented 
that while Swanholt was definitely 
qualified forthepositionofchair. he 
wasn't sure of Swanholt"s convic-
tions. "He has the experience, l but I 
at the same time I question hi s com-
mitment to financial autonomy,'-
Burnett said. 

Graduate Student Association 
President and UCB representative 
Denise Fenton was opposed to 
Bumett 's becoming chair. "I'm sad-
dened that the board is willing to put 
the interests of students through 
this:' she said yesterday. 

experience of being unable to get a 
legal abonion as a young woman, 
and being forced to perfonll the 
procedure on herself. "We can't al-
low things to go back to the way 
they were;' she said. 

After the scheduled speakers 
were finished. the microphone was 
opened to anyone who wished to 
express his or her own views on the 
subject. Several women, choked 
wi th emotion, stepped up to the 
microphone, described their ex peri-
ences of being raped and demanded 
control over their own bodies. 

One student said she had an abor-
tion and was harassed by Operd.tion 
Rescue activists in front of a clinic 
when she retumed for a check-up. 

Recall ing what she described as 
hate-fi lied looks directed at her, she

"That's why I study," she said, 
thanking her mom for pushing her 
to pursue her education. 

"I want to help people and be in 
legal services because before I would 
see police officers that work in the 
narcotics division come to my neigh-
borhood and beat people just for 
anything. Even before the Rodney 
King incident, I aw people get 
thrown onto the cement and the 
[police) would stan beating the poor 
men. Once they threw a man so hard 
they broke his tooth. You never 
really think about it. You grow into 
thi :.y. tem that you really never 
question," Elizabeth said.

Los Angeles. its destruction, war 
and chaos, begs for a legitimate 
critique of what happened and this 
is even more vital for the serious 
university s tudent who wishes to 
improve the world. 

Simply said , the outbreak of vio-
lence in L.A. on April 30 was proD-
ably the most importam (i nfamous1 
tragic?)evem in recent U.S. history. 
For democracy worldwide, it repre-
senlsahonificpos ibleworldwhere 
the mechanisms oflaw and democ-
racy are flouted. And for civiliza-
tion, it is an argument for Hobbes' 
phrase about life in the state of na-
ture that is "solitary, poor, nasty, 
brutish. and s hort." 

Beyond the empty gong banging 
of the self-proclaimed experts on 
American law, serious understand-
ings of what has tmnspired in L.A. 
are available. 

Dr. Sanford l..akoff, a UCSO 
political scienceprofessorwhostud-
ies American political thought, says 
that "the problem is that the afflu-
ence and education that brings sta-
bility to a democracy has been 
eroded in the inner city." 

"When you have a serious 
underclas you can expect them to 
act like members of the Third 
World," he adds. They have "no 
great stake in r government) and will 
bum it down." 

Likewise, UCSO's Dr. Steven 
Erie, whose pecialty is urban and 
ethnic politics, ascribed the causes 
not so much to racial problems but 
to class-warfare. "The phenomena 
you witnessed is much more the 
' Blade Runner' society," 

Erie was present the day after the 
Watts RiolS in 1965, and it was DOl 
the same as Los Angeles, 1992. 
"Watts was more politicaL" And 
19921 It was a "consumer shopping 
pree." 

The riots were multi-ethnic and 
the war against businesses do not 
point to something so simple as 
"race-wrufare. " Erie believes. rather. 
that it was the reactions of the "have-
nots" against the " haves." Hence, 
the attacks against the Korean-
Americans were not racial. but an 
attack on the middle-man. 

Obviouslythesearenotthe subtle 
ideas that were heard at the rallies. 
And the fact that the problems of the 
inner city remain afterthe protesters 
go home is something that is more 
sign ificant. Mass demonstrations are 
immensely powerful things and 
never fail to identify evils, but they 
have the bad habit of missing the 
solutions to problems. 

You see. you can't keep people 
whipped in a frenzy if serious think-
ing goes. You'll lose your momen-
tum. They condemn, rail against, let 
off team about, rebuke, reprove, 
declaim and forbid bad weatherdays, 
but do nothing to prepare for the 
future. And it is well . known that 
anyone can find evil in the world but 
it is how to solve it and where to go 
that requires leaders, not pseudo-
anarchists. 

"Therefore, one is not surprised 
by the further critique offered by 
Lakoffwhen he says, "Symbol poli-
tics of this sort don't impress." The 
students missed the opportunity to 
propose ideas that had real muscle. 

And Dr. Erie, who is a virtual 
fount of ideas on the inner city, 
expressed a similar feeling when he 
said, "The protests were a self-in-
dulgent, foolish thing. They made 
students feel self-righteous but it 
was not very constructive. And I say 
that as a liberal."

HIV 
ContInued from page 3 
home tests have been appro t:d for 
marketing., .. Health Test Inc . had a 
problem. for there was no way to 
as ure the integrity of the blood 
sample. and no nurse was going to 
provide appropriate and neces~ary 
counseling:' he said, 

Chris Oakley. who is the HIV/ 
AIDS counselor and manager of 
Patient Services at the UCSD Stu-
dent Health Service. says that her 
main concerns about HIV te ts are 
accuracy and confidentiality . . 

"Sludents are going to be at-
tracted to home te t . Knowing that 
students use horne pregnancy tests. 
it's something that you wanttodo in 
the privacy of your own home. and 
it makes sense:' she said. 

"TIle home test is so attmctive. 
basic.'lIly because iI's simple. ea~y 
and can be done in privacy. The 
problem is that if a negative result 
comes up. tSlUdents] are not going 
to want to explore it any further. 
111<1t'5 what they want to believe ... 
and that 's where it's going to end." 
she said. 

Whal studenls do not know. she 
said. is that it does not end there. 

Whether the result is positive or 
negative. people who are tested for 
HIV need post-test one-on-one 
coun~eling. she said. The home test 
doe~ not claim to offer this sort of 
conlidentiality. 

"If the test results are inaccu-
rately negative. the person will be 
under the false assumption that they 
are negati ve. continue to spread the 
virus and not take proper care of 
themselves. 

Positive te t results might lead to 
alienation and fear. In such a sensi-
tive siluation. a trained counselor is 
able to explain the process and an-
swer any questions about HlV. 

Between the time of blood with-
dmwal and actual results is a lime of 
fear and anxiety, and professional 
coun eling sets up a support sys-
tem:' Oakley said. 

RALLY 
Continued from page 7 
said. "It is not a pro-life movement. 
It is an ami-choice. ami-woman 
movement." 

"Goddamn it. who else but me 
should decide?" she added. 

Many speakers made references 
to the smaJl group of pro-life dem-
onstmtors at the side of the rally, and 
at one point invited them to express 
their opinion to the crowd. 

Three of the pro-life demonstm-
tors subsequently spoke 10 the 
crowd. claiming that the pro-life 
position had been misrepresented 
by some of the mlly' s speakers. 

One pro-I i fe female student said. 
"We believe Ihe child wilhin the 
woman is a human ~ing:' The 
crowd was mostly silent during the 
pro-life comments, with occasional 
shouts of disagreement. Others in 
the audience houled. "Let them 
speak!" 

Chung said there is no pro-life 
movement on campus. since a pre-
vious group disintegrated due to 
lack of interest. 

"We are very interested in slart-
ing a group." she said. 

Costanza. who i also an orga-
nizer for U.S. Representative Bar-
bara Boxer's campaign for the U.S. 
Senate. remarked that she felt the 
rally was a success. 

"I measure by energy and not by 
bodies. and this rally was very ener· 
getic:' Co tanza said.

inning. 

Hansen's 10th win ties him for first place in the 
single-sea on record book. while his 78 strikeouts put 
him in fourth place, Though Hansen ha~ WOol a Triton 
unifonn for only two years. the senior a e is currently 
third in career strikeouts ( 137) and second in career 
ERA (2.62). 

Offensively. Emie Isola led the batsmen with two 
doubles and a solo home run in four at-bats. Isola 
finished up his final regular season with three home 
runs and a team-leading .426 balling average. 

Isola complemented his perfonnance at the plate 
with a pair of outstanding gmbs in center field . In the 
founh inning. he made a sliding shoestring catch and 
then bettered himself one inning later by making an 
over-the-shoulder snare with his back to home plate, 
robbing a Coyote clubber of extm bases.

Open tournament 
By Ken Perlman 
Sports Editor 

While the fear of violence 
kept many away from the Los 
Angeles and San Francisco ar-
eas last weekend, the UCSD 
women's water polo team lrav-
eled to Berkeley to do battle at 
the "CaI-Open"Toumamentand 
finished with a satisfying 3-2 
record. 

On Friday, the Tritons were 
scheduled to lock horns with Ihe 
nation's top-ranked team, and 

their arch-rival , UC Davis. But 
because of fears of violence. the 
Aggies did not show up until 
Saturday morning and UCSD 
took the game by forfeit. 

The Tritons opened up a 
rough Saturday with a 13-6 win 
overanexrremelyphysical squad 
from Calgary. Canada. 

"All teams from Canada are 
notoriously physical," said 
UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper, whose team made ef-
fective use of its countenutack 
to shut down its opponents. 

With the victory, the Tritons 
won their bracket and earned a

Ergathon a Success for Crew 
• UCSD earns $3000 for 
trip to Championships 
By Theresa Moore 
Staff Writer 

I n its first annual ergathon lasl 
Friday at the Price Center, the UCSD 
men's crew team mised approxi-
mately$3000while meeting its goal 
of rowing one million meters . 

Chair of the event and second-
year coxswain Kimberly Johnson 
emphasized the financial success of 
the event which Ihe team has desig-
nated as its annual fundraiser. 

Collecting fortheofficial amount 
earned will begin late this week, but 
Johnson says that the team was able 
to collect over $100 from walk-by 
donations alone. The money will go 
toward partially paying for the 

team's night to the Pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships later this 
month at Lake Natoma and the re-
mainder will go toward purchasing 
a new set of oars. 

According to Johnson. the team 
did not break the Guiness World 
Record held by Dartmouth, which 
achieved the mark on one erg. a 
rowing machine, as opposed to 
UCSD's eight. 

Apparently, the event was not 
affected by the activity on campus 
concerning the verdict ofthe Rodney 
King trial and the violence in Los 
Angeles. 

Johnson did admit Ihough, that 
"thing got a little ten e." Otherlhan 
that, Ihe event went smoolhly and 
proved to be a financial success for 
the team.

W. POLO 
ContInued from pace 11 
game against Sunset, UCSO'sclub 
team. Harper decided to give both 
teams a rest and the Tritons for-
feited the game. 

Sunday morning , UCSD 
matched up again t the San Diego 
State club team. In the last meeting 
between the two this seao;on, the 
Aztec were hoping to steal at least 
one game. But the cross-town rival 
Tritons fini hed the season with a 

perfect record against their San Di-
ego foes, winning the contest 12-5. 

UCSD took on the "Cal-Open" 
team in the final game of the week-
end for third place in the tourna-
ment. 

The Tritons led a balanced attack 
with a brand of water polo that in-
cluded driving and counterattack-
ing,and UCSD managed to keep the 
game close. But ears team, featur-
ing a numberof national team play-
ers, was finally able to top the Tri-
ton ,10-9. 

The UCSD Guardian 

UC Davis went on to win the 
tournament, knocking off Sunset in 
the championship game. 

The UCSD junior varsity team 
managed a surprising success, mak-
ing it a1l the way to the "B" divi ion 
championship where it eventually 
fell to a Canadian club tearn, 5-3. 

The Tritons had a minor scare in 
the Cal game when All-American 
Brenda Reiton injured her trapezius 
and was forced to leave the contest. 
Harper expects her back by nation-
als, however.

Women's Lacrosse Loses In May Madness 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's lacrosse 
team travelled to sunny Santa Bar-
bar.llast weekend, but gave up a day 
on the beach for a day on the field. 
The Tritons made the trip to take 
pan in the Western Women 's La-
crosse League Final Four. 

The Tritons faced UC Davis in 
the first game of the semi-finals. 
Despite four goals by team co-cap-
lain Deekla Marshall. UCSD was 
narrowly edged by the Aggies, 10 -
ing 11 -10. Other offensive leaders 
included co-captain Monique 
Mikrut, Kim Pogorelsky, Loc 

BASEBALL 
ContInued from page 11. 
Yates said, whose team currently 
holds the highest winning percent-
age in Triton history - .818. 

UCSD scored once in the fourth 
inning to even the tally at one, and 
finally broke the game open with 
three runs in the bottom of the sev-
enth. With one out, David Blum 
singled and promptly stole second 
base. Dave Valdez followed with a 
single to center field. putting run-
ners on the comers. 

A failed suicide squeeze attempt 

Nguyen and Michelle Reiss. 
The Tritons next faced Stanford 

in the third-place game. Again the 
game was a clo e one, and again 
Marshall powered the UCSD anack 
throwing in another four scores. but 
it was not enough, as the Cardinal 
pulled through with the narrow 9-8 
victory. 

Because of the rioting in Los 
Angele , the team was unable to 
leave for Santa Barbara until the 
morning of the toumament. "We 
were tired mentally and physically. 

- It was hard to leave really early and 
then get there and immediately have 
to play." Marshall said. 

nailed Blum at the plate, but Doran 
Yount followed with asingle to left, 
chasing Valdez home. Yount ad-
vanced to third on an error by the 
Coyote catcher, and pinch-hiller 
Marcos Magdaleno walked to put 
runners at the comers. 

Pinch-hitter Glenn Nahmias 
smoked a single to left, bringing 
Yount across, and an RBI single by 
Guy Cataldo concluded UCSD's 
three-run r.llly. 

Cataldo continues to wield the 
hottest bat in the Triton line-up as he 
pounded out two hits in four trips, 
including the RBI single. In his last 

UCSD also was playing with a 
rookie goalie, Lori Vanderhaak. 
tending the net. Nancy Reagan; the 
Tritons' normal starter, was side-
lined a couple of weeks ago with a 
broken foot and Vanderhaak has 
had the job since then. 

"[Vanderhaakl played excel-
lently," Marshall said. "We just 
didn't play our game. We could 
have done beller, but we're happy 
with what we've accomplished this 
season." 

Marshall . Reiss and Mikrut were 
selected to play on the west region 
team at the national lacrosse tourna-
ment in Maryland later thi month. 

three games, Cataldo has raised his 
average 55 points to .378 by ripping 
10 hits in 12 at-bats. 

While Hansen is adding his name 
to the record book, the UCSD bats-
men are also makjng a place for 
their own feats. Isola's 17 doubles 
are already a new Triton record, 
while his .426 pace would currently 
land him in second place. 

As a team, the II hits and 8 runs-
per-game are hovering above the 
current Triton records. The pitching 
staffs 3.03 ERA is slightly lower 
than the former best, a 3.06 mark 
posted in 1987.

H2 H iATUS 

I TIIOUGI n' I WAS GOING TO EXPERIENCE hell. I sat nervou Iy, waiting for the phone to ring. At long last the day had arrived: I was going to interview Nivek Ogre, the lead singer of the Vancouver-
based band Skinny Puppy. After alii had 
read about the band's notorious stage 

~how~ that have included violent images of 
executions, concentration camps, abortions 
and self-mutilation to name a few, I really 
Liidn't know what to expect. 

But Ogre was not at all what I had 
expected - he was more than willing to 
talk about the band and himself, pa.\t drug 
problems IIIcluded. And ~urprising ly, he 
was even excitable and cheery. 

Most people don't under~tand Skinny 
Puppy and nei ther had I. With all the 
nightmarish accounts I had read about the 
band's violent perfonnance~ and havi ng 
li stened to several albums full of Ogre's 
demon-like grunts (moans, barks, I really 
don't know whai to call it), I was sure that 
perhaps these guys had just retumed from a 
road trip to the Lake of Fi re. 

I couldn' t have been more wrong. Not 
only are the band members nm satanists -
Ogre even affirmed that they weren' t -
but also they are something of animal-
rights activists, having sung against 
vivisection in the past. 

So why the endless stream of violence, 
you a~k? Ogre see. it as a sort of shock-
treatment. 

"Nothing else real ly drives itself home," 
remarked Ogre. 

"The sick thi ng is that violence really is 
a big pan of our lives, and all we do i . 
suppre ' it, not deal with it. It completely 
motivates our behavior, yet we never seem 
to admit that to ourselves. You know the 
world's a violent world. It's not a safe 
place. 

"You know the water's not good to 
dri nk but you keep dri nking it anyway. I'm 
not at all a violent person, but I think it's 
important to confront people and shock 
them into dealing wi th the truth ' they're 
too afrJid to deal with," he said. 

Ogre draws a fi ne line betwee n wanting 
to affect people with violent imagery and 
want ing to change them. He prefers to u

the images to "challenge" and "provoke" 
rather than to change. If someone does 
change, it's only a sign that they ' 
confronted the i:.sue~ that Ski nny Puppy 
brought to their attent ion. 

" We have had a lot of people come 
up to us - people I've run into who 
did n't know who I was. We were in San 
Francisco a few weeks ago and a girl in 
an antique store we were in-said, ·Oh.' 

"She saw my jacket and went, ·Oh.

when I saw them.' That' the only way I 
can see that [the violence is] an effective

he said. 

Overloading audiences' mental 
circuits with video and synthes ized

have landed the band injail. At a show 
in Cincinnati , someone called the police 
to report , ironically, a case of crue lty to 
animals.

A re you into noise? If so, then you 'll love Last Rights, an album filled with plenty 
of that. Skinny Puppy's latest 
release combines an onslaught of 
harsh noises and soft, distant 
melodies, 

Most of the songs are quite slow 
and add conventional musical 
elements, but when combined with Ogre's constantly brooding 
lyrics and percussion break-ins, the album begins to sound like 
vintage Puppy and that whole " industrial" thing. 

The best songs, by far, are "Killing Game" and "Inquisition," 
"Inquisition" is especially seductive because of its captivating 
synthesized melody,

All in all , Ogre had plenty to say during 

the imerview. Some sound-bites:

YOII still get Ihose reactions from people 
GIld that willI/ever go away. So I'l'e always 
had that experience. 

Just as he believes that society continues 
to absorb violence without dealing with it, 
Ogre maintains that individuals create and 
perpetuate their own hell and their own 
demon . I had. in fact, managed to put 
myself through my own hell. 

Nivek Ogre turned out to be a near 
angel. The only tlanlCs I felt during the 
interview were the ones I had inflicted upon 
myself and the only devil I ran into was the

It i always a shame when an 
advertising team fora movie creates 
a promotional pacl\age which brings 
thoughts of mockery rather than an 
incentive to see the movie. 

The trailers for "K2" conjure up 
images of an arctic adventure, man 
against the icy wrath of nature. 

Unfortunately, these same trail-
ers also provoke images of a slightly 
s implistic, one-dimensional film . 
My expectations of"K2," the movie 
touting "The Ultimate High - The 
Adrenaline A lone Could Kill You," 
were far from grmd. 

Though the adrenaline was 
hardly fatal, the first half of " K2" 
(Rated R) did (urn out to be urpri s-
ingly good, emenaining the audi-
ence on many levels. 

The movie centers around two 
very different friends who have a 
c ommon pass ion - mountai n 
climbing. 

The more intriguing characterof 
the two is Seattle Ass istant District 
Attorney Taylor Brooks, played by 
Michael Biehn. 

Biehn is probably best known 
for playing physically c hallenging 
role in such fast-paced, vi ually 
stunning movies as "The Termina-
tor," "Aliens" and '''The Abyss" (all 
di rected by James Cameron). 

His role in " K2" is no less physi-

cally grueling, as Biehn portrays a 
reckless and adventuresome, yet tal-

Taylor' best friend and climb-
ing partner, Harold 1 amison (played 
by Matt Craven). offers a tark con-
trast in personalities . 

Taylor is the womanizer, as evi-
denced by his impulsive climb up an 
apartment building to reach two 
young bachelorettes . 

Harold is thedevoted family man, 
who still manages to di regard hi s

Above and Beyond: 'A Midnight Clear's' Keith Gordon 
By Scott Okamoto

I th ught I had never seen Keith 
G rd n before. but I was wrong. I 
... aw "The h olate War."the 1989 
film which he directed and wrote 
the ~creenplay for. but his name

"You sh uldn'tbeembarmssed," 
he laughed when I confe!>SCd that 
the only place I knew his face from 
was a Rodney Dangerfield movie. 
"Lots of people say the same thing, 
but I'm proud of my work as an 
actor. Right now my obse sion is 
directing and writing. but I'll al-
ways think of myself as an actor as

Gord n began his career in the 
movie industry as an actor and pro-
ducer on the independent feature 
"Slatic." for which he won the 
Madrid ilm Festival's Sest Act r 
award.

seen on the first page of the pres 
release as a deterrent to all unim-
pressed critics. 

1llere was quite a tir in and 
around Hollywood when A&M 
Films purchased the rights to "A 
Midnight Clear." "Everyone who 
read it loved it," G rd n said. "but 
making this movie proved to be too 
great a risk so no one wanted to put 
m ney into it." 

After several years and as many 
direct rs and actor!>. produ er Dale 
Pollack ("The Bea~t." "The Mighty 
Quinn ..... Worth Winning ... ··Blaze .. ) 
saw "The Chocolate War," and knew 
Ihal Gordon was righl for the j b. 

fter much debate and persi~tence. 
a 4-milli n budget was rai sed for 
the production of the movie. 

"$4 million is not a lot of money 
by H lIywood standards. but we 
were very pleased to get what we 
could." said Gordon. "No one 
wanted to make a movie that put 
World War II in a bad light because 

me rica still I ks at World War 11 
as the "good war ~ ught again tthe 
'bad guys.' I don ' t knO\ how many 
people asked. 'Why can'ty umake 
it Vietnam in tead?, Ithink it' . time 

that people realize that there is no 
such thing as a good war. All war is 
futile and. by it very nature, in-
sane." 

Being an actor benefited Gordon 
when it came to finding actors to 
bring hi project to life. "Not only 
did I have to find ix great actors. but 
ix great actors who could work 

well together in an ensemble." So, 
he relied on his instinct and chose 
Ethan Hawke. Gary Sinise. Frank 
Whaley, Peter Berg, Arye Gross, 
and Kevin Dillon as the principal 
players for"A Midnight Clear." 

Actors with big egos were not 
con idered for this movie. as flex-
ibility and a commitment to great 
film-making underh31'l.h condi tion 
were required. All ix principal ac-
tors shared the same trailer as they 
filmed in the snowy. mountainous 
region just outside of Park City. 
Utah. "If I told you what ea h actor 
was paid forthis project. you 'd know 
what a labor of love thi was." Gor-
don said. 

With this project over. Gordon is 
already preparing for everdl other 
projects. including another feature 
film, and work with Kurt Vonnegut 

K2 
ContInued from page H3 
wealthy expedition leader Phillip 
Claibome (Raymond 1. Barry). 

The group alludes to the fact that 
a major expedition is in the work . 

After an "une pected" tum of 
events - exactly two members of 
Phillip's expedition are conve-
niently killed off by an avalanche 
- Taylorand Harold are persuaded 
to join the climbing team. 

Their goal. K2. is the second 
hjghest mountain in the world, at 
28.250fcct.andcon ideredthemo t 
difficult mountain to climb. 

The firs t half of "K2" provide 
plenty of breathtaking cinematog-
raphy, inten e action and humor 
thrown in for good measure. 

Biehn is especially impre sive 
a the renegade living life to its 
fu llest. The rescue scene during a 
cave-in on Godwin Austen Glacier 
will have you riveted to the screen. 

While the first half of "K2" is 
fault Ie s. the second hal f is a major 
letdown - the "adrenaline" failed 
to ustain the m vie' s heartbeat. 

Even the "climax" occurring on 
K2' ummit generated few emo-
ti n andhardlythe'high'or'rush' 

on various film and television ideas. 
"Yes, I did meet Kurt for the first 
time on the set of "Back to School." 
but I was so intimidated by him that 
I actually said very little to him. It 
wasn't until I was re-introduced t.hat 
I began a working relationship with 
him," Gordon said. 

TIle next project,irn' t quite set, 
but so far Gordon ha., established a 
definite pattern with his film . 1l1e 
theme of acrifice has played a sig-
nificant role in both "The Chocolate 
War." and" A Midnight Clear." with 
both films containing a "Christ fig-
ure." 

"That i kind of international on 
my part. I gue 's," Gordon said 
thoughtfully. " I sti ll am attracted to 
the idea of religion. I am Jewish, 
although I am not particularly reli-
gious myself. 

I do wish I could be. but there's 
just too much to take in when you 
talk about organized religion. It 
seems to bring out the very best and 
the very worst in everyone." 

A religiou theme may not be 
included in the next Gordon film. 
but you can be sure that the concept 
of good and evil within everyone 

will be. There are no perfectly good 
people in Gordon's films. 

1l1e "good guys" have their 
flaws and the "bad guys" have their 
redeeming qualities, and although 
this doesn't make for a box office 
smash. it does make the film more 
honest and true to life. "Basically, 
we're all Nazis. and we' re all Mother 
11leresas. Everyone is capable of an 
incredible amount of good as well 
as an incredible amount of hate and 
evil," said Gordon. 

The process of making the next 
project happen is becoming easier 
these days for Gordon. The critical 
u cess of "A Midnight Clear" has 

opened doors previously closed to 
him. "Just today. I talked with a 
company that refused to help me 
before "A Midnight Clear." But. 
suddenly they are very friendly and 
willing to help with my next project. 
whatever that may be." 

Keith Gordon has provided se-
lective filmgoers with two memo-
rable and challenging movies. in 
addition to his mainstream movie 
acting. It is rare to find such a di-
versely talented individual in the 
film industry.

dire tor Franc Roddam intended. 
"K2." taken in part • doe offer 

elements of great filmmaking. 
Yet as a whole, it various weak-

ne es result in an avalanche to\ ard 
mediocrity. 

ometimes a film can get away 
with mediocrity, "K2" is one of 
tho e films where mediocrity ruin~ 
the point and ruins the film. 

WHAT: "K2" 
WORTH $71: "K2" is 
an average film with above 
average cinematography 
thrown in to get viewers. 
The film fizzles out after 
the first half. Only worth 
about $3.25.
