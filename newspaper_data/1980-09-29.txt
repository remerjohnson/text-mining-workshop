Vending Prices Are Hiked Muir Dorin Hit By A Vandal's 'BoOlb' 
Blame Put 
On Inflation 

BY ALICE ROCKEY 
Staff Writer 

Inflation has struck 
again, says UCSD Director 
of Auxiliary Enterprises 
Larry Barrett, explaining 
the price increases at 
campus vending machines. 

These increases, which 
became effective July 1, 
reflect the rising cost of the 
products sold in the 
machines, says Barrett. 

Almost all prices rose, 
from five cents for soft 
drinks, candy - and 
cigarettes, and up to twenty 
cents lor some cold lood 
such as sandwiches and 
yogurt. 

Barrett does not foresee 
any further vending price 
increases for the upcoming 
fiscal year. 

"We try only to raise 
prices once a year unless 
something unexpected 
happens, like when sugar 
prices double," he says. 

UCSD leases the 80 to 
90 campus vending 
machines from ARA on a

the Campus Aparbnents One, 
the New Mesa Aparbnents 
will house 200 under-
graduates, 80 married and 40 
s,ingle graduate students, and 

some faculty members. 
The faculty members, 

mostly new professors, will live 
in a separate section of the 
complex, which should be 
completed by next summer. 

Harper Development, Inc. 
of San Diego, which built the 
Third and Warren College 
apartments, was contracted 
by the university .to build the 
New Mesa aparbnents after 
winning a contract competi-

tion. 
The estimated cost of the 

housing project in the 
contract is $11 million, 
although more recent figures 
indicate an actual under-
budget cost of $9 million.

police as 'a tall, white male,

CAPE through questi naires

Student comments are 
edited to give the reader a eel 
for every professor or class. In 
some cases a course 
description is provided, as weQ 
as average weekly studying 
time and a percentage of those 
who recommend the class. 

This year's format omits 
most statistical information 
artd an increase in comments 
to provide students with a 
more compact guide to the 
course of their choice. 
Statistics showing students'

CAPE's director, Kate 
'Sullivan, agrees that 
"inasmuch as teaching is 
cc\unted, CAPE is used almost 
exdusively." Yet she hesitates 
to speculate on how important 
the ewaluations are in ,",anting 
or refusing faculty tenure, as 

other factors, such as 
protessional competence, 
community service and 
especially research, are 
considered. 

CAPE originated in 1973 
along with the Student 
Educational Change Center. 
Students concerned about the 
quality of education at UCSD 
sought funding from the 
Chancellor's Advisory 
Committee on Instructional 
Improvement and formed a 
collective, becoming one of the 
first student evaluation 
services in the UC system. 

To accomplish its task of 
compiling and anaryzing 
student opinions, CAPE hires 
approximately 16 student 
'runners' each quarter. 

During the fifth week of 
each quarter 'runners' 
distribute questionnaires in 
most classes. Students 
respond to c9re questions

Two weeks ago-Damascus,Ark.; 
but tomorrow - it's the world 
BY GEOFFREY BROWN 
The explosion of the Titan 

II miaaile in Arkansas two 
weeki ago has produced 
rather predictable reactions 
from both aides of the nuclear 
weapons issue. 

Proponents of greater 
defense 1pflIIding, of course, 
caJIed for replacing the Til8lll 
with newer ' milliles. J_ u 
predictably, anti·nuclear 
critic. suddenly were 
empathizing with the worried 
residents of DamaICUI, Ark. 
Both issues .e important, of 
course, but they overlook the 
truly critical illUe in nuclear 

~today. 

if Ruslia attacked us fir.t, why 
would we want to .hoot at their 
mislile lilos? They'd be 
empty. The only reason for 
aiming at their missiles is to be 
able to attack them first, in an 
attempt to knock out all their 
milliles. 

be detected by enemy radar, 
couldn't it attack Russian 
missiles before they knew what 
hit them? And isn't that 
pinpoint accuracy much better 
for seeking out missiles than 
for hitting large targets like 
citie.? 

Thai key issue is: ahouId the 
United .stales be preparinJ to 
lIart a nuclear war? Granted, 
it seem. preposterous at lirat 
a1ance. But a growing nwnber . 
of Pentalon·watchers -
among them former millae 
deailner Robert Aldridge -
are pointing to ominous ligns 
that US strategy is now aimed 
at attacking the RUiliana 
before they attack us. 
Consider theae two recent 
developments: 

-Much has been made of 
Carter'l recent revelation. 
about the 'stealth bomber.' But 
that'. old new., Itrategy.wise. 
For yea,. we've been 
developing the cruise millae 
- a tiny raadear weapon 
which flies at tree·lop level 
under enemy radar, traveling 
up to 3,000 miles lo explode 
within 200 y.c:Ia of ill target. 
It IOtII1da admirably dever- at

The cruise missile i. not 
elpecially useful for 
retaliation; it'. meant for 
attacking first. The.ame 80eI 
for the MX miIIae, whose 
awesome accuracy and high 
exploalve power make it more 
useful in destroying miss~es 
rather than cities. 

But one might well argue: 
Why not attack them firlt? 
Why not put our carda on the

NEWS BRIEFS 

Brown Signs Bill, OK's 
Legal Use of Laetrile 

SACRAMENTO - Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. has signed 
a bill lega~zing the use of 
Laetrile on a limited number of 
cancer patients, his office said 
yester-day. 

Laetrile is Iiterallr. the 
squeezings of the kerne • from 
inside the pits of apricots and 
bitter almonds, and is present 
in numerous other ~~. 

Its promote,., including a 
very few medical doctors, cite 
any number of individuals who 
claim to have had cancer that 
was cured by Laetrile. 

But orthodox cancer 
researchers say there has 
never been any .cientific proof 
that Laetrile ever cured 
anyone 01 cancer or anything 
else. 

The bal, SB1580 by Sen. 
William Campbell, R· 
Hacienda Heights, authorizes 
the u.e of the substance onl)' 
on certain terminally ill 
patients, and others in 
principal medical school 
hospitals, until 1985. 

It also requires an 

"informed con.ent" procedure 
for all patients aimed at 
informing them of the nature of 
Laetrile, and asluring them 
that it need not be taken at the 
exclulion of orthodox 
treatment. 

Campbell told numer-OUI 
hearing. during the five years 
he was trying to pass that bill 
that the effectiveness of 
Laetrile against cancer was 
not the main point. He .aid the 
main point was the freedom of 
the victims to be able lo choose 
their own treatment. 

Opponents testified that 
Laetrile i. being promoted for 
profit as "a cruel hoax" on 
desperate cancer victim •. But 
scientists admit that Laetrile 
has caused many patients to 
feel better and have better-
appetites. 

Brown endorsed the biD 
early this year, citing freedom 
of choice - which hal for 
year. been the slogan of many 
of the promoters, many 01 
whom are organized into 
pres.ure groups.

receives a percentage of the 
total sales back from ARA 
as a commission. The 
commission paid last year 
was $51,000, S30,OOO of 
which was distributed 
among the coUeges and 
various student organiza-
tions. The remainder was 
earmarked for utility . 
maintenance and admini-
strative co.ts. 

Barrett does not expect 
any larger profits to be 
made on the machines this 
year, as a drop in buainelll 
has accompanied the price 
hike. He attributes the close 
proximity to the machines 
to Walk's Pub and the 
Sunshine Store on Warren 
campus to the decline in 
buaineas.

Bad Political 
Combination 
I continued from page 2 I will agree with the letter 

that it is unlikely that the 
presidential candidates do not 
believe in the Bible and that 
they are only trying to make 
political advances. I am sure 
they do believe in it. And that 
is why we have such a poor 
selection of president ia l 
candida tes. 

CASEY HOPSON 

Defense Policy: 
Is it Prudent? 
continued from page 2 
can't be done. They have too 
many missiles. 

If only 100 Russian missiles 
(out of their 5,(00) can escape 
our attack, they can retaliate 
and kill 37 million Americans 
and destroy two-thirds of US 
industrial capacity. A first-
strike just won't work. 

So what can be done? At a 
minimum, the United States 
should state unequivocally 
that we will never be the first to 
UIe nudear weapons. To 
make this simple declaration 
- which, by the way, we have 
never done - would go a long 
way toward reassuring the 
Ruasians about our intentions. 

Secondly, the Senate should 
approve the stranded SAL T II 
treaty which Russia has 
already agreed to. 1be treaty, 
of courae, merely limits 
increases in weaponry -
rather than making cutbacks 
- but at least it's a start. 

Lastly, we should clearly 
indicate our wmingness to 
move gradually toward step-
by-step mutual disarmament 
without compromising our 
national security.
