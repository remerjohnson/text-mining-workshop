... , .... Evaluations 
LOS ANGELES - The 
UCLA English Department 
recently discovered that a 
department staff member had 
destroyed "a few" unfavorable 
T A evaluations before they 
could reach the evaluation 
processilfg Office. Although 
TAs - unlike professors -
are not required to keep their 
evaluations on file; department 
members agreed that the 
missing evaluations could 
have skewed the results 
attained by the processing 
office. English Department 
Chair Eric Sundquist said the 
person responsible has been 
disciplined, and that the 
incident will not be repeated.

Sewage Flood. 
100-Year Old Dorm 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -
Emergency repairs are almost 
complete on the century-old 
Random Hall dormitory at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, two weeks after a 
blocked chimney and sewage 
backups forced the evacuation 
of the building. Refuse water 
and toilet paper flooded the 
building's electrical room and 
at least one student's bedroom. 
Although MIT will stop using 
the aging building as a 
dormitory within the next 10 
years, housemaster Nina 
Davis-Miller said resid~nts 
still have the right to "a certain 
level of maintenance." MIT 
police are currently investigat-
ing the chimney incident, 
which they suspect was caused 
by a disgruntled resident.

Stude~ Regent Selection Committee 
Picks UCSD Student as Semifinalist 
HONOR: ERC junior Gabriela Juarez and four others beat out 28 
applicants in the Southern California region 
ByTedd Ledd 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students may soon gain a representa-
tive voice on the UC Board of Regents, if Gabriela 
Juarez has anything to say about it. The Roosevelt 
junior advanced Saturday to the semifinals of 
the UC student regent selection process. 

Juarez was one of five southern region semi-
finalists, selected from a pool of 28 applicants. 
The other semifinalists included three UCLA 
students and one UC Santa Barbara student. 

During her three years at UCSD, Juarez has 
served as ERC sophomore senator and chair of 
the University Centers Advisory Board, among 
other accomplishments. 

"As demonstrated by her long list of in-
volvements, she's very dedicated," said A.S. 
President Naomi Falk, who was a member of 
the southern region selection committee. 

The five southern region semifinalists -
and four northern region semifinalists, who 
were also selected Saturday - will travel to UC 
San Francisco on Jan. 2, 1996, for a final round 
of interviews conducted by the UC Student 
Association (UCSA). 

UCSA will then submit its three finalists to 
the regents, who will make their final selection 
during the second weekend of January. 

"I feel like its an honor just to have gotten 
this far," Juarez said.

UCSD research computer analyst David 
Hessler was shot and killed outside his Univer-
sity City home last Tuesday by a thief who may 
have been attempting to burglarize his car. 

According to San Diego Police Lieutenant 
Glenn Breitenstein, the 30-year-old Hessler heard 
a suspicious noise coming from his driveway at 
2: 15 a.m. When Hessler went outside to inves-
tigate the source of the noise, he discovered an 
individual (or individuals) trying to break into 
his black Nissan Pathfinder. The culprit shot 
Hessler once in the chest before fleeing.

UPTE Demands $3 Million in Withheld Wages 
PROTEST: Union 
members say university 
reneged on agreement 
By Suketu lIallhnav 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 15 of UCSD's 
550 technical employees gathered 
at Interim Chancellor Marjorie 
Caserio'soffice last Thursday, de-
manding that they and their co-
workers receive $3 million in what 
they claim are illegally withheld 
wages. 

According to University Profes-
sional and Technical Employees 
(UPTE) union members, the UC 
administration had promised non-

unionized UC employees, then in-
cluding technical employees, a 2.2-
percent cost-of-living adjustment, a 
O.S-percent incentive award and 
additional merit increases. 

All UC employees - with the 
exception of the technical employ-
ees - received the promised ben-
efits, UPTE members said. 

The employees had gathered to 
present Caserio with a greeting card 
and fake checks in the amount they 
would have received if the 2.2-per-
cent cost-of-living adjustment had 
been added to their pay. 

Caserio was at the UC Board of 
Regents' meeting in San Francisco 
on Thursday, however, so UCSD 
Assistant Police Chief John Dyer 

accepted the card and the checks. 
Dyer said he would deliver them 

to the chancellor upon her return. 
He was unavailable for comment, 
however. 

"One of our goals was to be 
merely noticeable enough to Case rio 
and let her know the gravity of the 
circumstances at hand," said David 
Kesner, a recording technician with 
17 years of experience in the UCSD 
Music Library. 

UC administrators notified UPTE 
on Nov. 18 of last year that aU non-
unionized would receive the prom-
ised raises. 

However, when UPTE was cer-
tified as the exclusive bargaining 
agent for the nearly 4,000 UC tech-

nical employees in a collective vote 
on Dec. 1, the university informed 
UPTE that the technical employees 
would not receive the previously 
promised incentives. 

"The university will n01 get 
away with this clear retaliation for 
technical employees voting for 
union representation," UPTE San 
Diego President Jelger Kalmijn 
said. 

UPTE filed charges of unfair la-
bor practices with the Public Em-
ployees Relations Board (PER B) in 
January, in response to the ue's 
decision to withhold the previously 
guaranteed pay increases. 

The union argued that the uni-
versity would be violating the Higher 

Education Employer/Employee Re-
lations Act, section 3571, by refus-
ing to honor the agreement. 

Union members said that accord-
ing to state bylaws, the university 
cannot renounce agreements made 
prior to voting for union representa-
tion. 

The university maintained from 
March through August of this year 
that it had the lawful right to revoke 
its earlier agreement with the UC 
technical employees. 

As a result of the dispute, PERB 
held six days of hearings between 
the technical workers and the UC 
administration. A decision is ex-
pected to be announced later this 
month.

Man Controls' His 
Own Destiny 

By Farsam Shadab 
Special to the Guardian 

echnology is man's servant, not his master. By 
definition, technology cannot rule man; only man 

can rule man. But in a free society, men do not rule 
other men. And only in a free society can technologi-
cal progress take place. These facts are proportional: 
The more freedom there is in a given society - in other 

words, the less restrictions placed on individuals - the more tech-
nology will progress. 

Technology, at the most fundamental level, is any-
thing which succeeds in simplifying man 's life. In 
the realm of human laboring, simplification is 
the top value. However, this is not because 
those benefiting from the newly achieved 
efficiency can do less. Simplification is of 
value primarily because it allows man to 
do more. 

Technology is man-made, and is thus 
man's existential counterpart. It is our ideas given 
physical form. But history has never confirm nor recog-
nize this fact. Technology has been relegated from its proper po-

-

sition as a true asset to the false role of a liability. Anti-technologists see 
it as a burden, an impediment or as the shackles and tools of exploitation. 

In fact, Karl Marx saw technology, along with commerce, as the tool 
of oppression. Even today, modem liberals, still anchored in Marxist 
waters, attack industry on various fronts. In the final analysis, attacks on 
technology originate from the notion that progress can be bad or, even 
worse, that man can be bad. 

To begin, one cannot consider the question of technology outside the 
setting of society. Enumerating the virtues of technology is useless un-

less one establishes the conditions within 
Technology'.

Oearly, rnan can "handle" technology-
just as he can handle his hands, le~, thoughts 
and actions. Without technology, man is little 
different from othe~ animals. Technology de-
rives from man's single defining attribute as 
a member of the animal kingdom: the capac-
ity to reason. Faculties such as language and 
speech qualify as technology, as man's ap-
plication of his reason to the goal of survival 
(in this ease, communications technology). 

Because man has no instinctual knowl· 
edge, he must figure out how to survive. He 

technology glv ..

build his nest or catch his prey. He must learn how to do 10, and he can 
~nsequently improve and build upon his knowledge, as history proves. 
This is the inviolable link between man and technology. 

The most oulstaDding quality of technological progress is its relation-
ship to each individual in society, most significantly in its non~mmit­
tal nature_ Each individual chooses whether he wants to use the technol-
ogy before him. In caence, technology gives III options. Contrary ':D

fld is not a quality of technology per Ie, but of a free nwl:et-bued

a free society can provide man with such variability of choice.

Technology, then, can also be de-

The truth of the mailer is that 
whenever technology is involved in 
an instance of injustice, its utilization 
in the act is inconsequential and ines-

It is pure madness to impugn in·

sloughed off onto technology's back, 
time and time again. Such false in-
crimination is, in effect, just shifting 
culpability from the real source: po-
Iitical ideologies which allow indi-
vidual rights to be violated. Such cra-
ven Ludditetry, given momentum by 
the pestilence of modem liberalism, 
ought to be seen for the sham that it 
is. Its success rests on the creation of 
a straw enemy. 

Technology qua technology sim-
ply cannot be a source or cause of in-
justice. It can only be a passive ac-
complice. Marxism denies this whole-
sale, contending that technology and 
its constituencies - industry and 
progress -are merely fixtures for the 
elite. Not only is the elite class able 
to manipulate commerce and indus-

created the elite to begin with.

carry out business transactions on the

he can spoil a perfectly good lunch 
with extra work. No longer is the 
lunch hour so coveted for its reprieve

drive to the restaurant is often spent 
on the phone, discussing still more 
business. Often, a businessman can 
spend his entire meal· on the phone, 
trying his best to cram in as much 
work into the day as possible. 

Also, with technology, the busi-
nessman can take his work home 
with him as never before. No longer

Technology's main goal should be 
to take care of man's necessities. If

enjoy life's relaxing pleasures. And

COMMENTARY: With locks, keys, alarms and more, our generation has fallen victim to 
not trusting its fellow human beings - a problem which does not offer an easy solution 

LIVING IN A DISHONEST SOCIETY 
By Wayne Wona 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Much discussion has ensued as 
to whether or not the quality of life 
today is better than that of previous 
generations. In many ways, it is. 
We've made medical breakthroughs 
and tcchnological advances at an ex-

ponentia� rate. Diseases such as po-
lio - which was once thought in-
curable- have been virtually eradi-
cated. Computers today are faster 
than anyone could have imagined 
30 years ago. But what about the in-
tangibles? How do our morals com-
pare to those of our parents and 
grandparents? 

This is one area in which we are 
greatly lacking, especially with re-
spect to honesty. People today are 
simply less honest than they were 
in the past. What is even worse, 
though, is how acceptable dishon-
esty has become. 

One indication of the present . 
level of dishonesty is the number of 
antitheft devices we have in this 
country: bike locks, door locks, win-
dow bars, house alarms, car alarms, 
detachable-face stereos, barbed-
wire, razor wire, electric fences and 
- my personal favorite - the Club. 
Even the computer I used for this 
commentary has a lock for security. 

I'm not saying we don't need 
these things. It's just sad that we do. 
People are always afraid that others 
will take everything they have. We 
may not realize it, but we are living 
in constant fear. We don't see this 

SERVING UCSD for 15YEARS! 

fear because we are right in the 
middle of it. We have grown up not 
trusting people. 

Try to imagine not having to 
worry about locking your doors or 
your bike or your car. It's difficult. 
For example, getting out of your car 
has become an involved ritual, yet 
we hardly notice its complexity. 
Hide your CDs, take out your radio, 
put on your Club, roll up the win-
dows.lock the doors, arm the alarm, 
check the door locks and, finally, 
take one last look back as you walk 
away. 

All these preventative measures 
take their toll on us. They burden 
us with unnecessary cost and hassle, 
all because people won't respect the 
fact that they have no right to things 
that don't belong to them. It's 
sounds so simple: Don ~ take things 
that don ~ belong to you. It's prob-
ably even in one of those stupid, 
little, plaid "Books of the Obvious." 
We were told over and over as chil-
dren to respect the belongings of 
others, and yet, as adults, we have 
such difficulty abiding by that rule. 

Another rampant manifestation 
of dishonesty is lying -little or big, 
cruel or jesting, intentional or acci-
dental. Though it is true that some 
lies are necessary to prevent embar-
rassing situations or undue sutTer-
ing, the vast majority of lies are self-
serving. We lie to get ourselves out 
of situations we create, we lie for 
undeserved gain and, in the end, we 
lie mostly to cover up previous lies.

you walk away. 

An epidemic of lies has pervaded 
our society. It has come to a point 
where such dishonesty is expected, 

leaving most people with a pessi-
mistic view of their fellow human 
beings. This is one reason why we 
grow up not trusting each other. We 
all fear that the "other guy" is just 
as dishonest as we are. 

Lies are as pervasive at UCSD 
as they are anywhere else. You 
might say, "No, not at this monu-
ment of ideals." But, sadly, even in 
this haven of higher learning, men-
dacity exists. There are two major 
forms of dishonesty at universities. 
The first and most obvious is cheat-
ing. 

Cheating is more widespread 
than most people would think. With 
500 overambitious students in a 
class with five TAs and one profes-
sor, there are bound to be some 
meandering eyes. At one time or 
another, we've all either perpetrated 
or witnessed this deplorable act. Of 
course, we find a multitude of rea-
sons to justify it, none of which is 
valid. The test was too hard, my 
parents expect too much, it was just 
a quiz or - perhaps the lamest rea-
son of all - the professor made it 
too easy to cheat. 

The second and more subtle 
form of dishonesty in schools is pla-
giarism. Occasionally, it occurs be-
cause students don't realize that 
they're actually doing it. However, 
more often than not, it is the result 
of a lazy mind that would rather 
steal the great thoughts of others 
than go to the trouble of formulat-
ing an original idea. Again, people 

take what doesn't belong to them. 
The last form of venality is theft. 

From bikes to books, anything not 
bolted do~n is considered fair 
game. Just the other day, I saw a 
posted flyer requesting the return of 
a stolen stereo, no questions asked. 
Have we become so desperate that 
we are no asking the thieves them-
selves to return stolen items? 

Perhaps the saddest Ihing about 
this pandemic infection of dishon-
esty is what it teaches the next gen-
eration. Not only do we teach chil-
dren not to trust others, but we also 
teach them to lie. 

They will be the ones running the 
world in the future. We can't expect 
to cure - or even want to cure -
the maladies of the world if we can-
not trust each other. We can't give 
our hatred a rest if we always sleep 
with one eye open. Before we can 
etTectively tackle global problems, 
we must do all we can to solve per-
sonalones. 

It's easy to preach from a soap-
box. I should know, I've been do-
ing it this entire article. But what 
about solutions? I don't see an 
easy one. This isn't the type of 
problem that can be fixed with leg-
islation or the heroic acts of one 
person. It requires a subtle and 
unified change in attitude from 
each and every member of soci-
ety. In the end, all we can really 
do is change our own approach-
and hope that we can change oth-
ers by our example.

REGENTS DESERVE CRITICISM FOR FEE HIKES 
Editor: 

To a small degree , Nathan 
Pietila is right: California 's reces-
sion has forced our legislature to 
place a large part of the financial 
burden upon California 's public 
higher-edu<;ation system and has 
confronted the UC Board of Re-
gents with the reality of a dwin-
dling budget ("Economic Reces-
sion Justifies Boost in Tuition," 
Nov. 13, 1995). 

However, the regents' options on 
how to deal with the cuts are not 
limited. Over the last three years, ' 
state funding to the General Fund 
has decreased by $340 million. Dur-
ing that time, the regents have dem-
onstrated an unwillingness to con-
sider any other measure beyond cut-
ting staff and faculty salaries or rais-
ing the revenue generated by student 
fees, as a means for coping with 
these cuts. 

Meanwhile, administrative sala-
ries have drastically increased - as 
much as 21 percent in one year for 
hospital administrators. The UC 
budget is complex, with hundreds 
of sources of revenue and expendi-
tures. Yet, for years, raising student

fees has been considered the sole 
source of generating expendable, 
discretionary revenue. 

Pietila failed to point out that, 
although the current financial·aid 
policy requires a portion of money 
'generated from student fees to be 
returned to financial aid, it in no way 
satisfies the need. Currently, 33 per-
cent is returned to aid, while roughly 
50 percent ofthe student population 
is eligible for aid. The drastic de-
cline in the amount of work-study 
and grant dollars available has al-
lowed many students to fall through 
the cracks. 

Past criticism of the regents is 
both justified and merited. They 
have enacted almost a decade of 
student fee increases without a 
viable long-term fee policy and 
sufficient financial aid to protect 
the access of students with fewer 
resources. The regents' lack of 
long-term vision in their policy-
making has endangered both the 
quality of the university and the 
access for California citizens. 

Recent criticism of the regents 
is even more deserved than ever.

cated $29.5 million to California's 
General Fund. In doing so, they 
have demonstrated that higher edu-
cation in the state of California is a 
priority. Despite this positive devel-
opment, the regents have requested 
insufficient funding in their initial 

budget request to the governor for the 
1996-97 year, necessitating a 7.1-per-
cent fee increase to adequately fund 
the university. 

In all previous years, the regents 
have at least asked for sufficient fund-
ing and then, when rcceiving less, they 
raised student fees. This will be the 
first year t-hat they have asked for a 
fee increase in their initial budget re-
quest. 

The regents have a misguided idea 
that asking for sufficient funding 
would be a betrayal of Gov. Pete 
Wilson 's trust. 

Last January, Wilson, UC Budget 
Director Larry Hircsman and the CSU 
president entered inlo an agreement 
concerning the CSU and UC systems, 
called the Governor's Compact with 
Higher Education. This document 
promised both systems insufficient 
funding that would necessitate a 1O~ 
percent fee increase e ltVery year for 
the next four years. Compounded,this 
amounts to a SO-percent fee increase 
in four years 

This agreement was illegal, accord-
ing to the state constitution. The 
governor's budget must go through the 
state legislature every year. However, 

Navy Career Fair at an 
..... A CA.REER FA.IR FOR 

the legislature never voted to pass 
it. 

The regents all seem to believe 
that they must abide by this docu-
ment and ask for less funding than 
we need to operate the university. 

Student Regent Ed Gomez has 
placed the compact on the Nov. 
16 regents' agenda. Despite the 
fact that it is a very flawed docu-
ment, the regents will probably 
pass it. After all, they have al-
ready demonstrated with their 
decision to axe affirmative action 
that they are willing to violate the 
California State Constitution by 
allowing their personal politics to 
mediate their governance of the 
university. 

We, as students, need to send 
a clear message to the regents: 
There is no room for further fee 
increases. The regents must be-
gin to behave as the guardians of 
a world-renowned university sys-
tem to which they have been ap-
pointed to serve. They must re-
move themselves from external 
politics.

DEATH: Hessler 
lauded personally 
and professionally 
Continued from pea- 1 

Paramedics pronounced Hessler 
dead at the scene. 

Breitenstein said there were no 
eyewitnesses to the incident, but 
that neighbors reported hearing a 
vehicle speeding away at approxi-
mately the same time as the shoot-
ing. 

According to the Wednesday, 
Nov. 15 issue of the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, the vehicle left a 
30-foot skid-mark on the pave-
ment. 

"We know there was a vehicle, 
but we do not know how maily 
people were involved, "Breitenstein 
said. 

Hessler left some computer 
equipment inside his car the night of 
the shooting, in anticipation of a 
conference he was to attend early 
the next morning. 

"We do not know whether [the 
culprits] werejusttrying to steal the 
car, the equipment or both," 
Breitenstein said. 

Police said they have dusted 
the Pathfinder for fingerprints, but 
that they cannot disclose the de-
tails of any evidence obtained be-
cause the shooting is still under 
investigation. 

David Hessler worked at the 
National Center for Microscopy and 
Imaging Research (NC/MIR), lo-
cated within the neuroscience de-
partment of the UCSD School of 
Medicine. 

One of only five of its kind in the 
country, the NC/MIR is home to the 

Intermediate-Voltage Electron Mi-
croscope - a S 1 million, 400,000-
volt instrument that provides three-
dimensional images for biomedical 
research. 

"David was responsible for the 
design, development, maintenance 
and updating of certain computer-
graphics software packages, and was 
a key participant in the design of 
newly developed software called 

-DUCKY," Ellisman said. 
DUCKY produces visualizations 

of minuscule biological structures 
with the aid of the medical school's 
electron microscope. 

Hessler had planned to demon-
strate the software at the annual neu-
roscience meeting - held in the 
San Diego Convention Center -
the morning of the incident. 

Hessler began his work nearly 
nine years ago, as a student intern 
at the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center (SDSC). Hessler was an 
undergraduate in UCSD's com-
puter science department at the 
time. 

"We knew Dave was bright and 
talented when he worked here as a 
student intern and began the pro-
gramming effort that was to be his 
life's work," SDSC director Dr. 
Sidney Karin said. 

After graduation, Hessler joi ned 
the UCSD Medical School's Labo-
ratoryforNeurocytology-agroup 
led by Neuroscience Professor Mark 
H. Ellisman. 

"We felt lucky that he was able 
to join our laboratory," Ellisman 
said. "[Hessler] was one of the best 
and brightest people to work in my 
lab." 

Forthelast few years, Ellisman's 
group has been working on acquir-

ing digital imagery from a special 
camera on the Intermediate-Volt-
age Electron Microscope. 

Ellisman said Hessler's work in 
reconstructing and visualizing the 
microanatomy of neurons is "noth-
ing short of brilliance." 

"The images and animations 
Dave produced have given neuro-
scientists everywhere new insight 
into the relationships between neu-
ral structure and function," Ell isman 
added. 

Hessler also developed software, 
called SVNU, which allows seien-

tists to ~mbine two-dimensional 
slices of neural tissue to form whole 
reconstructions of neurons. 

Ellisman, who is also a senior 
fellow at the SDSC, said this soft-
ware is the "centerpiece" of the 
group's visualization efforts, and 
believes it is a "visionary approach" 
to neural microanatomy. 

Hessler's other colleagues, who 
were shocked by the senseless mur-
der, had nothing but praise for him. 
Steve Lamont, his co-worker in the 
lab, described Hessler as 'a "unique, 
creative individual"who always had 

an "off-the-wall perspective" to 
share, 

"It was a privilege to work with 
[Hessler] and I will miss him terri-
bly," he added. 

Hessler is survived by his par-
ents and his' fiancee, Kim Koney, 
whom he was planning to marry in 
March. 

Hessler's father, Dr. Robert 
Hessler, is a marine biologist at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanogra-
phy (SID).

REGENTS: 
University maintains

Continued from paC. 1 
salaries as a priority . 

"The regents would like to have 
no increas~ in~ student fees, but they 
also want to ensure that faculty sala-
ries are also brought into equity," 
UC President Richard Atkinson said. 
"There has been an interesting dis-
cussion about where that balance 
should sit." 

Student reaction to the budget 
proposal was less positive overall , 
as several students cited the general 
7.1-percent fee increase as avoid-
able. 

" I have seen a lot of fat, and 
needs for cuts, in this budget," A.S. 
Statewide Affairs Director and 
Revelle sophomore Greg Field said. 
"I urge you [the board] to lobby 
vehemently for a zero-percent fee 
increase and to lobby the state legis-
lature. " 

A.S. President Naomi Falk also 
voiced displeasure over the expen-
diture side of the budget approved 
by the regents.

aren ' t paying our faculty what we

should," Falk said, "but it makes 
me angry that the regents are pit-
ting faculty against students by 
implementing faculty salary in-
creases along with student fee in-
creases." 

During Hershman's budget pre-
sentation at Thursday 's meeting, he 
stressed the nced for better compen-
sat ion for faculty members - who 
he said earn considerably less than 
their peers at comparable universi-
ties. 

In a study conducted by the UC 
Office of the President comparing 
faculty salaries at eight noteworthy 
schools-including Harvard, Yale, 
Stanford and MIT - UC faculty 
salaries lagged by an average mar-
gin of 10.4 percent.

but also in keeping fac-
ulty that we have," 
Atkinson said. "The 
board's view is that we 
have to maintain the qual-
ity of the faculty, and that 
everything else will fol-
low." 

"lfwe losequalityfac-
ulty, we are going to un-
dermine the quality of 
education, undermine the 
research programs of the 
university," Atkinson 
added. 

NEWS 9 

Ivan In its 1996-97 budget proposal, 
the UC is requesting a two-percent, 
cost-of-Iiving salary adjustment for 
all university employees, as well as 
a three-percent "equity adjustment" 
for faculty only. 

Several board mem-
bers echoed Atkinson's 
remarks, that for the UC 
system to remain com-
petitive, faculty salaries 
must be rapidly adjusted 
to equal faculty salaries 
at other institutions. 

Rullnc: UC President Richard Atkinson presides over Thursday's regents ' 
meeting. The regents vowed to raise faculty salaries to competitve levels. 

The faculty increase would be 
the first step in a three-year plan 
which seeks to match the faculty 
salaries found at comparable uni-
versities. 

"We are in competition for fac-
ulty from around the country, not 
only in terms of recruiting faculty 

The board set three priorities for 
its January meeting, pending the 
availability of additional funds in 
the Jan. 10 state budget proposal. 

First, the regents noted the im-
portance of closing the gap between 
UC faculty salaries and thoseat com-
parable institutions, saying they 
would try to make up the gap in two 
years, rather than three. 

Secondly, the regents said they

would push for no student fee in-
creases. 

Finally, the board pledged to pro-
vide additional funding for student 
outreach programs. 

In other board action: 
• Student Regent Ed Gomez's 

motion, SP-5, which would have 
amended the chancellor-appoint-
ment process to include student 
votes, was referred to President 

Atkinson. 
Accord ing to Falk, Atkinson 

stripped all chancellor search com-
mittee members of voting rights, 
and will instead ask the committee 
to reach a consensus. 

• Gomez's second motion, SP-7, 
which would have allowed use of 
mandatory student fees for limited 
lobbying under Smith vs. Regents, 
was defeated by the board.

A MISSING PIECE: 

GUARDIAN 
FEATURES 

THE EN'S 

Awareness of harassment and violence against 
women is finally in the forefront of UCSD's 

atmosphere and policies 

I n the wake of a recent UCSD"rape scare," women on campus speak of sex offenses with a more intensified fear than in previous years. This ap-
prehension is reflective of the rising 

rate of such crimes - between 1992 and 
1994, only one campus rape was reported 
to police annually. This year, after one 
reported rape was highly publicized, re-

ports of rapes on campus 
rose dramatically, 

In addition to a fear of 
being assaulted, many women 

also worry that the official sta-
tistics on rape, sexual harass-

ment and domestic violence are 
euphemistic IeP-resentationsof 

__ " true campus life. Because ~"," ..... _ ...., many women do not re-

unsafe - the UCSD campus really is, 
Astudy ofrapeandviolentcrimes against 

women conducted by Ms. magazine shows 
that only one out of every 10 women who 
were raped file a report with police. 

"[ believe that the figures on rape and 
sexual harassment on campus are severely 
underrepresented," said Rosalind Young, 
an employee with the UCSD Student Safety 
and Awareness Program (SSAP). "There 
are numerous reasons for this - including 
the tendency within society to place a lot of 
blame on the victim ... and the issue of 
trust." 

Such factual misrepresentations are per-
petuated by the majority of published sta-
tistics on crimes against women. These 
statistics usually exempt reported incidents 
of harassment or domestic violence, ac-
cording to Young. 

Last year, the UCSD office of Sexual

Harassment Prevention and Policy

sexual harassment involving cam-

cording to SHPP Director June 
Terpstra, 10 complaints warranted 
formal SHPP investigations. 
c......,.CIIMte 

Statistics and investigations aside, 
the status of women at UCSD is ulti-
mately determined by the "campus 
climate" and the prioritizing of 
women's issues. 

"Campus climate" - or institu-
tional atmosphere and environment 
- is addressed as a problematic issue 
in R"Oberta Hall's work "The Class-
room Climate: A Chilly One for 
Women?" adapted from a study con-
ducted by the Project on the Status 
and Education of Women. 

Hall cited a study which ' found 
"per.masive evidence that, in select-
ing and reacting to educational envi-
ronments, females tend more than 
males to be attuned to the personal 
supportiveness of these environ-
ments." 

There is no distinctive barometer 
of "campus climate" within the uni-
versity . However, advocates of 
women 's issues claim there are facts 
and figures which illustrate UCSD's 

lack of response to their requests: 
-UCSDwuthe last UCcampuslo 

fund a women's center. The center 
was approved last year, after 20 year.; 
of lobbying by students and faculty. 

• The women 's studies major at 
UCSD was established four year.; ago 
- decades behind Harvard, Duke 
and "several of the nation 's top uni-
ver.;ities," according to Terpstra. 

• Unlike other UC campuses, 
UCSD's SHPP office, which investi-
gates sexual-harassment policies, is 
not run in accordance with Title IX 
policies. (ritle IX of the educational 
amendments to the Federal Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 is the clause which 
prohibits sexual harassment in feder-
ally funded educational institutions.) 

"The environment at UCSD, in 
many ways, devalues an academic 
focus on gender - especially in in-
corporating a gendered per.;pective 
on different academic fields, such as 
psychology or history, " Terpstra said. 
W-' ...... 

UCSD's SSAP and SHPP offices 
speciftcally address issues such as 
sexual harassment, assault and bat-
tery. According 10 Young, these is-
sues incl ude cases of rape or domestic 
violence, as well as complaints of 
harassment among students, faculty 
and staff. 

Sexual-harassment cases can range 
from quid quo pro "sex-for-jobs" situ-
ations, in which the alleged harasser 
can influence conditions of employ-
ment or education, to "low-key" ac-

"An example uf harassment could 
be a group of building contractor.;

Terpstra.

After 20 year.; of lobbying and

staffed and funded by the administra-

receives funding exclusively from the 
AS. Council. 

According to WRC volunteer 
Tram Nguyen, the collectiye will be 
centralized, with a staff and perma-

Tritons Return to Earth NASTY: Uni's are terrible to behold as if it was created It a "taggers'" convention. Or perhaps, in an effort to raise still more revenue, the Rock-
ets held a fan "paint day," in which 
faithful Houston backer.; could pur-
chase their own water colors at the 
door before joining the fun in the 
arena. Sent off with a pat on the back 
and a plea to please "stay within the 
lines," these overzealous fans may 
have been allowed to put the finish-
ing touches on Houston's house of 
horrors.

After gelling the season off to 
a quick start on Nov. 4 by defeat-
ing four conference rivals, the 

.UCSD fencing 
crew arrived at an 
early season test on 
Saturday. 

Division I Cal 
State Long Beach 
and the Tritons con-
verged on the cam-
pus of Cal State Ful-

lerton to battle both the host Titans 
and each other. The results would 
be an indication of which team the 
rest of the conference would be 
aiming for in the remainder of the 
season. 

And the indications were that 
UCSD has some work to do before 
it can challenge for a conference 
title.

The Tritons were 1-3 on the day 
getting their only victory in the 
women's match against Fullerton. 

The men lost a tight match to 
Fullerton, 14-13, but were beaten 
more soundly by CSULB, 19-8. 

The most positive performance 
on the men's side came from the 
sabre division, where the Tritons 
defeated Fullerton, 6-3, and Long 
Beach,5-4. 

The men's foil team wu also 
evenly matched against its foes from 
up north, but wu able to pull out 
only one win, 6-3, over the Titans. 
The Niners got the best of UCSD's 
foiler.; by a 6-3 tally. 

"Both the foil and sabre teams 
were really evenly matched [against 
Fullerton and Long Beach]," Triton 
Head Coach Usa Posthumus said. 
"Many of the bouts were decided by 
just one touch. It was just a brawl in 
there."

"Our men's epee team 'will

team," Posthumus said. "This year, 
they will have an up hill battle, but 
they'll come out ahead." 

The women had a bit more 
success during the meet as they

Finally, and perhaps most aw-
fully, the defending champion 
Rockets have taken the courts this 
season with a disastrous mess of a 
uniform, which - it has been ru-
mored - was created in a freak 
accident at the local paint shop. 

Houston not only brought to 
tbe league its new jersey design, 
but a new floor as well. And please 
folks, if you haven't already seen 
it, avert your eyes so that you too 
will not have to suffer the night-
mares with which I have been 
plagued of late. 

This new slab of hardwood looks 

This may, on the other hand, give 
the Rockets a whole new form of 
home court advantage, when play-
ers on the opposing team lose sight 
of the ball amidst the brightly col-
ored tiles of the new floor. 

Whatever the cast may be, this 
trend of new uniforms and f100r.;-
obviously sparked by the NBA's 
pursuit of heightened merchandis-
ing revenues - is a plague upon the 
league; and to stop it, we must start 
at the beginning. 

So join me in pledging your sup-
port of the NASW, whose boycott 
will no doubt be starting any day 
now. The little guys thank you for 
your support.

Tritons Split Banana 
BAKED: UCSD's nine-man team fell to UC Santa Cruz and 
CSU Bakersfield; the women beat UCSC, but fen to CSUB 
By Dan Kratt 
Sports Editor 

This weekend in Triton swimming and 
diving brought a challenging dual meet with 
Division II CSU Bakersfield and fellow Di-
vision III dweller, UC Santa Cruz. The UCSD 
women narrowly missed a sweep of their two 
foes - settling for the split - while the 
shorthanded Triton men's team was 
beaten by both the Roadrunners and 
Banana Slugs. 

The UCSD men were going with a 
"skeleton," nine-man squad due to the 
absence of numerous swimmers for 
various, non-injury related, reasons; 
and despite being topped by both UCSC 
and CSUB, Triton Head Coach Doug 
Boyd saw no reason to despair. 

"We got hammered by Santa Cruz. But 
if we had everybody there, it probably 
would have been a different story," Boyd 
said. "We're focused in and swimming 
well, and when March rolls around, we 
should be in the top five in the country." 

UCSD did have a trio of performers on 
the men's side who caughtthecoach's eye. 
Senior Andy Hollywood continued to swim 
well for the Tritons, winning the 100- and 
200-yard backstroke races against Santa 
Cruz. 

Fellow senior and co-captain Kaley

missing a come-from-behind victory over 
the UCSC relay squad. 

finally, in the diving events, senior 
standout Adam Burgasser earned the top-
spot in both the one- and three-meter boards 
against the Banana Slugs, and in the one-

meter board versus the Roadrunners. 
The women, meanwhile, had their way 

with the UCSC team, 154-124, and lost to 
their Division II foe from Bakersfield by 
only 14 points, 126-112. The Tritons were 
simply outnumbered by the Roadrunners, 
and this cost them when they were forced to 
surrender 16 points in the 1000 freestyle 

because they didn't enter a competi-
tor. 

However, there were plenty of 
bright spots for the UCSD women. 
Freshmen Sarah Chu recorded a stel-
lar time of] :09.71 in the 100 breast-
stroke, which was very close to the 
NCAA qualifying cuI. 

Kelly Byrne, also a freshman, con-
tinued to impress with first-place finishes in 
the 200 ind ividual medley and the 200 breast, 
as well as a second place in the 100 butterfly. 

Junior Heather McPherson contributed 
with a quick 5:26.9 in the 500 freestyle, 
which was good enough for second. Mean-
while, the Tritons' co-captain, Carrie·Parker, 
continued to battle an ailing back as she 
captured second in the 200 backstroke and 
first in the 100 with a solid 1:01.6 mark. 

She was followed across the finish line by 
yet another solid freshmen performer, Kristi 
Jordan, who reached the wall in 1:04.1. 

The reputation of the UCSD diving squad 
was once again in good hands with Sheri 
Takeuchi, who grabbed first in both the one-
and three-meter boards. 

"We had a lot of events where we just 
didn' t have as many people," Boyd said. 
"[The other teams] just have a lot more 
depth, and [that's what you ~] in a dual 
meet."

put in two late goals, they 
could not overtake their

However, a team like the Falcons could 
only be held down for so long, and the high-
flyers came back strong in the second half. 

"I didn't like the third period," Harper 
said. "But once we got to nine [goals], I 
started to feci a little better." 

Indeed, the Falcons rattled off three 
straight scores in the period's first three min-
utes to make the score a rather tentative 8-5. 

De La Barra ignited his teammates and 
the crowd, though, when he picked up a 
rebound and netled it midway through the 
period for the Tritons' ninth goal. Soon after, 
Chris Proietti followed with the first of his

The Tritons WWPA Championship run 
almost ended prematurely in Saturday'ssemi-
final game against Claremont. UCSD barely 
edged the Stags, 10-9, in what was a see-saw 
affair. 

In fact, the lead continued to change 
hands until the end of the third period and 
the beginning of the fourth, when UCSD 
managed to string three consecutive goals 
together for a 10-7 advantage. The Tritons 
then withstood a late Stag charge to come 
away with the one-point victory. 

In that game, Nalu - the conference 
MVP - led UCSD with four scores, while 
Bollenbach added three. 

"The Claremont game was kind of a 
gut-check for us," said Giulianotti, who 
was later named to the WWPA's firstteam. 
"It helped us that we had a tough game 
against them." 

The Tritons' championship run began on

points, dispatched number-eight seed

NlNERS: UCSD 
struggled on the road 
Continued from pal' 15 
to the conference title with their first 
two outings. 

The well rounded squad was 
paced by a trio of fencers. Janet 
Wertz, -Suzanne Walters and 
Victoria Andrews all finished the 
day with 7-1 marks en route to a 13-
3 trouncing of Long Beach and a 
similarly dominant 14-2 demolition 
of FulIerton. 

"Our epee team is still number 
one and they will probably stay num-
ber one," Posthumus said. "They 
should win the conference." 

The foil team, on the other hand, 
struggled against their more experi -
enced opponents. The Titans topped 
the UCSD 11-5 while Long Beach 
gave up only one game to the Tri-
tons in a 15-1 victory. 

UCSD will take a break before 
resuming its season against these 
same teams in a dual meet on Febru-
ary 10.

Klinger. Bryan Leek and Neal 
Harderboth reduced their race times 
by 14 seconds. Leek finished right 
behind Johnson, at 25:46 and 71 st 
overall. Harder followed at 26:02 
and 89th place. 

"It was a very fast day out there," 
Triton Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
said. "We ran really tight together. 
We ran hard and aggressively, and 
competed well." 

"This was a really fast year [com-
pared to previous championships) . 
The guys that won ran as fast as 
[Division I runners] ," Castner said. 

The Tritons had many obstacles 
to overcome before and during this 
race. Their scheduled flight from 
San Diego had an unexpectedchange 
in itinerary and landed in Los Ange-
les. Consequently, the team was 
forced to take a red-eye trip to the 
mid-West. 

Furthermore, after flying for a 
major portion of the night, they 
landed in Chicago and slept at the 
airport while waiting for the com-
muterflightthat would take them to 
Wisconsin. In the end, the team left 
San Diego at 1 p.m. on Thursday 
and didn't arrive in Wisconsin until 
11:30 a.m. on Friday morning. 

"They accepted the situation and 
dealt with it extremely well," Van 
Arsdalesaid. "They didn't complain 
at all. It was a tough trip, and I'm 
really proud of the way the guys 
handled il. They really are champs." 

Another change for UCSD was 
running in the biting chill of 37-
degree weather. The cold cause.d a 
few blurred eyes and forced quick 
adjustments to the new climate. 

"[Many of the other runners] 
were more used to the weather than 
us, after running in it for the last two 
weeks [at Regionals]. We were kind 
of shocked," Leek said. 

"It was cold and I couldn't see," 
Castner said. "I was in my own little 
world and had trouble getting into 
the race." 

Despite all that was thrown in its 
way, the team persevered. 

"They didn't lay down; they 
didn't quit. They ran as hard as they 
could," Van Arsdale said, "They 
ran to their maximum ability on that 
day. I'm really pleased with them as 
a group." 

Leek summed it all up: "It was a 
good trip. It brought us all together. "

Occidental several times and even-
tually took a six-point advantage at 
halftime, 58-52. 

"We were pleased to be ahead 
at the half," Triton Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "Defensively, 
we were a step slow and gave up 
too many easy shots. Basically, 
that allowed them to stay in the 
game. " 

The Tritons controlled the con-
test for most of the second half by 
making the Tigers work for every 
point. Occidental was forced to 
play catch-up throughout the half, 
taking the lead only once, at 61-
60, on David Newhall'S jumper in 
the lane. 

UCSD guard Jason Jones quickly 
answered, however, with his sec-

advantage with four minutes re-
maining. 

Occidental, however,showed its 
experience by calmly chipping 
away at the lead. The Tigers' ef-
forts soon paid off, when they tied 
the game with 35 seconds left in 
regulation on a three-pointer by 
senior guard Hon Trieu. 

UCSD set up for a last-second 
shot, but could not get a good look 
at the basket and settled for the 
overtime period. 

After shooting a torrid 50 per-
cent from three-point land in the 
first half, UCSD couldn't keep pace 
with the blistering shooting per-
centage of Occidental. 

The Tigers shot 66 percent 
from behind the arc in the second 
half and finished at 60 percent for 
the game - including two huge 
threes in the opening minute of 
overtime to take an 
unsurmaountable lead. Occiden-
tal outscored UCSD, 14-8, in the 
extra period to register its fi rst 
win of the season.

force to reckon with for years to 
come, however, IS three of their 
five leading scorers were fresh-
men: Mike Wall (15 points,S re-
bounds), Mike Thimgan (12 
points, 5 rebounds) and Libby 
(11 points). 

The play of Libby was espe-
cially encouraging, as he ran the 
floor extremely well (no turnovers) 
and showed a lot of poise. Down by 
three points late in overtime, Libby 
gambled and came up with a huge 
steal and break away, but was 
whistled for a reach-in foul , which 
nullifyed the effort. 

Friday night at Redlands, UCSD 
rallied late to take a one point vic-
tory, 92-91, in its season opener. 
Down by five points late in the 
game, the Tritons scored IOstraight 
points - fueled by Thimgan 's 
seven straight free-throws in the 
remaining 2:00. Malt Aune led 
UCSD to the victory with 23 points, 
hitting eight of nine shots in the 
second half. 

"It \'las a real team effort, as far 
as having character and sticking 
together," Lanthier said, regarding 
the opening-night victory.

Ugly Threads 
InvadeNBA 

I submitted a proposal 
today to the National Associa-
tion of Silk Worms (NASW), 
who - in case you didn't 
know - have a rather 
powerful lobby in Washington. 
The basic premise of my 
suggestion was that the NASW 
should refuse to manufacture 
any more silk until several 
NBA teams, who have donned 
new uniforms this season, 
agree to shake the moth balls 
off their old threads and 
immediately begin to play in 
them once again.

CHAMPS: The Tritons crushed Air Force, 12-8, to win the WWPA title and a trip to the Final Four 

If you hadn't already 
noticed, a disturbing number 
of franchises have made 
drastic changes to their on-the-
court attire this season. 
Perhaps this fearful trend can 
be traced back to the Cleve-
land Cavaliers, who made one 
such change last season. 

Their pansy pastel 
uniforms - capable of 
striking awe into nothing 
larger than your garden-
variety bumble bee -
survived an entire season. Is 
it just me, or should there 
have been at least 101 
thousand letters on the desk 
of the Cav's president, 

deman~ing that those new-
age briefs be ripped from the 
lockers and used for kindling 
in the fire over which Art 
Modell should be roasted. 

Apparently, no such 
appeals to common sense were 
made, and the Cavaliers' 
uniforms survived to grace the 
team's members for another 
eason. Unfortunately for the 

viewing public, Cleveland 's 
front office - which obvi-
ously ha no more fashion 
sense than Ace Ventura - has 
prompted a wave of similar 
changes around the league. 

Newcomers Toronto and 
Vancouver both arrived with 
extremely marketable mascots 
arrayed across strikingly 
hideous uniforms. The 
Grizzlies may soon be the 
"titans of teal" with their 
garishly outlined new duds, 
while the Raptors' jerseys are 
dominated by a Jurassic

the youngsters, but forlorned

10.

Tritons Split 
First Two 
By Mike Stange 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball team fulfilled all 
promises of providing an entertaining up-tempo 
game Saturday night at RIMAe. The young 

Tritons kept pace with a more 
experienced Occidental squad 
through most of the contest, only 
to see the Tigers run away with it 
in overtime for the 111-105 vic-
tory. 

Junior forward Matt Aune led 
the Tritons with 27 points, 11 re-
bounds and 4 steals. Sophomore 

guard Mark Sebek added 16 points, including 
four 3-pointers to spark the UCSD offense. But 
on this night, it was not meant to be. 

La Barra accounted 
for the first score, 
netting a two-
pointer from the 10-
meter mark in the 
game ' s second 
minute. Moments 
later, Steve Crass, 
who was named to 
the WWPA's sec-
ond team, followed 
with a goal from the 
left wing - and the 
period ended with 
the Tritons surging 
to the 3-0 advan-
tage.
