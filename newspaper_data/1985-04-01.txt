Gardner supports axing remedial classes 
By JANE ROSENBERG, 5acramtnro Corrtspondtnr 

U NIVERSIIT OF CALIFORNIA President David Gardner endorsed eliminating remedial 
courses at UC during an Assembly 
subcomminee nearing on March 19. 

Responding to questions on 
affirmative action and new admission 
standards which go into eITect in 1986, 
Gardner said removing those courses 
could force high schools 10 bener 
prepare their students for college. 

"If you were 15-16 years old and

asked , "or taking it in college for credit, 
what would you do? Exactly what they 
have already done. 

"Instead of helping high schools 
reverse the trend , we have been helping 
promote the rrend ," he continued . "It is 
my view that we should phase out those 
remedial courses and t1y and help the 
high schools reinstate those (coUege 
preparatory) courses: 

Gardner estimated that four-year 
colleges increased their remedial 
oITerings 70% between 1975 and 1980 
because high school curriculums have 
"dirfused" over the past 25 years. 

·Students have come into coUeges less 
well prepared, and the University has 
had to accommodate this c~d set of 
circumstances," he said, 

Gardner's position contrasts with the 
views of some UC Student Body 
Presidents' Council members, who feel 
remedial courses in english and math 
are necessa ry for the success of 
affirmative action retention programs, 

During a 2ln-hour session with the 
SBPC March 8 in San Francisco, 
Gardner was continually asked about 
these prograrns and why remedial 
courses oITer no credit at uc. 

Gardner also encountered criticism 
on affirmative action from the Assembly 
Ways and Means education 
subcomminee members, who noted that 
including Asian students in affinnative 
action records improves UC's actual 
perfonnance. 

"Realistically, if you did not have all 
the very bright Asians in this state , your 
minority perfonnance would not be all

Isenberg (D-Sacramemo). 

A recent CaUfornia Postsecondary 
Education Commission repon showed 
that Asian students have the highest 
eligibility rate ror admission into UC in 
the state at 26%. 60% of those students 
actually enrolled at UC in the 1983-84 
year. 

Black students have the lowest rate-
3.6% in 1983-84, down from 5% in

Gardner called Isenberg's assessment 
"perfectly true" and he acknowledged 
one subcommittee member's complaint 

that a UC program targeting promising 
minoriry junior high school students 
may cause problems ror other seCtors of 
higher education. 

"We've been reaching into the junior 
highs, trying to identify young people ,

Fee hike dies in Assentbly 
By JANE ROSENBERG, Sacramenro Correspondent 

T HE THREAT OF A student ree increase next year fizzled March 12 when a key Assembly 
subcomm ittee rejected a 
recommendation to raise undergraduate 
fees 7,3% and graduate fees 2.4%. 

The Assembly Ways and Means 
subcommittee on education voted 4-1, 
with Republican Tom McClintock of 
Thousand Oaks dissenting, against the 
Legislative Analyst's suggestion to 
implement a new fonnula for seui ng 
fees one year early. 

The fonnula, now moving through the 
Legislature in the ronn of Senate Bill 
195, would increase rees both at the 
University or Calirornia and the 

California State Universiry based on a 
three-year rolling average of increased 
state aid to higher education, 

The bill, authored by Sen. Ken Maddy 
(R-Fresno), passed its first legislative 
hurdle March 13 when the Senate 
Education Committee unanimously 
ap proved it. The bill would go into 
eITect in the 1986-87 school year. 

The Assembly action came two weeks 
after another Senate subcommittee, two 
members of which are co-authors of the 
maddy bill , went along with Gov. George 
Deukmejian's plans to maintain rees at 
current levels, ignoring the Legislative 
Analyst.

Our institutions of suicide 
Very re entlr a frie nd informed me that the various ideologies of 

[e\'en RobertS were hopelessly romantic and misgiven. The very idea of 
attriburll1g so ial worth to an act that is so intrinsically tragic, self-
erving and malicious, she said, IS gro sly absurd. l 0 one is better off. 

the nuclear arms race is stm perpetuating at a rapid rate, and the clo e 
frIends, ramI!) and eyewitnc es to the event are left permanently 
s arred ~1odem oClet}' only pJ[Jes those \\ ho believc that martyrdom is 
a noble act. she reasoned ; It IS viewed as a gutless, c wardl) act of the 

mo~t 1I1slgmfi 'ant consequence Just take a look around )'ou, she 
pb1ded with me; thc real rca 'nons to most ~ulcldes are somber, 
III l) [0 se , paSSI\'c even! People do not pledge themselves to action when 
one choo es to take himself away from h\'ing, where all the conceivable 
opllons for connnued affc tation on souet)' lie . Your belief, she 
whlspereJ 111 a scoldmg manner, that teven Roberts ' SUicide was the 
ultimate act l)f human sacrifice IS completely Illogical. On top of that, II 

i~ ~dr leginmdng and insen Itive. If anythll1g, modern suiCide is the 
ultimate act of self-deceptlon, concluded my friend 

:\ few Jays after thiS onver ation the second suiCIde of ue D's 
\\ mter of di content occurred. Thi time, like every other, the 
circumstances surrounding the VICI/Ill'S death were extremely different, 
almost more p,llnful considering the relativity of her plight in hght of 
our l)Wn as students' a young woman who was given very little leeway 
by the 1I1StItUtll)J1 she \\'a attending (Ue Ir"me Medical School). ThiS 
student, lucidl) aware of her identity prohlems, de ided m a flash that 
her cries would grow louder and louder as life progressed, and then 
leapt to her death of[ the always allunng Tioga Hall. 

Her death shocked those who knew her and those who were vaguely 
av-are that mlsel") expands even dunng finals week. 

o I paced around m) hvmg room wondering who would take 
responsibiltty for her eternal frustration with unsympathetic institutions 
like the unJverslty. I was sure that "the deepest sympathies" of UCI were 
extended to her famIly. Psychological counseling is always available, they 
would extoll to their detractors. 

I gradually forgot about the incident for the rest of finals week and 
into the first few days of vacation . Since I did not know her personally, 
and her reason for jumping did not play up to my "romanti " notions of 
why one would pubhcly make an example of herself, I decided merely to 

emotionalize this suicide as pure tragedy, and nothing more. 
Well then, just a few days later in our life of vicious cycles, my phone 

began to shrill ominously (as it always will when death stalks). A friend 
frantically informed me that someone very close to me had taken a gun 
to his head and \\'ished the woeful world a very harsh good night. We 
spoke numbly for a few moments about why, then sounded a few tears 
for anl)ther strong friend, hi tricken girlfriend who apparently 
di covered his remains in their Philadelphia apartment. 

Then he told when it happened . Then I realized it was the very same 
I1Ight that the VISitor to Tioga onduded that she had taken enough. 
And I rememhered the pretentious way in which I had categori;:ed her 
death as Just another irrevocable tragedy. And it hurt. 

It hurt hecau e not onl), \\'.lS It the first time that someone close to me 
had died, but because the overlymg reasons given [or my fnend's 
Uleide are identical to those given for the In'1I1e student's suicide: an 

ovenvhelming amount of pressure stemmi ng from a volatile academic 
life , a depressed working environment, the elusive struggle for success 
and, of course, SOCiety'S misconception of their real wants and deSires. 

My reaction, and a standard one at that, is :l heavy, sn::trling anger at 
those inst itutions, rituals and practices that provoke our youth to end 
their morhld exhaustion with lire's little "reali ties." Man 's evolving 
answers to the causes of suicide are bei ng developed within fields such 
as psychology. It is so human, so cunningly fallible for people to develop 
hypotheses that Stitt grant that the system from which deathly maladies 
arise IS not only worth sustaining, but is viable enough so that it is 
always the individual who is rejecting society as a whole, not the 
"lenient" society who crushes their will to live. lr we must name a pe-rperr ... tor 111 these twO lI1stances, it would be our 
apathetic selves when we fail to legislate for a fundamental change 
within our disgusting over-competitive universities. For it is no longer 
students who ar~ in dire need of behavior modification, It is the 
univerSi ty structure which eliminates the "weak" at random. 

Must it be death, must it always be a series of heart-wrenching 
occurrences that wake us from our convalescent sleep? Are there none 
of us left who believe that Social Darwinism, or survival of the fittest, is 
a theoretical ex use for man 's failure to structurally implement non-
predatory institutions? -MJC

I am writing c.:oncemmg the young 
woman who commmed SUICide of! of

from UCSD but did live In La Jolla. I 
was witness to the aftermath as were Ihe 
people pressed up against the Window 
of MUir cafeteria where I was working at 
the time. 

ThIS is how I am dealing \\ Ith the 
thoughts I am experienCing, by sharing 
them with others rather than keeping 

them bottled Up inSide. The role she 
created for us as witnesses IS one we 
have to deal With. She was gifted 
intellectually, but Ihat doesn't mean she 
was gifted emotionally. Since thai time I 
have expt'rienced headaches and other 
sl ress reactions, such as anger. 
Institutions of soclery pllt vast amounts 
of pressure on us to perform 
accordingly When we don't, we are 
often labelled as allures 

[here are so man}' people here who 
would have helped her. So don 't keep

Murder by decree 
By PETER QUERelA 

Murder by decree is back in style. Twenty years ago 
a Gallup poll found that only 45% of Americans 
favored capital punishment. An Associate Press poll 
learned that , today, an unprecedented 84% of us 
support state-mandated killing. But, in keeping with 
that good old traditional conservative spirit of 
discrimination and bigotry, which is presently 
sweeRing the nalion , more than half the respondents 
said they still favored the death penalty even though 
they believed it was invoked unfairly from one case to. 
another. 

"It's a country without much of a social conscience 
right now," says Houston Attorney Jack Ackerman. In 
agreement is Hugo Adam Hedau, author of The Death 
Penalty In America, who says, "At this moment, the 
death penalty is the consummate symbol of the 
nation<ll mood. Thai mood: he says. "is authoritarian." 

So far this "New Wave" baroarism has resulted in 35 
men and one woman being put to death since Gary 
Gilmore was executed by firing sql4ld in 1977. In 1984 
alone 21 people were extemlinated. "The tumbrels are 
rolling:' declares Henry Sehwarzchild , director of the 
capi tal punishment project for the American Civil 
Liberties Union. No longer will executions be 
dominated by southern sta tes In the Bible belt , where , 
he says, the courts rouunely "come down with a 
special kind of feroci ty on people who seem to viola te 
the nonns of sociery." The South's penchant for 
imposing the most severe punishment is poised to 
spread like wildfire a ros the nation , where 
Schwarzchild estimates between 50 to 60 executions 
\\111 be carried out in 1985. 

Thllty-three statc~ currently embrace the ultimate 
punishment. Today nearly 1,500 indiVIduals are 
Interned dmong the '50 death rows across Amcrica. 
CalifornlJ's death li st numbers IN, third behind Texas 
wllh 185 and F10ndJ with 123. To exterminate so 
man) people efficlentl), would cntaJl a blooclbath , says 
Walt Espy of the University of Alabama Capital 
Punishment Project. "If we were to exec llt~ one m,\I1 a 
day, seven days J week, it would take more than three 
years to execute evel)'one who is \VJiting on death 
row," he 5.lys. And because of Ihe obsessions of Gov. 
George Deukmejian, "Big Bad John" Duffy. sheriff of 
an Diego County and such right wmg Vigilante 

organizations as "victims for Coun Reform," who are 
hell-bem on dumping capital punishment opponent 
Rose Bird , chief justice of the California Supreme 
COllrt, II is only a matter of time before the cyanide 
tablets resume falling once more. 

Extensive research by II criminologIsts at the 
Univers ll)' of Florida into 3,859 executions between 
1930 to 1967, mcludlng the nearly 2,000 carried out 
dunng the sadistic ye'lrs of the Grear Depression-
when ell.te rmmmions peaked at 200 a year-found "no 
credlhlr SCienti fic resea rch" whatsoever shOWing a 
corrcIJ tion between an increase of executions and ,I 
decrease In the crime rate. UCSD SOCIOlogist David 
Phillips and John Hensley, a graduate student there , 
studied daily homiCIde mtes in respect to whether 
there \V,\S a drop In the murder rate when the harshest 
pUnishment was meted out as compared to more 
lenient sentences lin posed on defendems convicted of 
Similar crimes. Phillips' study concluded: "When you 
compare the fluctuation of homiCides after life 

~ntences with fluctuation of homicides after death 
sentences and executions, you find homicides do not 
drop significantly more after a har;h form of 
punishment than after J mild form of punishment." On 
the d,IY an execution is widely puhliCized, the nation 's 
homICide rate falls an anemiC .24%. 

Yet, ht'tween 1980 ,md 1983 Americ,\'s murder rate 

fell from 23,044 to 19,308, a drop of 3,636. In 1984. 
murders were down by an additional 5% over 1983. 
However, Richard Brody of the NAACP's capital 
punishment project says all this "is mainly conjecture . 
The homicide r.ltes are dropping (ber;ause) there are 
fewer people in Iheir 20s and 30s, thus: the crime rate 
goes down. It has absolutely nothing to do with 
executions." Indeed Hedau says most experts predicted 
today's decreasing crime rate 10 years ago, based on 
the inevitable decline of crime-prone young adults, 
"and not the death penalty," he says. 

In California, where no inmate has been executed 
for 22 years the murder rate has plummeted 22.5% 
since 1980, reports Attorney General John Van de 
Kamp. This despite the fact that California's 
population has multiplied by well over five million 
during thiS period . 

Bedau's study found that since 1900 there have 
been, on average, three cases a yea r "in which an 
entirely innocent person was convicted of murder, 
with dozens of those persons sentenced to death ."

man , was released with apologies, from the San Diego 
County Jail after waiting 10 months for his trial for 
allegedly killing a mother and her son in tht'ir San 
Diego home in 1979. The District Attorney was 
prep.'Iring to prosecute Massingale based on statements 
"only the killer" could have known , when by chance 
the apparent real perpetrator was finally linked to the 
crime. 'They could've very well taken my life , killed me 
and buried me, an innocent man," said MaSSingale . 
'That's what's wrong with the world today," he said . 
"' Instead of people trying to help somebody, they all 
wam to go the opposite way." 

In 1972, the US Supreme Coun in Furman vs. 
Georgia , ruled that the death penalty, as applied under 
many state stalutes, was impose.;! so arbitrarily and 
capriCiously that it constituted "cruel and unusual 
punishment." as stated in the Eighth Ammendment. 

But in 1976, this same coun said that because 
capital punishment was accepted by such a "large 
proportion of American socIety" it is no longer cruel 
and unusual pUnishment after all. However, those who

f irst off, why bring the word "art" 
Itself In to this? And secondly, your 
perverse sense of "powe r" has been 
proven to us through your "coumgeous" 
graffi ti. These self righteous attitudes of 
yours show us nothing but clues to your 
ignorance and immaturity. 

I wonder how people like you even 
made it to college? I consider the level 
of Intellect to be fairly high at this 
university. but you folks definitely give 
us an example of those who make those 
grading curve JUst a little bit easier. 
What you have done may be erased 
after a while . but your attitudes 
obviously cannot. If you have a gripe to 
share in the future , or feel unhappy 
about something, please choose some 
other means of dealing with it rather 
than involving thousands of inno ent 
Victims with your abuse and

"I don't think it's fair for members of 

a jury to be asked to impose upon 
another human being the fate that 
awaits a condemned prisoner without 
knowing what it IS Ihat they are going 
to be subjecting that OIher human being 
to ." A1schuler says. "I think the jury ha 
a right to know." 

Ex-warden Wilson is haunted by the 
memories of witneSSing 194 men and 
women PUI to death during his tenure 
at San Quentin. He Vividly recalls the 
prisoner being strapped to a metal chair 
and waiting for the silent signal to fill 
the pits with W"dter spiked with sulfuric 
acid, when the guard pulled a lever 
whIch dropped a cheesecloth sack full 
of cyanide pellets into the lethal 
concoction. and how the prisoner's 
lungs would slowly fill with the deadly 
gasses. Death , hc recalls, was 
agonizingly slow. 

On Dccember 12. 1984, the State of 
Georgia attempted to e1ec tTOC Ule Alpha 
Stephens with a lethal dose of 2,080 
volts of electricity. Conscious during the 
painful twO minutes the juice was on, 
and for an additional eight minutes after 
it was turned off. the young black man 
instinctively fought for his life. The only 
response from his executioners was (Q 

zap him with another 2,OOO-plus volts 
until it appeared he had finally 
succumbed. With a shrug. one prison 
spokesman declared. "from everything 
we can gather, it went like it's supposed 
to. Maybe different people hav different 
physical makeups?" 

Today, instead of holding solemn 
candlelight vigil and proceSSIOns, the 
"m thing" is to throw "necktie parties" 
outside the penitentiary walls, while the 
state does "it's thing" inside. When 
Thomas Andy Barefoot was executed on 
October 30. a large polrtlcal group of 
jovial conservative revelers from the 
University of Texas celebrated the event 
by whooping, howling and carousi ng. 
much like some people do at a New 
Year's Eve party. The grand finale came 
at the moment Barefoot was executed. 

Violence is rapidly becoming an 
acceptable mode of behavior in America. 
Murder, the most extreme fonn of 
violence, is not a tOpic conducive to " 
rationalization. Whether it is the 
individual or the coUective state that is 
preCipitating the ul timate violent act, it 
still amounts to killing a human being. 
And that, in every sense. defines "cruel 
and unusual punishment," as forbidden 
in the Eighth Ammendment of our 
Constitution.

Cover story 

Earthquake lab to shake up UCSD engineers 
By LlLYS McCOY & SEAN WAGSTAFF 

reaction-strong wall will be 20 feet 
shoner and not as strong. This, says 
Seible , IS due to the fact that Japan's 
research effortS are funded by the 
government and their employees are 
hired by the govemment. 

T HEY STOOD THERE lAUGHING and the walls came down . But they're not laughing anymore . 
Some time next year. UCSD will begin 

to experience wall -shaking earthquakes 
on a regular basis. The manmade quakes 
will take place in a specially constructed 
facility being built as part of a package 
deal that includes the Magnetic 
Recording Research Center. 

The first faci lity of its kind outside of 
Japan, the earthquake tcsting lab could 
bring improvements to construction 
methods for buildings which could 
significantly reduce the loss of li fe and 
property in the event of a large quake, 
particularly in high-risk areas such as 
the Weste rn Uni ted States. According to 
federal government reports. a large 
earthquake could kill some 20.000 
people in Southern California , 
depending on the time of day, the Los 
Angeles Times reponed. 

According to Dr. Frieder Seible. a 
professor of engineering at UCSD who 
has played an important part in the 
design of the project and the research 
lab itself. the key element to the testi ng 
lab will be an l8-foot-thick, 50-fOOl-high 
concrete reaction wall . Engineers intend 
to eventuaUy construct a five-story 
building next to the wall. By placing 
computer·controlled hydraulic battering 
rams between the wall and the building. 
they will be able to imitate earthquake-
type forces and study their effects on 
the building. he said . 

"Hydraulic actuators will be placed 
. between the wall and tlie test buildi ngs. 
The acuators will then push the building

in the desired fashion ... You can imput 
through a computer dynamic 
displacements which are calculated from 
actual earthquake records." 

Because of the massive size of th e 
wall . it will not move during the tests. 

Previous earthquake rcsearch in the 
United States has been donr on various 
components of construction. such as 
walls , noors, joints. etc ., using various 
small-scale machi ne-applied forces. At 
UC Berkeley, small-scale buildings are 

"When you scale down the buildrng 
too much ," Seible said , ·you have to 
scale down the aggregate stew, and you 
gel co mpletely different material 
properties." Therefore. the results are 
not as reillistic as those that an actual 
buddrng would Yield. 

This will he the first lab 10 the S in 
which computer Simulations to 
detennine whether a building can 
survive an earthquake can be physically 
tested . The $2 million facility is being 

'The dIfference in Japan is that all 
these facilities are government facilities, 
they're not university facilities .. . and , 
therefore, there is much more available." 

Seible confirms, however, that "this 
does not necessarily mean that we 
cannot do all that we want with our 
walL" 

The key element to the testing lab will be an 18-joot-
thick, 50-joot-high concrete reaction wall. 

According to Seible. the testing will be 
conducted in stages that could stretch 
over many years. Researchers will begin 
experimentation on the first story of the 
building, will then replace that stru ture 
with a two-story construction, and will 
continue like this until they reach their 
goal of five stOries. placed on an aptly named shaking tablt: 

which simulates eanhquake ground 
movement. 

"The shaking tables give you an idea 
about the overall structural behavior as 
far as you can extrapolate from the 
model, but this does not give you any 
ideas about the actual damage failure in 
details like in the joints. columns. 
beams, noors. walls. and things like this, 
because in a scaled-down model you 
have completely different material 
properties than you would III a 
building," Seible said. 

Cenain materials. concrete and brick 
in particular, can not be accurately 
tested in scaled-down models. Concrete 
consists of sand and gravel mixed with 
cement, and there is difficulty with 
usin,g scaled-down rocks and sand.

funded jOintly by the ational Science 
Foundation (NSF) and UCSD. with the 
NSF footing about 90% of the bill. 
Because the building is being built as a 
part of a package deal wirh the MRRC. 
said Seible: it will COSt far less than if it 
had been built alone. If constructed 
from scratch, the buildrng would cost 
closer to $10 million. 

Previously, the only testing facility for 
full-sized buildings was in Japan . where 
a joint US-Japan program has already 
tested buildings of steel and reinforced 
concrete. A test center was needed in 
the US because building materials and 
construction pra tices vaty from place to 
pia e, particularly with concrete and 
other forms of masonry. 

According to Seible, our facility will be 
smaller than Japan 's. SpeCifically. the 

"We will stan out testing the first 
story of the building before we go up to 
the real building. just to fine tune our 
testing procedure," he said . 

The lab will also house testing 
projects other than those on buildings. 
According to Seible. only one other type 
of experiment. on the effects of 
earthquakes on bridges, is scheduled fo r 
the facility so far. Seible will head the 
research conducted on these structures. 

"You build the bridges and bridge 
components in the lab ," he explained. 
"and then you test them under 
simulated traffic loading (during 
earthquakes) ... to see what kind of 
safety factors are involved ."

eihle dId not say thm these studIes 
would YIeld the exact effects of an 
earthquake on a stru ture, but he did 
say that the results from this kind of 
realisti testing could at least gIve some 
inSIght into the way building can be 
constructed In order to lessen the 
degree of damage in earthquakes. 

"We won't know what the neXI 
eJrthquake will be hke. what magnIlude , 
or Intensity ... but we WIll know how a 
struClure will behave under 'failure loads' 
and where Ihe potentl,.1 failure poims 
are ," he 5<lid. 

elble prediLts that inform.mon 
gathered from the expenmcms could 
evcmually affect some of the W.iys in 
which buildings are constru ted, 
through L" 1.' vanous codes and 
regulations imposed on the construction 
industry , by giving builders and 
planners a better "analyucal model" from 
which to work. 

Originally the center was planned to 
test only full-scale parts of buildlllgs, but 
becausc of the low cost and the gram 
from the NSF, it was decided LO build a 
facility to test emire structures, 

The research lab, which will rest 
directly east of the MRRC, should be 
completed by January 1986, Selble said. 
This date is later than expeCLed because 
the reaction-strong wall was, according 
to Sclble, not included in the origlllal 
plan 

"The original structure had baSICally 
rhe same 'foot-print' as rhe stru IUrc that 
we have right now, but we did not have 
this reaction-strong wall III the lab and 
the whole lab was about 20 feet ~horter 
th<ln It is right now Becausc of this 50-
fOOl reaction-strong w<lli that we have 
now, we had to raise the roof," 

The eanhquak(' wall wtll form the end 
of a 50-foot-wide, 120-foot-long, 64-
foot -high bUilding. The floor will be 
raised eight feet off the ground to aliow

Fee increase 
< CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3 < 

The Legislative Analyst began pushing 
fo r a fee increase with the release of its 
annual report February 27 in the hopes 
that it would save the state $22 million. 

The formula , if in place for the next 
school year, would have resulted in a 
$91 hike to undergraduates and a $3 1 
hike to graduates at UC, and a $27 
increase at CSU, according to the 
Analyst's report. 

Undergraduate fees at UC would have 
increases more than graduate fees so the 
current $70 difference between them-
known as the graduate fee dilTerential-
would have been eliminated. 

But UC and Cal State students and 
admlllistrators who worked with the 
Legislative Analyst last year In 
negotiating the Maddy formula quickly 
rejected plans for raising fees next faU , 
even labeling the suggestion a breach of 
faith . 

"We worked very hard on this fee 
policy. There was a tremendous spirit of 
compromise," UC budger Director Lany 
Hershman testified March 12. "One of 
the key features was that there would be 
10 months notice for aU fee increases. 
To break faith with the policy doesn't 
scem appropriate." 

Stewan MarshJll of the Legislative 
Analyst'S office argued , however, that 
students were already "on notice" last 
fall that a new formula might result in 
higher fees next year. 

"We don't have any disagreement on 
the policy." he said . "We only disagree 
on when to implement it." 

Legislators qUickly sided with antl-
hike forces , but were still critical of 
some of the formula's features . 

Assemblyman Bill Leonard, (R-
Redlands) rCiteraced a pOSition 
forwarded hy the Legislative Analyst 
during the negotiations on the fee 
policy thal graduates should pay higher 
tees, especially students in profeSSional 
schools studYlllg III high -paying fields. ~

$1.6 billion In UC investments 

Gardner balks at South Africa ties Rentedial < CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3 ;;: 
By JANE ~OSENBERG, SacmmenlO Correspondent 

U NIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA President David Gardner, saying he wasn 't "free to speak," refused 
to state his position on divestment 
March 8 despite pressure from student 
leaders to do so. 

"If I say I'm for divestment or if I'm 
opposed to divestment, you know what 
the headltne will be tomorrow," Gardner 
told the UC Student Body Presidents' 
Council. "It will Influence everything 
that happens between now and June ." 

Gardner was referring to a report on 
three options for divesting the $1.6 
billion UC has invested in companies 
doing business in South Africa the 
Regents will conside r at their June 
meeting. 

Gardner also told SBPC he is waiting 
for the Treasurer's report, the first study 
of the UC investments since 1978, 
before he makes up his mind and that 
he may be open to a new method of 
calculating UC's financial involvement 
with the apartheid regime . 

Currently, UC estimates that only $ 16 
to $17 million of the $1.6 billion 
invested in com panies doing business 
in South Africa has "direct involvement" 
in the nation because those companies 
have less than l % of their funds in 
South Africa themselves. 

"I'm nor saying we're going LO look at 
il that way," Gardner said when UC 
Berkeley Graduate Representative 
Howdrd Pinderhughes complained that 
UC IS the only institution with South 
African holdings to calculate its 
investments that way. 

Al though Gardner wouldn't respond 
to queries on his own views, he rejected 
a request from I3erkeley students to hold 
a public hearing and fll'}iSh the report a 
month early 

Student Regent Fred Gallles, who 
lIlitialiy pro)Josed the repon. pushed for 
an early deadline but sculcd for June to 
win Gardner's support. Berkeley 
graduates charged that Gardner was 
trying to avoid angry student opinion by 
meeting at the secluded Santa Cruz 
campus in June after finals instead of in 
May at the Berkeley campus. 

"It seemed to me what studies you 
may have had can be shared as easily in 
writing as they can be in a public 
hearing," Gardner said of the request 
outhned in a letter from the Berkeley 
Graduate Assembly and the ASUC 
Senate . 

He also reminded SBPC Ihat the 
Treasurer origi nally wanted to complete 
the report in July-a month after 
Gaines' term will expire-and noted the 
I3erkeley demands "assume that only 
Berkeley students are interested ." 

Gardner was also closed-mouthed on 
whether UC should sever ties with the 
two weapons labs, but he did say the 
Regents should vote on the issue and 
that he would invite outside input. 

"It would be unwise to wait until the 
day the Regents VOle on this to receive 
those views," Gardner said , but added 
UC may "receive the opinions of people 
who want to be heard , nor only people 
we want to hear from." 

After the 21,1l hour meeting, Gardner 

couldn't specify whom UC may consult , 
but said those who participated in past 
studies of the labs may be sought out. 

BUI he backed away from proposals 
for more studies of the labor.ltories, 
sayi ng, "I think everyone III the world 
has been studYlIlg it. 1 don't think a 
study as such (is needed). I think the 
Issues III connection with that matter 
are quite well understood." 

Gardner also discounted rer0rtS that 
debate on the labs was cut of at the laSt 
Regent's meeting at UCLA "To suggest it 
was stifled or cut off suggests a 
misunderstanding of how the board 
handles its business," he said. 

Although the federal contracts 
governing the labs don't expire until 
1987, the Regents must give the federal 
government twO yea rs nor ice tf they 
intend to sever the ties. A vore isn't 
necessary, Gardner said , but added: "My 
own view is that we should act anyway 
so there IS no ambiguity." 

Discussion on divestment and 
weapons labs began and ended SBPC's 
firs t meeting this year with Gardner, but 
the bulk of the exchange centered on 
affirmative ac tion, SBPC's top priomy 
this year. 

Berkeley and UCLA representatives 
continually challenged Gardner on the 
issue, Citi ng a lack of retention 
programs, the fact remedial courses offer 
no credit and the allocation of funds for 
white female graduate students instead 
of other under-represented millorities at 
some,campus.

testimony before the group of legislators 
in the Assembly to review UCs $1.6 
billion budget on the Legislative 
Analyst'S recommendations nOt to fund 
$1.5 million wonh of research projects. 

Referring to a suggestion that the 
Regents' OppOrtunity Fund finance a $1 
mtllion supercomputer project and a 
$500,000 study on a new panicle 
accelerator, Gardner said: "We strongly 
believe tha,l state funds are the proper 
sources of monies to suppOrt these 
initiarives. The research IS expected to 
yield direct and highly heneficial 
outcomes for the state's general 
economy." 

The subcommittee voted agai nst the 
Analyst'S suggeslions on the UC San 
Diego supercomputing lab-one of four 
sites chosen for supercomputers by the 
National Science Foundation-and the 
"superconducting supercollider," an 
underground paritc\e accelerator With a 
100-mile circumference. 

Isenberg pressed UC Vice President 
for Academic Affairs William Frazer on 
whether UC would dip into the 
Opportunity Fund , monies genera ted 
from overhead on federal research 
projects-for the supercollider study or 
supercomputers. 

Frazer told Isenberg UC would have 
to "scale back" the supercomruter 
project without state funds , i the 

ational Science Foundation would 
permit it. 

Isenberg, who voted against the $1 
million allocation, also asked the 
Analyst's office for a ten-year history on 
the opponunity fund, with more than 
$40 million and apprOXimately $3 
million in reserve. (i:J

-The commit[ment is there ," 
responded Gardner. who then outlined 
his trouble defending UC's of ten-
criticized affirma tive a tion efforts to 
groups on both sides of the debate . 

"If you t1'llnk it's ea y to defend ... it's 
not. I defend it everywhere all over the 
sta te . I get parems of students with 3.6 
and 3.7 (grade pOint averJges) sa)'lng. 
'Why are you admllllng 3.0s?"· 

At the same time. UC received only 
$500.000 from the sta te for graduate 
and professional students this year. 

Gard ner said . The university has 
matched those funds. 

"We've been riticized for only havi ng 
$1 million. but that's $1 million more 
than we had the year before ," Gardner 
sa id . 

He added that the new fee policy 
established a formula for raising fees that 
Wllliessen his "dis rei ion" to ask the state 
to ~elp finance affirmative a tion by 
"buying out" the educallon fee , which 
funds financial aid and affirmative 
ac tion programs. 

Gard ner asked Gov. George 
DeukmeJlan for a $17 million buy-out 
for the current year. but DeukmeJian 
reJe ted the request and decided to 
reduce fees $70. For the upcoming fi cal 
year, UC asked for 450.000 in support 
services for minority students which 
\\'35 also rejected by the governor.

Gardner said . 
In a separate interview. Gardner said 

he isn't espe ially concerned about 
affirmative action funding. "My own 
view is that it is going to have to shake 
out a bit because we're changing the 
ground rules. And I think it's probably 
necessaty for it to shake out before we 
are in a position 10 know best how 10 
proceed under the circumstances: he 
said . 

Gard ner also told SBPC its request for 
a systemwide affirmative a tion office 
which would consolidate the 
re ruitment effortS now divid ed among 
twO vice preSidents would be "an 
unwise arrangement." 

A se parate offIce would take 
re rullmenl duties away from senior vice 
preSidents normaUy in charge of them 
and "isolale" respons ibili ty for 

affirmative action. -It was very 
deliberate ," he said of his decision nOl 
to. create a separate olTice. 

SBPC did win a promise from 
Gardner that he would consult with th~ 
chancellors on student wages, which 
have been decreased at some campuses 
since 1981 . when Regems eliminated 
the .systemwide minimum wage. 

"Why did we do that?" Gardner asked 
his staff when SBPC complai ned wages 
were cut at UC Davis without 
explanation. But Gardner reiterated 
systemWIde's opposition to student 
unions. 

"There's a difference hetween student 
input on fees and student input on 
wages. That's the difference between 
collective bargaini.ng and none," he said . 
"I think you know our position on 
that." ~

"There WJs J lime when sClc ncc-ficllon was not

Pygmalra's openmg pronoun 'ement 

"R,Hher than rf) [0 IUustrate sCle n e-ftctlon Wi th

"My age nt IOfo rms me that the author, ~ ~arvard

Ovid, inSists I use the charcoal from her canister to 
create a hkene s of Galatea, the main character of her 
story, MetamorphoSIS oj a Maid. I shall oblige her as a 
fellow artIst: 

Pygmalia removed her boots, lifted herself onto the 
table and began nexing her fingers . "The sound of an 
artist scratching her fingers on paper IS not very 
entenaining. Therefore . my sister Kim will read 
selected passages from MetamorphoSIS oj a MaId while I 
work." From the wings, a younger versIOn of Pygmaha 
appeared on stage. "I will hold my co~mentanes on 
the anistic pro ess to a mll1lmum. Let s begin by 
lett ing Kim's voice guide us on a journey of another 
world ,"

By Chnstine Pi san-Ovid 

"Wahhh l " 
My newborn ister's voice pierced the pillars 

of flame nsing Into the I1Ight sky above our 
burning cabin. My hean tightened 10 Galatea's 
cries a my trembling hands passed the water 
bucket to the next viUager in our attempt to douse 
the inferno. The villagers of Vosges could not 
stop to re ue my sister because the fury raging in 
our household threaten~d to spread to their 
peaceful homes. When the darkness returned I 
stood blackened hands at my slde,stanngatthe 
ashes' that were once my home and family. 

"Wahhh l " 
Galatea? Digging through the ashes I found 

her In the food pit swaddled In wet towels. The 
Villagers called It "the Miracle of the Maid ." It wa s 
to be her firs t trial by fire , 

* * * Kiln paused. Pygmalia returned from a mlllce-like 
state . PullIng back the cover of h.er drawi~g pad she 
said , "I draw with my fingers, uSing the 011 In my 
hands as a bonding agent between myself, the charcoal 
and the paper. Wllh the e hands I draw away the 
novel's cover shroud to reveal the people wlthrn Please 
continue Kim " 

* * * The heat of the heanh raged red 111 Galatea's 
dark eyes. Her wise wide-set elderly eyes stared 
with fascmation and fear at the [lames that were 
now as common in our lives as forests of our 
planet once were before the rnvaslon of the 
Bludace warnors from the sky. The nostri ls of 
her long nJrrow nose n.tr~u wlue to tht' m,t1ocillu r

charred world. Her resolute full-lipped mouth 
and handsome herione chin drew one' eye to 
her ..IS she spoke with a strong and soothing 
vOIce. 

"They're coming." 
A voice I recognized to be hers seemed to 

emanate from the embers, Galatea turned her 
faraway gaze to me ~ the voice spoke between us. 

"I've seen a viSion. Pamted on the flames I saw a 
woman dressed In a flOWing crimson cape . She 
warned lIIe the Bluejaccs will attack our vrllage at 
dawn." 

The Bludaces landed in an empty village. 
They removed their helmets and , unaccustomed 
to our cold Wintry planet, their faces turned blue. 
As our people w.ltched m hiding, they talked 0; 
another Galatean miracle , Was It a mmlcle . 
When she spoke to me before the heanh with the 
VOICe , I hstened In wonder. But as she ran through 
the streets shouting her warnmg, she sounded 
too real to be mysti cal. Galate<l mSlsted II was no 
mlratie , so the Village rs heg.1n to Simply call her 
the M,ml 

* * * 

Pygmalia picked up the canister, broke the seal and 
popped the lid. A black cloud-like powder rose, 
ca using her nostrils to Ilare . "A p.leasant fragrance. 
These ashes must have been gathered from burned 
fruit trees or a funeral p,ulor's burning of [loral wreaths, 
That's a bit morbid isn't it?" 

Ruhbing the black powder between her fingers, 
Pygmalia seemed to rcturn to her trance. 

There rs a soJt delicate power in these hands: . 
"This powder feels unusually soft and delicate In my 

hands." She began applying the charcoal to the paper_ 
"I always begin with the eyes. If I can draw OUI the 
hght that relfeclS from the pupil, that brightest 
illumination of an Illustration , that point of persona , 
the portrait will ripple effonlessly outward ,". 

She looked up to the audience. "Shall I give her a 
slightly closed-eye seductive gaze?" 

No. Alert eyes. A soldrer's eyes, a cl1Ild's cyes, Keep them 
open 10 see what is happenrng In thrs world, 

"No change that~ let's give he~ alen eyes, I'll ,open

Sergeant Sawge stood at attention before 
Lieutenant Leathereyes' desk, waiting for the 
Vosges officer to acknowledge his presence_ The 
leathery toughness of his eyes came from years of 
screaming at his troops. leathereyes stared out 
the window of his command chamber to the 
black ash battlefield of another defeat at the 
hands of the Blueface invaders. He spoke to an 
absent anny below, 

"Our men are always beaten because they fight 
only to save the skin within their armor, and the 
easiest way to save their skin is to abandon their 
armor and run away." Leathereyes turned on hiS 
heal to face Savage. "The only thing that can save 
Vosges now IS a miracle ." 

"00 you expect me to fight a war with rumors, 
sergeant?" LeJthereyes lowered into his chair, 
leaned back, and looked through the skylight 
<lbove. "Even if this Maid hasa miraculous Voice, 
our men would never follow a woman into battle .. 

"[ have soldiered for many years sir, and never 
have I heard such a commanding voice. Would it 
harm to listen to her, sir? She could possibly be 
used as an informant." Savage exited to 
Leathereyes' nod, and qUickly returned with a 
plainly dressed young woman, 

" I ash you to Jorge me a SUIt oj steel. Carve a 
wounded brrd ralSlngjrom ashes on the chestplate to 
symbolIZe our juture VICtOry 111 balllshing the 
Blucja cs 011 Vosges," 

leathereyes rose from his chair as if in 
response to a higher mnkmg officer. ' Why do 
you seek to wear clothing that IS unnatuml for a ' 
woman ?" 

As if she were dealing with a child . Galatea 
motioned for Leathere)'es to be seated. "When tile 
Jlre oj rel'OIUlIOlI enters a person's bosom It burns all 
past dothlng. Already the Blueja e generals have 
heard Illy voice echo throughout our land, From this 
dayjorward I shall be a captive slave oj my oWlljame 
impnsoncd In a metal jrame. 1 must conceal my 
Identity within the cocooned cham mall oj llIale 
anllor. 

* * * 
Running her fingers through her shoulder length 

silver curls Pygmalia tossed a sly smile to the audience_ 

"To retain her feminine nature within the male armor, 
and seduce the male reader, I'll draw long curly 
cascades of black hair." 

Wait one mOlllcnt! A jull jace soldier's helmet rs not 
spacious enough jor all that hair. Cut the chaUVinistiC 
curls. This is a woman 's talr. 

"Wail, just kiddmg. Long hair is not realistic. 
conSideri ng she has to wear a helmet. A simple 
pageboy cut will do." Pygmalia signaled Kim. 

* * * 
"I lead my legioll with a. velvet hand In a steelfist, " 

said my sister as she slid her delicate hand into 
the gauntlet that ht the viclOry torches 
illumimwng our way out of a dark past. She 
strode to the threshold of her chamber and took 
one last unshielded look at the new day. 

"Ahhh .. , " 
"Galatea!" I rushed 10 catch her falling body, A 

seeke r arrow pierced her throat. Her voice raged 
red streams of bloody silent screams. Hopelessly 
I watched our vOice and victories about to die. 

Fire . _. lIeck ... now! 
Galatea 's twO woman attendants, Kathleen 

and Marlowe, peered at each orher, perplexed 
Kathleen snapped the seeker's shaft. then 
withdrew the arrow. Marlowe snalched a 
smoldering stick from the heanh anu scared 
Galatea's neck. 

Let me rest 1I0W When I awaken we shall strike 
our enemy wrth a lIew weapon , a legIOn oj women 
wamors who thlllk as ail e, 

* * * 
"Damn! Quick!" Pygmalia fell off the table. "Kim , 

hand me a towel before I blc!'u aU over the stage: 
People in the firsl row leaped to assisl her. . 

"I'm all right." She pressed the red stained whrte 
towel tighdy to the wound . "I was so caught up in the 
Story I must've slipped , cutting myself on the edge of 
the paper." 

"Do you want to continue?" Kim . asked wilh a . .. 
concerned look. "Did any blood drIp on the drawmg? 

"Just a small stain on the neck." She removed the 
towel and accepted a bandage from one of the

Where were we KIm? 

* * * 
Torches burned brightly from every pillar in 

the Great Star Chamber, shi mmering on 
Galatea's armor like red-orange suns setti ng in a 
silver-blue ocean, The Mute Maid stood 
triumphantly on a pedestal between Vosges and 
Bllleface generals. She looked out into the deep 
ravine of rebel receptors. women who stalemated 
the Vasges and Bludace male armies with their 
gendered gift to speak out across vast spaces. 

Sisters, I shall soon shed the concealment and 
constraints oj tillS male cocOQn, andwalkamongyou 
as all equal, each oj us listening 10 our own voices. 

The voices of hundreds of women m the Star 
Chamber volleyed to Galatea's words as 
thousands of soldiers from both armies watched 
with confusion and contempt. leathen~yes 
handed the treaty to ' Galatea to sign as the 
commander of the women w.lrriors_ Hundreds of 
minds read with her the agreement between 
Vosges and Blueface generals banning Galatea 
from wearing male clothing and banishing her to 
a penal colony. She held the treaty aloft for <III to 
see, then put a torch to the treachery. 

"Arrest her for treason ," 
* * * Pygmalia paused and stared at her hands. 

Are these really my hands, now completely covered with 
black powder? Will I ever be able to wash away the residue 
oj so many burned vU/ages laid waste jor heroIC battles? I 
expected a peacejul life. But here I am, the first to be seen, 
poised bejore the Jront /riles oj yet another lege ndary ballie. 

"Is it the wound ." Kim asked. 
"No, Just a feeling of defeat." Pygmalia slghed_ 

"Women have fought so many battles. and there are so 
many trials yet to come." Turning to the audience as if 
on trial herself she asked , "What shall be the final 
gesture? Her mute mouth must reveal her reaction to 
the betrayal? Shall it be a defiant frown , an angered 
sneer, or a cry for mercy7 A frown , that's it. Draw the 
sympathy of the reader."

Swimmers kick in Atlanta 

National waterworks 
By ALICIA AGOS, port( Edtror 

BOTH THE MEN'S and women's UCSD swim teams competed in CAA Division 111 ational 
Championships over the last few weeks, 
and the slmllarl!les berween the tWO-
borh the teams and the competition 
results-are strikmg. Bmh TrIton reams , 
although compeung at different dates in 
the same Atlanta pool , placed third 
(team-wise ) overall, behind a strong 
Claremont team (Pomona-Pitzer in the 
women's case), and the ever-dominant 
Ken}'on College, a team which, for the 
la t seven consecutive years, has failed 
to rehnqulsh that coveted # 1 mle. 

The championships capped ofT what 
has been a very successful and 
espeCially reJuvenaung aquaric season 
for UCSD. Coach Bill Morgan IS the 
head of a tcam which is doing great 
thmgs In lenns of both improVing the 
populanty and Splrll of intercollegiate 
.lthleucs here on campus, and also 
improving UCSD status as a rising 
nauonal contender. And this is from a 
te.lm Morgan calls. 'one of, if nOl the , 
closest-knit groups I've ever coached." 

Going into competition . hopes were 
high for the 22 San Diego qualirlers. 
Tralnmg through and competing In dual 
meets, the seasonal goal (that of 
quahfp ng for Nationals) was more 
individual than team And smce most of 
these dual meets were a~ainst swimmers 
who were present In Atlanta , 
intImidation and uncertainty didn't 
exactly pose a big problem for UCSD. In 
fact, it was almost pre-determined that 
Kenyon-the non-stop swimming 
machine of Ohio-would take the 

a[lonal mle eaSily. That they did, but it 
was in second and third places where 
the competition lay. The San Diego 

men , who went in confident and 
psyched to the Pac West 
Championships, finished third there in 
Seattle and were picked to place second 
in Atlanta . Claremont-Mudd , however, 
was the team to deal with, and as Senior 
Bill Kazmierowicz reports, "After the 
second day, we were out of Claremont's 
range . Going in , we'd hoped to beat 
them, but they just swam out of their 
heads. It was close until the second day, 
but we swam solidly. We s,ored 130 
more points than we did in last )Iear's 
competition. We did really well . It was a 
great experience." Kazmierowlcz was 
one of three Tritons who combined to 
win four indiVidual national tides. 
Kazmierowicz, who Will be returning 
next year for one more year of UCSD 
competition, captured his third 
Individual mIl" in two years with his 
Tmon record [lme of 51.48 in the 100 
backstroke. He also earned a pair of 
fourth-place finishes in the 50 and 100 
freestyle . 

Roger Bnsbane , a transfer who has 
been a sound addition to the UCSD 
program , became the first (and only) 
DiviSion Ul swimmer to break the 1'50 
plateau in the 200 butterfly when he 
swam a 1:49.87 In Saturday night's fmal. 
It was Friday night that Brisbane 
finished second in the 100 butterfly 
with another UCSD record setter of 
49.63. 

UCSD's strong showing was helped 
immeasurably by the perfonnance of 
diver Jeff Stabile . This freshman won 
(WO individual titles with his standout 
exhibitions in the one and three meter 
dives. The fun doesn 't end here [or 
Stabile. His performance in Atlanta 
enables him to advance to thIS week's 

CIII Morgan 's men 's team placed thrrd In natumal competition, and three Tritons combined 
to Win Jour indIVidual national titles. 

Division I Championships at the 
Universi ty of Texas. 

UCSD records were set by Reed , 
Butch Cramer, Brisbane and 
Kazmierowicz in the 400 1M relay; by 
Peter Dobias in the 400 1M; and Jon 
Irwin, Dobias, Cramer and 
Kazmierowicz in the 800 Free Relay. 

The San Diego women also finished 
third , also behind a Claremont team 
(this time it was Pomona-Pitzer) , and , 
again, the ever-present Kenyon. The 
winning ani tude of Morgan and his 
swimmers, all of his swimmers, helped 
push UCSD to a surprising, at least to 

some people, finish of third. Placing 
third of more than 80 teams, especially 
after being targeted to place fifth , shows 
the depth and strength the Triton's 
posess. Freshman Tracey Mulvaney. as 
well as Allison Gilmore, Irene Mons, 
Jackie Van Egmond, LeAnn Brown and 
Lauren Knochenhauer, provided the 
strong showings which enabled UCSD to 
finish a close thi rd behind Pomona-
Pitzer. On the second day of 
competition, in fact, it was the Triton's 
who led Pomona in the point standing, 
only to be edged out by a mere 13 'h 
points in the final team standings. ~

Canyonview facility to open Wednesday 

Weighting 
on a friend 
By ALICIA AGOS, ports Erillor 

C HARLES ATlAS would he proud , ThiS Wednesday, anyone who is Willing to make the trek down to 
Warren has the chance to see 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson pump 
some Iron at UCSO's new and Improved 
weight room The opening ceremonies 
for the as yet unoffiCially-named Canyon 
View Weight Training Facility will get 
underway some time around 1 pm, and 
some of the hlg names expected to 
appe,lr <llld pJniclpate In the event are , 
dmong others, Ch,mcellor Rlch,mj 

tklnson , Vlce-Ch,mcellor Joe Watson 
. .lnd Gene Fisher Jeslgner of the 
custom-bUIlt equipment Inst.alled In the 
new f.lclhty 

But It b .l1~11 hoped that st.udents Will 
"ppe"r ilt thiS function, hCCJU l' l[ IS 
thc) for whom thl., wClght room has 
been designcd and built. The 30,000 
pent on training eqUipment and 
15,000 uscd to renO\'ate the Warren 

buildmg was alloted by the Reg Fee 
committee over a year-and-a-half ago. 
Ben Kohayashi th111ks that the money 
has heen well pcnt m Improving on the 
prevIous UCSO weight room. a faCility 
he thought "a Joke. Many, many high 
schools havc hetter systems than our old 
weight room. I thmk people will go wild 
over thiS new one. The machines and 
the OlympiC free weight systems will be 
enough' for an>' person who is interested 
m bod)' budding. Having both of these 
IS J bonus For example, whoever is 
using the weight room can do the free 
weights, then go to the machines." 

All UCSD students, plus anyone with 
a rec priVilege card will be allowed to 
use the Fisher equipment and, although 
Fisher, an ex-olympiC weight lifter, isn't 
exacuy one of the big names in weight 
traini ng, the quality of this eqUipment , 
says Kohayashi, is nonetheless excellent . 
"All the equipment was custom-made for 
UCSD. It's all fi nished with a blue and 
gold spray. San Diego State has some of 
the Fisher equipment. and checking 
With them. I found they were vety 
enthusiastic about his (Fisher's) 
elluipmem. It's better than the hig name 
equi pment and we got it all for at least 
the same pnce as we would've paid for 
Atlas." 

Kobayashi , who "cringed" every time 
he thought of UCSO'S old weight room 
(which is still open and is still located 
downstairs 111 the mail.\.gym). is 
expecting the new weight room to get 
"heavy use the minute we're open. The 
old weight room has been renovated as 
well . and eve n though it's nice to look 
at, it's not as good as the new faci li ty." 

Kobayashi is anxious to get as many 
students as possible, espeCially the 
Warren students, involved in the use of 
and the care for the new and very 
valuable equipment . Located at the 
South edge of Warren West Flcld , the 
latest extension of Canyon View 
Recreation is in c1o:;e proximity to the 
Warre n Apallment dwe llers. AnJ , 
although an attende nt will be present 
dUring all operating hours. KohayJshi IS 
"hoping to lISC Warren Students to help 
he protective of it- in case some van all 
of a suddcn shows up at 2 am unJ 
somehody sl.tns to lo.ld up on all that 
equipment We hope to et up ome

Good friends will give you a break

The dinner was sensationaL So was the 
check. The problem is, the theater tickets that 
you insisted on buying broke your whole 
budget. Enough to declare bankruptcy by the 

time the coffee arrived, 
;.~ A nudge under the table and a certain 

destitute look in the eye were enough to 
produce the spontaneous loan only a 

good friend is ready to make. 
How do you repay him? First 

the cash, then the only beer equal

Joe Watson: IIBada 
Diet Saved My Life" 

By B.B. "Running Gag" LEONE 
At a news conference today, UCSD 

Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate 
Affairs Joseph Watson announced that 
he would be endorsing Scripps 
Institution Chemist Dr. Jeffrey Bada's 
controversial D-/somer diet, and advised 
that the Bada diet should be part of a 
UCSD weight reduction and physical 
fitness program. "I lost more than a 
hundred pounds in a month, and I ate all 
that I wanted to eat, " said Watson. 

The diet, which COnsiSts of uSing d-
Isomers instead of the nutritionally 
usable I-isomers of amino adds in food, IS 
acclaimed by some as a r~/utionary 
means of controlling obesity, but 
condemned by others as being 
expensive and counter-productlVe, since 
it does not force people to change 
destructive or counter-productive or just 
plain stupid eating habits. 

This has not deterred Watson's 
ad\.ocacy of the diet "Just think, here at 
UCSD we have a captive population of 

students to use this stuff on, and a 
captive population of med students who 
can do the testing and other stuff for 
credit," said Watson. " I Glh't think of a 
better integration of the various parts of 
this diverse school ," commented 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson. Atkinson 
said that a bunch of medical students 
checklng on a bunch of undergraduates 
eating an experimental diet developed 
by a Scripps professor wasjust the sort of 
project that would put UCSD on the 
map. "If thiS takes off like the Pritikln 
diet. the publiCIty may mean more to 
UCSD than the Supercomputer and 
Engineering school accreditation 
combined." 

When asked about hiS own plans for 
the diet, Dr. Bada said that a University-
wide study was not in the cards as a next 
step. "I think I'll have to do some more 
Individual tests on administration and 
faculty, like Tommy Tucker or Bob Moss. 
Those vvou/d be real challenges for my 
diet plan." 

REJUVENATED: A 'new' Joe Watson looks 
15 years younger after going on new diet. 

Jimmy Hoffa found at Central Burbidge is God By B.B. "Cut the Gag" LEONE 
The body of Jimmy Hoffa, former 

Teamsters Union preSident and mob 
racketeer who disappeared In the 19705, 
was found two days ago in the fire stairs 
of Central Ubrary on the third floor 
landing Michael "the SterlIng Prince" 
Cor leone , arrested yesterday by UCSD 
Parklng Enforcement Officers on the 
pretext of a dozen unpaid parking 
violations, has confessed to the crime. 

When contacted, FBI officials 
described the arrest as, "The gutsiest 
thing in the history oflaw enforcement." 
\XIhen asked to clarity that statement. 
one anonymous spokesman said that he 
wouldn't have captured Corleone 
without the 82nd Airborne Division as 
backup. 

Review, n.l. 
combine 

In an unprecedented move, the staffs 
of the right-wing California Review 
and the radical New IndIcator 
Collective have decided to join forces in 
order to fight the high cost of suing the 
AS council every month. Both 
publications are heavily in debt and 
were considering shutting down their 
operatiOns until it was suggested to 
them by Media Board Commissioner Ken 
Cariffe to pool their resources and fight 
the anti-intellectual AS CounCil. 

When asked whether or not his 
tabloid is consideringjointly publishing a 
new newspaper with the Review, New 
Indicator glass house cynic Rambling 
Rosie replied, " It's definitly not out of the 
question. As you know, we have been 
closet StalinistS for many years. I think it's 
time we come out of the closet and 
show the vvor/d who we really are." 
\XIhen asked by a bewildered reporter 
what he meant. Rosie roared, "Come 
now brother, don't hand me that elitist 
linel You understand our intent perfectly. 
The only reason why we preach Mal)( 
instead of Martin Feldstein is because 
Mal)( was more in line With our Ideals of 
sexual submiSSion." 

It has been rumored that the 
Callfomla Review's motivation for 
teaming up with such lucid thinkers like 
Rosie stems from a very similar 
interpretation of political ends. When 
told of ROSie's comments, Defender of 
Freedom CG. Alano responded, 
"Rosie's right. Oops I I mean Rosie's left . 
No, that's not what I mean. What I want 
to say IS that we feel we've been 
misinterpreted too Lots of our readers 
belteve that we hold the Ideological keys 
to the true, democratic way. And there is 
some validity to that But not in the way 
most people think." - M.J.8. CRONIN

evidence against Cor/eon~ was firm. "He

Sidlian manhood. "I thought it was the 
. perfect place," he said. " I duq1ped the 
stiff on the landing, then \/Vent up and 
down the . building, slapping these 
adhesive stid<ers that said 'Emergency 
Exit Only' on all the doors to that 
stairwell. It was a perfect plan." 

I ne discoverer of the slain labor 
rad<eteer was also in jail today. Victor 
Norgev, a Visual Arts major from Muir, 
was using the emergency stairwell to 
steal the 150 \lQ/umes he felt were 
necessary to complete ris thesis. "I 
tripped over this thing in the stairs about 
three times before I finally came down 
with only eight books in my hands. I 
could see over those and find out 
whatever that thing was," said a 

San Diego Attorney Maxwell Ndff, u, 
the firm /(jan, Oscarsohn, Simpson, Kian, 
Harmon, Kian and Lee, said that he 
would defend both Cor leone and 
Norgev without charge. 

E. Margaret Burbidge, whose first 
name is actually Ernestine, yesterday 
earned the prestigious God of the 
Human Race award for her 
achievements in astrono my, 
astrophysics, communication, 
diplomacy, shoe lacing, horse racing, 
gardening, machinery, tree surgery, 
broomball, cake decorating and the 
myriad other disciplines in which she is 
involved. 

" I am surprised and honored by this 
surprising honor. It was truly a sUrprise. I 

_ am honored," .said Burbidge, lIIIf10se 
merits in publiC speech \/Vere also lauded. 
"It Glme as such a shock. Arty of the 
other candidates deserved this award as 
much as I," When informed that no other 
candidates were nominated, she 
commented, "My, that's a shOck. I am 
surprised and honored." 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson was 
pleased with the announcement. "No 
one on this earth deserves such an 
award more than E. Margaret. Her 
efforts toward improving the quality of 
education and life in general on this 
campus and throughout the planet are 
outstanding and extraordinary and 
really neat. E. Margaret is truly God 
incamate, and I intend to change my 
religion today," said Atkinson, currently 
a Buddhist. 

Burbidge received the award at a 
luncheon in Budapest. The presentation 

of the 40-foot gold cross was made by a 
very big Hungarian gentleman who 
competed for his country In the 1000-
meter steeplechase at the 1984 Soviet 
Games, and lost. The gentleman 
grunted how surprised and honored he 
was to be able to present the 2500-/b. 
award. Burbidge followed by expressing 
her sentiments of surprise and honor 
about the gentleman's surprise and 
honor before a large crowd of people 
who really didn't care. 

ERNES11NE: Surprised, honored. 

Good News For 100 Million at UCSD 
Amazing Eucalyptus Hair Treatment 

A remarkable new material derived 
from euGllyptus bark is actually making 
new hair grow on bald heads in the 
battle against baldness, say experts at 
Scripps. 

'We've had fantastic results with this 
new material Koa/axy/apatite," said Dr. 
Reese Harry Line, chairman of 
hairodo/oty at UCSD's School of Global 
Baldness. " I have personally treated 
dozens of faculty and staff members with 
a remarkable success rate of 59%. The 
material actually regenerates half that 
has been eradicated through excessive 
pulling dUfing finals week. 

" We 're very confident with 
Koa/axy/apatlte-we know it's going to

Drug-Crazed Rodent 
Saves Burning Worker 
From Eternal Mufflnhood 
By HONKY MO FO 

"I WAS BAKED ALlVEII" said Food 
Services Director Brian Pickel, who had 
fallen Into a 3QO-gallon mixer of 
blueberry muffin mix and was 
acddentally baked in a Revelle Cafeteria 
oven. If it had not been for an escaped 
laboratory "superrat" from Urey Hall 
that was the product of a gene-spliang 
experiment with "Scrufty the Wonder 
8asethound, " Pickel said he would have 
"ended up in the stomachs of hundreds 
of pre-meds and in the laps of thousands 
of EECS majors." 

cage bars and Insrrnarvely followed its 
basethound nose to the blueberry 
muffin aroma. The valuable experimental 
animal. which was estimated to move at 
speeds of over 103 mph as she crossed 
Revelle Plaza, led anXiously pursUing 
researchers to the oven where Pickers 
hair was beginning to curl from the 
intense heat. Paramedics arrived on the 
scene shortly thereafter and spent two 
hours sucking the muffin mix out of 
Pickers lungs with "The Esophagus of 
Ufe," their new sucking device who is 
also a part-time philosophy major at 
Muir College. 

Pickel's miraculous salvation came 
when the "superrat. " which had been 
trained to navigate mazes baited with 
blueberry muffin crumbs after being 
subjected to massive doses of fine 
SolMan cocaine, chewed through her 

"That damned rat saved me from the 
big one," Pickel said after being gnawed 
dean. Pickel then said he was going to 
quit the food service business and move 
to Indiana with his new lifetime 
companion, "Muffins the Superrat." 

BAKE-OFF: Brian Pickel shows the oven he was trapped in with 
"Muffins the Superrat."

Highway 101 
rammed down 
UCSD's throat 

By DANIEL THOMAS 
A hitherto unknown source in 

Sacramento today revealed that 
CalTrans has plans to re-<>pen US 
Highway 101 through the length of the 
UCSD campus, from Gilman Drive to the 
Institute of the Americas. Numerous 
buildings will be demolished or tunneled 
under to effect this conversion of our 
main drag from sylvan footpath to 
rumbling coast highllvay. 

The Chancellor's Office was not called 
for comment. but lma Rockslide, ex-
directrix of CalTrans (when \/Ve did not 
reach her) neither denied nor confirmed 
the plans of her one-time department. 
"Jerry vvould never have let them/us do 
this, not Moonbeam, no, he loved your 
beadl, yes, bUt enough's enough, 
y'know? Now the Duke, he's an arm 
and leg of another coat altogether. I 
lNOuldn't put it past him. Probably some 
three-way interchange he cut with the 
Legislature and the Regents." 

Again, the Chancellor's Office was 
not called for comment, but the UCSD 
architect. when he was not called, did 
not explain Glrefully how the old coast 
highway used to run smack through the 
(temporary7l) student center, under the 
(unsinkable?) S.S. Mand~lIe, then 
straight past Muir and out through 
Tnrd. "Portions of the new highway 
could be located underground," the 
architect did not exp/"in. 'We could 
avoid destruction of buildings that have 
a few good years left in them. Except for 
the old student center," he did not wink, 
knowingly, "of course." 

This newspaper attempted to re-
contact the unknown source in 
Sacramento, to report to him or her 
what Rockslide and neither the 
Chancellor nor the architect had said. 
But we were unable to reach her or him. 
Something about the wires being down, 
cut by highway vvorkers, was all the 
operator could say before the bulldozer 
came crashing through this editorial 
wall.

The Big Time: Tritons-vs. Hoyas 
By PHIL lAUDER, Sports Editor at Heart 

The UCSD Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics and Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson formally announced 
Friday the formation of a Division I 
football team. The announcement 
follows 16 years of diSCUSSIon and 
frustration among students, faculty and 
staff, and IS a dream come true to many 
on campus. 

All right. so every Apr" Fools issue on 
thIS campus since tIme began has had a 
story on the fictItious UCSD football 
team. Christ. If there were a real football 
team, the Koala would have nothing to 
rant and rave about to fill their eight 
pages of dribble. See, UCSD having a 
football team is about as likely as the 
Chargers winning the Super Bowl in this 
millenium, so every parody rag in the 
world has to pounce on the subject. 
Therefore, we WIll hereby desIst from 
further ramblings. 

Well, how about another sport7 Hey, 
you name itl You want tennis7 Women's 
tennis against the US Davis Cup team7 
How about men's soccer in the World

who won yet another award for 
something or other the other night. 
Coached by John Thompson, a real 
sweetheart if ever one existed, the 
Hoyas are exceptional down the middle 
and solid from the perimeter, with very 
few weaknesses all around, except in 
public speakIng. Georgetown held the 
top spot in the nation for the first few 
weeks of the season before a 
showdown with the Tritons in mid-
February, a contest UCSD dominated to 
capture the #1 ranking, holding it 
through the remainIng six weeks of 
regular-season play. 

UCSD IS led by the big man in the 
middle, 6-8 Mike Dabaslnskas. "Dabo, " 
as he's known to many. says his 
nickname really sucks and anyone 
caught uSIng it will die immediately if not 
sooner, so we'll refrain from using it 
further here. Guards Brandon Nixon (32 
points per game) and Greg Kamansky 
(28 ppg) are coming off All-American 
seasons, as IS forward Mark Barrecca. or 
Barecca. or Barreca, or Barecka or

UCSD welcomes Kiraly 
By AUCIA AGOS 

It's a dream come true for the UCSD 
men's volleyball program. Finally, 
something-someone, actually-has 
come along to San Diego to rescue the 
Tritons from the depths of Division III 
volleyball. Karch Kiraly, UCLA AII-
American, OlympiC gold medarist and 
Rhoades Scholar, has officially been 
accepted to the UCSD Medical School 
and has been cleared by the NCAA to 
become a member of the Triton 
volleyball squad. 

Kiraly doesn't exactly need to try out 
for the team. His ability at the net and on 
the court is incredible. His addition to 
Digger Graybill's team, according to the 
ecstatic coach, "will be an amazing 
boost to our team. Having someone 
WIth Karch's ability here at our school is 
something we've only dreamed of. I 
thInk that hIS presence here IS the final. 
added extra push we've been needIng to 
lift us Into th ranks of DiVISIon I ThIs WIll . 
really get us mOVIng RealistIcally, I think, 
we C n sr rt t.::llklng National 
Ch mp/on hip " 

Klr(l wa d to San DI qo both 
d dl/y nd c' leocally As 

continuing member of the US national 
team, Kiraly practices with the OlympIC 
team daily, 8 am to noon at the Federal 
Building in Balboa Park. This practice 
schedule will . allow the 1982 UCLA 
graduate the time needed to attend med 
school classes and Triton volleyball 
practice in the aftemoon. 

Former volleyball All-American and 
former US national team member Ed 
Machado, who is now a member of the 
UCSD PE faCUlty, reluctantly admits that 
he may have had something to .do with 
Kiraly's dedsion to continue his studies 
at UCSD. 'Well ... I guess I might've 
talked to Karch about it a couple of 
times. But. you know, in the end the 
decision was his." 

Kira Iy wi II be the second in a short line 
of US Olympic gold medalists to attend 
UCSD. Speed kater Enc HeIden was the
