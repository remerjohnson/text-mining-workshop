UNIVERSITY  CENTERS

D’Lush 
Announces 
Eco-Friendly 
Initiative

SUSTAINABILITY

New post-consumer takeout 
boxes and a bring-your-own-
cup promotion are coming to 
the Price Center location.

BY  M eryl  Press
Associate News editor

Price Center’s D’lush will 
participate in a new, eco-friendly 
sustainability program called “Bottle 
in the Box” and “It’s What’s on the 
Inside that Counts.” 

In an interview with the UCSD 
Guardian, founder Jeffery Adler said 
the store will join the Bottle in the 
Box initiative — a new, 100-percent 
post-recycling food container that 
is made out of two already-recycled 
bottles which had been taken and 
separated from a landfill. Previously, 
the outlets used were “compostable” 
plates and packaging, which are the 
most efficient forms of packaging. 

However, because San Diego 
County does not have sorters who 
separate those plates and containers 
from regular trash, the business was 
forced to switch in order to be more 
environmentally friendly. 

The other project, It’s What’s on 
the Inside that Counts, allows a 
customer to bring in any vessel to 
use as a cup. D’lush will then sanitize 
the cup and place the desired D’lush 
product inside and the customer 
will receive a 10-cent discount 
on the product. The vessel or cup 
used can range from a Starbucks or 
Jamba Juice cup to a regular mug or 
a water bottle. 

Adler explained that 
environmental responsibility 
trumps brand awareness, and 
that the company is willing to 
subordinate its brand positioning 
due to a greater need for recycling. 

“We’re serving the environment 
one cup at a time by micro 
impacting, [and] sustainability is 
something that we are pioneering 
for the first time on this campus,” 
Adler said. “D’lush’s whole belief 
system is all about the power of 
small actions — changing the world 
one drink at a time.”

He added that the new moves 
follow other “green” initiatives 
previously implemented by D’lush.

“[Being a] big, consumer-facing 
brand led to [several] initial smaller 
moves to use packaging that’s very 
green, and now we are launching 
our Choose to Reuse campaign,” 
Adler said.

As a similar act of environmental 
awareness, D’lush is also 
introducing glass bottles onto its 
menu. On Nov. 15, the company 
will bring in 2,000 glass bottles and 
give away 25 percent of those to 
students. Logistics for distribution 
are yet to be determined. However, 
the amount of glass bottles that 
students return with will determine 
the program’s success.

Each time a student reuses 
his or her glass bottle, a D’lush

Che Supporters Take to Streets
BY  TINA  BUTOIU  associate NEWS editor photo  bY  Daniel Roberto

Members of the Che Cafe and their sup-porters organized and held a protest against the judge’s verdict that the 
Che Cafe needs to evict its historic on-cam-
pus location. The protest began at 10 a.m. this 
past Tuesday and continued for a few hours.

Over 50 protesters met at the Che Cafe and 
marched to Chancellor Khosla’s office with a petition 
against the Che’s eviction bearing 14,000 signatures 
from UCSD students and community members. 
Khosla had not been in his office at the time, but his 
secretary accepted the petition and the group expects 
a response from the university within seven days.

Rene Vera, recent UCSD graduate and 

a principal member of the collective, told 
those in attendance that he hopes the peti-
tion encourages the university not to enforce 
San Diego Superior Court Judge Katherine 
A. Bacal’s ruling for the Che Cafe’s eviction.

“We’re hoping that the petition puts pressure 
on [the University] to back off the eviction on the 
Che Cafe and forces them to let graduate students 
and the Associated Students to determine what 
facts [regarding the eviction] are in play,” said Vera.  

UCSD freshman and Che Cafe member Mau-
ro Chavez told the UCSD Guardian he hopes 
that the protest will bring awareness to the stu-
dent body with regards to the organization.

CAMPUS

Pre-Midterm Election Debate Draws Dozens
College Democrats and Republicans express contrasting views in quarterly event. 

Less than one week away from 
the Nov. 4 midterm election, the 
UCSD College Democrats and 
College Republicans at UCSD held 
their quarterly debate in front of 
roughly 50 attendees on Tuesday, 
Oct. 28, in the Student Services 
Center Multipurpose Room.

The UCSD Guardian Editor-in-
Chief Zev Hurwitz moderated the 
debate, which was co-sponsored by 
the Student Organized Voter Access 
Committee and the Guardian. 

The topics debated were 
the minimum wage increase, 
entitlement reform and higher 
education. 

In line with previous debates, 
18 minutes were spent on the first 
two topics. For each one, both 
parties prepared a two-minute 
introduction, three-minute rebuttal, 
two-minute second rebuttal and 
one-minute concluding statement. 

Daniel Firoozi, from the College 
Democrats, opened for the first 
topic debated: raising the national 
minimum wage.

He argued that it should be raised 
to $10.10 in order to provide a basic 
living for members of the working 

class and noted that the solution was 
imperfect but would improve the 
economy in the long run. 

Part of his argument included 
his family’s personal experience 
owning a Quiznos in Texas that 
paid workers $10 an hour when the 
state’s minimum wage was at $5.45. 
He said that the business was more 
successful than the Subway across 
the street —which paid workers 
minimum wage — because workers 
were able to provide better customer 
service while worrying less about 
making ends meet.

The College Republicans 
countered Firoozi by stating that 
the minimum wage is detrimental 
to society. According to Sean 
Gallagher, most economists agree 
that a high minimum wage damages 
the economy, since it discourages 
employers from hiring more 
workers and potentially results 
cutbacks on current workers. He 
also argued that a higher minimum 
wage increases the cost of goods 
which decreases the amount that 
consumers are willing to purchase. 
In addition, the College Republicans 
said that history demonstrates that 
low-skill, minimum wage jobs are 
increasingly replaced by machines 
and that a higher minimum wage 
would accelerate the process.

The second topic debated 
was entitlement reform, which 
Republican Richard DeThorpe 
introduced. He explained that 
Republicans want reform by 
adjusting entitlements for inflation. 
Also, the College Republicans 
argued that, in order to insure 
that U.S. Social Security funds 
do not run out, the minimum 
retirement age should be raised to 
70 years old because birth rates are 
decreasing and the average lifespan 
is increasing. In addition, they said 
that Social Security was established 
in 1935 when most men retired after 
the age of 65.

Democrat John O’Brien 
countered by stating that entitlement 
reform does not solely focus on 
social security and that individuals 
pay into it throughout their lives, 
making it is a right they should 
have access to. Furthermore, he 
iterated the idea of means-testing 
an individual’s income to determine 
whether or not they are in actual 
financial need of Social Security 
benefits.

The debate concluded with each 
side having five minutes to present 
arguments on their party’s vision for 
the future of higher education.

A coin toss determined that

HEALTH 

Five UC Medical Centers Named as Possible Ebola Centers

On Oct. 10, the University Office 
of the President announced that all 
five of the University of California 
Medical Centers are available 
as priority hospitals to provide 
treatment for Californians with 
confirmed cases of Ebola, should it 
become necessary.  

In such cases, the UC Health 
Centers are all level-one trauma centers 
or level-one staff centers, meaning 
that they are able to provide several 
aspects of intensive care ranging from 
prevention to rehabilitation. The 
campuses that are affiliated with these 
health centers include UC Davis, UC 
Irvine, UCSD, UCLA and UC San 
Francisco. 

These centers are not identified 
as facilities in which infected patients 
transported into the United States 
by the U.S. State Department will be 
treated. 

The UCs have partnered with 
California’s Department of Public 
Health in order to ensure that 
their facilities have the most recent 
information on how to care for and 
treat Ebola patients. The CDPH also 
pledged to help these centers obtain 
the required personal protective 
equipment if they face sourcing 
challenges.

Furthermore, the Division of 
Occupational Safety and Health will 
be working with the UC Medical 
Centers by providing updated, 
specific guidelines on the protective 
equipment, training, and more 
extensive measures that must be 
organized in order to protect the 
health and safety of workers.

On Oct. 28, Dr. John Stobo, the 
senior vice president for health 
and services, made a statement in 
regards to the UC Medical Centers’ 
preparations.

“UC hospitals continue to do 
everything possible to ensure that 
our nurses, doctors and other health 

care workers are prepared for any 
eventuality related to Ebola,” Stabo 
said. “While we are far along in 
our preparations and activities, 
we continue to learn from each 
other, working with the state 
and other entities to ensure the 
safest environment possible for all 
working to address the challenges 
associated with Ebola.” 

Though there have been no 
confirmed cases of Ebola in 
California to date, the University 
of California says it is committed to 
addressing the health needs of the 
general public.

“As a part of a public university, 
stepping up to a public health crisis 
is what our medical centers do,” 
Brooke Converse, UCOP media 
specialist, said. 

In response to the outbreak, UC 
doctors and researchers are actively 
involved in battling the Ebola 
epidemic. UCSD, UC Irvine, UC 
Davis, UC Berkeley, UCSF, UCLA, 
UC Riverside, and UC Santa Cruz 

all have faculty experts involved in 
some way. 

At UCSD, brincidofovir, a 
drug developed in 1999 by Dr. 
Karl Hostetler as a way of fighting 
bioterrorism, is now being 
considered as a possible treatment. 

Brincidofovir is typically used 
to target double-stranded DNA 
viruses, while Ebola is a RNA virus. 
However, there has been evidence 
gathered in vitro that suggests that 
the drug may be altered in order to 
affect an RNA virus like Ebola.

Some of the advantages of 
brincidofovir include the fact that it 
is a small molecular drug, meaning 
that it can be manufactured quickly 
and easily scaled up. Furthermore, 
it is one of the few potential 
drugs being considered for Ebola 
treatment that has a history of being 
successfully tested on humans.

“We are hoping to gain formal 
recognition from the university that 
the Che Cafe is a space worth sup-
porting,” said Chavez. “This will 
prevent them from further ignor-
ing the voice of the community that 
is shouting for a dispute resolution.”

One of the concerns voiced by 
the protesters, including Mauro, 
was that the eviction of the Che sets 
a precedent for the dismantling of 
the other cooperatives on campus. 

“It’s unfortunate that the judge 

sided with the university,” said Mauro. 
“It gives legal precedent to kick out 
other co-ops that are currently op-
erating in ways similar to the Che. It 
shows that a level of neglect on the 
side of the university has not been 
properly addressed and that student 
co-ops can be forced to take the fall.”

Che Cafe organizers were back in 
court on Wednesday as part of a par-
tial appeal process to Bacal’s ruling. 
Currently, the collective is in standing 
to communicate with the GSA and 
examine the information that led to 
its decertification late last spring. Ad-

ditionally, the collective hopes A.S. 
Council will vote to create a special 
committee that will work with the col-
lective and determine that it is finan-
cially stable enough to operate. The 
Che is also organizing a Know Your 
Rights workshop for Friday, Oct. 31 at 
3 p.m. in which members and support-
ers of the collective can learn about 
what legal rights their members have 
as part of a student organization. Jose-
lynn Ordaz contributed to this report.

D’lush, Other Campus Food Outlets Introduce New Green Efforts

employee will record it. If the drink 
sales the company receives from 
the glass bottles are between 10 
and 20 percent, then the company 
will expand the program to its 
Hollywood location.

In an interview with the Guardian,  
University Centers Advisory Board 
Chair Claire Maniti explained that 
businesses at UCEN have been moving 
toward green initiatives over the past 
several years and that there has been 

pressure on Price Center vendors to 
become more sustainable for the past 
five years.

“Students have been the 
main source of the push [for 
sustainability],” Maniti said. “It’s 
important to [UCEN] and it’s 
what students want from vendors 
at UCSD. I definitely want to see 
UCEN centers becoming more 
sustainable and that’s [the direction] 
where it’s moving.”

A certain eco-friendly move that 
all vendors in Price Center have 

made over the past few years is 
removing all usage of styrofoam. 
In addition to replacing styrofoam, 
Santorini Greek Island Grill, also in 
Price Center, stopped selling bottled 
water. Additionally, Perks Coffee 
in the Bookstore recently has also 
gone green by providing discounts 
to customers if they bring in their 
own cups.

College Democrats, GOP Have Opposing Visions for UC System

the College Republicans would 
present first. Ellen Hendricks stated 
that higher education should include 
more practical, hirable skills in order 
to decrease unemployment among 
college graduates. Additionally, she said 
that a reformed admission criterion 
that involved a Maker Portfolio, now 

required of Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology applicants, would prepare 
students for a job market that has 
openings but lacks those with the 
appropriate skills to qualify for them.

Afterward, Firoozi explained the 
College Democrat views as favorable 
toward every individual having access 
to higher education and a need for 
more government funding. According 

to Firoozi, Republican governors and 
legislators have consistently slashed 
funding for the University of California 
and the California GOP platform has a 
section that specifically cuts funding 
from UCSD because undocumented 
students are permitted to attend.

How to Make
Sure You
Never, Ever
Get Laid 

Parties are the best. They’re veri-
table cauldrons of eligible, diverse and 
young college students. The magic of 
parties tends to be so fulfilling that 
you need to proactively ensure that 
no other parts of your life give you as 
much enjoyment. As an attendee of 
the said social event, it is your duty to 
do everything in your power to make 
sure you don’t bring anyone home and 
that you absolutely do not get laid. 

How to go about attaining this 
goal is really a very simple process, 
which we will lay out for you — but of 
course, not with you — here in four 
easy steps. 

First: how to dress. Make sure your 
clothes are outdated by at least five 
years, if not a decade. Additionally, 
to avoid any mistaken perception as 
a trendy hipster trying to bring back 
the styles of yesteryear, wear clashing 
colors and patterns and have stains of 
questionable nature in visible places. If 
you must wear something that makes 
a statement, ensure the message 
makes you a maverick. “Bob Filner for 
Mayor” shirts or “#Kony2012” make 
solid, yet untimely political statements 
that no one will want to engage with.

Next: Do not talk to anyone. Stay 
in a corner and hang out with the 
best friend you’ll ever make: your 
phone. Keep your headphones in, 
but don’t connect them to any music-
playing device. Bring your own (non-
alcoholic) drink in a thermos, play as 
many games of tetris as possible and 
don’t make eye contact with anybody 
who may want to approach you for 
unwanted socializing. 

Third, and quite possibly the most 
effective tip here: Ensure everyone 
knows every last detail about your 
ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, from their 
favorite color right down to the lyrics 
to the song you wrote for them when 
you first started dating. Explain every 
reason and fight that led to the break-
up, and as an added bonus, conjure 
up some drunken tears to embellish 
the moment. Then tell whoever you’re 
talking to repeatedly that you are not 
in the slightest bit interested in explor-
ing anything new with anyone and 
that you’re not sure you will ever, ever 
get over your ex. 

As final safeguards, assure your 
roommate that you will not be bring-
ing anyone home the night of the 
party and that they absolutely, under 
no condition, should be prepared to 
leave the room. More bonus points if 
you can arrange for your roommate to 
engage the whole apartment in a new 
game called “Should I put hemorrhoid 
cream on that?”

If you’re still having trouble dis-
suading a fellow party participant 
from an impromptu sleepover, arrange 
a ride home with your parents in 
advance. This is especially effective if 
your parents are particularly nosy and 
will offer to let you and your “new 
friend” spend the night at your child-
hood home. 

Should all else fail, blatantly 
declare that you snore loudly and 
fart in your sleep, and then check in 
and see if your new acquaintance still 
insists on staying. 

If you follow our guide, you will 
most certainly never get laid and will 
spend the rest of your nights in soli-
tary glory.

GE Changes Do Little to Help Current Students

Effective immediately, stu-dents from Sixth, Revelle and Eleanor Roosevelt Colleges 
will see a number of college-specific 
general requirements knocked out 
of their degree audits, decreasing the 
total amount of courses they’ll need to 
complete before graduation. Say good-
bye to ERC’s additional “non-western” 
fine arts requirement, farewell to 
Sixth’s ethical and social context area 
requirement and adieu to Revelle’s 
three-course focus requirement.

Unfortunately, our excitement 
about the changes wore off as soon 
as we found out that Sixth will finally 
now allow an unlimited amount of 
Advanced Placement course credits 
to count for GE requirements, at a 
time much too late for upperclassmen 
to take advantage of. Cheated out of 
both money and hours spent on these 
classes, these students will also find 
out that their struggles identifying 
different mudras and Bodhisattvas in 
Introduction to Asian Art will sadly 
only result in an excess of elective 
credits they don’t really need. 

It’s clear that college administra-
tors had good intentions; these college 
requirement changes will serve as a 

benefit to UCSD students in the long 
run and will have the opportunity to 
significantly impact our university’s 
numbers for four-year graduation 
rates in the future. But a large major-
ity of currently enrolled students 
will be disappointed to see little to 
no change in their comprehensive 
four-year plans or their projected 
graduation date. Incoming freshmen 
and continuing students who have put 
off unexciting college requirements 
will be the only groups of enrolled 
students to benefit from these changes 
and ironically, students who have 
followed most college counselors’ sug-
gestion to complete general education 
courses first will be the ones getting 
the short end of the stick. 

Students with upper division 
standing who have already completed 
their general education requirements 
will reap no benefits. And this large 
majority of enrolled students most 
likely feels that they spent thousands 
of dollars spent on classes they were 
forced to take, rather than courses 
they would have chosen for them-
selves. Following advisors’ recom-
mendations to take general education 
classes during their first few years of 

college has turned into seeing classes 
that were formerly required for gradu-
ation turn into superfluous elective 
credits — an unfair punishment for 
the students who listened to counsel-
ors’ advice to plan ahead.

ERC is attempting to offer some 
flexibility by allowing its students to 
use their former fine art requirement 
to fulfill a lower division Regional 
Specialization requirement but only 
if it is appropriate for their region of 
choice. Though this was considerate, 
the option is still useless to ERC stu-
dents who already took a lower divi-
sion Regional Specialization class to 
work toward completing that specific 
requirement. And depending on the 
individual student’s choice of major 
and minor, some will still find no use 
for the elective credits added to their 
degree audit. 

We’re glad that future classes 
of UCSD students will have fewer 
requirements while gaining more 
course scheduling freedom and flex-
ibility. But college administrators 
should consider throwing continuing 
Roosevelt, Sixth and Revelle students 
a bone. After all, we just want to 
graduate too.

EDITORIAL BOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice 
a week at the University of California 

at San Diego. Contents © 2014. Views 
expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not 
necessarily those of the UC Board of 

Regents, the ASUCSD or the members 
of the Guardian staff. 

The University of California’s leadership is fairly open about its desire to rank among the top universities in the country. The UC Office of the President made that clear last month by up-
ping chancellor salaries around the system by up to 20 percent, all in 
the name of improving competition with the Stanfords and Yales of the 
top 25 schools.

That decision came at a point when higher education accessibility 
for California residents remains largely in jeopardy. Next month’s UC 
Board of Regents meeting will likely yield the first tuition increases 
that UC students have seen in three years. At the same time, many 
California high school students preparing to submit applications to 
our nine-campus system are seeing the highest levels of out-of-state 
competition in the UC system’s history.

Thus, California students are now facing heightened competition 
for admission and higher costs for attendance once they get in — nei-
ther of which supports the endgame of an “accessible” UC system. The 
solution to both issues, however, may in fact lie in not only slowing the 
growth of the non-Californian enrollment numbers, but also initially 
passing along tuition increases to the out-of-state students.

Enrollment numbers for non-residents have spiked in recent years 

— perhaps to help address growing budgetary concerns brought on 
by cuts and funding discontinuation at the state level. UC Berkeley 
currently has the highest saturation of non-resident students, allotting 
a whopping 17.2 percent of seats. On the same note, nearly a quarter of 
matriculations at UCSD are international students — who also pay the 
inflated supplemental tuition.

While we certainly value the diversity and pluralism we achieve 
with the large numbers of international and out-of-state students, 
it’s important to evaluate future overarching admissions protocols in 
the context of the California Master Plan for higher education. With 
California residents seemingly taking a back seat to out-of-state and 
international students, the time is right for UC administrators to limit 
numbers of those students and prioritize in-state residents who pay 
state taxes for admission.

Capping the trend of enrolling more and more non-resident stu-
dents is only half the battle. Once admitted and enrolled, the entering 
class of Fall Quarter 2015 is likely looking at a larger sticker price than 
what current students pay. To ensure that students who make the cut 
can afford to enroll on UC campuses, tuition needs to be kept at bay. 
With impending cuts to per-student spending paired with the untimely 



decision to increase administrator 
pay, we will soon be told that tuition 
increases are the only solution. A fair 
compromise would be to pass along 
the higher costs to out-of-state stu-
dents whose families are not already 
supplementing the UC system with 
tax revenue.

Out-of-state students are already 
cash cows for budget coordinators 
at UC schools. Supplemental tuition 
paid by non-California residents 
brings in an additional $22,878 per 
student for essentially the same uni-
versity experience as a student born 
and raised in the Golden State.

Higher out-of-state tuition, in-
stead of across-the-board increases, 

will also help slow the growth of 
non-resident students. The estimated 
cost of attendance for UCSD for a 
non-resident is still a bargain when 
pitted against the sticker price of 
comparable private schools like New 
York University. According to the 
most recent data available, a prospec-
tive student from any of the other 
49 states is looking at a $52,404 for 
tuition, fees and expenses at UCSD, 
while the same student could expect 
to dish out $72,577 as an arts and sci-
ences student at NYU.

Even the more local Univer-
sity of Southern California sets 
back undergraduates a whopping 
$64,761 in total costs. A modest 
raise on out-of-state tuition will not 
necessarily eliminate UC campuses 

as potential destination schools 
for out-of-staters. But at the same 
time, such increases may keep the 
non-resident population under 
control while also boosting the UC 
checking account with some much-
needed additional revenue.

 Tuition increases on any UC 
student is always a setback to the goal 
of accessible education. But when 
push comes to shove, the regents’ 
word is generally the final one, and the 
stench of not-so-distant tuition hikes 
has already spread across the state. 
In anticipation of higher fees on the 
horizon, we can only hope that acces-
sibility to the UC system for California 
residents is prioritized and that tuition 
increases, if any, will affect out-of-state 
students first.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
My name is Avi Oved. I am a 

student at UCLA. I am an econom-
ics major. I am a senior. I am the 
student regent-designate of the UC 
Board of Regents. And I am Jewish.

Prior to my appointment as your 
student regent-designate, some 
members of the UC community 
raised concerns about my ability to 
be an effective leader. I was called 
upon by many of these students 
to answer for my conduct, for my 
past work as the internal vice presi-
dent of the UCLA Undergraduate 
Student Association Council and 
for my personal beliefs. With the 
tumult of this summer and my 
confirmation by the UC  Regents 
behind us, I am taking this oppor-
tunity to answer.

In the months and weeks pre-
ceding my appointment, there were 
many conversations that took place 
about my history of work and ser-
vice in student government. Some 
of these conversations were heated, 
and some of these conversations 
took place on social media.

The technology that we have at 
our disposal, and at our fingertips, 
is both a gift and a responsibility; 
comments made in the heat of the 
moment may not be withdrawn. 
They may not be redacted. They are 
burned into the consciousness of all 
who see and read them.

Some of the comments that 
emerged in those conversations 
carried with them an undercurrent 
of intolerance and ignorance. It is 
statements like these, filled with 
ugly sentiment and ill feelings that 
I wish to acknowledge and to con-
demn.

I am Jewish, and I am pro-
Israel. I have never felt the need 

to hide my heritage or my beliefs. 
However, I cannot sit idly by and 
allow my culture to be conflated 
with ideas and viewpoints that I do 
not ascribe to. I find all forms of 
hate speech repugnant. Any impli-
cation that I feel otherwise because 
of statements made by others, or 
because I embrace my cultural heri-
tage, is an irresponsible one.

With that said, I want to stress 
that while I do identify with certain 
groups and a certain culture, those 
aspects are part of my persona, 
but not a part of my platform. As 
your student regent-designate, I 
am committed to listening to and 
advocating on behalf of all stu-
dents, regardless of background or 
belief.

I consider myself fortunate to 
be in a position from which I am 
able to advocate for my peers, and 
I mean to make the most out of my 
time as your student regent-desig-
nate. During my tenure, I want to 
focus on a number of key issues, 
including sexual violence preven-
tion, mental health awareness and 
increased student representation on 
the UC Regents. In addition, I want 
to centralize this office’s advocacy 
efforts with other tiers of higher 
education.

In the meantime, I want to reit-
erate something Student Regent 
Sadia Saifuddin and I spoke about 
following my appointment. Hateful 
invective and bigotry will never 
give way to productive discourse 
and dialogue. Personal views and 
beliefs aside, I am confident that 
the common ground I share with 
you, the students of this great uni-
versity, will yield an immensely 
productive term as your student 
regent, and I look forward to serv-
ing you.

-Avi Oved 
UC Student Regent-Designate

“psycho”
“Psycho” is the quintessential horror film, 

blessed by a pulse-pounding score and the 
most disturbed of hotel proprietors, Nor-
man Bates. “Master of Suspense” Alfred 
Hitchcock made this eerie nail-biter into a 
cultural phenomenon for the ages.

Staff Writer

“the shining”
Directed by Stanley Kubrick, “The Shining” comes 

with a truly unnerving performance by Jack Nicholson, 
highlighted by jarring camera angles and an unsettling 
musical score comprised of musicians abusing stringed 
instruments. Because of its deviation from common 
horror plots, “The Shining” has spurred several iconic 
scenes, including one containing the movie’s eerie 
mantra: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.”

- Kyle Somers
A&E Associate Editor 

“the conjuring”
“The Conjuring” breaks no rules and puts no 

twists on the tired genre of haunted houses, but it 
does offer a genuinely frightening experience that 
thrives on an unnerving atmosphere, effective and 
well-rationed jump scares and enthusiastic perfor-
mances by a diverse cast.

Keep the lights on, we’ve got more scares.

“the cabin in the woods”
A sharp satire on modern slasher films, “The Cabin in the 

Woods” still manages to scare consistently without under-
mining the overall satirical message. The last third of the film 
features particularly nightmarish visuals, and this Joss Whedon 
production balances horror with occasional comedic levity to 
keep the feel of the film as entertaining as it is terrifying.

unrest to Southern racism.

If you’re itching for a more interactive Halloween experience, venture to the Del Mar Fair-

grounds for The Scream Zone, an entire festival dedicated to making your hairs stand on end. 
Enter The Chamber and lose yourself in a maze of terror, or hop into The Haunted Hayride (but 
brace yourself for a plethora of clowns). This spooky corridor is home to the Zombie Paintball Sa-
fari and The Walking Dead Prison, both of which will give you a sneak preview of that apocalypse 
you’ve been waiting for. Sick of sitting on the sidelines every Halloween? Grab your gang and take 
a shot at this wicked game of terror.

trick-or-treat :  gaslamp
By the month of October, all of the summer tourists have left San Diego, and the Gaslamp 

Quarter becomes flooded with demons, witches and ghouls looking for one of the biggest parties 
in Southern California. On Halloween night, the only place to be is the San Diego Monster Bash. 
A ticket to this event opens the doors to every A-list bar and five live music stages. Everyone will 
be dressed up in their best costumes, hoping to win the $5,000 costume contest at the bash. Un-
fortunately, this is a 21 and older event, but that doesn’t end the fun that downtown can provide 
for Halloween. The Gaslamp also has the scariest haunted houses such as “The Haunted Hotel,” 
which welcomes the bravest to come in to try its dark and twisted maze full of chainsaws, clowns 
and other creatures of the night. If you want to get your heart pumping or you’re just looking for 
a good time, head to the Gaslamp to celebrate Halloween in a way unlike ever before.

HEALTHY PERSON?

When Lou Bloom explodes in a 
brief fit of rage — violently shaking 
and shattering his bathroom mirror 
— in Dan Gilroy’s black-comedy 
thriller, “Nightcrawler,” the moment 
is uncharacteristic, terrifying and 
telling. Indeed, the oily-haired 
antihero rarely ever expresses 
believably human emotions, but 
beneath the creepy, candied smile 
he flashes throughout the film exists 
the monster that we truly catch a 
glimpse of in that shaken reflection 

of broken glass.
Lou, played brilliantly by Jake 

Gyllenhaal, is a gaunt loner who 
scours the streets of Los Angeles 
at night as a petty thief in Gilroy’s 
directorial debut. He is cheerful 
and polite — too much, as we 
slowly realize — but cannot seem 
to find a stable job despite his 
practiced efforts to sell himself as 
a diligent worker. Soon enough, he 
happens to witness the immediate 
aftermath of a fiery car crash and 

is suddenly sucked into the world 
of nightcrawling — the high-
speed profession of tracking down 
graphic automobile accidents and 
bloody crime scenes and capturing 
them on video to sell to local news 
stations.

The follow-up is a chronicle of Lou’s 
rise in his new profitable venture, 
which simultaneously serves to 
unravel the very amoral and unsettling 
nature of the film’s protagonist. As Lou 
finds more success partnering up with 
a misfortunate lackey (Riz Ahmed) 
and making deals with a local news 
director (Rene Russo), who is shady 
in her own right, he goes beyond 
the extra mile to get the video shot 
— he begins to tamper with the 
crime scenes themselves. In between 
are showcases of Lou’s delightfully 
disturbing behavior, as Gilroy 
constructs Lou in such ridiculous 
terms that the protagonist’s oddities 
and the unnatural exchanges he 
has with others have the dual effect 

of hilarity and horror. At its heart, 
“Nightcrawler” is a twisted and 
sardonic portrait of a sociopath, 
with each sickly detail gradually 
rendered from the ethical tailspin 
that is Lou’s budding career.

Gilroy (screenwriter for “Two for 
the Money”), who also penned the 
screenplay, proves himself to be a 
capable auteur, tackling a unique 
narrative and crafting an equally 
funny and horrifying character 
study. Paired with the capable 
eye of cinematographer Robert 
Elswit (“Magnolia,” “There Will Be 
Blood”), Gilroy manages to create 
an entertaining and frightening 
impression of a serial killer out of 
the man documenting the crimes 
rather than committing them. 

However, the true star, of course, 
is Gyllenhaal in what is the finest 
performance of an impressive 
career. Shedding 30 pounds for 
the role, Gyllenhaal quickly erases 
the memory of his typically suave 

and handsome appearance as he 
completely immerses himself in the 
role, looking emaciated and acting 
insane. Gyllenhaal finds the perfect 
balance of the nuanced character, 
masking Lou’s unhinged nature in 
an artificial grin while constantly 
communicating in language that 
seems lifted from the salesman 
script of a personal empowerment 
seminar. The result is a man whose 
eeriness makes us laugh but always 
with a tinge of discomfort and 
nervousness. 

“Nightcrawler” is thrilling, darkly 
funny and disturbing and driven 
by one of the most engrossing 
characters in cinema’s recent years. 
Lou Bloom is a monster, an alien, an 
enigma, an American psycho.

 “I’m a quick learner,” Lou echoes 
throughout the film and we can only 
fear how true that may be.

equalize with their first score, setting 
off a chain of scores during the frenzied 
final minutes of the match. In the 81st 
minute, Bauman’s free kick was redi-
rected by sophomore midfielder Riley 
Harbour into the path of sophomore 
defender Kuba Waligorski, who netted 
his second of the season.

The equalizer was quickly eradi-
cated nearly six minutes later when 
substitute junior forward Chris Pitts 
skillfully lobbed the ball over the ad-
vancing McElfresh to regain the lead 
for the Torres.

However, the drama continued as 
UCSD capitalized on a man advantage 
after Humboldt’s Connor received a 
second yellow card. The Tritons con-
structed a near-replica of their first 
goal, as Harbour again redirected a free 
kick from Bauman to tee up Uly de la 
Cal for his first goal of the season. The 
clutch strike brought the game at a 2–2 
standstill in the 89th minute of play. 

“Humboldt is a very tough school 
to play,” Pascale said. “They had a 
pretty good team and a pretty rowdy 
crowd. Our backs were up against 
the wall [for] a lot of that game, so I 
give the guys a ton of credit for just 

sticking with it and coming away 
with a good result.’

The weekend’s results leave UCSD 
9–4–4 overall on the season and 
4–2–4 in the conference. The Tritons 
now sit in fourth in league standings, 
safely within the postseason qualifying 
bracket of the top six teams. 

After four games on the road, the 
Tritons return home on Thursday, Oct. 
30, to face Cal State Dominguez Hills 
in the final game of the regular season. 
With a draw, UCSD will clinch a play-
off berth in the California Collegiate 

Athletics Association Championship, 
while a win would ensure a home field 
advantage in the first round of the 
postseason tournament. 

“Both teams need to win,” Pas-
cale told the UCSD Guardian. 
“Dominguez is a really good team. 
Every year, they’re one of the top 
teams so it will be great to play them 
at home and hopefully have a great 
performance.”

Crew Will Race in San Diego Fall Classic to Conclude Fall Season 

fashion, finishing first in 12:57 with 
a comfortable seven second lead. 
Orange Coast again came in sec-
ond (13:04) while UCLA finished at 
third (13:07).

The women’s crew faced tougher 
competition but was still able to place 
third in the Open 4 with a finishing 
time of 15:17, behind the two boats of 
San Diego State (14:19, 14:23).

For the women’s Open 8, it was 

again San Diego State University 
that came out on top, with a time 
of 12:42. The Tritons, on the other 
hand, had three boats, finishing 
sixth (13:40) seventh (13:42) and 
ninth (14:33). 

“It was a great team effort today,” 
UCSD head women’s coach Colin 
Truex said. “All boats rowed very ag-
gressively and attacked the race while 
at the same time maintaining their 
composure in the heat of competition.”

UCSD is not back in action un-

til Nov. 9 when the team returns to 
Mission Bay for the annual San Di-
ego Fall Classic, which will be the 
last time the Tritons will hit the wa-
ter until March 2015. UCSD hopes 
to build on its successful outing last 
year at the Fall Classic, during which 
the men placed first in the Open 8+ 
and the Open Novice 8+.

SPORTS  CLUBS

Field Hockey: In its second home game of the season, the UCSD Club Field 
Hockey team took on the Serpents of Claremont McKenna College. UCSD 
took an early lead and played well to finish with 9 goals. Taylor Howell and 
Mitchell Keith scored three goals each. The remaining three goals were 
scored by Zoe Montoya, Tace Higuchi and Lindsay Sager. On Sunday, the 
Tritons faced off against the University of Southern California for the second 
time during league play. The Tritons struck first, with Montoya tipping in 
a goal. The Trojans responded quickly with an equalizer. By halftime, both 
teams secured one more goal apiece before UCSD’s Keith scored one more to 
tie the game at two. In the second half, the Trojans scored again, but UCSD’s 
Sagar answered quickly with a strong drive from the top of the circle. At 
the end of regulation, the game was still tied and a shootout ensued. UCSD 
goalkeeper Lori Pope made some amazing saves, but the Trojans ultimately 
took the victory. Despite the loss, the game was an exciting way to conclude 
the Tritons last home game.

Women’s Rugby: The UCSD women’s rugby team suffered a tough loss in a 
preseason game against the San Diego Surfers Women’s Rugby Club (B side) 
this past Sunday. With the absence of several veteran players, the Tritons 
had to rely on the less experienced members of their team. It was a rocky 
match from start to end. The Triton women  were not able to score a try in 
the full 80 minutes of play despite reaching beyond the Surfer’s 22-meter 
line multiple times. The girls lacked in size and experience, and it did show 
during the game. In two weeks, the Tritons will host the annual Scrum by the 
Sea Tournament which consists of a full, two days of rugby games featuring 
16 teams to be played on Warren Field. 

Roller Hockey: In the first WCRHL tournament of the year, the UCSD 
roller hockey team swept the weekend against UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, 
Sonoma State and Chico State. In the first game UCSD faced off against UC 
Irvine, who came out strong but were quickly rebuffed. After three periods of 
tense back-and-forth play, Grant Marcy scored his first collegiate goal to tie 
the game. The resulting shootout gave UCSD the win. The second game that 
same night saw UCSD battle Chico State in another competitive game. Marcy 
and Kevin Zhang fought back to end the game at 6-3. The next morning, the 
2-0 Tritons played an early game against 0-2 Sonoma State. UCSD kept the 
pressure up through the second period, racking up 10 goals to SSU’s one to 
give UCSD the win. In the last game of the tournament, UCSD went head-
to-head against UC Berkeley. With strong performances by Chang and Fong, 
UCSD led early with 10-0 in the third period and would ultimately take its 
fourth win of the weekend at 10-2.

Tritons Take Control of  Playoff  Fate
WOMEN'S  SOCCER 

Two clutch shutout victories raise UCSD into postseason position with one game remaining.
BY JOHN STORY ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR // PHOTO BY MEGAN LEE

Heading into the crucial stretches of the season, the UCSD women’s 
soccer tallied two important victories on the road this past weekend, 
improving their record to 8–5–3 overall and 5–3–2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. The Tritons bested No. 15 Sonoma 
State in a 1–0 match on Friday and repeated a 1–0 performance over 
Humboldt State on Sunday.

Coming off the two in-conference wins, UCSD moved up in CCAA 
placement over Cal State Stanislaus, seizing sole possession of the sixth 
spot in the 12 team standings. With only six teams allowed for qualifica-
tion for the conference championship, the Tritons have a slim one-point 
advantage over Cal State Stanislaus in standings, with one final regular 
season game remaining. 

On Friday, Sonoma State threatened multiple times in the first half, 
first with a right-sided cross at the 12-minute mark that was diffused 
by freshman midfielder Aimee Ellis, followed by a free kick on the 
right side in the 27th minute. Ultimately, neither side produced much 
in terms of opportunities until senior forward Izzy Pozurama’s season-
saving kick on an offensive drive in the 83rd minute.

“[Junior midfielder Maile Nilsson] played a great ball over the top, 
and [Pozurama] beat the goalkeeper to the ball and lobbed it over 
her,” UCSD head coach Brian McManus told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “It was a fantastic effort. She got just enough on it to clear 
the keeper and get it to the goal before the defenders got there to clear 
it off.”

On Sunday, the Tritons maintained their stout defense while 
Pozurama struck the net in the 56th minute of play with assistance from 
freshman midfielder Jordyn McNutt to ultimately complete the perfect 
road weekend.

This season looks to be a promising one for Pozurama, for four of 
her five goals in 2014 have decided game outcomes. Not to be over-
looked are the contributions of players like McNutt and the defensive 
side of play that has not allowed a goal in an amazing four straight 
games of play. As the postseason rapidly approaches, UCSD finds itself 
playing some of its best soccer. 

“We talked about every one of these last five games being like a play-
off game, and I think we’ve responded great,” McManus said. “It would 
have been easy to lie down, but we’ve responded great.” 

Senior Night is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 29 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium against in-conference rival Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. Triton seniors Pozurama and midfielders Cassie Callahan, Kylie 
Hill and Kelly Leshin will be recognized prior to kickoff. 

“The attitudes are right, and our players have risen to the chal-
lenge,” McManus said. “We’ve still got two games to go, but we’ve 
given ourselves a chance. We need to win those two and hopefully 
get a little help.”

MEN'S SOCCER

UCSD on Brink of  Postseason Berth
Tritons record two straight draws, need tie or win in final game to clinch berth. 

Facing off against two difficult 
in-league fixtures, the UCSD men’s 
soccer team concluded the weekend 
with respectable results. The Tritons 
matched evenly with both their op-
ponents, drawing 1–1 with Sonoma 
State University on Friday and 2–2 
with Humboldt State University on 
Sunday to put them on the brink of a 
postseason berth.

The Tritons opted to start Friday’s 
contest at Seawolf Soccer Field with 
inexperience up front as freshman 
striker Uly de la Cal made his first 
collegiate start alongside sophomore 
forward Sam Palano. Fellow fresh-
man and winger Sean Pleskow slotted 
home for his third goal of the season in 
the 27th minute to put UCSD up 1–0. 
Senior midfielder Brandon Bauman 
aided Pleskow for his team-leading 
seventh assist of the season.

However, the lead lasted a little over 
10 minutes as the Seawolves struck 
back with a penalty from sophomore 
forward Cedric Didane in the 38th 
minute of play. Both squads concluded 
the first half with the 1–1 score that 
would remain unchanged for the re-
mainder of the match. 

The second half proved to be a 
relatively dull affair, with both teams 
exchanging four shots between them. 

Extra time failed to produce a win 
for either side, though both bordered 
on success multiple times. Freshman 
midfielder Zachary Lagotta came close 
for the Tritons with a skillful solo run 
that ultimately failed to produce a fin-
ish. While Sonoma State had two late 
crossing opportunities, junior goal-
keeper Cameron McElfresh dealt with 
them easily. 

“Our guys fought really hard, and 
it was a great team effort,” UCSD head 
coach Jon Pascale told the UCSD Ath-
letics Department. “Everybody pitched 
in and did their job and we [ground] 
our way through it. I give the guys a lot 

of credit for hanging in there.”
UCSD’s game at College Creek 

Field against Humboldt State Universi-
ty on Sunday was a hugely contentious 
game which featured a whopping 46 
fouls, eight yellow cards and a red card 
for the home side.

It was Humboldt State University 
which drew first blood on the score-
board when junior forward Ryan Con-
nor headed the ball in from a corner 
with 28 minutes gone.

It was not until the end of the sec-
ond half that the Tritons managed to

Tritons Row for the Cure
UCSD hosts annual charity regatta for breast cancer.

The UCSD men’s and women’s 
crew squads had a solid outing in 
Mission Bay this past Sunday at the 
14th annual Row for the Cure, a char-
ity regatta dedicated to raising funds 
for the fight against breast cancer. 

For the UCSD crew program, 
the Row for the Cure event marks 
the start of the 2013–14 season. The 
Tritons hosted Loyola Marymount 
University, Orange Coast College, 
San Diego State University, UCLA 
and UCSD.

The UCSD men emerged victo-
rious in both of their races for the 
day, taking first place in the Open 8 

and the Open 4 in dominating fash-
ion. The Tritons crossed the finish 
line for the Open 8 at 11:43. Second 
place Orange Coast College (11:51) 
followed eight seconds behind while 
the two UCLA boats placed in third 
and fourth, at 11:55 and 13:09, re-
spectively.

“I’m just really proud of the guys,” 
UCSD head men’s coach Zach John-
son told the UCSD Athletics Depart-
ment. “We have been working hard, 
and this was the first day with that 
lineup. They really stepped up and 
executed well.”

UCSD was able to make the 
podium for the Open 4 in similar
