Reg Fee 
wants legal 

• servIces cut 
Lawyer's stall out, 
USD interns in 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
The Registration Fee 

Committee believes it can 
save about ~40,OOO if UCSD 
Legal Services are reformed, 
but it is having a hard time 
convincing Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Rich"rd 
Annitage of the savings. 

The Committee's proposal , 
which ca11s for replacement 
of the present system with a 
contracted legal clinic from 
the University of San Diego 
School of Law, was rejected 
once by Armitage last May. 

The present system, 
costing $58,950 annually, is 
headed by ca.mpus attorney 
Nick Aguilar, and provides 
advice and referral to 
students and student 
organizations during school 
hours. It does not provide 
representation in court. 

~h~ proposed USD Legal 
Chnlc would provide 
~nsultation of five legal 
tOtems under the supervi-
sion of a licensed attorney on 
3 evenings each week for 3 
hour blocks of time. In 
addition, the interns could 
often represent students in 
court, especially in landlord-
tenant cases which are the 
most common of problems 

brou~ht to Aguilar's unit. 
Reg Fee chairman, Cathy , 

Valerio, said the new 
program would reduce costs 
to a lump sum of $15,000 to 
$20,000. "The Vice Chancel-
lor never gave l'\ny reason for 
not approving our (last 
year's) recommendation," 
but she speculated that 
Armitage refused the plan 
because it would have 
involved the firing of a high-
paid minority, and might 
have reduced the quality of 
services. 

In retrospect, Armitage 
said, "I didn't think the 
committee or any other entity 
spend sufficient ·time 
studying in depth the 
operation and alternatives." 
Furthermore, he added that 
Aguilar "is a very able young 
aaministrator with a deep, 
deep commitment and 
interest in UCSD. 

"His expertise, his 
character, his experience as a 
successful young profes-
sional Chicano admmistra-
tor, his relations with the 
San Diego community as a 
representative of this 
University, his potential as a 
member pf this University in 
other roles besides legal 
affairs, his counseling of 
students and-particularly in 
major affirmative action 
committees provides mature, 
level-headed judgement that 
is needed nowadays as we 
increasingly seek to increase 
the number of successful 
minority students," Armi· 
tage continued.

AS, KSDT 
sign deal 
for aid 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
Staff Writer 

The AS and KSDT came to 
a final agreement on KDST's 
contract at last week's AS 
meeting. 

The contract, which spells 
out KSDT's obligations to 
the AS in return for financial 
support during the 1981 
school year, was signed 
yesterday by the AS 
president and vice-president, 
and the KSDT Board of 
Directors. 

KSDT has 'run the station 
all year according to the 
principles of the contract, 
which was drawn up last 
summer. The contnct 
actually was approved last 
fall, and the AS 1~81 
budget was approved with 
$7500 alloted for KSDT's use. 

Tlte main points of the 
contract are: 

-KSDT must work 
towards self-sufficiency. The 
contract stipulates deadlines 
that KSOT must meet in 
obtainin~ advertising 
revenues. (The station has 
met the first deadline, 
according to KSDT General 
Manager Jodi Sandven). 

-"KSDTshall provide full 
radio 'COverage of the VCSD 
campus by the end of winter 
quarter 1981." 

-$7500 shall become 
available to KSDT upon the 
approval and signing of the 
contract. 

-In return for the 1980-81 
allocation and all past 
allocations, KSDT shall 
provide the VCSD students , 
through the AS, airtime each 
week, including: ten 60 
second spots each week, to be 
used by students at the 
discretion of the AS council; 
two two-minute news pots 
each day for campus news; a 
weekly 30 minute "ASVCSD 
Forum on the Air"; two

were placed on the future 
operation of KSDT, with the

Attempted 
rape at 
UEO office 
Assailant flees 

BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 
Staff Writer 

In one of two possibly 
related cases , a woman 
working in the University 
Events Office last Friday was 
the victim of an attempted 
rape. 

The woman, who asked to 
remain anonymous, told the 
Campus Police that she was 
in the office talking on the 
phone at about 5 pm when 
she was attacked . 

A man, described as a 
white male about 25 years 
old, 6 feet tall, 150 pounds, 
with brown hair, poked his 
head through the doorway 
and asked the woman if UEO 
was open. She replied that it 
was not, hung up the phone 
and went to lock the door. 

But the man came back 
naked and grabbed the 
woman by the throat. The 
woman screamed and fought 
him off. He made ~everal 
obscene comments, then 
retreated and disappeared . 

The report had originally 
been written up as a battery, 
but will . be changed and 
relabeled as an attempted 
rape according to Campus 
Police Detective Bob Jones. 
Investigation has been 
delayed pending that charge. 

Once the change is made, 
campus police plan to review 
talks with people who have 
been "questioned for various 
reasons" in the past, Jones 
said. Police will then examine 
past reports to check for 
similari ties between the 
descriptions of the suspect 
for thiS case and of suspects 
from previous cases. 

The second case involves a 
man, de~jbed as 5'9" with a 
thin build, who walked into a 
women's suite in Tenaya 
Hall at about 2 pm last 
'Saturday. The man was 
reported to have undressed 
himself and sat on a woman's 
bed. He left without incident, 
however, and the police are 
now investigating a possible 
connection between the two 
cases.

AS allocates funds

Ignores UjS appeal, large petition 

BY JENIFER WARREN

The Union of Jewish 
Students says it doesn't care 
if a terrorist dedicated to the 
destruction of Israel speaks 
on campus - as long as their 
money isn't used to fund his 
appearance. 

But the Associated 
Students, which argues the 
speech of Pales.tinian 
Liberation Organization _ 
representative Hatem 1. 
Hussaini will be an 
"educational cxp~!,!ence," 
has appropriated $300 for his

The campus Organization 
of Arab Students is 
sponsoring the appearance of

of the United States PLO

VJS spokeswoman Michele

Academic Senate chairma~ responds 
Editor: 

I regret your editorial 
decision to deny my r81uest 
to print the statement to the 
students in its entirety. In 
your excerpts. 'you made 
three important omissions: 

A - "For those who are 
concerned with CEP's more 
gen~al deliberations on the 
current regulation governing 
the grade, I want to reassure 
you that CEP has a tradition 
of extensive student 
consultation. The two 
student representatives 
serve to convey student 
opinions, and we seek direct 
input when a case is of great 
import to the students. The 
most r.ecent exampl~ was t~e 

recommendation on the 
procedures to be followed in 
the case of suspected 
academic dishonesty: A draft 
report of our recommenda-
tions was sent to the 
Associated Students, the 
College Councils and the then 
Daily Guardian. The 
responses from the two 
interested College Councils 
were valued by CEP. In the 
present case, I shall be glad to 
propose to CEP to hold an 
open hearing, to which all 
interested students can come 
and exchange ideas on the I 
grades with the committee. I 
can promise you that 
students will be consulted on 
the final draft of our 

recommendation not the 
implementation of the 
.current I policy before 
submission to the senate." 
This paragraph may be of 
interest to students who 
would like to voice their 
opinions to CEP. Without it, 
the statement in the 
following paragraph refer-
ring to "my proposals above" 
becomes misleading. 

B - "The chair of CEP, in 
vieYf of the pa!1sage of 
motIons 
1- that CEP considers the 

issue based on its interpreta-
tion of policy whether a ' 
particular sequence of 
actions were or were not in 
accordance with Regulations. 

and that CEP's recommenda-
tion based Qn its interpretll-
tion be transmitted to the 
Divisional Senate and to the 
enquiring Provost; 

. 2 - that the Committee 
makes its findings on two 
levels simultaneously 

i-observe the written 
Regulations and determine 
whether the case was 
handled in accordance with 
the letter of the Regulations 

ii - assess this case 
relative 'to the established 
practice on this campus, 
estabHshing whether it is 
common practice for 
instructors to abuse the 
clerical error forms and 
assign. grades long after Is 

have lapsed into Fs; 
rules that the pres ent 
meeting will deal with 
matters of a confidential 
nature and that the first 
portion of the meeting must, 
therefore, be closed." 

This paragraph, by citing 
the exact wording of CEP 
motions, may help to clarify 
the confusion in your articles 
over the CEP actions. It also 
forms the basis of the CEP 
chair's ruling to close the 
meeting.

to counsel you against 'rash

Let's not forget Prof. Tolbert tPoetry Wars' review. 
a tquick slander' Editor: 

UCSD.'s administration I 
is on trial! Amid its emp'ty 
rhetoric about "trying to 
comply" with affirmative 
action guidelines, its new 
chancellor who pledges his 
support to hiring more Third 
World faculty, its report from 
Provost Joe Watson, which 
outlines the gross inadequa-
cies of this campus when it 
comes to meeting the needs of 
Third World peoples, and its 
failure to acknowledJJe 
student input and interest In 
matters that concern them, 
there stiU has been no action 
on the part of the administra-
tion to correct an~ of these . 
problems! Its guilt IS evident! 

However, many would 
dismiss these issues as being 
irrelevant, after all, "Racism 
doesn't exist anymore." 
Others believe that these 
issues, particularl, the 
systematic exclusion 0 Black 
people from institutions such 
as UCSD, is something 
unique to the 60s, but not 
really existent today. Well, 
for them and everyone else at 
UCSD, I would like to present 
a case that burns at the heart 
of all these issues: the case of 
Dr. Emory Tolbert_ 

Dr. Tolbert, . a Black 
professor here at the 
university. teaches African-
American history, and is 
presently up for tenure 
review before the History 
Department. Many might not 

~Iieve that whether or not 
Dr. Tolbert receives tenure is 
a political issue Or that it 
should be held up for public 
scrutiny, but those familiar 
with the tenure process know 
the injustices that go on 
behind its closed doors. If this 
secretive and su bject ive 
exercise isn't exposed, then it 
gives the department - the 
History Department in this 
case - a free hand to carry 
out any unjust plot. 

Towards the end of last 
quarter, the then Daily 
Guardian published an 
article about the issue of Dr. 

Tolbert getting tenure, 
which pointed out some of the 
issues involved. I only want 
to further ' delineate the 
implications of this issue. 

During their bid for tenure, 
professors ar~ judged on 
teaching, community service 
and academic scholarship 
(research and publieations). 
In the areas of teaching and 
community service, Dr. 
Tolbert has alreadr been 
judged "outstanding' by the 
History Department and 
students, i.e_ CAPE reviews. 
However, when Dr. Tolbert 
w¥ denied tenure- by the 

His~ory Department , two 
years ago, their . reason for 
denial was his alleged 
"inadequate" academic 
scholarship. This alone 
illustrates the university's 
lack of concern for professors 
who can teach students. The 
fallacy that teaching and 
community service are given 
consideration in tenure 
review must be recognized. In 
this case, the department 
weigheCi academic scholar-
ship, one of three categories 
against two others, teaching 
and service to' the commu-
nity, and voted overwhelm-
ingly against Dr. Tolbert 
receiving tenure. 

Even if the History 
Department bases their 
decision solely on academic 
research, there can be no 
room for doubt, as far as Dr. 
Tolbert's qualification is 
concerned. Dr. Tolbert has 
proved himself more than 
qualified in the area of 
academic scholarship! 
During the time of his tirst 
review for tenure, Tolbert 's 
book, The ,UNJA and Black 
Los A ngeles, had been 
accepted for publication. For 
most professors this clearly 
would have been enough for a 

. tenured position. The 
University of California, Los 
Angeles' Center for Afro· 
American Studies published 
his book and it received 
excellent reviews by those 
familiar with the field of

The Great.Naropa Poetry . 

Wars may be a "good, quick 
read" but its review by Mr. 
Heimler (Guardian, Feb. 2) 
is a cheap, quick slander of a 
man who has done a few 
other things in the 11 years 
he has been in this country 
besides mistreating a poet. 
Honest inquiry into what 
Chogyam Trungpa, Rin-
poche has done in this time 
could probably reinforce 
indictments against him by 
either Marxists or the 
Moral Majority, but it 
would be very hard to see 
him doing harm to 
Buddhism. 

Perhaps, if one were to 
'read his books, listen to his 
lectures or meditate at one 
of his centers, then one 
would be in a position to 

evaluate his presentation of 
Buddhism. That is assum-
ing, of course, that one 
already has a general 
knowledge of the presenta-
tion of Buddhism in the 
West. 

The lesson of Jonestown 
and the danger of cults is 
real and should not be 
forgotten in any case. 
Chogyam Trungpa, Rin-
poche differs from the 
'leaders or organizations 
that could more properly be 
termed "cults" in that he is 
not a self-appointed leader

Watt: a man feared by man and nature 
DENVER - Ten years 

ago environmentalists were 
inspiring a nation to clean up 
the planet. Today, they're 
wondering what's happened 
to many of their followers . 

Most are laying low, for 
fear of incurring the wrath of 
new Interior Secretary James 
G. Watt . Many Americans 
may now understand why 
he's called " the apostle of 
pillage" - especially after 
his recent decision to release 
over one million acres of 
environmentally-sensitive 
California coastal waters to 
oil and gas interests. 

There have been compe-
ting descriptions of Watt. 
Some say he's simply a tool of 
development interests, while 
others suggest he's a man 
who follows his own 
principles. 

To many in this city, the 
former president of the 
Mountain States Legal 
Foundation represents those 

development interests who 
have turned a once·quaint 
Denver into a polluted , 
skyscrapered metropolis. He 
is identified with the boom 
towns and the strip mines. 

But others who know 
Watt 's private side talk not of 
brick and oil, but of Bibles 
and prayer meetings . If 
there's any monument toJim 
Watt, they say, it's the 
Aurora First Assembly of 
God, a Christian congrega-
tion in Denver's southern 
suburbs that believes in the 
literal interpretation of the 
Bible. 

When writing about Watt, 
the press has only fleetingly, 
called him "deeply religious. ' 
Yet, reporters have over-
looke4 Watt's belief that man 
was intended to subdue and 
profit from the earth in 
anticipation of eternal 
salvation. This credo is the 
compelling force beh ind 
Watt's professional per for-

mance and why he just 
doesn't understand envi-
ronmentalists. 

The son of a lawyer, Watt 
~ew up in Wheatland, Wyo., 
In an area in the southwes-
tern part of the state that 
resembles the moon. He was 
too wholesome for words, 
excelled in three sports at 
Wheatland High and 
graduated- at the top of his 
class. It was during high 
school that he began dating 
"Lani" Bomgardner, the 
young women he married in 
1957 while both were 
attending the University of 
Wyoming. 

In 1964, the Watts were 
living modest church-going 
lives in suburban Maryland. 
Jim was writing legislation 
and speeches for Wyoming 
Sen. Milward L. Simpson, 
who'd hired him out of law 
school to work on his 1962 
campaign. 

Although the circum-

stances are unclear, Jim and 
Lani were "born again" that 
year. They became "charis-
matic" Christians, the kind 
who are known to speak in 
tongues and believe them-
selves to be agents of God. 
Sen. Simpson's family also 
involved themselves in the 
Watts' ordeal. 

After their experience, the 
Watts devoted even more of 
their personal lives to God. 
During summers here they 
were known to attend revival 
and faith-healing camps. Few . 
in the business world know 
much about this side of Watt, 
who mixed work with leisure 
in his role as Mountain 
States' chief fundraiser. 

Undoubtedly Watt's 
charisrnaticdevelopmept had 
much to do with his 
professional behavior. He's 
been known to ask for silence 
at staff meetings, participate 
in local paryer groups and 
keep a Bible in his desk 

drawer. 
With this background, it's 

not surprising Watt practices 
what he believes the Bible 
says: keeping the "back 40" 
untilled is tantamount to 
sloth. 

To those weaned on the 
naturalist :views of Henry 
David Thoreau and Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, this biblical 
interpretation may seem bf( 
the wall. Yet, it helps to 
explain why Watt has been so 
persistently pro-development 
during his career - even 
when public opinion has been 
leaning in favor of preserva-
tion. 

It also explains Watt's 
religious advocacy of the 
"multi-use concept." The 
interior secretary looks at the 
earth as a potential 
Disneyland, with grazing 
lands, baseball fields and oil 
rigs coexisting happily side 
by side. He's not against

Registrar has a neW" \Vay 
to sign up for classes 

Registration cards come with class schedules 
BY JOHN HONDROS 

Staff Wriler 
The Registrar's Office has good news and 

bad news for returning UCSD students. 
The good news is that the processes of 

enrollment and registration will be simpler 
and faster for students. 

The bad news is that the new Schedule of 
Classes cost 25¢. 

The Office of Admissions and Registrar, 
which is in the initial process of implementing 
new local admissions and record keeping 
systems, is instituting new preferred 
enrollment procedures for Spring quarter. 

The new process involves producing local 
registration materials, part of a systemwide 
effort to decentralize UC's paperwork. In the 
past, UCLA did the record keeping for the 
southern UC campuses. 

The first change students will notice is that 
the Sprin~ quarter enrollment forms are 
contained 10 the Schedule of Classes, which 
sells for 25 cents in the bookstore and Revelle 
Sundry Store. 

These forms, like add/drop cards, are also 
'available at the Registrar's Office, Provost 
offices. graduate and department offices . 
Complete instructiens are on the form. 

After the students have enrolled, the 
remainder of the rejistration materials 
together with a confIrmation of official 
enrollment (study lists) will be distributed to 
undergrads from the Registrar's Office. 

The former reg packet, minus the preferred 
prOlVam card, will continue to be used for 
Sprtng'SI. 

Sally Hickok. associate registrar, says the 
office hopes by Fall quarter to design 
registration materials as one-page forms. 

Hickok says this new procedure will allow 
the Reiristrar to confirm class schedules in 
"half the time" that it previously took. 

The schedule for enrollment is as follows: 
Graduates - Feb. 20, 23, 24. 25; Seniors -
Feb. 20;Juniors - Feb. 23; Sophomores - Feb. 
24; Freshmen - Feb. 25. 

Reg Fee cODlntittee wants to 
revantp call1pus legal service 
continued from page 1 . 
attorney, Raphael Levens after Levens 
resigned from UCSD in 1979. He was 
exempted from affirmative action 
requirements because of his notable service 
with the Legal Aid Society, his prior 
employment as UCSD director of off-campus 
housing, and his legacy as a former UCSD 
student in developing Third College, MEChA, 
and the Educational Opportunity Pro~am. 

However, alerio feels that Aguilar s close 
ties with UCSD may be a hindrance. "Our 
lawyer cannot represent students in court and 
it's a conflict of interest for him to advise 
students in action against the University. The 
USD Clinic is a contracted entity; they 
wouldn't have a conflict of interest," she said. 

On the contrary, Aguilar sees his 
involvement with UCSD as an asset. 
"Because I am familiar (with UCSD) I am able 
to get involved in campus issues," he said. 

The interns "won't have the expertise" he 
explained. "Their main purpose is to provide a 
learning experience for law students." The-
clients he said "areused as a laboratory for the 
law students." He (urther contends that USD, 
a private institution is "aggressively" pushing 
the contract because they need to expand their 
funding sources. 

"Why is it that Legal Services are singled 
out?" asked Aguilar. "If Reg Fee is really 
interested in saving money, they should look 
to other programs like Counseling and 
Psychological Services, and like Health 
Services (which he claims takes about 40% of 
the Reg Fee budget). He then pointed out the

"miniscule" p!()~rtion of Legal Services 
expenditures ($58,950) to the total Reg Fee 
budget of $4.6 million annually. 

But compared to other UC campuses, Reg 
'Fee figures that UCSO 'spends considerably 
more on its legal services. 

According to a Reg Fee report issues last 
May, UCSD comprises only S.S percent of the 
total UC enrollment, but claims 42 percent of 
total expenditures for the services. 

ValerIO said that Reg Fee has reason to 
believe the plan may win Armitage's approval 
this time around: "The essential difference is 
that now Nick holds the position of Director of 
Community Related Services," she said. 
Because his duties have expanded to over" '!e 
off-campus housing, off-campus employment, 
and the Office of Religious Affairs, Aguilar's 
employment at UCSO is not necessarily 
threatened. . 

Aguilar, however, is uncertain whether he 
would stay at UCSD if Legal Services are 
dismantled. "I committed three years of my 
life to law school...1 would consider it a 
significant professional development," he 
said. 

Armitage said he will keep an "open mind" 
on ~he proposal "es~ially since this is the 

~nd time around. ' However, he expressed 
reservations against a "radical change" in 
Legal Services because he doesn't want to 
complicate matters for his successor when he 
retires in August. 

Valerio said the issue will be discussed at 
length at the Community Related Services 
meeting of the Reg Fee Committee on 
February 26.

York will speak on 
arms negotiation 

AS, KSI)T sign contract for 
aid ,to keep station running· 

Herbert York, a physicist and former UCSD chancellor, 
will discuss his experiences as a negotiator at the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty discussons 
during the next "Adventures in Research" lecture . . 

The lecture, titled "Negotiating with the Russians: A 
·Personal Experience," is scheduled ,for noon, Wednesday, 
Feb. 25, in conference room IllA in the Administrative 
Complex. The pu blic is welcome and admission' is free. 

York, who worked on t-he Manhattan Project to build the 
first atomic bomb during World War II, is an 
internationally recognized authority on the problems of 
nuclear disarmament. 

York was the first chancellor of UCSD, assuming that 
post in 19tH. He resigned for reasons of health in 1964 but 
remained as a professor of physics. He is currently director 
of the Science, Technology and Public Affairs Program on 
campus. 

"Adventures in Research" lecture series is sponsored by 
the Council of Provosts, the Public Information Office, and 
Third College. York's talk will be the final lecture in the 
winter series with four lectures scheduled for the spring 
quarter. 

York will. also teach a seminar next quarter on arms 
policy, Political Science 171, "American National Securit.y 
Policy," on Mondays from 1·4. A department stamp IS 
required to take the class.

Both sides seem happy 
with the agreement. The AS , 
is now drawing up plans as to 
how they will utilize their 
airtime. Although this air 
time has been available to 
them all year, they have not 
used it probably since there is 
sO little on·campus audience 

presently. 
The KSDT staff appears 

eager to make their station a 
success under the contract. 
"Our staff is eager to work 
with the campus," says 
station music director Rob 
Olmsted. 

"We have many plans in 
the works to increase our 
cooperation with the 
communications depart· 
ment, the music department, 
and other campus ~oups . 
Obviously our bIggest 
problem right now is our lack 
of . on·campus transmission 
ability, so the students aren't 
aware of what we have." 

The terms of the contract 
do call for KSDT to provide 
transmission to the entire 
UCSD campus by the end of 
winter quarter. OImste:1 
insists that all campus 
residents will soon be able to 
receive the quality radio 

, transmission he feels 
KSDT's music deserves.

Open'meeting bill cause's a fury 
Regents, UC say bill isn'l very courteous 

It is the public policy 0/ this

people's business and 
proceedings 0/ public agencies

-from the State Agency 

Open Meeting Act 
BY RICK DOWER 

S..,..a.-nto Correaponclent 
A major proposal to revise 

the way the UC Regents now 
conduct their business by 
including them in the above 
act will probably be watered 
down in key areas before the 
state Legislature is asked to 
consider it. 

A spokesman for Sen . 
Barrv Keene. D-Mendocino. 
who introduced the measure 
this week to force the UC 

Regents to hold their 
meetings under the same 
conditions as all other state . 
agencies, readily conceded 
the bill is "definitely open" to 
negotiation wi.th university 
officials. 

Keene's proposal , SB 252 , 
has already stirred intense 
interest in the three days 
s ince it was introduced . 
Apparentl y the measure 
came as a surprise both to the 
UC administration and tothe 
UC Student Lobby, both of 
which are generally consul· 
ted as a courtesy before a 
legislator su bmits a bill 
specifically directed at the 

- university . 
Lowell Paige, UC eresident 

David Saxon's chief 
Sacramento lobbvist. said thp. 

bill was "unexPected" and 
that Keene's office "must 
have gotten its signals mixed 
up" in not informing the 
university of his plans. 

So far, ' UC officials 
contacted have declined to 
comment on the bill except to 
say they are studying it. A 
spokesman for Gov. Brown 's 
office said the Governor, who 
appoints the Regents is 
interested in the bill. 

Keene's hill was prepared 
over the past several weeks, a 
relatively sho t time for a 
legislative measure. at the 
s ugge st ion of former 
Republican Assemblyman 
William Bagley , who 
authored the original state 
open meeting law and 
constitutional amendment

granting the legislature the 
power to oversee how the 
Regents convene. 

Basically, the measure 
seeks to force the Regents, 
who regularly meet in closed 
session to consider sensitive 
and controversial issues such 
as personnel, investments, 
endowments and operation of 
its two nuclear weapons labs, 
to meet secretly only under 
the same Gonditions as other 
state agencies may . 

At present, every other 
public committee, commis-
sion or 'board is subject to the 
strict Open Meeting Act, 
which outines narrow 
confines within which its 
members may decide to call 
for private sessions. 

The Regents have t heir 
own law, written exclus ively 
for them in 1969 by the 
Legislat ure, which provides 
many more r(la ons they may 
call for a clo ed session, and 
they take liberal advantage of' 
the privi lege. Keene's bill 
would repeal that section of 
the Educ-ation Code. 

Under their code, the 
Regents are entitled to meet 
secret ly for any of eight 
different reasons, including 
for discussion on matters of 
national security , endow-
ments, pending litigation , 
property acquisition, 
i.nvestments. personnel 
consideration and complaints 
against UC employees or 
officers. 

Keene's bill would 
substantially narrow those 
exemptions to just the few 
granted other public 
agencies, mainly only 
personnel matter s and 
pending litigation and 
possibly investments policy. 
More importantly, the bill 
would require all the 
Regents' subcommittees an~ 
advisory committees to be 
open to the public and force 
disclosure of person nel 
actions taken and the 
accompanying roll call vote. 
' The Regents rarely 
announce actions taken 
during their closed sessions 
on personnel matters, other 
than major appointments , 
and never announce the vote. 

No other state agency now 
has that luxury. 

Most recently, the regents 
have been criticized for 
unexpectedly meeting behind 
closed doors to consider 
promoting Jerome Siebert to 
Director of the controversial 
UC Cooperative Extension. 

Siebert ended up getting 
the promotion . despite 
charges from UC employees 
and union officials that he 
was responsible for the 
Extension's alleged discrim· 
inatory hiring practices. 

The Regents will probably 
not be able to charge that the 
Legislature is meddling with 
their constitutionally· 
guaranteed ' autonomy, since 
power to govern how they 
may meet is now vested with 
the Legislature, 

Donald Reidhaar, UC's 
General Counsel, said he sees 
no point in requiring the 
Regents to report a\l 
personnel actions taken in 
private and especially in the 
roll call vote. 

"It serves no good purpose 
to announce that the board 
may not have agreed on a 
particular per onnel matter' 
and could be divisive," 

Reidhaar said. 
He said that in his view, 

the Regents already comply 
with most of the provisions of 
Keene's bill . 

"If the Regents are doing 
these things already. then 
our bill really shouldn't cause 
them too much discomfort," 
said Greg DeGiere, the KeenE 
staffer who perpared the bill. 

deGiere readily admitted 
Keene is willing to negotiate 
with the Regents as to what 
specific exemptions should 
continue to be ~rmitted for 
them to lawfully call for 
closed session s. "The 
exemptions are mo t 
negotiable but [don't see why 
the procedures should be any 
different for the Regents than 
for any other state agency," 
he said . 

One of those procedures 
would require the Regents to 
be less reluctant to provide 
advance agendas and better 
background information on 
their monthly meetings . Th~ 
bill would also forbid the 
Regents from restricti ng 
public participation in any 
way from their meetings. 

Either by design or 
coincidt:nce, on Tuesday -
the same day as Keene 's bill 
became public - the UC 
systemwide news office sent 
out an unu s ual media 
advisory that one education 
wire service reporter called 
"astonishing. " 
, The advisory informed 
reporters that henceforward, 
the Regents would gladly 
make avaUable an expanded, 
earlier agenda for meetings 
and provide a listing of topics 
to be considered in closed 
sessions. 

-

The advisory also included 
a rather lengthy explanation 
of the education code section 
that -permits the' group to 
meet in secret for various 
reasons, an unusual 
departure for a body 
traditionally extremely 
sensitive on the closed-door 
issue. It exhibited an attempt 
at openness the Regents are 

• not now known for. 
Regents agendas are 

usually skimpy and not 
pu b1icly available until just a 
few days before the meetings. 
No mention is ever made of 
subjects to be considered in 
closed session. 

The timing' of the sudden 
willingness of the Regents to 
grant more information as 
announced via the memo has 
led to speculation that 
perhaps the university is 
seeking to defuse part of the 
impact of Keene's bill. 

But Sarah Molla, UC's 
systemwide public informa· 
tion officer, denied any link 
between the timing of the 
advisory and the bill, saying 
t he changes had been 
planned for some time as part 
of an overall effort "to 
improve communication. " 

The paragraph of the 
memo that states a list of 
topics to be considered in 
closed 'session would be 
provided may be misleadi~. 
Molla emphasized specifIC 
topics wou Id not be 
announced, only the general 
subject such as personnel or 
investments with no further 
explanation. In fact. Keene' 
bill would require no more.

students who attended 
yesterday afternoon' s 
meeting with ArmitGl.ge said. 
and Huffer said she would 
attend next week. 

American Civil Liberties 
Union attorney Martin 
McGuinn said earlier this 
week the ACLU would 
represent the Guardian in 
any campus disciplinary 
action, but hasn 't yet decided 
whether to go to court with 
the case. 

McGuinn will meet with 
UC General Counsel 
Attorney David Dorenson 
tomorrow to discuss ways to 
settle the question of access 
to CEP meetings within the 
UC system. 

"But for us," Huffer said, 
"that would only mean full 
access." 

The- National Lawyers 
Guild, Bekken said. has 
sUllplied him with a lawyer. 

The ACLU also said that a 
court injunction to keep ' 
Monday's meeting open 
would be almost impossible 
to obtain, citing the 
unliklihood that the 
Guardian could prove there 
would be "irreparable harm" 
if the paper was locked out, 
and the legal need to exhaust 
all methods of appeal within 
the University beforegoing to 
court. 

The Guardian has filed a 
request with the Academic 

Senate 's Executive and 
Policy Committee to be 
placed on the agenda for its 
March meeting. 

From there, the Guardian 
could appeal to the full 
Academic Senate and then 
Chancellor Rithard Atkinson 
before going to the court.

It is the second time this

"why should we ask people

Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel in their 1940 comedy, 'Saps at Sea.' 

New Laurel Bio. just "another fine mess" 
Stan - The Life of Stan Laurel by Fred Lawrence 
Guiles (Stein and Day, 240 pages. $12.95) 

In the late 1920's and throughout the 30's, there 
was 'no motion picture comedy duo as popular or 
beloved as. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Today 
they are generally regarded as the greatest team in 
cinema history, their child-like characters, ku-ku 
music and calamities recognizable the world over. 

And yet, while the career, life and scandals of 
Charles Chaplin have been examined in literally 
dozens of books and biographies, those concerned 
with Stan and Ollie have been limited to just a 
handful. . 

Now film historian Fred Lawrence Guiles has 
come forth with his contribution to Laurel and 
Hardy lore, and in the fitting words of Oliver 
Norvell Hardy, it's' just "another nice mess." 

this mess is entitled Stan - The Life Of Stan 
Laurel and begins where most biographies begin -
at the beginning. Guiles traces Stan's (born Arthur 
Stanley Jefferson in Ulverston, England) 
involvement in the theater from his initial 
pantomime act in British music halls owned by his 
father to his appearances in Fred Karno's famous 
traveling troupe as Charlie Chaplin's understudy. 
Here, in fact, is the most successful portion of Stan. 
In recounting a number of amazing similarities in 
the t:arly careers of Laurel and Chaplin, Guiles 
shows that the two men's lives seem remarkably 

in~rtwined from upbringing and heritage to 
talents and star-quality. 

Unfortunately, as soon as Guiles has Stan 
arriving in America and acting in films at the Hal 
Roach Studios (where he later made over 90 
comedies with partner Oliver Hardy), the narrative

gets messier and muddled in misinformation. 
Some of this rogue's gallery of falsehoods 

include: incorrectly labeling the Stan and Ollie 
silent comedy Bacon Grabbers a talkie and calling 
Double Whoopie their last silent (it wasn't. Angora 
Love was); stating that during the 1928 switch over 
from silent to sound at the Roach Studios, 
audiences could finally hear little rascal Spanky 
McFarland speak (the sound switch over was in 

. Books/Rick Greene 
1929, and Spanky didn't join the Our Gangcomedy 
series until 1932); implying that Stan had a "trick 
(singing) voice, ranging from a phony deep bass to a 
high falsetto" and that he used this talent in films 
(wrong again, this effect was ·achieved in comedies 
like Way Out West and The Bohemian Girl by 
dubbing, once using Chill Wills, the future voice of 
television's tal19ng horse Mr. Ed, for Stan's bass); 
and even describing the 1937 Roach feature Topper 
as the one in which Cosmo Topper could disappear 
at will (when every movie fan worth his celluloid 
knows it was the ghostly Kerbys who did the 
disappearing). 

Further, the book is filled with purposeless 
asides, like the two and a half pages describing 
Frank Capra and It Happened One Night. 
Interesting, yes, but it doesn't belong .here and 
sticks out as obvious and unnecessary p~dding. 
With so much filler and the numerous (yet easily 
researched) mistakes, how can the reader believe 

some of the more personal and faulty aspects of 
Stan's character which -Guiles reveals? 

Fans are presented with a quite tarnished view 
of Stan Laurel as a somewhat arrogant boozer with 
numerous marital and mistress troubles. At times 
the book smacks of the "Errol Flynn was a Nazi 
Spy, Joan Crawford tortured children, Stan Laurel 
was . an alcoholic lecher" genre of literary 
sensationalism, backed up by rumour instead of 
fact. 

Guiles' major source of information was Stan's 
second, third and fifth wife (he did have a marrying 
complex) Virginia Ruth Laurel, whose 
recoIiections were understandably colored. As a 
result, too much attention is given to what "Baby 
Ruth" did and saw and not enough to Stan, as a 
performer and creator of enduring cinema comedy. 
Indeed, the last 20 years of his life (which include a 
final, successful marriage, a cinema "swan song," 
several tours of England, a television appearance, a 
proposed comeback in a series of color films. Oliver 
Hardy's death, an honorary Oscar and his own 
demise in 1965) are glossed over in one short 17· 
page chapter! 

Laurel and Hardy lovers are best advised to delve 
into the two excellent biographies of John McCabe, 
Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy and The Comedy World 
of Stan Laurel. Throughout McCabe's works the 
reader gets a tangible sense of the man, feeling as if 
tl1ey personally knew Stan Laurel. But Guiles' 
mi guided effort consistently comes across as 
third-hand regurgitated information and presents 
the comic as cold , curious and bland . The fault, I 
think, lies with the writer and not his subject.

Titn Hardin: Sad End to memorable talent 
Late singer-songwriter influenced James Taylor, Jackson Browne and others 

tioned. as a popular songwriter 
would seem to have ended 
well before his passing. 

melancholy voice that 
presaged artists like Taylor 
and Browne by several years. 

He was, first, an introspec-
tive, poetic songwriter who 
implied more than he 
actually said in his lyrics. 
"Reason to Believe" was 
typical - " If I listen long 
enough to you!I'd find a war. 
to believe it's all true,' 
Hardin wrote, never fully 
explaining the heartache and 

whom he s uperficia lly 
resembled. Rankin uses his 
clear, pleasant voice to soothe 
and comfort - Hardin's 
lilt ing tones never masked 
his disappointment or 
longing. Hardin might be 
t:alled "mellow," but he 
possessed the mellowness of 
someone recovering from 
pain, coming to terms with 
loss. 

Hardin 's out-of-print LPs 

BY BARRY ALFONSO 
There's a scene [ recall in 

Paul Simon's One· Trick Pony 
where Jonah L~vin (Simon) 
and his band are playing a 
morbid guessing-game while 
enroute to a concert gig. With 
a casual, pass-the-time air; 
the musicians try to guess 
which rock stars have died in 
the last 20 years. Most of the 
names come easy: Buddy 
Holly, Janis Joplin, Jimi 
Hendrix. "What about Tim 
Hardin ?" someone says. 
"He's still alive," another 
replies. The impression given 
.was that Hardin somehow 
belonged on the death-roll-
it was a dark joke. but anyone 
familiar with what had 
become of his career knew 
why his name was men-

In the end, the guess has 
proved accurate after all. 
La!'>t nee. 29, Hardin , age 39, 
was found dead in his Los 
Angeles apartment. A known 
h roin addict for years, he 
had existed on the fringes of 
the Holl ywoo d music 
community as a sort of living 
ghost, playi ng to s mall 
audiences in clubs, remem-
bered by only a few. His name 
may not mean much to you, 
either, but chances are good 
that you recall his music -
"If I Were A Car~nter." 
"Reason to Believe: "Misty 
Roses," " Don 't Make 
Promises." These and his 
other better-known songs 
were written well over a 
decade ago - his importance 

Why. then. this memor-
ium? Tim Hardin, it's true, 
was no John Lennon - he 
didn't electrify pop music the 
way the Beatles or Bob Dylan 
did in their glory years. But 
in his quiet , thoughtful way, 
he made a real and lasting 
contribution to his era.James 
Taylor, Neil Young, Jackson 
Browne and others followed 
down a musical path Hardin 
helped to clear in the mid-
60's. He was one of the 
earliest folk-rock ingers/ 
songwriters, and to my mind 
one of the most moving and 
distinctive. In a time of 
histrionic, psychedelic rock, 
Hardin sang in a gentle. 

"His name Il)ay not mean much to you', 
but chances are good that you recall 
his music." 

Francois at Mandeville 
An evening of contemporary sounds and 

music theater , arranged by percussionist! 
pianist Jean-Charles Francois of the UCSD 
Music Faculty, Thursday, Feb. 19, 8 pm, 
Mandeville Auditorium, promises to be 
challenging as well as stimulating. 

Jano Negyesy in virtuoso flourishes, 
accompanied by an orchestra of flower pots, 
brake drums, washtubs, clock coils, pipes, 
coffee cans and a contrabass beaten with 
snare drum sticks. 

ambivalence he felt, but 
filling his sketch with a 
yearning that was st ill real 
and convincing. In the early 
'70s. Rod Stewart revived the 
song, one of a number of 
artists to have success with a 
Hardin tune. Bobby Darin, 
who made a hit out of "If I 
Were A Carpenter," was the 
most famous of them. The 
sentimental, fatalistic vision 
of Hardin became quite well-
known for a time, even if the 
songwriter did not. 

are worth seeking out, 
though the most recent ones 
are less impressive than the 
earliest ones. The dark cloud 
which always seemed to 
linger above him finally 
broke, and, with his public 
indifferent, his songwriting 
deteriorated and all but 
ceased. The man, too, is gone, 
leaving but a few noticing or 
mourning. Like a heartsick 
character in one of his songs. 
his passing seemed fore-
doomed . Unlike a John 
Lennon, there was no drama 
in his death. I will miss this 
touching, pioneering artist 
all the same. 

Francois, who spent last year performing 
and lecturing .at IRCAM, Paris, and Daryl 
Pratt, who was nominated outstanding 
percussionist of the year, will perform a 
piece for marimba , four hands, written by 
the French-Chinese composer, Tona 
Scherchen. The work is a subtle study of 
various marimba sonorities based on 
traditional Chinese musical material. 

In 'French composer Vinko Globokar 's 
music theater piece, two live bodies and 
their no-so-aiive instrumental extensions 
attempt an intimate relationshir' but end up 
facing the impossibility of rea unity. The 
four c haracters try to establish 
communication by playing piano, 
percussion, shouting. singing and actingout 
strange, dream-like gestures of violence, 
fear and frustration. 

But he had more to offer 
than his skills as a composer. 
He possessed a light, flexible 
voice which conveyed both 
soothing acceptance and deep 
s orrow , jazzy in its 
inflections and phrasing. It's 
interest ing to compare 
Hardin as a· vocalist to the 
likes of, say, Kenny Rankin, a 
s mooth-voiced jazz singer

Steinbeck's 'Eden' suffers on television 
When a miniseries comes 

on television, it can mean a 
number of things. Often, it 
can mean several evenings of 
·above·average entertain· 
ment, as evidenced by such 
notables as Roots and 
Holocaust. Considering their 
length, they were really Quite 
good. They do have their 
drawbacks, however - you 
have to make do without 
Latka and Louie for another 
week, but that's the way it 
gQes. 

Because they're so long, 
miniseries usually are high· 
budgeted affairs that are 
often preceded by a slick and 
thorough advertising 
campaign . The latest 
offenng, John Steinbeck 's 

shows whose audience can be 
divided into three major 
categories: those who have 
read the book, those who are ' 
too lazy to, and critics. The 
fir t group is probably 
p'rimarily interested in seeing 
If any justice is done to the 
book they r ad , while the 
second is either genuinely 
interested or merely seeing 
what the hoopla is all about. 
As for the critics - they exist 
to give everybody a hard time 
by flogging a dead horse, 
right? 

To start it off, let me state 
that East 0/ Eden managed to 
go a few steps above that low 
television standard. Not 
terribly far above it , but 
above it nevertheless. 

, 

break. Somehow, I get the 
impression that they, like 
everyone else associated with 
the picture, were actually 
impressed with the whole 
project. It shows, too. 

In all fairness, East 0/ Eden 
did have some good points. It 
had a good story line which , 
although obviously a 

Film/Rick Greene 

Steinbeck concoction, was 
strongly recreated on the 
screen. The producers were 
able to build a good 
framework for their show -
they just hung the wrong 
stuff onto it. It was also 
tightly produced. I found 
myself hating and loving the 
right people (although the 

same trick has been done 
with Dalkzs so maybe it's not 
such a big deal), and I was 
never confused on any point 
of the plot. In addition to all 
that, the camera was able to 
give us many delicious shots 
of sunny California, so it was 
an inordinately handsome 
flick . 

Disney filnt goes to hell 
With their latest live-action feature 

release, the Walt Disney Studios has gone to 
hell. I mean, with The Devil and Max Devlin 
they realty go to hell! 

character is hit and killed by a bus, certainly 
a rare occurrence in a Walt Disney comedy. 

TV/Michael Alvarez 

The Disney Studios have never been 
known for their live-action comedies, and 
not one of them has been worthwhile as 
artistic or intelligent cinema (excusing their 
excellent wildlife documentaries like The 
Living Desert and such half-Iivelhalf-
animated crowd-pleasers as Mary Pappins 
and Song of the South). Even such 
questionable "classics': from the early '60s 
such as The Shaggy Dog and Son of Flu Mer 
barely rise above the level of forgettable 
child fodder. 

With this twist comes the best five 
minutes of the movie. The sP,ecial effects of 
Max on his way to and arriving in Hell are 
stunning. Animated flames, eerie fog, large 
eyes in the trees, red and orange smoke 
wisps and a procession of floating, 
scream.ing people create a vivid and 
convincing Hell. Bill Cosby as Barney Satan, 
the General Manager, delivers his opening 
line with the proper chill". "Welcome 
to ..... Hell! .. 

East of Eden is no exception. 
Prior to its broadcast, tht 
airwaves were saturated 
with commercials featuring 
starlet Jane Seymour in a 
series of provocative poses of 
emotion-packed tableaux . 
That, coupled with the 
reputation of the novel, were 
enough to make expectations 
of the production quite high. 

I have not read John 
Steinbeck's novel so I hope to 
review the show at its own 
level, Without any biases 
gleaned from the book. Being 
a frequent tube peruser, I will 
try to judge it from a 
television standard which, as 
we all know, can be 
embarrassingly low. 

Perhaps the expectations 
were too high , but that 
certain Quality which gave 
the aforementioned Roots and 
Holocaust their classic status 
was· missing. Perhaps it just 
tried too hard. 

As for the acting, much of it 
was a lot of posing. Sure, 
that's all acting is when you 
really get down to it, but it 
should be convincing at least. 
Tim Bottoms, who played a 
pivotal character, gave a 
ridiculously fatherly 
mugging. The lovely Jane 
Seymour, who can be a good 
actress when she wants to, 
really didn't give it her all 
this time around. Still, I 
suspect that this perfor-
mance may be her really big 

Now the Disney folk are attempting to 
attract a wider audience (anything over 
seven .years old) and so The Devil and Max 
Devlin , a film which describes the word 
"bland" better than Webster could ever 
hope to, has been officially rated PG. After 
all, Elliott Gould (who plays the latter hali of 
the title) says "hell" twice, and that's a hell 
of a way to attract a larger audience. 

Our story begins with Gould , as Max, 
harrassing his tenants_ He's the manager of 
Grand Manor , a mismanaged apartment 
complex which he runs by the book. Within 
minutes, just after knocking aside a blind 
lady on a streetcorner, this unsavory 

It seems that Max will be condemned to 
level four (where your limbs are pulled from 
their sockets and roasted for eternity) unless 
he returns to earth to get three mnocent 
souls to take his place. These three, a 
hopeful young female rock singer, a hopeful 
young male motocross racer and a hopeful 
younger kid looking for a father, are typical 
film inhabitants . They're very nice and they 
smile alot. 

Here things turnl lackluster as Mary 
Roger's screenplay has Max racing from one 
of the three su bplots to the next in his efforts 
to trick the kids into signing away their 
souls. He exercises magical powers to gain 
their confidences, so Stella becomes a top 
pop star Grammy winner, Nerd Nordlinger

Composer Toru Take-
mitsu, whose music is noted 
for its gen tleness and 
delicacy, will participate in a 
program of his works, 8 pm, 
Mandeville Auditorium. 
"Passaggio," Berio' s 
powerful "messa en scena" 
involving members of 
SONOR , other Music 
Department musicians and 
artists of the community , 
under the direction of 
Bernard Rands, provides the 
second half of this provoca· 
tive concert. , 

A part of Takemitsu 's 
water series, "Waves," is 
written for solo clarinet -
William Powell, clarinet, 
three brasses, Thomas 
McCauley , William Wisen· 
hunt, trombones , Cindy 
Earnest, horn, Daryl Pratt, 
percussion; "For Away," 
featuring pianist Cecil Lytle, 
is "an expression of 
extolment of the Galaxy of 
Life - a Galaxy that is not 
the sole domain of mankind ," 
according to the composer.

wins a motorbike champion· 
ship and Toby gets Max for a 
new father. 

Stella the rock star (as 
portrayed by newcomer Julie 
Budd) is by far the most 
interesting of the three. She 
looks and sounds uncannily 
like Barbra Streisand and 
creates the most unambig· 
uous character in the film. 
Her scenes contain the only 
real energy to be found, the 
rest of the story coming 
across as deadpan plot 
movement. 

Both Cosby and Gould 
deliver all their lines in bored 
monotones. Even when 
Gould is hysterical at the 
beginning, he plays it 

. hysterically boring. To make 
matters sillier, since Gould 
can't see himself in a mirror 
(he's dead, remember?), he 
goes through three·fourths of 
the movie with little pieces of 
bloody toilet paper littered on 
his face until his romantic 
interest (Susan Anspach) 
gives him an electric razor. 

The comic highlight of this 
comedy comes hidden behind 
the opening titles. Max pulls 
his car up into a red zone then 
slips a phoney parking . 
tickets under his windshield 
so as to discourage getting a 
real one. A neat visual gag, 
yes, but from there on in 
there just aren 't any more 
laugh . It' a if some little 
devil pulled the plug from 
this effort and all the way 
through to its predictable 
ending, The Devil and Max 
Devlin leave viewers feeling 
a if they've ju t watched 
nothing.

Track teatn lacks 
depth for season 

The 1981 men's and women's track season is off to a slow 
start, as their first home meet has already been cancelled 
due to inclement weather. 

And if that weren't enough, the Tritons also face the 
problem of lack of depth again this year. 

"We have no great depth in any of the events," said track 
coach Andy Skief. "In some events, we have two or three 
athletes, other events - like the field events - we can't 
even cover." 

The best bet for the men's team is the possible return of 
highjumper Larry Flynn. With jumps of 6'·10", Flynn was 
among the top highjumpers in last year's District III 
championships, but his participation on the 1981 team is 
uncertain. Most of the other spots on the field team remain 
vacant, so the Tritons will have to rely on the middle 
distance and distance runners. ' 

In the 5,000 meter distance, the men's team will receive 
support from Keith Hill, Brian Barton, Brett Neilson, and 
Henry Mitchell. Emile Scoffone is expected to fill the 1,500 
meter position, while Tim French will compete in the 
decathalon. 

The women's team also suffers from lack of depth, but 
Skief is optimistic since the team has doubled in sIze from 
last year. 

Standouts for the women include Mandy Merse who will 
participate in the 200 and 800 meter sprints, Kim Steppien 
in the 1,500 meter, as well as Margot Kelly and Cleridy 
Lennert in the 1,500 and 3,000 meter runs. 

Ivazina Zuniga, a transfer from Chico State. will cover 
the shotput, discus and javelin. 

It's hard to get athletes here because of UCSD's poor 
facilities, but Skief has done a lot of work on the track and 
equipment to make them presentable.

Bu~s from the Budman 

Craig Kreeger. Jim Senz. Gil 
Ruiz. Hal Light, George 
McEldowney and Steffnie Bloss 
are all students at UCSD and as 
normal and r~lar as most of us. 

Yet they've all got this one 
hang·up that doesn't seem to go 
away. They aliliketoaccumulate 
points. It's like a good bottle of 
whiskey ... the more you get, the 
more you want. They even dream 
about them in their sleep ... like 
munting so many sheep going 
over the fence. Aa h! Love those 
points. 

Who are these weirdos, 
anyway. Normal, sane ... you say. 
Ah, c'mon! Honest , folks .... these 
people are just your average Joe 
and Mary. except when late 
February comes around. Then, 
they have to go to work. Gotto go 
get some more points. That's 
points as in Su perstars points .. . a 
whole method of madness that 
ha been going on for six years 
now at UCSD. 

are hooked into the 1M czar's 
complex·looking but simple point 
table. A competitor's marks in 
eight of the ten events are 
converted to the point ta ble. 
Points accumulated are added up 
for everyone. Most points wins. 
Simple. 

Don't be scared off by the 
SUPER in this traditionally 
relaxed event. No one needs to be. 
Being average and steady in most 
every event will always place you 
near the top. Neither Kreeger nor 
Senz, you may note, holds an 
individual event record. . . 

There's also a team rompeti· 
tion (S-person coed) for the not so 
brave. Everyone on the team goes 
for it in their four best events. 

In 1980, Team IMF (composed 
of Caroline Shugart, Darryl See, 
Jim Larkins, Carl Mar zk and 
Bert Royden) walked, ran, and 
jumped off with the champion· 
ship by ama sing 13,457 of 
those ... yep, you guessed

information on UCSD's 6th 
annual Superstars AII ·Sports 
Competition is now available in 
the Recreation Gym Office. Any 
UCSD student, staff, orfaculty is 
eligible to compete in either the 
individual or team competition. 
And yes .. . you may also compete 
in both! Team competition is 
composed oI5-person coed teams 

Kreeger, Senz and t he res tare 
hooked on it. Kreeger is the 
individual record holder with 
58(6 of them. Senz has the best 
career average (5304) ... and all of 
the rest have been former 
champions or runners up. All 

• except Bloss. 
She merely holds 3 ' hool 

records in the women's 
competition, all es tabli hed four 
years ago when she was a senior. 

Back on campus now 'as a 
pharmacy resident, Steffnie is 
setting her sights on Diane 
Ludwig's women's mark of 4699. 

Perhaps, none of these good 
folks quite got the point bug as 
bad as Eugene i)elenia. a recent 
UCSD grad and the only four 
year participant in the event. 
Delania racked up 19,830 points 
from 1977·1980 to lead everyone 
by a country mile in that 
department. 

For the uninitiated Superstars 
is the essence of spon . Ten 
individual sport s s kill tests that 

with each individual competing 
in 4 of the 12 events. Those 
entering the i'ndividual 
competition will be asked to 
negotiate 8 of the 10 individual 
events offered. 

Entries are limited. so don 't 
procrastinate! Th e entry 
deadline is next Wednesday , Feb. 
25th with competition to start the 
following afternoon at 3:30 pm. 

it.. .poinls! 
Rumor has it that they may be 

making a return appearance next 
week as they shoot for the all· 
time team mark of 14.149 set by 
the Schwabby Vees in 1977. 

All points aside, Supers tars 
was established for the sheer fun 
of competing and chall"ngin~ 
those tables ... a chance to make 
like BruceJenner or Susan Anton 
for a weekend and meet some 
crazy new people. 

Even AS President Bill Topkis 
tried his hand at Superstars a few 
years back on h is way to the 
White Hou se and didn't fare too 
badly . As a matter of fact he 
racked up 4189 of them and 
finis hed eleventh in a strong 
field . 

The idea here is that 
Superstarss is for everyone and 
not ju s t the athletically 
gifted ... and now that we 've 
belabored the point...please bring 
on those points! 

Casino Night 
Gormley. Berg, Bauman &

who are involved with the 
massive planning of this year'

recreational use, but is more 
into Winnebagos than 

backpackin~. 
Of course, it's difficult to 

s'light someone for his 
religious beliefs. 

But that doesn't get Watt 
off the hook. His new post 
gives him extensive discre· 
tionary power over public 
lands and their resources. 
While the Bible may 
influence his decisions, so 
will the development 
interests who have sponsored 
his former employer, 
Mountain - State Legal 
Foundation. 

One family friend says 
Watt will " bend over 
backwards" to accomodate 

environmental interests. And 
some corporate lawyers hope 
Watt doesn't jeopardize the 
working relationship they've 
so painstakingly developed 
with environmental attor· 
neys. 

But even if environmental· 
ists ask Watt for moderation, 
can he compromise his 
r-eJigious beliefs? 

For guidance, some say 
Watt may seek out brewing 
magnate Joseph Coors, who 
helped found the Mountain 
States Legal Foundation. 
Coors' wife, Holly, is also a 
charismatic Christian and 
close friend of Lani Watt. The 
complicating factor, how· 
ever, is that the Coors family 
also owns over 100 leases for 
oil and gas in Colorado.

Tolbert 
needs 
tenure 
continued from pale 2 
grounds on which the 
department can deny him 
tenure. African·American 
history needs to be 
permanent at this university 
and giving Dr. Tolbert tenure 
would insure this. Could this 
be what the History 
Department fears? Mind you, 
Black scl}olarship is the 
bottom of priorities as far as 
UCSD is roncemed. There 
has been a systematic 
elimination of Black faculty 
from this campus, with little 
attempts to replace them. In 
the last four academic years, 
not including 1980-81 there 
have been 155 ladder-rank 
faculty appointments, one of 
which was Black. O,.e! 
That 's 0.65 percent of the 
faculty appointments. While 
in those same four years five 
Black faculty have left. The 
number of Black faculty at 
UCSD has dropped from 36 in 
1974 to 18 today! 

There also are no Black 
faculty in Political Science. 
Economics, AMES, EECS, 
Mathematics, Psychol~, 
Philosophy or linguistics 
Department . This poor 
record speaks loudly of 
UCSD's vicious practice of 
keeping Black people outside 
of its doors. There can be no 
doubt of the relevance of the 
issue of Dr. Tolbert receiving 
tenure. It is an issue of major 
concern for this campu . Will 
the UCSD administration fail 
again where is ha continuo 
ally failed in the past? The 
jury i out and we are 
waiting ... waiting.
